('81', 0, 3, 4, 108) MY DEAR KUMARAPPA, I have hurriedly gone through your draft.
('81', 0, 3, 5, 169) It reads all right.
('81', 0, 3, 6, 189) You may circulate it.
('81', 0, 3, 7, 211) But I shall study it carefully before you meet.

('81', 0, 6, 10, 312) August 18, 1941
('81', 0, 7, 11, 328) MY DEAR IDIOT, This thing about the post is vexing.
('81', 0, 7, 12, 380) But what is one to do with a village P[ost] O[ffice]?
('81', 0, 7, 13, 434) The second vexing thing is your indifferent condition.
('81', 0, 7, 14, 489) Why should you not feel first class?
('81', 0, 7, 15, 526) Could it have anything to do with your having taxed yourself too much over Jamnalal?
('81', 0, 7, 16, 611) He is in rapturesover the kindness shown to him by you all meaning you and your.
('81', 0, 7, 17, 692) 1 The thought has just occurred to me and I have passed it on to you.
('81', 0, 7, 18, 762) Anyway it is time you got well.
('81', 0, 7, 19, 794) We had a glorious day here.
('81', 0, 7, 20, 822) We had prayers at which Gurudevs songs were sung, the morning Jivana jakhan 2 by Sushila and the  Anand lok[e] 3 in the evening by Prabhakar who is proving a fine singer.
('81', 0, 7, 21, 993) We had a pice collection from every adult and more from those who could pay more.
('81', 0, 7, 22, 1075) The Ashramites not having any money of their own spun for one hour and got one pice for their labour at market price.
('81', 0, 7, 23, 1193) Maganlal gave Rs. 2,500, Janakibehn Rs. 110, Sushila Rs. 500 in 10 instalments, i.e., Rs. 50 out of her salary.
('81', 0, 7, 24, 1305) Therefore, we have a goodly sum in Sevagram.
('81', 0, 7, 25, 1350) Ashadevi went out for collection and prayer in Wardha.
('81', 0, 7, 26, 1405) I have not yet had the report.
('81', 0, 7, 27, 1436) But it was good there too.
('81', 0, 7, 28, 1463) Vallabhbhais condition is bad.
('81', 0, 7, 29, 1494) You must have seen the report.
('81', 0, 7, 30, 1525) Let us see what happens.
('81', 0, 7, 31, 1550) It is a big load on the mind.
('81', 0, 7, 32, 1580) Mridula leaves today for Bombay.
('81', 0, 7, 33, 1613) She has come to solve her little difficulties.

('81', 1, 5, 8, 1960) SUSHILA, You were to leave one of your pens here.
('81', 1, 5, 9, 2010) I do not find it here.
('81', 1, 5, 10, 2033) If it is with you, it is all right.
('81', 1, 5, 11, 2069) I do not want a new pen.
('81', 1, 5, 12, 2094) There is a postcard from Nagpur today addressed to you.
('81', 1, 5, 13, 2150) It is a reply to your letter : The prisoner is not legally allowed to meet anyone.
('81', 1, 5, 14, 2233) And he does not wish to meet anyone in particular. So even if the telephone had been answered, you would have got the same reply.
('81', 1, 5, 15, 2363) I hope you did not have much trouble and could catch the train easily.
('81', 1, 5, 16, 2434) If you remember, write to me how many minutes before time you reached.
('81', 1, 5, 17, 2505) Do not fix appointments anywhere.
('81', 1, 5, 18, 2539) I do not wish to place any burden on you.
('81', 1, 5, 19, 2581) It would hurt me taking even a moment from your studies.

('81', 1, 10, 27, 2887) The difference is only one of degree.
('81', 1, 10, 28, 2925) You should fix your mealtime and also the quantity of food.
('81', 1, 10, 29, 2985) If this is done for a period, everything will be all right.

('81', 2, 3, 5, 3294) How strange my letter crossed yours.
('81', 2, 3, 6, 3331) You have used the same or a synonymous term.
('81', 2, 3, 7, 3376) You must get rid of your illnesses now.

('81', 2, 7, 16, 3726) TARACHAND, Many thanks for your cheque which I am passing to the Deenabandhu Memorial Fund.
('81', 2, 7, 17, 3818) If you do not like the disposal I can easily alter it.
('81', 2, 7, 18, 3873) I have purposely not moved in the Hindi matter because of the extraordinary riots in Dacca and elsewhere.
('81', 2, 7, 19, 3979) The matter has to be settled but the values have changed.
('81', 2, 7, 20, 4037) As I read the signs of the times the matter does not admit of piecemeal treatment.
('81', 2, 7, 21, 4120) I drafted my statement.
('81', 2, 7, 22, 4144) Sunderlalji did not like it much.
('81', 2, 7, 23, 4178) Meanwhile the disturbances affected me deeply and I stayed immediate action, my views remaining the same.

('81', 3, 3, 5, 4643) If we exclusively look after the cow, the buffalo will not perish, but if we exclusively look after the latter both the cow and the buffalo will perish.
('81', 3, 3, 6, 4796) If we try to look after both, then also both would perish.
('81', 3, 3, 7, 4855) All the world over people use mostly cows milk.
('81', 3, 3, 8, 4903) From the medical point of view, too, cows milk is more beneficial.

('81', 4, 7, 10, 6109) He has been held up in Bombay.
('81', 4, 7, 11, 6140) I think you should not have published a report like that without verifying it.
('81', 4, 7, 12, 6219) And even if you published it, to have made unfounded comments on it was certainly wrong.
('81', 4, 7, 13, 6308) [I] 1 cannot save you.
('81', 4, 7, 14, 6331) And, moreover, you have given the name of the Chief Justice.
('81', 4, 7, 15, 6392) I am afraid you will be found guilty.
('81', 4, 7, 16, 6430) You had better consult a lawyer and publish, before attending the court, an apology saying that your correspondent was unable to prove the truth of his report.
('81', 4, 7, 17, 6590) I think this would be a graceful step.
('81', 4, 7, 18, 6629) Or you may apologize in the court without defending yourself.
('81', 4, 7, 19, 6691) I am suggesting this from the moral and legal point of view.
('81', 4, 7, 20, 6752) But ultimately do as Sir Tej Bahadur and Munshi advise.
('81', 4, 7, 21, 6808) I am sending a copy of this letter, together with your letter, to Mahadev.
('81', 4, 7, 22, 6883) You have signed in full, but I can decipher neither Devdas nor Gandhi.
('81', 4, 7, 23, 6954) The civilized rule is that the letters even in a signature should be as neat as pearls.

('81', 8, 6, 17, 11269) I have respect for Dr. Sushilas treatment.
('81', 8, 6, 18, 11312) But I would not like to give her any medicine. Since she is doing very well, I am not insisting.
('81', 8, 6, 19, 11409) Mahadevs case is completely in the hands of Dr. Das.
('81', 8, 6, 20, 11462) I would not dare do anything else in your absence.
('81', 8, 6, 21, 11513) In other cases, I am of course doing what I can.

('81', 8, 11, 27, 11733) SUSHILA, I have received your three letters together.
('81', 8, 11, 28, 11787) Sardar has been released.
('81', 8, 11, 29, 11813) I learn from Mahadevs telephonic talk that you are going there today to examine his polypus.
('81', 8, 11, 30, 11906) You may go and visit him if he so desires.
('81', 8, 11, 31, 11949) Kanchan and Maganbhai are free from fever.
('81', 8, 11, 32, 11992) Neither of them had to be given quinine.
('81', 8, 11, 33, 12033) Just for trial I had given to Maganlal betel and calotropis leaf.
('81', 8, 11, 34, 12099) I cannot say whether these helped or the fever went down on its own.
('81', 8, 11, 35, 12168) Appa is doing well.
('81', 8, 11, 36, 12188) He had been put on vegetable soup and fruit juice.
('81', 8, 11, 37, 12239) He was also given a little butter.
('81', 8, 11, 38, 12274) From today he is being given roti.
('81', 8, 11, 39, 12309) He is feeling better.
('81', 8, 11, 40, 12331) He does not seem to have any complaint about his throat either.
('81', 8, 11, 41, 12395) Annapurna gets temperature up to 99.
('81', 8, 11, 42, 12432) Sankaran says that he has swelling of the throat.
('81', 8, 11, 43, 12482) He will apply

('81', 9, 1, 2, 12537) something.
('81', 9, 1, 3, 12548) I am feeling much improved after reducing the food quota yesterday.
('81', 9, 1, 4, 12616) I had good motion.
('81', 9, 1, 5, 12635) Eating more may result in a relapse after initial improvement.
('81', 9, 1, 6, 12698) This is my third attempt after your insistence on my increasing the intake of milk, etc.
('81', 9, 1, 7, 12787) I have also reduced walking.
('81', 9, 1, 8, 12816) The work is stopped by 8.30 p.m.
('81', 9, 1, 9, 12849) It is possible to stop talking altogether about important matters while walking.
('81', 9, 1, 10, 12930) In the evening I keep my eyes closed both when going out and returning.
('81', 9, 1, 11, 13002) That does not interfere with the nights sleep.
('81', 9, 1, 12, 13049) You must have got over the anaesthesia trouble.
('81', 9, 1, 13, 13097) Is not Jivraj Mehta in any way concerned with it ?
('81', 9, 1, 14, 13148) Are you taking proper food ?
('81', 9, 1, 15, 13177) I have written this with your pen.

('81', 9, 8, 25, 13498) He could get peace there.
('81', 9, 8, 26, 13524) He sent me a telegram to permit him to stay there for some more time.
('81', 9, 8, 27, 13594) I have said yes.
('81', 9, 8, 28, 13611) 1 He had a long talk with Jawaharlal and had fruit with him.

('81', 11, 1, 4, 15182) Sushila stopped for two days on her way to Bombay.

('81', 11, 1, 7, 15323) Her last experience enabled them to work an expensive instrument that was lying unused.
('81', 11, 1, 8, 15411) Kanchan has gone to her mother for a few months.
('81', 11, 1, 9, 15460) I am first finishing the Deenabandhu Memorial which becomes also partly Tagore Memorial too.

('81', 12, 9, 20, 17605) SEVAGRAM, August 24, 1941 A Discipline for Non violence is a pamphlet written by Mr. Richard B. Gregg for the guidance of those Westerners who endeavour to follow the law of satyagraha.
('81', 12, 9, 21, 17791) I use the word advisedly instead of pacifism.
('81', 12, 9, 22, 17837) For what passes under the name of pacifism is not the same as satyagraha.
('81', 12, 9, 23, 17911) Mr. Gregg is a most diligent and methodical worker.
('81', 12, 9, 24, 17963) He [has] had first hand knowledge of satyagraha, having lived in India and that too for nearly a year in the Sabarmati Ashram.
('81', 12, 9, 25, 18090) His pamphlet is
('81', 12, 10, 26, 18106) 1 To its first Indian edition published by Navajivan Publishing House, Ahmedabad
('81', 13, 0, 1, 18187) 14 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 13, 1, 2, 18228) seasonable and cannot fail to help the satyagrahis of India.
('81', 13, 1, 3, 18289) For though the pamphlet is written in a manner attractive for the West, the substance is the same for both the Western and the Eastern satyagrahi.
('81', 13, 1, 4, 18436) A cheap edition of the pamphlet is therefore being printed locally for the benefit of Indian readers in the hope that many will make use of it and profit by it.
('81', 13, 1, 5, 18597) A special responsibility rests upon the shoulders of Indian satyagrahis, for Mr. Gregg has based the pamphlet on his observation of the working of satyagraha in India.
('81', 13, 1, 6, 18765) However admirable this guide of Mr. Greggsmay appear as a well arranged code, it must fail in its purpose if the Indian experiment fails.

('81', 13, 4, 10, 18973) WARDRA, August 24, 1941 Being vitally connected with immigration problems and having been in South Africa for twenty years, I am naturally interested in the Indo Burma Immigration Agreement.
('81', 13, 4, 11, 19164) It has caused me deep pain.
('81', 13, 4, 12, 19192) I have collected as much literature as I could on the subject.
('81', 13, 4, 13, 19255) I have studied as much of it as was necessary to enable me to form anopinion and as was possible during the very limited time at my disposal.
('81', 13, 4, 14, 19397) My study has led me to the conclusion that it is an unhappy agreement.
('81', 13, 4, 15, 19468) It is panicky and penal.
('81', 13, 4, 16, 19493) In the papers I find no reason to warrant any panic nor do I find any warrant for the severe punishment meted out to the Indians resident in Burma.
('81', 13, 4, 17, 19641) The burden of proving the right to remain in Burma has in every case been thrown on the Indian resident.
('81', 13, 4, 18, 19746) One would have thought that the least that should have been done was to have automatically recognized as fully domiciled every Indian found in Burma on the date of promulgation of the Agreement.
('81', 13, 4, 19, 19941) I am acquainted with the immigration laws of South Africa and other countries.
('81', 13, 4, 20, 20020) In every case the restrictions have been imposed by legislation and, after fairly full opportunity being given for the expression of public opinion, legislation has been preceded by considerable lapse of time for the ventilation of views on the mere proposal for legislation.
('81', 13, 4, 21, 20296) In this case secrecy and mystery have surrounded the Agreement which has been sprung upon an unsuspecting public.
('81', 14, 0, 1, 20410) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 15
('81', 14, 1, 2, 20456) The whole thing appears still more hideous when we recall the fact that only a few years ago Burma was an integral part of India.
('81', 14, 1, 3, 20586) Does the partition make India a leper country the presence of whose inhabitants must carry heavy penalties including the tickets of leave such as criminals carry?
('81', 14, 1, 4, 20749) They do not cease to be less offensive because they bear the inoffensive name of passports andpermits.
('81', 14, 1, 5, 20852) I should be prepared to understand the validity of the permit and passport system when the necessity is clearly established.
('81', 14, 1, 6, 20977) I must refuse to believe that this Agreement is in response to a vital cry from the great Burmese nation with which the people of India never had any quarrel and with which India had enjoyed cultural contact long before the advent of the foreigner from the West.
('81', 14, 1, 7, 21240) We can never be in Burma or the Burmans in India foreigners in the same sense as people from the West.
('81', 14, 1, 8, 21343) There has been free commerce and emigration to Burma for hundreds of years.
('81', 14, 1, 9, 21419) This drastic Agreement is an undeserved slur both on India and Burma.
('81', 14, 1, 10, 21489) This Agreement is a brutal reminder that both India and Burma are under the British heel and that the Government of India Act and the Government of Burma Act gave no real freedom to the respective peoples.
('81', 14, 1, 11, 21695) They give no scope for full growth to us.
('81', 14, 1, 12, 21737) I fear that this statement of mine will not please the Premier of Burma who may think that the Agreement is a popular Act.
('81', 14, 1, 13, 21860) He will soon discover the error, if he has not already, that he has not served his people but that he has played himself into the hands of those who would want to exploit Burma to the exclusion of any rivals.
('81', 14, 1, 14, 22069) I must admit that Indians have been partners with the Westerners in the exploitation of Burma, but with this fundamental difference, that the Westerner went to Burma with his gun, while the Indian went on sufferance as he has always done in every part of the world.
('81', 14, 1, 15, 22335) We cannot exist in Burma for one single day without Burmese goodwill.
('81', 14, 1, 16, 22405) I would plead with the Burmese Ministers and the Burmese people that they should wait for the regulation of immigration till both of us are free and independent for such regulation.
('81', 14, 1, 17, 22587) I flatter myself with the belief that when that happy day arrives, as it must, such matters will regulate themselves, for we shall never want to impose our nationals on one another.
('81', 14, 1, 18, 22769) But I have strayed.
('81', 14, 1, 19, 22789) My purpose just now is to show that this Agreement must be undone inasmuch as it breaks every canon of
('81', 15, 0, 1, 22892) 16 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 15, 1, 2, 22933) international propriety.
('81', 15, 1, 3, 22958) It becomes less defensible in that an Indian 1 instead of an Englishman was sent to negotiate the Agreement.
('81', 15, 1, 4, 23067) It is an old and familiar trick, that of putting up an Indian to perform a disagreeable task.
('81', 15, 1, 5, 23161) Nor is it relevant that the Agreement had the approvalof local Indian opinion.
('81', 15, 1, 6, 23240) For the Agreement is an insult to the whole nation, not merely to the particular individuals whose material interests lie in Burma.
('81', 15, 1, 7, 23372) But even if it was relevant, there should be evidence to show the volume and character of that opinion.
('81', 15, 1, 8, 23476) When I come to examine the Baxter Report 2, which became the prelude to the Agreement, it contains nothing to justify the Agreement.
('81', 15, 1, 9, 23609) This was the reference made to Mr. Baxter:
('81', 15, 2, 10, 23652) The enquiry will be directed to ascertaining:
('81', 15, 3, 11, 23698) 1. the volume of Indian immigration; 2. to what extent it is seasonal and temporary and to what extent permanent; 3. in what occupations Indians are mainly employed and the extent to which they are unemployed or underemployed; 4. whether in such employment Indians either have displaced Burmans or could be replaced by Burmans, due regard being paid to both the previous history of such occupations and their economic requirements; and 5. whether in the light of the statistics obtained and other relevant factors any system of equating the supply of Indian unskilled labour to Burmans requirements is needed.
('81', 15, 3, 12, 24308) Thus it was purely a fact finding commission.
('81', 15, 3, 13, 24354) Here is the fact found by the Commission:
('81', 15, 4, 14, 24396) There is no evidence of any kind to suggest that Indians have displaced Burmans from employment which they had previously obtained.
('81', 15, 4, 15, 24528) Indian labour in the past has been supplementary rather than alternative to Burmese labour.
('81', 15, 4, 16, 24620) That surely does not justify the restrictions imposed by the Agreement on the movement of Indians in Burma.
('81', 15, 4, 17, 24728) The recommendations made in the Report appear to me to be in excess of the reference and therefore of no effect.
('81', 15, 4, 18, 24841) Add to this the fact that the opinion of the assessors finds no mention in the Report.
('81', 15, 4, 19, 24928) It may not have weighed with the Commissioner but surely it should have found mention in the Report.

('81', 15, 6, 21, 25091) 2 James Baxter, Financial Adviser, with two assessors, U Tin Tut and Ratilal Desai, was appointed by the Government of Burma to examine the question of Indian immigration into Burma.
('81', 15, 6, 22, 25274) The report was submitted to the Government of Burma in October 1940.
('81', 16, 0, 1, 25343) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 17
('81', 16, 1, 2, 25389) Now let me for a moment examine the pertinent sections of the Act.
('81', 16, 1, 3, 25456) Here they are: Section 44(3) of the Government of Burma Act, 1935, says:
('81', 16, 2, 4, 25529) The provisions of Sub section (2) of this Section shall apply in relation to British subjects domiciled in India and subjects of any Indian State as they apply in relation to British subjects domiciled in the United Kingdom, but with the substitution in the provision to the said Sub section for references to the United Kingdom or references to British India, or as the case may be, that Indian State:
('81', 16, 3, 5, 25932) Provided that nothing in this Sub section shall affect any restriction lawfully imposed on the right of entry into Burma of persons who are British subjects domiciled in India or subjects of any Indian State, or any restriction lawfully imposed as a condition of allowing any such persons to enter Burma.
('81', 16, 3, 6, 26237) Section 138 of the same Act:
('81', 16, 4, 7, 26266) His Majesty may by Order in Council direct that, during such period as may be specified in the Order, immigration into Burma from India shall be subject to such restrictions as may be specified in the Order (being such restrictions as may have been mutually agreed before the commencement of this Act between the Governor of Burma in Council and the Governor General of India in Council and approved by the Secretary of State, or in default of agreement as may have been prescribed by the Secretary of State), and no other restrictions:
('81', 16, 5, 8, 26803) Provided that any such Order may be varied by a subsequent Order in Council in such manner as appears to His Majesty necessary to give effect to any agreement in that behalf made after the commencement of this Act by the Governor with the Governor General of India or the Governor General of India in Council.
('81', 16, 5, 9, 27113) The first read as a whole does not appear to contemplate any interference with the present Indian population.
('81', 16, 5, 10, 27223) The second is decisive.
('81', 16, 5, 11, 27247) According to this Section restriction by agreement cannot be imposed on the present Indian settlers.
('81', 16, 5, 12, 27348) I have no doubt whatsoever that the Secretary of State for India should not pass the Order in Council and should withhold his assent to the Agreement.
('81', 16, 5, 13, 27499) Any restriction should be a matter for legislation by the Burmese Assembly in consultation with and with the co operation of the Government of India.
('81', 16, 5, 14, 27649) It is pertinent to the examination of the Agreement to know what declarations were made by His Majestys Ministers when the Act was passed.
('81', 16, 5, 15, 27788) Here is the assurance of Sir Thomas Inskip, the then Minister for Co ordination and Defence, on the subject:
('81', 16, 6, 16, 27897) Nobody wants to discriminate between British subjects domiciled in India
('81', 17, 0, 1, 27970) 18 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 17, 1, 2, 28011) or Indian States subjects when they go to Burma, any more than one wants to discriminate between the British when they go to British India.
('81', 17, 1, 3, 28151) Mr. Butler (then Under Secretary of State for India) also stated in the House of Commons:
('81', 17, 2, 4, 28241) In connection with unskilled Indian labour, the Governor of Burma is asked to confer with the Governor General with a view to ,regulating the immigration of unskilled labour into Burma.
('81', 17, 2, 5, 28427) The reason we cannot make a simple rule is that we have to make this differentiation in regard to unskilled labour, while at the same time we do not want to stop the free entry of Indians in general.
('81', 17, 2, 6, 28627) Such declarations may have no validity in the interpretation of the Act in a court of law.
('81', 17, 2, 7, 28718) But politically considered they have or should have the effect of promissory notes.
('81', 17, 2, 8, 28802) The Agreement is a clear breach of the declarations quoted by me.
('81', 17, 2, 9, 28868) I am glad that responsible Indian public opinion is being expressed in unmistakable terms in condemnation of the Agreement.

('81', 18, 3, 5, 29831) You have argued well.
('81', 18, 3, 6, 29853) Yes, one must take risks.
('81', 18, 3, 7, 29879) But the point is that even in doing so one must exercise discretion and restraint.
('81', 18, 3, 8, 29962) Even the additional information you have given does not justify your involving the Chief Justice.
('81', 18, 3, 9, 30060) You were free to agitate the matter strongly without doing that.
('81', 18, 3, 10, 30125) You could have taken that magistrate to task for describing it as voluntary.
('81', 18, 3, 11, 30202) And you could have written at length about what the man from the Punjab did.
('81', 18, 3, 12, 30279) I would endorse your going to the utmost length in taking risks.
('81', 18, 3, 13, 30344) But here I find your case weak.
('81', 18, 3, 14, 30376) However, if the lawyers permit you, you may follow their advice.
('81', 18, 3, 15, 30441) I certainly do not wish to dampen your enthusiasm.

('81', 18, 7, 22, 30764) The disease which goes back to many years is not active, but it cannot be said to have been completely cured.
('81', 18, 7, 23, 30874) He is on a special diet, etc.
('81', 18, 7, 24, 30904) Perhaps he will feel tired soon.
('81', 18, 7, 25, 30937) In this condition he should not be asked to go out unless there is urgent work.
('81', 18, 7, 26, 31017) Do you need any help?
('81', 18, 7, 27, 31039) If so, of what sort?
('81', 18, 7, 28, 31060) I see no point in sending Shanta 1 there.
('81', 18, 7, 29, 31102) If it is for her good, she can be sent independently after you have had sufficient experience there.
('81', 18, 7, 30, 31203) If you want her services, I think you will derive the full benefit from your stay there only if you check your desire.
('81', 18, 7, 31, 31322) This is mypersonal view.
('81', 18, 7, 32, 31347) But I will carry out your wishes.
('81', 18, 7, 33, 31381) I have still not asked Shanta.
('81', 18, 7, 34, 31412) Vallabhbhai has been released.
('81', 18, 7, 35, 31443) He is not suffering from polypus, and, therefore, there is no cause for anxiety.

('81', 19, 3, 4, 31694) BABUDI, I do know, of course, that the happiness and security to be found in living together are not to be found in staying alone.
('81', 19, 3, 5, 31825) That is why it is said that even the overcrowding of the dear ones is to be welcomed.
('81', 19, 3, 6, 31911) For Anands diarrhoea, add one teaspoonful of lime water or dill water or the two together to the milk.
('81', 19, 3, 7, 32014) You can make lime water even at home.
('81', 19, 3, 8, 32052) If you add water to pieces of limestone, there will be effervescence and you will get clean, sky blue water at the top.
('81', 19, 3, 9, 32172) Decant and store it in a bottle.
('81', 19, 3, 10, 32205) Add a teaspoonful from this to the milk.
('81', 19, 3, 11, 32246) Boil one teaspoonful of dill seeds in eight ounces of water, strain the water and add one teaspoonful from this to the milk.
('81', 19, 3, 12, 32371) Thus mix lime water and dill water with the milk by turns.
('81', 19, 3, 13, 32430) He is bound to benefit.

('81', 23, 1, 6, 37417) If you are going to stay there for a sufficiently long time, she may perhaps benefit a little by going there.
('81', 23, 1, 7, 37527) I think she should stay there when you are not there.
('81', 23, 1, 8, 37581) It may not even be necessary for her to stay there.
('81', 23, 1, 9, 37633) She does have the spirit of devotion in her.
('81', 23, 1, 10, 37678) What we have to consider is whether or no the atmosphere there will make her work.
('81', 23, 1, 11, 37761) In this life she will not look upon anybody else as her guru.
('81', 23, 1, 12, 37823) You are her guru and, therefore, you have but to command her.
('81', 23, 1, 13, 37885) Your stay there will be over by the time this correspondence comes to an end.
('81', 23, 1, 14, 37963) If you are getting complete peace of mind there and also getting all other facilities which you need, do not leave the place.
('81', 23, 1, 15, 38089) If you decide to stay on, or even if you dont, send a wire if you want Shanta there.
('81', 23, 1, 16, 38174) I will send her immediately.
('81', 23, 1, 17, 38203) I have exchanged wires with you merely because your wire left scope for further thinking.
('81', 23, 1, 18, 38293) It was necessary to think about both Mahesh and Shanta.
('81', 23, 1, 19, 38349) I have understood that you are sending for both for their own sakes and not because you want their services.
('81', 23, 1, 20, 38458) If your motive is to get their services, we will have to think in a different way.
('81', 23, 1, 21, 38541) There is no special news regarding Sardar today.
('81', 23, 1, 22, 38590) You must have got my letter of yesterday.

('81', 23, 6, 28, 38759) KAKA, I have your letter.
('81', 23, 6, 29, 38785) It will be very good indeed if you recover by the end of August.
('81', 23, 6, 30, 38850) Do not be in the least impatient.
('81', 23, 6, 31, 38884) You will be able to work in peace if you recover completely.
('81', 23, 6, 32, 38945) Do go to Allahabad, but before doing so have a discussion with me.
('81', 23, 6, 33, 39012) Amritlal has told me nothing.
('81', 23, 6, 34, 39042) Is there any man who never bungles?
('81', 23, 6, 35, 39078) What else is Churchill doing?
('81', 23, 6, 36, 39108) And what am I doing?
('81', 23, 6, 37, 39129) I still remember that Deshbandhu Das had flung at me this very word.
('81', 23, 6, 38, 39198) We should rectify our mistake as soon as we discover it, and go ahead.
('81', 23, 6, 39, 39269) If we again commit a mistake we should set it right again.
('81', 23, 6, 40, 39328) And, moreover, Raihana is with you now and she will cheer you up.
('81', 23, 6, 41, 39394) Yes, one thing is certain.
('81', 23, 6, 42, 39421) I will not burden you with any fresh responsibility.
('81', 23, 6, 43, 39474) We cannot by an unnatural effort break off the connection with

('81', 24, 1, 2, 39583) the Sammelan 1. It will break on its own when the time comes.
('81', 24, 1, 3, 39645) Our effort should be to see that it does not break.
('81', 24, 1, 4, 39697) I think Shriman will have to go to Allahabad.
('81', 24, 1, 5, 39743) Do go to Prayag.
('81', 24, 1, 6, 39760) You will be able to attend to several things there without much trouble.
('81', 24, 1, 7, 39833) But go only after you have fully recovered.
('81', 24, 1, 8, 39877) Tell Raihana that I got both her letters.
('81', 24, 1, 9, 39919) Both call for a reply, but I am going to keep quiet.
('81', 24, 1, 10, 39972) Instead of giving her a slap througha letter, I will do so personally when she comes here.
('81', 24, 1, 11, 40063) And I will give one to Saroj, too.

('81', 24, 11, 24, 40603) SUSHILA, Tari was agitated today.
('81', 24, 11, 25, 40637) Her temperature rose and Dr. Das was called.
('81', 24, 11, 26, 40682) I had been to see her yesterday.
('81', 24, 11, 27, 40715) She was very upset.
('81', 24, 11, 28, 40735) She was fed up with Varoda.
('81', 24, 11, 29, 40763) I had always had t he fear that she would not be able to stay in Varoda.
('81', 24, 11, 30, 40836) She needs company.
('81', 24, 11, 31, 40855) She is scared at night.
('81', 24, 11, 32, 40879) She asked for a male companion.
('81', 24, 11, 33, 40911) I sent somebody to sleep there.
('81', 24, 11, 34, 40943) Her fever shot up at night and she was scared.
('81', 24, 11, 35, 40990) If her fever continues to rise

('81', 25, 1, 2, 41103) like this, I cannot look after her unless I bring her here.
('81', 25, 1, 3, 41163) She too cannot stay there.
('81', 25, 1, 4, 41190) Now Dr. Das is asking for her case history.
('81', 25, 1, 5, 41234) Hence, you should put down in English whatever you know of it and send it to me.
('81', 25, 1, 6, 41315) She is my responsibility till you can take charge of her.
('81', 25, 1, 7, 41373) I shall get Dr. Das to help, but finally what I wish will be done.
('81', 25, 1, 8, 41440) Tari is a difficult patient.
('81', 25, 1, 9, 41469) I cannot say if she will allow my decision to be carried out.
('81', 25, 1, 10, 41531) This matter is strangely complicated.
('81', 25, 1, 11, 41569) You should not be burdened with it for the present.
('81', 25, 1, 12, 41621) I shall try to lighten it as much as I can.
('81', 25, 1, 13, 41665) Right now send me only her case history.
('81', 25, 1, 14, 41706) I myself do not have a very clear idea of her trouble.
('81', 25, 1, 15, 41761) You mentioned some gland.
('81', 25, 1, 16, 41787) But where is the gland ?
('81', 25, 1, 17, 41812) Today she told the doctor that she felt pain in the lower abdomen when it was pressed.
('81', 25, 1, 18, 41899) This was written before 11 oclock.
('81', 25, 1, 19, 41934) I may write more after your letter arrives.
('81', 25, 1, 20, 41978) Now the bell too has gone.
('81', 25, 1, 21, 42005) There is nothing from you today.
('81', 25, 1, 22, 42038) I am increasing my food intake.

('81', 25, 5, 31, 42350) Why a wire?
('81', 25, 5, 32, 42362) How can I reply by wire?
('81', 25, 5, 33, 42387) My meaning was clear.
('81', 25, 5, 34, 42409) We and ours cannot hope to derive anything out of what we have gifted away.
('81', 25, 5, 35, 42485) Draupadis argument has no place here.
('81', 25, 5, 36, 42523) You are right when you say that the result of your hard work should not be such as to prevent its fruit being used except in one particular way.
('81', 25, 5, 37, 42668) Why such fear?
('81', 25, 5, 38, 42683) Why such lack of trust?
('81', 25, 5, 39, 42707) Remain absorbed in your work and all will be well.

('81', 29, 2, 4, 46364) I am told that you have been saying everywhere that this fight must stop now and that we should take back the reins of administration in our hands, etc.
('81', 29, 2, 5, 46517) If this is true, should I not be told?
('81', 29, 2, 6, 46556) If you do hold such views there is no harm at all in declaring them.
('81', 29, 2, 7, 46625) And if you hold them, how can you continue as President of the B. P. C. C. 1 unless, of course, the majority of the B. P. C. C. also hold similar views?
('81', 29, 2, 8, 46778) But in that case I should be informed.

('81', 30, 9, 13, 48588) Read the enclosed cutting 2. See if you can do anything about it.
('81', 30, 9, 14, 48654) Perhaps you are the best medium.
('81', 30, 9, 15, 48687) Sarup 3 is doing something.
('81', 30, 9, 16, 48715) The Press reports are so hopelessly one sided that it becomes difficult to know the truth.
('81', 30, 9, 17, 48806) I wonder if my statement on the wretched Indo Burman Agreement 4 is published in the papers you get.
('81', 30, 9, 18, 48907) If you see Bajpai tell him I was deeply grieved to see him involved in the national dishonour.

('81', 32, 3, 4, 50859) BHAI NATVARLAL, I was surprised by your letter of the 25th.
('81', 32, 3, 5, 50919) From an auditor you have become a plaintiff.
('81', 32, 3, 6, 50964) Even if I have received complaints against you, surely I am not going to entertain them.
('81', 32, 3, 7, 51053) So far as I am concerned, you are free, having submitted your report.
('81', 32, 3, 8, 51123) Actually you have done us a favour by auditing the accounts.
('81', 32, 3, 9, 51184) Why should you feel unhappy?
('81', 32, 3, 10, 51213) You can make any marks you like on the papers with you.
('81', 32, 3, 11, 51269) If you think fit you may hand them over to Bachhraj Co.
('81', 32, 3, 12, 51325) Or if you wish they will deposit them with some lawyer.
('81', 32, 3, 13, 51381) The Navajivan office will need the account books every now and then.
('81', 32, 3, 14, 51450) I will certainly inquire into the charge you have levelled against them, but I must say that I have not agreed to inquire into their affairs, nor do I entertain any suspicion against them.
('81', 32, 3, 15, 51639) I cannot readily believe that they have all conspired with Chandrashankar.
('81', 32, 3, 16, 51714) Some of your remarks have appeared strange to me.
('81', 32, 3, 17, 51764) But I do not blame you for them.
('81', 32, 3, 18, 51797) You have stated what you honestly felt.

('81', 32, 8, 25, 52035) The manner in which you are observing the rules is excellent.
('81', 32, 8, 26, 52097) There is not only no need to send the yarn to me, but you need not send it to Kakubhai either.
('81', 32, 8, 27, 52192) You can certainly buy it.
('81', 32, 8, 28, 52218) It will, therefore, suffice if you send the amount which you think the yarn is worth.
('81', 32, 8, 29, 52304) Abhimanyus skein is excellent.

('81', 33, 8, 16, 53164) And, moreover, where was the need to send it to the Trustees?
('81', 33, 8, 17, 53226) You also were certainly at fault.
('81', 33, 8, 18, 53260) Students should have nothing to do with the servants.
('81', 33, 8, 19, 53314) What does it matter if they do not supply aniseed?
('81', 33, 8, 20, 53365) And if you do, not get tea you should put up with that.
('81', 33, 8, 21, 53421) Is this [habit of] quarrelling over trifles also what you learnt here?
('81', 33, 8, 22, 53492) Anyway Mahadev has had to apologize on your behalf.
('81', 33, 8, 23, 53544) And it is not proper, either, that you should lose heart about your studies.
('81', 33, 8, 24, 53621) There is no slavery there.
('81', 33, 8, 25, 53648) You are a slave only of your habit and your anger.
('81', 33, 8, 26, 53699) You should get over these shortcomings.
('81', 33, 8, 27, 53739) If you cannot do that, I can see that it will be difficult for you tocontinue there.
('81', 33, 8, 28, 53824) You should regard yourself forbidden to have tea in Irani restaurants, for is it not the rule that you will get tea only once a day?
('81', 33, 8, 29, 53957) Go to Mahadevbhai himself, understand from him what your dharma is and follow it.

('81', 37, 1, 4, 58266) His mortal remains are no more but his soul is immortal like ours.
('81', 37, 1, 5, 58333) Taken in this sense none perishes or dies; none is born.
('81', 37, 1, 6, 58390) But Gurudev lives on in a special sense.
('81', 37, 1, 7, 58431) His activities were universal, mostly altruistic and through these he will be immortal.
('81', 37, 1, 8, 58519) Santiniketan, Sriniketan and Visvabharatiall these are manifestations of one movement.
('81', 37, 1, 9, 58606) They were his soul and for them Deenabandhu left this world followed by Gurudev.
('81', 37, 1, 10, 58687) Our true homage should be to maintain these institutions which he is watching wherever he may be.

('81', 38, 8, 23, 60397) He seems to be in a cheerful mood.
('81', 38, 8, 24, 60432) We have not talked.
('81', 38, 8, 25, 60452) Most probably he will come there and also go to Delhi.

('81', 39, 2, 3, 61271) It is simply a coincidence that these essays on Practical Non violence are being published in pamphlet form almost simultaneously with Richard Greggs A Discipline for Non violence 1. The votary of non violence should read the two together.
('81', 39, 2, 4, 61511) Kishorelal Mashruwala is like R. Gregg a deep student of non violence.
('81', 39, 2, 5, 61582) Though he has been brought up in that faith, he never takes anything for granted.
('81', 39, 2, 6, 61664) He believes only what he has tested.
('81', 39, 2, 7, 61701) Thus he has come to accept non violence by hard thinking.
('81', 39, 2, 8, 61759) He has in his own life and practice proved its efficacy in a variety of conditionspolitical, economic, social and domestic.
('81', 39, 2, 9, 61883) His essays have, therefore, a value all their own.
('81', 39, 2, 10, 61934) They should help the believer in non violence in sustaining his faith and the honest unbeliever in resolving his doubts.

('81', 39, 5, 14, 62141) A person who is scientifically inclined does not take the truth of anything for granted; he tries to prove it himself.
('81', 39, 5, 15, 62260) In this way he develops his own intellect and also obtains knowledge of the potentialities of things.
('81', 39, 5, 16, 62362) Why does an apple fall off the tree, why does it not fly up?
('81', 39, 5, 17, 62423) It is said that this question arose in Newtons mind and he discovered the law of gravitation.
('81', 39, 5, 18, 62517) Is the earth flat like a plate?
('81', 39, 5, 19, 62549) Is it stationary?
('81', 39, 5, 20, 62567) Such questions arose in Galileos mind and he discovered that the earth is spherical like an orange and revolves on its axis.
('81', 39, 5, 21, 62692) Such discoveries have produced great results.
('81', 39, 5, 22, 62738) A khadi worker should adopt a similar scientific attitude.
('81', 39, 5, 23, 62797) Newton or Galileo did not ponder over the problem of Daridran arayana and of serving Daridranarayana.
('81', 39, 5, 24, 62899) They followed an intellectual quest.
('81', 39, 5, 25, 62936) The khadi worker has however to find a solutionto the problem of feeding the hungry masses.
('81', 39, 5, 26, 63028) That is why their attitude should be all the more scientific.
('81', 39, 5, 27, 63090) Why khadi?
('81', 39, 5, 28, 63101) Why not mill cloth?
('81', 39, 5, 29, 63121) Also, why not foreign cloth?
('81', 39, 5, 30, 63150) Why cotton cloth?
('81', 39, 5, 31, 63168) Why not silk?
('81', 39, 5, 32, 63182) Why not jute or woollen textiles?
('81', 39, 5, 33, 63216) Why the charkha?
('81', 39, 5, 34, 63233) Why not the takli?
('81', 39, 5, 35, 63252) I can go on filling pages with questions

('81', 40, 1, 2, 63439) like these but I do not propose to exhaust all the possible questions.
('81', 40, 1, 3, 63510) I want to touch upon only one question here.
('81', 40, 1, 4, 63555) Suppose for a moment that for one reason or the other India does not have or cannot run textile mills, also suppose that no cloth can be imported from abroad, can we then provide sufficient khadi to all the Indians?
('81', 40, 1, 5, 63771) We should not be satisfied with meeting the demand somehow.
('81', 40, 1, 6, 63831) The East India Company did this and to some extent this was done even earlier.
('81', 40, 1, 7, 63910) In those days people were forced to spin and to weave on minimum wages.
('81', 40, 1, 8, 63982) This custom was called begar.
('81', 40, 1, 9, 64012) We have to confess with regret that begar is an ancient custom.
('81', 40, 1, 10, 64076) It was not introduced by the British.
('81', 40, 1, 11, 64114) We may perhaps be able to produce enough khadi through begar.
('81', 40, 1, 12, 64176) But khadi workers cannot be trained to undertake such inhuman work.
('81', 40, 1, 13, 64244) Our intention is to help the spinners earn such wages as would ensure, after eight hours hard labour, wholesome and nutritious food, necessary clothing, comfortable houses and other amenities necessary for a happy home.
('81', 40, 1, 14, 64464) If it is proved that khadi cannot succeed under these terms and conditions, we should modestly accept the limitations of khadi and also restrict our activity.
('81', 40, 1, 15, 64623) Let me state my view here.
('81', 40, 1, 16, 64650) I have adopted khadi in the belief that khadi has all the above mentioned capacity.
('81', 40, 1, 17, 64734) I cannot adduce irrefutable evidence in support of my view.
('81', 40, 1, 18, 64794) Many of my activities are undertaken in good faith or intuitively.
('81', 40, 1, 19, 64861) But they are not conducted on the basis of inspiration alone; I have tried to place my convictions on a sound scientific foundation while propagating them.
('81', 40, 1, 20, 65017) I have made and am still making all possible experiments based on reason and I encourage my co workers to do so.
('81', 40, 1, 21, 65130) We have not found a solution to the problem posed above; we may perhaps never get it and I know it is a difficult problem, a complex problem.
('81', 40, 1, 22, 65272) It does involve a lot of statistics as also knowledge of economics, psychology, particularly of the Indian mind, and also of ethics.
('81', 40, 1, 23, 65405) A mere statistical solution will not do, nor will a mere economic solution, because we cannot ignore our most fundamental and vital principles.
('81', 40, 1, 24, 65549) We do not want to spread khadi through coercion.
('81', 40, 1, 25, 65598) We want to do our work by changing peoples sense of values and habits.
('81', 40, 1, 26, 65669) Hence our researches should proceed from all angles.
('81', 40, 1, 27, 65722) Khadi workers should intensify their efforts to solve this difficult problem.
('81', 40, 1, 28, 65800) This is enough for the day.

('81', 45, 5, 19, 72184) It has produced no effect on me.
('81', 45, 5, 20, 72217) You have seen nothing with your own eyes.
('81', 45, 5, 21, 72259) It is all hearsay.
('81', 45, 5, 22, 72278) One should not suspect a co worker on the basis of such stories.
('81', 45, 5, 23, 72343) If L. bhai had been devoid of character, the fact would have become known long ago.
('81', 45, 5, 24, 72427) He would not have been able to retain [the goodwill] of so many people.
('81', 45, 5, 25, 72499) Such a man cannot go on working ceaselessly.
('81', 45, 5, 26, 72544) I have of course talked to L. bhai.
('81', 45, 5, 27, 72580) He denies everything.
('81', 45, 5, 28, 72602) I would advise you to have trust till you get first hand evidence.
('81', 45, 5, 29, 72669) One can write to me whatever one wishes.
('81', 45, 5, 30, 72710) You are certainly of a suspicious nature.
('81', 45, 5, 31, 72752) You are not able to weigh evidence.
('81', 45, 5, 32, 72788) All the same I am sending your letter to Narahari, who will do what is necessary.
('81', 45, 5, 33, 72870) 3 And finally the path of ahimsa requires that we should trust to the last, and have faith that sin cannot be hidden for ever.

('81', 46, 7, 17, 73983) With so many of you doctors there, why should he have to spend one hour in the lavatory?

('81', 46, 7, 19, 74107) I suppose you know that Durga has not fully recovered.

('81', 58, 2, 3, 89057) Unrevised September 5, 1941
('81', 58, 3, 4, 89085) MY DEAR IDIOT, I write this during the silent hour, i.e., before dinner and before the post.
('81', 58, 3, 5, 89178) I have not heard from Agatha nor from Henry 1. But I saw H.s article in a magazine which contained the attack.
('81', 58, 3, 6, 89289) I thought I should correct him.
('81', 58, 3, 7, 89321) If you want to see the article I can send it to you.
('81', 58, 3, 8, 89374) And as I did not know H.s address I wrote to Agatha.

('81', 58, 3, 10, 89473) invitation as you would be in refusing every other.
('81', 58, 3, 11, 89525) I sent it to you so that you may know it and send a reply.
('81', 58, 3, 12, 89584) You were bound to refuse.
('81', 58, 3, 13, 89610) Before you take up anything you must be thoroughly restored.
('81', 58, 3, 14, 89671) Even as it is, you are giving a good account of yourself.
('81', 58, 3, 15, 89729) You remember the pamphlet containing the Lahore resolution 2 on Pakistan!
('81', 58, 3, 16, 89803) Two copies have been traced in the library.
('81', 58, 3, 17, 89847) I never anticipate evil.

('81', 58, 3, 19, 89968) Is that satisfactory answer, if it is any?
('81', 58, 3, 20, 90011) Do you remember your question?
('81', 58, 3, 21, 90042) For the time being you need do nothing about Narendra Dev.
('81', 58, 3, 22, 90101) I shall inquire.
('81', 58, 3, 23, 90118) I do not know anything about the Dehra Dun offer.
('81', 58, 3, 24, 90168) Prabhavati wrote for the transfer of Jayaprakash on the ground of ill health, which is patent.
('81', 58, 3, 25, 90263) Her application is summarily rejected.
('81', 58, 3, 26, 90302) They cant do anything because it is right.

('81', 59, 4, 6, 91404) SEVAGRAM, September 5, 1941
('81', 59, 5, 7, 91432) Q. Has the entry of Russia into the war altered its complexion and Indias attitude thereto?
('81', 59, 6, 8, 91524) A. The entry of Russia into the war has not materially altered the complexion of the war.
('81', 59, 6, 9, 91614) Expression of oral sympathy with Russia as a victim of aggression is not wrong but no purpose will be served by so doing so long as we cannot translate it into action.
('81', 59, 6, 10, 91782) Russia is not wholly free from blame inasmuch as she has allied herself with imperialist power though it may be for the purpose of self existence only.
('81', 59, 6, 11, 91934) Had Jawaharlalji, who is a close student of international politics, not been behind the bars and thus free to express his views, his opinion in the matter would have weighed with me.
('81', 59, 7, 12, 92117) Q. Can you, Mahatmaji, envisage the emergence of a non violent new world order in the Atlantic Charter?
('81', 59, 7, 13, 92221) I am not able to envisage in the Atlantic Charter the emergence of a non violent new world order of my conception.
('81', 59, 8, 14, 92336) Q. What is your attitude towards the acceptance of office in the Viceroys Executive Council by Congressmen such as Sjt.
('81', 59, 8, 15, 92456) Aney 2 and Mr. Nalini Ranjan Sircar 3?
('81', 59, 8, 16, 92495) A. I do not approve of the acceptance of office by Congressmen such as Sri Aney and Nalini Babu.
('81', 59, 8, 17, 92592) Such action on their part has undoubtedly given a handle to the British Government for carrying on propaganda in America to the effect that India should now be satisfied in that even well known ex Congressmen have joined the Viceroys Council.
('81', 59, 9, 18, 92835) Q. Is the satyagraha movement proceeding to your satisfaction?
('81', 59, 9, 19, 92898) In what way is it
('81', 59, 10, 20, 92916) 1 H. V. Kamath, Organizing Secretary of the All India Forward Bloc, submitted this report for Gandhijis approval who revised it in places, though not very materially.

('81', 60, 1, 2, 93262) different from the 1930 movement 1?
('81', 60, 1, 3, 93298) Has the policy of non embarrassment any political
('81', 60, 2, 4, 93348) value or significance?
('81', 60, 2, 5, 93371) What will be your attitude in case the Government conceded the
('81', 60, 3, 6, 93434) right of freedom of speech?
('81', 60, 3, 7, 93462) Is there any likelihood of intensification of the struggle in
('81', 60, 4, 8, 93524) the near future?
('81', 60, 4, 9, 93541) A. The satyagraha movement is proceeding to my entire satisfaction.
('81', 60, 4, 10, 93609) Pressure on a scale comparable to that of the 1930 movement is not being put on the Government, it is true, but that movement was different in character from the present one.
('81', 60, 4, 11, 93784) But the main fact that the struggle is going on constitutes sufficient moral pressure, so much so that the British Governments position in America does not appear to be quite comfortable.
('81', 60, 4, 12, 93972) The policy of non embarrassment is a logical consequence of non violence and in that way a political necessity, but I do not expect the British Government to reciprocate my chivalrous stand.
('81', 60, 4, 13, 94163) There is no possibility of the Government conceding the right of freedom of speech, but if they did so honestly, I am bound to call off the movement.
('81', 60, 4, 14, 94313) Bona fide recognition of free non violent speech would mean a large step towards independence.
('81', 60, 4, 15, 94408) Intensification of the struggle is not likely during the pendency of the war.
('81', 60, 4, 16, 94486) Intensification will come at the close of the war if it became necessary.
('81', 60, 5, 17, 94560) Q What is your attitude to the local kisan and mazdoor struggles?
('81', 60, 6, 18, 94626) A. I extend my sympathy to all local kisan and mazdoor struggles for their legitimate demands and such struggles cannot amount to embarrassment of the Government.
('81', 60, 6, 19, 94789) My attitude cannot be otherwise, considering that I myself have been the author of such struggles in the past.
('81', 60, 7, 20, 94900) Q. In view of the fact that the word non violence does not appear in the Congress Constitution, what is the duty of Congressmen as regards non violent conduct?
('81', 60, 7, 21, 95060) A. Though the word non violence does not appear in the Congress Constitution, it does in resolutions.
('81', 60, 7, 22, 95162) Though there be no resolution of a plenary session of the Congress on the subject of non violence, I expect Congressmen to abide by the A.I.C.C. resolution so long as it is not modified or altered by a plenary session.
('81', 60, 8, 23, 95381) Q. Acharya Kripalani recently, in reply to Sardar Sardul Singh Caveeshar, said
('81', 60, 9, 24, 95460) that the Forward Bloc is not a part of the Congress organization.
('81', 60, 9, 25, 95526) The statementon
('81', 60, 10, 26, 95542) Kripalanijis part has created not a little confusion and misunderstanding among
('81', 60, 11, 27, 95622) several Congressmen.
('81', 60, 11, 28, 95643) I personally hold that the position of the Forward Bloc in the
('81', 60, 12, 29, 95706) Congress is quite similar to that of the Congress Socialist Party.
('81', 60, 12, 30, 95773) Could you kindly

('81', 61, 0, 1, 95824) 62 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 61, 1, 2, 95865) enlighten me with your opinion on the subject?
('81', 61, 1, 3, 95912) A. Though the Congress Constitution does not recognize separate groups within the Congress organization, Congressmen who owe allegiance to such groups have every right to remain in the Congress in their individual capacity if the groups are not inconsistent with the Congress resolution and policy.
('81', 61, 1, 4, 96211) I never insisted that Congressmen who do not subscribe to my interpretation of non violence should leave the Congress.
('81', 61, 1, 5, 96330) The Congress Socialist Party is just as much not a part of the Congress organization as the Forward Bloc.
('81', 61, 1, 6, 96436) The Congress Constitution makes no mention of either as being component parts of the Congress organization.
('81', 61, 1, 7, 96544) The Forward Bloc and the Congress Socialist Party are on a par with each other so far as their being part of the Congress organization is concerned.
('81', 61, 2, 8, 96693) Q. Have you, Mahatmaji, full faith in a Divine Power moulding our destiny?
('81', 61, 3, 9, 96768) A. Yes, I have full faith in a Divine Power guiding the destinies of India and of the world.
('81', 61, 3, 10, 96861) It is this living faith that sustains me in the present crisis.

('81', 61, 5, 13, 96977) SEVAGRAM, WARDHA, September 6, 1941
('81', 61, 6, 14, 97013) DEAR SARANGADHAR DAS, Rajkumari is resting in Simla.
('81', 61, 6, 15, 97066) She wont be back before October.
('81', 61, 6, 16, 97099) Your letter to her gives a piteous tale.
('81', 61, 6, 17, 97140) This is my advice.
('81', 61, 6, 18, 97159) The men whose statements you have translated had no notion of the working of ahimsa.
('81', 61, 6, 19, 97244) If they had the courage of non violence they could not have come away alive except by converting their assailants miscalled Police without retaliation.
('81', 61, 6, 20, 97396) That would mean ahimsa of the highest order.
('81', 61, 6, 21, 97441) This does not come except by long previo us training.
('81', 61, 6, 22, 97495) It is rarely seen.
('81', 61, 6, 23, 97514) But if one cannot exhibit such courage, one must not be a coward.
('81', 61, 6, 24, 97580) One has not only the right but it is a duty to retaliate in a vigorous manner.
('81', 61, 6, 25, 97659) This again requires great courage.
('81', 61, 6, 26, 97694) I have, seen it exhibited successfully.
('81', 61, 6, 27, 97734) It should not matter how heavy the odds are.
('81', 61, 6, 28, 97779) Resistance may mean death.
('81', 61, 6, 29, 97806) It must be faced in preference to a cowardly resignatio to brutal and indecent treatment.Iti this self defence which is not taboo to a Congressman.
('81', 61, 6, 30, 97954) It is the inherent right and the bounden duty of a man to defend honour non violently if he knows how, otherwise violently.
('81', 61, 6, 31, 98078) There is no other way.
('81', 61, 6, 32, 98101) Such a man will soon

('81', 62, 1, 2, 98168) be able to learn the virtue of non violence.
('81', 62, 1, 3, 98213) But that is only by the way.
('81', 62, 1, 4, 98242) My advice is clear and emphatic.
('81', 62, 1, 5, 98275) There is too much of this assaulting in Orissa, assuming the truth of statements that have been sent to me from time to time.
('81', 62, 1, 6, 98401) If you have assimilated my advice you will act in a methodical and deliberate manner.
('81', 62, 1, 7, 98487) You will be at liberty to publish this letter with a carefully thought out programme as to how to go about it.
('81', 62, 1, 8, 98598) You may send me the draft manifesto for approval or you may come when you like for a discussion before acting.
('81', 62, 1, 9, 98709) The matter is too important to be ignored.

('81', 66, 6, 7, 103416) SUSHILA, I have your letter and the cheque through Prithvi Singh.
('81', 66, 6, 8, 103482) Why is the cheque of the Travancore bank ?
('81', 66, 6, 9, 103525) Does it give [a higher] interest or provide more facilities ?
('81', 66, 6, 10, 103587) Where can that cheque be encashed ?
('81', 66, 6, 11, 103623) It must be charging a handsome commission.
('81', 66, 6, 12, 103666) I shall of course make inquiries.
('81', 66, 6, 13, 103700) Can you accommodate both the sisters ?
('81', 66, 6, 14, 103739) How is it your studies get constantly interrupted ?
('81', 66, 6, 15, 103791) I shall not let you sit for the examination if you are not fully prepared.
('81', 66, 6, 16, 103866) There should be no question which you cannot answer.
('81', 66, 6, 17, 103919) If you cannot be so well prepared by April, then you may sit for the examination later.
('81', 66, 6, 18, 104007) I am not in a hurry.
('81', 66, 6, 19, 104028) The knowledge you have gained is not going to be wasted, and so, if it takes some more time, so be it.
('81', 66, 6, 20, 104131) Because, I also do not wish that you should spoil your eyes and health by continuously reading night and day in order to pass.
('81', 66, 6, 21, 104258) Passing in this way is no better than failing.
('81', 66, 6, 22, 104305) You have to appear for the examination not for name but for service.
('81', 66, 6, 23, 104374) How much khadi did you sell and where did you sell it ?
('81', 66, 6, 24, 104430) The Ashram is now becoming very crowded.
('81', 66, 6, 25, 104471) Vijaya and Vasumati have come.
('81', 66, 6, 26, 104502) Pannalal has come.
('81', 66, 6, 27, 104521) Some others will be arriving.
('81', 66, 6, 28, 104551) More people are eager to come.
('81', 66, 6, 29, 104582) How can I accommodate them ?
('81', 66, 6, 30, 104611) Just think of the size of the kitchen and of the verandah, which is the dining place.
('81', 66, 6, 31, 104697) Construction work is of course going on.
('81', 66, 6, 32, 104738) There is nosaying when it will end.
('81', 66, 6, 33, 104774) Nor can I fix a time for it.
('81', 66, 6, 34, 104803) Let God do as He wills.

('81', 68, 5, 8, 106651) BHAGWANJI, I have your letter.
('81', 68, 5, 9, 106682) I got Puratans also.
('81', 68, 5, 10, 106703) He is displeased that you sent his five year old note without his consent.
('81', 68, 5, 11, 106778) It is his opinion now, i.e., after five years experience, that Dada is a spotless and simple hearted man.
('81', 68, 5, 12, 106884) Bhai Puratan believes that the allegation against Dada is the result of a conspiracy by some Harijans.
('81', 68, 5, 13, 106987) I share his belief.
('81', 68, 5, 14, 107007) These people have suffered so much that they have lost their humanity.
('81', 68, 5, 15, 107078) This is of course not true of all of them.
('81', 68, 5, 16, 107121) We must bear with all this.
('81', 68, 5, 17, 107149) But while doing so we should not be misled into entertaining suspicions against anybody.
('81', 68, 5, 18, 107238) I understand Naraharis criticism.
('81', 68, 5, 19, 107272) It is a fact that you are collecting evidence.
('81', 68, 5, 20, 107319) In doing so you cannot but start whisperings among the people.
('81', 68, 5, 21, 107382) This would foul the atmosphere.
('81', 68, 5, 22, 107414) And, moreover, you are forgetting your sphere of work.
('81', 68, 5, 23, 107469) This is bound to interfere with your work.
('81', 68, 5, 24, 107512) Why do you make yourself a watchman of anyone in the Ashram?
('81', 68, 5, 25, 107573) It will be enough if others, you and I, all become our own watchmen.
('81', 68, 5, 26, 107642) Supervision is Naraharis job.
('81', 68, 5, 27, 107672) If anybody wants to complain let him do so to him.
('81', 68, 5, 28, 107723) You should plug your ears.
('81', 68, 5, 29, 107750) I have a beautiful figure of three monkeys, which I always keep in front of me.
('81', 68, 5, 30, 107830) They are three representations of the same monkey.
('81', 68, 5, 31, 107881) His ears, mouth and eyes are closed.
('81', 68, 5, 32, 107918) The lesson the figure teaches is that one should not listen to criticism of or see or speak of anybodys defects.
('81', 68, 5, 33, 108031) The original of this figure is found on a tall pillar in Japan, and was carved thousands of years ago.
('81', 68, 5, 34, 108134) We should engrave this lesson in our hearts.
('81', 68, 5, 35, 108179) I will hear what you have to say when you come here.
('81', 68, 5, 36, 108232) I am not inclined at present to send for anybody else.

('81', 69, 1, 3, 108446) But if Narahari is positive in his view, I would not disregard him and make any inquiry.
('81', 69, 1, 4, 108535) You may, with Naraharis consent, stay for 15 days or more.
('81', 69, 1, 5, 108594) But you need not come or stay specially for the sake of Nimu.
('81', 69, 1, 6, 108656) She will get somebody to accompany her.

('81', 69, 5, 10, 108843) NARANDAS, I have your letter of the 1st.
('81', 69, 5, 11, 108884) I have already suggested Jajujis name for Rentia Baras programme.
('81', 69, 5, 12, 108950) You must have received that letter long ago.
('81', 69, 5, 13, 108995) 1 Jajujis other programmes have been suspended in view of that visit.
('81', 69, 5, 14, 109065) He will be ready to give you eight to ten days.
('81', 69, 5, 15, 109113) I should now get from you the programme drawn up for him.
('81', 69, 5, 16, 109171) Chhaganlal 2 was here for a day.
('81', 69, 5, 17, 109204) He has assured me that he will complete [the figure].
('81', 69, 5, 18, 109258) If necessary he will go as far as Rangoon.
('81', 69, 5, 19, 109301) The papers report that you have had some rain there.
('81', 69, 5, 20, 109354) Did you have enough?
('81', 69, 5, 21, 109375) It is Prabhashankar 3 about whom I am not sure, but would not Champa 4 also be included?
('81', 69, 5, 22, 109464) Poor thing, she would do what he asks her to do.
('81', 69, 5, 23, 109513) And that is natural.
('81', 69, 5, 24, 109534) I had even gone to the extent of arranging that he should come here while Maganbhai 5 was here.
('81', 69, 5, 25, 109630) M. is in Delhi now, and will come again in October.
('81', 69, 5, 26, 109682) After spending a few days here, he intends to go to Rangoon around the 20th.
('81', 69, 5, 27, 109759) I got your letter afterwards.
('81', 69, 5, 28, 109789) Information about Jajuji is enclosed.
('81', 69, 5, 29, 109827) It is better that my message should be conveyed by Jajuji himself.
('81', 69, 5, 30, 109894) It is too early just yet.

('81', 70, 2, 4, 110393) But, considering your circumstances, I should not expect a letter from you daily.
('81', 70, 2, 5, 110475) I have left it entirely to you to decide where Pyarelal has to be operated upon for his gland.
('81', 70, 2, 6, 110570) You alone can say where it would be best to have it.
('81', 70, 2, 7, 110623) Your convenience will no doubt be a factor to consider.
('81', 70, 2, 8, 110679) You will get this on Tuesday.
('81', 70, 2, 9, 110709) You must free yourself from there on Friday.
('81', 70, 2, 10, 110754) I should not worry if you are required there for two or three days.
('81', 70, 2, 11, 110822) But it is possible that the operation may not be over by that time and you may not be able to free yourself from there in time.
('81', 70, 2, 12, 110950) The earliest it can be done in Delhi would be on the 16th.
('81', 70, 2, 13, 111009) Pyarelal can reach there on the 11th at the earliest.
('81', 70, 2, 14, 111063) He will have to spend five days there.
('81', 70, 2, 15, 111102) If it is necessary, he may as well spend those days with Mother.
('81', 70, 2, 16, 111167) Now think about it yourself.

('81', 70, 6, 23, 111418) I do not think it advisable for you to have the operation in Wardha.
('81', 70, 6, 24, 111487) If facilities are easily available in Bombay or Delhi, I see no need to have it done in Wardha.
('81', 70, 6, 25, 111583) I would go by Sushilas decision in this matter.
('81', 70, 6, 26, 111631) If she decides in favour of Bombay, it does not matter if she has to waste two or three days.
('81', 70, 6, 27, 111725) But she would probably prefer Delhi.
('81', 70, 6, 28, 111762) She can give more personal attention there.
('81', 70, 6, 29, 111806) In my opinion Sushila should reach Delhi by the 15th.
('81', 70, 6, 30, 111860) I would consider unavoidable the time spent in undergoing the operation.
('81', 70, 6, 31, 111933) One may take into consideration the effect it may have on others.
('81', 70, 6, 32, 111999) But I would treat it as of very little importance.
('81', 70, 6, 33, 112050) The main thing is the effect it may have on me and on you.
('81', 70, 6, 34, 112109) I do not think it will make any difference in this regard.
('81', 70, 6, 35, 112168) I would not like to detain you with me.
('81', 70, 6, 36, 112208) I would also not like it if you stayed on there or in Delhi without any

('81', 71, 6, 12, 112716) So when the mind is not reciting Ramanama or doing His work, then the Devil takes possession of it.
('81', 71, 6, 13, 112816) So when evil thoughts invade the mind, the only way to check their attack is to recite Ramanama and to do Ramas work.
('81', 71, 6, 14, 112934) It can never fail.
('81', 71, 6, 15, 112953) Go on increasing the recitation of Ramanama till you succeed.

('81', 79, 1, 3, 124024) All this is so clear that you should have no difficulty in understanding it.
('81', 79, 1, 4, 124101) But if you do have any, please find some time to come over here at least to get your doubt resolved.
('81', 79, 1, 5, 124202) This is a very important issue.
('81', 79, 1, 6, 124234) In the context in which you made your statement 1, it does not at all seem proper.
('81', 79, 1, 7, 124317) The fight about Pakistan is a fight between two brothers.
('81', 79, 1, 8, 124375) One can get reconciled to one brother being defeated at the hands of the other; but the one who wins with the help of a third party will himself become a slave and also make the other a slave.
('81', 79, 1, 9, 124568) Whom are the British helping today?
('81', 79, 1, 10, 124604) Where does Pakistan exist in the present situation?
('81', 79, 1, 11, 124656) Akhanda Hindustan 2, on the other hand, does exist as a dream at any rate.
('81', 79, 1, 12, 124731) He who seeks to realize that dream may be no more than a dust particle floating in the sky but after all it is floating.
('81', 79, 1, 13, 124852) Its dream lifts it above; it does not cast it down.
('81', 79, 1, 14, 124904) Its exercise of individual freedom makes it shine brightly in the sky.
('81', 79, 1, 15, 124975) Whose help can it require?
('81', 79, 1, 16, 125002) And if all the particles get together, that is, recognize their individuality, then they themselves will be the sky.
('81', 79, 1, 17, 125119) Can you conceive a sky without particles?
('81', 79, 1, 18, 125161) You, therefore, who are out to fight for an Akhanda Hindustan can never entertain the idea of seeking external help.
('81', 79, 1, 19, 125278) It does you no credit.
('81', 79, 1, 20, 125301) It ill becomes the maturity of your thinking.
('81', 79, 1, 21, 125347) If I go on further I would be only wasting time.
('81', 79, 1, 22, 125396) But what need to argue at length with the wise?

('81', 79, 6, 31, 126002) If need be, we shall seek the help of a friendly power.
('81', 79, 6, 32, 126058) If necessary we shall stand at the bar of the world and ask it to help us to avoid a catastrophe which would destroy the life of the 400 millions of men. 2 Undivided India.

('81', 80, 7, 14, 126924) I interviewed Gandhiji today and asked him a few questions on Mr. Churchills
('81', 80, 8, 15, 127001) reference to India in his latest speech 3 in the Commons.
('81', 80, 8, 16, 127059) Gandhiji declined to answer any
('81', 80, 9, 17, 127091) question.
('81', 80, 9, 18, 127101) Then I asked him; I see you are disinclined to answer the most important and
('81', 80, 10, 19, 127178) relevant questions that I put to you.
('81', 80, 10, 20, 127216) Do you think that this silence of yours is helpful for
('81', 80, 11, 21, 127271) the cause of Indian independence for which the Congress is fighting? Gandhiji replied: If I did not believe so I would have come out with a statement without any prompting from you.
('81', 80, 11, 22, 127453) But I sincerely believe that my silence is much more eloquent than any words that I may utter.

('81', 82, 1, 6, 129652) It has become cheap nowadays to celebrate various days.
('81', 82, 1, 7, 129708) Peoples response is also lukewarm.

('81', 82, 4, 19, 130291) I am clear in my mind that Raghavadas could be free of his weakness only by admitting fully the mistakes committed.
('81', 82, 4, 20, 130407) Without such purification he is likely to do only harm.
('81', 82, 4, 21, 130463) He is a good man; so without such admission the harm would be greater.
('81', 82, 4, 22, 130534) One sign of goodness is owning a mistake openly.
('81', 82, 4, 23, 130583) For a satyagrahi there is no other course.
('81', 82, 4, 24, 130626) So the first thing to do is to find out some nice reliable person who would talk to him.

('81', 85, 5, 11, 134467) The Quaid e Azam has made no definite proposal.

('81', 85, 5, 14, 134685) The charges against the Congress have been disproved, but if they have not they can be referred to an impartial tribunal.
('81', 85, 5, 15, 134807) As long as the policy of keeping at a distance from both the Government and the Congress and using concessions by either side for extracting more from the other remains, no understanding seems possible.
('81', 85, 5, 16, 135010) A party following such a policy will never be satisfied with what it gets.

('81', 86, 3, 4, 135917) BHAI VALLABHBHAI, I have your letter.
('81', 86, 3, 5, 135955) I am sending you a copy of my reply to Subedar.
('81', 86, 3, 6, 136003) 1 I think he will come round.
('81', 86, 3, 7, 136033) Is it not our policy to secure the utmost possible co operation from men of all temperaments and abilities?
('81', 86, 3, 8, 136141) Do not worry about anything just now.
('81', 86, 3, 9, 136179) Your health must mend completely.
('81', 86, 3, 10, 136213) If homoeopathy helps you, I will begin to have some faith in it.
('81', 86, 3, 11, 136278) I have never been able to put any faith in it.
('81', 86, 3, 12, 136325) I entrusted a case to a homoeopath but there was no result.
('81', 86, 3, 13, 136385) It was Taris 2. But this is only by the way.
('81', 86, 3, 14, 136430) I do wish homeopathy benefits you.
('81', 86, 3, 15, 136465) I have heard much about it.
('81', 86, 3, 16, 136493) Das 3 believed in it, and so did Motilalji and Gurudev.
('81', 86, 3, 17, 136549) Does not our Lakshmidas also believe in it?
('81', 86, 3, 18, 136593) But finally everybody takes refuge in allopathy.
('81', 86, 3, 19, 136642) All this is beside the point, but let it be.
('81', 86, 3, 20, 136687) We are concerned only with the result.

('81', 95, 8, 11, 149453) I have sent a message for women and children to this effect: 2
('81', 95, 9, 12, 149516) Enough khadi can be produced if children up to the age of twelve and women gave a few hours of their spare time to spinning and other processes of khadi production.
('81', 95, 9, 13, 149681) I had asked Krishnadas Gandhi to work out some figures to prove the above contention.
('81', 95, 9, 14, 149767) I give below an abstract of the findings.
('81', 95, 9, 15, 149809) Indias population was estimated at about 35 crores in the 1931 census.
('81', 95, 9, 16, 149880) Children in the age group of eight to twelve numbered about 4_ crores and women and girls above the age of 12 numbered about 11 crores.
('81', 95, 9, 17, 150016) If the children devoted four hours to cleaning, carding and spinning and if the women devoted four hours to cleaning, carding, spinning and weaving daily, enough khadi can be produced.
('81', 95, 9, 18, 150201) It can be shown by calculation that the children can produce every day yarn of ten to twelve counts that can be woven into 90 lac square yards of khadi, whereas the women can produce every day two crore square yards of twenty counts in addition to weaving the ninety lac square yards of khadi out of the yarn spun by the children.
('81', 95, 9, 19, 150532) It has been calculated that the entire process from the cleaning of cotton to weaving a 20 counts square yard of cloth involves 18 hours of labour on the part of one person.
('81', 95, 9, 20, 150706) Out of this half an hour will go to the cleaning of cotton, two hours for carding, 12 hours for spinning, one hour for
('81', 95, 10, 21, 150825) 1 This was in reply to the addressees letter forwarded by the jail authorities on September 17, 1941. 2 VideMessage to People of Ahmedabad, 8 9 1941
('81', 96, 0, 1, 150974) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 97
('81', 96, 1, 2, 151020) unwinding the yarn, one hour for making and fixing the warp and sizing and one and a half hours for actual weaving.
('81', 96, 1, 3, 151136) This is the breakdown of the total of 18 hours.
('81', 96, 1, 4, 151184) It is based on the average skill of an average person.
('81', 96, 1, 5, 151239) An efficient worker may complete this process in just 15 hours.
('81', 96, 1, 6, 151303) On a rough estimate the women and children can, with such skill as they have, produce about 30 square yards of khadi for every person in this country by working four hours a day for 300 days in a year.
('81', 96, 1, 7, 151505) My object in publishing this abstract is to encourage an institution to undertake an experiment to corroborate it.
('81', 96, 1, 8, 151620) Any family can easily produce all the cloth that it requires by introducing a charkha and a loom in their home.
('81', 96, 1, 9, 151732) Suppose there are 35 individuals in an institution including four children in the age group of 8 to 12 and 11 women above the age of 13. All men, of course, will be busy with other activities.
('81', 96, 1, 10, 151925) Ten out of the eleven women and all the four children can devote three to four hours every day to cleaning, carding, spinning and weaving according to their convenience.
('81', 96, 1, 11, 152095) One of the ten women will help the four children and will also weave the yarn produced by the children.
('81', 96, 1, 12, 152199) The remaining nine women will undertake all the work from cleaning to weaving.
('81', 96, 1, 13, 152278) According to the calculations given above, the four children together with one woman will produce at least three fourths of a square yard of 10 to 12 counts khadi every day and the 9 women will easily produce two square yards of 20 counts khadi every day.
('81', 96, 1, 14, 152534) If we calculate for 300 days in a year, all of them will together produce 225 square yards of coarse khadi and 600 square yards of fine khadi.
('81', 96, 1, 15, 152677) Thus a total of 825 square yards of cloth will be available for the 35 persons or, in other words, everyone will get 23_ square yards of cloth.
('81', 96, 1, 16, 152821) As the efficiency grows every individual will be able to get 27_ square yards of cloth.
('81', 96, 1, 17, 152909) It should be remembered that so much cloth can be produced even in less time by using the now improved charkhas and carding bows.
('81', 96, 1, 18, 153039) If every home has a charkha and a loom we can produce the cloth we need with very little effort.
('81', 96, 1, 19, 153136) It will create a great contentment in the home.
('81', 96, 1, 20, 153184) We can only imagine what an impact this can have on our lives and how it can inspire all the people.
('81', 96, 1, 21, 153285) But for oneself one can instantly discover this bliss.

('81', 97, 2, 3, 153496) It is a good augury that votaries of non violence often raise fine questions of principle.
('81', 97, 2, 4, 153587) Man advances through such spirit of inquiry, but there is a prerequisite condition to it.
('81', 97, 2, 5, 153677) The inquiry should not be like that of a person who strains at a gnat and swallows a camel.
('81', 97, 2, 6, 153769) Raising such questions profit only him who is ever vigilant in major matters and whose practice keeps pace with the progress of the principle.
('81', 97, 2, 7, 153912) Let me illustrate what I mean.
('81', 97, 2, 8, 153943) A certain khadi bhandar received an order for woollen blankets from the military.
('81', 97, 2, 9, 154025) The bhandar authorities asked me whether they could accept it replied that they could.
('81', 97, 2, 10, 154112) The question of principle raised was whether it did not amount to helping the war.
('81', 97, 2, 11, 154195) As a matter of abstract principle, it will have to be conceded that the acceptance was a breach.
('81', 97, 2, 12, 154292) But in that case, we must leave India and every country engaged in the war.
('81', 97, 2, 13, 154368) Because we help war in purchasing the very food we eat.
('81', 97, 2, 14, 154424) We do the same when we travel by train or buy postage stamps.
('81', 97, 2, 15, 154486) Our use of the currency itself is an aid to war.
('81', 97, 2, 16, 154535) In fact we are hardly able to do any act which is free from the taint.
('81', 97, 2, 17, 154606) The truth is that no one is able to act upon a great principle, like that of non violence, in its entirety.
('81', 97, 2, 18, 154714) Like the geometrical line, it can only be imagined, but never drawn.
('81', 97, 2, 19, 154783) In practice, we have to be content with drawing only such fine lines as we can with our instruments.
('81', 97, 2, 20, 154884) There is no wall which can be called straight according to Euclid.
('81', 97, 2, 21, 154951) And yet, walls have stood the test of time for thousands of years.
('81', 97, 2, 22, 155018) It is the same with ahimsa.
('81', 97, 2, 23, 155046) We must put it into practice as best as we can.
('81', 97, 2, 24, 155094) It would have been easy for me to forbid the sale of the blankets.
('81', 97, 2, 25, 155161) It was a question of only a few thousand rupees, a small amount for an establishment whose turnover is in lakhs.
('81', 97, 2, 26, 155274) But the prohibition would have been a matter of shame for me.
('81', 97, 2, 27, 155336) I could have done so only by concealing my real view of the matter.
('81', 97, 2, 28, 155404) Where should I draw the line from which such prohibition should commence?
('81', 97, 2, 29, 155478) If I were a grain merchant, should I decline to sell it to soldiers?
('81', 97, 2, 30, 155547) Or, if I were a chemist, should I refuse to sell quinine and other drugs to them?
('81', 97, 2, 31, 155629) If I should, what c ould be the reason for my doing so?
('81', 97, 2, 32, 155685) Does my ahimsa prevent me from entertaining such customers?
('81', 97, 2, 33, 155745) In other words, does it require of me to look into the occupations of my customers?
('81', 98, 0, 1, 155829) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 99
('81', 98, 1, 2, 155875) clear reply is that provided I deal in goods which conduce to the welfare of society, I may not look into the occupations of my customers.
('81', 98, 1, 3, 156014) This means that I may sell my innocuous articles even to soldiers.

('81', 98, 3, 6, 156174) One who purchases uncertified khadi is ignorant of the purpose of khadi, which was conceived as a simple means to remove the poverty of Daridranarayana, which alone can improve Indias economic condition and ultimately win freedom.
('81', 98, 3, 7, 156405) Therein lies the importance of khadi and if khadi has to play its role in removing the poverty of the millions it must be under the control of some organization or State authority.
('81', 98, 3, 8, 156586) Crores of spinners would be willing to spin for eight hours for a paltry pice for they must fill their bellies.
('81', 98, 3, 9, 156698) Khadi made from yarn spun by them may be called hand spun but by its use we certainly will not be serving Daridranarayana.
('81', 98, 3, 10, 156821) The Charkha Sangh has therefore at once increased the spinners wages and attempts are being made to improve the economic condition of other artisans.
('81', 98, 3, 11, 156971) Those who sell uncertified khadi are guilty of theft from khadi artisans.
('81', 98, 3, 12, 157045) To purchase such khadi is to acquire stolen property.
('81', 98, 3, 13, 157099) This is atrocious.
('81', 98, 3, 14, 157118) The Charkha Sangh therefore appeals to business people to take up some other trade instead of selling [uncertified] khadi.
('81', 98, 3, 15, 157241) The public should purchase khadi from khadi bhandars of the Charkha Sangh or its certified depots only.
('81', 98, 3, 16, 157345) I hope all khadi lovers will agree that khadi, be it dear or cheap, should be purchased only through the Charkha Sangh and such khadi alone should be recognized as khadi.

('81', 100, 1, 5, 159150) About Valji also it is difficult to judge.
('81', 100, 1, 6, 159193) He has got very much prejudiced.
('81', 100, 1, 7, 159226) I think he also will come round.
('81', 100, 1, 8, 159259) I understand about Lilavati.
('81', 100, 1, 9, 159288) When you have taken her case in hand, why need I worry about her?
('81', 100, 1, 10, 159354) I did not wish to worry you with her problem, though.
('81', 100, 1, 11, 159408) She is hard working and smart.

('81', 101, 2, 10, 160682) She can stay on freely if her health remains satisfactory.
('81', 101, 2, 11, 160741) If she suffers in health, we shall see.
('81', 101, 2, 12, 160781) It would be a matter of satisfaction to her that if she was here she could see you oftener.
('81', 101, 2, 13, 160873) Your dejection must go.
('81', 101, 2, 14, 160897) It should be remembered that there is no reason for it at all.

('81', 103, 12, 29, 164578) I am firmly of the view that the Congress should leave the Assembly.
('81', 103, 12, 30, 164647) Khan Bahadur also, if he is on the Congress side, should do the same.
('81', 103, 12, 31, 164717) The Congress in Sind helping the war effort while not doing so elsewhere would produceis producinga bad impression.

('81', 106, 3, 10, 168310) Is not khadi our dharma?
('81', 106, 3, 11, 168335) Dharma as such is difficult to follow.
('81', 106, 3, 12, 168374) Having said so much, I who am its pioneer cannot be credited with perfect tapascharya.
('81', 106, 3, 13, 168461) I am not sorry for it.
('81', 106, 3, 14, 168484) I have done my best.
('81', 106, 3, 15, 168505) But the non stop plying of the wheel that you suggest is no small matter.
('81', 106, 3, 16, 168579) There are such devotees, arent there?
('81', 106, 3, 17, 168617) Some day khadi is bound to become universal.
('81', 106, 3, 18, 168662) Now about Russia.
('81', 106, 3, 19, 168680) We can do nothing.
('81', 106, 3, 20, 168699) I do not find much difference between the three.
('81', 106, 3, 21, 168748) It is true that much has been done in Russia for the people.
('81', 106, 3, 22, 168809) The slaughter that is going on does not raise my hair.
('81', 106, 3, 23, 168864) The civil war mentioned in the Bhagawata may be imaginary, but in real life it is true.
('81', 106, 3, 24, 168952) When violence increases in the world internecine wars are bound to take place.
('81', 106, 3, 25, 169031) Out of this will non violence be born if there are some truly non violent people.
('81', 106, 3, 26, 169113) I believe we are such people.
('81', 106, 3, 27, 169143) I cannot say how ahimsa will be born.
('81', 106, 3, 28, 169181) This power is beyond description.
('81', 106, 3, 29, 169215) It can be seen only in its impact.
('81', 106, 3, 30, 169250) God alone regulates it.
('81', 106, 3, 31, 169274) My peace and my firmness are based on this faith: See what Russia has done.
('81', 106, 3, 32, 169350) Once it took help from Germany and now from England.
('81', 106, 3, 33, 169403) Who can say what Russia will do if she loses?
('81', 106, 3, 34, 169449) From the point of view of ahimsa today we can be no more but [mute] witnesses of this slaughter.
('81', 106, 3, 35, 169546) Yes, but when an occasion arises we should be ready for sacrifice.
('81', 106, 3, 36, 169613) Kishorelalbhai will write something on non violent exercise.

('81', 107, 1, 16, 170638) To Allah Bux I said he should give up the Ministry if he had to live on Congress support.
('81', 107, 1, 17, 170728) But that he should do if he could convince Maulana of the truth of the position.
('81', 107, 1, 18, 170809) He said he had seen my viewpoint.
('81', 107, 1, 19, 170843) Let us see.

('81', 109, 5, 8, 173161) How can you have a bad throat ?
('81', 109, 5, 9, 173193) Surely you remember the English saying : Physician, heal thyself !

('81', 113, 13, 23, 179642) KAKA, What you write is certainly worth thinking over.
('81', 113, 13, 24, 179697) I thought over it but finally came to the conclusion that Jamnalaljis ability could fully develop only in goseva 1 work.
('81', 113, 13, 25, 179818) Though we have a Goseva Sangh, the work remains neglected.
('81', 113, 13, 26, 179877) We have been able to get neither experts nor money.
('81', 113, 13, 27, 179929) We have only been able to prepare the ground.
('81', 113, 13, 28, 179975) The work can be done, however, only if an experienced man dedicates himself to it.
('81', 113, 13, 29, 180058) Harijan work has got going and is getting on the rails.
('81', 113, 13, 30, 180114) What is being done is necessary.
('81', 113, 13, 31, 180147) Ultimately it is the awakening among Harijans themselves that will solve the problem.
('81', 113, 13, 32, 180233) Work is being done among sanatanists also, though it is true that no publicity is being given to it.

('81', 114, 1, 3, 180516) Finally, when you read the accompanying letter 1, the position will be clearer to you.
('81', 114, 1, 4, 180603) Return the letter.
('81', 114, 1, 5, 180622) There is one special reason also.
('81', 114, 1, 6, 180656) J[amnalalji] wants to cultivate greater purity.
('81', 114, 1, 7, 180704) He craves for purity of mind.
('81', 114, 1, 8, 180734) Service of the cow might satisfy his craving, for the cow is more mute than even the Harijans.
('81', 114, 1, 9, 180829) If we do not look after her, she will not rebel, but die.
('81', 114, 1, 10, 180887) Harijans, on the other hand, are being taught by us to rebel.
('81', 114, 1, 11, 180949) If we dont teach them, others are eager to do so.
('81', 114, 1, 12, 180999) In the Bharatiya Parishad 2, I think Abdul Haq Saheb had proposed a resolution to the effect that Hindi Urdu should be adopted in place of Hindi Hindustani.

('81', 114, 6, 17, 181288) September 23, 1941
('81', 114, 7, 18, 181307) BHAI VITHALDAS, I had meant to write to you when I saw your English letter to Jajuji, but I could not manage it.
('81', 114, 7, 19, 181420) I have now your Gujarati letter.
('81', 114, 7, 20, 181453) Why did you write in English?
('81', 114, 7, 21, 181483) We can never pour out our hearts in English.
('81', 114, 7, 22, 181528) A man like Jawaharlal may be able to do that for he has studied English since his childhood, and he learnt it in England.
('81', 114, 7, 23, 181650) But let that be.
('81', 114, 7, 24, 181667) There is some error in your reasoning.
('81', 114, 7, 25, 181706) If we wish to open small stores everywhere, we shall necessarily have to entrust each store to one man only.
('81', 114, 7, 26, 181815) We cannot employ another man to help him.
('81', 114, 7, 27, 181857) You do not seem to have any experience of village stores.
('81', 114, 7, 28, 181915) Poor village store keepers, how can they afford assistants?
('81', 114, 7, 29, 181975) If the man leaves his store, he will shut the door and lock it up, and then go out.
('81', 114, 7, 30, 182059) If he has a son, he might perhaps leave it in his charge.
('81', 114, 7, 31, 182117) In South Africa thousands of stores are run by our people and by Jews, and they are, each of them, in charge of one person only.
('81', 114, 7, 32, 182246) It would not be paying to have more than one person.
('81', 114, 7, 33, 182299) And in most cases the person lives just behind the store itself.
('81', 114, 7, 34, 182364) If he has to leave the store for any reason, he will shut the door and go out.
('81', 114, 7, 35, 182443) The store has stocks hardly worth Rs. 500. How can the man, then, afford an assistant?

('81', 115, 1, 2, 182649) dreaming of ushering in a new age, the age of ahimsa.
('81', 115, 1, 3, 182703) We should keep our stores open only for reasonable periods, not from six in the morning till twelve at night.
('81', 115, 1, 4, 182813) In England the stores are closed at fixed hours by law.
('81', 115, 1, 5, 182869) We should follow that practice voluntarily.
('81', 115, 1, 6, 182913) The English in India do so.
('81', 115, 1, 7, 182941) But irrespective of their practice, we should arrange our affairs on the basis of the law of ahimsa.
('81', 115, 1, 8, 183042) We should, therefore, plan the whole thing from that point of view.
('81', 115, 1, 9, 183110) I believe that we should give thought to the question of location, too.
('81', 115, 1, 10, 183182) I agree with your view that the science of sales is different from that of production.
('81', 115, 1, 11, 183269) And as the science of khadi production is different from the science of production of other goods, so also is the science of khadi sales different from the science of selling of other goods.
('81', 115, 1, 12, 183460) We have always postponed thinking about this matter.
('81', 115, 1, 13, 183513) The little thought we have occasionally given to the matter is not enough.
('81', 115, 1, 14, 183588) Morning is when we wake up.
('81', 115, 1, 15, 183616) I have now been making the khadi world think about this matter.
('81', 115, 1, 16, 183680) Our work is not being controlled by one man, but we have still not been fully organized as an institution either.
('81', 115, 1, 17, 183794) The reason is that we have not trained the requisite number of workers.
('81', 115, 1, 18, 183866) We started no school for them.
('81', 115, 1, 19, 183897) Now we have started one 1. Let us see how it fares.
('81', 115, 1, 20, 183949) The implication of your English letter was that the question should be considered by the Council.
('81', 115, 1, 21, 184047) I think that the time for that has not yet come.
('81', 115, 1, 22, 184096) First, Jajuji, you and I should think about it.
('81', 115, 1, 23, 184144) Finally, of course, the Council will have to consider the matter.
('81', 115, 1, 24, 184210) The objection you took in your English letter to Jajuji expressing his views seemed altogether improper to me.
('81', 115, 1, 25, 184321) If a secretary does his duty cons cientiously, he must guide the others.
('81', 115, 1, 26, 184394) That you did not approve of his suggestions was a different matter.
('81', 115, 1, 27, 184462) But so long as we accept a man as secretary, he is bound to guide us.

('81', 119, 12, 21, 189644) You also should keep an open mind.

('81', 119, 12, 23, 189728) You should not be scared of what Saksena writes.

('81', 120, 2, 5, 190353) But neither you nor anyone else can do anything about it.
('81', 120, 2, 6, 190411) It must be as God wills.
('81', 120, 2, 7, 190436) Annapurna has also been a burden to some extent.
('81', 120, 2, 8, 190485) I had thought that she would not get any fever there.

('81', 120, 2, 13, 190746) Mother herself is so considerate that she will not be a burden to me.
('81', 120, 2, 14, 190816) However, we shall do as you wish.
('81', 120, 2, 15, 190850) I shall not insist in any way.

('81', 121, 10, 19, 192453) I know how difficult it all is.
('81', 121, 10, 20, 192485) His death would certainly be a deliverance for him and to you all who are helpless witnesses to the tortures he is suffering.
('81', 121, 10, 21, 192611) Though the post leaves here daily at the appointed time evidently you receive two at a time.

('81', 122, 5, 8, 193123) SEVAGRAM, September 25, 1941
('81', 122, 6, 9, 193152) BHAI VALLABHBHAI, Nanibehn Jhaveri has passed away.
('81', 122, 6, 10, 193204) This seems incredible, but it is one of those acts of God which nobody can comprehend.
('81', 122, 6, 11, 193291) I understand about Allah Bux.
('81', 122, 6, 12, 193321) I have of course told him that we will accept Maulanas decision.
('81', 122, 6, 13, 193386) But I have also told him at the same time that, if he is convinced of the necessity of leaving, he should convince Maulana also and, resigning his office, go into the wilderness with the Congress.
('81', 122, 6, 14, 193583) There is no breach of promise or anything like that in this.
('81', 122, 6, 15, 193644) But let us leave it alone.
('81', 122, 6, 16, 193671) When you come, we shall have a brief discussion about the pros and cons of the suggestion.
('81', 122, 6, 17, 193762) My view regarding Sind is not new.
('81', 122, 6, 18, 193797) But the old view has grown stronger and I hold it to be applicable to all provinces.
('81', 122, 6, 19, 193882) I am in no hurry.
('81', 122, 6, 20, 193900) The suggestion can be acted upon only if most of us accept it.
('81', 122, 6, 21, 193963) Most includes Maulana also.
('81', 122, 6, 22, 193991) Do give, within reasonable limits, the time required by homoeopathy to cure you.
('81', 122, 6, 23, 194072) I have heard much about the water at Hajira, but do not know about Deolali.
('81', 122, 6, 24, 194148) Hajira may possibly agree with you.
('81', 122, 6, 25, 194184) Everything else failing, you can try nature cure.
('81', 122, 6, 26, 194234) But we should first meet and have a brief discussion.
('81', 122, 6, 27, 194288) The little girls illness is getting prolonged.
('81', 122, 6, 28, 194335) It seems from Manibehns letter that she may even survive.
('81', 122, 6, 29, 194393) Rajendra Babu is all right.
('81', 122, 6, 30, 194421) Jamnalaljis problem cannot still be said to have been solved.
('81', 122, 6, 31, 194483) I hope Bhulabhai will get well.

('81', 123, 4, 11, 195022) The patients are all fine.
('81', 123, 4, 12, 195049) The right treatment for Chakrayya still eludes us.
('81', 123, 4, 13, 195100) Prabhakars case is peculiar.
('81', 123, 4, 14, 195129) He is not having fever.
('81', 123, 4, 15, 195153) He does not suffer from itch because he is not being given food.
('81', 123, 4, 16, 195218) However, he continues to be troubled by sexual craving, and has discharges frequently.
('81', 123, 4, 17, 195305) If you can think of a cause for this, let me know.
('81', 123, 4, 18, 195356) You must have adjusted your routine for studying.
('81', 123, 4, 19, 195406) After visiting Bombay it somehow seems that this time I met no one of importance there.

('81', 127, 2, 7, 200199) As for Annapurna, I suggest that you should keep her on a light diet.
('81', 127, 2, 8, 200269) If T.B. is not suspected then her fever may come down by a diet of milk, fruit and leafy vegetables.
('81', 127, 2, 9, 200370) But this is the suggestion of a quack.

('81', 127, 7, 24, 201036) At the same time my opinion is that our curriculum should be such that the boys who reach the high school stage should have gained adequate knowledge which would enable them to find occupations or jobs when they leave school.

('81', 130, 3, 4, 204054) MAGANLAL, I learnt, by chance, only the day before yesterday about your having failed.
('81', 130, 3, 5, 204141) You have not failed only in one subject.
('81', 130, 3, 6, 204182) This indicates that you lack aptitude for law.
('81', 130, 3, 7, 204229) This is true of many people.
('81', 130, 3, 8, 204258) There have been great men who were deficient in certain capacities.
('81', 130, 3, 9, 204326) Everybody cannot be a mathematician.
('81', 130, 3, 10, 204363) One should follow the path indicated by ones gifts.
('81', 130, 3, 11, 204415) I would, therefore, urge you to give up your ambition of passing the examination and to devote yourself exclusively to your business.
('81', 130, 3, 12, 204549) Whatever little knowledge of law you have acquired will remain with you.
('81', 130, 3, 13, 204622) I do wish, of course, that you should improve your English.
('81', 130, 3, 14, 204682) But if you are disinclined to that labour, I will not insist on that either.
('81', 130, 3, 15, 204759) I should also like you to be tested thoroughly by an able professor and you should then agree to learn whatever subject he finds you have an aptitude for.
('81', 130, 3, 16, 204914) I wish, too, that you should come here as early as possible and take the children to Rangoon.
('81', 130, 3, 17, 205008) Urmi is pining for Rangoon all the time.

('81', 133, 9, 14, 209654) Those who wish to travel should have as little luggage as possible and I want to get rid of my superfluous baggage.

('81', 135, 9, 34, 212410) In this business of khadi, as in any other, I know that we sell on credit to increase the sales but ultimately suffer losses.
('81', 135, 9, 35, 212536) While I was practising law in South Africa I used to examine the accounts of hundreds of businessmen who were my clients.
('81', 135, 9, 36, 212658) They used to provide 25 per cent for bad debts.
('81', 135, 9, 37, 212706) As a result they would charge a very high rate of profit.
('81', 135, 9, 38, 212764) Some of them would go bankrupt.
('81', 135, 9, 39, 212796) My experience of conducting Indian Opinion, Navajivan, Young India and Harijan has shown me that we escaped losses because we never sold on credit.
('81', 136, 0, 1, 212944) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 137
('81', 136, 1, 2, 212991) did this policy adversely affect the number of our subscribers.
('81', 136, 1, 3, 213055) One direct benefit of this policy was that only those subscribed to these periodicals who cared for them.
('81', 136, 1, 4, 213161) There can however be no comparison between khadi and other kinds of business.
('81', 136, 1, 5, 213239) Khadi is an altruistic affair.
('81', 136, 1, 6, 213270) It is conceived as service to the starving millions.
('81', 136, 1, 7, 213323) Then why should we sell khadi on credit?
('81', 136, 1, 8, 213364) My personal conviction therefore is that under no circumstances and to no person should we sell khadi on credit.
('81', 136, 1, 9, 213477) If we firmly followed this policy we shall spare ourselves much unnecessary expenditure and can even bring down the price of khadi.
('81', 136, 1, 10, 213609) And simultaneously we shall be able to give our customers satisfaction.
('81', 136, 1, 11, 213681) It is a general rule of the Charkha Sangh that no bhandar under its jurisdiction shall release goods on credit.
('81', 136, 1, 12, 213793) I am afraid everyone has not been able to observe this rule hundred per cent.
('81', 136, 1, 13, 213871) I submit that mere enunciation of a rule whose importance we cannot appreciate is not much good.
('81', 136, 1, 14, 213968) I hope, therefore, that all khadi workers will clearly understand the policy of not giving credit and then follow it unfailingly.

('81', 136, 3, 28, 214641) So, I decided on tomorrow.

('81', 137, 3, 8, 215162) We must put up with it.

('81', 137, 3, 10, 215239) Perhaps you forgot to send them.
('81', 137, 3, 11, 215272) Be that as it may, my opinion about that Jail is the same as about other jails.
('81', 137, 3, 12, 215352) Hunger strikes are permissible only when self respect is at stake.
('81', 137, 3, 13, 215419) This can be minimized by keeping the movement pure.
('81', 137, 3, 14, 215471) We must understand the limitations of hunger strike.
('81', 137, 3, 15, 215524) After a few other prisoners are released I shall certainly send for them.

('81', 137, 12, 28, 216022) NALWADI, September 30, 1941 You should adopt a simple and brief constitution without provision for so many categories of members.
('81', 137, 12, 29, 216152) All the members should be of one category and there should be no patrons at all.
('81', 137, 12, 30, 216233) Those who contribute will do so not for the sake of name.
('81', 137, 12, 31, 216291) Some of them may contribute anonymously and may not even like to disclose their names.
('81', 138, 0, 1, 216378) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 139
('81', 138, 1, 2, 216425) You dont stand to gain by having various categories of membership.
('81', 138, 1, 3, 216492) The members are not going to have any privileges.
('81', 138, 1, 4, 216542) Our purpose is to render service, not to enjoy privileges.
('81', 138, 1, 5, 216601) Even ten or twenty members capable of rendering concrete service would suffice.
('81', 138, 1, 6, 216681) Every member must be bound by the condition to use only cows milk, ghee, etc., and leather made from dead cattle.
('81', 138, 1, 7, 216795) In this no laxity should be permitted.
('81', 138, 1, 8, 216834) A small committee to carry on the work of the society may be formed.
('81', 138, 1, 9, 216903) I formed the opinion, even while in South Africa, that we would have to give up the lure of buffalos milk and ghee.
('81', 138, 1, 10, 217019) Cow protection helps protection of the buffalo also.
('81', 138, 1, 11, 217072) It cannot be that everybody would give up buffalos milk but there is real danger of people giving up cows milk.
('81', 138, 1, 12, 217184) If, therefore, we do not protect the cow, both the buffalo and the cow are sure to be doomed.
('81', 138, 1, 13, 217278) Our fault isthis is a fault found in all men, but more particularly among Indiansthat we grab what is easily available and we let go what is difficult to obtain.
('81', 138, 1, 14, 217440) People find khadi, village industries organization and the like inexpensive and convenient.
('81', 138, 1, 15, 217532) They prefer buffalo milk because it is sweet and cheap.
('81', 138, 1, 16, 217588) Since the times of the Vedas we have been glorifying the cow not the buffalo.
('81', 138, 1, 17, 217666) Had the cow not been so glorified, it would have perished and along with it the buffalo.
('81', 138, 1, 18, 217755) I have studied the comparative figures of the cows and buffaloes in India.
('81', 138, 1, 19, 217830) Both are in plenty but neither of them is making any progress.
('81', 138, 1, 20, 217893) So long as it pays him, the milkman keeps the cow or the buffalo after which he sells them to the butcher.
('81', 138, 1, 21, 218000) The butcher utilizes the proceeds for purchasing more cattle.
('81', 138, 1, 22, 218062) The cow protectionwallahs purchase these cows or buffaloes in order to save them from the butchers knife.
('81', 138, 1, 23, 218168) A couple of cows are saved in this manner but it spells disaster for the cow in general.
('81', 138, 1, 24, 218257) The correct remedy, therefore, lies in forgetting the cow already sold and in investing funds for improving the breed, raising its value and in teaching cattle keepers their dharma.
('81', 138, 1, 25, 218439) Let no one fear that the buffalo will become extinct if all give up its milk and ghee.
('81', 138, 1, 26, 218526) As I have already told you this will hardly happen and even if it did there would be no harm.
('81', 138, 1, 27, 218620) The buffalo will return to the jungle.
('81', 138, 1, 28, 218659) What we must protect is the cow and, because the milk of both is useful, the buffalo will also be saved along with the cow.
('81', 138, 1, 29, 218783) But if instead of following the scientific method everybody, in the name of cow protection, sets about acting according to his own fancy, both the cow and the buffalo are sure to he doomed.
('81', 138, 1, 30, 218973) It was mainly owing to our ignorance that so many other things in our country similarly met their doom.
('81', 138, 1, 31, 219077) We can realize our duty towards the
('81', 139, 0, 1, 219113) 140 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 139, 1, 2, 219155) animal world and discharge it by wisely pursuing our dharma of service to the cow.
('81', 139, 1, 3, 219238) At the root of cow protection is the realization of our dharma towards the sub human species.
('81', 139, 1, 4, 219332) But our service to the cow is service only in name and all of us are therefore tending to forget our dharma.
('81', 139, 1, 5, 219441) Statistically speaking, India has one fourth of the worlds cattle population.
('81', 139, 1, 6, 219519) But the plight of our cattle is worse than that of the human population, bad as it is.
('81', 139, 1, 7, 219606) One who serves the cow must take cows milk only and not goats milk.
('81', 139, 1, 8, 219674) I take goats milk out of my helplessness.
('81', 139, 1, 9, 219716) But the members of the Cow protection Society must take only cows milk and ghee and use only leather made from dead cows and buffaloes.
('81', 139, 1, 10, 219852) Where even cows and buffaloes are being slaughtered, how can one get leather made from dead goats?
('81', 139, 1, 11, 219951) Mankind has till this day taken it for granted that the goat is born only to be butchered.
('81', 139, 1, 12, 220042) Today being Dussehra, in Calcutta thousands of goats must have been sacrificed to Goddess Kali.
('81', 139, 1, 13, 220138) Ghee should not present any problem for the rich.
('81', 139, 1, 14, 220188) Just as they carry with them some lavender, Eau de Cologne and a toothbrush, similarly they should also have cows ghee or else they should not think of cow protection.
('81', 139, 1, 15, 220356) The problem of milk is not as simple as that of ghee.
('81', 139, 1, 16, 220410) In Almora cows milk is not available at any cost.
('81', 139, 1, 17, 220460) The same condition prevails in Orissa.
('81', 139, 1, 18, 220499) We can make milk by dissolving mava 1 in water.
('81', 139, 1, 19, 220547) We use Horlicks powder because it is a good thing and easily digestible.
('81', 139, 1, 20, 220620) But why should we not make a similar powder here?
('81', 139, 1, 21, 220670) We should acquire the scientific knowledge and make it locally so that powder milk could be available even at the top of the Himalayas.
('81', 139, 1, 22, 220806) Jamnalals health is not so good that he can be allowed to go to jail again.
('81', 139, 1, 23, 220882) If he falls ill after going there I shall not be able to bear it.
('81', 139, 1, 24, 220948) This struggle is going to be a prolonged one.
('81', 139, 1, 25, 220994) When the time comes I shall myself ask him to leave everything and go to jail.
('81', 139, 1, 26, 221073) But today it is my duty not to send him to jail.
('81', 139, 1, 27, 221122) What should be his field of activity then?
('81', 139, 1, 28, 221165) He placed before me a few suggestions such as Harijan [work], khadi, cow protection, etc.
('81', 139, 1, 29, 221255) Of them I liked cow protection.
('81', 139, 1, 30, 221287) He was associated with this work from its inception and whatever work has so far been done has not been wasted.
('81', 139, 1, 31, 221399) It was by and large being conducted according to my own understanding and advice.
('81', 139, 1, 32, 221481) Now it will be run under Jamnalaljis guidance.
('81', 139, 1, 33, 221528) Cow protection is service to the dumb creation.
('81', 139, 1, 34, 221576) Today Harijans are weak but tomorrow they can become strong and make progress on

('81', 140, 1, 3, 221785) If tomorrow Harijans rise and take possession of temples, I shall dance [for joy].
('81', 140, 1, 4, 221868) But the cow has no such strength.
('81', 140, 1, 5, 221902) She can be strong and healthy only if we feed her.
('81', 140, 1, 6, 221953) She will always be a docile animal.
('81', 140, 1, 7, 221989) You may hit or even kill her, but she cannot revolt against you.
('81', 140, 1, 8, 222054) Who is then going to protect her?
('81', 140, 1, 9, 222088) Jamnalals spiritual craving will be satisfied by serving the cow.
('81', 140, 1, 10, 222154) I have, therefore, entrusted this work entirely to him and he will run it with his business instinct as well as his altruistic disposition.
('81', 140, 1, 11, 222294) Cow protection is a stupendous task.
('81', 140, 1, 12, 222331) We will have to study this science in a dispassionate manner.
('81', 140, 1, 13, 222393) We must bring together all those who have studied this subject from the modern scientific angle.
('81', 140, 1, 14, 222490) We should have a band of efficient gosevaks who can go where demanded.
('81', 140, 1, 15, 222561) If Swami Ananda wishes to come he may, though he can carry on the work in Thana itself.
('81', 140, 1, 16, 222649) He should decide about the area of his activity and concentrate his energy there.
('81', 140, 1, 17, 222731) In this way, let us take the map of India and divide it into ten or hundred divisions.
('81', 140, 1, 18, 222818) The person in charge of each division will send in his report.
('81', 140, 1, 19, 222881) There are a number of goshalas in India which should be inspected and run on proper lines.
('81', 140, 1, 20, 222972) If an expert is required anywhere we should be in a position to send one.
('81', 140, 1, 21, 223046) It requires a man of purity to become a servant of the cow.
('81', 140, 1, 22, 223106) A person of ability alone will not do.
('81', 140, 1, 23, 223145) I see no need of touring at present for this work.
('81', 140, 1, 24, 223196) It should be possible to do a lot of work while stationed at one place.
('81', 140, 1, 25, 223268) To begin with, from now on we can supply cows milk in Wardha itself to those who are prepared to use it.

('81', 140, 4, 32, 223561) But the post here is a curious thing.
('81', 140, 4, 33, 223599) These are the drawbacks of village life.
('81', 140, 4, 34, 223640) I revel in them.

('81', 141, 1, 9, 224335) I have not given away your pen for good.

('81', 141, 1, 11, 224473) But for the moment I had no other.

('81', 143, 8, 12, 227109) It was a beautiful sight.
('81', 143, 8, 13, 227135) All of us went up to the outskirts of Sevagram.
('81', 143, 8, 14, 227183) Even after that we continued to walk in procession.
('81', 143, 8, 15, 227235) The village people washed his feet at every step, did arati and thus the procession went on to Barbadi.

('81', 143, 12, 25, 227788) October 1, 1941 I hold strong and decided views on the relationship between the Princes and the people.
('81', 143, 12, 26, 227892) I am convinced that, in the new world order, which is bound to follow the insensate butchery, dignified by the name of war, the Princes will have place only if they become true servants of
('81', 144, 0, 1, 228081) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 145
('81', 144, 1, 2, 228128) the people, deriving their power not from the sword but from the love and consent of the people.
('81', 144, 1, 3, 228225) Such being my fixed view, I advise the people of the States to cultivate patience and prepare themselves for the responsibilities that will devolve on them, willy nilly, by assiduously doing mute constructive work.
('81', 144, 1, 4, 228440) This does not mean submission to active and acute tyranny, of which I have so many accounts coming to me.
('81', 144, 1, 5, 228546) This the victims must resist in the best manner they can.
('81', 144, 1, 6, 228604) The only best manner I know is the way of non violence, otherwise called conscious and deliberate self suffering.
('81', 144, 1, 7, 228718) But cases of individual torture and degradation have come under my notice.
('81', 144, 1, 8, 228793) If they are true and if the tortured persons do not know the way of non violence, they will resist the tortures with all the violence they can summon from within and die in the attempt to resist the torture and the degradation.
('81', 144, 1, 9, 229021) That violent resistance will almost count as non violence, even as the resistance of a mouse to a ferocious cat will count.
('81', 144, 1, 10, 229145) I have in mind an unarmed man under torture by an armed company of torturers.
('81', 144, 1, 11, 229223) No man, however weak in body, if he has the will to resist and the capacity to die bravely, need feel helpless against odds, however heavy.
('81', 144, 1, 12, 229363) I would like the Princes to accept my claims to be their true friend.
('81', 144, 1, 13, 229433) As such, I would like to tell them that the way to read the signs of the times is to realize the utter helplessness of the sword.
('81', 144, 1, 14, 229563) The Biblical saying is going to prove true sooner than we had expected: For all they that take the sword shall perish by the sword. The Hindu, 3 10 1941

('81', 146, 13, 28, 232529) It is with the censor.
('81', 146, 13, 29, 232552) Perhaps you may get it belatedly.
('81', 146, 13, 30, 232586) At present everything has become irregular.
('81', 146, 13, 31, 232630) Things will be more irregular still.
('81', 146, 13, 32, 232667) The surprising thing is that even this much order has been kept.

('81', 147, 6, 9, 233131) Today the Ashram is teeming with people.
('81', 147, 6, 10, 233172) They just keep coming.

('81', 147, 6, 15, 233321) Even if this building is handed over for the hospital, Mother can still stay in your room.
('81', 147, 6, 16, 233412) What does she herself desire ?
('81', 147, 6, 17, 233443) Is she willing to come ?
('81', 147, 6, 18, 233468) Is she enthusiastic ?
('81', 147, 6, 19, 233490) Discuss it with her and write to me.
('81', 147, 6, 20, 233527) In whatever is done, we have to think of what will be convenient to you and Mother.
('81', 147, 6, 21, 233611) What inconvenience can it cause me ?
('81', 147, 6, 22, 233648) If I think of all these people at the Ashram as an inconvenience, then Mother too would be an inconvenience.
('81', 147, 6, 23, 233757) Ultimately, she has to come here.
('81', 147, 6, 24, 233791) Hence, while taking a decision do not assume that she may be a burden to me.

('81', 147, 12, 33, 234089) Hitler too does not kill his own people.
('81', 147, 12, 34, 234130) This is ahimsa though in a very limited measure.
('81', 147, 12, 35, 234179) As ahimsa is the very nature of the atman, either man comes to it out of weariness or accepts it willingly, as we are trying to do.

('81', 149, 6, 12, 236026) October 2, 1941 However mean or insignificant the work may be, God values it more, provided it is done for service and without any hope of return.
('81', 149, 6, 13, 236173) Thus sweepers work is more valuable if it is done selflessly and with the motive of serving.
('81', 149, 7, 14, 236266) Gandhiji appealed to the audience to help in cow protection work, in preserving the cow which was now perishing due to neglect.
('81', 149, 7, 15, 236394) The evil, if not checked, would, he said, result in serious deterioration of the agricultural wealth of the country.
('81', 149, 8, 16, 236511) In conclusion, he appealed to them to develop charkha and spinning.
('81', 149, 8, 17, 236579) I do not value my Jayanti Day, but I call it Charkha Jayanti.
('81', 149, 9, 18, 236641) Gandhiji told the villagers that he would come every night amongst them for prayer, provided they liked it, as this would establish increased contact with them, but they must be punctual and regular.

('81', 150, 2, 3, 237436) SEVAGRAM, October 3, 1941 It is no pleasure for me to appear before this court for the third time except the natural pleasure one derives from the performance of ones duty.
('81', 150, 2, 4, 237609) But for the peremptory call of duty I should not have reappeared before this court.
('81', 150, 2, 5, 237693) Deep meditation for which jail life provides an ample opportunity has convinced me more than ever of the correctness of the Congress resolution to offer civil disobedience in vindication of the right of free speech to the extent of inviting those who listen to oppose the war in every shape or form.
('81', 150, 2, 6, 237993) The rivers of blood that are daily flowing in this war which is without parallel in barbarity and ferocity should convince even the confirmed sceptic of the utter immorality of the war.
('81', 150, 2, 7, 238179) Except for hypnotism which hardens even the sense of perception, there should not be any difficulty in preceiving the crime against humanity which the present war means.
('81', 150, 2, 8, 238349) It is difficult to strike the balance between the right and the wrong.
('81', 150, 2, 9, 238420) The right can only belong to the party that washes its hands clean of blood guiltiness and dares the aggressor by accepting the law of selfsuffering through non violent action to do his worst.
('81', 150, 2, 10, 238613) Though seemingly the Congress fight is in defence of the right to preach against association with all wars or at least this war, it is none the less an effort to convince the world of the immeasurable superiority of non violent action over the violent resistance even in a cause considered just.
('81', 150, 2, 11, 238909) Let no one attribute ineffectiveness to the studied mildness of the Congress action.
('81', 150, 2, 12, 238994) Actions appearing insignificant have led before now to astounding results.
('81', 150, 2, 13, 239069) Those of us who are privileged to take part in the struggle have a living faith that our civil disobedience will lead to a result fraught with the greatest benefit to mankind.

('81', 154, 2, 4, 243333) Pyarelal has written from prison.
('81', 154, 2, 5, 243367) I am sending you the letter.
('81', 154, 2, 6, 243396) I understand about Annapurna.
('81', 154, 2, 7, 243426) There is no need now to write to Rajkumari because she has now almost recovered.
('81', 154, 2, 8, 243507) And she has written that her brother would not let her go anywhere.
('81', 154, 2, 9, 243575) He insists that she should regain her health only at Simla.
('81', 154, 2, 10, 243635) I am enclosing a copy of Pyarelals statement.
('81', 154, 2, 11, 243681) The rest later.

('81', 154, 11, 32, 244370) I am considering what is possible.
('81', 154, 11, 33, 244405) I can only take what people give.
('81', 154, 11, 34, 244439) Chhotubhais suggestion cannot be worked.
('81', 154, 11, 35, 244480) We need no groups as suggested.

('81', 155, 8, 16, 245344) Again the pain.
('81', 155, 8, 17, 245360) I suppose it will come and go till at last it is itself exhausted in the effort, if we do not feed it.
('81', 155, 8, 18, 245463) That is natures way.
('81', 155, 8, 19, 245484) And you are following it, I am sure.
('81', 155, 8, 20, 245521) No fried chips or anything of the sort.
('81', 155, 8, 21, 245561) You did not tell me about this exposition of the Bible.
('81', 155, 8, 22, 245617) But having met ma[n]y Seventh day Adventists, I can understand his zeal.
('81', 155, 8, 23, 245690) We shall discuss the propriety of your joining the Goseva Sangh.

('81', 156, 3, 4, 245999) BHAI VALLABHBHAI, We shall meet soon now.
('81', 156, 3, 5, 246041) However, I wish to write about one thing.
('81', 156, 3, 6, 246083) Manibehn writes and tells me that .
('81', 156, 3, 7, 246119) 1 will appear for mill owners in a case against workers.
('81', 156, 3, 8, 246176) I cannot believe this.
('81', 156, 3, 9, 246199) But how can Mani make such a mistake?
('81', 156, 3, 10, 246237) At first, therefore, I thought of writing to.
('81', 156, 3, 11, 246283) 2 On second thoughts, however, I feel that there was no need for me to write while you were there.
('81', 156, 3, 12, 246382) You yourself can solve the problem.
('81', 156, 3, 13, 246418) If Mani is right, send for .
('81', 156, 3, 14, 246447) 3 and tell him that, if at all, he should appear on behalf of the workers.
('81', 156, 3, 15, 246522) He cannot appear on behalf of the mill owners under any circumstances.
('81', 156, 3, 16, 246593) The other point is that, so far as I understand, .
('81', 156, 3, 17, 246644) 4 was not to resume practice.
('81', 156, 3, 18, 246674) He has dedicated himself to national service.
('81', 156, 3, 19, 246720) He may accept a brief in special circumstances.
('81', 156, 3, 20, 246768) But if he starts practice like any other lawyer, his conduct would deserve the severest condemnation.
('81', 156, 3, 21, 246870) I am quite clear in my mind that he was not to resume practice.
('81', 156, 3, 22, 246934) He has left the Congress in order to clarify his position from a moral point of view.
('81', 156, 3, 23, 247020) But in all other respects he is a Congressman.
('81', 156, 3, 24, 247067) I had thought that by leaving the Congress he had, like me, become more of a Congressman.
('81', 156, 3, 25, 247157) He seemed frank and straightforward to me, is capable of responding to an appeal to the heart and of self sacrifice, and is a man ready to correct his error.
('81', 156, 3, 26, 247315) If you share this impression, send for him and explain this to him.
('81', 156, 3, 27, 247383) We should treat him as a Congressman for all practical purposes.
('81', 156, 3, 28, 247448) I suppose you know that Maulana wants .
('81', 156, 3, 29, 247488) to leave the Assembly.
('81', 156, 3, 30, 247511) I see no such need.
('81', 156, 3, 31, 247531) Rajendra Babu does not see any, nor does the Professor.
('81', 156, 3, 32, 247587) I think you also do not see any.
('81', 156, 3, 33, 247620) Am I right?

('81', 158, 11, 22, 250120) I had your previous letter too.
('81', 158, 11, 23, 250152) I thank you for both.
('81', 158, 11, 24, 250174) The copy of Polaks letter is important.
('81', 158, 11, 25, 250214) He has developed of late a strange attitude on Indian affairs.
('81', 158, 11, 26, 250277) It is not less unfortunate because it is sincerely held.
('81', 158, 11, 27, 250334) What he considers unreal is altogether real for us.
('81', 158, 11, 28, 250386) Pakistan may be unreal.
('81', 158, 11, 29, 250410) I hold it to be dangerous.
('81', 158, 11, 30, 250437) But it is too real to be dismissed with contempt.
('81', 158, 11, 31, 250487) C[ivil] D[isobedience] may be unreal.
('81', 158, 11, 32, 250525) But I should resent anybody calling it unreal.
('81', 158, 11, 33, 250572) Sir Tej Bahadurs wrath is not unreal.
('81', 158, 11, 34, 250610) It is symptomatic of the Indian temper.
('81', 158, 11, 35, 250650) I know nobody who considers this war to be Indias war.
('81', 158, 11, 36, 250705) The utter disregard of the sentiment of politically minded India is a dangerous reality.

('81', 159, 1, 4, 251040) They have no will but the British will, they have no status but what the British may give them from moment to moment.
('81', 159, 1, 5, 251158) To say that we must produce an agreement to which the Princes are party is as much as to say that the British should be party.

('81', 160, 2, 4, 252685) 1 My satisfaction was relevant because if he had been wrong, he would have been guilty of prevarication and I could not be quite the same to him as before.

('81', 164, 6, 12, 257432) CHAKRAYYA, It is sad that you had an attack of giddiness.
('81', 164, 6, 13, 257490) I think it was due to the weight on your mind.
('81', 164, 6, 14, 257537) So it is good that you wrote everything.
('81', 164, 6, 15, 257578) But there is no reason to be sorry about it.
('81', 164, 6, 16, 257623) The complaint about partiality is correct.
('81', 164, 6, 17, 257666) None else is at fault except Ba and myself.
('81', 164, 6, 18, 257710) Ba has not been able to give up [the feeling of] mine and thine, and I cannot leave Ba.
('81', 164, 6, 19, 257798) Hence the progress of the Ashram has stopped.
('81', 164, 6, 20, 257844) But there are many good qualities in Ba, which I cannot forget.
('81', 164, 6, 21, 257908) It is difficult to free oneself from mine and thine.
('81', 164, 6, 22, 257961) But the change that has taken place in Bas life is no small thing.
('81', 164, 6, 23, 258028) From where did Ba attain such purity?
('81', 164, 6, 24, 258066) Her simplicity, patience, etc., are qualities of a high order.
('81', 164, 6, 25, 258129) Hencc Bas partiality deserves to be tolerated.
('81', 164, 6, 26, 258176) There is no venom in her partiality.
('81', 164, 6, 27, 258213) You have been unfair to Krishnachandra and Shakaribehn.
('81', 164, 6, 28, 258269) Krishnachandra does nothing for his own sake.
('81', 164, 6, 29, 258315) He gave up his home, his studies, and he labours in the Ashram.
('81', 164, 6, 30, 258379) If he tried to save five annas, it was not for himself.
('81', 164, 6, 31, 258435) He will not be partial to anyone.
('81', 164, 6, 32, 258469) lt is a different matter if he is frightened and is exploited by someone.
('81', 164, 6, 33, 258543) So it is with Shakaribehn.
('81', 164, 6, 34, 258570) If I relieve her from work, she would stay away, and also like it.
('81', 164, 6, 35, 258637) She is like that.
('81', 164, 6, 36, 258655) You should understand that all of us in the Ashram are imperfect; even then we try to be good.
('81', 164, 6, 37, 258750) Your duty is to look at your own faults and be tolerant of others.
('81', 164, 6, 38, 258817) This rule is for us all.

('81', 167, 3, 11, 262595) Why should we not outdo him ?
('81', 167, 3, 12, 262625) How that can be done, God alone knows.
('81', 167, 3, 13, 262664) But he has shown us that we should be like him.
('81', 167, 3, 14, 262712) Taramati must be happy.
('81', 167, 3, 15, 262736) There is a telegram from Harkisan.
('81', 167, 3, 16, 262771) But I am not writing to him separately.
('81', 167, 3, 17, 262811) He has done creditable work as your nephew.
('81', 167, 3, 18, 262855) Because you gave me detailed information at once, I also caused a stir.

('81', 168, 1, 2, 263820) 320. SPEECH AT A. I. S. A. MEETING
('81', 168, 2, 3, 263855) WARDHA, October 7, 1941 Today I must speak on one or two fundamental questions.
('81', 168, 2, 4, 263935) You must all have read Pandit Jawaharlals letter in Khadi Jagat.
('81', 168, 2, 5, 264000) Jawaharlals language generally tends to be strong.
('81', 168, 2, 6, 264051) But I feel that this is a good letter.
('81', 168, 2, 7, 264090) We must pay attention to its purport.
('81', 168, 2, 8, 264128) He is discontented.
('81', 168, 2, 9, 264148) He asks why we have not been able to do more work.
('81', 168, 2, 10, 264199) He feels we have not given enough consideration to the matter.
('81', 168, 2, 11, 264262) I would not entirely agree.
('81', 168, 2, 12, 264290) We have been giving consideration to the matter from time to time and even today we are seized of it.
('81', 168, 2, 13, 264392) But I must admit our sadhana, our tapasya, has not been adequate.
('81', 168, 2, 14, 264458) This is the point made by Jawaharlal.
('81', 168, 2, 15, 264496) His very name evokes thoughts of awakening and inspiration.
('81', 168, 2, 16, 264556) Jawaharlal has always recognized the importance of khadi but after he went to jail he has come to feel more acutely on the subject.
('81', 168, 2, 17, 264688) We must give due thought to his letter.
('81', 168, 2, 18, 264728) The news coming in from all sides shows that the demand for khadi has sharply increased.
('81', 168, 2, 19, 264817) It has risen so much that we are not in a position to meet it.
('81', 168, 2, 20, 264880) The demand for charkhas too is so great that we can never cope with it!
('81', 168, 2, 21, 264952) What can we do?
('81', 168, 2, 22, 264968) In many places, the money value of the work, which was a few hundred rupees, is now a few thousand rupees.
('81', 168, 2, 23, 265075) You may have heard that in Ranchi, Bihar, while the sale of khadi at the last Jayanti was of the order of Rs. 600, it has now risen to Rs. 10,000. What I say is that we must go on producing as much khadi as we can.
('81', 168, 2, 24, 265290) We should not let ourselves be deterred by the fear that it might not be sold.
('81', 168, 2, 25, 265369) We must never allow ourselves to think for a moment that khadi cannot be sold.
('81', 168, 2, 26, 265448) Yes, we may not have enough capital to substantially increase the production of khadi.
('81', 168, 2, 27, 265535) In that case we should try to find the capital.
('81', 168, 2, 28, 265583) We must carefully consider what should be our technique of work.
('81', 168, 2, 29, 265648) Someone has written saying that a lot of yarn has piled up with him and asked how he is to get it woven.
('81', 168, 2, 30, 265753) We must have the resources to have such yarn woven or exchanged for khadi.
('81', 168, 2, 31, 265828) We must be able to accept all the yarn that comes and supply in exchange such khadi in such quantities as we can.
('81', 168, 2, 32, 265942) We must also so improve the quality of our yarn that even the least efficient weavers may be able to weave it.
('81', 168, 2, 33, 266053) It is said that we cannot spin any yarn of the strength of mill yarn.
('81', 168, 2, 34, 266123) This is to some extent true.
('81', 168, 2, 35, 266152) But this does not satisfy me.
('81', 168, 2, 36, 266182) May be we cannot compete with mills in the quality of the yarn.
('81', 168, 2, 37, 266246) Even so the difference should not be too great
('81', 169, 0, 1, 266293) 170 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 169, 1, 2, 266335) and it should gradually diminish.
('81', 169, 1, 3, 266369) Today our yarn leaves much room for improvement.
('81', 169, 1, 4, 266418) We have not made the progress that is desired in this field.
('81', 169, 1, 5, 266479) There is much work that we have to do.
('81', 169, 1, 6, 266518) We must discover and show to the people ways of producing good and strong yarn.
('81', 169, 1, 7, 266598) A lot of research into the subject is needed.
('81', 169, 1, 8, 266644) We have not paid sufficient attention to the matter.
('81', 169, 1, 9, 266697) We have been slack.
('81', 169, 1, 10, 266717) We must decentralize our work.
('81', 169, 1, 11, 266748) Yarn should be woven where it is spun.
('81', 169, 1, 12, 266787) We have been able to do so much since middle class people took to spinning Now if they will also take up weaving we can rally the weavers round us and take them forward.
('81', 169, 1, 13, 266957) We should make efforts in this direction also.
('81', 169, 1, 14, 267004) The demand for charkhas is on the increase everywhere.
('81', 169, 1, 15, 267059) This too shows that more and more people are taking to spinning.
('81', 169, 1, 16, 267124) For myself I have decided that we cannot send charkhas to every place from outside.
('81', 169, 1, 17, 267208) They should be manufactured locally.
('81', 169, 1, 18, 267245) I am beginning to think that dhanush takli alone can solve the problem.
('81', 169, 1, 19, 267317) It can be made everywhere.
('81', 169, 1, 20, 267344) The Yeravda charkha has its place and it will remain.
('81', 169, 1, 21, 267398) But it cannot be made everywhere.
('81', 169, 1, 22, 267432) It would be well if we could provide taklis to the millions.
('81', 169, 1, 23, 267493) But the plying of the takli calls for devoting special time, labour and attention.
('81', 169, 1, 24, 267576) It is also possible we may not be able to produce yarn in sufficient quantities on the takli.
('81', 169, 1, 25, 267670) It is not that with the dhanush takli as much yarn can be produced as with any other charkha.
('81', 169, 1, 26, 267764) It is easy to ply and easy to make.
('81', 169, 1, 27, 267800) It can be made even without the aid of a carpenter.
('81', 169, 1, 28, 267852) The making of the spindle for it may present some difficulty but not much.
('81', 169, 1, 29, 267927) For even if a spindle is a little crooked, it can serve in a dhanush takli.
('81', 169, 1, 30, 268003) We can make millions of dhanush taklis in a day.
('81', 169, 1, 31, 268052) I admit I will have a little difficulty in the beginning in making people interested in it even as I had in making them interested in khadi but it will soon be overcome.
('81', 169, 1, 32, 268222) We have to put a spur to the work of attaining self reliance in khadi.
('81', 169, 1, 33, 268293) This can be done only through the dhanush takli.
('81', 169, 1, 34, 268342) I cannot agree with the suggestion that charkhas should be manufactured in a few factories and then sent out to every place from there.
('81', 169, 1, 35, 268478) If we thus centralize the charkha it will be finished.
('81', 169, 1, 36, 268533) Everything connected with the charkha should be made where the spinning is done.
('81', 169, 1, 37, 268614) That is why I have suggested that every home should have a dhanush takli in it.
('81', 169, 1, 38, 268694) Till we have fully gone into the thing we should not indulge in a mere intellectual discussion of the problem.
('81', 169, 1, 39, 268805) Only he has a right to participate in any discussion on the matter who has plied a dhanush takli for nine hours every day for a month.
('81', 169, 1, 40, 268940) He will have a right to express a view.
('81', 169, 1, 41, 268980) I therefore suggest that you should give thought to the dhanush takli.
('81', 169, 1, 42, 269051) But not merely because I am advocating it.
('81', 169, 1, 43, 269094) If your experience refutes my point you should not go merely by
('81', 170, 0, 1, 269158) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 171
('81', 170, 1, 2, 269205) what I say.
('81', 170, 1, 3, 269217) I had spoken of giving spinners a daily wage of eight annas but so far we have not been able to go beyond three annas.
('81', 170, 1, 4, 269336) Supposing we were to have the same experience here?
('81', 170, 1, 5, 269388) This is a matter for research and experiment.
('81', 170, 1, 6, 269434) In the same way we have to think about the yarn.
('81', 170, 1, 7, 269483) We should think of developing the capacity to weave whatever yarn may come to us.
('81', 170, 1, 8, 269565) We must in any case accept the self sufficient yarn.
('81', 170, 1, 9, 269618) The people who bring the yarn should accept the price we can give for it.
('81', 170, 1, 10, 269692) Whether it is in the form of money or khadi we must not refuse to pay.
('81', 170, 1, 11, 269763) If we cannot arrange for yarn thus received to be woven, then we may say in Jawaharlals words that our creative faculties have become atrophied we have lost our ability to think.
('81', 170, 1, 12, 269942) This would be a defeatist attitude.
('81', 170, 1, 13, 269978) We do not want to accept defeat.
('81', 170, 1, 14, 270011) If we cannot take the weavers in our fold nothing will get done.
('81', 170, 1, 15, 270076) But we cannot go by mere faith.
('81', 170, 1, 16, 270108) Today they are using mill yarn.
('81', 170, 1, 17, 270140) We have to change this situation.
('81', 170, 1, 18, 270174) We have to give them handspun yarn.
('81', 170, 1, 19, 270210) My feeling is that the War is not going to end soon.
('81', 170, 1, 20, 270263) No import of cloth will he possible.
('81', 170, 1, 21, 270300) Prices of textiles will also rise.
('81', 170, 1, 22, 270335) Only Indian mills will be manufacturing cloth for use in India.
('81', 170, 1, 23, 270399) A time may come when they will not be able to supply all our requirement.
('81', 170, 1, 24, 270473) Cloth in India will then become scarce.
('81', 170, 1, 25, 270513) In China too such a situation had arisen.
('81', 170, 1, 26, 270555) But the Chinese are a hard working people.
('81', 170, 1, 27, 270598) They started the charkha in every home and in their own way quickly solved the problem.
('81', 170, 1, 28, 270686) Our method will be a little different but the effort required will be as much or more.
('81', 170, 1, 29, 270773) A day may come when people will ask us for cloth.
('81', 170, 1, 30, 270823) It would be a disgrace to tell them that we could not supply it.
('81', 170, 1, 31, 270888) We shall also have to think about cotton.
('81', 170, 1, 32, 270930) It is my firm conviction that if we produce cotton in the manner it should be from the point of view of khadi we shall soon be free of the need for imports.
('81', 170, 1, 33, 271087) If we produce cotton to feed the mills this will not be possible.
('81', 170, 1, 34, 271153) I feel that the principle of producing cotton for mills is opposed to the principle of producing it for khadi.
('81', 170, 1, 35, 271264) The convenience of the mills requires that cotton should be intensively grown in a few areas.
('81', 170, 1, 36, 271358) Their aim will be to see that if cotton growing is too scattered it should be brought together and concentrated in one place.
('81', 170, 1, 37, 271484) But khadi requires that cotton should be grown in every village.
('81', 170, 1, 38, 271549) No village should have to depend on another village for its cotton requirement.
('81', 170, 1, 39, 271629) Khadi cannot afford transport of cotton from one village to another.
('81', 170, 1, 40, 271698) We must immediately pay attention to the question how we can make cotton row in every village.
('81', 170, 1, 41, 271793) Another matter has been placed before me for my consi deration.
('81', 170, 1, 42, 271857) Many of our khadi bhandars are very small.
('81', 170, 1, 43, 271900) The question is
('81', 171, 0, 1, 271916) 172 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 171, 1, 2, 271958) whether in the interest of economy it will not be better that each such bhandar should be looked after by no more than one person.
('81', 171, 1, 3, 272089) What we will have to consider in this connection is whether these bhandars are to remain open for a fixed time or as long as possible.
('81', 171, 1, 4, 272224) If we want to make our lives khadi based we shall have to devise certain rules as regards khadi bhandars.
('81', 171, 1, 5, 272330) The rules will be different for towns and villages.
('81', 171, 1, 6, 272382) For the towns I think we should follow the practice of English shopkeepers.
('81', 171, 1, 7, 272458) They open shops according to their convenience.
('81', 171, 1, 8, 272506) They keep them closed on Sundays.
('81', 171, 1, 9, 272540) They dont care about the customers.
('81', 171, 1, 10, 272576) Gradually the customers become used to it.
('81', 171, 1, 11, 272619) We also want to establish new habits.
('81', 171, 1, 12, 272657) We should also make certain rules and fix a time for the opening of shops.
('81', 171, 1, 13, 272732) The same consideration should apply to shops in rural areas.
('81', 171, 1, 14, 272793) In South Africa there is one shop for an area of thousands of bighas.
('81', 171, 1, 15, 272863) People come in mule carts to make their purchases.
('81', 171, 1, 16, 272914) Sometimes the shopkeeper is not there, since there only one person to look after the shop.
('81', 171, 1, 17, 273005) But people are used to it.
('81', 171, 1, 18, 273032) Similarly, it is not necessary for us to keep our bhandars open all the time.
('81', 171, 1, 19, 273110) But the matter needs to be considered.
('81', 171, 1, 20, 273149) Thus we shall have to give systematic thought to all these matters.
('81', 171, 1, 21, 273217) We want to make of khadi an integrated way of life.
('81', 171, 1, 22, 273269) We have to deal with artisans, spinners and weavers.
('81', 171, 1, 23, 273322) In the sphere of production our aim is to pay equal wages to all.
('81', 171, 1, 24, 273388) So far we have extorted forced labour from the spinners.
('81', 171, 1, 25, 273445) This doctrine of paying the lowest wage and taking maximum work for it has been taken from the Arthashastra of Kautilya.
('81', 171, 1, 26, 273566) We must change this doctrine for a new one.
('81', 171, 1, 27, 273610) We shall give the same wage to spinners as we give to weavers.
('81', 171, 1, 28, 273673) Those who produce cotton should also prosper.
('81', 171, 1, 29, 273719) And yet we want that the burden on the buyer should be light.
('81', 171, 1, 30, 273781) Thus we wish to create a socialist society.
('81', 171, 1, 31, 273825) The socialism that India can digest will be of this kind.
('81', 171, 1, 32, 273883) It will be the socialism of the poor, but of the well to do poor.
('81', 171, 1, 33, 273949) The ideal of khadi is thus the promotion of a wholly socialistic way of life.
('81', 171, 1, 34, 274027) In brief, we have to give thought to all the processes of khadi from the growing of cotton to the selling of cloth.
('81', 171, 1, 35, 274143) When we have thus succeeded in bringing about a self sufficient socialist polity we shall no more be at the mercy of foreign markets.
('81', 171, 1, 36, 274277) Our society will be like a self sufficient agriculturist.
('81', 171, 1, 37, 274335) To an agriculturist his land is his capital.
('81', 171, 1, 38, 274380) He eats what the land yields.
('81', 171, 1, 39, 274410) If some year there is a failure of crops he starves.
('81', 171, 1, 40, 274463) He does not beg and he does not plunder.
('81', 171, 1, 41, 274504) That is all I had to say.
('81', 171, 1, 42, 274530) We must pay special attention to
('81', 172, 0, 1, 274563) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 173
('81', 172, 1, 2, 274610) weaving.
('81', 172, 1, 3, 274619) I have always said that just as we insisted that we should be good carders we should also insist that we should become good weavers.

('81', 172, 4, 17, 275290) He must have informed you, too.

('81', 173, 7, 15, 276643) So your cough is persistent.
('81', 173, 7, 16, 276672) Poor Shummy.
('81', 173, 7, 17, 276685) I am almost sure that the cough is due to some error in diet.
('81', 173, 7, 18, 276747) Some grease, more starch, sour fruit, sloppy food, too much protein, both animal and vegetable, dal, spices ever so little, general indigestion.
('81', 173, 7, 19, 276892) These are the causes according to my belief.
('81', 173, 7, 20, 276937) Menkels manipulations are local.
('81', 173, 7, 21, 276970) They can never bring permanent cure unless your digestive apparatus is in order.
('81', 173, 7, 22, 277051) There is no moving out for me during this month.
('81', 173, 7, 23, 277100) Almost all dates are booked.
('81', 173, 7, 24, 277129) If Rajaji comes about 20th, it means four or five days conversations.

('81', 174, 10, 19, 278267) You are filled with anxiety about your studies.
('81', 174, 10, 20, 278315) Content yourself with as much as you can do.
('81', 174, 10, 21, 278360) Your aim is not to pass an examination but to enhance your knowledge.
('81', 174, 10, 22, 278430) Of course you have to appear for the examination but that should be when you feel fully confident.
('81', 174, 10, 23, 278529) Do not worry about the delay.
('81', 174, 10, 24, 278559) Let it take as long as it may.
('81', 174, 10, 25, 278590) Pyarelal had spoken to me about the idea of your staying in Lahore.
('81', 174, 10, 26, 278658) I had told him that I would keep myself ready to make the arrangements later.
('81', 174, 10, 27, 278736) I forgot to write to you about the matter.
('81', 174, 10, 28, 278779) I can make arrangements quickly if you will allow me to do so.

('81', 175, 1, 3, 279150) Why should it affect us whether somebody praises us or blames us ?
('81', 175, 1, 4, 279217) My teaching was only with regard to the duty of a satyagrahi.
('81', 175, 1, 5, 279279) A satyagrahi will not court imprisonment to forget his pain or to escape from it.
('81', 175, 1, 6, 279361) He will do so in the faith that to offer satyagraha is his duty.
('81', 175, 1, 7, 279426) As for A. S., I would only say that one should forget about her.
('81', 175, 1, 8, 279491) One should accept whatever services she offers, but not expect anything from her.
('81', 175, 1, 9, 279573) It seems Pyarelals statement has been well received.
('81', 175, 1, 10, 279626) It is brief but to the point.

('81', 176, 8, 22, 281971) Did you read my note 2?
('81', 176, 8, 23, 281995) If I was a grain merchant, should 1 refuse Government order for wheat for the army, or quinine, if I was a chemist?
('81', 176, 8, 24, 282111) Supposing I refused and somebody else bought from me and sold it to the Government, how do I get out of the responsibility?
('81', 176, 8, 25, 282235) War effort is made of sterner stuff.
('81', 176, 8, 26, 282272) If you do not understand this elementary proposition, you will when an attempt is made to impress my personal service or to impress my labour to manufacture ammunition.
('81', 176, 8, 27, 282441) You will then realize the fundamental distinction, if I have the courage to refuse obedience.

('81', 185, 12, 26, 294221) It is good that it has.
('81', 185, 12, 27, 294245) It is an auspicious augury that two crore eighty thousand yards of yarn and Rs. 12,000 have been collected from the

('81', 186, 1, 2, 294499) three divisions 1 of Central Provinces.
('81', 186, 1, 3, 294539) I have received two letters from Agra Jail also.
('81', 186, 1, 4, 294588) The prisoners there have spun a good deal of yarn.
('81', 186, 1, 5, 294639) They did not have all the facilities for spinning.
('81', 186, 1, 6, 294690) But after Dhirendra Majumdar had reached the Jail, how could he rest content without making everyone spin?
('81', 186, 1, 7, 294797) He is one of the pillars of the Charkha Sangh.
('81', 186, 1, 8, 294844) He was not expected to go to jail.
('81', 186, 1, 9, 294879) But the Government sometimes becomes over generous.
('81', 186, 1, 10, 294931) It picks up some people without any ostensible reason.
('81', 186, 1, 11, 294986) Shri Maithilisharanji is also there.
('81', 186, 1, 12, 295023) He too was arrested without any good reason.
('81', 186, 1, 13, 295068) He is a famous poet and he has sent me a poem also.
('81', 186, 1, 14, 295120) But today poetry does not flow from his pen; it flows from the yarn that he spins.
('81', 186, 1, 15, 295203) I have sent him today a short reply 2. In that letter, too, I have said that with every round of yarn he and his co prisoners have spun, they have brought swaraj so much the nearer.
('81', 186, 1, 16, 295385) What I wrote to the poet is not mere rhetoric.
('81', 186, 1, 17, 295432) I mean what I say.
('81', 186, 1, 18, 295451) According to my definition, there cannot be true swaraj as long as there is exploitation.
('81', 186, 1, 19, 295541) Mere change from British to Indian rule does not mean swaraj.
('81', 186, 1, 20, 295603) As long as one class dominates over another, as long as the poor remain poor or become poorer, there will be no swaraj.
('81', 186, 1, 21, 295723) In my swaraj the millions will live happily.
('81', 186, 1, 22, 295768) They will get good food, decent house and enough clothing.
('81', 186, 1, 23, 295827) By good food I do not mean that they will eat sweets.
('81', 186, 1, 24, 295881) But everyone must get pure milk, pure ghee and sufficient fruit and vegetables.
('81', 186, 1, 25, 295961) I know I am talking tall because the poor today do not even know what fruit is.
('81', 186, 1, 26, 296041) During the mango season, they get a few mangoes and during the guava season they have a few guavas.
('81', 186, 1, 27, 296141) They do not get any other fruit except these and a few other.
('81', 186, 1, 28, 296203) They do not get even clean and nutritious foodgrain.
('81', 186, 1, 29, 296256) They have to live on rotten rice, coarse grain and dirty salt.
('81', 186, 1, 30, 296319) I wish everyone gets what they call a balanced diet as also a clean and comfortable house.
('81', 186, 1, 31, 296410) This according to me is real freedom.
('81', 186, 1, 32, 296448) I have written those words to Maithilisharanji with this kind of freedom in view.
('81', 186, 1, 33, 296530) We have never produced as much yarn as we have produced this year.
('81', 186, 1, 34, 296597) The reports that I get from the prisons make me dance for joy.
('81', 186, 1, 35, 296660) Maithilisharanji writes to me that in the Agra Jail his Communist companions also join in spinning although they have no respect for my views.
('81', 186, 1, 36, 296803) No one compelled them.
('81', 186, 1, 37, 296826) They started spinning on their own.
('81', 186, 1, 38, 296862) This is the way of ahimsa.
('81', 186, 2, 39, 296889) 1 Nagpur, Berar and Mahakoshal 2 Vide the preceding item.
('81', 187, 0, 1, 296947) 188 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 187, 1, 2, 296989) I have also received reports from the Gujrat (Punjab) jail.
('81', 187, 1, 3, 297049) I am not suggesting that everyone spins.
('81', 187, 1, 4, 297090) I have the names of those too who are not spinning.
('81', 187, 1, 5, 297142) But those who spin are in a majority.
('81', 187, 1, 6, 297180) I become more hopeful when I see these facts.
('81', 187, 1, 7, 297226) I am an irrepressible optimist.
('81', 187, 1, 8, 297258) But even I did not entertain such high hopes.
('81', 187, 1, 9, 297304) The Congress Constitution does include the rule about khadi but till now the Congress Committee insisted on khadi only to conform to the rule.
('81', 187, 1, 10, 297447) On this occasion, I believe, the work has been done with an element of faith.
('81', 187, 1, 11, 297525) While I say all this, I am not so foolish as to believe that khadi is now on its feet.
('81', 187, 1, 12, 297612) Whatever has been achieved is sufficient to strengthen my hope and my faith.
('81', 187, 1, 13, 297689) But that is not enough for the growth of khadi.
('81', 187, 1, 14, 297737) These are good omens.
('81', 187, 1, 15, 297759) But they are not sufficient for the removal of poverty and unemployment.
('81', 187, 1, 16, 297832) These problems cannot be solved as long as crores of people do not wear khadi.
('81', 187, 1, 17, 297911) I have a dream that people will wear home spun khadi just as they eat home made food.
('81', 187, 1, 18, 297997) I am talking of these things because people continue to ask me one question.
('81', 187, 1, 19, 298074) Even today I have received a letter.
('81', 187, 1, 20, 298111) They all ask, What will be the outcome of this struggle?
('81', 187, 1, 21, 298168) It is very slow and has no effect on the Government.
('81', 187, 1, 22, 298221) The Government does not seem to care.
('81', 187, 1, 23, 298259) A large number of satyagrahis are wandering in the streets.
('81', 187, 1, 24, 298319) They are not even arrested.
('81', 187, 1, 25, 298347) How can such a struggle be effective? They may say what they like, but my feeling is that my fight is going on according to my plan.
('81', 187, 1, 26, 298480) I am satisfied with its momentum.
('81', 187, 1, 27, 298514) At present I do not want to increase it further.
('81', 187, 1, 28, 298563) This does not mean that it will never gain momentum.
('81', 187, 1, 29, 298616) When the occasion demands it will be accelerated.
('81', 187, 1, 30, 298666) But this is not the occasion for it.
('81', 187, 1, 31, 298703) Everything is good or bad in a particular context.
('81', 187, 1, 32, 298754) There are occasions when mere bread is very useful.
('81', 187, 1, 33, 298806) But when it is inopportune even jalebi 1 is harmful.
('81', 187, 1, 34, 298859) So when an opportune time comes, our fight will be intensified.
('81', 187, 1, 35, 298923) Some people expect a miracle this very day.
('81', 187, 1, 36, 298967) In ahimsa there is no scope for such sudden miracles.
('81', 187, 1, 37, 299021) Ahimsa does not admit of sudden spurts.
('81', 187, 1, 38, 299061) But those who will can always see the miracles of ahimsa.
('81', 187, 1, 39, 299119) We watch the sky every day but we see no miracles there.
('81', 187, 1, 40, 299176) But those who have an eye for it are spellbound by the spectacle.
('81', 187, 1, 41, 299242) They see new miracles every moment.
('81', 187, 1, 42, 299278) And the sky is only a small fragment of Divine Power.
('81', 187, 1, 43, 299332) That Divine Power is also the source of ahimsa which
('81', 187, 2, 44, 299385) 1 A sweetmeat
('81', 188, 0, 1, 299399) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 189
('81', 188, 1, 2, 299446) works according to the Divine Law.
('81', 188, 1, 3, 299481) That Law is so mysterious that even its miraculous effects do not appear to be such.
('81', 188, 1, 4, 299566) They look like a natural course of events.
('81', 188, 1, 5, 299609) Our non violent struggle will also evolve according to the same Law.
('81', 188, 1, 6, 299678) When independence comes through non violence it will blossom forth so naturally that we may never notice the miracle having taken place.
('81', 188, 1, 7, 299815) Some people say that this is the opportunity to pressurize the Government.
('81', 188, 1, 8, 299890) From this point of view, they say, my present struggle of ahimsa is entirely lifeless.
('81', 188, 1, 9, 299977) I want to point out to them that the contents of the Bombay Resolution 1 are not mere prattle nor were they intended to bluff the world.
('81', 188, 1, 10, 300114) The Congress is a responsible trustworthy organization.
('81', 188, 1, 11, 300170) Its resolutions are serious, sincere and without exaggeration.
('81', 188, 1, 12, 300233) The Bombay Resolution pins its faith on the policy of non violence.
('81', 188, 1, 13, 300301) It has a passage 2 which should keep Congressmen always alert and watchful.
('81', 188, 1, 14, 300377) When the policy of non violence has been so clearly stated in the Bombay Resolution, how can we say that Englands difficulty is our greatest opportunity?
('81', 188, 1, 15, 300531) How can the Congress say that we should give her one more blow when England is herself collapsing?
('81', 188, 1, 16, 300630) And who knows whether England is actually collapsing?
('81', 188, 1, 17, 300684) Outwardly of course it looks like that.
('81', 188, 1, 18, 300724) But I do not believe it.
('81', 188, 1, 19, 300749) Appearances are not always real.
('81', 188, 1, 20, 300782) During the Boer War also there was an occasion when it appeared that England was almost defeated but the situation took a sudden turn and she came out victorious.
('81', 188, 1, 21, 300945) Today also we do not know who is going to win.
('81', 188, 1, 22, 300992) We do not want any one party to be defeated.
('81', 188, 1, 23, 301037) We wish that all the warring parties should come to terms and live like brothers.
('81', 188, 1, 24, 301119) How can you expect me to say that either Germany or Russia or Britain and America should be defeated?
('81', 188, 1, 25, 301221) I would pray that no one is defeated and they all live like brothers.
('81', 188, 1, 26, 301291) Ahimsa dictates : Consider no one your enemy.
('81', 188, 1, 27, 301337) Love even him who considers you his enemy. How can we then think of taking advantage of Englands predicament?
('81', 188, 1, 28, 301447) You may say, Then we are sure to be destroyed.
('81', 188, 1, 29, 301494) We will suffer defeat at the hands of the British. This betrays lack of faith.
('81', 188, 2, 30, 301573) 1 Vide To Satyagrahis, 2 10 1940.
('81', 188, 3, 31, 301607) 2 Which reads : They can have no ill will against them (the Britishers), and the spirit of satyagraha forbids the Congress from doing anything with a view to embarass them.

('81', 189, 1, 2, 301822) follower of non violence suffers defeat at no ones hands.
('81', 189, 1, 3, 301880) I may repeat once again that defeat has no place in the dictionary of ahimsa.
('81', 189, 1, 4, 301958) Victory and defeat are the results of violent war.
('81', 189, 1, 5, 302009) In ahimsa there is only victory and nothing else.
('81', 189, 1, 6, 302059) At the moment I cannot tell you how our ahimsa is ultimately going to succeed.
('81', 189, 1, 7, 302138) Not to embarrass Britain does not mean that we should help them.
('81', 189, 1, 8, 302203) They are resorting to violent methods.
('81', 189, 1, 9, 302242) We have to stand firm on our principle of ahimsa.
('81', 189, 1, 10, 302292) This will no doubt create some difficulty for them.
('81', 189, 1, 11, 302344) But we cannot help it.
('81', 189, 1, 12, 302367) How can we give up a principle which is bound to lead to the welfare of the world including that of Britain?
('81', 189, 1, 13, 302476) But if we violate our principle, we shall be guilty of violence.
('81', 189, 1, 14, 302541) I wish you to keep this in mind.
('81', 189, 1, 15, 302574) People ask me, What will be the outcome of this satyagraha?
('81', 189, 1, 16, 302634) All types of people, good, bad and indifferent, have joined it.
('81', 189, 1, 17, 302698) Even cheats and rogues are courting arrest in the name of satyagraha. I know there is not a single province where undesirable men have not courted arrest.
('81', 189, 1, 18, 302853) But I also know that there is not a single province where people who measure up to my standards have not gone to jail.
('81', 189, 1, 19, 302972) That is why I have not launched a mass movement.
('81', 189, 1, 20, 303021) If I launch a mass movement, people may perhaps jump into it.
('81', 189, 1, 21, 303083) What will the British do in that case?
('81', 189, 1, 22, 303122) They will enact another Jallianwala Bagh.
('81', 189, 1, 23, 303164) I am not afraid of it, but I do not want to give them an opportunity to do so.
('81', 189, 1, 24, 303243) If we remain strictly non violent and then they force a Jallianwala upon us, I could not care less.
('81', 189, 1, 25, 303343) But I say once again that it will be a good omen for India if even a handful of men whom we know to be true remain steadfast to their pledge.
('81', 189, 1, 26, 303485) That will pave the way for an all out non violent struggle.
('81', 189, 1, 27, 303545) All this needs an element of honesty.
('81', 189, 1, 28, 303583) It is a primary condition.
('81', 189, 1, 29, 303610) Those Congressmen who have to faith in khadi, who decry untouchability in public but observe it in their homes, who, being Hindus, hate the Muslims, or who, being Muslims, hate the non Muslims, do not deserve to be satyagrahis.
('81', 189, 1, 30, 303838) Such persons cannot help our cause even by going to jail.
('81', 189, 1, 31, 303896) They are like thieves and dacoits who also go to jail.
('81', 189, 1, 32, 303951) They are not satyagrahis but only law breakers.
('81', 189, 1, 33, 303999) They cannot produce any wholesome results.
('81', 189, 1, 34, 304042) Why should they go to jail disrupting their homes and forgoing their income?
('81', 189, 1, 35, 304119) We wish that only a handful of satyagrahis should go to jail; but their conduct should be such as to produce a moral effect.

('81', 190, 1, 2, 304291) Civil disobedience is a powerful weapon.
('81', 190, 1, 3, 304332) But for employing it, we must fulfil the thirteen point constructive programme 1 which I have outlined.
('81', 190, 1, 4, 304436) Till then this weapon cannot be effective.
('81', 190, 1, 5, 304479) I know that the crores of people in India cannot court arrest.
('81', 190, 1, 6, 304542) Nor is that necessary.
('81', 190, 1, 7, 304565) But it is essential that crores of people should have faith in the constructive programme.
('81', 190, 1, 8, 304656) Khadi is the pivot of the constructive programme.
('81', 190, 1, 9, 304706) It is essential that crores of people should wear khadi; they should not wear foreign or mill made cloth and they should not observe any untouchability.
('81', 190, 1, 10, 304859) If they are not prepared to do even this, how can freedom be won through ahimsa?
('81', 190, 1, 11, 304940) What right do they have to desire freedom, who are not prepared to take even a little trouble?
('81', 190, 1, 12, 305035) If we wish to win swaraj through ahimsa, this is the only way.
('81', 190, 1, 13, 305098) If, however, we wish to use force, then Hitler would point the way.
('81', 190, 1, 14, 305166) There are only two courses openeither Hitlers, that is, the way of violence, or mine, that is, the way of non violence.
('81', 190, 1, 15, 305286) Hitlerism and Churchillism are in fact the same thing.
('81', 190, 1, 16, 305341) The difference of only one of degree.
('81', 190, 1, 17, 305379) By presenting this yarn and this money to me, you are telling me that you do not want to tread the path of violence.
('81', 190, 1, 18, 305496) It is my belief that a time will come when everyone in India will realize that the only correct course is to follow ahimsa.
('81', 190, 1, 19, 305620) The day is soon arriving for khadi when the entire country will be convinced that any cloth other than khadi must be discarded.
('81', 190, 1, 20, 305748) I shall utilize all the money I have received on the occasion of Khadi Jayanti for encouraging khadi.
('81', 190, 1, 21, 305850) People ask me, Why do you not ulitize this money for Congress work? In a way khadi work is also Congress work.
('81', 190, 1, 22, 305961) But it is only the parliamentary programme or the movement against the Government that people regard as Congress work.
('81', 190, 1, 23, 306080) This is a wrong notion.
('81', 190, 1, 24, 306104) This amount will be utilized only for khadi work.
('81', 190, 1, 25, 306154) It is to be considered how this money received from the three divisions of the Central Provinces is to be utilized for the purposes of khadi.
('81', 190, 1, 26, 306296) These three divisions may jointly or separately send schemes for their areas.
('81', 190, 1, 27, 306374) Jajuji 2 will welcome and give them due consideration.
('81', 190, 1, 28, 306429) If we do not accept these schemes, we shall give reasons for rejecting them.
('81', 190, 2, 29, 306506) Many people send yarn to me by post.
('81', 190, 2, 30, 306543) I do not understand why they do so.
('81', 190, 2, 31, 306579) The amount spent on postage is more than the value of the

('81', 191, 1, 2, 306756) I wish people would send me ready made khadi.
('81', 191, 1, 3, 306802) Even from the jail they should send khadi woven out of yarn spun by them.
('81', 191, 1, 4, 306876) Today people ply the charkha.
('81', 191, 1, 5, 306906) But I wish that they learn operating the handloom.
('81', 191, 1, 6, 306957) They should send me woven khadi.
('81', 191, 1, 7, 306990) I do not need khadi for myself.
('81', 191, 1, 8, 307022) I have enough khadi for my personl use.
('81', 191, 1, 9, 307062) Hence it would be all right if people weave khadi and send it to the Charkha Sangh of their own Province, though, from one point of view, it is better to sent it to me so that I may know how the work is progressing from year to year both in quantity as well as in quality.
('81', 191, 1, 10, 307335) As years pass the quality of our yarn should improve.
('81', 191, 1, 11, 307389) But they should not pay railway freight in sending the yarn to me.
('81', 191, 1, 12, 307456) Only khadi should reach me.
('81', 191, 1, 13, 307484) It would be enough if just a specimen is sent to me.
('81', 191, 1, 14, 307537) All of us should devote greater energy and talent to khadi work.
('81', 191, 1, 15, 307602) This can be done even in jail.
('81', 191, 1, 16, 307633) Those who have been to prison once have to go there again and again.
('81', 191, 1, 17, 307702) There is no question of going back.
('81', 191, 1, 18, 307738) It does not mean that we shall do so indiscriminately.
('81', 191, 1, 19, 307793) We shall have to use our discretion.
('81', 191, 1, 20, 307830) How can we send to prison again a person whose health has been shattered during imprisonment in spite of the best efforts?
('81', 191, 1, 21, 307953) It will be a kind of violence.
('81', 191, 1, 22, 307984) Some people ask me : Why should the same persons go to jail again and again?
('81', 191, 1, 23, 308061) Why not select new men so that the satyagraha continues without causing much strain? I have already said that a non violent war has its own strategy.
('81', 191, 1, 24, 308211) We cannot follow Hitlerian tactics.
('81', 191, 1, 25, 308247) A barbaric war is being fought in Europe with large scale massacres.
('81', 191, 1, 26, 308316) Young, old, even invalids, are being annihilated.
('81', 191, 1, 27, 308366) Even barbaric war demands sacrifices.
('81', 191, 1, 28, 308404) In a non violent war there is no scope for sacrifices on such a gigantic scale.
('81', 191, 1, 29, 308484) Here we seek to employ moral pressure.
('81', 191, 1, 30, 308523) This will entail sacrifices on the part of a select few.
('81', 191, 1, 31, 308580) We have not been called upon to make any great sacrifices till now.
('81', 191, 1, 32, 308648) What are our sacrifices worth if we are not prepared to face even the hardship of prison life time and again?
('81', 191, 1, 33, 308758) There is one other question.
('81', 191, 1, 34, 308787) Should we carry on the struggle within the four walls of the prison?
('81', 191, 1, 35, 308856) Many problems arise there also.
('81', 191, 1, 36, 308888) The matter of A, B and C classes creates much bitterness.
('81', 191, 1, 37, 308946) What should we do there?
('81', 191, 1, 38, 308971) These classes are a creation of Congressmen themselves.
('81', 191, 1, 39, 309027) I am convinced that these classes will ultimately be abolished.
('81', 191, 1, 40, 309091) In the mean time, there is much scope for improvement in the diet of C class prisoners.
('81', 191, 1, 41, 309179) I have already said that doctors can bring about the much

('81', 192, 1, 2, 309285) needed improvement in this matter if they so desire.
('81', 192, 1, 3, 309338) But granting that the doctors cannot do anything, even then this struggle will have to continue.
('81', 192, 1, 4, 309435) The satyagrahis will repeatedly go to prison.
('81', 192, 1, 5, 309481) Prison life will be full of hardships.
('81', 192, 1, 6, 309520) It will mean starvation and even if it causes death in some cases I shall be prepared to face that eventuality.
('81', 192, 1, 7, 309632) We should all be ready for it.
('81', 192, 1, 8, 309663) We have simply on other course open to us.
('81', 192, 1, 9, 309706) Our war demands sacrifices, hardships and suffering.
('81', 192, 1, 10, 309759) That is how the war of ahimsa is waged.

('81', 192, 5, 16, 309988) I think I told you I had your amendments of the Constitution which was placed before the meeting.

('81', 192, 5, 20, 310210) Lilavati is free from her fever.
('81', 192, 5, 21, 310243) Maganlal 2 has returned from Delhi after having sat for his examination.
('81', 192, 5, 22, 310316) He is plucky.
('81', 192, 5, 23, 310330) This was his third failure.

('81', 193, 8, 10, 311140) DEAR DR.
('81', 193, 8, 11, 311149) MOOKERJI, I thank you for your letter.
('81', 193, 8, 12, 311188) Supposing Christians as such wanted to get rid of some social abuse and established an association for dealing with it, I should think they would restrict admission to fellow Christians only.
('81', 193, 8, 13, 311380) If you admit this, you will appreciate the restriction in Harijan Sevak Sangh.
('81', 193, 8, 14, 311459) Hindus have sinned and they must purge themselves.
('81', 193, 8, 15, 311510) The others can extend their sympathy but cannot do repentance.
('81', 193, 8, 16, 311573) Of course, there is untouchability among Christians and Muslims, thanks to the highly infectious disease in the Hindu body.
('81', 193, 8, 17, 311697) Hindus can only help the latter by completely curing themselves of the disease, but the rest has to be dealt with by the respective communities.
('81', 193, 8, 18, 311842) The obvious is being missed because of the political results.
('81', 193, 8, 19, 311904) But the root of the evil is in the corruption of religion.
('81', 193, 8, 20, 311963) If this is not clear, you should pursue the subject, till at least we agree as to the results.
('81', 193, 8, 21, 312058) I hope your wife is well.
('81', 193, 8, 22, 312084) Of course, you will come when you can.

('81', 198, 7, 20, 318880) I wonder if you, too, have the right atmosphere for a Diwali there.
('81', 198, 7, 21, 318948) Your new High Commissioner is going to call on me.
('81', 198, 7, 22, 318999) He writes and tells me that he will remain completely neutral.

('81', 199, 2, 5, 319509) What can be the value of my opinion now?
('81', 199, 2, 6, 319550) I will state it, however.
('81', 199, 2, 7, 319576) Let the friends take the pledge if they wish.
('81', 199, 2, 8, 319622) I have discovered from bitter experience that they do not know the meaning of a pledge.
('81', 199, 2, 9, 319710) Perhaps the best course would be to remain in contact with them and be content with whatever they do.

('81', 200, 1, 5, 320636) Prithvi Chand will give you a full account when he comes.
('81', 200, 1, 6, 320694) He has said that Sushila must not come to Sevagram before her examination.
('81', 200, 1, 7, 320769) Mother should not come to visit him if she is not going to stay at Sevagram.
('81', 200, 1, 8, 320846) He wants to meet Mahadev.

('81', 201, 12, 20, 322894) Rearing a baby requires as much care as carrying it.

('81', 202, 1, 3, 323354) Please take my word for this, for I am writing it from personal observation.
('81', 202, 1, 4, 323431) You should, therefore, make it a point to eat food only as medicine, and not to please your palate.
('81', 202, 1, 5, 323531) The relish which one gets from this medicine is true relish and is nourishing.
('81', 202, 1, 6, 323610) Do not understand the word medicine in its strict dictionary sense and be repelled by it.
('81', 202, 1, 7, 323700) Milk can be taken both as medicine and for the pleasure of the palate.
('81', 202, 1, 8, 323771) The first way of taking it will nourish the body and the second will harm it.
('81', 202, 1, 9, 323849) The baby should get proper exercise, fresh air, massage, etc.
('81', 202, 1, 10, 323911) Do not listen to anybody else in this matter.
('81', 202, 1, 11, 323957) Many people will want to pamper the baby.
('81', 202, 1, 12, 323999) But whatever they might say, remain firm in your resolution.
('81', 202, 1, 13, 324060) This was the idea behind my dream.
('81', 202, 1, 14, 324095) I hope you are in good health and that the baby is growing well.

('81', 208, 9, 12, 330922) From your previous letter I read a different meaning from what I read in your letter.
('81', 208, 9, 13, 331008) I have now asked Kanu 8 to go to you.
('81', 208, 9, 14, 331046) His love for Abha 9 is still there.
('81', 208, 9, 15, 331082) But he realizes that he erred and has therefore resigned himself to forfeiture of Abhas hand.
('81', 208, 9, 16, 331176) If you and your wife wish and Abha is eager to marry Kanu, then and then only should she come to me.
('81', 208, 9, 17, 331277) If she comes you have to forget her for the time being as you have Sailen 10 and Dhiren 11 till they have finished their course and are on their way to earning their bread.
('81', 208, 9, 18, 331450) Abha will be trained here and will be sent to Rajkot too, if I pass her.
('81', 208, 9, 19, 331523) If both restrain themselves and Abha still likes Kanu and likes his parents and surroundings and keeps her health, she will be married to Kanu.
('81', 208, 9, 20, 331667) So far as I can see both will have to wait for two years before

('81', 209, 1, 8, 332626) I am glad you are all well now.
('81', 209, 1, 9, 332658) Dont expect anything from Sailen now.

('81', 213, 2, 4, 337353) The restrictions are imposed on teachers of Government schools mainly with the object of preserving the authority of the Government.
('81', 213, 2, 5, 337486) This I think is sufficient reason for quitting Government service.
('81', 213, 2, 6, 337553) But if you want to continue in it, truthfulness lies in following Government rules as long as the fetters are not removed as a result of the freedom movement.
('81', 213, 2, 7, 337712) There must be regulations in non governmental national institutions also.
('81', 213, 2, 8, 337786) Teachers should have a say in formulating them.

('81', 216, 8, 12, 341749) I think they would rank high among the existing text books.
('81', 216, 8, 13, 341809) But I have not been able to convince others of my view.

('81', 216, 8, 15, 341923) I had said that my attempt was not to add one more book to the number of many good books.
('81', 216, 8, 16, 342013) I wanted one book to replace all the others for that standard.
('81', 216, 8, 17, 342076) I stick to my view even now.
('81', 216, 8, 18, 342105) But I see that it will not hold at the moment.
('81', 216, 8, 19, 342152) If anyone from among our teachers succeeds in such an enterprise, he may lead the way.
('81', 216, 8, 20, 342239) I want to prize open the minds of millions.
('81', 216, 8, 21, 342283) I do believe they must open up.
('81', 216, 8, 22, 342315) Knowledge of the alphabet develops the intelligence but little.
('81', 216, 8, 23, 342379) Rather, it thwarts the development.
('81', 216, 8, 24, 342415) And it costs a great deal, as I do.
('81', 216, 8, 25, 342451) From that angle these two books do not make the grade.
('81', 216, 8, 26, 342506) The illustrations are comparatively good but need much improvement.

('81', 218, 1, 2, 344027) 400. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS
('81', 218, 2, 3, 344055) WARDHAGANJ, October 21, 1941 The publication of the statement attributed to Shri Jayaprakash Narayan, which he is stated to have attempted to smuggle from his place of detention, does not, so far as I can see, lead us anywhere.
('81', 218, 2, 4, 344283) 1 If the motive was to discredit the organization of which Jayaprakash Narayan is a distinguished member, it must fail.
('81', 218, 2, 5, 344403) Assuming the correctness of the charge against Jayaprakash Narayan, the method advocated by him is against the policy of truth and non violence adopted by the Congress, and he deserves the severest condemnation.
('81', 218, 2, 6, 344615) But it ill becomes the Government to condemn or discredit it.
('81', 218, 2, 7, 344677) Frankly, all nationalist forces, no matter by what name they are described, are at war with the Government.
('81', 218, 2, 8, 344785) And, according to the accepted canons of war, the method adopted by Jayaprakash Narayan is perfectly legitimate.
('81', 218, 2, 9, 344898) He has had his training in America for seven long years and is a student of the methods adopted by Western nations in their fight for freedom.
('81', 218, 2, 10, 345041) To practise deception, to resort to secret methods and even to plot murder, are all honourable and turn the perpetrators into national heroes.
('81', 218, 2, 11, 345184) Are not Clive and Warren Hastings British heroes?
('81', 218, 2, 12, 345234) If Jayaprakash Narayan was in the British Diplomatic Service and by secret diplomacy achieved something of importance, he would be covered with distinction.
('81', 218, 2, 13, 345391) The sensation with which the event has been disclosed to the Indian world is ill conceived.
('81', 218, 2, 14, 345483) The annotations in the communique are probably wholly unwarranted.
('81', 218, 2, 15, 345550) When it is borne in mind that Jayaprakash Narayan is an untried detenu, the annotations look very like hitting below the belt.
('81', 218, 2, 16, 345677) The Government should have shown Jayaprakash the document or documents seized, and published his answer if he had any to give.
('81', 218, 2, 17, 345804) The way in which his poor wife has been dragged in is unfortunate.
('81', 218, 2, 18, 345871) She knew nothing of the attempt, for it was frustrated
('81', 218, 3, 19, 345926) 1 A communique issued by the Government on October 16 said : Plans to consolidate the position of the Congress Socialist Party by winning over important members of the terrorist organizations, known as the Revolutionary Socialist Party and the Hindustan Republican Socialist Association and by isolating the Communist Party, were seized from Mr. Jayaprakash Narayan, security prisoner, Deoli Camp, when he attempted to pass them to his wife, Prabhavati Devi, at an interview.
('81', 219, 0, 1, 346402) 220 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 219, 1, 2, 346444) before anything could reach her.
('81', 219, 1, 3, 346477) I may inform the public that Prabhavati does not share Jayaprakash Narayans views.
('81', 219, 1, 4, 346560) She was put under my charge by her parents when she was not yet fifteen and while her husband Jayaprakash was still in America.
('81', 219, 1, 5, 346688) She has wholly accepted my view of Indian politics and is one of my most faithful co workers.
('81', 219, 1, 6, 346782) As husband and wife, Jayaprakash Narayan and Prabhavati Devi are an ideal couple.
('81', 219, 1, 7, 346864) Jayaprakash has never sought to impose his views on Prabhavati.
('81', 219, 1, 8, 346928) He has never prevented her from freely coming to me.
('81', 219, 1, 9, 346981) Indeed, he has encouraged her to come to me whenever she has been ill.
('81', 219, 1, 10, 347052) She has never been taken into the secrets of the Socialist Party.
('81', 219, 1, 11, 347118) The alleged communication has completely upset her, for she never thought that her husband would advocate the method attributed to him.
('81', 219, 1, 12, 347254) The suggestion made in some newspapers that the restrictions on prisoners should be tightened is wholly irrelevant to Jayaprakash Narayans attempt.
('81', 219, 1, 13, 347402) That it was frustrated is enough proof of the efficiency of the C. I. D. Even if there is laxity, it can be no warrant for giving them bad or insufficient food, or keeping them in places far away from their homes, making it difficult or expensive for relatives to visit detenus.
('81', 219, 1, 14, 347681) I have read Shri N. M. Joshis very careful and over moderate recommendations 1 about the Deoli Camp.
('81', 219, 1, 15, 347782) I have learnt enough about it to enable me to say, in the name of humanity, that the Camp should be disbanded and the prisoners should be sent nearer their homes.
('81', 219, 1, 16, 347945) It is wrong, from every point of view, to bring prisoners from their provinces and concentrate them in a place where there is no facility either of provisions or medical assistance or other amenities of life.
('81', 219, 1, 17, 348154) Prisoners of war are treated like princes compared to political prisoners, whose status would be any day superior to that of prisoners of war.
('81', 219, 2, 18, 348297) One word to Congressmen.
('81', 219, 2, 19, 348322) While Jayaprakash Narayan remains the patriot we have known him, they must realize that his method is harmful in the extreme while a non violent struggle is going on.
('81', 219, 2, 20, 348489) I have said, repeatedly, that secrecy has no place in a non violent organization.
('81', 219, 2, 21, 348571) No underhand or underground movement can ever become a mass movement or stir millions to mass action.
('81', 219, 2, 22, 348673) I am glad, therefore, that Shri Purshottam Tricumdas, Secretary of the Socialist
('81', 219, 3, 23, 348754) 1 N. M. Joshi had, with the Governments permission, visited Deoli in July and published his impressions and suggestions.

('81', 220, 1, 2, 348922) Party, has repudiated the method said to be advocated by Jayaprakash Narayan.
('81', 220, 1, 3, 349000) Indeed, I would appeal to Jayaprakash Narayan to reconsider his philosophy and, if his reason can approve, to repudiate the method as a lapse from sound reason and the loyalty he owes to the Congress.
('81', 220, 1, 4, 349201) What he has stigmatized as a farce of satyagraha is not a farce.
('81', 220, 1, 5, 349266) It is the fine fruit of mature experience of thirty three years experimenting in truth and non violence; and, if God wills it, I hope to demonstrate that from this farce will rise a reality which will compel admission even by Jayaprakash Narayan and those who think with him.
('81', 220, 1, 6, 349542) Jayaprakash did not indeed go to prison as a satyagrahi, 1 but he has not ceased to be a member of the Congress, and so it is not proper for him and others who think with him to retard the movement by their action, which is admittedly disloyal to the Congress.

('81', 221, 11, 20, 351021) The responsibility for the stoppage of satyagraha in Sind is Maulana Azads and ultimately mine.
('81', 221, 11, 21, 351117) I shall not grant permission to any Sindhi friend to offer satyagraha without the permission of the Maulana.
('81', 221, 11, 22, 351226) I can safely state that neither you nor any other Congressman from Sind has any hand in the stoppage of satyagraha in Sind.

('81', 222, 1, 2, 351729) 404. LETTER TO AGATHA HARRISON October 22, 1941
('81', 222, 2, 3, 351777) MY DEAR AGATHA, I have kept by me your letter of 15th July.
('81', 222, 2, 4, 351837) I did not know what to say nor do I know now.
('81', 222, 2, 5, 351883) I understand your earnestness and grief.
('81', 222, 2, 6, 351924) But I do not know how to console you.
('81', 222, 2, 7, 351962) However detached you may try to be, you cannot but be influenced by your surroundings.
('81', 222, 2, 8, 352049) It is equally true of me, not to talk of others.
('81', 222, 2, 9, 352098) Add to this the difficulty of answering in the middle of October a letter written in the middle of July.
('81', 222, 2, 10, 352203) And this when every day means new history.
('81', 222, 2, 11, 352246) I have therefore the greatest reluctance even to write to you in spite of the pleasure it gives me to write to you.
('81', 222, 2, 12, 352362) But I must try.
('81', 222, 2, 13, 352378) Distrust of the Rulers is growing and spreading.
('81', 222, 2, 14, 352427) The distance is increasing.
('81', 222, 2, 15, 352455) We here perceive no difference between Hitlerism and British Imperialism.
('81', 222, 2, 16, 352529) Hitlerism is a superfine copy of Imperialism and Imperialism is trying to overtake Hitlerism as fast as it can.
('81', 222, 2, 17, 352641) Democracy is nowhere.
('81', 222, 2, 18, 352663) In this unholy duel, so far as I can see, non violence is working its way in a silent but sure manner.
('81', 222, 2, 19, 352766) My fatih in it is daily growing stronger.
('81', 222, 2, 20, 352808) Whether as Polak says, and as you almost hint, 1 I think, in your most gentle manner, it can stand the strain if bombs were dropping near my feet and I was witnessing dear ones being crushed to death, I cannot say.
('81', 222, 2, 21, 353023) I rehearse such situations, I pray that the faith might not break under such strain.
('81', 222, 2, 22, 353108) I flatter myself with the belief that I can feel these things from afar.
('81', 222, 2, 23, 353181) I did shed a silent tear when I read about the damage done to the Houses of Parliament, the Westminster Abbey and St. Pauls.
('81', 222, 2, 24, 353306) Nevertheless this is all speculation.
('81', 222, 2, 25, 353344) If I fail in the examination, if it ever came to me, I shall have the courage to admit my weakness but I will not deny my faith in non violence.
('81', 222, 2, 26, 353489) Of communal unity there is no immediate hope, though I believe that it will come sooner than we expect.
('81', 222, 2, 27, 353593) But that will bring no settlement with the British Government.
('81', 222, 2, 28, 353656) In their declarations there are many impossible conditions.
('81', 222, 2, 29, 353716) One is that we must get the Princes also to agree.
('81', 222, 2, 30, 353767) Now the Princes mean the British Government, for the former are the latters creation and they cannot even talk openly with
('81', 222, 3, 31, 353890) 1 The addressee explains : I did not hint that his non violence could not stand the strain of bombing, but asked him if sometimes compromise of method not of aim could be considered.

('81', 223, 1, 3, 354151) The Rulers feel a sense of security in the existing situation.
('81', 223, 1, 4, 354214) The Princes obedient, the Muslim League showing its harmless teeth, and the Congress led by me following its equally harmless Civil Disobedience.
('81', 223, 1, 5, 354360) They find no difficulty in squeezing the last pice and getting as many recruits as they want.
('81', 223, 1, 6, 354454) Can you now have a glimpse of why you find endless difficulties in the pursuit of your thankless task?
('81', 223, 1, 7, 354557) But you must .
('81', 223, 1, 8, 354572) 1 It is never wasted if it is sown in cultivable soil.
('81', 223, 1, 9, 354627) My own and hence the Congress method is incredibly simple.
('81', 223, 1, 10, 354686) Its token Civil Disobedience must continue.
('81', 223, 1, 11, 354730) It will blaze forth when the question of embarrassment disappears.
('81', 223, 1, 12, 354797) The Congress is ready for any honourable compromise with any party including the Rulers, consistently with its fundamentals.
('81', 223, 1, 13, 354922) Nothing short of Complete Independence can be acceptable to the Congress.
('81', 223, 1, 14, 354996) The Congress cannot be party to the war efforts and therefore cannot take office.
('81', 223, 1, 15, 355078) But Civil Disobedience can be stopped if free speech consistently with non violence is recognized and all political prisoners are unconditionally discharged.
('81', 223, 1, 16, 355236) This excludes those who have been tried and found guilty of actual violence unless they repent.
('81', 223, 1, 17, 355332) It includes all untried men.
('81', 223, 1, 18, 355361) So far as I can see, the Congress will not change its policy so long as I am alive and well enough to think clearly and advise.
('81', 223, 1, 19, 355489) There is no one who has any sympathy with Nazism or Fascism but there is no one who has any sympathy for Imperialism [either], not even the recruits who hire themselves out for the sake of bread.
('81', 223, 1, 20, 355685) Some join because they want military training at any cost.
('81', 223, 1, 21, 355744) Now you have a picture as true as I can draw of India to date.
('81', 223, 1, 22, 355807) My advice is dont worry, dont fret.
('81', 223, 1, 23, 355843) You need not write, need not speak, unless you feel an irresistible impulse.
('81', 223, 1, 24, 355920) Let prayer of the heart be our sole and sure refuge.
('81', 223, 1, 25, 355973) It is enough to realize that not a blade moves but by His will.
('81', 223, 1, 26, 356037) He allows this slaughter.
('81', 223, 1, 27, 356063) We do not know why.
('81', 223, 1, 28, 356083) But if we keep our hands, head and heart stainless let us believe that in His own good time, He will use us to stop this apparently senseless mutual slaughter.
('81', 223, 1, 29, 356243) Amrit is not with me for the moment.
('81', 223, 1, 30, 356280) She is in Simla resting.

('81', 225, 11, 18, 358092) SEVAGRAM, October 22, 1941 As regards diet, I am quite convinced that the food cooked in the Ashram kitchen would, with slight adjustments, be suitable for the people in Sevagram also.
('81', 225, 11, 19, 358277) The food served at the Khadi Vidyalaya or to C class prisoners would not do.
('81', 225, 11, 20, 358354) The standard of food prepared in our kitchen here would be found suitable.
('81', 225, 11, 21, 358429) In this regard we have taken into consideration the opinions of doctors all over India and we consult them even now.
('81', 225, 11, 22, 358546) At the Ashram we can protect ourselves from a number of diseases.
('81', 225, 11, 23, 358612) Whatever illness persists is due to the fact that all of us are not frugal eaters.
('81', 225, 12, 24, 358695) 1 This is written on the same sheet as the preceding item.
('81', 225, 12, 25, 358754) 2 Sevagram workers had sought from Gandhiji an appointment specially to hear his views on an ideal village community.
('81', 226, 0, 1, 358872) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 227
('81', 226, 1, 2, 358919) Everyone must get two 1b.
('81', 226, 1, 3, 358945) of milk, two tolas of ghee and two and a half tolas of butter daily.
('81', 226, 1, 4, 359014) Vegetables such as we have here are also essential for everybody.
('81', 226, 1, 5, 359080) Perhaps in the case of those who do physical labour it may be necessary to increase the quantity of grain; they may need dal too, though we do not use it in our kitchen.
('81', 226, 1, 6, 359250) But the quantity of milk and butter we take can be reduced to some extent.
('81', 226, 1, 7, 359325) Skimmed milk can and ought to be used in our kitchen.
('81', 226, 1, 8, 359379) It is wrong in a way not to use it.
('81', 226, 1, 9, 359415) It has everything except ghee and it is cheaper too.
('81', 226, 1, 10, 359468) We certainly want to reduce the cost of our diet.
('81', 226, 1, 11, 359518) Skimmed milk should suffice for our villagers.
('81', 226, 1, 12, 359565) They must have some fruit too.
('81', 226, 1, 13, 359596) At present they get no fruit at all, though they may have some sort of mangoes during the season.
('81', 226, 1, 14, 359694) They should have fruit in the same proportion as we have for the Ashram inmates.
('81', 226, 1, 15, 359775) Tamarind, lemons and tomatoes are essential for them.
('81', 226, 1, 16, 359829) They can manage with them.
('81', 226, 1, 17, 359856) They may also require some spices, though we do not have them in the Ashram and according to me they are not at all necessary.
('81', 226, 1, 18, 359983) But I do not believe that spices have no place in our villagers diet.
('81', 226, 1, 19, 360053) They can have some vitamins from the spices also.
('81', 226, 1, 20, 360103) But spices cannot take the place of milk as some people mistakenly believe.
('81', 226, 1, 21, 360179) I have found that the body grows weak and health deteriorates by the excessive use of spices.
('81', 226, 1, 22, 360273) This will provide you some basis for calculating the expenditure on food.
('81', 226, 1, 23, 360347) The second necessity is clothing.
('81', 226, 1, 24, 360381) The loin cloth such as I wear is not meant for everybody and it is not necessary for all to adopt it.
('81', 226, 1, 25, 360483) Kurta, short dhoti and cap should suffice for men.
('81', 226, 2, 26, 360534) The womens dress in the Ashram has been rather strange.
('81', 226, 2, 27, 360590) I am of the opinion, however, that the dress of the women of the Punjab is the most suitable.
('81', 226, 2, 28, 360684) What Amtul Salaam sometimes wears would be, with some modifications, very good.
('81', 226, 2, 29, 360764) There is art in the kurta, dupatta and shalwar of the Punjab and in these every part of a womans body can be properly covered.
('81', 226, 2, 30, 360891) Mirabehn has nicely adapted it for herself.
('81', 226, 2, 31, 360935) The dupatta is artistic and at the same time very useful and comfortable during winter.
('81', 226, 2, 32, 361023) The kurta covers the womans body fully, the shalwar also is a complete dress in itself and lends the wearer grace.
('81', 226, 2, 33, 361138) The ghaghra is an absolutely inadequate dress and should never be worn without an under wear.
('81', 226, 2, 34, 361232) If we could not adopt a uniform dress even for the women in the Ashram, it is a very difficult proposition to do so for the whole of India.
('81', 226, 2, 35, 361372) There is great scope for improvement in the present dress of [our] women.
('81', 226, 2, 36, 361446) But I am not particularly bothered
('81', 227, 0, 1, 361481) 228 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 227, 1, 2, 361523) about this.
('81', 227, 1, 3, 361535) For the present it would suffice if we made our dresses entirely out of khadi.
('81', 227, 1, 4, 361614) These days people huddle together and sleep in the same room which is sometimes also shared by their cattle.
('81', 227, 1, 5, 361723) It keeps them warm but it is bad for their health, with the result that the mortality rate in India is the highest.
('81', 227, 1, 6, 361839) People will enjoy better health if they sleep in the open.
('81', 227, 1, 7, 361898) This will be possible only when they have sufficient clothing to cover themselves as we have in the Ashram.
('81', 227, 1, 8, 362006) Everyone must have at least a blanket and a heavy sheet of khadi.
('81', 227, 1, 9, 362072) People in the Ashram try to use quilt covers by stuffing them with paper but they become useless during the rains.
('81', 227, 1, 10, 362187) One does not, however, have to spend a lot on it.
('81', 227, 1, 11, 362237) Greater expenditure is needed on diet.
('81', 227, 1, 12, 362276) Thirdly, we have the housing problem.
('81', 227, 1, 13, 362314) Here we must first decide how much shelter is required per head.
('81', 227, 1, 14, 362379) Houses can be built with grass, mud and stalks.
('81', 227, 1, 15, 362427) At present it is not so in the Ashram.
('81', 227, 1, 16, 362466) I have allowed houses to be built with bricks but pucca houses are not essential in the villages.
('81', 227, 1, 17, 362564) They are costly.
('81', 227, 1, 18, 362581) Thatched mud houses would do in the villages.
('81', 227, 1, 19, 362627) Even as it is, rain water floods even our houses and we are faced with the problem of saving people from it.
('81', 227, 1, 20, 362736) Everybody should protect his own house.
('81', 227, 1, 21, 362776) I see no difficulty in it.
('81', 227, 1, 22, 362803) Perhaps for years to come the country cannot reach my ideal of housing.
('81', 227, 1, 23, 362875) I agree that houses in the Ashram are ideal houses.
('81', 227, 1, 24, 362927) In order to determine the ideal we will have to decide upon the covered area required per head.
('81', 227, 1, 25, 363023) It is however essential to provide separate shelter for the cattle.
('81', 227, 1, 26, 363091) At present people in Sevagram keep their cattle also in the house itself.
('81', 227, 1, 27, 363165) Their houses have poor sanitation.
('81', 227, 1, 28, 363200) They dont have enough room for the children.
('81', 227, 1, 29, 363245) Their houses should be so constructed as to admit plenty of fresh air and light.
('81', 227, 1, 30, 363326) Though the houses in the Ashram are poor dwellings even the rich can live comfortably in them.
('81', 227, 1, 31, 363421) The villages also should have such houses.
('81', 227, 1, 32, 363464) Today this is not the case but if the villagers co operate with us the situation can be improved to a great extent.
('81', 227, 1, 33, 363580) What I have said to you today is a matter of great importance.
('81', 227, 1, 34, 363643) I agree we cannot achieve complete success in the countryside unless we have the reins of government in our hands.
('81', 227, 1, 35, 363758) But if our dedication and service attain a high degree of perfection we shall not have to depend on the Government and a great many things can be done even without it.
('81', 227, 1, 36, 363926) The villagers should co operate with one another in regard to their cattle.
('81', 227, 1, 37, 364002) We should first find out the number of cattle in the village,
('81', 228, 0, 1, 364064) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 229
('81', 228, 1, 2, 364111) and decide whether all of them are needed or we can do with less by managing them on a co operative basis.
('81', 228, 1, 3, 364218) For instance, I do not consider it proper for every villager to own a bullock cart.
('81', 228, 1, 4, 364302) Cant we manage with much fewer bullock carts if we follow the co operative method?
('81', 228, 1, 5, 364385) The same thing applies to oxen and a number of other things.
('81', 228, 1, 6, 364446) The villagers can make much more profit if they have a co operative society for selling their grain.
('81', 228, 1, 7, 364547) The cattle of the entire village can likewise be accommodated on a contributory basis.
('81', 228, 1, 8, 364634) The villagers can make great progress if they work like this in co operation with one another.
('81', 228, 1, 9, 364729) Ours is a small village.
('81', 228, 1, 10, 364754) We should inquire and find out in which spheres of activity and to what extent we can work on a co operative basis.
('81', 228, 1, 11, 364870) Even if all villagers are not inclined to follow the co operative method we must find out those who are prepared to give it a trial.
('81', 228, 1, 12, 365003) Similarly, we should adopt the co operative method in farming too.
('81', 228, 1, 13, 365070) The entire produce of the village should be distributed only among those who have laboured for it.
('81', 228, 1, 14, 365169) This does not mean that the labour put in will not be taken into account.
('81', 228, 1, 15, 365243) A proper account of the labour put in by each individual will have to be maintained.
('81', 228, 1, 16, 365328) We should also decide about the crops we want to raise.
('81', 228, 1, 17, 365384) Those things which are essential for Sevagram should be given priority.
('81', 228, 1, 18, 365456) Cultivation for purposes of sale should be kept to the minimum.
('81', 228, 1, 19, 365520) We have been carrying on trade to some extent since the olden times and shall continue to do so within India as well as with foreign countries.
('81', 228, 1, 20, 365664) I shall not speak about other countries.
('81', 228, 1, 21, 365705) Let us consider what we can do here.
('81', 228, 1, 22, 365742) We should produce all the other necessities in the village itself.
('81', 228, 1, 23, 365809) Then we should also find out what other industries we can set up here.
('81', 228, 1, 24, 365880) We ought to press oil and make shoes locally.
('81', 228, 1, 25, 365926) Similarly we can think of other industries also.
('81', 228, 1, 26, 365975) You should decide what it is that you want to give priority to.
('81', 228, 1, 27, 366039) It is for you to examine all the aspects of farming.
('81', 228, 1, 28, 366092) I myself have not gone deep into this aspect and therefore am not at present in a position to guide you in this regard.
('81', 228, 1, 29, 366212) We have to think about education in Sevagram.
('81', 228, 1, 30, 366258) Though you have not asked me any question on this, I may at least tell you that in my opinion there should not be a single illiterate person in Sevagram.
('81', 228, 1, 31, 366412) I put forward the concept of basic education very late in my life but all the same I attach great importance to it.
('81', 228, 1, 32, 366528) I had put the following
('81', 229, 0, 1, 366552) 230 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 229, 1, 2, 366594) question before the Gujarati Sahitya Parishad 1 : What kind of literature are the writers bringing out for the crores of illiterate villagers?
('81', 229, 1, 3, 366737) This task is as huge as it is difficult.
('81', 229, 1, 4, 366778) Let me also tell you that our own life, if it is simple and pure, is bound to have its impact on the villagers without our having to tell them in so many words.
('81', 229, 1, 5, 366939) It is not our way to argue.
('81', 229, 1, 6, 366967) All our personal conduct should be well regulated and must conform to our ideal.
('81', 229, 1, 7, 367048) We have enough land in the Ashram and we can cultivate it as a model farm.
('81', 229, 1, 8, 367123) If I want, I can have the entire land in the village bought up but I have forbidden further purchase of land for the time being and, until I am able to distribute the entire proceeds among the tillers of the soil, I do not want to purchase more land.
('81', 229, 1, 9, 367374) I must ask you for the present to set through the Ashram an example of ideal farming.
('81', 229, 1, 10, 367460) They will then try to follow it of their own accord.
('81', 229, 1, 11, 367513) At present farming in the Ashram is not as it should be and we are far behind the ideal.
('81', 229, 1, 12, 367602) Our expenditure too is excessive and we must remedy this situation.
('81', 229, 1, 13, 367670) We shall make steady progress only when we persistently direct all our experiments towards our ideal.
('81', 229, 1, 14, 367772) I want you to associate the Ashram women also with your experiments.
('81', 229, 1, 15, 367841) They will be of great help to you.
('81', 229, 1, 16, 367876) You wont be able to do without them; besides, they have to be trained for this work.
('81', 229, 1, 17, 367961) Thus Sevagram will become a sort of republic.
('81', 229, 1, 18, 368007) You may appoint some person as your leader for a few years but later you will be able to do without him, for a republic has no place for a leader.
('81', 229, 1, 19, 368154) People know one another closely, unlike what we find in the elections where millions of voters dont even know who the candidate is.
('81', 229, 1, 20, 368286) A popular leader cannot suppress the people.
('81', 229, 1, 21, 368331) We had some such institution in the olden days.
('81', 229, 1, 22, 368379) But the British destroyed everything.
('81', 229, 1, 23, 368417) They are trying to suppress the villagers through their military strength.
('81', 229, 1, 24, 368492) Once this force loses its grip, there will be no place for the police, the village headman, the patwari and the like.
('81', 229, 1, 25, 368610) Only the toughs will remain.
('81', 229, 1, 26, 368639) But the people can take care of them.
('81', 229, 1, 27, 368677) Unless we do this we shall not attain the ideal social order based on truth and ahimsa.
('81', 229, 1, 28, 368765) I am convinced that a non violent society can be built only on the foundation of harmony and co operation, without which society is bound to remain violent.
('81', 229, 1, 29, 368922) If we argue that this cannot be done it will mean that a non violent society can never come into being.
('81', 229, 1, 30, 369026) In that case our entire culture would be meaningless.
('81', 229, 1, 31, 369080) How can

('81', 230, 1, 2, 369212) we call this ideal an impossibility while professing faith in human nature?
('81', 230, 1, 3, 369288) Of course it presupposes ahimsa of a high order.
('81', 230, 1, 4, 369337) The ahmisa required for driving the British out of India need not be of so high a quality; but the steps we shall have to take to cleanse our own hearts cannot be taken without ahimsa of a very high order.
('81', 230, 1, 5, 369543) For instance, the Hindu Muslim tension cannot be removed without true ahimsa.
('81', 230, 1, 6, 369621) We followed the path of ahimsa to face the British because we had no violent force.
('81', 230, 1, 7, 369705) This was not true ahimsa.
('81', 230, 1, 8, 369731) Ahimsa dwells not in the hearts of the cowards but in the hearts of the brave.
('81', 230, 1, 9, 369810) The Negroes are physically robust, their chests are worth admiration but the British have filled them with fear, so much so that a sturdy Negro trembles at the sight of a white child.
('81', 230, 1, 10, 369994) The same is the plight of the Indians.
('81', 230, 1, 11, 370033) Although in physical strength, we are nothing compared to the Negroes, our experiments, imperfect as they are, in ahimsa have had a profound impact.
('81', 230, 1, 12, 370182) My faith in human nature is progressively growing.
('81', 230, 1, 13, 370233) I have concluded, on the basis of my experiments, that human nature can be easily moulded.
('81', 230, 1, 14, 370324) We have come to assume, because of our inertia, that human nature is always the same and seldom amenable to progress.
('81', 230, 1, 15, 370442) Churchill and Hitler are striving to change the nature of their respective countrymen by forcing and hammering violent methods on them.
('81', 230, 1, 16, 370578) Man may be suppressed in this manner but he cannot be changed.
('81', 230, 1, 17, 370641) Ahimsa, on the other hand, can change human nature and sooner than men like Churchill and Hitler can.
('81', 230, 1, 18, 370743) If you can digest what I have said to you today and if you acquire the strength to act accordingly, I shall be saying many more things.
('81', 230, 1, 19, 370879) Discuss fully all this amongst yourselves and put up before me a definite scheme of what you can do.
('81', 230, 1, 20, 370980) I shall answer all your doubts from time to time.
('81', 230, 1, 21, 371030) Today I have talked to you at great length and some of the things I have said to you are not only new but also very vital.
('81', 230, 1, 22, 371153) You should try to digest them before asking me any questions, for otherwise your questions will lack the force of careful thinking.

('81', 231, 0, 1, 371323) 232 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 231, 1, 2, 371365) 410. AN ERROR The khadi movement, I find, has gone on for more than 21 years.
('81', 231, 1, 3, 371443) But while on the one hand we do not have a sufficient number of weavers, on the other the millions of idle weavers in India do not use our yarn for weaving.
('81', 231, 1, 4, 371600) Is it any error on our part which leads to this double failure?
('81', 231, 1, 5, 371664) I shall try to answer this question today.
('81', 231, 1, 6, 371707) I am of the opinion that this is but the result of our own folly.
('81', 231, 1, 7, 371773) If I were to find fault with anyone in this effort it could be only myself.
('81', 231, 1, 8, 371849) When I placed khadi on such a high pedestal I should have considered all aspects of the problem.
('81', 231, 1, 9, 371946) However, many vital things were first revealed to me in their generality and the finer details were only gradually worked out.
('81', 231, 1, 10, 372073) The fact that spinning involves carding was discovered only through experience.
('81', 231, 1, 11, 372153) The process of ginning cotton came to light only later.
('81', 231, 1, 12, 372209) I knew that the yarn would have to be woven but I had not imagined then that it would be a difficult process.
('81', 231, 1, 13, 372319) Even when I knew it I did not clearly see the solution as I see it now.
('81', 231, 1, 14, 372391) The solution is that khadi workers must learn the process of weaving even as a matter of atonement.
('81', 231, 1, 15, 372491) The best of our spinners have come from the same class.
('81', 231, 1, 16, 372547) That is how we could make good progress in spinning.
('81', 231, 1, 17, 372600) In the same manner we should have made weaving compulsory for the khadi workers.
('81', 231, 1, 18, 372681) When we learn this art we shall fully understand the weavers difficulties in using hand spun yarn.
('81', 231, 1, 19, 372780) Only then can we find a remedy for the difficulties and the professional weavers will follow us in using hand spun yarn.
('81', 231, 1, 20, 372901) Not that I had never thought of this.
('81', 231, 1, 21, 372939) The work of weaving hand spun yarn was first started long ago by the late Maganlal Gandhi and by Manilal Gandhi.
('81', 231, 1, 22, 373052) But I did not insist that everyone or certain people must weave, as I used to insist that they must spin.
('81', 231, 1, 23, 373158) As a result of this error the process of weaving has not been as widely taken up by khadi workers as it should have been.
('81', 231, 1, 24, 373280) I am of the opinion that one among every five, seven or ten spinners must become a good weaver.
('81', 231, 1, 25, 373376) Weaving cannot be done by one man.
('81', 231, 1, 26, 373411) One needs a companion for fixing the warp and for sizing.
('81', 231, 1, 27, 373469) One also needs the help of a boy or a girl to load the shuttle.
('81', 231, 1, 28, 373533) Any one can handle these processes as also the actual weaving on the loom.
('81', 231, 1, 29, 373608) But what I propose is that a certain proportion should become experts.
('81', 231, 1, 30, 373679) This will lead to great progress.
('81', 231, 1, 31, 373713) It is not necessary to tell me that this is already the practice at some centres.
('81', 231, 1, 32, 373795) My complaint is that I have not systematically insisted that one loom must operate where there are, say, five, seven or ten spinners.
('81', 231, 1, 33, 373929) Had I so insisted I would have got

('81', 232, 1, 2, 374011) today not yarn but woven goods.
('81', 232, 1, 3, 374043) The large number of satyagrahis in the prisons would not have been content with merely plying the charkha but would have had a loom and woven their yarn.
('81', 232, 1, 4, 374197) Weaving includes tapes, webbing, towels and coarse khadi as well as the fine dhotis or saris from Andhra with elaborately woven patterns.
('81', 232, 1, 5, 374335) When the processes of weaving all these items are present in our minds we shall not waste a single stretch of yarn.
('81', 232, 1, 6, 374451) We shall classify the different varieties of yarn, and weave them into appropriate cloth.
('81', 232, 1, 7, 374541) This error has also led to a lot of waste.
('81', 232, 1, 8, 374584) We used to throw away broken yarn as so much waste.
('81', 232, 1, 9, 374636) I know that many of the basic schools have begun taking care to avoid such waste.
('81', 232, 1, 10, 374718) We have to spread this knowledge.
('81', 232, 1, 11, 374752) This is just the beginning of basic education.
('81', 232, 1, 12, 374799) In fact it is the primary function of basic education to give thought to these problems, to investigate them scientifically and to suggest reform accordingly.
('81', 232, 1, 13, 374958) The most unfortunate result of this error has been our failure to enlist every weaver for our movement.
('81', 232, 1, 14, 375062) Why can we not approach the weaver with hand spun yarn instead of mill made yarn?
('81', 232, 1, 15, 375144) If we acknowledge our error and atone for it, there would be such a great improvement in hand spun yarn that it could compete with mill made yarn.
('81', 232, 1, 16, 375291) Perhaps it may not be possible to spin by hand as fine yarn as the mills can produce.
('81', 232, 1, 17, 375377) However, there need not be this vast difference between the two and the weaver need not have scorn on his face, as he now has, at the sight of hand spun yarn.

('81', 233, 8, 17, 376419) Hindi is absolutely good, language perfect and lettering quite nice.
('81', 233, 9, 18, 376488) Of course you have access to all my letters and answers.
('81', 233, 9, 19, 376545) I expect to be able to train you to do the whole of the editing in time.
('81', 233, 9, 20, 376618) You have a wonderful comand over your pen, only the thought formation has to come.
('81', 233, 9, 21, 376701) To produce the exact thought means exact understanding.
('81', 233, 9, 22, 376757) It is difficult when one has to interpret another.
('81', 233, 9, 23, 376808) But it is not beyond you I know.
('81', 233, 9, 24, 376841) You should begin to throw notes at me.
('81', 233, 9, 25, 376880) I may reject them all as you see I do Mahadevs.
('81', 233, 10, 26, 376928) I want to build a cottage for my convenience rather than yours.

('81', 242, 2, 3, 387062) MY DEAR IDIOT, I must hurry again.
('81', 242, 2, 4, 387097) I began a serious study of your rendering of Ks writing.
('81', 242, 2, 5, 387154) It has begun ill.
('81', 242, 2, 6, 387172) English is fairly good but the thought does not run smooth.
('81', 242, 2, 7, 387232) The whole must read logical.
('81', 242, 2, 8, 387261) You will see on your return what I mean.
('81', 242, 2, 9, 387302) It is a most difficult task and if you are found to have failed it wont be accounted as your fault.
('81', 242, 2, 10, 387402) Of course I shall deal with your chest.
('81', 242, 2, 11, 387442) You will stay in Jullunder as long as necessary.

('81', 242, 7, 16, 387631) DEAR SISTER, 1 I have your two letters, received simultaneously.
('81', 242, 7, 17, 387696) Here is a draft 2 for your reply.
('81', 242, 7, 18, 387730) It gives you my reaction to the Government letter.
('81', 242, 7, 19, 387781) Of course you will reject it, if it does not correctly represent your view.
('81', 242, 8, 20, 387857) I understand and appreciate all you say in your second letter.
('81', 242, 8, 21, 387920) My advice is that you should come here first and stay a few days so that we may have a leisurely chat.
('81', 242, 8, 22, 388023) Probably Satyawati will come.
('81', 242, 8, 23, 388053) You will then see her too.
('81', 242, 8, 24, 388080) I would advise you to see Sarup and the Hospital 3 and then see J. 4 and Indu 5. When you have finished this programme, you may break the order 6. The rest when we meet.

('81', 243, 8, 14, 389005) SEVAGRAM, October 28, 1941 I have been chary of issuing statements for the guidance of satyagrahis.
('81', 243, 8, 15, 389105) The deciding reason has been to have them to be self guided where they are not guided by local leaders.
('81', 243, 8, 16, 389209) But this chariness can easily be overdone.
('81', 243, 8, 17, 389252) Time seems to have arrived for a brief review especially as several leaders who have been discharged have met me and there has been much speculation about the trend or the result of these talks.
('81', 243, 8, 18, 389447) The public should know that those who were not whole heartedly with the Bombay Resolution 2 have come out with their doubts confirmed.
('81', 243, 8, 19, 389582) Similarly those who never had any doubts have become firmer than ever before in their opinion.
('81', 243, 8, 20, 389677) As for me I never had any doubt as to the correctness of the Bombay Resolution and have none about the correctness of the steps hitherto taken in pursuance thereof.
('81', 243, 8, 21, 389842) If I had, I could not, would not, have led a fight involving not only the fate of the Congress but even of the nation as a whole.
('81', 243, 8, 22, 389972) There is one saving grace in non violent action.
('81', 243, 8, 23, 390021) Unlike violent action, it being good in itself can never do real harm.
('81', 243, 9, 24, 390092) 1 Vide Statement to the Press, 28 10 1941. 2 Vide All India Congress Committee Resolution, 22 9 1940.
('81', 244, 0, 1, 390194) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 245
('81', 244, 1, 2, 390241) Complaints reach me (1) that there is marked deterioration in enthusiasm; (2) that fewer people are coming forward now than before; (3) that those who are discharged are not seeking impriso nment again; (4) that there is no discipline among many satyagrahi prisoners some of whom have no notion of non violence or truth; (5) that the treatment of C class prisoners is inhuman in that the food given is bad in quality and deficient in balance.
('81', 244, 1, 3, 390684) The result is that the majority of prisoners have suffered in health, making it impossible for many on discharge to seek imprisonment again without adequate rest and repair.
('81', 244, 1, 4, 390858) There are too complaints about want of newspapers, books and proper sanitation; (6) that the policy of non embarrassment is unintelligible, as the Rulers themselves do not appreciate it, and the fight therefore should be intensified without regard to embarrassment; (7) that there is no life left in the Congressthere are no meetings, there are no demonstrations, no other activity, and that there should be a change of policy and programme even resulting in the resumption of full parliamentary programme, including ministries, i.e., reversion to the Poona offer 1 with suitable modification.
('81', 244, 1, 5, 391452) (1 & 2) I shall consider the first two together.
('81', 244, 1, 6, 391501) Enthusiasm that is froth is of no use in non violent action.
('81', 244, 1, 7, 391562) Showy demonstrations and the like have a value in the initial stages.
('81', 244, 1, 8, 391632) Continuous feverish activity can only promote violence and therefore retard the steady march of non violent action, call it battle, if that word is preferred.
('81', 244, 1, 9, 391791) That fewer are coming forward is but natural.
('81', 244, 1, 10, 391837) For it must be recalled that civil disobedience is individual and restricted to representatives, be they even elected members of village or firka 2 committee.
('81', 244, 1, 11, 391996) The list of representatives being limited it must one day be exhausted.
('81', 244, 1, 12, 392068) I have no doubt that if I made a general call and relaxed the conditions of enrollment I should be overwhelmed by applications.
('81', 244, 1, 13, 392196) I have no machinery to examine such applications.
('81', 244, 1, 14, 392246) In reality it will be mass action which does not admit of individual examination and choice.
('81', 244, 1, 15, 392339) That call will not come before the close of the war.
('81', 244, 1, 16, 392392) There is neither warrant nor atmosphere for mass action.
('81', 244, 1, 17, 392449) That would be naked embarrassment and a betrayal of non violence.
('81', 244, 1, 18, 392515) What is more it can
('81', 244, 2, 19, 392535) 1 The reference is to the A.I.C.C. resolution passed at Poona on July 28, 1940; vide Statement to the Press, 15 6 1941.

('81', 245, 0, 1, 392663) 246 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 245, 1, 2, 392705) never lead to independence.
('81', 245, 1, 3, 392733) Mass action at this stage without communal unity is an invitation to civil war.
('81', 245, 1, 4, 392813) If civil war is to be our lot, it will come, but if I know the Congress mind, it will never come at the wish or invitation of the Congress.
('81', 245, 1, 5, 392953) (3) This complaint is partially valid.
('81', 245, 1, 6, 392992) It is true that some of those who have been discharged are reluctant to go back.
('81', 245, 1, 7, 393073) This is a novel experience for India.
('81', 245, 1, 8, 393111) I had to do it in South Africa.
('81', 245, 1, 9, 393143) The struggle demanded it there as it now does here.
('81', 245, 1, 10, 393195) Self suffering has no limit.
('81', 245, 1, 11, 393224) In the former civil disobedience the occasion had not come to send the same resisters to jail again and again.
('81', 245, 1, 12, 393335) In the present one it is inevitable.
('81', 245, 1, 13, 393372) Any other course would reduce the struggle to a farce.
('81', 245, 1, 14, 393427) The alternative suggested is that substitutes should be found for those who would not go in again.
('81', 245, 1, 15, 393526) Surely that is not the way of suffering.
('81', 245, 1, 16, 393567) And how can we think of gaining independence without a full measure of suffering?
('81', 245, 1, 17, 393649) The greater the cause the richer the suffering.
('81', 245, 1, 18, 393697) Therefore in this struggle they only will count who will seek imprisonment again and again, come what will.
('81', 245, 1, 19, 393805) They may be very few.
('81', 245, 1, 20, 393827) That will not matter.
('81', 245, 1, 21, 393849) Of course those who are ill will naturally not be required to go till they are restored.
('81', 245, 1, 22, 393938) Some have interpreted literally my statement 1
('81', 245, 2, 23, 393985) that the discharged satyagrahis may take about a week before they go.
('81', 245, 2, 24, 394055) Each case has to be judged on merits.
('81', 245, 2, 25, 394093) Shri Vinoba went in twice within 72 hours of his discharge.
('81', 245, 2, 26, 394153) He had to come to me before reoffering civil disobedience.
('81', 245, 2, 27, 394212) Hence even that little delay.
('81', 245, 2, 28, 394242) Shri Pyarelal took nearly a month before going in for the third time.
('81', 245, 2, 29, 394312) There were unavoidable causes which need not occupy the readers time and attention.
('81', 245, 2, 30, 394396) I have mentioned two cases which I was personally regulating.
('81', 245, 2, 31, 394458) They exemplify the elasticity I refer to.
('81', 245, 2, 32, 394500) There is no shame or harm in unavoidable delay.
('81', 245, 2, 33, 394548) Hypocrisy and camouflage must be avoided at all cost.
('81', 245, 2, 34, 394602) In satyagraha there is no waste of men or time or labour, provided that Satya is adhered to in its entirety.
('81', 245, 2, 35, 394711) I can otherwise utilize the services, as true soldiers of truth, of men and women who will whole heartedly carry out instructions.
('81', 245, 2, 36, 394842) Thus those who cannot for some just reason court imprisonment should engage themselves in corporate constructive activity.
('81', 245, 2, 37, 394965) Difficulty arises because many Congressmen, though they profess or believe in C. D., have no

('81', 246, 0, 1, 395106) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 247
('81', 246, 1, 2, 395153) faith in the constructive programme.
('81', 246, 1, 3, 395190) I must proclaim from the housetop for the thousandth time that constructive programme is an integral part of the national movement and therefore also of C. D. C. D. without the backing of the constructive programme is criminal and a waste of effort.
('81', 246, 1, 4, 395440) All cannot go to jail.
('81', 246, 1, 5, 395463) But all must work the constructive programme.
('81', 246, 1, 6, 395509) Even in armed conflict armies are power fully helped by the civil population.
('81', 246, 1, 7, 395587) Imagine the fate of the British forces, if their effort was not co ordinated with that of the civilians.
('81', 246, 1, 8, 395692) I was therefore delighted that there was a wide response from the prisoners and the other Congressmen this time in the matter of spinning during the spinning carnival 1. I dare to believe that if Congressmen were enthusiastic believers in communal unity and removal of untouchability and the like, there would be no communal discord and there would be no antagonism such as it is from Harijans.
('81', 246, 1, 9, 396087) We are the makers of our own destiny.
('81', 246, 1, 10, 396125) It has been somewhat justly said that if I am a good General, I must not grumble about my men.
('81', 246, 1, 11, 396220) For I must choose them from the material at my disposal.
('81', 246, 1, 12, 396277) I plead guilty.
('81', 246, 1, 13, 396293) But I have qualified my admission by the adverb somewhat, for I laid down the conditions from the very inception of the programme of non violence.
('81', 246, 1, 14, 396440) My terms were accepted.
('81', 246, 1, 15, 396464) If from experience it is found that the terms cannot be worked, I must either be dismissed or I must retire.
('81', 246, 1, 16, 396573) I retired 2 but to no purpose.
('81', 246, 1, 17, 396604) The bond between Congressmen and me seems to be unbreakable.
('81', 246, 1, 18, 396665) They may quarrel with my conditions but they will not leave me or let me go.
('81', 246, 1, 19, 396742) They know that however unskilled a servant I may be, I will neither desert them nor fail them in the hour of need.
('81', 246, 1, 20, 396857) And so they try, though often grumblingly, to fulfil my conditions.
('81', 246, 1, 21, 396925) I must then on the one hand adhere to my conditions so long as I have a living faith in them and, on the other, take what I can get from Congressmen, expecting that if I am true, they will some day fulfil all my conditions and find themselves in the enjoyment of full independence such as has never before been seen on earth.
('81', 246, 1, 22, 397251) (4) There are two sides to the complaint about indiscipline.
('81', 246, 1, 23, 397312) I must here confine myself to satyagrahi prisoners only.
('81', 246, 1, 24, 397369) I would naturally like the other political prisoners to attend to what I say.

('81', 247, 1, 2, 397556) wrong to say that there is universal indiscipline among Congressmen or that all are unfit to be called satyagrahis.
('81', 247, 1, 3, 397672) Cases of grave indiscipline have been brought to my notice.
('81', 247, 1, 4, 397732) I know that violent men have crept into the organization under the guise of non violence.
('81', 247, 1, 5, 397822) But I know also cases of exemplary discipline.
('81', 247, 1, 6, 397869) Everybody knows that there are in the movement and among the prisoners faithful Congressmen.
('81', 247, 1, 7, 397962) I am conducting the struggle in their name and for their sake.
('81', 247, 1, 8, 398025) It is through them that we may expect to win.
('81', 247, 1, 9, 398071) This should mean no reflection on those who are weak but true.
('81', 247, 1, 10, 398134) Even a child of seven who performs its allotted task faithfully will be entitled to the same credit as those who may cheerfully mount the gallows, if thereto called.
('81', 247, 2, 11, 398300) What is happening now is a process of automatic selection.
('81', 247, 2, 12, 398359) Those who cannot stand the test will stay out without dishonour.
('81', 247, 2, 13, 398424) Hypocrites and smugglers will be cast out because they will not stand the real heat or they will be rejected when found out.
('81', 247, 3, 14, 398549) (5) C class prisoners is almost a baffling question.
('81', 247, 3, 15, 398602) I have said more than once that classification is bad in itself.
('81', 247, 3, 16, 398667) But the Congress has come to no decision on the question.
('81', 247, 3, 17, 398725) Meanwhile we must do the best we can.
('81', 247, 3, 18, 398763) There is no manner of doubt in my mind that the treatment of C class prisoners is unhuman.
('81', 247, 3, 19, 398854) I do not wish to blame either the Government or the prison officials.
('81', 247, 3, 20, 398924) I admit that theirs is a thankless task.
('81', 247, 3, 21, 398965) For ages almost they have been used to only one tradition.
('81', 247, 3, 22, 399024) Their mind refuses to grasp the distinction between criminals and political prisoners.
('81', 247, 3, 23, 399111) They would make no distinction between prisoners guilty of crimes and those who rebel against constituted authority.
('81', 247, 3, 24, 399228) For them the political are worse than the others.
('81', 247, 3, 25, 399278) But pressure of public opinion has compelled distinction.
('81', 247, 3, 26, 399336) The result is highly unsatisfactory.
('81', 247, 3, 27, 399373) The will on the part of the officials is lacking.
('81', 247, 3, 28, 399423) Satyagrahis who seek imprisonment cannot with any dignity quarrel with the treatment they get, except when their honour is attacked.
('81', 247, 3, 29, 399556) An irresponsible government, which the British Government in India is may, as it often does, defy public opinion.
('81', 247, 3, 30, 399670) Satyagrahis have still to court imprisonment.
('81', 247, 3, 31, 399716) It is one of the gateways to liberty.
('81', 247, 3, 32, 399754) They cannot stipulate as to the conditions of jail life.
('81', 247, 3, 33, 399811) But weak as public opinion is, it can express itself with effect on a matter of pure humanity.
('81', 247, 3, 34, 399906) I have suggested that medical men should
('81', 248, 0, 1, 399947) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 249
('81', 248, 1, 2, 399994) give the lead in this matter.
('81', 248, 1, 3, 400024) I understand that a movement on their part is quite likely.
('81', 248, 1, 4, 400084) It is cruel to distinguish between the food of the different classes.
('81', 248, 1, 5, 400154) The needs in the majority of cases of the political prisoners are identical.
('81', 248, 1, 6, 400231) I suggest that the rations of all political prisoners should approach what is known as balanced diet with the permission to replenish it at the prisoners expense.
('81', 248, 1, 7, 400394) As to sanitation and other matters, a non official medical committee should make recommendations which should be given effect to at once.
('81', 248, 1, 8, 400532) There should be identity of treatment in all the provinces.
('81', 248, 1, 9, 400592) Having said this, I must warn satyagrahis against hunger strikes or the like.
('81', 248, 1, 10, 400670) It is their duty to conform to the jail regulations in so far as they do not come in conflict with known rules of honour, not self made ones by hyper sensitive temperaments.
('81', 248, 1, 11, 400844) These ought not to court imprisonment.
('81', 248, 1, 12, 400883) I suggest that it is a satyagrahis first code of honour that he will conscientiously carry out jail discipline with the reservation just mentioned.
('81', 248, 1, 13, 401031) Satyagraha is a process of silent conversion.
('81', 248, 1, 14, 401077) Indiscipline and nagging are wholly inconsistent with the ambition of conversion.
('81', 248, 1, 15, 401159) I am repeating these views of mine not without fear and trembling.
('81', 248, 1, 16, 401226) For I know that jail officials have often quoted them on wrong occasions against satyagrahi prisoners.
('81', 248, 1, 17, 401329) Of course in all I have said there is nothing against carrying out constitutional agitation for jail reforms even as to the so called criminals.
('81', 248, 1, 18, 401474) A satyagrahi is a universal reformer.
('81', 248, 1, 19, 401512) For him there is no distinction between criminals and non criminals.
('81', 248, 1, 20, 401581) He is out to render service to the whole of humanity to the extent of his ability and opportunity.
('81', 248, 1, 21, 401680) There is the question of newspapers and books.
('81', 248, 1, 22, 401727) These are as important as food.
('81', 248, 1, 23, 401759) Some would do without food but not without newspapers and literature.
('81', 248, 1, 24, 401829) I hold that deprivation of this amenity is additional punishment for a political prisoner.
('81', 248, 1, 25, 401920) (6) Although I have dealt with the question of non embarra ssment in my previous statements, I see that it still continues to agitate many Congressmen.
('81', 248, 1, 26, 402072) For one thing, it is part of the Bombay Resolution and effect should be given to it.
('81', 248, 1, 27, 402157) It is inherent in non violence.
('81', 248, 1, 28, 402189) But it is also expedient.
('81', 248, 1, 29, 402215) By causing embarrassment at this stage, the authorities must resent it bitterly and are likely to act madly.
('81', 248, 1, 30, 402324) Of course it would be different if we had resorted to armed rebellion.
('81', 249, 0, 1, 402395) 250 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 249, 1, 2, 402437) Then the saying their difficulty becomes our opportunity would apply.
('81', 249, 1, 3, 402507) It is obvious that exactly the opposite rule should apply when an opposite method is adopted.
('81', 249, 1, 4, 402601) It is worse than suicide to resort to violence, i.e., embarrassment under cover of non violence.
('81', 249, 1, 5, 402698) We may not be temperate and furious at the same time.
('81', 249, 1, 6, 402752) But then to be logical you must give up C. D. altogether, says the critic.
('81', 249, 1, 7, 402827) To give up C. D. would be folly.
('81', 249, 1, 8, 402860) C. D. is itself completely non violent action.
('81', 249, 1, 9, 402907) It is a duty in the face of violence without parallel.
('81', 249, 1, 10, 402962) C. D. in the present case means assertion of the right to speak against participation in this war or all war.
('81', 249, 1, 11, 403072) If we cannot do even this much when the occasion demands it, we might as well give up non violence.
('81', 249, 1, 12, 403172) C. D. is the assertion of a right which law should give but it denies.
('81', 249, 1, 13, 403243) If performance of a duty causes embarrassment, it cannot be helped.
('81', 249, 1, 14, 403311) It is my duty to give up drink.
('81', 249, 1, 15, 403343) It would cause some loss to the tavern keeper.
('81', 249, 1, 16, 403390) I am helpless.
('81', 249, 1, 17, 403405) The authority can easily avoid embarrassment by recognizing the elementary right of non violent free speech.
('81', 249, 1, 18, 403514) Consideration whether the policy of self imposed restraint creates an immediate impression on the authority is irrelevant.
('81', 249, 1, 19, 403637) Belief that it must ultimately is inherent in belief is non violence itself.
('81', 249, 1, 20, 403714) We may not bear ill will against the bitterest opponent.
('81', 249, 1, 21, 403771) (7) I do not share the belief that there is no life left in the Congress.
('81', 249, 1, 22, 403845) Still waters run deep. Congressmen are too much attached to the Congress to let the institution die of inanity.
('81', 249, 1, 23, 403957) There seems to be no life because we have no spectacular show in the shape of parliamentary programme or mass C. D. Things are going according to plan.
('81', 249, 1, 24, 404109) C. D. is restricted to select individuals.
('81', 249, 1, 25, 404152) It will be further restricted to those who reoffer C.D. as often as necessary.
('81', 249, 1, 26, 404231) It does not matter if the number is reduced to ten or two.
('81', 249, 1, 27, 404290) The two will represent the whole Congress.
('81', 249, 1, 28, 404333) Does not one ambassador represent his people?
('81', 249, 1, 29, 404379) One can be multiplied infinitely.
('81', 249, 1, 30, 404413) Parliamentary activity has been almost stopped also according to plan.
('81', 249, 1, 31, 404484) It may be, in my opinion should be, stopped completely.
('81', 249, 1, 32, 404540) But I do not wish to rush things.
('81', 249, 1, 33, 404574) Members of local boards have in many cases been withdrawn according to plan.
('81', 249, 1, 34, 404651) Then what are the Congressmen to do if they cannot or will not be allowed to offer C. D. and there is no parliamentary programme?
('81', 249, 1, 35, 404781) The answer is simple.
('81', 249, 1, 36, 404803) There are only two things for Congressmen to
('81', 250, 0, 1, 404848) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 251
('81', 250, 1, 2, 404895) All to carry on the thirteenfold constructive programme and some select few to offer C.D. in addition.
('81', 250, 1, 3, 404998) C.D. is a mighty weapon to be wielded effectively by only a few in the first instance.
('81', 250, 1, 4, 405085) Constructive programme is to be worked by all Congressmen and even non Congressmen if they will.
('81', 250, 1, 5, 405182) How can people shut their eyes to its paramount importance?
('81', 250, 1, 6, 405242) Even parliamentary programme without it is a mere farce.
('81', 250, 1, 7, 405299) We have had it till 1920. I do not deny its usefulness even as a farce is useful.
('81', 250, 1, 8, 405381) But there is no such thing as a farce without the backing of a play.
('81', 250, 1, 9, 405450) In 1920 the nation came into its own.
('81', 250, 1, 10, 405488) Constructive programme was described in so many words to be a preparation for C. D. Parliamentary programme was given up in toto.
('81', 250, 1, 11, 405618) The nation lost nothing by it.
('81', 250, 1, 12, 405649) Parliamentary programme will have its definite place when we have a parliament of our own.
('81', 250, 1, 13, 405740) Let it not be forgotten that this is expected to be a fight to the finish.
('81', 250, 1, 14, 405815) It is true that C. D. will be suspended if genuine free speech is granted.
('81', 250, 1, 15, 405890) If we do not find ourselves free at the end of the war, resumption will be a certainty.
('81', 250, 1, 16, 405978) But that is idle speculation.
('81', 250, 1, 17, 406008) If we do our present duty, whatever the circumstances that face us at the end of the war we shall be found ready.
('81', 250, 1, 18, 406122) Let me glance at the constructive programme.
('81', 250, 1, 19, 406167) There is communal unity.
('81', 250, 1, 20, 406192) It is worth much more than the whole parliamentary programme.
('81', 250, 1, 21, 406254) Without it, the latter is useless.
('81', 250, 1, 22, 406289) It becomes a field for interminable wrangling.
('81', 250, 1, 23, 406336) Complete heart unity takes us almost straightway to independence.
('81', 250, 1, 24, 406402) Let me not be told that there will be no unity at all or not in our lifetime.
('81', 250, 1, 25, 406480) I must refuse to believe the negation so long as there are some Congressmen working for unity.
('81', 250, 1, 26, 406575) If the Congress cannot, I know that no other institution can.
('81', 250, 1, 27, 406637) For every Congressman whatever his faith must equally represent in his own person every Indian, no matter what his faith is.
('81', 250, 1, 28, 406762) In that sense he belongs to all religions.
('81', 250, 1, 29, 406805) Then take untouchability.
('81', 250, 1, 30, 406831) I repeat that if untouchability lives, Hinduism and with it India dies.
('81', 250, 1, 31, 406903) Is that not a programme worth living for, dying for?
('81', 250, 1, 32, 406956) And the spinning wheel whose every turn brings India nearer her destiny?
('81', 250, 1, 33, 407029) Surely it can fully occupy every day of every Congressman.
('81', 250, 1, 34, 407088) And the wheel being the centre of our solar system it includes all the planets in the shape of village industries.
('81', 250, 1, 35, 407203) The wheel brings us at once to the emancipation of Indias
('81', 251, 0, 1, 407261) 252 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 251, 1, 2, 407303) manhood, kisans, labourers and all those who are weary and heavy laden.
('81', 251, 1, 3, 407375) If this all inclusive and mighty programme is not understood and appreciated by Congressmen they do not know the A B C of non violence nor do they know the elements of C.D. This programme gives ample scope for public meetings, demonstrations, exhibitions and the like.
('81', 251, 1, 4, 407644) No official Congress Committees need function for co ordinating these activities.
('81', 251, 1, 5, 407726) Wherever five earnest Congressmen are found, they can group together and organize them.
('81', 251, 1, 6, 407814) Congress will now see why I contemplate no change in the programme as it is going and why I am full of hope for the future of the country.

('81', 255, 9, 13, 412742) DEAR IDIOT, It was a tragedy about Raghuvansh.
('81', 255, 9, 14, 412789) I had asked P[rabhavati] to write for you.
('81', 255, 9, 15, 412832) She thought it was for me.

('81', 257, 10, 19, 415156) I am generally averse to hunger strikes by prisoners but I cannot help recognizing that at times they have no other honourable recourse for the redress of grievances.
('81', 257, 10, 20, 415323) It is cruel for the Government to say that they will not consider grievances unless the strike is given up.
('81', 257, 10, 21, 415431) It is tantamount to saying that the sufferers should not suffer for the redress of wrongs done to them.
('81', 257, 10, 22, 415535) I should have thought a responsive Government would all the more readily listen to appeals of the wronged when they are accompanied by self inflicted suffering.

('81', 259, 11, 23, 418098) Although I have devoted a large part of my life to the study of religion and to discussion with religious leaders of all faiths, I know very well that I cannot but seem presumptuous in writing about Jesus Christ and trying to explain what He means to me.
('81', 259, 11, 24, 418353) I do so only because my Christian friends have told me on more than a few occasions that for the very reason that I am not a Christian and that (I
('81', 259, 12, 25, 418500) 1 The source reproduced this from Inner Culture.
('81', 259, 12, 26, 418549) The date of the writing, however, is not available.
('81', 260, 0, 1, 418601) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 261
('81', 260, 1, 2, 418648) shall quote their words exactly) I do not accept Christ in the bottom of my heart as the only Son of God, it is impossible for me to understand the profound significance of His teachings, or to know and interpret the greatest source of spiritual strength that man has ever known.
('81', 260, 1, 3, 418928) Although this may or may not be true in my case, I have reasons to believe that it is an erroneous point of view.
('81', 260, 1, 4, 419042) I believe that such an estimate is incompatible with the message that Jesus Christ gave to the world.
('81', 260, 1, 5, 419144) For he was, certainly, the highest example of one who wished to give everything asking nothing in return, and not caring what creed might happen to be professed by the recipient.
('81', 260, 1, 6, 419323) I am sure that if He were living here now among men, He would bless the lives of many who perhaps have never even heard His name, if only their lives embodied the virtues of which He was a living example on earth; the virtues of loving ones neighbour as oneself and of doing good and charitable works among ones fellow men.
('81', 260, 1, 7, 419647) What, then, does Jesus mean to me?
('81', 260, 1, 8, 419682) To me He was one of the greatest teachers humanity has ever had.
('81', 260, 1, 9, 419747) To His believers He was Gods only begotten Son.
('81', 260, 1, 10, 419795) Could the fact that I do or do not accept this belief make Jesus have any more or less influence in my life?
('81', 260, 1, 11, 419904) Is all the grandeur of His teaching and of His doctrine to be forbidden to me?
('81', 260, 1, 12, 419983) I cannot believe so.
('81', 260, 1, 13, 420004) To me it implies a spiritual birth.
('81', 260, 1, 14, 420040) My interpretation, in other words, is that in Jesus own life is the key of His nearness to God; that He expressed, as no other could, the spirit and will of God.
('81', 260, 1, 15, 420202) It is in this sense that I see Him and recognize Him as the Son of God.
('81', 260, 1, 16, 420274) But I do believe that something of this spirit, that Jesus exemplified in the highest measure in its most profound human sense, does exist.
('81', 260, 1, 17, 420414) I must believe this; if I do not believe it I should be a scep tic; and to be a sceptic is to live a life that is empty and lacks moral content.
('81', 260, 1, 18, 420559) Or, what is the same thing, to condemn the entire human race to a negative end.
('81', 260, 1, 19, 420639) It is true that there certainly is reason for scepticism when one observes the bloody butchery that European aggressors have un loosed, and when one thinks about the misery and suffering prevalent in every corner of the world, as well as the pestilence and famine that always follow, terribly and inevitably, upon war.
('81', 260, 1, 20, 420958) In the face of this, how can one speak seriously of the divine spirit incarnate in man?
('81', 260, 1, 21, 421046) Because these acts of terror and murder offend the conscience of man; because man knows that they represent evil; because in the inner depths of his heart and of his mind, he deplores them.
('81', 260, 1, 22, 421236) And because, moreover, when he does not go astray,
('81', 261, 0, 1, 421287) 262 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 261, 1, 2, 421329) misled by false teachings or corrupted by false leaders, man has within his breast an impulse for good and a compassion that is the spark of divinity, and which some day, I believe, will burst forth into the full flower that is the hope of all mankind.
('81', 261, 1, 3, 421582) An example of this flowering may be found in the figure and in the life of Jesus.
('81', 261, 1, 4, 421664) I refuse to believe that there now exists or has ever existed a person that has not made use of His example to lessen his sins, even though he may have done so without realizing it.
('81', 261, 1, 5, 421846) The lives of all have, in some greater or lesser degree, been changed by His presence, His actions, and the words spoken by His divine voice.
('81', 261, 1, 6, 421988) I believe that it is impossible to estimate the merits of the various religions of the world, and moreover I believe that it is unnecessary and harmful even to attempt it.
('81', 261, 1, 7, 422160) But each one of them, in my judg ment, embodies a common motivating force : the desire to uplift mans life and give it purpose.
('81', 261, 1, 8, 422288) And because the life of Jesus has the significance and the transcendency to which I have alluded, I believe that He belongs not solely to Christianity, but to the entire world; to all races and people, it matters little under what flag, name or doctrine they may work, profess a faith, or worship a god inherited from their ancestors.

('81', 263, 10, 22, 425623) So when you come, I shall believe that you have.
('81', 263, 10, 23, 425672) I am glad you will be leaving with S. It is well he will have his full measure of pleasure.
('81', 263, 10, 24, 425764) The weather also will be cooler still by the time you return.
('81', 263, 10, 25, 425826) Poor Prabha !!
('81', 263, 10, 26, 425841) You are over sensitive.
('81', 263, 10, 27, 425865) Your translation is good so far as style goes.
('81', 263, 10, 28, 425912) I have simply remarked upon the looseness of thought.
('81', 263, 10, 29, 425966) 2 Even if it is loose in the original, the translator has to make it definite.
('81', 263, 10, 30, 426045) It is a difficult thing but it has to be done.
('81', 263, 10, 31, 426092) But it cannot be done if you

('81', 264, 5, 9, 426482) MY DEAR SATIN 1, I have your letter.
('81', 264, 5, 10, 426519) We have to do the best we can with the help we can get by dint of Service.
('81', 264, 5, 11, 426594) The Society was right.
('81', 264, 5, 12, 426617) I can only distribute relief in accordance with the wishes of the donors.
('81', 264, 5, 13, 426691) Of course it could reject those donations.
('81', 264, 5, 14, 426734) But that would be foolish.
('81', 264, 5, 15, 426761) We can try and get donations for the needy Mussalmans.
('81', 264, 5, 16, 426816) It may be difficult at the present time.
('81', 264, 5, 17, 426857) Then we must be content with what personal help we can render.
('81', 264, 5, 18, 426920) It would be wrong for me to send money from here even if I can collect some.
('81', 264, 5, 19, 426997) What you can command locally and by local effort would be solid service.
('81', 264, 5, 20, 427070) We must learn the secret of rendering service without money and without fuss.
('81', 264, 5, 21, 427148) Money is often a hindrance.

('81', 264, 8, 26, 427340) How small minded you are !
('81', 264, 8, 27, 427367) Not a trace of generosity.
('81', 264, 8, 28, 427394) And no limit to suspiciousness?
('81', 264, 8, 29, 427426) Who writes to Saraswati 3?
('81', 264, 8, 30, 427453) I inquire and learn whatever I can regarding you.
('81', 264, 8, 31, 427503) Nor is it that I do not reply to your letters.
('81', 264, 8, 32, 427550) And, apart from pointing out your errors to you, what else need I do?
('81', 264, 8, 33, 427620) What Ba wrote was based on experience.
('81', 264, 8, 34, 427659) But let it be.
('81', 264, 8, 35, 427674) I have written even this merely to explain your error to you.
('81', 264, 8, 36, 427736) Kishorelalbhai also wrote his letter at my instance.
('81', 264, 8, 37, 427789) I myself wished to write, but afterwards, to save my time, I asked him to do so.

('81', 265, 5, 7, 428350) I understand about Ba.
('81', 265, 5, 8, 428373) Bas case is difficult.
('81', 265, 5, 9, 428396) What you write about me is unnecessary.
('81', 265, 5, 10, 428436) I am trying my very best to abide by everything you say.

('81', 265, 5, 16, 428783) I am sure if you were present here, you would have brought it under control more effectively.
('81', 265, 5, 17, 428877) So, pass your examination and come down.
('81', 265, 5, 18, 428918) I like your self confidence.
('81', 265, 5, 19, 428947) But it must be backed by an equal measure of reading.
('81', 265, 5, 20, 429001) Suggest something for Sardar if you think it necessary.
('81', 265, 5, 21, 429057) I give him a diet of soup of leafy vegetables and honey.

('81', 265, 10, 30, 429356) The depressed classes question is very complicated.
('81', 265, 10, 31, 429408) It transcends politics.
('81', 265, 10, 32, 429432) If enough money cannot be raised for our conference it should be postponed.
('81', 265, 10, 33, 429508) How much can you get with my help?
('81', 265, 10, 34, 429543) It will be more befitting if you make do with whatever you can collect on your own.

('81', 270, 13, 21, 435620) It amounts to this that the teeth for show and for chewing are different.
('81', 270, 13, 22, 435694) And what a poisonous criticism of the Congress of which you are a member?
('81', 270, 13, 23, 435768) If the Congress is as you believe it to be, what is the good of your continuing to be a member of the same?
('81', 270, 13, 24, 435876) Your justification of the Congress policy at present appears to be a favour on it from a high position.

STATEMENT ON INDO CEYLONESE PACT WARDHA, November 11, 1941 The proposed Indo Ceylonese Pact 1 is not open to the fatal objections that have been universally raised against the Indo Burman thing, 2 which was sprung upon an unsuspecting public as an almost settled fact.
('81', 284, 6, 21, 454598) What has come from Ceylon is a proposal for examination by the Government and the public.
('81', 284, 6, 22, 454688) I have studied the relevant papers as much as possible.
('81', 284, 6, 23, 454744) On merits, the Ceylon proposal is open to objection in the same manner as the Burman.
('81', 284, 6, 24, 454830) I suggest to Ceylon Ministers that there is no reason whatsoever for hurry.
('81', 284, 6, 25, 454906) Adjustment can easily be made about the supply of labour, but wholesale legislation may be left over till after the war.
('81', 284, 6, 26, 455027) The war is a terrible tragedy, the like of which is unknown to history.
('81', 284, 6, 27, 455099) But the tragedy will be deeper still, if at the end we find

('81', 285, 1, 2, 455640) ourselves living the old way without radical changes in every walk of life.
('81', 285, 1, 3, 455716) Let me recall here the goodwill mission that was sent by the Congress in July 1939 in the person of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.
('81', 285, 1, 4, 455841) It had created a deep impression upon the Singhalese and their Minis ters.
('81', 285, 1, 5, 455916) It was hoped that the good seed sown by our ambassador would fructify.
('81', 285, 1, 6, 455987) When the Ceylon deputation came to India in November last, it was arranged that they would meet him in Allahabad.
('81', 285, 1, 7, 456101) But he was arrested before they could meet.
('81', 285, 1, 8, 456145) Jawaharlal had prepared a note for them.
('81', 285, 1, 9, 456186) It will be published, if I find it necessary to do so.
('81', 285, 1, 10, 456241) My object in recalling the mission and the attempt made thereafter is to point out the way to lasting peace and brotherliness between Ceylon and India.
('81', 285, 1, 11, 456393) It is unthinkable that Burma, Ceylon and India should distrust one another or regard the presence of their nationals among their neighbours as antagonistic to one another.
('81', 285, 1, 12, 456565) Any harmful migration from one country to the other may surely be regulated by voluntary adjustment without much legal inter ference.
('81', 285, 1, 13, 456699) I feel somehow that no harm has accrued to Ceylon by the settlement of Indians there.
('81', 285, 1, 14, 456785) As elsewhere, Indian merchants and pro fessionals had followed in the wake of labour imported wholly for the benefit of Ceylon.
('81', 285, 1, 15, 456913) Sir Edward Jacksons report, I understand, clearly shows that Indian emigration to Ceylon has done no harm to the indigenous population.
('81', 285, 1, 16, 457049) But, if my plea for patient waiting falls on deaf ears, I suggest much the same thing that I have suggested for Burma.
('81', 285, 1, 17, 457168) I should have no difficulty in persuading experienced legislators that in legislation affecting men in the street and addressed to the masses the simplest and shortest method is best.
('81', 285, 1, 18, 457352) I, therefore, suggest that the whole of the Indian population found in Ceylon on a given date (kept secret) should be registered and clothed with full rights of citizenship.
('81', 285, 1, 19, 457526) Those who may be outside Ceylon but who can unquestionably be proved to be bona fide residents of Ceylon should also be registered on application.
('81', 285, 1, 20, 457673) This procedure obviates the intricacies which permeate the proposal under examination.
('81', 285, 1, 21, 457760) The term domicile should find no place in such legislation.
('81', 285, 1, 22, 457820) The English law of domicile is the worst possible.
('81', 285, 1, 23, 457871) Judges have been known to have been confused over the interpretation of the term.
('81', 285, 1, 24, 457953) Human liberty is a precious thing, which must not be trifled with by legal subtleties and interminable wranglings in courts of law.
('81', 285, 1, 25, 458085) The wrangling attains no dignity, because it takes place in a law court.
('81', 285, 1, 26, 458158) Men should know definitely where they stand in given circumstances.

('81', 286, 1, 2, 458273) So far as labour is concerned, I have no doubt that Ceylon should have the sole right to import as much as it likes under contracts easily to be understood and mutually agreed to between the two Governments.
('81', 286, 1, 3, 458481) The suggested quota system should have no place in an honourable understanding.

('81', 287, 6, 15, 459640) 511. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS WARDHAGANJ, November 12, 1941 I observe that there is a move to press the Government to release satyagrahi prisoners.
('81', 287, 6, 16, 459786) It is, perhaps, appropriate to mention that so far as I know there will be on the part of the Congress neither appreciation of nor response to any such gesture by the Government.
('81', 287, 6, 17, 459965) Those who may be discharged will have to be invited to re offer civil disobedience if they are physically fit.
('81', 287, 6, 18, 460076) Moreover, there will be great resentment if distinction is made between satyagrahis and those who are detained without trial.
('81', 287, 6, 19, 460202) The Government should not be judges of what is reasonable.
('81', 287, 6, 20, 460261) What the public demand is this : Let the Government keep the prisoners, but give decent treatment to the prisoners whether they hunger strike or not.
('81', 287, 6, 21, 460411) They need not take notice of such strikes when there is no reasonable cause for that.
('81', 287, 6, 22, 460497) The Deoli prisoners demands as far as they are known are just.
('81', 287, 6, 23, 460560) Let them end the terrible suspense by granting the demands and ending the hunger strike.

('81', 291, 7, 26, 465992) May do what you can outside.
('81', 291, 7, 27, 466021) Do not send Prabhavati.
('81', 291, 7, 28, 466045) I have heard nothing as yet from Sardar Mangal Singh.
('81', 291, 7, 29, 466099) shall, no doubt, do so in due course.
('81', 291, 7, 30, 466137) But the matter is too urgent to brook delay.
('81', 291, 7, 31, 466182) I have heard that Shri Jayaprakash has lost heavily in weight.
('81', 291, 7, 32, 466245) Forcible feeding can only be a temporary makeshift.
('81', 291, 7, 33, 466297) Shri Jayaprakash is one of the most determined of workers.
('81', 291, 7, 34, 466356) I flatter myself with the belief that if anything could have melted him our joint telegram should have.
('81', 291, 7, 35, 466460) His preventing his wife from going to him is ominous.
('81', 291, 7, 36, 466514) He wants no interference, emotional or other, with his decision.

('81', 292, 0, 1, 466651) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 293
('81', 292, 1, 2, 466698) So far as I can see, there is no political motive behind this hunger strike.
('81', 292, 1, 3, 466775) The refusal to consider the case until the hunger strike is given up is a cruel joke.
('81', 292, 1, 4, 466861) It would be an act of inhumanity if Shri Jayaprakash and his fellow detenus are detained till their lives are in danger.
('81', 292, 1, 5, 466982) I appeal to the Government, in the name or humanity, forthwith to grant the request of the detenus.
('81', 292, 1, 6, 467082) The plea of ascertaining and carrying out the wishes of the Provincial Governments is irrele vant and untenable.
('81', 292, 1, 7, 467195) The Central Government is in no way bound to oblige the Provincial Governments in matters where the life and liberty of the citizen is involved.
('81', 292, 1, 8, 467340) There must be something radically wrong if the Provincial Governments are afraid to keep their own detenus within their borders.
('81', 292, 1, 9, 467469) This continuing hunger strike shows the futility of discharging civil resistance prisoners who have themselves sought imprisonment.
('81', 292, 1, 10, 467601) With what face can they come out when those who have not sought imprisonment are detained without trial and are hunger striking for the minimum of conveniences to which every human being is entitled?

('81', 292, 4, 15, 467930) I understand about you.
('81', 292, 4, 16, 467954) Khersaheb and I were so busy, each with his own affairs, that we could meet only for a few minutes.
('81', 292, 4, 17, 468054) I therefore forgot to talk to him about you.
('81', 292, 4, 18, 468099) I will now write to him and inquire.
('81', 292, 4, 19, 468136) The plan for the building was sent by Chimanlalbhai at the Mani Bhuvan address.
('81', 292, 4, 20, 468216) If you have received it, let him know your decision about it.
('81', 292, 4, 21, 468278) About Ratubhai I believe that you should go and fetch him and keep him with you.
('81', 292, 4, 22, 468359) Let him have the taste of brotherly love.
('81', 292, 4, 23, 468401) When you come here, you will of course bring him along with you.
('81', 292, 4, 24, 468466) If Champa arrives in December we shall see what can be done.
('81', 292, 4, 25, 468527) I agree with Manjus analysis.
('81', 292, 4, 26, 468557) I am glad that Munno often mentions Sevagram.
('81', 292, 4, 27, 468603) Only if the other children too feel the same way, will they enjoy staying here.

('81', 300, 10, 30, 479223) 540. HOW TO PAY THE EIGHT ANNA WAGE?
('81', 300, 11, 31, 479260) The satyagrahis as well as the others who have courted arrest are spinning a lot during the present movement.
('81', 300, 11, 32, 479370) I am receiving news from all the prisons that spinning is going on with great enthusiasm and interest.
('81', 300, 11, 33, 479473) For me this is heartening news.
('81', 300, 11, 34, 479505) It may be said that Shri Dhirendra Majumdar is a paragon among the prisoners.
('81', 300, 11, 35, 479583) He spins himself, makes others spin and has been deeply pondering over the methods of improving the charkha.
('81', 300, 11, 36, 479692) I have received a letter from him
('81', 301, 0, 1, 479726) 302 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 301, 1, 2, 479768) which deserves serious consideration.
('81', 301, 1, 3, 479806) I am, therefore, reproducing it below for the benefit of khadi lovers.
('81', 301, 2, 4, 479877) This scheme seeks to realine the dream of paying the spinners and ultimately all labourers, i.e., craftsmen, eight annas for an eight hour day.
('81', 301, 2, 5, 480021) It does not attempt to give everyone everything here and now.
('81', 301, 2, 6, 480083) But the attempt is to show that all this can be achieved within ten years.
('81', 301, 2, 7, 480158) Bhai Dhirendra does not express a definite opinion on the scheme but seeks the opinion and comments of other experts.
('81', 301, 2, 8, 480276) Maybe he does not have in the prison all the necessary literature on the subject.
('81', 301, 2, 9, 480358) About the scheme at the moment I can only say that all khadi workers should examine it and experiment in this direction.
('81', 301, 2, 10, 480479) Small experiments need almost no capital.
('81', 301, 2, 11, 480521) For exapmle, training ten or twenty spinners and a few teachers and keeping a record of the results should not involve much expenditure.
('81', 301, 2, 12, 480658) The chief merit of the scheme lies in its being almost self supporting.
('81', 301, 2, 13, 480730) It consists of two parts.
('81', 301, 2, 14, 480756) It does lay a little burden on the institution in the form of enhanced wages.
('81', 301, 2, 15, 480834) But the other half deals with payment to the spinners after training them for higher produc tion.
('81', 301, 2, 16, 480932) Another merit of the scheme is the attempt at all round reform in the spinners lives.
('81', 301, 2, 17, 481018) I attach importance to the scheme from this point of view.
('81', 301, 2, 18, 481077) This scheme is not the handiwork of an ignorant khadi lover but has been thought out by a responsible and practical worker.
('81', 301, 2, 19, 481201) Dhirendra Babu is not merely the author of this scheme.
('81', 301, 2, 20, 481257) He is himself going to implement it.
('81', 301, 2, 21, 481294) Every experimenter in the field should remember that the scheme takes into consideration all the processes from cotton growing to weaving.

('81', 301, 3, 23, 481501) 1 The letter is not translated here.
('81', 301, 3, 24, 481538) Dhirendra Majumdar had outlined a scheme to implement Gandhijis suggestion, made four years earlier, that every village craftsman should get one anna for an hours honest labour.
('81', 301, 3, 25, 481716) The scheme which involved social as well as economic reform visualized an immediate beginning in a small area and its gradual extension in ten years.

('81', 305, 11, 28, 486844) Who would not be glad at the election of a scholar like you?
('81', 305, 11, 29, 486905) But I must confess that I was sad, too; because I had, in the interest of work, wanted Rajendra Babu to be the President this year.
('81', 305, 11, 30, 487037) That is why Seth Jamnalal Bajaj proposed the name of Rajendra Babu.
('81', 305, 11, 31, 487105) You are of course aware that I have been closely associated with the Sammelan for many years.
('81', 305, 11, 32, 487199) I had a hand in framing the policy of the Sammelan towards propagation of Hindi.
('81', 305, 11, 33, 487280) It has developed some
('81', 306, 0, 1, 487302) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 307
('81', 306, 1, 2, 487349) political overones too.
('81', 306, 1, 3, 487373) I shall not be able to attend the Sammelan.
('81', 306, 1, 4, 487417) Hence myself and a few friends thought that the election of Rajendra Babu would safeguard the interests of the Sammelan.
('81', 306, 1, 5, 487538) But this did not happen.
('81', 306, 1, 6, 487563) Now all my hopes rest on you.
('81', 306, 1, 7, 487593) I hope to secure your help in what I had expected from Rajendra Babu.
('81', 306, 1, 8, 487663) It will be common ground between you and me that all of us should endeavour to do our best, keeping in view the accommodating attitude of Tandonji 1 who is the soul of the Sammelan, and all the other things we know he stands for.
('81', 306, 1, 9, 487893) I do not know whether or no you approve of the policy adopted at Indore 2 and Nagpur 3. Some attempts were made at Poona to change that policy.
('81', 306, 1, 10, 488037) The attempts did succeed to some extent.
('81', 306, 1, 11, 488078) I do not how ever regard these changes as intolerable.
('81', 306, 1, 12, 488133) But further steps in that direction will become unbearable for persons like me.
('81', 306, 1, 13, 488213) My efforts would be to move a step further than at Nagpur.
('81', 306, 1, 14, 488272) I am convinced this would secure the progress of Hindi and the welfare of the nation.
('81', 306, 1, 15, 488358) Hindi Urdu controversy should not have been started nor should it be continued.
('81', 306, 1, 16, 488438) There have been sharp differences about the Wardha office.
('81', 306, 1, 17, 488497) That office must be subordinate to the Sammelan but I think it should have as much autonomy as the Madras office.
('81', 306, 1, 18, 488611) If it is agreed that the Wardha office has well served the cause of Hindi, it should, I think, enjoy greater autonomy than it has today.
('81', 306, 1, 19, 488748) Rajendra Babus presence at the Sammelan is uncertain.
('81', 306, 1, 20, 488802) He cannot stand the December weather of the Punjab.
('81', 306, 1, 21, 488854) Nor can Seth Jamnalalji go.
('81', 306, 1, 22, 488882) Kakasaheb Kalelkar and Acharya Shriman Narayan may go.
('81', 306, 1, 23, 488937) Please lend your ear to them.
('81', 306, 1, 24, 488967) I wish there should be no conflicts at the Sammelan nor any meaningless controversy.
('81', 306, 1, 25, 489052) If there are differences on principles, let them be expressed in a friendly spirit.
('81', 306, 1, 26, 489136) Therefore I would request you, if you can spare the time, to come here for a day so that all of us can meet and talk things over.
('81', 306, 1, 27, 489266) Rajendra Babu and Jamnalalji are here for the time being.
('81', 306, 1, 28, 489324) If you cannot come for want of time or for other reasons, I can send Kakasaheb and

('81', 312, 12, 25, 495991) You pleaded inability to get on with the Bengal workers.
('81', 312, 12, 26, 496048) You wanted to come to Sevagram.

('81', 313, 1, 8, 496963) Let Dhirenda say what he thinks of it.
('81', 313, 1, 9, 497002) It is a serious thing for you to harbour the wrong against me and be satisfied that all is well.
('81', 313, 1, 10, 497099) Of course if you harbour any wrong against me, your wife cannot help it.
('81', 313, 1, 11, 497172) And it is but natural that she cannot send Abha to such a man as me.
('81', 313, 1, 12, 497241) I hope this letter will clear all your doubts.
('81', 313, 1, 13, 497288) If it does not, you should pursue the inquiry till you convince me of my error or are yourself convinced of doing wrong to me in thinking as you do.
('81', 313, 1, 14, 497437) You are wrong about Sailen.
('81', 313, 1, 15, 497465) He is not going to help Rishabhdas but the latter is willing for my sake to take him up.
('81', 313, 1, 16, 497554) Had you not been in need of money, I might not have sent Sailen.
('81', 313, 1, 17, 497619) S[ailen] too likes the job.

('81', 313, 4, 20, 497739) SEVAGRAM November 25, 1941
('81', 313, 5, 21, 497766) MY DEAR SULTANA, I was delighted to have your letter.
('81', 313, 5, 22, 497820) The four propositions you have laid down with the approval of the Maulvi Sahib are sound.
('81', 313, 5, 23, 497910) But how to secure universal acceptance for them is the question.
('81', 313, 5, 24, 497975) They form a basis for join action.
('81', 313, 5, 25, 498010) If you have been able to assure Maulvi Sahib of my bona fides the next step for us is to meet and discuss the ways and means.
('81', 313, 5, 26, 498136) If he can take the trouble to come here, this is a good time.
('81', 313, 5, 27, 498198) Dr. Rajendra Prasad too is here.
('81', 313, 5, 28, 498231) 1 You will ascertain his wish and let me know.
('81', 313, 5, 29, 498278) As to the fifth proposition I have doubts.
('81', 313, 5, 30, 498321) It demands clarifi cation and mutual discussions.

('81', 314, 1, 5, 498538) Did you not take with you that book on women?
('81', 314, 1, 6, 498584) I miss it on the shelf.

('81', 314, 4, 13, 498871) I cannot have even the slightest respite from work.
('81', 314, 4, 14, 498923) I think I am very well.

('81', 314, 8, 26, 499327) There is no harm at all in going to Mathura, etc.
('81', 314, 8, 27, 499377) Bow in front of the temples from outside.
('81', 314, 8, 28, 499419) I have not visited any of those temples.
('81', 314, 8, 29, 499460) How can we, through mere curiosity, visit a place which is not open to Harijans?
('81', 314, 8, 30, 499541) You should not, therefore, enter the temples.

('81', 315, 2, 3, 499851) November 26, 1941
('81', 315, 3, 4, 499869) SUSHILA, I have your letter after many days.
('81', 315, 3, 5, 499914) It will hurt me if you do not write from sheer lethargy.
('81', 315, 3, 6, 499971) The thought that your studies are getting disturbed is unbearable.
('81', 315, 3, 7, 500038) You may well pass in the examination, but your studies being disturbed without cause can only result in harm.
('81', 315, 3, 8, 500148) Whether it is Satya or any other friend who comes, your studies must not be interrupted.
('81', 315, 3, 9, 500237) I wish you would abandon the idea of living elsewhere and stick to Puris.
('81', 315, 3, 10, 500311) I would change my view if you found a more comfor table place than Puris.
('81', 315, 3, 11, 500385) But I prefer Puris house.
('81', 315, 3, 12, 500411) Once we take a decision we should not change it all of a sudden.
('81', 315, 3, 13, 500476) You cannot also change the decision to get away for three months.
('81', 315, 3, 14, 500542) It does have its advantages.
('81', 315, 3, 15, 500571) Why worry about the loss of pay?
('81', 315, 3, 16, 500604) Surely you are not going to stick to the salary.
('81', 315, 3, 17, 500653) No, you must not change the three month decision.
('81', 315, 3, 18, 500703) I had a dream only yesterday that you are sure to get your M. D.; that you are extremely talented and have been offered a salary of three or four hundred rupees for a couple of years merely to ena ble you to enhance your knowledge; I had to take a decision and I could not arrive at any and then I woke up to find that there was neither any offer nor did I have to take any decision.

('81', 315, 6, 24, 501297) 570. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS WARDHAGANJ, November 27, 1941 The discontinuance of the hunger strike by the Deoli detenus relieves the terrible tension under which the public was labouring.
('81', 315, 6, 25, 501484) It was not possible to contemplate with unconcern the starvation, even self inflicted, of patriots, whether one agreed with their method or not.
('81', 316, 0, 1, 501629) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 317
('81', 316, 1, 2, 501676) Let us hope that repatriation will be hastened and their treatment will not be worsened for their removal to their respective provinces.
('81', 316, 1, 3, 501813) I have read the Government communique describing the bewitching life in Deoli.
('81', 316, 1, 4, 501892) I recall a similar description of life in the Andamans.
('81', 316, 1, 5, 501948) It read like a fairy tale and yet most of the inmates preferred to return home.
('81', 316, 1, 6, 502028) These descriptions, however truthful they may be in the estimation of the writers not themsleves detenus, do not answer the reality as the detenus see it.
('81', 316, 1, 7, 502183) The object of the communique, on the face of it, is to show that the condition in Deoli was superior to what it was in the respective provinces.
('81', 316, 1, 8, 502328) If such was the case, it shows how correct and proper was the demand of the hunger strikers that their condition on repatriation should be no worse than in Deoli.
('81', 316, 1, 9, 502491) I should translate the demand thus : (1) Repatriation should not be to a remote godforsaken place in the detenus province.
('81', 316, 1, 10, 502614) The object of repatriation would be wholly frustrated if the detenus are transferred to a place far away from their homes.
('81', 316, 1, 11, 502737) (2) The conveniences and food should be as near to Deolis latest standard as possible.
('81', 316, 1, 12, 502824) That is so far as the prisoners demands are concerned.
('81', 316, 1, 13, 502879) But something more is needed.
('81', 316, 1, 14, 502909) Seeing that the detenus have not been tried, the burden is on the Government to give them as decent a treatment as possible.
('81', 316, 1, 15, 503034) War economy has no place in this connection, for detention is itself a war measure and could not be justified on any other ground.
('81', 316, 1, 16, 503165) Therefore, they are entitled to family allowance and travelling expenses for their families when necessary.
('81', 316, 1, 17, 503273) It should be remembered that most of the detenus are poor people.
('81', 316, 1, 18, 503339) So much as to Deoli.
('81', 316, 1, 19, 503360) But I feel that the question of food, sanitation and classification is and should be treated as an all India question.
('81', 316, 1, 20, 503479) I confine myself just now only to political prisoners, whether detenus detained on suspicion or satyagrahis who have courted imprisonment.
('81', 316, 1, 21, 503618) If I had the authority, I would treat all prisoners alike, making a distinction only on the ground of health and habit.
('81', 316, 1, 22, 503738) But I must not complicate the main issue by raising others [that] do not demand immediate solution.
('81', 316, 1, 23, 503838) I think that classifications should be scrapped.
('81', 316, 1, 24, 503887) At best they are arbitrary.
('81', 316, 1, 25, 503915) The scale prescribed in the very weighty and reasoned manifesto recently issued by eminent medical men representing the whole of India should be accepted forthwith as the minimum scale for all India, with such variations as staples grown in various provinces may demand.
('81', 316, 1, 26, 504186) All political prisoners should have the right to supplement their food and other requirements from their own pockets.
('81', 317, 0, 1, 504304) 318 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 317, 1, 2, 504346) All should be supplied with a selection of newspapers and magazines of known standing without any censoring.
('81', 317, 1, 3, 504455) There should be no restrictions as to choice of books.
('81', 317, 1, 4, 504510) What is not generally prohibited in India should be allowed to prisoners.
('81', 317, 1, 5, 504584) They should be allowed to write letters and receive visitors on the same scale as in B class.
('81', 317, 1, 6, 504678) It should be common cause that no recognition should be given to hunger strikes for wringing illegitimate concessions nor need they be penalized by refusal to consider legitimate demands on merits.
('81', 317, 1, 7, 504876) For a prisoner under stress, hunger strike is the last non violent remedy.
('81', 317, 1, 8, 504951) He seeks to end imposed suffering by self imposed suffering.
('81', 317, 1, 9, 505012) He thereby hopes to melt the heart of authority or at least enlist the sympathy of the public.
('81', 317, 1, 10, 505107) Experience shows that the method is not to be despised.
('81', 317, 1, 11, 505163) It has succeeded in several cases.
('81', 317, 1, 12, 505198) But it is not easy to know always whether the cause for which a strike is undertaken is valid.
('81', 317, 1, 13, 505293) We know, too, that Governments do not always come to a right decision in such cases.
('81', 317, 1, 14, 505378) I have before me the case of a prisoner, who has given up his strike at my instance.
('81', 317, 1, 15, 505463) The cause, as transpires in the record of the case before me, seems to have been more than valid.
('81', 317, 1, 16, 505561) The vegetables served contained a dead scorpion.
('81', 317, 1, 17, 505610) The men who had resorted to hunger strike are now being tried for breach of jail regulations in that they refused the food served.
('81', 317, 1, 18, 505741) There is the Chunar hunger strike now going on for a fortnight.
('81', 317, 1, 19, 505805) It is in respect of the treatment of C class prisoners.
('81', 317, 1, 20, 505861) I have wired pleading for its suspension.
('81', 317, 2, 21, 505903) I think that hunger strikes should not be regarded as a crime, but whenever such a strike takes place it should be referred to a judicial tribunal with the right to the prisoner to be represented by a lawyer of his choice.
('81', 317, 2, 22, 506126) If the cause is found to be valid, the grievance should be removed.
('81', 317, 2, 23, 506194) If the hunger strike is persisted in, although the finding is against the prisoner, the fast should be ignored.
('81', 317, 2, 24, 506306) If the procedure recommended by me is adopted the probability is that strikes will automatically decrease.
('81', 317, 2, 25, 506413) Where the cause is valid, the authorities will grant redress on a mere notice of hunger strike and where the strike is found to be unjustified there will be no public sympathy.
('81', 317, 2, 26, 506590) It follows that there would be no forcible feeding if the procedure I am recommending is adopted.
('81', 317, 2, 27, 506688) In rare and obstinate cases a life may have to be lost.
('81', 317, 2, 28, 506744) It is impossible always to prevent suicide, even by fasting.
('81', 317, 2, 29, 506805) Fasting has come to stay as a remedy for redress of grievances.
('81', 317, 2, 30, 506869) It has its uses.
('81', 317, 2, 31, 506886) An honest fast draws attention to a felt grievance and
('81', 317, 3, 32, 506941) 1 The telegram is not available.

('81', 318, 1, 3, 507038) What I have suggested is regularization of the huma nitarian instinct and the rescuing of a useful institution from ridicule or contempt.

('81', 319, 10, 23, 509378) Some of the guests sitting by my side sometimes take jaggery and sometimes do not.
('81', 319, 10, 24, 509461) Two children invariably take it.
('81', 319, 10, 25, 509494) It could be offered to other children also.
('81', 319, 10, 26, 509538) It is not common practice to offer jaggery.
('81', 319, 10, 27, 509582) Outsiders have complained that a lot of sweets are served here and the criticism is correct.
('81', 319, 10, 28, 509675) This may lead to some dissatisfaction; but you should face it and give your explanation.
('81', 319, 10, 29, 509764) Starch and jaggery have the same food value; but the processes of their digestion are different.
('81', 319, 10, 30, 509861) Starch has yet to be converted into jaggery.

('81', 320, 1, 2, 509953) Twig brushes can be cut only from babul or neem trees.
('81', 320, 1, 3, 510008) It is undoubtedly theft to cut them from trees not belonging to us.
('81', 320, 1, 4, 510076) We must get them from trees earmarked for us.
('81', 320, 1, 5, 510122) Tell this to B[alvantsinha] and select a tree or two.

('81', 320, 1, 7, 510231) Govindrao does not have the strength.
('81', 320, 1, 8, 510269) He is not idle, he is weak.
('81', 320, 1, 9, 510297) If a man dare not touch a scorpion, even though each of us can lift it with our hands, how can he be compelled to do so?
('81', 320, 1, 10, 510418) Govindrao is afraid of contracting leprosy.
('81', 320, 1, 11, 510462) This fear is not peculiar to him; many people have it.
('81', 320, 1, 12, 510517) This work, it is quite obvious, can be allotted only to a willing worker.
('81', 320, 1, 13, 510591) Cleaning of latrines should be completed before meals.
('81', 320, 1, 14, 510646) If that is not possible, let it be done at 2 in the afternoon.
('81', 320, 1, 15, 510709) This should be deci ded by common consent and from the point of view of hygiene.
('81', 320, 1, 16, 510790) Efforts are made to give advance intimation about guests.
('81', 320, 1, 17, 510848) Lanterns may be bought if necessary.

('81', 320, 1, 19, 510954) The contact with cities is inevitable.
('81', 320, 1, 20, 510993) We have to watch whether we earn in the cities or merely help in enabling the cities to exploit the villages.
('81', 320, 1, 21, 511103) Yes, we should try to reduce to the minimum contact with cities.
('81', 320, 1, 22, 511168) We have to create love for physical labour.
('81', 320, 1, 23, 511212) The difficulty is that guests outnumber regular inmates in the Ashram.
('81', 320, 1, 24, 511283) How can the guests be expected to labour?
('81', 320, 1, 25, 511325) Make a list of the regular inmates and you will be surprised to see how few we are.
('81', 320, 1, 26, 511409) I understand the reason for your not coming to me.
('81', 320, 1, 27, 511460) Do whatever is proper in respect of jawar.

('81', 321, 5, 9, 512191) I am glad you have written so frankly as you have done.
('81', 321, 5, 10, 512247) I am entirely at one with you that our relations with the Burmans ought to be of the most cordial character.
('81', 321, 5, 11, 512356) The corres pondence between the Prime Minister and me was naturally perfectly friendly on either side.
('81', 321, 5, 12, 512459) I myself love the Burmese people and as you know I had come in every close touch with the Phoongis.
('81', 321, 5, 13, 512559) What con crete steps can be taken at present I do not know.
('81', 321, 5, 14, 512619) I think the defects that I have pointed out in the Agreement 1 are real and they should be remedied.
('81', 321, 5, 15, 512720) You should, therefore, not give in on those points but try to remove those defects by friendly negotiation.
('81', 321, 5, 16, 512828) You ought not to take an attitude of opposition to your colleagues.
('81', 321, 5, 17, 512896) There is no occasion for it.
('81', 321, 5, 18, 512925) I am glad you have not expected me to go through your very long letter to Shri Satyamurti.
('81', 321, 5, 19, 513016) I tried to read it nevertheless but had to leave it for want of time.

('81', 322, 5, 10, 513825) Mr. Amery has said nothing new.
('81', 322, 5, 11, 513857) It is difficult for me to say anything more.
('81', 322, 5, 12, 513902) Mr. Amery holds certain views which he is entitled to hold.
('81', 322, 5, 13, 513962) But he does not know India as well as I do.
('81', 322, 5, 14, 514006) Therefore, I see that by repeating his statement, he is doing no good either to his own country or to India.
('81', 322, 5, 15, 514115) His repeating the same untruths would not convert untruth into truth.

('81', 322, 7, 18, 514261) DEAR BAPUJEE, Why did you give so much time to explain the wretched unfortunate incident?
('81', 322, 7, 19, 514351) If you had given me a line I should have been satisfied.
('81', 322, 7, 20, 514408) I sent you the papers because I did not want to have anything about you on my mind without your knowing it.
('81', 322, 7, 21, 514516) We may travel along different roads but my regard for you shall never suffer diminution.
('81', 322, 8, 22, 514605) 1 In a speech at Manchester on November 19, L. S. Amery, Secretary of State for India, said : We can be proud of Britains contribution to India.
('81', 322, 8, 23, 514750) What the Magna Carta won for us in the rights of the individual under the law, that we have given to India.
('81', 322, 8, 24, 514858) We have now set ourselves to achieve in co operation with Indian statesmanship the far greater miracle of building up within the space of a few years that superstructure of responsible freedom which we took centuries to complete.
('81', 322, 8, 25, 515088) In spite of suspicion we still retain the underlying goodwill and confidence in India.
('81', 322, 8, 26, 515175) But above all there is need of goodwill between Indians themselves.

('81', 323, 4, 9, 515608) But I suppose there is hardly an English family that has not to its credit such heavy sacrifice.

('81', 326, 5, 29, 520848) Let God, then, do as He wills.
('81', 326, 5, 30, 520879) You ought to like your solitary life.
('81', 326, 5, 31, 520917) That is a sign of a studious nature.
('81', 326, 5, 32, 520954) When one is going along the straight path there is no need to keep count of the days, for there is no other path to follow.
('81', 326, 5, 33, 521078) Prabhavati is leaving today.
('81', 326, 5, 34, 521107) She is going in order to meet Jayaprakash.
('81', 326, 5, 35, 521150) From there she will most probably go to Bihar.
('81', 326, 5, 36, 521197) Laksh mibai 1 arrived today.

('81', 327, 3, 5, 521722) So you can come when you wish.
('81', 327, 3, 6, 521753) I have to go to Bardoli on the 9th for one month.
('81', 327, 3, 7, 521803) So I would like you to come before the 9th.
('81', 327, 3, 8, 521847) I hope you are happy.

('81', 327, 7, 14, 522111) SUSHILA, I have your letter.
('81', 327, 7, 15, 522140) It is certainly sad about Sita 1, but you need not get frightened.
('81', 327, 7, 16, 522207) Such a thing could have happened here, too, though of course there would be less danger here.
('81', 327, 7, 17, 522301) It is clear that you cannot leave.
('81', 327, 7, 18, 522336) I think it is the duty of you both to spend your lives there.
('81', 327, 7, 19, 522398) You may bring up Sita there as best as you can.
('81', 327, 7, 20, 522446) If I brought her up, I would do so under my close personal supervision, as I did the four [brothers] and other [children].
('81', 327, 7, 21, 522569) I do not repent having done that.
('81', 327, 7, 22, 522603) According to me, they have lost nothing.
('81', 327, 7, 23, 522644) If Harilal went to school, etc., you see the result.
('81', 327, 7, 24, 522697) We cannot see the weaknesses of barristers and degree holders, for we are overawed by them.
('81', 327, 7, 25, 522789) In fact, there are many even among barristers and doctors who, like Harilal, lead immoral lives and are given to drinking.
('81', 327, 7, 26, 522912) But they are big men, holding degrees, and so their weaknesses are not noticed.
('81', 327, 7, 27, 522992) And, moreover, I myself condemned Harilal, and that also is one reason why he is on the streets.
('81', 327, 7, 28, 523089) It was my duty to denounce him, though I think denounce is not the right word in this context.
('81', 327, 7, 29, 523184) If, however, you are not convinced of the correctness of my advice, and if you can overcome your desire to keep Sita with you and she herself is willing, you may send her over and she will be educated in the

('81', 328, 1, 5, 523572) I can only advise you as a friend.
('81', 328, 1, 6, 523607) The right belongs to the parents alone, and it is their moral duty, too, to bring up their children in the way they think best.
('81', 328, 1, 7, 523735) Do ask Virjis son, too.
('81', 328, 1, 8, 523759) You need not feel awkward about it.
('81', 328, 1, 9, 523795) You did well, of course, to explain to Sita a womans function.
('81', 328, 1, 10, 523858) Instruction in regard to sex organs will do her nothing but good.
('81', 328, 1, 11, 523924) If the instruction is pure, the children will understand the right function of the organs and will learn self control.
('81', 328, 1, 12, 524043) Everything will depend on how the instruction is imparted.
('81', 328, 1, 13, 524102) You yourself should think over this matter.

('81', 332, 3, 4, 529586) BHAI SAMPURNANAND, I just got your letter.
('81', 332, 3, 5, 529629) Even before your letter arrived I had, in the course of a letter to a friend, stated that you were fully entitled to offer criticism.
('81', 332, 3, 6, 529763) It has had no adverse effect on me, although I main tain that there is absolutely no ground whatsoever for your criticism.
('81', 332, 3, 7, 529886) At the back of [the struggle for] freedom of speech there is [the claim for] independence as it was at the back of the Salt [Satyagraha].
('81', 332, 3, 8, 530024) But then this is a controversial subject.
('81', 332, 3, 9, 530066) Time will reveal everything.
('81', 332, 3, 10, 530095) That leaves the question of Hindi.
('81', 332, 3, 11, 530130) This controversy is meaning less and stems from ignorance.
('81', 332, 3, 12, 530189) No one in the Congress is antagonistic towards Hindi.
('81', 332, 3, 13, 530243) And no one will suspect me of such antagonism.
('81', 332, 3, 14, 530290) But I may differ in my policy [regarding Hindi].

('81', 332, 3, 17, 530486) I regard Urdu and the Persian script as included in Hindi.
('81', 332, 3, 18, 530545) I have been maintaining this view since the Indore [session].
('81', 332, 3, 19, 530607) The man responsible for giving to the national language the name Hindustani [and getting it] accepted by the Congress is Tandonji.
('81', 332, 3, 20, 530738) Now what can be done?
('81', 332, 3, 21, 530760) I think the resolution was all right.
('81', 332, 3, 22, 530798) And if it was so we should regard Hindustani as a synonym for Hindi.
('81', 332, 3, 23, 530867) Now tell me if there is anything wrong in it.
('81', 332, 3, 24, 530913) Rajendra Babu is not in a condition to go to Kashi.

('81', 333, 2, 3, 531410) WARDHAGANJ, December 4, 1941
('81', 333, 3, 4, 531439) In the course of an interview, this afternoon, on the Government of Indias communique 1 regarding the release of political prisoners, Mahatma Gandhi said : As I have said before the event, 2 I must repeat after the event, that, so far as I am concerned, it cannot evoke a single responsive or appreciative chord in me.
('81', 333, 3, 5, 531758) From my student days onward, I have been, and still claim to be, a friend of the British people.
('81', 333, 3, 6, 531855) But my friendship cannot blind me to the fact that British representatives hold India as a bondslave.
('81', 333, 3, 7, 531957) All the freedom that India enjoys is the freedom of a slave and not the freedom of an equal, which is otherwise known as Complete Indepen dence.
('81', 333, 3, 8, 532102) Mr. Amerys pronouncements do not soothe the festering sore, but are like sprinkling chillies on it.
('81', 333, 3, 9, 532202) It is in that setting that I am called upon to examine this release.
('81', 333, 3, 10, 532271) If the Government of India are confident of the determination of all responsible opinion in India to support the war effort, the logi cal conclusion would be to keep the civil disobedience prisoners in their custody, because they produce a jarring note.
('81', 333, 3, 11, 532525) The only meaning I can attach to the release, therefore, is that they expect that the prisoners will have changed their opinions in their self invited solitude.
('81', 333, 3, 12, 532686) I am hoping that the Government will be soon disillusioned.
('81', 333, 3, 13, 532746) Civil disobedience was not taken up without the most careful consideration.
('81', 333, 3, 14, 532822) It was certainly not taken up out of any vindictiveness.
('81', 333, 3, 15, 532879) It was taken up, and I hope will be continued, in order to make good the claim of the Congress to let the British people and the world know that there is, at the very least, a large body of public opinion represented by the Congress which is utterly opposed to participation in the war, not because it wishes any disaster to the British arms or
('81', 333, 4, 16, 533224) 1 Issued on December 3, 1941, which stated : The Government of India, confident in the determination of all responsible opinion in India to support the war effort until victory is secured, have reached the conclusion that those civil disobedience prisoners whose offences have been formal or symbolic in character, can be set free.
('81', 333, 4, 17, 533556) Effect will be given to this course as soon as possible.
('81', 333, 4, 18, 533613) There are provinces in which local conditions may mean delay; but before the end of the year the Government of India hope that throughout India practically all such persons will have been set free.
('81', 333, 4, 19, 533811) With them there will be released also Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. 2 Vide Statement to the Press, 12 11 1941.

('81', 334, 1, 2, 533992) victory to the Nazi or Fascist arms, but because it sees no deliverance from blood guiltiness either for the victor or for the vanquished, and certainly no deliverance for India out of this war.
('81', 334, 1, 3, 534187) The Congress, which seeks and claims to represent the dumb millions, has, for the past twenty years, accepted non violence as its unbroken policy to achieve Indias independence.
('81', 334, 1, 4, 534365) To stop civil disobedience, symbolic though it may be for the time being, will be to deny its policy at a crucial moment.
('81', 334, 1, 5, 534487) The Government claim that, in spite of the Congress efforts, they are able to get all the men and money from India.
('81', 334, 1, 6, 534603) Therefore the Congress opposition, in their estimate, can only be a moral effort and a moral demonstration.
('81', 334, 1, 7, 534711) I, for one, am entirely satisfied with it, because I am convinced that from that moral demonstration will arise, when the moment comes, a demonstration which will result in the attainment of Indias independence, not the ascendance of this party or that.
('81', 334, 1, 8, 534965) The Congress struggle covers every single unit in India.
('81', 334, 1, 9, 535022) Now that the Congress President 1 is expected to be out, it will be for him to consider whether and when to call the Congress Working Committee or the A. I. C. C. These two bodies will determine the future policy of the Congress.
('81', 334, 1, 10, 535252) I am but a humble instrument of service in conducting the civil disobedience.
('81', 334, 1, 11, 535330) I would, however, say one word about the detenus and other prisoners.
('81', 334, 1, 12, 535400) It sounds strange that those who have sought imprisonment are to be discharged and not those who are either detained without trial or imprisoned because they hold the freedom of their country dearer than their personal liberty.
('81', 334, 1, 13, 535628) There is surely something utterly wrong somewhere.
('81', 334, 1, 14, 535679) Therefore I cannot rejoice over the Government of Indias decision.

('81', 334, 2, 16, 535816) MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL, It is nice to be able to write to you outside the jail.
('81', 334, 2, 17, 535892) But the pleasure is only momentary for I cannot reconcile myself to these discharges.
('81', 334, 2, 18, 535978) However, we meet this new menace.
('81', 334, 2, 19, 536012) This is merely to tell you that I delayed answering your question as the rumour about your discharge was in the air.

('81', 335, 1, 2, 536189) I have read your letters most carefully.
('81', 335, 1, 3, 536230) I agree with your conclusions and I like the very generous manner in which you have treated the whole thing.
('81', 335, 1, 4, 536339) I had one and only one chat with F 1. and he accepted my proposition that he would not think of marrying Indu without your consent and blessing.
('81', 335, 1, 5, 536484) Indu wrote to J. that she was coming and seeing me too.
('81', 335, 1, 6, 536540) Now that you are out and probably will be for a few days if not longer, you will shape this thing as you wish.
('81', 335, 1, 7, 536651) I hope you have liked the recent statements issued by me.
('81', 335, 1, 8, 536709) You will tell me when you are coming.
('81', 335, 1, 9, 536747) Maulana 2 telephoned today saying he proposed to come after two or three days.
('81', 335, 1, 10, 536826) I propose to leave here on 9th for Bardoli for one month.
('81', 335, 1, 11, 536884) Sardar wants me to give one month to Gujarat.
('81', 335, 1, 12, 536930) He is under treatment, mostly dietetic.
('81', 335, 1, 13, 536970) I have prescribed the diet.
('81', 335, 1, 14, 536998) I think his pain is most bearable under that regime.
('81', 335, 1, 15, 537051) So far as it is possible our talks and meetings should take place in Bardoli.
('81', 335, 1, 16, 537129) The discharges are a challenge.
('81', 335, 1, 17, 537161) I feel that we should hold the W[orking] C[ommittee], A. I. C. C. meetings as early as we can.
('81', 335, 1, 18, 537256) But of this you and Maulana are the best judges.
('81', 335, 1, 19, 537305) I am writing this against time.

('81', 335, 5, 25, 537569) There is no question of your returning [to jail] immediately.
('81', 335, 5, 26, 537631) I am thinking [about it].
('81', 335, 5, 27, 537657) I am leaving for Bardoli on the 9th.
('81', 335, 5, 28, 537694) Go to Rajkot meanwhile and come to Bardoli after finishing your work there.
('81', 335, 5, 29, 537770) I will not be in a hurry to send you away from there.
('81', 335, 5, 30, 537824) I am fully satisfied with Lakshmibai.

I. C. C. which, the Government of India have been evidently induced to expect, will reverse the Bombay decision, whose working is reflected in my conduct of the satyagraha campaign.
('81', 338, 9, 19, 541051) I have, therefore, advised the Maulana Saheb to convene a meeting of the Working Committee and the A.I.C.C. at an early date, but until that decision is reversed civil disobedience has to go on.
('81', 338, 9, 20, 541246) I must admit, however, that the conduct of the campaign has been rendered difficult by the Government action in discharging civil disobedience prisoners, but if we are to reach our goal, we have to cut our way through every difficulty.
('81', 338, 9, 21, 541482) This one is nothing compared to what we are likely to have to face before we come into our own.
('81', 338, 9, 22, 541578) If the A. I. C. C. meeting is to come, as it must, pending the meeting members of the Working Committee and the A. I. C. C. must
('81', 339, 0, 1, 541707) 340 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 339, 1, 2, 541749) not offer civil disobedience, nor should those who are interested in reversing the Bombay decision.
('81', 339, 1, 3, 541849) Apart from these, civil disobedience should continue without interruption.
('81', 339, 1, 4, 541924) Of course it will stand suspended on Xmas Day, Boxing Day and New Years Day.
('81', 339, 1, 5, 542001) The question naturally arises whether civil disobedience is to be offered in the usual manner by reciting the prescribed formula 1 or in some other manner.
('81', 339, 1, 6, 542157) I like the formula method.
('81', 339, 1, 7, 542184) It gives directness and symmetry to the movement.
('81', 339, 1, 8, 542234) There is great power in the reciting of the same formula in the same manner.
('81', 339, 1, 9, 542311) It rivets the attention of the masses and men on identical theme.
('81', 339, 1, 10, 542377) The formula is not a mean thing.
('81', 339, 1, 11, 542410) It is a protest of the nation against war as an arbitrator.
('81', 339, 1, 12, 542470) It is a message of peace on earth and goodwill towards mankind.
('81', 339, 1, 13, 542534) What is individual formula today will become, in due time, that of the masses, but the authorities having discharged symbolical satyagrahis may refuse to rearrest them for reciting slogans.
('81', 339, 1, 14, 542724) There are then two ways open to us: If they do not rearrest, there need be no dismay and demoralization, the jail is not our objective.
('81', 339, 1, 15, 542860) Freedom of speech is the immediate objective.
('81', 339, 1, 16, 542906) If recitation is not objected to, we have advanced somewhat towards our objective and it will be foolish to court imprisonment for the sake of it.
('81', 339, 1, 17, 543053) Dismay and demoralization arise because Congressmen in general have not realized the inevitable connection between construc tive programme and civil disobedience.
('81', 339, 1, 18, 543216) Civil disobedience without the backing of constructive programme can never lead us to indepen dence.
('81', 339, 1, 19, 543317) Shorn of it, civil disobedience becomes method of violence bound to prove ineffective in the end.
('81', 339, 1, 20, 543415) Moreover, civil disobedience, even when it is mass, will only be offered by those who are bodily fit, whereas constructive programme is for all and will never be suspended.
('81', 339, 1, 21, 543588) If the whole nation took it up in earnest it is enough to give us complete independence.
('81', 339, 1, 22, 543677) The prosecu tion of the constructive programme means constructing the structure of swaraj.
('81', 339, 1, 23, 543768) The whole theme of corporate non violence, as I have conceived it, falls to pieces if there is no living faith in the constructive programme.
('81', 339, 1, 24, 543910) To my mind, swaraj based on non violence is a fulfilment of the
('81', 339, 2, 25, 543974) 1 Namely, It is wrong to help the British war effort with men or money.
('81', 339, 2, 26, 544046) The only worthy effort is to resist all war with non violent resistance, Vide Instructions to Satyagrahis, 8 11 1940.

('81', 340, 1, 3, 544325) I have been asked whether discharged satyagrahis should hold or attend meetings and deliver speeches.
('81', 340, 1, 4, 544427) They should do so.
('81', 340, 1, 5, 544446) I do not want or expect them to re offer civil disobedience immediately.
('81', 340, 1, 6, 544519) That would be indecent haste, but ordinary civil disobedience may go on.
('81', 340, 1, 7, 544592) For the discharged ones let there be breathing time.
('81', 340, 1, 8, 544645) Let them address meetings in their constituencies and study things.
('81', 340, 1, 9, 544713) At the meetings they will expound their views on the general situation and not hesitate to interpret anti war Congress policy.
('81', 340, 1, 10, 544840) Symbolic satyagraha has a definite meaning but it is open to the authorities to arrest Congressmen for their speeches even if they do not intend thereby to offer C. D. That was how they had arrested the Maulana Sahib and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, not to mention lesser lights.
('81', 340, 1, 11, 545116) Let it be known that I have no authority to suspend C. D. on extraneous grounds.
('81', 340, 1, 12, 545197) That is for the Congress to do.
('81', 340, 1, 13, 545229) For me personally there is no choice.
('81', 340, 1, 14, 545267) As a man sworn to peace, at this critical moment to suspend my anti war activity would be to deny myself.
('81', 340, 1, 15, 545373) Therefore, for those who think like me, whether we are misunderstood or worse befalls, we must express our faith through our action hoping thereby that ultimately our way will be accepted by all warring powers as the only escape from a blood bath which is reducing man to his lowest depth.

('81', 340, 3, 19, 545795) I can quite imagine your brothers condition.
('81', 340, 3, 20, 545840) I have written to Prakasam without mentioning the correspon dence.
('81', 340, 3, 21, 545907) Of course you will come in the afternoon and have as much time as you need.
('81', 340, 3, 22, 545983) This is just to let you know how you occupy my thoughts.

('81', 341, 1, 2, 546082) [PS.] So you could not come.
('81', 341, 1, 3, 546111) I have wired.
('81', 341, 1, 4, 546125) I must go to Bardoli.
('81', 341, 1, 5, 546147) Vallabhbhai has made elaborate preparations.
('81', 341, 1, 6, 546192) And he is so weak.
('81', 341, 1, 7, 546211) I hope you have cancelled the Lucknow address.
('81', 341, 1, 8, 546258) It is a big risk.
('81', 341, 1, 9, 546276) Do come to Bardoli as soon as you can.

('81', 341, 9, 22, 546940) They will take part in every corporate activity of the Ashram.
('81', 341, 9, 23, 547003) When free from Ashram work they will spin or carry out some other process connected with cotton.
('81', 341, 9, 24, 547100) They will prosecute their private studies from 8 to 9 p.m.
('81', 341, 9, 25, 547159) or during daytime, when they have no Ashram work to do and have done at least one hours spinning.
('81', 341, 9, 26, 547257) They may not spin when they are ill or otherwise unable to spin owing to circumstances beyond their control.
('81', 341, 10, 27, 547366) 1 Vide Letter to K. M. Munshi, 5 12 1941. 2 Ahimsa, truth, non stealing, brahmacharya, non possession, body labour, control of the palate, freedom from fear, equal regard for all religions, swadeshi and looking upon all human beings as touchables
('81', 342, 0, 1, 547613) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 343
('81', 342, 1, 2, 547660) No one should talk idly or in a loud voice.
('81', 342, 1, 3, 547704) The Ashram must bear the impress of perfect peace as well as of truth.
('81', 342, 1, 4, 547775) Our relations with one another must be marked by affection and restraint, and with guests and visitors by courtesy.
('81', 342, 1, 5, 547891) Whether a visitor is dressed in rags or in gorgeous robes, we should treat him with the same respect.
('81', 342, 1, 6, 547993) We must not make any distinction between the rich and the poor, the high and the lowly.
('81', 342, 1, 7, 548081) This does not mean that we may expect a delicately nurtured guest to live as simply as ourselves.
('81', 342, 1, 8, 548179) That is to say, in waiting upon guests, we must always take into consideration their habitual mode of life.
('81', 342, 1, 9, 548287) This is true courtesy.
('81', 342, 1, 10, 548310) If an unknown visitor arrives at the Ashram, we must ask him the purpose of his visit, and if necessary take him to the manager.
('81', 342, 1, 11, 548439) This is the duty of every inmate of the Ashram, because we cannot know whom such a visitor is likely to meet first.
('81', 342, 1, 12, 548555) Our every word and every act should be well considered.
('81', 342, 1, 13, 548611) What ever we do we should do with a will and in complete identification with the work of the moment.
('81', 342, 1, 14, 548712) Food must be taken like medicine, under proper restraint, only for sustaining the body and keeping it a fit instrument for service.
('81', 342, 1, 15, 548844) We must therefore take food in moderation or even abstemiously.
('81', 342, 1, 16, 548908) We must be content with what food we get.
('81', 342, 1, 17, 548950) If the food is insufficiently or badly cooked, we must not talk about it at meals, but courteously speak about it later to the manager of the kitchen.
('81', 342, 1, 18, 549101) Bad or imperfectly cooked food should not be eaten.
('81', 342, 1, 19, 549153) We must not champ while eating.
('81', 342, 1, 20, 549185) We must eat our food slowly, decorously and tidily in a spirit of thankfulness to God.
('81', 342, 1, 21, 549272) Everyone must wash his own dish thoroughly and keep it in its place.
('81', 342, 1, 22, 549341) Guests and visitors are requested to bring their own plate, drink ing pot, bowls and spoon, as well as lantern, bedding and mos quito net.
('81', 342, 1, 23, 549480) They must not have more clothes than necessary.
('81', 342, 1, 24, 549528) Their clothes should be made of khadi.
('81', 342, 1, 25, 549567) Other things must be as far as possible village made or at least swadeshi.
('81', 342, 1, 26, 549642) Everything must be kept in its proper place.
('81', 342, 1, 27, 549687) All refuse must be put into the dust bin.
('81', 342, 1, 28, 549729) Water must not be wasted.
('81', 342, 1, 29, 549755) Boiled water is used for drinking pur poses.
('81', 342, 1, 30, 549800) Pots and pans are finally washed with boiled water.
('81', 342, 1, 31, 549852) Unboiled water of the Ashram wells is not safe to drink.
('81', 342, 1, 32, 549909) It is necessary to learn the distinction between boiling water and hot water.
('81', 342, 1, 33, 549987) Boiling water is that in which pulses are cooked; and which gives out lots of steam.
('81', 342, 1, 34, 550072) No one can drink boiling water.
('81', 343, 0, 1, 550104) 344 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 343, 1, 2, 550146) We should not spit or clean the nose on the road, but only in an out of the way place where no one is likely to walk.
('81', 343, 1, 3, 550264) The call of nature must be attended to only at the appointed place.
('81', 343, 1, 4, 550332) It is necessary to clean oneself after answering either call of nature.
('81', 343, 1, 5, 550404) The water jug used in the toilet is, as it should always be, set apart.
('81', 343, 1, 6, 550476) After a visit to the latrine, we must wash our hands with pure earth and pure water, and wipe them with a clean napkin.
('81', 343, 1, 7, 550596) The night soil must be fully covered with dry earth so as not to attract flies and in such a way that nothing but dry earth is visible.
('81', 343, 1, 8, 550732) One must sit carefully on the latrine seat, so that the seat does not get dirty and the stool drops into the receptacle.
('81', 343, 1, 9, 550853) A lantern must be carried if it is dark.
('81', 343, 1, 10, 550894) Everything which can attract flies should be properly covered.
('81', 343, 1, 11, 550957) Teeth must be cleaned with care at the proper place.
('81', 343, 1, 12, 551010) The end of the twig must be well chewed into a soft brush, and the teeth and the gums must be brushed with it inside and out.
('81', 343, 1, 13, 551136) The saliva discharged during brushing must be spat out.
('81', 343, 1, 14, 551192) It must not be swallowed.
('81', 343, 1, 15, 551218) After the teeth are well brushed the twig must be split into two to clean the tongue with.
('81', 343, 1, 16, 551309) Then the mouth should be carefully washed.
('81', 343, 1, 17, 551352) The nose also should be cleaned by drawing in water.
('81', 343, 1, 18, 551405) The split twigs should be washed well, and collected in a pot.
('81', 343, 1, 19, 551468) When they dry up they should be used for starting a fire, the idea being that nothing which can be used should be thrown away.
('81', 343, 1, 20, 551595) Waste paper, which cannot be used for writing on the other side, should be burned.
('81', 343, 1, 21, 551678) Nothing else should be mixed with it.
('81', 343, 1, 22, 551716) The refuse from leafy vegetables must be kept separate and converted into manure.
('81', 343, 1, 23, 551798) Broken glass should be thrown into a pit at a safe distance from houses.
('81', 343, 1, 24, 551871) If anyone visits the Ashram or comes as a guest he should be received with love.
('81', 343, 1, 25, 551952) He should not feel an outsider.
('81', 343, 1, 26, 551984) In the Ashram everything should be in its proper place and every nook and corner should be clean.
('81', 343, 1, 27, 552082) No dust should be allowed to collect on the doors, nor should they be sticky.
('81', 343, 1, 28, 552160) Everyone should do with great care the work allotted to him.
('81', 343, 1, 29, 552221) No one should absent himself from a collective task.
('81', 343, 1, 30, 552274) There should be the most scrupulous care in cleaning the utensils.
('81', 343, 1, 31, 552341) The latrines should always be kept dry.
('81', 343, 1, 32, 552381) The night soil must always be covered with dry earth.
('81', 343, 1, 33, 552435) Much water stagnates near the water room; this is not good.
('81', 343, 1, 34, 552495) Food should always be kept covered, so that it does not attract flies.
('81', 344, 0, 1, 552566) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 345
('81', 344, 1, 2, 552613) In the matter of food everyone should remember our vow about control of the palate, and eat all the things as medicine.
('81', 344, 1, 3, 552733) We should not be perturbed if occasionally we miss an item.
('81', 344, 1, 4, 552793) Whatever we get should be accepted as Gods grace.
('81', 344, 1, 5, 552843) We should learn to understand correctly the meaning of our prayer.
('81', 344, 1, 6, 552910) Take care of the Ashram property while you are using it, as if it were your own.

('81', 345, 1, 3, 553938) When Ratu 1 had run away, the Doctor 2 had lost all peace of mind and recovered it only when he had found him.
('81', 345, 1, 4, 554049) I do not suggest that Prabhashankar 3 is right.
('81', 345, 1, 5, 554097) If Ratu is not as mad as we think, it is certainly a good thing.
('81', 345, 1, 6, 554162) If he is worse, it would do nothing but good for you to go.
('81', 345, 1, 7, 554222) Maybe, your very presence will calm him.
('81', 345, 1, 8, 554263) The children may be kept away for their own safety.
('81', 345, 1, 9, 554315) They may stay with Manjula and you may live somewhere with Ratilal.

('81', 345, 9, 22, 554991) [Before December 9, 1941]
('81', 345, 10, 23, 555017) Sir E. I recently had an hour and a half talk with Mr. Jinnah and heard his point of view.
('81', 345, 10, 24, 555108) I do not know what following he has, but he reiterated again and again : Never will Muslims be subservient to Hindu authority.
('81', 345, 10, 25, 555235) You English and Germans are much closer to each other than Hindus and Muslims. I would like to know what you have to say in regard to this.
('81', 345, 11, 26, 555375) 1 Ratilal, addressees brother, and Dr. Pranjivandas Mehta, addressees father 2 ibid
('81', 345, 12, 27, 555459) 3 Prabhashankar Parekh, Ratilals father in law 4 According to Evelyn Wrench, Editor of The Spectator, the interview took place just before Christmas, 1941, in Gandhijis Ashram, Sevagram, Wardha.
('81', 345, 12, 28, 555654) The period, however, has been inferred from the fact that Gandhiji was at Wardha in December 1941 up to the 9th, when he left for Bardoli.
('81', 346, 0, 1, 555793) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 347
('81', 346, 1, 2, 555840) GANDHIJI.
('81', 346, 1, 3, 555850) I deny absolutely what Jinnah sahib says.
('81', 346, 1, 4, 555892) The Muslim is as much an Indian as I am and of the same blood.
('81', 346, 1, 5, 555955) There is no fundamental cleavage between Hindus and Musalmans.
('81', 346, 1, 6, 556018) We have lived in the same land as brothers for generations and what has been possible all these years will certainly be possible in the future.
('81', 346, 1, 7, 556162) With due respect to Jinnasahib, he resorts unconsciously to an untruth when he says what you have just quoted, and speaks as a disappointed man does in order to maintain his view at any cost.
('81', 346, 1, 8, 556354) In any case, the fear of subservience is quite imaginary.
('81', 346, 1, 9, 556412) No one can dominate a population of 80,000,000. Can such a number be termed a minority?
('81', 346, 1, 10, 556500) I personally would resist the subservience even of the Parsis, who are a mere handful, i.e., 1,00,000 , because I believe in equality for all and has throughout been the Congress creed.
('81', 346, 1, 11, 556686) But I admit that Jinnah sahibs fear though in fact imaginary is a real thing in his estimation, and therefore he has my sympathy.
('81', 346, 2, 12, 556816) Sir E. What about the possibility of a free and equal India becoming a partner in the British Commonwealth in the sense that Canada and Australia are partners?
('81', 346, 3, 13, 556976) G. Bitter experience has shown that India cannot be that in the sense that Canada and Australia are.
('81', 346, 3, 14, 557077) At the moment the British Common wealth is a Commonwealth of White nations.
('81', 346, 3, 15, 557153) But I go a step further than you.
('81', 346, 3, 16, 557187) Why only a British Commonwealth?
('81', 346, 3, 17, 557220) Whoever is victor, there should be, after the war, a commonwealth of all nations.
('81', 346, 3, 18, 557302) The British Commonwealth must give a place to this and no one must be excluded.
('81', 346, 3, 19, 557382) Germany, Italy, Russia, all must come in, not only those who are today Allies of Britain.
('81', 346, 3, 20, 557472) India will gladly be a member of such a common wealth.
('81', 346, 4, 21, 557527) Sir E. You are indulging in undue optimism.
('81', 346, 4, 22, 557571) I worked seven years for the All Peoples Association in Europe and my experiences there during the last two decades do not lead to hope that the real internationalism is round the corner.
('81', 346, 4, 23, 557759) Anyhow, your and my goal of universal brotherhood is common.
('81', 346, 4, 24, 557820) Is it thus wise to destroy or abolish what has stood for a Commonwealth of at least some nations when the world is not ready for the ultimate ideal?
('81', 346, 4, 25, 557969) G. It is not a question of abolition.
('81', 346, 4, 26, 558007) It is a question of extending the scope of the British Commonwealth.
('81', 346, 4, 27, 558076) If Britain wins wholly, Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and perhaps even Bolshevik Russia will dis appear.
('81', 346, 4, 28, 558179) If Britain were honest, which I dispute, she would then embrace all nations on terms of equality.
('81', 346, 5, 29, 558277) Sir E. According to the sentiments expressed in the Atlantic Charter?
('81', 346, 6, 30, 558347) 1 A joint declaration was drawn up at a series of meetings on board warships in the North Atlantic in August, 1941 by Franklin D. Roosevelt, the then President of the United States and Winston Churchill the then Prime Minister of the United
('81', 347, 0, 1, 558588) 348 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 347, 1, 2, 558630) G. What is the Atlantic Charter?
('81', 347, 1, 3, 558663) It went down the ocean as soon as it was born !
('81', 347, 1, 4, 558711) I do not understand it.
('81', 347, 1, 5, 558735) And Mr. Amery denies that India is fit for democracy, while Mr. Churchill says the Charter could not apply to India.
('81', 347, 1, 6, 558852) Force of circumstances will falsify their declara tions.
('81', 347, 1, 7, 558909) Personally I like to believe that all become honest, the millen nium is round the corner!
('81', 347, 2, 8, 558999) Sir E. I know your views on pacifism.
('81', 347, 2, 9, 559037) But all the same you wont impede the British war effort?
('81', 347, 2, 10, 559094) G. I said I would not embarrass Britain.
('81', 347, 2, 11, 559135) And so far as civil disobedience is concerned, I have demonstrated that this is so.
('81', 347, 2, 12, 559219) A non violent man cannot desire embarrassment.
('81', 347, 2, 13, 559266) And Government, in using the term symbolic 1 in their recent release of satyagrahis unsought by the satyagrahis have tacitly admitted non embarrassment.
('81', 347, 2, 14, 559419) Had Congress wished, it would have been possible to ignite a spark that would have swept right over India and which would certainly have deflected British energy from the war.
('81', 347, 3, 15, 559595) Sir E. You want Britain to win, dont you?
('81', 347, 3, 16, 559637) Cannot you under any circumstances give active support to our war effort?
('81', 347, 3, 17, 559711) G. I do not wish disaster to British arms.
('81', 347, 3, 18, 559754) In saying this I may be said to have modified my original words.
('81', 347, 3, 19, 559819) But I cannot give active support in the war effort without denying a life time of practice.
('81', 347, 4, 20, 559911) Sir E. Compared with fifteen years ago, has not British opinion moved favourably towards India?
('81', 347, 4, 21, 560007) There are two powerful sections of public opinion in Great Britain today one which holds that she should move closer to the U.S.A. and the Dominion with a view to forming a federation between these English speaking democracies and definitely cut loose from India, which with its alien civilization they say has little in common with the Anglo Saxons; the other consists of those who believe that the chief glory of the British Commonwealth is that it can admit nations of any race, creed or colour to become partners within its orbit.
('81', 347, 4, 22, 560542) Do you not trust us?
('81', 347, 4, 23, 560563) Do you not think that we are genuine when we see the difficulties inherent in the diffferent viewpoints of yourself and Mr. Jinnah?
('81', 347, 4, 24, 560695) Would there not be civil war if we were to withdraw?
('81', 347, 5, 25, 560748) Kingdom, stating certain common principles and policies on which the two leaders based their hopes for a better future for humankind after World War II.
('81', 347, 5, 26, 560901) It condemned the use of force and territorial aggrandizement and defined the right of all peoples to self determination and self government.
('81', 347, 5, 27, 561042) Though it was incorporated by reference in the declaration by the United Nations of January 1, 1942, the Atlantic Charter, like many war time declarations, it was characterized more by vague generosity that by any precise commitment.

('81', 348, 1, 2, 561485) G. I believe that a party wishing equality for India does exist in Britain.
('81', 348, 1, 3, 561561) But it is an insignificant minority, and while I honour and like their opinion I cannot be enthused over it, for I know that those who shape policy and dominate are otherwise inclined.
('81', 348, 1, 4, 561746) For me, therefore, it is only the Secretary of State who counts.
('81', 348, 1, 5, 561811) I see no genuine ring in his statement.
('81', 348, 1, 6, 561851) If he were honest he would not ask for an agreed solution among us as the first step.
('81', 348, 1, 7, 561937) It is obvious that if Jinnasaheb asks me for things which I cannot give him, he will naturally go to the third party where he can get what he wants, as he did in London during the Round Table Conference 1. The minority pact was there flung on us one fine morning unknown to any one of us.
('81', 348, 1, 8, 562226) It is one of the most disgraceful chapters in British history.
('81', 348, 1, 9, 562289) The Secretary of State should realize that the last word is in his hands.
('81', 348, 1, 10, 562363) Hence it is that I have said you should retire and we shall have a pact in fifteen days.
('81', 348, 1, 11, 562452) There may be civil war, it is highly probable there will be, but at the end of it there will be peace.
('81', 348, 2, 12, 562555) E. At the end of all wars there is peace.
('81', 348, 3, 13, 562597) G. You proposition was wrong.
('81', 348, 3, 14, 562627) You can only have lasting peace based on justice.
('81', 348, 3, 15, 562677) We are an unarmed people.
('81', 348, 3, 16, 562703) Your armies are meant to suppress an armed rebellion and are not for use by us.
('81', 348, 3, 17, 562783) The Indian troops are mercenaries and would be of no use in the civil war.
('81', 348, 3, 18, 562858) It is the politically conscious Muslims and Hindus who will fight.
('81', 348, 3, 19, 562925) They will fight with sticks, staves and soda water bottles, but they will soon tire, and there will be wise men enough among us to bring about an honourable peace.
('81', 348, 4, 20, 563089) Sir E. Are you not assuming too much?
('81', 348, 4, 21, 563127) G. I assume nothing.
('81', 348, 4, 22, 563148) These are daily happenings.
('81', 348, 4, 23, 563176) There is breaking of each others heads for a couple of days and then there is peace.
('81', 348, 5, 24, 563261) Sir E. But a Hindu cannot dine with a Muslim.
('81', 348, 5, 25, 563307) Mr. Jinnah says these social barriers matter a good deal.
('81', 348, 5, 26, 563365) G. They do not.
('81', 348, 5, 27, 563381) You inter dine and inter marry with Germans and yet are both saturated with hate for each other.
('81', 348, 6, 28, 563478) Sir E. May I take it that you would oppose Pakistan even if it were agreed upon by the Muslims and Britain?
('81', 348, 7, 29, 563586) G. No agreement between the British and Muslims can affect me.
('81', 348, 7, 30, 563649) An agreement between Hindus and Muslims alone will affect me.
('81', 348, 8, 31, 563711) Sir E. Do you not think that Britain has stood for freedom and democracytake Canada, Australia, South Africa?

('81', 349, 0, 1, 563831) 350 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 349, 1, 2, 563873) G. You have stood for these things simply for the spoilation of the weakers races.
('81', 349, 1, 3, 563956) I have lived for twenty years in South Africa and I know the quarrel between you and the Dutch was over the sharing of the spoils and the same is happening elsewhere in Africa, too.
('81', 349, 2, 4, 564138) Sir E. But very few are ready for a world Commonwealth.
('81', 349, 2, 5, 564194) At what moment would you be willing to join a Commonwealth?
('81', 349, 2, 6, 564254) G. When Africa, China, Japan are all included.
('81', 349, 2, 7, 564301) I cannot be subservient anywhere.
('81', 349, 3, 8, 564335) Sir E. Are you opposed to defence behind an international group?
('81', 349, 3, 9, 564400) G. I would agree to a minimum international police force.
('81', 349, 4, 10, 564458) Sir E. What about an air force?
('81', 349, 4, 11, 564490) G. On no account.
('81', 349, 4, 12, 564508) I look upon air power for destruction as a terrible crime against humanity.
('81', 349, 5, 13, 564584) Sir E. But if you do not agree to an armed force to stop aggression other Hitlers may arise.
('81', 349, 5, 14, 564677) G. They will not arise if justice prevails.
('81', 349, 5, 15, 564721) Hitler is a scourge sent by God to punish men for their iniquities.
('81', 349, 6, 16, 564789) Sir E. Take the case of Abyssinia.
('81', 349, 6, 17, 564824) If there had been an armed international force we could have stopped Mussolini from that conquest.
('81', 349, 7, 18, 564923) G. You cannot cure a lesser evil by a greater evil.
('81', 349, 7, 19, 564975) You might have succeeded in wiping out Italy, but how would that have helped?
('81', 349, 7, 20, 565053) Britains success in the exploitaion of non European races raised the ambition of Bismarck and later Mussolini and others.
('81', 349, 8, 21, 565175) Sir E. But is not the mentality now passing?
('81', 349, 8, 22, 565220) I assure you it is in England.
('81', 349, 8, 23, 565251) Take the case of Iraq, to whom we have given independence.
('81', 349, 8, 24, 565310) G. I wish I could think that.
('81', 349, 8, 25, 565340) I do not agree that there is freedom in Iraq today.
('81', 349, 8, 26, 565392) I do not read current history as you do.
('81', 349, 8, 27, 565433) Nothing is of a permanent nature.
('81', 349, 8, 28, 565467) One can only talk of good intentions when the war is over.
('81', 349, 8, 29, 565526) I would love to see that Iraq at least had real complete independence after the war.
('81', 349, 9, 30, 565611) Sir E. You may call me prejudiced, but Churchill has definitely announced that there will be no a acquisition of territory, etc.
('81', 349, 10, 31, 565740) G. You are not prejudiced.
('81', 349, 10, 32, 565767) You have perforce to believe what is told you.
('81', 349, 10, 33, 565814) I have grave doubts.
('81', 349, 10, 34, 565835) I mean no ill.
('81', 349, 10, 35, 565850) Having given up arms, I can mean none.
('81', 349, 10, 36, 565889) I never think of imaginary evils, however.
('81', 349, 10, 37, 565932) There is no distrust of men and mankind in me.
('81', 349, 10, 38, 565979) They will answer before God, so why should I worry?
('81', 349, 10, 39, 566031) But where my own mission is concerned, my thought is active, and I try to wish everyone well in spite of doubts and mistrust.
('81', 349, 10, 40, 566157) I will suffer the agony if that is to be my lot.
('81', 349, 10, 41, 566206) But I may not

('81', 350, 1, 2, 566267) unnerve myself while I can struggle against evil.
('81', 350, 2, 3, 566317) Sir E. Try to believe there are more people in great Britain than you imagine in favour of Indias inclusion as a free partner in the British Commonwealth of Nations.
('81', 350, 2, 4, 566483) I can give you proof.
('81', 350, 2, 5, 566505) There is the Labour Party.
('81', 350, 2, 6, 566532) G. I believe you are a growing party.
('81', 350, 2, 7, 566570) All the same, I feel you are still insignificant.
('81', 350, 2, 8, 566620) But you mention Labour Party, which is a dismal failure today.
('81', 350, 2, 9, 566683) It takes its seat in the House of Lords!
('81', 350, 3, 10, 566724) Sir E. After the war would you consider every problem if you felt India was to be free?
('81', 350, 3, 11, 566812) G. I have shut my mind against nothing and I am a friend of Great Britain.
('81', 350, 3, 12, 566887) I always have been.
('81', 350, 3, 13, 566907) I have no axe to grind.
('81', 350, 3, 14, 566931) Whatever I do is out of love.

('81', 350, 6, 19, 567079) I cannot bear to see you fall ill.
('81', 350, 6, 20, 567114) One who wants to serve must acquire control over the body.
('81', 350, 6, 21, 567173) There is nothing wrong in your involving yourself with womens organizations.
('81', 350, 6, 22, 567250) You have to come in close contact with women.
('81', 350, 6, 23, 567296) We ourselves create obstacles for ourselves.
('81', 350, 6, 24, 567341) Had you got rid of your fear, you would have come to stay at Sevagram earlier.
('81', 350, 6, 25, 567420) People may not like to be here permanently.
('81', 350, 6, 26, 567464) But I notice that many people have liked it at least for a few days.
('81', 350, 6, 27, 567533) Miss Moores situation is as you have described.
('81', 350, 6, 28, 567581) Having lived in the same social milieu, her ideas are unsympathetic.
('81', 350, 6, 29, 567650) She appeared to me to be a good woman.
('81', 350, 6, 30, 567689) She lived here very nicely.
('81', 350, 6, 31, 567717) Now you may not have to go.

('81', 351, 0, 1, 568025) 352 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 351, 1, 2, 568067) what in reality they are fighting for, it is healthy and uplifting to contemplate what a man like Badshah Khan, the first among the Khidmatgars, is doing for the cause of peace and for qualifying himself for taking an effective part by non violent means in the freedom movement.
('81', 351, 1, 3, 568346) He has undying faith in non violence though he has not worked out all its implications.
('81', 351, 1, 4, 568434) For the last few months, he has been holding little camps for non violent training of Khudai Khid matgars.
('81', 351, 1, 5, 568541) But during the third week of November he held a biggish one 1, to which he had invited neighbouring workers from the Punjab, Kashmir and Baluchistan.
('81', 351, 1, 6, 568691) Charkha was the important activity.
('81', 351, 1, 7, 568727) Over three hundred wheels plied daily.
('81', 351, 1, 8, 568766) Dhanush takli was also introduced in the camp.
('81', 351, 1, 9, 568813) Its cheapness and the ease with which it could be manu factured in every village appealed to everyone.
('81', 351, 1, 10, 568916) Sanitation work was done in the surrounding villages and there were speeches explaining non violence.
('81', 351, 1, 11, 569018) A resolution was passed appealing to tribesmen to be peaceful and non violent.
('81', 351, 1, 12, 569097) Copies of it were printed for distribution among those tribesmen who came into British territory.
('81', 351, 1, 13, 569195) Here is the daily routine : 6 a.m.
('81', 351, 1, 14, 569230) azan 1 for prayers; from 6 to 7.30 prayers; from 7.30 to 7.45 morning exercise; from 7.45 to 8 tea; from 8 to 10.55 village cleaning; from 11 to 12 noon, school; from 12 to 2 p.m.

('81', 351, 1, 16, 569445) to 3.30 p.m.
('81', 351, 1, 17, 569458) spinning; from 3.30 p.m.
('81', 351, 1, 18, 569483) to 4.30 p.m.
('81', 351, 1, 19, 569496) public meeting; 4.30 p.m.
('81', 351, 1, 20, 569522) to 5 p.m.
('81', 351, 1, 21, 569532) flag salutation; from 5 p.m.
('81', 351, 1, 22, 569561) to 7 p.m.
('81', 351, 1, 23, 569571) informal discussion; 7 p.m.
('81', 351, 1, 24, 569599) to 8 p.m.
('81', 351, 1, 25, 569609) evening meal; 8 p.m.
('81', 351, 1, 26, 569630) to 9 p.m.
('81', 351, 1, 27, 569640) roll call.
('81', 351, 1, 28, 569651) Village cleaning was done in perfectly orderly manner.
('81', 351, 1, 29, 569706) Workers were divided into several parties, carrying their own brooms.
('81', 351, 1, 30, 569776) Villagers supplemented these from their own stock and joined Khidmatgars in this loving service.
('81', 351, 1, 31, 569873) They did not leave out even police stations.
('81', 351, 1, 32, 569918) Men in charge of these gratefully accepted the service.
('81', 351, 1, 33, 569974) The camp worked like this for seven days from November 16 to 22. There were about 20 Hindus and two women in the party.
('81', 351, 1, 34, 570094) Badshah Khan, though ill himself, took part in every activity.
('81', 351, 1, 35, 570157) The camp was of the simplest character.
('81', 351, 1, 36, 570197) There were no servants.
('81', 351, 1, 37, 570221) One medical man had volunteered his services which were most useful as many men were suffering from malaria.
('81', 351, 1, 38, 570330) The Government had also sent a doctor with some medicines.

('81', 352, 1, 4, 570680) The camp consisted of about five hundred representatives and guests from all over the N. W. F. Province.
('81', 352, 1, 5, 570785) They were accommodated in little tents without side flaps.
('81', 352, 1, 6, 570844) The total cost of running the camp was about Rs. 1,500. Congressmen and others could profitably copy the simplicity, economy and orderliness of this camp.

('81', 352, 7, 26, 571935) We should absorb the boys who are well trained.

('81', 353, 4, 5, 572302) BHAI AMARNATHJI, I have your letter.
('81', 353, 4, 6, 572339) I did not answer your previous letter because Kakasaheb and Shrimanji were going to visit you.
('81', 353, 4, 7, 572434) Kakasaheb has given me a full report.
('81', 353, 4, 8, 572472) Let us see what Tandonji has to say.
('81', 353, 4, 9, 572509) We must at all cost avoid friction.

('81', 353, 7, 12, 572607) 621. CONSTRUCTIVE PROGRAMME : ITS MEANING AND PLACE 1
('81', 353, 8, 13, 572661) [December 13, 1941] 2 INTRODUCTORY The constructive programme may otherwise and more fittingly be called construction of poorna swaraj or complete independence by truthful and non violent means.
('81', 353, 8, 14, 572856) Effort for construction of independence so called through violent and, therefore, necessarily untruthful means we know only too painfully.
('81', 353, 8, 15, 572995) Look at the daily destruction of property, life and truth in the present war.
('81', 353, 8, 16, 573073) Complete independence through truth and non violence means the independence of every unit, be it the humblest of the nation, with 
('81', 353, 9, 17, 573204) 1According to Mahatma, Vol. VI, Gandhiji wrote this on the train from Wardha to Bardoli.
('81', 353, 9, 18, 573293) Gandhiji left Sevagram on December 9, 1941, and reached Bardoli on December 10, 1941. However, in his letter to Mirabehn dated December 13, 1941, Gandhiji says, I was immersed in writing work which is just finished. Apparently he commenced writing this on the train and finished it later at Bardoli.
('81', 353, 9, 19, 573593) The version reproduced here was thoroughly revised and date lined Poona, 13 11 1945.
('81', 353, 9, 20, 573678) The Foreword and the two Appendices appear in their chronological places under the dates November 13, 1945, January 16, 1946, and January 27, 1948. 2 ibid
('81', 354, 0, 1, 573833) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 355
('81', 354, 1, 2, 573880) out distinction of race, colour or creed.
('81', 354, 1, 3, 573922) This independence is never exclusive.
('81', 354, 1, 4, 573960) It is, therefore, wholly compatible with interdepen dence within or without.
('81', 354, 1, 5, 574037) Practice will always fall short of the theory, even as the drawn line falls short of the theoretical line of Euclid.
('81', 354, 1, 6, 574154) Therefore, complete independence will be complete only to the extent of our approach in practice to truth and non violence.
('81', 354, 1, 7, 574278) Let the reader mentally plan out the whole of the constructive programme, and he will agree with me that, if it could be successfully worked out, the end of it would be the independence we want.
('81', 354, 1, 8, 574473) Has not Mr. Amery said that an agreement between the major parties, trans lated in my language, any agreement after communal unity which is only one item in the constructive programme, will be respected?
('81', 354, 1, 9, 574677) We need not question his sincerity, for if such unity is honestly, i.e., non violently, attained, it will in itself contain the power to compel acceptance of the agreed demand.
('81', 354, 1, 10, 574854) On the other hand there is no such thing as an imaginary or even perfect definition of independence through violence.
('81', 354, 1, 11, 574972) For it pre supposes only ascendancy of that party of the nation which makes the most effective use of violence.
('81', 354, 1, 12, 575084) In it perfect equality, economic or otherwise, is inconceivable.
('81', 354, 1, 13, 575149) But for my purpose, which is to convince the reader of the necessity of following out the constructive programme in the non violent effort, the acceptance of my argument about the ineffective ness of violence for the attainment of independence is not required.
('81', 354, 1, 14, 575410) The reader is welcome to the belief that independence of this hum blest unit is possible under a scheme of violence, if this effort enables him also to admit that it is a certainty through the complete execution of the programme by the nation.
('81', 354, 1, 15, 575654) Let us now examine the items :
('81', 354, 2, 16, 575685) 1. COMMUNAL UNITY
('81', 354, 3, 17, 575703) Everybody is agreed about the necessity of this unity.
('81', 354, 3, 18, 575758) But everybody does not know that unity does not mean political unity, which may be imposed.
('81', 354, 3, 19, 575850) It means an unbreakable heart unity.
('81', 354, 3, 20, 575887) The first thing essential for achieving such unity is for every Congressman, whatever his religion may be, to represent in his own person Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Zoroastrian, Jew, etc., shortly, every Hindu and non Hindu.
('81', 354, 3, 21, 576111) He has to feel his identity with every one of the millions of the inhabitants of Hindustan.
('81', 354, 3, 22, 576203) In order to realize this, every Con gressman will cultivate personal friendship with persons represent ing faiths other than his own.
('81', 354, 3, 23, 576337) He should have the same regard for the other faiths as he has for his own.
('81', 355, 0, 1, 576412) 356 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 355, 1, 2, 576454) In such a happy state of things there would be no disgraceful cry at the stations such as Hindu water and Muslim water or  Hindu tea and  Muslim tea.
('81', 355, 1, 3, 576604) There would be no separate rooms or pots for Hindus and non Hindus in schools and colleges, no communal schools, colleges and hospitals.
('81', 355, 1, 4, 576741) The beginning of such a revolution has to be made by Congressmen without any political motive behind the correct conduct.
('81', 355, 1, 5, 576863) Political unity will be its natural fruit.
('81', 355, 2, 6, 576906) We have long been accustomed to think that power comes only through Legislative Assemblies.
('81', 355, 2, 7, 576998) I have regarded this belief as a grave error brought about by inertia or hypnotism.
('81', 355, 2, 8, 577082) A superficial study of British history has made us think that all power percolates to the people from parliaments.
('81', 355, 2, 9, 577197) The truth is that power resides in the people and it is entrusted for the time being to those whom they may choose as their representatives.
('81', 355, 2, 10, 577338) Parliaments have no power or even existence independently of the people.
('81', 355, 2, 11, 577411) It has been my effort for the last twenty one years to convince the people of this simple truth.
('81', 355, 2, 12, 577508) Civil disobe dience is the storehouse of power.
('81', 355, 2, 13, 577556) Imagine a whole people unwilling to conform to the laws of the legislature, and prepared to suffer the consequences of non compliance.
('81', 355, 2, 14, 577691) They will bring the whole legis lative and executive machinery to a standstill.
('81', 355, 2, 15, 577771) The police and the military are of use to coerce minorities however powerful they may be.
('81', 355, 2, 16, 577861) But no police or military coercion can bend the resolute will of a people who are out for suffering to the uttermost.
('81', 355, 2, 17, 577979) And parliamentary procedure is good only when its members are willing to conform to the will of the majority.
('81', 355, 2, 18, 578089) In other words, it is fairly effective only among compatibles.
('81', 355, 2, 19, 578152) Here in India we have been pretending to work the parlimentary system under separate electorates which have created artificial incom patibles.
('81', 355, 2, 20, 578295) Living unity can never come out of these artificial entities being brought together on a common platform.
('81', 355, 2, 21, 578401) Such legislatures may function.
('81', 355, 2, 22, 578433) But they can only be a platform for wrangling and sharing the crumbs of power that may fall from rulers whoever they may be.
('81', 355, 2, 23, 578558) These rule with rod of iron, and prevent the opposing elements from flying at one anothers throats.
('81', 355, 2, 24, 578658) I hold the emergence of complete independence to be an impossibility out of such a disgrace.
('81', 355, 3, 25, 578751) 1 The first edition here has the following additional paragraph : The implication of such heart unity may seem startling, though it is the logical necessity.
('81', 355, 3, 26, 578909) Congressmen cannot aim at parliamentary power in opposition to persons of other faiths.
('81', 355, 3, 27, 578997) Congressmen, therefore, will refrain, so long as these differences last, from entering the parliamentary arena.
('81', 356, 0, 1, 579109) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 357
('81', 356, 1, 2, 579156) Though I hold such strong views, I have come to the conclusion that so long as there are undersirable candidates for elective bodies, Congress should put up candidates in order to prevent reactionaries from entering such bodies.
('81', 356, 2, 3, 579385) 2. REMOVAL OF UNTOUCHABILITY
('81', 356, 3, 4, 579414) At this time of the day it is unnecessary to dilate upon the necessity of the removal of this blot and curse upon Hinduism.
('81', 356, 3, 5, 579538) Congressmen have certainly done much in this matter.
('81', 356, 3, 6, 579591) But I am sorry to have to say that many Congressmen have looked upon this item as a mere political necessity and not something indispensable, so far as Hindus are concerned, for the very existence of Hinduism.
('81', 356, 3, 7, 579801) If Hindu Congressmen take up the cause for its own sake, they will influence the so called sanatanis far more extensively than they have hitherto done.
('81', 356, 3, 8, 579953) They should approach them not in a militant spirit but, as befits their non violence, in a spirit of friendliness.
('81', 356, 3, 9, 580068) And so far as Harijans are concerned, every Hindu should make common cause with them and befriend them in their awful isolationsuch isolation as perhaps the world has never seen in the monstrous immensity one witnesses in India.
('81', 356, 3, 10, 580297) I know from experience how difficult the task is.
('81', 356, 3, 11, 580347) But it is part of the task of building the edifice of swaraj.
('81', 356, 3, 12, 580409) And the road to swaraj is steep and narrow.
('81', 356, 3, 13, 580453) There are many slippery ascents and many deep chasms.
('81', 356, 3, 14, 580507) They have all to be negotiated with unfaltering step before we can reach the summit and breathe the fresh air of freedom.
('81', 356, 4, 15, 580629) 3. PROHIBITION
('81', 356, 5, 16, 580644) Although like communal unity and removal of untouchability prohibition has been on the Congress programme since 1920, Congressmen have not taken the interest they might have taken in this very vital social and moral reform.
('81', 356, 5, 17, 580868) If we are to reach our goal through non violent effort, we may not leave to the future government the fate of lakhs of men and women who are labouring under the curse of intoxicants and narcotics.
('81', 356, 5, 18, 581065) Medical men can make a most effective contribution towards the removal of this evil.
('81', 356, 5, 19, 581150) They have to discover ways of weaning the drunkard and the opium addict from the curse.
('81', 356, 5, 20, 581238) Women and students have a special opportunity in advancing this reform.
('81', 356, 5, 21, 581310) By many acts of loving service they can acquire on addicts a hold which will compel them to listen to the appeal to give up the evil habit.
('81', 356, 5, 22, 581450) Congress committees can open recreation booths where the tired labourer will rest his limbs, get healthy and cheap refreshments, and find suitable games.
('81', 356, 5, 23, 581604) All this work is fascinating and uplifting.
('81', 357, 0, 1, 581648) 358 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 357, 1, 2, 581690) non violent approach to swaraj is a novel approach.
('81', 357, 1, 3, 581742) In it old values give place to new.
('81', 357, 1, 4, 581778) In the violent way such reforms may find no place.
('81', 357, 1, 5, 581829) Believers in that way, in their impatience and, shall I say, ignorance, put off such things to the day of deliverance.
('81', 357, 1, 6, 581948) They forget that lasting and healthy deliverance comes from within, i.e., from self purification.
('81', 357, 1, 7, 582046) Constructive workers make legal prohibition easy and successful even if they do not pave the way for it.
('81', 357, 2, 8, 582151) 4. KHADI
('81', 357, 3, 9, 582160) Khadi is a controversial subject.
('81', 357, 3, 10, 582194) Many people think that in advocating khadi I am sailing against a headwind and am sure to sink the ship of swaraj and that I am taking the country to the dark ages.
('81', 357, 3, 11, 582359) I do not propose to argue the case for khadi in this brief survey.
('81', 357, 3, 12, 582426) I have argued it sufficiently elsewhere.
('81', 357, 3, 13, 582467) Here I want to show what every Congressman, and for that matter every Indian, can do to advance the cause of khadi.
('81', 357, 3, 14, 582583) It connotes the beginning of economic freedom and equality of all in the country.
('81', 357, 3, 15, 582665) The proof of the pudding is in the eating.
('81', 357, 3, 16, 582708) Let everyone try, and he or she will find out for himself or herself the truth of what I am saying.
('81', 357, 3, 17, 582808) Khadi must be taken with all its implications.
('81', 357, 3, 18, 582855) It means a wholesale swadeshi mentality, a determination to find all the necessaries of life in India and that too through the labour and intellect of the villagers.
('81', 357, 3, 19, 583021) That means a reversal of the existing process.
('81', 357, 3, 20, 583068) That is to say that, instead of half a dozen cities of India and Great Britain living on the exploitation and the ruin of the 7,00,000 villages of India, the latter will be largely self contained, and will voluntarily serve the cities of India and even the outside world in so far as it benefits both the parties.
('81', 357, 3, 21, 583382) This needs a revolutionary change in the mentality and tastes of many.
('81', 357, 3, 22, 583453) Easy though the non violent way is in many respects, it is very difficult in many others.
('81', 357, 3, 23, 583543) It vitally touches the life of every single Indian, makes him feel aglow with the possession of a power that has lain hidden within himself, and makes him proud of his identity with every drop of the ocean of Indian humanity.
('81', 357, 3, 24, 583769) This non violence is not the inanity for which we have mistaken it through all these long ages; it is the most potent force as yet known to mankind and on which its very existence is dependent.
('81', 357, 3, 25, 583963) It is that force which I have tried to present to the Congress and through it to the world.
('81', 357, 3, 26, 584055) Khadi to me is the symbol of unity of Indian humanity, of its economic freedom and equality and, therefore, ultimately, in the poetic expression of Jawa harlal Nehru, the livery of Indias freedom Moreover, khadi mentality means decentralization of the pro duction and distribution of the necessaries of life.
('81', 357, 3, 27, 584364) Therefore, the for 
('81', 358, 0, 1, 584384) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 359
('81', 358, 1, 2, 584431) mula so far evolved is, every village to produce all its necessaries and a certain percentage in addition for the requirements of the cities.
('81', 358, 1, 3, 584573) Heavy industries will needs be centralized and nationalized.
('81', 358, 1, 4, 584634) But they will occupy the least part of the vast national activity which will mainly be in the villages.
('81', 358, 1, 5, 584738) Having explained the implications of khadi, I must indicate what Congressmen can and should do towards its promotion.
('81', 358, 1, 6, 584856) Production of khadi includes cotton growing, picking, ginning, cleaning, carding, slivering, spinning, sizing, dyeing, preparing the warp and the woof, weaving, and washing.
('81', 358, 1, 7, 585030) These, with the exception of dyeing, are essen tial processes.
('81', 358, 1, 8, 585093) Every one of them can be effectively handled in the villages and is being so handled in many villages throughout India, which the A.I.S.A. is covering.
('81', 358, 1, 9, 585245) According to the latest report the following are the interesting figures : 2,75,146 villagers, including 19,654 Harijans and 57,378 Mus lims, scattered in at least 13,451 villages, received, as spinners, weavers, etc., Rs. 34,85,609 in 1940. The spinners were largely women.
('81', 358, 1, 10, 585520) Yet the work done is only one hundredth part of what could be done if Congressmen honestly took up the khadi programme.
('81', 358, 1, 11, 585640) Since the wanton destruction of this central village industry and the allied handicrafts, intelligence and brightness have fled from the villages, leaving them inane, lustreless, and reduced almost to the state of their ill kept cattle.
('81', 358, 1, 12, 585877) If Congressmen will be true to the Congress call in respect of khadi, they will carry out the instructions of the A. I. S. A. issued from time to time as to the part they can play in khadi planning.
('81', 358, 1, 13, 586076) Only a few broad rules can be laid down here : 1. Every family with a plot of ground can grow cotton at least for family use.
('81', 358, 1, 14, 586202) Cotton growing is an easy process.
('81', 358, 1, 15, 586237) In Bihar the cultivators were by law compelled to grow indigo on 3/20 of their cultivable land.
('81', 358, 1, 16, 586333) This was in the interest of the foreign indigo planter.
('81', 358, 1, 17, 586389) Why cannot we grow cotton voluntarily for the nation on a certain portion of our land?
('81', 358, 1, 18, 586476) The reader will note that decentralization commences from the beginning of khadi processes.
('81', 358, 1, 19, 586568) Today cotton crop is centralized and has to be sent to distant parts of India.
('81', 358, 1, 20, 586647) Before the war it used to be sent principally to Britain and Japan.
('81', 358, 1, 21, 586715) It was and still is a money crop and, therefore, subject to the fluctuations of the market.
('81', 358, 1, 22, 586807) Under the khadi scheme cotton growing becomes free from this uncertainty and gamble.
('81', 358, 1, 23, 586892) The grower grows what he needs.
('81', 358, 1, 24, 586924) The farmer needs to know that his first business is to grow for his own needs.
('81', 358, 1, 25, 587003) When he does that, he will reduce the chance of a low market ruining him.
('81', 359, 0, 1, 587077) 360 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 359, 1, 2, 587119) 2. Every spinner would buyif he has not his ownenough cotton for ginning, which he can easily do without the hand ginning roller frame.
('81', 359, 1, 3, 587255) He can gin his own portion with a board and an iron rolling pin.
('81', 359, 1, 4, 587320) Where this is considered impracticable, hand ginned cotton should be bought and carded.
('81', 359, 1, 5, 587408) Carding for self can be done well on a tiny bow without much effort.
('81', 359, 1, 6, 587477) The greater the decentra lization of labour, the simpler and cheaper the tools.
('81', 359, 1, 7, 587557) The slivers made, the process of spinning commences.
('81', 359, 1, 8, 587610) I strongly recommend the dhanush takli.
('81', 359, 1, 9, 587650) I have used it frequently.
('81', 359, 1, 10, 587677) My speed on it is almost the same as on the wheel.
('81', 359, 1, 11, 587728) I draw a finer thread and the strength and the evenness of the yarn are greater on the dhanush takli than on the wheel.
('81', 359, 1, 12, 587848) This may not, however, hold good for all.
('81', 359, 1, 13, 587890) My emphasis on the dhanush takli is based on the fact that it is more easily made, is cheaper than and does not require frequent repairs like the wheel.
('81', 359, 1, 14, 588043) Unless one knows how to make the two mals 1 and to adjust them when they slip or to put the wheel right when it refuses to work, the wheel has often to lie idle.
('81', 359, 1, 15, 588205) Moreover, if the millions take to spinning at once, as they well may have to, 2 the dhanush takli, being the instrument most easily made and handled, is the only that can meet the demand.
('81', 359, 1, 16, 588393) It is more easily made even than the simple takli.
('81', 359, 1, 17, 588444) The best, easiest and cheapest way is to make it oneself.
('81', 359, 1, 18, 588502) Indeed one ought to learn how to handle and make simple tools.
('81', 359, 1, 19, 588565) Imagine the unifying and educative effect of the whole nation simultaneously taking part in the processes up to spinning !
('81', 359, 1, 20, 588688) Consider the levelling effect of the bond of common labour between the rich and the poor !
('81', 359, 1, 21, 588779) Yarn thus produced may be used in three ways : by presenting it to the A.I.S.A. for the sake of the poor, by having it woven for personal use, or by getting as much khadi for it as it can buy.
('81', 359, 1, 22, 588972) It is clear enough that the finer and better the yarn the greater will be its value.
('81', 359, 1, 23, 589057) If Congressmen will put their hearts into the work, they will make improvements in the tools and make many discoveries.
('81', 359, 1, 24, 589177) In our country there has been a divorce between labour and intelligence.
('81', 359, 1, 25, 589250) The result has been stagnation.
('81', 359, 1, 26, 589282) If there is an indissoluble marriage between the two, and that in the manner here suggested, the resultant good will be inestimable.
('81', 359, 1, 27, 589415) In this scheme of nationwide spinning as a sacrifice, I do not expect the average man or woman to give more than one hour daily to this work.
('81', 359, 2, 28, 589557) 1 Straps 2 The first edition here has, even under the stress of war.
('81', 360, 0, 1, 589626) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 361
('81', 360, 1, 2, 589673) 5. OTHER VILLAGE INDUSTRIES
('81', 360, 2, 3, 589701) These stand on a different footing from khadi.
('81', 360, 2, 4, 589748) There is not much scope for voluntary labour in them.
('81', 360, 2, 5, 589802) Each industry will take the labour of only a certain number of hands.
('81', 360, 2, 6, 589872) These industries come in as a handmaid to khadi.
('81', 360, 2, 7, 589921) They cannot exist without khadi, and khadi will be robbed of its dignity without them.
('81', 360, 2, 8, 590008) Village economy cannot be complete without the essential village industries such as hand grind ing, hand pounding, soap making, paper making, match making, tanning, oil pressing, etc.
('81', 360, 2, 9, 590192) Congressmen can interest themselves in these and, if they are villagers or will settle down in villages, they will give these industries a new life and a new dress.
('81', 360, 2, 10, 590357) All should make it a point of honour to use only village articles whenever and wher ever available.
('81', 360, 2, 11, 590457) Given the demand there is no doubt that most of our wants can be supplied from our villages.
('81', 360, 2, 12, 590550) When we have become village minded , we will not want imitations of the West or machine made products, but we will develop a true national taste in keeping with the vision of a new India in which pauperism, starvation and idleness will be unknown.
('81', 360, 3, 13, 590798) 6. VILLAGE SANITATION
('81', 360, 4, 14, 590820) Divorce between intelligence and labour has resulted in criminal negligence of the villages.
('81', 360, 4, 15, 590913) And so, instead of having graceful hamlets dotting the land, we have dung heaps.
('81', 360, 4, 16, 590994) The approach to many villages is not a refreshing experience.
('81', 360, 4, 17, 591056) Often one would like to shut ones eyes and stuff ones nose; such is the surrounding dirt and offending smell.
('81', 360, 4, 18, 591166) If the majority of Congressmen were derived from our villages, as they should be, they should be able to make our villages models of cleanliness in every sense of the word.
('81', 360, 4, 19, 591339) But they have never considered it their duty to identify themselves with the villagers in their daily lives.
('81', 360, 4, 20, 591448) A sense of national or social sanitation is not a virtue among us.
('81', 360, 4, 21, 591515) We may take a kind of a bath, but we do not mind dirtying the well or the tank or river by whose side or in which we perform ablutions.
('81', 360, 4, 22, 591651) I regard this defect as a great vice which is responsible for the disgraceful state of our villages and the sacred banks of the sacred rivers and for diseases that spring from insanitation.
('81', 360, 5, 23, 591841) 7. NEW OR BASIC EDUCATION
('81', 360, 6, 24, 591867) This is a new subject.
('81', 360, 6, 25, 591890) But the members of the Working Committee felt so much interested in it that gave a charter to the organizers of the Hindustani Talimi Sangh which has been function ing since the Haripura session 1. This is a big field of work for many
('81', 360, 7, 26, 592125) 1 Of the Congress in 1938
('81', 361, 0, 1, 592151) 362 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 361, 1, 2, 592193) Congressmen.
('81', 361, 1, 3, 592206) This education is meant to transform village children into model villagers.
('81', 361, 1, 4, 592282) It is principally designed for them.
('81', 361, 1, 5, 592319) The inspiration for it has come from the villages.
('81', 361, 1, 6, 592370) Congressmen who want to build up the structure of swaraj from its very foundation dare not neglect the children.
('81', 361, 1, 7, 592483) Foreign rule has unconsciously, though none the less surely, begun with the children in the field of education.
('81', 361, 1, 8, 592595) Primary education is a farce designed without regard to the wants of the India of the villages and for that matter even of the cities.
('81', 361, 1, 9, 592730) Basic education links the children, whether of the cities or the villages, to all that is best and lasting in India.
('81', 361, 1, 10, 592847) It develops both the body and the mind, and keeps the child rooted to the soil with a glorious vision of the future, in the realization of which he or she begins to take his or her share from the very commencement of his or her career in school.
('81', 361, 1, 11, 593093) Congressmen would find it of absorbing interest benefiting themselves equally with the children with whom they come in contact.
('81', 361, 1, 12, 593221) Let those who wish put themselves in touch with the Secretary of the Sangh at Sevagram.
('81', 361, 2, 13, 593309) 8. ADULT EDUCATION This has been woefully neglected by Congressmen.
('81', 361, 2, 14, 593377) Where they have not neglected it, they have been satisfied with teaching illiterates to read and write.
('81', 361, 2, 15, 593481) If I had charge of adult education, I should begin with opening the minds of the adult pupils to the greatness and vastness of their country.
('81', 361, 2, 16, 593623) The villagers India is contained in his village.
('81', 361, 2, 17, 593672) If he goes to another village, he talks of his own village as his home.
('81', 361, 2, 18, 593744) Hindustan is for him a geographical term.
('81', 361, 2, 19, 593786) We have no notion of the ignorance prevailing in the villages.
('81', 361, 2, 20, 593849) The villagers know nothing of foreign rule and its evils.
('81', 361, 2, 21, 593907) What little knowledge they have picked up fills them with the awe the foreigner inspires.
('81', 361, 2, 22, 593997) The result is the dread and hatred of the foreigner and his rule.
('81', 361, 2, 23, 594063) They do not know how to get rid of it.
('81', 361, 2, 24, 594102) They do not know that the foreigners presence is due to their own weaknesses and their ignorance of the power they possess to rid themselves of the foreign rule.
('81', 361, 2, 25, 594264) My adult education means, therefore, first, true political education of the adult by word of mouth.
('81', 361, 2, 26, 594364) Seeing that this will be mapped out, it can be given without fear.
('81', 361, 2, 27, 594431) I imagine that it is too late in the day for authority to interfere with this type of education; but if there is interference, there must be a fight for this elementary right without which there can be no swaraj.
('81', 361, 2, 28, 594644) Of course, in all I have written, openness has been assumed.
('81', 361, 2, 29, 594705) Non violence abhors fear and, therefore, secrecy.
('81', 361, 2, 30, 594755) Side by side with the education by the mouth will be the literary education.
('81', 361, 2, 31, 594832) This is itself a speciality.
('81', 361, 2, 32, 594861) Many methods are being tried in order to shorten the period of education.
('81', 361, 2, 33, 594935) A temporary or permanent board of experts may be appointed by the
('81', 362, 0, 1, 595001) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 363
('81', 362, 1, 2, 595048) Working Committee to give shape to the idea here adumbrated and guide the workers.
('81', 362, 1, 3, 595131) I admit that what I have said in this paragraph only points the way but does not tell the average Congressman how to go about it.
('81', 362, 1, 4, 595261) Nor is every Congressman fitted for this highly special work.
('81', 362, 1, 5, 595323) But Congressmen who are teachers should find no difficulty in laying down a course in keeping with the suggestions made herein.
('81', 362, 1, 6, 595451) 9. WOMEN
('81', 362, 2, 7, 595460) I have included service of women in the constructive pro gramme, for though satyagraha has automatically brought Indias women out from their darkness as nothing else could have in such an incredibly short space of time, Congressmen have not felt the call to see that women become equal partners in the fight for swaraj.
('81', 362, 2, 8, 595780) They have not realized that woman must be the true helpmate of man in the mission of service.
('81', 362, 2, 9, 595874) Woman has been suppressed under custom and law for which man was responsible and in the shaping of which she had no hand.
('81', 362, 2, 10, 595996) In a plan of life based on non violence, woman has as much right to shape her own destiny as man has to shape his.
('81', 362, 2, 11, 596111) But as every right in a non violent society proceeds from the previous performance of a duty, it follows that rules of social conduct must be framed by mutual co operation and consultation.
('81', 362, 2, 12, 596301) They can never be imposed from outside.
('81', 362, 2, 13, 596341) Men have not realized this truth in its fulness in their behaviour towards women.
('81', 362, 2, 14, 596423) They have considered themselves to be lords and masters of women instead of considering them as their friends and co workers.
('81', 362, 2, 15, 596549) It is the privilege of Congressmen to give the women of India a lifting hand.
('81', 362, 2, 16, 596627) Women are in the position somewhat of the slave of old who did not know that he could or ever had to be free.
('81', 362, 2, 17, 596737) And when freedom came, for the moment he felt helpless.
('81', 362, 2, 18, 596793) Women have been taught to regard themselves as slaves of men.
('81', 362, 2, 19, 596855) It is up to Congressmen to see that they enable them to realize their full status and play their part as equals of men.
('81', 362, 2, 20, 596975) This revolution is easy, if the mind is made up.
('81', 362, 2, 21, 597024) Let Congress men begin with their own homes.
('81', 362, 2, 22, 597069) Wives should not be dolls and objects of indulgence, but should be treated as honoured comrades in common service.
('81', 362, 2, 23, 597184) To this end those who have not received a liberal education should receive such instruction as is possible from their husbands.
('81', 362, 2, 24, 597312) The same observation applies, with the necessary changes, to mothers and daughters.
('81', 362, 2, 25, 597396) It is hardly necessary to point out that I have given a onesided picture of the helpless state of Indias women.
('81', 362, 2, 26, 597508) I am quite conscious of the fact that in the villages generally they hold their own with their menfolk and in some respects even rule them.
('81', 362, 2, 27, 597648) But to the impartial
('81', 363, 0, 1, 597669) 364 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 363, 1, 2, 597711) outsider the legal and customary status of woman is bad enough throughout and demands radical alteration.
('81', 363, 2, 3, 597817) 10. EDUCATION IN HEALTH AND HYGIENE
('81', 363, 3, 4, 597853) Having given a place to village sanitation, the question may be asked why give a separate place to education in health and hygiene?
('81', 363, 3, 5, 597985) It might have been bracketed with sanitation, but I did not wish to interfere with the items.
('81', 363, 3, 6, 598079) Mention of mere sanitation is not enough to include health and hygiene.
('81', 363, 3, 7, 598151) The art of keeping ones health and the knowledge of hygiene is by itself a separate subject of study and corresponding practice.
('81', 363, 3, 8, 598280) In a well ordered society the citizens know and observe the laws of health and hygiene.
('81', 363, 3, 9, 598368) It is established beyond doubt that ignorance and neglect of the laws of health and hygiene are responsible for the majority of diseases to which mankind is heir.
('81', 363, 3, 10, 598531) The very high death rate among us is no doubt due largely to our gnawing poverty, but it could be mitigated if the people were properly educated about health and hygiene.
('81', 363, 3, 11, 598702) Mens sana in corpore sano is perhaps the first law for humanity.
('81', 363, 3, 12, 598767) A healthy mind in a healthy body is a self evident truth.
('81', 363, 3, 13, 598825) There is an inevitable connection between mind and body.
('81', 363, 3, 14, 598882) If we were in possession of healthy minds, we would shed all violence and, naturally obeying the laws of health, we would have healthy bodies without an effort.
('81', 363, 3, 15, 599043) I hope, therefore, that no Congressman will disregard this item of the constructive programme.
('81', 363, 3, 16, 599138) The fundamental laws of health and hygiene are simple and easily learnt.
('81', 363, 3, 17, 599211) The difficulty is about their observance.
('81', 363, 3, 18, 599253) Here are some : Think the purest thoughts and banish all idle and impure thoughts.
('81', 363, 3, 19, 599336) Breathe the freshest air day and night.
('81', 363, 3, 20, 599376) Establish a balance between bodily and mental work.
('81', 363, 3, 21, 599428) Stand erect, sit erect, and be neat and clean in every one of your acts, and let these be an expression of your inner condition.
('81', 363, 3, 22, 599557) Eat to live for service of fellow men.
('81', 363, 3, 23, 599596) Do not live for indulging yourselves.
('81', 363, 3, 24, 599634) Hence your food must be just enough to keep your mind and body in good order.
('81', 363, 3, 25, 599712) Man becomes what he eats.
('81', 363, 3, 26, 599738) Your water, food and air must be clean, and you will not be satisfied with mere personal cleanliness, but you will infect your surroundings with the same threefold cleanliness that you will desire for yourselves.
('81', 364, 0, 1, 599951) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 365
('81', 364, 1, 2, 599998) 11. PROVINCIAL LANGUAGES 1
('81', 364, 2, 3, 600025) Our love of the English language in preference to our own mother tongue has caused a deep chasm between the educated and politically minded classes and the masses.
('81', 364, 2, 4, 600189) The languages of India have suffered impoverishment.
('81', 364, 2, 5, 600242) We flounder when we make the vain attempt to express abstruse thought in the mother tongue.
('81', 364, 2, 6, 600334) There are no equivalents for scientific terms.
('81', 364, 2, 7, 600381) The result has been disastrous.
('81', 364, 2, 8, 600413) The masses remain cut off from the modern mind.
('81', 364, 2, 9, 600461) We are too near our own times correctly to measure the disservice caused to India by this neglect of its great languages.
('81', 364, 2, 10, 600583) It is easy enough to understand that unless we undo the mischief the mass mind must remain imprisoned.
('81', 364, 2, 11, 600686) The masses can make no solid contribution to the construction of swaraj.
('81', 364, 2, 12, 600759) It is inherent in swaraj based on non violence that every individual makes his own direct contribution to the Independence movement.
('81', 364, 2, 13, 600892) The masses cannot do this fully unless they understand every step with all its implications.
('81', 364, 2, 14, 600985) This is impossible unless every step is explained in their own languages.
('81', 364, 3, 15, 601059) 12. NATIONAL LANGUAGE
('81', 364, 4, 16, 601081) And then for all India intercourse we need, from among the Indian stock, a language which the largest number of people already know and understand and which the others can easily pick up.
('81', 364, 4, 17, 601269) This language is indisputably Hindi.
('81', 364, 4, 18, 601306) It is spoken and understood by both Hindus and Muslims of the North.
('81', 364, 4, 19, 601375) It is called Urdu when it is written in the Urdu character.
('81', 364, 4, 20, 601435) The Congress, in its famous resolution passed at the Cawnpore session in 1925, called this all India speech Hindustani.
('81', 364, 4, 21, 601555) And since that time, in theory at least, Hindustani has been the Rashtra bhasha.
('81', 364, 4, 22, 601636) I say in theory because even Congressmen have not practised it as they should have.
('81', 364, 4, 23, 601720) 2 In 1920 a deliberate attempt was begun to recognize the importance of Indian languages for the political education of the masses, as also of an all India common speech which politically minded India could easily speak and which Congressmen from the different provinces could understand at all India gatherings of the Congress.
('81', 364, 4, 24, 602049) Such national language should enable one to understand and speak both forms of speech and write in both the scripts.
('81', 364, 4, 25, 602166) I am sorry to have to say that many Congressmen have failed to carry out that resolution.
('81', 364, 4, 26, 602256) And so we have, in my opinion, the shameful
('81', 364, 5, 27, 602300) 1 In the first edition this and the following topic are discussed under the heading Propaganda of Rashtrabhasha.
('81', 364, 5, 28, 602413) 2 The first edition here adds : The picture that I have drawn in this paragraph is true to life as it was before 1920.
('81', 365, 0, 1, 602532) 366 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 365, 1, 2, 602574) spectacle of Congressmen insisting on speaking in English and compelling others to do likewise for their sakes.
('81', 365, 1, 3, 602686) The spell that English has cast on us is not yet broken.
('81', 365, 1, 4, 602743) Being under it, we are impeding the progress of India towards her goal.
('81', 365, 1, 5, 602815) Our love of the masses must be skin deep, if we will not take the trouble of spending over learning Hindustani as many months as the years we spend over learning English.
('81', 365, 2, 6, 602986) 13. ECONOMIC EQUALITY
('81', 365, 3, 7, 603008) This last is the master key to non violent independence.
('81', 365, 3, 8, 603065) Work ing for economic equality means abolishing the eternal conflict between capital and labour.
('81', 365, 3, 9, 603162) It means the levelling down of the few rich in whose hands is concentrated the bulk of the nations wealth on the one hand, and the levelling up of the semi starved naked millions on the other.
('81', 365, 3, 10, 603355) A non violent system of government is clearly an impossibility so long as the wide gulf between the rich and the hungry millions persists.
('81', 365, 3, 11, 603494) The contrast between the palaces of New Delhi and the miserable hovels of the poor labouring class nearby cannot last one day in a free India in which the poor will enjoy the same power as the richest in the land.
('81', 365, 3, 12, 603708) A violent and bloody revolution is a certainty one day unless there is a voluntary abdication of riches and the power that riches give and sharing them for the common good.
('81', 365, 3, 13, 603881) I adhere to my doctrine of trusteeship in spite of the ridicule that has been poured upon it.
('81', 365, 3, 14, 603975) It is true that it is difficult to reach.
('81', 365, 3, 15, 604017) So is non violence.
('81', 365, 3, 16, 604037) But we made up our minds in 1920 to negotiate that steep ascent.
('81', 365, 3, 17, 604102) We have found it worth the effort.
('81', 365, 3, 18, 604137) It involves a daily growing appreciation of the working of non violence.
('81', 365, 3, 19, 604210) It is expected that Congrssmen will make a diligent search and reason out for themselves the why and the wherefore of 2 non violence.
('81', 365, 3, 20, 604344) They should ask themselves how the existing inequalities can be abolished violently or non violently.
('81', 365, 3, 21, 604446) I think we know the violent way.
('81', 365, 3, 22, 604479) It has not succeeded anywhere.
('81', 365, 4, 23, 604510) 1 The first edition here has the following additional paragraph: Love of ones own language: I need hardly add anything to what I have said in the foregoing paragraph.
('81', 365, 4, 24, 604677) The two propositions hang together for those who view India as one country. 2 The first edition has after this: what they are called upon to do, and adds: They may not be satisfied with the mere conformity, honest or half hearted, with the instructions issued from time to time. 3 The first edition here adds: Some claim that it has in Russia in a large measure.
('81', 365, 4, 25, 605040) I doubt it.
('81', 365, 4, 26, 605052) It is too early to make an unchallengeable claim.
('81', 365, 4, 27, 605102) And now that the war has broken out between Russia and Germany, we are unable to say what the ultimate result will be.
('81', 366, 0, 1, 605221) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 367
('81', 366, 1, 2, 605268) This non violent experiment is still in the making.
('81', 366, 1, 3, 605320) We have nothing much yet to show by way of demonstration.
('81', 366, 1, 4, 605378) It is certain, however, that the method has begun to work though ever so slowly in the direction of equality.
('81', 366, 1, 5, 605488) And since non violence is a process of conversion, the conversion, if achieved, must be permanent.
('81', 366, 1, 6, 605587) A society or a nation constructed non violently must be able to withstand attack upon its structure from without or within.
('81', 366, 1, 7, 605711) We have moneyed Congressmen in the organization.
('81', 366, 1, 8, 605760) They have to lead the way.
('81', 366, 1, 9, 605787) This fight 1 provides an opportunity for the closest heart searching on the part of every individual Congressman.
('81', 366, 1, 10, 605901) If ever we are to achieve equality, the foundation has to be laid now.
('81', 366, 1, 11, 605972) Those who think that major reforms will come after the advent of swaraj are deceiving themselves as to the elementary working of non violent swaraj.
('81', 366, 1, 12, 606121) It will not drop from heaven all of a sudden one fine morning.
('81', 366, 1, 13, 606184) But it has to be built up brick by brick by corporate self effort.
('81', 366, 1, 14, 606251) We have travelled a fair way in that direction.
('81', 366, 1, 15, 606299) But a much longer and weary distance has to be covered before we can behold swaraj in its glorious majesty.
('81', 366, 1, 16, 606407) Every Congressman has to ask himself what he has done towards the attainment of economic equality.
('81', 366, 2, 17, 606506) 14. KISANS 2
('81', 366, 3, 18, 606519) The programme is not exhaustive.
('81', 366, 3, 19, 606552) Swaraj is a mighty structure.
('81', 366, 3, 20, 606582) Eighty crores of hands have to work at building it.
('81', 366, 3, 21, 606634) 3 Of these kisans, i.e., the peasantry, are the largest part.
('81', 366, 3, 22, 606696) In fact, being the bulk of them (probably over 80%) the kisans should be the Congress.
('81', 366, 3, 23, 606783) But they are not.
('81', 366, 3, 24, 606801) When they become conscious of their non violent strength, no power on earth can resist them.
('81', 366, 4, 25, 606894) 1 The first edition here adds, which is conceived as the last. 2 In the first edition this and the succeeding two topics, viz., Labour and Students, are discussed under a single heading Kisan, Labour and Students, which begins as follows: I have now finished the inquiry about the thirteen items of the constructive programme.
('81', 366, 4, 26, 607221) I have attempted to show how each item fits in with the scheme of swaraj and how it can be worked by individual Congressmen.
('81', 366, 4, 27, 607346) 3 The first edition here has: Therefore, many other items of a piece with the thirteen can be added, the centre being always the charkha round which all other activities should come from the charkha.
('81', 366, 4, 28, 607546) The reader will notice, as some of my co workers have noticed, the absence of any reference of kisans, factory hands or labour and students.
('81', 366, 4, 29, 607687) I have deliberately avoided reference to their work as parts of the constructive programme.
('81', 366, 4, 30, 607779) They have to work the thirteen items same as any other worker in the cause.
('81', 366, 4, 31, 607855) My avoidance is not intended to belittle the part they can play in the movement.
('81', 366, 4, 32, 607936) I am quite conscious of the great importance they have in the movement for freedom.
('81', 366, 4, 33, 608020) The question underlying the inquiry is who is to organize them and how.
('81', 367, 0, 1, 608092) 368 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 367, 1, 2, 608134) They must not be used for power politics.
('81', 367, 1, 3, 608176) 1 I consider it to be contrary to the non violent method.
('81', 367, 1, 4, 608234) Those who would know my method of organizing kisans may profitably study the movement in Champaran when satyagraha was tried for the first time in India with the result all India knows.
('81', 367, 1, 5, 608420) It became a mass movement which remained wholly non violent from start to finish.
('81', 367, 1, 6, 608502) It affected over twenty lakhs of kisans.
('81', 367, 1, 7, 608543) The struggle centred round one specific grievance which was a century old.
('81', 367, 1, 8, 608618) There had been several violent revolts to get rid of the grievance.
('81', 367, 1, 9, 608686) The kisans were suppressed.
('81', 367, 1, 10, 608714) The non violent remedy succeeded in full in six months.
('81', 367, 1, 11, 608770) The kisans of Champaran became politically conscious without any direct effort.
('81', 367, 1, 12, 608850) The tangible proof they had of the working of non violence to remove their grievances drew them to the Congress and led by Babu Brijkishore Prasad and Babu Rajendra Prasad they gave a good account of themselves during the past civil disobedience campaigns.
('81', 367, 1, 13, 609107) The reader may also profitably study the kisan movements in Kheda , Bardoli and Borsad .
('81', 367, 1, 14, 609196) The secret of success lies in a refusal to exploit the kisans for political purposes outside their own personal and felt grievances.
('81', 367, 1, 15, 609329) Organization round a specific wrong they understand.
('81', 367, 1, 16, 609382) They need no sermons on non violence.
('81', 367, 1, 17, 609420) Let them learn to apply non violence as an effective remedy which they can under stand, and later when they are told that the method they were applying was non violent, they readily recognize it as such.
('81', 367, 1, 18, 609624) Form these illustrations Congressmen who care could study how work can be done for and among kisans.
('81', 367, 1, 19, 609725) I hold that the method that some Congressmen have followed to organize kisans has done them no good and has probably harmed them.
('81', 367, 1, 20, 609855) Anyway they have not used the non violent method.
('81', 367, 1, 21, 609905) Be it said to the credit of some of these workers that they frankly admit that they do not believe in the non violent method.
('81', 367, 1, 22, 610031) My advice to such workers would be that they should neither use the Congress name nor work as Congressmen.
('81', 367, 1, 23, 610138) The reader will now understand why I have refrained from the competition to organize kisans and labour on an all India basis.
('81', 367, 1, 24, 610264) How I wish that all hands pulled in the same direction !
('81', 367, 1, 25, 610321) But perhaps in a huge country like ours it is impossible.
('81', 367, 1, 26, 610379) Anyway, in non violence there is no coercion.
('81', 367, 1, 27, 610425) Cold reason and demonstration of the working of non violence must be trusted to do the work.
('81', 367, 1, 28, 610518) In my opinion, like labour, they should have under the Congress a department working for their specific questions.
('81', 367, 2, 29, 610633) 1 The first edition here has: About the kisan movement too, there is, I fear, an ugly competition to use kisans for power politics.
('81', 368, 0, 1, 610765) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 369
('81', 368, 1, 2, 610812) 15. LABOUR
('81', 368, 2, 3, 610823) Ahmedabad Labour Union is a model for all India to copy.
('81', 368, 2, 4, 610880) 1Its basis is non violence, pure and simple.
('81', 368, 2, 5, 610925) It has never had a set back in its career.
('81', 368, 2, 6, 610968) It has gone on from strength to strength without fuss and without show.
('81', 368, 2, 7, 611040) It has its hospital, its school for the children of the mill hands, its classes for adults, its own printing press and khadi depot, and its own residential quarters.
('81', 368, 2, 8, 611206) Almost all the hands are voters and decide the fate of elections.
('81', 368, 2, 9, 611272) They came on the voters list at the instance of the Provincial Congress Committee.
('81', 368, 2, 10, 611355) The organization has never taken part in party politics of the Congress.
('81', 368, 2, 11, 611428) It influences the municipal policy of the city.
('81', 368, 2, 12, 611476) It has to its credit very successful strikes which were wholly non violent.
('81', 368, 2, 13, 611552) Mill owners and labour have governed their relations largely through voluntary arbitration.
('81', 368, 2, 14, 611644) If I had my way, I would regulate all the labour organizations of India after the Ahmedabad model.
('81', 368, 2, 15, 611743) It has never sought to intrude itself upon the All India Trade Union Congress and has been uninfluenced by that Congress.
('81', 368, 2, 16, 611865) A time, I hope, will come when it will be possible for the Trade Union Congress to accept the Ahmedabad method and have the Ahmedabad organization as part of the All India Union.
('81', 368, 2, 17, 612044) But I am in no hurry.
('81', 368, 2, 18, 612066) It will come in its own time.
('81', 368, 3, 19, 612096) 16. ADIVASIS2
('81', 368, 4, 20, 612110) The term adivasi, like raniparaj 3, is a coined word.
('81', 368, 4, 21, 612164) Raniparaj stands for kaliparaj (meaning black people, though their skin is no more black than that of any other).
('81', 368, 4, 22, 612278) It was conined, I think, by Shri Jugatram.
('81', 368, 4, 23, 612321) The term adivasi (for Bhils, Gonds, or others variously described as Hill Tribes or aboriginals) means literally original inhabitants and was coined, I believe, by Thakkar Bapa.
('81', 368, 4, 24, 612499) Service of adivasis is also a part of the constructive programme.
('81', 368, 4, 25, 612565) Though they are the sixteenth number in this programme, they are not the least in point of importance.
('81', 368, 4, 26, 612668) Our country is so vast and the races so varied that the best of us cannot know all there is to know of men and their condition.
('81', 368, 4, 27, 612796) As one discovers this for oneself, one realizes how difficult it is to make good our claim to be one nation,
('81', 368, 5, 28, 612905) 1 The first edition here has : As to labour, I am responsible for the organization of Ahmedabad labour.
('81', 368, 5, 29, 613009) I am of the opinion that it is a model for all India to copy. 2 The first edition does not have this and the following topic.
('81', 368, 5, 30, 613135) 3 Forest people
('81', 369, 0, 1, 613151) 370 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 369, 1, 2, 613193) unless every unit has a living consciousness of being one with every other.
('81', 369, 1, 3, 613269) The adivasis are over two crores in all India.
('81', 369, 1, 4, 613316) Bapa began work among the Bhils years ago in Gujarat.
('81', 369, 1, 5, 613370) In about 1940 Shri Balasaheb Kher threw himself with his usual zeal into this much needed service in the Thana District.
('81', 369, 1, 6, 613491) He is now President of the Adivasi Seva Mandal.
('81', 369, 1, 7, 613539) There are several such other workers in other parts of India and yet are too few.
('81', 369, 1, 8, 613621) Truly, the harvest is rich but the labourers are few.
('81', 369, 1, 9, 613675) Who can deny that all such service is not merely humanitarian but solidly national, and brings us nearer to true independence?
('81', 369, 1, 10, 613802) 17. LEPERS
('81', 369, 2, 11, 613813) Leper is a word of bad odour.
('81', 369, 2, 12, 613843) India is perhaps a home of lepers next only to Central Africa.
('81', 369, 2, 13, 613906) Yet they are as much a part of society as the tallest among us.
('81', 369, 2, 14, 613970) But the tall absorb our attention though they are least in need of it.
('81', 369, 2, 15, 614041) The lot of the lepers who are much in need of attention is studied neglect.
('81', 369, 2, 16, 614117) I am tempted to call it heartless, which it certainly is in terms of non violence.
('81', 369, 2, 17, 614200) It is largely the missionary who, be it said to his credit, bestows care on him.
('81', 369, 2, 18, 614281) The only institution run by an Indian, as a pure labour of love, is by Shri Manohar Diwan near Wardha.
('81', 369, 2, 19, 614384) It is working under the inspiration and guidance of Shri Vinoba Bhave.
('81', 369, 2, 20, 614455) If India was pulsating with new life, if we were all in earnest about winning independence in the quickest manner possible by truthful and non violent means, there would not be a leper or beggar in India uncared for and unaccounted for.
('81', 369, 2, 21, 614692) In this revised edition I am deliberately introducing the leper as a link in the chain of constructive effort.
('81', 369, 2, 22, 614803) For what the leper is in India, that we are, if we put look about us, for the modern civilized world.
('81', 369, 2, 23, 614905) Examine the condition of our brethren across the ocean and the truth of my remark will be borne home to us.
('81', 369, 2, 24, 615013) 18. STUDENTS
('81', 369, 3, 25, 615026) I have reserved students to the last.
('81', 369, 3, 26, 615064) I have always cultivated close contact with them.
('81', 369, 3, 27, 615114) They know me and I know them.
('81', 369, 3, 28, 615144) They have given me service.
('81', 369, 3, 29, 615172) Many ex collegians are my esteemed co workers.
('81', 369, 3, 30, 615219) I know that they are the hope of the future.
('81', 369, 3, 31, 615264) In the heyday of non co operation they were invited to leave their schools and colleges.
('81', 369, 3, 32, 615353) Some professors and students who responded to the Congress call have remained steadfast and gained much for the country and themselves.
('81', 369, 3, 33, 615489) The call has not been repeated for there is not the atmosphere for it.
('81', 369, 3, 34, 615560) But experience has shown that the lure of the current education, though it is false and unnatural, is too much for the youth of the
('81', 370, 0, 1, 615692) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 371
('81', 370, 1, 2, 615739) country.
('81', 370, 1, 3, 615748) College education provides a career.
('81', 370, 1, 4, 615785) It is a passport for entrance to the charmed circle.
('81', 370, 1, 5, 615838) Pardonable hunger for knowledge cannot be satisfied otherwise than by going through the usual rut.
('81', 370, 1, 6, 615937) They do not mind the waste of precious years in acquiring knowledge of an utterly foreign language which takes the place of the mother tongue.
('81', 370, 1, 7, 616080) The sin of it is never felt.
('81', 370, 1, 8, 616109) They and their teachers have made up their minds that the indigenous languages are useless for gaining access to modern thought and the modern sciences.
('81', 370, 1, 9, 616262) I wonder how the Japanese are faring.
('81', 370, 1, 10, 616300) For their education, I understand, is all given in Japanese.
('81', 370, 1, 11, 616361) The Chinese Generalissimo knows very little, if anything, of English.
('81', 370, 1, 12, 616431) But such as the students are, it is from these young men and women that the future leaders of the nation are to rise.
('81', 370, 1, 13, 616549) Unfortunately they are acted upon by every variety of influences.
('81', 370, 1, 14, 616615) Non violence offers them little attraction.
('81', 370, 1, 15, 616659) A blow for a blow or two for one is an easily understandable proposition.
('81', 370, 1, 16, 616733) It seems to yield immediate result though momentary.
('81', 370, 1, 17, 616786) It is a never ending trial of brute strength as we see in time of war among brutes or among human beings.
('81', 370, 1, 18, 616892) Appre ciation of non violence means patient research and still more patient and difficult practice.
('81', 370, 1, 19, 616992) I have not entered the list of competitors for the students hand, for the reasons that have dictated my course about kisans and labour.
('81', 370, 1, 20, 617128) But I am myself a fellow student, using the word in its broader sense.
('81', 370, 1, 21, 617199) My university is different from theirs.
('81', 370, 1, 22, 617239) They have a standing invitation from me to come to my university and join me in my search.
('81', 370, 1, 23, 617330) Here are the terms : 1. Students must not take part in party politics.
('81', 370, 1, 24, 617401) They are students, searchers, not politicians.
('81', 370, 1, 25, 617448) 2. They may not resort to political strikes.
('81', 370, 1, 26, 617493) They must have their heroes, but their devotion to them is to be shown by copying the best in their heroes, not by going on strikes, if the heroes are imprisoned or die or are even sent to the gallows.
('81', 370, 1, 27, 617695) If their grief is unbearable and if all the students feel equally, schools or colleges may be closed on such occasions, with the consent of their principals.
('81', 370, 1, 28, 617853) If the principals will not listen, it is open to the students to leave their institutions in a becoming manner till the managers repent and recall them.
('81', 370, 1, 29, 618006) On no account may they use coercion against dissentients of against the authorities.
('81', 370, 1, 30, 618091) They must have the confidence that if they are united and dignified in their conduct, they are sure to win.
('81', 370, 1, 31, 618199) 3. They must all do sacrificial spinning in a scientific manner.
('81', 370, 1, 32, 618264) Their tools shall be always neat, clean, and in good order and condition.
('81', 370, 1, 33, 618338) If possible, they will learn to make them themselves.
('81', 370, 1, 34, 618392) Their yarn will naturally be of the highest quality.
('81', 370, 1, 35, 618445) They will study the
('81', 371, 0, 1, 618465) 372 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 371, 1, 2, 618507) literature about spinning with all its economic, social, moral and political implications.
('81', 371, 1, 3, 618598) 4. They will be khadi users all through and use village pro ducts to the exclusion of all analogous things, foreign or machine made.
('81', 371, 1, 4, 618731) 5. They may not impose Vandemataram or the national flag on others.
('81', 371, 1, 5, 618799) They may wear national flag buttons on their own persons but not force others to do the same.
('81', 371, 1, 6, 618893) 6. They can enforce the message of the tricolour flag in their own persons and harbour neither communalism nor untouchability in their hearts.
('81', 371, 1, 7, 619036) They will cultivate real friendship with students of other faiths and with Harijans as if they were their own kith and kin.
('81', 371, 1, 8, 619160) 7. They will make it a point to give first aid to their injured neighbours and do scavenging and cleaning in the neighbouring villages and instruct village children and adults.
('81', 371, 1, 9, 619337) 8. They will learn the national language, Hindustani, in its present double dress, two forms of speech and two scripts, so that they may feel at home whether Hindi or Urdu is spoken and Nagari or Urdu script is written.
('81', 371, 1, 10, 619557) 9. They will translate into their own mother tongue everything new they may learn, and transmit it in their weekly rounds to the surrounding villages.
('81', 371, 1, 11, 619708) 10. They will do nothing in secret, they will be above board in all their dealings, they will lead a pure life of self restraint, shed all fear and be always ready to protect their weak fellow students, and be ready to quell riots by non violent conduct at the risk of their lives.
('81', 371, 1, 12, 619990) And when the final heat of the struggle comes, they will leave their institutions and, if need be, sacrifice themselves for the freedom of their country.
('81', 371, 1, 13, 620144) 11. They will be scrupulously correct and chivalrous in their behaviour towards their girl fellow students.
('81', 371, 1, 14, 620252) For working out the programme I have sketched for them, the students must find time.
('81', 371, 1, 15, 620337) I know that they waste a great deal of time in idleness.
('81', 371, 1, 16, 620394) By strict economy, they can save many hours.
('81', 371, 1, 17, 620439) But I do not want to put an undue strain upon any student.
('81', 371, 1, 18, 620498) I would, therefore, advise patriotic students to lose one year, not at a stretch but spread it over their whole study.
('81', 371, 1, 19, 620617) They will find that one year so given will not be a waste of time.
('81', 371, 1, 20, 620684) The effort will add to their equipment, mental, moral and physical, and they will have made even during their studies a substantial contribution to the freedom movement.
('81', 372, 0, 1, 620854) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 373
('81', 372, 1, 2, 620901) PLACE OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE
('81', 372, 2, 3, 620929) I have said in these pages that civil disobedience is not absolutely necessary to win freedom through purely non violent effort, if the co operation of the whole nation is secured in the constructive programme.
('81', 372, 2, 4, 621140) But such good luck rarely favours nations or individuals.
('81', 372, 2, 5, 621198) Therefore, it is necessary to know the place of civil disobedience in a nationwide non violent effort.
('81', 372, 2, 6, 621301) It has three definite functions : 1. It can be effectively offered for the redress of a local wrong.
('81', 372, 2, 7, 621402) 2. It can be offered without regard to effect, though aimed at a particular wrong or evil, by way of self immolation in order to rouse local consciousness or conscience.
('81', 372, 2, 8, 621572) Such was the case in Champaran when I offered civil disobedience without any regard to the effect and well knowing that even the people might remain apathetic.
('81', 372, 2, 9, 621732) That it proved otherwise may be taken, according to taste, as Gods grace or a stroke of good luck.
('81', 372, 2, 10, 621831) 3. In the place of full response to constructive effort, it can be offered as it was in 1941 1. Though it was a contribution to and part of the battle for freedom, it was purposely centred round a particular issue, i.e., free speech.
('81', 372, 2, 11, 622065) Civil disobedience can never be directed for a general cause such as for independence.
('81', 372, 2, 12, 622152) The issue must be definite and capable of being clearly understood and within the power of the opponent to yield.
('81', 372, 2, 13, 622266) This method properly applied must lead to the final goal.
('81', 372, 2, 14, 622324) I have not examined here the full scope and possibilities of civil disobedience.
('81', 372, 2, 15, 622405) I have touched enough of it to enable the reader to understand the connection between the constructive programme and civil disobedience.
('81', 372, 2, 16, 622542) In the first two cases, no elaborate constructive programme was or could be necessary.
('81', 372, 2, 17, 622629) But when civil disobedience is itself devised for the attainment of independence, previous preparation is necessary, and it has to be backed by the visible and conscious effort of those who are engaged in the battle.
('81', 372, 2, 18, 622846) Civil disobedience is thus a stimulation for the fighters and a challenge to the opponent.
('81', 372, 2, 19, 622937) It should be clear to the reader that civil disobedience in terms of independence without the co operation of the millions by way of constructive effort is mere bravado and worse than useless.
('81', 372, 3, 20, 623130) CONCLUSION
('81', 372, 4, 21, 623141) This is not a thesis written on behalf of the Congress or at the instance of the Central Office.
('81', 372, 4, 22, 623238) It is the outcome of conversations I had

('81', 373, 1, 2, 623387) with some co workers in Sevagram.
('81', 373, 1, 3, 623421) They had felt the want of some thing from my pen showing the connection between the constructive programme and civil disobedience and how the former might be worked.
('81', 373, 1, 4, 623587) I have endeavoured to supply the want in this pamphlet.
('81', 373, 1, 5, 623643) It does not purport to be exhaustive, but it is sufficiently indicative of the way the programme should be worked.
('81', 373, 1, 6, 623758) Let not the reader make the mistake of laughing at any of the items as being part of the movement for independence.
('81', 373, 1, 7, 623874) Many people do many things, big and small, without connecting them with non violence or independence.
('81', 373, 1, 8, 623976) They have then their limited value as expected.
('81', 373, 1, 9, 624024) The same man appearing as a civilian may be of no consequence, but appearing in his capacity as General he is a big personage, holding the lives of millions at his mercy.
('81', 373, 1, 10, 624195) Similarly, the charkha in the hands of a poor widow brings a paltry pice to her, in the hands of a Jawaharlal it is an instrument of Indias freedom.
('81', 373, 1, 11, 624344) It is the office which gives the charkha its dignity.
('81', 373, 1, 12, 624398) It is the office assigned to the constructive programme which gives it an irresistible prestige and power.
('81', 373, 1, 13, 624505) Such at least is my view.
('81', 373, 1, 14, 624531) It may be that of a mad man.
('81', 373, 1, 15, 624560) If it makes no appeal to the Congressman, I must be rejected.
('81', 373, 1, 16, 624622) For my handling of civil disobedience without the constructive programme will be like a paralysed hand attempting to lift a spoon.

('81', 373, 4, 19, 624823) Shri Jajuji writes : 1
('81', 373, 5, 20, 624846) All these are good points.
('81', 373, 5, 21, 624873) They have also been pretty well discussed.
('81', 373, 5, 22, 624916) But some questions are raised again and again and need to be discussed again and again.
('81', 373, 5, 23, 625004) I shall answer the questions in the order in which they have been asked.
('81', 373, 5, 24, 625077) (1) The question of violence and non violence does arise, for there is violent silk and non violent silk.
('81', 373, 5, 25, 625183) The best thing of course is for people who like to consider everything from the point of view of
('81', 373, 6, 26, 625280) 1 The letter is not translated here.
('81', 373, 6, 27, 625317) Shrikrishnadas Jaju, Secretary, All India Spinners Association, had formulated the following views and sought Gandhijis opinion on them : (1) Bearing in mind that sericulture involves violence, the worker should give it at best secondary importance; (2) silk competes with fine khadi; (3) it tends to make people luxury loving; and (4) it calls for a much larger capital outlay.
('81', 374, 0, 1, 625696) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 375
('81', 374, 1, 2, 625743) non violence to give up silk altogether.
('81', 374, 1, 3, 625784) But from the point of view of khadi we should not raise this question.
('81', 374, 1, 4, 625855) We should stock both kinds of silk in our bhandars, though we should give encouragement only to non violent silk.
('81', 374, 1, 5, 625969) (2) We should never allow silk to reach a point where it can compete with khadi.
('81', 374, 1, 6, 626050) The idea behind giving a place to silk was that it should supplement khadi.
('81', 374, 1, 7, 626126) It has also been the view that hand spun silk is always to be preferred to foreign silk and silk manufactured in Indian mills.
('81', 374, 1, 8, 626253) But silk must never be given the place of cotton cloth.
('81', 374, 1, 9, 626309) That is why a limit has been put upon the quantity of silk to be stocked in khadi bhandars.
('81', 374, 1, 10, 626401) (3) This is not an important point.
('81', 374, 1, 11, 626437) In a way even Andhra khadi, coloured khadi and khadi with woven designs make us luxury loving.
('81', 374, 1, 12, 626532) Khadi is as much for the fastidious as it is for the poor.
('81', 374, 1, 13, 626591) From the very beginning it has been our endeavour to introduce into khadi as much beauty and decoration as we can.
('81', 374, 1, 14, 626706) We display this at every khadi exhibition.
('81', 374, 1, 15, 626749) We have been showing progress in the appearance of khadi every year.
('81', 374, 1, 16, 626818) This was and still is the correct [attitude].
('81', 374, 1, 17, 626864) Khadi mindedness does not mean that art and design should have no place in khadi, and that it is to be only the attire of the poor.
('81', 374, 1, 18, 626996) Therefore the restraint we should place on ourselves here is that we should put what art and design we can into khadi and be satisfied.
('81', 374, 1, 19, 627132) From this point of view silk is to be and should be discarded.
('81', 374, 1, 20, 627195) From this point of view too we compare the fine Andhra khadi with silk.
('81', 374, 1, 21, 627267) Then the silk lovers say they find silk cheaper than the Andhra khadi.
('81', 374, 1, 22, 627338) I answer that we cannot advance the work of khadi in this way.
('81', 374, 1, 23, 627401) Khadi, though it may be costly, comes out cheap in the end.
('81', 374, 1, 24, 627461) (4) If silk making calls for twice as large a capital outlay, we have a very strong reason for giving it up.
('81', 374, 1, 25, 627570) But having regard to human nature we do not or cannot wholly renounce silk.
('81', 374, 1, 26, 627646) In our definition of khadi we have given a place to hand spun silk and hand spun wool.
('81', 374, 1, 27, 627733) But we cannot encourage woollens and silk with a view to increasing profits.
('81', 374, 1, 28, 627810) There will have to be some restraint in regard to these.
('81', 374, 1, 29, 627867) Service of the millions is possible only through cotton khadi.

('81', 378, 8, 14, 631909) MY DEAR AMRITLAL, Of course I will try to show you how utterly wrong you are.
('81', 378, 8, 15, 631987) But when a man believes in a different philosophy from the one another subscribes to, it is difficult for that other to carry conviction.
('81', 378, 8, 16, 632125) Such is my plight.
('81', 378, 8, 17, 632144) You quote from the Bible but your application is quite new and utterly selfish.
('81', 378, 8, 18, 632224) You turn a donation into a debt.
('81', 378, 8, 19, 632257) What is to be done?
('81', 378, 8, 20, 632277) I brought you out of Bengal because you were disgusted and now you think that you did me a favour in coming out.
('81', 378, 8, 21, 632390) Of course a labourer is worthy of his hire.
('81', 378, 8, 22, 632434) You want money without work.
('81', 378, 8, 23, 632463) And when you do work, you want more than the highest you and I have agreed upon, viz., 8 as.
('81', 378, 8, 24, 632556) for 8 hours work.
('81', 378, 8, 25, 632574) But you think you have a claim upon me, i.e., society, for Rs. 2 12 per day for practically very little work.
('81', 378, 8, 26, 632684) Let me not be misunderstood.
('81', 378, 8, 27, 632713) I know Abha is doing something, so also perhaps you.
('81', 378, 8, 28, 632766) But your letter shows that even if all of you were doing nothing, you will claim the above amount as if it was a right.
('81', 378, 8, 29, 632886) I suggest to you that you are wholly wrong in making the claim and defending it on high morality.
('81', 378, 8, 30, 632984) My notion is different.
('81', 378, 8, 31, 633008) I must not carry the argument any further.
('81', 378, 8, 32, 633051) God will give you light if you are humble and will seek it in the right spirit.

('81', 379, 4, 7, 633491) 1 You would certainly have money in Baroda, but your Prince may have to sell his soul there.
('81', 379, 4, 8, 633584) Occasions may arise in Indian States when, if you refuse to obey the States order, you would in no time find yourself disgraced.
('81', 379, 4, 9, 633713) That is why, when an opportunity arose earlier, it was decided that a hundred rupees else where would be preferable to a lakh in an Indian State.
('81', 379, 4, 10, 633859) You will not get elsewhere the opportunity for service which you two have in Kashi.
('81', 379, 4, 11, 633943) Did you not know, when you decided to marry Shankar, that he was a poor mans son and had grown up in simplicity, that he was a man of self respect and that he would be prepared to sacrifice his all for the sake of his honour?
('81', 379, 4, 12, 634169) Yes, he might welcome comfort if he can have it by straightforward means.
('81', 379, 4, 13, 634243) Perhaps there is this difference between Kaka and him.
('81', 379, 4, 14, 634298) See that you do not tempt Shankar.
('81', 379, 4, 15, 634333) If he is patient, he will rise where he is at present.
('81', 379, 4, 16, 634388) What he earns is enough to meet your needs.
('81', 379, 4, 17, 634432) Have patience.
('81', 379, 4, 18, 634447) Remember the line Be equiminded in happiness and suffering, for they are born with the body, and let Shankar follow his straight path.
('81', 379, 4, 19, 634582) You and Baby will be well.
('81', 379, 4, 20, 634609) I have written at greater length than I had intended.
('81', 379, 4, 21, 634663) Of course I could not afford the time, but, then, it was you !

('81', 381, 11, 20, 636726) 638. SPEECH AT A. I. S. A. MEETING BARDOLI, December 17, 1941 I had received Jajujis letter 2 many days ago.
('81', 381, 11, 21, 636835) I liked many things in the letter.
('81', 381, 11, 22, 636870) But I feel that we should have some discussion on the letter today.
('81', 381, 11, 23, 636938) If I were to put down the things that Jajuji has said in his letter, my language would have been a little different though the substance would have been the same.
('81', 381, 11, 24, 637101) The principles he has enunciated are sound.
('81', 381, 11, 25, 637145) It is another matter to what extent they can be put into practice.
('81', 381, 11, 26, 637212) But it is better that we clearly understand the principles.
('81', 381, 11, 27, 637272) When the principles have been clearly formulated we are able to look at things in a uniform way.
('81', 381, 11, 28, 637369) There is then no room left for disagree ments.
('81', 381, 11, 29, 637416) If there is some slackness in practice we must put in more

('81', 381, 13, 31, 637519) 2 Saying that khadi workers did not show the qualities of self sacrifice and hard work required of them
('81', 382, 0, 1, 637623) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 383
('81', 382, 1, 2, 637670) effort.
('81', 382, 1, 3, 637678) What else could we do but make the effort?
('81', 382, 1, 4, 637721) As Jajuji has pointed out, no matter how much khadi we produce, if we have not understood the principles behind khadi, khadi work is bound to languish.
('81', 382, 1, 5, 637873) India wore khadi even before.
('81', 382, 1, 6, 637903) Indeed, we exported khadi to the biggest countries of the world.
('81', 382, 1, 7, 637968) But we cannot pride ourselves upon it today.
('81', 382, 1, 8, 638013) Khadi then was not associated with politics.
('81', 382, 1, 9, 638058) Kings and officials, out of avarice, forced the poor to part with khadi and sold it to make themselves rich.
('81', 382, 1, 10, 638167) This makes it difficult for us even today to explain khadi activity to the masses.
('81', 382, 1, 11, 638250) But today we agree that khadi is the means to our freedom.
('81', 382, 1, 12, 638309) This first occurred to me in 1908. The very thing that was a cause of our slavery will open the door to our freedom.
('81', 382, 1, 13, 638426) We have to understand this.
('81', 382, 1, 14, 638454) We have therefore based khadi on truth and non violence.
('81', 382, 1, 15, 638511) If we forget it and think of producing khadi anyhow, a time will come when we shall be burning khadi.
('81', 382, 1, 16, 638613) No other constructive activity is so much ridiculed and denounced as khadi.
('81', 382, 1, 17, 638689) The coming of the mills has given people all the more occasion to do so.
('81', 382, 1, 18, 638762) In their own way they are justified.
('81', 382, 1, 19, 638799) Since khadi was there in the past, they ask, why did we become slaves.
('81', 382, 1, 20, 638870) How can we treat the same khadi as a means to our freedom?
('81', 382, 1, 21, 638929) It is the duty of the Sangh to answer them.
('81', 382, 1, 22, 638973) This is the question Jajuji has placed before us.
('81', 382, 1, 23, 639023) We have to produce khadi on a large scale.
('81', 382, 1, 24, 639066) We also have to think how.
('81', 382, 1, 25, 639093) But if we forget truth and non violence, no matter how much khadi we may produce, we shall lose it in the end.
('81', 382, 1, 26, 639204) If we do not hold on to the basic thing, impurities will creep in.
('81', 382, 1, 27, 639271) Khadi workers should therefore see that the whole khadi business is kept pure.
('81', 382, 1, 28, 639350) Today when we contemplate producing khadi on a mass scale we ought not to forget the basic thing.
('81', 382, 1, 29, 639448) Today I shall not say that all our spinners too should understand truth and non violence.
('81', 382, 1, 30, 639538) But I must say this about our 3,000 workers.
('81', 382, 1, 31, 639583) If they do not abide by truth and non violence we shall sink.
('81', 382, 1, 32, 639645) Shri Bharatanandaji has formulated a graduated plan to provide for meeting the demand of khadi for the whole of India at the end of ten years.
('81', 382, 1, 33, 639788) Today the plan is a mere set of figures on paper.
('81', 382, 1, 34, 639838) But it can be turned into reality.
('81', 382, 1, 35, 639873) How is it possible, however, if we do not find good workers?
('81', 382, 1, 36, 639934) If we but make up our minds we can become really good workers.
('81', 382, 1, 37, 639997) Jajuji is right in giving this matter the first place.
('81', 382, 1, 38, 640052) The question before us is: How can we produce such workers? If we are always awake we shall develop the spirit of non violence and self sacrifice.
('81', 382, 1, 39, 640199) Even a votary of violence is capable of self sacrifice.
('81', 382, 1, 40, 640255) Hitler too is said to be self sacrificing.
('81', 382, 1, 41, 640298) He is violence incarnate.
('81', 382, 1, 42, 640324) It is said he is a vegetarian.
('81', 382, 1, 43, 640355) I find it difficult to imagine
('81', 383, 0, 1, 640386) 384 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 383, 1, 2, 640428) how, if he is one, he is able to countenance so much slaughter.
('81', 383, 1, 3, 640492) Anyway, his is said to be a life of self sacrifice.
('81', 383, 1, 4, 640544) He has no vices.
('81', 383, 1, 5, 640561) He has not married.
('81', 383, 1, 6, 640581) His character is said to be clean.
('81', 383, 1, 7, 640616) He is always alert.
('81', 383, 1, 8, 640636) What we require is both self sacrifice and non violence.
('81', 383, 1, 9, 640693) Non violence means love.
('81', 383, 1, 10, 640718) First the chief workers should manifest it.
('81', 383, 1, 11, 640762) We may begin with myself, then Jajuji and then the members of the Council.
('81', 383, 1, 12, 640837) Let us be vigilant and alert.
('81', 383, 1, 13, 640867) Our example is bound to influence the workers, even if unconsciously.
('81', 383, 1, 14, 640937) Then we shall be able to make ourselves free of doubts and fears about khadi.
('81', 383, 1, 15, 641015) It does not matter if our speed is slow.
('81', 383, 1, 16, 641056) We must never renounce the principles we have evolved.
('81', 383, 1, 17, 641111) If we do not forsake them, we are bound to be successful.
('81', 383, 2, 18, 641169) The question of a living wage is a difficult one.
('81', 383, 2, 19, 641219) 2 I myself have not been able to form any opinion on it.
('81', 383, 2, 20, 641276) If I come across a man who is good and qualified I should be tempted.
('81', 383, 2, 21, 641346) I shouldnt want to lose him.
('81', 383, 2, 22, 641375) If we frame a certain rule then we must follow that rule.
('81', 383, 2, 23, 641433) I have been trying to frame some rule.
('81', 383, 2, 24, 641472) But we must confess that at the moment we are helpless.
('81', 383, 2, 25, 641528) We cannot frame a rule which will make it difficult for us to find workers.
('81', 383, 2, 26, 641604) To make such a rule would mean that we do not move with the times.
('81', 383, 2, 27, 641671) We shall thereby even lose the ability to pay a wage of three annas to each spinner.
('81', 383, 2, 28, 641756) It is true and just that if we pay spinners three annas we should ourselves learn to live on three annas.
('81', 383, 2, 29, 641862) Today we are taking many times more than what the spinners get.
('81', 383, 2, 30, 641926) Even the lowest paid worker amongst us receives many times more.
('81', 383, 2, 31, 641991) But I must confess with shame that this disparity has put us in difficulties.
('81', 383, 2, 32, 642069) However, I have no satisfactory solution.

('81', 384, 4, 7, 642922) BARDOLI, December 19, 1941 As the war approaches the Indian border, people begin to get scared.
('81', 384, 4, 8, 643018) I have a typical letter from Assam and others from various parts.
('81', 384, 4, 9, 643084) They expect guidance from me as a war resister and director of satyagraha.
('81', 384, 4, 10, 643159) So far as satyagraha is concerned, in areas such as Assam responsible Congressmen should not offer satyagraha but should devote themselves to steadying those who are under Congress influence.
('81', 384, 4, 11, 643351) As to the guidance of those who would listen to the Congress or me, the people will presently have directions from the Working Committee.
('81', 384, 4, 12, 643489) But so far as I am concerned, I am quite clear that the people should refuse to be scared even though bombs may be dropped in their midst.
('81', 384, 4, 13, 643628) For the time being at any rate the danger is to be expected only in the big cities.
('81', 384, 4, 14, 643712) Those who do not wish to run any risk would do well quietly to leave their cities.
('81', 384, 4, 15, 643795) It is wrong to make a rush on every scare and crowd the railway stations.
('81', 384, 4, 16, 643869) The railway staff cannot possibly cope with sudden rushes.
('81', 384, 4, 17, 643928) It is unmanly to rush for saving oneself.
('81', 384, 4, 18, 643970) A wise and brave man will wait till the last man is safely out.
('81', 384, 4, 19, 644034) What I have said applies to all Con gressmen and others.
('81', 384, 4, 20, 644091) I would not like it to be said of us as a nation that we run about like mad men on the approach of the slightest danger.
('81', 384, 4, 21, 644212) We must face bravely any situation that may befall us.
('81', 384, 4, 22, 644267) Congressmen who are war resisters will remain at their posts and offer such assistance to the people as is within their power.
('81', 384, 4, 23, 644394) They will run, at any risk, to the help of those who may be injured.
('81', 384, 4, 24, 644463) Whilst I have been and am still against Congressmen joining A.R.P., I have never thought or suggested that Congressmen should leave points of danger or fields of service.

('81', 386, 2, 3, 646069) BARDOLI, December 20, 1941 I have been asked for a brief statement on the entry of America in the war.
('81', 386, 2, 4, 646172) It is not possible for me to join the chorus of current opinion.
('81', 386, 2, 5, 646237) I cannot welcome this entry of America.
('81', 386, 2, 6, 646277) American tradition singles her out as an arbitrator and mediator between the warring nations.
('81', 386, 2, 7, 646371) By her territorial vastness, amazing energy, unrivalled finan cial status and owing to the composite character of her people she is the one country which could have saved the world from the unthinkable butchery that is going on.
('81', 386, 2, 8, 646600) I do not know whether America could have avoided the entry.
('81', 386, 2, 9, 646660) I have no data for giving a decisive opinion on the question.
('81', 386, 2, 10, 646722) I have only expressed my fervent wish that it might have been possible for her to play her natural part.
('81', 386, 2, 11, 646827) It is tragic to contemplate that with America as party to the war there is no great Power left which can mediate and bring about peace for which I have no doubt the peoples of all lands are thirsting.
('81', 386, 2, 12, 647028) It is a strange phenomenon that the human wish is paralysed by the creeping effect of the war fever.

('81', 387, 3, 15, 648170) They should take him and inform him, and invite him to attend when a meeting is called.

('81', 387, 6, 20, 648454) You can introduce this change immediately.
('81', 387, 6, 21, 648497) The telephone cabin should be located outside the office, so that the telephone would be accessible even when the office is closed and the cabin should be so fitted that the receiver could be picked up from inside the office and the telephone used whenever necessary.
('81', 387, 6, 22, 648765) If it can be shifted outside the dak room, there would be sufficient accommo dation.

('81', 388, 3, 5, 649323) We will certainly spend as much as possible in Kangra as also in Pilani.
('81', 388, 3, 6, 649396) I think it would be best to call a meeting of the A. I. C. C. in Wardha.
('81', 388, 3, 7, 649469) If you agree, send invitations by wire.
('81', 388, 3, 8, 649509) The meeting should start on the day after my arrival and be over before the 19th.

('81', 389, 6, 12, 650878) My worry is this : You do not carry on your work as a physician in the way I would like you to do.
('81', 389, 6, 13, 650977) There are so many sick persons in the Ashram.
('81', 389, 6, 14, 651023) Why do you not treat them?
('81', 389, 6, 15, 651050) If a man or a woman falls ill I cannot send you to attend to the patient.
('81', 389, 6, 16, 651124) So far as I know you do nothing at Khurja, either.
('81', 389, 6, 17, 651175) You have given me to understand that you can do nothing until the house is ready.
('81', 389, 6, 18, 651257) Where there are houses already you will not work.
('81', 389, 6, 19, 651307) Do you follow what I Mean?
('81', 389, 6, 20, 651334) I have a moral responsibility towards you.
('81', 389, 6, 21, 651377) It irks me that I cannot give a satisfactory account to people about you.
('81', 389, 6, 22, 651451) Patients come to me.
('81', 389, 6, 23, 651472) Why should I have to call a doctor rather than you?
('81', 389, 6, 24, 651524) Your letter which is before me gives me no satisfaction.

('81', 389, 9, 30, 651763) JAMNALAL, How foolish and selfish I am !
('81', 389, 9, 31, 651804) I had no consideration for your health, and thought only of myself.
('81', 389, 9, 32, 651872) I sought your permission but did not wait for it, and insisted on the Committee holding the meeting at Wardha.
('81', 389, 9, 33, 651983) 1 In this I committed violence and that too not of an ordinary kind.
('81', 389, 9, 34, 652052) I misused our friendship, your generosity.
('81', 389, 9, 35, 652095) To beg pardon of you is no atonement.

('81', 390, 3, 9, 652661) 651. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS BARDOLI, December 27, 1941 The action of the Bihar Government in banning the meeting of the Hindu Mahasabha has always appeared to me to be inexplicable.
('81', 390, 3, 10, 652843) 2 Those who had proclaimed their desire to hold the meeting were responsible men and, what is more, so far as I am aware, trusted by the Central Government and known to be pro Government.
('81', 390, 3, 11, 653031) They had and have identified themselves with the war effort.
('81', 390, 3, 12, 653092) Why such people could not be trusted by the Bihar Provincial Government to behave decently passes my comprehension.
('81', 390, 3, 13, 653208) I see that Vir Savarkar 3 had accommodated the Bihar authorities to the extent of postponing the session with a view to coming to an understanding.
('81', 390, 3, 14, 653356) When all attempts at a settlement failed, civil resistance was the only remedy open to the suppressed Hindu Mahasabha.
('81', 390, 3, 15, 653475) And I must confess it fills me with delight to find Vir Savarkar, Dr. Moonje and other leaders being arrested 4 in their attempt to assert the very primary and very fundamental right of holding an orderly meeting subject to all reasonable restrictions about the preservation of the public peace.
('81', 390, 3, 16, 653771) I observe that even Dr. Shyama
('81', 390, 4, 17, 653802) Prasad, the new Finance Minister of the Bengal Government, has successfully courted arrest by committing the same honourable offence that his colleagues have committed.
('81', 390, 4, 18, 653971) I congratulate the leaders of the Sabha on their dignified and peaceful protest against the utterly arbitrary action of the Bihar Government.
('81', 390, 4, 19, 654113) There is surely something
('81', 390, 5, 20, 654139) 1 The addressee had expressed his inability to make arrangements for the A.I.C.C. meeting at Wardha.
('81', 390, 5, 21, 654240) 2 The Bihar Government had banned the annual session of the Hindu Mahasabha from being held between December 1, 1941 and January 10, 1942, so as to avoid the possibility of communal clashes at the time of Bakr id.

('81', 391, 1, 2, 654568) terribly wrong in it.
('81', 391, 1, 3, 654590) But out of evil somehow or other good often results.
('81', 391, 1, 4, 654643) Let me hope that this action of the Bihar Government has brought the Hindus and Muslims of Bihar, and even all India, together on the common platform of human liberty.
('81', 391, 1, 5, 654811) For I am quite sure that the Muslim League could not possibly wish the denial to their sister organization of a liberty which they could claim for themselves.
('81', 391, 1, 6, 654970) I hope that there will be only one end to this Bihar episode, viz., lifting of the ban on the Hindu Mahasabha and the men who are imprisoned today holding their session without let or hindrance.

('81', 394, 4, 6, 659135) MY DEAR C.R., I have studied the resolution 2 sent by you.
('81', 394, 4, 7, 659194) Maulana Saheb came in and just introduced it to me.
('81', 394, 4, 8, 659246) I am sorry I do not like it.
('81', 394, 4, 9, 659275) It evades the main issue and does not give the true lead to the nation.
('81', 394, 4, 10, 659347) I am quite clear that the difference between the Committee and me should be brought out and dealt with.
('81', 394, 4, 11, 659451) If we do not want to help this Government on other grounds than those of non violence, they ought to be clearly stated.
('81', 394, 4, 12, 659571) If we can under certain circumstances they should be defined.
('81', 394, 4, 13, 659633) The scope of Congress non violence should also be defined.

('81', 395, 2, 3, 660174) [On or before December 30, 1940] 2
('81', 395, 3, 4, 660209) So far as I am concerned, even if I was given the utmost power conceivable, even if I was made the Viceroy of India today, would I ask the people of India to take up the sword to keep the Empire alive?
('81', 395, 3, 5, 660411) I for one should feel that I was committing moral suicide in that I would be abandoning the faith of a lifetime, the faith which I had persuaded the Congress to accept for twenty years as a policy.
('81', 395, 3, 6, 660609) The steady unflinching pursuit of that policy has brought us quite close to the achievement of the objective.
('81', 395, 3, 7, 660719) Am I to abandon the very boat which has brought me quite close to the shore?
('81', 395, 3, 8, 660796) Yudhishthira 3 would not forsake his faithful dog and enter the gates of Heaven without him.
('81', 395, 3, 9, 660889) For he knew that the Kingdom of Heaven would be as naught to him without the dog, i.e., his faith.
('81', 395, 3, 10, 660988) Would the Arab (i.e., the Congress) give up towards the end of the journey the faithful steed (i.e., non violence) that had made it possible for [him] 4 to make that journey?
('81', 395, 3, 11, 661163) It would be an act of betrayal or faithlessness on my part.
('81', 395, 3, 12, 661223) Could I, when the war is at my door and when I am in the same predicament as they, forget the sovereign remedy I suggested to them 5 and clutch at the
('81', 395, 4, 13, 661374) 1 In his article The Month in BardoliI from which this discussion is reproduced, Mahadev Desai gives the following introduction : Though the actual decision [of the Working Committee] came to be made on the basis of the interpretation of the Bombay Resolution, what was of vital importance was the actual feeling in the minds of men.
('81', 395, 4, 14, 661708) No matter how the Bombay Resolution was interpreted, were we clear about certain fundamentals?
('81', 395, 4, 15, 661803) Were we clear that the policy of non violence that we had followed, to the best of our ability, for twenty years was no religious creed or for no religious purpose, but a wholly political method for the achievement of the political independence of India?
('81', 395, 4, 16, 662058) Gandhiji had no doubt on the question.
('81', 395, 4, 17, 662097) The next question wascould we at this critical hour in our nations history give up that policy even for the sake of proffered freedom? 2 The Congress Working Committee meeting concluded on December 30, 1941. 3 Eldest of the Pandavas, also known as Dharmaraja for his adherence to truth 4 The source has it.
('81', 395, 4, 18, 662404) 5 Gandhiji had advised the same course to the Abyssinians (Message on Italo Abyssinian Crisis, on or before 1 8 1935 and Statement on Italo Abyssinian Crisis, on or before 1 8 1935), the Chinese, the Gzechs, the Spaniards Discussion with Hengchih Tao, before 15 8 1938; If I were a Czech, 6 10 1938 and Letter to Juan Negrin, 15 10 1938), and the Poles (Message to the Poles, before 30 8 1939 and Cable to Paderewski, 8 9 1939).

('81', 396, 1, 2, 662880) method I have denounced and discarded?
('81', 396, 1, 3, 662919) No matter what the country would say, what should be the attitude of individual Congressmen who had sworn by the method of non violence?
('81', 396, 2, 4, 663056) He was clear that, if it was felt that we had committed a mistake, that it was worth while bargaining a principle for what seemed to be a richer gain, they should declare their conviction, and if and when the objective was gained, they should convert the whole of India into a recruiting ground, ask every man and woman to contribute his or her share in the war effort, and even extinguish themselves in so doing.
('81', 396, 2, 5, 663470) What was needed was downright honesty.
('81', 396, 2, 6, 663509) He at any rate had never conceived this possibility.
('81', 396, 2, 7, 663562) If he knew that some day India would have to engage in a violent war in order to win independence, he would long ago have addressed every youth to go in for military discipline, and he would not have placed tireless emphasis, day in and day out, on the various items of the constructive programme.

('81', 396, 4, 10, 663910) BARDOLI, December 30, 1941
('81', 396, 5, 11, 663937) DEAR MAULANA SAHIB, In the course of discussion in the Working Committee, I discov ered that I had committed a grave error in the interpretation of the Bombay Resolution.
('81', 396, 5, 12, 664108) I had interpreted it to mean that the Congress was to refuse participation in the present or all wars on the ground principally of non violence.
('81', 396, 5, 13, 664253) I found to my astonishment that most members differed from my interpretation and held that the opposition need not be on the ground of non violence.
('81', 396, 5, 14, 664402) On rereading the Bombay Resolution I found that the differing members were right and that I had read into it a meaning which its letter could not bear.
('81', 396, 5, 15, 664554) The discovery of the error makes it impossible for me to lead the Congress in the struggle for resistance to war effort on grounds in which non violence was not indispensable.
('81', 396, 5, 16, 664730) I could not, for instance, identify myself with opposition to war effort on the ground of ill will against Great Britain.
('81', 396, 5, 17, 664852) The resolution contemplated material association with Britain in the war effort as a price for guaranteed independence of India.
('81', 396, 5, 18, 664981) If such was my view, and I believed in the use of violence for gaining independence and yet refused participation in the effort as the price of that independence, I would consider myself guilty of unpatriotic conduct.
('81', 396, 5, 19, 665199) It is my certain belief that only non violence can save India and the world from self extinction.
('81', 396, 5, 20, 665297) Such being the case, I must continue my mission whether I am alone or assisted by an organization or individuals.
('81', 396, 5, 21, 665411) You will, therefore, please relieve me of the responsibility laid upon me by the Bombay Resolution.

('81', 397, 4, 8, 666076) 662. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS
('81', 397, 5, 9, 666104) BARDOLI, December 30, 1941 If anyone had thought, as I had thought, that the door to Congress participation in the present war on the ground of Congress non violence was closed for ever by the Bombay Resolution, then they may now know that the Bombay Resolution had not quite closed the door.
('81', 397, 5, 10, 666397) Undoubtedly, as the resolution said, the Poona resolution had lapsed, therefore, the Poona offer had lapsed.
('81', 397, 5, 11, 666506) But the Congress has now, through the Working Committee, made it clear that the door is not barred altogether against Congress participation, certainly not on the ground of non violence.
('81', 397, 5, 12, 666693) The key for unlocking the door remains principally in the hands of the British Government.
('81', 397, 5, 13, 666784) The Working Committtee has very properly declined to state the terms on which that door can be opened.
('81', 397, 5, 14, 666887) It will depend upon varying circumstances, but, in my opinion, the chief circumstance is the Government.
('81', 397, 5, 15, 666992) Having been insulted often enough, the Working Committee would not court any further insult by making any offer.
('81', 397, 5, 16, 667105) After all, its position is absolutely clear.
('81', 397, 5, 17, 667150) Everbody knows what the Congress stands for and what it wants.
('81', 397, 5, 18, 667213) Everyone should, therefore, know that nothing will be accepted by the Congress short of what it stands for.
('81', 397, 5, 19, 667321) Therefore, the burden of the next step is cast on the Government.
('81', 397, 5, 20, 667387) This is the chief thing that is relevant at the present time.
('81', 397, 5, 21, 667449) I have a pressing cable from those English friends who are interested in Indias freedom and who are lovers of their own people.
('81', 397, 6, 22, 667577) 1 For the Congress Working Committees resolution in response to this, vide Appendix Congres Working Committees Resolution, 30 12 1941.
('81', 398, 0, 1, 667712) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 399
('81', 398, 1, 2, 667759) I have not replied to that cable.
('81', 398, 1, 3, 667793) They have reminded me of Mr. Andrews legacy.
('81', 398, 1, 4, 667838) Whatever the meaning of their reminder, my mean ing could only be one.
('81', 398, 1, 5, 667909) The one indissoluble bond between Charlie Andrews and myself was that we would never compromise our cons cience on any account whatsoever.
('81', 398, 1, 6, 668048) And, in all that I have done, I can fearlessly claim that I have been guided by my conscience.
('81', 398, 1, 7, 668143) I have made it clear in my letter 1 to the Maulana Sahib that I could not possibly identify myself with the door to participation being kept open in any shape or form, because that would mean, in my opinion, a recantation of all that the Congress has stood for the last twenty years or more.
('81', 398, 1, 8, 668435) I would not be guilty of selling that heritage even for the independence of India because it would not be real independence.
('81', 398, 1, 9, 668560) I feel that if any country has a message for the world, which is groaning under violence unknown perhaps to history, it is India.
('81', 398, 1, 10, 668690) When India, through the Indian National Congress, accepted the policy of non violence, so far as I know, no Congressman had thought that another warand such a bloody warwas to come so soon as it has.
('81', 398, 1, 11, 668890) The testing time, however, has come for India and I, who have an unchangeable belief in the efficacy of non violence for the present distemper from which mankind is suffering, could not possibly in any manner, directly or indirectly, associate myself with participation in the war; and so I have stood out.
('81', 398, 1, 12, 669197) But the Congress contains men and women holding varying shades of opinion and, therefore, it should be no wonder that the Working Committee represents those varying shades of opinion.
('81', 398, 1, 13, 669381) It has at least three bodies or, rather, it has at least three bodies representing three schools of thought: a minority party, believing in non partici pation on the ground of non violence, pure and simple; the other believing that the Congress should not carry non violence to the point of refusing association in the war under any circumstances and there is the third, which has many reasons almost as strong as the decisive reason of non violence guiding the minority.
('81', 398, 1, 14, 669853) The resolution 2 which has been just handed by the Secretary of the Working Committee to the Press is a resultant of the efforts of these bodies.
('81', 398, 1, 15, 669999) I would like the public and Congressmen to read that resolution in that light.
('81', 398, 1, 16, 670078) I hope everybody will appreciate the fact that the Working Committee has not come to any hasty decision.
('81', 398, 1, 17, 670183) It did not mind what time it took in order

('81', 399, 1, 2, 670362) to produce a resolution worthy of the great national organization that it represents.
('81', 399, 1, 3, 670448) I would say one thing to Congressmen that those who are believers in non violence in the same sense that I am, have nothing to fear, as I interpret the resolution of the Working Committee.
('81', 399, 1, 4, 670637) It not only leaves them absolutely free to hold that opinion but to propagate it for the acceptance of anybody who chooses.
('81', 399, 1, 5, 670761) Only they remain in the Congress so long as the Congress is not called upon to participate in the war effort.
('81', 399, 1, 6, 670871) It is open to them to convert all Congressmen to their view.
('81', 399, 1, 7, 670932) I am quite sure that the Working Committee will welcome such a conversion but I would warn Congressmen against indecision at this critical period in the national life and I would warn them also against weakly following this party or that for the sake of gaining power in the Congress.
('81', 399, 1, 8, 671217) Those who do so will miserably fail to gain power for the nation.
('81', 399, 1, 9, 671283) Personally, I would like the Congress, as I would like the whole world, to accept non violence as the law of life in every department, social, political and domestic.
('81', 399, 1, 10, 671450) But there is no room for cowardliness.
('81', 399, 1, 11, 671489) I would far rather that we all became violent than cowards.
('81', 399, 1, 12, 671549) Let me hope, therefore, that every Congressman will have his own convictions and the courage to enforce them.

('81', 405, 1, 2, 678888) 677. SPEECH AT GUJARAT PROVINCIAL CONGRESS COMMITTEE MEETING 1
('81', 405, 2, 3, 678951) BARDOLI, January 4, 1942
('81', 405, 3, 4, 678976) [Gandhiji] first asked everyone if he had understood all the implications of the
('81', 405, 4, 5, 679057) Bardoli Resolution.
('81', 405, 5, 6, 679077) Then let me put it to you in a nutshell.
('81', 405, 5, 7, 679118) The resolution means that, if the Government gave a guarantee that full freedom would be given after the war, the Congress would help in keeping this Empire alive.
('81', 405, 5, 8, 679282) It was not that the bargain had been actually made, but the terms had been agreed upon, whereas, if I did not want to enter into any bargain at all, I should plainly say so.
('81', 405, 5, 9, 679456) If you feel that on your agreeing to offer full co operation in the war effort, India will have complete independence after the war, that the British will thereafter remain in India at your mercy and sufferance, that even during the war you will run your own affairs provided of course that your Defence Minister will carry on the war to victory, you must confirm the Bardoli Resolution.
('81', 405, 5, 10, 679844) The temptation is very great indeed.
('81', 405, 5, 11, 679881) If for that sake you are ready to reverse the Congress policy and purchase swaraj and pay as price thereof ahimsa, you must confirm the resolution.
('81', 405, 5, 12, 680029) Remember that the very greatest of our leaders are party to the resolution and they have not chosen to do so lightly.
('81', 405, 5, 13, 680147) As against this there are those who think that ahimsa is a pearl of great price and that it cannot be given up, that it can never be the price of swaraj, then their position is different.
('81', 405, 5, 14, 680335) But if you are in doubt, if you feel that in sticking to ahimsa you lose both ahimsa, because you are incapable of it, and swaraj, that Gandhi is a good man but it would be prudent not to go the whole length with him, then you must accept the resolution.
('81', 405, 5, 15, 680590) Only those will express their disapproval of it who are sure in their heart of hearts that prudence, political insight, policy, every conside ration demands that ahimsa may not be sacrificed for swaraj.
('81', 405, 5, 16, 680793) Now let those who will vote for the Bardoli Resolution raise their hands.
('81', 405, 6, 17, 680867) 1 Reproduced from Mahadev Desais The Month in BardoliI 2 In reply several people did not raise their hands.
('81', 405, 6, 18, 680975) For the Resolution, vide Appendix Congress Woring Committee Resolution, 30 12 1941. 3 Thirty six raised their hands.

('81', 406, 1, 2, 681140) Now let the acharyas (masters) of ahimsa raise their hands.
('81', 406, 2, 3, 681200) There were about ten neutrals who wanted to put questions, but Gandhiji said as the vote was quite informal the neutrals need not trouble themselves.
('81', 406, 3, 4, 681350) Mahatma Gandhi stated that he had not left the Congress, and his position was the same even at Bombay.
('81', 406, 3, 5, 681453) He said : I am a servant of the Congress and I want to serve the Congress in consonance with the principles of truth and non violence.
('81', 406, 3, 6, 681588) The Working Committee has decided to co operate with the Government in war if Britain grants swaraj to India.
('81', 406, 3, 7, 681698) Whatever be my opinion, you must exercise our free judgement in this matter.
('81', 406, 3, 8, 681775) It is not a fact that the Congress has violated the principle of non violence but it has only made a small opening for violence just with a view to shaking hands with Britain.
('81', 406, 3, 9, 681951) Rajaji thinks that all of us should go to war fully armed, but it may not be the opinion of all.
('81', 406, 3, 10, 682048) We should continue the constructive programme.
('81', 406, 3, 11, 682095) Of course it will be now very much restricted.
('81', 406, 3, 12, 682142) I do not want to send workers to jail nowadays when their services can be better availed of in alleviating panic.

('81', 408, 5, 9, 684370) BARDOLI, January 7, 1942 As far as may be, I have been endeavouring to study the internal and external reaction to the Working Committee resolution.
('81', 408, 5, 10, 684519) 2 My being relieved of the direction of Congress civil disobedience does not reduce my responsibility but increases it manifold.
('81', 408, 5, 11, 684648) For one thing, my official disconnection with the Congress itself increases my detach ment; but since detachment never means indifference, my attachment to every Congressman increases and I must speak to him more than before.
('81', 408, 5, 12, 684874) The voice of silence was enough to direct the campaign of civil disobedience, but it is not enough to explain and interpret in terms of non violence the day to day puzzles that arise in the minds of Congressmen and others by reason of the overwhelming events happening near us.
('81', 408, 5, 13, 685152) Rangoon was naturally and culturally part of us before Burma years ago became part of British India and, therefore, it remains part of us though now sundered.
('81', 408, 5, 14, 685311) What has happened there, 3 has had its repercussions all over India.
('81', 408, 5, 15, 685380) So far as I can see, civil disobedience in the sense in which it was launched is not likely to be revived on behalf of the Congress till the war has ended.
('81', 408, 5, 16, 685536) In a purely symbolic manner it may have to be kept up not in the name of the Congress but on behalf of resisters of all war on the pure ground of non violence, no matter how few they are.
('81', 408, 5, 17, 685724) It will be kept up for the sake of asserting the right of resisters to carry on propaganda against all war.
('81', 408, 5, 18, 685832) They dare not keep still in the midst of

('81', 409, 1, 3, 686221) They must not only speak and write against it, they must, if need be, sacrifice themselves in the attempt to stop the torrent of blood.
('81', 409, 1, 4, 686357) Whether they are a few or many they have to live their mission.
('81', 409, 1, 5, 686421) Before taking any step in the direction of civil disobedience I propose to restart the three weeklies 1 and understand the reaction of Government to the new orientation.
('81', 409, 1, 6, 686591) I hope that they will have no objection to propaganda, naturally non violent, against all war.
('81', 409, 1, 7, 686686) It would be non embarrassing in the sense that there cannot be, as there never was, any idea of surrounding or picketing munition factories or recruiting offices.
('81', 409, 1, 8, 686849) If the right is not conceded, there must be token civil disobe dience by the fewest possible, even one or two known believers in resistance to all war.
('81', 409, 1, 9, 687001) I must not select many, because every worker is wanted to educate the people in the art of non violent behaviour in the face of impending danger.
('81', 409, 1, 10, 687147) Strange as it may appear, I suggest that ceaseless occupation in constructive programme is the best preparation to face danger.
('81', 409, 1, 11, 687275) For it means concentration in villages of the city people and their being occupied and occupying the villagers in productive and educative work.
('81', 409, 1, 12, 687420) This removes unemployment and with it fear.
('81', 409, 1, 13, 687464) Such movement on a large scale at once inaugurates a new social order.

('81', 411, 4, 7, 689743) 687. SPEECH AT KHADI VIDYALAYA 1
('81', 411, 5, 8, 689776) BARDOLI, January 8, 1942 Needless to say that it gives me pleasure to declare this Khadi Vidyalaya open.
('81', 411, 5, 9, 689881) There should be many such vidyalayas in Gujarat.
('81', 411, 5, 10, 689930) As a matter of fact Khadi Vidyalaya may be said to have been opened when in 1921 we decided to prepare for launching satyagraha.
('81', 411, 5, 11, 690059) I had not then discovered the word vidyalaya 2 and had at any rate not associated it with khadi, though I knew that khadi was a vidya (science), and most important of sciences.
('81', 411, 5, 12, 690236) But I had then not the courage to say it.
('81', 411, 5, 13, 690278) But the beginning was made here, anything that was invented in the line took the name of Bardolias for instance, the Bardoli pinjan (carding bow.) Then we had a big depot here for the manufacture of all our implements.
('81', 411, 5, 14, 690497) This depot has, for several reasons, been moved to Sabarmati.
('81', 411, 5, 15, 690559) Whilst, therefore, it is a pleasure to me to open the Vidyalaya, it is a matter of sorrow that we should be opening it at this late day.
('81', 411, 5, 16, 690696) It needs no argument today to prove that the charkha is linked with ahimsa and therefore with swaraj.
('81', 411, 5, 17, 690798) What is going to be the part that crores of our people will play during the deadly carnage that is going on?
('81', 411, 5, 18, 690907) We know the part that Government are playing, we know the part that some of us are playing at their behest, and to satisfy the pangs of hunger and starvation.
('81', 411, 5, 19, 691066) They are rushing headlong to take part in the work of destruction.
('81', 411, 5, 20, 691133) Millions are being collected from the rich and the poor, and yet the Government coffers are ever empty.
('81', 411, 5, 21, 691237) But barring those that are thus directly and indirectly helping in the work of destruction, what are the rest going to do, what can they do?
('81', 411, 5, 22, 691378) How are they to carry on?
('81', 411, 5, 23, 691404) There is starvation and poverty everywhere.
('81', 411, 5, 24, 691448) There is scarcity of water, and unlike in South Africa where there is

('81', 412, 1, 2, 691716) every provision against droughts, there is none here, and we and our cattle die like flies for want of water.
('81', 412, 1, 3, 691826) Those that go to war do so in the hope of returning alive after killing others, some may not return at all.
('81', 412, 1, 4, 691934) But shall we be content to die like flies?
('81', 412, 1, 5, 691977) We have sworn by ahimsa and pledged ourselves to win swaraj by ahimsa.
('81', 412, 1, 6, 692048) It is twenty years since we took the pledge, yet we do not know how to redeem it.
('81', 412, 1, 7, 692130) What then is the thing that will enable us to work for swaraj, and to stand erect and strong in the face of this conflagration?
('81', 412, 1, 8, 692258) It is the charkha and all it means.
('81', 412, 1, 9, 692294) Land we have, but the land system, uneconomic holdings and methods, have reduced us to the level of beasts of burden, it does not yield us enough to eat all the year round, and we are workless for almost half the year.
('81', 412, 1, 10, 692513) We have, therefore, to take up subsidiary indus tries.
('81', 412, 1, 11, 692568) Those are the charkha and the allied activities.
('81', 412, 1, 12, 692617) I do not want to repeat the argument or go into the implications of the science of khadi.
('81', 412, 1, 13, 692707) It is a good thing that this vidyalaya is being opened.
('81', 412, 1, 14, 692763) Let this Vidyalaya generate a force that may universalize the charkha in Gujarat.
('81', 412, 1, 15, 692845) There are, I am told, seventy thousand Congress members in Ahmedabad.
('81', 412, 1, 16, 692915) If all these were regular spinners, did they give their quota of yarn to the Congress?
('81', 412, 1, 17, 693002) Congress soldiers should not forget that their chief weapon is the charkha and spinning regularly is their military discipline.
('81', 412, 1, 18, 693130) The military weapons and munitions today have proved futile.
('81', 412, 1, 19, 693191) They have failed to keep Czechoslovakia, Poland and France free or alive, though they boasted of renowned soldiers.
('81', 412, 1, 20, 693307) Hitler has enslaved them all.
('81', 412, 1, 21, 693337) Besides, we can no more guarantee the welfare of a country that engages in armed warfare.
('81', 412, 1, 22, 693427) President Roose velt says he and the Allied Powers are fighting the Axis Powers to make the nations of the world free, and that the Axis Powers are fighting to enslave the world.
('81', 412, 1, 23, 693606) But to me both the parties seem to be tarred with the same brush.
('81', 412, 1, 24, 693672) What shall we do in the midst of this mutual destruction which spells freedom for none?
('81', 412, 1, 25, 693760) The charkha and all it means is the only thing that will enable us to live and make us stand in honour and self respect .
('81', 412, 1, 26, 693882) This we can do if we can combine faith with understanding, for un understanding faith will not carry us far.
('81', 412, 1, 27, 693991) The work has been placed into Uttamchands hands.
('81', 412, 1, 28, 694040) The responsibility has been entrus ted to him, not because he is an expert, but because he has the faith.
('81', 412, 1, 29, 694146) If he refuses other responsibilities and concentrates on this task, he is sure to bring credit to this venture, difficult as it is.
('81', 412, 1, 30, 694278) Dont think that you have come here just to learn the art of khadi.
('81', 412, 1, 31, 694345) If you labour under such a misunderstanding you will not be
('81', 413, 0, 1, 694405) 414 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 413, 1, 2, 694447) able to turn out any work anywhere.
('81', 413, 1, 3, 694483) You have come here to bear the burden of the work for swaraj.
('81', 413, 1, 4, 694545) It is a tremendous burden to bear, and the very first lesson you have to learn is to know the qualifications of the soldiers of swaraj.
('81', 413, 1, 5, 694681) The very first is restraint and patient labour.
('81', 413, 1, 6, 694729) That is what the charkha will teach you.
('81', 413, 1, 7, 694770) The renowned cities of the world are crumbling into dust.
('81', 413, 1, 8, 694828) London is changed out of recognition, the edifices which the builders thought would stand the revages of time are no more.
('81', 413, 1, 9, 694951) St. Pauls Cathedral, Westminster Abbey, Buckin gham Palace have all been bombed with the result that what is called the capital of the world today looks, to use Narmadashankars word, devastated.
('81', 413, 1, 10, 695146) And our cities like Rangoon will share the same fate.
('81', 413, 1, 11, 695200) The age of cities is thus coming to an end.
('81', 413, 1, 12, 695244) The slogan of Back to the villages was never so true as today.
('81', 413, 1, 13, 695307) Therefore all of you at any rate have to go to the villages.
('81', 413, 1, 14, 695368) The mills will not be of any avail.
('81', 413, 1, 15, 695404) They are producing cloth for the belligerents and may ere long cease even to do that work, and may have solely to engage in producing munition.
('81', 413, 1, 16, 695548) We have therefore to produce all our cloth and to make our villages self sufficient in all respects.
('81', 413, 1, 17, 695649) That you cannot do without a life of restraint and patient toil.
('81', 413, 1, 18, 695714) For this you will have to know all the processes right from identifying the different varieties of cotton to the stage when it becomes fit to be woven into khadi.
('81', 413, 1, 19, 695877) The course you have to prepare for is not simple.
('81', 413, 1, 20, 695927) It will require all your energies and your faculties, for it is an all comprehensive one.
('81', 413, 1, 21, 696017) What about girls?
('81', 413, 1, 22, 696035) Girls also may be admitted, but that depends upon Uttamchands courage.
('81', 413, 1, 23, 696106) We cannot admit them right now.
('81', 413, 1, 24, 696138) Every one of us, man or woman, has to lend his hands and his mind and his heart to the work of building our nation and swaraj.
('81', 413, 1, 25, 696265) [From Gujarati] Harijanbandhu, 18 1 1942 688. DISCUSSION WITH HARIJAN WORKERS 1
('81', 413, 2, 26, 696345) BARDOLI, January 8, 1942 2
('81', 413, 3, 27, 696372) The first was the question about the wells: Should we seek the co operation of Harijans, and, if so, to what extent?
('81', 413, 3, 28, 696489) Co operation is necessary, but we must not take the Harijans in a body and invade the savarna quarters.
('81', 413, 3, 29, 696593) We should visit the wells,
('81', 413, 4, 30, 696620) 1 This is reproduced from Mahadev Desais The Month in BardoliII.
('81', 413, 4, 31, 696685) Harijan workers who had met in Sabarmati under the Presidentship of Thakkar Bapa came to Gandhiji with ready framed questions.
('81', 413, 4, 32, 696812) 2 From Gandhi19151948 : A Detailed Chronology
('81', 414, 0, 1, 696858) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARTY, 1942 415
('81', 414, 1, 2, 696906) ascertain the classes of people using them, and reason with these to let the Harijans use them.
('81', 414, 1, 3, 697002) Regarding Local Board wells the help of offi cials may be freely sought, and such Harijans may be asked to go and use the wells as may be prepared to stand ill treatment.
('81', 414, 1, 4, 697173) But the brunt should be borne by the sevaks 1, care being taken to stand between the Harijans and those who would threaten to molest or belabour them.
('81', 414, 1, 5, 697324) The Harijans should be invariably asked to use clean vessels and observe all the ordinary rules of cleanliness.
('81', 414, 1, 6, 697436) We can also dig wells for Harijans and invite the savarnas to use them.
('81', 414, 1, 7, 697508) It is likely that the Harijans may be boycotted, we should see that they get employment elsewhere.
('81', 414, 1, 8, 697607) The Harijans have to be taught to learn to assert themselves firmly and non violently, and the savarnas may be gently reminded that injustice cannot last for ever.
('81', 414, 1, 9, 697771) These are broad principles, but everyone has to take measures suited to the circumstances in each case.
('81', 414, 2, 10, 697875) Q. Cant we insist on the admission of Harijan boys to hostels where all non Harijan Hindu boys are admitted?
('81', 414, 3, 11, 697984) A. Of course, but care should be taken to see that the hostel is not exclusively for a particular community or section of Hindus.
('81', 414, 3, 12, 698114) Where all sections are admitted and only the Harijans are excluded, the workers should strain every nerve to get the Harijans admitted.
('81', 414, 3, 13, 698250) When I said that removal of untouchability did not include the removal of restrictions on inter dining and intermarriage, I had the general Hindu public in mind, not the Congress workers or Congress men.
('81', 414, 3, 14, 698454) These have to abolish untouchability from every part of their life.
('81', 414, 4, 15, 698522) The next question was about the temptations given by missionaries in the shape of books, school fees, etc., with a view to the boys ultimate conversion.
('81', 414, 4, 16, 698675) How was one to deal with them?
('81', 414, 5, 17, 698706) [A.] The missionaries have of course the right to preach the gospel of Christ and to invite non Christians to embrace Christianity.
('81', 414, 5, 18, 698838) But every attempt to press material benefits or attractions in the aid of conversion should be freely exposed, and the Harijans should be edu cated to resist these temptations.
('81', 414, 6, 19, 699015) Q. What are the qualifications that a Harijan sevak should have in order to make his work felt?
('81', 414, 7, 20, 699111) A. Such a question is rather late in the day.
('81', 414, 7, 21, 699157) But I shall try to answer it again.
('81', 414, 7, 22, 699193) It is a misfortune that politics have been mixed up with anti untouchability work, which is essentially one of self 
('81', 414, 8, 23, 699310) 1 Workers
('81', 415, 0, 1, 699320) 416 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 415, 1, 2, 699362) purification, justice, humanity.
('81', 415, 1, 3, 699395) Long before I took to politics I felt that abolition of untouchability and Hindu Muslim unity were essential for national well being.
('81', 415, 1, 4, 699529) In order to prevent the vivisection of Hinduism I had to fight it with my life, and the question did receive a political complexion, but in essence it is a purely religious and moral question.
('81', 415, 1, 5, 699722) Every sevak must be fired with a passion to purify Hinduism, and must be ready to lay down his life in the attempt.
('81', 415, 1, 6, 699838) Such a sevak will be ready to sacrifice his allfamily connections, social advantages, and life itselfin order to wipe out the blot on Hinduism.
('81', 415, 1, 7, 699982) The work should be as one of lifes essential functions, e.g., offering ones prayers, ablutions, etc., not carrying emolument or reward.
('81', 415, 1, 8, 700118) If the worker is fired with this passion, the way will be clear before him.
('81', 415, 1, 9, 700194) Thus a worker would rather starve than allow the Harijans to be starved, would hesitate to use amenities which are denied to the Harijans and feel increasing identification with them every day.
('81', 415, 1, 10, 700388) All this work is to be done without regard to the political results.
('81', 415, 1, 11, 700457) Assum ing for a moment that swaraj does not come as a result of the abolition of untouchability, the work has to be done in order to keep Hinduism pure and alive.
('81', 415, 1, 12, 700620) I know that with some of the Congressmen the work has only a political meaning, but it is wrong.
('81', 415, 1, 13, 700717) If they seek justice from an alien Government, they must first do justice to their own kith and kin.
('81', 415, 1, 14, 700818) That is the fundamental maxim of equityhe who seeks equity must do equity.
('81', 415, 1, 15, 700893) There is, I know, a section who says that political freedom must be won first and social reform would follow later.
('81', 415, 1, 16, 701009) It is a wrong idea, and certainly inconsistent with one who would win swaraj by non violent means.
('81', 415, 1, 17, 701108) But the Harijan worker has to educate both the ortho dox and exclusively political minded people.
('81', 415, 1, 18, 701206) Let him not judge others, but by selfless self effacing service set an example to them.

('81', 415, 2, 20, 701343) BARDOLI, [On or before January 9, 1942] 2
('81', 415, 3, 21, 701385) [Q.] We are producing two lakhs of rupees worth of khadi, but the demand exceeds 12 lakhs.
('81', 415, 3, 22, 701476) How are we to meet it?
('81', 415, 3, 23, 701499) We have not enough weavers and workers, and there is the question of funds too.
('81', 415, 4, 24, 701579) [A.] Let me take up the last question first.
('81', 415, 4, 25, 701624) It is my firm conviction which has grown upon me with the years that, if there are

('81', 416, 1, 2, 701855) workers, no work suffers for want of funds.
('81', 416, 1, 3, 701899) But the real question is of the capacity to produce.
('81', 416, 1, 4, 701952) Supposing someone gave you one crore of rupees, I know you cannot produce ten crore rupees worth of khadi.
('81', 416, 1, 5, 702059) The reason is lack of workers, lack of efficiency, and lack of faith.
('81', 416, 1, 6, 702129) It is good that there is a growing demand for khadithough twelve lakhs of rupees worth of khadi is nothing extraordinary where eight crores of rupees worth of khadi could be used.
('81', 416, 1, 7, 702309) But the increased sales mean that the liking for khadi is also on the increase.
('81', 416, 1, 8, 702389) We should contact these consumers and persuade them to spin.
('81', 416, 1, 9, 702450) And here comes in the dhanush takli.
('81', 416, 1, 10, 702487) You may know that I can spin on the ordinary wheel better, but I have made a point of using only the dhanush takli, and I am now almost an expert in it.
('81', 416, 1, 11, 702640) The reason is that, whereas Lakshmidasbhai 1 cannot execute an order for 25 lakhs of wheels, the people can themselves make as many dhanush taklis.
('81', 416, 1, 12, 702788) It is so easy to make, so cheap, takes very little material and practically no technical skill.
('81', 416, 1, 13, 702884) It is a wrong policy to manufacture wheels in Sabarmati in order to export them to the Punjab or South India.
('81', 416, 1, 14, 702994) They should be made locally everywhere, and for that purpose the dhanush takli is the thing.
('81', 416, 1, 15, 703087) Universalization of this will increase production by leaps and bounds.
('81', 416, 1, 16, 703158) You have to catch the increasing love of spinning by the fore lock.
('81', 416, 1, 17, 703226) In none of our previous campaigns was spinning done on such a large scale as during the last campaign.
('81', 416, 1, 18, 703329) The figures for Sabarmati Jail were good, but the figures for Agra and Bareilly were also good.
('81', 416, 1, 19, 703425) Badshah Khan has been able to popularize spinning as he had never been before.
('81', 416, 1, 20, 703504) We have, therefore, to take this tide at the flood and bring expert knowledge to bear on the love for spinning that is grow ing.
('81', 416, 1, 21, 703633) We have to go from house to house and enlist willing spinners ready to contribute their yarn.
('81', 416, 1, 22, 703727) I take it that all khadi workers are believers in the attainment of swaraj by non violent means.
('81', 416, 1, 23, 703824) Yours then should be the largest contribution to constructive work.
('81', 416, 1, 24, 703892) Some of you have to be weavers too.
('81', 416, 1, 25, 703928) There are enough handloom weavers in India to produce all the cloth we need.
('81', 416, 1, 26, 704005) We have to persuade them to take to weaving hand spun yarn and also to get their womenfolk and children to produce yarn in their homes.

('81', 417, 1, 2, 704219) 690. NOTES
('81', 417, 2, 3, 704230) TO THE SUBSCRIBERS
('81', 417, 3, 4, 704249) The Manager tells me that the subscribers of Harijan have appreciated the unavoidable suspension and exercised extraordinary patience.
('81', 417, 3, 5, 704384) With a few understandable exceptions they have not recalled the balance of the unused subscription due to them.
('81', 417, 3, 6, 704496) I am glad to be able now to say that they will have their copy again regularly.
('81', 417, 3, 7, 704576) It will not be possible to retain the old rate for reasons they know.
('81', 417, 3, 8, 704646) The subscriptions left over will be credited to the subscribers who will be notified when they are to be exhausted.
('81', 417, 3, 9, 704762) I hope that the three editions will retain their old popularity.
('81', 417, 3, 10, 704827) I expect even visible increase, for I believe in the intrinsic value of the menu that will be served to the reader from week to week.
('81', 417, 3, 11, 704961) The three weeklies are purely and simply media of service.
('81', 417, 3, 12, 705020) Never have they been a business enterprise.
('81', 417, 3, 13, 705064) VIOLENCE IS DISASTROUS Shri S. V. Thakar, the quiet but efficient worker in the Harijan and other causes, sends me a note drawing attention to a violent feud between two parties of Bhils which his intervention with Government assistance has just prevented.
('81', 417, 3, 14, 705321) The late Gula Maharaj, himself a Bhil reformer, had by his earnestness and simplicity appealed to the Bhil imagination, and thousands of them inspired by him had abandoned drink and other evil habits.
('81', 417, 3, 15, 705522) He died a year ago leaving a successor.
('81', 417, 3, 16, 705562) There was a social boycott proclaimed by the reform party against those who would not give up bad habits.
('81', 417, 3, 17, 705668) This bred bad blood.
('81', 417, 3, 18, 705689) Violence seemed imminent.
('81', 417, 3, 19, 705715) Shri Thakars timely intervention referred to above stopped bloodshed.
('81', 417, 3, 20, 705785) But the reform has suffered a setback.
('81', 417, 3, 21, 705824) The party of opposition is in the ascendant, and unless the pure ethical spirit again pervades the movement it may collapse.
('81', 417, 3, 22, 705949) Shri Thakar rightly wishes to draw the moral that violence even in a good cause will not answer, and that every reform must be broadbased on the willing and enlightened association of the people concerned.
('81', 417, 3, 23, 706155) They cannot be coerced into good habits.
('81', 417, 3, 24, 706196) ADIVASIS Thakkar Bapa complains that, whilst he likes the pamphlet dealing with the constructive programme, he misses in it mention of Adivasis or the so called aboriginals, such as Santhals, Bhils, etc.
('81', 417, 4, 25, 706400) 1 A chapter on Adivasis was added in the revised edition of the Constructive Programme : Its Meaning and Place; vide Constructive Programme: Its Meaning and Place, 13 12 1941.
('81', 418, 0, 1, 706576) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARTY, 1942 419
('81', 418, 1, 2, 706624) complaint is just.
('81', 418, 1, 3, 706643) Many other causes are included in the constructive programme by implication.
('81', 418, 1, 4, 706720) But that cannot and should not satisfy such a humanitarian as Thakkar Bapa.
('81', 418, 1, 5, 706796) The Adivasis are the original inhabitants whose material position is perhaps no better than that of Harijans and who have long been victims of neglect on the part of the so called high classes.
('81', 418, 1, 6, 706990) The Adivasis should have found a special place in the constructive programme.
('81', 418, 1, 7, 707068) Non mention was an oversight.
('81', 418, 1, 8, 707098) They provide a vast field of service for Congressmen.
('81', 418, 1, 9, 707152) The Christian missio nary has been more or less in sole occupation of the field.
('81', 418, 1, 10, 707233) Great as his labour has been, it has not prospered as it might have, because of his ultimate aim being the Adivasis conversion to his fold and their becoming de Indianized.
('81', 418, 1, 11, 707406) Anyway, no one who hopes to construct swaraj on the foundation of non violence can afford to neglect even the least of Indias sons.
('81', 418, 1, 12, 707538) Adivasis are too numerous to be counted among the least.

('81', 418, 2, 15, 707866) Fortunately for India and humanity, the Congress is not such an organization.
('81', 418, 2, 16, 707944) No other purely national organization is or can be in the India of today.
('81', 418, 2, 17, 708018) Fortunately again for India and humanity, the Congress has pledged itself since 1920 to win Indias freedom through non violent means.
('81', 418, 2, 18, 708152) But up to now it has been largely a debating society, offering civil disobedience at intervals and all the time only playing with its vital programme of construction.
('81', 418, 2, 19, 708319) At one time every Congressman was expected to create something for the nation.
('81', 418, 2, 20, 708398) He or she was to spin for the nation.
('81', 418, 2, 21, 708436) Congressmen would not respond, and the clause about spinning was dropped.
('81', 418, 2, 22, 708510) There were other items too which every Congressman was to work.
('81', 418, 2, 23, 708574) But he has not done so to the extent expected.
('81', 418, 2, 24, 708621) The moment has now come for him to make a definite choice.
('81', 418, 2, 25, 708680) The only programme before him is to become a servant or soldier of peace.
('81', 418, 2, 26, 708754) A soldier of peace, unlike the one of the sword, has to give all his spare time to the promotion of peace alike in war time as in peace time.
('81', 418, 2, 27, 708896) His work in peace time is both a measure of prevention of, as also that of preparation for, war time.
('81', 418, 2, 28, 708998) If then I was a Congressman with a vote, I would vote, as an emergency measure, for requiring every Congressman now on the
('81', 419, 0, 1, 709121) 420 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 419, 1, 2, 709163) Congress register or to come hereafter to possess the minimum qualifications for working the constructive programme.
('81', 419, 1, 3, 709280) It would be wrong to remind me that the Congress should retain its democratic character.
('81', 419, 1, 4, 709369) It will not lose it because, of its own motion, it becomes an efficient working body which anybody undertaking to obey its discipline and conditions of membership may join.
('81', 419, 1, 5, 709542) The Congress will cease to be popular, if it cannot deserve popularity in times of stress.
('81', 419, 1, 6, 709633) If it cannot provide work for the workless and hungry, if it cannot protect the people from depredations or teach them how to face them, if it cannot help them in the face of danger, it will lose its prestige and popularity.
('81', 419, 1, 7, 709858) No person or corporation can live long on his or its capital.
('81', 419, 1, 8, 709920) The latter has to circulate and multiply itself.
('81', 419, 1, 9, 709969) The Congress has become popular because it has been foremost in fighting imperialism.
('81', 419, 1, 10, 710055) Today the old way is of no avail.
('81', 419, 1, 11, 710089) Nobody thinks of mass revolt at the present moment.
('81', 419, 1, 12, 710141) The best, quickest and most efficient way is to build up from the bottom.
('81', 419, 1, 13, 710215) The psychological moment has come.
('81', 419, 1, 14, 710250) Back to the villages! has become a necessity from every point of view.
('81', 419, 1, 15, 710321) Now is the time to decentralize production and distribution.
('81', 419, 1, 16, 710382) Every village has to become a self sufficient repu blic.
('81', 419, 1, 17, 710439) This does not require brave resolutions.
('81', 419, 1, 18, 710480) It requires brave, corporate, intelligent work.
('81', 419, 1, 19, 710528) As far as I know at the present moment this is common ground between the rulers and the people.
('81', 419, 1, 20, 710624) Let every Congressman answer for himself whether he will be a soldier or servant of peace or whether he will become a non entity unwilling to take his place in building up swaraj.

('81', 419, 2, 22, 710864) 692. WHY?
('81', 419, 3, 23, 710874) While I was engaged in organizing and conducting the civil disobedience movement on behalf of the Congress I could not issue the three weeklies without noticing the doings of civil resisters and the general progress of the movement.
('81', 419, 3, 24, 711107) That would have been to turn the weeklies into civil disobedience organs and to challenge the Govern ment to suppress them.
('81', 419, 3, 25, 711231) The Government in their turn could not but have accepted the challenge and suppressed the papers and even prosecuted me.
('81', 419, 3, 26, 711352) Whilst I must always be ready to welcome imprison ment, I was not then ready to court it.
('81', 419, 3, 27, 711442) Nor was it my plan to invite suppression when my avowed object was to organize strictly and only individual civil disobedience.
('81', 419, 3, 28, 711570) Therefore, even at the price of sacrifi cing the pleasure of serving the people in various ways through the
('81', 420, 0, 1, 711678) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARTY, 1942 421
('81', 420, 1, 2, 711726) weeklies, duty demanded their stoppage.
('81', 420, 1, 3, 711766) I feel that the step taken was correct in every way.
('81', 420, 1, 4, 711819) The reason for suspension now no longer exists.
('81', 420, 1, 5, 711867) On the contrary I should fail in my duty, if I did not resume publication.
('81', 420, 1, 6, 711942) As I have repeatedly said I am no enemy of Britain.
('81', 420, 1, 7, 711994) I have many dear and personal friends among Britishers.
('81', 420, 1, 8, 712050) I cannot wish ill to Britain.
('81', 420, 1, 9, 712080) My resistance to war does not carry me to the point of thwarting those who wish to take part in it.
('81', 420, 1, 10, 712180) I reason with them.
('81', 420, 1, 11, 712200) I put before them the better way and leave them to make the choice.
('81', 420, 1, 12, 712268) But we have arrived at a stage where it is no longer merely a question of resisting war effort.
('81', 420, 1, 13, 712364) There are questions which confront war resisters as much as they confront war mongers.
('81', 420, 1, 14, 712451) And they can be decided only one way by both, though the approach must vary.
('81', 420, 1, 15, 712528) Such are questions of dealing with scarcity of food and clothing, looting and bread riots, etc.
('81', 420, 1, 16, 712624) I have views on all these and like questions.
('81', 420, 1, 17, 712670) Resumption of the weeklies is needed for the dissemination of my views on these and like matters.
('81', 420, 1, 18, 712768) In the ability of the people to deal with them without fuss and even without Government effort lies the way to swaraj whose basis is non violence.
('81', 420, 1, 19, 712915) Mere Government effort cannot deal with crises affecting millions of people unless there is voluntary response from them.
('81', 420, 1, 20, 713037) If we wish to achieve swaraj through truth and non violence, gradual but steady building up from the bottom upwards by construc tive effort is the only way.
('81', 420, 1, 21, 713194) This rules out the deliberate creation of an anarchical state for the overthrow of the established order in the hope of throwing up from within a dictator who would rule with a rod of iron and produce order out of disorder.
('81', 420, 1, 22, 713418) These columns will then deal with the day to day problems that face the people.

('81', 420, 4, 26, 713615) I knew the Sardars power of organization, but I discovered for the first time that the Sardar was a skilled agriculturist.
('81', 420, 4, 27, 713738) Every inch of space in the banana garden and every drop of water that was being given to it had been made careful use of.

('81', 421, 1, 3, 714215) Surrounding the garden had been planted permanent trees, and inside the garden were walks making it easy for the field worker to take care of the trees and also providing enough space with velvety earth for those who desired to have their morning and evening constitutional.
('81', 421, 1, 4, 714490) All this was enough to rest and please the eyes and the mind.
('81', 421, 1, 5, 714552) The Sardars labour had yielded the Ashram several thousand rupees and set an example to others.

('81', 422, 11, 18, 716115) PRABHAVATI, I had dictated two letters to you C/o Brij Bihari 3. The address was given by you.
('81', 422, 11, 19, 716210) You need not get frightened by anybodys criticism.

('81', 423, 5, 12, 716942) In my part of India shells and seedless dried almonds were used as coins accepted by the people and the State treasury.
('81', 423, 5, 13, 717062) They had no intrinsic value.
('81', 423, 5, 14, 717091) They were a measure of peoples deep poverty.
('81', 423, 5, 15, 717136) They could not afford the lowest metal coin.
('81', 423, 5, 16, 717181) Five shells would buy them a little vegetable or a needle.
('81', 423, 5, 17, 717240) I have suggested a measure which will not be a mere token but which will have always an intrinsic value which will also be its market value.
('81', 423, 5, 18, 717381) In that sense it will be an ideal measure.
('81', 423, 5, 19, 717424) For the present and by way of experiment I have suggested a warp length of a single thread of yarn as the lowest measure and to be used in dealings principally with the spinners and generally with khadi lovers.
('81', 423, 5, 20, 717635) The spinners can have all their daily wants supplied as against a fixed quantity of yarn.
('81', 423, 5, 21, 717725) Stores will need to be maintained by the A. I. S. A. in combination with the A. I. V. I. A. and ultimately with those who will give their co operation.
('81', 423, 5, 22, 717877) As I conceive it, the system can be worked only if it is decentralized.
('81', 423, 5, 23, 717949) This is not its demerit but merit.
('81', 423, 5, 24, 717984) The end to be sought is human happiness combined with full mental and moral development.
('81', 423, 5, 25, 718073) I use the adjective moral as synonymous with spiritual.
('81', 423, 5, 26, 718129) This end can be achieved under decentralization.
('81', 423, 5, 27, 718178) Centrali zation as a system is inconsistent with non violent structure of society.
('81', 423, 5, 28, 718261) I have presented to khadi workers and those who are interested in the solution of the problem of Indias poverty, the idea of a measure of value in its barest outline.
('81', 423, 5, 29, 718428) Let them work it out and find for them selves flaws, if any, in the conception, and if they do not, let them enforce it where they can.

('81', 424, 2, 3, 718712) January 13, 1942 I have felled hundreds of palm trees with my own hands, and got them felled before my eyes.
('81', 424, 2, 4, 718821) I cannot bring those trees back.
('81', 424, 2, 5, 718854) According to your argument any tree can be cut down.
('81', 424, 2, 6, 718907) Of course, it is all right that you did what you deemed proper.
('81', 424, 2, 7, 718971) I am pained that you cut down so many trees without consulting the others.
('81', 424, 2, 8, 719046) The palm is a poor mans tree.
('81', 424, 2, 9, 719076) Do I have to explain to you its usefulness?
('81', 424, 2, 10, 719120) If all the palm trees are cut down, life at Sevagram will be severely affected.
('81', 424, 2, 11, 719200) The palm tree is interwoven with our life.
('81', 424, 2, 12, 719243) Grass, etc., could have been sown in some other place.
('81', 424, 2, 13, 719298) But you should not brood over it.
('81', 424, 2, 14, 719332) It would be good if you take whatever lesson you can from it.
('81', 424, 2, 15, 719394) I cannot spare any time.
('81', 424, 2, 16, 719419) Speak to Gajanan 1; explain this to others.
('81', 424, 2, 17, 719463) Assess the utility of the palm tree.

('81', 424, 6, 21, 719579) The late Sir Akbar Hydari 3 was a rare combination.
('81', 424, 6, 22, 719631) He was a great scholar, philosopher and reformer.
('81', 424, 6, 23, 719681) He was a devout Muslim, but he saw nothing antagonistic to Islam in Hinduism.
('81', 424, 6, 24, 719759) He was a student of various religions.
('81', 424, 6, 25, 719798) He was catholic in the choice of his friends.
('81', 424, 6, 26, 719844) On the return voyage from the second Round Table Conference 4 we found ourselves in the same boat.
('81', 424, 6, 27, 719943) He was a regular attendant at the evening prayers I used to have on board.
('81', 424, 6, 28, 720018) He was so interested in the Gita verses and the bhajans we sang that he had got them all translated for him by Mahadev Desai.
('81', 424, 6, 29, 720144) He had made me promise that we should tour together in India the interest of communal unity.
('81', 424, 6, 30, 720237) But God had willed otherwise.
('81', 424, 6, 31, 720267) The late Lord Willingdon had a different programme for me.
('81', 424, 6, 32, 720326) I was plunged into the civil disobedience fight.
('81', 424, 6, 33, 720375) Sir Akbar and I could never carry out the programme.

('81', 425, 4, 9, 721008) DEAR SIR FRANCIS WYLIE 1, Rajkumari showed me your letter containing reference to me.
('81', 425, 4, 10, 721094) I must plead guilty.
('81', 425, 4, 11, 721115) I was angry over what I considered to be unworthy of you of whom I had glowing accounts.
('81', 425, 4, 12, 721204) I had been told that you were a follower of Tolstoy.
('81', 425, 4, 13, 721257) I could not very well write to you about my great grief.
('81', 425, 4, 14, 721314) For though I have accepted your adjective, I was more grieved than angry.
('81', 425, 4, 15, 721388) Needless to say that I would have been delighted to have your son with me.
('81', 425, 4, 16, 721463) He would have enjoyed the novel life at Sevagram.
('81', 425, 4, 17, 721513) And of course I was and am sorry that we could not meet each other though we were so near each other.
('81', 425, 4, 18, 721615) I hope you are having a pleasant time in Afghanistan, if any where at this time life could be called pleasant.

('81', 425, 8, 27, 722062) She should promise her mother that she will not marry Kanu without her blessing, but that she will marry no other person.
('81', 425, 8, 28, 722184) Abha shall remain under my charge.

('81', 426, 3, 8, 722630) Cant you stay in the room next to Champas?
('81', 426, 3, 9, 722673) If you cannot do that, will you stay in the same block?
('81', 426, 3, 10, 722729) If you cannot do even that, you may stay in my room.
('81', 426, 3, 11, 722782) You will not be a burden to me.
('81', 426, 3, 12, 722814) You will get there privacy, too.
('81', 426, 3, 13, 722847) I will not mind .
('81', 426, 3, 14, 722865) 1 In short, I will make whatever arrangements you wish.

('81', 426, 3, 20, 723134) He will be able to find an attendant.

('81', 427, 2, 3, 723786) WARDHA, January 15, 1942 The President has put me in a quandary by raising me skyhigh, as if, one may think, I were a dweller in the clouds.
('81', 427, 2, 4, 723927) That is not at all true.
('81', 427, 2, 5, 723952) I have not yet used an aeroplaneof course, I have seen them flying in the skies, like birds but I have not touched one.
('81', 427, 2, 6, 724072) So the question of flying does not arise.
('81', 427, 2, 7, 724114) It is misuse of language to call such a man a dweller in the skies.
('81', 427, 2, 8, 724182) I am of the earth, earthy.
('81', 427, 2, 9, 724209) I am an ordi nary mortal composed of common clay.
('81', 427, 2, 10, 724259) The question of ahimsa would not have come up before you, had it not come up before the Working Committee at Bardoli.
('81', 427, 2, 11, 724377) We discussed it for seven days.
('81', 427, 2, 12, 724409) And it was well that it came up.
('81', 427, 2, 13, 724442) The result has been good, not bad.
('81', 427, 2, 14, 724477) But before I say anything on this question, let me make one or two things clear.
('81', 427, 2, 15, 724558) Please note that I am, as I have said, an ordinary mortal like you.
('81', 427, 2, 16, 724626) Had this not been the case, we should not have been able to work together these twenty years.
('81', 427, 2, 17, 724720) Ahimsa with me is a creed, the breath of life.
('81', 427, 2, 18, 724767) But it is never as a creed that I placed it before India or, for that matter, before anyone except in casual or informal talks.
('81', 427, 2, 19, 724895) I placed it before the Congress as a political weapon, to be employed for the solution of political problems.
('81', 427, 2, 20, 725005) It is a new experiment in ahimsa which I have undertaken.
('81', 427, 2, 21, 725063) As far as I am aware, no one has hitherto em ployed ahimsa in the political arena in this manner.
('81', 427, 2, 22, 725161) If someone has, at least I am not aware of it.
('81', 427, 2, 23, 725208) Maybe it is a novel method, but it does not on that account lose its political character.
('81', 427, 2, 24, 725298) I tried this for the first time in South Africa, with good results.
('81', 427, 2, 25, 725366) I have brought it from there.
('81', 427, 2, 26, 725396) The question there was exclusively of the political existence of Indians who had no political consciousness but had settled in South Africa as merchants, petty hawkers, etc.
('81', 427, 2, 27, 725570) And there I used ahimsa as a political weapon.
('81', 427, 2, 28, 725617) It was for them a question of life and death.
('81', 427, 2, 29, 725663) The whites wanted them to quit.
('81', 427, 2, 30, 725695) They had only two alternatives.
('81', 427, 2, 31, 725727) They could either quit or stay there with the status of animals.
('81', 427, 2, 32, 725792) We tried everything that was humanly possible.
('81', 427, 2, 33, 725839) We found that all the so called constitutional remedies, with which the Congress work in India had made me familiar, had failed.
('81', 427, 2, 34, 725968) I was an expert in petition writing which had yielded me lots of money.
('81', 427, 2, 35, 726040) I have been for long a draftsman for

('81', 428, 1, 2, 726268) the Congress here, which work I used to do there also.
('81', 428, 1, 3, 726323) They submitted many petitions, but when all other methods failed they resorted to satyagraha.
('81', 428, 1, 4, 726417) The various measures that I adopted there were not the work of a visionary or a dreamer.
('81', 428, 1, 5, 726506) They were the work of an essen tially practical man dealing with practical political questions.
('81', 428, 1, 6, 726602) As a political method, it can always be changed, modified, altered, even given up in preference to another.
('81', 428, 1, 7, 726710) If, therefore, I say to you that our policy should not be given up today, I am talking political wisdom.
('81', 428, 1, 8, 726815) It is political insight.
('81', 428, 1, 9, 726840) It has served us in the past, it has enabled us to traverse many stages towards independence, and it is a politician that I tell you that it would be a grave mistake to think of giving it up.
('81', 428, 1, 10, 727032) If I have carried the Congress with me all these years, it is in my capacity as a politician.
('81', 428, 1, 11, 727126) It is hardly fair to describe my method as religious because it is new.
('81', 428, 1, 12, 727198) Maulana Saheb has affectionately used high words of praise for me, but I cannot accept them.
('81', 428, 1, 13, 727291) A thing can yet be discarded after showering all praise on it.
('81', 428, 1, 14, 727354) A person can be raised sky high and then cast down to the dust.
('81', 428, 1, 15, 727418) I have been taunted as a Bania.
('81', 428, 1, 16, 727450) It is all right.
('81', 428, 1, 17, 727467) How can I help it?
('81', 428, 1, 18, 727486) I was born a Bania.
('81', 428, 1, 19, 727506) I shall stay a Bania and shall die as a Bania.
('81', 428, 1, 20, 727553) Trade is my profession.
('81', 428, 1, 21, 727577) I am trading with you and with the world.
('81', 428, 1, 22, 727619) The article in my possession is an invaluable pearl.
('81', 428, 1, 23, 727672) It has to be weighed in the proper scalesas Maulana Saheb rightly said, pearls, grass and men need different scales.
('81', 428, 1, 24, 727789) I am a trader in ahimsa.
('81', 428, 1, 25, 727814) Those who can pay the price for it may have it.
('81', 428, 1, 26, 727862) In my view, it cannot be bartered away even for independence.
('81', 428, 1, 27, 727924) But you do not value this thing as I do; because you do not have the scales with which to weigh it.
('81', 428, 1, 28, 728024) Please do not think that I am speaking to you from a high pedestal.
('81', 428, 1, 29, 728092) The simple question is why are we prepared today to discard a thing which we have cherished for so many years.
('81', 428, 1, 30, 728203) No doubt, you have not discarded it yet, but you will if your terms are accepted.
('81', 428, 1, 31, 728285) This much I am able to see.
('81', 428, 1, 32, 728313) I do not raise the question of what we shall do after swaraj.
('81', 428, 1, 33, 728375) I am myself not aware what I will do after swaraj.
('81', 428, 1, 34, 728426) But today you are eager to barter away ahimsa for swaraj.
('81', 428, 1, 35, 728484) You had taken a pledge that you would win swaraj only through ahimsa, and through no other means.
('81', 428, 1, 36, 728582) Today you are ready to depart from it.
('81', 428, 1, 37, 728621) I want to tell you that this bargain will not bring you complete independence.
('81', 428, 1, 38, 728700) Independence for me means the independence of the humblest and poorest among us.
('81', 428, 1, 39, 728781) Today we are at the threshold of independence on the strength of ahimsa.
('81', 428, 1, 40, 728854) For the Congress to abandon ahimsa and to
('81', 429, 0, 1, 728896) 430 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 429, 1, 2, 728938) join war 1 is to undo the work of the past twenty years.
('81', 429, 1, 3, 728995) It is my discomfiture that I could not make you see this.
('81', 429, 1, 4, 729053) This is not the time for counting votes.
('81', 429, 1, 5, 729094) In spite of holding this view, I stand before you today to plead with you to accept this resolution 2, and not even to divide the house.
('81', 429, 1, 6, 729231) If I can convince you of this, you should accept my advice, otherwise leave it.
('81', 429, 1, 7, 729311) This is not the time when we may canvass support for our groups and seek a vote.
('81', 429, 1, 8, 729392) If we merely talk tall about independence but do nothing to attain it, how can we aspire for it?
('81', 429, 1, 9, 729489) I had once said that everyone would become his own leader after my arrest.
('81', 429, 1, 10, 729564) Today also you can become your own leaders and think for yourselves.
('81', 429, 1, 11, 729633) But I want you to remember one thing.
('81', 429, 1, 12, 729671) I am a man who wont exchange ahimsa even for independence; and yet I am giving you this advice as an exponent of ahimsa.
('81', 429, 1, 13, 729792) Along with this, I wish to reiterate that I do not wish to with draw a single word from what I had written about the Poona Resolution and I have no regrets for what I said.
('81', 429, 1, 14, 729965) However, the Bardoli Resolution, though it looks like the Poona Resolution, is a different thing.
('81', 429, 1, 15, 730063) The Poona Resolution attempted to interpret ahimsa.
('81', 429, 1, 16, 730115) The Bardoli Reso lution does not do so.
('81', 429, 1, 17, 730155) The Poona Resolution was the outcome of my mistake for which I have already atoned.
('81', 429, 1, 18, 730239) But the Bardoli Resolution is the outcome of deliberations over many days.
('81', 429, 1, 19, 730314) At one time after the Bardoli Resolution, I had thought of dividing the A. I. C. C. and testing how many members supported my view.
('81', 429, 1, 20, 730446) But as the situation developed stage by stage, as I saw the climate in the country and the criticism of our Congress in the world, I came to the conclusion on the basis of my ahimsa that if I could persuade the A. I. C. C. I should advise them to accept this resolution deliberately and whole heartedly.
('81', 429, 1, 21, 730750) My advice to those who agree with me, that is, to those who have faith in total ahimsa, is to remain neutral and not vote for or against the resolution.
('81', 429, 1, 22, 730903) But if their abstention helps the opponents of this resolution to defeat it, they should vote in support of this resolution and not allow it to be defeated.
('81', 429, 1, 23, 731060) I have no doubt that the Working Committee has taken a retro grade step in passing this resolution.
('81', 429, 1, 24, 731160) Rajaji may not agree, because he thinks I am in the wrong.
('81', 429, 1, 25, 731219) Jawaharlal also may say that there is no retrograde step in this resolution.
('81', 429, 1, 26, 731296) But in my opinion this step back is a prelude to a step forward.
('81', 429, 1, 27, 731361) A withdrawal sometimes becomes necessary.
('81', 429, 1, 28, 731403) We have a right to take a step back for jumping forward.

('81', 430, 1, 2, 731717) Therefore a man who has parted company with you, who claims to be a satyagrahi and in whose life there is no room for tactical mani pulations comes to you and advises you to accept this resolution, how ever imperfect, because it correctly reflects the Congress mind.
('81', 430, 1, 3, 731984) Even if the protagonists of ahimsa have a majority in this house, they should help the adoption of this resolution.
('81', 430, 1, 4, 732100) The Congress does not know its own mind but I know that the attitude of the Congress is reflected in this resolution.
('81', 430, 1, 5, 732218) The Congress has a great reputation.
('81', 430, 1, 6, 732255) This resolution has enhan ced it.
('81', 430, 1, 7, 732289) The whole world is watching us, the eyes of our countrymen are fixed on us.
('81', 430, 1, 8, 732365) Several people contemplated the prospect with trepidation, lest the Congress should flounder in response to Gandhis formula and become a religious organization instead of a political one.
('81', 430, 1, 9, 732553) Let me dispel their fear, and say that the Congress which accepted ahimsa as a creed can do no such thing, that we have not wasted the past twenty years.
('81', 430, 1, 10, 732707) Whatever a doubting Thomas may think, when the moment of settlement arrives in Delhi, everyone will realize that the Congress remains the same with or without Gandhi.
('81', 430, 1, 11, 732874) The language may differ, but the demand will remain the same.
('81', 430, 1, 12, 732936) No one can cheat it.
('81', 430, 1, 13, 732957) It will go on repeating Neti, neti 1 until it wins the real substance it wants.
('81', 430, 1, 14, 733037) If you can get what you want and you strike the bargain, you may be sure that I will not shed a single tear.
('81', 430, 1, 15, 733146) If I am allowed to vent my views through my three weeklies, you will find me saying that I did become a trader but I could not sell my ahimsa.
('81', 430, 1, 16, 733289) Whatever, therefore, our opponents inside and outside India may think and feel happy about, I wont let them say that Gandhi was after all a crazy person.
('81', 430, 1, 17, 733443) I do not want the Congress to look ridiculous in the eyes of the world.
('81', 430, 1, 18, 733515) I do not want it to be said that in order to retain my leadership you bade good bye to your senses because you had no courage to give give me up.
('81', 430, 1, 19, 733661) I do not covet leadership by undermining anyones manhood.
('81', 430, 1, 20, 733719) If the Congress alters its resolution for fear of losing my leadership and if I allow this transaction, this will result in the degradation of the Congress as well as my own.
('81', 430, 1, 21, 733894) This is not the way I work.
('81', 430, 1, 22, 733922) It is a fraudulent way.
('81', 430, 1, 23, 733946) Am I going to cheat the Congress after fifty years of national service?
('81', 430, 1, 24, 734018) I have removed the very roots of this risk.
('81', 430, 1, 25, 734062) I have told Maulana Saheb that you have not lost me by relieving me.
('81', 430, 1, 26, 734131) You would lose me only if I cease to be loyal to the Congress, only if I become a visionary, only if I cease to be a practical man.
('81', 430, 1, 27, 734263) It is not at Bardoli that

('81', 431, 1, 2, 734516) I left the Congress; I did so seven years ago in Bombay 1 and I did so in order to be able to render greater service to the country and the Congress.
('81', 431, 1, 3, 734666) If I am relinquishing the Congress now, I do so only to serve it better.
('81', 431, 1, 4, 734739) Colleagues like the Sardar and Rajendra Babu are not happy over the resolution but I am asking them not to leave the Congress.
('81', 431, 1, 5, 734866) If the real hour for leaving the Congress arrives, and if they continue to cling to their present convictions, then they may say good bye to the Congress.
('81', 431, 1, 6, 735021) But even if they leave the Congress, the Congress is not going to cease to function.
('81', 431, 1, 7, 735106) Its work will go on whether they are there or not.
('81', 431, 1, 8, 735157) No man, however great, is indispensable to the Congress.
('81', 431, 1, 9, 735214) Those who built up the Congress like Dadabhai, Phero zeshah and Lokamanya are no more, but the Congress still functions.
('81', 431, 1, 10, 735335) For they have left for us an edifice to work upon and expand.
('81', 431, 1, 11, 735397) Why should then my withdrawal or that of other leaders make any difference?
('81', 431, 1, 12, 735473) The Congress will survive and will strike the bargain it is striving for.
('81', 431, 1, 13, 735547) I wish to stop you from dividing the house by seeking a vote on this resolution.
('81', 431, 1, 14, 735628) I do not want the Congress to look ridiculous in the eyes of the world.
('81', 431, 1, 15, 735700) We have not a clean slate to write on.
('81', 431, 1, 16, 735739) Our leaders have taken a step which has produced world wide reactions.
('81', 431, 1, 17, 735810) To alter the resolution out of shape is to ignore these.
('81', 431, 1, 18, 735867) It would be unwise to change the policy adopted by the Working Committee.
('81', 431, 1, 19, 735941) It will make the Congress appear ridiculous before the world.
('81', 431, 1, 20, 736003) The world has a right to expect that the Working Committees policy will be endorsed by the A. I. C. C. We have no valid grounds to alter it.
('81', 431, 1, 21, 736144) To those who want to catch up with me and introduce a new resolution for preser ving ahimsa, I would say: Yes, it does bring you credit.
('81', 431, 1, 22, 736281) If you have chewed and digested ahimsa, I shall follow in your footsteps and so will Maulana Saheb.
('81', 431, 1, 23, 736381) But I see no such evidence in you.
('81', 431, 1, 24, 736416) If you bring another resolution merely to retain my leadership, it will be a foolish step.
('81', 431, 1, 25, 736507) In fact, it will amount to violence.
('81', 431, 1, 26, 736544) Therefore you should accept this resolution, however imperfect it may be. Do not please go away with the idea that there is a rift in the Congress lute.
('81', 431, 1, 27, 736697) As Maulana Saheb has said, the Working Committee has functioned like members of a happy family.
('81', 431, 1, 28, 736793) Somebody suggested that Pandit Jawaharlal and I were estranged.
('81', 431, 1, 29, 736857) This is baseless.
('81', 431, 1, 30, 736875) Jawa harlal has been resisting me ever since he fell into my net.
('81', 431, 1, 31, 736941) You cannot divide water by repeatedly striking it with a stick.
('81', 431, 1, 32, 737005) It is just as difficult to divide us.

('81', 432, 1, 2, 737232) Vallabhbhai 1, but Jawaharlal will be my successor.
('81', 432, 1, 3, 737284) He says whatever is uppermost in his mind, but he always does what I want.
('81', 432, 1, 4, 737359) When I am gone he will do what I am doing now.
('81', 432, 1, 5, 737406) Then he will speak my language too.
('81', 432, 1, 6, 737442) After all he was born in this land.
('81', 432, 1, 7, 737478) Every day he learns some new thing.
('81', 432, 1, 8, 737514) He fights with me because I am there.
('81', 432, 1, 9, 737552) Whom will he fight when I am gone?
('81', 432, 1, 10, 737587) And who will suffer his fighting?
('81', 432, 1, 11, 737621) Ultimately, he will have to speak my language.
('81', 432, 1, 12, 737668) Even if this does not happen, I would at least die with this faith.
('81', 432, 1, 13, 737736) There is another reason why this resolution should be supported.
('81', 432, 1, 14, 737801) (By chance this resolution has) become a mirror of the Congress in which all groups can see themselves.
('81', 432, 1, 15, 737905) I can see my own reflection, and so can Rajendra Babu, Badshah Khan, Sardar and the rest.
('81', 432, 1, 16, 737995) Those who have spent a lifetime in cursing the Government as also those who wish to compromise with the Government can see their own reflections in this mirror.
('81', 432, 1, 17, 738156) Maulana Saheb has not properly described how this resolution was framed.
('81', 432, 1, 18, 738229) This is not the resolution as drafted by Jawaharlal.
('81', 432, 1, 19, 738282) His draft has been materially amended.
('81', 432, 1, 20, 738321) Rajaji also had a hand in revising it.
('81', 432, 1, 21, 738360) People have an erroneous impression about Jawaharlal that he never budges from his views.
('81', 432, 1, 22, 738450) Today at least he cannot get that certificate.
('81', 432, 1, 23, 738497) He argues vehemently, but when the time for action arrives, he can make considerable compromises.
('81', 432, 1, 24, 738595) This resolution is a product of a general consensus.
('81', 432, 1, 25, 738648) The views of all the members of the Working Committee are reflected in this resolution.
('81', 432, 1, 26, 738736) Like khichri it contains pulses, rice, salt, chilli and spices.
('81', 432, 1, 27, 738800) Maulana Saheb has already explained the different points of view within the Working Committee.
('81', 432, 1, 28, 738895) We have many groups amongst us.
('81', 432, 1, 29, 738927) One is represented by Jawaharlal.
('81', 432, 1, 30, 738961) His opposition to participation in the war effort is almost as strong as mine, though his reasons are different.
('81', 432, 1, 31, 739074) He will not concede that he has retraced his steps in consenting to this resolution.
('81', 432, 1, 32, 739159) But he himself will agree that the Rajaji group can take a different view of this resolution.
('81', 432, 1, 33, 739253) The original draft had left no room for Rajaji and his followers to function.
('81', 432, 1, 34, 739331) Rajaji would like to participate in the war effort if the Government accepted the conditions laid down by the Congress.
('81', 432, 1, 35, 739451) So he has opened a tiny window for himself.
('81', 432, 1, 36, 739495) Through this window Rajaji will try to pull Jawahar towards him and Jawahar will pull in the opposite direction.
('81', 432, 1, 37, 739608) It is no longer open to the Government and the Congress critics to say that the Congress has banged the door against negotiation on the

('81', 433, 0, 1, 739808) 434 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 433, 1, 2, 739850) doctrinaire ground of non violence.
('81', 433, 1, 3, 739886) The resolution throws on the Government the entire burden of wooing the Congress by meeting its legitimate demands and securing its participation in the war effort.
('81', 433, 1, 4, 740051) That nothing much is to be expected from the Government is probably too true.
('81', 433, 1, 5, 740129) Only the resolution puts the Congress right with the expectant world by debunking the criticism that the Congress is an organization of doctrinaires.
('81', 433, 1, 6, 740279) And since there is a party in the Congress ready to welcome an honourable offer that will satisfy the rigidest test, it is as well that the resolution has accommodated this party.
('81', 433, 1, 7, 740459) It has to be seen which group ultimately pulls the others.
('81', 433, 1, 8, 740518) Whichever group wins, how can it harm us?
('81', 433, 1, 9, 740560) We need have no objection.
('81', 433, 1, 10, 740587) Although different points of view have thus been accommo dated in this resolution, it is not open to the charge of duplicity.
('81', 433, 1, 11, 740713) It seeks to give an opportunity to different points of view to influence one another.
('81', 433, 1, 12, 740799) This is how I understand it.
('81', 433, 1, 13, 740828) Jawahar, Rajaji, Rajendra Babu as well as a man like me have each some elbow room in this resolution.
('81', 433, 1, 14, 740930) How does this resolution leave scope for Rajendra Babu?
('81', 433, 1, 15, 740986) We have contemplated some step for the future, which upsets him.
('81', 433, 1, 16, 741051) But we are not here to decide what we shall do in the future.
('81', 433, 1, 17, 741113) When India becomes free, the resolution says, we can defend ourselves with arms.
('81', 433, 1, 18, 741194) If we wish to help China and Russia, the resolution leaves us free to do so.
('81', 433, 1, 19, 741271) We have no ill will against the Britishers, and for that matter against Germans, Italians or Japanese.
('81', 433, 1, 20, 741374) How then can we have an ill will against China and Russia?
('81', 433, 1, 21, 741433) The Russians 1 have created a brave new thing.
('81', 433, 1, 22, 741480) But I have my doubts as to how long they can defend their freedom in this manner.
('81', 433, 1, 23, 741562) Experience tells us that any great work founded on force does not last.
('81', 433, 1, 24, 741634) The Chinese sail in the same boat with us.
('81', 433, 1, 25, 741677) It is a vast country and I am proud of it.
('81', 433, 1, 26, 741720) I would like all these nations to be at peace with one another.
('81', 433, 1, 27, 741784) If China seeks to defend herself with arms, she will have to become like Japan.
('81', 433, 1, 28, 741864) She will have to do everything that Hitler and Mussolini are doing.
('81', 433, 1, 29, 741932) I would like to think that when the occasion arises India would defend herself through non violence and thus be a messenger of peace to the whole world.
('81', 433, 1, 30, 742085) Jawahar will also then work for itnot for war.
('81', 433, 1, 31, 742132) Rajendra Babu can therefore support this resolution.
('81', 433, 1, 32, 742185) As a political [weapon] non violence is no small thing; it can bring about all these results.

('81', 434, 1, 2, 742406) You should all remember that non violence is the common factor among Jawaharlal, Rajaji, Rajendra Babu and Maulana Saheb.
('81', 434, 1, 3, 742528) We are all agreed that today we have to work only through non violence.
('81', 434, 1, 4, 742600) We will think of other things at the appropriate time.
('81', 434, 1, 5, 742655) That is why I find myself supporting this resolution.
('81', 434, 1, 6, 742709) Rajendra Babu can today propagate to his hearts content the message of ahimsa from the Congress platform.
('81', 434, 1, 7, 742815) This resolution leaves him free to do so.
('81', 434, 1, 8, 742857) Besides this, the instructions about the constructive programme 1 for Congress men will promote ahimsa.
('81', 434, 1, 9, 742961) It includes almost all the items of the thirteen point constructive programme put forward by me.
('81', 434, 1, 10, 743058) The U. P. Congress Committee has recently passed a resolution which is praiseworthy.
('81', 434, 1, 11, 743143) It refers to ahimsa too.
('81', 434, 1, 12, 743168) It covers everything that I should like it to.
('81', 434, 1, 13, 743215) We have made a clean breast of everything in this resolution.
('81', 434, 1, 14, 743277) When all of us are sailing in the same boat, why do you want to introduce a new resolution?
('81', 434, 1, 15, 743369) Ahimsa is not a thing which can be established through mechanical means.
('81', 434, 1, 16, 743442) Did I serve the Congress for the last twenty years on the strength of a vote?
('81', 434, 1, 17, 743520) On the contrary, when matters reached the stage demanding a vote I voluntarily retired from the Congress.
('81', 434, 1, 18, 743626) Voting is all right in small matters, but our work will be hampered if we decide larger issues by vote.
('81', 434, 1, 19, 743730) The Congress is like a non violent army.
('81', 434, 1, 20, 743771) Our effort will be to keep it non violent to the end.
('81', 434, 1, 21, 743825) I am not going to restrain it if on the basis of experience we realize that we were on the wrong path.
('81', 434, 1, 22, 743928) The real strength of the Congress lies in those people who are outside the Congress but rally to its support when the call goes out.
('81', 434, 1, 23, 744061) They do not care for name or fame, nor have they any personal axe to grind.
('81', 434, 1, 24, 744137) We have to become their true representatives.
('81', 434, 1, 25, 744183) You have to forge the Congress into a strong, solid and disciplined organization.
('81', 434, 1, 26, 744265) In the past 15 months Congressmen have evinced some sense of discipline.
('81', 434, 1, 27, 744338) Occasionally there were lapses but I tolerated them because I had to steer the Congress ship.
('81', 434, 1, 28, 744432) But now we shall have to observe stricter discipline.
('81', 434, 1, 29, 744486) The time has now arrived when the Congress should act with one mind.
('81', 434, 1, 30, 744555) The ultimate weapon of the Congress today is ahimsa.
('81', 434, 1, 31, 744608) Until this creed is altered, no Congressman can preach violence openly or secretly.
('81', 434, 1, 32, 744692) If he does so, he will be disloyal.
('81', 434, 1, 33, 744728) No one can however judge what lies inside a mans heart.
('81', 434, 1, 34, 744784) But we will have to enlist all those who promise to march in step with us.
('81', 434, 1, 35, 744859) This resolution keeps the door open for every honest Congressman.
('81', 434, 1, 36, 744925) Finally, some friends ask, What has the Congress done, after all? They complain that the resolution has no operative clause.
('81', 434, 2, 37, 745050) 1 Vide Appendix Congress Working Committees Instructions, 25 1 1942.
('81', 435, 0, 1, 745119) 436 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 435, 1, 2, 745161) complaint is true so far as the resolution is concerned.
('81', 435, 1, 3, 745218) The Congress will issue separate instructions for this purpose.
('81', 435, 1, 4, 745282) The resolution had to be merely explanatory.
('81', 435, 1, 5, 745327) It is addressed less to Congressmen than to the world.
('81', 435, 1, 6, 745382) It is not even addressed to the Government.
('81', 435, 1, 7, 745426) Let there be no misunderstanding nor lack of zeal among Congressmen because the resolution has postponed satyagraha.
('81', 435, 1, 8, 745543) Neither Jawaharlal nor Rajaji will let you remain idle.
('81', 435, 1, 9, 745599) I certainly will not.
('81', 435, 1, 10, 745621) Let those who think the constructive programme is insipid know that there is nothing in the Working Committees resolution to prevent a Congressman at his own risk from leading civil disobedience individual or mass.
('81', 435, 1, 11, 745836) If he succeeds, he will win nothing but praise from all and I myself will kiss his feet.
('81', 435, 1, 12, 745925) The more a person advances in ahimsa, the more proud will the Congress feel of him.
('81', 435, 1, 13, 746009) But such advance should not need any imprimatur from the Congress.
('81', 435, 1, 14, 746076) But let me warn the enthusiasts that they will not handle the weapon with any success.
('81', 435, 1, 15, 746163) They will only damage themselves and the cause by any hasty or ignorant action.
('81', 435, 1, 16, 746243) And let me say as an expert in the art of satyagraha that those who regard the constructive programme as insipid do not know what non violence is and how it works.
('81', 435, 1, 17, 746407) So much for civil disobedience.
('81', 435, 1, 18, 746439) Let us now turn to the parliamentary mentality.
('81', 435, 1, 19, 746487) Though it has come to stay in spite of my efforts to eradicate it, the parlia mentary programme can, I hold, have no place in Congress work so long as the war lasts.
('81', 435, 1, 20, 746653) The Congress cannot handle it without identi fying itself with the war effort.
('81', 435, 1, 21, 746732) I have always held that at all times it is the least important part of a nations activity.
('81', 435, 1, 22, 746823) Legislators are not the masters but servants of their electorsthe nation.
('81', 435, 1, 23, 746897) The less, therefore, we look at and depend upon parliaments the better.
('81', 435, 1, 24, 746969) Power resides in the people either through their arms or through their civil disobedience, more comprehensively described as non violent non co operation.
('81', 435, 1, 25, 747124) But the power of non co operation comes only through solid, incessant constructive work.
('81', 435, 1, 26, 747213) Non violent strength comes from the constructive programme only and not through destructive activi ties.
('81', 435, 1, 27, 747318) Hence the constructive programme is the only thing before the Congress today.
('81', 435, 1, 28, 747396) And in this all parties are at one.
('81', 435, 1, 29, 747432) There are instructions about the constructive programme for Congressmen.
('81', 435, 1, 30, 747505) They form the operative part.
('81', 435, 1, 31, 747535) If properly implemented, this would be a complete substitute for civil disobedience and the parliamentary programme.
('81', 435, 1, 32, 747652) Civil disobedience has been wisely reserved for me as an expert in satyagraha.
('81', 435, 1, 33, 747731) It is good, so long as I am alive and well in mind, that it is so reserved.
('81', 435, 1, 34, 747807) I have almost put a stop to it today.
('81', 435, 1, 35, 747845) But the suspension of satyagraha is not linked with the resolution.
('81', 435, 1, 36, 747913) So far as I am concerned, there will be no need for
('81', 436, 0, 1, 747965) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARTY, 1942 437
('81', 436, 1, 2, 748013) satyagraha, if the Government do not interfere with Harijan.
('81', 436, 1, 3, 748074) For these three weeklies will constitute enough propaganda against all war.
('81', 436, 1, 4, 748150) Harijan will try to carry the message of peace to all corners of the country.
('81', 436, 1, 5, 748228) But if this is not permitted, then will be the time for civil disobedience as a gesture.
('81', 436, 1, 6, 748317) I want every worker to be out for constructive activity.
('81', 436, 1, 7, 748374) Today we have to serve the millions and that work does not allow us to get shut up in prisons.
('81', 436, 1, 8, 748469) We do not wish that thieves and robbers may ransack the country.
('81', 436, 1, 9, 748534) Even if we want to unleash a revolution, we shall have to provide for the prevention of pillage.
('81', 436, 1, 10, 748631) The Congress will disappear if it fails to do this.
('81', 436, 1, 11, 748683) The work of providing adequate food and clothing to the famished devolves on our shoulders.
('81', 436, 1, 12, 748775) But if even the pen is snatched away from my hands, I may be compelled to become the sole resister.
('81', 436, 1, 13, 748875) But I have no fixed plans.
('81', 436, 1, 14, 748902) Events will point the way.
('81', 436, 2, 15, 748929) The suspension of satyagraha has connection only with the present condition of the country, and I want every single man who thinks with me to remain outside and do work rather than go to jail and read the Koran and the Gita and lead an easy life there.
('81', 436, 2, 16, 749182) I wont let them lead an easy life.
('81', 436, 2, 17, 749217) Jawaharlal will ask for diaries from thousands of men.
('81', 436, 2, 18, 749272) He is not going to sleep.
('81', 436, 2, 19, 749298) Therefore, if you will go away with the real message to the country, do not criticize this resolution.
('81', 436, 2, 20, 749401) Nobody is rendered incapable of giving the fullest possible service, in fact he is made capable of the fullest growth, by reason of this resolution.
('81', 436, 2, 21, 749550) Civil disobedience remains under my control, and the reason for its suspension is wholly extraneous to my retirement from office.
('81', 436, 2, 22, 749680) Every one of you has to give a good account of yourself.
('81', 436, 2, 23, 749737) If all will pull your full weight in the fulfilment of the constructive programme, you will find a different India in six months time.

('81', 438, 2, 3, 751461) WARDHAGANJ, January 17, 1942
('81', 438, 3, 4, 751490) Gandhiji explained what had been achieved at Sevagram in regard to the
('81', 438, 4, 5, 751561) restoration of communal unity and removal of untouchability and urged that they were
('81', 438, 5, 6, 751646) assets which should be acquired whether freedom was obtained or not.
('81', 438, 5, 7, 751715) He also pointed
('81', 438, 6, 8, 751731) out what work had been done with regard to khadi and basic education.
('81', 438, 7, 9, 751801) He dealt with the various aspects of the constructive programme, with
('81', 438, 8, 10, 751871) particular reference to Hindu Muslim unity, the removal of untouchability, charkha
('81', 438, 9, 11, 751954) and the organization of a volunteer corps.
('81', 438, 10, 12, 751997) Mahatma Gandhi emphasized that a mere pact between the Congress and the
('81', 438, 11, 13, 752069) Muslim League would not solve the problem; such a pact was applicable only to the
('81', 438, 12, 14, 752151) carrying out of the parliamentary programme.
('81', 438, 12, 15, 752196) He referred to the Lucknow Congress 
('81', 438, 13, 16, 752233) League Pact 2 and said that real Hindu Muslim unity could only be brought about by
('81', 438, 14, 17, 752316) active constructive work.
('81', 438, 15, 18, 752342) Answering a question, Gandhiji said that volunteer bodies must be organized
('81', 438, 16, 19, 752418) but only on the basis of non violence.
('81', 438, 16, 20, 752457) The volunteers must render all help to the
('81', 438, 17, 21, 752500) people.
('81', 438, 17, 22, 752508) It was possible that these organizations might not be allowed to function.
('81', 438, 18, 23, 752583) such circumstances, they must carry on their work, if it was indispensable, even at the
('81', 438, 19, 24, 752671) risk of their lives.
('81', 438, 20, 25, 752692) Everyone who is a four anna member of the Congress must become a Khudai Khidmatgar now by service to the people.
('81', 438, 21, 26, 752805) Concluding, Gandhiji exhorted them to carry out the instructions given by the
('81', 438, 22, 27, 752883) Working Committee carefully, which alone would strengthen them in the struggle for
('81', 438, 23, 28, 752966) freedom.

('81', 439, 2, 3, 753365) [Before January 18, 1942]
('81', 439, 3, 4, 753391) The would be satyagrahi 2 said he was a believer in ahimsa.
('81', 439, 3, 5, 753451) Gandhiji asked him : How much do you spin5 yards or 50 yards?
('81', 439, 4, 6, 753513) Never more than 50, and sometimes even less than 5. Do you spin every day, or once every week, or every month?
('81', 439, 5, 7, 753624) I dont spin more than 50 or 100 yards in a month.
('81', 439, 5, 8, 753674) Do you make your own slivers?
('81', 439, 6, 9, 753704) No, Mahatmaji.
('81', 439, 6, 10, 753719) Then where do you get them from?
('81', 439, 6, 11, 753752) Get them by post?
('81', 439, 7, 12, 753770) No, I get them from the khadi bhandar, and when I do not get them there, I get them through friends coming from places where slivers can be had.
('81', 439, 7, 13, 753915) Do you make you mal (string) yourself or do you purchase a reel from the market?
('81', 439, 8, 14, 753996) His friend intervened and said : Mahatmaji, he is a believer in ahimsa, and that, I thought, was the essential qualification.
('81', 439, 8, 15, 754122) According to the test you now apply we are all likely to fail. Well, then it is better that none of you takes part in satyagraha than that you should go without being properly qualified.
('81', 439, 8, 16, 754309) My standard is inexorable.
('81', 439, 8, 17, 754336) I want you to spin not only regularly but intelligently.
('81', 439, 8, 18, 754393) I want you to know how to test your yarn, how to draw fine yarn and coarse yarn, to know the economics of khadi and so on.
('81', 439, 8, 19, 754516) And when you will say to me, I know all these things, I will ask you : What about you life? Do you observe non violence in your relations with the members of your family and in your daily affairs?
('81', 439, 8, 20, 754713) Where is the good of your saying you accept non violence in theory?
('81', 439, 8, 21, 754781) Supposing you said you accepted the theory of khadi, but purchased and used foreign cloth, how would your acceptance of the theory help me?
('81', 439, 8, 22, 754921) And please understand that, while in British India I am prepared to reconcile myself to belief in ahimsa as a policy, I want you in the States to believe in it as a creed.
('81', 439, 8, 23, 755093) Violence in many Indian States is greater than in British India, and we want the supreme purity and sacrifice of a Prahlada to meet the violence there.
('81', 439, 8, 24, 755245) Give me a Prahlada, and I shall give him my blessings.

('81', 440, 2, 3, 755486) SEVAGRAM, January 18, 1942
('81', 440, 3, 4, 755513) DEAR KHAN SAHEB, Maulana Saheb and Jawaharlal had a long talk with me over your retiring from the Congress.
('81', 440, 3, 5, 755621) They say that they never understood that you had contemplated withdrawal from the Congress.
('81', 440, 3, 6, 755713) They said that the talk was plainly about withdrawal from the Working Committee only.
('81', 440, 3, 7, 755799) They said too that in their opinion your withdrawal even from the W.C. was sure to be misunderstood and would harm the very cause you have at heart.
('81', 440, 3, 8, 755948) Naturally you are the best judge of the situation.
('81', 440, 3, 9, 755999) You would give due weight to their opinion.
('81', 440, 3, 10, 756043) I can have no opinion.
('81', 440, 3, 11, 756066) I rely entirely upon your judgement on the facts.
('81', 440, 3, 12, 756116) If the facts are as they say, their opinion should prevail.
('81', 440, 3, 13, 756176) If they are otherwise and you have no such fear as they entertain, your opinion should prevail.
('81', 440, 3, 14, 756272) They further said that you should take no step without the approval of Dr. Khan Saheb and your co workers.
('81', 440, 3, 15, 756379) They say too that if you go, Dr. K. S. must come to the W.C. You will now tell me and Maulana Saheb what is to be your judgement.
('81', 440, 4, 16, 756509) I hope my letter is clear.

('81', 440, 8, 21, 756644) LILI, I have your letter.
('81', 440, 8, 22, 756670) I have not a single minute to spare.
('81', 440, 8, 23, 756707) It is not proper for you to lose heart.
('81', 440, 8, 24, 756747) You must make up your mind to pass.
('81', 440, 8, 25, 756783) We are going to Kashi today, and shall be back on the 24th.
('81', 440, 9, 26, 756843) Blessings from

('81', 441, 1, 2, 757054) 713. REAL WAR EFFORT The greatest need of the immediate present is to feed the hungry and clothe the naked.
('81', 441, 1, 3, 757162) There is already scarcity in the land both of food and clothing.
('81', 441, 1, 4, 757227) As the war progresses, both the scarcities must increase.
('81', 441, 1, 5, 757285) There are no imports from outside, either of food stuff or of cloth.
('81', 441, 1, 6, 757354) The well to do may not feel the pinch as yet or at all, but the poor are feeling it now.
('81', 441, 1, 7, 757443) The well to do live on the poor.
('81', 441, 1, 8, 757476) There is no other way.
('81', 441, 1, 9, 757499) What is then their duty?
('81', 441, 1, 10, 757524) He who saves gains as much, that is to say, he produces as much.
('81', 441, 1, 11, 757589) Hence those who feel for the poor, those who would be one with them must curtail their wants.
('81', 441, 1, 12, 757683) There are many ways.
('81', 441, 1, 13, 757704) I shall only mention some here.
('81', 441, 1, 14, 757736) There is much, too much food eaten and wasted by the well to do.
('81', 441, 1, 15, 757801) Use one grain at a time.
('81', 441, 1, 16, 757826) Chapati, rice, and pulses, milk, gur, ghee, and oil are used in ordinary households besides vegetables and fruit.
('81', 441, 1, 17, 757940) I regard this as an unhealthy combination.
('81', 441, 1, 18, 757983) Those who get animal protein in the shape of milk, cheese, eggs or meat need not use pulses at all.
('81', 441, 1, 19, 758083) The poor people get only vegetable protein.
('81', 441, 1, 20, 758127) If the well to do give up pulses and oils, they set free these two essentials for the poor who get neither animal protein nor animal fat.
('81', 441, 1, 21, 758265) Then the grain eaten should not be sloppy.
('81', 441, 1, 22, 758308) Half the quantity suffices when it is eaten dry and not dipped in any gravy.
('81', 441, 1, 23, 758385) It is well to eat it with raw salads such as onion, carrot, radish, salad leaves, tomatoes.
('81', 441, 1, 24, 758477) An ounce or two of salads serves the purpose of eight ounces of cooked vegetables.
('81', 441, 1, 25, 758560) Chapatis or bread should not be eaten with milk.
('81', 441, 1, 26, 758609) To begin with, one meal may be raw vegetables and chapati or bread, and the other cooked vegetables with milk or curds.
('81', 441, 1, 27, 758729) Sweet dishes should be eliminated altogether.
('81', 441, 1, 28, 758775) Instead, gur or sugar in small quantities may be taken with milk or bread or by itself.
('81', 441, 1, 29, 758863) Fresh fruit is good to eat, but only a little is necessary to give tone to the system.
('81', 441, 1, 30, 758950) It is an expensive article, and an over indulgence by the well to do has deprived the poor and the ailing of an article which they need much more than the well to do.
('81', 441, 1, 31, 759117) Any medical man who has studied the science of dietetics will certify that what I have suggested can do no harm to the body, on the contrary it must conduce to better health.
('81', 441, 1, 32, 759292) This is only one way of saving food stuff.
('81', 441, 1, 33, 759335) It is obvious.
('81', 441, 1, 34, 759350) But by itself it cannot produce much visible effect.
('81', 441, 1, 35, 759403) Grain dealers have to shed their greed and the habit of making as much profit as possible.
('81', 441, 1, 36, 759494) They must be satisfied with as little as possible.
('81', 441, 1, 37, 759545) They run the risk of being looted, if they do not gain the credit of being keepers of grain for the sake of the poor.
('81', 441, 1, 38, 759663) They should
('81', 442, 0, 1, 759675) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 443
('81', 442, 1, 2, 759722) be in touch with the people in their neighbourhood.
('81', 442, 1, 3, 759774) Congressmen have to visit grain dealers within their beat and give them the message of the time.
('81', 442, 1, 4, 759871) By far the most important part of the work consists in educating the villagers to keep what they have and to induce cultivation of fresh crops wherever water is available.
('81', 442, 1, 5, 760043) This requires widespread and intelligent propaganda.
('81', 442, 1, 6, 760096) It is not generally known that bananas, potatoes, beetroot, yam and suran, and in a measure pumpkin are a food crop easily grown.
('81', 442, 1, 7, 760226) They can take the place of bread in time of need.
('81', 442, 1, 8, 760276) There is, too, scarcity of money.
('81', 442, 1, 9, 760310) There may be grain available but no money to buy it with.
('81', 442, 1, 10, 760368) There is no money because there is no employment.
('81', 442, 1, 11, 760418) This has to be found.
('81', 442, 1, 12, 760440) Spinning is the readiest and the handiest.
('81', 442, 1, 13, 760483) But local needs may supply other sources of labour.
('81', 442, 1, 14, 760535) Every available source has to be tapped so that there is no want of employment.
('81', 442, 1, 15, 760615) Only the lazy ones need and must starve.
('81', 442, 1, 16, 760656) Patient handling will induce even this class to shed their laziness.
('81', 442, 1, 17, 760725) The problem of clothing is much easier than feeding, if it is handled well and in time.
('81', 442, 1, 18, 760813) The mills may not be relied on in these times.
('81', 442, 1, 19, 760860) There is ample cotton to be had in India.
('81', 442, 1, 20, 760902) It is a problem for cotton cultivators how to dispose of their stock.
('81', 442, 1, 21, 760972) The outside market is closed to them.
('81', 442, 1, 22, 761010) Our mills cannot absorb the whole of the crop.
('81', 442, 1, 23, 761057) It can be utilized, if the nation takes to spinning not for wages but for the sake of clothing the naked.
('81', 442, 1, 24, 761163) Of course those who need employment will spin for profit.
('81', 442, 1, 25, 761221) This number must be limited.
('81', 442, 1, 26, 761250) They need organizing.
('81', 442, 1, 27, 761272) Much money will be needed for the purpose.
('81', 442, 1, 28, 761315) But national spinning does not need so much organizing.
('81', 442, 1, 29, 761371) Profit motive being eliminated and willingness being assumed, organization is reduced to simplest terms.
('81', 442, 1, 30, 761476) This is no time for multiplying wheels.
('81', 442, 1, 31, 761516) They take time to manufacture.
('81', 442, 1, 32, 761547) Raw materials are daily becoming dearer.
('81', 442, 1, 33, 761588) Wheels cannot be manufactured everywhere.
('81', 442, 1, 34, 761630) Places where they are can be counted on the fingers of one hand.
('81', 442, 1, 35, 761695) Therefore I suggest the plying of the dhanush takli and even the simple takli.
('81', 442, 1, 36, 761774) The former should be manufactured locally.
('81', 442, 1, 37, 761817) Indeed it is difficult to manufacture the simple takli at once in lacs.
('81', 442, 1, 38, 761889) The dhanush takli is the only thing which can be easiest manufactured.
('81', 442, 1, 39, 761960) Slivers cannot be supplied to spinners.
('81', 442, 1, 40, 762000) Each one should get some cotton for himself or herself, and card it as well as may be with the hand or with a home made small bow such as the children in the Bihar basic schools have.
('81', 442, 1, 41, 762184) All this can be done because no one is expected to manufacture a large quantity of yarn.
('81', 442, 1, 42, 762273) If every one of our available
('81', 443, 0, 1, 762303) 444 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 443, 1, 2, 762345) millions span for one hour daily, there would be enough yarn to keep every handloom going.
('81', 443, 1, 3, 762436) The reader should know that there are lacs of handloom weavers in the land.
('81', 443, 1, 4, 762512) There is danger of their starving for want of yarn.
('81', 443, 1, 5, 762564) Here is a great task for every Congressman to undertake.
('81', 443, 1, 6, 762621) He has to become a good spinner and carder and know how to manufacture the dhanush takli.
('81', 443, 1, 7, 762711) Let every Congressman begin with himself and his family and neighbours, and he will find that the life giving contagion spreads like wild fire which envelops you before you hardly know what you are witnessing.
('81', 443, 1, 8, 762921) Any organization that tackles these two problems successfully will command the love and confidence of the people.
('81', 443, 1, 9, 763035) I hope that all will join in this real war effort.
('81', 443, 1, 10, 763086) It is none the less effective because it is peaceful and constructive.
('81', 443, 1, 11, 763157) Will the Princes let their people do this work without let or hindrance?
('81', 443, 1, 12, 763230) Will Quaid e Azam Jinnah allow the members of the Muslim League to co operate with the Congress workers in this truly national but non political work which is also humanitarian?
('81', 443, 1, 13, 763408) There are 23,000 Muslim spinners, carders and weavers earning their daily bread through the A.I.S.A. ON THE WAY TO KASHI, January 19, 1942 Harijan, 25 1 1942
('81', 443, 2, 14, 763566) 714. CONSTRUCTIVE PROGRAMME AND GOVERNMENT Will not the working of the constructive programme bring Congressmen into conflict with the Government?
('81', 443, 2, 15, 763713) This was one of the many questions asked at the meeting of the principal members of the A. I. C. C. I addressed in Wardha on the 17th.
('81', 443, 2, 16, 763848) My answer was that the whole programme was so conceived as to avoid conflict.
('81', 443, 2, 17, 763926) Of course the most innocent activity may be so manipulated as to provoke conflict.
('81', 443, 2, 18, 764009) I expect every Congress worker to do his best to avoid it.
('81', 443, 2, 19, 764068) But there is no help for it, if the Government prohibit such activities because they are undertaken by Congressmen who believe that the working of the constructive programme will bring swaraj.
('81', 443, 2, 20, 764261) That is the only non violent way to achieve the end.
('81', 443, 2, 21, 764314) Swaraj by non violent means must come from the creative effort of those who desire it.
('81', 443, 2, 22, 764401) The Government should welcome every such effort, unless they want to prevent even cent per cent non violent movement.
('81', 443, 2, 23, 764519) In that case conflict will become unavoidable.
('81', 443, 2, 24, 764566) But I am of opinion that no conflict is possible, at any rate while the war lasts, unless the Congress workers want or provoke it.
('81', 443, 2, 25, 764697) They have to work, work and work.
('81', 443, 2, 26, 764731) They will make no speeches or
('81', 444, 0, 1, 764761) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 445
('81', 444, 1, 2, 764808) demonstrations in doing their constructive work.
('81', 444, 1, 3, 764857) As I have already said, today most of the items of constructive work happen to belike feeding and clothingcommon cause between the Government and the people.
('81', 444, 1, 4, 765015) ON THE WAY TO KASHI, January 19, 1942 Harijan, 25 1 1942 715. COMMUNAL UNITY Freedom will not come through parliamentary effort.
('81', 444, 1, 5, 765144) Therefore communal pacts, whilst they are good if they can be had, are valueless unless they are backed by the union of hearts.
('81', 444, 1, 6, 765272) Without it there can be no peace in the land.
('81', 444, 1, 7, 765318) Even Pakistan can bring no peace, if there is no union of hearts.
('81', 444, 1, 8, 765384) This union can come only by mutual service and co operative work.
('81', 444, 1, 9, 765450) Separate electorates have resulted in the separation of hearts.
('81', 444, 1, 10, 765514) They presupposed mutual distrust and conflict of interests.
('81', 444, 1, 11, 765574) They have tended to perpetuate differences and deepen the distrust.
('81', 444, 1, 12, 765642) How to get out of the tangle is the question.
('81', 444, 1, 13, 765688) I want just now to confine myself to the four Muslim majority provinces.
('81', 444, 1, 14, 765761) In them there is natural Pakistan in the sense that the permanent majority can rule the minority.
('81', 444, 1, 15, 765859) I hold it to be utterly wrong thus to divide man from man by reason of religion which is liable to change.
('81', 444, 1, 16, 765966) What conflict of interest can there be between Hindus and Muslims in the matter of revenue, sanitation, police, justice, or the use of public conveniences?
('81', 444, 1, 17, 766122) The difference can only be in religious usage and observances with which a secular State has no concern.
('81', 444, 1, 18, 766227) Congressmen, if they are not to merge in the Hindus as Hindus, must rigidly abstain from the legislatures and local bodies governed by separate electorates.
('81', 444, 1, 19, 766384) In these provinces the separate electorates must be taken to have come from the Hindu demand and in the supposed Hindu interest.
('81', 444, 1, 20, 766513) But a Congress Hindu has no interest apart from his Muslim brother.
('81', 444, 1, 21, 766581) Therefore he must not enter the electoral bodies where Hindu and Muslim interests are falsely regarded as separate and even antagonistic.
('81', 444, 1, 22, 766719) If he enters these bodies, he can do so only to divide the majority members, i.e., to take sides with one Muslim party or another.
('81', 444, 1, 23, 766850) If I could make all Hindus Congress minded, I would withdraw every Hindu member from these bodies and put the Muslim members on their honour.
('81', 444, 1, 24, 766992) I would seek to influence them from outside these bodies by being friends with them and rendering disinterested service.
('81', 444, 1, 25, 767113) I would be indifferent to their manning all the services.
('81', 444, 1, 26, 767171) At the most an infinitesimal percentage can
('81', 445, 0, 1, 767215) 446 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 445, 1, 2, 767257) have a share in them.
('81', 445, 1, 3, 767279) And it is a superstition to suppose that these services can oppress a people who have become conscious of human dignity and human rights and know how to enforce them.
('81', 445, 1, 4, 767446) Since the vast majority of Congressmen are Hindus in at least three Muslim majority provinces, they have a rare opportunity of showing their non violent strength, their disinterestedness, their utter freedom from the communal taint, and their ability to submit to the rule of their Muslim fellow countrymen.
('81', 445, 1, 5, 767754) They will do this not in a huff but as true nationalists and friends of the Muslims.
('81', 445, 1, 6, 767839) Remaining outside they will probably better protect the just interests of Hindus as citizens.
('81', 445, 1, 7, 767933) For a Congress Hindu is not any the less a Hindu because he claims to represent equally, as he must, all the other faiths in himself.
('81', 445, 1, 8, 768067) For as I have said, so far as the State is concerned, its capacity for service stops short of the service of the different faiths, and the services it can render apply to all irrespective of their faiths.
('81', 445, 1, 9, 768272) Therefore Congressmen have a rare opportunity of showing undefiled nationalism in these provinces.
('81', 445, 1, 10, 768371) They will incidentally show the other minorities that they have nothing to fear from the majorities if they know the true way.
('81', 445, 1, 11, 768498) We must get out of the miasma of religious majorities and minorities.
('81', 445, 1, 12, 768568) Why is a Parsis interest different from a Hindus or Muslims so far as the State is concerned?
('81', 445, 1, 13, 768662) Did not Dadabhai and Pherozeshah rule the Congress while they lived, not by Congress grace or patronage, but by right of service and merit?
('81', 445, 1, 14, 768802) Did their rule injure any Hindu or Muslim interest?
('81', 445, 1, 15, 768854) Were these interests ever in conflict on the Congress platform?
('81', 445, 1, 16, 768918) And is not the Congress a voluntary State?
('81', 445, 1, 17, 768961) ON THE WAY TO KASHI, January 20, 1942 Harijan, 25 1 1942
('81', 445, 2, 18, 769018) 716. QUESTION BOX
('81', 445, 3, 19, 769036) CONGRESS AND A. R. P.
('81', 445, 4, 20, 769058) Q. Can a Congressman belong to A.R.P. and such other committees connected with the war?
('81', 445, 5, 21, 769146) A. I think not.
('81', 445, 5, 22, 769162) But this does not mean that he will render no help in caring for those who may be injured by bombs or otherwise.
('81', 445, 5, 23, 769275) On the contrary he will be expected to be most assiduous in rendering such help.
('81', 445, 6, 24, 769356) ECONOMIC EQUALITY
('81', 445, 7, 25, 769374) Q. While working the constructive programme, can a Congressman preach economic equality?
('81', 445, 7, 26, 769463) How can working the civil disobedience programme bring it about?
('81', 446, 0, 1, 769528) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 447
('81', 446, 1, 2, 769575) A. You can certainly preach it, if your speech is strictly non violent and not in the manner of some who, I know, have preached forcible dispossession of landowners and capitalists.
('81', 446, 1, 3, 769757) But I have shown a better way than preaching.
('81', 446, 1, 4, 769803) The constructive programme takes the country a long way towards the goal.
('81', 446, 1, 5, 769877) This is the most auspicious time for it.
('81', 446, 1, 6, 769918) The charkha and the allied industries, if fully successful, practically abolish all inequalities, both social and economic.
('81', 446, 1, 7, 770042) The rising consciousness of the strength which non violence gives to the people, and their intelligent refusal to co operate in their slavery must bring about equality.
('81', 446, 2, 8, 770211) STRENGTHEN THE ORGANIZATION
('81', 446, 3, 9, 770239) Q. What is the meaning of strengthening the Congress organization?
('81', 446, 4, 10, 770306) A. You can strengthen it no doubt by enlisting members who know the meaning of the fundamental article of the Congress, namely, attainment of Purna Swaraj by peaceful and legitimate means.
('81', 446, 4, 11, 770495) Enlisting of bogus members and members for seizing power in the Congress is vicious and harmful.
('81', 446, 4, 12, 770592) There is no room for power politics within the Congress, if the Congress is to end the power or the system that grinds the people and be itself in power.
('81', 446, 4, 13, 770746) Therefore real strengthening of the organization consists in every Congressman working the constructive programme to its fullest capacity.
('81', 446, 4, 14, 770885) Enlisting bona fide members without much effort provides running expense of the Congress, only if the enlisting itself does not eat up the subscriptions you collect from members.
('81', 446, 4, 15, 771064) OTHER ORGANIZATIONS
('81', 446, 5, 16, 771084) Q. What do you mean by associating with other volunteer organizations working for similar ends?
('81', 446, 5, 17, 771180) Do you include communal organizations?
('81', 446, 6, 18, 771219) A. I do.
('81', 446, 6, 19, 771228) Unfortunately we have very few other non communal organizations.
('81', 446, 6, 20, 771293) Similar ends naturally means constructive ends, using constructive in the widest sense of the term.
('81', 446, 6, 21, 771393) Thus you will tender your help to a Muslim League or Hindu Sabha volunteer in putting out fire or tending the wounded.
('81', 446, 6, 22, 771512) You will also invite their help in such matters.

('81', 447, 2, 3, 771715) January 21, 1942
('81', 447, 3, 4, 771732) REVERED MALAVIYAJI, SIR RADHAKRISHNAN, BROTHERS AND SISTERS, You all know very well that I have neither the physical strength nor the inclination to undertake a long journey, and yet when I received Sir Radhakrishnans invitation to deliver an address on the occasion of the Silver Jubilee Convocation of the Benares Hindu University I had not the heart to decline it.
('81', 447, 3, 5, 772100) You know the strong bond of affection that binds me to Malaviyaji, and it is with a certain amount of pride and satisfaction that I obey his behest whenever it is at all possible for me.
('81', 447, 3, 6, 772287) I therefore could not say no, Sir Radhakrishnans letter was a call to a pilgrimage.
('81', 447, 3, 7, 772371) Great as are Malaviyajis services to the country, I have no doubt that this University constitutes his greatest service and achievement, and he has worn himself out for the work that is dear to him as life itself.
('81', 447, 3, 8, 772585) It was out of my great regard for him that twenty five years ago I accepted his invitation to attend the foundation ceremony of this University.
('81', 447, 3, 9, 772730) 2 I knew that in that august function, which was to be attended by the Viceroy and the ruling Princes of India, there was no place for a poor man like me.
('81', 447, 3, 10, 772885) I had not then been made a Mahatma, and if anyone called me by that name, I knew I must have been mistaken for Mahatma Munshiramji, as the late Swami Shraddhanand was then called.
('81', 447, 3, 11, 773065) For there cannot be a number of Mahatmas, and I knew even when I was in South Africa that Munshiramjis great work had entitled him to that name.
('81', 447, 3, 12, 773210) He also was one of those who sent me messages of congratulations and compassion.
('81', 447, 3, 13, 773291) In those days too Malaviyaji Maharaj showered his kindness on me.
('81', 447, 3, 14, 773357) But he has a knack for detecting servants of the people, however obscure they may be, and bringing them into his fold.
('81', 447, 3, 15, 773476) This is his usual trick.
('81', 447, 3, 16, 773501) People have great admiration for Malaviyaji Maharaj as you must have heard today.
('81', 447, 3, 17, 773583) He deserves every word of it.
('81', 447, 3, 18, 773613) I know the Hindu University is a huge affair.
('81', 447, 3, 19, 773659) There is no greater beggar than Malaviyaji on the face of the earth.
('81', 447, 3, 20, 773728) He has never begged for himself; by the grace of God he has never been in want, but he became a voluntary beggar for causes he has made his own, and God has always filled his bowl in an overflowing measure.
('81', 447, 3, 21, 773935) But he has an insatiable
('81', 447, 4, 22, 773960) 1 This has been collated with Mahadev Desais translation in Harijan, 1 2 1942, under the title Kashi Vishwavidyalaya Address.

('81', 448, 0, 1, 774139) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 449
('81', 448, 1, 2, 774186) appetite, and although he got a crore and ten lacs instead of the crore he wanted he is still asking for more.
('81', 448, 1, 3, 774297) Even at this moment he whispered into my ears that he had a good donation from the Maharaja of Darbhanga, our Chairman.
('81', 448, 1, 4, 774417) I know how Malaviyaji leads his own life.
('81', 448, 1, 5, 774459) It has been my privilege to be acquainted with every aspect of his life.
('81', 448, 1, 6, 774532) It is a rare good fortune to have him still in our midst, a living example of a pure life of plain living and high thinking; the students particularly can draw many a lesson from his life but I have a fear that, though he is physically in your midst, many of you are untouched by his great example.
('81', 448, 1, 7, 774831) The fault is wholly ours, not his.
('81', 448, 1, 8, 774866) The sun radiates heat and light to all on earth, but how can even the sun help those who will shut themselves from him?
('81', 448, 1, 9, 774986) But I am not here to sing Malaviyajis praises.
('81', 448, 1, 10, 775033) Who can be more unfortunate than the one who in spite of being so near to him fails to imbibe his noble qualities such as his simplicity, sacrifice, patriotism, generosity and universal love?
('81', 448, 1, 11, 775225) I must now address a few words to youthe teachers and the students of the Vidyapith.
('81', 448, 1, 12, 775310) When I accepted Sir Radhakrishnans invitation he had asked me to send a copy of my address to him.
('81', 448, 1, 13, 775409) I told him that I had no time to write anything, I did not even know what I should be able to say.
('81', 448, 1, 14, 775508) A feeling of nervousness overpowers me when I am in the midst of learned men.
('81', 448, 1, 15, 775586) Ever since my return to India my lot has been cast among the poor and the downtroddenthose whom the Congress representsand whilst in their midst I feel no sense of constraint or hesitation.
('81', 448, 1, 16, 775776) In your midst I feel tongue tied.
('81', 448, 1, 17, 775810) I simply said to Sir Radhakrishnan that I should trust to the inspiration of the moment.
('81', 448, 1, 18, 775899) That inspiration has come, but I do not know how you will welcome my plain speaking.
('81', 448, 1, 19, 775984) As speaker after speaker spoke and left the dais, I longed for someone who would address the audience in Hindi or Urdu, or Hindustani, aye, even in Sanskrit,even in Marathi, or for that matter in any of the Indian languages.
('81', 448, 1, 20, 776209) But no such good luck befell me and you.
('81', 448, 1, 21, 776250) We are slaves and have hugged the language of those who have kept us enslaved.
('81', 448, 1, 22, 776329) It has become a fashion to blame the Englishmen for all our ills.
('81', 448, 1, 23, 776395) I have not hesitated to blame them for many things they have done.
('81', 448, 1, 24, 776462) I have never charged them with compelling us to adopt English as the medium of expression.
('81', 448, 1, 25, 776553) We devote precious years of our lives to learning the English language, our ambition being to be able to speak English as Englishmen, and our breast swells with pride when an Englishman pats us on our back for speaking flawless English.
('81', 448, 1, 26, 776790) Think of the time and energy of our youth expended on learning the English language, as if it was our mother tongue, and calculate by simple multiplication the number of
('81', 449, 0, 1, 776960) 450 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 449, 1, 2, 777002) years and the volume of precious energy that are lost to the nation.
('81', 449, 1, 3, 777071) And yet all this is happening in the Benares Hindu University which has been extolled today as the living embodiment of Indian culture.
('81', 449, 1, 4, 777207) Malaviyaji did all that was necessary to draw the best possible teachers by attractive salaries, but he could not do the rest.
('81', 449, 1, 5, 777334) It was not his fault that Hindi did not take the place of English.
('81', 449, 1, 6, 777401) The teachers are the product of the tradition which they have inherited, and the students are content to accept what they get from them.
('81', 449, 1, 7, 777538) They need not be.
('81', 449, 1, 8, 777556) They go on strikes and even hunger strikes, often for trivial reasons.
('81', 449, 1, 9, 777627) Why will they not insist on having their tuition in the all India language?
('81', 449, 1, 10, 777703) There are, we were told today, 250 students here from the Andhra Province.
('81', 449, 1, 11, 777778) Let them go to Sir Radhakrishnan and ask for an Andhra section of the University and ask to be taught through the medium of Telugu if they will not learn the all India language.
('81', 449, 1, 12, 777956) But if they were to be guided by my lights, being Indians they should demand as the medium of instruction a language understood throughout India.
('81', 449, 1, 13, 778102) And Hindustani alone can be that language.
('81', 449, 1, 14, 778145) You know what has happened in Japana country which I do not regard as essentially greatbut which is regarded as great in Asia in that it has successfully challenged the supremacy of America and England.
('81', 449, 1, 15, 778348) The thouands of boys and girls in the Japanese schools and colleges receive their education not through the medium of English but through Japanese.
('81', 449, 1, 16, 778496) Their script is difficult, but it is no bar to their learning it and they have not given it up in preference to the Roman.
('81', 449, 1, 17, 778619) Not that they boycott English and other European language.
('81', 449, 1, 18, 778678) But they economize their energy.
('81', 449, 1, 19, 778711) Those who need to learn them do so for enriching the Japanese thought with knowledge which the West alone can give.
('81', 449, 1, 20, 778827) They take care to turn into Japanese all that is worth taking from the West.
('81', 449, 1, 21, 778904) That is because the mind of Japans youth is fresh and alert.
('81', 449, 1, 22, 778965) The knowledge gained thus has become national property.
('81', 449, 1, 23, 779021) There would have been no greater folly if instead of doing so they had thrown their mother tongue to the winds and opened English medium schools and colleges such as we find in other countries.
('81', 449, 1, 24, 779215) In this way they might well have learnt a new language but the Japanese people could not have gained the new knowledge.
('81', 449, 1, 25, 779335) Our ambition does not go beyond becoming clerks in Government offices, lawyers, barristers, judges, all helplessly serving the system they would fain destroy.
('81', 449, 1, 26, 779494) And we have not succeeded in mastering the English language either.
('81', 449, 1, 27, 779562) After all, is it not an alien language?
('81', 449, 1, 28, 779602) I get numerous letters from English educated peoplesome of them possessing the highest degrees of our universitiesbut they betray a woeful ignorance of the English language.
('81', 449, 1, 29, 779776) The reason is simple.
('81', 449, 1, 30, 779798) Malaviyajis and Radhakrishnans are rare, and the thousands cannot achieve what
('81', 450, 0, 1, 779877) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 451
('81', 450, 1, 2, 779924) they have done.
('81', 450, 1, 3, 779940) As I was listening to the English speeches I was amazed at the patience and innate courtesy of our people who, though they do not understand a word of what is said, do not mob us, as they well might do.
('81', 450, 1, 4, 780143) If there is any doubt in your minds about this, I can demonstrate to you by a show of hands how feweven from among the students have followed the proceedings here.
('81', 450, 1, 5, 780307) I had said all this when I came here twenty five years ago.
('81', 450, 1, 6, 780367) What I have seen today compels me to repeat it all.
('81', 450, 1, 7, 780419) There is another thing to which I am tempted to draw your attention.
('81', 450, 1, 8, 780488) I witnessed this morning a scene that I had least expected here.
('81', 450, 1, 9, 780553) There was a Vasant Panchami day 1 procession of the students who had to march past Malaviyajis house after receiving his silent blessings.
('81', 450, 1, 10, 780692) The way in which they were walking betrayed a lack of even elementary physical training.
('81', 450, 1, 11, 780781) Instead of walking in step, erect and disciplined like soldiers on the march, they walked haphazardly in a desultory fashion.
('81', 450, 1, 12, 780907) Their walking could hardly be called a march.
('81', 450, 1, 13, 780953) In my opinion they are so much burdened with English that they find no time to attend to other things.
('81', 450, 1, 14, 781056) That is why they are unable to learn the things they must.
('81', 450, 1, 15, 781115) I noticed another thing while returning after a visit to Shri Shivprasad Gupta in the morning.
('81', 450, 1, 16, 781210) I cannot help saying a word about the sight that greets you as you enter the great portals of the University.
('81', 450, 1, 17, 781320) Thanks to the money that Malaviyaji can get for the asking, the gate is in consonance with the splendour of the edifices here.
('81', 450, 1, 18, 781447) But what did I find on the top of the gate?the bulk of the space (three fourths) taken up by the words BENARES HINDU UNIVERSITY in English, and one fourth given to the inscription in Hindi which is the language through which you would derive your knowledge.
('81', 450, 1, 19, 781705) I wondered what need there was of the English language?
('81', 450, 1, 20, 781761) Malaviyaji cannot be blamed for this.
('81', 450, 1, 21, 781799) It must have been the work of some engineer.
('81', 450, 1, 22, 781844) Just a little thought on the part of those who were in charge of such things would have been enough to tell them that what was needed there was the name written in Devanagari and Persian scripts which would have symbolized to the people the desire on the part of Malaviyajis University and Sir Radhakrishnan for communal harmony.
('81', 450, 1, 23, 782174) It would have been in the fitness of things too, as both Hindi and Urdu are understood in this region and both the scripts are familiar.
('81', 450, 1, 24, 782311) The fact that it is written in English is an indication of the domination of the English language over our minds.
('81', 450, 1, 25, 782425) We are scared of learning a new language or a script, whereas
('81', 450, 2, 26, 782487) 1 On which the Goddess of Learning is worshipped
('81', 451, 0, 1, 782536) 452 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 451, 1, 2, 782578) for us learning an Indian language or a script should be as easy as anything.
('81', 451, 1, 3, 782656) Surely it is no difficult thing for a non Hindi speaking person to learn Hindi or Hindustani.
('81', 451, 1, 4, 782750) I can undertake to teach Hindi to anyone knowing Gujarati, Bengali or Marathi in the space of three months.
('81', 451, 1, 5, 782858) Even the South Indian languagesTamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannadaare full of Sanskrit words and, if there was just a little fervour and love of the country in us, we should not hesitate to decide to write all the languages derived from Sanskrit as also the Southern group in the Devanagari script.
('81', 451, 1, 6, 783155) These languages have not only a fairly common vocabulary, there is also a striking resemblance in the scripts.
('81', 451, 1, 7, 783266) If our minds were not fagged, we would easily know half a dozen Indian languages.
('81', 451, 1, 8, 783348) Then there is Urdu which should not be difficult to learn, if only our Urdu scholars did not make it a matter of pride to pack it with Persian and Arabic words, as the pundits pack Hindi with Sanskrit words.
('81', 451, 1, 9, 783556) The result is that I am completely at a loss when high flown Urdu of the Lucknow style is flung at me.
('81', 451, 1, 10, 783659) One more thought I should like to leave with you.
('81', 451, 1, 11, 783709) Every university is supposed to have its tradition, its distinctive feature Oxford and Cambridge, for instance, have theirs.
('81', 451, 1, 12, 783834) They take pride in the fact that the students they turn out can at once be identified for the distinctive impression left on them by the universities.
('81', 451, 1, 13, 783985) Our universities leave no such distinctive mark.
('81', 451, 1, 14, 784034) But I am afraid our universities are the blotting sheets of the West.
('81', 451, 1, 15, 784104) We have borrowed the superficial features of the Western universities, and flattered ourselves that we have founded living universities here.
('81', 451, 1, 16, 784246) Do they reflect or respond to the needs of the masses?
('81', 451, 1, 17, 784301) Now I am told that a special feature of your University is that engineering and technology are taught here as nowhere else.
('81', 451, 1, 18, 784425) I should not consider this a distinguishing feature.
('81', 451, 1, 19, 784478) Let me make a suggestion to you.
('81', 451, 1, 20, 784511) Have you been able to attract to your University youths from Aligarh?
('81', 451, 1, 21, 784581) Have you been able to identify yourselves with them?
('81', 451, 1, 22, 784634) That, I think, should be your special work, the special contribution of your University.
('81', 451, 1, 23, 784723) Money has come in, and more will come in if God keeps Malaviyaji in our midst for a few more years.
('81', 451, 1, 24, 784823) But no amount of money will achieve the miracle I wantI mean a heart unity between Hindus and Muslims.
('81', 451, 1, 25, 784926) I would like you to go out to invite Mussalmans to come here, and not to mind if they reject your advances.
('81', 451, 1, 26, 785034) You are the representatives of a great civilization which according to Lokamanya Tilak is 10,000 years old and according to later scholars even older.
('81', 451, 1, 27, 785185) This civilization regards ahimsa as the supreme dharma.
('81', 451, 1, 28, 785241) This has been our tradition from the times of the Vedas.
('81', 451, 1, 29, 785298) The special contribution of that civilization is to befriend the world, to turn so called foes into friends.
('81', 451, 1, 30, 785407) Our civilization has absorbed, like the holy Ganga, many streams from outside, and it
('81', 452, 0, 1, 785493) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 453
('81', 452, 1, 2, 785540) is my prayer that the Hindu University which is endeavouring to represent Hindu culture and Hindu civilization may invite and absorb all that is best in other cultures and nurse hostility towards none.
('81', 452, 1, 3, 785742) That should be its distinctive feature.
('81', 452, 1, 4, 785782) English will not help you to evolve this.
('81', 452, 1, 5, 785824) It is our own ancient learning that will teach you thisour scriptures learnt and understood in the proper spirit.
('81', 452, 1, 6, 785938) One thing more and I have done.
('81', 452, 1, 7, 785970) You are living in palatial hostels, but you should not get used to living in palaces.
('81', 452, 1, 8, 786056) Look at the little house in which Panditji lives in utter simplicity and without the least splendour.
('81', 452, 1, 9, 786158) You enter his room.
('81', 452, 1, 10, 786178) There is no decoration and only the barest furniture.
('81', 452, 1, 11, 786232) You, who will be his heirs, should model your lives accordingly.
('81', 452, 1, 12, 786297) Many of you are children of poor parents.
('81', 452, 1, 13, 786339) Dont forget that you have to represent the poor, and that therefore a life of ease and luxury is inconsistent with the poverty of our land.
('81', 452, 1, 14, 786479) May you be all models of plain and simple living and high thinking like Malaviyaji.
('81', 452, 1, 15, 786563) May God bless you with long life and the wisdom to carry out what I have said, if it has appealed to you.

('81', 452, 4, 19, 786779) BENARES, January 22, 1942
('81', 452, 5, 20, 786805) Q. What is your ultimate object?
('81', 452, 5, 21, 786838) Do you want the Congress to accept your principles or to achieve its object?
('81', 452, 6, 22, 786915) A. Every plan and programme that I have placed before the Congress has been placed with a view to achieving the goal of independence.
('81', 452, 6, 23, 787049) Truth and non violence are a matter of creed for me you may call it my religion, but it has not been my object to propagate that religion through the Congress.
('81', 452, 6, 24, 787209) Before the Congress they have been placed as effective means to an endas political means for a political objective, as I did in South Africa.
('81', 452, 6, 25, 787351) If it was otherwise, I should cease to be a political worker and occupy the position of a dharmaguru 2. The political method can be changed whenever expedient, but the change should be honest and deliberate.
('81', 452, 6, 26, 787559) But one should not pretend to adhere to the method when really in practice one has given it up.
('81', 452, 6, 27, 787655) That would be deceiving oneself and the

('81', 453, 2, 2, 787955) Q. We should like to have a glimpse of the next six months of a year as you picture it to yourself.
('81', 453, 2, 3, 788055) You have often said that this is a fight to the finish, your last fight which will not end until the goal is won.
('81', 453, 2, 4, 788169) What are likely to be the future developments as you can visualize them?
('81', 453, 3, 5, 788242) A. It is a good question, and also a difficult question.
('81', 453, 3, 6, 788299) Not that I am not clear, but because it takes us into the realm of speculation.
('81', 453, 3, 7, 788379) I let things and happenings react on methough I confess I do not follow everything as Jawaharlal with his study of foreign affairs can.
('81', 453, 3, 8, 788515) Jawaharlal is convinced that the British Empire is finished.
('81', 453, 3, 9, 788576) We all wish that it may be finished, but I do not think it is finished.
('81', 453, 3, 10, 788648) We know that the Britishers are tough fighters, we know what the Empireespecially Indiameans to every home in Britain, and therefore they will never consent to be Little Englanders.
('81', 453, 3, 11, 788830) Mr. Churchill has said that they are not sugar candies, and that they can meet rough with rough.
('81', 453, 3, 12, 788927) Therefore it will be long before the Empire is finished.
('81', 453, 3, 13, 788984) There is no doubt, however, that they are nearing the end, and what Jawaharlal has said is very true that, if we could do nothing to prevent the war, we certainly will do much to prevent a peace in which we have no voice.
('81', 453, 3, 14, 789206) That is what every Congressman has to bear in mind.
('81', 453, 3, 15, 789258) We have, therefore, to be up and doing.
('81', 453, 3, 16, 789298) If we sit with folded hands, we may have a peace which we do not desire.
('81', 453, 3, 17, 789371) I adhere to the statement that it is my final fight, but we have had to alter our programme because of the latest developments, because war has come to our door.
('81', 453, 3, 18, 789533) The suspension had nothing to do with my retirement from the official leadership of the Congress.
('81', 453, 3, 19, 789631) Even if it had continued, how could I today ask Jawaharlal to march back to jail?
('81', 453, 3, 20, 789713) Of course he will be in jail, if he is prevented from doing the work we have chalked out.
('81', 453, 3, 21, 789803) But things have happened so rapidly that we had not the slightest idea of what was coming.
('81', 453, 3, 22, 789894) How then can I talk of a year or even six months ahead?
('81', 453, 3, 23, 789950) That we are marching swiftly towards independence I have no doubt.
('81', 453, 3, 24, 790017) There is no doubt about the programme ahead of us.
('81', 453, 3, 25, 790068) No Congressman should rest content with just paying his four anna fee.
('81', 453, 3, 26, 790139) He has to be active all the twenty four hours.
('81', 453, 3, 27, 790186) Even the one concrete programme of production of cloth is sufficient to occupy all our energies.
('81', 453, 3, 28, 790283) There are 4,000 students in the Benares Hindu University.
('81', 453, 3, 29, 790341) Will they spin an hour every day?
('81', 453, 3, 30, 790375) I am talking of spinning because it is a thing nearest my heart, but there are a hundred and one other things.
('81', 453, 3, 31, 790486) Have the villagers enough food to eat?
('81', 453, 3, 32, 790525) Have they enough to cover themselves in this bitter cold?
('81', 453, 3, 33, 790583) These are the questions that occur to me again and again.
('81', 453, 3, 34, 790641) On our capacity to feed the starving and clothe the naked and generally to serve the masses in the time of their need will depend our capacity to influence

('81', 454, 1, 2, 790844) the peace whenever it comes.
('81', 454, 1, 3, 790873) What I have said applies to all parties.
('81', 454, 1, 4, 790914) Whoever serves the purpose best will survive and have an effective voice.
('81', 454, 2, 5, 790988) Q. You think they cannot have a treaty just as they like?
('81', 454, 3, 6, 791046) A. I do.
('81', 454, 3, 7, 791055) The days of secret treaties are gone, I hope.
('81', 454, 3, 8, 791101) If we behave ourselves, we can have a decisive voice at least so far as we are concerned.
('81', 454, 3, 9, 791191) But Jawaharlal can explain these things better.
('81', 454, 3, 10, 791239) I am no student of history or even of contemporary events in the world.
('81', 454, 4, 11, 791311) Q. Why did you advise the A.I.C.C. members to support the Bardoli Resolution, though at one stage you had decided to divide the house?
('81', 454, 4, 12, 791446) Rajajis speeches after the A.I.C.C. are against the Bombay Resolution, and even expediency dictates that there can be no co operating with a dying Empire.
('81', 454, 4, 13, 791601) A. I am afraid you are estopped from asking the question, if I may use a legal term.
('81', 454, 4, 14, 791686) But as you have asked the question, and there is nothing to hide, I may answer it.
('81', 454, 4, 15, 791769) In fact I answered it in my speech before the A. I. C. C., 1 if you listened to it with attention.
('81', 454, 4, 16, 791868) Well, then, let me tell you that, though I am old in age, my mind is not decaying.
('81', 454, 4, 17, 791951) It is ever growing, and the decision not to divide the house indicates my growth or evolution in my own non violence.
('81', 454, 5, 18, 792069) Mahatma Gandhi said that after he had made his attitude on the question known since the Bardoli decision, he had come to realize that as the majority of the Working Committee members, representing, as they do, the large bulk of Congressmen, were not prepared to go the whole hog with him on the question of non violence, it would have become unfair to clinch the issue at Wardha, for he was confident that if he had insisted upon the question being decided by a vote, a large number of the A.I.C.C. members, perhaps in spite of their conscience, would have voted in support of his attitude.
('81', 454, 5, 19, 792660) That could have been a decision obviously misrepresenting the real situation.
('81', 454, 5, 20, 792738) It would have been harmful in the extreme, and hence he decided that he should plead for the support of the Working Committees resolution.
('81', 454, 5, 21, 792877) Wrong assumptions could never lead to right results.
('81', 454, 6, 22, 792930) To divide the house appeared to me a piece of violence.
('81', 454, 6, 23, 792986) If every one of the members of the A. I. C. C. was a pukka believer in political non violence, it would have been a different matter.
('81', 454, 6, 24, 793120) But I knew that such was not the case.
('81', 454, 6, 25, 793159) The Bardoli Resolution was a true reflection of the Congress mind.
('81', 454, 6, 26, 793226) In such matters majority and minority do not count.
('81', 454, 6, 27, 793278) And there was nothing to prevent the whole hoggers to go whatever length they liked.
('81', 454, 6, 28, 793363) The contingency of co operation is, if anything, very remote.

('81', 455, 0, 1, 793557) 456 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 455, 1, 2, 793599) Until then all have to act in terms of non violence.
('81', 455, 1, 3, 793652) When the contingency does arise the whole hoggers can secede from the Congress.
('81', 455, 1, 4, 793732) In fact we can then meet again and put the whole matter to vote.
('81', 455, 2, 5, 793797) Q. Would it be proper or improper to defend oneself with arms against atatayis (confirmed offenders) in case of disturbances?
('81', 455, 3, 6, 793923) A. The answer has been already given by me and also by the Congress.
('81', 455, 3, 7, 793992) And the word atatayi is bad for our purpose.
('81', 455, 3, 8, 794037) And dont ask what is proper and improper.
('81', 455, 3, 9, 794079) If you were to ask me, I should say it is improper.
('81', 455, 3, 10, 794131) If you are non violent, do not have resort to arms.
('81', 455, 3, 11, 794183) If you cannot muster non violence of the brave, defend yourself as best [as] you can.
('81', 455, 3, 12, 794269) The law gives everyone the right of self defence against a dacoit, and the Congress does not take away the legal right.
('81', 455, 3, 13, 794389) But in riots or communal disturbances, he who calls himself a Congressman has to act non violently.
('81', 455, 3, 14, 794489) That is the resolution of the Congress.
('81', 455, 3, 15, 794529) Even there if your courage fails you and you use force, the Congress will not censure you, for the simple reason that the Congress never intended to encourage cowardice.
('81', 455, 4, 16, 794699) Q. You are said to have permitted khadi bhandars to sell blankets to Government.
('81', 455, 4, 17, 794780) It is not co operation in the war effort?
('81', 455, 5, 18, 794822) A. I did.
('81', 455, 5, 19, 794832) It was not proper for me to ask whether the blankets were for the use of soldiers or for someone else.
('81', 455, 5, 20, 794935) The case is different when a man sells fire arms or swords or poison.
('81', 455, 5, 21, 795005) The vendor has to inquire how the fire arms are to be used, and the chemist has to ask for the doctors certificate.
('81', 455, 5, 22, 795121) On the other hand a rice seller will not, and is under no obligation to inquire who is going to consume the rice.
('81', 455, 6, 23, 795235) Admitting that it was very difficult to draw the line of demarcation, Mahatma Gandhi said the principal criterion from his point of view was for the supplier to consider how his supply would be utilized.
('81', 455, 6, 24, 795439) Of course, his view on the question was not necessarily that of the Congress and Congressmen were free to object to it without acquiescing in the butchery in which the soldiers were engaged.
('81', 455, 6, 25, 795630) It was quite conceivable that the blankets supplied to them served to spare them the hardships of a severe winter, the more so when they were maimed or wounded in the battle.
('81', 455, 6, 26, 795805) There was the underlying humanitarian motive in making these supplies and that could not be questioned as co operation in the war effort.
('81', 455, 6, 27, 795943) But you may go further than I did.
('81', 455, 6, 28, 795978) If you think I erred, you are at liberty to denounce me.
('81', 455, 6, 29, 796035) If you think a non violent man may not sell rice or blankets to soldiers, you are welcome to your interpretation of non violence.
('81', 455, 6, 30, 796165) I for one will not hesitate to give water or food to a

('81', 456, 1, 3, 796370) My humanity would not let me do otherwise.
('81', 456, 2, 4, 796413) The question of spurious khadi was next discussed, and Gandhiji said : A great deal depends on intelligent and wide awake public opinion.
('81', 456, 2, 5, 796551) If the public takes it into its mind to prevent the spread of this khadi, it can easily do so.
('81', 456, 2, 6, 796646) But we have not cultivated what Lord Willingdon used to call the courage to say No.
('81', 456, 2, 7, 796730) Those who are interested in khadi are all shareholders of the A. I. S. A., and it is their duty to take up this work.
('81', 456, 2, 8, 796848) To feed the hungry and clothe the naked is our immediate programme, and you have all to lend a hand effectively.
('81', 456, 2, 9, 796961) If you all do so, the question of spurious khadi will not arise.
('81', 456, 2, 10, 797026) No Congressman can deal in spurious khadi.
('81', 456, 3, 11, 797069) Stressing the importance of Congressmen concentrating on khadi, Mahatma Gandhi said that by virtue of their commitment to the Congress constructive programme whereof the khadi movement was the most important part, the responsibility of clothing Indians in the immediate future was devolving upon the shoulders of Congressmen and they would soon be tested as to their ability to discharge it.
('81', 456, 3, 12, 797461) Inquiries made by him from Indian millowners had revealed that cloth stocks were very limited and fast diminishing.
('81', 456, 3, 13, 797577) And such of them as were held were being manipulated by persons dealing in futures (satta).
('81', 456, 3, 14, 797669) Not only the public, said Mahatma Gandhi, but also the Government of the country would knock at his doors for more and ever more of khadi in the near future.
('81', 456, 3, 15, 797827) That time was fast approaching.
('81', 456, 3, 16, 797859) He hoped that Congressmen would not be found unprepared to meet the situation.
('81', 456, 4, 17, 797938) The last question was about the Congressmens duty in times of raids and scares and consequent disturbances.
('81', 456, 4, 18, 798046) The emergency is there today.
('81', 456, 4, 19, 798076) Dacoities are rampant, and unless the Congress asserts itself effectively, the situation will go out of our hands.
('81', 456, 4, 20, 798191) The need for peace brigades was never more urgent than now.
('81', 456, 4, 21, 798251) 2 The risk of death is there, whether you choose violence or non violence.
('81', 456, 4, 22, 798326) Why not then prepare yourselves to die non violently?
('81', 456, 4, 23, 798380) It will also enable you to offer effective resistance in case of a civil war.
('81', 456, 4, 24, 798458) As for the protection of the wounded in air raids, the bulk of the work will come upon yourselves.
('81', 456, 4, 25, 798557) You will not join the A. R. P., simply because you will be then parts of a machine over which you have no control and you would be active participants in the war effort 3. But it

('81', 456, 5, 27, 798787) 2 National Herald add here : In this connection he said that the danger, far from lying in the future, was ever present and, saying that his suggestion for the formation of peace brigades still held the field, he complained that Congressmen had doubted his seriousness in making it and had dismissed it as impracticable without earnestly examining its implications and potentialities. 3 National Herald adds here : in regard to which the Congress position had been already made clear.

('81', 457, 1, 2, 799314) is certain that the Government will not be able to render assistance everywhere.
('81', 457, 1, 3, 799395) Did they do so in Rangoon?
('81', 457, 1, 4, 799422) We have harrowing tales of the dead and wounded lying on the streets of Rangoon uncared for.
('81', 457, 1, 5, 799515) Wherever, therefore, the authorities fail there will be enough scope of work for us.
('81', 457, 1, 6, 799600) We have to prepare
('81', 457, 2, 7, 799619) volunteers for this work ready to take risks and to act with initiative.
('81', 457, 2, 8, 799692) We may have to remove the dead and wounded, take charge of vacant houses, and so on.
('81', 457, 2, 9, 799777) In this work you will heartily co operate with the authorities wherever they will accept your co operation.
('81', 457, 3, 10, 799885) Mahatma Gandhi said that .
('81', 457, 3, 11, 799912) nothing was expected to deter them from organizing volunteer squads and offering such relief as was possible in emergencies in co operation with the Government organization, if necessary, and in spite of it, if possible, regardless of the consequences.
('81', 457, 3, 12, 800165) For instance, after an air raid if there were persons trapped in a crumbling house or a house on fire, it was the duty of Congressmen to extricate them and pull down the house, lest it should collapse and take a toll of life, without waiting to see whether the official organizations aid, sanction or a request for co operation was forthcoming.
('81', 457, 4, 13, 800510) Mahatma Gandhi was all humour at the conference and Acharya J. B. Kripalani, General Secretary of the Congress, was the butt of it.
('81', 457, 4, 14, 800642) Mahatma Gandhi said : Kripalani was morose formerly, because I thought he was not married.
('81', 457, 4, 15, 800733) But, even when he is married and has a very good partner in life, his mood haunts him.

('81', 457, 9, 23, 801431) It is a sad reflection.
('81', 457, 9, 24, 801455) The fault is Congressmens.
('81', 457, 9, 25, 801482) They will not take the trouble of learning Hindustani.
('81', 457, 9, 26, 801537) Their effort for learning languages is evidently exhausted with the performance of the impossible task of acquiring a knowledge of the English language equal to a learned Englishmans.
('81', 457, 9, 27, 801721) The result is tragic.
('81', 457, 9, 28, 801743) It has meant

('81', 458, 0, 1, 801796) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 459
('81', 458, 1, 2, 801843) impoverishment of the provincial languages and displacement of the all India language described by the Congress as Hindustani.
('81', 458, 1, 3, 801970) It has also meant a break between the millions and the English educated few who happen to be the natural leaders for the simple reason that they are the only educated class.
('81', 458, 1, 4, 802144) There is no education worth the name apart from the schools established by the Government.
('81', 458, 1, 5, 802235) The Congress has to perform the Herculean task of dissplacing the English language with Hindustani.
('81', 458, 1, 6, 802335) With the passing of the resolution it should have created a bureau for fulfilling, the purpose as it might do even now.
('81', 458, 1, 7, 802455) But if it does not, individual Congressmen and those who are interested in evolving an all India language should do so.
('81', 458, 1, 8, 802575) But what is Hindustani?
('81', 458, 1, 9, 802599) There is no such language apart from Urdu and Hindi.
('81', 458, 1, 10, 802652) Urdu has sometimes been called Hindustani.
('81', 458, 1, 11, 802695) Did the Congress mean Urdu in the Article quoted?
('81', 458, 1, 12, 802745) Did it exclude the more extensively known Hindi?
('81', 458, 1, 13, 802794) Such a meaning would be absurd.
('81', 458, 1, 14, 802826) It evidently meant, and could only mean, a scientific blend of Hindi and Urdu.
('81', 458, 1, 15, 802905) There is no such written blend extant.
('81', 458, 1, 16, 802944) But it is the common speech of the unlettered millions of Hindus and Muslims living in Northern India.
('81', 458, 1, 17, 803047) Not being written, it is imperfect, and he written language has taken two different turns tending to widen the difference by each running away from the other.
('81', 458, 1, 18, 803206) Therefore the word Hindustani means Hindi and Urdu.
('81', 458, 1, 19, 803258) Therefore also Hindi can call itself Hindustani, if it does not exclude Urdu but tries to assimilate Urdu as much as is scientifically possible without damaging the natural structure and music of the original.
('81', 458, 1, 20, 803468) Urdu can do likewise.
('81', 458, 1, 21, 803490) There is no separate Hindustani body attempting to blend the two streams which today threaten to run away from each other.
('81', 458, 1, 22, 803613) The noble task can be performed by the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan and Anjuman e taraqqi e Urdu.
('81', 458, 1, 23, 803705) I have been connected with the former since 1918 1 when I was invited to preside at its session of that year.
('81', 458, 1, 24, 803815) I aequainted the audience with my views on the all India medium.
('81', 458, 1, 25, 803880) When I presided again at its session in 1935 2, I was able to persuade the Sammelan to define Hindi as the language spoken by Hindus and Muslims of the North of India and written either in Devanagari or Persian script.
('81', 458, 1, 26, 804099) The natural consequence should have been for the members of the Sammelan to expand their knowledge of Hindi by living up to the definition and producing literature that

('81', 459, 1, 3, 804582) This should have meant the members learning the Persian script.
('81', 459, 1, 4, 804646) They seem to have denied themselves this proud privilege.
('81', 459, 1, 5, 804704) But better late than never.
('81', 459, 1, 6, 804732) Will they bestir themselves now?
('81', 459, 1, 7, 804765) They need not wait for the Anjuman to respond.
('81', 459, 1, 8, 804812) It will be a great thing, if the Anjuman does.
('81', 459, 1, 9, 804859) Each Association can, if it will, work in harmony with the other.
('81', 459, 1, 10, 804925) But I have suggested unitary action independent of the other party.
('81', 459, 1, 11, 804993) That Association which will adopt my plan will enrich the language it stands for, and will ultimately be responsible for producing a blend which will serve the whole nation.
('81', 459, 1, 12, 805167) It is unfortunate that the Hindi Urdu question has assumed a communal shape.
('81', 459, 1, 13, 805244) It is possible for either party to undo the mischief by recognizing the other and incorporating the acceptable part in a generous spirit.
('81', 459, 1, 14, 805382) A language that borrows unstintingly from the others without harming its special characteristic will be enriched, even as the English language has become enriched by free borrowings.

('81', 459, 2, 16, 805622) 720. SPEECH AT CHOKHAMELA BOARDING HOUSE 1
('81', 459, 3, 17, 805665) NAGPUR, January 24, 1942
('81', 459, 4, 18, 805690) Gandhiji began to address the gathering.
('81', 459, 4, 19, 805731) There was noise.
('81', 459, 4, 20, 805748) In a moment a youth 2 sprang to his feet and said : This is not the ordinary noise.
('81', 459, 4, 21, 805832) We are protesting against your coming. Gandhiji invited him to come to the rostrum and say what he wanted to say.
('81', 459, 4, 22, 805946) He had nothing more to say than this : We do not want you here.
('81', 459, 4, 23, 806010) Those who invited you here had no right to do so. Asked Gandhiji of him : But why dont you want me here?
('81', 459, 5, 24, 806115) Because you have done nothing for the Harijans.
('81', 459, 5, 25, 806163) Thats all?
('81', 459, 5, 26, 806174) Have you anything more to say?
('81', 459, 6, 27, 806205) Nothing more, he said, and after a while disappeared.
('81', 459, 6, 28, 806259) I am told by the friend who raised the voice of protest that those who invited me here had no right to do so.
('81', 459, 6, 29, 806369) The fact is that it was the students of the Chokhamela 3 Boarding House who came to Wardha to invite me.
('81', 459, 6, 30, 806474) I had begged to be excused, but Shri Chaturbhuj
('81', 459, 7, 31, 806522) 1 Reproduced from Mahadev Desais An Unexpected Experience.
('81', 459, 7, 32, 806581) Gandhiji spoke in Hindustani on the occasion of the silver jubilee of the Boarding House.
('81', 459, 7, 33, 806671) On his arrival a number of Mahar youths shouted anti Gandhi slogans.

('81', 460, 1, 2, 806854) Jasani intervened and told me that, if the work that carried me to Benares was after my heart, this might be even dearer in as much as it was the silver jubilee of an institution that had served Harijan boys.
('81', 460, 1, 3, 807063) And since the abolition of untouchability is my lifes work and I even toured the country for the same cause for one whole year 1, I agreed.
('81', 460, 1, 4, 807203) But assuming that those who invited me had no right to do so, it was surely not my fault.
('81', 460, 1, 5, 807293) These protests do not displease me.
('81', 460, 1, 6, 807329) The Harijans have suffered all these centuries at the hands of the savarna Hindus as from no one else, and as I am one of the latter I am participant in their sin.
('81', 460, 1, 7, 807493) And I am never accustomed to weigh my sins in golden scales.
('81', 460, 1, 8, 807554) I can atone for them only if I made a mountain of a molehill.
('81', 460, 1, 9, 807616) The reason is simple.
('81', 460, 1, 10, 807638) Man can never see his faults in proper perspective, and if he really did so, he would scarcely survive them.
('81', 460, 1, 11, 807747) The remedy is, therefore, to magnify ones shortcomings.
('81', 460, 1, 12, 807803) And the sin of untouchability is so heinous that it is impossible to exaggerate it.
('81', 460, 1, 13, 807887) Those who suffer from it are naturally liable to be angry with those who are trying to wipe it out.
('81', 460, 1, 14, 807987) They may well say to me : Who are you to remove untouchability?
('81', 460, 1, 15, 808051) We shall wipe it out our own strength. Now the way of demonstrating ones strength is of two kinds : one is the eternal, God given way of self purification, where man takes the blame upon himself of all the wrongs he is suffering from; the other is the way of retaliation, the Mosaic law of tooth for a tooth and nail for a nail.
('81', 460, 1, 16, 808380) The latter is quite natural in that we have descended from the state of brutes, and some of their qualities may have been exaggerated in us.
('81', 460, 1, 17, 808521) It is Hitlers way.
('81', 460, 1, 18, 808540) Because a Jew or many Jews may have wronged the Germans he thinks it is his duty to exterminate the whole Jewish race.
('81', 460, 1, 19, 808659) To those Harijans who would destroy caste Hindus and Hinduism I would say that the Hindus deserve it.
('81', 460, 1, 20, 808761) But the caste Hindus too owe a duty to themselves and their religion.
('81', 460, 1, 21, 808831) Let them receive lathis and stones from Harijans.
('81', 460, 1, 22, 808881) But they should continue to serve them.
('81', 460, 1, 23, 808921) What, however, is to be done, if they will not receive our service?
('81', 460, 2, 24, 808989) Let the stones rain on us, we have to keep quiet and to hold this meeting.
('81', 460, 2, 25, 809064) I had promised to stay here for ten minutes, but I am in no hurry to go now.
('81', 460, 2, 26, 809141) Send word to the demonstrators that, if they will have a separate meeting, I am prepared to stay and address that meeting and answer the charges they may have to make against me.
('81', 460, 2, 27, 809320) And what after all is my crime?
('81', 460, 2, 28, 809352) That I am labouring for them?
('81', 460, 2, 29, 809382) That I am endeavouring to put a little money into their pockets?
('81', 460, 2, 30, 809447) That I am

('81', 461, 1, 2, 809651) telling the sanatanists day in and day out that they have to purge themselves of their sin?
('81', 461, 1, 3, 809743) And why rain stones on the innocent audience?
('81', 461, 1, 4, 809789) They wanted to hurt me, but what have they succeeded in doing?
('81', 461, 1, 5, 809852) They have hurt a few innocent people including two children in the audience.
('81', 461, 1, 6, 809929) If they wanted to punish me or those who invited me, they should have gone directly for us.
('81', 461, 1, 7, 810021) Let me tell them that this hooliganism is the opposite of bravery, humanity, civility.
('81', 461, 1, 8, 810108) Let me tell them they are going about the wrong way.
('81', 461, 1, 9, 810161) They are injuring their own cause.
('81', 461, 1, 10, 810196) Now a word to those assembled here.
('81', 461, 1, 11, 810232) Though this is a boarding house, those who receive their board and lodging here are all students.
('81', 461, 1, 12, 810330) I hope your stay here will be fruitful and give you what is real education.
('81', 461, 1, 13, 810406) Let todays demonstration be a lesson to you.
('81', 461, 1, 14, 810451) It should make you neither angry nor afraid, for anger and fear are twin sins.
('81', 461, 1, 15, 810530) Let the demonstration awaken you to your sense of duty and burn the eternal truth indelibly on your minds that only Truth quenches untruth, Love, quenches anger, self suffering quenches violence.
('81', 461, 1, 16, 810726) This eternal rule is a rule not for saints only but for all.
('81', 461, 1, 17, 810787) Those who observe it may be few but they are the salt of the earth, it is they who keep the society together, not those who sin against light and truth.
('81', 461, 1, 18, 810940) I ask you not only not to punish the demonstrators but not even to have the wish.
('81', 461, 1, 19, 811022) They are not wicked.
('81', 461, 1, 20, 811043) It is through them that God works to open our eyes to the wickedness within us.
('81', 461, 1, 21, 811123) Let, therefore, todays demonstration purify you, as I know it will purify me.
('81', 461, 1, 22, 811201) True vidya (knowledge) is the art of self purification.
('81', 461, 1, 23, 811257) Now I want you to stay here until the storm ceases, lest your going out just now should infuriate them.
('81', 461, 1, 24, 811361) Let us wait until their fury ceases, and then quietly go back to our homes.
('81', 461, 1, 25, 811437) In the mean while let us all recite Ramdhun together, let someone give us a hymn, and we shall disperse only when we are told that everything is quiet outside.
('81', 461, 2, 26, 811597) Harijan, 1 2 1942 721. TO GUJARATIS 2
('81', 461, 3, 27, 811635) You have sacrificed a great deal in the cause of swaraj.
('81', 461, 3, 28, 811692) But it is not enough.
('81', 461, 3, 29, 811714) You can contribute still more in the form of money, labour, and increasingly intelligent and fresh minds.
('81', 461, 3, 30, 811820) Is it not sad that Rs. 2 lakhs worth of khadi only is being
('81', 461, 4, 31, 811880) 1 Krishnanand Sokhta then invited the audience to join him in reciting Ramanama and the meeting dispersed peacefully thereafter.

('81', 462, 1, 2, 812125) produced in Gujarat whereas Rs. 12 lakhs worth is wanted?
('81', 462, 1, 3, 812183) It may be that there is not so much poverty in Gujarat as in the other provinces.
('81', 462, 1, 4, 812265) But that does not mean that Gujaratis cannot, if they wish, produce all the khadi they need.
('81', 462, 1, 5, 812358) Reckoning the population of Gujarat at 1 crore, the people would need at least 3 crores worth of cloth.
('81', 462, 1, 6, 812462) You should produce at least this quantity, i.e., 15 crore yards.
('81', 462, 1, 7, 812527) The time is fast approaching when we shall not be able to get mill cloth.
('81', 462, 1, 8, 812601) There is scarcity even today, and what if the mills are bombed, what if they are used as munition factories?
('81', 462, 1, 9, 812710) Either each one of us, young and old, rich and poor, man and woman, has to spin and provide for his own clothing or else go naked.
('81', 462, 1, 10, 812841) There is not the least exaggeration in this.
('81', 462, 1, 11, 812886) In the warring countries people are rationed for food and clothing, 1 and as the war is prolonged even the necessities of life are being used up and munitions are produced only to end in smoke.
('81', 462, 1, 12, 813080) The war is thus working double destruction.
('81', 462, 1, 13, 813124) We have been will nilly dragged into the vortex.
('81', 462, 1, 14, 813173) But we are not yet so hard put to it as the people in the warring countries.
('81', 462, 1, 15, 813250) If, however, we sit with folded hands until the trouble comes upon us, we shall be found to have been fools 2. We must be wise and adopt the necessary measures in time.
('81', 462, 2, 16, 813419) It is my request then to those Gujaratis whose ears I can reach that they should give as much money and as much yarn as they can to the Mahagujarat Khadi Mandal.
('81', 462, 2, 17, 813581) Receiving centres should be opened where necessary so as to save people the cost of posting yarn.
('81', 462, 2, 18, 813679) The master key to producing the requisite khadi lies in the wheel plying in every home.
('81', 462, 2, 19, 813767) If good yarn is spun, weavers will be available, though I have already advised that we should take time by the forelock and train voluntary weavers also.
('81', 462, 2, 20, 813921) Will every Congressman rise to the occasion and spin for the nation?

('81', 463, 1, 2, 814314) 722. A DEPLORABLE INCIDENT 1
('81', 463, 2, 3, 814343) As Sardar Vallabhbhai was leaving Sevagram the other day he told me of a dacoity in a home 2 in Kheda District.
('81', 463, 2, 4, 814455) Armed dacoits entered the house, belaboured the inmates, and escaped with the loot.
('81', 463, 2, 5, 814539) The story was heart rending.
('81', 463, 2, 6, 814568) What should I do under similar circumstances, I thought to myself.
('81', 463, 2, 7, 814635) What should Congressmen do in the circumstances was the next thought; and since then the train of thought arising from the dacoity has taken possession of me.
('81', 463, 2, 8, 814794) The Congress has been working continuously since 1920 under the policy of non violence.
('81', 463, 2, 9, 814882) The province of Gujarat has also had the advantage of a leader of the Sardars calibre.
('81', 463, 2, 10, 814969) And yet daring dacoities can take place.
('81', 463, 2, 11, 815010) How far then can Congress influence be said to have penetrated?
('81', 463, 2, 12, 815074) People imagine that, if the British Government were to cease to function today, it would be the non violent Congressmen who would automatically take over.
('81', 463, 2, 13, 815229) But it is not so.
('81', 463, 2, 14, 815247) I have been working to this end for the last twenty years, but my dream has not materialized.
('81', 463, 2, 15, 815341) For the Congress has not had a living faith in the very means which it adopted in 1920. Therefore the non violence of the Congress has really been non violence of the weak.
('81', 463, 2, 16, 815514) But governments can only be run by the strong.
('81', 463, 2, 17, 815561) And a non violent government can only be run by those who believe that non violence is the mightiest force on earth.
('81', 463, 2, 18, 815678) If we had had this strength, there would be no HinduMuslim riots, there would be no robbers or dacoits.
('81', 463, 2, 19, 815782) Some might say that for such strength you need either a Jesus or a Buddha.
('81', 463, 2, 20, 815857) But this is not so.
('81', 463, 2, 21, 815877) Neither Jesus nor Buddha tried non violence in the political sphere, or it would be truer to say that the present day type of politics did not exist in their day.
('81', 463, 2, 22, 816040) The Congress experiment is, therefore, a new one.
('81', 463, 2, 23, 816090) The tragedy is that Congressmen have not tried it with full faith, full understanding and sincerity.
('81', 463, 2, 24, 816191) If they had had these three essential qualities, the Congress would today have been far taller than it is.
('81', 463, 2, 25, 816298) But I may not cry over spilt milk.
('81', 463, 2, 26, 816333) I refer to the past only in order to guide us in the present.
('81', 463, 2, 27, 816395) Even if we wake up now, the game is ours; if we do not, we shall surely lose.
('81', 463, 2, 28, 816473) Power invariably elects to go into the hands of the strong.
('81', 463, 2, 29, 816533) That strength may be physical or of the heart, or, if we do not fight shy of the word, of the spirit.
('81', 463, 2, 30, 816635) Strength of the heart connotes soul force.
('81', 463, 2, 31, 816678) If today we decide that we should try to get power by force of arms, we shall have to undo all the work of twenty years among the masses.
('81', 463, 2, 32, 816816) We shall have to spend a considerable time in giving people a contrary training.
('81', 463, 2, 33, 816897) We cannot afford to give the required time at this

('81', 464, 1, 2, 817094) critical juncture.
('81', 464, 1, 3, 817113) It is certain that today whoever has any strength of any kind will use it for seizing power.
('81', 464, 1, 4, 817206) It is my firm conviction that, if Congressmen are to get power, it should only be through non violence or soul force.
('81', 464, 1, 5, 817324) We have neither time nor material to do new work even in this line.
('81', 464, 1, 6, 817392) When we have so far employed non violence as a weapon of the weak, how can we all of a sudden expect to convert it into a weapon of the strong?
('81', 464, 1, 7, 817536) But in spite of this I feel that at the present moment this experiment alone is feasible and proper for us.
('81', 464, 1, 8, 817644) There is no risk involved in it.
('81', 464, 1, 9, 817677) Even failure in it takes the form of success because, even if the people are not able to go the whole length in the experiment, they cannot possibly be led into a ditch.
('81', 464, 1, 10, 817847) By following the way of physical force they may not only be proved cowards, but in attempting to follow an untrodden path thousands may also be destroyed.
('81', 464, 1, 11, 818002) It is then the duty of Congressmen to seek out dacoits and robbers.
('81', 464, 1, 12, 818070) They should try to understand and convert them.
('81', 464, 1, 13, 818118) Such workers cannot be had for the asking; but Congressmen should know that this work is just as important as it is fraught with risk, and a certain number of them have to devote themselves to it.
('81', 464, 1, 14, 818315) The second thing requisite is that we should prepare such workers as would, under difficult circumstances, stand up to dacoits and, whilst trying to check or convert them from their evil ways, be prepared to suffer hurt or even death.
('81', 464, 1, 15, 818550) Perhaps few workers will be forthcoming for this task too, but peace brigades throughout the country are a definite necessity.
('81', 464, 1, 16, 818677) Or else in times of chaos Congressmen will lose all the reputation they have so far gained 1 .
('81', 464, 1, 17, 818772) Thirdly, the rich should ponder well as to what is their duty today.
('81', 464, 1, 18, 818841) They who employ mercenaries to guard their wealth may find those very guardians turning on them.
('81', 464, 1, 19, 818938) The monied classes
('81', 464, 2, 20, 818957) have got to learn how to fight either with arms or with the weapon of non violence.
('81', 464, 2, 21, 819041) For those who wish to follow the latter way the best and most effective mantra is :  2 (Enjoy thy wealth by renouncing it.) Expanded, it means : Earn your crores by all means.
('81', 464, 2, 22, 819217) But understand that your wealth is not yours; it belongs to the people.
('81', 464, 2, 23, 819289) Take what you require for your legitimate needs, and use the remainder for society. This truth has hitherto not been acted upon; but, if the monied classes do not even act on it in these times of

('81', 465, 1, 4, 819828) I see coming the day of the rule of the poor, whether that rule be through force of arms or of non violence.
('81', 465, 1, 5, 819937) Let it be remembered that 1 physical force is transitory even as the body is transitory.
('81', 465, 1, 6, 820026) But the power of the spirit is permanent, even as the spirit is everlasting.

('81', 465, 4, 11, 820208) Your pathetic note was received in Kashi.

('81', 465, 4, 13, 820339) 2You had met me in the morning, had you not?
('81', 465, 4, 14, 820384) But even if you had not, you should be now above these outward demonstrations of affection which is a permanent thing independent of outward manifestation.
('81', 465, 4, 15, 820540) Let your work be your sole absorption.
('81', 465, 4, 16, 820579) I am glad you are keeping fit.

('81', 466, 4, 12, 821515) Vina is in Calcutta at present.

('81', 466, 10, 23, 821946) It was good that you were able to keep Narandas.
('81', 466, 10, 24, 821995) Your encouragement will drive away his fear.

('81', 466, 10, 26, 822132) The money should be deposited with Bachharaj & Co.
('81', 466, 10, 27, 822183) But do what all of you think proper.
('81', 466, 10, 28, 822220) If Jerajani 2 continues to insist, take him on.
('81', 466, 10, 29, 822268) He too is an old hand.
('81', 466, 10, 30, 822291) He will be useful to you.
('81', 466, 10, 31, 822317) You will have to look carefully into this.

('81', 470, 1, 2, 825891) 731. QUESTION BOX
('81', 470, 2, 3, 825909) UNITARY METHOD
('81', 470, 3, 4, 825924) Q. You seem to be advocating what you call the unitary method in the
('81', 470, 4, 5, 825993) solution of many questions.
('81', 470, 4, 6, 826021) Will you explain it a little more fully than you have
('81', 470, 6, 7, 826075) A. It is as simple as it is sure.
('81', 470, 6, 8, 826109) A contract or pact is between two parties.
('81', 470, 6, 9, 826152) There is also consideration passing from one to the other.
('81', 470, 6, 10, 826211) Such was the Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the Muslim League.
('81', 470, 6, 11, 826281) The same thing could have been accomplished by the unitary method.
('81', 470, 6, 12, 826348) Only then there would have been no compromise dictated by fear and distrust.
('81', 470, 6, 13, 826425) The Congress could have done, according to its notion, absolute justice, i.e., yielded the maximum consistent with the welfare of the whole nation without the expectation of any conside ration from the League.
('81', 470, 6, 14, 826635) In a well regulated family the relations are governed by the unitary method.
('81', 470, 6, 15, 826712) Thus a father gives to his children not as a result of a pact.
('81', 470, 6, 16, 826775) He gives out of love, a sense of justice without expecting any return therefor.
('81', 470, 6, 17, 826855) Not that there is none.
('81', 470, 6, 18, 826879) But everything is natural, nothing is forced.
('81', 470, 6, 19, 826925) Nothing is done out of fear or distrust.
('81', 470, 6, 20, 826966) What is true of a well regulated family is equally true of a well regulated society which is but an extended family.
('81', 470, 6, 21, 827083) My advice about the adoption of two scripts by Hindus and Muslims is based on the unitary method.
('81', 470, 6, 22, 827181) My equal love for all communities dictates its adop tion.
('81', 470, 6, 23, 827239) Properly applied, the method never fails.
('81', 470, 6, 24, 827281) It disarms criticism and opposition.
('81', 470, 6, 25, 827318) It presupposes a clean conscience and clean action.
('81', 470, 6, 26, 827370) I pro pose to unfold in these columns the application of the method in all our communal relations.
('81', 470, 6, 27, 827469) The views will be personal to me, as are all such since the Bardoli Resolution.
('81', 470, 6, 28, 827549) They will be addressed to Con gressmen for adoption only in so far as they appeal to their reason.
('81', 470, 8, 29, 827648) Q. What has come over Rajaji?
('81', 470, 8, 30, 827678) You and he seem to be drifting away from each other.
('81', 470, 9, 31, 827731) A. Yes, we seem to be and yet we are not.
('81', 470, 9, 32, 827773) The seeming drift is but a prelude to a closer bond and clearer understanding.
('81', 470, 9, 33, 827852) His loyalty is above suspicion.
('81', 470, 9, 34, 827884) He would have gladly suppressed himself, if I had not strongly encouraged him to propound his views with a view to their adoption by the public.
('81', 470, 9, 35, 828029) We owe allegiance to the same goddess.
('81', 470, 9, 36, 828068) Our interpretations differ.
('81', 470, 9, 37, 828096) If he is erring, he will retrace his steps as soon as he discovers it.
('81', 470, 9, 38, 828167) And he knows that I would do likewise, if I
('81', 471, 0, 1, 828211) 472 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 471, 1, 2, 828253) discover mine.
('81', 471, 1, 3, 828268) I feel, therefore, absolutely safe with him, and I ask all questioners to do likewise.
('81', 471, 2, 4, 828355) UNTRUTH
('81', 471, 3, 5, 828363) Q. Do you know that you are reported to have said at Benares that it is sinful for any Indian ever to study or speak in English and you are charged with insincerity in that you make such liberal use of the hated language when it suits you?
('81', 471, 4, 6, 828603) A. The report is wholly untrue.
('81', 471, 4, 7, 828635) But once an untruth gets a start it is most difficult to overtake.
('81', 471, 4, 8, 828702) Many untruths about me have had such a start.
('81', 471, 4, 9, 828748) They created a temporary sensation and got a decent burial without any effort on my part.
('81', 471, 4, 10, 828838) So will this one.
('81', 471, 4, 11, 828856) No untruth has ever done any harm to anyone if there was no bottom to it.
('81', 471, 4, 12, 828930) I am answering the question, not to protect my reputation but to carry my point further.
('81', 471, 4, 13, 829019) The charge of insincerity is itself the best refutation of the untruth.
('81', 471, 4, 14, 829091) For my free use of the English language is not a thing of today.
('81', 471, 4, 15, 829156) The charge should have been regarded as unworthy of belief.
('81', 471, 4, 16, 829216) Let it be known that I am a lover of the English language and the English.
('81', 471, 4, 17, 829291) But my love is wise and intelligent.
('81', 471, 4, 18, 829328) Therefore I give both the place they deserve.
('81', 471, 4, 19, 829374) Thus I do not allow the English language to dis place the mother tongue or the natural all India languageHindus tani.
('81', 471, 4, 20, 829492) Nor do I let my love of the English displace my fellow country men whose interest I can in no way allow to be injured.
('81', 471, 4, 21, 829611) I recognize the great importance of the English language for international intercourse.
('81', 471, 4, 22, 829699) I hold its knowledge as a second language to be indispen sable for specified Indians who have to represent the countrys interest in the international domain.
('81', 471, 4, 23, 829857) I regard the English language as an open window for peeping into Western thought and sciences.
('81', 471, 4, 24, 829952) For this too I should set apart a class.
('81', 471, 4, 25, 829993) Through them I would spread through the Indian languages the knowledge they have gained from the West.
('81', 471, 4, 26, 830096) But I would not burden Indias children and sap their youthful energy by expecting the expansion of their brains through the medium of a foreign language.
('81', 471, 4, 27, 830250) I do hold it to be a sin on the part of those who are responsible for producing the unnatural condition under which we are being educated.
('81', 471, 4, 28, 830389) Such a thing is unknown in any other part of the world.
('81', 471, 4, 29, 830445) Being too near the scene of the wreck we are unaware of the damage the nation has suffered by it.
('81', 471, 4, 30, 830543) I can see the enormity of the damage because of my daily and close contact with the dumb and suppressed millions.
('81', 471, 5, 31, 830657) ANOTHER UNTRUTH
('81', 471, 6, 32, 830673) Q. You are reported by the Press to have approvingly referred to the progress made by the Japanese in adopting Western methods with a thoroughness hitherto unknown in the East.
('81', 471, 6, 33, 830850) Is not this a contradiction of all you have written about the West?
('81', 471, 6, 34, 830918) Or is there one law for India and another for Japan?
('81', 472, 0, 1, 830971) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 473
('81', 472, 1, 2, 831018) A. This is another untruth like the one about the English language.
('81', 472, 1, 3, 831086) The reader will find out for himself from Mahadev Desais report of my Benares speech 1 as to what I actually said about the Japanese.
('81', 472, 1, 4, 831220) The burden of my speech was the undesirability of making English the medium of instruction and all India speech.
('81', 472, 1, 5, 831333) I said in this connection that, however harmful in my opinion the Japanese adaptation of the West was, the rapid progress was due to the restric tion of the learning of the Western mode to a select few and using them for transmission of the new knowledge among the Japanese through their own mother tongue.
('81', 472, 1, 6, 831640) Surely it is easy enough to under stand that the Japanese could never have adapted themselves to the new mode, if they had had to do so through a foreign medium.

('81', 472, 3, 9, 831893) LILI, I am replying to your letter the moment I got it.
('81', 472, 3, 10, 831949) I did not like your account of how you were working.
('81', 472, 3, 11, 832002) I have told you a thousand times not to get impatient.
('81', 472, 3, 12, 832057) Whatever knowledge you acquire will not be wasted.
('81', 472, 3, 13, 832108) You should thoroughly understand the subjects.
('81', 472, 3, 14, 832155) Learn only what you can without over exerting yourself.
('81', 472, 3, 15, 832211) Have a talk with your Principal and other professors.
('81', 472, 3, 16, 832265) Let me know what they say.
('81', 472, 3, 17, 832292) I would not at all like your giving up your studies.
('81', 472, 3, 18, 832345) I am not keen that you should take the examination this year.
('81', 472, 3, 19, 832407) Of course if you can do so without difficulty, you may.
('81', 472, 3, 20, 832463) But I should regard it as sheer folly and theft of public money for you to benumb your brain by keeping awake at night and drinking pots of tea.
('81', 472, 3, 21, 832608) A person like you ought not to throw away money like this.

('81', 473, 1, 2, 832870) 733. TALK TO KHADI VIDYALAYA STUDENTS 1
('81', 473, 2, 3, 832910) SEVAGRAM, January 29, 1942 I have something to say about the manner in which you just came and sat here.
('81', 473, 2, 4, 833015) 2 The task before us is so great and pure that it should influence our manner of speech as well as movement, in fact all our actions as well as thoughts.
('81', 473, 2, 5, 833169) When we assemble to hear someone we should sit in a decent posture, without being huddled together.
('81', 473, 2, 6, 833269) And we should make it a point to sit up straight and erect and in an attentive posture.
('81', 473, 2, 7, 833357) The way you are huddled together, one upon another, shows a lack of manners, of culture.
('81', 473, 2, 8, 833446) Every tradition has its own definite style of deportment.
('81', 473, 2, 9, 833504) In Western countries, people sit on chairs in a prescribed manner.
('81', 473, 2, 10, 833571) The military training they receive also influences their style.
('81', 473, 2, 11, 833635) We also have our own concept of good manners.
('81', 473, 2, 12, 833681) But we have forgotten it.
('81', 473, 2, 13, 833707) We have learnt nothing new from the West.
('81', 473, 2, 14, 833749) That is why our plight is like Trishankus 3, neither here nor there.
('81', 473, 2, 15, 833818) We have our own code of postures, which helps make physical as well as spiritual progress.
('81', 473, 2, 16, 833909) It is something we can offer the world provided we assimilate it in our lives.
('81', 473, 2, 17, 833988) But we have now grown indo lent.
('81', 473, 2, 18, 834021) This is about the ancient Hindu tradition.
('81', 473, 2, 19, 834064) The Arabs too have their own code of etiquette.
('81', 473, 2, 20, 834112) They also have a graceful manner of sitting and rising.
('81', 473, 2, 21, 834168) Their prayers too are offered in their own prescribed style.
('81', 473, 2, 22, 834229) In short, the only purpose of my saying all this is that whatever we do should have a method about ita code to govern it.
('81', 473, 2, 23, 834351) If you fulfil the expectations entertained about you, you can surpass the students of Government schools or colleges.
('81', 473, 2, 24, 834469) In my view the importance of this Vidyalaya is not less but in fact more than that of a school or college.
('81', 473, 2, 25, 834576) You are judged also by the way you lie and sit, by the manner and matter of your talk.
('81', 473, 2, 26, 834663) Every action of a man from the cradle to the grave should be steeped in his culture.
('81', 473, 2, 27, 834748) I would like to see your own culture in every one of your actions.
('81', 473, 2, 28, 834815) It is not enough for you merely to learn spinning and weaving; it is only a means.
('81', 473, 2, 29, 834898) Two things are most essential for man to subsist.
('81', 473, 2, 30, 834948) One is food and the other clothing.
('81', 473, 2, 31, 834984) There are three ways of solving the problem of food and clothing.
('81', 473, 2, 32, 835050) One of them is to get them in the form of charity.
('81', 473, 2, 33, 835101) But it is not proper.
('81', 473, 2, 34, 835123) It does not mitigate the poverty of the people.
('81', 473, 3, 35, 835171) 1 After the evening prayer Gandhiji addressed the students from different provinces who had one months training at the Vidyalaya.
('81', 473, 3, 36, 835301) 2 There was some confusion when the students took their seats at the meeting.
('81', 473, 3, 37, 835379) 3 Who hung between heaven and earth
('81', 474, 0, 1, 835415) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 475
('81', 474, 1, 2, 835462) the contrary, it makes beggars of them.
('81', 474, 1, 3, 835502) The other way is to take up employment and earn wages with which to subsist.
('81', 474, 1, 4, 835579) This too makes us dependent.
('81', 474, 1, 5, 835608) The third way is to arrange the production of food and clothing.
('81', 474, 1, 6, 835673) This can be done in two ways.
('81', 474, 1, 7, 835703) Either through spinning wheels or through mechanized factories.
('81', 474, 1, 8, 835767) By mass producing the goods we can certainly become self dependent collectively, but not individually.
('81', 474, 1, 9, 835870) In case of air raids where will they drop the bombs if not on the workshops and factories?
('81', 474, 1, 10, 835961) Certainly not on the [small] dwelling units where taklis and spinning wheels are plying.
('81', 474, 1, 11, 836050) If eventually we are left with no other means of producing cloth, we shall be obliged to depend on others for our needs.
('81', 474, 1, 12, 836171) And if the factories are diverted to the manufacture of ammunitions, there will be no other means but the spinning wheel left with us.
('81', 474, 1, 13, 836306) All this can happen in future.
('81', 474, 1, 14, 836337) If we can foresee it we should provide for it right from today.
('81', 474, 1, 15, 836401) Today we need khadi worth one billion rupees, out of which we shall be able to produce at the most khadi worth one crore.
('81', 474, 1, 16, 836523) It is no great achievement in my view.
('81', 474, 1, 17, 836562) You are being trained here so that when you leave you may teach the people to produce their own requirements and stand on their own legs.
('81', 474, 1, 18, 836700) Today if someone comes to me even after passing his M.A., I would ask him too what his ultimate aim in life was.
('81', 474, 1, 19, 836813) What does he want to do?
('81', 474, 1, 20, 836838) Employment of some sort, isnt it?
('81', 474, 1, 21, 836872) To secure employ ment and earn his bread.
('81', 474, 1, 22, 836914) But that is not your aim.
('81', 474, 1, 23, 836940) If you come here to be trained so that you can earn your bread you cannot interest a man like me.
('81', 474, 1, 24, 837038) Here is before you a course covering one year, not several as in the schools and colleges.
('81', 474, 1, 25, 837129) The aim is to devise a scheme by which the whole of India, every single man in the country, can stand on his own feet.
('81', 474, 1, 26, 837248) By producing cloth in the mills the money does not go to the poor but it moves from the poor mans pocket into the rich mans.
('81', 474, 1, 27, 837373) On the other hand, if I buy khadi, I transfer some money to the poor and help them to be self reliant.
('81', 474, 1, 28, 837476) In this way if we succeed in making them self reliant in one matter alone, they will themselves learn to be so in all other matters.
('81', 474, 1, 29, 837609) Khadi is like the carpenters set square.
('81', 474, 1, 30, 837650) When with its help he corrects one angle, the remaining angles stand corrected in consequence.
('81', 474, 1, 31, 837745) In the same way, if we could establish khadi, many other things would take root without special effort on our part.
('81', 474, 1, 32, 837861) As a result of the work we have done for khadi, many village industries have now been revived and the activities of the A. I. V. I. A. are gaining ground.
('81', 474, 1, 33, 838016) If you look at khadi work from this angle, you will realize what splendid thing khadi is and consequently your work and its impact too will be equally splendid.
('81', 475, 0, 1, 838177) 476 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 475, 1, 2, 838219) Bear in mind that you are learning the way of filling the poor mans pocket and not your familys.
('81', 475, 1, 3, 838316) If we fail to appreciate this point, we all shall have to repent in the end.
('81', 475, 1, 4, 838393) You had better look out now, quit this work and take up another profession or employment.
('81', 475, 1, 5, 838483) In this context, I have deliberately omitted to mention the countrys independence and politics, although they are all intercon nected.
('81', 475, 1, 6, 838618) If we could make the poor people of India self reliant in necessaries, swaraj will be within our reach.
('81', 475, 1, 7, 838722) In my view, that alone would be real swaraj, and nothing else.
('81', 475, 1, 8, 838785) If you will go through Shri Rajendra Babus recent essay on constructive programme you will know what an important role khadi has in the struggle for indepen dence.
('81', 475, 1, 9, 838949) Those of you who are leaving today should understand that whatever they have learnt or done here during these four weeks is nothing more than superficial introduction.
('81', 475, 1, 10, 839117) They must increase their knowledge.
('81', 475, 1, 11, 839153) If you have not developed a scientific outlook, if you have not learnt to think the scientific way, you will not be able to develop whatever you have gained here, nor will you be able to fulfil the expectations entertained of you.
('81', 475, 1, 12, 839384) Here you have been entrusted with a key to a store of knowledge and if you have learnt to use it, I trust you will draw from that store new things every day and enrich yourselves.
('81', 475, 1, 13, 839564) A teacher who establishes rapport with the taught, becomes one with them, learns more from them than he teaches them.
('81', 475, 1, 14, 839682) He who learns nothing from his disciples is, in my opinion, worthless.
('81', 475, 1, 15, 839753) When ever I talk with someone I learn from him.
('81', 475, 1, 16, 839801) I take from him more than I give him.
('81', 475, 1, 17, 839839) In this way, a true teacher regards himself as a student of his students.
('81', 475, 1, 18, 839913) If you will teach your pupils with this attitude, you will benefit much from them.
('81', 475, 1, 19, 839996) In my opinion the late Maganlal Gandhi was such an ideal khadi worker.
('81', 475, 1, 20, 840067) He proved his worth beyond my expectations.
('81', 475, 1, 21, 840111) Even strugg ling against the most formidable difficulties, he used to learn some thing useful to him wherever he could.
('81', 475, 1, 22, 840231) He was neither afraid nor tired of hardships.
('81', 475, 1, 23, 840277) Till his death he engaged himself in learning more and more about khadi.
('81', 475, 1, 24, 840350) I want you to follow in your life this ideal of Maganlal Gandhi.
('81', 475, 1, 25, 840415) Remember, if on returning to your home provinces you do not develop the knowledge acquired here, you will lose very soon what you carry with you.
('81', 475, 1, 26, 840561) If you want to develop your know ledge, know that it can grow only by teaching it to the others.
('81', 475, 1, 27, 840658) If you continue to be such progressive and brilliant workers you will, I am sure, grow from 13 to 130 in a very short time.
('81', 476, 0, 1, 840782) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 477
('81', 476, 1, 2, 840829) So, I am placing a great burden on the teachers who are leaving this place today.
('81', 476, 1, 3, 840911) Please carry it with you.
('81', 476, 1, 4, 840937) From wherever you will go and work I expect to hear that you are honest gentlemen and devoted servants of the country.
('81', 476, 1, 5, 841056) If anyone wants to ask any question he may do so.
('81', 476, 2, 6, 841106) Q. What should a khadi worker do to guard himself against lethargy and
('81', 476, 4, 7, 841177) GANDHIJI : He should spin regularly and attentively for eight hours every day without a break.
('81', 476, 4, 8, 841272) If, while plying the wheel, he thinks only of service to Daridranarayana, pride will not be able to cast its shadow on him, and how can lethargy remain?
('81', 476, 5, 9, 841425) Q. What should a khadi worker do in case his subordinates do not carry out
('81', 476, 6, 10, 841500) his instructions?
('81', 476, 6, 11, 841518) Should he punish them?
('81', 476, 6, 12, 841541) Should he get angry?
('81', 476, 7, 13, 841562) GANDHIJI : He should try to convert them through patience with out losing his temper.
('81', 476, 7, 14, 841648) It has been my experience that when I become angry, I fail to convince.
('81', 476, 7, 15, 841720) Anger is an enemy of reason.
('81', 476, 7, 16, 841749) That is why we should not lose temper.
('81', 476, 7, 17, 841788) Similarly, we cannot also mete out punish ment.
('81', 476, 7, 18, 841836) If any punishment is necessary, we should ourselves undertake a fast.
('81', 476, 7, 19, 841906) But if the interest of khadi work demands it, the person con cerned can be relieved.

('81', 476, 9, 23, 842108) I acted upon them immediately.

('81', 476, 9, 25, 842162) She has realized her error somewhat and feels ashamed.
('81', 476, 9, 26, 842217) But my words are likely to have no permanent effect on her.
('81', 476, 9, 27, 842277) After my rebuke, she gave me the accompanying letter 1. I have read it.
('81', 476, 9, 28, 842349) It means nothing.
('81', 476, 9, 29, 842367) When are you coming here?
('81', 476, 9, 30, 842393) If you wish, I would shift Champa from that room.
('81', 476, 9, 31, 842443) It is reserved for you exclusively.
('81', 476, 9, 32, 842479) It will take some time before your building is ready.
('81', 476, 9, 33, 842533) Till then you may treat this room as your own.
('81', 476, 9, 34, 842580) I have put Champa there as your representative.

('81', 477, 6, 14, 843231) You cite the remarks of others in support of your criticism and they too will caution me.
('81', 477, 6, 15, 843321) 1 I do admit that there is substance in one point.
('81', 477, 6, 16, 843372) My past experiences are no valid arguments.
('81', 477, 6, 17, 843416) They may give me strength, but as arguments their value is limited.
('81', 477, 6, 18, 843484) If the experiments in the past were based on error, the error is not mitigated but multiplied by repeating those experiments.
('81', 477, 6, 19, 843610) I plead completely guilty to your second charge.
('81', 477, 6, 20, 843659) I am in no position now to write long and interesting letters.
('81', 477, 6, 21, 843722) I can do that only if I went to jail.
('81', 477, 6, 22, 843760) Nor can I talk interestingly.
('81', 477, 6, 23, 843790) The pressure on my time has become much too heavy for that.

('81', 478, 1, 2, 844273) 736. MY SINCERITY
('81', 478, 2, 3, 844291) I have been asked which way my sympathy lies.
('81', 478, 2, 4, 844337) From a purely humanitarian point of view, undoubtedly, it is all with England.
('81', 478, 2, 5, 844416) I do not wish that the British should be defeated, nor do I wish the defeat of the Germans.
('81', 478, 2, 6, 844508) There will be very little meaning and charm for us in the rest of the world if an entire people, to whichever nation they belong, remain downtrodden, humiliated and embittered.
('81', 478, 2, 7, 844685) Will not bitterness in any one nation constitute seeds of a future war?
('81', 478, 2, 8, 844757) Whatever it is, if the present war continues till the bitter end, civilization itself will be reduced to ashes in this conflagration.
('81', 478, 2, 9, 844891) Let us pray that it will stop before it is too late.
('81', 478, 2, 10, 844944) Still, can it stop so long as there is hatred in the hearts of men?
('81', 478, 2, 11, 845012) If I have hatred for even one individual, will it not imperceptibly spread to all his countrymen?
('81', 478, 2, 12, 845110) Of course, there is ample reason for condemning the German dictator.
('81', 478, 2, 13, 845179) But if I wish that armies bid farewell to arms and refrain from bloodshedsince this is the only meaning and message of ahimsaI should adhere to my con viction and should have no hatred for any living human being.
('81', 478, 2, 14, 845392) Although I am pained at his deeds, I can have no hatred even for Adolf Hitler.

('81', 478, 3, 16, 845508) 737. DHANUSH TAKLI
('81', 478, 4, 17, 845527) I think dhanush takli is going to play a big role in the constructive programme.
('81', 478, 4, 18, 845608) Today I am not going to enter into the relative merits and demerits of dhanush takli and the spinning wheel.
('81', 478, 4, 19, 845717) I am convinced that we cannot manufacture spinning wheels by thousands.
('81', 478, 4, 20, 845789) It requires plenty of money which we do not have.
('81', 478, 4, 21, 845839) Nor can they be manufactured at every place.
('81', 478, 4, 22, 845884) They are also hardly portable.
('81', 478, 4, 23, 845915) It is not possible either to make good taklis at every place, nor can we spin fast with them.
('81', 478, 4, 24, 846009) That leaves only the dhanush takli which can be made with little labour and less money.
('81', 478, 4, 25, 846097) We can also spin fast with it.
('81', 478, 4, 26, 846128) Therefore, I request all khadi workers to study the dhanush takli, learn to make it and popularize it.
('81', 478, 4, 27, 846231) Manufacture of new spinning wheels should be postponed for the time being.
('81', 478, 4, 28, 846306) By all means make the best use of the existing ones.
('81', 478, 4, 29, 846359) Those who can and wish to manufacture the spinning wheels locally
('81', 479, 0, 1, 846425) 480 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 479, 1, 2, 846467) may do so.
('81', 479, 1, 3, 846478) But in order to create an atmosphere for dhanush takli all the new spinners should be supplied with dhanush taklis only.
('81', 479, 1, 4, 846599) All khadi workers should peruse from Harijan my article 1 on the subject.

('81', 479, 3, 7, 846759) KRISHNACHANDRA, Your question is right.
('81', 479, 3, 8, 846799) Ordinarily such things cannot be passed.
('81', 479, 3, 9, 846840) But it is reasonable to give this much to Lakshmidas.
('81', 479, 3, 10, 846894) He should be paid every month, if he asks for it.

('81', 479, 6, 13, 847057) WARDHA, February 1, 1942
('81', 479, 7, 14, 847082) Gandhiji with biting irony .
('81', 479, 7, 15, 847111) lurid light on the worship of the cow as seen in the streets of Bombay.
('81', 479, 7, 16, 847183) We catch her by the tail and sanctify our eyes with its sacred touch.
('81', 479, 7, 17, 847253) We regard even her urine as sacred and full of medicinal value and drink it.
('81', 479, 7, 18, 847330) Alas, the poor cow is innocent of all this worship, and so our worship is lost on her.
('81', 479, 7, 19, 847417) It even scares her.
('81', 479, 7, 20, 847437) When it scares her she answers our attentions with a kick; when she is not scared she suffers us.
('81', 479, 7, 21, 847535) All this is too true and those who claim to protect the cow betray a criminal ignorance of the real method of protecting her and her progeny.
('81', 479, 7, 22, 847677) Those who claim to worship the cow cruelly ill treat the bullocks.
('81', 479, 7, 23, 847744) Chaunde Maharaj has been working at the problem assidu ously for years, but whilst he accepts my facts and even argument, he says, What about the public sentiment?
('81', 479, 7, 24, 847908) They somehow want to save the cow from the butcher. But they go about the wrong way and succeed in defeating the very object they are trying to achieve.
('81', 479, 8, 25, 848061) 1 Vide Real War Effort, 19 1 1942.
('81', 479, 9, 26, 848096) 2 Reproduced from Mahadev Desais Goseva SanghI and II.
('81', 479, 9, 27, 848151) Gandhiji inaugurated the first conference held under the presidentship of Vinoba Bhave.
('81', 480, 0, 1, 848239) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 481
('81', 480, 1, 2, 848286) not say this in a carping spirit, but shocking ignorance and want of understanding of the essentials of the problem betrayed by most of the people who run our pinjrapoles 1 dismay me.
('81', 480, 2, 3, 848470) He referred in passing to the wrong way of protecting the cow from a Mussal man wanting to slaughter her, and said that he would repeat ad nauseam that to quarrel with the Mussalman and to kill him in order to protect the cow was to instigate more slaughter.
('81', 480, 2, 4, 848729) The whole milk and ghee trade is in the hands of the Hindus.
('81', 480, 2, 5, 848790) But have we been able to ensure a supply of pure milk and ghee?
('81', 480, 2, 6, 848854) The milk is adulterated, and even the water used for adulteration is not clean.
('81', 480, 2, 7, 848934) The cruel and criminal process of phooka 2 is well known.
('81', 480, 2, 8, 848992) The ghee sold in the market can often be described as poison rather than ghee.
('81', 480, 2, 9, 849071) The butter we get from New Zealand, Australia or Denmark is guaranteed pure cows butter, but there is no guarantee about the butter or ghee available here.
('81', 480, 2, 10, 849227) There is not a shop in Wardha, where some of us are keen on this problem, where one could go and buy a seer of cows ghee of guaranteed purity.
('81', 480, 3, 11, 849370) I therefore say that if I can really protect the cow by adopting proper ways and means, I would protect the rest of the animals.
('81', 480, 3, 12, 849499) But it can be done only if we know the true science and economy of it.
('81', 480, 3, 13, 849570) Only then shall we be able to interest Perinbehn in the problem.
('81', 480, 3, 14, 849635) 4 I am amazed at our partiality for buffalos milk and ghee.
('81', 480, 3, 15, 849695) Our economics is short sighted.
('81', 480, 3, 16, 849727) We look at the immediate gain, but we do not realize that in the last analysis the cow is the more valuable animal.
('81', 480, 3, 17, 849843) Cows butter (and ghee) has a naturally yellowish colour which indicates its superiority to buffalos butter (and ghee) in carotene.
('81', 480, 3, 18, 849974) It has a flavour all its own.
('81', 480, 3, 19, 850004) Foreign visitors who come to Sevagram go into raptures over the pure cows milk they get there.
('81', 480, 3, 20, 850099) Buffalos milk and butter are almost unknown in Europe.
('81', 480, 3, 21, 850154) It is only in India that one finds a prejudice in favour of buffalos milk and ghee.
('81', 480, 3, 22, 850238) This has spelt all but extinction of the cow, and that is why I say that, unless we put an
('81', 480, 4, 23, 850329) 1 Place where aged and infirm cattle are cared for 2 Blowing 3 Mahadev Desai introduces the next paragraph with the following note : Every animalin fact all lifeis sacred and should be protected, but unless we really protect the one that was most valuable in national economy, other animals could not be protected.
('81', 480, 4, 24, 850644) In our neglect of the cow we had brought both the cow and the buffalo at deaths door. 4 Perinbehn Captain, on being invited to the conference, had declined saying : None of this travesty of worship for me.
('81', 480, 4, 25, 850850) I might attend when you have put it on a rational footing and shown by concrete work that the Hindus really care for the cow.
('81', 480, 4, 26, 850976) And if you will protect the cow, why not the horse and the dog tooboth of them equally noble?
('81', 481, 0, 1, 851070) 482 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 481, 1, 2, 851112) exclusive emphasis on the cow, she cannot be saved.
('81', 481, 1, 3, 851164) It is a tragedy that all the cows and buffaloes put together cannot give us enough milk for the 40 crores of our people.
('81', 481, 1, 4, 851285) We ought to realize the value of the cow as a giver of milk and the mother of draught and agricultural cattle.
('81', 481, 1, 5, 851396) And how far is one to pamper popular prejudices?
('81', 481, 1, 6, 851445) A cow proves valuable even if she dies, if we would make use of the skin, the bone, the flesh, the entrails and so on.
('81', 481, 1, 7, 851564) But the good Chaunde Maharaj wonders if people can be persuaded to believe that dead cows hide is sacred.
('81', 481, 1, 8, 851670) Why not?
('81', 481, 1, 9, 851679) I would not hesitate to go into my house with shoes made of dead cows hide, provided of course the shoes are clean.
('81', 481, 1, 10, 851795) I should not hesitate to have my meal with such clean shoes on.
('81', 481, 1, 11, 851859) I have to do all this in order to show that the cow is an asset and not a liability.
('81', 481, 1, 12, 851944) Today in many places they bury dead cows or sell them away for a song.
('81', 481, 1, 13, 852015) We despise the Harijans who eat carrion, but we forget that it is due to our own fault.
('81', 481, 1, 14, 852103) If we treated the hide properly, if we knew the manurial value of the flesh, and the use of the bone and the entrailswhich we are demonstrating at Nalwadithere would be no carrion eating.
('81', 481, 1, 15, 852291) Ever since my return to India from South Africa I have been harping on the question of the reform of pinjrapoles.
('81', 481, 1, 16, 852405) Unless we realize and define their proper functions, they are sure to remain the economic waste they are.
('81', 481, 1, 17, 852511) Their proper function is to take care of dry, old and disabled cows, of which individual owners cannot possibly take carecertainly not in towns and cities.
('81', 481, 1, 18, 852667) Their function is not that of a dairythough they may run a separate dairy if they canbut the care of the old and the disabled animals, and to provide the raw material for a tannery.
('81', 481, 1, 19, 852849) There should be a well equipped tannery attached to every pinjrapoles.
('81', 481, 1, 20, 852920) They should maintain the best stud bulls and loan them out for public use, they should provide every facility for the humane and scientific castration of bulls to be turned into bullocks, and there should be instruction centres for the agricul turist and the dairy farmer.
('81', 481, 1, 21, 853193) Here is plenty of scope for our agricul tural and dairy graduates who should receive additional training for the special work and then be attached to every one of our pinjrapoles.
('81', 481, 1, 22, 853373) All the pinjrapoles should then be affiliated to our Association which should be the central institution for expert advice, collection and co ordination of information and statistics, and so on.
('81', 481, 1, 23, 853568) The Association has made it a rule to have as its members those who take the following pledge :
('81', 481, 2, 24, 853664) I agree with the object and means of the Association.
('81', 481, 2, 25, 853718) I promise to use cows milk and its products exclusively, except for medical purposes or under unavoidable circumstances or in the articles of food containing milk and its products in a negligible quantity.
('81', 481, 2, 26, 853924) I will refrain from
('81', 482, 0, 1, 853944) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 483
('81', 482, 1, 2, 853991) the use of the leather of slaughtered cows, bullocks and calves.
('81', 482, 2, 3, 854056) I will donate a sum of rupee one or 2,000 yards of self spun yarn to the Association every year.
('81', 482, 2, 4, 854153) Do not magnify the so called difficulties and the embarrassment you would cause to your hosts.
('81', 482, 2, 5, 854248) You can go about with cows ghee wherever you goas Kakasaheb doesor you can do without it.
('81', 482, 2, 6, 854338) It will be good propaganda, and you may succeed in converting your hosts also.
('81', 482, 2, 7, 854417) But duty is not always easy of performance.
('81', 482, 2, 8, 854461) To run away from it is the opposite of manliness, opposite of humanity.
('81', 482, 3, 9, 854533) Answering a question, Gandhiji said that goseva formed part of the cons tructive programme of the Congress.
('81', 482, 3, 10, 854641) Mahatma Gandhi appealed to the audience to stabilize and organize pinjra poles.
('81', 482, 3, 11, 854721) Even Muslims could co operate in this cow protection and preservation work, as it would increase milch cattle, give nutrition and preserve a good supply of bullocks for cultivation.
('81', 482, 3, 12, 854903) Unless you offer your full co operation to Jamnalalji, especially on the question of pinjrapoles, his best efforts cannot succeed.
('81', 482, 3, 13, 855034) Today the cow is on the brink of extinction, and I am not sure that our efforts will ultimately succeed.
('81', 482, 3, 14, 855139) But if she dies, we also die along with herwe, i.e., our civilization.
('81', 482, 3, 15, 855210) I mean our essentially non violent and rural civilization.
('81', 482, 3, 16, 855269) We have, therefore, to make our choice.
('81', 482, 3, 17, 855309) We can choose to be violent and kill all uneconomic cattle.
('81', 482, 3, 18, 855369) Like Europe we should then breed our cattle for the purposes of milk and meat.
('81', 482, 3, 19, 855448) But our civilization is fundamentally different.
('81', 482, 3, 20, 855497) Our life is wrapped up in our animals.
('81', 482, 3, 21, 855536) Most of our villagers live with their animals, often under the same roof.
('81', 482, 3, 22, 855610) Both live together, both starve together.
('81', 482, 3, 23, 855652) Often enough the owner starves the poor cattle, exploits them, ill treats them, unmercifully extracts work out of them.
('81', 482, 3, 24, 855772) But if we reform our ways, we can both be saved.
('81', 482, 3, 25, 855821) Otherwise we sink together, and it is just as well that we swim or sink together.
('81', 482, 3, 26, 855903) The question today is to solve the problem of our starvation and poverty, but I have confined myself to the problem of the starvation and poverty of our cattle.
('81', 482, 3, 27, 856064) Our rishis 2 showed us the sovereign remedy.
('81', 482, 3, 28, 856109) Protect the cow, they said, and you protect all. We have to add to the talents they have left us, and not to waste them.
('81', 482, 3, 29, 856230) We have invited the experts, 3 and we shall make every use of their advice.
('81', 482, 3, 30, 856306) Nothing that we laymen say is final, we shall get the experts to test it with their

('81', 483, 3, 5, 856863) 740. THREE ESSENTIALS
('81', 483, 4, 6, 856885) Assuming the presence of the will among the millions, rapid spread of hand spinning is possible only by the adoption of the following three things : 1. Use of unginned cotton from the nearest spot when it is not grown on ones own plot.
('81', 483, 4, 7, 857121) 2. Ginning it on a polished board with an iron or smooth wooden rod and carding the cotton by manipulation of the cotton with fingers assisted by a wooden knife made on the spot.
('81', 483, 4, 8, 857300) This process is called tunai ( ).
('81', 483, 4, 9, 857334) 3. Spinning the slivers on the dhanush takli.
('81', 483, 4, 10, 857380) Hand gins cannot be manufactured to order today.
('81', 483, 4, 11, 857429) All available unginned cotton should be prepared first by the method explained in 2 above.
('81', 483, 4, 12, 857520) Where unginned cotton is not available ginned cotton from factories has got to be used.
('81', 483, 4, 13, 857608) It too lends itself to tunai, though much more time is required for carding by the tunai process when bale cotton has to be used.
('81', 483, 4, 14, 857738) Where a carding bow is available, naturally it will be used.
('81', 483, 4, 15, 857799) But what is true of ginning is equally true of carding.
('81', 483, 4, 16, 857855) It is not possible to manufacture bows and gut in a moment.
('81', 483, 4, 17, 857915) Tunai is a method devised and being perfected by Shri Vinoba with an artists skill and ardour.
('81', 483, 4, 18, 858010) When spinning spreads among the millions it will be impossible to supply slivers from a centre or centres.
('81', 483, 4, 19, 858117) The utmost that is possible is for families or groups to set apart one or two hands per a fixed number for carding.
('81', 483, 4, 20, 858233) The ideal, the best, and in the long run the quickest, way is for each one to prepare his own slivers.
('81', 483, 4, 21, 858336) It makes spinning more interesting, and the variety of occupation breaks the monotony.
('81', 483, 4, 22, 858423) I suggest that, though the crisis is not yet felt and the mills are working, khadi workers will do well from now to adopt the suggestions I have made.
('81', 483, 4, 23, 858574) When the crisis does come, we shall then be found ready.

('81', 484, 1, 2, 858724) 741. HINDI + URDU = HINDUSTANI
('81', 484, 2, 3, 858755) The following letter 1 was written on the 29th ultimo and sent to me by its writer by registered post.
('81', 484, 2, 4, 858858) It was received at Sevagram on the 31st ultimo : The writer has signed the letter, but as it is marked personal I refrain from giving his name.
('81', 484, 2, 5, 859002) In any case the name does not matter.
('81', 484, 2, 6, 859040) What the writer says is, I know, the belief held by many Muslims.
('81', 484, 2, 7, 859106) My repudiation has not undone the mischief.
('81', 484, 2, 8, 859150) But my article 2 which was written on the 23rd ultimo and has appeared in Harijan of the 1st instant, should soothe the writer so far as I am concerned.
('81', 484, 2, 9, 859303) I entirely agree with my correspondent that all who want one all India speech should today learn both the formsHindi and Urdu.
('81', 484, 2, 10, 859430) Those who do will ultimately give us a common language.
('81', 484, 2, 11, 859486) That form which is more popular and more understood by the masses, whether Hindu or Muslim, will surely be the all India speech.
('81', 484, 2, 12, 859615) But if my proposal finds general acceptance, the language question will cease to be a political issue or a bone of contention.
('81', 484, 2, 13, 859742) I do not subscribe to the correspondents statement that Urdu is more developed, more beautiful, more attractive, more concise, and more expressive.
('81', 484, 2, 14, 859890) No language is intrinsically all that the corres pondent says.
('81', 484, 2, 15, 859953) A language becomes what its speakers and writers make it.
('81', 484, 2, 16, 860011) English had no merit apart from what Englishmen made it.
('81', 484, 2, 17, 860068) In other words, a language is a human creation and takes the colour of its creators.
('81', 484, 2, 18, 860153) Every language is capable of infinite expansion.
('81', 484, 2, 19, 860202) Modern Bengali is what Bankim 3 and Rabindranath have made it.
('81', 484, 2, 20, 860265) If, therefore, it is true that Urdu is more everything than Hindi, it is because its creators are abler than those of Hindi.
('81', 484, 2, 21, 860390) I can give no opinion, for I have not studied either as a linguist.
('81', 484, 2, 22, 860458) I know just enough of both for my public work.
('81', 484, 2, 23, 860505) But is Urdu a language distinct from Hindi as, say, Bengali is from Marathi?
('81', 484, 2, 24, 860582) Is not Urdu a direct descedant of Hindi, written in the Persian character with a tendency to borrow new words from Persian and Arabic rather than Sanskrit?

('81', 485, 1, 2, 861054) welcomed.
('81', 485, 1, 3, 861064) And when the animosities have died out, as they will one day, our descendants will laugh at our quarrels and will be proud of the common Hindustani speech which will be a mixture of words indifferently borrowed from many languages according to the tastes and equipment of its multitude of writers and speakers.
('81', 485, 1, 4, 861375) Let me correct one misimpression of my correspondent.
('81', 485, 1, 5, 861429) He seems to think that Hindustani will finally displace all the provincial languages.
('81', 485, 1, 6, 861515) That is neither my dream nor of those who have been thinking of an all India speech.
('81', 485, 1, 7, 861600) Their dream is that Hindustani should displace English which has almost become a common medium of communication between the educated classes resulting in a gulf being created between them and the masses.
('81', 485, 1, 8, 861804) The tragedy can be prevented only if the common speech spoken by the largest number of Indias inhabitants is adopted as the interprovincial speech.
('81', 485, 1, 9, 861952) The fight, therefore, is not between Hindi and Urdu, but between the two on the one hand and English on the other.
('81', 485, 1, 10, 862067) The result is a foregone conclusion in spite of the heavy handicap that the sisters are labouring under, not to speak of the temporary mutual quarrel.
('81', 485, 1, 11, 862218) My correspondent quarrels with my connection with the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan.
('81', 485, 1, 12, 862296) I am proud of my connection with that body.
('81', 485, 1, 13, 862340) It has a record of which it has no reason to be ashamed.
('81', 485, 1, 14, 862397) The name Hindi was common to both the communities.
('81', 485, 1, 15, 862448) Both have written in Hindi and promoted its growth.
('81', 485, 1, 16, 862500) Evidently my correspondent is ignorant of what my connection with that body has meant.
('81', 485, 1, 17, 862587) It was under my instigation that it wisely, and shall I say patriotically and generously, adopted the definition of Hindi to cover Urdu.
('81', 485, 1, 18, 862724) He asks whether I ever joined an Urdu Anjuman.
('81', 485, 1, 19, 862771) I have never been seriously asked to join any.
('81', 485, 1, 20, 862818) If I was, I would have made a stipulation with my inviters similar to the one I made with those who induced me to preside at the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan.
('81', 485, 1, 21, 862971) I would have asked the Urdu speaking inviters to let me ask the audience to define Urdu so as to include Hindi speech written in Devanagari script.
('81', 485, 1, 22, 863119) No such luck came my way.
('81', 485, 1, 23, 863145) But now, as I have already hinted in my article of the 1st instant already referred to, I would like to form an association advocating the learning of both forms of speech and both the scripts by its members and carrying on propaganda to that end in the hope finally of a natural fusion of the two becoming a common interprovincial speech called Hindustani.
('81', 485, 1, 24, 863503) Then the equation would be not Hindustani = Hindi + Urdu, but Hindustani = Hindi = Urdu.

('81', 486, 1, 2, 863684) 742. THE ASHRAM PRAYER 1
('81', 486, 2, 3, 863709) The Ashram prayer has become very popular.
('81', 486, 2, 4, 863752) Its development has been spontaneous.
('81', 486, 2, 5, 863790) The Ashram Bhajanavali 2 (Hymn Book) has gone into several editions and is increasingly in demand.
('81', 486, 2, 6, 863889) The birth and growth of this prayer has not been artificial.
('81', 486, 2, 7, 863950) There is a history attached to almost every shloka and every selected bhajan.
('81', 486, 2, 8, 864028) The Bhajanavali contains among others bhajans from Muslim Sufis and Fakirs, from Guru Nanak, and from the Christian Hymnary.
('81', 486, 2, 9, 864153) Every religion seems to have found a natural setting in the prayer book.
('81', 486, 2, 10, 864226) Chinese, Burmese, Jews, Ceylonese, Muslims, Parsis, Europeans and Americans have all lived in the Ashram from time to time.
('81', 486, 2, 11, 864350) In the same way two Japanese sadhus came to me in Maganwadi in 1935. One of them was with me till the other day when war broke out with Japan.
('81', 486, 2, 12, 864493) He was an ideal inmate of our home in Sevagram.
('81', 486, 2, 13, 864541) He took part in every activity with zest.
('81', 486, 2, 14, 864583) I never heard of his quarrelling with anyone.
('81', 486, 2, 15, 864629) He was a silent worker.
('81', 486, 2, 16, 864653) He learnt as much Hindi as he could.
('81', 486, 2, 17, 864690) He was a strict observer of his vows.
('81', 486, 2, 18, 864728) Every morning and evening he could be seen going round with his drum and heard chanting his mantra.
('81', 486, 2, 19, 864828) The evening worship always commenced with his mantra
('81', 486, 3, 20, 864881) , which means I bow to the Buddha, the giver of true religion. I shall never forget the quickness, the orderliness, and utter detachment with which he prepared himself the day the police came without notice to take him away from the Ashram.
('81', 486, 3, 21, 865122) He took leave of me after reciting his favourite mantra and left his drum with me.
('81', 486, 3, 22, 865205) You are leaving us, but your mantra will remain an integral part of our Ashram prayer, were the words that came spontaneously to my lips.
('81', 486, 3, 23, 865343) Since then, in spite of his absence, our morning and evening worship has commenced with the mantra.
('81', 486, 3, 24, 865443) For me it is a constant reminder of Sadhu Keshavs purity and single eyed devotion.
('81', 486, 3, 25, 865526) Indeed its efficacy lies in that sacred memory.
('81', 486, 3, 26, 865574) While Sadhu Keshav was still with us, Bibi Raihana Tyabji also came to stay at Sevagram for a few days.
('81', 486, 3, 27, 865678) I knew her to be a devout Muslim but was not aware, before the death of her illustrious father, of how well versed she was in Koran Sharif.
('81', 486, 3, 28, 865818) When that jewel of Gujarat, Tyabji Saheb, expired no sound of weeping broke the awful silence in his room.
('81', 486, 3, 29, 865925) The latter echoed with Bibi Raihanas sonorous recitation of verses from the Koran.
('81', 486, 3, 30, 866008) Such as Abbas Tyabji Saheb cannot die.

('81', 487, 2, 3, 866266) Bibi Raihana is an accomplished singer with an ample repertory of bhajans of all kinds.
('81', 487, 2, 4, 866354) She used to sing daily as well as recite beautiful verses from the Koran.
('81', 487, 2, 5, 866428) I asked her to teach some verses to any of the inmates who could learn them, and she gladly did so.
('81', 487, 2, 6, 866528) Like so many who come here she had become one of us.
('81', 487, 2, 7, 866581) Raihana went away when her visit was over, but she has left a fragrant reminder of herself.
('81', 487, 2, 8, 866673) The well known al Fateha has been included in the Ashram worship.
('81', 487, 2, 9, 866739) The following is a translation of it.
('81', 487, 2, 10, 866777) 1. I take refuge in Allah from Satan the accursed.
('81', 487, 2, 11, 866828) 2. Say : He is God, the one and only God, the Eternal, Absolute, He begetteth not nor is He begotten, And there is none like unto Him.
('81', 487, 2, 12, 866963) 3. Praise be to God, The Cherisher and Sustainer of the worlds, Most Gracious, most Merciful, Master of the Day of Judgment, Thee do we worship And Thine aid we seek.
('81', 487, 2, 13, 867130) Show us the straight way, The way of those on whom Thou hast bestowed Thy Grace, Those whose (portion) is not wrath And who go not astray.
('81', 487, 2, 14, 867269) I am writing this note in reply to an ardent Hindu friend who has thus gently reproached me : You have now given the Kalma a place in the Ashram.
('81', 487, 2, 15, 867415) What further remains to be done to kill your Hinduism? I am confident that my Hinduism and that of the other Ashram Hindus has grown thereby.
('81', 487, 2, 16, 867557) There should be in us an equal reverence for all religions.
('81', 487, 2, 17, 867617) Badshah Khan, whenever he comes, joins in the worship here with delight.
('81', 487, 2, 18, 867690) He loves the tune which the Ramayana is sung, and he listens intently to the Gita.
('81', 487, 2, 19, 867773) His faith in Islam has not lessened thereby.
('81', 487, 2, 20, 867818) Then why may I not listen to the Koran with equal reverence and adoration in my heart?
('81', 487, 3, 21, 867905) 1 The Hindi here has : On her arrival I said to Raihana jestingly, You convert the Ashram inmates to Islam.

('81', 488, 1, 4, 868206) I believe that Hindu Muslim unity will come only through such spontaneous mingling of hearts and no other.
('81', 488, 1, 5, 868313) Rama is not known by only a thousand names.
('81', 488, 1, 6, 868357) His names are innumerable, and He is the same whether we call Him Allah, Khuda, Rahim, Razaak, the Bread giver, or any name that comes from the heart of a true devotee.

('81', 489, 3, 4, 869604) JAMNALAL, Your question deserves to be considered.
('81', 489, 3, 5, 869655) Does the Goseva Sangh belong to Hinduism or is it a public institution?
('81', 489, 3, 6, 869727) If it is a public institution, then do all religions accept it, or will they?
('81', 489, 3, 7, 869805) If it is not a sectarian body, then we should try to draw to it followers of all religions.
('81', 489, 3, 8, 869897) Your list does not contain names of persons from different provinces; there is nothing like goseva in the South nor in Bengal and the Punjab.
('81', 489, 3, 9, 870039) Is no one from these places to be included?
('81', 489, 3, 10, 870083) Of late I have not come in contact with Chaunde Maharaj, but my experience of him is not quite encouraging.
('81', 489, 3, 11, 870191) He has one or two workers who are good.
('81', 489, 3, 12, 870231) My attitude is to accept from him whatever help he can give.
('81', 489, 3, 13, 870292) He has his own institution.
('81', 489, 3, 14, 870320) It should not be inter fered with.
('81', 489, 3, 15, 870355) We should learn from each other, and have a fraternal feeling.
('81', 489, 3, 16, 870418) Yes, there ought to be a woman.

('81', 490, 2, 3, 871288) HINDU MUSLIM PUZZLE
('81', 490, 3, 4, 871308) Q. In your proposed solution of the Hindu Muslim puzzle 1, do you expect all the Hindus to abstain from the legislatures or only a part?
('81', 490, 3, 5, 871445) If only a part, will not the most reactionary Hindus get in and make things worse than now?
('81', 490, 3, 6, 871537) And if you expect Congressmen to affect the Muslim mind from outside, why cant you do the same and perhaps more effectively by being inside?
('81', 490, 4, 7, 871678) A. I do not expect all the Hindus to abstain.
('81', 490, 4, 8, 871724) I know that all Hindu seats will be filled by non Congress Hindus.
('81', 490, 4, 9, 871791) Congress Hindus, if they go in, will be ground down between the two stones of the communal chakki 2 without doing any good to anybody.
('81', 490, 4, 10, 871926) I do not approach the question as a Hindu.
('81', 490, 4, 11, 871969) I approach it as a Congressman seeking to represent equally all communities.
('81', 490, 4, 12, 872046) But for the artificial system introduced in the composition of the Indian legislatures, all the members would be representing not communities but their parties grouped according to their non communal shibboleths.
('81', 490, 4, 13, 872259) As one repre senting all communities I would expect not only Hindus but Con gress minded Muslims and others too to avoid the legislatures and elective bodies.
('81', 490, 4, 14, 872418) These abstainers will hold the scales evenly between all communities and seek to affect the legislatures from outside.
('81', 490, 4, 15, 872537) Whether they are many or only a few, they will play the role of wise men.
('81', 490, 4, 16, 872611) If all listened to me, the communal question would disappear from our midst.
('81', 490, 4, 17, 872688) By entering the legislatures the Congress Hindus become inter lopers, and act weakly for fear of offending one party or the other.
('81', 490, 4, 18, 872819) This I know, that at the present moment the legislatures are, and must become, part of the war machinery.
('81', 490, 4, 19, 872925) They have no choice.
('81', 490, 4, 20, 872946) They will not be allowed to function, if they obstruct the war effort.
('81', 490, 4, 21, 873017) How could the rulers whose sole occupation is to prosecute the war do otherwise?
('81', 490, 5, 22, 873098) WHY NOT IN HINDU MAJORITY PROVINCES?
('81', 490, 6, 23, 873135) Q. Why not advise Congressmen to withdraw from the provincial legisla tures too where the Hindus are in a majority?
('81', 490, 7, 24, 873251) A. Because I do not want the non Muslim minority parties to act as if they were the majority and carry on the government in these provinces.
('81', 490, 7, 25, 873392) It would be a false position to which the Congress would be

('81', 491, 1, 3, 873596) In these provinces, therefore, abstention cannot solve the communal tangle, and will bring about an unintended and undesirable state of things.
('81', 491, 2, 4, 873740) TORTURING THE LANGUAGE?
('81', 491, 3, 5, 873764) Q. Surely you are torturing the language when you use the world unitary in the place of unilateral.
('81', 491, 3, 6, 873864) 1 For that is obviously what you mean.
('81', 491, 4, 7, 873903) A. I must plead not guilty.Unilateral has a definite legal meaning which does not fit in with what I am struggling to convey.
('81', 491, 4, 8, 874029) It is not onesidedness.
('81', 491, 4, 9, 874053) It is no sidedness.
('81', 491, 4, 10, 874073) It has impartiality implied in it.
('81', 491, 4, 11, 874108) But it is not the method of impartiality.
('81', 491, 4, 12, 874150) It is something more.
('81', 491, 4, 13, 874172) I represent a party, say, the Congress.
('81', 491, 4, 14, 874212) For the solution of the problem I apply a method whereby I seek to affect those who are estranged from me.
('81', 491, 4, 15, 874319) I am not merely impartial, because I may or may not please them.
('81', 491, 4, 16, 874384) Impartiality has to be felt by the aggrieved party.
('81', 491, 4, 17, 874436) I go the utmost length to placate the offended party, and trust my out and out pure conduct to affect them.
('81', 491, 4, 18, 874544) I may not succeed at once.
('81', 491, 4, 19, 874571) But if there is a real sense of justice in the method, it must succeed.
('81', 491, 4, 20, 874643) For want of a better word I have called the method unitary.
('81', 491, 4, 21, 874703) The dictionary meaning satisfies my test which I have imperfectly described here.

('81', 492, 1, 2, 875295) 748. DISCUSSION AT ALL INDIA GOSEVA SANGH CONFERENCE 1
('81', 492, 2, 3, 875350) February 3, 1942 2
('81', 492, 3, 4, 875369) Did Gandhiji mean to say that even as khadi saved the Indian mill cloth, the
('81', 492, 4, 5, 875446) protection of the cow would mean the protection of the buffalo?
('81', 492, 5, 6, 875510) Gandhiji said : Yes, but I mean something more.
('81', 492, 5, 7, 875558) I have often said that I should not shed a single tear, if all the mills were to be destroyed.
('81', 492, 5, 8, 875653) I would never say this regarding the buffalo.
('81', 492, 6, 9, 875699) Explaining the matter at greater length he said : No, my point is that, unless we protect the cow today, we will fail to save both the cow and the buffalo.
('81', 492, 6, 10, 875855) And it is not possible to make a combined endeavour to save both.
('81', 492, 6, 11, 875921) The combined endeavour will result in the buffalo devouring the cow.
('81', 492, 6, 12, 875990) The cow is the more neg lected animal, and that is why we should concentrate on the cow.
('81', 492, 6, 13, 876079) But not even if Jamnalalji got a few crores of rupees can we achieve our object until we have converted the people to our viewespecially the people who run goshalas and pinjrapoles.
('81', 492, 6, 14, 876261) There is no question of boycott, much less of the killing of buffaloes.
('81', 492, 6, 15, 876333) Slaughter is a thing that suggests itself easily to Western economists.
('81', 492, 6, 16, 876405) That is why they cut the Gordian knot by slaughtering the inferior breed of cows and bulls.
('81', 492, 6, 17, 876497) But that solution is not good for me.
('81', 492, 6, 18, 876535) It is my firm conviction that, if we master the real science of saving the cow, the science of saving the buffalo and other animals would automatically be revealed to us.
('81', 492, 6, 19, 876706) [Q.] But, supposing you were to boycott all the buffaloes in Sevagram, what
('81', 492, 7, 20, 876782) would happen to them and their owners?
('81', 492, 7, 21, 876821) I promise to take charge of the buffalo in case you succeed in your mission of the cow to that extent.
('81', 492, 7, 22, 876924) If the mill owners voluntarily
('81', 492, 8, 23, 876955) 1In his article Goseva SanghII, from which this is reproduced, Mahadev Desai gives the following introduction : .
('81', 492, 8, 24, 877069) no one seemed to be clear as regards the attitude to be adopted regarding the buffalo, and no one seemed to see how, if we saved the cow, the buffalo would also be saved. 2 From Bapu smaran
('81', 493, 0, 1, 877259) 494 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 493, 1, 2, 877301) close down the mills, I shall dance with joy, but not if the owners of the buffaloes were to slaughter them.
('81', 493, 1, 3, 877410) Western economics is divorced from ethics; our ethics and economics coincide or should, if they do not.
('81', 493, 1, 4, 877514) My exclusive emphasis on the protection of the cow is due to the undue neglect of the cow although she in my opinion is a sound economic proposition.
('81', 493, 1, 5, 877664) I do not need the aid of the Vedas to show me this, and this is a matter in which I would test the Vedic precept on the anvil of reason.
('81', 493, 1, 6, 877801) Reason convinces me that if I save the cow I save the cow and the buffalo both.
('81', 493, 1, 7, 877881) If anyone can convince me that the cow is dead beyond redemption, and that the buffalo alone needs to be protected, I am quite prepared to organize a Buffalo Protection Association.
('81', 493, 1, 8, 878063) But the reverse is the case.
('81', 493, 1, 9, 878092) The buffalo needs no special protection, the cow needs it.
('81', 493, 1, 10, 878151) The buffalo and the goat are as much my mothers as the cow.
('81', 493, 1, 11, 878211) But I know that the poor goat cannot be saved, that the cow badly needs to be saved, and when we have saved the cow the buffalo will be automatically saved.
('81', 493, 2, 12, 878368) Gandhiji tentatively suggested that co operative owning of cows and co operative owning of pasture for them would go a great length in improving both the breed and the milk yield and in helping to solve the question of grazing.
('81', 493, 3, 13, 878596) For the next year the Goseva Sangh should, suggested Gandhiji, concentrate on making cows milk available throughout Wardha and its neighbourhood, on sending experts to pinjrapoles in order to collect material, throw out suggestions, and help in making them approximate to the ideal pinjrapole contemplated by the Sangh, and on having a laboratory in Wardha for the testing of milk and ghee, and so on.
('81', 493, 3, 14, 878998) The Sangh will also try to enlist at least a thousand members.

('81', 494, 2, 3, 879249) Correspondents will please note that I neither open nor read all the correspondence that comes to me.
('81', 494, 2, 4, 879351) And now that I have taken up the care of the three weeklies, the fewest possible letters are put before me, and even those I often do not get the time to read.
('81', 494, 2, 5, 879511) Correspondents should regard the weeklies as my public letter to them.
('81', 494, 2, 6, 879582) Therefore they may not as a rule expect personal replies.
('81', 494, 2, 7, 879640) Many apply for admission to the Sevagram Ashram.
('81', 494, 2, 8, 879689) For one thing there is hardly room for further admissions.
('81', 494, 2, 9, 879748) Some insist on replies in my own hand.
('81', 494, 2, 10, 879787) It is not possible to satisfy this desire, much as I should like to.
('81', 494, 2, 11, 879856) I would therefore request all correspondents to spare me and my overworked assistants as much as possible.

('81', 495, 6, 17, 881522) You may talk to me only if you feel like it.
('81', 495, 6, 18, 881567) Otherwise, at least meet the others.
('81', 495, 6, 19, 881604) Look into the hospital affairs.
('81', 495, 6, 20, 881636) Give necessary instructions to Shankaran.
('81', 495, 6, 21, 881678) Examine my health so that you may know.
('81', 495, 6, 22, 881718) Otherwise at the moment we are oscillating between yes and no.
('81', 495, 6, 23, 881781) Let it be so.
('81', 495, 6, 24, 881795) If you come only for a day or two, you may not like to inter fere in the routine fixed by me.
('81', 495, 6, 25, 881889) If you decide to stay on here, you will consider my conditions and I shall consider yours.
('81', 495, 6, 26, 881980) We shall try to find some solution or shall put up with our differences.
('81', 495, 6, 27, 882053) You could attend to my work from a distance.
('81', 495, 6, 28, 882098) For the moment I would only ask you to come here without any protest.

('81', 496, 4, 11, 883297) BHAI VALLABHBHAI, I have been intending to write to you for some time, when, lo and behold, today I got your letter.
('81', 496, 4, 12, 883414) Do try and arrange to get uncooked vegetables from somewhere.
('81', 496, 4, 13, 883476) The experiment has benefited me greatly.
('81', 496, 4, 14, 883517) I have, therefore, advised Ghanshyamdas to make the same experiment and have him put on four ounces of butter.
('81', 496, 4, 15, 883628) This has increased his energy and strength.
('81', 496, 4, 16, 883672) Please do not, therefore, give up the experiment.
('81', 496, 4, 17, 883722) If you keep the leaves immersed in salt water solution, they will remain fresh.
('81', 496, 4, 18, 883802) It will be enough if you eat only four or five of these.
('81', 496, 4, 19, 883859) But you can eat onions, carrot, knoll cole, radish, etc., even after two or more days.
('81', 496, 4, 20, 883946) You need not take more than two ounces in all.
('81', 496, 4, 21, 883993) The rest is all right.
('81', 496, 4, 22, 884016) I am writing to Prithvi Singh.

('81', 496, 4, 25, 884075) I will train him further here and then let him go.
('81', 496, 4, 26, 884126) He may then utilize your help.
('81', 496, 4, 27, 884157) He is indeed a good man.
('81', 496, 4, 28, 884182) He is a little immature, but will learn here.
('81', 496, 4, 29, 884228) You may send for him if you need him again.
('81', 496, 4, 30, 884272) Please take it that the adhesions in your intestines can be cured only through a carefully selected diet.
('81', 496, 4, 31, 884378) You should not strain at all when passing stools.
('81', 496, 4, 32, 884428) I understand your eagerness to get Mahadev over there.
('81', 496, 4, 33, 884483) But he cannot look after Harijan properly from there.
('81', 496, 4, 34, 884537) He would naturally like to show me what he writes and I to see it.
('81', 496, 4, 35, 884604) After reading what he writes I often find it necessary to make some essential, though only a few, changes.

('81', 499, 2, 3, 887590) [Before February 8, 1942] 2
('81', 499, 3, 4, 887618) Gandhiji laughingly said : I will not accept the messages, unless Dr. Carver 3 comes and delivers them himself.
('81', 499, 4, 5, 887730) Dr. John said Dr. Carver was too old now to come to India.
('81', 499, 4, 6, 887789) But he .
('81', 499, 4, 7, 887798) remembers Gandhiji whenever he has an Indian visitor.
('81', 499, 4, 8, 887852) The very first question that Gandhiji asked Dr. John about Dr. Carver was : But even this genius suffers under the handicap of segregation, does not he?
('81', 499, 5, 9, 888005) Oh yes, as much as any Negro.
('81', 499, 5, 10, 888035) And yet these people talk of democracy and equality !
('81', 499, 5, 11, 888089) It is an utter lie.
('81', 499, 6, 12, 888109) But Dr. Carver is never bitter or resentful.
('81', 499, 6, 13, 888154) I know, that is what we believers in non violence have to learn from him.
('81', 499, 6, 14, 888228) But what about the claim of these people who are said to be fighting for democracy?

('81', 500, 3, 6, 888840) You may occupy a column of Harijan every week.
('81', 500, 3, 7, 888887) You should give me a plan for the use of the threatened plot of land.
('81', 500, 3, 8, 888957) The quicker the better.

('81', 500, 6, 12, 889078) MISBEHAVIOUR OF TROOPS
('81', 500, 7, 13, 889101) I have piteous letters from correspondents complaining of misbehaviour by troops, white and Indian.
('81', 500, 7, 14, 889201) There are detailed letters from Dohad and Rutlam stations and others too.
('81', 500, 7, 15, 889275) The troops are said to have molested the hawkers on the platforms, helped themselves to eatables and hit the salesmen who protested.
('81', 500, 7, 16, 889408) The station masters were powerless to afford protection.
('81', 500, 7, 17, 889465) I do not know how much credit is to be attached to the descriptions I have received.
('81', 500, 7, 18, 889550) The evidence is so detailed and given with so much moderation as to command belief.
('81', 500, 7, 19, 889634) Anyway I draw the attention of the authorities to the complaints.
('81', 500, 7, 20, 889700) Any such misbehaviour should be put down summarily and repetition made practically impossible, If panic is to be prevented and bitterness avoided.
('81', 500, 7, 21, 889847) I would advise the aggrieved parties to lodge their complaints to the proper authorities with authentic evidence in support.
('81', 500, 8, 22, 889972) HYDERABAD STATE
('81', 500, 9, 23, 889988) Swami Ramanand Tirtha of the banned State Congress has issued the following sober statement 2 :
('81', 500, 10, 24, 890084) 1 Jairamdas Doulatram 2 Of which only extracts are reproduced here
('81', 501, 0, 1, 890151) 502 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 501, 1, 2, 890193) Some of the workers of the Hyderabad State Congress which was banned on 2nd March, 1940, offered individual satygraha in the month of September 1940. .
('81', 501, 1, 3, 890345) The Government of H.E.H. the Nizam released them unconditionally on 16th December, 1941. Immediately after the release, I issued a statement saying.
('81', 501, 1, 4, 890494) that it was incumbent upon us to continue the satyagraha till our demend for lifting the ban was conceded by the Government.
('81', 501, 1, 5, 890619) After our release we consulted Mahatmaji and.
('81', 501, 1, 6, 890665) he advised us to abstain from re offering satyagraha at this hour, and directed us to concentrate our energies wholly on the constructive programme.
('81', 501, 1, 7, 890814) We therefore appeal to the people in general and workers in particular to devote their energies to this programme.
('81', 501, 1, 8, 890929) This suspension, however, does not mean any alteration in our goal which is the attainment of responsible government under the aegis of H.E.H. the Nizam and the Asafjahi Dynasty.
('81', 501, 1, 9, 891108) How I wish the Government of H. E. H. the Nizam would remove the ban.
('81', 501, 1, 10, 891178) They cannot wish to prevent people from carrying on a constitutional movement in favour of responsible government under the aegis of H. E. H. the Nizam.
('81', 501, 1, 11, 891331) The recent release of the satyagrahis loses all grace if the ban on the State Congress is not removed.

('81', 501, 2, 13, 891480) 761. NOT NECESSARILY IMPURE
('81', 501, 3, 14, 891508) Thus writes Shri Shankerrao Dev:
('81', 501, 4, 15, 891541) In the last issue of Harijan, in your article A Deplorable Incident 1 you say to the rich: Earn your crores by all means.
('81', 501, 4, 16, 891663) But understand that your wealth is not yours; it belongs to the people.
('81', 501, 4, 17, 891735) Take what you require for your legitimate needs, and use the remainder for society. When I read this, the first question that arose in my mind was: Why first earn crores and then use them for society? As society today is constituted the means of earning crores are bound to be impure; and one who earns crores by impure means cannot be expected to follow the mantra  because in the very process of earning crores by impure means the mans character is bound to be tainted or vitiated.
('81', 501, 4, 18, 892219) And moreover you have always been emphasizing the purity of means.
('81', 501, 4, 19, 892286) But I am afraid that there is a possibility of people misunderstanding that you are laying an emphasis here more on the ends than on the means.
('81', 501, 5, 20, 892430) I request you to emphasize as much, if not more, on the purity of means of earning money as on spending.
('81', 501, 5, 21, 892535) If purity of means is strictly observed, then, according to me, crores could not be accumulated at all and the difficulty of
('81', 501, 6, 22, 892660) 1 Vide A Deplorable Incident, 25 1 1942.
('81', 502, 0, 1, 892701) VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 503
('81', 502, 1, 2, 892748) spending for society will assume a very minor prospect.
('81', 502, 1, 3, 892804) I must demur.
('81', 502, 1, 4, 892818) Surely a man may conceivable make crores through strictly pure means, assuming that a man may legitimately possess riches.
('81', 502, 1, 5, 892941) For the purpose of my argument, I have assumed that private possession itself is not held to be impure.
('81', 502, 1, 6, 893045) If I own a mining lease and I tumble upon a diamond of rare value, I may suddenly find myself a millionaire without being held guilty of having used impure means.
('81', 502, 1, 7, 893208) This actually happened when Cullinan diamond, much more valuable than the Kohinoor, was found.
('81', 502, 1, 8, 893303) Such instances can be easily multiplied.
('81', 502, 1, 9, 893344) My argument was surely addressed to such men.
('81', 502, 1, 10, 893390) I have no hesitation in endorsing the proposition that generally rich men and for that matter most men are not particular as to the way they make money.
('81', 502, 1, 11, 893543) In the application of the method of non violence one must believe in the possibility of every person, however depraved, being reformed under humane and skilled treatment.
('81', 502, 1, 12, 893714) We must appeal to the good in human beings and expect response.
('81', 502, 1, 13, 893778) Is it not conducive to the well being of society that every member uses all his talents, only not for personal aggrandisement but for the good of all?
('81', 502, 1, 14, 893929) We do not want to produce dead equality where every person becomes or is rendered incapable of using his ability to the utmost possible extent.
('81', 502, 1, 15, 894073) Such a society must ultimately perish.
('81', 502, 1, 16, 894112) I therefore suggest that my advice that monied men may earn their crores (honestly only, of course) but so as to dedicate them to the service of all is perfectly sound
('81', 502, 2, 17, 894280)  is a mantra based on uncommon knowledge.
('81', 502, 2, 18, 894322) It is the surest method to evolve a new order or life of universal benefit in the place of the present one where each one lives for himself without regard to what happens to his neighbour.

('81', 502, 3, 20, 894557) 762. INDIVIDUAL OR COLLECTIVE?
('81', 502, 4, 21, 894588) Shri Jamnalal Bajaj has bravely taken the burden of the great work of cow service (in other words, cattle preservation) on his shoulders.
('81', 502, 4, 22, 894726) The most important question for consideration before the recent Goseva Sangh Conference 2 was whether cow farming should be in the hands of individuals or done collectively.
('81', 502, 4, 23, 894900) I myself had no hesitaton in saying that she could never be saved by individual
('81', 502, 5, 24, 894980) 1 The Hindi original of this appeared in Harijan Sevak, 15 2 1942. 2 Held on February 1, 1942
('81', 503, 0, 1, 895074) 504 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 503, 1, 2, 895116) farming.
('81', 503, 1, 3, 895125) Her salvation, and with her that of the buffalo, could only be brought about by collective endeavour.
('81', 503, 1, 4, 895227) It is quite impossible for an individual farmer to look after the welfare of his cattle in his own home in a proper and scientific manner.
('81', 503, 1, 5, 895366) Amongst other causes lack of collective effort has been a principal cause of the deterioration of the cow and hence of cattle in general.
('81', 503, 2, 6, 895504) The world today is moving towards the ideal of collective or co operative effort in every department of life.
('81', 503, 2, 7, 895614) Much in this line has been and is being accomplished.
('81', 503, 2, 8, 895668) It has come into our country also, but in such a distorted form that our poor have not been able to reap its benefits.
('81', 503, 2, 9, 895787) Pari passu with the increase in our popultion land holdings of the average farmer are daily decreasing.
('81', 503, 2, 10, 895891) Moreover, what the individual possesses is often fragmentary.
('81', 503, 2, 11, 895953) 2 For such farmers to keep cattle in their homes is a suicidal policy; and yet this is their condition today.
('81', 503, 2, 12, 896063) Those who give the first place to economics and pay scant attention to religious, ethical or humanitarian considerations proclaim from the house tops that the farmer is being devoured by his cattle due to the cost of their feed which is out of all proporation to what they yield.
('81', 503, 2, 13, 896343) They say it is folly not to slaughter wholesale all useless animals.
('81', 503, 2, 14, 896412) What then should be done by humanitarians is the question.
('81', 503, 2, 15, 896471) The answer obviously is to find a way whereby we may not only save the lives of our cattle but also see that do not become a burden.
('81', 503, 2, 16, 896604) I am sure that co operative effort can help us in a large measure.
('81', 503, 2, 17, 896671) The following comparison may be helpful: 1. Under the collective system no farmer can keep cattle in his house as he does today.
('81', 503, 2, 18, 896800) They foul the air and dirty the surroundings.
('81', 503, 2, 19, 896846) There is neither intelligence nor humanitarianism in living with animals.
('81', 503, 2, 20, 896920) Man was not meant to do so.
('81', 503, 2, 21, 896948) The space taken up by the cattle today would be spared to the farmer and his family if the collective system were adopted.
('81', 503, 2, 22, 897071) 2. As the number of cattle increases, life becomes impossible for the farmer in his home.
('81', 503, 2, 23, 897161) Hence he is obliged to sell the calves and kill the male buffaloes or else turn them out to starve and die.
('81', 503, 2, 24, 897269) This inhumanity would be averted, if the care of cattle were undertaken on
('81', 503, 3, 25, 897344) 1 The Hindi here adds: This burden is no doubt beyond the strength of an individual farmer. 2 The Hindi here adds: And whatever little he has only adds to his pro blems.

('81', 504, 1, 2, 897561) a co operative basis.
('81', 504, 1, 3, 897583) 3. Collective cattle farming would ensure the supply of veterinary treatment to animals when they are ill.
('81', 504, 1, 4, 897690) No ordinary farmer can afford this on his own.
('81', 504, 1, 5, 897737) 4. Similarly one selected bull can be easily kept for the need of several cows under the collective system.
('81', 504, 1, 6, 897845) This is impossible otherwise except for charity.
('81', 504, 1, 7, 897894) 5. Common grazing ground or land for exercising the animals will be easily available under the co operative system, whereas today generally there is nothing of the kind for individual farmers.
('81', 504, 1, 8, 898087) 6. The expense on fodder will be comparatively far less under the collective system.
('81', 504, 1, 9, 898172) 7. The sale of milk at good prices will be greatly facilitated, and there will be no need or temptation for the farmer to adulterate it as he does as an individual.
('81', 504, 1, 10, 898337) 8. It is impossible to carry out tests of the fitness of every head of cattle individually, but this could easily be done for the cattle of a whole village and would thus make it easier to improve the breed.
('81', 504, 1, 11, 898545) 9. The foregoing advantages should be sufficient argument in favour of co operative cattle farming.
('81', 504, 1, 12, 898645) The strongest argument in its favour is that the individualistic system has been the means of making our own condition as well as that of our cattle pitiable.
('81', 504, 1, 13, 898804) We can only save ourselves and them by making this essential change.
('81', 504, 1, 14, 898873) I firmly believe too that we shall not derive the full benefits of agriculture until we take to co operative farming.
('81', 504, 1, 15, 898991) Does it not stand to reason that it is far better for a hundred families in a village to cultivate their lands collectively and divide the income therefrom than to divide the land anyhow into a hundred portions?
('81', 504, 1, 16, 899203) And what applies to land applies equally to cattle.
('81', 504, 1, 17, 899255) It is quite another matter that it may be difficult to convert people to adopt this way of life straightaway.
('81', 504, 1, 18, 899365) The straight and narrow road is always hard to traverse.
('81', 504, 1, 19, 899422) Every step in the programme of cow service is strewn with thorny problems.
('81', 504, 1, 20, 899497) But only by surmounting difficulties can we hope to make the path easier.
('81', 504, 1, 21, 899571) My purpose for the time being is to show the great superiority of collective cattle farming over the individual effort.
('81', 504, 1, 22, 899691) I hold further that the latter is wrong and the former only is right.
('81', 504, 1, 23, 899761) In reality even the individual can only safeguard his independence through co operation.
('81', 504, 1, 24, 899850) In cattle farming the individual effort has led to selfishness and inhumanity, whereas the
('81', 505, 0, 1, 899941) 506 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 505, 1, 2, 899983) collective effort can abate both the evils, if it does not remove them altogether.

('81', 505, 6, 9, 900443) DEAR LORD LINLITHGOW, As I have suspended civil disobedience, I make bold to write this letter for humanitys cause.
('81', 505, 6, 10, 900559) The statutory law says that charitable institutions, though they make profits, are free from income tax.
('81', 505, 6, 11, 900664) I am the founder and Presi dent of the All India Spinners Association.
('81', 505, 6, 12, 900735) I can give you my word that it is a purely charitable association.
('81', 505, 6, 13, 900802) It exists to serve the poorest in the land through hand spinning and hand weaving.
('81', 505, 6, 14, 900885) But simply through legal quibbles, disbelief of the evidence tendered and, I apprehend, for its connection with the Congress in that it got its charter from the Congress, the officials have decided do levy the income tax.
('81', 505, 6, 15, 901107) The profit are not denied but they have never been used for private or personal gain.
('81', 505, 6, 16, 901193) The whole of the Executive of the Association is honorary.
('81', 505, 6, 17, 901252) The Association has gone to the High Court of Bombay which has thrown out its petition on a legal flaw.
('81', 505, 6, 18, 901356) It is appealing to the Privy Council.
('81', 505, 6, 19, 901394) I do not know what will be the result.
('81', 505, 6, 20, 901433) Meanwhile the Association has already paid a certain amount of the tax and is likely to be called upon to pay up to five lacs.
('81', 505, 6, 21, 901560) They will not stay the levy pending the proceedings.
('81', 505, 6, 22, 901613) But my request is for you to intervene and save the five lacs for the poor.
('81', 505, 6, 23, 901689) Let me tell you that during the past 20 years of its existence the Association has distri

('81', 506, 1, 3, 901877) I am not burdening you with further facts or any papers.
('81', 506, 1, 4, 901934) You can have these for the asking.

('81', 506, 2, 15, 902898) But you must be in the A.I.V.I.A. as also in the A.I.S.A. if you are not in the latter.
('81', 506, 2, 16, 902986) Hope you are flourishing and following what I write in Harijan.
('81', 506, 2, 17, 903050) I wish you, Devi 3 and Premi 4 will make up your Hindi and Urdu.
('81', 506, 2, 18, 903115) How high would Premi have gone if she had given one quarter of the years to Hindi and Urdu just as she has given to English.
('81', 506, 2, 19, 903240) The knowledge then gained would have flown to the masses.
('81', 506, 2, 20, 903298) Now it is dammed and damned too.

('81', 507, 5, 6, 903660) The Working Committee have received the following letter from Gandhiji and recognize the validity of the point he has raised and therefore relieve him of the responsibility laid upon him by the Bombay Resolution referred to by Gandhiji.
('81', 507, 5, 7, 903897) But the Committee assure him that the policy of non violence adopted under his guidance for the attainment of swaraj and which has proved so successful in leading to mass awakening and otherwise will be adhered to by the Congress.
('81', 507, 5, 8, 904128) The Working Committee further assure him that it would like to extend its scope as far as possible even in free India.
('81', 507, 5, 9, 904247) The Committee hope that Congressmen will render him full assistance in the prosecution of his mission, including the offering of civil disobedience.

('81', 507, 8, 13, 904518) December 30, 1941
('81', 507, 9, 14, 904536) Fourteen months have elapsed since the Working Committee held their last meeting and during this period the world has fallen ever deeper into the abyss of war and rushed headlong towards self destruction.
('81', 507, 9, 15, 904741) The members of the Committee have met again on their release from prison and given earnest thought to all the national and international developments during this fateful period of human history.
('81', 507, 9, 16, 904936) The burden of guiding the Congress and the nation at this critical stage, when old problems assume a new significance and war approaches the frontiers of India bringing new problems in its train, is a heavy one which the Committtee can only shoulder worthily with the full co operation of the people of India.
('81', 507, 9, 17, 905246) The Committee have endeavoured to keep in view the principles and objectives for which the Congress has stood during these past many years and considered them in the larger context of world conditions and world freedom.
('81', 507, 9, 18, 905466) The Committee are convinced that full

('81', 508, 1, 2, 905826) freedom for the people of India is essential even, and more especially, in the present state of world turmoil, not only for Indias sake but for the sake of the world.
('81', 508, 1, 3, 905993) The Committee also hold that real peace and freedom can only be established and endured on the basis of world co operation between free nations.
('81', 508, 2, 4, 906138) The Committee gave full expression to their attitude towards the war in their statement issued on September 14, 1939, 1 wherein they condemned Nazi and Fascist aggression and expressed their willingness to help the cause of freedom and democracy, provided the objectives of the war were clearly stated and acted upon, in so far as was possible, in the present.
('81', 508, 2, 5, 906499) If freedom and democracy were those objectives, then they must necessarily include the ending of imperialism and the recognition of the independence of India.
('81', 508, 2, 6, 906658) Subsequent pronouncements made on behalf of the British Government and their reactionary and oppressive policy made it clear that this Government was determined to maintain and intensify its imperialist hold and exploitation of the Indian people.
('81', 508, 2, 7, 906905) British policy was one of deliberate insult to Indian nationalism of a perpetuation of unrestrained authoritarianism and the encouragement of disruptive and reactionary elements.
('81', 508, 2, 8, 907084) Not only has every offer made by the Congress for an honourable compromise been rejected, but public opinion voiced by organizations regarded as moderate has also been flouted.
('81', 508, 3, 9, 907261) The Congress was, therefore, compelled, in order to defend the honour and the elementary rights of the Indian people and the integrity of the nationalist movement, to request Gandhiji to guide the Congress in the action that should be taken.
('81', 508, 3, 10, 907503) Mahatma Gandhi desirous of avoiding embarrassment to his opponent as far as possible, especially during the perils and dangers of war, limited the satyagraha movement which he started to selected individuals who conformed to certain tests he had laid down.
('81', 508, 3, 11, 907760) That satyagraha has now proceeded for over fourteen months and about twenty five thousand Congressmen have suffered imprisonment, while many thousands of others who offered satyagraha in the Frontier Province and elsewhere were not arrested.
('81', 508, 3, 12, 908002) The committee desire to express their respectful appreciation of Gandhijis leadership and of the response of the nation to it, and are of opinion that this has strengthened the people.
('81', 508, 4, 13, 908187) Throughout this period the attitude of the British Government has been hostile to Indian freedom and it has functioned in India as a completely authoritarian government, insulting the deeply cherished convictions and feelings of the people.
('81', 508, 4, 14, 908428) Neither the professions of freedom and democracy nor the perils and catastrophes that have come in the wake of war have affected this attitude and policy, and such changes as have taken place have been for the worse.
('81', 508, 5, 15, 908645) The recent release of a number of political prisoners has no significance or importance, and the circumstances attending it, and official pronouncements made,

('81', 509, 0, 1, 908860) 510 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 509, 1, 2, 908902) make it clear that it is not connected with any change of policy.
('81', 509, 1, 3, 908968) Large numbers of detenus, who are kept in prison under the Defence of India Act without trial, and whose only offence seems to be that they are ardent patriots impatient of foreign rule and determined to achieve the independence of the country, still remain in prison.
('81', 509, 1, 4, 909237) Recent arrests of prominent persons and their treatment in prison also indicate that the old policy is being pursued as before.
('81', 509, 2, 5, 909365) While there has been no change in Britains policy towards India, the Working Committee must nevertheless take into full consideration the new world situation that has arisen by the development of the war into a world conflict and its approach to India.
('81', 509, 2, 6, 909618) The sympathies of the Congress must inevitably lie with the people who are the subject of aggression and who are fighting for their freedom.
('81', 509, 2, 7, 909759) But only a free and independent India can be in a position to undertake the defence of the country on a national basis and be of help in the furtherance of the larger causes that are emerging from the storm of war.
('81', 509, 2, 8, 909974) The whole background in India is one of hostility and of distrust of the British Government and not even the most far reaching promises can alter this background, nor can a subject India offer voluntary or willing help to an arrogant imperialism which is indistinguishable from Fascist authoritarianism.
('81', 509, 3, 9, 910278) The Committee is, therefore, of opinion that the resolution 1 of the A. I. C. C. passed in Bombay on September 16, 1940, holds today and defines Congress policy still.

('81', 509, 6, 13, 910531) CONGRESS WORKING COMMITTEES INSTRUCTIONS 2
('81', 509, 7, 14, 910574) This meeting of the A. I. C. C. endorses the following instructions issued by
('81', 509, 8, 15, 910652) the Working Committee and calls upon all Provincial and other subordinate Congress
('81', 509, 9, 16, 910735) Committees to give effect to them within their respective areas.
('81', 509, 9, 17, 910800) The Provincial
('81', 509, 10, 18, 910815) Congress Committees are authorized to supplement them wherever necessary.
('81', 509, 11, 19, 910889) Committee expects every member of an elective Congress Committee to devote
('81', 509, 12, 20, 910964) himself actively to the execution of some item of this programme, and to send
('81', 509, 13, 21, 911042) periodical reports of the work done by him to his Committee :
('81', 509, 14, 22, 911104) Recent developments in the world situation have brought war near to Indias
('81', 509, 15, 23, 911179) frontiers.
('81', 509, 15, 24, 911190) This may lead to internal dislocation in certain parts of the country and

('81', 510, 1, 2, 911442) there is a possibility of some cities being subjected to aerial attack.
('81', 510, 1, 3, 911514) Whatever
('81', 510, 2, 4, 911523) dangers and difficulties might arise, the real antidote to them is to remain cool and
('81', 510, 3, 5, 911609) collected and on no account to give way to nervousness and excitements.
('81', 510, 4, 6, 911681) Congressmen must remain at their posts and continue their service of the people;
('81', 510, 5, 7, 911762) wherever necessity arises they should yield places of safety to those in greater need
('81', 510, 6, 8, 911848) and be ready to render aid to those who may require it.
('81', 510, 7, 9, 911904) The Congress can help and serve the people in the difficult times ahead only if
('81', 510, 8, 10, 911984) its organization is strong and disciplined and Congressmen individually and
('81', 510, 9, 11, 912060) Congress Committees are able to command confidence in their respective localities.
('81', 510, 10, 12, 912143) Congress Committees and Congressmen should therefore address themselves
('81', 510, 11, 13, 912215) immediately to the task of strengthening the organization and reviving and
('81', 510, 12, 14, 912290) maintaining contacts with the people in the villages and towns.
('81', 510, 12, 15, 912354) Every village
('81', 510, 13, 16, 912368) should, as far as possible, receive the message of the Congress and be prepared to face
('81', 510, 14, 17, 912456) such difficulties as might arise.
('81', 510, 15, 18, 912490) The constructive programme adopted by the Congress, and explained from
('81', 510, 16, 19, 912561) time to time by Gandhiji, is of particular importance at this juncture.
('81', 510, 16, 20, 912633) It is meant not
('81', 510, 17, 21, 912649) only to bring about unity among various groups, to remove disabilities which keep
('81', 510, 18, 22, 912731) sections of the community backward and depressed, to promote self reliance and the
('81', 510, 19, 23, 912814) co operative spirit among the people, to increase production and have fairer
('81', 510, 20, 24, 912891) distribution but it also furnishes the best opportunity and means of contacts with the
('81', 510, 21, 25, 912978) people and service to them which are necessary for winning their confidence.
('81', 510, 22, 26, 913055) Working Committee therefore call upon Congress Committees and workers to further
('81', 510, 23, 27, 913136) this programme intensively, and thus exercise a steadying and strengthening
('81', 510, 24, 28, 913212) influence in times of dislocation and uneasiness.
('81', 510, 25, 29, 913262) During such times there is always a possibility of trouble being created by un 
('81', 510, 26, 30, 913342) social elements in the country.
('81', 510, 26, 31, 913374) To avoid the emergence of such a situation and to meet
('81', 510, 27, 32, 913429) it when it arises, volunteers should be organized in both the urban and rural areas.
('81', 510, 28, 33, 913514) Such organizations should be formed on the basis of strict non violence, and it
('81', 510, 29, 34, 913594) should always be remembered that the Congress adheres to this principle.
('81', 510, 30, 35, 913667) volunteers may co operate with other organizations working for other ends, this
('81', 510, 31, 36, 913747) volunteer organization is meant for rendering service to the people both normally
('81', 510, 32, 37, 913829) and in the event of possible internal commotion.
('81', 510, 32, 38, 913878) It should therefore avoid conflict
('81', 510, 33, 39, 913913) with the authorities.
('81', 510, 34, 40, 913935) Prices of commodities have already risen and are causing distress among the
('81', 510, 35, 41, 914011) people and no adequate steps have so far been taken by the authorities to meet this
('81', 510, 36, 42, 914095) situation.
('81', 510, 36, 43, 914106) These tendencies are likely to be accentuated in the future, and dislocation
('81', 511, 0, 1, 914183) 512 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('81', 511, 1, 2, 914225) of trade and transport, due to stress of war, may lead to scarcity of the necessaries of
('81', 511, 2, 3, 914314) life as well as of many other things which are of everyday use.
('81', 511, 2, 4, 914378) Big scale industries in
('81', 511, 3, 5, 914402) other countries have suffered heavily on account of the war, and transport of goods
('81', 511, 4, 6, 914486) has become difficult on account of military requirements.
('81', 511, 4, 7, 914544) China has largely overcome
('81', 511, 5, 8, 914571) these difficulties by a widespread development of village industries.
('81', 511, 5, 9, 914641) India may have
('81', 511, 6, 10, 914656) to face similar problems, and village and cottage industries afford a solution,
('81', 511, 7, 11, 914736) desirable in itself, and more particularly, suited to the needs of the moment.
('81', 511, 8, 12, 914815) industries can escape to a large extent the effects of dislocation of trade and transport.
('81', 511, 9, 13, 914906) It is therefore necessary that this item of the constructive programme should be
('81', 511, 10, 14, 914987) widely taken up and worked up with vigour and earnestness so that the countryside
('81', 511, 11, 15, 915069) may be rendered, as far as possible, self sufficient in regard to the necessaries of life.
('81', 511, 12, 16, 915160) The Committee would specially recommend to the villagers the growing of food crops
('81', 511, 13, 17, 915243) at least to cover the needs of the village and appeal to the grain dealers not to hold up
('81', 511, 14, 18, 915333) stores for profit but release them for consumption at fair prices.
('81', 511, 15, 19, 915400) In cases of emergency, when instructions are issued to the public by the
('81', 511, 16, 20, 915473) authorities for the preservation of life and property and the maintenance of public
('81', 511, 17, 21, 915557) order, Congressmen should avoid conflict with the authorities.
('81', 511, 17, 22, 915620) They should carry out
('81', 511, 18, 23, 915642) such instructions, unless they are contrary to Congress directions.
