('8', 0, 1, 2, 43) 1. LATE MR. ARATHOON
('8', 0, 2, 3, 64) The mail last week brought the sad news of Mr. Arathoons death.
('8', 0, 2, 4, 128) Mr. Arathoon in his capacity as the honorary secretary of the East India Association served it for a number of years faithfully and well.
('8', 0, 2, 5, 266) As Editor of The Asiatic Quarterly Review, his work is known to all who have any connection with India.
('8', 0, 2, 6, 370) But he is best known to Indians in South Africa for his very great sympathy for them and the constant attention he gave to the question in connection with the Association, with which he was so closely identified.
('8', 0, 2, 7, 583) He never missed an opportunity of bringing it to the notice of the Association, and thereby to that of the authorities.
('8', 0, 2, 8, 703) He rendered very valuable assistance to the deputation last year by his whole hearted co operation.
('8', 0, 2, 9, 803) We tender our condolences to Mr. Arathoons family.

('8', 0, 3, 11, 881) 2. VOLKSRUST CASES
('8', 0, 4, 12, 900) The cases instituted in Volksrust against Mr. Mahomed Essak and other Indians deserve attention.
('8', 0, 4, 13, 997) Originally, it was the intention of the Government to frame the charge under the new law, but it lost nerve at the last moment and the case was brought up under the Peace Preservation Ordinance.
('8', 0, 4, 14, 1192) Mr. Mahomed Essak having taken the lead, others too could follow.
('8', 0, 4, 15, 1258) He has saved the honour of the Konkanis.
('8', 0, 4, 16, 1299) No one would now be justified in blaming the Konkanis.
('8', 0, 4, 17, 1354) The magistrate discharged Mr. Mahomed Essak, holding that he was entitled under his permit to reside in the Colony.
('8', 0, 4, 18, 1470) These cases have brought out the courage of the people.
('8', 0, 4, 19, 1526) It was good that no bail was offered.
('8', 0, 4, 20, 1564) It was also good that those arrested included people from all communities.
('8', 0, 4, 21, 1639) This case reveals the extreme weakness of the Government.
('8', 0, 4, 22, 1697) The Government is demoralized.
('8', 0, 4, 23, 1728) It does not know what to do.
('8', 0, 4, 24, 1757) Its condition is like that of an angry man who has started raving.
('8', 0, 4, 25, 1824) It would be to our advantage if there were still more cases like this.
('8', 0, 4, 26, 1895) If the Government were really strong, it would arrest the people in the Transvaal who are opposing the law.
('8', 0, 4, 27, 2003) That it is not able to do.
('8', 0, 4, 28, 2030) Hence it is trying desperately to stop the people from coming from outside.
('8', 0, 4, 29, 2106) The Government cannot but be defeated in such an attempt.
('8', 0, 4, 30, 2164) For, there is a big loophole in the new law.

('8', 1, 1, 2, 2292) 3. NATAL LICENSING ACT
('8', 1, 2, 3, 2315) Under this Act, the Government has made new regulations which include three remarkable sections.
('8', 1, 2, 4, 2412) First, from now on the application for a licence will have to be published in a newspaper.
('8', 1, 2, 5, 2503) The officer will have the right to take a thumb impression on the application.
('8', 1, 2, 6, 2582) Finally, one will have to pay 12.10.0 when making an appeal.
('8', 1, 2, 7, 2643) All this is bad, but one must consider on what point relief is possible.
('8', 1, 2, 8, 2716) It does not appear likely that the requirement to have the application published in a newspaper will be cancelled.
('8', 1, 2, 9, 2831) There is such a law in the Cape.
('8', 1, 2, 10, 2864) Taking of a thumb impression is left to the discretion of the officer.
('8', 1, 2, 11, 2935) This can be interpreted to mean that those who can sign will not be required to give thumb impressions.
('8', 1, 2, 12, 3039) We cannot advise making any petition to the Government on either of these two points, for it will be useless to do so.
('8', 1, 2, 13, 3158) The obligation to pay 12.10.0 is not a new thing.
('8', 1, 2, 14, 3208) There is only one remedy against it: when anyone has an occasion to file an appeal, he must refuse to pay the sum and fight out the point.
('8', 1, 2, 15, 3347) We believe that the fee is illegal; that is what the ruling of the court will probably be.
('8', 1, 2, 16, 3438) The best course is to ignore the law and violate it.
('8', 1, 2, 17, 3491) Wherever licences are refused in large numbers, people must trade without licences, rather than think of disposing of their stocks.
('8', 1, 2, 18, 3623) For all such ailments, passive resistance is the best cure.
('8', 1, 2, 19, 3683) [From Gujarati] Indian Opinion, 14 12 1907
('8', 1, 3, 20, 3726) 4. LATE NAWAB MOHSIN UL MULK
('8', 1, 4, 21, 3755) We have already reported 1 the news of the passing away of this gentleman.
('8', 1, 4, 22, 3830) In this issue, we give a brief sketch of his life.
('8', 1, 4, 23, 3881) Every Indian, especially every Muslim, should take a lesson from his services in the field of education.
('8', 1, 4, 24, 3986) He placed education above politics.
('8', 1, 4, 25, 4022) That was on the whole a realistic attitude, especially in his time.
('8', 1, 4, 26, 4090) The community can derive the highest benefits from education provided that, along with it, the people acquire truthful conduct and moral life.
('8', 1, 4, 27, 4233) But education is a dangerous thing in the absence of lofty conduct and morality.
('8', 1, 4, 28, 4314) It can be compared to a creeper unable to climb without the

('8', 2, 1, 2, 4439) support of a hedge.
('8', 2, 1, 3, 4459) It is such education accompanied by moral training that everyone should receive; that is what we can learn from the life of the late Nawab.
('8', 2, 1, 4, 4599) [From Gujarati] Indian Opinion, 14 12 1907
('8', 2, 2, 5, 4642) 5. GERMAN EAST AFRICA LINE
('8', 2, 3, 6, 4669) A new spirit of self respect and dignity is in the air these days among Indians.
('8', 2, 3, 7, 4750) At such a time, the incident that has occurred involving Mr. Peeran Mahomed calls for notice.
('8', 2, 3, 8, 4844) He asked for a first class ticket on a Europe bound steamer belonging to the [German East Africa] Line and it was refused to him.
('8', 2, 3, 9, 4974) We think this was a highly insulting thing to do.
('8', 2, 3, 10, 5024) It does not befit the German Company.
('8', 2, 3, 11, 5062) The Company derives a big income from Indian passengers.
('8', 2, 3, 12, 5119) Ignoring all this, it refuses to issue a first class ticket when demanded by an Indian passenger.
('8', 2, 3, 13, 5217) This ought to make us feel sorry for ourselves.
('8', 2, 3, 14, 5265) They know our ways.
('8', 2, 3, 15, 5285) They insult us becausewe are not likely to do anything about it.
('8', 2, 3, 16, 5350) They dare not do such a thing to a white passenger.
('8', 2, 3, 17, 5402) There are three remedies for this to be adopted simultaneously: (1) A strong protest should be made to the Company.
('8', 2, 3, 18, 5518) (2) Their agent, Mr. Osman Ahmad, should bring to the notice of the Company the loss that it might suffer.
('8', 2, 3, 19, 5625) (3) Passengers should be dissuaded from using the steamers of this Line.
('8', 2, 3, 20, 5698) The third step is the best.
('8', 2, 3, 21, 5726) The other two will have some effect only if the third is taken.
('8', 2, 3, 22, 5790) We have acquired new strength, which should be used on every occasion.
('8', 2, 3, 23, 5861) It is not enough that we oppose the Transvaal law.
('8', 2, 3, 24, 5912) That is to be treated only as a beginning.
('8', 2, 3, 25, 5955) Look at the example of Japan.
('8', 2, 3, 26, 5985) After coming into light, that nation has been paying attention to its education, its trade and its honour.
('8', 2, 3, 27, 6092) We, too, should work for progress in every field.

('8', 3, 1, 2, 6225) 6. ATTACK ON INDIANS 1
('8', 3, 2, 3, 6248) The air is thick with the excitement of the new law.
('8', 3, 2, 4, 6301) There is no doubt that people are now eagerly waiting to be arrested.
('8', 3, 2, 5, 6371) Nine Indians arrived from Durban on the morning of Friday last.
('8', 3, 2, 6, 6435) Eleven others came on the evening of the same day, and 17 on Saturday and Sunday.
('8', 3, 2, 7, 6517) All of them had their permits or registers with them.
('8', 3, 2, 8, 6571) Thirty five of them had arrived by the Sultan.
('8', 3, 2, 9, 6618) Of the remaining two, one was a Madrasi who was going to Johannesburg on business, and one was a Gujarati who had gone to Durban in October and was returning to Johannesburg.
('8', 3, 2, 10, 6793) At first, it was reported that all these persons were arrested for being without permits under the new law.
('8', 3, 2, 11, 6901) Mr. Gandhi presented himself at the court on Friday.
('8', 3, 2, 12, 6954) These men were not produced in the court on that day, since the police were awaiting orders from Pretoria.
('8', 3, 2, 13, 7061) They were produced on Saturday, and the case was adjourned till Monday.
('8', 3, 2, 14, 7133) Mr. Gandhi went to Johannesburg again on Monday.
('8', 3, 2, 15, 7182) The police wanted to bring up the case under the new law.
('8', 3, 2, 16, 7240) But there was an order from Pretoria that it should be proceeded with under the Peace Preservation Ordinance.
('8', 3, 2, 17, 7350) Hence they were prosecuted under Section 5 of the Peace Preservation Ordinance on a charge of being without permits.
('8', 3, 3, 18, 7467) DEPOSITION BY SERGEANT MANSFIELD 2
('8', 3, 4, 19, 7502) I arrested these Indians in accordance with instructions from Pretoria.
('8', 3, 4, 20, 7574) They all held valid permits, which, however, did not authorize them to return.
('8', 3, 4, 21, 7653) They were arrested because they did not have permits under the new law.
('8', 3, 5, 22, 7725) CROSS EXAMINATION Q*Did you examine the permits of these men?
('8', 3, 5, 23, 7787) I found on examination that they contained their thumb impressions.
('8', 3, 5, 24, 7855) Q*Do they also have with them registers taken out under the law of 1885?
('8', 3, 5, 25, 7928) A*They all have such registers.
('8', 3, 5, 26, 7960) Q*What are your orders from Pretoria?
('8', 3, 5, 27, 7998) A*I have orders to arrest every Indian coming from outside if

('8', 4, 1, 2, 8343) he is without a permit under the new law or any other authority.
('8', 4, 1, 3, 8408) Q*Do these instructions also apply to Indians whom you may know personally?
('8', 4, 1, 4, 8484) A*Yes, it will be my duty to arrest everyone.
('8', 4, 1, 5, 8530) Q*Is it true that, under the permits which you saw with the accused, Indians enjoyed complete freedom of movement till now?
('8', 4, 1, 6, 8654) A*Yes, I had instructions so far that those permits were sufficient authority.
('8', 4, 1, 7, 8733) The Public Prosecutor closed the case here.
('8', 4, 1, 8, 8777) Mr. Gandhi demanded that the accused should be set free for want of evidence.
('8', 4, 1, 9, 8855) The Public Prosecutor admitted that his case was weak, but that he had drafted the summons under orders from the Government.
('8', 4, 1, 10, 8980) Under the permits produced before the court, people were entitled to enter and reside [in the Transvaal] but not to leave and return.
('8', 4, 1, 11, 9114) Mr. Gandhi stated that the Crown witness himself had proved his clients case.
('8', 4, 1, 12, 9192) The authority for the clients to enter [the Transvaal] was the permit which the Crown witness had produced before the court.
('8', 4, 1, 13, 9317) In the summons, they were charged with entering without permits.
('8', 4, 1, 14, 9382) That charge had not been proved.
('8', 4, 1, 15, 9415) It had been held by the court in the case of Bhabha that a permit to enter the Colony included permission to leave it and to return.
('8', 4, 1, 16, 9548) His clients should therefore be discharged.
('8', 4, 1, 17, 9592) Many of them had suffered for four days by that time.
('8', 4, 1, 18, 9646) The magistrate upheld this contention and discharged all of them.
('8', 4, 1, 19, 9712) The following are the names of those who were prosecuted: Omar Yusuf, Nathu Govind, Madha Galal, Lala Madhav, Govind Dadi [Daji?], Ratanji Maharaj, Kunvarji Manor, Kala Pema, Nagar Bhavan, Morar Bhikha, Samandarkhan, Kana Gopal, Nana Vallabh, Babu Sukha, Prabhu Narain, Jasmat Fakir, Fakir Lakha, Hari Daji, Pema Bhana, Parbhu Chhana, Lallu Khushal, Ramasami Chokkalinga Pillay, Mani Dahya, Bhima Vasan, Zina Kidia, Dahya Pancha, Vallabh Govind, Dhana Hira, Hari Bhikh, Dayal Vallabh, Makan Morar, Madhav Jivan, Govind Dahya, Budhiya Lala, Daji Bhana, Ranchhod Gopal and Bhikha Ratanji.
('8', 4, 1, 20, 10299) I am glad to observe that there are here persons from all communities, one Pathan, one Konkani, one Madrasi, and the rest Gujarati Hindus.
('8', 4, 2, 21, 10438) MAHOMED ESSAKS CASE This case was heard on Friday in Volksrust.
('8', 4, 2, 22, 10502) The Public Prosecutor said that he did not know on what charge Mr. Essak was to
('8', 5, 0, 1, 10582) 6 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 5, 1, 2, 10622) be prosecuted.
('8', 5, 1, 3, 10637) He could say that only after hearing from the Government.
('8', 5, 1, 4, 10695) After argument, the magistrate agreed to transfer the case to Johannesburg and ordered the case to be heard there on Wednesday.
('8', 5, 1, 5, 10823) Mr. Mahomed Essak and other Indians had refused to offer bail.
('8', 5, 1, 6, 10886) They were therefore released unconditionally.
('8', 5, 1, 7, 10932) In the court, the Government was being ridiculed for these cases.

('8', 5, 2, 9, 11041) 7. REGULATIONS FOR MAKING APPLICATIONS FOR LICENCES IN NATAL
('8', 5, 3, 10, 11102) We give below a summary of all the important sections of the Regulations published in the Natal Gazette for making applications for the issue, renewal or transfer of licences or appeals in respect of them: Section 2. The application, in the prescribed form, should be addressed to the magistrate duly authorized for the purpose or to the Town Office, and the applicant shall publish a copy of the application at least one day in each week for at least two weeks in a local newspaper.
('8', 5, 3, 11, 11586) 4. Upon receipt of an application, the Licensing Officer shall be at liberty to obtain from the Health Officer or the Sanitary Inspector a report in respect to the sanitary arrangements on the premises proposed to be licenced.
('8', 5, 3, 12, 11813) 5. If required, the applicant shall appear personally and produce to the Licensing Officer his books of accounts, or such other documents as may be necessary, to show to the satisfaction of that Officer that he is able to fulfil the conditions laid down by Section 7 in regard to keeping books of accounts in the English language.
('8', 5, 3, 13, 12144) 6. The Licensing Officer shall endorse upon each application his decision as regards the issue or refusal of a licence.
('8', 5, 3, 14, 12264) 8. A licence shall not be issued until the necessary stamps are affixed or the money paid.
('8', 5, 3, 15, 12355) 9. The Licensing Officer may require an applicant, when issuing a licence to him, to give his signature or impressions of his thumb or fingers.
('8', 5, 4, 16, 12499) REGULATIONS CONCERNING APPEALS
('8', 5, 5, 17, 12530) 10. An applicant intending to file an appeal may give notice
('8', 6, 0, 1, 12591) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 7
('8', 6, 1, 2, 12634) within two weeks of the decision to the Clerk of the Board or the Council of his intention to appeal against the decision of the Licensing Officer.
('8', 6, 1, 3, 12782) With the notice of appeal shall be deposited a sum of  12. 10.0 towards the expenses of the members of the Board.
('8', 6, 1, 4, 12896) If there are more applicants than one, the expenses of the Appeal Board shall be divided equally among them.
('8', 6, 1, 5, 13005) 11. A notice of the day fixed for the hearing of appeals, together with a list of appeals, shall be fixed to the door of the Court House or Town Office for at least five days before the appointed date.
('8', 6, 1, 6, 13207) 13. The proceedings of the Board shall be open to the public.
('8', 6, 1, 7, 13269) 16. The appellant, and any interested person, shall be entitled to be heard upon the appeal by himself or by any person acting under his written authority, and also to bring forward evidence in support of the appeal.
('8', 6, 1, 8, 13486) The person opposing the appeal shall be entitled to the same rights.

('8', 6, 2, 10, 13598) 8. JOHANNESBURG LETTER
('8', 6, 3, 11, 13621) PUNJABIS PETITION
('8', 6, 4, 12, 13639) The reply to this petition is still under the consideration of the Government.
('8', 6, 4, 13, 13718) But the world has already given the reply, which has turned the sympathies of many Englishmen in favour of the Punjabis.
('8', 6, 4, 14, 13839) Everyone says that they should get justice.
('8', 6, 4, 15, 13883) The discussion on the petition is still going on.
('8', 6, 4, 16, 13933) We have already referred to the very strong criticism that has appeared in The Daily Graphic of England.
('8', 6, 5, 17, 14038) I WITHDRAW
('8', 6, 6, 18, 14049) I wrote about Mr. Parekhs spirit.
('8', 6, 6, 19, 14083) 1 I find that it was written in haste, and hence I withdraw my remarks.
('8', 6, 6, 20, 14155) At the time of writing this, Mr. Parekh is still in Newcastle.
('8', 6, 6, 21, 14218) Whether he will be there or not when this is published, I cannot say.
('8', 6, 6, 22, 14288) But to have called him especially brave and to have advised others to follow his examplethat itself was an error.
('8', 6, 6, 23, 14402) A brave man will take the lead in battle.
('8', 6, 6, 24, 14444) Mr. Parekh is still outside the Transvaal, hence the implied suggestion in my statement that he was braver than all of us does not stand.

('8', 7, 0, 1, 14620) 8 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 7, 1, 2, 14660) FALSEHOOD Mr. Hasan Mahomed Kala made a public statement that he regretted having made the application for registration and that he wished to withdraw it.
('8', 7, 1, 3, 14815) I now find that, on the very day that he wrote this letter declaring his intention to withdraw his application, he wrote another private letter to a friend of his saying that he would be glad if the title deed of slavery were issued to him immediately, and expressing concern at the delay.
('8', 7, 1, 4, 15105) I expose this duplicity merely as a matter of duty with a view to preventing a recurrence of such instances among us.
('8', 7, 1, 5, 15223) I am very sorry that Mr. Kala was one of the pickets at Pietersburg, which gave occasion to Mr. Chamney to assert that even pickets had applied for registers.
('8', 7, 2, 6, 15382) WHAT DOES VOLUNTARY REGISTRATION MEAN?
('8', 7, 2, 7, 15421) This question has often been discussed in this paper, but I find that there are still many Indians who do not understand the meaning of voluntary registration.
('8', 7, 2, 8, 15581) The whites did not understand what the new law meant till the time [for its enforcement] came; we are in the same position.
('8', 7, 2, 9, 15705) The main point of difference between voluntary registration and registration under the law is that the law confers upon us the status of slaves, whereas voluntary registration gives us human dignity.
('8', 7, 2, 10, 15905) To submit to registration under pressure by the Government is like riding an ass.
('8', 7, 2, 11, 15987) To register ourselves voluntarily is like riding an elephant.
('8', 7, 2, 12, 16049) Even though in voluntary registration we may have to supply the same particulars as under compulsory registration, the former is to be preferred; on the contrary, compulsory registration will not cease to be slavery even if the specific indications of slavery are removed therefrom.
('8', 7, 2, 13, 16332) It is a very harsh law, and that is the reason why the local Government clings to it like leeches, and we have been striving for these fifteen months to prevent their sticking on to us.
('8', 7, 2, 14, 16518) In other words, we wish to be on a footing of equality with the whites, and the whites want to degrade us.
('8', 7, 2, 15, 16625) The law will involve violation of our oath and bring us lasting disgrace.
('8', 7, 2, 16, 16699) If anyone asks why even voluntarily we should have our documents exchanged, the question can be easily and simply answered: (1) Just as we have taken an oath against the law, so also have we offered to have our documents exchanged voluntarily.
('8', 7, 2, 17, 16943) If now we refuse to do so, we shall have gone back on our word and proved ourselves liars.
('8', 7, 2, 18, 17034) (2) Indians are charged by many people with entering [the Transvaal] under false permits or without permits.
('8', 7, 2, 19, 17143) By voluntary registration we can disprove the charge; it is our
('8', 8, 0, 1, 17207) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 9
('8', 8, 1, 2, 17250) duty to do so, and it is because we have shown ourselves ready for it that we have been able to win the sympathies of people everywhere.
('8', 8, 1, 3, 17387) (3) To resist voluntary registration is to admit that we have been in the wrong.
('8', 8, 1, 4, 17468) (4) By voluntary registration we shall win still greater prestige than we have gained so far.
('8', 8, 1, 5, 17562) It should be remembered that as a general rule, it is only when people refuse to do a particular thing of their own free will, i.e., prove their weakness, that the law intervenes and exercises compulsion.
('8', 8, 1, 6, 17767) There are many Kaffirs who do not of their own accord stop drinking, hence wherever it is found necessary to use compulsion against them, legislative measures are resorted to to stop them from drinking.
('8', 8, 1, 7, 17970) The man who stops drinking under compulsion by law, and not as a matter of duty, cannot be called a virtuous man.
('8', 8, 1, 8, 18084) It is the man who of his own free will avoids drinking that is really virtuous.
('8', 8, 1, 9, 18164) There is the same difference between compulsory and voluntary registration.
('8', 8, 1, 10, 18240) (5) Voluntary registration will always keep us free.
('8', 8, 1, 11, 18293) For, under it no one can bind us more than we bind ourselves of our own accord.
('8', 8, 1, 12, 18373) A volunteer enlists himself for war only when he chooses to do so.
('8', 8, 1, 13, 18440) A mercenary who is driven by necessity to enlist himself is bound to fight whenever called upon to do so.
('8', 8, 1, 14, 18546) We can enumerate many such advantages of voluntary registr ation.
('8', 8, 1, 15, 18612) For the present, these arc enough.
('8', 8, 1, 16, 18647) No reference is made here to finger prints, etc.
('8', 8, 1, 17, 18696) For, that will be a matter of our own free will.
('8', 8, 1, 18, 18745) But we shall consider next week the difference, from a scientific point of view, between ten finger prints, and two thumb impressions.
('8', 8, 1, 19, 18880) For the present, what is necessary is to understand the exact meaning of voluntary registration.
('8', 8, 1, 20, 18977) OBJECTION In view of the possibility of a compromise at any time now, the Association has started giving thought to the question of voluntary registration.
('8', 8, 1, 21, 19133) An objection has been raised to this by some Gentlemen, who want to know why all people are not being consulted.
('8', 8, 1, 22, 19246) The objection has no force.
('8', 8, 1, 23, 19274) If the question of voluntary registration were a new proposal, it would have been undoubtedly necessary to invite delegates from all places, but the resolution concerning voluntary registration was passed at the mass meeting in the Empire Theatre by delegates representing all the places, and they had fully acquainted
('8', 9, 0, 1, 19593) 10 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 9, 1, 2, 19634) themselves with all facts relating tovoluntary registration.
('8', 9, 1, 3, 19695) Hence, there is no further need to consult delegates from all places.
('8', 9, 1, 4, 19765) Moreover, there is no time for it.
('8', 9, 1, 5, 19800) All the same, every Indian can express his opinion at any time.
('8', 9, 1, 6, 19864) We want that this struggle should lead us to a better understanding of political matters.
('8', 9, 1, 7, 19954) We also want to learn how meetings are conducted, how other associations are run and how public work is organized.
('8', 9, 1, 8, 20069) We have been fighting a strenuous battle to get the new law repealed, claiming that we are really a civilized people; if so, a proper understanding of the points referred to above is a mark of being truly civilized.
('8', 9, 2, 9, 20285) WHY TEST CASE SHOULD NOT BE MADE Some gentlemen have been arguing why we should not make a test case against the new law.
('8', 9, 2, 10, 20407) I have expressed myself against this for two reasons.
('8', 9, 2, 11, 20461) First, we are not fighting to make a test case, but to prove our strength by going to gaol.
('8', 9, 2, 12, 20553) There is nothing as effective as ones own strength.
('8', 9, 2, 13, 20605) If we proceed to make a test case, our struggle will get into a mess and we shall invite ridicule.
('8', 9, 2, 14, 20704) The whites will immediately say: What happened to those who were to go to gaol? Hence, making a test case will amount to an admission of weakness.
('8', 9, 2, 15, 20851) Second, the Privy Council will hardly be able to invalidate the new law or any other laws of the Colony.
('8', 9, 2, 16, 20956) An opinion has already been expressed against us by Mr. Leonard, Mr. Esselen, Mr. Gregorowski, Mr. Duxbury, Mr. Ward and Mr. De Villiers.
('8', 9, 2, 17, 21094) The Supreme Court has pronounced many judgments which go against us.
('8', 9, 2, 18, 21163) If the Privy Council were to invalidate the new law, that would mean that the laws passed against Kaffirs would also be ultra vires.
('8', 9, 2, 19, 21296) This can never happen.
('8', 9, 2, 20, 21319) If, by any chance, this did happen, immediately new laws would be passed to set matters right.
('8', 9, 2, 21, 21414) In the end we would only be where we were to start with.
('8', 9, 2, 22, 21471) We have called for [legal] opinion from England, which Mr. Ritch has not been able to send so far.
('8', 9, 2, 23, 21570) For, no one except Sir Raymond West is prepared to give it.
('8', 9, 2, 24, 21630) It should also be remembered that Sir Raymond West had advised us to make a test case instead of opposing the law.
('8', 9, 2, 25, 21745) Now, that gentleman has come over to the side of passive resisters.
('8', 9, 2, 26, 21813) How can a test case be made, then?
('8', 9, 2, 27, 21848) Moreover, no one should forget that a test case will mean an expense of  1,000. Who will be able to raise such a sum?
('8', 9, 2, 28, 21966) At the same time, let us be careful not to assume that the Government will not harass people while the test case is pending.
('8', 9, 2, 29, 22091) The law cannot remain suspended in the meantime.
('8', 10, 0, 1, 22140) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 11
('8', 10, 1, 2, 22184) HAMIDIA SOCIETY MEETING A large meeting was held again on Sunday.
('8', 10, 1, 3, 22250) So many people had collected that it was impossible to accommodate them in the hall.
('8', 10, 1, 4, 22335) Hence the meeting was held in the open ground outside.
('8', 10, 1, 5, 22390) Messrs Cachalia, Suj, Manibhai Desai, Pillay, Gopal, Beg and Vyas had comedown specially from Pretoria.
('8', 10, 1, 6, 22494) Mr. Emam Abdool Cadir was in the chair.
('8', 10, 1, 7, 22534) The meeting was addressed by him, and by Messrs Beg, Suj, Cachalia, Naidoo, Hajura Singh, Ahmed Khan, Alibhai Akuji and other gentlemen.
('8', 10, 1, 8, 22671) Mr. Gandhi explained the situation.
('8', 10, 1, 9, 22707) Mr. Moulvi Ahmed Mukhtiar, who had returned from Delagoa Bay where he had gone to attend to some work, explained [the situation] to the people and, in the end, it was agreed that voluntary registration must be accepted; there were, however, two Punjabi gentlemen who were against giving thumb impressions.
('8', 10, 1, 10, 23013) Others argued that there was no objection to giving them voluntarily.
('8', 10, 1, 11, 23083) This spirit of the people deserves admiration.
('8', 10, 1, 12, 23130) It shows that people are not afraid of expressing their views, and that they speak out with courage.
('8', 10, 1, 13, 23231) Those who did not understand anything about the law six months ago now understand something of it.
('8', 10, 1, 14, 23330) All this is the result of our trying to depend on our own strength.
('8', 10, 1, 15, 23398) I think everyone will come round in the end for, there is no humiliation in giving two thumb impressions.
('8', 10, 1, 16, 23504) It is humiliating to do so under compulsion.
('8', 10, 1, 17, 23549) Once the law is defeated, we can claim to be free.
('8', 10, 2, 18, 23600) PATHETIC CONDITION OF DELAGOA BAY Moulvi Saheb reports about Delagoa Bay that, at a time when throughout South Africa the Indian community is awake and fighting for its honour, the leaders there are sunk in lethargy.
('8', 10, 2, 19, 23817) They silently endure whatever harsh treatment the Government chooses to mete out to them.
('8', 10, 2, 20, 23907) People do not care for their honour.
('8', 10, 2, 21, 23944) They look upon money as their God.
('8', 10, 2, 22, 23979) And with the Government they behave like submissive courtiers.
('8', 10, 2, 23, 24042) Will not the Indians of Delagoa Bay rouse themselves from this pitiable condition?
('8', 10, 3, 24, 24125) STRENGTH OF INDIANS The Government is betraying more signs of weakness every day on the question of the new law.
('8', 10, 3, 25, 24238) Even the whites see this.
('8', 10, 3, 26, 24264) Two amusing cartoons (comic drawings which carry some meaning) are published in the Rand Daily Mail and The Sunday Times.
('8', 10, 3, 27, 24386) One of them shows General Smuts firing the pistol of the new law at the Indians.
('8', 10, 3, 28, 24467) The Indian says: Do your worst.
('8', 10, 3, 29, 24499) We shall never submit to the law. General Smuts then explains: Dont say so, pal.
('8', 10, 3, 30, 24580) My blooming gun is out of order. In the other cartoon, General Smuts and some
('8', 11, 0, 1, 24658) 12 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 11, 1, 2, 24699) Government officers want to cut off the heads of the Indian leaders with spears.
('8', 11, 1, 3, 24780) But the horses are altogether exhausted with the effort, and the riders themselves have become breathless; and still the heads of the leaders are intact.
('8', 11, 1, 4, 24934) Both these cartoons reveal the state of mind of the whites.
('8', 11, 1, 5, 24994) The editor of this paper is trying to secure the two cartoons for the readers of Indian Opinion; hence I dont write more about them.
('8', 11, 2, 6, 25127) SUCCESS OF ASSOCIATION The Municipality has passed a regulation prohibiting Indians from riding in a first class carriage.
('8', 11, 2, 7, 25250) The readers will recall the letter 1 that Mr. Essop Mia wrote against it.
('8', 11, 2, 8, 25324) Now General Smuts has written to say that the law will not be approved by the Government.
('8', 11, 2, 9, 25414) Is it that General Smuts has also changed a little?
('8', 11, 2, 10, 25466) This shows that it will do nothing but good to the Indian community if it asserts itself.
('8', 11, 3, 11, 25556) NO PASSPORTS A representation was made to Lord Selborne against the refusal of passports to Mr. Moosa Ismail and Mr. Davaji, in reply to which Lord Selborne has said that, if the Government did so, that would be tantamount to admitting the right of Indians to return even without having been registered.
('8', 11, 3, 12, 25860) This matter is not likely to rest here.
('8', 11, 3, 13, 25900) Mr. Gandhi has addressed another letter 2 to Lord Selborne on the question.
('8', 11, 3, 14, 25976) If this decision remains final, it will prove that Indians are not British subjects at all.
('8', 11, 3, 15, 26068) All right, let that be so.
('8', 11, 3, 16, 26095) Our struggle will gain more strength.
('8', 11, 4, 17, 26133) ONE SECTION OF NEW LAW One of the sections of the new law was considered to be in favour of the heirs of the late Mr. Aboobaker.
('8', 11, 4, 18, 26262) It was made much of by Lord Selborne, Lord Elgin and everyone else.
('8', 11, 4, 19, 26330) Now even that is gone.
('8', 11, 4, 20, 26353) General Smuts raised an objection to transferring land to the heirs under that section, saying that it could not apply to this case since the land was already transferred to the name of a white.
('8', 11, 4, 21, 26548) The objection was upheld by the court, though it expressed sympathy [for the heirs].
('8', 11, 4, 22, 26633) But what is the use of such sympathy?
('8', 11, 4, 23, 26671) This means that in the present case, even that one section of the law is proved to be of no avail.
('8', 11, 4, 24, 26770) This matter, too, is not likely to rest here.
('8', 11, 4, 25, 26816) The heirs are thinking of proceeding to obtain relief.
('8', 11, 4, 26, 26871) Meanwhile, the adverse decision in this case has given one more argument against the law.
('8', 11, 4, 27, 26961) And correspo ndence on the subject has commenced.

('8', 12, 1, 2, 27125) VICTIM OF LAW The new law, like the god of destruction, goes on devouring new victims.
('8', 12, 1, 3, 27212) The monster is fond of Indian blood.
('8', 12, 1, 4, 27249) Many waiters have lost their jobs, and labourers are out of employment.
('8', 12, 1, 5, 27321) We know of the protest made by the soldiers.
('8', 12, 1, 6, 27366) Now Mr. Mohanlal Joshi is in trouble.
('8', 12, 1, 7, 27404) He had a well paid job as an interpreter in the court at Pretoria.
('8', 12, 1, 8, 27471) He is relieved of his post by the Government for failing to take out a register.
('8', 12, 1, 9, 27552) This is nothing but extreme tyranny.
('8', 12, 1, 10, 27589) Though a man with a family, Mr. Joshi sacrificed his job for the sake of the country and upheld the honour of the community, on which I offer him my congratulations.
('8', 12, 1, 11, 27755) It is the duty of Indians to find jobs for those who are thus thrown out of employment.
('8', 12, 1, 12, 27843) If any Indian needs a clerk, I would strongly urge him to employ Mr. Joshi or others like him who become unemployed.
('8', 12, 2, 13, 27960) CONDOLENCES Mr. Dadabhai, the well known businessman here, has had news from home that his eldest son has died of the plague.
('8', 12, 2, 14, 28086) He is very much depressed by the news.
('8', 12, 2, 15, 28125) I join all those who have offered their condolences to him.
('8', 12, 3, 16, 28185) CASE AGAINST ESSAK This case came up for hearing on Wednesday before Mr. Jordan.
('8', 12, 3, 17, 28266) 1 The charge against Mr. Mahomed Essak was the same as that against 37 other Indians.
('8', 12, 3, 18, 28352) Mr. Chamney was also present.
('8', 12, 3, 19, 28382) The officer who gave evidence against him, repeated what he had said in the case of the other thirty seven people.
('8', 12, 3, 20, 28497) Mr. Gandhi, without giving any evidence for the accused, asked for his discharge.
('8', 12, 3, 21, 28579) Giving a long judgment, Mr. Jordan held that Mr. Mahomed Essak had the full right to reside [in the Transvaal] under his [old] permit, and that he could not at all be deported under the Peace Preservation Ordinance.
('8', 12, 3, 22, 28795) He was therefore discharged.
('8', 12, 4, 23, 28824) LINDSAYS SPEECH Mr. Lindsay is one of the leaders of the Progressive Party.
('8', 12, 4, 24, 28900) He said in a speech that the Government would not be harsh with the Indians.
('8', 12, 4, 25, 28977) The Immigration Law was not intended to be used against them.
('8', 12, 4, 26, 29039) There was only one way of expelling the Indians, and that was to stop issuing licences to them.
('8', 12, 4, 27, 29135) That would be done from January.
('8', 12, 4, 28, 29168) I treat this as mere raving.
('8', 12, 4, 29, 29197) First, it was Imprisonment.
('8', 12, 4, 30, 29225) Then they started talking of deportation.
('8', 12, 4, 31, 29267) Now they have come to licences.
('8', 12, 4, 32, 29299) And so, gradually the law will vanish altogether if the Indian community keeps

('8', 13, 3, 5, 29582) [JOHANNESBURG, December 14, 1907]
('8', 13, 4, 6, 29616) [THE HONBLE THE COLONIAL SECRETARY PRETORIA
('8', 13, 5, 7, 29660) SIR,] I have the honour to state that I was discharged yesterday from the Johannesburg gaol.
('8', 13, 5, 8, 29753) I was sentenced to be imprisoned for one month under the Peace Preservation Ordinance and the Asiatic Law Amendment Act for remaining in the Colony without a permit, my permit having expired on the 30th day of September last.
('8', 13, 5, 9, 29979) The reasons for my having disobeyed the order of the Registrar of Asiatics that I should leave the Colony are set forth in the letter addressed to him by me.
('8', 13, 5, 10, 30137) The Hindu temple at Germiston, in its present form, owes its existence to me.
('8', 13, 5, 11, 30215) I was, and still am, the only priest in charge.
('8', 13, 5, 12, 30263) On proceeding to the temple yesterday, I found it in a desolate condition.
('8', 13, 5, 13, 30338) The temple had remained closed for the whole of the month.
('8', 13, 5, 14, 30397) I cannot here describe adequately the state of my feelings on seeing the condition of the temple yesterday.
('8', 13, 5, 15, 30505) I am aware that now, in accordance with the laws of the Colony, I should leave it within 7 days if I wish to escape imprisonment.
('8', 13, 5, 16, 30635) But a law higher than the laws of the Colony dictates to me another course that, as a British subject, and as a preacher of religion in charge of the Hindu temple at Germiston, I should adhere to my duty, irrespective of all consequences.
('8', 13, 5, 17, 30874) With due submission and in all humility, and consistently also with my duty to the Imperial Government and to the local Government, I beg now to inform you that it is not my intention to leave the Colony.
('8', 13, 5, 18, 31079) The Hindu congregation at Germiston and I myself would appreciate the strength of the Government in allowing me to continue my duty to my temple and congregation by issuing to me a permit, for which I hereby apply.
('8', 13, 5, 19, 31294) In this connection; I cannot help stating that the charges, of which I still know nothing, hinted at by the Registrar of Asiatics and which were given as the reason for refusing to extend my permit, were, so far as I have guessed them, unfounded.
('8', 13, 5, 20, 31541) If there are any charges

('8', 14, 1, 2, 31610) against me, I request that they may be formulated and I may be put on my trial; and, if I have, in anything I have done, departed from my religion, as I know it, or from my avocation of priest, I should immediately and voluntarily leave the Colony.
('8', 14, 1, 3, 31859) If the charges are such that they cannot be brought against me legally, even then I should be preparedto answer them before any impartial person with a legal training who might be specially appointed by the Government for the purpose.
('8', 14, 1, 4, 32094) This is the least that I venture to claim from a civilised and Christian Government.

('8', 14, 6, 9, 32305) THE HONBLE THE COLONIAL SECRETARY [PRETORIA]
('8', 14, 8, 10, 32350) RE: ESTATE [OF] LATE ABOOBAKER AMOD
('8', 14, 9, 11, 32386) As the Government is aware, Clause 17 of the Asiatic Law Amendment Act was inserted in order to give relief to the heirs of this Estate and to enable them to hold Erf 373 in Church Street, Pretoria, purchased by the late Mr. Aboobaker Amod before Law 3 of 1885 was passed.
('8', 14, 9, 12, 32659) Before the Clause was drafted last year, the circumstances under which the property was transferred in favour of Mr. Polak were placed before the then Attorney General and it was understood that the Clause was drawn up in order to meet the case.
('8', 14, 9, 13, 32905) A Deed of Transfer was duly framed to register the Erf in favour of the heirs, who are British Indians, and submitted to the Registrar of Deeds.
('8', 14, 9, 14, 33050) He, however, threw out the transfer, because in his opinion the case was not covered by the Clause in question.
('8', 14, 9, 15, 33162) The matter then went before Mr. Justice Wessels in Chambers, who upheld the Registrars contention.
('8', 14, 9, 16, 33261) The Clause in question has thus proved ineffectual for giving relief to the heirs.
('8', 14, 9, 17, 33344) May I venture to trust that the Government will grant relief to the heirs?
('8', 14, 9, 18, 33419) In my humble opinion, the most expeditious method of doing this would be to declare that portion of the street capable of

('8', 15, 7, 8, 33781) SIR, The matter of the Standerton Indians in the employ of the C.S.A.R., about which I had the honour of speaking to you through the telephone, seems, the more I think of it, of such serious importance that it will be the duty of my Association to thrash it out as a question of public morality and also, if need be, of law.
('8', 15, 7, 9, 34106) My Association, however, is most anxious to avoid a legal struggle, and I, therefore, venture to ask you, if you can see your way to do so, to pay the men a months wage in lieu of notice.
('8', 15, 7, 10, 34294) In my humble opinion, that is the least consideration to which the men are entitled.
('8', 15, 7, 11, 34379) I should, perhaps, state that I have telegraphed to the Standerton Committee asking them to advise the men to accept whatever may be paid to them, subject to their right to claim wages in lieu of a months notice.

('8', 15, 11, 15, 34708) We observe that some Indians in the Transvaal are getting impatient to see the end of the struggle.
('8', 15, 11, 16, 34808) But the end is not in sight just yet.
('8', 15, 11, 17, 34846) Great things are not achieved in a day.
('8', 15, 11, 18, 34886) Everywhere in South Africa people know that this is a struggle for the honour of Indians.
('8', 15, 12, 19, 34976) 1 This was, however, declined by the authorities.
('8', 16, 0, 1, 35026) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 17
('8', 16, 1, 2, 35070) is intended to prove that we are a nation, that we ought to have our rights, that we are free.
('8', 16, 1, 3, 35165) What is the point of being hasty when fighting for such big stakes?
('8', 16, 1, 4, 35233) The end will come only after a large number of persons become seasoned in gaol, the others remaining unbending, meanwhile.
('8', 16, 1, 5, 35356) It will be seen from our Johannesburg Letter this week that General Smuts is in no mood to yield.
('8', 16, 1, 6, 35454) It will appear from this that he has been privately informed that the Indians will give in at last.
('8', 16, 1, 7, 35554) He has yet the weapon of Licences which he can use.
('8', 16, 1, 8, 35606) Why should he abandon oppressive measures against the Indians before he has tried out every means?
('8', 16, 1, 9, 35705) W. Warriors on the battle field yield only is a last resort.
('8', 16, 1, 10, 35766) No one should imagine that our struggle is not a battle because it involves no bloodshed or use of real ammunition.
('8', 16, 1, 11, 35882) Ours also is a battle, with this difference, that in it, the right being on our side, there can be only one result.
('8', 16, 1, 12, 35998) If we become impatient, that will mean that to that extent we are less in the right.
('8', 16, 1, 13, 36083) Truth is to win, it can be only in the fulness of time.
('8', 16, 1, 14, 36139) In fact it wins soon enough, but when we look at the matter superficially, we get an impression of long delay.
('8', 16, 1, 15, 36250) Those who are prepared to defend their oath and honour at any cost as they would defend their life have nothing to lose if the result is slow in conning.

('8', 16, 2, 17, 36447) 13. RAM SUNDAR PUNDIT
('8', 16, 3, 18, 36469) Punditji has been released.
('8', 16, 3, 19, 36497) And he may have been also rearrested by the time this issue reaches the hands of our readers.
('8', 16, 3, 20, 36591) His life is no longer his own, it belongs to the public.
('8', 16, 3, 21, 36648) He has placed himself at the disposal of the community.
('8', 16, 3, 22, 36704) It is not possible for him now to retreat.
('8', 16, 3, 23, 36747) His spirit deserves admiration.
('8', 16, 3, 24, 36779) There is a heavy responsibility on him.
('8', 16, 3, 25, 36819) He is a priest and also a preacher.
('8', 16, 3, 26, 36855) We hope to see in him the spirit of renunciation.
('8', 16, 3, 27, 36905) Such men ought to be without any attachments, and naturally modest, gentle, truthful and free from greed.
('8', 16, 3, 28, 37011) Till there is a large number of such men, it will not even be possible for India to be free.
('8', 16, 3, 29, 37104) Punditji has taken a big step.
('8', 16, 3, 30, 37135) We hope and pray that he will retain the honour that he has won.

('8', 17, 1, 2, 37284) 14. HAJEE HABIB
('8', 17, 2, 3, 37300) Mr. Hajee Habib has now left the Transvaal to settle in Durban.
('8', 17, 2, 4, 37364) There was, therefore, a farewell party in his honour at Pretoria, which we report in this issue.
('8', 17, 2, 5, 37461) The community is passing through such difficult times at present that we can hardly give attention to arranging a function in honour of anyone, otherwise Mr. Hajee Habib would not have left Pretoria with nothing more than a party.
('8', 17, 2, 6, 37692) He has had a long record of [public] service.
('8', 17, 2, 7, 37738) It is impossible to make a proper return for all that he has done for hundreds of men.
('8', 17, 2, 8, 37825) While doing all this, Mr. Hajee Habib never gave a thought to his own interests.
('8', 17, 2, 9, 37906) He always held himself ready for public work.
('8', 17, 2, 10, 37952) He was as able as he was keen.
('8', 17, 2, 11, 37983) White officers found it difficult to enter into argument with him.
('8', 17, 2, 12, 38050) We hope that Mr. Hajee Habib will render the same service in Durban that he did in the Transvaal, and take full part in public activities.

('8', 17, 4, 15, 38256) Mr. Ram Sundar Pundit was released from gaol on the 13th.
('8', 17, 4, 16, 38314) A large number of Indians were present to give him a fitting reception.
('8', 17, 4, 17, 38386) They included Mr. Essop Mia, the Moulvi Saheb, Messrs Fancy, Thambi Naidoo, Gandhi and others.
('8', 17, 4, 18, 38481) From Pretoria, there were Messrs Cachalia, Pillay and Gopal.
('8', 17, 4, 19, 38542) He came out of the prison exactly at half past eight.
('8', 17, 4, 20, 38596) The Chinese Association was represented by Mr. Quinn and others.
('8', 17, 4, 21, 38661) Punditji was enthusiastically received with garlands and bouquets.

('8', 17, 6, 24, 38795) ADDITIONS TO BLACKLEGS For once, the Asiatic Office has proved to be right.
('8', 17, 6, 25, 38871) It says that, in all, 511 Indians have applied for registration as slaves.
('8', 17, 6, 26, 38946) According to Indian estimates, only 399 persons had applied.
('8', 17, 6, 27, 39007) But I realize from reliable information received by me that the correct figure is 511.
('8', 17, 7, 28, 39094) 1 This was published as A Special Report.
('8', 18, 0, 1, 39136) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 19
('8', 18, 1, 2, 39180) Besides, there is the more painful information that gentlemen like Mr. Hasan Mia Camroodeen Zatam, of the firm of Sheth M. C. Camroodeen, Mr. Gulam Mahomed Hurzug, the Treasurer of the Anti Indian Law Fund, Mr. Hajee Cassim, Mr. Haji Jusab of Pretoria and Mr. Ally Habib have had their faces blackened.
('8', 18, 1, 3, 39483) I shall not say anything about Mr. Hasan Mia.
('8', 18, 1, 4, 39529) I think he has lost his balance of mind in connection with this law.
('8', 18, 1, 5, 39598) Mr. Gulam Mahomeds case is very much to be regretted.
('8', 18, 1, 6, 39652) It appears that they performed the black deed in great secrecy.
('8', 18, 1, 7, 39716) The have been rumours about them for quite some time, but I did not [so far] attach any weight to them.
('8', 18, 1, 8, 39820) I feel ashamed to find that therumours have proved true.
('8', 18, 1, 9, 39877) Mr. Hajee Cassim and Mr. Ally also appear to have registered themselves quite secretly.
('8', 18, 1, 10, 39965) Their words come back to me even as I write this.
('8', 18, 1, 11, 40015) There is no point in reproducing them.
('8', 18, 1, 12, 40054) But I think it is at any rate my duty to say that, if persons like Mr. Hajee Cassim and Mr. Ally wanted to get themselves registered, they should have come out boldly in the open to do so.
('8', 18, 1, 13, 40243) I see their names at the end of the list.
('8', 18, 1, 14, 40285) That shows that they got their hands soiled at the very last minute.
('8', 18, 1, 15, 40354) They will feel hurt by what I write.
('8', 18, 1, 16, 40391) I assure them that they could not feel more hurt than I did when I heard of their cowardice.
('8', 18, 1, 17, 40484) I am obliged to publish these names, hoping that the community will thus be rid of false personal considerations, groundless fears and corruption.
('8', 18, 1, 18, 40631) In addition, I also see the names of Khoja Velsi Keshavji.
('8', 18, 1, 19, 40690) and Khoja Manji Keshavji.
('8', 18, 1, 20, 40716) There are other names with me, but I shall publish them later.
('8', 18, 1, 21, 40779) This time I have given only the more prominent ones.
('8', 18, 2, 22, 40832) APPEAL TO BLACK LEGS AND SUGGESTION Peoples memories being short, I assume that in the course of time we shall forget the black deeds of the black faced ones.
('8', 18, 2, 23, 40991) We shall remember that, notwithstanding their acts of treachery against the community, they are Indians.
('8', 18, 2, 24, 41096) If they feel really ashamed and desire the good of the community, they can take part in the struggle that will commence in January.
('8', 18, 2, 25, 41228) They will have to produce the title deeds of slavery when applying for licences.
('8', 18, 2, 26, 41309) If they do not produce them, they will have the privilege of bearing the hardships which will be inflicted on the other Indians who have not accepted slavery.
('8', 18, 2, 27, 41468) Any blackleg who regrets what he has done can act in this manner.
('8', 18, 2, 28, 41534) I hope that there will be at least a few who will show such courage.
('8', 18, 3, 29, 41603) WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN JANUARY?
('8', 18, 3, 30, 41632) The suggestion made above immediately raises the question about January.
('8', 18, 3, 31, 41705) We should think of January as we thought of December.
('8', 18, 3, 32, 41759) The Government did notcould notshow its strength in December; I think the same will be true of January.
('8', 18, 3, 33, 41863) That no one
('8', 19, 0, 1, 41875) 20 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 19, 1, 2, 41916) would be arrested in December could not, however, be anticipated.
('8', 19, 1, 3, 41982) I dont believe that no one will be harassed likewise in January.
('8', 19, 1, 4, 42047) It must be distinctly remembered that those who cannot produce the title deed of slavery will not get licences.
('8', 19, 1, 5, 42159) The Government will have no need to yield on that point.
('8', 19, 1, 6, 42216) Since a notice has been issued to that effect, it is bound to be acted upon.
('8', 19, 1, 7, 42293) What, then, should be done?
('8', 19, 1, 8, 42321) The reply has been given several times in the past; it is, that we should trade without a licence.
('8', 19, 1, 9, 42420) If arrested and fined, one should not pay the fine but go to gaol instead.
('8', 19, 1, 10, 42495) Gaol going is the only unfailing remedy.
('8', 19, 1, 11, 42536) The different kinds of licences are not all issued by the Government.
('8', 19, 1, 12, 42606) Licences for Kaffir eating houses and for hawkers are issued by the municipalities.
('8', 19, 1, 13, 42690) The Government has no power to arrest men who are concerned only with such licences.
('8', 19, 1, 14, 42775) The municipalities will decide what should be done.
('8', 19, 1, 15, 42827) It is probable, therefore, that some of these at least will make an attack.
('8', 19, 1, 16, 42903) For instance, the Boksburg Municipality.
('8', 19, 1, 17, 42944) There is no need to get frightened on this account; rather, one should be glad of it.
('8', 19, 1, 18, 43030) I dont agree that it is good that the Government has not started the attack yet.
('8', 19, 1, 19, 43111) It is up to us to wrest our freedom, such is the present struggle.
('8', 19, 1, 20, 43178) That being so, we shall not acquire real courage till a large number of us have gone through the hardship of imprisonment.
('8', 19, 1, 21, 43301) It has already been declared that Mr. Gandhi will run down to those who are arrested in connection with this struggle.
('8', 19, 1, 22, 43420) To defend here means to see the brave one off to gaol.
('8', 19, 1, 23, 43475) I am sorry that, in the matter of licences, there is provision for a sentence of fine and imprisonment in case of default.
('8', 19, 1, 24, 43598) Temptation is a bad thing.
('8', 19, 1, 25, 43625) Great harm will be done if anyone succumbs to the temptation and pays the fine I hope therefore that every Indian will pledge himself never to pay any fine in this matter, either in his own case or on behalf of someone else.
('8', 19, 2, 26, 43850) WHAT ABOUT COMPROMISE?
('8', 19, 3, 27, 43873) Thinking of January, we are naturally led to ask what happened to the move for a compromise.
('8', 19, 3, 28, 43966) I point out in reply that I for one had taken into account every eventuality.
('8', 19, 3, 29, 44044) Efforts for a compromise are continuing.
('8', 19, 3, 30, 44085) But I feel that there will be no compromise till the Government has tried out the weapon that will be available to it in January.
('8', 19, 3, 31, 44215) Meanwhile, everyone can see that the Indians have grown very much stronger.
('8', 19, 3, 32, 44291) An increasing number of newspapers controlled by the whites condemn the Government and wish success to the Indians.
('8', 19, 3, 33, 44407) If anyone had expressed himself in favour of us three months ago, he would have been laughed at.
('8', 19, 3, 34, 44504) But just as the newspapers controlled by the whites have now started writing in our favour, so also will the whites themselves get up when in January they find a large number of Indians in prison, and will ask the Government to release
('8', 20, 0, 1, 44740) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 21
('8', 20, 1, 2, 44784) It is just in a manner of speaking that we use the word compromise.
('8', 20, 1, 3, 44852) Its strings are in our hands.
('8', 20, 1, 4, 44882) When we have proved our worth, our manliness, people will come seeking compromise with us, so irresistible are manliness and truth.
('8', 20, 2, 5, 45014) CARTOON IN THE CRITIC The Critic has published an amusing cartoon this time.
('8', 20, 2, 6, 45091) It shows an Indian flourishing a placard, with the words No Power of Deportation, and General Botha and his ministers running away from him.
('8', 20, 2, 7, 45232) There have been so far three cartoons on passive resistance, including this one.
('8', 20, 3, 8, 45313) GOVERNMENTS OBSTINACY It appears that General Smuts has given a blunt refusal to those who were seeking a compromise.
('8', 20, 3, 9, 45431) He declares that he has not the slightest intention of repealing the law or withdrawing the notice.
('8', 20, 3, 10, 45531) These threats of General Smuts need not frighten anyone.
('8', 20, 3, 11, 45588) He is in the habit of talking whatever comes into his head.
('8', 20, 3, 12, 45648) He will grow wiser when he begins to carry out his threats.
('8', 20, 4, 13, 45708) AID FROM UITENHAGE Indians at Uitenhage have sent contributions in aid of the struggle, for which the Association has offered them thanks.
('8', 20, 4, 14, 45847) I hope that others will follow the example of these friends.
('8', 20, 4, 15, 45908) If the Indians at Port Elizabeth have raised a fund they should send it [to the Association].
('8', 20, 5, 16, 46002) AID FOR SOUTH AFRICA BRITISH INDIAN COMMITTEE A sum of 16.8.6. has been received from the Hindus of Potchefstroom through Mr. Ratanji Lakhmidas and 5 from Mr. Nanaji Ghela for the Committee.
('8', 20, 5, 17, 46193) If similar contributions are received from other Indians, the Committee will probably be free from its difficulties.
('8', 20, 5, 18, 46310) It should be remembered that the expenditure that Mr. Ritch has had to incur on account of the serious illness of Mrs. Ritch is being met out of the funds of the Committee.
('8', 20, 6, 19, 46483) BHIKHA NARAN Some information abut this person has already been given.
('8', 20, 6, 20, 46554) He was working as a servant with Mr. Dell Lace.
('8', 20, 6, 21, 46602) He feels extremely sorry now.
('8', 20, 6, 22, 46632) He has handed over to the Association the acknowledgement for his application.
('8', 20, 6, 23, 46711) He has left for India without taking out the title deed of slavery.
('8', 20, 6, 24, 46779) His relatives were very much annoyed with him for his having disgraced himself and were thinking of declaring him an outcast.
('8', 20, 6, 25, 46905) But they appear to have calmed down after he had left for India.
('8', 20, 6, 26, 46970) Here is an instance to prove that a slave cannot be happy even
('8', 21, 0, 1, 47033) 22 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 21, 1, 2, 47074) in his dreams.
('8', 21, 1, 3, 47089) It happens quite often that being the servant of a white turns a man into a coward.
('8', 21, 1, 4, 47173) Bhikha Naran was engaged by Mr. Lace to look after his washing.
('8', 21, 2, 5, 47237) POLICE IN PRETORIA MOSQUE After the incident of Banutkhan and Haji Ebrahim, police are posted at the mosque in Pretoria every Friday to prevent a breach of the peace.
('8', 21, 2, 6, 47404) The presence of the police brings disgrace to the community.
('8', 21, 2, 7, 47465) It implies that the trustees of the mosque are weak.
('8', 21, 2, 8, 47518) I hope that they will take immediate steps to stop the posting of the police, if they have not done so already.
('8', 21, 3, 9, 47630) NEW INDIAN ADVOCATE Mr. George Godfrey was enrolled as an attorney in the Supreme Court on the 13th.
('8', 21, 3, 10, 47731) Most probably he will practise in Johannesburg.
('8', 21, 3, 11, 47779) I offer him my congratulations.
('8', 21, 3, 12, 47811) Mr. George Godfrey is the third son of Mr. Subhan Godfrey to have received education in England.
('8', 21, 3, 13, 47908) They are now preparing to send the fourth son for medical studies.
('8', 21, 4, 14, 47975) ASIATIC OFFICE
('8', 21, 5, 15, 47990) Mr. Burgess has been informed that his services will not be required after January 31 [1908].
('8', 21, 5, 16, 48084) Similarly three clerks (whose names I shall report later) have been relieved in Pretoria.
('8', 21, 6, 17, 48174) DELEGATES TO CONGRESS
('8', 21, 7, 18, 48196) A cable has been received from Mr. Ameeroodeen Fajandar to say that he reached Bombay safely on the 17th.
('8', 21, 8, 19, 48302) EUROPEAN CHAMBER OF TRADE AT JOHANNESBURG
('8', 21, 9, 20, 48344) A meeting of the Chamber was held during this week, at which a resolution was passed expressing the hope that the Government would enforce the provisions of the new law.
('8', 21, 9, 21, 48514) One of the speakers asserted that there was considerable pressure from the Imperial government on this question.
('8', 21, 9, 22, 48627) It was therefore necessary for the people of Johannes burg to support the Government.
('8', 21, 10, 23, 48713) ASIATIC OFFICE The clerks in the Asiatic Office who have been relieved along with Mr. Burgess are Mr. Dobson, Mr. Barker, Mr. Valks and Mr. Sweet.

('8', 22, 3, 4, 49021) THE GENERAL MANAGER C.S.A.R. JOHANNESBURG
('8', 22, 4, 5, 49063) SIR, This morning I received from the local Indian Committee at Standerton a letter of which the free translation is as follows: The balance of the months rations that were given to the railway employees in the beginning of the month was all taken away from them, and the rooms that were occupied by them wereunroofed yesterday (19th inst.).
('8', 22, 4, 6, 49405) Therefore, all have come here.
('8', 22, 4, 7, 49436) The Committee has arranged for their accomm odation.
('8', 22, 4, 8, 49489) They worked until noon yesterday, but they were not paid anything for that day.
('8', 22, 4, 9, 49569) They implored that they might be allowed to go to town to find accommodation, and then take away their wives and children, but even the children have been put out.
('8', 22, 4, 10, 49733) You were pleased to give me your assurance, and I notice the same assurance repeated in your communication to the press, namely, that there is no desire on the part of your Department to act harshly or to take advantage in any way of its rights.
('8', 22, 4, 11, 49979) If, therefore, there is any truth in the above communication, the officials who were carrying out the instructions have evidently been guilty of a grave dereliction of duty.
('8', 22, 4, 12, 50153) May I ask you kindly to make the necessary inquiries, and let me know?
('8', 22, 5, 13, 50224) I have, etc.,

('8', 23, 3, 5, 50482) 1 At the time of the Boer War, the Dutch at first pretended to withdraw and then attacked the British.
('8', 23, 3, 6, 50585) In the same way, the Government may, perhaps, pretend to have been defeated and may strike later.
('8', 23, 3, 7, 50683) Therefore, we should only think that our struggle has just started.
('8', 23, 3, 8, 50751) If they withhold the licences, we must carry on trade without them and, on being arrested, should go to gaol rather than pay the fine.
('8', 23, 3, 9, 50886) Further, we must build a Hall of Unity.
('8', 23, 3, 10, 50926) It can be done with a small amount.
('8', 23, 3, 11, 50962) We can thereby provide employment to the Indians who have lost their jobs.
('8', 23, 3, 12, 51037) We should again call a mass meeting to explain to the people the position about the licences.
('8', 23, 4, 13, 51131) As Moulvi Mukhtiar Sahebs permit was due to expire, Mr. Gandhi discussed some points connected with that and with the struggle.

('8', 24, 2, 3, 51471) [VREDEDORP, December 27, 1907]
('8', 24, 3, 4, 51502) Mr. Gandhi said, when he read the announcement with reference to the Immigration Restriction Act that morning, the first thing that voluntarily came to his lips was that Lord Elgin had put an undue strain on Indian loyalty.
('8', 24, 3, 5, 51726) Lord Elgin, an ex Viceroy of India, had forgotten altogether Indian tradition.
('8', 24, 3, 6, 51805) When he advised His Majesty to sanction this legislation, he forgot altogether that he was trustee for the millions of India.
('8', 24, 3, 7, 51931) He forgot altogether that India was today on the brink of a departure which had been unknown in Indian annals.
('8', 24, 3, 8, 52042) India has never been revoluntionary, but today they found that the revolutionary spirit had crept into the minds of some Indians.
('8', 24, 3, 9, 52172) It would be a bad day for India when that forcible revolutionary spirit gained a substantial footing, but he could not help saying that Lord Elgin had sown the seed.
('8', 24, 3, 10, 52338) If this had been confined to the student world, it would probably never grow in Indian soil, but he found today that the merchant, who did not know a word of English, was steeped in the new spirit with reference to the Act and its evil.
('8', 24, 3, 11, 52575) He felt proud of the fact that he had taken so much part in the matter.
('8', 24, 3, 12, 52647) But he coupled with that the statement that his thoughts had been their thoughts, and in expressing them he had, if anything, moderated them.
('8', 24, 3, 13, 52789) It was for this reason that he expressed the feeling that Lord Elgin had put an undue strain on Indian loyalty by sanctioning this Immigration Restriction Act.
('8', 24, 3, 14, 52949) That Act, to his mind, was a barbarous Act.
('8', 24, 3, 15, 52993) It was the savage Act of a civilized Government, of a Government that dared to call itself Christian.
('8', 24, 3, 16, 53095) If Jesus Christ came to Johannesburg and Pretoria and examined the hearts of General Botha, General Smuts and the others, he thought he would notice something strange, something quite strange to the Christian spirit.
('8', 24, 3, 17, 53312) He (Mr. Gandhi) recognized that in proceeding under the Act, General Smuts had selected those men who had been in the public eye, and had not laid his hands on the poor people.
('8', 24, 3, 18, 53489) And he had not the slightest doubt that if those men who had to appear before the magistrate were imprisoned or deported, those who remained behind would be firm in opposition
('8', 24, 4, 19, 53665) 1 Gandhiji addressed a crowded meeting in the Hamidia Islamic Society hall in the evening.
('8', 24, 4, 20, 53756) Earlier that morning, Gandhiji had received a telephone message from Mr. H.F.D. Papenfus, Acting Commissioner of Police for the Transvaal, asking him to call on him.
('8', 24, 4, 21, 53922) Upon arriving there, he was informed that arrests had been ordered of himself, Thambi Naidoo (chief picket, Johannesburg), P.K. Naidoo (picket, Johannesburg), C.M. Pillay, Jamadar Nawab Khan (pickets, Johannesburg), Karwa (ex soldier, Johannesburg), Leung Quinn (Chairman, Chinese Association, Johannesburg), John Fortoen (Chinese picket), Martin Easton (Johannesburg), Ram Sundar Pundit (Germiston), G.P. Vyas (Pretoria), A.F.C. Beg (Pretoria), M.I. Desai (chief picket, Pretoria), A.M. Cachalia (Pretoria), Ismail Suliman Suj (Pretoria), Goolam Mahomed Abdool Rashid (Pretoria), B. Gangaram (Pretoria), V.U. Sheth (Pretoria), Ismail Jooma (Pretoria), Rahmat Khan (Pretoria), M.M. Khanderia (Pietersburg), Amershi Gokul (Pietersburg) and Ambalal (Pietersburg).
('8', 24, 4, 22, 54684) Gandhiji gave his word that all would appear before the respective magistrates at 10 a.m.
('8', 24, 4, 23, 54774) the next day, Saturday, December 28. Mr. Papenfus accepted this guarantee.

('8', 25, 1, 3, 54946) gave powers which would press hard 1 on the poor husbands.
('8', 25, 1, 4, 55005) They might be taken away from their families, and he instanced the case of Mr. Naidoo, who had shone brilliantly throughout the campaign.
('8', 25, 1, 5, 55143) He had a wife and five children who had been in the Colony for five years.
('8', 25, 1, 6, 55218) What was to happen if he were deported, and who was going to take care of his wife and children?
('8', 25, 1, 7, 55315) He could not find a single section in the Act which was to protect the families of those deported.
('8', 25, 1, 8, 55414) What was it the Government wanted to do?
('8', 25, 1, 9, 55455) Why had it not the honesty to tell the Indians they were not wanted in the country?
('8', 25, 1, 10, 55539) And why this indirect method of enforcing its powers?
('8', 25, 1, 11, 55593) He had called some sections of the Act savage, and he said they were only worthy of an uncivilized Government.
('8', 25, 1, 12, 55704) If those powers were so used and if all of them were deported or imprisoned, that were an honour for them rather than that they should forsake their solemn obligations and bid good bye to their manhood and self respect only because they were earning a few miserable pence or pounds.
('8', 25, 1, 13, 55987) He would never be sorry for the advice he had given them, and he also said, with reference to their 15 months fight, 2 that it was well done.
('8', 25, 1, 14, 56129) This was legislation which no self respecting nation and no self respecting man could acceptnot because of its regulations, but because it was class legislation of the worst type, based on entire distrust of the community and based on charges flung against them without any proof.
('8', 25, 1, 15, 56410) They had asked Lord Selborne and General Smuts that these charges should be proved before an impartial tribunal.
('8', 25, 1, 16, 56523) They were brought by a man steeped in prejudice and incapable of judging facts.
('8', 25, 1, 17, 56603) Why should the Government not acknowledge that the least due to them was a fair trial?
('8', 25, 1, 18, 56690) He did not dwell on the fact that the Indians had no representation, but he did dwell on the fact that the Government should be so callous in reference to the feelings of the people who had no representative.
('8', 25, 1, 19, 56899) It seemed to him that they had come to the parting of the ways.
('8', 25, 1, 20, 56963) The Imperial Government must hesitate if it meant to retain its hold on the people of India through their affections and not at the point of the bayonet.
('8', 25, 1, 21, 57117) England might have to choose between India and the Colonies.
('8', 25, 1, 22, 57178) It might not be today or tomorrow, but he felt the seeds had been sown by Lord Elgins action.
('8', 25, 1, 23, 57272) It had not been possible for him to choose soft words or to strain his comment when he found the Asiatic Act with the Immigration Act super added.
('8', 25, 1, 24, 57419) There was a story of how Mahomed and two 3 fellows were sheltering in a cave, being pursued by a large hostile force.
('8', 25, 1, 25, 57537) His companions began to quail, and asked what they three could do against such heavy odds.
('8', 25, 1, 26, 57628) You say We three, said Mahomed, I say We four, for God is with us, and with Him on our side we shall prevail. God was with them, and so long as their cause was good, he did not mind a bit what powers the Government were given or how savagely those powers were used.
('8', 25, 1, 27, 57894) Even then he would give the same advice that he had ventured to give them for the last 15 months.

('8', 26, 1, 2, 58433) 20. INDIANS IN DELAGOA BAY 1
('8', 26, 2, 3, 58462) We publish in another column the full text of the remarkable regulations framed by the local Government at Delagoa Bay to restrict Asiatic immigration.
('8', 26, 2, 4, 58614) The regulations deal with three kinds of immigrants; or, rather, Asiatic visitors: (l) those who may leave Delagoa Bay; (2) those who may enter Delagoa Bay from outside districts; (3) Asiatics from Portuguese possessions in Asia.
('8', 26, 2, 5, 58844) They have decidedly a Transvaal flavour about them.
('8', 26, 2, 6, 58896) The Asiatics at Delagoa Bay, who have approached the Governor General, have been told that the regulations are necessary because the province is threatened with a large influx of Asiatic immigrants from the neighbouring colonies, and that they are of a merely temporary nature.
('8', 26, 2, 7, 59174) We trust that the British Indians at Delagoa Bay will not rest satisfied with the explanation given by the Governor General.
('8', 26, 2, 8, 59299) As a matter of fact, there is absolutely no influx into Portuguese territory from the Transvaal, and, even if there were, there would be little justification for harassing the domiciled British Indians in that Province.
('8', 26, 2, 9, 59519) Why, for instance, should they possess a special going out permit?
('8', 26, 2, 10, 59586) We understand that permanent documents have already been issued to them.
('8', 26, 2, 11, 59659) Why cannot British Indians leave Delagoa Bay without a licence and without proving that they are neither criminals nor bankrupts?
('8', 26, 2, 12, 59789) Under given circumstances, probably such a precaution may be in the interests of public justice, but Asiatics have by no means a monopoly of crime and bankruptcy.
('8', 26, 2, 13, 59952) Europeans leave Delagoa Bay as often as they please without having to prove that they have not criminally broken the laws of the country, or become insolvent.
('8', 26, 2, 14, 60111) The only redeeming feature of these harsh regulations is that the Portuguese Government, unlike Colonial British Governments, have recognised the necessity of drawing a broad distinction between Asiatics who are their own subjects and those who are not.
('8', 26, 2, 15, 60365) We trust that, as Delagoa Bay is a foreign country, Lord Elgin will find it possible to secure some measure of relief from these vexatious restrictions.

('8', 27, 1, 2, 60654) 21. WHAT TO DO FOR THOSE THROWN OUT OF EMPLOYMENT?
('8', 27, 2, 3, 60705) The reader will gather from this issue that the Indian railway workers at Standerton and Heidelberg have lost their jobs for refusing to submit to the obnoxious law.
('8', 27, 2, 4, 60871) What should be done if a large number of people become unemployed in this manner?
('8', 27, 2, 5, 60953) This question ought to engage the attention of every Indian.
('8', 27, 2, 6, 61014) We have repeatedly stated that, if anyone suffers monetary loss before he is imprisoned, he will have to bear the loss himself.
('8', 27, 2, 7, 61142) The community can offer no help in such a case.
('8', 27, 2, 8, 61190) But it will be cruel to remain indifferent when hundreds of people face starvation.
('8', 27, 2, 9, 61274) We are told, besides, that starvation may drive a man to the meanest of jobs.
('8', 27, 2, 10, 61352) 1 In India, people in famine stricken areas are driven by hunger to sell their children.
('8', 27, 2, 11, 61441) It should not then be surprising if such ignoble hunger drives men to take out registers.
('8', 27, 2, 12, 61531) If therefore a large number of men are thrown out of employment, it will be necessary to provide aid to them.
('8', 27, 2, 13, 61641) Every Indian must think of this problem and send whatever he can to the Association at Johannesburg.
('8', 27, 2, 14, 61742) The next question to consider is what should be done after money has been collected.
('8', 27, 2, 15, 61827) If doles or allowances are paid to people for days on end without taking any work from them, that will only encourage vice and harm the recipients.
('8', 27, 2, 16, 61975) We are therefore of the view that the services of such people should be utilized for some public work project.
('8', 27, 2, 17, 62086) Mr. Gandhi has suggested the construction of a big hall.
('8', 27, 2, 18, 62143) It is a difficult undertaking, but worth taking up, and will be very easy to carry out if there is a large number of Indians to help.
('8', 27, 2, 19, 62277) It will serve three purposes.
('8', 27, 2, 20, 62307) The community will have a big building in the Transvaal for political purposes; jobless Indians will be provided with means of livelihood and the Indian struggle will get wide publicity through the construction of such a big building.
('8', 27, 2, 21, 62542) Indians outside the Transvaal ought not to be tight fisted, taking the view that, in case the Transvaal Indians build a hall, they alone will get the benefit of it.
('8', 27, 2, 22, 62707) Whether the hall is built or not, aid has to be provided to the jobless.
('8', 27, 2, 23, 62780) It is a problem that should engage the attention of every Indian.
('8', 27, 2, 24, 62846) If a hall is built, most of the expenditure will have to be borne by the Transvaal Indians themselves.

('8', 28, 2, 3, 63180) Women in England have surpassed all expectations.
('8', 28, 2, 4, 63230) When the Indian community started the struggle against the obnoxious law in the Transvaal, the suffragette movement in England was many months old.
('8', 28, 2, 5, 63378) They are still continuing the struggle undaunted.
('8', 28, 2, 6, 63428) The struggle of the Transvaal Indians is nothing when compared with the courage and the tenacity of these women.
('8', 28, 2, 7, 63541) Moreover, they have to face opposition from many women.
('8', 28, 2, 8, 63597) There is a much larger number of women against than in favour of franchise for themselves.
('8', 28, 2, 9, 63688) Though a mere handful, these women do not admit defeat.
('8', 28, 2, 10, 63744) The more they are repressed, the more the resistance they offer.
('8', 28, 2, 11, 63809) Many of them have been to gaol.
('8', 28, 2, 12, 63841) They have borne being kicked and stoned by base and cowardly men.
('8', 28, 2, 13, 63907) There was a cable last week that they had resolved to intensify their struggle still further.
('8', 28, 2, 14, 64001) There are taxes to be paid to the Government by these women or their husbands.
('8', 28, 2, 15, 64080) If they do not pay the taxes, whatever things they possess can be auctioned.
('8', 28, 2, 16, 64157) They may even be imprisoned.
('8', 28, 2, 17, 64186) The women have now resolved that they will not pay any taxes or levies till they get their rights, but will rather allow their possessions to be auctioned, and they themselves will suffer imprisonment.
('8', 28, 2, 18, 64388) This courage and tenacity deserves to be emulated by the Transvaal Indians, in fact, by the whole Indian community.
('8', 28, 2, 19, 64504) The Natal Indians think it much of a hardship if their goods are to be auctioned for trading without a licence.
('8', 28, 2, 20, 64616) These people do not realize that the Government cannot auction the goods of a large number of people.
('8', 28, 2, 21, 64718) But what would it matter if it did ?
('8', 28, 2, 22, 64755) If women can sacrifice their possessions for a matter like franchise, cannot we put up with a similar hardship while fighting for our livelihood?
('8', 28, 2, 23, 64901) The movement of the suffragettes will go on for a long time, and they will keep up the agitation, resolute and tireless.
('8', 28, 2, 24, 65022) They fight on with faith in truth, persuaded that, though they will not be there to enjoy the rights, if only the succeeding generations enjoy them, it will be as good as if they had themselves done so.
('8', 28, 2, 25, 65225) Indians have to fight with the same spirit.

('8', 29, 2, 3, 65420) We publish elsewhere in this issue the full text of the Regulations for Registration of Indians in Delagoa Bay.
('8', 29, 2, 4, 65532) These Regulations are quite harsh.
('8', 29, 2, 5, 65567) It appears that Indians have already seen the Governor in this connection, but so far they have received no satisfactory reply.
('8', 29, 2, 6, 65695) If these Regulations come to stay, even the most princely Indian will need a permit accompanied with his photograph while going to Delagoa Bay.
('8', 29, 2, 7, 65839) A person on his way from the Transvaal can have a permit only if he establishes his right to return to the Transvaal.
('8', 29, 2, 8, 65957) All this mischief has originated in Pretoria.
('8', 29, 2, 9, 66003) Even if an Indian wishes to leave Delagoa Bay for good, he cannot do so without a permit.
('8', 29, 2, 10, 66093) He can leave only when he proves that he has never committed a crime, and that he is not an insolvent.
('8', 29, 2, 11, 66196) This is a new kind of oppression that is being introduced.
('8', 29, 2, 12, 66255) The Portuguese subjects of India are exempted from this law.
('8', 29, 2, 13, 66316) Are the Indians of Delagoa Bay going to submit to such a law?
('8', 29, 2, 14, 66378) When Moulvi Saheb Ahmed Mukhtiar returned from Delagoa Bay, he gave a fine account of the lethargy and indifference of the Indians there.
('8', 29, 2, 15, 66516) If the Indian community at Delagoa Bay does not shake off its lethargy even now and do what is required, it will deserve the scorn of every Indian.

('8', 29, 4, 18, 66744) Last week, we gave a brief report of the marriage of Mr. Dawad Mahomeds daughter, Ashabibi, with his nephew, Mr. Gulam Hoosen.
('8', 29, 4, 19, 66871) We extend our congratulations to Mr. Dawad Mahomed, his daughter and his son in law, and wish the couple a long and happy married life.
('8', 29, 4, 20, 67007) But it is the simplicity which Mr. Dawad Mahomed observed in the celebration and the donations he made on the occasion on which he really deserves congratulations.
('8', 29, 4, 21, 67171) If a person observes the common religious ceremonies, that will make him happy, ensure simplicity and save him unnecessary expenditure.
('8', 29, 4, 22, 67307) Mr. Dawad Mahomed had the marriage solemnized according to the injunctions of the holy Koran, with the result that there was no ostentation or false show on the occasion.
('8', 29, 4, 23, 67478) This is an example for everyone to follow, an example of how a marriage can be celebrated with due religious rites, but withoutfollowing any harmful customs.
('8', 29, 4, 24, 67636) We think equally highly of

('8', 30, 1, 3, 67780) If everyone followed his example, the various religious or political bodies would not have to face the shortage of funds that they experience at present.

('8', 30, 3, 6, 68000) To respect our own language, speak it well and use in it as few foreign words as possiblethis is also a part of patriotism.
('8', 30, 3, 7, 68124) We have been using some English terms just as they are, since we cannot find exact Gujarati equivalents for them.
('8', 30, 3, 8, 68238) Some of these terms are given below, which we place before our readers.
('8', 30, 3, 9, 68310) We shall publish in this journal the name of the person who supplies Gujarati equivalents for them which may be found acceptable.
('8', 30, 3, 10, 68440) We shall also present him with 10 copies of the booklet we have published on the new law, which may be circulated by him among friends.
('8', 30, 3, 11, 68576) The book is not offered by way of inducement, but to honour the recipient and spread information about the obnoxious law.
('8', 30, 3, 12, 68698) We hope that our readers will take the trouble of suggesting suitable equivalents not for the sake of the prize but out of patriotism.
('8', 30, 3, 13, 68833) The following are the terms in question: Passive Resistance; Passive Resister; Cartoon; Civil Disobedience.
('8', 30, 3, 14, 68941) There are other words too, but we shall think of them some other time.
('8', 30, 3, 15, 69012) It should be noted that we do not want translations of these English terms, but terms with equivalent connotations.
('8', 30, 3, 16, 69128) There will be no objection if the words are derived from Sanskrit or Urdu.

('8', 30, 5, 19, 69264) The news of the death of the eldest son of Mr. Dadabhai of Johannesburg has set us thinking about many things.
('8', 30, 5, 20, 69375) Such deaths occur in India by hundreds of thousands every year.
('8', 30, 5, 21, 69439) Whole villages have been wiped out by the plague.
('8', 30, 5, 22, 69489) Families have been destroyed.
('8', 30, 5, 23, 69519) Very often we read newspaper reports of all the members of a family, parents and children, having perished.
('8', 30, 5, 24, 69627) Why is it that, though the plague occurs elsewhere, too, it does not destroy as many people as it does in India?
('8', 30, 5, 25, 69740) I am sure no lover of India can help asking this question.
('8', 30, 5, 26, 69799) The answer to it, we believe,
('8', 31, 0, 1, 69829) 32 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 31, 1, 2, 69870) includes everything connected with the welfare of India.
('8', 31, 1, 3, 69927) It is easy to ask the question, but difficult to find the answer.
('8', 31, 1, 4, 69993) It is still more difficult, when the answer is found, to convince others that it is the right answer.
('8', 31, 1, 5, 70095) However, we think it worth while to make an attempt to give a partial answer to this question.
('8', 31, 1, 6, 70190) After careful thought, we have come to the conclusion that, if the plague, starvation, etc., have become more widespread in India, it is because of the sinfulness of the people.
('8', 31, 1, 7, 70368) If anyone wants to attribute it to the wickedness of the Government, we shall agree with him.
('8', 31, 1, 8, 70462) It is a common experience that people suffer when the rulers are wicked.
('8', 31, 1, 9, 70535) But it needs to be borne in mind that it is only a sinful people who have wicked rulers.
('8', 31, 1, 10, 70624) Besides, it is as a rule more profitable to examine our own faults than to blame others.
('8', 31, 1, 11, 70713) Disunity and enmity between Hindus and Muslims are sins.
('8', 31, 1, 12, 70770) But they are not fundamental sins.
('8', 31, 1, 13, 70805) If disunity disappears and the two communities live in peace and amity, foreign rule may go or the ways of the rulers may change.
('8', 31, 1, 14, 70935) But there is no reason to believe that when that happens, the plague and famines will disappear as a matter of course.
('8', 31, 1, 15, 71054) The chief sin is the untruthfulness of the people of India.
('8', 31, 1, 16, 71114) During the plague, we deceive the Government and deceive ourselves.
('8', 31, 1, 17, 71182) We make an outward show of cleanliness, but do not really observe it.
('8', 31, 1, 18, 71252) If anything is to be fumigated, we only make a show of doing it.
('8', 31, 1, 19, 71317) If we can do so with impunity, we avoid carrying out our obligations by bribing the police, if possible.
('8', 31, 1, 20, 71422) We are used to this state of affairs from our childhood.
('8', 31, 1, 21, 71479) They teach something at school.
('8', 31, 1, 22, 71511) The pupils readily accept it.
('8', 31, 1, 23, 71541) Returning home, they do exactly the contrary.
('8', 31, 1, 24, 71587) Parents acquiesce in such conduct.
('8', 31, 1, 25, 71622) Rules are given as to how cleanliness should be maintained.
('8', 31, 1, 26, 71682) Whether they are such as should be observed or not is a different question.
('8', 31, 1, 27, 71758) There can be a difference of opinion on that point.
('8', 31, 1, 28, 71810) What we want to prove is that we base our conduct on falsehood.
('8', 31, 1, 29, 71874) In most matters we only make an outward show.
('8', 31, 1, 30, 71920) That has a debilitating effect on our nerves.
('8', 31, 1, 31, 71966) Our blood becomes poisoned with the impurities of sinfulness and succumbs to germs of any kind.
('8', 31, 1, 32, 72062) It is observed that certain castes or communities are not affected by the plague.
('8', 31, 1, 33, 72144) The reason is that they do not make any false pretences with regard to cleanliness or any other matter.
('8', 31, 1, 34, 72248) They do not show themselves better than they are.
('8', 31, 1, 35, 72298) To that extent, we think they are superior to those who make a false show.
('8', 31, 1, 36, 72373) We do not imply by this that all people behave in this manner.
('8', 31, 1, 37, 72436) But by and large that is what happens.There is another dreadful habit, born of this very sin, which has spread among all classes of people.
('8', 31, 1, 38, 72576) And that is the sensuality adultery prevalent among us.
('8', 31, 1, 39, 72632) This matter can be touched upon only

('8', 32, 1, 2, 72713) in brief.
('8', 32, 1, 3, 72723) Ordinarily, people fight shy of discussing this question.
('8', 32, 1, 4, 72781) We, too, feel some hesitation.
('8', 32, 1, 5, 72812) However, we think it our duty to place our views beforethe readers.
('8', 32, 1, 6, 72880) Adultery does not consist merely in sexual intercourse with another mans wife.
('8', 32, 1, 7, 72959) We are taught by every religion that there can be adultery even in intercourse with ones own wife.
('8', 32, 1, 8, 73058) Sexual intercourse is justified only when it is the result of a desire for offspring.
('8', 32, 1, 9, 73144) Ordinarily, it is observed that sexual intercourse is the result of passion, the birth of a child following merely as a consequence.
('8', 32, 1, 10, 73277) India, in our judgment, is in such a miserable state that it is necessary at present for births to be reduced to a minimum.
('8', 32, 1, 11, 73401) Therefore, whatever sexual intercourse takes place will for the most part be in the nature of adultery.
('8', 32, 1, 12, 73505) If this view is correct, it is the duty of every thoughtful Indian not to marry.
('8', 32, 1, 13, 73586) In case he is helpless in regard to marriage, he should abstain from sexual intercourse with his wife.
('8', 32, 1, 14, 73689) All this is quite difficult to practise.
('8', 32, 1, 15, 73730) But there is no escape from it.
('8', 32, 1, 16, 73762) Otherwise we shall find it necessary to imitate the people of the West.
('8', 32, 1, 17, 73834) They adopt monstrous methods to control child birth.
('8', 32, 1, 18, 73887) They start wars and allow large numbers of people to be destroyed and, having abandoned their faith in God, they only seek means of surrounding themselves with material comforts and luxuries.
('8', 32, 1, 19, 74079) By following them, the Indians, too, can in course of time win freedom from the plague, etc.
('8', 32, 1, 20, 74172) But we do not think the evil tendencies of the West can have a foothold in India.
('8', 32, 1, 21, 74254) That means that India will either keep herself free from sinful ways of living, with her eyes fixed on God, and so win happiness, or will ever remain in a state of death in life, enduring never ending slavery, cowardly and fearful of death, rotting with the plague or such other inflictions.
('8', 32, 1, 22, 74546) Some people will find these ideas strange, or ridiculous, or as born of ignorance.
('8', 32, 1, 23, 74629) But we make bold to assert that every thoughtful Indian ought to give them his fullest consideration.
('8', 32, 1, 24, 74731) Such as they are, these thoughts are the result of this writers deep experience of life.
('8', 32, 1, 25, 74820) In any case, there will be no harm in putting them into practice.
('8', 32, 1, 26, 74886) No one will lose anything by observing truth and celibacy.
('8', 32, 1, 27, 74945) And it need not be asked what the people will gain if just a few persons follow this way of life.
('8', 32, 1, 28, 75043) If anyone asks such a question, he will be taken for an ignorant person.

('8', 33, 1, 2, 75200) 27. ARAB WISDOM
('8', 33, 2, 3, 75216) We discussed in previous issues some books in the series The Wisdom of the East 1. The same writers have brought out a book on the subject noted above and have sent us a copy for review.
('8', 33, 2, 4, 75403) It is hardly necessary to say that the book is in English.
('8', 33, 2, 5, 75462) It is priced at one shilling only.
('8', 33, 2, 6, 75497) It contains extracts from the holy Koran, and reproduces the sayings of Arab thinkers on different matters.
('8', 33, 2, 7, 75605) For instance, with reference to nobility, it is said that He who disregards his own honour gets no good from an honourable lineage .
('8', 33, 2, 8, 75738) Learning and high principles cover the shame of low origin. 2 The book is full of rich thoughts having a bearing on our struggle for honour.
('8', 33, 2, 9, 75879) The poet says: Men see no fault in one who respects himself. Then again: Be ashamed in your own sight more than in the sight of men. Once more: He who respects not himself can have no respect for others. And elsewhere it is said: Life has no worth and this world has no happiness for a man who has lost his self respect and abandoned himself to shamelessness. Under Character, we have: A man is truly religious when he is truly good. Under Knowledge, we have: A man without education is like a brave man without arms. Kings govern men and learned men govern kings. A wise man is not he who considers how he may get out of an evil, but he who sees to it that he does not fall into it. On Truthfulness, it is said: No mans religion can be right unless his heart becomes right, nor can his heart become right unless his tongue is right.
('8', 33, 2, 10, 76713) That man is a hypocrite who prays and fasts, but is untruthful in what he says, false to his word, and unfaithful in discharging a trust. Such are the golden sayings contained in this little book.
('8', 33, 2, 11, 76910) We advise everyone who can read English to buy this book.

('8', 34, 2, 3, 77262) MASS MEETING
('8', 34, 3, 4, 77275) A mass meeting of Indians will be held in front of the Surati mosque on Wednesday, January l, at 4 p.m.
('8', 34, 3, 5, 77379) to consider the struggle regarding licences from January onwards.
('8', 34, 3, 6, 77445) It is hoped that the meeting will be attended by Indians from all parts.
('8', 34, 4, 7, 77518) SOME THOUGHTS ON QUESTION OF LICENCES
('8', 34, 5, 8, 77556) We considered some aspects of the question last week, but it is necessary that we should give it further thought.
('8', 34, 5, 9, 77670) There is reason to believe that the real struggle will centre on this question.
('8', 34, 5, 10, 77750) It will certainly be necessary to trade without licences.
('8', 34, 5, 11, 77808) I find that there will be no need to produce registers when making applications for licences in respect of every kind of business.
('8', 34, 5, 12, 77939) The words used in the law are trading licences, which denote licences for business.
('8', 34, 5, 13, 78023) Such licences do not include licences for washermen or for bicycles.
('8', 34, 5, 14, 78092) That means that washermen will get their licences without having to produce registers.
('8', 34, 5, 15, 78179) It is the merchants and hawkers who will feel the need most.
('8', 34, 5, 16, 78240) If both these classes of Indians behave like men, the community will be free soon enough.
('8', 34, 5, 17, 78330) Also, on looking into the law, I find it doubtful whether Indians can be prosecuted in the month of January.
('8', 34, 5, 18, 78439) No person can be prosecuted for failure to take out a licence until after a month is over.
('8', 34, 5, 19, 78530) It appears therefore that prosecutions will take place in the month of February.
('8', 34, 5, 20, 78611) If any merchant is nervous, he can take out a licence in the name of his wife, in case he is married.
('8', 34, 5, 21, 78713) He can save himself from imprisonment by doing so.
('8', 34, 5, 22, 78764) But we are fighting to be, and to prove ourselves, men of courage.
('8', 34, 5, 23, 78831) I cannot therefore advise playing for safety.
('8', 34, 5, 24, 78877) I ask every Indian to apply for a licence for the sake of formality.
('8', 34, 5, 25, 78946) There is no need to spend anything on a lawyer for the purpose of making an application.
('8', 34, 5, 26, 79035) All that has to be done is to make an application and, after tendering the fee, mark time.
('8', 34, 6, 27, 79126) MOULVI SAHEB
('8', 34, 7, 28, 79139) The temporary permit of Moulvi Saheb Ahmed Mukhtiar expires on December 31. He has therefore applied for its extension.
('8', 34, 7, 29, 79259) I very much hope that this will not be granted and that the Moulvi Saheb will have been installed in prison.
('8', 34, 7, 30, 79368) But I see that my hope is in vain.
('8', 34, 7, 31, 79403) The Government does not have that much courage.
('8', 34, 7, 32, 79451) In view of the critical situation, it may even grant extension.
('8', 34, 7, 33, 79515) If not, he will be allowed to go free.
('8', 35, 0, 1, 79554) 36 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 35, 1, 2, 79595) REPLY TO PUNDITJI
('8', 35, 2, 3, 79613) General Smuts has replied to the letter concerning Punditji.
('8', 35, 2, 4, 79674) He writes that Punditji will not be given a permit.
('8', 35, 2, 5, 79726) He does not say anything more.
('8', 35, 2, 6, 79757) I conclude from this that neither will a permit be given to him nor will he be arrested.
('8', 35, 3, 7, 79846) INDIANS OF STANDERTON
('8', 35, 4, 8, 79868) The Indian railway workers at Standerton were dismissed for having failed to apply for registers.
('8', 35, 4, 9, 79966) There are about forty of them.
('8', 35, 4, 10, 79997) No notice was given to them.
('8', 35, 4, 11, 80026) Mr. Patel writes to say that they were not even paid for the day on which they were dismissed.
('8', 35, 4, 12, 80121) The balance of the months rations that was given to them was taken away from them.
('8', 35, 4, 13, 80204) Turning a deaf ear to the entreaties of the workers on behalf of their womenfolk and children, they removed the roofs of their rooms that very day with a view to driving them out.
('8', 35, 4, 14, 80384) The matter has been taken up with the General Manager.
('8', 35, 4, 15, 80439) He has ordered payment of wages up to the end of the month.
('8', 35, 4, 16, 80499) The Association has demanded a months wages in lieu of notice.
('8', 35, 4, 17, 80562) This is a case which will infuriate every Indian.
('8', 35, 4, 18, 80612) The Government is afraid of Indians who are independent and strong, and therefore seeks: to intimidate the weak.
('8', 35, 4, 19, 80725) This is the limit of tyranny.
('8', 35, 4, 20, 80755) These poor workers have lost their jobs, relying on merchants and other leading Indians.
('8', 35, 4, 21, 80844) If those merchants and leaders now yield at the last moment and embrace slavery out of fear of imprisonment or monetary loss, they will earn the curses of the poor Indians and their families.
('8', 35, 5, 22, 81036) INDIAN LABOURERS AT HEIDELBERG
('8', 35, 6, 23, 81067) At Heidelberg, Indian labourers were intimidated and taken to a magistrate.
('8', 35, 6, 24, 81143) On hearing rumours that they had expressed their readiness before the magistrate to take out registers, Punditji and Mr. Naidoo ran up to the place.
('8', 35, 6, 25, 81292) They saw the people.
('8', 35, 6, 26, 81313) Their leader, a Pathan named Abdool, assured them with great confidence that not one of them would get himself registered.
('8', 35, 6, 27, 81436) Punditji and Mr. Naidoo then went to Forchew and, spending the night at Mr. Mogalias, started work in the morning.
('8', 35, 6, 28, 81551) They were on their feet the whole day, acquainting the labourers with the nature of the law.
('8', 35, 6, 29, 81644) At several places they had to ford streams, etc., and go through much hardship.
('8', 35, 6, 30, 81724) These labourers also will beor by now must have beendismissed.
('8', 35, 6, 31, 81787) Probably more information will be available next week.
('8', 35, 6, 32, 81842) Thus, after his release from imprisonment, Punditji has not had a moments rest.
('8', 35, 7, 33, 81922) CARTOON IN THE SUNDAY TIMES
('8', 35, 8, 34, 81950) The Sunday Times has been giving much publicity to our

('8', 36, 1, 2, 82049) struggle.
('8', 36, 1, 3, 82059) It pokes a little fun at the law and at Mr. Smuts under the title Mr. Gandhis Dream.
('8', 36, 1, 4, 82144) One of the figures in the cartoon is Mr. Smuts.
('8', 36, 1, 5, 82192) Leaning his head upon his hands, with the elbows resting on the table, he is musing: Registration is a great bother; And Resistance greater than that; The old C.B. worries me a lot, And Gandhi drives me mad.
('8', 36, 1, 6, 82400) This is what Mr. Smuts is muttering to himself.
('8', 36, 1, 7, 82448) C.B. refers to the Prime Minister of England, Mr. Campbell Bannerman.
('8', 36, 1, 8, 82518) In the second cartoon, Mr. Gandhi is shown with armour on.
('8', 36, 1, 9, 82577) It is covered all over with pointed nails.
('8', 36, 1, 10, 82620) There is a notice above the picture, Do not touch me, and it is signed below, Yours passively, Gandhi.
('8', 36, 1, 11, 82723) What is being suggested is this: Why does he sign himself Yours passively, when touching any part of his body would give sharp pricks?
('8', 36, 1, 12, 82858) The point is that when the law is pricked with the thorns of passive resistance, it loses all its force.
('8', 36, 2, 13, 82963) ATTACK ON GERMISTON INDIANS
('8', 36, 3, 14, 82991) A meeting of the Germiston Municipality was held.
('8', 36, 3, 15, 83041) It discussed a motion that Indians should not be allowed any rights in the Market Square.
('8', 36, 3, 16, 83131) Mr. Preddy spoke against it.
('8', 36, 3, 17, 83160) Others, especially Mr. White, spoke in favour of it.
('8', 36, 4, 18, 83213) LIST OF BLACKLEGS
('8', 36, 5, 19, 83231) I give below the list which I promised last week.
('8', 36, 5, 20, 83281) The names given there are repeated in this list.
('8', 36, 5, 21, 83330) These are the names of persons registered since October 19. I have also their addresses with me.
('8', 36, 5, 22, 83427) I am sorry that I do not have the [serial] numbers, but they are not needed, for the list is authentic.
('8', 36, 5, 23, 83531) It does not contain names of any persons from Madras and Calcutta, but there are very few of them.
('8', 36, 5, 24, 83630) Blacklegs from Pretoria: [a list of 84 names]; from Johannesburg : [10]; from Pietersburg: [35]; from Louis Trichardt: [8] from Hartswater : [1]; from Christiana: [2]; from Potchefstroom: [11]; from Standerton: [5]; from Middleburg: [8]; from Ermilo: [1]; from Lydenburg: [2]; from Heidelberg: [8]
('8', 36, 6, 25, 83928) DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IMPRESSIONS OF FINGERS AND THUMBS
('8', 36, 7, 26, 83981) I had promised to discuss this matter some time, 1 and I do so now.
('8', 36, 7, 27, 84049) Thumb impressions are widely used in civil matters in India.
('8', 36, 7, 28, 84110) In England they have become a rage.

('8', 37, 1, 2, 84251) impressions to one another.
('8', 37, 1, 3, 84279) Pensioners and others are required to give impressions of thumbson receipts.
('8', 37, 1, 4, 84356) In Natal it is the practice to have thumb impressions on promissory notes.
('8', 37, 1, 5, 84431) Thumb impressions are thus taken because they make it easy to identify a person.
('8', 37, 1, 6, 84512) Impressions of two thumbs are taken, rather than of one, in order that, in case the impression of one of the thumbs is not clear, or is defaced, or has any other defect, the other impression can serve the purpose.
('8', 37, 1, 7, 84726) Apart from these, no impressions of fingers are required for the purpose of identification.
('8', 37, 1, 8, 84818) Digit impressions are taken from criminals because the person who is a criminal wants to evade being identified.
('8', 37, 1, 9, 84931) He always wants to remain unrecognized.
('8', 37, 1, 10, 84971) A person who has been required to give impressions of all fingers and thumbs can be identified by means of these impressions even if he has not given his correct name.
('8', 37, 1, 11, 85139) Research workers have prepared an index by means of which persons can be classified into different categories according to the impressions of their fingers and thumbs.
('8', 37, 1, 12, 85307) Hence, it is possible to prepare an index with the help of impressions.
('8', 37, 1, 13, 85379) Any person who has given his name as Ramji, which is not available on the records of the Government, can however be traced with the help of the index of impressions, if the impressions of his fingers and thumbs are available.
('8', 37, 1, 14, 85605) In this way many crimes have been detected in India and elsewhere.
('8', 37, 1, 15, 85672) This means that impressions of all fingers and thumbs are taken from criminals.
('8', 37, 1, 16, 85752) The Indian, on the other hand, wants himself to be identified.
('8', 37, 1, 17, 85815) If he does not describe himself correctly, he cannot live in this country; hence his interest will be in supplying correct particulars of his name, etc.
('8', 37, 1, 18, 85968) If his name is not on the records of the Government, he cannot live here.
('8', 37, 1, 19, 86042) It is therefore useless to demand digit impressions from him.
('8', 37, 1, 20, 86104) It can be proved to the Government with this convincing argument that taking ten impressions serves no purpose and involves unnecessary expenditure.
('8', 37, 1, 21, 86253) The argument has a scientific basis.
('8', 37, 1, 22, 86290) Hence, even after the new law is defeated, the Indian community can argue with the Government against ten impressions without fear of being called childish.
('8', 37, 1, 23, 86447) There is no such argument against the impressions of two thumbs.
('8', 37, 1, 24, 86512) Every struggle must have some substantial ground, otherwise public opinion will be against us.
('8', 37, 2, 25, 86607) JAPANESE GENTLEMAN
('8', 37, 3, 26, 86626) A Japanese student of science named Mr. Nakamura is here.
('8', 37, 3, 27, 86684) He carried with him a letter from Lord Elgin, in spite of which he was harassed by the Permit Officer.
('8', 37, 3, 28, 86787) He has been making a study of mines in every part of the world.
('8', 37, 3, 29, 86851) He had an interview with Mr. Palak, which

('8', 38, 1, 3, 86971) 1 He has promised to inform his Government about the obnoxious law.
('8', 38, 2, 4, 87039) CORRECTION

('8', 38, 5, 9, 87334) [JOHANNESBURG, December 28, 1907]
('8', 38, 6, 10, 87368) .Sharp at 10 a.m.
('8', 38, 6, 11, 87386) on Saturday last, all the Johannesburg men attended at the B. Criminal Court, where Mr. H. H. Jordan sits.
('8', 38, 6, 12, 87493) They were asked by Superintendent Vernon whether they held duly issued registration certificates under Law 2 of 1907, and upon receiving replies in the negative, they were all promptly arrested, and charged under Section 8 sub section 2 of Act 2 of 1907, in that they were in the Transvaal without a registration certificate issued under the Act.
('8', 38, 6, 13, 87840) The Court was crowded to excess and it seemed as if, at one time, the barrier would be overthrown.
('8', 38, 7, 14, 87939) Among those present were Mr. George Godfrey, Dr. M. A. Pereira, the Editor of Indian Opinion, and many other friends of and sympathisers with the accused.
('8', 38, 8, 15, 88094) Mr. P. J. Schuurman prosecuted on behalf of the Crown.
('8', 38, 9, 16, 88149) Mr. M. K. Gandhi, Attorney, Barrister at Law of the Inner Temple, Honorary Secretary of the British Indian Association of the Transvaal, was the first of the accused to be dealt with.
('8', 38, 10, 17, 88333) Superintendent Vernon, of the T.T.P., gave evidence as to the arrest.
('8', 38, 10, 18, 88403) He said the accused was an Asiatic over 16 years of age, resident in the Transvaal.
('8', 38, 10, 19, 88487) At 10 a.m.
('8', 38, 10, 20, 88498) that morning he called on Mr. Gandhi to produce his registration certificate, but he failed to do so, and said he had not got one.
('8', 38, 11, 21, 88629) Mr. Gandhi asked no questions, but went into the box, prepared to make a statement.
('8', 38, 11, 22, 88713) He said [that] what he was about to state was not evidence, but he hoped the Court would grant him indulgence to make a short explanation, seeing that he was an officer of that Court.
('8', 38, 11, 23, 88897) He wished to say why he had not submitted to this.
('8', 38, 12, 24, 88948) MR. JORDAN: I dont think that has anything to do with it.
('8', 38, 12, 25, 89006) The law is there,
('8', 38, 13, 26, 89024) 1 Not reproduced here 2 This was Gandhijis first trial in a court of law.
('8', 38, 13, 27, 89098) This report was published under the title Mr. Gandhi Ordered to Leave the Transvaal.

('8', 39, 1, 2, 89224) and you have disobeyed it.
('8', 39, 1, 3, 89251) I dont want any political speeches made.
('8', 39, 2, 4, 89292) MR. GANDHI: I dont want to make any political speeches.
('8', 39, 3, 5, 89348) MR. JORDAN: The question is, have you registered or not?
('8', 39, 3, 6, 89405) If you have not registered, there is an end of the case.
('8', 39, 3, 7, 89462) If you have an explanation to offer ad misericordiam as regards the order I am going to make, that is another story.
('8', 39, 3, 8, 89579) There is the law, which has been passed by the Transvaal legislature and sanctioned by the Imperial Government.
('8', 39, 3, 9, 89691) All I have to do and all I can do is to administer that law as it stands.
('8', 39, 4, 10, 89765) Mr. Gandhi said he did not wish to give any evidence in extenuation, and he knew that legally he could not give evidence at all.
('8', 39, 5, 11, 89894) MR. JORDAN: All I have to deal with is legal evidence.
('8', 39, 5, 12, 89949) What you want to say, I suppose is that you do not approve of the law and you conscientiously resist it.
('8', 39, 6, 13, 90054) MR. GANDHI: That is perfectly true.
('8', 39, 7, 14, 90090) MR. JORDAN: I will take the evidence if you say you conscientiously object.
('8', 39, 8, 15, 90166) Mr. Gandhi was proceeding to state when he came to the Transvaal and the fact that he was secretary to the British Indian Association when Mr. Jordan said he did not see how that affected the case.
('8', 39, 9, 16, 90364) MR. GANDHI: I said that before.
('8', 39, 9, 17, 90396) I simply asked the indulgence of the Court for five minutes.
('8', 39, 10, 18, 90457) MR. JORDAN: I dont think this is a case in which the Court should grant any indulgence.
('8', 39, 10, 19, 90545) You have defied the law.
('8', 39, 11, 20, 90570) MR. GANDHI: Very well, sir, then I have nothing more to say.
('8', 39, 12, 21, 90631) Mr. Schuurman pointed out that the accused as well as all other Asiatics had been given ample time in which to register.
('8', 39, 12, 22, 90752) It appeared that the accused did not intend to register, and, therefore, he did not think the Court should give him any long time in which to leave the country.
('8', 39, 12, 23, 90913) He must apply for an order for accused to leave the country in 48 hours.
('8', 39, 13, 24, 90986) .Mr. Jordan, in giving his decision, said the Government had been extremely lenient and yet it appeared that none of these people had registered.
('8', 39, 13, 25, 91132) They had set the law of the Colony at defiance with the result that the Government had taken that step.
('8', 39, 13, 26, 91236) He had power under the Asiatic Registration Act, the Peace Preservation Ordinance, and the Immigration Act to order the accused to leave the Colony within a certain number of days.
('8', 39, 13, 27, 91417) He had no wish to be harsh in the matter, and he did not intend to adopt the suggestion of Mr. Schuurman in regard to 48 hours.
('8', 39, 13, 28, 91545) He should make reasonable orders.
('8', 39, 13, 29, 91579) He must give Mr. Gandhi and the others time to collect their goods and chattels.
('8', 39, 13, 30, 91660) At the same time, he need not point out to Mr. Gandhi that under the law certain penalties were provided.
('8', 39, 13, 31, 91766) The minimum sentence, if the order were not complied with, was one month with or without hard labour; and if the offenders were found in the Colony seven days after that sentence expired, the minimum sentence which could be inflicted was six months.
('8', 39, 13, 32, 92016) He did hope that a little common sense would be shown in these matters, and that the Asiatic population of
('8', 40, 0, 1, 92123) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 41
('8', 40, 1, 2, 92167) the Colony would realize that they could not trifle and play with the Government.
('8', 40, 1, 3, 92249) If they did, they would find that when an individual set himself up against the will of the State, the State was stronger than the individual, and the individual suffered and not the State.
('8', 40, 1, 4, 92439) Mr. Gandhi, interrupting the Magistrate, asked him to make the order for 48 hours.
('8', 40, 1, 5, 92522) If they could get it shorter even than that, they would be more satisfied.
('8', 40, 2, 6, 92597) MR. JORDAN: If that is the case, I should be the last person in the world to disappoint you.
('8', 40, 2, 7, 92690) Leave the Colony within 48 hours is my order.

('8', 40, 4, 10, 92799) [JOHANNESBURG, December 28, 1907]
('8', 40, 5, 11, 92833) [GANDHIJI:] Are you a British subject?
('8', 40, 6, 12, 92872) [WITNESS:] I am.
('8', 40, 6, 13, 92889) Were you in the Transvaal before the war?
('8', 40, 7, 14, 92931) Yes; since 1888. Did you pay the Dutch Government 3?
('8', 40, 8, 15, 92984) I paid nothing.
('8', 40, 8, 16, 93000) You have not taken out a registration certificate under the law?
('8', 40, 9, 17, 93065) Not under any law.
('8', 40, 9, 18, 93084) Why not?
('8', 40, 10, 19, 93093) I thought it was not fit for me to take out a permit under that law, it would be very degrading.
('8', 40, 11, 20, 93190) MR. JORDAN: Why?
('8', 40, 12, 21, 93207) If I had the Act in front of me, I would point out some of the processes which I think it is not right for a British subject to submit to.
('8', 40, 12, 22, 93346) The law clearly says that we should give our ten fingers impression and then our eight fingers impression separately, and besides that our thumb impressions.
('8', 40, 12, 23, 93504) Then we have to give our fathers and mothers and childrens names..
('8', 40, 13, 24, 93571) Cross examined by Mr. Schuurman: How long have you been here?
('8', 40, 14, 25, 93633) Since 1888. I left in 1899, in October 18, and came back in 1902. I went to Natal and returned in July of 1907.
('8', 40, 15, 26, 93745) You have held meetings in reference to this Act?
('8', 40, 16, 27, 93794) After I came back, there were meetings held.
('8', 40, 17, 28, 93839) Have you persuaded the Indians not to register?
('8', 40, 18, 29, 93887) 1 After his own trial, vide the preceding item, Gandhiji defended the other accused, the first to be examined being P.K. Naidoo.
('8', 41, 0, 1, 94016) 42 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 41, 1, 2, 94057) I took an oath not to register.
('8', 41, 3, 3, 94089) It was taken at a meeting at Burghersdorp, in the Independent School, if I am not mistaken.
('8', 41, 4, 4, 94181) You do not intend to register?
('8', 41, 5, 5, 94212) I do not.
('8', 41, 6, 6, 94222) MR. JORDAN: Had you a permit to enter the country?
('8', 41, 7, 7, 94273) No, I had an authorization from the Registrar of Asiatics.
('8', 41, 8, 8, 94332) Mr. Schuurman asked for the same order, which Mr. Jordan granted.
('8', 41, 9, 9, 94398) The cases of Nawab Khan and Samandar Khan were postponed till January 3, because there was no interpreter present.
('8', 41, 10, 10, 94513) The case of C.M. Pillay was next taken.
('8', 41, 10, 11, 94553) He stated that he came to the Transvaal in 1883, and previous to the war he was Inspector of Asiatic passes and licences.
('8', 41, 10, 12, 94675) During the war, he was a commissariat officer and messenger of the Court.
('8', 41, 11, 13, 94749) MR. GANDHI: Why do you not register?
('8', 41, 12, 14, 94786) I consider that any self respecting man would not comply with the provisions of the Act, as it simply places our liberty in the hands of the Registrar of Asiatics who, in my humble opinion, is not a fit and proper person to hold this post.
('8', 41, 13, 15, 95026) The Magistrate interrupted, and said he would not listen to nonsense of that kind....He thought it was a piece of gross impertinence for a person to come there and abuse an official of the Government in that way.
('8', 41, 13, 16, 95239) He was not going to have his time wasted and the dignity of the Court lowered in that way.
('8', 41, 13, 17, 95330) It was most improper.
('8', 41, 14, 18, 95352) Mr. Gandhi said that he agreed with the Magistrate as to the impropriety of the accuseds remarks.
('8', 41, 14, 19, 95450) And he had no intention of leading evidence as to the Registrars fitness for his position.
('8', 41, 14, 20, 95541) (TO ACCUSED): Do you object to the officer or to the Act?
('8', 41, 15, 21, 95599) Mainly to the Act.
('8', 41, 16, 22, 95618) A similar order was made at the request of the Prosecutor.
('8', 41, 17, 23, 95677) Thambi Naidoo objected to registration as it placed him lower than a Kaffir, and it was against his religion.
('8', 41, 17, 24, 95787) He was a married man with five children, the eldest of whom was 13, and the youngest about 18 months.
('8', 41, 17, 25, 95889) He carried on business as a cartage contractor.
('8', 41, 18, 26, 95937) Mr. Gandhi asked that 48 hours notice only should be given.
('8', 41, 18, 27, 95997) That was all accused wanted.
('8', 41, 19, 28, 96026) Mr. Jordan said that it was not what the accused wanted but what he (the Magistrate) wanted.
('8', 41, 19, 29, 96119) The accused was a man of business, and the period would be fixed at 14 days.
('8', 41, 20, 30, 96196) Karwa stated that he had been in the Transvaal since 1888, and during the war was a military contractor, being with Sir George White at Ladysmith.
('8', 41, 20, 31, 96343) He had entered the Transvaal with a military column by way of Harrismith.
('8', 41, 20, 32, 96417) He had just placed a
('8', 42, 0, 1, 96438) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 43
('8', 42, 1, 2, 96482) thumb impression on a registration certificate under Law 3 of 1885. He refused to give his finger impressions as it was against his religion.
('8', 42, 2, 3, 96624) THE MAGISTRATE: But you have put on one ?
('8', 42, 3, 4, 96666) ACCUSED (waving his hand deprecatingly): One is all right, but ten is against my religion.
('8', 42, 3, 5, 96757) (Laughter.)
('8', 42, 4, 6, 96769) THE MAGISTRATE: As a matter of fact, I suppose you dont care whether you put on ten or five.
('8', 42, 4, 7, 96862) You only have to be told to do it.
('8', 42, 5, 8, 96897) Mr. Easton, the first of the Chinese accused, said that he was a British subject from Hong Kong.
('8', 42, 5, 9, 96994) He had also been here before the war and had paid his 3 to the Dutch Government for his certificate.
('8', 42, 5, 10, 97095) By occupation he was a store assistant, and objected to registration because it was too degrading and was against his religion.
('8', 42, 5, 11, 97223) He was not permitted by his religion Taoism to give any impressions.
('8', 42, 5, 12, 97292) He was ordered to leave within 48 hours.
('8', 42, 6, 13, 97333) Leung Quinn, Chairman of the Chinese Association, stated that he was not a British subject, but had come to the Transvaal in 1896, and obtained a permit from the Dutch Government.
('8', 42, 6, 14, 97513) In 1901 he left and returned in 1903, obtaining a permit under the Peace Preservation Ordinance.
('8', 42, 6, 15, 97610) He was a storekeeper.
('8', 42, 6, 16, 97632) He did not take out a permit because it was a law that was disgraceful to himself and his nation.
('8', 42, 6, 17, 97730) He had translated the law to his countrymen and had been expecting some such prosecution all the time.
('8', 42, 6, 18, 97833) He would be quite contented with 48 hours notice; he had made all his prepa rations.
('8', 42, 7, 19, 97918) The Magistrate insisted on giving Quinn, as he had given the Indian storekeeper, 14 days notice.
('8', 42, 8, 20, 98015) John Fortoen, the last of the accused to go into the witness box, stated that he had been in the Transvaal for about 13 years before the war, having arrived in the Transvaal with his uncle as a child.
('8', 42, 8, 21, 98216) He did not know where his uncle was, nor whether his parents were alive or not.
('8', 42, 8, 22, 98296) He was a student, and had just come back from the Hankey Institution (near Humansdorp) in Cape Colony, where he had been since 1904. He considered that South Africa was his home, and he knew no one in China.
('8', 42, 8, 23, 98504) He did not want to take out the registration certificate because it was degrading to his country and his honour.
('8', 42, 8, 24, 98617) His age was 21.
('8', 42, 9, 25, 98633) Mr. Gandhi, pointing out that this would be his last opportunity of addressing the Court, said that he would like to make a few general remarks.
('8', 42, 9, 26, 98778) He had deliberately advised all his clients to plead not guilty, so that the Court could hear from their own lips what they had to say.
('8', 42, 9, 27, 98914) They had all said something more or less with reference to the finger print system.
('8', 42, 9, 28, 98998) He asked the Court to dismiss from its mind the idea that these men did not know what they were doing.
('8', 42, 9, 29, 99101) He knew that what he was about to say could not affect the decision of the Court, but he thought it his duty to himself and his clients to make this explanation.
('8', 42, 9, 30, 99263) There were certain things in this world which one could not explain, and there were certain things in this law which men felt but could not express, and he left it to the Court to interpret the feelings of the accused with regard to the finger print system.
('8', 43, 0, 1, 99521) 44 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 43, 1, 2, 99562) Mr. Jordan, in the course of his reply, pointed out that a deputation of Indians had gone home to the Imperial Government on the very matter before them.
('8', 43, 1, 3, 99716) That deputation had, however, been in vain.
('8', 43, 1, 4, 99760) The Act to which such exception was taken had been passed by the present Legislative Assembly of the Transvaal, and the Kings assent had been obtained.
('8', 43, 1, 5, 99912) And, all sentimentality apart, he had nothing to do but to administer the law, which he had sworn to do to the best of his ability.
('8', 43, 1, 6, 100044) These people (the accused) had deliberately defied the Government and had taken up a very serious positionone which he was sorry to see any resident in this country adopt.
('8', 43, 1, 7, 100216) It had been a mistake, he had no doubt, which had been copied from the passive resisters at Home in connection with the Education Bill, and that was an attitude which had never appealed to him in any shape at all.
('8', 43, 1, 8, 100430) The laws of a country must be complied with by the people resident there, and if they could not do that, there was but one alternative such people must go somewhere else.
('8', 43, 1, 9, 100601) He could not, however, for the life of him understand, if a man put his thumb print on a registration certificateas had been done in years pastwhere the offence against his religion came in when he had to put the print of the four fingers of each hand on this certificate.
('8', 43, 2, 10, 100874) Proceeding, he referred to the practice under the Peace Preservation Ordinance, and urged that had they objected then to the thumb print, their position would have been stronger at the present time.
('8', 43, 2, 11, 101073) The registration certificates which required the thumb print had been the only mode they had for identification.
('8', 43, 2, 12, 101186) That was in the days of [the] old yellow pass which had been issued by the former Government; but all at once, when it came about that they had to register in the new form, the Asiatics simply defied the law.
('8', 43, 2, 13, 101395) Mr. Gandhi must be aware that he (Mr. Jordan) had more experience under the Peace Preservation Ordinance in the Transvaal than any other magistrate, and Mr. Gandhi must know also the big traffic that was done by the sale of the yellow certificates which rendered it difficult to trace the owner and caused an enormous amount of trouble and expense.
('8', 43, 2, 14, 101744) Coming back to the case of the youth then before the Court, he would make an order that he (the accused) must leave the Colony in seven days.
('8', 43, 3, 15, 101886) In a brief reply, Mr. Gandhi said that a distinction had always been drawn between the thumb print on the old permit and finger print under the new law.
('8', 43, 3, 16, 102039) The one was compulsory and the other was a voluntary act.
('8', 43, 3, 17, 102097) The Court, he said, was well aware that in cases where a clear thumb impression was taken, the man could be spotted and trafficking in permits had been [made] impossible.
('8', 43, 4, 18, 102268) He thanked the Court, the public prosecutor and the police for the courtesy which had been shown throughout the trials.

('8', 44, 3, 4, 102525) .They were going on with the struggle, no matter what happened to him or to anyone else.
('8', 44, 3, 5, 102614) He would certainly not change his views, and he urged the Asiatic communities to strive against the Registration Act even if it meant deportation from the Colony.
('8', 44, 3, 6, 102777) He might have been mistaken all along.
('8', 44, 3, 7, 102816) Or they might afterwards curse him.
('8', 44, 3, 8, 102852) At the present time, he held no other views but those that he had indicated.
('8', 44, 3, 9, 102929) If Gods message came to him that he had erred, he would be the first to acknowledge his fault and beg their forgiveness.
('8', 44, 3, 10, 103050) But he did not think that he would ever receive that message.
('8', 44, 3, 11, 103112) He held that it was better to leave the Colony than to lose their self respect and honour by remaining as slaves.
('8', 44, 3, 12, 103226) This was a religious struggle, and he gave them the advice he had always given themto fight to the bitter end.

('8', 44, 5, 15, 103387) JOHANNESBURG, December 30, 1907
('8', 44, 6, 16, 103419) TO THE EDITOR
('8', 44, 7, 17, 103433) THE STAR [JOHANNESBURG]
('8', 44, 8, 18, 103457) SIR, The Government are to be congratulated on boldly and honestly taking proceedings mainly against those only who have led the passive resistance movement against the Asiatic Act.
('8', 44, 8, 19, 103639) That, indeed, is the only method of testing the reality and universality of Asiatic feeling.
('8', 44, 8, 20, 103732) But among those arrested are some who have never taken an active part in the agitation, and there are also remarkable omissions.
('8', 44, 8, 21, 103861) Both these facts tell their own tale.
('8', 44, 8, 22, 103899) Some have even suggested that one or two arrests are dueto private grudge.
('8', 44, 8, 23, 103974) However, it is not my purpose, in trespassing
('8', 44, 9, 24, 104020) 1 At the conclusion of the trial, Gandhiji addressed a large gathering of Indians, Chinese and Europeans in Government Square.
('8', 44, 9, 25, 104147) Speaking first in Hindustani, he narrated what had happened at the trial.
('8', 44, 9, 26, 104221) This is a report of what he said in English to the Europeans.
('8', 44, 9, 27, 104283) 2 This appeared in Indian Opinion, 4 1 1908, as a Letter to the Press.
('8', 45, 0, 1, 104354) 46 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 45, 1, 2, 104395) on your courtesy, to deal with this phase of the question.
('8', 45, 1, 3, 104454) The arrests have synchronised with the announcement of the Royal Assent to the Immigration Act.
('8', 45, 1, 4, 104550) This shows that the Government intend to use their newly acquired power.
('8', 45, 1, 5, 104623) They have now three strings to their bow, viz., imprisonment, the stopping of trade licences, and deportation.
('8', 45, 1, 6, 104734) All these powers have been taken or given in order to enable the Government, not to stop an influx of Asiatics, because no one wants it, and the Registration Act cannot stop it; not to avoid trade competition, because every Indian submitting to the Act can have as many licences as and where he wants; but to enable them to bend Indians to their will, to force them to do violence to their conscience, in short, by delivering a crushing blow, to unman them, so that they may become as wax in their hands.
('8', 45, 1, 7, 105239) Do the colonists know that deportation under the Immigration Act is worse than ordinary deportation?
('8', 45, 1, 8, 105340) If I committed murder and were sentenced to transportation for life, I should be sent to a place where I should be housed and fed even as the few native rebels sent from Natal to St. Helena are.
('8', 45, 1, 9, 105535) But if I do not submit to the Asiatic Act I am deported, that is, put across the border or sent to India without a penny on me, if I do not possess private property, to shift for myself as best I can, the cost of deportation to be paid by me.
('8', 45, 1, 10, 105778) And if I have a family in the Transvaal, so far as the Government are concerned, they will be allowed to die of starvation.
('8', 45, 1, 11, 105902) And this, mind, is to happen to men to whom the Transvaal is their adopted home and India a foreign country for purposes of earning a livelihood.
('8', 45, 1, 12, 106048) Some of the Indians arrested are traders of nearly fifteen years standing, with wives born in South Africa and living in the Transvaal.
('8', 45, 1, 13, 106184) One Chinaman came to South Africa a mere lad, knows China only in name.
('8', 45, 1, 14, 106256) He was born and bred in Western institutions.
('8', 45, 1, 15, 106302) All the Asiatics arrested are lawful residents in possession of documents entitling them to remain in the country.
('8', 45, 1, 16, 106417) These men, because they do not violate their conscience, but violate the Asiatic Act, may not only be imprisoned, but deported, in the above fashion under a warrant signed by the Colonial Secretary!
('8', 45, 1, 17, 106616) I do not say that those who do not comply with the law, even when non compliance is due to the dictates of the conscience, should not be punished at all, but I do say that when the punishment is disproportionate to the offence, it savours strongly of barbarism.
('8', 45, 1, 18, 106878) And if the powers under the Immigration Act are exercised in respect of the Asiatic Law, an act of barbarism will have been committed in the name of the electors of the Transvaal.
('8', 45, 1, 19, 107058) Will the people of this country
('8', 46, 0, 1, 107090) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 47
('8', 46, 1, 2, 107134) chuckle with delight over such ruination of a whole people?
('8', 46, 1, 3, 107194) What will the Guild of Loyal Women say regarding wives being kept without their natural protectors?
('8', 46, 1, 4, 107294) I consider myself a lover of theBritish Empire, a citizen (though voteless) of the Transvaal, prepared to take my full share in promoting the general well being of the country.
('8', 46, 1, 5, 107471) And I claim it to be perfectly honourable, and consistent with the above profession, to advise my countrymen not to submit to the Asiatic Act as being derogatory to their manhood and offensive to their religion.
('8', 46, 1, 6, 107683) And I claim, too, that the method of passive resistance adopted to combat the mischief is the cleanest and the safest, because, if the cause is not true, it is the resisters, and they alone, who suffer.
('8', 46, 1, 7, 107886) I am perfectly aware of the danger to good government, in a country inhabited by many races unequally developed, in an honest citizen advising resistance to a law of the land.
('8', 46, 1, 8, 108062) But I refuse to believe in the infallibility of legislators.
('8', 46, 1, 9, 108123) I do believe that they are not always guided by generous or even just sentiments in their dealings with unrepresented classes.
('8', 46, 1, 10, 108250) I venture to say that, if passive resistance is generally accepted, it will once and for ever avoid the contingency of a terrible death struggle and bloodshed in the event (not impossible) of the natives becoming exasperated by a stupid mistake of our legislators.
('8', 46, 1, 11, 108515) It has been said that those who do not like the law may leave the country.
('8', 46, 1, 12, 108590) This is all very well, spoken from a cushioned chair, but it is neither possible nor becoming for men to leave their homes because they do not subscribe to certain laws enacted against them.
('8', 46, 1, 13, 108781) The uitlanders of the Boer regime complained of harsh laws; they, too, were told that if they did not like them, they could retire from the country, but they thought better and did not go.
('8', 46, 1, 14, 108970) Are Indians, who are fighting for their self respect, to slink away from the country for fear of suffering imprisonment or worse?
('8', 46, 1, 15, 109100) No, Sir, if I could help it, nothing would remove Indians from the country save brute force.
('8', 46, 1, 16, 109193) It is no part of a citizens duty to pay blind obedience to the laws imposed on him.
('8', 46, 1, 17, 109277) And if my countrymen believe in God and the existence of the soul, then, while they may admit that their bodies belong to the State to be imprisoned and deported, their minds, their wills and their souls must ever remain free like the birds of the air, and are beyond the reach of the swiftest arrow.
('8', 46, 1, 18, 109578) General Smuts, who puts trust in the tyrannical laws sanctioned by an obliging Secretary of State, forgets that those Asiatics who are
('8', 47, 0, 1, 109713) 48 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 47, 1, 2, 109754) fighting for conscience sake will not be bent by any machinery he may put in force.
('8', 47, 1, 3, 109838) If, when the leaders are withdrawn, my countrymen succumb, we shall have deserved the law.
('8', 47, 1, 4, 109929) Then, too, the cleanness of passive resistance, that is Jesus teaching resist not evil, will have been justified.
('8', 47, 2, 5, 110043) I am, etc.,

('8', 47, 5, 8, 110125) [JOHANNESBURG, December 30, 1907]
('8', 47, 6, 9, 110159) All who considered [that] this was not a religious struggle, that this was not a religious cause, did not know what religion meant.
('8', 47, 6, 10, 110291) He believed he had acquired some knowledge of most religions, and every religion taught that if a man did anything that degraded his manhood, there was no religion in him.
('8', 47, 6, 11, 110463) If religion meant communing with God, trusting in God, then he had no hesitation in saying that it was absolutely irreligious to degrade themselves in order that they might be able to earn a few pounds or pence in the Transvaal.
('8', 47, 6, 12, 110692) Even then they considered the position was not right, and proper and just.
('8', 47, 6, 13, 110767) If the Asiatics of the country had blindly followed their leaders and, immediately the leaders were withdrawn, they were going to accept the Act, then he believed they would have deserved the Act.
('8', 47, 6, 14, 110964) The key to the situation, therefore, lay in their own hands.
('8', 47, 6, 15, 111025) If they believed in the righteousness of their cause, and if they believed they were going forward, no matter what happened, nothing that General Smuts might do in this Colonynothing that the Imperial Government might sanction in the name of His Majestycould deter them one little bit from the step they had already taken.
('8', 47, 7, 16, 111348) In his own mind, he had great doubts as to the ability of the Government to put domiciled Asiatics across the border, but he was now fortified in that belief by a well reasoned opinion from the best lawyer 2 in the Transvaal.
('8', 47, 7, 17, 111574) But once more I request you not to pin your faith to Mr. Leonards opinion, or any other legal opinion that may be obtained.
('8', 47, 7, 18, 111698) In this struggle, the only opinion to which you can possibly pin your faith is that of your own conscience and communion with your God.
('8', 47, 8, 19, 111834) 1 The meeting was convened to thank Gandhiji for the services rendered by him in the crisis which faced the Asiatic communities in the Transvaal.
('8', 47, 8, 20, 111980) It was attended, among others, by about 400 permanent Chinese residents; the Acting Chairman of the Chinese Association, Mr. J. L. Wengsee, presided.

('8', 48, 3, 5, 112325) [JOHANNESBURG, December 30, 1907]
('8', 48, 4, 6, 112359) The Indians had all along offered to aid the Government in the matter of identification, but the Government had ignored their offers of assistance.
('8', 48, 4, 7, 112507) The Indians had always agreed that the Transvaal had the right to regulate and control future immigration.
('8', 48, 4, 8, 112614) What most concerned them was the position of the Indians now lawfully resident in the Transvaal.
('8', 48, 5, 9, 112711) Mr. Gandhi denied the imputation that the Indians had insulted the Government by putting the most offensive construction upon the Governments Acts.
('8', 48, 5, 10, 112859) They would warmly welcome a reference of their case to the Imperial Conference, feeling assured that the result would be a humane and satisfactory arrangement which both sides would abide by.
('8', 48, 5, 11, 113051) Mr. Gandhi complained of the excessive power given to the Government by the Immigration Restriction Act in dealing with passive resistersa power which he considered altogether disproportionate to the offence.
('8', 48, 5, 12, 113260) He anticipated that Indians who declined to register would have their trading licences refused on January 1, with the result that they would continue to trade without licences.
('8', 48, 6, 13, 113437) Mr. Gandhi mentioned that the Indians here have received telegrams from the Indian National Congress at Surat and from other quarters expressing sympathy and promising support.Reuter.

('8', 48, 7, 16, 113949) He suggested a compromise.
('8', 48, 7, 17, 113976) The Indians should offer to aid the work of identification by inoffensive means, and tender co operation in regulating immigration on terms of inoffensive registration of residents in the country.
('8', 48, 7, 18, 114173) A joint committee should be constituted, and the Indian leaders should be made responsible.
('8', 48, 7, 19, 114265) Failing an arrangement, the Indians should, as British subjects, claim from the King the protection against ill usage which His Majesty would be bound to afford them in a foreign country.

('8', 49, 2, 3, 114518) Tuesday, [December 31, 1907]
('8', 49, 3, 4, 114547) SIMULTANEOUS ARRESTS
('8', 49, 4, 5, 114568) The Government did not permit Pretoria, Pietersburg, Johannesburg and Germiston to have a quiet December.
('8', 49, 4, 6, 114674) Warrants of arrest were issued12 in Pretoria, nine in Johannesburg, three in Pietersburg and one in Germiston.
('8', 49, 4, 7, 114785) In Pretoria, summons were received by Messrs Suliman Suj, A. M. Cachalia, Ardeshir Beg, Gavarishanker Vyas, Goolam Mahomed Rashid, Ismail Jooma, Rahmat Khan, Chunilal Sheth, Tulsi, Gangadeen and Manilal Desai; in Johannesburg, by Messrs Gandhi, Thambi Naidoo, C. M. Pillay, Nawab khan, Samandar Khan, Karwa, Quinn, Easton, and Fortoen; in Pietersburg, by Messrs Mohanlal Khanderia, Amershi Gokul, and Ambalal; and in Germiston by Ram Sundar Pundit.
('8', 49, 4, 8, 115234) Of these, Rahmat Khan being out of station was not arrested.
('8', 49, 4, 9, 115295) Mr. Cachalia, as soon as he heard the news, ran down from Volksrust to Pretoria to attend the summons, leaving his work unfinished.
('8', 49, 4, 10, 115427) On the other hand, Ram Sundar made himself scarce.
('8', 49, 4, 11, 115478) Messrs Chunilal and Tulsi had their cases postponed.
('8', 49, 4, 12, 115531) It is necessary to relate the story of Ram Sundar.
('8', 49, 4, 13, 115582) That gentleman was present in Mr. Gandhis office when the Police Commissioners notice was received on Friday, and promised to attend the court on Saturday.
('8', 49, 4, 14, 115738) But after reaching Germiston, he called one or two of his disciples and told them that he was thinking of running away, since he could not face a second term of imprisonment.
('8', 49, 4, 15, 115913) The disciples expostulated with him but he was overcome with fear.
('8', 49, 4, 16, 115980) Turning a deaf ear to all that they said and without informing anyone, he quietly took the train to Natal.
('8', 49, 4, 17, 116087) Thus, his fall was as sudden as his rise.
('8', 49, 4, 18, 116129) I have written at great length about him in this paper.
('8', 49, 4, 19, 116185) All that has turned out to be mistaken.
('8', 49, 4, 20, 116225) The poems about him have been meaningless.
('8', 49, 4, 21, 116268) A bad coin will always remain a bad coin.
('8', 49, 4, 22, 116310) This is a struggle such as will expose everyone in his true colours.
('8', 49, 4, 23, 116379) So far as the community is concerned, Ram Sundar is dead henceforth.
('8', 49, 4, 24, 116448) We are to forget him.
('8', 49, 4, 25, 116470) All the others appear to be firm.
('8', 49, 4, 26, 116504) Those arrested include persons from all communities.
('8', 49, 4, 27, 116557) There are four Surati Muslims, one Memon, two Pathans, one Parsi, one Brahmin, three Banias, one Hindu from Calcutta, one Sikh, two Desais, one Lohana, three Hindus from Madras and three Chinese, making a total of 23 Asiatics who have been arrested.
('8', 49, 4, 28, 116807) From among these, Messrs Suj, Desai, was, Khanderia and
('8', 50, 0, 1, 116863) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 51
('8', 50, 1, 2, 116907) Naidoo have their families in the Transvaal.
('8', 50, 1, 3, 116952) Some of them are businessmen and some are servants.
('8', 50, 1, 4, 117004) Thus, every community has reason to congratulate itself.
('8', 50, 2, 5, 117061) WHY WERE MORE BUSINESSMEN NOT ARRESTED?
('8', 50, 3, 6, 117101) This question has been raised.
('8', 50, 3, 7, 117132) I think Mr. Essop Mia and others have not been touched for the time being because, perhaps, it is intended to harass them on the question of licences.
('8', 50, 3, 8, 117283) It is also likely that they are left untouched because some businessmen have informed the Government that they were prepared to conform to the law if pickets and other mischief mongers were removed from their path.
('8', 50, 3, 9, 117498) It appears that businessmen have not been arrested for this reason.
('8', 50, 3, 10, 117566) There are some among those arrested who have taken no part in the struggle.
('8', 50, 3, 11, 117642) It is not necessary to go into the reasons for this just now.
('8', 50, 4, 12, 117704) WHY DID IMMIGRATION ACT RECEIVE ROYAL ASSENT?
('8', 50, 5, 13, 117750) Owing to the sudden arrests, the fact of the Immigration Act having received [Royal] assent has receded into the background, and people have lost their fear about it.
('8', 50, 5, 14, 117917) I think we have ourselves provided the grounds for the assent to that law.
('8', 50, 5, 15, 117992) As I said earlier, some businessmen submitted a representation to say that they would submit to the law if certain individuals ceased interfering with the affair.
('8', 50, 5, 16, 118155) And still others approached the Registrar with exaggerated reports.
('8', 50, 5, 17, 118223) All this was perhaps transmitted to Lord Elgin in a distorted form so as to give him the impression that, if the Immigration Act were passed, everyone would register.
('8', 50, 5, 18, 118390) Is it anything to wonder at that, with such information reaching Lord Elgin, the Act should have received the assent?
('8', 50, 5, 19, 118508) It is, however, gratifying to observe that the Act appears to have left the Indian community altogether unconcerned.
('8', 50, 5, 20, 118625) SOME COWARDS All the same, a few at least have shown themselves to be cowards.
('8', 50, 5, 21, 118704) There are among them some Memons of Pietersburg who had not applied so far, but who have now sent in a petition to say that they are ready to soil their hands.
('8', 50, 5, 22, 118864) I hold on to my belief that, with increasing pressure, we would find the impurities separating out, leaving pure gold behind.
('8', 50, 5, 23, 118990) It is only those of proved worth who will pilot the ship to the haven.
('8', 50, 5, 24, 119061) It is not to be expected that those who merely protest their courage out of fear of public ridicule, but are timid at heart, will stand their ground till the end.
('8', 50, 5, 25, 119224) NO REASON FOR FEAR But their fear is groundless.
('8', 50, 5, 26, 119273) Thousands of men cannot be deported.
('8', 50, 5, 27, 119310) As for those who submit, the whites know what is in store

('8', 51, 3, 4, 119460) The editor will give elsewhere a translation of the Regulations under this Act which have been published.
('8', 51, 3, 5, 119566) For the present, I point to one thing which will cause surprise.
('8', 51, 3, 6, 119631) It is obligatory to give 10 fingerprints on the permits, passes, etc., to be issued under the Act.
('8', 51, 3, 7, 119730) The Regulations are applicable to all, whites as well as blacks.
('8', 51, 3, 8, 119795) White servants from England will be allowed into the Transvaal only if they possess such passes.
('8', 51, 3, 9, 119892) It will be realized now that the struggle against the obnoxious law is not based on the question of finger prints.
('8', 51, 3, 10, 120007) It is aimed against its implicit offensiveness.
('8', 51, 3, 11, 120055) There is nothing in the Immigration Regulations which we can complain of.
('8', 51, 3, 12, 120129) For the present, the Act can be of little profit to us.
('8', 51, 3, 13, 120185) Its provisions can be availed of only by those who have submitted to the obnoxious law.
('8', 51, 3, 14, 120273) We areonly concerned with the section relating to deportation.
('8', 51, 3, 15, 120336) But the point made above deserves attention.
('8', 51, 3, 16, 120381) Even if the requirement of finger prints were deleted, the obnoxious law would remain totally unacceptable.
('8', 51, 3, 17, 120489) It is in its very nature a poisonous law, and cannot be compared at all with any other piece of legislation.
('8', 51, 4, 18, 120598) WHO WILL TAKE MR. GANDHIS PLACE?
('8', 51, 5, 19, 120631) A question has been raised as to who will work in Mr. Gandhis absence.
('8', 51, 5, 20, 120702) I know that Mr. Polak has dedicated his life to the Indian community.
('8', 51, 5, 21, 120772) He has gone deep into this question.
('8', 51, 5, 22, 120809) He comes of a cultured family.
('8', 51, 5, 23, 120840) He weilds a powerful pen and writes excellent English.
('8', 51, 5, 24, 120895) He has come into contact with most of the whites, and is himself known to every Indian.
('8', 51, 5, 25, 120983) He will be of help in many ways.
('8', 51, 5, 26, 121016) There is no doubt about it.
('8', 51, 5, 27, 121044) Hence letters addressed to the British Indian Association will also be attended to by him.
('8', 51, 5, 28, 121135) It is desirable that, as far as possible, all communications addressed to him should be in English.
('8', 51, 5, 29, 121235) PUBLICITY TO PASSIVE RESISTANCE The cases against Indians are reported extensively in the newspaper and every paper appears to be distinctly inclined in our favour.
('8', 51, 5, 30, 121400) There are many whites who now feel ashamed of General Smuts.
('8', 51, 5, 31, 121461) The Transvaal Leader has commented sympathetically on the Indian side in regard to the recent cases.
('8', 51, 6, 32, 121562) WHAT IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN NOW ?
('8', 51, 7, 33, 121593) There are indications of an early end to the struggle.
('8', 51, 7, 34, 121648) It does not appear that any further arrest will be made.
('8', 51, 7, 35, 121705) The Government will
('8', 52, 0, 1, 121725) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 53
('8', 52, 1, 2, 121769) watch the effects of withholding licences and of the absence of Mr. Gandhi and the others.
('8', 52, 1, 3, 121860) If inspite of this, the community remains firm, it is likely that a settlement will be reached in March.
('8', 52, 1, 4, 121965) The game is entirely in our hands.
('8', 52, 2, 5, 122000) WHO CAN HARM THOSE WHOM GOD PROTECTS?
('8', 52, 3, 6, 122038) General Smuts had had to draw in the net which he had spread for the Indians.
('8', 52, 3, 7, 122116) Today (Tuesday) morning, Messrs Naidoo, Pillay, Easton, Karwa and Gandhi were to be installed in the gaol palace.
('8', 52, 3, 8, 122230) But there was 3 telephone message before 10 a.m.
('8', 52, 3, 9, 122279) to the effect that they need not go to the court at all until further notice.
('8', 52, 3, 10, 122357) For the present, then, these brave Indians will not be able to taste the joys of imprisonment.
('8', 52, 3, 11, 122452) This is, of course, no cause for exultation.
('8', 52, 3, 12, 122497) Every Indian must have realized by now that this is going to be a hard fight.
('8', 52, 3, 13, 122575) There is no escape from imprisonment.
('8', 52, 3, 14, 122613) This at least is certain.
('8', 52, 3, 15, 122639) It must be assumed that those who are not arrested now will be arrested later.
('8', 52, 3, 16, 122718) Now everyone is to hold himself in readiness, weapon in hand.
('8', 52, 3, 17, 122780) We are to follow the example of General Crongi and his army whoon one occasion held themselves in battle position with armour on for 24 hours at a stretch.
('8', 52, 3, 18, 122936) People were carried away by a wave of joy at the news that there were to be no arrests.
('8', 52, 3, 19, 123024) Mr. Gandhis office was besieged and speeches were made.
('8', 52, 3, 20, 123080) The meeting which was proceeding on the public road was interrupted by a constable who informed them that no such meeting could be held without the permission of the Town Council.
('8', 52, 3, 21, 123260) Thereupon the people dispersed.
('8', 52, 3, 22, 123292) For the present, at least, it appears that Indians are going strong.
('8', 52, 4, 23, 123361) DEPORTATION OUT OF QUESTION
('8', 52, 5, 24, 123389) Mr. Leonard has given his opinion on the section of the Immigration Act relating to deportation; it is entirely in our favour, indicating that deportation of Indians is quite impossible.
('8', 52, 5, 25, 123576) If they think of it, we shall give a fight.
('8', 52, 5, 26, 123620) If Indians have patience enough to do nothing but remain at home and put up with whatever losses may occur, everything will end well.
('8', 52, 6, 27, 123754) HOSKENS SYMPATHY
('8', 52, 7, 28, 123771) On Tuesday, Mr. Hosken went over specially to Mr. Gandhis office and expressed his sympathies with deep feeling.
('8', 52, 7, 29, 123884) He was convinced that ours was a religious struggle.
('8', 52, 7, 30, 123937) Many prominent whites are expressing the same view among themselves.
('8', 52, 7, 31, 124006) Now most of our well wishers among the whites advise us to hold out firmly.
('8', 52, 7, 32, 124082) TREACHEROUS INDIANS Reports have been received from Delagoa Bay that two self 
('8', 53, 0, 1, 124161) 54 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 53, 1, 2, 124202) seeking Indians have reached there from the Transvaal.
('8', 53, 1, 3, 124257) They promise to arrange for Mr. Chamney to visit Delagoa Bay and issue permits there, on payment of 12.10s per head.
('8', 53, 1, 4, 124374) I am sure the men are telling a lie.
('8', 53, 1, 5, 124411) Mr. Chamney cannot register anyone in that manner.
('8', 53, 1, 6, 124462) I advise every Indian to beware of such persons.
('8', 53, 1, 7, 124511) It is not merely that they cannot secure any permit, but rather that they do more harm to the community than the Government does.
('8', 53, 2, 8, 124641) FOUL PLAY BY GOVERNMENT AT DURBAN
('8', 53, 3, 9, 124675) There is a telegram that people arriving from India are given the title deed of slavery in Durban itself before they proceed to the Transvaal.
('8', 53, 3, 10, 124818) Indians at Durban send many telegrams and talk a great deal.
('8', 53, 3, 11, 124879) I have very often suggested that they should arrange for someone to meet every person arriving from India and explain the position about the law.
('8', 53, 3, 12, 125025) But it appears that no one is attending to such a simple task.
('8', 53, 3, 13, 125088) What, then, is the use of sending messages of encouragement to the Transvaal ?
('8', 53, 3, 14, 125167) I sincerely hope that there will be at least one Indian in Durban who will meet Indians as they disembarkthere and make enquiries [about their plans.
('8', 53, 3, 15, 125317) If necessary, such persons should be contacted even in Delagoa Bay.
('8', 53, 4, 16, 125385) PORT ELIZABETH
('8', 53, 5, 17, 125400) The Association at Port Elizabeth has contributed 25 to the British Indian Association, which has accepted it with thanks.
('8', 53, 6, 18, 125523) MEETING OF INDIANS
('8', 53, 7, 19, 125542) On Friday evening, there was a mass meeting in the hall of the Hamidia Society.
('8', 53, 7, 20, 125622) About a thousand people were present, all full of enthusiasm.
('8', 53, 7, 21, 125684) A resolution of protest against the Immigration Act was cabled to England.
('8', 53, 8, 22, 125759) MEETING OF CHINESE
('8', 53, 9, 23, 125778) The same evening, there was a meeting of the Chinese.
('8', 53, 9, 24, 125832) In view of the possibility of his deportation, Mr. Quinn proposed the appointment of Mr. Polak as Acting Chairman of the Association.
('8', 53, 10, 25, 125966) The proposal was accepted.
('8', 53, 10, 26, 125993) Mr. Polak addressed the meeting.
('8', 53, 10, 27, 126026) Great enthusiasm was evinced as also an earnest determination to pursue the
('8', 53, 11, 28, 126102) 1 This is at variance with the report in the English section of Indian Opinion of the same date, which says that Mr. Quinn announced the appointment of an acting Chairman during his absence, and that Mr. H. S. L. Polak was appointed Honorary Adviser to the Chinese Association.

('8', 54, 2, 3, 126452) MORE MEETINGS
('8', 54, 3, 4, 126466) Meetings were held at several places in Johannesburg.
('8', 54, 3, 5, 126520) On Monday evening, there was a meeting of the Chinese which was followed by a meeting of Madrasis.
('8', 54, 3, 6, 126619) Great enthusiasm and courage were in evidence at both the meetings.
('8', 54, 3, 7, 126687) Mr. Gandhi was present.
('8', 54, 3, 8, 126711) On Monday evening, there was a huge meeting of Indians, which was attended by representatives of the Chinese.
('8', 54, 3, 9, 126821) Mr. Essop Mia made a speech asking people to remain firm and advising them to take the places of their leaders [who might be imprisoned or deported].
('8', 54, 4, 10, 126971) MEETING IN PRETORIA
('8', 54, 5, 11, 126991) There was a meeting in Pretoria on Monday which was attended by 300 people.
('8', 54, 5, 12, 127067) Mr. Hajee Habib was in the chair.
('8', 54, 5, 13, 127101) Mr. Gandhi and four Chinese leaders had specially gone there to attend the meeting.
('8', 54, 5, 14, 127185) Speaking at the meeting Mr. Gandhi pointed to the unity of the Chinese as worthy of emulation.
('8', 54, 5, 15, 127280) If they went on doing their duty, no harm would come to them even if the Transvaal Government or the whole Empire were pitted against them.
('8', 54, 5, 16, 127420) He was confident of victory.
('8', 54, 5, 17, 127449) The real struggle had just then started.
('8', 54, 5, 18, 127490) Mr. Suj declared that he would not submit to the law, whatever the consequences.
('8', 54, 5, 19, 127571) Mr. Desai said that he would welcome deportation.
('8', 54, 5, 20, 127621) Mr. Beg pointed to the lessons of history and said that success could be achieved only through sacrifices.
('8', 54, 5, 21, 127728) Mr. Manji and others from among the audience also spoke.
('8', 54, 5, 22, 127785) Mr. Hajee Habib said that it was the last time that they would hear Mr. Gandhi speak.
('8', 54, 5, 23, 127871) However, they might be able to get him back if they remained firm after his deportation.
('8', 54, 5, 24, 127960) They ought not to be afraid of deportation or deprivation of licences.
('8', 54, 5, 25, 128031) It appears the white newspapers did not fail to notice that the meeting was not very well attended.
('8', 54, 6, 26, 128131) STAND CASE IN PRETORIA
('8', 54, 7, 27, 128154) An application was made on behalf of Mr. Ratanji Makan for the lease of a Stand in the Asiatic Bazaar.
('8', 54, 7, 28, 128257) In reply, the Town Clerk had stated that since the applicant had not registered, he was considered an unlawful immigrant.
('8', 54, 7, 29, 128379) This is how they want to tighten the ring round the opponents of the Asiatic Act.
('8', 54, 7, 30, 128461) All these are indications of our degradation.
('8', 54, 7, 31, 128507) The Transvaal Indians cannot but be roused by them to a still stronger determination to break their chains.
('8', 54, 8, 32, 128615) KENDALLS LETTER
('8', 54, 9, 33, 128631) In reply to the comments made by Mr. Jordan in the course of

('8', 55, 1, 2, 128733) his judgment, Mr. Kendall writes in The Transvaal Leader to the effect that previously Indians used to give one thumb impression, and that, too, voluntarily.
('8', 55, 1, 3, 128891) They were now being asked to give 18 impressions and this as a matter of compulsion.
('8', 55, 1, 4, 128976) Indians are justified in objecting to this on grounds of religion.
('8', 55, 1, 5, 129043) An orthodox Muslim would never consent to give all his finger prints, as that would amount to tracing an image, which was prohibited in his religion.

('8', 55, 3, 8, 129270) [JOHANNESBURG,] December 31, 1907
('8', 55, 4, 9, 129304) TO THE REGISTRAR OF ASIATICS [PRETORIA
('8', 55, 5, 10, 129343) SIR,] I have just received a letter from Delagoa Bay informing me that certain two Indians from the Transvaal are at present in Delagoa Bay representing to the people that you will be prepared to grant to thoseIndians who may want permits to enter the Transvaal such permits at Delagoa Bay, on payment to these men of 12.10s per head.
('8', 55, 5, 11, 129678) I need hardly say that I consider the Above statement to be a libel so far as you are concerned; but it is certain that the Indians in question have been making such statements with a view to preying upon gullible people.
('8', 55, 5, 12, 129900) May I, therefore, ask you kindly to inform the British Indians in Delagoa Bay, in any manner you consider fit, that they are not to accept statements made by any such people, and that permits or certificates are obtainable only at your office at Pretoria?
('8', 55, 5, 13, 130156) On my part, I have taken every precaution to warn the people through the columns of Indian Opinion and other channels.

('8', 56, 2, 3, 130400) [JOHANNESBURG,
('8', 56, 3, 4, 130415) January 3 1908]
('8', 56, 4, 5, 130431) ...two Indians, whose cases were postponed when Mr. Gandhi and the others
('8', 56, 5, 6, 130505) were dealt with first, were brought up and charged with contravening the Asiatic
('8', 56, 6, 7, 130586) Regis tration Ordinance by not being in possession of a certificate of registration....
('8', 56, 7, 8, 130674) Some thing like a thousand or 1,500 of Mr. Gandhis compatriots assembled in and
('8', 56, 8, 9, 130754) around the Court, and a subdued murmur of many voices, perfectly audible in Court,
('8', 56, 9, 10, 130837) testified to the interest taken in the proceedings.
('8', 56, 10, 11, 130889) Nawab Khan 2, an ex soldier of the Indian Army, was charged.
('8', 56, 11, 12, 130950) Mr. Gandhi did not ask any questions, and he put the accused in the witness box.
('8', 56, 11, 13, 131031) He examined him as follows:
('8', 56, 12, 14, 131059) [GANDHIJI:] You are a Jamadar?
('8', 56, 13, 15, 131090) [ACCUSED:] Yes.
('8', 56, 14, 16, 131106) You came to the Transvaal at the time of the War?
('8', 56, 15, 17, 131156) Yes, during the War.
('8', 56, 16, 18, 131177) Attached to the transport corps?
('8', 56, 18, 19, 131210) What expeditions have you served in?
('8', 56, 19, 20, 131247) Burmah, Chitral, Black Hill, Tirah Expedition (1897), and the Transvaal War.
('8', 56, 20, 21, 131324) And you were wounded three times?
('8', 56, 21, 22, 131358) Twice I was shot, and once I was cut over the eye.
('8', 56, 22, 23, 131409) 1 These cases had been postponed on December 28, 1907, when Gandhiji and some other Indians were tried.

('8', 57, 2, 3, 131813) Yes, he was Subadar Major.
('8', 57, 3, 4, 131840) Witness said he was in charge of the Native police on the C.S.A. Railways 2.
('8', 57, 4, 5, 131917) The Magistrate said the evidence did not affect the position.
('8', 57, 5, 6, 131979) MR. GANDHI: You have refused to take out a registration certificate under the new Act?
('8', 57, 5, 7, 132066) I will not take it out under the new Act.
('8', 57, 5, 8, 132108) Will you explain your reasons?
('8', 57, 5, 9, 132139) [ACCUSED :] Because it would ruin me altogether if I did so.
('8', 57, 6, 10, 132200) Mr. Jordan, in giving his decision, said the accused was not registered, and he must register.
('8', 57, 6, 11, 132295) Since the hearing of the last cases on the 28th he had been approached by both Indians and Chinese, and they had informed him that this question of the finger prints had nothing at all to do with their religion, absolutely nothing....
('8', 57, 6, 12, 132530) Mr. Jordan added that the accused was a different class of man to the ordinary coolies, the basketwallahs, and he ought to know better than to refuse to register; he ought to register.
('8', 57, 6, 13, 132715) Accused would have to leave the Colony within 14 days.
('8', 57, 7, 14, 132770) Accused, in reply to what the Magistrate had said as to his being a different class to some of his compatriots, said in this matter they were all united.
('8', 57, 7, 15, 132924) They would leave the country and go to gaol together.

('8', 57, 9, 17, 133001) Sumandar Khan, a Pathan, an ex soldier of the Indian Army, who had also at least one wound to show, was next charged with the same offence.
('8', 57, 10, 18, 133141) In reply to questions by Mr. Gandhi, Sumandar Khan said he came to this Colony with Lord Roberts.
('8', 57, 10, 19, 133239) He had previously served 30 years in the Indian Army.
('8', 57, 10, 20, 133293) He was present at the engagement at Paardekop and received a bullet wound in the right thigh.

('8', 58, 1, 2, 134324) Have you been frightened by anyone?
('8', 58, 2, 3, 134360) No, who will frighten me?
('8', 58, 2, 4, 134386) If I am even hanged I wont register.
('8', 58, 2, 5, 134423) You have just paid a visit to India?
('8', 58, 2, 6, 134460) And have just returned?
('8', 58, 2, 7, 134484) Yes, about two weeks.

('8', 58, 3, 13, 134641) This concluded the evidence.
('8', 58, 3, 14, 134670) Mr. Gandhi said the remarks that had fallen from the Bench came as somewhat of a surprise to him.
('8', 58, 3, 15, 134768) His Worship had stated that some Indians and Chinese had appro ached him and stated they were afraid to register.
('8', 58, 3, 16, 134882) Fortunately, or unfortunately, the Court had before it two soldiers who were not likely to be frightened by anybody at all, and in fact the last witness had said that he was not likely to be frightened.
('8', 58, 4, 17, 135085) MAGISTRATE: You know perfectly well, Mr. Gandhi, there is a great deal of dif ference between the plain tribes and hill tribes; this man belongs to the hill tribes.
('8', 58, 4, 18, 135250) Mr. Gandhi said there was a very great difference, but there was no question of fright at all, and if there were any question of fright the arm of the law was long enough and strong enough to protect the meanest subject in the country.
('8', 58, 5, 19, 135486) MR. JORDAN: I have no doubt it will be.
('8', 58, 5, 20, 135526) Mr. Gandhi said he did think it was futile to suggest that anyone had been fri ghtened into not taking out a registration certificate and, as one of the witnesses had said, there was absolutely no question of thumb impression or finger prints.
('8', 58, 5, 21, 135770) It was a question that touched the vitals of the community.
('8', 58, 5, 22, 135830) It was a question of compulsion or a voluntary act.
('8', 58, 6, 23, 135882) Mr. Jordan said if Mr. Gandhi liked to hold a meeting outside, he could do so.
('8', 58, 7, 24, 135961) MR. GANDHI: The Bench has led the way or otherwise I would have held my peace.
('8', 58, 8, 25, 136040) MR. JORDAN: I wont allow any more.
('8', 58, 8, 26, 136075) It has nothing to do with the case.
('8', 58, 9, 27, 136111) MR. GANDHI: I do not wish the public to leave the Court under the impression that the whole of this fight is in connection with the thumb andfinger impressions.
('8', 58, 9, 28, 136272) The whole of the fight is a struggle for liberty.
('8', 58, 10, 29, 136322) Mr. Jordan said that both Indians and Chinese had come to him and alleged they were intimidated and were frightened to go and register by a number of people and that was the reason they have for not registering.
('8', 58, 10, 30, 136534) An order was made that the accused should leave the Colony within 14 days.

('8', 59, 2, 3, 136698) Ram Sundar is no longer a pundit, and so we have had that part of his name set up in smaller type.
('8', 59, 2, 4, 136797) Pundit was a title he him self had assumed.
('8', 59, 2, 5, 136841) But now that he has lost the qualities of one, he should no longer be known by that name.
('8', 59, 2, 6, 136931) We apologize to our readers for earlier having showered praises on Ram Sundar in this journal, for having used grand epithets to des cribe him and held up his attitude to the law as an example.
('8', 59, 2, 7, 137125) 1 We are guiltless for we were misled; we were unaware of the facts.
('8', 59, 2, 8, 137194) We have a saying that no one can divine what lies in the heart of a man or in the hollow of a drum.
('8', 59, 2, 9, 137294) We could not peer into Ram Sundars heart.
('8', 59, 2, 10, 137336) We believed his professions and thought him brave.
('8', 59, 2, 11, 137387) We will continue to do so with others in future.
('8', 59, 2, 12, 137436) That is the only way for man to live in society.
('8', 59, 2, 13, 137485) It will be to claim omniscience to suspect one who is appar ently sincere, or to shun his company.
('8', 59, 2, 14, 137584) God alone knows the hearts of men.
('8', 59, 2, 15, 137619) We can only know people through their actions.
('8', 59, 2, 16, 137666) We admired Ram Sundars conduct, and it was our duty to hold it up before the people.
('8', 59, 2, 17, 137751) Now that the hypocrite has been unmasked, we have no hesi tation in exposing him to our readers.
('8', 59, 2, 18, 137848) That is our way of atoning for an unwitting error.
('8', 59, 2, 19, 137899) As far as the community is concerned, Ram Sun dar is dead as from today.
('8', 59, 2, 20, 137972) He lives to no purpose.
('8', 59, 2, 21, 137996) He has poisoned himself by his own hand.
('8', 59, 2, 22, 138037) Physical death is to be preferred to such social death.
('8', 59, 2, 23, 138093) He would have enjoyed undying fame if he had beenkilled in an accident at Germiston before the critical moment when he entrained for Natal.
('8', 59, 2, 24, 138233) But fate decreed otherwise.
('8', 59, 2, 25, 138261) Having meanly betrayed the people of Germiston, his community, himself and his family, he has fled like a coward in fear of imprisonment.
('8', 59, 2, 26, 138399) Even now we pray to God to show him the right path.
('8', 59, 2, 27, 138451) We have used bitter words, but in our heart there is compassion for him.
('8', 59, 2, 28, 138524) It would be cruel to hide his fault.
('8', 59, 2, 29, 138561) There would have been no need to publicize his faults if we had not extolled his virtues.
('8', 59, 2, 30, 138651) We still need to retain the image of Ram Sundar before our eyes.
('8', 59, 2, 31, 138716) With that image before us, we should pray constantly,O Khuda Ishwar, save us from Ram Sundars fate.
('8', 59, 2, 32, 138816) Do not give us only the semblance of courage.
('8', 59, 2, 33, 138862) Keep us on the right path till the end. When ever anyone has unworthy thoughts, let the memory of Ram Sundar startle him into self contempt and let him turn to God in prayer.We frighten children saying, Look!

('8', 60, 1, 3, 139329) Indians have a long way to go yet.
('8', 60, 1, 4, 139364) It has been given to us to wit ness the farce by Ram Sundar early in the campaign.
('8', 60, 1, 5, 139447) We ought to be grateful to him for that.

('8', 60, 3, 8, 139551) In the Transvaal the campaign has now begun.
('8', 60, 3, 9, 139596) So far the two sides have only been storing up ammunition.
('8', 60, 3, 10, 139655) The bugle has sounded, calling Indians to wake up and mount a ceaseless vigil.
('8', 60, 3, 11, 139734) This is a strug gle which the gods themselves may well come down to watch.
('8', 60, 3, 12, 139809) For we believe the Indian cause to be Gods own, and the Governments that of the Devil.
('8', 60, 3, 13, 139896) Ramchandraji could defeat the ten headed Ravan with an army of monkeys because he had right on his side.
('8', 60, 3, 14, 140001) The Indians are in the right; we therefore pledge our word that they will defeat the many headed monster which the Government is, provided, of course, they remain truthful, courageous and united.
('8', 60, 3, 15, 140197) Only cowards will take fright at the thought of what will happen because the Imperial Government has approved the Immigration Act.
('8', 60, 3, 16, 140328) We had hoped, it is true, for support from the Imperial Government.
('8', 60, 3, 17, 140396) In fact, we may still do so.
('8', 60, 3, 18, 140425) But our prayer is to God alone.
('8', 60, 3, 19, 140457) Let us see if He forsakes us.
('8', 60, 3, 20, 140487) History provides no instance of God having ever forsaken anyone; we need not then fear any such contingency.
('8', 60, 3, 21, 140596) Does it matter that the Immigration Bill has been passed?
('8', 60, 3, 22, 140654) [The penalty of] deportation has been added to [that of] imprisonment.
('8', 60, 3, 23, 140725) The two are first cousins.
('8', 60, 3, 24, 140752) If one is prepared to stay in gaol for any length of time, will one not be deported?
('8', 60, 3, 25, 140837) In prison, one is confined within four walls and feels like a caged lion.
('8', 60, 3, 26, 140911) On deportation, the roaring lion can fill the wilderness with his roars.
('8', 60, 3, 27, 140984) It is not as if God dwelt only in the Transvaal prisons.
('8', 60, 3, 28, 141041) He is with us everywhere.
('8', 60, 3, 29, 141067) Why, then, fear?
('8', 60, 3, 30, 141084) We have grown used to the idea of going to gaol.
('8', 60, 3, 31, 141133) We have overcome fear in that measure.
('8', 60, 3, 32, 141172) When we become used to the idea of deportation, we shall find it preferable [to imprisonment].
('8', 60, 3, 33, 141267) There are people who are afraid that the Government may even recover the cost of deportation from those deported.
('8', 60, 3, 34, 141381) This argument
('8', 60, 4, 35, 141395) 1 A literal rendering of the Gujarati expression which would here mean that events are poised for a climax
('8', 61, 0, 1, 141502) 62 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 61, 1, 2, 141543) betrays a lack of understanding.
('8', 61, 1, 3, 141576) If we accept loss in money by going to gaol, why not by deportation?
('8', 61, 1, 4, 141645) We have accepted such loss as inevi table.
('8', 61, 1, 5, 141688) We cannot make the best of both worlds.
('8', 61, 1, 6, 141728) Honour and money, spiritual well being and [the pleasures of] the body, happiness and misery are the opposite of each other.
('8', 61, 1, 7, 141853) The Indian community is out to accomplish a formidable task; we hope therefore that the question of money will not enter into its calculations.
('8', 61, 1, 8, 141997) The Indians of Johannesburg, Pretoria and Pietersburg were arr ested about the time when news of the Immigration Bill having been passed came in.
('8', 61, 1, 9, 142143) It was a happy augury.
('8', 61, 1, 10, 142166) The persons who were arrested had been hand picked [earlier], most of them being fearless indi viduals who put up a stiff fight against the law.
('8', 61, 1, 11, 142311) We offer them all our congratulations.
('8', 61, 1, 12, 142350) We want them to remain unyielding till the last, and keep in view the [admonitory] image of Ram Sundar 1. Let them face imprisonment.
('8', 61, 1, 13, 142484) Let them face deportation.
('8', 61, 1, 14, 142511) By the time this appears in print, they will very likely have been enthroned in gaol already.
('8', 61, 1, 15, 142605) Everything depends on a satisfactory answer to the question as to what the others will do.
('8', 61, 1, 16, 142696) General Smuts deserves to be congratu latedon the step that he has taken [of arresting the leaders].
('8', 61, 1, 17, 142797) We shall face our real test now.
('8', 61, 1, 18, 142830) If people at all set any store by their pledge, if their honour is dear to them, there can be no greater misfortune for them than submission to the new law.
('8', 61, 1, 19, 142987) We should have nothing to do with it whatever happens.

('8', 62, 3, 5, 143244) THE RECEIVER OF REVENUES JOHANNESBURG]
('8', 62, 4, 6, 143283) SIR, My Association has seen the notice in the Gazette to the effect that trading licences will not be issued to British Indians unless they can produce registration certificates under the Asiatic Law Amend ment Act No.
('8', 62, 4, 7, 143503) 2 of 1907, and undergo certain other formalities.
('8', 62, 4, 8, 143553) My Association understands, too, that several British Indians have applied for licences and formally tendered the licence fee, but that their licences have not been granted, because of the above notice.
('8', 62, 4, 9, 143756) On behalf of my Association, therefore, I beg formally to in form you that, as the large majority of British Indians have for consci entious reasons declined to submit to the Asiatic Law Amendment Act, and as it is not possible for Indian traders or hawkers to earn their liv ing otherwise than as traders or hawkers, they are reluctantly comp elled to continue their trade without proper licences.
('8', 62, 4, 10, 144155) I may further add that, should the notice regarding licences be withdrawn, andshould you be pleased to grant licences, on a notification from you, the licence fee will be immediately paid and licences taken out
('8', 62, 5, 11, 144366) 1 This was very likely drafted by Gandhiji.
('8', 62, 5, 12, 144410) 2 The date of this letter is mentioned in the reply sent by the Receiver of Revenues, who said: In reply I beg to point out to you that Indian traders who are disposed to contravene the law in the manner indicated render themselves liable to the provisions of the Revenue Licence Ordinance, 1905, which imposes heavy penalties on any persons carrying on any trade or business without being in possession of a licence, irrespective of whether the persons are offenders against the requirements of any other statute or not.
('8', 62, 5, 13, 144932) The Press notice on the subject of renewal of licences, 1908, is not of a sta tutory character, but merely an advisory notice inserted in the papers for the infor.
('8', 62, 5, 14, 145096) and guidance of the business community.
('8', 62, 5, 15, 145136) Its publication or withdrawal has no force or effect on the question at issue.
('8', 62, 5, 16, 145215) I need scarcely reiterate what it now so well understood, namely, that my action in refusing to issue licences to Asoatoc traders without production of their certificates of registration is governed by the Asiatic Law Amendment Act, 1907, Section 13,

('8', 63, 6, 7, 145675) [JOHANNESBURG] [THE EDITOR THE STAR JOHANNESBURG]
('8', 63, 7, 8, 145725) SIR, In your survey of the Asiatic question you say:
('8', 63, 8, 9, 145778) It is the possible effect on the native races, who live under differential legislation themselves which makes it impossible in our opinion for the Government to yield to agitation without loss of prestige now that things have gone as far as they have.
('8', 63, 8, 10, 146030) May one infer from this that if things had not gone as far as they have the Asiatic case would, in your opinion, be strong enough to require reconsideration?
('8', 63, 8, 11, 146188) However, whether the inference is justified or not, with your permission, I would merely deal with the religious aspect of the question.
('8', 63, 8, 12, 146325) I beg to remind you that the matter wore a religious aspect at the first mass meeting 1, at the old Empire Theatre, in the September of 1906, when the now famous solemn covenant not to submit to the Asiatic Act was, after due deliberation, made by British Indians.
('8', 63, 8, 13, 146590) The disqualification against Turkish Mahomedans on the ground of reli gion was then present in the Bill and has always been pointed out as a ground of complaint.
('8', 63, 8, 14, 146752) 2 In my humble opinion, the solemn obligation by itself constitutes sufficient religious objection against the Act.
('8', 63, 8, 15, 146868) And a State that overbears such an objection on the part of its inhabitants fails to fulfil its primary duty to respect conscientious scruples.
('8', 63, 8, 16, 147012) I shall now endeavour to place before the public the general rel igious objection.
('8', 63, 8, 17, 147095) A and B are resident in the same state.
('8', 63, 8, 18, 147135) B is charged

('8', 64, 1, 3, 147332) Although both A and B have deman ded a public inquiry into the charges, the fraud has never been pro ved; yet A and his children over the age of eight years, in common with B. are called upon to submit to a punitive measure on account of Bs alleged fraud.
('8', 64, 1, 4, 147588) If A accept that measure, and, for that matter evenB, either does violence to his religion,because he surrenders his manhood and his conscience through fear of personal inconvenience or loss.
('8', 64, 1, 5, 147780) The position of A and B is that of every Asiatic in the Colony.
('8', 64, 1, 6, 147844) This would be the essential religious objection, even if there were no binding oath and no discrimination against a particular religion.
('8', 64, 1, 7, 147981) If it be true that Asiatic feeling has been intensely roused, a concession to that feeling instead of producing an injurious effect on the Native mind, would produce a reassuring effect, in that, if the sen timents of one unrepresented class are respected, those of another such class also, it will be argued, are likely to be respected.
('8', 64, 1, 8, 148319) Prestige is a high horse which, under conceivable circumstances, may bring down the rider, if he do not take care.

('8', 64, 5, 12, 148505) [JOHANNESBURG, January 6, 1908]
('8', 64, 6, 13, 148537) Mr. Gandhi, interviewed by a Star representative this morning on the situation in general and on the statement made by the Colonial Secretary at Pretoria in parti cular, said : 2
('8', 64, 7, 14, 148716) Probably General Smuts has no notion of how difficult it made the position of Indians like myself who want to serve both the local Government and the Indian community, when he talks of all Asiatics as coolies.
('8', 64, 7, 15, 148926) Instead of trying to bridge the gulf, by such language he is only widening it.
('8', 64, 8, 16, 149005) LAW 3 OF 1885 AND PEACE PRESERVATION ORDINANCE
('8', 64, 9, 17, 149052) General Smuts has evidently mixed up Law No.
('8', 64, 9, 18, 149097) 3 of 1885 with the Peace Preservation Ordinance.
('8', 64, 9, 19, 149146) Law 3 of 1885 never stopped the immigration of Asiatics; it merely penalized Indian traders to the extent of 3. If I may go into history a bit, originally this tax upon
('8', 64, 10, 20, 149315) 1 This and the following item are both reports of the same interview.

('8', 65, 0, 1, 149431) 66 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 65, 1, 2, 149472) Indian traders was to be prohibitive, that is to say, 25. Lord Derby protested against it, and it was reduced to 3 in the amending law.
('8', 65, 1, 3, 149608) This showed that the late Mr. Krugers Government never aimed at prohi bition of Asiatic immigration.
('8', 65, 1, 4, 149709) As a matter of fact, I well remember the late President having told an Indian traders deputation that he did not mind Indians coming into the country so long as they helped his; farmers to sell their produce and he did not want Indians to remain in the country on a basis of equality.
('8', 65, 2, 5, 149994) FIRST ATTEMPT AT RESTRICTION
('8', 65, 3, 6, 150023) The restriction of immigration was only thought of after the British Government was established and the Peace Preservation Ordin ance, which was designed only to cope with disloyal people and crimi nals, was adroitly and effectively used to restrict Indian immigration.
('8', 65, 3, 7, 150293) It is necessary to bear this distinction in mind because the Asiatic Reg istration Act is improperly called an amendment of Law 3 of 1885. It inaugurates a new policy altogether so far as British Colonies are con cerned and particularly the Transvaal.
('8', 65, 3, 8, 150545) Before the introduction of the Registration Act there was no question of identification at all except in the Peace Preservation Ordinance.
('8', 65, 3, 9, 150684) If the identifcation under the Peace Preservation Ordinance was incomplete a more complete system could have been devised without any new legislation at all as was done by Captain Hamilton Fowle 1. but when there was talk of having a more systematic identification a suggestion was made that the Peace Preservation Ordinance should be amended, and a draft Bill was actually sent by Mr. Duncan 2 to Lord Elgin.
('8', 65, 3, 10, 151094) That Bill appears in the last Asiatic Blue book.
('8', 65, 3, 11, 151143) To that no one took any exception at all.

('8', 66, 1, 2, 152083) and he rejected the amendment of the Peace Preservation Ordinance, and drafted the present Registration Bill, which deals with the Asiatics as such, and treats them as a class apart.
('8', 66, 1, 3, 152266) It is this which has so irritated the Indian community.
('8', 66, 1, 4, 152322) It is perfectly true that there has been some class legislation before, but never of such a drastic type.
('8', 66, 2, 5, 152428) ALLEGED INFLUX OF ASIATICS
('8', 66, 3, 6, 152455) As regards the influx of British Indians we have always denied it so far as any organized illegal influx is concerned.
('8', 66, 3, 7, 152574) A little knowledge of the working of the Asiatic Offices ought to show that the forging of permits, after the permits adopted by Captain Fowle came into opera tion, was well nigh impossible.
('8', 66, 3, 8, 152765) What actually happened was that some times wrong men received permits, because they successfully bribed the Asiatic officers in Johannesburg.
('8', 66, 3, 9, 152907) It was after the British Indian Asso ciation had repeatedly brought this corruption to the notice of Sir Arthur Lawley 1 that these officers were removed.
('8', 66, 3, 10, 153062) When I speak of wrong men I do not mean men who were not entitled to permits, but men who had not the prior right.
('8', 66, 3, 11, 153177) I know several old refugees who were obliged to make these payments before they could get their permits.
('8', 66, 3, 12, 153282) All the same such documents were bona fide documents and held by the persons described in them.
('8', 66, 3, 13, 153378) It was the touts of these officers who handled the enormous sums of money.
('8', 66, 4, 14, 153453) A DENIAL
('8', 66, 5, 15, 153462) I do deny that thousands of Indians who had no right to enter the country have so entered.
('8', 66, 6, 16, 153553) The interviewer drew Mr. Gandhis attention to Mr. Smuts statement that 5,000 Indians had gone out of the country rather than register, and the latter replied that the majority of these had every right to remaintheir right could not be questionedbut they were not strong enough to face the trouble.
('8', 66, 6, 17, 153851) The prosecutions, numbering 1,500 during a period of five years, go to show that the Indian contention is correct, namely, that whenever an attempt has been made the Peace Preservation Ordinance has been sufficient to cope with it.
('8', 66, 6, 18, 154083) It should also be remembered that most of these prosecutions were at the border in connection with men who were trying to enter but failed.
('8', 66, 6, 19, 154223) It may be as well to mention that 563 convictions took place between November 15, 1902, and Febru ary 28, 1903. It should be within the recollection of the public that immediately after peace was declared, although there was a Peace Pre servation Ordinance, people came in freely.
('8', 66, 6, 20, 154504) So did Indians and they were not molested at all.
('8', 66, 6, 21, 154554) When a large number of refugees began to

('8', 67, 0, 1, 154638) 68 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 67, 1, 2, 154679) pour in instructions were sent that no Indians should be allowed to enter without permits.
('8', 67, 1, 3, 154770) This accounts for the prosecutions during that period.
('8', 67, 1, 4, 154825) It is quite apparent therefore that there was no fraud but mere ignorance on the part of poor Indians.
('8', 67, 1, 5, 154928) In any case the number of Indians resident before the war was 15,000. Thirteen thousand permits have been issued under the Peace Preservation Ordinance to British Indians, so we have not reached the number who were in the country before the war.
('8', 67, 2, 6, 155174) THE FINGER PRINTS
('8', 67, 3, 7, 155192) Asked had he any further remarks to make on the finger print, Mr. Gandhi said: General Smuts has been less than unfair in his allusion to the system.
('8', 67, 3, 8, 155342) He knew that the fingerprints had never been an essential objection.
('8', 67, 3, 9, 155411) All digit impressions will undoubtedly form a bone of contention, be cause, according to Henrys book, on which General Smuts has relied, digit impressions are required only from criminals who continually hid[e] their identity, and, therefore, necessitate classification.
('8', 67, 3, 10, 155682) As is clearly shown in the book, thumb impressions are quite enough to identify.
('8', 67, 3, 11, 155763) An Indian, if he dared to hide his identity, would imme diately be a prohibited immigrant, because his name will not appear in the immigrants list.
('8', 67, 3, 12, 155911) It is to the advantage of the immi grant to afford every facility to show that he is the proper person.
('8', 67, 4, 13, 156015) THE CHIEF OBJECTIONS
('8', 67, 5, 14, 156036) The chief objections to the Act are that it is based on an un proved charge.
('8', 67, 5, 15, 156113) It is an attempt to have class legislation of a degrading type, and the Indian community have rightly or wrongly, after theutmost deliberation, bound themselves by a solemn oath 1 not tosub mit to it.
('8', 67, 5, 16, 156314) All these things clearly show that there is a complete mis understanding between the Government and the community affected by the Registration Act.
('8', 67, 5, 17, 156462) We deny the charges made against us.
('8', 67, 5, 18, 156499) We have often humbly approached the Government for a judicial inq uiry.
('8', 67, 5, 19, 156571) 2 Surely even now it is not too late to prove the charges if they are capable of being substantiated.
('8', 67, 5, 20, 156673) Why, for instance, should not a Judge of the High Court or the Chief Magistrate of Johannesburg be appo inted to take evidence on the following points: (1) Has there been a surreptitious entry on an organized scale?
('8', 67, 5, 21, 156889) (2) Is the Peace Preser vation Ordinance sufficient to meet any attempt at fraud?
('8', 67, 6, 22, 156971) 1 The reference is to Resolution IV passed at mass meeting of September, 1906; vide The Mass Meeting, 11 11 1906 2 Vide Interview to the Tribune, 20 10 1906, Interview to the Morning Leader, 20 10 1906, Letter to the Times, 22 10 1906,Representation to Lord Elgin,31 10 1906 & Deputation to Lord Elgin, 8 11 1906

('8', 68, 1, 2, 157328) (3) Are ten finger prints req uired for complete identification?
('8', 68, 1, 3, 157393) (4) Is it not possible to have a com plete identification by slightly amending the Immigration Restriction Act?
('8', 68, 2, 4, 157505) With regard to the fourth point, he pointed out that they could not have the Peace Preservation Ordinance permanently on the Statute book, but the Immigration Restriction Act could be easily amended so as to enable the Government to issue certi ficates of domicile to all Asiatics, who would otherwise be prohibited immigrants.
('8', 68, 2, 5, 157833) Such an amendment would avoid the sting of compulsion and unnecessary class legislation and would certainly be considered protective legislation.
('8', 68, 3, 6, 157979) INTIMIDATION
('8', 68, 4, 7, 157992) Continuing, Mr. Gandhi said: With regard to intimidation, I can only say that there has been no phy sical violence whatsoever; ostracism and boycotting, yes !
('8', 68, 4, 8, 158151) But so long as the Indians remain passive resisters I see no escape from such a course.
('8', 68, 4, 9, 158239) I speak from personal experience when I state that even Indians who have registered have done so because they have not been able to rise superior to their desire to remain in the Colony at any cost, and it is not because they like the Act that they have registered.
('8', 68, 4, 10, 158505) One of the first registrants has written a long letter to Indian Opinion regretting that he had to register, and encouraging the community in general to go on with the struggle, and wishing it success.
('8', 68, 4, 11, 158707) I hold sev eral of such letters privately written by those who have already regis tered, and in boycotting have we not taken a leaf out of the Boer book?
('8', 68, 4, 12, 158861) I do not think we have gone so far as the Boers did in con nection with the National Scouts.
('8', 68, 5, 13, 158954) GENERAL SMUTS STATEMENT
('8', 68, 6, 14, 158978) Mr. Gandhi further said: With regard to the leaders having deceived the community, I regret that General Smuts has made such a statement.
('8', 68, 6, 15, 159116) I can say without fear of contradiction that the law has been [ac] curately and widely dis tributed among the people.
('8', 68, 6, 16, 159234) That translation by itself has proved a most powerful argument.
('8', 68, 6, 17, 159298) Every attempt has been made to place before the British Indians what the leaders have considered a true stat ement regarding the law.
('8', 68, 6, 18, 159432) If by urging the people to rely on Imperial protection, we have misled, I plead guilty; but I fear that I shall always ask my countrymen to rely on that protection until Lord Elgin proves by actual action that when our handful of British Indians cry for protection against an indignity made in the name of the King and Emperor they are to be thrown overboard without a finger being lifted in order to save them.
('8', 68, 6, 19, 159844) It may be superstition, but I propose to cherish it.
('8', 68, 6, 20, 159897) My ideaand even in bringing this statement before my
('8', 69, 0, 1, 159950) 70 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 69, 1, 2, 159991) country men I have always coupled it with anotheris that our ultimate reli ance should be on God.
('8', 69, 1, 3, 160089) It may be that I have misread my country men.
('8', 69, 1, 4, 160135) I certainly welcome the prosecution against some of the leaders of the movement.
('8', 69, 1, 5, 160216) It will show General Smuts, the public, and even myself whether the opposition to the law is general or whether it is continued only through the influence of two or three Indians.
('8', 69, 1, 6, 160396) The Indians do not want victory for the sake of it.
('8', 69, 1, 7, 160448) No matter what may be said against them, they simply call themselves a law abiding people.
('8', 69, 1, 8, 160539) All they want is that their solemn covenant should be respected.
('8', 69, 1, 9, 160604) They want to help the Government, and they would still humbly approach the Government, if only the Government would have more regard for their sentiments.

('8', 69, 3, 12, 160816) [JOHANNESBURG, January 6, 1908]
('8', 69, 4, 13, 160848) A representative of The Leader waited upon Mr. Gandhi yesterday and sought from him an expression of opinion upon General Smuts speech at Mayville on Saturday last 1.
('8', 69, 5, 14, 161015) Mr. Gandhi in expressing his willingness to discuss the matter, said: I wish to make it clear that Indians have no desire to oppose General Smuts or any Colonist, or to place any obstacles in the way of an honourable compromise.
('8', 69, 5, 15, 161244) The Indians recognize that the only con dition on which they can remain in the country is to work smoothly and amicably, and to understand their limitations also.
('8', 69, 5, 16, 161407) They have always, I venture to think, worked on that basis, and, no matter what may be now said to the contrary, they still remain law abiding resi dents of the Transvaal.
('8', 69, 6, 17, 161579) 1 January 4, 1908. General Smuts had made the following points among others: (I) Mr. Gandhi had argued that the Asiatic Act was class legislation but the whole subject had been dealt with as class legislation since 1885, and the Indians had submitted to it; (2) the law had not been passed for chasing the Asiatics out of the country who had been there for 10, 15 or 20 years but to recognize all Asiatics who were in the country before the war and to stop further immigration; (3) no parliament in the country was capable of repealing the Act; (4) they had the British Government with them and he saw no reason why it should not continue to assist the Transvaal; (5) if the Indians did not submit to the law they must take the consequences.
('8', 69, 6, 18, 162321) They could be refused licences, placed in prison (about 9,500 of them) which would not be very effectual, or put over the border.
('8', 69, 6, 19, 162451) The Indians had been misled by their leaders and the Government had arrested these.
('8', 69, 6, 20, 162535) If they came forward not as individuals but as a whole to be registered then the opportunity would be given them.
('8', 69, 6, 21, 162649) However, he was not expressing the opinion of the Government but his own.
('8', 70, 0, 1, 162723) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 71
('8', 70, 1, 2, 162767) [INTERVIEWER:] How does that agree with their present attitude of passive resistance?
('8', 70, 1, 3, 162853) [GANDHIJI:] Passive resistance is merely a respectable protest against what they, rightly or wrongly, consider to be a degradation and an offence to religious feeling.
('8', 70, 1, 4, 163021) The whole speech of General Smuts unfortunately shows that there is absolutely no desire on his part to consult or to reconcile Indian sentiment.
('8', 70, 1, 5, 163167) I say without hesitation that he has not mastered his facts.
('8', 70, 1, 6, 163228) For instance, he talks of the oft denied influx of Asiatics into the country on an organized scale.
('8', 70, 1, 7, 163328) Speaking for British Indians, I deny it in toto.
('8', 70, 1, 8, 163377) This does not mean that some Indians have not surreptitiously entered this country, but all these can be effectively dealt with, even today, under the Peace Preservation Ordinance.
('8', 70, 1, 9, 163558) Those who remain in the country without permits, or with false permits, can only be hiding themselves in nooks and corners, and those will never be reached by the Asiatic Law Amendment Act.
('8', 70, 1, 10, 163748) It is not likely that those who have no permits or those who hold docu ments which are not permits at all, will go to the Registrar in order to receive notice to quit.
('8', 70, 2, 11, 163916) THE SURREPTITIOUS INFLUX
('8', 70, 3, 12, 163941) The allegation as to the surreptitious entering is based on the report 1 that was published last year.
('8', 70, 3, 13, 164044) That report condemns itself, and, if any thing, proves the contrary; 1,500 prosecutions during live years show the effective working of the Peace Preservation Ordinance, and that was the deduction drawn from it by Captain Hamilton Fowle in his report to Lord Milner.
('8', 70, 3, 14, 164311) Any Indian found without a permit in the Colony can be almost summarily removed, and, if he does not leave the Colony, soon finds himself in gaol.
('8', 70, 3, 15, 164458) Most of the prosecutions, how ever, were in connection with Indians who were trying to enter the country, who were successfully prevented from so doing by strict ins pection at the border towns.
('8', 70, 3, 16, 164653) Nor were those Indians necessarily ende avouring to enter fraudulently.
('8', 70, 3, 17, 164725) They were, in the initial stages, trying to do so under the false belief, shared by many Europeans, that under the British flag there could be no difficulty in them [sic] entering, or rather re entering, the Transvaal, for most of those were Indian refugees waiting at the coast towns for an opportunity of re entering.
('8', 70, 3, 18, 165045) General Smuts talks of forged permits, and in the same breath says it is difficult to say when a permit is forged and when it is gen uine.
('8', 70, 3, 19, 165184) This is preposterous.
('8', 70, 3, 20, 165206) The permit officials always had counter foils containing the same numbers as given on the permits issued to applicants, so that a forgery could always be detected.
('8', 70, 3, 21, 165370) I know that a
('8', 70, 4, 22, 165384) 1Vide Chamneys Report, 13 4 1907 & Johannesburg Letter, 13 4 1907
('8', 71, 0, 1, 165450) 72 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 71, 1, 2, 165491) few months ago an official from the present Registrars Office circu lated some documents which he called permits.
('8', 71, 1, 3, 165605) The dupes were never able to use those documents at all.
('8', 71, 1, 4, 165662) They not only lost their money, but their honour.
('8', 71, 1, 5, 165712) That official is now no longer in the country, but, I believe, left it after he had sufficiently fleeced the people, and after he saw that the fraud was likely to be found out.
('8', 71, 1, 6, 165889) There never was an office either in Bombay or Delagoa Bay, or in any other place, where the traffic alleged by General Smuts could possibly take place.
('8', 71, 1, 7, 166041) Touts there undoubtedly were, not in India, but in South Africa, who gave real permits from the Asiatic Office in Johannesburg to refugees, and, in some instances, others who wanted to enter the country.
('8', 71, 1, 8, 166245) THE PERMIT FRAUD The fraud was committed in this way.
('8', 71, 1, 9, 166299) The Asiatic officials in Johannesburg submitted the names to the Colonial Secretary as proper applicants for permits.
('8', 71, 1, 10, 166417) The Colonial Secretary sanctioned the granting of such permits.
('8', 71, 1, 11, 166481) These names, however, were often faked, though the permits were properly issued and bore proper thumb impressions, or signatures.
('8', 71, 1, 12, 166611) In such manner men who were entitled to enter the country had to pay large sums before they could come in, or before their claims were considered.
('8', 71, 1, 13, 166758) This was three times brought to the notice of Sir Arthur Lawley, who, at last, ordered a prosecution, which proved abortive, but the officials concerned were dismissed, because the charge was proved against them, so far as the department was concer ned.
('8', 71, 1, 14, 167012) But these things show how effective the Peace Preservation Ordinance was.
('8', 71, 1, 15, 167086) It confuses the issue to talk about Law 3 of 1885 in connection with the influx, and to describe it as inadequate.
('8', 71, 1, 16, 167201) That law was never intended to control Asiatic immigration.
('8', 71, 1, 17, 167261) It simply says, Those who settle in the Republic for the purpose of carrying on any trade or otherwise shall be bound to have their names entered in a register. Thus it was merely to exact a poll tax from those who wished to trade in the Transvaal, for Indians were not even bound to register or pay anything.
('8', 71, 1, 18, 167571) Asiatic immigration was as free as European immigration.
('8', 71, 1, 19, 167628) The question of restricting such immigration was raised after peace was declared, and the Peace Preservation Ordinance was then utilized, quite improperly) to check Asiatic entry.
('8', 71, 1, 20, 167808) For some reason or other it was suggested that the Peace Preservation Ordinance should be amended.
('8', 71, 1, 21, 167907) The Draft Amendment appears at page 9 of the Blue book, Legislation affecting Asiatics in the Transvaal, published last 1 year.
('8', 71, 1, 22, 168035) That would have been quite proper, and British Indians could not have complained.
('8', 71, 1, 23, 168117) A Draft Amendment of Law 3 of 1885 was also suggested at the same time.
('8', 71, 2, 24, 168189) 1 Actually, it was published in January 1908; vide Blue Book,29 2 1908
('8', 72, 0, 1, 168260) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 73
('8', 72, 1, 2, 168304) POLICY SUDDENLY CHANGED It was quite of a mild type, but suddenly the whole thing was changed, and I believe it was Mr. Lionel Curtis who, after all, changed the whole scope and tenor of such legislation, and who sprung upon the community the draft of the Asiatic Amendment Ordinance, now sanctioned as an Act.
('8', 72, 1, 3, 168615) It is a misnomer to call it an Amendment of Law 3 of 1885; it really makes a change in the whole Asiatic policy.
('8', 72, 1, 4, 168728) Class legislation affecting Asiatics has been passed before now, and not much has been heard against it, but the Asiatic Registration Act is absolutely a novel thing, and, based as it is on the false charge above referred to, can never be accepted by the Indian community, more so as the community is bound by a solemn declaration.
('8', 72, 1, 5, 169060) It is surprising to me that General Smuts has persistently igno red these things, and asked British Indians to violate their consciences.
('8', 72, 1, 6, 169198) One would have thought that he, as representing a very strong Gov ernment and an overwhelmingly large number of Europeans, would have sufficient grace and condescension to respect Indian sentiment, so long as he got the essential thingviz., identification of every Indian or m Asiatic residing in the Colony.
('8', 72, 1, 7, 169507) These he could have had six months ago, and can have even now.
('8', 72, 2, 8, 169570) But, Mr. Gandhi, the assertions of General Smuts are very different from yours.
('8', 72, 2, 9, 169650) Quite so.
('8', 72, 2, 10, 169660) I may be told that mine are merely counter assertions, and that General Smuts must be saying what he knows to be true.
('8', 72, 2, 11, 169779) I do not ask that the assertions made by the Indian community should be, ipso facto, accepted, but I do say that what I have stated above furnishes sufficient ground for a judicial and open enquiry.
('8', 72, 2, 12, 169978) No reasonable Colonist can take exception to it, and if in the course of that enquiry, it is found that the charges of an influx and statements as to the inadequacy of the Peace Preservation Ordinance are proved there will be something to be said for the Asiatic Registration Act.
('8', 72, 2, 13, 170259) If, however, the finding of such a commission is in favour of the Indian contention, why should not a strong Government, which also claims to deal with British Indians fairly and justly, acknowledge its mistake and retrace its steps?
('8', 72, 3, 14, 170493) FINGER PRINTS
('8', 72, 4, 15, 170507) In reply to a question as to what was the real objection to finger prints, Mr. Gandhi remarked that a lot of good ink and paper had been devoted to this subject, but it had never formed an impossible barrier.
('8', 72, 4, 16, 170716) As a matter of fact, thumb impressions have been given voluntarily.
('8', 72, 4, 17, 170784) There is, however, a very serious objection to simultaneous digit impressions, because they have the ring of criminality.
('8', 72, 4, 18, 170906) According to
('8', 73, 0, 1, 170919) 74 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 73, 1, 2, 170960) E. R. Henrys book, simultaneous digit impressions are required only for classifying criminals; thumb prints are asked for from illiterates in several departments in India.
('8', 73, 1, 3, 171132) But the deadlock is created by the Asiatic Act itself.
('8', 73, 1, 4, 171187) Objections were raised before the regulations were published and promulgated.
('8', 73, 2, 5, 171265) Asked to give a statement upon General Smuts references to intimidations Mr. Gandhi said the intimidation simply resolved itself into social ostracism against those Indians who had taken out registration certificates, and he very much feared that such ostracism could not be prevented.
('8', 73, 2, 6, 171551) Asiatics who had registered themselves had acknowledged more than once that they had done an improper act.
('8', 73, 2, 7, 171658) It was fear that dictated the course, and not their respect for the law.
('8', 73, 2, 8, 171731) General Smuts remark as to deception by the leaders was unfortunate.
('8', 73, 2, 9, 171800) So far as I am aware, no leader has misled any Indians.
('8', 73, 2, 10, 171856) The Asiatic law has been translated and distributed broadcast.
('8', 73, 2, 11, 171919) The protection of the Imperial Government has certainly been placed before the Indian community, and so long as I retain my faith in the Imperial Government and British justice, I shall continue to place it before my countrymen until I find that the whole of the Indian community has been entirely abandoned by the King Emperor, in spite of previous promises to the contrary.
('8', 73, 2, 12, 172295) General Smuts has seen fit to describe our respectable community as a community of coolies.
('8', 73, 2, 13, 172387) It must not be supposed that Indians do not know these things, or that they do not feel them.
('8', 73, 2, 14, 172481) Every word that General Smuts has said has been greedily devoured by British Indians, and those who could not read have listened to the translations 1. Needless to say, those remarks naturally offended them, and so long as he holds British Indians so cheap and denies them the full status of British subjects, so far as their possible freedom and personal movements are concerned, so long must Indians rest content with imprisonment or deportation.
('8', 73, 3, 15, 172930) THE LEADERS
('8', 73, 4, 16, 172942) I cannot help congratulating him upon having laid his hands upon the leaders.
('8', 73, 4, 17, 173020) He will then find out for himself whether the Indian opposition is real or false.
('8', 73, 4, 18, 173102) The question is: Will he do justice alter he finds out the guilty, or will he then put forth the enormous strength he possesses in order to crush a handful of Indians who have never done any harm to any portion of the Transvaal community?
('8', 73, 4, 19, 173341) Talking of leaders, I must deny that all those who have been arrested have taken a leading part in the agitation.
('8', 73, 4, 20, 173455) Some of them have never been known to have done anything in connection with the Act, and why should those who are in the employ of the Government be intimidated into

('8', 74, 1, 2, 173709) registering, on pain of being dismissed [?] I am proud to say that most of the Indian employees of the Governmentsome of them of long standinghave accepted dismissal rather than register.
('8', 74, 1, 3, 173897) But if it is true that the agitation has been kept up only by the leaders, why has this extreme procedure been adopted of dismissing even the Indian labourers working on the railways?
('8', 74, 2, 4, 174081) THE IRREVOCABLE LAW
('8', 74, 3, 5, 174101) Mr. Gandhi then drew attention to General Smuts concluding remarks, and said he had there laid down a proposition which, if it were to hold good generally, would mean the end of all agitation, healthy or otherwise.
('8', 74, 3, 6, 174316) General Smuts [had] said that no law could be altered owing to agitation.
('8', 74, 3, 7, 174390) Without taking into consideration general laws, affecting all com munities, I can cite the instance of the Natal Franchise Law having to be altered on reasonable opposition by the Indian community and on representations by the then Colonial Secretary, and this after Natal received self government.
('8', 74, 3, 8, 174689) The Natal Municipal Act still awaits Imperial sanctions 1 In my humble opinion the real strength of the British Empire lies in honourable compromise and in paying regard to the rights and complaintsof minorities, especially when those minorities are weak or unrepresented.
('8', 74, 3, 9, 174962) At the time of introducing the Transvaal Municipal Ordinance, Sir Richard Solomon cited the instance of the Coloured people having rejected the Pass Law.
('8', 74, 3, 10, 175116) That law, so far as I am aware, has never been enforced against them.
('8', 74, 4, 11, 175186) What of the numerous interviews the leaders of the Indian community have had with General Smuts?
('8', 74, 4, 12, 175283) Could you come to no friendly understanding?
('8', 74, 4, 13, 175328) There have not been numerous interviews, so far as I am aware.
('8', 74, 4, 14, 175391) I only know of one 2, but I do know that he has repeatedly rejected all advances from British Indians.
('8', 74, 4, 15, 175494) It is perfectly true that each time an approach has been made it has been with a view to a repeal of the Asiatic Act.
('8', 74, 4, 16, 175612) There can be no other course possible for Indians who believe in God, and who are bound by their solemn declaration taken after having had everything placed before them.
('8', 74, 5, 17, 175782) THE WAY OUT
('8', 74, 6, 18, 175794) Is there no honourable way out of the present difficulty?
('8', 74, 6, 19, 175852) Yes, Indians have always offered to fulfil the essential object of the Act, viz., to give every facility to the Government for complete identification of British Indians entitled to remain in the Colony.
('8', 74, 7, 20, 176056) 1Vide Natal Municipal Bill, 23 2 1907 2 Vide Johannesburg Letter, 13 4 1907
('8', 75, 0, 1, 176132) 76 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 75, 1, 2, 176173) could have been done voluntarily under the Peace Preservation Ordi nance.
('8', 75, 1, 3, 176247) Now that that Ordinance is virtually repealed, and must be totally repealed if the Asiatic Act is also repealed, the only practical way out of the difficulty is to amend, during the next session of Parliament, the Immigration Restriction Act, so as to embody the necessary clauses for identification, regard being had to the statements always made by the Indian community with reference to minors under 16, and with reference to those who can pass the education test under the Act, which is severe enough.
('8', 75, 2, 4, 176753) Asked to elaborate his proposal, Mr. Gandhi said the Immigration Restriction Act, which contains the drastic power of deportation under the hand of the Minister, is ample for every purpose.
('8', 75, 2, 5, 176943) Let the Asiatic Law Amendment Act of 1907 be entirely withdrawn, and the Immigration Restriction Act be slightly amended so that every Asiatic would become a prohibited immigrant.
('8', 75, 2, 6, 177123) That was to say, he would then have to prove that he was entitled to remain in the Colony.
('8', 75, 2, 7, 177214) If he could produce his certi ficate issued to him under the Peace Preservation Ordinance, or under Law 3 of 1885, he would be given a certificate of domicile, which would take the place of his former certificate, and other documents at present held, and this new certificate of domicile should contain ample proofs of the identity of the holder.
('8', 75, 2, 8, 177561) Children under the age of 16 should not be required to take out certificates of domicile, but a complete enumera tion of such children would be detailed, together with their names, on the certificates of domicile issued to their parents and guardians.
('8', 75, 2, 9, 177813) The Immigration Act already con tains sufficiently drastic provisions against trafficking in these certificates of domi cile.
('8', 75, 2, 10, 177939) This scheme, Mr. Gandhi contended, would give the Govern ment all that they reasonably requiredviz., it would prevent any further immi gration of Asiatics, and would ensure complete identification and registration of all Indians and Asiatics enti tled to remain here.
('8', 75, 2, 11, 178207) Thus the wishes of the Government and the people of the Trans vaal would be fully met without putting any unnecessary affront upon the Indians.
('8', 75, 2, 12, 178351) It has been often said that the Transvaal, being an inland Colony, cannot have an Immigration Act like the Cape or Natal.
('8', 75, 2, 13, 178473) That, in my opinion, is a mistake.
('8', 75, 2, 14, 178508) What is meant is that the Immigration Act of the Transvaal should provide for stricter identification than the Natal Act.
('8', 75, 2, 15, 178630) According to the Natal Act, any Indian can at any time prove his domicile and demand entry.
('8', 75, 2, 16, 178722) Under the amendment suggested by me, every Indian would have to prove his domicile, or his right of resi dence in the Transvaal, within a stipulated time, after which he would be for ever stopped.
('8', 75, 2, 17, 178919) Surely nothing more than this can be required?

('8', 76, 2, 3, 179067) [JOHANNESBURG] January 8, 1908]
('8', 76, 3, 4, 179099) Mr. Gandhi declared today that he would undertake, if the operation of the Asiatic Registration Act were suspended, that every Indian in the country would be registered in a months time, in accordance with a form to be mutually agreed upon.
('8', 76, 3, 5, 179340) The Act would then be unnecessary, and could be withdrawn.
('8', 76, 4, 6, 179399) If his promise were not faithfully carried out, he would undertake to assist the Government in the strict enforcement of the present Act.
('8', 76, 4, 7, 179537) The main object of the Indian leaders was to eliminate the element of compulsion.
('8', 76, 4, 8, 179619) The compromise sugges ted was the only one the Indians were prepared to accept, and an effort would probably be made to arrange for a discussion of its terms with the Government.
('8', 76, 4, 9, 179798) The Indian community considered that his suggestion that a High Court Judge should hold an enquiry into the surreptitious entry of Indians into the Transvaal and the question of identification would give the Government an opportunity of reviewing the situation.

('8', 76, 6, 12, 180104) [Before January 10, 1908] 3
('8', 76, 7, 13, 180132) General Smuts has spoken at length.
('8', 76, 7, 14, 180168) The Star and [The Trans vaal] Leader have published an interview 4 with Mr. Gandhi by way of a reply.
('8', 76, 7, 15, 180270) We print elsewhere a translation of that reply.
('8', 76, 7, 16, 180318) It is a remark able speech.
('8', 76, 7, 17, 180346) The aggressive spirit that General Smuts showed four months ago has now disappeared.
('8', 76, 7, 18, 180431) In the course of the speech, he asks at one point how thousands of Indians can be imprisoned.
('8', 76, 7, 19, 180525) Where are the gaols [in requisite number]he asksand how can so many per sons be deported either?
('8', 76, 7, 20, 180622) At another place, he asserts that, if the Ind ians do not register, the Government may even adopt the measure [of deporting them] as a last resort.
('8', 76, 7, 21, 180770) General Smuts Is not sure whether the Imperial Government will continue to be as obliging as it has been.
('8', 76, 7, 22, 180876) He adds, however, that these are his personal views.
('8', 76, 7, 23, 180929) He does not know what the colonial Government will do.
('8', 76, 7, 24, 180984) A speech such as this is merely

('8', 77, 1, 2, 181442) the raving of a madman.
('8', 77, 1, 3, 181466) General Smuts is an angry man.
('8', 77, 1, 4, 181497) Not being in his right mind, he says whatever comes into his head.
('8', 77, 1, 5, 181564) He shows open contempt for the Indians, referring to them as coolies.
('8', 77, 1, 6, 181634) He says that we are British subjects only to a certain extent.
('8', 77, 1, 7, 181697) This is something new.
('8', 77, 1, 8, 181720) Till today we were British subjects, but now we are British subjects only to a certain extent.
('8', 77, 1, 9, 181815) He declares, furthermore, that till now the Imperial Government had stood in the way of our being relegated to Locations.
('8', 77, 1, 10, 181937) Now he hopes that it will be easier to send Indians to Locations.
('8', 77, 1, 11, 182003) And he adds that, after Mr. Gandhis arrest 1, many Indians told him that they were prepared to take out registers [under the law].
('8', 77, 1, 12, 182134) What does all this mean?
('8', 77, 1, 13, 182159) It is evident that the Indian community has given General Smuts a few surprises.
('8', 77, 1, 14, 182240) The gentleman admits that he had not imagined in March last that the Indian community would offer such determined resistance as it has done.
('8', 77, 1, 15, 182381) He still believes that the community has been misled by a handful of leaders.
('8', 77, 1, 16, 182459) The leaders are of course prepared for imprisonment.
('8', 77, 1, 17, 182512) But will the Indian commu nity be unmanned?
('8', 77, 1, 18, 182556) If Indians do not give way to fear, that is, if they show courage, he who runs may read 2 that there is nothing General Smuts can do.
('8', 77, 1, 19, 182690) He himself adds that the remedy lies in the hands of the Indians.
('8', 77, 1, 20, 182756) That is indeed truewith this difference: according to Mr. Smuts, the remedy lies in our accepting the bonds of our slavery forthwith, whereas in our view the Indians can don the fragrant gar land strung together with freedom, honour, good name, independence and fear of Khuda Ishwar.
('8', 77, 1, 21, 183040) Lakshmi is at our doorstep ready to mark our foreheads with the sign of her grace.
('8', 77, 1, 22, 183123) 3 How can Indians avert their faces?
('8', 77, 1, 23, 183160) This is the point.
('8', 77, 1, 24, 183179) No one should even dream of registration, or fight shy of trading without licences.
('8', 77, 1, 25, 183263) If, in consequence, we are imprisoned, that should be welcome; even deportation should be welcome.
('8', 77, 1, 26, 183362) If we take up this attitude, we need fear neither of the two evils.
('8', 77, 1, 27, 183430) In any case, it is better to face out one of these than be haunted by the spectre of registration.

('8', 78, 2, 3, 183928) [Before January 10, 1908] We hear many things said about the honour once accorded to Ram Sundar.
('8', 78, 2, 4, 184025) We have even received some letters on the subject.
('8', 78, 2, 5, 184076) Some people say that he was an indentured labourer, others that he has cheated a number of people.
('8', 78, 2, 6, 184175) There are those who argue that, because such respect was lavished on a person like him, the Indian community is unlikely to listen to any of its leaders again.
('8', 78, 2, 7, 184335) It was, they argue, a great mistake to have closed their shops for a man of his type, and no one should now expect shops to be closed for any Indian, whoever he may be.
('8', 78, 2, 8, 184504) There are yet others who have been eagerly waiting for an opportunity to drive a wedge between Hindus and Muslims.
('8', 78, 2, 9, 184619) We think all these people are in the wrong.
('8', 78, 2, 10, 184663) If Ram Sundar was an indentured labourer and if, knowing this, the Indian community had eulogized him for his genuine courage, that would have been all the more credi table.
('8', 78, 2, 11, 184837) Poverty is nothing to be ashamed of, nor is indenture.
('8', 78, 2, 12, 184892) Indians ought especially to be proud of an indentured labourer who shows great courage.
('8', 78, 2, 13, 184980) For that may lead to better placed persons coming forward to display greater courage.
('8', 78, 2, 14, 185066) In any case, the community had no information about Ram Sundar having been an indentured labou rer or about his debts.
('8', 78, 2, 15, 185185) At that time the community gave no thought to the matter.
('8', 78, 2, 16, 185243) The work that he did and the speeches that he made invited praise.
('8', 78, 2, 17, 185310) It was not Ram Sundar who was honoured in royal fashion, but the person who suffered a months imprisonment.
('8', 78, 2, 18, 185418) The shops were closed not for the sake of Ram Sundar, but tangibly to show that we were grieved at the wrongful imprisonment of an Indian and to bring home to the others the fact of our unity.
('8', 78, 2, 19, 185611) The Indian community has already reaped the benefits of the closing of shops and of the hom age [done to Ram Sundar].
('8', 78, 2, 20, 185729) What Ram Sundar gained, he has thrown away.
('8', 78, 2, 21, 185773) The honour that we accorded was not to an individual, but to the qualities of truth and courage which we attributed to him.
('8', 78, 2, 22, 185897) What happened in Ram Sundars case was only fit and proper.
('8', 78, 2, 23, 185956) Now that we have seen through his duplicity, we pour scorn on him.
('8', 78, 2, 24, 186023) That again is natural.
('8', 78, 2, 25, 186046) Such has always been the way of the world.
('8', 78, 2, 26, 186089) Mr. Arbuthnot 2 of Madras was held in esteem both by the Government and people so

('8', 79, 1, 3, 186584) On being exposed as a fraud, he had to face prosecution and imprisonment.
('8', 79, 1, 4, 186658) If people are to think well of us, we must always distinguish between truth and falsehood in every matter.
('8', 79, 1, 5, 186765) If we do so, we shall carry our point every time.
('8', 79, 1, 6, 186815) We do not want to say anything further on the question of Hindu Muslim differ ences that has been raised in this context.
('8', 79, 1, 7, 186937) There is not the slightest doubt, however, that the question has been raised through sheer want of sense.
('8', 79, 1, 8, 187043) It altogether passes our understanding why people should talk of Hindu Muslim differences over questions of common interest which do not involve any religious issues.

('8', 79, 4, 12, 187304) PASSIVE RESISTANCE The editor had invited [suggestions from readers for] a Gujarati equivalent for passive resistance.
('8', 79, 4, 13, 187423) 2 I have received one which is not bad, though it does not render the original in its full connotation.
('8', 79, 4, 14, 187527) I shall, however, use it for the present.
('8', 79, 4, 15, 187569) The word is sadagraha.
('8', 79, 4, 16, 187592) I think satyagraha is better than sadagraha.
('8', 79, 4, 17, 187637) Resistance means determined opposition to anything.
('8', 79, 4, 18, 187689) The correspondent has rendered it as agraha 3. Agraha in a right cause is sat or satya 4 agraha.
('8', 79, 4, 19, 187786) The correspondent therefore has rendered passive resistance as firmness in a good cause.
('8', 79, 4, 20, 187875) Though the phrase does not exhaust the connotation of the word passive, we shall use satyagraha till a word is available which deserves the prize.
('8', 79, 4, 21, 188022) Satyagraha, then, is at high tide at present.

('8', 80, 1, 3, 188884) They all assert that, if the Government does not reach a settlement, it will do injury to the British Empire and rouse Indians.
('8', 80, 1, 4, 189012) The word rouse may startle Indians.
('8', 80, 1, 5, 189048) That India will be roused is, however, beyond any doubtif the [Transvaal] Indian community can bear the final burden.

('8', 80, 3, 16, 190011) Such is the miraculous power of satya agraha.
('8', 80, 3, 17, 190057) As I write this, I seem to hear it whispered in my ear that God is always the friend and protector of truth.
('8', 80, 3, 18, 190166) Our success in bringing this campaign to this stage is a triumph for truth.
('8', 80, 3, 19, 190242) If we were to fail now, that would in no way detract from the power of truth.
('8', 80, 3, 20, 190320) It is only because of our untruth, insincerity and disunity that we may lose, if at all.
('8', 80, 3, 21, 190409) The present indications, however, do not point to defeat.
('8', 80, 3, 22, 190467) The Indian community is displaying fine strength.
('8', 80, 3, 23, 190517) Meetings are being held one after another.
('8', 80, 3, 24, 190560) Hundreds of people, who attend them, go on reiterating that they will face impri sonment and deportation, but will not submit to the Act.
('8', 80, 3, 25, 190698) I cannot believe that all these men are just acting a part as Ram Sundar was.
('8', 80, 4, 26, 190776) HUGE MASS MEETING
('8', 80, 5, 27, 190794) The huge mass meeting which took place on the 1st was attended by at least 2,500 persons.
('8', 80, 5, 28, 190884) They were all full of enthusiasm.
('8', 80, 5, 29, 190918) The editor will publish a full report of the meeting elsewhere.
('8', 80, 5, 30, 190982) I shall only mention that Mr. David Pollock 1 (not to be mistaken for our editor), the assistant editor of Rand Daily Mail, their cartoonist and a few other Europeans who were present at the meeting went there
('8', 80, 6, 31, 191192) 1 Reporter of London Daily Telegraph and a J.P. of the Transvaal; an active sympathizer of the Indian cause, sometime Secretary for Lands in the Transvaal, Honorary Secretary, Native Affairs Society, Transvaal

('8', 81, 1, 2, 191443) especially to watch the proceedings.
('8', 81, 1, 3, 191480) There were also many Indians from outside [the Transvaal].
('8', 81, 2, 4, 191539) MISS SCHLESINS SPEECH
('8', 81, 3, 5, 191561) Miss Schlesin 1 is an unmarried girl of twenty.
('8', 81, 3, 6, 191609) Very few Indians know how hard she has worked for the community.
('8', 81, 3, 7, 191674) She works indeed not for a salary, but because of her deep sympathy [for the Indian cause].
('8', 81, 3, 8, 191766) She attends cheerfully to everything that is entrusted to her.
('8', 81, 3, 9, 191829) She asked to speak at the recent mass meeting.
('8', 81, 3, 10, 191876) What follows is a translation of her thoughts.
('8', 81, 3, 11, 191923) She had obtained her parents permission for making a speech.
('8', 81, 3, 12, 191984) This girl has passed her matriculation examination, and she can be said to have had an excellent education.
('8', 81, 3, 13, 192092) Her speech was read out by Mr. Gandhi: 2
('8', 81, 4, 14, 192133) Now that the struggle has reached its culminating point, I, who have followed it with the closest attention almost from its inception, would fain say a few words of sympathy, of heartfelt sympathy, in the sufferings which you have already undergone, in the sufferings still before you, of which the former are but aforetaste.
('8', 81, 4, 15, 192459) But I implore you not to flinch from the hardships which now confront you, not to falter at the shoals ahead, but to continue steadfastin your heroic resolve to give up all, aye very life itself, for the noble cause of country and religion.
('8', 81, 4, 16, 192700) Let me remind you of a similar crusade now being waged by my sisters in England.
('8', 81, 4, 17, 192781) I refer to the suffragettes.
('8', 81, 4, 18, 192810) For the sake of a principle, they are prepared to lose their all, to brave innumerable trials.
('8', 81, 4, 19, 192905) Many have already suffered imprisonment, more are ready, nay eager, to do so.
('8', 81, 4, 20, 192983) If delicately nurtured women can do this, will hardy men, inured to toil, do less?
('8', 81, 4, 21, 193066) Do not swerve from the course upon which you have entered, be true to the ideal before you; and heart within and God oerhead, proceed to conquer or to die.
('8', 81, 4, 22, 193222) And, if you do that, if you adhere to your solemn covenant with God, if you prove yourselves resolute in deed, as you have already shown yourselves gentle in method, then it will not be to die!
('8', 81, 4, 23, 193416) Success then is assured, victory is yours, is ours.
('8', 81, 4, 24, 193468) It is a young girl who addresses this sincere exhortation to us.
('8', 81, 4, 25, 193533) If, after all this, we accept loss of face out of a cowardly fear of gaol, we are sure to repent it much.
('8', 81, 5, 26, 193639) 1 Sonja Schlesin; a Jewish girl with a character as clear as crystal and courage that would shame a warrior; joined Gandhiji as a steno typist at the age of 16; made herself very useful to Indian Opinion; was ardently interested in the Indian cause.
('8', 81, 5, 27, 193889) Thousands of stalwart Indians looked up to her for guidance.
('8', 81, 5, 28, 193950) When during the satyagraha days almost everyone was in jail, she led the movement single handed.
('8', 81, 5, 29, 194047) She had the management of thousands, a tremendous amount of correspondence, and Indian Opinion on her hands, but she never wearied. Vide also Satyagraha in South Africa, Ch. XXIII, and Autobiography, Part IV, Ch. XII.
('8', 81, 5, 30, 194265) 2 What follows here is the English version of Miss Schlesins speech taken from Indian Opinion, 11 1 1908.
('8', 82, 0, 1, 194371) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 83
('8', 82, 1, 2, 194415) DEPORTATION IMPOSSIBLE
('8', 82, 2, 3, 194438) The Immigrants Act provided good fun for a day.
('8', 82, 2, 4, 194486) It is being admitted on all hands that no one can be deported.
('8', 82, 2, 5, 194549) This is not only Mr. Leonards 1 opinion; a correspondent writing specially for [Rand] Daily Mail has advanced several arguments to show that deportation of Indians would be unlawful.
('8', 82, 2, 6, 194732) If that is so, the Royal assent given to the Immigrants Act only shows that the Imperial Government is reluctant to throw in its weight on our side.
('8', 82, 2, 7, 194881) But was there any reason to expect anything else?
('8', 82, 2, 8, 194931) For some of us write anonymous letters to the Registrar to inform him that they are prepared to register but that they hold back only for fear of public opinion, and request the Registrar to note their names.
('8', 82, 2, 9, 195140) It is again our own people who write to the Registrar to defame Ram Sundar.
('8', 82, 2, 10, 195216) However unworthy Ram Sundar may be, writing anonymous letters to run him down demeans us in the eyes of others.
('8', 82, 2, 11, 195328) We show ourselves to be cowards.
('8', 82, 2, 12, 195361) These anonymous letters damage our cause by undoing the good impression that our courage has created.
('8', 82, 2, 13, 195463) For these letters would be confidentially forwarded to Lord Elgin.
('8', 82, 2, 14, 195530) He would take them into his reckoning; and why indeed should he not?
('8', 82, 2, 15, 195599) Mixed with a grain of truth that such letters may contain, there must be a great proportion of falsehood which will gain wider currency.
('8', 82, 2, 16, 195736) As a result we are bound to be treated as bad cowrie.
('8', 82, 2, 17, 195790) When we gain acceptance as good cowrie, when our bones softened by long years of slavery grow strong again, when we desist from dark, furtive dealings, we shall certainly get our due from the Imperial Government, however imperial it may be.
('8', 82, 2, 18, 196031) When we ourselves lack courage, how can we blame the Imperial Government?
('8', 82, 3, 19, 196105) COWARDLY STUFF
('8', 82, 4, 20, 196120) As soon as the Immigration Bill was signed, people at Pieter sburg sent telegrams to say that they were leaving at once to report at the registration office.
('8', 82, 4, 21, 196278) And these doughty persons arrived in Pretoria forthwith.
('8', 82, 4, 22, 196335) Then they paid court to His Lordship Cha mney.
('8', 82, 4, 23, 196382) He said he was unable to grant them the title deed of their slavery, and wanted them to produce an order from a magistrate.
('8', 82, 4, 24, 196506) They then approached the Magistrate at Pretoria, who told them that he had no authority to act in the matter.
('8', 82, 4, 25, 196616) Now (before Sunday), the right royal procession has returned to Pietersburg.
('8', 82, 4, 26, 196693) When they receive an order from the Magistrate there, they will again troop off to Pretoria.
('8', 82, 4, 27, 196786) I know the names of these brave ones.
('8', 82, 4, 28, 196824) I am not sure whether the foregoing account is correct or whether slavery has not already been conferred on them.
('8', 82, 4, 29, 196938) I am only reporting what I have been told.
('8', 82, 5, 30, 196981) 1 A well known Johannesburg barrister
('8', 83, 0, 1, 197019) 84 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 83, 1, 2, 197060) APPEAL TO THE BRAVE
('8', 83, 2, 3, 197080) I hear that even the few brave Memons at Pietersburg who have, along with the Suratis and Hindus of that town, shown great determination so far, are beginning to lose heart; they have caught the infection from the black faced ones and are trembling with fear.
('8', 83, 2, 4, 197340) If this is so, they have my fullest sympathy.
('8', 83, 2, 5, 197386) Where cowards are in a majority, even the assurance of the courageous is likely to be shaken.
('8', 83, 2, 6, 197480) However, I appeal to them all, and especially to the Memons, not to allow the ship to go down just when we are about to sight land.
('8', 83, 2, 7, 197612) If all the Memons become deserters, that will be a blot on Porbandar, Bhanvad and Ranavav.
('8', 83, 2, 8, 197703) We may be able to ignore the cowards, or succeed, later, in infusing courage into them.
('8', 83, 2, 9, 197791) But the entire community would go down in dishonour if there was not even one Memon who remained truthful.
('8', 83, 2, 10, 197898) If even one of them survives, he will save the others.
('8', 83, 2, 11, 197953) Let me therefore earnestly appeal to Mr. Abdool Latief and others who have really held out.
('8', 83, 2, 12, 198045) To Suratis and Hindus I say only: Please, in the name of God, do not let yourselves drown.
('8', 83, 2, 13, 198136) If only you will show a little courage, the fight is easy enough.
('8', 83, 2, 14, 198202) You should not lose heart because so many persons from Pietersburg have deserted.
('8', 83, 2, 15, 198284) Indians all over the Transvaal are courageously holding out.
('8', 83, 2, 16, 198345) And those in Pietersburg who remain unyielding till the last will deserve to be complimented for genuine courage.
('8', 83, 2, 17, 198459) For there is more at stake there. TRAITORS IN DELAGOA BAY A letter has been addressed to the Registrar concerning two treacherous and self seeking Indians at Delagoa Bay.
('8', 83, 2, 18, 198630) The Registrar has asked for their names; these, however, cannot be supplied.
('8', 83, 2, 19, 198707) For I have been informed that one of them has been arrested and the other has disappeared.
('8', 83, 2, 20, 198798) There was a white person with them who posed as Registrar.
('8', 83, 2, 21, 198857) When shall we be rid of such enemies of Indians?
('8', 83, 2, 22, 198906) It appears that some persons cannot End other means of making money.
('8', 83, 2, 23, 198975) If that is what it is, the only thing to do is for us to keep our distance from such evil men.
('8', 83, 2, 24, 199070) I hope that at Delagoa Bay and elsewhere Indians will warn everyone [against such persons].
('8', 83, 2, 25, 199162) In this big battle we must not tolerate falsehood anywhere.
('8', 83, 2, 26, 199222) We must try to improve ourselves.
('8', 83, 2, 27, 199256) We ought not merely to act a part, as Ram Sundar did.
('8', 83, 2, 28, 199310) SYMPATHY FROM WHITES The struggle has assumed impressive proportions and has evoked expressions of sympathy from many whites.
('8', 83, 2, 29, 199436) The meeting 1
('8', 83, 3, 30, 199450) 1 Held on December 28, 1907;vide Speech in Government Square, 28 12 1907
('8', 84, 0, 1, 199523) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 85
('8', 84, 1, 2, 199567) held in front of the Court and the one in front of Mr. Gandhis office were both attended by nearly a hundred whites.
('8', 84, 1, 3, 199684) Apparently all of them sympathized with the Indian cause.
('8', 84, 1, 4, 199742) Mr. Hosken 1, who earlier used to advise us to accept the title deed of slavery, has now begun to offer us encouragement.
('8', 84, 1, 5, 199864) Such is the fruit of truth and courage.
('8', 84, 2, 6, 199904) TRADE LICENCES
('8', 84, 3, 7, 199919) Since store keepers and hawkers are to carry on trade without licences and risk imprisonment, Mr. Essop Mia has addressed a letter 2 to the Receiver [of Revenues] to inform him that the Indian commu nity will rather carry on business without licences than take out regis ters.
('8', 84, 3, 8, 200196) They will willingly face all incidental risks.
('8', 84, 3, 9, 200243) Indians, he has said, will, however, be prepared to pay the licence fee if the Government is disposed to accept it.
('8', 84, 3, 10, 200359) The Receiver has said in reply that under the Asiatic [Regist ration] Act licences cannot be issued to Indians without registers, and that those who carry on trade without licences will incur penalties under the Revenue Licence Ordinance.
('8', 84, 3, 11, 200598) No Indian is likely to be frightened now by the words incur penalties.
('8', 84, 3, 12, 200669) The store keepers and hawkers are prepared to carry on their business at the risk of such penalties.
('8', 84, 3, 13, 200770) The Association has addressed in all 72 letters to various persons in different towns suggesting that they should carry on trade without licences.
('8', 84, 3, 14, 200917) It no longer makes any difference [to the traders].
('8', 84, 3, 15, 200969) The courage shown by Indians, however, does make a difference.
('8', 84, 3, 16, 201032) Business must go on meanwhile; and in the event of prosecution for unlicensed trade, one should submit to imprisonment rather than pay the fine.
('8', 84, 3, 17, 201177) The assistants who stay behind will be free to run the shops.
('8', 84, 3, 18, 201239) They cannot be prosecuted, and the Government has no authority forcibly to close down businesses.
('8', 84, 4, 19, 201337) HINDUS AND MUSLIMS
('8', 84, 5, 20, 201356) I find occasional references made to the Hindu Muslim question in connection with Ram Sundars case.
('8', 84, 5, 21, 201456) 3 And now there are telegrams
('8', 84, 6, 22, 201486) 1 William Hosken; rich and prominent member of Transvaal Legislative Assembly; chairman of Committee of European Sympathizers which mediated between the satyagrahis and the Government in the 1908 campaign; had subsequently to give up his political career because of his negrophile tendencies.
('8', 84, 6, 23, 201779) Vide Satyagraha in South Africa, Ch. XIII and XVI, and Mr. Hoskens Inevitable, 10 8 1907 .
('8', 84, 6, 24, 201870) 2 Vide Letter to Receiver of Revenues, p.
('8', 84, 6, 25, 201912) 6; and for his reply, vide 2nd footnote of Letter to Receiver of Revenues, 4 1 1908 .
('8', 84, 6, 26, 201998) 3 Vide also Ram Sundar, Before 10 1 1908
('8', 85, 0, 1, 202039) 86 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 85, 1, 2, 202080) from Natal reporting that a pointed reference has been made to it in the Mercury.
('8', 85, 1, 3, 202162) Mr. Dawad Mahomed 1 and Mr. Peeran Mahomed have issued an effective rejoinder which more than meets the point.
('8', 85, 1, 4, 202273) However, I must say that the person responsible for the report in the Mercury is an enemy of the community.
('8', 85, 1, 5, 202381) At a time when the Indian community is engaged in a gigantic task, anyone suggesting that differences exist between Hindus and Muslims is lying to serve his own ends.
('8', 85, 1, 6, 202548) I would advise people to shun these traitors to community and country like poison It is obvious that neither of the communities stands to gain anything from an insistence on differences.
('8', 85, 1, 7, 202735) CARTOON IN THE SUNDAY TIMES Though the editor of The Sunday Times writes against Indians, their cartoonist is doing a great service to the cause.
('8', 85, 1, 8, 202881) He has portrayed the Indian community as an elephant, with its feet firmly planted on the ground.
('8', 85, 1, 9, 202979) Mr. Smuts is forcing him forward with a steam roller from the rear.
('8', 85, 1, 10, 203047) The elephant remarks: Stop your tickling, Jan! The point of the cartoon is that the steam roller has been unable to budge the elephant.
('8', 85, 1, 11, 203183) In the event, the cartoon has only served to publicize our cause widely and has occasioned some merriment at General Smuts expense.
('8', 85, 1, 12, 203315) CARTOON IN RAND DAILY MAIL Daily Mail presents Mr. Gandhi in the guise of a martyr of olden times.
('8', 85, 1, 13, 203414) He is tied to a stake, surrounded by stacks of hay.
('8', 85, 1, 14, 203466) There are three drums full of oil above, labelled The Permit Act, The Asiatic Registration Act and The Immigration Act.
('8', 85, 1, 15, 203586) Oil is drip ping from all the three drums on to the stacks of hay.
('8', 85, 1, 16, 203653) Mr. Smuts is holding a lighted torch.
('8', 85, 1, 17, 203691) [Protruding] from underneath his dress can be seen the point of his scabbard with a sword in it.
('8', 85, 1, 18, 203788) St. Gandhi is saying, You certainly look fierce.
('8', 85, 1, 19, 203837) And you are taking very long.
('8', 85, 1, 20, 203867) Why dont you apply the torch?
('8', 85, 1, 21, 203897) Be quick and have done with it. But General Smuts is standing with his back turned, afraid to light the fire.
('8', 85, 1, 22, 204007) POTCHEFSTROOM INDIANS The Potchefstroom Indians were accused of having lost their nerve.
('8', 85, 1, 23, 204096) They have replied to this through The Star asserting that they all remain firm and that only a few Memons have disgraced them selves.
('8', 85, 1, 24, 204230) Mr. Abdool Rehman, the Secretary, has also been accused of
('8', 85, 2, 25, 204289) 1 Chairman, Natal Indian Congress.
('8', 85, 2, 26, 204324) An old Transvaal resident, he crossed over into the Colony in July 1908 and refused to give his thumb impression at the border under Act 2 of 1907. He thus courted arrest to establish the right of entry of old Transvaal Indian residents which Smuts was later to question.
('8', 86, 0, 1, 204596) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 87
('8', 86, 1, 2, 204640) having registered himself.
('8', 86, 1, 3, 204667) He has written a letter to deny this, offering to pay 50 to charities if anyone can prove the allegation.
('8', 86, 2, 4, 204773) MEETING ON SUNDAY
('8', 86, 3, 5, 204791) Another meeting was held in front of the Mosque last Sunday.
('8', 86, 3, 6, 204852) Many speeches were made and it was resolved that store keepers and hawkers should carry on trade without licences.
('8', 86, 3, 7, 204967) There is much enthu siasm in evidence at the moment.
('8', 86, 4, 8, 205020) COMMENTS IN THE [TRANSVAAL] LEADER
('8', 86, 5, 9, 205055) Commenting on General Smuts speech, The Transvaal Leader writes as follows: 1
('8', 86, 6, 10, 205133) General Smuts latest speech appears more statesmanlike than his previous utterances.
('8', 86, 6, 11, 205218) He has hinted at the reasons for the change in his attitude.
('8', 86, 6, 12, 205279) It would have been better if he had stated at the same time whether he desired the Opposition to join him in achieving the end that he had in view.
('8', 86, 6, 13, 205427) If the Government wishes them to give an assurance that they are not opposed to the modification, it is for the Government to say so.
('8', 86, 6, 14, 205561) It is not easy to understand how it is that officials can state that 5,000 Asiatics have crossed the border and yet are unable to check the Asiatic influx along that border.
('8', 86, 6, 15, 205735) Mr. Smuts dismisses the plan of sending [everyone] to gaol as a waste of effort.
('8', 86, 6, 16, 205816) It cannot be argued that the continued stay of the Asiatics in the Transvaal will put the Government to as much expense as the adoption of this course would.
('8', 86, 6, 17, 205974) Even if the Government has the necessary authority, deporting [Indians] does not appear to be a practicable course.
('8', 86, 6, 18, 206090) The Colonial Secretary has therefore decided to deal vigorously with the leaders, certain that this will end the trouble.
('8', 86, 6, 19, 206212) The argument that a whole community is held by two or three men in the hollow of their hand is one that we distrust, but time and events will prove whether it is applicable.
('8', 86, 6, 20, 206386) The action of theChinese in declining to register, despite disapproval by the Chinese Consul, does not bear out General Smuts contention.
('8', 86, 6, 21, 206524) General Smuts seems to fear the effect upon the Kaffirs of the success of a campaign of passive resistance.
('8', 86, 6, 22, 206632) But how is it that laws were modified before?
('8', 86, 6, 23, 206678) And, after all, is it not something to the good that Kaffirs should feel that, in any differences with the white race, there are milder arguments than the rifle and assegai?

('8', 87, 4, 7, 207121) The Maulvi Saheb was informed by the Registrar that his permit would be extended provided he gave his word that he would leave on the expiry of the extended time limit.
('8', 87, 4, 8, 207290) He has pointed out in reply that the Registrar had promised to extend the permits every six months, once in the presence of Mr. Hajee Habib and again in the presence of Mr. Nagadi and Mr. Munga.
('8', 87, 4, 9, 207485) It was on the strength of this promise that he had started the work in connection with the Madrasah while con tinuing his duties at the Mosque and his work for the Hamidia Soci ety.
('8', 87, 4, 10, 207667) He also has, he says, to tell the people about the religious aspect of the law.

('8', 87, 8, 16, 208010) A resolution expressing sympathy for the Indians was passed at a conference of the African Political Organization.

('8', 87, 10, 20, 208267) [JOHANNESBURG, January 10, 1908]
('8', 87, 11, 21, 208300) Mr. Gandhi insisted upon the elimination of the element of compulsion of the Act and the consequent withdrawal of the notices regarding the issue of licences and registration.
('8', 87, 11, 22, 208476) In return he undertook that every Indian in the country would be registered in a months time according to a form to be mutually agreed upon which would be issued to those Indians entitled to remain in the Colony or who were otherwise approved.
('8', 87, 12, 23, 208720) 1 The names are not reproduced here and the figures in square brackets indicate the number of persons from each town.

('8', 88, 1, 2, 208882) If voluntary registration were faithfully carried out, the Registration Act would become useless, and the Indian community would look for its withdrawal during the next session of Parliament.
('8', 88, 1, 3, 209074) If on the other hand the undertaking of the leaders were not fulfilled, Mr. Gandhi said he would welcome the enforcement of the Act against those who had not complied.
('8', 88, 2, 4, 209242) He was prepared to go further, evidently with the view of meeting the prejudice against the Indian trader, and was anxious that the Government and the various municipalities should frame by laws governing the issue of trading licences, so that only Indians with suitable premises and with the means of keeping a proper system of accounts should be licensed to trade.

('8', 88, 4, 7, 209677) [JOHANNESBURG, January 10, 1908]
('8', 88, 5, 8, 209710) TO TRANSVAAL INDIANS
('8', 88, 6, 9, 209731) It must be borne in mind that success in the struggle will depend on what the Transvaal Indians do while those arrested remain in gaol.
('8', 88, 6, 10, 209867) It is well therefore that the Government has arrested some persons.
('8', 88, 6, 11, 209935) It will be a testing time for the others.
('8', 88, 6, 12, 209977) Cowards will spread panic.
('8', 88, 6, 13, 210004) Blacklegs will say all manner of things.
('8', 88, 6, 14, 210045) It is my appeal to all my brave fellow countrymen to remain undaunted by these, and be ever mindful of their pledge and keep up their courage.
('8', 88, 6, 15, 210188) At the very beginning of the campaign we had resolved not to compromise our honour by submitting to the obnoxious law, whateverthe cost.
('8', 88, 6, 16, 210325) We find hundreds of examples, among the British, of persons sacrificing their all for honour and country.
('8', 88, 6, 17, 210431) It is only when we do likewise that we shall become esteemed men and retain that esteem.
('8', 88, 6, 18, 210520) I therefore take it that Indians will remain unshaken, whether or not they get licences, whether or not they are allowed credit, and that they will only become confirmed in their resolve to endure imprisonment or deportation.
('8', 88, 6, 19, 210746) If only they will prepare themselves in their own minds, they will find that gaol is not something to be frightened of.
('8', 88, 6, 20, 210866) Let no one look to the others; let each depend on his own strength, so that even if in fear a few Indians submit to the outrageous law, the others will not be tempted to do likewise.
('8', 88, 6, 21, 211049) You will, in this manner, serve your interests as well as those of the country.
('8', 88, 6, 22, 211129) If you make the mistake of registering, you will throw
('8', 89, 0, 1, 211184) 90 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 89, 1, 2, 211225) away success just as it has come within reach.
('8', 89, 1, 3, 211272) Not only does this righteous campaign call for courage; but it is also based on truth.
('8', 89, 1, 4, 211359) Large numbers [of Indians] must be faced with the prospect of starvation.
('8', 89, 1, 5, 211433) It will be necessary to provide for their relief.
('8', 89, 1, 6, 211483) This will call for honesty of the highest degree.
('8', 89, 1, 7, 211533) Contributions will be received from various towns, and these will have to be utilized to good purpose.
('8', 89, 1, 8, 211636) Let no one ask for aid unless in need.
('8', 89, 1, 9, 211675) Those in charge of distributing aid should act with the utmost scrupulousness in utilizing whatever funds or food grains are placed at their disposal.
('8', 89, 1, 10, 211826) This struggle will test the strength of all the elements of character and lay bare all our weaknesses.
('8', 89, 1, 11, 211929) Let us be careful, then, after sending so many people to gaol not to throw away this opportunity by panicking and submitting to the law.
('8', 89, 1, 12, 212066) We should bear no grudge against those who have taken out registers or may do so hereafter.
('8', 89, 1, 13, 212158) If you are convinced that their action is not right, you will not feel the slightest temptation to follow their example.
('8', 89, 1, 14, 212279) Those who have the courage to fight till the last will be able to earn a livelihood anywhere in the world.
('8', 89, 2, 15, 212386) TO OTHER INDIANS IN SOUTH AFRICA
('8', 89, 3, 16, 212419) The Transvaal Indians put up with hardships of every descriptionphysical, mental, financial.
('8', 89, 3, 17, 212512) You are asked to make sacrifices only of money.
('8', 89, 3, 18, 212560) Do not therefore fall behind.
('8', 89, 3, 19, 212590) Money will be needed in plenty.
('8', 89, 3, 20, 212622) Your congratulations are welcome; they are of some use.
('8', 89, 3, 21, 212678) But they will have meaning only if you follow them up with financial aid.
('8', 89, 3, 22, 212752) This is a campaign that concerns not only the Transvaal Indians, but the entire Indian community.
('8', 89, 3, 23, 212850) Your interests, too, are atstake.
('8', 89, 3, 24, 212884) It is in your power to give financial aid; equally, you can help by holding meetings and passing resolutions.
('8', 89, 4, 25, 212994) TO ALL INDIANS
('8', 89, 5, 26, 213009) Success will never be ours if we do not at all costs keep Hindu Muslim differences out of matters of common interest.
('8', 89, 5, 27, 213127) Let everyone accept this as a guiding principle.
('8', 89, 5, 28, 213176) We shall succeed only when we feel a strong urge that all of us, Hindus and Muslims alike, belong to the Same land and are children of the same mother.

('8', 90, 0, 1, 213397) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 91
('8', 90, 1, 2, 213441) 50. SPEECH AT NEWTOWN MOSQUE 1
('8', 90, 2, 3, 213472) [JOHANNESBURG January 10,1908]
('8', 90, 3, 4, 213503) There was considerable commotion among the Indian community this morning, says The Star (Johannesburg) of Saturday last, when it became known that Mr. Gandhi and the other Indians and Chinese who were ordered to leave the Colony within 48 hours a fortnight ago were called upon to attend Court for sentence.
('8', 90, 3, 5, 213811) There was a large gathering outside B Court at ten oclock, and before the doors were opened word was circulated that the proceedings against the defaulters would not be taken until the afternoon.
('8', 90, 3, 6, 214007) Mr. Gandhi availed himself of the opportunity the few hours postponement allowed to address his countrymen.
('8', 90, 3, 7, 214115) It was to be a valedictory exhor tation to the rank and file of the Indians to stand firm during the incarceration of the leaders of the passive resisters movement.
('8', 90, 3, 8, 214280) The meeting was held in the Mosque grounds, Newtown, at 11 oclock, and despite the short notice of the meeting there was a large gathering.
('8', 90, 3, 9, 214420) For the purpose of such [a] meeting a platform had been erected in the grounds, and seating accommodation was provided by means of the serviceable paraffin tins which were strewn about in thousands.
('8', 90, 3, 10, 214619) On the platform were Essop Ismail Mia, Chairman of the British Indian Association, an Indian priest in an artistic Oriental garb, and Mr. Gandhi.
('8', 90, 3, 11, 214765) A few introductory remarks were made by Mr. Mia, and then Mr. Gandhi spoke.
('8', 90, 3, 12, 214841) He was listened to with the greatest intentness.
('8', 90, 3, 13, 214890) Every eye was fixed upon the slim central figure of Mr. Gandhi, and the meeting gave an indication of the hold he has upon his countrymen.
('8', 90, 4, 14, 215029) After his speech 2 in Hindustani Mr. Gandhi spoke in English.
('8', 90, 4, 15, 215091) He said he could not detain them for any length of time.
('8', 90, 4, 16, 215148) The telephone message he had received that morning was that those who were under notice and whose period of notice had expired had to appear before the Court at 10 oclock.
('8', 90, 4, 17, 215320) Just as they were about to leave for the Court, Superintendent Vernon came to inform them that they were to appear at two oclock.
('8', 90, 4, 18, 215450) He believed that those who had to go to gaol today were not at all afraid.
('8', 90, 4, 19, 215525) On the contrary, they considered that it was a fit opportunity given them by the Government to serve their country and to show that they weremen, not dogs.
('8', 90, 4, 20, 215681) All the same, he was superstitious enough to believe that when these things were postponed from time to time, even though they might ultimately happen, they showed which way the wind was blowing, and they showed also that God was with them.
('8', 90, 5, 21, 215922) FREE HOSPITALITY
('8', 90, 6, 22, 215939) He thought he would not have had that opportunity of addressing his countrymen before accepting the free hospitality of His Majesty.
('8', 90, 6, 23, 216072) But God had willed
('8', 90, 7, 24, 216091) 1 This is the Star report as reproduced in Indian Opinion under the title Mr. Gandhis Valediction: Leaders Imprisoned.
('8', 90, 7, 25, 216210) 2 This is not available.
('8', 91, 0, 1, 216235) 92 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 91, 1, 2, 216276) otherwise, and he was there to give them the last word probably for a month, it might be for two months, it might be for six months, and the word he had to place before them was Do not deceive yourselves; do not deceive the Government; do not deceive your humble servant. He believed sincerely that that struggle had been undertaken at their desire; that when he placed before them the true position of the law, all of them said that it was not possible for them to submit to the lawthat rather than submit to a law of that nature they would suffer imprisonment, be banished from the country, lose everything that they possessed, rather than submit to the law.
('8', 91, 2, 3, 216937) THE STING OF THE ACT
('8', 91, 3, 4, 216958) That law, he repeated for the thousandth time, was not a question of giving a wifes name or a mothers name, or giving one thumb impression or ten digit impressions, although all those things were undoubtedly to be considered when they were compelled to give these things, but the sting lay in the spirit itself.
('8', 91, 3, 5, 217270) Jesus Christ had said that no man had seen God because He was a spirit.
('8', 91, 3, 6, 217342) Similarly it was not possible to describe in words the underlying spirit of the Act.
('8', 91, 3, 7, 217427) Every Indian felt that spirit, and having felt it shunned it as he would shun Satan.
('8', 91, 3, 8, 217512) The law was based upon the condemnation of the whole of the Indian community, and it did not matter a bit whether General Smuts said that he wished to treat them justly and fairly.
('8', 91, 3, 9, 217693) Judgment should be pronounced upon his acts and not upon his words.
('8', 91, 3, 10, 217761) What they saw was that by reason of false dignity the Government would not have what they wanted to give freely, but wanted to compel them to give as if they were slaves.
('8', 91, 3, 11, 217932) Compulsion was possible in a matter of personal freedom only when it was slaves who were to be dealt with.
('8', 91, 4, 12, 218039) THE DOG S COLLAR
('8', 91, 5, 13, 218056) He well recalled an incident that happened when with Mr. Ally he went to England as their servant.
('8', 91, 5, 14, 218155) A gentleman on board said, I see you are going to London in order to get rid of the dogs collar. Precisely; it was because they did not want to wear a dogs collar that they had put up that fight.
('8', 91, 5, 15, 218351) They were willing to sacrifice everything for sentiment, but it was a noble sentiment.
('8', 91, 5, 16, 218438) It was a sentiment that had to be cherished as a religious sentiment.
('8', 91, 5, 17, 218508) It was a sentiment that bound people together; it was a sentiment that bound creatures to the Creator.
('8', 91, 5, 18, 218611) That was the sentiment for which he had asked them, advised them, if necessary, to die.
('8', 91, 5, 19, 218699) Their action would be reflected throughout the British dominions, through the length and breadth of India, and they were now upon their trial.
('8', 91, 6, 20, 218842) GENERAL SMUTS ACTION
('8', 91, 7, 21, 218863) He did consider General Smuts had performed an honourable action in arresting them and wishing to lodge them in gaol.
('8', 91, 7, 22, 218981) He (General Smuts) was quite justified in believing, because of the reports he had read, that the whole of this agitation depended upon a few Indians.
('8', 91, 7, 23, 219132) If it depended upon a few Indians only, and if the whole of his countrymen had not been acting together throughout the past sixteen months, then he thought they had proved that they deserved the Act.
('8', 91, 7, 24, 219332) But if, after he and his
('8', 92, 0, 1, 219357) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 93
('8', 92, 1, 2, 219401) colleagues were safely out of harms way, they remained firm, stuck together, and were prepared to suffer every inconvenience and to lose all, then he had not the slightest doubt that they would gain all, gain the estimation of all the reasonable Colonists whose estimation was worth prizing.
('8', 92, 1, 3, 219693) If they submitted to the Act it was true that they would be able to live a dogs life, and had [sic] earned the Colonists kicks.
('8', 92, 1, 4, 219821) The gates of the Registration Office [] it was highly probable [] would be flung open once more immediately he and his colleagues had retired from the scene, but he did hope that whatever they had said in public, whatever they had prayed for in secrecy before their God, they would carry out to the bitter end.
('8', 92, 1, 5, 220132) He hoped that no terrorism, no intimidation, no amount of meetings held by their fellow subjects, if he might call them so, held by European British subjects would deter them from the action that they had embarked upon.
('8', 92, 1, 6, 220352) There was no terror and no fear for a man who believed in God.
('8', 92, 2, 7, 220415) A STRUGGLE FOR RELIGIOUS LIBERTY
('8', 92, 3, 8, 220448) No matter what might be said he would always repeat that that was a struggle for religious liberty.
('8', 92, 3, 9, 220548) By religion he did not mean formal religion, or customary religion, but that religion which underlay all religions, which brought them face to face with their Maker.
('8', 92, 3, 10, 220714) If they ceased to be men, if on taking a deliberate vow they broke that vow in order that they might remain in the Transvaal without physical inconvenience, they undoubtedly forsook their God.
('8', 92, 3, 11, 220907) To repeat again the words of the Jew of Nazareth, those who would follow God had to leave the world, and he had called upon his countrymen in that particular instance to leave the world and cling to God as a child would cling to the mothers breast.
('8', 92, 3, 12, 221156) If they did that he had not the slightest doubt that this struggle could have but one issue.
('8', 92, 4, 13, 221249) A MONTH HENCE
('8', 92, 5, 14, 221263) It did not matter what General Smuts thought today, but it would matter what he thought a month hence, when they had shown, every one of them, that they were men.
('8', 92, 5, 15, 221426) He had not the slightest doubt that General Smuts had sufficient humanity in him to recognize the sincerity of purpose, the real feeling that underlay the community, and if they showed to him that the majority of Indians were not going to accept the Act, but would rather suffer imprisonment and degradation, forfeiture of all their goods, then General Smuts, without anybody going to him, would say, Yes, these are the people I shall prize as my citizens; these are the people whom I shall prize as fellow citizens with me and who will be of service to the State. But if they did not take up that position, then General Smuts would certainly also say, Yes, 10,000 Indians may remain in the Colony.
('8', 92, 5, 16, 222125) We can keep them as dogs and allow them todie their natural death. Their natural deaths they would die far outside the Transvaal, wherever there was a piece of earth given them, but if they would die a noble death, a mans death, there was only one course open to them.
('8', 92, 5, 17, 222394) If, perchance, even after they had taken that course it came to pass that every one of them had to leave the Transvaal, then was it not better that they should leave as men than remain as cowards
('8', 93, 0, 1, 222590) 94 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 93, 1, 2, 222631) who had gone back upon their sacred resolution taken at the old Empire Theatre?
('8', 93, 1, 3, 222711) He thought the whole of the Colony would rise and tell General Smuts, if the Colony was convinced that they were sincere, willing to suffer for their cause and country, religion and honour, then the Colonists would tell General Smuts he had not received a mandate to expel these people from the country.
('8', 93, 1, 4, 223015) They did not want future immigration, they did not want to remain there and set up undue competition with white people.
('8', 93, 1, 5, 223135) People who were capable of putting up a fight like that would not offer undue competition, but would fall in with any legislation that might be devised for the common good of all, but certainly not for the good of only a handful of store keepers.
('8', 93, 1, 6, 223382) If it were necessary that stores should be regulated for the common good of the country, why, they had offered it times without number.
('8', 93, 1, 7, 223518) They did not want to flood the Colony with Indians, but the handful of Indians who had a right to remain in the Transvaal should be allowed to remain as worthy citizens of a mighty Empire, but should not remain as beasts so long as he could help it.

('8', 93, 3, 10, 223834) [JOHANNESBURG, January 10, 1908]
('8', 93, 4, 11, 223867) The eastern side of Government Square presented an extraordinary scene of excitement this afternoon.
('8', 93, 4, 12, 223968) All through the lunch hour there was a big gathering of Indians, and at two oclock precisely a continuous stream of Indians indicated the approach of the leaders.
('8', 93, 4, 13, 224131) Mr. Gandhi was the first to appear.
('8', 93, 4, 14, 224167) It was drizzling, and his ardent admirers sheltered him with umbrellas as he walked along slowly reading the first edition of The Star.
('8', 93, 4, 15, 224303) The Indians kept pouring on to the Square, and the public entrance to the Court was blocked.
('8', 93, 4, 16, 224396) The Magistrate, Mr. Jordan, was seen walking through the crowd, and of course he attracted considerable attention.
('8', 93, 4, 17, 224511) At ten minutes past two the lock was heard in the door, and the press outside became greater.
('8', 93, 4, 18, 224605) The doors were flung open and the crowd was met by Captain Potter, Superintendent Vernon, and two police.
('8', 93, 4, 19, 224711) The officer ordered the entrance to be cleared and considerable confusion followed.
('8', 93, 4, 20, 224795) The dense mass swayed backward, and when it was possible for egress to be obtained by a few people at a time, people were allowed to pass in.
('8', 93, 4, 21, 224937) The Indians continued to force their way, and attempted to rush the police at the door.
('8', 93, 4, 22, 225025) The Commissioner of Police, who was in the Court, saw that the force at the door was strengthened, and the entrance was again cleared.

('8', 93, 5, 25, 225208) Joseph J. Doke wrote about this occasion of Gandhijis first imprisonment as follows: There is the trial in the B Criminal Court, a great mass of the excited Asiatics crushed in at the door, and spreading to a great crowd outside.
('8', 93, 5, 26, 225438) The cynical Magistrate with his face flushed, presiding at the Bench; the horse shoe of legal offices below.

('8', 94, 1, 2, 225644) occurred and the police made three arrests.
('8', 94, 1, 3, 225688) When the part of the Court reserved for the public was filled, further admission was denied, and a few minutes afterwards the Magistrate entered the Court.
('8', 94, 2, 4, 225844) Silence was called, and M. K. Gandhi was called.
('8', 94, 3, 5, 225893) A regular cordon of police was formed by mounted and foot police around the entrance to the Court.
('8', 94, 4, 6, 225992) Mr. M. K. Gandhi was first called, 1 and he pleaded guilty to the charge, which was one of disobeying the order of the Court to leave the Colony within 48 hours.
('8', 94, 5, 7, 226154) Mr. Fred Klette, clerk in B Court, went into the witness box and produced the records in the case Rex v.
('8', 94, 5, 8, 226259) Gandhi heard in that Court on the 28th of December.
('8', 94, 5, 9, 226311) Defendant was on that occasion ordered to leave the Colony within 48 hours.
('8', 94, 6, 10, 226387) Witness served a written order personally on the accused.
('8', 94, 7, 11, 226445) On being asked by the Magistrate if he had any questions to ask, Mr. Gandhi replied:
('8', 94, 8, 12, 226530) No, Sir.
('8', 94, 9, 13, 226539) Superintendent Vernon, B Division, said that at 2 p.m.
('8', 94, 9, 14, 226594) that afternoon he arrested the accused for failing to comply with the order.
('8', 94, 9, 15, 226671) He had seen the accused repeatedly from the date the order was made until today.
('8', 94, 10, 16, 226752) Mr. Gandhi had again no questions to ask.
('8', 94, 11, 17, 226794) Mr. Schuurman intimated that this was the case.
('8', 94, 12, 18, 226842) Mr. Gandhi asked leave to make a short statement, and, having obtained it, he said he thought there should be a distinction made between his case and those who [sic] were to follow.
('8', 94, 12, 19, 227024) He had just received a message from Pretoria stating that his compatriots had been tried there and had been sentenced to three months imprisonment with hard labour; and they had been fined a heavy amount, in lieu of payment of which they would receive a further period of three months hard labour.
('8', 94, 12, 20, 227322) If these men had committed an offence, he had committed a greater offence, and he asked the Magistrate to impose upon him the heaviest penalty.
('8', 94, 13, 21, 227466) MR. JORDAN: You asked for the heaviest penalty which the law authorizes?
('8', 94, 14, 22, 227539) MR. GANDHI: Yes, Sir.
('8', 94, 15, 23, 227561) MR. JORDAN: I must say I do not feel inclined to accede to your request of passing the heaviest sentence, which is six months hard labour with a fine of 500. That appears to me to be totally out of proportion to the offence which you have committed.
('8', 94, 15, 24, 227811) The offence practically is contempt of Court in having disobeyed the order of December 28. This is more or less a political offence, and if it had not been for the defiance setto the law I should have thought it my duty to pass the lowest
('8', 94, 16, 25, 228050) 1 Rand Daily Mail in its account of the trial also mentions John Fortoen, C. M. Pillay, P. K. Naidoo, M. Easton and M. E. Cadwa [Karwa], who were charged along with Gandhiji under the Asiatic Registration Act.

('8', 95, 4, 7, 228602) [JOHANNESBURG, January 10, 1908]
('8', 95, 5, 8, 228635) Asked for a final message previous to his incarceration, Mr. Gandhi gave the following to a Rand Daily Mail representative: I have undertaken this struggle prayerfully and in all humility believing in the entire righteousness of the cause, and I hope that one day the Colonists will do justice to my countrymen.
('8', 95, 5, 9, 228947) So far as my countrymen are concerned, I can only hope that they will remain firm in their sacred and solemn resolution.
('8', 95, 5, 10, 229068) By doing so they have nothing to lose.
('8', 95, 5, 11, 229107) Even though they may have to lose their all they can only gain in the esteem of their fellow men by being resolute.
('8', 95, 5, 12, 229223) I sincerely state that in effecting my arrest General Smuts has done a very honourable act.
('8', 95, 5, 13, 229315) He believes that my countrymen have been misled by me.
('8', 95, 5, 14, 229370) I am not conscious of having done so, but I may have been misled myself.
('8', 95, 5, 15, 229443) In any case removing me from the arena will show whether the position is real or unreal.
('8', 95, 5, 16, 229532) The position therefore is absolutely in our own hands.
('8', 95, 5, 17, 229587) Rand Daily Mail, 11 1 1908
('8', 95, 6, 18, 229614) 1 Gandhiji was somewhat agitated, as he recorded some years later; being alone in custody, he fell into deep thought.
('8', 95, 6, 19, 229732) Home, the Courts where I practised, the public meeting,all these passed away like a dream, and I was now a prisoner. If the people failed to fill the prisons, two months would be as tedious as an age.
('8', 95, 6, 20, 229933) But these thoughts soon filled him with shame.
('8', 95, 6, 21, 229980) And he recalled how he had asked people to look upon prisons as His Majestys hotels.
('8', 95, 6, 22, 230065) This second train of thought acted upon him as a bracing tonic.

('8', 96, 3, 4, 230292) THE PETITION OF THE UNDERSIGNED BEING AT PRESENT PRISONERS IN HIS MAJESTY S GAOL AT JOHANNESBURG
('8', 96, 4, 5, 230389) HUMBLY SHEWETH THAT
('8', 96, 5, 6, 230409) The Petitioners are all Asiatics, in all twenty one.
('8', 96, 5, 7, 230462) Eighteen of the Petitioners are British Indians and three are Chinese.
('8', 96, 5, 8, 230533) The eighteen British Indians get mealie meal for breakfast.
('8', 96, 5, 9, 230593) Of the other fourteen meals seven consist of rice and ghee, three of beans and four of mealie meal.
('8', 96, 5, 10, 230693) On Saturdays potatoes and on Sundays vegetables are: added to the mealie meal.
('8', 96, 5, 11, 230772) For religious reasons all the above are vegetarianssome only because they cannot get religiously killed meat or proper meat.
('8', 96, 5, 12, 230897) The Chinese get whole mealies and fat in place of rice and ghee.
('8', 96, 5, 13, 230962) All the Petitioners have been either in the habit of taking European food or mostly sotheir staple consisting either of bread or some preparation of flour.
('8', 96, 5, 14, 231118) None of your Petitioners has been used to taking mealie meal.
('8', 96, 5, 15, 231180) They are most of them suffering from constipation, probably due to the eating of mealie meal.
('8', 96, 5, 16, 231274) Seven of the Petitioners have gone without breakfast ever since their incarceration except that some Chinese witnesses, knowing their plight, once parted with one loaf which was divided among them.
('8', 96, 5, 17, 231472) This was only brought to the notice of the Governor, who said the witnesses ought not to have done so.
('8', 96, 5, 18, 231575) In the Petitioners humble opinion, the diet above referred to is totally unsuitable for them.
('8', 96, 5, 19, 231669) The Petitioners, therefore, humbly pray that the diet according to European scale with the exception of mealie meal may be prescribed for them, or such other diet as may be considered suitable to keep body and soul together and may be consistent with their national habits, or habits formed by prolonged residence in South Africa.
('8', 96, 5, 20, 232000) As the matter is one of extreme emergency, the Petitioners crave

('8', 97, 5, 9, 232734) JOHANNESBURG GAOL, January 28, 1908 2
('8', 97, 6, 10, 232772) TO THE HONBLE THE COLONIAL SECRETARY OF THE TRANSVAAL
('8', 97, 7, 11, 232826) SIR, As representatives of the Indian and the Chinese communities 3
('8', 97, 8, 12, 232894) who have taken a prominent part in the opposition to the Asiatic Registration Amendment Act, we have the honour to lay the following considerations before you: Our opposition has never been directed so much against the fingerprint requirements of the Regulations under the Actin so far as such finger prints were deemed necessary for the identification of Asiatics who could not very well be otherwise identifiedas against the element of compulsion contained in the Act itself.
('8', 97, 8, 13, 233372) On that ground we have repeatedly offered to undergo voluntary registration if the Act were repealed.
('8', 97, 8, 14, 233474) And even now at this late hour we would urge on the Government the adoption as far as possible of the course more than once proposed by us.
('8', 97, 8, 15, 233614) We recognize that it is not possible during the Parliamentary recess to repeal the Act, and we have noted your repeated public declarations that there is no likelihood of the Act being repealed.
('8', 97, 9, 16, 233809) 1 This letter as well as the draft Cartwright brought to Gandhiji in jail were published in Indian Opinion, 11 7 1908. The draft was either prepared or approved by General Smuts; vide Satyagraha in South Africa, Ch. XXI and Johannesburg Letter, p.
('8', 97, 9, 17, 234057) 66. There exist four sources for this letter: the Pretoria Archives; the records of the Colonial Office to whom a copy of this letter was sent by the Transvaal Government; an office copy of the Cartwright draft together with handwritten changes made at Gandhijis instance (S. N. 4907); and Indian Opinion.
('8', 97, 9, 18, 234363) 2 The Indian Opinion version, however, is dated January 29, 1908. 3 The Cartwright draft has only the Indian community.

('8', 98, 1, 2, 234527) would however point out that the periods fixed for registration under the Act by the various Government Notices have expired and that therefore anyregistration at present would necessarily have to be of that voluntary nature which we originally prayed the Government to concede 1. Under these circumstances we would once more respectfully suggest to the Government that all Asiatics over the age of sixteen years 2 should be allowed within a certain limited period, say three months, to register themselves, and that to all who so register, the Act 3 be not applied, and that the Government take whatever steps they deem advisable to legalize such registration.
('8', 98, 1, 3, 235189) Such mode of registra tion should apply to those also who being out of the Colony may return and otherwise possess the rights of re entry.
('8', 98, 2, 4, 235328) In taking the registration of Asiatics we do not object that the requirements of the Act and the regulations be as nearly as possible 5 complied with, provided the registration officials do not press for any information which offends the religious sense of the applicants, and receive discretion to dispense with the finger print requirement in the case of those applicants who by reason of their education or property or public character are well known or can be easily identified other wise.
('8', 98, 2, 5, 235822) In those cases we urge that the officials should have discretion to accept the signature of the applicant as a sufficient identification.
('8', 98, 2, 6, 235960) Should the Government agree to these suggestions and accept 6 registration on these terms, we assume that all further prosecutions or punishments under the Act will be suspended during the period set aside for registration.
('8', 98, 2, 7, 236184) We on our part again would undertake to use all our influence to induce our compatriots to register and withdraw all
('8', 98, 3, 8, 236301) 1 The offer of voluntary registration, which was an alternative to compulsory registration of all Asiatics envisaged by the Asiatic Law Amendment Ordinance, was first made at the Transvaal Indian mass meeting of March 29, 1907. Vide Mass Meeting of Transvaal Indians, 6 4 1907. 2 The words over the age of sixteen years do not occur in Cartwrights draft.
('8', 98, 3, 9, 236656) Gandhiji added the words over the age of 16.
('8', 98, 3, 10, 236701) The additional word years found in the Pretoria Archives version would suggest that the Cartwright draft together with Gandhijis substantial emendations on it (S. N. 4907) was re typed and minor changes of a purely verbal character made on a subsequent draft which is not available.
('8', 98, 3, 11, 236984) 3 The draft has the penalties of the Act be not applied from which Gandhiji deleted the words penalties of the.
('8', 98, 3, 12, 237096) 4 This sentence does not exist in the draft and was added by Gandhiji.

('8', 99, 1, 2, 237346) countenance from those who refuse to register or are not legally entitled to register.
('8', 99, 1, 3, 237433) We put forward the above suggestions because we are sincerely anxious to prove to the Government that we are loyal and law abiding, and that we are willing to adopt any course which will lead out of thepresent difficulty without violating our consciences 1, inflicting any indignity or casting 2 any stigma on us.

('8', 99, 5, 8, 238048) Mr. Gandhi on his return [from Pretoria] was seen by a Mail representative...
('8', 99, 6, 9, 238126) Many questions regarding the compromise were immediately levelled at his head....
('8', 99, 7, 10, 238208) [REPORTER:] Honourable to both sides, Mr. Gandhi?
('8', 99, 7, 11, 238258) [GANDHIJI:] Perfectly.
('8', 99, 7, 12, 238281) The honour of the Colony has not been affected in the least, while the feelings and scruples of the Asiatics have received the fullest consideration.
('8', 99, 8, 13, 238431) Then it is no climb down?
('8', 99, 8, 14, 238457) Absolutely not.
('8', 99, 8, 15, 238473) We have merely made an arrangement by which the whole question has been satisfactorily settledsatisfactory to all parties concerned.
('8', 99, 9, 16, 238606) 1 violating our consciences added by Gandhiji.
('8', 99, 9, 17, 238653) The Pretoria Archives version has, however, conscience in the singular.

('8', 100, 1, 2, 239278) Anything more?
('8', 100, 2, 3, 239293) Mr. Gandhi drew the line here and intimated that the time was not opportune to say anything further regarding the negotiations.
('8', 100, 3, 4, 239421) Our representative then noticed that Mr. Gandhis head was closely cropped and that his moustache was cut.
('8', 100, 3, 5, 239527) He was asked whether he had been subjected to the regulations usually applied to criminals.
('8', 100, 3, 6, 239619) No, this is all my own doing.
('8', 100, 3, 7, 239649) As you know prisoners are not allowed the use of combs and brushes, so from hygienic motives I applied to the Governor of the Fort to be allowed to have myself cropped.
('8', 100, 3, 8, 239818) He demurred at first but finally consented andnow look at me
('8', 100, 4, 9, 239879) How were you treated while in the Fort?
('8', 100, 4, 10, 239919) With as much consideration as the Governor could possibly allow me under the regulations.
('8', 100, 4, 11, 240009) I must express my appreciation of the manner in which we were treated by the officials there, but their powers in this direction are limited.
('8', 100, 5, 12, 240151) And the food?
('8', 100, 5, 13, 240165) The usual diet.
('8', 100, 6, 14, 240181) In what part of the prison were you placed?
('8', 100, 6, 15, 240225) In the Native section.
('8', 100, 7, 16, 240248) This was all the conversation that could be had during the short journey to the Mosque at Fordsburg.
('8', 100, 7, 17, 240349) At the latter gathering place Mr. Gandhi met a number of his compatriotsalthough the hour was past midnight.
('8', 100, 7, 18, 240458) To these faithful henchmen he briefly explained what had led to his release.
('8', 100, 8, 19, 240535) The impression gained during the conversation given above was that Mr. Gandhi was in no way inclined to consider his release from gaol as a victory to the participants m the passive resistance movement.
('8', 100, 8, 20, 240738) On the other hand he seemed keenly pleased that a settlement had been come to by which neither side had suffered in honour, integrity or prestige

('8', 100, 11, 24, 241020) [JOHANNESBURG, January 30, 1908]
('8', 100, 12, 25, 241053) Yesterday morning some Indian hawkers saw, as they believed, Mr. Gandhi proceed to the Railway Station in company with another gentleman, who proved to be Superintendent Vernon, who is in charge of the Fordsburg Police Station.
('8', 100, 13, 26, 241281) 1 This was republished with minor variations in Indian Opinion, 8 2 1908.
('8', 101, 0, 1, 241355) 102 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 101, 1, 2, 241397) was, however, no certainty that it was Mr. Gandhi, and the fact of his having been seen was the basis of an interesting rumour only.
('8', 101, 1, 3, 241530) As a fact, the Indians referred to were quite correct in their conjecture, for about a quarter past eleven Mr. Gandhi left the Port for Park Station, whither he proceeded with Superintendent Vernon to Pretoria.
('8', 101, 1, 4, 241741) But Mr. Gandhis releaseit technically takes place only todaycame as a great surprise to his compatriots last night.
('8', 101, 1, 5, 241857) Mr. Gandhi returned from Pretoria at 10 oclock, and there was no one to meet him except the Chairman of the British Indian Association Mr. Essop Miaso well had the secret of the whole position been kept.
('8', 101, 1, 6, 242061) A Leader representative sought an interview with Mr. Gandhi after his arrival.
('8', 101, 1, 7, 242140) In general health he seemed none the worse for his recent experiences, and was quite cheerful.
('8', 101, 2, 8, 242235) PRISON TREATMENT
('8', 101, 3, 9, 242252) Asked as to the treatment meted out to him in prison, Mr. Gandhi replied that he and his fellow prisoners could not be sufficiently grateful to the Governor and all the other officials for the kindness and consideration shown to them within the four corners of the prison regulations.
('8', 101, 3, 10, 242537) But he added there was much to be said with respect to those regulations, and the accommodation and diet provided for Asiatics, who, to all intents and purposes, with one or two exceptions, were classed with Natives.
('8', 101, 3, 11, 242754) Mr. Gandhi, however, preferred to explain the position more fully at a later stage.
('8', 101, 4, 12, 242838) THE COMPROMISE
('8', 101, 5, 13, 242853) Replying to questions on the larger issue, Mr. Gandhi remarked: The compromise arrived at is largely the same that was offered by the Asiatic communities before proceedings under the Registration Act were commenced.
('8', 101, 5, 14, 243069) This compromise will give complete identification of every Asiatic over the age of 16 years in the Colony, and those who may be entitled to remain in or re enter it.
('8', 101, 5, 15, 243235) The main distinction between the Act and the identification under the offer will consist in the sting of compulsion being removed.
('8', 101, 5, 16, 243366) The compromise puts Asiatics on their honour and responsibility, and if it is not carried out faithfully by my countrymen I have no doubt that our position will deservedly be worse than it would have been under the Act.
('8', 101, 5, 17, 243586) But I do not anticipate any difficulty.
('8', 101, 5, 18, 243626) With reference to the wholesale arrests that have taken place during the last three weeks, I do not think that Asiatics can have any cause to grumble; that procedure was necessary in order to test the intensityas also the realityof our feeling about the Act.
('8', 101, 5, 19, 243885) I may state that we who were at the Fort were allowed to petition the Government offering once more voluntary registration, and the course adopted by the Government was in response to that petition 1. In my humble opinion the Government have shown real

('8', 102, 1, 2, 244230) strength in acceding to the request.
('8', 102, 1, 3, 244267) I would further and at this stage say that the leaders of the Asiatic communities, so far as I am aware, will loyally abide by the decision of the Colonists to avoid further immigration of Asiatics not entitled to enter by reason of previous domicile.

('8', 102, 3, 5, 244547) Last night a representative of the Leader gathered that today the incarcerated Indians, numbering some 220, will be set at liberty.
('8', 102, 3, 6, 244679) As far as Johannesburg is concerned, there is no intention of holding anything in the nature of a demonstra tion, and the next few days will be devoted by the leaders of the Asiatics to the quiet instruction oftheir compatriots as to the new position of affairs.
('8', 102, 3, 7, 244942) The leaders have every confidence that the compromise will be faithfully carried out.

('8', 102, 6, 11, 245130) THE EDITOR, INDIAN OPINION
('8', 102, 7, 12, 245157) SIR, My fellow prisoners and I have been inundated with telegrams of congratulation on what the senders have considered a victory for the Indian cause.
('8', 102, 7, 13, 245309) We can only consider it a victory for Truth.
('8', 102, 7, 14, 245354) In any case may I on behalf of my associates and myself, through the columns of this journal, thank the numerous senders of wires and writers of letters for their kindly thought.
('8', 102, 7, 15, 245533) It has not been possible to write to individuals, for which omission, being unavoidable, I trust they will excuse us.
('8', 102, 7, 16, 245651) I hope and pray to the Almighty that, should the occasion arise again, we will all be prepared to undergo imprisonment or any other hardship if such it may be calledfor the sake of Truth, Honour and Self respect.

('8', 102, 9, 18, 245914) 1 The Gujarati version of this letter (p.
('8', 102, 9, 19, 245956) 55) is dated February 2, 1908. The English letter was presumably written between January 30 and February 2, 1908.

('8', 103, 1, 2, 246112) 58. SPEECH AT MEETING OF BRITISH INDIAN ASSOCIATION 1
('8', 103, 2, 3, 246166) [JOHANNESBURG, January 31, 1908] It is God in whom I placed my trust while launching on this struggle and advising the people to do likewise; it is He who has given us this unexpected victory, and it is to Him therefore that we must give our thanks.
('8', 103, 2, 4, 246416) It is because I have always believed that God helps the cause of truth that I started this movement in His name.
('8', 103, 2, 5, 246529) The success we have achieved is there for all of us to see.
('8', 103, 2, 6, 246589) What has made the Government remit the sentences and open the prison gates and let the people out?
('8', 103, 2, 7, 246688) Surely our truthfulness and strength.
('8', 103, 2, 8, 246726) I used to say that, if we scrupulously followed the path of truth, the white Colonists themselves would veer to our side, and that is exactly what has happened.
('8', 103, 2, 9, 246887) We are also thankful to the whites for the pains they took to further our just cause.
('8', 103, 2, 10, 246973) They did so because they were inspired by God within to have sympathy for His oppressed devotees, and to fight on their behalf.
('8', 103, 2, 11, 247101) I need not refer to the remark General Smuts made in the course of a speech 2 that it was impossible to send everyone to gaol.
('8', 103, 2, 12, 247228) All these things indicate that, if the [Indian] community remains united, it will always win through.
('8', 103, 2, 13, 247330) We will now register voluntarily for purposes of identification and the scrutiny [of our rights of domicile] and the Government has accepted this [offer].
('8', 103, 2, 14, 247485) That means that the obnoxious law will die altogether.
('8', 103, 2, 15, 247540) The stigma that attached to us under the law will now disappear.
('8', 103, 2, 16, 247605) Under the proposed arrangement, the Government will accept signatures by educated persons and by owners of property, but unlettered people have to give ten finger prints on the application forms.
('8', 103, 2, 17, 247801) Though I am against this myself and will strive with the Government to the best of my ability to have the requirement waived, I see nothing wrong in having to give finger impressions if the Government does not come round.
('8', 103, 2, 18, 248023) For after all we shall be giving them of our own free choice.
('8', 103, 2, 19, 248085) They must not be given if they are made compulsory.
('8', 103, 2, 20, 248137) And the Government has allowed us a period of three
('8', 103, 3, 21, 248189) 1 On the evening of the day of his release, Gandhiji explained the terms of the compromise to fellow Indians at a public meeting held under the auspices of the British Indian Association.

('8', 104, 1, 2, 248615) months for the matter to be settled.
('8', 104, 1, 3, 248652) I will therefore strive to obtain the best [terms] that I can for the Indian community.
('8', 104, 1, 4, 248740) Under the law, the Government wanted the compulsory registration of children, and this [provision] too, has now been dropped.
('8', 104, 1, 5, 248866) The question of amending the law suitably will be taken up when Parliament meets in Pretoria.
('8', 104, 1, 6, 248960) For the present, however, the sentences of imprisonment against us have been set aside, and it is now up to us to prove that we are honourable men.
('8', 104, 1, 7, 249108) It will be no use having anything in writing from the Government, since the final authority is that of Parliament.
('8', 104, 1, 8, 249223) We have thus to depend only on what Parliament does.
('8', 104, 1, 9, 249276) Just as Lord Roberts and others used to make promises to us on behalf of the Imperial Parliament, so has the Colonial Secretary set us free in anticipation of Parliaments approval.
('8', 104, 1, 10, 249457) When Parliament meets, we shall be delivered from this law 1. That is, the Act will be repealed and theImmigration Bill will be suitably amended.
('8', 104, 1, 11, 249603) The object of the Government will thus be secured, and we shall get the freedom that we have been demanding.
('8', 104, 1, 12, 249712) The reason why we have won is that people went to gaol,150 from Johannesburg, 25 from Pretoria and many persons from other towns as well.
('8', 104, 1, 13, 249850) Women did their true duty.
('8', 104, 1, 14, 249877) The pickets in particular displayed unsurpassed skill which even the Government could not help admiring; the selfsame Government [which had resisted our demands earlier] came round clearly because it perceived the strength of the community.
('8', 104, 1, 15, 250118) A campaign that is carried on in the name of God cannot but end in success.
('8', 104, 1, 16, 250194) I am hopeful that I shall succeed in the matter of fingerprints also.
('8', 104, 1, 17, 250264) We have, however, no reason to feel triumphant over the measure of success that we have achieved, neither have the whites any cause to complain against the Government.
('8', 104, 1, 18, 250432) Even God is won over by humility.
('8', 104, 1, 19, 250466) It is, therefore, humility which will ensure our success in a just struggle.
('8', 104, 1, 20, 250543) We must not play foul with the Government; rather, by adopting the highest standard of conduct for ourselves, we must convince the Government and the white Colonists that we do respect laws which uphold our dignity.
('8', 104, 1, 21, 250759) If, through an oversight on the part of the Government, the door is left open and there is scope for some kind of fraud, our duty will be to shut that door.
('8', 104, 1, 22, 250916) The Government will see for itself that we do not practise deception.
('8', 104, 1, 23, 250986) When we have thuscreated a [favourable] impression on the minds of the Colonists by acquitting ourselves as befits us, the redress of our grievances is

('8', 105, 1, 3, 251224) Equally, the Government will be unable to go back on its commitment to us, for we have the great weapon of passive resistance.
('8', 105, 1, 4, 251351) That was the weapon with which we brought the Government to its senses.
('8', 105, 1, 5, 251423) Whatever the Government does now, it will do with the consent of our people.
('8', 105, 1, 6, 251500) As long as we are ready to go to gaol and fight on, we shall wield sufficient power over the Government to make it do the right thing.
('8', 105, 1, 7, 251635) Whatever we plan to do now must be kept wholly confidential.
('8', 105, 1, 8, 251696) Should anyone among us be found carrying information to the Government or some other party, he will have proved himself a veritable traitor.
('8', 105, 1, 9, 251837) Nothing can be gained by playing the spy to the Government; on the contrary, it will be of advantage to remain with the community.
('8', 105, 1, 10, 251968) Even those who have taken out registers 1 under the new law may gain their freedom if they take out registers under the proposed arrangement.
('8', 105, 1, 11, 252110) We must also prove ourselves to be as good as our word, and thus furnish an earnest of our sincerity.
('8', 105, 1, 12, 252212) As soon as Parliament meets, the [AsiaticRegistration] Act will be repealed and the immigration law amended.
('8', 105, 1, 13, 252321) That is to say, domicile certificates will be issued as they are in Durban.
('8', 105, 1, 14, 252397) We have to thank those who gave us real help.
('8', 105, 1, 15, 252443) We should pass a resolution expressing our gratitude to Mr. Polak 2, Mr. Ritch 3, and

('8', 106, 4, 6, 254226) Mr. Gandhi interviewed said that those who proved their right to a domicile should not only be left in the Colony unmolested, but should be given every encoura gement, so that instead of remaining a festering sore, they might as far as possible be assimilated and form part of the future South African nation.
('8', 106, 4, 7, 254536) The dominant race should look forward to the time when the lower races should be raised higher in the scale of civilization.
('8', 106, 4, 8, 254661) Mr. Gandhi agreed with General Smuts that the system of indentured labour in Natal should be stopped at any sacrifice.

('8', 107, 5, 9, 256209) JOHANNESBURG, February 1, 1908
('8', 107, 6, 10, 256240) DEAR MR. SMUTS, After the conversation that Mr. Chamney had with me on Thursday, I sought an interview with you again, and Mr. Lane 3 told me thatI would be able to see you before I went.
('8', 107, 6, 11, 256428) I was not, however, fortunate enough to do so.
('8', 107, 6, 12, 256475) The conversation with Mr. Chamney made me a little uncom fortable, because he still harped away on the Asiatic Act.
('8', 107, 6, 13, 256591) Indeed, from him I gathered that the registration that will now proceed will be legalized under that Act.
('8', 107, 6, 14, 256697) At the interview with you, I did not under stand any such thing at all, and the joint letter 4 of Messrs Quinn, Naidoo and myself, too, makes it clear.
('8', 107, 6, 15, 256849) I am most anxious to see this business finished without the slightest difficulty and with perfect satis faction to yourself.
('8', 107, 6, 16, 256974) I am, therefore, naturally most anxious to avoid any misunderstanding.
('8', 107, 6, 17, 257045) Pray believe me also when I say that I shall leave no stone unturned to remove the difficulties in your path owing to the clamour of anti Asiatic agitators.
('8', 107, 6, 18, 257202) May I, therefore, ask you to
('8', 107, 7, 19, 257231) 1 This is part of a precise of events in the Transvaal Ritch enclosed with his letter to the Colonial Office, dated October 6, 1908. 2 The entire Gandhi Smuts correspondence between February 1, 1908 and June 13, 1908 was reproduced in Indian Opinion under the title Was Repeal Promised?
('8', 107, 7, 20, 257518) Complete Correspondence.
('8', 107, 7, 21, 257543) A copy of this letter was sent by Ritch as an annexure to his letter of July 27, 1908 to the Colonial Office.

('8', 108, 1, 2, 257771) be good enough to re assure me on the point?
('8', 108, 1, 3, 257816) To legalize voluntary registration under the Asiatic Act would be to re open the question at the sorest point.
('8', 108, 1, 4, 257927) You were good enough to tell me that the method of legalization 1 will be discussed later on as between us.
('8', 108, 1, 5, 258035) I have already suggested that the best way to do so would be under the Immigrants Restriction Act by amending it in so far as may be necessary.
('8', 108, 1, 6, 258179) I take it, too, that the form of application and registration will be settled in consultation with the leaders of the community, and that this will be done as quickly as possible, so that registration may proceed.
('8', 108, 1, 7, 258393) I left a message, too, with Mr. Lane with reference to the ten finger prints.
('8', 108, 1, 8, 258471) I discussed this with Mr. Chamney, and he could show absolutely no justification for the ten finger prints.
('8', 108, 1, 9, 258579) Indeed he admi tted that, for identification, one thumb impression was quite sufficient.
('8', 108, 1, 10, 258668) While to me, personally, it is immaterial whether thumb prints or digit impressions be given, there are many amongst the Asiatics to whom the latter present an impassable difficulty, and, as I know you want only effective identification, I do hope you will accept thumb impressions.
('8', 108, 1, 11, 258951) In answer to my inquiry, I have now received telegrams from the Protector of Indentured Immigrants and the Principal Immigration Restriction Officer in Natal.
('8', 108, 1, 12, 259110) The Protector says:
('8', 108, 2, 13, 259130) The system of taking ten finger impressions from indentured Indians on arrival commenced in April 1903, on being found desirable.
('8', 108, 2, 14, 259260) The Immigration Restriction Officer who controls the immigration of free Asiatics has replied as follows:
('8', 108, 3, 15, 259366) Referring yours of date both thumb impressions only required for certificates issued in this Department.
('8', 108, 3, 16, 259471) You will now see that the information given to you by Captain (?) Clarke is incorrect.
('8', 108, 3, 17, 259558) The distinction observed by the Immigration Department and the Protectors Department, too, is most valuable testimony in favour of my contention.
('8', 108, 3, 18, 259704) The Protector has to deal with a class of Asiatics who have every temptation to hide their identity.
('8', 108, 3, 19, 259805) Classification in their case is, therefore, necessary.
('8', 108, 3, 20, 259860) The Immigration Department has to deal with a class of Asiatics and others who have always to prove their identity in order to make good their claim to enter or remain in Natal.
('8', 108, 3, 21, 260038) Hence that Department requires only thumb impressions.
('8', 108, 3, 22, 260093) Does not this show conclusively that you do not need digit impressions at all?
('8', 108, 3, 23, 260172) And, as my expert adviser tells me, the system
('8', 108, 4, 24, 260219) 1 The version available in India Office Records has legislation.
('8', 109, 0, 1, 260284) 110 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 109, 1, 2, 260326) of classification, besides being totally unnecessary, is costly compared to the system of identification merely.
('8', 109, 1, 3, 260439) At the Cape, too, only thumb prints are required.
('8', 109, 1, 4, 260489) And, in this connection, I do wish to impress upon you the fact that the question of discretion is an element which will lead to favouritism and even fraud ultimately.
('8', 109, 1, 5, 260657) A man who may be perfectly wealthy, I need hardly point out, is not necessarily an honest man, and yet, because he may be known otherwise, his signature alone will be accepted.
('8', 109, 1, 6, 260834) To my mind, the only exception that should be made in the case of those who may be able to pass the education test prescri bed by the Immigration Act.
('8', 109, 1, 7, 260985) These, of course, carry identification on their own persons, but with reference to the others, speaking from experience, I urge that the discretion be dropped; but if you insist on ten finger prints there will be applications wholesale for the exercise of discretion, and I am positive, armed as I am with expert opinion on finger impressions, that you do not need ten finger prints for identifi cation.
('8', 109, 1, 8, 261389) I also venture to suggest that the open permission to Indians to trade without licences will give rise to bickerings amongst the Colonists.
('8', 109, 1, 9, 261529) Do you not think it will be better either to issue licences or to take from them deposit of licence fee against provisional receipts?
('8', 109, 1, 10, 261663) I hope I have done the proper thing in adopting a familiar tone in writing this letter, which is purely personal and confidential, and your reply will be also so treated.
('8', 109, 1, 11, 261834) If in any of the public statements I have been making you think that I have been at all indiscreet, pray correct me.

('8', 110, 3, 4, 262187) DEAR MR. AND MRS.
('8', 110, 3, 5, 262205) VOGL1, Kindly accept my thanks for your congratulations 2. I do indeed believe that your good wishes are an expression of the Heart and not merely a formal one.
('8', 110, 3, 6, 262366) Mahomed Khan 3 told me yesterday that Mrs. Vogl was keeping indifferent health.
('8', 110, 3, 7, 262446) I was sorry to hear it.
('8', 110, 3, 8, 262470) I wish I could come over to see her as also to thank you both personally, but just at present I must know no rest.
('8', 110, 3, 9, 262585) The work of destruction is finished, that of construction has commenceda far more difficult one, but, seeing that I have not relied upon my own strength but on the strength of Truth, otherwise spelt God, I am quite at ease.
('8', 110, 4, 10, 262809) Yours sincerely, M. K. GANDHI

('8', 110, 6, 12, 262904) 64. INTERVIEW TO THE PRESS 4
('8', 110, 7, 13, 262933) [JOHANNESBURG, February 1, 1908] .
('8', 110, 7, 14, 262968) This campaign has undoubtedly shown one thing, if it has shown anythingthat Indians in the Transvaal are deserving of self respect and of being classed as men.
('8', 110, 7, 15, 263128) The charge has often been brought against them that they are incapable of acting in concert for the com mon good.
('8', 110, 7, 16, 263242) I think I can fairly claim for my countrymen that they have shown unexampled self sacrifice.
('8', 110, 7, 17, 263335) Hundreds of poor hawkers, rather than pay the small fines that were inflicted on them by the magistrate, underwent the hardships of prison life, simply for the sake of principle.
('8', 110, 7, 18, 263514) In the course of my practice I have not noticed many clients who have been willing to go to gaol when there has been the option of a fine.
('8', 110, 7, 19, 263653) They have been willing to pay the heaviest fines
('8', 110, 8, 20, 263702) 1 Vogl was a draper.
('8', 110, 8, 21, 263723) He and his wife sympathized with the Indian campaign.
('8', 110, 8, 22, 263777) Mrs. Vogl took a keen interest in Indian women and conducted classes for them.
('8', 110, 8, 23, 263856) 2 On Gandhijis release from jail 3 An employee of Gandhiji, and a satyagrahi 4 This was published in Indian Opinion under the title Mr. Gandhi Inter viewed: Playing the Game.
('8', 110, 8, 24, 264031) As for the date of the interview, vide 1st footnote of Interview to the Press, 1 2 1908.
('8', 111, 0, 1, 264120) 112 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 111, 1, 2, 264162) if thereby they could avoid imprisonment.
('8', 111, 1, 3, 264204) I must say that, to a certain extent, the cohesion that has been shown by the poorest Indians in the Colony has been an eye opener even to me, and I have no doubt it has been to the Colonists.
('8', 111, 1, 4, 264397) I think it might also, therefore, be claimed that if the compromise that has now been arrived at is honourable to Indians, as it undoubtedly is to the Government, Indians have figura tively bled for it.
('8', 111, 1, 5, 264600) It is not possible to give an adequate idea of the sacrifice made by hundreds of Indians, and in this category I includethose Indians who left the Colony because they did not consider themselves strong enough to brave the struggle.
('8', 111, 1, 6, 264832) Merchants with large stocks in the Colony were perfectly resigned to any consequences, but they would not submit to a law which in their estimation degraded them.
('8', 111, 1, 7, 264995) It was necessary, I think, for British Indians to show as much as they have, before they could claim to be trusted, and in accepting the petition the Government have done nothing more than give British Indians three months grace.
('8', 111, 1, 8, 265225) We are now put upon our mettle.
('8', 111, 1, 9, 265257) To my mind the real work commences only now.
('8', 111, 1, 10, 265302) We have to play the game.
('8', 111, 1, 11, 265328) We have to show to the Government and to the Colonists that Indians as a body have nothing to do with surreptitious entrythat although there is no legal obligation we recognize a moral obligation to give the Government complete identification of every Asiatic who is entitled to remain in the Colony or to re enter it, and if we succeed in doing that I think that the bitterest opponent of British Indians will have to admit that those who prove their right to domicile and give the Government full particulars as to identification should not only be left in the Colony unmolested, but that they should have every encourage ment, so that instead of remaining in the Colony as a festering sore they may so far as possible be assimilated and form part of the future South African nation.
('8', 111, 1, 12, 266114) I do think that the highest statesmanship in South Africa consists not in treating any class of its inhabitants as almost animals or pariahs, but it consists in treating them as men, and raising them to a higher level.
('8', 111, 1, 13, 266333) The question of unfair competition and such other questions crop up only because sometimes one notices cases of unfair competition, but all these matters can certainly be rem edied if the different races living in South Africa were to be educated up to a proper sense of citizenship.
('8', 111, 1, 14, 266617) By proper citizenship I dont for one moment claim that all the races should be clothed with the franchise, but I do claim that the dominant race should look forward to a time when those lower races will be raised higher in the scale.
('8', 111, 1, 15, 266851) Looking at the whole question in that light, I for one have no hesi tation in agreeing entirely with General Smuts remarks with reference to the indentured Indians in Natal.
('8', 111, 1, 16, 267025) As a matter of fact, the British
('8', 112, 0, 1, 267058) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 113
('8', 112, 1, 2, 267103) Indian population there has always submitted that indentured labour should be stopped, no matter at what sacrifice.
('8', 112, 1, 3, 267219) Indiansthat is,free Indianshave never countenanced nor wanted the system of indent ured labour, and I admit that, but for the system of indentured labour Natal, the Asiatic question would not have caused the trouble it has.
('8', 112, 1, 4, 267443) I certainly believe that, so long as Natal continues to import indentured labour, so long will there be some trouble or other in connection with Asiatics.
('8', 112, 1, 5, 267598) But I dont wish, in making this statement, to be understood as saying that indentured Indians, after regaining their freedom, have been flooding the Transvaal.
('8', 112, 1, 6, 267758) I know such statements have been made before now, but I am positive there is absolutely no foundation for them, if only for the reason that the supervision over indentured Indians is very strict, and no Indian from India is allowed to leave the Colony unless he has received his free pass.
('8', 112, 1, 7, 268048) The Immigration Department of Natal is practically in a position to trace every indentured Indian.
('8', 112, 2, 8, 268147) Questioned with regard to his experiences in the Fort, Mr. Gandhi said: So far as the gaol authorities are concerned, they could not have been more considerate.
('8', 112, 2, 9, 268308) The Governor and all other officials were most kind and courteous.
('8', 112, 2, 10, 268375) The Governor paid a visit every day, and regularly enquired whether we had any complaints or requests to make, and, if there were any, they were promptly remedied.
('8', 112, 2, 11, 268539) Any request that could be granted within the regulations was immediately granted.
('8', 112, 2, 12, 268621) Facilities were given for taking out books from the Prison Library and for receiving books from outside.
('8', 112, 2, 13, 268726) Mr. Gandhi added that, lest a remark in yesterdays Transvaal Leader 1 should be misunderstood, he desired to state that the gaol premises, so far as he was concerned, were kept scrupulously clean, the only exception being a place where prisoners who
('8', 112, 3, 14, 268976) 1This is presumably a reference to the following in a Transvaal Leader news item announcing Gandhijis release and the terms of the settlement between the British Indians and General Smuts.
('8', 112, 3, 15, 269165) ...The relief with which the Asiatics themselves will once more breathe free air will scarcely exceed that of the prison officials at getting rid of involuntary guests who, owing to their number, the peculiarities of their diet and their non criminal character have tried the resources of several of the public gaols to their utmost.
('8', 112, 3, 16, 269499) The sufferings of the prisoners have been acute.
('8', 112, 3, 17, 269548) In one little yard in the Johannesburg Prison, the capacity of which is 45, over 150 men had to pass their days during this trying weather.
('8', 112, 3, 18, 269688) Two of the Indians dropped down in the ranks, fainting on account of the heat.
('8', 112, 3, 19, 269767) The Asiatics complain bitterly that the room at the Johannesburg Prison, in which they were taken to have their clothing changed on entering the prison, had its roof and sides so full of vermin that it was impossible to keep their clothes or hair free from the pesta state of things due to the age and rottenness of the wood.... This news item appeared in The Transvaal Leader, 31 1 1908 and this interview therefore took place on February 1, 1908.

('8', 113, 1, 3, 270315) This place was full of bugs, which came, however, from the woodwork, and its condition was not the fault of the gaol officials, but was due to the cramped space at their disposal.

('8', 113, 3, 6, 270605) SIR, The Association, my fellow prisoners and I have been flooded with telegrams of congratulations.
('8', 113, 3, 7, 270706) Many letters have also been received.
('8', 113, 3, 8, 270744) There is no time to send individual replies.
('8', 113, 3, 9, 270789) May I, therefore, on behalf of my associates and myself convey, through the columns of this journal, our thanks to all those who sent telegrams and letters.
('8', 113, 3, 10, 270946) I request to be excused for not sending individual replies.
('8', 113, 3, 11, 271006) Moreover, I hope and pray to the Almighty that, should the occasion arise again, the Indians who went to prison this time, as also other Indians, will do what the former did for the sake of Truth and for the sake of our motherland.

('8', 113, 5, 14, 271375) [JOHANNESBURG] I have worked and will continue to work as a passive resister, which means that I must fear no one but God.
('8', 113, 5, 15, 271498) Some persons are threatening to resort to violence if the community agrees to give the ten finger prints.
('8', 113, 5, 16, 271604) I must tell these persons that I myself gave my finger prints twice while in gaol.
('8', 113, 5, 17, 271687) If violence is to be used against anyone, let it be first used against me.
('8', 113, 5, 18, 271762) I will not lodge a complaint with the magistrate on that score.
('8', 113, 5, 19, 271826) Rather, I shall thank the person who assaults me, grateful for the blow from one of my brethren and feel honoured by it.
('8', 113, 5, 20, 271947) The responsibility for whatever has happened is mine as it will be for whatever happens in the future.
('8', 113, 5, 21, 272050) No one therefore but

('8', 114, 1, 2, 272187) myself is to be blamed for any of the things [that have happened].
('8', 114, 1, 3, 272254) I wish not to be proud of being the leader of the community nor do I claim any credit for that; I wish only to remain a servant.
('8', 114, 1, 4, 272383) I shall feel joy in rendering whatever service I can do the community.
('8', 114, 1, 5, 272454) It is my duty to make public the true state of affairs; that is what I have always done.
('8', 114, 1, 6, 272543) If, under the new law, I were asked to take out the register by only signing my name, I would have refused to do so.
('8', 114, 1, 7, 272660) Once the new law is withdrawn, I hold that it will be in keeping with our dignity to take out the register voluntarily.
('8', 114, 1, 8, 272780) Our pledge has been honoured and the demand that we insisted upon has been conceded which means that we shall be treated as men.
('8', 114, 1, 9, 272909) No one else knows about the law as much as I do and can explain it as well as I. I do not say this out of pride; only because whatever explanation I give, will be correct to the best of my judgment.
('8', 114, 1, 10, 273108) I am thoroughly familiar with all that has happened since 1903. There is only one task we have accomplished through the fight, and that is to have prepared the ground.
('8', 114, 1, 11, 273276) What remains now is to construct a building on it.
('8', 114, 1, 12, 273327) We have now to decide what kind of a building we shall construct and how.
('8', 114, 1, 13, 273401) It is not yet settled that digit impressions will have to be given.
('8', 114, 1, 14, 273469) However, it is only through our own free choice that we will give them, if at all.
('8', 114, 1, 15, 273552) I am doing my best in this matter as I said on an earlier occasion as well.
('8', 114, 1, 16, 273628) I wish to repeat that whatever we do now is to be kept private; we must not make a fuss in public about all this.
('8', 114, 1, 17, 273742) We stand to lose to the extent that we do.
('8', 114, 1, 18, 273785) We must behave with the utmost humility.
('8', 114, 1, 19, 273826) The courage we have shown in joining the movement against the Government is bound to be rewarded.
('8', 114, 1, 20, 273924) And we must continue to act with the same courage.
('8', 114, 1, 21, 273975) I am doing nothing for the community for the sake of reward or fame.
('8', 114, 1, 22, 274044) Everything I do is as a matter of duty, and I shall continue to do so in future.
('8', 114, 1, 23, 274125) If anyone wants legal advice, my office is always open.
('8', 114, 1, 24, 274181) And I shall give the best advice I can.
('8', 114, 1, 25, 274221) You may accept or reject it as you think best.
('8', 114, 1, 26, 274268) I am always with the community.
('8', 114, 1, 27, 274300) I have explained the question about the law, but further elucidation will appear in the Opinion, which may be referred to.

('8', 115, 2, 3, 274538) JOHANNESBURG, February 5, 1908
('8', 115, 3, 4, 274569) MY DEAR MAGANLAL, I had intended to write to you in Gujarati, but I cannot.
('8', 115, 3, 5, 274645) I have seen your letter.
('8', 115, 3, 6, 274670) It was good that you sent a full account.
('8', 115, 3, 7, 274712) It was your duty.
('8', 115, 3, 8, 274730) [These] things cannot affect me, at any rate seriously, as they will affect you, for two reasons: (1) because I am [much inured] and sea soned; (2) because being at a distance I can take a proper perspective.
('8', 115, 3, 9, 274939) The discontent in Durban does not affect me or disturb me in the slightest degree.
('8', 115, 3, 10, 275022) I did not expect it in such vehe[mence]; but neither is it unexpected, if you could perceive the difference between the two expressions.
('8', 115, 3, 11, 275159) I am fully prepared for it, for the simple and sole reason that, while I have utilized all the help received and promised, I have never placed unflinching reliance on any such helps.
('8', 115, 3, 12, 275342) At best, I have treated them as so many instruments through which God, other wise Truth, has worked.
('8', 115, 3, 13, 275443) Have I not noticed times without number that particular men have been [faithful] only in so far as it was necessary for them to serve Truth unconsciously [for] not having had it in them they have fallen away as scales do from trees as soon as their protective [function is] finished.
('8', 115, 3, 14, 275727) In so far as you al[low] these events to beat you to the extent [they] have, you have not assimil[ated them] and you have not understood [the chasten]ing effect of suffering.
('8', 115, 3, 15, 275902) What does it matter .
('8', 115, 3, 16, 275924) .to me if even the few who un[derstand] the real struggle were to turn round.
('8', 115, 3, 17, 276002) I not say 2 on the establishment .

('8', 115, 3, 19, 276131) Even then, we [will] continue to do our duty unflinchingly, undismayed, and without being morose.
('8', 115, 3, 20, 276229) That time has not come, but those who are prepared for the worst can always philosophically take the intermediate stages.
('8', 115, 3, 21, 276351) You should, therefore, hear these things and let them pass away from your minds as water from a ducks back.
('8', 115, 3, 22, 276459) I know you do not need replies to several of these questions raised by the people there.
('8', 115, 3, 23, 276548) [There is] not one which I have not cons[idered] which I did not provide for to the [best of] my ability.
('8', 115, 3, 24, 276654) I hope this will [find you all] right.
('8', 115, 3, 25, 276693) I wish I could pay a visit to Phoenix and see you all, but that cannot be yet.

('8', 116, 4, 6, 277249) 68. HUMILITY There is an Indian proverb that the more the mango tree flourishes, the more it droops.
('8', 116, 4, 7, 277350) There can be no gainsaying the fact that Indians in the Transvaal have come out of their struggle with honour, and, what is more, without their sacred resolution having been broken.
('8', 116, 4, 8, 277532) The suffering that they have gone through must be taken as a necessary process of purification.
('8', 116, 4, 9, 277628) The compromise contemplates the ultimate repeal of the Act, which was the soul of the objection.
('8', 116, 4, 10, 277725) The voluntary registration which has been offered often has now been accepted, and the condition stated in the dignified, yet humble, letter written by Messrs Gandhi, Quinn and Naidoo is that the Act is not to apply to those who volun tarily register themselves.
('8', 116, 4, 11, 277988) The Government receive all they wanted in the way of identification, so that each party gets the substance it was striving for.
('8', 116, 4, 12, 278116) Looked at in that light, the compromise reflects credit alike on the Government and on the Indian community.
('8', 116, 4, 13, 278225) The Govern ment have shown their strength in having even at the eleventh hour recognized the necessity of consulting Indian sentiment.
('8', 116, 4, 14, 278360) The much discussed finger prints remain, though in an elastic manner, and their acceptance by the Indian community shows not only its prudence, but it shows that the Indian objection has never centred round finger prints.
('8', 116, 4, 15, 278582) We must decline to call this compromise a victory for Indians.
('8', 116, 4, 16, 278645) That were an abuse of terms, but, if it be at all applicable in this connection, the victory is for Truth.
('8', 116, 4, 17, 278752) Indians have always stated, and rightly so, that this was a religious fight.
('8', 116, 4, 18, 278829) People who only give a superficial meaning to the word religion, have failed to see any in the Indian struggle, but Indians themselves have thought otherwise.
('8', 116, 4, 19, 278988) They undertook it in the name of God, and they have to humble themselvesbefore Him for having received sufficient strength to come through the ordeal.
('8', 117, 0, 1, 279139) 118 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 117, 1, 2, 279181) Moreover, Indians have little reason to glory over the com promise, but every incentive to walk humbly, because the work of a different and higher type has only just commenced.
('8', 117, 1, 3, 279358) The community has, of its own asking, been put upon its trial.
('8', 117, 1, 4, 279421) Instead of the law requi ring it on pain of suffering the penalties, they have incurred a moral and, therefore, a higher obligation by offering the Government every facility for identifying all Indians entitled to reside in the Transvaal.
('8', 117, 1, 5, 279660) It is, therefore, now constructive work, and, whilst the community has proved itself capable of carrying on in an orderly, peaceful and per fectly courteous manner, the necessary work of destruction, it has now to show that it is capable of solid and substantial constructive work.
('8', 117, 1, 6, 279942) When it has proved itself worthy of the confidence reposed in it, the Indian community may have reason to congratulate itself, and will certainly have risen very high indeed in the estimation of all thought ful men.

('8', 117, 2, 9, 280562) Due information will be given with reference to registration in other places, and it is stated that, except in Pretoria and Johannesburg, the receiving of applications will be left in the hands of the magistrates in the different parts.
('8', 117, 2, 10, 280799) The form of registration certificate and the form of application have been considerably changed, in order to suit the new situation.
('8', 117, 2, 11, 280932) Every adult male Indian should present himself for registration, and all those who are entitled to receive the certificate will be registered.
('8', 117, 2, 12, 281075) Roughly, those who are in possession of permits bona fide issued to them, and those who are in possession of old Dutch registration certificates, being their property, and all children who entered the country openly when they were under the age of 16 years will be registered.
('8', 117, 2, 13, 281352) The following may be, to all intents and purposes, laid down as the rule regarding the methods of identification: (a) At the discretion of the Registrar, signatures, that is to say signatures well formed, bearing the impress of the signatory and not a mere tracing of letters, will be accepted in place of finger prints from those who may possess property qualifications, or may be otherwise known as residents of the Transvaal.

('8', 118, 1, 2, 281826) (b) Signatures in place of finger prints will be accepted from those who possess educational qualification sufficient to satisfy the test under the Immigrants Restriction Act.
('8', 118, 1, 3, 282002) (c) Those who have any real or conscientious objections to giving ten finger prints, and who do not fall under either of the above clauses, may be allowed to give thumb prints instead of digit imp ressions.
('8', 118, 1, 4, 282209) Whilst all these are very liberal concessions, in our opinion, it will be more becoming of the Indian community not to take advan tage of them.
('8', 118, 1, 5, 282353) The main point having been secured, we are of opinion that everyone should give digit impressions without the slightest hesitation.
('8', 118, 1, 6, 282485) In any case, the leaders who have a right not to give finger prints should be the first to waive it and offer to give those impres sions, so as to facilitate the workof identification, and make the pro cess easier for the Government.
('8', 118, 1, 7, 282719) We believe that the Indian commu nity will show its real dignity by making as limited a use of the con cession as possible.
('8', 118, 1, 8, 282843) We understand that Messrs Essop Mia, Gandhi, and others who have been closely identified with the struggle, have decided not to claim the concession.

('8', 118, 3, 11, 283039) With an even mind face happiness and unhappiness, gain and loss, victory and defeat, and so join battle, thou son of Prithu; thou shalt incur no sin thereby. 1
('8', 118, 4, 12, 283199) The Transvaal Indians, we believe, have emerged completely vic torious.
('8', 118, 4, 13, 283271) They struggled for 16 months.
('8', 118, 4, 14, 283301) All the sections [of the Indian community] have become united.
('8', 118, 4, 15, 283364) Indians all over South Africa were roused.
('8', 118, 4, 16, 283407) Their pledge about gaol going has been fulfilled.
('8', 118, 4, 17, 283457) And the settlement followed with unexpected speed.
('8', 118, 4, 18, 283508) It is a miracle that the prison doors opened before the term of imprisonment had expired.
('8', 118, 4, 19, 283598) We shall not come across many instances of this kind in world history.
('8', 118, 4, 20, 283669) The Government has placed great confidence in the Indian commu nity and an equally heavy measure of responsibility.
('8', 118, 4, 21, 283785) The demand of the Indian community has been accepted, namely, that the law should not apply to them.
('8', 118, 4, 22, 283886) The words, the law should not apply to them, need to be carefully understood.
('8', 118, 4, 23, 283964) An oath was taken in September 1906 not to submit to the law.
('8', 118, 4, 24, 284026) Submission to the law was the only issue at that time.
('8', 118, 4, 25, 284081) The regulations made under it in July [1907] did

('8', 119, 0, 1, 284157) 120 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 119, 1, 2, 284199) not then exist.
('8', 119, 1, 3, 284215) 1 The Government has now promised not to apply the law to Indians on the condition that the objective of the law should be secured by the Indians themselves acting of their free will, that is, without the compulsion of that law.
('8', 119, 1, 4, 284444) This condition means voluntary registration.
('8', 119, 1, 5, 284489) The Indian community has time and again offered to register on its own.
('8', 119, 1, 6, 284561) The Government has now at last accepted the proposal and agreed not to apply the new law to those who register voluntarily.
('8', 119, 1, 7, 284685) This means that the law will remain valid only for the blacklegs; alternatively there may be another law applicable to all.
('8', 119, 1, 8, 284809) When the movement started, there were quite a few weak minded Indians who argued, The laws of the State are inviolable; It is like running ones head against a wall; It will do if the Government makes a few changes in the law; It is madness to resist the Govern ment and so on.
('8', 119, 1, 9, 285086) Those who argued in this manner showed little faith in Khuda Ishwar, swayed as they were by greed for money or other unworthytemptations.
('8', 119, 1, 10, 285224) The selfsame law is now about to fall apart.
('8', 119, 1, 11, 285269) It has not gone yet, but the Indians who were imprisoned have been released with the assurance that it will go.
('8', 119, 1, 12, 285381) All the newspapers, without an exception, are astonished.
('8', 119, 1, 13, 285439) The whites are dumbfounded and won der how all this came about.
('8', 119, 1, 14, 285503) We consider this a victory for truth.
('8', 119, 1, 15, 285541) We do not claim that every Indian adhered to truth in the course of the struggle.
('8', 119, 1, 16, 285623) Nor do we claim that no one thought of his own interests during the campaign.
('8', 119, 1, 17, 285701) We do, however, assert that this was a fight on behalf of truth, and that most of the leaders fought with scrupulous regard for truth.
('8', 119, 1, 18, 285836) That is why there has been such a wonderful result.
('8', 119, 1, 19, 285888) Truth is God, or God is nothing but Truth.
('8', 119, 1, 20, 285931) We come across this idea in every religion.
('8', 119, 1, 21, 285975) It is a divine law that he who serves that Truththat God will never suffer defeat.
('8', 119, 1, 22, 286058) Some times men of truth appear to have failed, but that is no more than a fleeting appearance.
('8', 119, 1, 23, 286153) In reality they are not defeated.
('8', 119, 1, 24, 286187) When the result is not as we wanted it to be, we tend to think we have failed.
('8', 119, 1, 25, 286266) But that which appears a defeat to us is often but victory itself.
('8', 119, 1, 26, 286333) There are thousands of such instances [in history].
('8', 119, 1, 27, 286385) If, with some measure of truth on our side, we strive for a certain result and fail, the blame does not lie with truth but with us.
('8', 119, 1, 28, 286517) If a particular result does not serve our good, God will not grant it, however much we may desire it.
('8', 119, 1, 29, 286619) That is why we quote above a verse from the Gita, which says that we must fight on, with an equal mind, through happiness and unhappiness, gain and loss.
('8', 119, 1, 30, 286773) If we do so, we shall incur no sin.
('8', 119, 1, 31, 286809) This is a time hono ured solution.
('8', 119, 1, 32, 286844) With that key, we shall be able to open the most unyiel

('8', 120, 1, 3, 287038) He who fights in this manner will fight only in the name of God.
('8', 120, 1, 4, 287103) He will give no thought to success or failure.
('8', 120, 1, 5, 287150) He is pledged only to the great task of serving Truth, doing his duty in the name of God.
('8', 120, 1, 6, 287240) The outcome itself is in the hands of the Lord Almighty.
('8', 120, 1, 7, 287297) If this is a victory for truth, it is also a victory for satyagraha.
('8', 120, 1, 8, 287366) Every Indian should by now be convinced that satyagraha, or passive resistance, is an infallible remedy.
('8', 120, 1, 9, 287471) It can cure the most dangerous of ailments.
('8', 120, 1, 10, 287515) Our success should lead at least to one result, namely, that we make full use of satyagraha.
('8', 120, 1, 11, 287608) Only it should be used on proper occasions, and the people should remain united.
('8', 120, 1, 12, 287689) It must also be realized that there are evils to which satyagraha cannot be applied.
('8', 120, 1, 13, 287774) It can be effective only in situations where we are required to act positi vely.
('8', 120, 1, 14, 287855) For instance, if the Government does not allow us to acquire land, satyagraha will be of no avail.
('8', 120, 1, 15, 287954) If, however, it forbids us from walking along a certain foot path, or asks us to shift to Locations, or seeks to prevent us from carrying on trade, we can resort to satya graha.
('8', 120, 1, 16, 288132) That is, if we are required to do anything which violates our religion or insults our manhood, we can administer the invaluable physic of satyagraha.
('8', 120, 1, 17, 288282) There is one condition, however, to be observed, if the remedy is to be effective: we should be prepared collectively to accept hardships.
('8', 120, 1, 18, 288421) Some persons may well feel that all this is empty talk.
('8', 120, 1, 19, 288477) What victory has there been to talk about?
('8', 120, 1, 20, 288520) Here we are yielding on the question of giving digit impressions.
('8', 120, 1, 21, 288586) I am afraid that those who argue like this do not know the true position.
('8', 120, 1, 22, 288660) This was not a struggle against digit impressions.
('8', 120, 1, 23, 288711) Once the law is gone, there is no harm in our having to give the ten finger prints.
('8', 120, 1, 24, 288795) The giving of finger prints is not in itself a disgraceful thing.
('8', 120, 1, 25, 288861) But under the new law giving anything whatever is objectionable.
('8', 120, 1, 26, 288926) There is no humiliation in polishing a friends shoes as a gesture or of our free will.
('8', 120, 1, 27, 289013) But polishing shoes out of fear, when ordered to do so, would amount to demeaning ourselves as menials.
('8', 120, 1, 28, 289117) In other words, whether a particular thing is good or bad depends on the context.
('8', 120, 1, 29, 289199) We know that there are many Indians who have mistakenly assumed that our campaign is against the giving of ten finger prints.
('8', 120, 1, 30, 289325) But such Indians should realize that there is no humiliation in giving ten finger prints when not compelled by the law.
('8', 120, 1, 31, 289445) Doing so certainly does not amount to a violation of our pledge.
('8', 120, 1, 32, 289510) At the moment of writing it is not finally settled that the digit impressions will be asked for.
('8', 120, 1, 33, 289607) Every effort is being made to ensure that they will not be.
('8', 120, 1, 34, 289667) But it is
('8', 121, 0, 1, 289677) 122 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 121, 1, 2, 289719) our duty to place the matter before the people in the proper pers pective.
('8', 121, 1, 3, 289794) Digit impressions whether or not they are required should not lead to any difficulty.
('8', 121, 1, 4, 289880) It is essential to present a correct idea of the object of this campaign.
('8', 121, 1, 5, 289954) [From Gujarati] Indian Opinion, 8 2 1908
('8', 121, 2, 6, 289995) 71. TO THOSE WHO SUBMITTED TO THE OBNOXIOUS LAW
('8', 121, 3, 7, 290043) We have been describing blacklegs as black faced people.
('8', 121, 3, 8, 290100) That was done deliberately and without anger.
('8', 121, 3, 9, 290146) It was our duty to do so.
('8', 121, 3, 10, 290172) We did not, however, use that description with any ill will, only we felt grieved because of our love for them.
('8', 121, 3, 11, 290284) The time to call anyone a black faced person is now over.
('8', 121, 3, 12, 290342) It was necessary to draw public attention to their conduct by way of warning.
('8', 121, 3, 13, 290420) Now that the struggle is at an end, it will be improper to use any such description.
('8', 121, 3, 14, 290505) We shall therefore stop writing in that manner and also advise the people who remained free not to feel angry with those who submitted to the outrageous law, and, forgetting their lapse, to put an end to the estrangement that has grown.
('8', 121, 3, 15, 290742) They are brothers of other Indians, belong to the same land and have the same blood as other Indians have.
('8', 121, 3, 16, 290849) [A block of] water cannot be cloven as under by the stroke of a stick; similarly we cannot be separated from one another.
('8', 121, 3, 17, 290971) To those who accepted the outrageous law, we would suggest that they admit their mistake in all humility and be reconciled with the community.
('8', 121, 3, 18, 291114) They should pray to God to forgive them their mistake, and should such an occasion recur, act with strength.
('8', 121, 3, 19, 291223) The suggestion about building a Federation Hall has been revived.
('8', 121, 3, 20, 291289) If such a hall is built, these persons can offer much help.
('8', 121, 3, 21, 291349) While the whole community has suffered hardships and heavy losses, those who submitted to the outrageous law have made money.
('8', 121, 3, 22, 291475) In any case, they submitted to the law for the sake of money.
('8', 121, 3, 23, 291537) It is therefore only proper that they should offer a large and adequate subscription towards the cost of the Federation Hall.
('8', 121, 3, 24, 291663) This suggestion of ours is not to be forced on them.
('8', 121, 3, 25, 291716) That will not bring about any sincere repentance.
('8', 121, 3, 26, 291766) Their donation will have grace only if they offer it with sincere concern for the benefit of the community or the country.
('8', 121, 3, 27, 291889) We hope that the Memons who behaved with courage and upheld the honour of the community and the Memons from outside the Transvaal will explain to others who have submitted to the law what their duty is; and similarly persons belon ging to the other communities who took out the registers [under the
('8', 122, 0, 1, 292188) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 123
('8', 122, 1, 2, 292233) compulsion of the law] should also be approached by members of their respective communities as also by other Indians.
('8', 122, 2, 3, 292351) [From Gujarati] Indian Opinion, 8 2 1908
('8', 122, 3, 4, 292392) 72. RITCHS GREAT ACHIEVEMENT It is impossible to evaluate Mr. Ritchs services, but it can be asserted that we would not have been successful but for his help and that of others.
('8', 122, 3, 5, 292570) We suggest that the Indian community should adequa tely express its appreciation of his work.
('8', 122, 3, 6, 292664) Indeed it is the duty of the community to do so.
('8', 122, 3, 7, 292713) At the present moment Mr. Ritchs duty is really by Mrs. Ritchs bedside.
('8', 122, 3, 8, 292785) He has instead remained at his post without a moments respite.
('8', 122, 3, 9, 292848) The value of such self sacrifice cannot be exag gerated.
('8', 122, 3, 10, 292905) Mr. Ritch being a poor person, we think the best way would be to offer him a cash present.
('8', 122, 4, 11, 292996) [From Gujarati] Indian Opinion, 8 2 1908
('8', 122, 5, 12, 293037) 73. WHY NOT IN GOLDEN LETTERS?
('8', 122, 6, 13, 293068) We earlier commented on a letter from Rasik saying that, when Indians returned from their pilgrimage to the gaol palace and success had been won, we would think of printing Indian Opinion in golden letters.
('8', 122, 6, 14, 293275) Now the question has been raised again by some of our readers, [but] we do not think that our victory is yet complete.
('8', 122, 6, 15, 293394) From one point of view, of course, it has been a real victory.
('8', 122, 6, 16, 293457) That is, the conditions of satyagraha have been fulfilled, the gaol gates have opened and an agreement has been reached for registration outside the framework of the law, which, if carried out, would mean the end of the law.
('8', 122, 6, 17, 293682) Two things therefore remain for the future.
('8', 122, 6, 18, 293726) We need not be unduly flattered by the fact that the Government has trusted us; the real victory will be ours when Indians prove themselves worthy of the trust.
('8', 122, 6, 19, 293887) We have done good spade work, namely, the clearing of the ground and the digging for the foundations.
('8', 122, 6, 20, 293989) It remains to be seen what kind of super structure we can build.
('8', 122, 6, 21, 294054) The Government has placed in our hands the key to the repeal of the law.
('8', 122, 6, 22, 294127) We shall have achieved complete success when we use that key and when the law has in fact been repealed.
('8', 122, 6, 23, 294232) It is only now that we are faced with the really difficult work.
('8', 122, 6, 24, 294297) It will call for strenuous effort.
('8', 122, 6, 25, 294332) There will be need for greater patience and the utmost honesty.
('8', 122, 6, 26, 294396) Let us see whether or not we are capable of these.
('8', 122, 6, 27, 294447) Some Indians ask whether the Government may
('8', 123, 0, 1, 294491) 124 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 123, 1, 2, 294533) not in spite of all refuse to repeal the law even after we have registered ourselves voluntarily.
('8', 123, 1, 3, 294631) We think this doubt needless.
('8', 123, 1, 4, 294661) For, what if Indians do not honour their word?
('8', 123, 1, 5, 294708) That is in fact the more important question to ask.
('8', 123, 1, 6, 294760) We have to go through voluntary registration in the manner prescribed by the rules.
('8', 123, 1, 7, 294844) Everyone should think, not of self interest, but the interests of the community as a whole, and register as quickly as possible.
('8', 123, 1, 8, 294973) Furthermore, only those who are really entitled to do so should take out registers.
('8', 123, 1, 9, 295057) No one should attempt to gain any illegitimate advantage [out of the situation].
('8', 123, 1, 10, 295138) We sincerely wish to see that no Indian is proved dishonest and that all the appli cations for registration are passed without exception.
('8', 123, 1, 11, 295276) The glorious success that Indians will achieve then, the hosts of heaven will come down to watch.
('8', 123, 1, 12, 295374) The law will then automatically stand cancelled, and that will be the time to accept the suggestion for printing Indian Opinion in golden letters.

('8', 123, 8, 21, 296043) The Colonial Secretary instructs me to say that he appreciates the wisdom of the step you have taken in response to his repeated public declarations that if the Asiatics in the Transvaal volunteer to register in a body an opportunity for registration should be given them.

('8', 124, 1, 3, 297093) In the meantime the penalties of the Act will not be enforced against those who do register, and the Colonial Secretary accepts your assurance that you will use your influence with your compatriots to make this registration effective and final.

('8', 124, 4, 7, 297503) It was due to the efforts of Mr. Cartwright, editor of The Transvaal Leader [that these letters were exchanged].
('8', 124, 4, 8, 297616) Mr. Cartwright has himself suffered imprisonment for reasons of conscience.
('8', 124, 4, 9, 297692) That is why he has since remained indefatigable in his support of the Indian cause.
('8', 124, 4, 10, 297776) He obtained special permission from the Governmentto meet Mr. Gandhi in gaol and visited him twice.
('8', 124, 4, 11, 297876) The first meeting took place on Tuesday, the 21st.
('8', 124, 4, 12, 297927) In the course of that meeting it was agreed between the two that the new law should be repealed during the following session of Parliament and that the Indian community should immediately take out registers voluntarily.
('8', 124, 4, 13, 298147) The agreement was also put down in writing.
('8', 124, 4, 14, 298191) Mr. Cart wright then met the leaders of the Progressive Party.
('8', 124, 4, 15, 298254) While accepting the suggestion, they asked that the Indians should write a letter from gaol volunteering to register.
('8', 124, 4, 16, 298372) Mr. Cartwright himself drafted a letter to that effect and brought it to gaol on the 28th.
('8', 124, 4, 17, 298463) 1 The draft petition did not, however, say categorically that the new law would not apply to those who registered voluntarily, and it was moreover on behalf of the Indians alone.
('8', 124, 4, 18, 298642) It did not furthermore safeguard the interests of those who are outside the Transvaal at present, and included children under the age of sixteen [for purposes of voluntary registration].
('8', 124, 4, 19, 298829) Mr. Gan dhi therefore proposed changes on both these points.
('8', 124, 4, 20, 298890) On Mr. Cart wright appearing hesitant, Mr. Gandhi told him that, if these were not accepted, Indians would prefer to continue in gaol.
('8', 124, 4, 21, 299025) Visibly touched, Mr. Cartwright said, Well, you must make whatever changes you want.
('8', 124, 4, 22, 299110) You are fighting for truth.
('8', 124, 4, 23, 299138) The changes you propose are reason able, and necessary for your self respect.
('8', 124, 4, 24, 299216) If Mr. Smuts does not accept
('8', 124, 5, 25, 299245) Satyagraha in South Africa, Ch. XXI, where Gandhiji says that the compromise letter was either drafted or approved of by General Smuts.
('8', 125, 0, 1, 299381) 126 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 125, 1, 2, 299423) them, I shall myself oppose him, and I also hope to turn the Progres sive Party against him. After these changes had been made, Mr. Quinn and Mr. Naidoo, who had done excellent work [for the cam paign], were called in.
('8', 125, 1, 3, 299642) They both approved the letter 1 and signed it.
('8', 125, 1, 4, 299689) It was signed at 12 30 p.m.
('8', 125, 1, 5, 299717) Mr. Cartwright left with the letter for Pre toria by the 2 30 train on the same day.
('8', 125, 1, 6, 299802) At five in the afternoon he rang up to say that General Smuts had accepted [the terms of] the letter.
('8', 125, 1, 7, 299904) He had asked for permission to alter one word, which was given.
('8', 125, 1, 8, 299968) It seemed obvious then that Indians would be released soon.
('8', 125, 2, 9, 300028) OTHER CONDITIONS
('8', 125, 3, 10, 300045) There are some things that can be put down in writing, and for others one has to rely on oral understanding.
('8', 125, 3, 11, 300154) That is what has happened in regard to this compromise.
('8', 125, 3, 12, 300210) It was conveyed to the Government through Mr. Cartwright that efforts should be made to reinstate all the Indians who had been relieved of their posts in the Government and that the Indian community should be consulted about the form of the new registration certificate.
('8', 125, 3, 13, 300481) Mr. Cartwright informed us over the telephone that General Smuts would not commit himself on the question of [reinstating] the Government servants but that he had agreed to do his best; as for the form of the register, he agreed to consult [the Indian community].
('8', 125, 3, 14, 300745) The proposed registration would not be under the law, and the Indian community would also be consulted as to how it should be legalized.
('8', 125, 4, 15, 300882) VISIT TO PRETORIA
('8', 125, 5, 16, 300900) On Thursday, the 30th, the Governor of the prison received an order to arrange for Mr. Gandhi to be taken to Pretoria.
('8', 125, 5, 17, 301019) He was accordingly escorted to Pretoria by Superintendent Vernon.
('8', 125, 5, 18, 301085) The Government had made the necessary arrangement for his meal on the way.
('8', 125, 5, 19, 301160) Everything was to be confidential.
('8', 125, 5, 20, 301195) The train was therefore stopped before it actually reached Pretoria for Mr. Gandhi to alight lest he should be noticed by the ever vigilant pickets at Pretoria.
('8', 125, 5, 21, 301356) Mr. Gandhi went to the Colonial Office, accompanied by Mr. Lane and Superintendent Bates.
('8', 125, 5, 22, 301446) It should be remembered that he was still a prisoner.
('8', 125, 5, 23, 301500) The meeting with General Smuts took place exactly at 12 noon.
('8', 125, 5, 24, 301562) General Smuts said: Personally I have nothing against the Indian community.
('8', 125, 5, 25, 301638) The demands you have made in your letter are rather excessive, but the Government proposes to accept them.
('8', 125, 5, 26, 301745) What the form of the registration certificate should be and how the registration should be legalized will be considered later.
('8', 125, 5, 27, 301872) Of course, this registration will be outside the new law.
('8', 125, 5, 28, 301930) But I suggest that your
('8', 125, 6, 29, 301954) 1 Vide Letter to Colonial Secretary, 28 1 1908
('8', 126, 0, 1, 302001) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 127
('8', 126, 1, 2, 302046) people do not discuss this matter in public.
('8', 126, 1, 3, 302091) If you do, you yourself will stand to lose.
('8', 126, 1, 4, 302135) For my people will turn against me. When Mr. Gandhi referred to the question of finger impressions, he said: If finger impressions are found necessary, you will have to give them.
('8', 126, 1, 5, 302315) You have already said that your resistance is not directed against these.
('8', 126, 1, 6, 302389) However, of this too, we shall talk later. He then added: My second suggestion is that you should not harass the blacklegs. Mr. Gandhi replied: It should not be necessary for you to make any recommen dation on this point.
('8', 126, 1, 7, 302611) We are convinced that they have made a mistake; however, they are our brethren, our own flesh and blood.
('8', 126, 1, 8, 302716) It cannot be the wish of any decent Indian to harass them.
('8', 126, 1, 9, 302775) [On the contrary] it will be the duty of every thoughtful Indian to restrain those who are over enthusiastic in this regard. There were other things that were discussed besides, but these need not be reported here.
('8', 126, 1, 10, 302990) A meeting of the Cabinet was then called, and the draft reply reproduced above in translation was given to Mr. Gandhi after it had been approved by the Cabinet, and Mr. Gandhi was then set free.
('8', 126, 2, 11, 303185) IMPLICATION
('8', 126, 3, 12, 303197) This compromise implies that the offer of voluntary registration made by the Indian community has been accepted in full.
('8', 126, 3, 13, 303318) This registration will not be under the law; it will be outside that law, which will therefore not apply to such registration.
('8', 126, 3, 14, 303445) There is no need to withdraw the Gazette notice regarding the registration for, since the time limit is over, the notice is already invalid.
('8', 126, 4, 15, 303586) WHAT ABOUT LICENCES?
('8', 126, 5, 16, 303607) The notice about licences stands, and it has therefore been agreed that, except the blacklegs, all Indians may carry on trade without licences for the time being.
('8', 126, 5, 17, 303770) They will get licences after the new registration is legalized, and meanwhile no one will be prosecuted for trading without a licence.
('8', 126, 6, 18, 303905) WHAT ABOUT FINGER IMPRESSIONS?
('8', 126, 7, 19, 303936) Ten impressions if you give, humbled will your manhood be. Will Mr. Gandhi, forgetting the songs that were then sung, now advise the giving of finger impressions?
('8', 126, 7, 20, 304099) Mr. Gandhi has answered this, and repeats the reply, Yes, I do give such advice.
('8', 126, 7, 21, 304180) Our campaign is not against finger prints but against the law.
('8', 126, 7, 22, 304243) It is enough that we will not have to submit to the law.
('8', 126, 7, 23, 304300) It will be disgraceful to give signatures under the law, but as long as we do not submit to it, we may give fingerprints, and more, without disgrace.
('8', 126, 7, 24, 304450) The song above was about the law.
('8', 126, 7, 25, 304484) Finger impressions and suchlike were only symbols of that
('8', 127, 0, 1, 304542) 128 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 127, 1, 2, 304584) A prisoner is recognized by the dress he wears.
('8', 127, 1, 3, 304632) In a ditty about that prisoner we may describe his shirt; but the same dress, donned by a gentleman because he chooses to or by an Englishman at a fancy dress ball, does not make either of them a prisoner. Mr. Gandhi and other Indians deserve credit for having given 18 digit impressions while in gaol.
('8', 127, 1, 4, 304935) They did no wrong in giving them.
('8', 127, 1, 5, 304969) In fact, it would have been wrong of them to have refused to give them.
('8', 127, 1, 6, 305041) The paper on which the impressions were given, if available, would be worth framing.
('8', 127, 1, 7, 305126) For going to gaol amounted to opening the door for the eventual freedom of Indians.
('8', 127, 1, 8, 305210) Whatever happened in gaol should therefore be welcomed, if it was otherwise reasonable.
('8', 127, 1, 9, 305298) A silken cord can be used to hang a man.
('8', 127, 1, 10, 305339) When it is so used it will become an object of fear.
('8', 127, 1, 11, 305392) But the same cord can be used for stringing a necklace, and then it becomes an ornament.
('8', 127, 1, 12, 305481) It is not yet finally settled that ten finger prints will have to be given.
('8', 127, 1, 13, 305557) The matter is still under discussion.
('8', 127, 1, 14, 305595) If, however, we are required to give them in return for the repeal of the law, it would be childish to fight against the provision.
('8', 127, 1, 15, 305727) It would be like running after a fire fly in preference to the sun.
('8', 127, 1, 16, 305795) Moreover, [the system of] ten finger prints has now been intro duced for the whites also under the immigration law, and one cannot stress the point.
('8', 127, 1, 17, 305944) It should normally have been needless to go into all this.
('8', 127, 1, 18, 306003) But then the matter is being discussed by several persons.
('8', 127, 1, 19, 306062) Hence these detailed explanations.
('8', 127, 2, 20, 306097) EDUCATED PERSONS AND PERSONS OF STANDING
('8', 127, 3, 21, 306138) The discretion vested in officials to accept signatures by educated persons and persons of standing, such as businessmen, is an additional point about [this system of] voluntary registration.
('8', 127, 3, 22, 306330) This was not added at Mr. Gandhis instance, but was included in the draft put before him.
('8', 127, 3, 23, 306420) As it was not considered desirable to forgo this [benefit], it was allowed to remain.
('8', 127, 3, 24, 306506) It appears reasonable that educated persons should be allowed to sign their names [for purposes of identification]; because the decision as to who is educated cannot be made at the discretion of the official.
('8', 127, 3, 25, 306715) But allowing a man of standing to sign, even if he is uneducated, is quite improper.
('8', 127, 3, 26, 306800) The fact that the decision as to who is a man.
('8', 127, 3, 27, 306847) of standing will be made by the official carries with it a suggestion of slavery.
('8', 127, 3, 28, 306929) I therefore advise people not to avail themselves of this concession.
('8', 127, 3, 29, 306999) Whatever we get as a matter of right is welcome, but it is wrong to accept anything as a favour.
('8', 127, 3, 30, 307096) I do not mean to say
('8', 128, 0, 1, 307117) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 129
('8', 128, 1, 2, 307162) that there should be no distinction between good and bad, between the poor and the rich, but such distinctions should not be left to the discretion of an official.
('8', 128, 2, 3, 307326) THE END
('8', 128, 3, 4, 307334) On leaving the Colonial Office, Mr. Gandhi was allowed to go to Johannesburg.
('8', 128, 3, 5, 307412) The watchful pickets, having come to know of this, had surrounded the Colonial Office.
('8', 128, 3, 6, 307499) They were told by Superintendent Bates that Mr. Gandhi had left.
('8', 128, 3, 7, 307564) But they refused to believe that Mr. Gandhi could have left without their knowledge, for they had been guarding all the exits.
('8', 128, 3, 8, 307691) And thus it happened that Mr. Gandhi met the pickets as soon as he came out.
('8', 128, 3, 9, 307768) He informed them that every Indian would be set free on Friday and asked them to convey the information to the others.
('8', 128, 4, 10, 307887) MIDNIGHT MEETING
('8', 128, 5, 11, 307904) Mr. Abdulla sent a telegram to Mr. Essop Mia asking him and Mr. Polak to receive Mr. Gandhi who was arriving at Park Station by the last train.
('8', 128, 5, 12, 308048) Only Mr. Essop Mia and Mr. Aswat were there to receive him, most of the other Indians having gone to the Indian mosque.
('8', 128, 5, 13, 308168) A meeting was held in the precincts at midnight attended by about a thousand people.
('8', 128, 5, 14, 308253) Mr. Gandhi told them to go about their work quietly without noisy demonstrations or processions.
('8', 128, 5, 15, 308350) The reporter of the Leader, who was present, promised not to publish a report of the meeting.
('8', 128, 5, 16, 308444) Everyone agreed that they were only concerned with the result, and that there was no need for any celebrations.
('8', 128, 5, 17, 308556) People felt extremely happy.
('8', 128, 6, 18, 308585) PRISON GATES OPEN
('8', 128, 7, 19, 308603) The prison gates opened at 12 noon on Friday.
('8', 128, 7, 20, 308649) All over the Transvaal, Indians who had been arrested in connection with the law or for carrying on trade without licences have been released.
('8', 128, 7, 21, 308792) Almost all that happened was reported in the newspapers.
('8', 128, 7, 22, 308849) Everyone was sur prised and the whites, too, were happy.
('8', 128, 7, 23, 308906) Telegrams were sent to the Association congratulating the [released] prisoners.
('8', 128, 7, 24, 308986) There must have been more than a hundred of them.
('8', 128, 7, 25, 309036) There is no need to reproduce their names here.
('8', 128, 7, 26, 309084) In any case, there is hardly any space for them.
('8', 128, 7, 27, 309133) These telegrams included one each from Porbandar, Aden and Eng land.
('8', 128, 7, 28, 309202) Some of these were from whites, and a large number of them called in person at the Office [of the Association] to offer congratu

('8', 129, 2, 3, 309407) CONSENT OF PROGRESSIVE PARTY
('8', 129, 3, 4, 309436) Before accepting this compromise, Mr. Smuts had obtained the consent of the Progressive Party.
('8', 129, 3, 5, 309531) He wrote the following letter 1 to Sir George Farrar 2 on the 27th:
('8', 129, 4, 6, 309599) DEAR SIR GEORGE FARRAR,
('8', 129, 5, 7, 309623) Will you kindly consult your friends to see whether there would be any objection to registration being re opened for Asiatics and the chance being given them to register voluntarily, as they desire to do, and to dispense with finger prints in the case of educated or well known Indians?
('8', 129, 5, 8, 309910) It is probable that Parliamentary ratification of such registration will have to take place, and in the meantime the penalties under the Act will not be enforced against those who register voluntarily.
('8', 129, 5, 9, 310112) I understand that Asiatics may be willing to make such an offer to Government, and before closing with it we should like to have your concurrence in so doing.
('8', 129, 6, 10, 310271) Yours sincerely, J. C. SMUTS In reply, Sir George Farrar wrote on the 30th as follows: 3
('8', 129, 7, 11, 310360) DEAR MR. SMUTS, I am in receipt of your letter of January 27, and have communicated its contents to my friends.
('8', 129, 7, 12, 310472) From it we extract certain questions or suggestions, which I append together with our replies.
('8', 129, 8, 13, 310567) QUESTION NO.
('8', 129, 8, 14, 310580) 1: Is there any objection to Registration being re opened for Asiatics and the chance being given them to register voluntarily as they desire to do?
('8', 129, 9, 15, 310729) ANSWER: No, provided time is limited.
('8', 129, 10, 16, 310767) QUESTION NO.
('8', 129, 10, 17, 310780) 2: Is there any objection to dispense with finger prints in the case of educated or well known Indians?
('8', 129, 11, 18, 310884) ANSWER: No, provided that other adequate evidence of identity be forth coming.
('8', 129, 12, 19, 310963) QUESTION NO.
('8', 129, 12, 20, 310976) 3: Is there any objection to the penalties not being enforced in the meantime against those who voluntarily register?
('8', 129, 13, 21, 311094) 1 Both the letter and the reply are reproduced from the English section of Indian Opinion, 8 2 1908. 2 Sir George Herbert Farrar (1859 1915); Chairman, East Rand Proprietary Mines; Member of the Transvaal Legislative Council both before and after Responsible Government 3 Both the letter and the reply are reproduced from the English section of Indian Opinion, 8 2 1908.
('8', 130, 0, 1, 311465) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 131
('8', 130, 1, 2, 311510) ANSWER: NO.
('8', 130, 2, 3, 311522) Am I to understand from the concluding sentence of your letter that the Government do not intend to make the above concessions unless they are satisfied that the Asiatic community is prepared to accept the new position?
('8', 130, 3, 4, 311742) I desire to make our position in this matter perfectly clear.
('8', 130, 4, 5, 311804) We agreed to the law and adhere to it, and its objects must be secured.
('8', 130, 4, 6, 311876) We would, however, point out that as the present regulations were not submi tted to us before promulgation the Government must accept all responsibility in regard to them.
('8', 130, 5, 7, 312048) We feel it essential to success that the law be administered with the least possible friction, and as far as possible, with due consideration for the responsibilities and difficulties of the Imperial Government.
('8', 130, 5, 8, 312260) Believe me, Yours sincerely, GEORGE FARRAR
('8', 130, 6, 9, 312303) MEANING OF THESE LETTERS
('8', 130, 7, 10, 312328) These letters show that the Progressive Party is not opposed to us.
('8', 130, 7, 11, 312396) If one argues that some of these letters do not say categorically that the new law would be repealed or that it would not apply to those who volunteer to take out registers, one would not be wholly wrong.
('8', 130, 7, 12, 312601) But then the letters have been so drafted as not to shock the whites.
('8', 130, 7, 13, 312671) However, the question has been raised as to what would happen if the Government were to play foul and retain the law in its present form.
('8', 130, 7, 14, 312809) The question is easily answered.
('8', 130, 7, 15, 312842) It is obvious that we are not taking out new registers under the law.
('8', 130, 7, 16, 312912) We shall not therefore be bound by it in any way if the Government does not repeal it.
('8', 130, 7, 17, 312999) And if it is not repealed, we shall fight afresh, and the strength that we shall have gained over these three months will stand us in good stead.
('8', 130, 7, 18, 313145) Besides, the Government will be further disgraced, and in that measure ourcase will gain in strength.
('8', 130, 7, 19, 313247) This is the marvellous beauty of voluntary registration and satyagraha; the initiative rests with us instead of with the Government.
('8', 130, 8, 20, 313380) COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING
('8', 130, 9, 21, 313403) After the foregoing account of the compromise had been written, there took place another meeting with General Smuts at which all points were satisfactorily settled.
('8', 130, 9, 22, 313568) 1. If the Indian community takes out registers voluntarily, the new law will be repealed.
('8', 130, 9, 23, 313658) 2. Voluntary registration will be legalized by a new Bill.
('8', 130, 9, 24, 313717) 3. Voluntary registration will not apply to children under sixteen years of age.
('8', 131, 0, 1, 313798) 132 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 131, 1, 2, 313840) 4. There will be new forms of application for voluntary regi stration and for registration certificates.
('8', 131, 1, 3, 313945) The register will mention the names of husband, wife and children and their respective ages.
('8', 131, 1, 4, 314038) In the application form for voluntary registration the name of the mother need not be mentioned but those of children and minors will be necessary.
('8', 131, 1, 5, 314186) Children under sixteen years of age will accompany their parents [to the Registration Office] if they can, so that their ages and facial marks of identification can be noted down.
('8', 131, 1, 6, 314366) Those whose children are outside the Transvaal need only furnish the name and age of each.
('8', 131, 1, 7, 314457) If parents ask for separate registers also for their children under sixteen years of age, these will be granted.
('8', 131, 1, 8, 314570) It should be remem bered therefore that children who are in the Transvaal must accom pany their parents, if they possibly can, when the latter go to apply for registers.
('8', 131, 2, 9, 314740) CONCERNING FINGER PRINTS
('8', 131, 3, 10, 314765) (i) Those who know English well will not be required to give either finger prints or thumb impressions.
('8', 131, 3, 11, 314869) (ii) Men of standing and those who own property can be exempted from the giving of finger prints or thumb impressions.
('8', 131, 3, 12, 314988) (iii) Those who strongly object [on grounds of conscience] to giving ten finger prints will be allowed to give thumb impressions.
('8', 131, 3, 13, 315118) (iv) The rest will have to give the ten finger impressions.
('8', 131, 3, 14, 315178) These concessions appear satisfactory.
('8', 131, 3, 15, 315217) To ask for more will seem unworthy of the Indian community.
('8', 131, 3, 16, 315277) Always the respect that a man enjoys depends on his self restraint.
('8', 131, 3, 17, 315345) Even if a thoughtless demand is conceded, it would be better not to accept the concession.
('8', 131, 3, 18, 315436) I therefore advise every Indian not to avail himself of the exemption allowed on grounds of education or ownership of property.
('8', 131, 3, 19, 315564) Within reasonable limits, whatever we do under [this scheme of] voluntary registration will be a sign of our goodness rather than of disgrace.
('8', 131, 3, 20, 315707) For instance, we will be helping the Government to ensure identification of Indians; we will be giving all the requisite information and more.
('8', 131, 3, 21, 315850) We can be sure that by doing so, we shall rise in the esteem of others.
('8', 131, 3, 22, 315922) That being so, Mr. Essop Mia, Mr. Gandhi and other satyagrahis have decided to give digit impressions.
('8', 131, 3, 23, 316025) By doing so they will not forfeit their rights; a right can be kept in reserve.
('8', 131, 3, 24, 316105) There are rights which, if not enjoyed, add grace like jewellery, but prove harmful when exer cised.
('8', 131, 3, 25, 316206) A perfect analogy occurs to me, which I mention here to explain the object of our struggle.
('8', 131, 3, 26, 316298) The secret of the law, that is, its ess ence, can be described as its soul.
('8', 131, 3, 27, 316374) The regulations prescribing finger prints, etc., can be compared to its body.
('8', 131, 3, 28, 316452) The soul of the law being
('8', 132, 0, 1, 316478) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 133
('8', 132, 1, 2, 316523) evil, we have been struggling for months to destroy it.
('8', 132, 1, 3, 316579) We have succe eded in achieving that result.
('8', 132, 1, 4, 316624) That the body survives does not concern us.
('8', 132, 1, 5, 316668) If the same body be dwelt in by a good soul instead of an evil one, we shall not oppose it.
('8', 132, 1, 6, 316760) Now that the body is to be inhabited by a good soul in the form of voluntary registration, we shall have no quarrel with the body.
('8', 132, 1, 7, 316891) More, we shall even honour that body.
('8', 132, 1, 8, 316929) The writer (of this article) means this comparison seriously.
('8', 132, 1, 9, 316991) This analogy leads to other thoughts besides.
('8', 132, 1, 10, 317037) By further elaborating it we can prove beyond doubt that ours was in fact a holy and religious movement, and a thoughtful person will easily see that we have achieved full success with unexpected speed.
('8', 132, 2, 11, 317240) WHO CAN BE REGISTERD?
('8', 132, 3, 12, 317262) (i) Those who possess valid permits, that is, those whose permits bear their own thumb impressions.
('8', 132, 3, 13, 317362) (ii) Those who were in the Transvaal on May 31, 1902, whether or not they hold permits.
('8', 132, 3, 14, 317450) (iii) Those who hold the Dutch Register obtained by payment of the 3 tax and who reside at present in the Transvaal.
('8', 132, 3, 15, 317567) (iv) All children who entered the country lawfully when they were under the age of sixteen.
('8', 132, 3, 16, 317659) Persons possessing proofs in respect of these will find no difficulty in obtaining voluntary registers.
('8', 132, 3, 17, 317763) WARNING I have just read two letters published in The Star which are very critical of the Government.
('8', 132, 3, 18, 317865) One of them is by one Phillip Hammond.He says that the Government has yielded to the Indian community on every point, and therefore Mr. Smuts has no claim to be called a strong man.
('8', 132, 3, 19, 318047) Mr. Hammond believes that Indians ought to have been kept in gaol long enough [to break down their resistance].
('8', 132, 3, 20, 318159) The other person, a white named Mr. Hyman Levy, claims that he cast his vote for candidates from Mr. Smuts party.
('8', 132, 3, 21, 318273) Angered by the settlement of the Indian question, he has criticized Mr. Smuts in very strong language.
('8', 132, 3, 22, 318376) These letters suggest that, when Parliament meets, Mr. Smuts will find himself in an awkward position.
('8', 132, 3, 23, 318479) It would be well for the Indian community to give careful thought to all this and go through the registration as quickly as possible in order to convince everyone that we are playing the game.
('8', 132, 3, 24, 318672) What the condition of the community will be in future depends on what they do during the ensuing three months.
('8', 132, 3, 25, 318783) I therefore hope that every Indian will think of the interests of the community as a whole and not only of his own.
('8', 132, 3, 26, 318899) WHEN WILL OFFICE OPEN?
('8', 132, 3, 27, 318922) An office will be opened for voluntary registration on Monday
('8', 133, 0, 1, 318984) 134 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 133, 1, 2, 319026) next in Old Church in Von Brandis Square.
('8', 133, 1, 3, 319068) Those who want to take out registers voluntarily should present themselves there with the utmost despatch.
('8', 133, 1, 4, 319175) It is our duty to finish this operation with speed.
('8', 133, 1, 5, 319227) It has been arranged that there would be no Gazette notice about this, since it was thought that that would be more in keeping with our dignity.
('8', 133, 1, 6, 319372) It is likely that in all the towns except Pretoria registration will be carried out through magistrates.
('8', 133, 1, 7, 319477) We have been given three months, but it will be better if we finish it within a month and a half.
('8', 133, 2, 8, 319575) SHOWER OF TELEGRAMS
('8', 133, 3, 9, 319595) There has been a veritable shower of telegrams about the release of prisoners.
('8', 133, 3, 10, 319674) Telegrams have been received from every part of South Africa.
('8', 133, 3, 11, 319736) In all, 150 of them appear to have been received.
('8', 133, 3, 12, 319786) On Friday and Saturday, it was observed that the messenger came with a telegram every five minutes.
('8', 133, 3, 13, 319886) Telegrams also arrived from Aden and India: from Mr. Kekobad at Aden, from Mr. Hajee Ismail Zaveri at Porbandar, and from the Bombay Presidency Association under the signature of Sir Pherozeshah Mehta.
('8', 133, 3, 14, 320088) Sir Pherozeshah has sent a long telegram, offering his warmest congratulations to the community and expres sing admiration of its patience, courage and capacity for self sacrifice.
('8', 133, 4, 15, 320269) HELP FROM WHITES
('8', 133, 5, 16, 320286) The help received from whites in the Transvaal campaign has been beyond all expectations.
('8', 133, 5, 17, 320376) Valuable help was given by prominent whites, such as Mr. Cartwright, Mr. David Pollock, Mr. Phillips 1, Mr. Doke 2 and Mr. Stent, editor of Pretoria News.
('8', 133, 5, 18, 320531) Some of them were prepared to go with us to the very end.
('8', 133, 5, 19, 320589) There were hundreds of other whites who wanted to help, though we did not hear anything of them.
('8', 133, 5, 20, 320686) The increased support for our cause in England shows that there were persons in that country also, who were prepared to fight for truth.
('8', 133, 5, 21, 320823) The Indian community must bear this in mind and give up its anger aga inst the whites.
('8', 133, 5, 22, 320910) We are often thoughtless enough to say that the whites can have nothing good in them.
('8', 133, 5, 23, 320996) But this is patent folly.

('8', 134, 2, 3, 321626) FEDERATION HALL
('8', 134, 3, 4, 321642) A meeting of the [British Indian] Association was held on Wednes day and it was resolved to raise a fund for meeting the cost of the Federation Hall and for other expenditure.
('8', 134, 3, 5, 321818) It was decided to print tickets of ten shillings each and to request everyone to contribute at least that much.
('8', 134, 3, 6, 321930) Those who can afford it should of course give more.
('8', 134, 3, 7, 321982) I shall write of this at greater length next week.
('8', 134, 3, 8, 322033) I hope that every one will help as best he can.
('8', 134, 4, 9, 322081) CARTOON ON VICTORY
('8', 134, 5, 10, 322100) In our issue of the 11th, we reproduced a cartoon from the Sunday Times representing the Transvaal Government as a steam roller which was up against an elephantthe Indian community.
('8', 134, 5, 11, 322282) The paper has now published a sequel showing the wrecked steam roller, and General Smuts, lying on the ground amidst the ruins of his chair, miserable, looking unhappily at the elephant.
('8', 134, 5, 12, 322469) He is wearing a con victs cap.
('8', 134, 5, 13, 322500) The elephant seems pleased with himself as he surveys the wreckage and, with his trunk raised to General Smuts, inquires, Everybody happy? Mr. Gandhi, as mahout, has his digits extendedfan wise at the extremity of his nose, as much as to ask General Smuts, So you have had a taste of digit impressions? Underneath the cartoon is the caption: Picture of Colonial Secretary Receiving Mr. Gandhis Digit impressions.

('8', 134, 7, 16, 322976) JOHANNESBURG, February 10, 1908
('8', 134, 8, 17, 323008) MY DEAR FRIENDS, I am well in the brotherly and sisterly hands of Mr. and Mrs. Doke.
('8', 134, 8, 18, 323093) I hope to take up my duty shortly.
('8', 134, 8, 19, 323128) Those who have committed the act did not know what they were doing.
('8', 134, 8, 20, 323196) They thought that I was doing what was wrong.
('8', 134, 8, 21, 323242) They have had their redress in the only manner they know.
('8', 134, 8, 22, 323300) I, therefore, request that no steps be taken against them.
('8', 134, 8, 23, 323359) Seeing that the assault was committed by a Mahomedan or Mahomedans, the Hindus might probably feel hurt.
('8', 134, 8, 24, 323464) If so, they would

('8', 135, 1, 3, 323586) Rather let the blood spilt today cement the two communities indissolubly such is my heartfelt prayer.
('8', 135, 1, 4, 323688) May God grant it.
('8', 135, 1, 5, 323706) Assault or no assault, my advice remains the same.
('8', 135, 1, 6, 323757) The large majority of Asiatics ought to give finger prints.
('8', 135, 1, 7, 323817) Those who have real conscientious scruples will be exempted by the Government.
('8', 135, 1, 8, 323896) To ask for more would he to show ourselves as children.
('8', 135, 1, 9, 323952) The spirit of passive resistance, rightly understood, should make the people fear none and nothing but Godno cowardly fear, therefore, should deter the vast majority of sober minded Indians from doing their duty.
('8', 135, 1, 10, 324165) The promise of repeal of the Act against voluntary registration having been given, it is the sacred duty of every good Indian to help the Government and the Colony to the uttermost.

('8', 135, 2, 12, 324426) 76. A DIALOGUE ON THE COMPROMISE
('8', 135, 3, 13, 324459) We find many questions being asked about the compromise that has been arrived at.
('8', 135, 3, 14, 324541) People are saying all kinds of things and some ignorant persons even refer to what is obviously a triumph as if it were a defeat.
('8', 135, 3, 15, 324671) It is our considered opinion that the Transvaal Indians victory goes so deep that every Indian should understand its real significance.
('8', 135, 3, 16, 324807) We therefore answer most of the questions [sent to us] in the form of a dialogue.
('8', 135, 3, 17, 324889) There are two kinds of readers: first, those who pretend to be asleep, that is to say, those who read not indeed to be enlightened but with malicious intent and in order to pick holes; the other kind are those who really fail to see the point and are therefore truly asleep.
('8', 135, 3, 18, 325164) This dialogue is addressed only to the second kind.
('8', 135, 3, 19, 325216) We can wake up those who are asleep.
('8', 135, 3, 20, 325253) As for the others who feign sleep nothing can be done.
('8', 135, 3, 21, 325308) The imaginary dialogue is between a reader and the editor.
('8', 135, 3, 22, 325367) We advise every reader to read through it carefully several times over.
('8', 135, 4, 23, 325439) PREFACE
('8', 135, 5, 24, 325447) READER: Mr. Editor, I want to ask you some questions about your articles on the compromise.
('8', 135, 6, 25, 325539) EDITOR: By all means, do.
('8', 135, 6, 26, 325565) It is our duty to instruct and enlighten our readers to the best of our understanding.
('8', 135, 6, 27, 325652) Our object is to serve the community, and this we can do only if we clear up readers doubts to
('8', 136, 0, 1, 325747) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 137
('8', 136, 1, 2, 325792) their satisfaction.
('8', 136, 1, 3, 325812) I should like to remind you of one thing before you ask any questions.
('8', 136, 1, 4, 325883) An answer, they say, has no meaning except for one who is equipped to understand it.
('8', 136, 1, 5, 325968) For instance, if anyone asks a question about multiplication and division while knowing nothing of addition and subtraction, he is not equipped to understand the answer.
('8', 136, 1, 6, 326138) In the same way you should have the following qualifications for asking questions: you should ask them in the presence of God, with sincere and patriotic intention.
('8', 136, 1, 7, 326303) If you do, you will have no difficulty in following the answers.
('8', 136, 1, 8, 326368) This condition applies to us no less.
('8', 136, 1, 9, 326406) In fact, ours is the greater responsibility, and we are obliged to observe those conditions the more scrupulously.
('8', 136, 1, 10, 326521) That is, whatever you ask us we will answer sincerely with a patriotic regard for the countrys welfare and in the presence of God.
('8', 136, 1, 11, 326652) Now you may ask your questions.
('8', 136, 2, 12, 326684) HOW CAN IT BE CALLED VICTORY?
('8', 136, 3, 13, 326714) READER: You say that the Transvaal Indians have won a complete victory and also that they have got more than they demanded.
('8', 136, 3, 14, 326838) I do not follow this very well.
('8', 136, 4, 15, 326870) EDITOR: You will have to go through some of the back numbers of Indian Opinion.
('8', 136, 4, 16, 326950) If you look into them carefully, you will find that the Indians demanded the annulment of the law and, in return, offered voluntarily to register themselves.
('8', 136, 4, 17, 327108) The monster petition which carried five thousand 1 signatures put forward the same condition.
('8', 136, 4, 18, 327202) There was no question at any time of setting our face against voluntary registration even if it were to take the form prescribed under the law.
('8', 136, 4, 19, 327346) Now the Government has accepted the offer of voluntary registration in writing, saying that the law will be repealed if we register on our own initiative.
('8', 136, 4, 20, 327501) We feel that this, by itself, would have been a complete victory for us.
('8', 136, 4, 21, 327574) According to the terms of the compromise, however, due account will be taken of the status of educated persons and of men of standing who register on their own.
('8', 136, 4, 22, 327735) Moreover, [the right to] voluntary registration will also be allowed to future Indian immi grants into the Transvaal.
('8', 136, 4, 23, 327853) And finally, those who have been relieved of their posts in the Government will most probably be reinstated.
('8', 136, 5, 24, 327962) VOLUNTARY VERSUS COMPULSORY REGISTRATION
('8', 136, 6, 25, 328003) READER: I am still confused about the difference between volun tary and compulsory registration.
('8', 136, 6, 26, 328100) And I know that there are also others who see no difference.
('8', 136, 6, 27, 328161) Do please explain.
('8', 136, 7, 28, 328180) 1Actually the number was 4,522. Vide Letter to colonial secretary, 1 11 1907
('8', 137, 0, 1, 328257) 138 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 137, 1, 2, 328299) EDITOR: I am not surprised at your being unable to understand this.
('8', 137, 1, 3, 328367) The law brought compulsion to bear on us to make us register; that washumiliating.
('8', 137, 1, 4, 328450) So much for compulsory registration.
('8', 137, 1, 5, 328487) But if we take out the same kind of register of our own free will, that will save us the dishonour and even show that we are magnanimous.
('8', 137, 1, 6, 328625) To take an example.
('8', 137, 1, 7, 328645) If, by way of service to a friend, I wash his feet or carry his bed pan, that will strengthen our friendship, give me an inner satis faction and win for me the good opinion of others.
('8', 137, 1, 8, 328829) Another, although he dislikes such work and thinks it derogatory, may yet do the same thing either under duress or for the sake of money.
('8', 137, 1, 9, 328967) We shall think him base [for that reason] and regard him as a slave.
('8', 137, 1, 10, 329036) We shall call him mean.
('8', 137, 1, 11, 329060) He will himself feel ashamed of his job.
('8', 137, 1, 12, 329101) If anyone finds him engaged in that work, he will try to hide himself.
('8', 137, 1, 13, 329172) He is in reality a sinner and will never feel happy in himself.
('8', 137, 1, 14, 329236) The difference between voluntary and compulsory registration is much the same.
('8', 137, 2, 15, 329315) READER: I see the point now, though only partly.
('8', 137, 2, 16, 329364) For I still think that your analogy does not quite hold because it appears that the law will be enforced if we do not take out registers on our own.
('8', 137, 2, 17, 329513) That is to say, we shall be taking out the registers voluntarily under an inducement.
('8', 137, 2, 18, 329599) What you call voluntary therefore appears to me to be tainted both with compulsion and self interest.
('8', 137, 3, 19, 329701) EDITOR: I think you are wrong.
('8', 137, 3, 20, 329732) It is true that, if we do not take out registers voluntarily, we shall be subjected to the [process of the] law.
('8', 137, 3, 21, 329845) But there is no compulsion here.
('8', 137, 3, 22, 329878) If the Government were to say to us, Either you take out the registers, or we shall enforce the law, that would certainly be compulsion.
('8', 137, 3, 23, 330015) But in this case it is we who offered to take out the registers and told the Government that they could enforce the law if we did not.
('8', 137, 3, 24, 330150) We do not make this offer in fear of the sanction [of the law] but as an earnest of our sincerity and because we do not think there is any humiliation in voluntary registration.
('8', 137, 3, 25, 330328) Moreover, being respectable people, we want, through voluntary registration, to dispel the suspicion that the Government harbours about us.
('8', 137, 3, 26, 330468) There is thus no question here of any compulsion.
('8', 137, 3, 27, 330518) If we had been moved at any time by fear, we could not have held out against the Government for 16 months 1 as we have done.
('8', 137, 3, 28, 330643) Afraid of our power the power of our truththe Government has accepted [our offer of] voluntary registration.
('8', 137, 3, 29, 330752) Furthermore, your view that our offer is tainted with self interest is rather ill considered.
('8', 137, 3, 30, 330846) In fact, every act is motivated by some kind of self interest.
('8', 137, 3, 31, 330909) Even in my example, there is an element of self interest in the service which I render to a friend.
('8', 137, 3, 32, 331009) My self interest lies in the
('8', 137, 4, 33, 331038) 1 September 1906 to January 1908
('8', 138, 0, 1, 331071) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 139
('8', 138, 1, 2, 331116) inner happiness which I seek.
('8', 138, 1, 3, 331146) It is the will of God that I should work for such happiness.
('8', 138, 1, 4, 331207) Knowing this as I do, whatever I do to obey that command is in fact inspired by self interest, if of the best kind.
('8', 138, 1, 5, 331323) If I did it so that my friend mightlove me the more, that also would be self interest, albeit of a lower kind.
('8', 138, 1, 6, 331434) In voluntary registration, there is undoubtedly such an element of self interest.
('8', 138, 1, 7, 331516) If a man living as a servant of God devotes himself wholly to the service of men or of all living creatures, he is also impelled by self interest in seeking to be in the presence of God, [that is] to work for nirvana.
('8', 138, 1, 8, 331734) We revere such a man.
('8', 138, 1, 9, 331756) If there were many such in this world, we should find in it holi ness, prosperity, peace, happiness and unity instead of the wickedness, suffering, misery, starvation and disease which we see in it today.
('8', 138, 2, 10, 331961) TEN FINGER [ IMPRESSION]S
('8', 138, 3, 11, 331987) READER: I think I now understand the difference between volun tary and compulsory registration.
('8', 138, 3, 12, 332083) But I see that in any case we are condemned to give the ten finger impressions.
('8', 138, 3, 13, 332163) It appears that the educated and the rich have had their interests protected at the expense of the poor.
('8', 138, 3, 14, 332268) If you accept [the system of] finger impressions now, why did you earlier write so much against them?
('8', 138, 4, 15, 332370) EDITOR: This is indeed a good question, although, if you have really grasped the distinction, the answer to your question is contained in [an earlier] answer.
('8', 138, 4, 16, 332529) However, let us consider your question afresh.
('8', 138, 4, 17, 332576) First, it is not true to say that finger impressions have been ret ained.
('8', 138, 4, 18, 332650) Under the law the finger impressions were to be given by all the members of the community and that meant we were being stigm atized because of the colour of our skin.
('8', 138, 4, 19, 332817) Now the finger impressions remain only as marks of identification.
('8', 138, 4, 20, 332884) Secondly, it is not true to say that the educated and the rich have got off easily.
('8', 138, 4, 21, 332968) Educated persons and men of means and standing can be identified by the knowledge they possess and by their appearance.
('8', 138, 4, 22, 333088) It is humiliating to them even to be asked to give finger impressions.
('8', 138, 4, 23, 333159) Looking at it thus, it does not appear wrong that illiterate persons who are not otherwise known should have to give their finger impressions.
('8', 138, 4, 24, 333302) On the contrary these would ensure the fullest protection for them.
('8', 138, 4, 25, 333370) For instance, not everyone in Durban has to take out domicile certi ficates.
('8', 138, 4, 26, 333447) Men of standing can leave Durban without taking out such certificates.
('8', 138, 4, 27, 333518) But an illiterate person or one otherwise not known would come to grief by following their example.
('8', 138, 4, 28, 333618) He would find it difficult to return.
('8', 138, 4, 29, 333656) Thirdly, it was essential in the past to write all that much against the system of finger impressions.
('8', 138, 4, 30, 333759) We were therefore very glad of it
('8', 139, 0, 1, 333793) 140 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 139, 1, 2, 333835) when, after nine months of struggle, 1 we had definite information in June about finger impression.
('8', 139, 1, 3, 333935) 2 We read everything available on the subject and placed it before the community.
('8', 139, 1, 4, 334017) We were glad that the Satanic, death like law had acquired a bodythe regulations prescri bing finger impressions, etc.
('8', 139, 1, 5, 334136) We knew then that people would be able to see the law for what it was, and that is exactly what happened.
('8', 139, 1, 6, 334242) It was only after the regulations were published that the struggle became really exciting.
('8', 139, 1, 7, 334333) We told the people that in India finger prints were taken only of criminals.
('8', 139, 1, 8, 334410) We published rousing songs about them.
('8', 139, 1, 9, 334449) Verses, such as Of fingers ten, Those Who give impressions Forsaking their pledge to God, still echo in our ears.
('8', 139, 1, 10, 334563) We do not withdraw anything we said then.
('8', 139, 1, 11, 334605) We would still use these verses against those who agreed even to sign their names under the law, let alone give their finger prints.
('8', 139, 2, 12, 334738) READER: Well, a thumb impression is one thing, but you now advise that finger impressions be given.
('8', 139, 2, 13, 334838) What about that?
('8', 139, 3, 14, 334855) EDITOR: Because we were against finger impressions only so long as they were a body inhabited by that Satanic law.
('8', 139, 3, 15, 334970) Now that the Satanic soul has left the body, we have no particular quarrel with it, that is, the finger impressions.
('8', 139, 3, 16, 335087) We think it is honourable, not dishonourable, now to give our finger impressions.
('8', 139, 4, 17, 335169) READER: I am afraid I am getting confused.
('8', 139, 4, 18, 335212) It is too much to believe that finger impressions, which were objectionable before, have suddenly become acceptable.
('8', 139, 4, 19, 335329) I need more light.
('8', 139, 5, 20, 335348) EDITOR: It is only natural that you should feel confused.
('8', 139, 5, 21, 335406) We have given a great deal of thought to this question, so that everything appears quite simple to us.
('8', 139, 5, 22, 335509) You are confronted with these ideas for the first time, and they are bound to sound abstruse.
('8', 139, 5, 23, 335603) The illustration that we gave earlier of friendship and slavery is relevant here also.
('8', 139, 5, 24, 335690) Let us take another example.
('8', 139, 5, 25, 335719) In this country we wear jackets, which is not thought undignified.
('8', 139, 5, 26, 335786) But in India, it would be undignified if we wore short jackets leaving the lower part of the body uncovered by them.
('8', 139, 5, 27, 335903) That means that there are things that may be proper at one place but improper at another.
('8', 139, 5, 28, 335993) In India, it is under compulsion that criminals give their ten finger impressions.
('8', 139, 5, 29, 336076) Here, the same was true of all of us [law abiding Asiatics] under the outrageous law.
('8', 139, 5, 30, 336162) Now we are to give
('8', 139, 6, 31, 336181) 1 September 1906 to June 1907 2 Vide Letter to Rand Daily Mail, 1 7 1907
('8', 140, 0, 1, 336254) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 141
('8', 140, 1, 2, 336299) them on our own and not under compulsion.
('8', 140, 1, 3, 336341) This point should be carefully noted, for we have been advising people to do this [as a voluntary act] all the time, and will continue to do so in future.
('8', 140, 1, 4, 336496) It will reflect credit on our judgment if we appreciate this distinction.
('8', 140, 1, 5, 336570) When it was proposed in the Transvaal that people should be obliged to produce their photographs, the community did right in opposing the proposal.
('8', 140, 1, 6, 336718) Hindus and Muslims do get themselves photographed [but that is] to please themselves or for other reasons.
('8', 140, 1, 7, 336825) You will therefore see that many things are undignified or dignified according to the Object in view.
('8', 140, 2, 8, 336927) READER: I think I see your point.
('8', 140, 2, 9, 336961) But I feel like asking whether all things are like this, good at one time and bad at another.
('8', 140, 3, 10, 337055) EDITOR: No, that certainly cannot be so.
('8', 140, 3, 11, 337096) What is true of our campaign is not true of everything else.
('8', 140, 3, 12, 337157) There are things which are always and everywhere bad or good.
('8', 140, 3, 13, 337219) It is good always and everywhere to pray to God.
('8', 140, 3, 14, 337268) Adultery is always and everywhere bad.
('8', 140, 3, 15, 337307) Generally, the above rule can apply only to things which are not in themselves wicked or evil.
('8', 140, 4, 16, 337402) READER: I can see that from our own point of view there is nothing objectionable about the finger impressions.
('8', 140, 4, 17, 337513) But the whites jeer at us saying: Well, what about finger impressions now? You dont mind playing on the piano now, do you? 1 You talked so big about religion.
('8', 140, 4, 18, 337672) What has happened to all that now? They ply us with mocking questions.
('8', 140, 4, 19, 337743) [The Transvaal] Critic has even published a cartoon 2. Educated persons and businessmen are shown as having been spared offence to their religious susceptibilities, but not so the rest.
('8', 140, 4, 20, 337929) It represents Mr. Gandhi seated on a chair in great dignity and signing his name, while other Indians, miserable creatures, keep standing as they give their finger impressions with large drops of black ink dripping from their fingers.
('8', 140, 4, 21, 338164) How can one bear this?
('8', 140, 4, 22, 338187) How are we to face this?
('8', 140, 5, 23, 338212) EDITOR: This question is a sign of false pride.
('8', 140, 5, 24, 338260) We shall not lose our honour because of the whites taunts.
('8', 140, 5, 25, 338319) We placed our trust in God so that we need only think of what He will say to us.
('8', 140, 5, 26, 338400) There are many whites who have not understood the significance of our campaign.
('8', 140, 5, 27, 338480) Many of them still do not understand that the law which we opposed
('8', 140, 6, 28, 338547) 1 Those who did not join in the satyagraha campaign, that is, the blacklegs, who went to the Registration Office for affixing their finger impressions on their applications for fresh registration certificates under the new law, had earlier been satirized by the satyagrahis.
('8', 140, 6, 29, 338822) The blacklegs had gone to the Registration Office, they mocked, to play on the piano 2 Vide illustration opposite.
('8', 141, 0, 1, 338937) 142 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 141, 1, 2, 338979) will be repealed if we honour our pledge.
('8', 141, 1, 3, 339021) Their eyes will be opened when that time comes.
('8', 141, 1, 4, 339069) Moreover, not every white says these things.
('8', 141, 1, 5, 339114) Newspapers all over England pay us compliments and describe this as a victory for us.
('8', 141, 1, 6, 339200) Rand Daily Mail of Johannesburg has in fact taken the Government to task for having given in on every point to the Indians.
('8', 141, 1, 7, 339324) The Sunday Times has published a cartoon in which a steam roller driven by General Smuts has been reduced to a mere wreckage, and the Indian elephant is turning on him with a threa tening look.
('8', 141, 1, 8, 339518) Many thoughtful whites, and almost everyone outside the Transvaal, have hailed the victory of the Indians.
('8', 141, 1, 9, 339625) Even if this had not been so, we should remember that we have our interests to look after.
('8', 141, 1, 10, 339716) Let others say what they like.
('8', 141, 1, 11, 339747) Let us recall the saying that the person whose self interest is at stake will find the truth hidden inside a small dish, but the neighbour will not notice it even if it were all over the wide sky.
('8', 141, 2, 12, 339944) TEN FINGERS VERSUS TWO THUMBS:
('8', 141, 3, 13, 339975) READER: It is now clear why there should be no objection to finger impressions.
('8', 141, 3, 14, 340055) But as I see it, it was still unnecessary to have agreed to finger impressions at all.
('8', 141, 3, 15, 340142) How did it come about that thumb impressions were not thought sufficient?
('8', 141, 4, 16, 340216) EDITOR: That is worth considering.
('8', 141, 4, 17, 340251) Generally we observe in the world that those who are really brave and noble, fight only for a chosen objective, give their lives for it.
('8', 141, 4, 18, 340388) When they have achieved their purpose, they give in on other points.
('8', 141, 4, 19, 340457) They thus rise in the estimation of others.
('8', 141, 4, 20, 340501) The [stem of the] castor oil plant becomes hollow inside as it grows and will break as soon as it begins to bend a little.
('8', 141, 4, 21, 340624) A banyan tree on the other hand becomes stronger as it grows, and throws out branches groundward, which root themselves and spread out in all directions.
('8', 141, 4, 22, 340778) No one goes to a castor oil plant looking for shelter.
('8', 141, 4, 23, 340833) But thousands of persons can and do find shelter under the banyan tree.
('8', 141, 4, 24, 340905) The Indian community has acted in this manner in accepting the compromise.
('8', 141, 4, 25, 340980) The target of the struggle was the law.
('8', 141, 4, 26, 341020) Now that it has gone, it will be magna nimous of us to yield on the other points.
('8', 141, 4, 27, 341102) The Government argues: You were not fighting against finger impressions.
('8', 141, 4, 28, 341175) Why then are you so obstinate? We have really no answer to this question.
('8', 141, 4, 29, 341249) A person like Mr. Essop Mia will rise in stature by giving his ten finger impressions.
('8', 141, 4, 30, 341336) Mr. Smuts said as much in a public speech.
('8', 141, 4, 31, 341379) Besides, there is much we have to get from the Government yet.
('8', 141, 4, 32, 341442) We should not conclude that we have got all we wanted because the law is gone.
('8', 141, 4, 33, 341521) We need not fawn upon the Government, but it is our duty to keep it in good humour if we can do so without loss of self esteem.
('8', 141, 4, 34, 341649) The law will go of course, but what will
('8', 142, 0, 1, 341690) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 143
('8', 142, 1, 2, 341735) take its place?
('8', 142, 1, 3, 341751) What will be the nature of future laws?
('8', 142, 1, 4, 341791) This depends on how the Indians conduct themselves during the three months to come.
('8', 142, 1, 5, 341875) For this reason, it will be wise to give the ten finger impressions.
('8', 142, 1, 6, 341944) It will not be necessary for everyone to do so.
('8', 142, 1, 7, 341992) Even those who do not will be able to take out registers if they are bona fide residents.
('8', 142, 1, 8, 342082) But in this context honour consists in giving them.
('8', 142, 1, 9, 342134) We have accordingly advised people to do so.
('8', 142, 1, 10, 342179) We even go to the extent of saying that Indians who obstinately refuse to give the ten finger impressions will, in the eyes of others, lack common sense.
('8', 142, 1, 11, 342333) In fact, under the immigration law, women will have to give finger impressions.
('8', 142, 1, 12, 342413) That being so, we shall only fall in the estimation of others by going on arguing about thumb impressions and finger prints.
('8', 142, 1, 13, 342538) Already we arc being thought childish.
('8', 142, 2, 14, 342577) READER: That sounds all right.
('8', 142, 2, 15, 342608) But Indians outside the Transvaal, who have done much to help us, complain that we have secured our own interests without realizing that finger impressions might be intro duced in other Colonies where no one had so far thought of them.
('8', 142, 2, 16, 342844) 1 When a man like Mr. Gandhi, they argue, gives his finger impressions readily, how can anyone else expect his protest to be taken seriously?
('8', 142, 2, 17, 342986) Tile Transvaal Indians, they assert, have brought total ruin on the others.
('8', 142, 2, 18, 343062) How shall we answer these charges?
('8', 142, 3, 19, 343097) EDITOR: It is altogether wrong of people outside the Transvaal to complain in this manner.
('8', 142, 3, 20, 343188) They ought to have understood the nature of the campaign.
('8', 142, 3, 21, 343246) Look at it like this: if the Transvaal Indians give finger impressions of their own accord, why should they become compulsory elsewhere?
('8', 142, 3, 22, 343383) Are people outside the Transvaal women wea ring bangles that they could be compelled to give finger impressions?
('8', 142, 3, 23, 343496) On the contrary, by fighting against the law, the Transvaal has helped the cause of the weak not only in South Africa but all over the world, and thus given them strength.
('8', 142, 3, 24, 343668) The [Natal] Mercury says: 2 All that has been decided is the prin ciple of respecting the rights and feelings of an unenfranchised sec tion of the population, and paying regard to Imperial responsibilities.
('8', 142, 3, 25, 343875) This is [all but] literally true.
('8', 142, 3, 26, 343909) The Indian people who hitherto had no franchise have now, so to speak, been enfranchised.
('8', 142, 3, 27, 343999) To argue that, following this, finger prints may be introduced in other Colonies is as ridiculous as to complain about a side dish in the menu and ignore the excellence of the main course.
('8', 142, 4, 28, 344188) 1 In fact, this happened in Rhodesia.
('8', 142, 4, 29, 344226) 2 This passage is taken from the English version of The Natal Mercurys comment.
('8', 143, 0, 1, 344306) 144 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 143, 1, 2, 344348) Let us also add that finger impressions are likely to be intro duced everywhere sooner or later.
('8', 143, 1, 3, 344445) For, from a scientific point of view, they are the most effective means of identification.
('8', 143, 1, 4, 344536) They cannot offend anyones religious susceptibilities.
('8', 143, 1, 5, 344591) This method of identifica tion was introduced in Natal in 1903 for indentured labourers.
('8', 143, 1, 6, 344680) It applies to a large number of whites in the Transvaal.
('8', 143, 1, 7, 344737) There is there fore no harm in giving finger impressions of our own free choice as we have agreed to do; on the contrary there are a number of advan tages to be gained by doing so.
('8', 143, 1, 8, 344918) It must be borne in mind that at other places, such as the Cape, Delagoa Bay, etc., photographs are required, compared to which finger impressions are a thousand times better.
('8', 143, 1, 9, 345094) 1 Please also remember that, in the Transvaal, the finger prints will figure in the application form and not in the certificate.
('8', 143, 2, 10, 345223) WHY CLASS DISTINCTIONS?
('8', 143, 3, 11, 345247) READER: I shall not say anything more on the question of finger prints; but I must say that I do not understand why Indian Opinion, which was till now opposed to any class distinctions, writes in favour of those that have now been made.
('8', 143, 3, 12, 345484) I have not forgotten the harsh things you said when the Pretoria Memons requested in their petition that men of standing be exempted from giving finger impressions.
('8', 143, 3, 13, 345649) Now you argue that class distinctions may be accepted.
('8', 143, 3, 14, 345704) Will you explain this inconsistency?
('8', 143, 4, 15, 345741) EDITOR: That is a good question.
('8', 143, 4, 16, 345774) Strictly speaking the question of inconsistency would have arisen if this demand had been made by Mr. Gandhi.
('8', 143, 4, 17, 345884) What happened was that the suggestion about this matter came as it were from the Government.
('8', 143, 4, 18, 345977) It would have been improper to reject what in effect the Government offered us as a right.
('8', 143, 4, 19, 346068) There is a great deal of difference between our asking for special privileges for men of standing and the Government offering them on its own.
('8', 143, 4, 20, 346211) Moreover, the distinction that has been made as between classes will also favour educated persons.
('8', 143, 4, 21, 346310) We have never opposed any distin ction being made in their favour.
('8', 143, 4, 22, 346377) For educationtrue educationwill always enjoy respect.
('8', 143, 4, 23, 346431) If even educated persons are required to give finger impressions for purposes of identification, then they cease to be a means of identification and take on a racial aspect.
('8', 143, 4, 24, 346605) Distinctions based on education are nothing unusual.
('8', 143, 4, 25, 346658) There are natural distinctions of class which no one can oppose.
('8', 143, 4, 26, 346723) Our fight is against artificial class distinctions.
('8', 143, 4, 27, 346775) If a distinction is made

('8', 144, 1, 2, 346927) on grounds which leave the official the sole judge, we feel such a distinction spells slavery for us.
('8', 144, 1, 3, 347029) It is true that the class distinction that has been accepted as part of the compromise will leave something to the discretion of the officer.
('8', 144, 1, 4, 347171) But the distinction will remain valid only for a temporary period, and we therefore see no objection to it, provided, of course, that the leaders do not avail themselves of the concession.
('8', 144, 1, 5, 347360) As long as resort is not had to the concession, it will retain the dignity of an ornament.
('8', 144, 1, 6, 347451) We think it will become useless, positively harmful, if a large number of Indians avail themselves of it.
('8', 144, 1, 7, 347557) The distinction that the Memons had asked for was of a different nature.
('8', 144, 1, 8, 347630) Having agreed to submit to the law, they asked for a trivial distinction to be made in respect of finger impressions.
('8', 144, 1, 9, 347748) Besides, it is not as if this demand was made at the instance of the Government.
('8', 144, 1, 10, 347829) That is why they went down on their knees, and were repulsed.
('8', 144, 1, 11, 347891) It will thus be clear that there is a great difference between their request and the distinction that is to be made now.
('8', 144, 1, 12, 348012) If the leaders behave sensibly, this distinction will redound to the advantage of the poor.
('8', 144, 1, 13, 348104) The important thing is that well placed persons should regard themselves as trustees of the poor.
('8', 144, 1, 14, 348202) WHY WERE PEOPLE NOT CONSULTED?
('8', 144, 2, 15, 348233) READER: I think all my doubts have been answered, though, of course, I shall have to think again.
('8', 144, 2, 16, 348331) But one thing continues to trouble me.
('8', 144, 2, 17, 348370) Why did Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Naidoo sign on their own authority?
('8', 144, 2, 18, 348433) They are said to be prudent men, but was it wise on their part to have committed the community without consulting it?
('8', 144, 2, 19, 348551) If they had left things to the community, I might not have even thought of the points I have raised.
('8', 144, 2, 20, 348652) How can we be sure that they have not made a mistake?
('8', 144, 3, 21, 348706) EDITOR: That this doubt should occur to you is itself an indication that you have not fully understood our answers.
('8', 144, 3, 22, 348822) We told you at the outset that the community was already agreed on voluntary registration.
('8', 144, 3, 23, 348913) As the Government agreed to the same thing, there was nothing left to consult the community about.
('8', 144, 4, 24, 349012) READER: But surely the community had not agreed to the giving of finger impressions?
('8', 144, 5, 25, 349097) EDITOR: Are you raising the question of finger impressions all over again?
('8', 144, 5, 26, 349172) It is these which appear to worry you.
('8', 144, 5, 27, 349211) Why do you forget that the struggle was not against finger impressions?
('8', 144, 5, 28, 349283) Why should there be any need to consult [the community] on a point that was not at issue?
('8', 144, 5, 29, 349373) Moreover, how can you argue that finger impressions have now been accepted?
('8', 144, 5, 30, 349449) They [Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Naidoo] have not accepted finger impressions in the manner envisaged by the law.
('8', 144, 5, 31, 349555) Instead they
('8', 145, 0, 1, 349568) 146 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 145, 1, 2, 349610) have left it to the community to give the finger impressions of its own accord.
('8', 145, 1, 3, 349690) Those who insist on giving only two thumb impressions can still do so and have the register.
('8', 145, 1, 4, 349783) Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Naidoo merely suggest to the community that it will be a magnanimous gesture if Indians give their finger impressions on their own and add that they themselves will do so.
('8', 145, 1, 5, 349974) You will agree moreover that those who are accepted as leaders must have a certain freedom [of action] in crises.
('8', 145, 1, 6, 350088) We do not admit having availed ourselves of any such freedom in arriving at this compromise but on an occasion like this we would be justified in saying a few words on peoples duty to the leaders.
('8', 145, 1, 7, 350285) Great care should be exercised in choosing leaders.
('8', 145, 1, 8, 350337) But once they are chosen, it may prove harmful if on occasion they are not allowed any freedom of action.
('8', 145, 1, 9, 350443) If they are required to consult the others every now and again, that will suggest lack of confidence in them.
('8', 145, 1, 10, 350553) In the absence of such confidence work will suffer.
('8', 145, 1, 11, 350605) Confidence in the leaders is a sign of unity, of generosity and of an unflagging spirit among the people.
('8', 145, 1, 12, 350711) No people can progress if its leaders are not honest and if they are not trusted.
('8', 145, 1, 13, 350793) Leaders do sometimes make honest mistakes.
('8', 145, 1, 14, 350836) They are not to be blamed on that account.
('8', 145, 1, 15, 350879) There is only one testthat of sincerity.
('8', 145, 1, 16, 350920) And the best way is that those who are sincere should be trusted.
('8', 145, 2, 17, 350986) CONCLUSION
('8', 145, 3, 18, 350997) READER: I cannot think of any more questions now.
('8', 145, 3, 19, 351047) What do you think will be the outcome of this campaign?
('8', 145, 4, 20, 351103) EDITOR: We hope and pray to God that you and the others who may read the replies will profit by them.
('8', 145, 4, 21, 351205) The final result depends on us.
('8', 145, 4, 22, 351237) If we always show the courage that we have done this time, there will be no obnoxious laws directed against us in future.
('8', 145, 4, 23, 351359) Everyone knows that the Indian community has risen considerably in public esteem.
('8', 145, 4, 24, 351441) That is the important thing.
('8', 145, 4, 25, 351470) Our object in this campaign was to win increased respect for ourselves.
('8', 145, 4, 26, 351542) If we do no more than gather in our gains, that should be good enough.
('8', 145, 4, 27, 351613) Satyagraha should become a common practice; the Indian community can then be assured of success in all fields.
('8', 145, 4, 28, 351724) Nothing can detract from the perfect success of our satyagraha campaign [regardless even of] whether or not the Indian community conducts itself well in the coming three months, whether or not it ke eps its word about voluntary registration.
('8', 145, 4, 29, 351966) Even supposing that giving in on the question of finger impressions was a mistake, satyagraha re

('8', 146, 1, 2, 352109) mains unsullied.
('8', 146, 1, 3, 352126) Its success is complete.
('8', 146, 1, 4, 352151) You may, if you wish, blame those who gave in on the question of finger impressions.
('8', 146, 1, 5, 352236) But truth has emerged victorious.
('8', 146, 1, 6, 352270) Let there be no doubt of that.
('8', 146, 1, 7, 352301) [From Gujarati] Indian Opinion, 15 2 1908
('8', 146, 2, 8, 352343) 77. NATAL LICENCES
('8', 146, 3, 9, 352362) No trading licences have been issued in Estcourt.
('8', 146, 3, 10, 352412) Mr. Kazis store in Stanger has come in for trouble.
('8', 146, 3, 11, 352464) There will be similar trouble at other places as well.
('8', 146, 3, 12, 352519) How will the Indian store keepers be able to carry on business in Natal under these conditions?
('8', 146, 3, 13, 352615) There are two ways.
('8', 146, 3, 14, 352635) One is to take the matter to the court, as the late Mr. Labistour advised.
('8', 146, 3, 15, 352710) That will mean filing a suit against one of the municipalities and going to a great deal of expense and trouble.
('8', 146, 3, 16, 352823) Besides, there is no assurance of success.
('8', 146, 3, 17, 352866) The other way is at once easy and difficult, depending on how one looks at it.
('8', 146, 3, 18, 352945) This is the way of satyagraha.
('8', 146, 3, 19, 352976) [It is easy because] in this case satyagraha will not involve going to gaol.
('8', 146, 3, 20, 353053) Those who carry on trade without licences can only be fined, and in default [the penalty] will be, not imprisonment, but the auctioning of goods.
('8', 146, 3, 21, 353199) It also follows that anyonewhose goods have been once auctioned will not be able to carry on business for the rest of the year.
('8', 146, 3, 22, 353327) There can be repeated auctioning of goods.
('8', 146, 3, 23, 353370) That will mean ruin.
('8', 146, 3, 24, 353391) But every great task is bound to involve a heavy sacrifice.
('8', 146, 3, 25, 353451) As a devotee has said, to live a life of constant devotion to God one must pledge ones life; so difficult is the journey ahead of us.
('8', 146, 3, 26, 353585) Satyagraha does call for devotiondevotion to ones country.
('8', 146, 3, 27, 353644) It does require us to pledge our life [to the cause].
('8', 146, 3, 28, 353698) It can be resorted to only for the common good, not for mere self advancement.
('8', 146, 3, 29, 353777) Traders in Natal may find such a struggle a little more difficult than those in the Transvaal had found it.
('8', 146, 3, 30, 353885) It should be, truly speaking, easy.
('8', 146, 3, 31, 353921) It is difficult, because people can take cover behind the argument that they are prepared for imprisonment but not for the loss of goods.
('8', 146, 3, 32, 354059) Moreover, the entire community will not be able to join in the struggle, so that it will be left to a few individuals only to fight it out.
('8', 146, 3, 33, 354199) It should [on the contrary], be easy for the reason that, in our experience, Indians, and other communities as well, generally fight shy of going to gaol but do not much mind auctioning of their goods.
('8', 146, 3, 34, 354401) Besides, no great risk is involved in allowing the goods to be auctioned.
('8', 146, 3, 35, 354475) A clever man can hold out against [the Government] through skilful tactics.
('8', 146, 3, 36, 354551) The main thing is for everyone to carry on
('8', 147, 0, 1, 354594) 148 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 147, 1, 2, 354636) trade without a licence, if a single person is refused a licence without valid reasons.
('8', 147, 1, 3, 354724) If the Government cannot throw everyone into prison, it cannot possibly auction everyones goods either.
('8', 147, 1, 4, 354828) Unity is absolutely essential.
('8', 147, 1, 5, 354859) We do not mean to suggest that all businessmenall over Natal, that isshould trade without licences; only the businessmen of the town or division concerned need do so.
('8', 147, 1, 6, 355026) Licences may well be refused to some individuals after they have been issued to all the others.
('8', 147, 1, 7, 355122) In that case, those traders who do not get licences can continue their business and let the Government do its worst.
('8', 147, 1, 8, 355239) This will require intelligence and presence of mind.
('8', 147, 1, 9, 355292) Another way out is to rent premises for the store furnished with the landlords benches, etc.
('8', 147, 1, 10, 355385) The store should be stocked light so that the saleable goods may be disposed of from day to day or transferred to another person at short notice.
('8', 147, 1, 11, 355531) If we follow these tactics the Governments policy of imposing a fine each time will be defeated.
('8', 147, 1, 12, 355628) When a fine is imposed, a meeting should be called to make it known to the Government that the entire community approves of the person concerned carrying on unlicensed trade.
('8', 147, 1, 13, 355803) This will tire out the Government.
('8', 147, 1, 14, 355838) But this [course] is only for the brave and patriotic.
('8', 147, 1, 15, 355893) Those who live merely for themselves are no better than stone.
('8', 147, 1, 16, 355956) They cannot muster the kind of courage which comes only when one fights for the rights of all.
('8', 147, 1, 17, 356051) It is simple for hawkers to hold out against the Government, which will then proceed to amend the law of its own accord.
('8', 147, 1, 18, 356172) Let there be no mistake about this: the Transvaal campaign has won more respect for Indians, and the Government is bound to feel alarmed.
('8', 147, 1, 19, 356310) This step should only be taken publicly; that is why meetings should be held for the purpose; resolutions should be forwarded to the Government, and then alone should the actual campaign be begun.
('8', 147, 1, 20, 356507) All the steps taken in the Transvaal should be followed, beginning with the first.
('8', 147, 1, 21, 356590) There are precedents for this kind of action.
('8', 147, 1, 22, 356636) Englishmen let their goods be auctioned rather than pay the education cess.
('8', 147, 1, 23, 356712) Now no one troubles them.
('8', 147, 1, 24, 356738) The late Mr. Bradlaugh 1 had his own way of making himself feared by the entire British nation.
('8', 147, 1, 25, 356834) How he did that we shall explain another time.
('8', 147, 2, 26, 356881) 1 Charles Bradlaugh (1833 91); English free thinker and politician; for many years associate of Annie Besant and editor of National Reformer.
('8', 147, 2, 27, 357023) In 1880, he was elected M.P. from Northampton but could enter Parliament only in 1886 after six years of wrangling over oath taking which he wanted to do by affirming under the Parliamentary Oaths Act and not on the Bible.
('8', 147, 2, 28, 357246) An atheist and iconoclast, he was a natural leader in causes which had society against them.

('8', 148, 1, 2, 357384) Let the gentlemen in Natal, if they wish to start a campaign, call a big meeting for the purpose; let them, standing united, embark on this course cool headedly with God as witness.
('8', 148, 1, 3, 357566) They should note that,once the first step is taken, there must be no turning back.
('8', 148, 1, 4, 357649) It may be wise in the first instance not to make a beginning.
('8', 148, 1, 5, 357711) Wisdom consists in not retreating once a beginning has been made.

('8', 148, 3, 8, 357840) We wrote about Mr. Ritch last week.
('8', 148, 3, 9, 357876) Everyone, we think, feels that something should be done for Mr. Ritch as a mark of our appreciation of his work.
('8', 148, 3, 10, 357989) He has worked for all South Africa and is still doing so.
('8', 148, 3, 11, 358047) We therefore believe that every Indian should join in the effort.
('8', 148, 3, 12, 358113) No sum that we collect can be too large.
('8', 148, 3, 13, 358154) It would not be extravagant even if we engaged Mr. Ritch at 1,000 per annum.
('8', 148, 3, 14, 358231) We have been paying him just enough for his bare needs.
('8', 148, 3, 15, 358287) Ever since we heard of Mrs. Ritchs illness, he has been allowed to draw enough money to meet his needs at home.
('8', 148, 3, 16, 358399) Formerly, he was paid only 15 per month.
('8', 148, 3, 17, 358440) That is, we have not paid him more than 25 a month on an average.
('8', 148, 3, 18, 358506) We do not think it would be too much if we presented him a purse of, say, 300 at the least.
('8', 148, 3, 19, 358598) It would certainly not be wrong to send more.
('8', 148, 3, 20, 358644) By honouring Mr. Ritch we honour ourselves.
('8', 148, 3, 21, 358688) Doing this may also win others over to our side.
('8', 148, 3, 22, 358737) Not, certainly, that people will be attracted by money, but because they will realize that we have [a tradition of] nobility.
('8', 148, 3, 23, 358863) If someone offers to help in hope of profit, he should be kept at arms length.
('8', 148, 3, 24, 358942) As for Mr. Ritch, he does not even dream of monetary gain.
('8', 148, 3, 25, 359001) He will cease to be useful the moment he begins to think of such gain.
('8', 148, 3, 26, 359072) We are starting a collection for this purpose, and hope that a large number of Indians will contribute to it.
('8', 148, 3, 27, 359182) That will be a handsome [gesture] and no one individual will feel the burden.
('8', 148, 3, 28, 359260) If our readers, several hundreds of them, make up their minds, the collections can be concluded soon.
('8', 148, 3, 29, 359362) All contributions will be acknowledged in Indian Opinion.
('8', 148, 3, 30, 359420) Let everyone remember that contributions for Dr. Booth 2 came mostly from the poor.

('8', 149, 3, 6, 360290) BRITISH INDIAN ASSOCIATION
('8', 149, 4, 7, 360317) The British Indian Association of the Transvaal has started collections for a large fund.
('8', 149, 4, 8, 360407) It has been decided not to accept less than 10s from anyone and that everyone should pay the most he can.
('8', 149, 4, 9, 360513) The main object of the collection is to build a large hall in Johannesburg.
('8', 149, 4, 10, 360589) There is no building anywhere in South Africa that would do credit to the Indian community.
('8', 149, 4, 11, 360681) This is a drawback.
('8', 149, 4, 12, 360701) Surely it would be a good idea to put up such a building in Johannesburg.
('8', 149, 4, 13, 360775) Every prominent community has a hall similar to the one proposed.
('8', 149, 4, 14, 360841) That we do not have one is a matter for shame.
('8', 149, 4, 15, 360888) Truly speaking, there should be a hall of this kind in every city, such as Cape Town, Durban, Maritzburg, etc.
('8', 149, 4, 16, 360999) It is a sign of our backwardness that there is not one.
('8', 149, 4, 17, 361055) People in the Transvaal have therefore decided to build such a hall in Johan nesburg.
('8', 149, 4, 18, 361141) It is also intended to present handsome addresses to Lord Ampthill 1 and Sir Muncherjee Bhownaggree 2 for the invaluable work they have done.
('8', 149, 4, 19, 361283) There is also a proposal to express, in a concrete form, our appreciation of the services rendered by Mr. Polak, Miss Schlesin who has taxed herself to her utmost by labouring day and night, and other whites who have put themselves out equally.
('8', 149, 4, 20, 361528) The expenditure on all these things is to be met from the fund that is now being raised.
('8', 149, 4, 21, 361617) The ten shilling receipts bear Mr. Essop Mias signature
('8', 149, 5, 22, 361673) 1 Arthur Oliver Villiers Russell, Second Baron of Ampthill (1869 1935); a founder of the National Party, 1918; Governor of Madras, 1899 1906; Viceroy and Governor General of India (pro tem.), 1904; wrote foreword to Dokes biography of Gandhiji.
('8', 149, 5, 23, 361918) 2 Sir Muncherjee Merwanjee Bhownaggree (1851 1933); Parsi barrister settled in England.
('8', 149, 5, 24, 362006) As a Member of Parliament for over ten years, elected on the Unionist Party ticket, and as a member of the British Committee of the Indian National Congress in London, he helped considerably in educating public opinion in England in regard to the grievances of Indians in South Africa.

('8', 150, 1, 4, 362454) Receipt books have been despatched to a number of towns.

('8', 150, 1, 7, 362733) The collections should be concluded and the amounts forwarded as soon as possible.
('8', 150, 1, 8, 362816) I advise everyone to preserve the receipt as a memento of the campaign.
('8', 150, 1, 9, 362888) Also, it can be shown to others who may come asking for contribu tions.
('8', 150, 1, 10, 362960) If a large number of persons take up the work of collection, it can be finished before the voluntary registration is over.

('8', 150, 3, 13, 363173) February 15,1908 .
('8', 150, 3, 14, 363192) The repeal of the Act was the fixed goal undertaken in the name of God; so far as I am aware, in making for that goal we have never swerved from that path, and have we not reached the goal in the least possible time and with the fewest scratches?...

('8', 150, 5, 16, 363493) 81. SECRET OF SATYAGRAHA
('8', 150, 6, 17, 363518) There appears to have been a good deal of misunderstanding following the Transvaal Indians failure to comprehend the secret of satyagraha.
('8', 150, 6, 18, 363657) It is therefore necessary to give a little more thought to satyagraha in the context of our victory against the obnoxious law.
('8', 150, 6, 19, 363784) Those who know the real meaning of satyagraha should not have the slightest doubt as to what the victory means.
('8', 150, 6, 20, 363896) A satyagrahi enjoys a degree of freedom not possible for others, for he becomes a truly fearless person.
('8', 150, 6, 21, 364001) Once his mind is rid of fear, he will never agree to be anothers slave.
('8', 150, 6, 22, 364073) Having achieved this state of mind, he will never submit to any arbitrary action.
('8', 150, 6, 23, 364155) Such satyagraha can be, ought to be, practised not only against a Government but against society as well [if need be].
('8', 150, 6, 24, 364274) It can oftenhappen that a society is as wrong as a government.
('8', 150, 6, 25, 364337) It becomes ones duty then to use satyagraha against society.
('8', 150, 6, 26, 364398) The late
('8', 150, 7, 27, 364407) 1 This is taken from a precise of events in the Transvaal sent by Ritch along with his letter of October 6, 1908 to the Colonial Office.
('8', 151, 0, 1, 364544) 152 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 151, 1, 2, 364586) Mr. Thoreau, whose book 1 we have already summarized, thought that his country men did wrong in carrying on slave trade.
('8', 151, 1, 3, 364707) He therefore ranged him self against his people.
('8', 151, 1, 4, 364756) The great Luther defied his people single handed and it is thanks to him that Germany enjoys freedom today.
('8', 151, 1, 5, 364864) And there was Galileo who opposed society.
('8', 151, 1, 6, 364907) The people were resolved to kill him.
('8', 151, 1, 7, 364945) Undaunted, he told them that they could kill him if they wanted to, but that it was nevertheless true that the earth revolved [round the sun].
('8', 151, 1, 8, 365088) Today, we all know that the earth is round and that it rotates round its axis once every 24 hours.
('8', 151, 1, 9, 365187) Columbus acted like a true satyagrahi when facing his sailors.
('8', 151, 1, 10, 365250) Exhausted [by the long voyage], they declared, We will never get to America.
('8', 151, 1, 11, 365327) Let us turn back, else we will kill you. Unperturbed, Columbus answered, I am not afraid of being killed, but I think we ought to go on for a few days more. They did discover America, and Columbus won everlasting fame.
('8', 151, 1, 12, 365546) Such a wonderful remedy is this satyagraha.
('8', 151, 1, 13, 365590) When we ask in fear what will happen if the Government does not repeal the Act, we only betray the deficiency of our satyagraha or talk as if we had been unmanned, having lost the weapon of satyagraha.
('8', 151, 1, 14, 365792) But our satyagraha prompts us to become free and feel independent.
('8', 151, 1, 15, 365859) We have therefore nothing to fear.
('8', 151, 1, 16, 365894) All this is idle talk.
('8', 151, 1, 17, 365917) Whatever you do, you cannot start the campaign again.
('8', 151, 1, 18, 365971) Once has been quite enough. There are persons who talk thus.
('8', 151, 1, 19, 366032) If it is true that we cannot resume the struggle, it will have been in vain that we started it at all.
('8', 151, 1, 20, 366135) Let us justify this view of ours.
('8', 151, 1, 21, 366169) It is a matter of common observation that what we have won can be retained only by the same means through which it was got.
('8', 151, 1, 22, 366293) What is won by force can be retained by force alone.
('8', 151, 1, 23, 366346) A tiger seizes its prey by force, and retains it through force.
('8', 151, 1, 24, 366410) Those who are forcibly locked up in gaol are kept there by force.
('8', 151, 1, 25, 366476) The territories acquired by emperors by use of force are retained by force.
('8', 151, 1, 26, 366552) In the same manner, what is gained by love can be retained only by love.
('8', 151, 1, 27, 366625) The mother feels great love for the child in her womb and rears it with the same love afterwards.
('8', 151, 1, 28, 366723) Its punishment while yet a child should not be interpreted as use of force.
('8', 151, 1, 29, 366799) There are also instances where a mother has lost a child altogether because she stopped loving it for some reason.
('8', 151, 1, 30, 366914) Similarly what we have gained by satyagraha can be retained only through satyagraha.
('8', 151, 1, 31, 366999) When satyagraha is given up, we may be sure that the gains will also be lost.
('8', 151, 1, 32, 367077) Moreover, it is unlikely that one will succeed in retaining through physical force what one gained by satyagraha.
('8', 151, 1, 33, 367191) Suppose Indians wish to retain by

('8', 152, 1, 2, 367393) force the fruits of victory won through satyagraha.
('8', 152, 1, 3, 367445) Even a child can see that, if Indians resort to force, they can be crushed within the minute.
('8', 152, 1, 4, 367539) Likewise, if we abandon satyagraha and go on as we did before, what we have gained may be lost.
('8', 152, 1, 5, 367635) These examples serve to show that satyagraha is really an attitude of mind.
('8', 152, 1, 6, 367711) He who has attained to the satyagrahic state of mind will remain ever victorious, at all times and places and under all conditions irrespective of whether it is a government or a people that he opposes, whether they be strangers, friends or relatives.
('8', 152, 1, 7, 367963) It is only because we do not appreciate the marvel of satyagraha that we live in India as a poor and cowardly race, not only in our relations with the Government but in our personal relations as well.
('8', 152, 1, 8, 368164) Certain customs which are palpably evil are kept alive in our country mainly because we lack in [the spirit of] satyagraha.
('8', 152, 1, 9, 368288) Though well aware that certain customs are bad, we do very little to end them either because of fear, laziness or undue regard for others.
('8', 152, 1, 10, 368427) Before concluding, let me refer to the latest instance.
('8', 152, 1, 11, 368483) When the whites held an anti Indian meeting in Pretoria Town Hall, there were only four whites to speak in our favour.
('8', 152, 1, 12, 368602) They were thus four against a thousand.
('8', 152, 1, 13, 368642) But the four were brave enough to express their views in the face of a chorus of abuse from the crowd.
('8', 152, 1, 14, 368745) In the event, their satya graha considerably detracted from the importance of the meeting and turned it into a menagerie.
('8', 152, 1, 15, 368867) We urge every Indian to follow these ideas carefully.
('8', 152, 1, 16, 368921) Those who do will learn the true nature of our success and find themselves equal to the tasks which the Indian community has to face.

('8', 152, 2, 18, 369097) 82. MY REWARD 1
('8', 152, 3, 19, 369113) BEGINNING
('8', 152, 4, 20, 369123) For my part, I am not in the least surprised that I was assaulted.
('8', 152, 4, 21, 369190) I had declared even on the 9th that, in view of the promise about the repeal of the law, I did not see any dishonour in giving finger impres sions outside the law.
('8', 152, 4, 22, 369354) On the contrary, I thought it was honourable togive them.
('8', 152, 4, 23, 369412) When, in the meeting in front of the Mosque, there was strong opposition to the idea of Indians voluntarily giving their finger impressions, I asked myself what I would do if I had the real spirit of satyagraha in me, and then I declared my resolution that, if I
('8', 152, 5, 24, 369675) 1 This was published as From Mr. Gandhi.
('8', 153, 0, 1, 369716) 154 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 153, 1, 2, 369758) was alive on Monday, I would positively give my finger impressions.
('8', 153, 1, 3, 369826) I still do not regret having done so; rather, I think that I did my duty to my God and my community.
('8', 153, 1, 4, 369927) When at a quarter to ten on Monday morning I set out towards the Registration Office in the company of Mr. Essop Mia, Mr. Naidoo and a few other Indians, I did feel that there might be an attack on me.
('8', 153, 1, 5, 370129) In fact, I had spotted two of the assailants near the office.
('8', 153, 1, 6, 370191) They walked alongside of us.
('8', 153, 1, 7, 370220) I then became surer.
('8', 153, 1, 8, 370241) But I decided that I should not, as I had declared earlier, mind being assaulted by my own brethren.
('8', 153, 1, 9, 370342) Some way ahead, one of the men asked, Where are you all going? Mr. Essop Mia was about to answer, when I interrupted saying, I am going [to the Registration Office] to give my finger impressions.
('8', 153, 1, 10, 370538) The others, too, will do the same.
('8', 153, 1, 11, 370573) If you want to give your thumb impressions [only], you can do that. My only recol lection of what followed is that I received very severe blows.
('8', 153, 1, 12, 370718) I took severe blows on my left ribs.
('8', 153, 1, 13, 370755) Even now I find breathing difficult.
('8', 153, 1, 14, 370792) My upper lip has a cut on one side.
('8', 153, 1, 15, 370828) I have a bruise above the left eye and a wound on the forehead.
('8', 153, 1, 16, 370892) In addition, there are minor injuries on my right hand and left knee.
('8', 153, 1, 17, 370962) I do not remember the manner of the assault, but people say that I fell down unconscious with the first blow which was delivered with a stick.
('8', 153, 1, 18, 371105) Then my assailants struck me with an iron pipe and a stick, and they also kicked me.
('8', 153, 1, 19, 371190) Thinking me dead, they stopped.
('8', 153, 1, 20, 371222) I only remember having been beaten up.
('8', 153, 1, 21, 371261) I have an impression that, as the blows started, I uttered the words He Rama!.
('8', 153, 1, 22, 371340) Mr. Thambi Naidoo and Mr. Essop Mia inter vened.
('8', 153, 1, 23, 371389) Mr. Naidoo was hit as a result and injured on the ear.
('8', 153, 1, 24, 371444) Mr. Essop Mia received a slight injury on a finger.
('8', 153, 1, 25, 371496) As I came to, I got up with a smile.
('8', 153, 1, 26, 371533) In my mind there was not the slightest anger or hatred for the assailants.
('8', 153, 1, 27, 371608) On reflection, I feel that we fear death needlessly.
('8', 153, 1, 28, 371661) I believe that I have not known such fear for a long time now.
('8', 153, 1, 29, 371724) And I have grown more fearless after this incident.
('8', 153, 1, 30, 371776) If I had not regained consciousness, I would not have felt the suffering that I went through later.
('8', 153, 1, 31, 371876) We can thus see that there is suffering only as long as the soul is in intimate union with the body.
('8', 153, 1, 32, 371977) I became aware of the suffering only when the souls union with the body was restored.
('8', 153, 1, 33, 372063) NO ONE TO BLAME I do not blame anyone for the assault.
('8', 153, 1, 34, 372118) 1 Those who attacked me
('8', 153, 2, 35, 372142) 1 Gandhiji in fact wired to the Attorney General to say that his assailants were not guilty; vide Satyagraha in South Africa, Ch. XXII.
('8', 153, 2, 36, 372278) The telegram itself, however, is not available.
('8', 154, 0, 1, 372326) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 155
('8', 154, 1, 2, 372371) would have at one time greeted me and welcomed me enthusiastically.
('8', 154, 1, 3, 372439) When they assaulted me, it was in the belief that I had done them and the community harm.
('8', 154, 1, 4, 372529) Some people thought I had sold the community by having agreed to [the system of] finger impressions [in our compromise] with the Government.
('8', 154, 1, 5, 372670) If that is what they thought, is it surprising that they attacked me?
('8', 154, 1, 6, 372740) If they had had some education, they would, instead of assaulting me, have adopted other means of venting their dislike of me.
('8', 154, 1, 7, 372867) In either case, they would have had the same reason.
('8', 154, 1, 8, 372920) Experience tells me that some people know of only one way of expressing disapproval.
('8', 154, 1, 9, 373005) For them physical strength is the one supreme thing.
('8', 154, 1, 10, 373058) How then could I be angry?
('8', 154, 1, 11, 373085) What point would there be in having them prosecuted?
('8', 154, 1, 12, 373138) My real duty consists in disproving their charge against me.
('8', 154, 1, 13, 373199) That will take time.
('8', 154, 1, 14, 373220) Meanwhile, as is the way of the world, people will persist in the methods of violence.
('8', 154, 1, 15, 373307) In this situation, the duty of the wise man is only to bear the suffering in patience.
('8', 154, 1, 16, 373394) I think of myself as a wise person.
('8', 154, 1, 17, 373430) I have therefore no choice but to endure the suffering inflicted on me.
('8', 154, 1, 18, 373502) My religion teaches me to have no fear save of God.
('8', 154, 1, 19, 373554) If I had any such fear, I should be violating a divine command.
('8', 154, 1, 20, 373618) Why then should I be afraid of suffering?
('8', 154, 1, 21, 373660) I therefore ask of God that I may remain fearless till the last.
('8', 154, 1, 22, 373725) I ask my well wishers to say the same prayer.
('8', 154, 2, 23, 373771) NURSING
('8', 154, 3, 24, 373779) When I came to somewhat, I was taken to Mr. Gibsons office, oppo site which I had been attacked.
('8', 154, 3, 25, 373876) I was attended to by Mr. Lew 1 and Mr. Gibson Junior.
('8', 154, 3, 26, 373930) A doctor washed the wounds.
('8', 154, 3, 27, 373958) They were thinking of removing me to hospital.
('8', 154, 3, 28, 374005) Mr. Doke, a clergyman, who did a great deal of work for us during the later stages [of our campaign], hurried to the spot on hearing news of the assault; he suggested that I should be taken to his place.
('8', 154, 3, 29, 374209) After some deliberation, I agreed to his suggestion.
('8', 154, 3, 30, 374262) Mr. Doke is a Baptist and nearly forty six years old.
('8', 154, 3, 31, 374316) He has travelled widely in New Zealand, India, Wellestown 2 and other countries.
('8', 154, 3, 32, 374397) He came here from Grahamstown three months ago.
('8', 154, 3, 33, 374445) Judging from the way he looked after me and from his nature and that of his family, he must be a godly person indeed.
('8', 154, 3, 34, 374563) He is not exactly a friend.
('8', 154, 3, 35, 374591) I had met him barely three or four times before then, and that in connection with the campaign in order to explain the position to him.
('8', 154, 3, 36, 374727) It was thus a stranger whom he took into his house.

('8', 155, 1, 2, 374983) members of his family remained in constant attendance on me.
('8', 155, 1, 3, 375044) His sons room was put at my disposal, and the son himself slept on the floor in the library.
('8', 155, 1, 4, 375137) While I was ill, Mr. Doke would not allow the slightest noise anywhere in the house.
('8', 155, 1, 5, 375222) Even the children moved about very quietly.
('8', 155, 1, 6, 375266) Mr. Doke took the sanitary part of the duties on himself, while I looked helplessly on.
('8', 155, 1, 7, 375354) The work of bandaging me, of washing the bandages, etc., was taken on by Mrs. Doke.
('8', 155, 1, 8, 375438) They would not allow me to do even what I could have well done myself.
('8', 155, 1, 9, 375509) Both husband and wife sat up [at my bedside] through the first night.
('8', 155, 1, 10, 375579) They came into the room every now and again to see if I wanted anything.
('8', 155, 1, 11, 375652) In the mornings Mr. Doke was busy receiving people who came to inquire after me.
('8', 155, 1, 12, 375733) Every day nearly 50 Indians called.
('8', 155, 1, 13, 375769) So long as he was in the house, he would take every Indian, whether he appeared clean or otherwise, into his drawing room, offer him a seat and then bring him to me.
('8', 155, 1, 14, 375935) He would also gently remind everyone that I should not be disturbed much.
('8', 155, 1, 15, 376009) This is how he looked after me.
('8', 155, 1, 16, 376041) He did more than attend on me and attend to all those who came to see me.
('8', 155, 1, 17, 376115) He also did whatever he could about the difficulties of the community.
('8', 155, 1, 18, 376186) Besides, he would call on Mr. Cartwright, Mr. Phillips and others, carry messages from me and do of his own accord whatever appeared necessary.
('8', 155, 1, 19, 376330) It is small wonder that a nation which produces such men should march forward.
('8', 155, 1, 20, 376409) And how can one say that a religion to which such gentle, kind hearted and really noble persons belong is false in any way?
('8', 155, 1, 21, 376533) His only object in doing all this was to please God.
('8', 155, 1, 22, 376586) He also, as was his wont, prayed nightly sitting by my bed.
('8', 155, 1, 23, 376646) In his daily life, too, he always said grace before and after a meal.
('8', 155, 1, 24, 376716) His children were also made to take turns at reading from the Bible.
('8', 155, 1, 25, 376785) I at any rate could see no selfish motive in him; in his conduct and in the education of the children, all that one could see was truth.
('8', 155, 1, 26, 376922) I saw no touch of insincerity in anything that he did, neither did I feel that anything was done to Please others.
('8', 155, 1, 27, 377037) It is not often we come across such single mindedness and nobility in Hindu or Muslim priests and grihasthas 1. These are not common even in Englishmen.
('8', 155, 1, 28, 377190) Some nations have more of these [qualities], others have less.
('8', 155, 1, 29, 377253) Without entering into a discussion of that point, I would only pray that there might be hundreds of Indian families like Mr. Dokes.
('8', 155, 2, 30, 377385) TREATMENT

('8', 156, 1, 3, 377606) Though I was under the care of a physician, the treatment consisted entirely of home cure methods.
('8', 156, 1, 4, 377705) For the first two days I had nothing to eat or drink.
('8', 156, 1, 5, 377759) That had the effect of keeping the fever down.
('8', 156, 1, 6, 377806) On the third day I had no temperature.
('8', 156, 1, 7, 377845) I started on a diet of a quarter pound of milk, and gradually added to it grapes, pears and other fruit.
('8', 156, 1, 8, 377950) Then I began taking bread dunked in milk once a day.
('8', 156, 1, 9, 378003) I am still on that diet.
('8', 156, 1, 10, 378028) On account of an injury to three of the upper teeth, I shall not be able to eat anything hard for several days to come.
('8', 156, 1, 11, 378148) Apart from the wounds, my mouth was swollen and so was my forehead.
('8', 156, 1, 12, 378216) A poultice of clean earth was put on these, and the swelling has now subsided.
('8', 156, 1, 13, 378295) I had been badly hit in the ribs, and here again the recovery is nearly complete thanks to a large poultice of earth The doctor was afraid that the application of earthen poultice on wounds might cause sepsis.
('8', 156, 1, 14, 378505) But I had them put on my own responsibility.
('8', 156, 1, 15, 378550) The doctor is now, however, convinced that the earthen poultice has done much good.
('8', 156, 1, 16, 378634) Normally wounds which have to be stitched up rarely escape becoming septic.
('8', 156, 1, 17, 378710) I am emphatically of the view that with an earthen poultice wounds heal without becoming septic.
('8', 156, 1, 18, 378807) And that is what has happened.
('8', 156, 1, 19, 378838) I have used many remedies involving the use of earth.
('8', 156, 1, 20, 378892) I think, if earth is judiciously used, it can be a useful remedy in many ailments.
('8', 156, 1, 21, 378975) I hope later to be able to tell readers of Indian Opinion [more about] my experiences.
('8', 156, 3, 22, 379062) My object in writing this account is not merely to tell a story or to fill the pages of this journal, but only that my experience may be of use to others.
('8', 156, 3, 23, 379217) The lesson that every servant of India is to draw from the assault is this: if anyone wants to serve the community, and always do the right by it, he must be prepared for physical assaults.
('8', 156, 3, 24, 379407) If we do not take these things to heart, we shall have more peace of mind and happiness and, to that extent, more strength to serve the community.
('8', 156, 3, 25, 379554) Such assaults should really be looked upon as rewards.
('8', 156, 3, 26, 379609) Mr. Dokes conduct shows us all the path of goodness and the home remedies described here are worth noting.
('8', 156, 3, 27, 379716) Mr. Doke received nearly 40 telegrams of thanks from different parts [of the Colony] and some Indians sent him fruits and other gifts as a mark of their gratitude.

('8', 157, 2, 3, 379988) DREW S LETTER Mr. Drew 1, who is the editor of The Friend of Bloemfontein and a Member of Parliament in the Orange River Colony, says in a letter: I thought it was an easy victory you had achieved with a brief term of imprisonment.
('8', 157, 2, 4, 380220) But I see now that you were not to be let off so lightly.
('8', 157, 2, 5, 380278) However, I hope that your community will accept the very excellent and honourable compromise that has been reached.
('8', 157, 2, 6, 380394) If it does not, the Indians will not retain the sympathies even of a single European.
('8', 157, 2, 7, 380480) Mr. Drews words deserve to be pondered over.
('8', 157, 2, 8, 380525) Readers of Indian Opinion know that, when others were against us, Mr. Drews sympathies were with us.
('8', 157, 2, 9, 380626) He has also been of great help in a private capacity.
('8', 157, 2, 10, 380680) When a person like him writes in this manner, we should infer that things have come to a pretty pass indeed.
('8', 157, 3, 11, 380789) HOW LONG WILL REGISTRATION OFFICE REMAIN OPEN?
('8', 157, 3, 12, 380836) Many persons have asked this question.
('8', 157, 3, 13, 380875) The reply is, As long as necessary.
('8', 157, 3, 14, 380911) There can be no exact time limit to voluntary registra tion.
('8', 157, 3, 15, 380972) But, since about a thousand people register every week and as summing the population [of Indians in Johannesburg] to be five thousand, it appears probable that [the Office] will remain open for five weeks.
('8', 157, 4, 16, 381178) WILL POLICE DEMAND [REGISTERS]?
('8', 157, 5, 17, 381210) The person asking this question has not understood the compromise.
('8', 157, 5, 18, 381277) Those who take out registers voluntarily will not be subject in any way to the obnoxious law or to the regulations made under it.
('8', 157, 5, 19, 381407) There exists a written assurance to that effect.
('8', 157, 5, 20, 381456) The question above does not therefore arise.
('8', 157, 5, 21, 381501) I do not mean by this that the police will never question anyone.
('8', 157, 5, 22, 381567) After registers have been taken out volun tarily, there is bound to be a new law of some kind.
('8', 157, 5, 23, 381662) It will contain some sections providing for interrogation [by the police].
('8', 157, 5, 24, 381737) Whatthese sections will be and what form the new law will take depends on how
('8', 157, 6, 25, 381815) Dewdney Drew.
('8', 157, 6, 26, 381829) In Satyagraha in South Africa, Gandhiji describes him as one of the best speakers in South Africa.
('8', 157, 6, 27, 381928) He supported the Indian cause in the teeth of European opposition.
('8', 157, 6, 28, 381995) Earlier, he had given up orders to take up the editorship of The Friend.

('8', 158, 1, 2, 382113) the Indian community conducts itself during the next three months.
('8', 158, 1, 3, 382180) By refusing to understand a very minor point and by their childish insistence [on not giving finger impressions], the Pathans have created an unfavourable impression on the Government.
('8', 158, 1, 4, 382365) If, in spite of this, the Government is convinced that the other members of the Indian community are sensible, honest and well behaved, the law that is to be enacted may well be worthy of such a people.
('8', 158, 1, 5, 382568) Let it be noted, therefore, that every Indian now bears a heavy responsibility.
('8', 158, 1, 6, 382648) We will have to deal with the local authorities at every step.
('8', 158, 1, 7, 382711) The Imperial Government will not interfere in these dealings.
('8', 158, 1, 8, 382773) Indeed, it cannot.
('8', 158, 1, 9, 382792) Bearing in mind then, that, in matters which do not detract from our self esteem, we must exercise judgment and care in dealing with the Government, I give below some rules [for the readers guidance] during the next three months and indeed for all time: 1. Every Indian should disregard self interest and think only in terms of the interests of the community as a whole.
('8', 158, 1, 10, 383163) 2. No one should use a false permit or encourage another to do so.
('8', 158, 1, 11, 383230) 3. No one should even think of arranging illegal entry for his relatives and friends.
('8', 158, 1, 12, 383316) 4. Correct particulars about names and ages of children should be furnished.
('8', 158, 1, 13, 383393) 5. The temptation to see a large number of Indians come in should be resisted.
('8', 158, 1, 14, 383472) 6. One must not be rude to the officials.
('8', 158, 1, 15, 383514) Not that we need flatter, but we must show respect.
('8', 158, 1, 16, 383566) 7. We should assume that all Indians will take out registers promptly.
('8', 158, 1, 17, 383637) 8. Most of the Indians should give their finger impressions in the conviction that there is no disgrace in doing so.
('8', 158, 1, 18, 383754) If these rules are observed, I make bold to say that whatever law is enacted will be mild and bearable enough and will be in keeping with our dignity.

('8', 159, 1, 2, 383989) 84. A BRIEF EXPLANATION 1
('8', 159, 2, 3, 384015) Everyone knows that this paper contains a good deal of my writing though a reader will normally be unable to say which articles are mine and which are by others.
('8', 159, 2, 4, 384177) I print this one under my signature so that the views put forward here may be specifically known to be mine.
('8', 159, 2, 5, 384286) The controversy over the compromise with the Government has now largely subsided.
('8', 159, 2, 6, 384368) There is a better appreciation of it among the people and, to that extent, they appear to have been pacified.
('8', 159, 2, 7, 384478) However, controversies continue.
('8', 159, 2, 8, 384511) I have received some deprecatory letters from Natal.
('8', 159, 2, 9, 384564) Some of them pour abuse on me, and this only shows the piti able state we are in.
('8', 159, 2, 10, 384646) The abuse has not had the slightest effect on my mind, but it indicates the extent to which feelings have been roused.
('8', 159, 2, 11, 384765) I also see that the objections some persons have to the com promise are only a pretext, their real intention being to set the Hindus and the Muslims at variance with each other.
('8', 159, 2, 12, 384943) I believe I have equal regard for the two communities.
('8', 159, 2, 13, 384998) In public service, Hindus and Mus lims have stood together as a united people.
('8', 159, 2, 14, 385077) It is not, I have noticed, the Hindus who have blamed me; they are presumably satisfied that the compromise is a reasonable one.
('8', 159, 2, 15, 385206) The condemnatory letters that I have received are all from Muslims.
('8', 159, 2, 16, 385274) It is necessary to go into the rea son.
('8', 159, 2, 17, 385314) I am reluctant even to write of this matter, but it would not be proper to keep back [from the readers] what is on the lips of many and has become a subject of talk.
('8', 159, 2, 18, 385480) Not only that; it may prove positively harmful to suppress the incident.
('8', 159, 2, 19, 385553) When the passive resistance movement was at its height, Mr. Ally 2 could not continue to trust me fully because I was a Hindu.
('8', 159, 3, 20, 385680) 1 This was published in Indian Opinion under the title A Letter from Mr. Gandhi.
('8', 159, 3, 21, 385761) 2 Haji Ojeer Ally; born in Mauritius in 1853 of Indian and Malay parents; spoke Dutch, English and Hindustani fluently (vide Satyagraha in South Africa, Ch. XIV); came to South Africa in 1884 and devoted himself whole heartedly to the Indian cause; took notable part in the agitation against Cape Franchise Law Amendment Act; elected Chairman, Cape Coloured Peoples Organization in 1892; founder President, Hamidia Islamic Society and member, along with Gandhiji, of the Transvaal Indian Deputation to England in 1906 (vide Vol. VI).
('8', 159, 3, 22, 386295) Unable to join satyagraha campaign and unwilling, at the same time, to submit to the Asiatic Registration Act, he left the Transvaal in 1907, leaving behind large interests; vide Johannesburg Letter, 31 8 1907
('8', 160, 0, 1, 386505) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 161
('8', 160, 1, 2, 386550) He therefore sent a telegram to Ameer Ali 1. On this occasion, a few Muslims thought of sending a telegram to Mr. Jinnah, and the Pathans eventually sent one.
('8', 160, 1, 3, 386709) I do not blame Mr. Ally for what he did.
('8', 160, 1, 4, 386750) Again, I do not blame the Pathans for what they have done now.
('8', 160, 1, 5, 386813) I have known Mr. Ameer Ali.
('8', 160, 1, 6, 386841) I asked for his help on behalf of the community and it was given.
('8', 160, 1, 7, 386907) I have also known Mr. Jinnah.
('8', 160, 1, 8, 386937) I regard them both with respect.
('8', 160, 1, 9, 386970) I do not therefore write to complain but only to point to these things as symptoms of our mental state.
('8', 160, 1, 10, 387074) The symptom is this: I occasionally observe some lack of trust [in me] though I have worked hard to bring the two communities together.
('8', 160, 1, 11, 387210) This is a sign of our weakness.
('8', 160, 1, 12, 387242) It makes me unhappy.
('8', 160, 1, 13, 387263) I have heard some Muslim brethren say in arguments about the compromise, Gandhi has totally ruined the Muslims and has been doing so for the last fifteen years. It is most regrettable that any Indian should utter these words.
('8', 160, 1, 14, 387489) I am sure those who say this themselves know that I have never even dreamt of harming anyone.
('8', 160, 1, 15, 387583) The entire campaign was intended to preserve the status of the well to do Indians.
('8', 160, 1, 16, 387666) Muslims are better placed in South Africa and it was chiefly a businessmens campaign.
('8', 160, 1, 17, 387752) Had it not been for the massive effort of the Hamidia Islamic Society, we would never have won.
('8', 160, 1, 18, 387848) Also, had not a large number of Muslims worked hard for it, there would have been no victory.
('8', 160, 1, 19, 387942) How can it be said then that I have brought utter ruin on the Muslims?
('8', 160, 1, 20, 388013) I know that there are only a few persons who say these things.
('8', 160, 1, 21, 388076) Most of the Muslims realize that in South Africa Hindus and Muslims make up a single [community] and ought to live together as one.
('8', 160, 1, 22, 388208) If I have done anyone harm, it must be to the community as a whole and not to the Muslims alone.
('8', 160, 1, 23, 388305) And I do not see that any harm has been done.
('8', 160, 1, 24, 388351) Yet people go on arguing.
('8', 160, 1, 25, 388377) I therefore wish to warn my Muslim brethren against those who are out to set people at variance with each other by saying these things; they ought to be treated as enemies of the community, and no one should take any notice of what they say.
('8', 160, 2, 26, 388619) 1 Syed Ameer Ali ( 1849 1928); Member, Judicial Committee of the Privy Council; Judge of Calcutta High Court, 1890 1904; author of Islam and books on Mahomedan Law, etc.
('8', 160, 2, 27, 388789) In July 1907, H.O. Ally wrote a letter to Ameer Ali, a member also of the South Africa British Indian Committee, expressing his opposition to Gandhijis continued campaign against the Asiatic Registration Act, for, he said, that would ruin thousands of my co religionists who are all traders while the Hindus are mostly hawkers.
('8', 160, 2, 28, 389117) He sought the intervention of the Committee against the satya graha movement.

('8', 161, 0, 1, 389225) 162 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 161, 1, 2, 389267) I would tell those who take pleasure in creating dissensions that they bring ruin not only upon themselves, but on the whole community.
('8', 161, 1, 3, 389403) They must stop this.
('8', 161, 1, 4, 389424) Let them give up considerations of mere self interest and turn their minds to doing good.
('8', 161, 1, 5, 389514) To the Hindu brethren I would say that all of us must live toge ther as one people, regardless of the things a few Muslims who are en emies of the community may say.
('8', 161, 1, 6, 389680) Looking at the matter in that light, they should give no thought to others mistakes.
('8', 161, 1, 7, 389765) They must not ans wer back.
('8', 161, 1, 8, 389793) There can be no quarrel unless both the sides are at fault.
('8', 161, 1, 9, 389853) Let them be careful, therefore, not to be in the wrong even partly.
('8', 161, 1, 10, 389921) In South Africa, I have only one duty: to bring the Hindus and the Muslims together and serve them as a single community.
('8', 161, 1, 11, 390043) Some questions have arisen in this connection.
('8', 161, 1, 12, 390090) We shall consider them next week.
('8', 161, 1, 13, 390124) Meanwhile I request every Indian to read this patiently several times over.

('8', 162, 1, 2, 390314) 85. LETTER TO GENERAL SMUTS 1
('8', 162, 2, 3, 390344) JOHANNESBURG, February 22, 1908
('8', 162, 3, 4, 390376) DEAR MR. SMUTS, In accordance with the permission given by you, I now take the opportunity of sending you a draft Bill 2 to amend Immigration Restriction Act No.
('8', 162, 3, 5, 390538) 15 of 1907. The draft, in my opinion, meets the situation entirely.
('8', 162, 3, 6, 390606) The time is ripe for me to submit it, inasmuch as there is every evidence now of the Asiatics loyally accepting the compromise.
('8', 162, 3, 7, 390734) You will see that some of the rights given by the Asiatic Act have not been availed of by the draft; for instance, Asiatics who were in the Transvaal on the 31st day of May, 1902 are, under the Act to be repealed, entitled to registration, whereas, under the draft now sub mitted, they are not.
('8', 162, 3, 8, 391029) I have omitted them advisedly, because it exposes Asiatics to temptation.
('8', 162, 3, 9, 391103) I have assumed that those who were in the Colony on the 31st day of May, 1902 must have by the time volun tary registration is completed availed themselves of it.
('8', 162, 3, 10, 391266) There could not be many outside the Colony who were in it on that day and have not yet returned.
('8', 162, 3, 11, 391363) If, however, there are any exceptional cases, they can bedealt with under the last clause of the amendment of Paragraph g.
('8', 162, 3, 12, 391486) On the other hand, I have ventured to specifically protect Asiatics who paid 3 to the old Government before the war, because, although they are not mentioned in Act 2 of 1907, it always was the intention to protect them, and holders of such certificates who are without the Colony cannot now number more than one hundred.
('8', 162, 3, 13, 391808) The clause about temporary permits has been taken over from Act 2 of 1907. I have ventured to import into the draft Bill a section dealing with the Church Street property 3 held by the late Aboobaker Amod.
('8', 162, 3, 14, 392014) As you are aware, the section in Act 2 of 1907 proved abor tive.
('8', 162, 3, 15, 392079) A section of that description may not appear in its place in an Immigration Bill but, as the law repeals the Asiatic Law Amendment Act, the relief sought to be granted under that Act might well be
('8', 162, 4, 16, 392276) 1 A copy of this letter to Smuts was also sent by Ritch as an annexure to his letter of July 27 to the Colonial Office.
('8', 162, 4, 17, 392396) In his reply dated March 12 (S. N. 4798), Lane wrote that General Smuts had his hands pretty full of other matters just then and had not yet had time to go into the question.

('8', 163, 1, 2, 392726) granted in a repealing Bill.
('8', 163, 1, 3, 392755) I am sure that you would be pleased to restore to the heirs ownership of their inheritance.
('8', 163, 1, 4, 392847) As you may be aware, the property is leased to a European firm and is being entirely used by Europeans and the building thereon is in every way a credit to the principal street of Pretoria.
('8', 163, 1, 5, 393037) I have omitted to take over from the Asiatic Act the section sup posed to give relief with reference to liquor.
('8', 163, 1, 6, 393149) I, personally, think that it is perfectly useless and should never have formed part of the Act.
('8', 163, 2, 7, 393245) I know that you are going to amend Section 6 also of the Immigration Restriction Act 2. I was almost going to submit a draft amendment, but, on second thoughts, I considered that it was not my place to do so.
('8', 163, 2, 8, 393454) May I, however, suggest that the power of removal be changed into authority to the Magistrate to convict persons who may disobey the order to leave and to imprison them until they would leave the Colony of their own accord and at their own expense.
('8', 163, 2, 9, 393703) I think that that is the utmost that a civilized Government can possibly do.
('8', 163, 2, 10, 393780) If Section 6 is amended in the manner above indicated, Section 11 and Sub Section f of Section 15 will require corresponding amendment.
('8', 163, 2, 11, 393916) There now remains for me to point out that, according to my reading of the Immigration Restriction Act, Malays and Cape Coloured people become prohibited immigrants.
('8', 163, 2, 12, 394082) I hardly think that such was the intention of the Government.
('8', 163, 2, 13, 394144) I should imagine that they would be protected the same as descendants of the aboriginal races of Africa, as per clause h of Section 2. In my opinion, no further amendments would be necessary in order to carry out the main purpose of the Asiatic Act in the way of inspection and in the way of restriction of licences only to those who are not prohibited immigrants, because both these are already more than provided for under the Immigration Restriction Act.
('8', 163, 2, 14, 394602) Every per son applying for a licence will have to prove that he is not a prohi bited immigrant and the officers appointed under the Immigration Restriction Act will have the power to put to proof any person sus pected of being a prohibited immigrant.
('8', 163, 2, 15, 394853) If there are any Asiatics who do not avail themselves of the voluntary offer, I do not think, in view of the amendment suggested by me, that you require the use of the Asiatic Act to deal with them, because they will ipso facto become prohibited immigrants and would, therefore, be liable to an expulsion order.

('8', 165, 4, 6, 397966) The Blue book published by Lord Elgin 1 in January is now available in South Africa.
('8', 165, 4, 7, 398051) It is called a Blue book, though it should really be called a black book.
('8', 165, 4, 8, 398125) Anyone who reads this Blue book and follows it will soon realize that the Indians success was in spite of the Imperial Government, which had ranged itself on the other side; it was won entirely on the strength of truth.
('8', 165, 4, 9, 398345) It appears that, until January 10, the attitude of the Imperial Government was a feeble one.
('8', 165, 4, 10, 398438) We have seen how it changed after that date.
('8', 165, 4, 11, 398483) But we do not have to be grateful to the Imperial Government for that.
('8', 165, 4, 12, 398554) For them it was a good deed done under the stress [of circumstances].
('8', 165, 4, 13, 398624) We see from the Blue book that, if the Immigrants[Restriction] Act remains in its present form, sub section 4 of section 2 of the Act 2, as interpreted by the Government, will preclude the entry of any Indian residing outside the Transvaal.
('8', 165, 4, 14, 398865) If this interpretation of the Act is correct, it is all the more clear how valuable has been our success.
('8', 165, 4, 15, 398971) At the same time we must realize that, if the Governments interpretation of the immigration Act is correct, even Indians who pass the education test cannot enter.
('8', 165, 4, 16, 399134) If the Indian community acquits itself well during the [next] three months, this fear will very likely prove to have been without basis.
('8', 165, 4, 17, 399271) For the present, however, the first comment we have to make on the Blue book is this: though the immigration Act admitted of this insidious interpretation, Lord Elgin acquiesced in it.
('8', 165, 4, 18, 399456) Likewise, he also acquiesced in section 6, which provides for the deportation of Indians on the plea of the Asiatic [Registration] Act having received Royal

('8', 166, 1, 2, 400038) assent.
('8', 166, 1, 3, 400046) The Colonial Government should, therefore, be granted the powers required to enforce that Act and to deport the satyagrahis.
('8', 166, 1, 4, 400171) Mr. Morley 1, too, acquiesced in this after some hesitation, being satisfied with Mr. Smuts assurance given him and Lord Elgin that [Indian] Princes and other [dignitaries] would be given the necessary permits for visits.
('8', 166, 1, 5, 400393) The whole affair is as much a disgrace to the Indian community as it is to the British Empire.
('8', 166, 1, 6, 400488) The British rulers take us to be so lowly and ignorant that they assume that, like the Kaffirs 2 who can be pleased with toys and pins, we can also be fobbed off with trinkets.
('8', 166, 1, 7, 400665) It is a tribute to the marvellous power of truthbe it noted by the Indiansthat our rulers who thought us despicable were forced to change their opinion when they saw 200 Indians in gaol.
('8', 166, 1, 8, 400852) We also learn from the same Blue book that the Chinese Consul, having raised the question of finger impressions, found it necessary to withdraw it in view of the petition by the Chinese Association, and to tell Sir Edward Grey later that the [Chinese] objection was really to the Act itself [and not just to the finger impressions].
('8', 166, 1, 9, 401185) We earnestly hope that the Indian community will not throw away, through a mistaken step or sheer thoughtlessness, the success that has been gained after such strenuouseffort.
('8', 166, 1, 10, 401361) When we have more time, we shall place before our readers the translations of relevant portions of this Blue book so that they may have the same picture of it as we have in our mind.
('8', 166, 1, 11, 401544) Meanwhile, the only request we make is that they should remember that the movement has a long way to go yet and that these three months have been granted to us for finalizing our preparations and sharpening our weapons.
('8', 166, 1, 12, 401764) If we make the mistake of supposing that we cannot again put up the same kind of fight, we shall to our regret lose even that which we have gained.
('8', 166, 1, 13, 401912) Those who wish India well must ponder over this.
('8', 166, 1, 14, 401961) They ought not toallow their character patience, endurance, generosity, industrious ness, etc.to desert them.

('8', 167, 2, 3, 402772) We must do something for Mr. Ritch without losing time.
('8', 167, 2, 4, 402828) He has done invaluable work.
('8', 167, 2, 5, 402857) We think it will be a great sin if the community fails in doing its duty by him.
('8', 167, 2, 6, 402938) There are very few [persons] to be found even among Indians, let alone the whites, who have Mr. Ritchs perseverance and single mindedness.
('8', 167, 2, 7, 403077) We hope both the poor and the rich will contribute to the best of their means.
('8', 167, 2, 8, 403156) We will publish the name of every contributor.
('8', 167, 2, 9, 403203) No one should take cover behind what another does.
('8', 167, 2, 10, 403254) We must not wait for another to make a beginning.
('8', 167, 2, 11, 403304) In matters like these everyone should be ready to make a beginning himself.
('8', 167, 2, 12, 403380) Nowadays we do not publish translations of letters from Mr. Ritch often enough although they are now particularly long.
('8', 167, 2, 13, 403500) We already know the results of the developments he mentions.
('8', 167, 2, 14, 403561) Attaching as we do more importance to other current matters, we either omit his letters or abridge them.

('8', 167, 4, 17, 403722) A reader from Durban writes to say that many of us are in the habit of referring to Indians from Calcutta or Madras, in public as well as in private, as coolya or coolie.
('8', 167, 4, 18, 403893) The complaint appears to be justified.
('8', 167, 4, 19, 403932) We have often heard well bred Indians use such terms.
('8', 167, 4, 20, 403986) We are annoyed when Mr. Smuts or other whites use the word coolie, but ourselves frequently use the same word deliberately or unwit tingly, referring to persons from Calcutta or Madras who may not be labourers.
('8', 167, 4, 21, 404197) The correspondent informs us that he once heard an Indian businessman refer to a person from Calcutta as a coolie in the presence of a lawyer.
('8', 167, 4, 22, 404340) We hope that every Indian who has this habit will give it up, if only because such behaviour stands in the way of bringing all the Indians together.

('8', 168, 2, 3, 404670) REGISTRATION
('8', 168, 3, 4, 404683) Registration is going on apace.
('8', 168, 3, 5, 404715) The officials are not able to attend to all the Indians who turn up.
('8', 168, 3, 6, 404784) They cannot manage more than 200 applications a day.
('8', 168, 3, 7, 404837) Since all the officials are fully occupied in Johannesburg, it has not been possible to move the office to other towns.
('8', 168, 3, 8, 404957) But it is likely that by the middle of March the office will have visited all the other towns.
('8', 168, 4, 9, 405052) THE CHINESE
('8', 168, 5, 10, 405064) There arose a further misunderstanding about registration certi ficates for the Chinese.
('8', 168, 5, 11, 405153) Mr. Chamney told Mr. Quinn that it was not right that all the Chinese should give their thumb impressions only.
('8', 168, 5, 12, 405265) Mr. Gandhi then found it necessary to intervene, and it was eventually agreed that the Chinese who reported might give their thumb impres sions only.
('8', 168, 5, 13, 405415) The more the Chinese persist in such childish obstinacy, the more they lose their good name.
('8', 168, 5, 14, 405508) The Indians readily go to the Office and furnish their finger impressions, and this wins for them an increasing appreciation of their nobility and gentleness.
('8', 168, 5, 15, 405667) About 95 per cent.
('8', 168, 5, 16, 405686) of the Indians have already given their finger impressions.
('8', 168, 5, 17, 405746) About five per cent.
('8', 168, 5, 18, 405767) probably gave only their thumb impressions.
('8', 168, 5, 19, 405811) True bravery implies humility and gentleness.
('8', 168, 5, 20, 405857) We find the most fear less per sons appear calm and gentle.
('8', 168, 5, 21, 405917) The famous General Gordon 1 was ordinarily mild as a lamb, kind hearted and gentle in his dealings,and alto gether without a trace of rudeness about him.
('8', 168, 5, 22, 406071) Even children could talk to him freely.
('8', 168, 5, 23, 406111) The same person roared like a lion when his honour was at stake.
('8', 168, 6, 24, 406176) STORY OF FINGER IMPRESSIONS
('8', 168, 7, 25, 406204) I feel ashamed for the community that I should still have to write about finger impressions.
('8', 168, 7, 26, 406297) The point is so simple that it is difficult to understand why it is still being argued.
('8', 168, 7, 27, 406385) But the late Profe ssor Max Muller said that as long as truth is not effectively impressed on the mind of the other, there is nothing wrong in repeating the same thing over and over again in different words.
('8', 168, 7, 28, 406593) It is indeed necessary to do so.
('8', 168, 7, 29, 406626) Besides, there are some mischief mongers among us who want
('8', 168, 8, 30, 406685) 1 Charles George Gordon (1833 85); British soldier and administrator; served in the Crimean War and later with distinction in China (hence Chinese Gordon) and Egypt; was Governor General of the Sudan; died defending Khartoum against the Mahdi's forces.
('8', 169, 0, 1, 406938) 170 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 169, 1, 2, 406980) to see troublein the community.
('8', 169, 1, 3, 407012) In order to counter the arguments of such persons from time to time and thus prevent sincere but simp leminded Indians from wavering, it is necessary to put down every idea that occurs to one.
('8', 169, 1, 4, 407205) I can see indications that in the end digit impressions will be introduced all over South Africamaybe ten, maybe eighteen of themalthough, of course, I do not see why that should frighten us.
('8', 169, 1, 5, 407397) The immigration Act has been in force in the Transvaal since January 1. It has not yet been possible to enforce it against Indians, for their campaign has been directed against regis tration itself.
('8', 169, 1, 6, 407596) Under that law, there are four different kinds of passes to be taken out.
('8', 169, 1, 7, 407670) In the first place, under the law, even a person who, by virtue of being an old resident, is entitled to return to the Colony [after temporary absence] is required to have a pass; he may, however, find it difficult to return for want of proficiency in a European language.
('8', 169, 1, 8, 407943) Such passes will rarely be necessary for Indians as they will have their registration certificates with them.
('8', 169, 1, 9, 408053) But they will be required of whites Jews and othersbelonging to the working class, for it may happen that they do not know English and that some of them do not have 20 in cash.
('8', 169, 1, 10, 408230) On one side this pass will carry particulars about the holder, such as his name, address, and on the other his ten finger impressions.
('8', 169, 1, 11, 408365) That is, the position is for them the same as that obtaining for Indians today.
('8', 169, 1, 12, 408445) The only difference is that the Indians have to affix their finger impressions on the application only, not on their passes.
('8', 169, 1, 13, 408570) But the [other kind of] passes referred to earlier will bear the ten finger impressions [of the holder] and will have to be produced often.
('8', 169, 1, 14, 408710) The second kind of pass is meant for new immigrants under the same law.
('8', 169, 1, 15, 408782) It is intended mostly for Jews, for they will not be able to take the test at Volksrust easily.
('8', 169, 1, 16, 408878) Moreover, there are no Yiddish kno wing officials at the border.
('8', 169, 1, 17, 408943) Arrangements have been made for issuingpasses to such persons at the port or in England itself.
('8', 169, 1, 18, 409039) This pass, like the first, will bear impressions of all the ten fingers.
('8', 169, 1, 19, 409112) The third kind of pass is in the nature of a permit which may be issued to anyone for a limited period.
('8', 169, 1, 20, 409216) It will also bear ten finger imp ressions.
('8', 169, 1, 21, 409259) The fourth is meant for witnesses who may be allowed into the Transvaal but who cannot take the test.
('8', 169, 1, 22, 409361) This will also bear ten finger impressions.
('8', 169, 1, 23, 409405) There are thus four kinds of passes [to be had against] varying fees, of which two categories are such as will most likely apply only to the whites.
('8', 169, 1, 24, 409554) [The system of] finger impressions has been introduced for these passes.
('8', 169, 1, 25, 409627) How can the Indian community then protest against
('8', 170, 0, 1, 409677) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 171
('8', 170, 1, 2, 409722) finger impressions?
('8', 170, 1, 3, 409742) It is to be observed moreover that the whites do not oppose these regulations at all.
('8', 170, 1, 4, 409828) The reason is worth noting.
('8', 170, 1, 5, 409856) The whites are free and independent.
('8', 170, 1, 6, 409893) They do not get scared unneces sarily, neither do they see humiliation where in fact there is none.
('8', 170, 1, 7, 409993) And for the same reason they do not feel that finger impressions by themselves imply criminality.
('8', 170, 1, 8, 410091) The fact is that for the identification [of pass holders] and for the prevention of fraud, digit impressions offer a simple, effective and scientific means.
('8', 170, 1, 9, 410248) It is true that this method was at first applied only to criminals.
('8', 170, 1, 10, 410316) That is the reason why, when the method was sought to be applied particularly to Indians under compulsion, we opposed it and were justified in doing so.
('8', 170, 1, 11, 410469) But there is no reason to oppose it now.
('8', 170, 1, 12, 410510) Many reforms have been adopted after they were first tried out on criminals; for instance, vaccination with cow pox serum.
('8', 170, 1, 13, 410633) When Mr. Jenner discovered this method of vaccination, he first tried it on prisoners.
('8', 170, 1, 14, 410720) It was introduced among the rest of the population after the experiment had proved successful.
('8', 170, 1, 15, 410815) No one could argue that the free population was thereby humiliated.
('8', 170, 1, 16, 410883) If anyone wants to know why all these arguments were not adva nced earlier, it is easy to answer the question.
('8', 170, 1, 17, 410994) Formerly, finger prints were a part of an enslaving law and therefore a symbol of our slavery.
('8', 170, 1, 18, 411089) It was thus our duty to draw attention to the humiliating aspect of [giving] finger impressions.
('8', 170, 1, 19, 411186) It was then no part of this journals intention to help [the Government] to dress the Indian community in a cloak of slavery by arguing that finger impressions were bound to be introduced in the end, or that the method had advantages from a scientific point of view.
('8', 170, 1, 20, 411452) There was no need, therefore, at that time to argue that in a certain context it would become necessary to give finger impressions, or that there should be no objection to [giving] them.
('8', 170, 1, 21, 411639) That was at a time when it was necessary to present a strong case against the law.
('8', 170, 1, 22, 411722) All the arguments advanced at that time either in my news letters or elsewhere in this paper were valid.
('8', 170, 1, 23, 411827) Even today, given an identical situation, they would be absolutely valid.
('8', 170, 1, 24, 411901) If anywhere in the world they should introduce the [system of] compulsory finger imp ressions, or even a thumb impression for the Indian community alone, with the object of stigmatizing it for the colour of its skin, this journal will again take up the banner and repeat the arguments used in the past.
('8', 170, 1, 25, 412204) Besides, everyone must know that we have always said that our campaign was not directed against finger impressions as such but against the law.
('8', 170, 1, 26, 412348) The repeal of the law being assured, the Indian sword returned, on its own as it were, to the scabbard.
('8', 170, 2, 27, 412452) ABOUT LICENCES
('8', 170, 3, 28, 412467) For a variety of reasons it has now been arranged that those who
('8', 171, 0, 1, 412532) 172 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 171, 1, 2, 412574) have taken out registration certificates of their own accord should have licences issued to them even before a new law is passed.
('8', 171, 1, 3, 412704) It will be stated on the licences that they are being issued subject to the approval by Parliament of [the principle of] voluntary registration.
('8', 171, 1, 4, 412849) This is a more satisfactory arrangement than the issuing of conditional receipts, and is an earnest of the Governments intention fully to honour its commitment to the Indian community.
('8', 171, 2, 5, 413034) MAY 31, 1902
('8', 171, 3, 6, 413047) Questions have often been raised about the column in the application form calling for information about the applicants whereabouts on May 31 [1902].
('8', 171, 3, 7, 413196) It is in the interests of the Indian community that this information is sought, for those who were in the Transvaal on May 31, 1902 can be registered even in the absence of a permit or other similar evidence.
('8', 171, 4, 8, 413405) WILL VOLUNTARY REGISTRANTS BE SUBJECT TO EXISTING LAW ?
('8', 171, 5, 9, 413461) There should have been no need to ask this question.
('8', 171, 5, 10, 413514) There exists a written understanding with General Smuts that those who take out registers of their own accord will not be subject to the law, even if there should be a few such Indians.
('8', 171, 6, 11, 413700) NEW ENTRANTS
('8', 171, 7, 12, 413713) A question has also been asked whether fresh entrants into the Transvaal will be allowed in.
('8', 171, 7, 13, 413806) I think those who pass the education test under the immigration law should be able to come in.
('8', 171, 7, 14, 413901) However, the Blue book received from England recently shows that, according to the interpretation put upon sub section 4 of section 2 of the immi gration Act, even educated people cannot enter.
('8', 171, 7, 15, 414095) 2 I do not myself accept this view, neither does Mr. Gregorowski 3. If the proposed law incorporates amendments which I should like, it will no longer be possible to argue that sub section 4 admits of two interpretations.
('8', 171, 7, 16, 414317) Whatever the correct interpretation, I would strongly advise the inten ding Indian immigrants and permitless refugee Indians not to think of entering the Transvaal for the present.
('8', 171, 7, 17, 414498) The first duty of the Indian community is to prove its worth and its honesty whithin three months.
('8', 171, 7, 18, 414597) We shall see about the other things afterwards.
('8', 171, 7, 19, 414645) If any educated per sons or refugees want to enter the Transvaal at present, I am sure that it will only harm [the cause of] the community.
('8', 171, 7, 20, 414785) Durban has been of great help in this struggle, and I hope that it will continue working

('8', 172, 2, 3, 415132) VOLKSRUST INDIANS
('8', 172, 3, 4, 415150) In January, the Volksrust Committee sent the Association a sum of 7 telegraphically which was made up of contributions from thefollowing persons: Mr. Mahomed Suleman, 3; Messrs Hoosen Suleman & Co.
('8', 172, 3, 5, 415348) (Parakh) 2 Messrs Suleman Moosaji Mungera, Ebra him Mahomed Jadavat and Moosa Suleman, 10s each; Messrs Asmal Ahmed of Kanam and Ahmed Ebrahim Hasrod, 5s each; total 7. This should have been reported earlier, and I am sorry that it could not be.
('8', 172, 4, 6, 415594) NEW REGISTER
('8', 172, 5, 7, 415607) The new registration certificate will contain the following parti culars: name, community, age, height, external mark of identification, the Registrars signature, date of [issue of] the certificate, signature of the person registered, and the right thumb impression.
('8', 172, 5, 8, 415874) Then follow below name of wife, address, and the names, ages, address and rela tionship [to applicant] of children under sixteen years of age and of minors of the same age.
('8', 172, 5, 9, 416047) This register is altogether different from the one issued under the new law.
('8', 172, 5, 10, 416124) The wifes name found a place in the old register 1, and harassment of women can be obviated if the name is mentioned.
('8', 172, 5, 11, 416242) This register makes no reference to the new law.
('8', 172, 5, 12, 416291) Registers taken out voluntarily will be numbered serially beginning with one.
('8', 172, 6, 13, 416369) FINGER PRINTS FROM WOMEN
('8', 172, 7, 14, 416394) It is reported from Volksrust that officials demand thumb impressions of Indian women, and the latter give these.
('8', 172, 7, 15, 416508) What is more, the women give thumb impressions and refuse to lodge complaints.
('8', 172, 7, 16, 416587) We have thus lost many rights through fear.
('8', 172, 7, 17, 416631) For myself I would rather that women were not subjected to such harassment.
('8', 172, 7, 18, 416707) Even white women have to give their finger impressions, to say nothing of thumb imp ressions.
('8', 172, 7, 19, 416801) There is good reason for this: a large number of white women of questionable reputation come in.
('8', 172, 7, 20, 416898) No such charge has been made against Indian women in the Transvaal.
('8', 172, 7, 21, 416966) I believe, therefore, that, if the Indian community shows some pluck in dealing with the matter, Indian women may be spared the harassment of interrogation.
('8', 172, 7, 22, 417123) I hope that this point will be borne in mind and that all such cases will be reported without fail to the Association.

('8', 173, 1, 2, 417313) PIETERSBURG GAOL
('8', 173, 2, 3, 417330) Writing about the experiences of Indians who went to gaol in Pietersburg in connection with the law, Mr. Khanderia tells us that they were all kept together in gaol.
('8', 173, 2, 4, 417496) The arrangements were good.
('8', 173, 2, 5, 417524) The meals consisted of pulses, rice, vegetables and ghee.
('8', 173, 2, 6, 417582) The Magistrate being very kind, the prisoners were permitted to write letters.
('8', 173, 2, 7, 417661) Once a week they could also have a visitor [each] in connection with their business.
('8', 173, 2, 8, 417746) The gaoler, too, was kind.
('8', 173, 2, 9, 417773) Mr. Bhayats manager and Mr. Abdool Latief visited the gaol once.
('8', 173, 2, 10, 417838) I had always thought that Indians would not have difficulties in mofussil gaols, for the freedom that one has in a village gaol can never be had in city gaols, such as those in Johannesburg, Pretoria, etc.
('8', 173, 2, 11, 418044) If we hope to achieve much in the future, we shall have frequent occasions to go to gaol.
('8', 173, 2, 12, 418134) It is therefore necessary to note such facts.
('8', 173, 3, 13, 418180) MEETING OF ASSOCIATION
('8', 173, 4, 14, 418203) A meeting of the British Indian Association took place on Friday, the 21st.
('8', 173, 4, 15, 418279) A large number of Indians were present.
('8', 173, 4, 16, 418319) After some discussion, it was resolved, at the instance of Mr. Imam Abdool Kadir, who was supported by Mr. Thambi Naidoo, to try and send Mr. Ritch a sum of 300 at the least as a mark of our appreciation for his work, and if necessary, to draw upon the funds of the Association for this purpose to the extent of 100. 1 [It was further resolved] to send addresses to Lord Ampthill and Sir Muncherjee Bhownaggree at a cost of up to 25, to give a gift of about 50 in value to Mr. Polak, 10 or more to Miss Schlesin, 10 to Mr. Isaac 2, 10 to Mr. Curtis and also [send gifts] to others who had rendered appreciable help in fur thering the movement.
('8', 173, 4, 17, 418963) It was also decided at the same meeting to give a dinner to Mr. Cartwright, Mr. Phillips, Mr. Doke and a few others.
('8', 173, 4, 18, 419080) Tickets priced at two guineas each will be issued for the dinner.
('8', 173, 4, 19, 419146) It is hoped that about 30 Indians will buy tickets.
('8', 173, 4, 20, 419198) The proceeds will be spent on the dinner, to which 20 whites will be invited.
('8', 173, 4, 21, 419276) If the idea works, this will perhaps be the first instance in South Africa of so many Indians and whites coming together at a party.
('8', 173, 4, 22, 419409) In passing the resolution about expressing, in concrete terms, our appreciation [of the help received], I think the Indian community

('8', 174, 1, 2, 420027) has only done its duty.
('8', 174, 1, 3, 420051) The whites who helped did so sincerely, without any expectation of reward.
('8', 174, 1, 4, 420126) The Chinese Association, too, will pass a similar resolution.
('8', 174, 1, 5, 420188) As for Mr. Ritch, I hope that a tidy amount will be collected exclusively for him and that the reserve fund of the Association will not have to be drawn upon.
('8', 174, 1, 6, 420347) Mr. Ritchs services have been such that no Indian should hesitate to contribute his mite.
('8', 174, 2, 7, 420437) SUGGESTION
('8', 174, 3, 8, 420448) At present there is such heavy pressure on the Registration Office from the Johannesburg Indians alone that preferably only those Indiansfrom outside the city, who are in a hurry to leave for India, should come here [for purposes of registration]; the rest will have time enough later.
('8', 174, 4, 9, 420734) HAWKERS AND PEDLARS
('8', 174, 5, 10, 420754) Many of them do not understand the difference between a hawker and a pedlar, and needlessly pay more money to take out a hawkers licence.
('8', 174, 5, 11, 420892) Anyone who plies his goods in a horse drawn carriage is a hawker and anyone who uses a barrow or a basket is a pedlar.
('8', 174, 5, 12, 421011) The pedlars licence costs only 3, whereas a hawkers licence costs 5. [From Gujarati] Indian Opinion, 29 2 1908
('8', 174, 6, 13, 421122) 90. FURTHER CONSIDERATIONS 1
('8', 174, 7, 14, 421151) I wrote last week of the real issues underlying the controversy that is raging over the compromise.
('8', 174, 7, 15, 421251) 2 I promised then to write again.
('8', 174, 7, 16, 421285) Even an emperor cannot bring round those who are bent on mischief directed against the community.
('8', 174, 7, 17, 421383) How then can I, a poor man, hope to do so?
('8', 174, 7, 18, 421426) My effort is directed only towards those who harbour no mischievous intent, but who are likely to be misled by others.
('8', 174, 8, 19, 421545) WHY DID I NOT CONSULT OTHERS ?
('8', 174, 9, 20, 421576) This question is often raised, and I have already answered it.
('8', 174, 9, 21, 421639) The letter 3 which I am said to have signed without consulting others was not explicit on the question of finger impressions.
('8', 174, 9, 22, 421765) My meeting with General Smuts was followed by a largely attended meeting 4 of
('8', 174, 10, 23, 421843) 1 This was published under the title Another Letter from Mr. Gandhi.
('8', 174, 10, 24, 421912) 2 Vide Letter to Friends,10 2 1908 and A Brief Explanation, 22 2 1908 3 Vide Letter to Colonial Secretary, 28 1 1908 4 The Press refrained, at the instance of the conveners, from publishing reports of this meeting.
('8', 175, 0, 1, 422127) 176 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 175, 1, 2, 422169) Indians at midnight.
('8', 175, 1, 3, 422190) I put the question of finger prints before the meeting, and all the Indian leaders who were present authorized me to agree to the proposal.
('8', 175, 1, 4, 422330) Shahji was the only one who opposed it.
('8', 175, 1, 5, 422370) When I met Mr. Smuts the following Monday, I was thus fully aware of the peoples views.
('8', 175, 1, 6, 422458) I had also in mind the messages I had received from the leaders while I was in gaol.
('8', 175, 1, 7, 422543) I had kept myself fully informed of the real difficulties of the people and the state of their mind.
('8', 175, 2, 8, 422644) I DID NOT SHOW PATIENCE
('8', 175, 3, 9, 422668) Some persons believe that since I was in gaol I was not posted with the developments in England.
('8', 175, 3, 10, 422765) It would have been, they argue, a very good thing if I had waited a little longer.
('8', 175, 3, 11, 422848) This again is not true.
('8', 175, 3, 12, 422872) While in gaol I was kept posted with all the information.
('8', 175, 3, 13, 422930) Even if I had notbeen, I had already predicted what would happen in England.
('8', 175, 3, 14, 423007) I have not therefore acted in ignorance.
('8', 175, 3, 15, 423048) We stood to gain nothing by waiting longer than we did, for it is not as if we had agreed to finger impressions under pressure.
('8', 175, 3, 16, 423176) It was because of our offer of voluntary registration that we received support in England.
('8', 175, 3, 17, 423267) If I had lost any time when the offer came from the Government, it would have cost us the sympathy we got in England.
('8', 175, 3, 18, 423385) Let us remember that there were elderlyand respectable businessmen who were to go to gaol the day following that of the compromise.
('8', 175, 3, 19, 423517) The thought was gnawing at my heart.
('8', 175, 3, 20, 423554) I saw that it was my duty to prevent this from happening if I could.
('8', 175, 3, 21, 423623) It is therefore wrong to speak of undue haste on my part.
('8', 175, 3, 22, 423681) Moreover, those who followed me to gaol had rather discoura ging reports to give.
('8', 175, 3, 23, 423763) They told me that people were losing courage.
('8', 175, 3, 24, 423809) The hawkers, they told me, had stopped going their rounds.
('8', 175, 3, 25, 423868) They wanted me to bring about a compromise as early as possible.
('8', 175, 3, 26, 423933) Those who went to gaol lost their nerve in a few days, and some of them hinted that they would not go to gaol again.
('8', 175, 3, 27, 424050) General Smuts told me much the same thing when I met him: that I did not have the slightest idea of the number of people who had wanted to submit to the law.
('8', 175, 3, 28, 424208) A few people had already sent applications to him in secret.
('8', 175, 3, 29, 424269) I even know the names of some of them.
('8', 175, 3, 30, 424308) All these things could not just be ignored by a person who had been deeply involved in the struggle for 16 months.
('8', 175, 3, 31, 424423) However, if I had seen any objection to finger impressions, or if I had even known that Indians in the Transvaal would be extremely unhappy about having to give their finger impressions, there would perhaps have been some reason for further deliberation.
('8', 175, 3, 32, 424678) But, as far as I could judge, there was no objection to the voluntary provision of finger impressions just as there was none to voluntary registration;
('8', 176, 0, 1, 424830) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 177
('8', 176, 1, 2, 424875) and I knew that sensible persons in the Transvaal were not opposed to the idea, for they had no objection to finger impressions as such, but only to the manner in which they were [required] to give them under the law.
('8', 176, 1, 3, 425093) Since that situation no longer obtained, finger impressions in themselves had become innocuous.
('8', 176, 2, 4, 425189) DID I LOSE COURAGE IN GAOL?
('8', 176, 3, 5, 425217) People who accuse me [thus] do not know me at all.
('8', 176, 3, 6, 425268) If there was one person who enjoyed being in gaol, it was I. I did not find anyone else as content to be in gaol as I was.
('8', 176, 3, 7, 425391) I should welcome gaol again if the occasion demanded it; so sure am I of myself.
('8', 176, 4, 8, 425472) POINT IN GIVING FINGER IMPRESSIONS
('8', 176, 5, 9, 425507) Some people want to know what I mean when I say that it is advantageous for us to give our finger impressions.
('8', 176, 5, 10, 425618) Let me mention some of the reasons.
('8', 176, 5, 11, 425654) By agreeing to give our finger impressions we have only shown our good sense and proved that the campaign was not against these.
('8', 176, 5, 12, 425783) 2. I thought it wise to satisfy the Government on a matter such as this.
('8', 176, 5, 13, 425856) Experience has confirmed the view.
('8', 176, 5, 14, 425891) 3. If we had not agreed now to give the finger impressions, we would have later been compelled to give them.
('8', 176, 5, 15, 426000) Whether or not we would have given them then is another question.
('8', 176, 5, 16, 426066) 4. Several clauses of the immigration Act provide for the taking of whites finger impressions.
('8', 176, 5, 17, 426161) 5. I think I acted honestly in giving my finger impressions.
('8', 176, 5, 18, 426222) I have therefore made good my pledge and shown that I was not cowed down by the Pathans assault.
('8', 176, 5, 19, 426319) I have also forestalled the charge that I had so contrived things as not to have to give my own finger impressions.
('8', 176, 5, 20, 426435) 6. This [arrangement] safeguards the interests of many poor people.
('8', 176, 5, 21, 426503) 7. It has added to the prestige of the Indian community, and several whites have now become ardent friends of the community.
('8', 176, 6, 22, 426628) HOW CHINESE MANAGED TO ESCAPE
('8', 176, 7, 23, 426658) Some people argue that the Chinese fought and so managed things that they had to give no more than a thumb impression.
('8', 176, 7, 24, 426777) This is a mistaken view.
('8', 176, 7, 25, 426802) It is the British Indian Association that is responsible for having had them exempted.
('8', 176, 7, 26, 426889) I intervened in the matter and sent a message to Mr. Smuts from bed.
('8', 176, 7, 27, 426958) It is therefore a part of the compro 
('8', 177, 0, 1, 426996) 178 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 177, 1, 2, 427038) mise that the Chinese will give their thumb impressions only.
('8', 177, 1, 3, 427100) We could have done what the Chinese have done.
('8', 177, 1, 4, 427147) But, by their obstinacy, the Chinese have lost their good name with the Government, whereas we have retained ours.
('8', 177, 1, 5, 427262) Not only that; a situation has arisen in which, if the Indian community wanted it, the Government might single out the Chinese [for differential treatment].
('8', 177, 1, 6, 427419) We are not the people to attempt anything of the kind.
('8', 177, 1, 7, 427474) The thoughtful among the Chinese realize this, and that is why they have been voluntarily giving their finger impres sions.
('8', 177, 1, 8, 427598) Mr. Quinn has already given his.
('8', 177, 2, 9, 427631) VOLUNTARY VERSUS COMPULSORY
('8', 177, 3, 10, 427659) In this connection, a patriotic worker has cited an excellent ana logy for the benefit of our Muslim brethren.
('8', 177, 3, 11, 427770) According to the Koran it is permissible to eat the flesh of an animal slaughtered in the name of God, but not otherwise.
('8', 177, 3, 12, 427892) Similarly, it is legitimate to give finger impressions voluntarily, but it was not so when they were compulsory.
('8', 177, 4, 13, 428005) HAVE EDUCATED FOUND IT PROFITABLE ARRANGEMENT ?
('8', 177, 5, 14, 428053) This question can only come from sheer lack of understanding.
('8', 177, 5, 15, 428115) Those who are really educated are bound always to have an advant ageover others.
('8', 177, 5, 16, 428196) If that were not so, there should be no need of edu cation.
('8', 177, 5, 17, 428256) Those who have not themselves had any education should rea lize that, if the educated prosper, the entire community stands to gain.
('8', 177, 5, 18, 428388) It may be that the educated persons do not always prove themselves worthy.
('8', 177, 5, 19, 428463) Besides, what do we mean when we speak of a profitable arrangement?
('8', 177, 5, 20, 428531) What special advantage is to be had from either giving or not giving finger impressions?
('8', 177, 5, 21, 428620) The educated persons may sign their names while the uneducated only put a cross.
('8', 177, 5, 22, 428701) What is the special advantage in either arrangement ?
('8', 177, 5, 23, 428755) In fact our object should be to safeguard the rights of as many as possible.
('8', 177, 5, 24, 428832) It is degrading to feel envious without cause; indeed it is cowardly.
('8', 177, 5, 25, 428902) Let us remember that only if there is water in the well will there be any in the trough, and in that belief, we should encourage education.
('8', 177, 5, 26, 429042) [Instead of envying others,] we should aspire for the same thing for ourselves.
('8', 177, 5, 27, 429122) We should realize the value of education and help it to spread.
('8', 177, 6, 28, 429186) REAL SIGNIFICANCE OF LAW
('8', 177, 7, 29, 429211) What is the really objectionable feature of the law?
('8', 177, 7, 30, 429264) If someone asked me this question, I should first say that it was a mystery which could not be easily explained.
('8', 177, 7, 31, 429377) We feel the air through its effects but cannot see it.
('8', 177, 7, 32, 429432) We smell the fragrance of flowers, but cannot see it.
('8', 177, 7, 33, 429486) Having called on someone, I can only say whether I was treated court eously or discourteously, but often cannot point to anything specific

('8', 178, 1, 2, 429670) indicating either.
('8', 178, 1, 3, 429689) There may be two pearls, one genuine and the other false.
('8', 178, 1, 4, 429747) Only an expert can tell between the two, and we would respect his judgment.
('8', 178, 1, 5, 429823) I think experience has made me something of an expert about laws.
('8', 178, 1, 6, 429889) When I read this outrageous law, my hair stood on end, and I felt there was something wrong about it.
('8', 178, 1, 7, 429991) The law was so drafted as to make slaves of us.
('8', 178, 1, 8, 430039) It was to be the harbinger of other disabilities to come.
('8', 178, 1, 9, 430097) If the law had come to stay, it would have ruined us every where.
('8', 178, 1, 10, 430163) They passed the law in spite of our protest, treating the entire community as criminally inclined.
('8', 178, 1, 11, 430262) Even if we had stood to gain hundreds of thousands of rupees by deferring to the law, it would have been contemptible of us to have taken the money.
('8', 178, 1, 12, 430411) If people outside this country read the law, they would suppose that those who submitted to it were slaves.
('8', 178, 1, 13, 430519) The law would have made cowards of us all.
('8', 178, 1, 14, 430562) It would have put an especial affront upon our religion.
('8', 178, 1, 15, 430619) It also sought to stigmatize our children.
('8', 178, 1, 16, 430662) If it had been enforced, we would have been doomed to Locations for ever.
('8', 178, 1, 17, 430736) There is no reference any where in these arguments to finger impressions.
('8', 178, 1, 18, 430810) There are bound to be some who, I know, will despair of this enigma.
('8', 178, 1, 19, 430879) But having lived in enslavement for so many years, we cannot recognize freedom whenwe see it.
('8', 178, 1, 20, 430973) When, after a long period of confinement in a dark room, La Touche [?] 1 was taken out, he was dazzled by sunlight and [asked] to be sent back to his cell.
('8', 178, 1, 21, 431129) In the same way, having remained in a dark room for so long, we cannot bear the light.
('8', 178, 2, 22, 431216) WILL FINGER IMPRESSIONS BE INTRODUCED ELSEWHERE ?
('8', 178, 3, 23, 431266) For my part, I believe that finger impressions will be introduced in many Colonies.
('8', 178, 3, 24, 431350) Nor do I see anything objectionable in this.
('8', 178, 3, 25, 431395) It all depends upon the manner in which they are introduced.
('8', 178, 3, 26, 431456) Shall I refuse to act out of my free choice for fear that the action may be made compulsory in future ?
('8', 178, 3, 27, 431560) Would it be wrong to serve a friend who is ill, fearing that in future he might exact this service from me?
('8', 178, 3, 28, 431668) While in gaol I cleaned latrines of my own accord.
('8', 178, 3, 29, 431719) That did not lead anyone to force me [to do so again].
('8', 178, 3, 30, 431774) If the officials had tried to, they would have got a ready retort.
('8', 178, 3, 31, 431841) I take it to be cowardice to refuse to do something good in itself for fear that it might become compulsory in future.
('8', 178, 3, 32, 431960) This should be enough.
('8', 178, 3, 33, 431983) All these arguments have been advan ced earlier, if not in this form, in some other form.
('8', 178, 3, 34, 432073) They should be studied closely, and we must resolve in our own minds that Hindus

('8', 179, 1, 2, 432210) and Muslims will always stick together.
('8', 179, 1, 3, 432250) They ought not always to be suspicious [of one another].
('8', 179, 1, 4, 432307) We will take every step warily.
('8', 179, 1, 5, 432339) We will not be foolhardy.
('8', 179, 1, 6, 432365) Only if we conduct ourselves in this manner shall we become a single people, and go forward; otherwise we shall he blown apart, like a cloud, by the gentlest breath of wind.

('8', 179, 3, 9, 432639) JOHANNESBURG, March 3, 1908 THE EDITOR, INDIAN OPINION
('8', 179, 4, 10, 432694) SIR, The honour of the Indian community has been vindicated and a great victory won.
('8', 179, 4, 11, 432779) It has earned the admiration of the world and gai ned more prestige.
('8', 179, 4, 12, 432848) During the early stages of the struggle the whitepopulation of the Transvaal and South Africa laughed at the commu nity, and it was only after the movement had gathered momentum that thoseamong the whites who valued truth and were men of conscience came forward to help us.
('8', 179, 4, 13, 433122) In England, the brave Ritch, neglecting his dear, bed ridden wife and his children, rushed about working like a convict under a sentence of hard labour.
('8', 179, 4, 14, 433275) He roused public opinion throughout England.
('8', 179, 4, 15, 433320) His impassioned eloquence touched every heart [and evoked] the sympathy of the nobility, the rich and the poor alike.
('8', 179, 4, 16, 433438) The spark [that he struck] broke forth into a warm burning flame in the hearts of the Transvaal Ministers.
('8', 179, 4, 17, 433545) Indian prisoners were set free as a result and their offer of [voluntary registration] was acce pted.
('8', 179, 4, 18, 433647) Indeed, God has saved the communitys honour.
('8', 179, 4, 19, 433692) The Indians success is the first example of its kind.
('8', 179, 4, 20, 433746) Its value cannot be exaggerated.
('8', 179, 4, 21, 433779) Every Indian ought to be proud of it.
('8', 179, 4, 22, 433817) If one adheres to truth, succour from God or His servants will follow inevitably.
('8', 179, 4, 23, 433899) If we are to keep alive the memory of that divine succour in the minds of our descendants, every Indian will agree that the Federation Hall is a necessity.
('8', 179, 4, 24, 434055) All those who have Indian blood in their veins will work sincerely to promote the cause in every possible manner.
('8', 179, 4, 25, 434169) Since the hall will serve as a memorial, both the poor and the
('8', 179, 5, 26, 434232) 1 Judging from the contents, it appears likely that Gandhiji drafted this.

('8', 180, 1, 2, 434352) rich must help in every way, financial and other.
('8', 180, 1, 3, 434402) It has been decided to build the hall in Johannesburg.
('8', 180, 1, 4, 434457) The collection will start in a few days.
('8', 180, 1, 5, 434498) Every Transvaal Indian must pay 10s at the least and a receipt will be issued to him under the signature of the Chairman of the British Indian Association.
('8', 180, 1, 6, 434654) Businessmen, property owners and other well placed Indians must contribute more than 10s eachthe most they can.
('8', 180, 1, 7, 434766) Any Indian who misleads the people on this issue or indulges in scheming will be an enemy to the country and truth.
('8', 180, 1, 8, 434882) I want to make a special appeal to every Indian to keep clear of the net that such persons may spread for us and, holding God and truth dear, to come forward and help in every way possible.
('8', 180, 1, 9, 435072) It is hoped that the rich will contribute anything between 50 and 100 at the least.
('8', 180, 1, 10, 435156) Those who have registered under the old law are in no way distinct from us.
('8', 180, 1, 11, 435232) Here is an occasion for them to do their duty and make themselves really useful.
('8', 180, 1, 12, 435313) 1 We hope that they will contribute a handsome amount.
('8', 180, 1, 13, 435368) It is especially needful on this occasion to express our appre ciation of Mr. Ritch, the brave man who has worked tirelessly in Eng land as the truest soldier of this campaign at all stages.
('8', 180, 1, 14, 435559) The Asso ciation has resolved to offer him only 300 on behalf of [Indians in] South Africaa paltry amount indeed since, owing to other pressing demands, it will be unable to send a larger sum just now.
('8', 180, 1, 15, 435761) It is essential that this money be raised as quickly as possible.
('8', 180, 1, 16, 435827) Indian leaders all over the South AfricanColonies should collect contributions and send them in time to the British Indian Association at Johannesburg.

('8', 180, 3, 19, 436117) Many friends have asked me to reduce to writing my expe riences of the gaol life, all too brief though it was.
('8', 180, 3, 20, 436228) There were certain things that came under my observation which might be of advantage if they were put in a more or less permanent form.
('8', 180, 3, 21, 436364) Believing as I do

('8', 181, 1, 2, 436598) firmly that incarceration may often be the means of opening the gateway to freedom, liberty, and reform, the experiences I am about to relate may not be profitless to those who do not mind, for the sake of a principle, suffering some inconvenience, or, at any rate, restraint on their personal liberty.
('8', 181, 1, 3, 436901) It was on the 10th of January, 1908, in the afternoon of a Friday, that Messrs P. K. Naidoo, C. M. Pillay, Karwa, Easton and Fortoen (the latter two Chinese) and I were sentenced to be imprisoned for two months, without hard labour, for the crime of not having taken out our registration certificates under the Asiatic Law Amendment Act 1. I was the first to be tried at Johannesburg, and, after receiving my sen tence, and after having been detained for a few minutes at the pris oners yard attached to the Magistrates Court, I was asked to get into a cab, to which I was stealthily taken in order to evade the enormous crowd that was waiting outside the Court House, and was quickly driven to the Fort.
('8', 181, 1, 4, 437606) Many were the thoughts that came surging through my mind as I was being driven.
('8', 181, 1, 5, 437686) Was I to be specially treated as a purely political prisoner?
('8', 181, 1, 6, 437748) Was I to be separated from my fellow pris oners?
('8', 181, 1, 7, 437797) Was I to be taken to the Johannesburg gaol at all?
('8', 181, 1, 8, 437848) To my very great relief I was soon disillusioned.
('8', 181, 1, 9, 437898) I was not to be separated from Mr. Naidoo and others who were tried with me, nor were we to receive any special treatment.
('8', 181, 1, 10, 438021) At the same time I was a little unprepared for what followed.
('8', 181, 1, 11, 438083) We were all first taken to the reception room, as the room which is used for measuring and dressing prisoners is called.
('8', 181, 1, 12, 438204) There we were weighed and totally undressed.
('8', 181, 1, 13, 438249) We were given non labour clothes to wear, consisting of trousers, shirt, jumper, cap, socks, and a pair of closed sandals.
('8', 181, 1, 14, 438372) We were all required to give our digit impressions, and at about four oclock marched to our cell with eight ounces of bread for our evening meal.
('8', 181, 2, 15, 438518) CLASSIFICATION OF ASIATICS WITH NATIVES
('8', 181, 3, 16, 438558) The cell was situated in the Native quarters and we were housed in one that was labelled For Coloured Debtors.
('8', 181, 3, 17, 438669) It was this exper ience for which we were perhaps all unprepared.
('8', 181, 3, 18, 438735) We had fondly imagined that we would have suitable quarters apart from the Natives.
('8', 181, 3, 19, 438819) As it was, perhaps, it was well that we were classed with the Natives.
('8', 181, 3, 20, 438890) We would now be able to study the life of Native prisoners, their customs and manners.
('8', 181, 3, 21, 438977) I felt, too, that passive resistance had not been under taken too soon by the Indian community.
('8', 181, 3, 22, 439073) Degradation underlay the classing of Indians with Natives.
('8', 181, 3, 23, 439132) The Asiatic Act seemed to me to be the summit of our degradation.
('8', 181, 3, 24, 439198) It did appear to me, as I think it would

('8', 182, 1, 2, 439311) appear to any unprejudiced reader, that it would have been simple humanity if we were given special quarters.
('8', 182, 1, 3, 439421) The fault did not lie with the gaol authorities.
('8', 182, 1, 4, 439470) It was the fault of the law that has made no provision for the special treatment of Asiatic prisoners.
('8', 182, 1, 5, 439573) Indeed, the Governor of the gaol tried to make us as comfortable as he could within the regulations.
('8', 182, 1, 6, 439674) The chief warder, as also the head warder, who was in immediate charge of us, completely fell in with the spirit that actuated the Governor.
('8', 182, 1, 7, 439815) But he was powerless to accommodate us bey ond the horrible din and the yells of the Native prisoners throughout the day and partly at night also.
('8', 182, 1, 8, 439962) Many of the Native prisoners are only one degree removed from the animal and often created rows and fought among themselves in their cells.
('8', 182, 1, 9, 440102) The Governor could not separate the very few Indian prisoners (It speaks volumes for Indians that among several hundred there were hardly half a dozen Indian prisoners.) from the cells occupied by the Native prisoners.
('8', 182, 1, 10, 440321) And yet it is quite clear that separation is a physical necessity.
('8', 182, 1, 11, 440388) So much was the classification of Indians and other Asiatics with the Natives insisted upon that our jumpers, which being new were not fully marked, had to be labelled N, meaning Natives.
('8', 182, 1, 12, 440576) How this thoughtless classification has resulted in the Indians being partly starved will be clearer when we come to consider the question of food.
('8', 182, 2, 13, 440724) DESCRIPTION OF THE CELL
('8', 182, 3, 14, 440748) The cell in which we were placed was legally capable of holding thirteen prisoners, so that there was, naturally, sufficient accomm odation to start with.
('8', 182, 3, 15, 440903) It was a novel sensation to be locked up at half past five.
('8', 182, 3, 16, 440963) The cell was a galvanized iron construction, fairly strong, though none too strong for prisoners bent on escaping.
('8', 182, 3, 17, 441078) There was, perhaps, fair ventilation.
('8', 182, 3, 18, 441116) But two small windows at the top, half open, and apertures in the opposite wall hardly reach modern requirements, though I was assured that these cells were the best ventilated of all the prisons in the Transvaal.
('8', 182, 3, 19, 441330) There was electric light in the cell, but the only lamp in it was not strong enough to do any reading with any degree of comfort.
('8', 182, 3, 20, 441460) The light was switched off at eight oclock in the evening and was spasmodically switched on and off during the night.
('8', 182, 3, 21, 441578) A bucket of water and a tin tumbler was our ration of water for the night.
('8', 182, 3, 22, 441653) For natural convenience a bucket in a tray with disinfectant fluid in it was placed in a corner.
('8', 182, 3, 23, 441750) Our bedding consisted of wooden planks fixed to three inch legs, two blankets, an apology for a pillow, and matting.
('8', 182, 3, 24, 441867) At our request the Governor ordered a table and two benches to be placed in the room for writing purposes.
('8', 182, 3, 25, 441974) THE MEALS The cell was opened at six oclock, and with the day began our
('8', 183, 0, 1, 442046) 184 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 183, 1, 2, 442088) first meal.
('8', 183, 1, 3, 442100) For the first week we were served with twelve ounces of mealie pap.
('8', 183, 1, 4, 442168) Most of us had more of the spoon than of the porridge for the first breakfast.
('8', 183, 1, 5, 442247) Neither the Chinese nor the Indians were at all in the habit of taking mealie porridge, especially as it was without any milk or sugar.
('8', 183, 1, 6, 442383) The following is the scale for non labour Native prisoners for the first week: breakfast daily, twelve ounces of mealie porridge; dinner, Monday, Wednesday and Friday, twelve ounces of beans; Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday, one quart of mealie porridge; supper daily, four ounces of crushed mealies and one ounce of fat.
('8', 183, 1, 7, 442712) Indian prisoners, however, get instead of crushed mealies, four ounces of rice and one ounce of ghee (clarified butter).
('8', 183, 1, 8, 442833) This diet was hardly satisfactory not because it was not palatable but because it was not a diet at all suitable for the Asiatic constitution.
('8', 183, 1, 9, 442976) The Chinese fared worse because they had the entire Native scale and therefore no rice.
('8', 183, 1, 10, 443064) For the first few days, for most of us, it meant practically starvation.
('8', 183, 1, 11, 443137) Even when we got over the natural repugnance, it was a diet that constipated some of us and gave diarrhoea to the others; but we weredetermined to go through it and not to ask for any favours or concessions.
('8', 183, 1, 12, 443345) We felt that it was for the Governor to move and see that a more suitable diet was issued to us.
('8', 183, 1, 13, 443442) When, therefore, the Governor enquired whether we had anything to say regarding diet, we simply stated that we did not wish to ask for any concessions, though the diet was not suitable.
('8', 183, 1, 14, 443628) For the second week the scale was a little relieved by the addition of eight ounces of potatoes or vegetables to the dinner when it consisted of mealie porridge, and on Sunday twelve ounces of meat were also added; but, as most of us were either vegetarians or could not take the meat as it was not religiously cut, we had one pound of vegetables.
('8', 183, 1, 15, 443976) This diet, however, did not last long.

('8', 183, 4, 18, 444068) Heavenly means blue and it also means that which is above.
('8', 183, 4, 19, 444127) The book from which we promised last time to publish extracts is called a Blue book, 1 but it has no reference to the [heaven] above.
('8', 183, 4, 20, 444261) We have therefore called it a black book, and it has a hellish look.
('8', 183, 4, 21, 444330) It runs into 88 pages of foolscap size.
('8', 183, 4, 22, 444370) The first letter in it is dated April 4, 1907. We shall omit most of the letters sent by the Indian community from time to time and the letters and represen tations addressed [to the Imperial Government] by the South Africa

('8', 184, 1, 4, 444827) In a cablegram dated July 11, Lord Selborne requested Lord Elgin to issue telegraphic advice of [Royal] assent to the Immigration Bill which the Transvaal Parliament wanted to pass; the cable also contained the substance of the Bill.
('8', 184, 1, 5, 445061) Lord Elgin replied on July 16, saying that it does not appear possible to deal with it by telegraph.
('8', 184, 1, 6, 445162) He had realized from experience that cabling the sanction to such laws led to difficulties [later].
('8', 184, 2, 7, 445262) LORD SELBORNES LETTER
('8', 184, 3, 8, 445284) Replying to Lord Elgin on the question of the Asiatic [Registration] Act, Lord Selborne wrote on July 27: The Colonial Government are not in a position to accept Your Lordships suggestion about the finger impressions.
('8', 184, 3, 9, 445502) Mr. Henrys book has revealed that finger impressions have been in extensive use in India.
('8', 184, 3, 10, 445592) I am surprised to see that Sir Lepel Griffin 1, who has had experience of conditions in India, has taken exception to them.
('8', 184, 3, 11, 445716) For my part, I am convinced that the Asiatics who are lawfully settled in the Transvaal will not object to finger impressions.
('8', 184, 3, 12, 445843) It is certain, however, that those who have been carrying on a traffic in faked permits or have made huge profits by helping illegal immigration will go out of business.
('8', 184, 3, 13, 446013) Similarly, in view of the requirement regarding finger impressions, Indians who have entered unlawfully will find it impossible to stay on [in the Transvaal].
('8', 184, 3, 14, 446172) The magnitude of the traffic, the size of the profits made and the extent of the corruption can be judged from the encloseddocuments.
('8', 184, 3, 15, 446306) Your Lordship may please note that only those cases have been included in the accompanying notes of which the Transvaal Government has had definite information.
('8', 184, 3, 16, 446467) But there must have been many more instances which never came to the notice of the Transvaal Government.
('8', 184, 3, 17, 446572) I wish the officials to keep clear of the kind of temptations which were held out to Superintendent Vernon and Constable Harris by an Indian named Lala.
('8', 184, 3, 18, 446725) The only reason why some Indians have protested against the new Act is that it puts an end to their lucrative business and to the ease with which they have carried it on.

('8', 185, 1, 2, 447264) CHAMNEYS NOTE
('8', 185, 2, 3, 447278) Mr. Chamneys report covers more than seven pages of the Blue book.
('8', 185, 2, 4, 447345) All of this long report is taken up with factual accounts of cases of faked permits, illicit immigration, corruption, substitution of thu mb impressions on permits, furnishing wrong information about age and other fraudulent practices relating to permits.
('8', 185, 2, 5, 447601) About 100 persons are stated to have been arrested for one or the other of these offences between February 1906 and June 24, 1907. About ten of these were Chinamen and the rest Indians.
('8', 185, 2, 6, 447787) The facts in some of these cases are reported by Mr. Chamney as under.
('8', 185, 2, 7, 447858) In May 1907, an Indian named Fateh Mahomed obtained the address of Mr. Cody of the Asiatic Office through a Sikh servant.
('8', 185, 2, 8, 447980) He went to Mr. Codys place and offered a bribe of $50 for permits for two boys from Delagoa Bay.
('8', 185, 2, 9, 448077) In May 1906, a man named Shivabux approached the Asiatic Office with the request that his son, Chandman, be expe lled from the Transvaal.
('8', 185, 2, 10, 448215) It transpired later that Chandman was not his son, but had been brought in fraudulently.
('8', 185, 2, 11, 448304) Chandman wanted later to murder Shivabux; hence the latters request.
('8', 185, 2, 12, 448373) In April 1906, two Indians at Delagoa Bay applied for permits.
('8', 185, 2, 13, 448436) Before the permits were issued, they entered [the Trans vaal] with faked permits.
('8', 185, 2, 14, 448518) It transpired during the trial that they had obtained these permits in Delagoa Bay.
('8', 185, 2, 15, 448602) A notebook found on one of these individuals contained information on questions usually put to the applicants for permits when they are exami ned [by the permit authority]: for example, English, Kaffir and Dutch words in commercial use, a brief description of Johannes burg with particulars of the Indian Location, the Post Office, the Magistrates Court, the railway station, etc.
('8', 185, 2, 16, 448983) The men also stated that 13 others had entered Johannesburg in the samemanner.
('8', 185, 2, 17, 449062) A Chinaman had applied for a permit.
('8', 185, 2, 18, 449099) When he was exam ined, it was found that he had entered the Transvaal under three different names at different times and had been thrice convicted for felony and deported.
('8', 185, 2, 19, 449271) In August, 1906, one Arabi Isa was sentenced to six months hard labour for attempting to bribe [the authorities] in Komatipoort to secure the release of a prisoner.
('8', 185, 2, 20, 449436) In the same month, Dahyabhai Shankarbhai, an Indian, offered to help Sergeant MacDougal earn between 100 and 150 every month if the latter would abet unauthorized immi gration.
('8', 186, 0, 1, 449613) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 187
('8', 186, 1, 2, 449658) A Portuguese detective in the employ of the British Consul at Delagoa Bay wrote in December 1906 that a person named Lala had offered him a bribe of 17 for smuggling two boys into the Transvaal.
('8', 186, 1, 3, 449853) In January 1907, a Chinaman named He yi yang was arrested for erasing the thumb impression on a permit and affi xing another in its place.
('8', 186, 1, 4, 449992) He declared on oath in the Court that he had bought that permit in Delagoa Bay for 40 and that there were 18 other Chinese who had done the same thing.
('8', 186, 1, 5, 450144) In May 1907, one Morar Lala, who had applied for a permit, was arrested.
('8', 186, 1, 6, 450217) At a searching cross examination, he broke into tears and admitted that his name was Zina Lala, and that Morar Lala was his brother who had died after returning to India.
('8', 186, 1, 7, 450388) In March 1907, four Indians entered the Transvaal.
('8', 186, 1, 8, 450439) Their thumb impressions closely resembled those on [their] permits.
('8', 186, 1, 9, 450507) On investigation it was found that the duplicates of four permits had been missing from the [Permit] Office, and that these four persons had erased the thumb impressions and affixed their own instead.
('8', 186, 1, 10, 450708) They are absconding, and the police are still trying to trace them.
('8', 186, 1, 11, 450776) Other cases are on record of persons who were subse quently found to have entered on faked permits but whose whereabouts are still unknown to the police.
('8', 186, 1, 12, 450930) [Two] Indians named Dulabh and Jivan Govind stated in May 1907 that they had bought permits from an Indian and a white respectively for 22 each at Delagoa Bay.
('8', 186, 1, 13, 451090) Some time around June 1907, one Lala Bava stated that he had paid 30 for a permit.
('8', 186, 1, 14, 451173) In Johannesburg, in June 1907, one Kaka Hira said that he had purchased a permit from a person named Kanji Morar for 30. A letter addressed by one Indian to another fell into the hands of the police.
('8', 186, 1, 15, 451373) It said: My respects to you.
('8', 186, 1, 16, 451402) This is to inform you that eight to ten Indians have arrived in Johannes burg.
('8', 186, 1, 17, 451481) If permits can be secured for all of them, I will pay 15 per head.
('8', 186, 1, 18, 451548) This is a fine opportunity for you to earn some money, if you know how to use it. Some time in March 1907, an application for a permit was received from one Shaikh Ahmed.
('8', 186, 1, 19, 451719) [While investigating his claim] Superintendent Vernon discovered that an Indian had offered another 75 for making a false deposition to secure the
('8', 187, 0, 1, 451866) 188 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 187, 1, 2, 451908) entry of three Indians.
('8', 187, 1, 3, 451932) In May 1907, a person named M. Lala was produced in a court of law.
('8', 187, 1, 4, 452000) He had offered 168 to Superintendent Vernon for every person who was allowed to enter the Colony with a faked permit.
('8', 187, 1, 5, 452118) He added that if Superintendent Vernon took up this business, he could make 400 a month and Constable Harris another 200. 1
('8', 187, 2, 6, 452242) LAND RIGHTS
('8', 187, 3, 7, 452254) On August 17, Lord Elgin told the Transvaal Government that, as suggested by Mr. Cox 2, Indians should be given the right to own land at their places of business, to which the Transvaal Government gave a firm reply in the negative.
('8', 187, 4, 8, 452486) DE VILLIERSS NOTE ON IMMIGRATION ACT
('8', 187, 5, 9, 452523) Mr. De Villiers, Attorney General of the Transvaal, comments as follows : 3
('8', 187, 6, 10, 452599) Till now, the restrictions on the entry of persons [into the Transvaal] were enforced by means of the permit system [under the Peace Preservation Ordinance] which was administered thro ugh the office of the High Commissioner.
('8', 187, 6, 11, 452825) After the granting of self rule to the Transvaal, the High Commissioner refused to carry on with the administration of the Ordinance.
('8', 187, 6, 12, 452959) The need was felt therefore of passing an immigration Act on the lines of the Acts of Natal and the Cape Colony.
('8', 187, 6, 13, 453072) The term prohibited immi grants includes those Indians to whom the Asiatic Registration Act is also applicable, that is, even those who possess knowledge of a European language.
('8', 187, 6, 14, 453250) In the same manner, those Asiatics who have temporarily left the Colony in order to evade compliance with that Act are also covered by the term prohibited immi grants.
('8', 187, 6, 15, 453418) That means that only those Asiatics who are in the Colony and who have complied with the provisions of the new Asiatic Act can remain in the Transvaal.
('8', 187, 6, 16, 453570) Besides, section 6 con fers authority [on the Government] to deport those Indians who refuse to obey the law.
('8', 187, 6, 17, 453680) Itis considered necessary to confer such

('8', 188, 1, 2, 454086) authority, for the Asiatic population has openly declared its intention of defying the law.
('8', 188, 1, 3, 454178) It is the Governments intention therefore to deports at any rate, the ringleaders of the agitation, and so avoid the expense and inconvenience incurred in main taining them in the prisons of the Colony.
('8', 188, 1, 4, 454381) The power conferred will be used by the Government with great discretion.
('8', 188, 1, 5, 454455) LORD ELGINS LETTER TO MORLEY Lord Elgin shows little concern for the interests of Indians whom he treats as cowardly, timid and deserving of slavery.
('8', 188, 1, 6, 454605) Forwarding a letter from the South Africa British Indian Committee to Mr. Morley, he writes : 1
('8', 188, 2, 7, 454701) Lord Elgin requests to be favoured with the views of Mr. Morley with regard to section 2(4) and section 6(c).
('8', 188, 2, 8, 454811) The prac tical effect of section 2(4) will be to prevent further immigration into the Transvaal of British Indian or other Asiatics.
('8', 188, 2, 9, 454944) As Mr. Morley is aware, His Majestys Government have practically limited themselves to endeavouring to secure more favourable treatment for those Asiatics who have already acquired a right to reside in the Colony, and have not raised objections to similar legislation in other Colonies.
('8', 188, 2, 10, 455231) He wishes to draw Mr. Morleys attention to Mr. Lytteltons earlier despatch and adds that he does not therefore propose to raise any objection to that section [2(4)].
('8', 188, 2, 11, 455397) 2 Section 6(c) must be considered in connection with the recent Asiatic Law Amendment Act.
('8', 188, 2, 12, 455488) Under that Act, Asiatics failing to register may be ordered to leave the Colony; and failure to comply with such an order is punishable by imprison ment.
('8', 188, 2, 13, 455642) The object of this section is to enable the Government to deport Asiatics who fail to register under the Asiatic Registration Act.
('8', 188, 2, 14, 455773) While the Colonial Secretary feels that the free exercise of so drastic a power is greatly to be deprecated, he doubts whether His Majestys Government can consistently object to a provision the object of which is to enable the Colonial Government to enforce the observance of the Asiatic Registration Act, which His Majestys Government have allowed to become law, and to which the British Indian community appears at present to be
('8', 188, 3, 15, 456204) 1 The translation that follows has been collated with the English original in Indian Opinion, 7 3 1908. 2 Because, the English original goes on to say, in the interests of the British Indians themselves, it is probably desirable, in view of the state of Colonial feeling, that further immigration should be restricted.
('8', 189, 0, 1, 456523) 190 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 189, 1, 2, 456565) disposed to offer an organized resistance.
('8', 189, 1, 3, 456608) He therefore propo ses, subject to any representation which Mr. Morley may wish to make, to accept this provision also.
('8', 189, 1, 4, 456728) Lord Elgin feels thatit will be necessary to press for some amendment of section 6(b) of the Act (which does not especially concern British Indian subjects) and he is accordingly communicating with the Foreign Office.
('8', 189, 2, 5, 456946) WHAT THIS MEANS
('8', 189, 3, 6, 456962) Lord Elgins letter is a very disappointing one.
('8', 189, 3, 7, 457010) His interpre tation of the Act makes it much harsher than the Acts of the Cape Colony or Natal.
('8', 189, 3, 8, 457106) Under the Acts of the Cape Colony and Natal, Ind ians with some knowledge of English are considered eligible, but under the Transvaal Act there is an implied restriction on [the immi gration of] such Indians.
('8', 189, 3, 9, 457315) In spite of this, Lord Elgin asserts that there is nothing new in the Act.
('8', 189, 3, 10, 457390) Besides, section 6(c) relates to deportation of Indians in particular, and this also Lord Elgin appears to approve.
('8', 189, 3, 11, 457506) It follows from this that, if Indians refused to obey a particular law, Lord Elgin would assent to any measure, including the death penalty, to enforce submission to that law.
('8', 189, 3, 12, 457682) Where there is a question of compli cations with foreign governments, Lord Elgin wants amendment of the section concerned, and he has already obtained an assurance from General Smuts about this amendment.
('8', 189, 3, 13, 457887) How can anyone assert, after reading Lord Elgins letter, that the Indian community would not have been utterly ruined if it had not put up a fight, relying on God and its own strength.
('8', 189, 3, 14, 458072) Look at the concern he feels for subjects of foreign governments.
('8', 189, 3, 15, 458138) There is a saying among us, Where there is no fear, there is no love.
('8', 189, 3, 16, 458208) We do not believe that this is true on all occasions, but it is certainly true in Lord Elgins case.
('8', 189, 4, 17, 458308) LORD ELGINS LETTER TO FOREIGN OFFICE
('8', 189, 5, 18, 458345) Lord Elgin requests to be favoured with the views of Sir Edward Grey with regard to section 6(b).
('8', 189, 5, 19, 458443) This sub section emp owers the Colonial Government to remove from the Colony any person whom it deems dangerous to the peace, order and good government of the Colony.
('8', 189, 5, 20, 458610) It appears to confer a danger ously wide power over British subjects as well as over foreign subjects.
('8', 189, 5, 21, 458713) It is true that such power has been conferred in British Bechu analand and elsewhere, where the laws in question were passed under abnormal conditions and at the end of a war.
('8', 189, 5, 22, 458889) No prece dent exists for such legislation in a Colony under responsible government.
('8', 189, 5, 23, 458973) The Privy Council has also objected strongly to such measures.
('8', 189, 5, 24, 459036) Also, the Peace Preservation Ordinance did not confer powers for summary expulsion of anyone.
('8', 189, 5, 25, 459130) Further more,
('8', 190, 0, 1, 459144) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 191
('8', 190, 1, 2, 459189) the late President Krugers Government had passed a law for the expulsion of aliens, which His Majestys Government got repe aled.
('8', 190, 1, 3, 459318) Lord Elgin is therefore disposed to make the non disallo wance of the Act conditional on the amendment of this section.
('8', 190, 1, 4, 459438) What a difference between this letter and the one addressed to Mr. Morley!
('8', 190, 1, 5, 459513) If Lord Elgin had been afraid of the Indian community, he would have advanced much stronger arguments in its favour.
('8', 190, 1, 6, 459630) For example, if it is true that the Imperial Government had protested against President Krugers law of 1896, it protested even more vigorously about the status of the Indian community [under that regime].
('8', 190, 1, 7, 459835) How, then, can the Government now enact laws which it could not do in President Krugers time?
('8', 190, 1, 8, 459929) The reply to this has been given above.
('8', 190, 1, 9, 459969) Since the Indian community is without any influence, why should Lord Elgin care for it?
('8', 190, 2, 10, 460057) MORLEYS REPLY 1
('8', 190, 3, 11, 460073) Mr. Morley regrets that he does not agree with the view that the Act in question is similar to the legislation in other Colonies.
('8', 190, 3, 12, 460203) He does not object to education tests which obtain in other Colonies.
('8', 190, 3, 13, 460273) But section 2(4) introduces a principle to which no parallel can be found in previous legislation.
('8', 190, 3, 14, 460372) This clause perpetuates an arrangement introduced in very special circums tances and will debar from entry into the Transvaal even such Indians as have received education in Europe.
('8', 190, 3, 15, 460554) Furthermore, British Indians who had before 1902 acquired domicile in the Transvaal may also be debarred.
('8', 190, 3, 16, 460660) But they 2 recognize that the Imperial Government must decide the question by considera tions other than the interests of British Indian subjects.
('8', 190, 3, 17, 460807) If the Asiatic Registration Act of 1907 preserves the rights possessed by Indians under the Peace Preservation Ordinance, 1903, they do not desire to offer criticism on the details of the Immigrants Restriction Bill.
('8', 190, 3, 18, 461024) In view of the earlier history of the question, Mr. Morley considers it necessary to accept the sub sections of sections 2 and 6. Since the Asiatic Registration Act has received [Royal] sanction, the Transvaal Government must be granted the additional powers it requires to enforce that Act.
('8', 190, 3, 19, 461316) But the effect of section 4 3 will be to exclude perpetually all British Indian subjects, however high their social status or educational attain ments.
('8', 190, 3, 20, 461468) The Act is therefore harsher than similar laws in other Colonies.
('8', 190, 3, 21, 461534) It is true that under the Act of 1907 temporary
('8', 190, 4, 22, 461582) 1 This is in reply to Lord Elgin's letter above.
('8', 190, 4, 23, 461631) 2 The Government of India, whose views on the question are quoted in the letter for Lord Elgin's information 3 This is an error for 2(4).
('8', 191, 0, 1, 461769) 192 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 191, 1, 2, 461811) permits may be granted.
('8', 191, 1, 3, 461835) Mr. Morley presumes that this power will be used to facilitate the entry of prominentIndians.
('8', 191, 1, 4, 461929) But he thinks it necessary to obtain a definite assurance from the Transvaal Government on this point.
('8', 191, 1, 5, 462032) It is unnecessary to point out to Lord Elgin the unfortunate effect upon public opinion in India which must be produced by the present Bill.
('8', 191, 1, 6, 462173) When the Act of 1907 was sanctioned, Mr. Morley had not imagined that itwould be a permanent measure.
('8', 191, 1, 7, 462275) He therefore trusts that Lord Elgin will write strongly to the Transvaal Government about subsection 4. COMMENT On this Lord Elgin wrote to General Smuts that the Bill would be sanctioned if an assurance was given that permits would be granted to [Indian] chiefs and other [prominent] persons and if the section dealing with the deportation of aliens was suitably amended.
('8', 191, 1, 8, 462648) The Transvaal Government agreed to this, and Lord Elgin put his signature on the Bill.
('8', 191, 1, 9, 462735) The Blue book gives a full account of the case of Ram Sundar.
('8', 191, 1, 10, 462797) As for land rights, the Transvaal Government told Lord Elgin plainly that no such rights would be granted.
('8', 191, 1, 11, 462904) However, we are equally emphatic that the Indian community will enjoy land rights as well in a few years if Indians do not prove to be self seeking and conduct themselves in a manner worthy of their tradition.
('8', 191, 1, 12, 463114) [From Gujarati] Indian Opinion, 7 3 1908
('8', 191, 2, 13, 463155) 94. WHEREIN LIES VICTORY We have been assured that the law will be annulled, and [the principle of] voluntary registration has been accepted.
('8', 191, 2, 14, 463297) That this is a victory, everyone will grant.
('8', 191, 2, 15, 463342) But in this article we want to approach the question from a rather different point of view.
('8', 191, 2, 16, 463434) On reflection we find that in this world what people take to be success is in most cases not real success.
('8', 191, 2, 17, 463541) Sometimes that may signify failure rather than success.
('8', 191, 2, 18, 463597) We do not exaggerate when we say this.
('8', 191, 2, 19, 463636) If someone sets out from home with the intention of committing a robbery, and after much effort gains his end, it may be a success from his point of view.
('8', 191, 2, 20, 463791) On second thoughts we realize that his success was in fact a defeat for him.
('8', 191, 2, 21, 463868) If he had failed, that would have been true success.
('8', 191, 2, 22, 463921) This is an obvious example, for it is easy to understand in this context.
('8', 191, 2, 23, 463995) There are hundreds of occasions in a mans life when he is unable to distinguish easily between right and wrong.
('8', 191, 2, 24, 464107) It is therefore difficult to determine whether the achievement of ones aim is truly failure or triumph.
('8', 191, 2, 25, 464211) It follows from this that success and failure do not essentially depend on the result.
('8', 191, 2, 26, 464298) Besides, the result is not in ones hands.
('8', 191, 2, 27, 464340) Whenever success

('8', 192, 1, 2, 464402) makes a manvain, he behaves like the fly on the wheel which imagines that it is making the wheel go round.
('8', 192, 1, 3, 464509) Mans duty is to do the best he can in a given situation.
('8', 192, 1, 4, 464566) What he achieves then will, in fact, be true success.
('8', 192, 1, 5, 464620) The physicians duty is not to save the patient, for that does not lie in his hands, but to use all his skill in a sincere effort to save him.
('8', 192, 1, 6, 464762) If he does that, he will have succeeded well enough.
('8', 192, 1, 7, 464815) What happens to the patientwhether he lives or dieswill not detract from, or add to, the physicians success.
('8', 192, 1, 8, 464924) We are certain that, if we could have had the law repealed without much effort, that would have satisfied us.
('8', 192, 1, 9, 465034) But then there would have been no question of victory or defeat.
('8', 192, 1, 10, 465099) There would have been no occasion for us to take out a procession [in celebration], neither would the Indians victory be hailed as it is today the world over.
('8', 192, 1, 11, 465258) This would suggest that the Indians victory does not lie so much in the expectations that the law will be annulled as in their exertions to bring about that result.
('8', 192, 1, 12, 465423) Even if the repeal of the law had not come about, the Indians courage would have been admired in every home.
('8', 192, 1, 13, 465532) We can call many similar instances to mind.
('8', 192, 1, 14, 465576) A well known example occurs to me just now.
('8', 192, 1, 15, 465620) A handful of Spartans once stood guarding the pass at Thermopylae and defended it against the enemy to the last man.
('8', 192, 1, 16, 465737) 1 In the end the pass was taken by the enemy.
('8', 192, 1, 17, 465783) But the world knows today that it was the brave Spartans who won.
('8', 192, 1, 18, 465849) Even today, if anyone in Europe shows great courage, it is referred to as Spartan courage.
('8', 192, 1, 19, 465940) As for the Indians, though we cannot claim that they did all they ought to have done, they nevertheless did much.
('8', 192, 1, 20, 466054) They did exert themselves and to that extent we look upon the result, such as it has been, as a triumph.
('8', 192, 1, 21, 466159) The Indian community, it must be noted, will have to go on fighting indefinitely in this spirit.
('8', 192, 1, 22, 466256) For we here want a great many things.
('8', 192, 1, 23, 466294) We want [to own] land; we want to be free to ride in carriages.
('8', 192, 1, 24, 466358) To achieve all this, we shall have to exert ourselves as strenuously as we did on this occasion.
('8', 192, 1, 25, 466455) If we do, it is easy to see that every step forward is in itself a victory.
('8', 192, 1, 26, 466531) For we will be doing our duty at every turn.
('8', 192, 1, 27, 466576) No one will be inflated with success if he looks at it in this light.
('8', 192, 1, 28, 466646) He will never make a mistake and will not even be concerned about the outcome of his labours, for he will not assume the responsibility [for the result].
('8', 192, 1, 29, 466800) The Creator alone must bear that responsibility.
('8', 192, 1, 30, 466849) It is there fore sheer ignorance for one to be impatient to do things like the dog [under a moving cart] who fancied he was drawing the cart.

('8', 193, 1, 2, 467303) 95. GUJARATI EQUIVALENTS FOR PASSIVE RESISTANCE, ETC.
('8', 193, 1, 3, 467357) In response to our offer 1 of a prize for the best Gujarati equivalents for certain English words, we have received some entries, almost all of which, we are sorry to say, are useless.
('8', 193, 1, 4, 467542) Only four persons took the trouble of sending in suggestions, and it would thus appear that our readers take little interest in the language used in Indian Opinion or in Gujarati.
('8', 193, 1, 5, 467722) One of them says that passive resistance can be rendered as pratyupaya.
('8', 193, 1, 6, 467794) He explains the word as connoting [the state of] being passive to whatever happens and taking all possible remedial measures.
('8', 193, 1, 7, 467920) The word and the explanation are both worthless.
('8', 193, 1, 8, 467969) Pratyupaya means counter measure.
('8', 193, 1, 9, 468003) Opposing good to evil will then be pratyupaya, but so will be the use of force to solve a problem.
('8', 193, 1, 10, 468102) Passive resistance means resistance of evil with inner force instead of physical force.
('8', 193, 1, 11, 468190) The explanation offered betrays ignorance.
('8', 193, 1, 12, 468233) A passive resister cannot remain passive to everything that happens.
('8', 193, 1, 13, 468302) In other words, he will always pit his inner strength against everything evil.
('8', 193, 1, 14, 468381) Another equivalent that has been received is kashtadhin prativartan 2. Here the word prati is superfluous and suggestive of antipathy.
('8', 193, 1, 15, 468516) It betrays an ignorance of language.
('8', 193, 1, 16, 468553) Kashtadhin vartan has in it a suggestion of the significance of passive resistance.
('8', 193, 1, 17, 468637) But it is a big word and does not convey the full meaning.
('8', 193, 1, 18, 468696) The third term is dridha pratipaksha 3. Like pratyupaya, this too cannot he used to convey the meaning we attach to passive resistance.
('8', 193, 1, 19, 468832) The person who sent in that word has also sent us an equivalent for civil disobedience.
('8', 193, 1, 20, 468920) It appe ars to have been sent in without much thought.
('8', 193, 1, 21, 468975) The word suggested is satyanadar.
('8', 193, 1, 22, 469009) The meaning here is the contrary.
('8', 193, 1, 23, 469043) It means disobe dience to truth, that is, resistance to truth.
('8', 193, 1, 24, 469106) 4 Civil disobedience is disobe dience to untruth, and it becomes civil if it is truthful in its manner.
('8', 193, 1, 25, 469210) The word [civil] also includes the meaning of passive.
('8', 193, 1, 26, 469265) We have therefore only one word available to us for the present, and that is satyagraha.
('8', 193, 1, 27, 469354) The person 5 who suggested this word would not like his

('8', 193, 2, 29, 469683) Literally, however, it could mean, as Gandhiji assumed, disobedience to truth.
('8', 193, 2, 30, 469762) 5 This was Maganlal Gandhi; he had suggested Satyagraha as an equivalent for passive resistance, which Gandhiji changed into satyagraha.

('8', 194, 1, 3, 470034) Not that he means any slight to theprize, but being in a way connected with this paper, he does not want it awarded to himself.
('8', 194, 1, 4, 470162) We have made these comments with a purpose.
('8', 194, 1, 5, 470206) Those who sent in suggestions for the competition ought to have given careful thought to the meanings of the words they coined.
('8', 194, 1, 6, 470334) It was also necessary for them to understand the meaning of passive resistance.
('8', 194, 1, 7, 470414) To suggest any word that comes into ones head is an insult to ones language; it is to invite ridicule upon oneself.
('8', 194, 1, 8, 470530) Moreover by thus acting [thoughtlessly] in this matter of finding an equivalent for passive resistance, we violate the very principle underlying the movement which we have called satyagraha.
('8', 194, 1, 9, 470721) How can we put up with that?
('8', 194, 1, 10, 470750) We hope that in future these three competitors, and our other readers as well, will take more pains in their ventures and win recognition both for themselves and for the tasks they undertake.

('8', 194, 5, 19, 471355) However, late as it is, they are to be congratulated on having shown wisdom.

('8', 195, 1, 3, 471984) The courage and restraint shown by the Indian community deserved admiration.
('8', 195, 1, 4, 472061) It is rarely, he says, that one comes across anything like this in modern history.
('8', 195, 1, 5, 472144) Sir Lepel Griffin congratulates Mr. Ritch and others who stood by the community on the compromise about registration.
('8', 195, 1, 6, 472262) He refers to thediscussion in the House of Lords and points out that the question of equal rights for Indians is pending.
('8', 195, 1, 7, 472384) In course of time, he believes, the Colonists will realize that the Indian community will not be denied its rights any longer.
('8', 195, 1, 8, 472511) Meanwhile, he advises Indians to go to East Africa, Uganda, Borneo, New Guinea, Jamaica, Burma and other countries, where they would be welcome.
('8', 195, 1, 9, 472656) Dr. Thornton 1, a former judge of the Punjab, says that the wonderful outcome is the result of the Indians firmness and humility in the face of heavy odds; of the powerful but restrained writing in Indian Opinion, of the Indians conducting the campaign in the same spirit [which is in evidence in their writings].

('8', 195, 2, 15, 473589) The commendable courage shown by you and your co workers, the manner in which you have faced hardships and the excellent example that you set by yourself going to gaol are all exceedingly admirable.
('8', 195, 2, 16, 473788) You have proved that you were fighting for truth and convinced the Imperial Government that, whenever the honour of Indians is at stake, they will fight as one man, however weak and helpless they may otherwise be.

('8', 196, 1, 2, 474410) TO INTENDING IMMIGRANTS INTO THE TRANSVAAL
('8', 196, 2, 3, 474453) I have heard that there are some Indians who are trying, as though they were Indias enemies, to enter the Transvaal by unfair means.
('8', 196, 2, 4, 474586) It is thanks mostly to persons such as these that the Indian community has had to submit to all these tribulations over the past 16 months, and it is such men who will injure the interests of the community again.
('8', 196, 2, 5, 474799) I urge every thinking person to take notice of all such attempts at unlawful entry into the Transvaal and reason with the persons concernedand dissuade them from their evil design.
('8', 196, 2, 6, 474980) We must remember that we have bound ourselves with the Government to do all this.
('8', 196, 3, 7, 475062) A PIECE OF NEWS
('8', 196, 4, 8, 475078) I have been informed that those who have already received new registers will get their licences very soon.
('8', 196, 4, 9, 475185) The persons concerned should act immediately in the matter.
('8', 196, 4, 10, 475245) Efforts are being made to see that licences are issued to all traders, whether or not they hold registers.

('8', 196, 6, 13, 475444) 97. MY EXPERIENCE IN GAOL[ I] 1
('8', 196, 7, 14, 475476) Though the imprisonment that the Indian [satyagrahis] and I suffered for a righteous cause was all too brief, I propose to describe my gaol experiences in these columns, having been asked to do so by a number of persons.
('8', 196, 7, 15, 475697) Also, I think it may be useful to others.
('8', 196, 7, 16, 475739) It is also my belief that there are many [other] rights that the Indian community is yet to win by courting imprisonment.
('8', 196, 7, 17, 475861) It is therefore necessary for everyone to have an idea of the hardships of gaol life.
('8', 196, 7, 18, 475947) Often we imagine hardships where in fact there are none.
('8', 196, 7, 19, 476004) Clearly, nothing but good can result from a knowledge of the true state of affairs.
('8', 196, 7, 20, 476088) After two [earlier] attempts by the Government to arrest and imprison me it happened at last at 2 p.m.
('8', 196, 7, 21, 476191) on January 10. Before my colleagues and I received our sentences a telegram was received from Pretoria, which reported that the Indians arrested there for not complying with the Act had received [sentences of] three months hard labour and fines in addition, with a further term of three months

('8', 197, 1, 2, 476612) hard labour in default of payment.
('8', 197, 1, 3, 476647) I was upset by the news, and asked the Magistrate to give me the maximum penalty, but this was not done.
('8', 197, 2, 4, 476752) And so we were all awarded two months simple imprisonment each.
('8', 197, 2, 5, 476816) Messrs P. K. Naidoo, C. M. Pillay, Karwa, Easton and Fortoen were my fellow prisoners.
('8', 197, 2, 6, 476903) The two last named are from China.
('8', 197, 2, 7, 476938) After the sentence I was detained for a few minutes in the Prisoners Yard behind the Court.
('8', 197, 2, 8, 477030) Then I was secretly led to a cab.
('8', 197, 2, 9, 477064) Many were the thoughts that surged in my mind.
('8', 197, 2, 10, 477111) Was I to be given a separate cell and treated as a political prisoner?
('8', 197, 2, 11, 477182) Was I to be isolated from my fellow prisoners?
('8', 197, 2, 12, 477229) Was I to be taken out of Johannesburg?
('8', 197, 2, 13, 477268) These were the thoughts runningthrough my mind.
('8', 197, 2, 14, 477316) I was accompanied by a detective, who was apologetic.
('8', 197, 2, 15, 477370) I told him that he had no reason to be, as he was only doing his duty in taking me to gaol.
('8', 197, 2, 16, 477462) All that I had imagined was soon falsified.
('8', 197, 2, 17, 477506) I was taken to where all prisoners are kept, and was soon joined by my fellow prisoners.
('8', 197, 2, 18, 477595) First, all of us were weighed.
('8', 197, 2, 19, 477626) Then we were asked to give our finger impressions.
('8', 197, 2, 20, 477677) After being stripped we were given prison uniforms to wear, consisting of black trousers, a shirt, a jumper, a cap and socks.
('8', 197, 2, 21, 477803) We were given a bag each to pack away our own clothes in.
('8', 197, 2, 22, 477861) Before being led off to our ward, we were each given eight ounces of bread.
('8', 197, 2, 23, 477937) We were then marched off to a prison intended for Kaffirs.
('8', 197, 3, 24, 477996) INDIANS ON PAR WITH KAFFIRS
('8', 197, 4, 25, 478024) There, our garments were stamped with the letter N, which meant that we were being classed with the Natives.
('8', 197, 4, 26, 478133) We were all prepared for hardships, but not quite for this experience.
('8', 197, 4, 27, 478204) We could understand not being classed with the whites, but to be placed on the same level with the Natives seemed too much to put up with.
('8', 197, 4, 28, 478343) I then felt that Indians had not launched on passive resistance too soon.
('8', 197, 4, 29, 478417) Here was further proof that the obnoxious law was intended to emasculate the Indians.
('8', 197, 4, 30, 478503) It was, however, as well that we were classed with the Natives.
('8', 197, 4, 31, 478567) It was a welcome opportunity to study the treatment meted out to Natives, their conditions [of life in gaol] and their habits.
('8', 197, 4, 32, 478694) Looked at from another point of view, it did not seem right to feel bad about being bracketed with them.
('8', 197, 4, 33, 478799) At the same time, it is indubitably right that Indians should have separate cells.
('8', 197, 4, 34, 478882) The cells for Kaffirs were adjacent to ours.
('8', 197, 4, 35, 478927) They used to make a frightful din in their cells as also in the adjoining yard.
('8', 197, 4, 36, 479007) We were given a separate ward because we were sentenced to simple imprisonment; otherwise we would have

('8', 198, 1, 2, 479195) been in the same ward [with the Kaffirs].
('8', 198, 1, 3, 479237) Indians sentenced to hard labour are in fact kept with the Kaffirs.
('8', 198, 1, 4, 479305) Apart from whether or not this implies degradation, I must say it is rather dangerous.
('8', 198, 1, 5, 479392) Kaffirs are as a rule uncivilisedthe convicts even more so.
('8', 198, 1, 6, 479452) They are troublesome, very dirty and live almost like animals.
('8', 198, 1, 7, 479515) Each ward contains nearly 50 to 60 of them.
('8', 198, 1, 8, 479559) They often started rows and fought among themselves.
('8', 198, 1, 9, 479612) The reader can easily imagine the plight of the poor Indian thrown into such company!
('8', 198, 2, 10, 479698) OTHER INDIAN PRISONERS
('8', 198, 3, 11, 479721) Apart from us, there were hardly three or four Indian prisoners in the whole gaol.
('8', 198, 3, 12, 479804) They were locked up with the Kaffirs and, to that extent, they were worse off than we.
('8', 198, 3, 13, 479891) However, I noticed that they were quite cheerful and enjoyed better health than when they were outside.
('8', 198, 3, 14, 479995) They had earned the favour of the Chief Warder.
('8', 198, 3, 15, 480043) Being quick at their work and well informed, as compared with the Kaffirs, they were given respectable work to do inside the gaol.
('8', 198, 3, 16, 480174) That is, they supervised the work on the machines in the store or did similar jobs which were not strenuous or did not seem unclean.
('8', 198, 3, 17, 480307) They were particularly helpful to us.
('8', 198, 5, 18, 480345) We were kept in a ward 1 which had room for 13 persons.
('8', 198, 5, 19, 480401) It was labelled For Coloured Debtors; that is, for the most part it was used for Coloured persons who were imprisoned for civil offences.
('8', 198, 5, 20, 480539) For ventilation, the ward had two small windows with a strong iron grilling which, I thought, did not let in enough air.
('8', 198, 5, 21, 480660) Galvanized iron sheets served for walls with glazed apertures at three places, half an inch in diameter, through which the gaolers could watch the prisoners whileremaining unobserved themselves.
('8', 198, 5, 22, 480855) The ward next to ours had Kaffir prisoners in it.
('8', 198, 5, 23, 480905) In the wards beyond, there were Kaffirs, Chinese and Cape Boysall witnesseswho had been locked up in gaol lest they should abscond.

('8', 199, 1, 2, 481336) 98. THE LATE DR.
('8', 199, 2, 3, 481353) The late Dr. G. U. Pope 1, whose biography in The Times we reproduce elsewhere, was one of the few Anglo Indians carrying forward today the traditions of fifty years ago.
('8', 199, 2, 4, 481524) His erudition and scholarship need no other outward token than the monument of works with which his name will always be associated.
('8', 199, 2, 5, 481656) There have been few Englishmen for whom the people of Madras should bear greater reverence and deeper respect than Dr. Pope.
('8', 199, 2, 6, 481781) His example is a shining light to the educated classes of Madras leading them along the path of investigation and explanation so that the world may know something of that great past which only recently was sunk in oblivion, that the treasures of literature, philology, philosophy, and theology may be brought to light, and that the people may receive some indication of their line of growth for the future.
('8', 199, 2, 7, 482188) The demise of Dr. Pope is a loss to Indian and European scholarship alike.
('8', 199, 2, 8, 482263) His memory will be ever dear to all who love Indiaand those who have worked for Indias enlightenment in a spirit of sympathy for the people among whom they have spent a lifetime of toil.

('8', 199, 4, 11, 482507) The death of Sir Lepel Henry Griffin removes from the Anglo Indian world a most interesting figure.
('8', 199, 4, 12, 482607) Sir Lepel was a long[ ] and well tried administrator.
('8', 199, 4, 13, 482661) He was a learned man and a good financier.
('8', 199, 4, 14, 482704) He never broke off his relations with India, and as President of the East India Association, he often appeared before the public in connection with Indian affairs.
('8', 199, 4, 15, 482868) Sir Lepel rendered the Indianco mmunity in South Africa great help by heading the deputation that waited on Lord Elgin.
('8', 199, 4, 16, 482988) And Sir Lepel never ceased to take interest in the Indian struggle to the end.
('8', 199, 4, 17, 483067) He allowed himself to be nominated as Vice President of the South Africa British Indian Committee, and, as such, gave the Committee the benefit of his advice and guidance.

('8', 200, 3, 5, 483736) The Estcourt appeal deserves to be noted and pondered over.
('8', 200, 3, 6, 483796) 1 We think the decision of the Court is like rat bite, which does not disturb onein sleep.
('8', 200, 4, 7, 483887) By granting a little respite, however, it is likely to lull the Indians into a false sense of security.
('8', 200, 4, 8, 483991) If that should be the result, the decision of the Court will prove harmful to the interests of the Indian community.
('8', 200, 4, 9, 484108) On the other hand, it is possible that this same decision may turn out to be advantageous to us.
('8', 200, 4, 10, 484205) The community must avail itself of the interregnum to press forward with its efforts to meet the situation.
('8', 200, 4, 11, 484313) The time will then have been put to good use.
('8', 200, 4, 12, 484359) Colonel Greenes powerful address had no effect on the Court, which shows
('8', 200, 5, 13, 484432) 1 On March 2 and 3, 1908, the Estcourt Local Board met to consider appeals from five Indians against the decision of the Licensing Officer refusing the renewal of their licences for 1908. The Licensing Officer's objections to the renewal of A. M. Patel's licence were that (a) his books had been kept in an unsatisfactory manner and that individual entries were incorrect and (b) the books were not of first entry but were written up from verbal information given by the applicant to the book keeper.
('8', 200, 5, 14, 484933) On cross examination of the Licensing Officer by Colonel Greene, it transpired that (a) he had renewed the appellant's licence the previous year although the books had been kept in an identical manner and (b) he had not given any notice to the applicant that they were to be kept any differently in the future.
('8', 200, 5, 15, 485244) The alleged errors in accounting, it was also discovered, were those of G.R. Beattie, a European accountant employed by the appellant.
('8', 200, 5, 16, 485379) Appearing as a witness, Beattie, the Accountant, testified that Hellet, a European shopkeeper, also employed him as book keeper and that he kept books for him in much the same manner.
('8', 200, 5, 17, 485563) By a majority of five to one the Board, however, decided that after a notice period of six months Patel was to liquidate his business.
('8', 200, 5, 18, 485698) Colonel Greene, counsel for appellants then addressed the Board.
('8', 200, 5, 19, 485763) ...the [other] shopkeepers kept note of their transactions in Gujarati and their book keeper .ascertained from them their cash sales and counted up their totals for each day.
('8', 200, 5, 20, 485938) The books were perfectly well kept, indeed remarkably well kept. He added that they were satisfied that the rough books which were kept in Gujarati were not part of the usual books of account kept by a merchant, and they came to this decision after hearing the expert evidence of two well known accountants.
('8', 200, 5, 21, 486246) They were further satisfied that the Gujarati books had been kept at the special instigation of the previous Licensing Officer and that he had been satisfied with their method of keeping these books.
('8', 200, 5, 22, 486446) Under those circumstances he thought the appeals should very properly be allowed.
('8', 200, 5, 23, 486528) Colonel Greene had concluded an earlier address to the Board saying, It had never been intended by the law that any dirty work of this sort should be done by a Local Board of this sort and upon my soul if you refuse this application, I think it will make us all feel like worms. The Local Board ordered the conditional renewal of two of the five licences.

('8', 201, 1, 2, 486926) that the object of the Court is to see the Indians driven out of Estcourt, bag and baggage.
('8', 201, 1, 3, 487018) His address to the Court leads one to expect that he will also help the Indian cause in Parliament.
('8', 201, 1, 4, 487118) Whether or not he does so, the duty of the Indian community is clear.
('8', 201, 1, 5, 487188) It is necessary that this question should be taken up for strong agitation in England.
('8', 201, 1, 6, 487275) A petition should be addressed to the Imperial Government.
('8', 201, 1, 7, 487334) The speeches of Lord Ampthill and Lord Curzon 1 in the House of Lords, which we summarized last week, show that they have grasped the point of the Transvaal campaign.
('8', 201, 1, 8, 487501) It was hinted that the situation resulting from this should be turned to account for finding a solution of the Natal problem; the hint ought to be followed up.
('8', 201, 1, 9, 487661) If in the result we get no redress, we should decide to resort to satyagraha.

('8', 201, 2, 11, 487781) 101. MY EXPERIENCE IN GAOL[ II]
('8', 201, 3, 12, 487813) In front of the cell [s] there was a small yard in which we could move about during the day.
('8', 201, 3, 13, 487906) It was [however] too small for the purpose.
('8', 201, 3, 14, 487950) There is a rule that prisoners in this ward may not go out of the enclosed space without permission, since the bath, urinals and latrines are all located within the yard.
('8', 201, 3, 15, 488121) For bathing there were two large stone basins and two spouts which served for a shower.
('8', 201, 3, 16, 488209) There were buckets for defecation and two more for urine.
('8', 201, 3, 17, 488267) There was no provision for privacy in the bath or latrine.
('8', 201, 3, 18, 488326) Also, the Gaol Regulations forbade the provision of separate latrines which would allow the prisoners privacy.
('8', 201, 3, 19, 488437) It often happened, therefore, that two or three prisoners sat down in a row.
('8', 201, 3, 20, 488514) The arrangements for bathing were similar.
('8', 201, 3, 21, 488557) The buckets for urine, too, stood in the open.
('8', 201, 3, 22, 488604) This may well cause a feeling of revulsion; some would be offended by it.
('8', 201, 3, 23, 488678) But on reflection one realizes that a gaol cannot provide for privacy and that no feeling of shame should attach to the performing of these functions in public.
('8', 201, 3, 24, 488839) It is, therefore, necessary patiently to form the required habits without being squeamish or annoyed at the public nature of these arrangements.
('8', 201, 3, 25, 488984) For sleeping, there were hard wooden planks [mounted on] legs only three inches high.
('8', 201, 3, 26, 489070) Each prisoner had two rugs, a small pillow and a coir mat large enough to roll them up in.
('8', 201, 3, 27, 489161) Sometimes three rugs were

('8', 202, 0, 1, 489475) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 203
('8', 202, 1, 2, 489520) allowed to a prisoner but only as a favour.
('8', 202, 1, 3, 489564) Some were put out at the thought of [sleeping on] a hard bench.
('8', 202, 1, 4, 489628) Those used to soft mattresses cannot easily take to hard bedding.
('8', 202, 1, 5, 489694) According to medical science, hard bedding is to be preferred.
('8', 202, 1, 6, 489757) If we, therefore, adopt the practice of using hard bedding at home, we will not find it difficult to get used to the kind of bedding available in gaol.
('8', 202, 1, 7, 489909) A bucket of water was provided in the cell, and another bucket placed on a large tray served for a chamber pot, for no prisoner was allowed to leave the cell at night.
('8', 202, 1, 8, 490077) Everyone was provided, according to his needs, with a little soap, a homespun towel and a wooden spoon.
('8', 202, 2, 9, 490181) SANITATION
('8', 202, 3, 10, 490192) I must say that sanitation in the gaol was excellent.
('8', 202, 3, 11, 490246) Every day, the floor of the cell was washed with a disinfectant and the edges of the floor [skirting the wall] lime washed.
('8', 202, 3, 12, 490370) The cell therefore always looked fresh.
('8', 202, 3, 13, 490410) The bathroom and the commodes were also washed with soap and disinfectant.
('8', 202, 3, 14, 490485) I believe, I am myself very particular about sanitation.
('8', 202, 3, 15, 490542) Therefore, when, towards the end, a large number of our people joined us, I myself used to wash the commodes with disinfe ctant fluid.
('8', 202, 3, 16, 490677) To remove the stool, a few Chinese prisoners turned up every morning at nine oclock.
('8', 202, 3, 17, 490762) Afterwards, whenever it was necessary to clean up or wash, we had to do it ourselves.
('8', 202, 3, 18, 490848) The planks of the beds were washed every day with sand and water.
('8', 202, 3, 19, 490914) The only inconvenience was that, as it happened, the pillows and rugs changed hands among the hundreds of prisoners.
('8', 202, 3, 20, 491031) Though there was a rule that required the rugs to be aired in the sun every day, it was hardly ever observed.
('8', 202, 4, 21, 491141) SOME RULES
('8', 202, 5, 22, 491152) There are some gaol rules which everyone should know.
('8', 202, 5, 23, 491206) The prisoners are locked up at half past five in the afternoon.
('8', 202, 5, 24, 491270) They read or converse in the cell up to eight in the evening.
('8', 202, 5, 25, 491332) At eight, everyone must go to bed, meaning that even if one cannot sleep, one must get into bed.
('8', 202, 5, 26, 491429) Talking among prisoners after eight constitutes a breach of Gaol Regulations.
('8', 202, 5, 27, 491507) The Kaffir prisoners do not observe this rule too strictly.
('8', 202, 5, 28, 491567) The warders on night duty, therefore, try to silence them by knocking against the walls with their truncheons and shouting, Thula!
('8', 202, 5, 29, 491698) thula! Prisoners are strictly forbidden to smokea rule which is enforced scrupulously.
('8', 202, 5, 30, 491785) But I saw that the confirmed smokers among the prisoners broke the rule on the sly.
('8', 202, 5, 31, 491869) A bell is rung at half past five in the morning to wake up the prisoners.
('8', 202, 5, 32, 491943) Everyone must then get up, roll up his bedding and wash.
('8', 202, 5, 33, 492000) The door of the cell is opened at six when each prisoner must stand up with his arms crossed and his bedding rolled up beside him.
('8', 202, 5, 34, 492131) A sentry then calls the roll.
('8', 203, 0, 1, 492161) 204 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 203, 1, 2, 492203) a similar rule, every prisoner is required to stand beside his bed, while he is being locked up [at night].
('8', 203, 1, 3, 492311) The prisoners may not have anything else in their possession except what is given them by the gaol autho rities.
('8', 203, 1, 4, 492424) Except clothes, they are forbidden to keep anything without the Governors permission.
('8', 203, 1, 5, 492510) One of the buttons on every prisoners shirt has sewn on to it a small pocket which contains a card bearing his number, his name, the particulars of his sentence, etc.
('8', 203, 1, 6, 492677) Normally the prisoners may not stay in the cell during the day.
('8', 203, 1, 7, 492741) Those sentenced to hard labour cannot do so in any case, since they are engaged in their work, but even the others are not allowed to stay in.
('8', 203, 1, 8, 492884) They must remain in the yard outside the cell.
('8', 203, 1, 9, 492931) The Governor had allowed us a table and two benches in the ward, and these were very useful.
('8', 203, 1, 10, 493024) There is a rule that every prisoner sentenced to two months [or more] must have his hair cropped close and the moustache shaved off.
('8', 203, 1, 11, 493157) In the case of Indians the rule is not enforced rigorously.
('8', 203, 1, 12, 493217) Should a prisoner object, his moustache is spared.
('8', 203, 1, 13, 493268) In this connection I had an amusing experience.
('8', 203, 1, 14, 493316) I knew very well that prisoners had to have their hair cropped.
('8', 203, 1, 15, 493380) I also knew that the rule about having the prisoners hair and moustache removed was really for his own convenience and not to humiliate him.
('8', 203, 1, 16, 493521) Personally, I believe that it is a very useful rule.
('8', 203, 1, 17, 493574) In gaol thereare no combs or other means for keeping the hair tidy.
('8', 203, 1, 18, 493642) If the hair is not groomed, there is the risk of scabies.
('8', 203, 1, 19, 493700) On hot days, hair makes one feel extremely uncomfortable.
('8', 203, 1, 20, 493758) Moreover, the prisoners are not given a looking glass.
('8', 203, 1, 21, 493813) There is the danger, therefore, of the moustache remaining unclean.
('8', 203, 1, 22, 493881) As there is no serviette for use at meals and the wooden spoon is rather awkward to handle, food is apt to stick in the moustache.
('8', 203, 1, 23, 494012) It was my intention to go through all the experi ences of a prisoner.
('8', 203, 1, 24, 494082) I therefore asked the Chief Warder to have my hair cropped and my moustache shaved off.
('8', 203, 1, 25, 494170) He told me the Governor had strictly forbidden that.
('8', 203, 1, 26, 494223) I said, I knew that he did not wish to force me [to observe this rule], but that I myself wanted it.
('8', 203, 1, 27, 494324) He suggested that I might apply to the Governor.
('8', 203, 1, 28, 494373) The next day, permission was received from him.
('8', 203, 1, 29, 494421) But he said that, since two days out of my two month period had elapsed, he had now no right to order the cropping of my hair and moustache.
('8', 203, 1, 30, 494562) I said, I knew the rule but wanted this of my own free will and for my own convenience.
('8', 203, 1, 31, 494650) He smilingly demurred.
('8', 203, 1, 32, 494673) I learnt later that the Governor had felt a little apprehensive.
('8', 203, 1, 33, 494738) So I offered to state in writing that I had myself requested the cropping [of my hair].
('8', 203, 1, 34, 494826) This allayed the Governors suspicion, and he ordered the Chief Warder to give me clippers and a pair of scissors.
('8', 203, 1, 35, 494940) My fellow prisoner, Mr. P. K. Naidoo, was a master of the tonsorial art.
('8', 203, 1, 36, 495013) I, too, know something of it.
('8', 203, 1, 37, 495043) When the others saw me cropping my hair and moustache, they saw the point of it, and followed suit.
('8', 203, 1, 38, 495143) Some of them
('8', 204, 0, 1, 495156) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 205
('8', 204, 1, 2, 495201) had only their hair cropped.
('8', 204, 1, 3, 495230) Mr. Naidoo and I, between us, spent two hours each day clipping the Indians hair.
('8', 204, 1, 4, 495312) I believe, this made for better health and convenience.
('8', 204, 1, 5, 495368) The prisoners looked the smarter for it.
('8', 204, 1, 6, 495409) The use of the razor is strictly forbidden in gaol.
('8', 204, 1, 7, 495461) Only clippers and scissors are allowed.
('8', 204, 2, 8, 495501) INSPECTION
('8', 204, 3, 9, 495512) When the officials come to inspect the prisoners, the latter have all to line up.
('8', 204, 3, 10, 495594) As the official approaches, they must take off their caps and salute him.
('8', 204, 3, 11, 495668) All the prisoners wore caps, and it was not difficult to take them off, for there was a rule that they must be taken off, and this was only proper.
('8', 204, 3, 12, 495816) The order to line up was given by shouting the command fall in whenever an official came.
('8', 204, 3, 13, 495906) The words fall in therefore became our daily diet.
('8', 204, 3, 14, 495957) They meant that the prisoners should fall in line and stand to attention.
('8', 204, 3, 15, 496031) This happened four or five times a day.
('8', 204, 3, 16, 496071) One of these officials, who bore the designation of Assistant Chief Warder, was somewhat strict.
('8', 204, 3, 17, 496168) The Indian prisoners therefore nicknamed him General Smuts.
('8', 204, 3, 18, 496228) He often came early in the morning, and sometimes in the afternoon as well.
('8', 204, 3, 19, 496304) The doctor came at half past nine.
('8', 204, 3, 20, 496339) He appeared to be a kind and well meaning person.
('8', 204, 3, 21, 496389) He made solicitous inquiries about our health.
('8', 204, 3, 22, 496436) Under the Gaol Regula tions, every prisoner must undress himself in public for examination by the doctor.
('8', 204, 3, 23, 496542) But the doctor did not insist on the observance of this rule.
('8', 204, 3, 24, 496604) Moreover, when the number of Indian prisoners increased, he asked them if anyone had eczema or similar infection, so that he might examine the person in private.
('8', 204, 3, 25, 496766) The Governor and the Chief Warder used to come at half past ten or eleven.
('8', 204, 3, 26, 496841) The Governor appe ared to be firm, fair minded and quiet tempered.
('8', 204, 3, 27, 496908) He always had the same questions to ask: Are you all well?
('8', 204, 3, 28, 496967) Is there anything you want?
('8', 204, 3, 29, 496995) Have you any complaints? He listened to a request or a complaint patiently and granted every request which was reasonable; if there was a [genuine] grievance, he set matters right.
('8', 204, 3, 30, 497176) I shall discuss some of the complaints and demands later.
('8', 204, 3, 31, 497234) The Deputy Governor also came sometimes.
('8', 204, 3, 32, 497275) He, too, was a kindly person.
('8', 204, 3, 33, 497305) But the kindest among them all, the most gentle and sympathetic, was the official known as the Chief Warder, who was especially charged with looking after us.
('8', 204, 3, 34, 497464) He is a very devout man; we were not the only ones to whom he was nice and courteous in every way; [for] the other prisoners were also very warm in their praises of him.
('8', 204, 3, 35, 497634) He was anxious to respect prisoners rights.
('8', 204, 3, 36, 497678) He would condone any minor offence on their part.
('8', 204, 3, 37, 497728) He was particularly kind to us because he thought that we had not really committed any offence.
('8', 204, 3, 38, 497824) Often he talked with us and even expressed sympathy.

('8', 205, 1, 2, 497919) PRISONERS INCREASE
('8', 205, 2, 3, 497938) I mentioned earlier that we were five satyagrahi prisoners to begin with.
('8', 205, 2, 4, 498012) On Tuesday, January 14, we were joined by Mr. Thambi Naidoo, the Chief Picket, and Mr. Quinn, Chairman of the Chinese Association.
('8', 205, 2, 5, 498143) All of us were happy to see them.
('8', 205, 2, 6, 498177) On January 16, 14 others came, Samunder Khan being one of them.
('8', 205, 2, 7, 498241) He had been sentenced to a two month term.
('8', 205, 2, 8, 498284) The remaining 13 included Madrasis, Kanamias and Gujarati Hindus.
('8', 205, 2, 9, 498350) All of them had been arrested for hawking without licences and fined 2 each with 14 days imprison ment in default of payment.
('8', 205, 2, 10, 498476) They had had courage enough to refuse payment of the fine and to prefer imprisonment.
('8', 205, 2, 11, 498562) On Tuesday, January 21, another 76 persons joined us.
('8', 205, 2, 12, 498616) Among them, only Nawab Khan had been sentenced to two months, the rest having been fined 2 each with 14 days imprisonment in default of payment.
('8', 205, 2, 13, 498761) Most of them were Gujarati Hindus, the rest Kanamias and Madrasis.
('8', 205, 2, 14, 498828) On Wednesday, January 22, there was a further addition of 35 persons.
('8', 205, 2, 15, 498898) On the 23rd, three more arrived, one on the 24th, two on the 25th, six on the 28th, and, on the evening of the same day, four more.
('8', 205, 2, 16, 499030) On the 29th, there were again four arrivals, all of them Kanamias.
('8', 205, 2, 17, 499097) That made a total of 155 up to January 29. On Thursday, that is, on the 30th, I was taken to Pretoria.
('8', 205, 2, 18, 499200) But I remember, on that day also, five or six more prisoners arrived.

('8', 205, 4, 21, 499337) Registration is in progress.
('8', 205, 4, 22, 499366) There are, however, some persons who appear to be bent on working against the communitys interests; they recognize only self interest.
('8', 205, 4, 23, 499501) They furnish false information in their applications.
('8', 205, 4, 24, 499555) All this will do us harm.
('8', 205, 4, 25, 499581) There are others who imagine that, as a result of the movement, it should be possible to save even those who have no right to be here.
('8', 205, 4, 26, 499716) It is difficult to understand how a movement conducted in defence of right can also serve wrong.
('8', 205, 4, 27, 499813) If the sun shines by virtue of the truth of the truthful, it warms the untruthful as well; so it may also be possible legitimately to safeguard the interests of a few persons living here unlawfully, provided a majority of the Indians are truthful.
('8', 205, 4, 28, 500061) We may then be able to request the Government not to harass those who are here without permits.
('8', 205, 4, 29, 500157) They have, however, undeniably committed an offence in law.
('8', 205, 4, 30, 500217) But theirs is not an offence calling for rigorous punishment.
('8', 205, 4, 31, 500279) If these persons argue their case properly and tell the Government how they

('8', 206, 1, 2, 500400) came in, I believe it will overlook [their offence] and order regis tration certificates to be issued to them.
('8', 206, 1, 3, 500511) But before this can be done, the Indian community must get over its eagerness to have all that it wants.
('8', 206, 1, 4, 500616) It is essential to furnish correct information in the applications, and one must think twice about bringing new persons in [unlawfully].
('8', 206, 1, 5, 500753) One should bear in mind that greed always begets sin.
('8', 206, 2, 6, 500807) DINNER TO FRIENDS OF INDIANS
('8', 206, 3, 7, 500836) Mr. Cartwright, [Rev.] Mr. Phillips, Mr. Doke and other eminent Englishmen who have helped us a great deal have been invited to a dinner on Saturday; some Indians will also be present.
('8', 206, 3, 8, 501021) We can claim that this is perhaps the first occasion of its kind in South Africa.

('8', 208, 1, 2, 502858) 105. MY GAOL EXPERIENCES [ II]
('8', 208, 2, 3, 502889) CHANGE IN THE DIET
('8', 208, 3, 4, 502908) On the 14th of January came Messrs Thambi Naidoo and Quinn.
('8', 208, 3, 5, 502968) That, however, did not affect the situation much, as they were quite willing to rough it, but on the 18th, fourteen more came.
('8', 208, 3, 6, 503095) With the exception of one, these were hawkers who were sentenced to pay two pounds fine or to suffer fourteen days imprisonment.
('8', 208, 3, 7, 503224) It was not possible to expect these men to accommodate themselves all of a sudden to a diet to which they were never used.
('8', 208, 3, 8, 503347) Consequently it was a matter of grave anxiety.
('8', 208, 3, 9, 503394) It was duly brought to the notice of the Governor who professed helplessness by regulation.
('8', 208, 3, 10, 503486) He was quite willing to respect any religious objections but where it was a matter merely of likes and dislikes, he could not help.
('8', 208, 3, 11, 503618) Prison life was prison life and peoples tastes could not be respected.
('8', 208, 3, 12, 503689) All this would be true, if it were merely a matter of tastes.
('8', 208, 3, 13, 503751) Unfortunately it was a matter of habit.
('8', 208, 3, 14, 503791) And the scale having been fixed without due regard for national habits of Asiatics, the system broke down under the stress.
('8', 208, 3, 15, 503915) just as it would be foolish for Indians to expect national food adjuncts, such as curries, etc., it was foolish for the authorities to have prescribed a diet however nutritious it might be medically that was unsuitable for Indians.
('8', 208, 3, 16, 504147) Boiled beef or mutton would be just as useless for Indians as mealie pap.
('8', 208, 3, 17, 504221) They could live on wheaten and rice preparations, no matter how simple they might be.
('8', 208, 3, 18, 504307) But they could not live on what might be African delicacies.
('8', 208, 3, 19, 504368) So that the new batch of prisoners faced starvation.
('8', 208, 3, 20, 504421) They went without breakfast.
('8', 208, 3, 21, 504450) And rice they received for dinner, i.e., four ounces with one ounce of ghee insufficient as it was even with the breakfast was much more so for people who broke their fast on the above quantity of rice.
('8', 208, 4, 22, 504653) A PETITION IN PRISON
('8', 208, 5, 23, 504674) The following petition 1 was, therefore, forwarded through the Governor to the Director of Prisons.
('8', 208, 5, 24, 504774) Owing to the arrival, as stated at the foot of the petition, of about seventy more passive resisters, I requested the Governor either to tele graph or to telephone its contents and to apply for prompt instruc tions.
('8', 208, 5, 25, 504990) This he kindly did and orders were given immediately, pendingfurther consideration, to replace mealie pap for breakfast by four ounces of bread and to do the same thing for supper by issuing

('8', 209, 0, 1, 505244) 210 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 209, 1, 2, 505286) eight ounces ofbread.
('8', 209, 1, 3, 505308) Whilst the matter was being further considered, the compromise supervened and we were all discharged.
('8', 209, 2, 4, 505410) A CONTRAST
('8', 209, 3, 5, 505421) Yet it must be clear to the reader that this question of food for Asiatic Prisoners is too important to be given up.
('8', 209, 3, 6, 505538) It is only because there are ordinarily very few Indian presoners in the Transvaal gaols that the matter has not attracted attention before now.
('8', 209, 3, 7, 505683) The change ordered by the Director removed the most four ounces of bread even for non labour Prisoners is a mere morsel.
('8', 209, 3, 8, 505804) And although the medical officer stated that the addition of cocoa or butter or dholl would be considered a relish and therefore not allowed as a prison diet, I venture to think that some such addition is absolutely necessary to make bread eatable.
('8', 209, 3, 9, 506053) Now let us for a moment glance at the scale for non labour European Prisoners.
('8', 209, 3, 10, 506132) They get for breakfast one pint of porridge and four ounces of bread; for dinner eight ounces of bread daily, together with meat or soup or beans, potatoes or vegetables; for supper they get eight ounces of bread and one pint of porridge.
('8', 209, 3, 11, 506371) I understand that they also get cocoa or some such drink.
('8', 209, 3, 12, 506429) Now it does not seem clear why the Europeans should get porridge and four ounces of bread whereas Indians should get four ounces of bread in place of porridge.
('8', 209, 3, 13, 506589) Have the former a greater appetite than Indians?
('8', 209, 3, 14, 506638) Then again, why should Indians get only twelve ounces of beans when Europeans get the same quantity of beans and eight ounces of bread?
('8', 209, 3, 15, 506774) This is an anomaly which is most difficult to understand.
('8', 209, 3, 16, 506832) It may be possible to reconcile oneself to the Europeans getting a greater variety of superior or more expensive food; but it is not possible to do so with regard to the quantity of foods.
('8', 209, 3, 17, 507021) It is obvious, therefore that the Indian dietary needs a great deal of modification.
('8', 209, 3, 18, 507106) Then again, the fact that the Colonial Secretary never troubled himself about the food provided for men who could not be classed as ordinary Prisoners betray in my opinion callous contempt for the Indian community.
('8', 209, 3, 19, 507321) In vie of the compromise effected, one does not wish to say much on this Painful phase of the question.

('8', 209, 5, 22, 507494) Mr. Ritch continues to write his weekly letters, though we do not think there is need to publish them at present.
('8', 209, 5, 23, 507608) Most of his news, sincewe already know of it from cables, appears old.
('8', 209, 5, 24, 507679) In his last letter, however, he has inquired if the Committee is to be continued.
('8', 209, 5, 25, 507761) We reproduce below a portion of the letter:
('8', 210, 0, 1, 507805) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 211
('8', 210, 1, 2, 507850) At the meeting on Tuesday, the Committee discussed the question of its future.
('8', 210, 1, 3, 507929) Lord Ampthill was present.
('8', 210, 1, 4, 507956) Others who attended were Sir Muncherjee, Mr. T.J. Bennett 1, Sir William Wedderburn 2, Dr. Thornton and Mr. [J. H.] Polak 3. Lord Ampthill told the Committee that its work had only just begun.
('8', 210, 1, 5, 508149) Others were also of the view that it would be wrong to wind up the Committee.
('8', 210, 1, 6, 508227) You must have noticed how Lord Ampthill still persists in his efforts.
('8', 210, 1, 7, 508298) Some of the members are so enthusiastic about the Committees work that they want the work continued at any cost.
('8', 210, 1, 8, 508411) I have been asked by the Committee to ascertain your views in the matter.
('8', 210, 1, 9, 508485) I need not tell the Association anything about the members and the work they have been doing.
('8', 210, 1, 10, 508579) Everyone will admit that, once the Committee ceases to function, it will be difficult to revive it.
('8', 210, 1, 11, 508679) Again, I need not say anything about the problems of the Transvaal and Natal which still await solution.
('8', 210, 1, 12, 508784) There was a communication from the Natal [Indian] Congress about the harassment of Indians under the [Dealers] Licenses Act.
('8', 210, 1, 13, 508909) This is a question of great importance.
('8', 210, 1, 14, 508949) If it is to be taken up for agitation, the Indian community there, it is hoped, will not mind the spending of some money.
('8', 210, 1, 15, 509071) In view of Mrs. Ritchs illness, it is necessary for me to stay on here for at least a few months.
('8', 210, 1, 16, 509169) She has had to be opera ted upon a second time.
('8', 210, 1, 17, 509217) She has been reduced to a state in which she has to have two nurses to attend on her.
('8', 210, 1, 18, 509303) In the circu mstances, I am unable to leave this place.
('8', 210, 1, 19, 509359) If I can start my own practice here, the Committee will have less to spend on my account.
('8', 210, 1, 20, 509449) If, in addition, I can have an office for myself, that will save the Committee rent.
('8', 210, 1, 21, 509534) These are the lines along which I have been thinking.
('8', 210, 1, 22, 509588) Mr. Jinnah, Bar at Law, showed me a telegram from Mr. Mahomed Shah of President Street, which says that about 700 Muslims are displeased with the compromise and that they are determined not to apply for registration.
('8', 210, 1, 23, 509805) I have suggested a Mr. Jinnah to say in reply that he was happy to learn from the cables that all the people tin the Transvaal] were

('8', 211, 1, 3, 510449) Kindly let me know the correct position.
('8', 211, 1, 4, 510490) It is for the Indian community to decide what it wants to do about the Committee.
('8', 211, 1, 5, 510572) The need to continue the Committee is obvi ous.
('8', 211, 1, 6, 510620) Had it not been for Mrs. Ritchs illness, the Committees expen ses would have been much less.
('8', 211, 1, 7, 510713) It is, however, a matter for some satis faction that the Committee was able to function as economically as it has done.
('8', 211, 1, 8, 510833) We believe therefore that all [branch] Associations and indi vidual Indians will try and ensure that the Committee is enabled to continue its work.
('8', 211, 1, 9, 510981) This will be easy if a large number of persons int erest themselves in the question.
('8', 211, 1, 10, 511066) We hope that every Indian will help in every possible way and all the Associations will express their views.

('8', 211, 3, 13, 511242) INDIANS DINNER TO EUROPEANS
('8', 211, 4, 14, 511270) The Indian community fulfilled one of its many obligations on Saturday last, the 14th.
('8', 211, 4, 15, 511357) Some Europeans have helped us a great deal in the satyagraha movement.
('8', 211, 4, 16, 511428) It was but proper that the community should do something to show its regard for them.
('8', 211, 4, 17, 511514) It was eventually decided to arrange a banquet and to issue tickets for the purpose.
('8', 211, 4, 18, 511599) The tickets were to be priced and the proceeds spent on meeting the expenses of the banquet.
('8', 211, 4, 19, 511692) This would show whether or not the Indian leaders were willing to loosen their purse strings.
('8', 211, 4, 20, 511786) The Association would not have to bear the expense, and we would be enabled to come into closer contact with the whites.
('8', 211, 4, 21, 511907) The suggestion was approved by all.
('8', 211, 4, 22, 511943) A date was fixed for the banquet.
('8', 211, 4, 23, 511977) The Masonic Hall was secured through the good offices of Mr. Kallenbach 1, and the Secretary of the Hall volunteered to make the necessary arrangements for the banquet.
('8', 211, 4, 24, 512146) The tickets were priced at two guineas each.
('8', 211, 4, 25, 512191) The management of the Masonic Hall charged us ten shillings per head, and some money was

('8', 212, 1, 6, 513542) They did not attend, but most of them sent their good wishes for the occa sion.
('8', 212, 1, 7, 513622) Mr. Stent sent a telegram.
('8', 212, 1, 8, 513649) Mr. Pim, in a letter, expressed regret at not being able to attend owing to other engagements.
('8', 212, 1, 9, 513744) It was his sincere hope, he added, that our problem would be satisfactorily solved and that the goodwill that existed between the Government and the Indian community would endure.
('8', 212, 1, 10, 513924) The President of the Chinese Association, Mr. Quinn, was present.
('8', 212, 1, 11, 513990) There were about 40 Indians at the function.
('8', 212, 1, 12, 514035) Mr. Essop Mia presided.
('8', 212, 1, 13, 514059) Mr. Mia, Mr. Imam Abdool Kadir, Mr. Cama and Mr. Gandhi thanked the whites who had been of help.
('8', 212, 1, 14, 514156) They were followed by Mr. Hosken, who replied on behalf of the whites.
('8', 212, 1, 15, 514227) In the course of his speech he said: 6
('8', 212, 2, 16, 514266) I feel ashamed now to think that in July [1907] I had advised the Indian community to accept the law.
('8', 212, 2, 17, 514368) I meant well.
('8', 212, 2, 18, 514382) I felt it would prove to be futile to resist the Boer Government.
('8', 212, 2, 19, 514448) But Mr. Gandhi told me that they did not depend on human help for their movement.
('8', 212, 2, 20, 514530) They depended on divine aid.
('8', 212, 2, 21, 514559) They were sure of help from Him in Whose name they had embarked on the movement.
('8', 212, 2, 22, 514640) I see his words have come true.
('8', 212, 2, 23, 514672) The courage shown by the Indian community has won for it increased sympathy from the whites.
('8', 212, 2, 24, 514765) The Indian community has taught the whites a great deal.
('8', 212, 2, 25, 514822) I was glad to receive your invitation.
('8', 212, 2, 26, 514861) Whites and Coloured persons ought to live together amicably.
('8', 212, 2, 27, 514922) The Indian community deserves praise for the unity, patience and humility it has shown.

('8', 213, 0, 1, 515476) 214 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 213, 1, 2, 515518) Mr. Cartwright said that he was sorry he had not been able to do more.
('8', 213, 1, 3, 515589) The Indian community, he thought, had gained immenselyin respect through its courage.
('8', 213, 1, 4, 515675) The example it had set was well worth following.
('8', 213, 1, 5, 515724) Mr. Phillips said: I associate myself with what Mr. Hosken has said.
('8', 213, 1, 6, 515793) The Asiatics have shown true faith in God.
('8', 213, 1, 7, 515836) The Chinese have set a worthy example by donating 105 to an association in aid of the poor among the whites.
('8', 213, 1, 8, 515945) It is no small matter for the Chinese to have helped the same Association that refuses help to any Coloured person and the very whites who have harassed them so much.
('8', 213, 1, 9, 516112) I am indeed glad that we have assembled here today in this manner.
('8', 213, 1, 10, 516179) There are some persons who are afraid that the Government may play foul, but it will be unable to do so now.
('8', 213, 1, 11, 516288) If it does, a large number of whites will come forward to oppose it.
('8', 213, 1, 12, 516357) Mr. Doke said in his speech that satyagraha was a true battle that the Indians had fought.
('8', 213, 1, 13, 516448) He hoped that they would preserve the good name that they had earned.
('8', 213, 1, 14, 516518) Mr. Proctor said: Reuters duty is no more than to disseminate news.
('8', 213, 1, 15, 516586) If Mr. Polak had not supplied the required information, Reuter would not have been able to do what it did.
('8', 213, 1, 16, 516693) He was followed by Mr. D. Pollock who said: The Indian community has opened the gates of freedom to the entire Coloured population.
('8', 213, 1, 17, 516825) It has taught what true Imperialism means.
('8', 213, 1, 18, 516868) It has, by its work, brought the blacks and the whites closer together.
('8', 213, 1, 19, 516940) There was then a brief speech by Mr. Polak, which was followed by God Save the King.
('8', 213, 1, 20, 517025) The meeting then dispersed at 11 p.m.
('8', 213, 1, 21, 517063) The menu card had the following printed on it: This dinner is arranged as an expression of gratitude to those whites who fought for truth and justice during the satyagraha campaign. The menu consisted of 24 dishes.
('8', 213, 1, 22, 517278) Meat being excluded, the courses were so chosen that they would be acceptable to everyone and could be liked equally by the whites and our people.
('8', 213, 1, 23, 517425) The drinks served were lime juice, soda water, etc.
('8', 213, 1, 24, 517477) It is said that this was the first gathering of its kind in South Africa.
('8', 213, 1, 25, 517551) The dinner was not publicized so as to avoid needless provo cation to the feelings of any whites.
('8', 213, 1, 26, 517649) It was kept strictly private.

('8', 214, 1, 2, 517724) DINNER BY CHINESE
('8', 214, 2, 3, 517742) The Chinese have arranged a meeting on Friday to present addresses, and on the same day, to give a dinner, similar to ours.
('8', 214, 2, 4, 517866) I shall report it next week.
('8', 214, 2, 5, 517895) REGISTRATION OFFICE Registration will come to an end here and in Pretoria on Friday next.
('8', 214, 2, 6, 517985) More than 5,000 applications were received in Johannesburg.
('8', 214, 2, 7, 518045) No one appears to have been left out.
('8', 214, 2, 8, 518083) The office will open in Pieters burg on the 30th.
('8', 214, 2, 9, 518133) Some persons have registered at Spelonken.
('8', 214, 2, 10, 518176) In Ger miston, the office will open on the 23rd.
('8', 214, 2, 11, 518225) Offices have already been set up at Zeerust, Lichtenburg, and Vereeniging.
('8', 214, 2, 12, 518300) In Zeerust and Lichten burg the officials, through some misunderstanding, insisted on every one giving his digit impressions or filing an affidavit.
('8', 214, 2, 13, 518449) The Association sent telegrams immediately with the result that proper arrangements have now been made.
('8', 214, 2, 14, 518553) LICENCES Licences are now available without difficulty.
('8', 214, 2, 15, 518609) Many persons have already got them.
('8', 214, 2, 16, 518645) TREACHERY There are Indians who still furnish wrong information to the Registrar.
('8', 214, 2, 17, 518727) Names of children are either mis stated or more names are furnished than there are children.
('8', 214, 2, 18, 518820) All this will redound to their disadvantage.
('8', 214, 2, 19, 518865) They should be mindful of what they do.
('8', 214, 2, 20, 518905) WOMENS FINGER IMPRESSIONS In Volksrust, women were asked to give their finger impressions.
('8', 214, 2, 21, 518996) However, the matter has now been settled to our satisfaction and finger impressions of Indian women are no longer asked for.
('8', 214, 2, 22, 519121) SUGGESTION ABOUT LICENCES The Receiver of Revenues has issued a special announcement that Indians will now be granted licences.
('8', 214, 2, 23, 519249) It is unnecessary even to produce the permit.
('8', 214, 2, 24, 519295) In spite of this, there are very few traders who have taken out licences.
('8', 214, 2, 25, 519369) Anyone who does not now take out a licence immediately will be prosecuted for trading without one.
('8', 214, 2, 26, 519468) It is therefore essential for all Indian businessmen and hawkers to get their licences.
('8', 214, 2, 27, 519556) JUSTICE AMEER ALI The members of the British Indian Association have resolved to send an address to Mr. Justice Ameer Ali, and it will be sent simultan eously with a similar one to Lord Ampthill.
('8', 214, 2, 28, 519752) Also, the Hamidia Islamic Society has decided to send addresses

('8', 215, 2, 4, 520050) 108. MY EXPERIENCE IN GAOL [ III]
('8', 215, 3, 5, 520084) Diet is a subject which most of us have to think about some time or other in our lives.
('8', 215, 3, 6, 520172) In particular, prisoners food requires the most careful consideration.
('8', 215, 3, 7, 520243) Their well being depends a great deal on a good diet.
('8', 215, 3, 8, 520297) The rule about food in gaol is that one must accept what is offered and take nothing from any other source.
('8', 215, 3, 9, 520405) Soldiers, too, must eat what is given them.
('8', 215, 3, 10, 520449) But there is a great difference between soldiers and prisoners.
('8', 215, 3, 11, 520513) Friends may send gifts of food to soldiers, which they may accept.
('8', 215, 3, 12, 520580) Prisoners, on the other hand, are forbidden to accept [gifts of] food.
('8', 215, 3, 13, 520651) Difficulty in regard to food is one important feature of prison life.
('8', 215, 3, 14, 520721) Even in casual conversation we hear gaol authorities saying that there can be no question of preferences in gaol.
('8', 215, 3, 15, 520835) When I met the gaol doctor, I asked that bread should be served with tea or ghee.
('8', 215, 3, 16, 520917) He replied: You want to indulge your taste.
('8', 215, 3, 17, 520961) That is not possible in gaol. Let us now consider the regulation food in gaol.
('8', 215, 3, 18, 521040) Indians get the following items of food during the first week: in the morning, twelve ounces of mealie pap without sugar or ghee; for the midday meal, fo ur ounces of rice with an ounce of ghee; in the evening, twelve ounces of mealie pap on four days and boiled beans with salt on three days.
('8', 215, 3, 19, 521334) This scale is drawn up on the basis of what the Kaffir prisoners get, with this difference that the Kaffirs are given pounded maize and fat in the evening, instead of which Indians get rice [for their midday meal].
('8', 215, 3, 20, 521549) From the second week onward, along with mealie meal, they get boiled potatoes on two days and vegetables, such as cabbage, pumpkin, on the other two.
('8', 215, 3, 21, 521699) To those who eat it, meat is also served with vegetables every Sunday from the second week onward.
('8', 215, 3, 22, 521798) The prisoners who were the first to arrive had decided not to ask for any favours from the Government but to make do with whatever food was allowed them, provided it was acceptable [from the religious standpoint].
('8', 215, 3, 23, 522012) In point of fact, the scale described above was neither adequate for Indians nor suited to them.
('8', 215, 3, 24, 522109) It may be that dietetically the food was sufficiently nutritious.
('8', 215, 3, 25, 522175) Mealie meal is the staple of Kaffir diet, so that this scale suits them very well and they thrive on it.
('8', 215, 3, 26, 522280) But nothing except rice is acceptable to Indians; hardly any of them eat
('8', 216, 0, 1, 522353) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 217
('8', 216, 1, 2, 522398) mealie pap.
('8', 216, 1, 3, 522410) Indians are not used to eating beans as a course in itself and do not find the vegetarian dishes [cooked in gaol] agreeable.
('8', 216, 1, 4, 522535) The vegetables are not washed, neither are they dressed with spices.
('8', 216, 1, 5, 522604) Moreover, the vegetables served to the Kaffir prisoners consist mostly of the leftovers and peelings from the vegetables cooked for the whites.
('8', 216, 1, 6, 522748) Nothing except salt is allowed by way of condiment.
('8', 216, 1, 7, 522800) Of sugar one may not even dream.
('8', 216, 1, 8, 522833) Everyone was therefore bothered by the problem of food.
('8', 216, 1, 9, 522889) Even so, we resolved that 3S satyagrahis we should not ask for anything from the gaol authorities nor seek a favour So we carried on with the food described above.
('8', 216, 1, 10, 523053) When the Governor enquired [about the amenities], we told him that our food was unsatisfactory, but that we did not wish to ask for a favour from the Government.
('8', 216, 1, 11, 523215) It was for the Government to consider whether they should make changes.
('8', 216, 1, 12, 523287) Otherwise, we would make do with whatever the regulations allowed.
('8', 216, 1, 13, 523354) This attitude could not be kept up for long.
('8', 216, 1, 14, 523399) When others joined us, we agreed that it would not be proper for us to compel them to accept this inconvenience as we did.
('8', 216, 1, 15, 523522) That they had come to gaol was [sacrifice] enough.
('8', 216, 1, 16, 523573) It would be proper, we thought, to demand from the Government special treatment for these people.
('8', 216, 1, 17, 523671) To that end webroached the subject with the Governor.
('8', 216, 1, 18, 523725) We told him that, though we accepted whatever was given to us, those who came after us would not be able to do so.
('8', 216, 1, 19, 523840) The Governor thought the matter over and answered that he could [permit] cooking to meet any religious scruples, but that the food itself should remain the same.
('8', 216, 1, 20, 524002) It was not within his power to effect any changes in it.
('8', 216, 1, 21, 524059) Meanwhile, as mentioned earlier, 1 14 other Indians joined us.
('8', 216, 1, 22, 524122) Some of them plainly refused to eat mealie pap.
('8', 216, 1, 23, 524170) They starved.
('8', 216, 1, 24, 524184) I went through the gaol regulations, and discovered that a petition on this subject could be addressed to the Director of Prisons.
('8', 216, 1, 25, 524315) We therefore asked for the Governors permission to address a petition, and the following petition 2 was forwarded.
('8', 216, 1, 26, 524430) This petition was signed by 21 of us.
('8', 216, 1, 27, 524468) After it had been signed and was about to be submitted, we were joined by another 76 Indians, who also disliked mealie pap.
('8', 216, 1, 28, 524592) We therefore added at the end of the petition that the 76 persons do had come in also felt the same difficulty, and that immediate orders should therefore be issued.
('8', 216, 1, 29, 524758) I requested the Governor to telegraph the contents of this petition.
('8', 216, 2, 30, 524827) 1Vide My Experience in Gaol [ II], 14 3 1908 2 This has not been re translated; for English text, vide Petition to Director of Prisons, 21 1 1908. The last two sentences from it are, however, missing in the Gujarati translation.
('8', 217, 0, 1, 525056) 218 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 217, 1, 2, 525098) consented and, after obtaining the permission of the Director on telephone, ordered mealie pap to be replaced by four ounces of bread [for each prisoner].
('8', 217, 1, 3, 525253) All of us were happy.
('8', 217, 1, 4, 525275) From the 22nd, therefore, we got four ounces of bread in the morning, as also in the evening, [that is,] on mealie pap days.
('8', 217, 1, 5, 525400) In the evening eight ounces of bread was provided, that is, half a loaf.
('8', 217, 1, 6, 525473) This arrangement was only provisional, pending further orders.
('8', 217, 1, 7, 525536) The Governor had meanwhile appointed a committee to go into thisquestion.
('8', 217, 1, 8, 525610) In the end, it was proposed to allow us flour, ghee, rice and pulses.
('8', 217, 1, 9, 525680) Nothing further happened and we were released soon after.
('8', 217, 1, 10, 525738) When, in the beginning, we were only eight, none of us did any cooking.
('8', 217, 1, 11, 525810) The rice was not well cooked and in their turn, the green vegetables, too, were cooked badly.
('8', 217, 1, 12, 525904) Therefore, we also obtained per mission to cook our own meals.
('8', 217, 1, 13, 525967) On the first day, Mr. Karwa offered to cook.
('8', 217, 1, 14, 526012) He was then replaced by Mr. Thambi Naidoo and Mr. Jivan.
('8', 217, 1, 15, 526069) During the last few days they cooked for 150 persons and had to cook once a day.
('8', 217, 1, 16, 526150) Two days in the week, however, that is, on the green vege table days, they had to go twice a day [to cook].
('8', 217, 1, 17, 526258) Mr. Thambi Naidoo did an admirable job of work, and I looked after the serving.
('8', 217, 1, 18, 526338) The readers will observe from the foregoing petition that it is drafted so as to present a case not for preferential treatment for ourselves alone, but for a modification of the food scale for all Indian prisoners.
('8', 217, 1, 19, 526553) It was in the same light that the matter was placed before the Governor, and he concurred.
('8', 217, 1, 20, 526644) There is still hope that the ration for Indian prisoners in gaols will be modified.
('8', 217, 1, 21, 526728) Moreover, the three Chinese were given something else in place of the rice that we got and were thus the only ones to be refused rice.
('8', 217, 1, 22, 526863) This caused some heart burning.
('8', 217, 1, 23, 526895) It appeared as though the Chinese were being discriminated against as a class inferior to us.
('8', 217, 1, 24, 526989) I therefore wrote out a petition 1 on their behalf to the Governor and to Mr. Playford.
('8', 217, 1, 25, 527077) The order was finally passed that the Chinese should get the same food as the Indians.
('8', 217, 1, 26, 527164) While on the subject of food, it will be instructive to compare [the Indian] with the European scale.
('8', 217, 1, 27, 527266) For breakfast, they get porridge with eight ounces of bread.
('8', 217, 1, 28, 527327) For dinner, again, bread, together with soup or meat with potatoes or green vegetables, and for supper, bread and porridge.
('8', 217, 1, 29, 527451) That is, Europeans get bread thrice a day, so that it makes no difference whether or not they get porridge.
('8', 217, 1, 30, 527559) Moreover, they are served either meat or soup as an additional item every day.
('8', 217, 1, 31, 527638) Over and above these they are given tea or cocoa every afternoon.
('8', 217, 1, 32, 527704) It is thus
('8', 217, 2, 33, 527715) 1 Not available
('8', 218, 0, 1, 527731) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 219
('8', 218, 1, 2, 527776) clear that both Kaffirs and Europeans get food suited to their tastes.
('8', 218, 1, 3, 527847) The poor Indiansnobody bothers about them!
('8', 218, 1, 4, 527890) They cannot get the food they want.
('8', 218, 1, 5, 527926) If they are given European diet, the whites will feel insulted.
('8', 218, 1, 6, 527990) In any case, why should the gaol authorities bother to find out the normal Indian fare?
('8', 218, 1, 7, 528078) There is nothing for it but to let ourselves be classed with the Kaffirs and starve.
('8', 218, 1, 8, 528163) That this state of affairs has gone on till today points, in my view, to a deficiency in our satyagraha.
('8', 218, 1, 9, 528268) Some Indian prisoners get extra food from without surreptitiously.
('8', 218, 1, 10, 528335) They, therefore, suffer no inconvenience on this account.
('8', 218, 1, 11, 528393) There are other Indian prisoners who make do with whateverthey are given, and [afterwards] feel ashamed of mentioning their misfortunes or do not care enough for others [to take up the issue].
('8', 218, 1, 12, 528586) People outside remain in the dark [about what happens in goal].
('8', 218, 1, 13, 528650) If we were all devoted to truth and remonstrated whenever there was injustice, we would never have to suffer these inconveniences.
('8', 218, 1, 14, 528781) If we think more of others than of ourselves, it will be easy to find solutions for these problems.
('8', 218, 1, 15, 528881) If it is necessary to find remedies for these problems, it is also necessary to bear another consideration in mind.
('8', 218, 1, 16, 528997) A prisoner must submit to certain hardships.
('8', 218, 1, 17, 529042) If there were no hardships, what would be the point of being imprisoned?
('8', 218, 1, 18, 529115) Those who can control their minds can find happiness even amidst hardships and enjoy being in gaol.
('8', 218, 1, 19, 529215) Such persons, however, will not forget the hardships [of gaol life], and, for the sake of others, they ought not to.
('8', 218, 1, 20, 529332) Moreover, we should give up clinging so tenaciously to our customs and habits.
('8', 218, 1, 21, 529411) Everyone has heard of the saying, As the country, so the attire.
('8', 218, 1, 22, 529476) Since we live in South Africa we must accustom ourselves to whatever is wholesome in the food of the people here.
('8', 218, 1, 23, 529590) Mealie pap, like wheat, is good, simple and cheap food.
('8', 218, 1, 24, 529646) Neither can it be said to be tasteless.
('8', 218, 1, 25, 529686) In fact, for some purposes, mealie pap is better than wheat.
('8', 218, 1, 26, 529747) I also believe that, out of regard for the country in which we live, we must accept the food grown in the soil of that country, provided of course it is not unwhol esome.
('8', 218, 1, 27, 529918) Many whites have mealie pap for breakfast every day because they like it.
('8', 218, 1, 28, 529992) With milk, sugar or ghee, it can be made palatable.
('8', 218, 1, 29, 530044) Bea ring these considerations in mind, and also because there may be many occasions yet for us to go to gaol, we should all get used to mealie pap.
('8', 218, 1, 30, 530192) If we do that, eating mealie pap with only salt will not appear so much of an ordeal.
('8', 218, 1, 31, 530278) There are some habits of ours which we must not hesitate to give up in the interests of our country.

('8', 219, 3, 6, 530708) [Before March 26, 1908] 2
('8', 219, 4, 7, 530734) Q. What number of Indians are there in the Transvaal and from what parts of India do they chiefly come?
('8', 219, 5, 8, 530838) A. There are about 13,000. At present the number resident here is only about 8,000; the remaining 5,000 have left in consequence of the Registration Act.
('8', 219, 5, 9, 530992) Some are in Natal and some in Cape Town but the majority have returned to India.
('8', 219, 5, 10, 531073) Probably most of them will now return.
('8', 219, 5, 11, 531112) Those who are resident here have come chiefly from Bombay and Madras, and are mostly general traders or hawkers.
('8', 219, 6, 12, 531225) Q. What is the history of the settlement of Indians in the Transvaal?
('8', 219, 7, 13, 531295) A. In 1843, indentured labour was first introduced into Natal.
('8', 219, 7, 14, 531358) Afterwards it was suspended.
('8', 219, 7, 15, 531387) Then the prosperity of the Colony declined and in 1853 indentured labour was again resorted to.
('8', 219, 7, 16, 531483) There was a large Indian settlement in Mauritius, and one of the Bombay Indians there, hearing that Indians did well in Natal, came there, bringing with him a large number of his relatives and fellow caste men.
('8', 219, 7, 17, 531694) He prospered, and other Indians hearing of this, came on the scene and so Indian traders multiplied.
('8', 219, 7, 18, 531795) When the Transvaal mines were opened up, these traders came over from Natal and soon became prosperous.
('8', 219, 7, 19, 531899) They found that they could trade not only with their own countrymen, but also with the Kafirs and the Dutch.
('8', 219, 7, 20, 532008) They found the Dutch trade specially remunerative, and so the number of Indian traders increased.
('8', 219, 8, 21, 532106) Q. I have heard it said that you have made special efforts to increase the Indian trading community and to bring in Indian artisans.
('8', 219, 8, 22, 532239) Is this true?
('8', 219, 9, 23, 532253) A. There is not a vestige of truth in it.
('8', 219, 9, 24, 532295) I first came into the country in 1893, when things were much as they are now.
('8', 219, 9, 25, 532373) There were then fully eight or nine thousand Indians in the country.
('8', 219, 9, 26, 532442) The increase which has since taken place is small, and I have done absolutely

('8', 220, 1, 2, 532702) nothing to increase the community.
('8', 220, 2, 3, 532737) Q. Before the recent Registration Law was brought into force, what was the system of registration adopted?
('8', 220, 3, 4, 532844) A. There was no registration of the present kind in existence.
('8', 220, 3, 5, 532907) In 1885, the Dutch Government passed a law 1 dealing with immigration, but that law was not intended to restrict the immigration of Indians but it was meant to place a bar upon their trading.
('8', 220, 3, 6, 533099) At one time President Kruger passed a law imposing a prohibitive fee of  25 on every Indian who wished to trade in the country.
('8', 220, 3, 7, 533227) The technical wording of the Law was that any Indian desiring to trade should be registered and take out a receipt for  25. In consequence of representations made by the British Government the amount of the fee was subsequently reduced to 3. It will be seen that this Law simply imposed a trade tax on Indian traders, and was not a registration act applicable to Indians as a class.
('8', 220, 4, 8, 533610) A. But is not the present Act stated to be an amendment of the old Dutch Law to which you refer?
('8', 220, 5, 9, 533707) A. Yes, but my conviction is that this was done with a view to hoodwink the British public.
('8', 220, 5, 10, 533799) As a matter of fact the present Act differs in toto from the old Dutch Law.
('8', 220, 5, 11, 533875) That applied only to traders and did not touch the community as a class, this Act embraces all, without distinction, and aims not simply at registration but also at identifi cation.
('8', 220, 5, 12, 534057) The old Dutch Law did not aim at preventing Indian immig ration, neither did it concern itself with identification.
('8', 220, 5, 13, 534173) It merely required that all traders should register and contribute to the revenue by paying a specified fee.
('8', 220, 6, 14, 534282) Q. What is the system of permits and how long has it been in force?
('8', 220, 7, 15, 534350) A. After the conclusion of peace, an ordinance was passed to take the place of the procedure adopted under martial law, when every resident was more or less under supervision.
('8', 220, 7, 16, 534526) To replace martial law an ordinance called the Peace Preservation Ordinance was passed.
('8', 220, 7, 17, 534614) The preamble states that it was passed to check the entry of people of a dangerous character, who would be a menace to peace and good government, that is to say, it was aimed at disloyalists.
('8', 220, 7, 18, 534806) But later when a cry was raised against the immigration of Indians this Ordinance was effectively applied to that end.
('8', 220, 7, 19, 534925) When the Ordinance was passed it was designed to guard against the influx of undesirable people, but permits were granted freely to any British subject of whose good character they were satisfied, and to foreigners who could produce certificates from their Consuls.

('8', 221, 0, 1, 535207) 222 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 221, 1, 2, 535249) since this agitation against Indians has arisen, they have been singled out for exceptional treatment and required to give elaborate proof that they were in the country before the War, before a permit is granted.
('8', 221, 2, 3, 535462) Q. It has been stated that there had arisen a widespread traffic in the permits issued to Indians, and that there was an illicit influx of Asiatics on an organized scale which alarmed the authorities and necessitated the introduction of this severe measure.
('8', 221, 2, 4, 535720) Is this true?
('8', 221, 3, 5, 535734) A. This charge was made against our community and we approached the authorities and asked them for proofs.
('8', 221, 3, 6, 535841) 1 This they could not or would not give.
('8', 221, 3, 7, 535882) I admit that there was some traffic in permits going on, but behind the traffic, and regulating and profiting by it, were the officials of the Government.
('8', 221, 3, 8, 536037) The real facts are these after the conclusion of peace a considerable number of Euro peans from the Volunteers were taken on by the Government and placed in positions of trust and responsibility.
('8', 221, 3, 9, 536233) It is not surprising that many proved themselves utterly unfitted for positions for which they had no previous training, and that some proved utterly untrustworthy, Several men of this class were appointed as supervisors of Asiatics.
('8', 221, 3, 10, 536467) They were given tremendous powers and they held the physical destiny of Indians in their hands.
('8', 221, 3, 11, 536563) They did not scruple to take full advantage of their positions for their own enrichment.
('8', 221, 3, 12, 536652) They inau gurated a regular system of traffic in permits, and either granted or transferred them at rates varying from  10 to  30. Where the carcass is, there the crows will gather, and when it became known that permits could be obtained for a consideration, Indians came to the Transvaal from Durban, Port Elizabeth, Cape Town and elsewhere.
('8', 221, 3, 13, 536995) Many of these had a perfect right to re enter but had to buy their permits.
('8', 221, 4, 14, 537071) Q. But why did not the respectable leaders of your community endeavour to stop the traffic?
('8', 221, 5, 15, 537163) A. They did.
('8', 221, 5, 16, 537176) When I returned from India in 1902 I found the traffic in full swing.
('8', 221, 5, 17, 537246) I then warned my fellow countrymen of what could be the results if the traffic was not stopped.
('8', 221, 5, 18, 537342) I came from India at that time specially to meet Mr. Joseph Chamberlain.
('8', 221, 5, 19, 537415) I brought the matter to the notice of Sir Arthur Lawley 2 but he would not listen, for he trusted his officers.
('8', 221, 5, 20, 537527) Three times I approached him with a view to stopping this abuse and on the third occasion I produced such proof that an enquiry was made and two officials were discharged on a technicality, but the evidence before Government was so clear that both officers were dismissed from service.
('8', 221, 5, 21, 537813) This illicit traffic had to be stopped, but it could have been done effectively without the legislation

('8', 222, 1, 2, 538030) recently introduced.
('8', 222, 1, 3, 538051) The authors of the malpractice, the active agents in carrying it out, and those who profited by it were these corrupt officials, but instead of using the power which existing laws placed at their disposal for dealing with the evil, the Government introduced an act directed against the whole Indian community.
('8', 222, 2, 4, 538361) Q. I gather then that you regard this Registration Act as unnecessary and based on assumptions which are untrue.
('8', 222, 3, 5, 538474) A. Certainly.
('8', 222, 3, 6, 538488) It proceeds on the assumption that every Indian has entered the country fraudulently, and treats his permits as invalid untilhe rehabilitates himself by producing before the Registrar evidence of his bonafides, which he can accept.
('8', 222, 3, 7, 538720) It invalidatestotally the Dutch registration certificates, for which a fee of 3 was paid, although it professes to be in harmony with the Law under which those certificates were granted.
('8', 222, 3, 8, 538907) It assumes that Turkish Mahomedans are less trustworthy than Turkish Christians and Jews, for it exempts the two latter classes from the provisions of the Act.
('8', 222, 3, 9, 539067) Thus, for these and other reasons, it has deeply offended both Hindus and Mahomedans.
('8', 222, 4, 10, 539153) Q. What other objections have you to urge against the Act?
('8', 222, 5, 11, 539212) A. First, it curtails our liberty in such a manner that no self respecting man, who has faith in God, could submit to it.
('8', 222, 5, 12, 539334) A man may, voluntarily and for the benefit of his community, submit to many restrictions, but in this case, the community gains nothing.
('8', 222, 5, 13, 539471) If any man submitted, it would be solely for the sake of gaining money.
('8', 222, 5, 14, 539543) Secondly, the distinction made between Turkish Mahomedans and Turkish Christians and Jews is most invidious.
('8', 222, 5, 15, 539652) They all come from the same social class and in many cases the Christians and Jews from Turkey are far lower in the social scale, yet they are exempted from the provisions of the Act.
('8', 222, 5, 16, 539836) Is it to be wondered at that the Mahomedans feel aggrieved?
('8', 222, 5, 17, 539896) Throughout the history of Colonial Government legislation, the Government have set their face firmly against class legislation except under very extraordinary circumstances.
('8', 222, 5, 18, 540070) The Australian Immigration Act was vetoed by Mr. Chamberlain because it was class legislation.
('8', 222, 5, 19, 540165) He would not allow the late Mr. Escombe, the Premier of Natal, to pass an act against Asiatics and he advised the Natal Ministry to introduce a general act, dealing with the evil they sought to remove not on the basis of colour, or religion, but on general grounds.
('8', 222, 5, 20, 540431) Yet the Imperial Government agreed to this Act which I regard as class legislation of a most virulent type.
('8', 222, 5, 21, 540539) Other objectionable features of the Act are the following.
('8', 222, 5, 22, 540598) Child ren under eight years have to be registered by their parents under a heavy penalty.
('8', 222, 5, 23, 540688) Those over eight years have to be taken before the
('8', 223, 0, 1, 540739) 224 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 223, 1, 2, 540781) Registrar and made to give all identification particulars required of them.
('8', 223, 1, 3, 540857) On attaining the age of 16, they have to appear again before the Registrar and take out certificates.
('8', 223, 1, 4, 540959) I can only describe this as scientific torture.
('8', 223, 1, 5, 541007) Again, the method of identification adopted is the one pursued for the identification of criminals in this country.
('8', 223, 1, 6, 541123) No absolutely free men have ever been required to submit to such a process hitherto.
('8', 223, 1, 7, 541208) I may mention that probably in order to remove the objection which we Indians feel digit impressions have been made of general application under the Immigration Act.
('8', 223, 1, 8, 541374) This it is said will apply to Europeans as well as others, but this is manifestly an aftert hought and I doubt if it will be largely enforced.
('8', 223, 1, 9, 541517) You will not therefore be surprised that when the Act was passed, the Indians met and took a solemn oath that they would not submit to such a Law.
('8', 223, 2, 10, 541664) Q. What steps were taken to make the authorities acquainted with your objections to the Act?
('8', 223, 3, 11, 541757) A. The measure was published only a few days before it was to come up for discussion.
('8', 223, 3, 12, 541843) Immediately representatives of the Indian community sought an interview with Mr. Patrick Duncan, the Colonial Secretary 2, and I personally saw Sir Richard Solomon.
('8', 223, 3, 13, 542008) Mr. Duncan informed the deputation that they could discuss with him the details of the measure but not the principles, as the Government were committed to them.
('8', 223, 3, 14, 542169) The Indians then presented a petition to the Legislative Assembly.
('8', 223, 3, 15, 542236) That was pigeon holed and the Law was passed as it stood, with one important alteration.
('8', 223, 3, 16, 542325) The draft measure applied to Indian women as well as men.
('8', 223, 3, 17, 542383) This will show you how far they were prepared to go and how little those who drafted the Act understood Indian sentiment.
('8', 223, 3, 18, 542505) The measure was passed; then came the meeting in the Empire Theatre, when the community took an oath of passive resistance.
('8', 223, 3, 19, 542629) 3 A deputation was appointed to go to London to interview Lord Elgin 4. When they reached London they met with much sympathy from Anglo Indians, and the Press, including The Times, supported their cause.
('8', 223, 3, 20, 542833) Lord Elgin was alarmed, and said that after hearing all the facts he could not agree to the Act as it then stood, and accordingly it was then vetoed.
('8', 223, 3, 21, 542983) Then responsible government was granted, and their first

('8', 224, 1, 2, 543279) act was to reintroduce this measure word for word.
('8', 224, 1, 3, 543330) The passing of the measure through both the Houses of the Legislature occupied about 48 hours.
('8', 224, 1, 4, 543425) 1 We Indians again petitioned, appealed by telegraph to the Home authorities, 2 interviewed General Smuts 3 but all was of no avail.
('8', 224, 1, 5, 543558) The measure received the Royal Assent.
('8', 224, 1, 6, 543597) 4 The Indian community again met and reaffirmed their vow of non compliance, and since then passive resistance has been going on.
('8', 224, 1, 7, 543727) 5 The registration offices were opened but only 500 Indians 6 submitted.
('8', 224, 2, 8, 543800) Q. What was the next step taken by Government?
('8', 224, 3, 9, 543847) A. The Government then passed the Immigrants Restriction Act.
('8', 224, 3, 10, 543909) 7 This act was of general application, but two clauses were incorporated in order to meet passive resisters.
('8', 224, 3, 11, 544018) Under the Registration Act Indians who did not submit to its requirements could be sent to jail for two years with hard labour, but under the Immigration Act, all Indians who did not submit to registration could be physically deported at their own cost, their chattels, if any, being sold to defray expenses.
('8', 224, 3, 12, 544327) The second clause provided that those Indians who were resident here, but did not submit to the Law, no matter of what standing they were, became prohibited immigrants and therefore subject to deporta tion.
('8', 224, 3, 13, 544534) This measure, instead of unmanning the Indians, nerved them for further struggle and they informed the Government that they would suffer deportation and confiscation of property but would not violate their conscience and break their oath.
('8', 224, 3, 14, 544773) Those Indians who could not stand the stress of the struggle went out of the country.
('8', 224, 3, 15, 544859) Many sold cut their businesses, others who remained here counter manded their orders for further supplies of goods, while yet others sold out and remained, living on their capital, in order to carry on the struggle.
('8', 224, 3, 16, 545075) The Government resorted to all kinds of methods to influence the Indians into compliance.
('8', 224, 3, 17, 545165) They dismissed their Indian employees in the post offices, railways, and other departments, and these in nearly every case accepted their dismissal rather than comply

('8', 225, 1, 2, 545743) with the Act.
('8', 225, 1, 3, 545757) Then followed imprisonment 1 and nearly 200 Indians including myself and most of the leaders were put in jail, 2 and the licences of traders were stopped.
('8', 225, 1, 4, 545912) The utmost firmness was manifested by all classes of the community and even women came forward andheld meetings and informed Government that they were fully prepared to follow their husbands.
('8', 225, 2, 5, 546104) Q. What kind of treatment did you receive in prison?
('8', 225, 3, 6, 546157) A. The jail authorities did their best for us, but the treatment can only be described as inhuman.
('8', 225, 3, 7, 546256) We were treated as common felons and were put on a diet to which Indians are altogether unaccustomed, with the result that we were practically starved.
('8', 225, 3, 8, 546408) For breakfast we were given mealie meal, which is a porridge, all right for the natives of this country who have always been used to it, but to us it was most distasteful.
('8', 225, 3, 9, 546580) Many refused it altogether, others who took it rather than starve suffered from dysentery, etc.
('8', 225, 3, 10, 546676) In response to a petition, we were allowed four ounces of bread in lieu of the meal.
('8', 225, 3, 11, 546761) 3 This we had to eat without tea or coffee, only water was allowed.
('8', 225, 3, 12, 546829) For dinner we had four ounces of rice and one ounce of ghee.
('8', 225, 3, 13, 546890) For supper we were given eight ounces of bread three times a week, and three times we had haricot beans, without any accompaniment.
('8', 225, 3, 14, 547022) On Sundays we could have had meat if we desired, but as Hindus do not eat meat and Mahomedans cannot eat it unless the animals have been slain according to their own formula, the meat was not accepted.
('8', 225, 3, 15, 547224) In place of this we were allowed a double quantity of vegetables.
('8', 225, 3, 16, 547290) Asiatic prisoners are classed with Natives.
('8', 225, 3, 17, 547334) I do not object to this, but I claim that they should be supplied with food according to their customs.
('8', 225, 3, 18, 547438) The accommodation also was very bad.
('8', 225, 3, 19, 547475) The jail where we were housed has provision for only 51 prisoners, but when I was there, 151 4
('8', 225, 4, 20, 547570) had to be dealt with.
('8', 225, 4, 21, 547592) Tents were erected in an open space which provided sleeping accommodation for one hundred, but during the day time the whole 151 were crowded into a small yard, with the result that almost every day som e fainted away at the time of inspection.

('8', 226, 1, 2, 548268) A. The Government accepted our offer of voluntary registration according to a form ultimately agreed to.
('8', 226, 1, 3, 548373) 1 This offer had been made before 2 the Act was brought into operation and if it had been accepted then, all subsequent evil might have been avoided.
('8', 226, 1, 4, 548523) By mutual agreement, the form of registration has been altered.
('8', 226, 1, 5, 548587) If any man has scruples against giving his ten digits, he may give only his thumb mark.
('8', 226, 1, 6, 548675) The Pathans have done this and most of the Chinese.
('8', 226, 1, 7, 548727) Personally, I have registered and given the prints ofmy ten digits.
('8', 226, 1, 8, 548795) I did this for the sake of example and to show that while I would voluntarily do anything not intrinsically bad I would do nothing by coercion.
('8', 226, 1, 9, 548939) The whole objection was against the spirit of the Act.
('8', 226, 1, 10, 548994) We have received the distinct assurance of Government that if the bulk of the Indian community voluntarily register the Act will be repealed.
('8', 226, 1, 11, 549136) There are sections of the Act which apply to Indians subsequent to their registration; these will become a dead letter.
('8', 226, 1, 12, 549256) Registration on these terms is now going on rapidly and I anticipate that nearly all our community will comply.
('8', 226, 2, 13, 549368) Q. How was the settlement brought about?
('8', 226, 3, 14, 549409) A. The settlement was bought about largely through the intervention of Mr. Cartwright 3, the editor of The Transvaal Leader.
('8', 226, 3, 15, 549534) He knew me personally in London and was in touch with General Smuts.
('8', 226, 3, 16, 549603) Having reason to believe that Government would be open to accept the original offer of voluntary registration, he came to me in the jail, and asked if we were still prepared to abide by our original proposal.
('8', 226, 3, 17, 549812) We said we were.
('8', 226, 3, 18, 549829) He then produced a draft letter which he had written to General Smuts embodying the proposal, and this letter with a few corrections I signed.
('8', 226, 3, 19, 549972) 4 After consultation with the leaders of the Progressive Party, and obtaining their consent, General Smuts sent for me 5. I left the jail, under police escort for Pretoria and there discussed the whole matter with General Smuts.
('8', 226, 3, 20, 550201) I returned the same day at 10.45 p.m.
('8', 226, 3, 21, 550239) and at a meeting of our community held at midnight, I informed them of the settlement offered and strongly

('8', 227, 1, 2, 550688) urged them to accept it.
('8', 227, 1, 3, 550713) 1 The finger prints was an open question and all authorized me to accept the finger prints in the modified form.
('8', 227, 1, 4, 550826) All accepted it except the Pathans, about one hundred and fifty in number.
('8', 227, 1, 5, 550901) The next day all the prisoners were released.
('8', 227, 2, 6, 550947) Q. What led to the murderous assault upon you?
('8', 227, 3, 7, 550994) A. I have already stated that at the meeting held after my return from Pretoria the Pathans refused to agree to the finger prints.
('8', 227, 3, 8, 551125) At a meeting held subsequently 2 they still protested and used threats.
('8', 227, 3, 9, 551197) I endeavoured to show them that the compromise was an honourable one.
('8', 227, 3, 10, 551267) We did not object to registration but to coercion and I expressed my determination to be the first to present myself at the registration office.
('8', 227, 3, 11, 551412) The Pathans threatened that the first Indian who attended for registration and to give finger prints would be killed.
('8', 227, 3, 12, 551530) Disregarding this threat many others and I set out 3 for the registration office and on the way, I was set upon by some Pathans, who aimed a blow at me, which was intended to be fatal.
('8', 227, 3, 13, 551715) It missed its mark but I received a severe gash on my face, and was rendered unconscious.
('8', 227, 3, 14, 551805) When I recovered I refused to bring a charge against my assailants, but the Government took the case up and two Pathans received three months imprisonment with hard labour.
('8', 227, 3, 15, 551978) Since then the Pathans themselves have registered, giving their single thumb prints, and I believe that everything will now work harmoniously.
('8', 227, 3, 16, 552121) I do not blame the Pathans.
('8', 227, 3, 17, 552149) To them finger prints was the Law.
('8', 227, 3, 18, 552184) They could, as they did, register without finger prints.
('8', 227, 3, 19, 552241) Suspicious by nature they could not understand why I should give ten digit prints.

('8', 228, 4, 16, 553578) I hope you will keep in constant touch with Mr. Polak.

('8', 229, 2, 3, 554811) Cables from India report Lord Minto as having said in a speech that, owing to the famine in Central India, five crores of people were faced with the prospect of starvation, and that if no relief was provided, they would simply die off [for want of food grains].
('8', 229, 2, 4, 555073) Is there any Indian who did not shudder at this news or whose heart did not cry out?
('8', 229, 2, 5, 555158) However, some of us may have felt that there is nothing that we can do from this distance.
('8', 229, 2, 6, 555249) Others may have thought that, in a situa tion such as this, they could not have helped matters much even if they had been in India.
('8', 229, 2, 7, 555381) Since the calamity is the result of a goddesss wrath, they feel helpless.
('8', 229, 2, 8, 555455) There must also be some who blame this on the British Government.
('8', 229, 2, 9, 555521) We think that all these persons are wrong.
('8', 229, 2, 10, 555564) It is a common habit to point to the faults of others and not to see ones own.
('8', 229, 2, 11, 555643) Others mistakes attract ready attention.
('8', 229, 2, 12, 555684) Let us, however, go dee per into the question.
('8', 229, 2, 13, 555731) We are convinced that, though this condition is undoubtedly the result of divine will, the blame lies with us, our chief fault being that we have very little truth in us.
('8', 229, 2, 14, 555902) It is generally from experience that the whites accuse us of untruthfulness Not all of them accuse us out of malice.
('8', 229, 2, 15, 556019) We are annoyed by the charge.
('8', 229, 2, 16, 556049) It instead of feeling annoyed, we look at the matter in the right perspective and ponder over it, we may derive much profit.
('8', 229, 2, 17, 556174) The Indians here are not very different from those at home.
('8', 229, 2, 18, 556234) If we take examples from the Transvaal or Natal, we shall find that untruthfulness is spreading among us.
('8', 229, 2, 19, 556340) This untruthfulness does us dramage.
('8', 229, 2, 20, 556377) Instead of getting rid of the habit we fight the Government and inveigh against it When the Government adopts extreme measures, we are Admittedly left with no choice but to fight.
('8', 229, 2, 21, 556557) But fighting the Government will not by itself bring us happiness It is necessary that we fight ourselves.
('8', 229, 2, 22, 556664) We must overcome this habit of deceitfulness.
('8', 229, 2, 23, 556710) In our private lives we behave as we do with the Government.
('8', 229, 2, 24, 556771) The result is that we become cowardly and, in order to cover up our cowardice, we resort to deception and hypocrisy at every turn.
('8', 229, 2, 25, 556902) In Natal, we spend any amount of money to obtain trading licences by underhand means, but we will not observe cleanniness, which is the thing necessary.
('8', 229, 2, 26, 557055) There are very few Indians who deserve trading licences on merits.
('8', 229, 2, 27, 557122) In the Transvaal everyone thinks only of self interest They must have a permit by Sir means or but As many children as possible must
('8', 230, 0, 1, 557255) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 231
('8', 230, 1, 2, 557300) be brought into the Colony.
('8', 230, 1, 3, 557328) This avidity [to have all one wants] X, to be sure, a source of evil.
('8', 230, 1, 4, 557398) These are examples which are easy to follow.
('8', 230, 1, 5, 557443) Many other instances of falsehood can be cited.
('8', 230, 1, 6, 557491) Some readers may wonder what the connection is between fraudulent practice in relation to permits in the Transvaal and trading licences in Natal on the one hand and famine on the other.
('8', 230, 1, 7, 557677) That we do not perceive this connection is in itself an error.
('8', 230, 1, 8, 557740) Our examples are only symptoms of a chronic disease within us.
('8', 230, 1, 9, 557803) We are sure that, as long as they remain addicted to cheating and deception, Indians will never be rid of their troubles.
('8', 230, 1, 10, 557925) It would be a great and true help indeed it instead of sending money from here or being useful.
('8', 230, 1, 11, 558021) in some other way, a reformed ourselves and learnt to be truthful.
('8', 230, 1, 12, 558088) If the Indians here observe truth in word and deed and behave with courage, that cannot but have some effect in India.
('8', 230, 1, 13, 558207) Pain in any part of the body is felt by the mind.
('8', 230, 1, 14, 558257) The healthy condition of a part Was a benign effect [on the whole].
('8', 230, 1, 15, 558325) Similarly, good or bad actions of individuals have a corresponding effect on a whole people.
('8', 230, 1, 16, 558418) We believe this to be a divine law, and if our readers agree that it is so, we think the only real help the kind hearted among the Indians can render to their country is to take the path of truthfulness immediately after reading the heart rending account of starvation among five crores of Indians.
('8', 230, 1, 17, 558717) This is admittedly a difficult step to take.
('8', 230, 1, 18, 558762) But it is also a very effective one.
('8', 230, 1, 19, 558799) After a little reflection, anyone will realize that this is the only solution.

('8', 230, 3, 22, 558952) PATIENTS
('8', 230, 4, 23, 558961) It would have been surprising if not one among 150 of us had been taken ill.
('8', 230, 4, 24, 559038) The first casualty was Samunder Khan.
('8', 230, 4, 25, 559076) He was ill even when he came to gaol and so was removed to hospital the day after his arrival.
('8', 230, 4, 26, 559171) Mr. Karwa had an attack of rheumatism.
('8', 230, 4, 27, 559210) for some the doctor treated him with ointment, etc., in the gaol.
('8', 230, 4, 28, 559276) But later, he, too, was admitted to hospital.
('8', 230, 4, 29, 559322) Two other prisoners fell sick and were removed to hospital.
('8', 230, 4, 30, 559382) Since it was hot and the prisoners were exposed to the sun outside some of them fell sick occasionally.
('8', 230, 4, 31, 559486) They were treated as well as they could be [in goal].
('8', 230, 4, 32, 559540) Towards the end, Mr. Nawab Khan was also taken ill and, the day of his release, he had to be helped to walk.
('8', 231, 0, 1, 559649) 232 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 231, 1, 2, 559691) improved after the doctor permitted him to drink milk.
('8', 231, 1, 3, 559746) However, on the whole, the satyagrahi prisoners kept well.
('8', 231, 2, 4, 559805) LACK OF SPACE
('8', 231, 3, 5, 559819) I mentioned earlier that our ward could accommodate 51 prisoners.
('8', 231, 3, 6, 559885) The yard in front had the same capacity.
('8', 231, 3, 7, 559926) When, towards the end, our number increased beyond 151, we experienced acute inconvenience The Governor ordered tents to be pitched outside, and some of us were shifted to these.
('8', 231, 3, 8, 560105) During the last few days, a hundred prisoners had to sleep outside.
('8', 231, 3, 9, 560173) But they were brought back every morning, with the result that the yard turned out to be too small, and it was with great difficulty that room could be found for all the prisoners.
('8', 231, 3, 10, 560354) On top of this, when we indulged in our vice of spitting were, there was danger of the place becoming dirty and infected.
('8', 231, 3, 11, 560476) Fortunately, people were amenable to persuasion and helped keep the yard clean.
('8', 231, 3, 12, 560556) That how they managed to avoid illness.
('8', 231, 3, 13, 560596) Anyone will admit that it was the Governments fault that so many prisoners were confined in so small a space.
('8', 231, 3, 14, 560706) If the space was insufficient the Govern ment ought not to have sent so many prisoners [to this gaol].
('8', 231, 3, 15, 560809) Had the movement continued, the Government would have found it impossible to accommodate any more.
('8', 231, 4, 16, 560908) READING
('8', 231, 5, 17, 560916) I mentioned earlier that the Governor had allowed us a table.
('8', 231, 5, 18, 560978) 1 We were also given pens and an ink pot.
('8', 231, 5, 19, 561020) The gaol has a library which lends books to prisoners.
('8', 231, 5, 20, 561075) I borrowed some of Carlyles works and the Bible.
('8', 231, 5, 21, 561124) From a Chinese interpreter who used to visit the place I borrowed a copy of the Koran in English, Huxleys lectures, Carlyles biographies of Burns, Johnson and Scott, and Bacons essays on civil and moral counsel.
('8', 231, 5, 22, 561336) I also had some books of my own; these included an edition of the Gita with a commentary by Manilal Nabhubhai 2, some Tamil books, an Urdu book presented by Maulvi Saheb, the writings of Tolstoy, Ruskin and Socrates 3. Most of these books I either read [for the first time] or re read during my stay in gaol.
('8', 231, 5, 23, 561645) I used to study Tamil regularly.
('8', 231, 5, 24, 561678) In the morning I read the Gita and in the afternoon portions of the Koran.
('8', 231, 5, 25, 561753) In the evening I used to explain the Bible to Mr. Fortoen, a Chinese Christian.
('8', 231, 5, 26, 561833) As he wished to learn

('8', 232, 1, 2, 562295) English, I taught it to him through the Bible.
('8', 232, 1, 3, 562342) If I was going to serve my full term of two months in gaol, I had intended to complete the translation of one of Carlyles books and another 1 of Ruskin.
('8', 232, 1, 4, 562495) I believe these books would have kept me wholly occupied.
('8', 232, 1, 5, 562553) If I had been awarded an even longer term, not only would I not have found it irksome, but I could have added usefully to my knowledge.
('8', 232, 1, 6, 562689) I would have been quite contented.
('8', 232, 1, 7, 562724) I believe that anyone who enjoys reading good books can easily bear to be alone anywhere.
('8', 232, 1, 8, 562814) Among my fellow prisoners, Mr. C. M. Pillay, Mr. Naidoo and a few Chinese were in the habit of reading.
('8', 232, 1, 9, 562918) Both the Naidoos had started learning Gujarati.
('8', 232, 1, 10, 562966) During the last days a few books of Gujarati songs arrived, and many of us read these.
('8', 232, 1, 11, 563053) But I do not call this reading.
('8', 232, 3, 12, 563085) In gaol we cannot spend the whole day reading.
('8', 232, 3, 13, 563132) Even if it were possible, we know that it is harmful in the long run.
('8', 232, 3, 14, 563202) We therefore managed, with some difficulty, to obtain the Governors permission to learn the [P. T.] drill from the warder.
('8', 232, 3, 15, 563325) A very kind man, he was only too happy to drill us morning and evening.
('8', 232, 3, 16, 563397) It did us a lot of good too.
('8', 232, 3, 17, 563426) If we could have continued it sufficiently long, it would have done us all good.
('8', 232, 3, 18, 563507) But the warders work increased with the increase in the number of Indians, and the yard proved too small for the purpose.
('8', 232, 3, 19, 563629) The drill was, therefore, given up.
('8', 232, 3, 20, 563665) However, we had Nawab Khan with us, and a drill of sorts was continued under his direction.
('8', 232, 3, 21, 563757) We also obtained the Governors permission to work on the sewing machine.
('8', 232, 3, 22, 563830) We tried to learn sewing pockets on to prisoners [uniforms].
('8', 232, 3, 23, 563891) Mr. T. Naidoo and Mr. Easton, as they had an aptitude for the work, learnt it very quickly.
('8', 232, 3, 24, 563983) It took me longer to pick it up.
('8', 232, 3, 25, 564016) Before I had learnt it properly, there was a sudden increase in the number of prisoners and I had to leave off.
('8', 232, 3, 26, 564128) The reader can thus see that given the will anyone can transform [even] a desert into a paradise.
('8', 232, 3, 27, 564226) [Had our imprisonment continued,] we could have thus kept ourselves occupied with some work or the other, and no prisoner would have found his confinement irksome; on the contrary, he would have come out a better informed and abler man.
('8', 232, 3, 28, 564463) There have been instances of conscie ntious men who achieved great things while in gaol.
('8', 232, 3, 29, 564552) John Bunion bore up with prison life and wrote The Pilgrims Progress, which proved an immortal work.
('8', 232, 3, 30, 564653) The British rank it next to the Bible.
('8', 232, 3, 31, 564692) Mr. Till wrote his Orison during his nine month imprisonment in Bombay.
('8', 232, 3, 32, 564764) Whether weare happy or miserable, whether we become good or bad in gaol or

('8', 233, 1, 2, 564897) elsewhere depends entirely on our own mental attitudes.
('8', 233, 2, 3, 564953) VISITORS
('8', 233, 3, 4, 564962) Some Englishmen came to visit us in gaol.
('8', 233, 3, 5, 565004) As a general rule, no prisoner is allowed visitors during the first month.
('8', 233, 3, 6, 565079) Thereafter, each prisoner is allowed a visitor once a month, who must come on a Sunday 1. The rule is relaxable in special circumstances.
('8', 233, 3, 7, 565217) Mr. Phillips took advantage of this provision.
('8', 233, 3, 8, 565264) The day after our arrival, he sought, and was granted, permission to visit Mr. Fortune, the Chinese Chris tian.
('8', 233, 3, 9, 565376) He also met the rest of us.
('8', 233, 3, 10, 565404) He spoke a word of cheer to each of us, and then prayed, as was his wont.
('8', 233, 3, 11, 565478) He managed to see us thrice.
('8', 233, 3, 12, 565507) Another clergyman, Rev.
('8', 233, 3, 13, 565531) Advise, also took advantage of the same pro vision to visit us.
('8', 233, 3, 14, 565595) By special I permission Mr. Polak and Mr. Coven 2, too, came to see us once.
('8', 233, 3, 15, 565672) He 3 was permitted to come only about [my] office work.
('8', 233, 3, 16, 565728) Thewarder is always present during a visit and all conversation must take place in his presence.
('8', 233, 3, 17, 565825) Mr. Cartwright, the editor of The Transvaal Leader, came thrice by special permission each time.
('8', 233, 3, 18, 565922) He came only with the object of bringing about a settlement.
('8', 233, 3, 19, 565983) He was therefore permitted to see us in private [that is, without the warder being present].
('8', 233, 3, 20, 566076) At his first meeting he formed an impression of what the Indian community would accept.
('8', 233, 3, 21, 566164) On the next occasion he brought with him the draft which he and other prominent Englishmen had prepared.
('8', 233, 3, 22, 566269) After some alterations, it was signed by Mr. Quinn, Mr. Nadir and myself.
('8', 233, 3, 23, 566343) This letter and the compromise having been dealt with at length elsewhere, 4 no more need be said about them here.
('8', 233, 3, 24, 566458) The Chief Magistrate, Mr. Playford, also visited us once.
('8', 233, 3, 25, 566516) He was entitled to come at will.
('8', 233, 3, 26, 566549) And it was not especially to see us that he came.
('8', 233, 3, 27, 566599) But it is believed that he found time to come because we were all in gaol.
('8', 233, 4, 28, 566674) RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION
('8', 233, 5, 29, 566696) It is now the practice in all western countries to provide religious instruction for prisoners.
('8', 233, 5, 30, 566792) Accordingly, the Johannesburg Gaol has a chapel for Christians.
('8', 233, 5, 31, 566856) But only white prisoners are allowed to worship
('8', 233, 6, 32, 566904) 1 It is not clear from the Gujarati whether a prisoner was allowed only one visi tor a month or whether it was the visitor who might not meet more than one prisoner during a visit.
('8', 233, 6, 33, 567085) 2 Ritchs father in law 3 Polak 4 Vide Johannesburg Letter, 8 2 1908
('8', 234, 0, 1, 567153) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 235
('8', 234, 1, 2, 567198) I asked for special permission for myself and Mr. Fortoen, but I was told by the Governor that the church was open only to white Christians.
('8', 234, 1, 3, 567339) They go to church every Sunday.
('8', 234, 1, 4, 567371) They listen to sermons from clergymen of different denominations by turns.
('8', 234, 1, 5, 567446) Some clergy men obtain special permission to preach to the Kaffirs too.
('8', 234, 1, 6, 567518) They have, however, no chapel of their own.
('8', 234, 1, 7, 567562) They therefore sit in the gaol com pound.
('8', 234, 1, 8, 567604) The Jews have a rabbi to visit them.
('8', 234, 1, 9, 567641) But there is no corresponding arrangement for Hindus or Muslims.
('8', 234, 1, 10, 567706) But then, there are not many Indian prisoners.
('8', 234, 1, 11, 567753) All the same, it is rather humiliating that the religious needs of the Indian com munity should be ignored in gaol.
('8', 234, 1, 12, 567869) Leaders of the two communities should give thought to this matter and arrange for instruction in both religions even if there should be only one Indian [in gaol].
('8', 234, 1, 13, 568032) The Mau lvis and Hindu priests chosen for this work should be sincere men, otherwise their instruction is likely to be something of an infliction.
('8', 234, 2, 14, 568179) CONCLUSION
('8', 234, 3, 15, 568190) Much of what is worth knowing [about gaol life] has been dis cussed.
('8', 234, 3, 16, 568259) It is necessary to give further thought to the fact of Indians being classed with Kaffirs in gaol.
('8', 234, 3, 17, 568358) White prisoners are given a small bed each, a tooth brush and, in addition to a towel, a handkerchief.
('8', 234, 3, 18, 568461) We must ask to know why Indian prisoners also may not have these things.
('8', 234, 3, 19, 568534) One should not feel that these things are not worth bothering about.
('8', 234, 3, 20, 568603) As the saying goes, drop by drop the lake fills.
('8', 234, 3, 21, 568652) Similarly little things enhance or lower our prestige in the eyes of others.
('8', 234, 3, 22, 568729) We read in the book Arab Wisdom that he who enjoys no respect has no religion.
('8', 234, 4, 23, 568808) It is by defending their honour over a long period of time that nations achieve greatness.
('8', 234, 4, 24, 568899) Honour does not mean arrogance; real honour consists in a state of mind that does not countenance the loss of a right, and in action flowing from such a state of mind.
('8', 234, 4, 25, 569067) He alone can attain to such honour who really trustsdepends onGod.
('8', 234, 4, 26, 569134) I am convinced that it is impossible for a man without sincere faith to discern the truth in every situation and act on it.

('8', 235, 2, 3, 569402) CHINESE MEETING
('8', 235, 3, 4, 569418) The Chinese have done something remarkable.
('8', 235, 3, 5, 569462) They have surpassed us in unity, cleanliness, culture and generosity.
('8', 235, 3, 6, 569532) On Friday, the 20th, they sent out two sorts of invitations.
('8', 235, 3, 7, 569593) One was to a function where addresses were to be presented to those who had helped their cause.
('8', 235, 3, 8, 569689) The other was to a dinner.
('8', 235, 3, 9, 569716) The [first] function was scheduled for three oclock.
('8', 235, 3, 10, 569769) It was in their own hall.
('8', 235, 3, 11, 569795) Invitations were sent to Englishmen and a few Indians.
('8', 235, 3, 12, 569850) Their hall is incomparably superior to ours.
('8', 235, 3, 13, 569895) It was elegantly decorated.
('8', 235, 3, 14, 569923) At the function a noble tribute was paid to Mr. Phillips in an address which carried beautiful drawings.
('8', 235, 3, 15, 570028) It thanked him for his exertions.
('8', 235, 3, 16, 570062) Another address was presented to Mr. Doke.
('8', 235, 3, 17, 570105) He was thanked for his work and for looking after Mr. Gandhi.
('8', 235, 3, 18, 570167) Mrs. Doke was presented with a beautiful oaken desk, also for looking after Mr. Gandhi.
('8', 235, 3, 19, 570255) Mr. Cartwright was given a gold watch costing 27. Mr. David Pollock was given a purse of 20 Mr. Polak was presented with an address in which he was thanked for the excellent work he had done for the commu nity.
('8', 235, 3, 20, 570466) It said: We cannot measure your work in terms of money.
('8', 235, 3, 21, 570522) Though you consider the satisfaction your derive to be sufficient reward, we hope you will accept what we think is our duty to offer you and to Mrs. Polak.
('8', 235, 3, 22, 570678) Mrs. Polak was given a gold necklace and a cutlery set costing about 28, and Mr. Polak was given a purse of 50. The address sent to Mr. Ritch in England was read out at the meeting.
('8', 235, 3, 23, 570860) It said: But for your unremitting efforts, this excellent settlement would have been impossible.
('8', 235, 3, 24, 570957) There is admiration all round for what you have done.
('8', 235, 3, 25, 571011) It was entirely due to your efforts that a strong fight was put up in England.
('8', 235, 3, 26, 571090) We shall never forget your good work.
('8', 235, 3, 27, 571128) Along with this they sent Mr. Ritch a purse of 60. To Miss Schlesin, a gold watch costing l was given as a gift.
('8', 235, 3, 28, 571241) Mr. Gandhi was presented with an address which said: It was thanks to your political acumen that this excellent settle ment was effected.
('8', 235, 3, 29, 571379) You were the only one who could have achie ved this, and we are very grateful to you for what you have done.
('8', 235, 3, 30, 571488) But for you, we would have lost.
('8', 235, 3, 31, 571521) But we revere you espe cially for your good qualities of character, which, we believe, en

('8', 236, 1, 2, 571657) nobled our campaign, with the result that Asiatic communities are treated today with respect.
('8', 236, 1, 3, 571751) You combine courage with court esy and humility, on account of which all of us bear you love and want to seek your guidance.
('8', 236, 1, 4, 571876) Mr. Hosken was present at the banquet.
('8', 236, 1, 5, 571915) He made an excellent speech.
('8', 236, 1, 6, 571944) At the dinner table covers were laid for 92 persons.
('8', 236, 1, 7, 571997) Thirty of them were guests and the remaining 62 Chinese.
('8', 236, 1, 8, 572054) There was a band in attendance.
('8', 236, 1, 9, 572086) There were three Chinese ladies at the dinner and the Chinese Consul was present.
('8', 236, 1, 10, 572168) Dinner over, Mr. Quinn proposed a toast to the [Chinese] Emperor and said in the course of a speech: We are able to live in freedom in the British Empire, and there fore wish it prosperity.
('8', 236, 1, 11, 572358) We are Chinese subjects, and it is accor dingly our duty to wish prosperity to the Chinese Emperor.
('8', 236, 1, 12, 572458) The Secretary of the Chinese Association said in his speech: European gentlemen helped the Indian cause because Indians are British subjects.
('8', 236, 1, 13, 572600) They have no such bond with us, yet they helped us and this could only be ascribed to their sense of justice.
('8', 236, 1, 14, 572710) It is in appreciation of that that we give this dinner, although it is not very much.
('8', 236, 1, 15, 572796) Mr. Hosken then rose to reply.
('8', 236, 1, 16, 572827) He said: There is very little I have done.
('8', 236, 1, 17, 572870) I make no distinction between Coloured persons and whites.
('8', 236, 1, 18, 572929) The Asiatics have taught us a lesson.
('8', 236, 1, 19, 572967) I think both your courage and your success are worthy of the highest admiration.
('8', 236, 1, 20, 573048) Mr. Phillips said: Everything that has been said about the courage of the Asiatics is true.
('8', 236, 1, 21, 573140) I shall certainly continue to do all I can.
('8', 236, 1, 22, 573184) Mr. Doke spoke in the same strain.
('8', 236, 1, 23, 573219) He was followed by Mr. Cartwright and Mr. Polak.
('8', 236, 1, 24, 573268) Mr. Polak said: This struggle has been profitable to every Asiatic.
('8', 236, 1, 25, 573336) I think the credit for defeating the Boer Government should really go to the Asiatics.
('8', 236, 1, 26, 573423) Mr. Gandhi said: It would be a good thing for the Asiatics not to be flattered by these compliments.
('8', 236, 1, 27, 573524) There are Yet many tasks ahead.
('8', 236, 1, 28, 573556) If we fail in these, there will be a set back.
('8', 236, 1, 29, 573603) It is necessary we maintain the utmost courtesy, humility and truth.
('8', 236, 1, 30, 573672) We cannot do so unless we are pure in our hearts.
('8', 236, 1, 31, 573722) Mr. Essop Mia said in his speech: The Chinese have outdone the Indians.
('8', 236, 1, 32, 573794) In many respects they
('8', 237, 0, 1, 573816) 238 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 237, 1, 2, 573858) have excelled them.
('8', 237, 1, 3, 573878) It was a good thing that the Indians and the Chinese presented a united front during the campaign.
('8', 237, 1, 4, 573977) I was very near being disillusioned with British rule.
('8', 237, 1, 5, 574032) But I see now that justice is done under it, if those who want justice are diligent and have a genuine case.
('8', 237, 1, 6, 574141) The meeting dispersed at eleven after, God Save the King.
('8', 237, 2, 7, 574199) EDUCATION IN KRUGERSDORP
('8', 237, 3, 8, 574224) In Krugersdorp there is a school for Coloured children to which some Cape Coloureds go.
('8', 237, 3, 9, 574312) Indians do not either go to this school at all, or very few of them do.
('8', 237, 3, 10, 574384) In view of this, there is a danger of the Government closing it down.
('8', 237, 3, 11, 574454) Indian parents who have children of school going age should therefore send them there.
('8', 237, 3, 12, 574541) I advise Indian parents to avail themselves of the facilities provided by it, following the [Gujarati] maxim: It is better to have an uncle who squints than none at all. I am told that some Madrasi boys go to this school.
('8', 237, 4, 13, 574763) ABOUT LICENCES
('8', 237, 5, 14, 574778) I wrote about licences last time.
('8', 237, 5, 15, 574812) The Association has since received a telegram from the Receiver at Pretoria, saying that so far very few Indians have taken out licences and that if they do not do so immediately, those without licences will be Prosecuted.
('8', 237, 5, 16, 575035) Because of our success in the campaign, some Indians appear to think that nothing can happen to them now.
('8', 237, 5, 17, 575141) If there are really any persons who argue in this manner they make a great mistake and will do the community harm.
('8', 237, 5, 18, 575256) Whatever we are able to do now is in virtue of our good repu tation.
('8', 237, 5, 19, 575325) Once we lose that reputation, we shall lose all that we have won.
('8', 237, 5, 20, 575391) Those who wish well to the community ought to bear this in mind and to explain it to others.
('8', 237, 5, 21, 575484) Even about thumb impressions, the complaints continue.
('8', 237, 5, 22, 575539) Some people appear to think that they can be exempted from giving their finger impressions without their having to give any reasons.
('8', 237, 5, 23, 575672) This is an erroneous idea.
('8', 237, 5, 24, 575699) It should be remembered that one can be exempted from giving ones finger impressions only on the ground of education, status or religious [or conscientious] objection.
('8', 237, 5, 25, 575867) It is not enough, then, just to go to the Registrar and inform him that you do not wish to give your finger impressions.
('8', 237, 5, 26, 575988) I earnestly hope that Indians will remember these points about licences and finger impres sions.
('8', 237, 6, 27, 576085) ROODEPOORT INDIANS
('8', 237, 7, 28, 576104) At Roodepoort the whites are becoming envious of the Indians.
('8', 237, 7, 29, 576166) They have discovered that there are some Indians in the town who buy land in the names of whites and themselves enjoy the rights of own 
('8', 238, 0, 1, 576303) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 239
('8', 238, 1, 2, 576348) ership.
('8', 238, 1, 3, 576356) They have complained to the Colonial Secretary and have sug gested that the law should be so amended as to make it impossible for whites to hold land for Indians and for Indians to accept any land bonds from the whites.
('8', 238, 1, 4, 576576) Indians should take note of this warning and realize that the whites have not yet sheathed their swords.
('8', 238, 1, 5, 576681) If meanwhile the Indians, out of overweening pride at their success or for any other reason, forfeit the good name that they have earned for themselves, they will regret it later.
('8', 238, 2, 6, 576861) BAILEYS SPEECH
('8', 238, 3, 7, 576876) Mr. Abe Bailey is a leading member of the Transvaal Parlia ment.
('8', 238, 3, 8, 576941) He is a leading member of the Progressive Party and a mine owner.: Last Saturday in Krugersdorp he made a speech in which he referred too the obnoxious law 1 (We print this speech elsewhere).
('8', 238, 3, 9, 577133) There are two points to be noted in Mr. Baileys speech.
('8', 238, 3, 10, 577189) First, wha tever the Indians may believe, the whites at least know that the Govern ment has lost and has had to climb down.
('8', 238, 3, 11, 577313) And secondly, it may still be necessary for us to: put up a fight against the whites.
('8', 238, 3, 12, 577399) The Indian com munity therefore must ever remain vigilant.
('8', 238, 3, 13, 577458) If we are caught napping, we shall be ruined.
('8', 238, 3, 14, 577504) Truth and unity, our two weapons, must ever lie ready to hand.
('8', 238, 3, 15, 577567) FEDERATION HALL
('8', 238, 4, 16, 577583) Mr. Essop Mia has received the following letter: Sir, We have read the appeal published in Gujarati under your signature in the issue of the 14th in connection with the Federation Hall Fund.
('8', 238, 4, 17, 577774) Your words All those who have Indian blood in their veins will sincerely promote this cause are so true and have stirred us.
('8', 238, 4, 18, 577899) Be kind enough to accept these small amounts: Manaji Nathubhai Ghelani, 1; Vithaldas Manaji, 10s; and Mohanlal Manaji, 10s; total 2.
('8', 238, 5, 19, 578032) [From Gujarati] Indian Opinion, 28 3 1908
('8', 238, 6, 20, 578074) 1 Abe Bailey spoke sneeringly of the climb down by General Smuts on the subject of the Asiatic Registration Act under pressure from the Imperial Government.
('8', 238, 6, 21, 578231) He noted with pleasure the continued awareness of the Asiatic issue among the Krugersdorp whites and the anti Asiatic campaign of the White Hawkers League.
('8', 238, 6, 22, 578387) He also appealed to all the whites in the town, particularly the women, for their support presumably in the boycott of Indian hawkersin order to ensure success.

('8', 239, 2, 3, 578622) THE LATE MUSTAFA KAMAL PASHA
('8', 239, 3, 4, 578651) Mustafa Kamal Pasha, the famous leader, died in February last in Cairo at the early age of 33. We publish below his life sketch culled from Egyptian newspapers.
('8', 239, 3, 5, 578812) He was born in 1874. His education started at the age of six.
('8', 239, 3, 6, 578874) After a few years study [at home], he joined a school in Cairo, established in the memory of the well known Abbas Pasha.
('8', 239, 3, 7, 578995) His father, Ali Effendi Mahomed, who was Chief Engineer to the Government, died about this time.
('8', 239, 3, 8, 579092) Mustafa Kamal Pasha passed the primary school examination at the age of ten, standing first.
('8', 239, 3, 9, 579185) Four years later, he passed the secondary school examination, distinguishing himself as a gifted and intelligent student.
('8', 239, 3, 10, 579307) At the age of 15, he started studying law and French.
('8', 239, 3, 11, 579361) The seeds of his political career were sown about this time.
('8', 239, 3, 12, 579422) Soon after, he went to France for further studies, and obtained a degree in law at the age of 19. On the strength of his knowledge of law, he bravely plunged into politics, young as he was, and started a great movement, doing his utmost for it by way of speech and writing till his death.
('8', 239, 3, 13, 579711) He was associated with several public bodies in Cairo, and by his speeches inspired their members to political activity.
('8', 239, 3, 14, 579832) The letter which he addressed to the French Chamber at Toulouse in France was the first notable step in his political career.
('8', 239, 3, 15, 579958) In that letter he described Egypts problems and difficulties.
('8', 239, 3, 16, 580020) This courageous and far sighted act gave him his first opportunity for a political speech in public.
('8', 239, 3, 17, 580121) He was then invited to address prominent leaders in Toulouse.
('8', 239, 3, 18, 580183) Only those who have heard Mustafa Kamal Pasha can have an idea of the powerful impression he could make on the audience by his command of language.
('8', 239, 3, 19, 580331) People were delighted to hear him talk, both in private and in public, especially on the conditions in his country.
('8', 239, 3, 20, 580447) His orations, imbued as they were with patriotic fervour, could rouse people almost to a frenzy and endeared him to them.
('8', 239, 3, 21, 580569) His political philosophy was highly nationalistic like that of the extremists in India.
('8', 239, 3, 22, 580657) People from all classes ofsociety, from prince to pauper, thronged to hear him speak; and Mustafa Kamal Pasha preached brotherhood to them all.
('8', 239, 3, 23, 580801) He made a number of speeches to the people of Cairo and Alexandria between 1895 and 1907. These speeches were prepared with great thought and skill and always went down very well.
('8', 239, 3, 24, 580981) People looked upon Mustafa Kamal Pasha as their guardian and saviour.
('8', 239, 3, 25, 581051) There are many touching stories of their love for him.
('8', 240, 0, 1, 581106) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 241
('8', 240, 1, 2, 581151) ever any section of society had a grievance against the [British] Gov ernment, they would besiege the offices of Luwa (Mustafa Kamal Pashas paper) and clamour for his intervention or guidance.
('8', 240, 1, 3, 581344) The Pasha would tell them what to do and advise them to act with firmness and courage and to adhere unflinchingly to truth and duty.
('8', 240, 1, 4, 581477) He beca me well known for these virtues of his.
('8', 240, 1, 5, 581525) The Pasha used proudly to narrate an instance of how much the people loved him.
('8', 240, 1, 6, 581605) Once, he hired an arbagi to carry him to the hall where he was to speak, and detained the driver there for more than an hour.
('8', 240, 1, 7, 581731) When, on his return, he offered the driver his fare, the latter emphatically refused it, saying that he was happy and proud to have been of service to the nations leader.
('8', 240, 1, 8, 581902) There are many other instances which show the hold he had over the hearts of the people.
('8', 240, 1, 9, 581991) His words inspired them to fanatical zeal in facing their tasks and serving the cause of Egypts progress.

('8', 240, 4, 13, 582236) DEAR SIR, Re.
('8', 240, 4, 14, 582250) Budrea and Others I have gone through all the papers in this matter.
('8', 240, 4, 15, 582319) If the averm ents in the plea, in paragraphs 6 and 7, are true, that is to say, if the land sought to be transferred to Vawda is not the land contemplated by the contract, the case is easily ours; but it seems to me to be too good to be true, because it would be almost fraudulent for Vawda.
('8', 240, 4, 16, 582611) I therefore hope that you have made yourself absolutely certain of the facts and not merely relied upon whatGoordeen might have had to say, because, in his enthusiasm, he might have made some mis state ments.
('8', 240, 5, 17, 582820) Yours faithfully,

('8', 241, 2, 3, 583004) [JOHANNESBURG,] March 28, 1908
('8', 241, 3, 4, 583035) MY DEAR MAGANLAL, Please tell Mr. Budrea I have gone through his papers most carefully.
('8', 241, 3, 5, 583123) I have read the agreement that was signed by Mr. Anderson from Newcastle.
('8', 241, 3, 6, 583197) I have read the reply to Vawdas summons.
('8', 241, 3, 7, 583238) There are two things which certainly should give Mr. Budrea complete success.
('8', 241, 3, 8, 583316) Paragraphs 6 and 7 of the reply state that the land wanted by Vawda is not the land described in the contract, and that the land surveyed by the surveyor includes land which is not covered by the contract, according to which the summons is issued.
('8', 241, 3, 9, 583564) If these two things can be proved, Mr. Budrea must win, but I am very much afraid that there may be some mistake in the reply given.
('8', 241, 3, 10, 583697) He must, therefore, be very careful, because, if he loses, the action in the Supreme Court will costhim probably 100 or more.
('8', 241, 3, 11, 583823) The Solicitor at Dundee, Mr. Labistour, has sent me the papers.
('8', 241, 3, 12, 583887) He is very hopeful, but I should myself like to be absolutely certain that the land required by Vawda is not the land described in the contract.
('8', 241, 3, 13, 584032) You must therefore have every emphatic and conclusive evidence regarding it.
('8', 241, 3, 14, 584109) You should explain this letter to Mr. Budrea thoroughly.
('8', 241, 3, 15, 584166) If he wants to put more questions, I am in a position now to answer them, because I have all the papers, I think, before me and, what is more, I have studied them.
('8', 241, 3, 16, 584330) Please also tell Mr. Budrea that after the last account that was rendered to him and about which he said something, I have not charged any fees at all, and I am not charging any fees without his concurrence with reference to the work I am now doing.
('8', 241, 3, 17, 584580) Please ask him what his own opinion is in the matter, and whether I should charge a fee.
('8', 241, 3, 18, 584669) Tell him, that although it is not the usual thing, I wish to be guided entirely by him in the matter of fees, as he has reposed so complete [a] trust in me.
('8', 241, 3, 19, 584826) You may leave this letter at Mr. Jitanmias, if you do not find Mr. Budrea.
('8', 241, 4, 20, 584901) Yours sincerely,

('8', 242, 1, 2, 585007) 118. LORD SELBORNES VIEW
('8', 242, 2, 3, 585032) Lord Selbornes speech at Klerksdorp on the Indian question deserves to be pondered by every Indian.
('8', 242, 2, 4, 585132) We print a translation of it elsewhere.
('8', 242, 2, 5, 585172) The burden of Lord Selbornes speech is that Indians and other Asiatic races should be kept out from areas reserved for whites.
('8', 242, 2, 6, 585299) They may settle in districts to be specially set apart for them.
('8', 242, 2, 7, 585364) As to how they can be prevented from settling in areas reserved for whites, he suggests that, since Indians are British subjects and a cowardly [people], they can be treated as one pleases.
('8', 242, 2, 8, 585554) But there remain the Japanese and the Chinese.
('8', 242, 2, 9, 585601) The British Navy ought to be strengthened to keep these out.
('8', 242, 2, 10, 585662) Among countries to be reserved for the whites, Lord Selborne mentions South Africa, Australia, America, New Zealand, etc.
('8', 242, 2, 11, 585784) He concedes that the Indians should be allowed facilities for colonization, and suggestion gests that Colonies in East Africa may be set apart for them.
('8', 242, 2, 12, 585937) 1 them.
('8', 242, 2, 13, 585945) On reflection we see that this would mean perpetual slavery for Indians, for, if Indians settle in regions such as East Africa, even there the whites will have the upper hand.
('8', 242, 2, 14, 586121) The whites will have found a new training ground or stepping stone.
('8', 242, 2, 15, 586189) Moreover, Indians are in capable of settling by themselves in a country and developing it along modern lines.
('8', 242, 2, 16, 586299) The suggestion therefore that certain areas be earmarked for Indians is without point altogether.
('8', 242, 2, 17, 586397) Lord Selbornes speech also implies that no regions where the climate is congenial to white settlers should be reserved for Indians.
('8', 242, 2, 18, 586529) In other words, Indians should only be allotted swampy and malarial regions.
('8', 242, 2, 19, 586606) Lord Selborne will not mind Indians languishing in these areas.
('8', 242, 2, 20, 586670) We regard Lord Selbornes speech as utterly selfish and dangerous.
('8', 242, 2, 21, 586736) If he had his way, not a single Indian would be left in South Africa.
('8', 242, 2, 22, 586806) He believes that East and West can never meet.
('8', 242, 2, 23, 586853) If this view is correct, India can have a place in the British Empire only as a subject country.
('8', 242, 2, 24, 586950) No other way is open to her.
('8', 242, 2, 25, 586979) We do not subscribe to this view.
('8', 242, 2, 26, 587013) If it is proved that the British people share this view and that there can be no alternative to it, we shall be compelled to raise our banner against British rule.
('8', 242, 2, 27, 587177) It will then be necessary to adopt, and to help others adopt, the means to free India totally from British rule.
('8', 242, 2, 28, 587290) But we believe that we can still enjoy freedom by continuing to live under the British flag.
('8', 242, 2, 29, 587383) The Boers live under the British flag, and are none the less free for that.
('8', 242, 3, 30, 587459) 1 Lionel Curtis made a similar suggestion in 1906; vide Interview to The Natal Mercury, 7 5 1907
('8', 243, 0, 1, 587556) 244 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 243, 1, 2, 587598) We should therefore consider what measures to be adopted to counter [the influence of] Lord Selbornes ideas.
('8', 243, 1, 3, 587707) The remedy, we believe, lies in our own hands.
('8', 243, 1, 4, 587754) We find that in this world we generally get what we demand and deserve.
('8', 243, 1, 5, 587826) If we really want to settle in diverse regions of the world and prosper, we shall find the necessary means.
('8', 243, 1, 6, 587934) Three measures appear imperative: (1) that every Indian should faithfully follow his religion; (2) that Hindus and Muslims should remain united; and (3) that Indians should acquire the right kind of education.
('8', 243, 1, 7, 588144) If the first condition is realized, the remaining two will be fulfilled as a matter of course.
('8', 243, 1, 8, 588239) We believe all the great religions of the world to be true.
('8', 243, 1, 9, 588299) If, therefore, every community follows its religion diligently, it will come to have faith in and consequently to cherish nothing but truth.
('8', 243, 1, 10, 588440) If we practise our own religion in its proper spirit, we shall not squabble among ourselves, but remain united.
('8', 243, 1, 11, 588552) Further more, those who would follow the path of religion sincerely cannot choose to remain uneducated and ignorant.
('8', 243, 1, 12, 588669) They will find it impos sible to remain idle and, if there is no idleness, everyone, whether child or adult, will be busy learning.
('8', 243, 1, 13, 588801) We invite the attention of every Indian to these thoughts.
('8', 243, 1, 14, 588860) We are living through times which enjoin us to be alert and wide awake.

('8', 243, 3, 17, 588992) An attack on the Natal Indians is imminent.
('8', 243, 3, 18, 589036) There are some who want that no trading licences should be given them, and others who would that every Indian was expelled from Natal.
('8', 243, 3, 19, 589171) The Colonial Secretary, Dr. Gubbins, has now granted an interview to The [Natal] Mercury.
('8', 243, 3, 20, 589261) Apparently, the Government intends to introduce legislation to control the immigration of indentured Indian tabour and withhold issue of trading licences to Indians.
('8', 243, 3, 21, 589427) They intend to prohibit the immigration of indentured tabour after a fixed date.
('8', 243, 3, 22, 589508) With that end in view, the Agency at Calcutta has been closed.
('8', 243, 3, 23, 589571) The issue of trading licences is to be stopped after ten years, and if any Indian traders still remain, it is proposed to force them to close down their businesses and compensate them for the loss.
('8', 243, 3, 24, 589769) The proposal to stop immigration of indentured labour deserves our support.
('8', 243, 3, 25, 589845) So long as such immigration continues, the Indian community will have no peace.
('8', 243, 3, 26, 589925) We cannot say much about the Bill in regard to trading licences
('8', 244, 0, 1, 589989) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 245
('8', 244, 1, 2, 590034) till it is published.
('8', 244, 1, 3, 590056) But there will be no scope for comment if they pass a law allowing for a time limit of ten years and providing for payment of compensation thereafter.
('8', 244, 1, 4, 590207) Indians, however, must not think of acce pting compensation and running away.
('8', 244, 1, 5, 590285) Those Indians who have set tled in Natal must learn to look upon the Colony as their second home and settle there.
('8', 244, 1, 6, 590400) If anyone wants to drive them out of Natal, they must not oblige.
('8', 244, 1, 7, 590466) Indians must learn to feel that Natal is as much their coun try as it is of the whites, and be proud of working for its prosperity.
('8', 244, 1, 8, 590598) We should not therefore approve of the proposal to fix a time limit of ten years.
('8', 244, 1, 9, 590680) On the other hand, it may not be possible for us to prevent such legislation.
('8', 244, 1, 10, 590758) But during the period of ten years we can so enhance our power and status that the whites themselves will think in terms of retaining us rather than driving us out.
('8', 244, 1, 11, 590923) It is within the power of Indians to bring this about.

('8', 244, 2, 13, 591019) 120. HASSAN MIAS DEPARTURE
('8', 244, 3, 14, 591046) Mr. Hassan Mia, Mr. Dawad Mahomeds son, whose going to England for further studies had been under discussion for some time past, left for that country last week.
('8', 244, 3, 15, 591208) This shows that people rejoice when they see something good being done and commend it.
('8', 244, 3, 16, 591295) Hassan Mia is young.
('8', 244, 3, 17, 591316) He has yet to see and learn a great deal.
('8', 244, 3, 18, 591358) We wish him long life, health and prosperity.
('8', 244, 3, 19, 591404) He is the first Natal Indian of his social position to go to England.
('8', 244, 3, 20, 591474) We congratulate Mr. Dawad Maho med on his courage.
('8', 244, 3, 21, 591525) The Indian community has a moral to learn from this case.
('8', 244, 3, 22, 591583) Without the right kind of education, the community will not only remain backward, but become increasingly so.
('8', 244, 3, 23, 591693) Education in England, the study of English, world history and of the sciences all these are essential in the world of today.
('8', 244, 3, 24, 591818) Without them one is crippled.
('8', 244, 3, 25, 591848) It is also necessary to learn how to put the knowledge thus acquired to proper use.
('8', 244, 3, 26, 591932) In itself knowledge is only a means.
('8', 244, 3, 27, 591969) It can be employed for good, for making money, and in the service of public causes.
('8', 244, 3, 28, 592053) Knowledge is justified only when it is put to good use and employed in the public cause.
('8', 244, 3, 29, 592142) Otherwise, as we pointed out once earlier and as everyone will readily admit, it is like poison.
('8', 244, 3, 30, 592239) We hope that Mr. Hassan Mias 1 spirit of adventure will be

('8', 245, 3, 5, 592481) We have published several comments on the settlement.
('8', 245, 3, 6, 592535) In an earlier issue we published a great deal in favour of it.
('8', 245, 3, 7, 592598) In the current issue we publish as much as we can from the unfavourable comments which we have received.
('8', 245, 3, 8, 592703) We think it is time we gave up arguing about the settlement.
('8', 245, 3, 9, 592764) The community must turn to other tasks and enter prises.
('8', 245, 3, 10, 592821) It is not yet in a position to sit back.
('8', 245, 3, 11, 592862) Those who are anxious always to march forward do not think of sitting back.
('8', 245, 3, 12, 592938) Now on we shall not publish comments on the settlement from local correspondents, whether for or against.
('8', 245, 3, 13, 593044) We shall only publish communications from India or England for [our] future guidance.
('8', 245, 3, 14, 593130) Many of the corres pondents whose views we publish in this issue appear to us to be palpably wrong.
('8', 245, 3, 15, 593230) But so much has already been said on this subject by us and by others that we see no need of writing further or correcting any misconceptions.
('8', 245, 3, 16, 593373) In every movement there is bound to occur and remain a certain amount of misunderstanding.
('8', 245, 3, 17, 593464) It is not always pos sible to clear this up.
('8', 245, 3, 18, 593509) Time finds answers for all.
('8', 245, 3, 19, 593537) We therefore appeal to our readers to forget all about the controversy regarding the settle ment.
('8', 245, 3, 20, 593635) It will be enough if they bear in mind that the glory of satya graha, which we have witnessed, cannot be dimmed.

('8', 245, 5, 23, 593827) PREFACE
('8', 245, 6, 24, 593835) The heroic Socrates, an extraordinary person with a fine moral character, was born in 471 B.C. A Greek, he lived a virtuous and benevolent life.
('8', 245, 6, 25, 593980) Unable to bear his moral excellence and his virtue, some envious person made false accusations against him.
('8', 245, 6, 26, 594088) Socrates lived in fear of God 1 and cared little for the obloquy of men.
('8', 245, 6, 27, 594161) He had no fear of death.
('8', 245, 6, 28, 594186) A reformer, he strove to cleanse Athens, the capital

('8', 245, 7, 31, 594452) Elsewhere he refers to God as Khuda Ishwar.

('8', 246, 1, 3, 594666) He made a powerful impression on the minds of the young who followed him about in crowds.
('8', 246, 1, 4, 594756) [Socrates teaching] had theresult of Putting an end to the unconscionable gains made by persons [with predatory tenden cies].
('8', 246, 1, 5, 594882) It came in the way of those who lived by exploiting others.
('8', 246, 1, 6, 594942) In Athens it was an offence to disregard the traditional religion of the polis or encourage others to do so.
('8', 246, 1, 7, 595051) The offence, if proved, was punishable with death.
('8', 246, 1, 8, 595102) Socrates adhered to the traditional religion, but called upon the people to fight the corrut elements [associated with its observance].
('8', 246, 1, 9, 595238) He himself would have nothing to do with them.
('8', 246, 1, 10, 595285) Under the law of Athens, such offences were tried before a popular assembly.
('8', 246, 1, 11, 595362) Socrates was charged with violating the religion of the state and teaching others to do likewise and was tried before an assembly of elders.
('8', 246, 1, 12, 595503) Many members of the assembly had suffered as a result of Socrates teaching.
('8', 246, 1, 13, 595579) Because of this, they bore him a grudge.
('8', 246, 1, 14, 595620) They wrongfully declared him guilty and condemned him to die by taking poison.
('8', 246, 1, 15, 595699) A prisoner sentenced might be put to death in any one of a number of ways.
('8', 246, 1, 16, 595774) Socrates was condemned to death by poisoning.
('8', 246, 1, 17, 595820) This brave man took poison by his own hand and died.
('8', 246, 1, 18, 595873) On the day of his death he discoursed to his friend and companion on the perishable nature of the human body and the immortality of the soul.
('8', 246, 1, 19, 596015) It is said that up to the very last moment Socrates showed no fear, and that he took the poison smilingly.
('8', 246, 1, 20, 596122) As he finished the last sentence of his discourse, he drank the poison from the cup as eagerly as we might drink sherbet from a glass.
('8', 246, 1, 21, 596257) Today the world cherishes Socrates memory.
('8', 246, 1, 22, 596300) His teaching has benefited millions.
('8', 246, 1, 23, 596337) His accusers and his judges stand condemned by the world.
('8', 246, 1, 24, 596395) Socrates has gained immortality and Greece stands in high esteem because of him and others like him.
('8', 246, 1, 25, 596496) Socrates speech in his own defence was committed to writing by his companion, the celebrated Plato.
('8', 246, 1, 26, 596596) It has been translated into many languages.
('8', 246, 1, 27, 596640) The defence is excellent and imbued with moral fervour.
('8', 246, 1, 28, 596696) We, therefore, wish to translate it, but rather than render it literally, we print only a summary of it.
('8', 246, 1, 29, 596801) We have much to struggle for, not only in South Africa but in India as well.
('8', 246, 1, 30, 596878) Only when we succeed in these [tasks] can India be rid of its many afflictions.
('8', 246, 1, 31, 596958) We must learn to live and die like Socrates.
('8', 246, 1, 32, 597003) He was, moreover, a great Satyagrahai.
('8', 246, 1, 33, 597042) He adopted Satyagraha against his own people.
('8', 246, 1, 34, 597088) As a result the Greeks became a great people.
('8', 246, 1, 35, 597134) if, through cowardice or fear of dishonour or death, we fail to realize or examine our shortcomings and fail to draw the peoples attention to them, we
('8', 247, 0, 1, 597285) 248 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 247, 1, 2, 597327) shall do no good to Indias cause, notwithstanding the number of ex ternal remedies we may adopt, notwithstanding the Congress sessions [we may hold], not even by becoming extremists.
('8', 247, 1, 3, 597510) Indias good does not lie along that direction.
('8', 247, 1, 4, 597557) When the disease is diagnosed and its true nature revealed in public, and when, through suitable remedies, the body [politic] of India is cured and cleansed both within and without, it will become immune to the germs of the disease, that is, to the oppression by the British and the others.
('8', 247, 1, 5, 597848) If, however, the body itself is in a state of decay, then if we destroy one kind of germs, it will be attacked by another, and this will ruin the body [politic] India herself.
('8', 247, 1, 6, 598024) We argued thus and saw in the words of a great soul like Socrates the qualities of an elixir.
('8', 247, 1, 7, 598118) We wanted our readers, therefore, to imbibe a deep draught of it, so that they might be able to fightand to help others fight the disease.
('8', 247, 1, 8, 598257) It is with this objective in mind that we summarize Socratess speech.

('8', 247, 3, 11, 598400) The Pasha enjoyed extraordinary popularity among students.
('8', 247, 3, 12, 598459) It was once noted by a scholar that all students were his supporters.
('8', 247, 3, 13, 598529) When he returned from Europe, the students and the common people took out a long procession in his honour such as had never been seen before in honour of another Egyptian.
('8', 247, 3, 14, 598701) Besides being a great orator, Mustafa Kamal Pasha was a great writer.
('8', 247, 3, 15, 598771) According to the Daily News of England, he was one of the worlds ablest Muslim journalists.
('8', 247, 3, 16, 598863) While still in school, he wrote a book entitled Roman Slavery and another called The Life of Nations.
('8', 247, 3, 17, 598965) Besides some poetry, he wrote The Conquest of Andalusia, historical novel.
('8', 247, 3, 18, 599040) He possessed an unflagging imagination and an infinite capa city for taking pains.
('8', 247, 3, 19, 599123) While yet under twenty, he started Al Madresa, a magazine which became famous for its trenchant and original writing.
('8', 247, 3, 20, 599241) In 1900 he started the journal Luwa.
('8', 247, 3, 21, 599278) Earlier he had written for Egy ptian and foreign periodicals.
('8', 247, 3, 22, 599340) Thanks to his perfect mastery of Fren ch, he found invaluable opportunities for placing the Egyptian case before the European peoples.
('8', 247, 3, 23, 599475) Later in life, notwithstanding the pres sure of work, which had increased considerably, he found time to write a book on Japan.
('8', 247, 3, 24, 599603) Most of his European friends were Frenchmen, who are bound to be shocked to hear of the Pashas death.
('8', 247, 3, 25, 599705) His fine qualities of chara cter had won him a large number of friends.
('8', 247, 3, 26, 599777) People found his man

('8', 248, 1, 2, 599844) ners and his gentle speech irresistible, and joined his (Nationalist) Party.
('8', 248, 1, 3, 599921) Madame Juliet Adam, who was a lifelong friend, writes in the foreword to the French edition of his speeches that in the course of his extensive travels in Europe he had made many friends among sta tesmen and journalists.
('8', 248, 1, 4, 600142) These friendships stood him in good stead in his work for the countrys welfare.
('8', 248, 1, 5, 600222) Mustafa Kamal Pashas efforts were addressed to the task of stemming the tide of blind contempt for Egyptians, which had risen in the wake of British rule.
('8', 248, 1, 6, 600377) His success in this endeavour was unquestion able.
('8', 248, 1, 7, 600428) If today the French have a high opinion of the Egyptians in every field and are sympathetically inclined towards them, it is be cause of Mustafa Kamal Pashas great campaign.
('8', 248, 1, 8, 600602) His speeches, his conversation, his writings, all showed that he spared no effort to ensure the progress of his country.
('8', 248, 1, 9, 600723) His writings and speeches appear to be inspired by the principles of the great Italian patriot, Mazzini.
('8', 248, 1, 10, 600828) We often notice in them a conviction, similar to Mazzinis, that truth and justice will triumph in the end.
('8', 248, 1, 11, 600935) The evils of apathy, lack of patriotism and cowardice, he considered to be the arch enemies of his country and in his attempt to rid Egypt of them became involved in serious conflict.
('8', 248, 1, 12, 601119) He was convinced that Egypt could not make any real progress in the absence of intellectual resources like those that the West com manded.
('8', 248, 1, 13, 601258) He missed no opportunity of emphasizing the need for more intimate contacts between the peoples of the West and the East.
('8', 248, 1, 14, 601380) He remained, however, a faithful follower of Islam.
('8', 248, 1, 15, 601432) He had unbounded enthusiasm for religious reform.
('8', 248, 1, 16, 601482) His connection with Turkey was well known.
('8', 248, 1, 17, 601525) Piqued by it, some whites called him a Turkophile.
('8', 248, 1, 18, 601576) It was one of his political convictions that Turkey would not stand in the way of Egypts independence.
('8', 248, 1, 19, 601679) His political views won him the Sultans res pect and he was awarded the titles of Majidia of the Second Order and Ratba ul Saftani.
('8', 248, 1, 20, 601811) His activities during the closing years of his life were widely known throughout Egypt.
('8', 248, 1, 21, 601899) Each year he undertook more and more work.
('8', 248, 1, 22, 601942) He was a fearless man and would not give up his campaign.
('8', 248, 1, 23, 602000) The occupation of the Sudan by the British and other similar events dealt a cruel blow to [the hopes of] Egyptian independence.
('8', 248, 1, 24, 602128) But the Pasha remained undaunted.
('8', 248, 1, 25, 602162) As his supporters forsook him in increasing numbers and timid friends gave up their advocacy of [the cause of] Egypt, Mustafa Kamal Pasha became the bolder and exerted himself all the more.
('8', 248, 1, 26, 602352) His last great act was the founding of the Nationalist Party of

Thousands of people were moved to a high pitch of enthusiasm when he stepped out from his death bed to make a speech; they acclaimed it with thunderous applause, and the pledge that they took on the occasion to adhere to the principles of the Nationalist Party will be remembered as Mustafa Kamal Pashas legacy to his compatriots.
('8', 249, 1, 3, 602820) His delicate health was undermined by the severe strain of the work he did in connection with the founding of his party, so much so that he was never himself again.
('8', 249, 1, 4, 602985) He continued to work for the move ment from hisdeath bed, and wrote to the Prime Minister [of England] and to Sir Edward Grey in reply to the charge that Egyptians lacked ability and did not deserve an independent government.
('8', 249, 1, 5, 603211) On February 10, the sixth day after this, his earthly career came to an end, and he gave up his mortal body.

('8', 249, 3, 8, 603386) HAMIDIA SOCIETYS LETTER
('8', 249, 4, 9, 603410) The Hamidia [Islamic] Society has sent an address of thanks to several persons abroad who helped in the struggle against the law.
('8', 249, 4, 10, 603540) The address is printed in gold, red and yellow on thick card of superior quality with the edges trimmed decoratively.
('8', 249, 4, 11, 603658) About 200 copies will be posted.
('8', 249, 4, 12, 603691) It is signed by Imam Abdool Kadir.
('8', 249, 4, 13, 603726) Fancy and Mr. Coovadia.
('8', 249, 4, 14, 603750) Here is a translation of the address 1:
('8', 249, 5, 15, 603790) DEAR SIR,
('8', 249, 6, 16, 603800) On behalf of the Hamidia Islamic Society, we beg to tender you our best thanks for the very warm interest you have taken in the British Indian cause in the Transvaal, and for the prompt response you have always made to our Societys appeal for help.
('8', 249, 6, 17, 604049) We have no doubt that your advocacy contributed materially to the happy issue of the struggle which taxed the utmost resources of the community.
('8', 249, 6, 18, 604194) The Asiatic Act specially affected the Mahomedan commu nity in that it deliberately insulted Islam by distinguishing against Turkish Mahomedans and in favour of other Turkish subjects.
('8', 249, 6, 19, 604379) It was, therefore, natural that this Society should have made a special effort to secure the repeal of the Act, and it has been to our Society a matter of very great satisfaction that our appeal made to Mahomedans and others has been so favourably received.
('8', 249, 7, 20, 604637) 1 The English text is from Indian Opinion 18 4 1908.

('8', 250, 1, 2, 604735) THREE ADDRESSES
('8', 250, 2, 3, 604751) The addresses to Lord Ampthill, Syed Ameer Ali and Sir Muncherjee Bhownaggree are ready.
('8', 250, 2, 4, 604840) They will be posted to Mr. Ritch next week.
('8', 250, 2, 5, 604884) He will present them in person to the three gentlemen on behalf of the community.
('8', 250, 2, 6, 604966) The addresses express our thanks to them.
('8', 250, 2, 7, 605008) THE GOLD LAW The Government has published a draft Bill for a law about mines in the Transvaal.
('8', 250, 2, 8, 605103) The law is commonly known as The Gold Law.
('8', 250, 2, 9, 605146) The Government intends to get it passed during the next ses sion of Parliament.
('8', 250, 2, 10, 605226) The draft Bill has reference to the existing Gold Law but some of thesections bearing on Coloured persons, which were ambiguous, will now bear a construction unfavourable to them.
('8', 250, 2, 11, 605406) The Government had, under the present law, refused to issue licences in Johannesburg and other cities.
('8', 250, 2, 12, 605509) The readers of Indian Opinion may recall the case at Roodepoort.
('8', 250, 2, 13, 605574) Owing to the ambiguity the law] the Government did not persist in its stand.
('8', 250, 2, 14, 605651) If the draft Bill referred to above is passed, it will prevent Indians not only from obtaining licences in mining areas but also from residing in them.
('8', 250, 2, 15, 605803) That is to say, in the mining areas, Indians and other Coloured races can live only in the Location.
('8', 250, 2, 16, 605904) The noteworthy sections in the Bill.
('8', 250, 2, 17, 605941) I am sending a sum mary There are other noteworthy for the English section.
('8', 250, 2, 18, 606017) But the point most worthy of note is the one I have mentioned.
('8', 250, 2, 19, 606080) It will be necessary for the Indian community to put up a stiff fight against this law.
('8', 250, 2, 20, 606168) A journal in England has already come out in our favour.
('8', 250, 2, 21, 606225) But the opposition [to the law] will inspire respect only when we do all that is required of us.
('8', 250, 2, 22, 606322) The Indian community will continue to be the target of such attacks.
('8', 250, 2, 23, 606391) The more we fight back the more shall we succeed and the stronger shall we become.
('8', 250, 2, 24, 606474) PERFECT JUSTICE Some Kaffirs have bought land in their own names in Sophia town and settled there.
('8', 250, 2, 25, 606573) The sites are situated within municipal limits.
('8', 250, 2, 26, 606621) According to the municipal regulations, no Kaffir can live outside the Location without permission.
('8', 250, 2, 27, 606721) These Kaffirs were prosecuted by the municipality under the regulations.
('8', 250, 2, 28, 606794) The Magistrate fined them.
('8', 250, 2, 29, 606821) The Kaffirs went in appeal, and won.
('8', 250, 2, 30, 606858) The Supreme Court has held that it is ultra vires of the municipality to frame a regulation for Kaffirs.
('8', 250, 3, 31, 606963) 1 In fact, one of the judges remarked that, while the law might be on the side of the municipality, the equities were all on the side of the appellants.
('8', 250, 3, 32, 607116) The Court, however, gave no ruling on this point and set aside the conviction on the ground that the resolution fixing the date was never promulgated by publication in the Gazette or in any other way.
('8', 251, 0, 1, 607317) 252 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 251, 1, 2, 607359) the course of his judgment, justice Wessels condemned the action of the municipality as tyrannical and stated that in a civilized country vested rights ought not to be disturbed.
('8', 251, 1, 3, 607538) It is a happy thought that the Supreme Court has always dispensed perfect justice, as it has on this occasion.
('8', 251, 2, 4, 607649) REGISTRATION
('8', 251, 3, 5, 607662) Registration is going on.
('8', 251, 3, 6, 607688) In Pretoria, Mr. Chamney had refused to consider the objection raised by several Indians who were strongly opposed to giving finger prints.
('8', 251, 3, 7, 607828) The question has now been settled.
('8', 251, 3, 8, 607863) The office at Pretoria will be kept open to enable these persons in particular to register.
('8', 251, 3, 9, 607955) It will also open in Johannesburg for a short period with a viewto giving another chance to those who had not applied earlier.
('8', 251, 3, 10, 608082) At the moment, it is going round Pietersburg, Potche fstroom and other towns and it is expected that, by April 10, the submission of applications will have been completed.
('8', 251, 3, 11, 608254) It is assumed that it will then take about a month to issue the registers.
('8', 251, 4, 12, 608329) IMPATIENT INDIANS
('8', 251, 5, 13, 608347) We find that many Indians outside are impatient to enter the Transvaal.
('8', 251, 5, 14, 608419) Some of them manage to get in surreptitiously.
('8', 251, 5, 15, 608466) I must warn all such Indians that they do the community great harm.
('8', 251, 5, 16, 608534) There is no objection to the entry of those who hold valid permits obtained after the war, but others would do well to wait for the present.
('8', 251, 6, 17, 608675) WHITE HAWKERS
('8', 251, 7, 18, 608689) The white hawkers have been much emboldened by Mr. Baileys speech 1 It Krugersdorp.
('8', 251, 7, 19, 608773) They have asked for help to the tune of C200, of which Mr. Bailey has promised to give 150. They want to compete with the Indian hawkers and beat them at their trade.
('8', 251, 7, 20, 608940) The movement does not appear to be particularly strong.
('8', 251, 7, 21, 608996) At the same time, however there can be no doubt that, if such a movement is kept alive and we do nothing about it we shall suffer.
('8', 251, 7, 22, 609127) Let the Indian com munity remember that it has to deal with an enemy who is not likely to give in without a struggle.
('8', 251, 7, 23, 609245) He is brave and will return to the attack again and again.
('8', 251, 7, 24, 609304) Indian hawkers should be especially careful to keep their wares clean, be honest in their dealings and avoid being rude.

('8', 252, 2, 3, 609543) The Association received a telegram from Oudtshoorn (Cape Colony) in which the Chairman, Mr. Mahamed Khan, has stated that a meeting attended by about 40 Indians was held at which a fund was raised to help the Association in its work.
('8', 252, 2, 4, 609778) The proceeds, he said, would be forwarded [to the Association] during the following week.
('8', 252, 2, 5, 609868) The week is out and the money is expected any moment now.

('8', 252, 6, 11, 610245) We are publishing in our Gujarati columns abstract 1 from two letters from correspondents complaining of inadequate accommo dation and other inconveniences on the Natal Direct liners bound for India.
('8', 252, 6, 12, 610445) The passengers complain that latrines are bad and insanitary, deck space is limited and uncomfortable, the holds too small to contain the passengers accepted.
('8', 252, 6, 13, 610604) There are other complaints into which we need not enter at present.
('8', 252, 6, 14, 610672) We draw the attention of the agents and the owners of these vessels to the facts alleged, and trust that the complaints of the deck passengers will be thoroughly investi gated and relief granted, if the complaints are found to be true.

('8', 252, 8, 18, 611025) There are many other reasons for concluding that the British are happy.
('8', 252, 8, 19, 611097) We have often discussed why they are happy and why they rule.
('8', 252, 8, 20, 611159) 2 We have again been led to give thought to this question by an account we have received of a lepers hospital.
('8', 252, 8, 21, 611270) India has a large number of lepers.
('8', 252, 8, 22, 611306) We usually shun them, and keep them at a distance.

('8', 253, 1, 2, 611551) There may be some who do not behave in this way.
('8', 253, 1, 3, 611600) But we do not hear of anyone from among us coming forward to give them medical treatment or to build hospitals for them.
('8', 253, 1, 4, 611721) The task of bringing medical aid to these people appears to have been left to the whites.
('8', 253, 1, 5, 611811) The Hindus have among them a whole class of people whom they may not even touch.
('8', 253, 1, 6, 611892) Members of this class are subjected to severe privations and hardly ever treated as human beings.
('8', 253, 1, 7, 611990) Here again, it is the Europeans who go to their rescue.
('8', 253, 1, 8, 612046) There is a place called Chandkuri in India.
('8', 253, 1, 9, 612090) There, Christian missionaries have established a lepers hospital to which they admit any Indian leper.
('8', 253, 1, 10, 612193) According to pre 1900 census figures, there were at least 100,000 lepers in India.
('8', 253, 1, 11, 612276) Missionaries have established 50 hospitals in which they not only treat them, but also educate them and look after their children, providing them food and clothing.
('8', 253, 1, 12, 612441) They also arrange for their schooling.
('8', 253, 1, 13, 612480) Europeans go out from various countries to take up this work, giving up their own pursuits.
('8', 253, 1, 14, 612572) They are convinced that this is the best way of servinghumanity.
('8', 253, 1, 15, 612637) They look upon it as holy work, which will bring prosperity to them and their people.
('8', 253, 1, 16, 612723) Mr. Anderson, a Canadian millionaire, has gone to work in these hospitals.
('8', 253, 1, 17, 612798) How are these hospitals financed?
('8', 253, 1, 18, 612832) If anyone wants to know, he will find the information in the pamphlet from which we have taken the foregoing.
('8', 253, 1, 19, 612942) The expenses are met from funds raised in England.
('8', 253, 1, 20, 612993) We in India pay only a small part of the expenditure.
('8', 253, 1, 21, 613047) What is the object behind this work?
('8', 253, 1, 22, 613084) The question is simply answered.
('8', 253, 1, 23, 613117) Their aim is, undoubtedly, to convert to Christianity the victims of the disease who go to them.
('8', 253, 1, 24, 613214) But no one is sent away for refusing to be converted.
('8', 253, 1, 25, 613268) Their constant objective is to treat these people, whatever happens.
('8', 253, 1, 26, 613337) Is there any reason why people, who so nobly serve humanity and from among whom thousands come forward for such work, should not prosper?
('8', 253, 1, 27, 613475) Why indeed should they not rule?
('8', 253, 1, 28, 613508) How can Indians expect to prosper if they refuse to shoulder their own burdens of this sort and forsake what is clearly their own duty?
('8', 253, 1, 29, 613644) How can they expect to have swaraj?
('8', 253, 1, 30, 613680) And what will they gain from swaraj?
('8', 253, 1, 31, 613717) It is not as if there were no lepers in England, or other deserving causes [for their money].
('8', 253, 1, 32, 613811) But the British do not depend on others for such work.
('8', 253, 1, 33, 613866) They attend to their tasks themselves.
('8', 253, 1, 34, 613905) We do not accept our own responsibilities, let alone help others.
('8', 253, 1, 35, 613971) We must give thought to these matters.
('8', 253, 1, 36, 614010) We look at the question only superficially, curse the British for denying us our rights and feel triumphant when we have started an agitation to drive them out.
('8', 253, 1, 37, 614171) But this way we only do ourselves harm.
('8', 253, 1, 38, 614211) We forget the real cause.

('8', 254, 1, 2, 614282) It may well be that the British preside over an empire and prosper because of the blessings of these lepers while we live in misery because of their curses.

('8', 254, 2, 4, 614481) 127. CAPE TOWN INDIANS
('8', 254, 3, 5, 614504) The Cape Argus of Cape Town writes as follows: At a time when hundreds of whites are leaving South Africa owing to the lack of employment opportunities, it behoves the authorities to check further immigration.
('8', 254, 3, 6, 614714) It would be highly absurd if, while there was a continuous exodus of white men, there should also be a corresponding influx of Asiatics.
('8', 254, 3, 7, 614851) It appears from letter we have received that there is ground at least for suspicion that the Act is not being implemented with the ne cessary thoroughness.
('8', 254, 3, 8, 615007) This maybe due to defects in the law.
('8', 254, 3, 9, 615045) Our correspondent statesthat 200 Asiatics have landed claiming to be under sixteen; they say that their fathers are here but that their mothers are in India.
('8', 254, 3, 10, 615203) This is too significant to be passed over.
('8', 254, 3, 11, 615246) These remarks of The Cape Argus should be taken seriously.
('8', 254, 3, 12, 615305) It should be remembered that The Cape is not normally hostile to Indians.
('8', 254, 3, 13, 615379) How is it then that it writes in this vein?
('8', 254, 3, 14, 615423) Can it be that we have been at fault?
('8', 254, 3, 15, 615461) When anything is said or done against us, it is a golden rule first to look for faults in ourselves.
('8', 254, 3, 16, 615562) We do not know whether any unlawful practices are employed in connection with the immigration of Indians.
('8', 254, 3, 17, 615668) We have no personal experience to go by.
('8', 254, 3, 18, 615709) But we can infer from what is happening in Natal and elsewhere that, to some extent, we must be at fault.
('8', 254, 3, 19, 615815) If there is any truth in the above allegation, it should give the Cape Indians food for thought.
('8', 254, 3, 20, 615912) The present situation, in South Africa does not conduce to the immigration of Indians in large numbers.
('8', 254, 3, 21, 616016) It is essential that such immigration should not be allowed to go on.
('8', 254, 3, 22, 616086) Similar complaints are being received from the Transvaal also.
('8', 254, 3, 23, 616149) It is said that people have been entering the country surreptitiously.
('8', 254, 3, 24, 616220) How can this be prevented?
('8', 254, 3, 25, 616247) It is a difficult question to answer.
('8', 254, 3, 26, 616285) But it must be realized that the honour of the Indian community depends on a solution being found for this problem.

('8', 255, 1, 2, 616485) 128. LICENCE CASE AT DUNDEE
('8', 255, 2, 3, 616513) The refusal of a licence to Mr. Cassim Ghulam in Dundee is a grave injustice.
('8', 255, 2, 4, 616591) It is stated that the ground for this refusal is that he has thrice compromised with his creditors.
('8', 255, 2, 5, 616691) Even if a person seeks settlement with his creditors thirty times, why should that create any difficulty about issuing a licence to him?
('8', 255, 2, 6, 616828) Only those devoid of any sense of justice would give such a judgment.
('8', 255, 2, 7, 616898) When the lion in the fable wanted to kill the lamb, he charged him with muddying the water in the river.
('8', 255, 2, 8, 617003) The hapless lamb replied that he was drinking down stream while the lion was up stream.
('8', 255, 2, 9, 617091) The prince of a lion roared, If not you, your father must have done that, saying which he ate up the lamb.
('8', 255, 2, 10, 617198) Some of the licensing officers and the Licensing Board itself have been behaving in much the same manner.
('8', 255, 2, 11, 617304) When the Indians cease to be lambs and become lions, the licensing officers will have a hard time of it.
('8', 255, 2, 12, 617409) For, as usually happens, the pupil will go one better than the teacher.
('8', 255, 2, 13, 617481) Will the Indian lion wake up?

('8', 255, 4, 16, 617582) In this issue we publish two letters which complain of severe hardships to passengers on Natal Direct Line steamers.
('8', 255, 4, 17, 617699) The letters do give the impression that the inconveniences are real.
('8', 255, 4, 18, 617768) We take it to be a good sign that Indian passengers have begun to complain about them.
('8', 255, 4, 19, 617855) The only reason why white passengers get so many facilities on steamers is that they do not put up with inconveniences without demur.
('8', 255, 4, 20, 617989) We draw the attention of the agents of the Line to the two letters.
('8', 255, 4, 21, 618057) It is their duty to investigate the complaints thoroughly and set matters right.

('8', 255, 7, 25, 618226) There is a rumour that permitless Indians are crossing over into the Transvaal from all directions.
('8', 255, 7, 26, 618326) If there are any Indians thus

('8', 256, 1, 2, 618458) entering the Transvaal unlawfully, they will doubtless suffer in the end and other Indians along with them.
('8', 256, 1, 3, 618566) Those who want to come in unlawfully had better be careful of what they do.
('8', 256, 1, 4, 618642) If, earlier, there had been no dishonesty in this matter, the Asiatic Act would never have been called into existence.
('8', 256, 1, 5, 618761) Since, however, the leaders are not behind such activities and do not want to play foul with the Government, the Acting Chairman, Mr. Coovadia, has sent the following letter to the Government: My Association has received information that a few Asiatics enter the Transvaal without permits, some of them on foot.
('8', 256, 1, 6, 619073) My Association does not know what checks exist at the border.
('8', 256, 1, 7, 619135) But since it is my Associations intention to assist the Government in preventing the entry of unauthorized persons, it suggests that strict watch be kept at the border and on the trains.
('8', 256, 1, 8, 619322) My Association believes that this can be done without being harsh on anyone.
('8', 256, 1, 9, 619399) Prosecution of those entering the Transvaal without permits or similar authority will not imply any breach of the compromise.
('8', 256, 1, 10, 619525) My Association believes that these persons can be prosecuted under the immigration Act.
('8', 256, 2, 11, 619613) ASIATIC BAZAAR
('8', 256, 3, 12, 619628) The Klerksdorp Chaber has resolved to send the Asiatics to Locations and to confine their trade within those Locations.
('8', 256, 3, 13, 619748) The Chamber wrote to the Potchefstroom Chamber seeking As support on this question, but the latter did not endorse the resolution, arguing that the Indians could not be sent to Locations unless they were paid compensation.
('8', 256, 3, 14, 619971) The [Potchefstroom] Chamber has accordingly refused to write to the Government.
('8', 256, 4, 15, 620051) FREEDOM FOR BLACKS TO DRINK
('8', 256, 5, 16, 620079) There is a movement in Pretoria against prohibition among Coloured persons.
('8', 256, 5, 17, 620155) According to newspaper reports, there is a person named Cassi who plays a leading part in this movement.
('8', 256, 5, 18, 620260) Meetings have been held at Pretoria on this question.
('8', 256, 5, 19, 620314) A petition to the Transvaal Government has been drafted.
('8', 256, 5, 20, 620371) The petition argues that Coloured persons can get liquor despite the prohibidon.
('8', 256, 5, 21, 620452) A large number of whites exploit the situation to fleece the people.
('8', 256, 5, 22, 620521) Since Coloured persons do in any case drink on the sly, it would be better to let them do so openly.
('8', 256, 5, 23, 620622) Being obliged to drink surreptitiously, they gulp down whatever they can lay hands on and get drunk.
('8', 256, 5, 24, 620723) The petitioners argue that, instead of all in this to continue, everyone may be permitted to drink.
('8', 256, 5, 25, 620823) A large number of natures are being obtained from Coloured persons.
('8', 256, 5, 26, 620891) They cannot get any Indians to sign it, and I hope that no

('8', 257, 1, 3, 621004) I see the hand of whites behind this petition.
('8', 257, 1, 4, 621051) The Dutch rulers are inclined to allow the Coloured persons some freedom to drink.
('8', 257, 1, 5, 621134) 1 If there had been no agitation in England against such a move, a Bill to this effect would have been passed during the last session of Parliament.
('8', 257, 1, 6, 621283) I know that some Indians buy liquor illegally, and drink it too.
('8', 257, 1, 7, 621348) Even those who drink know that it is a bad habit, but they do not give it up.
('8', 257, 1, 8, 621426) They think it is a habit which cannot be broken.
('8', 257, 1, 9, 621475) They do not realize that they show little spirit in holding on to this believe If they take their courage in both hands and get rid of the habit, they will do themselves as well as their community a lot of good.
('8', 257, 2, 10, 621687) CONCEALED KNIFE
('8', 257, 3, 11, 621703) Not only does the Government attack us with unsheathed swords, but it also has concealed knives in its armoury.
('8', 257, 3, 12, 621815) Last year a law was passed about the keeping of dogs as pets.
('8', 257, 3, 13, 621877) Normally one would not read such a law.
('8', 257, 3, 14, 621917) I did not read it myself.
('8', 257, 3, 15, 621943) It is only when they enforce the law that we discover that it subjects us to further harassment.
('8', 257, 3, 16, 622040) Some Indians residing out the municipal limits keep dogs.
('8', 257, 3, 17, 622098) The Government says that they should pay ten shillings ayear for keeping one.
('8', 257, 3, 18, 622176) The whites can register their dogs without paying a fee, while Indians and other Coloured persons are required to pay it.
('8', 257, 3, 19, 622298) Indians in mofussil areas are seriously concerned as to what they should do about it.
('8', 257, 3, 20, 622384) Some of them are preparing to take the matter to court.
('8', 257, 3, 21, 622440) I think this law cannot be enforced, for it does not contain any clause about Royal assent.
('8', 257, 3, 22, 622532) It is necessary for all laws entailing racial discrimination to have such a clause.
('8', 257, 3, 23, 622616) Mr. Nagadi has taken up the question.
('8', 257, 3, 24, 622654) Further information can be had from him.
('8', 257, 4, 25, 622695) ADMIRATION FOR INDIANS
('8', 257, 5, 26, 622718) Pretoria News has a long article on registration which says that the Indians and the Chinese have assisted the authorities and have behaved satisfactorily.
('8', 257, 5, 27, 622874) Registration has so far gone on without difficulty.
('8', 257, 5, 28, 622926) There have been very few cases in which objections could be raised.
('8', 257, 6, 29, 622994) ADVOCATE POLAK
('8', 257, 7, 30, 623009) The editor of this journal, Mr. Polak, was enrolled as an Attorney last Monday.
('8', 257, 7, 31, 623089) The reader will recall that Mr. Polak has been busy with his legal studies during the last three years.
('8', 257, 7, 32, 623193) He has taken the London Matriculation Examination and passed other examinations as well.
('8', 257, 7, 33, 623282) He knows French nearly as well as he does English.

('8', 258, 2, 5, 623712) LICENCE
('8', 258, 3, 6, 623720) Indians who have not taken out licences had better do so expeditiously.
('8', 258, 3, 7, 623792) Those who hold new registers will get a licence for the whole year on the production of their registers.
('8', 258, 3, 8, 623897) Those who do not have the registers will get licences [which will be valid] up to June 30. But applications for these should be made before the 30th of this month.
('8', 258, 3, 9, 624061) Anyone who fails to do so is likely to be prosecuted in May.
('8', 258, 3, 10, 624122) It is therefore essential that every Indian [trader] hurries up and gets himself a licence.

('8', 258, 5, 13, 624429) In Benoni, applications will be received on the 13th, 14th and 15th; in Volksrust, on the 13th and 14th; in Potchefstroom and Krugersdorp, on the 16th, 17th and 18th.

('8', 258, 7, 16, 624677) I cannot tell, O Athenians, how far you have been carried away by my accusers words.
('8', 258, 7, 17, 624762) For my own part, they nearly made me forget who I was, so plausible were they.
('8', 258, 7, 18, 624841) But I say that their arguments are a lie.
('8', 258, 7, 19, 624883) Among their falsehoods there was one which astonished me most.
('8', 258, 7, 20, 624946) They asked you not to be misled by my eloquence.
('8', 258, 7, 21, 624995) It is they who are rhetorical.
('8', 258, 7, 22, 625026) I have no skill in the art of speaking.
('8', 258, 7, 23, 625066) If by rhetoric they mean truth, I admit that I possess it.
('8', 258, 7, 24, 625125) However, if they allow that I am a.
('8', 258, 7, 25, 625161) truthful person, I am not an orator in their sense of the word.
('8', 258, 7, 26, 625225) For they have spoken with dazzling effect, but there is nothing of truth in their words.
('8', 258, 7, 27, 625314) For my part, I shall place before you the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
('8', 258, 7, 28, 625395) I have not come to you with a prepared speech.
('8', 258, 7, 29, 625442) I am an old man.
('8', 258, 7, 30, 625459) It is not for me to speak before you eloquently or in brilliant words.
('8', 258, 7, 31, 625530) Do not be surprised, therefore, if I speak as simply as I am used to.
('8', 258, 7, 32, 625600) I am now more than seventy years old, and this is my first experience of a law court.
('8', 258, 7, 33, 625686) I am thus a stranger to the dignified ways of a court and to the manner of speech appropriate to it.

('8', 259, 1, 2, 625905) or not what I say is just.
('8', 259, 1, 3, 625932) My duty is to place before you nothing but the truth.
('8', 259, 1, 4, 625986) My accusers are many in number.
('8', 259, 1, 5, 626018) One of the charges is that I inquire into all things and make the worse appear the better reason, and so mislead the people.
('8', 259, 1, 6, 626143) Those who accuse me thus are powerful persons.
('8', 259, 1, 7, 626190) They say that I do not adhere to the religion of our forefathers.
('8', 259, 1, 8, 626256) Moreover, they made these accusations when I was not there and it was therefore impossible for me to defend myself.
('8', 259, 1, 9, 626372) I hope that your hearts will be freed from the bias created by their malicious or cunning reports.
('8', 259, 1, 10, 626471) Nevertheless, I know that my task is a difficult one.
('8', 259, 1, 11, 626525) I shall say what is needful, be the issue as God wills it.
('8', 259, 1, 12, 626584) I mentioned a while ago the substance of their charge against me.
('8', 259, 1, 13, 626650) They also lampoon me in plays 1 and show me as trying to walk on air.
('8', 259, 1, 14, 626720) I have not even thought about these things.
('8', 259, 1, 15, 626764) I do not mean to suggest that it is impossible to walk on air.
('8', 259, 1, 16, 626827) If anyone can do so, let him try by all means.
('8', 259, 1, 17, 626874) For my part I have no knowledge of these matters, yet Meletus has made a charge against me to that effect.
('8', 259, 1, 18, 626981) Many of you here in this assembly have known me for a long time.
('8', 259, 1, 19, 627046) You may consult among yourselves and find out whether I have ever talked to anyone on these matters.
('8', 259, 1, 20, 627147) If all of you agree that I have not, you will see that the other charges against me must be equally false.
('8', 259, 1, 21, 627254) My accusers say, moreover, that I undertake to educate men and demand payment of money in return.
('8', 259, 1, 22, 627352) This, again, is false.
('8', 259, 1, 23, 627375) Even if it were true, I see nothing wrong in it.
('8', 259, 1, 24, 627424) There are many teachers among us who ask to be paid for their work.
('8', 259, 1, 25, 627492) If they do their teaching welland are paid for it, I see no dishonour in that.
('8', 259, 1, 26, 627571) If we owned an animal, we would engage a man to train it and pay him for his work.
('8', 259, 1, 27, 627654) Why then should we not teach our children to be good, to do their duty as citizens?
('8', 259, 1, 28, 627738) And if we found a teacher who might lead them along the right path, why should we not pay him?
('8', 259, 1, 29, 627833) But, speaking for myself, I have not had the opportunity to be such a teacher.
('8', 259, 1, 30, 627912) You may well ask me, If you have no faults, why is it that so many accusations are brought against you?
('8', 259, 1, 31, 628016) If you have done nothing to mislead the people why are these accusations made against you and not against someone else? This would not be an unfair question to ask.
('8', 259, 1, 32, 628181) I shall endeavour to show why these charges have been brought against me.
('8', 259, 1, 33, 628255) Perhaps you think that I am jesting.
('8', 259, 1, 34, 628292) Be assured, however, that I speak nothing but the truth.
('8', 259, 1, 35, 628349) The reason for their accusations is that I possess a certain wisdom.
('8', 259, 1, 36, 628418) If you ask, What kind of wisdom? I

('8', 260, 1, 2, 628708) can only say that, although it be but human wisdom, even the oracle 1 has said that I have more of it than others.
('8', 260, 1, 3, 628823) Though these are the words of the oracle, I did not readily believe them.
('8', 260, 1, 4, 628897) Accordingly, I went to one reputed to be the wisest among us.
('8', 260, 1, 5, 628959) I asked him a few questions and discovered that his was only a pretence to knowledge.
('8', 260, 1, 6, 629045) I make no such claim.
('8', 260, 1, 7, 629067) To that extent, therefore, I must be wiser than he is.
('8', 260, 1, 8, 629122) For he who knows the extent of his own ignorance is wiser than another who does not.
('8', 260, 1, 9, 629207) But when I proved his ignorance to that learned man, he came to bear me a grudge.
('8', 260, 1, 10, 629289) Then I went to another person of learning.
('8', 260, 1, 11, 629332) He also laid claim to knowledge which was only a cover for his ignorance.
('8', 260, 1, 12, 629406) I proved the truth to him and thus made an enemy of him.
('8', 260, 1, 13, 629463) I approached a large number of men in this manner, and all of them tried to shield their ignorance.
('8', 260, 1, 14, 629563) I showed to each one of them how ignorant he was and so incurred his displeasure.
('8', 260, 1, 15, 629645) I observed that the greater the pretence to knowledge the greater in fact the darkness.
('8', 260, 1, 16, 629733) I also came to realize that true knowledge consists in being aware of how utterly ignorant one is.
('8', 260, 1, 17, 629832) I went to many a poet and many an artisan.
('8', 260, 1, 18, 629875) I found that a large number of poets could not explain the meaning of their compositions.
('8', 260, 1, 19, 629965) The artisans were certainly superior [to me] in virtue of their skill, but out of pride in their skill, they assumed themselves to be wiser than others in other matters as well.
('8', 260, 1, 20, 630143) All of them are really steeped in ignorance withoutknowing it.
('8', 260, 1, 21, 630206) I learnt that I was more fully aware than any of them of the true state of our ignorance. [From Gujarati] Indian Opinion, 11 4 1908

('8', 260, 3, 23, 630371) The following account appeared in the Egyptian Press of the peoples grief at the death of Mustafa Kamal Pasha.
('8', 260, 3, 24, 630482) As the news spread of Mustafa Kamal Pashas death a deep gloom fell [over Cairo] and people collected in large numbers in front of the offices of Luwa Old men broke into wails of childlike grief.
('8', 260, 3, 25, 630677) The young and the middle aged cried aloud.
('8', 260, 3, 26, 630720) It was an altogether mournful scene, such that even a heart of stone could not but be moved.
('8', 260, 3, 27, 630813) All through the day crowds thronged in front of the offices of Luwa.
('8', 260, 3, 28, 630882) A tent which had been put up there was filled to overflowing with people overcome with grief.
('8', 260, 3, 29, 630976) The lamentation that rose when the

('8', 261, 1, 2, 631065) bier left Mustafa Kamal Pashas house is impossible to describe.
('8', 261, 1, 3, 631129) Tears flowed freely from the eyes of [even] the most self controlled of men.
('8', 261, 1, 4, 631206) The air became thick with the cries of women and others.
('8', 261, 1, 5, 631263) The bier was covered with the Egyptian flag.
('8', 261, 1, 6, 631308) On reaching the high road, people formed a procession and followed [the bier] solemnly.
('8', 261, 1, 7, 631396) At the head were the students of Mustafa Kamal Pashas school.
('8', 261, 1, 8, 631458) The students of the Khedives schools of law and medicine carried black flags.
('8', 261, 1, 9, 631536) Students of other schools, too, joined the procession, all carrying different symbols of mourning.
('8', 261, 1, 10, 631635) Along with the other mourners, the procession was more than a hundred thousand strong.
('8', 261, 1, 11, 631722) It is said that this huge procession extended over three miles.
('8', 261, 1, 12, 631786) Because of the crowds, vehicular traffic had been suspended on the roads along the route of the procession.
('8', 261, 1, 13, 631894) At some places the crowds were so dense that people found it difficult even to walk.
('8', 261, 1, 14, 631979) There were tears in the eyes of the policemen who patrolled [the roads] to prevent accidents and maintain law and order.
('8', 261, 1, 15, 632100) Along the route, every window, every terrace was crowded with humanity and all round one saw men, women and children weeping bitterly for their beloved leader.
('8', 261, 1, 16, 632260) It was an agonizing scene.
('8', 261, 1, 17, 632287) Moving slowly, the procession first made for the Casoun Mosque, from where it resumed its course after a twenty minutes prayer.
('8', 261, 1, 18, 632415) As it approached its destination, one could see wave upon wave of griefstricken humanity advancing from all directions.
('8', 261, 1, 19, 632535) For some time the people could not bring themselves to lower the coffin into the grave.
('8', 261, 1, 20, 632623) The burial took place to the accompaniment of a dirge composed by Ismail Pasha Sabri, Head of the Department of Justice.
('8', 261, 1, 21, 632744) People were so deeply moved by the dirge that their grief found vent in bitter sobbing.
('8', 261, 1, 22, 632832) The following are some of the verses from the dirge.
('8', 261, 1, 23, 632885) O grave, offer respectful welcome to yourguest.
('8', 261, 1, 24, 632933) The Egyptian people had put their hopes in him.
('8', 261, 1, 25, 632981) That a great patriot like you, with a heart so noble, should have passed away in the prime of his life, is a grief too heavy to bear.
('8', 261, 1, 26, 633115) You showed us the path of success.
('8', 261, 1, 27, 633150) We shall defend the edifice of national progress that you have raised.
('8', 261, 1, 28, 633221) You never encouraged indulgence in tears of grief, but permit us this day to drown in grief.
('8', 261, 1, 29, 633314) From the morrow, firm as a rock, we shall resume the work that you have left behind.
('8', 261, 1, 30, 633399) The funeral was attended by a large number of prominent persons.
('8', 261, 1, 31, 633464) February 10 was a day of mourning for those who aspire for a free Egypt.
('8', 261, 1, 32, 633537) In the entire history of Cairo, there had been no instance
('8', 262, 0, 1, 633596) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 263
('8', 262, 1, 2, 633641) of such deep mourning.
('8', 262, 1, 3, 633664) It is said that those who were in the funeral procession will not forget the day for a long time to come.

('8', 262, 2, 5, 633812) 133. BRITISH WOMEN AS SATYAGRAHIS
('8', 262, 3, 6, 633846) We have always compared the Indian satyagraha movement with that of the British suffragettes.
('8', 262, 3, 7, 633940) 1 The brave women of England are continuing their campaign.
('8', 262, 3, 8, 634000) They started their movement earlier than we did ours, and no one can say when it will end.
('8', 262, 3, 9, 634091) But their courage and their capacity for suffering are inexhaustible.
('8', 262, 3, 10, 634161) Many women have been to gaol for their rights.
('8', 262, 3, 11, 634208) One of them has narrated her experie nces in a newspaper and these ought to shame us and inspire us to greater courage.
('8', 262, 3, 12, 634328) Our sufferings are as nothing compared to what she has had to go through.
('8', 262, 3, 13, 634402) She writes: After we were led out of the quadrangle where we were first detained, we were asked to give our names, ages, addresses, etc.
('8', 262, 3, 14, 634539) We look upon these questions as a form of popular welcome to those who have arrived to enjoy the hospitality of gaol.
('8', 262, 3, 15, 634657) After such particulars as our names, etc., had been noted, we went in to don our prison uniforms of coarse cloth.
('8', 262, 3, 16, 634771) First, we were required to stand barefooted, with just a kind of gown over each of us, while they made an inventory of our personal clothes, jewellery, etc.
('8', 262, 3, 17, 634928) After we had been weighed, our hair was undone and examinedfor infection.
('8', 262, 3, 18, 635002) For a few minutes, we were required to immerse our feet in warm water, after which we put on the rest of the prison uniform.
('8', 262, 3, 19, 635127) Over the dress was a belt with the prisoners number on it.
('8', 262, 3, 20, 635186) A piece of cloth was given to each of us for handkerchief.
('8', 262, 3, 21, 635245) There being no pockets, it was loosely pinned on to the dress.
('8', 262, 3, 22, 635308) We were not permitted to wash it oftener than once in eight days, no allowance being made for the possibility of the public guest (the prisoner) catching cold.
('8', 262, 3, 23, 635468) We were given stockings similar to cycling stockings, which did not reach up to the knees.
('8', 262, 3, 24, 635559) There were no garters either, and when we were taken out on a walk round the gaol lasting half an hour, the stockings would slip down, which was very embarrassing.
('8', 262, 3, 25, 635723) The shoes provided were made of the coarsest hide.
('8', 262, 3, 26, 635774) What with numerous patches and stitches, they had become very heavy.
('8', 262, 3, 27, 635843) The nails from the soles

('8', 263, 1, 2, 636036) protruded so much that soon our feet and stockings were heavily pierced.
('8', 263, 1, 3, 636109) When we complained about this to the wardress, she dumped a pile of old shoes before us and asked us to choose the pairs with the fewest nails protruding.
('8', 263, 1, 4, 636264) At night, we were locked up in our basement [cell].
('8', 263, 1, 5, 636316) We slept on wooden boards covered with coir mattresses and were given a thin blanket each to cover ourselves with.
('8', 263, 1, 6, 636431) Sleep, of course, there was none.
('8', 263, 1, 7, 636465) At six on winter mornings, when it was still dark, a bell was sounded to call us out of bed.
('8', 263, 1, 8, 636558) Sometimes, after getting up, I put on the day clothing over the night dress.
('8', 263, 1, 9, 636635) I was compelled to do this as the nights were very cold.
('8', 263, 1, 10, 636692) We then washed in a tin basin and did our hair as well as we could without a looking glass.
('8', 263, 1, 11, 636784) It would be time by then for the doors to open, and we were asked to go and fetch water.
('8', 263, 1, 12, 636873) We then had bread and cocoaI do not know what the latter tastes like, never having taken it myselfafter which we washed the cell.
('8', 263, 1, 13, 637003) This practice, which appeared to me to be altogether absurd and foolish, has come down from old times.
('8', 263, 1, 14, 637106) After we had washed the cell and had replaced the wooden spoons and prayer books on the shelves, we were called upon to sew canvas bags for use in post offices.
('8', 263, 1, 15, 637267) Then we said our prayers for half an hour30 to 40 of us togetherwith the wardress in front watching lest we should talk among ourselves.
('8', 263, 1, 16, 637404) After half an hours exercise, we were locked up in the cell forthe day, everyone being set some very hard task.
('8', 263, 1, 17, 637516) Lunch came to the accompaniment of jingling of keys and creaking of doors.
('8', 263, 1, 18, 637591) The few courses included potato, which was the only thing I ate.
('8', 263, 1, 19, 637656) For dinner, we had bread with tea or cocoa.
('8', 263, 1, 20, 637700) They would then take away the scissors which had been given us for cutting thestrong string used in sewing the.
('8', 263, 1, 21, 637812) mail bags, the object being, probably, to leave no means to tempt anyone to commit suicide because of the extreme cold at night.
('8', 263, 1, 22, 637941) I was told later that garters were not supplied for the same reason.
('8', 263, 1, 23, 638010) Prisoners are not allowed to receive letters, nor to send out any.
('8', 263, 1, 24, 638077) If a letter arrived for any prisoner the authorities read it and returned it to the sender with the remark that prisoners were not entitled to receive letters.

('8', 264, 2, 3, 638356) For the first time after assuming office the Natal Governor has spoken on the Indian question.
('8', 264, 2, 4, 638451) Speaking at the annual conference of the Natal Agricultural Union, he suggested that they should depend more on Kaffir than on Indian labour; otherwise, he added, it would not be possible to treat the Asiatics already in the country with that fairness which it was in the white mans nature to extend to other, weaker races.
('8', 264, 2, 5, 638775) This speech gives rise to two thoughts.
('8', 264, 2, 6, 638815) Examining its impli cations we see that [ultimately] it is in the interests of the Indians that the Governor has spoken.
('8', 264, 2, 7, 638936) He has warned the whites that, if the Indian immigration continues, Natal will eventually come to be dominated by them.
('8', 264, 2, 8, 639056) Let us thank Sir Mathew Nathan for wanting to do justice by the Indians.
('8', 264, 2, 9, 639129) But duty demands that we look at both sides of a question, the good and the bad, and weigh the two.
('8', 264, 2, 10, 639229) We must not be elated and swept off our feet by the good that we may expect to find.
('8', 264, 2, 11, 639314) Equally, we must not give way to despair and anger.
('8', 264, 2, 12, 639366) Looking at the Indian question from this point of view, we find that the concluding words of the Governors speech are not justified by facts.
('8', 264, 2, 13, 639508) He says that it is in the nature of the whites to deal fairly with other, weaker races.
('8', 264, 2, 14, 639596) This implies that Indians are weak and will remain so, at least for some time to come.
('8', 264, 2, 15, 639683) The whites have always done justice and will go on doing it, for the present at any rate.
('8', 264, 2, 16, 639773) We shall not blame him for assuming the Indians to be weak, for we have become weak and are content to remain so.
('8', 264, 2, 17, 639887) People are bound to point their [accusing] finger at us.
('8', 264, 2, 18, 639944) But the Governor had no right to place such views before the whites.
('8', 264, 2, 19, 640013) It was unbecoming of him to have done so.
('8', 264, 2, 20, 640055) We have been further degraded in their eyes.
('8', 264, 2, 21, 640100) The remedy, however, is in our own hands.
('8', 264, 2, 22, 640142) We were weak but are not so any longer, and even if we are, we must resolve not to remain weak.
('8', 264, 2, 23, 640238) Being strong, we shall fight for our rights and our honour.
('8', 264, 2, 24, 640298) When we think in this vein, we must not imagine that strong means physically strong or that fight means fight with swords and guns.
('8', 264, 2, 25, 640430) It is indeed necessary to be physically strong.
('8', 264, 2, 26, 640478) If the Indians want to learn the use of fire arms and swords, by all means let them do so.
('8', 264, 2, 27, 640569) But they will always remain strong if they have the weapon of truth in their hands, and will succeed even against those who have guns at their command.
('8', 264, 2, 28, 640721) The most important reason why we should not assume that it is because of our frail physique that we are
('8', 265, 0, 1, 640825) 266 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 265, 1, 2, 640867) thought weak is that the Kaffirs are thought weak by the whites despite their superior physical strength.
('8', 265, 1, 3, 640973) They are intellectually backward.
('8', 265, 1, 4, 641007) They are unlettered and have no arts.
('8', 265, 1, 5, 641045) We can say that, despite the whites physical strength, their arts, their industry and their education, we will be able to defeat them if we are truthful.
('8', 265, 1, 6, 641199) Whatever education and other things are needful will come to us as a matter of course.
('8', 265, 1, 7, 641286) We can find hundreds of instances of their having come in this manner [to a people].
('8', 265, 1, 8, 641371) But we shall soon find that, if we want to be accepted as strong by cultivating truth, we must concur in the Colonys view that there is a large enough population of Indians here for the present.
('8', 265, 1, 9, 641566) There should be no objection to the entry of those who have a legal right to come in.
('8', 265, 1, 10, 641652) But we must put an end to the illicit immigration and wel come the prohibition on the immigration of indentured labour.
('8', 265, 1, 11, 641772) If the Indians already settled here can win the respect and status due to them, other disabilities will disappear.

('8', 265, 3, 14, 641954) It is essential that the Delagoa Bay Indians wake up and become vigilant.
('8', 265, 3, 15, 642028) We draw their attention to the regulations for Asiatics whichhave been published in that Colony.
('8', 265, 3, 16, 642125) They were published a long time ago.
('8', 265, 3, 17, 642162) We have already commented on them earlier.
('8', 265, 3, 18, 642205) 1 We find it neces sary to repeat the warning.
('8', 265, 3, 19, 642252) If the regulations remain in force for any length of time, it will be difficult to challenge them afterwards.
('8', 265, 3, 20, 642362) Tho ugh the Portuguese subjects are fully protected under these regula tions, a large number of Indians who are not Portuguese subjects will forfeit their rights.
('8', 265, 3, 21, 642525) The regulations require that Indians carry a num ber of passes when they move about.
('8', 265, 3, 22, 642610) There are many other hardships also.
('8', 265, 3, 23, 642647) From a telegram we have received we learn that the Chinese are putting up a strong fight against the regulations.
('8', 265, 3, 24, 642761) It is for this reason that the Chairman of the Chinese [Association in the Transvaal] has left for Delagoa Bay.
('8', 265, 3, 25, 642873) As we write, a move is afoot to send Mr. Polak with him.
('8', 265, 3, 26, 642930) We hope that, if Mr. Polak does go, the Indian leaders will help him in doing everything necessary to resist the law.
('8', 265, 3, 27, 643048) Also, we take

('8', 266, 3, 5, 643320) We print elsewhere a heart rending account of the condition of Lobito Bay Indian.
('8', 266, 3, 6, 643402) 1 They are in Natal, a stones throw from Durban.
('8', 266, 3, 7, 643451) It appears that the Government has put them in quarantine with the intention ultimately of sending them back to India.
('8', 266, 3, 8, 643570) It is said that these Indians do not even have any clothes to wear.
('8', 266, 3, 9, 643638) It is only right that Mr. Dawad Mahomed, Mr. Dada Osman, Mr. Anglia and others start immediate relief measures.
('8', 266, 3, 10, 643750) The work should be taken up by men like Mr. Parsee Rustomjee, who occupy leading positions but are not office bearers of the Congress.
('8', 266, 3, 11, 643885) This is what should be done.
('8', 266, 3, 12, 643914) With the permission of the authorities, they should meet these people and hear their story.
('8', 266, 3, 13, 644006) If employment can be found for any of them, a petition should be addressed [to the authorities] with a view to securing permission for them to stay on in Natal.
('8', 266, 3, 14, 644167) If they do not have food to eat, a fund should be raised for feeding them.
('8', 266, 3, 15, 644242) If they are without clothes, they should be given clothes to cover them selves with.
('8', 266, 3, 16, 644327) It is not as if this work was the exclusive responsibility of the Congress.
('8', 266, 3, 17, 644403) It should be attended to by everyIndian who can spare the time.
('8', 266, 3, 18, 644467) With a little effort one will be able to render a great public service.
('8', 266, 3, 19, 644539) For the Congress, at any rate, this is a matter of duty.
('8', 266, 3, 20, 644596) The Congress workers, who are trustees of the Indians, will find that it is
('8', 266, 4, 21, 644672) 1 In 1906, an English engineer named Stone recruited some Natal Indians to work on the Benguella Railway at Lobito Bay in Portuguese Africa.
('8', 266, 4, 22, 644813) According to reports in Indian Opinion of that time, the conditions of work were trying.
('8', 266, 4, 23, 644902) There was no fresh water and only small quantities of foul and oily water were available for drinking.
('8', 266, 4, 24, 645005) They were given white rice and bad dhal, with the result that about half the number of labourers died within three months of their arrival.
('8', 266, 4, 25, 645145) After about 11 months they started leaving the place in batches500 arriving in Natal in March, and 429 in April, 1908. The latter were put in quarantine at Bluff before being sent back to India and their condition was miserable indeed.
('8', 266, 4, 26, 645381) Dawad Mahomed of the Natal Indian Congress visited them at the Bluff Quarantine Camp and in April, the Congress telegraphed the Colonial Secretary at Maritzburg to inquire what arrangements had been made for them in India.
('8', 266, 4, 27, 645604) Congress officials attempted to see them again but permission was refused.

('8', 267, 2, 5, 645953) 137. IMPORTANT CASE AT THE CAPE
('8', 267, 3, 6, 645985) Impelled by the reports in newspapers of the case against four Indian boys in the Cape, we called for a special report through Reuter.
('8', 267, 3, 7, 646120) The following is the substance of the telegram we have received.
('8', 267, 3, 8, 646185) We believe our readers will be happy to read this correct version.
('8', 267, 3, 9, 646252) Often English papers do not report the full news in such cases.
('8', 267, 3, 10, 646316) Calling for a special message puts us to some extra expense but we thereby discover important facts.
('8', 267, 3, 11, 646417) We therefore intend in future to follow this practice whenever necessary.
('8', 267, 3, 12, 646491) The Reuter message says that the authorities refused the four boys permission to land.
('8', 267, 3, 13, 646578) Their case was that, since their parents were domiciled in the Cape and since they themselves were under sixteen, they were entitled to be admitted.
('8', 267, 3, 14, 646727) Four doctors testified that the boys were above sixteen.
('8', 267, 3, 15, 646784) Seven doctors Dr. Curry among themdeposed that they were under sixteen.
('8', 267, 3, 16, 646856) Dr. Curry said in his evidence that he had had a good deal of experience [of conditions] in India.
('8', 267, 3, 17, 646955) The Mahomedans in the area to which the boys belonged were known to possess a good physique.
('8', 267, 3, 18, 647048) The doctor therefore concluded that, the boys being Mahomedans, they had the sort of physique one would expect of boys under sixteen.
('8', 267, 3, 19, 647182) The Supreme Court accepted this evidence and ordered that the boys be permitted to land.

('8', 267, 5, 22, 647338) INDIAN SATYAGRAHIS
('8', 267, 6, 23, 647357) Mr. Coovadia, Treasurer to the Association, has left for India.
('8', 267, 6, 24, 647421) He will very probably not return.
('8', 267, 6, 25, 647455) He has spent a third of his life in South Africa.
('8', 267, 6, 26, 647505) We can therefore appreciate his desire to spend the rest of his days in India, in prayer and in the promotion of public welfare.
('8', 267, 6, 27, 647634) The Hamidia Society gave him an excellent farewell party on Sunday.
('8', 267, 6, 28, 647702) On the same day, Mr. Coovadia also gave a dinner at his place [to friends].
('8', 267, 6, 29, 647778) Mr. Coovadia did fine work during the satyagraha campaign.
('8', 268, 0, 1, 647837) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 269
('8', 268, 1, 2, 647882) He kept his nerve till the end, persuaded those whom he could to rem ain firm and kept up enthusiasm among the people through his spe eches.
('8', 268, 1, 3, 648023) Though he had a large business, [and so had more to lose,] he cheerfully risked losses along with other businessmen.
('8', 268, 1, 4, 648140) He also went round, during the movement, collecting contributions.
('8', 268, 1, 5, 648207) I pray that he may be granted a long life and be enabled to devote himself to good works.
('8', 268, 1, 6, 648297) Like Mr. Coovadia, Mr. Alibhai Akuji and Mr. Alibhai Maho med played a splendid role in the movement.
('8', 268, 1, 7, 648399) These two gentlemen are also leaving for India.
('8', 268, 1, 8, 648447) Had it not been for Mr. Alibhai Akujis efforts and those of other leaders from Kanam 1, it would have been difficult to persuade the people from that area [to join the movement].
('8', 268, 1, 9, 648626) I know that Mr. Alibhai Akuji had wanted for some time to return to India, and also that he stayed behind especially because of the move ment.
('8', 268, 1, 10, 648769) I pray to God that Mr. Alibhai Akuji and Mr. Alibhai Mahomed may be blessed with long life and that they be enabled, too, to devote themselves to the service of the community and other good works.
('8', 268, 3, 11, 648966) In India the wound inflicted by a trident is believed to be very painful.
('8', 268, 3, 12, 649040) The Town Council here wants to strike the Indians with just such a weapon.
('8', 268, 3, 13, 649115) Despite the utter defeat it has suffered in the case against the Kaffirs of Sophiatown, it is shameless.
('8', 268, 3, 14, 649220) 2 There is a saying among us, however, that the shameless have no face 3 to lose and that appears to be the case with this Town Council.
('8', 268, 3, 15, 649357) Moreover, they say in English that a municipality has no soul; so how can a soulless thing have self respect or honour?
('8', 268, 3, 16, 649477) The Town Council proposes to approach the local Government with three demands [as under]:
('8', 268, 4, 17, 649567) the introduction of such measures as may secure the enforcement of regulations having the object of preventing Natives and Coloured persons from occupying premises in localities other than those approved by the Council; of prohibi ting the acquisition by lease, purchase or otherwise by Natives and Coloured persons of property in localities other than such as may be approved by the Council; and the regulation of the use of streets and sidewalks by Native.
('8', 268, 5, 18, 650026) I do not see any possibility of such powers being granted to the Town Council.
('8', 268, 5, 19, 650105) All the same, it is remarkable that the biggest Town Council in the Transvaal should in all seriousness entertain such a

('8', 269, 1, 3, 650496) We must not therefore lose sight of the Town Councils intentions in this regard.
('8', 269, 1, 4, 650577) If I say that such a law is impossible, it is because of the confi dence I have in our community.
('8', 269, 1, 5, 650675) A community which has only rec ently won a great victory, that is to say, which has conducted the satya graha movement over a period of 16 months, is not likely to shrink from battle.
('8', 269, 1, 6, 650859) Whatever, therefore, the intentions of the Johannesburg Town Council, they will only remain intentions.
('8', 269, 1, 7, 650963) A community which has the trident aimed at it had better be on the look out.
('8', 269, 1, 8, 651040) That is the path of wisdom for us, and success for us lies along that way.
('8', 269, 2, 9, 651115) LICENCE
('8', 269, 3, 10, 651123) By the time this article is in the hands of the readers, it will be the 19th or 20th.
('8', 269, 3, 11, 651209) Indians who have not by that date taken out trade licences will have only 11 days left.
('8', 269, 3, 12, 651297) I advise them with all the empha sis at my command to take out licences during that period.
('8', 269, 3, 13, 651389) I cannot assert that under no condition will a licence be issued after that date.
('8', 269, 3, 14, 651471) But it is our duty faithfully to carry out our part of the bargain.
('8', 269, 3, 15, 651539) It should be remembered that even those who have not taken out regis ters voluntarily will be entitled to licences which will be valid up to June 30.

('8', 269, 7, 19, 651767) PREFACE
('8', 269, 8, 20, 651775) During the days of the Transvaal campaign, we invited [entries for a prize] essay on the ethics of passive resistance.
('8', 269, 8, 21, 651894) The reader will recall that we had offered a prize of 10 for it.
('8', 269, 8, 22, 651959) There were only four competitorstwo whites and two Indians.
('8', 269, 8, 23, 652019) The decision as to who among them deserved the prize was left to Mr. Doke.
('8', 269, 8, 24, 652094) He did not know the names [of the competitors] when he read the essays.
('8', 269, 8, 25, 652166) He decided in favour of Mr. Maurice.
('8', 269, 8, 26, 652203) Accordingly, a sum of 10 has been sent to him.
('8', 269, 8, 27, 652250) We have not so far been able to publish the essay for want of space.
('8', 269, 8, 28, 652319) We do so now, since we have both the time and the space for it.
('8', 269, 8, 29, 652383) The reader can read the original essay in the English section.
('8', 269, 8, 30, 652446) Here, we

('8', 270, 1, 2, 652500) publish a translation.
('8', 270, 2, 3, 652523) We were a little disappointed that not many persons had come forward to write.
('8', 270, 2, 4, 652602) We do not think Mr. Maurices essay is a particularly impressive piece of writing, or that it has depth.
('8', 270, 2, 5, 652706) But his was undoubtedly the best of the four.
('8', 270, 2, 6, 652752) We can also say that it is on the whole a readable essay.
('8', 270, 2, 7, 652810) It should make us happy that we have found in South Africa an Indian who could write like that.
('8', 270, 2, 8, 652906) Being an Indian Christian, it is natural that Mr. Maurice should draw most of his illustrations from Christian sources.
('8', 270, 2, 9, 653026) We hope that a perusal of Mr. Maurices essay will stimulate greater interest in satyagraha among the people and make them more familiar with a campaign of this kind.

('8', 270, 4, 12, 653273) SOCRATESS DEFENCE
('8', 270, 5, 13, 653291) You will now understand why I have so many accusers.
('8', 270, 5, 14, 653344) I have been so busy bringing home to the people how ignorant we are and how very limited our knowledge is that I have taken no part in other public affairs.
('8', 270, 5, 15, 653501) I have neglected my own affairs and have remained very poor.
('8', 270, 5, 16, 653562) But I thought that I was serving God by opening the eyes of men totheir own ignorance.
('8', 270, 5, 17, 653649) It is because I chose to do this that people are enraged.
('8', 270, 5, 18, 653707) Some young men who have little work to do follow me about and imitate me in cross examining half baked persons.
('8', 270, 5, 19, 653819) The persons who are thus cross examined and exposed as frauds become angry with me.
('8', 270, 5, 20, 653903) Being unable to bring any other charge against me, they say that I look into things far too closely, that I disbelieve in the gods and make the worse appear the better reason.
('8', 270, 5, 21, 654079) Intent on covering up their own ignorance, they fill your ears with calumnies against me.
('8', 270, 5, 22, 654169) Such are Meletus and a few others.
('8', 270, 5, 23, 654204) Meletus says that I corrupt the youth of Athens.
('8', 270, 5, 24, 654253) I shall now examine Meletus himself.
('8', 270, 6, 25, 654290) SOCRATES: Meletus, do you not think that young men should be trained to be virtuous in every possible manner?
('8', 270, 7, 26, 654400) MELETUS: I do.
('8', 270, 7, 27, 654415) S: Who is it then who makes them virtuous?
('8', 270, 7, 28, 654458) M: The laws.
('8', 270, 8, 29, 654471) 1 Here follows the Gujarati translation of the essay.

('8', 271, 0, 1, 654566) 272 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 271, 1, 2, 654608) S: That is not the answer to my question.
('8', 271, 1, 3, 654650) What I asked was, Which man improves them? M: It is the judges who do so.
('8', 271, 1, 4, 654724) S: Do you mean to say that those who occupy the seats of justice are able to teach them virtue?
('8', 271, 1, 5, 654820) M: Certainly.
('8', 271, 1, 6, 654834) S: All of them?
('8', 271, 1, 7, 654850) Or only some of them?
('8', 271, 1, 8, 654872) M: All of them.
('8', 271, 1, 9, 654888) S: That is well said.
('8', 271, 1, 10, 654910) Now I ask you whether the listeners here can [also] improve the young or not.
('8', 271, 1, 11, 654988) M: They can, too.
('8', 271, 1, 12, 655006) S: You mean then that all the Athenians can instruct them in virtue while I alone corrupt them.
('8', 271, 1, 13, 655102) M: Most certainly, you do.
('8', 271, 1, 14, 655129) Yes, that is what I mean.
('8', 271, 1, 15, 655155) S: You have made a serious charge against me.
('8', 271, 1, 16, 655201) What you say probably holds good in the case of horses, too.
('8', 271, 1, 17, 655262) Will you say that one man does them harm and everyone else improves them?
('8', 271, 1, 18, 655336) On the con trary, is it not that only a very few are skilled in the art of training hor ses and the rest are ignorant?
('8', 271, 1, 19, 655455) Surely you will admit that the same rule applies in the case of other animals?
('8', 271, 1, 20, 655534) I think you cannot help doing so, for, of course, it does.
('8', 271, 1, 21, 655593) And in saying that the case stands differently with men, you have given no thought, as far as I can see, to your char ge against me.
('8', 271, 1, 22, 655726) Besides, wont you admit that those who spend much time in the company of bad persons come under their evil influence?
('8', 271, 1, 23, 655844) M: I must admit that it is true.
('8', 271, 1, 24, 655877) S: Would you then say that anyone would want to injure himself intentionally?
('8', 271, 1, 25, 655955) M: That I cannot say.
('8', 271, 1, 26, 655977) S: Now tell me, do I corrupt the young intentionally or unintentionally?
('8', 271, 1, 27, 656050) M: I say you corrupt them intentionally.
('8', 271, 1, 28, 656091) S: How can you say that?
('8', 271, 1, 29, 656116) You are young.

('8', 271, 1, 31, 656148) Do you really believe that I do not realize how, by corrupting others, I would myself become the worse for it?
('8', 271, 1, 32, 656259) You have yourself admitted that this is what would happen.
('8', 271, 1, 33, 656318) For we saw that those who keep company with the bad themselves become bad.

('8', 272, 1, 4, 656848) Now let us suppose that I corrupt them unintentionally.
('8', 272, 1, 5, 656904) In that case, it was your duty to show me how I did this.
('8', 272, 1, 6, 656962) You have not even tried to correct my error.
('8', 272, 1, 7, 657007) You would have nothing to do with me.
('8', 272, 1, 8, 657045) You only brought me up [here] for punishment.
('8', 272, 1, 9, 657091) 1 It is thus clear from what Meletus has said that he has never given the slightest thought to any serious matter.
('8', 272, 1, 10, 657206) Now let us consider how I corrupt the young.
('8', 272, 1, 11, 657251) Meletus, you say that I corrupt them by teaching them not to believe in the gods of the city?
('8', 272, 1, 12, 657345) M: Yes, most certainly, I mean that.
('8', 272, 1, 13, 657382) S: What do you imply by that?
('8', 272, 1, 14, 657412) Do I teach [them] to disbelieve in the gods of the city, or to believe in some other gods?
('8', 272, 1, 15, 657503) M: I mean that you do not believe in any gods at all.
('8', 272, 1, 16, 657557) S: Bravo Meletus!
('8', 272, 1, 17, 657575) You say that I believe neither the sun nor the moon to be a god, as the rest of the city does.
('8', 272, 1, 18, 657670) M: Yes, I do say that you believe the sun to be stone and the moon to be earth.
('8', 272, 1, 19, 657750) S: Who will believe you?
('8', 272, 1, 20, 657775) No one will believe your charge.
('8', 272, 1, 21, 657808) If I tried to teach any such thing, everyone would know that there was nothing new in that.
('8', 272, 1, 22, 657900) These are others idea.
('8', 272, 1, 23, 657923) 2 I myself do not believe in what they say.
('8', 272, 1, 24, 657967) However, since you accuse me thus about the sun and the moon, you will also say, I suppose, that I wholly disbelieve in the existence of God.
('8', 272, 1, 25, 658109) M: I do most certainly assert that you deny the existence of God.
('8', 272, 1, 26, 658175) S: You are then deliberately asserting something impossible.
('8', 272, 1, 27, 658236) How can I say that there is no God?
('8', 272, 1, 28, 658272) Can anyone assert the existence of mans attributes but deny the existence of man?
('8', 272, 1, 29, 658354) Or assert the existence of things pertaining to horses but deny the existence of horses?
('8', 272, 1, 30, 658443) Or assert the existence of things pertaining to angels but deny the existence of angels?
('8', 272, 1, 31, 658532) M: The existence of what pertains to a thing implies the existence of the thing itself S: You admit that I talk of things pertaining to gods; you must admit therefore that I grant the existence of gods.

('8', 273, 2, 3, 658948) Here are some of the facts about the Nationalist Party founded by Mustafa Kamal Pasha.
('8', 273, 2, 4, 659035) A huge meeting was held in December last, attended by about a thousand sympathizers, to found the Nationalist Party.
('8', 273, 2, 5, 659152) Of the reso lutions passed at the meeting, the first appointed Mustafa Kamal Pasha the leader of the party during his lifetime.
('8', 273, 2, 6, 659280) Provision was made for a meeting to be held within ten days of his death for the purpose of electing a new leader.
('8', 273, 2, 7, 659395) Also a congress of the members of the Nation alist Party was to be held annually, at which an executive committee was to be elected.
('8', 273, 2, 8, 659528) A sub committee of eight members elected from it was to meet weekly.
('8', 273, 2, 9, 659597) The Partys views have spread throughout the Nile valley thanks to newspapers and speeches.
('8', 273, 2, 10, 659688) The more well to do members of the Party have started schools at their own expense, which widely dissemi nate the partys principles.
('8', 273, 2, 11, 659821) The object of the Party is to secure the establishment of an Egyptian Parliament.
('8', 273, 2, 12, 659903) It will continue to hold a general congress every year till this object is achieved and will more over do all it can to enable the people to defend their rights and to advance themselves.
('8', 273, 2, 13, 660091) The British Government cannot stop the Nationalist Party because the party is wise enough not to encourage acts of violence.
('8', 273, 2, 14, 660216) Addressing a 6,000 strong meeting Mustafa Kamal Pasha decla red that his party would work to open the eyes of the Egyptian people to their present conditions, foster political consciousness in them and promote peace and unity between the two sections of Egyptian.
('8', 273, 2, 15, 660480) society.
('8', 273, 2, 16, 660489) The main object of the Nationalist Party was to see that the administration was entrusted to the peoples representatives, who would be responsible to a sovereign parliament constituted on the European model; also, Egypt should enjoy complete freedom (from British control) in its internal administration.

('8', 274, 2, 3, 660917) [JOHANNESBURG, Before April 25, 1908] THE HONBLE THE COLONIAL SECRETARY PRETORIA
('8', 274, 3, 4, 660998) SIR, I have been desired by the Committee of my Association to approach the Government regarding the Draft Gold Law which the Government intend to introduce during the forthcoming session of Parliament In the humble opinion of my Committee, the Draft [law] imposes on British Indians disabilities graver than those found in the existing law.
('8', 274, 3, 5, 661340) My Committee had hoped, as it still hopes, that the legal disabilities of the community represented by it would be lightened by the Government instead of their being increased.
('8', 274, 3, 6, 661517) My Committee desired me specifically to draw the attention of the Government to the following: 1. The Draft retains in the definition of the term Coloured per son the word coolie which, as applied to the present Indian population of the Colony, is an offensive term, there being in the Transvaal very few, if any, coolies in the proper sense of the term.
('8', 274, 3, 7, 661872) Moreover, the bracketing together African natives and Asiatics, British subjects and non British subject 2, is to ignore the peculiar position occupied by British Indian.
('8', 274, 3, 8, 662043) 2. The retention of the original law as to dealing in unwrou ght gold, in so far as it specially affects Coloured people besides their coming tinder the general prohibitions of the law, assumes that Colou red people are the greater offenders in respect of dealing in unwrou ght gold, whereas in the opinion of my Association the contrary is the fact in so far as British Indians are concerned.
('8', 274, 3, 9, 662437) 3. Moreover, the definition of unwrought gold probably pre vents Indian goldsmiths from carrying on their business of manufact uring jewellery even out of gold bars prepared in and imported from England.
('8', 274, 3, 10, 662641) This, it will be readily admitted, is a grievous hardship for the goldsmiths in question.

('8', 275, 1, 2, 662991) 4. Section 127 of the draft law is, it is submitted, rather vague and seems to contemplate entire prohibition of acquisition by Coloured people of any rights under it.
('8', 275, 1, 3, 663159) The prohibition, under the same section, to holders of rights acquired previous to the draft law, to transfer or sub let such right[s] to a Coloured person makes the law retrospective in its effect.
('8', 275, 1, 4, 663358) 5. Finally, section 128 which contemplates the compulsory segrega tion of Coloured people residing within proclaimed areas, would, if carried, make it impossible for a large majority of British Indians even to remain in the country.
('8', 275, 1, 5, 663591) In this connection, my Committee begs respectfully to remind the Government that my Association represents a people who claim to belong to a cultured stock in the human family, and trading and other interests which are sufficiently large to warrant the statement that the segregation of the Indian community means utter ruination to it from sheer inability to protect those interests in Bazaars, Locations or Com pounds.
('8', 275, 1, 6, 664012) My Com mittee further reminds the Government that the majority of British Indians domiciled in the Transvaal live within the mining areas.
('8', 275, 1, 7, 664151) My Committee therefore respectfully trusts that the clauses complained of will be with drawn by the Government or will be so amended as to give the desired relief to the British Indian com munity residing in the Transvaal.

('8', 275, 5, 12, 664523) On an earlier occasion we wrote about the Report 1 of the Natal Immigration Department.
('8', 275, 5, 13, 664611) We now have with us a copy of the full report.
('8', 275, 5, 14, 664658) As we read it, other thoughts occur to us.
('8', 275, 5, 15, 664701) Last year, Indians paid a sum of 2,666.1.0 to the Natal Treasury [as fees] for domicile certificates, etc.
('8', 275, 5, 16, 664808) Of this amount, 979.10.0 was for domicile passes, 631 for visiting passes and l,036 for embarkation passes.
('8', 275, 5, 17, 664916) In addition, 120 was forfeited for breach of the conditions under which visiting passes are issued.
('8', 275, 5, 18, 665016) Last year a large amount was collected in this manner from a small number of Indians.
('8', 275, 6, 19, 665102) 1 For a summary of the Report.

('8', 276, 1, 2, 665178) Most of thepasses cost 1 each.
('8', 276, 1, 3, 665209) We may therefore take it that this sum was realized from about 2,500 Indians.
('8', 276, 1, 4, 665287) What can we do to avoid such loss of money?
('8', 276, 1, 5, 665331) It is important that we ask ourselves this question and try to find a solution.
('8', 276, 1, 6, 665411) One way out is for Indians to be bold enough to disregard the laws and do without passes altogether.
('8', 276, 1, 7, 665512) This course is open only to those domiciled [in Natal].
('8', 276, 1, 8, 665568) What about those who want to come in for a temporary stay?
('8', 276, 1, 9, 665627) This question is rather more difficult to answer.
('8', 276, 1, 10, 665677) But human ingenuity can find a way out of any difficulty.
('8', 276, 1, 11, 665735) It is necessary to keep on at the Government about this subject.
('8', 276, 1, 12, 665800) The Government should be told that a large enough revenue accrues to it from the railways on account of the immigrants.
('8', 276, 1, 13, 665920) Next, businessmen may begin educating themselves as well as they can.
('8', 276, 1, 14, 665990) If they become conversant with the English language, they will gradually be able to spare themselves the expense discussed above.
('8', 276, 1, 15, 666120) And lastly, the practice of cheating the Government should be given up.
('8', 276, 1, 16, 666192) This last remedy is the most honest and efficacious.
('8', 276, 1, 17, 666245) The Report also reveals that 3,236 Asiatics were refused permission to land and compelled to return.
('8', 276, 1, 18, 666346) Not all of them had arrived by the sea route [from India].
('8', 276, 1, 19, 666405) Some of them came through the Transvaal.
('8', 276, 1, 20, 666446) Much money, therefore, must have been wasted in trying to enter the Transvaal.
('8', 276, 1, 21, 666525) The remedy for this state of affairs at any rate lies in our hands alone.
('8', 276, 1, 22, 666599) If we spend on education even a tenth of what we spend on questionable transactions, the prejudice that we find in South Africa against the black skin will disappear.

('8', 276, 3, 26, 666896) 1 We congra tulate the [Natal] Congress leaders for having moved in the matter and paid them a visit.
('8', 276, 3, 27, 666998) It is gratifying to learn that they are all well cared for and properly fed.
('8', 276, 3, 28, 667075) It is, however, regrettable that the poor men are being sent back to India.
('8', 276, 3, 29, 667151) We think it might have been possible to arrange for them to stay on in Natal if action had been taken earlier.
('8', 276, 3, 30, 667262) We can think of something that can still be done.
('8', 276, 3, 31, 667312) The Natal Government should be asked to state what arrangements it has made for these people when they arrive in India.
('8', 276, 3, 32, 667432) At the same time, a tele gram shouldbe sent to the South Africa British Indian Committee req

('8', 277, 3, 8, 668080) A heated controversy is raging among the Natal farmers over the question of ending immigration of indentured Indian labour.
('8', 277, 3, 9, 668204) The white farmers are agitated over the attitude of the Durban whites who are opposed to such immigration.
('8', 277, 3, 10, 668311) The farmers have passed a resolu tion at a conference which they held recently, saying that the supply of indentured Indian labour should not be stopped until Native labour becomes available.
('8', 277, 3, 11, 668503) Let us see what attitude the Natal Government will take up in this tug of war.
('8', 277, 3, 12, 668582) We must be on our guard and make sure that this contest between two buffaloes, that is, the Durban whites and the white farmers, does not uproot the Indian tree.
('8', 277, 4, 13, 668744) One of the farmers also argued at the conference that it was not the indentured labourers with whom the Durban whites were aggri eved.
('8', 277, 4, 14, 668879) They only wanted to stop the Indian trader, but they could not differentiate between the traders and indentured Indians.
('8', 277, 4, 15, 669000) These pro nouncements show that it is not because the white farmers are ena moured of Indian labourers that they prefer them.
('8', 277, 4, 16, 669126) Theirs is an attach ment arising only from self interest.
('8', 277, 4, 17, 669184) We should note that, in the pur suit of their common interests, the white traders and the white farmers will not hesitate to ruin the Indian trader.
('8', 277, 4, 18, 669333) By fighting the system of indenture, the Indian community will serve the Indian trader and ensure, at the same time, freedom from slavery for indentured labour ers.
('8', 277, 4, 19, 669498) We must not acquiesce in the coming of Indians to work as slaves.

('8', 278, 2, 3, 669773) Last week we wrote on the case in the Cape.
('8', 278, 2, 4, 669817) We have now received a full report of it, which we publish in the English section.
('8', 278, 2, 5, 669900) Another case, a more important one, under the Immigration Act, was also heard in the same Court.
('8', 278, 2, 6, 669997) In the first case the Court did not give its ruling on the point of law [that was raised].
('8', 278, 2, 7, 670088) In the second it did, and its judgment applies to all Indians in the Cape.
('8', 278, 2, 8, 670163) The following is a summary [of the case].
('8', 278, 2, 9, 670205) An Indian 2 was prohibited from disembarking and he moved the Supreme Court.
('8', 278, 2, 10, 670282) Under the Immigration Act of 1902, Indians domi ciled in South Africa were free to enter the Cape; this Indian came un der that category.
('8', 278, 2, 11, 670420) Under the Act of 1906, however, only those Indians who are domiciled in the Cape can settle there.
('8', 278, 2, 12, 670519) On the other hand, whites anywhere from South Africa are free [to enter].
('8', 278, 2, 13, 670593) But there is a loop hole in the Act of 1906, namely, that an Indian who leaves the Cape must if he is entitled to return, carry with him a pass for exit and re entry.
('8', 278, 2, 14, 670760) 3 It was the contention of the prosecution that the Indian in question had not taken out such a pass and had accordingly forfeited his right.
('8', 278, 2, 15, 670902) The contention was accepted by the Supreme Court.
('8', 278, 2, 16, 670952) While delivering the judgment, the Court expressed sympathy with the Indian and recommended that the Government deal with the case leniently for the reason that he had failed to take out the pass for re entry out of ignorance and that the lapse might therefore be condo ned.
('8', 278, 2, 17, 671227) 4 The consideration shown by the Court is to be welcomed.
('8', 278, 2, 18, 671285) How ever, what the Indian community wants is not leniency under an unjust law; the leniency should be incorporated in the law itself.
('8', 278, 2, 19, 671419) [No,] it is not even lenient laws that the community asks for; it will suffice if the laws are just.
('8', 278, 2, 20, 671520) It is imperative that the law should be amended.
('8', 278, 2, 21, 671569) It will be well if the Cape leaders take this stand and work accordingly.
('8', 278, 2, 22, 671643) We are sure that, if the leaders wrote to the South Africa British Indian Committee in England, they would receive excellent help.

('8', 279, 4, 7, 672448) The South African News has published a report of a meeting of the Cape Town British Indian League.
('8', 279, 4, 8, 672547) 1 We find someone has sent us a cutting for publication in the English [section].
('8', 279, 4, 9, 672629) We have decided not to publish it, for we do not see that its publication will be of any advantage to the community.
('8', 279, 4, 10, 672746) We know that the English section is read by a large number of decent whites.
('8', 279, 4, 11, 672823) That report is not likely to make a very good impression on their minds.
('8', 279, 4, 12, 672896) The headline under which the League report is published in The South African News says that it is not the journals own report, but was sent to it by someone and was being pub lished at his request.
('8', 279, 4, 13, 673094) The report deals with an attack [by the League] on the South Africa British Indian Association.
('8', 279, 4, 14, 673190) We have no knowledge of how the affairs of the Association are conducted, whether or not there is anything wrong with it.
('8', 279, 4, 15, 673312) The discussion at the League meeting may or may not have any basis in fact.
('8', 279, 4, 16, 673388) The point we wish to make is that by publicizing these matters in English journals we shall not promote the interests of the community but shall only create bad blood.
('8', 279, 4, 17, 673556) They also create a misleading impression in the minds of those who are prejudi ced against the Indians, and serve to strengthen their prejudice.
('8', 279, 4, 18, 673701) Indians have no time for bickering among themselves.
('8', 279, 4, 19, 673754) The task before the community is to fight its permanent enemy, and to bend all its energies to that end.
('8', 279, 4, 20, 673859) It is to be welcomed that the League has taken steps against the immigration law.
('8', 279, 4, 21, 673941) It is the Leagues duty to do all that needs to be do ne in this matter.
('8', 279, 4, 22, 674013) But in doing so it will not be proper for the League to make public attacks on the Association there or on other bodies.
('8', 279, 5, 23, 674134) 1 The meeting, held on April 12, was called to consider the complaints of some Kanamia Muslims who were dissatisfied with the affairs of the South Africa British Indian Association in the Cape.
('8', 279, 5, 24, 674328) The Association had asked that Urdu be recognized as the only language for the purposes of the Cape Immigration Act.
('8', 279, 5, 25, 674445) The League advocated the recognition of Urdu, Tamil, Bengali and Gujarati for this purpose.

('8', 280, 3, 5, 674745) The condition of Indians in Canada deserves notice.
('8', 280, 3, 6, 674797) There is no special legislation in that country designed to drive them out.
('8', 280, 3, 7, 674873) Most of the Indians there are Punjabis, who are all referred to as Sikhs 2. But from our experience here we can infer that it is unlikely that they should all be Sikhs.
('8', 280, 3, 8, 675042) Most of the Indians domiciled there are workers.
('8', 280, 3, 9, 675091) For the time being the authorities have resorted to some lacuna in the law to refuse admission to some [Indians] who came via Hong Kong, on the ground that they did not come directly from India.
('8', 280, 3, 10, 675286) 3 Canada has allowed Japanese to settle there, but is doing its utmost to keep Indians out.
('8', 280, 3, 11, 675378) What is the reason?
('8', 280, 3, 12, 675398) First, the Japanese settled in that cou ntry are brave people.
('8', 280, 3, 13, 675461) The whites who tried to intimidate them were beaten back.
('8', 280, 3, 14, 675519) 4 The Japanese moreover have an independent govern ment [at home] which protects its citizens interests.
('8', 280, 3, 15, 675624) Their Govern ment is free because the people have an independent disposition.
('8', 280, 3, 16, 675702) As against this, the Indians in Canada shut themselves up in their rooms when there was a riot in that country.
('8', 280, 3, 17, 675814) Also, India can do nothing effe ctive.
('8', 280, 3, 18, 675853) It has no government which can fight for the interests of the country [and its nationals abroad].
('8', 280, 3, 19, 675951) Indians are a subject people.
('8', 280, 4, 20, 675981) 1 Not reproduced here 2 Discussing the Indian immigrants in a newspaper article about the same time, Rudyard Kipling points out that they were mostly Sikhs, Muzbis and Jats from the Punjab who worked in the lumber mills and were found useful.
('8', 280, 4, 21, 676224) 3 On January 8, 146 Hindus, the majority of whom had arrived from the Orient by the steamer Monteagle, were ordered to be deported by an Order in Council of the Dominion Government because they had not come directly by continuous passage from the land of their birth.
('8', 280, 4, 22, 676492) They were, however, released on March 24 on writs of habeas corpus after the Supreme Court had pronounced their deportation altogether illegal.
('8', 280, 4, 23, 676636) 4 The Colonists objection was really to the Japanese who had monopolized the local fishing trade at Vancouver.
('8', 280, 4, 24, 676747) Again, Kipling says, When attacked, the Japanese defend themselves with asperity...The Indians are not understood of course; but they are not hated.... On this occasion the Japanese barricaded their quarters and flocked out, a broken bottle held by the neck in either hand which they jabbed in the faces of the demonstrators.
('8', 280, 4, 25, 677073) It is perhaps easier to haze and hammer bewildered Hindus and Tamils as is being done across the Border than to stampede the men of the Yalu .

('8', 281, 1, 2, 677258) reason for this state of affairs does not lie in British rule or the British flag.
('8', 281, 1, 3, 677341) We are the reason for that rule.
('8', 281, 1, 4, 677374) We do not, of course, see any advantage in bringing that rule to an end.
('8', 281, 1, 5, 677447) We can, however, change theways of the present Government.
('8', 281, 1, 6, 677506) We are the subjects of others because we do not have the spirit of independence.
('8', 281, 1, 7, 677587) If we can regain that spirit and then demand justice, we shall get it for the asking.
('8', 281, 1, 8, 677673) Among the numerous Indians in Canada, we do not find a single well educated person.
('8', 281, 1, 9, 677757) We must look upon these hardships caused by the movement against the Coloured persons in Canada and elsewhere as being beneficial [to us in the long run].
('8', 281, 1, 10, 677912) We are being trained [to resist injustice] and the eyes of the British are being opened.

('8', 281, 2, 12, 678043) 149. SIR HENRY CAMPBELL BANNERMAN
('8', 281, 3, 13, 678077) Newspapers have reported the death of Sir Henry Campbell Bannerman, one time Prime Minister of Britain.
('8', 281, 3, 14, 678181) Only a few days ago, we read the news of his resignation from office due to illness.
('8', 281, 3, 15, 678266) He never recovered from it.
('8', 281, 3, 16, 678294) Sir Henry was a prominent businessman in Glasgow.
('8', 281, 3, 17, 678344) But, while in business, he also educated himself.
('8', 281, 3, 18, 678394) Anxious to devote himself to public service instead of spending all his time in business, he entered politics.
('8', 281, 3, 19, 678505) Many Englishmen do this.
('8', 281, 3, 20, 678530) Mr. Chamberlain has been a businessman, and still is.
('8', 281, 3, 21, 678584) Sir Henry was a man of kind nature and noble mind.
('8', 281, 3, 22, 678635) His sympathies were not confined to his own people.
('8', 281, 3, 23, 678687) Wherever he saw oppression, his heart brimmed over with sympathy [for the victims].
('8', 281, 3, 24, 678771) Even while he held office as Prime Minister, he did not hesitate to express himself in strong terms in favour of the Russian people and against the Czar.
('8', 281, 3, 25, 678925) His policies have always been sound.
('8', 281, 3, 26, 678962) When he saw the Boers being wantonly attacked, he did not hesitate to declare himself against his own people.
('8', 281, 3, 27, 679072) He made a very strong speech at the time against the British soldiery.
('8', 281, 3, 28, 679143) Soon after he became Prime Minister, he granted self government to the Transvaal.
('8', 281, 3, 29, 679225) When the [Transvaal] Indian deputation visited England in con nection with the campaign against the law, he was very sympathetic [to the Indian case].
('8', 281, 3, 30, 679376) It is said that he had played some part in bringing pressure on Lord Elgin [to veto the Asiatic Law Amendment Ordin

('8', 282, 1, 2, 679538) 1Sir Henry was nearly seventy two.
('8', 282, 1, 3, 679573) Despite his age, he suffered from no weakness of body or mind.
('8', 282, 1, 4, 679636) Even at that ripe old age, he chose to continue in office and work for the public good.
('8', 282, 1, 5, 679724) We ought to learn from his example.
('8', 282, 1, 6, 679760) People in India do not enjoy such longevity, and even those who live long will not give their time for public service till the end.
('8', 282, 1, 7, 679892) We think we are old at forty; if meanwhile we have done anything worth while, we become conceited, and imagine that there is no more to be done, andspend the rest of our days in ease and luxury.
('8', 282, 1, 8, 680087) [If we looked around,] we would find hundreds of such instances yet we often express our resentment at not being granted self Govern ment.
('8', 282, 1, 9, 680226) When India comes to have hundreds of men like Sir Henry, she will gain her freedom in no time.
('8', 282, 1, 10, 680321) It will then matter little which flag flies over the palace.

('8', 282, 2, 12, 680424) 150. JOHANNESBURG LETTER
('8', 282, 3, 13, 680449) GOLD LAW
('8', 282, 4, 14, 680458) The following letter 2 about the Gold Law has been sent to the Colonial Secretary on behalf of the Association The draft Gold Law which is to be introduced during the forthcoming session of Parliament imposes on British Indians disabilities graver than those found in the existing law.
('8', 282, 4, 15, 680744) The Committee had hoped, as it still does, that the disabilities of the Indian community would be lightened [by the Government] instead of being increased.
('8', 282, 4, 16, 680900) My Committee draws the attention of the Government to the following.
('8', 282, 4, 17, 680969) In the draft [Law] the definition of the term Coloured person contains the word coolie which is offensive to the Indian community as there are in the Transvaal very few, if any, coolies in the proper sense of the word.
('8', 282, 4, 18, 681188) Moreover, to bracket together African Natives and Asiatics, British subjects and others who are not British subjects is to ignore the fact of Indians being British subjects.
('8', 282, 4, 19, 681362) The retention of the original law as to dealing in unwrou ght gold, in so far as it affects Coloured persons, not only brings them under the general prohibitions of the law, but assumes thatin dealings in unwrought gold Coloured persons are the

('8', 283, 0, 1, 681706) 284 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 283, 1, 2, 681748) greater offenders whereas in my Associations view the very opposite is the case [at least] in so far as British Indians are concerned.
('8', 283, 1, 3, 681883) Moreover, the definition of unwrought gold is likely to prove defective.
('8', 283, 1, 4, 681956) It will probably prevent Indian goldsmiths from carrying on their business of making jewellery even from gold bars made in and imported from England.
('8', 283, 1, 5, 682106) Section 127 of the draft Law is vague and would seem completely to bar acquisidon by Coloured persons of any rights whatever.
('8', 283, 1, 6, 682232) The section also prohibits holders of rights acquired previous to the draft law from transferring or sub letting such rights to a Coloured person.
('8', 283, 1, 7, 682379) A law should have effect from the date of the draft, but according to this section the draft law will be retroactive.
('8', 283, 1, 8, 682497) The last objection is to the provision in Section 128 for the removal of Coloured persons from the mining areas, proclai med as such, to Locations.
('8', 283, 1, 9, 682645) If carried, the section will make it impossible for a large majority of British Indians to continue in the country.
('8', 283, 1, 10, 682761) In this connection, my Association begs to remind the Government that the Indians are a cultured people, with tra ding and other interests sufficiently large to warrant the state ment that the segregation of the community in Locations will result in its utter ruin as it will be unable to protect those intere sts in Bazaars, Locations or Compounds.
('8', 283, 1, 11, 683111) My Association further reminds the Government that the majority of British Indians domiciled in the Transvaal live in mining areas.
('8', 283, 1, 12, 683243) My Association therefore trusts that the clauses complained of will be withdrawn by the Government or will be so amended as to give the desired relief to the British Indian community residing in the Transvaal.
('8', 283, 2, 13, 683453) WHAT IS VOLUNTARY [REGISTRATION]?
('8', 283, 3, 14, 683487) Some Indians are still in a quandary about voluntary and comp ulsory [registration], with the Permit Office adding to their confusion.
('8', 283, 3, 15, 683622) A correspondent informs us that officials insist on 18 digit impres sions.
('8', 283, 3, 16, 683697) My advice to everyone concerned is, Give them.
('8', 283, 3, 17, 683744) Since the giving of finger impressions is voluntary, I see nothing wrong in doing so.
('8', 283, 3, 18, 683830) But those whose objections are genuine need not.
('8', 283, 3, 19, 683879) They can still refuse.
('8', 283, 3, 20, 683902) When the giving of finger impressions was compulsory, anyone refusing to do so would have been liable to prosecution.
('8', 283, 3, 21, 684020) Now that it is voluntary, one need not be concerned if the official refuses toentertain ones application.
('8', 283, 3, 22, 684126) Those who object to the finger impres sions need not give them, regardless of what the officials say.
('8', 283, 3, 23, 684228) It is our
('8', 284, 0, 1, 684238) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 285
('8', 284, 1, 2, 684283) duty to apply for registration of our own accord.
('8', 284, 1, 3, 684333) If difficulties are created in the performance of that duty, we cannot then be brought within the scope of the law.
('8', 284, 1, 4, 684449) Only those who supply wrong information or those whose permits are not valid will have reason for fear.
('8', 284, 1, 5, 684553) The fear, moreover, will only be of being refused permits, for they will not be prosecuted.
('8', 284, 1, 6, 684645) The best course for anyone who objects to finger imp ressions is to refuse to give them and then inform the Secretary of the Association.
('8', 284, 1, 7, 684783) Having done so, he may set his mind at rest.
('8', 284, 1, 8, 684828) But he must not panic and go back to offer his finger impressions.
('8', 284, 1, 9, 684895) Only those who feel that the satyagraha campaign has transformed them from lambs into lions can lay claim to success.
('8', 284, 2, 10, 685013) ROODEPOORT CHAMBER
('8', 284, 3, 11, 685032) The Roodepoort Chamber [of Commerce] wants an end to the practice of Indians holding land in the names of whites.
('8', 284, 3, 12, 685146) Indians [it thinks] should be sent to Locations and the municipalities should have the power to refuse them licences.
('8', 284, 3, 13, 685264) The Chamber has addressed a long letter to General Smuts to place this demand before him.
('8', 284, 3, 14, 685354) The South African whites will allow Indians no rest.
('8', 284, 3, 15, 685407) They are bent on keeping us on our mettle all the time.
('8', 284, 3, 16, 685463) This, I think, is excellent training [for us].
('8', 284, 3, 17, 685510) We shall discover that, if we do not fear our enemy and do not show temper with him, he becomes our friend, for he then serves us like one.
('8', 284, 3, 18, 685650) Our vigilance will serve India well.
('8', 284, 3, 19, 685687) If we do become vigilant, that will be thanks to the likes of Roodepoort whites.
('8', 284, 4, 20, 685768) NEW ANTI INDIAN PARTY
('8', 284, 5, 21, 685790) A new party called the South Africa Forward Party has been formed in Johannesburg.
('8', 284, 5, 22, 685873) It has published its manifesto.
('8', 284, 5, 23, 685905) Its object is [to secure] the reservation of South Africa exclusively for white sett lers.
('8', 284, 5, 24, 685996) With that end in view, it has proposed the political and territorial segregation of Coloured persons.
('8', 284, 5, 25, 686098) It also wants that they should never be given the franchise, that their immigration into South Africa should be prohibited altogether and that those who are already there be pro gressively driven out.
('8', 284, 5, 26, 686299) There is no reason to expect that this party can achieve anything.
('8', 284, 5, 27, 686366) All the same, persons with such ideas carry on a campaign against Coloured persons.
('8', 284, 5, 28, 686450) We have to exert ourselves far more vigorously than they do if we are to retain our foothold in South Africa.
('8', 284, 6, 29, 686560) LIMIT OF SELFISHNESS
('8', 284, 7, 30, 686581) While on the one hand, the whites demand the expulsion of Ind ians from South Africa, on the other, they also want to exploit Indians as much as they can.
('8', 284, 7, 31, 686736) Mr. Wall, the Chief Engineer of Railways in the Transvaal, thinks that the Transvaal has a surplus of coal and suggests
('8', 285, 0, 1, 686856) 286 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 285, 1, 2, 686898) that it be dumped on India.
('8', 285, 1, 3, 686926) It does not occur to him that, if any such attempt is made, the Indians may want to put forward their own terms.
('8', 285, 1, 4, 687039) He assumes that Indians are cowards who can do nothing, as though they were born only to carry the burdens of others.
('8', 285, 2, 5, 687157) WICKED CIVILIZATION
('8', 285, 3, 6, 687177) Australia has recently furnished a wicked instance of the extreme selfishness that I mentioned earlier.
('8', 285, 3, 7, 687281) There, they are after the Chinese.
('8', 285, 3, 8, 687316) Chinese sometimes manage to stow away to Australia.
('8', 285, 3, 9, 687368) A ship is like a small settlement.
('8', 285, 3, 10, 687403) It is often difficult to find a person [hiding] in the hold.
('8', 285, 3, 11, 687464) To ensure that no one remains undetected, the Australian Government hasordered the hold of every steamer to be sulphurated so that the Chinese stow away is forced to come out or choke to death.
('8', 285, 3, 12, 687658) Several persons have already died in this manner.
('8', 285, 3, 13, 687708) The shameless and hard hearted officials, blinded by selfishness, instead of being moved to pity by these things, gloat over them and pat themselves on the ba ck for having so cleverly hunted out the Chinese.
('8', 285, 3, 14, 687917) If anyon esuggests that fumigation with sulphur be discontinued, it is not because they are anxious to save innocent lives, but because they are concerned at possible damage to the cargo.
('8', 285, 3, 15, 688105) How can we accept these things about the West as civilized?
('8', 285, 3, 16, 688165) Such incidents have set many whites thinking.
('8', 285, 3, 17, 688211) They ask themselves whether the western peoples are in fact more civilized than those in the East.
('8', 285, 3, 18, 688310) It is only right that they should ponder over this question.
('8', 285, 3, 19, 688371) We, on our part, ought to resist the fascination that western civilization has for us in view of these features that we observe.
('8', 285, 3, 20, 688500) At the same time we should remember that eastern peoples have not been free from comparable cruelty.
('8', 285, 3, 21, 688601) In fact, we find in the East exam ples of greater cruelty than in the West.
('8', 285, 3, 22, 688677) The only lesson to be learnt is that East and West are no more than names.
('8', 285, 3, 23, 688752) Human beings are the same everywhere.
('8', 285, 3, 24, 688790) 1 He who wants to will conduct himself with decency.
('8', 285, 3, 25, 688843) There is no people to whom the moral life is a special mission.
('8', 285, 3, 26, 688907) Every thing depends on the individual himself.
('8', 285, 3, 27, 688954) One can pursue the princi ples of morality at any place, in any environment or condition of life.
('8', 285, 4, 28, 689052) SIR PERCY FITZPATRICK 2
('8', 285, 5, 29, 689076) This gentleman is one of the leaders of the Progressive Party.
('8', 285, 5, 30, 689139) He has declared in a speech that, since South Africa is a preserve of the whites, Asiatics ought to be denied any share in it.
('8', 285, 5, 31, 689266) He would be hap pier still if something could be done about the Kaffirs too.
('8', 285, 5, 32, 689343) If we ask
('8', 285, 6, 33, 689353) 1 Literally, the chula is made of earth everywherea Gujarati saying.
('8', 285, 6, 34, 689422) 2 Sir James Percy Fitzpatrick (1862 1931); President, Witwatersrand Chamber of Mines; Member for Pretoria East in Union Parliament, 1910 20; author of several books on South Africa

('8', 286, 1, 2, 689648) him whether India, too, is a preserve of the whites, what will he have to say in reply?
('8', 286, 1, 3, 689736) Instead of asking Sir Percy this, however, if every Indian put that question to himself, all his difficulties would vanish in no time.
('8', 286, 1, 4, 689871) Last years campaign was calculated to test our mettle, and if we have stood the test, I have no doubt in my mind that we shall be able to live on [here] in freedom and with self respect, whatever Sir Percy may say.
('8', 286, 1, 5, 690086) But we can retain our freedom and self esteem only if we are in the right and speak the truth.
('8', 286, 1, 6, 690181) If our only anxiety is to see as many Indians as possible admitted into South Africa by fair means or foul, then good bye to self respect and honour!
('8', 286, 2, 7, 690331) BOYCOTT BY CHINESE
('8', 286, 3, 8, 690350) We gather from the newspapers here that the Chinese want to use the weapon of boycott against the Japanese.
('8', 286, 3, 9, 690458) It appears that Japanese officials tyrannize over the Chinese in Korea.
('8', 286, 3, 10, 690530) The Chinese feel that they are not strong enough for an armed encounter, but they know that Japan cannot stay on in Korea or anywhere in China except with their help.
('8', 286, 3, 11, 690697) Japan has a large trade with China, and that gives the Chin ese immense power.
('8', 286, 3, 12, 690776) Conscious of that power, they have decided to boycott Japanese goods if Japan does not behave, and have already proceeded to act on the decision.
('8', 286, 3, 13, 690922) This has frightened Japan.
('8', 286, 3, 14, 690949) Such is the power of boycott, and boycott is only one aspect of satyagraha.
('8', 286, 3, 15, 691025) If by itself it can be so much stronger than hundreds of guns, what may we not expect of satyagraha?
('8', 286, 3, 16, 691126) India, too, recently provided a fine exa mple of boycott.
('8', 286, 3, 17, 691184) The telegraph operators went on strike in despe ration and created a scare in one day.
('8', 286, 3, 18, 691271) Lord Minto sent telegraphic ins tructions that a compromise should be reached with the telegraph operators.
('8', 286, 3, 19, 691379) Some foolish persons suggested that white operators alone should be employed without realizing that thousands of men cannot thus be replaced at a moments notice.
('8', 286, 4, 20, 691541) DRIVING COLOURED PERSONS TO LOCATIONS: DISCUSSION
('8', 286, 5, 21, 691591) At the annual meeting of Het Volk, a Dutch society in the Trans vaal, General Smuts declared that a municipal Bill, which, he hoped, would solve the question of Coloured persons living among whites, would be introduced during the next session of Parliament.
('8', 286, 5, 22, 691849) He did not elaborate the point further.
('8', 286, 5, 23, 691889) The others, too, did not argue further about the question.
('8', 286, 5, 24, 691948) True satyagrahis need not be frightened at such moves; only, they must remain vigilant.
('8', 286, 5, 25, 692036) This should serve as a warning particularly to those who feel that satyagraha once has been enough.

('8', 287, 1, 2, 692220) 151. STORY OF A SOLDIER OF TRUTH [ IV]
('8', 287, 2, 3, 692259) I have nothing more to say about Meletuss charge.
('8', 287, 2, 4, 692309) I believe, moreover, that most of the people here are opposed to me.
('8', 287, 2, 5, 692378) You will condemn me not on the basis of what Meletus and others say, but because of the prejudice and suspicion of the multitude.
('8', 287, 2, 6, 692508) But many a good man has suffered in this way and many more will suffer thus in future.
('8', 287, 2, 7, 692595) Someone may well ask: Are you not ashamed, Socrates, of pursuing studies which are likely to lead to your death? I should answer such a man with perfect justice: You are wrong.
('8', 287, 2, 8, 692772) Even a man of slight worthmust be prepared for death.
('8', 287, 2, 9, 692826) He must think only of one thing when embarking on any course of action, namely, whether he is acting rightly or wrongly, whether the action is worthy of a good man or not, It as you imply, an act which involves the risk of death is a bad act, all the great warriors who fell in the battle at Troy, while doing their duty, must be deemed very bad men indeed.
('8', 287, 2, 10, 693184) Patroclus was warned by his mother that if he killed Hector, his own death would follow close upon Hectors.
('8', 287, 2, 11, 693292) 1 Patroclus replied that it was a thousand times to be preferred that he should die for killing Hector to that he should live on as a coward.
('8', 287, 2, 12, 693434) Patroclus was not frightened of death.
('8', 287, 2, 13, 693473) The right thing for a man is not to desert his post even if he has to run the risk of being killed or any other risk, whether he has chosen the post of his own will or has been put there by a superior.
('8', 287, 2, 14, 693675) Consider, moreover, that when I was in the service of this State, I remained at the post where my commander had placed me and ran the risk of death.
('8', 287, 2, 15, 693824) How strange would it be if, when my heart bade me seek a certain wisdom, I did not follow its bidding or failed to speak out for fear of death?
('8', 287, 2, 16, 693968) If I should fear death, that would be contrary to my belief that I am an ignorant man.
('8', 287, 2, 17, 694055) If I think myself wise, without being wise, I would certainly deserve to be brought to trial.
('8', 287, 2, 18, 694149) To fear death is to presume knowledge.
('8', 287, 2, 19, 694188) For who has discovered for certain that death is a thing to be afraid of?Why should we not believe that death is the greatest good that can happen to men?
('8', 287, 2, 20, 694343) Men fear it as though they knew very well that it was the greatest of evils!
('8', 287, 2, 21, 694420) What greater ignorance can there be than this of assuming that we know what we do not know ?
('8', 287, 2, 22, 694513) On these matters I think differently from others.
('8', 287, 2, 23, 694563) If I have any wisdom, it is this: I claim to know nothing about
('8', 287, 3, 24, 694627) 1 The warning was given not to Patroclus, but to his comrade, who was eager to kill Hector and avenge the death of Patroclus.

('8', 288, 1, 2, 694798) and therefore make no attempt to conceal my ignorance.
('8', 288, 1, 3, 694853) But I do well know that it is evil to do wrong and to disobey my superior.
('8', 288, 1, 4, 694928) I will therefore never shrink in fear from what I hold to be right.
('8', 288, 1, 5, 694996) If you were, therefore, to say to me without listening to my accusers argu ment, Socrates, this time we will spare you, but on the condition that you cease this quest of yours; if you are found engaged in these pur suits again, you shall die, I should say in reply, Athenians, I hold you in the highest regard and love; but I will obey God rather than you.
('8', 288, 1, 6, 695353) As long as I have breath and strength, I will not give up philosophy, or exhorting everyone I meet and those who would listen to me, saying,O excellent Athenians!
('8', 288, 1, 7, 695516) You are citizens of famous city.
('8', 288, 1, 8, 695549) You are known to be men of strength and wisdom.
('8', 288, 1, 9, 695597) Yet you are so keen on making money that you give little thought to the means you employ for the purpose.
('8', 288, 1, 10, 695703) You are eager for positions of honour and for reputation.
('8', 288, 1, 11, 695761) Are you not ashamed of these things?
('8', 288, 1, 12, 695798) You show little concern for your soul, for wisdom and truth.
('8', 288, 1, 13, 695859) You take no thought for the perfection of your soul. It in reply, someone were to say that he did care for his soul and sought truth, I would not let it go at that.
('8', 288, 1, 14, 696024) I would ask him in what way he cared for all these things.
('8', 288, 1, 15, 696083) I would test him before I let him go.
('8', 288, 1, 16, 696121) If in the course of the enquiry I found that he had no truth in him, I would reproach him with setting the lower value on the more important things and the higher value on those that are of less account.
('8', 288, 1, 17, 696325) This I should do with everyonecitizen or stran ger, young or oldbut more especially with you, since I am better known among you and more nearly akin to you.
('8', 288, 1, 18, 696482) Be assured that it is the command of God that I should speak thus.
('8', 288, 1, 19, 696549) I even go so far as to claim that the commands of God are very dear to me and that this fact is in itself conducive to the highest good of the city.
('8', 288, 1, 20, 696698) 1 I have only one interest To all, the young and the old, I say only one thing, namely, that you should care less for wealth and more for the soul; that you should strive for As perfection Virtue does not come from wealth, but wealth, and all other things of this world, will come to you if you have virtue.
('8', 288, 1, 21, 697006) If anyone says that I corrupt the people of this city by teaching them this, it would mean that virtue is vice.
('8', 288, 1, 22, 697118) But if any man says that I teach anything else, he is trying to mislead you. [From Gujarati] Indian Opinion, 25 4 1908

('8', 289, 1, 2, 697405) 152. LICENCES IN NATAL
('8', 289, 2, 3, 697428) Indian traders have been debating on what to do about the Natal Dealers [Licenses] Act.
('8', 289, 2, 4, 697516) Everyone agrees that something must be done.
('8', 289, 2, 5, 697561) Everyone believes that, if effective action is not taken, the Indian trader will lose his foothold in Natal.
('8', 289, 2, 6, 697670) The whites are out to ruin the Indians.
('8', 289, 2, 7, 697710) They want gradually to eliminate the Indians altogether.
('8', 289, 2, 8, 697767) All the Indians know this.
('8', 289, 2, 9, 697794) They ought to, at any rate.
('8', 289, 2, 10, 697822) It is more difficult however, to devise a remedy.
('8', 289, 2, 11, 697872) We can think of only one.
('8', 289, 2, 12, 697898) All the misfortunes of the Indian community are due primarily to the fact that the community has ceased to be respected.
('8', 289, 2, 13, 698019) It is neces sary for it to act with courage; only then will it command the respect of the Government.
('8', 289, 2, 14, 698121) What is to be done?
('8', 289, 2, 15, 698141) Two courses are open to the Indians.
('8', 289, 2, 16, 698178) One is to fight with the sword.
('8', 289, 2, 17, 698210) Our sword of steel has lost its edgethrough rust.
('8', 289, 2, 18, 698260) It is well that it should ever remain so.
('8', 289, 2, 19, 698302) For that which is gained by the sword can be retained only by the sword.
('8', 289, 2, 20, 698375) 1 The other course is to fight with the sword of Satyagraha.
('8', 289, 2, 21, 698436) This sword never rusts.
('8', 289, 2, 22, 698460) There is no need of a whetstone to sharpen it.
('8', 289, 2, 23, 698507) It is whetted with our hearts and burnished bright.
('8', 289, 2, 24, 698559) To be tempered it does not need to be heated.
('8', 289, 2, 25, 698605) It acquires its finish when tempered in the fire of trutha finish so perfect that it is never lost and the sword shines the brighter the longer it is used.
('8', 289, 2, 26, 698761) To fight with that sword is the second course the right one.
('8', 289, 2, 27, 698822) How to set about it?
('8', 289, 2, 28, 698843) It is easily done.
('8', 289, 2, 29, 698862) When even a single trader, who has the right to a licence is refused it, all the others should stand by him, refuse to accept licences and tell the Government so, proclai ming this refusal from the roof tops.
('8', 289, 2, 30, 699071) All traders must take an oath that they will swim or sink together.
('8', 289, 2, 31, 699139) If this is done, we make bold to say that the Dealers [Licenses] Act will be repealed, or suitably amended.
('8', 289, 2, 32, 699247) We attach the greatest importance to the Estcourt case.
('8', 289, 2, 33, 699303) 2 There is a similar case at Stanger against Mr. Kazi.
('8', 289, 2, 34, 699358) 3 These cases, we feel, can be made the test cases for the entire movement, but then sacrifices will be necessary.

('8', 290, 3, 11, 700376) We are glad of this.
('8', 290, 3, 12, 700397) At the same time, we must warn parents that it is no good making every Indian a bar at law or a lawyer.
('8', 290, 3, 13, 700501) There are many other profes sions, and young Indians must train for these too.

('8', 290, 5, 21, 700973) Delagoa Bay Indians need to be vigilant.

('8', 290, 5, 23, 701080) There should be a public body in Delagoa Bay to take up such questions.

('8', 290, 8, 27, 701255) This saying has a striking relevance to Indians.
('8', 290, 8, 28, 701304) At the meeting of one of the Chambers it was proposed that Indians should be made to leave South Africa and be sent away to those parts of East Africa which are unsuitable for the whites to settle in.
('8', 290, 8, 29, 701505) After some fruitless discussion, the matter was dropped.

('8', 291, 1, 3, 701767) Even in England newspapers are being misled by these ideas.
('8', 291, 1, 4, 701827) We ought to explain [the matter] properly to them.
('8', 291, 1, 5, 701878) I observe that Mr. Ritch is doing his best not to let such views, when they are published in newspapers, go unchallenged.
('8', 291, 3, 6, 702000) An Indian resident of Durban points out that the accounts of the British Indian Association show a sum of 50 as [contribution] from Natal, and that this may be interpreted by an outsider to mean that Natal had contributed 50 only.
('8', 291, 3, 7, 702231) This will bring Natal discredit.
('8', 291, 3, 8, 702264) He draws attention to the fact that Natal sent the British Indian Committee more than 250, and that this should be noticed [in the accounts].
('8', 291, 3, 9, 702406) This is correct.
('8', 291, 3, 10, 702423) Even for the Satyagraha campaign, Natals contribu tion has been invaluable.
('8', 291, 3, 11, 702499) How can one forget that, besides the amou nts remitted to the Committee, it spent money like water on telegrams and other things?
('8', 291, 4, 12, 702629) REGISTRATION
('8', 291, 5, 13, 702642) Voluntary registration continues.
('8', 291, 5, 14, 702676) There has been some diffi culty at Krugersdorp and Standerton.
('8', 291, 5, 15, 702739) In these towns the authorities have demanded ten finger impressions, and this has annoyed people.
('8', 291, 5, 16, 702837) There is no reason to be annoyed.
('8', 291, 5, 17, 702871) Anyone who wants to can claim exemption from the ten finger impressions after stating his reasons.
('8', 291, 5, 18, 702970) He cannot get into trouble for that, and he may therefore rest secure on that account.
('8', 291, 5, 19, 703057) But no one should imagine, on the other hand, that he can avoid giving the ten impressions without reason.
('8', 291, 5, 20, 703164) He must state the reason, such as religious scruple or [his right to] exemption on grounds of education or status.
('8', 291, 5, 21, 703279) There are others who are reluctant to give even the thumb impressions.
('8', 291, 5, 22, 703350) This is improper.
('8', 291, 5, 23, 703368) I think the thumb impressions must be given, if demanded.
('8', 291, 5, 24, 703426) I, however, advise those who have raised a sincere objection against the ten impressions to remain firm.
('8', 291, 6, 25, 703531) WHITE HAWKERS RIGHT
('8', 291, 7, 26, 703551) A white hawker was making his rounds in the Germiston Location, which is where he lives.
('8', 291, 7, 27, 703640) According to a by law in force in Germiston, no white can live in the Location or do business in it as a hawker.
('8', 291, 7, 28, 703753) He challenged this by law and the case went to a court.
('8', 291, 7, 29, 703809) The Magistrate fined him.
('8', 291, 7, 30, 703835) An appeal was then preferred in the Supreme Court which ruled that the municipality was authorized to make such a

('8', 292, 1, 3, 704043) This is an important decision.

('8', 292, 3, 17, 704965) You imagine that thesethings will be a great punishment for me.
('8', 292, 3, 18, 705029) But I do not think of them as such.
('8', 292, 3, 19, 705065) Rather, a person who tries to put another to death unjustly only harms himself.
('8', 292, 3, 20, 705145) Do not therefore feel that I am arguing in my defence.
('8', 292, 3, 21, 705200) I stand here to tell you what is in your own interest.
('8', 292, 3, 22, 705255) I want to save you from the wrong of violating the divine command.
('8', 292, 3, 23, 705322) If you put me to death, you will not easily find another man to fill my place.
('8', 292, 3, 24, 705401) It is, of course, not for me to say this, but I cannot help pointing it out.
('8', 292, 3, 25, 705478) As a strong horse needs reins, you need rein reins.
('8', 292, 3, 26, 705530) 1 Since you are also strong, I think it is the will of God that I should serve as your reins, and if you take my advice, you will spare me.
('8', 292, 3, 27, 705670) But it is likely that you will thoughtlessly order my death, being vexed with me as one sleeping is vexed with another who wakes him from his sleep and rushes at him ready to strike.
('8', 292, 3, 28, 705853) And then you will drop off to sleep again, unless you have another man to fill my place.
('8', 292, 3, 29, 705942) I strive for your good, having been sent by God for that purpose.
('8', 292, 3, 30, 706008) You can see that I have neglected my own affairs, busying myself uncea singly for your good, counselling each one of you like a father or an elder brother and striving to lead you along the right path.
('8', 292, 3, 31, 706210) You would have had some reason to doubt me if I had asked to be paid for what I was doing or made money thereby.
('8', 292, 3, 32, 706323) But my accusers have not charged
('8', 292, 4, 33, 706356) 1 An English translation uses a different simile.
('8', 292, 4, 34, 706406) Athens is compared to a sluggish horse which needs to be aroused by a gad fly and, Socrates says, I think I am the gad fly that God has sent to the city to arouse it.

('8', 293, 1, 2, 706615) me with demanding money.
('8', 293, 1, 3, 706640) And I have, in my poverty, the most con vincing evidence that I have not accepted or demanded any payment of money.
('8', 293, 1, 4, 706756) Perhaps you will ask me, why, if I go on exhorting people to virtue, moving from house to house, I do not take part in the political affairs of the city and strive for its welfare.
('8', 293, 1, 5, 706937) I have often given my reason for that.
('8', 293, 1, 6, 706976) I think I hear a divine voice whispering into my ear, telling me not to take part in politics.
('8', 293, 1, 7, 707071) And I think it well that this has been so.
('8', 293, 1, 8, 707114) If I had attempted to take part in politics, I should have perished long ago, without doing either you or myself any good.
('8', 293, 1, 9, 707237) Do not be angry with me for speaking the truth.
('8', 293, 1, 10, 707285) No man would be free from danger to his life, if he opposed the misrule prevailing in the city and tried to prevent injustice.
('8', 293, 1, 11, 707412) He who would approach every question from the standpoint of justice had better stay out of the bother and bustle of politics.
('8', 293, 1, 12, 707538) Let me give examples to prove this.
('8', 293, 1, 13, 707574) You will see then that even the fear of death cannot force me to do what I consider to be wrong.
('8', 293, 1, 14, 707671) But you will also see from them that, if I had busied myself in political affairs, I would have perished long ago.
('8', 293, 1, 15, 707786) You may perhaps find that what I am about to tell you interests you but little.
('8', 293, 1, 16, 707866) Nevertheless, it istrue.
('8', 293, 1, 17, 707891) I was at one time a member of our Assembly.
('8', 293, 1, 18, 707935) 1 It happened once that you resolved to sentenceten generals to death.
('8', 293, 1, 19, 708006) I alone of all the member 2 opposed the proposal.
('8', 293, 1, 20, 708056) All of you then cried out for my death.
('8', 293, 1, 21, 708096) But I stood firm; I thought that I ought to face death or imprisonment rather than join you in your unjust proposal.
('8', 293, 1, 22, 708213) This happened in the days of democracy.
('8', 293, 1, 23, 708253) When democracy had yielded place to oligarchy in this city, a person named Lyson 3 was ordered to be brought over, so that he could be put to death as sentenced.
('8', 293, 1, 24, 708415) I was among those who received this order.
('8', 293, 1, 25, 708458) I Knew that the sentence of death against Lyson had been pas sed unjustly.
('8', 293, 1, 26, 708533) 4 I ran the risk of death if I refused to go and bring him over.
('8', 293, 1, 27, 708598) I did not fear death; I refused to go.
('8', 293, 1, 28, 708637) If that Government had not been overthrown soon afterward, 5 I would certainly have been put to death.
('8', 293, 1, 29, 708740) You will now see that if I had taken part in public affairs and

('8', 293, 2, 33, 708933) 4 This incident, which marked the beginning of Platos disillusionment, is discussed in his Seventh Letter.

('8', 294, 1, 2, 709187) had always upheld the cause of justice, (Justice being the breath of my life, I could not have done otherwise.) I could not have remained alive all these years.
('8', 294, 1, 3, 709348) Throughout my whole life I have done no one an in justice, in private or in public; I have never acted in violation of jus tice.
('8', 294, 1, 4, 709477) I have never presumed to be a teacher.
('8', 294, 1, 5, 709516) But I never refused to ans wer anyones questions, if he sought me out to learn from me.
('8', 294, 1, 6, 709604) More over, I pay the same attention to the questions of both the poor and the rich, answering each one to the best of my ability.
('8', 294, 1, 7, 709734) If, in spite of this, anyone has failed to learn goodness from my words, I am not to be blamed.
('8', 294, 1, 8, 709830) If anyone among you asserts that I taught one thing to one man and something else to another, be sure he does not speak the truth.
('8', 294, 1, 9, 709961) It has been asked why so many persons want to spend their time in my company; you know the reason why.
('8', 294, 1, 10, 710064) If there are persons who think that they are wise while they are not, other persons delight to hear them cross examined.
('8', 294, 1, 11, 710185) It is certainly very amusing to listen to that.
('8', 294, 1, 12, 710233) I think it is a duty enjoined upon me by a god that I should examine people.
('8', 294, 1, 13, 710310) I have done nothing wrong thereby.
('8', 294, 1, 14, 710345) If it is true that Ihave corrupted the young by my teaching, those of them who are now grown up and are in a position to understand their true interests would have come forward to accuse me in your presence.
('8', 294, 1, 15, 710553) Or even if they did not do so, their kinsmen would have come forward to do so.
('8', 294, 1, 16, 710632) I see some of these young men and their kinsmen here in this assembly.
('8', 294, 1, 17, 710703) Why has Meletus not called any of them as witnesses?
('8', 294, 1, 18, 710756) If heand my other accusers have forgotten to summon them, I would permit them to do so even now.
('8', 294, 1, 19, 710853) Let their evidence be taken.
('8', 294, 1, 20, 710882) Instead of deposing against me, they will testify that their children have benefited by my company.
('8', 294, 1, 21, 710982) They will have no reason, save a love of justice, to speak in my favour, and they have nothing to gain by so doing.
('8', 294, 1, 22, 711098) I have said most of what I had to say in my defence.
('8', 294, 1, 23, 711151) It generally happens that the relatives of the accused come to the Court and entreat the judges for mercy, and the prisoner himself sheds tears.
('8', 294, 1, 24, 711296) I have done none of these things, neither have I any intention of doing them.
('8', 294, 1, 25, 711374) This again will perhaps make some of you angry.
('8', 294, 1, 26, 711422) I have kinsmen too.
('8', 294, 1, 27, 711442) I have three sonsone of them is grown up and the other two are still small.
('8', 294, 1, 28, 711518) But I do not want to bring any of them before you.
('8', 294, 1, 29, 711569) If I refrain from doing so, it is not because I mean to slight you.
('8', 294, 1, 30, 711637) Do not impute it to my arrogance either.
('8', 294, 1, 31, 711678) Let us [also] put on one side the fact that I have no fear of death.
('8', 294, 1, 32, 711747) But I think it would be a discredit to me, and to you, if, at this age and with my reputation, such as it is, I had my kinsmen to shed tears before you.
('8', 294, 1, 33, 711900) It would be unworthy of me.
('8', 294, 1, 34, 711928) Everyone admits that in some way Socrates is different from the mass of mankind.
('8', 294, 1, 35, 712009) If there should be among you any persons who
('8', 295, 0, 1, 712054) 296 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 295, 1, 2, 712096) excel the others and if they were to be prosecuted as I am being prosecuted, it would be shameful of them, from fear of death, to make anyone cry before you.
('8', 295, 1, 3, 712254) If death were a misfortune, or if it were true that having once escaped death one would become immortal, an appeal to the sentiments of pity through ones relatives could possibly be justified.
('8', 295, 1, 4, 712447) When our eminent men, although virtuous, begin to entertain such fear of death, foreigners are bound to scoff at us.
('8', 295, 1, 5, 712564) They will say: Even those Athenians who are chosen for high office because of their superior virtue behave no better than women.
('8', 295, 1, 6, 712693) How poor in spirit then must the other Athenians be! I believe therefore that no good man should enact such a farce.
('8', 295, 1, 7, 712810) If anyone attempts it, you ought to disallow it for the sake of the citys reputation.
('8', 295, 1, 8, 712896) Whatever your sentence, it is the duty of the persons concerned to endure it in patience.
('8', 295, 1, 9, 712986) And your duty is to despise those who give way to such pitiful melodrama.
('8', 295, 1, 10, 713060) But, leaving aside all talk of credit or discredit, I do not think it is proper for the accused to plead for mercy.
('8', 295, 1, 11, 713176) His duty is to ask for justice and to do so by stating facts and arguing from them.
('8', 295, 1, 12, 713260) The duty of the judge is not to show favour but to dispense justice impartially.
('8', 295, 1, 13, 713341) And therefore it behoves you and us that we should none of us forswear ourselves.
('8', 295, 1, 14, 713423) If I were to entreat you to break your oath, it would amount to proving Meletuss charge against me, namely, that I do not believe in God.
('8', 295, 1, 15, 713561) If anyone who believes in God teaches someone to violate his oath, then that will amount to teaching him to disobey God.
('8', 295, 1, 16, 713682) Such a person does not believe in God.
('8', 295, 1, 17, 713721) But I believe in God more firmly than anyone among you isever likely to, and therefore, trusting in Him, I leave my case in your hands without fear. [From Gujarati] Indian Opinion, 2 5 1908
('8', 295, 2, 18, 713911) 157. NATAL BILLS
('8', 295, 3, 19, 713928) The Indian Bills foreshadowed by the Colonial Secretary are now a gazetted fact, and, if the Bills go through, after the 30th June, 1911, there should be no more indentured Indians introduced into Natal.
('8', 295, 3, 20, 714132) The second Bill will put a stop to any new Indian or Arab licences after the 31st December, 1908. The third Bill provides for the total extinction of Indian licences after 10 years, subject to compensation being paid to the extent of three years purchase on the profits of the business.
('8', 295, 3, 21, 714419) The first Bill will be welcomed by every Indian in the Colony,
('8', 296, 0, 1, 714482) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 297
('8', 296, 1, 2, 714527) and we trust that it will pass the two Houses unanimously.
('8', 296, 1, 3, 714586) The pity is that indenture cannot be stopped even earlier.
('8', 296, 1, 4, 714645) The other two Bills will spread consternation amongst Indian traders.
('8', 296, 1, 5, 714715) The Bills are as ignorant as they are tyrannical.
('8', 296, 1, 6, 714765) Those who are responsible for drafting them still talk of Indians or Arabs, forgetting that there are no Arabs in Natal who are not also Indians, and that the term Arab is an exploded myth, so far as the Indians are concerned.
('8', 296, 1, 7, 714992) If the first of these two Bills becomes law and receives the Royal sanction, it does not require a particularly shrewd man to see that the second Bill is not even necessary.
('8', 296, 1, 8, 715166) In ten years time, there will be no Indian traders to compensate; for, we fancy that new trading licences include transfer from one person to another, as also from one place to another.
('8', 296, 1, 9, 715352) What are Indians, who are born traders, who have been traders before, butwho are today either in partnership with some other Indians or in the service of such Indians, to do ?
('8', 296, 1, 10, 715528) Why should they not receive trading licences in common with other Indians?
('8', 296, 1, 11, 715603) Why should the mere fact of one Indian having taken out a trading licence and another serving him and, in fact, carrying on the trade, prevent that other from doing an independent business?
('8', 296, 1, 12, 715793) And, in ten years time, is there to be no Indian trader to trade even among Indians ?
('8', 296, 1, 13, 715879) We do not advocate an indiscri minate issue of licences, but we do maintain that those who are traders by instinct should have every facility given to them for carrying on their trade; and that is the only way in which any country can take the best out of its inhabitants.
('8', 296, 1, 14, 716152) To many Indians, there are only two cou rses openhonest trade or dishonesty and fraud.
('8', 296, 1, 15, 716239) Surely the Natal Ministers do not wish to manufacture fraud and dishonesty in the Col ony.
('8', 296, 1, 16, 716330) Moreover, we think that they are mistaken if they consider that the Indian community will have nothing to say in the matter, or that it will allow itself to be extinguished without making a supreme effort.

('8', 296, 3, 19, 716606) The period for voluntary registration of Asiatics in the Transvaal closes today 1. Roughly speaking, almost every Asiatic has applied for voluntary registration; in other words, he has allowed himself to be identified afresh.
('8', 296, 3, 20, 716832) of the eight thousand odd applications made, six thousand have already been approved and passed.
('8', 296, 3, 21, 716929) This is a creditable record on either side.
('8', 296, 3, 22, 716973) The Asiatics have, therefore, fulfilled their

('8', 297, 1, 2, 717115) obligation, both in the spirit and the letter.
('8', 297, 1, 3, 717162) It now remains for the Government to complete the performance of its duty, namely, to repeal the Asiatic Act, and to legalize voluntary registration in a manner acceptable to the Asiatics and satisfactory from the Colonial standpoint, which is to restrict the authorized influx of new comers.
('8', 297, 1, 4, 717455) Tile Colonial principle has been accepted by the Indian community.
('8', 297, 1, 5, 717522) There need, therefore, be no further cause for friction.

('8', 297, 4, 8, 717627) Dr. Gubbins has been as good as his word.
('8', 297, 4, 9, 717669) Three Bills have been published in the Government Gazette.
('8', 297, 4, 10, 717728) One of them seeks to prohibit the importation of indentured Indian labour after June 30, 1911. This should be welcomed by every Indian.
('8', 297, 4, 11, 717864) There is not much difference between indenture and slavery.
('8', 297, 4, 12, 717924) We think it is far better that Indians do not come here at all than that they should come under these conditions.
('8', 297, 4, 13, 718038) The other two Bills are directed against the Indian trader.
('8', 297, 4, 14, 718098) Accor ding to one of them, no Indian businessman will get a new licence next year onward and, according to the other, an Indian will not get a licence at all after ten years.
('8', 297, 4, 15, 718273) After ten years, Indians who are still here will receive compensation to the extent of three years profits.
('8', 297, 4, 16, 718381) The first of the two Bills is really the more objectionable, for it means that, beginning from next year, no Indian can sell his busi ness to another or shift his shop.
('8', 297, 4, 17, 718550) That being the case, how many Ind ians will be left here after ten years to claim compensation?
('8', 297, 4, 18, 718646) Moreover, payingthree years profits as compensation is paying no compen sation at all.
('8', 297, 4, 19, 718733) The Indians business will be ruined, and he will be swept out of existence.
('8', 297, 4, 20, 718809) Bills of this kind are unlikely to go through.
('8', 297, 4, 21, 718856) But one must not rest complacent on this assumption.
('8', 297, 4, 22, 718909) It is essential to try and bring pressure on the Natal Government so that it does not even entertain such proposals.
('8', 297, 4, 23, 719026) We have already mentioned the remedies, 1 and later we shall have more to say about them.
('8', 297, 4, 24, 719116) It is imperative that every Indian should be extremely vigilant.

('8', 298, 3, 7, 719541) India, it would appear, is in turmoil these days.
('8', 298, 3, 8, 719591) We learn from the cablegrams which we have translated that there has been a revolt of no small magnitude in the [North west] Frontier [Province].
('8', 298, 3, 9, 719737) It appe ars, 20,000 Afghans have taken the field.
('8', 298, 3, 10, 719787) At the same time, the unrestis spreading all over India.
('8', 298, 3, 11, 719844) A white woman was killed by an explosion.
('8', 298, 3, 12, 719886) The cablegram suggests that the intention [of the assailant] was to kill a magistrate But an error on his part led to the death of an innocent woman.
('8', 298, 4, 13, 720036) That two persons should have been killed is a horrifying thought, but it is nothing extraordinary in Indias history.
('8', 298, 4, 14, 720153) Rather, it is the lesson to be drawn from this incident that is frightening.
('8', 298, 4, 15, 720230) We have no reason to rejoice at the introduction of Russian methods in India.
('8', 298, 4, 16, 720308) The Indian people will not win their freedom through these methods.
('8', 298, 4, 17, 720376) We have no reason to believe that what is effective in Russia will be efficacious for India too.
('8', 298, 4, 18, 720473) It is likely that these incidents will distract people from their duty; the easy and straightforward methods of campaigning for ones rights will be gradually eschewed and, in the end, the methods which we imagine wewould use only against foreigners will be used against ourselves.
('8', 298, 4, 19, 720754) This has ever been so.
('8', 298, 4, 20, 720777) There is therefore not the slightest reason for Indians to gloat over this incident.
('8', 298, 4, 21, 720862) At the same time, the Government, too, cannot be absolved wholly from blame.

('8', 298, 5, 24, 721067) 1 At Muzaffarpur, on April 30, 1908, Khudiram Bose flung a bomb at Kingsford, the District judge, as an act of political reprisal.
('8', 298, 5, 25, 721198) The bomb, however, hit a coach carrying two Englishwomen, Mrs. and Miss Kennedy.
('8', 298, 5, 26, 721279) Both the women and the syce were fatally wounded.
('8', 298, 5, 27, 721329) Khudiram Bose was subsequently sentenced to death.

('8', 299, 2, 3, 721447) In Canada Indians have raised a storm of protest which deserves attention.
('8', 299, 2, 4, 721522) We learn from newspapers sent us by a friend from Winnipeg that Indians abroad are becoming more public spirited everywhere.
('8', 299, 2, 5, 721647) Those who held the [protest] meeting were not concerned with any grievance of their own.
('8', 299, 2, 6, 721736) Some Indians reached [Canada] by way of Hong Kong.
('8', 299, 2, 7, 721787) They were not allowed to land by the Canadian Government, and this led to a [protest] meeting by Indian settlers in Canada.
('8', 299, 2, 8, 721911) Most of the participants were Sikhs 2. They met in a Sikhtemple and showed great spirit [in the meeting that ensued].
('8', 299, 2, 9, 722029) The meeting passed a resolution asserting that it would injure the cause of the British Empire if these Indians were forced to return.
('8', 299, 2, 10, 722164) They also argued that this would encourage those who opposed British rule [in India].
('8', 299, 2, 11, 722250) Resolutions [to that effect] were then passed.
('8', 299, 2, 12, 722297) The newspaper correspondent adds that fiery speeches were made at the meeting.
('8', 299, 3, 13, 722376) Such meetings and this unity emerging among Indians [abroad] augur well for Indias future.
('8', 299, 3, 14, 722467) The British Government is in a difficult situation.
('8', 299, 3, 15, 722519) It will have to act with great circumspection.
('8', 299, 3, 16, 722566) On the one hand, it has to please the Colony; on the other, it must protect Indian rights.
('8', 299, 3, 17, 722657) Mr. Morley is being put to a severe test.

('8', 299, 6, 20, 722766) The Cape Supreme Court has ruled in a case against a white that there is no provision in the Cape [Immigration] Act for deporting anyone.
('8', 299, 6, 21, 722904) Accordingly the order of deportation has been cancelled and the man set free.

('8', 299, 7, 24, 723205) 3 The meeting also sent a cable to John Morley, Secretary of State for India, seeking the protection of the Imperial Government and pointing out that its neglect of this problem would cause resentment in India.

('8', 300, 3, 6, 723632) Mr. Hamid Gool, son of Mr. Yusuf Gool of Cape Town, has been pursuing medical studies in England for some time now.
('8', 300, 3, 7, 723748) It would appear he has put his time to good use.
('8', 300, 3, 8, 723797) We gather from his latest letters that he has passed the examination with distinction and has been awarded a prize of 10. We offer our congratulations to both the Gools.

('8', 300, 5, 11, 724074) We understand that the Portuguese Government has withdrawn the provisional regulations regarding Asiatics in the Province of Mozambique which had been notified [in the Gazette] earlier.
('8', 300, 5, 12, 724260) It is also understood that an attempt will be made shortly to introduce fresh legislation for the registration of Asiatics which will make provi sion for the payment of an annual fee [by the registrant].
('8', 300, 5, 13, 724464) We once again advise the Delagoa Bay Indians, as we have so often done in the past, to remain vigilant.

('8', 300, 8, 17, 724647) This is the last week for voluntary registration.
('8', 300, 8, 18, 724697) Those intending to apply [for registration certificates] will have done so before the 9th.
('8', 300, 8, 19, 724788) It does not appear likely that applications will be accepted after that date.
('8', 300, 8, 20, 724866) It seems the Registrar has also sent round notices to that effect.

('8', 301, 1, 5, 725237) However, I give this warning in the belief that Monday may really be the last day.
('8', 301, 1, 6, 725320) About 8,700 applications for registration have been made and 6,000 applicants have already received their certificates.
('8', 301, 1, 7, 725440) The remain ing applications are still under consideration.
('8', 301, 1, 8, 725499) Apparently, they include applications on behalf of children, applications of persons holding the old Dutch registers and those of others about whose thumb impres sions there may be some doubt.
('8', 301, 1, 9, 725692) What happens to the applications of persons holding Dutch registers will depend on the number of cases in which the thumb impressions are suspect.
('8', 301, 1, 10, 725839) The remaining 2,000 also include a large number of bona fide certificate holders.

('8', 301, 2, 12, 725989) INTER COLONIAL CONFERENCE
('8', 301, 3, 13, 726015) A conference of all South African Colonies designated as above is now in session in Pretoria, with Mr. Moore, a Natal Minister 1, as President.
('8', 301, 3, 14, 726159) Among many others, the Asiatic question finds a place on the agenda.
('8', 301, 3, 15, 726228) It is likely to be discussed at length.
('8', 301, 3, 16, 726268) According to reports, the sessions are to be held in camera.
('8', 301, 3, 17, 726329) A very important resolution was passed at the Inter Colonial Conference.
('8', 301, 3, 18, 726402) It has bee resolved, on a proposal from Mr. Smuts, secon ded by Mr. Merriman 2, that steps be taken by all concerned to bring about a union of all the Colonies.
('8', 301, 3, 19, 726563) Commenting on this, newspapers favouring the Progressive Party point out that the Dutch are in a dominant position at present, especially because they are in power in the Orange River Colony, the Transvaal and the Cape; that is why they are disposed to talkof unification.
('8', 301, 3, 20, 726836) They want thereby to weaken the influence of British settlers in the Colonies.

('8', 302, 1, 2, 727347) 166. STORY OF A SOLDIER OF TRUTH [ V1]
('8', 302, 2, 3, 727386) It was by mistake, we [the editor] announced last week that this series was concluded.
('8', 302, 2, 4, 727473) Socrates ended his defence.
('8', 302, 2, 5, 727501) He was then found guilty by a majority vote.
('8', 302, 2, 6, 727546) Socrates spoke as follows on the question of the punishment to be awarded to him.
('8', 302, 3, 7, 727628) I am not vexed at your finding me guilty.
('8', 302, 3, 8, 727670) Your decision is not an unexpected one.
('8', 302, 3, 9, 727710) I am surprised rather at the large num ber of votes in my favour.
('8', 302, 3, 10, 727776) I had thought the majority against me would be an overwhelming one.
('8', 302, 3, 11, 727844) Instead, I find the margin is narrow.
('8', 302, 3, 12, 727882) If three 2 more had voted in my favour, I would have escaped [punishment].
('8', 302, 3, 13, 727957) I find, moreover, that I have been abso lved of the charge of not believing in the gods.
('8', 302, 3, 14, 728046) You can now sentence me to death.
('8', 302, 3, 15, 728080) What can I say about it?
('8', 302, 3, 16, 728105) What do I deserve to pay or suffer for having given up offi ces and political appointments and gone from house to house to teach virtue?
('8', 302, 3, 17, 728242) If in the gymnasium someone keeps you amused and gives you the illusion of happiness, you will maintain him at public expense.
('8', 302, 3, 18, 728369) I taught you the way to real happiness, not merely to the semblance of it.
('8', 302, 3, 19, 728444) If, therefore, I am entitled to ask for anything, it is that in my old age you should maintain me at public expense.
('8', 302, 3, 20, 728561) Perhaps you will think me arrogant for talking in this way after having been pronounced guilty, for demanding a re ward instead of punishment.
('8', 302, 3, 21, 728704) But it would not be true.
('8', 302, 3, 22, 728730) Though you have found me guilty, I believe myself innocent.
('8', 302, 3, 23, 728790) I have wronged no one.
('8', 302, 3, 24, 728813) You have not been able to understand this, for my examination lasted only a day.
('8', 302, 3, 25, 728894) How much can I explain to you in so short a time?
('8', 302, 3, 26, 728944) If I had had more time with you, per haps, I could have persuaded you to better effect.
('8', 302, 3, 27, 729032) Since I am innocent, I do not propose any penalty for myself.
('8', 302, 3, 28, 729094) Shall I pro pose imprisonment?
('8', 302, 3, 29, 729125) That will not be right.
('8', 302, 3, 30, 729149) Shall I pay a fine?
('8', 302, 4, 31, 729169) 1 If the offence was one for which the law laid down no precise penalty, then .
('8', 302, 4, 32, 729249) .the prosecutor, if he won his case, proposed one penalty, the accused proposed an alternative, and the jury [a section of the Assembly, since there were no judges] had to choose one of the two.
('8', 302, 4, 33, 729444) When Socrates had been condemned, the prosecution demanded the death penalty, but Socrates, first suggesting the Freedom of the City as the alternative, formally proposed, not exile, which the jury would gladly have accepted, but an almost derisory fine. H. D. F. Kitto: The Greeks.
('8', 302, 4, 34, 729727) It was Plato who persuaded Socrates to raise the fine he was to propose from one to thirty minae.
('8', 302, 4, 35, 729825) 2 This should be thirty.
('8', 303, 0, 1, 729850) 304 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 303, 1, 2, 729892) do not have the money for it.
('8', 303, 1, 3, 729922) Shall I propose exile?
('8', 303, 1, 4, 729945) How can I do that?
('8', 303, 1, 5, 729964) I do not hold my life so dear as to want to pass the rest of my days wandering from place to place, continually haunted by fear.
('8', 303, 1, 6, 730093) Someone may well suggest that I should retire into solitude and hold my peace.
('8', 303, 1, 7, 730172) I cannot do that either.
('8', 303, 1, 8, 730197) I believe I am commanded by the gods to discourse to people on what I hold to be virtue.
('8', 303, 1, 9, 730286) I am also commanded by the gods to look unceasingly for principles of moral conduct.
('8', 303, 1, 10, 730371) I do not think these are matters which you understand.
('8', 303, 1, 11, 730426) But that is no reason why I should hold my peace.
('8', 303, 1, 12, 730476) Socrates was then awarded the death penalty by the Court.
('8', 303, 1, 13, 730534) Un perturbed, the great Socrates immediately addressed the assembly as follows: In any case, I have only a few years left to live.
('8', 303, 1, 14, 730665) You could not be troubled to wait and you have earned an evil name for yourselves by condemning an innocent man to death.
('8', 303, 1, 15, 730787) If you had waited a while, I would have died in the course of nature, for I am an old man, far advanced in years.
('8', 303, 1, 16, 730901) If I had used ignoble arguments before you and adopted the course common on such occasions, I would have escaped the death penalty.
('8', 303, 1, 17, 731033) But that would have been inconsistent with my duty.
('8', 303, 1, 18, 731085) I am sure a free man will never do anything unworthy of himself to save himself from death or other danger.
('8', 303, 1, 19, 731193) One ought not to try to save oneself from death by any and every means.
('8', 303, 1, 20, 731265) In battle, a man can save himself by laying down his arms and surrendering to the ene my.
('8', 303, 1, 21, 731355) But we think such a man a coward.
('8', 303, 1, 22, 731389) In the same way, anyone who resorts to unscrupulous means to save himself from death is an unworthy person.
('8', 303, 1, 23, 731497) I think it is more difficult to save oneself from wickedness than from death, for wickedness is swifter than death.
('8', 303, 1, 24, 731613) Being impatient and rash, you have taken a step which sp ells wickednesswickedness which is so swift in its advance.
('8', 303, 1, 25, 731730) You have sentenced me to death.
('8', 303, 1, 26, 731762) I shall now leave this world.
('8', 303, 1, 27, 731792) My opponents will be looked upon as men who betrayed truth and perpetrated an injustice.
('8', 303, 1, 28, 731881) I will suffer my punishment.
('8', 303, 1, 29, 731910) But they will [also] suffer the penalty for their [evil] deeds.
('8', 303, 1, 30, 731974) This is what always happens.
('8', 303, 1, 31, 732003) Perhaps it is just as well that it should be so.
('8', 303, 1, 32, 732052) And now, before I die, I wish to address a few words to you.
('8', 303, 1, 33, 732113) I am sure that after I die you will come to suffer greatly.
('8', 304, 0, 1, 732173) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 305
('8', 304, 1, 2, 732218) You must not believe that, by getting rid of me, you will be able to go your wicked ways undisturbed.
('8', 304, 1, 3, 732320) Do not assume that there will be no one toreproach you.
('8', 304, 1, 4, 732376) Before I am taken to the place of execution, I shall address a few remarks to those who trust my words.
('8', 304, 1, 5, 732480) So, those who wish to hear what I have to say may please stay on.
('8', 304, 1, 6, 732546) I want to explain to you the meaning of death as I see it.
('8', 304, 1, 7, 732605) Believe that what has happened to me is a good thing and that those who believe that death is an evil must be mistaken.
('8', 304, 1, 8, 732725) Death may mean one of two things.
('8', 304, 1, 9, 732759) Either the dead man wholly ceases to be and loses all sensation or the soul migrates to another abode.
('8', 304, 1, 10, 732862) If the first belief is true and there is an end to all sensation, death is but the highest form of sleep.
('8', 304, 1, 11, 732968) We look uponsleep as a blessing.
('8', 304, 1, 12, 733001) If that is so, death, being the highest kind of sleep, must be a still greater blessing.
('8', 304, 1, 13, 733090) If, on the other hand, we believe that death is a journey to another place, I shall only join those who have preceded me.
('8', 304, 1, 14, 733212) In their presence, I shall get pure justice.
('8', 304, 1, 15, 733257) There is no evil in this.
('8', 304, 1, 16, 733283) If I have to go where Homer has gone, and other great souls with him, I shall deem it a great good fortune.
('8', 304, 1, 17, 733391) I count it a high honour that I should join the souls of those who were victims of unjust punishment.
('8', 304, 1, 18, 733493) Believe it as a truth that no good man can come by evil either in life or after death.
('8', 304, 1, 19, 733580) Such a man is never forsaken by God.
('8', 304, 1, 20, 733617) And you may be sure that the man of truth is always happy.
('8', 304, 1, 21, 733676) Therefore I am not unhappy that I am to die today and be released from these mortal coils.
('8', 304, 1, 22, 733767) And so I am not angry with the judges or with my accusers.
('8', 304, 1, 23, 733826) If they have wanted to do me evil, they deserve to be censured for that, but their intention can have no evil effect on me.
('8', 304, 1, 24, 733950) Now my last request: if, when my sons grow up, they begin to care for riches or for any other thing before virtue, if they think they are something when they are nothing at all, warn them, censure them, punish them just in the same manner as I have warned you against these things and reproached you with the love of them.
('8', 304, 1, 25, 734273) If you can do this, I shall consider that you have been kind to me and my sons.
('8', 304, 1, 26, 734353) Now the time has come, and we must go hence: I to die, and you to live.
('8', 304, 1, 27, 734425) God alone can tell which is the better state, mine or yours.
('8', 304, 1, 28, 734486) This is a historical event, that is, an event that actually occurred.
('8', 304, 1, 29, 734556) We pray to God, and want our readers also to pray, that they, and we
('8', 305, 0, 1, 734625) 306 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

('8', 306, 2, 3, 736096) [JOHANNESBURG,] May 14, 1908 Personal
('8', 306, 3, 4, 736134) DEAR MR. CARTWRIGHT, Perhaps the Angel of Peace will again have to be requisitioned.
('8', 306, 3, 5, 736219) The accompanying copies 1 will tell their own tale.
('8', 306, 3, 6, 736271) I do not think it is necessary for you to move just yet, but the situation that has arisenshows the danger of trusting suspiciously.
('8', 306, 3, 7, 736404) The letter 2 you brought was after thestyle of Delphic oracles.
('8', 306, 3, 8, 736468) You will recollect I expressed my views then, and told you that a document of that nature I could only sign because you were in it.
('8', 306, 5, 9, 736600) Yours sincerely, A. CARTWRIGHT, ESP.

('8', 306, 8, 13, 736738) JOHANNESBURG, May 14, 1908
('8', 306, 9, 14, 736765) DEAR MR. LANE, I have your letter of the 13th instant, for which I beg to tender my thanks to Mr. Smuts.
('8', 306, 9, 15, 736870) The letter, in my opinion, raises a tremen dous question, and gives rise to a very great misunderstanding.
('8', 306, 9, 16, 736977) When the negotiations were going on, I could never have dreamed of accep ting a compromise which would mean a differential treatment of Asia tics entering after the period of three month.
('8', 306, 9, 17, 737165) 4 Had such been the
('8', 306, 10, 18, 737185) 1 Of the correspondence with General Smuts 2 Vide Letter to Colonial Secretary, 28 1 1908 3 This letter was published in Indian Opinion, 4 7 1908, and a copy of it was sent of July 27, by Ritch as an annexure to his letter of July 27, 1908, to the Colonial Office.
('8', 306, 10, 19, 737450) 4 In Lanes letter of May 13, 1908, General Smuts had argued that the same mode of registration was to apply to this category of persons as to all other Asiatic residents in the Transvaal who were to register voluntarily within the three month period.
('8', 306, 10, 20, 737701) That is to say, those returning to the Colony after May 9 would be treated under the law in exactly the same way as those Asiatics in the.
('8', 306, 10, 21, 737840) Colony who had refused to register voluntarily.
('8', 306, 10, 22, 737888) Vide S. N. 4812,
('8', 307, 0, 1, 737905) 308 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 307, 1, 2, 737947) understanding, steps would certainly have been then taken to inform Indians even in India and that could only have been done by cable grams, in order to enable the people to return to the Transvaal within three months, and even then I do not know that it would have been at all a just thing to expect Indians from India within that period in order to exchange their documents.
('8', 307, 1, 3, 738324) The limitation only applied to those who were then resident in the Transvaal.
('8', 307, 1, 4, 738402) General Smuts will, on a per usal of the letter signed by me and my fellow prisoners, see that the sentence Such mode of registration should apply to those also who, being out of the Colony, may return and otherwise possess the right of re entry was added by me to the letter brought by Mr. Cartwright, as were certain other words.
('8', 307, 1, 5, 738734) It was never contemplated that to such Asia tics the tentative period of three months should apply.
('8', 307, 1, 6, 738834) Nor was the alternative course of keeping voluntary registration open for an inde finite period ever thought of by me, andI do not suggest any such course now.
('8', 307, 1, 7, 738994) But the essence of the compromise is that, the under taking of the Indian community being fulfilled, as I claim it has been, the Act should be repealed.
('8', 307, 1, 8, 739147) Voluntary registration should go on in connection with those who may arrive until the Act is repealed.
('8', 307, 1, 9, 739250) As will be noticed from the Draft submitted by me, provision is made for the identification of those who may arrive after the passing of the Draft Bill.
('8', 307, 1, 10, 739403) So that there is no question of keeping voluntary registration open for an indefinite period.
('8', 307, 1, 11, 739497) Of course, if it is desired by General Smuts that no registration should take place now, but that it should await the passing of the new legislation, I do not mind; but to require Indians who may enter now to come under the Act will only accentuate the suspicion that is still lurking in the minds of some of my countrymen.
('8', 307, 1, 12, 739821) In order to make good my word, as also to assist the Government, it is within the Gen erals knowledge that I very nearly lost my life, and this arose beca use, in the opinion of some of my countrymen, I had sold them, by reason of having agreed to the principle of ten finger prints.
('8', 307, 1, 13, 740105) Were the proposed registration under the Act of new arrivals persisted in, not only will suspicion be accentuated, but it will be justified, and I cannot help saying that those who may feel irritated against me will be enti tled to my life.
('8', 307, 1, 14, 740346) I should consider myself totally unworthy of the trust reposed in me by my countrymen, and to hold the position that they have allowed me to hold for such a long time, were I ever to consent to the Act being applied to new comers.
('8', 307, 1, 15, 740577) If the Act was bad, as I res pectfully contend it was, it was so for all, except for those who, owing
('8', 308, 0, 1, 740679) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 309
('8', 308, 1, 2, 740724) to their fraud or obstinacy, would not voluntarily provide facility to the Government for their identification.
('8', 308, 1, 3, 740836) I am, therefore, sure that Gen eral Smuts will reconsider the matter, and not only not ask me to use whatever influence I may possess with my countrymen in the direction desired by him, but that he will assist me to make good my word to them, by either accepting voluntary registration of new arrivals or informing them that they need not be identified until after the passing of the new legislation, especially as the purpose of identification is equally well served under the compromise.
('8', 308, 1, 4, 741326) As the matter is exceedingly urgent, may I ask that a telegraphic reply be sent to me?
('8', 308, 2, 5, 741413) Yours truly,

('8', 309, 1, 2, 742641) emphatic at this moment.
('8', 309, 1, 3, 742666) I find that we are all engrossed overmuch in the affairs of this world.
('8', 309, 1, 4, 742738) I see that the whole country is in the same predicament in which our family finds itself.
('8', 309, 1, 5, 742828) I express here only those ideas which are now uppermost in my mind.
('8', 309, 1, 6, 742896) Out of a false sense of prestige or mistaken notions of affection, we think of marrying off our boys and girls at a very early age.
('8', 309, 1, 7, 743028) We spend a lot of money doing so and then look on sadly at the young widows.
('8', 309, 1, 8, 743105) I do not suggest that people should not marry at all.
('8', 309, 1, 9, 743159) But surely we should observe some limits.
('8', 309, 1, 10, 743201) We marry off little boys and girls and make them miserable.
('8', 309, 1, 11, 743261) They have children and get into difficulties.Sexual intercourse is allowed by our shastras only for the purpose of progeny.
('8', 309, 1, 12, 743385) For the rest it is sheer indulgence.
('8', 309, 1, 13, 743422) I do not see that we follow this path in the least.
('8', 309, 1, 14, 743474) If what I say is true, by marrying off our children as early as we ourselves were mar ried, we only make them sensual; and thus the tree of lust flourishes.
('8', 309, 1, 15, 743631) I do not think this is religion whatever others may say.
('8', 309, 1, 16, 743688) I shall say no more.
('8', 309, 1, 17, 743709) You have given me the news from your end, but what answer can I give you?
('8', 309, 1, 18, 743783) I only express these thoughts as they occur to me, and, though younger than you, place them before the entire family through you.
('8', 309, 1, 19, 743913) This is the service I can render to the family.
('8', 309, 1, 20, 743961) If youconsider this presumptuous, please forgive me.
('8', 309, 1, 21, 744014) I put these thoughts of mine before you on this occasion after fourteen years of study and contemplation and seven years of practice.

('8', 309, 5, 26, 744388) [JOHANNESBURG, Before May 16, 1908]
('8', 309, 6, 27, 744424) As the leading member of the community most concerned, Mr. M. K. Gandhi, the Johannesburg lawyer, is entitled to a very considerable audience on the subject of the legislation which Natal proposes regarding its Indians.
('8', 309, 6, 28, 744644) With reference to the first Bill that is to stop indentured immi gration, so far as I am aware every Indian will welcome it.
('8', 309, 6, 29, 744769) The only regret will be that the stopping did not come sooner, and that it is still not to come for two years.
('8', 309, 6, 30, 744880) Had indentured labour from India not
('8', 310, 0, 1, 744917) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 311
('8', 310, 1, 2, 744962) been imported, there would have been no Indian question in South Africa.
('8', 310, 1, 3, 745035) Of course, the reason for Indian satisfaction may not be, and is not, the same as that for European satisfaction.
('8', 310, 1, 4, 745149) Indians consider that the system of indentures is of little, if any, benefit to India as a wholeor to the Indians concerned.
('8', 310, 1, 5, 745274) It does not tend to the elevation or pro gress of the indentured people, and in the words of the late Sir William Wilson Hunter 1, the official historian of India, it is a state of semi slavery.
('8', 310, 1, 6, 745469) As to the two other Bills, they are open to very serious objection.
('8', 310, 1, 7, 745537) I have never heard of such legislation in any British Colony.
('8', 310, 1, 8, 745599) The first of these two licensing Bills contemplates the stopping of all new licences in Natal.
('8', 310, 1, 9, 745694) This means the stopping of the removal of the same business from one place to another, because as soon as a trader remo ves to another place, it is considered to be a new business and a further licence is necessary.
('8', 310, 1, 10, 745910) This Bill, if it becomes law, must mean ruin, practically, to Indian traders.
('8', 310, 1, 11, 745988) Why should not the partner of a man who holds a licence in his own name, as soon as he severs his connection with the partnership, be able to take out a licence for himself?
('8', 310, 1, 12, 746162) And yet prohibition to trade will be the effect of this Bill.
('8', 310, 1, 13, 746224) There aremany other points in the Bill which must strike at decent Indian existence in Natal.
('8', 310, 1, 14, 746318) Some of the Indians, who are born traders, cannot take up any other employment or pursuit.
('8', 310, 1, 15, 746409) To them, Natal is their home.
('8', 310, 1, 16, 746439) What are they to do if they may not trade?
('8', 310, 1, 17, 746482) It will be simply encouragement for fraud if the Bill is persisted in.
('8', 310, 1, 18, 746553) It is perfectly true that the position of the Indian trader under the present licensing law is not much better.
('8', 310, 1, 19, 746665) He is always in a state of uncertainty, but that does not mean that the present Bill can be justified.
('8', 310, 1, 20, 746768) Moreover, even with reference to the existing licensing law, the position has become very critical and during my last visit to Natal I noticed that Indian traders had become very uncomfortable and were considering what could be done to obtain amelioration.
('8', 310, 1, 21, 747025) The recent cable from Home also shows that the Colonial Office is still reasoning with the Natal Government with a view to the amendment or repeal of the Dealers Licenses Act of Natal.
('8', 310, 1, 22, 747210) The second licensing Bill is, in truth, a confiscation of what rights there may be left after the full effect has been produced by the operation of the first Bill.
('8', 310, 1, 23, 747374) Thus the second Bill gives ten years notice

('8', 311, 1, 2, 747847) to the Indian traders to quit.
('8', 311, 1, 3, 747878) If there are any left at the end of that period, they are to receive compensation on a basis of three yearsprofits.
('8', 311, 1, 4, 747994) This is ridiculous.
('8', 311, 1, 5, 748014) How can such compensation be an adequate return for confiscating a growing business?
('8', 311, 1, 6, 748099) This compens ation can never enable the Indian to live on the interest thereof for the rest of his lifetime.
('8', 311, 1, 7, 748208) I assume of course that such an Indian will not, except in rare cases, carry on his trade elsewhere.
('8', 311, 1, 8, 748309) I know that an attempt has been made to justify the second Bill by comparing it with the liquor licensing legislation at Home.
('8', 311, 1, 9, 748436) The two, however, can hardly be compared.
('8', 311, 1, 10, 748478) In the other case the restriction of the liquor trade is necessary for the moral well being of the whole community.
('8', 311, 1, 11, 748594) No such argument can be advanced in connection with the Indian traders.
('8', 311, 1, 12, 748666) Whatever their defects may be, no one has been able to impute more dishonesty to them than to other traders, and Indian trade, per se, is not held to be harmful as the liquor trade undoubtedly is.
('8', 311, 1, 13, 748863) I do not anticipate that such legislation will be passed, but the very fact that responsible Ministers in South Africa can contemplate with equanimity the passing of such legislation is a most deplorable one, and saps the foundations of Imperial statesmanship and Imperial federation.
('8', 311, 1, 14, 749148) Many Imperialists in England include India also as part of Imperial federation and I do not know that it is possible to have at all a British Empire, leaving India out, seeing that, according to Lord Curzon, India is the dome of the Imperial edifice and that it is India which makes the term Empire possible.

('8', 311, 2, 16, 749483) 172. NATAL BILLS
('8', 311, 3, 17, 749500) The more one examines the Natal Licensing Bills, the greater is the feeling of dissatisfaction over them.
('8', 311, 3, 18, 749606) The Bills are an open challenge to the Imperial Government.
('8', 311, 3, 19, 749666) They frankly and openly attack Indians, not Asiatics generally.
('8', 311, 3, 20, 749730) They attack not Coloured people but Indians only.
('8', 311, 3, 21, 749780) A Chinaman may, therefore, freely trade in Natal, save for the restrictions provided by Act 18 of 1896, but an Indian may not.
('8', 311, 3, 22, 749907) The Zulu, very properly, we think, is unhampered, but the Indian, whether born in Natal or not, must not trade after a certain date.
('8', 311, 3, 23, 750040) The Mercury pertinently asks whether an Indian may carry on the trade of a barber.
('8', 311, 3, 24, 750123) And if he may, why should the European grocer and the general dealer alone be protected?
('8', 311, 3, 25, 750212) But to examine the details of the proposed legislation is not to understand it.
('8', 311, 3, 26, 750292) In order to understand it properly, it is necessary tolook
('8', 312, 0, 1, 750351) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 313
('8', 312, 1, 2, 750396) beneath the surface.
('8', 312, 1, 3, 750417) The Natal Government, then, by bringing forward the Bills, state their Indian policy.
('8', 312, 1, 4, 750503) In their opinion, the Colony has a perfect right to drive away Indians, not to recognize them as British subjects and to do as they choose with them without regard to Imperial obligations.
('8', 312, 1, 5, 750692) In Kiplings words, the Servant is to be the Master.
('8', 312, 1, 6, 750744) It is not enough that Natal is to be Mistress in her own, but it is to dictate terms to the Imperial Government.
('8', 312, 1, 7, 750857) For we brush aside the idea that the proposed treatment of Indians can ever be part of the powers of self governing colonies.
('8', 312, 1, 8, 750983) And what Natal wishes to do is, after all, what most British Colonies would also like to copy.
('8', 312, 1, 9, 751078) What will India do?
('8', 312, 1, 10, 751098) The Indian Government, if they would faith fully discharge their trust, have a clear duty before them.
('8', 312, 1, 11, 751201) They cannot see Indian emigrants being ruined and sacrificed on the altar of pre judice.
('8', 312, 1, 12, 751290) But whether they realize their duty or not, it is clearly for the people of India to wake up and assert their right of protecting the interests of their cousins across the sea.
('8', 312, 1, 13, 751467) Every hamlet in India should express its abhorrence of the cruel injustice that is dealt out to their brethren who have emigrated to the Colonies.

('8', 312, 2, 15, 751640) 173. NEW NATAL BILLS
('8', 312, 3, 16, 751661) The more closely one examines the Natal Governments new licensing Bills, the more wicked one finds themso wicked indeed that most South African newspapers have denounced them.
('8', 312, 3, 17, 751837) In Natal, the Mercury and The Times of Natal have opposed the Bills.
('8', 312, 3, 18, 751906) Among the Johannesburg newspapers, even The Star has been writing stron gly against them.
('8', 312, 3, 19, 751996) The Leader, too, has spoken out.
('8', 312, 3, 20, 752029) Rand Daily Mail alone appears to be favourably disposed towards the Government.
('8', 312, 3, 21, 752109) That the Bills have been condemned in this manner does not mean that the Indian community may look on, a silent spectator.
('8', 312, 3, 22, 752232) Though many of the newspapers have condemned the Bills, they approve of their object.
('8', 312, 3, 23, 752318) They would be happy to see Indian trade ruined.
('8', 312, 3, 24, 752366) They are convinced that the presence of the Indians in South Africa does not conduce to the Colonys interests.
('8', 312, 3, 25, 752477) They only point out that such Bills are without precedent in British rule, and that the Imperial Government may not assent to them.
('8', 312, 3, 26, 752609) If the whites could give up all pretence to decency or had no fear of the Imperial Government, all of them in South Africa would jump at the first chance of throwing the Indians out with the utmost despatch.
('8', 312, 3, 27, 752817) As long as the whites entertain such ideas, the Indians in South
('8', 313, 0, 1, 752882) 314 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 313, 1, 2, 752924) Africa, or in the other Colonies for that matter, cannot afford to be complacent.
('8', 313, 1, 3, 753006) That the local newspapers have taken up a favourable attitude should not give rise to any illusions.
('8', 313, 1, 4, 753107) The lamb will not feel secure merely because the lion is in the cage and can do him no harm.
('8', 313, 1, 5, 753200) He will ever go about cautiously and in fear of the lion.
('8', 313, 1, 6, 753258) We are in the same plight as the lamb.
('8', 313, 1, 7, 753297) It is not that the common whites here are in love with us.
('8', 313, 1, 8, 753356) They merely desist from acting to our detriment in matters in which they are helpless.
('8', 313, 1, 9, 753443) They have the lions nature which they cannot transform into that of a lamb.
('8', 313, 1, 10, 753519) We are lambs who must, however, become lions.
('8', 313, 1, 11, 753565) When we succeed in that, mutual regard will come as a matter of course.
('8', 313, 1, 12, 753637) It is the law of this worldnot a divine lawthat there can be love or friendship only among equals.
('8', 313, 1, 13, 753736) Princes befriend princes.
('8', 313, 1, 14, 753762) In a king there can be nothing but condescension towards his subjects.
('8', 313, 1, 15, 753833) That is why some persons want republics.
('8', 313, 1, 16, 753874) There is no love lost between master and servant.
('8', 313, 1, 17, 753924) This is found to be true in every sphere.
('8', 313, 1, 18, 753966) Wherever we find a relationship contrary to this rule that is, friendship even in the absence of equalitywe know that the superior party is actuated by some self interest, or that he is an exceptionally good person.
('8', 313, 1, 19, 754182) The whites look upon us as a subject race.
('8', 313, 1, 20, 754225) As long as they persist in this attitude there can be no mutual regard.
('8', 313, 1, 21, 754297) In the absence of mutualregard, the cause of Indian discontent is bound to remain.
('8', 313, 1, 22, 754380) The Indian community will therefore be able to exercise its rights only when it develops a lion like nature.
('8', 313, 1, 23, 754489) The beauty of the Natal Bills is that they do not apply to the Chinese, let alone the Kaffirs.
('8', 313, 1, 24, 754584) If the Bills are passed, it will make out Indians to be the lowliest [among the Coloured persons].
('8', 313, 1, 25, 754683) We believe the Natal Governments object in bringing forward these Bills is to ascertain white reaction and test Indian strength.
('8', 313, 1, 26, 754812) They seem to think that, if the Indian community does not protest in this case or does so only perfunctorily, it may be possible to bring greater pressure to bear on it on future occasions.
('8', 313, 1, 27, 755002) It will not be enough, therefore, that the Natal Indians merely resist these Bills; they should challenge the very principle underlying them.
('8', 313, 1, 28, 755144) They must wake up from their sleep.
('8', 313, 1, 29, 755180) No one, whether businessman or not, should imagine that trade is all that matters; it is also necessary to acquire true education.
('8', 313, 1, 30, 755311) Having acquired that for oneself, one must educate ones children.
('8', 313, 1, 31, 755377) It is only when the Indian community thus cultivates its talents in every way that it will learn tobe vigilant.
('8', 313, 1, 32, 755489) He who becomes vigilant may become leonine.
('8', 313, 1, 33, 755533) The remedy

('8', 314, 4, 6, 755745) INTER COLONIAL CONFERENCE 2
('8', 314, 5, 7, 755773) A number of resolutions are believed to have been passed at this conference, though its proceedings were kept strictly confidential.
('8', 314, 5, 8, 755906) It is believed, moreover, that this was done at the instance of the Natal poli ticians, who did not want the question of federation to be discussed in public for the time being.
('8', 314, 5, 9, 756084) There are also reports of a serious rift among the Council members on the question of customs duties.
('8', 314, 6, 10, 756186) REGISTRATION
('8', 314, 7, 11, 756199) Voluntary registration ended on the 9th.
('8', 314, 7, 12, 756240) New applications are not accepted any longer.
('8', 314, 7, 13, 756286) That is to say, those who have not so far applied [for registration certificates] will be left out.
('8', 314, 7, 14, 756386) Indians with permits are now entitled to enter the Transvaal and also voluntarily to apply for registration.
('8', 314, 7, 15, 756495) In spite of this, Mr. Chamney has issued an order that since the time limitfor voluntary registration has expired, new comers have perforce to take out registers under the law.
('8', 314, 7, 16, 756672) This order shows two things: first that voluntary registration is of great value; secondly, that the Registration Office has erred againas it has so often in the pastin issuing this order.
('8', 314, 7, 17, 756861) General Smuts is seized of the matter, and there has been an exchange of messages by telegraph and over the telephone.
('8', 314, 7, 18, 756980) The final decision can only be that the new entrants into the Transvaal are entitled to seek registration voluntarily and that such persons will also be exempt from the law.
('8', 314, 7, 19, 757154) Eligible Indians who enter the Transvaal from now on must be patient and remain unconcerned.
('8', 314, 7, 20, 757247) It is probable that by the time this letter goes into print this order will have been withdrawn.
('8', 314, 7, 21, 757344) If, however, it is not, the foregoing suggestion should be kept in mind.
('8', 314, 7, 22, 757417) If the officials violatethe terms of the settlement, it will be possible to set matters right.

('8', 315, 3, 4, 757791) The cry continues to be heard here and all over South Africa.
('8', 315, 3, 5, 757853) Captain Cooke, who some time ago sponsored a resolution for the expulsion of Indians at a meeting of the Progressive Party and whose resolution was rejected, has now written a letter to The Star.
('8', 315, 3, 6, 758049) He points out that the proposed legislation for this purpose in Natal is unneces sary.
('8', 315, 3, 7, 758136) What is needed is to find a colony for Indians which is climat ically unsuitable for white settlement.
('8', 315, 3, 8, 758239) Captain Cooke suggests that Indians be settled there and adds that there would be justice in such a course.
('8', 315, 3, 9, 758347) 1 The Star has supported the proposal to some extent, but this journal has been writing strongly against the projected Natal legis lation.

('8', 315, 5, 12, 758550) PREFACE
('8', 315, 6, 13, 758558) People in the West generally hold that it is mans duty to promote the happinessprosperity, that isof the greatest number.
('8', 315, 7, 14, 758680) Happiness is taken to mean material happiness exclusively, that is, economic prosperity.
('8', 315, 7, 15, 758769) If, in the pursuit of this happiness moral, laws are violated, it does not matter much.
('8', 315, 7, 16, 758857) Again, as the object is the happi ness of the greatest number, people in the West do not believe it to be wrong if it is secured at the cost of the minority.
('8', 315, 7, 17, 759015) The consequences of this attitude are in evidence in all western countries.
('8', 315, 7, 18, 759091) The exclusive quest for the physical and material happiness of the majority has no sanction in divine law.
('8', 315, 7, 19, 759198) In fact, some thoughtful persons in the West have pointed out that it is contrary to divine law to

('8', 315, 8, 21, 759479) Gandhiji opposed it on moral grounds; vide The Pietersburg Claptrap, 13 8 1904. Ruskin, too, criticized the construction of a science of economics on the Newtonain model from which social affections had been wholly abstracted.
('8', 315, 8, 22, 759706) Ruskin argued that the greatest art or science was that which aroused the greatest number of the greatest ideas.
('8', 316, 0, 1, 759819) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 317
('8', 316, 1, 2, 759864) pursue happiness in violation of moral principles.
('8', 316, 1, 3, 759915) The late John Ruskin 1 was foremost among these.
('8', 316, 1, 4, 759964) He was an Englishman of great learning.
('8', 316, 1, 5, 760004) He has written numerous books on art and crafts.
('8', 316, 1, 6, 760053) He has also written a great deal on ethical questions.
('8', 316, 1, 7, 760108) One of these books, a small one, Ruskin himself believed to be his best.
('8', 316, 1, 8, 760181) It is read widely wherever English is spoken.
('8', 316, 1, 9, 760227) In the book, he has effectively countered these arguments and shown that the well being of the people at large consists in conforming to the moral law.
('8', 316, 1, 10, 760379) We in India are much given nowadays to imitation of the West.
('8', 316, 1, 11, 760441) We do grant that it is necessary to imitate the West in certain respects.
('8', 316, 1, 12, 760515) At the same time there is no doubt that many western ideas are wrong.
('8', 316, 1, 13, 760585) It will be admitted on all hands that what is bad must be eschewed.
('8', 316, 1, 14, 760653) The condition of Indians in South Africa is pitiable.
('8', 316, 1, 15, 760707) We go out to distant lands to make money.
('8', 316, 1, 16, 760749) We are so taken up with this that we become oblivious of morality and of God.
('8', 316, 1, 17, 760827) We become engrossed in the pursuit of self interest.
('8', 316, 1, 18, 760880) In the sequel, we find that going abroad does us more harm than good, or does not profit us as much as it ought to.
('8', 316, 1, 19, 760996) All religions presuppose the moral law, but even if we disregard religion as such, its observance is necessary on grounds of common sense also.
('8', 316, 1, 20, 761140) Our happiness consists in observing it.
('8', 316, 1, 21, 761180) This is what John Ruskin has established.
('8', 316, 1, 22, 761222) He has opened the eyes of the western people to this, and today, we see a large number of Europeans modelling their conduct on his teaching.
('8', 316, 1, 23, 761363) In order that Indians may profit by his ideas, we have decided to present extracts from his book, in a manner intelligible to Indians who do not know English.
('8', 316, 1, 24, 761522) Socrates gave us some idea of mans duty.
('8', 316, 1, 25, 761563) He practised his pre cepts.
('8', 316, 1, 26, 761591) It can be argued that Ruskins ideas are an elaboration of Socratess.
('8', 316, 1, 27, 761660) Ruskin has described vividly how one who wants to live by Socratess ideas should acquit himself in the different vocations.
('8', 316, 2, 28, 761784) 1 (1819 1900); a Scotsman and author of many books on architecture, painting, social and industrial problems, the place of women in society, etc; Slade Professor of Art in Oxford for some time; later became opposed to vivisection and usury and interested in workers education and co operative industrial settlements.
('8', 316, 2, 29, 762101) Together with Munera Pulveris, Unto This Last, which was published as a series of articles in Cornhill Magazine, expounds Ruskins social utopia.
('8', 316, 2, 30, 762246) Gandhiji describes Ruskin as one of the three moderns.
('8', 316, 2, 31, 762301) .who made a deep impress on me.
('8', 316, 2, 32, 762333) Unto This Last brought about an instantaneous and practical transformation.
('8', 316, 2, 33, 762409) .I arose with the dawn, ready to reduce these principles to practice.
('8', 316, 2, 34, 762479) Polak commended this book to Gandhiji who read it on the train journey between Johannesburg and Durban.

('8', 317, 1, 2, 762665) summary of his work which we offer here is not really a translation.
('8', 317, 1, 3, 762734) If we translated it, the common reader might be unable to follow some of the Biblical allusions, etc.
('8', 317, 1, 4, 762836) We present therefore only the substance of Ruskins work.
('8', 317, 1, 5, 762893) We do not even explain what the title of the book means, for it be understood only by a person who has read the Bible in English.
('8', 317, 1, 6, 763023) 1 But since the object which the book works towards is the welfare of allthat is, the advancement of all and not merely of the greatest number we have entitled these articles Sarvodaya.
('8', 317, 2, 7, 763209) ROOTS OF TRUTH 2
('8', 317, 3, 8, 763226) Man suffers from many delusions; but none so great as his attempt to formulate laws for the conduct of other men disregarding the effects of social affection, as if they were only machines at work.
('8', 317, 3, 9, 763424) That we cherish such an illusion does us no credit.
('8', 317, 3, 10, 763476) Like other forms of error, the laws of political economy also contain an element of plausibility.
('8', 317, 3, 11, 763574) Political economists assert that social affections are to be looked upon as accidental and disturbing elements in human nature; but avarice and the desire for progress are constant elements.
('8', 317, 3, 12, 763765) Let us eliminate the inconstants and, considering man merely as a money making machine, examine by what laws of labour, purchase and sale, the greatest amount of wealth can be accumulated.
('8', 317, 3, 13, 763954) Those laws once determined, it will be for each individual afterwards to introduce as much of the disturbing affectional elements as he chooses.
('8', 317, 3, 14, 764099) This would be a convincing argument if the social affections were of the same nature as the laws of demand and supply.
('8', 317, 3, 15, 764218) Mans affections constitute an inner force.
('8', 317, 3, 16, 764261) The laws of demand and supply are formulations concerning the external world.
('8', 317, 3, 17, 764339) The two, therefore, are not of the same nature.
('8', 317, 3, 18, 764387) If a moving body is acted upon by a constant force from one direction and a varying force from another, we would first measure the constant force and then the inconstant.
('8', 317, 3, 19, 764558) We will be able to determine the velocity of the body by comparing the two forces.
('8', 317, 3, 20, 764641) We can do this because the constant and the inconstant forces are of the same kind.
('8', 317, 3, 21, 764725) But in social dealings the constant force of the laws of demand and supply and the accidental force of social affection are forces that differ in kind.
('8', 317, 3, 22, 764877) Affection has a different kind of effect on man and acts in a different manner.
('8', 317, 3, 23, 764957) It changes

('8', 318, 1, 3, 765346) A knowledge of the laws of exchange is of no help in determining the effects of mans social affections.

('8', 318, 3, 6, 765516) [JOHANNESBURG, May 18, 1908]
('8', 318, 4, 7, 765545) The following address was given by Mr. M. K. Gandhi, Bar at Law, before the Y.M.C.A., Johannesburg, in moving the negative in a debate on the question, Are Asiatics and the Coloured races a menace to the Empire? It seems to me somewhat remarkable that a question of this description should arise at all, or that there should be any debate whatsoever as to whether Coloured races are a menace to the Empire.
('8', 318, 4, 8, 765952) I think that a question of that description could arise only in the Colo nies or, better still, only in some of the Colonies.
('8', 318, 4, 9, 766078) In a well ordered society industrious and intelligent men can never be a menace.
('8', 318, 4, 10, 766159) If they have any defects, the very order of the society corrects them.
('8', 318, 4, 11, 766230) At the same time, we, as practical men and women living in this very practical age, have to face facts as they are and, seeing that questions of this description arise in the Colonies, it is undoubtedly well that we should discuss them and debate upon them; and, to my mind, it is a very happy augury for the future that your humble servant can be called upon to give his views on the question before an audience like this, and I think it is also a happy augury that this hall is so well filled, showing the keen interest taken in the subject.
('8', 318, 4, 12, 766774) By the term Coloured people generally, I think we under stand only offspring of mixed marriages, but in connection with the question before us this evening, the term Coloured people has been taken more comprehensively, and has been made to include the Coloured people properthe Africans and the Asiatics.
('8', 318, 4, 13, 767079) My own observations and experience, as you know, are confined very largely to British Indians, my own fellow countrymen, but in studying the Indian question, I have endeavoured to study the question as it affects the Africans and the Chinese.
('8', 318, 4, 14, 767322) It seems to me that both the Africans and the Asiatics have advanced the Empire as a whole; we can hardly think of South Africa without the African races.
('8', 318, 4, 15, 767477) And who can think of the British Empire without India?
('8', 318, 4, 16, 767532) South Africa would probably be a howling wilderness without the Africans.
('8', 318, 4, 17, 767606) I do not think that the white
('8', 319, 0, 1, 767636) 320 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 319, 1, 2, 767678) man would have come to South Africa at all if there had been no Native races.
('8', 319, 1, 3, 767756) This brings me to the White Mans Burden as Kipling has called it.
('8', 319, 1, 4, 767822) His writings, to my mind, have been very much misunderstood.
('8', 319, 1, 5, 767883) We know now also that he himself has very considerably, with extended experience, revised his views, and he no longer thinks that the Colo ured people are a menace to the Empire, or that the white man may not coexist with the Coloured man.
('8', 319, 1, 6, 768123) Be that as it may, he has certainly shown in some of his writings that it was really a responsibility thrown on the white people, more particularly on the British people, to act as trustees for the Coloured races.
('8', 319, 1, 7, 768337) But have the white people acted as trustees?
('8', 319, 1, 8, 768382) Would you consider that your own wards were a menace to yourselves?
('8', 319, 1, 9, 768450) The majority of people in South Africa, the majority of people in most of the Colonies, have become impatient of colour, and it behoves every right minded man and woman to think twice before he or she jumps to the conclusion that the Coloured people are a men ace and that, therefore, they ought to be got rid of with the greatest possible despatch.
('8', 319, 1, 10, 768800) We hear nowadays a great deal of the segregation policy, as if it were possible to put people in water tight compartments.
('8', 319, 1, 11, 768923) Captain Cooke has written to the papers 1 and has taken the trouble of discussing the same question with me, and has propounded a policy of segregation.
('8', 319, 1, 12, 769076) I had no hesitation in telling him that, in my own opinion, based now on 14 years observation and study, such a scheme, if it was meant to people some portions of East Africa with Coloured people only or, better still, with Asiatics only, was not possible of fulfilment.
('8', 319, 1, 13, 769347) How are you going to restrict Asiatics to some parts of the earth only?
('8', 319, 1, 14, 769419) Will they be content to have those portions of the earth which may be apportioned to them and which are unfit for white occupation?
('8', 319, 1, 15, 769551) I have certainly never been able to find any justification for the colourbarrier.
('8', 319, 1, 16, 769633) In the words of Mr. Chamberlain, it is possible to make distinctions on the ground of want of education, on the ground of criminality, or some such ground.
('8', 319, 1, 17, 769789) Then there will be no cry of segregation.
('8', 319, 1, 18, 769831) But from the present civilisation, or, rather, from western civilization, there flow two propositions which have almost become maxims to live byI call them fallacious maxims.
('8', 319, 1, 19, 770006) They are might is right and survival of the fittest.
('8', 319, 1, 20, 770059) Those whohave propounded these two maxims have given a meaning to them.
('8', 319, 1, 21, 770131) I am not going into the meaning that might be attached in our minds to them, but they have said undoubtedly, by [saying] might is right, that physical might is right, that physical strength is right and

('8', 320, 1, 2, 770416) supreme.
('8', 320, 1, 3, 770425) Some of them have also combined intellectual strength with physical strength, but I would replace both these with heart strength, and I say that nobody with merely physical might and intellectual might can everenjoy that strength that can proceed from the heart.
('8', 320, 1, 4, 770688) It never can be that mere intellectual or mere physical strength can ever supersede the heart strength or, as Ruskin would say, social affections.
('8', 320, 1, 5, 770835) A quickening and quickened soul responds only to the springs of the heart.
('8', 320, 1, 6, 770910) That 1 is the difference between western and eastern civilization?
('8', 320, 1, 7, 770977) I know that I am treading on very dangerous and delicate ground.
('8', 320, 1, 8, 771042) We had the distinction given to us by so great an authority as Lord Selborne only a short time ago, and I have very humbly and very respectfully to differ from His Excellencys views.
('8', 320, 1, 9, 771225) 2 It appears that western civilization is destructive, eastern civilisation is constructive.
('8', 320, 1, 10, 771318) Western civilization is centrifugal, eastern civilization is centripetal.
('8', 320, 1, 11, 771392) Western civilisation, therefore, is naturally disruptive, whereas eastern civilization combines.
('8', 320, 1, 12, 771489) I believe also that western civilization is without a goal, eastern civilization has always had the goal before it.
('8', 320, 1, 13, 771605) I do not mix up or confuse western civilization with Christian progress.
('8', 320, 1, 14, 771678) I decline to believe that it is a symbol of Christian progress that we have covered a large part of the globe with the telegraph system, that we have got telephones and ocean greyhounds, and that we have trains running at a velocity of 50 or even 60 miles per hour.
('8', 320, 1, 15, 771944) I refuse to believe that all this activity connotes Christian progress, but it does connote western civilization.
('8', 320, 1, 16, 772058) I think western civilization also represents tremendous activity, eastern civilization represents contemplativeness, but it also sometimes represents lethargy.
('8', 320, 1, 17, 772218) The people in India, the people in ChinaI leave Japan for the time beinghaving been sunk in their contemplative mood, have forgotten the essence of the thing, they have forgotten that, in transferring their activity from one sphere of life to another sphere of life, they had not to be idle, they had not to be lazy.
('8', 320, 1, 18, 772535) The result is that immediately they find an obstacle in their way, they simply sit down.
('8', 320, 1, 19, 772624) It is necessary that that civilization should come in contact with that of the West, it is necessary that thatcivilization should be quickened with the western spirit.
('8', 320, 1, 20, 772792) Immediately that fact is accomplished, I have no doubt also that the eastern civilization will become predominant, because it has a goal.
('8', 320, 1, 21, 772930) I think you will see easily that a civilization or a condition in which all the forces fly away from the centre must necessarily be without a goal, whereas those which converge to a point have always a goal.
('8', 320, 1, 22, 773138) It is then

('8', 321, 1, 2, 773248) necessary for these two civilizations to meet and we shall have a dif ferent force altogether, by no means a menacing force, by no means a force that disunites, but a force that unites.
('8', 321, 1, 3, 773434) The two forces are undou btedly opposing forces, but perhaps in the economy of nature both are necessary.
('8', 321, 1, 4, 773540) Only we, as intelligent human beings with heart and soul, have to see what those forces are, and have to use them, not blindly but intelligently, not anyhow and haphazard, but with a goal in view.
('8', 321, 1, 5, 773737) Immediately that is done, there is no difficulty whatsoever in [the] two civilizations meeting and meeting for a good purpose.
('8', 321, 1, 6, 773864) I have said that the African races have undoubtedly served the Empire, and I believe so have the Asiatic races or, rather, British Indians.
('8', 321, 1, 7, 774004) Have not the British Indians fought on many a battle field?
('8', 321, 1, 8, 774064) A people, moreover, who have religion as the basis of life, cannot be a menace.
('8', 321, 1, 9, 774144) And how can the African races be a menace?
('8', 321, 1, 10, 774187) They are still in the history of the worlds learners.
('8', 321, 1, 11, 774241) Able bodied and intelligent men as they are, they cannot but be an asset to the Empire.
('8', 321, 1, 12, 774329) I believe with Mr. Creswell that they ought not to be protected.
('8', 321, 1, 13, 774394) We do not want protection for them in any shape or form, but I do believe thisthat they are entitled to justice, a fair field and no favour.
('8', 321, 1, 14, 774535) Immediately you give that to them, you will find no difficulty.
('8', 321, 1, 15, 774599) Whilst, therefore, Asiatics and other Coloured people cannot be a menace, Asiatics at least have been made a menace in some Colonies.
('8', 321, 1, 16, 774733) We have been told that Natal and Mauritius are awful examples to every white man throughout the world.
('8', 321, 1, 17, 774836) I do not know that they are such awful countries, but I, at the same time, believe that, if what happened in Natal had not happened, it would have been differentwhether better or worse, we are not for the present discussing; but, if these countries have been ruined, they have been ruined purposely by white men, or, rather, by a few of them who were in a hurry to get rich.
('8', 321, 1, 18, 775211) If they had only bided their time and opportunity, no such thing need, would, have happened.
('8', 321, 1, 19, 775304) They did not hesitate to import indentured labour, which might be called semislave labour, from India.
('8', 321, 1, 20, 775407) Posterity has to pay for it.
('8', 321, 1, 21, 775436) If, therefore, Natal or Mauritius has suffered, it has suffered not from Asiatics as such, but from a system of labour of which Asiatics happened to form part.
('8', 321, 1, 22, 775596) Had there been white indentured labour instead, the result would have beenthe same.
('8', 321, 1, 23, 775680) It is not the free Indian population that can ever do any harm whatsoever to the Colonies.
('8', 321, 1, 24, 775771) But I do also admit that there are some reasonable complaints with reference to British Indians.
('8', 321, 1, 25, 775868) I venture, however, to submit that these complaints have no real basis.
('8', 321, 1, 26, 775940) It is complained that they live in dirty hovels.
('8', 321, 1, 27, 775989) Yes, some of them do.
('8', 321, 1, 28, 776011) They are said to live very cheaply.
('8', 321, 1, 29, 776047) But if you were to examine these complaints, I think, you would come to the conclusion that they could be dealt with very easily and very

('8', 322, 1, 2, 776230) effectively by municipal regulations.
('8', 322, 1, 3, 776268) There are many complaints against the people living in the East End of London by the people living in the West End, but no one has suggested that, therefore, the people in the East End should be swept away.
('8', 322, 1, 4, 776475) Sweep away the rack rent and the conditions prevailing in the East End, and its inhabitants will be just as good as those in the West End.
('8', 322, 1, 5, 776614) Similarly also, sweep away the conditions under which British Indians are called upon to live, sweep away the condition that they cannot own a patch of land which they can call their own, that they cannot live, and move, and have their being on Gods earth in South Africa with any degree of freedom, self respect and manliness, and they will realize that in Rome they must live as the Romans do, and will respond to every real and reasonable call that can be made upon them by the white man; but I ask you to be patient with them just as you would be patient with any fellow man.
('8', 322, 1, 6, 777194) Treat him as a real, live human being, and you will have no such thing as the Indian question in the country.
('8', 322, 1, 7, 777304) Please do not forget I do not advocate that there should be absolutely free immigration.
('8', 322, 1, 8, 777393) On the contrary, I have always said, and British Indians admit, that there may be regulation of immigration, but never based on colour.
('8', 322, 1, 9, 777529) Anyone who is accepted as an immigrant ought to be entitled to all the rights that a man who lives in the country should possess.
('8', 322, 1, 10, 777659) Whether he should have political rights or not is another question.
('8', 322, 1, 11, 777727) I am not here today to discuss the political question at all.
('8', 322, 1, 12, 777789) But there should be no two opinions as to whether he may live freely without being restricted, move freely without being restricted, own land, or trade honestly.
('8', 322, 1, 13, 777951) 1 British Indians and Englishmen have come together by Divine Providence.
('8', 322, 1, 14, 778025) I may add, and I believe it is true, that, when the British occupied India, it was not owing to humanitarian grounds, but that the act was selfish and often tinged with dishonesty.
('8', 322, 1, 15, 778206) But Natures ways are inscrutable.
('8', 322, 1, 16, 778240) She often unmakes what man makes and produces good out of evil.
('8', 322, 1, 17, 778304) Such is, in my opinion, the casewith the British connection with India.
('8', 322, 1, 18, 778376) I believe that the two races, the British and the Indian, have been brought together, not only for their own mutual advantage, but to leave an impress on the history of the world.
('8', 322, 1, 19, 778556) Believing that, I also believe that it is well for me to be a loyal subject of the Empire, but not I hope a member of a subject race.
('8', 322, 1, 20, 778690) I trust it is the mission of the English race, even where there are subject races, to raise them to equality with themselves, to give them free institutions and make them absolutely free men.
('8', 322, 1, 21, 778882) If that be the mission of the Empire, the mission of the British race, then is it not as well that the millions of human beings should be trained for

('8', 323, 3, 6, 779554) FOUL PLAY
('8', 323, 4, 7, 779564) This news letter deserves serious attention.
('8', 323, 4, 8, 779609) I said last week that the Government here wants to issue registers to fresh Indian entrants only under the obnoxious law.
('8', 323, 4, 9, 779731) 1 When I wrote that, I was quite sure that the Government would resile from its earlier position and allow the voluntary registration of Indians who, though they held permits, arrived after the 9th.
('8', 323, 4, 10, 779930) I find that my calculation has gone wrong.
('8', 323, 4, 11, 779973) Mr. Gandhi and General Smuts have been in correspondence, General Smuts categorically declaring in the end that Indians arriving after May 9 will be governed by the provisions of the obnoxious Act.
('8', 323, 4, 12, 780171) It was Hajee Habib who sent news from Pretoria that they intended to apply the obnoxious law [to fresh Indian entrants also].
('8', 323, 4, 13, 780297) Immediately on receipt of the information, a telegram was despatched, to which the following reply was received.
('8', 323, 5, 14, 780410) MESSAGE FROM GENERAL SMUTS
('8', 323, 6, 15, 780437) [I 2 am directed by the Government] to inform you by telegram that, since the persons who entered the Transvaal during the three month period were allowed to apply for voluntary registration, the terms of the settlement have been fulfilled.
('8', 323, 6, 16, 780678) Those who arrive after the period of three months will be obliged to take out registers under the law.
('8', 323, 6, 17, 780781) Mr. Gandhi then wrote the following letter 3 to General Smuts.
('8', 323, 6, 18, 780844) I sent you a telegram 4 with reference to a telegram from

('8', 324, 0, 1, 781096) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 325
('8', 324, 1, 2, 781141) Mr. Chamney.
('8', 324, 1, 3, 781154) I am sure you will be able to see from the letter addressed to you from gaol 1 that anyone coming in [after the expiry of the period of three months] should be entitled [to apply] for voluntary registration, provided he is otherwise eligible.
('8', 324, 1, 4, 781397) Mr. Chamneys refusal to permit voluntary registration [of this category of persons] has created a panic.
('8', 324, 1, 5, 781502) I hope that you will issue the necessary instructions, and permit voluntary registration of those who may now come in.
('8', 324, 2, 6, 781621) GENERAL SMUTS REPLY
('8', 324, 3, 7, 781641) General Smuts sent the following reply 2 to this: Your letter was duly received.
('8', 324, 3, 8, 781722) General Smuts does not agree with your interpretation of the terms of the settlement.
('8', 324, 3, 9, 781808) Indians who may come in now must apply for registration [under the law].
('8', 324, 3, 10, 781881) General Smuts hopes, therefore, that you will use your influence to persuade fresh Indian entrants to apply for registration accordingly.
('8', 324, 5, 11, 782019) In reply to this, Mr. Gandhi wrote as follows: 3
('8', 324, 6, 12, 782068) FURTHER REPLY FROM GENERAL SMUTS
('8', 324, 7, 13, 782101) This is as under: 4
('8', 324, 8, 14, 782121) Your letter was duly received.
('8', 324, 8, 15, 782152) Even after further consideration, General Smuts is unable to depart from the position he has taken.
('8', 324, 8, 16, 782252) This is a frightful reply, and suggests foul play.
('8', 324, 8, 17, 782303) It is not in itself a serious matter that a score or so of Indians who have recently retur ned from home are not allowed to take out certificates voluntarily.
('8', 324, 8, 18, 782462) That would not be a sufficient cause for panic.
('8', 324, 8, 19, 782510) What causes appre hension is that the roots of this go much deeper.
('8', 324, 8, 20, 782578) The obnoxious law has to be repealed now.
('8', 324, 8, 21, 782620) It must be repealed.
('8', 324, 8, 22, 782641) If it is not, the conse quences are likely to be unpleasant.
('8', 324, 8, 23, 782702) We shall remain where we were.
('8', 324, 8, 24, 782733) Mr. Gandhi wrote very frankly to General Smuts.
('8', 324, 8, 25, 782781) The brief reply to this letter merely announced that his demand would not be accepted.
('8', 324, 8, 26, 782868) Nothing was said about whether or not the law would be repealed.

('8', 325, 1, 2, 783220) INTERVIEW WITH CARTWRIGHT
('8', 325, 2, 3, 783246) Mr. Cartwright has been at every stage associated with the settlement as a mediator, so that there is no need to be apprehensive [on his score].
('8', 325, 2, 4, 783391) Since Mr. Cartwright is an honest man, we may depend on his doing his best.
('8', 325, 2, 5, 783467) What if, in spite of all, General Smuts does not come round?
('8', 325, 2, 6, 783528) The Transvaal Indians must answer this question to themselves courageously.
('8', 325, 2, 7, 783604) Mr. Gandhi has had an interview with Mr. Cartwright and the two of them intend to see General Smuts.
('8', 325, 2, 8, 783705) 1 Every thing will depend on the result of the interview.
('8', 325, 3, 9, 783763) WHAT IS THIS SETTLEMENT?
('8', 325, 4, 10, 783788) If, however, it is established that the Government has in fact played foul, one may ask what kind of a settlement this is.
('8', 325, 4, 11, 783911) But those who understand the meaning of satyagraha have no call to ask such a question.
('8', 325, 4, 12, 783999) In any settlement, whenever one of the parties proves untrue to its word, the fight has to be resumed.
('8', 325, 4, 13, 784102) The Indian community may thus have to resume the campaignwith this difference that we have now had three months respite [before doing that].
('8', 325, 4, 14, 784243) I believe we can fight now with increased strength and [therefore] more effectively.
('8', 325, 4, 15, 784328) The same satyagraha that yielded the settlement can also force its implementation.
('8', 325, 5, 16, 784411) TEST OF SATYAGRAHA
('8', 325, 6, 17, 784430) If the struggle is revived, satyagraha will be put to the test [again].
('8', 325, 6, 18, 784502) It will be all the more impressive and, if the Indian community proves resolute, a wonderful spectacle to watch.
('8', 325, 6, 19, 784615) This is no occasion for cowards, only for the brave.
('8', 325, 6, 20, 784668) One must be prepared to stake ones life on the campaign.
('8', 325, 6, 21, 784725) One must not look only to self interest, but should instead strive for the common good.
('8', 325, 6, 22, 784813) What do we own?
('8', 325, 6, 23, 784829) What did we bring with us [when we came into this world]?
('8', 325, 6, 24, 784887) What will we take back with us?
('8', 325, 6, 25, 784919) I, for one, wish to assert without reservation that we must look at the matter in this light, dedi cate our all to truth and draw once again the sword that has been returned to the scabbard.
('8', 325, 6, 26, 785110) Let us understand this and not blame the compromise.
('8', 325, 6, 27, 785163) After all, men do repudiate the written word and fight one another.
('8', 325, 6, 28, 785231) This is what has happened on this occasion.
('8', 325, 6, 29, 785275) There can be no guarantee against foul play.
('8', 325, 6, 30, 785320) Nor on that account can it be argued that we must never trust anyone for fear of being betrayed.
('8', 325, 6, 31, 785417) Moreover, when the gaol doors were thrown open, we could not

('8', 326, 1, 2, 785758) have got more than we did.
('8', 326, 1, 3, 785785) I place all these thoughts before Indian Opinion readers to alert everyone.
('8', 326, 1, 4, 785861) They will also know the difficulties that are being encountered and at the same time realize the value of voluntary registration.
('8', 326, 1, 5, 785991) I do not believe it will be necessary to resume the campaign.
('8', 326, 1, 6, 786053) [I believe] General Smuts will rectify his error and the Act will be repealed.
('8', 326, 1, 7, 786132) But we must prepare to act in case it is not repealed.
('8', 326, 1, 8, 786187) Let us note that the first warning has come from General Smuts himself.
('8', 326, 1, 9, 786259) The foregoing was written on Saturday.
('8', 326, 1, 10, 786298) I hope to be able to cover, in this news letter, further developments up to Wednesday.
('8', 326, 1, 11, 786385) [Before May 20, 1908]
('8', 326, 3, 12, 786407) Our only regret is that some Indians who have recently arrived from India have already submitted to the new law and taken out registration certificates.
('8', 326, 3, 13, 786560) They ought not to have been in such a hurry.
('8', 326, 3, 14, 786605) It is rather disheartening that there are Indians who, even after the big fight that was put up, have not learnt their duty.
('8', 326, 4, 15, 786730) WARNING
('8', 326, 5, 16, 786738) But I hope that no Indian will henceforth go to the Registration Office to take out certificates under the law.
('8', 326, 6, 17, 786850) MUNICIPAL BILL
('8', 326, 7, 18, 786865) The draft Municipal [Consolidation] Bill published in the Gazette confers the following powers on municipalities.
('8', 326, 7, 19, 786979) 1. To lay out Locations for Asiatics, and to transfer them from one site to another as may be deemed fit.
('8', 326, 7, 20, 787085) In case of such trans fer, compensation must be paid for losses on account of buildings.
('8', 326, 7, 21, 787174) 2. Municipalities may refuse to grant any licence which it is within their power to grant.
('8', 326, 7, 22, 787265) If a licence is refused, the applicant shall be entitled to appeal to a magistrate.
('8', 326, 7, 23, 787349) Licences can be withheld if the premises are unsatisfactory or the applicant has been previously con victed [three times within the three years immediately preceding his application].
('8', 326, 8, 24, 787533) 3. It will be entirely within the discretion of a municipality to grant or refuse a licence to a hawker.
('8', 326, 8, 25, 787638) In the event of refusal, there shall be no appeal against the decision of the municipality.
('8', 326, 8, 26, 787730) This means that hawkers will be at the mercy of the municipalities.

('8', 327, 2, 5, 788118) ASSAULT ON ESSOP MIA
('8', 327, 3, 6, 788139) At 2 P.M. on Sunday, Mr. Essop Mia, Chairman of the British Indian Association, was proceeding to the Location to attend a dinner party when a Pathan struck him on the back with a heavy stick.
('8', 327, 3, 7, 788332) He turned round and was hit on the face, the blow breaking the bridge of the nose.
('8', 327, 3, 8, 788415) Blood gushed out.
('8', 327, 3, 9, 788433) Mr. Essop Mia became unconscious and fell down.
('8', 327, 3, 10, 788481) Mr. Moosa Ebrahim Patel and Mr. Cachalia tried to seize the Pathan, the former receiving injuries in the attempt.
('8', 327, 3, 11, 788595) Meanwhile, Mr. Essop Mia got on his feet and took hold of the assailant.
('8', 327, 3, 12, 788668) Mr. Camay happened to come [on the scene] and whistled for the police, who rushed to the spot and arrested the assailant.
('8', 327, 3, 13, 788790) The other Pathans, who had struggled free, ran away.
('8', 327, 3, 14, 788843) Mr. Essop Mia was in severe pain.
('8', 327, 3, 15, 788877) He was bleeding.
('8', 327, 3, 16, 788894) Never theless, he went straight to the Police Station and then to Dr. Gilchrist.
('8', 327, 3, 17, 788975) The doctor bandaged him.
('8', 327, 3, 18, 789000) The nasal bone has been set, and it is expected that the setting will be successful.
('8', 327, 3, 19, 789085) The injury on the back, too, is severe.
('8', 327, 3, 20, 789125) The front teeth are shaky, but there is no reason to fear loss of the teeth.
('8', 327, 3, 21, 789202) Mr. Essop Mia has borne his pain with great courage.
('8', 327, 3, 22, 789255) Because of the injured nose, the upper part of his face is in bandage.
('8', 327, 3, 23, 789326) The mouth being left uncovered, he can talk a little.
('8', 327, 3, 24, 789380) A large number of persons called on him on Sunday.
('8', 327, 3, 25, 789431) The assault appears to have had something to do with the com promise.
('8', 327, 3, 26, 789501) The Pathans are believed to have picked on Mr. Essop Mia also for attack on account of the prominent part he played in that reg ard.
('8', 327, 3, 27, 789634) It is said, moreover, that the Pathans wished to be revenged on Mr. Essop Mia and did so for having given evidence about the attack on Mr. Gandhi.
('8', 327, 3, 28, 789781) If this is true, it is very much to be regretted.
('8', 327, 3, 29, 789831) It shows cowardice on the part of those among the Pathans who are the real instigators, who remain behind the scenes and operate through others.
('8', 327, 3, 30, 789976) Moreover, attacking a man for giving true evidence in the cause of justice betrays want of manliness.
('8', 327, 3, 31, 790078) I hope that all the Pathans do not subscribe to this way of thinking.
('8', 327, 3, 32, 790148) The wise among them owe it to themselves to pacify those inclined to mischief.
('8', 327, 3, 33, 790227) I do not think it particularly brave to raise ones

('8', 328, 1, 2, 790365) hand against an innocent person.
('8', 328, 1, 3, 790398) The Pathans are famous as soldiers.
('8', 328, 1, 4, 790434) They are known for their strong physique.
('8', 328, 1, 5, 790476) A soldier and a man of strength ought not to attack an unarmed person; on the contrary, he should defend such a one.
('8', 328, 1, 6, 790593) This much is plain.
('8', 328, 1, 7, 790613) Pitting oneself against an equal shows courage, but everyone will admit that it is not brave to attack from behind.
('8', 328, 1, 8, 790729) If the Pathans believe that they can terrorize the poor Indians, they are mistaken.
('8', 328, 1, 9, 790813) In the near future, if not today, the Indian commu nity will learn to be courageous and defend itself.
('8', 328, 1, 10, 790916) It is possible to defend oneself in two ways.
('8', 328, 1, 11, 790962) The better way is not to defend oneself at all and to accept blows with courage.
('8', 328, 1, 12, 791043) We see everywhere that the force we exert will be wasted if it does not meet with any resistance at all.
('8', 328, 1, 13, 791148) We know that, if we [try to] punch at the air, the arm will only feel a wrench.
('8', 328, 1, 14, 791228) No force is needed to bend a piece of string.
('8', 328, 1, 15, 791274) If we mistake it for a stick and use the same force as we would to bend the stick, we will only feel some discomfort in the arm.
('8', 328, 1, 16, 791403) If someone swears at me and I do not swear back, he will soon become silent, having exhausted himself.
('8', 328, 1, 17, 791506) The same is true of a man who uses violence to attack another.
('8', 328, 1, 18, 791569) It is my belief that this attitude and [the requisite] endurance cannot be cultivated in a day.
('8', 328, 1, 19, 791665) I think it requires more courage to bear up with violence to ones person [than to retaliate].
('8', 328, 1, 20, 791759) Till one acquires this kind of courage, it is necessary to cultivate the strength to defend oneself.
('8', 328, 1, 21, 791860) It is not difficult to defend oneself with a stick or in some other suitable fashion.
('8', 328, 1, 22, 791946) The important thing is to be fearless.
('8', 328, 1, 23, 791985) One must not live in fear of attack, and if one receives a blow,one must have the strength to strike back in self defence.
('8', 328, 1, 24, 792108) This calls for presence ofmind rather than strength.
('8', 328, 1, 25, 792161) We in India have become cowardly.
('8', 328, 1, 26, 792195) It is not courage to let ourselves be beaten up because of fear.
('8', 328, 1, 27, 792260) We do not even dare to raise the stick.
('8', 328, 1, 28, 792300) This is not right at all, and as long as this cowardice is not overcome, we shall not develop courage.
('8', 328, 1, 29, 792403) It is therefore my considered advice that, if we can develop real courage, we may suffer assault rather than turn away from our duty out of fear of violence.
('8', 328, 1, 30, 792561) If, however, such courage is beyond our reach, we must learn to keep the stick with us and be prepared to defend ourselves with it.
('8', 328, 1, 31, 792693) This is also part of satyagraha.
('8', 328, 1, 32, 792726) A satyagrahi will adhere to truth to the last.
('8', 328, 1, 33, 792773) If we want to be satyagrahis, we must have the courage to range ourselves against the Government or our own community, if necessary, and courage consists in being fearless.
('8', 328, 1, 34, 792946) We must be fearless
('8', 329, 0, 1, 792966) 330 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 329, 1, 2, 793008) about everything.
('8', 329, 1, 3, 793026) We must have no fear of violence to our person or of loss of money.
('8', 329, 1, 4, 793094) We may even lose the good opinion of others.
('8', 329, 1, 5, 793139) We may let everything go.
('8', 329, 1, 6, 793165) But we must not allow truth to forsake us.
('8', 329, 1, 7, 793208) This and this alone is fearlessness.
('8', 329, 1, 8, 793245) I know for certain that a large number of Pathans do not approve of acts of violence.
('8', 329, 1, 9, 793331) But they do not declare this in public, holding back again for fear of being themselves assaulted.
('8', 329, 1, 10, 793430) If these Pathans chance to read what I have written, I suggest to them that they also show true courage and declare in public that they do not approve of these things.

('8', 329, 4, 15, 793750) Mahomed Balim E/7512
('8', 329, 5, 16, 793771) These papers have been sent by Mr. Mahomed Balim to me.
('8', 329, 5, 17, 793827) I see that you have declined to consider the case on the strength of Acts 2 and 15 of 1907. May I, however, venture to place the special circu mstances of the case before you.
('8', 329, 5, 18, 794003) Mr. Mahomed Balim has been trying practically ever since 1905 to get permission to enter the Colony.
('8', 329, 5, 19, 794104) He is one of the very few British Indians who paid 25 as the price of his residence in the Transvaal before Law 3 of 1885 was amended.
('8', 329, 5, 20, 794239) He is very well known in theTransvaal and he can produce excellent references.

('8', 330, 2, 3, 794569) [JOHANNESBURG,] May 21, 1908
('8', 330, 3, 4, 794598) DEAR MR. SMUTS, I understand that you will be leaving for Cape Town on Saturday.
('8', 330, 3, 5, 794679) I hardly think that you realize the gravity of the situation so far as the Indian community is concerned.
('8', 330, 3, 6, 794785) Your decision 1 not to register under the compromise those Indians who have been entering the Colony on bona fide permits after the 9th of this month has created a turmoil amongst the Indians.
('8', 330, 3, 7, 794978) You have heard, I take it, that the Chairman of the Association has been already assaulted.
('8', 330, 3, 8, 795070) 2 Many more may be assaulted in the near future.
('8', 330, 3, 9, 795119) I daily receive indignant letters saying that I have entirely misled the people as to the compromise and that the law is not going to be repealed at all.
('8', 330, 3, 10, 795273) Can I not ask you, for the sake of those who have helped the Government, to do a very simple thing to announce immediately that the Act will be repealed and that new arrivals may be voluntarily registered?
('8', 330, 4, 11, 795479) The most violent member of the Pathan community, who has remained behind the scenes but who has been an active agent in having the assaults committed, has been arrested today on a charge of inspiring to do harm.
('8', 330, 4, 12, 795691) If it is at all possible, I certainly think that this man should be deported.
('8', 330, 4, 13, 795769) 4 In my opinion he is more or less a maniac and many dissatisfiedIndians simply hang around him.
('8', 330, 4, 14, 795866) The delay in making the announcement about the repeal of the Act and the decision not to accept voluntary registration have simply strengthened the hands of these men.
('8', 330, 4, 15, 796034) You will add to the peace of mind of well behaved Indians by giving the assurance about the Act, accepting voluntary registration from those who now arrive, and by dealing with

('8', 330, 5, 17, 796343) .the period of three months granted for voluntary registration having lapsed, further applications can only be received under the law.

('8', 330, 5, 19, 796655) .for reasons which Mr. Chamney has explained to you it is not possible to deal with him in the way you suggest, and added that General Smuts earnestly hoped that, if Gandhiji feared danger to his person, he should immediately avail himself of police protection.

('8', 331, 1, 4, 797137) This letter I have ventured to make very personal and absolutely frank.

('8', 331, 1, 6, 797253) I have been naturally talking to Mr. Cartwright, who has acted as the intermediary, and Mr. Cartwright has been passing along messages, but the gravity of the situation makes it imperative that I should make this very personal appeal to you.

('8', 331, 6, 12, 797673) MAGANLAL, I have received your letter.
('8', 331, 6, 13, 797712) You need not worry about me.
('8', 331, 6, 14, 797741) I think I shall have to sacrifice myself.
('8', 331, 6, 15, 797783) I do not believe that Smuts can play foul to the end.
('8', 331, 6, 16, 797837) But it gives an opportunity to those who have re ached the limits of their patience and are ready to strike at me.
('8', 331, 6, 17, 797952) If that should happen, we need not be unhappy.
('8', 331, 6, 18, 797999) If I have to give my life for a cause which I consider to be good, what better death can there be?
('8', 331, 6, 19, 798098) If God found it fit to take away Gokaldas, why should the ideaof death make us sorrowful?
('8', 331, 6, 20, 798188) This world is transient.
('8', 331, 6, 21, 798213) If, therefore, I leave this world, why should one be worried on that account?
('8', 331, 6, 22, 798291) It should be enough to wish that nothing improper is done by me as long as I live.
('8', 331, 6, 23, 798374) We should of course be careful that we do nothing improper even by mistake.
('8', 331, 6, 24, 798450) True, I have not yet reached the stage when I can attain liberation but I do believe that if I leave this body while treading the path along which my thoughtsare nowadays running, I shall be reborn and speedily attain to moksha at the end of that life.

('8', 332, 2, 3, 798912) The Transvaal Government have published a Draft Bill regu lating the Municipalities of the Transvaal.
('8', 332, 2, 4, 799014) General Smuts has fulfilled the promise he made at a meeting recently held, and to which ref erence has been made in these columns, that Municipalities will be armed with powers to deal with Asiatic traders.
('8', 332, 2, 5, 799222) There are sections in the Bill dealing with traders.
('8', 332, 2, 6, 799275) One section gives authority to the Muni cipalities to refuse trading licences on the grounds of insanitation, unsuitability of premises, and for other similar reasons, the decision being subject to revision by a Resident Magistrate.
('8', 332, 2, 7, 799508) Another section empowers Municipalities to refuse, among others, licences to hawkers, the refusal in these cases being in the absolute discretion of the Muni cipalities, no appeal being allowed.
('8', 332, 2, 8, 799703) The first section is not open to much objection, and Asiatics must take the consequences of the preva iling prejudices, except in so far as they may be met by appeal to magistrates.
('8', 332, 2, 9, 799885) But the second section is absolutely unjust, and is aimed at the large number of Asiatic hawkers.
('8', 332, 2, 10, 799983) Why there should be no appeal to the magistrates with reference to the licences covered by this section, it is difficult to understand.
('8', 332, 2, 11, 800119) Lord Elgin, when he occupied the position of Colonial Secretary, said that he would not allow the present rights of Asiatics to be infringed.
('8', 332, 2, 12, 800261) If, however, the Draft Bill goes through, and receives the Royal sanction, Asiatic trade must be ruined.
('8', 332, 2, 13, 800366) It is well to bear in mind that the livelihood of 5,000 Asiatic hawkers is at stake, as also of over 500 Asiatic store keepers.
('8', 332, 2, 14, 800494) Another section gives the Municipalities power to lay out Locations for Asiatics, which may be shifted from time to time, subject to compensation being paid to the residents for improvements made by them.
('8', 332, 2, 15, 800699) A further section gives the Municipalities power to regulate movement on foot paths.
('8', 332, 2, 16, 800784) Thus, the Bill would give the Municipalities a threefold power.
('8', 332, 2, 17, 800848) Asiatics should ultimately go to Locations.
('8', 332, 2, 18, 800892) They must not be allowed to walk on footpaths, and they must not continue their trade unhampered.
('8', 332, 2, 19, 800990) We trust that the Imperial Government, having had enough experience now during the last 16 months, will not allow such arbitrary powers to rest in the hands of the Transvaal Municipalities.

('8', 332, 4, 23, 801312) If we look for the reason for the assault, we find it has hardly any significance.
('8', 332, 4, 24, 801395) The assailant appears to be an
('8', 333, 0, 1, 801426) 334 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 333, 1, 2, 801468) altogether illiterate person.
('8', 333, 1, 3, 801498) The assault will bring discredit on the Indian community.
('8', 333, 1, 4, 801556) It proves that we are politically immature.
('8', 333, 1, 5, 801600) It is a sign of barbarism to resort to force in order to settle accounts.
('8', 333, 1, 6, 801674) We extend our sympathy to Mr. Essop Mia.
('8', 333, 1, 7, 801715) He has rendered the community great service.
('8', 333, 1, 8, 801760) The assault on him has added to the value of his service.
('8', 333, 1, 9, 801818) It is not surprising that such things should happen, for we are still novices.
('8', 333, 1, 10, 801897) We should learn to submit to violence for the sake of the community and truth.
('8', 333, 1, 11, 801976) We will have to learn even to die for it.
('8', 333, 1, 12, 802018) There may even be murders in the community.
('8', 333, 1, 13, 802062) But without such incidents, the community will not develop mettle; it will make no progress.
('8', 333, 1, 14, 802155) The tie of blood is a strong one indeed.
('8', 333, 1, 15, 802196) The man who dies for truth does not forsake service [of the cause] even at the moment of death, for it is our firm conviction that even after death his soul continues to serve.
('8', 333, 1, 16, 802373) It is according to this line of reasoning that we congratulate Mr. Essop Mia on his courage.
('8', 333, 1, 17, 802466) As for the misunderstanding that persists among the Pathans, we may point out to them that they have been overdoing things.
('8', 333, 1, 18, 802590) It will be well if there can be an end to this.

('8', 333, 3, 21, 802701) ROOTS OF TRUTH
('8', 333, 4, 22, 802716) I do not doubt the conclusions of the science of economics [if its premises are accepted].
('8', 333, 4, 23, 802807) If a gymnast formulated laws on the assumption that man is made only of flesh without a skeleton, those laws might well be valid, but they would not apply to man, since man has a skeleton.
('8', 333, 4, 24, 802996) In the same way, the laws of political economy may be valid but they cannot apply to man, who is subject to affections.
('8', 333, 4, 25, 803116) A physical culture expert may suggest that mans flesh be detached [from the skeleton], rolled into pellets, and then drawn out into cables.
('8', 333, 4, 26, 803256) He may then say that the re insertion of the skeleton will cause little inconvenience.
('8', 333, 4, 27, 803343) We should describe such a man as a madcap, for the laws of physical culture cannot be based on the separation of the skeleton from the flesh.
('8', 333, 4, 28, 803485) In the same manner, the laws of political economy which exclude human affections are of no use to man.
('8', 333, 4, 29, 803588) And yet the political economists of today behave exactly like the gymnastic instructor.
('8', 333, 4, 30, 803676) According to their mode of reasoning, man is a mere bodya machineand they base their laws on this assumption.
('8', 334, 0, 1, 803786) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 335
('8', 334, 1, 2, 803831) Though aware that man has a soul, they do not take it into account.
('8', 334, 1, 3, 803899) How can such a science apply to man, in whom the soul is the predominant element?
('8', 334, 1, 4, 803981) Every time there is a strike, we have a clean proof that economics is not a science, that it is worse than useless.
('8', 334, 1, 5, 804097) In such situations, the employers take one view of the matter, the workers another.
('8', 334, 1, 6, 804181) [Here] we cannot apply the laws of supply and demand.
('8', 334, 1, 7, 804235) Men rack their brains to prove that the interests of the employers and the employees are identical.
('8', 334, 1, 8, 804335) These men know nothing of such matters.
('8', 334, 1, 9, 804375) In fact, it does not always follow that because their worldly interests economic interestsare at variance men must be antagonistic to each other.
('8', 334, 1, 10, 804521) Let us suppose that the members of a family are starving.
('8', 334, 1, 11, 804579) The family consists of a mother and her children.
('8', 334, 1, 12, 804629) They have only one crust of bread between them.
('8', 334, 1, 13, 804677) All of them are hungry.
('8', 334, 1, 14, 804701) Here, the interests of the twoof the mother on the one hand, and the children on the otherare mutually opposed.
('8', 334, 1, 15, 804813) If the mother eats, the children will starve; if the children are fed, the mother will go hungry.
('8', 334, 1, 16, 804911) There is no hostility between the mother and the children for that reason; they are not antagonistic to one another.
('8', 334, 1, 17, 805028) Though the mother is the stronger, she does not eat up the bread.
('8', 334, 1, 18, 805094) The same is true of mens relations with one another.
('8', 334, 1, 19, 805147) Let us suppose that there is no difference between men and animals, and that we must fight like animals in pursuit of our respective interests 1. Even so we can lay down no general rule either way on whether or not the employer and the employee will always remain hostile to each other.
('8', 334, 1, 20, 805434) Their attitudes change with circumstances.
('8', 334, 1, 21, 805477) For instance, it is in the interest of both that work should be well and properly done and a just price obtained for it.
('8', 334, 1, 22, 805598) But in the division of profits, the gain of the one may or may not be the loss of the other.
('8', 334, 1, 23, 805691) It does not serve the employers interests to pay wages so low as to leave his men sickly and depressed.
('8', 334, 1, 24, 805795) Nor does it serve the workers interests to demand a high wage irrespective of whether the factory pays its way or not.
('8', 334, 1, 25, 805914) If the owner does not have enough money to keep the engine wheels in repair, it will obviously be wrong for the worker to demand full wages or to demand any wages at all.
('8', 334, 1, 26, 806085) We can thus see that we are not likely to succeed in constructing a science on the basis of the principle of supply and demand.

('8', 335, 0, 1, 806250) 336 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 335, 1, 2, 806292) never Gods intention that the affairs of men should be conducted on the principle of profit and loss.
('8', 335, 1, 3, 806394) Justice must provide the basis.
('8', 335, 1, 4, 806426) Man must give up, therefore, all thought of advancing his interests by following expediency regardless of moral considerations.
('8', 335, 1, 5, 806554) It is not always possible to predict with certainty the outcome of a given line of conduct.
('8', 335, 1, 6, 806646) But in most cases we can determine whether a certain act is just or unjust.
('8', 335, 1, 7, 806722) We can also assert that the result of moral conduct is bound to be good.
('8', 335, 1, 8, 806795) We cannot predict what that result will be, or how it will come about.
('8', 335, 1, 9, 806866) Justice includes affection.
('8', 335, 1, 10, 806894) The relation between master and operative depends on this element of affection.
('8', 335, 1, 11, 806974) Let us assume that the master wants to exact the utmost amount of work from his servant.
('8', 335, 1, 12, 807063) He allows him no time for rest, pays him a low wage, and lodges him in a garret.
('8', 335, 1, 13, 807144) In brief, he pays him a bare subsistence wage.
('8', 335, 1, 14, 807191) It may be argued that there is no injustice in all this.
('8', 335, 1, 15, 807248) The servant has placed all his time; at the masters disposal in return for a given wage, and the latter avails himself of it.
('8', 335, 1, 16, 807374) He determines the limits of hardship in exacting work by reference to what others do.
('8', 335, 1, 17, 807460) If the servant can get a better place, he is free to take it.
('8', 335, 1, 18, 807522) This is called economics by those who formulate the laws of supply and demand.
('8', 335, 1, 19, 807601) They assert that it isprofitable to the master thus to exact the maximum amount of work for the minimum wage.
('8', 335, 1, 20, 807711) In the long run, the entire society will benefit by it and, through the society, the servant himself.
('8', 335, 1, 21, 807813) But on reflection we find that this is not quite true.
('8', 335, 1, 22, 807868) This method of calculation would have been valid if the employee were a mere machine which required some kind of force to drive it.
('8', 335, 1, 23, 808000) But in this case the motive power of the servant is his soul, and soul force contradicts and falsifies all the calculations of the economists.
('8', 335, 1, 24, 808143) The machine that is man cannot be driven by the money fuel to do the maximum amount of work.
('8', 335, 1, 25, 808236) Man will give of his best only when his affections are brought into play.
('8', 335, 1, 26, 808310) The master servant nexus must not be a pecuniary one, but one of love.

('8', 336, 3, 6, 808644) E/2698/7 of the 22nd instant with reference to the introduction of minors.
('8', 336, 3, 7, 808719) If you will be good enough to let me have the names of the persons who have introduced minors, my Association will make careful inquiry and assist the Government to the utmost.
('8', 336, 3, 8, 808896) But I respectfully beg to point out that in so far as the British Indian community is concerned and in so far as the Asiatic Act quoted by you is concerned, in view of the fact that the part of the compact between the Government and the British Indian community that was applicable to the latter has been fulfilled, the Act is considered a dead letter and the British Indian community will consider it a breach of the compromise if the Act is enforced.
('8', 336, 3, 9, 809349) This does not mean that my Association wishes to encourage the entry of Asiatic minors who may have no right whatsoever to be in the country.
('8', 336, 3, 10, 809491) All that my Associationrespectfully submits is that Act 2 of 1907 cannot operate on the British Indian community, but that a new Act of a general character should cover attempts of the nature described in your letter.

('8', 337, 2, 3, 810002) [JOHANNESBURG,] May 26, 1908 THE HONBLE THE COLONIAL SECRETARY PRETORIA
('8', 337, 3, 4, 810074) SIR, Mr. Gandhi has just explained to me that it is the intention of the Government to legalize voluntary registration under the Asiatic Act and to make it applicable to Asiatics who have voluntarily regis tered, save for the penalties for non registration under it hitherto.
('8', 337, 3, 5, 810350) I beg to state that Mr. Gandhi, when, after the interviews with you, he explained the compromise to the British Indian community, gave a totally different version.
('8', 337, 3, 6, 810514) He declared emphatically before vast audi ences that, if the community represented by my Association accepted voluntary registration, the Asiatic Act would be repealed.
('8', 337, 3, 7, 810683) The news now given by Mr. Gandhi, therefore, comes to the British Indian com munity as a most disagreeable surprise.
('8', 337, 3, 8, 810800) The documents exchanged between you and Mr. Gandhi, in my humble opinion, also bear out the version given by the latter.
('8', 337, 3, 9, 810921) In this connection, I wish to draw the attention of the Govern ment to the fact that the leaders of the Asiatic community, with much personal risk to themselves, endeavoured throughout the last three months un ceasingly to help the Government to identify the British Indians resident in the Transvaal.
('8', 337, 3, 10, 811223) The least, therefore, that my Asso ciation had a right to expect was a scrupulous regard for the part of the compact to be carried out by the Government.
('8', 337, 3, 11, 811377) But, as I understand from Mr. Gandhi, you have irrevocably taken the step and stated that the new legislation that is to be passed will be merely to legalize registration under the Asiatic Act.
('8', 337, 3, 12, 811571) It will be the duty of my Association, therefore, again most relu ctantly to take up the position that it occupied three months ago.
('8', 337, 3, 13, 811704) My Association is advising British Indians in the Transvaal to withdraw their applications for voluntary registration and all documents lodged with Mr. Chamney.
('8', 337, 3, 14, 811865) This was an act done by the community as a matter of grace and in order to show the Government its complete bona fides.
('8', 337, 3, 15, 811985) It is impossible for the community to do otherwise than what I have above indicated, for the simple reason that it was never the intention to submit to an Act which the community was bound by a solemn obligation not to accept and moreover to strive to resist.
('8', 337, 3, 16, 812245) In conclusion, I venture respectfully to point out that the depar

('8', 338, 1, 2, 812357) ture by the Government from the original intention and undertaking given to the Asiatic community through Mr. Gandhi and his co signa tories is a most unfortunate event and likely to intensify the feelings of suspicion among the Asiatic races inhabiting the Colony, and, as I deem myself a citizen of this country, it hurts me to think that those who are in authority and who govern this country in my name should have little regard for solemn obligations.

('8', 338, 6, 7, 813028) COLONIAL OFFICE PRETORIA
('8', 338, 7, 8, 813053) DEAR SIR, I beg to apply formally for a return of my application for voluntary registration and all the papers given by me to you in connection with the matter, for the following reasons.
('8', 338, 7, 9, 813241) I have just learnt that it is the definite intention of the Government to legalize voluntary registration under the Asiatic Act making the Act applicable to such Asiatics in every other respect.
('8', 338, 7, 10, 813436) This I consider to be a distinct breach of the compact arrived at between the Government and the Asiatic communities of the Transvaal.
('8', 338, 7, 11, 813571) General Smuts told me at the interview at which you were present that, if the compact on the part of the Asiatic communities was carried out, he would repeal the Act.
('8', 338, 7, 12, 813738) This, as you are aware, was in answer to my letter 1 of the 1st February last, asking for a definite assurance on the matter.
('8', 338, 7, 13, 813864) I claim that the Asiatics have more than fulfilled their part of the contract.
('8', 338, 7, 14, 813943) It was, therefore, the Governments duty to declare their intention to repeal the Act.
('8', 338, 7, 15, 814029) Moreover, the letter
('8', 338, 8, 16, 814050) 1Vide Letter to General Smuts, 1 2 1908
('8', 339, 0, 1, 814090) 340 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 339, 1, 2, 814132) accepted by General Smuts shows clearly that the Act was in no case to apply to those who might be voluntarily registered.
('8', 339, 1, 3, 814255) Thedraft letter placed before the prisoners read that to all who so register the penalties of the Act be not applied.
('8', 339, 1, 4, 814373) 1 Knowing what I was doing, I deliberately struck off the words the penalties of in order that, even if the bulk of the Asiatics did not accept the compromise, those who did so might in any case be exempted from it entirely.
('8', 339, 1, 5, 814598) 2 In proposing to legalize voluntary registration under the Act, therefore, General Smuts not only departs from the promise made by him to me but also from his acceptance of the letter above quoted.
('8', 339, 1, 6, 814797) The decision of the Government not to accept voluntary registration from the domiciled Asiatics now returning from Asia also means, in my opinion, a breach of the spirit of the compromise if not of its letter.
('8', 339, 1, 7, 815007) This unfortunate decision shows that the General has failed entirely to appreciate the essence of the late struggle now about to be revived.
('8', 339, 1, 8, 815148) It was never to obtain individual rights but to preserve and assert the communal rights and self respect of Asiatics.
('8', 339, 1, 9, 815266) Under the circumstances, there is no course left open to me but the one I have now adopted.
('8', 339, 1, 10, 815358) I am once more prepared, as a loyal citi zen, to submit to the punishments involved in non submission to the Asiatic Act.
('8', 339, 1, 11, 815480) The compromise was never accepted by me or my fellow workers to escape personal hardships but to show the reasonableness of our struggle.
('8', 339, 1, 12, 815618) I propose to ask my brother Asiatics to follow the same course that I have adopted.
('8', 339, 1, 13, 815702) You will, I have no doubt, perceive the gravity of the situation and comply with my request on or before Friday next.
('8', 339, 1, 14, 815820) 3 This gives you time, should you desire it, to consult General Smuts by wire as to my letter.
('8', 339, 1, 15, 815915) I am sure you will see that you have no legal right to the docu ments, including the application, possessed by you and which were given to you only as a matter of grace, and not in virtue of any law.

('8', 340, 3, 5, 816586) COLONIAL OFFICE PRETORIA
('8', 340, 4, 6, 816611) DEAR SIR, Mr. Gandhi has informed me that it is the intention of the Government to legalize voluntary registration under the Asiatic Act and to apply that Act to voluntary registrants in every respect, except that they will not be subject to the penalty for not having complied with it hitherto.
('8', 340, 4, 7, 816907) That is not how the compromise was explained to me and my Society by Mr. Gandhi.
('8', 340, 4, 8, 816988) He, on returning from General Smuts on Thursday night, the 30th January last, and on returning from General Smuts on the 3rd February last, emphatically assured huge audiences of Indians that, if the Asiatic communities carried out their part of the contract of voluntarily offering to register, the Asiatic Act would be repealed.2 I, for one, would never have accepted a compromise on any other basis, much less that of having to submit to the Asiatic Act under any conceivable circumstances.
('8', 340, 4, 9, 817482) I was bound before the compromise, as I am bound now, by a solemn obligation not to submit to the Act for reasons I need not now go into, except onethat I, as Chairman of the Hamidia Islamic Society, would be totally unworthy to retain that position if I ever accepted an Act which puts an unwarranted affront on Turkish Mahomedans.
('8', 340, 4, 10, 817815) I must, therefore, ask you kindly to return to me my voluntary registration application form filled in by me and other documents in your possession.
('8', 340, 4, 11, 817964) I have read the letter 2 addressed to you by Mr. Gan dhi, and I associate myself entirely with the contents thereof.
('8', 340, 4, 12, 818081) Should the Government at any time wish to carry out both to the letter and in the spiritthe compact with the Asiatic communities, I will be pleased to return the documents.

('8', 341, 4, 7, 818653) DEAR SIR, I understand from Mr. Gandhi that it is the intention of the Government not to carry out the contract come to with the Asiatic communities.
('8', 341, 4, 8, 818803) I am fully aware of the contents of the letter signed by me in conjunction with Messrs Gandhi and Naidoo, and it was explained sufficiently that the Act was never to apply to those who registered themselves voluntarily.
('8', 341, 4, 9, 819023) The only reason we accepted the compromise was in order to bring about the repeal of the Asiatic Act, and of that I and my fellow prisoners were sure, because we were sure of the honesty of the community to which I have the honour to belong and, therefore, also that voluntary registration would be gladly accepted by the people.
('8', 341, 4, 10, 819353) I have now to ask you to be kind enough to return my voluntary application form as also other documents in your possession; and, should the Government ever intend to carry out the compact come to with the Asiatic communities through General Smuts, I shall be pleased to return the documents.
('8', 341, 4, 11, 819645) I have read Mr. Gandhis letter addressed to you, and I associate myself entirely with the sentiments expressed therein.

('8', 342, 2, 3, 820042) The reader should think about the letter from Mr. Shakur Ismail of Rhodesia which we published last week.
('8', 342, 2, 4, 820148) 1 The Colonial Government wants to enact a law similar to the one in the Transvaal.
('8', 342, 2, 5, 820232) If it does, that will be a frightful thing indeed!
('8', 342, 2, 6, 820283) The Indians in Rhodesia must offer battle.
('8', 342, 2, 7, 820326) They are justified in expecting help from other quarters in case they are forced to fight, and we are convinced that, if they resort to satyagraha, they will also get help from all the Colonies [as the Trans vaal Indians did].
('8', 342, 2, 8, 820553) Let us hope that they will not have to take that step.
('8', 342, 2, 9, 820608) However, whether or not a new law is passed, their problems deserve some attention.
('8', 342, 2, 10, 820692) Even educated persons are refused entry [into that Colony] if they are unemployed.
('8', 342, 2, 11, 820775) If they can produce evidence of having found employment, the excuse is then advanced that the employment is unsatisfactory.
('8', 342, 2, 12, 820899) In the result, the Indians are deprived of the benefits under the existing law.
('8', 342, 2, 13, 820979) It is possible to fight against this [state of affairs] by legal means.
('8', 342, 2, 14, 821051) To be able to do that, they should consult a good lawyer in Rhodesia.
('8', 342, 2, 15, 821121) Apparently, difficulties also exist as regards trading licences.
('8', 342, 2, 16, 821186) It must be borne in mind, however, that not many Indians will be able to enter [any of the South African] Colonies in the immediate future.
('8', 342, 2, 17, 821326) Licences will not be issued freely.
('8', 342, 2, 18, 821362) In the long run, however, Indians may be able to migrate to all the Colonies and also carry on trade.
('8', 342, 2, 19, 821464) How soon this will happen will depend on Indians settled abroad.
('8', 342, 2, 20, 821529) For this purpose, it is necessary that they should remain honest and obs erve sanitary and other regulations.
('8', 342, 2, 21, 821639) It is also necessary that they hold up their heads as free men and do not submit to anything which may betoken cowardice.
('8', 342, 2, 22, 821761) Translations 2 of articles, which we publish [this
('8', 342, 3, 23, 821812) 1 In his letter to the British Indian Association, Ismail, President of the Association of Rhodesia Indians, appealed for help.
('8', 342, 3, 24, 821940) The letter mentions the following disabilities of Indians in Southern Rhodesia: (1) Although the immigration rules entitled educated Asiatics who could give satisfactory evidence of employment to enter the Colony, their employment was in practice held unsatisfactory; (2) no legal provision existed to safeguard the rights of those already resident in Rhodesia or those who wished to return after a temporary absence.
('8', 342, 3, 25, 822358) A deputation to the Administrator at Salisbury failed to secure relief.
('8', 342, 3, 26, 822430) A draft Ordinance, which was largely similar to the Transvaal legislation and sought to restrict Asiatic immigration, had been published in the Gazette.
('8', 342, 3, 27, 822583) Simultaneously, another Ordinance to regulate the trade of general dealers and hawkers was published.
('8', 342, 3, 28, 822685) This vested the power to grant licences in municipalities and sanitary boards.
('8', 342, 3, 29, 822764) Licences could be issued only to those holding certificates under the Registration Ordinance.

('8', 343, 1, 7, 823277) Thus, Indians in different parts of the world are waking up.

('8', 343, 4, 12, 823575) BEGINNING OF SATYAGRAHA
('8', 343, 5, 13, 823599) I said last week that General Smuts might play foul.
('8', 343, 5, 14, 823652) It has now been proved that there has been foul play.
('8', 343, 5, 15, 823706) It is known for certain that he has no intention of repealing the obnoxious Act.
('8', 343, 5, 16, 823787) The Government has not yet made the news public, but it has spread in the Indian community, and everyones blood is up.
('8', 343, 5, 17, 823906) It would appear that the campaign has had a good beginning.
('8', 343, 5, 18, 823966) We shall now get to know all about voluntary and compulsory [registration].
('8', 343, 5, 19, 824042) Mr. Essop Mia has addressed the following letter 2 to the Government.
('8', 343, 6, 20, 824112) LETTER TO CHAMNEY
('8', 343, 7, 21, 824130) Mr. Gandhi has written the following letter 3 to Mr. Chamney.

('8', 343, 9, 23, 824218) Mr. Imam Abdool Kadir Bawazeer has written to Mr. Chamney as follows: 4
('8', 343, 10, 24, 824290) Mr. Gandhi has informed [me] that it is the Governments intention to legalize voluntary registration under the Asiatic [Registration] Act.
('8', 343, 10, 25, 824429) While explaining the compromise Mr. Gandhi had stated emphatically that, if the Indian community took out registers voluntarily, the Government would repeal the

('8', 344, 0, 1, 824820) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 345
('8', 344, 1, 2, 824865) Since the Act will now not be repealed, it is impossible for me to submit to it.
('8', 344, 1, 3, 824946) If I submit to a law which I am bound by a solemn obligation tooppose and which puts an affront upon Turkish Mahomedans, I shall be totally unworthy of the position I hold.
('8', 344, 1, 4, 825119) Kindly, therefore, return the application form filled in by me immediately along with the other documents.
('8', 344, 1, 5, 825226) I have read Mr. Gandhis letter 1 [to you] and I associate myself entirely with its contents.
('8', 344, 1, 6, 825319) In addition to this, Mr. Naidoo and Mr. Quinn have supported Mr. Gandhis stand on the compromise as stated in his letter, and asked for the return of their documents.
('8', 344, 1, 7, 825486) About a hundred other Indians have also written to Mr. Chamney asking him to return their applications and other documents to the Secretary of the Association.
('8', 344, 2, 8, 825646) WHAT THIS MEANS
('8', 344, 3, 9, 825662) I think this decision to withdraw the [earlier] applications is likely to make a strong impression on Mr. Smuts.
('8', 344, 3, 10, 825775) If the Government refuses to return the documents, I think it should be possible to take legal action.
('8', 344, 3, 11, 825878) General Smuts will find it extremely difficult to returnthe documents.
('8', 344, 3, 12, 825949) It will not do to refuse them.
('8', 344, 3, 13, 825980) Equally, to return them will mean loss of face [for the Government].
('8', 344, 3, 14, 826049) But this will enable us to realize how much voluntary registration really means.
('8', 344, 3, 15, 826130) If it had been a case of compulsory registration, it would have been impossible to ask for the applications to be returned.
('8', 344, 3, 16, 826254) I feel that the campaign will lead to a decision within a few days.
('8', 344, 3, 17, 826322) Meanwhile, no Indian must so much as mention the Permit Office for the present at any rate.
('8', 344, 3, 18, 826414) Those who wish to enter the Transvaal should postpone their plans for the present.
('8', 344, 3, 19, 826497) It may be necessary to hold meetings in other parts of South Africa with a view to helping the Transvaal Indians.
('8', 344, 3, 20, 826611) Whether the good offices of Sir George Farrar and other gentlemen should be sought is being considered.
('8', 344, 3, 21, 826715) This issue is likely to be raised in the English papers next week.
('8', 344, 3, 22, 826782) We ought to wait for the reply to the notices mentioned above before discussing the subject in public.
('8', 344, 3, 23, 826885) Now that the struggle has been resumed, every Indian must realize that it is directed against the Act, and that all the emphasis should accordingly be on this point.
('8', 344, 3, 24, 827051) We use the argument about finger impressions and thumb impressions [to explain our campaign], but that only subserves the issue of the law itself.
('8', 344, 3, 25, 827198) Just now, we should

('8', 345, 0, 1, 827256) 346 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 345, 1, 2, 827298) not even affix our signatures even under the law.
('8', 345, 2, 3, 827348) WHAT SHOULD WE DEMAND NOW ?
('8', 345, 3, 4, 827376) If the Government gives a non committal reply to these notices thus nullifying voluntary registration, and if all the Indians take the field again as satyagrahis, in any settlement that may follow, we shall not be bound by anything that we undertook to do earlier.
('8', 345, 3, 5, 827641) Earlier we had bound ourselvesto register voluntarily.
('8', 345, 3, 6, 827696) We made the offer of voluntary registration to prove our bona fides.
('8', 345, 3, 7, 827765) Now these have been established for the most part.
('8', 345, 3, 8, 827816) We can therefore raise our demands when a fresh settlement is negotiated.
('8', 345, 3, 9, 827890) To my mind we shall be justi fied in advancing the following demands: (1) Those who hold valid registers from the Dutch period should be entitled to register voluntarily.
('8', 345, 3, 10, 828061) (2) Those who have entered openly, but with permits, and have lived here for some time should be entitled to registration certificates.
('8', 345, 3, 11, 828197) (3) Those who can prove to the satisfaction of a court that they are refugees should be permitted to enter.
('8', 345, 3, 12, 828305) (4) No laws should be enacted to deprive a subject of his personal liberty exclusively on the basis of the colour of his skin.
('8', 345, 3, 13, 828432) (5) Educated Indians should be allowed to come in even if they are fresh entrants.
('8', 345, 3, 14, 828515) I do not think our campaign will reach a stage when we will be able to put forward these demands.
('8', 345, 3, 15, 828613) Be that as it may, the struggle that has now been resumed cannot but be advantageous to the Indian community.
('8', 345, 4, 16, 828723) MEETING OF BRITISH INDIAN ASSOCIATION COMMITTEE
('8', 345, 5, 17, 828771) A meeting of the Committee was held on Wednesday.
('8', 345, 5, 18, 828821) Mr. Gan dhis office was crowded to capacity.
('8', 345, 5, 19, 828866) Mr. Essop Mia attended the meeting with a gum plaster on his nose and took the chair.
('8', 345, 5, 20, 828952) Mr. Gan dhi explained the position at length.
('8', 345, 5, 21, 828998) 1 The steps already taken as indi cated above were approved.
('8', 345, 5, 22, 829059) Everyone agreed that the satyagraha cam paign should be resumed.

('8', 345, 7, 24, 829140) The following letter has been circulated to all [the Town com mittees] in the Transvaal.
('8', 345, 7, 25, 829229) It is now certain that the Government will go back on its word about voluntary registration and the new law.
('8', 345, 7, 26, 829338) Ignoring his

('8', 346, 1, 2, 829461) written assurance, General Smuts has stated that the proposed Bill will only legalize voluntary registration that has taken place under the new Act.
('8', 346, 1, 3, 829610) To exploit voluntary registration in this manner is plainly foul play.
('8', 346, 1, 4, 829681) General Smuts now wants to gull us by putting a wrong construction on the promise which he gave in writing.
('8', 346, 1, 5, 829789) We need not be alarmed by this double crossing.
('8', 346, 1, 6, 829837) Since our cause is just, we have reason to believe that this double crossing can only be to our advantage, if anything.
('8', 346, 1, 7, 829957) It is neces sary now to resort to satyagraha.
('8', 346, 1, 8, 830003) As a first step in the campaign, every Indian should write a letter requesting that the application made by him voluntarily be returned.
('8', 346, 1, 9, 830140) He should ask for the application and the other documents to be returned to him, or sent to the Association.
('8', 346, 1, 10, 830249) I attach herewith a specimen letter 1. Here, everyone is in high spirits and prepared to resume the fight.
('8', 346, 1, 11, 830356) Ask everyone there to keep up their courage.
('8', 346, 1, 12, 830401) For the pre sent, no one must correspond with the Permit Office or even ask for registers 2, etc.
('8', 346, 1, 13, 830499) Those without licences should continue their business fearlessly after tendering the licence fee.
('8', 346, 1, 14, 830597) Those who are prosecuted under the new law will be defe nded by Mr. Gandhi free of charge, exactly as was done earlier.
('8', 346, 2, 15, 830717) It should be assumed that all of us are again without regis ters.
('8', 346, 3, 16, 830783) ESSOP MIA
('8', 346, 4, 17, 830793) Mr. Essop Mia is improving rapidly.
('8', 346, 4, 18, 830829) He can now sit up in a chair.
('8', 346, 4, 19, 830859) He has a gum plaster on his nose and the wound troubles him a little.
('8', 346, 4, 20, 830929) The arm and other parts of the body where he was injured still hurt.
('8', 346, 4, 21, 830998) A large number of persons call on him every day to ask after his health.
('8', 346, 4, 22, 831071) He is now able to converse with them fairly comfortably.
('8', 346, 4, 23, 831128) Mr. Phillips and Mr. Doke have been to see him a few times.
('8', 346, 4, 24, 831188) He has also been receiving letters of sympathy from a number of towns.

('8', 347, 1, 2, 831586) 191. SARVODAYA [ III]
('8', 347, 2, 3, 831608) ROOTS OF TRUTH
('8', 347, 3, 4, 831623) It usually happens that, if the master is a man of sense and energy, the servant works hard enough, under pressure; it also happens that, if the master is indolent and weak, the performance of the servant is not of the best in quality or quantity.
('8', 347, 3, 5, 831871) But the true law is that, if we compare two masters of equal intelligence, the servant of the one who is sympathetically inclined will work better than that of the other who is not so inclined.
('8', 347, 3, 6, 832065) It may be argued that this principle does not quite hold, since kindness and indulgence are sometimes rewarded with their oppo sites.
('8', 347, 3, 7, 832199) The servant becomes unmanageable.
('8', 347, 3, 8, 832233) But the argument is never thelessinvalid.
('8', 347, 3, 9, 832275) A servant who rewards kindness with negligence will become vengeful when treated harshly.
('8', 347, 3, 10, 832365) A servant who is dishonest to a liberal master will be injurious to an unjust one.
('8', 347, 3, 11, 832448) Therefore, in any case and with any person, this unselfish treat ment will yield the most effective return.
('8', 347, 3, 12, 832556) We are here considering affections only as a motive power.
('8', 347, 3, 13, 832615) That we should be kind because kindness is good is quite another consideration.
('8', 347, 3, 14, 832695) We are not thinking of that for the present.
('8', 347, 3, 15, 832740) We only want to point out here that not only are the ordinary laws of economics, which we considered above, rendered nugatory by the motive power of kindnesssympathybut also that affection, being a power of an altogether different kind, is inconsonant with the laws of economics and can survive only if those laws are ignored.
('8', 347, 3, 16, 833067) If the master is a calculating person who shows kind ness only in expectation of a return, he will probably be disappointed.
('8', 347, 3, 17, 833192) Kindness should be exercised for the sake of kindness; the reward will then come unsought.
('8', 347, 3, 18, 833283) It is said that he who loses his life shall find it, and he who finds it shall lose it.
('8', 347, 4, 19, 833371) Let us take the example of a regiment and its commander.
('8', 347, 4, 20, 833428) If a general seeks to get his troops to work in accordance with the principles of economics, he will fail.
('8', 347, 4, 21, 833535) There are many instances of generals cultivating direct, personal relations with their men, treating them with kindness, sharing their joys and hardships, ensuring their safetyin brief, treating them with sympathy.
('8', 347, 4, 22, 833750) A general of this kind will be able to exact the most arduous work from his troops.
('8', 347, 4, 23, 833834) If we look into history, we shall rarely find a battle won where the troops had no love for their general.
('8', 347, 4, 24, 833941) Thus the bond of sympathy between the
('8', 347, 5, 25, 833979) 1 St. Matthew, Ch. X, v.
('8', 348, 0, 1, 834004) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 349
('8', 348, 1, 2, 834049) general and his troops is the truest force.
('8', 348, 1, 3, 834093) Even a band of robbers has the utmost affection for its leader.
('8', 348, 1, 4, 834157) And yet we find no such intimate relation between the employer and the employees in textile mills and other factories.
('8', 348, 1, 5, 834276) One reason for this is that, in these factories, the wages of the employees are determined by the laws of supply and demand.
('8', 348, 1, 6, 834401) Between the employer and the employee there obtains, therefore, the relation of disaffection rather than of affection, and instead of sympathy between them we find antagonism.
('8', 348, 1, 7, 834577) We have then to consider two questions: one, how far the rate of wages may be so regulated as not to vary with the demand for labour; second, how far workmen can be maintained in factories, without any change in their numbers irrespective of the state of trade, with the same bond [between workmen and employer] as obtains between servants and master in an old family, or between soldiers and their commander.
('8', 348, 1, 8, 834987) Let us consider the first question.
('8', 348, 1, 9, 835023) It is surprising why econo mists do nothing to make it possible for standards of payment for factoryworkers to be fixed.
('8', 348, 1, 10, 835144) We see, on the other hand, that the office of the Prime Minister of England is not put up to auction, but that whoever the incumbent, the remuneration remains the same.
('8', 348, 1, 11, 835313) Nor do we offer the job of a priest to anyone who agrees to accept the lowest salary.
('8', 348, 1, 12, 835399) With physicians and lawyers, too, we do not generally deal in this manner.
('8', 348, 1, 13, 835474) Thus we observe that in these instances a certain standard of payment is fixed.
('8', 348, 1, 14, 835554) It may be asked, however, whether a good work man and a bad one must both be paid the same wage.
('8', 348, 1, 15, 835651) In fact, that is as it should be.
('8', 348, 1, 16, 835685) In the result, the rate of wages for all workers being the same, we shall engage only a good bricklayer or carpenter as we go only to a good physician or lawyerthe fees of all physicians or law yers being the same.
('8', 348, 1, 17, 835900) That is the proper reward of the good work manto be chosen.
('8', 348, 1, 18, 835960) Therefore, the right system respecting all labour is that it should be paid at fixed rates.
('8', 348, 1, 19, 836052) Where a bad workman finds it possible to deceive employers by accepting a low wage, the eventual outcome cannot but be bad.
('8', 348, 1, 20, 836176) Let us now consider the second point.
('8', 348, 1, 21, 836214) It is that, whatever the state of trade, the factories must maintain the same number of workers in employment.
('8', 348, 1, 22, 836325) When there is no security of employment, the workers are obliged to ask for higher wages.
('8', 348, 1, 23, 836415) If, however, they can be assured of continued employment for life, they will be prepared to work for very low wages.
('8', 348, 1, 24, 836532) It is clear therefore that the employer who assures sec urity of employment to his workers will find it profitable in the long run.
('8', 348, 1, 25, 836664) The employees also stand to gain if they continue steadily in the
('8', 349, 0, 1, 836730) 350 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 349, 1, 2, 836772) same job.
('8', 349, 1, 3, 836782) Large profits are not possible in factories run on these lines.
('8', 349, 1, 4, 836846) Big risks cannot be taken.
('8', 349, 1, 5, 836873) Gambling on a large scale will not be possible.
('8', 349, 1, 6, 836921) The soldier is ready to lay down his life for the sake of his commander.
('8', 349, 1, 7, 836994) That is why the work of a soldier is considered more honourable than that of an ordinary worker.
('8', 349, 1, 8, 837091) The soldiers trade is really, not slaying, but being slain in defence of others.
('8', 349, 1, 9, 837172) Anyone who enlists as a soldier holds his life at the service of the state.
('8', 349, 1, 10, 837248) This is true also of the lawyer, the physician and the priest.
('8', 349, 1, 11, 837311) That is why we look up to them with respect.
('8', 349, 1, 12, 837356) A lawyer must do justice even at the cost of his life.
('8', 349, 1, 13, 837411) The physician must treat his patients at the cost of incon venience to himself.
('8', 349, 1, 14, 837491) And the clergyman must instruct his congreg ation and direct it along the right path, regardless of consequences.

('8', 349, 3, 17, 837679) [JOHANNESBURG] THE EDITOR INDIAN OPINION
('8', 349, 4, 18, 837720) SIR, Though everyone knows that I write a great deal for the Gujarati section of this journal, it is rarely that I do so under my signature.
('8', 349, 4, 19, 837861) Here is another occasion for me to write under my name.
('8', 349, 5, 20, 837917) When I saw Mr. Cartwright last Saturday, he showed me Mr. Smuts letter in which he has said that the proposed Bill was intended only to legalize voluntary registration.
('8', 349, 5, 21, 838086) The Bill will provide for Indians who have taken out registers voluntarily to be exempted from the penalties in the new law for breach of its provisions.
('8', 349, 5, 22, 838240) For all the other purposes, they too will be subject to that law.
('8', 349, 5, 23, 838306) This is double crossing, pure and simple.
('8', 349, 5, 24, 838348) Though not dead yet, we are as good as dead.
('8', 349, 5, 25, 838393) This need not be so, however, if our cause is just.
('8', 349, 5, 26, 838445) The law, it was said, was sure to be annulled.
('8', 349, 5, 27, 838492) What has happe ned to all that talk?
('8', 349, 5, 28, 838529) What has come of Mr. Gandhis words?
('8', 349, 5, 29, 838565) What will he have to say for himself now?
('8', 349, 5, 30, 838607) How will he face the Indians? I hear

('8', 350, 1, 2, 838848) those questions echoing in my ears.
('8', 350, 1, 3, 838884) Even now I say that the law will be repealed, provided the Indian community carries through the satyagraha campaign.
('8', 350, 1, 4, 839001) I stand by my words.
('8', 350, 1, 5, 839022) There is no reason for me to feel so ashamed that I cannot face my brethren.
('8', 350, 1, 6, 839099) I need be ashamed if I myself betray the cause.
('8', 350, 1, 7, 839147) There is nothing that can be gained through deception.
('8', 350, 1, 8, 839202) Neither will Mr. Smuts gain anything thereby.
('8', 350, 1, 9, 839248) It is undoubtedly true, as I said earlier, that there exists a written document.
('8', 350, 1, 10, 839329) 1 If Mr. Smuts chooses to give a perverse reply about this letter, that does not prove that I was to blame [for having agreed to the compromise in the first instance].
('8', 350, 1, 11, 839497) I remember the warning given by a large number of Indians and whites.
('8', 350, 1, 12, 839567) They told me not to trust General Smuts.
('8', 350, 1, 13, 839608) I trusted him up to a point.
('8', 350, 1, 14, 839637) There is nothing else one could have done.
('8', 350, 1, 15, 839680) That is how political affairs always have been, and will be, conducted.
('8', 350, 1, 16, 839752) When the two parties to a settlement know their strength, foul play can avail little.
('8', 350, 1, 17, 839838) I believe the strength of the Indian community consists in its truth.
('8', 350, 1, 18, 839908) General Smuts falsehood will prove unavailing in the face of that truth.
('8', 350, 1, 19, 839981) To those who blame me, I have only this to say: If you were sincere in your reproaches, you should join the satyagraha movement again.
('8', 350, 1, 20, 840116) It was because I put my trust [in General Smuts] that I advised voluntary registration.
('8', 350, 1, 21, 840204) We took a pledge to see to it that the law would be repealed; you and I have fought together to fulfil that pledge and let us now continue to do so.
('8', 350, 1, 22, 840353) It will suffice if you do this.
('8', 350, 1, 23, 840385) You deserve to be congratulated in that your suspicions have been justified.
('8', 350, 1, 24, 840462) If, in the sequel, my trust turns out to have been ill placed, I do not hold myself responsible, for I had no alternative then.
('8', 350, 1, 25, 840590) Even if you think otherwise, the Indian community has lost nothing for having trusted [General Smuts].
('8', 350, 1, 26, 840693) For we shall gain more now if we stand together. To those who were pleased with me on account of the settlement, and who approved of it, I should say: If General Smuts is bent on playing foul, it does not follow that the settlement itself deserves to be condemned.
('8', 350, 1, 27, 840958) It has been nothing if not beneficial.
('8', 350, 1, 28, 840997) If our strength is real, we will not retreat an inch.
('8', 350, 1, 29, 841051) On the contrary, the more the other side attempts foul play, the better to advantage will our truth be set off.
('8', 350, 1, 30, 841163) Diamonds shine the brighter for being strewn among stones.
('8', 350, 1, 31, 841222) Learn to think of truth in this way. Whether or not those who have been angry with me or those who approved of my action join the

('8', 351, 5, 10, 841952) With reference to your last note, I wish to state that I never asked for or desired any protection for myself from the Government, nor do I desire any now.

('8', 351, 10, 14, 842228) HAWKERS, LOOK OUT !
('8', 351, 11, 15, 842248) There is a journal called De Transvaaler published in English and Dutch from Johannesburg.
('8', 351, 11, 16, 842339) It has attacked Indians hawking vegetables.
('8', 351, 11, 17, 842383) I give below an extract from the journals comments: White women continue to patronize Indian hawkers selling vegetables.
('8', 351, 11, 18, 842504) This is detrimental to white interests.
('8', 351, 11, 19, 842544) Seven Indians were fined in February for storing their vegetables in bedrooms.
('8', 351, 11, 20, 842623) The municipality did not confiscate the stocks, though it had the right to.
('8', 351, 11, 21, 842699) In Jubilee Street, there are three latrines in front of Nathansons house, one of which is used as a urinal, another as a lavatory and the third for stocking vegetables.
('8', 351, 11, 22, 842868) Will any woman

('8', 352, 1, 2, 842999) who knows of this and values cleanliness buy these vegetables?
('8', 352, 1, 3, 843062) Moreover, there are two municipal stables which the coolies use for sleeping in and for storing their vegetables.
('8', 352, 1, 4, 843176) Inspectors should go round at night to detect the offenders.
('8', 352, 1, 5, 843237) This is what the journal says.
('8', 352, 1, 6, 843268) True, much of it is exaggeration.
('8', 352, 1, 7, 843302) But it is undoubtedly true that some hawkers live in unclean surroundings, are dirty of person and store the vegetables in dirty places.
('8', 352, 1, 8, 843439) If they do not improve, it may be taken for granted that in course of time no Indian hawkers will be left in this country.
('8', 352, 1, 9, 843562) These reports of our uncleanliness come at a time when proposals are being mooted for legislation on hawkers licences.
('8', 352, 1, 10, 843681) I have earlier suggested that, if they stop issuing licences to hawkers, the latter can successfully resort to satyagraha.
('8', 352, 1, 11, 843804) But in satyagraha, it must be remembered, truth must not be forsaken.
('8', 352, 1, 12, 843874) I think it unfair that the hawkers do not adhere to [proper standards of] cleanliness or that they store vegetables in unclean places; and what is unfair is contrary to truth.
('8', 352, 1, 13, 844050) Monday [June 1, 1908]
('8', 352, 2, 14, 844072) SATYAGRAHA CAMPAIGN
('8', 352, 3, 15, 844092) This campaign cannot yet be said to have really started.
('8', 352, 3, 16, 844149) But it may be claimed the foundations have been laid.
('8', 352, 3, 17, 844203) In reply to Mr. Gandhis notice 1, Mr. Chamney wrote that a reply to the request for the return of the applications would be sent after General Smuts return from the Cape.
('8', 352, 3, 18, 844374) Mr. Gandhi sent a telegram 2 saying that this was not a matter that couldwait, and that the documents should be returned without delay.
('8', 352, 3, 19, 844510) The telegram was despatched on Friday.
('8', 352, 3, 20, 844549) On Saturday, a telegram was received [in reply] stating that the draft Bill 3 submitted by Mr. Gandhi having been misplaced, another copy should be forwarded.
('8', 352, 3, 21, 844708) Copies were then sent of Mr. Gandhis letter 4 of February 22 and the draft of the proposed Bill.
('8', 352, 3, 22, 844805) On Monday, a telephone mes sage was received to the effect that General Smuts had called a meet ing of the Cabinet and that a reply would be sent on Tuesday.
('8', 352, 3, 23, 844963) This is where matters stand as I write this news letter on Monday evening.
('8', 352, 4, 24, 845038) CARTWRIGHTS EFFORTS
('8', 352, 5, 25, 845058) All this while, Mr. Cartwright has been exerting himself a

('8', 353, 1, 3, 845321) He arranged [for Mr. Gandhi] to meet Sir Percy Fitzpatrick, Mr. Chaplin and Mr. Lindsay.
('8', 353, 1, 4, 845410) All these persons admit that the outrageous Act ought not to apply to those who have taken out registers volun tarily or may do so in future.
('8', 353, 1, 5, 845552) The last word in the matter clearly rests with the Indian community.
('8', 353, 1, 6, 845621) Since the negotiations are now going on in private, no other steps are called for, which is why a mass meeting has not been held.
('8', 353, 1, 7, 845751) If a fight becomes inevitable, it will be necessary to hold one.
('8', 353, 1, 8, 845816) It was decided not to publicize the letters sent to the Govern ment, but Pretoria News has already reproduced them from Indian Opinion.
('8', 353, 1, 9, 845952) Notices demanding the return of applications continue to be served on Mr. Chamney.
('8', 353, 1, 10, 846035) Hopes of a settlement have, however, induced some slackness in this regard.
('8', 353, 1, 11, 846111) Circular letters [from the British Indian Association] have been sent round to [committees in] all the towns.
('8', 353, 1, 12, 846221) Everyone will send the notice.
('8', 353, 1, 13, 846252) 1 Tuesday [June 2, 1908] Mr. Hosken, Mr. Doke, Mr. Phillips, Mr. Polak, Mr. Perry and others met at Mr. Hoskens office.
('8', 353, 1, 14, 846372) At this meeting, they reaffirmed their decision to lend assistance to the Indian community.
('8', 353, 1, 15, 846464) There has been no news so far from Pretoria.
('8', 353, 2, 16, 846509) CEMETERY
('8', 353, 3, 17, 846518) For some time the local Town Council has had an eye on the Muslim section of the cemetery.
('8', 353, 3, 18, 846609) It is obviously much too large.
('8', 353, 3, 19, 846641) But it is the view of the Moulvis that, since the place has been used as a Muslim cemetery, non Muslims may not be buried there.
('8', 353, 3, 20, 846770) The Hami dia Islamic Societyhas accordingly written to say that non Muslims must not be buried there.
('8', 353, 3, 21, 846872) On Friday, a deputation in this connection waited on the Chairman of the Park Committee near the cemetery.
('8', 353, 3, 22, 846979) It consisted of Moulvi Ahmed Mukhtiar, Imam Kamali, Imam Abdool Kadir, Mr. Abdul Gani 2, Mr. Shahabuddin and Mr. Gandhi.
('8', 353, 3, 23, 847100) The deputation met the Park Committee on Monday at half past three.
('8', 353, 3, 24, 847168) This time, it included Mr. Abdul Gani, Imam Kamali, Imam Abdool Kadir and Mr. Gandhi.
('8', 353, 3, 25, 847254) They placed the whole position before the [entire] Committee and requested it to consider the matter.

('8', 354, 1, 2, 847519) GOOD USE OF GIFTS
('8', 354, 2, 3, 847537) Mr. Polak had received a gift of 50 from the British Indian Association in connection with the last campaign.
('8', 354, 2, 4, 847647) Instead of spending the money on themselves, Mr. Polak and Mr. Isaac [who received a similar gift] decided to use it for the [benefit of the] Indian community.
('8', 354, 2, 5, 847807) Accordingly, Mr. Polak has sent the amount as a gift to Joseph 1 who is passing through a difficult time in England and has had to stop his work due to lack of funds.
('8', 354, 2, 6, 847974) Mr. Isaac decided to spend the sum received by him to further the cause of Indian education, and has done so.
('8', 354, 2, 7, 848084) I have already referred to the gifts received by Mr. Doke and Mr. David Pollock.
('8', 354, 2, 8, 848165) 2 They have decided to use them in the cause of Asiatic education.
('8', 354, 2, 9, 848232) This way of using ones gifts clearly deserves to be admired and emulated.
('8', 354, 2, 10, 848306) Wednesday [June 3, 1908] News has been received today that, most probably, General Smuts will repeal the Act.
('8', 354, 2, 11, 848416) There has so far been no intimation from the Government.
('8', 354, 2, 12, 848473) But all the white leaders are still discussing the question.

('8', 355, 6, 8, 849994) [JOHANNESBURG,] June 6, 1908]
('8', 355, 7, 9, 850024) [DEAR MR. SMUTS, ] I hope you will pardon me for writing you about the interview 2 that took place today between you and me.
('8', 355, 7, 10, 850149) While I appreciate your desire to abide by the compromise, I cannot help saying that the interview was not satisfactory.
('8', 355, 7, 11, 850270) You still hesitate about repeal of the Act, and you are emphatic that, if the Act is not repealed, it is under it that Asiatics who arrived after the 9th ultimo and who had a right to enter the country should be registered.
('8', 355, 7, 12, 850494) The repeal of the Act, as I havealways said, was the goal of the Asiatics, and they have done much and surrendered much, in order to reach the goal.
('8', 355, 7, 13, 850643) I have gathered also that you admit the Asiatic Act to be wholly bad, and that amendment of the Immigrants Restriction Act is not an undesirable way of solving the problem.
('8', 355, 7, 14, 850816) I once more remind you of what you told me at the interviews on the subject: that, if the Asiatics carried out their part of the compromise, you would repeal the Act.
('8', 355, 7, 15, 850983) I know you added also that if there was one recalcitrant Asiatic who obstinately refused to take out a voluntary registration certificate you would enforce the Act against that Asiatic.
('8', 355, 7, 16, 851169) As a matter of fact, within my knowledge, there is no such recalcitrant Asiatic left.
('8', 355, 7, 17, 851255) But, if there were, I have taken the above expression to be purely theatrical to emphasize the fact that the vast majority of the Asiatics then resident in the Colony should abide by the compromise.
('8', 355, 7, 18, 851454) This they have done.
('8', 355, 7, 19, 851475) Time is of the essence of the contract at the present moment,
('8', 355, 8, 20, 851537) 1 A copy of this letter was sent by Ritch as an annexure to his letter of July 27, 1908 to the Colonial Office.
('8', 355, 8, 21, 851649) 2 In a letter written on behalf of General Smuts on June 4, 1908, Lane had asked Gandhiji for an interview to discuss the draft Asiatic Bill for the retrospective validation of voluntary registration; vide S. N. 4822.
('8', 356, 0, 1, 851867) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 357
('8', 356, 1, 2, 851912) and I do hope that you will let me make a definite statement that the Act is to be repealed.
('8', 356, 1, 3, 852005) Otherwise, I shall be reluctantly compelled to fall back upon my letter 1 to Mr. Chamney as to withdrawal of the application form.
('8', 356, 1, 4, 852136) I am most anxious to avoid a situation of that character, but it is impossible to wait for the assurance till the first week of the opening of Parliament.
('8', 356, 1, 5, 852291) If, therefore, you cannot give the assurance, and if you cannot return the application forms to those 2 who have written for their return, an application must be made to the Supreme Court for an order compelling the return of the documents.
('8', 356, 2, 6, 852532) In an amendment of the Immigrants Restriction Act, I venture to suggest that it will not at all satisfy the Asiatics if the question of people to remain in or enter the country is left to the discretion of an Administrative Officer.
('8', 356, 2, 7, 852765) That, as in every other Colony, should be decided judicially.
('8', 356, 2, 8, 852827) The right of those who have paid a 3 fee to the old Dutch Government, I need hardly say, should be respected.
('8', 356, 2, 9, 852937) There are many such already in the Transvaal with vested interests.
('8', 356, 2, 10, 853005) They have also applied.
('8', 356, 2, 11, 853029) These were contemplated, I am sure, by Mr. Patrick Duncan, when he first introduced his Bill, and their claim, in my opinion, ought not to be disregarded.
('8', 356, 2, 12, 853184) Mr. Lane wrote to me on Friday 4, saying that the letters of the 1st and 22nd February last addressed by me to you, being confi dential, should not be published.
('8', 356, 2, 13, 853346) As they constitute proof positive of my contention that you promised to repeal the Act, should you withdraw from that position, and should you controvert the statement made by me, I hope you will not bind me to one sided confidence.

('8', 357, 2, 3, 854062) [JOHANNESBURG,] June 6, 1908
('8', 357, 3, 4, 854091) DEAR MR. CARTWRIGHT, Following the precedent you have allowed me to adopt, I send on to you copy of my letter 1 to General Smuts.
('8', 357, 3, 5, 854221) The interview was both satisfactory and unsatisfactoryunsatisfactory because the situation required consideration de novo and therefore, I had to return without a definite assurance of repeal.
('8', 357, 3, 6, 854414) But what I have gathered is that if the Progressive Party does not place any obstacles in the way, the Act will be repealed, and what I also gathered was that, if we remain true to our principles to resist, there is absolutely no escape from it.
('8', 357, 3, 7, 854660) He realizes that he cannot have two laws on the Statute book for the same purpose.
('8', 357, 3, 8, 854743) He has departed absolutely from the position that voluntary registrants should have their status defined under the Asiatic Act, so that if we did not remain firm and the Progressive Party put obstacles in this 2 way, we might have the ludicrous position of 6,000 to 7,000 Asiatics practically lawless, shall I say?
('8', 357, 3, 9, 855058) I shall take an early opportunity of seeing you.
('8', 357, 3, 10, 855107) Meantime, may I rely upon you to continue the role of Angel of Peace, and to suffi ciently change the Progressive mind in favour of Justice and Right eousness?
('8', 357, 4, 11, 855267) Yours sincerely,

('8', 357, 7, 14, 855373) A correspondent draws our attention to the frequency of the recent murders in Natal.
('8', 357, 7, 15, 855458) There have been, he says, seven murders within two weeks: one in Tongaat, two in Cato Manor, one in Spring field, one in Northdene and two in Durban.
('8', 357, 7, 16, 855608) The correspondent adds that only in one of the seven cases have the police been able to appre hend the murderer.
('8', 357, 7, 17, 855721) And that because the culprit gave himself up.
('8', 357, 7, 18, 855767) The correspondent also reports an increase in the number of thefts.
('8', 357, 7, 19, 855835) This matter deserves attention.
('8', 357, 7, 20, 855867) A people that aspires to the

('8', 358, 0, 1, 855937) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 359
('8', 358, 1, 2, 855982) privileges of freedom must have the strength to defend itself.
('8', 358, 1, 3, 856045) There are two ways of doing this.
('8', 358, 1, 4, 856079) The firsta simple and straightforward though difficult wayis to reform ourselves, to avoid the creation of circumstances that occasion murder, not to hoard wealth, and to reform those with criminal propensities.
('8', 358, 1, 5, 856291) Till the criminal improves, he must be allowed to commit as many murders as he likes.
('8', 358, 1, 6, 856377) He will give up when he wearies of killing.
('8', 358, 1, 7, 856421) Clearly, this is at once a divine and a natural law.
('8', 358, 1, 8, 856474) As a people, however, we are not yet free to follow this course of not punishing a murderer.
('8', 358, 1, 9, 856567) We shall not assert that a time will never come when all of us acquire enough courage to become indifferent to life and property, but only that it is improbable that this state of affairs will ever come about.
('8', 358, 1, 10, 856777) History records no instance of this ever having happened among any people.
('8', 358, 1, 11, 856852) However, instances are known of individuals who have acted in that manner.
('8', 358, 1, 12, 856927) If we cannot adopt this course, there is another which we, as a people aspiring to be free, ought to know aboutthat of countering force with force.
('8', 358, 1, 13, 857075) We should become strong enough to defend life and property.
('8', 358, 1, 14, 857135) Of course, protection is provided by the Natal Government.
('8', 358, 1, 15, 857194) But whites do not look on helplessly [when attacked by anyone].
('8', 358, 1, 16, 857258) They equip themselves with the means of self defence.
('8', 358, 1, 17, 857312) If anyone counters by saying that we are not allowed to keep arms or that we cannot have them when we need them, those excuses will not be valid.
('8', 358, 1, 18, 857458) We can defend ourselves without weapons.
('8', 358, 1, 19, 857499) It is a matter of training ones body and of skill.
('8', 358, 1, 20, 857550) When we were attacked by the whites in Ame rica, we hid ourselves.
('8', 358, 1, 21, 857617) When they attacked the Japanese, the latter armed themselves with sticks and bottles.
('8', 358, 1, 22, 857703) 1 Many whites are able to defend themselves without so much as a revolver.
('8', 358, 1, 23, 857778) Indians must learn to do likewise.
('8', 358, 1, 24, 857813) This of course cannot happen in a day.
('8', 358, 1, 25, 857852) While a fire is raging, what is the use of advising one ever so wisely that one should start digging a well? This would be a well deserved taunt.
('8', 358, 1, 26, 857998) But we wish to suggest a measure that can be adopted immediately and will fore stall this taunt.
('8', 358, 1, 27, 858095) Primarily our duty is to search out the hidden causes and suggest permanent remedies.
('8', 358, 1, 28, 858181) It is quackery to apply ointment on a boil; the infection should be traced to its source and effectively treated.
('8', 358, 1, 29, 858295) The immediate thing for the Indian community to do is to petition the Government asking for stricter police protection in loca lities where murders are frequent.
('8', 358, 1, 30, 858457) There is little possibility of the Government being able to provide such protection in outlying areas.
('8', 358, 1, 31, 858560) The residents of these localities or regions should act collectively and
('8', 358, 2, 32, 858633) 1 The incident referred to took place in Canada; vide Indians in Canada, 25 4 1908
('8', 359, 0, 1, 858716) 360 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 359, 1, 2, 858758) employ their own watchmen.
('8', 359, 1, 3, 858785) Alternatively, the people in sparsely populated areas should shift to more thickly populated ones.
('8', 359, 1, 4, 858884) Acting collectively in these matters is an essential characteristic of nation hood.
('8', 359, 1, 5, 858968) We are about to become a nation.
('8', 359, 1, 6, 859001) But Indians must bear in mind that they are not yet a nation in the modern sense of the term.
('8', 359, 1, 7, 859095) We cannot become something by imagining we are that.

('8', 359, 2, 9, 859189) 199. SARVODAYA [ IV]
('8', 359, 3, 10, 859210) ROOTS OF TRUTH
('8', 359, 4, 11, 859225) If this can happen in the professions mentioned, why not in trade and commerce?
('8', 359, 4, 12, 859305) Why is it that trade is always associated with unscrupulousness?
('8', 359, 4, 13, 859370) We shall see on reflection that it is always assumed that the merchant is moved [solely] by self interest.
('8', 359, 4, 14, 859477) Even though he has a socially useful function, we take it for granted that his object is to fill his own coffers.
('8', 359, 4, 15, 859591) Even the laws are so drafted as to enable the merchant to amass wealth with the utmost speed.
('8', 359, 4, 16, 859685) It is also accepted as a principle that the buyer must offer the lowest possible price and the seller must demand and accept the highest.
('8', 359, 4, 17, 859823) The trader has thus been encouraged in this habit, yet the public themselves look down on him for his dishonesty.
('8', 359, 4, 18, 859937) This principle must be abandoned.
('8', 359, 4, 19, 859971) It is not right that the merchant should look only to self interest and amass wealth.
('8', 359, 4, 20, 860057) This is not trade, but robbery.
('8', 359, 4, 21, 860089) The soldier lays down his life for the state and the trader ought to suffer [a comparable] loss, ought even to lose his life in the interests of society.
('8', 359, 4, 22, 860243) In all states the soldiers profession is to defend the people; the pastors to teach it; the phy sicians to keep it in health; the lawyers to enforce pure justice in it; and the merchants to provide for it.
('8', 359, 4, 23, 860449) And it is the duty of each on due occasion to die for the people.
('8', 359, 4, 24, 860515) The soldier must be prepared to die at his post of duty rather than desert it.
('8', 359, 4, 25, 860594) During a plague epidemic, the physician must not run away [from his task] but instead attend to the patients even at the risk of infection.
('8', 359, 4, 26, 860734) The priest must lead people from error to truth even if they should kill him for it.
('8', 359, 4, 27, 860819) The lawyer must ensure, even at the cost of his life, that justice prevails.
('8', 359, 5, 28, 860896) 1 Ruskin found Beauty in the appearance of felicitous fulfilment of function in living things, more especially of the joyful and right exertion of perfect life in man.
('8', 359, 5, 29, 861064) (Modern Painters, Vol. II, Part III, Sec.
('8', 359, 5, 30, 861106) I, Ch. 3.) Gandhiji, too, speaks of the beauty
('8', 359, 6, 31, 861153) )) of satyagraha, which is suffering undergone to exemplify Truth.
('8', 359, 6, 32, 861220) To see Truth is to assent to it, and thus it helps Reason as a means of ordering social relations.
('8', 360, 0, 1, 861319) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 361
('8', 360, 1, 2, 861364) We pointed out above the proper occasions for members of the professions to lay down their lives.
('8', 360, 1, 3, 861462) What, then, is the proper occasion for the merchant to lay down his life?
('8', 360, 1, 4, 861536) This is a question which all, the merchant included, must ask themselves.
('8', 360, 1, 5, 861610) The man who does not know when to die does not know how to live.
('8', 360, 1, 6, 861675) We have seen that the mer chants function is to provide for the people.
('8', 360, 1, 7, 861747) Just as the clergymans function is not to earn a stipend but to instruct, so the merchants function is not to make profits but to provide for the people.
('8', 360, 1, 8, 861901) The clergyman who devotes himself to preaching has his needs provided for, and in the same manner the merchant will have his profits.
('8', 360, 1, 9, 862035) But neither of them must have an eye only on the main chance.
('8', 360, 1, 10, 862097) Both have work to doeach a duty to performirrespective of whether or not they get the stipend or the profit.
('8', 360, 1, 11, 862206) If this proposition is true, the mer chant deserves the highest honour.
('8', 360, 1, 12, 862278) For his duty is to procure com modities of high quality and distribute them at a price which people can afford.
('8', 360, 1, 13, 862390) It also becomes his duty at the same time to ensure the safety and wellbeing of the hundreds or thousands of men working under him.
('8', 360, 1, 14, 862522) This requires a great deal of patience, kindness and intel ligence.
('8', 360, 1, 15, 862590) Also, in discharging these several functions he is bound, as others are bound, to give up his life, if need be.
('8', 360, 1, 16, 862702) Such a trader would not sell adulterated goods or cheat anyone, whatever his difficulties or even if he was going to be reduced to utter poverty.
('8', 360, 1, 17, 862848) Moreover, he will treat the men under him with the utmost kindness.
('8', 360, 1, 18, 862916) Very often a young man taking up a situation with a big factory or commercial house travels a long way from home, so that the master has to accept the role of his parents.
('8', 360, 1, 19, 863088) If the master is indifferent, the young man will be like an orphan.
('8', 360, 1, 20, 863156) At every step, therefore, the merchant or the master must ask himself this question, Do I deal with my servants as I do with my sons? Suppose a ships captain places his son among the common sailors under his command.
('8', 360, 1, 21, 863373) The captains duty is to treat all sailors as he would treat his son.
('8', 360, 1, 22, 863442) In the same manner, a merchant may ask his son to work alongside of those under him.
('8', 360, 1, 23, 863527) He must always treat the workers as he would then treat his son.
('8', 360, 1, 24, 863592) This is the true meaning of economics.
('8', 360, 1, 25, 863631) And as the captain is bound to be the last man to leave his ship in case of shipwreck, so in the event of famine or other calamities, the trader is bound to safeguard the interests of his men before his own.
('8', 360, 1, 26, 863839) All this may sound strange.
('8', 360, 1, 27, 863867) But the really strange thing about the modern age is that it should so sound.
('8', 360, 1, 28, 863945) For anyone who applies his mind to it will be able to see that the true principle is as we have stated
('8', 361, 0, 1, 864048) 362 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 361, 1, 2, 864090) Any other standard is impossible for a progressive nation.
('8', 361, 1, 3, 864149) If the British have survived so long, it is not because they have lived up to the maxims of economics, but because they have had many heroes who have questioned them and followed instead these principles of moral conduct.
('8', 361, 1, 4, 864371) The harm that results from the violation of these principles and the nations consequent decline from greatness, we shall consider on another occasion.

('8', 361, 3, 7, 864611) WAS SETTLEMENT IN WRITING?
('8', 361, 4, 8, 864638) This question has been raised in many quarters.
('8', 361, 4, 9, 864686) I therefore give here again a translation of the letters on the basis of which the settle ment was reached.
('8', 361, 4, 10, 864794) I say again because these were translated or summarized 1 in February.
('8', 361, 4, 11, 864865) The genesis of the letter [to Smuts,] written from gaol, must be remembered.
('8', 361, 4, 12, 864942) Mr. Cartwright met us in gaol on be half of the Government and presented a letter to Mr. Gandhi for sign ature.
('8', 361, 4, 13, 865054) Some alterations were made in the draft, and the amended letter was taken to General Smuts.
('8', 361, 4, 14, 865146) The following is a translation of the letter 2.
('8', 361, 5, 15, 865194) WHAT WERE THE CHANGES?
('8', 361, 6, 16, 865217) This is the letter that was sent.
('8', 361, 6, 17, 865251) The original draft Act had the following features: 1. it did not refer to the Chinese; 2. even children under sixteen were to take out registers voluntarily; 3. it was provided that the voluntary registrants should not be subject to the penalties of the Act; 4. no provision was made for Indians who might return to the Colony after the date of the settlement; 5. the Registration Office was to be re opened; 6. no reference was made to religious susceptibilities.
('8', 361, 6, 18, 865716) In the letter mentioned above,
('8', 361, 7, 19, 865747) 1 They were translated and paraphrased in the process.

('8', 362, 1, 2, 865979) 1. the Chinese were included; 2. it was provided that children under sixteen should not have to take out the new registers even on a voluntary basis; 3. it was provided that the Act would not apply to voluntary registrants; (The reader should note that there is a great deal of difference between the Act would not apply [to those who register voluntarily] and [they] would not be subject to the penalties of the Act.) 4. those who came after the date of the settlement were also given the right to apply for voluntary registration; 5. the reopening of the Registration Office 1 was capable of two interpretations.
('8', 362, 1, 3, 866594) We therefore wrote [in order] to accept registration; 6. reference was made to religious susceptibilities to point out that they must be respected.
('8', 362, 1, 4, 866742) If now we remember that, since the number of those who have applied for voluntary registration is very large, the Act ceases to have any meaning, it will be noted that the repeal of the Act was implied [in our letter].
('8', 362, 2, 5, 866961) REPLY FROM GENERAL SMUTS
('8', 362, 3, 6, 866986) General Smuts sent the following reply to this: 2
('8', 362, 4, 7, 867036) WHAT THIS MEANS
('8', 362, 5, 8, 867052) In this letter General Smuts accepted unconditionally [the terms contained in] the prisoners letter.
('8', 362, 5, 9, 867153) It therefore implied acceptance of the condition that the voluntary registrants would not come within the scope of the law, from which it is clear that, if all the Indians or a majority of them took out these registers, the law would have to be repealed.
('8', 362, 5, 10, 867408) Moreover, after his meeting with General Smuts on February 1, Mr. Gandhi wrote to him.
('8', 362, 5, 11, 867495) He was then invited to [go to] Pretoria on the 3rd.
('8', 362, 5, 12, 867547) On this occasion, too, the repeal of the Act was discussed and later, on the 22nd, Mr. Gandhi sent a draft Bill 3 in this connection to General Smuts.
('8', 362, 5, 13, 867698) All this is probably known to the reader.
('8', 362, 5, 14, 867740) There is no doubt therefore that there exists a written commitment about the

('8', 363, 1, 3, 868275) General Smuts wanted to goback on it, but we can see now that he will not be able to do so.
('8', 363, 1, 4, 868367) Of course, we cannot take it for granted that he will not do so.
('8', 363, 1, 5, 868432) What he does will depend entirely on our courage.
('8', 363, 2, 6, 868482) INTERVIEW WITH GENERAL SMUTS
('8', 363, 3, 7, 868511) As a result of the notices sent by Indians withdrawing their applications and the good offices of friends like Mr. Cartwright, a letter was received from General Smuts last Friday [inviting Mr. Gandhi] for a discussion on the proposed Bill.
('8', 363, 3, 8, 868752) A meeting of the Committee [of the British Indian Association] was immediately held.
('8', 363, 3, 9, 868837) Mr. Essop Mia also attended.
('8', 363, 3, 10, 868866) It was resolved at the meeting to send a reply to General Smuts to say that Mr. Gandhi would see him in order to acquaint himself with the nature of the Bill and he would then report to the Committee on the interview.
('8', 363, 3, 11, 869084) Mr. Gandhi was instructed not to commit himself in any way to General Smuts.
('8', 363, 3, 12, 869161) He was only to reiterate the demand for the repeal of the outrageous Act.
('8', 363, 3, 13, 869235) The interview with General Smuts took place on Saturday.
('8', 363, 3, 14, 869292) Mr. Mathews, who had drafted the Bill, Mr. Gorges 1 and Mr. Chamney were present at the meeting.
('8', 363, 3, 15, 869389) In the course of the talk they discussed the question of amending the immigration Act and repealing the [Asiatic Registration] Act.
('8', 363, 3, 16, 869521) General Smuts admitted that the Asiatic Act served no useful purpose.
('8', 363, 3, 17, 869591) Mr. Lanes letter to Mr. Cartwright was the result of a mistake.
('8', 363, 3, 18, 869655) He added that, whatever the nature of the Bill that was ultimately passed, the voluntary registrants would certainly not be subject to the Asiatic Registration Act.
('8', 363, 3, 19, 869820) No clarification was, however, offered about the status of those who had not taken out registers [voluntarily], neither was any assurance given about the repeal of the Act; it was merely stated that the Bill was yet to be drafted.
('8', 363, 3, 20, 870051) That is to say, General Smuts means to keep at least one of his three promises, and voluntary registrants will not therefore come within the scope of the law.
('8', 363, 3, 21, 870210) [But] fulfilling this promise implies the fulfilment of the two others as well.
('8', 363, 3, 22, 870290) For it cannot happen that one half of the Indian community is governed by one law and the other half by another.
('8', 363, 3, 23, 870403) That is, the law will be repealed.
('8', 363, 3, 24, 870438) It has to be.
('8', 363, 3, 25, 870452) The new Bill must also make provision for those who may enter the Colony hereafter.

('8', 364, 4, 8, 871139) DEAR MR. PAUL, Mr. Louis Joseph 1 writes to me that you are now interesting yourself in Joseph Royeppen.
('8', 364, 4, 9, 871244) If you can make a collection, it will be rather good, because Joseph will certainly want some more money.
('8', 364, 4, 10, 871350) Collection here is still going on.
('8', 364, 4, 11, 871385) What is more, if the collection is made, it can be handed to Mr. Polak, because Mr. Polak has not irrevocably given the 50. 2 He expects Joseph to return it, so that the money can be used again for a useful purpose.
('8', 364, 4, 12, 871601) Ward Angie 3 has evidently forgotten her guardian entirely.
('8', 364, 4, 13, 871661) She perhaps thinks she is no longer fit to be a ward, but tell her not to forget that it was not long ago when she had to be carried on the joint arms of Mr. Isaac and myself a good distance.

('8', 365, 1, 2, 872230) 202. NATAL LICENSING ACT
('8', 365, 2, 3, 872255) We hope that the successful outcome of Mr. Kazis 1 appeal will not lead any Indian to expect that the trouble about licences is over.
('8', 365, 2, 4, 872389) All that this case shows is that only those persons whose interests are affected have a right to be heard in an appeal.
('8', 365, 2, 5, 872509) This appeal should be treated as similar to the case of Somnath Maharaj.
('8', 365, 2, 6, 872582) As long as the licensing Act continues to be in force and the final authority rests with the [Licensing] Officer, the Indian trader will continue to run a serious risk.
('8', 365, 2, 7, 872751) What is worse, the threatened legislation is like a red hot brand held against an already blistered skin.
('8', 365, 2, 8, 872857) At a time when the community is faced with these problems, we find some persons engaged in a dispute about the rights of the Main Line Indians.
('8', 365, 2, 9, 873001) We do not see any conflict between the interests of the Main Line Indians and those of the others, so the question as to who the trustee is does not arise.
('8', 365, 2, 10, 873157) If the affairs of the Congress are conducted honestly, there is nothing more to be said.
('8', 365, 2, 11, 873246) Many persons from among the Main Line Indians hold the office of Vice President.
('8', 365, 2, 12, 873327) If it is possible for them to visit Durban occasionally, they can also get themselves included in the Managing Committee.
('8', 365, 2, 13, 873449) This is not impossible.
('8', 365, 2, 14, 873473) But the work of the Committee should not later have to be held up because these persons do not attend [meetings].
('8', 365, 2, 15, 873587) The best course for the Main Line Indians would be to nominate some representatives in Durban, in whom they have confidence, and ask them to attend every meeting.
('8', 365, 2, 16, 873750) But compared to the danger that threatens, this is an insigni ficant dispute.
('8', 365, 2, 17, 873828) What is needed is for all of us to join hands in oppo sing the Government.
('8', 365, 2, 18, 873903) A great flood is approaching; and it must be stemmed.
('8', 365, 2, 19, 873957) All available hands are needed.
('8', 365, 2, 20, 873989) How can this [task] be achi 
('8', 365, 3, 21, 874018) 1 On Kazis behalf, one Hillier filed an appeal in the Natal Supreme Court against a decision of the Licensing Board of the Mapumulo Division, which had refused to confirm a renewal of licence granted him by the Licensing Officer.
('8', 365, 3, 22, 874248) The ground of appeal was that, since Mr. Carter, a member of the Board who was also a store keeper in the same Division, was an interested party, he was not a fit and proper person to deal with the case.
('8', 365, 3, 23, 874452) In his judgment the Chief justice ruled that Mr. Carter had no such interest that disqualified him from sitting on the Board.
('8', 365, 3, 24, 874578) As for Mr. Whittaker, who was only an employee in a store and who had appealed before the Board against the renewal of Kazis licence at the Board hearing, the Chief Justice observed that his interest was not sufficient to justify his opposing the grant of a licence.
('8', 365, 3, 25, 874845) No person, he said, was entitled to appeal unless he had a direct, personal and substantial interest.
('8', 365, 3, 26, 874947) The Court quashed the proceedings of the Licensing Board.

('8', 366, 3, 6, 875325) Dark clouds lour upon the Rhodesia Indians.
('8', 366, 3, 7, 875369) New laws are about to be passed.
('8', 366, 3, 8, 875402) For one thing, [there will follow] harassment of the Indian businessman and, for another, a Registration Act similar to the one in the Transvaal [is about to be enacted].
('8', 366, 3, 9, 875573) The intention thus seems to be to close in on the Indians from all sides.
('8', 366, 3, 10, 875647) In Rhodesia also, it is essential that Indians should resort to satyagraha.
('8', 366, 3, 11, 875723) Whether they can do this will depend upon their relations with the whites in that Colony, the number of Indians settled there, 1 what sort of people they are and other relevant factors.
('8', 366, 3, 12, 875909) It is also necessary that the Rhodesia Indians write to the South Africa British Indian Committee and contribute towards its funds.
('8', 366, 3, 13, 876041) All of us have seen the invaluable work it has been doing.
('8', 366, 3, 14, 876100) We have seen a copy of the proposed Bill, which is modelled on the Transvaal measure.
('8', 366, 3, 15, 876186) It is worse than the Transvaal Act, since it applies to women also.
('8', 366, 3, 16, 876254) It lays down, moreover, that Indians will only have a period of six months after its promulgation in which to register themselves.
('8', 366, 3, 17, 876385) We hear that Rhodesia Indians have decided to oppose this Bill.
('8', 366, 3, 18, 876449) Even copies of a petition are ready.
('8', 366, 3, 19, 876486) If they bring sufficient pressure to bear [on the authorities], the Bill will never be passed.
('8', 366, 3, 20, 876581) It is their duty to act firmly.
('8', 366, 3, 21, 876613) This instance shows that we did well to fight in the Transvaal and that Indians should persevere in their campaign.
('8', 366, 3, 22, 876729) The world over, the Asiatic and the European are engaged in a conflict.
('8', 366, 3, 23, 876801) In this struggle, victory will go to the party that has right on its side.
('8', 366, 3, 24, 876876) At the moment, truth appears to be on the side of the Asiatic.

('8', 367, 2, 3, 877130) VEINS OF WEALTH
('8', 367, 3, 4, 877146) Economists may reply in the following manner to what we said earlier concerning roots of truth: It is true that certain advantages flow from social affection.
('8', 367, 3, 5, 877305) But economists do not take these advantages into their reckoning.
('8', 367, 3, 6, 877371) The science with which they are concerned is the science of getting rich.
('8', 367, 3, 7, 877445) Far from being fallacious, it has in experience been found to be effective.
('8', 367, 3, 8, 877521) Those who follow it do become rich, and those who disregard it become poor.
('8', 367, 3, 9, 877597) All the millionaires of Europe have acquired their wealth by following the laws of this science.
('8', 367, 3, 10, 877694) It is futile to seek to controvert this.
('8', 367, 3, 11, 877735) Every man of the world knows how money is made and how it is lost. This is not quite true.
('8', 367, 3, 12, 877826) Men of business do indeed make money but they do not know whether they make it by fair means and if their money making contributes to the national weal.
('8', 367, 3, 13, 877979) Very often they do not even know the meaning of the word rich.
('8', 367, 3, 14, 878042) They do not realize that, if there are rich men, there must also be poor men.
('8', 367, 3, 15, 878120) People sometimes believe, mistakenly, that by following certain precepts it is possible for everybody to become rich.
('8', 367, 3, 16, 878238) But the true position can be compared to a water wheel where one [bucket] empties out as another fills.
('8', 367, 3, 17, 878342) The power of the rupee you possess depends on another going without it.
('8', 367, 3, 18, 878414) If no one wants it, it will be useless to you.
('8', 367, 3, 19, 878461) The power it possesses depends on your neighbours lack of it.
('8', 367, 3, 20, 878523) There can be wealth only where there is scarcity.
('8', 367, 3, 21, 878573) This means that, in order to be rich, one must keep another poor.
('8', 367, 3, 22, 878639) Political economy consists in the production, preservation and distribution, at the fittest time and place, of useful and pleasurable things.
('8', 367, 3, 23, 878781) The farmer who reaps his harvest at the right time, the builder who lays bricks properly, the carpenter who attends to woodwork with care, the woman who runs her kitchen efficiently are all true political economists.
('8', 367, 3, 24, 878998) All of them add to the national income.
('8', 367, 3, 25, 879038) A science that teaches the opposite of this is not political.
('8', 367, 3, 26, 879100) Its only concern is with individuals merely accumulating a certain metal and putting it to profitable use by keeping others in want of it.
('8', 367, 3, 27, 879239) Those who do this estimate their wealththe value of their farms and cattleby the number of rupees they can get for them, rather than the value of their rupees by the number of cattle and farms they can buy with them.
('8', 367, 3, 28, 879456) Furthermore, men who thus accumulate metalrupeesthink [in terms] of the number of workmen whose services they can command.
('8', 367, 3, 29, 879579) Let us suppose that a certain individual possesses gold, silver, corn, etc.
('8', 368, 0, 1, 879655) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 369
('8', 368, 1, 2, 879700) This person will require a servant.
('8', 368, 1, 3, 879736) And if none of his neighbours is in need of gold, silver or corn, he will find it difficult to get one.
('8', 368, 1, 4, 879840) He will then have to bake his bread, make his clothes and plough his field all by himself.
('8', 368, 1, 5, 879931) This man will find his gold to be of no greater value than the yellow pebbles on his estate.
('8', 368, 1, 6, 880024) His hoard of corn will rot.
('8', 368, 1, 7, 880052) For he cannot consume more than his neighbour.
('8', 368, 1, 8, 880099) He must therefore maintain himself by hard labour as other men do.
('8', 368, 1, 9, 880166) Most people will not want to accumulate gold or silver on these terms.
('8', 368, 1, 10, 880237) Careful reflection will show that what we really desire through acquisition of wealth is power over other men[power] to acquire for our advantage the labour of a servant, a tradesman or an artisan.
('8', 368, 1, 11, 880435) And the power we can thus acquire will be in direct proportion to the poverty of others.
('8', 368, 1, 12, 880524) If there is only one person [in a position] to employ a carpenter, the latter will accept whatever wage is offered.
('8', 368, 1, 13, 880640) If there are three or four persons who need his services, he will work for the person who offers him the highest wage.
('8', 368, 1, 14, 880759) So that growing rich means contriving that as large a number of men as possible shall have less than we have.
('8', 368, 1, 15, 880869) Economists generally assume that it is of advantage to the nation as a whole if the mass of people are thus kept in want.
('8', 368, 1, 16, 880991) Equality among men is certainly not possible.
('8', 368, 1, 17, 881037) But conditions of scarcity, unjustly created, injure the nation.
('8', 368, 1, 18, 881102) Scarcity and abundance arising naturally make, and keep, the nation happy.

('8', 368, 3, 21, 881250) JOHANNESBURG, June 13, 1908
('8', 368, 4, 22, 881278) DEAR MR. SMUTS, With reference to the interview I had with you today, I trust you will excuse my trespassing upon your time and attention yet awhile.
('8', 368, 4, 23, 881428) Until the Asiatic question, as far as it arises out of the Asiatic Act, is settled, I am obliged to approach you.
('8', 368, 4, 24, 881542) You doubt my full representative capacity, or, better still, the full representative character of the views submitted by me.
('8', 368, 4, 25, 881667) I admit it only in so far as it affects those who, whilst the passive resistance struggle was going on, accepted the Asiatic Act.
('8', 368, 4, 26, 881797) Even they do not differ from my views, but they, like the national scouts, intend to save their faces.
('8', 368, 5, 27, 881900) 1 This was republished in Indian Opinion, 4 7 1908, and a copy was sent by Ritch as an annexure to his letter of July 27, 1908 to the Colonial Office.
('8', 369, 0, 1, 882051) 370 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 369, 1, 2, 882093) But I hope, with your assistance, to have even them side by side with the other membersof the community.
('8', 369, 1, 3, 882198) I clearly consider that they have erred from fear, but every endeavour is being made to win them over, and, should they notwhy, they represent but a microscopic minority.
('8', 369, 1, 4, 882369) Some of them have had many conversations with me, and they are, undoubtedly, as anxious as the rest of the community that the Asiatic Act should be repealed.
('8', 369, 1, 5, 882527) With reference to the amendment of the Immigration Act, I wish to make the Asiatic position perfectly clear with reference to the following: 1. No position will ever be accepted by the Asiatic communities that does not put those who have not yet entered the country but are entitled to do so on a level with Asiatics who have voluntarily registered.
('8', 369, 1, 6, 882877) They will, therefore, exchange their documents under the amended Act, and take out certificates in the same form as the voluntary form.
('8', 369, 1, 7, 883013) 2. Refugees who have not yet received permits under the Peace Preservation Ordinance should be protected.
('8', 369, 1, 8, 883119) There will be no objection to defining who may be termed a refugeeI suggest residence in the Transvaal for two years prior to the 11th day of October, 1899and a period may be fixed within which these applications may be received, say one year, and they should be entitled to prove their claim before a court of law.
('8', 369, 1, 9, 883435) 3. Those who hold 3 Dutch Registration Certificates should also be protected, the onus being on them to prove that they are bona fide holders thereof.
('8', 369, 1, 10, 883586) 4. Those who hold Peace Preservation Ordinance permits or permits issued by Asiatic Officers should be protected.
('8', 369, 1, 11, 883700) 5. Those who possess educational qualifications, whatever the test may be, should be free like the European immigrants.
('8', 369, 1, 12, 883820) 6. There are applications being made which have not been yet decided by Mr. Chamney, or which he has refused.
('8', 369, 1, 13, 883930) These should be decided finally before a court of law.
('8', 369, 1, 14, 883985) You told me that you did not want to give any rights of domicile beyond those given by the Asiatic Act.
('8', 369, 1, 15, 884089) You will see that in the above, with the exception of holders of 3 Dutch registration certificates, all are provided for under the Asiatic Act, and I have told you that, in my opinion, and according to Mr. Duncans speech, even the holders of 3 Dutch registration certificates are protected under the discretionary clause.
('8', 369, 1, 16, 884411) Only I have suggested that they should be recognized as a matter of right, provided, of course, that they prove their bona fides.
('8', 369, 1, 17, 884541) I need hardly point out that refugees are protected by the
('8', 370, 0, 1, 884600) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 371
('8', 370, 1, 2, 884645) Asiatic Act, because the Peace Preservation Ordinance permits were still to be issued.
('8', 370, 1, 3, 884732) They have only lately been stopped, under your instructions and by virtue of the Immigrants Restriction Act, but I am sure you could never have intended that those who are still outside the Colony and who can beincontestably proved to be old residents should not have their claims considered.
('8', 370, 1, 4, 885025) The definition of a refugee and the time limit provide against possible frauds.
('8', 370, 1, 5, 885105) I ask you to recognize the very great service rendered by the Indian community in giving finger prints in the face of enormous odds, and to recognize also that the resident portion of the community did not avail themselves of the discretionary clause of the compro mise, with reference to education and property qualifications.
('8', 370, 1, 6, 885433) This was done in order to protect those few who were to come in future, and to show what grace, if I may use the term, Asiatic peoples are capable of.
('8', 370, 1, 7, 885584) But I may state that they will never accept, so far as I am aware, anything in the nature of compulsion, when they can be otherwise completely identified.
('8', 370, 1, 8, 885739) The idea is that ignorance or such other thing should be the basis of disqualification, and not race or colour.
('8', 370, 1, 9, 885851) The great principle that the Colonists have laid down, namely, that, in future, Asiatic immigration should be limited only to those who possess educational qualifications of a high order has been admitted.
('8', 370, 1, 10, 886057) But those who are entitled to reside in the country will not accept the bar sinister 1. And, if the question cannot be satisfactorily settled on the above, as I consider it, most reasonable basis, it is better that it is not settled at all.
('8', 370, 1, 11, 886298) I take it that, as you have promised, you will let me see the draft Bill before it is published.
('8', 370, 1, 12, 886395) I have informed the Committee of the Association that you have definitely promised to settle the matter next week.
('8', 370, 1, 13, 886510) The Committee has, therefore, authorized me to postpone the filing of the affidavits 2 in the meanwhile.

('8', 371, 3, 4, 887016) TO THE HONBLE THE SPEAKER AND MEMBERS OF THE HONBLE THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF THE TRANSVAAL PRETORIA
('8', 371, 4, 5, 887119) THE PETITION OF ESSOP ISMAIL MIA IN HIS CAPACITY AS CHAIRMAN OF THE BRITISH INDIAN ASSOCIATION OF THE TRANSVAAL
('8', 371, 5, 6, 887231) HUMBLY SHEWETH THAT 1. Your Petitioner has read with alarm Sections 3, 104, 113, 114, 127, 128 of the Bill2 to amend the Gold Law of the Colony, recently published in the Government Gazette.
('8', 371, 5, 7, 887422) 2. Your Petitioner humbly submits that the above mentioned Sections, if they are approved by this Honble House, will impose upon British Indians resident in the Transvaal disabilities graver than those contemplated by the existing Gold Law, thereby inflicting grave loss to and threatening with ruin a community admitted to be peaceable and law abiding.
('8', 371, 5, 8, 887776) 3. Your Petitioner ventures to draw the attention of this Honble House to the following specific objections 3 on the part of the British Indians resident in this Colony: (a) The Bill retains in the definition of the term Coloured person the word coolie, which, as this Honble House is doubtless aware, when applied to the present British Indian population of the Colony, is an offensive term, there being in the Transvaal very few, if any, coolies in the proper sense of the term.
('8', 371, 5, 9, 888257) Moreover, the bracketing together of African aboriginal Natives and Asiatics, British subjects and non British subjects, is to ignore the peculiar position occupied by British Indian subjects of the Crown.
('8', 371, 5, 10, 888463) (b) In your Petitioners humble opinion, the definition of unwrought gold is calculated to prevent Indian goldsmiths from plying their trade of manufacturing goldware and jewellery even out of gold bars prepared in and imported from
('8', 371, 6, 11, 888695) 1 This appeared in Indian Opinion, 20 6 1908, under the title Transvaal Gold Law: British Indian Protest.

('8', 372, 1, 2, 888957) England, and, it is submitted, this would be a grievous hardship for the goldsmiths in question.
('8', 372, 1, 3, 889054) (c) The retention of the original law as to dealing in unwrought gold, in so far as it specially affects Coloured people, besides their coming under the general prohibitions of the law, assumes that Coloured people are the greater offenders in respect of this crime, whereas, in the humble opinion of the petitioning Association, the contrary is the fact, in so far as British Indians are concerned.
('8', 372, 1, 4, 889454) (d) Your Petitioner ventures to assert that Section 127 of the Bill is vaguely drawn and seems to contemplate entire prohibition of acquisition by British Indians of any rights under it.
('8', 372, 1, 5, 889641) The prohibition, under the same Section, to holders of rights acquired previously to the Bill to transfer or sub let such rights to a Coloured person makes the proposed law retrospective in its effect.
('8', 372, 1, 6, 889843) (e) Section 128 contemplates the compulsory segregation of British Indians residing within certain proclaimed areas, to wit, the entire Witwatersrand District, and, if approved by this Honble House, would make it impossible for a very large number of British Indians even to remain in the Colony.
('8', 372, 1, 7, 890140) Your Petitioner would remind this Honble House that the large majority of British Indians resident in the Transvaal are to be found in the above mentioned areas, whilst the principle of compulsory segregation of British Indians under penalty is a direct extension of existing disabilities by indirect means, which disabilities the petitioning Association has consistently protested against.
('8', 372, 1, 8, 890531) 4. Your Petitioner ventures to assert that, inasmuch as these Sections are based upon race and class distinctions, they can never give satisfaction to the British Indian community.
('8', 372, 1, 9, 890712) Moreover, such distinctions cast an undeserved slur upon the community that your Petitioner has the honour to represent, as they must inevitably raise in the minds of the white Colonists of the Transvaal, feelings of contempt and scorn towards British Indians, thus increasing the difficulties unfortunately standing in the way of a better understanding between the two communities.
('8', 372, 1, 10, 891095) 5. In your Petitioners humble opinion, restrictions of the kind above referred to obviously confer absolutely no privileges upon British Indians, but, on the contrary, deprive them of many rights and much esteem that they at present possess.
('8', 372, 1, 11, 891337) 6. Your Petitioner further ventures to remind this Honble

('8', 373, 1, 3, 891697) 7. Wherefore your Petitioner humbly prays that this Honble House will be pleased to reject the provisions hereinbefore referred to, or togrant such other relief as to this Honble House may seem meet; and for this act, etc., etc.

('8', 373, 5, 8, 892120) JOHANNESBURG, June 15, 1908
('8', 373, 6, 9, 892148) TO THE HONBLE THE SPEAKER AND MEMBERS OF THE TRANSVAAL LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY PRETORIA
('8', 373, 7, 10, 892233) THE PETITION OF ESSOP ISMAIL MIA, IN HIS CAPACITY AS CHAIRMAN OF THE BRITISH INDIAN ASSOCIATION OF THE TRANSVAAL
('8', 373, 8, 11, 892346) HUMBLY SHEWETH THAT 1. Your Petitioner has read with grave concern Sections 68, 93, 94 and 172 of the Bill to consolidate and amend the law relating to Municipal Government, recently published in the Government Gazette of this Colony.
('8', 373, 8, 12, 892581) 2. In your Petitioners humble opinion, the above mentioned Sections, if they are approved by this Honble House, will impose very great hardship and loss upon the British Indian community resident in the Transvaal, will ruin many peaceable and law abiding citizens, and break up many an Indian home.
('8', 373, 8, 13, 892880) 3. Your Petitioner ventures to assert that, inasmuch as these Sections are based upon race and class distinctions, they can never give satisfaction to the British Indian community.
('8', 373, 8, 14, 893061) Moreover, such
('8', 373, 9, 15, 893076) 1 This was published under the title Transvaal Municipal Consolidation Bill: British Indian Protest.
('8', 374, 0, 1, 893177) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 375
('8', 374, 1, 2, 893222) distinctions cast an undeserved slur upon the community that your Petitioner has the honour to represent, as they must inevitably raise in the minds of the white Colonists of the Transvaal feelings of contempt and scorn towards British Indians, thus increasing the difficulties unfortunately standing in the way of a better understanding between the two communities.
('8', 374, 1, 3, 893589) 4. In your Petitioners humble opinion, the above provisions are open to serious objection on the ground that they are restrictive of the liberty of the subject, in that thereby it is sought to empower the municipalities: (a) to set apart new Asiatic Bazaars, thus reasserting the prin ciple of segregation of British Indians, a principle against which the petitioning Association [has] consistently pro tested; (b) to close existing Asiatic Bazaars without consulting the convenience of those who may be thereby affected and without guaranteeing to them fresh sites equally valuable and convenient (such uncertainty of tenure, as this Hon ble House will easily perceive, cannot but militate seriously against a settled and decent mode of life, and the erection of permanent and solid residential premises, by British Indians); (c) to arbitrarily refuse certain licences, including hawkers and pedlars licences, without the right of appeal from their decisions, thus striking a deadly blow at the long established businesses of Indian merchants, traders, haw kers, pedlars, and others, threatening them with immediate ruin; the licences which come under this last provision, may, under the Bill, be arbitrarily refused to those who, today, have the right of appeal from the adverse decisions of municipalities; (d) to indicate certain trades and businesses from which Bri tish Indians are excluded in any capacity, whether as would be licensees or as employees, thus restricting their means of earning an honest livelihood; (e) to frame regulations prohibiting British Indians respect ably dressed and well conducted from travelling upon municipal tram cars, thus imposing humiliation upon a highly civilized community and debasing it to the level of the aboriginal native of the country.
('8', 374, 1, 4, 895377) 5. In your Petitioners humble opinion, restrictions of the kind above referred to obviously confer absolutely no privileges upon
('8', 375, 0, 1, 895506) 376 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 375, 1, 2, 895548) British Indians, but, on the contrary, deprive them of many rights and much esteem that they at present possess.
('8', 375, 1, 3, 895661) 6. Your Petitioner further ventures to remind this Honble House that the imposition of further disabilities upon the resident British Indian population of the Transvaal will enormously intensify the irritation and bitterness of feeling already existing in the minds of many millions of His Majestys subjects in India.
('8', 375, 1, 4, 895979) 7. Wherefore, your Petitioner humbly prays that this Honble House will be pleased to reject the provisions hereinbefore referred to, or to grant such other relief as to this Honble House may seem meet; and for this act, etc., etc.

('8', 375, 2, 6, 896293) 208. JOHANNESBURG LETTER Sunday [June 16, 1908] GENERAL SMUTS The collapse of the settlement is drawing nearer each day.
('8', 375, 2, 7, 896414) But the situation has reached such a critical point that all that I write now may have lost its point or alternatively [my predictions] may have come to pass by the time this is published.
('8', 375, 2, 8, 896603) After Mr. Gandhi wrote the letter 1 to General Smuts, an attempt was made to arrange an interview with Mr. Leonard, but he was not available.
('8', 375, 2, 9, 896745) He is busy in connection with an important commission, so it appears he does not see anyone at present.
('8', 375, 2, 10, 896849) Having thus waited and received no reply from General Smuts, on Friday the 12th, Mr. Gandhi met Mr. Ward, who is a very able barrister, though not of the same calibre as Mr. Leonard.
('8', 375, 2, 11, 897032) Mr. Ward took the same view as Mr. Leonard, namely, that the Government had no alternative but to return the applications.
('8', 375, 2, 12, 897155) Mr. Gandhi then sent a telegram 2 to General Smuts saying that, if no reply was received from him, the case would be taken to the Supreme Court and that this was also the view of an eminent counsel.
('8', 375, 2, 13, 897354) While, on the one hand, the telegram was being sent, drafts were being prepared on the other for affidavits 3 by Mr. Ebra 
('8', 375, 3, 14, 897477) 1 Vide Letter to General Smuts, 6 6 1908 2 This has not been traced.

('8', 376, 1, 3, 897842) Meanwhile, a telegram was received from Mr. Smuts inviting [Mr. Gandhi] for an interview on Saturday the 13th, at 9 45 a.m.
('8', 376, 1, 4, 897966) at Winchester House.
('8', 376, 1, 5, 897987) In view of this, it was decided not to send the affidavits to Pretoria.
('8', 376, 1, 6, 898059) At the interview, General Smuts said that the new law would certainly be repealed and the Immigrants [Restriction] Act amended.
('8', 376, 1, 7, 898187) But he had still to consult his draftsmen in the legal department.
('8', 376, 1, 8, 898254) He therefore advised [Mr. Gandhi] to wait for a week.
('8', 376, 1, 9, 898308) He said, moreover, that the British Indian Association did not represent the entire Indian community, and that he had received a petition from [some] Indians requesting that the law be retained.
('8', 376, 1, 10, 898503) The Committee [of the British Indian Association] met on the same day at 11 oclock.
('8', 376, 1, 11, 898587) It was resolved at the meeting to wait for a week.
('8', 376, 1, 12, 898638) The meeting was attended by Mr. Essop Mia, Chairman, and a large number of other Indians.
('8', 376, 1, 13, 898728) It was also resolved that, if no final reply was received from General Smuts, a meeting should be held on Sunday, to which all the Indian [delegates] from outside Johan nesburg should also be invited and that the matter should then be made public.
('8', 376, 2, 14, 898976) LETTER TO SMUTS
('8', 376, 3, 15, 898992) After the meeting, Mr. Gandhi wrote the following letter to General Smuts.
('8', 376, 4, 16, 899067) How many of the demands made in this letter will be conceded depends on the communitys courage.

('8', 376, 5, 18, 899189) DISCUSSION ON ACT IN ENGLAND
('8', 376, 6, 19, 899218) There is a cable in todays papers saying that this question is being discussed in England, and another to the effect that it has been decided to repeal the obnoxious Act, and that committees have been set up in India to work for the protection of rights of Indians abroad.
('8', 376, 6, 20, 899491) Sir Richard Solomon gave an incomplete reply [to a question] on this subject and said that the Asiatic Act would be amended, not repealed.
('8', 376, 6, 21, 899630) I, for one, attach no importance to this reply.
('8', 376, 6, 22, 899678) The lesson to be drawn from the foregoing cable is that satya graha has struck deep roots and will daily grow in strength.
('8', 376, 6, 23, 899801) It also suggests that Mr. Ritch is ever active in England in the service of duty, without a moments respite.

('8', 377, 1, 2, 900056) PRETORIA NEWS
('8', 377, 2, 3, 900070) Pretoria News says: 1
('8', 377, 3, 4, 900092) We understand that, according to General Smuts promise to Mr. Gandhi, the Act will be repealed and that voluntary registration will be legalized under the Immigrants [Restriction] Act.
('8', 377, 3, 5, 900277) It will also contain a provision for appeal to a court of law.
('8', 377, 3, 6, 900340) This amendment is to be made in response to suggestions from the Imperial Government.
('8', 377, 3, 7, 900426) This paragraph appears in the news columns.
('8', 377, 3, 8, 900470) Commenting on it, the editor says: The Governors speech very wisely says little about Asiatics.
('8', 377, 3, 9, 900566) The surrender by the Government in that connection, as we have shown in another column, is complete; not only are they going to legalize voluntary registration, but they are going to repeal the Asiatic Act and recast the immigration Act.
('8', 377, 3, 10, 900804) In view of the Colonial Secretarys intention to repeal the Act, we advise Mr. Gandhi not to resume the satyagraha movement.
('8', 377, 3, 11, 900928) It is very clear that the Indian community has good friends in the Liberal Party.
('8', 377, 4, 12, 901010) SIR GEORGE FARRAR
('8', 377, 5, 13, 901028) Speaking in Parliament, Sir George said: The Progressive Party wants the Government to consult it.
('8', 377, 5, 14, 901127) There are precedents for that.
('8', 377, 5, 15, 901158) When the Government had trouble with the Asiatic law, they approached the Progressive Party for its help.
('8', 377, 5, 16, 901264) 2 They knew what happened in the case of the Indians.
('8', 377, 5, 17, 901318) Why would not the Government do in the case of the policemen what they did to the Indians?
('8', 377, 5, 18, 901409) Will they treat the policemen worse than they treated the Indians?
('8', 377, 5, 19, 901476) We thus see that the satyagrahis cases are being referred to on every occasion.
('8', 377, 5, 20, 901556) The same thing happened at a meeting of the Native Affairs Society on Tuesday evening when they cited the example of the Indian campaign.

('8', 378, 2, 5, 902185) SHAHJIS CASE
('8', 378, 3, 6, 902198) The case of Shahji and Maulabux came up on Friday.
('8', 378, 3, 7, 902249) But owing to the pressure of other business, the hearing was adjourned to the 24th.
('8', 378, 3, 8, 902333) When the case came up, Mr. Jordan said that he had received a threatening anonymous letter.
('8', 378, 3, 9, 902425) 1 He gave, a warning to persons writing such letters.
('8', 378, 3, 10, 902479) Shahjis lawyer, Mr. Van Diggelen stated that the letter in question was certainly not written by his clients.
('8', 378, 3, 11, 902589) Some hot heads among the Pathans were probably the authors.
('8', 378, 3, 12, 902649) In any case, the writing of anonymous letters is a bad habit and is a sure sign of weakness.
('8', 378, 3, 13, 902742) If this finds its way towriters of anonymous letters, let them note that they are bringing disgrace on the Indian community.
('8', 378, 4, 14, 902867) HARASSMENT IN VOLKSRUST
('8', 378, 5, 15, 902891) Syed Mahomed, an Indian, was returning last week from Durban.
('8', 378, 5, 16, 902953) He had with him the receipt for his application for voluntary registration.
('8', 378, 5, 17, 903029) Since it did not have his thumb impression, he was asked to detrain at Volksrust.
('8', 378, 5, 18, 903111) Corporal Cameron fixed his bail at 10. But when he was taken to the sergeant, the latter refused him bail.
('8', 378, 5, 19, 903218) Since it was a holiday, he had to remain in gaol for three days.
('8', 378, 5, 20, 903283) He was then released.
('8', 378, 5, 21, 903305) But who is to be held responsible for this harassment for three days?
('8', 378, 5, 22, 903375) This question has a point for every Indian.
('8', 378, 5, 23, 903419) The easiest and simplest way out of this is for Indians to take their courage in both hands and protest against every inconvenience they are put to.
('8', 378, 5, 24, 903568) It is said that there was an Indian behind this ill treatment meted out to Mr. Syed Mahomed.
('8', 378, 5, 25, 903661) If this is true, it only bears out the saying that the axe cannot chop wood unless it has a wooden handle.

('8', 378, 6, 27, 903810) 1 Shahji was charged before Magistrate Jordan with incitement to commit grievous bodily harm, and the other with committing an assault on Essop Mia.
('8', 378, 6, 28, 903959) The anonymous letter purported to be from a Pathan who threatened to kill the Magistrate if he gave a judgment adverse to the accused.

('8', 379, 6, 6, 904343) 210. CAUSE OF MURDERS IN NATAL
('8', 379, 7, 7, 904374) Following upon our article 2 on the murders committed among the Natal Indians, a correspondent states that the growing prevalence of adultery among Indians is the cause of these murders.
('8', 379, 7, 8, 904561) He observes that [the cause of] most of these murders can be traced to women.
('8', 379, 7, 9, 904639) This is regrettable, if true.
('8', 379, 7, 10, 904669) What we write now is unlikely to fall into the hands of those who are busy committing murders or others who are the cause of them.
('8', 379, 7, 11, 904800) But the readers of this journal must think [this matter over].
('8', 379, 7, 12, 904863) Every thoughtful person can help in solving these problems.
('8', 379, 7, 13, 904923) If it is true that adultery is on the increase among the Indian youth, that is a sign of our degeneracy.
('8', 379, 7, 14, 905028) We are in the habit of comparing our vices with those of the whites and if we have some in common, we take no further notice of them.
('8', 379, 7, 15, 905162) This attitude reveals how depraved we are.
('8', 379, 7, 16, 905205) Following that line of thinking, we conclude that the whites are superior to us and that they have attained the acme of virtue.
('8', 379, 7, 17, 905333) In fact, the whites are generally not superior to us.
('8', 379, 7, 18, 905387) It is equally false that we cannot become more virtuous.
('8', 379, 7, 19, 905444) There is no more fallacious argument than that we may indulge in adultery because the whites do so.
('8', 379, 7, 20, 905544) Their adultery is a different sort of thing, and even in their case, a strenuous effort is being made by their priests and reformers to eradicate the vice.
('8', 379, 8, 21, 905700) 1 This was sent at 7.40 p.m.
('8', 379, 8, 22, 905729) to Smuts Private Secretary in reply to the latters telegram which said: Can you please be at the Railway offices at 9.40 tomorrow to meet Mr. Smuts for a few minutes. 2 Vide Crime Wave in Natal,6 6 1908

('8', 380, 1, 6, 906102) We therefore need an enterprising spirit.
('8', 380, 1, 7, 906144) It is a fact of experience that the habit of adultery daily undermines the strength of people among whom it is widespread.
('8', 380, 1, 8, 906267) The Indian youth, therefore, need to give this problem their earnest attention.
('8', 380, 1, 9, 906347) If we observe [conditions among] whites for purposes of comparison, we shall find that Purity Societies are being set up among them.
('8', 380, 1, 10, 906480) Their priests are working actively to prevent the young people from going astray.
('8', 380, 1, 11, 906562) We know that in Bombay the Salvation Army is active.
('8', 380, 1, 12, 906615) In the Cape, the Orange River Colony and the Transvaal, the Rev.
('8', 380, 1, 13, 906680) Mr. Myer has been exhorting the young with the same end in view.
('8', 380, 1, 14, 906745) These societies do not require funds.
('8', 380, 1, 15, 906783) They only require the services of devoted men, who are virtuous in thought and deed.
('8', 380, 1, 16, 906868) Let it be remembered that Rome, Greece and the other nations that fell were destroyed mainly because of the prevalence of adultery [in those societies].

('8', 380, 3, 19, 907096) The Cape Parliament is in session.
('8', 380, 3, 20, 907131) The Immigration Act and the Cape Licenses Act are oppressive measures.
('8', 380, 3, 21, 907202) The Cape Indians are in a better position to secure redress in respect of these laws than are the Indians in the other Colonies [in the matter of their grievances].
('8', 380, 3, 22, 907367) For they have franchise.
('8', 380, 3, 23, 907392) If they try hard enough, they can get both.
('8', 380, 3, 24, 907436) these Acts amended.
('8', 380, 3, 25, 907456) The Immigration Regulations have been published again in the Gazette.
('8', 380, 3, 26, 907526) Many of the conditions that the laws stipulate are difficult to fulfil.
('8', 380, 3, 27, 907598) It is the duty of the Cape Indians to fight against these laws.
('8', 380, 3, 28, 907662) The same is true of the General Dealers Act.
('8', 380, 3, 29, 907707) If the Indian community in South Africa wants to live respectably, it should be prepared for suffering.
('8', 380, 3, 30, 907811) In order to fight the hardships imposed on it by the Government, it should be prepared to accept [further self imposed] 1 hardships, or if it is content to live in igno ranceand filthit should then accept oppression by the Govern ment.
('8', 380, 3, 31, 908047) One must be prepared to die in order to be able to live.
('8', 380, 3, 32, 908104) And in order to win ones rights, one must do ones duty.

('8', 381, 2, 3, 908327) We publish alongside of this, as a supplement to todays issue, a photograph 1 a memorial column erected in Johannesburg.
('8', 381, 2, 4, 908448) It was erected by public subscription at the end of the Boer War.
('8', 381, 2, 5, 908514) At the moment, it is the only symbol in South Africa [that] perpetuates the memory of Indians there.
('8', 381, 2, 6, 908615) The first one is a close view of the column and the inscription on it.
('8', 381, 2, 7, 908686) The second affords a view of the column amidst As surroun dings.
('8', 381, 2, 8, 908751) The photograph thus serves to give an idea of the elevation at which the column is built.
('8', 381, 2, 9, 908841) Visible at some distance from the column is the boundary of Sir George Farrars farm.
('8', 381, 2, 10, 908926) The column is of carved stone set in cement.
('8', 381, 2, 11, 908971) It is fenced in with iron palings so as to avoid risk of damage to the inscription on the marble tablet set in it.
('8', 381, 2, 12, 909086) The column is located near the Johannesburg Observatory (the department which studies atmospheric phenomena).
('8', 381, 2, 13, 909196) That is to say, it stands atop the highest eminence in Johannesburg thanks to the concerted efforts of the people.
('8', 381, 2, 14, 909311) The large marble slab is set on the eastern face of the column.
('8', 381, 2, 15, 909375) It carries the following inscription: To the sacred memory of British officers and other ranks and Indian sepoys who lid down their lives on the fields of battle in South Africa between 1899 1902. These lines are inscribed in Hindi, Urdu and English.
('8', 381, 2, 16, 909626) A marble slab has been set on each of the other three faces of the column.
('8', 381, 2, 17, 909701) Thefollowing words are inscribed on them in this order: Mussalman; Christian Zoroastrian; Hindu Sikh.

('8', 381, 4, 20, 909865) VEINS OF WEALTH
('8', 381, 5, 21, 909881) Thus the circulation of wealth among a people resembles the circulation of blood in the body.
('8', 381, 5, 22, 909975) When circulation of blood is rapid, it may indicate any of these things: robust health, [effects of] exercise,or a feeling of shame or fever.
('8', 381, 5, 23, 910117) There is a flush of the body which is
('8', 381, 6, 24, 910155) 1 This should be "two photographs".
('8', 382, 0, 1, 910191) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 383
('8', 382, 1, 2, 910236) indicative of health, and another which is a sign of gangrene.
('8', 382, 1, 3, 910299) Further more, the concentration of blood at one spot is harmful to the body and, similarly, concentration of wealth at one place proves to be the nations undoing.
('8', 382, 1, 4, 910462) Let us suppose that two sailors are shipwrecked on an uninhabited coast They are then obliged to produce food and other necessaries of life through their own labour.
('8', 382, 1, 5, 910628) If they both keep good health and work in amity, they may build a good house, till the land and lay by something for the future.
('8', 382, 1, 6, 910757) All these things would constitute real wealth.
('8', 382, 1, 7, 910804) If both of them work equally well they will have equal shares.
('8', 382, 1, 8, 910867) Therefore, all that [economic] science would have to say about their case is that they had acquired a right to an equal share in the fruits of their labour.
('8', 382, 1, 9, 911024) Let us suppose now that after a while one of them feels dis contented.
('8', 382, 1, 10, 911095) So they divide the land and each one works on his land by himself and on his own account.
('8', 382, 1, 11, 911185) Let us suppose that at a critical time one of them falls ill.
('8', 382, 1, 12, 911247) He would then approach the other for help.
('8', 382, 1, 13, 911290) The latter might reply: I shall do this work for you, but on condition that you do the same amount of work for me when required.
('8', 382, 1, 14, 911419) You must undertake in writing to work on my field when required for the same number of hours that I work [for you now]. Suppose further that the disabled mans illness continues and that every time he has to give a written promise to the other, healthy person.
('8', 382, 1, 15, 911679) What will be the position of the reduced to utter poverty.
('8', 382, 1, 16, 911738) For, during the time that the invalid was laid up, his labour was unavailable.
('8', 382, 1, 17, 911817) Even assuming that the friend was very hard working, it is obvious that the time which he devoted to the ailing mans land was at the expense of work on his own.
('8', 382, 1, 18, 911978) This means that the combined property of the two would be less than it would have been otherwise.
('8', 382, 1, 19, 912076) Also, the relation in which the two stood to each other has altered.
('8', 382, 1, 20, 912145) The sick man becomes a debtor, and can only offer his labour [as payment towards the debt].
('8', 382, 1, 21, 912237) Suppose now that the healthy man decided to make use of the documents in his possession.
('8', 382, 1, 22, 912326) He would then find it possible wholly to abstain, from workthat is, be idle.
('8', 382, 1, 23, 912403) If he chose, he could exact further pledges 1 from the man who has recovered.
('8', 382, 1, 24, 912481) No one can attribute any illegality to such a transaction.
('8', 382, 1, 25, 912540) If now a stranger were to arrive on the scene, he would find that one of the two men had become wealthy and the other had lost his well being.
('8', 382, 1, 26, 912683) He would also see one of them passing his days in idle luxury and the other in want, though labouring hard.
('8', 382, 1, 27, 912791) The reader will note from this that claiming the fruits of anothers labour as of right
('8', 382, 2, 28, 912878) 1 Pledges of bonded labour in return for the provision of the debtor's current needs
('8', 383, 0, 1, 912963) 384 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 383, 1, 2, 913005) leads to a diminution of real wealth.
('8', 383, 1, 3, 913043) Let us consider another illustration.
('8', 383, 1, 4, 913081) [Suppose that] three men established a kingdom 1 and then they all lived separately.
('8', 383, 1, 5, 913166) Each of them raised a different crop which the others could also avail them selves of.
('8', 383, 1, 6, 913253) Suppose, further, that one of them, in order to save the time of all the three, gave up farming and undertook to arrange the transfer of commodities from one to the other, receiving in return a quantity of food grains.
('8', 383, 1, 7, 913472) If this man provided the [required] commodity 2 at the right time, all of them would prosper.
('8', 383, 1, 8, 913566) Now suppose that he kept back some of the grain he was to transfer.
('8', 383, 1, 9, 913634) Then suppose there set in a period of scarcity, and the middleman offered the stolen corn at an exorbitant price.
('8', 383, 1, 10, 913748) In this way he could reduce both the farmers to poverty and employ them as labourers.
('8', 383, 1, 11, 913834) This would be a case of obvious injustice.
('8', 383, 1, 12, 913877) This is, however, the way the merchants of today manage their affairs.
('8', 383, 1, 13, 913948) We can also see that in consequence of this fraudulent practice the wealth of the three, taken collectively, will be less than it would have been if the [middle]man had behaved honestly.
('8', 383, 1, 14, 914135) The other two farmers have done less work [than they could have].
('8', 383, 1, 15, 914201) Because they could not obtain the supplies they wanted, their labour did not fructify to the fullest, and the stolen commodities 3 the hands of the dishonest middleman were not put to the most effective use.
('8', 383, 1, 16, 914409) We can therefore reckon with mathematical accuracy how far the estimate of a nations wealth depends on the manner in which that wealth has been acquired.
('8', 383, 1, 17, 914563) We cannot estimate a nations wealth on the basis of the quantity of cash it possesses.
('8', 383, 1, 18, 914650) Cash in the hands of an individual may be a token of perseverance, skill and prosperity, or of harmful luxuries, merciless tyranny and chicanery.
('8', 383, 1, 19, 914796) Our way of estimating wealth not only takes into account the moral attributes [of thedifferent modes of acquiring it] but is also sound mathematically.
('8', 383, 1, 20, 914948) One stock of money is such that it has created ten times as much in the gathering of it.
('8', 383, 1, 21, 915037) Another is such that it has annihilated ten times as much in the gathering of it.
('8', 383, 1, 22, 915119) To lay down directions for the making of money without regardto moral considerations is therefore a pursuit that bespeaks of mans insolence.
('8', 383, 1, 23, 915260) There is nothing more disgraceful to man than the

('8', 384, 1, 3, 915547) Buy in the cheapest market?
('8', 384, 1, 4, 915575) Yes, but what made your market cheap?
('8', 384, 1, 5, 915613) Char coal may be cheap among roof timbers after a fire and the bricks of buildings brought down by an earthquake may be cheap.
('8', 384, 1, 6, 915740) But no one therefore will make bold to assert that fire and earthquake redound to the nations benefit.
('8', 384, 1, 7, 915843) Again, sell in the dearest market?
('8', 384, 1, 8, 915878) Yes, but what made your market dear?
('8', 384, 1, 9, 915915) You made good profit today from the sale of your bread.
('8', 384, 1, 10, 915971) But was it by extorting the last cowrie from a dying man?
('8', 384, 1, 11, 916029) Or, did you sell it to a rich man who will tomorrow appropriate all that you have?
('8', 384, 1, 12, 916112) Or did you give it to a bandit on his way to pillaging your bank?
('8', 384, 1, 13, 916178) Probably you will not be able to answer any of these questions, for you do not know.
('8', 384, 1, 14, 916263) But there is one question you can answer, namely, whether you sold it justly and at a reasonable price.
('8', 384, 1, 15, 916367) And justice is all that matters.
('8', 384, 1, 16, 916400) It is your duty to act so that no one suffers through your actions.

('8', 385, 2, 3, 916906) JOHANNESBURG, June 22, 1908 Various statements have appeared in the Press regarding the charge of breach by the Colonial Secretary of the compromise between the Government and the Asiatic communities.
('8', 385, 2, 4, 917107) Hitherto, owing to the delicate nature of the negotiations that were going on between the Government and the Asiatic communities, it has not been possible to state the case before the public.
('8', 385, 2, 5, 917299) I am sorry to say that the negotiations came to an abrupt and unsatisfactory end today.
('8', 385, 2, 6, 917387) I use the term unsatisfactory as applicable not merely to the Asiatics, but to the whole Empire.
('8', 385, 2, 7, 917484) General Smuts was willing to repeal the offending Asiatic Act, which has cost the Asiatics treasures of money and much trouble, including incarceration of over two hundred innocent Asiatics, mostly British.
('8', 385, 2, 8, 917691) This shows that General Smuts was, and still is, under promise to repeal the Act.
('8', 385, 2, 9, 917773) But if he was willing to carry out the letter of the compromise, he wanted to break the spirit of it.
('8', 385, 2, 10, 917875) For it will not be argued that the material position of the Asiatics was, under and after the compromise, to be lower than under the Asiatic Act.
('8', 385, 2, 11, 918021) Yet such was General Smuts draft which I was today pained to study and, so far as I was concerned, to reject.
('8', 385, 2, 12, 918131) The draft measure proposed to treat the following as prohibited immigrants: (a) Asiatics possessing educational qualifications prescribed by the Immigrants Restriction Act.
('8', 385, 2, 13, 918304) (b) Asiatics, whether in or out of the Colony, holding Dutch registration certificates under Law 3 of 1885, for which they paid 3. (c) Other Asiatics who were residents of the Transvaal before the war, and who could prove before a court of law their previous domicile.
('8', 385, 2, 14, 918573) (d) Those Asiatics whose claims have been rejected by Mr. Chamney.
('8', 385, 2, 15, 918640) (For these it is contended only that they
('8', 385, 3, 16, 918682) 1 This was published in Indian Opinion, 27 6 1908, under the title Mr. Gandhi Speaks.
('8', 385, 3, 17, 918768) It was also published in The Star among other papers.
('8', 385, 3, 18, 918822) The Star version is, however, unavailable.
('8', 385, 3, 19, 918865) Ritch forwarded a copy of the letter to the India Office.
('8', 385, 3, 20, 918923) He described it as a circular letter which set out the issues between the Transvaal Government and the British Indians.
('8', 386, 0, 1, 919043) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 387
('8', 386, 1, 2, 919088) should have the right to have their claims investigated by a judicial tribunal, not finally disposed of by an adminis trative official.) In rejecting these claims for consideration and adjudication, not for admission ipso facto, General Smuts has misread the passive resistance struggle.
('8', 386, 1, 3, 919376) It was undertaken, not for selfish purposes, but for the benefit of the Asiatics as a whole, and, shall I add, even the Empire.
('8', 386, 1, 4, 919504) Moreover, he has wrecked a whole compromise to avoid the possible accession to the Asiatic population of the Colony of two thousand Asiatics as an outside figure.
('8', 386, 1, 5, 919667) I call these people an accession, but, in fact, they are already domiciled residents of the Colony, though General Smuts draft ignored their rights.
('8', 386, 1, 6, 919816) The position of the Asiatics is simple.
('8', 386, 1, 7, 919856) They must revert to the condition that prevailed in January last in this matter, and they have been advised to withdraw their voluntary application forms.
('8', 386, 1, 8, 920011) 1 General Smuts has declined to return them.
('8', 386, 1, 9, 920056) If he had the courage to face the passive resisters, he would return them without much ado.
('8', 386, 1, 10, 920148) Asiatics were labouring under a cloud of suspicion up to January last.
('8', 386, 1, 11, 920219) Mr. Duncan had levelled the charge and it was repeated, even in the highest places, that there was an organized illicit entry of Asiatics.
('8', 386, 1, 12, 920358) 2 The fact that over 7,600 out of 9,000 have already proved their bona fides disposes of the charge.
('8', 386, 1, 13, 920459) It was in order to refute that foul charge that voluntary registration was tendered, and for no other reason.
('8', 386, 1, 14, 920569) The Asiatics, therefore, approach the public with clean hands.
('8', 386, 1, 15, 920632) Moreover, they have shown by their sufferings that they have a right to command sympathy from a humanitarian public.
('8', 386, 1, 16, 920749) Lastly, they have shown, by some of their leaders being severely assaulted by their own countrymen, that they are just as eager to serve the Government as they are to serve their countrymen.
('8', 386, 1, 17, 920940) General Smuts Act will be that of the Government and the Governments will be the white mensmostly British.
('8', 386, 1, 18, 921047) When I explai ned the compromise to my countrymen, the less thinking among them said: Do not trust the white man.
('8', 386, 1, 19, 921161) Repeal of the Act should precede voluntary registration and not succeed it. I told them that that was not a dignified position to take up.
('8', 386, 1, 20, 921300) In tampering with the compromise, I venture to say that General Smuts does not know what he is doing.

('8', 387, 7, 16, 922485) [PRETORIA, June 22, 1908]
('8', 387, 8, 17, 922511) We regret to announce that all efforts to avoid a breach of the settlement, arrived at last January between the Government and the Transvaal Asiatics, have proved unsuccessful.
('8', 387, 9, 18, 922688) At the request of the Colonial Secretary, Mr. Gandhi waited on him this morning and was permitted to peruse the draft amendment to the Immigration Restriction Act proposed by the Government.
('8', 387, 9, 19, 922879) General Smuts intimated that it was the intention of the Government to repeal the Asiatic Registration Act.
('8', 387, 10, 20, 922987) 1 This is taken from a precis of events in the Transvaal sent by Ritch along with his letter of October 6, 1908 to the Colonial Office.
('8', 387, 10, 21, 923123) 2 This was republished in Indian Opinion under the title The Transvaal Trouble: General Smuts Plays False.
('8', 388, 0, 1, 923230) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 389
('8', 388, 1, 2, 923275) After perusing the Act, Mr. Gandhi had an interview with the Colonial Secre tary, and raised the following points: (a) The position of the Asiatics who had made voluntary application for registration, having given their finger prints, and who for some reason or other have not received their permits.
('8', 388, 1, 3, 923576) Mr. Gandhi asked that, in case[s] where permits were refused, an application or appeal should lie from the Registrar of Asiatics to some judicial officer; (b) he also asked that those Indians outside South Africa, whoare in possession of residential passports issued by the Republican Government in return for the registration fee of 3, should be permitted on returning from India to register voluntarily; (c) that the educational exemption should be maintained in the new Act as it was in the old; (d) that genuine refugees domiciled in the Transvaal before the war, now in India or elsewhere, who were in possession of the Republican passport or not, be permitted, on producing evidence, to return and register voluntarily.
('8', 388, 2, 4, 924302) With regard to the education exemption, General Smuts argued that they had no exemption under the original law.
('8', 388, 2, 5, 924414) He declined to make provisions for appeal from the Registrar of Asiatics in cases where voluntary registration had been refused.
('8', 388, 2, 6, 924543) He also declined to offer facilities for the return of Asiatics at present out of the country, who were genuine refugees, or possessed the Republican residential passport.
('8', 388, 3, 7, 924715) The interview was a brief one, and the Colonial Secretary, we understand, intimated to Mr. Gandhi that if he, as leader of the Indian community, was prepared to accept the proposed amendments to the Immigration Restriction Act, the Asiatic Law Amendment Act would be withdrawn.
('8', 388, 3, 8, 924993) The Colonial Secretary would proceed to introduce a Bill legalizing the registration in the existing Registration Act.
('8', 388, 4, 9, 925112) Mr. Gandhi then withdrew, and during the course of an interview gave a representative of this paper authority to make the above statement.
('8', 388, 4, 10, 925251) He stated that he would immediately apply to the Supreme Court for an order calling on Mr. Chamney
('8', 388, 5, 11, 925350) 1 Indian Opinion published the following report of a statement by General Smuts: In connection with Mr. Gandhi's statement, we have received a statement from the Colonial Secretary to the effect that the repeal of the Asiatic Law Amendment Act was not part of the arrangement with the Asiatics, as was apparent from letters constituting the arrangements.
('8', 388, 5, 12, 925705) The Colonial Secretary was willing to meet the Indian community and repeal Act 2 of 1907 and to treat Indians in future coming into the Transvaal as prohibited Indians under the ImmigrantsRestriction Act if the leaders of the Asiatic community would agree to the amendment of the Act which the Colonial Secretary proposed.
('8', 388, 5, 13, 926028) These proposed amendments were submitted to Mr. Gandhi, and they did not at all satisfy him for various reasons, which he advanced, and therefore he was informed that nothing remained to be done but to abide by the agreed terms of the compromise, as the Colonial Secretary was unwilling to repeal Act 2 of 1907 and then to find an agitation started afresh against the ImmigrantsAct.
('8', 388, 5, 14, 926411) Voluntary registration would not be legalized under Act 2 of 1907 but under a separate measure, according to the compromise.

('8', 389, 4, 5, 926745) [JOHANNESBURG, June 22, 1908]
('8', 389, 5, 6, 926775) Mr. Gandhi was seen last night by a representative of The Transvaal Leader, and, asked to state what course it is now intended to adopt, Mr. Gandhi said: Throughout the negotiations the leaders of the Indian community have been kept informed, as also, indeed, the general body of the community, of what was going on.
('8', 389, 5, 7, 927092) Though, therefore, the decision of General Smuts has come to them as a painful surprise, they have not been taken altogether unawares.
('8', 389, 5, 8, 927227) When it first became known that there was no likelihood of the Act being repealed, many Indians wrote to Mr. Chamney asking him to return their application forms and other documents filed with him voluntarily.
('8', 389, 5, 9, 927437) These documents have not been returned.
('8', 389, 5, 10, 927477) The Supreme Court will be approached immediately, and if the documents are returned, that at once places the Indian community in the position in which it was before the compromise that is to say, every Indian is liable to be prosecuted, under the Asiatic Act, for non registration; but if the action were unsuccessful, even then so far as I am aware, it is not the intention of the Asiatics to allow voluntary registration to be legalized anyhow.
('8', 389, 5, 11, 927924) Immediately on my return from Pretoria, a meeting of the committee was held, and the members were very enthusiastic.
('8', 389, 5, 12, 928041) They realized that the whole of the passive resistance will have to be gone through all over again, and they seem to me to be ready for it.
('8', 389, 5, 13, 928181) We are holding on Wednesday next at three oclock, in front of the Hamidia Mosque, a mass meeting of British Indians throughout the Colony, 2 Delegates have been invited by telegram from all parts of the Colony.
('8', 389, 5, 14, 928392) A series of resolutions will be passed at the meeting.
('8', 389, 6, 15, 928447) 1 In the same issue of Indian Opinion, it was reported that Mr. Ebrahim Aswat had applied to the Supreme Court, supported by affidavits from Essop Ismail Mia and Gandhiji (pp.
('8', 389, 6, 16, 928623) 313 6) for a return of their application forms for voluntary registration.
('8', 389, 6, 17, 928698) The application had been set down for Friday, July 3, at 11 o'clock, 2 Vide Speech at Mass Meeting, 24 6 1908

('8', 390, 1, 2, 928853) I cannot help saying that, having yielded on the principle of the repeal of the Act, General Smuts is very unreasonable in refusing to recognize what I consider to be the very moderate and just suggestions.

('8', 390, 6, 10, 929393) As, when I accepted the compromise with the Government, it never was my intention to accept legalization under the Asiatic Act, I beg to apply for a return of my application and other documents possessed by you.

('8', 391, 3, 4, 930144) PETITION OF EBRAHIM ISMAIL ASWAT OF VEREENIGING FOR THE RETURN OF PAPERS AND DOCUMENTS GIVEN TO MONTFORD C HAMNEY OF P RETORIA Ebrahim Ismail Aswat of Vereeniging humbly submits to Their Lordships the honble Judges of the Supreme Court that (1) he is a wholesale and retail Indian trader of Vereeniging; (2) he has been resident in the Transvaal for the last 19 years; (3) he attended some of the meetings 2 of the British Indian Association at Johannesburg held in January and February last; (4) it was stated at these meetings that a compromise had been arrived at between the Indian community and the Government in regard to the agitation against the Asiatic Law Amendment Act; (5) the terms of the compromise were explained by Mr. M. K. Gandhi, Honorary Secretary, British Indian Association, as follows: (a) residents of the Transvaal would apply voluntarily, within a period of three months, for registration certificates in a form to be agreed upon between the leaders of the Indian community and the Government; (b) those who were outside the Transvaal but had domiciliary rights in the Colony and possessed the right of re entry, would also be eligible for voluntary registration; (c) on the fulfilment by Asiatics of their obligations in accordance with the terms of the compromise, the Government would repeal the Act; and those Asiatics who had registered voluntarily would not in any way be subject to the operation of the Asiatic Registration Act.
('8', 391, 3, 5, 931606) (6) As far as he is aware, most Indians had applied for voluntary reg istration.
('8', 391, 3, 6, 931687) (7) In view of the assurances referred to above, he made his appli 
('8', 391, 4, 7, 931755) 1 This was drafted about the same time as Gandhiji's and Essop Mia's affidavits; vide Johannesburg Letter, 14 6 1908. It is likely that Gandhiji himself drafted it after consulting Barrister Ward.
('8', 391, 4, 8, 931952) In any case, it was filed in the court before that of Gandhiji who mentions it in his affidavit; vide Affidavit, 23 6 1908. It was published in Indian Opinion as specially reported for that journal.

('8', 392, 1, 2, 932272) cation to Mr. Chamney in the month of March, 1908, in the form 1 attached herewith, which bore his signature and his finger prints.
('8', 392, 1, 3, 932404) (8) He, along with hundreds of other Indians, had thus fulfilled all the requirements in the application, ignoring the risk involved in doing so in view of the dissatisfaction that arose among certain Indians following the compromise.
('8', 392, 1, 4, 932639) (9) He had done his best to assist the Government to carry out the terms of the compromise in so far as the Indian part of it was con cerned.
('8', 392, 1, 5, 932781) (10) He is now informed by the Chairman of the British Indian Association that the Government does not intend to introduce any Bill to repeal the Act, nor will it allow those Asiatics who are outside the Colony to apply for voluntary registration.
('8', 392, 1, 6, 933029) (11) For these reasons, he does not wish to accept a certificate of voluntary registration and has asked Mr. Chamney to return his application referred to above, the permit issued to him under the Peace Preservation Ordinance and his certificate of registration under the Act of 1885 which he gave to Mr. Chamney when making his application.
('8', 392, 1, 7, 933371) (12) Mr. Chamney has not returned the said application and other documents.
('8', 392, 1, 8, 933447) (13) It was not under the Asiatic Law Amendment Act that he had made the application for registration; he had done that of his own free will.
('8', 392, 1, 9, 933589) (14) The last date appointed by the Government for receiving applications was November 30, 1907, as can be ascertained by reference to the Government Gazette of November 1. (15) He has not received the certificate of registration as per his application referred to above and in the circumstances stated above he does not wish to accept such certificate.
('8', 392, 1, 10, 933943) (16) He therefore prays for an order on Mr. Chamney directing to return his application, or for any other relief that the honble Court may deem fit to grant.

('8', 393, 2, 4, 934427) of Johannesburg, and Chairman of the British Indian Association.
('8', 393, 2, 5, 934492) 2. I have read the Petition 2 Ebrahim Ismail Aswat of Vere eniging, dated the 23rd day of June, 1908. 3. At the several meetings of the British Indian Association referred to in the said petition I presided, and some of these meetings were attended by several thousand Indians.
('8', 393, 2, 6, 934770) 4. As the British Indian Association has been informed by M. K. Gandhi of Johannesburg, As Honorary Secretary, to the effect that the Government may not repeal the Asiatic Act No.
('8', 393, 2, 7, 934950) 2 of 1907, the British Indian Association has decided to advise all British Indians to withdraw their voluntary applications for registration and other documents handed to Montford Chamney of Pretoria.
('8', 393, 2, 8, 935152) 5. I have also applied for the return of my application and documents, but they have not yet been returned.
('8', 393, 2, 9, 935260) 6. It was at very great personal risk that I and my fellow countrymen have assisted the Government to carry out the terms of the compromise referred to in the said petition so far as the Indian part of it was concerned.

Gandhi of Johannesburg, Attorney, [and] Honorary Secretary of the British Indian Association, do hereby solemnly and sincerely declare as follows: 1. I have read the Petition 1 Ebrahim Ismail Aswat of Vere eniging, dated the 23rd day of June, 1908, and the Affidavit 2 Essop Ismail Mia, the Chairman of the British Indian Association, dated the 23rd day of June, 1908. 2. The statement made by the said Ebrahim Ismail Aswat, in his Petition, with reference to the compromise, is correct.
('8', 394, 2, 4, 936392) 3. I was sentenced, together with many other Indians, to be imprisoned for not having complied with the Asiatic Law Amendment Act No.
('8', 394, 2, 5, 936526) 2 of 1907, which I believed, and do still believe, to be contrary to my independence as a free man, and my conscience.
('8', 394, 2, 6, 936645) 4. While I was undergoing sentence of Imprisonment in the month of January, 1908, negotiations were put forward, I believe by the Government, for a compromise with the Indian community.
('8', 394, 2, 7, 936831) 5. A letter 3 placed before me for my signature, copy of which is hereto attached.
('8', 394, 2, 8, 936914) 6. As that letter was not considered by me to be satisfactory, and as it left the question of the inapplicability of the Asiatic Act to those who voluntarily registered open, I made certain alterations 4. Copy of the letter as altered by me is also hereto attached.
('8', 394, 2, 9, 937180) The saidletter was then signed by Leung Quinn, Chairman of the Chinese Association, and Thambi Naidoo, a British Indian, both of whom were my fellow prisoners, and myself.

('8', 394, 2, 11, 937460) 8. At the interview I had with the Colonial Secretary, the repeal of the Asiatic Law Amendment Act was discussed, and the promise given definitely there and then that, if the Asiatics applied for voluntary registration, the Act would be repealed.

('8', 395, 1, 3, 938068) 9. After the said interview, my fellow prisoners and myself were discharged 10. On the 3rd day of February, I had another interview with the Colonial Secretary, and the repeal of the Act, as well as other matters, was discussed, and the promise made to me and referred to above was repeated; though, at the said interview, the Colonial Secretary, at the time I took leave, added, Remember, if there is a single recalcitrant Asiatic who does not take out voluntary registration, I shall enforce the Act against that man, or some words to that effect, which I took to mean that the vast majority of the Asiatics then resident in the Colony would have to take out voluntary registration certificates to bring about the repeal of Ass Act 11. After that, correspondence passed between the Colonial Secretary and myself confirming the question of repeal.
('8', 395, 1, 4, 938917) 12. To my surprise, however, I saw a letter 1 signed by the Private Secretary to the Colonial Secretary, stating that even voluntary registrants would be brought under the said Act.
('8', 395, 1, 5, 939099) 13. I have since ascertained that it is the intention of the Government not to Apply the said Act to those who have voluntary registered, but they decline to give any assurance with reference to the repeal of the Act.
('8', 395, 1, 6, 939317) 14. This news has created a great commotion amongst the Asiatics, and they have demanded the return of their voluntary applications for registration and documents handed to Montford Chamney of Pretoria.
('8', 395, 1, 7, 939520) 15. When the compromise was completed, it gavedissa tisfaction to a certain section of the Indian community, by reason of my having accepted, under authority of public meetings held at the time, the principle of identification by digit impressions; and, in my desire to carry out the compact with the Government, I proceeded to the said Montford Chamney, on Monday the 10th February last to make myapplication, and I was very severely assaulted by those who were dissatisfied with the compromise.
('8', 395, 1, 8, 940017) 16. It is within my knowledge that many Indians, in order to carry out the compromise and to help the Government, had to suffer much inconvenience and undertook great personal risk.

('8', 396, 4, 7, 940536) It was hoped that Monday would see the end of the law.
('8', 396, 4, 8, 940591) On that very day it was made known that the law would stay for the present at any rate.
('8', 396, 4, 9, 940679) Mr. Smuts told Mr. Gandhi on Saturday: Please see me on Monday.
('8', 396, 4, 10, 940743) One or two minor points remain to be considered.
('8', 396, 4, 11, 940792) All else is settled.[The Transvaal] Leader wrote editorially on Monday that it had been decided to repeal the Act.
('8', 396, 4, 12, 940907) Mr. Gandhi met Mr. Smuts on Monday.
('8', 396, 4, 13, 940943) He was shown a printed draft of the proposed Bill repealing the Act.
('8', 396, 4, 14, 941012) If the Indian community approved the draft, the Bill would be passed and the Act repealed.
('8', 396, 4, 15, 941103) The temptation was great.
('8', 396, 4, 16, 941129) It was an excellent Bill from the point of view of those who had registered voluntarily or might do so in future.
('8', 396, 4, 17, 941243) It did not contain any of the objectionable provisions of the obnoxious Act.
('8', 396, 4, 18, 941320) There was, however, a but about the Bill.
('8', 396, 4, 19, 941362) Accepting it meant forgoing rights as under: (1) Even educated persons would not be allowed to enter [except on a temporary visit].
('8', 396, 4, 20, 941494) (2) Even those who hold 3 Dutch registers may not enter.
('8', 396, 4, 21, 941551) (3) Other [Asiatic] refugees [from the Boer War] may not enter.
('8', 396, 4, 22, 941615) (4) If the applications now being examined by Mr. Chamney rejected, there is no appeal against his [administrative] decision.
('8', 396, 5, 23, 941741) If we agreed to forgo these rights, the Immigrants[Restriction] Act would be amended and the obnoxious Act repealed.
('8', 396, 6, 24, 941858) 1 In effect, the points made by Gandhiji in his letter to Smuts of June 13 were not acceded to.
('8', 396, 6, 25, 941954) Addressing the mass meeting of June 24, Essop Mia, Chairman, made the following points: (a) the evidence about the claims to domicile in the Transvaal should be taken from voluntary registrants in a public and judicial manner, so that the reasons for any official decision could not be kept secret; and (b) they would not sell the rights of would be educated Indian immigrants in return for some questionable advantages given to Indians already in the Colony.

('8', 397, 1, 3, 942573) Mr. Gandhi therefore did not approve of the Bill and all further correspondence towards a final settlement came to a stop.
('8', 397, 1, 4, 942696) General Smuts said in effect: Since you do not accept this Bill, we will not repeal this Act, but will legalize voluntary registration in the manner we think best. Mr. Gandhi again asked that his application for voluntary registration be returned.
('8', 397, 1, 5, 942944) Mr. Smuts replied that we could fight out the issue in court.
('8', 397, 1, 6, 943006) The Pretoria Indians were immediately informed and a tele gram 1 was sent to arrange a meeting of the Committee [of the British Indian Association] in Johannesburg.
('8', 397, 1, 7, 943171) The meeting was held on Monday afternoon at half past five.
('8', 397, 1, 8, 943231) Those present displayed a magnificent spirit.
('8', 397, 1, 9, 943277) In a do or die mood they resolved to put up a fight.
('8', 397, 1, 10, 943330) It was decided to fight a test case for the withdrawal of an application [for registration].
('8', 397, 1, 11, 943423) A mass meeting was fixed for Wednesday.
('8', 397, 1, 12, 943463) 2 On Tuesday, telegrams were despatched to announce the mass meeting.
('8', 397, 2, 13, 943533) WHITE FRIENDS
('8', 397, 3, 14, 943547) Mr. Hosken, Mr. Cartwright, Mr. Stent and others have promised to help.
('8', 397, 3, 15, 943619) [The Transvaal] Leader has published the report of an interview 3 with Mr. Gandhi.
('8', 397, 3, 16, 943702) He has also addressed letter to the Press, which appears in todays papers.
('8', 397, 3, 17, 943777) It is as under.
('8', 397, 4, 18, 943793) Reuter has cabled the news to England.
('8', 397, 4, 19, 943832) If the community keeps up its present resolve, the law is bound to be repealed and the four points will also be settled to our satisfaction.
('8', 397, 4, 20, 943973) We have a right to both.
('8', 397, 4, 21, 943998) It is a legitimate right.
('8', 397, 4, 22, 944024) Truth always prevails.
('8', 397, 4, 23, 944047) That is the law of this world.
('8', 397, 5, 24, 944078) ASWATS AFFIDAVIT
('8', 397, 6, 25, 944095) A case for the withdrawal of his application will be filed in the Supreme Court on Mr. Aswats behalf.
('8', 397, 6, 26, 944197) If his case and that of Mr. Sorabji are both decided in our favour, the struggle will be over in a short time.
('8', 397, 6, 27, 944308) Even Otherwise Even if these two cases are not decided in our favour, what difference will it make?
('8', 397, 6, 28, 944408) Losing them will not mean defeat for us.

('8', 398, 1, 2, 944808) real Supreme Court is within us, and the true judge, God above us all.
('8', 398, 1, 3, 944879) If we go on striving with faith, fate will never turn against us.
('8', 398, 1, 4, 944945) Should the two cases be decided against us, no one need be alarmed.
('8', 398, 1, 5, 945013) Everything will be all right as long as our own courage does not run out.
('8', 398, 1, 6, 945087) A satyagraha campaign depends on the satyagrahi, not on others.
('8', 398, 2, 7, 945151) TEST CASE
('8', 398, 3, 8, 945161) General Smuts claims that even the Immigrants[Restriction] Act does not guarantee any rights to educated persons.
('8', 398, 3, 9, 945275) If this is true, we have nothing more to say, neither can we hope ever to obtain these rights.
('8', 398, 3, 10, 945370) Mr. Gandhi suggested that the matter be left to the Supreme Court for a decision, but Mr. Smuts was not agreeable.
('8', 398, 3, 11, 945485) A test case has now become inevitable.
('8', 398, 3, 12, 945524) Mr. Sorabji Shapurji, who has passed several Bombay examinations in English and who lives in Charlestown, has agreed to be the defendant in a test case.
('8', 398, 3, 13, 945677) He will attempt to enter Vol ksrust on Wednesday.
('8', 398, 3, 14, 945727) Mr. Chamney has also been informed telegra phically so that he can stop him if he wishes to.
('8', 398, 3, 15, 945820) By the time this appe ars in print, the matter will perhaps have been decided in a magis trates court.
('8', 398, 3, 16, 945923) Wednesday [June 24, 1908] Mr. Sorabji entered the Transvaal on Wednesday.
('8', 398, 3, 17, 945997) Contrary to expectations, he was not stopped at the border, and he has arrived in Johannesburg.
('8', 398, 3, 18, 946093) His movements are, however, being watched by the police.
('8', 398, 3, 19, 946150) This [surveillance] is likely to continue for some time.
('8', 398, 3, 20, 946207) This shows there is some confusion in the Government ranks.
('8', 398, 3, 21, 946267) Its legal advisers are possibly of the view that Mr. Sorabji cannot be touched under the immigration Act.
('8', 398, 3, 22, 946373) Even so, it is likely that he will be arrested soon.
('8', 398, 4, 23, 946426) LAW MAKERS OF THE TRANSVAAL!
('8', 398, 5, 24, 946455) General Smuts has given notice in Parliament [of a motion] to withdraw the Transvaal Municipal [Consolidation] Bill.
('8', 398, 5, 25, 946572) Indian Opin ion readers will recall the strong protest of the Indian community against the Bill.
('8', 398, 5, 26, 946669) 1 The Transvaal Leader has recently published a report that the Government intends to withdraw the Bill relating to the Gold Law.
('8', 398, 5, 27, 946799) [According to the report] it was to be replaced by a shorter Bill, but the Government has denied this.

('8', 399, 2, 3, 947076) JOHANNESBURG June 24, 1908] The receipt of so many telegrams shows the unanimity with which the object of this meeting has been received, but though I have read these telegrams to you, it is due to this meeting, due to the executive of the British Indian Association, and due to the Transvaal public to state also that there is, at this meeting, electric; in the air, and these telegrams by no means demonstrate the whole truth.
('8', 399, 2, 4, 947505) The whole truth is that there is, even in this meeting, a number of Indians who are seething with discontent over what the leaders have done, and over what especially I myself have done, in connection with the compromise.
('8', 399, 2, 5, 947727) There is a number of Indians in this meeting who believe, as the Chairman has stated in his speech, that the whole Indian community has been sold for selfish purposes.
('8', 399, 2, 6, 947895) The Chairman has repudiated the charge, and so do I, but I do not blame my countrymen who bring that charge against me especially.
('8', 399, 3, 7, 948026) Some of my countrymen tell me and, perhaps, with some justi fication that I did not take them into confidence, when I approached General Smuts on the strength of the letter that was placed before me in the gaol yard, and it is better that I myself should voice their complaint I believe that, in seeing General Smuts As I saw him, I acted correctly and in accordance with my conscience, but time has shown that they were right, time has shown also that I need not have gone to General Smuts as I did.
('8', 399, 3, 8, 948527) What I did was simply and solely to accept voluntary registration that was placed before him for over a year by the whole Indian community.
('8', 399, 3, 9, 948667) I felt that I was yielding nothing, not a single new principle, not a single concession, in accepting this volun tary compromise.
('8', 399, 3, 10, 948797) I believed that I had full instructions from my cou ntrymen to do so, but I believed too much.
('8', 399, 3, 11, 948892) I did not know what was to
('8', 399, 4, 12, 948919) 1 The meeting, which was held under the auspices of the British Indian Association at 3.45 p m.
('8', 399, 4, 13, 949015) to discuss the situation arising out of the breach, by the Transvaal Government, of the spirit of the compromise of January 30, 1908, was attended by delegates from all over the Transvaal.
('8', 399, 4, 14, 949204) For resolutions passed at the meeting, vide Appendix V. 2 The Chairman had said: They who assaulted the Chairman and the Secretary distrusted the Government.
('8', 399, 4, 15, 949362) In their opinion, we had misled them, and, when the proper time came, we had sold the community to the Government.
('8', 399, 4, 16, 949477) Whilst I emphatically repudiate any such suggestion, it is impossible for me to deny that the Government have, by their recent conduct, lent colour to the suspicion and distrust.
('8', 400, 0, 1, 949656) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 401
('8', 400, 1, 2, 949701) come after.
('8', 400, 1, 3, 949713) I did not know that there was to be repudiation of the emphatic promise that was made in connection with the repeal of the Act.
('8', 400, 1, 4, 949841) I know now that the compromise is not to be respected by the Government.
('8', 400, 1, 5, 949914) General Smuts says that he never made any promise of repeal but there are documents, which the world will see, which will show, at least that there was a talk and a conversation with reference to the repeal of the Act.
('8', 400, 1, 6, 950133) There are witnesses also in connection with it but as the Chairman has rightly said, that is left for the lawyers to decide.
('8', 400, 1, 7, 950258) 1 The Indian community only knows that the repeal of the Act was the object, and that was the object which was to be gained by undergoing voluntary registration, but today the Indian community finds that voluntary registration has not sufficed [for] the purpose.
('8', 400, 1, 8, 950521) It finds also that it has become necessary to hold this Mass Meeting again, and it has become necessary again, perchance, if it is the will of God, to undergo the same measure of suffering, only far more bitterly.
('8', 400, 1, 9, 950735) If, therefore, you find there is electricity in the air, I do plead guilty.
('8', 400, 1, 10, 950811) I am responsible for it responsible because I had too great faith in the statesmanship of General Smuts, in his honesty, and in his integrity.
('8', 400, 1, 11, 950954) If Any countrymen today believe that I have sold them, they have good reason to believe so, although [there is] no justification for it, in my own estimation.
('8', 400, 1, 12, 951113) They can only judge me by the results obtained.
('8', 400, 1, 13, 951161) They cannot judge, the world is not today so constituted that it will judge men by the motives they ascribe to themselves, but by the result of their actions; and they judge me by the result of my action, the result of having foisted the compromise on the whole of the Indian community, and I include also the Chinese community, because although there were two other gentlemen who signed the letter that was addressed to General Smuts they did so fully believing in my own good faithfully believing that what I was doing was what they were all working for, namely, the repeal of the Act not only in word but in deed, not indeed, to secure a revised edition of the Act, but to obliterate the Act and all its consequences, if the Indian com munity and the Chinese community voluntarily proved that they were capable of being trusted without any legal restraint.
('8', 400, 1, 14, 952021) If they proved that the large majority of the Asiatics had entered the Transvaal with
('8', 400, 2, 15, 952107) 1 The Chairman again: We went to prison to buy liberty of conscience and freedom from molestation and restraint, and we did not come out of the prison gates in order to submit to a law, or a revised edition of it, which was calculated to take away those priceless possessions.
('8', 400, 2, 16, 952384) We want to no bandying of legal phrases and subtleties of lawyers.
('8', 400, 2, 17, 952451) We, as common sense men, want our honour to be respected, and it is for that this great meeting has come to plead.
('8', 401, 0, 1, 952566) 402 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 401, 1, 2, 952608) perfect right, and if they proved that the documents that they held were correct documents and were properlyobtained by them, and were not fraudulent documents, then they undoubtedly believed that the Act would be repealed, that their position was to be much better than it would have been under the Asiatic Act.
('8', 401, 1, 3, 952921) They believed also that they had fought for 16 months, not merely to secure a nominal repeal of the Act, but to secure recognition for themselves as human beings, to secure a voice in the management of their own affairs, to secure a voice in the legislation that may be passed so far as they are con cerned; not a voting paper by any means a voting paper for the Ind ians or the Asiatics may not be worth the paper on which the signature might be put but they wanted a real voting paper, they wanted to be consulted before any legislation was passed.
('8', 401, 1, 4, 953472) And what did they find?
('8', 401, 1, 5, 953496) They found that there was a Gold Law, they found that there was a Municipal kill, both these Bills still further curtailing the rights of those having a right to remain in this country.
('8', 401, 1, 6, 953682) Have they not every reason to believe that Gandhi has misled them?
('8', 401, 1, 7, 953749) Have they not every reason to believe that they have no longer any business to suffer because Gandhi advises them to suffer?
('8', 401, 1, 8, 953874) I see before me a warrior, a military man, who was my fellow prisoner.
('8', 401, 1, 9, 953945) He tells me How shall I trust you?
('8', 401, 1, 10, 953980) You have misled your countrymen, you have given 18 finger impressions.
('8', 401, 1, 11, 954051) I have not.
('8', 401, 1, 12, 954063) I hold my medals, and that is my registration. Another of his fellow religionists, or A fellow Pathan, has assaulted me.
('8', 401, 1, 13, 954184) He deserves every thanks for having assaulted me, because he believed that I was selling the community.
('8', 401, 1, 14, 954288) He had no grudge against me, he was my client.
('8', 401, 1, 15, 954335) He had a perfect right to do what he did, as I find now from the consequences that have been entailed on the whole of the Asiatic communities.
('8', 401, 1, 16, 954478) Gentlemen, those who are here and whose influence reaches far beyond the four corners of this building, go away from this meeting knowing full well what the consequence of General Smuts act will be General Smutsact undertaken in the name of the white communities.
('8', 401, 1, 17, 954742) I may understand, I may distinguish, but, just as my fellow country men could not distinguish and they only had the remedy of assaulting me, another had the remedy of telling me that I had sold my country men; similarly it is not possible for them to distinguish between one white mans word and another white mans word, especially when that word happens to be the word of almost the highest man in the State.
('8', 401, 1, 18, 955151) I state most emphatically and definitely that General Smuts did promise that he was going, to repeal the Act, in the presence of the Registrar of Asiatics, if the Asiatic communities abided fully, frankly,
('8', 402, 0, 1, 955357) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 403
('8', 402, 1, 2, 955402) and freely by the terms of the compromise, if the Asiatic communities enabled General Smuts to identify every Asiatic in the country, and if the Asiatic communities enabled General Smuts to see to it that there wasno Asiatic who could surreptitiously enter into the country and not be found out by his Police.
('8', 402, 1, 3, 955712) These terms the Asiatic communities have fulfilled, and yet we find today, we meet this afternoon to find out, that this Act is not to be repealed as it should be repealed, and that the promise of repeal is hedged in on all sides by such restrictions as could never be accepted by any self respecting man.
('8', 402, 1, 4, 956018) The passive resistance movement has been undertaken only to gain rights for the whole of the Asiatics who have a right to remain in this country and not for a chosen few, and ifthere is one man, whom I can recall, who is in Ladysmith, who came to the country in 1885 and paid 25 to the Boer Government for remaining in this country, carried on a trade, and possesses European credentialsif he cannot enter this country, I, for one, do not wish to remain in this country, if my countrymen before that time do not remove this head which seems to have done grievous wrong to them.
('8', 402, 2, 5, 956596) Indian Opinion, 4 7 1908
('8', 402, 3, 6, 956621) 225. REVIVAL OF PASSIVE RESISTANCE
('8', 402, 4, 7, 956656) It is a thousand pities that General Smuts has, while yielding on the question of the repeal of the Asiatic Act, taken up an obstinate no position on mere matters of detail and of no significance from a Colonial standpoint.
('8', 402, 4, 8, 956880) General Smuts attitude savours very much of straining at a gnat and swallowing a camel.
('8', 402, 4, 9, 956968) He has taken all the grace away from his offer to repeal the Act by robbing it of all advantage to the Asiatics of the Transvaal, and it is hardly to be wondered at that British Indians have summarily rejected an offer which, in effect, places them, as a body, in a worse position than they occupied before the struggle.
('8', 402, 4, 10, 957289) It is true that the bait was held out by the General in the shape of easing the position of those who were included by him in the repealing Bill.
('8', 402, 4, 11, 957435) To the credit of the communities, let it be said that they have not taken the bait.
('8', 402, 4, 12, 957519) As passive resisters, they could not, in order to gain a position for themselves, barter away the rights of others who were just as much entitled to remain in or enter the Transvaal as they themselves.
('8', 402, 4, 13, 957721) The proceedings of the Mass Meeting show unmistakbly that Indians are just as much determined as ever to see the fight to the
('8', 403, 0, 1, 957847) 404 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 403, 1, 2, 957889) finish, and this time they will command far greater sympathy and help, and, if General Smuts has the slightest regard for the Empire to which he belongs, he will still, while there is yet time, refrain from unnecessarily wounding Indian feeling.
('8', 403, 1, 3, 958135) Indian Opinion, 27 6 1908
('8', 403, 2, 4, 958161) 226. SATYAGRAHA AGAIN
('8', 403, 3, 5, 958183) General Smuts has offered to repeal the [Asiatic Registration] Act, but on certain conditions [which are unacceptable].
('8', 403, 3, 6, 958303) That a further battle remained to be fought in the Indian war in the Transvaal has now become clear.
('8', 403, 3, 7, 958404) In every great war, more than one battle has to be fought.
('8', 403, 3, 8, 958463) The Russo Japanese war lasted for over a year.
('8', 403, 3, 9, 958510) In the course of that war, four or five well known battles were fought, at Port Arthur, Mukden, etc.
('8', 403, 3, 10, 958611) The Boer War also lasted for two or three years and came to an end only after several battles had been fought.
('8', 403, 3, 11, 958722) The war of the Transvaal Indians is not an armed conflict as these were.
('8', 403, 3, 12, 958795) Save for that, this, too, is a war.
('8', 403, 3, 13, 958831) For, if we think of the consequences, this war [waged] through satyagraha is no whit less of a war than those fought with [gun and] powder.
('8', 403, 3, 14, 958971) Victory or defeat in this war will have Far reaching consequences for Indians in other Colonies.
('8', 403, 3, 15, 959068) No otherconsequence can be more important than this.
('8', 403, 3, 16, 959121) 1 Looking at it thus, we can unhesitatingly compare this fight by a handful of Indians in the Transvaal to the great campaigns mentioned above.
('8', 403, 3, 17, 959265) A number of battles may be won in the course of a war, but all the gains are wiped out if the final battle is lost.
('8', 403, 3, 18, 959381) The same is true of the Transvaal Indians satyagraha.
('8', 403, 3, 19, 959435) The first battle was fought in 1906. 2 It was waged in the arena of British politics, and the Deputation returned victorious.
('8', 403, 3, 20, 959561) This was followed by a series of encounters in which the Indian community showed fine mettle it earned for itself a name as a brave community which, though a mere handful, compelled the Boers to yield by sheer dint of courage and truth.
('8', 403, 3, 21, 959798) As it happened, however, a large number of Indians were dissatisfied with the settle ment, which means that in their dew, the fight had not been carried far
('8', 403, 4, 22, 959955) 1 No other consequence of satyagraha, such as loss of property or personal inconvenience suffered by satyagrahis, can be more important than that which bears on the conditions of Indians everywhere.
('8', 403, 4, 23, 960154) 2 The reference is to the Transvaal Indian Deputation that visited England.

('8', 404, 1, 2, 960289) enough.
('8', 404, 1, 3, 960297) General Smuts has now provided the opportunity to complete what was prematurely abandoned.
('8', 404, 1, 4, 960388) We believe therefore that satyagra his Indians, instead of feeling unhappy at the resumption of the camp aign, will shout back an eager response to the [war] cry.
('8', 404, 1, 5, 960551) Those who were angry with the leaders for having prematurely called off the campaign have now an opportunity to prove their sincerity.
('8', 404, 1, 6, 960686) They must make common cause with the others and boldly declare that they are ready to lay down their lives for the sake of the honour and rights of Indians.
('8', 404, 1, 7, 960843) If the Indian community evinces this spirit forthe last timefor the present at any ratewe have no doubt that we will win a resounding victory.
('8', 404, 1, 8, 960986) This is the last battle in this war we have been talking of, and it must be won.
('8', 404, 1, 9, 961067) The condition of South African Indians will depend a great deal on the issue of this battle.
('8', 404, 1, 10, 961160) On the one hand, the clouds are louring upon Natal.
('8', 404, 1, 11, 961212) 1 the other, a law regarding registration has already been passed in Rhodesia.
('8', 404, 1, 12, 961291) 2 A Member of Parliament in that Colony pointed out in passing that the Transvaal law had not yet been repealed.
('8', 404, 1, 13, 961404) The Transvaal Indians should take a cue from this and carry the dead law to the crematorium and dispose of it properly.
('8', 404, 1, 14, 961524) They must gird up their loinsfor their own sake and for the sake of all South African Indians.
('8', 404, 1, 15, 961619) Indeed, it appears from a report of the mass meeting that they are thus prepared.
('8', 404, 1, 16, 961701) We congratulate them on this, and urge them to mount a vigorous attack and, for once, let the enemy have a taste of their strength.
('8', 404, 1, 17, 961833) The sword of satyagraha is far superior to the steel sword.
('8', 404, 1, 18, 961893) Truth and justice provide its point; divine help is the hilt that adorns it.
('8', 404, 1, 19, 961970) One who has the use of this sword has no cause to fear defeat.
('8', 404, 1, 20, 962033) Therefore, brave Indians, arise, and without ado, draw the sword of satyagraha and fight unto victory!
('8', 404, 1, 21, 962136) When Japans brave heroes forced the Russians to bite the dust of the battle field, the sun rose in the east.
('8', 404, 1, 22, 962245) And it now shines on all the nations of Asia.
('8', 404, 1, 23, 962291) The people of the East will never, never again submit to insult from the insolent whites.

('8', 405, 2, 3, 962558) VEINS OF WEALTH
('8', 405, 3, 4, 962574) We saw that the value of money consists in its power to command the labour of men.
('8', 405, 3, 5, 962657) If that labour could be had without payment, there should be no further need of money.
('8', 405, 3, 6, 962744) Instances are known where human labour can be had without payment.
('8', 405, 3, 7, 962811) We have considered examples which show that moral power is more effective than the power of money.
('8', 405, 3, 8, 962910) We also saw that mans goodness can do what money cannot do.
('8', 405, 3, 9, 962970) There exist men in many parts of England who cannot be beguiled with money.
('8', 405, 3, 10, 963046) Moreover, if we admit that wealth carries with it the power to direct labour, we shall also see that the more intelligent and moral men are, the greater is the wealth amassed.
('8', 405, 3, 11, 963222) It may even appear on a fullerconsideration that the persons themselves constitute the wealth, not gold and silver.
('8', 405, 3, 12, 963338) We must search for wealth not in the bowels of the earth, but in the hearts of men.
('8', 405, 3, 13, 963422) If this is correct, the true law of economics is that men must be maintained in the best possible health, both of body and mind, and in the highest state of honour.
('8', 405, 3, 14, 963587) A time may also come when England, instead of adorning the turbans of its slaves with diamonds from Golkonda and thus sporting her wealth, may be able to point to her great men of virtue, saying, in the words of a truly eminent Greek, This is my wealth.
('8', 405, 4, 15, 963841) EVEN HANDED JUSTICE 1
('8', 405, 5, 16, 963863) Some centuries before Christ there lived a Jewish merchant, Solomon 2 name.
('8', 405, 5, 17, 963939) He had made a large fortune and earned great fame.
('8', 405, 5, 18, 963990) His maxims are remembered in Europe even today.
('8', 405, 5, 19, 964038) He was so beloved of the Venetians that they erected a statue in the city to his memory.
('8', 405, 5, 20, 964127) Though his maxims are known by rote, very few persons actually practise them.
('8', 405, 5, 21, 964205) He says: Those who make money through lies are afflicted with pride, and that is a sign of their death. At another place, he adds: Treasures of wickedness profit nothing.
('8', 405, 5, 22, 964376) It is truth which delivers from death. 3 In both these maxims Solomon asserts that death is the outcome of wealth unjustly acquired.
('8', 405, 5, 23, 964509) Nowadays,
('8', 405, 6, 24, 964519) 1 This corresponds to Ruskins chapter Qui Judicatis Terram.

('8', 406, 1, 2, 964821) people tell lies or perpetrate injustice so cleverly that we cannot find them out.
('8', 406, 1, 3, 964904) For there are misleading advertisements.
('8', 406, 1, 4, 964945) Things bear attractive labels, and so on.
('8', 406, 1, 5, 964987) Again the wise man says: He that oppresseth the poor to multiply his riches shall surely come to want. And he adds: Rob not the poor because he is poor.
('8', 406, 1, 6, 965140) Oppress not the afflicted in the place of business.
('8', 406, 1, 7, 965192) For God 1 will corrupt the soul of those that torment them. At present, however, it is the practice in business to administer kicks to those who are already dead.
('8', 406, 1, 8, 965355) We are eager to take advantage of a needy man.
('8', 406, 1, 9, 965402) The highwayman robs the rich, but the trader robs the poor.
('8', 406, 1, 10, 965462) Solomon says further: The rich and the poor are equal.
('8', 406, 1, 11, 965517) God is their maker.
('8', 406, 1, 12, 965537) God gives them knowledge. 2 The rich and the poor cannot live, the one without the other.
('8', 406, 1, 13, 965627) They always need each other.Neither of them can be regarded as superior or inferior to the other.
('8', 406, 1, 14, 965725) But evil consequences follow when the two forget that they are equal, and that God is their light.

('8', 406, 4, 20, 966112) The speech was delivered in the Jijinia Theatre on October 22, 1907. It is said that more than 6,000 people heard this address.

('8', 407, 3, 4, 966787) It will take a few days more for complete recovery.
('8', 407, 3, 5, 966839) You get plenty of exercise and open air there, so I need not suggest these to you.
('8', 407, 3, 6, 966922) Do mix freely with Mrs. and Miss Pywell.
('8', 407, 3, 7, 966963) Please let me know your reactions to them.
('8', 407, 3, 8, 967006) The Government have raised an objection about the cremation ground.
('8', 407, 3, 9, 967074) I consider this very derogatory to the Hindus.
('8', 407, 3, 10, 967121) You may spread this [information] and discuss it all round.
('8', 407, 3, 11, 967181) We can put up a good fight over this issue.
('8', 407, 3, 12, 967225) Many whites, too, are likely to help.
('8', 407, 3, 13, 967263) See Motilal 3 find out all the details from him.
('8', 407, 3, 14, 967312) Do not worry about matters at this end.
('8', 407, 3, 15, 967352) In all probability a settlement will be reached without a tussle.

('8', 409, 3, 4, 970158) DEAR MR. PAUL, I have been, indeed, too busy to write to you in reply to your letter.
('8', 409, 3, 5, 970244) I do not think Mr. Rustomjee need be troubled at present, because I have collected just enough to pay Josephs passage 1, and I have authorized Mr. Ritch to pay that amount to him that is to say, I have, 20. If the few pounds that are already collected by Brian Gabriel 2 and Lawrence 3 can be sent him, he will not want anything more.
('8', 409, 3, 6, 970579) If you could collect a little more, it would ease him a bit, and that is all.
('8', 409, 3, 7, 970657) I am glad my ward 4 not forgotten me entirely.
('8', 409, 3, 8, 970704) I am glad, too, that she is making such splendid progress in music.
('8', 409, 3, 9, 970772) I have her, as also your, promise that she is to use her talents for the benefit of Phoenix and, through Phoenix, I take it, of the whole community.
('8', 409, 3, 10, 970921) It is, therefore, in my opinion, a good asset.
('8', 409, 3, 11, 970968) I hope you are all keeping in good health.
('8', 409, 3, 12, 971011) The struggle here may be prolonged, or it may end in a few days.
('8', 409, 3, 13, 971076) The result can only be one, if the people remain firm.

('8', 410, 2, 3, 971557) SATYAGRAHA IN FULL BLOOM
('8', 410, 3, 4, 971582) The satyagraha campaign has been revived.
('8', 410, 3, 5, 971624) Indians have evinced a spirit of sterling worth and everyone appears to be full of courage.
('8', 410, 4, 6, 971716) WHAT CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT
('8', 410, 5, 7, 971739) It necessary to understand this well.
('8', 410, 5, 8, 971777) The fight, then, is not for the repeal of the Act, for General Smuts was quite prepared to do that.
('8', 410, 5, 9, 971877) The Act is bound to be repealed.
('8', 410, 5, 10, 971910) It is in any case as good as repealed for those who do not intend to submit to it.
('8', 410, 5, 11, 971993) Neither is it a fight against [the giving of]finger impressions.
('8', 410, 5, 12, 972058) They are not of the least importance.
('8', 410, 5, 13, 972096) They will not be insisted upon in Rhodesia, 2 but it will be none the less disgraceful for that.
('8', 410, 5, 14, 972193) When it is a matter of preserving self respect and resisting the imposition of slavery, why should there be so much fuss about finger impressions?
('8', 410, 5, 15, 972340) The fight is for [the rights of] those who hold the 3 Dutch registration certificates, for those who are outside the Transvaal at present, but are in a position to prove that they are old residents of the Transvaal.
('8', 410, 5, 16, 972556) It is also for the sake of the educated Indians.
('8', 410, 5, 17, 972605) Every Indian must be clear about this.
('8', 410, 5, 18, 972644) At the time of compromise, this issue could not have been settled.
('8', 410, 5, 19, 972711) The important thing then was to prove the bona fides of the Indian community.
('8', 410, 5, 20, 972789) Till that was done, it was impossible for us to protest.
('8', 410, 5, 21, 972846) No decision could then be taken about those holding the 3 [registration certificates], about the other refugees and about the educated [Asiatic immigrants].
('8', 410, 5, 22, 973003) It was not possible therefore to have the matter settled.
('8', 410, 5, 23, 973061) Now that, while repealing the [Asiatic Registration] Act, General Smuts wants to define the position to their disadvantage and to exclude them, the Indians can insist upon their own view of the matter.
('8', 410, 5, 24, 973263) One should not blame all this on the compromise.
('8', 410, 5, 25, 973312) It is because of the compromise, because of the demonstration of its strength
('8', 410, 6, 26, 973390) 1 This news letter was drafted before the Supreme Court had pronounced on Aswata affidavit asking for the return of his application form for voluntary registration.

('8', 411, 0, 1, 973619) 412 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 411, 1, 2, 973661) by the Indian community that we have got thus far.
('8', 411, 3, 3, 973712) There is only one remedy.
('8', 411, 3, 4, 973738) And that lies in our hands.
('8', 411, 3, 5, 973766) We should ignore the Governments law and act as follows: (1) When necessary, we should burn the certificates of volun tary registration.
('8', 411, 3, 6, 973903) (2) We must refuse to affix our finger impressions or signa tures [on any documents] or to give our names when asked for these by the police.
('8', 411, 3, 7, 974045) (3) We should tender the licence fee, but if the licence is refu sed, should carry on trade without one.
('8', 411, 3, 8, 974150) If, as a consequence of any of these actions, we have to suffer imprisonment, we must accept it.
('8', 411, 3, 9, 974247) If we do that the day of our freedom will be hastened.
('8', 411, 3, 10, 974302) Even otherwise, people have so far fought, if only for their own rights.
('8', 411, 3, 11, 974375) Henceforth, those who have received certificates of voluntary registration will fight especially for the sake of the others referred to above.
('8', 411, 3, 12, 974518) And if we refuse to fight, we cannot claim that ours is true satyagraha.
('8', 411, 3, 13, 974591) It is not as if the sword of satyagraha can be used only once and becomes useless afterwards.
('8', 411, 3, 14, 974685) If we have discovered its real worth, we can use it each time we have to fight.
('8', 411, 3, 15, 974765) It is more effective than a sword of steel.
('8', 411, 3, 16, 974809) All that is required is the capacity to endure suffering.
('8', 411, 3, 17, 974867) We should not fight shy of imprisonment.
('8', 411, 3, 18, 974908) We must not imagine that eating mealie pap will do us any harm.
('8', 411, 4, 19, 974972) HOW THEN CAN WE LEAVE COLONY?
('8', 411, 5, 20, 975002) This question has been raked by a number of persons.
('8', 411, 5, 21, 975055) If people burn their certificates, what authority will they have for returning to the Transvaal after leaving the Colony once?
('8', 411, 5, 22, 975182) That the question has at all been asked suggest an inadequacy in our concept of satyagraha.
('8', 411, 5, 23, 975274) My reply is : a resident of the Transvaal would only need authority if it was necessary for him to have any authority for going to India.
('8', 411, 5, 24, 975412) Indian residents of the Transvaal should undoubtedly enter [the Colony] even if they are without registers.
('8', 411, 5, 25, 975520) The only risk in doing so is that one may be put in gaol.
('8', 411, 5, 26, 975578) Let them imprison [us].
('8', 411, 5, 27, 975602) But bail [money] must not be paid.
('8', 411, 5, 28, 975637) We do not want to be let out on bail.
('8', 411, 5, 29, 975675) The fine must not be paid either.
('8', 411, 5, 30, 975709) Even defence which would make a lawyer neces sary must not be offered.
('8', 411, 5, 31, 975780) Whatever defence is needed will be provided by Mr. Gandhi, free of charge as usual, the only condition being that the person concerned should be a true satyagrahi, that he should have
('8', 412, 0, 1, 975964) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 413
('8', 412, 1, 2, 976009) a valid case, and that the case should promote the communitys interests.

('8', 412, 3, 4, 976096) Those who wish to adopt this course are not in any wise with the case in the Supreme Court It will be well and good it as a result of it, application forms [for voluntary registration] are returned.
('8', 412, 3, 5, 976295) The end will come sooner in that case.
('8', 412, 3, 6, 976334) But if the forms are not returned, that should not matter.
('8', 412, 3, 7, 976393) What is necessary is that we ourselves should remain strong.
('8', 412, 3, 8, 976454) If the forms are returned, that would have the effect of instantaneously invalidating the registers.
('8', 412, 3, 9, 976555) Burning them also comes to the same thing.
('8', 412, 3, 10, 976598) One should not assume that the registers will remain valid even after the forms have been returned.
('8', 412, 3, 11, 976698) Registers without applications are like revolvers without cartridges.
('8', 412, 3, 12, 976768) The only object of asking for the return of application forms is to ensure that the registers are invalidated immediately.
('8', 412, 3, 13, 976891) Burning them will not quite render them invalid for there are copies with the Government and the applications contain all the particulars.
('8', 412, 3, 14, 977030) What we are afraid of is that, even if we do burn the registers, the Government may not prosecute us.
('8', 412, 3, 15, 977132) We want to go to gaol.
('8', 412, 3, 16, 977155) The Government does not want to send us to gaol.
('8', 412, 3, 17, 977204) The best way, therefore, to arrive in gaol is to get our applications back.
('8', 412, 3, 18, 977280) Mr. Smuts has said that the Government itself wants to act like a passive resister.
('8', 412, 3, 19, 977364) I shall not admit this to be satyagraha, for that will be mere unreasonable obstinacy on its part.
('8', 412, 3, 20, 977463) By refusing to return our applications, the Government wants to avoid being obliged to send us to gaol.
('8', 412, 3, 21, 977567) Its motives in doing so are unworthy.
('8', 412, 3, 22, 977605) It is afraid of the 7,000 voluntary registrants, who are full of courage.
('8', 412, 3, 23, 977679) They are capable of fighting it out.
('8', 412, 3, 24, 977716) The Government does not wish to do anything which may provoke them.
('8', 412, 3, 25, 977784) All this is easy to understand.
('8', 412, 3, 26, 977816) Let everyone think it over and then ask himself whether it would have been possible to put up such a fight three months ago.
('8', 412, 3, 27, 977941) Was the Government afraid of us then?
('8', 412, 3, 28, 977979) Is there any doubt that if we fight we shall win?
('8', 412, 4, 29, 978029) FAKE REGISTERS
('8', 412, 5, 30, 978044) The communitys enemies persist in their mischievous activities.
('8', 412, 5, 31, 978108) There is a barber named Jaymal who has been arrested for selling faked permits.
('8', 412, 5, 32, 978188) He is said to have sold a faked permit to a Khoja 1, whopaid 20 for it.
('8', 412, 5, 33, 978260) The Khoja fell into the hands of Mr. Ali Khamisa

('8', 413, 1, 3, 978413) The Khoja has now become a Crown witness.
('8', 413, 1, 4, 978455) (Anyone who, acting as a special witness, supplies information to the Government and helps discover the truth is known as the Kings witness or a Crown witness.) The information supplied by him has led to the arrest of Jaymal.
('8', 413, 1, 5, 978681) If this information which I have received is correct, I congratulate Mr. Ali Khamisa.
('8', 413, 1, 6, 978767) He has rendered the com munity a service.
('8', 413, 1, 7, 978809) Indians like Jaymal are enemies of the community.
('8', 413, 1, 8, 978859) One should see to it that they are punished.
('8', 413, 1, 9, 978904) The community has sufferedon their account, and will Yet suffer.
('8', 413, 1, 10, 978969) They will continue so to do harm.
('8', 413, 1, 11, 979003) Those who buy faked permits only walk into 3 trap.
('8', 413, 1, 12, 979054) It instead of resorting to such questionable methods, they were to adhere to the path of satyagraha, that would sooner or later enable every Indian with a rightful claim, every bona fide refugeethat is, a refugee who was resident in the Transvaal for some length of time to enter.
('8', 413, 1, 13, 979335) Intending immigrants who are altogether new to the place should not even entertain any thought of coming in.
('8', 413, 2, 14, 979444) GENERAL SMUTS AFFIDAVIT
('8', 413, 3, 15, 979468) General Smuts and Mr. Chamney have submitted affidavits to say that the former never made the promise to repeal the Act.
('8', 413, 3, 16, 979589) The affidavits were submitted on the day on which the case came up for hearing.
('8', 413, 3, 17, 979669) The affidavit were not submitted on the first day, which is enough to show that they are not telling the truth.
('8', 413, 3, 18, 979781) Most of the documents bearing on this matter have been published in the English [section].
('8', 413, 3, 19, 979872) In Gujarati [we will publish them] the next time.
('8', 413, 3, 20, 979922) At the moment, a number of interesting developments are taking place.
('8', 413, 4, 21, 979992) SORABJIS CASE
('8', 413, 5, 22, 980006) They have not laid hands on Mr. Sorabji yet Mr. Vernon often comes to see him.
('8', 413, 5, 23, 980085) He was asked to report himself at the police station, and this he has flatly refused to do.
('8', 413, 5, 24, 980177) Mr. Sorabji is prepared for imprisonment, but will not leave the Transvaal of submit to the obnoxious Act.
('8', 413, 5, 25, 980284) His case will greatly help the Indian community.
('8', 413, 5, 26, 980333) He is eagerly waiting for the Government to arrest him.
('8', 413, 6, 27, 980389) HAWKERS
('8', 413, 7, 28, 980397) [A number of] Indian hawkers ask [us] how they are to carry on without licences.
('8', 413, 7, 29, 980478) They have their permits with them, but not the certificates of voluntary registration, for they entered the Colony after the dispute with the Government had started.
('8', 413, 7, 30, 980644) They do not want to take out registration certificates which are compulsory under the Asiatic Registration Act.
('8', 413, 7, 31, 980756) Two such Indians, Mr. Ismail Amod and Mr. Ibrahim Marolia, have started trading without licences.

('8', 414, 1, 3, 981028) they are prepared to go to gaol.
('8', 414, 1, 4, 981061) If they are arrested, they will be defended by Mr. Gandhi.
('8', 414, 1, 5, 981120) We hope that other hawkers will have the same courage to carry on the fight.
('8', 414, 1, 6, 981197) No one need discontinue his business altogether.
('8', 414, 2, 7, 981246) ESSOP MIAS LETTER
('8', 414, 3, 8, 981264) Mr. Essop Mia has addressed letters to the Government and the Municipality saying that these Indians are not prepared to starve, andthat they must continue business.
('8', 414, 3, 9, 981430) They will therefore trade without licences, since the Municipality has refused to issue them these.
('8', 414, 3, 10, 981530) They are still prepared to take them out if the Government agrees to issue them.
('8', 414, 3, 11, 981611) The campaign for burning certificates of voluntary registration is gathering way.
('8', 414, 3, 12, 981693) For one thing, there is the agitation [by way of mass meetings, etc.].
('8', 414, 3, 13, 981764) For another, hawkers and others are trading without licences.
('8', 414, 3, 14, 981826) Thirdly, there is Mr. Sorabjis case.
('8', 414, 3, 15, 981863) Let us see now if General Smuts can find any way out of this [situation].
('8', 414, 3, 16, 981937) I, for do not believe that he can bear to behold the light of satyagraha.
('8', 414, 3, 17, 982011) Everything depends on the spirit of unity among Indians and their courage.

('8', 414, 5, 19, 982102) The Hamidia Islamic Society sent a telegram to the Cape Conference.

('8', 414, 7, 23, 982409) JOHANNESBURG, July 2, 1908
('8', 414, 8, 24, 982436) SIR The Supreme Court has decided that Asiatics have no right torecall voluntary registration applications.
('8', 414, 8, 25, 982544) 1 The object of going to Court was for voluntar[il]y registered Asiatics to place themselves on the same footing as their unregistered brethren who, they contend, have a right to be placed on a par with them but who, General Smuts contends, ought to be banished out of the country or, being absent, should not be allowed to return to the country of their domicile.
('8', 414, 9, 26, 982909) 1 For details of the judgment, vide Johannesburg Letter, 7 7 1908
('8', 415, 0, 1, 982975) 416 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 415, 1, 2, 983017) The questionable victory gained by General Smuts on a highly technical point of law will not thwart the purpose of the Asiatics to become disregistered, provided that they have sufficient courage and spirit of self sacrifice.
('8', 415, 1, 3, 983243) The application to the Supreme Court had to have a legal as also a moral basis.
('8', 415, 1, 4, 983323) The legal basis consisted in the ability on either side to treat the compromise as a nullity without getting any relief from theCourt.
('8', 415, 1, 5, 983458) The moral basis consisted in showing that Asiatics wished to treat it as a nullity, because of its breach by General Smuts.
('8', 415, 1, 6, 983582) The breach is twofold.
('8', 415, 1, 7, 983605) General Smuts will not repeal the Act without imposing unacceptable conditions, and he will not take voluntary registration in terms of the compromise from those who are now entering the country and who are entitled to enter it.
('8', 415, 1, 8, 983834) General Smuts denies having promised to repeal the Act, and interprets the compromise to mean that those who entered the country after the lapse of three months after the date of the compromise should register under the Act.
('8', 415, 1, 9, 984059) Let the public judge the meaning of the following:
('8', 415, 2, 10, 984110) Under these circumstances, we would once more respectfully suggest to the Government that all Asiatics over the age of 16 should be allowed within a certain limited period, say three months, to register themselves, and that to all who so register the Act be not applied, and that the Government take whatever steps they deem advisable to legalize such registration.
('8', 415, 2, 11, 984476) Such mode of registration should apply to those also who being out of the Colony may return and otherwise possess the right of re entry.
('8', 415, 3, 12, 984613) General Smuts says that the men who were out of the Colony should have returned within the three months in order to entitle them to come under the compromise.
('8', 415, 3, 13, 984772) I ask whether it was possible ever to inform Asiatics throughout the world of the existence of the compromise, or for them to return within that period.
('8', 415, 3, 14, 984925) As to the promise of repeal, I beg to ask your indulgence for publication of the enclosed correspondence 2 and to leave it to the public to judge whether the repeal was promised or not.
('8', 415, 3, 15, 985111) I would draw attention to the fact that, in answer to my letter of the 22nd February detailing the legislation to repeal and replace the Asiatic Act, there is not one word of repudiation of the promised repeal.
('8', 415, 3, 16, 985322) Of my allusions to the promise in the correspondence that took place after suspicions were roused, there is no repudiation.
('8', 415, 3, 17, 985446) My pointed questions are evaded.
('8', 415, 3, 18, 985479) I add to this the statement that, immediately after the assault committed on me, as a result of my acceptance of the compromise,

('8', 416, 1, 2, 985731) Mr. Chamney saw me at Mr. Dokes house, and he and I drew up a notice for publication in Asiatic languages that, the Asiatics complying with the compromise, the Act would be repealed.
('8', 416, 1, 3, 985914) This notice Mr. Chamney said would be taken to General Smuts and then published.
('8', 416, 1, 4, 985995) He returned the next day or the day after and informed me that Asiatics were registering and inquired whether, in view of that fact, it was necessary to publish the notice.
('8', 416, 1, 5, 986168) I, never dreaming of recantation on General Smuts part, said it need not be published.
('8', 416, 1, 6, 986255) I challenge him to produce the original draft, if it is still in existence.
('8', 416, 1, 7, 986331) I add, further, that Mr. Chamney, not once, but often, told me that General Smuts would keep his promise and repeal the Act and that not much over a month ago, I met him by appointment at Winchester House, where he actually discussed the draft submitted by me, and, in the main, approved of it.
('8', 416, 1, 8, 986626) He has, on oath, denied that General Smuts promised repeal in his presence.
('8', 416, 1, 9, 986702) He may similarly deny the statements I am now making.
('8', 416, 1, 10, 986756) But Truth is superior to General Smuts, him, and me.
('8', 416, 1, 11, 986809) The path before my countrymen is clear.
('8', 416, 1, 12, 986849) They must be prepared again to suffer.
('8', 416, 1, 13, 986888) Through their sufferings the public will see do was right.
('8', 416, 1, 14, 986947) Let me reiterate the points of dispute.
('8', 416, 1, 15, 986987) Though promise of repeal is denied, General Smuts is ready to repeal the Act if we would submit to the rights of domiciled Asiatics, and educated Asiatics who are entitled under the immigrants Restriction Act to enter the country, being taken away.

('8', 416, 4, 18, 987307) It is necessary that every Indian should understand the nature of the campaign in the Transvaal.
('8', 416, 4, 19, 987404) We have earlier explained the meaning of satyagraha through many examples.
('8', 416, 4, 20, 987479) 1 Time has now come to realize that meaning through action.
('8', 416, 4, 21, 987539) Satyagraha and self interest do not go together.
('8', 416, 4, 22, 987588) Satyagraha always calls for sacrifice of self.
('8', 416, 4, 23, 987635) The rights of Indians holding permits have been secured; the Government is prepared to exempt them from the obnoxious Act However, the situation demands that it the permit holders should sacrifice their interests for the sake of those holding the 3 Dutch registration certificates and the educated.
('8', 416, 4, 24, 987934) We rejoice in this opportunity [for

('8', 417, 1, 3, 988170) Satyagraha will reveal its real meaning now.
('8', 417, 1, 4, 988215) The Government is agreeable to repeal of the Act.
('8', 417, 1, 5, 988265) But no action is being taken because the Indian community will not accept the conditions for the repeal.
('8', 417, 1, 6, 988370) This is no mean achievement, for the community is being treated as 3 worthy opponent by the Government.
('8', 417, 1, 7, 988474) It was obliged to consult the community in drafting the Bill.
('8', 417, 1, 8, 988536) It is satyagraha which has brought this about.
('8', 417, 1, 9, 988583) Earlier, there was an element of self interest in the campaign.
('8', 417, 1, 10, 988647) Every Indian who fought in the Transvaal was defending his rights as well asthose of the community.
('8', 417, 1, 11, 988747) The Indians who join the campaign now will be defending the rights of their brethren.
('8', 417, 1, 12, 988833) That is the beauty of it.
('8', 417, 1, 13, 988859) The Indian community will achieve an undying name for itself if it succeeds in this selfless task.
('8', 417, 1, 14, 988958) It will ensure its own happiness and of others, and thus win the admiration of all India.
('8', 417, 1, 15, 989048) We hope, therefore, that the Indian community will remain steadfast.

('8', 417, 3, 18, 989182) A law similar to the one in the Transvaal has been enacted in Rhodesia.
('8', 417, 3, 19, 989254) It remains to be seen whether it will receive [Royal] assent.
('8', 417, 3, 20, 989316) The chances are that it will not.
('8', 417, 3, 21, 989350) The South Africa British Indian Committee has put up a strong fight on the issue.
('8', 417, 3, 22, 989432) This has been the subject, too, of Reuter cables.
('8', 417, 3, 23, 989482) The Rhodesia Indians have acted wisely in submitting a petition.
('8', 417, 3, 24, 989547) Since they are scattered all over [the Colony], they have not been able to do much.
('8', 417, 3, 25, 989631) Bhimji Nayak appears to have taken great pains.
('8', 417, 3, 26, 989679) There is a point as regards the struggle in Rhodesia that is worth nothing.
('8', 417, 3, 27, 989755) When the Chartered Company 2 in England was approached by Reuter, As agent replied that there was no intention to insult the Indians, but that it was necessary to place restrictions on the community.
('8', 417, 3, 28, 989955) The finger print system would not, however, be adopted.
('8', 417, 3, 29, 990011) As if it was only the finger print system to which exception was taken!
('8', 417, 4, 30, 990083) 1Vide also Rhodesia Indians,30 5 1908 2 The British South Africa Company, which received its charter in October 1889, administered Rhodesia till September 1923, when the Colony was formally annexed to the British Crown.

('8', 418, 1, 2, 990405) What does it matter if after imposing slavery on the community in the form of the law, they do or do not ask for finger prints?
('8', 418, 1, 3, 990533) The important thing is that this law should go, instead of which they want to retain the law and add that the finger prints will not be insisted upon.
('8', 418, 1, 4, 990684) We suggest to the reader that he should carefully note from this instance the distinction between the law as such and the [system of] finger impressions.
('8', 418, 1, 5, 990838) We have no hesitation in advising the Rhodesia Indians to give their finger impressions if, by doing so, they can have this legislation withdrawn.
('8', 418, 1, 6, 990985) The law means perpetual slavery.
('8', 418, 1, 7, 991018) The giving of finger prints may be a means of avoiding that enslavement.
('8', 418, 1, 8, 991091) Of course, we do not suggest that they should offer to give their finger impressions right away.
('8', 418, 1, 9, 991188) They should wait for the reply from England.
('8', 418, 1, 10, 991233) But we hope that, if the reply is unfavourable, they will resort to satyagraha and refuse to submit to the law.
('8', 418, 1, 11, 991345) Also, they should send a petition to England.

('8', 418, 3, 14, 991456) Wealth is like a river.
('8', 418, 3, 15, 991480) A river always flows towards the sea, that is, down an incline.
('8', 418, 3, 16, 991544) So, as a general rule must wealth go where it is needed.
('8', 418, 3, 17, 991601) But the flow of wealth, like the course of a river, can be regulated.
('8', 418, 3, 18, 991671) Most of the rivers run out their courses unregulated, their marshy banks poisoning the wind.
('8', 418, 3, 19, 991764) If dams are built across these rivers to direct the water flow as required, they will irrigate the soil and keep the atmosphere pure.
('8', 418, 3, 20, 991898) Similarly the uncontrolled use of wealth will multiply vices among men and cause starvation; in brief, such wealth will act like a poison.
('8', 418, 3, 21, 992037) But the selfsame wealth, if its circulation is regulated and its use controlled, can, like a river whose stream has been properly harnessed, promote prosperity.
('8', 418, 3, 22, 992198) The principle of regulating the circulation of wealth is ignored altogether by economists.
('8', 418, 3, 23, 992289) Theirs is merely the science of getting rich.
('8', 418, 3, 24, 992335) But there are many different ways of getting rich.
('8', 418, 3, 25, 992386) There was a time in Europe when people sought to acquire wealth by poisoning owners of large estates and appropriating their possessions.
('8', 418, 3, 26, 992524) Nowadays, merchants adulterate the food sold to the poor, for example, milk with borax, [wheat] flour with potato flour, coffee with chicory, butter with fat and so on.
('8', 418, 3, 27, 992693) This is on the same level as getting rich by poisoning others.
('8', 418, 3, 28, 992756) Can we call this either an art or a science of getting rich?
('8', 418, 3, 29, 992817) Let us not, however, assume that by getting rich economists merely mean getting rich by robbing others.
('8', 418, 3, 30, 992921) They should point
('8', 419, 0, 1, 992939) 420 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 419, 1, 2, 992981) out that theirs is a science of getting rich by legal or just means.
('8', 419, 1, 3, 993050) It happens these days that many things which are legal are not just.
('8', 419, 1, 4, 993119) The only right way, therefore, to acquire wealth is to do so justly.
('8', 419, 1, 5, 993188) And if this is true, we must know what is just.
('8', 419, 1, 6, 993236) It is not enough to live by the laws of demand and supply.
('8', 419, 1, 7, 993295) Fish, wolves and rats subsist in that manner.
('8', 419, 1, 8, 993341) Bigger fish prey on smaller ones, rats swallow insects and wolves devour even human beings.
('8', 419, 1, 9, 993433) That for them is the law [of Nature]; they know no better.
('8', 419, 1, 10, 993492) But God has endowed man with understanding, with a sense of justice.
('8', 419, 1, 11, 993561) He must follow these and not think of growing rich by devouring othersby cheating others and reducing them to beggary.
('8', 419, 1, 12, 993680) Let us examine what then the laws of justice regarding payment of labour are.
('8', 419, 1, 13, 993758) As we stated earlier, a just wage for a worker will be that which will secure him the same labour, when he needs it, as he has put in forustoday.
('8', 419, 1, 14, 993904) If we give him a lower wage, he will be underpaid, and if more, overpaid.
('8', 419, 1, 15, 993978) [Suppose] a man wants to engage a worker.
('8', 419, 1, 16, 994020) Two persons offer their services.
('8', 419, 1, 17, 994054) If the man who offers to accept a lower wage is engaged, he will be underpaid.
('8', 419, 1, 18, 994133) If there is a large number of employers and only one worker, he will get his own terms and will very likely be overpaid.
('8', 419, 1, 19, 994254) The just wage lies between these two points.
('8', 419, 1, 20, 994299) If someone lends me money which I have to repay after a time, I shall pay him interest.
('8', 419, 1, 21, 994387) Similarly, if someone gives me his labour today, I must return him an identical quantity of labour and something more by way of interest.
('8', 419, 1, 22, 994525) If someone gives me an hour [of labour] today, I should promise to give him an hour and five minutes or more.
('8', 419, 1, 23, 994635) This is true of every kind of worker.
('8', 419, 1, 24, 994673) If, now, of two men who offer me their services, I engage the one who accepts the lower wage, the result will be that he will be half starved while the other man will remain unemployed.
('8', 419, 1, 25, 994859) Even otherwise, if I pay full wages to the workman whom I employ, the other man will be unemployed.
('8', 419, 1, 26, 994959) But the former will not starve, and I shall have made just use of my money.
('8', 419, 1, 27, 995035) Starvation really occurs only when the due wages are not paid.
('8', 419, 1, 28, 995098) If I pay due wages, surplus wealth will not accumulate in my hands.
('8', 419, 1, 29, 995166) I shall not waste money on luxuries and add to the poverty.
('8', 419, 1, 30, 995226) The workman whom I pay justly will in turn learn to pay others justly.
('8', 419, 1, 31, 995297) Thus the stream of justice will not dry up; instead it will gather speed as it flows.
('8', 419, 1, 32, 995383) And the nation which has such a sense of justice will grow happy and prosper in the right direction.
('8', 419, 1, 33, 995484) According to this line of reasoning, economists are found to be wrong.
('8', 419, 1, 34, 995555) They argue that increased competition means growing

('8', 420, 1, 2, 995652) prosperity for a nation.
('8', 420, 1, 3, 995677) This is not true in fact.
('8', 420, 1, 4, 995703) Competition is desired because it reduces the rate of wages.
('8', 420, 1, 5, 995764) The rich become richer thereby and the poor poorer.
('8', 420, 1, 6, 995816) Such competition is likely to ruin a nation in the long run.
('8', 420, 1, 7, 995877) The right law of demand and supply should ensure the payment of a just wage to a workman according to his worth.
('8', 420, 1, 8, 995990) This, too, will mean competition, but the result will be that people will be happy and skilful, for, instead of being obliged to underbid one another, they will have to acquire [new] skills to secure employment.
('8', 420, 1, 9, 996202) It is for this reason that men are drawn to government service.
('8', 420, 1, 10, 996266) There, salaries are fixed according to the gradation of posts.
('8', 420, 1, 11, 996329) The competition is only with regard to ability.
('8', 420, 1, 12, 996377) A candidate does not offer to accept a lower salary but claims that he is abler than others.
('8', 420, 1, 13, 996470) The same is the case with the Army and the Navy, and that is why there is much lesscorruption in these services.
('8', 420, 1, 14, 996583) But only in trade and commerce is there unhealthy competition, as a result of which corrupt practices, such as fraud, chicanery, theft, have increased.
('8', 420, 1, 15, 996735) Furthermore, goods of poor quality are manufactured.
('8', 420, 1, 16, 996788) The manufacturer wants a lions share [of the price] for himself, the workman to throw dust in the eyes of others and the consumer to exploit the situation to his own advantage.
('8', 420, 1, 17, 996965) This poisons all human intercourse, there is starvation all round, strikes multiply, manufacturers become rogues and consumers disregard ethical considerations.
('8', 420, 1, 18, 997126) One injustice leads to numerous others, and in the end the employer, the operative and the customer are all unhappy and meet with ruin.
('8', 420, 1, 19, 997262) A people among whom these [corrupt] practices prevail comes to grief in the end.
('8', 420, 1, 20, 997343) Its very wealth acts like a poison.
('8', 420, 1, 21, 997379) This is why men of wisdom have held that where Mammon is God, no one worships the true God.
('8', 420, 1, 22, 997471) Wealth cannot be reconciled with God.
('8', 420, 1, 23, 997509) God lives only in the homes of the poor.
('8', 420, 1, 24, 997550) This is what the British profess, but in practice they place wealth above everything else, estimate the prosperity of the nation by the number of its rich, and their economists formulate precepts for everyone to get rich quickly.
('8', 420, 1, 25, 997780) True economics is the economics of justice.
('8', 420, 1, 26, 997824) That people alone will be happy which learns how to do justice and be righteous under all conditions of life.
('8', 420, 1, 27, 997934) All else is vain, a kind of moral perversity that presages doom.
('8', 420, 1, 28, 997999) To teach the people to get rich at any cost is to teach them an evil lesson.

('8', 421, 2, 3, 998185) [JOHANNESBURG] [THE EDITOR THE STAR
('8', 421, 3, 4, 998221) SIR,] Mr. Duncans letter with reference to the charge, which, with all deference to him, I must still continue to describe as foul, as to an organized illicit entry of Asiatics enables me to explain the position more fully to the public.
('8', 421, 3, 5, 998459) It is the charge of organized illicit entry that Asiatics have always denied, and which only it was in their power to deny.
('8', 421, 3, 6, 998583) One swallow does not make a summer, nor can isolated cases of unlawful entry be used to condemn a whole community.
('8', 421, 3, 7, 998698) The charge was threefold: (1) that Asiatics entered on permits which were not their bona fide property; (2) that they entered on permits fraudulently obtained; (3) that they entered on forged permits.
('8', 421, 3, 8, 998899) And it A was in order to test whether the documents held by Asiatic communities at the time were so tainted or not that the Bill was brought in.
('8', 421, 3, 9, 999044) With reference to the 9,000 applications, it is admitted in the Governors Speech that almost all the Asiatics in the Colony have tendered voluntary registration.
('8', 421, 3, 10, 999206) 2 I, therefore, assume that, in January last there were 9,000 Asiatics in the Colony.
('8', 421, 3, 11, 999292) They have all tendered their documents, and, on the strength thereof, 7,600 have already been proved to have been legitimate residents of the Transvaal.
('8', 421, 3, 12, 999445) As a matter or fact, the balance of the applications have not yet been rejected.
('8', 421, 3, 13, 999526) On the contrary, most of them will probably be able to establish their bona fides.
('8', 421, 3, 14, 999609) Their claims are still under consideration only because of the deadlock that has ensued, that is to say, they are holders of Dutch registration certificates, which General Smuts has declined to recognize as sufficient tide to residence in the Colony.
('8', 421, 4, 15, 999860) 1 This was published in Indian Opinion under the title Rejoinder to Mr. Duncan.
('8', 421, 4, 16, 999940) 2 In the course of his address to Parliament on June 15, on the occasion of its reopening, the Governor had said, Practically the whole of the Asiatic population of this Colony to the number of 9, 072 have tendered voluntary registration and provisional registration certificates have already been issued to 7,617 Asiatics.
('8', 422, 0, 1, 1000264) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 423
('8', 422, 1, 2, 1000309) I may add that, according to the figures supplied by the Registrar of Asiatics, over 13,000 permits have been issued and are now in circulation.
('8', 422, 1, 3, 1000454) of these, under voluntary registration, 8,500 (assuming 500 are represented by Dutch registration certificates) have been called in and, it out of 8,500, 7,000 have established their tide, will Mr. Duncan allow me to claim that there was no organized illicit entry?
('8', 422, 1, 4, 1000720) With reference to the 4,500 outstanding permits (and they outstanding because those Asiatics are outside the Colony).
('8', 422, 1, 5, 1000838) I make bold to say that it will be found that very few of these permits are tainted.
('8', 422, 1, 6, 1000923) The Indian community has never endeavoured to challenge the statement that there was some illicit immigration of Asiatics.
('8', 422, 1, 7, 1001046) All that was stated in 1906, and I make bold to repeat, is that the evidence adduced was not, and is not now, sufficient to establish the charge of wholesale fraudulent entry.
('8', 422, 1, 8, 1001222) The Peace Preservation Ordinance was enough to deal with isolated cases.
('8', 422, 1, 9, 1001295) The compulsory measure was brought in because of, and was based upon, the assumption that Asiatics would not voluntarily allow their claims to be examined because they were largely tainted with fraud.
('8', 422, 1, 10, 1001496) Hence the offer of voluntary registration and hence also my statement that the result of voluntary registration has disposed of the foul charge of an organized illicit entry of Asiatics.

('8', 422, 4, 13, 1001764) JOHANNESBURG, July 4, 1908 EDITOR INDIAN OPINION
('8', 422, 5, 14, 1001813) SIR, The test case brought against Mr. Sorabji, a Parsi gentleman of culture and English education, who has entered the Colony under the Immigrants Restriction Act, marks another stage in the Asiatic struggle.
('8', 422, 5, 15, 1002023) Mr. Sorabji, who holds splendid testimonials from the Chair man of the Charlestown Local Board and other prominent Europeans, is now to be tried not under the Immigrants Restriction Act but under the Asiatic Law Amendment Act, for being an Asiatic without regis tration under the Act.
('8', 422, 5, 16, 1002308) I say nothing with reference to the trial under
('8', 423, 0, 1, 1002356) 424 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 423, 1, 2, 1002398) the Asiatic Act because it is sub judice: but the Act of the case being brought under the Asiatic Act proves the point I have ventured to raise before General Smuts that educated Asiatics were free to enter under the Immigrants Restriction Act.
('8', 423, 1, 3, 1002643) That they become liable to a removal order if they do not accept Asiatic Act has been known all along, and that was why the petition 1 against the Immigrants Restriction Act stated that what the Government gave with the one hand, they took away with the other.
('8', 423, 1, 4, 1002904) Could Mr. Sorabji bring himself to accept degra dation under the Asiatic Act, he would not be a prohibited immigrant.
('8', 423, 1, 5, 1003022) What General Smuts asks Asiatics to give against repeal of the Asiatic Act is that they should surrender the rights of, say, Sir Mancherji Bhownaggree.
('8', 423, 1, 6, 1003174) It will now be seen clearly that Asiatics are not asking for any thing they are not entitled to by law.
('8', 423, 1, 7, 1003278) The anomalous position before the Colony in view of the arrest of an alleged permit forger at Pretoria today is that those who are rightful residents and who helped the Government can be kept on tenter hooks, whereas those Indians who are dishonest and steal into the country, by forgery or otherwise, may remain in it without molestation, because they would never approach the Government officials for identification, licence, or otherwise.

('8', 423, 4, 10, 1003807) [JOHANNESBURG,] July 6, 1908 THE COLONIAL SECRETARY PRETORIA
('8', 423, 5, 11, 1003868) SIR, A mass meeting 3 over eight hundred British Indians was held yesterday at the Hamidia Mosque to consider the Indian position as it is affected by the Supreme Court decision on the application for the return of the voluntary registration applications.
('8', 423, 5, 12, 1004124) My Association still
('8', 423, 6, 13, 1004145) 1 VidePetition to Secretary of State for Colonies, 23 8 1907 2 This appeared in Indian Opinion the title The Ultimatum and was part of the precis forwarded by the Colonial Office along with his letter of July 22, 1908. 3 At this meeting, Sorabji Shapurji declared his determination not to submit to the registration law.
('8', 423, 6, 14, 1004466) He also claimed as an educated man free right of entry into the Transvaal.
('8', 424, 0, 1, 1004541) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 425
('8', 424, 1, 2, 1004586) respectfully trusts that these forms may be returned.
('8', 424, 1, 3, 1004640) The mass meet ing decided to hold another next Sunday for the purpose of burning voluntary registration certificates, in order that, in the event of the claims of domiciled British Indians and others not being considered by the Government, they may range themselves alongside of suchIndians and suffer with them.
('8', 424, 1, 4, 1004953) My Association is most anxious to avoid such a drastic step and, therefore, once more humbly approaches the Government for assistance.
('8', 424, 1, 5, 1005088) My Association reminds you of the speech delivered by you at Richmond 1 just the compromise, and reported in The Star of the 6th February last.
('8', 424, 1, 6, 1005232) In that speech, you are reported to have stated as follows: He had told them, that is the Asiatics, that the law would not be repealed so long as there was an Asiatic in the country who had not registered. And again, until every Indian in the country had regis tered, the law would not be repealed.
('8', 424, 1, 7, 1005531) This shows that the only condi tion of repeal was complete registration.
('8', 424, 1, 8, 1005604) My Association need hardly say that practically every Asiatic in the Colony has made voluntary application in terms of the compromise.
('8', 424, 1, 9, 1005739) But now my Association understands that the Government, in exchange for repeal, ask British Indians to consent to the following: (a) That British Indians holding Dutch registration certificates, for which they have paid either 3 or 25, should become prohibited immigrants, whether they are within the Colony or outside the Colony.
('8', 424, 1, 10, 1006070) (b) That pre war Indian refugees, who have not yet returned to the Transvaal, should become prohibited immigrants.
('8', 424, 1, 11, 1006185) (c) That the voluntary applications which are now under consideration by the Registrar of Asiatics should be finally decided by the Registrar without the right of appeal to the Supreme Court.
('8', 424, 1, 12, 1006377) (d) That British Indians who can pass the severe test under the Immigrants Restriction Act should also be treated as prohibited immigrants.
('8', 424, 1, 13, 1006517) My Association ventures respectfully to submit that it is highly unfair to ask the British Indian community of the Transvaal to consent to a deprivation of the rights of some, in whose name the community cannot even speak With any effect.
('8', 424, 1, 14, 1006756) It would be one thing for the Government to pass legislation independently of the community affected thereby, and another thing to ask the community to consent to such legislation restrictive of the liberty of a portion of that class.
('8', 424, 1, 15, 1006991) With reference to (a) and (b), my Association ventures to state that their claims have never been summarily rejected, as it is now
('8', 424, 2, 16, 1007122) 1 On February 6, 1908
('8', 425, 0, 1, 1007144) 426 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 425, 1, 2, 1007186) proposed, but that pre war refugees have received more or less consideration and have been granted permits to return.
('8', 425, 1, 3, 1007304) The repeated declarations of responsible officials after British occupation have made it perfectly clear that the domiciliary rights of pre war Asiatic residents would be respected.
('8', 425, 1, 4, 1007486) In wishing to treat such people now as prohibited immigrants, a most novel and, for British Indians, painful, position is sought to be created.
('8', 425, 1, 5, 1007630) My Association is quite willing that the burden of proving bona fide ownership of registration certificates should be thrown on the holders, and that the claims of those pre war residents who do not hold registration certificates should be limited to residence for a fixed period of, say, two years, such residence to be proved to the satisfaction of a court of law, always with the right of appeal to the Supreme Court so as to bring decisions of different lower courts into harmony.
('8', 425, 1, 6, 1008115) My Association further, in order to prevent any possible frauds, is prepared to accept a reasonable period within which all these outstanding claims should be submitted.
('8', 425, 1, 7, 1008285) It is within the knowledge of my Association that at least one Indian is outside the Colony who paid, in 1885, the sum of 25 to purchase his domicile in terms of Law 3 of 1885 before it was amended, and who holds European credentials, and has not yet been allowed to return.
('8', 425, 1, 8, 1008560) There are several such cases, though not of payment of 25 but of 3. My Association invites your attention to the following clause in Law 3 of 1885, which shows clearly that the fee of 3 was imposed to entitle the payer to settlement in the country:
('8', 425, 2, 9, 1008809) Those who settle in the Republic for the purposed carrying on any wade or otherwise shall be bound to have their names entered in a register to be separately kept for the purpose by the Landdrosts of the various districts, in accordance with a form to be prescribed by the Government.
('8', 425, 2, 10, 1009094) On suchregistra tion, which shall be effected within eight days after arrival, a sum of 25 sterling (subsequently 3) shall be paid.
('8', 425, 2, 11, 1009226) With reference to (c), it would be manifestly unfair to deprive those Indians who have already applied for voluntary registration of the right of having their claims examined judicially, when the claims of those who are entitled to return may be judicially examined, My Association fails to see any reason for such a differential treatment between Indians having similar claims.
('8', 425, 2, 12, 1009605) With reference to (d), my Association cannot help feeling that the proposal that Indians domiciled in the Transvaal should be consenting parties to the deprivation of the rights of Indians with high educational attainments, professional men, to whom British Indians in general are always prone to look up for assistance, is extraordinary.
('8', 425, 2, 13, 1009944) My Association respectfully contends that the interpretation of the
('8', 426, 0, 1, 1010012) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 427
('8', 426, 1, 2, 1010057) Immigrants Restriction Act leaves it open for Indians with European education to enter the country, and the fact that Mr. Sorabji, who has entered the country to test such interpretation, is now to be tried under the Asiatic Act for failing to produce a registration certificate, seems to uphold the contention of my Association and to show that the Government have abandoned their interpretation of the Immigrants Restriction Act.
('8', 426, 1, 3, 1010489) My Association thinks that, so far as the European Colonists are concerned, in this question there is no substantial point involved, whereas it is one of deeply cherished sentiment to British Indians.
('8', 426, 1, 4, 1010690) In effect, the vast majority of even educated Indians will be shut out of the Colony because of the stringency of the test, and my Association does not object to any reasonable stringency, so long as education of a real type is respected and recognized as much in an Indian as in a European.
('8', 426, 1, 5, 1010982) In Natal, where the test is by no means so severe as in the Transvaal, according to the last Immigration Report, only a few Indians 1 entered under the test 2 Australia, which has also a similar education test, has successfully solved the problem of Asiatic immigration.
('8', 426, 1, 6, 1011253) My Association, therefore, ventures to trust that the Transvaal will not be an exception, and that the Government will be pleased to spare the natural feelings of British Indians in the matter.
('8', 426, 1, 7, 1011447) My Association, in conclusion, respectfully trusts that the Gov ernment will take into serious consideration the above representation, and finally close the Asiatic question so far as it is affected by the Asiatic Law Amendment Act; and thus, not only fulfil its part of the compromise, but give the lawful Asiatic residents of the Colony the rest and peace to which their conduct during the recent trouble has, by universal acknowledgement, entitled them; and, last but not least, to save the British Indians from the step to which they are committed, as above mentioned, in the event of the Governments unfavourable decision.

('8', 427, 2, 3, 1012407) [JOHANNESBURG, July 8, 1908]
('8', 427, 3, 4, 1012436) The first case called was that of Sorabji, charged under Act No.
('8', 427, 3, 5, 1012501) 2 of 1907 with being in the Colony without a permit.
('8', 427, 4, 6, 1012554) THE MAGISTRATE: What do you plead ?
('8', 427, 5, 7, 1012590) ACCUSED: [in a clear voice] I am not guilty.
('8', 427, 6, 8, 1012635) Superintendent Vernon stated that he arrested the accused on the 4th instant.
('8', 427, 6, 9, 1012713) 1 He called upon him to produce a registration certificate under the Act 2 his authority to enter or reside in the Colony.
('8', 427, 6, 10, 1012836) He replied: I have no authority or registration certificate. Witness then charged him under section 8, sub section 3 of the Act.
('8', 427, 6, 11, 1012965) Accused entered the Colony on June 24 last at 6.09 p.m.
('8', 427, 6, 12, 1013021) He saw accused every day up to the date of his arrest.
('8', 427, 7, 13, 1013076) [SUPERINTENDENT VERNON:] (Cross examined by Mr. Gandhi) Accused knows English.
('8', 427, 7, 14, 1013155) He knows it well enough to understand what I said to him.
('8', 427, 7, 15, 1013213) [GANDHIJI:] And well enough to comply with the Immigration Restriction Act?
('8', 427, 8, 16, 1013289) [VERNON:] I have nothing to do with that.
('8', 427, 8, 17, 1013331) I cannot give any opinion.
('8', 427, 9, 18, 1013358) Mr. Chamney, Registrar of Asiatics, said he did not know accused, but a man of the same name applied through the Magistrates office at Volksrust on April 22, 1908 for a permit.
('8', 427, 9, 19, 1013535) He applied for registration and not for a certificate of registration under the Act.
('8', 427, 9, 20, 1013620) Witness considered the claims of the applicant and found that he was not entitled to registration and he informed the Magistrate of Volksrust accordingly.
('8', 427, 9, 21, 1013775) Witness conveyed the instructions to the police to arrest the accused, though the instructions did not originate with him.
('8', 427, 10, 22, 1013898) Cross examined, [he said that] the application made by the defendant was for voluntary registration in accordance with the compromise with the Government.
('8', 427, 11, 23, 1014053) Witness explained that he did not know how the defendant came to be in Volksrust.
('8', 427, 11, 24, 1014135) The compromise was intended for those in the Colony or those who hadthe right to return within three months.
('8', 427, 11, 25, 1014244) Accompanying the application were a number of certificates of character.
('8', 427, 12, 26, 1014317) Mr. Gandhi asked witness to read the certificates.
('8', 427, 12, 27, 1014368) The Public Prosecutor objected.
('8', 427, 12, 28, 1014400) 3 Mr. Gandhi argued that the papers were part of the record.
('8', 427, 13, 29, 1014461) 1 The Transvaal Leader version of the trial has the 3rd July, 1908 while Indian Opinion does not mention the date.
('8', 427, 13, 30, 1014576) 2 Act 2 of 1907 3 At this stage of the proceedings, Chamney consulted the Crown Prosecutor and again later through Superintendent Vernonto which Gandhiji objected.
('8', 428, 0, 1, 1014740) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 429
('8', 428, 1, 2, 1014785) THE MAGISTRATE: You want to set up a defence that he is brought under the wrong Act.
('8', 428, 1, 3, 1014870) You want to bring him under the Immigration Ordinance.
('8', 428, 1, 4, 1014925) MR. GANDHI: I do, Sir.
('8', 428, 2, 5, 1014948) THE MAGISTRATE: I quite understand.
('8', 428, 3, 6, 1014984) The Public Prosecutor argued that the documents must be proved in the ordinary way.
('8', 428, 3, 7, 1015068) Mr. Gandhi retorted that he could not prove if the witness did not produce them.
('8', 428, 3, 8, 1015149) They were the property of his client, and he had served notice on witness to produce them.
('8', 428, 3, 9, 1015240) The Public Prosecutor persisted in his objection, and eventually the Magistrate looked at the documents.
('8', 428, 3, 10, 1015345) He said they bore the headline South African Constabulary, and apparently belonged to them.
('8', 428, 4, 11, 1015437) Mr. Gandhi proceeded with the cross examination of witness, who stated he was Chief Immigration Officer also.
('8', 428, 4, 12, 1015547) He had received a telegram from Mr. Gandhi telling him that the defendant was to entrain and that he possessed the necessary qualifications under the Immigration Act and had sufficient means.
('8', 428, 5, 13, 1015739) [GANDHIJI:] Did your officers [at Volksrust] examine the defendant as to his educational abilities?
('8', 428, 6, 14, 1015839) [CHAMNEY:] No.
('8', 428, 6, 15, 1015854) Will you admit he has sufficient educational attainments?
('8', 428, 7, 16, 1015912) I know nothing about it.
('8', 428, 7, 17, 1015937) Will you admit he has sufficient means ?
('8', 428, 8, 18, 1015978) I know nothing about it.
('8', 428, 8, 19, 1016003) This charge has nothing to do with it.
('8', 428, 8, 20, 1016042) Did you allow any other Asiatic to pass?
('8', 428, 9, 21, 1016083) I have.
('8', 428, 9, 22, 1016091) Unchallenged?
('8', 428, 10, 23, 1016105) Not unchallenged; he was not unchallenged.
('8', 428, 11, 24, 1016148) What was done to him?
('8', 428, 12, 25, 1016170) I am not able to say.
('8', 428, 12, 26, 1016192) I decline absolutely to answer that question.
('8', 428, 12, 27, 1016238) I dare say you will know in full time.
('8', 428, 12, 28, 1016277) Why was he allowed to pass?
('8', 428, 13, 29, 1016305) I will not reply to that.
('8', 428, 13, 30, 1016331) He came in here in conflict with the law, and the consequence is he is now there accused.The Magistrate again intervened and said Mr. Gandhi was referring to the Immigration Act, while the accused was charged under the Asiatic Act.
('8', 428, 14, 31, 1016563) MR. GANDHI: It is a most unfortunate position you place me in.
('8', 428, 14, 32, 1016626) You have not heard my defence.
('8', 428, 14, 33, 1016657) As Chief Immigration Officer, would you pass an Asiatic who possesses educational attainments under the
('8', 428, 15, 34, 1016761) 1 A Gujarati report of the trial in Indian Opinion, 18 7 1908, mentions that Chamney admitted to having examined the accused at the time of his entry for purposes of establishing his identity.

('8', 429, 1, 2, 1016996) Immigrants, Act?
('8', 429, 2, 3, 1017013) [CHAMNEY:] Certainly not.
('8', 429, 2, 4, 1017039) Why not?
('8', 429, 2, 5, 1017048) He is a prohibited immigrant.
('8', 429, 3, 6, 1017078) This closed the case for the Crown.
('8', 429, 4, 7, 1017114) A TECHNICAL POINT
('8', 429, 5, 8, 1017132) Mr. Gandhi asked for discharge of his client under sub section 3 of section 8, under which he was charged, on the ground that the sub section laid down that any Asiatic found in the Colony after such a date as may be notified in the Gazette [etc.]. That notice had not been proved, and the Court had not the notice in the Gazette in its possession.
('8', 429, 6, 9, 1017481) After argument, Mr. Gandhi said he knew it was a technical error, but it paid the defence to take such action.
('8', 429, 7, 10, 1017592) THE MAGISTRATE: And bring him up again, and give as much trouble as possible.
('8', 429, 8, 11, 1017670) MR. GANDHI: Thats the point.
('8', 429, 9, 12, 1017699) The Magistrate said he would look up some other cases, and give his decision next morning.

('8', 429, 11, 15, 1017904) Mr. Justice Solomon heldthat Mr. Smuts application [sic] had no relevance to the compro mise.
('8', 429, 12, 16, 1017998) 1 The Gujarati report mentions that, on further cross examination by Gandhiji, Chamney admitted to having allowed this prohibited immigrant to enter.
('8', 429, 12, 17, 1018148) 2 Gandhiji, according to the Gujarati report, had further argued that oral evidence was not enough to establish that the time limit of registration had expired.
('8', 429, 12, 18, 1018309) 3 The following news item appeared in Indian Opinion, 11 7 1908, bearing the date July 9: Mr. Sorabji Shapurjis case came before the Court today; the Magistrate upheld Mr. Gandhis contention and discharged the accused, finding him not guilty.
('8', 429, 12, 19, 1018552) Mr. Sorabji immediately received warning to appear before the Court tomorrow (Friday) to answer to a similar charge, on instructions from the Magis trate.
('8', 429, 12, 20, 1018707) . 4 From the judgment in reported speech: .
('8', 429, 12, 21, 1018751) .Certainly no such promise [regarding repeal] was contained in the letters, nor anything to show that such was the intention of the Colonial Secretary.
('8', 429, 12, 22, 1018903) It seemed

('8', 430, 1, 2, 1018958) He also observed that the letter addressed [to General Smuts] from gaol and Mr. Smuts reply to it did not throw any light on the repeal of the Act.
('8', 430, 1, 3, 1019106) The return of the application for voluntary registration could not be demanded since it was a kind of letter.
('8', 430, 1, 4, 1019216) Under the law, a letter belongs to the person to whom it is addressed.
('8', 430, 1, 5, 1019287) By the same token the application belonged to the Government.
('8', 430, 1, 6, 1019349) At the same time the Judge conceded the right to withdraw [the request contained in] the application.
('8', 430, 1, 7, 1019451) Only, the application form itself need not be retur ned.
('8', 430, 1, 8, 1019508) If one wanted to withdraw ones application, the Judge said, all that one had to do was not to accept the registration certificate.
('8', 430, 1, 9, 1019639) The Government were bound to return the permit and the old register.
('8', 430, 1, 10, 1019708) Since, however, the case had been instituted for the return of the appli cation, the costs were also awarded against the Indian community.
('8', 430, 1, 11, 1019847) Mr. Smuts filed an affidavit to the effect that he had never promised to repeal the Act.
('8', 430, 1, 12, 1019936) Mr. Chamney filed a similar affidavit.
('8', 430, 1, 13, 1019975) Mr. Ward fought hard and advanced a number of well reasoned arguments.
('8', 430, 1, 14, 1020046) But the Judge had got it into his head that an application is a kind of letter.
('8', 430, 1, 15, 1020126) The judgment has disheartened many Indians.
('8', 430, 1, 16, 1020170) A satyagrahi can never have reason to lose heart.
('8', 430, 1, 17, 1020220) Khuda is the ultimate court of appeal for a satyagrahi, and in that court false evidence does not avail.
('8', 430, 1, 18, 1020325) Moreover, our object in demanding that the applications be returned was to make certain that we were arrested as early as possible.
('8', 430, 1, 19, 1020457) We must achieve the same object now by burning the registers.
('8', 430, 1, 20, 1020519) This will appear a little difficult, but in fact it can be done easily.
('8', 430, 1, 21, 1020591) Anyone who is sensible enough will see that it is better to burn the register than to have the application returned.
('8', 430, 1, 22, 1020708) The Act, it appears, is a good as repealed.
('8', 430, 1, 23, 1020752) In a speech 1 on February 6 in Johannesburg, General Smuts said: I have told the Asiatics that the Act will be repealed if all of them take out registers
('8', 430, 2, 24, 1020906) extremely improbable that the Colonial Secretary would have agreed to repeal the Act, and, in a letter by the Asiatics to the Colonial Secretary, they said: `We recognize that it is not possible during the Parliamentary recess to repeal the Act, and we have noted your repeated public declarations that there is no likelihood of the Act being repealed, [cf.
('8', 430, 2, 25, 1021264) 40 2] from which it would appear that they accepted the position that the Act would not be repealed.
('8', 430, 2, 26, 1021365) .But, having handed it over the Registrar of Asiatics, with the intention.
('8', 430, 2, 27, 1021440) .that the latter should retain the document, .
('8', 430, 2, 28, 1021487) and the document then became the property of the Registrar of Asiatics.
('8', 430, 2, 29, 1021559) The application would therefore be refused with costs. Indian Opinion, 11 7 1908 1 Vide Letter to Colonial Secretary,6 7 1908

('8', 431, 1, 3, 1021740) It will not be repealed unless this is done. The reference to the repeal of the Act cannot be plainer.
('8', 431, 1, 4, 1021843) The day after the Supreme Court delivered its judgment, the entire correspondence [between General Smuts and] Mr. Gandhi was released to the Press.
('8', 431, 1, 5, 1021991) Along with that, Mr. Gandhi addressed a letter 1
('8', 431, 2, 6, 1022040) to the Press on the 2nd [of July], to which no one has replied [so far].
('8', 431, 3, 7, 1022113) HELP FROM WHITES
('8', 431, 4, 8, 1022130) Meanwhile, the whites 2 who have been helping us have started making fresh efforts [towards a compromise].
('8', 431, 4, 9, 1022237) General Smuts has let it be known that he is prepared to concede the right of those who hold the 3 [certificates].
('8', 431, 4, 10, 1022352) He is also prepared to allow appeals against Mr. Chamneys decisions.
('8', 431, 4, 11, 1022421) He wants Indians to agree only to the exclusion of educated persons [from the Colony in the future].
('8', 431, 4, 12, 1022522) This the Indians refuse to do.
('8', 431, 4, 13, 1022553) A meeting 3 was accordingly held on Sunday.
('8', 431, 4, 14, 1022597) About 800 persons assembled at the Hamidia Mosque.
('8', 431, 4, 15, 1022648) The meeting was addres sed by Messrs Essop Mia, Imam Abdool Kadir, Cama, Gulabbhai, Cachalia, Polak, Gandhi, Khurshedji and others.
('8', 431, 4, 16, 1022780) It was decided in the end to hold a mass meeting the following Sunday and at that meeting to [burn the registration certificates].
('8', 431, 5, 17, 1022911) BURN REGISTERS
('8', 431, 6, 18, 1022926) This will be done only if [meanwhile] the Government does not concede all our four demands.
('8', 431, 7, 19, 1023018) ESSOP MIAS LETTER
('8', 431, 8, 20, 1023036) After the meeting [held last Sunday] Mr. Essop Mia wrote to Mr. Smuts, asking him explicitly to declare that the Government did not intend to concede the Indians, demands, if that was in fact its intention, for in that case [the Indian community] had resolved to hold a meeting on the following Sunday and burn the certificates.
('8', 431, 9, 21, 1023365) (This letter will be found elsewhere in this issue.) If a favourable reply is received, and the Government agrees to repeal the Act uncondi tionally, nothing more will remain to be done, and there will be no need to burn the registers.

('8', 432, 1, 2, 1023794) DOKES LETTER
('8', 432, 2, 3, 1023807) The Transvaal Leader has published a letter from Mr. Doke.
('8', 432, 2, 4, 1023866) It is a spirited letter, worth reading, in which he has adduced very effective arguments to show that the Indian community is fully justified in its campaign [against the Act].
('8', 432, 2, 5, 1024043) That letter has won many whites over to our side, and their number is thus increasing daily.
('8', 432, 3, 6, 1024136) THE FRIEND OF BLOEMFONTEIN
('8', 432, 4, 7, 1024163) The Friend of Bloemfontein has again begun to write in our favour.
('8', 432, 4, 8, 1024230) It advises General Smuts not to carry the dispute further.
('8', 432, 4, 9, 1024289) Mr. Smuts fort is thus being beleaguered.
('8', 432, 4, 10, 1024331) The vessel of his sins is about to burst.
('8', 432, 4, 11, 1024373) The end is perhaps not far off.
('8', 432, 4, 12, 1024405) But a satyagrahi mustexpend no thought on whether the struggle will be a long or a short one.
('8', 432, 4, 13, 1024499) For him his truth is the dearest of all things.
('8', 432, 5, 14, 1024547) SORABJIS CASE
('8', 432, 6, 15, 1024561) Mr. Sorabji has been arrested, and released without bail.
('8', 432, 6, 16, 1024619) The hearing of the case was fixed for Saturday, but has been adjourned to Wednesday.
('8', 432, 6, 17, 1024704) Mr. Sorabji is now charged not under the Immigrants Act, but under the obnoxious Act.
('8', 432, 6, 18, 1024790) This shows that no action can be taken against him under the former.
('8', 432, 6, 19, 1024859) MR. Sorabji does not want to submit to the obnoxious Act nor to leave the Transvaal.
('8', 432, 6, 20, 1024944) If, therefore, he is given notice to leave, he will disregard it and court imprison ment.
('8', 432, 6, 21, 1025034) Mr. Sorabji also addressed the meeting on Sunday, and every one was happy with his decision to go to gaol.

('8', 432, 10, 26, 1025334) Jaymals case is likely to lead to other similar cases.
('8', 432, 10, 27, 1025389) A tailor named Dahya, who came to Johannesburg with a permit obtained from one Jaymal, has been arrested.
('8', 432, 10, 28, 1025495) He is believed to have obtained the permit under a genuine misconception.

('8', 433, 2, 4, 1025965) Wednesday [July 8, 1908] Mr. Sorabjis case was heard in Mr. Jordans court on Wednesday.
('8', 433, 2, 5, 1026053) 1 Giving evidence, Mr. Chamney admitted that Mr. Sorabji was not, and could not be, arrested under the Immigrants Act.
('8', 433, 2, 6, 1026172) He said there was an important reason why Mr. Sorabji had not been arrested [earlier].
('8', 433, 2, 7, 1026259) There was a heated exchange of arguments in the Court.
('8', 433, 2, 8, 1026314) The court room was overflowing with Indians.
('8', 433, 2, 9, 1026359) Mr. Gandhi asked for Mr. Sorabjis discharge on a technical point of law.
('8', 433, 2, 10, 1026432) The Magistrate has promised a ruling on Friday.
('8', 433, 2, 11, 1026480) Be that as it may.
('8', 433, 2, 12, 1026499) That will not decide the fundamental issue.
('8', 433, 2, 13, 1026543) But it is desirable on such occasions to take advantage of other technical flaws of a legal nature [which may not have a direct bearing on the main issue].

('8', 433, 4, 15, 1026709) On Saturday, July 4, Mr. Suleman Mia, Mr. Essop Mias younger brother, lost his child, who was a little over ten months old.
('8', 433, 4, 16, 1026833) I feel sad at this unhappy event.

('8', 434, 3, 4, 1027060) THE HONBLE THE COLONIAL SECRETARY PRETORIA
('8', 434, 4, 5, 1027103) SIR, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant 1 in reply to mine of the 1st instant 2 regarding Asiatic licences.
('8', 434, 4, 6, 1027255) My Association has taken the extreme step after very great and due deliberation, and with much regret, and only when there was no other way possible.
('8', 434, 4, 7, 1027405) My Association is still most anxious to avoid what may develop into a very bitter struggle, and to avoid any defiance of the laws of the land they live in, but, when it becomes a matter of choosing between respect for laws and ones conscience, there can be, in my humble opinion, no hesitation about the choice to be made.
('8', 434, 4, 8, 1027728) My Association is still most willing to advise the people to tender the licence fee.
('8', 434, 4, 9, 1027813) My Association understands that thumb impressions under the Asiatic Act are now being asked for from Asiatic applicants for licences.
('8', 434, 4, 10, 1027947) This, again, in my humble opinion, is a breach of the compromise, within the meaning given to it by my Association, namely, that the Act should not apply to those who have made voluntary application for registration.
('8', 434, 4, 11, 1028164) With reference to the letter 3 of my Association dated the 6th instant, many European friends have advised that the mass meeting for the burning of the voluntary registration certificates should be postponed, pending the final decision of the Government.
('8', 434, 4, 12, 1028419) My Association has also heardthat the Government are prepared to waive the first three points mentioned in my letter, but that the education testis the stumbling block.
('8', 434, 4, 13, 1028588) If so, and if it is not too late, my Association hopes that the difficulty will be overcome by providing
('8', 434, 5, 14, 1028693) 1 In this, Gorges, the Assistant Colonial Secretary, had said that Asiatics failing to produce certificates of registration were not entitled to receive licences.
('8', 434, 5, 15, 1028856) He regretted the Associations extreme step of advising Transvaal Indians to carry on trade in conflict with the law.

('8', 435, 6, 7, 1029280) [JOHANNESBURG,] July 9, 1908
('8', 435, 7, 8, 1029309) DEAR MR. CARTWRIGHT, I am very much obliged to you for your note and for the great interest you are taking in the troubles of my countrymen.
('8', 435, 7, 9, 1029450) I would lose much rather than the sympathy of public men in the Transvaal.
('8', 435, 7, 10, 1029525) The burning of the certificates next Sunday will, therefore, be postponed.
('8', 435, 7, 11, 1029600) I take it that you are closely following the development of the struggle.
('8', 435, 7, 12, 1029674) Mr. Sorabji, as you Known, is not now to be tried under the Im migrants Restriction Act at all.
('8', 435, 7, 13, 1029770) 1 Indeed, to secure conviction under that Act will, in the case of an educated Asiatic, be, I am sure, impo ssible, without the instrumentality of the Asiatic Act.
('8', 435, 7, 14, 1029934) It just proves my contention.
('8', 435, 7, 15, 1029964) Owing to the stupidity of the Prosecution and the greater stupidity of Mr. Chamney, I was able to take advantage of a flaw in the evidence for the Crown, and Mr. Sorabji was discharged.
('8', 435, 7, 16, 1030150) To show the vindictiveness on the part of Superintendent Vernon and Mr. Cha mney, he was re arrested immediately, Mr. Vernon saying the re arrest was being effected under instructions from Mr. Chamney.
('8', 435, 7, 17, 1030352) As luck would have it, I went over with Mr. Sorabji to Marshall Square Police Station and saw Deputy Commissioner Potter, who, I believe, perceived the mistake that had been made, and almost immediately after I had seen him, ordered Mr. Sorabjis discharge from custody.
('8', 435, 7, 18, 1030622) I do not know what will happen tomorrow.
('8', 435, 7, 19, 1030663) I am half inclined to think that there will be a bungle again.
('8', 435, 7, 20, 1030726) If so, I propose to take advantage of it and secure a discharge again.
('8', 435, 7, 21, 1030797) Ultimately, of course, Mr. Sorabji, unless some settlement is arrived at, must pay the penalty for wearing a brown skin and go to gaol.
('8', 435, 7, 22, 1030933) He seems to me to be a determined young man, and wishes to offer himself as a sacrifice on behalf of his edu

('8', 436, 2, 7, 1031539) I hope you will pardon me for inflicting all this upon you, but, as you are there, amid your many activities, doing the Asiatic work also, I thought I should pass on to you all the information in my possession.

('8', 436, 7, 12, 1031908) [JOHANNESBURG,] July 10, 1908 [THE EDITOR THE TRANSVAAL LEADER
('8', 436, 8, 13, 1031971) SIR,] You advise Asiatics to do nothing rash and to await develop ments regarding the renewal of the Asiatic struggle.
('8', 436, 8, 14, 1032090) It is, therefore, with much regret that I have to draw your attention to a circular letter addressed to the Town Clerks in the Transvaal, over the signature of theRegistrar of Asiatics, and dated as recently as the 7th instant, which
('8', 436, 9, 15, 1032324) 1 Vide  Letter to Colonial Secretary, 6 7 1908. 2 Vide Letter to Colonial Secretary, 9 8 1908 3 This was in reply to the Leaders editorial of July 10, 1908, which was reproduced in Indian Opinion, 18 7 1908, under the title The Transvaal Trouble: How Government Promises Are Fulfilled.
('8', 436, 9, 16, 1032610) The Leader had expressed the hope that the Asiatics would not take steps of a sensational nature in pursuance of their contention with the Government for that might put Parliament, then in session, in its sternest mood.
('8', 436, 9, 17, 1032830) Adverting to a comment on the situation by The Friend of Bloemfontein, the Leader further said that the advice that the compromise should be redeemed could be given to both sides, but urged Asiatics to recognize that in no circumstances would the Colonys Europeans open the door to fresh immigration.

('8', 437, 1, 2, 1033173) runs as follows:
('8', 437, 2, 3, 1033190) I have the honour to inform you that it has been decided that Act No.
('8', 437, 2, 4, 1033260) 2 of 1907 is to remain on the Statute book; consequently all Asiatics applying for licences to trade must be required to produce a registration certificate issued under the Act, or in the form of the voluntary certificate, a specimen of which is attached, and to furnish a clear impression of their right hand thumb for examination in this Office.
('8', 437, 2, 5, 1033608) Any Asiatic who fails to carry out these requirements is not entitled to the issue or renewal of any trading licence.
('8', 437, 3, 6, 1033726) The thumb impression should be forwarded as soon as possible to this office, together with the name of the applicant, and the number of the registration certificate held by him.
('8', 437, 3, 7, 1033904) You will notice that the circular states the decision of the Government to retain Act 2 of 1907 on the Statute book, and evide ntly to legalize voluntary registration under it.
('8', 437, 3, 8, 1034081) If so, can Asiatics have any patience, and can they have any trust in the promise, written or verbal, of the Government?
('8', 437, 3, 9, 1034202) The circular, if it correctly sets forth the Governments decision, is a tremendous eye opener.
('8', 437, 3, 10, 1034297) However, the mass meeting advertised for the burning of registration certificates remains postponed, and every Asiatic awaits publication of the Gove rnments declarations.
('8', 437, 3, 11, 1034469) The only reason for drawing public attention to the circular which I have been able to secure is to show that, when Asiatics take any irrevocable step, it will not be without the gravest provocation.

('8', 437, 5, 14, 1034756) [JOHANNESBURG, July 10, 1908]
('8', 437, 6, 15, 1034786) On Friday, the 10th instant, before Mr. Jordan, in B Court, Mr. Sorabji Shapurji, the Parsi gentleman, who had already been acquitted of a similar charge, 1 was charged, in terms of Section 8, Sub Section 3 of Act 2 of 1907, with having failed to produce a registration certificate issued under the Act, when the same was demanded of him by Superintendent Vernon, on the 9th instant.
('8', 437, 6, 16, 1035170) Mr. Cramer prosecuted for the Crown, and Mr. Gandhi appeared for the defence.
('8', 437, 7, 17, 1035248) Before replying generally to the indictment, Mr. Gandhi raised the plea
('8', 437, 8, 18, 1035320) 1 For earlier judgment, vide 3rd n footnote of Johannesburg Letter, 7 7 1908.

('8', 438, 1, 2, 1035443) of autre fois acquit claiming that the accused had already been discharged in regard to the same offence.
('8', 438, 2, 3, 1035549) THE MAGISSTRATE: It is a continuous offence.
('8', 438, 3, 4, 1035594) Mr. Gandhi replied that he was aware of that, but claimed that, although the date in the indictment was given as July 9th, the accused should have been given eight clear days before being again brought before the Court and charged with the same offence.
('8', 438, 3, 5, 1035848) If the acquittal was worth anything to the accused, he should not be called upon to appear before the Court for another week.
('8', 438, 3, 6, 1035974) He did not for one moment, say that, for the purpose of his case, he required eight days.
('8', 438, 3, 7, 1036064) At the same time, there was that legal defence, and he was not justified in abandoning it.
('8', 438, 3, 8, 1036155) He claimed that the accused should have had a new lease of life from the preceding day, in accordance with the law.
('8', 438, 3, 9, 1036271) As it was, the accused was ruthlessly carried away from the Court Rude hands had been laid upon him, and he had not even been given the opportunity of leaving the Colony, if he had so desired, on the previous day.
('8', 438, 4, 10, 1036485) The Magistrate overruled the plea, and said that he would make a note of it.
('8', 438, 5, 11, 1036562) Superintendent Vernon gave formal evidence of arrest.
('8', 438, 5, 12, 1036616) He produced notices published in the Government Gazette containing official notifications by the Colonial Secretary that the time for registration under the Act expired on October 31, 1907, and the extension thereof on November 30, 1907.
('8', 438, 6, 13, 1036854) CROSS EXAMINED
('8', 438, 7, 14, 1036869) Witness was in Court the previous day, when accused was discharged.
('8', 438, 7, 15, 1036937) He had beckoned to him to come outside, and had arrested him outside the Court.
('8', 438, 7, 16, 1037017) It was a fact that between the time of accuseds discharge and his getting to the door of the Court he had not much time.
('8', 438, 8, 17, 1037138) Montford Chamney sated that he was Registrar of Asiatics.
('8', 438, 8, 18, 1037196) The accused had not applied for a certificate of registration under the Act 2 of 1907, nor had he been granted such a certificate.
('8', 438, 8, 19, 1037327) An application had been made for registration outside the provisions of the Act, but, upon consideration, witness found that accused was not entitled to registration.
('8', 438, 8, 20, 1037494) Witness proceeded that, under the Immigrants Restriction Act, the accused was not eligible to obtain such a certificate of registration.
('8', 438, 9, 21, 1037631) Mr. Gandhi objected to this statement on the ground that witnesss opinion as to the interpretation of the clause did not go for Anything, as he was not a judicial officer but merely an administrative officer.
('8', 438, 9, 22, 1037840) The Magistrate upheld the objection.
('8', 438, 10, 23, 1037877) Cross examined, witness stated that he had not examined the accused with reference to his educational qualifications.
('8', 438, 11, 24, 1037995) This closed the case for the prosecution.
('8', 439, 0, 1, 1038037) 440 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 439, 1, 2, 1038079) Mr. Gandhi immediately applied for the discharge of the accused, because, although notices had been proved, the proper notice had not been proved.
('8', 439, 1, 3, 1038226) The Notice that should have been proved before the Court was one notifying that persons found within the Colony after a certain date would be called upon to produce registration certificates.
('8', 439, 1, 4, 1038418) The notices produced only referred to application for registration, and had absolutely no bearing whatever on the case.
('8', 439, 1, 5, 1038538) After all, November 30 had already passed, and his client had never applied for registration.
('8', 439, 1, 6, 1038632) The Notice contemplated in the section of the Act on which the charge was based was a notice authorizing the police to demand registration certificates, and it was only under such a notice that registration certificates could be demanded.
('8', 439, 1, 7, 1038871) This had not been proved.
('8', 439, 1, 8, 1038897) A lengthy argument resulted in Mr. Gandhi producing the required Notice.
('8', 439, 1, 9, 1038970) He would help the prosecution to that extent in regard to the third prosecution of the accused, but not in the present, holding that it was impossible for the Crown to obtain a conviction in the present case.
('8', 439, 1, 10, 1039179) He read the Notice.
('8', 439, 1, 11, 1039199) It set forth that the Government had appointed November 30, 1907 as the date after which any Asiatic over the age of sixteen who was found within the Colony and failed upon demand by any duly authorized person to produce a certificate of registration of which he was the lawful holder might be arrested and dealt with as provided.
('8', 439, 1, 12, 1039530) That Notice had never been put in.
('8', 439, 2, 13, 1039565) THE MAGISSTRATE: The question is whether the putting in of the Gazette is not sufficient notice in itself.
('8', 439, 3, 14, 1039672) Mr. Gandhi said that he felt it very keenly that such an argument should be adduced, after he had shown that his contention was correct.
('8', 439, 3, 15, 1039809) He still argued that the two notices produced by the Crown did not apply to the case at all.
('8', 439, 3, 16, 1039902) It was not his fault that he had over argued the case.
('8', 439, 3, 17, 1039957) The notice required had not been put in by the Crown and had not even been cited in the indictment.
('8', 439, 4, 18, 1040057) Mr. Jordan then adjourned the Court for luncheon, and intimated that he would give his decision upon resuming.
('8', 439, 5, 19, 1040168) When the Court resumed, the Public Prosecutor said that it appeared to be absolutely essential that the Gazette containing the notice should be produced in Court.
('8', 439, 5, 20, 1040331) Mr. Gandhi had taken advantage, and rightly so from his point of view, of a purely technical point, and he asked His Worship to allow him also to take advantage of a technicality.
('8', 439, 5, 21, 1040511) He asked His Worship to take it that the production of the Gazette and the reading of the notices by Mr. Gandhi was sufficient publication for the purposes of the case.
('8', 439, 6, 22, 1040680) In reply, Mr. Gandhi contended that he had not put in the Gazette.
('8', 439, 6, 23, 1040747) The Notice had never been put in at all.
('8', 439, 6, 24, 1040788) He had simply produced it as he would produce a law book to carry conviction to the Court as he was in the unfortunate position of not being able to make himself otherwise understood, but it would be unfair to penalize him for having helped the Court.
('8', 439, 6, 25, 1041040) In point of fact, so far as the evidence was concerned, the notice required by the law was
('8', 440, 0, 1, 1041131) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 441
('8', 440, 1, 2, 1041176) not within the judicial cognizance of the Court.
('8', 440, 2, 3, 1041225) The Magistrate said that he would take judicial notice of Mr. Gandhis argument, but overruled him.
('8', 440, 3, 4, 1041324) The accused was then called, and stated, in examination, that he had been in South Africa for six years, in Durban for a year and a half, and in Charlestown for four and a half years.
('8', 440, 3, 5, 1041508) He was book keeper and manager of the store of Mr. Hajee Hassam, of Charlestown, Natal.
('8', 440, 3, 6, 1041596) He received his English education at the Surat High School in the Bombay Presidency.
('8', 440, 3, 7, 1041681) He had received seven years education through the medium of the English language, and before that, seven years in the vernacular.
('8', 440, 3, 8, 1041811) He had entered the Transvaal under the Immigrants Restriction Act.
('8', 440, 4, 9, 1041878) THE MAGISSTRATE: How can he ?
('8', 440, 5, 10, 1041908) Mr. Gandhi said that that was for him to show.
('8', 440, 5, 11, 1041955) It was for him to argue that accused was entitled to enter, after he had put the facts before the Court, but it was not possible for the Court to decide that question before the facts had been placed before it and properly argued when the right time came.
('8', 440, 6, 12, 1042211) The Magistrate stated that Mr. Gandhi had to show that his client was one of those exempted.
('8', 440, 7, 13, 1042304) Mr. Gandhi argued that as his client was educated and had means, he was entitled to enter the Transvaal under the Immigrants Restriction Act.
('8', 440, 8, 14, 1042446) THE MAGISSTRATE: Do you mean to say that every Asiatic who can read and write in a European language can come into this Colony?
('8', 440, 8, 15, 1042574) MR. GANDHI: I do, Sir, and I am going to try and argue that before the Court, if I get the opportunity.
('8', 440, 9, 16, 1042678) Proceeding, witness stated that, when he entered the country, he had sufficient means.
('8', 440, 9, 17, 1042765) He was asked by Sergeant Mansfield of the South African Constabulary, the officer in charge of the Immigration Department at Volk srust, how much money he had.
('8', 440, 9, 18, 1042925) He had made an application for voluntary registration on the 22nd April last, having received written permission from Sergeant Mansfield to enter the Colony and make application.
('8', 440, 9, 19, 1043104) He held several testimonials from prominent townsmen, and some of these had been sent to Mr. Chamney in connection with his application.
('8', 440, 9, 20, 1043241) He had been discharged on the previous day on a similar charge to that whereon he was now brought before the Court.
('8', 440, 9, 21, 1043357) 1 He had no wish to apply under the Registration Act No.

('8', 440, 10, 23, 1043425) CROSS EXAMINED
('8', 440, 11, 24, 1043440) He was fully conversant with the provisions of that Act.
('8', 440, 11, 25, 1043497) He knew what steps should be taken for obtaining a registration certificate.
('8', 440, 11, 26, 1043574) He had never applied for registration under the Act, and had no desire to apply.

('8', 441, 1, 2, 1043751) never apply or have anything to do with such an un British and disgraceful Act, and associated himself with his brethren in opposition to the Act.
('8', 441, 1, 3, 1043898) He had not come only for the purpose of making this a test case, but in order to make the Transvaal his home.
('8', 441, 1, 4, 1044008) He had come to reside in the Transvaal.
('8', 441, 1, 5, 1044048) Charlestown was his last place of residence, and he had never resided in the Transvaal before.
('8', 441, 1, 6, 1044143) It was his own intention to come to the Transvaal; he had never come by anyones advice, but of his own accord.
('8', 441, 1, 7, 1044254) He had, however, asked Mr. Gandhis opinion in a legal capacity first.
('8', 441, 1, 8, 1044324) The application that he made through the Magistrates Office at Volksrust had been refused.
('8', 441, 1, 9, 1044415) Since he came to Johannesburg, he lived in the Malay Location with Mr. Cama.
('8', 441, 1, 10, 1044492) It was not a fact that, prior to his entering the Transvaal, he had been in constant communication with the British Indian Association.
('8', 441, 2, 11, 1044628) Re examined, he stated that he was a British subject, and a Parsi.
('8', 441, 3, 12, 1044695) This closed the case for the defence.
('8', 441, 4, 13, 1044733) Mr. Gandhi argued his case at length.
('8', 441, 4, 14, 1044771) He first submitted that his client was not a prohibited immigrant under the Immigrants Restriction Act, in as much as he had shown that he had sufficient means and educational attain ments, and if he chose to apply under the Asiatic Act he would not be a prohi bited immigrant.
('8', 441, 4, 15, 1045049) He proceeded to argue that the Asiatic Act referred only to Asiatics who were in the Colony, and who resided in the Colony before the Act was passed, and, whatever the intention of the framers of the Immigrants Res triction Act, it left the door open for Asiatic immigrationundoubtedly of a very modified type.
('8', 441, 5, 16, 1045360) The Magistrate referred to Mr. Gandhis argument as very subtle and very able.
('8', 441, 5, 17, 1045438) He dealt with the points raised, and said that the accused had not made application for registration, but he gloried in the fact, and had set the Government at defiance.
('8', 441, 5, 18, 1045608) He ordered him to leave the Colony within seven days.

('8', 441, 7, 21, 1045716) It is known the world over that the Hindus cremate their dead.
('8', 441, 7, 22, 1045779) A request was made to the Government that cremation facilities similarto those available in Durban be provided for the Colony as a whole, and to this Mr. Diwan has received a very discouraging reply.
('8', 441, 7, 23, 1045979) The Government has said, without assigning any reasons, that the arrangements asked for cannot be made.
('8', 441, 7, 24, 1046083) Admittedly, there have been numerous instances of Hindus burying their dead, but we cannot put up with peremptory interference with a religious practice.
('8', 441, 7, 25, 1046237) We may argue that the Hindus themselves are to blame for not having always insisted on cremating their dead because of the inconvenience in

('8', 442, 1, 2, 1046422) doing so or for other reasons.
('8', 442, 1, 3, 1046453) But it was of their own volition that they earlier did not do so.
('8', 442, 1, 4, 1046519) Since it is the Government which now wants to stop the practice, it is imperative that we protest.
('8', 442, 1, 5, 1046618) A petition signed by all the Hindus should be submitted to the Government.
('8', 442, 1, 6, 1046693) If it is signed by thousands of persons, there is hope of its being looked into.
('8', 442, 1, 7, 1046774) Muslims, Christians, Parsis can all help in this matter.
('8', 442, 1, 8, 1046831) Today one of our religions is under attack; tomorrow it may be the turn of another.
('8', 442, 1, 9, 1046915) We hope therefore that not only will the Hin dus take up this issue, but also that the other communities will help.

('8', 442, 3, 12, 1047097) The murder of Mr. Banu and his wife in Sydenham bears out our observations made some time ago.
('8', 442, 3, 13, 1047192) 1 We do not yet know the motive for the murder.
('8', 442, 3, 14, 1047240) It is [of course] necessary to write to the Government regarding police protection in Sydenham and other towns.
('8', 442, 3, 15, 1047352) But the real remedy lies in our own hands.
('8', 442, 3, 16, 1047395) Moreover, the difficulties which were experienced in having Mr. Banus body buried should be a matter of shame to the Government.
('8', 442, 3, 17, 1047524) It was not right that the body was left unburied for two days.
('8', 442, 3, 18, 1047587) It is believed that officials were to blame for this.
('8', 442, 3, 19, 1047641) The Congress did well in writing to the Government about this as well.
('8', 442, 3, 20, 1047712) It is necessary that the Congress should write forcefully to the Government on these matters.

('8', 442, 5, 23, 1047889) Fruiterers of Natal who carry on trade with the Transvaal must be careful when sending fruit such as nachis 2 to the Colony.
('8', 442, 5, 24, 1048014) If more than five per cent of the fruit in a crate has dark spots, the whole crate is rejected by the Transvaal authorities and the entire consignment condemned.
('8', 442, 5, 25, 1048176) The best way is to pack the fruit after careful examina tion.
('8', 442, 5, 26, 1048238) If this is not done, considerable loss may result.

('8', 443, 4, 9, 1048996) The caption in English under the drawing explains that the snake charmer is playing hard on his flute to charm the cobra.

('8', 443, 7, 15, 1049320) I am not framing any further questions at all.
('8', 443, 7, 16, 1049367) After I left you, I saw Mr. Hosken, andMr. Hosken, too, has promised to see General Smuts, because in a letter addressed to Mr. Hosken it is stated that those who have ta[ken] 2 out voluntary registration certificates will not have their certificates legalized under the Act.
('8', 443, 7, 17, 1049643) This letter is written in General Smuts own handwriting, so that there can be no mistake about it.

('8', 444, 9, 15, 1051070) DEAR MR. CARTWRIGHT, This is what I have understood from the telephonic conversation you had with me this morning.
('8', 444, 9, 16, 1051185) General Smuts is willing to recognize the validity of Dutch 3 registration certificates, provided that proof substantiate the bona is otherwise given to substantiate the bona fide ownership of such certificates, and that this proof should, if possible, be European proof.
('8', 444, 9, 17, 1051457) General Smuts thinks that there may be 15,000 registration certificates.
('8', 444, 9, 18, 1051530) These cannot be accepted on mere produc

('8', 445, 0, 1, 1051676) 446 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 445, 1, 2, 1051718) With reference to this matter, I have always contended that the burden of proving ownership should rest upon the person producing the certificate.
('8', 445, 1, 3, 1051865) Proof will have to be given to the satisfaction of a court of law, unless the Registrar is satisfied therewith.
('8', 445, 1, 4, 1051977) The same thing will apply to those who do not hold registration certificates, but are bona fide refugees of standing.
('8', 445, 1, 5, 1052095) It is impossible to vouch for Euro pean proof in each case.
('8', 445, 1, 6, 1052155) I am positive that there are not 15,000 1 registration certificates out.
('8', 445, 1, 7, 1052228) If there were, it will be open to General Smuts to bring forward new legislation to stop any such influx.
('8', 445, 1, 8, 1052334) What with the refugees apart from certificate holders and certificate holders them selves, I do not think that, at the outside, there can possibly be more than a thousand immigrants.
('8', 445, 1, 9, 1052517) Proof of the pudding will be in the eating.
('8', 445, 1, 10, 1052561) I have suggested that a limited period be fixed within which all such applications should be made; so that there need be no difficulty at all about this.
('8', 445, 1, 11, 1052715) The right of appeal is restricted to the Magistrates court in connection With any such men.
('8', 445, 1, 12, 1052807) 2 I had the conversation with General Smuts.
('8', 445, 1, 13, 1052852) 3 same treatment.
('8', 445, 1, 14, 1052870) 4 Hindus, Mahomedans Christians.
('8', 445, 1, 15, 1052903) 5 Now I come to the question.
('8', 445, 1, 16, 1052933) 6 point, so far as I can see it, from the Governments standpoint, of utter insignificance, from an Indian standpoint, of paramount importance.
('8', 445, 1, 17, 1053076) I do not quarrel with any legis lation that General Smuts may choose to bring, but I do emphatically protest against Indians being made consenting parties to any such legislation.
('8', 445, 1, 18, 1053256) They must have the right to protest and to carry on any agitation they choose to, in connection with it.
('8', 445, 1, 19, 1053361) If he is willing to con cede, as I understood this morning he was, the points referred to above, then the Immigrants Restriction Amendment Bill shown to me may be brought with the necessary alterations, and he may, if he cho oses, insert a clause prohibiting the immigration of educated Asiatics.
('8', 445, 1, 20, 1053658) The result will be a petition to Parliament against that clause, a petition to the Imperial Government, and, if I can carry my countrymen with me, undoubtedly passive resistance.
('8', 445, 1, 21, 1053837) Whether I can carry them with me or not I am not in a position yet to tell you definitely.
('8', 445, 1, 22, 1053928) My endeavour is undoubtedly, as it must be, to persuade them to do so.
('8', 445, 1, 23, 1053999) I told you through the telephone that I found Mr. Essop Mia, last night, to be weak on the question.
('8', 445, 1, 24, 1054100) He thought that, if the three points were yielded, we should be satisfied.
('8', 445, 1, 25, 1054175) I ventured to differ from him.

('8', 446, 1, 3, 1054514) He now stands aghast at his opinion, and he thinks that the handful of Indians in the Transvaal will merit the curse of the whole of India, if they consented to the educational disqualifications.
('8', 446, 1, 4, 1054710) I repeat again: it is the consent that [is] all, and not independent legislation that General Smuts may choose to bring.
('8', 446, 1, 5, 1054831) He must not only [sic] before us and say.
('8', 446, 1, 6, 1054873) 1 repealing the Act, that was placed before me, he will notice my query also against this section; but I am quite satisfied that appeal to the Supreme Court should be on questions of law and not on questions of fact.
('8', 446, 1, 7, 1055090) The appeal, however, that I have asked for is from Mr. Chamneys decision, in connection with pending applications.
('8', 446, 1, 8, 1055205) That was what General Smuts refused at the interview.
('8', 446, 1, 9, 1055259) I take it that now he is willing to concede the right.
('8', 446, 1, 10, 1055314) The matter is, to my mind, self evident.
('8', 446, 1, 11, 1055355) General Smuts mentioned that I had received from Maho medans 2 apiece per voluntary registration certificate.
('8', 446, 1, 12, 1055465) This I stigma tized as a damnable lie, and I repeat it.
('8', 446, 1, 13, 1055521) It has been propagated, eviden tly, by some enemy of the Indian community.
('8', 446, 1, 14, 1055596) What I have done is to charge a fee of two guineas for legal work done for voluntary regis tration ap plications, whether I made them on behalf of Hindus or Mahomedans.
('8', 446, 1, 15, 1055765) I asked the book keeper to give me the number of such applications made by me, and it does not exceed 235. These applica tions involve more than two guineas worth of work.
('8', 446, 1, 16, 1055937) I had to examine the case of each individual applicant, then to fill in the form, to send a clerk with the man, and, in many cases to carry on voluminous corres pondence with the Registration Office.
('8', 446, 1, 17, 1056137) This was work strictly within my province, and I have worked like any other Attorney.
('8', 446, 1, 18, 1056223) But, as I held the office of Secretary of the British Indian Association also, I informed Mr. Chamney that, if individual Indians came to me and wanted me to prosecute their claims before him, I charged a fee of two guineas, and asked him to convey that information to General Smuts also.
('8', 446, 1, 19, 1056512) This, you will see, is totally different from his statement.
('8', 446, 1, 20, 1056573) 2 that I have charged 2 from every Mahomedan for a voluntary registration certificate.
('8', 446, 1, 21, 1056660) 3 application question, passive resistance may prove a farce [sic] can only speak for myself and say that I should deserve severest condemnation even from General Smuts and all my European friends, if I, a barrister having received a liberal education, were to say that my fellow barristers should not enter the Transvaal or any other Colony, because they were Indians.

('8', 447, 1, 6, 1057519) I have done nothing else than discussed this question with most prominent Asiatics, and I can conclude by hoping that General Smuts will show sufficient statesmanship by not making this matter a stumbling block.

('8', 447, 4, 18, 1058463) [JOHANNESBURG,] July 16, 1908 THE EDITOR THE STAR
('8', 447, 5, 19, 1058513) SIR, You published in your notes yesterday the statement that a settlement of the Asiatic question is probable, and you state very properly that the point (that is, of education) would not appear to be essential to the general principles involved, as educated Indians could not, outside of their own community, make an adequate pittance.
('8', 447, 5, 20, 1058851) I hope that the news published by you is correct.
('8', 447, 6, 21, 1058901) 1 Some words missing 2 This appeared in Indian Opinion, 25 7 1908, under the title Mr. Essop Mias Explanation.
('8', 448, 0, 1, 1059012) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 449
('8', 448, 1, 2, 1059057) What, however, I understand to be the situation is that, whilst the Government are willing now to repeal the Act and recognize the rights of Asiatics domiciled in the Colony before the war, they insist upon British Indians accepting total prohibition of the entry of Indians, no matter what educational attainments they may possess.
('8', 448, 1, 3, 1059390) This is not in the law today, as Mr. Sorabjis case has made clear.
('8', 448, 1, 4, 1059457) In asking us, therefore, to accept the above disqualification, the Government ask us to commit communal suicide.
('8', 448, 1, 5, 1059570) If the resident Asiatic population is to be fully protected, and is to be allowed to remain in the country in a becoming manner, it must be apparent to every Colonist that they will need the assistance and guidance of their educated brethren.
('8', 448, 1, 6, 1059813) By education I do not mean a mere knowledge of the elements of the English or any other European language, but I mean a very high degree of culture.
('8', 448, 1, 7, 1059962) Does anyone suppose that Indians in the Colony, the majority of whom are traders, can live with any degree of comfort, if they have not amongst them such men as I have described above ?
('8', 448, 1, 8, 1060148) There is not a British Colony in the world, with a resident Asiatic population, which has legislation of the kind to which our consent is now required as a condition precedent to the granting of simple jus tice to pre war Indians.
('8', 448, 1, 9, 1060379) If the Government think that they can carry their drastic policy of exclusion, let them do so and let them at the same time recognize the other rights.
('8', 448, 1, 10, 1060531) If justice is on our side on the question of education, and if we have sufficient strength in us, we will win.
('8', 448, 1, 11, 1060642) But, as the position stands at present, it seems to me that I and other Indians have armed ourselves with voluntary registration certificates and also yearly licences, and have placed ourselves in a better position than our other countrymen who have an equal right with us to live and trade in this Colony; and, as their position is in jeopardy, in view of the entire disregard by General Smuts of the solemn obligations undertaken by him, I feel I have erred in having been the first to take out my voluntary registration certificate and my annual licence.
('8', 448, 1, 12, 1061200) I, as well as other British Indians, who have taken a prominent part hitherto in the passive resistance campaign and since the compromise, have helped the Government to the best of our ability, have therefore decided, by way of protest and penance, ourselves to become hawkers and give ourselves the privilege of hawking without a licence.
('8', 448, 1, 13, 1061540) If, therefore, the people of Johannesburg see strange Indian faces with baskets of fruit and vegetables, they should understand that they have become unlicensed hawkers by way of protest against injustice.
('8', 448, 1, 14, 1061746) In taking this step with deliberation, my compatriots have no desire willingly to defy the laws of the land.
('8', 448, 1, 15, 1061855) It is because we have so great a respect for the laws of the country in which
('8', 449, 0, 1, 1061933) 450 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 449, 1, 2, 1061975) we live that we have undertaken to break certain statutes, which are miscalled laws, but which can be more properly described as engines of tyranny.
('8', 449, 1, 3, 1062124) It is nobodys duty to submit to tyranny.
('8', 449, 1, 4, 1062165) The step that has now been taken is, therefore, I hold, a perfectly lawful and just one.

('8', 449, 3, 7, 1062346) 255. WHAT WAS, AND IS, THE CAMPAIGN ABOUT?
('8', 449, 4, 8, 1062389) The Transvaal campaign is likely to teach the Indians a great many lessons.
('8', 449, 4, 9, 1062465) It did not, and does not, aim merely at securing the repeal of the Act.
('8', 449, 4, 10, 1062537) It is possible to get the Act repealed.
('8', 449, 4, 11, 1062577) But there exist loopholes which present difficulties, so that though General Smuts is prepared to repeal the Act we are unable to give our consent.
('8', 449, 4, 12, 1062725) The movement was never directed against finger impressions as such.
('8', 449, 4, 13, 1062793) 1 Now, when they demand the thumb impression on [traders]licences, under the law, the community refuses to give them.
('8', 449, 4, 14, 1062911) It says to the Government: We will not agree to anything under compulsion. It would not agree even to names being signed on the applications for licences under the obnoxious Act.
('8', 449, 4, 15, 1063090) What, then, does disobedience of the obnoxious law mean?
('8', 449, 4, 16, 1063147) That is exactly what needs to be understood.
('8', 449, 4, 17, 1063192) If the law is repealed and replaced by another another even worse, we shall have gained nothing.
('8', 449, 4, 18, 1063289) The point is that the obnoxious law puts us in fetters, and they must be broken.
('8', 449, 4, 19, 1063370) It fetters us because if we submit to it, we must endure all manner of harassment by the Government.
('8', 449, 4, 20, 1063471) How can we put up with that?
('8', 449, 4, 21, 1063500) Once the fetters are broken, the Government will cease enacting unwanted laws affecting us, and will consult us beforehand.
('8', 449, 4, 22, 1063624) Does it bind itself so to consult us?
('8', 449, 4, 23, 1063662) Both yes and no.
('8', 449, 4, 24, 1063679) It will undertake to consult us it has done so beforeso long as we are prepared to fight against it with the sword of satyagraha.
('8', 449, 4, 25, 1063809) It will cease to remain so bound the moment we abandon satyagraha.
('8', 449, 4, 26, 1063876) The Government is prepared to safeguard the rights of those who hold the 3 registers.
('8', 449, 4, 27, 1063962) It also offers the right of appeal to the Supreme Court.
('8', 449, 4, 28, 1064019) But it will not allow educated Indians to enter.
('8', 449, 4, 29, 1064068) What does this

('8', 450, 0, 1, 1064129) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 451
('8', 450, 1, 2, 1064174) Many people imagine that the term educated Indians denotes clerks.
('8', 450, 1, 3, 1064241) This is a mistake.
('8', 450, 1, 4, 1064260) Whether or not clerks are able to come in is another question.
('8', 450, 1, 5, 1064323) But forbidding the entry of lawyers, physicians, etc., is an intolerable situation.
('8', 450, 1, 6, 1064407) The true significance of all this is that the authorities first want to please the Indians by repealing the Act and then to finish them off.
('8', 450, 1, 7, 1064548) A lawyer or a physician is not worth more than a businessman or a farmer.
('8', 450, 1, 8, 1064622) But a trader is concerned with trade.
('8', 450, 1, 9, 1064660) A lawyers duty is to fight and help others fight.
('8', 450, 1, 10, 1064710) There is no country in the world where the people have progressed without lawyers or physicians.
('8', 450, 1, 11, 1064807) Businessmen, landlords and farmers are like the torso, but lawyers and other [professional men] are like the arms of the community.
('8', 450, 1, 12, 1064939) The torso is the main thing.
('8', 450, 1, 13, 1064968) But it will be useless without the arms.
('8', 450, 1, 14, 1065009) The question of educated Indians, therefore, deserves serious attention.
('8', 450, 1, 15, 1065082) It can be asserted that the campaign that is to follow [will be launched] only on their account.
('8', 450, 1, 16, 1065179) That is so, indeed.
('8', 450, 1, 17, 1065199) How can the community ever assure the Government that it will give up the fight if educated Indians are kept out?
('8', 450, 1, 18, 1065313) If the community made such a mistake, it would invite scorn from India.
('8', 450, 1, 19, 1065385) If, on the other hand, it fights out that issue, it will win the admiration of all Indians.
('8', 450, 1, 20, 1065477) This struggle is thus not aimed merely at securing the repeal of the Act.
('8', 450, 1, 21, 1065551) It is a conflict between the whites and the Coloured persons.
('8', 450, 1, 22, 1065613) The whites want to ride roughshod over us, to keep us down always as slaves.
('8', 450, 1, 23, 1065690) We want to be their equals.
('8', 450, 1, 24, 1065718) This is the significance of the campaign and satyagraha will prove equal to its name only when every Indian has it impressed deep in his mind.
('8', 450, 1, 25, 1065861) The sword of satyagraha is not to be used for cutting dung cakes which is what the domiciliary rights of a handful of Transvaal Indians really are, but to pierce the violent, rock like hatred in the hearts of the whites.
('8', 450, 1, 26, 1066082) This is a task which cannot be achieved Even if the Transvaal throws up a few brave Indians they will fulfil this task and cover themselves with undying glory.

('8', 450, 3, 29, 1066309) EBB AND FLOW
('8', 450, 4, 30, 1066322) The fortunes of movement are sometimes at high tide; at other they ebb.
('8', 450, 4, 31, 1066394) Good news alternates with bad.
('8', 450, 4, 32, 1066425) One moment we hear of an impending settlement the next that nothing will happen after all.
('8', 451, 0, 1, 1066516) 452 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 451, 1, 2, 1066558) Friday last, it was reported that the government had decided to enforce the obnoxious law.
('8', 451, 1, 3, 1066649) Mr. Gandhi therefore wrote the following letter 1 to the Leader.
('8', 451, 1, 4, 1066714) Mr. Chamney notice suggests that the Government wants to bring the voluntary registrants also within the scope of the law.
('8', 451, 1, 5, 1066837) If that is done, all the conditions of the compromise will be violated.
('8', 451, 1, 6, 1066909) Both the written agreement and the oral understanding will be undone.
('8', 451, 1, 7, 1066979) Alarmed at the prospect, Mr. Cartwright and Mr. Hosken have had an interview with General Smuts.
('8', 451, 1, 8, 1067076) It is gathered from what transpired at the interview that the rights of those who hold the 3 [Dutch registration certificates] and the other refugees 2 can be saved.
('8', 451, 1, 9, 1067242) The right of appeal may also be allowed, but the rights of educated persons cannot be saved.
('8', 451, 1, 10, 1067335) The obnoxious Act will not apply to volun tary registrants.
('8', 451, 1, 11, 1067395) This is what has been reported.
('8', 451, 1, 12, 1067427) But one need not base any hopes on this report.
('8', 451, 1, 13, 1067475) All we can depend on ultimately is our own strength.
('8', 451, 1, 14, 1067528) The [Transvaal] Leader of Monday reported that, since the law was to be enforced, the municipalities had been asked to send to the Colonial Secretary the names of traders or hawkers who were do ing business without licences, so that these persons might be pro secuted.
('8', 451, 1, 15, 1067797) This threw the Indians into a panic and they swarmed to the municipal office like locusts.
('8', 451, 1, 16, 1067888) Thumb impressions were asked for, and they gave these readily.
('8', 451, 1, 17, 1067951) They felt so exultant when they received the licences that one would have thought they had achieved something really remarkable.
('8', 451, 1, 18, 1068080) Their pledge not to submit to the Act was comple tely forgotten.
('8', 451, 1, 19, 1068145) For the thumb impressions were given under the Act.
('8', 451, 1, 20, 1068197) In reply to arguments by the pickets at the gate they said: Gandhi made the people give 18 digit impressions; what is wrong with our giving two thumb impressions,? For there were now 16 impressions less!
('8', 451, 1, 21, 1068401) Many persons reasoned with these men, but to no avail.
('8', 451, 1, 22, 1068456) Thus were [at once] exemplified the ignorance about and the beauty of sat yagraha.
('8', 451, 1, 23, 1068539) Ignorance, because people compared the giving of 18 digit impressions voluntarily with the giving of two thumb impressions [compulsorily] under the law.
('8', 451, 1, 24, 1068692) Beauty, because satyagraha can be waged continuously.
('8', 451, 1, 25, 1068746) That some persons have abandoned it should not come in the way of the others who have not forsaken it.
('8', 451, 1, 26, 1068849) Though many Indians have given their thumb impressions, there are many others who are unyielding.
('8', 451, 1, 27, 1068947) They know that it is wrong to give thumb imp

('8', 452, 1, 2, 1069321) ressions.
('8', 452, 1, 3, 1069331) Even [ones] signature should not be given under the law.
('8', 452, 1, 4, 1069388) In fact, many persons, having gone to the municipality, returned [without giving thumb impressions].
('8', 452, 1, 5, 1069489) A number of them continue boldly to trade without licences, holding themselves in readiness for gaol [life].
('8', 452, 1, 6, 1069598) Thus those who are now ready to go to gaol are true satyagrahis for it is in the interests of others that they are offering satyagraha.
('8', 452, 1, 7, 1069734) And who are these others?
('8', 452, 1, 8, 1069760) (1) Those who are in possession of 3 registers; (2) refugees; (3) those whose applications Chamney is still holding up; and (4) educated Indians.
('8', 452, 2, 9, 1069906) EDUCATED INDIANS
('8', 452, 3, 10, 1069923) The fight now is really on behalf of the educated Indians.
('8', 452, 3, 11, 1069982) And it is a just cause to fight for.
('8', 452, 3, 12, 1070019) It is General Smuts intention to reduce the Indians to slavery by keeping out the educated among them.
('8', 452, 3, 13, 1070122) How can this be allowed?
('8', 452, 3, 14, 1070147) How can the Indian community agree to this wrongful denial of the rights of educated [Asiatics to enter the Colony]?
('8', 452, 3, 15, 1070264) Everyone assents to this argument and admits that it wouldbe a dishonour for the Indians to do so.
('8', 452, 3, 16, 1070363) The proposed movement can be carried on even if Indians do not join it in their thousands.
('8', 452, 3, 17, 1070454) If 500 Indians of true mettle, prepared for the worst, take the field, Indian honour will be vindicated.
('8', 452, 3, 18, 1070559) There was a suggestion that Mr. Jinnah, Bar at Law, be invited to join [the campaign].
('8', 452, 3, 19, 1070646) Should the Indian community now agree [to the Act], as he may not be allowed to come?
('8', 452, 3, 20, 1070732) Mr. Dawad Mahomeds son is in England for his studies.
('8', 452, 3, 21, 1070786) Should he not be able to return after completing them?
('8', 452, 3, 22, 1070841) Must it only be through Mr. Smuts grace that he should be able to come back?
('8', 452, 3, 23, 1070918) Mr. Joseph Royeppen is due to return in a few days.
('8', 452, 3, 24, 1070970) He was born in South Africa but he cannot come in either.
('8', 452, 3, 25, 1071028) How can the Indian community countenance all this?
('8', 452, 3, 26, 1071079) It should be borne in mind that it is being asked to assent to all these restrictions.
('8', 452, 3, 27, 1071166) It would be a different matter if they were to pass a law to this effect on their own.
('8', 452, 3, 28, 1071253) We could then fight against it, if possible.
('8', 452, 3, 29, 1071298) But what Indian can say that he will not mind, that he is agreeable to, the enactment of such a law?
('8', 452, 4, 30, 1071399) INDIANS ENEMIES
('8', 452, 5, 31, 1071415) But why is it that such difficulties arise constantly?
('8', 452, 5, 32, 1071470) The answer is that there are certain Indians who have become enemies of the community.
('8', 452, 5, 33, 1071557) They tell General Smuts that the Indian community has no fight left in it, that everyone will submit to the Act, that the talk of burning [The registers] is mere bragging, that everyone will take out licences and give thumb impressions, that it is Mr. Gandhi and a few other Indians who are the cause of the mischief, that the others have
('8', 453, 0, 1, 1071896) 454 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 453, 1, 2, 1071938) no grievances.
('8', 453, 1, 3, 1071953) These reports are welcome to General Smuts; he believes them, with the result that Indians suffer.
('8', 453, 1, 4, 1072052) If all the Indians are in fact prepared to submit to the Act, it is only right that the law should apply to them.
('8', 453, 1, 5, 1072166) But I believe that there are only a few Indians who accept the Act.
('8', 453, 1, 6, 1072234) Letters continue to come in from many towns, such as Barberton, Christiana, Volksrust, Vereeniging, Nylstroom, Heidelberg, Germiston, to say that Indians are steadfast and will fight for these rights.
('8', 453, 1, 7, 1072435) There are many Indians in these towns who have not taken out licences and do not mean to.
('8', 453, 1, 8, 1072525) So long as this spirit persists, Indians will not suffer defeat.
('8', 453, 1, 9, 1072590) What is reported to General Smuts, and by whom, will make no difference.
('8', 453, 2, 10, 1072663) SORABJI
('8', 453, 3, 11, 1072671) Sorabji has been wonderful.
('8', 453, 3, 12, 1072699) He has come all the way from Charlestown just to go to gaol.
('8', 453, 3, 13, 1072760) By the time people have a copy of this paper he may already have been installed in gaol.
('8', 453, 3, 14, 1072849) Let every Indian understand that, after sending him to gaol, the Indian community should not forgo any of the rights we have discussed above.
('8', 453, 4, 15, 1072991) MASS MEETING
('8', 453, 5, 16, 1073004) A mass meeting will be held on Sunday.
('8', 453, 5, 17, 1073043) Registers will not be burnt at this meeting, not yet.
('8', 453, 5, 18, 1073097) Many rumours are current, so that the wisest course will be to wait till General Smuts publishes his draft Bill and then to burn the registers, and meanwhile to prepare for any eventuality.
('8', 453, 5, 19, 1073287) There is no reason to fear that he will play foul if we wait.
('8', 453, 5, 20, 1073349) That is not how deceit is practised.
('8', 453, 5, 21, 1073386) For double crossing can have no effect on a satyagrahi, as he does not depend on others in his fight.
('8', 453, 5, 22, 1073488) After the draft Bill is published, we can make a bonfire of the certificates and warm ourselves by it.
('8', 453, 5, 23, 1073591) The Bill has first to appear in the Gazette be discussed in Parliament and receive Royal assent in England before it can come into force.
('8', 453, 5, 24, 1073729) In the meantime, we can try and cope with the situation.
('8', 453, 5, 25, 1073786) But all those Indians who are firm in their determination [to resist the Act] had better send in their registers immediately to the British Indian Association.
('8', 453, 6, 26, 1073946) LACK OF FUNDS
('8', 453, 7, 27, 1073960) This movement does not require much money.
('8', 453, 7, 28, 1074003) But a small sum will certainly be necessary.
('8', 453, 7, 29, 1074048) The Associations reserves have been badly.
('8', 453, 7, 30, 1074091) depleted, with the result that cables cannot be sent to England or India as often as desired.
('8', 453, 7, 31, 1074185) It is, therefore, necessary for every Committee and every Indian to send in as much money as possible.
('8', 453, 7, 32, 1074288) Barberton Indians have sent letters and telegrams of encouragement
('8', 454, 0, 1, 1074355) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 455
('8', 454, 1, 2, 1074400) and also remitted 10 by draft.
('8', 454, 2, 3, 1074431) ESSOP MIA AS HAWKER
('8', 454, 3, 4, 1074451) On Tuesday evening, Mr. Essop Mia called a meeting, asking Mr. Gandhi to stay away.
('8', 454, 3, 5, 1074535) It was attended by nearly 200 Indians.
('8', 454, 3, 6, 1074574) The meeting decided most emphatically that Indians should never agree to the exclusion of educated Indians from the Transvaal.
('8', 454, 3, 7, 1074701) Mr. Essop Mia applied for a hawkers licence to give a stimulus to the movement and to forgo the protection afforded him by his voluntary registration cer tificate and trade licence.
('8', 454, 3, 8, 1074883) Since he refused to give thumb impressions, he was not issued the licence he had asked for.
('8', 454, 3, 9, 1074975) Mr. Essop Mia will now make his rounds as a hawker without a licence and visit the houses of prominent whites to sell them fruit.
('8', 454, 3, 10, 1075105) He will carry a small basket with him.
('8', 454, 3, 11, 1075144) He thus wants to challenge the Government to arrest him.
('8', 454, 3, 12, 1075201) His spirit has infected numerous other Indians.
('8', 454, 3, 13, 1075249) The Chairman of the Hamidia Islamic Society and other Indian leaders will follow suit.
('8', 454, 3, 14, 1075336) Some educated Indians have also decided to do the same.
('8', 454, 3, 15, 1075392) If the spirit is maintained, the fight will have an early end.
('8', 454, 3, 16, 1075455) A community that has such brave men will never have to give in.
('8', 454, 3, 17, 1075519) A new spirit is abroad in the community, and the great significance of the movement is being realized in increasing measure.
('8', 454, 4, 18, 1075644) PICKETS READY AGAIN
('8', 454, 5, 19, 1075664) The following Indians have volunteered to picket and dissuade people from going to the municipality to take out licences after giving their thumb impressions: Messrs Bhaiji Ebrahim, Ali Ismail, Mulji G. Patel, Ali Umar, Ranchhod Mitha, Bagas Bapu and others.

('8', 454, 8, 23, 1076076) 257. SARVODAYA [ IX]
('8', 454, 9, 24, 1076097) WHAT IS JUST?
('8', 454, 10, 25, 1076111) We saw in the three preceding chapters that the generally accept ed principles of economics are invalid.
('8', 454, 10, 26, 1076216) If acted upon, they will make individuals and nations unhappy.
('8', 454, 10, 27, 1076279) The poor will become poorer and the rich richer; neither will be any the happier for it.
('8', 454, 10, 28, 1076368) Economists do not take mens conduct into account but
('8', 455, 0, 1, 1076421) 456 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 455, 1, 2, 1076463) estimate prosperity from the amount of wealth accumulated and so conclude that the happiness of nations depends upon their wealth alone.
('8', 455, 1, 3, 1076600) Hence they advocate greater accumulation of wealth through more and more work in factories.
('8', 455, 1, 4, 1076692) In England and elsewhere factories have multiplied because of the spread of these ideas.
('8', 455, 1, 5, 1076781) Large numbers of men leave their farms and concentrate in cities.
('8', 455, 1, 6, 1076847) They give up the pure and fresh air of the countryside and feel happy breathing the foul air of factories.
('8', 455, 1, 7, 1076954) As a result, the nation grows weaker, and avarice and immorality increase, and if someone suggests measures for eradicating vice, the so called wise men argue that vice cannot be eliminated, that the ignorant cannot be educated all at once and that it is best to let things alone.
('8', 455, 1, 8, 1077235) While advancing this argument, they forget that it is the rich who are responsible for the immorality of the poor.
('8', 455, 1, 9, 1077350) The wretched workers slave for them day and night so that they may be kept supplied with their luxuries.
('8', 455, 1, 10, 1077455) They have not a moment to themselves for self improvement.
('8', 455, 1, 11, 1077514) Thinking about the rich, they also want to be rich.
('8', 455, 1, 12, 1077566) When they fail in this, they become angry and resentful.
('8', 455, 1, 13, 1077623) They then forget themselves [in their anger], and having failed to gather wealth by honest means, turn in desperation to fraud.
('8', 455, 1, 14, 1077751) Both wealth and labour are thus wasted, else they are utilized for promoting fraud.
('8', 455, 1, 15, 1077835) Labour, in the real sense of the term, is that which produces use ful articles.
('8', 455, 1, 16, 1077915) Useful articles are those which support human life.
('8', 455, 1, 17, 1077967) Suppo rting human life means provision of food, clothing, etc., so as to enable men to live a moral life and to do good while they live.
('8', 455, 1, 18, 1078104) For this purpose, large scale industrial undertakings would appear to be use less.
('8', 455, 1, 19, 1078187) To seek to acquire wealth by establishing big factories is likely to lead to sin.
('8', 455, 1, 20, 1078269) Many people amass wealth but few make good use of it.
('8', 455, 1, 21, 1078323) If the making of money is likely to lead a nation to its destruction, that money is useless.
('8', 455, 1, 22, 1078416) On the contrary, present day capitalists are respon sible for widespread and unjust wars.
('8', 455, 1, 23, 1078506) Most of the wars of our times spring from greed for money.
('8', 455, 1, 24, 1078565) We hear people say that it is impossible to educate others so as to improve them, and the best course would be to live as well as one could and accumulate wealth.
('8', 455, 1, 25, 1078728) Those he hold these views show little concern for ethical principles.
('8', 455, 1, 26, 1078798) For the person who values ethical prin ciples and does not yield to avarice has a disciplined mind; he does not tray from the right path, and influences others merely by his exa mple.
('8', 455, 1, 27, 1078982) If the individuals who constitute a nation do not observe moral principles of conduct how can the nation become moral?
('8', 455, 1, 28, 1079101) If we behave as we choose and then point the accusing finger at an errant neigh bour, how can the result [of our actions] be good?
('8', 455, 1, 29, 1079232) We thus see that money no more than a means which may make

('8', 456, 1, 2, 1079336) for happiness or misery.
('8', 456, 1, 3, 1079361) In the hands of a good man, it can be used for cultivating land and raising crops.
('8', 456, 1, 4, 1079444) Cultivators will find conten tment in innocent labour and the nation will be happy.
('8', 456, 1, 5, 1079528) In the hands of bad men, it is used for the production, say, of gun powder and brin ging utter ruin on the people.
('8', 456, 1, 6, 1079643) Both those who manufacture gun powder and those who fall victims to it suffer in consequence.
('8', 456, 1, 7, 1079737) We thus see that there is no wealth besides life.
('8', 456, 1, 8, 1079787) That nation is wealthy Which is moral.
('8', 456, 1, 9, 1079826) This not the time for self indulgence.
('8', 456, 1, 10, 1079865) Everyone must work according to his ability.
('8', 456, 1, 11, 1079910) As we saw in the illustrations earlier, if one man remains idle another has to labour twice as hard.
('8', 456, 1, 12, 1080011) 1 This is at the root of the starvation prevalent in England.
('8', 456, 1, 13, 1080073) There are men who do little useful work themselves because of the wealth that has accumu lated in their hands, and so force others to labour for them.
('8', 456, 1, 14, 1080224) This kind of labour, being unproductive, is not beneficial to the worker.
('8', 456, 1, 15, 1080298) In con sequence, the income suffers diminution.
('8', 456, 1, 16, 1080346) Though all men appear to be employed, we find on closer scrutiny that a large number are idle perforce.
('8', 456, 1, 17, 1080450) Moreover, envy is aroused, discontent takes root and, in the end, the rich and the poor, the employer and the workman violate the bounds of decency [in their mutual relations].
('8', 456, 1, 18, 1080627) As the cat and the mouse are always at variance with each other, so the rich and the poor, the employer and the workman become hostile to one another, and man, ceasing to be man, is reduced to the level of beasts.
('8', 456, 2, 19, 1080841) CONCLUSION
('8', 456, 3, 20, 1080852) Our summary of the great Ruskins book is now concluded.
('8', 456, 3, 21, 1080908) Though some may have been bored by it, we advise those who have read the articles once to read them again.
('8', 456, 3, 22, 1081015) It will be too much to expect that all the readers of Indian Opinion will ponder over them and act on them.
('8', 456, 3, 23, 1081123) But even if a law readers make a careful study of the sum mary and grasp the central idea, we shall deem our labour to have been amply rewarded.
('8', 456, 3, 24, 1081268) Even if that does not happen, the reward [of labour], as Ruskin says in the last chapter, consists in having done ones duty and that should satisfy one.
('8', 456, 3, 25, 1081421) What Ruskin wrote for his countrymen, the British, is a thousand times more applicable to Indians.
('8', 456, 3, 26, 1081520) New ideas are spreading in India.
('8', 456, 3, 27, 1081554) The advent of a new spirit among the young who have received western education is of course to be welcomed.
('8', 456, 3, 28, 1081662) But the outcome will be beneficial only if that spirit is canalized properly; if it is not, it is bound to be harmful.
('8', 456, 3, 29, 1081781) From one side we hear the cry for swarajya; from another, for the quick accumulation of wealth by setting up factories like those in Britain.

('8', 457, 0, 1, 1081956) 458 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 457, 1, 2, 1081998) Our people hardly understand what swarajya means.
('8', 457, 1, 3, 1082048) Natal enjoys swarajya, but we would say that, if we were to imitate Natal, swarajya would be no better than hell.
('8', 457, 1, 4, 1082162) [The Natal whites] tyrannize over the Kaffirs, hound out the Indians, and in their blindness give free rein to selfishness.
('8', 457, 1, 5, 1082286) If, by chance, Kaffirs and Indians were to leave Natal, they would destroy themselves in a civil war.
('8', 457, 1, 6, 1082388) Shall we, then, hanker after the kind of swarajya which obtains in the Transvaal?
('8', 457, 1, 7, 1082470) General Smuts is one of their leading figures.
('8', 457, 1, 8, 1082517) He does not keep any promise, oral or written.
('8', 457, 1, 9, 1082564) He says one thing, does another.
('8', 457, 1, 10, 1082597) The British are disgusted with him.
('8', 457, 1, 11, 1082633) Under the guise of effecting economy, he has deprived British soldiers of livelihood and has been replacing them with Dutchmen.
('8', 457, 1, 12, 1082761) We do not believe that in the long run this will make even the Dutch happy.
('8', 457, 1, 13, 1082837) Those who serve only their own interests will be ready to rob their own people after they have done with robbing others.
('8', 457, 1, 14, 1082958) If we observe happenings all over the world, we shall be able to see that what people call swarajya is not enough [to secure] the nations prosperity and happiness.
('8', 457, 1, 15, 1083122) We can perceive this by means of a simple example.
('8', 457, 1, 16, 1083173) All of us can visualize what would happen if a band of robbers were to enjoy swarajya.
('8', 457, 1, 17, 1083260) In the long run they would be happy only if they were placed under the control of men who were not themselves robbers.
('8', 457, 1, 18, 1083379) America, France and England are all great States.
('8', 457, 1, 19, 1083429) But there is no reason to think that they are really happy.
('8', 457, 1, 20, 1083489) Real swarajya consists in restraint.
('8', 457, 1, 21, 1083526) He alone is capable of this who leads a moral life, does not cheat anyone, does not forsake truth and does his duty to his parents, his wife, his children, his servant and his neighbour.
('8', 457, 1, 22, 1083713) Such a man will enjoy swarajya wherever he may happen to live.
('8', 457, 1, 23, 1083776) A nation that has many such men always enjoys swarajya.
('8', 457, 1, 24, 1083832) It is wrong normally for one nation to rule over another.
('8', 457, 1, 25, 1083890) British rule in India is an evil but we need not believe that any very great advantage would accrue to the Indians if the British were to leave India.
('8', 457, 1, 26, 1084041) The reason why they rule over us is to be found in ourselves; that reason is our disunity, our immorality and our ignorance.
('8', 457, 2, 27, 1084166) If these three things were to disappear, not only would the British leave India without the rustling of a leaf, but it would be real swarajya that we would enjoy.
('8', 457, 2, 28, 1084329) Many people exult at the explosion of bombs.

('8', 458, 1, 2, 1084580) ignorance and lack of understanding.
('8', 458, 1, 3, 1084617) If all the British were to be killed, those who kill them would become the masters of India, and as a result India would continue in a state of slavery.
('8', 458, 1, 4, 1084770) The bombs with which the British will have been killed will fall on India after the Bri tish leave.
('8', 458, 1, 5, 1084870) The man who killed the President of the French Republic was himself a Frenchman and the assassin of President Cleveland of America was an American.
('8', 458, 1, 6, 1085018) 1 We ought to be careful, therefore, not to be hasty and thoughtlessly to imitate the people of the West.
('8', 458, 2, 7, 1085124) Just as we cannot achieve real swarajya, by following the path of evilthat is by killing the Britishso also will it not be possible for us to achieve it by establishing big factories in India.
('8', 458, 2, 8, 1085317) Accumulation of gold and silver will not bring swarajya.
('8', 458, 2, 9, 1085374) This has been convincingly proved by Ruskin.
('8', 458, 3, 10, 1085419) Let it be remembered that western civilization is only a hundred years old, or to be more precise, fifty.
('8', 458, 3, 11, 1085525) Within this short span the western people appear to have been reduced to a state of cultural anarchy.
('8', 458, 3, 12, 1085627) We pray that India may never be reduced to the same state as Europe.
('8', 458, 3, 13, 1085696) The western nations are impatient to fall upon one another, and are restrained only by the accumulation of armaments all round.
('8', 458, 3, 14, 1085824) When [the situation] flares up, we will witness a veritable hell let loose in Europe.
('8', 458, 3, 15, 1085910) All [white] nations look upon the black races as their legitimate prey.
('8', 458, 3, 16, 1085982) This is inevitable when money is the only thing that matters.
('8', 458, 3, 17, 1086044) Wherever they find any territory, they swoop down on it like crows upon carrion.
('8', 458, 3, 18, 1086125) There are reasons to suggest that this is the outcome of their large industrial undertakings.
('8', 458, 4, 19, 1086219) To conclude, the demand of swarajya is the demand of every Indian, and it is a just demand.
('8', 458, 4, 20, 1086311) But swarajya is to be achieved by righteous means.
('8', 458, 4, 21, 1086362) It must be real swarajya.
('8', 458, 4, 22, 1086388) It cannot be achieved by violent methods or by setting up factories.
('8', 458, 4, 23, 1086457) We must have industry, but of the right kind.
('8', 458, 4, 24, 1086503) India was once looked upon as a golden land, because Indians then were people of sterling worth.
('8', 458, 4, 25, 1086600) The land is still the same but the people have changed and that is why it has become arid.
('8', 458, 4, 26, 1086691) To transform it into a golden land again we must transmute ourselves into gold by leading a life of virtue.
('8', 458, 4, 27, 1086799) The philosophers stone which can bring this about consists of two syllables: satya.
('8', 458, 5, 28, 1086883) 1 President Cleveland died a natural death.

('8', 459, 3, 7, 1087637) I have the honour to represent the Hamidia Islamic Society of the Transvaal, and I am not aware of a Mahomedan dissentient.
('8', 459, 3, 8, 1087761) They hold the honour of India and their educated countrymen just as dearly as any Indian.
('8', 459, 3, 9, 1087851) In point of fact, my co religionists have stronger objections to the Asiatic Act than the other Indians, for the simple reason that it constitutes a direct attack on Mahomedanism, and offers a deliberate insult to the Caliph of the Faithful, His Imperial Majesty the Sultan of Turkey, who is the spiritual head of Islam, as His Majesty the King Emperor is the temporal head of the citizens of the British Empire.
('8', 459, 3, 10, 1088264) That three Mahomedans gave thumb impressions to the Lic ensing Officer means nothing, except that they did not know what they were doing.
('8', 459, 3, 11, 1088402) The Government have not sufficiently appreciated the service rendered by the Indian community when they gave finger impressions voluntarily; and now the people take time before they understand that the giving of thumb impressions to the Licensing Officer is not the same thing as giving finger impressions under the voluntary arrangement.
('8', 459, 3, 12, 1088741) The act performed before the Licensing Officer is a symbol of the Act which we have forsworn.

('8', 460, 6, 11, 1089857) [JOHANNESBURG, July 20, 1908]
('8', 460, 7, 12, 1089887) In B Court, on Monday last, the 20th instant, before Mr. H. H. Jordan, Mr. Sorabji Shapurji appeared charged with failing to obey the Magistrates order to leave the Colony within seven days of the 10th instant, under Section 7 of the Peace Preservation Ordinance.
('8', 460, 7, 13, 1090151) Mr. Cramer prosecuted, and Mr. M. K. Gandhi appeared for the defence.
('8', 460, 7, 14, 1090221) The accused pleaded not guilty.
('8', 460, 8, 15, 1090253) Superintendent J. G. Vernon stated that he arrested the accused at 7 a.m.
('8', 460, 8, 16, 1090327) on the 20th instant in the Malay Location.
('8', 460, 8, 17, 1090370) He arrested him for not producing a certificate or authority to reside in the Colony after the warning received from the Court to leave within seven days from the 10th instant.
('8', 460, 8, 18, 1090547) The accused replied that he did not intend to leave.
('8', 460, 8, 19, 1090600) Witness handed in a number of copies of the Gazette containing the Asiatic Law Amendment Act, the regulations thereunder, and notices regarding its enforce ment.

('8', 461, 1, 3, 1091142) Asked why then accused had been arrested, witness replied that he did not accept instructions from anyone except his superior officers.
('8', 461, 1, 4, 1091278) He had received instructions to arrest the accused and had used
('8', 461, 2, 5, 1091342) his own discretion in arresting him that morning at 7 a.m., which was the time most convenient to witness.
('8', 461, 2, 6, 1091449) Accused had been kept in custody ever since.
('8', 461, 2, 7, 1091494) This closed the case for the Crown.
('8', 461, 3, 8, 1091530) The accused, giving evidence on his own behalf, stated that, after receiving the notice to leave the Colony, he had remained in the Colony and had told Superin tendent Vernon that it was not his desire to leave.
('8', 461, 3, 9, 1091742) He did not now wish to leave the Colony, and he was there to suffer the penalties for disobeying the order of the Court.
('8', 461, 3, 10, 1091863) He was a British subject, and as long as he shared the full responsibility as a subject of the British Empire he considered that he had every right to remain in the Transvaal.
('8', 461, 4, 11, 1092039) Cross examined [he said] he had disobeyed the order of the Court, and all along intended to disobey it.
('8', 461, 5, 12, 1092143) This closed the case for the defence.
('8', 461, 6, 13, 1092181) Addressing the Court, Mr. Gandhi said he wished to draw His Worships attention to the fact that that was going to be a very terrible struggle for British Indians in the Transvaal, and in connection with that trial several Indians who were waiting outside to enter the Court House were hustled about and were assaulted also.
('8', 461, 7, 14, 1092505) THE MAGISSTRATE: I know nothing about that, and I cannot take an.
('8', 461, 7, 15, 1092571) ex parte statement.
('8', 461, 7, 16, 1092591) There are quite enough in the Court now to make it uncomfortable.
('8', 461, 8, 17, 1092657) MR. GANDHI: That is so, but there are a lot outside.
('8', 461, 9, 18, 1092710) THE MAGISSTRATE: The Court can only hold a certain number.
('8', 461, 10, 19, 1092769) MR. GANDHI: It is a question of handling the thing properly.
('8', 461, 10, 20, 1092830) The Court House is within Your Worships jurisdiction, and I think I might be allowed to make a statement about the matter.
('8', 461, 11, 21, 1092953) THE MAGISSTRATE: All I can say is that the Court is uncomfortably full.
('8', 461, 12, 22, 1093025) Mr. Gandhi then proceeded to refer to the case, which, he stated, was very Simple.
('8', 461, 12, 23, 1093108) (THE MAGISSTRATE: Very simple.) He only wished to draw His Worships attention to the fact that his client, rightly or wrongly, believed that it was a matter of principle to remain in the Colony, and he claimed his right to remain in the Colony under the Immigrants Restriction Act.
('8', 461, 12, 24, 1093390) His client had felt aggrieved that he had been called upon to accept the Asiatic Amendment Act.
('8', 461, 12, 25, 1093486) He had failed to leave the Colony, and he had told the Court that he could not possibly obey an order that was
('8', 461, 13, 26, 1093597) 1 Indians wishing to enter the Court were brutally ill treated by the Police without any provocation, according to a special report in Indian Opinion, 25 7 1908. A constable, whose name was being taken down by G. K. Desai, struck the latter a heavy blow on the face.
('8', 461, 13, 27, 1093864) Affidavits about the Police assault were filed with the Police Commissioner by H. S. L. Polak, Attorney of the Supreme Court, among others.

('8', 462, 1, 3, 1094089) The accused wished to suffer for the sake of principle.
('8', 462, 1, 4, 1094145) He had chosen between his conscience and the order of the Court, and lie had chosen by his conscience.

('8', 462, 4, 8, 1094363) At the conclusion of the Court proceeding 1, Mr. Gandhi addressed the crowd outside his office.
('8', 462, 5, 9, 1094459) Mr. Sorabji, he pointed out, had gone to gaol because of a principle and not to open the gates of the Transvaal to the unrestricted immigration of Asiatics.
('8', 462, 5, 10, 1094616) He had come in under the Immigration Act in order to pass the educational test of that Act which made no distinction as to race, class or colour.
('8', 462, 5, 11, 1094762) He had studied English for seven years, but he now found that all his English was of no avail, notwithstanding that the Immigration Act was general in its application and that he was a British subject in a British Colony.
('8', 462, 6, 12, 1094984) The next step, continued Mr. Gandhi, was for those Indians who possessed licences to return them and stand the consequence of being arrested for trading without licences and going to gaol; also for them to return their certificates.
('8', 462, 6, 13, 1095217) It was only by showing that they were willing to undergo communal suffering and not to avail themselves of any present privileges that they could bring conviction to the minds of the European community that they were fighting for principle.
('8', 462, 6, 14, 1095458) He repeated that the Colonial Secretary had promised unconditionally to repeal the Asiatic Act provided the Asiatics registered voluntarily, but this promise had not been kept.
('8', 462, 7, 15, 1095635) Before the Indians broke up, some handed over their trading licences and several their registration certificates, and it is expected that this example will be largely followed.
('8', 462, 7, 16, 1095812) The Indians, we Understand, are indignant at the manner in which the police cleared them away from the entrance to the Police Court during the after noon, and also at the sentence passed on Mr. Sorabji, contending that hard labour should not have been given for what they consider a political offence.

('8', 463, 19, 29, 1097116) DEAR MR. CARTWRIGHT, This is just to tell you that prosecutions have now started.
('8', 463, 19, 30, 1097198) Mr. Sorabji was sentenced to one months imprisonment with hard labour virtually for non submission to the Asiatic Act.
('8', 463, 19, 31, 1097317) Several hawkers nave been arrested for hawking without licences.
('8', 463, 19, 32, 1097382) They will, so far as I am aware, elect to go to gaol.
('8', 463, 19, 33, 1097436) I hope you will not resent my troubling you with my letters.
('8', 463, 20, 34, 1097497) Yours sincerely, ALBERT CARTWRIGHT, ESQ.

('8', 464, 2, 3, 1097716) [JOHANNESBURG, July 20, 1908]
('8', 464, 3, 4, 1097746) On Monday last, Ebrahim Ismail and Suliman Bagas were brought before Mr. P. C. Dalmahoy in D Court, Johannesburg, charged with hawking without licences.
('8', 464, 3, 5, 1097899) Mr. Shaw prosecuted, and Mr. Gandhi appeared for the defence.
('8', 464, 4, 6, 1097961) The first accused did not appear, and his bail was estreated, though Mr. Gandhi asked that the case might be remanded so that the accused might appear the following day.
('8', 464, 5, 7, 1098131) Suliman Bagas pleaded not guilty.
('8', 464, 5, 8, 1098165) Police evidence was led to the effect that, at 3 30 p.m.
('8', 464, 5, 9, 1098222) on the 18th instant, accused was exposing fruit for sale on the Village Main Reef property.
('8', 464, 5, 10, 1098314) There were several Natives about.
('8', 464, 5, 11, 1098348) Accused was selling fruit from a basket.
('8', 464, 5, 12, 1098389) Witness saw accused sell bananas and oranges.
('8', 464, 5, 13, 1098435) He watched accused for 25 minutes.
('8', 464, 5, 14, 1098470) He asked accused for his licence, and the latter produced one that had expired on June 30, but he did not have one for the current quarter.
('8', 464, 5, 15, 1098610) He was hawking within the municipal area.
('8', 464, 6, 16, 1098652) Cross examined, [he said] he had received instructions to arrest all such men.
('8', 464, 6, 17, 1098731) He did not know whether accused had already applied for a licence.
('8', 464, 7, 18, 1098798) This closed the case for the Prosecution.
('8', 464, 8, 19, 1098840) Accused, giving evidence on his behalf, stated that he had applied for a rene wal of the licence, but he had been asked to give his thumb impression under the Registration Act, and as he had refused to do so, he had not been able to obtain a licence.
('8', 464, 9, 20, 1099091) Mr. Gandhi then stated that he wished to give evidence.
('8', 464, 9, 21, 1099147) It would not be political, but would be entirely relevant to the matter before the Court.
('8', 464, 9, 22, 1099237) His client had not received a licence because instructions had been issued to the Municipality that all Asiatics applying for licences should undergo the formalities prescribed under the Asiatic Law Amendment Act.
('8', 464, 9, 23, 1099451) In the month of January there was a settlement arrived at between the Government and the Asiatic communities whereby those who voluntarily registered were not to come under the Asiatic Act.
('8', 464, 9, 24, 1099641) His client had voluntarily regis tered, and because he had now been called upon to accept the Asiatic Act, under a reso lution passed by the British Indian Association, accused, in common with other Ind ians, had tendered the licence fee but had declined to accept the formalities of the Act.
('8', 464, 10, 25, 1099934) The Magistrate inquired of the Prosecutor whether he had received any

('8', 465, 1, 2, 1100136) instructions in these cases.
('8', 465, 1, 3, 1100165) Mr. Shaw replied in the negative.
('8', 465, 1, 4, 1100199) There were some, some months ago.
('8', 465, 2, 5, 1100233) The Magistrate ordered that the case should be put back until Wednesday, pending inquiry.

('8', 465, 4, 8, 1100377) [JOHANNESBURG, July 20, 1908] We have been informed through Mr. Cartwright that the Government Will agree to a settlement if we do not insist on the rights of educated [Asiatics].
('8', 465, 4, 9, 1100557) But all of you resolved at a previous meetingthat you would agitate for the cause of the educated.
('8', 465, 4, 10, 1100656) Your decision is commendable.
('8', 465, 4, 11, 1100686) We certainly cannot agree to the abolition of the rights of educated Asiatics.
('8', 465, 4, 12, 1100765) Notices were published by the Government in newspapers to the effect that the [Asiatic Registration] Act would stay, and also that those who refused to take out licences would be puni shed in accordance with that law.
('8', 465, 4, 13, 1100983) We cannot take out licences at this juncture, for the Government demands thumb impressions from us under the law.
('8', 465, 4, 14, 1101097) If they had been asked for outside the law, that is, an a voluntary basis, I myself would have advised [that they should be given].
('8', 465, 4, 15, 1101229) But under the law I cannot advise anyone to give even his signature.
('8', 465, 4, 16, 1101298) There are many persons who allege that I have charged a fee of two guineas each from Hindus as well as Muslims.
('8', 465, 4, 17, 1101410) Can anyone at this meeting [come forward and] tell me if I have accepted fees from any of them?
('8', 465, 4, 18, 1101506) The Government blames me for needlessly inciting the people.
('8', 465, 4, 19, 1101567) Whatever the Government may say, my duty is to place the facts as they are before my brethren.
('8', 465, 4, 20, 1101662) So I go on doing my duty, regardless of the Governments accusations.
('8', 465, 4, 21, 1101731) To those who were frightened by the Government notices into taking out licences, I must say that they should not make use of them but court arrest and thereby fill the gaols as they did in January.
('8', 465, 4, 22, 1101929) By doing so they will humble the Government.
('8', 465, 4, 23, 1101974) Many have sought to dissuade the Chairman 1 from going the rounds as a hawker.
('8', 465, 4, 24, 1102053) That was not a nice thing to have done.
('8', 465, 4, 25, 1102093) Those who assume the garb of hawkers not indeed in the service of self interest but for the sake of others interests ought to be proud rather than ashamed of themselves.

('8', 466, 1, 2, 1102320) proud to have such a Chairman.
('8', 466, 1, 3, 1102351) I am sure you are too.
('8', 466, 1, 4, 1102374) We have now no alternative but to go to gaol.
('8', 466, 1, 5, 1102420) The leaders of all communities must go round collecting licences and registers.
('8', 466, 1, 6, 1102500) The burning of registers has been postponed for the time being, but their collection need not be.
('8', 466, 1, 7, 1102598) As for the issue of the educated Asiatics, I must repeat that we must fight it out.
('8', 466, 1, 8, 1102682) If we do not fight for men like Mr. Jinnah, Bar at Law, Mr. justice Ameer Ali or Prince Ranjit Singh, or others equally well educated, we will be at Mr. Chamneys mercy.
('8', 466, 1, 9, 1102851) I leave [the decision in] this matter to your own inclination.
('8', 466, 1, 10, 1102914) This fight requires only courage.
('8', 466, 1, 11, 1102948) Courage by itself constitutes an assurance of victory.
('8', 466, 1, 12, 1103003) All that need be done now is for everyone to take the plunge, armed only with courage.
('8', 466, 1, 13, 1103090) We must thus prove ourselves to be brave men.
('8', 466, 1, 14, 1103136) If we do so, our demands are bound to be conceded.

('8', 466, 3, 17, 1103269) [JOHANNESBURG, July 21, 1908]
('8', 466, 4, 18, 1103299) On Tuesday, the 21st instant, in the same Court [before Mr. P. C. Dalmahoy in D Court], Ismail Akoojee was charged with trading without a licence.
('8', 466, 4, 19, 1103446) He pleaded not guilty.
('8', 466, 4, 20, 1103469) Mr. Gandhi appeared for the defence.
('8', 466, 5, 21, 1103506) J. B. Barret stated that he was a Licensing Inspector under the Johannesburg Municipality.
('8', 466, 5, 22, 1103597) On the previous day, on the Market Square, within the Municipal area, he had seen accused exposing fruit for sale.
('8', 466, 5, 23, 1103712) He had asked accused for his licence, but the latter had replied that he did not have one.
('8', 466, 6, 24, 1103803) Cross examined, [he said] he did not know anything about Government instructions.
('8', 466, 7, 25, 1103885) T. H. Jefferson stated that he was Chief Licensing Inspector of the Municipality of Johannesburg.
('8', 466, 7, 26, 1103983) He produced Government Gazettes containing the Asiatic Law Amendment Act, the regulations thereunder, and the notices thereunder authorizing him to prosecute.
('8', 466, 7, 27, 1104142) He had seen a letter addressed to the Town Clerk by the Registrar of Asiatics, dated the 7th instant, stating that the Asiatic Law Amendment Act was to remain on the Statute book, and that no licences were to be renewed or issued except to Asiatics who produced registration certificates and gave thumb prints under the Act.
('8', 466, 8, 28, 1104467) Cross examined, he recollected that, in January last, several prosecutions took place, and that Asiatics were then sentenced.
('8', 466, 9, 29, 1104593) In the month of February the Government had issued instructions to him to
('8', 467, 0, 1, 1104667) 468 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 467, 1, 2, 1104709) issue licences to all Asiatics who produced a letter from the Registrar of Asiatics acknowledging having received an application for voluntary registration.
('8', 467, 1, 3, 1104866) Such Asiatics were not called upon to give any thumb impressions at all.
('8', 467, 1, 4, 1104939) It was competent then for him to give licences for the quarter ended March 31, and afterwards he was authorized to issue licences to the quarter ended June 30. He did not think that any licences had been issued from his Department for the whole year.
('8', 467, 1, 5, 1105190) The instructions contained in the letter of the 7th instant were the revised and most recent ones.
('8', 467, 1, 6, 1105289) He admitted that many Asiatics had produced voluntary registration certificates but had declined to give thumb impressions.
('8', 467, 2, 7, 1105413) [MAGISSTRATE:] If thumb impressions are refused?
('8', 467, 3, 8, 1105462) JEFFERSON: I refuse to give licences.
('8', 467, 3, 9, 1105500) The registration certificate must be produced.
('8', 467, 4, 10, 1105547) Witness did not think that there had been any refusal to produce registration certificates.
('8', 467, 4, 11, 1105639) Registration certificates had not been produced only by those who had not received them.
('8', 467, 5, 12, 1105728) In reply to the Magistrate, witness stated that it was unnecessary up to the end of June to give thumb impressions.
('8', 467, 5, 13, 1105844) There had been no intimation thereafter of that requirement until Asiatics came to apply for licences.
('8', 467, 5, 14, 1105947) There was nothing in the Gazette as to not giving thumb marks up to the end of June.
('8', 467, 5, 15, 1106032) That appeared to be an act of grace on the part of the Government.
('8', 467, 6, 16, 1106099) This closed the case for the Crown.
('8', 467, 7, 17, 1106135) Accused giving evidence on his own behalf stated that he had applied for a licence during the current month.
('8', 467, 7, 18, 1106244) He had offered the licence fee.
('8', 467, 7, 19, 1106276) The licence was refused to him because they wanted his thumb impression under the Act which he had refused to give.
('8', 467, 7, 20, 1106392) He had the licence up to the end of June and also a voluntary registration certificate.
('8', 467, 8, 21, 1106480) Cross examined, [he said] he was not hawking without a licence at the time stated, but was walking along with his fruit in a basket on his way to the fruit store.
('8', 467, 8, 22, 1106643) He was not looking for customers.
('8', 467, 8, 23, 1106677) He admitted, however, that he had been hawking in the morning without a licence.
('8', 467, 8, 24, 1106758) This closed the case for the defence.
('8', 467, 9, 25, 1106796) Mr. Gandhi, addressing the Court said that he really had very little more to say than what he had said in evidence the previous afternoon.
('8', 467, 9, 26, 1106935) It appeared that the Government had first issued one set of instructions and afterwards another and the position was that the Indians did not know where they were.
('8', 467, 9, 27, 1107099) If the Government wished to proceed, they should proceed against those who Were the leaders and not against men like the accused.
('8', 467, 10, 28, 1107229) Accused was sentenced to pay a fine of 10s or to go to gaol [for] four days with hard labour.
('8', 467, 11, 29, 1107323) Similar sentences were imposed on Moosa Essop, Hari Bhikha, Dyah Parag, Saleji Bemath, Ismail Ebrahim, Keshav Goolab, and Nagar Morar, who were also defended by Mr. Gandhi.

('8', 468, 1, 3, 1107658) A few minutes afterwards he entered the Court and stated that he had not heard his name called.
('8', 468, 1, 4, 1107754) Mr. Gandhi asked that his bail might be refunded, but the Magistrate stated that he did not have the power to do this.

('8', 468, 15, 22, 1108428) Mr. Gandhi, in a letter to General Smuts, points out that, while so many of the rank and file of the community are suffering imprisonment under the Registration Act, he himself, who has also not taken out a certificate, and is the chief instrument in his countrymen having done what they have, is still at large.
('8', 468, 15, 23, 1108741) He asks, Is it coura geous to leave me alone and to harass poor Indians? He reasserts his eagerness to serve the people of the Transvaal generally as to serve his own countrymen.

('8', 469, 3, 4, 1109401) DEAR MR. CARTWRIGHT, Eight Indian hawkers, four Mahomedans and four Hindus, have gone to gaol today for four days imprisonment for hawking without licences.
('8', 469, 3, 5, 1109558) 1 The imprisonment was with hard labour.
('8', 469, 3, 6, 1109599) Mr. Imam Abdul Cader, Chairman of the Hamidia Islamic Society, Mr. T. Naidoo, co signatory with me to the letter sent from the gaol, and four others have also been arrested for hawking without licences.
('8', 469, 3, 7, 1109802) These last are all gentlemen who, in the ordinary walk of life, are not hawkers, but they have taken.
('8', 469, 3, 8, 1109904) to it by way of protest.
('8', 469, 3, 9, 1109929) The arrest of Imam Abdul Cader will create a sensation, not only in South Africa, but throughout India.

('8', 469, 6, 16, 1110385) [JOHANNESBURG, July 21, 1908]
('8', 469, 7, 17, 1110415) Early on Tuesday morning Mr. Thambi Naidoo, a member of the Committee of the British Indian Association, and on Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Imam Abdool Cadir Bawazeer, Chairman of the Hamidia Islamic Society, Messrs G. P. Vyas, Mahomed Ebrahim Kunkey, M. G. Patel and G. K. Desai were arrested for hawking without a licence.
('8', 469, 7, 18, 1110735) They refused to be bailed out and were brought before the Court on Wednesday.
('8', 469, 7, 19, 1110813) There were charged with trading without having proper licences.
('8', 469, 8, 20, 1110877) J. B. Barnett 2,Inspector of Licences, stated he arrested the accused at 2 30 P.M. yesterday 3 at the corner of Market and Simmonds Streets.
('8', 469, 8, 21, 1111018) They stated they had not taken out licences.
('8', 469, 9, 22, 1111063) Mr. Gandhi, who defended, called Imam Abdool Cadir Bawazeer, who said, in

('8', 469, 10, 24, 1111201) 3 July 21, 1908, the day before the trial
('8', 470, 0, 1, 1111243) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 471
('8', 470, 1, 2, 1111288) reply to his question, that he was chairman of the Hamidia Islamic Society and the Assistant Priest of the Indian Mosque.
('8', 470, 1, 3, 1111410) He had lately taken to hawking.
('8', 470, 2, 4, 1111442) [GANDHIJI:] Will you explain to the Court why?
('8', 470, 3, 5, 1111489) [BAWAZEER:] Because there was a compromise between General Smuts and some of the Indian leaders .
('8', 470, 4, 6, 1111587) The Crown Prosecutor intervened, and asked if the witness knew this of his own knowledge.
('8', 470, 5, 7, 1111677) THE MAGISSTRATE: Has he got permission from the Colonial Secretary to hawk without a licence?
('8', 470, 6, 8, 1111771) MR. GANDHI: No.
('8', 470, 7, 9, 1111787) Continuing, Mr. Gandhi said the reason why he wanted to lead evidence was just the same as that he gave yesterday.
('8', 470, 7, 10, 1111902) The Court had a right to know, he thought, why a gentleman occupying the position of the accused had taken to hawking.
('8', 470, 8, 11, 1112021) The Magistrate said it was not a matter which concerned the Court.
('8', 470, 9, 12, 1112088) Mr. Gandhi replied that, if that was not a question of interest, it was a question of justice.
('8', 470, 10, 13, 1112183) Witness, continuing, said that when the compromise was effected he assisted in fulfilling it, but he now found that the compromise, so far as the Government was concerned, was not being properly fulfilled, and as a protest he took to hawking without a licence.
('8', 470, 11, 14, 1112444) The Magistrate asked : Was he one of the 14 people exempted?
('8', 470, 12, 15, 1112505) Mr. Gandhi said he did not know of any exemptions.
('8', 470, 12, 16, 1112556) If there were people exempted, they were in a most fortunate position.
('8', 470, 13, 17, 1112627) The Crown Prosecutor said there were a certain number of exemptions, and witness would probably know if he was exempt.
('8', 470, 14, 18, 1112746) Mr. Gandhi said he had not the slightest information of any exemption.
('8', 470, 14, 19, 1112817) His position was that his client felt aggrieved and decided to suffer with his poorer countrymen because they were suddenly called upon to submit to the Asiatic Act, having complied with voluntary registration.
('8', 470, 14, 20, 1113028) They thought they would not be called upon to do so.
('8', 470, 15, 21, 1113081) THE MAGISSTRATE: You took to hawking lately to put yourself in the same position as the hawkers?
('8', 470, 16, 22, 1113178) ACCUSED : I took to hawking to defend my people.
('8', 470, 17, 23, 1113227) MR. GANDHI: You are one of the people who assisted the Government in carrying out the compromise?
('8', 470, 18, 24, 1113325) [ACCUSED:] Yes; I endeavoured to explain to my own people what the compromise was, and I told them if they complied with voluntary registration, they would not be called upon to submit.
('8', 470, 19, 25, 1113511) [GANDHIJI:] And the members of the Society you represent followed your advice and took out voluntary registration certificates?
('8', 471, 0, 1, 1113639) 472 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 471, 1, 2, 1113681) [ACCUSED :] Yes.
('8', 471, 2, 3, 1113698) In further examination, the witness said he had seen a circular in connection with hawkers who did not comply with the Act.
('8', 471, 2, 4, 1113822) He was married and had a wife and children residing in Johannesburg, and he had resided there himself for 13 years.
('8', 471, 3, 5, 1113938) THE EXEMPTIONS
('8', 471, 4, 6, 1113953) Mr. T. H. Jefferson, Chief Inspector of Licences, called by Mr. Gandhi, stated he had got a list of names of people who were exempted from having to comply with the terms of the Act.
('8', 471, 4, 7, 1114136) They were not compelled to give thumb impressions.
('8', 471, 4, 8, 1114187) He could not recall the names and he only got the list yesterday.
('8', 471, 4, 9, 1114253) He did not know if any of the accused were exempt.
('8', 471, 5, 10, 1114304) Mr. Gandhi, in his address to the Court, said the only point he would deal with was the question of exemptions.
('8', 471, 5, 11, 1114416) He asked the Court to take note of the arbitrary proceedings on the part of the Government.
('8', 471, 5, 12, 1114508) He had absolutely no knowledge that there were any exemptions, but he wished to point out that in the Asiatic Act there was absolutely no authority given to the Government to grant exemptions, and was the Court going to countenance an arbitrary administration of the Act?
('8', 471, 6, 13, 1114780) The Magistrate said the charge was admitted and that was all he had got to do with it.
('8', 471, 6, 14, 1114867) He sentenced the accused to pay a fine of 10 s or [undergo] imprisonment for four days with hard labour.
('8', 471, 7, 15, 1114972) Mahomed Ebrahim Kunkey, Moosa Bagas, Mahomed Ebrahim, Ahmed Mahomed Motara and S. Bagas were similarly sentenced after formal evidence.
('8', 471, 8, 16, 1115108) Thambi Naidoo was also charged with hawking without a licence, and after formal evidence of arrest the accused gave evidence.
('8', 471, 8, 17, 1115234) He stated he was a cartage contractor and had taken to hawking since last Friday.
('8', 471, 8, 18, 1115316) He went to gaol in January last for non compliance with the Registration Act.
('8', 471, 8, 19, 1115394) He was one of the signatories to the letter addressed to General Smuts in connection with the compromise, and in trying to carry out the Indian part of the compromise, he suffered assault.
('8', 471, 9, 20, 1115583) A similar sentence to [sic] the others was passed.

('8', 471, 11, 23, 1115701) THE COMBAT DEEPENS
('8', 471, 12, 24, 1115720) Mr. Sorabji is in gaol.
('8', 471, 12, 25, 1115744) He got one months hard labour.
('8', 471, 12, 26, 1115775) It has now become the duty of every Indian to volunteer for imprisonment.
('8', 471, 12, 27, 1115849) Mr. Sorabji was arrested and taken to prison at seven on Monday in the extreme cold of morning.
('8', 471, 12, 28, 1115945) There was no need to have done this.
('8', 471, 12, 29, 1115982) Mr. Gandhi had sent a notice [to the authorities] saying that Mr. Sora bji would present himself whenever required, and this was ignored.
('8', 472, 0, 1, 1116120) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 473
('8', 472, 1, 2, 1116165) Hundreds of Indians had turned up to hear the case.
('8', 472, 1, 3, 1116217) Only a few were allowed to enter.
('8', 472, 1, 4, 1116251) The number of whites admitted was, however, quite large.
('8', 472, 1, 5, 1116308) The Indians who remained outside were treated in a mosthigh handed fashion.
('8', 472, 1, 6, 1116384) Mr. Gulabbhai Kikabhai [Desai], Mr. Cursetji Desai and others were beaten up.
('8', 472, 1, 7, 1116462) Quite a few were insulted.
('8', 472, 1, 8, 1116489) The matter was reported to the Magistrate, who, however, took no notice.
('8', 472, 2, 9, 1116562) There was hardly any evidence to be offered in the case.
('8', 472, 2, 10, 1116619) Mr. Sorabji had to choose between two things: his honour and patrio tism, and the order of the Court.
('8', 472, 2, 11, 1116721) Mr. Sorabji chose patriotism rather than the order of the Court.
('8', 472, 2, 12, 1116786) The Magistrate passed the sentence.
('8', 472, 2, 13, 1116822) But Mr. Sorabji welcomed it as though it were a great honour.
('8', 472, 2, 14, 1116884) The Magistrate will have to answer for his high handedness.
('8', 472, 2, 15, 1116944) The Association moved [for action] against the constables who assaulted [the Indian].
('8', 472, 2, 16, 1117030) 2 We are not concerned with whether or not the police or the Court takes cognizance of the complaint.
('8', 472, 2, 17, 1117132) All this tyranny is the consequence of our being thought an un worthy people.
('8', 472, 2, 18, 1117210) When the authorities realize our strength, they them selves will feel humbled.
('8', 472, 3, 19, 1117289) SENTENCES ON HAWKERS
('8', 472, 4, 20, 1117310) Messrs Ismail Akoojee, Moosa Essop, Dahya Prag, Hari Bhikha, Saleji Bemat, Ismail Ibrahim, Keshav Gulab, and Nagaji Morar, all hawkers, have been arrested.
('8', 472, 4, 21, 1117466) Their case was heard on Tuesday.
('8', 472, 4, 22, 1117499) 3 After evidence had been tendered in their cases, Mr. Gandhi pointed out that arresting these men amounted to an attack on the poor.
('8', 472, 4, 23, 1117633) They were not criminals.
('8', 472, 4, 24, 1117658) He asked why the Indian leaders who had openly
('8', 472, 5, 25, 1117705) 1 Vide  Trial of Sorabji Shapurji III, 20 7 1908 2 Gulabbhai Kikabhai Desai, Cursetji Hormasji Desai and Polak filed affidavits regarding this incident with the Commissioner of Police, asking that the constables concerned should be proceeded against.
('8', 472, 5, 26, 1117956) According to Polaks affidavit, since only one side of the folding doors of the Court was opened, there was a rush of Indians endeavouring to enter.
('8', 472, 5, 27, 1118104) Constable B 99 from the open space outside the Court made a rush at the crowd, using his fists and shoulders entirely without provocation.
('8', 472, 5, 28, 1118243) I found Gulabbhai Kikabhai Desai with the right side of his face inflamed and his right eye suffused with blood.
('8', 472, 5, 29, 1118356) He told me that Constable B 60 had just given him a violent blow.
('8', 472, 5, 30, 1118422) Although he remonstrated strongly to Superintendent Vernon, the latter took no notice .

('8', 473, 1, 3, 1118640) The Government had issued licences independently of the [Asiatic Registration] Act in February.
('8', 473, 1, 4, 1118736) Why did it now insist on issuing them only under the Act?
('8', 473, 1, 5, 1118794) The Magistrate sentenced these Indians to a fine of 10s each or, in default, four days imprisonment.
('8', 473, 1, 6, 1118895) The brave Indians have offered to go to gaol, refusing to pay the fine.
('8', 473, 2, 7, 1118967) IMAM SAHEB ARRESTED
('8', 473, 3, 8, 1118987) On Tuesday afternoon, Imam Abdool Bawazeer and Messrs Gavarishankar Vyas, Mulji Patel and Gulabbhai Kikabhai Desai were arrested.
('8', 473, 3, 9, 1119117) They were hawking in Market Square.
('8', 473, 3, 10, 1119153) Mr. Thambi Naidoo was arrested on Tuesday morning.
('8', 473, 3, 11, 1119204) He was arrested on the same charge.
('8', 473, 3, 12, 1119240) Mr. Gavarishankar Vyas and Mr. Thambi Naidoo, too, were in gaol in January.
('8', 473, 3, 13, 1119316) All of them refused to bail out.
('8', 473, 3, 14, 1119349) Is there any Indian who does not both weep and smile on reading this?
('8', 473, 3, 15, 1119419) One cannot but weep at the thought of these Indians, used to a life of comfort, undergoing so much suffering for the sake of their motherland.
('8', 473, 3, 16, 1119562) One must smile at the thought that there are men of such rare courage in the Indian community, who will be the means of its deliverance.
('8', 473, 3, 17, 1119699) Mr. Abdool Kadir Bawazeer is an Imam.
('8', 473, 3, 18, 1119737) He is Chairman of the Hamidia Islamic Society.
('8', 473, 3, 19, 1119784) I would say that, on the day on which he is gaoled, Indians throughout South Africa should go on a strike.
('8', 473, 3, 20, 1119891) Wednesday [July 22, 1908] After sending off the above report yesterday, I heard that Mr. Ebrahim Kunkey had been arrested.
('8', 473, 3, 21, 1120014) Mr. Imam Abdool Kadir and others whose names I have already mentioned and Mr. Kunkey refused to offer bail and remained in gaol for the night.
('8', 473, 3, 22, 1120157) Plenty of food was sent to them in gaol.
('8', 473, 3, 23, 1120198) Each of them was given three light blankets for a bedding.
('8', 473, 3, 24, 1120257) Their case came up for hearing today, Wednesday, at eleven oclock.
('8', 473, 4, 25, 1120324) Deposing, Imam Saheb said that he had taken to hawking in the interests of others.
('8', 473, 4, 26, 1120407) He had helped the Government with the settlement.
('8', 473, 4, 27, 1120457) He could not bear to think that he was free while his brethren who were obliged to take out trade licences were in gaol.
('8', 473, 4, 28, 1120578) He had therefore decided to hawk without a licence.
('8', 473, 4, 29, 1120630) This is what Imam Saheb said.

('8', 474, 3, 6, 1121092) In addition, the cases of Mr. Moosa Bagas, Mr. Suliman Bagas 1, Mr. Mahomed Ibrahim and Mr. Ahmed Mahomed Motara were also heard.
('8', 474, 3, 7, 1121222) They were also sentenced as above, and have taken up resi dence in gaol.
('8', 474, 3, 8, 1121295) By Saturday, all of them will have come out free men.
('8', 474, 3, 9, 1121349) I hope that they will all take up the basket again for the sake of their country and start on their rounds, and thus be re installed in gaol.
('8', 474, 3, 10, 1121491) Along with Imam Abdool Kadir, Mr. Vyas and Mr. Naidoo have also gone to gaol.
('8', 474, 3, 11, 1121569) These two have already been to gaol once.
('8', 474, 3, 12, 1121611) It is ne edless, I think, to speak [again] of their services [to the Indian cause].
('8', 474, 3, 13, 1121695) Mr. Mahomed Ebrahim Kunkey, the other person who has gone to gaol, had closed down his shop and taken to hawking.
('8', 474, 3, 14, 1121809) His courage, too, is boundless.
('8', 474, 3, 15, 1121841) He is a Konkani 2 and has brought credit to his community by thus going to gaol.
('8', 474, 3, 16, 1121922) Mr. Kunkey has also been very active at meetings and has inspired a number of persons with courage.
('8', 474, 3, 17, 1122022) Mr. Mulji Patel has only recently come from India.
('8', 474, 3, 18, 1122073) He has had experience of [addressing] meetings in Bombay.
('8', 474, 3, 19, 1122131) He, too, volunteered to go to gaol for the sake of the country.
('8', 474, 3, 20, 1122195) Mr. Gulabbhai Kikabhai Desai has not only gone to gaol but has also suffered the experience of being manhandled near the Court entrance.
('8', 474, 3, 21, 1122332) That those who have never been hawkers have taken to hawking is a great thing, credit for which must go to Mr. Essop Mia.
('8', 474, 3, 22, 1122454) He was the first to do this.
('8', 474, 3, 23, 1122483) He set out on his rounds with two baskets slung about his neck.
('8', 474, 3, 24, 1122547) At a critical moment, Mr. Essop Mia thus rendered the community great service.
('8', 474, 3, 25, 1122626) He has wealth, intelligence, courage.
('8', 474, 3, 26, 1122664) And he has also a well trained body.
('8', 474, 3, 27, 1122701) At the moment, he is using all these in the service of the community.
('8', 474, 3, 28, 1122771) He placed his time at its disposal.
('8', 474, 3, 29, 1122807) He suffered violence to his person.
('8', 474, 3, 30, 1122843) And now he has taken to hawking for the sake of the community.
('8', 474, 3, 31, 1122906) It will not be surprising if he is also sent to gaol in a few days.

('8', 482, 9, 10, 1140738) Nineteen centuries ago one of the greatest moralists of the world laid down his life in passive resistance to constituted authority in what was then a great centre of spiritual activity.
('8', 482, 9, 11, 1140925) The ground for the resistance was unquestionably valid, as it has continued down to this day a memorable and living example of loyal submission to human law, where such submission was not in direct conflict with the higher law of conscience.
('8', 482, 9, 12, 1141167) The resistance had reference to an injunction that a living faith in a superhuman or divine power was to be abjured, and a claim to spiritual kingship over a certain race of people was to be renounced in favour of the temporal power then existing.
('8', 482, 9, 13, 1141415) We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ, a King. To Pilates question, after asking him whether he put the question of himself, Jesus said: My Kingdom is not of this world: if My Kingdom were of this world then would My servants fight. His death on the cross has ever been a unique episode in the worlds historya magnificent example of what disobedience to the law really meant.
('8', 482, 9, 14, 1141872) There was no question as to the doubtful character of the authority which sought to enforce the decree of death by crucifixion.
('8', 482, 9, 15, 1142000) The illegal nature of the punishment was not in itself a matter of dispute.
('8', 482, 9, 16, 1142076) It was harsh; it was unjust; it was rigorous in the extreme; it was wholly unmerited.
('8', 482, 9, 17, 1142162) But he who found himself placed in subjection to the law as it then operated, and to the authority which asserted itself in carrying out that law, deemed it within his right, in obedience to his conscience, to resist both, but in a passive manner: there was no idea of resisting it by force.
('8', 482, 9, 18, 1142454) A combination of his servants and followers against the law would have been a direct condemnation of his faith.
('8', 482, 9, 19, 1142566) A concerted action to enforce his claim by physical means would have been derogatory to his moral character and to his high mission.
('8', 482, 9, 20, 1142699) And so the man who had the most powerful force behind him, by virtue of his transcendent moral swaya force irresistible in its inherent strength, and overwhelming in its ultimate result, if put into effectpreferred to resist the law
('8', 483, 0, 1, 1142932) 484 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 483, 1, 2, 1142974) by submitting to the dread decree pronounced against him for breaking the laws (to him) unlawful demand.
('8', 483, 2, 3, 1143079) During the same epoch of Christian history, and but a few months after the consummation of Christ, a holy man met martyrdom at the hands of his adversaries.
('8', 483, 2, 4, 1143236) His offence was speaking blasphemous words against Moses and against God.
('8', 483, 2, 5, 1143310) He, however, proved a passive resister.
('8', 483, 2, 6, 1143350) His detractors proceeded to open violence.
('8', 483, 2, 7, 1143393) He was dragged out of the city and stoned to death.
('8', 483, 2, 8, 1143445) Upon the removal of Stephen a general persecution was raised against the Church people at Jerusalem.
('8', 483, 2, 9, 1143546) Men and women were haled and committed to prison.
('8', 483, 2, 10, 1143596) Thus passive resistance obtained Divine sanction, and men had recourse to it as the only effective weapon against tyranny and injustice and oppression.
('8', 483, 2, 11, 1143748) As martyrdom was a penalty of self consciousness, born of the deepest convictions in religious life, so in civil life those whose minds and whose consciences revolt against oppressive laws, against laws which seek to take away the best of manhood and to degrade humanity, adopt passive resistance as the most effectual salve to their outraged consciences.
('8', 483, 3, 12, 1144104) What kind of Society is it which, at this period, has for its base, in equality and injustice?
('8', 483, 3, 13, 1144199) The hell of the poor makes the paradise of the rich.
('8', 483, 3, 14, 1144252) Not only has happiness not come, but honour has fled.
('8', 483, 4, 15, 1144306) We should be sorry to think with Victor Hugo that this is so.
('8', 483, 4, 16, 1144368) And yet Tolstoy and Hugo shine as two of the greatest minds which have probed into the deeps of humanity in our time.
('8', 483, 4, 17, 1144486) Thoreau, one of the greatest of American moralists, the author of The Duty of Civil Disobedience, was a martyr to his principlesprinciples dictated by the highest sense of duty to the State, as well as obedience to conscience.
('8', 483, 4, 18, 1144713) Human convictions may be right or wrong, but there is always a limit to human endurance in the fulfilment of human law.
('8', 483, 4, 19, 1144833) No man today will pretend to deny to a modern Japanese the highest form of personal courage and the severest form of moral rectitude.
('8', 483, 4, 20, 1144967) They have been apparent to us of late years in many ways.
('8', 483, 4, 21, 1145025) To us his Bushido may seem a blind fetish, but its true meaning, its deep significance, is understood and appreciated by the deepest thinkers of our day.
('8', 483, 4, 22, 1145179) They know it touches the deep chords of humanity.
('8', 483, 4, 23, 1145229) When we have grasped the true moral side of Japanese ethics, and realize to ourselves what a changed being a cultured Japanese has become under the law of evolution, it will be easy for us to understand why at moments of great trial when the spirit of patriotism and family relationship is in the ascendant he passively resists the admonitions of the inner monitor, refuses to save his life, and creates for himself a moral injunction as it were for physical extinction so as to reach up to a spiritual life of national redemption and regeneration.
('8', 483, 5, 24, 1145778) Passive resistance as a political weapon and a moral action has, therefore, the fullest possible justification behind it.
('8', 483, 5, 25, 1145900) To offer physical force against recognized authority which seeks to enforce any law, good or bad, would be morally wrong.
('8', 483, 5, 26, 1146022) When you however resist the law, not actively but passively, you thereby imply that what is good and just law to some may be bad to others.
('8', 483, 5, 27, 1146162) While human institutions

('8', 484, 1, 2, 1146232) continue, imperfect men of strong conscience and rational ideas will adopt this mode of expressing their protest against iniquitous ordinances.
('8', 484, 2, 3, 1146376) Under any form of government power is relegated to a group of men to judge in righteousness and to rule with equity and justice.
('8', 484, 2, 4, 1146505) It does not follow that, because men are called to power and are invested with authority to enact laws, they must be considered immaculate or infallible.
('8', 484, 2, 5, 1146659) Too often the best menthe most humane, the most just, the most practical, the most considerateremain subjects, and do not become rulers or framers of laws for their fellow men.
('8', 484, 2, 6, 1146836) Similarly, too often those who attain to power are inconsiderate, tyrannical, unjust.
('8', 484, 2, 7, 1146922) If proof were needed, it will be found ready to hand from almost every country and from every age.
('8', 484, 2, 8, 1147021) To take a recent case in point from a nation in the front rank, I would cite the passive resistance offered by a large section of highly educated people in England against the last Education Act.
('8', 484, 2, 9, 1147217) Here we have a form of government which has undergone a purifying process during centuries of civilizationa government which, by common admission, has reached almost the highest limit of advanced democracy, in which power is attained by a just and equitable processby sheer force of intellect and reasona government which bears on the face of it every element of moral right and expediency.
('8', 484, 2, 10, 1147608) Yet we see a law promulgated apparently in the best interests of the whole community, but which proves in its operation, directly antagonistic to, and unacceptable by a large, intelligent and otherwise obedient section of that community.
('8', 484, 2, 11, 1147846) Numerous laws are in operation to which it gives willing and unquestioned obedience, but, owing to reasons which have swayed humanity in all ages, it finds that its conscience revolts against the new measure.
('8', 484, 2, 12, 1148055) The new enactment caused a serious conflict in their minds: it warred against their sense of right.
('8', 484, 2, 13, 1148155) It therefore simply declined to do the laws bidding and accepted the consequent penalties.
('8', 484, 3, 14, 1148246) Laws are said to be made for the safety, the security and the protection of the interests of the people: they are not made to chastise and oppress.
('8', 484, 3, 15, 1148394) They must be guided by reason, necessity, expediency in the interests of all.
('8', 484, 3, 16, 1148472) They must injure none: they must not remorselessly override the domain of reason and conscience.
('8', 484, 3, 17, 1148569) They must act with justice and circumspection.
('8', 484, 3, 18, 1148616) Render unto Caesar that which is Caesars does not mean that men should resign themselves body and soul to the law, at the laws bidding.
('8', 484, 3, 19, 1148752) Three times within my knowledge has a high minded, law abiding and intelligent citizen met the laws injunctions by paying the required fine instead of complying with the law which demanded that he should have his child vaccinated.
('8', 484, 3, 20, 1148983) On moral grounds he was right not to set aside his conscientious scruples.
('8', 484, 3, 21, 1149058) To salve his conscience he became a passive resister.
('8', 484, 3, 22, 1149112) In the words of Thoreau, this man was a man first and a subject afterwards.
('8', 484, 3, 23, 1149188) He obeyed the law of conscience before blindly complying with the alternative of man made law.
('8', 484, 3, 24, 1149283) It is not desirable to cultivate a respect for the law so much as for the right.
('8', 484, 3, 25, 1149364) The only obligation which I
('8', 485, 0, 1, 1149392) 486 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 485, 1, 2, 1149434) have a right to assume is to do at any time what I think right. III
('8', 485, 2, 3, 1149502) Passive resistance is indeed an extreme course with an honest man; he is generally driven to that course by the stress of physical power, and hence his action is not unjustifiable on moral grounds.
('8', 485, 2, 4, 1149700) If passive resistance on the part of a minority in a state becomes an imperative necessity, then the majority cannot continue strong for long; it is bound to weaken and become effete as to its action in the matter of en forcing its power or its authority against that minority.
('8', 485, 2, 5, 1149978) And passive resistance of subjects, who are not even legal units of a lawful or legally constituted Government, has all the more reason for its action, in a given case, since such a Government cannot justly impose burdens or restrictions on units which had no voice in its creation.
('8', 485, 2, 6, 1150261) Such imposition of burdens on one particular section of a community would be tyrannical, and must ultimately tend to endanger the political fabric of that community.
('8', 485, 2, 7, 1150427) The very raison detre of the Government would, in these circumstances, become open to question.
('8', 485, 3, 8, 1150523) There is so much force in what Thoreau has written on the ethics of passive resistance that I make no apology for introducing here some of the relevant passages bearing on the subject of civil disobedience.
('8', 485, 4, 9, 1150730) Unjust laws exist: shall we be content to obey them, or shall we endeavour to amend them, and obey them until we have succeeded, or shall we transgress them at once?
('8', 485, 4, 10, 1150896) Men generally, under such a government as this, (United States) think that they ought to wait until they have persuaded the majority to alter them.
('8', 485, 4, 11, 1151044) They think that, if they should resist, the remedy would be worse than the evil.
('8', 485, 4, 12, 1151125) But it is the fault of the government itself that the remedy is worse than the evil.
('8', 485, 4, 13, 1151210) It makes it worse.
('8', 485, 4, 14, 1151229) Why is it not more apt to anticipate and provide for reform?
('8', 485, 4, 15, 1151290) Why does it not cherish its wise minority?
('8', 485, 4, 16, 1151333) Why does it cry and resist before it is hurt ?
('8', 485, 4, 17, 1151380) Why does it not encourage its citizens to be on the alert to point out its faults, and do better than it would have [by] them?
('8', 485, 5, 18, 1151507) Action from principle, the perception and performance of right, changes things and relations; it is essentially revolutionary, and does not consist wholly with anything which was.
('8', 485, 5, 19, 1151687) It not only divides states and churches, it divides families: ay, it divides the individual, separating the diabolical in him from the divine.
('8', 485, 6, 20, 1151830) Speaking of the inconsistent side of the aggregate intelligence placed in authority and power, he says:
('8', 485, 7, 21, 1151934) After all, the practical reason why, when the power is once in the hands of the people, a majority are permitted, and for a long period continue, to rule, is not because they are most likely to be in the right, not because this seems fairest to the minority, but because they are physically the strongest.
('8', 485, 7, 22, 1152240) But a Government in which the majority rule in all cases cannot be based on justice, even as far as men understand it.
('8', 486, 0, 1, 1152359) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 487
('8', 486, 1, 2, 1152404) I think that it is enough if they have God on their side without waiting for that other one.
('8', 486, 1, 3, 1152497) Moreover, any man more right than his neighbours constitutes a majority of one already.
('8', 486, 1, 4, 1152585) Under a government which imprisons any unjustly the true place for a just man is also prison.
('8', 486, 2, 5, 1152679) Modern conditions have altered the whole face of State administration.
('8', 486, 2, 6, 1152750) The voting system under a party government often, however, places an illiberal group of men in place and power.
('8', 486, 2, 7, 1152862) To meet conditions of this kind, Thoreau exhorts all honest men in this wise:
('8', 486, 3, 8, 1152940) Cast your whole vote, not a strip of paper merely, but your whole influence.
('8', 486, 3, 9, 1153017) A minority is powerless while it conforms to the majority; it is not even a minority then; but it is irresistible when it clogs by its whole weight.
('8', 486, 4, 10, 1153166) Upwards of four centuries before the advent of Christ, Socrates, of Greece, was reputed to be the wisest moralist of his age.
('8', 486, 4, 11, 1153292) His unflinching integrity made him many enemies.
('8', 486, 4, 12, 1153341) The State, or rather those in power in the State, accused him of corrupting the Athenian youth and of despising the national gods.
('8', 486, 4, 13, 1153472) He was indicted in a regular manner.
('8', 486, 4, 14, 1153509) His chief offence consisted in his heeding the divine voice or inward monitor, which people in those times did not comprehend as clearly as he did.
('8', 486, 4, 15, 1153657) He declared that his demon rebuked him for misconduct, and commended him for every good word and work.
('8', 486, 4, 16, 1153760) He was in advance of his times.
('8', 486, 4, 17, 1153792) And for his originality, integrity and wisdom be was condemned to death.
('8', 486, 4, 18, 1153865) When one of his disciples exclaimed How shameful to condemn a man so innocent! Socrates asked if his friends would think it less shameful if he were guilty.
('8', 486, 4, 19, 1154022) Here was a man who, abandoning all speculations as regards the material world, fearlessly taught that the proper study of mankind was man, was derided, reviled and then condemned to undergo the extreme penalty of the law.
('8', 486, 4, 20, 1154244) The law of conscience was accounted nothing in those days as it is still considered of little account in reference to human laws and administrative enactments, under our present forms of civilized government.
('8', 486, 4, 21, 1154453) The Delphic Oracle pronounced Socrates the wisest of men.
('8', 486, 4, 22, 1154511) To this he made a characteristic declaration: Whereas other men thought they knew something, he alone had attained to this element of true knowledge, he knew that he knew nothing.
('8', 486, 5, 23, 1154691) Passive resistance is emphatically submission to physical force under protest.
('8', 486, 5, 24, 1154770) Resist not evil, said Jesus of Nazareth, and Socrates, by drinking the poison, refrained from resisting what he had adjudged in his own mind as evil.
('8', 486, 5, 25, 1154920) How far this consorts with the philosophy of Plato, another brilliant heathen sage, will be apparent from the following prophetic picture of the Man of Sorrows whom the western world has defined:
('8', 486, 6, 26, 1155116) A man perfectly good, virtuous and just; not one who wishes to appear so before his fellows, but one who is really and sincerely so.
('8', 486, 6, 27, 1155249) We strip him of his good name .
('8', 486, 6, 28, 1155281) deprive him of everything except his intrinsic goodness.
('8', 486, 6, 29, 1155338) Without doing wrong, we will suppose him to be accounted an evil doer, that his virtue may be tried so as by fire.
('8', 486, 6, 30, 1155453) Neither infamy nor ill usage, neither
('8', 487, 0, 1, 1155491) 488 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 487, 1, 2, 1155533) poverty nor distress, neither the malignity of persecution nor the pain of cruel torture can make him swerve from the path of duty.
('8', 487, 1, 3, 1155665) Death stares him in the face, but he remains unshaken; branded as a sinner, he is still a saint .
('8', 487, 1, 4, 1155763) To complete the picture, we will suppose this godly man to be beaten with bats, scourged with whips, put to the torture, laden with chains, nailed to a cross, numbered with transgressors, and yet without sin.
('8', 487, 2, 5, 1155972) Plato wrote thus, three centuries before the advent of Christ.
('8', 487, 2, 6, 1156035) His further definition of a modern passive resister is almost inspired:
('8', 487, 3, 7, 1156107) A bad man is wretched amidst every earthly advantage; a good mantroubled on every side, yet not distressed; perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed.
('8', 487, 4, 8, 1156306) Most men of our day account Count Tolstoy a paradox.
('8', 487, 4, 9, 1156359) By common admission, however, he is a great thinker, if not quite a seer.
('8', 487, 4, 10, 1156433) He has certainly probed into the deeps of humanity.
('8', 487, 4, 11, 1156485) He has laid bare many of the human follies and foibles.
('8', 487, 4, 12, 1156541) Upon war as upon capital punishment, he looks with the deepest horror.
('8', 487, 4, 13, 1156612) An extremist he may be, yet he is a realista rationalist.
('8', 487, 4, 14, 1156670) Passive resistance is almost a fetish with him.
('8', 487, 5, 15, 1156718) We can suffer, we might not break the law.
('8', 487, 5, 16, 1156761) Men do far more harm and inflict far more injury on one another by attempting to prevent evil by violence than if they endured evil patiently.
('8', 487, 5, 17, 1156904) Besides, have you ever considered that it is only by suffering pain, torture, misery and death that you are able to convert men?
('8', 487, 5, 18, 1157033) Do you think Christianity made its way in the world by preaching?
('8', 487, 5, 19, 1157099) No such thing.
('8', 487, 5, 20, 1157114) No one was ever converted by preaching.
('8', 487, 5, 21, 1157154) What converts men is not preaching but martyrdom.
('8', 487, 5, 22, 1157204) It is only when men see other menweak, sensitive, comfort loving men like themselvestaking joyfully the spoiling of their goods, rejoicing in persecution, and going gladly to death for their faith, that they begin to believe there is something in it.
('8', 487, 5, 23, 1157455) No one ever believes in the truth of anything till he sees that someone is willing to die for it.
('8', 487, 5, 24, 1157553) The prison, the stake, the gallowsthese are the great arguments which convince men.
('8', 487, 5, 25, 1157637) And if you refuse to submit to these punishments, you destroy your only chance of converting men to your faith.
('8', 487, 6, 26, 1157749) Count Tolstoy explicitly lays it down that all punishments are in their nature persecution.
('8', 487, 7, 27, 1157841) If you say a man is a trouble and a nuisance to his neighbours, remember that the best of men have been so regarded.
('8', 487, 7, 28, 1157958) Do you think that Christ was not considered as a great nuisance and a trouble by his brothers?
('8', 487, 7, 29, 1158053) The household went on quietly until he began to make a stir.
('8', 487, 8, 30, 1158114) Tolstoy and Thoreau appear to agree in the matter of civil disobedience: they seem to be at one in regard to the claim of conscience on the individual soul.
('8', 487, 8, 31, 1158271) Yet far be it from me to claim human perfection for either of them: they are merely men of advanced thought in the domain of reason; their intellectual pre eminence claims respect from us for their ideas.
('8', 487, 8, 32, 1158476) Tolstoy holds peculiar views with regard to
('8', 488, 0, 1, 1158520) VOL. 8 : 14 DECEMBER, 1907 22 JULY, 1908 489
('8', 488, 1, 2, 1158565) Christianity.
('8', 488, 1, 3, 1158579) There is much in them which we may discard as inconsistent with his own writings.
('8', 488, 1, 4, 1158661) Still we must admit that there is wisdom in most things he has said.
('8', 488, 1, 5, 1158730) Christianity to him is a broad humanitarianism: Christ a supreme Rationalist; he subordinated everything to the inner light the light that is in you that is, the light of reason.
('8', 488, 1, 6, 1158909) This is the deduction upon which all philosophers and moralists base their passive resistance to constituted authoritythe conflict of reason with the surrender of conscience.
('8', 488, 2, 7, 1159084) I think I have now made it clear that passive resistance, as an honourable weapon in extremis to those who are subject to physical force, has high, if not divine, sanction for its exercise.
('8', 488, 2, 8, 1159274) Its ethics in governments and communities of men are plain and unmistakable.
('8', 488, 2, 9, 1159351) I have referred to Socrates and Plato, to Christ and to modern morality.
('8', 488, 2, 10, 1159424) Going further back to antiquity we find Confucius indicating in his moral code the dividing line between active disobedience and passive resistance in simple and homely words:
('8', 488, 3, 11, 1159600) At first my way with men was to hear their words and give them credit for their conduct.
('8', 488, 3, 12, 1159689) Now my way is to hear their words and look at their conduct.
('8', 488, 3, 13, 1159750) To see what is right and not to do it is want of courage.
('8', 488, 4, 14, 1159808) I will conclude in the words of Macaulay, so eloquent and so pregnant with meaning:
('8', 488, 5, 15, 1159892) The sceptre may pass away from us.
('8', 488, 5, 16, 1159927) Unforeseen accidents may derange our most profound schemes of policy.

('8', 488, 5, 18, 1160036) But there are triumphs which are followed by no reverse.
('8', 488, 5, 19, 1160093) There is an empire exempt from all natural causes of decay.
('8', 488, 5, 20, 1160153) Those triumphs are the pacific triumphs of reason over barbarism; that empire is the imperishable empire of our arts and our morals, our literature and our laws.
('8', 488, 5, 21, 1160315) But let not us, mistaking her character and her interests, fight the battle of truth with the weapons of error and endeavour to support by oppression that religion which first taught the human race the great lesson of universal charity.

('8', 488, 8, 26, 1160743) Below are some interesting facts from it.
('8', 488, 9, 27, 1160785) The revenues of the department for the year 1907 exceeded those for 1906 by 178.4.8. Revenues from embarkation pass fees increased by 58 [during the same period].
('8', 488, 9, 28, 1160948) While other departments have to be financed by the Government, the Immigration Department pays its way.
('8', 488, 10, 29, 1161052) During the year under review, 27,522 passengers arrived, of whom 15,958 were British, 2,262 Chinese and 8,171 Indians.

('8', 489, 1, 3, 1161311) In all 5,206 were detained [for verification of claims].
('8', 489, 1, 4, 1161368) Of these 323 were Arabs, 256 Chinese, 2,459 Indians, 317 Sinhalese and 1,407 from Zanzibar, other miscellaneous groups accounting for the rest.
('8', 489, 1, 5, 1161512) While in 1906 nine certificates were issued to persons who passed the education test, 59 such certificates were issued in 1907.
('8', 489, 2, 6, 1161640) A total of 11,425 domicile certificates was issued in 1906 and 12,483 in 1907. Seventy nine certificates were confiscated as they were found to be in possession of persons other than those to whom they were issued.
('8', 489, 2, 7, 1161855) Of those who were detained [for the verification of their claims] four personsone white and three Asiatic escaped.
('8', 489, 2, 8, 1161970) The white was later apprehended and sent back.
('8', 489, 2, 9, 1162017) From among thosewere detained, although they had passes, 12 escaped.
('8', 489, 2, 10, 1162086) In all 16 persons, some of whom were notorious white criminals or women of ill repute, were deported.

('8', 489, 6, 19, 1162741) The following resolutions were passed at the mass meeting:
('8', 489, 7, 20, 1162800) RESOLUTION I
('8', 489, 8, 21, 1162813) This Mass Meeting of British Indians domiciled in the Transvaal deplores the fact that the Government intend to depart from the spirit of the compromise entered into by them with the Asiatic communities of the Transvaal last January, in that they make it a condition of repeal of the Asiatic Law Amendment Act that rights of certain Asiatics domiciled in the Transvaal before the War are surrendered, and that the Asiatic communities should consent to an insult being offered to Asiatics of educational attainments.
('8', 489, 9, 22, 1163329) This resolution was proposed by Moulvi Ahmed Mukhtar.
('8', 489, 10, 23, 1163383) RESOLUTION 2
('8', 489, 11, 24, 1163396) By reason of the decision of the Government not to carry out their part of the compromise, and regard being had to the fact that the Asiatics in the Transvaal have, almost without exception, made application for voluntary registration, this Mass Meeting hereby resolves to withdraw all the applications so made, and reaffirms the

('8', 490, 1, 2, 1163771) solemn declaration made on the 11th day of September, 1906, not to submit to the Asiatic Law Amendment Act, but to suffer, as loyal citizens and conscientious men, all the penalties consequent upon non submission thereto.
('8', 490, 2, 3, 1163993) This was proposed by Imam Abdool Cadir Bawazeer.
('8', 490, 3, 4, 1164042) RESOLUTION 3
('8', 490, 4, 5, 1164055) This Mass Meeting tenders its respectful thanks to all those, whether in South Africa, England, or India, who have helped and sympathized with the British Indian Community of the Transvaal during its struggle for legitimate freedom and to retain its self respect, and earnestly trusts that they will continue to assist with their sympathy and support until justice is fully vindicated.
('8', 490, 5, 6, 1164441) RESOLUTION 4
('8', 490, 6, 7, 1164454) This Mass Meeting hereby authorizes and instructs the Chairman of the British Indian Association to forward copies of the preceding resolutions to the Honble the Colonial Secretary, and to His Excellency the Governor of the Transvaal, for transmission to the Imperial Secretaries of State for the Colonies and India.

('8', 491, 4, 6, 1166551) Owing to the large number of applicants and the necessity of dealing with their applications in different batches, the Vereeniging applications, among which is that of the applicant, have only lately been taken in hand.
('8', 491, 5, 7, 1166771) 15: The Petitioners Registration Certificate had already been signed before he filed the Petition in this matter and in the ordinary course would (together with the documents which accompanied his application) be delivered to him within about seven days from this day by a responsible officer instructed to see that the papers got into the hands of the right person.

('8', 492, 7, 11, 1168899) J. J. DOKES LETTER TO THE TRANSVAAL LEADER [July 4, 1908] [THE EDITOR THE TRANSVAAL LEADER
('8', 492, 9, 12, 1168990) We all deplore the reappearance of the Asiatic difficulty.
('8', 492, 9, 13, 1169049) When passive resistance came to an end five months ago, we earnestly hoped that the trouble would never recur in such a form.
('8', 492, 9, 14, 1169175) It dislocated trade; it filled our prisons with men who, as General Smuts said, were not criminals, it embarrassed the Government, and made us all feel extremely wretched.
('8', 492, 9, 15, 1169347) The resuscitation of this would be indeed a calamity.
('8', 492, 9, 16, 1169401) We still hope it may be averted.
('8', 492, 9, 17, 1169434) It behoves us to work for this end, with both hands earnestly.
('8', 492, 9, 18, 1169497) But at present the outlook is very serious, and those who should know best say passive resistance is once more inevitable.
('8', 492, 10, 19, 1169620) My apology for writing is that I have some knowledge of the subject as it appears from the Asiatic point of view, and that a re statement of it may be of some value at this crisis.
('8', 492, 11, 20, 1169801) The Colonial Secretary has at last agreed to repeal the objectionable Asiatic Law Amendment Act.
('8', 492, 11, 21, 1169898) This, I believe, is inevitable to any just and hopeful settlement.
('8', 492, 11, 22, 1169965) When the compromise was being effected, circumstances placed me at the very focus of the trouble, and I am convinced from personal knowledge that the Asiatics did not doubt that the repeal of the Act was an essential part of the agreement.
('8', 492, 11, 23, 1170205) The Colonial
('8', 493, 0, 1, 1170218) 494 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('8', 493, 1, 2, 1170260) Secretary himself fostered this conviction in his speech 1 at Richmond, published in the Press of February 6, when he said: He had told them (i.e., the Asiatics) that the law would not be repealed so long as there was an Asiatic in the country who had not registered.
('8', 493, 1, 3, 1170528) And again: Until every Indian in the country had registered the law would not be repealed.
('8', 493, 1, 4, 1170619) This prospective repeal was thus evidently made an incentive to obtain the registration of all the Asiatics.
('8', 493, 1, 5, 1170728) This is simply to show that these men had good ground for believing what is now so emphatically denied.
('8', 493, 1, 6, 1170832) But the Colonial Secretary has now agreed to repeal the Act[;] only unfortunately in offering this concession, he has attached conditions to it which the Asiatics deem themselves unable to accept.
('8', 493, 1, 7, 1171029) These conditions are new to the subject.
('8', 493, 1, 8, 1171070) The idea has apparently been promulgated that the Asiatics have brought forward new claims.
('8', 493, 1, 9, 1171162) This is untrue.
('8', 493, 1, 10, 1171178) The conditions insisted on by General Smuts are new claims, not one of them having been contemplated in the compromise.
('8', 493, 2, 11, 1171298) Briefly, they amounted to this:
('8', 493, 3, 12, 1171330) (1) That the Immigration Restriction Act shall not be regarded as applying to Asiatics in respect of admitting educated men to residence here.
('8', 493, 3, 13, 1171473) This has always been the interpretation which General Smuts has given to this Act.
('8', 493, 3, 14, 1171556) He has said repeatedly: It is a law that completely and finally shuts the door from India. The Asiatic leaders have never accepted his interpretation, but they have always professed themselves willing to accept this very drastic Act according to its interpretation by the Supreme Court.
('8', 493, 3, 15, 1171843) And their position is unchanged.
('8', 493, 3, 16, 1171876) But now apparently, not being quite sure that his reading is the right one, General Smuts requires the Asiatic leaders to accept an amendment of this Immigration Restriction Act, incorporating his interpretation of it.
('8', 493, 3, 17, 1172095) The effect would be that they would consent to the exclusion of the most cultured of their brethren from entering the Colony, though they might be able to pass the most vigorous educational test enforced by the Act.
('8', 493, 3, 18, 1172311) The Asiatics reply: You cannot expect us to accept this new amendment.
('8', 493, 3, 19, 1172382) We have not understood the Act in the sense you have given to it, but we may be wrong.
('8', 493, 3, 20, 1172469) We are willing to stand or fall by the decision of the Supreme Court; only do not force us to decide the matter ourselves. But General Smuts answers, in effect: You must take my interpretation or have no repeal!
('8', 493, 4, 21, 1172681) The singular part of the whole affair is that a few weeks ago the Colonial Secretary himself granted an educated Indian full registration, at the instance of Mr. Gandhi, on this ground, among others, that he fulfilled the requirements of the Immigrants Restriction Act!
('8', 493, 5, 22, 1172951) 2. The second and third points at issue are also entirely new conditions.
('8', 493, 5, 23, 1173025) The leaders are asked to consider all Asiatics, whether in the Colony or out of it, who hold Dutch registration certificates under Law 3 of 1885, for which they paid from 3 to 25, as prohibited persons.
('8', 493, 5, 24, 1173228) Also, that all Asiatics who were residents in the Transvaal before the war, and who can prove their previous domicile in any court of law, but who had not returned to the Colony during the three months allowed by the

('8', 494, 1, 2, 1173542) compromise, and do not hold the peace preservation permits, shall be counted as prohibited persons.
('8', 494, 1, 3, 1173642) This is a distinct contravention of the compromise.
('8', 494, 1, 4, 1173694) It means that those Asiatics who have established their right to be here, through long residence, and by costly registration under the old Dutch law, shall be refused their rights, and be turned out of the Colony while the Asiatics, who were so far from home that they could not return within the three months of grace, and who probably did not know of the compromise within that time, shall be prohibited from entering the Colony, unless they have peace preservation permits.
('8', 494, 1, 5, 1174171) These measures would probably affect 600 men!
('8', 494, 2, 6, 1174217) 3. But the last new claim is perhaps the worst of all, because of the principle involved.
('8', 494, 2, 7, 1174307) General Smuts demands that all those Asiatics who have applied voluntarily for registration, but who have been, or shall be, rejected by Mr. Chamney, shall be regarded as prohibited persons, without any right of appeal from Mr. Chamneys judgment!
('8', 494, 2, 8, 1174554) Surely this is monstrous.
('8', 494, 2, 9, 1174580) A rejected Asiatic is to be allowed no right to have his case properly tried!
('8', 494, 2, 10, 1174658) He may not even know why he is rejected!
('8', 494, 2, 11, 1174699) Even Mr. Chamney is not infallible, and may blunder like the rest of us; but if the Registrar says he is not satisfied, the poor Asiatic must leave his home and go, without any right of appeal!
('8', 494, 2, 12, 1174893) This is not common humanity, and I do not wonder that the Asiatics refuse to buy the promised repeal at such a price.
('8', 494, 3, 13, 1175011) It is well to have a clear perception of the principle at stake.
('8', 494, 3, 14, 1175076) In these terms the spirit of autocracy is dominant.
('8', 494, 3, 15, 1175128) The Asiatics claim simply the interpretation and protection of the Supreme Court.
('8', 494, 3, 16, 1175210) They do not resent the Immigration Restriction Act.
('8', 494, 3, 17, 1175262) They only claim that it be not interpreted by any official, however exalted he may be, but by the recognized Court, and by that judgment they will stand.
('8', 494, 3, 18, 1175416) They do not resent the rejection of Asiatics by Mr. Chamney, and their deportation, but they claim that no official shall be made supreme.
('8', 494, 3, 19, 1175555) They ask for the right of appeal in such cases to the well balanced judgment of a properly constituted tribunal.
('8', 494, 3, 20, 1175668) It is a protest against new claims not contemplated in the compromise, and against the spirit of autocracy which dominates them.
('8', 494, 3, 21, 1175797) But surely, while these points are of supreme moment to the sufferers, they are not, after all, vital matters, so far as our Government is concerned.
('8', 494, 3, 22, 1175947) There can be no inrush of Asiatics under the stringent tests possible by enforcing the Immigration Restriction Act, and there can be no loss of prestige in acting justly.
('8', 494, 3, 23, 1176118) To these men the new conditions involve so much that I understand they are prepared to return to the position in which the compromise found them, and that passive resistance will be commenced again in a few days!
('8', 494, 3, 24, 1176331) Cannot something be done even now to effect a settlement without suffering such a calamity?
('8', 494, 3, 25, 1176423) We recognize that whatever is done must be a real settlement this time.
('8', 494, 3, 26, 1176495) I trust a patchwork will be tolerated by no one.
('8', 494, 3, 27, 1176544) But we may rest assured of this, that there will be no such thing as final settlement unless justice and good faith are alike satisfied.
