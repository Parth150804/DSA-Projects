('93', 0, 1, 2, 46) 1. TALK TO RELIEF WORKERS 1
('93', 0, 2, 3, 74) CHANDPUR, November 7, 1946
('93', 0, 3, 4, 101) GANDHIJI: What goes against my grain is that a single individual can be converted or a single woman can be kidnapped or raped.
('93', 0, 3, 5, 228) So long as we feel we can be subjected to these indignities, we shall continue to be so subjected.
('93', 0, 3, 6, 327) If we say we cannot do without police or military protection, we really confess defeat even before the battle has begun.
('93', 0, 3, 7, 448) No police or military in the world can protect people who are cowards.
('93', 0, 3, 8, 519) Today you say thousands of people are terrorizing a mere handful, so what can the latter do?
('93', 0, 3, 9, 612) But even a few individuals are enough to terrorize the whole mass, if the latter feel helpless.
('93', 0, 3, 10, 708) Your trouble is not numerical inferiority but the feeling of helplessness that has seized you and the habit of depending on others.
('93', 0, 3, 11, 840) The remedy lies with you.
('93', 0, 3, 12, 866) That is why I am opposed to the idea of your evacuating East Bengal en masse.
('93', 0, 3, 13, 944) It is no cure for impotence or helplessness.
('93', 0, 4, 14, 989) A WORKER: East Bengal is opposed to such a move.
('93', 0, 5, 15, 1038) G. They should not leave.
('93', 0, 5, 16, 1064) 20,000 able bodied men prepared to die like brave men non violently might today be regarded as a fairy tale, but it would be no fairy tale for every able bodied man in a population of 20,000 to die like stalwart soldiers in open fight.
('93', 0, 5, 17, 1300) They will go down in history like the immortal three hundred of Leonidas who made Thermopylae :
('93', 0, 6, 18, 1396) Stranger!
('93', 0, 6, 19, 1406) Tell Sparta, here her sons are laid,
('93', 0, 7, 20, 1443) Such was her law and we that law obeyed.
('93', 0, 7, 21, 1484) I will proclaim from the housetops that it is the only condi tion under which you can live in East Bengal.
('93', 0, 7, 22, 1591) You have asked for Hindu officers, Hindu police and Hindu military in the place of Muslim.
('93', 0, 7, 23, 1682) It is a false cry.
('93', 0, 7, 24, 1701) You forget that Hindu offi cers, Hindu police and Hindu military have in the past done all these thingslooting, arson, abduction, rape.
('93', 0, 7, 25, 1837) I come from Kathiawarthe land of petty principa lities.
('93', 0, 7, 26, 1893) I cannot describe to you to what depths of depravity human
('93', 0, 8, 27, 1952) 1 Extracted from Pyarelals The First Lesson.
('93', 0, 8, 28, 1997) A group of 20 to 25 workers and representatives of relief organizations had met Gandhiji in the dining saloon of the Kiwi on the morning of November 7.
('93', 1, 0, 1, 2149) 2 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('93', 1, 1, 2, 2189) nature can go.
('93', 1, 1, 3, 2204) No womans honour is safe in some principalities and the chief is no hooligan but a duly annointed one.
('93', 1, 2, 4, 2307) W. These are cases of individual depravity.
('93', 1, 2, 5, 2351) Here we have got this on a mass scale.
('93', 1, 3, 6, 2390) G. But the individual there is not alone.
('93', 1, 3, 7, 2432) He is backed by the machinery of his little State.
('93', 1, 4, 8, 2483) W. He is condemned even by his compeers.
('93', 1, 4, 9, 2524) Here such acts are not condemned by the Muslims.
('93', 1, 5, 10, 2573) G. I have heard nothing but condemnation of these acts from Shaheed Suhrawardy downwards since I have come here.
('93', 1, 5, 11, 2686) Words of condemnation may tickle your ears, but they are no consolation to the unfortunate women whose houses have been laid desolate or who have been abducted, forcibly converted and forcibly married.
('93', 1, 5, 12, 2888) What a shame for Hindus, what a disgrace for Islam!
('93', 1, 5, 13, 2940) No, I am not going to leave you in peace.
('93', 1, 5, 14, 2982) Presently you will say to your self, When will this man leave us and go? But this man will not go.
('93', 1, 5, 15, 3081) He did not come on your invitation and he will go only on his own, but with your blessings, when his mission in East Bengal is fulfilled.
('93', 1, 6, 16, 3219) A WORKER: It is a part of their plan for Pakistan.
('93', 1, 7, 17, 3270) G. It is midsummer madness and they have realized it.
('93', 1, 7, 18, 3324) They will soon sicken of it.
('93', 1, 7, 19, 3353) They have already begun to.
('93', 1, 8, 20, 3381) W. Why do not they come here then and set this right?
('93', 1, 9, 21, 3435) G. That stage will come.
('93', 1, 9, 22, 3460) Sickness only marks the crisis.
('93', 1, 9, 23, 3492) Convalescence must precede cure.
('93', 1, 9, 24, 3525) You see I am a nature curist.
('93', 1, 10, 25, 3555) A WORKER: But here we are a mere drop in the ocean.
('93', 1, 11, 26, 3607) Gandhiji replied that even if there was one Hindu in East Bengal, he wanted him to have the courage to go and live in the midst of the Mussalmans and die if he must like a hero.
('93', 1, 11, 27, 3785) He should refuse to live as a serf and a slave.
('93', 1, 11, 28, 3833) He might not have the non violent strength to die without fighting.
('93', 1, 11, 29, 3901) But he could command their admiration if he had the courage not to submit to wrong and died fighting like a man.
('93', 1, 11, 30, 4014) There is not a man, however cruel and hard hearted, but would give his admiration to a brave man.
('93', 1, 11, 31, 4112) A goonda is not the vile man he is imagined to be.
('93', 1, 11, 32, 4163) He is not without his noble traits.
('93', 1, 12, 33, 4199) W. A goonda does not understand reason.
('93', 1, 13, 34, 4239) G. But he understands bravery.
('93', 1, 13, 35, 4270) If he finds that you are braver than he, he will respect you.
('93', 1, 13, 36, 4332) You will note that for the purposes of our present discussion I have not asked you to discard the use of arms.
('93', 2, 0, 1, 4443) VOL. 93: 7 NOVEMBER, 1946 16 FEBRUARY, 1947 3
('93', 2, 1, 2, 4489) cant provide you with arms.
('93', 2, 1, 3, 4517) It is not for me to provide arms to the Chittagong Armoury Raid 1 men.
('93', 2, 1, 4, 4588) The most tragic thing about the Armoury Raid people is that they could not even multiply themselves.
('93', 2, 1, 5, 4689) Their bravery was lop sided.
('93', 2, 1, 6, 4718) It did not infect others.
('93', 2, 2, 7, 4744) A WORKER: No wonder it could not.
('93', 2, 2, 8, 4778) They were condemned.
('93', 2, 3, 9, 4799) G. By whom?
('93', 2, 3, 10, 4811) I may havethat is a different thing.
('93', 2, 4, 11, 4848) W. The people did so.
('93', 2, 4, 12, 4870) I am myself an Armoury Raid man.
('93', 2, 5, 13, 4903) G. They did not.
('93', 2, 5, 14, 4920) You are no Armoury Raid man or, you should not have been here to tell these things.
('93', 2, 5, 15, 5004) That so many of them should have remained living witnesses of the things that have happened is in my eyes a tragedy of the first order.
('93', 2, 5, 16, 5140) If they had shown the same fearlessness and courage to face death in the present crisis as they did when they made that raid, they would have gone down in history as heroes.
('93', 2, 5, 17, 5314) As it is, they have only inscribed a small footnote in the page of history.
('93', 2, 5, 18, 5390) You will see I am not, as I have already said, asking you just now to unlearn the use of arms or to follow my type of heroism.
('93', 2, 5, 19, 5517) I have not made it good even in my own case.
('93', 2, 5, 20, 5562) I have come here to test it in East Bengal.
('93', 2, 5, 21, 5606) I want you to take up the conventional type of heroism.
('93', 2, 5, 22, 5662) You should be able to infect others both men and womenwith courage and fearlessness to face death when the alternative is dishonour and humiliation.
('93', 2, 5, 23, 5811) Then the Hindus can stay in East Bengal, not otherwise.
('93', 2, 5, 24, 5867) After all, the Mussalmans are blood of our blood and bone of our bone.
('93', 2, 6, 25, 5938) W. Here the proportion of Mussalmans and Hindus is 6 to 1. How can you expect us to stand against such heavy odds?
('93', 2, 7, 26, 6053) G. When India was brought under British subjection, there were 70,000 European soldiers against 33 crores of Indians.
('93', 2, 8, 27, 6171) W. We have no arms.
('93', 2, 8, 28, 6191) The Government backs them with its bayonets.
('93', 2, 9, 29, 6236) G. The odds were much heavier against the Indians in South Africa.
('93', 2, 9, 30, 6303) The Indian community there was a mere hand ful in the midst of an overwhelming majority of Europeans and Negroes.
('93', 2, 9, 31, 6417) The Europeans had arms.
('93', 2, 9, 32, 6441) We had none.
('93', 2, 9, 33, 6454) So we forged the weapon of satyagraha.
('93', 2, 9, 34, 6493) Today the Indian is respected by the White man in South Africa, not so the Zulu with all his fine physique.
('93', 2, 10, 35, 6601) A WORKER: So we are to fight with arms anyhow?
('93', 2, 11, 36, 6648) G. Not anyhow.
('93', 2, 11, 37, 6663) Even violence has its code of ethics.
('93', 2, 12, 38, 6701) 1 Carried out by a group of terrorists on April 18, 1930
('93', 3, 0, 1, 6758) 4 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('93', 3, 1, 2, 6798) instance, to butcher helpless old men, women and children is not bravery but rank cowardice.
('93', 3, 1, 3, 6891) Chivalry requires that they should be protected even at the cost of ones life.
('93', 3, 1, 4, 6970) The history of early Islam is replete with such instances of chivalry and Islam is all the stronger for them.
('93', 3, 2, 5, 7080) W. Would you permit the Hindus to take the offensive?
('93', 3, 2, 6, 7134) G. The people of Bihar did and brought disgrace upon thems elves and India.
('93', 3, 2, 7, 7210) They have set the clock of Indias independence back.
('93', 3, 2, 8, 7263) I have a right to speak about Bihar.
('93', 3, 2, 9, 7300) In a sense I feel closer to Bihar than to Bengal as fortune enabled me to give a striking demonstration of the non violence technique in Champaran.
('93', 3, 2, 10, 7448) 1 I have heard it said that the retaliation in Bihar has cooled the Muslims down.
('93', 3, 2, 11, 7530) They mean it has cowed them down for the time being.
('93', 3, 2, 12, 7583) They forget that two can play at a game.
('93', 3, 2, 13, 7624) Bihar has forged a link in the chain of our slavery.
('93', 3, 2, 14, 7677) If the Bihar performance is repeated or if the Bihar mentality does not mend, you may note down my words in your diary: Before long India will pass under the yoke of the Big Three with one of them probably as the mandatory power.
('93', 3, 2, 15, 7907) The Independence of India is today at stake in Bengal and Bihar.
('93', 3, 2, 16, 7972) The British Government entrusted the Congress with power not because they are in love with the Congress but because they had faith that the Congress would use it wisely and well, not abuse it.
('93', 3, 2, 17, 8165) Today Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru finds the ground slipping from under his feet.
('93', 3, 2, 18, 8242) But he wont let that happen.
('93', 3, 2, 19, 8271) That is why he is in Bihar.
('93', 3, 2, 20, 8299) He has said he is going to stay there as long as it may be necessary.
('93', 3, 2, 21, 8369) Biharis have behaved as cowards.
('93', 3, 2, 22, 8402) Use your arms well, if you must.
('93', 3, 2, 23, 8435) Do not ill use them.
('93', 3, 2, 24, 8456) Bihar has not used its arms well.
('93', 3, 2, 25, 8490) If the Biharis wanted to retaliate, they could have gone to Noakhali and died to a man.
('93', 3, 2, 26, 8578) But for a thousand Hindus to fall upon a handful of Mussalmansmen, women and children living in their midst is no retaliation but just brutality.
('93', 3, 2, 27, 8724) It is the privilege of arms to protect the weak and helpless.
('93', 3, 2, 28, 8786) The best succour that Bihar could have given to the Hindus of East Bengal would have been to guarantee with their own lives the absolute safety of the Muslim population living in their midst.
('93', 3, 2, 29, 8978) Their example would have told.
('93', 3, 2, 30, 9009) And I have faith that they will still do so with due repentance when the present madness has passed away.
('93', 3, 2, 31, 9115) Anyway that is the price I have put upon my life if they want me to live.
('93', 3, 2, 32, 9189) Here ends the first lesson.

('93', 4, 1, 2, 9292) 2. DISCUSSION WITH MUSLIM LEAGUE LEADERS 1
('93', 4, 2, 3, 9335) CHANDPUR, November 7, 1946
('93', 4, 3, 4, 9362) One of them remarked that no disturbances had taken place in Chandpur sub division.
('93', 4, 3, 5, 9446) The rush of refugees to Chandpur was due to panic caused by false Press propaganda.
('93', 4, 3, 6, 9530) The number of Hindus killed by the Muslims was only 15 while double that number of Muslims had died as a result of firing by the military who were mostly Hindus.
('93', 4, 4, 7, 9692) Another member of the deputation who was an M. L. A. was even more bitter about the fact that the Hindus were still evacuating and their rehabilitation was being obstructed by the Hindu workers who encouraged them to migrate in order to discredit the Muslim League Government and paralyse the administration.
('93', 4, 5, 8, 10001) Shamsuddin Saheb who was present at the meeting along with Nasrullah Saheb 2 and Abdul Rashid Saheb interposed that it was no use isolating Chandpur sub division and ignoring what had taken place elsewhere in the district.
('93', 4, 5, 9, 10224) Equally irrelevant to their present argument was their reference to the military firing.
('93', 4, 6, 10, 10313) When they had finished, Gandhiji replying remarked that if what they had said was to be taken at its face value, then it amounted to this: that the Muslims had committed no excesses.
('93', 4, 6, 11, 10496) The mischief had all been provok ed by the excesses of the police and the military who were harassing the Mussalmans and it was they, therefore, who together with the panic monger ing Hindus were the real culprits.
('93', 4, 6, 12, 10711) That was too big a pill for anybody to swallow.
('93', 4, 6, 13, 10759) Why had it become necessary to call the military, if no disturbances had taken place?
('93', 4, 6, 14, 10845) A deputation of 20 to 25 Hindus had a meeting with him in the morning.
('93', 4, 6, 15, 10916) 3 They had told him awful tales of what had happened in Tippera and Noakhali.
('93', 4, 6, 16, 10994) Similar tales had been pouring into his ears ever since he had set foot in Bengal.
('93', 4, 6, 17, 11077) Even Muslim Leaguers had admitted that terrible things had been done.
('93', 4, 6, 18, 11147) They disputed the figures which they feared were exaggerated.
('93', 4, 6, 19, 11209) He was not concerned with numbers.
('93', 4, 6, 20, 11244) Even if there was a single case of abduction, forcible conversion or forcible marriage, it was enough to make every godfearing man or woman hang down his or her head in shame.
('93', 4, 7, 21, 11420) He was not going to keep anything secret, Gandhiji proceeded.
('93', 4, 7, 22, 11482) He would place all the information which he might receive before the Ministers.
('93', 4, 7, 23, 11562) He had come to
('93', 4, 8, 24, 11577) 1 Extracted from Pyarelals Overproof is Admission.
('93', 4, 8, 25, 11628) Several prominent Muslim League leaders of Tippera District met Gandhiji at Chandpur on board the Kiwi before he left for Chaumuhani.
('93', 4, 8, 26, 11762) 2 K. Nasrullah, M. L. A. and Parliamentary Secretary in the Home Department of the Muslim League Ministry in Bengal 3 Vide the preceding item.
('93', 5, 0, 1, 11905) 6 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('93', 5, 1, 2, 11945) promote mutual goodwill and confidence.
('93', 5, 1, 3, 11985) In that he wanted their help.
('93', 5, 1, 4, 12015) He did not want peace to be established with the help of the police and the military.
('93', 5, 1, 5, 12101) An imposed peace was no peace.
('93', 5, 1, 6, 12132) He did not wish to encourage people to flee from their homes in East Bengal either.
('93', 5, 1, 7, 12216) If the mass flight of the refugees had been deliberately planned to discredit the Muslim League Ministry, it would recoil on the heads of those who had done so.
('93', 5, 1, 8, 12377) To him it seemed hardly credible.
('93', 5, 1, 9, 12411) He suggested that the right course would be to make a clean breast of the matter.
('93', 5, 1, 10, 12493) It is far better to magnify your own mistake and proclaim it to the whole world than leave it to the world to point the accusing finger at you.
('93', 5, 1, 11, 12637) God never spares the evil doer.
('93', 5, 2, 12, 12669) The gentleman who had spoken first thereupon admitted that he had heard of some cases of arson and looting but the looting had taken place after the occupants had fled.
('93', 5, 2, 13, 12838) The deserted houses offered too strong a temptation to the hooligans.
('93', 5, 3, 14, 12908) GANDHIJI: But why should people flee from their homes?
('93', 5, 3, 15, 12963) People do not do so normally.
('93', 5, 3, 16, 12993) Everybody knows that an unoccupied and unprotected house is bound to be looted by someone or the other.
('93', 5, 3, 17, 13097) Would anyone risk the loss of all he owns just to discredit the League?
('93', 5, 4, 18, 13169) Still another member of the deputation remarked that only one per cent of the people had indulged in acts of hooliganism.
('93', 5, 4, 19, 13291) The rest of the 99 per cent were really good people and in no way responsible for the happenings.
('93', 5, 5, 20, 13389) That was not a correct way of looking at it, Gandhiji replied.
('93', 5, 5, 21, 13452) If 99 per cent were good people and had actively disapproved of what had taken place, the one per cent would have been able to do nothing and could easily have been brought to book.
('93', 5, 5, 22, 13634) Good people ought actively to combat the evil, to entitle them to that name.
('93', 5, 5, 23, 13711) Sitting on the fence was no good.
('93', 5, 5, 24, 13745) If they did not mean it, they should say so and openly tell all the Hindus in the Muslim majority areas to quit.
('93', 5, 5, 25, 13858) But that was not their position as he understood it.
('93', 5, 5, 26, 13911) The Qaid e Azam had said that the minorities in Pakistan would get unadulterated justice.
('93', 5, 5, 27, 14001) Where was that justice?
('93', 5, 5, 28, 14025) Today the Hindus asked him if Noakhali was an indication of what they were to expect in Pakistan.
('93', 5, 5, 29, 14123) He had studied Islam.
('93', 5, 5, 30, 14145) His Muslim friends in South Africa used to say to him: Why not recite the Kalama and forget Hinduism? He used to say in reply that he would gladly recite the Kalama but forget Hinduism never.
('93', 5, 5, 31, 14337) His respect and regard for Hazrat Mohammed was not less than theirs.
('93', 5, 5, 32, 14406) But authoritarianism and compulsion was the way to corrupt religion, not to advance it.
('93', 5, 6, 33, 14494) Shamsuddin Saheb agreeing with Gandhiji quoted a verse from the Koran to the effect that there can be no compulsion in religion.
('93', 5, 6, 34, 14623) He had told the Mussalmans, he said, that if they wanted Pakistan they must mete out justice to the minority community and win its confidence.
('93', 5, 6, 35, 14766) By doing what you have done, you have killed Pakistan, he had told them.
('93', 6, 0, 1, 14839) VOL. 93: 7 NOVEMBER, 1946 16 FEBRUARY, 1947 7
('93', 6, 1, 2, 14885) G. Mr. McInerny, the District Magistrate of Noakhali, in a leaflet he has issued, has said that he will assume, unless the contrary is conclusively proved, that anyone who accepted Islam after the beginning of the recent disturbances was forcibly converted and in fact remained a Hindu.
('93', 6, 1, 3, 15172) If all the Muslims made that declaration, it would go a long way to settle the question.
('93', 6, 1, 4, 15261) Why should there be a public show of it, if anybody genuinely felt inclined to recite the Kalama?
('93', 6, 1, 5, 15359) A heart conversion needs no other witness than God.
('93', 6, 2, 6, 15411) Mere recitation of the Kalama while one continued to indulge in acts which are contrary to elementary decency was not Islam but a travesty of it.
('93', 6, 2, 7, 15557) That reminded him of the Plymouth Brothers 1 who had invited him to embrace Christianity because then he would be free to do anything he liked since Christ redeemed the sins of those who accepted him.
('93', 6, 2, 8, 15758) As against that there was the conclusive verse of the New Testament: Not everyone who says Lord, Lord, with his lips comes to me. 2 It was therefore up to the leaders of the Muslims to declare that forcible repetition of a formula could not make a non Muslim into a Muslim.
('93', 6, 2, 9, 16032) It only shamed Islam.
('93', 6, 3, 10, 16054) All that has happened is the result of false propaganda, argued one member of the deputation who had not hitherto spoken.
('93', 6, 4, 11, 16176) G. Let us not make a scapegoat of false propaganda.
('93', 6, 4, 12, 16228) False propaganda would fall flat if we are all right.
('93', 6, 5, 13, 16282) Finally one of the deputationists remarked that they were all prepared to go into the interior along with the Hindu leaders to restore peace and confidence but the latter distrusted them.
('93', 6, 6, 14, 16470) Gandhiji replied that that did not matter.
('93', 6, 6, 15, 16513) He would gladly accept their offer.
('93', 6, 6, 16, 16549) He said : You and I will visit every village and every home in the interior and restore peace and confidence.

('93', 7, 2, 3, 16785) LAKSHAM, November 7, 1946 I have not come on a whirlwind propaganda visit.
('93', 7, 2, 4, 16860) I have come to stay here with you as one of you.
('93', 7, 2, 5, 16909) I have no provincialism in me.
('93', 7, 2, 6, 16940) I claim to be an Indian and therefore a Bengali even as I am a Gujarati.
('93', 7, 2, 7, 17013) I have vowed to myself that I will stay on here and die here if necessary, but I will not leave Bengal till the hatchet is finally buried and even a solitary Hindu girl is not afraid to move freely about in the midst of Mussalmans.
('93', 7, 2, 8, 17245) The greatest help you can give me is to banish fear from your hearts.
('93', 7, 2, 9, 17315) And what is the talisman that can do that for you.
('93', 7, 2, 10, 17366) It is the unfailing mantra of Ramanama.
('93', 7, 2, 11, 17406) You may say, you do not believe in Him.
('93', 7, 2, 12, 17446) You do not know that but for His will you could not draw a single breath.
('93', 7, 2, 13, 17520) Call Him Ishwar, Allah, God, Ahura Mazda.
('93', 7, 2, 14, 17562) His names are as innumerable as there are men.
('93', 7, 2, 15, 17609) He is one without a second.
('93', 7, 2, 16, 17637) He alone is great.
('93', 7, 2, 17, 17656) There is none greater than He.
('93', 7, 2, 18, 17687) He is timeless, formless, stainless.
('93', 7, 2, 19, 17724) Such is my Rama.
('93', 7, 2, 20, 17741) He alone is my Lord and Master.
('93', 7, 3, 21, 17773) Gandhiji touchingly described to them how as a little boy he used to be usually timid and afraid of even shadows and how his nurse Rambha had taught him the secret of Ramanama as an antidote to fear.
('93', 7, 3, 22, 17973) When in fear, take Ramanama.
('93', 7, 3, 23, 18002) He will protect you, she used to tell him.
('93', 7, 3, 24, 18045) Ever since then Ramanama had been his unfailing refuge and shelter from all kinds of fear.
('93', 7, 4, 25, 18136) He resides in the heart of the pure always.
('93', 7, 4, 26, 18180) Tulsidas, that prince of devotees, whose name had become a household word among the Hindus from Kashmir to Cape Comorin as Shri Chaitanyas and Shri Ramakrishna Paramahansas in Bengal, had presented the message of that name to us in his immortal Ramayana.
('93', 7, 4, 27, 18435) If you walked in fear of that name, you did not need to fear any man on earth, be he a prince or a pauper.
('93', 7, 5, 28, 18542) Why should they be afraid of the cry of Allaho Akbar?
('93', 7, 5, 29, 18596) The Allah of Islam was the protector of innocence.
('93', 7, 5, 30, 18647) What had been done in East Bengal had not the sanction of Islam as preached by its Prophet.
('93', 7, 6, 31, 18739) Who could dare to dishonour their wives or daughters if they had faith in God?
('93', 7, 7, 32, 18818) 1 According to a report in Hindustan Standard, 8 11 1946, Gandhiji addressed a gathering of about 10,000 peopleHindus and Muslimswaiting from early morning at Laksham Junctionen route to Chaumuhani, which he reached shortly after midday.
('93', 8, 0, 1, 19056) VOL. 93: 7 NOVEMBER, 1946 16 FEBRUARY, 1947 9
('93', 8, 1, 2, 19102) He, therefore, expected them to cease to be afraid of Mussalmans.
('93', 8, 1, 3, 19168) If they believed in Ramanama, they must not think of leaving East Bengal.
('93', 8, 1, 4, 19242) They must live where they were born and brought up and die there if necessary, defending their honour as brave men and women.
('93', 8, 1, 5, 19368) To run away from danger instead of facing it is to deny ones faith in man and God and even ones own self.
('93', 8, 1, 6, 19474) It were better for one to drown oneself than live to declare such bankruptcy of faith.
('93', 8, 1, 7, 19561) If you ask the military, they will tell you that God is their protector.
('93', 8, 1, 8, 19634) I want you, therefore, to be able to tell Shamsuddin Saheb that you no longer need the protection of the police and the military, which may be withdrawn, but would rather put yourself under the protection of Him whose protection they all seek.
('93', 8, 2, 9, 19878) Gandhiji said that the military and the police could not give any protection.
('93', 8, 2, 10, 19956) They could ask the soldiers (who were then standing with them) whether anybody could save them in war.
('93', 8, 2, 11, 20059) Guns were unavailing before death.
('93', 8, 2, 12, 20094) It was only God who could protect.
('93', 8, 2, 13, 20129) The only way to save oneself was to rely on ones fellowmen, no matter whether they were Hindus or Muslims.
('93', 8, 2, 14, 20236) It was the gospel of love that he had come here to preach.
('93', 8, 3, 15, 20295) The Bengal Ministers and other officials were accompanying him, he added, but not to look after him.
('93', 8, 3, 16, 20396) They would help him preach and convince the people to have faith in their fellowmen and neighbours and remove fear from their minds.
('93', 8, 3, 17, 20529) Gandhiji felt convinced that the people would soon learn to dispense with the military and the police.
('93', 8, 3, 18, 20632) The sooner they could do so, he said, the better.
('93', 8, 3, 19, 20682) He would like to hear people say so from today.

('93', 8, 6, 22, 20807) CHAUMUHANI, November 7, 1946
('93', 8, 7, 23, 20836) Gandhiji told them how he had toured East Bengal in the company of the Ali Brothers during the Khilafat days.
('93', 8, 7, 24, 20946) In those days the Muslims felt that all that he said was right.
('93', 8, 7, 25, 21010) If the Ali Brothers went into a womens meeting, they went blindfolded.
('93', 8, 7, 26, 21081) He was allowed to go with his eyes open.
('93', 8, 7, 27, 21122) Why should he blindfold himself when he went
('93', 8, 8, 28, 21167) 1 What follows is from The Hindu.
('93', 8, 8, 29, 21201) 2 Extracted from Pyarelals Weekly Letter.
('93', 8, 8, 30, 21243) The meeting was held in the compound of the Hindu Vidya Mandir, a local school.
('93', 8, 8, 31, 21323) The audience was estimated at 15,000, the majority of whom were Muslims.
('93', 9, 0, 1, 21396) 10 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('93', 9, 1, 2, 21437) to his mothers and sisters?
('93', 9, 1, 3, 21465) He had no desire to go among the purdah ladies.
('93', 9, 1, 4, 21513) But the Ali Brothers insisted that he must go.
('93', 9, 1, 5, 21560) The women were eager to meet him and they were sure that his advice would do good to them.
('93', 9, 1, 6, 21651) In South Africa he had lived in the midst of Muslim friends for twenty years.
('93', 9, 1, 7, 21729) They treated him as a member of their family and told their wives and sisters that they need not observe purdah with him.
('93', 9, 1, 8, 21851) He had become a barrister in England but what was a dinner barrister worth?
('93', 9, 1, 9, 21927) It was South Africa and the struggle that he had launched there that had made him.
('93', 9, 1, 10, 22010) It was there that he discovered satyagraha and civil disobedience.
('93', 9, 2, 11, 22077) He had come to them in sadness.
('93', 9, 2, 12, 22109) What sin had Mother India committed that her children, Hindus and Muslims, were quarrelling with each other?
('93', 9, 2, 13, 22218) He had learnt that no Hindu woman was safe today in some parts of East Bengal.
('93', 9, 2, 14, 22297) Ever since he had come to Bengal, he was hearing awful tales of Muslim atrocities.
('93', 9, 2, 15, 22380) Shaheed Saheb, their Prime Minister, and Shamsuddin Saheb had admitted that there was some truth in the reports that one heard.
('93', 9, 2, 16, 22508) I have not come to excite the Hindus to fight the Mussalmans.
('93', 9, 2, 17, 22570) I have no enemies.
('93', 9, 2, 18, 22589) I have fought the British all my life.
('93', 9, 2, 19, 22628) Yet they are my friends.
('93', 9, 2, 20, 22653) I have never wished them ill.
('93', 9, 3, 21, 22683) He had heard of forcible conversions, forcible feeding of beef, abductions and forcible marriages, not to talk about murders, arson and loot.
('93', 9, 3, 22, 22825) They had broken idols.
('93', 9, 3, 23, 22848) The Muslims did not worship them nor did he.
('93', 9, 3, 24, 22893) But why should they interfere with those who wished to worship them?
('93', 9, 3, 25, 22962) These incidents are a blot on the name of Islam.
('93', 9, 3, 26, 23011) He said : I have studied the Koran.
('93', 9, 3, 27, 23047) The very word Islam means peace.
('93', 9, 3, 28, 23080) The Muslim greeting Salam Alaikum is the same for all, whether Hindus or Muslims or any other.
('93', 9, 3, 29, 23175) Nowhere does Islam allow such things as had happened in Noakhali and Tippera.
('93', 9, 3, 30, 23253) Shaheed Saheb and all the Ministers and League leaders who met me in Calcutta have condemned such acts unequivocally.
('93', 9, 3, 31, 23371) The Muslims are in such overwhelming majority in East Bengal that I expect them to constitute themselves the guardians of the small Hindu minority.
('93', 9, 3, 32, 23519) They should tell Hindu women that while they are there, no one dare cast an evil eye on them.

('93', 9, 5, 35, 23856) An interval of ten minutes was allowed to enable Muslims in the gathering to offer their prayers.

('93', 10, 6, 9, 24259) GANDHIJI: The tragedy is not that so many Muslims have gone mad, but that so many Hindus in East Bengal have been witnesses to these things.
('93', 10, 6, 10, 24400) If every Hindu in East Bengal had been done to death, I would not have minded it.
('93', 10, 6, 11, 24482) Do you know what the Rajputs did?
('93', 10, 6, 12, 24516) They killed their womenfolk when they issued forth to sacrifice themselves on the battlefield.
('93', 10, 6, 13, 24611) The surviving ones immolated them selves by mounting the funeral pyre before the fortress fell rather than allow themselves to be captured and dishonoured.
('93', 10, 6, 14, 24767) There is nothing coura geous in thousands of Mussalmans killing out a handful of Hindus in their midst, but that the Hindus should have degraded themselves by such cowardice, i.e., being witness to abduction and rape, forcible conversion and forcible marriage of their womenfolk, is heart rending.
('93', 10, 7, 15, 25065) QUESTION: How can we create a sense of security and self confidence?
('93', 10, 7, 16, 25134) By learning to die bravely.
('93', 10, 7, 17, 25162) Let us turn our wrath against ourselves.
('93', 10, 7, 18, 25203) I am not interested in getting the police substituted by the military or the Muslim police by the Hindu police.
('93', 10, 7, 19, 25315) They are broken reeds.
('93', 10, 8, 20, 25338) To whom should we appealthe Congress, the League or the British

('93', 11, 1, 2, 25673) To none of these.
('93', 11, 1, 3, 25691) Appeal to yourselves, therefore to God.
('93', 11, 2, 4, 25731) We are menmade of flesh and blood.
('93', 11, 2, 5, 25766) We need some material support.
('93', 11, 2, 6, 25797) Then appeal to your own flesh and blood.
('93', 11, 2, 7, 25838) Purify it of all dross.
('93', 11, 3, 8, 25862) A WOMAN WORKER: What is your idea of rehabilitation?
('93', 11, 4, 9, 25915) GANDHIJI: Not to send them to Assam and West Bengal but to infuse courage in them so that they are not afraid to stay in their original homes.
('93', 11, 5, 10, 26058) How is that possible?
('93', 11, 5, 11, 26080) You must stay in their midst and say to them: We shall die to the last person before a hair of your head is injured. Then you will produce heroines in East Bengal.
('93', 11, 6, 12, 26244) That was once our idea too.
('93', 11, 6, 13, 26272) I do not mind if each and every one of the 500 families in your area is done to death.
('93', 11, 6, 14, 26359) Here you are 20 per cent of the population.
('93', 11, 6, 15, 26403) In Bihar, the Muslims constitute only 14 per cent.
('93', 11, 7, 16, 26454) They know they wont be molested there.
('93', 11, 7, 17, 26493) They have been butchered in a more unsufferable manner and there have been cases of molestation of women too, this time.
('93', 11, 8, 18, 26614) If the Government do not provide rations?
('93', 11, 8, 19, 26656) There are so many relief organizations.
('93', 11, 8, 20, 26696) Rations can be purchased but honour and self respect cannot be bought.
('93', 11, 8, 21, 26767) I have a feeling that even the Bengal Government do not want this thing to go any further.
('93', 11, 8, 22, 26858) The lesson has been taught not by Bihar but the vile things done in Bengal.
('93', 11, 8, 23, 26934) They stand aghast.
('93', 11, 9, 24, 26953) You have opened up a new vista before us, Mahatmaji.
('93', 11, 9, 25, 27006) We feel fresh blood

('93', 12, 2, 3, 27201) November 8, 1946
('93', 12, 3, 4, 27218) Gandhiji told them that it was a shame for both the Hindus and the Mussalmans that the Hindus should have to run away from their homes as they had done.
('93', 12, 3, 5, 27371) It was a shame for the Muslims because it was out of fear of the Muslims that the Hindus had run away.
('93', 12, 3, 6, 27474) Why should a human being inspire another with fear?
('93', 12, 3, 7, 27526) It was no less a shame for the Hindus to have given way to craven fear.
('93', 12, 3, 8, 27598) He had always said that man should fear none but God.
('93', 12, 3, 9, 27652) The Government officials accompanying him were all anxious that they should return to their homes.
('93', 12, 3, 10, 27751) To feed and clothe thousands in one place involved difficulties for the refugees as well as for the Government.
('93', 12, 3, 11, 27863) The Government officials were ashamed of the fact that such things should have happened in their jurisdiction.
('93', 12, 3, 12, 27974) He wanted them to forgive and forget what had happened in Noakhali and Tippera.
('93', 12, 3, 13, 28054) That did not mean that they were to become cowards.
('93', 12, 3, 14, 28106) But it served no useful purpose to keep on recalling the unpleasant past.
('93', 12, 3, 15, 28180) He hoped and prayed that the Hindus and Muslims of these parts would become friends once more.
('93', 12, 3, 16, 28275) He knew the Hindus had suffered a lot and were suffering still.
('93', 12, 3, 17, 28339) He would not ask them to return to their homes till at least one good Muslim and one good Hindu came forward to accompany them and stand surety for their safety in each village.
('93', 12, 3, 18, 28517) He was sure there were plenty of good Hindus and good Muslims in these parts who would give the necessary guarantee.
('93', 12, 4, 19, 28634) A Muslim friend from the audience said, they had already given them the assurance that they would look after them but the Hindus would not listen to them.
('93', 12, 4, 20, 28789) Gandhiji replied that they should try to understand and appreciate the reasons of the Hindus distrust and overcome their fear.
('93', 12, 4, 21, 28916) A Hindu refugee got up and asked 2 how they could have confidence in the assurances of the Muslims any more.
('93', 12, 4, 22, 29025) When the trouble was threatening they had promised to look after them but had failed to protect them afterwards.
('93', 12, 4, 23, 29138) Besides, where were they to go and stay?
('93', 12, 4, 24, 29179) They had lost their all.
('93', 12, 4, 25, 29204) Were they to go back and stay in the jungles?
('93', 12, 4, 26, 29250) And when fifty good Muslims in the village had failed to save them on the previous occasion, how would one good Muslim do so now?
('93', 12, 4, 27, 29380) Moreover, miscreants were still at large roaming about in villages even after one month of the incidents.
('93', 12, 4, 28, 29486) 3 Gandhiji replied that the Government would see that
('93', 12, 5, 29, 29540) 1 Extracted from Pyarelals Weekly Letter.
('93', 12, 5, 30, 29582) Gandhiji was on his way back to Chaumuhani in the evening after a visit to Gopairbagh where, according to The Bombay Chronicle report, 19 out of the 22 male members of a family had been butchered and burnt in a corner of the compound.
('93', 12, 5, 31, 29817) At Dattapara, the house where Gandhiji halted had at the time some 6,000 refugees.
('93', 12, 5, 32, 29900) 2 According to The Bombay Chronicle, Gandhiji invited questions from the refugees.

('93', 13, 1, 3, 30160) Whatever might have happened in the past, if now one good Muslim and one good Hindu took the responsibility for their safety in each village, they could rely on their word backed as it would be by the collective invitation of all the Muslims in the village.
('93', 13, 1, 4, 30418) If they were still afraid they were cowards and not even God could help the cowardly.

('93', 13, 4, 7, 30633) One of the friends suggested that in order to restore confidence Hindu leaders should reinforce the appeals of the Muslims to the refugees to go back to their villages.
('93', 13, 4, 8, 30802) Gandhiji replied that that was not the right way to dispel the apprehension and distrust of the Hindus which was well grounded.
('93', 13, 4, 9, 30930) He would not be able to advise them to return to their homes unless there was at least one good Hindu and one good Mussalman for each village who would stand guarantee for their safety and security and who would be prepared to immolate himself before a hair of their head was touched.
('93', 13, 4, 10, 31215) It was for the Muslim League leaders who were also members of the Government to say whether such men would be forthcoming.
('93', 13, 4, 11, 31338) There was no other way to restore confidence after all that had happened.
('93', 13, 4, 12, 31412) They all agreed with Gandhijis suggestion and said that they would do their best to give effect to it.

('93', 14, 8, 14, 32683) MANILAL, Do not worry on hearing about my fast, rather rejoice.
('93', 14, 8, 15, 32747) When somebody does his duty, instead of worrying one should feel greater zeal in doing ones own work.
('93', 14, 8, 16, 32849) I am on a partial fast but am able to do my work as usual.
('93', 14, 8, 17, 32908) Let us see when the total fast begins.
('93', 14, 8, 18, 32947) That is in the hands of the Biharis.
('93', 14, 8, 19, 32984) Rajendra Babu and the others have gone there.
('93', 14, 8, 20, 33030) There are hopes that they will succeed in their mission.
('93', 14, 8, 21, 33087) Whatever happens, should I not do my duty as I understand it?

('93', 15, 2, 3, 33421) CHAUMUHANI, November 9, 1946
('93', 15, 3, 4, 33450) Two telegrams from Patna reprove me on my threatened fast.
('93', 15, 3, 5, 33509) Threatened is the word used in one of the wires.
('93', 15, 3, 6, 33558) My proposed fast is not meant to coerce anyone; it is meant to quicken the dead conscience into life.
('93', 15, 3, 7, 33660) Those who act from fear harm themselves and the cause they profess to serve.
('93', 15, 3, 8, 33737) Surely, it is as plain as A. B. C. that the action of the Biharis in injuring the very small minority of Muslims in Bihar must postpone the day of Indias independence and ultimately sour Muslims all over India unless Bihar repents her folly of senseless and cowardly violence.
('93', 15, 3, 9, 34014) Rashtrapati Acharya Kripalani, whom every Bihari knows for his sterling services, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Dr. Rajendra Prasad and now Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and Shri Jayaprakash Narayan are now in Bihar and expect to show fair Bihar that their terrible ill treatment of the Muslims is communalism of the worst type and is calculated to defeat the growing nationalism of Bihar.
('93', 15, 3, 10, 34393) I, therefore, warn everyone from abusing my contemplated fast which is in no way intended to deflect anyone from what he believes is the course of duty for him.

('93', 15, 6, 15, 34717) And the Qaid e Azams statement 1 given to the representative of the Globe which I saw in the Morning News of November 10, has rendered it even more difficult.
('93', 15, 6, 16, 34876) In the beginning it uses the expression caste Hindu, later followed by the word Hindu.
('93', 15, 6, 17, 34963) Is co operation between Hindus and Muslims an utter impossibility?
('93', 15, 6, 18, 35030) If it is so, what will be the plight of Bengal and Hindustan?

('93', 16, 1, 2, 35215) Tippera?
('93', 16, 1, 3, 35224) The refugees here do not get even half their rations and the rice they get is unfit for consumption.
('93', 16, 1, 4, 35325) They have nothing to cover themselves with during winter.
('93', 16, 1, 5, 35383) Their houses are damaged, the sanitation is unsatisfactory.
('93', 16, 1, 6, 35443) Satis Babu has prepared a report which I am sending you.
('93', 16, 1, 7, 35500) The officials here are fully co operating with me for which I am grateful to you as well as to them.
('93', 16, 1, 8, 35601) But is it not our task to settle the differences and turn both the communities into mutual friends?

('93', 16, 3, 10, 35719) 14. SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING 1
('93', 16, 4, 11, 35750) DATTAPARA, November 10, 1946 Whether you believe me or not, I want to assure you that I am a servant of both the Hindus and the Mussalmans.
('93', 16, 4, 12, 35890) I have not come here to fight Pakistan.
('93', 16, 4, 13, 35930) If India is destined to be partitioned, I cannot prevent it.
('93', 16, 4, 14, 35991) But I wish to tell you that Pakistan cannot be established by force.
('93', 16, 4, 15, 36060) In the bhajan that was just sung the poet has likened God to the philosophers stone.
('93', 16, 4, 16, 36145) The proverbial philosophers stone is said to turn iron into gold.
('93', 16, 4, 17, 36211) That is not always desirable.
('93', 16, 4, 18, 36241) For instance, if all the rails of the railway track were turned into gold by the touch of the stone, the trains would not be able to run over them.
('93', 16, 4, 19, 36389) But the touch of God purifies the soul.
('93', 16, 4, 20, 36429) That is always desirable.
('93', 16, 4, 21, 36455) That philosophers stone is within us all.
('93', 16, 4, 22, 36497) All that I wish to tell my Muslim brethren is that, whether they live as one people or two, they should live as friends with the Hindus.
('93', 16, 4, 23, 36634) If they do not wish to do so, they should say so plainly.
('93', 16, 4, 24, 36692) I would in that case confess myself defeated.
('93', 16, 4, 25, 36738) The refugees cannot stay on as refugees for ever.
('93', 16, 4, 26, 36788) The Government cannot go on feeding them.
('93', 16, 4, 27, 36830) And what sort of feed are they getting?
('93', 16, 4, 28, 36870) Less than half the daily ration of cereals to keep an able bodied man alive, no fish, no vegetables, nor anything else to
('93', 16, 5, 29, 36992) 1 This appeared under the title An Appeal to Conscience as reported by Pyarelal.
('93', 17, 0, 1, 37073) 18 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('93', 17, 1, 2, 37114) supplement it.
('93', 17, 1, 3, 37129) It is not possible for them to exist like this for any length of time.
('93', 17, 1, 4, 37200) If, therefore, the Muslims do not want them back in their villages, they must go elsewhere.
('93', 17, 1, 5, 37292) But even if every Hindu of East Bengal went away, I will still continue to live amidst the Muslims of East Bengal and eat what they give me and what I consider lawful for me to partake of.
('93', 17, 1, 6, 37481) I will not bring my food from outside.
('93', 17, 1, 7, 37520) I do not need fish or flesh.
('93', 17, 1, 8, 37549) All that I need is a little fruit, vegetables and some goats milk.
('93', 17, 1, 9, 37616) As far as goats milk and cereals are concerned, I would take them again only when it pleases God that I should do so.
('93', 17, 1, 10, 37734) I have given it up and would not resume it till the Hindus are really penitent of what they have done in Bihar.
('93', 17, 1, 11, 37846) For a thousand Hindus to surround a hundred Mussalmans or for a thousand Mussalmans to surround a hundred Hindus and oppress them is not bravery but cowardice.
('93', 17, 1, 12, 38006) Fair fight means even numbers and previous notice.
('93', 17, 1, 13, 38057) That does not mean that I approve of their fighting.
('93', 17, 1, 14, 38110) It has been said that the Hindus and Mussalmans cannot stay together as friends or co operate with each other.
('93', 17, 1, 15, 38221) No one can make me believe that, but if that is your belief, you should say so.
('93', 17, 1, 16, 38301) I would in that case not ask the Hindus to return to their homes.
('93', 17, 1, 17, 38367) They would leave East Bengal, and it would be a shame for both the Mussalmans and the Hindus.
('93', 17, 1, 18, 38461) If, on the other hand, you want the Hindus to stay in your midst, you should tell them that they need not look to the military for protection but to their Muslim brethren instead.
('93', 17, 1, 19, 38641) Their daughters and sisters and mothers are your own daughters, sisters and mothers and you should protect them with your lives.
('93', 17, 1, 20, 38770) I addressed them in the refugee camp yesterday.
('93', 17, 1, 21, 38818) The District Magistrate, Mr. McInerny, told them that all mankind being descended from Adam and Eve, they were all members of one familyrelatives, whatever their race or religion.
('93', 17, 1, 22, 38998) So they should live together as relatives.
('93', 17, 1, 23, 39041) One man is said to have returned to his village last evening after the prayer meeting.
('93', 17, 1, 24, 39128) He found his house surrounded by Muslims.
('93', 17, 1, 25, 39170) They would not let him take his property.
('93', 17, 1, 26, 39212) How can I, under these circumstances (if they are true), ask anyone to go back?
('93', 17, 1, 27, 39292) You should ponder over what I have said and let me know what you really wish.
('93', 17, 1, 28, 39370) I shall advise the Hindus accordingly.
('93', 17, 1, 29, 39409) I am told and I believe that there are many good Muslims who

('93', 18, 1, 2, 39517) would welcome the Hindus back but the goondas stand in the way.
('93', 18, 1, 3, 39581) I wish to tell you that if the good Muslims spoke out with one voice and acted according to their professions, the so called goondas would become ineffective and would mend their ways.

('93', 18, 3, 15, 40349) Better read good books, reflect on them and write on them.

('93', 18, 6, 21, 40631) DATTAPARA, November 11, 1946
('93', 18, 7, 22, 40660) Gandhiji poured out the anguish which the sights which he had seen had filled him with.
('93', 18, 7, 23, 40748) Wherever he had gone, he had seen burnt houses and heard stories of looting and forcible conversions.
('93', 18, 7, 24, 40850) Hindu women were without the auspicious vermilion mark on their heads and foreheads and without their conch shell bangles.
('93', 18, 7, 25, 40973) How he wished that all Muslim brothers would condemn these atrocities with one voice so that the Hindus could go back to their homes and live there as they used to before the disturbances.
('93', 18, 7, 26, 41162) Their houses would be rebuilt before they could go back.
('93', 18, 7, 27, 41219) The Muslims should help in that.
('93', 18, 7, 28, 41252) Such he believed was the injunction of the holy Koran too.

('93', 21, 5, 12, 45225) I am suggesting that each coworker should be put in a different village.
('93', 21, 5, 13, 45298) What would be the good of sending for you?
('93', 21, 5, 14, 45341) In fact, they should all be Bengalis.
('93', 21, 5, 15, 45379) First I have to see about those who are with me.

('93', 22, 5, 15, 46681) How are you now?

('93', 22, 8, 28, 47172) DATTAPARA, November 12, 1946
('93', 22, 9, 29, 47201) Gandhiji again referred to the question of repatriation.
('93', 22, 9, 30, 47258) The Moulvi Saheb, the Vice President of Union No.
('93', 22, 9, 31, 47308) 6, who had addressed them before him had invited them in the name of the Mussalmans to return to their homes.
('93', 22, 9, 32, 47418) But it was not so easy in action as it was in speech.
('93', 22, 9, 33, 47472) Everyone was anxious to see the two communities live in

('93', 23, 1, 2, 47695) peace and harmony once again.
('93', 23, 1, 3, 47725) For that it was not necessary that they should have the same religion.
('93', 23, 1, 4, 47796) He had seen awful sights of destruction.
('93', 23, 1, 5, 47837) He had seen the terror stricken faces of the sufferers.
('93', 23, 1, 6, 47893) They had been forcibly converted once and they were afraid the same thing would be repeated.
('93', 23, 1, 7, 47986) He wanted them to shed that fear.
('93', 23, 1, 8, 48020) He alone deserved to live who refused to give up Gods name.
('93', 23, 1, 9, 48080) 1 He remembered how during the Jallianwala Bagh days, young English lads made big, hefty men crawl on their bellies.
('93', 23, 1, 10, 48197) The lane through which they were made to crawl was called the crawling lane.
('93', 23, 1, 11, 48274) Those men had a human form but they were worse than worms.
('93', 23, 1, 12, 48333) So they must learn to be brave and face death rather than give up Ramanama.
('93', 23, 2, 13, 48409) He was not enamoured of the military and the police.
('93', 23, 2, 14, 48462) The function of the police was to arrest thieves and dacoits, that of the military to guard them against foreign aggression.
('93', 23, 2, 15, 48587) The police and the military could not teach them to cease fighting among themselves and live as friends.
('93', 23, 2, 16, 48692) He would not ask anyone to return to their homes unless one good Hindu and one good Muslim stood surety for their safety in their respective villages.
('93', 23, 2, 17, 48843) 2 He referred to the scheme for repatriation but it could work only if the Muslim League wished to have peace and fully co operated.
('93', 23, 2, 18, 48976) Shamsuddin Saheb was coming in two or three days.
('93', 23, 2, 19, 49026) They would hear from him what the League Government wanted to do.

('93', 23, 6, 25, 49458) November 13, 1946
('93', 23, 7, 26, 49476) Early in the morning Gandhiji announced to his party an important decision.
('93', 23, 7, 27, 49552) He had decided to disperse his party detailing each member, including the ladies, to settle down in one affected village and make himself or herself hostage for the safety and security of the Hindu minority of that village.
('93', 23, 7, 28, 49776) They must be pledged to protect

('93', 24, 1, 2, 50098) with their lives, if necessary, the Hindu population of that village.
('93', 24, 1, 3, 50168) His decision was not binding on anyone of his party, he said.
('93', 24, 1, 4, 50230) Those who wanted to, were free to go away and take up any of his other constructive activities.
('93', 24, 1, 5, 50326) Those who have ill will against the Mussalmans or Islam in their hearts or cannot curb their indignation at what has happened should stay away.
('93', 24, 1, 6, 50470) They will only misrepresent me by working under this plan.
('93', 24, 2, 7, 50529) So far as he was concerned, he added, his decision was final and irrevocable and left no room for discussion.
('93', 24, 2, 8, 50639) He was going to bury himself in East Bengal till the Hindus and Mussalmans learnt to live together in harmony and peace.
('93', 24, 2, 9, 50760) He would deprive himself of the services of all his companions and fend for himself with whatever assistance he could command locally.
('93', 24, 2, 10, 50895) 1 His ahimsa would be incomplete, he argued, unless he took that step.
('93', 24, 2, 11, 50966) Either ahimsa is the law of life or it is not.
('93', 24, 2, 12, 51013) A friend used to say that the Ahimsa Sutra in PatanjaliAhimsa Pratishthayam Tatsannidhau vairatyagah

('93', 24, 9, 19, 51381) was a mistake and needed to be amended and the saying Ahimsa Paramodharmah

('93', 24, 14, 24, 51635) ought to be read as Himsa Paramodharmah

('93', 24, 18, 28, 51810) ; in other words, violence, not non violence was the supreme law.
('93', 24, 18, 29, 51876) If at the crucial moment he lost faith in the law of non violence, he must accept the deceased friends amendment which appeared to him to be absurd.
('93', 24, 18, 30, 52025) Gandhiji continued : I know the women of Bengal better than probably the Bengalis do.
('93', 24, 18, 31, 52111) Today they feel crushed and helpless.
('93', 24, 18, 32, 52149) The sacrifice of myself and my companions would at least teach them the art of dying with self respect.
('93', 24, 18, 33, 52253) It might open, too, the eyes of the oppressors and melt their hearts.
('93', 24, 18, 34, 52323) I do not say that the moment my eyes are closed theirs will open.
('93', 24, 18, 35, 52389) But that will be the ultimate result, I have not the slightest doubt.
('93', 24, 18, 36, 52459) If ahimsa disappears, Hindu Dharma disappears.
('93', 24, 19, 37, 52506) The issue is not religious but political.
('93', 24, 19, 38, 52548) It is not a movement against the Hindus, but against the Congress, remarked one member of the party.
('93', 24, 20, 39, 52649) GANDHIJI: Do you not see that they think that the Congress is a purely Hindu body?
('93', 24, 20, 40, 52732) And do not forget that I have no watertight compartments such as religious, political and other.
('93', 24, 20, 41, 52829) Let us not lose ourselves in a forest of words.
('93', 24, 20, 42, 52877) How to solve the tangleviolently or non violentlyis the question.
('93', 24, 20, 43, 52943) In other words, has my method efficacy today?
('93', 24, 21, 44, 52989) 1 Pyarelal says what follows was explained by Gandhiji in the evening.
('93', 24, 21, 45, 53060) In the discussion which followed, Thakkar Bapa and Sucheta Kripalani also took part.
('93', 25, 0, 1, 53145) 26 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('93', 25, 1, 2, 53186) QUESTION: How can you reason with people who are thirsting for your blood?
('93', 25, 1, 3, 53261) Only the other day one of our workers was murdered.
('93', 25, 2, 4, 53313) GANDHIJI: I know it.
('93', 25, 2, 5, 53334) To quell the rage is our job.
('93', 25, 3, 6, 53364) Another worker asked whether it was right to invite people to return to their villages under the prevailing conditions which involved a considerable amount of risk.
('93', 25, 4, 7, 53529) Gandhijis reply was that there was no harm in asking them to return to their villages if the Muslims of that village collectively guaranteed their safety and their guarantee was backed by one good Hindu and one good Mussalman, who would stay with them in that village and protect them by laying down their lives, if necessary.
('93', 25, 4, 8, 53856) If there was that much guarantee, the refugees ought to return to their homes and face whatever risk there might be.
('93', 25, 4, 9, 53973) If they had not the courage to live on these terms, Hinduism was doomed to disappear from East Bengal.
('93', 25, 4, 10, 54076) The question of East Bengal is not one of Bengal alone.
('93', 25, 4, 11, 54132) The battle for India is today being decided in East Bengal.
('93', 25, 4, 12, 54192) Today Mussalmans are being taught by some that Hindu religion is an abomination and therefore forcible conversion of Hindus to Islam is a merit.
('93', 25, 4, 13, 54337) It would save to Islam at least the descendants of those who were forcibly converted.
('93', 25, 4, 14, 54423) If retaliation is to rule the day, the Hindus, in order to win, will have to outstrip the Mussalmans in the nefarious deeds that the latter are reported to have done.
('93', 25, 4, 15, 54590) The United Nations set out to fight Hitler with his weapons and ended by out Hitlering Hitler.
('93', 25, 5, 16, 54685) QUESTION: How can we reassure the people when the miscreants are still at large in these villages?
('93', 25, 6, 17, 54784) G. That is why I have insisted upon one good Mussalman standing surety along with a good Hindu for the safety and security of those who might be returning.
('93', 25, 6, 18, 54940) The former will have to be provided by the Muslim Leaguers who form the Bengal Government.

('93', 25, 8, 21, 55075) DATTAPARA, November 13, 1946
('93', 25, 9, 22, 55104) It was represented by the Maulvi Saheb who had spoken the previous day in the prayer meeting that the Muslims, far from wanting to drive away the Hindus, themselves felt insecure as a number of them with status and standing had been put under arrest although they were innocent and that was the real obstacle in the way of
('93', 25, 10, 23, 55427) 1 The officials included the District Magistrate, the Superintendent of Police and some officials.
('93', 25, 10, 24, 55526) There were besides a number of representatives of relief organizations, the refugees and some local Muslims.

('93', 26, 1, 2, 55682) their befriending the Hindus.
('93', 26, 1, 3, 55712) Gandhiji replied that he did not see how that could stand in the way of their establishing good relations with the Hindus.
('93', 26, 1, 4, 55835) On the contrary, it ought to provide an incentive for cultivating their friendship and winning their confidence so that there would be no motive left to get innocent Muslims implicated.
('93', 26, 1, 5, 56021) The issue was really irrelevant to the proposition before them.
('93', 26, 1, 6, 56085) When large numbers have participated in crime, it is but natural that some innocent men will be implicated with the guilty ones.
('93', 26, 1, 7, 56214) It is so all the world over.
('93', 26, 1, 8, 56243) That does not mean that the guilty ones should not be proceeded against.
('93', 26, 2, 9, 56316) The remedy was for the Muslims to confer with the Hindus and produce agreed lists of those who had been really guilty.
('93', 26, 2, 10, 56435) No innocent person would then suffer.
('93', 26, 2, 11, 56473) To bring to book the really guilty ones was the acid test of the sincerity of the authorities and the local Muslims alike.
('93', 26, 2, 12, 56596) Addressing the members of the Muslim League in the gathering, Gandhiji proceeded: I have come here to seek your co operation.
('93', 26, 2, 13, 56722) You are a pow erful party.
('93', 26, 2, 14, 56749) What has happened here does not show Islam at its best or even at its worst.
('93', 26, 2, 15, 56826) It is the very negation of Islam.
('93', 26, 2, 16, 56860) The first question we have got to settle is whether there can be co operation between the Hindus and Muslims.
('93', 26, 2, 17, 56970) I have apprised Shaheed Shurawardy of the things that have prevented the refugees from returning to their villages.
('93', 26, 2, 18, 57086) The havoc which I saw yesterday was appalling.
('93', 26, 2, 19, 57133) These things cannot be whitewashed.

('93', 27, 1, 2, 57936) Both the major parties are demoralized each in its own way.
('93', 27, 1, 3, 57996) So is the third partythe British rulers.
('93', 27, 1, 4, 58037) They cannot think cogently.
('93', 27, 1, 5, 58065) Military glory and love of power will not allow them to do so.
('93', 27, 1, 6, 58128) We see others as we are.
('93', 27, 1, 7, 58153) Hence the central teaching of the Gita: acquisition of the capacity to see things with detachment as perfect as it is humanly possible.
('93', 27, 1, 8, 58289) In my opinion for the British not to leave India till there is perfect peace in the land seems to be an impossible dream.
('93', 27, 1, 9, 58411) What they can and must do is to transfer the whole power to the willing and capable party at the earliest moment, to withdraw the British part of the army and disband the rest.
('93', 27, 1, 10, 58588) They should not think of keeping any part for the protection of British interests.
('93', 27, 1, 11, 58671) These must be left to the goodwill of the people of India.
('93', 27, 1, 12, 58730) This is the royal road to peaceful transfer and no other.
('93', 27, 1, 13, 58788) This conviction has not yet gone home to the cabinet.
('93', 27, 1, 14, 58842) I doubt not that you can work out all the corollaries to the above.
('93', 27, 1, 15, 58910) If you flounder at any point, send me your questions through a messenger.

('93', 27, 5, 23, 59227) I cannot call both of you to stay here.
('93', 27, 5, 24, 59267) Here it is a matter of do or die.
('93', 27, 5, 25, 59301) Do means making the Muslims see light.
('93', 27, 5, 26, 59340) Besides, those who are with me will each have to go and camp in a different village and, if necessary, lay down his life.
('93', 27, 5, 27, 59462) How can you then fit in here?
('93', 27, 5, 28, 59492) You are in service.
('93', 27, 5, 29, 59512) How can Manu stay alone in a strange village?
('93', 27, 5, 30, 59558) Nevertheless, if both of you are willing to stay in separate villages and sacrifice yourselves, I shall be ready to take you.
('93', 27, 5, 31, 59684) But if your telegram is meant only to seek permission for the two of you to come and see me, by all means do come.
('93', 27, 5, 32, 59799) There will no doubt be some risk in that too.
('93', 27, 5, 33, 59845) I cannot say where I shall be then.
('93', 27, 5, 34, 59881) I expect of course to be somewhere in East Bengal.
('93', 27, 5, 35, 59932) I do not even know whether I shall be alive.
('93', 27, 5, 36, 59977) Now do as you think fit.
('93', 27, 5, 37, 60002) I hope Manudi has recovered.

('93', 28, 1, 3, 60165) The climate and water are not very good.

('93', 28, 6, 14, 60643) You are to me what you are.
('93', 28, 6, 15, 60671) Acharya 1 told me everything.
('93', 28, 6, 16, 60701) I have communicated my view to Jawaharlal.
('93', 28, 6, 17, 60744) Please see it.
('93', 28, 6, 18, 60759) The more I think about it, the more I find myself against the Congress session at Meerut.
('93', 28, 6, 19, 60849) It is best not to have a session, but if you must have one, have it in New Delhi.
('93', 28, 6, 20, 60931) 2 Since it is Kripalanis affair, it is only right to let him take the final decision, though everyone should give his own view.
('93', 28, 6, 21, 61059) His address may be printed and read if the Congress is called off.
('93', 28, 6, 22, 61126) You have many problems before you.
('93', 28, 6, 23, 61161) You need peace to be able to solve them.
('93', 28, 6, 24, 61202) You need time as well.
('93', 28, 6, 25, 61225) If a mistake is made now, it will prove to be very costly.
('93', 28, 6, 26, 61284) I cannot leave this place.
('93', 28, 6, 27, 61311) If it is necessary to consult me, you should come here and ask me.
('93', 28, 6, 28, 61378) That is the only way out.
('93', 28, 6, 29, 61404) Truly speaking, there should be no need at all to consult me.
('93', 28, 6, 30, 61466) I have said and done enough.
('93', 28, 6, 31, 61495) The work here may perhaps be my last.
('93', 28, 6, 32, 61533) If I survive this, it will be a new life for me.
('93', 28, 6, 33, 61582) My non violence is being tested here in a way it has never been tested before.

('93', 29, 2, 3, 61949) SHAHPUR, November 14, 1946
('93', 29, 3, 4, 61976) Gandhiji had been told that there would be a big gathering at Shahpur.
('93', 29, 3, 5, 62047) But someone had spread the rumour that he would be accompanied by the Superintendent of Police, the District Magistrate and an armed guard who would utilize the occasion for making arrests, with the result that very few people were in evidence when Gandhiji arrived there.
('93', 29, 4, 6, 62320) It is a cruel joke, remarked Gandhiji.
('93', 29, 4, 7, 62359) For so far as he was concerned, he had never wanted any police or district authorities to accompany him.
('93', 29, 4, 8, 62464) But the authorities said they could not take the risk of letting him go about unprotected.
('93', 29, 5, 9, 62555) It had been brought to his notice that in several places, while the local Mussalmans professed to be anxious that peace should be re established, they were not prepared to do anything for it or give any guarantee unless the Muslim League leaders asked them to.
('93', 29, 5, 10, 62816) Gandhiji, recognizing the reasonableness of their suggestion, referred to a statement of Qaid e Azam Jinnah which he had read that morning.
('93', 29, 5, 11, 62956) He did not like everything in that statement but there were some things in it which should commend themselves to all.
('93', 29, 5, 12, 63074) In that statement Qaid e Azam Jinnah had said:
('93', 29, 6, 13, 63121) If the Mussalmans lose their balance and give vent to the spirit of vengeance and retaliation and prove false to the highest codes of morality and preachings of our great religion Islam, they will not only lose their title to the claim of Pakistan but also it will start of a most vicious circle of bloodshed and cruelty which will at once put off the day of our freedom and we shall only be helping to prolong the period of slavery and bondage.
('93', 29, 7, 14, 63567) He had further said :
('93', 29, 8, 15, 63589) We must prove politically that we are brave, generous and trustworthy .
('93', 29, 8, 16, 63661) that in the Pakistan areas the minorities will enjoy the fullest security of life, property and honour just as the Mussalmans themselves, nay, even greater.
('93', 29, 9, 17, 63818) He would like them, remarked Gandhiji, to ponder over that statement, if, on examination, they found that his quotation was correct.
('93', 29, 9, 18, 63951) Murder, loot, arson, abduction, forcible marriages and forcible conversions could not but prolong Indias slavery.
('93', 29, 9, 19, 64065) If they kept on quarrelling among themselves, if they looked to the police and the military for protection, they would be inciting the third party to rule over them.

('93', 30, 2, 3, 64477) KAZIRKHIL, November 14, 1946
('93', 30, 3, 4, 64506) Gandhiji said he found indescribable peace in the natural scenery around him but he found that peace missing on the faces of the men and women.
('93', 30, 3, 5, 64650) And how could they have peace after all that they had been through?
('93', 30, 3, 6, 64718) He found a number of guards standing there to protect him and his party.
('93', 30, 3, 7, 64791) Against whom were they to protect him?
('93', 30, 3, 8, 64830) He was not used to going about with a guard.
('93', 30, 3, 9, 64875) He had toured in Bengal unprotected before this.
('93', 30, 3, 10, 64924) He said: But today the authorities would not let me do so.
('93', 30, 3, 11, 64983) It is a matter of sorrow and shame for me and more than me it should be a matter of shame for the Mussalmans of East Bengal.
('93', 30, 4, 12, 65108) Even the schools and temples had been destroyed, he proceeded.
('93', 30, 4, 13, 65171) Shamsuddin Saheb, their Minister, did not like it.
('93', 30, 4, 14, 65222) The happenings in East Bengal, he said, had hurt him deeply.
('93', 30, 4, 15, 65283) The hearts of the people had to be purged of hatred.
('93', 30, 4, 16, 65336) For that their help and co operation was necessary.
('93', 30, 5, 17, 65388) This fratricide was more awful than anything in his experience.
('93', 30, 5, 18, 65452) He had carried on a grim struggle for 20 years in South Africa and for the last 30 years in India.
('93', 30, 5, 19, 65551) But this mutual slaughter had nonplussed him.
('93', 30, 5, 20, 65597) He did not know how he could induce the two communities to live in peace and harmony again.
('93', 30, 5, 21, 65689) He had come to Bengal to find out a solution for the problem.
('93', 30, 5, 22, 65751) Bengal was a big province.
('93', 30, 5, 23, 65778) If the communal problem could be solved here, it would be solved elsewhere also.
('93', 30, 5, 24, 65859) If he succeeded here, he would go away from Bengal with a new lease of life.
('93', 30, 5, 25, 65936) If not, he wished God to remove him from this earth.
('93', 30, 5, 26, 65989) He did not wish to leave Bengal empty handed.
('93', 30, 5, 27, 66035) The word pessimism was not to be found in his dictionary.
('93', 30, 6, 28, 66093) The Muslims butchered the Hindus and did worse things than butchery in Bengal and the Hindus butchered the Muslims in Bihar.
('93', 30, 6, 29, 66218) When both acted wickedly it was no use making comparisons or saying one was less wicked than the other, or who started the trouble.
('93', 30, 6, 30, 66350) If they wished to take revenge they should learn the art from him.
('93', 30, 6, 31, 66417) He also took revenge, but it was of a different type.
('93', 30, 6, 32, 66471) He had read a Gujarati poem in his childhood which said: If to him who gives you a glass of water, you give two, there is no merit in it.
('93', 30, 6, 33, 66609) Real merit lies in doing good to him who does you evil. Gandhiji concluded: That I consider noble revenge.
('93', 30, 7, 34, 66716) 1 Extracted from Pyarelals Weekly Letter.
('93', 30, 7, 35, 66758) At Kazirkhil, Gandhiji had been lodged in a partially destroyed house which had been cleaned up and made habitable.
('93', 30, 7, 36, 66874) Prayers were held in the compound of the house.
('93', 31, 0, 1, 66922) 32 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('93', 31, 1, 2, 66963) I read a story about one of the earlier Caliphs.
('93', 31, 1, 3, 67012) A man attacked the Caliph with a sword.
('93', 31, 1, 4, 67052) The Caliph wrested the sword from the assailants hands and was going to kill him when the assailant spat on his face.
('93', 31, 1, 5, 67170) The Caliph thereupon let him go free because the indignity had filled him with personal anger.
('93', 31, 1, 6, 67265) This produced a great impression upon the assailant and he embraced Islam.
('93', 31, 1, 7, 67340) One who is forcibly converted to Islam ceases to be a man.
('93', 31, 1, 8, 67399) To recite the Kalma through fear is meaningless.

('93', 32, 2, 3, 68311) RAMGANJ, November 15, 1946
('93', 32, 3, 4, 68338) Gandhiji reiterated and emphasized his previous days appeal.
('93', 32, 3, 5, 68399) He could talk to them of nothing but sorrow and suffering these days.
('93', 32, 3, 6, 68469) Wherever he went he saw awful sights of destruction.
('93', 32, 3, 7, 68522) There were no tears in his eyes.
('93', 32, 3, 8, 68555) He who shed tears could not wipe those of others, but his heart did weep.
('93', 32, 3, 9, 68629) He had come with the hope that he could have a frank talk with the Mussalmans and that they would repent of their misdeeds and request the Hindus not to leave their homes.
('93', 32, 3, 10, 68801) If the repentance was genuine, the Hindus would recognize their sincerity and regain lost confidence.
('93', 32, 3, 11, 68903) But he could see that the Hindus and the Muslims of East Bengal had been embittered against one another.
('93', 32, 3, 12, 69008) He would not go into the reasons thereof.
('93', 32, 3, 13, 69050) But the Muslim brethren would permit him to say that so far as he knew, in East Bengal they had been the aggressors.
('93', 32, 3, 14, 69167) The Hindus were mortally afraid of them.
('93', 32, 3, 15, 69208) At Chaumuhani Muslims came to his meeting in larger numbers than the Hindus did.
('93', 32, 3, 16, 69289) But he did not know why they were avoiding him after the first meeting at Dattapara.
('93', 32, 3, 17, 69374) It hurt him.
('93', 32, 3, 18, 69387) He wanted the few Mussalmans who were present at the meeting to carry his message to the rest.
('93', 32, 3, 19, 69482) A Muslim sister who had been going about meeting leading Muslims in these parts had said that the Muslims told her plainly that they wanted orders from the League leaders before they could promise to befriend the Hindus or attend Gandhijis meetings.
('93', 32, 3, 20, 69732) The exodus of the Hindus was still continuing.
('93', 32, 3, 21, 69779) If the Muslims assured them that they were neighbours, friends and brothers, sons of the same soil, breathing the same air and drinking the same water, that the Hindus had nothing to fear from them, the exodus would stop and even those who had left their homes would return.
('93', 32, 3, 22, 70054) Even animals were friendly to those who befriended them.
('93', 32, 3, 23, 70111) But man was made in the image of God.
('93', 32, 3, 24, 70149) To justify his inheritance, man had to return good for evil.
('93', 32, 3, 25, 70210) Whosoever was at fault, this truth applied to both the parties.
('93', 32, 3, 26, 70274) The Muslims wanted orders from the League.
('93', 32, 3, 27, 70317) He could understand it.
('93', 32, 3, 28, 70341) There was a League Government in the province.
('93', 32, 3, 29, 70388) But that did not mean that the Government should be inimical to those outside the League.
('93', 32, 4, 30, 70478) He reiterated what he said 2 about Qaid e Azam Jinnahs message on the previous day.
('93', 32, 4, 31, 70562) They should search their hearts and ask themselves if they had lived up to that message.
('93', 32, 4, 32, 70651) He concluded: So far as I know, Islam does not permit forcible conversion and atrocities on women.
('93', 32, 4, 33, 70750) What good can a mere repetition of the Kalma do to one whose heart does not accept Islam?
('93', 32, 4, 34, 70840) You should ask your leaders, therefore, whether you are to be friends with the Hindus or

('93', 33, 3, 7, 71352) BHAI VIYOGI HARI, Yesterday I read the letter written to you by your colleagues there.
('93', 33, 3, 8, 71439) I do not consider it uncivil.
('93', 33, 3, 9, 71469) The answer to it is not your resignation 1. On the contrary, you should have a talk with them and satisfy them .
('93', 33, 3, 10, 71582) 2 is one of them.
('93', 33, 3, 11, 71600) Work under him.
('93', 33, 3, 12, 71616) To come out from there would be forsaking your duty.
('93', 33, 3, 13, 71669) If you find yourself in a dilemma, you may come here and thrash it out with me.
('93', 33, 3, 14, 71749) Bapa has seen this.
('93', 33, 3, 15, 71769) He agrees with me.
('93', 33, 3, 16, 71788) Both of us are stuck here.

('93', 33, 7, 21, 71992) It is the duty of a worker to keep his body and mind healthy.

('93', 34, 2, 3, 72430) KAZIRKHIL, November 16, 1946
('93', 34, 3, 4, 72459) Gandhiji, addressing the meeting after Goffran Saheb 2, began by referring to Shamsuddin Sahebs speech 3 at Chaumuhani a few days ago.
('93', 34, 3, 5, 72594) They had now heard Goffran Saheb.
('93', 34, 3, 6, 72628) The Ministers wanted them to live together as friends.
('93', 34, 3, 7, 72683) The police and the military could not protect them.
('93', 34, 3, 8, 72735) God alone could protect them.
('93', 34, 3, 9, 72765) They had, therefore, to look to each other for their safety.
('93', 34, 3, 10, 72826) Goffran Saheb had told them that the Government did not wish the Hindus to leave East Bengal.
('93', 34, 3, 11, 72920) Awful things had no doubt happened but they should let bygones be bygones.
('93', 34, 3, 12, 72995) They must turn a new leaf.
('93', 34, 3, 13, 73022) When one had suffered as they had, one was liable to become filled with suspicion.
('93', 34, 3, 14, 73105) But that had to be overcome.
('93', 34, 4, 15, 73134) A member from the audience had requested him to allow him five minutes to reply to Goffran Sahebs speech which he said, required correction in several places.
('93', 34, 4, 16, 73293) But Gandhiji replied that he was afraid he could not allow the meeting to be turned into a public debate.
('93', 34, 4, 17, 73399) Whatever was said at the meeting was said in good faith 4 and to do His work.
('93', 34, 4, 18, 73477) But if the friend in question sent him a letter, not couched offensively, he would gladly forward it to Goffran Saheb.
('93', 34, 4, 19, 73596) He rebuked the audience too for not observing pindrop silence while the Muslim Members of the audience were performing namaz.
('93', 34, 4, 20, 73722) Culture and good breeding required that they should observe silence when others said their prayer.
('93', 34, 4, 21, 73821) There should be mutual respect.
('93', 34, 4, 22, 73853) All worshi pped the same God, whatever their religion.
('93', 34, 4, 23, 73908) He was glad to see the Congress and the League flags flying together in the prayer ground.
('93', 34, 4, 24, 73999) Both had great significance.
('93', 34, 4, 25, 74028) They should realize as Qaid e Azam Jinnah Saheb had said that if they kept on quarrelling among themselves the country would remain a slave country and Pakistan would vanish into thin air.
('93', 34, 5, 26, 74217) He was receiving threatening letters, said Gandhiji.
('93', 34, 5, 27, 74270) Some Muslims feared that he had come to suppress them.
('93', 34, 5, 28, 74325) He could assure them that he had never suppressed anyone in all his life.
('93', 34, 5, 29, 74399) They asked him why he had not gone to Bihar.
('93', 34, 5, 30, 74444) He had declared his resolve to fast 5 if Bihar did not stop the madness.
('93', 34, 5, 31, 74517) He was in constant touch with Bihar.
('93', 34, 5, 32, 74554) Pandit Jawaharlalji, Dr. Rajendra Prasad and others had assured him that his

('93', 35, 1, 3, 74978) Bihar, he understood, was practically peaceful now.
('93', 35, 1, 4, 75030) Tension was still there, but it was going.
('93', 35, 1, 5, 75073) The Muslims were returning to their villages.
('93', 35, 1, 6, 75119) The Government had taken the responsibility to build the houses of those who had been rendered homeless.
('93', 35, 1, 7, 75224) He was also receiving many telegrams from Hindus asking why he did not fast against the Muslims for the happenings in Bengal.
('93', 35, 1, 8, 75350) He could not do so today.
('93', 35, 1, 9, 75376) If the Mussalmans realized that he was their friend, he would be entitled to fast against them also.
('93', 35, 1, 10, 75477) If he was to leave East Bengal he would go only after peace ruled the breasts of the Hindus and the Muslims.
('93', 35, 1, 11, 75586) He had no desire to live any longer otherwise.
('93', 35, 2, 12, 75633) He was in the midst of a Muslim population in Noakhali, he said.
('93', 35, 2, 13, 75698) He did not like the idea of staying with Hindu friends.
('93', 35, 2, 14, 75754) He would like to see if he could stay with a League Mussalman.
('93', 35, 2, 15, 75817) My requirements are very few.
('93', 35, 2, 16, 75847) All I want is cleanliness, clean water, permissible food and the freedom to pray to God in my own way.
('93', 35, 2, 17, 75950) The Muslim friends will have an opportunity to examine me at close quarters and find out whether I am an enemy or a friend.

('93', 35, 5, 20, 76160) KAZIRKHIL, November 17, 1946
('93', 35, 6, 21, 76189) The District Magistrate had issued orders and advertized the fact, remarked Gandhiji, that forcible conversions, i.e., conversions out of fear, would not be recognized by law.
('93', 35, 6, 22, 76365) He did not know if everyone of those who had been converted forcibly had been restored to Hinduism.
('93', 35, 6, 23, 76465) It not, it should be done if they wanted to replace the present bitterness between the two communities by cordiality.
('93', 35, 7, 24, 76583) Some abducted girls were still missing.
('93', 35, 7, 25, 76623) They should be returned without further delay.
('93', 35, 7, 26, 76670) A dhobi had brought to him his boy of one year this afternoon.
('93', 35, 7, 27, 76733) He had recovered the child after a month from a Muslim with police help.
('93', 35, 7, 28, 76806) It was the duty of the Muslim brethren to put an end to such acts.
('93', 35, 7, 29, 76873) They should make a frank confession of error in the past and promise to avoid it in future.
('93', 35, 7, 30, 76965) He, who tried to hide his mistakes, could never rectify them.
('93', 35, 7, 31, 77027) He himself was a votary of truth.
('93', 35, 7, 32, 77061) Even when he

('93', 35, 8, 34, 77139) 2 Extracted from Pyarelals Weekly Letter.
('93', 35, 8, 35, 77181) On the morning of November 17, Gandhiji had visited the village of Dashgharia, two miles from Kazirkhil, where he was met by a large number of women, who had all been forcibly converted and now reconverted to their own religion.
('93', 36, 0, 1, 77410) VOL. 93: 7 NOVEMBER, 1946 16 FEBRUARY, 1947 37
('93', 36, 1, 2, 77457) practised law, he told his clients to tell him the truth if they wanted him to take up their case.
('93', 36, 1, 3, 77556) He would not plead for a false case.
('93', 36, 1, 4, 77593) The result was that only true and bona fide cases were brought to him.
('93', 36, 1, 5, 77664) He had long ceased to practise law and had even been struck off the rolls of the Bar register 1 for the offence of sedition.
('93', 36, 1, 6, 77789) But he continued to follow the same principle.
('93', 36, 1, 7, 77836) His advice to the Hindus and the Muslims was to get rid of all evil in themselves.
('93', 36, 1, 8, 77919) Without that they would not be able to live in peace or have respect for one another.
('93', 36, 2, 9, 78005) Gandhiji observed that he had heard that because he did not allow a gentleman to reply to Goffran Sahebs remarks there and then at the meeting, the Hindus were annoyed and had boycotted the meeting.
('93', 36, 2, 10, 78204) 2 He was unrepentant.
('93', 36, 2, 11, 78226) He never said or did anything merely to please others.
('93', 36, 2, 12, 78281) He had always taught that one should do ones duty irrespective of the reaction it may have on others.
('93', 36, 2, 13, 78383) A man who always did what he believed to be right never feared anyone.

('93', 39, 7, 17, 83097) It eats into the vitals of the terror stricken as well as the terrorist.
('93', 39, 7, 18, 83170) The latter fears something in his victim.
('93', 39, 7, 19, 83212) It may be his different religion or his riches that he fears.
('93', 39, 7, 20, 83274) The second kind of fear is otherwise known as greed [or love of material possession] 5. If you search [deeply] enough, you will find that greed is a variety of fear.
('93', 39, 7, 21, 83440) But there has never been, and will never be, a man who is able to intimidate one who has cast out fear from his heart.

('93', 40, 1, 4, 84180) All other fear will then disappear by itself.
('93', 40, 1, 5, 84226) Till fearlessness is cultivated by the people there will never be any peace in these parts for the Hindus or for the Mussalmans.
('93', 40, 1, 6, 84355) Hence in order to establish any real peace, I have suggested that each affected village must have one good Hindu and one good Mussalman to accompany the returning refugees.

('93', 40, 4, 9, 84614) MADHUPUR, November 19,1946
('93', 40, 5, 10, 84641) Gandhiji observed that a friend 2 had told him that the explanation 3 was a make believe.
('93', 40, 5, 11, 84731) If they had boycotted the meeting, he did no mind it.
('93', 40, 5, 12, 84785) They owed him no apology on that account.
('93', 40, 5, 13, 84827) And if they had stayed away out of fear, certainly no apology was due to him.
('93', 40, 5, 14, 84905) But it was a shame for them to be so afraid.
('93', 40, 5, 15, 84950) Were the men also such cowards that they had stayed away out of fear?
('93', 40, 5, 16, 85020) Were the Muslims going to eat them up?
('93', 40, 5, 17, 85059) If they were such cowards, they were not worthy of living in this country.
('93', 40, 5, 18, 85134) The sister who had gone to him in the morning to request him to hold a womens meeting at Madhupur had put before him three questions.
('93', 40, 5, 19, 85268) The first question was that in spite of all their efforts they were unable to rescue some of the abducted women.
('93', 40, 5, 20, 85381) He had told her that she should write to him about it and he would forward the letter to Shaheed Suhrawardy.
('93', 40, 5, 21, 85490) He could even write to the Prime Minister directly.
('93', 40, 5, 22, 85542) It was a matter which brooked no delay.
('93', 40, 5, 23, 85582) Secondly she said there were some women in the villages who wanted to come away but wanted a military escort.
('93', 40, 5, 24, 85692) He never could be a party to that.
('93', 40, 5, 25, 85727) He had told the Prime Minister that he for one was not enamoured of the police and the military and that he could withdraw it at any time.
('93', 40, 5, 26, 85866) The Hindus and the Muslims should be free to break each others heads if they wanted to.
('93', 40, 5, 27, 85954) He would put up with that.
('93', 40, 5, 28, 85981) But if they continued to look to the police and the military for help, they would remain slaves for ever.
('93', 40, 5, 29, 86087) Those who preferred security to freedom had no right to live.
('93', 40, 5, 30, 86149) He wanted the women to become brave.
('93', 40, 5, 31, 86186) To change ones religion under threat of force was no conversion but rather cowardice.
('93', 40, 5, 32, 86272) A cowardly man or woman was a dead weight on any religion.
('93', 40, 5, 33, 86331) Out of fear they might become Muslims today, Christians tomorrow and pass into a third religion the day after.
('93', 40, 5, 34, 86442) That was not

('93', 41, 1, 3, 86671) It was up to the men workers to tell the women that they would be their escort and would protect them with their lives.
('93', 41, 1, 4, 86791) If still the women were afraid to come away, there was no help for them.
('93', 41, 1, 5, 86864) He had come to proclaim from the housetops that the women had to become brave or else die.
('93', 41, 1, 6, 86955) They should make use of the calamity that had befallen them to cast out the demon of fear.
('93', 41, 1, 7, 87046) Lastly the sister had asked as to how they could advise the refugees to go back to their homes.
('93', 41, 1, 8, 87142) He would not ask them to go back under police or military protection.
('93', 41, 1, 9, 87212) They had run away out of the fear of the Muslims.
('93', 41, 1, 10, 87262) Therefore, it was the Muslims who had to come forward and reassure them that they would regard them as their own mothers, daughters and sisters and protect them with their lives.
('93', 41, 1, 11, 87441) Everybody must be entitled to retain his or her own religion without interference.
('93', 41, 1, 12, 87524) All worshipped the same God although under different names.
('93', 41, 1, 13, 87584) If I see my God in this tree and worship it, why should the Muslims object?
('93', 41, 2, 14, 87660) It was wrong for anyone to say that his God was superior to anothers.
('93', 41, 2, 15, 87730) God was one and the same for all.
('93', 41, 2, 16, 87764) Hence, his formula was that from every village one good Hindu and one good Muslim should stand surety for the peace of the village.
('93', 41, 2, 17, 87896) Then and then alone would he ask the refugees to return.
('93', 41, 2, 18, 87953) The Ministers had liked his suggestion.

('93', 41, 4, 21, 88041) KAZIRKHIL, [November 19, 1946] 2
('93', 41, 5, 22, 88074) QUESTION: Will the new experiment, which you propose to inaugurate tomorrow, of going and living singly in affected villages, infuse courage into the hearts of refugees and succeed in persuading them to return to their villages?
('93', 41, 5, 23, 88303) What is the significance underlying this experiment?
('93', 41, 5, 24, 88356) GANDHIJI: This question would not arise if you knew that I was going to a village for my own sake, that is, to test my ahimsa.
('93', 41, 5, 25, 88483) I am not going singly; there will be Nirmal Kumar Bose as my Bengali interpreter and my stenographer Parasuram from the South.
('93', 41, 5, 26, 88610) If I have the requisite courage and capacity to undergo a comparatively hard life and to encourage inner ahimsa, I should expect to affect both Hindus and Muslims in the right manner.
('93', 41, 5, 27, 88794) You should also know that all members of my original party will similarly distribute themselves, taking with them a local Bengali

('93', 42, 1, 3, 89141) The choice of village will rest with Satis Chandra Das Gupta.
('93', 42, 2, 4, 89203) Asked whether Bengal Government would not feel that his action was aimed at bringing ridicule on them, Gandhiji replied: I think not, only because I have not the remotest idea of bringing ridicule on them, assuming of course that Bengal Govern ment have meant every word of what they have said.
('93', 42, 2, 5, 89498) Indeed, I am in search of a League Muslim who will harbour me in his house as a member of his family.
('93', 42, 3, 6, 89600) Q. Are you not taking a serious liberty with your life at this stage by proposing to live in a village which is perhaps not free from goondas ?
('93', 42, 4, 7, 89744) G. I recognize no one as a goondaor all are goondas, some more, some less.
('93', 42, 4, 8, 89819) I have the conviction that so long as God wants my service in the present body, He will keep it from all harm.

('93', 42, 6, 11, 89974) [On or before November 20, 1946] 2
('93', 42, 7, 12, 90009) When I was in detention in the Aga Khan Palace, I once sat down to write a thesis on India as a protagonist of non violence.
('93', 42, 7, 13, 90134) But as I proceeded with my writing, I could not go on.
('93', 42, 7, 14, 90189) I had to stop.
('93', 42, 7, 15, 90204) There are two aspects of Hinduism.
('93', 42, 7, 16, 90239) There is, on the one hand, the historical Hinduism with its untouchability, superstitious worship of stocks and stones, animal sacrifice and so on.
('93', 42, 7, 17, 90387) On the other, we have the Hinduism of the Gita, the Upanishads and Patanjalis Yoga Sutra which is the acme of ahimsa and oneness of all creation, pure worship of one immanent, formless imperishable God.
('93', 42, 7, 18, 90590) Ahimsa which to me is the chief glory of Hinduism has been sought to be explained away by our people as being meant for sannyasis only.
('93', 42, 7, 19, 90726) I do not share that view.
('93', 42, 7, 20, 90752) I have held that it is the way of life and India has to show it to the world.
('93', 42, 7, 21, 90830) Where do I stand?
('93', 42, 7, 22, 90848) Do I represent this ahimsa in my person?
('93', 42, 7, 23, 90889) If I do, then deceit and hatred that poison the atmosphere should dissolve.
('93', 42, 7, 24, 90965) It is only by going into isolation from my compa nions, those on whose help I have relied all along, and standing on my own feet that I shall find my bearings and also test my faith in God.

('93', 46, 5, 9, 95259) November 20, 1946 I find myself in the midst of exaggeration and falsity.
('93', 46, 5, 10, 95333) I am unable to discover the truth.
('93', 46, 5, 11, 95368) There is terrible mutual distrust.
('93', 46, 5, 12, 95403) Oldest friendships have snapped.
('93', 46, 5, 13, 95436) Truth and ahimsa by which I swear, and which have, to my knowledge, sustained me for sixty years, seem to fail to show the attributes I have ascribed to them.
('93', 46, 5, 14, 95595) To test them, or better, to test myself, I am going to a village called Srirampur, cutting myself away from those who have been with me all these years, and who have made life easy for me.
('93', 46, 5, 15, 95784) I am taking Prof.
('93', 46, 5, 16, 95802) Nirmal Kumar Bose as my Bengali teacher and interpreter and Shri Parasuram, who has been my most devoted, selfless and silent stenographer.
('93', 46, 5, 17, 95942) The other workers, whom I have brought with me, will each distribute themselves in other villages of Noakhali to do the work ofpeace, if it is at all possible, between the two communities.
('93', 46, 5, 18, 96131) They are, unfortunately, all non Bengalis except little Abha 1. They will, there fore, be accompanied by one Bengali worker each as teacher and interpreter, even like Prof.
('93', 46, 5, 19, 96304) N. K. Bose will be to me.
('93', 46, 5, 20, 96330) Distribution work and selection work will be done by Shri Satis Chandra Das Gupta of the Khadi Pratishthan.
('93', 46, 5, 21, 96438) My ideal is to live in a local Muslim League family, but I see that I must not wait for that happy day.
('93', 46, 5, 22, 96542) I must meanwhile establish such contacts with the Muslims as I can in their own villages.
('93', 46, 5, 23, 96632) My suggestion to the League Ministers is that they should give me one honest and brave Muslim to accompany one equally honest and brave Hindu for each affected village.
('93', 46, 5, 24, 96801) They should guarantee, at the cost of their lives if need be, the

('93', 47, 1, 3, 96983) I am sorry to have to confess that without some such thing it seems to me difficult to induce them to return to their villages.
('93', 47, 1, 4, 97111) From all accounts received by me, life is not as yet smooth and safe for the minority community in the villages.
('93', 47, 1, 5, 97224) They, therefore, prefer to live as exiles from their own homes, crops, plantations and surroundings, and live on inadequate and ill balanced doles.
('93', 47, 1, 6, 97372) Many friends from outside Bengal have written to me to allow them to come for peace work but I have strongly dissuaded them from coming.
('93', 47, 1, 7, 97509) I would love to let them come if and when I see light through this impenetrable darkness.
('93', 47, 1, 8, 97599) In the meantime, both Pyarelal and I have decided to suspend all other activities in the shape of correspondence, including the heavy work of the Harijan and the allied weeklies.
('93', 47, 1, 9, 97778) I have asked Shri Kishorelal, Shri Kakasaheb, Shri Vinoba and Shri Narahari Parikh to edit the weeklies jointly and severally.
('93', 47, 1, 10, 97905) Pyarelal and I may, if our work permits, send stra contributions from our respective villages.
('93', 47, 1, 11, 98000) Corresp ondence will be attended to from Sevagram.
('93', 47, 1, 12, 98051) How long this suspense will last is more than I can say.
('93', 47, 1, 13, 98108) This much, however, I can.
('93', 47, 1, 14, 98135) I do not propose to leave East Bengal till I am satisfied that mutual trust has been established between the two communities and the two have resumed the even tenor of their life in their villages.
('93', 47, 1, 15, 98333) Without this there is neither Pakistan nor Hindustan only slavery awaits India, torn asunder by mutual strife and engrossed in barbarity.
('93', 47, 1, 16, 98471) No one need at present be disturbed about my low diet.

('93', 48, 2, 3, 99004) SRIRAMPUR, November 20, 1946
('93', 48, 3, 4, 99033) Speaking after the prayer at Srirampur to an audience of about a thousand persons, Gandhiji said that he had never imagined he would be able to come and settle down in a devastated village in Noakhali so soon.
('93', 48, 3, 5, 99243) This had become possible through Satish Babus efforts.
('93', 48, 3, 6, 99298) He had come here alone, with two companions only.
('93', 48, 3, 7, 99348) One was to act as his interpreter and teach him Bengali, while the other, Shri Parasuram, who was from Malabar, had been brought along because he knew no Bengali and little Hindustani and so could not be set up in a village alone.
('93', 48, 3, 8, 99579) For all practical purposes he had thus come here alone.
('93', 48, 3, 9, 99635) His companions had been left behind at Kazirkhil, and each of them was likewise to choose one village for himself.
('93', 48, 3, 10, 99750) His idea was that every Hindu worker thus sent should be accompanied by a single Mussalman worker, and both of them together should mix with the local people and gradually create an atmosphere in which the refugees would shed their fear and be able to come back and live in peace and friendship once more.
('93', 48, 3, 11, 100056) For a Mussalman worker he depended on Shaheed Saheb and Shamsuddin Saheb.
('93', 48, 3, 12, 100130) But he could not afford to wait until such a worker was available.
('93', 48, 3, 13, 100197) He had, therefore, come here as soon as he found the opportunity.
('93', 48, 3, 14, 100263) It was good that some Mussalmans were present in the meeting and two local Mussalman friends had already invited him to visit their homes.
('93', 48, 3, 15, 100402) They had assured him that they also wanted the Hindus back in the village, but the Hindus were not yet in the proper frame of mind to do so.
('93', 48, 4, 16, 100543) Fear is a thing which he disliked.
('93', 48, 4, 17, 100578) Why should one man be afraid of another man?
('93', 48, 4, 18, 100623) Man should stand in fear of God alone, and then he can shed all other fears.
('93', 48, 4, 19, 100700) Pyarelal had come to the meeting a short while ago.
('93', 48, 4, 20, 100752) On his way, he had met about 150 refugees who were going away from the village with their belongings.
('93', 48, 4, 21, 100854) On enquiry the refugees had told him that they were afraid that when the military and police left there would be fresh trouble.
('93', 48, 4, 22, 100982) Whilst the roads were safe, therefore, they took the opportunity of moving away to some place of safety.
('93', 48, 4, 23, 101087) But the man who is possessed by fear will not find safety anywhere.
('93', 48, 4, 24, 101155) What help can the military or the police give to such a man?
('93', 48, 4, 25, 101216) To depend on military and police aid is to add to ones helplessness.
('93', 48, 4, 26, 101285) He would therefore like these refugees to develop personal courage so that they would consider it beneath their dignity to fly from fancied danger merely for fear of losing their lives.
('93', 48, 4, 27, 101471) Therefore, the better course for intending refugees would be to derive personal courage from men like him who went to the affected villages, assuming of course that these had the requisite courage.
('93', 48, 5, 28, 101669) But whether he could personally infuse such courage in another man or not he

('93', 49, 1, 2, 101927) did not know.
('93', 49, 1, 3, 101941) So long he had lived amidst a number of companions.
('93', 49, 1, 4, 101993) But now he had begun to say to himself, Now is the time.
('93', 49, 1, 5, 102050) If you want to know yourself, go forth alone. It was therefore that he had come practically alone like this to the present village.
('93', 49, 1, 6, 102182) With unquenchable faith in God he proposed to persevere so as to succeed in disarming all opposition and inspiring confidence.
('93', 49, 2, 7, 102309) He would live here amidst the Muslim villagers, form intimate acquaintance with each family, know their mind, and help them also to know his mind.
('93', 49, 2, 8, 102456) When they thus knew one another intimately, then would perhaps come the time when the atmosphere would change and sweetness prevail in the relations between Hindus and Mussalmans, where sourness was prevailing today.

('93', 49, 5, 12, 102749) When I asked him whether he did not feel he was living alone as in jail, Gandhiji said : Yes, but with this difference.,In jail I had willy nilly to live alone.
('93', 49, 5, 13, 102910) Here I have deliberately imposed it on myself.
('93', 49, 5, 14, 102957) There are now two with me and they are too many.
('93', 49, 5, 15, 103006) While Nirmal Babu will be my interpreter, Parasuram will help me in other ways.
('93', 49, 5, 16, 103086) I want to reduce my correspondence to the minimum and I may write for the Harijan if I feel the urge.
('93', 49, 6, 17, 103188) When asked whether he was not putting too great a physical strain on himself, he said : People have been pampering me too much.
('93', 49, 6, 18, 103316) I would not have felt free until I was severely alone.
('93', 49, 7, 19, 103371) Asked how long he proposed to stay in the village, he said that it all depended on how things shaped in the coming days.
('93', 49, 8, 20, 103492) Explaining his programme of activity in the village, Gandhiji said that he had already seen local Muslims and explained the object of his visit.
('93', 49, 8, 21, 103637) He proposed to go every morning to the houses of local Muslims and talk to them in order to ascertain their real views on the present situation.
('93', 49, 8, 22, 103782) He would invite them to attend his prayer meetings and would influence them in every way so as to bring about friendly relations between the two communities.

('93', 50, 3, 4, 104205) In the army, a soldier who does not take care of his feet, for instance, and allows corns to form makes himself liable to be cashiered; much more is expected of a soldier of non violence.

('93', 50, 5, 7, 104435) [On or after November 20, 1946] You are not to proceed to your village.
('93', 50, 5, 8, 104507) Those who go to village have to go there with the determination to do or die.
('93', 50, 5, 9, 104585) If they fall ill, they must get well or die there.
('93', 50, 5, 10, 104636) Then alone would their going have any meaning.
('93', 50, 5, 11, 104683) In practice, this means that in case of illness, they must be content to do with home remedies or the therapy of natures elements.
('93', 50, 5, 12, 104814) Sushilas medical services are not supposed to be available to the members of our party.
('93', 50, 5, 13, 104902) Her services are all premortgaged to the village folk of East Bengal.
('93', 50, 5, 14, 104972) She has her work cut out in her village.
('93', 50, 5, 15, 105013) 4 It wont do to live in the villages like a jinn.
('93', 50, 5, 16, 105063) We must learn to live and move with the proverbial cautiousness and wisdom of a she elephant.
('93', 50, 5, 17, 105157) Then alone shall we have the fitness to live there.
('93', 50, 5, 18, 105209) To live in the villages of Bengal calls for a special knack.
('93', 50, 5, 19, 105270) We have all to cultivate it.
('93', 50, 5, 20, 105299) You and I have to pass that test.

('93', 53, 3, 4, 109485) Gandhiji told them that if Noakhali set any precedent in the transfer of population to other districts in Bengal, other provinces might follow it, and such a policy would be suicidal for the whole country.
('93', 53, 3, 5, 109691) He could never approve of such a scheme.
('93', 53, 3, 6, 109732) He would not advise the people to leave their homes and go away somewhere else.
('93', 53, 3, 7, 109812) The Bengalees were always in the forefront of civilized life in bravery and sacrifice and it was really shocking to find that people would run away in fear giving up their hearths and homes.
('93', 53, 3, 8, 110003) He wanted to see every Hindu family settle down in its own village and face the situation fearlessly and with courage.
('93', 53, 4, 9, 110122) Concluding, Gandhiji told them that the present problem was not the question of Noakhali alone; it was a problem for the whole of Bengal and the whole of India.

('93', 53, 8, 14, 110478) 1 The U. P. I. report said: On behalf of Noakhali Central Relief, Rescue and Rehabilitation Committee, they met Gandhiji during his morning walk to place before him concrete suggestions about the temporary removal of refugees to West Bengal or outside for rehabilitation on a planned scheme. 2 In Mahatma GandhiThe Last Phase, Pyarelal says: A conference of about 30 representatives of both the communities and Government spokesmen was held at Ramgunj Dak Bungalow on the evening of November 22, when a plan for the establishment of peace, based on the Bengal Governments proposals, was finally hammered out, and a nucleus of the Peace Committee for Ramgunj police station was formed.
('93', 53, 8, 15, 111163) The formula adopted was that there should be Peace Committees, with equal number of Hindus and Muslims, for the village, the village union, and the police station.
('93', 53, 8, 16, 111327) The Muslims would be selected by the Hindus and an official would be the chairman.
('93', 53, 8, 17, 111410) The Government would undertake to implement the recommen dations of the Peace Committees.
('93', 53, 8, 18, 111500) The functions of the Peace Committees were defined to be (a) to do intensive propaganda work to restore confidence, (b) to help in constructing shelters for the returning refugees, and in procuring and distributing relief, e.g., food, clothing, etc., (c) to draw up lists of culprits and disturbers of peace, who should be rounded up, and (d) to prepare a list of houses destroyed or damaged during the disturbances.

('93', 54, 1, 3, 112074) He again stressed the need for one honest Muslim and one honest Hindu to stand as sureties for the protection of the villagers and these two men must be prepared to die if necessary.

('93', 54, 5, 19, 112877) Abdullah (the Superintendent of Police) with some others came for the meeting at Ramgunj in the evening.
('93', 54, 5, 20, 112982) Started at 4 p.
('93', 54, 5, 21, 112998) with them for Ramgunj.
('93', 54, 5, 22, 113021) Reached Ramgunj at 5.20 p.
('93', 54, 5, 23, 113048) The meeting continued till 10.30 p.
('93', 54, 5, 24, 113084) Addressed a few words at the end.
('93', 54, 5, 25, 113118) Had evening prayer on the boat on the return journey and then some sleep.
('93', 54, 5, 26, 113192) Had milk while proceeding to Ramgunj; hot water on return.

('93', 54, 8, 30, 113349) There is a saying in English, The King is dead, Long Live the King.
('93', 54, 8, 31, 113417) The same may be said with reference to Malaviyaji.
('93', 54, 8, 32, 113468) Malaviyaji was born for India and lives in the works he did for India.
('93', 54, 8, 33, 113539) They were many.
('93', 54, 8, 34, 113555) They were great works.
('93', 54, 8, 35, 113578) The most magnificent among them is the Hindu Vishva Vidyalaya.
('93', 54, 8, 36, 113641) We erroneously call it the Benares Hindu University.
('93', 54, 8, 37, 113694) For this, not Malaviyaji but his followers are to blame.
('93', 54, 9, 38, 113751) 1 The report said that after three hours discussion, the representatives agreed to form and join peace committees.
('93', 54, 9, 39, 113866) 2 Homestead or a cluster of homesteads 3 A translation of this also appeared in Harijan, 8 12 1946.
('93', 55, 0, 1, 113966) 56 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('93', 55, 1, 2, 114007) Malaviyaji was a servant of his servants.
('93', 55, 1, 3, 114049) He let his followers do as they liked.
('93', 55, 1, 4, 114088) I know he was full of such magnanimity.
('93', 55, 1, 5, 114128) He had it to the point of a fault.
('93', 55, 1, 6, 114163) But the saying no blame attaches to the mighty applies equally to Malaviyaji.
('93', 55, 1, 7, 114241) He cherished the name Hindu Vishva Vidyalaya.
('93', 55, 1, 8, 114287) The correction is even now due.
('93', 55, 1, 9, 114319) Every stone of this University should reflect Hindu dharma.
('93', 55, 1, 10, 114379) Not a single building should symbolize the materialism of the West, rather, it should stand for spirituality.
('93', 55, 1, 11, 114489) The same should go for the teachers and scholars.
('93', 55, 1, 12, 114539) Is that so today?
('93', 55, 1, 13, 114557) Can it be said that every scholar of the University is a living embodiment of pure religion?
('93', 55, 1, 14, 114650) If not, why not?
('93', 55, 1, 15, 114667) The University will be judged not by the number of its scholars but by the degree to which they exemplify Hindu dharma, however small their number.
('93', 55, 1, 16, 114815) I know the task is an arduous one.
('93', 55, 1, 17, 114850) But this is of essence for the University.
('93', 55, 1, 18, 114893) If this be not so, the University is no thing.
('93', 55, 1, 19, 114940) The duty, therefore, of Malaviyajis sons and followers is clear.
('93', 55, 1, 20, 115005) What place does Hinduism occupy in the world today?
('93', 55, 1, 21, 115057) What are its blemishes?
('93', 55, 1, 22, 115081) How can they be removed?
('93', 55, 1, 23, 115106) It is for the devotees of Malaviyaji to answer these questions.
('93', 55, 1, 24, 115170) Malaviyaji has left us his bequest.
('93', 55, 1, 25, 115206) To make it lasting and to develop it would be the right memorial for him.
('93', 55, 1, 26, 115280) Malaviyaji collected a great deal of money for the University, but a great deal still remains to be collected.
('93', 55, 1, 27, 115391) Everyone can make his contribution to this work.
('93', 55, 1, 28, 115440) So much for his outward activity.
('93', 55, 1, 29, 115474) His inner life was of the purest.
('93', 55, 1, 30, 115508) He was an ocean of kindness.
('93', 55, 1, 31, 115537) His knowledge of the Shastras was immense.
('93', 55, 1, 32, 115580) Bhagavata was his most favourite book.
('93', 55, 1, 33, 115619) He was a competent preacher.
('93', 55, 1, 34, 115648) His memory was prodigious.
('93', 55, 1, 35, 115675) His life was clean and simple.
('93', 55, 1, 36, 115706) I leave out his politics and his other manifold activities.
('93', 55, 1, 37, 115766) He whose life was dedicated to selfless service and who was endowed with so many gifts, could not be confined in his activities.
('93', 55, 1, 38, 115895) I have wanted to draw attention only to the most abiding of his works.
('93', 55, 1, 39, 115966) Those who wish to make of the University an institution full of purity, would better study, ponder and follow the ideals of Malaviyaji.

('93', 56, 3, 4, 116263) Beyond feeling still weak 2 and having skin eruptions I am feeling no ill effects of the recent reduction in diet.
('93', 56, 3, 5, 116378) This is the fourth day since I resumed taking milk.
('93', 56, 3, 6, 116430) Dr. Sushila Nayyar thinks that normal diet will remove skin eruptions which, she thinks, are due to lowered vitality, and restoration of normal strength is a matter of days now if I take care of myself otherwise.
('93', 56, 3, 7, 116643) Like the rest of my companions she has gone to a village near by.
('93', 56, 3, 8, 116709) I may add that my work has not suffered and I hope it will not have to suffer for my physical weakness.

('93', 56, 5, 11, 116873) CHANDIPUR, November 23, 1946
('93', 56, 6, 12, 116902) Gandhiji said his advice to them was that all must help in the work of the Peace Committee 3 that had been formed and strengthen its hands.
('93', 56, 6, 13, 117042) By staying out of the Committee and carrying on Press propaganda they would not be helping the cause.
('93', 56, 6, 14, 117144) He wanted to tell them his own experience in Champaran.
('93', 56, 6, 15, 117200) As a result of the struggle there, a Commission of Enquiry was appointed.
('93', 56, 6, 16, 117274) He was requested to become a member of the Commission unconditionally.
('93', 56, 6, 17, 117345) He consulted his friends and accepted the offer.
('93', 56, 6, 18, 117394) The result was that the indigo monopoly ended.
('93', 56, 6, 19, 117441) It was probably a century old wrong.
('93', 56, 6, 20, 117478) Seven times the labourers had rebelled before.
('93', 56, 6, 21, 117525) Each time the rebellion was put down ruthlessly, so that their condition was worse than before.
('93', 56, 7, 22, 117621) Similarly, let everyone join the Peace Committee and air his views before it.
('93', 56, 7, 23, 117699) Probably there would be redress of every legitimate grievance.
('93', 56, 8, 24, 117762) They had heard the speeches of Minister Shamsuddin Saheb, Parliamentary Secretary Hamiduddin Saheb and others.
('93', 56, 8, 25, 117873) They had requested the refugees to return to
('93', 56, 9, 26, 117918) 1 According to the report, Gandhiji made the statement prior to departure to Chandipur on this date.
('93', 56, 10, 27, 118019) 2 A report said that Gandhiji had had an attack of diarrhoea and vomiting while going by boat to Chandipur.
('93', 56, 10, 28, 118127) 3 Vide Extract from Diary, 22 11 1946. For a more detailed report of Gandhijis views on the subject, Vide Talk with Hindu Workers, 21 11 1946
('93', 57, 0, 1, 118269) 58 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('93', 57, 1, 2, 118310) their villages and had assured them that they would guarantee their safety and honour.
('93', 57, 1, 3, 118397) They should accept their assurance.
('93', 57, 2, 4, 118433) They might say all this was mere talk.
('93', 57, 2, 5, 118472) They had been deceived before.
('93', 57, 2, 6, 118503) It was beneath ones dignity to distrust a mans word without sufficient ground.
('93', 57, 2, 7, 118582) If all Muslims were liars, Islam could not be a true religion.
('93', 57, 2, 8, 118645) But his knowledge of history contradicted such a theory.
('93', 57, 2, 9, 118702) A false thing could not last long in this world.
('93', 57, 3, 10, 118751) Islam spread amongst crores of people all over the world.
('93', 57, 3, 11, 118809) It spread mostly because of its own intrinsic merits.
('93', 57, 3, 12, 118863) Here were elected Muslims who were running the Government of the Province who gave them their word of honour.
('93', 57, 3, 13, 118973) His advice to Hindus was to believe their word and give them a trial.
('93', 57, 3, 14, 119043) This did not mean that there would not be a single bad Mussalman left in East Bengal.
('93', 57, 3, 15, 119129) There were good and bad men amongst all communities.
('93', 57, 3, 16, 119182) Dishonourable conduct would break any ministry or organization in the end.
('93', 57, 3, 17, 119257) Shamsuddin Saheb had told them plainly that Pakistan could not be achieved by cruel deeds.
('93', 57, 3, 18, 119348) It was clear to him as daylight that if they kept quarrelling amongst themselves, a third power was bound to rule over them.
('93', 57, 3, 19, 119473) Whether it was British or Allied Powers, it made no difference.
('93', 57, 3, 20, 119537) They would remain slaves.
('93', 57, 4, 21, 119563) There was a time when Hindus and Muslims had been united.
('93', 57, 4, 22, 119621) There was the pact of unity between the League and the Congress in 1916. Whether it was good or bad was not the question.
('93', 57, 4, 23, 119743) He was a newcomer in India at that time and hardly knew anybody or affairs in this country.
('93', 57, 4, 24, 119835) Then came the Khilafat Movement and there was a communal unity that had never been seen before that.
('93', 57, 4, 25, 119936) Today Hindus were frightened when they heard the cries of Allah o Akbar.
('93', 57, 4, 26, 120009) In those days, these were the slogans repeated at all meetings: Vande mataram, Allah o Akbar and Sat Sri Akal.
('93', 57, 4, 27, 120120) Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs in their thousands shouted these slogans with one voice.
('93', 57, 4, 28, 120203) They were the same people today.
('93', 57, 4, 29, 120236) Those who were youngsters in those days were grown up men today.
('93', 57, 4, 30, 120301) Why could not they live together as friends now?
('93', 57, 4, 31, 120350) Gandhiji was not prepared to admit that bitterness had gone so deep that it could not be overcome.
('93', 57, 5, 32, 120449) The Peace Committee could not function without their help.
('93', 57, 5, 33, 120508) If they wanted real peace there was no other way except to have mutual trust and confidence.
('93', 57, 5, 34, 120601) Bihar, they said, had avenged Noakhali.
('93', 57, 5, 35, 120641) Supposing Muslims in East Bengal or Muslims all over India made up their minds to avenge Bihar, where would India be?
('93', 57, 6, 36, 120759) Gandhiji said that where houses had been burnt and destroyed, Government was, he understood, raising new ones.
('93', 57, 6, 37, 120870) If there were any difficulties or they were harassed in any way after they returned to their villages, they should place their complaints before the Peace Committee.
('93', 57, 7, 38, 121036) The speaker referred to a letter that had been handed to him during the meeting.
('93', 57, 7, 39, 121117) It was said that in Chandipur the damage amounted to a crore of rupees and it should be compensated.
('93', 57, 7, 40, 121218) He did not know whether it was a crore or a lakh.
('93', 57, 7, 41, 121268) But the Government
('93', 58, 0, 1, 121287) VOL. 93: 7 NOVEMBER, 1946 16 FEBRUARY, 1947 59
('93', 58, 1, 2, 121334) was bound to do what it could in such matters.
('93', 58, 2, 3, 121381) Then it was said in the letter that the Chief Ministers speeches breathed fire.
('93', 58, 2, 4, 121461) God alone knew the hearts of men.
('93', 58, 2, 5, 121495) He could not say whether Suhrawardy Saheb was a good man or a bad one.
('93', 58, 2, 6, 121566) But he knew that he was elected by the voters.
('93', 58, 2, 7, 121613) Hindus and Muslims had to live under his Government just as those in Bihar had to live under the rule of the Congress Government.
('93', 58, 2, 8, 121743) If people did not like a particular Government the electorate could change it.
('93', 58, 2, 9, 121822) But it was not in his power to do so.
('93', 58, 3, 10, 121860) The letter further said that the Superintendent of Police was a bad man and should be sent away from Noakhali.
('93', 58, 3, 11, 121971) Again, he did not know whether the Police Superintendent was a good man or bad.
('93', 58, 3, 12, 122051) But he had the confidence of his chief.
('93', 58, 3, 13, 122091) Gandhiji himself had come into contact with him fairly frequently during the last few days and he felt that the Superintendent would deny those charges if they were false, and express regret for his mistake if they were true.
('93', 58, 3, 14, 122317) But he wanted to tell them this.
('93', 58, 3, 15, 122350) If he was bad, it was so because the people of Noakhali were bad.
('93', 58, 3, 16, 122416) There were very few men who remained good in the midst of bad people.
('93', 58, 3, 17, 122486) All those in the Congress were not angels.
('93', 58, 4, 18, 122529) Then there was a request that the military must stay on.
('93', 58, 4, 19, 122586) According to the present constitution, the military had to act under the orders of the Ministers.
('93', 58, 4, 20, 122684) That was democracy.
('93', 58, 4, 21, 122704) When the Ministers themselves were offering to become their soldiers, why should they ask for the military?
('93', 58, 4, 22, 122812) After all, if the worst came to the worst they could only lose their lives.
('93', 58, 4, 23, 122888) They must do so as brave men and women.
('93', 58, 4, 24, 122928) By running away from East Bengal they would become the worst cowards.
('93', 58, 4, 25, 122998) He could never wish that for anybody.
('93', 58, 5, 26, 123036) If all Hindus were bad, Hinduism must be bad.
('93', 58, 5, 27, 123082) If all Muslims were bad, Islam must be bad.
('93', 58, 5, 28, 123126) But neither Hinduism nor Islam was bad.
('93', 58, 5, 29, 123166) Christ had said that he alone was His disciple who did His work, not he who merely called him Lord, Lord.
('93', 58, 5, 30, 123272) That applied to all religions.
('93', 58, 6, 31, 123303) If Shamsuddin Saheb and his companions did not mean what they said they would know.
('93', 58, 6, 32, 123387) Gandhiji for one did not wish to be a living witness of such a tragedy.
('93', 58, 6, 33, 123459) The Hindu, 28 11 1946

('93', 59, 1, 6, 123954) Massage was given by N. so that I was able to have a 40 minutes nap on the massage table.
('93', 59, 1, 7, 124044) Leafy vegetable served at midday was very bitter.
('93', 59, 1, 8, 124094) Took it with 1 oz.

('93', 59, 1, 10, 124130) Next unsuccessfully tried to have a little sleep  nausea and gripe.
('93', 59, 1, 11, 124198) Gave myself enema.

('93', 60, 1, 3, 125734) Hence I cannot assert that whatever is written in this book conforms to my thinking.
('93', 60, 1, 4, 125819) But I can certainly say that there is great similarity between my views and those stated in this book.
('93', 60, 1, 5, 125922) Appasaheb needs no certificate from me.
('93', 60, 1, 6, 125962) The source of his ideas may be my views, but their final form is entirely his own.
('93', 60, 1, 7, 126045) That only adds to the value of the book.
('93', 60, 1, 8, 126086) The readers, too, will find much material to ponder over and will be able to form their ideas independently.

('93', 61, 7, 13, 127130) SRIRAMPUR, [November 24, 1946] 3
('93', 61, 8, 14, 127163) Gandhiji agreed that the leaders had sunk to the lowest level, but not the common people.
('93', 61, 8, 15, 127253) Their hearts were still sound.
('93', 61, 8, 16, 127284) He added : Even in this village I have noticed some response.
('93', 61, 8, 17, 127346) But, of course, I do not build upon it.
('93', 61, 9, 18, 127386) BOSE: We believe your attempt is to raise humanity from the lowest level.
('93', 61, 9, 19, 127460) But we are sceptical as to whether you will succeed.
('93', 61, 10, 20, 127513) GANDHIJI: I myself am sceptical about it.
('93', 61, 10, 21, 127555) I may succeed, I can perish in the attempt.
('93', 61, 10, 22, 127599) Success or failure is not the final test.
('93', 61, 11, 23, 127641) B. You are right.
('93', 61, 12, 24, 127659) G. And attempt up to the last is the only real test.
('93', 61, 13, 25, 127712) Bose next asked Gandhiji if there was any change of mentality on the part of
('93', 61, 14, 26, 127789) 1 Shailen Chatterjee 2 This appeared under the title At Srirampur by Pyarelal, who in Mahatma GandhiThe Last Phase says: Early in the morning of November 24, Sarat Chandra Bose .
('93', 61, 14, 27, 127968) Bengal Congress leader, with a number of friends from Calcutta had a two hour talk with Gandhiji at Srirampur in regard to the Governments peace proposals.
('93', 61, 14, 28, 128124) In My Days with Gandhi, p.
('93', 61, 14, 29, 128151) 67, N. K. Bose says that Chapalakanta Bhattacharya, Editor, Anand Bazar Patrika, Debnath Das, Capt.
('93', 61, 14, 30, 128251) Razik, Lieut.
('93', 61, 14, 31, 128265) Samson of the Indian National Army and another local friend accompanied S. C. Bose.
('93', 62, 0, 1, 128349) VOL. 93: 7 NOVEMBER, 1946 16 FEBRUARY, 1947 63
('93', 62, 1, 2, 128396) the authorities.
('93', 62, 1, 3, 128413) Gandhiji replied : There is a change in the Government policy for the better.
('93', 62, 1, 4, 128491) But as for the change of heart, it is for you and me to make a contribution to that consummation.
('93', 62, 2, 5, 128589) The interviewer remarked that it was painful to see how listless the Hindus had become.
('93', 62, 2, 6, 128677) Gandhiji replied : It is no prerogative of the Hindus.
('93', 62, 2, 7, 128732) Listlessness is common to us all.
('93', 62, 2, 8, 128766) Even if I am the only one, I shall fight this listlessness that has come over the Hindus of East Bengal.
('93', 62, 2, 9, 128871) I have not come here to do a good turn to this community or that.
('93', 62, 2, 10, 128937) I have come to do a good turn to myself.
('93', 62, 2, 11, 128978) Non violence is not meant to be practised by the individual only.
('93', 62, 2, 12, 129044) It can be and has to be practised by society as a whole.
('93', 62, 2, 13, 129101) I have come to test that for myself in Noakhali.
('93', 62, 2, 14, 129150) Has my ahimsa become bankrupt?
('93', 62, 2, 15, 129181) If I fail here, it wont be any proof that the theory is wrong.
('93', 62, 2, 16, 129244) It will simply mean that my sadhana has been imperfect, that there is some fault somewhere in my technique.
('93', 62, 3, 17, 129352) B. If the League leaders were to take the Noakhali situation as seriously as you and Jawaharlal took Bihar, order would be restored in a day.
('93', 62, 3, 18, 129494) To make such comparisons is to degrade oneself.
('93', 62, 3, 19, 129542) What is called for is introspection and more introspection.
('93', 62, 3, 20, 129602) I have come here not only to speak to the Mussalmans but to the Hindus as well.
('93', 62, 3, 21, 129682) Why are they such cowards?
('93', 62, 3, 22, 129709) The Harijans, the Namashudras, have been relatively better so far as courage and physical prowess is concerned.
('93', 62, 3, 23, 129821) They are brave.
('93', 62, 3, 24, 129837) But the other Hindus must shed utterly the caste distinctions.
('93', 62, 3, 25, 129900) If this calamity would open the eyes of the Hindus and result in eradicating untouchability root and branch, it will have served a good purpose.
('93', 62, 4, 26, 130045) Narrating his earlier experiences in India he recalled how during the Champaran Satyagraha, in Rajendra Babus absence, he could only sit in the outhouse in Rajendra Babus house and how Rajendra Babus servant would not let the speaker bathe at the well.
('93', 62, 4, 27, 130298) Things had improved, but much more remained to be done.
('93', 62, 5, 28, 130354) The visitor agreed that Hinduism had still to go a long way to eradicate the evil.
('93', 62, 5, 29, 130437) Talking of forced conversions in Noakhali, the interviewer remarked that unless those who had been converted were brought back to the Hindu fold quickly, the cleavage between the Hindus and the Muslims might become permanent.
('93', 62, 6, 30, 130663) G. Many had returned.
('93', 62, 6, 31, 130685) But all must.
('93', 62, 7, 32, 130699) The question was put to him whether by taking up an unbending attitude on conversion, he was not identifying himself with one particular community.
('93', 63, 0, 1, 130847) 64 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('93', 63, 1, 2, 130888) could his stand in this respect be squared with his claim that he regarded all religions as equal?
('93', 63, 2, 3, 130987) G. I have, of course, always believed in the principle of religious tolerance.
('93', 63, 2, 4, 131066) But I have even gone further.
('93', 63, 2, 5, 131096) I have advanced from tolerance to equal respect for all religions.
('93', 63, 2, 6, 131163) All religions are branches of the same mighty tree, but I must not change over from one branch to another for the sake of expediency.
('93', 63, 2, 7, 131297) By doing so, I cut the branch on which I am sitting.
('93', 63, 2, 8, 131350) Therefore, I always feel the change over from one religion to another very keenly, unless it is a case of spontaneous urge, a result of inner growth.
('93', 63, 2, 9, 131500) Such conversions by their very nature cannot be on a mass scale and never to save ones life or property or for temporal gain.
('93', 63, 3, 10, 131626) He narrated his meeting with a South Indian Bishop who was a Harijan converted to Christianity and retained all his original weakness in spite of the change of religion.
('93', 63, 3, 11, 131796) He had told the late Charlie Andrews that to his mind he was no bishop at all.
('93', 63, 4, 12, 131875) B. There is no end to the monstrosities that have been committed here and that too in the name of religion.
('93', 63, 4, 13, 131983) It is enough to fill one with blank despair.
('93', 63, 5, 14, 132028) G. I have met human monsters from my early youth.
('93', 63, 5, 15, 132078) I have found that even they are not beyond redemption if we know how to touch the right chord in their soul.
('93', 63, 6, 16, 132187) And he cited two instances within his recent experience of the milk of human kindness welling up in hard boiled, sun baked functionaries at the sight of stark human misery and devastation.
('93', 63, 7, 17, 132376) G. The whole thing is so ghastly.
('93', 63, 7, 18, 132410) You do not need to exa ggerate it.
('93', 63, 7, 19, 132445) I have told the authorities I do not care for numbers.
('93', 63, 7, 20, 132500) Has a single case of abduction, rape, forcible marriage, or forcible conver sion occurred?
('93', 63, 7, 21, 132591) If so, it is enough for me.
('93', 63, 7, 22, 132619) It is admitted that such things have happened.
('93', 63, 8, 23, 132666) B. What about the rescue of abducted women?
('93', 63, 8, 24, 132710) It was complained that as soon as information was received about such cases and the rescue party with the military police set out on their assignment, the miscreants received intimation and removed the victim to some other place.
('93', 63, 9, 25, 132940) G. I have told our people :Do not depend on military and the police help. You have to uphold democracy, and democracy and dependence on the military and the police are incompatible.
('93', 63, 9, 26, 133122) You cannot say it is good in one place and bad in another.
('93', 63, 9, 27, 133181) Military help
('93', 63, 10, 28, 133195) 1 This paragraph is reproduced from Mahatma GandhiThe Last Phase.

('93', 64, 1, 2, 133308) will degrade you.
('93', 64, 1, 3, 133326) 1 In a democracy, if you set up a hooligan as the head of the Government, you lie in the bed you have made.
('93', 64, 1, 4, 133434) The only remedy is to educate and convert the electorate by satyagraha, if necessary.
('93', 64, 1, 5, 133520) We should be consistent all along.
('93', 64, 1, 6, 133555) If democracy is good in Bihar, it ought to be good in Bengal, too.
('93', 64, 1, 7, 133622) I must, therefore, go to the popular, elected Ministers, for they are my Ministers.
('93', 64, 1, 8, 133706) If they fail, public opinion must be created to replace them.
('93', 64, 1, 9, 133768) That is de mocracy.
('93', 64, 1, 10, 133788) Whether it is Bihar or Bengal, the people have to be brave and stand on their legs.
('93', 64, 1, 11, 133872) I want everyone to die at his post like a brave man and not to leave his home or his village.
('93', 64, 2, 12, 133966) Another interviewer 2 asked Gandhiji why Pandit Jawaharlal went to Bihar and took such an active part in putting down disturbances there while he did nothing for Bengal.
('93', 64, 2, 13, 134136) If the Interim Government could not interfere in one Province because of provincial autonomy, how could it do so in another?
('93', 64, 3, 14, 134261) Gandhiji replied that they must not forget that besides being the Vice President of the Interim Government, Jawaharlal was the first servant of the Congress.
('93', 64, 3, 15, 134419) As the Vice President of the Central Cabinet, he must act within the four corners of the constitution.
('93', 64, 3, 16, 134522) It does not permit interference with provincial autonomy.
('93', 64, 3, 17, 134580) But in Bihar, Pandit Nehru and Rajendra Babu have a standing and responsibility as Congressmen.
('93', 64, 4, 18, 134676) One of the interviewers remarked that Bengal was being used as a pawn on the political chess board.
('93', 64, 5, 19, 134776) Bengal is in the forefront today because Bengal is Bengal.
('93', 64, 5, 20, 134835) It is Bengal that produced Tagore and Bankim Chandra.
('93', 64, 5, 21, 134889) It was here that the heroes of the Chittagong Armoury Raid were born, however misguided their action might have been in my eyes.
('93', 64, 5, 22, 135018) No, you must understand it.
('93', 64, 5, 23, 135046) If Bengal plays the game, it will solve all Indias problem.
('93', 64, 5, 24, 135106) That is why I have made myself a Bengali.
('93', 64, 5, 25, 135148) 3 I have seen enough of ravages in Noakhali to make me weep my eyes out but I am not going to shed a tear for what has happened.
('93', 64, 5, 26, 135277) We have a long way yet to go.
('93', 64, 5, 27, 135307) Why should there be cowardice in the Bengal of such men?
('93', 64, 6, 28, 135364) B. Yes, when I see these desecrated places of worship, I ask, why did not every man, woman and child of the house die there before those places were touched.
('93', 64, 7, 29, 135522) 1 The following six sentences are reproduced from Mahatma GandhiThe Last Phase.
('93', 64, 7, 30, 135602) 2 Chapalakanta Bhattacharya 3 The following two sentences are reproduced from Mahatma GandhiThe Last Phase.
('93', 65, 0, 1, 135710) 66 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('93', 65, 1, 2, 135751) Q. If they had done that, you would not have required any other help.
('93', 65, 1, 3, 135821) Today Noakhali is bereft of its leading men.
('93', 65, 1, 4, 135866) They refused to take the risk and have left their hearths and homes.
('93', 65, 1, 5, 135935) Poor Manoranjan Babu is in a fix.
('93', 65, 1, 6, 135969) Whom is he to put on the Peace Committees?
('93', 65, 1, 7, 136012) I have told him that the common man must rise to fill the vacuum.
('93', 65, 1, 8, 136078) There is no such thing as a vacuum in nature.
('93', 65, 1, 9, 136124) Nature abhors it.
('93', 65, 1, 10, 136142) Let him write to them, I have told him.
('93', 65, 1, 11, 136182) If they come back, well and good.
('93', 65, 1, 12, 136216) Otherwise, the common man must come forward.
('93', 65, 1, 13, 136261) It is his day.
('93', 65, 2, 14, 136276) Q. Mahatmaji, tell us in one word, whether it is war or peace?
('93', 65, 2, 15, 136339) Peace Committees or War Committees?
('93', 65, 2, 16, 136375) G. Peace Committees.
('93', 65, 2, 17, 136396) War results when peace fails.
('93', 65, 2, 18, 136426) Our effort must always be directed towards peace, but it must be peace with honour and fair security for life and property.
('93', 65, 2, 19, 136550) On these two conditions alone will the refugees return.
('93', 65, 2, 20, 136606) Of course, if they develop enough courage, they will return without any safeguards.
('93', 65, 2, 21, 136690) Today I have suggested one Hindu and one Muslim standing surety for each village.
('93', 65, 2, 22, 136772) If the people have the requisite courage, they would depend on none but God and their own strength of spirit for their defence.
('93', 65, 2, 23, 136900) If they do that, all the goondas in Noakhali will feel the change in the atmosphere and behave decently.
('93', 65, 2, 24, 137005) I know what I am saying.
('93', 65, 2, 25, 137030) I come from Kathiawad, a Province notorious for its bandits.
('93', 65, 2, 26, 137091) I know that they are not beyond redemption.
('93', 65, 2, 27, 137135) Nor do I believe that goondas are responsible for all that had happened.
('93', 65, 3, 28, 137208) A suggestion was next made as to why they should not have only Muslims in the Peace Committees as the Hindus had played no part in breaking the peace.
('93', 65, 3, 29, 137359) The Hindus must be there to play their part, else the Peace Committees will be a farce.
('93', 65, 4, 30, 137447) B. Was it not possible no control Bihar with non violence?
('93', 65, 4, 31, 137506) Why did the Congress Ministers resort to the free use of Military there?
('93', 65, 5, 32, 137579) G. Yes.
('93', 65, 5, 33, 137587) But Bihar has been having a lesson in organized violence since 1942 and before.
('93', 65, 5, 34, 137667) Our weakness for the goondas rose to the highest in 1942. I know the merits of 1942. The people were not
('93', 65, 6, 35, 137772) 1 In Mahatma GandhiThe Last Phase Pyarelal says During the morning walk in which Sarat Bose joined, Gandhiji remarked that he was beginning to feel that even if Muslim workers were not forthcoming for his peace mission, Hindus alone might do.
('93', 65, 6, 36, 138015) A handful of such workers, if they were worthy of their salt, could turn the tide.
('93', 65, 6, 37, 138098) The only condition was that the local Hindus should play the game.
('93', 65, 6, 38, 138165) The least that he expected of them was that they should eradicate the curse of untouchability root and branch from their midst.
('93', 65, 6, 39, 138293) Otherwise they would never come into their own. 2 This question is reproduced from Mahatma GandhiThe Last Phase.

('93', 66, 1, 3, 138465) But all the same I cannot shut my eyes to our mistakes.

('93', 66, 4, 8, 138778) Such was Shamsuddin Sahebs order.
('93', 66, 4, 9, 138812) But wherever I may happen to be, my heart is here.
('93', 66, 4, 10, 138863) I can have no peace until the Muslim brothers and sisters of the village call back the Hindus who used to live here, and they return to their homes.
('93', 66, 4, 11, 139012) They should treat this as a duty and try to fulfil it.

('93', 66, 6, 15, 139173) It is good that you have written and given me the news.
('93', 66, 6, 16, 139229) If you want to go to Vinoba, you may.
('93', 66, 6, 17, 139267) But your first task is to improve your health.

('93', 66, 9, 24, 139524) 82. SPEECH AT PEACE COMMITTEE MEETING RAMGUNJ, November 25, 1946 Brothers, I had no desire to speak to you tonight, for, as you see, my voice is still very weak.
('93', 66, 9, 25, 139686) Let me hope that your work will proceed well.
('93', 66, 9, 26, 139732) But there are indications that trouble is brewing even now.
('93', 66, 10, 27, 139792) 1 It being a silence day, the speech was read out.
('93', 66, 10, 28, 139843) 2 There had been a communal riot there on the occasion of an annual fair on November 8, and a large number of people had been killed.
('93', 67, 0, 1, 139977) 68 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('93', 67, 1, 2, 140018) have just received a wire from Sandwip and some more complaints which tend to show that all is not well.
('93', 67, 1, 3, 140123) I am handing them over to Shamsuddin Saheb for enquiry and necessary action, if the reports prove true.
('93', 67, 1, 4, 140227) With regard to the Peace Committees formed in villages, 1 a complaint has reached me that some of the Muslim members on the Committees are not reliable.
('93', 67, 1, 5, 140380) The Hindus stand in fear of them but have not the courage to speak out openly.
('93', 67, 1, 6, 140459) But unless they muster such courage, and if wrong people are left there, the Committees will not be able to command confidence.
('93', 67, 1, 7, 140587) What we really want is the right sort of person.
('93', 67, 1, 8, 140636) My suggestion is that if two good and brave men, one a Hindu and another a Mussalman, take the responsibility of prevent ing mischief even at the cost of their life, that would be enough.
('93', 67, 1, 9, 140824) Why should there be eagerness for entering the Committees?
('93', 67, 1, 10, 140883) It is not a place for acquiring position or honour but a place of service, and if anyone really wishes to serve, he can as well serve outside as on the Committee.
('93', 67, 1, 11, 141046) It is only in order to serve the cause of Islam that the Muslims are being called to join the Committees.
('93', 67, 1, 12, 141152) The most important task is to restore the confidence among the Hindus so that they would be able to pursue their religious practices in freedom.
('93', 67, 1, 13, 141297) Mr. Akhil Dutta has lately sent me a cheque for Rs. 850 and a letter stating that 200 pairs of conch shell bangles and a pound of vermilion had been despatched to Noakhali.
('93', 67, 1, 14, 141470) These are for distribution among women who had suffered during the riots.
('93', 67, 1, 15, 141544) The best part of the presents is that they were collected by eleven Muslim gentlemen and one Engli shman.
('93', 67, 1, 16, 141650) I have met women who put on the vermilion mark indoors but wipe it off when they stir out in public.
('93', 67, 1, 17, 141751) Such fear has to be removed by the Muslims.
('93', 67, 1, 18, 141795) It is not a question of giving monetary aid, but of restoring confidence by respect shown to the culture of others.
('93', 67, 1, 19, 141911) I will ask my Mussalman friends to treat this as their sacred duty.
('93', 67, 1, 20, 141979) The Prophet once advised Mussalmans to consider the Jewish places of worship to be as pure as their own and offer it the same protection.
('93', 67, 1, 21, 142117) It is the duty of the Mussalmans of today to assure the same freedom to their Hindu neighbours.
('93', 67, 1, 22, 142213) Qaid e Azam Jinnah has said that every Muslim must show by his conduct that not a single non Muslim need be afraid of him, the latter would be guaranteed safety and protection.
('93', 67, 2, 23, 142390) 1 Shamsuddin Ahmed, who was present, had announced that seven Peace Committees had been formed.

('93', 68, 5, 7, 142750) I am in an out of the way village, quite happy but a little run down owing to the silly mistake I made in taking a very bitter bhaji.

('93', 68, 9, 17, 143263) Nirmal Kumar 1 Bose and Parasuram as my companions.
('93', 68, 9, 18, 143315) The people with whom I am putting up are gentlemen.
('93', 68, 9, 19, 143367) There is only one Hindu family in the entire village, the rest are all Muslims.
('93', 68, 9, 20, 143447) They all stay widely separated from each other.
('93', 68, 9, 21, 143495) The hundreds of villages here do not maintain much contact with each other through any convey ance after the water dries up.
('93', 68, 9, 22, 143620) The result is that work is possible only on foot.
('93', 68, 9, 23, 143670) Therefore, only desperadoes, hooligans, or able bodied men can maintain contact among themselves.
('93', 68, 9, 24, 143768) I am living in one such village at present and intend to spend more time in another village similar to this.
('93', 68, 9, 25, 143877) It is my intention to stay on here so long as the Hindus and Muslims do not start living together as sincere friends.

('93', 69, 1, 5, 144211) This will test my non violence, too.
('93', 69, 1, 6, 144248) I have come here determined to emerge successful from this ordeal.
('93', 69, 1, 7, 144315) If you are anxious to see me, then you can come over here.
('93', 69, 1, 8, 144374) I personally do not see any necessity for it.
('93', 69, 1, 9, 144420) If you wish to send a messenger to know something or carry letters by hand, you can do so.
('93', 69, 1, 10, 144511) I am not going into the Constituent Assembly; it is not quite necessary either.
('93', 69, 1, 11, 144591) Jawaharlal, Sardar, Rajendra Babu, Rajaji, Maulana any of these or all five can goor Kripalani.
('93', 69, 1, 12, 144687) Send them the message.
('93', 69, 1, 13, 144710) If it is possible to arrange for a sitting of the Constituent Assembly only with the help of the military, then it is better not to have it.
('93', 69, 1, 14, 144851) If it can be arranged peacefully, then the laws can be framed only for the participating Provinces.
('93', 69, 1, 15, 144951) Let us see what the future of the police and the military will be.
('93', 69, 1, 16, 145018) We have also to see what the Muslim majority Provinces will do, and what is to be done in the Provinces where Muslims are in minority, how the British Government will conduct itself, and how the Princes will react.
('93', 69, 1, 17, 145233) I believe the State Paper of May 16 will probably have to be changed.
('93', 69, 1, 18, 145303) The job is complicated enough, if we want to work independently.
('93', 69, 1, 19, 145368) I have only given an indication of how I view the problem.
('93', 69, 1, 20, 145427) Friends will also do well to bear in mind that what I am doing here is not in the name of the Congress.
('93', 69, 1, 21, 145531) Nor is there any thought of associating it with this work.
('93', 69, 1, 22, 145590) What I am doing is only from my personal view of non violence.
('93', 69, 1, 23, 145653) Anybody, if he so desires, can publicly oppose my work.
('93', 69, 1, 24, 145709) That in fact is his right; it may even be his duty.
('93', 69, 1, 25, 145761) Therefore, whosoever wishes to do anything or say anything, let him do so fearlessly.
('93', 69, 1, 26, 145847) If anybody wants to warn me of anything, let him do that too.
('93', 69, 1, 27, 145909) Please send a copy of this to Sardar so that he may tell the others named above.
('93', 69, 1, 28, 145990) Or you can get copies made and send them to the five friends yourself.

('93', 70, 6, 12, 146870) November 26, 1946
('93', 70, 7, 13, 146888) Gandhiji stated that he was personally cast in a different mould; when he had no confidence in a particular step, he never took it.
('93', 70, 7, 14, 147020) Under the present circumstances, he did not think that the step suggested by the friends would be of any use.
('93', 70, 7, 15, 147130) Personally, he was trying to have everything done through the Ministry.
('93', 70, 7, 16, 147202) He had also undertaken a programme here all by himself and this was without the co operation of the tallest in Bengal.
('93', 70, 7, 17, 147321) The Hindu population in Bengal could co operate by utterly forgetting caste, not as mere lip profession but in actual practice.
('93', 70, 7, 18, 147449) They had also to purge themselves of all fear.
('93', 70, 7, 19, 147496) For, it is only when a mans heart is freed from fear that the flower of religion can find a place in it.
('93', 70, 7, 20, 147601) Finally he added : I do not want to retire from Bengal as a defeated coward.
('93', 70, 7, 21, 147678) I would like to die here, if need be, at the hands of an assassin.
('93', 70, 7, 22, 147745) But I do not want to court such death.

('93', 70, 9, 25, 147934) As he sat basking in the sun outside his room, they reported that people apprehended fresh trouble on December 9, when the Constituent Assembly was to begin work.
('93', 70, 9, 26, 148097) They had gone to Hamiduddin Ahmed for assurance, but had been advised by him to wait for the direction of the League High Command in this connection.
('93', 70, 9, 27, 148247) The friends suggested that Gandhiji should convene an all parties meeting in the district and co ordinate the work done severally by various organizations.

('93', 71, 2, 3, 148473) SRIRAMPUR, November 26, 1946
('93', 71, 3, 4, 148502) Gandhiji said that even if a solitary refugee had to return to his village populated by Muslims, he would unhesitatingly advise his return.
('93', 71, 3, 5, 148642) Whe ther they were men or women, if they were to become brave people, this cour age was indispensable.
('93', 71, 3, 6, 148745) Numerous letters had been coming to him in which people had questioned the wisdom of thus tempting faith, but he held that this was necessary if they were to become a self respecting nation.
('93', 71, 3, 7, 148936) He made no distinction between men and women.
('93', 71, 3, 8, 148982) The latter should feel just as independent as men.
('93', 71, 3, 9, 149033) Bravery was not mans monopoly.
('93', 71, 3, 10, 149064) The art of self defence excluded all outside help.
('93', 71, 3, 11, 149115) What he saw and heard showed him that people were apt to forget self respect in order to save themselves.
('93', 71, 3, 12, 149221) There was no swadesh and swaraj for persons who would not sacrifice themselves or their belongings for their honour.
('93', 71, 3, 13, 149338) As his hearers knew, the Ministers and the Parliamentary Secretaries, who had come to Noakhali, had been proclaiming that for the sake of their honour and the influence of Islam, they were anxious that the refugees should return to their villages and feel perfectly safe and serene in the midst of the majority of Muslims living there.
('93', 71, 3, 14, 149674) The speaker had no hesitation in trusting their pledged word and asking the people to do likewise.
('93', 71, 3, 15, 149773) Those who trusted were never the losers; deceivers ever were.
('93', 71, 3, 16, 149835) There was no room for goondaism in any religion worth the name, be it Islam, Hinduism or any other.
('93', 71, 3, 17, 149935) He was trying to become a Bengali in order that if God gave him strength, he might try to live the life in the midst of the people of East Bengal and induce them to do likewise.

('93', 71, 6, 21, 150179) If the refugees had the required spirit of co operation, it would be possible.
('93', 71, 6, 22, 150258) But it is a plant of slow growth and personal courage does not come even from co operation.
('93', 71, 6, 23, 150350) It comes when it does come, because it is a virtue which is its own reward.

('93', 71, 7, 26, 150586) The addressee had suggested that in order to restore their self confidence the refugees instead of living separately should live and work together in one or two selected badis.

('93', 72, 1, 4, 150942) Those who came with me from Sevagram are following suit.
('93', 72, 1, 5, 150999) Whether they will prove themselves worthy of the great trust reposed in them remains to be seen.
('93', 72, 1, 6, 151096) That may be said even about myself.
('93', 72, 1, 7, 151132) Only I am not following anybody but am the originator so far as I am concerned, of the idea.
('93', 72, 1, 8, 151225) Therefore, if you have any volunteers in view with the requisite qualifications, please send me their names and addresses.
('93', 72, 2, 9, 151348) He did not want to make a public appeal, he explained, because the right quality of men and women would not come in answer to an advertisement.
('93', 72, 2, 10, 151492) They have to be persons of sterling worth and equally high courage.
('93', 72, 2, 11, 151560) 1 full of ahimsa, i.
('93', 72, 2, 12, 151581) e., respect for the Muslims.
('93', 72, 2, 13, 151610) It would be a pity if these volunteers started with distrust.
('93', 72, 2, 14, 151672) Real courage is based on trust which is the surest foundation for it.
('93', 72, 3, 15, 151742) Besides, if he allowed volunteers, who might be attracted by the glamour of his presence to inundate Noakhali, it would create unhealthy excitement and cause the authorities and the local Muslims unnecessary trepidation.
('93', 72, 3, 16, 151963) To make an individual act non violently he has to be put absolutely at his ease first.
('93', 72, 3, 17, 152050) Meticulously correct conduct on their part would put the local Muslims and the Bengal Government on their honour.
('93', 72, 3, 18, 152164) He concluded : I am watching what the Government are doing.
('93', 72, 3, 19, 152224) People cannot be compelled to return to their villages.
('93', 72, 3, 20, 152280) It would be a disastrous experiment in my opinion.

('93', 73, 7, 16, 153420) SRIRAMPUR, November 27, 1946
('93', 73, 8, 17, 153449) QUESTION: How do you think lasting peace can be achieved by your new plan, unless the Muslim League itself which presumably guides the majority of the Muslim intelligentsia, sincerely co operates in creating such atmosphere by their words and deeds?
('93', 73, 9, 18, 153699) GANDHIJI: My new plan does contemplate the necessity for a lasting peace and sincere co operation of the Muslim League in establishing friendly relations between the two communities, irrespec tive of the merits or otherwise of Pakistan.
('93', 73, 10, 19, 153936) Asked as to what was the guarantee that some months later this sort of calamity would not be repeated in places like Noakhali, where Hindus were in a minority, Gandhiji said : The only real guarantee is to be sought in the personal courage of individuals.
('93', 73, 10, 20, 154192) Everything else depends on it.
('93', 73, 11, 21, 154223) The next question asked was whether he should not advise people in those areas where one or two houses were Hindu and the rest Muslim, to migrate to areas inside a district where the Hindus were in comparatively larger numbers, so that in case of emergencies they could put up some sort of resistance if they did not believe in non violence.
('93', 73, 11, 22, 154565) Gandhijis reply was:

('93', 74, 1, 2, 154695) There is no such safety as you imagine in numbers in imagined conditions.
('93', 74, 1, 3, 154769) Migration is no remedy whilst there is hope of co operation.
('93', 74, 1, 4, 154830) It will become a necessity when the majority party wishes it, if a clash is to be avoided.
('93', 74, 1, 5, 154921) All this is a matter of mutual adjustment, not arbitrary action.
('93', 74, 1, 6, 154986) What is needed is that barbarities must cease, if we are to survive as one nation or two, or many free nations still living in friendly co operation.

('93', 75, 2, 3, 156303) SRIRAMPUR, November 28, 1946
('93', 75, 3, 4, 156332) Gandhiji related the story of how the Ashram prayer had taken its present shape.
('93', 75, 3, 5, 156413) When he came to India in 1915, Gurudev invited him through the late Deenabandhu Andrews to stay at Santiniketan along with the inmates of the Phoenix Settlement.
('93', 75, 3, 6, 156575) Kaka Saheb and Harihar Sharma were there and so were the late Deenabandhu Andrews and Pearson.
('93', 75, 3, 7, 156670) These friends had created a sort of South African group at the place.
('93', 75, 3, 8, 156740) The prayer which was recited at that early time by the small group practically continues to this day so far as the Sanskrit part is concerned.
('93', 75, 4, 9, 156883) While on his Harijan tour in Travancore, he added the first Hindu verse of the Ishopanishad to it, as, in his opinion, it contained the cream of spiritual thought.
('93', 75, 4, 10, 157047) Later on, Raihana Tyabjee, daughter of the late Abbas Tyabjee, who is noted for her musical talents, proposed the incorporation of a passage from the Koran, and this was done.
('93', 75, 4, 11, 157223) Lastly, on Kasturbas death 1 at the Aga Khan Palace, Dr. Gilder 2 had recited a passage from the Zoroastrian scripture.
('93', 75, 4, 12, 157343) Since then that prayer has been a part of the Ashram prayer.
('93', 75, 4, 13, 157404) In addition there was a bhajan in an Indian language or an English hymn and Ramdhun.
('93', 75, 5, 14, 157489) The prayer which has thus taken shape can, on no account, be considered as belonging to any single community or religion.
('93', 75, 5, 15, 157611) It is of universal appeal; and no one, whatever his denomination may be, should have hesitation in sharing it.

('93', 75, 8, 19, 157809) DEAR FRIEND, I fear that I have neglected your question for a long time.
('93', 75, 8, 20, 157882) You know the reason why.
('93', 75, 8, 21, 157907) Many of my activities, including important correspondence, are held up and must remain so for the time being.
('93', 75, 8, 22, 158017) Meanwhile I pick up what comes uppermost for the moment.

('93', 76, 10, 21, 159321) You will thereby be helping Gordhandas 2. If you make up your mind, you can certainly get well in Sevagram.

('93', 77, 1, 4, 159783) If so, write to me.
('93', 77, 1, 5, 159803) Now about your letter.
('93', 77, 1, 6, 159826) When I repeat Ramanama, or even otherwise, I have no definite image in my mind.
('93', 77, 1, 7, 159906) I do not believe in such image worship.
('93', 77, 1, 8, 159946) In fact God is without form.
('93', 77, 1, 9, 159975) There is no need at all to invest Him with a form while worshipping Him.
('93', 77, 1, 10, 160048) We must believe God to be the absolute Truth and worship Him.
('93', 77, 1, 11, 160110) He is both the law and the law giver.
('93', 77, 1, 12, 160148) If this sinks in ones mind, there is nothing more to think about.
('93', 77, 1, 13, 160214) This being so, if you ask what more does one gain by repeating His name, my answer is that, as the saying is, a man becomes what he thinks.
('93', 77, 1, 14, 160354) By repeating His name, we become one with Him.
('93', 77, 1, 15, 160401) Your mind keeps changing.
('93', 77, 1, 16, 160427) But dont worry.
('93', 77, 1, 17, 160443) Keep on ceaselessly repeating the name, so that no other thoughts may enter the mind.
('93', 77, 1, 18, 160529) I know it is difficult for the sick to do this.
('93', 77, 1, 19, 160577) Do not worry about it.
('93', 77, 1, 20, 160600) If that repetition is diligently done, it sinks in ones heart and proves an unfailing remedy even for the sick.
('93', 77, 1, 21, 160712) Do not, therefore, think further but stay on there.
('93', 77, 1, 22, 160764) Cling to nature cure remedies and to Rama, and everything will be all right.
('93', 77, 1, 23, 160841) I hope Anand 1 is well.

('93', 79, 8, 13, 163583) I am writing this from Bardoli .
('93', 79, 8, 14, 163616) This year, during the Gandhi Jayanti week, nearly 40 public wells have been freely opened for the Harijans.
('93', 79, 8, 15, 163724) People have taken to this programme of their own will .
('93', 79, 8, 16, 163780) local people have invited Harijans and taken them to the public wells.
('93', 79, 8, 17, 163851) I myself have attended some functions and personally have become a witness to the marvellous change.
('93', 79, 8, 18, 163952) No doubt, it is Gandhijis efforts and the recent writings that have brought this change.
('93', 79, 8, 19, 164041) Numerous inter communal dinners have been held.
('93', 79, 8, 20, 164089) There was one such big dinner at Nadiad, the real capital of the Kaira District.
('93', 79, 8, 21, 164170) One prominent well has been opened in Kadi, a citadel of orthodoxy and 150 people dined with Harijans at Padra in Baroda.
('93', 79, 8, 22, 164292) There are numerous such incidents but I cannot enumerate them at present.
('93', 79, 8, 23, 164366) Of course, compared to what we want to achieve, this pro gress is a miserable show.
('93', 79, 8, 24, 164450) But seeing that Gujarat has been so far behindhand in this matter of removal of untouchability, the little progress of which Shri Parikshitlal takes note with pardonable

('93', 80, 6, 24, 166196) I shall try to do whatever I can in order to bring together the hearts of Hindus and Muslims who have lived so long together as friends and brothers and sisters.
('93', 80, 6, 25, 166358) But what I shall be able to do is more than I can answer.

('93', 81, 2, 5, 166739) People will not then be able to leave these villages even if they want to do so.
('93', 81, 2, 6, 166820) Would you ask them to stay on, or do you want them to leave at once?
('93', 81, 2, 7, 166889) GANDHIJI: I have said at many meetings I have addressed in this part of the country that if the people are brave, whether they are few or many, they will not leave their homes, but will remain there, whatever the risk.
('93', 81, 2, 8, 167108) And this I say irrespective of military or police protection.
('93', 81, 2, 9, 167170) It is beneath the dignity of free men or those wanting to be free, to seek such protection.
('93', 81, 2, 10, 167262) Surely during the past few days much has happened to encourage people to remain in their homes.

('93', 81, 4, 13, 167447) Gandhiji explained the meaning of the first mantra recited in the Ashram prayer: Namyo Horenge Kyo.
('93', 81, 4, 14, 167547) Its purport is, Salutation to the Enlightened Ones. A Japanese Buddhist monk 1 who had happened to stay in Sevagram for two or three years was responsible for its introduction.
('93', 81, 4, 15, 167724) He had come to India with the object of mastering the secrets of the religion which had its origin in India.
('93', 81, 4, 16, 167833) The monk had a sweet nature and had endeared himself to every member of the Sevagram Ashram by unostentatiousness, affableness and silence.
('93', 81, 4, 17, 167973) Every morning he used to walk round the Ashram grounds for full one hour, while beating upon a drum and reciting the above mantra in a deep musical voice which sent a thrill into all those who heard him.
('93', 81, 4, 18, 168177) He used to recite it at the prayer meeting.
('93', 81, 4, 19, 168221) The recitation continued even after he was removed by the Government after hostilities with Japan began.

('93', 82, 1, 12, 169367) No conveyance possible except country boats and these will cease to ply inside of ten days as there will not be enough water in the canals.
('93', 82, 1, 13, 169507) I am not fit enough to walk three or four miles even.
('93', 82, 1, 14, 169561) I like this isolation but you can imagine what it must be for poor people who live in dread.
('93', 82, 1, 15, 169654) I am glad that the spirit moved me to this place.

('93', 84, 7, 18, 172532) DEAR MADAM,
('93', 84, 8, 19, 172544) I have your letter of 11th ultimo.
('93', 84, 9, 20, 172579) I am afraid I must not encourage you to visit India for the purpose of studying Buddhist or Hindu teachings which you can pick up from books.
('93', 84, 9, 21, 172721) If it is Hindu life you wish to study, I must warn you against coming to India for that purpose because you hardly realize the reality unless you are able to probe deep enough.
('93', 84, 9, 22, 172898) And for doing humanitarian work you certainly do not need to tour any part of the world to learn the art of doing it.
('93', 84, 9, 23, 173016) It is the art of humanity which is needed and that you will find in all countries and under all climes.
('93', 84, 9, 24, 173120) As I have lived in South Africa for twenty years I know that there is
('93', 84, 10, 25, 173190) 1 In which the addressee had sought Gandhijis permission to visit India to study Buddhist and Hindu teachings so that she could do practical humanitatian work amongst her fellowmen.

('93', 85, 6, 11, 173791) DEAR FRIEND, I got your touching letter 1 yesterday.
('93', 85, 6, 12, 173844) I had heard that you had aged considerably and that you were passing through physical suffering.
('93', 85, 6, 13, 173941) I hope it was an exaggerated statement and that this will find you in enjoyment of health.
('93', 85, 6, 14, 174032) I understand and appreciate your remarks about Dr. Ambedkar 2. I suppose you are aware that I know him very well and that I have met him often enough.
('93', 85, 6, 15, 174183) He represents a good cause but he is a bad advocate for the simple reason that his passion has made him bitter and made him depart from the straight and narrow path.
('93', 85, 6, 16, 174349) As I know to my cost, he is a believer in questionable means so long as the end is considered to be good.
('93', 85, 6, 17, 174455) With him and with men like him the end justifies the means.
('93', 85, 6, 18, 174515) Have you read his book?
('93', 85, 6, 19, 174539) It is packed with untruths almost from beginning to end.
('93', 85, 6, 20, 174596) I am sorry to have to say this of a countryman who has himself been obliged to put up with insults which have embittered men mightier than Dr. Ambedkar.
('93', 85, 6, 21, 174749) You need not take all I say as gospel truth.
('93', 85, 6, 22, 174794) I have written this to you in order to
('93', 85, 7, 23, 174833) 1 The addressee in his letter of November 14, had referred to the bitter attitude of B. R. Ambedkar largely directed against yourself and asked Gandhiji to secure political justice for the untouchables.
('93', 85, 7, 24, 175036) He had further asked him to invite Ambedkar to see him.
('93', 85, 7, 25, 175092) 2 B. R. Ambedkar (1891 1956); leader of the Depressed Classes, jurist and author; in 1942 formed the Scheduled Castes Federation; member, Constituent Assembly; Chairman, Drafting Committee for the Constitution of India.

('93', 86, 1, 3, 175373) 1 that if I do not go out of my way to seek contact with Dr. Ambedkar it is not for want of will or want of regard for you and friends like you but because I know that such seeking will, in my view, harm the cause [rather] than help it.
('93', 86, 1, 4, 175610) No question of prestige will deter me from walking to him.
('93', 86, 1, 5, 175669) I can say that the question of prestige has never interfered with my doing what I believed was a duty.
('93', 86, 1, 6, 175772) I have laboured to show that in this case duty points the other way.

('93', 86, 5, 17, 176272) That is why I consider you silly.
('93', 86, 5, 18, 176306) Jaisukhlal has called you a slovenly girl.
('93', 86, 5, 19, 176349) You have received education but learnt no wisdom.
('93', 86, 5, 20, 176399) I do not, however, wish to point out your faults.
('93', 86, 5, 21, 176449) I will do so and pull your ears when you come here.
('93', 86, 5, 22, 176501) You will yourself admit that you have made those mistakes.
('93', 86, 5, 23, 176560) You need not come just to meet me.
('93', 86, 5, 24, 176595) Come only if you wish to take up some work here.
('93', 86, 5, 25, 176644) Otherwise you had better stay with Jaisukhlal at present.
('93', 86, 5, 26, 176702) You will know in a few months what happens to me.
('93', 86, 5, 27, 176752) The job here is a difficult one.

('93', 86, 5, 29, 176847) I understand about Umiya.
('93', 86, 5, 30, 176873) So long as we are satisfied with Shankarlal, we need not pay much attention to what sort of people the other family members are.
('93', 86, 5, 31, 177002) It is Umiyas job to reform the in laws.
('93', 86, 5, 32, 177042) She must regard Birla Sheth as filling the place of Jaisukhlal now.
('93', 86, 5, 33, 177110) The problem about Pratap 2 also will be solved.
('93', 86, 5, 34, 177158) In your ignorance you are thinking too much about this matter.
('93', 86, 5, 35, 177221) As long as Umiya is happy with Shankarlal, there is no cause at all for worry.
('93', 86, 5, 36, 177300) Ask Shankarlal to write to me and explain frankly what the problem is.
('93', 86, 5, 37, 177371) It is a mistake to

('93', 87, 1, 2, 177472) suppose that he cannot write to me because I am a big man.
('93', 87, 1, 3, 177531) I dont regard myself as one, and in any case of what value is my supposed greatness in relation to you, the children?
('93', 87, 1, 4, 177649) Since Shankarlal has married Umiya, he also is like a son to me.
('93', 87, 1, 5, 177714) Be calm now and do what you believe to be your dharma.
('93', 87, 1, 6, 177769) If you wish you may come to stay with me.

('93', 87, 10, 25, 178613) It would be a good thing if all the provinces followed an identical policy but probably it will not be possible.
('93', 87, 10, 26, 178726) Prakasam had mentioned absolutely nothing about the difficulty.

('93', 89, 7, 19, 180770) I myself do not believe that one can defend oneself by carrying weapons.
('93', 89, 7, 20, 180843) People can defend themselves only if they have courage.
('93', 89, 7, 21, 180899) Otherwise they will have to have Government protection or employ private body guards.
('93', 89, 7, 22, 180985) I think we can only exp ress our opinion in the matter.
('93', 89, 7, 23, 181041) We shall have to leave it to others to act for themselves.

('93', 90, 2, 3, 181446) SRIRAMPUR, [December 2, 1946] 2
('93', 90, 3, 4, 181478) The question of the exchange of population is unthinkable and impracticable.
('93', 90, 3, 5, 181555) This question never crossed my mind.
('93', 90, 3, 6, 181592) In every province, everyone is an Indian, be he a Hindu, a Muslim or of any other faith.
('93', 90, 3, 7, 181681) It would not be otherwise even if Pakistan came in full.
('93', 90, 3, 8, 181738) For me any such thing will spell bankruptcy of Indian wisdom or statesmanship or both.
('93', 90, 3, 9, 181825) The logical consequence of any such step is too dreadful to contemplate.
('93', 90, 3, 10, 181898) Is it not that India should be artificially divided into so many religious zones?
('93', 90, 4, 11, 181980) When asked if, in view of the unsettled situation, it was not better to adopt a migration policy, Gandhiji said : I see nothing to warrant such a policy.
('93', 90, 4, 12, 182134) It is one of despair and, therefore, to be adopted in rare cases as a last resort.
('93', 90, 5, 13, 182217) QUESTION: You said the other day that there was no limit to your stay in East Bengal.
('93', 90, 5, 14, 182303) Do you think that by confining yourself to Srirampur you will be able to send your message of peace to other villages of Noakhali?
('93', 90, 5, 15, 182434) GANDHIJI: Of course, I am not burying myself long in Sriram pur.
('93', 90, 5, 16, 182499) I am not idle here.
('93', 90, 5, 17, 182519) I am seeing people of the surrounding villages and others.
('93', 90, 5, 18, 182578) I am studying things and regaining lost physical strength meanwhile.
('93', 90, 5, 19, 182647) The idea ultimately is to go on foot, when possible and necessary, from village to village and induce the evacuees to return.
('93', 90, 5, 20, 182773) This I can only do with effect when I have seen things myself.
('93', 90, 5, 21, 182836) It is quite clear to me that my mere word carries very little weight.
('93', 90, 5, 22, 182906) Distrust has gone too deep for exhortation.
('93', 90, 6, 23, 182950) Gandhiji was next asked regarding the report that he found himself in darkness, and why and when the darkness came over him and whether he saw any release from it.
('93', 90, 6, 24, 183114) Gandhiji said : I am afraid the report is substantial.
('93', 90, 6, 25, 183169) Outside circumstances have never overwhelmed me.The reason for the present daness lies within me.
('93', 90, 6, 26, 183267) I find that my ahimsa does not seem to answer in the matter of Hindu Muslim relations.
('93', 90, 6, 27, 183354) This struck me forcibly when I came to learn of the events in Noakhali.
('93', 90, 7, 28, 183426) 1 Extracted from Srirampur Diary 2Hindustan Standard, 4 12 1946, reported the interview under the dateline Srirampur, December 2.
('93', 91, 0, 1, 183556) 92 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('93', 91, 1, 2, 183597) The reported forcible conversions and the distress of the Bengali sisters touched me deeply.
('93', 91, 1, 3, 183690) I could do nothing through pen or speech.
('93', 91, 1, 4, 183732) I argued to myself that I must be on the scene of action and test the soundness of the doctrine which has sustained me and made life worth living.
('93', 91, 1, 5, 183879) Was it the weapon of the weak as it was often held by my critics or was it truly the weapon of the strong?
('93', 91, 1, 6, 183986) The question arose in me when I had no ready made solution for the distemper of which Noakhali was such a glaring symptom.
('93', 91, 1, 7, 184109) And so setting aside all my activities, I hastened to Noakhali to find out where I stood.
('93', 91, 1, 8, 184199) I know positively that ahimsa is a perfect instrument.
('93', 91, 1, 9, 184254) If it did not answer in my hands, the imperfection was in me.
('93', 91, 1, 10, 184316) My technique was at fault.
('93', 91, 1, 11, 184343) I could not discover the error from a distance.
('93', 91, 1, 12, 184391) Hence I came here trying to make the discovery.
('93', 91, 1, 13, 184439) I must, therefore, own myself in darkness till I see light.
('93', 91, 1, 14, 184499) God only knows when it will come.
('93', 91, 1, 15, 184533) More I cannot say.

('93', 91, 3, 18, 184603) SRIRAMPUR, December 2, 1946
('93', 91, 4, 19, 184631) Speaking after prayer, Gandhiji chose as his theme the story referred to in the bhajan which had just been sung.
('93', 91, 4, 20, 184744) The chief of the elephants had gone for a drink to the river when he was caught hold of by an alligator.
('93', 91, 4, 21, 184849) A furious struggle ensued, but in spite of his strength, the elephant was dragged into deeper waters.
('93', 91, 4, 22, 184951) When he was on the point of being drowned, the elephant realized that his huge strength was of no avail, and he prayed to God for succour.
('93', 91, 4, 23, 185090) God, the help of the helpless, came to his rescue and saved him from the jaws of death.
('93', 91, 4, 24, 185178) The moral was obvious.
('93', 91, 4, 25, 185201) The strength of the strong without Gods help had been often found to be useless.
('93', 91, 4, 26, 185282) Therefore, he advised dependence not on outside sources but upon the inner strength which came to all who sincerely sought it from God.
('93', 91, 4, 27, 185418) This was the lesson which the people in Noakhali sorely needed to learn.

('93', 92, 1, 2, 185755) 125. NOTE ON THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY 1
('93', 92, 2, 3, 185795) SRIRAMPUR, NOAKHALI, December 3, 1946 I am quite clear that if there is a boycott by the Muslim League of the Constituent Assembly, 2it should not meet under the Cabinet Missions statement 3 of May 16. It clearly contemplates the co operation of the two major parties, viz., the Congress and the League.
('93', 92, 2, 4, 186099) Therefore, if one of them proclaims a boycott, the Consti tuent Assembly cannot with propriety meet under that Paper.
('93', 92, 2, 5, 186217) If the Government convene the Constituent Assembly in spite of the boycott, they can legitimately do so only under some other statement which they can draw up in consultation with the Congress.
('93', 92, 2, 6, 186411) It should never be forgotten that however powerful the Congress has become, Constituent Assembly as contemplated today can only meet by action of the British Government.
('93', 92, 2, 7, 186581) 2. Even if the Constituent Assembly meets in spite of the boycott, but with the willing co operation of the British Gover nment, it will be under the visible or invisible protection of the British forces, whether Indian or European.
('93', 92, 2, 8, 186814) In my opinion, 94 we shall never reach a satisfactory constitution under these circumstances.
('93', 92, 2, 9, 186908) Whether we own it or not, our weakness will be felt by the whole world.
('93', 92, 2, 10, 186980) 3. It may be said that not to meet as a Constituent Assembly under these circumstances will amount to a surrender to Qaid e Azam Jinnah or the Muslim League.
('93', 92, 2, 11, 187138) I do not mind the charge because the waiver will not be an act of weakness, it will be one of Congress strength because it would be due to the logic of facts.
('93', 92, 2, 12, 187297) If we have attained a certain degree of status and strength to warrant us in
('93', 92, 3, 13, 187374) 1 In My Days with Gandhi, N. K. Bose explains that Gandhiji dictated this in the afternoon for the Working Committee.
('93', 92, 3, 14, 187492) 2 The Muslim League had refused to attend the Constituent Assembly unless the Congress gave up its reservations on the question of grouping.
('93', 92, 3, 15, 187633) The British Government, in an attempt to bring about a compromise, invited the leaders of the two parties to London for negotiations from December 3 to 6. No headway was made.

('93', 93, 1, 2, 188019) convening our own Constituent Assembly irrespective of the British Government, it will be a proper thing.
('93', 93, 1, 3, 188125) We will have then to seek the co operation of the Muslim League and all the parties including the Princes, and the Constituent Assembly can meet at a favourable place even if some do not join.
('93', 93, 1, 4, 188318) Thus it may be only the Congress Provinces plus Princes who may care to join.
('93', 93, 1, 5, 188396) I think this would be dignified and wholly consistent with facts.

('93', 93, 3, 9, 188799) 1. Somehow or other the Committees that were being formed do not appear to be functioning properly.
('93', 93, 3, 10, 188899) As yet, they have failed to inspire confidence.
('93', 93, 3, 11, 188947) 2. In spite of all my efforts exodus continues and very few persons have returned to their villages.
('93', 93, 3, 12, 189048) They say the guilty parties are still at large, some finding a place on the Peace Committees, that sporadic cases of murder and arson still continue, that abducted women have not all been returned, that forcibly converted persons have not all returned, that burnt houses are not being rebuilt and generally the atmosphere of goodwill is lacking.
('93', 93, 3, 13, 189394) How far these charges are true or can be proved I do not know.
('93', 93, 3, 14, 189457) My object just now is to bring these to your notice.
('93', 93, 3, 15, 189510) It might be that a summary impartial inquiry is necessary to restore confidence.
('93', 93, 3, 16, 189591) 3. Restrictions are being placed on volunteers irrespective of the organizations to which they belong.
('93', 93, 3, 17, 189694) I can understand illegal activities being restricted, but no other restriction would be advisable.
('93', 93, 3, 18, 189793) 4. Adequate food and warm clothing and fit habitation is surely necessary while there are bona fide refugees.
('93', 93, 3, 19, 189903) To deny these amenities would create suspicion and defeat the purpose of sending them back to their villages.
('93', 93, 3, 20, 190013) I am of opinion that if the Government are unable to provide adequate food and clothing, facility should be readily given to benevolent persons to supply them.

('93', 94, 7, 12, 190616) There is no post office here.
('93', 94, 7, 13, 190646) How, then, can there be any facility for telegrams?
('93', 94, 7, 14, 190698) I am stuck here.
('93', 94, 7, 15, 190715) I may never leave the place.
('93', 94, 7, 16, 190744) I can leave only when things become perfectly normal again.
('93', 94, 7, 17, 190804) If they do not, I would prefer to die here.
('93', 94, 7, 18, 190848) You may assume that just now I have forgotten all about Sevagram, Uruli Kanchan, and so on.
('93', 94, 7, 19, 190940) I am alone here, but it is not likely that I shall be left so.
('93', 94, 7, 20, 191003) I do not seem to be destined for such a test.
('93', 94, 7, 21, 191049) I will inform you when the dhotis 3 are received.
('93', 94, 7, 22, 191099) I will start wearing them immediately.
('93', 94, 7, 23, 191138) My ahimsa is going to be severly put to the test here.

('93', 94, 7, 26, 191326) I suppose you know that it was her birthday.
('93', 94, 7, 27, 191371) She is deeply engrossed in her work.
('93', 94, 7, 28, 191408) How can you leave your work?
('93', 94, 7, 29, 191437) You can easily be assigned one village.
('93', 94, 7, 30, 191477) You are perfectly fit for the work, but I should not like to ask you to leave your work there.
('93', 94, 7, 31, 191572) If you can come without any dislocation of your work you may do so.

('93', 94, 8, 33, 191689) The Last Phase, however, says that one of them gave details of an incident in which a Muslim mob of 250 had attacked a Hindu village, and the other referred to the economic boycott of Hindus by Muslims in the Chandpur sub division.

('93', 95, 7, 15, 192718) SRIRAMPUR, December 3, 1946
('93', 95, 8, 16, 192746) By way of introduction Gandhiji said that he felt very happy that Prof.
('93', 95, 8, 17, 192818) Nelson 3
('93', 95, 9, 18, 192827) had thus shared in the prayer.
('93', 95, 9, 19, 192858) While in detention at the Aga Khan Palace, Mirabehn used to sing this hymn to him in her rich, sonorous voice.
('93', 95, 9, 20, 192969) He then paraphrased the meaning of the first three verses and said that the sentiment expressed in it was the same as found in the Gajendra Moksha bhajan sung last evening.
('93', 95, 9, 21, 193142) There was the same reliance upon God, who was the source of all strength when every other earthly aid failed us.
('93', 95, 9, 22, 193255) All human power was transient and real safety could lie only when we placed our reliance wholly on God.
('93', 95, 9, 23, 193359) Beneath the shadow of Thy throne Thy saints have dwelt serene;
('93', 95, 10, 24, 193422) Sufficient is Thine arm alone
('93', 95, 11, 25, 193452) And our defence is sure.
('93', 95, 12, 26, 193477) This was a lesson which all of us in Noakhali sorely needed to learn.

('93', 96, 2, 3, 194005) SRIRAMPUR, NOAKHALI DISTRICT, December 4, 1946
('93', 96, 3, 4, 194052) MIRA, Your letter dated November 18 reached me only yesterday.
('93', 96, 3, 5, 194115) You know I am in a more inaccessible place than you are in.
('93', 96, 3, 6, 194175) 1 The distance is not too great but there is no cart road even.
('93', 96, 3, 7, 194239) When the overflow canal water dries up, as it will in about ten days, all but walking to and fro will be out of place.
('93', 96, 3, 8, 194358) The post is taken by runners as it was in Kathiawar only a few years ago and is in some places even now.
('93', 96, 3, 9, 194463) Dont worry about me.
('93', 96, 3, 10, 194484) Put your faith and trust in God.
('93', 96, 3, 11, 194517) I am in His safe keeping.
('93', 96, 3, 12, 194543) He will make or mar me.
('93', 96, 3, 13, 194567) For Him it will be all making, never marring.
('93', 96, 3, 14, 194613) Newspapers do not come here regularly.
('93', 96, 3, 15, 194652) When they come, they come behind time and what does come is local newspapers.
('93', 96, 3, 16, 194730) Therefore, one does not know what appears in the Press.
('93', 96, 3, 17, 194786) My pres cription iDont believe what appears in the Press, and remember that no news is good news.
('93', 96, 3, 18, 194884) Do you know that A. J. Balfour 2 when he was Prime Minister used to boast that he never read newspapers and lost nothing.
('93', 96, 3, 19, 195006) Then I suppose you know that all my companions are distributed in different villages.
('93', 96, 3, 20, 195092) Pyarelal sees me often but he is not with me.
('93', 96, 3, 21, 195138) He is in a village by himself assisted by a Bengali interpreter.
('93', 96, 3, 22, 195203) I have Parasuram with me and therefore am able to dictate.
('93', 96, 3, 23, 195262) The original idea was that I should take and want no assistance except a Bengali interpreter.
('93', 96, 3, 24, 195356) Parasuram always helped Pyarelal but here he could not be placed by himself in a village.
('93', 96, 3, 25, 195446) He was naturally anxious to be with me directly but he could not when I had all other assistance and was doing another class of work.
('93', 96, 3, 26, 195580) Now that he is here, in addition to looking after me personally, he does my shorthand

('93', 97, 1, 3, 196148) And the Bengali assistant is a Professor who has for years made a deep study of my writings.
('93', 97, 1, 4, 196241) Therefore, I have got most desirable assistance, but that assistance cannot cope with newspapers.
('93', 97, 1, 5, 196339) Hence my outside work has been reduced to a minimum.
('93', 97, 1, 6, 196392) The work here is new, very pleasant, equally taxing.
('93', 97, 1, 7, 196445) My ahimsa is on its trial.
('93', 97, 1, 8, 196472) More of this another time.
('93', 97, 1, 9, 196499) This is only to relieve you of all anxiety on my behalf.
('93', 97, 1, 10, 196556) I am now taking or trying to take the usual diet but it may take some time after the twenty one days denial to get used to it.
('93', 97, 1, 11, 196683) I am progressing towards normal strength as quickly as I can.
('93', 97, 1, 12, 196745) I dare not be in a hurry.
('93', 97, 1, 13, 196771) Now I see you resumed the thread you left on November 18, on 22. Your problems are extraordinary but they are all of your own making.Therefore you can, as you must, reduce them to a manageable degree.
('93', 97, 1, 14, 196972) You will not find the men or the man by searching.
('93', 97, 1, 15, 197023) He or they will come to you if God wants you to do the type of work for which you want the man.
('93', 97, 1, 16, 197119) I will, therefore say, wait on Him and do what you can with out vexing the soul.
('93', 97, 1, 17, 197200) Krishnachandra, I think, will not come.
('93', 97, 1, 18, 197240) He is now content to be under Vinoba and gives him full satisfaction and, so far as I know, is himself satisfied.
('93', 97, 1, 19, 197354) He has not written to me for over a month.
('93', 97, 1, 20, 197397) I know no other person whom I can send to you, nor do I think will Ghanshyamdasji be able to give you any guidance.
('93', 97, 1, 21, 197513) He can only give you money but that is not what you need or should need.
('93', 97, 1, 22, 197586) The Ashram is purely your own original idea.
('93', 97, 1, 23, 197631) If the present site is not suitable for you, you should make what use you can of it.
('93', 97, 1, 24, 197716) Personally, I would say, give up the idea of Ashram life except for your own person.
('93', 97, 1, 25, 197801) Then you wont feel cramped and you can expand as high or as broad as the universe.
('93', 97, 1, 26, 197884) You know that as ashram I disbanded Sabarmati and it became a Harijan institution.
('93', 97, 1, 27, 197967) The original was Satyagraha Ashram.
('93', 97, 1, 28, 198003) That is gone for ever.
('93', 97, 1, 29, 198026) Do not therefore ever think of handing over to anybody else the Ashram of your conception.
('93', 97, 1, 30, 198117) Have in the present place married men or bachelors or whoever serves efficiently the activities you may take up.
('93', 97, 1, 31, 198230) Othe rwise, you will break down in health in spite of the most ideal weather you can have.
('93', 97, 1, 32, 198321) Remember that in all I have said in the foregoing I have made the fullest allowance for your conception of the Ashram and because I have done so I have advised you to restrict the Ashram

('93', 98, 7, 15, 199215) DEAR FRIEND, Sardar Bahadur Sir Datar Singh of the Department of Agriculture, Government of India, New Delhi, writes to me to say that difficulty is being experienced in their land being restored to the Calcutta Pinjrapole Society.
('93', 98, 7, 16, 199447) This was seized for military purposes evidently during the war period.
('93', 98, 7, 17, 199518) The reason given for the refusal is that the Provincial Government have under consideration a scheme for the development of the Kanchrapara area.
('93', 98, 7, 18, 199664) I fancy that the decision about the development scheme must necessarily take a longtime to make.
('93', 98, 7, 19, 199761) When and if it is made there should be no diffi culty in the Government appropriating the restored land.
('93', 98, 7, 20, 199866) Meanwhile, it could be utilised for a benevolent purpose, namely, increase in the
('93', 98, 8, 21, 199948) 1 Mirabehn explains: This letter led me definitely to the decision to give up the idea of trying to keep Kisan Ashram as a Brahmachari Ashram and to put married men with their families there.
('93', 98, 8, 22, 200140) Bapus advice that I should restrict the Ashram of my conception to myself, I whole heartedly accepted and as I was at that time planning a Government scheme for cattle development in the reserve forests near Rishikesh, I decided to settle in a little cottage on Gangajis bank in the middle of the grazing lands and make that my Ashram. 2 The subscription is in Hindi.

('93', 99, 5, 12, 201220) The reason for my not reading your letter there and then was that he was in the company of several friends and I was about to go to the prayer meeting 2 in which he took keen interest and wanted to read from a Pelican book in his possession, Our God, our help in ages past which I readily let him do, and at the close of the prayer the few words that I said to the audience consisted of a free rendering of the hymn he read but could not or would not sing.
('93', 99, 5, 13, 201677) I have invited him to drop in again when he wished to which he said he would do in a few days time.

('93', 101, 7, 18, 203921) [December 4, 1946] 2
('93', 101, 8, 19, 203942) At meal time Prof.
('93', 101, 8, 20, 203961) Amiya Chakravarty of the Calcutta University, who had come to him on a visit, asked him the question as to what should be the technique for approaching the wrongdoers so that their resistance should be dissolved.
('93', 101, 8, 21, 204174) The chief difficulty with the callous perpetrators of crimes is, Dr. Chakravarty remarked, that they are not only unrepentant but defiant and even jubilant over their misdeeds. Gandhiji replied : Yes, they have their own reason to be jubilant and the only way to meet their attitude is not to succumb to it but to live in their midst and retain ones sense of truth.
('93', 101, 8, 22, 204540) Goodness must be joined with knowledge.
('93', 101, 8, 23, 204580) Mere goodness is not of much use as I have found in life.
('93', 101, 8, 24, 204638) One must cultivate the fine, discriminating quality which goes with spiritual courage and character.
('93', 101, 8, 25, 204739) One must know, in a crucial situation, when to speak and when to be silent, when to act and

('93', 102, 1, 2, 204963) when to refrain.
('93', 102, 1, 3, 204980) Action and non action in these circumstances become identical instead of being contradictory.
('93', 102, 1, 4, 205074) I am groping for light.
('93', 102, 1, 5, 205098) I am surrounded by darkness; but I must act or refrain as guided by truth.
('93', 102, 1, 6, 205173) I find that I have not the patience and the technique needed in these tragic circumstances; suffering and evil often overwhelms me and I stew in my own juice.
('93', 102, 1, 7, 205332) Therefore, I have told my friends that they should bear with me and work or refrain as guided by wisdom which is now utterly demanded of us.
('93', 102, 1, 8, 205473) This darkness will break and, if I see light even those who created the tragedy of the recent communalism in Bengal, will.
('93', 102, 2, 9, 205596) The new basis has to be built here in the villages where the Hindus and the Muslims have lived and suffered together in the land of their forefathers and must live together in the future.
('93', 102, 2, 10, 205784) For the time being I have become a Bengali and a Noakhali man.
('93', 102, 2, 11, 205847) I have come to live and share their task, to cement the two together or to perish in the attempt.
('93', 102, 2, 12, 205945) I am in the midst of a raging fire and will stay here till it is put out.
('93', 102, 2, 13, 206019) For this reason, I do not want to leave these parts.
('93', 102, 2, 14, 206072) Life must be made livable for the sorely afflicted men and women.
('93', 102, 2, 15, 206138) The work of organization must go on and the physical as well as moral rescue achieved.
('93', 102, 3, 16, 206225) Dr. Chakravarty next suggested that the reports from Gandhijis associates who are now working separately in the different villages should be collected and collated so that fellow workers could gain new light on the technique of the non violence of the strong that was being evolved and experimented within East Bengal.
('93', 102, 3, 17, 206544) Gandhiji replied : The time is not yet ripe for that.
('93', 102, 3, 18, 206598) 2 They have gone with my best wishes but to an atmosphere which is still unhelpful.
('93', 102, 3, 19, 206682) They are following not a beaten path but a trackless route.
('93', 102, 3, 20, 206742) Their work lies in the midst of a Muslim population.
('93', 102, 3, 21, 206795) They do not know the language and are not familiar with local problems.
('93', 102, 3, 22, 206867) I myself dont know what the next step is and cannot guide them.
('93', 102, 3, 23, 206931) They are unable to send reports now.
('93', 102, 3, 24, 206968) If I made a chart for them, they would be able to keep a log book.
('93', 102, 3, 25, 207035) Even the great Thakkar Bapa, as old as myself, a seasoned worker and utterly selfless, is working away without knowing what he is doinga thing he has never done before in his life.
('93', 102, 3, 26, 207216) But I am hopeful that order will come out of what is for us the necessary chaos.
('93', 102, 3, 27, 207297) Then what you wish, and I also, will be forthcoming and will be a most

('93', 103, 2, 3, 207578) A. C. That is what all our people feel and also workers abroad.
('93', 103, 2, 4, 207642) Noakhali has now become a laboratory where a crucial test is being made; the remedy will apply to situations all the world over where disputes arise between communities and nationalities and a new technique is needed for peaceful adjustment.
('93', 103, 3, 5, 207884) G. From London too I have heard to the same effect.
('93', 103, 3, 6, 207936) People are interested in what happens in Noakhali.
('93', 103, 3, 7, 207987) I feel that my responsibility is great and that our work has to ring true.
('93', 103, 4, 8, 208062) A. C. That Bengal should be chosen for this great task, that you should have made this your centre, is, to us, a supreme privilege though people have suffered and are suffering beyond description.
('93', 103, 4, 9, 208259) The whole of Bengal is conscious of your arrival and of the fact that you have come to live and work with the suffering men and women who need you so much at this hour.
('93', 103, 5, 10, 208428) G. For me, if this thing is pulled through, it will be the crowning act of my life.
('93', 103, 5, 11, 208512) I had to come down to the soil and to the people of East Bengal.
('93', 103, 5, 12, 208577) The first person to whom I mentioned this was Jawaharlal.
('93', 103, 5, 13, 208635) Without a moments hesitation he replied: Yes, your place is there.
('93', 103, 5, 14, 208702) Although we need you so much here, we need you more in Noakhali. I asked him, When? As soon as you feel like it, he replied.
('93', 103, 5, 15, 208827) In two days I started.

('93', 103, 9, 19, 208978) As Gandhiji began his daily discourse, he gave unstinted praise to the musicians.
('93', 103, 9, 20, 209060) 2 Indeed, he said, he had never heard the Bengal mridanga (drum) played so well as was done at the meeting.
('93', 103, 9, 21, 209168) When played well it had a sweetness all its own.
('93', 103, 9, 22, 209217) He had also appreciated the namasankirtan; but he hoped that it did not come merely from the throat but from their heart.
('93', 103, 9, 23, 209339) For, a parrot also can repeat what it learns from its master.
('93', 103, 9, 24, 209401) There is hardly any virtue when we take the name of God when we live in safety.
('93', 103, 9, 25, 209481) It becomes real only when taken in danger.
('93', 103, 10, 26, 209524) He would never mind if a Hindu recited the kalma willingly and with a full
('93', 103, 11, 27, 209599) 1 Extracted from Srirampur Diary 2 The report said: Shortly before prayer, a group of people from the neighbouring villages arrived, singing the namasankirtan to the accompaniment of the khol (drum) and the karatala (cymbals).
('93', 103, 11, 28, 209826) When the Ramdhun was being sung, they kept time by means of the khol.

('93', 104, 1, 2, 209944) But if he did so out of fear of losing his life or possessions, then he took the name of God in vain, for it was the voice of Satan which then spoke through him.
('93', 104, 1, 3, 210106) As he understood Islam, it had never prospered nor could prosper by means of force.
('93', 104, 1, 4, 210190) Any man who pretended to serve Islam in that manner only did a disservice to the noble religion.
('93', 104, 2, 5, 210287) Every religion today had become tainted by unwanted accretions.
('93', 104, 2, 6, 210351) In Hinduism we treated a large part of our brethren as untouchables, and Gandhiji said he had no doubt that we were paying sorrowfully for that sin.
('93', 104, 3, 7, 210500) The first verse of the Ishopanishad contained the essence of Hindu spiritual experience.
('93', 104, 3, 8, 210589) The purport of the verse was that all that existed in the universe was pervaded by and had its being in God.
('93', 104, 3, 9, 210698) Therefore, no man could claim anything as his own.
('93', 104, 3, 10, 210749) He should dedicate his body, mind and all that he possessed to that Universal Being and use only what he received through His grace.
('93', 104, 3, 11, 210882) The moral of it was that we should deprive no man of his wealth, whether it be in the shape of life, honour or religion.
('93', 104, 3, 12, 211003) A believer in this truth, living up to it, shed all fear and lived in perfect peace.
('93', 104, 4, 13, 211088) The verses 1 of the Bhagavad Gita were then referred to as they formed the next item in the Ashrams evening prayer.
('93', 104, 4, 14, 211204) They described the characteristics of one who had attained knowledge and brought his senses under full control.
('93', 104, 4, 15, 211316) The lesson of the Bhagavad Gita was meant not for those who had forsaken the world, but for every householder, irrespective of his birth and state.
('93', 104, 4, 16, 211464) Everybodys duty should be to attain the state described therein and this could only be done if life was built on the rock of fearlessness.

('93', 104, 7, 21, 211692) 4 I see I have not the knack.
('93', 104, 7, 22, 211722) I have not yet quite found the key to ahimsa.

('93', 105, 2, 3, 212423) AS FROM SEVAGRAM, VIA WARDHA, INDIA, CAMP: SRIRAMPUR, EAST BENGAL, December 5, 1946
('93', 105, 3, 4, 212507) DEAR HANNAH 1, I have your letter full of pathos and also full of news which I would not have got otherwise.
('93', 105, 3, 5, 212616) I like your frankness.
('93', 105, 3, 6, 212639) Who does not like life?
('93', 105, 3, 7, 212663) Therefore, it is no fault in you that you should like life and that you should have also likes and dislikes.
('93', 105, 3, 8, 212772) But though these are common to mankind we have got to overcome them if life is to become rich in reality, and the memory of departed dear ones is to become a treasure.
('93', 105, 3, 9, 212940) It can only be to the extent that it enables us to translate in our own lives the best parts of dear ones and Hermann undoubtedly had many such parts which we may copy with advantage.
('93', 105, 3, 10, 213124) You should therefore try to do so.
('93', 105, 3, 11, 213159) I am glad you went to Phoenix to help Manilal when he was so much in need of your help.
('93', 105, 3, 12, 213247) I am glad Isele has qualified as a doctor and that she has got a permanent job as house physician in the General Hospital.
('93', 105, 3, 13, 213370) Are you otherwise at peace with yourself?
('93', 105, 3, 14, 213412) Manilal will tell you that I am at present engaged in tackling the most difficult piece of work in my life and I am staying in a most inaccessible part of India at the present moment.
('93', 105, 3, 15, 213596) Do not hesitate to write to me whenever the spirit moves you.
('93', 105, 3, 16, 213658) It is easy enough for me to promise not to write in reply every time I hear from you.
('93', 105, 3, 17, 213744) This time I feel like writing in order to encourage you to write to me regularly and also to tell you that you have in me your best friend who will try somewhat to do what Hermann used to do so fully.
('93', 105, 3, 18, 213945) You are bound to miss him as we all do.
('93', 105, 3, 19, 213985) He certainly expected to come back to me had he lived.

('93', 106, 2, 3, 214359) SRIRAMPUR, NOAKHALI DISTT., December 5, 1946
('93', 106, 3, 4, 214404) DEAR PRAKASAM, I have your letter with enclosures.
('93', 106, 3, 5, 214455) I have studied all the papers you have sent to me.
('93', 106, 3, 6, 214506) Your statement appears to me to be in order so far as it goes.
('93', 106, 3, 7, 214569) But I do feel that if the new policy 1 becomes popular with the masses, the concentrated production of cotton will become decentralised and distributed like khadi cloth itself and to that extent the Presidency will be the gainer, as the whole of India will, if it takes up the Madras policy, as it will, if Madras succeeds, as it ought to if the villagers take up khadi with zest.
('93', 106, 3, 8, 214950) They will, if khadi becomes cheaper than unprotected mill cloth, as Shri Manu Subedar has shown from the figures, which I have printed in Harijan.
('93', 106, 3, 9, 215097) The argument in the cuttings you have been good enough to send me makes no appeal to me and if I get time from the heavy Noakhali work before me I shall write in Harijan.
('93', 106, 3, 10, 215268) But I know nothing about the legal argument which, of course, you will get properly examined by the Advocate General and other lawyers expert in the matter and, if the legal argument is against you, naturally you will resile from the position taken up by you.But I take it that you had the legal position carefully examined before you took the plunge.
('93', 106, 3, 11, 215620) But apart from the question of establishing new mills or expan ding the old ones, how is the scheme progressing?
('93', 106, 3, 12, 215733) Have you already made the commencement?
('93', 106, 3, 13, 215773) How are the people concerned taking it?
('93', 106, 3, 14, 215813) Is the legislature overwhelmingly with you?
('93', 106, 3, 15, 215857) I am in such an inaccessible place that I get very few newspapers and they are local ones.
('93', 106, 3, 16, 215948) I, therefore, know very little of what is going on outside Noakhali.
('93', 106, 3, 17, 216017) Therefore Noakhali at present is my world and it is large enough for me.
('93', 106, 3, 18, 216090) Please keep me informed of what is going on about the scheme and do not hesitate to make concrete suggestions if you expect me to do anything concrete.

('93', 107, 2, 3, 216464) SRIRAMPUR, December 5, 1946 A special messenger from the District Magistrate, Comilla, delivered your packet containing your two letters dated 2nd and 3rd instant respectively.
('93', 107, 2, 4, 216641) I am glad that you are going to issue some such statement as suggested by me.
('93', 107, 2, 5, 216719) In these days of fear, sometimes not without ground and sometimes groundless, no contradiction should be superfluous, much less appear foolish.
('93', 107, 2, 6, 216863) 2. If some mischievous Hindu young men have been throwing crackers and missiles at Muharrum processions, I would suggest that they should be brought to book.
('93', 107, 2, 7, 217021) 3. I note that you have devoted a considerable portion of your letter of the 2nd December and the whole of the 3rd December to Bihar, and you have repeated the advice you have given me often enough that my place is rather in Bihar than in Noakhali.
('93', 107, 2, 8, 217270) If I find any confirmation of the most serious statements made by you about Bihar, I confess that I have egregiously blundered by resuming normal diet.
('93', 107, 3, 9, 217422) But I am loath to reject the testimony of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, then of Dr. Rajendra Prasad, both responsible men and persons who had gone specially for the purpose of seeing things for themselves andallaying mob fury.
('93', 107, 3, 10, 217644) They admit that the behaviour of the Hindu crowds was bad enough in all conscience but they do not bear out the statements made in your letter.
('93', 107, 3, 11, 217788) Nor do they uphold the figure given by you.
('93', 107, 3, 12, 217832) They also tell me that mob fury has subsided and that the Government have regained control undoubtedly with the assistance of the military.
('93', 107, 3, 13, 217972) If I could feel that my presence was at all necessary in Bihar, I assure you that I would not need any encouragement from you to do so.
('93', 107, 3, 14, 218108) On the contrary, my informants assure me that my presence is not required in Bihar.
('93', 107, 3, 15, 218192) In these circumstances, unless I feel sure of my ground, I know that I must go to Bihar.
('93', 107, 3, 16, 218281) But I would like to make the assurance doubly sure and with that end in view I would be glad to get your permission to send copies of your letters to the Prime Minister of Bihar and know his reaction.
('93', 107, 3, 17, 218482) There too you will pardon me, will you not, for not taking your statements as gospel truth.
('93', 107, 3, 18, 218574) For one thing, you have no first hand knowledge of events.
('93', 107, 3, 19, 218633) I suggest that

('93', 108, 0, 1, 218689) VOL. 93: 7 NOVEMBER, 1946 16 FEBRUARY, 1947 109
('93', 108, 1, 2, 218737) there should be an impartial commission, appointed with the consent of the two Governments, to go into the disturbances both in Noakhali and Bihar.
('93', 108, 1, 3, 218885) 1 If your statements are true and the callous behaviour of the Bihar Government, which you so graphically describe, can be sustained, it is a bad day for the Bihar Government, a bad day for the Hindus and good bye to restoration of friendly relations between the two communities, and it would be a serious question for me to consider where I stand.
('93', 108, 1, 4, 219234) The least I can permit myself to say is that then I should have no hesitation in publicily denouncing the Bihar Ministers and Bihar Hindus.
('93', 108, 1, 5, 219374) I would plead with you to suspend, if you at all can, final judgment in the matter.
('93', 108, 1, 6, 219458) 4. Now I come to Noakhali.
('93', 108, 1, 7, 219485) I sent you a longish letter yesterday and I asked Satis Babu to arrange for its quickest delivery through a special messenger.
('93', 108, 1, 8, 219612) I tried even to see if there was possibility of sending it by air but I failed.
('93', 108, 1, 9, 219692) You have painted a rosy picture of things in Noakhali.
('93', 108, 1, 10, 219747) I wish I could share your estimate.
('93', 108, 1, 11, 219783) I have formed no judgment.
('93', 108, 1, 12, 219810) I have passed on to you the purport of much of what is handed to me in writing and what is given to me by word of mouth.
('93', 108, 1, 13, 219931) If the information imparted to me is correct, things are not safe enough in Noakhali.
('93', 108, 1, 14, 220017) Hindus have not shed their fear and from what you say even the Muslims are not free from it.
('93', 108, 1, 15, 220110) My business in coming here is not to sow or promote dissensions between the two.
('93', 108, 1, 16, 220191) I regard myself, as I have ever been, an equal friend of both.
('93', 108, 1, 17, 220254) I know that through no fault of which I am conscious I have lost caste in the Muslim League circles.
('93', 108, 1, 18, 220355) No Muslim friend has yet been able to tell me what I have done to deserve that fate.
('93', 108, 1, 19, 220440) I am in Noakhali to be judged by my conduct.
('93', 108, 1, 20, 220485) My non violence is at stake.
('93', 108, 1, 21, 220514) Bear with me whilst I am groping.
('93', 108, 1, 22, 220548) I am the same person as I was when we met in Faridpur and later in Deshbandhus house after his death.
('93', 108, 1, 23, 220650) This much is enough for time being.
('93', 108, 1, 24, 220686) Yours sincerely, M. K. GANDHI [PS.] Wish you could show me a quicker way of reaching my letters to you, as they are likely to be important and probably frequent.

('93', 109, 2, 3, 221122) AS FROM KHADI PRATISHTHAN, SODEPUR, CAMP: SRIRAMPUR, December 5, 1946
('93', 109, 3, 4, 221192) DEAR AGATHA, Ramakrishna Bajaj has sent me your welcome letter.
('93', 109, 3, 5, 221256) Carl Heath did write to me and I wrote to him at once.
('93', 109, 3, 6, 221311) I have no doubt he will share that letter with you.
('93', 109, 3, 7, 221363) I, therefore, say no more about the subject matter of the letter, important though it is.
('93', 109, 3, 8, 221453) Here I am in an inaccessible part of Bengal and dealing with the most difficult part of my mission in life.
('93', 109, 3, 9, 221561) I have never been in such darkness as I am in today.
('93', 109, 3, 10, 221614) And the darkness does not come from outside.
('93', 109, 3, 11, 221659) It is due to my limitations.
('93', 109, 3, 12, 221688) My faith in ahimsa has never burned brighter and yet I feel that there is something wanting in my technique of it that I feel as though I were on an unbeaten track.
('93', 109, 3, 13, 221853) As you must have known, my fast has blown over just now.
('93', 109, 3, 14, 221910) Bihar is quiet and I am therefore trying to take the usual diet though I have still to be cautious.
('93', 109, 3, 15, 222010) I hope soon to get over the physical weakness which was inevitable with no protein and no starch and no fat diet.
('93', 109, 3, 16, 222124) The most satisfactory thing about this reduced diet was that I was able to do full amount of mental work and a fair amount even of physical work.
('93', 109, 3, 17, 222270) If this letter reaches while Amrit is still in Europe, please tell her that I have received all her letters but I have written none to her purposely, feeling that she was soon to return and there was every danger of my letters missing her, especially as I am in an out of the way place where there is no post office worth the name and no telegraph office at all.
('93', 109, 3, 18, 222633) Naturally I am not in touch with what is going on in Delhi.
('93', 109, 3, 19, 222693) If my mission succeeds here I shall be fit enough for further work.
('93', 109, 3, 20, 222761) Anyway, so far as I know, I have to bury myself here till mutual confidence and friendship between the communities are restored.
('93', 109, 3, 21, 222890) What happens here will happen throughout India, because Bengal is the nerve centre.

('93', 110, 2, 3, 223144) DEAR BHAKTI, I have your very good letter.
('93', 110, 2, 4, 223187) I am sorry that you are not getting Harijan at all.
('93', 110, 2, 5, 223239) I am inquiring.
('93', 110, 2, 6, 223255) Probably there is some legal difficulty in sending Harijan to foreign parts.
('93', 110, 2, 7, 223332) I cannot understand that the Manager has neglected your copy.
('93', 110, 2, 8, 223394) Pyarelalji tells me that the paper edited by Anand 1 is being received.
('93', 110, 2, 9, 223466) Of course, under the new arrangement all the co workers are distributed in the affected villages of Noakhali.
('93', 110, 2, 10, 223576) I am hoping with you that some day we shall meet again.
('93', 110, 2, 11, 223632) How, when and where, God alone knows.
('93', 110, 2, 12, 223670) Of course I remember the occasion when I called you babes in the wood which you always will be to me.
('93', 110, 2, 13, 223772) Love to you both.

('93', 111, 3, 4, 224034) NARANDAS, Your letter calls for a reply.
('93', 111, 3, 5, 224075) I have resumed my normal food.
('93', 111, 3, 6, 224106) Hence there is no cause at all now for worry.
('93', 111, 3, 7, 224152) Really speaking worry has no place in a thoughtful life.
('93', 111, 3, 8, 224209) The present mission is the most complicated of all I have undertaken in my life.I cannot see my path in the thick darkness of the night, take this your child under your protecting care.
('93', 111, 3, 9, 224395) Light up the path of my life.I can sing these lines 1
('93', 111, 4, 10, 224449) with perfect truth.
('93', 111, 4, 11, 224469) I do not remember to have experienced such darkness in my life ever before, and the night seems long.
('93', 111, 4, 12, 224571) My only consolation is that I have not accepted defeat or given way to despair.
('93', 111, 4, 13, 224651) His will be done.
('93', 111, 4, 14, 224669) I mean to do or die here.To do means to restore amity between Hindus and Muslims; or I should perish in the attempt.
('93', 111, 4, 15, 224786) This is difficult to achieve.
('93', 111, 4, 16, 224816) But it will be as God wills.
('93', 111, 4, 17, 224845) All the co workers have offered themselves up in this sacrifice of their own accord, but if they repent, they are free to leave.
('93', 111, 4, 18, 224974) They have been posted, each in one village, with a Bengali interpreter to help him or her.
('93', 111, 4, 19, 225065) Kanaiyo also is away from me as a part of this plan, and so is Abha.
('93', 111, 4, 20, 225134) I am camping in an unfortunate village in the interior.
('93', 111, 4, 21, 225190) Parasuram, who cannot be posted alone because of the language difficulty, is with me.
('93', 111, 4, 22, 225276) He is a silent worker and an expert stenogr apher.
('93', 111, 4, 23, 225327) The other is a Bengali professor.
('93', 111, 4, 24, 225361) Both give me perso nal services, too.
('93', 111, 4, 25, 225399) Most of the others are at a distance of ten miles from me.
('93', 111, 4, 26, 225458) They can come and see me whenever it is necessary.
('93', 111, 4, 27, 225509) Pyarelal, Sushila Nayyar and Sushila Pai also are camping in different villages.
('93', 111, 4, 28, 225590) Kanaiyo had fever for one day.
('93', 111, 4, 29, 225621) He is better now.
('93', 111, 4, 30, 225639) There is no cause for worry.
('93', 111, 4, 31, 225668) He himself is quite cheerful.
('93', 111, 4, 32, 225698) He leads the Ramdhun and remains fearless.
('93', 111, 4, 33, 225741) God has blessed him with fine health.
('93', 111, 4, 34, 225779) Abha is perfectly safe.
('93', 111, 4, 35, 225803) She has gone with Bapa.
('93', 111, 4, 36, 225827) She is in a village sixteen miles away.
('93', 111, 4, 37, 225867) Kanaiyo preferred this arrangement.
('93', 111, 4, 38, 225903) Bapa has taken great interest in her and is pleased with her spirit of service.

('93', 112, 1, 4, 226296) I had also started regarding her services as a necessity.
('93', 112, 1, 5, 226354) However, in this difficult sadhana of mine, how can I afford to make a habit of getting service from others?
('93', 112, 1, 6, 226463) You will now see that every step taken is being dictated by dharma.

('93', 112, 9, 22, 227168) December 5, 1946 Put yourself in Mr. Suhrawardys shoes; do you think he would favour it, or even the Muslim residents of Noakhali?
('93', 112, 9, 23, 227299) For it would be interpreted as a preparation for war.
('93', 112, 9, 24, 227353) But if you believe that this is the only workable scheme, you can go ahead with it.
('93', 112, 9, 25, 227437) For myself, the path is different.
('93', 112, 9, 26, 227472) I have become a Bengali to

Bose explains: Nirmal Chandra Chatterji and Debendranath Mukherjee, President and Secretary of the Hindu Mahasabha, Naren Bose, brother of Suren Bose, the first victim of Noakhali, and a few others had a 45 minute interview when the Mahasabhas project of segregating the Hindu population in Noakhali for purposes of safety was discussed.

('93', 113, 1, 2, 227904) all intents and purposes.
('93', 113, 1, 3, 227930) Today Nirmal Babu is my ears and is indisp ensable, but when I learn enough Bengali, he will be free to go.
('93', 113, 2, 4, 228038) Then he explained his own planhow he had already posted one worker in each village, with a Bengali interpreter where necessary, in order to steal the hearts of the inhabitants.
('93', 113, 2, 5, 228215) It did not matter if there was only one or many Hindus in a village; his prescription was that they should stick to their posts and even face death, if necessary, with courage and willingness.
('93', 113, 2, 6, 228408) If they lived in clusters, it would really mean accepting the Muslim Leagues mischievous two nation theory.
('93', 113, 2, 7, 228516) Then he added : If there has to be migration at all, it must be complete.
('93', 113, 2, 8, 228590) I am not going to be a willing party to Pakistan.
('93', 113, 2, 9, 228640) Even if I fail to prevent it and all Hindus go away, I shall still remain here; and shall not make a single change in my religious practice.
('93', 113, 3, 10, 228781) Nirmal Babu remarked that no one had taken to this advice so far, as the scheme was beyond the strength of the average individual.
('93', 113, 3, 11, 228912) Gandhiji replied : If some could die like this, the few shall become many.
('93', 113, 3, 12, 228987) I am not a visionary as I am generally supposed to be.
('93', 113, 3, 13, 229042) I am an idealist, but I claim to be a practical idealist.
('93', 113, 3, 14, 229100) I have been born a Hindu and I shall die a Hindu, a sanatanist Hindu.
('93', 113, 3, 15, 229170) If there is salvation for me, it must be as a Hindu.
('93', 113, 3, 16, 229223) Hinduism absorbs the best in other religions, and there is scope for expansion in it.
('93', 113, 4, 17, 229309) Nirmal Babu thanked him for his kindness in thus taking up the cause of Bengal.
('93', 113, 4, 18, 229389) Gandhiji immediately replied that it was no kindness and if it was, it was kindness to himself.
('93', 113, 4, 19, 229485) He said : My own doctrine was failing.
('93', 113, 4, 20, 229524) I dont want to die a failure but as a successful man.

('93', 113, 7, 25, 229763) What you have written is reasonable, but I feel that this resistance to evil is not honest.
('93', 113, 7, 26, 229855) My point is that the whole game is lost if we resort to the law of the jungle.
('93', 113, 7, 27, 229934) One may react to violence by counter violence, but that counter violence can be either brutal or civilized and effective.
('93', 113, 7, 28, 230056) What happened in Bihar was brutal and ineffective and so was the case in Garhmukteshwar.
('93', 113, 7, 29, 230145) In such matters the precedents from Mahabharata and Bhagavata can mislead us.
('93', 113, 7, 30, 230223) Our life, that is, the ways of our people should become thoughtful and orderly.

('93', 114, 5, 9, 230636) SRIRAMPUR, December 6, 1946
('93', 114, 6, 10, 230664) Gandhiji began his after prayer speech by saying that true prayer never went unanswered.
('93', 114, 6, 11, 230753) It did not mean that every little thing we asked for from God was readily given to us.
('93', 114, 6, 12, 230840) It was only when we shed our selfishness with conscious effort and approached God in true humility that our prayers found a response.
('93', 114, 7, 13, 230974) In the Ashram prayer nothing was asked.
('93', 114, 7, 14, 231014) The prayer was for God to make them better men and women.
('93', 114, 7, 15, 231072) If the prayer came truly from the heart, Gods grace would surely descend upon them.
('93', 114, 7, 16, 231156) There was not a blade of grass which moved without his will, not one single true thought which did not leave a mark on character.
('93', 114, 7, 17, 231286) It was good, therefore, to develop the daily habit of prayer.

('93', 114, 9, 22, 231548) I think you cannot leave Wardha.
('93', 114, 9, 23, 231581) Being the Kaka of Wardha you have a responsibility which you cannot forsake.

('93', 115, 6, 17, 232692) BHAI JUGAL KISHORE, Baba Raghavdas gave me a full account of the passing away of Malaviyaji.
('93', 115, 6, 18, 232785) He also mentioned your pledge.
('93', 115, 6, 19, 232816) You should therefore certainly set apart Rs. 25 lacs for the temple 1. However, I am afraid, it will not be conducive to the progress of Hinduism if Malaviyajis concept of the temple complex is translated literally.
('93', 115, 6, 20, 233032) If the spirit of his concept is followed, it would raise Hinduism to greater heights.
('93', 115, 6, 21, 233118) Today Hinduism is being compared with other religions.
('93', 115, 6, 22, 233173) Under the circumstances, if we followed [his words] literally Hinduism would perish, while the spirit behind them will put new life into it.
('93', 115, 6, 23, 233314) Baba Raghavdas will tell you the rest.

('93', 116, 3, 4, 233605) Gandhiji referred in his few words to a writing by a Mussalman.
('93', 116, 3, 5, 233669) In it the writer had rightly contended that a man of God was never afraid to die or to lose his possessions for the sake of his self respect or religion.
('93', 116, 3, 6, 233823) God had given us life and could take it away.
('93', 116, 3, 7, 233869) That teaching was universal and applied to all, Hindus as well as Mussalmans.
('93', 116, 3, 8, 233947) Those who had in God their sole refuge cast out all fear.
('93', 116, 3, 9, 234005) Then there could be lasting friendship between the two.
('93', 116, 3, 10, 234061) He had been trying all these days to din this lesson into the ears of his listeners.
('93', 116, 3, 11, 234146) There was a time when Mussalmans also listened to him; but now things seemed to have changed and even among Hindus there were not many who would follow his advice.
('93', 116, 3, 12, 234310) But he felt sure lasting peace could come only when men of whatever community refused to surrender to any fear save the holy fear of God.

('93', 116, 5, 16, 234519) PYARELAL, I have your letter and also the description.
('93', 116, 5, 17, 234574) The description is good.
('93', 116, 5, 18, 234599) It moved me deeply.
('93', 116, 5, 19, 234619) It is true that the sooner all of us learn Bengali the better will it be.
('93', 116, 5, 20, 234693) I have always believed that the task is a difficult one.
('93', 116, 5, 21, 234750) There will be nothing more difficult than this in my lifetime.
('93', 116, 5, 22, 234813) We shall survive if God wills.
('93', 116, 5, 23, 234844) You are not to rush in where the situation is dangerous.
('93', 116, 5, 24, 234901) We have to suffer what falls to our lot.
('93', 116, 5, 25, 234942) I feel that it would have been all right even if you had not gone to that place.
('93', 116, 5, 26, 235023) Anyway I am not upset about it.
('93', 116, 5, 27, 235055) Let us all die while doing our duty.
('93', 116, 5, 28, 235092) Sushila is sitting by my side.

('93', 117, 2, 3, 235369) [After December 7, 1946] 2
('93', 117, 3, 4, 235396) It is my firm conviction that the education imparted by the British administration, whether at the primary or the higher level, is not conducive to the progress of India, nor could it ever have been so.
('93', 117, 3, 5, 235599) I have no doubt that only the scheme of education devised by the Talimi Sangh is the right education.
('93', 117, 3, 6, 235701) And that is meant for all village people whether Hindus or others.

('93', 118, 5, 13, 237463) I think your way of service has changed.
('93', 118, 5, 14, 237504) You cannot now undertake the risks involved in the work here.
('93', 118, 5, 15, 237566) The task here is a difficult one.
('93', 118, 5, 16, 237600) Your duty is to live with Kanchan and make her perfectly happy.
('93', 118, 5, 17, 237664) That is your swadharma.
('93', 118, 5, 18, 237688) I see your spiritual progress only through her happiness.
('93', 118, 5, 19, 237746) Whatever happens will be for the good.
('93', 118, 5, 20, 237785) You are doing right in supervising the construction of the hospital buildings.
('93', 118, 5, 21, 237864) Take similar interest in the other activities there and do them well.
('93', 118, 5, 22, 237934) In whatever you do you should have Kanchans fullest mental co operation.
('93', 118, 5, 23, 238007) Physical co operation she does give, willingly or unwillingly.
('93', 118, 5, 24, 238070) But work is true karma only when both body and mind co operate.
('93', 118, 5, 25, 238134) This is nothing to be ashamed of.
('93', 118, 5, 26, 238168) On the contrary, that is the right way to live and only those who live in this way make any progress.
('93', 118, 6, 27, 238270) He who curbs the organs of action but allows the mind to dwell on the sense objects, such a one, wholly deludedis called a hypocrite.
('93', 118, 6, 28, 238404) Reflect over this verse 1 and rejoice.
('93', 118, 6, 29, 238443) Kanchan should write to me as long as she has the strength to do so.
('93', 118, 6, 30, 238512) The rest if and when we meet.

('93', 119, 3, 4, 238779) BABUDI, I have your letter.
('93', 119, 3, 5, 238807) I do respect your eagerness to go and stay with Gordhandas.
('93', 119, 3, 6, 238867) I know, however, that in your present condition you will not be a help but a burden to him.
('93', 119, 3, 7, 238959) The better course would be for you to stay in Sevagram, to get well and do as much service there as you can.
('93', 119, 3, 8, 239068) If, however, Gordhandas does not like that, it would certainly be your duty to respect his wishes.
('93', 119, 3, 9, 239167) I shall enclose with this the letter I am going to write 1 to him.
('93', 119, 3, 10, 239234) If Chimanlal and you agree, he may leave that place.
('93', 119, 3, 11, 239287) If you also cannot be happy there, I think it useless to force you to stay on.
('93', 119, 3, 12, 239366) I think your remaining there is best for everybody.
('93', 119, 3, 13, 239418) You are living there as a matter of right and not on sufferance.
('93', 119, 3, 14, 239483) You belong to the Ashram.

('93', 119, 9, 25, 239956) If she has any difficulties, remove them.
('93', 119, 9, 26, 239998) She must not feel the slightest want in regard to food.

('93', 120, 5, 10, 240836) Sharda is still not getting well.
('93', 120, 5, 11, 240870) She is now impatient to go to you.
('93', 120, 5, 12, 240905) If you need her, it is her duty to go and it is our duty as her elders to send her.
('93', 120, 5, 13, 240989) But I believe that as long as she remains ill she will not be of any help to you.
('93', 120, 5, 14, 241071) If you wish to have her near you in the hope that that will benefit her health, I would count it as your ignorance.
('93', 120, 5, 15, 241187) From the point of view both of climate and other facilities, Sevagram is the right place for Sharda.
('93', 120, 5, 16, 241288) I am keen that she should first get well and then go to you and help you.
('93', 120, 5, 17, 241362) If she has patience, with Gods grace she is bound to get well.
('93', 120, 5, 18, 241425) Since she has not lost any weight, we can certainly hope for improvement.
('93', 120, 5, 19, 241499) By and by the fever is bound to go.
('93', 120, 5, 20, 241535) Notwithstanding what I think, however, ultimately, what you wish will be done.

('93', 120, 10, 25, 241766) Gandhiji said that a friend had sent him a book containing the sayings of Prophet Mohammed.
('93', 120, 10, 26, 241858) He read the book whenever he could snatch a few minutes time.
('93', 120, 10, 27, 241920) Today he tried to select something out of the book for them.
('93', 120, 10, 28, 241981) Both Hindu and Muslim friends were assembled there and these sayings were such that both ought to practice what they learnt from them.
('93', 120, 11, 29, 242116) If men lived according to these precepts, then there would be an end to all

('93', 121, 4, 22, 243458) Acting on your letter, I have already written to Sushila and told her to proceed there with or without the children.
('93', 121, 4, 23, 243575) I would not risk doing anything against your wishes in this matter.

('93', 122, 10, 22, 244954) DEAR SATIS BABU 2, Did Krishnadas tell you about the very silly mistake made, viz., that you had gone to your rest?
('93', 122, 10, 23, 245070) How I came to have that impression I cannot make out except for the fact that I had not heard from you for a long time.
('93', 122, 10, 24, 245190) You can therefore imagine my joy when he told me that you were very much alive, were able to have regular walks and were able to give instruction to true seekers as usual.

('93', 123, 1, 3, 245915) I am trying hard to reach that state.
('93', 123, 1, 4, 245953) Do please write to me when you have the time.

('93', 123, 5, 8, 246080) December 9, 1946
('93', 123, 6, 9, 246097) When Deobhankar asked him as to how the Muslim masses could be won over and unified under the Congress and if this could not be achieved best through some form of economic struggle along class lines, Gandhiji replied that so far such a plan had not succeeded in respect of the people whose communal sentiment had proved too strong.
('93', 123, 6, 10, 246429) What we had to do was to prevent the Congress from turning into a Hindu communal organization.
('93', 123, 6, 11, 246524) Anyone who had made India his home should be protected by the Congress.
('93', 123, 6, 12, 246596) Hindus should never think that Hindustan belonged exclusively to them.
('93', 123, 6, 13, 246667) The Parsis had come centuries ago, and the Syrian Christians were Christians ever since the time of St. Thomas.
('93', 123, 6, 14, 246779) Every one of them had to be treated as an Indian enjoying the same rights as any other Indian.
('93', 123, 7, 15, 246874) Congressmen should not however approach Muslims in a spirit of appeasement or flattery.
('93', 123, 7, 16, 246962) Although something like that had been done, and it might even be justifiably said that he himself had partly been responsible for such an attitude, yet, his eyes were now opened and he held that it had been unwise to do so.
('93', 123, 7, 17, 247186) It was by safeguarding every persons legitimate interests that Congressmen could prove their genuine love of nationalism.
('93', 123, 7, 18, 247308) He did not mind even if the Congress were manned by Hindus alone.
('93', 123, 7, 19, 247374) If its members placed the cause of the whole nation above everything else, then their idealism would ultimately triumph over communalism.
('93', 123, 8, 20, 247512) What the Hindus or Mussalmans had exhibited so far in Bengal or Bihar was violence mixed with cowardice; there was no element of bravery in it.
('93', 123, 8, 21, 247656) To those who did not believe in non violence, he could hypothetically suggest a more civilized form of revenge than what they had actually been guilty of.
('93', 123, 8, 22, 247811) Supposing there were a Government in Bihar which believed in violence and not in non violence, they could have written to the Government in Bengal after the Calcutta riots, Now, here are the inhabitants of this province who have returned from Calcutta.

('93', 124, 1, 2, 248311) furious and are bent upon taking revenge on the 14 per cent of Mussalmans in Bihar.
('93', 124, 1, 3, 248395) But we will prevent them from doing so, if we can.
('93', 124, 1, 4, 248446) In the meanwhile, you should do everything to stop the riot which is even now going on in Bengal.
('93', 124, 2, 5, 248544) Along with sending such a letter to the Muslim League Government in Bengal, the Government of Bihar should have kept the Muslims of Bihar informed about their efforts.
('93', 124, 2, 6, 248712) If conditions in Bengal did not improve, they could have notified the Bengal Government that unless the Bihar Muslims left the province for Bengal within, say, eight days, they would have to send the latter forcibly over to Bengal rather than allow them to be butchered in Bihar.
('93', 124, 2, 7, 248992) And when the eight days had passed, they might have taken necessary steps for evacuating the Muslims of Bihar.
('93', 124, 3, 8, 249103) It was quite likely that the Muslims of Bihar would have refused to move and declared that they were with the Congress rather than with the League in the policy that the latter had been pursuing in Bengal.
('93', 124, 3, 9, 249309) That would have meant a victory for the Congress not only in Bihar but in all those provinces where the Government was run by the Congress.
('93', 124, 4, 10, 249449) Such action, though fully violent, would have been better than that to which Bihar had lowered herself today.
('93', 124, 4, 11, 249559) Violence, when cowardly, only served to degrade and did not yield the desired political result.
('93', 124, 4, 12, 249655) Gandhiji lastly said that today he was seeking for a non violent solution for his own sake alone.
('93', 124, 4, 13, 249753) For the time being, he had given up searching for a non violent remedy applicable to the masses.
('93', 124, 4, 14, 249850) He had yet to see if non violence would prove successful in the present crisis or not.
('93', 124, 4, 15, 249937) He expected that things would take a definite turn one way or the other within two months and not remain uncertain as they were at the present moment.

('93', 124, 8, 19, 250171) Gandhiji, in a short address, told them that it was their duty to take Ramanama at least twice a day, morning and evening.
('93', 124, 8, 20, 250294) They must take Ramanama in difficult and troublesome days as they did in peaceful days when they lived a peaceful life without fear from anyone.

('93', 125, 7, 16, 251360) Gandhiji told them that since his arrival in Noakhali he had been telling them all to be fearless.
('93', 125, 7, 17, 251459) If they acted accordingly and were fearless in all their work, they could live in peace.
('93', 125, 7, 18, 251548) Pointing towards the sky, Gandhiji said : Believe in Him.
('93', 125, 7, 19, 251606) Pray to Him and fear Him alone, and none in this world.

('93', 125, 11, 23, 251740) If Hindus and Muslims in India gathered courage and cast from their hearts the fear of loss of possessions and life the face of India would change in no time, Gandhiji said.
('93', 125, 11, 24, 251914) But the reformed social relations must be based upon character built on the rock of fearlessness; only thus could true mutual trust be generated.
('93', 125, 11, 25, 252060) He referred to the saying of Prophet Mohammed quoted on Sunday last and said that in every

('93', 126, 1, 2, 252477) religion there was a common fund of spiritual experience which applied all over the world.
('93', 126, 2, 3, 252568) Whatever differences struck our eyes were the results of requirements limited to particular epochs of time and place.
('93', 126, 2, 4, 252686) Indeed there were as many religions as there were men on earth; for the needs of no two men were wholly alike.
('93', 126, 2, 5, 252797) In spite of that, the commonness underlying all the religions could never be missed.
('93', 126, 2, 6, 252882) A tree had a single stem, many branches and innumerable leaves, no two of which were wholly alike; it was even so in the case of religion.
('93', 126, 3, 7, 253021) No religion today was without blemishes.
('93', 126, 3, 8, 253062) Islam had given rise to the noblest of characters and he counted among his friends men who stood tall and high over their neighbours.
('93', 126, 3, 9, 253196) But unwanted accretions had gathered in the practice of Islam, which ran counter to the fundamental teachings of that religion.
('93', 126, 4, 10, 253324) Similarly, Christian nations, who followed their Master, who taught mankind to love their enemies, had been responsible for two major wars during our generation, which had blighted the face of earth and had left a legacy of suspicion, hatred and violence from which the whole world was suffering today.
('93', 126, 5, 11, 253627) In Hinduism too, diabolical wrong had been perpetrated in the name of religion.
('93', 126, 5, 12, 253707) Our so called untouchable brethren had been reduced to a condition which was the very opposite of human dignity.
('93', 126, 5, 13, 253820) Indeed this very charge had been laid against us by General Smuts at the United Nations Assembly in America when Shrimati Vijayalakshmi Pandit demanded justice against the treatment meted out to us in South Africa.
('93', 126, 6, 14, 254035) Gandhiji wound up by saying that both Hindus and Muslims were like blood brothers.
('93', 126, 6, 15, 254118) They were nourished by food grown from the same soil, quenched their thirst by water of the same river and finally laid themselves to rest in the same earth.
('93', 126, 6, 16, 254276) If they feared God, they would fear no one else.

('93', 127, 1, 4, 255257) I claim that I have come as a friend as much of the Mus lims as of the Hindus in this part of the world.
('93', 127, 1, 5, 255362) You may recall my visit to Champaran in the very early period of my etur to the mother land.

('93', 128, 1, 2, 256883) you should stay, not otherwise.
('93', 128, 1, 3, 256915) I have advised that the stipulated sum should be collected as was desired by Panditji 1. Therefore, an appeal should go from the University to the Princes.
('93', 128, 1, 4, 257071) They can easily find the sum expected of them and if it is properly managed they will do so.
('93', 128, 1, 5, 257164) Businessmen will find their portion and the rest will come easily.
('93', 128, 1, 6, 257231) But all this can and should be done only if a living, befitting temple is built.
('93', 128, 1, 7, 257312) The whole of the sum will not be spent in stone and mortar.
('93', 128, 1, 8, 257372) Some marble is necessary.
('93', 128, 1, 9, 257398) It should be a unique thing.
('93', 128, 1, 10, 257427) It ought not to contain any idol.

('93', 128, 1, 12, 257523) Such a model structure but very artistic has been built in the Harijan Colony, Kingsway, Delhi.
('93', 128, 1, 13, 257619) You have seen it.
('93', 128, 1, 14, 257637) The one in the Viswa Vidyalaya grounds will be twenty times larger, with a great dome with proper acoustic properties, to accommodate an unlimited number of people.
('93', 128, 1, 15, 257802) It will be a striking thing and there should be a daily service conducted there by priests who will show piety in every one of their activities, private and public.

('93', 128, 1, 20, 258192) He was much greater than he himself knew.
('93', 128, 1, 21, 258234) But his limitations were amazing.

('93', 129, 3, 4, 258697) DEAR PROFESSOR, Sucheta is still in Calcutta attending to her ailing sister.
('93', 129, 3, 5, 258774) I have asked her not to hasten so long as in her opinion her presence in Calcutta is necessary for her sister.
('93', 129, 3, 6, 258885) She has not sent me the medical certificate but in her letters she says she will hand it to me when she comes.
('93', 129, 3, 7, 258996) You may depend upon my not letting her overdo things to the damage of her health.
('93', 129, 3, 8, 259078) I will see that she is quite safe with me.
('93', 129, 3, 9, 259121) Yours is no easy job.
('93', 129, 3, 10, 259143) But probably it is more difficult than you or I had imagined.
('93', 129, 3, 11, 259205) I do not think of the two letters of which you have sent me copies in the way you do.
('93', 129, 3, 12, 259291) I think they are honest letters.
('93', 129, 3, 13, 259324) Evidently, they have remained members of the Committee, but if I were you I would not insist on their remaining.
('93', 129, 3, 14, 259437) I will take them at their word and have new blood with you, and I would say that if you find that you are unable to shape the organization in the best way possible and if they let you resign you should do so without a moments thought.
('93', 129, 3, 15, 259672) We can only think of the organization we serve and nothing else.

('93', 129, 3, 17, 259821) It contained copies of her note prepa red for the Congress and another note prepared by her on her experiences of Garhmukteshwar.
('93', 129, 3, 18, 259951) You must have seen both.
('93', 129, 3, 19, 259976) I liked them.
('93', 129, 3, 20, 259990) I read the note on the Congress organization only today.
('93', 129, 3, 21, 260047) Her suggestions make a forcible appeal to me.
('93', 129, 3, 22, 260093) I would advise you to ask her to see you and discuss all her proposals with you and enlist her services as also Keskars 1 to the extent that they allow you to do so.
('93', 129, 3, 23, 260259) I think that you should discuss her suggestions with Jawaharlal and let him take an active part in carrying them out.
('93', 129, 3, 24, 260377) Whether he remains a member or whether he does not, I would not for one moment question his downright honesty.
('93', 129, 3, 25, 260488) He promises to render all the help he can and I have no doubt that he will do so and perhaps more efficiently, because he would then enjoy freedom of action which he will not do otherwise.

('93', 130, 1, 3, 260807) It is a terrible problem and a great responsibility rests upon the Congress nowtherefore, the greatest on you.You have asked me to send for you if I want to.
('93', 130, 1, 4, 260965) I am not likely to do so, but I do want to feel that you are at liberty to come at any time you like without notice, if you want to consult me about anything.
('93', 130, 1, 5, 261124) Personally I would say that you should do as your reason and conscience tell you, irrespective of what I may think or may not think.
('93', 130, 1, 6, 261257) I am too much engrossed in the work before me to think of anything else, unless a letter like yours moves me.

('93', 130, 6, 19, 261991) But these days I cannot keep a complete list for I am practically alone.
('93', 130, 6, 20, 262064) You need not worry about me at all.
('93', 130, 6, 21, 262100) I am quite well.

('93', 131, 2, 4, 262505) In reply I have sent you a telegram which you must have received.
('93', 131, 2, 5, 262571) In order to make progress you must not do what you wish to do, you must follow my instructions.
('93', 131, 2, 6, 262667) Your first duty, as I see it from this distance, is to improve your health.
('93', 131, 2, 7, 262743) Whether you have to stay at Benares for six months or more will be decided by me, and that too after seeing how you fare there.
('93', 131, 2, 8, 262871) After all you will render some service even at Benares.
('93', 131, 2, 9, 262927) I am not here entirely unattended.
('93', 131, 2, 10, 262962) I am being looked after very well.

('93', 132, 6, 18, 264563) The deputation headed by Shrimati Vijayalakshmi Pandit and sent to the U. N. O. Conference by the Interim Government has undoubtedly done very effective work with marked ability and success.
('93', 132, 6, 19, 264754) That is clear from the following cablegram sent by Shrimati Vijayalakshmi Pandit from New York :
('93', 132, 7, 20, 264851) Today with your blessings justice of South African Indian cause was vindicated.
('93', 132, 7, 21, 264931) Committee voting twenty four to nineteen in our favour.
('93', 132, 7, 22, 264987) Went to General Smuts after meeting and shook hands.
('93', 132, 7, 23, 265040) He expressed appreciation at manner in which I had conducted case.
('93', 132, 8, 24, 265107) It remains now to be seen how the Parliament of the Union of South Africa and its European public respond.
('93', 132, 8, 25, 265214) Field Mar shal Smuts was able to hurl at the Indian deputation the taunt that India treated her so called untouchables, legally described as the Scheduled Classes, much worse than the Union treated her Asiatics or for that matter the Africans.
('93', 132, 8, 26, 265458) There would be much to be said for
('93', 132, 9, 27, 265493) 1 Pyarelal explains : After the morning walk he felt so utterly exhausted that he had to lie in bed.
('93', 132, 9, 28, 265594) It must have been about midnight when he got up to visit the chamber pot. 2 According to a report in The Bombay Chronicle, 30 11 1946, Vijayalakshmi Pandit, in her reply to Heaton Nichols of South Africa before the U. N. General Assembly had said : When I was coming here I saw Mahatma Gandhi, who is very much interested in this whole case.
('93', 132, 9, 29, 265936) He said to me as I was leaving : I do not mind whether you come back having won your case or having suffered defeat; but you must come back as a friend of General Smuts. And that is not what any man in Mahatma Gandhis position would have said.
('93', 133, 0, 1, 266180) 134 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('93', 133, 1, 2, 266222) the Field Marshals taunt if it was true.
('93', 133, 1, 3, 266263) It is true of South Africa that her treatment of Asiatics has legally deteriorated from time to time, so much so that it has now become well nigh unbearable.
('93', 133, 1, 4, 266421) Almost every promise made by the Union Government to the Government of India has now been broken.
('93', 133, 1, 5, 266519) In India, on the other hand, there never has been any law carrying the bar sinister against the Scheduled Classes.
('93', 133, 1, 6, 266634) It can be proved up to the hilt that the law has always sought to protect the Scheduled Classes.
('93', 133, 1, 7, 266731) There is no legal bar, so far as I am aware, against any of the Scheduled Classes being regarded as equal in status to the tallest Indian.
('93', 133, 1, 8, 266870) What is however true to the shame of orthodox Hinduism and the Sanatani Hindus is that religious custom has denied to these untouchables the rights which the law has allowed, and it is unfortunately also true that sometimes custom overrides the law.
('93', 133, 1, 9, 267120) But public opinion is progressively rising against this barbarous custom and it is merely a question of time when the custom will be swept out of existence.
('93', 133, 1, 10, 267277) Let us, therefore, hope that instead of taking doubtful advantage of the things in India which no one defends and against which public opinion is pro gressively rising, the Europeans of the Union of South Africa will recog nize that if the U. N. O. Conference is any index of world opinion, it is decidedly against the European prejudice which has hardened into law.

('93', 133, 4, 14, 267756) Your suggestion is that people of the same culture should be brought together in a common territory and placed under a common government.
('93', 133, 4, 15, 267894) Of course, for administrative purposes, men have to be divided into groups.
('93', 133, 4, 16, 267970) This is best done on economic grounds or on the basis of linguistic unity.
('93', 133, 4, 17, 268045) What Gandhiji objects to is the redistribution of population on the basis of religion.
('93', 133, 4, 18, 268132) That would mean an admission that people of different faiths cannot live on friendly terms within the same State.
('93', 133, 4, 19, 268246) The Muslim League has suggested a similar remedy for the present Hindu Muslim tension, when the minority who remain over in each Province will be held as hostages for the good behaviour of the majority in the

('93', 134, 1, 3, 268826) This would amount to an armed truce and not peace on terms of equality, friendship and mutual trust.
('93', 134, 1, 4, 268927) To cut up India into specifically religious zones, and then redistribute population to fit in with such an artificial scheme would, in Gandhijis opinion, be monstrous.
('93', 134, 1, 5, 269095) For it will cut across many of the linguistic, cultural and fundamental bonds of co operation which have held together our people in the past.

('93', 134, 4, 9, 269445) Those who do not feel the necessary confidence in themselves, can certainly not be advised to return.
('93', 134, 5, 10, 269547) Gandhiji keenly feels that any word from his mouth cannot bring courage to anyone; and he would not therefore advise any person to return home by relying upon such a frail reed.

('93', 134, 8, 16, 269921) Manu had asked for a wire in reply to the first and I had, therefore, wired to say that you could come over and leave Manu with me on condition that she would stay with me till the end.
('93', 134, 8, 17, 270107) I find the second letter in a different strain.
('93', 134, 8, 18, 270155) If both of you believe that the atmosphere here is impure, how can Manu stay with me ?
('93', 134, 8, 19, 270242) I can certainly see that nobody harasses her.
('93', 134, 8, 20, 270288) Whether or not she should talk with Pyarelal will be left to her choice.
('93', 134, 8, 21, 270361) Just now he is in one village, I in another.
('93', 134, 8, 22, 270406) If she does not want even to see him, she will be able to keep that resolve too.

('93', 135, 4, 21, 271881) They always say: Lead us from darkness to light, from untruth to truth. The Ramdhun has also a story behind it.
('93', 135, 4, 22, 271993) Once Saint Tulsidas was touring on foot different shrines even as Chaitanya Mahaprabhu had walked to Puri and Brindavan, and reached the temple of Dakore.
('93', 135, 4, 23, 272148) That temple is dedicated to Vishnu.
('93', 135, 4, 24, 272184) Tulsidas said to himself that unless God revealed himself in the form of his favourite Rama, his head would not bow in obeisance.
('93', 135, 4, 25, 272314) The story has it that this happened and the devout pilgrim saw before him seated in all their glory Rama and Sita surrounded by Lakshmana, Shatrughna and Hanuman.
('93', 135, 4, 26, 272477) Hence the Ramdhun, meaning intoxication of God.
('93', 135, 5, 27, 272525) 1 The report said : Two friends who had joined the days evening prayer had sung a song which Gandhiji had chosen as the theme of his after prayer speech.
('93', 135, 5, 28, 272679) The purport of the song was prayer to God to light the lamp of truth in the heart after it had been freed from the blemishes by the abundance of Gods love.

('93', 136, 3, 6, 273167) The reason is plain.
('93', 136, 3, 7, 273188) The problem has one feature not to be found in any other, namely, that in this case adharma has been assumed to be dharma.
('93', 136, 3, 8, 273311) It takes time to explain and understand this.
('93', 136, 3, 9, 273357) Moreover, it requires great tapascharya to convince the people that what is known as dharma is in fact adharma.
('93', 136, 3, 10, 273469) Those who would do so effectively must themselves be perfect embodiments of dharma.
('93', 136, 3, 11, 273553) None of us are that.
('93', 136, 3, 12, 273574) We are full of liking and aversion, yearn for worldly pleasures, lack the capacity to love even our enemies, are without courage and self control.
('93', 136, 3, 13, 273721) Who will, therefore, listen to us?
('93', 136, 3, 14, 273756) This work requires not so much intellectual ability as spiritual strength.
('93', 136, 3, 15, 273831) If you think over the other items of the constructive programme, the difference I have explained will become clear to you.
('93', 136, 3, 16, 273954) Please have patience and do your utmost to cultivate the virtues I have mentioned above.

('93', 136, 5, 18, 274164) MANILAL, The fact that I have not written to you recently does not mean that I do not think about you or others and Uruli Kanchan.
('93', 136, 5, 19, 274295) I really feel sorry that I cannot write.
('93', 136, 5, 20, 274336) I spent, and made others spend, so much money over the things there, and at Panchgani too, and now God has tossed me here and is testing me.
('93', 136, 5, 21, 274477) All the time, therefore, the saying Gods will prevails echoes in my ears.

('93', 137, 1, 4, 274708) How are Dr. Bhagawats experiments progressing?
('93', 137, 1, 5, 274755) Are any dietetic experiments being conducted?
('93', 137, 1, 6, 274801) We dont get clean water anywhere here.
('93', 137, 1, 7, 274840) Can anybody there say how this water can be easily purified?
('93', 137, 1, 8, 274901) How is Dhiru?

('93', 137, 5, 25, 275433) SRIRAMPUR, December 13, 1946
('93', 137, 6, 26, 275462) The name Rakshi Dal did not appeal to Gandhiji.
('93', 137, 6, 27, 275510) Who could pretend to be the protector of another?
('93', 137, 6, 28, 275560) Each one had to learn the art of self protection whether it was a child of ten, a young girl or a grown up man.
('93', 137, 6, 29, 275672) If they felt they could protect themselves and others by means of violence alone, they should learn the art of warfare and the use of arms.
('93', 137, 6, 30, 275812) But in such an enterprise he could give them little aid.
('93', 137, 6, 31, 275869) Not only that, it had been his uniform experience that those who set out to protect others with the sword ended by turning oppressors themselves.
('93', 137, 6, 32, 276015) Under his plan, not many men were needed in a village for the protection of the few against many.
('93', 137, 6, 33, 276113) One or two would be enough.
('93', 137, 6, 34, 276141) If they laid down their lives in the performance of their duty without flinching and without anger in their hearts, their example would probably inspire others to exhibit non violent courage likewise, so that they would either be able to melt the hearts of their oppressors or die in the act of defending their self respect and honour in a non violent way.
('93', 137, 6, 35, 276498) He, therefore, advised the workers to turn themselves into Sevaks or servants rather than protectors.

('93', 139, 11, 23, 279594) Gandhiji in his speech said that although hospital work was not in his line, he had responded 2 to Dr. Das Guptas invitation because he was given to understand that

('93', 140, 1, 2, 280027) the workers were actuated solely by a spirit of service.
('93', 140, 1, 3, 280084) He knew that the task was a very delicate one today.
('93', 140, 1, 4, 280137) Refugees had gathered together in camps and it was up to the workers to create an atmosphere when they could safely return to their deserted homes.
('93', 140, 1, 5, 280285) Moreover, work here was not city work but lay in the villages where insanitation and wretched water supply had to be dealt with.
('93', 140, 2, 6, 280414) Those who read his writings in the Harijan knew that for some time past he had been advocating nature cure methods.
('93', 140, 2, 7, 280530) He confessed, this was an old love for him.
('93', 140, 2, 8, 280574) His experience, as years rolled by, had been that there could be no greater healer than God Himself.
('93', 140, 2, 9, 280675) It was only when man departed from the laws of Nature as set by Him that he became subject to diseases of body and mind.
('93', 140, 2, 10, 280796) It was usual for the medical profession to pay heed to the body exclusive of the mind and the spirit.
('93', 140, 2, 11, 280898) The result was bad.
('93', 140, 2, 12, 280918) The health of all the three was their supreme concern.
('93', 140, 2, 13, 280973) Here the chief malady was feara feeling which not only benumbed their senses, but also inhibited every attempt to restore conditions of healthy normal living.
('93', 140, 3, 14, 281132) The speaker had heard that Muslim villagers would not go to Hindu doctors.
('93', 140, 3, 15, 281207) He hoped it was wrong.
('93', 140, 3, 16, 281230) Medical profession knew no distinction between man and man, no matter to what faith he or she belonged.
('93', 140, 4, 17, 281334) It should be the aim of doctors posted here not to depend on foreign remedies.
('93', 140, 4, 18, 281413) The countryside was teeming with potent herbs.
('93', 140, 4, 19, 281460) Ayurvedic and Unani physicians made wide use of them.
('93', 140, 4, 20, 281514) Why should not doctors with Western learning make use of these cheap remedies?
('93', 140, 4, 21, 281593) Acharya Profulla Roy 1 , Gandhiji had noticed one day, used plain mustard oil and salt, instead of depending on many oils and pastes turned out by the Bengal Chemical Works.
('93', 140, 4, 22, 281767) When asked about it, Acharya Roy laughingly replied that those things were meant for simpletons and he was not going to add to their number by using them.

('93', 141, 7, 8, 282463) Asked for guidance in regard to the question of Grouping, 4 Gandhiji replied : I do not need a single minute to come to a decision, for on this I have a mind.
('93', 141, 7, 9, 282622) I am a Congressman to the very marrow, as I am mainly the framer of the constitution of the Congress as it stands today.
('93', 141, 7, 10, 282743) I told Bardoloi that if there is no clear guidance from the Congress Committee, Assam should not go into the Sections.
('93', 141, 7, 11, 282862) It should lodge its protest and retire from the Constituent Assembly.
('93', 141, 7, 12, 282932) It will be a kind of satyagraha against the Congress for the good of the Congress.
('93', 141, 7, 13, 283015) Rightly or wrongly, the Congress has come to the Decision that it will stand by the judgment of the Federal Court.
('93', 141, 7, 14, 283130) The dice are heavily loaded.
('93', 141, 7, 15, 283159) The decision of the Federal Court will go against the Congress interpretation of Grouping as far as I can make out, for the simple reason that the Cabinet has got legal advice which upholds their decision.
('93', 141, 7, 16, 283365) The Federal Court is the creation of the British.
('93', 141, 7, 17, 283415) It is a packed court.

('93', 142, 1, 2, 284208) whatever it may be.
('93', 142, 1, 3, 284228) If Assam keeps quiet, it is finished.
('93', 142, 1, 4, 284266) No one can force Assam to do what it does not want to do.
('93', 142, 1, 5, 284324) It is autonomous to a large extent today.
('93', 142, 1, 6, 284366) It must become fully independent and autonomous.
('93', 142, 1, 7, 284415) Whether you have that courage, grit and the gumption, I do not know.
('93', 142, 1, 8, 284484) You alone can say that.
('93', 142, 1, 9, 284508) But if you can make that declaration, it will be a fine thing.
('93', 142, 1, 10, 284571) As soon as the time comes for the Constituent Assembly to go into Sections you will say, Gentlemen, Assam retires. For the indepen dence of India it is the only condition.
('93', 142, 1, 11, 284743) Each unit must be able to decide and act for itself.
('93', 142, 1, 12, 284796) I am hoping that in this Assam will lead the way.
('93', 142, 1, 13, 284846) I have the same advice for the Sikhs.
('93', 142, 1, 14, 284884) But your position is much happier than that of the Sikhs.
('93', 142, 1, 15, 284942) You are a whole Province.
('93', 142, 1, 16, 284968) They are a community inside a Province.
('93', 142, 1, 17, 285008) But I feel every individual has the right to act for himself, just as I have.
('93', 142, 2, 18, 285086) Q. But we are told that the framing of the Constitution for the whole of India cannot be held up for the sake of Assam.
('93', 142, 2, 19, 285206) Assam cannot be allowed to block the way.
('93', 142, 3, 20, 285248) A. There is no need to do that.
('93', 142, 3, 21, 285280) That is why I say I am in utter darkness.
('93', 142, 3, 22, 285322) Why are not these simple truths evident to all after so many years?
('93', 142, 3, 23, 285390) If Assam retires, it does not block, but leads the way to Indias independence.
('93', 142, 4, 24, 285469) Q. The British Government has said that the Constitution framed by the Constituent Assembly cannot be imposed on unwilling units.
('93', 142, 4, 25, 285599) So, if some parts do not accept it, the British Parliament wont accept it.
('93', 142, 5, 26, 285674) A. Who is the British Government?
('93', 142, 5, 27, 285708) If we think indepen dence is going to descend on our heads from England or some where, we are greatly mistaken.
('93', 142, 5, 28, 285820) It wont be independence.
('93', 142, 5, 29, 285845) We will be crushed to atoms.
('93', 142, 5, 30, 285874) We are fluctuating between independence and helpless dependence.
('93', 142, 5, 31, 285939) The Cabinet Missions plan lies in between.
('93', 142, 5, 32, 285982) If we act rightly, there will be the full blown flower of indepen dence.
('93', 142, 5, 33, 286055) If we react wrongly, the blossom will wither away.
('93', 142, 5, 34, 286106) Mind you, the League standpoint is quite correct.
('93', 142, 5, 35, 286156) If they stand out, the Constituent Assembly cannot impose its Constitution on an unwilling party.
('93', 142, 5, 36, 286254) The British Government has no say in the matter one way or the other.
('93', 142, 5, 37, 286324) The British cannot interfere with the working of the Constituent Assembly.
('93', 142, 5, 38, 286399) Supposing the vast majority, including the Muslims and others form a constitution, you can defy the British Parliament if it seeks to interfere.
('93', 142, 5, 39, 286544) Power is in your hands.
('93', 142, 5, 40, 286568) Some such thing happened

('93', 143, 1, 2, 286635) in Ireland only recently.
('93', 143, 1, 3, 286661) And de Valera is no non violent fighter.
('93', 143, 1, 4, 286702) The position of India is far better than that of Ireland.
('93', 143, 1, 5, 286760) If we have not the penetration, we will lose the advantage we have, as it is apparently being lost today.
('93', 143, 1, 6, 286866) If Assam takes care of itself, the rest of India, will be able to look after itself.
('93', 143, 1, 7, 286951) What have you got to do with the constitution of the Union Government?
('93', 143, 1, 8, 287022) You should form your own constitution.
('93', 143, 1, 9, 287061) That is enough.
('93', 143, 1, 10, 287077) You have the basis of a constitution all right even now.
('93', 143, 1, 11, 287134) I have never despised the 1935 constitution.
('93', 143, 1, 12, 287179) It is based on provincial autonomy.
('93', 143, 1, 13, 287215) It has the capacity for fullest growth, provided the people are worth it.
('93', 143, 1, 14, 287289) The hill people are with you.
('93', 143, 1, 15, 287319) Many Muslims are also with you.
('93', 143, 1, 16, 287351) The remainder can be, too, if you act on the square.
('93', 143, 1, 17, 287404) You will have to forget petty jealousies and rivalries and overcome your weaknesses.
('93', 143, 1, 18, 287489) Assam has many weaknesses as it has much strength, for I know my Assam.
('93', 143, 2, 19, 287561) ASSAM CONGRESSMEN: With your blessings we can even go outside the Congress and fight.
('93', 143, 3, 20, 287647) GANDHIJI: In 1939, when there was the question of giving up the Ministry, Subhas Babu opposed it as he thought Assams was a special case.
('93', 143, 3, 21, 287785) I told Bardoloi that there was much in what Subhas Babu had said and, although I was the author of that scheme of boycott, I said Assam should not come out if it did not feel like it.
('93', 143, 3, 22, 287969) But Assam did come out; it was wrong.
('93', 143, 4, 23, 288007) The Assam Congressmen said that the Maulana Saheb had then said that exception could not be made in the case of Assam.
('93', 143, 5, 24, 288126) G. Here there is no question of exception.
('93', 143, 5, 25, 288169) Assam rebelled and that civilly.
('93', 143, 5, 26, 288202) But we have that slavish mentality.
('93', 143, 5, 27, 288238) We look to the Congress and then feel that if we do not follow it slavishly, something will go wrong with it.
('93', 143, 5, 28, 288348) I have said that not only a Province but even an individual can rebel against the Congress and by doing so save it, assuming that he is in the right.
('93', 143, 5, 29, 288498) I have done so myself.
('93', 143, 5, 30, 288521) Congress has not attained the present stature without much travail.
('93', 143, 5, 31, 288589) I remember in 1918, I think, there was the Provincial Confer ence of the Congress workers of Gujarat at Ahmedabad.
('93', 143, 5, 32, 288704) The late Abbas Tyabjee was in the chair.
('93', 143, 5, 33, 288745) All the old guards were there.
('93', 143, 5, 34, 288776) The Ali Brothers had not yet joined hands with me fully then, as they did later on.
('93', 143, 5, 35, 288860) The late Shri Vithalbhai Patel was there, and I moved the non co operation resolution.
('93', 143, 5, 36, 288947) I was a nonentity then.
('93', 143, 5, 37, 288971) A constitutional question arose.
('93', 143, 5, 38, 289004) Could a Provincial Conference anticipate the decision
('93', 144, 0, 1, 289058) VOL. 93: 7 NOVEMBER, 1946 16 FEBRUARY, 1947 145
('93', 144, 1, 2, 289106) of the Congress?
('93', 144, 1, 3, 289123) I said, Yes. A Provincial Conference and even a single individual could anticipate the Congress for its own benefit.
('93', 144, 1, 4, 289240) In spite of opposition of the old hands, the resolution was carried.
('93', 144, 1, 5, 289309) That paved the way for the Congress to pass a similar resolution at Calcutta.
('93', 144, 1, 6, 289387) India was dumbfounded at the audacity of a Provincial Conference passing the revolutionary resolution.
('93', 144, 1, 7, 289490) We had formed a Satyagraha Sabha outside the Congress.
('93', 144, 1, 8, 289545) It was joined by Horniman 1, Sarojini Devi 2, Shankarlal 3, Umar Sobhani and Vallabhbhai.
('93', 144, 1, 9, 289635) I was ill.
('93', 144, 1, 10, 289646) The Rowlatt Act was passed.
('93', 144, 1, 11, 289674) I shook with rage.
('93', 144, 1, 12, 289693) I said to the Sardar I could do nothing unless he helped me.
('93', 144, 1, 13, 289754) Sardar was willing.
('93', 144, 1, 14, 289774) And the rest you know.
('93', 144, 1, 15, 289797) It was rebellion, but a healthy one.
('93', 144, 1, 16, 289834) We celebrate the 6th of April to the 13th.
('93', 144, 1, 17, 289877) You have all these historical instances before you.
('93', 144, 1, 18, 289929) I have given you all this time to steel your hearts, to give you courage.
('93', 144, 1, 19, 290003) If you do not act correctly and now, Assam will be finished.
('93', 144, 1, 20, 290064) Tell Bardoloi I do not feel the least uneasiness.
('93', 144, 1, 21, 290114) My mind is made up.
('93', 144, 1, 22, 290134) Assam must not lose its soul.
('93', 144, 1, 23, 290164) It must uphold it against the whole world.
('93', 144, 1, 24, 290207) Else I will say that Assam had only manikins and no men.
('93', 144, 1, 25, 290264) It is an impertinent suggestion that Bengal should dominate Assam in any way.
('93', 144, 2, 26, 290342) Asked if they could tell the people that they had rebelled against the Congress with Gandhijis blessings, Gandhiji said : Talk of Gods blessings.
('93', 144, 2, 27, 290488) They are much richer.
('93', 144, 2, 28, 290510) Tell the people even if Gandhiji tries to dissuade us, we wont listen.

('93', 145, 7, 13, 291698) Now the work for Harijans will shine forth.
('93', 145, 7, 14, 291742) The times are such that everyone must do the greatest penance.

('93', 146, 2, 3, 292754) SRIRAMPUR, December 16, 1946 The chief duty of a servant of a village is purification.
('93', 146, 2, 4, 292841) Today the villages are a festering sore upon the countryside.
('93', 146, 2, 5, 292903) It is no use blaming the British Government for all our ills.
('93', 146, 2, 6, 292965) The latter are going to quit India and we have already got a Government manned 2 by our own people.
('93', 146, 2, 7, 293065) When the British first established themselves firmly in India their idea was to build cities where all rich people would gravitate and help them in exploiting the countryside.
('93', 146, 2, 8, 293241) These cities were made partially beautiful; service of all kinds were made available to their inhabitants while the millions of villagers were left rotting in hopeless ignorance and misery.
('93', 146, 2, 9, 293431) Now that we have a Government manned by our own people let it not be said that they also care for the city people at the expense of the villagers.
('93', 146, 2, 10, 293578) There is a saying in Gujarati: Dawn is whenever one wakes up. Let it be so with us.
('93', 146, 2, 11, 293662) Let the popular Government in the Provinces, whether Congress or League, wake up to the urgency of renovating Indias rural life.
('93', 146, 2, 12, 293791) But this can never be the work of the Government alone; every citizen has to take his due share in public work before we can become a great nation.
('93', 146, 3, 13, 293939) Gandhiji then drew the attention of local workers to the pitiable condition of the villages.
('93', 146, 3, 14, 294032) Clean drinking water was nowhere available, roads were in miserable condition, while the canals were choked up by water hyacinth.
('93', 146, 3, 15, 294162) Every village seemed to have more than its share of dysentery, cholera and smallpox, all of which were preventable diseases.
('93', 146, 3, 16, 294287) There were plenty of men of bad character who took every opportunity of fishing in troubled water for personal gain.
('93', 146, 3, 17, 294404) Purification of this dreadful double disease of mind and body is a task to which workers should address themselves.
('93', 146, 3, 18, 294520) India is not lacking in manpower; what is necessary is collective effort rightly directed.
('93', 146, 3, 19, 294611) Government can do much but they can only do so if there is enlightened public opinion behind them.
('93', 146, 3, 20, 294710) Men are now living like
('93', 146, 4, 21, 294734) 1 The source reported that about a couple of hours before prayer, Gandhiji had addressed a workers meeting and at the end of the prayer the same subject was further continued.

('93', 147, 1, 5, 295212) Harmonious relations will be restored among communities when poverty and ignorance have disappeared.
('93', 147, 1, 6, 295313) It was with that object Gandhiji said that he had come to Noakhali.
('93', 147, 1, 7, 295381) He could not leave the place until his task was done.
('93', 147, 1, 8, 295435) He did not mind laying down his life in that attempt.

('93', 147, 3, 11, 295579) Mahatma Gandhi, making his first reference to the Constituent Assembly, mentioned the resolution 1 moved by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru at the Constituent Assembly defining the objectives which the Constituent Assembly should have.
('93', 147, 3, 12, 295807) Gandhiji said that the resolution was placed by the mover after mature consideration of every aspect of the complicated issue facing the country and with due regard to justice to all communities.
('93', 147, 4, 13, 296003) Gandhiji was sure that Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru would stick to that resolution, whatever be the criticism advanced or opinion held by others.
('93', 147, 5, 14, 296144) Gandhiji also referred to Pandit Nehrus recent visit to London where he had gone and from where he had returned not happily.
('93', 147, 5, 15, 296269) This taught the lesson that we should make our decision after careful deliberation and having full regard to truth and justice and then stick to that decision, whatever the consequences.
('93', 147, 5, 16, 296456) Gandhiji said that he felt that he must stay on here until the situation had completely improved.
('93', 147, 5, 17, 296554) His determination was inflexible, whatever other people might say or feel about it.
('93', 147, 5, 18, 296638) In this connection, Gandhiji cited the story of an artist who had painted a picture.
('93', 147, 5, 19, 296723) The artist placed it at a road corner and invited opinion on his work.
('93', 147, 5, 20, 296794) Later the artist found that his picture had been marked in every place with remarks of disapproval.
('93', 147, 5, 21, 296894) But this, Gandhiji continued, should not be taken by the artist in the light that his work was really not good.
('93', 147, 5, 22, 297006) What one thinks best one should pursue.
('93', 147, 5, 23, 297046) One should know what the wise say and see what the saints practise and then one should search ones own heart whether it wants that thing.
('93', 147, 5, 24, 297184) One should accept immediately what others might say or do.
('93', 147, 5, 25, 297243) One must look to ones own conscience and see if one is prepared for it.
('93', 147, 6, 26, 297315) Therefore, Gandhijis advice to people was not to return to their homes simply because he asked them to do so.
('93', 147, 6, 27, 297425) They should know what the wise men say, what the saints do and also what was in their own mind or heart.

('93', 148, 4, 7, 298057) SRIRAMPUR, December 17, 1946 In my opinion, it will be a grave mistake if the Constituent Assembly attempts, in the face of the boycott by the Muslim League, to frame a constitution for the whole of India.
('93', 148, 4, 8, 298263) If and when the Muslim League boycott becomes an established fact, the Constituent Assembly should have a right to frame a constitution of independence for all the Provinces, States and units that may be represented at the Constituent Assembly.
('93', 148, 4, 9, 298508) This will be an honourable and consistent position for the Constituent Assembly as it is at present constituted.
('93', 148, 4, 10, 298621) There should be no fear of another or for that matter more constituent assemblies sitting, if the attitude advised by me is taken up.
('93', 148, 4, 11, 298755) No other such constituent assembly can sit or function except under the aegis of the British Government whilst the latter functions in India.
('93', 148, 4, 12, 298897) If the British Government wills it, such other constituent assemblies cannot [be] prevented except through a terrible struggle put up by the Congress, whether of a violent or non violent nature.
('93', 148, 4, 13, 299092) I feel too that the Congress can subscribe to the contention of the British Government about Grouping if it allows Assam and the Frontier Province to secede from the Congress for the purposes of the Constituent Assembly.
('93', 148, 4, 14, 299313) The Congress has no power save the moral to compel obedience by a Province or a group such as Sikhs.

('93', 149, 3, 4, 299668) Gandhiji is very anxious on your account, and wishes to learn everything about the present course of treatment, and also if there has been any improvement in your condition.
('93', 149, 4, 5, 299842) He says further that it would not do for you to fall ill like this.
('93', 149, 4, 6, 299910) When one has taken upon himself the responsibility of serving the countrys cause, one has also to master the art of keeping oneself in a workable and healthy condition.
('93', 149, 4, 7, 300079) However heavy the burden of duties may be, the daily routine for maintaining the body in good order must never be broken.

('93', 150, 6, 9, 301746) DEAR ASAF ALI, You are an old and seasoned Congressman.
('93', 150, 6, 10, 301802) I know how you stood in the estimation of the late lamented Hakim Saheb Ajmal Khan and Dr. Ansari and what value Maulana Abul Kalam Azad puts upon you, not to mention the many important Hindu and other friends you have.
('93', 150, 6, 11, 302022) It is well therefore that the Interim Government of India has chosen you as its first Ambassador in America.
('93', 150, 6, 12, 302131) India has a right toexpect you to represent the combined culture Indias many religions represent.
('93', 150, 6, 13, 302229) What is perhaps more, you will represent simple living and high thinking for which the National Congress stands, and of which you are a distinguished member.
('93', 150, 7, 14, 302387) Yours sincerely, M. K. G.

('93', 150, 10, 18, 302492) December 17, 1946
('93', 150, 11, 19, 302510) PYARELAL, I have your strange letter.
('93', 150, 11, 20, 302548) Whatever was important, you have settled while leaving.
('93', 150, 11, 21, 302604) I know I cannot change your decision.
('93', 150, 11, 22, 302642) I am not able to see my mistake.
('93', 150, 11, 23, 302675) If I have made a mistake, it is your duty to point it out to me; and if you cannot do it, that is, if you cannot convince me, then you should follow my rule.
('93', 150, 11, 24, 302833) If you are clear to the last moment, then there is no doubt that you should leave me.
('93', 150, 11, 25, 302919) Now you may act and act quickly in the light of what you consider your duty.
('93', 150, 11, 26, 302996) I have informed you that for me this is my severest test.
('93', 150, 11, 27, 303054) If I do not do or die you must think me worthless.
('93', 150, 11, 28, 303105) Then you may take it that my life is a burden.
('93', 151, 0, 1, 303152) 152 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('93', 151, 1, 2, 303194) You write that my confession was such a heavy punishment for Sushila that compared to that her keeping away without notice should be considered real mercy.
('93', 151, 1, 3, 303350) This I cannot swallow.
('93', 151, 1, 4, 303373) If that is so, then what I did in the case of Ba, my father and many other dear ones should be considered a mistake, is that not so ?
('93', 151, 1, 5, 303507) Surely you do not wish to say that I made a mistake only in this case ?
('93', 151, 1, 6, 303579) You also realize that if I make mistake again and having committed it, do not publicly correct it, there is no hope of success in my present work.
('93', 151, 1, 7, 303726) Hence, I can do nothing else.
('93', 151, 1, 8, 303756) Though I may make a mistake and proclaim it to the world, yet the heaviest punishment is borne by one at whose cost the mistake is made !
('93', 151, 1, 9, 303894) How can that be so ?
('93', 151, 1, 10, 303915) Is there not something very wrong in this line of thinking ?
('93', 151, 1, 11, 303976) Suppose that A who is innocent is assaulted and abused by B. Then B repents and makes a public apology.
('93', 151, 1, 12, 304080) In thus purifying himself B will have proved guilty and yet A will suffer, is that so?
('93', 151, 1, 13, 304167) That As love may cause anguish to him is an other matter.
('93', 151, 1, 14, 304225) Such anguish is only for the good.
('93', 151, 1, 15, 304260) If you consider Bs confession proper, there is no difference between him and me.
('93', 151, 1, 16, 304341) Even if A is not innocent, B, who adheres to non violence will not be proved innocent because by his own yardstick he has definitely been guilty.
('93', 151, 1, 17, 304487) And anyone who has accepted my moral standard will say that it would be only proper that A also makes a public confession of his guilt.
('93', 151, 1, 18, 304623) Now, in deference to both of you, I have taken the only course possible for me.
('93', 151, 1, 19, 304703) I have not mentioned anything in the diary.
('93', 151, 1, 20, 304747) I do not give as much importance to my diary as you do.
('93', 151, 1, 21, 304803) Sushila of course insists that everything may as well be known to the public.
('93', 151, 1, 22, 304881) But here insistence has no value because she says it out of anguish.
('93', 151, 1, 23, 304950) She does not regard it as a duty.
('93', 151, 1, 24, 304984) That is why I have not sent the note I had written to Nirmal Babu.
('93', 151, 1, 25, 305051) I have torn it up.
('93', 151, 1, 26, 305070) I have written to Sushila that her duty is to follow your advice; when you and I say different things, in my opinion she should do what you say.
('93', 151, 1, 27, 305215) Now I have said everything that needs to be said.
('93', 151, 1, 28, 305265) You may do what you consider proper.
('93', 151, 1, 29, 305302) Sushila is very deeply wounded.
('93', 151, 1, 30, 305334) I have tried my utmost to pacify her.
('93', 151, 1, 31, 305372) It may be good if you remain with her for the time being.
('93', 151, 1, 32, 305430) I wish you would go to the village and stay with her.
('93', 151, 1, 33, 305484) Both of you should together consider and decide what your duty is.
('93', 151, 1, 34, 305551) The task this

('93', 152, 1, 2, 305613) time is extremely delicate.
('93', 152, 1, 3, 305641) I have written all this after careful deliberation.
('93', 152, 1, 4, 305693) This is the first thing I did after the morning prayer.
('93', 152, 1, 5, 305749) Before this I wrote a postcard about Sriramulu and the first few sentences in the diary.
('93', 152, 1, 6, 305838) I must keep a copy of this, but probably you will not wish it copied in the diary.
('93', 152, 1, 7, 305921) So you may return this to me or a copy of it.
('93', 152, 2, 8, 305967) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] I have sent replies to Asaf Alis questions.

('93', 152, 5, 16, 306321) What shall I say to you?
('93', 152, 5, 17, 306346) I have already said that you do not understand me and still call me your guide.
('93', 152, 5, 18, 306426) You caused pain to Kanu also.
('93', 152, 5, 19, 306456) Now what shall I say?
('93', 152, 5, 20, 306478) It is a crime even to talk to you.
('93', 152, 5, 21, 306513) I shall be satisfied if you act according to what you have gained and be happy.
('93', 152, 5, 22, 306593) I am afraid to talk to you about anything.
('93', 152, 5, 23, 306636) You misinterpreted what I told you with great affection and caused pain to Kanu by giving him your interpretation.
('93', 152, 5, 24, 306751) Neither you nor I will lose anything if you do not come here.

('93', 153, 1, 2, 307160) that place 1 to hold his prayers.
('93', 153, 1, 3, 307194) God willing, he would like to tour such affected villages one by one.
('93', 153, 1, 4, 307264) He had not the strength in him to undertake that big task now.
('93', 153, 1, 5, 307327) For that strength he depended on God.
('93', 153, 1, 6, 307365) He would like to hold his prayers wherever he goes during his village to village tour.
('93', 153, 2, 7, 307452) Explaining further the object of his present mission, Gandhiji said that the task of rehabilitation of refugees had still to be undertaken and it remained an uphill one.
('93', 153, 2, 8, 307622) He was glad that volunteers from far off places were coming forward to lend a helping hand and mentioned Sardar Niranjan Singh Gill and Sardar Jivan Singh, both of Azad Hind Fouj, who had met and expressed their desire to place their services at his disposal.
('93', 153, 2, 9, 307882) Gandhiji said that both had met the Bengal Premier before coming to Noakhali and had been promised full support in their mission of assisting speedy rehabilitation.
('93', 153, 3, 10, 308047) Introducing Sardar Jivan Singh to the prayer audience, Gandhiji said that detailed plans of their work had been worked out by Sardars Jivan Singh and Niranjan Singh Gill and would be placed before Bengal Premier.
('93', 153, 3, 11, 308260) Gandhiji was glad that members of the small Sikh community in far off Punjab considered that the problem facing East Bengal was an all India problem and that no part of the country could afford to remain indifferent to happenings in other parts.
('93', 153, 3, 12, 308506) This was a correct example which every one should emulate.
('93', 153, 3, 13, 308565) Gandhiji was particularly glad that these bold Sikh soldiers who joined the Azad Hind Fouj and fought had now come without even their kirpans 3 to work non violently for the promotion of communal harmony.
('93', 153, 3, 14, 308770) This perhaps explained the futility of violence in contrast to the efficacy and potentiality of non violence.
('93', 153, 4, 15, 308880) Introducing Mr. Asaf Ali, Member of the Interim Government, to the prayer
('93', 153, 5, 16, 308954) gathering, Gandhiji observed : We are on the threshold of freedom.
('93', 153, 5, 17, 309021) But we must not forget that we have not yet attained full freedom.
('93', 153, 6, 18, 309088) Gandhiji said that the Interim Government thought it desirable to have a representative in America for the purpose of interpreting India to the American people and Mr. Asaf Ali had been chosen to hold that high office and fulfil the mission entrusted to him.
('93', 153, 6, 19, 309347) Referring to the Railway Portfolio now held by Mr. Asaf Ali, Gandhiji said that the immediate problem which should engage the serious attention of the Railway Member was to improve travelling facilities for the third

('93', 154, 2, 3, 310003) Gandhiji then referred to his anger which had overcome him on Mon day night.
('93', 154, 2, 4, 310080) 2 He did not have even proper rest that night, but from half past two at night he began his work.
('93', 154, 2, 5, 310178) In this connection Gandhiji related how once his father was angry when Gandhiji went to see a theatre.
('93', 154, 2, 6, 310281) But his angry father did not say anything to him.
('93', 154, 2, 7, 310331) Instead, he (his father) began to weep and beat his head.
('93', 154, 2, 8, 310389) Similarly, he at the time of his anger that night began to beat his own head.
('93', 154, 2, 9, 310467) But he did not like to weep like others.
('93', 154, 2, 10, 310508) Instead he wanted to unburden his heavy heart by placing before the whole world what mistake he had committed by being angry.
('93', 154, 2, 11, 310634) For he knew that a man of ahimsa like him should not be angry.
('93', 154, 2, 12, 310697) But he tried his best to suppress his own anger, but so far he had not completely succeeded.
('93', 154, 2, 13, 310790) He said : 3
('93', 154, 3, 14, 310802) I am not a Mahatma; I am an alpatma.
('93', 154, 3, 15, 310839) I am an ordinary mortal like you all and I am strenuously trying to practise ahimsa.
('93', 154, 3, 16, 310924) Today I lost my temper and, therefore, I am not a perfect man.
('93', 154, 3, 17, 310987) If an imperfect man like me can try to practise ahimsa, all of you also can do so.
('93', 154, 3, 18, 311070) I have come here with the determination to put my ahimsa to test and in that process either succeed or perish.
('93', 154, 4, 19, 311181) He said that every personal act had to be dominated by truth and non violence if they were to be evidenced in big things.
('93', 154, 4, 20, 311303) These were not wooden things but living organisms.
('93', 154, 4, 21, 311354) He felt that he had not attained the necessary stage of detachment described in the Gita.
('93', 154, 5, 22, 311444) He asked his hearers to discard the thought that what one man could do was not possible for all human beings even if a persistent attempt was made.
('93', 154, 5, 23, 311592) It was simple wisdom to remember that mans vocation was to make the attempt and Gods grace alone could bless it with success.

('93', 154, 7, 27, 311997) suddenly all of us heard a deeply anguished cry .
('93', 154, 7, 28, 312047) It was Gandhijis voice, and then we heard the sound of two slaps .
('93', 154, 7, 29, 312114) then a heavy sob. On December 20, Gandhiji explained to N. K. Bose : When she learnt about my proposed journey by foot, she was insistent that some old companion who knew about my personal requirements should be in my company .

('93', 156, 3, 8, 314604) Well, I am in an out of the way village hamlet where many dwellings have been burnt down and the contents looted.
('93', 156, 3, 9, 314718) I have deprived myself of secretarial assistance.
('93', 156, 3, 10, 314768) I have a Bengali professor who has elected to become my interpreter and teacher and even gives me massage, etc.
('93', 156, 3, 11, 314880) Parasuram of Malabar is with me by accident, and as he came to me as an expert short hand writer and typist I make occasional use of him for taking down letters such as this.
('93', 156, 3, 12, 315055) But generally he is in the charge of everything pertaining to my personal wants and I am sorry to confess that this business is so taxing and exacting that it takes the bulk of his time.
('93', 156, 3, 13, 315242) But he is an uncomplaining, tireless worker, and as he had not had the opportunity of coming in personal touch with me during the two years he has been with me, he loves the work that he is doing now and I love him.
('93', 156, 3, 14, 315458) Other fellow workers have been distributed at the peril of their lives in various burnt and looted villages in the attempt to bring the two warring elements together and bring, if human effort can, peace to this unhappy portion of India.
('93', 156, 3, 15, 315696) I confess that it is not the only unhappy portion of India, but Destiny chose it for putting me or rather my ahimsa and truth on their trial and here am I undergoing that stiff but self imposed test.
('93', 156, 3, 16, 315896) Therefore, you see that either I must myself wade through your papers or neglect them for the time being.
('93', 156, 3, 17, 316002) But I dare not take the second course for the reason that I invited the task, and I must not complain.
('93', 156, 3, 18, 316105) I am half through the long documents.
('93', 156, 3, 19, 316143) It is deeply human and interesting and for the love I have towards you I will like to give much more than cursory attention to the papers you have prepared with such

('93', 160, 6, 8, 321141) 4. He wished that the correspondents should make independent observation in the surrounding villages and try to find out if evacuees were returning home or not, and what was the effect of Gandhijis presence on Muslim villagers.

('93', 160, 9, 11, 321421) SRIRAMPUR, December 19, 1946 1. As to the National Flag, my opinion is that whilst we are part of the British Dominions it is but right and proper that in the Ambassadors office in America the Union Jack is flown side by side with the National Flag.
('93', 160, 9, 12, 321671) In view of the Muslim League revolt, I would go so far as to question the prudence of flying in America the Congress flag as our National Flag.
('93', 160, 9, 13, 321815) But it is a ticklish question and you should ask, on this and the other questions, for the instructions of the Interim Government, not merely of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.
('93', 160, 9, 14, 321985) Every Ambassador carries written instructions within which he is bound to act.
('93', 160, 9, 15, 322064) These he can neither diminish nor extend.
('93', 160, 9, 16, 322106) 2. As to the second, India as she is at present cannot omit the Union Jack in foreign countries.
('93', 160, 9, 17, 322203) Take instructions.
('93', 160, 9, 18, 322222) 3. As to the third, there is a new British National Anthem, omitting all the objectionable words.
('93', 160, 9, 19, 322320) I have no doubt that what was

('93', 160, 10, 21, 322433) The news had gone round that he was about to begin to tour on foot through the affected villages of Noakhali and Tippera, and therefore several Press representatives and photographers arrived.
('93', 160, 10, 22, 322626) I met them in a private conference and communicated to them the following instructions from Gandhiji. 2 The questions were asked by Asaf Ali, who had been appointed Ambassador to the U.S.A. and were sent through Pyarelal; vide Talk with Satis Chandra Das Gupta, 7 1 1947

('93', 161, 1, 3, 323025) Whether we can sing Vandemataram or Jai Hind or the Tricolour song at the same time should be decided by the Interim Government.
('93', 161, 1, 4, 323154) 4. The Ambassadors speeches where audiences are purely or predominatly Indian should be in Hindustani first and he can translate the same into English whenever occasion requires it.
('93', 161, 1, 5, 323336) For pure American audiences speeches should be only in English.
('93', 161, 1, 6, 323400) It would be pompous and unreal to deliver before American audiences speeches first in Hindustani and then translations in English.
('93', 161, 1, 7, 323531) It should be remembered that the most polished Ambassadors have read their speeches which they have prepared or have been prepared for them in advance.

('93', 161, 5, 12, 323809) DEAR FRIEND, I wrote to you three lettersone dated 3 12 46 1 on the general situation, a second dated 4 12 46 regarding Sardar Bahadur Sir Datar Singhs suggestion and a third in reply to your letters of 2nd and 3rd December.
('93', 161, 5, 13, 324034) 2 I am sorry that all the letters have remained unanswered.
('93', 161, 5, 14, 324094) I can only ascribe to heavy pressure on you the absence of any communication from you.
('93', 161, 5, 15, 324181) I took the liberty of sending to Abdulla Saheb three complaints which had come under my noticeone of very recent murder, another of rape and third of loot.
('93', 161, 5, 16, 324337) He was good enough to call on me yesterday and to tell me the result of his investigation which he was good enough to hold very promptly.
('93', 161, 5, 17, 324475) The first one he said was true as to the event itself but not sustained about the culprits named.
('93', 161, 5, 18, 324573) I believe the guilty parties are being traced.
('93', 161, 5, 19, 324620) The second has been found by him to be a concoction.
('93', 161, 5, 20, 324673) The third is found to be true and is being pursued.

('93', 162, 1, 2, 324892) For me the relevance for the purpose of this letter lies in the fact that the trouble is not over and the fear is not wholly without foundation.
('93', 162, 1, 3, 325037) Indeed, complaints have been almost daily coming to me showing how difficult the problem is.
('93', 162, 1, 4, 325130) If you can possibly regard me as a well wisher of your Ministry and of the Muslim League, you will please continue as you began to let at least one Minister to be on the spot and keep himself in touch with me.
('93', 162, 1, 5, 325340) If this expectation is too great or cannot be fulfilled, you will please tell me whether you approve of my keeping in touch with the District Magistrate and the Superintendent of Police to whom I could directly refer the matters which come under my notice and which I consider to be worthy of being put before them.
('93', 162, 2, 6, 325656) Yours sincerely, M. K. GANDHI [PS.] Just as I was about to sign this, two messengers from Comilla came in and handed me your letter.

('93', 162, 6, 15, 326142) It seems to have been given to me on the 16th.
('93', 162, 6, 16, 326189) I have been meaning to reply to it every day since then, but could manage to dictate this only now at 5.15 (local time) after the morning prayer.
('93', 162, 6, 17, 326335) I am so helpless at present.
('93', 162, 6, 18, 326364) I am dictating this to Manu who arrived from Mahuwa yesterday.
('93', 162, 6, 19, 326427) I wished to write the letter myself, but could not do that.
('93', 162, 6, 20, 326487) I have been awake since 2.30 this morning.
('93', 162, 6, 21, 326530) I have, therefore, been dictating letters lying in bed.

('93', 163, 0, 1, 326755) 164 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('93', 163, 1, 2, 326797) asion, to join the new University 1. By all means do so.
('93', 163, 1, 3, 326854) I have no doubt at all that you will adorn whatever work you take up.
('93', 163, 1, 4, 326924) But I will blame you if there is the slightest slackening in Hindustani work.
('93', 163, 1, 5, 327002) I will not then accept the reply that you joined the University with my consent.
('93', 163, 1, 6, 327083) I should like you to join the University with this understanding.
('93', 163, 1, 7, 327149) But you must know that your headquarters will necessarily be at Wardha.
('93', 163, 1, 8, 327221) You should also tell Mavalankar that Sardar and other Gujaratis should agree to your joining the University.
('93', 163, 1, 9, 327330) It will be enough if you inform him to that effect.
('93', 163, 1, 10, 327382) Your shield will be Dada 2. I could not follow your definition of residential.
('93', 163, 1, 11, 327461) I have understood the word merely to mean that colleges and other institutions outside the University area should not be placed within its jurisdiction.
('93', 163, 1, 12, 327614) For instance, the Aligarh University.
('93', 163, 1, 13, 327652) Any student may join such a university, but there will be no affiliated colleges.
('93', 163, 1, 14, 327734) Why does Dada insist that the Committee should have only Gujaratis as members?
('93', 163, 1, 15, 327813) You are regarded as a Gujarati, and so is Mavalankar.
('93', 163, 1, 16, 327867) But suppose it were not so; according to me it would be narrowmindedness then, if, on that ground, you could not be elected.
('93', 163, 1, 17, 327992) If the U. P. or Bihar were to reject Kripalani as being a Sindhi, would it not be an illustration of the dog in the manger attitude?
('93', 163, 1, 18, 328125) One cannot oneself eat but would not let others eat.
('93', 163, 1, 19, 328178) If, therefore, it is considered necessary to add a fifth qualification to the fourth mentioned, I would suggest this: Nobody will be appointed a member of this Committee merely because of his status or to please him, though any such person who possesses the other qualifications for passing the test will be accepted.
('93', 163, 1, 20, 328496) I understand about Narahari and Kishorelal.
('93', 163, 1, 21, 328540) See that the latter does nothing at the cost of his health.
('93', 163, 1, 22, 328600) I would describe my health as excellent.
('93', 163, 1, 23, 328641) The climate here wholly agrees with me.
('93', 163, 1, 24, 328681) Bisen 3 is working with Satis Babu.
('93', 163, 1, 25, 328717) The latter had sent him today to me for my final decision.
('93', 163, 1, 26, 328776) I had a long and frank talk with him.
('93', 163, 1, 27, 328814) I have also understood what kind of a man he is.

('93', 164, 2, 4, 329346) Dont hide even a single thought from me.
('93', 164, 2, 5, 329387) give a true answer to whatever I ask.

('93', 164, 2, 7, 329486) Give me in writing what effect it had on your mind.
('93', 164, 2, 8, 329538) I shall certainly reveal all my thoughts to you.
('93', 164, 2, 9, 329587) But this much I want at the moment.
('93', 164, 2, 10, 329623) Have it engraved in your heart that whatever I ask or say will be solely for your good.
('93', 164, 2, 11, 329711) If it is so indeed, 1 I shall have to ask for nothing more.
('93', 164, 2, 12, 329771) I shall only have to understand it.

('93', 165, 6, 10, 331240) December 20, 1946
('93', 165, 7, 11, 331258) As soon as the French gentleman entered the room Gandhiji greeted him in French Comment allez vous? 3 And then added with a loud laughter that he had exhausted his entire stock of French !
('93', 165, 8, 12, 331447) The visitor was surprised and was all smiles on hearing Gandhiji greeting him in French.
('93', 165, 9, 13, 331536) Gandhiji then told him that he had learnt some French in his school days.
('93', 165, 9, 14, 331610) Gandhiji then referred to Victor Hugo and said that he could still picture before his mind Jean Valjean crawling through the lanes of Paris.
('93', 165, 10, 15, 331751) Gandhiji then told Cartier that he had been to Paris thrice and had on every occasion wanted to stay in the quarters inhabited by the poor.
('93', 165, 10, 16, 331891) It was surprising, he said, that the first city of the world in regard to fashion, luxury and certain other things should have miserable slums lying in the heart of the city.
('93', 165, 11, 17, 332066) On being asked by Cartier as to what Gandhiji thought about the present condition of Europe, Gandhiji said that people of Europe were talking of peace but harboured war in their hearts.
('93', 165, 11, 18, 332252) Unless they shed violence from their hearts, it was not possible for them to have peace.
('93', 165, 12, 19, 332341) 1The subscription is in Gujarati.
('93', 165, 12, 20, 332375) 2 The Sunday Hindustan Standard reported that the interviewer, editor of three French Newspapers, Matin, Samed Soir and Excelsior, was on a world tour.
('93', 165, 12, 21, 332527) He arrived in the afternoon when Gandhiji was taking nature cure treatment with an earth bandage on forehead and eyes closed.
('93', 165, 12, 22, 332653) 3 How do you do?
('93', 165, 12, 23, 332670) 4 This sentence is reproduced from Mahatma GandhiThe Last Phase.
('93', 166, 0, 1, 332735) VOL. 93: 7 NOVEMBER, 1946 16 FEBRUARY, 1947 167
('93', 166, 1, 2, 332783) When the last war began, Gandhiji said, he had felt that unless Europe changed its ways this war would only be a prelude to a third and more disastrous war.
('93', 166, 2, 3, 332940) Raymond Cartier asked: We who are children of violence in Europe, how do you expect us to become non violent?
('93', 166, 3, 4, 333050) In reply, Gandhiji said that if they continued like this, they were sure to perish.
('93', 166, 3, 5, 333134) What had happened in Europe was that Hitlerism had only been destroyed by super Hitlerism and this chain was endless.
('93', 166, 3, 6, 333252) It would go on like that.
('93', 166, 4, 7, 333278) Raymond Cartier asked if the remedy lay in a new form of education.
('93', 166, 5, 8, 333346) Gandhiji said that education must be of a new type for the sake of the creation of a new world.
('93', 166, 5, 9, 333442) He referred to Aldous Huxley 2, who, he observed, represented a new type of thought which was working in the mind of Europe today.
('93', 166, 5, 10, 333573) It might be in a minority today but if Europe was to save itself from suicide, something along the lines of non violence had to be adopted.
('93', 166, 6, 11, 333713) Asked as to how it would be possible to destroy Hitlerism by non violence, Gandhiji said that was what we had to find out.
('93', 166, 6, 12, 333836) Otherwise, if one depended upon superior violence in order to destroy violence of the Hitlerism type, then small nations would have hardly any chance of survival.
('93', 166, 6, 13, 333999) It was only when a nation individually refused to be beaten by Hitlerism or any combination of forces of violence, and stuck to its post at the cost of its life, but not at the cost of its honour, that it had a chance of survival.
('93', 166, 6, 14, 334230) So, non violence was the only guarantee of protection against the heaviest odds.
('93', 166, 6, 15, 334311) Unless we could develop this courage and this type of resistance, democracy could never survive.
('93', 166, 7, 16, 334408) Cartier next asked, how France could have at all survived if it had not defended itself against the Nazi hordes.
('93', 166, 8, 17, 334521) Gandhiji replied that for that matter even the Maginot Line had not availed them much.
('93', 166, 8, 18, 334608) Hitler had reduced it to nothingness.
('93', 166, 9, 19, 334646) Cartier said that the fault lay not in the principle; it was a technical flaw in the Maginot Line to which military strategists attributed its collapse.
('93', 166, 9, 20, 334799) Gandhiji rejoined : Maybe; but beyond that there is a deeper flaw which is funda mental to the whole philosophy of the Maginot Line.
('93', 166, 9, 21, 334932) Unless you can better Hitler in violence, you cannot gain victory.
('93', 166, 9, 22, 334999) But the moment you

('93', 167, 1, 2, 335410) do that, it is Hitlerism that wins and the whole plan of eradicating violence by superior violence is reduced to futility.
('93', 167, 1, 3, 335533) It is by non violence alone that you can vanquish Hitlerism or any other species of violence.
('93', 167, 1, 4, 335627) If I were a Parisian and the Germans invaded my city, I would stir up the Parisians, so that they would lay down their lives to the last man in the defence of their city, not as they did in the last war, but by showing that higher type of courage which the conquest of violence by non violence calls for.
('93', 167, 1, 5, 335932) That is what I am trying to evolve in Noakhali.
('93', 167, 1, 6, 335980) How far I shall succeed, I do not know.
('93', 167, 2, 7, 336020) Lastly, Gandhiji again referred to the works of Victor Hugo and to two of his books, namely, Les Miserables and Ninety three and recalled the story of the clergymans son who represented the type of courage to which Gandhiji was referring.

('93', 167, 4, 12, 336516) Told her to have a talk with Jaisukhlal.
('93', 167, 4, 13, 336557) She could still change her mind, but once having taken the plunge she would have to run the risks.
('93', 167, 4, 14, 336656) She remained steadfast.
('93', 167, 4, 15, 336680) 1 For my sake she would have a talk with Jaisukhlal.
('93', 167, 4, 16, 336733) But he had left everything to her and would do so in future too.

('93', 168, 1, 6, 337611) It is possible that that relation is perfectly pure.
('93', 168, 1, 7, 337664) But the father at any rate must be informed, and his consent obtained.

('93', 168, 1, 9, 337761) We may do whatever is possible for Sharda and then stop worrying.

('93', 168, 1, 14, 338012) I am being tested.
('93', 168, 1, 15, 338031) Is the weapon of satyagraha of my conception really a weapon of the strong or only of the weak?
('93', 168, 1, 16, 338127) It is, therefore, my firm resolve to accomplish my mission here or to lay down my life in the attempt.

('93', 169, 5, 22, 340558) Possibly it was lost.
('93', 169, 5, 23, 340580) It does happen to some of my letters.
('93', 169, 5, 24, 340618) I have received a copy of the Bihar Provincial [Muslim] Leagues report.
('93', 169, 5, 25, 340690) You too must have received a copy.

('93', 170, 6, 13, 342091) Gandhiji began by saying that he held very strong views on the question of charity.
('93', 170, 6, 14, 342175) It was wrong both to accept as well as to offer anyone a free gift.
('93', 170, 6, 15, 342243) In our land irreligion often masqueraded in the name of religion.
('93', 170, 6, 16, 342309) India was said to have a contingent of 56 lakhs of religious mendicants, not many of whom could be considered worthy in any sense.
('93', 170, 6, 17, 342440) Even the hateful custom of untouchability had been given sanction of religion in this land of sorrow.
('93', 170, 7, 18, 342542) The problem of relief and rehabilitation, Gandhiji went to say, had become a serious one.
('93', 170, 7, 19, 342632) People from all over India were eager to help the afflicted inhabitants of Noakhali with money or free gifts of all kinds, and there was a chance that the latter might slip into a mentality of willing dependence on public charity.
('93', 170, 7, 20, 342863) This had to be combated as much as the complacence of those who might feel they were acquiring religious merit through charitable gifts.
('93', 170, 8, 21, 343000) Referring to the attitude which the Government should exercise with regard to the refugees in comparison with that held by public charitable bodies, Gandhiji proceeded to explain that it was true that people had gathered in the refugee camps for no fault of theirs.
('93', 170, 8, 22, 343266) Their homes had been burnt and they were without shelter; others had been robbed of all their belongings although their cottages might still be standing, while a third group had deserted their homes mainly from a feeling of insecurity.
('93', 170, 8, 23, 343502) It should be the object of the Government to deal with each case on its merits and help the people to return home with a feeling of security.

('93', 171, 1, 2, 343719) Before necessary conditions were created, it would not be right for the authorities to stop rations unless the evacuees went back home with their whole families.
('93', 171, 1, 3, 343881) If the evacuees were expected to brave hardships and perhaps even death in order to reinstate themselves in their homes, then there would be no need of a state; it would be a condition of enlightened anarchy where every man would be able to protect himself by his own strength in the face of the greatest danger.
('93', 171, 1, 4, 344194) But as things stood today, much of the necessary work of social service had to be conducted by Governmental organizations.
('93', 171, 2, 5, 344317) Adequate protection had to be given and an atmosphere created where the people might once more pursue their lifes work in peace.
('93', 171, 2, 6, 344446) So long as the conditions were not forthcoming, arrangements for relief had to continue.
('93', 171, 3, 7, 344535) But the case of public charitable societies stood on an entirely different footing.
('93', 171, 3, 8, 344619) Gandhiji held it was wrong for any man to live on public doles.
('93', 171, 3, 9, 344683) While the South African satyagraha was going on, large sums of money were donated to cover the expenses of the satyagrahis.
('93', 171, 3, 10, 344807) The Tolstoy Farm near Lawley in the Transvaal was established to accommodate the families and dependents of satyagrahis who worked to the best of their ability for their upkeep.
('93', 171, 3, 11, 344985) Consequently, the satyagraha organization was able to refund large sums of money at the end of the campaign.
('93', 171, 4, 12, 345094) In accordance with the same principles, the charitable institutions now working here should plainly tell the people that everyone should deem it a dishonour to eat a single meal without honest labour.
('93', 171, 4, 13, 345295) If we could shed the aversion to labour and adapt ourselves to unexpected changes of fortune, we would go a long way towards the acquisition of fearlessness and thus towards an upliftment of our national character.
('93', 171, 5, 14, 345510) He would venture to tell the refugees that whether they were poor or rich, they should say to the authorities that they would consider it below human dignity to accept doles from the Government.
('93', 171, 5, 15, 345705) Poor or rich had nothing left to them.
('93', 171, 5, 16, 345744) Therefore, they were in need of food, clothing, shelter and medical assistance.
('93', 171, 5, 17, 345824) Therefore, they had a claim upon the State for providing these vital necessities of life.
('93', 171, 5, 18, 345914) But they would be robbing society if they accepted this aid without each healthy man, woman, boy or girl, labouring to the extent of his or her ability and therefore he would like the Government to provide such useful work for society which they were capable of doing.

('93', 172, 4, 14, 346967) I am glad that those Hindus who had left their home are returning.
('93', 172, 4, 15, 347034) I hope that the Muslims there will reassure the Hindu brothers and sisters; those who are guilty will confess their guilt and all will live together amicably.
('93', 172, 4, 16, 347193) I hope Hindus will eradicate untouchability.

('93', 172, 8, 21, 347383) SRIRAMPUR, NOAKHALI, DISTT., December 22, 1946
('93', 172, 9, 22, 347430) DEAR FRIEND, I sent you yesterday by way of postscript a mere ackn owledgment of your letter of 15th instant which came in as mine was going for despatch.
('93', 172, 9, 23, 347585) I observe that Bihar is still on your brain and that
('93', 172, 10, 24, 347638) 1 This was sent on the occasion of an inter caste dinner which Gandhiji could not himself attend.
('93', 172, 10, 25, 347736) The message was sent through Amrita Lal Chatterjee who was in charge of the Gandhi Peace Mission Centre for the relief and rehabilitation of the riot affected Hindus and re establishment of peace and concord between the two communities spread over some forty villages.
('93', 173, 0, 1, 348005) 174 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('93', 173, 1, 2, 348047) you are evidently so worried by the many cares of office that you have not taken the trouble to read my letter carefully, for you have quoted me from memory which has proved a false friend even to men of genius rightly proud of their memory.
('93', 173, 1, 3, 348289) If you dont mind, let me assist you by quoting the relevant portion from my letter of 5th instant referred to by you.
('93', 173, 1, 4, 348407) If I find any confirmation of the most serious statements made by you about Bihar, I confess that I have egregiously blundered by resuming normal diet.
('93', 173, 1, 5, 348559) But I am loath to reject the testimony of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, then of Dr. Rajendra Prasad, both responsible men and persons who had gone specially for the purpose of seeing things for themselves and allaying mob fury.
('93', 173, 1, 6, 348782) They admit that the behaviour of the Hindu crowds was bad enough in all consience but they do not bear out the statements made in your letter nor do they uphold the figures given by you.
('93', 173, 1, 7, 348969) They also tell me that mob fury has subsided and that the Government have regained control undoubtedly with the assistance of the military.
('93', 173, 1, 8, 349109) If I could feel that my presence was at all necessary in Bihar, I assure you that I would not need any encouragement from you to do so.
('93', 173, 1, 9, 349245) On the contrary, my informants assure me that my presence is not required in Bihar.
('93', 173, 1, 10, 349329) In these circumstances, unless I feel sure of my ground, I know that I must not go to Bihar.
('93', 173, 1, 11, 349422) But I would like to make the assurance doubly sure and with that end in view I would be glad to get your permission to send copies of your letters to the Prime Minsiter of Bihar and know his reaction.
('93', 173, 1, 12, 349623) There too you will pardon me, will you not, for not taking your statements as gospel truth.
('93', 173, 1, 13, 349715) For one thing, you have no first hand knowledge of events.
('93', 173, 1, 14, 349774) I suggest that there should be impartial commission, appointed with the consent of the two Govern ments, to go into the distrubances both in Noakhali and Bihar.
('93', 173, 1, 15, 349935) If your statements are true and the callous behaviour of the Bihar Government, which you so graphically describe, can be sustained, it is a bad day for the Bihar Government, a bad day for Hindus and good bye to restoration of friendly relations between the two communities, and it would be a serious question for me to consider where I stand.
('93', 173, 1, 16, 350278) The least I can permit myself to say is that then I should have no hesitation in publicly denouncing the Bihar Ministers and Bihar Hindus.
('93', 173, 1, 17, 350417) I would plead with you to suspend, if you at all can, final judgment in
('93', 174, 0, 1, 350489) VOL. 93: 7 NOVEMBER, 1946 16 FEBRUARY, 1947 175
('93', 174, 1, 2, 350537) the matter.
('93', 174, 1, 3, 350549) To this, which I hold is a full and frank statement of my position, you were good enough to reply :
('93', 174, 2, 4, 350649) I was a little bit taken aback to read in your letter that having heard something from Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Babu Rajendra Prasad you thought that nothing had taken place in Bihar to justify your presence there.
('93', 174, 2, 5, 350867) I hope that the juxtaposition of the two quotations is enough to demonstrate to you the wholly unwarranted inference drawn by you.
('93', 174, 2, 6, 350998) But if you still maintain in the correctness of your inference I shall gladly endeavour to demonstrate the unwarranted nature of your inference.
('93', 174, 2, 7, 351143) Further, you say :
('93', 174, 3, 8, 351162) I do not know .
('93', 174, 3, 9, 351178) whether they said that there had been no murders, loot, massacre, rape, abduction, conversion or cruelties of unimaginable bestiality and brutishness.
('93', 174, 3, 10, 351329) I suppose, in support of this charge you have the report issued by the Bihar Provincial Muslim League, of which you have been good enough to send me a copy.
('93', 174, 3, 11, 351486) In parenthesis, I may say that no other copy was received or seen by me.
('93', 174, 3, 12, 351559) Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Dr. Rajendra Prasad admit loot and massacre but they do not admit rape, abduction and conversion in Bihar and if unimaginable bestiality and brutishness are used to convey more than has been conveyed by the words preceding, I would like you to instruct me as to the exact implication of the phrase.
('93', 174, 3, 13, 351886) I had a visit only the other day from Pandit Dhanraj Sharma, M.L.A. (Bihar Congress).
('93', 174, 3, 14, 351972) I try to get as much information as I can from those who come to me from Bihar.
('93', 174, 3, 15, 352052) Perhaps, it will interest you to know what he had to say about the charges such as have been made in the Bihar report referred to above.
('93', 174, 3, 16, 352189) I have read the main parts of that report and I must confess that it is not a balanced document.
('93', 174, 3, 17, 352286) Its framers have failed to convince the reader of a fair measure of impartiality.
('93', 174, 3, 18, 352368) Be that as it may, it carries no conviction to me and is in flat contradiction to what all my informants have given me including Pandit Dhanraj, a copy of whose letter I am sending you.
('93', 174, 3, 19, 352554) The Bihar report confirms the suggestion I have made to you for the appointment of an impartial commission of inquiry.
('93', 174, 3, 20, 352673) To this suggestion of mine, you have omitted to make any reply.
('93', 174, 3, 21, 352737) Now that I have got a copy of the report of the Bihar Provincial .
('93', 174, 4, 22, 352804) suggest to them the appointement of such a commission.
('93', 174, 4, 23, 352859) I shall

('93', 175, 0, 1, 352899) 176 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('93', 175, 1, 2, 352941) certainly tell you of the result.
('93', 175, 1, 3, 352975) You proceed to say :
('93', 175, 2, 4, 352996) It is true that it is the Muslims who have suffered in Bihar and not Hindus.
('93', 175, 2, 5, 353073) And then you insinuate,
('93', 175, 3, 6, 353097) therefore, perhaps, your going to Bihar will not have any effect in re establishing confidence amongst Muslims but the problems are by no means dissimilar.
('93', 175, 3, 7, 353253) Let me say that I do not regard the Muslims to have less claim on my service or attention.
('93', 175, 3, 8, 353344) However, I admit that my going to Bihar for the time being will fail to re establish confidence amongst Muslims.
('93', 175, 3, 9, 353457) I must not go into the causes at this stage.
('93', 175, 3, 10, 353502) I cannot help deploring the fact.
('93', 175, 3, 11, 353536) This distrust is so utterly baseless.
('93', 175, 3, 12, 353574) I regard myself as an efficient servant of India.
('93', 175, 3, 13, 353624) Let me tell you, whether you as a late friend and other members of the Muslims League believe me or not, that I am here to regain the lost confidence.
('93', 175, 3, 14, 353775) Nothing will move me away from Noakhali unless the lost confidence is regained, which will be the case if the Hindus and Muslims in these districts trust one another without needing the presence of the police or the military.
('93', 175, 3, 15, 354001) I observe that insistence on my leaving Noakhali is gathering volume.
('93', 175, 3, 16, 354071) You also share that feeling.
('93', 175, 3, 17, 354100) I urge you to show me how my presence offends and ask you to instruct the District Magistrate and the Superintendent of Police to keep a strict watch on my movements and tell these gentlemen in what way I have been erring.
('93', 175, 3, 18, 354323) Let me repeat my assurance that I have come here with no intention whatsoever of sowing dissension between the two communities or to prefer the interest of Hindus over that of Muslims.
('93', 175, 3, 19, 354508) I am doing everything I can to dispel all fear and the spirit of helplessness.
('93', 175, 3, 20, 354587) I have told you how the fear is still persisting.
('93', 175, 3, 21, 354637) I do wish that I could support your hope that the process of confidence and rehabilitation is making progress.
('93', 175, 3, 22, 354748) I must say I do not know that dissessions at the centre are widening nor have I the slightest notion that the Congress has accepted the lead of the great Hindu Mahasabha leader, Mr. Shyama Prasad Mukherji.
('93', 175, 3, 23, 354954) Throughout its long career it has never accepted the leadership of anyone who has not been avowedly a whole hearted Congressman.As to the rest of the points covered by my three letters

('93', 176, 8, 13, 355659) December 22, 1946
('93', 176, 9, 14, 355677) PYARELAL, Sushilas letter has brought me no peace.
('93', 176, 9, 15, 355728) I have not the strength or desire to argue any more.
('93', 176, 9, 16, 355781) I wish I could unsay whatever I have said by way of arguments.
('93', 176, 9, 17, 355844) I may not mention her name, speak of her or write about her letters that others may see these are conditions impossible for me to fulfil.
('93', 176, 9, 18, 355982) I therefore do not propose to write except in specific public interest.
('93', 176, 9, 19, 356054) But I do think it necessary that for my satisfaction you should visit her from time to time and write to her at least one letter every day and ask for reply.
('93', 176, 9, 20, 356212) In my opinion either she is out of her senses, or I am.
('93', 176, 9, 21, 356268) I do not notice the symptoms in me.
('93', 176, 9, 22, 356304) This incident has nothing at all to do with what Devdas, etc.
('93', 176, 9, 23, 356366) I do not wish to turn her away.
('93', 176, 9, 24, 356398) The cause of the friction is that I do not wish to take any service from her.
('93', 176, 9, 25, 356476) I do not see how I can make it my duty to take service from her.
('93', 176, 9, 26, 356541) I consider the present spectacle very bad for Manu.
('93', 176, 9, 27, 356593) I have given my soul to protect her and I am still doing it.
('93', 176, 9, 28, 356654) I wanted to achieve two purposes by letting her come: first, she would be in a better situation and, secondly, you would be restored to normalcy.
('93', 176, 9, 29, 356800) But for that, I
('93', 177, 0, 1, 356816) 178 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('93', 177, 1, 2, 356858) would not have accepted her conditions.
('93', 177, 1, 3, 356898) When I feel the need I may take service from anybody.
('93', 177, 1, 4, 356952) But how can anyone wanting to serve lay down conditions ?
('93', 177, 1, 5, 357010) If your attitude is the same as Sushilas, you too must consider whether you should continue any relations with me.
('93', 177, 1, 6, 357125) What personal benefit can you have in remaining with me ?
('93', 177, 1, 7, 357183) If you continue to be with me under pressure or unwillingly, it will do no good to you or to Sushila or to me.
('93', 177, 1, 8, 357294) The position which Sushila is maintaining is in my opinion against dharma.
('93', 177, 1, 9, 357369) Why should a personal question of this kind arise at this moment at all ?
('93', 177, 1, 10, 357443) I belive that you can keep nothing secret from Manu.
('93', 177, 1, 11, 357496) That is what I have understood from you.
('93', 177, 1, 12, 357537) I have not even liked the note, of which she has no knowledge.
('93', 177, 1, 13, 357600) As for Sushila you can tell her (Manu) that from sheer helplessness you must withhold things from her.
('93', 177, 1, 14, 357703) As I have understood you, you have absolutely no reason to hold back anything from her.
('93', 177, 1, 15, 357791) If you have not understood how I have presented your case to her, ask me, and I shall again try to explain it to you.
('93', 177, 1, 16, 357909) You need not give me a copy of my letter to Sushila, nor of my letter to you.
('93', 177, 1, 17, 357987) I did express the desire to have copies of both the letters but it is not important.
('93', 177, 1, 18, 358072) You can write or tell Sushila anything you wish out of this letter or the whole of it.

('93', 178, 2, 3, 358727) December 23, 1946 I do not know what God is doing to me or through me.
('93', 178, 2, 4, 358798) If you have the time and inclination I would like you to walk to Sushila at daybreak and return after passing some time with her and learning all about her requirements and her health.
('93', 178, 2, 5, 358983) You can give her the whole of our conversation 2 about her without reserve.
('93', 178, 2, 6, 359059) The rest you will know from her if she cares to tell you.
('93', 178, 2, 7, 359117) You can show this to her if you wish.
('93', 178, 2, 8, 359155) If you propose to shoulder this burden, you will act as the spirit moves you.
('93', 178, 2, 9, 359233) Dont work beyond your capacity.

('93', 178, 5, 12, 359320) December 23, 1946 I do not want them to hunger strike at present.
('93', 178, 5, 13, 359386) Let there be a full cause ready for such a strike.
('93', 178, 5, 14, 359437) The question therefore is: are those who get their rations prepared to share with those (300) what they get?
('93', 178, 5, 15, 359546) If they are, these should take their share while the matter is being prosecuted.

('93', 178, 9, 20, 359811) As an English Divine has said, when a man does his duty he is really discharging an obligation.

('93', 179, 1, 3, 360584) In doing the little I am able to for Bihar and Noakhali, I am doing no more than a serious attempt to discharge an obligation.
('93', 179, 1, 4, 360711) My firmness is at present on its greatest trial.
('93', 179, 1, 5, 360760) Shall I be able to stick to truth and non violence in word, deed and thought in the midst of the greatest suspicion, distrust and exaggeration?

('93', 179, 5, 13, 361305) It is, as you know, my silence day.
('93', 179, 5, 14, 361341) You had given me a sample of the slivers made from cotton carded by Ratilal.
('93', 179, 5, 15, 361418) I spun all of them.
('93', 179, 5, 16, 361438) They were fine.
('93', 179, 5, 17, 361454) The slivers for spinning such fine count yarn are long and are wrapped in leaves or paper.
('93', 179, 5, 18, 361545) I wish Ratilals venture all success.
('93', 179, 5, 19, 361582) Manudi is very well.
('93', 179, 5, 20, 361603) She is giving me satisfaction.
('93', 179, 5, 21, 361634) I heard from her that you recite the Ramayana as sweetly as Paramanand Gandhi 1 used to do.
('93', 179, 5, 22, 361726) When I heard that, I felt sorry that I did not know it earlier; had I known it, I would certainly have urged you to stay on for a while and asked you to recite some portions.
('93', 179, 5, 23, 361901) Parmanandbhais melodious voice still echoes in my ears.
('93', 179, 5, 24, 361957) I dont think you saw him.
('93', 179, 5, 25, 361983) Kalidas 2 has inherited a little of that sweetness.

('93', 181, 1, 2, 363630) 244. SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING 1
('93', 181, 2, 3, 363662) SRIRAMPUR, December 23, 1946
('93', 181, 3, 4, 363691) Gandhiji first referred to certain personal letters addressed to him as well as a number of articles or comments published in newspapers in which the opinion had been expressed that his continued presence in Noakhali was acting as a deterrent to the restoration of cordial relations between the Hindus and Muslims for his intention was to bring discredit upon the League Ministry in Bengal.
('93', 181, 4, 5, 364082) Two days ago he had tried to refute a rumour that a satyagraha movement of an extensive character was secretly planned by him in Noakhali.
('93', 181, 4, 6, 364221) He had already said that nothing could be done by him in secret.
('93', 181, 4, 7, 364286) If recourse were taken to secrecy and falsehood, satyagraha would degenerate into duragraha.
('93', 181, 5, 8, 364379) Today he found it necessary to answer the second charge levelled against him, to which reference had already been made.
('93', 181, 5, 9, 364499) He would like to proclaim that he had come to Bengal solely with the object of establishing heart unity between the two communities, who had become estranged from one another.
('93', 181, 5, 10, 364675) When that object was satisfactorily achieved, there would no longer be any necessity for him to prolong his stay.
('93', 181, 6, 11, 364789) His intention could never be to embarrass the League Government in Bengal, Gandhiji added.
('93', 181, 6, 12, 364880) On the other hand, his relations with the Ministry, as well as with the officials, had been very cordial and he had been able to gather the impression that all of them looked with favour upon his peace mission.
('93', 181, 6, 13, 365091) He had discovered no indication yet of his presence causing embarrassment to anyone.
('93', 181, 6, 14, 365176) It was open to the Government to ask the Magistrate and the Superintendent of Police to convince him of his error if they were themselves convinced.
('93', 181, 6, 15, 365325) As yet they had said not a word to that effect.
('93', 181, 6, 16, 365373) If he felt convinced of any error on his part, he would leave.
('93', 181, 7, 17, 365436) Gandhiji said that he had enough work to do elsewhere which demanded his attention.
('93', 181, 7, 18, 365520) There was Uruli Kanchan, the seat of his nature cure experiments, and Sevagram, and there was Delhi again, where he might be of some service.
('93', 181, 7, 19, 365662) He would love to spare trouble to the leaders who had to come to this out of the way place in order to consult him.
('93', 181, 7, 20, 365778) But personally he felt convinced that the work undertaken by him here was of the greatest importance for all India.
('93', 181, 7, 21, 365894) If he succeeded in his present mission, it was bound to have a profound influence on the future of India, and, if he might be permitted to say so, even on the future peace of the world, for it was to be a test of faith in non violence.

('93', 182, 1, 2, 366211) A copy of the Bihar Provincial Muslim League Report on the Bihar atrocities had been sent to him.
('93', 182, 1, 3, 366309) He had gone through it with care and had felt that it bristled with over statements.
('93', 182, 1, 4, 366394) Nevertheless, he was making inquiries on the basis of the report.
('93', 182, 1, 5, 366460) It was certainly true that much that had happened in Bihar was brutal enough and deserved the severest condemnation.
('93', 182, 1, 6, 366577) The overstatement blurred the gruesomeness of the reality.
('93', 182, 1, 7, 366636) He was assured that calm had been restored.
('93', 182, 1, 8, 366680) It was on that assurance that normal diet was resumed by him.
('93', 182, 2, 9, 366742) The reason why he had not proceeded to Bihar, Gandhiji explained, was that he could exercise his personal influence effectively even from a distance.
('93', 182, 2, 10, 366892) But if there were any reason to suspect that things still continued in Bihar in the manner described in the League report and that he had been misled by false assurance of his friends, then his place would surely be in that Province and he might even confess that this might imply that the life in the present body was now over and that there was no longer any room for him in the land of the living.
('93', 182, 3, 11, 367293) But he could not help uttering a word of warning that leaders of public opinion had a serious responsibility.
('93', 182, 3, 12, 367403) Their word would be believed by the credulous public, and they all knew the tragic consequences.
('93', 182, 3, 13, 367500) This he said irrespective of whether the leaders belonged to the Congress or the Muslim League.

('93', 182, 8, 26, 368122) One day he noticed a changed look in the face of one of his companions and recorded his observation in his diary .
('93', 182, 8, 27, 368237) A few days later, this same worker absented himself from the camp without telling him, thinking it too trivial a matter to bother him with.
('93', 182, 8, 28, 368377) But he took a very grave view of it and afterwards remarked that it revealed to him in a flash the nature of the goings on about him.
('93', 182, 8, 29, 368511) He was filled with anguish when a trusted co worker made a statement to another which he denied afterwards when Gandhiji confronted him with it.
('93', 182, 8, 30, 368656) On still another occasion he became angry and did not rest till he had owned his lapse and 'utter unworthiness' before the evening prayer gathering."

('93', 183, 6, 10, 369313) MY DEAR SHAHEED, I remind you of our pleasant meeting in Faridpur when Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das was still in his physical case.
('93', 183, 6, 11, 369444) If I remember rightly, you were the only one sitting in front of me spinning assiduously, though you were unable to pull an even or fine thread.
('93', 183, 6, 12, 369589) And then, if I remember rightly, when I applied to you some distant adjective of affection, you corrected me by saying that you felt as son to me.
('93', 183, 6, 13, 369736) I would like to think still that you are the same Shaheed and to feel proud that my son has become Chief Minister of Bengal.
('93', 183, 7, 14, 369861) I wish you had Bengal on the brain rather than Bihar.
('93', 183, 7, 15, 369915) Assume the truth of all that has been said in the Bihar provincial Muslim League's reports.
('93', 183, 7, 16, 370007) You do not want to satisfy yourself by thanking God for Bengal being as bad as Bihar.
('93', 183, 7, 17, 370093) You seem to believe the stories of Bihar cruelties with which you have been regaled.
('93', 183, 7, 18, 370178) I frankly confess to you that these reports do not carry conviction to me.
('93', 183, 7, 19, 370253) If even 50 per cent of the stories are true, life would become a burden for me.
('93', 183, 7, 20, 370333) You should know that though here, I was able to affect events in Bihar by my putting myself on protein and fat free diet and by my proposal, if things did not mend, to undertake complete fast.

('93', 184, 1, 4, 370866) Refugees ought not to be threatened with stoppage of rations.
('93', 184, 1, 5, 370928) There are several other humane ways of inducing them to return to their homes.
('93', 184, 1, 6, 371007) If you really want them to do so, you ought to supply them with proper food, warm clothing and decent habitation .
('93', 184, 1, 7, 371122) If you cannot do so, because of want of funds or sufficient workers, it would be quite proper and honourable to make that announcement and let philanthropists do the needful.
('93', 184, 1, 8, 371297) There are workers enough in the country who would respond to the call.
('93', 184, 1, 9, 371368) You, single handed, will not be able to cope with the work.
('93', 184, 1, 10, 371428) And if you really mean the thing, you ought to send a responsible Minister whose sole task would be to attend to this public duty.

('93', 184, 6, 16, 371759) Gandhiji began his speech by saying that complaints had been pouring in that people were unable to shed their fear because persons known to be guilty were freely moving about.
('93', 184, 6, 17, 371935) He said that although this might be true, his advice to them would still be to take courage in both hands and return to their homes.
('93', 184, 6, 18, 372068) When several persons had complained that the amount offered by the Government for rebuilding was inadequate for the erection of any kind of shelter, he felt sure that the Government which was determined on repatriation would extend their aid to the necessary extent.
('93', 184, 7, 19, 372335) What Gandhiji would personally prefer was that the refugees should be resourceful enough to tide over the present difficulty.
('93', 184, 7, 20, 372461) He would honour a man who begged nothing for himself nor depended on outside aid for protection.
('93', 184, 7, 21, 372558) If anyone depended on him for that purpose, he was depending on a broken reed.
('93', 184, 8, 22, 372637) 1 Replying on December 25, the addressee said that he could not spare any minister for Noakhali for the time being as there was considerable amount of administrative work to be done at Calcutta.
('93', 184, 8, 23, 372832) He could certainly.
('93', 184, 8, 24, 372852) have no objection to Gandhiji bringing to the notice of local officers any complaints he received.

('93', 185, 1, 4, 373116) Everyone should realize the secret that oppression thrived only when the oppressed submitted to it.
('93', 185, 1, 5, 373216) If they shed fear from their hearts, nobody would or could oppress them.

('93', 185, 4, 9, 373375) My blessings to the temple entry movements should be presumed.

('93', 185, 7, 13, 373539) SRIRAMPUR, December 25, 1946 CHI.
('93', 185, 7, 14, 373573) VALLABHBHAI, Your letter addressed to Pyarelal reached me direct yesterday.
('93', 185, 7, 15, 373649) Pyarelal and all the rest are engrossed in their own duties and are staking their lives.
('93', 185, 7, 16, 373738) He could, when we were together at one place, write or send you something.
('93', 185, 7, 17, 373813) He cannot do so now.
('93', 185, 7, 18, 373834) Your letter went to Kazirkhil; so Satis Babu forwarded it to me here.
('93', 185, 7, 19, 373904) Pyarelal does not know about your letter.
('93', 185, 7, 20, 373946) He comes to see me occasionally and will read it when he comes here next.
('93', 185, 7, 21, 374020) I am dictating this at 3 a.m.
('93', 185, 7, 22, 374050) I shall have a wash at 4 a.m.
('93', 185, 7, 23, 374080) and prayers after that.
('93', 185, 7, 24, 374104) This is the present routine.
('93', 185, 7, 25, 374133) I shall carry on only if such is God's will.
('93', 185, 7, 26, 374178) However, there is no need to worry about my health.
('93', 185, 7, 27, 374230) The body responds to the demands made upon it, but I am being tested.
('93', 185, 7, 28, 374300) My truth and non violence are being weighed in a balance which is much more accurate than any pearl merchant ever used.
('93', 185, 7, 29, 374420) It is so sensitive as to register the difference of even a hundredth fraction of a hair.
('93', 185, 7, 30, 374509) Truth and non violence themselves can never be imperfect.
('93', 185, 7, 31, 374567) If anything is to be found wanting, it may be I who have constituted myself their representative; if so, I at least hope that God
('93', 185, 8, 32, 374697) 1 The message was sent "in connection with the temple entry movement that has been launched" by Andhra Harijan Sevak Sangh, of which the addressee was Secretary.
('93', 185, 8, 33, 374859) The Report appeared under the date line Srirampur, December 25. 2 ibid
('93', 186, 0, 1, 374930) VOL. 93: 7 NOVEMBER, 1946 16 FEBRUARY, 1947 187
('93', 186, 1, 2, 374978) will take me away and work through some other agent.
('93', 186, 1, 3, 375031) I am sorry that I cannot myself do the work which Pyarelal used to do for me and I have not yet been able to arrange with the two men who are with me to do it.
('93', 186, 1, 4, 375191) But both are intelligent.
('93', 186, 1, 5, 375217) I therefore hope to be able to arrange it.
('93', 186, 1, 6, 375260) In this, your letter will afford me encouragement.
('93', 186, 1, 7, 375311) Jaisukhlal left Manu here at her own wish three or four days ago.
('93', 186, 1, 8, 375377) I allowed her to come and stay with me on her terms, as she was prepared to live and die with me if necessary.
('93', 186, 1, 9, 375488) And now I am dictating this to her, lying with my eyes closed so as to avoid strain.
('93', 186, 1, 10, 375573) Sucheta 1 is also in the room.
('93', 186, 1, 11, 375604) She is still asleep and I am dictating this letter in a low voice, lying on the wooden bedstead.
('93', 186, 1, 12, 375701) The bedstead is of a size on which three persons can easily sleep.
('93', 186, 1, 13, 375768) I do all my work on it.
('93', 186, 1, 14, 375792) The telegram you have forwarded to me has no substance.
('93', 186, 1, 15, 375848) There is no limit to exaggeration here.
('93', 186, 1, 16, 375888) Not that people exaggerate intentionally; they simply do not know what exaggeration means.
('93', 186, 1, 17, 375979) The imagination of the people runs riot like the local vegetation which grows like grass on all sides.
('93', 186, 1, 18, 376082) All around us I find huge coconut and betelnut palms, and a large variety of greens grow in their shade.
('93', 186, 1, 19, 376187) The rivers are all [big] like the Indus, the Ganges, the Jumna and the Brahmaputra.
('93', 186, 1, 20, 376271) They empty their waters into the Bay of Bengal.
('93', 186, 1, 21, 376319) My advice is that if you have not already replied to the correspondent who sent you the telegram, you should ask him to furnish proof for his statements so that the Central Government may try to do something about it though they have no power to interfere in terms of the Constitution.
('93', 186, 1, 22, 376605) And add: Gandhi is there in your midst and it is impossible that he would not listen to you.
('93', 186, 1, 23, 376698) But he is an apostle of truth and non violence and it is therefore likely that you are disappointed with him.
('93', 186, 1, 24, 376808) But if he disap points you, how can we, who were trained under him, hope to satisfy you ?
('93', 186, 1, 25, 376898) But we shall do what we can. Dont tell anyone that since I am here, he need not bring his problems to you.
('93', 186, 1, 26, 377005) Tell him that he may write to you nevertheless and that it will be your duty to afford relief to him even by going against me, for that is what I have taught you.
('93', 186, 1, 27, 377168) The situation here poses many difficulties and problems.
('93', 186, 1, 28, 377225) Truth is nowhere to be found.
('93', 186, 1, 29, 377255) Violence masquerades as non violence and heinous crimes are committed in the name of religion.
('93', 186, 1, 30, 377350) But truth and non violence can be tested only in such conditions.
('93', 186, 1, 31, 377416) I know this and that is why I am here.
('93', 186, 1, 32, 377455) Do not send for me.
('93', 186, 1, 33, 377475) If I run away from cowardice that will be my own misfortune; but I do not yet see such a misfortune befalling the country.
('93', 186, 1, 34, 377598) I am here to do or die.

('93', 187, 1, 2, 377694) over the radio yesterday that Jawaharlal, Kripalani and Deo are coming to have consultations with me.
('93', 187, 1, 3, 377796) That is good.
('93', 187, 1, 4, 377810) What is the use of my meeting everyone?
('93', 187, 1, 5, 377850) However, if anyone among you wants to ask me anything, he is welcome.
('93', 187, 1, 6, 377920) What I wrote 1 about Assam was not meant for immediate publication.
('93', 187, 1, 7, 377988) If you know how it came to be published, please let me know.
('93', 187, 1, 8, 378049) But rest assured that I am right on that point.
('93', 187, 1, 9, 378097) I am in the furnace here.
('93', 187, 1, 10, 378123) I, therefore, am in a good enough position to testify what is happening in it and what the truth is.
('93', 187, 1, 11, 378224) [Sardar Jivan Singh] 2 often comes to me, asks for suggestions and assures me that he will implement them to the letter.
('93', 187, 1, 12, 378345) I think I can trust him.
('93', 187, 1, 13, 378370) I had a wire from [Sardar Niranjan Singh] 3 saying that he had not been able to win you over.
('93', 187, 1, 14, 378464) But I did not understand what he actually meant.
('93', 187, 1, 15, 378513) Tell him this if he is there and if you happen to meet him.
('93', 187, 1, 16, 378573) And if you have been able to understand what he wants to ask me, let me know.
('93', 187, 1, 17, 378651) You will have seen the report of the Bihar [Muslim] League.
('93', 187, 1, 18, 378711) I have written to Rajendra Babu about it and have asked him to acquaint all of you with my views.
('93', 187, 1, 19, 378809) I have written 4 to the Chief Minister also.
('93', 187, 1, 20, 378854) It is dreadful even if half of it is true.
('93', 187, 1, 21, 378897) I have no doubt at all that an impartial commission of inquiry, which is above reproach, should be immediately set up.
('93', 187, 1, 22, 379016) There should not be delay of even a single day.
('93', 187, 1, 23, 379064) Whatever is true in the allegations must be admitted straight away and the rest should be referred to the commission.
('93', 187, 1, 24, 379182) Discuss this with your Muslim League colleagues in the Cabinet also.
('93', 187, 1, 25, 379251) I am in correspo ndence with Suhrawardy.
('93', 187, 1, 26, 379292) It is continuing.
('93', 187, 1, 27, 379310) I will send it all to you when it is completed.
('93', 187, 1, 28, 379358) Jawahar and others will see what has passed between us so far.
('93', 187, 1, 29, 379421) If you are not doing so already, please read the summaries of my postprayer speeches which are sent to the newspapers.
('93', 187, 1, 30, 379540) Or go through the cuttings which Mani 5 may give you.
('93', 187, 1, 31, 379594) I know even from here the great pressure under which you are working, but there are certain things which have got to be done despite the pressure.
('93', 187, 1, 32, 379741) To keep yourself informed of what I say, is one

('93', 187, 3, 35, 380010) In his letter dated December 19, he had requested the addressee to approve his budget for the relief work, and had also requested that the number of workers be increased from 100 to 300 and the programme be made for longer period.
('93', 187, 3, 36, 380241) On December 22, the addressee had replied that the budget amount was too lavish to be approved by Gandhiji and that for the present the number of workers be limited to 100 and only for a period no longer than three months.

('93', 188, 1, 4, 380638) I will assume that you are well enough to carry on the work.
('93', 188, 1, 5, 380699) I am sure you can improve your health.
('93', 188, 1, 6, 380738) I would still advise you to send for Dinshaw 1 .
('93', 188, 1, 7, 380787) I have no doubt that he is a good and a sincere man with an altruistic outlook.
('93', 188, 1, 8, 380867) What if he is not so efficient?
('93', 188, 1, 9, 380899) You ask about Sushila 2 .
('93', 188, 1, 10, 380925) I cannot say that she is in very good health.
('93', 188, 1, 11, 380971) She too is in an inhospitable village and is doing good work.
('93', 188, 1, 12, 381033) Even a quack is a rarity in these parts; so naturally people make much of someone like her.
('93', 188, 1, 13, 381125) Do not, therefore, be anxious for any of us here.
('93', 188, 1, 14, 381175) And when everyone of them is here, ready to die, their falling ill should be of no great concern.
('93', 188, 1, 15, 381273) If one dies, it is as well; only let the death be pure and earn commendation.

('93', 189, 3, 5, 382500) I like the suggestion very much.
('93', 189, 3, 6, 382533) She deserves to be encouraged in her generosity.
('93', 189, 3, 7, 382582) Shankarlal, moreover, is not begging for an outright gift.
('93', 189, 3, 8, 382641) He may even pay some interest.
('93', 189, 3, 9, 382672) There is, therefore, no risk.
('93', 189, 3, 10, 382702) And even if the sum is lost, how will it matter ?

('93', 189, 7, 19, 383060) SRIRAMPUR, December 25, 1946
('93', 189, 8, 20, 383089) Sailen Chatterjee who appeared to Gandhiji more as a fellow worker in the cause of independence than a journalist, asked him whether he would, in his post prayer remarks, say something about Christianity because it was Christmas Day and reminded him that he had done some such thing on the previous Christmas Day.
('93', 189, 8, 21, 383403) Gandhiji said he had not thought of it though he should have .
('93', 189, 9, 22, 383466) He said he was thankful for the reminder and he informed the audience that he had accepted the suggestion without the slightest hesitation.
('93', 189, 9, 23, 383606) Then he had to think about what he should say.
('93', 189, 9, 24, 383653) He was baffled about his choice for he said that it was almost universally realized that everywhere irreligion masqueraded as religion.
('93', 189, 10, 25, 383789) Whilst he was searching for something apposite for the occasion he thought of two beautiful note books in which Rajkumari had copied out gems from the Bible and Christian hymns.
('93', 189, 10, 26, 383967) Rajkumari had been chosen by Pandit Nehru, their Foreign Minister at the Centre, as a member of the deputation on behalf of the Government of India to represent it in the Educational Conference that was held in Paris.
('93', 189, 10, 27, 384185) She was a member of the ruling family of Kapurthala.
('93', 189, 10, 28, 384238) Her father would have occupied the gadi,
('93', 190, 0, 1, 384279) VOL. 93: 7 NOVEMBER, 1946 16 FEBRUARY, 1947 191
('93', 190, 1, 2, 384327) but for his being a Christian.
('93', 190, 2, 3, 384358) Rajkumari was proud of being considered a Sikh, a Hindu and a Christian and had chosen to throw in her lot with those who were downtrodden.
('93', 190, 2, 4, 384498) He would invite the audience to give thought to the best from Christianity which he had selected from Rajkumari's collection.
('93', 190, 2, 5, 384624) Only a few days ago he commended to their attention two of the best sayings from Prophet Mohammed.
('93', 190, 3, 6, 384723) He believed in equal regard for all religions.
('93', 190, 3, 7, 384770) Mere tolerance was not of much value.
('93', 190, 3, 8, 384808) No religion worth the name stood in need of patronage.
('93', 190, 3, 9, 384863) It should command respect.
('93', 190, 3, 10, 384890) He added that Jesus Christ might be looked upon as belonging to Christians only but he really did not belong to any community inasmuch as the lesson that Jesus Christ gave belonged to the whole world 1 .
('93', 190, 3, 11, 385094) So saying, he asked Prof.
('93', 190, 3, 12, 385120) Nirmal Bose to translate the following 2 from the New Testament on love, which he preferred to render as ahimsa.

('93', 190, 6, 15, 385316) December 26, 1946
('93', 190, 7, 16, 385334) QUESTION 1. Would it not be better to have pure joint electorate with reservation of seats, than the half joint and half separate electorate which we have today ?
('93', 190, 8, 17, 385497) ANSWER 1. The answer to your Ist question is yes.
('93', 190, 8, 18, 385547) Second is very difficult.
('93', 190, 9, 19, 385573) Q. 2. When you speak about the removal of untouchability among Harijans, to whom do you refer ?
('93', 190, 9, 20, 385669) Which section among us ?
('93', 190, 9, 21, 385694) For many among us, scheduled people, consider themselves higher than the rest.
('93', 190, 10, 22, 385773) A. 2. I agree with you that the removal of untouchability among the so called untouchables is more difficult than its removal between caste Hindus and non caste Hindus, i.e., untouchables.
('93', 190, 11, 23, 385962) Q. 3. Will not our condition truly improve only when Congressmen take up Harijan service in earnest, rather than leave it to the fitful efforts of political adventurers among Scheduled Caste people ?
('93', 190, 12, 24, 386162) A. 3. The answer to your 3rd undoubtedly yes.
('93', 190, 13, 25, 386208) Q. 4. Could not men like Sarat Babu, Kiran Babu do something to spread the message

('93', 191, 2, 4, 386652) Many others who have more leisure have been doing for a long time the class of work referred to by you.

('93', 191, 4, 8, 386870) 254. LETTER TO MANILAL B. DESAI
('93', 191, 5, 9, 386902) SRIRAMPUR, December 26, 1946
('93', 191, 6, 10, 386931) MANILAL, I got your letter and the supplement.
('93', 191, 6, 11, 386978) I cannot recollect the letter which you mention, and am not bothering to search for it.
('93', 191, 6, 12, 387066) Strictly speaking, the suggestion about cows does not fall within the scope of the Trust.
('93', 191, 6, 13, 387156) You can establish contact with the Goseva Sangh.
('93', 191, 6, 14, 387205) If you try to do that work, you will not be able to do the work you have undertaken.
('93', 191, 6, 15, 387290) In attempting an ambitious plan, you may fail in both the tasks like the sadhu who lost both this world and the next.
('93', 191, 6, 16, 387408) Or you may undertake the work in consultation with somebody who knows it.
('93', 191, 6, 17, 387482) The idea of making the Arogyabhavan self supporting is not a bad one.
('93', 191, 6, 18, 387552) But if you engage two persons for that work, no work will be done and your plan for starting cultivation will have to be abandoned.
('93', 191, 6, 19, 387684) The difficulty about money can be met.
('93', 191, 6, 20, 387723) It is not necessary to employ some persons specially for that purpose.
('93', 191, 6, 21, 387794) As soon as I know the final decision, I shall be able to find the money.
('93', 191, 6, 22, 387867) You will of course need a well.
('93', 191, 6, 23, 387899) Get one sunk.
('93', 191, 6, 24, 387913) I think you mean a deep well to be sunk at a cost of Rs. 4,000. I am inclined towards a well of that type.
('93', 191, 6, 25, 388020) Or, we can have the type of water works constructed by the military and can draw the water in the same way as they do.
('93', 191, 6, 26, 388139) I think we can get enough water from the water works built by them.
('93', 191, 6, 27, 388207) We cannot have a buffalo in the goshala.
('93', 191, 6, 28, 388248) I have no doubt on this point.
('93', 191, 6, 29, 388279) If we do not insist on having cows only, you may rest assured that they will die out.
('93', 191, 6, 30, 388365) And the cow will always be followed by the buffalo.
('93', 191, 6, 31, 388417) Animal husbandry experts have finally come to this conclusion.
('93', 191, 6, 32, 388480) I cannot judge about buying the plot belonging to Patangiya.
('93', 191, 6, 33, 388541) All that I can say is that you may do what you think best.

('93', 192, 1, 2, 388648) I think this answers all your questions.
('93', 192, 1, 3, 388689) It is, therefore, not necessary for you to travel all this distance.
('93', 192, 1, 4, 388758) I am dictating this letter after waking up at three in the morning.
('93', 192, 1, 5, 388826) I don't have the courage, therefore, to try to write to Dr. Bhagwat, Dhirubhai and others, as it is nearing four o'clock now and I have to start preparing for the prayer.
('93', 192, 1, 6, 388997) I understand about Dhulia.
('93', 192, 1, 7, 389024) If Maganbhai cannot stay there regularly and take active interest in the work of the Trust for a few months in the year at least, there will be no point in making him one of the Trustees.
('93', 192, 1, 8, 389212) I think I have written to you about this in a previous letter.
('93', 192, 1, 9, 389275) I will [not], therefore, [write more in this].

('93', 192, 5, 13, 389448) SRIRAMPUR, December 26, 1946
('93', 192, 6, 14, 389477) BAPA, I have your letter.
('93', 192, 6, 15, 389503) Two persons are certain to come on behalf of the Sikhs.
('93', 192, 6, 16, 389559) I am not going to send them back in a hurry.
('93', 192, 6, 17, 389604) I must admit that I cannot command the pace at which you go.
('93', 192, 6, 18, 389665) I don't have the time to find out why.
('93', 192, 6, 19, 389704) Today I am up since 2 o'clock.
('93', 192, 6, 20, 389735) It does not harm me.
('93', 192, 6, 21, 389756) Nowadays I have made it a practice to get up at 3 o'clock.
('93', 192, 6, 22, 389815) Yet, I cannot say that I am able to finish the day's work.
('93', 192, 6, 23, 389874) I don't want you to come when Jawaharlal comes.
('93', 192, 6, 24, 389922) It will be strenuous.
('93', 192, 6, 25, 389944) Consi dering that you have just recovered from fever you should not strain yourself so much.
('93', 192, 6, 26, 390037) If you go to Delhi fairly late, I hope I shall be there when you are there.
('93', 192, 6, 27, 390113) If this cannot be, I am sure to be there during your absence.
('93', 192, 6, 28, 390175) I wish we could meet before you went to Delhi.
('93', 192, 6, 29, 390222) I have had a good deal of talk with Abha who has grown wings.
('93', 192, 6, 30, 390284) She is now prepared to live in a village and has, in consultation with Satis Babu, selected Chandigram, which is five miles from here.
('93', 192, 6, 31, 390419) Here, too, she has met a number of Muslim families.
('93', 192, 6, 32, 390471) She even took me to a
('93', 193, 0, 1, 390493) 194 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('93', 193, 1, 2, 390535) place in the hope of introducing me to the women who, however, never came out.
('93', 193, 1, 3, 390614) Abha had her object lesson.
('93', 193, 1, 4, 390642) I already knew that the women would not come out but I agreed to go with her because they had made a promise to Abha.
('93', 193, 1, 5, 390760) Abha spoke to me about the two girls whom you have selected to be sent to the Mahila Ashram.
('93', 193, 1, 6, 390853) Shantabai also has been consulted.
('93', 193, 1, 7, 390888) The younger one is to be sent to the Mahila Ashram and the older one to the Balika Ashram.
('93', 193, 1, 8, 390979) Both will thus have different experiences.
('93', 193, 1, 9, 391022) I see advantage in it.
('93', 193, 1, 10, 391045) Are you sure you are not being hasty in organizing the people's programme in different places?
('93', 193, 1, 11, 391140) But for this doubt I have nothing to say on the matter.
('93', 193, 1, 12, 391196) Now, if you agree to my suggestion about Abha, I wouldfurther suggest that you send her soon so that she takes up the work, because [Chandigram] will be my first camp during the tour.
('93', 193, 1, 13, 391380) She would like to be there before that, and so would I. If Malati 1 has already arrived there.
('93', 193, 1, 14, 391475) I have nothing to say.
('93', 193, 1, 15, 391498) But don't send for her if she does not come for the present.

('93', 193, 7, 21, 391699) This I am dictating to let you know about a person called Dr. Filchner concerning whom Dinshawji wrote to me.
('93', 193, 7, 22, 391809) I just cannot cope with the work.
('93', 193, 7, 23, 391843) Something or the other always remains in arrears.
('93', 193, 7, 24, 391893) So I do not know what is going to happen to me.
('93', 193, 7, 25, 391941) Whatever does happen will happen here.
('93', 193, 7, 26, 391980) I am very happy.

('93', 193, 7, 28, 392097) Do not worry on my account in the least.
('93', 193, 7, 29, 392138) If the person whom Dinshawji recommends can be allowed to remain, he should, in my opinion, be granted the permission.

('93', 194, 6, 9, 392609) PYARELAL, It was fortunate I did not have to go to Comilla.
('93', 194, 6, 10, 392669) But I must say that as long as we are living independently in separate villages, it is good to give up the temptation of going anywhereeven to the Working Committee meetings.
('93', 194, 6, 11, 392844) For the present, all attention must be concentrated on our respective villages.
('93', 194, 6, 12, 392924) Then only can we hope to succeed.
('93', 194, 6, 13, 392958) it is a difficult task.
('93', 194, 6, 14, 392982) But that alone is worth doing.
('93', 194, 6, 15, 393013) I am also not interested in attending the Working Committee.
('93', 194, 6, 16, 393074) But it may be my duty to attend.
('93', 194, 6, 17, 393107) Even for that I would not like to go far.
('93', 194, 6, 18, 393149) You will understand this more when you come here.

('93', 195, 9, 20, 394722) SRIRAMPUR, December 26, 1946
('93', 195, 10, 21, 394751) Gandhiji said that he had no doubt in his mind that the British would have to quit India.
('93', 195, 10, 22, 394841) But if Indians were foolish enough to quarrel among themselves, he could
('93', 195, 11, 23, 394914) 1 Extracted from Srirampur Diary which says The speech was provoked.
('93', 195, 11, 24, 394983) by the fact that when he asked some people offering to serve in Noakhali whether they would continue to serve, if necessary, for a lifetime even after he had left, they were reluctant to commit themselves.
('93', 195, 11, 25, 395189) This reluctance led him to believe that people were anxious to come and serve in a manner which would attract his attention and that such people were not keen on service for the sake of service."
('93', 196, 0, 1, 395385) VOL. 93: 7 NOVEMBER, 1946 16 FEBRUARY, 1947 197
('93', 196, 1, 2, 395433) very well visualize the destiny of the whole country.
('93', 196, 1, 3, 395487) India would probably be placed under the United Nations which would mean not one but many masters, and, hence, goodbye to independence.
('93', 196, 2, 4, 395623) He was soon going to make the greatest experiment of his life .
('93', 196, 2, 5, 395687) That would be perhaps his last experiment.
('93', 196, 2, 6, 395730) He was not a holder of any DegreeB.A. or M.A. But if he succeeded in the examination he was taking in Noakhali, he would think he had received his highest Degree of lifehis M.A. And if he succeeded in this examination of his, he would share all that he achieved together with his Degree with the forty crores of people of this country.
('93', 196, 3, 7, 396066) Continuing, Gandhiji said that the task he had undertaken in Bengal was most serious.
('93', 196, 3, 8, 396152) Here a community which had been friendly to him previously now looked upon him as its enemy.
('93', 196, 3, 9, 396245) He was out to prove that he was a real friend of the Muslims.
('93', 196, 3, 10, 396307) So he had chosen for his greatest experiment a place where the Muslims were in a majority.
('93', 196, 4, 11, 396398) For the fulfilment of his mission it would suffice if he toured the countryside alone, and the presence of the workers from outside soliciting his advice and direction raised fresh problems for him instead of assisting him to solve the already complicated task he had undertaken.
('93', 196, 4, 12, 396678) Much of the misunderstanding could be removed if those really keen on serving the people of Noakhali would directly approach the Bengal Ministers with their plan of work and obtain not only their written permission to carry on their work but also their approval of the plan.
('93', 196, 5, 13, 396953) Gandhiji gave this advice to some doctors who came from Bombay yesterday for rendering medical aid to the refugees in the affected areas.
('93', 196, 5, 14, 397091) To some people who sent him letters and telegrams offering to come to Noakhali for service, Gandhiji had replied that they could serve the cause by carrying on constructive work around their own places.
('93', 196, 5, 15, 397294) To those who sought directions as to how best to serve in Noakhali, Gandhiji said that he himself was groping in darkness and a blind man could not be the best guide.

('93', 197, 2, 3, 397790) December 27, 1946
('93', 197, 3, 4, 397808) DEAR HAMIDUDDIN SAHEB, Nirmal Babu read to me your writing in the Azad of the 14th instant.
('93', 197, 3, 5, 397900) It staggered me and I asked him kindly to give me its literal translation.
('93', 197, 3, 6, 397975) If there is any incorrectness, you will please send me your correction.
('93', 197, 3, 7, 398047) I say it staggered me, because you had left an impression on me that you had entirely realized my sincerity and my usefulness not merely for the Hindu inhabitants of the district but equally for the Muslim inhabitants.
('93', 197, 3, 8, 398266) Assuming the accuracy of the translation, your article is an indictment against me.
('93', 197, 3, 9, 398350) Indeed, most of us were under the impression that while Shamsuddin Saheb was leaving for a few days to meet the Chief Minister, You would be staying behind to continue his work and help the Peace Committees that were just then being formed.
('93', 197, 3, 10, 398591) But the next day, I learned with sorrow that owing to some affliction of your eyes you had to leave abruptly with Shamsuddin Saheb.
('93', 197, 3, 11, 398723) What had happened in the meanwhile to warrant what I have called your indictment I do not know.
('93', 197, 3, 12, 398819) Why do you in common with many advisers advise me to leave Noakhali and go to Bihar or somewhere else?
('93', 197, 4, 13, 398922) I have not come to East Bengal to hold an enquiry.
('93', 197, 4, 14, 398973) I have come to make my humble contribution to a lasting and heart peace between the two communities.
('93', 197, 4, 15, 399074) I think that I made this statement during the speeches I had made in your presence.
('93', 197, 4, 16, 399158) Why then the sudden change betrayed by the article in question ?
('93', 197, 4, 17, 399223) Do you not think that after the exuberant regard you showed for me, I had the right to expect from you a friendly and personal enquiry from me, to inform me of the change and giving the grounds for the change?
('93', 197, 4, 18, 399433) Perhaps, on reflection, you will discover in your very article valid reason for my longing to be in Noakhali in preference to Bihar.
('93', 197, 4, 19, 399566) How can I test the efficacy and soundness of my ahimsa except in a place where even the loudest protestations of trust in my professions can be so short lived as in your case ?
('93', 197, 4, 20, 399743) You are right when you say: "In Mr. Gandhi's opinion, the

('93', 198, 1, 2, 400002) condition in Noakhali is not yet such that Hindus can shoulder the responsibility of returning to their homes." I have chapter and verse to show why the Hindu refugees who proved themselves deficient in personal courage are reluctant to go back to their homes.
('93', 198, 1, 3, 400263) The peace Committees which you left in the process of formation are not in working order.
('93', 198, 1, 4, 400353) The Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries would not return to their work of seeing the Committees doing their duty.
('93', 198, 1, 5, 400471) I urge you for the sake of the League Ministry in whose efficiency and goodness I am at least as much interested as you ever can be.
('93', 198, 1, 6, 400604) Believe me, I have not come to East Bengal for the purpose of finding fault with the League.
('93', 198, 1, 7, 400697) I have come in order to induce it by my conduct to shed its complacency and give solid work for the sake of itself and india.
('93', 198, 1, 8, 400823) For I believe that if you and I can produce in Bengal the right atmosphere, the whole of India will follow.
('93', 198, 1, 9, 400931) You say, again :If he (Gandhi) had issued a statement about the real nature of the happenings, perhaps the atmosphere would have cleared to a large extent.
('93', 198, 1, 10, 401087) His silence with reference to this matter raises suspicion in the minds of many . Why this insinuation when the fact stares you in the face that I am not in a position to speak in praise of what has been and is being done on behalf of the Bengal Government?
('93', 198, 1, 11, 401345) If you will care to study the thing, you will appreciate restraint instead of coaxing me to speak.
('93', 198, 1, 12, 401444) You are again right when you say: Mr. Gandhi does not wish to leave for Bihar. But your reasons for reluctance are wholly wrong.
('93', 198, 1, 13, 401573) My trusted Bihari followers have indeed kept me informed of the happenings there.
('93', 198, 1, 14, 401655) The information they give is wholly contrary to what you believe.
('93', 198, 1, 15, 401721) In common with all, the Bihar Government deplore the tragic happenings.
('93', 198, 1, 16, 401793) But they claim that they have acquired control over the turbulent elements and are straining every nerve to give satisfaction to the afflicted.
('93', 198, 1, 17, 401937) It will not serve the cause of peace if I went to Bihar and found the Bihar Muslim Leagues report to be largely imaginary and the Bihar Governments conduct substantially honourable, humane and just.
('93', 198, 1, 18, 402136) I am not anxious to give them a certificate of good conduct as I am to give you, much though you may not want it.
('93', 198, 1, 19, 402250) My spare diet and contemplated fast, you know well, were against the Bihar misdoings.
('93', 198, 1, 20, 402336) I could not take such a step in the matter of Noakhali misdoings.
('93', 198, 1, 21, 402402) It pains me to think that you, a seasoned lawyer, should not see the
('93', 199, 0, 1, 402471) 200 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('93', 199, 1, 2, 402513) obvious.
('93', 199, 1, 3, 402522) I assure you that I am not guilty of importing numberless volunteers from outside to serve his (mine) object.
('93', 199, 1, 4, 402632) In the first place, I have not imported numberless volunteers.
('93', 199, 1, 5, 402695) In the second place, my object is not what you have been pleased to insinuate in the same paragraph.
('93', 199, 1, 6, 402796) Let me tell you that for the fulfilment of my object, I do not need any volunteers here except myself.
('93', 199, 1, 7, 402899) If you really think that their presence is a menace to the peace of Noakhali, the Government have but to say that they are a danger and to serve a notice on them to quit, and I assure you that without a murmur they would leave this district.
('93', 199, 1, 8, 403141) From this undertaking, I and one of my company, whose name I need not disclose at this stage, are excepted.
('93', 199, 1, 9, 403249) You will be astonished to learn that, dear as they are all to me, and valuable as I count their services to the nation, I told them in this mission of mine I had no need to have any associate with me; for the quickest way to fruition required no protection or co operation save what God sent.
('93', 199, 1, 10, 403542) Such is my conception of the working of ahimsa.
('93', 199, 1, 11, 403590) I hope that before the Government takes the adumbrated action they will depute an officer of their choice or trust to find out from me or them the kind of work they are doing.
('93', 199, 1, 12, 403766) Their life is an open book.
('93', 199, 1, 13, 403794) There is nothing hidden or underground about their activities.
('93', 199, 1, 14, 403857) Permit me to give you my impression that your writing bristles with unprovable and reckless statements without regard to facts.
('93', 199, 1, 15, 403985) I have noticed only some of them.
('93', 199, 1, 16, 404019) As it is, my letter has become much longer than I had sketched in my mind but as I proceeded I could not shorten it if I was to give you some conception of my deep grief.
('93', 199, 1, 17, 404190) If you will know more.
('93', 199, 1, 18, 404213) I suggest to you that you should take the trouble of coming to me and passing with me half an hour or so and cross examine me on the charges you have framed against me.
('93', 199, 1, 19, 404382) This letter is not an open letter as yours is.
('93', 199, 1, 20, 404429) I have written only for you, cherishing the hope that it may perhaps appeal to you as coming from a well wisher open to conviction.

('93', 200, 3, 16, 405232) You will be cured.

('93', 200, 8, 27, 405605) How is it ?
('93', 200, 8, 28, 405617) Your companions have asked for a doctor's assistance and a thermometer.
('93', 200, 8, 29, 405689) I have told them you need neither a doctor nor medicine.
('93', 200, 8, 30, 405746) Your medicine is earth, water, sky, sun and air, and along with it Ramanama.
('93', 200, 8, 31, 405823) Stand up in the open air, with Koran in hand, and absorb as much bright sunlight as you can tolerate and take in clean air and water.

('93', 201, 7, 13, 406632) December 27, 1946
('93', 201, 8, 14, 406650) There was nothing tangible to be shown yet, but non violence sometimes
('93', 201, 9, 15, 406721) worked in unexpected ways.
('93', 201, 10, 16, 406748) Gandhiji's advice to the Swamiji was that violence should be eschewed
('93', 201, 11, 17, 406818) altogether.
('93', 201, 11, 18, 406830) There should not even be a trace of it among the workers entrusted with
('93', 201, 12, 19, 406902) organizations.
('93', 201, 12, 20, 406917) He emphasized the need for constructive work which could bring food
('93', 201, 13, 21, 406985) to the hungry millions as well as anti untouchability work to remove the disabilities
('93', 201, 14, 22, 407071) which had crippled the Hindu society to a very large extent.

('93', 201, 17, 25, 407195) SRIRAMPUR, December 27, 1946
('93', 201, 18, 26, 407224) Gandhiji in his address said that a friend had been telling him that his reference 3 to darkness surrounding him was very confusing to many.
('93', 201, 18, 27, 407365) The friend thought that people at a distance saw light shimmering through his plan, and there was enough proof that the confidence was slowly returning in that affected area.
('93', 201, 19, 28, 407540) 1 The report said : Swami Jnanananda of Shakti Math, Dacca .
('93', 201, 19, 29, 407601) discussed with Gandhiji the situation prevailing in rural areas of Dacca and also the possibilities of constructive work in those places. 2 Extracted form Srirampur Diary 3 Vide Extract From Diary, 26 12 1946
('93', 202, 0, 1, 407810) VOL. 93: 7 NOVEMBER, 1946 16 FEBRUARY, 1947 203
('93', 202, 1, 2, 407858) Gandhiji said he would tell this friend and others who thought like him that they had misunderstood him to some extent.
('93', 202, 1, 3, 407978) The darkness in which he was surrounded was of a character the like of which had never faced him before.
('93', 202, 1, 4, 408083) It was indeed now a vital test that his ahimsa was passing through.
('93', 202, 1, 5, 408151) He would not be able to say that he had come out successful until the object was reached.
('93', 202, 2, 6, 408241) It was true that night was darkest before dawn.
('93', 202, 2, 7, 408289) He himself felt that and although friends at a distance could see glimpses of the breaking dawn, he himself felt that he was surrounded by complete darkness.
('93', 202, 3, 8, 408447) Gandhiji said that many years ago a friend of his used to carry Patanjali's Yogasutra constantly in his pocket.
('93', 202, 3, 9, 408559) Although Gandhiji did not know Sanskrit yet the friend would often come to him to consult about the meaning of some of the sutras.
('93', 202, 3, 10, 408690) In one of the sutras it was stated that when ahimsa had been fully established it would completely liquidate the forces of enmity and evil in the neighbourhood.
('93', 202, 3, 11, 408851) Gandhiji felt that the stage had not been reached in the neighbourhood about him and this led him to infer that his ahimsa had not yet succeeded in the present test.
('93', 202, 3, 12, 409017) That was the reason why he was saying that there was still darkness all round him.
('93', 202, 4, 13, 409100) Referring to a statement of Mr. Suhrawardy, Premier of Bengal, Gandhiji said it seemed to him that he was beginning to see glimpses of light.
('93', 202, 4, 14, 409242) The Bengal Premier had said that he hoped Mahatma Gandhi's mission would be successful and bring results beneficial not only to Bengal but to the whole of India.
('93', 202, 4, 15, 409404) The Bengal Premier had also said that he must provide escort to protect Mahatma Gandhi on his walking tour.
('93', 202, 4, 16, 409512) Gandhiji said that Mr. Suhrawardy had only been doing his duty in offering him protection.
('93', 202, 4, 17, 409603) He knew that military and police had been posted round about his cottage.
('93', 202, 4, 18, 409677) He sometimes exchanged greetings with them.
('93', 202, 4, 19, 409721) Beyond that he thought none could do so if God willed it otherwise.
('93', 202, 5, 20, 409789) Referring to his walking tour Gandhiji said in a couple of days details would be settled.
('93', 202, 5, 21, 409879) As soon as the programme was ready he would communicate it to the Bengal Premier, for he felt he should do nothing without his knowledge.
('93', 202, 6, 22, 410017) Gandhiji said that his plan was to proceed with the least number of companions on his march, and that he would prefer to stay in the houses of Muslim friends.
('93', 202, 6, 23, 410176) He had reduced his needs and these could be met even by the poorest villagers.
('93', 202, 6, 24, 410255) He would like to go absolutely unprotected if it was to prove that in his heart he had nothing but love and friendship for the Muslims.
('93', 202, 7, 25, 410391) Gandhiji said that if he was absolutely alone on his mission his services would have gained considerably in quality.
('93', 202, 7, 26, 410508) He would also have been able to assess in that case his ability for facing the present problem of Bengal.
('93', 202, 8, 27, 410614) 1 The following three paragraphs are reproduced from Hindustan Standard.
('93', 202, 8, 28, 410687) 2 What follows is reproduced from The Sunday Hindustan Standard.
('93', 203, 0, 1, 410752) 204 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('93', 203, 1, 2, 410794) Numerous friends had for some years past placed their services unreservedly at Gandhiji 's disposal.
('93', 203, 1, 3, 410895) When he first came on his mission to Noakhali, he had intended to dispense with the services of those friends.
('93', 203, 1, 4, 411006) His idea was to place himself absolutely in God's hands.
('93', 203, 1, 5, 411063) Of course God helped his devotees through human agency but in that case it would come naturally and without his asking.
('93', 203, 2, 6, 411183) If the original plan of coming here alone had been followed to the letter, complaints that were now being made against him would have been neutralized to a large extent.
('93', 203, 2, 7, 411353) Even now his advice to anyone who wished to serve in Noakhali would be not to seek his advice, far less to depend on his directions.
('93', 203, 3, 8, 411486) Those who would like to come here should instead contact the League Ministry and secure their written permission.
('93', 203, 3, 9, 411600) Moreover, they should place before the Ministry in detail the nature of work they propose to do and while working here they should confine their activities within that scheme and on no account go beyond it.
('93', 203, 3, 10, 411807) He was suggesting this course, because it was the League Ministry's authority which prevailed in this Province.
('93', 203, 4, 11, 411919) Today he was regarded as enemy number one by the League and if people from outside came to help him they were bound to be regarded as helping an enemy.
('93', 203, 4, 12, 412071) But he was very anxious that this should be avoided.
('93', 203, 5, 13, 412124) There were men and organizations who were of the opinion that Hindus who were numerically weak should learn self defence in terms of violence.
('93', 203, 5, 14, 412267) Muslims on the other hand also felt that they could swamp Hindus by means of their overwhelming numbers.
('93', 203, 5, 15, 412372) But he had no doubt about it that both of them were not only injuring their own communities but also acting against the interests of India as a whole.
('93', 203, 6, 16, 412523) Concluding, Gandhiji prayed to God that he might be successful in cementing differences between the two communities which had unhappily been estranged from one another and said that in this great experiment he would like to march all alone with God as his sole guide.

('93', 205, 3, 4, 414264) MY DEAR PRAKASAM 1, I have now your letter enclosing papers.
('93', 205, 3, 5, 414325) I hope you have my reply to your telegram, copy of which is enclosed herewith.
('93', 205, 3, 6, 414404) I have nothing to add to what I have said.
('93', 205, 3, 7, 414447) I regard Central Governments reply as a challenge to your faith in yourself, the charkha and the dumb masses of Madras.
('93', 205, 3, 8, 414567) If the latter are really with you, as I hope they are, you can accept the challenge 2 and you will benefit not only Madras but the whole of Indian humanity.

('93', 205, 13, 25, 415186) Introducing Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Gandhiji said that he was one of the two Rashtrapatis present.
('93', 205, 13, 26, 415286) Panditji occupied the position of Vice President in the
('93', 205, 14, 27, 415342) 1 Premier, Madras province 2 The reference is to the Madras Governments khadi scheme and the Premiers announcement that no new textile mills would be started in the Madras province.
('93', 205, 14, 28, 415524) The scheme had met with criticism from many quarters.

('93', 206, 1, 3, 415675) The other, namely, Acharya Kripalani, was now at the head of the Indian National Congress.
('93', 206, 1, 4, 415766) The former was at the helm by virtue of Government office.
('93', 206, 1, 5, 415825) The latter had nothing but moral authority.
('93', 206, 1, 6, 415869) Mr. Shankarrao Deo, the present General Secretary, and Miss Mridula Sarabhai, the outgoing one, were also in their midst.
('93', 206, 1, 7, 415991) All the four were servants of the Indian National Congress and through it of the nation.
('93', 206, 2, 8, 416080) There were some who described the Congress as a Hindu organization.
('93', 206, 2, 9, 416148) They only betrayed their ignorance of the political history of India.
('93', 206, 2, 10, 416218) At one time the Hindu Mahasabha was in the hands of the Congress and so was the Muslim League and others.
('93', 206, 2, 11, 416324) 1 Congress was not a Hindu organization.
('93', 206, 2, 12, 416365) It did not serve Hindu interests to the exclusion of the other communities.
('93', 206, 3, 13, 416441) It was hinted that the Congress leaders had come to consult him with regard to the interests of the Hindus.
('93', 206, 3, 14, 416549) Had they done so they would have lowered the stature of the Indian National Congress in the eyes of the world.
('93', 206, 3, 15, 416660) They had come to consult him, as an expert on the Hindu Muslim question, as to how best to serve the national cause in the present crisis.
('93', 206, 3, 16, 416799) The reins of Government had come in the hands of the peoples representatives; the nation was well on the way to independence, but it had yet to be achieved.
('93', 206, 3, 17, 416956) It was sure to come if we made wise use of our strength.
('93', 206, 3, 18, 417013) The leaders were determined to do without British aid in solving our problems.
('93', 206, 3, 19, 417092) One single step might injure the national cause.
('93', 206, 4, 20, 417141) On the previous evening, the speaker added, he had said 2 something about Suhrawardy Saheb.
('93', 206, 4, 21, 417233) If the people respected democracy, they could not disregard the Ministry.
('93', 206, 4, 22, 417307) If anyone wished to serve the afflicted people of Bengal then nothing should be done without the knowledge and sanction of the Ministry.
('93', 206, 5, 23, 417444) There should be no mental reservation.
('93', 206, 6, 24, 417483) Gandhiji concluded by saying that he had come to prove by his action that he was a sincere friend and a well wisher of the Muslims.
('93', 206, 6, 25, 417615) Restoration of the feeling of amity and brotherhood was his sole concern.

('93', 208, 1, 2, 419205) 278. INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONGRESS WORKING COMMITTEE
('93', 208, 2, 3, 419254) SRIRAMPUR, [December 28/30, 1946] 1
('93', 208, 3, 4, 419290) During its unbroken career of sixty years, the Congress has been invariably and progressively representative of all the communities Hindus, Muslims and others.
('93', 208, 3, 5, 419450) It has been also progressively represen tative of the masses.
('93', 208, 3, 6, 419512) That it has always had a number of hypocrites is but an ode to these two among its many virtues.
('93', 208, 3, 7, 419609) If those who repr esent these two virtues are found to be in a hopeless minority, they should lodge their protest and leave the Congress and influence public opinion from outside.
('93', 208, 3, 8, 419789) Then only will they be true servants of the nation.
('93', 208, 3, 9, 419841) Therefore at this critical period I hold it to be necessary for the Working Committee to give the proper, unequivocal lead to the Congress by laying down these propositions : 1.It is now perhaps late to cry off the Constituent Assembly though I still hold it to be the best course to make the Congress position absolutely clear.
('93', 208, 3, 10, 420170) 2.The second best is to accept the Cabinet Missions statement with the joint interpretation of it between themselves and Qaid e Azam Jinnah.
('93', 208, 3, 11, 420311) 3.It must be clearly understood that it is open to any Congress individual or unit to declare his or Groups or Provinces secession from the Congress stand which the Congress should be free to accept whilst still openly guiding the seceding elements.
('93', 208, 3, 12, 420561) This will be in accordance with the Cabinets position that they will not compel any Group or Province.
('93', 208, 3, 13, 420664) The result of this would be that the members of Section A would prepare a full constitution in terms of the Cabinet Missions statement and B and C Sections would have to frame what they can in spite of the seceders, i.e., as at present conceived, Assam in the East and Frontier Province in the West, the Sikhs in the Punjab and may be Baluchistan.
('93', 208, 4, 14, 421012) 1 From My Days with Gandhi, p.
('93', 208, 4, 15, 421043) 128,in which N. K. Bose explains: During these three days the Congress leaders held long discussions with Gandhiji.
('93', 208, 4, 16, 421159) After discussion with the leaders, Gandhiji prepared instructions for the Working Committee.
('93', 208, 4, 17, 421252) This was .
('93', 208, 4, 18, 421263) handed over to Jawaharlal Nehru and others.
('93', 209, 0, 1, 421307) 210 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('93', 209, 1, 2, 421349) It may be that the British Government will recognize or set up another Constituent Assembly.
('93', 209, 1, 3, 421442) If they do, they will damn themselves for ever.
('93', 209, 1, 4, 421490) They are bound when a constitution is framed in terms of the Cabinet Missions stand to leave the rest to fate, every vestige of British authority being wiped out, British soldiers retiring from India never to return.
('93', 209, 1, 5, 421707) This position of the Congress is in no way to be interpreted as playing completely into Qaid e Azam Jinnahs hand.
('93', 209, 1, 6, 421821) And if this he considers to be what he meant, the Congress will be thanked by the world for giving Qaid e Azam Jinnah a universally acceptable and inoffensive formula for his Pakistan.
('93', 209, 1, 7, 422006) The Congress dare not shirk the right thing because it completely coincides with his view.
('93', 209, 1, 8, 422097) The constitution will be for whole India.
('93', 209, 1, 9, 422139) It will have to contain a specific clause showing in what way it will be open to the boycotters to avail themselves of the constitution.

('93', 209, 4, 17, 422827) Somehow or other I feel that my judgment about the communal problems and the political situation is true.
('93', 209, 4, 18, 422933) I have no doubt now about the wisdom of what I had said 4 in Delhi when the Working Committee accepted the Cabinet Missions statement.

('93', 210, 5, 17, 424200) He should collect the money publicly both from Hindus and Muslims.
('93', 210, 5, 18, 424267) I am also getting more convinced from experience that all activities which are carried on with the help of money alone are sure to fail.
('93', 210, 5, 19, 424404) You also should give up any idea of getting things done with money.
('93', 210, 5, 20, 424472) It is essential that .

('93', 210, 6, 31, 425112) The charge that I want to stick to office is a pure concoction.
('93', 210, 6, 32, 425176) I was opposed to Jawaharlals hurling idle threats of resigning from the Interim Government.
('93', 210, 6, 33, 425268) They damage the prestige of the Congress and have a demoralizing effect on the services.
('93', 210, 6, 34, 425357) Not even any Leaguer has said that I insult the League time and again.
('93', 210, 6, 35, 425428) It is my habit to tell people the bitterest truths.
('93', 210, 6, 36, 425480) The remark about meeting the sword by the sword has been torn out of a long passage and presented out of context.
('93', 210, 6, 37, 425594) If any of my colleagues has complained to you about me, I should like to know.

('93', 211, 6, 26, 427046) If Anand 1 gets constant fever, Gordhandas should give up his attachment, or Anand himself should be trained to live with him.
('93', 211, 6, 27, 427173) But I think all this advice is useless.
('93', 211, 6, 28, 427213) What is in store for you will happen
('93', 211, 7, 29, 427250) Blessings from BAPU

('93', 212, 1, 2, 427408) 282. LETTER TO PYARELAL
('93', 212, 2, 3, 427432) December 30, 1946
('93', 212, 3, 4, 427450) PYARELAL, You certainly should have proper food.
('93', 212, 3, 5, 427499) A soldier must keep his body fit.
('93', 212, 3, 6, 427533) You must always keep with you roti or biscuits.
('93', 212, 3, 7, 427581) If you take with it some coconut it makes a complete diet.
('93', 212, 3, 8, 427640) If you add to it some gur it will make a complete diet (I have tried all this).
('93', 212, 3, 9, 427720) So, even while being on the march, it can be eaten at fixed times.
('93', 212, 3, 10, 427787) You will have read in the History of [Satyagraha in] South Africa that during the march to the Transvaal, I ate while walking.
('93', 212, 3, 11, 427914) If you do this you will never have to depend on anyone.
('93', 212, 3, 12, 427970) You can take whatever fruit is locally available.
('93', 212, 3, 13, 428020) You have agreed that you and I should never talk keeping Manu apart.
('93', 212, 3, 14, 428089) You cannot entertain any doubt about her at all.
('93', 212, 3, 15, 428138) Hence I advise you to convey to her the purport of our talk.
('93', 212, 3, 16, 428199) Show this also to her.
('93', 212, 3, 17, 428222) Then whatever bad feelings she may be having will automatically come to the surface.
('93', 212, 3, 18, 428307) Affection can never last till the end.
('93', 212, 3, 19, 428346) It certainly did not last in this case.
('93', 212, 3, 20, 428386) Hence you must be cheerful and confident and inspire in her as much confidence as possible.
('93', 212, 3, 21, 428478) Letting her know of your doubt will be an act of loyalty.
('93', 212, 3, 22, 428536) Then you must do whatever you can without entertaining any doubt.
('93', 212, 3, 23, 428602) God belongs to everyone.
('93', 212, 3, 24, 428627) He will do as He wills.
('93', 212, 3, 25, 428651) I am doing only that.
('93', 212, 3, 26, 428673) I am having her sleep close to me.
('93', 212, 3, 27, 428708) She sleeps naked but sleeps soundly.
('93', 212, 3, 28, 428745) She has to be woken up whenever there is work, be it at 2 oclock or 3 oclock.
('93', 212, 3, 29, 428823) I consider it a very good sign that she is able to sleep like that.
('93', 212, 3, 30, 428891) I have known it since the Aga Khan Palace days that she is quite unself conscious.
('93', 212, 3, 31, 428974) The main thing was that she should be with me, in my care and associate with you and learn.
('93', 212, 3, 32, 429066) That has happened.
('93', 212, 3, 33, 429085) Now we must all wish that only what spontaneously occurs to her will happen.
('93', 212, 3, 34, 429162) Only then will she be completely free from fear.
('93', 212, 3, 35, 429211) That you want to conquer is my own expression.
('93', 212, 3, 36, 429258) You must learn to understand my language.
('93', 212, 3, 37, 429300) The English word conquer is ofno use to me.
('93', 212, 3, 38, 429344) I can never utter the word in that sense.
('93', 212, 3, 39, 429386) The conquest that I am talking about has to be achieved by everyone.
('93', 212, 3, 40, 429455) It is religion.
('93', 212, 3, 41, 429471) We have to conquer untruth by truth, violence by non violence.
('93', 212, 3, 42, 429534) How nice if you could unlearn English reading and English thought !
('93', 212, 3, 43, 429602) What I am asking for is that you narrate to Manu all the incidents you have mentioned.
('93', 212, 3, 44, 429689) It would be nice if you could let me know.
('93', 212, 3, 45, 429732) I should follow it better in the written form.
('93', 212, 3, 46, 429779) This would be an act of service to Manu.
('93', 213, 0, 1, 429820) 214 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('93', 213, 1, 2, 429862) It would never mean betrayal of her.
('93', 213, 1, 3, 429899) For the present we cannot all three of us hope to be together.
('93', 213, 1, 4, 429962) What is possible is that when you come, the three of us may occasionally sit together.
('93', 213, 1, 5, 430049) It is not proper that I would keep you with me right now.
('93', 213, 1, 6, 430107) The present sadhana consists in our being apart.
('93', 213, 1, 7, 430156) The most glaring example of this is Abha.
('93', 213, 1, 8, 430198) Abha has risen thereby and I think she will rise still higher.
('93', 213, 1, 9, 430261) Bapa is happy and looks happy.
('93', 213, 1, 10, 430292) As we absorb ourselves in our work, God will bring us together.
('93', 213, 1, 11, 430356) And even if we have to sacrifice ourselves while being apart, no harm will be done.
('93', 213, 1, 12, 430440) I shall not feel sorry in the least if Amtussalaam passes away while she is fasting.
('93', 213, 1, 13, 430525) She is brave and it seems what she has done now has been after proper thought.
('93', 213, 1, 14, 430604) I agree that you are missing something by being away from me at this time.
('93', 213, 1, 15, 430679) But what you are gaining in the process is much greater.
('93', 213, 1, 16, 430736) Hence, you must know that the time of disappointment is now past.
('93', 213, 1, 17, 430802) I do not think I have anything more to say now.

('93', 213, 6, 25, 431129) I get the impression that you have been terribly disappointed.
('93', 213, 6, 26, 431192) You have not told me everything about Manu.
('93', 213, 6, 27, 431236) You are not even eating properly.
('93', 213, 6, 28, 431270) If you have concealed anything from me for whatever reason, it is all over for me.
('93', 213, 6, 29, 431353) I think there is some misunderstanding.
('93', 213, 6, 30, 431393) Atleast it is clear to you that I have brought Manu for your sake, is it not?

('93', 214, 2, 4, 431777) I am no God.
('93', 214, 2, 5, 431790) I have no doubt that you are telling the unadulterated truth.
('93', 214, 2, 6, 431852) But I am not in a position to compel.
('93', 214, 2, 7, 431890) Had I not believed you why would I have bothered so much ?
('93', 214, 2, 8, 431949) You do not know how much I have talked to her and how much I have tried to persuade her.
('93', 214, 2, 9, 432038) You may speculate but you seem to be having doubts about the propriety of my efforts.
('93', 214, 2, 10, 432124) How can I dispel your doubts ?
('93', 214, 2, 11, 432155) Try to depend on God if you can.

('93', 214, 5, 21, 432564) Do you want to escape from sorrow and commit suicide?
('93', 214, 5, 22, 432618) Your duty is to pray to God and remain calm.
('93', 214, 5, 23, 432663) You had hoped that the fast would cure your cough, but it did not.

('93', 214, 5, 25, 432793) The cough stays because God is absent from your heart.

('93', 217, 1, 6, 435973) Send him a copy of this letter.
('93', 217, 1, 7, 436005) Or do what you think right.
('93', 217, 1, 8, 436033) To write a letter of condolence will mean observing a customary formality.
('93', 217, 1, 9, 436108) I do not wish to do that.
('93', 217, 1, 10, 436134) I only want that both of them should bring honour to Vachharajs memory and wipe the tears of all those in Panchgani who believe themselves widowed; serve them and lighten the burden of their widowhood.
('93', 217, 1, 11, 436336) The passing away of a man widows not only his wife but all those, whom he was serving, for instance, myself.

('93', 217, 1, 13, 436515) It is wholly worthy of you.

('93', 217, 1, 16, 436903) You should certainly go there if you wish to serve everybody without distinction of caste or creed, irrespective of whether he is poor, of a low caste or a Muslim.
('93', 217, 1, 17, 437067) The sanatorium should pay you enough to meet your daily needs.
('93', 217, 1, 18, 437130) I think they should bear that expenditure.
('93', 217, 1, 19, 437173) You may show this whole letter to the proprietor of the sanatorium or anybody else in charge there.
('93', 217, 1, 20, 437273) I hope that all of you are in good spirits and that you enjoy good health.

('93', 218, 4, 9, 438476) SRIRAMPUR, December 31, 1946 If the Hindus and Muslims cannot live side by side in brotherly love in Noakhali, they will not be able to do so over the whole of India, and Pakistan will be the inevitable result.
('93', 218, 4, 10, 438687) India will be divided, and if India is divided she will be lost for ever.
('93', 218, 4, 11, 438761) Therefore, I say that if India is to remain undivided, Hindus and Muslims must live together in brotherly love, not in hostile camps organized either for defensive action or retaliation.
('93', 218, 4, 12, 438948) I am, therefore, opposed to the policy of segreg ation in pockets.
('93', 218, 4, 13, 439015) There is only one way of solving the problem and that is by non violence.
('93', 218, 4, 14, 439089) I know today mine is a cry in the wilderness.
('93', 218, 4, 15, 439135) But I repeat that there is no salvation for India except through the way of truth, non violence, courage and love.
('93', 218, 4, 16, 439250) To demonstrate the efficacy of that way I have come here.
('93', 218, 4, 17, 439308) If Noakhali is lost, India is lost.

('93', 218, 7, 21, 439503) The leaders 2
('93', 218, 8, 22, 439517) did not come for any proposals.
('93', 218, 8, 23, 439549) They had read about my work for Hindu Muslim unity in the newspapers but they wanted to come and see personally how I was working.
('93', 218, 8, 24, 439680) The leaders wanted to avoid what had happened in Noakhali happening in all India and, therefore, they wanted help and advice on how to prevent quarrels among Hindus and Muslims in regard to the

('93', 220, 1, 3, 441629) Today I feel like Trishanku.
('93', 220, 1, 4, 441658) Is it really time for me to retire to the Himalayas?
('93', 220, 1, 5, 441711) Many people have started suggesting this.
('93', 220, 1, 6, 441753) They say it from ignorance but what they say has merit.
('93', 220, 1, 7, 441809) Bihar and Noakhali are of course there.
('93', 220, 1, 8, 441849) I cannot explain to you all this through the written word.
('93', 220, 1, 9, 441908) I can do so only when we meet and talk.
('93', 220, 1, 10, 441948) You will admit, wont you, that Malaviyaji was not a brahmachari.
('93', 220, 1, 11, 442013) Where is the need for it? The ideal has never been realized.
('93', 220, 1, 12, 442074) It can only be approached.
('93', 220, 1, 13, 442101) I agree.

('93', 220, 1, 15, 442180) This is no matter for faith.
('93', 220, 1, 16, 442209) Malaviyaji confessed it to me and so did Shraddhanandji.
('93', 220, 1, 17, 442266) In their later years, they had come very close to me.
('93', 220, 1, 18, 442320) I affirm that, if I attain to the state of sthitaprajna today, I should certainly live to 125 years.
('93', 220, 1, 19, 442421) It is not just a matter of faith.
('93', 220, 1, 20, 442455) It is like two and two making four.
('93', 220, 1, 21, 442491) It is a different matter that we do not come across such a man.
('93', 220, 1, 22, 442555) If we attain to that state, it is still possible.
('93', 220, 1, 23, 442605) I am not sure, but I may have added at least three pounds.

('93', 221, 11, 26, 444559) Gandhiji advised them to depend on hand spun yarn from the charkha which would be available at cheaper rates and in any quantity.
('93', 221, 11, 27, 444689) The hand spun yarn he said, suffered from mill competition, but while the latter produced one very low grade and another very fine grade, hand spun yarn could be varied to intricate designs to meet the change of fashion.
('93', 221, 11, 28, 444910) Gandhiji further told them that if they wanted to survive, they must depend on hand spun yarn.
('93', 221, 12, 29, 445005) 1 Renuka Ray 2 Vide also Letter to Amtussalaam, 2 1 1947 3 According to The Hindu, the weavers had sought Gandhijis intervention as they could not get enough mill made yarn to keep the looms going.

('93', 222, 1, 2, 445296) He had suggested that they should be spinners themselves and teach others also to spin.
('93', 222, 1, 3, 445384) When there were enough of such people in the village, there would be no longer any need for dependence on mill yarn.
('93', 222, 1, 4, 445501) In this way they could lay the foundation of real independence to the masses.

('93', 222, 3, 7, 445691) Gandhiji began by saying that his stay in that village had been amply enriched by the abundance of love showered upon him by the members of the household in whose midst he had been living.
('93', 222, 3, 8, 445880) But God had so designed that he had never had the fortune of staying at any one place for a very long time.
('93', 222, 3, 9, 445988) His travels had now been crowded by experiences both bitter and sweet.
('93', 222, 3, 10, 446059) He added that the people were requesting him to prolong his stay in this village because they said that they were gaining courage by his continued presence in their midst.
('93', 222, 4, 11, 446231) As a matter of fact both contact and separation were normal parts of a mans life.
('93', 222, 4, 12, 446313) So the daily prayer of the Ashramites was that God should give them strength enough to pass through lifes varying experiences in a state of equipoise.
('93', 222, 4, 13, 446464) Verses from the second chapter of the Gita which were recited every evening described the characteristics of the man who had actually attained that mental state.
('93', 222, 4, 14, 446626) Its appeal was not to men of any particular status or calibre alone, but the lesson was of universal significance.
('93', 222, 5, 15, 446741) That he was going to leave the village of Srirampur on the following morning was because his duty now called him away from that place.
('93', 222, 5, 16, 446876) He had now to roam from one village to another in order to contact people in their homes and carry the message of love and friendship to them.
('93', 222, 5, 17, 447019) On other occasions, such as that of Dandi march, he had been followed by lakhs of people, but this time he would be going alone.
('93', 222, 5, 18, 447148) It was his hearts prayer that when he left any place, people should be able to say of him that now one had left them who was their friend and not an enemy.
('93', 222, 6, 19, 447304) Today was the New Years Day for the Christians.
('93', 222, 6, 20, 447352) It was curious that they celebrated this day in India with more enthusiasm than they did the coming of Samvat or Hijra era.
('93', 222, 6, 21, 447476) That was due to their long association with the ruling class who were Christians by faith.
('93', 222, 7, 22, 447567) But as he looked upon all religions as equal, being derived from one source, there was no harm in observing the Christian New Years Day.
('93', 222, 7, 23, 447704) At first Gandhijis idea was that he would give them a reading of two choice sayings from Prophet Mohammad.
('93', 222, 7, 24, 447811) But later he changed his mind and thought of presenting portions from Christian hymns which had been collected and presented to him by Rajkumari Amrit Kaur.

('93', 223, 1, 2, 448010) There was another matter which had exercised his mind for some time past.
('93', 223, 1, 3, 448084) Friends, he added were friends only when they helped a person to progress in life.
('93', 223, 1, 4, 448167) If they discovered any faults in him, it was their clear duty to acquaint him with them so that he might be able to correct himself.
('93', 223, 1, 5, 448300) But this had to be done in a sweet manner and with a spirit of helpfulness.
('93', 223, 2, 6, 448376) It was the beginning of the New Year and his prayer was that the audience and he might be ushered into it free from impurities of the lower self, and thus rendered fitter instruments of service to a common cause.

('93', 224, 4, 12, 450772) DAUGHTER AMTUL SALAAM, I had your letter read out to me.
('93', 224, 4, 13, 450829) I am dictating this letter with a mud pack on my eyes.
('93', 224, 4, 14, 450884) What I sent to you serves exactly the same purpose as anti phlogistine.
('93', 224, 4, 15, 450956) It must be applied well.
('93', 224, 4, 16, 450981) I had only one tin of imported anti phlogistine, which I sent to you.
('93', 224, 4, 17, 451051) You must still be having the earth which I sent to you.
('93', 224, 4, 18, 451107) Use it.
('93', 224, 4, 19, 451115) Today I have come to Abhas village.
('93', 224, 4, 20, 451151) I hope I shall not have to go right up to that place.
('93', 224, 4, 21, 451205) It is very good that you drink water.
('93', 224, 4, 22, 451243) If you have to take an enema, you should take it with someones help.
('93', 224, 4, 23, 451312) You need not, if the bowels move naturally.
('93', 224, 4, 24, 451356) If you feel heaviness in the head, use a mud pack, just as I am lying now with a mud pack [on the eyes].
('93', 224, 4, 25, 451461) This cures heaviness of the head.
('93', 224, 4, 26, 451495) In the same way it would be good if you applied a mud pack on the stomach also.
('93', 224, 4, 27, 451575) If you feel cold, keep a hot water bottle in the bed.
('93', 224, 4, 28, 451629) Ramanama, of course, does everything, but it should come from the heart.
('93', 224, 4, 29, 451702) Then nothing else is needed.
('93', 224, 4, 30, 451731) Whether the person who helps you with the enema is a man or a woman, it should make, and I am sure it will make, no difference to you at all.
('93', 224, 4, 31, 451873) As for mytour, it will really begin after three or four days.
('93', 224, 4, 32, 451935) Satis Babu has brought me to Chandipur for five or six days before the tour begins.

('93', 225, 1, 2, 452122) 305. SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING 1
('93', 225, 2, 3, 452154) CHANDIPUR, January 2, 1947
('93', 225, 3, 4, 452181) Gandhiji said that his mission was for the establishment of friendship between the sister communities living here and not to organize any one community against the rest.
('93', 225, 3, 5, 452351) So far the non violence which had been practised was the non violence of the weak but the new experiment in which he had been engaged here was the non violence of the strong.
('93', 225, 3, 6, 452526) If it were to be successful, it should succeed in creating a moral atmosphere helpful to both the communities around him.
('93', 225, 3, 7, 452648) Only when the Hindus and Muslims shed their fear and mutual suspicion could real unity of heart come.
('93', 225, 3, 8, 452750) There should not be any cause for hostility when their hearts were one.
('93', 225, 4, 9, 452822) Referring to the task of village reorganization, Gandhiji said that East Bengal was a land of gold but unfortunately the life of the people was not as it should be.
('93', 225, 4, 10, 452987) The water in the tanks was so dirty that he could not dare even wash his hands in them.
('93', 225, 4, 11, 453075) The villages were also unclean.
('93', 225, 4, 12, 453107) The rich were growing richer and the poor were getting poorer.
('93', 225, 4, 13, 453170) That was not forced upon them by nature.
('93', 225, 4, 14, 453211) That was a Satanic state of affairs.
('93', 225, 4, 15, 453248) But although the social arrangements were Satanic, individuals were not so.
('93', 225, 4, 16, 453324) Individuals should raise their organization and shape it according to new ideas of equality and comradeship.
('93', 225, 5, 17, 453433) Gandhiji pointed out that the rule that they were going to establish in India in the near future should be free from defects which marked the old system.
('93', 225, 5, 18, 453587) Hindus and Muslims today found themselves estranged from one another here, but if both of them devoted themselves to the noble task of reorganizing the village life and improving their economic conditions through development of their cottage industries, they would find themselves working in a common task and unity would grow among them.
('93', 225, 6, 19, 453926) Workers who had been sent here by Satis Babu, Gandhiji said, had faced many dangers.
('93', 225, 6, 20, 454011) Gandhijis advice to all workers was that they should shed fear of death from their hearts and try to win over those who opposed them.
('93', 225, 6, 21, 454145) In that attempt some might die, but Gandhiji had the faith that however impossible it might appear, the oppressors heart would surely be touched if love and courage from their side was of an unfailing character.
('93', 225, 7, 22, 454357) To workers as well as to villagers Gandhiji would like to say that they should render a proper account of every single minute of their life.
('93', 225, 7, 23, 454498) They should devote all their time to selfless service of common humanity.
('93', 225, 8, 24, 454572) Gandhiji, continuing, said that he would personally like to live for 125 years,

('93', 226, 8, 13, 455511) CHHOTUBHAI, I got both your letters.
('93', 226, 8, 14, 455548) I have formed a high opinion of Shivabhai.
('93', 226, 8, 15, 455591) If I feel that I shall be staying fairly steadily at one place, I shall be able to utilize the services of many persons like him.
('93', 226, 8, 16, 455721) It will be a pleasure to do so.
('93', 226, 8, 17, 455753) What you sayabout cultivating fearlessness may be realistic, but it does not become you.
('93', 226, 8, 18, 455842) If known criminals are going about at large, people must learn to cultivate fearlessness.
('93', 226, 8, 19, 455932) We shall remain mere animals till we digest this teaching.
('93', 226, 8, 20, 455991) Forget about violence and non violence in this matter.
('93', 226, 8, 21, 456046) Let those who believe in violence use the violence of the brave and die.
('93', 226, 8, 22, 456119) Those who believe in non violence will be able to demonstrate its power only in situations like the present one.
('93', 226, 8, 23, 456232) By describing the non violence of cowards as genuine non violence, we bring discredit on the latter.
('93', 226, 8, 24, 456333) It would be more correct to describe it as a device of the coward.
('93', 226, 8, 25, 456400) We learnt the trick and that is why I have begun to feel a doubt about myself, whether all that
('93', 226, 9, 26, 456496) 1 Pyarelal explains: On the day of his departure from Srirampur, Gandhiji woke up at 2 a.m.
('93', 226, 9, 27, 456588) once more to ask himself the question: Why does it not work?.
('93', 226, 9, 28, 456650) He woke up Manu, too, and told her to remain alert and wide awake all the time in view of the ordeal that lay ahead of them.
('93', 226, 9, 29, 456775) Referring to the atmosphere around him, he muttered to himself: There must be some serious flaw deep down in me which I am unable to discover.
('93', 226, 9, 30, 456918) Where could I have missed my way?
('93', 226, 9, 31, 456952) There must be something terribly lacking in my ahimsa and faith which is responsible for all this.

('93', 227, 1, 2, 457093) I have learnt, and taught others to do, is to use a device of the coward.
('93', 227, 1, 3, 457167) I, therefore, have come here to know the measure of my strength and let myself be tested.
('93', 227, 1, 4, 457257) I am accompanied by the police, etc., and now some Sikh brothers also have joined.
('93', 227, 1, 5, 457340) And Nirmal Babu has been here all the time.
('93', 227, 1, 6, 457384) May it be because of them, I wonder, that I go about with a show of fearlessness ?
('93', 227, 1, 7, 457467) That state of mind cannot be affected even in dire circums tances or at the moment of death. This is what Raychandbhai sang and, at the age of 20 or 21, it became my dream to attain such a state.
('93', 227, 1, 8, 457663) I can go on in this strain, but, as the saying is, What need of many words before the wise?
('93', 227, 2, 9, 457755) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] I am sending this letter for your information.

('93', 227, 5, 13, 457938) DEAR DAUGHTER, Last night Satis Babu, Daroga Saheb and others had come.
('93', 227, 5, 14, 458010) Daroga Saheb says that if you postpone your fast for fiftteen days, he will trace the culprit within that time and if the matter is not settled satisfactorily, you may resume your fast.
('93', 227, 5, 15, 458196) I think this is quite fair and if Daroga Saheb gives this in writing, you should give up your fast.
('93', 227, 5, 16, 458296) Later on we shall see.
('93', 227, 5, 17, 458319) If you break the fast, live on fruit juice and glucose for the first two days and after that take milk and water.
('93', 227, 5, 18, 458433) Of late you have become very thin.
('93', 227, 5, 19, 458468) Get yourself restored by constantly keeping Ramanama in the heart and by remaining calm.
('93', 227, 5, 20, 458557) I do not worry at all.
('93', 227, 5, 21, 458580) I remain satisfied by doing what I can from this place.
('93', 227, 5, 22, 458636) Daroga Saheb has said this as a Muslim.
('93', 227, 6, 23, 458676) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] Abha is coming there to serve you.
('93', 227, 6, 24, 458737) Get back your health soon and send her back.
('93', 227, 6, 25, 458782) And it you listen to what Daroga Saheb says, then

('93', 228, 9, 11, 459227) Gandhiji said that women should depend on God and on their own strength and not on others.
('93', 228, 9, 12, 459318) They should be more courageous and should have more confidence in their own strength.
('93', 228, 9, 13, 459404) If they were afraid, they would fall easy victims to the onslaughts of the miscreants.
('93', 228, 9, 14, 459491) Indian women are not abalas.
('93', 228, 9, 15, 459520) They are famous for their heroic deeds of the past, which they did not achieve with the help of the sword, but of character.
('93', 228, 9, 16, 459645) Even today they can help the nation in many ways.
('93', 228, 9, 17, 459695) They can do some useful work by which they can not only help themselves, but also the nation as a whole, thereby taking the country nearer her goal.
('93', 228, 10, 18, 459844) Gandhiji told them that not the men of Noakhali only were responsible for all that had happened, but women too were equally responsible.
('93', 228, 10, 19, 459981) He asked them all to be fearless and have faith in God like Draupadi and Sita of the past.
('93', 228, 11, 20, 460072) Gandhiji also asked them to eschew untouchability.
('93', 228, 11, 21, 460123) He said that if they still went on disowning the untouchables, more sorrow was in store for them.
('93', 228, 11, 22, 460221) He asked the audience to invite a Harijan every day to dine with them.
('93', 228, 11, 23, 460292) If they could not do so, they could call a Harijan before taking a meal and ask him to touch the drinking water or

('93', 229, 1, 3, 460837) This, Gandhiji said, would go a long way to cement the gulf created between different classes of people by artificial caste barriers.
('93', 229, 1, 4, 460971) Unless they did penance for their sins in that way, more calamities and more severe ones would overtake them all.

('93', 229, 3, 7, 461136) CHANDIPUR, January 3, 1947
('93', 229, 4, 8, 461163) Gandhiji began by saying that what he had undertaken was comparable to pilgrimage which people undertook to places like Kashi or Badrinath.
('93', 229, 4, 9, 461303) God did not reside in any particular place to the exclusion of another but in the heart of man.
('93', 229, 4, 10, 461399) If one undertook pilgrimage in the right spirit, one would grow purer and purer.
('93', 229, 5, 11, 461480) What did it matter to them, said Gandhiji, if their house had been burnt and their properties looted so long as they had the will to face any calamity with courage and determination to build up their lives once again on their own labour?
('93', 229, 5, 12, 461718) Refugees should bravely face the reality and learn some craft by which they could maintain their families and earn their bread.
('93', 229, 5, 13, 461846) Gandhiji said that those who did not labour but lived on the toil of others were thieves.
('93', 229, 5, 14, 461936) No man was free from obligation of voluntary labour in order to support himself.
('93', 229, 5, 15, 462017) One might feel tempted to ask what a few individuals could do.
('93', 229, 5, 16, 462080) The speakers answer was that if 40 crores of small bits of wood were tied together, it would be enough to build a bridge over which the mightiest army could pass.
('93', 229, 5, 17, 462243) Similarly, if in India 40 crores of men developed new bonds of sympathy and mutual help, they would be able to build a new life in which every man, woman and child could prosper.
('93', 229, 6, 18, 462422) Fear of hard work and of sudden calamities being thus removed from their hearts, they would march a long way towards freedom.
('93', 229, 6, 19, 462548) If they could shed fear, they would be able to stand up before their assailants.
('93', 229, 7, 20, 462629) Gandhiji added that the fulfilment of his mission would come only when those who were left behind were able to say that now they had got rid of impurities which had been corrupting their lives so far and would go forward to rebuild their own lives on the basis of labour courageously and joyfully undertaken.

('93', 231, 1, 2, 464777) public opinion in the shape of mass opinion I would do this in spite of the manufactured opinion of interested parties and, if the worst happened, I would pay for the spindles of my quota and yet not use them.
('93', 231, 1, 3, 464987) I regard mill owners and Chamber of Commerces opinion to be interested in the sense that they and their supporters have made up their minds that what is good for them is good for the whole of India.
('93', 231, 1, 4, 465186) It is not a question of honesty and dishonesty, it is a question pure and simple of conflict of ideals.
('93', 231, 1, 5, 465290) Of course, it is open to these gentlemen to retort that in my sense the opinion of the masses may also be called interested.
('93', 231, 1, 6, 465415) If such be the argument I would hold that the interest of the masses as conceived by them must prevail over that of the classes.
('93', 231, 1, 7, 465544) It is conceivable that in certain cases the opinion of the classes may be intrinsically right and that of the masses intrinsically absurd.
('93', 231, 1, 8, 465683) This to my mind is the crux of democracy.
('93', 231, 1, 9, 465725) Hence, as the Government, if I am confident about the backing of the masses, I would tell the Centre that my Government would pay damages for breach of contract if that be the legal result.
('93', 231, 1, 10, 465915) I must serve the masses to the best of my ability.
('93', 231, 1, 11, 465966) Jajuji tells me that the scheme you have announced has not been put into operation.

('93', 232, 13, 27, 468131) At the school, Gandhiji enquired as to what subject were taught and especially whether any craft was taught.
('93', 232, 14, 28, 468240) Gandhiji pointed out that he would not like schools to be run on the same old

('93', 233, 1, 3, 468582) The school should ask for a grant for the introduction of crafts and if a grant was not sanctioned, it should carry on without it.
('93', 233, 2, 4, 468713) If the school wanted his advice, Gandhiji said, he would advise Nai Talim (new education) which gives training in crafts.
('93', 233, 2, 5, 468835) The aim of education should be to make the students self supporting.

('93', 233, 5, 8, 469031) January 4, 1947
('93', 233, 6, 9, 469047) QUESTION: What should the Sangh do to appease the aggressive mentality of the majority community?
('93', 233, 7, 10, 469145) ANSWER: Appeasement has become a word of bad odour.
('93', 233, 7, 11, 469197) In no case can there be any appeasement at the cost of honour.
('93', 233, 7, 12, 469260) Real appeasement is to shed all fear and to do what is right at any cost.
('93', 233, 7, 13, 469334) Blood for blood is a played out game and non violence of the brave is the only real approach to the problem.
('93', 233, 8, 14, 469443) In answer to a question whether the refugees should accept monetary assistance from the Government even if it was quite insufficient for the erection of temporary shelter, Gandhiji said: Refugees must honestly find out what they need for the least kind of temporary shelter.
('93', 233, 8, 15, 469718) If their basic requirements are not covered by the proposed Government grants, they should refuse to accept them but should still return to their homes even if it meant no cover over their heads.
('93', 233, 8, 16, 469914) This has to be done in a spirit of sports manship
('93', 233, 9, 17, 469964) Q. In the course of rehabilitation, should the members of the minority community be lodged together in sufficient numbers for the purpose of safety ?
('93', 233, 10, 18, 470114) A. Such concentration of population is an unthinkable pro position.
('93', 233, 10, 19, 470182) It would imply that the whole country would be divided into hostile sections, perhaps enjoying a sort of armed peace.
('93', 233, 10, 20, 470300) The manly thing to do is for every individual, of whatever sect, whether young or old, to derive protection from his inner strength which comes from

('93', 233, 11, 22, 470506) 2 Extracted from Srirampur Diary.
('93', 233, 11, 23, 470540) The Hindu, 6 1 1947, reported that the Gram Seva Sangh was organized by Souren Bose, in accordance with Gandhijis instructions.

('93', 234, 0, 1, 470723) VOL. 93: 7 NOVEMBER, 1946 16 FEBRUARY, 1947 235
('93', 234, 2, 2, 470771) Asked what arrangements for the safety of the refugees could be made in view of the fact that miscreants were moving freely in the affected areas, Gandhiji said: No place in the world today is free from miscreants.
('93', 234, 2, 3, 470986) So villagers should fall back on their own strength for protection.
('93', 234, 2, 4, 471054) The strength which will give them lasting protection is the strength of the heart.
('93', 234, 2, 5, 471137) For those who accepted God as their protector, what did it matter if miscreants roamed about?
('93', 234, 2, 6, 471231) People should do what was right for them and leave the rest to God.
('93', 234, 3, 7, 471299) His immediate advice to the refugees would be that they should brave all risks and come back home.
('93', 234, 3, 8, 471398) It did not matter to him that some might suffer in the attempt due to exposure or shortage of supplies, but the attempt was still worth while.
('93', 234, 4, 9, 471541) Q. If Government and private relief is stopped, what work can we give to the refugees so that they can earn their daily bread?
('93', 234, 5, 10, 471668) A. Although personally I should be tempted to suggest hand spinning as a universal occupation, I would not necessarily do so in the present case.
('93', 234, 5, 11, 471814) Instead, I would suggest that the workers should find out on the basis of detailed local enquiries what occupation could be undertaken in each village.
('93', 234, 5, 12, 471966) And when such information is available, I would love to give advice in greater detail.
('93', 234, 5, 13, 472053) It is certain that the work must be done in co operation.
('93', 234, 6, 14, 472111) Gandhiji said that there were a number of tanks in this part of Bengal but he had not yet seen a single tank sufficiently clean to wash his hands in.
('93', 234, 6, 15, 472261) This villagers were in the habit of using the same tank for all purposes without any scruple whatsoever.
('93', 234, 6, 16, 472366) A clean water supply was the prime necessity of life.
('93', 234, 6, 17, 472420) He suggested there should be natural filters sunk near the tanks and also artificial filters for corporate use.
('93', 234, 6, 18, 472532) Certain tanks could also be reserved for drinking purposes only.
('93', 234, 6, 19, 472597) If no suggestion was found workable, tube wells should be sunk in every village.
('93', 234, 6, 20, 472678) A second alternative would be to have filters in each household made with a number of earthen vessels, set one over another, some of them half filled with charcoal and sand as was done at some big railway stations.
('93', 234, 6, 21, 472893) The third alternative was tube wells.
('93', 234, 6, 22, 472931) He did not favour the last so much as it could not be prescribed for the rich and the poor alike.
('93', 234, 6, 23, 473029) It was, however, all right as an expedient and should be resorted to at once in this area.
('93', 234, 6, 24, 473120) If there were any difficulties with regard to the supply of materials, he would try to help them in securing these from the Government.

('93', 235, 1, 2, 473495) 320. SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING 1
('93', 235, 2, 3, 473527) KAZIRBAZAR, January 4, 1947
('93', 235, 3, 4, 473555) Gandhiji began his speech by stating that the two sister communities had become estranged from one another today and he was even looked upon as enemy number one by some members of the Muslim community.
('93', 235, 3, 5, 473757) His object in confining himself to Noakhali was to test himself.
('93', 235, 3, 6, 473822) In all his long life he had never harboured enmity against Muslim community.
('93', 235, 3, 7, 473899) In fact plenty of the best years of his life had been spent among Muslim friends in South Africa.
('93', 235, 4, 8, 473997) Gandhiji said that it was continually being impressed upon him that his place was no longer in this Province but in Bihar where infinitely worse things were alleged to have taken place.
('93', 235, 4, 9, 474183) The audience should be aware that he had all along been in correspondence with the popular Government in Bihar and all influence possible was being exercised by him over that Government from here; but he did not want to leave Noakhali because his task there was of an entirely different order.
('93', 235, 4, 10, 474477) He had to prove by living among the Mussalmans that he was as much their friend as of the Hindus or any other community.
('93', 235, 4, 11, 474598) This could evidently not be done from a distance or by mere word of mouth.
('93', 235, 5, 12, 474673) A Bihar Minister and several responsible officials who had come to him yesterday had placed before him all the facts within their knowledge without any reservation.
('93', 235, 5, 13, 474838) They had admitted that brutal things had taken place in the course of one fateful week and that they were prepared to bear all justifiable censure passed on them on that account.
('93', 235, 6, 14, 475017) They knew their duty as a responsible Government.
('93', 235, 6, 15, 475067) The charge of complicity or failure in doing all that was humanly possible was denied by them and they said they were prepared to undergo any ordeal in order to prove their innocence.
('93', 235, 6, 16, 475251) They had been trying to answer the charges made by the Muslim League against them.
('93', 235, 6, 17, 475334) Gandhiji said he would like to assure the audience that he would not rest until he was satisfied personally about the Bihar case and had done all that was humanly possible.
('93', 235, 6, 18, 475507) Gandhiji thought that the attendance of both Hindus and Muslims at prayer meetings was dwindling and one day he would be left without anybody to listen to him at all.
('93', 235, 6, 19, 475674) 2 But he said that even then there would be no reason for him to give up

('93', 236, 1, 3, 476198) He would then roam from village to village taking his spinning wheel.
('93', 236, 1, 4, 476268) With him it was an act of service to God.
('93', 236, 1, 5, 476310) Such labour undertaken with an unselfish mind would speak for itself among those who were around him.
('93', 236, 1, 6, 476412) A worker, he said, who travelled from village to village teaching the people how to clean their ponds effectively and teaching them other arts and crafts so as to enrich the life of the villagers, should be able to make the villagers long for his company rather than shun him.
('93', 236, 2, 7, 476689) Continuing, Gandhiji said that news had just reached him that the evacuees were now returning in fair numbers and the question of rehabilitation was becoming more and more acute.
('93', 236, 2, 8, 476868) His advice to the evacuees would be that they should brave all hardships and return home quickly.
('93', 236, 2, 9, 476966) By means of their own labour they must determine to rebuild their homes as well as their own lives.
('93', 236, 2, 10, 477066) Government should extend all necessary help and they should be approached by the evacuees.
('93', 236, 2, 11, 477157) He was aware of the fact that various relief organizations were prepared to help the evacuees with finances and other material assistance.
('93', 236, 2, 12, 477296) But why should they undertake a task which rightly belonged to the Government set up by the people themselves?
('93', 236, 2, 13, 477407) If the Government failed to extend it either quickly enough or to a satisfactory extent, then it was for them to say so and seek supplementary aid of public charities in order to rehabilitate the people.
('93', 236, 2, 14, 477611) But whatever shape these arrangements might take, the evacuees must be prepared to return home in the face of all possible dangers and difficulties.

('93', 237, 7, 11, 478654) CHANDIPUR, January 5, 1947 I have not come here to talk politics.
('93', 237, 8, 12, 478720) His purpose, Gandhiji said, was not to reduce the influence of the Muslim League or to increase that of the Congress, but to speak to the people of the little things about their daily life, things which, if properly attended to, would change the face of the land and create a heaven out of the pitiable conditions in which they were all living today.
('93', 237, 9, 13, 479071) Bengal, said Gandhiji, was a land full of verdure, with plenty of water and fertile soil.
('93', 237, 9, 14, 479161) Nature had showered her abundance on Bengal, but through ignorance, the people were suffering from poverty and disease.
('93', 237, 9, 15, 479281) They appeared to be content with what little could be earned from betel nut and coconut gardens and a little of agriculture.
('93', 237, 9, 16, 479406) But with more knowledge, they could increase the productivity of the land many times and convert their villages into cleaner abodes of peace and pros perity.
('93', 237, 9, 17, 479564) If all the villagers joined together, the face of the land would be changed in no time.
('93', 237, 10, 18, 479652) Referring to the evacuees, Gandhiji said that they must come back home and face all dangers and difficulties.
('93', 237, 10, 19, 479762) Anyone who had committed a sin should likewise make a clean confession to God, and then depend upon God for whatever He might choose to do.
('93', 237, 10, 20, 479902) Truly religious men who made a confession to God did not repeat their errors.
('93', 237, 10, 21, 479980) Gandhiji said that only in the morning he had visited a house where the owner had been assured that if he divulged his secret hoard of gold, his life would be spared.

('93', 238, 1, 3, 480506) No man is free from sin and his advice to the miscreants would be to come forward and depend on God and live like brave honest men

('93', 238, 4, 6, 480714) AS FROM KAZIRKHIL, RAMGUNJ POST, NOAKHALI DISTRICT, CAMP: CHANDIPUR, January [2/6] 1, 1947
('93', 238, 6, 7, 480805) Your registered letter is in front of me.
('93', 238, 6, 8, 480847) The news will be given to you by Parasuram together with this letter.
('93', 238, 6, 9, 480917) I simply dictate to say that the position you adumbrate is the correct thing.
('93', 238, 6, 10, 480995) Everything depends upon ones purity in thought, word and deed, using the word purity in its widest sense.
('93', 238, 6, 11, 481101) Then there may be no cause for even so much as a headache.
('93', 238, 6, 12, 481160) Only get hold of this fundamental fact.
('93', 238, 6, 13, 481200) We often loosely use the word purity and excuse all sorts of lapses.
('93', 238, 6, 14, 481269) Do not ever worry how I am faring or what I am doing here.
('93', 238, 6, 15, 481328) If I succeed in emptying myself utterly, God will possess me.
('93', 238, 6, 16, 481390) Then I know that everything will come true but it is a serious question when I shall have reduced myself to zero.
('93', 238, 6, 17, 481504) Think of I and O in juxtaposition and you have the whole problem of life in two signs.
('93', 238, 6, 18, 481591) In this process you have helped me considerably for, though at a distance, you seem to be doing your duty to the fullest extent possible in your field 2 of work.
('93', 238, 6, 19, 481753) This was dictated four days ago when I was resting in bed.
('93', 238, 6, 20, 481812) But it remained untyped.
('93', 238, 6, 21, 481837) Meantime your another letter and samples of khadi have been received.
('93', 238, 6, 22, 481907) Have you any khadi to spare for sale?
('93', 238, 6, 23, 481945) I make this inquiry for the sake of the refugees.
('93', 238, 6, 24, 481995) Do not overdo things.
('93', 238, 6, 25, 482017) Do not overwork.
('93', 238, 6, 26, 482034) Be careful for nothing. 3
('93', 238, 7, 27, 482060) The pilgrimage on foot commences tomorrow.
('93', 238, 7, 28, 482103) There may be then no letter to you.
('93', 238, 7, 29, 482139) A bulletin will be sent to you.

('93', 239, 6, 7, 482577) DEAR ABDULLAH SAHEB, I have carefully read your letter.
('93', 239, 6, 8, 482633) The answer is obvious.
('93', 239, 6, 9, 482656) My non co operation was purely non violent in conception as also in effect.
('93', 239, 6, 10, 482732) This does not mean that practice was always perfect.
('93', 239, 6, 11, 482785) Theory and practice hardly ever coincide even as Euclids line in practice never coincides with his theoretical definition.
('93', 239, 6, 12, 482908) The non fraternization policy of the Allies led to disastrous results, which he who runs may see and the pity of it is that the disaster is not yet completed.
('93', 239, 6, 13, 483067) No one knows where it will lead to.
('93', 239, 6, 14, 483103) I thought it better to send you the reply of which you may make any use you like.
('93', 239, 6, 15, 483185) But if you prefer that I should send a public letter in answer to your letter used as an anonymous letter, I shall gladly do so.
('93', 239, 6, 16, 483314) I hope you are doing well in your new place.

('93', 239, 10, 22, 483523) PYARELAL, Read the enclosed letter from Nirmal Babu 2, have Sushila read it and then return it.
('93', 239, 10, 23, 483619) I advise you not to come here for the present.
('93', 239, 10, 24, 483666) I have had a long talk with Dev.
('93', 239, 10, 25, 483699) 3 I am taking a lot of work from him.
('93', 239, 10, 26, 483737) He will write more.
('93', 239, 10, 27, 483757) Manu has developed a terrible dislike for things.
('93', 239, 10, 28, 483807) If you come it will only be aggravated.

('93', 240, 0, 1, 483984) VOL. 93: 7 NOVEMBER, 1946 16 FEBRUARY, 1947 241
('93', 240, 1, 2, 484032) Nirmal Babus letter afterwards.
('93', 240, 1, 3, 484064) Manu has lost her equanimity.
('93', 240, 1, 4, 484094) Kishorelals letter has played a great part in it.
('93', 240, 1, 5, 484144) If instead of worshipping her, you worship Godif it is possible for you do that then everything will become easy.
('93', 240, 1, 6, 484258) If you cannot do that, then everything will go awry.
('93', 240, 1, 7, 484311) Maybe even this yajna will come to nothing.
('93', 240, 1, 8, 484355) And if that happens I shall be the main culprit, not any of you.
('93', 240, 1, 9, 484420) But this is all too long to tell.
('93', 240, 1, 10, 484454) I can see that you will not be able to have Manu as wife.
('93', 240, 1, 11, 484512) If God wills otherwise, it is another matter.
('93', 240, 1, 12, 484558) But if you on your own try to accomplish your design, Manu, who is with me, may be lost to you and she will certainly never learn anything from you.
('93', 240, 1, 13, 484707) But if you pray to God to grant her as your wife, you will be able to have her as a pupil.
('93', 240, 1, 14, 484798) This is a hard situation.
('93', 240, 1, 15, 484824) Do what you can.
('93', 240, 1, 16, 484841) I cannot see anything else.
('93', 240, 1, 17, 484869) Dev will write the rest.
('93', 240, 1, 18, 484894) It will be good if you share all this with Sushila.

('93', 242, 2, 4, 487063) Did you get my yesterdays letter 1 ?
('93', 242, 2, 5, 487100) I had written two letters.
('93', 242, 2, 6, 487127) Why do you wish to die in my lap?
('93', 242, 2, 7, 487161) Have you decided to die!
('93', 242, 2, 8, 487186) All this is against dharma.
('93', 242, 2, 9, 487214) I cannot go there specially [to see you].
('93', 242, 2, 10, 487256) I do whatever I can from here.
('93', 242, 2, 11, 487287) You have to die or live as God wills.
('93', 242, 2, 12, 487325) Give up any other thought.
('93', 242, 2, 13, 487352) Your village is also there in my itinerary.

('93', 242, 6, 18, 487542) CHANDIPUR, January 6, 1947 My weekly silence will come to an end at about 7 oclock.
('93', 242, 6, 19, 487626) Therefore, I am writing down whatever I want to say.
('93', 242, 6, 20, 487679) I pray to God that the tour which I begin tomorrow may be duly completed and produce the intended result.
('93', 242, 6, 21, 487785) All of you should join me in this prayer.
('93', 242, 6, 22, 487827) But before offering the prayer you should know why I have undertaken this tour.
('93', 242, 6, 23, 487907) There is only one purpose behind this tour and it is very clear.
('93', 242, 6, 24, 487972) May God cleanse and purify the hearts of Hindus and Muslims and may the people of the two communities give up mistrust and fear of each other.
('93', 242, 6, 25, 488115) All of you should join me in this prayer and say that God is our Lord and may He give us success.
('93', 242, 6, 26, 488213) One may ask, where is the need for a tour to achieve this object?
('93', 242, 6, 27, 488279) How can one whose heart is not pure tell others to be pure?
('93', 242, 6, 28, 488339) How can one who lacks courage, inspire courage in others?
('93', 242, 6, 29, 488397) How can one who is himself fully armed, advise others to give up arms?
('93', 242, 6, 30, 488468) These are all relevant questions, and such questions have also been put to me.
('93', 242, 6, 31, 488547) During this tour I shall try my best to convey to every villager that there is no impurity in my heart at all.
('93', 242, 6, 32, 488658) I can prove all that only when I live and move among those who distrust me.
('93', 242, 6, 33, 488734) The third question is difficult to answer because I myself move under police protection.
('93', 242, 7, 34, 488823) 1 Vide Letter to Amtussalaam, 5 1 1947 2 This appeared under the title Why Walking Tour? with an editorial note that it was written by Gandhiji in Hindustani and rendered into Bengali by N. K. Bose.

('93', 243, 1, 2, 489064) Fully armed police and military personnel are with me.
('93', 243, 1, 3, 489119) They are alert and always respectfully guard me.
('93', 243, 1, 4, 489168) All this is entirely in the hands of the Government.
('93', 243, 1, 5, 489221) Our Government is of the view that it is its duty to provide me police protection during my tour.
('93', 243, 1, 6, 489319) How can I stop this?
('93', 243, 1, 7, 489340) I can only say that none but God is my protector.
('93', 243, 1, 8, 489390) I do not know if you will believe me.
('93', 243, 1, 9, 489428) I am speaking the truth.
('93', 243, 1, 10, 489453) God alone knows a mans heart; none else can know it.
('93', 243, 1, 11, 489506) It is the duty of every believer in God to obey the dictates of his heart.
('93', 243, 1, 12, 489581) It is my claim that I act in this way.
('93', 243, 1, 13, 489620) But the Sikhs have not been deputed by the Government.
('93', 243, 1, 14, 489675) Can I not prevent their accompanying me?
('93', 243, 1, 15, 489716) You should better know that they are also accompanying me on my tour with the permission of the Government.
('93', 243, 1, 16, 489824) They have not come here with the intention to fight.
('93', 243, 1, 17, 489877) They have even left behind their kirpans.
('93', 243, 1, 18, 489919) They have come here to serve the two communities without any discrimination.
('93', 243, 1, 19, 489996) The first lesson of the Indian National Army, which Netaji had formed, was that people belonging to all religions, Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Parsis, etc., should regard India as their own country and should all work in such a way as to bring about unity.
('93', 243, 1, 20, 490254) The Sikhs want to serve both the communities and they wish to do so under my guidance.
('93', 243, 1, 21, 490341) How can I reject such friends, and why should I?
('93', 243, 1, 22, 490390) They are serving because they have vowed to serve and not to show off.
('93', 243, 1, 23, 490461) If I refuse to accept their service, I shall go down in my own estimation and shall prove a coward.
('93', 243, 1, 24, 490561) It is my request to you that you also should trust these brothers of ours and, by treating them as brothers, take advantage of their help.
('93', 243, 1, 25, 490700) They can help a lot; they have a great deal of experience.
('93', 243, 1, 26, 490759) God has given them health and honesty.
('93', 243, 1, 27, 490798) If what I have said about them is proved false, they will go away from here; and if I am keeping them here with any evil intention, I shall myself be doomed and the experiment for which I have come here will fail.
('93', 243, 1, 28, 491012) During this tour, I want to teach you a few essential things, as for example, how to get pure water in the villages, how to keep ourselves clean, how best to utilize the soil from which we have sprung, how to breathe in lifes energy from the infinite sky above our head, how to draw fresh life from our surroundings and how best to use the suns rays.
('93', 243, 1, 29, 491363) Our country has become impoverished.
('93', 243, 1, 30, 491400) I shall try and teach you so that you may, be making proper use of these resources, convert this into a land of gold.
('93', 243, 1, 31, 491518) I pray to God that during this tour I may succeed in performing such service to you.

('93', 244, 2, 6, 491829) God alone knows for how long it will be so.
('93', 244, 2, 7, 491873) It was due to my own folly that I fell sick in Kaira.
('93', 244, 2, 8, 491927) I knew nothing of dietetics and pampered the palate.
('93', 244, 2, 9, 491980) I realize every moment that if I submit to its cravings, it may undo all that I have methodically done till now, whether I eat five items of food or only one.
('93', 244, 2, 10, 492139) Moreover I tell .
('93', 244, 2, 11, 492157) not to worry about me.
('93', 244, 2, 12, 492180) It is enough that one Almighty Physician is above us all to take care of me.
('93', 244, 2, 13, 492257) I had your letter about .
('93', 244, 2, 14, 492283) Dont ask for a reply.
('93', 244, 2, 15, 492305) I do write a few letters but that is because I get up very early.
('93', 244, 2, 16, 492371) I just cannot cope with the work here.
('93', 244, 2, 17, 492410) But I do not worry about that either.
('93', 244, 2, 18, 492448) I am ashamed to admit that though I do get Harijan, I am not able to read it.

('93', 244, 2, 20, 492560) I will certainly speak up whenever I find things going wrong.
('93', 244, 2, 21, 492622) The task here is a difficult one.
('93', 244, 2, 22, 492656) I have to make my way through darkness.
('93', 244, 2, 23, 492696) But one step enough for me.
('93', 244, 2, 24, 492724) All this is just introductory.

('93', 244, 8, 35, 493079) January 7, 1947 I cannot afford the luxury of having a folding hut being carried from place to place for my use during the journey.

('93', 244, 9, 37, 493302) Satis Chandra Das Gupta had put up for Gandhijis accommodation a small, neat looking, comfortable hut .
('93', 244, 9, 38, 493406) made of light, detachable panels of split bamboo, cane and grass.
('93', 244, 9, 39, 493472) But Gandhiji pronounced the hut to be palatial.

('93', 245, 4, 6, 493836) MASIMPUR, January 7, 1947
('93', 245, 5, 7, 493862) People should try to purify themselves and their religion from within and not indulge in outward show, said Mahatma Gandhi.
('93', 245, 6, 8, 493986) Replying to a question regarding the wearing of the sacred thread which, the questioner said, the Arya Samaj wanted every Hindu to wear, Gandhiji said that anyone who liked might wear the sacred thread but there should not be any movement or propaganda in this behalf.
('93', 245, 6, 9, 494255) No good would be done by wearing the sacred thread alone as it could not remove the defects of the Hindu religion.
('93', 245, 7, 10, 494370) Replying to another question as to whether there was difference between his ideals and those of the Arya Samajists, as the latter were telling the people, Gandhiji said there were differences in Arya Samaj itself, as there were several branches of it.
('93', 245, 7, 11, 494622) Some of their ideals tallied with his, but with regard to others he differed from the Arya Samaj.
('93', 245, 7, 12, 494720) For instance, while he had no difference as to ideals with Arya Samajists like Ghanshyam Gupta, Speaker of the Central Provinces Assembly, the same could not be said of every Arya Samajist.
('93', 245, 8, 13, 494910) Asked for his advice as to how people should earn a living, Gandhiji said his advice was spinning for all people.
('93', 245, 8, 14, 495024) He would also suggest weaving and carpentry.
('93', 245, 8, 15, 495069) The people should devote themselves more and more to these professions, thereby leading a pure life.
('93', 245, 9, 16, 495170) Gandhiji again stressed the importance of supply of pure drinking water in every village.

('93', 246, 1, 2, 495413) 336. DISCUSSION WITH A. ZAMAN 1
('93', 246, 2, 3, 495445) January 7, 1947
('93', 246, 3, 4, 495461) Gandhiji said that if people did not accept this grant, namely Rs. 250 per family, Government should step in and build suitable houses without distinction of rich and poor and ask people to live therein.
('93', 246, 3, 5, 495665) These houses must, however, be inspected by a competent engineer.
('93', 246, 3, 6, 495731) No building but huts would do for the present.
('93', 246, 3, 7, 495778) Mr. Zaman said that he had recommended to Government that the amount of loan should be increased to a maximum of Rs. 1,000 and these loans should also be interest free, to be payable in ten equal instalments.
('93', 246, 3, 8, 495987) Moreover, an artisans grant of Rs. 200 should be granted.
('93', 246, 3, 9, 496045) He had also recommended a utensils grant of Rs. 10 for each member of a family with a maximum limit of Rs. 100 to a family, this grant being free for members of a looted family.
('93', 246, 3, 10, 496223) And finally he had recommended a cattle purchase grant of Rs. 250 for every farmer.
('93', 246, 3, 11, 496307) Gandhiji, in his reply, said that he did not see why interest should be charged for these loans.
('93', 246, 3, 12, 496404) He added that If Government did not charge interest it would be very much appreciated by the people.

('93', 246, 4, 14, 496598) January 7, 1947 The displaced persons should be trained to be self reliant in order to maintain themselves and not depend upon charities.
('93', 246, 4, 15, 496736) Some amount in charity will, of course, have to be distributed.
('93', 246, 4, 16, 496800) But total dependence on it will encourage idleness and aversion to earning a living.

('93', 246, 6, 19, 496950) MASIMPUR, January 7, 1947
('93', 246, 7, 20, 496976) Gandhiji said that some Muslims had left the prayer ground.
('93', 246, 7, 21, 497036) On enquiry he had come to learn that they had left because Ramdhun was being sung.
('93', 246, 7, 22, 497119) He was glad that it occurred on the very first day of his pilgrimage.
('93', 246, 7, 23, 497189) It was a matter for deep regret that his

('93', 246, 8, 25, 497324) According to the report, he met Gandhiji in the afternoon regarding the quantum of grant to the refugees about which there was disagreement the different relief organizations and the authorities.
('93', 246, 8, 26, 497520) 2 Congress leader and member of Bengal Legislative Assembly 3 Reports of the speech in the various sources have been collated.
('93', 247, 0, 1, 497647) 248 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('93', 247, 1, 2, 497689) Muslim friends should have been upset at the singing of Ramdhun.
('93', 247, 1, 3, 497754) It indicated the nature of obstacles that must be faced and overcome if the country was to make progress.
('93', 247, 1, 4, 497860) The nature of propaganda carried on here has been such that the Muslims could not even bear to hear Ramdhun sung by Hindu devotees.
('93', 247, 1, 5, 497992) I am sorry because some of my friends had not been able to bear any name of God except Khuda but I am glad because they have had the courage of expressing their dissent openly and plainly.
('93', 247, 1, 6, 498181) This small incident probably gives an inkling of the mentality which had prevailed during the fateful October disturbances in the district.
('93', 247, 1, 7, 498321) I am extremely careful not to wound the susceptibilities of anyone unneces sarily.
('93', 247, 1, 8, 498404) It is essential that my Muslim brethren should realize as also the Hindus that it does not matter by what name God is addressed.
('93', 247, 1, 9, 498533) It is the same Creator whom people worship through many tongues.
('93', 247, 1, 10, 498598) I appeal to the Muslim brethren to assure me of that freedom which is true to the noblest traditions of Islam.
('93', 247, 1, 11, 498709) Even from the Muslim League platforms it has been repeatedly said that in Pakistan there will be full tolerance of the practice of their faiths by the minorities and that they will enjoy freedom of worship equally with the majority.
('93', 247, 2, 12, 498942) Gandhiji observed that Pakistan did not and could not mean that Hindus in Bengal and Sind should give up their religion and follow the practice of the majority community in order not to rouse the latters displeasure.
('93', 247, 2, 13, 499159) God could be approached through namaz as well as Ramdhun and there could not be a quarrel among branches of the same tree.
('93', 247, 3, 14, 499282) Gandhiji said that there was nothing to quarrel over the Hindus, Muslims and Christians.
('93', 247, 3, 15, 499371) When Gandhiji started from Chandipur, it was proposed that all through his way Ramdhun would be sung.
('93', 247, 3, 16, 499473) But he thought better of it lest it displeased the Muslims.
('93', 247, 3, 17, 499533) Although Ramdhun was very dear to him he did not like the idea that his Muslim brothers should think their Hindu brothers to be so arrogant as to march singing Ramdhun because of Gandhijis presence.
('93', 247, 4, 18, 499732) Gandhiji added that he had been very careful in his speeches and deeds not to offend his Muslim brethren.
('93', 247, 4, 19, 499838) He would desist from anything that displaced their sentiments or offended their religion.
('93', 247, 4, 20, 499928) But he could never give up his Ramdhun which brought him so much mental peace.
('93', 247, 4, 21, 500007) He had come to Noakhali to serve all communities, to help them to live together peacefully and in healthy atmosphere.
('93', 247, 4, 22, 500125) Every day during prayer, he not only recited from the Bhagavad Gita but also from the Koran, and religious differences simply did not exist for him.
('93', 247, 5, 23, 500274) He had come to Noakhali, Gandhiji said, to serve Hindus and Muslims alike.
('93', 247, 5, 24, 500349) But he would be helpless if Muslims wanted him to forgo the name of his God in exchange.
('93', 247, 5, 25, 500438) As he did not like to parade his religion, so also he could not forgo his
('93', 248, 0, 1, 500512) VOL. 93: 7 NOVEMBER, 1946 16 FEBRUARY, 1947 249
('93', 248, 1, 2, 500560) religious belief.
('93', 248, 1, 3, 500578) It was the unity of God and religion that he had come to preach.
('93', 248, 1, 4, 500643) He could not give it up, Gandhiji said, so long as he lived.
('93', 248, 2, 5, 500704) Concluding, Gandhiji pleaded for tolerance from the majority community and urged and minority community not to give up reciting Ramdhun in all humility and without any feeling of hostility towards others.
('93', 248, 2, 6, 500909) With proper understanding of each others religion, Gandhiji said, Muslim progress would be repaid and certain.

('93', 248, 5, 9, 501169) JAJUJI, Your letter of December 9 reached me around the 19th.
('93', 248, 5, 10, 501231) Manu read it out to me.
('93', 248, 5, 11, 501255) But it remained unanswered for lack of time.
('93', 248, 5, 12, 501300) In the meanwhile I received another letter yesterdayit is dated December 30and it was also yesterday that I embarked on my walking tour.
('93', 248, 5, 13, 501437) During the tour the correspondence is to be reduced to the minimum.
('93', 248, 5, 14, 501505) For the past few days, I have been waking up daily at 2.30 or 3 in the morning and writing or dictating.
('93', 248, 5, 15, 501610) In no other way can I cope with my work.
('93', 248, 5, 16, 501651) I know that this method of working is wrong but I have no choice.
('93', 248, 5, 17, 501717) If God wishes to save me, He will.
('93', 248, 5, 18, 501752) If I restrict myself to the work here and completely stop letter writing, there will be no need to wake up too early.
('93', 248, 5, 19, 501870) Maybe I shall have to do that.
('93', 248, 5, 20, 501901) Another way is that I should appoint old workers and sit back myself.
('93', 248, 5, 21, 501971) But this seems wrong to me.
('93', 248, 5, 22, 501999) There is no doubt that it was the proper thing to entrust independent work to the old co workers.
('93', 248, 5, 23, 502097) A great deal depends on how much burden Manu can bear.
('93', 248, 5, 24, 502152) Enlisting someone else will go against my resolve.
('93', 248, 5, 25, 502203) Throughout the tour I have to face the conflict between dharma and adharma.
('93', 248, 5, 26, 502279) Manu sleeps in the same bed with me.
('93', 248, 5, 27, 502316) When I get up I wake her up and dictate to her.
('93', 248, 5, 28, 502364) So far she too is pulling along well.
('93', 248, 5, 29, 502402) So much for the backgroundit was necessary to give some, otherwise I could have saved this much time.
('93', 248, 5, 30, 502504) Now I come to the letter of December 9. From the latest I heard about your health from V. Lal it would seem that it is improving.
('93', 248, 5, 31, 502634) Keep up the improvement and remain fully absorbed in your work.
('93', 248, 6, 32, 502698) 1The Hindu report concluded: Towards the close of prayer, a large number of Muslims who had left earlier returned and sat down in silence to hear the Bengali translation of Gandhijis speech.

('93', 249, 1, 2, 502931) My work should not be a hindrance to anyone.
('93', 249, 1, 3, 502976) You may ask me whatever you wish to.
('93', 249, 1, 4, 503013) I am carrying on a pleasant correspondence 1
('93', 249, 2, 5, 503058) with Prakasam about the work in Madras; whatever will be will be.
('93', 249, 2, 6, 503124) I am rendering some help.
('93', 249, 2, 7, 503150) We ourselves will have to act as experts.
('93', 249, 2, 8, 503192) He will not be able to do it.
('93', 249, 2, 9, 503222) What he can see to is that there will be no obstruction from the Government machinery.
('93', 249, 2, 10, 503309) The Textile Commiss ioner it would appear is a competent man.
('93', 249, 2, 11, 503371) The final result is in the hands of God.
('93', 249, 2, 12, 503412) Regarding Saraladevi what I want is that she should be appointed without delay.
('93', 249, 2, 13, 503492) She is a very neat and efficient worker.
('93', 249, 2, 14, 503533) I believe Dastaneji is already carrying on some correspondence with her.
('93', 249, 2, 15, 503606) If I am unable to give a final verdict, obviously the Board of Trustees must do what it deems proper.
('93', 249, 2, 16, 503708) About the Punjab developments I feel that if things reach the point of fighting we should fight.
('93', 249, 2, 17, 503805) But I think the occasion will not arise.
('93', 249, 2, 18, 503846) You should keep writing to Rajkumari.
('93', 249, 2, 19, 503884) If there is an opportunity I shall write something.
('93', 249, 2, 20, 503936) Your second letter is brief.
('93', 249, 2, 21, 503965) There is nothing more to be said about the exhibition in Madras.
('93', 249, 2, 22, 504030) I say this much for the future that if the Provincial Government or the Central Government or even the Congress itself adopts a policy contrary to that of the A. I. S. A., we must follow our khadi policy even at the risk of leaving the Congress.
('93', 249, 2, 23, 504276) There is no doubt that we shall render true service to the Congress and the nation by acting in this manner.
('93', 249, 2, 24, 504385) We are entitled to hold an independent opinion, which means that the public is quite awakened and enlightened regarding our policy.
('93', 249, 3, 25, 504517) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] I have gone through the statement of the A. I. S. A. I got up at 3 oclock, had it read out to me and read some of it myself.
('93', 249, 3, 26, 504668) I am sending a wire today.
('93', 249, 3, 27, 504695) You will have got it.
('93', 249, 3, 28, 504717) I do not think that the statement needs to be revised.
('93', 249, 3, 29, 504772) On the whole it reads well.
('93', 249, 3, 30, 504800) You should regard me as useless for such work till my work here is completed.
('93', 249, 3, 31, 504878) On reading it I was convinced that we should have decentralization as soon as possible.
('93', 249, 3, 32, 504966) I think I did write upon this matter.

('93', 250, 6, 11, 505373) RAJENDRA PRASAD, I have your letter of .
('93', 250, 6, 12, 505414) 1 It is futile to worry.
('93', 250, 6, 13, 505439) Not only I but we all are in the hands of God.
('93', 250, 6, 14, 505486) We shall act as He moves us.
('93', 250, 6, 15, 505515) I cannot have Kanu with me.
('93', 250, 6, 16, 505543) I have given everyone independent work.
('93', 250, 6, 17, 505583) Manu has come of her own accord.
('93', 250, 6, 18, 505616) She was keen to come only to work under me and I agreed to it and she is working with zest.
('93', 250, 6, 19, 505708) She is not as capable as Kanu, but where faith and purity exist talent and strength must follow.
('93', 250, 6, 20, 505805) Manu has to prove this.

('93', 251, 2, 5, 506532) If it is Gods will that we should meet in person while doing our duty, we shall certainly meet.

('93', 251, 4, 13, 507037) But is it just as honourable?
('93', 251, 4, 14, 507067) Show me, please, if such a mean action is suggested anywhere in your Koran.

('93', 252, 1, 2, 507852) When he reached Fatehpur in the morning, Gandhiji said, he had been surrounded by affection all round, and among the messages received were also some from sisters.
('93', 252, 1, 3, 508016) They wanted to present him with sweets specially prepared by them, but Gandhiji had replied that he was hungering not for sweets for the tongue but for sweets for the heart.
('93', 252, 1, 4, 508190) He was grateful for the accommodation offered by the village, that was all that he needed.
('93', 252, 1, 5, 508281) Gandhiji did not want to be a burden on any village through which he was passing.
('93', 252, 1, 6, 508363) His own food was carried along with him while the expenses of the whole party had already been defrayed by loving friends.
('93', 252, 1, 7, 508486) Some Muslim friends had asked him why a feeling of estrangement was growing between the two communities in spite of the able leadership around, more specially in the Congress and the League.
('93', 252, 1, 8, 508677) Gandhiji confessed that it was indeed true that the people in general always followed the lead which came from above.
('93', 252, 1, 9, 508795) Therefore, it was not enough that leadership was able but it was necessary that there was accurate knowledge of the wants of the people.
('93', 252, 1, 10, 508932) For himself he was only trying to depend wholly upon God and work at the task which came naturally to him.
('93', 252, 1, 11, 509039) He commended the same course to everyone.
('93', 252, 1, 12, 509081) Today I am going through the greatest test of my life.
('93', 252, 1, 13, 509136) I am now to find if the road that I follow is really the true road for all people of this country.
('93', 252, 1, 14, 509235) I will not leave Noakhali unless I am assured by members of both communities that they would live like brothers in perfect unity.
('93', 252, 1, 15, 509365) If success does not come to me, I will not go away from Noakhali a defeated man, but would rather die in the achievement of my mission.
('93', 252, 1, 16, 509501) Gandhiji told his audience that some Muslims had come to him to seek his advice as to which was the right road he should ask them to follow.
('93', 252, 1, 17, 509642) He told them that he himself was in darkness and was searching for the right road and unless he found the same, he could not show them that path.
('93', 252, 1, 18, 509788) The road that he was searching today was the road of unity but he could not tell them how to reach that road.
('93', 252, 1, 19, 509898) He wanted them all to pray for success of his mission so that he might show to the country the right road to follow.

('93', 252, 5, 23, 510177) DEAR FRIEND, As you are aware I am on the move from day to day and this is the third day 1. I have had varied experience on the first two days
('93', 252, 6, 24, 510320) 1 Of a village to village walking tour; Vide, Speech at Prayer Meeting, 6 1 1947
('93', 253, 0, 1, 510401) 254 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('93', 253, 1, 2, 510443) which is worth noticing.
('93', 253, 1, 3, 510468) On the first day at Mashimpur at the evening prayer there was Ramdhun as usual.
('93', 253, 1, 4, 510548) The Muslim part of the audience stayed there during the Ramdhun and then some of them withdrew at half past five without saying why they were going.
('93', 253, 1, 5, 510697) I observed that it was not time for evening namaz because the sun was still shining.
('93', 253, 1, 6, 510782) So I asked one of my co workers to enquire why they had gone.
('93', 253, 1, 7, 510844) They quickly replied that they did so because Ramdhun was recited at the meeting.
('93', 253, 1, 8, 510926) I, therefore, spoke about the withdrawal, a report of which you must have seen in the papers.
('93', 253, 2, 9, 511020) Yesterday was a pleasing contract.
('93', 253, 2, 10, 511055) I was accommodated at Fatehpur by Maulvi Ibrahim Sahib in his madressa.
('93', 253, 2, 11, 511127) He and his fellow Muslims were very kind and very attentive.
('93', 253, 2, 12, 511188) The Muslims attended the prayer meeting in large numbers.
('93', 253, 2, 13, 511246) I had enquired beforehand whether they had any objection to the Ramdhun and they said they had none.
('93', 253, 2, 14, 511347) But they would like us to have no tabla or accompaniment because the meeting would be held practically in front of the mosque.
('93', 253, 2, 15, 511474) I at once saw the point and without a murmur told my companion, who was in charge of the tour, not to have any such accompaniment.
('93', 253, 2, 16, 511605) The Muslim part of the audience sat out the whole meeting and Maulana Ibrahim Sahib took part in it and spoke affectionately about the programme.
('93', 253, 2, 17, 511751) Today however, at at Dashpara, I observed that at first a poor Muslim had consented to have me on his farm.
('93', 253, 2, 18, 511859) But later on he recanted and said he would not like to run the risk of the resentment of fellow Muslims.
('93', 253, 2, 19, 511964) And so I am on a plot of ground owned by a Hindu.
('93', 253, 2, 20, 512014) The population in this village is overwhelmingly Muslim, there being 350 Muslim families to sixteen Hindu families.
('93', 253, 2, 21, 512130) I do not mention this by way of complaint.
('93', 253, 2, 22, 512173) I had expected varied experience both pleasant and unplesant.
('93', 253, 2, 23, 512235) I bring this to your notice in order that, if you felt like it, you might use your influence in the direction you must consider right as a man, not as the Chief Minister.
('93', 253, 2, 24, 512406) You will readily do so if you realise that I am engaged on purely a mission of peace and as an equal friend of both the parties.
('93', 253, 2, 25, 512535) I enclose herewith a copy of a statement made by Dr. Varadarajan Pillai.
('93', 253, 2, 26, 512608) It seems to be an extraordinary thing if it is true.
('93', 253, 2, 27, 512661) I have asked Prof.
('93', 253, 2, 28, 512680) Nirmal Kumar Bose, whom of course you know and who is with me, to write to the Magistrate.
('93', 253, 2, 29, 512771) But I felt that I should bring this matter to your notice.

('93', 254, 0, 1, 512871) VOL. 93: 7 NOVEMBER, 1946 16 FEBRUARY, 1947 255
('93', 254, 1, 2, 512919) There are other things that have come under my observation.
('93', 254, 1, 3, 512979) But I am anxious not to tax your energy more than necessary.
('93', 254, 1, 4, 513040) For the time being therefore I forbear.
('93', 254, 1, 5, 513080) One thing more I had forgotten to mention earlier.
('93', 254, 1, 6, 513131) In this village (Dashpara) Muslims told some Hindu friends that all my attempts at bringing about real friendship between the two commu nities must fail so long as I go about fully protected by armed police or military, by whatever name these guards may be called.
('93', 254, 1, 7, 513396) The fright of the military keeps them from coming to me and asking all sorts of questions for the resolution of their doubts.
('93', 254, 1, 8, 513522) I do see some force in their argument.
('93', 254, 1, 9, 513561) There will be none if either community was really brave.
('93', 254, 1, 10, 513618) Unfortunately both lack this very necessary human quality.
('93', 254, 1, 11, 513677) I would, therefore, like you to reconsider the position and if you feel convinced, to withdraw this escort.
('93', 254, 1, 12, 513785) I do not need it.
('93', 254, 1, 13, 513803) I even feel embarrassed and it certainly interferes with my sadhana.
('93', 254, 1, 14, 513872) If you think that a firm and unequivocal written absolution from me will solve your difficulty I would be quite prepared to consider any draft that you may send me for signature.
('93', 254, 1, 15, 514051) Failing that I suggest your making a declaration that on a satisfactory assurance being given to you by the Muslims in the area through which I may pass regarding my safety, you will withdraw the escort.
('93', 254, 1, 16, 514255) If this happens it will be a dignified procedure.
('93', 254, 1, 17, 514305) I will certainly appreciate it and it will produce a good effect all round.
('93', 254, 1, 18, 514381) I hinted at some such thing at the prayer meeting this evening.

('93', 255, 7, 12, 515508) DASPARA, January 9, 1947
('93', 255, 8, 13, 515533) Gandhiji said he had been assured of a large Muslim gathering at Daspara as the village was predominantly Muslim but very few had assembled and he was told that many Muslims had left and that others did not come through fear of the police accompanying him.
('93', 255, 8, 14, 515790) He felt ashamed that even one Muslim should have absented himself due to fear.
('93', 255, 9, 15, 515869) Gandhiji said that at the previous village he had lived in the house of Moulvi Ibrahim and a large number of Muslims were present at the prayer.
('93', 255, 9, 16, 516014) He had always intended that he should live in Muslim houses during his tour in Eastern Bengal.
('93', 255, 9, 17, 516109) His hosts would not have to spend anything as his needs regarding food would previously have been arranged for.
('93', 255, 9, 18, 516221) From his Muslim friends he only wanted shelter.
('93', 255, 10, 19, 516269) He was pained to learn that many people in the village had left as they heard that Gandhiji had with him military and police.
('93', 255, 10, 20, 516395) He would not like to depend on the military or the police for protection but the Bengal Government had decided to give him this protection.
('93', 255, 10, 21, 516535) After all who could protect him if he fell ill or was otherwise to die.
('93', 255, 10, 22, 516607) Only God could give real protection.
('93', 255, 10, 23, 516644) Innocent people need have no fear.
('93', 255, 10, 24, 516679) If people had done anything wrong they should repent before God and pray for His forgiveness.
('93', 255, 11, 25, 516773) One who is afraid of God should shed all fear of man.
('93', 255, 12, 26, 516827) 1 The report said that Krishna Kumar Chatterjee met Gandhiji in the afternoon, after his recent visit from London where he had fasted for five days for a declaration of Indias independence.
('93', 255, 12, 27, 517017) 2 The meeting was held in the compound of the local school.
('93', 255, 12, 28, 517077) 3 What follows is from Amrita Bazar Patrika, 20 1 1947.

('93', 256, 1, 2, 517181) who are guilty must take refuge in God.
('93', 256, 1, 3, 517221) No man on earth can say of himself that he has never erred in life.
('93', 256, 1, 4, 517289) It is only when one realizes ones mistakes, makes a clear confession of all ones crimes before God and takes a solemn pledge that one will not repeat them that one may expect mercy from God.
('93', 256, 1, 5, 517480) But in any case, the sinner should humbly stand before God and be prepared to accept whatever punishment He may bestow.
('93', 256, 1, 6, 517600) I would suggest one course to Muslim friends assembled here.
('93', 256, 1, 7, 517661) You must tell the Bengal Government, which is guided by public opinion, that my tour of the villages in the district means no harm to anyone and that I should be taken at my word.
('93', 256, 1, 8, 517841) You must assure the Government that you could not possibly do any harm to a sojourner in your midst and that you regard it as an affront that the Government should fear any mischief on the part of the local Muslims and decide to send an escort for me.
('93', 256, 1, 9, 518093) If you write in that vein to the Ministry, then my own request 1 to the same quarter to withdraw military protection from me is likely to be entertained.

('93', 257, 3, 5, 519321) The education of children will be disturbed, but that seems to me inevitable.
('93', 257, 3, 6, 519399) I had a letter from Sushila, too.
('93', 257, 3, 7, 519433) I therefore, think, that she will start at the earliest.
('93', 257, 3, 8, 519490) You should now wait for her and put up with the hardships till she arrives.
('93', 257, 3, 9, 519566) It is no use at all worrying about me.
('93', 257, 3, 10, 519605) God is taking the utmost care of me and protecting me.
('93', 257, 3, 11, 519660) These days I get up daily at 3, and there has been no trouble so far.
('93', 257, 3, 12, 519730) But I feel unhappy that, though I am able to eat my normal food, I cannot attend to all the work.
('93', 257, 3, 13, 519828) However, that problem also will be solved.
('93', 257, 3, 14, 519871) I am now arranging the work with that end in view.
('93', 257, 3, 15, 519922) Do not worry in the least.
('93', 257, 3, 16, 519949) And, moreover, I have so arranged the work that it is desirable to have the fewest possible co workers with me just now.
('93', 257, 3, 17, 520070) Sushila Pai and Sushila Nayyar have been posted separately and are working independently.
('93', 257, 3, 18, 520160) With me are Nirmal Babu and Manu and a person named Ramachandran.
('93', 257, 3, 19, 520226) He works hard but I cannot use him much.
('93', 257, 3, 20, 520267) The man has come to me in distress, and I have kept him because I could not turn him away.
('93', 257, 3, 21, 520358) I had thus planned the work so as to be able to do it with very few workers, and I still adhere to that plan.
('93', 257, 3, 22, 520468) I had, therefore, decided to attend to no outside work.
('93', 257, 3, 23, 520524) But I have not been able to stick to it fully.
('93', 257, 3, 24, 520571) That is why I feel hard pressed for time.
('93', 257, 3, 25, 520613) I am now thinking of forcing myself not to attend to such work.
('93', 257, 3, 26, 520677) If I succeed in that, I shall get enough free time.

('93', 257, 8, 31, 520916) to Manilal.
('93', 257, 8, 32, 520928) You have to prepare yourself for going.
('93', 257, 8, 33, 520968) You are not to worry on my account.
('93', 257, 8, 34, 521004) I will consider it a great achievement if I can do without having to get up at 3 oclock.
('93', 257, 8, 35, 521093) You should be perfectly calm

('93', 258, 1, 3, 521277) And now that Vasant 1 had come over you dont have to worry about Akola.
('93', 258, 1, 4, 521349) It is certainly regrettable that Vasant and Kanti do not wear khadi but can we make all, or even a few, into replicas of ourselves?
('93', 258, 1, 5, 521481) Besides, but for our capacity for self deception the world would come to a standstill.
('93', 258, 1, 6, 521568) We should therefore be more than satisfied if all live according to their own fancies but within certain limits.
('93', 258, 1, 7, 521681) We should be satisfied if both of them preserve their health and participate in voluntary work as much as they can.

('93', 258, 5, 12, 521963) DASPARA, January 10, 1947
('93', 258, 6, 13, 521989) RAMDAS, I got your letter.
('93', 258, 6, 14, 522016) I do believe that you will prove worthy of your responsibility.
('93', 258, 6, 15, 522080) It will be enough if you maintain your health.
('93', 258, 6, 16, 522127) Dont at all worry about me.
('93', 258, 6, 17, 522155) I am not starving.
('93', 258, 6, 18, 522174) I allow myself the necessary facilities and also get them wherever I go.
('93', 258, 6, 19, 522247) Manu has taken up a lot of work and I expect her to take upon herself further responsibilities as the days pass.
('93', 258, 6, 20, 522360) I have asked her to write about her sharing the bed with me.
('93', 258, 6, 21, 522421) I am dictating this letter after getting up at 3 oclock.
('93', 258, 6, 22, 522478) I am also preparing to introduce changes in this programme.
('93', 258, 6, 23, 522538) I am still surrounded by darkness.
('93', 258, 6, 24, 522573) I have no doubt whatever that it indicates a flaw somewhere in my method.
('93', 258, 6, 25, 522647) Take it as though I had confined myself to this place to detect that flaw.
('93', 258, 6, 26, 522722) It must lie somewhere in my practice of ahimsa.
('93', 258, 6, 27, 522770) Could it be that I am nurturing only weakness in the name of non violence!
('93', 258, 6, 28, 522845) Weakness can take a number of forms, but it is meaningless to plunge into a discussion about it.
('93', 258, 6, 29, 522942) That alone is true which we realize by experience.
('93', 258, 6, 30, 522993) You may not therefore bother with it but try to do your own work as best as you can.
('93', 258, 6, 31, 523078) That is enough for me.

('93', 259, 5, 15, 523861) Did you not learn that from Vinoba?
('93', 259, 5, 16, 523897) Learn to do pranayama 3 .

('93', 259, 9, 27, 524521) I have written to Kaka that he can implement his suggestion if the Sardar is fully agreeable to it.

('93', 261, 5, 13, 526807) JAGATPUR, January 10, 1947
('93', 261, 6, 14, 526834) Gandhiji said he had been hearing for some timeand more insistently since yesterdaythat if Muslims asked Hindus to accept Islam if they wanted to save themselves or their property, and if the latter responded, there was no compulsion.
('93', 261, 6, 15, 527069) Gandhiji said he was not concerned for a moment with the truth or otherwise of that statement.
('93', 261, 6, 16, 527164) What he wanted to say was that this was acceptance of Islam under all the threat of force.
('93', 261, 7, 17, 527255) Conversion, Gandhiji held, was made of sterner stuff.
('93', 261, 7, 18, 527309) The statement reminded him of the days when Christian missionaries so called used to buy children in days of famine and bring them up as Christians.
('93', 261, 7, 19, 527458) This was surely no acceptance of Christianity.
('93', 261, 7, 20, 527505) Similarly, acceptance of Islam, to be real and valid, should be wholly voluntary and must be based on proper knowledge of the two faithsones own and the one presented for acceptance.
('93', 261, 7, 21, 527688) Gandhiji could not conceive of the possibility of such acceptance of Islam by the women in front of him or children.
('93', 261, 7, 22, 527805) This was the view Gandhiji had held all his life.
('93', 261, 7, 23, 527855) He did not believe in conversion as an institution.
('93', 261, 7, 24, 527907) He would not ask his friends to accept Hinduism because he happened to be a Hindu.
('93', 261, 7, 25, 527990) Those who came to him with such a mind were recommended proper study of Hinduism and were told to incorporate in their own religion what was considered good in Hinduism.
('93', 261, 7, 26, 528160) He called himself not merely a Hindu but a Christian, a Muslim, a Jew, a Sikh, a Parsee, a Jain or a man of any other sect, meaning thereby that he had absorbed all that was commendable in all other religions and sub religions.
('93', 261, 7, 27, 528388) In this way, he avoided any clash and expanded his own conception of religion.
('93', 261, 8, 28, 528467) What he had said might not commend itself to everybody.
('93', 261, 8, 29, 528523) But he would like every Muslim to consider whether from what he had said it was not possible for them to see that Islam was much superior to what had been described to him during his pilgrimage.
('93', 261, 8, 30, 528718) He had prayerfully studied as much as he could in his busy life of Islams

('93', 262, 1, 3, 529040) Real conversion proceeded from the heart and a heart conversion was impossible without an intelligent grasp of ones own faith and of that recommended for adoption.
('93', 262, 2, 4, 529204) Concluding, Gandhiji said that he was not going to be satisfied without a heart understanding between the two communities and this was not possible unless the Hindus and Muslims were prepared to respect each others religion leaving the process of conversion absolutely free and voluntary.

('93', 265, 5, 10, 533812) LAMCHAR, January 11, 1947
('93', 265, 6, 11, 533838) Gandhiji began his after prayer speech at Lamchar by saying that he would confine himself to a question that had been facing him for the last few days.
('93', 265, 6, 12, 533990) He gathered that a large number of artisans had lost both their homes as well as their instruments of trade which had either been destroyed or stolen.
('93', 265, 6, 13, 534141) What was going to be done about these people?
('93', 265, 7, 14, 534187) There was a time, he said, when our villages had a full complement of artisans serving farmers.
('93', 265, 7, 15, 534283) The latter were the centre of gravity of village economy.
('93', 265, 7, 16, 534341) Payment was then made in kind, and it was in conformity with the needs of the producers, just as production itself was strictly related to the needs of the people.
('93', 265, 7, 17, 534505) Different occupations were knit together by a bond of interdependence into an integrated whole.
('93', 265, 7, 18, 534601) This was Indias village economy in pre British days and in it all communities, including the Mussalmans shared to the fullest extent.
('93', 265, 7, 19, 534735) Under its dispensation, no man could go without food, shelter and clothing in a village.
('93', 265, 8, 20, 534824) But the problem which faced the villagers in this part of the country today was what should be done about the artisans whose life had been dislocated by riots.
('93', 265, 8, 21, 534984) Gandhiji expressed his hope that it would even now be possible to restore village economy to a sufficient extent to cope with the problem of unemployment.
('93', 265, 8, 22, 535139) It was the first duty of the Government to provide the artisans with dwelling houses as well as to supply them with instruments and raw materials needed for plying their trade.
('93', 265, 8, 23, 535316) Cash loans may be arranged; these should be free of interest and the payment spread conveniently over a long term.
('93', 265, 8, 24, 535431) Naturally the question of security should not arise.
('93', 265, 8, 25, 535484) The Government should be prepared to lose their money if any artisans died before full recovery of loans.
('93', 265, 9, 26, 535590) But if the Government did not perform its obvious duty, then moneyed men should come forward for the same purpose.
('93', 265, 9, 27, 535705) They should help the artisans on the same terms as sketched above.
('93', 265, 9, 28, 535772) Indeed, it was their duty to do so.
('93', 265, 9, 29, 535808) The bond of co operation which would thus be created between different classes of population, was a necessary

('93', 266, 2, 3, 536034) He advised the evacuees to brave all hardships and return home quickly.
('93', 266, 2, 4, 536106) By means of their own labour they must be determined to rebuild their ruined homes as well as their lives.

('93', 266, 14, 23, 536937) I decided to write immediately, but could not find the time.
('93', 266, 14, 24, 536998) Meanwhile, Manu read out to me Shanti kumars 5 letter to her.

('93', 267, 6, 20, 538580) But having once taken up a project, one must see it through.

('93', 270, 10, 14, 543006) Gandhijis reply to this was that it was not a question for him to answer.
('93', 270, 10, 15, 543080) The question would be ripe for answer after freedom had been achieved.

('93', 270, 12, 18, 543368) The Hindus and Muslims should remember that they are nourished by the same corn and live under the same sky, quench their thirst by the same water, in calamities that overtake the country are afflicted in the same way, irrespective of their religious beliefs.
('93', 270, 12, 19, 543628) It is very essential that both the communities should bury their differences and live in peace.

('93', 271, 1, 3, 544047) Hinduism has undoubtedly sinned gravely through its custom of untouchability.
('93', 271, 1, 4, 544125) All my life I have struggled for the eradication of that evil.
('93', 271, 1, 5, 544188) But if the Muslims hate the Hindus because they worship the one God by a different name and in a different way, then the Muslims are practising the untouchability which is against the teachings of Islam.
('93', 271, 1, 6, 544392) I am working for the day when the Muslims will be able to say to their Hindu neighbours that it does not matter by what name or in what way they worship God.

('93', 271, 3, 9, 544612) SHAHPUR, Monday, January 13, 1947 You should simply do what duty demands and nothing more.
('93', 271, 3, 10, 544703) If she is obstinate and dies, let her die and be disgraced.
('93', 271, 3, 11, 544763) If she is right and the right is not vindicated in her lifetime, her death will be a fit atonement.
('93', 271, 3, 12, 544863) I shall certainly bring all these things to her notice.

('93', 271, 6, 16, 544993) January 13, 1947 You must bear whatever comes.
('93', 271, 6, 17, 545040) We must accomplish what we have set out to do.
('93', 271, 6, 18, 545087) We must experience everything.
('93', 271, 6, 19, 545118) When we have abandoned all fear, why worry ?
('93', 271, 6, 20, 545163) * * * In my view you must draw comfort from her happiness.
('93', 271, 6, 21, 545222) If you trust her, I consider it your duty to do as she says.
('93', 271, 6, 22, 545283) But if you do not think it is your duty, you should certainly not give up your fast.
('93', 271, 6, 23, 545368) I shall bear everything.
('93', 271, 6, 24, 545393) But Manus case is different.
('93', 271, 6, 25, 545422) This thing is clear to me.
('93', 271, 6, 26, 545449) For the present, your duty is to forget her and be absorbed in
('93', 271, 7, 27, 545512) 1 Gandhiji wrote this on a slip after hearing the addressees report about Amtussalaams fast.
('93', 271, 7, 28, 545605) She, however, broke the fast on January 20. Pyarelal explains : Police officials declared their helplessness in the matter.
('93', 271, 7, 29, 545729) They even accused Amtussalaam of obstinacy and wilfulness in making a major issue out of a trifle. 2 The following notes to Pyarelal, all bearing the same date, were scribbled on separate bits of paper, presumably at different times of the day as it was a silence day for Gandhiji.

('93', 272, 1, 2, 546059) your work.
('93', 272, 1, 3, 546070) And that is the way of winning her.
('93', 272, 1, 4, 546106) Be the result what it may.
('93', 272, 1, 5, 546133) Understand, if you can, that there is no other way of being absorbed in the thought of the loved one.
('93', 272, 1, 6, 546235) * * * This is not something mechanical.
('93', 272, 1, 7, 546275) It should spring from the heart.
('93', 272, 1, 8, 546308) A parrot utters the name of Rama.
('93', 272, 1, 9, 546342) What the parrot does is mechanical and hence useless.
('93', 272, 1, 10, 546396) In the work that I am doing, my work itself is the name of Rama.
('93', 272, 1, 11, 546461) That is how I am proceeding and that alone is correct.
('93', 272, 1, 12, 546516) If you can understand this, give up your fast and feel happy.
('93', 272, 1, 13, 546578) If this is not convincing, then keep the fast.
('93', 272, 1, 14, 546625) * * * You are unable to give up the idea of having her as your wife.
('93', 272, 1, 15, 546694) Whether or not you can give it up only God knows.
('93', 272, 1, 16, 546744) What is to be done when you do not understand what I write ?
('93', 272, 1, 17, 546805) I have compared her to Ramanama.
('93', 272, 1, 18, 546838) We utter the name of Rama to find Rama.
('93', 272, 1, 19, 546878) But we must do His Work to find Him.
('93', 272, 1, 20, 546915) If even now you do not understand, think over it.
('93', 272, 1, 21, 546965) Do not take my time.
('93', 272, 1, 22, 546986) * * * In this way the situation will further deteriorate.
('93', 272, 1, 23, 547044) When did I rebuke you ?
('93', 272, 1, 24, 547068) If you see rebuke in what I said can we go on ?
('93', 272, 1, 25, 547116) I do not even know if she talked to you before or after my suggestion.
('93', 272, 1, 26, 547187) Now from what you say it seems you are beginning to have doubts about her purity.
('93', 272, 1, 27, 547269) You are not able to forget her in spite of my writing so much.
('93', 272, 1, 28, 547332) I appeal to you that even if you cannot forget her leave me out of it.

('93', 275, 9, 19, 551849) Is it not a fact that you, the Governor and the Viceroy are against the appointment of a Commission and that this is sufficient to stop the Chief Minister from appointing one?

('93', 276, 12, 23, 553698) Women, in his opinion, could be as hard as men.
('93', 276, 12, 24, 553746) Could anybody think of Sita or Savitri as less courageous than any man in any country?
('93', 276, 12, 25, 553833) No woman, therefore, should think that she was naturally weak and thus demean herself.

('93', 277, 3, 4, 554054) Gandhiji thanked them and said : If your words come from your heart and not merely from your lips, then their effect will not be confined merely to India but will spread over the whole world.
('93', 277, 4, 5, 554246) They asked what his objection was to the setting up of a separate Muslim State after the events in Bihar.
('93', 277, 4, 6, 554352) Gandhiji replied : If a Muslim State implied freedom to make unfriendly treaties with foreign powers to the detriment of the country, then obviously it cannot be a matter of agreement.
('93', 277, 4, 7, 554537) No one can be asked to sign an agreement granting freedom to another to launch hostilities against himself; it would be suicidal policy.
('93', 277, 5, 8, 554674) On the young men asking whether Gandhiji did not think it advisable to concede Pakistan since it was holding back the issue of Indian independence, Gandhiji said: Only after independence has been won can there be a question of granting Pakistan.
('93', 277, 5, 9, 554920) To reverse the process was to invite foreign help.
('93', 277, 5, 10, 554971) Azadi and Pakistan require the exclusion of all foreign powers.
('93', 277, 5, 11, 555035) Until and unless India is free, there cannot be any other question.
('93', 277, 5, 12, 555103) When you think of establishing Pakistan first you think in terms of getting it with the aid of a third power.
('93', 277, 5, 13, 555213) When I think of the freedom of India, I think in terms of achieving it without any foreign aid, be it Russian, Chinese or any other, but on the basis of our own inner strength.
('93', 277, 5, 14, 555390) Then only will freedom be real and lasting.
('93', 277, 5, 15, 555434) Once freedom is secured for the country as a whole then we can decide about Pakistan or Hindustan.
('93', 277, 6, 16, 555533) Gandhiji was then asked why he should not go to Bihar where the tragedy was on a colossal scale compared to Noakhali.
('93', 277, 6, 17, 555651) His reply was : What has happened in Bihar is shameful enough.
('93', 277, 6, 18, 555714) But the people
('93', 277, 7, 19, 555729) 1According to Amrita Bazar Patrika, as Gandhiji was returning home from his evening walk, a number of Muslim youths joined him and expressed gratification at his work in Noakhali.
('93', 277, 7, 20, 555909) They assured him that nothing that had happened in the past was going to be repeated and that they would stand guarantee for it.
('93', 277, 7, 21, 556038) The reports in the various sources have been collated.

('93', 278, 1, 2, 556141) there are said to have realized their mistake.
('93', 278, 1, 3, 556188) By going there I cannot do anything more than what I can do from here, for I am able to affect the Government and people of Bihar from Noakhali.
('93', 278, 2, 4, 556333) The last question put to Gandhiji was: After the recent disturbances there is neither Pakistan nor peace.
('93', 278, 2, 5, 556439) What is your solution to this situation?
('93', 278, 2, 6, 556480) Gandhiji replied : That is exactly what I am searching for in Noakhali.
('93', 278, 2, 7, 556552) As soon as I discover it the world shall know it.
('93', 278, 3, 8, 556602) While taking leave of Gandhiji the Muslim youths asked for Gandhijis blessings to enable them to fulfil the promise made.
('93', 278, 3, 9, 556724) Gandhiji said that so long as they spoke from their hearts and honestly tried to give effect to their promises, God would be on their side.
('93', 278, 3, 10, 556864) Gandhiji told the youths that they must discuss what he had said with friends and meet him again if they had more questions to ask.

('93', 278, 6, 13, 557103) BHATIALPUR, January 14, 1947 It has been said that Pakistan did not imply curtailment of liberty to practise ones own religion and pursue trade or profession after ones own heart.
('93', 278, 6, 14, 557283) Therefore, it would be wrong on your part to think in terms of boycotting the minorty community and thus making it impossible for them to carry on their normal life.
('93', 278, 7, 15, 557449) Gandhiji further observed that boycott implied intolerance and the assumption of an attitude of superiority by some over others and said : We are sinners because we look down upon Harijans as untouchables.
('93', 278, 7, 16, 557655) But Islam is great because it made no distinction whatever between man and man.
('93', 278, 7, 17, 557735) If, however, you look down upon Hindus because they worship the same God under other names, then you are practising the same untouchability which is definitely a violation of a fundamental principle of Islam.
('93', 278, 8, 18, 557944) The number of Muslims who attended the meeting, Gandhiji said, was not in direct proportion to their population in the locality.
('93', 278, 8, 19, 558073) When women were not afraid of him, he was puzzled why men should be afraid to meet him.
('93', 278, 8, 20, 558161) Islam, Gandhiji emphasized, taught fear of only God and not man.
('93', 278, 8, 21, 558226) One should be afraid to commit sin, but having committed it, one should surrender oneself to God and cheerfully bear any punishment that might be meted out.
('93', 278, 8, 22, 558383) Gandhiji made a passing reference to the purdah system and urged that it should be scrapped.
('93', 278, 8, 23, 558476) The system kept women in complete

('93', 279, 1, 3, 558579) The women of both communities should mix more freely and get to understand each other better.
('93', 279, 2, 4, 558673) Gandhiji repeated his request to the Muslims to write to H. S. Suhrawardy, the Bengal Premier, for withdrawal of Military and Police giving him protection.
('93', 279, 3, 5, 558829) Gandhiji made a reference to his visit to Muslim houses that morning.
('93', 279, 3, 6, 558899) He found that the Muslim women hesitated to come out in his presence.
('93', 279, 3, 7, 558969) He recalled the days of the Ali Brothers.
('93', 279, 3, 8, 559011) At a Muslim womens meeting the Ali Brothers had tied their eyes with a piece of cloth and delivered their lecture but Gandhiji was allowed to address the meeting with open eyes.
('93', 279, 3, 9, 559189) Gandhiji added that real purdah was not of the body but the mind.
('93', 279, 3, 10, 559255) What was needed was real education among women, more so among Muslim women.
('93', 279, 3, 11, 559331) If darkness of their mind was not removed they could not do anything with outward purdah.
('93', 279, 3, 12, 559421) Gandhiji also asked the audience to realize that Khuda and Rama were one, only called by different names.
('93', 279, 3, 13, 559527) He had heard that many Muslims were afraid of punishment and had fled from their homes.
('93', 279, 3, 14, 559615) A true Muslim, he said, should be afraid of sin and not punishment that might be inflicted due to that sin.
('93', 279, 3, 15, 559723) Hindus also must learn that Khuda and Rama were one.
('93', 279, 3, 16, 559776) This was the lesson he would impress upon the audience.

('93', 280, 2, 3, 560871) KAZIRKHIL, RAMGANJ P. S., NOAKHALI DISTT., January 15, 1947 I see from the papers that you are in Bihar exactly as I am in Noakhali, only, if the newspaper reports are correct, you are literally alone.
('93', 280, 2, 4, 561073) My being alone is a fraud.
('93', 280, 2, 5, 561100) Do let me have a line from you about what you are doing.
('93', 280, 2, 6, 561157) I suppose it will be too early to enquire what success you are meeting with.
('93', 280, 2, 7, 561234) Here the task is tough.
('93', 280, 2, 8, 561258) My ahimsa is being weighed on the balance.
('93', 280, 2, 9, 561301) Have I represented throughout life real ahimsa of the brave ?
('93', 280, 2, 10, 561363) If so, it ought to find response from the Muslims at least of Noakhali.
('93', 280, 2, 11, 561435) I cannot give you any forecast yet.
('93', 280, 2, 12, 561471) I am acting as, according to my belief, God guides me from moment to moment.

('93', 281, 3, 4, 562746) DEAR BROTHER, Here is a copy of a telegram received by me.
('93', 281, 3, 5, 562805) I know you are in Calcutta in Dr. Bidhan Roys good and able hands.
('93', 281, 3, 6, 562872) At this time you ought to be spared all the trouble from friends who seek your assistance and advice.
('93', 281, 3, 7, 562974) But I thought that you would perhaps know the facts much more than anybody else and give truer guidance.
('93', 281, 3, 8, 563079) Hence, this trouble.
('93', 281, 3, 9, 563100) I have telegraphed to Jawaharlal, Sardar, the President of the Congress and Dr. Khan Saheb.
('93', 281, 3, 10, 563192) I purposely refrained from sending a wire to you in Calcutta.
('93', 281, 3, 11, 563254) This too will be delivered to you by hand.
('93', 281, 3, 12, 563297) I have seen your statement to the Press about your acceptance of office in the Interim Government.
('93', 281, 3, 13, 563396) It is quite good and I have not the slightest doubt that your presence in the Cabinet will be of great service at this very critical juncture.
('93', 281, 3, 14, 563539) I hope you will make rapid and solid recovery.
('93', 281, 3, 15, 563586) Please do not hurry over the treatment.
('93', 281, 3, 16, 563626) A medical adviser is entitled to consideration from a patient.
('93', 281, 3, 17, 563689) That he happens to be a close friend of the patient should prove no disqualification from title to consideration if only because consideration shown to a medical adviser is really considera tion shown to oneself.
('93', 281, 3, 18, 563902) About movement here I dare say you glance at the newspaper reports of my words at the prayer meetings.
('93', 281, 3, 19, 564005) I have put myself on trial as to whether I am an exponent of true ahimsa or only ahimsa so called.
('93', 281, 3, 20, 564104) I am not relying upon Pyarelal or Sushila for my Urdu work though I see them often enough.
('93', 281, 3, 21, 564195) Pyarelal is with me today, this being the last of the fifth village within his beat.
('93', 281, 3, 22, 564280) If I do not follow this rule, the whole superstructure will come to pieces and the distribution of the party in affected villages will be a mockery.

('93', 282, 8, 13, 565139) Bibi Amtussalaam is in great peace and all attendance needed is being given to her.
('93', 282, 8, 14, 565223) She is calm, cheerful and resigned.
('93', 282, 8, 15, 565259) She does not want the fast to be advertised for her.
('93', 282, 8, 16, 565312) It is a pure spiritual effort and she feels that in the prevalent atmosphere of fear, distrust and suspicion, her invocation of Divine intervention can only be emphasized by readiness for supreme sacrifice.
('93', 282, 8, 17, 565519) This statement has become necessary because of the appe arance in the Press of the news about her fast which can only be terminated happily by the discovery of a weapon which is repor ted to have stood for several murders and all that that discovery means [sic].

('93', 283, 2, 3, 565984) NARAYANPUR, January 15, 1947
('93', 283, 3, 4, 566013) Gandhiji said that it was their primary duty to remove untouchability.
('93', 283, 3, 5, 566084) Unless this virus was removed from their society, there could not be any real progress in this country.
('93', 283, 3, 6, 566188) Secondly Hindu Muslim unity should be effected.
('93', 283, 3, 7, 566236) Both the Hindus and the Muslims should be eager to achieve this end.
('93', 283, 3, 8, 566305) They took water from the same tank and rice from the same paddy fields.
('93', 283, 3, 9, 566377) For the time being, they should forget politics and devote their sole attention to improve villages, spread education, develop industries and other constructive work.
('93', 283, 3, 10, 566544) For this purpose, workers must be prepared to die.
('93', 283, 3, 11, 566595) Replying to a question whether the refugees should now return home, Gandhiji said that they must return home at the earliest.
('93', 283, 3, 12, 566721) They must, however, shed fear.
('93', 283, 3, 13, 566752) Spinning also should form an important part of the duty of the workers.
('93', 283, 3, 14, 566824) If they span at least one hour a day, they could supply yarn to weavers who were now looking up to the Government for such supply for their handlooms.
('93', 283, 3, 15, 566975) The cloth problem would consequently be easier in this way.

('93', 283, 6, 19, 567112) At the beginning of his prayer speech at Narayanpur, Gandhiji expressed his happiness at having been able to spend another night under the roof of a Muslim friend in the course of his walking tour.
('93', 283, 6, 20, 567310) In spite of the fact that he had been trying to reduce the size of his entourage, his efforts in that direction had so far not been very successful.
('93', 283, 6, 21, 567459) And he was glad that his host had proved equal to the occasion and had not been baffled by the size of his party.
('93', 283, 7, 22, 567573) Then Gandhiji referred to an incident that had occurred a short while ago.
('93', 283, 7, 23, 567648) The elders of the house wanted him to meet the zanana ladies.
('93', 283, 7, 24, 567710) He had made an attempt, but without success.
('93', 283, 7, 25, 567755) It was true, he continued, that Hindu women attended the prayer in large numbers.
('93', 283, 7, 26, 567837) In this respect they were more advanced.
('93', 283, 7, 27, 567878) But as such it became their duty to befriend their Muslim sisters and rescue them from the thraldom of the purdah.
('93', 283, 7, 28, 567993) If they neglected this neighbourly duty, there was obviously some defect on their part.
('93', 283, 8, 29, 568081) India, Gandhiji said, was aspiring to be free.
('93', 283, 8, 30, 568128) But if half the population was to remain in a paralysed condition, the type of freedom the people would attain could

('93', 284, 1, 3, 568377) Therefore, with utmost humility, he once more appealed to the elders among the audience to examine the effect of the purdah system and do away with it in the shortest possible time.
('93', 284, 1, 4, 568559) For, in his opinion, the system, as he saw in his peregrination, was quite contrary to what the Prophet had preached.

('93', 284, 13, 20, 569249) Your statements are good and I find no inconsistency in your attitude.
('93', 284, 13, 21, 569320) I have always held that ones wife being really the better half is entitled to full consideration and equal share in all ones underta kings.
('93', 284, 13, 22, 569460) This is specially true in your case.
('93', 284, 13, 23, 569497) I have no doubt that she will share your wish to the fullest extent.

('93', 285, 1, 5, 569898) There will be time enough I expect for an exchange of letters between us and of course Pyarelal will write to you more fully.

('93', 285, 5, 12, 570247) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter which Pyarelal read to me.
('93', 285, 5, 13, 570306) As you know, he and others of my co workers are distributed in the affected villages of Noakhali.
('93', 285, 5, 14, 570404) Therefore, it is not possible for me or him to overtake all the correspondence.
('93', 285, 5, 15, 570484) But your letter could not be ignored.
('93', 285, 5, 16, 570522) Hence, this hurried reply.
('93', 285, 5, 17, 570549) Distance lends enchantment to the scene.
('93', 285, 5, 18, 570590) Let India remain the enchanted island of your imagination.
('93', 285, 5, 19, 570649) I do not think that you need to come to India in order to learn yoga in practice.
('93', 285, 5, 20, 570731) My own Ashram is no exception to the general statement I have made.
('93', 285, 5, 21, 570799) India has its full share of bad men if she has also her share of good men.
('93', 285, 5, 22, 570874) Yoga in India of which you read in books is not much in evidence today.
('93', 285, 5, 23, 570946) What it was like in her palmy days, I do not know.
('93', 285, 5, 24, 570997) Therefore, I cannot encourage you to come to India.
('93', 285, 5, 25, 571049) I would advise you strictly to remain where you are and perfect by practice and discipline the system you have found so attractive.
('93', 285, 5, 26, 571181) The field of service is limitless and I have no doubt whatsoever that it is no less so in Palestine where terrorism appears to be the order of the day.

('93', 287, 1, 2, 572960) 403. SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING 1
('93', 287, 2, 3, 572992) RAMDEBPUR, January 16, 1947
('93', 287, 3, 4, 573020) Gandhiji said that he had received certain questions from some Muslims while he was in Narayanpur yesterday.
('93', 287, 4, 5, 573129) [The first question was :] How could he advise 2 Assam and the Sikhs in the Punjab to stay out of Groups if his aim was Hindu Muslim unity and how, after this, was it possible for the Muslim League to join the Constituent Assembly?
('93', 287, 5, 6, 573361) Gandhiji said there was no if about his aim.
('93', 287, 5, 7, 573406) Hindu Muslim unity had been his aim from his youth upward, that is, for an unbroken period of 60 years.
('93', 287, 5, 8, 573510) He saw no contradiction between his aim and his advice to the people of Assam, the Sikhs and, for that matter, the Frontier and those who felt like it, to stay out of Groups or from the Constituent Assembly.
('93', 287, 5, 9, 573718) The Cabinet Missions Paper was of a voluntary nature and no party could be compelled to join the Constituent Assembly.
('93', 287, 5, 10, 573837) They had no force to back their resolution or wishes except the force of public opinion.
('93', 287, 6, 11, 573926) He had, therefore, given no advice which should make it impossible for the Muslim League to join the Constituent Assembly.
('93', 287, 6, 12, 574049) So far as he had read the resolution passed at the recent A. I. C. C. meeting, 3 the Congress had completely identified itself with the Cabinet Missions Paper.
('93', 287, 7, 13, 574209) Gandhiji hoped that the Muslim League would join the Constituent Assembly in which it was open to it to make good its position by an appeal to reason.
('93', 287, 7, 14, 574360) Otherwise the Constituent Assembly, because it was a voluntary organization brought into being by the only party that had force behind it, was like a house of cards.
('93', 287, 7, 15, 574526) It could only become a solid structure if it was backed by the opinion of the Indian masses.
('93', 287, 7, 16, 574619) Staying out by certain provines or groups could not and should not be a hindrance to the proceedings of the Constituent Assembly, if it was otherwise good.
('93', 287, 8, 17, 574775) Gandhiji would ask: Why should Assam be absorbed in Bengal against its will or the Frontier Province or the Sikhs into the Punjab and Sind?
('93', 287, 8, 18, 574915) The Congress or the League, as the case may be, should make their programme and policy intrinsically attractive so as to appeal to the reason of the recalcitrant Province or Group.
('93', 287, 9, 19, 575096) The second question put to him was: Gandhiji claimed to be a friend of both the communities, but he had been nursing back his own community for the last two months in Noakhali.
('93', 287, 9, 20, 575273) What about the Muslims of Bihar, who have lost their all?
('93', 287, 10, 21, 575331) He would say the question ignored facts.
('93', 287, 10, 22, 575372) He was not nursing back his own

('93', 288, 1, 2, 575558) community.
('93', 288, 1, 3, 575569) He had no community of his own except in the sense that he belonged to all communities.
('93', 288, 1, 4, 575657) His record spoke for itself.
('93', 288, 1, 5, 575686) He freely admitted that he was trying to bring comfort to the Hindus of Noakhali, but not at the expense of the Muslims.
('93', 288, 1, 6, 575807) If there was a sick member in his family and he seemed to attend to the sick member, it surely did not mean that he neglected the others.
('93', 288, 2, 7, 575945) He had had repeated an insistent advice from Muslim friends that his place was more in Bihar, where the Muslims were, in point of numbers, much greater sufferers than the Hindus in Noakhali.
('93', 288, 2, 8, 576136) He was sorry that he had hitherto failed to make his Muslim critics see that he had sufficiently affected the Hindus of Bihar in favour of the Muslim sufferers.
('93', 288, 2, 9, 576297) If he listened to his critics against his own better reason and went to Bihar, it was just likely that he might injure the Muslim cause rather than serve it.
('93', 288, 3, 10, 576455) Thus, for instance, he might not find corroboration for the many charges brought against the Bihar Hindus and the Bihar Government and, in order to be able to make such a declaration, he had accepted the better course, namely, to advise the Bihar Ministry, which had accepted his advice, that they should jointly with the Bengal Government or by themselves, appoint an impartial commission of inquiry.
('93', 288, 4, 11, 576857) [The third question was :] Why cannot the apostle of non violence, the modern Buddha stop internecine war and blood bath in the country?
('93', 288, 5, 12, 576994) Gandhiji, replying to this question, acquitted himself from the charge of being the modern Buddha.
('93', 288, 5, 13, 577093) He was and claimed to be a simple man having extensive experience at his back, but on that account claimed to be no better than any member of the audience.
('93', 288, 5, 14, 577249) He was an equal servant of both the communities or all the communities of India.
('93', 288, 5, 15, 577330) He wished he had the power to stop internecine war and consequent blood bath.
('93', 288, 5, 16, 577408) The Buddha or the prophets that followed him had gone the way they went in order to stop wars.
('93', 288, 5, 17, 577503) The fact that he could not do so was proof positive that he had no superior power at his back.
('93', 288, 5, 18, 577598) It was true that he swore by non violence and so he had come to Noakhali in order to test the power of his non violence.
('93', 288, 5, 19, 577719) As he had repeatedly said ever since his arrival in Bengal, he had no desire to leave Bengal unless both the communities showed by their action that they were like blood brothers living together in perfect peace and amity.
('93', 288, 5, 20, 577942) Gandhiji also dealt with a question that was raised by the Muslim friends who had seen him before the prayer meeting.
('93', 288, 5, 21, 578060) They had asked him how he expected friendly relations between the two communities when the Hindus agitated for the arrest and trial of those who were guilty of murders, arson and loot during the disturbances.
('93', 288, 5, 22, 578269) The speaker confessed that he did not like these complaints.
('93', 288, 5, 23, 578330) But he sympathized with the complainants so long as the wrongdoers avoided arrest and trial and so long as Muslim opinion in Noakhali did not insist upon the guilty parties

('93', 289, 1, 2, 578598) disclosing themselves.
('93', 289, 1, 3, 578621) He would be glad to see Muslim opinion working actively to bring the offenders not before the court of justice but before the court of public opinion.
('93', 289, 1, 4, 578772) Let the offenders show contrition and let them return the looted property.
('93', 289, 1, 5, 578847) Let them also show to those against whom offences were committed that they need fear no molestation, that the days of frenzy were over.
('93', 289, 1, 6, 578983) Muslim public opinion should be such as to guarantee that miscreants would not dare to offend against any individual and only then could Hindus be asked to return safely to their villages.
('93', 289, 1, 7, 579172) The speaker was sure that such purging before the court of public opinion was infinitely superior to a trial before a court of law.
('93', 289, 1, 8, 579304) What was wanted was not vengeance but reformation.

('93', 289, 3, 13, 579655) I got also your telegram yesterday saying that you would be sending a special representative with documents and instructions.
('93', 289, 3, 14, 579781) I shall await them.
('93', 289, 3, 15, 579801) Meanwhile, I have hurriedly read through your Advocate Generals opinion 1. In the place of his signature there is a blank.
('93', 289, 3, 16, 579924) The opinion is very elaborate and instructive.
('93', 289, 3, 17, 579971) Will you, however, tell the Advocate General that it would have been very helpful if he had summarised his conclusions and also if he had framed questions he has answered?
('93', 289, 3, 18, 580143) Better still would have been if you had stated a case for his opinion.
('93', 289, 3, 19, 580214) Then you could have sent to the Press for public information the question and his answers.
('93', 289, 3, 20, 580305) The public would not be interested in the elaborate legal argument with which he has backed his conclusion.

('93', 290, 3, 4, 580893) DEAR HAMIDUDDIN SAHEB, I thank you for your letter of 10th instant received by me only yesterday.
('93', 290, 3, 5, 580991) I understand the cause of delay that took place in replying to my letter.
('93', 290, 3, 6, 581065) I do not propose to enter into any controversy with you.
('93', 290, 3, 7, 581122) But I propose to confine myself to removing misunderstanding that lurks in your letter.
('93', 290, 3, 8, 581210) A statement of mine about the happenings in Noakhali would have been premature, for the impressions formed have been damaging and facts that come to me even now are disturbing, if they are true as at least some of them seem to me to be.
('93', 290, 3, 9, 581447) The volunteers who are working are not under my guidance or discipline.
('93', 290, 3, 10, 581519) Their removal is surely the function of the Government.
('93', 290, 3, 11, 581575) I can only remove those whom I have brought with me.
('93', 290, 3, 12, 581628) I have already told Saheed Saheb that if for any reason whatsoever he finds the presence of anyone of them to be harmful to the country, he has but to serve a notice on them and they will go away without a murmur.
('93', 290, 3, 13, 581842) I have excepted from the category only myself and a grand daughter of mine who is with me.
('93', 290, 3, 14, 581933) Of course I know nothing of the subversive activities of any of the volunteers.
('93', 290, 3, 15, 582013) But if the report received by you is true and I were in your place I would certainly see to it that those responsible for such activities were summarily removed.
('93', 290, 3, 16, 582175) I have no recollection of your having ever suggested to me to get rid of any volunteer.
('93', 290, 3, 17, 582263) I would like you to tell me what I have said in public about the Bihar Government or the report of the Bihar Muslim League.
('93', 290, 3, 18, 582387) I have been most reticent about these things.
('93', 290, 3, 19, 582433) I have certainly entered into correspondence with Saheed Saheb and others.
('93', 290, 3, 20, 582508) But I am not aware of having said much in public.
('93', 290, 3, 21, 582558) I am sorry that I cannot accept your advice about Bihar nor can I endorse your estimate of the situation if I were in Bihar.
('93', 290, 3, 22, 582683) My firm opinion is that I could not do service to the Muslim cause by going to Bihar.
('93', 290, 3, 23, 582769) Immediately I feel that I could, I assure you that I would not

('93', 291, 1, 6, 583254) When we last parted, you left me under the impression that you at least were going to stay in the district and see through the working of the peace committees and you then appeared to be very enthusiastic about all that was happening at the formation of the peace committees.
('93', 291, 1, 7, 583530) Of course I should like you to visit this district again irrespective of whether I still require any explanation.

('93', 291, 6, 20, 584125) He will at least write a couple of lines.
('93', 291, 6, 21, 584167) You must be absolutely calm.
('93', 291, 6, 22, 584196) I shall follow your suggestion as far as I can.
('93', 291, 6, 23, 584244) You say you have sent the books.
('93', 291, 6, 24, 584277) They have not reached me.
('93', 291, 6, 25, 584303) The bearer of the letter did not give me the books.
('93', 291, 6, 26, 584355) I remained in my bed till late in the afternoon.
('93', 291, 6, 27, 584404) More later.
('93', 291, 6, 28, 584416) A lot remains to be said.
('93', 291, 7, 29, 584442) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] I have a long letter from Sushila.
('93', 291, 7, 30, 584503) I want to send it to you.

('93', 292, 6, 10, 585044) PARKOTE, January 17, 1947 What has happened in Noakhali is Gods curse, not only for Bengal but for the whole of India and it is high time that our outlook was changed.
('93', 292, 7, 11, 585212) Gandhiji said that Hindu women should give up the habit of differen tiating between high and low and between caste and caste.
('93', 292, 7, 12, 585338) They should move with all women on a basis of equality.
('93', 292, 7, 13, 585394) In particular Gandhiji advised Hindu women to mix freely with their Muslim sisters.
('93', 292, 7, 14, 585478) If the women of the two communities had been on terms of friendship and if Hindu women were in close touch with their Muslim sisters, much of what happened in Noakhali could have been prevented.
('93', 292, 8, 15, 585673) Gandhiji also advised women in the villages not to waste any of their spare time but to take to spinning and other subsidiary work, such as keeping their villages clean and the water in their tanks pure.
('93', 292, 9, 16, 585877) Gandhiji also said that his advice to the Hindu women applied to the men also and they should move as friends among the Muslims.
('93', 292, 9, 17, 586006) By friendly contact misunderstandings were cleared and chances of quarrels were eliminated.

('93', 292, 11, 21, 586263) Remain non violent and harbour no fear.
('93', 292, 11, 22, 586303) If every one of you sheds fear, then the forty two of you will be as strong as 4200.
('93', 292, 12, 23, 586388) After the talk Gandhiji asked the volunteers whether they were free from fear.

('93', 293, 1, 2, 586509) One of the volunteers said they felt no fearbut only when all forty two of them were together.
('93', 293, 1, 3, 586604) That means that each of you is still possessed by fear, which means that all of you are.
('93', 293, 1, 4, 586693) Volunteers should have no fear even individually.
('93', 293, 1, 5, 586743) Whatever may happen, you should never bow down your heads and succumb to fear and dishonour.
('93', 293, 2, 6, 586836) Gandhiji asked the volunteers to engage themselves in work beneficial to the village.
('93', 293, 2, 7, 586922) They should mix with the Muslims as brothers and friends.
('93', 293, 2, 8, 586980) He deprecated the taking up of the lathi to fight the lathi and said this would never solve the problem.
('93', 293, 2, 9, 587085) He said : You cannot defeat anyone with the help of the lathi, but only with love.
('93', 293, 3, 10, 587168) When the volunteers asked Mahatma Gandhi to give them his blessings, Gandhiji said : You have my blessings, but only if you follow my advice.

('93', 293, 5, 13, 587374) PARKOTE, January 17, 1947
('93', 293, 6, 14, 587400) At Parkote, on the morning of the 17th, Gandhiji had read a speech delivered by the Qaid e Azam on the occasion of the foundation ceremony of a Girls High School by his sister, Miss Fatima Jinnah.
('93', 293, 6, 15, 587597) During the after prayer speech in the evening, he translated a portion of that speech in which Mr. Jinnah was reported to have said that Muslims should develop a high sense of responsibility, justice and integrity.
('93', 293, 6, 16, 587812) Wrong was not to be imitated.
('93', 293, 6, 17, 587842) If after consulting ones conscience one felt that a contemplated action was wrong, one should never do it irrespective of any consideration or influence.
('93', 293, 6, 18, 587996) If people acted up to this rule, no one would be able to prevent them from attaining Pakistan.
('93', 293, 7, 19, 588091) Commenting upon this, Gandhiji said that as there was no question of force here and if Pakistan was going to be established by sterling qualities of character, everybody would welcome such a State, no matter by what name it was called.
('93', 293, 8, 20, 588327) No one could agree, he said, that loot, arson or forcible conversion,

('93', 294, 1, 2, 588553) no matter where committed, could ever be supported by the awakened conscience of man.
('93', 294, 2, 3, 588639) Gandhiji referred to the fact that the celebration was in connection with a girls school and recalled that Mr. Jinnah had advised the Education Minister in Sind to launch a determined drive against illiteracy.
('93', 294, 2, 4, 588849) In this lay the secret of future peace and unity.
('93', 294, 2, 5, 588899) Literary education by itself did not carry one far for there never had been any dearth of literary men.
('93', 294, 2, 6, 589003) What was needed was education for life.
('93', 294, 2, 7, 589043) Men and women, he continued, were two limbs of the social body and if one limb was atrophied then the whole body would suffer in consequence.
('93', 294, 2, 8, 589185) It was, therefore, very unfortunate that our sisters should be left in darkness and ignorance.
('93', 294, 3, 9, 589280) Hindu women joined the prayer in large numbers.
('93', 294, 3, 10, 589328) Why should not Muslim girls, if not women, find it possible to join the prayer?
('93', 294, 3, 11, 589408) The obvious duty of the Hindu sisters, Gandhiji continued, was to go to their Muslim sisters purely in a spirit of service.
('93', 294, 3, 12, 589532) Gandhiji added that they ought to remember Qaid e Azam Jinnahs advice and act up to it; for it was advice not confined to any particular community; it was of universal significance.
('93', 294, 3, 13, 589714) The qualities which he had advised people to develop were not combativeness but a sense of justice and truth; and this implied that whenever justice was at stake, people ought to appeal to reason instead of taking recourse to barbarous methods of settling disputes whether private or public.

('93', 294, 7, 20, 590487) He is such a good man that I have left it open for him to return if ever his mind is clear and he wishes to come back.

('93', 295, 5, 15, 591449) January 18, 1947 Are you not my old tireless correspondent to whom I could carry no conviction?
('93', 295, 5, 16, 591545) You have started with an emphatic statement of opinion without caring to inquire how I am passing my time and telling me on what grounds you have come to a conclusion.
('93', 295, 5, 17, 591713) You have condemned me guilty without even hearing me, the accused.
('93', 295, 5, 18, 591780) You have also laid down the law that Bihar needs my presence more urgently than Noakhali.
('93', 295, 5, 19, 591870) Since I am in a position to know more fully than any other person whether I am wasting my time in Noakhali or not, it is fair for me to assume that your conclusion about Bihar is as erroneous as about Noakhali.
('93', 295, 6, 20, 592081) The second paragraph of your letter is as disappointing as the first.
('93', 295, 6, 21, 592151) You could have no knowledge whatsoever of the information that (the Bihar deputation).
('93', 295, 6, 22, 592238) could have given me and yet you pronounce judgment and say that (they) .
('93', 295, 6, 23, 592311) gave me all wrong information and that Mr. Houlton 5 was party to it.
('93', 295, 6, 24, 592381) So far as I am aware, an impartial commission of inquiry is to be held and if it is, I think it is up to you and me to suspend our judgment.

('93', 298, 2, 3, 596010) BADALKOT, January 18, 1947
('93', 298, 3, 4, 596037) Gandhijis answer was that he did not maintain illusion and never ascribed to himself any superior powers.
('93', 298, 3, 5, 596143) He had met Mr. Jinnah many times, as they knew, and their meetings had been marked by nothing but friendliness.
('93', 298, 3, 6, 596255) Yet the results were negative as they all knew.
('93', 298, 4, 7, 596303) The fact was, continued Gandhiji, that a leader was made by his fol lowers.
('93', 298, 4, 8, 596379) He reflected in a clearer manner the aspirations lying dormant among the masses.
('93', 298, 4, 9, 596460) This was true not only of India but of all the world.
('93', 298, 4, 10, 596514) What he would therefore suggest to both Hindus and Mussalmans was that they should not look to the Muslim League or the Congress or the Hindu Mahasabha for the solution of their daily problems of life.
('93', 298, 4, 11, 596716) For that they should look towards themselves; and if they did that then their desire for neighbourly peace would be reflected by the leaders.
('93', 298, 4, 12, 596858) The political institutions might be left to deal with specifically political questions but how much did they know about the daily needs of individuals?
('93', 298, 4, 13, 597010) If a neighbour was ailing, would they run to the Congress or the League to ask them what should be done?
('93', 298, 4, 14, 597115) That was an unthinkable proposition.
('93', 298, 5, 15, 597152) On the previous evening Gandhiji had quoted Mr. Jinnahs advice that women should rapidly be rescued from illiteracy.
('93', 298, 5, 16, 597269) But Gandhiji said that that was not enough.
('93', 298, 5, 17, 597313) Was the condition of the literate men any better for their literacy?
('93', 298, 5, 18, 597382) Were they not, he asked, subject to the passing fashions of the political world?
('93', 298, 5, 19, 597463) Germany, which had lain so long under Hitler, proved what he meant; as all knew it was in a sorry plight today.
('93', 298, 5, 20, 597575) It was not literacy or learning which made a man, but education for real life.
('93', 298, 5, 21, 597654) What did it matter if they knew everything but did not know how to live as brothers with their neighbours?
('93', 298, 6, 22, 597761) Gandhiji continued that if some people had committed grievous mistakes in their dealings with their neighbours, they should repent and ask God to forgive them.
('93', 298, 6, 23, 597921) If He forgave them but the world did not, even then it did not matter to a man who had learnt to depend on God; such punishment nobly borne served to elevate a man.
('93', 298, 6, 24, 598086) Gandhiji then said that in a book of sayings of the Prophet he had found that a man should never leave an error uncorrected.
('93', 298, 6, 25, 598211) If he did, he would be hauled up on the Day of judgment and find no favour in the eyes of God.
('93', 298, 7, 26, 598306) 1 Extracted from Srirampur Diary.
('93', 298, 7, 27, 598340) The report explains : A short while before prayer the Muslim friend at whose house Gandhiji had halted on his way to Badalkot, approached him and said that if there was a settlement between Mr. Jinnah and him, peace would be established in the country.
('93', 299, 0, 1, 598593) 300 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('93', 299, 1, 2, 598635) It was not enough that they acquired the art of reading, writing, etc.
('93', 299, 1, 3, 598706) It was necessary that they should learn the art of living on friendly terms with their neighbours.
('93', 299, 1, 4, 598805) They should rescue the womenfolk, who formed half their numbers, from the thraldom of ignorance and superstition.
('93', 299, 1, 5, 598919) Men should live in co operation and work for the common good.
('93', 299, 1, 6, 598981) For this, they should not look up to political parties for direction, but to their own souls or God.
('93', 299, 2, 7, 599082) Personally, Gandhiji said, he had addressed himself wholly to that task.
('93', 299, 2, 8, 599155) He would not leave this part of the country alive if the work remained unaccomplished.
('93', 299, 2, 9, 599242) If he succeeded in overcoming the distrust of his Muslim brethren, and in establishing the fact that, after all, it was the daily things of life such as he had mentioned which mattered most, then its effect would be felt not merely in this part of the country but over the whole of India; and as such might even deeply affect the future peace of the world.

('93', 299, 4, 13, 599742) The membership of the Congress should be forty crores, the whole of the population, no matter to what sect, religion or Province or State or the so called independent possessions a particular individual belongs.

('93', 299, 4, 15, 600036) These forty crore member will exercise no privilege by reason of their recognition as such by the Congress.
('93', 299, 4, 16, 600144) The organization will be worked by those who have been habitual wearers of khaddar one year before the date of commen cement, who have renounced untouchability in all its forms and who are not dealers in foreign cloth or intoxicants, who have full belief in the constructive programme of the Congress and who are prepared and willing to do work referred to in schedule A hereto and who have passed a probation period of six months in doing that work.

('93', 301, 9, 21, 603198) ATAKHORA, January 19, 1947
('93', 301, 10, 22, 603225) Whatever I have been trying to say in these days, is contained in the sayings of the Prophet.
('93', 301, 10, 23, 603319) The following passages are therefore culled for your benefit :
('93', 301, 11, 24, 603382) No man is a true believer unless he desireth for his brother that which he desireth for himself.
('93', 301, 12, 25, 603479) He who neither worketh for himself nor for others will not receive the reward of God.
('93', 301, 13, 26, 603565) 1 Extracted from Srirampur Diary.
('93', 301, 13, 27, 603599) Since Gandhiji had started his silence on Sunday, the speech was read out.
('93', 302, 0, 1, 603674) VOL. 93: 7 NOVEMBER, 1946 16 FEBRUARY, 1947 303
('93', 302, 1, 2, 603722) He is not of me, but a rebel at heart who when he speaketh, speaketh falsely, who when he promiseth, breaketh his promises and who when trust is reposed in him, faileth in his trust.
('93', 302, 2, 3, 603905) Muslims are those who perform their trust and fail not in their word and keep their pledge.
('93', 302, 3, 4, 603997) Whoever is kind to His creatures, God is kind to him.
('93', 302, 4, 5, 604051) A perfect Muslim is he from whose tongue and hands mankind is safe.
('93', 302, 5, 6, 604119) The worst of men is a bad learned man and a good learned man is the best.
('93', 302, 6, 7, 604193) When a man committeth adultery iman leaveth him.
('93', 302, 7, 8, 604242) He is not a Momin who commiteth adultery or stealeth, or who drinketh liquor or who plundereth or who embezzleth; beware, beware.
('93', 302, 8, 9, 604372) The most excellent jehad is that for the conquest of self.
('93', 302, 9, 10, 604431) Assist any person oppressed, whether Muslim or non Muslim.
('93', 302, 10, 11, 604490) The manner in which my followers become eunuchs is by fasting and abstinence.
('93', 302, 11, 12, 604568) Women are the twin halves of men.
('93', 302, 12, 13, 604602) Learned are those who practise what they know.
('93', 302, 13, 14, 604649) The most valuable thing in the world is a virtuous woman.
('93', 302, 14, 15, 604707) Give your wife good counsel; if she has goodness in her she will soon take it; leave off idle thinking and do not beat your noble wife like a slave.
('93', 302, 15, 16, 604856) Gandhiji said that certain Muslims had asked him: Who is this Muslim woman Amtussalaam who is fasting at Sirandi? Gandhiji said Amtussalaam had been with him for a long time.
('93', 302, 15, 17, 605031) She was a true Muslim.
('93', 302, 15, 18, 605054) She always had Koran e Sharif with her and she was never without it.
('93', 302, 15, 19, 605123) She also read the Gita.
('93', 302, 15, 20, 605147) After giving her noble family connections, Gandhiji said : But this pious and noble lady is now on the road to death for the cause of Hindu Muslim unity.
('93', 302, 16, 21, 605301) He wished Amtussalaam to be successful in such a great cause.

('93', 303, 2, 3, 605548) January 20, 1947 With God as witness, we solemnly declare that we bear no antagonism towards the Hindus or members of any other community.
('93', 303, 2, 4, 605687) To each one, to whatever faith he might belong, his religion is as dear as Islam is to us.
('93', 303, 2, 5, 605778) There can, therefore, be no question of interference by anybody in the observance of the religious practices of others.
('93', 303, 2, 6, 605898) We understand that Bibi Amtussalaams object is the establishment of Hindu Muslim unity.
('93', 303, 2, 7, 605986) The object is gained by the signing of this pledge.
('93', 303, 2, 8, 606038) We wish, therefore, that she should give up her fast.
('93', 303, 2, 9, 606092) 2 We realize that if we are found to have acted with any mental reservations in this matter we shall have to face a fast on Gandhijis part.
('93', 303, 2, 10, 606232) Our endeavour for the recovery of the remaining sword shall continue.

('93', 303, 4, 12, 606353) 425. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS
('93', 303, 5, 13, 606381) A correspondent writes to me to say that the strained relations between the Hindus and the Muslims bid fair, if timely warning is not taken, to replace Nagari and Urdu scripts with Roman.
('93', 303, 5, 14, 606569) There are undoubtedly protagonists of the Roman as the universal script.
('93', 303, 5, 15, 606642) It seems to me that it would be a great human tragedy if such a result comes about.
('93', 303, 5, 16, 606726) Time saving devices are good up to a certain point.
('93', 303, 5, 17, 606778) But they take the form of a mania when they destroy human relations and desirable restraints.
('93', 303, 5, 18, 606872) I must not tarry to examine what they are.
('93', 303, 5, 19, 606915) Suffice it to say that lovers of the Nagari script, which is scientifically almost perfect, and the Urdu script, which is so graceful, will not be carried away by the lazy craze for the Roman script.
('93', 303, 5, 20, 607115) Would that both the communities will be sane enough to realize that the mutual dislike is not allowed to replace the two Indian scripts.
('93', 303, 5, 21, 607252) But if that happy consummation does not take place, let those few or many who have regard for sacred human understanding assiduously learn both the scripts and thus enrich the Indian national language, Hindustani, as the
('93', 303, 6, 22, 607473) 1 According to Pyarelal, a large gathering of local Muslims had met Gandhiji at Sirandi on the day of his arrival and told him that they had tried their utmost to recover the sword but had failed.
('93', 303, 6, 23, 607670) They had asked what assurance on their part would satisfy Amtussalaam and induce her to give up her fast.
('93', 303, 6, 24, 607776) Gandhiji drafted this pledge for them to sign.
('93', 303, 6, 25, 607823) 2 Amtussalaam broke her fast at 9.30 p.
('93', 303, 6, 26, 607863) after the pledge was explained to her by Gandhiji.

('93', 304, 4, 11, 608437) I have always believed that we can take much work from the girl.
('93', 304, 4, 12, 608502) Dhiren wants to live in the Ashram and do khadi work there.
('93', 304, 4, 13, 608562) Read the postcard I have written to him.
('93', 304, 4, 14, 608603) If you see any difficulty in his staying in the Ashram in the manner suggested, dont hesitate to say so.
('93', 304, 4, 15, 608708) I should, however, be pleased if you could admit him.
('93', 304, 4, 16, 608762) If he keeps good health there, I am sure he will work very hard.
('93', 304, 4, 17, 608827) I understand your reason for sending money to Anna 2. He will continue to be a cause of worry to you.
('93', 304, 4, 18, 608929) Neither Jajuji nor you need worry about me.

('93', 304, 4, 20, 609044) Walking daily is of course tiring.
('93', 304, 4, 21, 609079) But if I can preserve my health or if it remains unimpaired on its own, I think I shall survive.
('93', 304, 4, 22, 609176) But all that is in Gods hands.
('93', 304, 4, 23, 609207) He will solve all difficulties if He wants to take service from me and wants my efforts to succeed.
('93', 304, 4, 24, 609307) If Dev arrives, I shall see.
('93', 304, 4, 25, 609336) Amtul Salaam broke her fast yesterday.
('93', 304, 4, 26, 609375) We spent the whole day in talks with Muslims.
('93', 304, 4, 27, 609421) On the face of it the result is good.
('93', 304, 4, 28, 609459) Everything is reduced to writing.
('93', 304, 4, 29, 609493) 3 You will read it in the papers.
('93', 304, 4, 30, 609527) She displayed great fortitude and courage.
('93', 304, 4, 31, 609570) Send Bapa a cheque for Rs. 25,000 for the Adivasis.
('93', 304, 4, 32, 609622) One cheque for the same amount has already been sent.
('93', 304, 4, 33, 609676) It was decided to send Rs. 50,000. I do not know what amount was earmarked for this purpose.
('93', 304, 4, 34, 609769) However, whatever is received in future will be credited to that account.

('93', 305, 5, 8, 610296) It is all right that you played a trick with God and sent it just at the time of breaking the fast.
('93', 305, 5, 9, 610396) I do understand why .

('93', 305, 5, 11, 610435) It is certainly not with me.
('93', 305, 5, 12, 610464) I assure you it will be no hardship for me to send the blanket.
('93', 305, 5, 13, 610528) I am sending it along.

('93', 305, 8, 22, 610877) KETHURI, January 21, 1947
('93', 305, 9, 23, 610903) Gandhiji explained the reasons which actuated the twenty five days fast of Bibi Amtussalaam and the reasons which brought it to an end.
('93', 305, 9, 24, 611039) The fast was broken at 9.30 last evening after the recital of the Al Fateha in a powerful and melodious voice by a Muslim gentleman who happened to be at the meeting.
('93', 305, 9, 25, 611206) Many Muslim friends including Abdulla Saheb and his lieutenant exerted themselves during the day to find out how the fast could be ended while Gandhiji was present in Sirandi.
('93', 305, 9, 26, 611382) It was common cause that the khadag for which the fast was said to have been undertaken could not, in spite of strenuous and honest efforts by many persons, be traced.
('93', 305, 9, 27, 611550) And if Amtussalaambehn persisted in wanting the production of the khadag, she must die.
('93', 305, 9, 28, 611638) But Gandhiji had explained to her that that could not be the real object of the fast; it must be a symbol of something behind it.
('93', 305, 9, 29, 611768) Gandhiji then said that the ladys whole

('93', 306, 1, 2, 611919) life was devoted to a heart unity between the Hindus and the Muslims.
('93', 306, 1, 3, 611989) Therefore if there was a real prospect of such unity at least within the area where she was working, there was every prospect of the fast being ended.
('93', 306, 2, 4, 612140) After full and complete deliberation, a document was signed laying down the principle that to each one his religion was equally dear with any other persons and that therefore different religions were to be mutually respected.
('93', 306, 2, 5, 612366) To this end the signatories to the agreement have pledged themselves.
('93', 306, 2, 6, 612436) Naturally, any wilful breach of the promise would implicate me in a fast.
('93', 306, 2, 7, 612510) On the document being interpreted to Amtul Salaambehn, the lady broke the fast as said before.
('93', 306, 3, 8, 612605) Gandhiji assured the signatories that he would help to the best of his ability in the matter of preserving the just rights of each community even as he expected them actively to implement their promise.
('93', 306, 4, 9, 612808) Gandhiji also expressed his desire that any development of any kind within the area mentioned in the document must be brought to his notice and convinced them that he would actively assist in the settlement of all disputes.
('93', 306, 4, 10, 613032) Gandhiji told the Hindus and Muslims of his dislike of matters being rushed to police and law courts.
('93', 306, 4, 11, 613134) Any surrender of its legitimate rights by the majority community or even the minority community for the sake of reaching an agreement, Gandhiji warned, would not lead to a lasting peace.

('93', 308, 10, 18, 615941) PANIALA, January 22, 1947
('93', 308, 11, 19, 615967) Gandhiji was happy that at last he had been able to visit the village of Paniala.
('93', 308, 11, 20, 616049) 2 But that was not enough; he would feel happier still if the Hindus and the Mussalmans succeeded in establishing unity and friendship between themselves.
('93', 308, 12, 21, 616204) Amtussalaam had undertaken her fast, as they all knew, with the same object.
('93', 308, 12, 22, 616281) And the assurance that the villagers in her neighbourhood had given to her should go a long way in healing the wound which tore the face of Bengal.
('93', 308, 13, 23, 616429) 1 Extracted from Srirampur Diary.
('93', 308, 13, 24, 616463) The report explains that the gathering was .
('93', 308, 13, 25, 616508) of the largest size so far encountered.

('93', 309, 0, 1, 616657) 310 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('93', 309, 1, 2, 616699) One problem, continued Gandhiji, which had been recently exercising him was in connection with the families of those who had lost their all in the course of the disturbances.
('93', 309, 1, 3, 616874) There were many families which had lost their earning members.
('93', 309, 1, 4, 616937) The survivors had to be looked after, while the children had to be educated and given adequate protection.
('93', 309, 1, 5, 617044) That undoubtedly was the duty of the Government.
('93', 309, 1, 6, 617093) Both he and they if they wanted heart peace should look at the question from a broader standpoint.
('93', 309, 1, 7, 617192) In his humble opinion, where the wrong was done by some Muslims, reasonable arrangements for the above purpose should be made by the Muslims of the neighbourhood.
('93', 309, 2, 8, 617355) Government would only act through force while the common citizen would act through persuasion and agreement.
('93', 309, 2, 9, 617464) Through the establishment of good human relations, citizens should try to tide over the disasters which might overwhelm the social body.
('93', 309, 2, 10, 617601) It was not good to depend on an organization based on force like the State for the above purpose.
('93', 309, 3, 11, 617699) Gandhiji then referred to two more matters, namely, the duty of volun teers and the rehabilitation of artisans.
('93', 309, 3, 12, 617811) With regard to the volunteers his advice was that they should never discriminate between one type of duty and another, have no preferences, but should stick to their post even at the cost of their lives.
('93', 309, 3, 13, 618015) It was the quality of discipline and sacrifice which made small things great in organized action.
('93', 309, 3, 14, 618113) Then, referring to the pro blem of the artisans, he continued, they ought not to depend upon charity however well intended but on their own resources in order to tide over their present difficulties.
('93', 309, 3, 15, 618313) In this connection he referred to his view supported by the scriptures of the world that he who ate his food without returning its equivalent by means of body labour was no better than a thief.
('93', 309, 3, 16, 618507) Permanent peace would come in the world only when the bond of labour shared in common held together different units of the social body.
('93', 309, 4, 17, 618643) The first question was: You said that Muslim majority provinces if they so chose had Pakistan already.
('93', 309, 4, 18, 618746) What did you mean by this?
('93', 309, 5, 19, 618773) Gandhiji replied that he fully meant what he had said.
('93', 309, 5, 20, 618828) Whilst there was an outside power ruling India there was neither Pakistan nor Hindustan, but bare slavery was their lot.
('93', 309, 5, 21, 618949) And if anybody maintained that the measure of provincial autonomy they enjoyed was equal to independence, they were unaware of the contents of Independence.
('93', 309, 5, 22, 619106) It was true that the British power was certain to go.
('93', 309, 5, 23, 619160) But if they could not patch up their quarrels and indulged in blood baths, a combination of powers was certain to hold them in bondage.
('93', 309, 5, 24, 619296) Those powers would not tolerate a country so vast and populous as India and so rich in potential resources to rot away because of internal disturbances.
('93', 309, 5, 25, 619449) Every country had to live for the rest.
('93', 309, 5, 26, 619489) Days when they could
('93', 309, 6, 27, 619510) 1 Gandhiji then answered questions by Muslim Leaguers.
('93', 310, 0, 1, 619565) VOL. 93: 7 NOVEMBER, 1946 16 FEBRUARY, 1947 311
('93', 310, 1, 2, 619613) drag on the frog in the well existence were gone.
('93', 310, 1, 3, 619663) Even before the Congress had taken up non violent non co operation as the official policy for the whole of India, that is, before 1920, a resolutionto that effect was passed in Gujarat under the chairmanship of the late Abbas Tyabji Saheb.
('93', 310, 1, 4, 619903) The speaker had said that it was open even to one province to vindicate its position and become wholly independent of the British power.
('93', 310, 1, 5, 620040) Thus supposing that following the prescription, Bengal alone became truly and completely independent, there would be complete Pakistan of his defi nition in Bengal.
('93', 310, 1, 6, 620205) Islam was nothing if it did not spell complete democracy.
('93', 310, 1, 7, 620263) Therefore, there would be one man one vote and one woman one vote irrespective of religion.
('93', 310, 1, 8, 620355) Naturally, therefore, there would be a true Muslim majority in the Province.
('93', 310, 1, 9, 620432) Had not Jinnah Saheb declared that in Pakistan minorities would, if possible, be even better off than the majority; therefore, there would be no underdog?
('93', 310, 2, 10, 620587) Gandhiji reiterated that if such a State was established by sheer merit and so long as the qualities of truth and justice were emphasized, as had been done by him (Gandhiji), nobody would raise any objection, call it Pakistan or by any other name.
('93', 310, 2, 11, 620835) If the Muslims felt that in their contemplated Pakistan, Muslims alone would be allowed to remain, Gandhiji thought he must say that it was something un Islamic.
('93', 310, 2, 12, 620997) Islam, he said, was based on the fundamental principle of democracy and toleration of other faiths.
('93', 310, 2, 13, 621097) If any individual, be he Hindu or Muslim or Christian, disobeyed the fundamental basis of others religion, it was he who fell, and not the religion.
('93', 310, 2, 14, 621246) If Pakistan meant anything more, the speaker did not know; and if it did, so far as he knew, it would make no appeal to his reason.
('93', 310, 3, 15, 621378) The second question was: How did your ahimsa work in Bihar?
('93', 310, 4, 16, 621438) Gandhiji said that it did not work at all.
('93', 310, 4, 17, 621481) It failed miserably.
('93', 310, 4, 18, 621502) But, if the reports received by him from responsible quarters were to be relied upon, the Bihar Government was making full amends and the general population in Bihar also had realized the heinousness of the crimes committed by large masses of Biharis in certain portions of that Province.
('93', 310, 5, 19, 621791) One of the Bihar Ministers came to Noakhali with the promise from the Bihar Government that they would spare no pains for rehabilitating the people.
('93', 310, 5, 20, 621940) Gandhiji said he was receiving letters and resolutions passed by the Muslim League and he was conversant with the case referred to by them.
('93', 310, 5, 21, 622080) He sent every case for immediate attention and thorough investigation by the Bihar Government.
('93', 310, 5, 22, 622175) To the Bihar Government Gandhiji had suggested the setting up of an impartial tribunal to enquire into the happenings and the Bihar Government had promised to abide by its findings in toto.
('93', 310, 6, 23, 622365) The third question was: Why are you silent about the eviction of Bengalis by
('93', 310, 7, 24, 622442) 1 The following paragraph is reproduced from The Hindu.
('93', 310, 7, 25, 622498) 2 This paragraph is reproduced from The Hindu.
('93', 311, 0, 1, 622545) 312 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('93', 311, 1, 2, 622587) the Assam Government?
('93', 311, 2, 3, 622609) Gandhiji said that he was not deliberately silent.
('93', 311, 2, 4, 622660) The question was not new for him.
('93', 311, 2, 5, 622694) Gandhiji said that he had it in his programme during his last visit to Assam.
('93', 311, 2, 6, 622772) So far as his information went, Assam Governments objection was to those who had settled in different parts of that Province without permission of the Assam Government.
('93', 311, 3, 7, 622941) When some years ago he went to Assam he was taken to the very spot where Muslims from Mymensingh had migrated and taken possession of vacant lands.
('93', 311, 3, 8, 623089) He had then given his opinion and held it even now that it was not open to persons to usurp vacant land wherever it may be, that is, whether in their own Province or in another.
('93', 311, 3, 9, 623267) For him it was not a Hindu Muslim question.
('93', 311, 3, 10, 623311) What he had said was of universal application.
('93', 311, 3, 11, 623358) If Assam attempted to evict lawful possessors, it would be guilty of crime against humanity.
('93', 311, 3, 12, 623451) What he had heard was quite the contrary.
('93', 311, 3, 13, 623493) But if there was a question of unlawful eviction, the Assam Government would not be above law and it was open also to the Bengal Government to vindicate the position of evicted Bengalis, here happening to be Muslims.
('93', 311, 4, 14, 623710) Gandhiji said that if the friends here had another tale to narrate he was ready to hear it.
('93', 311, 4, 15, 623802) Most he could do was to advise the Assam Ministry to set up an impartial commission of inquiry as in Bihar and refer the whole subject to it.
('93', 311, 4, 16, 623944) As a matter of fact the present Ministry of Assam was pursuing a policy chalked out by the Ministry previously in office.
('93', 311, 5, 17, 624066) The next question was: What in your opinion is the cause of communal riots?
('93', 311, 6, 18, 624142) Gandhiji said that in his opinion the riots were due to the idiocy of both the communities.
('93', 311, 7, 19, 624234) No one party could create a riot, he said, if the other party remained non violent and honest.
('93', 311, 7, 20, 624329) Referring to the recent outbreaks in Bombay and other places, Gandhiji said he had seen how an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth policy had been pursued to its bitter end in these places.
('93', 311, 7, 21, 624522) One day one Muslim was stabbed and the following day a Hindu was found stabbed and vice versa.
('93', 311, 7, 22, 624617) What else could it be called, Gandhiji asked.
('93', 311, 7, 23, 624663) It was the same outlook that lay at the root of all communal riots.
('93', 311, 7, 24, 624731) Gandhiji asked : We are children of the same soil and have the same origin and if any of my brothers provoked me to commit some evil act, why shall I submit to him?
('93', 311, 7, 25, 624896) If anybody tried to force a change of religion or if

('93', 311, 8, 28, 625072) 3 The following three paragraphs are reproduced from The Hindu.
('93', 312, 0, 1, 625136) VOL. 93: 7 NOVEMBER, 1946 16 FEBRUARY, 1947 313
('93', 312, 1, 2, 625184) anyone tried to molest a woman, why should he or she submit before this brute force?
('93', 312, 2, 3, 625269) He added it was incumbent upon anyone to court death non violently in resisting such force.
('93', 312, 2, 4, 625361) How long would an oppressor continue in acts of violence if he found non violent people who were determined to face death instead of surrendering?
('93', 312, 2, 5, 625508) Retaliation, according to Gandhiji, was not the remedy and it was non violence alone which could counteract wrong and put an end to the madness that was inherent in communal riots.
('93', 312, 3, 6, 625689) The fifth question was: Do you think that you would be successful in bringing peace to Noakhali without having it at the Centre?
('93', 312, 4, 7, 625818) Gandhiji replied that if by the Centre was meant a pact between Jinnah Saheb, President of the Muslim League and Acharya Kripalani, President of the Indian National Congress, he certainly held that such a pact was not necessary in order to bring about harmonious relations between the Hindus and the Muslims in Noakhali.
('93', 312, 4, 8, 626139) So far as he knew neither the President of the Congress nor the President of the Muslim League desired discord between the two.
('93', 312, 4, 9, 626267) They had their political quarrel.
('93', 312, 4, 10, 626301) But the disturbances in India whether in Bengal, Bihar or elsewhere were insensate and hindered political progress.
('93', 312, 4, 11, 626417) He, therefore, felt that it was open to the Hindus and the Muslims in Noakhali to behave like men and cultivate peaceful relations among themselves.
('93', 312, 5, 12, 626566) The last question was: Who according to your opinion have saved the Hindus and Hindu property in Noakhali?
('93', 312, 5, 13, 626673) Do you not think that Muslim neighbours saved them?
('93', 312, 6, 14, 626725) Gandhiji replied that the question assumed a subtle pride.
('93', 312, 6, 15, 626784) What was wanted was a spirit of humility and repentance that there were enough Muslims found in Noakhali who had lost their heads to the extent of committing loot, arson and murder and resorting to forcible conversions, etc.
('93', 312, 6, 16, 627009) If more mischief was not done, God alone was to be thanked, not man.
('93', 312, 6, 17, 627078) At the same time the speaker was free to confess that be it said to their honour, there were Muslims who afforded protection to Hindus.

('93', 312, 10, 21, 627330) PYARELAL, I have your letter.
('93', 312, 10, 22, 627360) No new man is needed.
('93', 312, 10, 23, 627382) Ramachandran suddenly arrived and I did not think it proper to turn him away.
('93', 312, 10, 24, 627460) Parasram insisted.
('93', 312, 10, 25, 627479) He stayed on.

('93', 313, 1, 3, 627696) Besides, so far as possible we must engage only a Bengali.
('93', 313, 1, 4, 627755) It is only proper.
('93', 313, 1, 5, 627774) Now if this new man turns out well, train him.
('93', 313, 1, 6, 627821) Do not send anybody to me.
('93', 313, 1, 7, 627848) It has to be considered whether or not Jivanji will have Parasram.
('93', 313, 1, 8, 627915) It does not quite suit me.
('93', 313, 1, 9, 627942) If his place is not with me, then he is certainly free.
('93', 313, 1, 10, 627998) This is a point to be understood.

('93', 313, 10, 25, 628671) DALTA, January 23, 1947
('93', 313, 11, 26, 628695) Gandhiji announced that the Chowdharis of the village had decided to give him the plot of ground on which the meeting was being held.
('93', 313, 11, 27, 628829) He congratulated the Chowdharis on their generous action.
('93', 313, 11, 28, 628887) The gift to him carried no meaning beyond that it was presented for public use irrespective of caste or party.
('93', 313, 11, 29, 628998) Naturally there would be a proper document setting out the grant.
('93', 313, 11, 30, 629064) He hoped that the donors would carry out the full purpose of the gift.
('93', 313, 11, 31, 629135) The further cause for congratulation was that he was accom modated in the house of Rai Mohan Mali.
('93', 313, 11, 32, 629234) He did not consider himself to belong to any caste.
('93', 313, 11, 33, 629286) He belonged to the lowest rung of the Hindu ladder.
('93', 313, 11, 34, 629338) In reality there was no ladder; no high, no low.
('93', 313, 11, 35, 629387) All were equal in the eyes of God as of law.
('93', 313, 11, 36, 629432) It was a happy

('93', 314, 1, 2, 629528) conjunction of events that it happened to be Netajis birthday.
('93', 314, 1, 3, 629591) What could be happier than that the Chowdharis should make their gift on this day and that a Scheduled Class friend, Rai Mohan Mali, should provide him habitation?
('93', 314, 1, 4, 629755) In the speakers opinion the great and most lasting act of Netaji was that he abolished all distinctions of caste and class.
('93', 314, 1, 5, 629879) He was not a mere Hindu, nor a mere Bengali; he never thought of himself as a caste Hindu.
('93', 314, 1, 6, 629970) He was Indian first and last.
('93', 314, 1, 7, 630000) What was more, he fired all under him with the same zeal so that they forgot in his presence all distinctions and acted as one man.
('93', 314, 1, 8, 630132) No doubt there was much else to be credited to Netaji.
('93', 314, 1, 9, 630187) Thus he had sacrificed a brilliant career for the sake of the countrys service and enlisted himself under the late Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das.
('93', 314, 1, 10, 630331) He suffered various imprisonments, twice became President of the Congress and at last by great strategy gave the slip to the guard put over him by the then Government of Bengal and by sheer courage and resourcefulness reached Kabul and passed through European countries and finally found himself in Japan, collected from scattered material an army of brilliant young men drawn from all communities and from all parts of India and dared to give battle to a mighty Government.
('93', 314, 1, 11, 630806) A lesser man would have succumbed under the trials that Netaji went through; but he in his life verified the saying of Tulsidas that all becomes right for the brave.
('93', 314, 1, 12, 630972) Gandhiji ended by saying that the Hindus should progress by forgetting all distinctions of caste and both the communities should develop unity of heart.
('93', 314, 1, 13, 631125) He was reminded of a saying of the Prophet in which it was said that a man would be judged on the Day of Judgment not by what he professed by his lips, nor by whom he followed, but by what he had himself done to implement the teachings received by him.

('93', 314, 4, 17, 631489) MY DEAR KUMARAPPA, Whilst preparations are being made to massage me, I want to devote a few minutes to letters about things with which I am intimately connected.
('93', 314, 4, 18, 631651) Yesterday I wrote to Aryanayakam.
('93', 314, 4, 19, 631685) Today it is your turn.
('93', 314, 4, 20, 631708) How is the village work flourishing?
('93', 314, 4, 21, 631745) Are all kindred activities correlated with one another?
('93', 314, 4, 22, 631801) Or is there still the jarring note?
('93', 314, 4, 23, 631837) The work I am doing here is the most difficult of all I have hitherto undertaken and I know that those who are working for the country take an effective part in the work here if they do their best in their respective spheres.

('93', 315, 5, 12, 632763) TAYABULLA 3, I have your recent letter.
('93', 315, 5, 13, 632803) I cannot understand this panic on the part of the Assamese.
('93', 315, 5, 14, 632863) It is panic which always unhinges man, much more so when it seizes a large number of people.
('93', 315, 5, 15, 632956) The resolution passed by the A.I.C.C. 4, if it is correctly reported in the papers, gives enough if not clear guidance to Assam for it will not compel Assam to act against the declared wish of the people through the Legislative Assembly.
('93', 315, 5, 16, 633194) Second, naturally Assam has to watch the future developments and act as occasion requires.
('93', 315, 5, 17, 633285) It would be unwise to take any precipitate action.
('93', 315, 5, 18, 633336) Whatever action is taken must always be taken so as not to impair the autonomous character of the constitution of Assam.
('93', 315, 5, 19, 633457) There need be no confusion in anybodys mind.
('93', 315, 5, 20, 633502) You will please write to me further if what I have written is not quite clear to you.

('93', 316, 8, 23, 634828) There is no other way.
('93', 316, 8, 24, 634851) It is no easy matter to change ones house every day.
('93', 316, 8, 25, 634904) I am convinced that your good lies in respecting Gordhandass wishes.
('93', 316, 8, 26, 634973) You must, therefore, stay in Surat till he desires otherwise.
('93', 316, 8, 27, 635035) From one point of view his plea that you should depend entirely on what he can provide for you, is just.
('93', 316, 8, 28, 635140) But from another point of view it is not just.
('93', 316, 8, 29, 635187) Whatever arrangement I make is bound to be within limits of propriety and reason.
('93', 316, 8, 30, 635269) You need, therefore, feel no hesitation in accepting it.
('93', 316, 8, 31, 635326) However, I have no doubt at all that in this matter too, you should respect Gordhandass wishes.
('93', 316, 8, 32, 635422) That is the only way for both of you to rise.

('93', 318, 2, 4, 637593) The interviewers then told him of a food cricis developing in that area and asked him if he would say something about it in his speeches so as to draw the attention of the Bengal Government.
('93', 318, 2, 5, 637784) Gandhiji replied : Though I am not saying anything about the coming food crisis, I am aware of the situation.
('93', 318, 2, 6, 637894) I am trying to solve it in my own way.
('93', 318, 2, 7, 637933) I do not see why the people should depend upon Government or other agencies for help.
('93', 318, 2, 8, 638019) We hear nowadays of people trying to secure foodstuffs from foreign countries.
('93', 318, 2, 9, 638098) As a matter of fact if people will help themselves, then the Government is bound to move and this is what I will call real democracy, which is built up from below.

('93', 318, 2, 15, 638471) I am trying to accustom myself to it.
('93', 318, 2, 16, 638509) Of course, I extract the oil from it and the remaining portion as you know, contains good protein.
('93', 318, 2, 17, 638608) Then take the many kinds of roots in the soil of Bengal which belong to the potato tribe and these can be used as good food.
('93', 318, 2, 18, 638733) Then again, you have abundance of fish.
('93', 318, 2, 19, 638773) Fish, coconuts and these roots can easily take the place of rice.
('93', 318, 3, 20, 638839) Incidentally Gandhiji mentioned the general supineness of the people.
('93', 318, 3, 21, 638909) As an instance he mentioned the water hyacinth which, if the people en masse volunteered their services for a week without any aid from Government, they could get rid of within a weeks time, causing a saving of thousands of rupees.
('93', 318, 4, 22, 639141) Gandhiji was asked his opinion about the Tebhaga Movement 1 in Bengal.
('93', 318, 4, 23, 639212) Gandhiji confessed his ignorance about the movement and asked for a note on the subject which the questioners have undertaken to supply.
('93', 318, 5, 24, 639349) QUESTION: Can we not build up Hindu Muslim unity through a concrete political programme?
('93', 318, 6, 25, 639438) GANDHIJI: Probably you can.
('93', 318, 6, 26, 639466) But I have got my own ways.
('93', 318, 6, 27, 639494) I think if people help themselves, then politics will take care of themselves.
('93', 318, 7, 28, 639573) 1 The movement was for reduction of the landlords share in the produce of land.
('93', 318, 7, 29, 639653) For Gandhijis views on the movement, vide Speech at Prayer Meeting, 31 1 1947

('93', 319, 1, 2, 639773) Q. This Tebhaga Movement of the Bengal Kisans expects blessings from you.

('93', 319, 4, 6, 639948) MURIYAM, January 24, 1947
('93', 319, 5, 7, 639974) Gandhiji began by saying that he felt much pleasure in being housed in a Muslim 2 house.
('93', 319, 5, 8, 640063) He and his party had received every attention.
('93', 319, 5, 9, 640110) The Muslim friends went so far as to find a maidan large enough to hold the largest number of visitors possible.
('93', 319, 5, 10, 640223) And it so happened that the meeting was the largest of all during his pilgrimage.
('93', 319, 5, 11, 640305) He attributed the largeness of the meeting to the fast of Bibi Amtussalaam which had a happy ending because of the sincere labours of Abdullah Saheb and his assistance and that of the leading Muslims of the villages concerned.
('93', 319, 5, 12, 640532) Whether his inference was justified or not, he flattered himself with the belief he had expressed.
('93', 319, 6, 13, 640631) He was sorry that there was poison administered to the public by some newspapers.
('93', 319, 6, 14, 640713) Newspapers today had almost replaced the Bible, the Koran, the Gita and the other religious scriptures.
('93', 319, 6, 15, 640817) It was wrong but the fact had to be faced.
('93', 319, 6, 16, 640860) Such being the case, he held it to be the duty of newspapermen to give nothing but facts to their readers.
('93', 319, 7, 17, 640967) He was also of opinion that the movement of minorities to the majority provinces was an impracticable proposition.
('93', 319, 7, 18, 641082) He knew the time when the late two Imam brothers 3 and the late Mazharul Haq 4 Saheb led both the communities and the leading Hindus, such as the late Brajkishore Prasad and Dr. Rajendra Prasad gladly worked under them.
('93', 319, 7, 19, 641302) Muslims of that Bihar must not leave Bihar.
('93', 319, 7, 20, 641346) It was true that some Bihar Hindus had acted inhumanly but that aberration ought not to deflect the Muslims from their clear duty bravely to stick to their homes which were theirs by right.
('93', 319, 7, 21, 641536) And the Bihari Hindus had to make all possible amends for the misdeeds of the Hindus who had become insane.
('93', 319, 7, 22, 641644) He would say the same to Noakhali Hindus and Muslims.
('93', 319, 7, 23, 641698) It was therefore a good omen that there were Muslims in the village to harbour him.
('93', 319, 7, 24, 641782) It was their duty to make even a solitary Hindu absolutely safe in their midst and Hindus should have faith enough to stay in Noakhali.

('93', 320, 11, 20, 642939) Whilst I do not endorse your remark that the atrocities committed by the Hindus in Bihar have no parallel in history, I am free to admit that they were in magnitude much greater than in Noakhali.

('93', 320, 12, 23, 643406) 2 According to the report Gandhiji had received a telegram from the Srivaikuntham Taluk Congress Committee stating that from February 20 about forty temples within the taluk were being thrown open to Harijans.

('93', 321, 5, 7, 644053) 2 You belong to a great University and hold the degree of M.A. But I am sorry to have to tell you that your letter is wholly unbalanced.
('93', 321, 5, 8, 644190) You will let me serve Hindus, Muslims and others in the best manner I know.
('93', 321, 5, 9, 644266) If fail I shall feel sorry.
('93', 321, 5, 10, 644294) But I cannot change my programme according to an opinion which does not appeal to my reason.
('93', 321, 5, 11, 644387) As to your note about the Noakhali Muslims, I should think that you should take your complaint through the proper channel.
('93', 321, 5, 12, 644510) Have you written to the Provincial Government ?
('93', 321, 5, 13, 644558) If not, I would suggest your doing so at the earliest moment.
('93', 321, 5, 14, 644620) I refuse to draw the distinction between aggressive and non aggressive communities.
('93', 321, 5, 15, 644704) This I say apart from the merits of the Pakistan controversy.
('93', 321, 5, 16, 644766) It is enough for me to claim to belong to India, irrespective of caste or creed.
('93', 321, 5, 17, 644847) Religion is my personal concern.

('93', 322, 11, 19, 646407) January 25, 1947
('93', 322, 12, 20, 646424) Gandhiji first drew attention to the fact that the tal 3 given was out of tune.
('93', 322, 12, 21, 646504) He suggested that all they did in the name of God should be in tune.
('93', 322, 12, 22, 646573) If they were out of tune outside, they were likely to be out of tune within.
('93', 322, 12, 23, 646650) He then alluded to two telegrams received from the Jamiat ul Ulema e Islam in Madras and Bombay respectively.
('93', 322, 12, 24, 646760) They said that he, an unbeliever, had no right to interfere in the Islamic Law.
('93', 322, 12, 25, 646840) He submitted that the telegrams were based on ignorance of facts.
('93', 322, 12, 26, 646906) He had not interfered at all in the practice of religion.
('93', 322, 12, 27, 646964) He had neither the right nor the wish to do so.
('93', 322, 12, 28, 647012) All he had done was to tender advice and that based on his reading of the Prophets sayings, etc.
('93', 322, 12, 29, 647109) What was more, he had observed in many cultured Muslim families total

('93', 323, 1, 2, 647428) disregard of the purdah as it is observed today.
('93', 323, 1, 3, 647477) But that did not signify less observance of the purdah of the heart, which was the reality, in his opinion, aimed at by Islam.
('93', 323, 1, 4, 647604) Whatever it was, it was open to the Muslim hearers to reject his advice if they felt that it was in conflict with the tenets of Islam.
('93', 323, 1, 5, 647739) The critical telegrams received by him betrayed, in his opinion, grave intolerance of other opinion than that of the critics.
('93', 323, 1, 6, 647865) Let them not forget that the courts of law including the Privy Council, which were often composed of non Muslims, interpreted the Islamic Law and imposed its interpretation on the Islamic world.
('93', 323, 1, 7, 648060) He, on the contrary, sought merely to give an opinion.
('93', 323, 1, 8, 648115) If he could not do so for fear of criticism or even physical punishment, he would be an unworthy representative of non violence and truth.

('93', 323, 3, 12, 648396) Panic unhinges man, much more so when it seizes a large number of people.
('93', 323, 3, 13, 648470) The Resolution passed by the A. I. C. C., 2 if correctly reported in the papers, gives enough, if not clear, guidance to Assam, for it will not compel Assam to act against the wishes of the people, declared through the Legislative Assembly.
('93', 323, 3, 14, 648711) Naturally, Assam has to watch the future developments and act as occasion requires.
('93', 323, 3, 15, 648795) It would be unwise to take any precipitate action.
('93', 323, 3, 16, 648846) Whatever action is taken must always be taken so as not to impair the autonomous character of the constitution of Assam.
('93', 323, 3, 17, 648967) There should be no confusion in anybodys mind.

('93', 323, 6, 20, 649083) MANILAL, I am reaching your letter somewhat late.
('93', 323, 6, 21, 649133) But it is difficult to attend to outside work in the midst of a tour in the course of which I keep on moving from one village to another every day.
('93', 323, 7, 22, 649281) 1 The report said that this was in reply to the addressees letter apprising Gandhiji of Assams dissatisfaction at the A. I. C. C. resolution and seeking guidance from him.
('93', 323, 7, 23, 649453) 2 Vide A. I. C. C. Resolution 3 According to the report, Gandhiji concluded his letter by asking the addressee to write to him again if the letter was not clear.
('93', 324, 0, 1, 649615) VOL. 93: 7 NOVEMBER, 1946 16 FEBRUARY, 1947 325
('93', 324, 1, 2, 649663) Why did Dr. Bhagawat have to give up that diet?
('93', 324, 1, 3, 649711) Has he also accepted defeat?
('93', 324, 1, 4, 649740) I do not, of course, suggest by this that, if he has not accepted defeat, he should resume the whole food experiment.
('93', 324, 1, 5, 649858) One should eat only such food as helps one to keep good health.
('93', 324, 1, 6, 649922) If Datar refuses to put up the building, is anybody else willing to do so?
('93', 324, 1, 7, 649997) Discuss the matter with the people there and let me know.
('93', 324, 1, 8, 650055) Does Datar permit the use of his bungalow?
('93', 324, 1, 9, 650098) Or does he seem reluctant to do so?
('93', 324, 1, 10, 650134) You should not trouble Jehangirji in regard to shortage of funds.
('93', 324, 1, 11, 650200) If needed, you may call for an additional five thousand from the Ashram.
('93', 324, 1, 12, 650273) Ultimately, however, the expenditure on that place will have to be found by the village.
('93', 324, 1, 13, 650362) If it cannot be done, we will have to consider whether we should stay on there permanently.
('93', 324, 1, 14, 650454) We shall not succeed in propagating nature cure in villages by obtaining money from outside.
('93', 324, 1, 15, 650547) I am certainly not unaware of the fact that Dr. Dinshaw is not able to attend to village work.
('93', 324, 1, 16, 650642) This need not frighten you.
('93', 324, 1, 17, 650670) There will be no harm if the Trust is made into a sub trust of the Poona Trust, nor if it is made an independent one.
('93', 324, 1, 18, 650788) However, even if it is a sub trust, it must include some residents of the village.
('93', 324, 1, 19, 650871) We should also ascertain what the residents themselves desire.
('93', 324, 1, 20, 650934) I am glad that Gangabehn pays occasional visits to the place.
('93', 324, 1, 21, 650996) Will the lady whom Appa Saheb has sent stay there permanently?
('93', 324, 1, 22, 651059) Has she become friendly with the other women?
('93', 324, 1, 23, 651105) I was happy to learn that Gokhale had calmed down still further.
('93', 324, 1, 24, 651170) Can you say that Purushottam had been fully restored?
('93', 324, 1, 25, 651224) I hope Paramanands eczema has been completely cured.
('93', 324, 1, 26, 651277) I should advise him to get married immediately, for it is most uncertain when I shall be able to leave here.
('93', 324, 1, 27, 651386) It is indeed a question whether I shall return alive from the place.
('93', 324, 1, 28, 651455) The best course, therefore, would be to go through the marriage immediately.
('93', 324, 1, 29, 651532) As far as I understand, this marriage is not intended to be a means of pleasure.
('93', 324, 1, 30, 651613) This is not the time for such marriages.
('93', 324, 1, 31, 651654) I believe that it is intended as a help in self control.
('93', 324, 1, 32, 651711) If my assumption is correct, it need not matter where I am.
('93', 324, 1, 33, 651771) The problem of the well seems to be a difficult one.
('93', 324, 1, 34, 651824) If a deep well can be successfully, sunk, it will be a great achievement.
('93', 324, 1, 35, 651898) But such efforts do not always succeed.
('93', 324, 1, 36, 651938) You have written that you are going to
('93', 325, 0, 1, 651977) 326 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('93', 325, 1, 2, 652019) think over it further.
('93', 325, 1, 3, 652042) It will be good, however, if the Government people guide you in your deliberations in the matter.
('93', 325, 1, 4, 652140) Ask Morarjibhai.

('93', 325, 4, 7, 652250) 455. LETTER TO MADALASA
('93', 325, 5, 8, 652274) HIRAPUR, January 26, 1947
('93', 325, 6, 9, 652300) MADU, You have become irregular in writing letters.
('93', 325, 6, 10, 652352) I hope it is not a sign of lack of orderliness.
('93', 325, 6, 11, 652400) Be that as it may; remain cheerful and calm.
('93', 325, 6, 12, 652445) I would like to send for you and Ramakrishna 1. But I consider it a false attachment.
('93', 325, 6, 13, 652531) If you eliminate 50 per cent of what you read in the newspapers you will be able to assess the situation to some extent.
('93', 325, 6, 14, 652652) Havent you heard that the hills appear beautiful from a distance?
('93', 325, 6, 15, 652718) And when I daily move from one village to another those who are just idle on lookers become a burden.
('93', 325, 6, 16, 652820) I say No to so many of them.
('93', 325, 6, 17, 652849) Then how can I say yes to you two?
('93', 325, 6, 18, 652884) I know that the two of you wont be a burden in anyway.
('93', 325, 6, 19, 652939) Still, try to restrain yourself.
('93', 325, 6, 20, 652972) I will consider you as having taken part in the yajna to the extent that you serve from there.
('93', 325, 6, 21, 653067) Look after the children.
('93', 325, 6, 22, 653092) Look after yourself.
('93', 325, 6, 23, 653113) I trust Ramakrishna is all right.
('93', 325, 6, 24, 653147) Has he come to a decision about himself?

('93', 325, 11, 29, 653312) PYARELAL, I have your letter.
('93', 325, 11, 30, 653342) It is all right about the man from England.
('93', 325, 11, 31, 653386) He will work well if he comes.
('93', 325, 11, 32, 653417) Write to him.
('93', 325, 11, 33, 653431) In my view it will be good if as far as possible you check your

('93', 326, 1, 2, 653583) desire to come.
('93', 326, 1, 3, 653599) I am saving time.
('93', 326, 1, 4, 653617) I do not like to talk.
('93', 326, 1, 5, 653640) There is a pile of work.
('93', 326, 1, 6, 653665) I am not able to do justice I should to the villages.
('93', 326, 1, 7, 653719) The body is unable to give more work.
('93', 326, 1, 8, 653757) I must be content with whatever service it gives.
('93', 326, 1, 9, 653807) Ramachandran came yesterday.
('93', 326, 1, 10, 653836) He says he is now calm, physically and mentally.
('93', 326, 1, 11, 653885) A bed was made for him on the floor of my hut.
('93', 326, 1, 12, 653932) The place is now becoming smaller.
('93', 326, 1, 13, 653967) I like it.
('93', 326, 1, 14, 653978) Hunnar has come.
('93', 326, 1, 15, 653995) Let us see how he turns out.
('93', 326, 1, 16, 654024) He is quiet.
('93', 326, 1, 17, 654037) You will find everything in the diary.
('93', 326, 1, 18, 654076) I am trying to fill it as much as possible.
('93', 326, 1, 19, 654120) There are shortcomings and they irk.
('93', 326, 1, 20, 654157) Once that feeling disappears it would be almost perfect.
('93', 326, 1, 21, 654214) If that does not happen, the fault will be mine.
('93', 326, 1, 22, 654263) Manu is doing a lot of work.
('93', 326, 1, 23, 654292) She has no time left for reading.
('93', 326, 1, 24, 654326) I cannot give time for that.
('93', 326, 1, 25, 654355) But it would seem she is shaping up.
('93', 326, 1, 26, 654392) You had promised to send her some Sanskrit lessons.
('93', 326, 1, 27, 654444) Send them.
('93', 326, 1, 28, 654455) Now it is 5.30 in the morning.

('93', 326, 6, 34, 654662) January 26, 1947
('93', 326, 7, 35, 654679) MRIDU, Tendulkar casually gave me your letter.
('93', 326, 7, 36, 654726) Tomorrow a telegram will go to you: My opinion adverse. It is 7.45 in the evening now.
('93', 326, 7, 37, 654813) There is no post office or telegraph office here.
('93', 326, 7, 38, 654863) Everything will be carried by someone to a telegraph office tomorrow.
('93', 326, 7, 39, 654933) This letter too will be posted tomorrow.
('93', 326, 7, 40, 654974) If you do not wish to live with me or near me what will you do ?
('93', 326, 7, 41, 655039) The work here is complicated.
('93', 326, 7, 42, 655069) You may gain something by being with me.
('93', 326, 7, 43, 655110) But I do not see any good in that.
('93', 326, 7, 44, 655145) If it is granted that I stay here, then I would like your coming.
('93', 326, 7, 45, 655211) Right now it is with great difficulty that I am able to keep even the few who are already here.
('93', 326, 7, 46, 655307) Troubles are endless.
('93', 326, 7, 47, 655329) You will know more when Tendulkar gets back.
('93', 326, 7, 48, 655374) How could the letter written to you have been lost?

('93', 327, 1, 2, 655481) that you will get it.
('93', 327, 1, 3, 655503) I do not even remember the contents now to enable me to write again.
('93', 327, 1, 4, 655572) I cannot swallow the idea of abortions.
('93', 327, 1, 5, 655612) I can understand the argument about the children thus conceived having to be brought up.
('93', 327, 1, 6, 655701) If you can convince me about the advantages of abortion it will be another matter.
('93', 327, 1, 7, 655784) Western sisters who were considered great failed to convince me.
('93', 327, 1, 8, 655849) In this respect I am impervious.
('93', 327, 1, 9, 655882) Are you keeping good health?
('93', 327, 1, 10, 655911) Are you taking care?
('93', 327, 1, 11, 655932) Sardar is deliberately spoiling his health.
('93', 327, 1, 12, 655976) Jawaharlal is very careless.
('93', 327, 1, 13, 656005) It is amazing how he is able to carry on.
('93', 327, 1, 14, 656047) Who can harm those whom God protects ?
('93', 327, 1, 15, 656086) I heard today that Jayaprakash has reached here.
('93', 327, 1, 16, 656135) He may pay me a visit tomorrow.
('93', 327, 1, 17, 656167) I am told he is at Kazirkhil.
('93', 327, 1, 18, 656197) I see from the newspapers that Major General Shah Nawaz is in Calcutta.
('93', 327, 1, 19, 656269) I do hope he will come to visit me.
('93', 327, 1, 20, 656305) Niranjan Singh Gill came today and has gone back.
('93', 327, 1, 21, 656355) His work also is incomplete.
('93', 327, 1, 22, 656384) My boat is being propelled only by faith.
('93', 327, 1, 23, 656426) I think I have written to you that Manu is here and sleeps with me, seen by all and with the knowledge of all.
('93', 327, 1, 24, 656537) This has nothing to do with the experiment.
('93', 327, 1, 25, 656581) The experiment is stopped; though I still have no doubt as to its relevance.
('93', 327, 1, 26, 656658) It is stopped only because of the colleagues.

('93', 328, 2, 5, 657396) Continue his treatment for three months and have confidence in him.
('93', 328, 2, 6, 657464) As for the rest of the matter in your letter there must be another side to it.

('93', 328, 9, 19, 658131) BANSA, January 26, 1947 Today is the 26th of January, the day of our freedom.
('93', 328, 9, 20, 658209) When Congress was born, India obtained a new lease of life.
('93', 328, 9, 21, 658269) Only a few Indians at the time were aware of the political significance of this, but gradually the Congress grew strong and it awakened freedom consciousness in every village by starting mass agitation.
('93', 328, 9, 22, 658472) In the days when there was no communal hatred no one cared whether a person
('93', 328, 10, 23, 658548) 1 According to Manu Gandhi, an A. P. I. representative who came up with a proposal for celebration of independence.
('93', 328, 10, 24, 658664) The flag salutation was performed by Niranjan Gill and Gandhiji merely attended the function.
('93', 328, 10, 25, 658758) Vide also the following item.
('93', 329, 0, 1, 658788) 330 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('93', 329, 1, 2, 658830) was a Hindu or a Muslim.
('93', 329, 1, 3, 658855) It is a sad thing to have to say that there are two opinions now where there was only one before.
('93', 329, 1, 4, 658953) But for the poisoned atmosphere prevalant here, I would have unfurled the tricolour flag myself.
('93', 329, 1, 5, 659050) Some friends suggested that I should perform the ceremony, but I refused.
('93', 329, 1, 6, 659124) Had an English officer, however, decreed that there should be no flag hoisting here, I would certainly have unfurled the flag, even if it cost my life.
('93', 329, 1, 7, 659276) But to whom may I appeal today.
('93', 329, 1, 8, 659308) Suppose I unfurled the flag and even my Muslim brothers accepted it but in sullen silence, I would not want that.
('93', 329, 1, 9, 659422) At the same time, I must say what is in my heart.
('93', 329, 1, 10, 659472) When the question of our having a flag of our own came up, I thought it unjust to have only one colour for it, as there are not one but many communities in India.
('93', 329, 1, 11, 659635) A day there certainly was, when all the communities of IndiaHindu, Muslim, Parsi and otherscherished this flag as their own.
('93', 329, 1, 12, 659760) Even lives were sacrificed for it.
('93', 329, 1, 13, 659795) Today many flags have come into being.
('93', 329, 1, 14, 659834) But the tricolour should stand alone as the Union Jack did at one time.
('93', 329, 1, 15, 659906) But that golden day of unity unfortu nately now belongs to the past.
('93', 329, 1, 16, 659975) But to whom shall I appeal.
('93', 329, 1, 17, 660003) With whom shall I fight?
('93', 329, 1, 18, 660028) We are all sons of India and hence are brothers.
('93', 329, 1, 19, 660077) What is our freedom worth if it accentuates internecine strife and hatred?
('93', 329, 1, 20, 660152) But proclaiming unity is as absurd as building castles in the air.
('93', 329, 1, 21, 660219) There can be only one call at present that we shall not rest till freedom is won.
('93', 329, 1, 22, 660301) Today brother is fighting brother.
('93', 329, 1, 23, 660336) How can there be a Pakistan before we win our freedom?
('93', 329, 1, 24, 660391) Is it the British who will grant Pakistan?
('93', 329, 1, 25, 660434) And who knows what kind of freedom we shall have?
('93', 329, 1, 26, 660484) The Britisher is certain to quit.
('93', 329, 1, 27, 660518) But America and Russia are not yet out of the picture.
('93', 329, 1, 28, 660573) If we are not alert we are lost.
('93', 329, 1, 29, 660606) Only a little while ago you all sang Jana gana mana.
('93', 329, 1, 30, 660659) What an ennobling song!
('93', 329, 1, 31, 660683) And we have many such.
('93', 329, 1, 32, 660706) We can be united if we but sing them sincerely, from the heart.
('93', 329, 1, 33, 660770) And if we dont unite we shall be considered fools by the rest of the world.
('93', 329, 1, 34, 660846) If you feel at heart that you should heed this warning of an old, experienced man, you must start from today to change your thoughts and deeds in accordance with my advice.
('93', 329, 1, 35, 661019) I did not unfurl the flag today but the Pressmen with me unfurled it.
('93', 329, 1, 36, 661089) It was for this same freedom that that great man of Bengal, Subhas Chandra Bose, laid down his life.
('93', 329, 1, 37, 661190) If even for his sake we cant perform the yajna, for whom shall we do it?

('93', 330, 1, 2, 661345) 462. A WOMANS DILEMMA
('93', 330, 2, 3, 661367) Q. What is a woman to do when attacked by miscreantsrun away or resist with violence?
('93', 330, 2, 4, 661453) Have boats in readiness to fly or prepare to defend with weapons?
('93', 330, 3, 5, 661519) A. My answer to this question is very simple.
('93', 330, 3, 6, 661565) For me there can be no preparation for violence.
('93', 330, 3, 7, 661614) All preparation must be for non violence if courage of the highest type is to be developed.
('93', 330, 3, 8, 661706) Violence can only be tolerated as being preferable always to cowardice.
('93', 330, 3, 9, 661778) Therefore I would have no boats ready for flight in emergency.
('93', 330, 3, 10, 661841) For a non violent person there is no emergency but quiet dignified preparation for death.
('93', 330, 3, 11, 661931) Hence whether it is a man or a woman he or she will defy death even when he or she is unassisted; for the real assistance is from God.
('93', 330, 3, 12, 662066) I can preach no other thing and I am here to practise what I preach.
('93', 330, 3, 13, 662135) Whether such an opportunity will come to me or be given to me I do not know.
('93', 330, 3, 14, 662212) If there are women who when assailed by miscreants cannot resist without arms they do not need to be advised to carry arms.
('93', 330, 3, 15, 662336) They will do so.
('93', 330, 3, 16, 662353) There is something wrong in this constant enquiry as to whether to bear arms or not.
('93', 330, 3, 17, 662438) People have to learn to be naturally independent.
('93', 330, 3, 18, 662488) If they will remember the central teaching, namely, that the real effective resistance lies in non violence, they will model their conduct accordingly.
('93', 330, 3, 19, 662640) And that is what the world has been doing although unthinkingly.
('93', 330, 3, 20, 662705) Since it has not the highest courage, namely courage born of non violence, it arms itself even unto the atom bomb.
('93', 330, 3, 21, 662820) Those who do not see in it the futility of violence will naturally arm themselves to the best of their ability.
('93', 330, 3, 22, 662932) In India, since my return from South Africa, there has been conscious and constant training in non violence with the result we have seen.
('93', 330, 4, 23, 663070) Q. Can a woman be advised to take her own life rather than surrender?
('93', 330, 5, 24, 663140) A. This question requires a definite answer.
('93', 330, 5, 25, 663185) I answered it in Delhi just before leaving for Noakhali.
('93', 330, 5, 26, 663242) A woman should most certainly take her own life rather than surrender.
('93', 330, 5, 27, 663313) In other words, surrender has no room in my plan of life.
('93', 330, 5, 28, 663371) But I was asked in what way to take ones own life.
('93', 330, 5, 29, 663422) I promptly said it was not for me to prescribe the means and behind the approval of suicide under such circumstances was and is the belief that one whose mind is prepared for even suicide will have requisite courage for such mental resistance and such internal purity that her assailant will be disarmed.
('93', 330, 5, 30, 663727) I could not carry the argument any further because it does not admit of further development.
('93', 330, 5, 31, 663820) It requires positive proof which, I own, is lacking.

('93', 331, 1, 2, 663915) Q. If the choice is between taking ones own life or that of the assailant, which would you advise?
('93', 331, 2, 3, 664014) A. When it is a question of choice between killing oneself or the assailant, I have no doubt in my mind that the first should be the choice.

('93', 331, 4, 6, 664226) KAZIRKHIL, RAMGANJ P.S., NOAKHALI DISTT., January 27, 1947
('93', 331, 5, 7, 664285) DEAR FRIEND, This is in answer to your question.
('93', 331, 5, 8, 664334) 1. It is a fact that I was hurt at the behaviour of many Muslims who sat out during the prayer and left when I commenced my address.
('93', 331, 5, 9, 664467) 2. I did say that I could not give up Ramanama at the bidding of any person or even if the kingdom of the world was offered to me; for Ramanama was to me the same as Allah, Khuda or God.
('93', 331, 5, 10, 664654) 3. I do hold that the God of Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Parsees, Jews and others is one and the same, no matter by what name a votary mentions Him or recognizes Him.
('93', 331, 5, 11, 664822) The idea is not my own.
('93', 331, 5, 12, 664846) But I have learnt to believe that it is universal.
('93', 331, 5, 13, 664897) 4. I do believe that all religions have equal status and that they are like leaves of the same tree.
('93', 331, 5, 14, 664998) No two leaves are identical though they are from the same source.
('93', 331, 5, 15, 665064) 5. It is a fact that in my daily prayers the Gita, the Koran and the other religious texts find place.
('93', 331, 5, 16, 665167) You have but to procure a copy of the prayer book published by the Navajivan Press, Ahmedabad and others to find what they are.
('93', 331, 5, 17, 665295) Nothing is my composition.
('93', 331, 5, 18, 665322) 6. My religion embraces Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, etc., for the simple reason that I believe them to have an equal status.
('93', 331, 5, 19, 665450) It is not a combination sweet or otherwise.
('93', 331, 5, 20, 665494) Every religion has its own place even

('93', 332, 1, 3, 665599) If I believe in the equal status of all the leaves of a tree, it is not a combination of my make but a recognition of a scientific fact.

('93', 332, 9, 16, 666202) PALLA, January 27, 1947 I am really happy that I am staying with a Harijan weaver.
('93', 332, 9, 17, 666285) He looks after me with such love and care!
('93', 332, 9, 18, 666328) A place where love is not is a prison; and a hut where love abides is more than a palace.
('93', 332, 9, 19, 666418) The fact is that I am charmed with all these huts of Bengal.
('93', 332, 9, 20, 666479) How can you get light and air in a closed room?
('93', 332, 9, 21, 666527) The tragedy is that while the style of living here is so simple and Nature has lavished her gifts so abundantly the Hindus and Muslims here do not treat one another as brothers.
('93', 332, 9, 22, 666705) Shall we debase ourselves simply because our creeds differ?
('93', 332, 9, 23, 666765) But I have every hope that we shall forget all this very soon and understand our responsibilities.
('93', 332, 9, 24, 666864) Even now shops continue to remain closed in areas affected by the riots, and people look at each other with suspicion.
('93', 332, 9, 25, 666983) But this harms only ourselves and no one is the gainer.
('93', 332, 9, 26, 667039) On the one hand there is danger of a famine from failure of crops on the other we are harming ourselves by our ignorance and inertia.

('93', 333, 1, 3, 667355) There are so many things we can do without troubling the Government.
('93', 333, 1, 4, 667424) We can easily do many things ourselves; for instance, improving general health and sanitation, insisting on cleanliness, cultivating fresh fruit and flower plants, making good manure and compost, etc.
('93', 333, 1, 5, 667625) Several such matters are awaiting our attention.
('93', 333, 1, 6, 667674) If we use our brains to this end what a stupendous gain it will be to us all!
('93', 333, 1, 7, 667752) And I guarantee that then we will not have a moment to spare for quarrels.
('93', 333, 1, 8, 667827) But we can attain this happy state only if we have wisdom.
('93', 333, 1, 9, 667886) It is my constant prayer that God may grant us good sense as this girl here has just been singing and endow us with the strength to do things purposeful.

('93', 333, 4, 13, 668106) KAZIRKHIL, RAMGUNJ P. S., NOAKHALI DISTRICT, January 28, 1947 Sardar Niranjan Singh Gill has told me of all the talk he had with you.
('93', 333, 4, 14, 668240) He says whilst you do not mind his men working in Noakhali you would doubt his bona fide until he with his men worked in Bihar just as assiduously as in Noakhali.
('93', 333, 4, 15, 668403) In the circumstances I have told him that he should first go to Bihar and work there and in order to be able to do so effectively he should take from you a note 1 of recommendation to the leader in Bihar of the League Party.
('93', 333, 4, 16, 668628) Unless he is so armed, I have told him, his work might, from the League point of view, fall flat.
('93', 333, 4, 17, 668726) I added that he should keep himself in touch with you regarding his work there.
('93', 333, 4, 18, 668806) As to his work in Noakhali, I have told him that, regard being had to your views as interpreted by the Sardar, he should withdraw his men from Noakhali unless you approved of his work in Noakhali.
('93', 333, 4, 19, 669003) It is not enough that you tolerate his mens work.
('93', 333, 4, 20, 669053) It should have your written approval.
('93', 333, 4, 21, 669091) His men can only be here as accepted friends of both Hindus and Muslims.
('93', 333, 4, 22, 669164) I cannot entertain them on any other terms.
('93', 333, 4, 23, 669208) I have told him too that he should find financial support not from private sources, including funds at my disposal, but should, in

('93', 334, 4, 8, 669943) You cannot sit still if you find that even justice is not done.
('93', 334, 4, 9, 670007) You have to discuss things with Pantji 1, Kidwai 2 and finally with Jawaharlal and Sardar.
('93', 334, 4, 10, 670098) If nobody listens to you, you should resign.

('93', 334, 9, 18, 670531) I reached your letter only today.
('93', 334, 9, 19, 670565) In the constant movement I feel called upon to do from day to day the letter was mislaid and it was discovered yesterday by chance in my unassorted and undocketed papers whilst I was searching for another document.

('93', 335, 1, 2, 670932) by the delay for which I must hold myself responsible.
('93', 335, 1, 3, 670987) You have done well to give me your views briefly.
('93', 335, 1, 4, 671037) Having had such views before me often enough I have no difficulty in giving you my reply.
('93', 335, 1, 5, 671127) 1. I do not think that leaflets and pamphlets can do any good at the present moment.
('93', 335, 1, 6, 671212) Unfortunately for the country those who have any influence over the masses have already made up their minds and closed them against any criticism.
('93', 335, 1, 7, 671359) In such a state of society I feel that the kind of activity you suggest must fall flat.
('93', 335, 1, 8, 671447) You should know also that such an attempt has been made 1 before and is even now being made, in my opinion without producing any appreciable effect.
('93', 335, 1, 9, 671596) 2. A volunteer corps such as you have in view could not be formed.
('93', 335, 1, 10, 671663) If by any chance it is formed its effort will be discounted.
('93', 335, 1, 11, 671724) Before that happy time comes it is necessary for each party or community to form its own corps of sincere Muslims and Hindus who will work for peace without any mental reservations.
('93', 335, 1, 12, 671906) Out of such a band of selfless workers of Hindus and Muslims a combined corps is bound to come into being.
('93', 335, 1, 13, 672013) Unfortunately we have not such men in any appreciable measure.
('93', 335, 1, 14, 672076) 3. I doubt if there are many Muslim missionaries.
('93', 335, 1, 15, 672126) But if there are even a few, there is nothing to prevent them from doing this valuable mission work.
('93', 335, 1, 16, 672227) You say it is necessary to secure such service.
('93', 335, 1, 17, 672275) My experience covering a period of sixty years tells me otherwise.
('93', 335, 1, 18, 672342) Such services are not secured.
('93', 335, 1, 19, 672373) They are freely given.
('93', 335, 1, 20, 672396) 4. Of course it is possible to organize a volunteer corps of Muslims only.
('93', 335, 1, 21, 672471) The pity of it is that it has not been done up to now in a proper friendly manner.
('93', 335, 1, 22, 672554) 5. I have already said that a combination will be premature.
('93', 335, 1, 23, 672615) Of course I have no knowledge of what the Congress organization is doing here and indeed elsewhere except such knowledge as is of no use being vague.
('93', 335, 1, 24, 672765) I hope you realize your suggestions do not require money but men and women of the right type.

('93', 336, 6, 10, 673487) PANCHGAON, January 28, 1947 I have come here with the greatest goodwill in the world.
('93', 336, 6, 11, 673573) I know if I fail in Noakhali my whole non violence fails.
('93', 336, 7, 12, 673631) Gandhiji said that he had always been a man of the masses and a man for the masses and he wanted to identify himself completely with the masses.
('93', 336, 7, 13, 673776) If they could tell him the way how he could reach more effectively the hearts of Muslims, he was ready to listen.
('93', 336, 7, 14, 673890) But on no account could he leave Noakhali.
('93', 336, 8, 15, 673933) So far as others working in Noakhali were concerned it was the duty of the Government to find out if they were really standing in the way of restoration of peace.
('93', 336, 9, 16, 674096) Referring to the question of his going to Bihar, Gandhiji said that he knew that it was the opinion of the Muslim League circles that he should go to Bihar.
('93', 336, 9, 17, 674253) He was, however, doing his best for the Muslims of Bihar from Noakhali.
('93', 336, 9, 18, 674325) He was in constant touch with the Bihar Government in this respect and a representative of that Government was now travelling with him.
('93', 336, 9, 19, 674461) If he went now to Bihar and found that the Bihar Government had left nothing undone, he would have to say it without any reserve which in his opinion might not help the Muslim League case.
('93', 336, 10, 20, 674650) With reference to the question of large scale arrests of Muslims here, Gandhiji said that the duty of a reformer was to try to replace corporal punishment by awakening of the conscience.
('93', 336, 10, 21, 674837) He had tried to do it in his life and succeeded though not
('93', 336, 11, 22, 674896) 1 The deputation, which was led by Mujibur Rahman, Secretary, Noakhali District Muslim League, met Gandhiji in the evening.
('93', 336, 11, 23, 675020) The report said that the deputationists wanted Gandhiji to visit Bihar.
('93', 336, 11, 24, 675092) They also pointed out that Gandhiji being a Hindu, recitation from the Koran at his prayer meetings was not appreciated by the Muslims.

('93', 337, 1, 4, 675404) So long as this was not done, the ring leaders should be arrested.
('93', 337, 2, 5, 675471) With regard to conducting of prayers, Gandhiji said that if there was so much intolerance that one could not hold ones prayers as one liked he did not know what lay in store for poor India.
('93', 337, 2, 6, 675661) It was at the request of a devout Muslim friend that he had included verses from the Koran in his prayer.
('93', 337, 2, 7, 675767) Of course, he never wanted to go against the tenets of Islam but he could not also listen to one particular person or half a dozen persons to whom they might refer him as to whether he was going against Islam by reciting from the Koran.

('93', 337, 4, 10, 676064) PANCHGAON, January 28, 1947 On my way here I was taken to three homes, one Hindu and two Muslim.
('93', 337, 4, 11, 676161) It gave me very great pleasure as all I crave for is love.
('93', 337, 4, 12, 676220) I was not informed in advance of the places I would be taken to, but I saw love in the eyes of those who invited me, and so I went.
('93', 337, 4, 13, 676352) At all the three places I was offered something or other to eat, but it was not the time when I usually ate, so I said I would gladly accept some fruit if they sent any to my next halt.
('93', 337, 4, 14, 676538) My granddaughter accompanies me.
('93', 337, 4, 15, 676571) The women welcomed her with love and an old lady embraced her on knowing who she was.
('93', 337, 4, 16, 676657) A Muslim sister who had made fish curry and rotis at the time, pressed her to partake of the fare.
('93', 337, 4, 17, 676756) What was the poor girl to do?
('93', 337, 4, 18, 676786) She refused the offer on the ground that she did not take anything at that early hour.
('93', 337, 4, 19, 676873) The Muslim women thereupon suspected that this Hindu girl was not willing to eat, because at heart she felt she would be polluted.
('93', 337, 4, 20, 677004) So, to allay their suspicion, she broke a piece from their roti and ate it.
('93', 337, 4, 21, 677080) The sisters were satisfied.
('93', 337, 4, 22, 677108) Neither I nor those who associate with me make any distinctions of caste or creed and we have no inhibitions against dining with anybody.
('93', 337, 4, 23, 677246) But I appeal to my Muslim friends to look kindly upon those Hindus who think they would lose their religion if they ate at the hands of a Muslim.
('93', 337, 4, 24, 677392) I understand that that belief is wrong.
('93', 337, 4, 25, 677432) But the test of brotherly love does not lie only in eating together.
('93', 337, 4, 26, 677501) This erroneous belief is sure to wear off with time.
('93', 337, 4, 27, 677554) Much has been achieved already in this direction.
('93', 337, 4, 28, 677604) But till that attitude changes please learn to appreciate love wherever you find it.
('93', 337, 4, 29, 677689) Only in this way will you come near one another.

('93', 338, 1, 3, 677866) Muslim brothers did not join in it.
('93', 338, 1, 4, 677902) But the host of the Pressmen begged them earnestly not to insist on his participation in the common dinner.
('93', 338, 1, 5, 678010) You will leave me in a day, he said but calamity will beset me after you go.
('93', 338, 1, 6, 678087) The people here will bring pressure to bear upon me saying that I had lost caste by eating with you and so I must become a Muslim.
('93', 338, 1, 7, 678218) I felt that the mans fear was well founded.
('93', 338, 1, 8, 678262) So I had to request the Pressmen not to hold the common dinner in the poor mans hut.
('93', 338, 1, 9, 678347) I dont know when Hindus and Muslims will shed their weakness and come close to one another.
('93', 338, 1, 10, 678439) But I am prepared to give up my very life, if need be, to see this object realized, and I appeal to you all to pray with me: O!
('93', 338, 1, 11, 678567) bring that golden day soon. [From Gujarati]

('93', 338, 5, 15, 678685) PUSHPA, I got your letter.
('93', 338, 5, 16, 678712) I am glad that you are devoting yourself whole heartedly to weaving.
('93', 338, 5, 17, 678781) I myself do not know whether or not I shall be able to leave this place.
('93', 338, 5, 18, 678854) I cannot go anywhere without solving the problem here.
('93', 338, 5, 19, 678909) Why do you remain confused?
('93', 338, 5, 20, 678937) With a man like Bhansalibhai to guide you, why do you feel physically or mentally lethargic?
('93', 338, 5, 21, 679030) Understand fully Chapter XII of the Gita.
('93', 338, 5, 22, 679072) We should surrender to the Lord all that we do.
('93', 338, 5, 23, 679120) The mind will not then waver.
('93', 338, 5, 24, 679150) It is as clear as daylight that we cannot cease even for a moment from action in some form or another.
('93', 338, 5, 25, 679253) If nothing else, breathing goes on, does it not?
('93', 338, 5, 26, 679302) Wisdom, then, lies in surrendering to the Lord everything we do.
('93', 338, 5, 27, 679367) Keep writing to me.

('93', 339, 3, 4, 679535) PYARELAL, I forgot to reply to your note concerning Shahpur.
('93', 339, 3, 5, 679596) I am having to work in such rush.
('93', 339, 3, 6, 679630) Join Dr. Guptas committee.
('93', 339, 3, 7, 679657) But Gupta himself should be told that the local Muslim doctor should not be boycotted.
('93', 339, 3, 8, 679744) Why should the local doctor not be on the committee ?

('93', 339, 6, 16, 680108) I feel sorry to hear about Abhas illness.
('93', 339, 6, 17, 680150) Why trouble Abha for anything?
('93', 339, 6, 18, 680181) Ask in writing.
('93', 339, 6, 19, 680197) It is not good to go or send anyone needlessly.
('93', 339, 6, 20, 680245) In my view you should not start or run a small dispensary.
('93', 339, 6, 21, 680304) For some time do not even talk of moving about.
('93', 339, 6, 22, 680352) I do not get any letters from Bihar.

('93', 339, 10, 28, 680560) JAYAG, January 29, 1947
('93', 339, 11, 29, 680584) Gandhiji at the outset dealt with a question that was raised by some Muslim friends.
('93', 339, 11, 30, 680669) Did he want Muslims to attend his prayer meetings?
('93', 339, 11, 31, 680720) The reply was that he insisted on neither the Muslims nor the Hindus attending the prayer meetings.
('93', 339, 12, 32, 680820) 1 Extracted from Gandhijis Walking Tour Diary
('93', 340, 0, 1, 680866) VOL. 93: 7 NOVEMBER, 1946 16 FEBRUARY, 1947 341
('93', 340, 1, 2, 680914) questioner meant to ask whether he would like the Muslims to attend such meetings, he had no hesitation in saying that he would certainly like them to attend.
('93', 340, 1, 3, 681073) What was more, numerous Muslims had attended his prayer meetings which had gone on for years.
('93', 340, 1, 4, 681167) The next question was whether he, the speaker, did not consider it wrong for him, a non Muslim, to recite anything from the Koran or to couple Rama and Krishna with Rahim and Karim.
('93', 340, 1, 5, 681349) They said it offended Muslim ears.
('93', 340, 1, 6, 681384) The speaker replied that the objection gave him a painful surprise.
('93', 340, 1, 7, 681452) He thought that the objection betrayed narrowness of mind.
('93', 340, 1, 8, 681511) They should know that he had introduced the recital from the Koran through Raihana Tyabjee, a devoted Muslim with a religious mind.
('93', 340, 1, 9, 681643) She had no political motive behind the proposal.
('93', 340, 1, 10, 681692) He was no avatar as was suggested.
('93', 340, 1, 11, 681727) He claimed to be a man of God humbler than the humblest man or woman.
('93', 340, 1, 12, 681797) His object ever was to make Muslims better Muslims, Hindus better Hindus, Christians better Christians, Parsis better Parsis.
('93', 340, 1, 13, 681923) He never invited anybody to change his or her religion.
('93', 340, 1, 14, 681979) He had thought, therefore, that the questioners would be glad to find that his religion was so expansive as to include readings from the religious scriptures of the world.
('93', 340, 2, 15, 682151) The next thing was that some friends had said that all prosecutions initiated by the Hindus against the Muslim offenders interfered with the progress of the work of peace between the two.
('93', 340, 2, 16, 682339) It surprised him.
('93', 340, 2, 17, 682357) What had peace between gentlemen to do with the prosecution of criminals.
('93', 340, 2, 18, 682431) He could understand the objection if it meant that false prosecutions should be withdrawn.
('93', 340, 2, 19, 682522) He would be whole heartedly with the objectors.
('93', 340, 2, 20, 682570) He went further and said that all such persons should be brought to book as perjurers.
('93', 340, 2, 21, 682657) He said also that the proper course to avoid court procedure was for the guilty persons in all humility to make an open confession of their guilt and accept the judgment of the public.
('93', 340, 2, 22, 682842) He would gladly help any such movement.
('93', 340, 3, 23, 682882) The third thing was that young men who had gone to Calcutta and other places in search of a career were bound to give a portion of their time to the villages.
('93', 340, 3, 24, 683041) The easiest thing for them to do would be to meet together and make an arrangement by which, say, half of them would take leave from office and serve for a stipulated number of months, at the end of which their place would be taken by the next batch.
('93', 340, 3, 25, 683292) If they had a will, there would surely be some way also for serving the cause of the villagers.
('93', 340, 3, 26, 683388) Those who did not find it possible to offer personal service might help by cash.
('93', 340, 4, 27, 683469) Gandhiji ended by citing the example of England, Russia and other countries where every family had sent as many able bodied men and women as possible for the defence of their country.
('93', 340, 4, 28, 683653) This was how unity of heart was actually achieved in the world and he hoped that we in our country would be able to rise above small selfish considerations and create that unity without which life itself would not be worth living.

('93', 341, 1, 2, 683945) 476. FOREWORD TO SELECTIONS FROM GANDHI
('93', 341, 2, 3, 683985) The following pages represent a labour of love.
('93', 341, 2, 4, 684033) Professor Nirmal Kumar Bose first published his selections in 1934 1 and they contained extracts from my writings up to 1934. But my writings have never ceased and so the Professor felt that he should bring up his selections to as late a date as possible, i.
('93', 341, 2, 5, 684292) e., up to 1942 with isolated later additions.
('93', 341, 2, 6, 684338) Though therefore this is called a new edition, it is in reality a new book.
('93', 341, 2, 7, 684414) The earliest and most elaborate attempt was made by the late Amulakhrai in Gujarati.
('93', 341, 2, 8, 684499) But that was years ago.
('93', 341, 2, 9, 684523) He covered my writings in Gujarati and Hindi too.
('93', 341, 2, 10, 684573) The volumes being in Gujarati never attracted much attention.
('93', 341, 2, 11, 684635) Such is our disregard of our own languages.
('93', 341, 2, 12, 684679) But I have known nothing so thorough of its kind as these volumes.
('93', 341, 2, 13, 684746) Professor N. K. Boses is such an attempt.
('93', 341, 2, 14, 684788) He gave me his manuscript early in 1946 when I was in Bengal to do with it what I liked.
('93', 341, 2, 15, 684877) But my preoccupations left me no time to look at them till for very shame I was compelled to do so.
('93', 341, 2, 16, 684977) The selections made by the author show the thoroughness with which he has gone into his subject.
('93', 341, 2, 17, 685074) Those who are interested in my writings will not fail to appreciate the authors labours.

('93', 341, 8, 23, 685402) from Katni.
('93', 341, 8, 24, 685414) The gentleman wrote to me probably at the same time that he wrote to you and I replied promptly.
('93', 341, 8, 25, 685511) I cannot lay my hands on a copy of what I wrote.
('93', 341, 8, 26, 685560) But the purport was that there would be no

('93', 341, 9, 28, 685692) 2 B. K. Bhargava had made an offer to maintain and find a home for a 100 to 200 Hindu families from East Bengal.

('93', 342, 1, 2, 685853) ladies [willing] to go so far.
('93', 342, 1, 3, 685884) I think I told him also that I did not like his laying stress upon Hindus.
('93', 342, 1, 4, 685959) In my wandering I did not find that there is any inclination on the part of the sufferers to go out of Bengal.
('93', 342, 1, 5, 686070) Nor do I think it wise.
('93', 342, 1, 6, 686094) For it they cannot, out of fright, return to their village homes, they will all be accommodated in other parts of Bengal.
('93', 342, 1, 7, 686216) A large number are already in Assam.
('93', 342, 1, 8, 686253) Some have gone to Bihar because there is a large Bengali settlement there.
('93', 342, 1, 9, 686328) My own effort is to send them to their villages, to make them shed all fear and to dissuade them from forsaking their ancestral homes.
('93', 342, 1, 10, 686463) Nevertheless, if there are any who would like to go to Katni, of which there seems to be no likelihood, I would of course bear Shri Bhargavas offer in mind.

('93', 343, 5, 15, 687775) He met on the way.
('93', 343, 5, 16, 687794) He should call on you today.
('93', 343, 5, 17, 687823) Have a full and frank talk with him and listen to what he says.
('93', 343, 5, 18, 687887) If he tells you anything new and you find it worth trying, do so.
('93', 343, 5, 19, 687953) He does not work only for the sake of money.
('93', 343, 5, 20, 687998) So if you find something worth knowing from him which is useful to villagers, pay attention to it.
('93', 343, 5, 21, 688097) Ask him all relevant questions.
('93', 343, 5, 22, 688129) I am very glad to know that you are keeping good health.
('93', 343, 5, 23, 688186) As for my health, so far it has been going on well.

('93', 343, 9, 28, 688410) AMKI, January 30, 1947
('93', 343, 10, 29, 688433) Gandhiji began by apologizing for the fifteen minutes delay.
('93', 343, 10, 30, 688494) It was due to his having been occupied with Zaman Saheb and Yusuf Saheb.
('93', 343, 10, 31, 688567) These officers took him to a model cottage they had had erected.
('93', 343, 10, 32, 688632) It was a good house but in his opinion unfit for
('93', 343, 11, 33, 688681) 1 According to the source, this was addressed to an ailing sister.
('93', 343, 11, 34, 688748) 2 Extracted from Gandhijis Walking Tour Diary
('93', 344, 0, 1, 688794) VOL. 93: 7 NOVEMBER, 1946 16 FEBRUARY, 1947 345
('93', 344, 1, 2, 688842) human habitation in the Indian climate.
('93', 344, 1, 3, 688882) Such a house could well be described as a box.
('93', 344, 1, 4, 688929) The inmates would be baked as in an oven and they would be suffocated when they closed their doors and windows as had become their habit.
('93', 344, 1, 5, 689067) He, therefore, suggested comfortable cottage of bamboo, straw and thatch.
('93', 344, 1, 6, 689141) Such cottages will be airy, cool and artistic in the Indian setting, especially in the midst of stately palms of coconut and supari.
('93', 344, 2, 7, 689274) He was also pleased when these officers informed him that the refugees had commenced to return from the places where they had taken refuge.
('93', 344, 2, 8, 689414) He hoped that this return would continue with unabated zeal.
('93', 344, 2, 9, 689475) He was of opinion that the people should dismiss all fear from their minds and feel safe in the midst of their own countrymen, whether Hindus or Muslims.
('93', 344, 2, 10, 689629) When they learnt to fear their Maker alone they would cease to fear their fellows.
('93', 344, 2, 11, 689712) They would find that there were none to frighten them if they were not afraid themselves.
('93', 344, 2, 12, 689802) This had been his uniform experience in the course of the last sixty years of his life.
('93', 344, 3, 13, 689890) The third question taken up by him was in connection with some fishermen who had met him on the previous evening.
('93', 344, 3, 14, 690004) They had complained that in this country where fishing was confined to privately owned ponds for the major part of the year, it was impossible for them to live if they were boycotted by the majority community.
('93', 344, 3, 15, 690214) Gandhiji expressed his surprise at this state of affairs and suggested that unless the Hindus and Muslims could rise above their present political differences and reasserted their common humanity and common brotherhood, life would become an impossibility where nature had designed otherwise.
('93', 344, 3, 16, 690506) He hoped, therefore, that the alleged conditions would be corrected by the joint efforts of the people concerned and real peace restored in the countryside.

('93', 344, 6, 21, 690881) In this age of reason why do you want to shelter Islam from reasoned criticism, especially when it is

('93', 345, 1, 2, 691267) from a friend of Islam that I claim to be ?
('93', 345, 1, 3, 691311) What I have said is, I claim, in consonance with the Prophets teachings.
('93', 345, 1, 4, 691384) Purdah as it is practised today in many parts of India is a mockery.
('93', 345, 1, 5, 691453) Real purdah is purdah of the heart of which I spoke at the meeting referred to by you.
('93', 345, 1, 6, 691540) You will not make me responsible for everything that may be attributed to me in the Press, which I do not even get time to read.

('93', 345, 8, 24, 692488) I just sat there holding the coconut.
('93', 345, 8, 25, 692526) Then I got tired and put it down.
('93', 345, 8, 26, 692560) For me this was heavy going.
('93', 345, 8, 27, 692589) Besides, you held up my work.
('93', 345, 8, 28, 692619) You should have waited a little, or, kept a vessel handy.
('93', 345, 8, 29, 692677) Then the floor too was dirty.

('93', 346, 2, 3, 692960) NABAGRAM, January 31, 1947
('93', 346, 3, 4, 692987) An old lady asked Gandhiji what they should do in case they were threatened with conversion.
('93', 346, 4, 5, 693080) Gandhiji said that to him the answer was simple : Religion is the breath of ones life and as no one could agree to forgo the right of breathing under any threat or compulsion, so no one should forsake his faith even if it be an alternative to death.
('93', 346, 5, 6, 693330) Be it man or woman, if one forsook ones faith at anyones command, one had no religion.
('93', 346, 5, 7, 693417) Unfortunately, Gandhiji continued, India had come to such a stage that some Indians easily abandoned their supposedly cherished faith.
('93', 346, 5, 8, 693552) Religion was ones breath of life.
('93', 346, 5, 9, 693586) If anyone agreed to forgo his religion under threat, he would reduce himself to a brute.
('93', 346, 6, 10, 693675) One of them asked what a woman, whose husband had turned a recluse, should do.
('93', 346, 6, 11, 693754) Gandhiji said : Such a woman should lead a very chaste life.
('93', 346, 6, 12, 693815) She should work for her livelihood.
('93', 346, 6, 13, 693851) She should not hoard anything but only keep that which is absolutely necessary.
('93', 346, 6, 14, 693931) It is wrong to assume that a person is a true hermit simply because he wears an ochre robe.
('93', 346, 6, 15, 694023) If the desolate woman is at a loss to know what to do, she could take to spinning.
('93', 346, 6, 16, 694106) I have called the spinning wheel the kamadhenu.
('93', 346, 6, 17, 694154) She should also chant Gods name as she spins.
('93', 346, 6, 18, 694200) In my opinion this type of renunciation will surpass that of her husband.
('93', 346, 6, 19, 694274) She should constantly keep herself occupied in altruistic work such as sweeping the village streets, giving bath to dirty children, etc.
('93', 346, 6, 20, 694411) There is a proverb saying an idle mind is the devils workshop.
('93', 346, 6, 21, 694474) There must be a similar proverb in Bengali.
('93', 346, 6, 22, 694518) If we sit idle, doing nothing, a thousand unhealthy thoughts will crowd our mind.
('93', 346, 6, 23, 694600) So one should never be without some sort of work at all times.
('93', 346, 6, 24, 694663) This is the best solution for the problem.

('93', 347, 2, 3, 694989) NABAGRAM, January 31, 1947
('93', 347, 3, 4, 695016) Gandhiji congratulated the audience, which was exceptionally large, on the perfect quiet they observed throughout the prayer.
('93', 347, 3, 5, 695142) He then referred to two communications he had received from Muslim writers who consoled him against his critics who questioned his right to speak about the purdah or other things pertaining to Islam.
('93', 347, 3, 6, 695342) The writers asserted, quoting from the Koran, that Islam was broad based and was exceptionally tolerant.
('93', 347, 3, 7, 695447) It welcomed criticism and invited the world to study the Koran.
('93', 347, 3, 8, 695511) One of them also held that no group or nation had remained without a prophet or teacher.
('93', 347, 3, 9, 695600) He mentioned these communications to show that all Muslims did not hold what he considered to be intolerant views.
('93', 347, 3, 10, 695715) He hoped too that the audience which contained a large number of Muslims would appreciate the testimony of the two writers who did not appear to be biased.
('93', 347, 4, 11, 695871) He then dealt with the following question addressed to him by some of the workers :
('93', 347, 5, 12, 695955) The Muslims were boycotting Hindu artisans and craftsmen and were taking to occupations like fishing, fir trade, pan 2 cultivation, etc.
('93', 347, 5, 13, 696092) Workers who desired to bring about peace between the two communities did not know what to do under the circumstances.
('93', 347, 6, 14, 696210) Gandhiji said he hoped that the news was exaggerated and that the boycott was confined to the fewest Muslims possible.
('93', 347, 6, 15, 696329) He thought that it could not be sustained.
('93', 347, 6, 16, 696372) The logical result was that any such move would be a compulsory exodus of the Hindus from the Muslim majority provinces, a result he had not heard a single leader encourage or contemplate.
('93', 347, 6, 17, 696561) He invited his informants to bring the matter to the notice of the authorities, not with a view to having anyone punished but with a view to having an authoritative pronouncement from them.
('93', 347, 6, 18, 696751) He further advised the audience to pray for wisdom to both the communities.
('93', 347, 7, 19, 696827) The second question was: There is a movement 3 for reducing the share of the owner from half to one third of the agricultural produce.
('93', 347, 7, 20, 696962) What is your opinion about this?
('93', 347, 8, 21, 696995) Gandhiji welcomed the move for the reduction of the landlords share from half

('93', 348, 1, 2, 697282) to one third.
('93', 348, 1, 3, 697296) He thought the move was substantial.
('93', 348, 1, 4, 697333) 1 He was prepared to go further and concede the entire produce to the tillers of the soil.
('93', 348, 1, 5, 697424) He believed that no one could claim ownership of land, which belonged to God alone.
('93', 348, 1, 6, 697508) He further believed that no one who did not till the land had any claim to the produce.
('93', 348, 1, 7, 697596) Only those who toiled should have a share in the output.
('93', 348, 1, 8, 697653) But in no case should anybody claim proprietorship of the land itself.
('93', 348, 1, 9, 697724) The land belonged to the Lord of us all and therefore to the worker on it.
('93', 348, 1, 10, 697799) But till that ideal state of things came about, the movement towards the reduction of the landlords portion was in the right direction.
('93', 348, 1, 11, 697935) But he warned the people against the use of compulsion or violence.
('93', 348, 1, 12, 698003) He could have no part or share in violence.
('93', 348, 1, 13, 698047) It was a reform to be brought about only by the cultivation of healthy public opinion.
('93', 348, 1, 14, 698134) The reformers must have patience.
('93', 348, 1, 15, 698168) He believed implicity in the aphorism: As the end so the means.
('93', 348, 1, 16, 698232) In his opinion it was pernicious to hold that so long as the end was good any means, however violent or unjust, were justified.
('93', 348, 1, 17, 698360) Many movements had come to grief by reliance on doubtful means.

('93', 349, 5, 10, 699713) 2 I endorse all your propositions though probably I would put them differently and comprise them into one.
('93', 349, 5, 11, 699820) But that does not diminish the value of the propositions.
('93', 349, 5, 12, 699878) Alas I am far as yet from that state !
('93', 349, 5, 13, 699917) At the same time, I am hastening towards it.
('93', 349, 5, 14, 699962) If I attain that state or even come near enough to it (and probably that is all that a human being can reach), this problem of Noakhali will be easily solved.
('93', 349, 5, 15, 700121) Let us see what happens.
('93', 349, 5, 16, 700146) Please do not hesitate to write to me or dictate a letter for me whenever you feel like telling me something.
('93', 349, 5, 17, 700256) Know that your messages will never be a strain on me.
('93', 349, 5, 18, 700310) And now I put before you a poser.
('93', 349, 5, 19, 700344) A young girl (19) who is in the place of granddaughter to me by relation shares the same bed with me, not for any animal satisfaction but for (to me) valid moral reasons.
('93', 349, 5, 20, 700515) She claims to be free from the passion that a girl of her age generally has and I claim to be a practised brahmachari.
('93', 349, 5, 21, 700634) Do you see anything bad or unjusti fiable in this juxtaposition?
('93', 349, 5, 22, 700699) I ask the question because some of my intimate associates hold it to be wholly unjustifiable and even a breach of brahmacharya.
('93', 349, 5, 23, 700827) I hold a totally opposite view.
('93', 349, 5, 24, 700859) As you are an experienced man and as I have regard for your opinion, I put the question.

('93', 351, 6, 16, 703720) Gandhiji emphasized to me that this was the first opportunity he had had of testing whether the ahimsa he had been practising was really of the brave.
('93', 351, 6, 17, 703871) He said that in the past he had successfully tested the efficacy of his non violence in his struggle with the British Government but he felt that his ahimsa was really not of the brave as somewhere in the background lurked the feeling that superiority in numbers would tend to sway the balance in such a struggle.
('93', 351, 6, 18, 704185) Gandhiji does not think that real bravery has ever been brought into full play so far in his practice of ahimsa.
('93', 351, 6, 19, 704298) Noakhali, Gandhiji said, offered an almost ideal situation for testing whether ahimsa could effectively be used by a small number of people against an almost sullen if not hostile majority all round.
('93', 351, 6, 20, 704498) The problem here was also complicated by the fact of the existence of a popular Government controlling the destinies of the people.
('93', 351, 6, 21, 704630) Even if he differed from the politics of those running the Bengal Government he was definite that if democratic Government was good for one Province it was equally good for another and, therefore, he must not do or say anything which would in any way

('93', 352, 1, 2, 704957) derogate from the prestige and authority of the Government.
('93', 352, 1, 3, 705017) A straight fight with the alien ruling power was one thing for him, but a struggle with his own countrymen, however recalcitrant unwilling they might be in doing the right thing by those under their care, was a thing too difficult for him to contemplate.
('93', 352, 1, 4, 705272) It was this difficulty that had induced him to keep the Bengal Premier posted with everything he saw or did in and about Noakhali.
('93', 352, 2, 5, 705403) Ever since the commencement of his walking tour, Gandhiji has been moving amidst a sullen population on the one side and a frightened one on the other.
('93', 352, 2, 6, 705555) He is, therefore, engaging himself in the dual task of infusing courage into the frightened Hindus and at the same time convincing the majority community of the right to protection of the minorities.
('93', 352, 2, 7, 705755) He is placing before both communities his ideal of brotherly living and also a programme of sanitation and rural economy calculated to help both communities to better and healthier living.
('93', 352, 3, 8, 705944) Asked if he would regard the return of all refugees to their villages as a sign of success of his ahimsa, Gandhiji replied in the negative and said that it would not be impossible to persuade all refugees to return home within a few days.
('93', 352, 3, 9, 706183) But this would not be any indication of the success of the ahimsa of the brave; for the refugees would then be relying for protection on those who persuaded them to return.
('93', 352, 3, 10, 706356) It would be real success if men and women picked up courage and decided of their own accord to return, willing to face cheerfully even death and starvation in preference to surrender or fight.
('93', 352, 3, 11, 706549) It was towards achieving this that Gandhiji had been addressing Hindus.

('93', 352, 6, 15, 706696) Gandhiji said that he wished to live up to the age of 125 and humorously enquired of the doctor if he could suggest any recipe for that.
('93', 352, 6, 16, 706833) In reply to a suggestion by the doctor that he should spend some time in Calcutta to recoup his health, Gandhiji said that he could not leave Noakhali until communal amity had been established there.

('93', 353, 2, 3, 707202) February 1, 1947
('93', 353, 3, 4, 707219) Gandhiji laughingly said that journalists 2 were dangerous people and he was saying so as a journalist himself.
('93', 353, 3, 5, 707331) Gandhiji also humorously said that Australia had not only become the whitemans preserve for the present but also, it appeared, for posterity.
('93', 353, 3, 6, 707473) Gandhiji said that India was, in that respect, too hospitable.

('93', 353, 5, 9, 707597) AMISHAPARA, February 1, 1947
('93', 353, 6, 10, 707626) Gandhiji drew the attention of the audience to the fact that the universal law applicable to all meetings was that the visitors should be perfectly still and observe silence no matter how vast the audience was.
('93', 353, 7, 11, 707837) Yesterday evening a Maulvi had wanted to speak for a short time.
('93', 353, 7, 12, 707902) Gandhiji had sensed what he wanted to say.
('93', 353, 7, 13, 707945) He therefore, contrary to his wont, allowed him to speak for the five minutes which he wanted by the watch.
('93', 353, 7, 14, 708053) The Maulvi took no more than three minutes but said what he had wanted to say.
('93', 353, 7, 15, 708132) He resented Gandhijis remark on the purdah system in vogue in Bengal as according to him, Gandhiji had no right to speak on the Islamic Law.
('93', 353, 8, 16, 708273) Gandhiji thought this was a narrow view of religion.
('93', 353, 8, 17, 708326) He claimed the right to study and interpret the message of Islam.
('93', 353, 8, 18, 708392) Gandhiji said that throughout his long life he had had the privilege of mixing with many.
('93', 353, 8, 19, 708482) Muslims in and out of India but he had nowhere heard anybody say that.
('93', 353, 8, 20, 708553) Denouncing the system of purdah, which varied from country to country, Gandhiji said that he was certain it had little to do with the Koran.
('93', 353, 8, 21, 708694) He was not inclined to believe that Islam was so susceptible to damage as to be confined within a narrow space beyond other peoples view.
('93', 353, 8, 22, 708832) Gandhiji was sure that it was contrary to Islamic teaching.
('93', 353, 9, 23, 708892) The Maulvi had further resented coupling of the name of Rama, a mere young king, with Rahim, name of God; similarly of Krishna with Karim.
('93', 353, 9, 24, 709031) Gandhiji said this was a narrow view of Islam.
('93', 353, 9, 25, 709078) This erroneous view had emanated from his wrong notion that Rama and Krishna were names of ordinary human beings.
('93', 353, 9, 26, 709192) Man worshipped the same God under different names and the Koran was not opposed to it.
('93', 353, 9, 27, 709279) Rama and
('93', 353, 10, 28, 709288) 1 Eight British Army officers met Gandhiji in the afternoon to convey their good wishes on his peace mission in Noakhali.
('93', 353, 10, 29, 709410) 2 One of the officers was a young Australian, who introduced himself as a journalist.
('93', 353, 10, 30, 709496) 3 The reports in the various sources have been collated.
('93', 354, 0, 1, 709553) VOL. 93: 7 NOVEMBER, 1946 16 FEBRUARY, 1947 355
('93', 354, 1, 2, 709601) Krishna were names of God and there was no bar in worshipping God as such, it certainly did not offend Islam.
('93', 354, 1, 3, 709711) Islam was not a creed to be preserved in a box.
('93', 354, 1, 4, 709759) It was open to mankind to examine it and accept or reject its tenets.
('93', 354, 1, 5, 709829) He hoped that this narrow view was not shared by the Muslims of Bengal or India.
('93', 354, 2, 6, 709910) Purity of heart was the criterion of a religious man but persons who looted other peoples properties, killed fellow beings and took Gods name at the same time were irreligious.
('93', 354, 2, 7, 710087) In this connection Gandhiji wanted to draw the attention of the audience to the work.
('93', 354, 2, 8, 710173) Dr. Sushila Nayyar was doing in Changirgaon.
('93', 354, 2, 9, 710218) She wanted to go to Sevagram to attend to the hospital for whose management she was responsible, but her Muslim patients would not let her go till they were restored to health.
('93', 354, 2, 10, 710395) She had also mentioned that in the village those, who had shared in the loot of October last were of their own accord bringing back some of the looted property.
('93', 354, 2, 11, 710556) He was of opinion that this was a happy omen.
('93', 354, 2, 12, 710602) If the infection spread, the courts would have no work to do so far as public loot was concerned.
('93', 354, 2, 13, 710700) He for one would ask Government to waive the right of prosecution if the looted property was returned.
('93', 354, 2, 14, 710803) But he said the return must be sincere and full, whether by the guilty one or the public, and not a mere token to avoid prosecution.
('93', 354, 2, 15, 710936) What he aimed at was a change of heart and not a truce superimposed by the military or the police.
('93', 354, 2, 16, 711035) A popular ministry could not impose its will on the people.
('93', 354, 2, 17, 711095) Gandhiji said : I shall most gladly leave Noakhali when I am certain that all are acting with amity and sincerity, but I shall lay down my life here for the fulfilment of my mission.
('93', 354, 3, 18, 711278) Gandhiji then answered the following question :
('93', 354, 4, 19, 711326) You have asked rich men to be trustees.
('93', 354, 4, 20, 711366) Is it implied that they should give up private ownership of their property and create out of it a trust valid in the eyes of the law and managed democratically?
('93', 354, 4, 21, 711527) How will the successor of the present incumbent be determined on his demise?
('93', 354, 5, 22, 711604) In answer Gandhiji said that he adhered to the position taken by him years ago that everything belonged to God and was from God.
('93', 354, 5, 23, 711733) Therefore it was for His people as a whole, not for a particular individual.
('93', 354, 5, 24, 711810) When an individual had more than his proportionate portion he became a trustee of that portion for Gods people.
('93', 354, 5, 25, 711922) God who was all powerful had no need to store.
('93', 354, 5, 26, 711969) He created from day to day.
('93', 354, 5, 27, 711997) Hence men also should in theory live day to day and not stock things.
('93', 354, 5, 28, 712067) If this truth was imbibed by the people generally, it would become legalized and trusteeship would become a legalized institution.
('93', 354, 5, 29, 712198) He wished it became a gift from India to the world.
('93', 354, 5, 30, 712250) Then there would be no exploitation and no reserves as in Australia and other countries for white men and their posterity.
('93', 354, 5, 31, 712373) In these distinctions lay the seeds of a war more virulent than the last two.
('93', 354, 5, 32, 712451) As to the successor, the trustee in office would have the right to nominate his successor subject to legal sanction.
('93', 355, 0, 1, 712568) 356 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('93', 355, 1, 2, 712610) Gandhiji referred to small talks, whispers and innuendos going round of which he had become aware.
('93', 355, 1, 3, 712709) He was already in the midst of so much suspicion and distrust, he told the gathering, that he did not want his most innocent acts to be misunderstood and misrepresented.
('93', 355, 1, 4, 712879) He had his granddaughter with him.
('93', 355, 1, 5, 712914) She shared the same bed with him.
('93', 355, 1, 6, 712948) The Prophet had discounted eunuchs who became such by an operation.
('93', 355, 1, 7, 713016) But he welcomed eunuchs made such through prayer by God.
('93', 355, 1, 8, 713073) His was that aspiration.
('93', 355, 1, 9, 713098) It was in the spirit of Gods eunuch that he had approached what he considered was his duty.
('93', 355, 1, 10, 713190) It was an integral part of the yajna he was performing and he invited them to bless the effort.
('93', 355, 1, 11, 713286) He knew that his action had excited criticism even among his friends.
('93', 355, 1, 12, 713356) But a duty could not be shirked even for the sake of the most intimate friends.

('93', 357, 1, 2, 715680) 1. If the presence of anyone is a bar to the restoration of normal conditions, such a person or persons should be dealt with by the Government under its powers.
('93', 357, 1, 3, 715841) 2. Of course, the responsibility for the restoration of peace rests as it must on the local Hindu and Muslim leaders.
('93', 357, 1, 4, 715959) I should think however that they would not disdain the help of others when it is proffered.
('93', 357, 1, 5, 716051) 3. If my prayer meetings are disliked by Muslims, they have but to abstain from attendance.
('93', 357, 1, 6, 716143) I hope it does not mean that non Muslims may not offer public prayers in the manner they know best.
('93', 357, 1, 7, 716243) Whilst I must give what weight I can to the opinion of District Muslim League, I must be allowed to judge for myself whether my presence is necessary and whether I must move from place to place or not.

('93', 358, 2, 3, 717608) SATGHARIA, February 2, 1947
('93', 358, 3, 4, 717636) Gandhiji deliberately referred to his private life because he had never thought that the private life of individuals did not affect the course of the public activities of those individuals.
('93', 358, 3, 5, 717826) Thus he did not believe that he could be immoral in private life and yet be an efficient public servant.
('93', 358, 3, 6, 717931) His public conduct was bound to be affected by his private.
('93', 358, 3, 7, 717991) He held that much mischief was made throughout the world by divorce between public and private conduct.
('93', 358, 3, 8, 718095) And when he was engaged in the supreme test of non violence in his life, he wished to be judged before God and man by the sum total of his activities, both private and public.
('93', 358, 3, 9, 718271) As he had said years ago, non violent life was an act of self examination and self purification whether by an individual, a group or a nation.
('93', 358, 4, 10, 718414) This led him to the answers of some questions addressed to him and arising out of his remarks on trusteeship.
('93', 358, 5, 11, 718524) Q. Was it possible to defend by means of non violence anything which could only be gained through violence?
('93', 358, 6, 12, 718632) A. It followed from what he had said above that what was gained by violence could not only be defended by non violence but the latter required the abandonment of the ill gotten gains.
('93', 358, 7, 13, 718816) Q. Was the accumulation of capital possible except through violence whether open or tacit ?
('93', 358, 8, 14, 718908) A. Such accumulation by private persons was impossible except through violent means but accumulation by the State in a non violent society was not only possible, it was desirable and inevitable.
('93', 358, 9, 15, 719103) Q. Whether a man accumulated material or moral wealth he did so only through the help or co operation of other members of society.
('93', 358, 9, 16, 719234) Had he then the moral right to use any of it mainly for personal advantage?
('93', 358, 10, 17, 719310) A. No, he had no moral right.
('93', 358, 11, 18, 719340) Q. How would the successor of a trustee be determined?
('93', 358, 11, 19, 719395) Would he only have the right of proposing a name, the right of finalization vested in the State?
('93', 358, 12, 20, 719492) A. As he had said 2 yesterday, choice should be given to the original owner
('93', 358, 13, 21, 719568) 1 This appeared under the title Gandhiji on Trusteeship.
('93', 358, 13, 22, 719625) Gandhiji began his weekly silence as the prayer started.
('93', 358, 13, 23, 719682) His written speech was rendered into Bengali and read out by Nirmal Kumar Bose.

('93', 359, 1, 2, 719846) who became the first trustee, but the choice must be finalized by the State.
('93', 359, 1, 3, 719923) Such arrangement puts a check on the State as well as the individual.
('93', 359, 2, 4, 719993) Q. When the replacement of private by public property thus took place through the operation of the theory of trusteeship, would the ownership vest in the State, which was an instrument of violence or in associations of a voluntary character like village communes and municipalities, which might of course derive their final authority from State made laws?
('93', 359, 3, 5, 720349) A. That question involved some confusion of thought.
('93', 359, 3, 6, 720402) Legal ownership in the transformed condition vested in the trustee, not in the State.
('93', 359, 3, 7, 720488) It was to avoid confiscation that the doctrine of trusteeship came into play retaining for the society the ability of the original owner in his own right.
('93', 359, 3, 8, 720643) Nor did he, the speaker, hold that the state must always be based on violence.
('93', 359, 3, 9, 720722) It might be so in theory but the practice of the theory demanded a State which would for the most part be based on non violence.

('93', 359, 6, 13, 720972) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter of 15th [ultimo] 2. It came into my hands on the 31st.
('93', 359, 6, 14, 721059) The Prime Minister of Bengal did send me a copy of the resolutions of your working committee, but I did not know that those were sent to me at your instance.
('93', 359, 6, 15, 721217) If I had understood so I would undoubtedly have sent you an acknowledgement.
('93', 359, 6, 16, 721294) So far as I know I have made no public statement with reference to resolutions of your report.
('93', 359, 6, 17, 721389) But I do confess that they do not bear the impress of sobriety.
('93', 359, 6, 18, 721453) And many statements appear to me to be unbelievable.
('93', 359, 6, 19, 721506) Nevertheless, as you should know, I have made strong recommendation that the Bihar Government should appoint an impartial commission of enquiry into the whole of the painful episode.

('93', 359, 7, 21, 721769) The addressee had informed Gandhiji about the unimpeachable instances of human monstrosities in which the Hindus indulged during the period of Bihar carnage.
('93', 359, 7, 22, 721927) He had criticized the Congress for its indifference towards riots.

('93', 361, 9, 21, 724663) SADHURKHIL, February 3, 1947
('93', 361, 10, 22, 724692) At the outset, Gandhiji said that what he had said about his private life was not for blind imitation.
('93', 361, 10, 23, 724795) He never claimed to have extraordinary powers.
('93', 361, 10, 24, 724842) What he did was
('93', 361, 11, 25, 724858) 1 Extracted from Gandhijis Walking Tour Diary.
('93', 361, 11, 26, 724905) The first paragraph is reproduced from Amrita Bazar Patrika.
('93', 362, 0, 1, 724966) VOL. 93: 7 NOVEMBER, 1946 16 FEBRUARY, 1947 363
('93', 362, 1, 2, 725014) for all to do if they conformed to conditions observed by him.
('93', 362, 1, 3, 725077) If that was not done, those who pretended to imitate his practice were doomed to perdition.
('93', 362, 1, 4, 725169) What he was doing was undoubtedly dangerous, but it ceased to be so, if the conditions were rightly observed.
('93', 362, 2, 5, 725279) Gandhiji referred with hesitation to the resolution passed by the Muslim League 1 on the Constituent Assembly.
('93', 362, 2, 6, 725390) It considered the Congress resolution to be dishonest and that it did not mean what it said.
('93', 362, 2, 7, 725483) It was also said that the elections and other dealings of the Assembly were illegal.
('93', 362, 2, 8, 725568) The speaker pleaded that there should be no imputation of dishonesty by one party to the other.
('93', 362, 2, 9, 725664) It was not good for the great organization which they both were.
('93', 362, 2, 10, 725729) There was no reason why they should regard each other as enemies.
('93', 362, 2, 11, 725795) That practice would not lead them to independence.
('93', 362, 2, 12, 725846) If the elections and proceedings were illegal their legality should be challenged in a court of law.
('93', 362, 2, 13, 725947) Otherwise, the charge had no meaning.
('93', 362, 2, 14, 725985) If they did not wish to recognize the courts as he did in 1920 and later, then the talk of illegality should cease.
('93', 362, 2, 15, 726101) He would plead with the League that they should go into the Assembly and state their case and influence the proceedings.
('93', 362, 2, 16, 726222) But if they did not, he would advise them to test the sincerity of the Assembly and see how it dealt with the Muslim problem.
('93', 362, 2, 17, 726348) It was due to themselves and the rest of the country unless they wanted to rely upon the law of the sword which he was sure they did not wish to do.
('93', 362, 2, 18, 726497) Then the League had said that the Assembly represented only the caste Hindus.
('93', 362, 2, 19, 726575) Surely there were in the Assembly the Scheduled Classes, the Christians, the Parsis, the Anglo Indians and all those who considered themselves sons of India.
('93', 362, 2, 20, 726733) Then Dr. Ambedkar 2 was good enough to attend the Assembly, not to mention the other large number of the Scheduled Classes.
('93', 362, 2, 21, 726857) The Sikhs too were still there.
('93', 362, 2, 22, 726889) It was open to the League to put up their fight within the Assembly.
('93', 362, 3, 23, 726958) As to the British Government who the League contended should dismiss the Assembly, he entertained the hope, though he admitted it was somewhat shaken, that they would honestly carry to the end the voluntary document.
('93', 362, 3, 24, 727175) He submitted that the British Government was bound to act according to the State Paper even if a few Provinces chose to establish their independence in accordance with the Paper.
('93', 362, 3, 25, 727354) He hoped that the British would not forfeit all credit for honest dealing with India.
('93', 362, 4, 26, 727440) Gandhiji concluded by saying that whilst he felt obliged to refer to League politics, he warned the audience against inferring that the Hindus and Muslims were to regard each other as enemies.
('93', 362, 4, 27, 727633) The League had made no such announcement.
('93', 362, 4, 28, 727675) Let the political quarrel be confined to the politicians at the top.
('93', 362, 4, 29, 727744) It would be a disaster if the

('93', 363, 1, 3, 728098) The way to Indian independence lay not through the sword but through mutual friendship and adjustment.
('93', 363, 1, 4, 728201) He was in Noakhali to show what real Pakistan could mean.
('93', 363, 1, 5, 728259) Bengal was the one Province in India where it could be demonstrated.
('93', 363, 1, 6, 728328) Bengal had produced talented Hindus and talented Muslims.
('93', 363, 1, 7, 728386) Bengal had contributed largely to the national struggle.
('93', 363, 1, 8, 728443) It was in the fitness of things that Bengal should now show how the Muslims and the Hindus could live together as friends and brothers.
('93', 363, 1, 9, 728579) Then there would be no reason for Bengal to remain a deficit province.
('93', 363, 1, 10, 728650) It ought to be a province of plenty.

('93', 364, 4, 7, 730179) SADHURKHIL, February 4, 1947
('93', 364, 5, 8, 730208) At the time of Gandhijis speech some Muslim friends wished to read an address in Bengali which Gandhiji said might be read if it pleased the friends.
('93', 364, 5, 9, 730358) It referred to the music before mosques, cow slaughter, etc.
('93', 364, 5, 10, 730419) Gandhiji said he was not concerned with these questions.
('93', 364, 5, 11, 730476) They were questions of law.
('93', 364, 5, 12, 730504) He wanted to capture their hearts and see them welded into one.
('93', 364, 5, 13, 730568) If that was attained, everything else would right itself.
('93', 364, 5, 14, 730626) If their hearts were not united, nothing could be right.
('93', 364, 5, 15, 730683) Their unfortunate lot would then be slavery.
('93', 364, 5, 16, 730728) He asked them to accept the slavery of the one Omnipotent God no matter by what name they addressed Him.
('93', 364, 5, 17, 730833) Then they would bend the knee to no man or men.
('93', 364, 5, 18, 730881) It was ignorance to say that he coupled Rama, a mere man, with God.
('93', 364, 5, 19, 730949) He had repeatedly made it clear that his Rama was the same as God.
('93', 364, 5, 20, 731016) His Rama was before, is present now and would be for all time.
('93', 364, 5, 21, 731079) He was Unborn and Uncreated.
('93', 364, 5, 22, 731108) Therefore, let them tolerate and respect the different faiths.
('93', 364, 5, 23, 731171) He was himself an iconoclast but he had equal regard for the so called idolaters.
('93', 364, 5, 24, 731253) Those who worshipped idols also worshipped the same God who was everywhere, even in a clod of earth, even in a nail that was pared off.
('93', 364, 5, 25, 731389) He had Muslim friends whose names were Rahim, Rahman, Karim.
('93', 364, 5, 26, 731450) Would he therefore join on to the name of God when he addressed them as Rahim, Karim or Rahman?
('93', 364, 6, 27, 731546) Let them beware of the thought that all was well in Noakhali or the neighbouring parts.
('93', 364, 6, 28, 731634) If the reports he received were at all true, things had not quite settled down.
('93', 364, 6, 29, 731714) He did not refer to these things or the destruction that had been wrought because he did not wish to excite passion.
('93', 364, 6, 30, 731831) He did not believe in retaliation.
('93', 364, 6, 31, 731866) He had lived with Pathans.
('93', 364, 6, 32, 731893) Badshah Khan 4, being tired of retaliation which had descended from generation to generation, had learnt the virtue of non violence.
('93', 364, 6, 33, 732026) He did not claim perfection for him.
('93', 364, 6, 34, 732063) He could be angered.
('93', 364, 6, 35, 732084) But he did claim for his friend the wisdom that dictated to him restraint on ones love of vengeance.
('93', 364, 6, 36, 732185) He wanted the same thing in Noakhali.
('93', 364, 6, 37, 732223) Unless they sincerely believed that without real peace between the communities there was neither Pakistan nor Hindustan, slavery was their lot.
('93', 364, 7, 38, 732367) 1 Presumably the reference is to the resolution passed by the Congress in 1925. 2 The letter is incomplete.

('93', 365, 1, 2, 732584) He had a visit from four Muslim friends who deplored the fact that he had not corrected the exaggeration about the number of murders in Noakhali and the adjacent parts.
('93', 365, 1, 3, 732753) He had not done so because he did not wish to bring out all he had seen.
('93', 365, 1, 4, 732826) But if it at all mended matters he was free to declare that he had found no evidence to support the figure of a thousand.
('93', 365, 1, 5, 732948) The figure was certainly much smaller.
('93', 365, 1, 6, 732987) He was also free to admit that the murders in number and brutalities in Bihar eclipsed those in Noakhali.
('93', 365, 1, 7, 733093) But that admission must not mean a call for him to go to Bihar.
('93', 365, 1, 8, 733157) He did not know that he could render any greater service by going to Bihar than from here.
('93', 365, 1, 9, 733248) He would not be worth anything if without conviction he went there at the bidding of anybody.
('93', 365, 1, 10, 733342) He would need no prompting, immediately he felt that his place was more in Bihar than in Noakhali.
('93', 365, 1, 11, 733441) He was where he thought he could render the greatest service to both the communities.

('93', 365, 3, 14, 733586) SRINAGAR CAMP, ADDRESS AS AT KAZIRKHIL, P. O. RAMGANJ, NOAKHALI, February 5, 1947
('93', 365, 4, 15, 733668) MY DEAR ANAND AND BHAKTI, It was a perfect delight to receive your letter.
('93', 365, 4, 16, 733743) It is interesting to hear about Mr. R.s 1 views.
('93', 365, 4, 17, 733792) What you said was perfectly true, namely, without purity of heart real non violence was impossible.
('93', 365, 4, 18, 733892) If Mr. R. is of opinion that purity of heart is not an essential of non violent conduct I would like to know the reason why he thinks so.
('93', 365, 4, 19, 734030) That the real non violent conduct of a person may well be followed in practice by the multitude is perfectly true.
('93', 365, 4, 20, 734145) Such was my case and is today.
('93', 365, 4, 21, 734176) But the prime mover has to be au fait with the science of non violence.
('93', 365, 4, 22, 734248) That Mr. R. may be an atheist would not matter if his conduct corresponds to that of a man of God.
('93', 365, 4, 23, 734347) Such for instance was Brad law 2 [sic].
('93', 365, 4, 24, 734387) His atheism was only so called.
('93', 365, 4, 25, 734419) He had faith in the moral

('93', 366, 1, 3, 734705) I was an eye witness because I attended the funeral myself.
('93', 366, 1, 4, 734765) 1 His body was cremated at Woking 2. I wonder if this answers your question.
('93', 366, 1, 5, 734842) If this does not you must tax me again.
('93', 366, 1, 6, 734882) My walking pilgrimage is going on steadily and it certainly gives me immense peace of mind.
('93', 366, 1, 7, 734974) The upshot I do not know, nor do I care to know.
('93', 366, 1, 8, 735023) Man has no control over results.
('93', 366, 1, 9, 735056) That is the sole prerogative of God.

('93', 366, 4, 13, 735198) Lead Thou me on.
('93', 366, 4, 14, 735215) You know the hymn, dont you?
('93', 366, 4, 15, 735244) The initial verse of the hymn is: Lead Kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom. I hope you will soon get your Harijan.
('93', 366, 4, 16, 735363) I am exceedingly sorry that you have been without it all these months.
('93', 366, 4, 17, 735434) I say months [as] it was revived only recently 3. I hope both of the babies are looking as young as when we first met.
('93', 366, 4, 18, 735553) Tell me when you think you will be ready to pay another visit to India.

('93', 366, 8, 22, 735821) Is there not a discrepancy between para 2 and para 45?
('93', 366, 8, 23, 735876) The reservation powers seem to me to be so great as virtually to neutralize the liberality of the promised constitution.

('93', 367, 4, 10, 736429) The news appears to be almost too good to be true and I am not going to believe it in its entirety unless you are physically in India.
('93', 367, 4, 11, 736564) Of course we shall, as we must, meet, no matter in what part of India I happen to be at the time.
('93', 367, 4, 12, 736662) My pilgrimage is the longest part of my life.
('93', 367, 4, 13, 736708) I am only hoping and praying that God will give me the strength to go through the fire.
('93', 367, 4, 14, 736796) Do or die was the motto given in 1942. It is the motto, having given it then, I must endeavour to live it myself.
('93', 367, 4, 15, 736910) I am glad you are to come via London and that for many reasons, besides seeing Lord Pethick Lawrence.
('93', 367, 4, 16, 737012) Many things will have happened here between now and October.

('93', 367, 7, 24, 737552) But it is well for you to know that such a man is at large in Noakhali.
('93', 367, 7, 25, 737624) He belongs to Malabar.
('93', 367, 7, 26, 737647) I am sorry for him.

('93', 368, 3, 4, 737946) VALLABHBHAI, I got your letter.
('93', 368, 3, 5, 737978) I made a long speech 1 about the League.
('93', 368, 3, 6, 738019) A report of it has been sent to the Press.
('93', 368, 3, 7, 738062) You may have read it in the newspapers.
('93', 368, 3, 8, 738102) It summarizes my views on the subject.
('93', 368, 3, 9, 738141) I take the Cabinet Mission statement to mean that there is nothing to fear if even the Princes do not join the Constituent Assembly.
('93', 368, 3, 10, 738274) Nothing will be lost even if they do not interpret it in the same way.
('93', 368, 3, 11, 738345) And if they do, it will only be worthy of them and we shall be able to work without obstruction.
('93', 368, 3, 12, 738442) It is as clear as daylight to me that there is no need to put up with shortages in food and cloth.
('93', 368, 3, 13, 738541) It is another matter if I cannot convince others about it.
('93', 368, 3, 14, 738600) In such circumstances it makes no difference whether or not I come there.
('93', 368, 3, 15, 738674) My place is here only.
('93', 368, 3, 16, 738697) I am satisfied with what I can do here.
('93', 368, 3, 17, 738737) I believe that I am bringing some little solace to the people here and may be able to bring more if I continue the work.
('93', 368, 3, 18, 738858) But that is in the hands of Providence.
('93', 368, 3, 19, 738898) I hear that your opposition is reported to be the reason why the Bihar Ministry does not appoint an inquiry commission.
('93', 368, 3, 20, 739018) 2 I do not believe the story, but I bring it to your notice.
('93', 368, 3, 21, 739079) If a commission is not appointed, it will do great harm.
('93', 368, 3, 22, 739136) The Ministry will be regarded as guilty.
('93', 368, 3, 23, 739177) If their work has been above board, what harm can the Commission do to them?
('93', 368, 3, 24, 739254) Considerable pressure is being exerted on me, but I do not go because I have reposed confidence in the Ministers.
('93', 368, 3, 25, 739368) But if a Commission is not appointed after all, I shall have no choice but to go to Bihar.

('93', 368, 4, 27, 739659) I do hold the opinion that there is no gain but only harm if the Commission is appointed.
('93', 368, 4, 28, 739749) If in spite of it a Commission is appointed, how can I prevent it?
('93', 368, 4, 29, 739816) The Bihar Governor is behind the non appointment of the Commission.

('93', 370, 5, 11, 741727) BHAI MAHMUD 2, The secretary of the Muslim League has written to me.
('93', 370, 5, 12, 741796) An extract from that letter is as follows :
('93', 370, 6, 13, 741840) I have reports that the Hindu mentality is so strong in the Congress Cabinet of the Bihar Government that even a Muslim colleague is avoided.
('93', 370, 6, 14, 741982) I am told that Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and Dr. Rajendra Prasad decided that Dr. Mahmood be entrusted with the relief operations in Bihar to inspire the lost Muslim confidence, still he is kept at arms length.
('93', 370, 7, 15, 742191) Please write to me whether this is correct and if it is what you have done in the matter.
('93', 370, 7, 16, 742281) The Secretary further writes :
('93', 370, 8, 17, 742312) One of your Ministers who undertook tour of the affected areas is Dr. Mahmood.
('93', 370, 8, 18, 742391) He can give you a true idea of the brutalities and damages.
('93', 370, 8, 19, 742451) We do not want to exaggerate the facts.
('93', 370, 8, 20, 742491) They are of such enormity that no one can honestly minimize their impact.
('93', 370, 8, 21, 742565) Even now the Government is callously indifferent.
('93', 370, 8, 22, 742615) They have lost the confidence of the Bihar Muslims.
('93', 370, 9, 23, 742667) Please let me know all the facts.

('93', 371, 2, 3, 742930) SRINAGAR, February 5, 1947
('93', 371, 3, 4, 742957) Gandhiji began his remarks by asking the volunteers to refrain from providing decorations and a kind of ornamental shade where he sat.
('93', 371, 3, 5, 743092) He was averse to all these things.
('93', 371, 3, 6, 743127) It was a waste of labour and money.
('93', 371, 3, 7, 743163) All that was needed was a raised seat with something clean and soft to rest his fatless and muscleless bones.
('93', 371, 3, 8, 743273) He wanted to deal that evening with a question that arose out of the meeting of the third instant but he could not deal with on the fourth as he had to deal with the statement read to him by the Muslim friends.
('93', 371, 3, 9, 743484) The question was as follows :
('93', 371, 4, 10, 743514) You have asked those provinces which have the necessary courage to frame their own constitutions and then ask the British army to quit their territory as proof of the attainment of independence.
('93', 371, 4, 11, 743709) What, in your opinion, should be the basis of the franchise in those free Provinces of India?
('93', 371, 4, 12, 743803) Should communal electorates be replaced by functional ones in the Assemblies?
('93', 371, 4, 13, 743881) Should there be functional instead of communal representation?
('93', 371, 4, 14, 743944) Should there be joint electorates with reservation of seats for communal minorities or functional groups?
('93', 371, 4, 15, 744050) Should there be favoured representation of any group for the time being?
('93', 371, 4, 16, 744123) If so, of what group?
('93', 371, 4, 17, 744145) Should we have joint electorate, and full adult franchise?
('93', 371, 5, 18, 744204) Gandhijis answer was unequivocal.
('93', 371, 5, 19, 744238) Even one Province could frame its own constitution and enforce it, provided that it was backed not by a majority of one but by an overwhelming majority.
('93', 371, 5, 20, 744391) Gandhiji held that no power on earth could resist the lovers of liberty who were ready not to kill opponents but to be killed by them.
('93', 371, 5, 21, 744526) This was the view that he had enunciated at one time.
('93', 371, 5, 22, 744580) 2 But today they had made considerable progress.
('93', 371, 5, 23, 744629) He put a favourable interpretation on the Cabinet Missions State Paper.
('93', 371, 5, 24, 744701) So far as he could see they could not resist the declared wish of a single province.
('93', 371, 5, 25, 744786) If that was true of one province, say Bengal, how much more was it so for a number of provinces which the Constituent Assembly undoubtedly represented?
('93', 371, 5, 26, 744938) But he was indifferent as to what the British Government said so far as Indias independence was concerned.
('93', 371, 5, 27, 745045) That rested with the people and with no outside power.
('93', 371, 5, 28, 745100) Nor was there any question as to what India would do if the State Paper was withdrawn.
('93', 371, 5, 29, 745187) India had been accustomed to a life in the wilderness.
('93', 371, 5, 30, 745242) When Pandit Nehru and his friends accepted office he had said that it was not a bed of roses but a bed of thorns.
('93', 371, 5, 31, 745356) Their goal was liberty and liberty they would have no matter what happened.
('93', 371, 6, 32, 745432) Naturally he could speak with confidence when the people had only non violence in view as a steadfast simple policy without reservation.

('93', 372, 1, 2, 745731) hand, they thought they could drive away the English by the sword they were vastly mistaken.
('93', 372, 1, 3, 745824) They did not know the determination and courage of the British.
('93', 372, 1, 4, 745888) They would not yield to the power of the sword.
('93', 372, 1, 5, 745936) But they could not withstand the courage of non violence which disdained to deal death against death.
('93', 372, 1, 6, 746038) He knew no other power higher than non violence.
('93', 372, 1, 7, 746087) And if they were still without real independence, it was, he was sure, because the people had not developed sufficient non violence.
('93', 372, 1, 8, 746220) Anyway, the State Paper in his opinion was in answer to the non violent strength that India had so far developed.
('93', 372, 2, 9, 746334) If they contemplated the last War, they would plainly see that whilst the enemy powers so called were crushed, the Allied Powers had won but an empty victory.
('93', 372, 2, 10, 746493) Apart from the wanton destruction of human heads, they hadbetween the Allies and the enemiessucceeded in draining the world of its food materials and cloth.
('93', 372, 2, 11, 746650) And the former seemed to be so dehumanized that they entertained the vain hope of reducing the enemies to helotry.
('93', 372, 2, 12, 746765) It was a question whom to pity morethe Allies or the enemies.
('93', 372, 2, 13, 746827) Therefore he asked the people bravely to face the consequence whatever it was, feeling secure in the confidence born of non violence, be it as an honest policy.
('93', 372, 3, 14, 746988) As to the franchise he swore by the franchise of all adults, males and females, above the age of twenty one or even eighteen.
('93', 372, 3, 15, 747114) He would bar old men like himself.
('93', 372, 3, 16, 747149) They were of no use as voters.
('93', 372, 3, 17, 747180) India and the rest of the world did not belong to those who were on the point of dying.
('93', 372, 3, 18, 747268) To them belonged death, life to the young.
('93', 372, 3, 19, 747311) Thus he would have a bar against persons beyond a certain age, say fifty, as he would against youngsters below eighteen.
('93', 372, 3, 20, 747432) Of course, he would debar lunatics and loafers.
('93', 372, 3, 21, 747480) Of course, in India free, he could not contemplate communal franchise.
('93', 372, 3, 22, 747551) It must be joint electorate, perhaps with reservation of seats.
('93', 372, 3, 23, 747615) Nor could he contemplate favouritism for anyone, say Muslims, Sikhs or Parsis, for example.
('93', 372, 3, 24, 747707) If there was to be favouritism he would single out physical lepers.
('93', 372, 3, 25, 747775) They were an outcome of the crimes of society.
('93', 372, 3, 26, 747822) If moral lepers would ban themselves, the physical lepers would soon be extinct.
('93', 372, 3, 27, 747903) And they, poor men, were so frightened of modern society that they put forth no claims.
('93', 372, 3, 28, 747991) Educate them truly and they would make ideal citizens.
('93', 372, 3, 29, 748046) Anyway, side by side with adult franchise or even before that he pleaded for universal education, not necessarily literary except perhaps as an aid.
('93', 372, 3, 30, 748195) English education, he was convinced, had starved their minds, enervated them and never prepared them for brave citizenship.
('93', 372, 3, 31, 748319) He would give them all sufficient knowledge in the rich languages of which any country would be proud.
('93', 372, 3, 32, 748422) Education in the understanding of the rights of citizenship was a short term affair if they were honest and earnest.

('93', 373, 8, 11, 748981) Q. Why should we insist on a Rabindranath 4 or a Raman 5 earning his bread by manual labour?
('93', 373, 8, 12, 749074) Is it not sheer wastage?
('93', 373, 8, 13, 749099) Why should not brain workers be considered on a par with manual workers, for both of them perform useful social work?
('93', 373, 9, 14, 749217) A. Intellectual work is important and has an undoubted place in the scheme of life.
('93', 373, 9, 15, 749301) But what I insist on is the necessity of physical labour.
('93', 373, 9, 16, 749359) No man, I claim, ought to be free from that obligation.
('93', 373, 9, 17, 749415) It will serve to improve even the quality of his intellectual output.
('93', 373, 9, 18, 749485) I venture to say that in ancient times Brahmins worked with their body as with their mind.
('93', 373, 9, 19, 749576) But even if they did not, body labour is a proved necessity at the present time.
('93', 373, 9, 20, 749657) In this connection I would refer to the life of Tolstoy and how he made famous the theory of bread labour first propounded in his country by the Russian peasant Bondaref.

('93', 375, 5, 11, 752680) Come if you must.
('93', 375, 5, 12, 752698) I do not see any good in it.
('93', 375, 5, 13, 752727) That will show that you have no trust in God  I still say that you should leave Manu and yourself in the hands of God.
('93', 375, 5, 14, 752846) I am giving it a lot of time.
('93', 375, 5, 15, 752876) The more you try the more complicated the situation will become.
('93', 375, 5, 16, 752941) There is nothing for you to explain.

('93', 376, 5, 10, 754341) DHARAMPUR, February 6, 1947
('93', 376, 6, 11, 754369) Gandhiji referred to a letter he had received from the Medical Superintendent of the Marwari Relief Society.
('93', 376, 6, 12, 754478) The doctor said that he treated both Hindus and Mussa lmans without any distinction.
('93', 376, 6, 13, 754563) Muslim men and women gladly accepted his services.
('93', 376, 6, 14, 754614) He noticed that in this part of the world the Muslims were poor.
('93', 376, 6, 15, 754679) There was dirt and insanitation wherever he went.
('93', 376, 6, 16, 754729) Would he (Gandhiji) say something about it?
('93', 376, 7, 17, 754773) He (Gandhiji) would gladly do so.
('93', 376, 7, 18, 754807) For he had been a lover of cleanliness and sanitation for over fifty years.
('93', 376, 7, 19, 754883) He had to speak much in disparagement of the West.
('93', 376, 7, 20, 754934) It was therefore a pleasure to him to be able to say that he had learnt the laws of cleanliness from Englishmen.
('93', 376, 7, 21, 755047) He was pained to see the same tanks in Noakhali used for drinking and cleaning purposes.
('93', 376, 7, 22, 755136) It was wrong.
('93', 376, 7, 23, 755150) The people thoughtlessly dirtied the streets, lanes and footpaths by spitting everywhere and clearing their noses.
('93', 376, 7, 24, 755265) This was the cause of many diseases in India.
('93', 376, 7, 25, 755311) No doubt, their chronic poverty was responsible for the diseases.
('93', 376, 7, 26, 755377) But their chronic breach of the laws of sanitation was no less responsible.
('93', 376, 7, 27, 755453) It was surprising that India lived at all.
('93', 376, 7, 28, 755496) But it was worst in point of high death rate.
('93', 376, 7, 29, 755542) America was probably the first in the list.
('93', 376, 7, 30, 755586) And then those that lived were specimens of living death.
('93', 376, 7, 31, 755644) The sooner therefore the inhabitants of Noakhali attended to the laws of sanitation the better for them.
('93', 376, 7, 32, 755749) Poverty was no bar to perfect sanitation.
('93', 376, 8, 33, 755791) Then there was an invasion of Pressmen from far and near.
('93', 376, 8, 34, 755849) The expression, Press Camp, was an attractive expression.
('93', 376, 8, 35, 755907) But this Press Camp was in keeping with the village surroundings and that too with his.
('93', 376, 8, 36, 755995) His surroundings were inconsistent with pomp.
('93', 376, 8, 37, 756041) The Pressmen who accompanied him were living under difficult conditions.
('93', 376, 8, 38, 756114) They had to live in such huts as the villagers were able to provide.
('93', 376, 9, 39, 756183) 1Vide also the following item.
('93', 376, 9, 40, 756214) 2 Extracted from Gandhijis Walking Tour Diary
('93', 377, 0, 1, 756260) 378 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('93', 377, 1, 2, 756302) had no unlimited accommodation.
('93', 377, 1, 3, 756334) He would advise them not to venture out but be satisfied with the news that the five or six were able to provide.
('93', 377, 1, 4, 756448) His barefoot walk need not provide sensation.
('93', 377, 1, 5, 756494) It ought not to excite people.
('93', 377, 1, 6, 756525) It was no difficulty for him.
('93', 377, 1, 7, 756555) The earth of Noakhali was like velvet and the green grass was a magnificent carpet to walk on.
('93', 377, 1, 8, 756650) It reminded him of the soft English grass he had noticed in England.
('93', 377, 1, 9, 756719) It was wholly unnecessary to wear sandals to be able to walk on the Noakhali earth and grass.
('93', 377, 1, 10, 756813) He could not probably have done it in Gujarat, and then he had inherited the traditions of his country.
('93', 377, 1, 11, 756917) A pilgrimage was always performed barefoot.
('93', 377, 1, 12, 756961) For him this tour was a pilgrimage pure and simple.
('93', 377, 1, 13, 757013) But that should be no attraction to Pressmen and others.
('93', 377, 1, 14, 757070) He considered it as no strain on him.
('93', 377, 1, 15, 757108) And if God willed it, He would allow him to pull through it.
('93', 377, 1, 16, 757169) Let the Pressmen save the time and money; the latter they could contribute to the Noakhali Relief Fund or the never to end Harijan Fund.
('93', 377, 2, 17, 757306) He then came to the questions put to him.
('93', 377, 3, 18, 757348) Q. Supposing one or the other of the provinces wishes to declare its independence, what kind of constitution would you advise them to prepare?
('93', 377, 3, 19, 757491) In 1925, you declared that in the Free India of your dreams only those would have voting rights who had contributed by manual labour to the service of the State.
('93', 377, 3, 20, 757653) Do you adhere to that advice today with regard to the above provinces?
('93', 377, 4, 21, 757724) A. Independence could be the same as for the whole of India.
('93', 377, 4, 22, 757785) He adhered to what he had said in 1925, viz., that all adults above a certain age, male or female, who would contribute some body labour to the State would be entitled to the vote.
('93', 377, 4, 23, 757966) Thus a simple labourer would easily be a voter whereas a millionaire or a lawyer or a merchant and the like would find it hard if they did not do some body labour for the State.
('93', 377, 5, 24, 758144) Q. If contiguous provinces in India do not declare such independence but scattered ones do so, would not the presence of the non federating units create difficulties for the rest in the matter of common action?
('93', 377, 6, 25, 758355) A. He saw no difficulty if the society was of his conception, that is, based on non violence.
('93', 377, 6, 26, 758449) Thus supposing populous Bengal with its gifted Tagores and Suhrawardys framed a constitution based on independence and Assam with its opium habit dreamed away life, Orissa with its skeletons had no wish and Bihar was occupied in family slaughter, they would all three be affected and covered by Bengal.
('93', 377, 6, 27, 758752) Such infectiousness was inherent in his scheme of independence which was friend to all and enemy to none.
('93', 377, 6, 28, 758858) It might well be that his was a voice in the wilderness.
('93', 377, 6, 29, 758915) If so, it was Indias misfortune.
('93', 377, 7, 30, 758948) Q. Do you expect the constitution of the free provinces to be made so attractive that others would voluntarily be drawn into it?
('93', 378, 0, 1, 759077) VOL. 93: 7 NOVEMBER, 1946 16 FEBRUARY, 1947 379
('93', 378, 1, 2, 759125) A. Attractiveness was inherent in everything that was inherently good.
('93', 378, 2, 3, 759196) Q. Supposing the whole of Group A forms a common constitution, do you think provinces which are now under Group B or C will be able to join A if they so desired?
('93', 378, 3, 4, 759358) A. It went without saying that if the Group A succeeded in framing a good constitution not only would it be open to B and C to join, they would irresistibly be drawn to it.
('93', 378, 4, 5, 759531) Q. What about the States?
('93', 378, 4, 6, 759557) Who will decide whether a State should join the Union or not: the present rulers or the people?
('93', 378, 4, 7, 759653) If it is to be the latter then what changes would you expect to be first made in the constitutions of the present States?
('93', 378, 5, 8, 759775) A. He was a mere humble ryot but he belonged to the many crores.
('93', 378, 5, 9, 759840) The Rajas were nominally 640, in reality they were probably less than 100. Whatever the number was, they were so few that in an awakened India, they could only exist as servants of the ryots not in name but in actual practice.
('93', 378, 5, 10, 760067) He did not share the fear underlying the question that the British would be so dishonest as to play the Rajas against the ryots.
('93', 378, 5, 11, 760196) That was not the note of the Cabinet Mission Paper.
('93', 378, 5, 12, 760248) But why should India depend upon the British Cabinet?
('93', 378, 5, 13, 760302) When India was ready, neither the British nor the Rajas, nor any combination of the Powers could keep India from her destined goal, her birthright, as the Lokamanya 1 would have said.

('93', 378, 7, 16, 760547) NIRMALBABU, I never succeeded in writing to you on your first personal letter.
('93', 378, 7, 17, 760626) The second on Bs relation with A now comes.
('93', 378, 7, 18, 760670) I must undertake this second today.
('93', 378, 7, 19, 760706) I sent your letter to A. You left it open for me to do so.
('93', 378, 7, 20, 760765) My loyalty to him demanded that I should.
('93', 378, 7, 21, 760807) B has led you into doing an injustice to A. I discussed it with her.
('93', 378, 7, 22, 760876) She saw the truth of it.
('93', 378, 7, 23, 760901) As love is wholly free from animal passion.
('93', 378, 7, 24, 760945) I have called it poetic.
('93', 378, 7, 25, 760970) It is not a perfect adjective but I can find no better.
('93', 378, 7, 26, 761026) He loved once a girl with the same passion with which he loves B. In either case, it was philanthropic.
('93', 378, 7, 27, 761130) The first came in a flash, the second took practically two years to discover.
('93', 378, 7, 28, 761208) He thought he would give B the best of him in point of education.
('93', 378, 7, 29, 761274) In his opinion both cases went wrong because of my initial aversion.
('93', 378, 7, 30, 761343) In the first, I relented when, as A thinks, it was too late.
('93', 378, 7, 31, 761404) In the second, it is almost

('93', 379, 1, 2, 761488) too late.
('93', 379, 1, 3, 761498) The first girl is married.
('93', 379, 1, 4, 761525) He is entitled to hope till B is married elsewhere, if she is.
('93', 379, 1, 5, 761588) So far as B knows herself, it is a sealed book.
('93', 379, 1, 6, 761636) Now mark the beauty of it.
('93', 379, 1, 7, 761663) A says so long as B does not change her mind, she will be as sister or daughter to him and [that he] would never make any other advances to her.
('93', 379, 1, 8, 761808) B believes this assurance, what she objects to is his shadowing her as she calls it.
('93', 379, 1, 9, 761893) If he does not get B as wife, he will never think of making love to another woman.
('93', 379, 1, 10, 761976) He is too pure to think of any such thing.
('93', 379, 1, 11, 762019) If you accept my analysis, you will render justice to A and lead B aright.
('93', 379, 1, 12, 762094) I do wish you could see that in non violent conduct, whether individual or universal, there is an indissoluble connection between private, personal life and public.
('93', 379, 1, 13, 762259) You may be as generous and charitable as you like in judging men, but you cannot overlook private deflections from the right conduct.
('93', 379, 1, 14, 762393) If you are convinced about this proposition, you should pursue my connection with Manu and if you find a flaw, try to show it to me.
('93', 379, 1, 15, 762526) I have written in order to save your time and to let you think.

('93', 380, 5, 9, 763420) PRASADPUR, February 7, 1947
('93', 380, 6, 10, 763448) QUESTION: You have always been against charity and have preached the doctrine that no man is free from the obligation of bread labour.
('93', 380, 6, 11, 763583) What is your advice for people who are engaged in sedentary occupations but lost their all in the last riots?
('93', 380, 6, 12, 763693) Should they migrate and try to find a place where they can go back to their old accustomed habits of life or should they try to remodel their life in conformity with your ideal of bread labour for everybody?
('93', 380, 6, 13, 763901) What use shall their special talents be in that case?
('93', 380, 7, 14, 763955) In reply, Gandhiji said that it was true that for years he had been against charity as it was understood and that he had for years preached the duty of bread labour.
('93', 380, 7, 15, 764121) In this connection he mentioned the visit he had had from the District Magistrate and Zaman Saheb along with a police officer.
('93', 380, 7, 16, 764248) They wanted his opinion about giving doles to the refugees.
('93', 380, 7, 17, 764308) They had already decided to put before them the work of removal of the water hyacinth, repair of roads, village reconstruction or straightening out their own plots of land or building on their lands.
('93', 380, 7, 18, 764508) Those who did any one of these things had a perfect right to rations.
('93', 380, 7, 19, 764578) He said that he liked the idea.
('93', 380, 7, 20, 764610) But as a practical idealist he would not take the refugees by storm.
('93', 380, 7, 21, 764679) A variety of work should be put before the people and they should have one months notice that if they made no choice of the occupations suggested, nor did they suggest some other acceptable occupation but declined to do any work though their bodies were fit, they would be reluctantly obliged to tell the refugees that they would not be able to give them doles after the expiry of the notice.
('93', 380, 7, 22, 765072) He advised the refugees and their friends to render full co operation to the Government in such a scheme of work.
('93', 380, 7, 23, 765186) It was wrong for any citizen to expect rations without doing some physical work.
('93', 380, 8, 24, 765267) He could never advise people to leave their homes.
('93', 380, 8, 25, 765318) He would like even one solitary Hindu to feel safe under any circumstances and would expect the Muslims to make him perfectly safe in their midst.
('93', 380, 8, 26, 765465) He should welcome them to worship God in

('93', 381, 1, 2, 765594) the way they knew.
('93', 381, 1, 3, 765613) He certainly did not consider money got through speculation as rightly gained.
('93', 381, 1, 4, 765692) Nor did he consider it impossible for man to shed bad or evil habits at any time.
('93', 381, 1, 5, 765774) If everybody lived by the sweat of his brow, the earth would become a paradise.
('93', 381, 1, 6, 765854) The question of the use of special talents hardly needed separate consideration.
('93', 381, 1, 7, 765935) If everyone laboured physically for his bread, it followed that poets, doctors, lawyers, etc., would regard it their duty to use those talents gratis for the service of humanity.
('93', 381, 1, 8, 766114) Their output will be all the better and richer for their selfless devotion to duty.

('93', 381, 3, 11, 766251) It is with sadness that I write this preface to the new edition of Ashram Bhajanavali.
('93', 381, 3, 12, 766338) Its compiler was the late Shri Khare Shastri 1. I do not feel myself equal to the task.
('93', 381, 3, 13, 766426) But this much I can say that the primary aim of the collection was to sustain right conduct.
('93', 381, 3, 14, 766519) Let it also be remembered that it has brought together a group of people who for years have been reciting these hymns 2 with great devotion.
('93', 381, 3, 15, 766660) And, thirdly, it has not restricted itself to any particular sect or religion.
('93', 381, 3, 16, 766739) Gems available from all places have been collected.
('93', 381, 3, 17, 766791) Therefore many Hindus, Muslims, Christians and others, recite from it with pleasure and derive whatever moral sustenance they can.
('93', 381, 3, 18, 766922) Shri Kishorelal Mashruwala has taken great pains to translate the Sanskrit verses.

('93', 382, 1, 2, 767588) due notice (at least one month) of their stoppage is given to the refugees that they will be stopped unless one of the specified items of work is done by them against the rations which should be adequate and medically fit for consumption.
('93', 382, 1, 3, 767827) The items should include : 1. Road construction or road repair for at least two hours per day, Sundays excluded.
('93', 382, 1, 4, 767940) 2. Removal of water hyacinth for the same period as in (1), under supervision.
('93', 382, 1, 5, 768019) 3. House building on their own vacated lands for the same period as in (1), with material and tools supplied by the Government.
('93', 382, 1, 6, 768147) 4. Village reconstruction for the same period as in (1).
('93', 382, 1, 7, 768204) 5. Cleaning of tanks for the same period as in (1).
('93', 382, 1, 8, 768256) 6. Hand spinning for four hours per day, cotton and wheel or takli being supplied by the Government; spinning to include ginning, carding or tunai or punai.
('93', 382, 1, 9, 768413) 7. Weaving for the same period as in (6), tools and accessories and yarn, double twisted in the case of hand spun, being supplied by the Government.
('93', 382, 1, 10, 768562) 8. Dhenki husking, same period as in (1), dhenkis being supplied by the Government.
('93', 382, 1, 11, 768646) 9. Oil pressing out of coconut or seeds supplied by the Government.
('93', 382, 1, 12, 768714) 10. Any other village craft chosen by the Government or refugees, approved by the Government for the period as in (1) or (6) as the case may be.
('93', 382, 1, 13, 768859) Efficient working of the foregoing is wholly dependent upon a well thought out scheme capably managed by the Government.
('93', 382, 1, 14, 768980) This is no famine measure.
('93', 382, 1, 15, 769007) It is conceived wholly in the spirit of the maxim, no labour no food.
('93', 382, 1, 16, 769077) No breakdown in transport or other Government machinery should stop the supply of rations to the helpless unfortunate sufferers.
('93', 382, 1, 17, 769206) I would suggest that refugees who are not willing or are otherwise incapable may be supplied rations against payment at fixed rates.
('93', 382, 1, 18, 769339) The time for ploughing for the next crop is soon ebbing away.
('93', 382, 1, 19, 769401) Therefore agricultural implements, bullocks and seeds have to be supplied at once or disaster may have to be faced.

('93', 384, 6, 9, 771594) NANDIGRAM, February 8, 1947
('93', 384, 7, 10, 771622) Q. The Mussalmans are boycotting the Hindus.
('93', 384, 7, 11, 771667) Those Hindus who possess more land than they can till themselves are in a serious difficulty.
('93', 384, 7, 12, 771761) What is your advice to them?
('93', 384, 7, 13, 771790) What will they do about the surplus land which they hold but cannot till themselves, even if they take up the plough themselves?
('93', 384, 8, 14, 771919) A. In answer Gandhiji said that he had heard of the boycott and had made some remarks at previous meetings.
('93', 384, 8, 15, 772027) He hoped, indeed he knew, that the boycott was not universal in Noakhali.
('93', 384, 8, 16, 772101) It was probably confined to a few.
('93', 384, 8, 17, 772136) Whatever the extent, he had no doubt that it was wrong and would do no good to the boycotters as it could not to those against whom it was directed.
('93', 384, 8, 18, 772285) That opinion was held by him for a large number of years, say sixty.
('93', 384, 8, 19, 772354) But there was a condition in which he would conceive it possible, i.
('93', 384, 8, 20, 772423) e., if the Muslims regarded the Hindus as their enemies and wished to avoid their presence in Noakhali.
('93', 384, 8, 21, 772527) That would amount to a declaration of war from which every Indian would recoil with horror.
('93', 384, 8, 22, 772619) In isolated cases, his opinion was emphatic.
('93', 384, 8, 23, 772664) The Hindu under the boycott would allow his land to lie fallow like the Australians or he would sell the surplus land.
('93', 384, 8, 24, 772783) What was best was that nobody should possess more than he could himself use.
('93', 384, 8, 25, 772860) That was the ideal the society should strive to reach.
('93', 384, 9, 26, 772915) Q. You have been working here for the last three months.
('93', 384, 9, 27, 772972) Has there been any appreciable change in the mentality of the Hindus?
('93', 384, 10, 28, 773042) A. The question could best be answered by the Hindus concerned.
('93', 384, 10, 29, 773106) He flattered himself with the belief that the Hindus had, at least for the time being, shed their cowardice to an extent.
('93', 384, 11, 30, 773228) Q. There is certainly a peace loving section among the Mussalmans.
('93', 384, 11, 31, 773295) After your presence in their midst, have they been influenced to such an extent that they are able to assert themselves against the worse element in their own community?
('93', 384, 12, 32, 773465) A. As to this third question he was glad that the questioner admitted that

('93', 385, 0, 1, 773586) 386 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('93', 385, 1, 2, 773628) there was a peace loving section among the Muslims of Noakhali.
('93', 385, 1, 3, 773692) It would be monstrous if there was not.
('93', 385, 1, 4, 773732) Whether they had developed courage to oppose the bad and mischievous element in Muslim society, he would give the same answer that he gave to the second question.
('93', 385, 1, 5, 773895) The Muslim friends could reply with certainty.
('93', 385, 1, 6, 773942) But he was vain enough to believe that several Muslim friends had been so affected.
('93', 385, 1, 7, 774026) As for instance, the Muslim witnesses in Bhatialpur declared that the destroyed mandir 1 he had opened 2 they would defend against destruction in future with their lives.
('93', 385, 1, 8, 774197) There were other consoling instances he had met with during his tour.
('93', 385, 2, 9, 774267) Q. Several workers are engaged in village work according to your direction.
('93', 385, 2, 10, 774343) what had been the result of their work on the local Hindu or Muslim population?
('93', 385, 2, 11, 774423) If you had not been here, would their influence have been equal to what it is at present?
('93', 385, 2, 12, 774513) Will the present influence of your workers be of a lasting character?
('93', 385, 3, 13, 774583) A. As to this fourth question Gandhiji said that if he was pure and meant what he said, his work was bound to survive his death.
('93', 385, 3, 14, 774712) He believed that there must be perfect correspondence between private and public conduct.
('93', 385, 3, 15, 774802) Similarly, if his associates were actuated purely by the spirit of service and were pure within and without and were not dominated by the glamour that surrounded him, they would work on with unabated zeal and their joint work would flourish with time.
('93', 385, 3, 16, 775054) He had never subscribed to the superstition that any good work died with the workers death.
('93', 385, 3, 17, 775146) On the contrary, all true and solid work made the worker immortal by the survival of his work after his death.

('93', 385, 6, 22, 775377) I have read them today.
('93', 385, 6, 23, 775401) Todays lesson is also long.
('93', 385, 6, 24, 775429) She cannot digest such long lessons.
('93', 385, 6, 25, 775466) She must be given short lessons and the handwriting should be big and beautiful like beads.
('93', 385, 6, 26, 775558) Even I am not able to read these.
('93', 385, 6, 27, 775592) There should not be so much scratching.
('93', 385, 6, 28, 775632) She has made this complaint twice or thrice before.
('93', 385, 6, 29, 775684) I have asked her to write herself.
('93', 385, 6, 30, 775719) What I have written is only on my behalf.
('93', 385, 6, 31, 775761) But Manu has seen it and she approves of it.

('93', 386, 10, 23, 776754) BIJOYNAGAR, February 9, 1947
('93', 386, 11, 24, 776783) Q. It has been our experience that a worker becomes power loving after some time.
('93', 386, 11, 25, 776865) How are the rest of his co workers to keep him in check?
('93', 386, 11, 26, 776922) In other words, how are we to preserve the democratic character of the organization?
('93', 386, 11, 27, 777007) We have found that non co operation with the party in question does not help.
('93', 386, 11, 28, 777085) The work of the organization itself suffers.
('93', 386, 12, 29, 777130) A. This is not your experience alone; it is almost universal.
('93', 386, 12, 30, 777192) Love of power is usual in man and often it only dies with his death.
('93', 386, 13, 31, 777261) 1 This appeared under the title, Some Important Questions with the following editorial note : Gandhiji dealt with some questions that were sent to him during the day.
('93', 386, 13, 32, 777428) It being his day of silence, he wrote out the answers which were read out at the prayer meeting.
('93', 387, 0, 1, 777525) 388 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('93', 387, 1, 2, 777567) Therefore, it is difficult for co workers to keep him in check, if only because they are more likely than not to have the same human frailty; and so long as we do not know a single completely non violent organization in the world, we cannot claim to know the utterly democratic character of an organization because, as can be definitely proved, no perfect democracy is possible without perfect non violence at the back of it.
('93', 387, 1, 3, 777993) The question would be proper if non co operation was violent as it often, if not invariably, is.
('93', 387, 1, 4, 778090) Claiming to know somewhat from experience the non violent character of non co operation, I suggest that given a good cause, non violent non co operation must succeed and no organization can suffer through offering non violent non co operation.
('93', 387, 1, 5, 778334) The questioner labours under the difficulty of having experience of non co operation, at best partially non violent, at its worst bare faced violence sailing under the name of non violence.
('93', 387, 1, 6, 778524) The pages of the Harijan and Young India are filled with instances of abortive non co operation, because of these two vital defects, non violence being partial or totally absent.
('93', 387, 1, 7, 778703) During my long experience, I also noticed that those who complain of others being ambitious of holding power are no less ambitious themselves, and when it is a question of distinguishing between half a dozen and six, it becomes a thankless task.
('93', 387, 2, 8, 778949) Q. In almost all villages there are parties and factions.
('93', 387, 2, 9, 779007) When we draft local help, whether we wish it or not, we become involved in local power politics.
('93', 387, 2, 10, 779104) How can we steer clear of this difficulty?
('93', 387, 2, 11, 779147) Should we try to bypass both parties and carry on work with the help of outside workers?
('93', 387, 2, 12, 779236) Our experience has been that such work becomes entirely contingent upon outside aid and crumbles down as soon as the latter is withdrawn.
('93', 387, 2, 13, 779374) What should we do then to develop local initiative and foster local co operation?
('93', 387, 3, 14, 779456) A. Alas for India that parties and factions are to be found in the villages as they are to be found in our cities.
('93', 387, 3, 15, 779571) And when power politics enters our villages with less thought of the welfare of the villages and more of using them for increasing the parties own power, this becomes a hindrance to the progress of the villagers rather than a help.
('93', 387, 3, 16, 779803) I would say that whatever be the consequence, we must make use as much as possible of local help and if we are free from the taint of power politics, we are not likely to go wrong.
('93', 387, 3, 17, 779984) Let us remember that the English educated men and women from the cities have criminally neglected the villages of India which are the backbone of the country.
('93', 387, 3, 18, 780143) The process of remembering our neglect will induce patience.
('93', 387, 3, 19, 780204) I have never gone to a single village which is devoid of an honest worker.
('93', 388, 0, 1, 780279) VOL. 93: 7 NOVEMBER, 1946 16 FEBRUARY, 1947 389
('93', 388, 1, 2, 780327) fail to find him when we are not humble enough to recognize any merit in our villagers.
('93', 388, 1, 3, 780415) Of course, we are to steer clear of local politics and this we shall learn to do when we accept help from all parties and no parties, wherever it is really good.
('93', 388, 1, 4, 780577) I would regard it as fatal for success to bypass villagers.
('93', 388, 1, 5, 780637) As I knew this very difficulty, I have tried rigidly to observe the rule of one village one worker, except that where he or she does not know Bengali, an interpreters help has been given.
('93', 388, 1, 6, 780825) I can only say that this system has so far answered the purpose.
('93', 388, 1, 7, 780890) I must, therefore, discount your experiences.
('93', 388, 1, 8, 780936) I would further suggest that we have got into the vicious habit of coming to hasty conclusions.
('93', 388, 1, 9, 781032) Before pronouncing such a sweeping condemnation as is implied in the sentence that work becomes entirely contingent upon outside aid and crumbles down as soon as the latter is withdrawn, I would go so far as to say that even a few years experience of residence in a single village, trying to work through local workers, should not be regarded as conclusive proof that work could not be done through and by local workers.
('93', 388, 1, 10, 781453) The contrary is obviously true.
('93', 388, 1, 11, 781485) It now becomes unnecessary for me to examine the last sentence in detail.
('93', 388, 1, 12, 781559) I can categorically say to the principal worker: If you have any outside help, get rid of it.
('93', 388, 1, 13, 781653) Work singly, courageously, intelligently with all local help you can get and, if you do not succeed, blame only yourself and no one else and nothing else.
('93', 388, 2, 14, 781808) Q. If we are to start khadi work in the devastated areas in Noakhali, should we begin with financial and technical aid from outside or slowly build up the whole structure with local men and money alone?
('93', 388, 3, 15, 782011) A. I will say in your own words: Slowly build up the whole structure with local men and money taking care to make yourself sure that you know the whole art of spinning in the widest sense I have given to the term.
('93', 388, 3, 16, 782225) What that sense is you should learn from my writings in the Harijan which you will do if you have the requisite eagerness.
('93', 388, 4, 17, 782348) Q. The cultivators and land owners who used to have their land tilled by Muslim labour have lost two crops namely mircha (long pepper), til seeds and mustard seeds owing to the loot of agricultural implements and bullocks and want of labour from Muslims.
('93', 388, 4, 18, 782603) The time for ploughing fields for the next boro and aus crop is impending and unless the cultivators get these within fifteen days, they will almost lose that crop also.
('93', 388, 5, 19, 782773) A. This is most unfortunate if it is true.
('93', 388, 5, 20, 782816) I have no doubt that all such land should be put under cultivation not only for the sake of the
('93', 389, 0, 1, 782912) 390 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('93', 389, 1, 2, 782954) owners but also for the State, which is or should be more concerned with the cultivation of food crops even than the owners.
('93', 389, 1, 3, 783079) Therefore the owners should ask the authorities for this assistance and the State should see to it that all such land is beneficially cultivated.
('93', 389, 1, 4, 783225) It is the duty of the State to ask and encourage Muslim labour to render this essential service whether the owner be a Muslim or a Hindu.
('93', 389, 1, 5, 783363) The State should certainly see that all labour is adequately paid by fixing the wages.

('93', 390, 2, 3, 784687) VINOBA, I do not at all feel happy in having to take your time, but you are being drawn into this.
('93', 390, 2, 4, 784786) The friends in our circle have been very much upset because of Manus sleeping with me.
('93', 390, 2, 5, 784873) Kishorelals agony is difficult to bear.
('93', 390, 2, 6, 784913) He is so upset that he is on the verge of breaking down.
('93', 390, 2, 7, 784970) The same is the case with Narahari and Swami 1. I do not know how the women at Sevagram and elsewhere must be suffering.
('93', 390, 2, 8, 785091) Here, on the contrary, everybody knows what is happening but I see no sign of its having any effect.
('93', 390, 2, 9, 785192) Maybe that prevents me from feeling the full impact of peoples reactions.
('93', 390, 2, 10, 785266) I keep playing with such fancies, for the co workers pain makes me lose confidence in myself.
('93', 390, 2, 11, 785360) My own mind, however, is becoming firmer than ever, for it has been my belief for a long time that that alone is true brahmacharya which requires no hedges.
('93', 390, 2, 12, 785517) My experiments arose from this belief.
('93', 390, 2, 13, 785556) I did make mistakes inthem.
('93', 390, 2, 14, 785584) Unthinking imitation may also have harmed the persons concerned.
('93', 390, 2, 15, 785649) But I am not conscious of myself having fallen.
('93', 390, 2, 16, 785697) Manus sleeping with me is not a part of my experiment, but is a part of the present yajna.
('93', 390, 2, 17, 785788) My mind daily sleeps in an innocent manner with millions of women, and Manu also, who is a blood relation to me, sleeps with me as one of these millions.
('93', 390, 2, 18, 785942) If she stops doing that out of deference to custom or to please co workers, would I not be a hypocrite of the type described in chapter III [of the Gita]?
('93', 390, 2, 19, 786097) If I do not appear to people exactly as I am within, wouldnt that be a blot on my non violence?
('93', 390, 2, 20, 786193) I go to this length: Suppose that non violence has no effect on the people here and I die.
('93', 390, 2, 21, 786284) If I dont let Manu sleep with me, though I regard it as essential that she should, wouldnt that be a sign of weakness in me, and in that case would not my death, since I would have failed to realize perfect ahimsa, be the best thing for me?
('93', 390, 2, 22, 786525) In other words, would not my experiment in ahimsa and truth remain incomplete or be tainted?
('93', 390, 2, 23, 786618) Perhaps I have not expressed this last thought clearly.
('93', 390, 2, 24, 786674) I referred to the subject in three speeches 2 of mine.

('93', 391, 1, 5, 786947) I have, therefore, sent to co workers copies of the extracts which have appeared.
('93', 391, 1, 6, 787029) I am sending one to you also.
('93', 391, 1, 7, 787059) Please let me have, your view.
('93', 391, 2, 8, 787090) How is Krishnachandra doing?
('93', 391, 2, 9, 787119) Ask him to write to me.
('93', 391, 2, 10, 787143) How are you?
('93', 391, 2, 11, 787156) I finished this letter at 6.15 a.
('93', 391, 2, 12, 787190) local time, that is, 5.15 a.
('93', 391, 2, 13, 787219) according to our own time.

('93', 391, 6, 17, 787356) BIJOYANAGAR, Monday, February 10, 1947 You must discover a remedy for this cold of yours.
('93', 391, 6, 18, 787446) Ramanama is an unfailing remedy.
('93', 391, 6, 19, 787479) If so, it must cure the cold.
('93', 391, 6, 20, 787509) Remember you had to admit this only a little while ago.
('93', 391, 6, 21, 787565) I think you should wrap something round your chest and throat.
('93', 391, 6, 22, 787628) Whatever it may be there is a law concerning Ramanama which brooks no exception, namely, that Natures laws must not be violated.
('93', 391, 6, 23, 787757) Learn to bear this in mind.

('93', 391, 9, 27, 787850) BIJOYNAGAR, February 10, 1947
('93', 391, 10, 28, 787880) At the outset Gandhiji referred to the fact that he was to go to Gopinathpur and was assured that it was no more than one and a half miles.
('93', 391, 10, 29, 788020) He began his trek but Gopinathpur seemed to be receding from view.
('93', 391, 10, 30, 788087) When they had walked for forty five minutes he said he should go no further if he was not to collapse.
('93', 391, 10, 31, 788190) He therefore, retraced his steps.
('93', 391, 10, 32, 788224) It took full one hour and twenty minutes which was too much for
('93', 391, 11, 33, 788288) 1 The addressee in his letter dated February 25, 1947, replied that he did not agree with Gandhiji on this issue, as any consciousness of the difference between man and woman was contrary to ideal brahmacharya.
('93', 391, 11, 34, 788499) But he did not wish to argue.
('93', 391, 11, 35, 788529) 2 Extracted from Gandhijis Walking Tour Diary
('93', 392, 0, 1, 788575) VOL. 93: 7 NOVEMBER, 1946 16 FEBRUARY, 1947 393
('93', 392, 1, 2, 788623) In future, those who invited him to walk to a place should measure the time taken by a leisurely walk.
('93', 392, 1, 3, 788726) He tendered his apology to the Hindus and Muslims of Gopinathpur and they owed an apology to Noakhali for not having been accurate and precise in their speech.
('93', 392, 1, 4, 788886) He incidentally mentioned that the people were found to have blown their noses on the path.
('93', 392, 1, 5, 788978) This was dangerous and dirty, especially for a people who had the habit of walking barefoot.
('93', 392, 1, 6, 789071) A friend had told him that he found a Muslim trader who had proper scales and a Hindu who had improper scales and asked him whether it wasnot true that the Muslim traders were honest and the Hindu traders dishonest.
('93', 392, 1, 7, 789287) He was sure that the inference was wrong.
('93', 392, 1, 8, 789329) In this imperfect world no community was wholly honest or dishonest.
('93', 392, 1, 9, 789398) All he could say was that a man who sported false scales for deceiving his customers was a criminal.
('93', 392, 1, 10, 789499) But he could not take it upon himself to condemn the whole group or community.
('93', 392, 2, 11, 789578) Q. You have said that you will stay here as long as perfect peace and amity between the two communities was not established and that you will die here if necessary.
('93', 392, 2, 12, 789743) Do you not think that such a long stay here will unnecessarily focus Indian and world attention on Noakhali, leading people to think that excesses still continued to be committed here, whereas on the contrary no unseemly acts have been committed by Mussalmans for sometime now?
('93', 392, 3, 13, 790021) A. No impartial observer could draw the mischievous inference from his presence.
('93', 392, 3, 14, 790102) He was there as their friend and servant.
('93', 392, 3, 15, 790144) His presence had certainly advertised Noakhali as a beautiful place which would be a paradise on earth if the Hindus and the Muslims lived in hearty friendship.
('93', 392, 3, 16, 790305) It may be that at the end of the chapter he might be noted down as a failure who knew very little about ahimsa.
('93', 392, 3, 17, 790417) Moreover, it was impossible for him to stay in Noakhali if the Hindus and the Muslims satisfied him that they had established hearty friendship between themselves.
('93', 392, 3, 18, 790581) He was sorry to tell them that he had evidence to show that things were not quite as they should be.
('93', 392, 4, 19, 790682) Q. Dont you think that the Hindus are artificially keeping up the appearance of tension by staying away from their homes in spite of promises of good behaviour by the Mussalmans which they have also made good in cases where they have been given an opportunity?
('93', 392, 5, 20, 790943) A. He did not think that many Hindus were wilfully staying away from their homes.
('93', 392, 5, 21, 791025) No one would want to be away from his home without attractive inducements.
('93', 392, 5, 22, 791100) He had heard nothing of such inducements.
('93', 392, 5, 23, 791142) But he knew that fright and the absence of the wherewithal were keeping them back.
('93', 392, 5, 24, 791225) Nevertheless, he was assured by the officials that the number returning was satisfactory.
('93', 392, 5, 25, 791315) They could not cope with a greater number.
('93', 392, 5, 26, 791358) When these obvious causes were present there was no occasion to draw far fetched inferences which could not be proved.
('93', 392, 5, 27, 791477) If, however, there were any
('93', 393, 0, 1, 791505) 394 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('93', 393, 1, 2, 791547) instigators keeping them back, the law was there to punish them.
('93', 393, 1, 3, 791612) The proof of the pudding was in the eating.
('93', 393, 1, 4, 791656) If it was true that the general body of the Muslims really wanted the refugees back, he was quite sure they would gladly return.
('93', 393, 1, 5, 791785) But the picture was not so rosy as was painted by the questioner.
('93', 393, 2, 6, 791851) Q. Dont you think that the dictates of non violence and friendship to all demand withdrawal or dropping of cases against the Mussalmans?
('93', 393, 3, 7, 791988) A. He did not know that there was much non violence in the air.
('93', 393, 3, 8, 792052) Even non violent conduct could not arrest the course of law.
('93', 393, 3, 9, 792113) And non violent conduct on the part of the frightened injured party could not operate until the culprits declared themselves and were penitent.
('93', 393, 3, 10, 792257) The fact was that not only was there no penitence on their part, but they were absconding.
('93', 393, 3, 11, 792348) He was averse to mass arrests.
('93', 393, 3, 12, 792379) And he was for severe punishment of those who were proved to have manufactured complaints.
('93', 393, 4, 13, 792470) Q. Is not the double faced policy of the Cabinet Mission at the root of the present trouble between the League and the Congress and ultimately between the Muslims and the Hindus?
('93', 393, 5, 14, 792649) A. He would not accuse the Cabinet Mission of double dealing.
('93', 393, 5, 15, 792711) They had honestly suggested a solution which in their opinion was fair.
('93', 393, 5, 16, 792783) The beauty of the Paper was that it contained no compulsion.
('93', 393, 5, 17, 792844) Naturally, after acceptance the clauses became obligatory for the accepting party.
('93', 393, 5, 18, 792927) But any party could refuse acceptance.
('93', 393, 5, 19, 792966) Thus if Assam in the east and Baluchistan in the west rejected the Grouping, no power on earth could compel them under the Cabinet Mission Paper.
('93', 393, 5, 20, 793112) Lastly, assuming that the Cabinet Mission Paper was a trap, why should the Congress and the League fall into it?
('93', 393, 6, 21, 793225) Q. Pakistan means complete independence for the Muslims in the Muslim majority Provinces and for the Hindus in Hindu majority Provinces.
('93', 393, 6, 22, 793362) Why then does the Congress object to it?
('93', 393, 7, 23, 793403) A. The answer was simple.
('93', 393, 7, 24, 793429) If Pakistan meant independence only to the Muslims in the Muslim majority provinces and vice versa, it was summarily rejected.
('93', 393, 7, 25, 793556) Happily not one Muslim leader, certainly not the Qaid e Azam, had ever given that meaning.
('93', 393, 7, 26, 793647) Were the Hindus in Bihar to be independent and the Muslims helots?
('93', 393, 7, 27, 793714) Or were the Hindus to be helots in Bengal?
('93', 393, 7, 28, 793757) He hoped not.
('93', 393, 8, 29, 793771) Q. Can there be any hope of establishing Hindu Muslim unity here in spite of the Congress League differences which are at the root of all the troubles everywhere?
('93', 393, 8, 30, 793934) Even if it is established, how long can it be expected to last?
('93', 393, 9, 31, 793998) A. He admitted that Hindu Muslim unity could not be sustained in the face of Congress League differences.
('93', 393, 9, 32, 794104) He hoped, however, that apart from party politics, whilst there was time, the Hindus and the Muslims in Noakhali would act together as real friends.
('93', 393, 9, 33, 794253) They should set an example to all India and especially to the League and the Congress.
('93', 393, 9, 34, 794340) Anyway, that was the mission that brought him to Noakhali.
('93', 394, 0, 1, 794399) VOL. 93: 7 NOVEMBER, 1946 16 FEBRUARY, 1947 395
('93', 394, 1, 2, 794447) wanted to pass his examination in pure ahimsa.
('93', 394, 1, 3, 794494) If it was pure, it must result in establishing that friendship which he desired at heart.
('93', 394, 1, 4, 794584) Therefore, if it was not established, the failure would be his.
('93', 394, 1, 5, 794648) And as ahimsa knew no failure, he had said he would do or die in Noakhali.
('93', 394, 1, 6, 794723) Let the questioner and those who thought like him help the fruition of the effort.

('93', 394, 3, 9, 794854) HAMCHANDI, February 11, 1947
('93', 394, 4, 10, 794883) QUESTION: A Bill 1 has been introduced in the Bengal Assembly which contemplates reduction of the landlords share from one half to one third of the crop in certain cases.
('93', 394, 4, 11, 795054) According to the new proposal, a farmer who has been in service on his masters land on or after December 22, 1946 cannot be ousted from the land for a term of three years.
('93', 394, 4, 12, 795226) Muslim farmers on the char lands have suddenly developed extraordinary enthusiasm for securing land on the barga system from Hindu land owners.
('93', 394, 4, 13, 795370) Many of the so called owners in char lands are in fact farmers themselves, only they left the land in charge of the bargadars (tenants) when they fled during the riots in October last.
('93', 394, 4, 14, 795555) Muslim farmers cannot just now be ousted from the land as the crop will not mature till about the month of June.
('93', 394, 4, 15, 795668) Hindus will, therefore, lose possession of the land for the next three years at least if the Bill becomes law.
('93', 394, 4, 16, 795779) Now that Hindu farmers are once more coming back to their lands, what should they do in order not to lose their agricultural occupation through the vagaries of the law?
('93', 394, 5, 17, 795948) ANSWER: It is improper to die before ones death.
('93', 394, 5, 18, 795997) Let them wait till the Bill becomes law.
('93', 394, 5, 19, 796038) Yet, I would advise them to welcome reduction of the landlords share from one half to one third.
('93', 394, 5, 20, 796135) The time is coming when all lands will belong to the State, that is, to the labourer on the land.
('93', 394, 5, 21, 796233) This is not to be looked upon as a communal question.
('93', 394, 5, 22, 796287) It may be that the landlords are Hindus in Noakhali.
('93', 394, 5, 23, 796340) But if the legislation is sound, it should not matter whom it affects.
('93', 394, 5, 24, 796411) I have serious doubts as to the propriety of not ousting labourers for a period of three years.
('93', 394, 5, 25, 796507) I would want to see the proposed legislation.
('93', 394, 5, 26, 796553) As to the alleged usurpation of land by the Muslims, in my opinion, that is indefensible, if true.
('93', 394, 5, 27, 796652) Let there be authentic instances and I have no doubt that the grievances would be remedied.
('93', 394, 5, 28, 796744) No Government of the people can, for a moment, tolerate usurpation.
('93', 394, 5, 29, 796812) If there are Muslims who had tilled the land that was unoccupied by reason of the
('93', 394, 6, 30, 796894) 1 Bargadars (Land Tenancy) Bill
('93', 395, 0, 1, 796926) 396 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('93', 395, 1, 2, 796968) disturbances, all that the tiller could claim is wages for the work done on the land.
('93', 395, 1, 3, 797054) In reality, if he tilled the land for his neighbour who was in adversity, it would be a neighbourly act for which there could be no remuneration.
('93', 395, 1, 4, 797200) Any such proved usurpation has to be reported to get remedied.
('93', 395, 2, 5, 797263) Q. You have advised both men and women to turn into voluntary labourers to hold no more land than they can till themselves.
('93', 395, 2, 6, 797387) But under our present social system in which the State does not take responsibility for the education of the young and the maintenance of the aged and the infirm when there is none else to look after them, these expenses are paid out of rent received from the land or from profits derived from private ownership.
('93', 395, 2, 7, 797700) What will happen to the above persons when land and capital are taken away from them?
('93', 395, 2, 8, 797786) Could not suffering be avoided and adequate provision made for the education of the young and the maintenance of the aged or infirm?
('93', 395, 2, 9, 797919) A. I admit I gave the advice and I still adhere to it.
('93', 395, 2, 10, 797974) I laid down a universal proposition for an ideal society.
('93', 395, 2, 11, 798032) In the present case it is a virtue of necessity for it is said that they cannot get labour which is principally Muslim.
('93', 395, 2, 12, 798152) The question about the education of the young and maintenance of the old and the infirm should not arise.
('93', 395, 2, 13, 798258) The young would get education at home and persons who work willingly will find that the old and infirm would be supported.
('93', 395, 2, 14, 798381) I am, however, free to confess that it is the business of the State to provide suitable education for the young and support for the aged and infirm.
('93', 395, 2, 15, 798530) It should also be remembered that I have not suggested that owners should give up their land free of price.
('93', 395, 2, 16, 798638) They would sell it on suitable terms or hold on to it and let it lie fallow.
('93', 395, 2, 17, 798715) It will not hurt.

('93', 396, 2, 5, 799632) There seems to be no doubt whatsoever that grants are due to these people; and yet through some bungling between the C. O. and the President of the Union Board, the thing is held up.
('93', 396, 2, 6, 799815) I do hope that you will act quickly, for in such cases quickness is the essence of the thing if a breakdown is to be avoided.

('93', 396, 4, 13, 800213) Even if it takes time, if you wrote just like on the first page, you would learn to write well.
('93', 396, 4, 14, 800309) It would save a lot of time and one would like to read merely for the handwriting.
('93', 396, 4, 15, 800392) It was for the sake of the handwriting that I read Jains interesting account.

('93', 396, 4, 19, 800646) It would be better that instead of Manu I think in the matter.
('93', 396, 4, 20, 800709) Right now I am shaping her and I shall continue to do so as long as she does what I say.

('93', 397, 2, 3, 801471) KAFILATALI, February 12, 1947
('93', 397, 3, 4, 801501) Gandhiji said that when he was studying in London over 45 years ago, he had read of the bravery of the Manipuris.
('93', 397, 3, 5, 801615) The members of the delegation 1, Gandhiji said, had complained to him that although caste Hindus in Assam considered the Manipuris part of themselves, yet they did not look after the interests of the Manipuris who had a separate language, a separate culture and a separate tradition of their own.
('93', 397, 3, 6, 801912) The caste Hindus, the delegation had complained, took advantage of the presence of the Manipuris in their midst only to swell their votes.
('93', 397, 3, 7, 802051) But none either understood or cared for the Manipuris interests.
('93', 397, 3, 8, 802116) Therefore, they thought, some arrangement should be made for safeguarding their interests.
('93', 397, 4, 9, 802207) Gandhiji said that all that he wanted to say on this was that if Hinduism was to survive, it would have to be casteless.
('93', 397, 4, 10, 802328) He had long since forgotten that he belonged to any caste.
('93', 397, 4, 11, 802387) Therefore, he delighted in calling himself a Bhangi and acting like one.
('93', 397, 4, 12, 802460) He did not believe in any artificial divisions.
('93', 397, 5, 13, 802508) If caste Hindus meant Brahmin, Kshatriya and Vaishya, these three were a hopeless minority which, when the British had wholly withdrawn and independence was truly established would, as the three superior castes, be wholly extinct.
('93', 397, 5, 14, 802739) Gandhiji hoped that all inequalities would be a thing of the past.
('93', 397, 5, 15, 802806) Then the so called downtrodden would come into their own.
('93', 397, 6, 16, 802864) Gandhiji said that, when untouchability was really gone, there would be no caste.
('93', 397, 6, 17, 802946) But while the caste system was in vogue, the untouchables would naturally want to belong to the higher castes.
('93', 397, 6, 18, 803057) But that was an impossibility.
('93', 397, 6, 19, 803088) Therefore any such attempt, according to Mahatma Gandhi, meant war among caste members on the one hand and the untouchables on the other.
('93', 397, 6, 20, 803226) But when castes disappeared, all would be Hindus pure and simple.
('93', 397, 6, 21, 803292) What he would say to the untouchables was that they should abolish all distinctions among themselves and observe the laws of cleanliness better than the so called caste Hindus.
('93', 397, 6, 22, 803469) And instead of working for separate treatment for themselves they should endeavour to merge themselves in the ocean of Hindu humanity.
('93', 397, 7, 23, 803604) Gandhiji, replying to a question, said he was emphatically of the opinion that the Hindus of Noakhali should not live in a special centre in Noakhali and erect factories where they could work.
('93', 397, 7, 24, 803797) Apart from his views on cottage industries, he could

('93', 398, 1, 3, 804145) That was the way to establish poisonous Pakistan all over India.
('93', 398, 2, 4, 804210) He could not approve of the idea anywhere in India.
('93', 398, 2, 5, 804262) That was the way to create wars among themselves.
('93', 398, 2, 6, 804312) It was not the way to independence.
('93', 398, 2, 7, 804348) He could not approve of separate quarters, for communities professing different religions.
('93', 398, 2, 8, 804439) Independent India, as conceived by me, will have all Indians belonging to different religions living in perfect friendship.
('93', 398, 2, 9, 804563) There need be no millionaires and no paupers; all would belong to the State, for the State belonged to them.

('93', 399, 6, 11, 806419) After congratulating the audience on the manner in which they had kept time during the Ramdhun, Gandhiji dealt with the two questions which had been put to him in course of the day.
('93', 399, 7, 12, 806601) Q. We agree that intrinsically a movement for reducing the share of the owner from half to a third of the crop is justified.
('93', 399, 7, 13, 806726) 5 But could not the present Tebhaga movement in Bengal be postponed until such time as when the affected persons can be smoothly absorbed in other occupations according to some long term plan sponsored by the State?
('93', 399, 7, 14, 806942) We know you have said that the only way to effect such a radical transformation in society is through non violence.
('93', 399, 7, 15, 807058) But interested parties will sleep over that portion of your advice and parade your moral support to their demand and carry on the movement in their own violent way.
('93', 399, 7, 16, 807223) Hence is it not wrong for you to lend support to the Movement under the present circumstances when there is every chance of the entire middle class of Bengal being completely ruined as a result?
('93', 399, 7, 17, 807418) The common villager will also suffer no less because he will also be deprived of the services now being rendered to the village economy by them.
('93', 399, 8, 18, 807563) A. In reply, Gandhiji uttered the warning that he only dealt with principles as he knew them.
('93', 399, 8, 19, 807657) He had not studied the local question.
('93', 399, 8, 20, 807696) Therefore, the questioner ran the risk of his ignorance causing injustice.
('93', 399, 9, 21, 807771) He felt that the question betrayed exaggeration on the part of the questioner.

('93', 400, 0, 1, 808034) VOL. 93: 7 NOVEMBER, 1946 16 FEBRUARY, 1947 401
('93', 400, 1, 2, 808082) There was no ruin impending for the landlord.
('93', 400, 1, 3, 808128) His land was not being confiscated.
('93', 400, 1, 4, 808164) His portion, which he could take even if he was in Timbuktu, was merely to be reduced from 50% to 33%.
('93', 400, 1, 5, 808267) He could see no ruin in the proposal.
('93', 400, 1, 6, 808305) He was afraid they were too much obsessed by the communal question.
('93', 400, 1, 7, 808373) They should rise above it and examine every problem strictly on merits.
('93', 400, 1, 8, 808445) Then they would never go wrong.
('93', 400, 1, 9, 808477) Therefore they should accept the moral principle underlying the demand for reduction of the owners share and work for solid amendments in which they were likely to succeed.
('93', 400, 1, 10, 808650) Let them not face confiscation rather than moderate reduction.
('93', 400, 1, 11, 808713) Let them remember that for years past India had lived through confiscation.
('93', 400, 1, 12, 808789) Industry after industry had been ruined and both the artisans as well as the farmers of India had been progressively reduced to poverty.
('93', 400, 2, 13, 808926) If the desired changes were brought about through non violent means, the world would not be deprived of the talents of the classes, but then the latter would not exercise them at the expense of the labourers.
('93', 400, 2, 14, 809135) In the non violent order of the future, the land would belong to the State, for had it not been said sabhi bhumi Gopalki 1?
('93', 400, 2, 15, 809259) Under such dispensation, there would be no waste of talents and labour.
('93', 400, 2, 16, 809331) This would be impossible through violent means.
('93', 400, 2, 17, 809379) It was therefore a truism to say that the utter ruin of the land owners brought about through violence would also involve the ruin of the labourers in the end.
('93', 400, 2, 18, 809539) If the land owners, therefore, acted wisely, no party would lose.
('93', 400, 3, 19, 809605) Q. Some women workers who earn part of their living by weaving mats were advised by you the other day to work on co operative principles.
('93', 400, 3, 20, 809743) Bengals agriculture has been reduced to an uneconomic proposition through extreme fragmentation of holdings.
('93', 400, 3, 21, 809852) Would you advise farmers also to adopt co operative methods?
('93', 400, 3, 22, 809913) If so, how are they to effect this under the present system of land ownership?
('93', 400, 3, 23, 809992) Should the State make the necessary changes in the law?
('93', 400, 3, 24, 810048) If the State is not ready, but the people so desire, how are they to work through their own organizations to this end?
('93', 400, 4, 25, 810167) A. Replying to the first part of the question, Gandhiji said that he had no doubt that the system of co operation was far more necessary for the agriculturists than for the mat weavers.
('93', 400, 4, 26, 810353) The land, as he maintained, belonged to the State; therefore, it yielded the largest return when it was worked co operatively.
('93', 400, 4, 27, 810480) Let it be remembered that co operation should be based on strict non violence.
('93', 400, 4, 28, 810559) There was no such thing as success of violent co operation.
('93', 400, 4, 29, 810619) Hitler was a forcible example of the latter.
('93', 400, 4, 30, 810664) He also talked vainly of co operation which was forced upon the people and everyone knew where Germany had been led as a result.
('93', 400, 5, 31, 810793) Gandhiji concluded by saying that it would be a sad thing if India also tried to build up the new society based on co operation by means of violence.
('93', 400, 5, 32, 810943) Good brought about through force destroyed individuality.
('93', 400, 5, 33, 811001) Only when the change was effected

('93', 402, 5, 8, 812661) WEST KEROA, February 14, 1947
('93', 402, 6, 9, 812691) Gandhiji read two passages from Abdullah Suhrawardys collections of the sayings of the Prophet.
('93', 402, 6, 10, 812787) Three Muslim friends of the place had come to him and asked him to pray that God might make both [Hindus and Muslims] live in peace and friendship.
('93', 402, 6, 11, 812935) When these friends came he was reading the sayings which he proposed to read to them.
('93', 402, 6, 12, 813021) They were as follows :
('93', 402, 7, 13, 813044) Be in the world like a traveller, or like a passer on, and reckon yourself as of the dead.
('93', 402, 8, 14, 813135) He considered it as a gem of gems.
('93', 402, 8, 15, 813170) They knew that death might overtake them any moment.
('93', 402, 8, 16, 813223) What a fine preparation for the event if all became as dead.
('93', 402, 8, 17, 813284) The very next question was who was the best man and who was the worst.
('93', 402, 8, 18, 813355) The Prophet considered him to be the best who lived long and performed good acts and him the worst who did bad acts.
('93', 402, 8, 19, 813472) It was a striking saying that man was to be judged by what he did, and not by what he said.
('93', 402, 9, 20, 813564) These sayings were for all men and women and not merely for those who called themselves Muslims.
('93', 402, 9, 21, 813661) Was the Hindu part of the audience doing good acts?
('93', 402, 9, 22, 813713) Was untouchability a good act?
('93', 402, 9, 23, 813744) He had shouted from the house tops that it was a blot on Hinduism.
('93', 402, 9, 24, 813811) So long as that blot remained, there was no peace and freedom for India.
('93', 402, 9, 25, 813884) The British would go but their freedom would not come without the complete removal of untouchability.

('93', 403, 3, 5, 814191) You have not asked for a reply but I am writing one because I find that you still remain too much concerned with small matters.
('93', 403, 3, 6, 814319) If the fact of Manu sleeping with me has not upset you and you have not lost faith in me, you should take my advice and merge yourself in Shriman.
('93', 403, 3, 7, 814466) I have observed that he is all adoration for you.
('93', 403, 3, 8, 814516) You also adore him, but you lack his wisdom.
('93', 403, 3, 9, 814561) I see nothing wrong in your telling Vasanti everything.
('93', 403, 3, 10, 814617) She is a wise woman, but I dont think she is capable of guiding you.
('93', 403, 3, 11, 814686) I have no doubt that your happiness lies in merging yourself in Shriman.
('93', 403, 3, 12, 814759) If you were a woman of spiritual knowledge, I would have advised you to oppose Shriman.
('93', 403, 3, 13, 814847) But you admit that you have no such knowledge.
('93', 403, 3, 14, 814894) If this advice appeals to you, act upon it whole heartedly.
('93', 403, 3, 15, 814954) If you have the slightest doubt, show this letter to Vinoba and abide by his advice.
('93', 403, 3, 16, 815039) Even otherwise you should show this letter to Vinoba.
('93', 403, 3, 17, 815093) Show it to Vasanti, too.
('93', 403, 3, 18, 815118) I understand about Ram 2s betrothal.
('93', 403, 3, 19, 815155) I did not take any interest in the affair.
('93', 403, 3, 20, 815198) May both be happy and, by dedicating themselves to selfless service, bring still greater lustre to Fathers name.
('93', 403, 3, 21, 815311) Convey this to Ram.

('93', 403, 8, 29, 815580) It needs more meticulousness.
('93', 403, 8, 30, 815610) As you become more meticulous, your handwriting will become as beautiful as pearls.
('93', 403, 8, 31, 815694) Then I shall not only read it myself, I shall also make Manu read it.
('93', 403, 8, 32, 815764) This time there are four pages.
('93', 403, 8, 33, 815796) My suggestion is that just two pages will be sufficient.

('93', 404, 1, 2, 816030) more at present because she has a heavy load of work and she does not wish to give up any of it.
('93', 404, 1, 3, 816127) So she has no time left.
('93', 404, 1, 4, 816152) I have not even asked her what she herself has in mind.
('93', 404, 1, 5, 816208) I am not asking her even while dictating this.
('93', 404, 1, 6, 816255) I am stealing even this little time.
('93', 404, 1, 7, 816292) I am quite fatigued mentally and physically.
('93', 404, 1, 8, 816337) The body wants to relax.
('93', 404, 1, 9, 816362) Not so the mind.
('93', 404, 1, 10, 816379) The mind is absorbed in Bengali.
('93', 404, 1, 11, 816412) But the memory having become blunted, the progress is slow.
('93', 404, 1, 12, 816472) Swamiji is not here.
('93', 404, 1, 13, 816493) As such, I am the only one left to teach Sanskrit.
('93', 404, 1, 14, 816544) And I cannot spare time.
('93', 404, 1, 15, 816569) One cannot say that even Swamiji was giving much time.
('93', 404, 1, 16, 816624) Manus development does not depend on learning all that.
('93', 404, 1, 17, 816680) It largely depends on me.
('93', 404, 1, 18, 816706) And so, it will depend on my efficiency and patience.
('93', 404, 1, 19, 816760) I have not even in my dream considered keeping Kishorelals letter, or any letter, secret from you.
('93', 404, 1, 20, 816859) But I do wish to spare you mental anguish.
('93', 404, 1, 21, 816902) But if you cannot check your curiosity it would be only proper that you should see it.
('93', 404, 1, 22, 816989) So I am sending you the letter.
('93', 404, 1, 23, 817021) Return it after reading.
('93', 404, 1, 24, 817046) From my point of view, it contains as much ignorance as love.
('93', 404, 1, 25, 817108) From his point of view, there is a whole group of people who believe that my practice is impelled by lust.
('93', 404, 1, 26, 817215) How can I say that the view of this group is altogether wrong ?
('93', 404, 1, 27, 817279) For, man does not know himself.
('93', 404, 1, 28, 817311) You will not find any open accusation made in these letters, though in Devdass letter it is openly made.
('93', 404, 1, 29, 817416) Whether or not I am free from physical desire will probably be known only after my death.
('93', 404, 1, 30, 817506) The term probably is deliberately used, because it does not always happen that we are able to correctly judge a man after his death.
('93', 404, 1, 31, 817639) Only God understands the heart of man.
('93', 404, 1, 32, 817678) When I cannot say with any certainty about myself that I do not feel the weight of whatever is happening, who can say that about Manu ?
('93', 404, 1, 33, 817814) She appears to be unconcerned, but she herself may not be fully aware of the turmoil in her mind.
('93', 404, 1, 34, 817912) I am not bothering her about it.
('93', 404, 1, 35, 817945) I am carrying on, leaving everything in the hands of God.
('93', 404, 1, 36, 818003) For me, all this is an inseparable part of the yajna and it remains to be seen how far my nonattachment can carry.
('93', 404, 1, 37, 818118) I have read both your papers.
('93', 404, 1, 38, 818148) I am sending them back, though you have said that it is not necessary to return the second paper.
('93', 404, 1, 39, 818246) Your reply to Satis Babu is correct.
('93', 404, 1, 40, 818283) The reply about Dr. Chandra Shekhar is also correct.
('93', 404, 1, 41, 818336) He must certainly be given medicines, etc.
('93', 404, 1, 42, 818379) If possible, persuade him to reduce the use of medicines.
('93', 404, 1, 43, 818437) More than medicines, what is needed is nursing and reassurance.

('93', 405, 2, 3, 818714) RAIPURA, February 15, 1947
('93', 405, 3, 4, 818741) GHANSHYAMDAS, I sent you a letter through Sushila.
('93', 405, 3, 5, 818792) But I have been upset somewhat by Sardars letter.
('93', 405, 3, 6, 818842) Devdass letter is still ringing in my ears.
('93', 405, 3, 7, 818886) I do not remember what I wrote to you, for I have not kept a copy of it.
('93', 405, 3, 8, 818959) All I wish today to write is that you should give up your attitude of neutrality.
('93', 405, 3, 9, 819041) Sardar is quite clear in his mind that what I look upon as my dharma is really adharma.
('93', 405, 3, 10, 819129) Devdas of course has written as much.
('93', 405, 3, 11, 819167) I have great faith in Sardars judgment.
('93', 405, 3, 12, 819207) I have faith in Devdass judgment too, but then, though grown up, in my eyes he is still a child.
('93', 405, 3, 13, 819304) This cannot be said of Sardar.
('93', 405, 3, 14, 819335) Kishorelal and Narahari too are grown ups; but it is not difficult for me to understand their opposition.
('93', 405, 3, 15, 819441) The link between you and me is your faith that my life is pure, spotless and wholly dedicated to the performance of dharma.
('93', 405, 3, 16, 819565) If that is not so, very little else remains.
('93', 405, 3, 17, 819610) I would, therefore, like you to take full part in this discussion, though not necessarily publiclyfor I certainly do not want your business to suffer.
('93', 405, 3, 18, 819761) But if I am conducting myself sinfully, it becomes the duty of all friends to oppose me vehemently.
('93', 405, 3, 19, 819861) A satyagrahi may end up as a duragrahi if he comes to regard untruth as truththat being the only distinction between the two.
('93', 405, 3, 20, 819987) I believe that is not the case with me; but that means little, for after all I am not God.
('93', 405, 3, 21, 820078) I can commit mistakes; I have committed mistakes; this may prove to be my biggest at the fag end of my life.
('93', 405, 3, 22, 820187) If that be so, all my well wishers can open my eyes if they oppose me.
('93', 405, 3, 23, 820258) If they do not I shall go from here even as I am.
('93', 405, 3, 24, 820308) Whatever I am doing here is as a part of my yajna.
('93', 405, 3, 25, 820359) There is nothing I do knowingly which is not a part and parcel of that yajna.
('93', 405, 3, 26, 820437) Even the rest I take is as a part of that yajna.
('93', 405, 3, 27, 820486) I am dictating this with a mud pack over my eyes and abdomen.
('93', 405, 3, 28, 820548) Shortly afterwards I shall be going to the evening prayer meeting.
('93', 405, 3, 29, 820615) This business about Manu is taking up a lot of my time, but I do not mind it because even her presence here is for the sake of that yajna.
('93', 405, 3, 30, 820754) Her test constitutes a part of that yajna.
('93', 405, 3, 31, 820797) I may not be able to explain it to youthat is a different matter.
('93', 405, 3, 32, 820863) The point I must make my friends grasp is this: When I take Manu in my lap, do I do so as a pure hearted father or as a father who has strayed from the path of virtue?
('93', 406, 0, 1, 821031) VOL. 93: 7 NOVEMBER, 1946 16 FEBRUARY, 1947 407
('93', 406, 1, 2, 821079) What I am doing is nothing new to me; in thought I have done it over the last 50 years; in action, in varying degrees, over quite a number of years.
('93', 406, 1, 3, 821228) Even if you sever all connection with me, I would not feel hurt.
('93', 406, 1, 4, 821293) Just as I want to stick to my dharma, you have to stick to yours.
('93', 406, 1, 5, 821359) To come to another matter, the Hindu weavers hereknown as tantisare very angry.
('93', 406, 1, 6, 821439) Their spinning wheels and houses have been for the most part burnt.
('93', 406, 1, 7, 821507) If they do not get a supply of yarn they have either to be idle or take to earth work as labourers.
('93', 406, 1, 8, 821607) The officer in charge here tells me that the Government cannot provide them yarn unless the Central Government helps.
('93', 406, 1, 9, 821725) I told him I might be able to obtain the needed supply if they were prepared to pay for it.
('93', 406, 1, 10, 821817) He has agreed.
('93', 406, 1, 11, 821832) Can you supply the yarn?
('93', 406, 1, 12, 821857) If yes, then how much, when and at what price?
('93', 406, 1, 13, 821904) Will it be necessary to obtain the sanction of the Interim Government?
('93', 406, 1, 14, 821975) Please let me know in detail.

('93', 406, 5, 20, 822228) And love is a thing of the heart.
('93', 406, 5, 21, 822262) There is no need to make a show of your sincere feeling.
('93', 406, 5, 22, 822319) And after all, what have I done?
('93', 406, 5, 23, 822352) Whatever good has come is entirely due to Gods grace.
('93', 406, 5, 24, 822406) Keep your love for me in your hearts and carry on.
('93', 406, 5, 25, 822457) If you have love for me do the work I have undertaken.

('93', 407, 2, 3, 822821) RAIPURA, February 15, 1947
('93', 407, 3, 4, 822848) The first question was: All over the district of Noakhali there is talk that the Muslim population should boycott the Hindus in every way.
('93', 407, 3, 5, 822987) Some Muslims who have worked for the Hindus recently or helped them during the riots report that they are under threat of boycott.
('93', 407, 3, 6, 823118) In this context what should be the duty of those Muslims who genuinely desire peace.
('93', 407, 4, 7, 823203) Gandhiji replied that he had heard of the boycott before.
('93', 407, 4, 8, 823261) But he entertained the hope that such was not the case on any extensive scale.
('93', 407, 4, 9, 823340) He had one case brought to his notice three or four days ago by a Muslim traveller from Gujarat who had come to see him.
('93', 407, 4, 10, 823461) He was rebuked for daring to want to see him.
('93', 407, 4, 11, 823507) The traveller stood his ground and came out of the ordeal safely.
('93', 407, 4, 12, 823573) Another poor Muslim who had come today was threatened with dire penalty if he dared to go to him.
('93', 407, 4, 13, 823671) He did not know what truth there was in the report.
('93', 407, 4, 14, 823723) The speaker then instanced printed leaflets that were pasted on the walls in the name of the Muslim pituni 2 Party.
('93', 407, 4, 15, 823839) These instances gave colour to the question.
('93', 407, 4, 16, 823884) He would say to the Muslim friends and others that these things should not frighten or disturb them.
('93', 407, 4, 17, 823985) They should ignore these things if they were isolated instances.
('93', 407, 4, 18, 824050) If they were on an extensive scale, probably the Government would deal with the situation.
('93', 407, 4, 19, 824141) If unfortunately boycott became the policy of the Government, it would be a serious matter.
('93', 407, 4, 20, 824233) He could only think non violently.
('93', 407, 4, 21, 824268) If they gave proper compensation he would probably advise acceptance.
('93', 407, 4, 22, 824338) He could not think out there and then the pros and cons.
('93', 407, 4, 23, 824395) If, on the other hand, they resorted to confiscation, he would advise people to stand their ground and refuse to leave their homesteads even on pain of death.
('93', 407, 4, 24, 824554) This he would say of all provinces whether Muslim majority or Hindu majority.
('93', 407, 4, 25, 824632) He however hoped that no Government would be mad enough to subscribe to the policy of boycott whether with or without compensation.
('93', 407, 4, 26, 824764) Those who belonged to the land for ages could not be removed from their homesteads merely for the reason that they found themselves in a minority.
('93', 407, 4, 27, 824911) That was no religion, Hindu, Muslim, Christian or any other.
('93', 407, 4, 28, 824972) It was intolerance.
('93', 407, 5, 29, 824992) The second question was: At East Keroa you advised 3 peasants to work co operatively in their fields.
('93', 407, 5, 30, 825094) Should they pool together their land and divide the crop in proportion to the area of the fields they held?
('93', 407, 5, 31, 825202) Would you give us an outline of the idea of how exactly they are to work in a co operative manner?
('93', 407, 6, 32, 825301) Gandhiji said that the question was good and admitted of a simple answer.

('93', 408, 1, 2, 825522) notion of co operation was that the land would be held in co operation by the owners and tilled and cultivated also in co operation.
('93', 408, 1, 3, 825655) This would cause a saving of labour, capital, tools, etc.
('93', 408, 1, 4, 825713) The owners would work in co operation and own capital, tools, animals and seeds etc., in co operation.
('93', 408, 1, 5, 825816) Co operative farming of his conception would change the face of the land and banish poverty and idleness from their midst.
('93', 408, 1, 6, 825939) All this was only possible if people became friends of one another and as one family.
('93', 408, 1, 7, 826025) When that happy event took place, there would be no ugly sore in the form of communal problem.

('93', 408, 4, 11, 826197) Gandhiji referred to the two visits 2 and expressed his gratefulness for being able to pay them.
('93', 408, 4, 12, 826294) He then referred briefly to the speech reported to have been made by the ex Premier Maulvi Fazlul Huq.
('93', 408, 4, 13, 826397) He was reported to have said that as a non Muslim Gandhi should not preach the teachings of Islam, that instead of Hindu Muslim unity he was creating bitterness between the two communities and that had he (Gandhiji) gone to Barisal 3 he would have driven him into the canal.
('93', 408, 4, 14, 826672) He also wondered how the Muslims of Noakhali and Tippera could tolerate Gandhis presence so long.
('93', 408, 5, 15, 826770) Gandhiji said that he had grave doubts about the accuracy of the report.
('93', 408, 5, 16, 826843) If it was the correct summary of the speech, he would consider it to be most unfortunate coming from a man holding the responsible position that the Maulvi Saheb held and aspiring to be the President of the Muslim League.
('93', 408, 5, 17, 827065) He was not aware of having done anything to create bitterness between the two communities.
('93', 408, 5, 18, 827156) The speaker had never claimed to preach Islam.
('93', 408, 5, 19, 827203) What he had undoubtedly done was to interpret the teachings of the Prophet and refer to them in his own speeches.
('93', 408, 5, 20, 827317) His interpretation was submitted for acceptance or rejection.
('93', 408, 6, 21, 827379) In the same speech Fazlul Huq had said that when Gandhiji returned from South Africa he had asked him (Gandhiji) to embrace Islam, whereupon Gandhiji had said that he was a Muslim in the true sense of the term.
('93', 408, 6, 22, 827590) Mr. Huq had requested him to proclaim it publicly, but Gandhiji refused to do so.
('93', 408, 6, 23, 827672) He said that he had no recollection whatsoever of the conversation and he was never in the habit of suppressing from the public what he had said privately.
('93', 408, 6, 24, 827828) The audience, however, knew that he had stated in
('93', 408, 7, 25, 827878) 1 Extracted from Gandhijis Walking Tour Diary 2 Gandhiji had attended a community dinner and had visited a mosque in Raipura.

('93', 409, 1, 3, 828244) That such a claim would be rejected and on some occasions was rejected, he knew.
('93', 409, 1, 4, 828325) That, however, did not affect his fundamental position and if he had said what was attributed to him by Fazlul Huq, Gandhiji would gladly declare his repentance if he would believe what was represented to him.
('93', 409, 1, 5, 828535) Indeed he had put forth the claim in South Africa to be a good Mussalman simultaneously with being a good member of the other religions of the world.
('93', 409, 1, 6, 828685) He would repeat for the sake of the ex Premier of Bengal that he was misreported and he would welcome the correct version from him.

('93', 410, 4, 5, 828978) November 21, 1946
('93', 410, 5, 6, 828996) Your proposal that these demands should be satisfied before the Peace Committees can be formed, virtually means a summary rejection of the peace offer.
('93', 410, 5, 7, 829148) This will only succeed in embittering feelings still further.
('93', 410, 5, 8, 829210) The Government offer should be accepted on grounds of expediency.
('93', 410, 5, 9, 829276) I do not however plead for peace at any price, certainly not at the price of honour.
('93', 410, 5, 10, 829361) Let us act on the square, and let us put them in the wrong.
('93', 410, 5, 11, 829421) It was exactly in this way that Indians were able to gain the silent sympathy of a large number of Europeans in South Africa.
('93', 410, 5, 12, 829547) If, after a fair trial, the Committees are found unworkable, you can come out with your honour intact.
('93', 410, 5, 13, 829650) That sense of honour will give you a courage which no man can beat.
('93', 410, 6, 14, 829718) If I succeed cent per cent in my own plan, then conditions will improve.
('93', 410, 6, 15, 829791) But of this, there does not seem to be any prospect at the present moment.
('93', 410, 6, 16, 829866) Yet, as a man of hope, I continue to hope against hope.
('93', 410, 6, 17, 829922) In the present case, I confess through bitter experience that there is no sign of change of heart, but certainly there has been a change of plan.
('93', 410, 6, 18, 830068) Considerations of expediency demand that the proposal should therefore be accepted.
('93', 410, 7, 19, 830152) He also added that hitherto our non violence had been non violence of the
('93', 410, 8, 20, 830226) weak; but now that we had to apply it against a section of our own countrymen instead
('93', 410, 9, 21, 830312) of against the British, it had to be non violence of the strong.
('93', 410, 10, 22, 830377) The demands were now examined one by one.
('93', 410, 10, 23, 830419) In place of the demand that
('93', 410, 11, 24, 830447) certain Muslim officers should be replaced by Hindu officers, Gandhiji remarked that
('93', 410, 12, 25, 830532) it was unreasonable and a communal demand.
('93', 410, 13, 26, 830575) While putting forward such a proposal, you should ask yourself if the Muslims
('93', 410, 14, 27, 830653) of Bihar can reasonably make a similar demand.
('93', 410, 14, 28, 830700) In my opinion, the present demand is
('93', 410, 15, 29, 830737) absurd and I would personally never countenance it.
('93', 410, 15, 30, 830789) You can, of course, substitute in
('93', 410, 16, 31, 830823) its place, impartial officers in place of biased ones; that would be fair.
('93', 410, 17, 32, 830898) Then there was a demand for the removal of the Superintendent of Police.
('93', 410, 18, 33, 830971) Gandhiji was against it also.
('93', 410, 18, 34, 831001) In his opinion, the guilt lay elsewhere.
('93', 410, 18, 35, 831042) The Chief
('93', 410, 19, 36, 831052) Ministers wishes might have been carried out by this officer, for he could not

('93', 411, 1, 2, 831219) obviously act on his own initiative.
('93', 411, 1, 3, 831256) Someone remarked that Abdullah Saheb was a
('93', 411, 2, 4, 831299) man without conscience.
('93', 411, 2, 5, 831323) Gandhiji immediately replied :
('93', 411, 3, 6, 831354) I have yet to see a Police Superintendent who has a conscience.
('93', 411, 4, 7, 831418) Mr. Suhrawardy was perhaps the fulcrum.
('93', 411, 4, 8, 831458) He wanted to show the whole world what he
('93', 411, 5, 9, 831500) was capable of doing.
('93', 411, 5, 10, 831522) But he over reached himself.
('93', 411, 6, 11, 831551) Someone then pointed out to Gandhiji that the Ministry in Bihar had
('93', 411, 7, 12, 831619) employed Muslim armed soldiers to quell the disturbances, the suggestion being that
('93', 411, 8, 13, 831703) this was for the appeasement of the Muslims.
('93', 411, 8, 14, 831748) Gandhiji was clearly of opinion that
('93', 411, 9, 15, 831785) such a thing, if true, was surely a sign of weakness.
('93', 411, 10, 16, 831839) The last point raised was in connection with the Hindu members of the Peace
('93', 411, 11, 17, 831915) Committees.
('93', 411, 11, 18, 831927) Manoranjan Chaudhuri pleaded for postponement, as most of the
('93', 411, 12, 19, 831989) leading Hindus had left the district and only poor weavers, blacksmiths or farmers
('93', 411, 13, 20, 832072) remained behind.
('93', 411, 13, 21, 832089) If these were to be on the Committees, they would be no match for
('93', 411, 14, 22, 832155) the more intelligent and educated Mussalman representatives.
('93', 411, 14, 23, 832216) Gandhiji said with
('93', 411, 15, 24, 832235) some warmth that if many had fled, leaving neighbours to their own fate, they did not
('93', 411, 16, 25, 832321) deserve to be called leaders.
('93', 411, 16, 26, 832351) The seats would have to be occupied by barbers,
('93', 411, 17, 27, 832399) washermen and the like, who were as much interested in the preservation of their life
('93', 411, 18, 28, 832485) and property as the rich.
('93', 411, 18, 29, 832511) It was not unlikely that they might submit to the influence
('93', 411, 19, 30, 832571) of Muslim members.
('93', 411, 19, 31, 832590) But the risk had to be run if true democracy was to be evolved.
('93', 411, 20, 32, 832654) Gandhiji then referred to the history of democracy in England, and expressed his
('93', 411, 21, 33, 832735) admiration for the manner in which the common people of England had fought every
('93', 411, 22, 34, 832816) inch of the ground for the preservation of their rights; and in this connection he
('93', 411, 23, 35, 832899) mentioned the name of Wat Tyler.

('93', 412, 1, 2, 833469) operation of all parties in the Constituent Assembly.
('93', 412, 1, 3, 833523) It is not expected that any final
('93', 412, 2, 4, 833557) settlement could be arrived at since the Indian representatives must consult their
('93', 412, 3, 5, 833640) colleagues before any final decision is reached.
('93', 412, 4, 6, 833689) The main difficulty that has arisen has been over the interpretation of paragraph 19(v) and (viii) of the Cabinet Missions Statement 1 of May 16, relating to the Meetings in Sections which run as follows :
('93', 412, 5, 7, 833895) Paragraph 19(v) : These Sections shall proceed to settle provincial constitutions for the Provinces included in each Section and shall also decide whether any Group constitution shall be set up for those Provinces and if so, with what provincial subjects the Group should deal.
('93', 412, 5, 8, 834173) Provinces should have power to opt out of Groups in accordance with the provisions of sub clause (viii) below :
('93', 412, 6, 9, 834285) Paragraph 19(viii) : As soon as the new constitutional arrangements have come into operation, it shall be open to any Province to elect to come out of any Group in which it has been placed.
('93', 412, 6, 10, 834475) Such a decision shall be taken by the Legislature of the Province after the first General Election under the new Constitution.
('93', 412, 7, 11, 834602) The Cabinet Mission have throughout maintained the view that the decisions of the Sections should, in the absence of agreement to the contrary, be taken by simple majority vote of the representatives in the Sections.
('93', 412, 7, 12, 834819) This view has been accepted by the Muslim League, but the Congress have put forward a different view.
('93', 412, 7, 13, 834921) They have asserted that the true meaning of the Statement, read as a whole, is that the Provinces have a right to decide both as to Grouping and as to their own constitutions.
('93', 412, 8, 14, 835097) His Majestys Government have had legal advice which confirms that the Statement of May 16 means what the Cabinet Mission have always stated was their intention.
('93', 412, 8, 15, 835258) This part of the Statement, as so interpreted, must, therefore, be considered an essential part of the scheme of May 16, for enabling the Indian people to formulate a constitution which His Majestys Government would be prepared to submit to Parliament.
('93', 412, 8, 16, 835511) It should, therefore, be accepted by all parties in the Constituent Assembly.
('93', 412, 9, 17, 835589) It is however, clear that other questions of interpretation of the Statement of May 16 may arise, and His Majestys Government hope that if the Council of the Muslim League are able to agree to participate in the Constituent Assembly, they will also agree, as have the Congress, that the Federal Court should be asked to decide matters of interpretation that may be referred to them by either side and will accept such a decision, so that the procedure both in the Union Constituent Assembly and in

('93', 413, 1, 2, 836191) the Sections may accord with the Cabinet Missions Plan.
('93', 413, 2, 3, 836247) On the matter immediately in dispute, His Majestys Government urge the Congress to accept the view of the Cabinet Mission in order that the way may be opened for the Muslim League to reconsider their attitude.
('93', 413, 2, 4, 836457) If, in spite of this reaffirmation of the intention of the Cabinet Mission, the Constituent Assembly desires that this fundamental point should be referred for the decision of the Federal Court, such reference should be made at a very early date.
('93', 413, 2, 5, 836704) It will then be reasonable that the meetings of the Sections of the Constituent Assembly should be postponed until the decision of the Federal Court is known.
('93', 413, 3, 6, 836863) There has never been any prospect of success for the Constituent Assembly, except upon the basis of agreed procedure.
('93', 413, 3, 7, 836981) Should a constitution come to be framed by a Constituent Assembly in which a large section of the Indian population had not been represented, His Majestys Government could not, of course, contemplateas the Congress have stated they would not contemplateforcing such a constitution upon any unwilling parts of the country.

('93', 414, 10, 11, 839633) Thursday, December 19, 1946 In the morning, while I was administering his daily bath, Gandhiji spoke to me of his own accord about the happenings of the 17th.
('93', 414, 10, 12, 839792) Ever since that day, no word had passed on this subject between him and me.
('93', 414, 10, 13, 839868) He wished to learn from me as well as from Parasuram if Sushila Nayyar had fallen in our estimation (Tumhari nazar me gir gai hai?) on account of that days incident.
('93', 414, 10, 14, 840034) I said I could speak for myself, not for Parasuram.
('93', 414, 10, 15, 840086) She had undoubtedly fallen, and the reason was this.
('93', 414, 10, 16, 840139) No person however great had the right to disturb him as Sushila had apparently done.
('93', 414, 10, 17, 840224) Gandhiji then said, Supposing she did so with a good intention, perhaps to help me in my own work?
('93', 414, 10, 18, 840323) She may have been suggesting certain steps even for my sake, not for her own; even then, would you say she was wrong? I said, Yes, even then.
('93', 414, 10, 19, 840465) If she felt that you were contemplating a wrong step, she might have offered her suggestions and then left you free to decide. Gandhiji said, She is against my plan of tour on foot in the present condition of my health.
('93', 414, 10, 20, 840685) she thinks that at least one old companion who knows all about my personal needs should accompany me, and she offered her own services.

('93', 415, 1, 2, 840953) suggested that it would not be safe to depend on new workers like you and Parasuram, who know so little about my physical requirements. I said, If I had been in her position, I would have placed my views fully before you and left you free to decide.
('93', 415, 1, 3, 841203) If the decision had not been favourable, I would have waited patiently until you discovered your error. After I spoke, Gandhiji repeated the substance of my views in his own language in order to make sure that he had understood me rightly.

('93', 415, 7, 10, 841563) At night while reading Bapus diary I read I had a curious dream.
('93', 415, 7, 11, 841628) I casually asked him what it was.
('93', 415, 7, 12, 841662) He did not say and I kept quiet.
('93', 415, 8, 13, 841695) At three oclock the next morning, I woke up with the noise of Bapu jumping
('93', 415, 9, 14, 841770) in bed.
('93', 415, 9, 15, 841778) He said he was very cold and was taking exercise to warm up.
('93', 415, 9, 16, 841839) After that, he
('93', 415, 10, 17, 841854) asked me if I was awake and started telling me of his curious dream.
('93', 415, 10, 18, 841923) After the dream he
('93', 415, 11, 19, 841942) started explaining how his present step was a tapascharya (penance) for him, and how
('93', 415, 12, 20, 842027) he was going through inconveniences.
('93', 415, 12, 21, 842064) On the previous day, I had remarked that God
('93', 415, 13, 22, 842109) did and would send him helpers in whatever he did.
('93', 415, 13, 23, 842160) In a short note I asked him if I
('93', 415, 14, 24, 842193) would be allowed to come with him.
('93', 415, 14, 25, 842228) I mentioned that what he had said about
('93', 415, 15, 26, 842268) tapascharya and what I had said about God sending him help were not contradictory
('93', 415, 16, 27, 842350) and tried to explain it.
('93', 415, 16, 28, 842375) He answered with irritation that he had tried to explain things
('93', 415, 17, 29, 842439) to me but had not succeeded.
('93', 415, 17, 30, 842468) I could see that he was getting worked up.
('93', 415, 18, 31, 842511) walked away.
('93', 415, 18, 32, 842524) Suddenly I heard him slap his forehead.
('93', 415, 18, 33, 842564) I rushed back and stopped

('93', 415, 20, 35, 842617) I came yesterday with great trepidation.
('93', 415, 21, 36, 842658) had asked me to come for Gita.
('93', 415, 21, 37, 842689) He again raised the topic this morning and I found
('93', 415, 22, 38, 842740) that my self control has not returned as yet.

('93', 416, 2, 3, 842980) December 22, 1946
('93', 416, 3, 4, 842998) The Working Committee have given careful consideration to the state ment issued by the British Government on December 6, 1946, as well as other statements made recently on their behalf in Parliament.
('93', 416, 3, 5, 843198) These statements, though made by way of interpretation and elucidation, are clearly additions to and variations of the British Cabinet Missions Statement of May 16, 1946, on which the whole scheme of the Constituent Assembly was based.
('93', 416, 4, 6, 843434) 2. The Statement of May 16, 1946, laid down in paragraph 15(iii) as basic principles of the constitution all subjects other than Union subjects and all residuary powers should vest in the Provinces, and that Provinces should be free to form Groups with executives and legislatures.
('93', 416, 4, 7, 843716) The Provinces were thus intended to be autonomous, subject to the Union controlling certain specified subjects.
('93', 416, 4, 8, 843828) Paragraph 19 laid down, inter alia, the procedure for Sections to meet, for decisions to be taken as to whether Groups should be formed or not, and for any province to elect to come out of the Group in which it might have been placed.
('93', 416, 5, 9, 844063) 3. In their resolution of May 24, 1946, the Working Committee pointed out what appeared to be a divergence between the basic principles and the procedure suggested, in that a measure of compulsion was introduced which infringed the basic principle of provincial autonomy.
('93', 416, 5, 10, 844335) The Cabinet Mission, thereupon issued a Statement on May 25, 1946, in which it was stated that the interpretation put by the Congress resolution on paragraph 15 of the Statement, to the effect that the provinces can in the first instance make the choice whether or not to belong to the Section in which they are placed does not accord with the Delegations intentions.
('93', 416, 5, 11, 844703) The reasons for grouping of the provinces are well known and this is an essential feature of the scheme and can only be modified by agreements between the two parties.
('93', 416, 6, 12, 844871) 4. The Congress made it clear later that their objection was not to provinces entering Sections but to compulsory grouping and the possibility of a dominating province framing a constitution for another province entirely against the wishes of the latter.
('93', 416, 6, 13, 845126) This might result in the framing of rules, franchise, constituencies etc., for elections and otherwise which might seriously prejudice or even nullify the provision for a province subsequently to opt out of a Group.
('93', 416, 6, 14, 845342) We pointed out that this could never be the intention of the Cabinet Mission as it would be repugnant to the basic

('93', 417, 1, 3, 845599) Our own approach to the problem of constitution making has all along been that coercion should not be exercised and that the constitution of free India should be drawn up by the co operation and goodwill of all parties concerned.
('93', 417, 2, 4, 845829) 5. In a letter dated 13th June, 1946, from Lord Wavell to Maulana Azad, the President of the Congress, it was stated that The Delegation and I are aware of your objections to the principle of grouping.
('93', 417, 2, 5, 846031) I would, however, point out that the Statement of 16th May does not make grouping compulsory.
('93', 417, 2, 6, 846125) It leaves the decision to the elected representatives of the provinces concerned sitting together in Sections.
('93', 417, 2, 7, 846236) The only provision which is made is that the representatives of certain provinces should meet in Sections so that they can decide whether or not they wish to form Groups.
('93', 417, 2, 8, 846407) Thus the principle which was emphasized again was that grouping was not compulsory and in regard to Sections a certain procedure was indicated.
('93', 417, 2, 9, 846551) This procedure was not clear and could be interpreted in more than one way and in any event a point of procedure could not override a basic principle.
('93', 417, 2, 10, 846702) We pointed out that the right interpretation should be one which did no violence to that principle.
('93', 417, 2, 11, 846802) Further, in order to smooth the way to the co operation of all concerned in the working of the proposed scheme we suggested that if our interpretation was not accepted, we would be agreeable to a reference on this point to the Federal Court.
('93', 417, 3, 12, 847044) 6. It is well known that the proposal in regard to grouping affected injuriously two provinces especially, namely, Assam and the North West Frontier Province, as well as the Sikhs in the Punjab.
('93', 417, 3, 13, 847239) Their representatives expressed their strong disapproval of this proposal.
('93', 417, 3, 14, 847314) In a letter from Master Tara Singh to the Secretary of State dated 25th May, 1946, he gave expression to the anxiety and apprehensions of the Sikhs and asked for clarification in regard to certain matters.
('93', 417, 3, 15, 847520) The Secretary of State sent an answer to this letter on 1st June, 1946, in the course of which he said, I have considered carefully the detailed points you raise at the end of your letter.
('93', 417, 3, 16, 847709) I fear the Mission cannot issue any additions to, or interpretation of, the Statement.
('93', 417, 4, 17, 847796) 7. In spite of this explicit statement, the British Government have, on December 6th, issued a statement which is both an addition to, and an interpretation of, the Statement of May 16, 1946. They have done so after more than six and a half months, during which period many developments have taken place as a consequence of the original Statement.
('93', 417, 4, 18, 848144) Throughout this period the position of the Congress was made repeatedly clear to the British Government or their representatives, and it was with full knowledge of this position that the British Government acted.
('93', 417, 4, 19, 848357) That position was in conformity with the basic principles laid down in the Statement of May 16, 1946, which Statement the Congress had accepted in its entirety.
('93', 417, 4, 20, 848518) Further, the Congress had expressed its willingness to refer, if necessity arose, the point of
('93', 418, 0, 1, 848613) VOL. 93: 7 NOVEMBER, 1946 16 FEBRUARY, 1947 419
('93', 418, 1, 2, 848661) interpretation to the Federal Court, whose decision should be accepted by the parties concerned.
('93', 418, 2, 3, 848758) 8. When the invitation of the British Government was received by the Congress at the end of November last to send its representatives to London, the Congress position was clearly indicated again.
('93', 418, 2, 4, 848954) It was on certain assurances of the Prime Minister of Great Britain that a representative of the Congress proceeded to London.
('93', 418, 3, 5, 849081) 9. In spite of this assurance and of previous assurances to the effect that no additions to, or interpretations of, the Statement of May 16, 1946, were going to be made, the British Government have now issued a statement which clearly, in many respects, goes beyond the original Statement, on the basis of which progress has been made till now.
('93', 418, 4, 6, 849426) 10. The Working Committee deeply regret that the British Government should have acted in a manner which has not been in keeping with their own assurances, and which has created suspicion in the minds of large numbers of people in India.
('93', 418, 4, 7, 849663) For some time past the attitude of the British Government and their representative in India has been such as to add to the difficulties and complexities of the situation in the country.
('93', 418, 4, 8, 849849) Their present intervention, on the eve of the meeting of the Constituent Assembly, and the manner and tone in which this has taken place, has lessened the chances of a peaceful and co operative transfer of power in India, for which the Congress has been working.
('93', 418, 4, 9, 850112) This has created a new situation which is full of peril for the future, and because of this, the Working Committee have been anxious and given prolonged thought to it.
('93', 418, 4, 10, 850280) Many of the speeches made recently in the British Parliament, which abound in wrong statements and inferences, are in tone and content representative of the authoritarian and aggressive traditions of British Imperialism.
('93', 418, 4, 11, 850501) The India of today cannot tolerate this approach from any outsider and resents alien interference and intervention.
('93', 418, 5, 12, 850617) 11. The Congress, however, cannot be diverted from its path by provocative utterances and external intervention.
('93', 418, 5, 13, 850730) It seeks to frame, through the Constituent Assembly, a constitution of a free and independent India with the willing co operation of all elements of the Indian people.
('93', 418, 5, 14, 850898) The Working Committee regret that the Muslim League members of the constituent Assembly have refrained from attending its opening session.
('93', 418, 5, 15, 851037) The Committee, however, appreciate and express their gratification at the presence in the Constituent Assembly of representatives of all other interests and sections of the people of India, and note with pleasure the spirit of co operation in a common task and a high endeavour which has been in evidence during the sessions of the Assembly.
('93', 418, 5, 16, 851379) The Committee will continue their efforts to make the Constituent Assembly fully representative of all the people of India and trust that members of the Muslim League will give their co operation in this great
('93', 419, 0, 1, 851589) 420 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('93', 419, 1, 2, 851631) In order to achieve this, the Committee have advised Congress representatives in the Assembly to postpone consideration of controversial issues to a subsequent meeting.
('93', 419, 2, 3, 851800) 12. In their Statement of December 6, 1946, the British Government in giving their interpretation of a doubtful point of procedure have referred to it as a fundamental point, and suggested that the Constituent Assembly may refer it to the Federal Court.
('93', 419, 2, 4, 852054) Subsequent statements made on behalf of the British Government have made it clear that they are not prepared to accept the decision of this court should it go against their own interpretation.
('93', 419, 2, 5, 852247) On behalf of the Muslim League also it has been stated that they will not be bound by the decision of the Federal Court.
('93', 419, 2, 6, 852368) While the Congress has always been willing to abide by such a reference and decision in regard to this matter, any reference now, when none of the other parties are prepared to join in it or to accept it, becomes totally uncalled for and unbecoming, and unsuited to the dignity of either the Congress or the Federal Court.
('93', 419, 2, 7, 852691) By their repeated statements, British Statesmen have ruled this out.
('93', 419, 3, 8, 852760) 13. The Working Committee are still of opinion that the interpretation put by the British Government in regard to the method of voting in the Sections is not in conformity with provincial autonomy, which is one of the fundamental bases of the proposed constitution.
('93', 419, 3, 9, 853026) Nevertheless, the Committee are anxious to avoid anything that may come in the way of the successful working of the Constituent Assembly.
('93', 419, 3, 10, 853164) To ensure this they will endeavour to seek and obtain the largest measure of co operation, provided that no fundamental principle is violated.
('93', 419, 3, 11, 853307) They are, therefore, advising Congress representatives in the Constituent Assembly to accept the procedure suggested.
('93', 419, 3, 12, 853425) But they cannot be parties to any coercion of a province against its will or to the interests of the Sikhs being made to suffer by a majority in a Section.
('93', 419, 3, 13, 853581) In particular, any attempt to impose the basic structure of a provincial constitution, such as franchise, constituencies etc., against the wishes of the majority of representatives from the province concerned will have to be resisted.
('93', 419, 3, 14, 853816) Such an imposition would render nugatory the right to opt out which has been given to a Province.
('93', 419, 4, 15, 853914) 14. The Working Committee earnestly hope that their efforts to gain the co operation in the Constituent Assembly of those who have so far denied it will meet with response and success, so that the great work that has now begun may proceed rapidly and end in the framing of a constitution which does justice and gives freedom and opportunity to every man and woman in India.
('93', 419, 4, 16, 854288) In any event the Constituent Assembly must go on till it has accomplished its task and a free, democratic, and sovereign republic emerges from its labours.

('93', 420, 2, 3, 854588) A. I. C. C. RESOLUTION 1
('93', 420, 3, 4, 854613) The A. I. C. C. having considered the events that have taken place in the
('93', 420, 4, 5, 854687) country since the Meerut Session of the Congress in November last, the statement
('93', 420, 5, 6, 854768) issued by the British Government on December 6, 1946, and the statement of the
('93', 420, 6, 7, 854847) Working Committee of December 22, 1946, advises Congressmen as follows :
('93', 420, 7, 8, 854920) The A. I. C. C. endorses the statement of the Working Committee of December
('93', 420, 8, 9, 854996) 22, 1946, and expresses its agreement with the views contained therein.
('93', 420, 9, 10, 855068) While the Congress has always been agreeable to making a reference to the Federal Court on the question of interpretation in dispute, such a reference has become purposeless and undesirable owing to recent announcements made on behalf of the British Government.
('93', 420, 9, 11, 855330) A reference could only be made on an agreed basis, the parties concerned agreeing to abide by the decision given.
('93', 420, 10, 12, 855444) The A. I. C. C. is firmly of opinion that the constitution for a free and independent India should be framed by the people of India on the basis of as wide an agreement as possible.
('93', 420, 10, 13, 855626) There must be no interference whatsoever by any external authority, and no compulsion of any province or part of a province by another province.
('93', 420, 10, 14, 855771) The A. I. C. C. realizes and appreciates the difficulties placed in the way of some provinces, notably Assam, the N. W. F. P. and Baluchistan and the Sikhs in the Punjab, by the British Cabinets scheme of May 16, 1946, and more especially by the interpretation put upon it by the British Government in their statement of December 6, 1946. The Congress cannot be a party to any such compulsion or imposition against the will of the people concerned., a principle which the British Government have themselves recognized.
('93', 420, 11, 15, 856290) The A. I. C. C. is anxious that the Constituent Assembly should proceed with the work of framing a constitution for free India with the goodwill of all parties concerned, and, with a view to removing the difficulties that have arisen owing to varying interpretations, agrees to advise action in accordance with the interpretation of the British Government in regard to the procedure to be followed in the Sections.
('93', 420, 11, 16, 856705) It must be clearly understood, however, that this must not involve any compulsion of a province and that the rights of the Sikhs in the Punjab should not be jeopardized.

('93', 421, 1, 2, 857328) the event of any attempt at such compulsion, a province or part of a province has the right to take such action as may be deemed necessary in order to give effect to the wishes of the people concerned.
('93', 421, 1, 3, 857530) The future course of action will depend upon the developments that take place and the A.I.C.C., therefore, directs the Working Committee to advise upon it, whenever circumstances so require, keeping in view the basic principle of provincial autonomy.

('93', 421, 4, 6, 857841) LETTER FROM SATIS CHANDRA MUKERJEE 1
('93', 421, 5, 7, 857878) January 14, 1947
('93', 421, 6, 8, 857895) Longevity can be prolonged indefinitely if only the utterance of Ramanama
('93', 421, 7, 9, 857969) (the lords name) becomes with the sadhaka, not an act of conscious will or choice,
('93', 421, 8, 10, 858052) but gets to be an automatic, inward process, springing from within and expressing
('93', 421, 9, 11, 858134) itself outwardly, consciously or sub consciously.
('93', 421, 9, 12, 858184) This, in my view, is only possible
('93', 421, 10, 13, 858219) when the utterance of the Lords name gets tacked on to, or better, becomes a part of
('93', 421, 11, 14, 858304) the sadhakas breathing movement.
('93', 421, 12, 15, 858337) Therefore my second point is that the Lords name or Ramanama is no more an
('93', 421, 13, 16, 858412) outer sound emitted by the sadhaka, but is verily a form of spiritual or Divine Energy.
('93', 421, 14, 17, 858500) My third point is that when the utterance of Ramanama gets to be intimately
('93', 421, 15, 18, 858576) associated with the breathing movement of the sadhaka, it is bound to react on the
('93', 421, 16, 19, 858659) whole of the sadhakas external system, including the mental apparatus, scripturally
('93', 421, 17, 20, 858743) known as the Lingasharira or the sukshma sharira.
('93', 421, 18, 21, 858793) My fourth point is that when the Spiritual or Chit Energy of the Divine so
('93', 421, 19, 22, 858868) reacts, then the whole apparatus sthula and sukshma, gets to be impregnated with the
('93', 421, 20, 23, 858953) Spiritual or Chit Energy derived from, or inhering in, Ramanama.
('93', 421, 20, 24, 859018) Therefore when that
('93', 421, 21, 25, 859038) happens, what is to us at present material (whether of grosser or the finer variety),
('93', 421, 22, 26, 859124) becomes so energised by the Spiritual or Chit Energy (which is the essence of
('93', 421, 23, 27, 859202) Ramanama), that the laws of matter manifesting themselves in material disinte 
('93', 421, 24, 28, 859281) the initial stages.
('93', 421, 24, 29, 859301) Those who participate in the Constituent Assembly or the Sections will proceed to frame a constitution in terms of the Cabinet Missions Statement, which constitution will be initially binding on them alone.
('93', 421, 24, 30, 859508) 6. The constitution must be framed for the whole of India with specific provision laying down how those who have not participated in its making may avail themselves of it.

('93', 422, 1, 2, 859829) gration and decay become, for the time being, suspended so to say.
('93', 422, 1, 3, 859896) As the result of
('93', 422, 2, 4, 859913) such suspension, the sadhaka could go on existing on the objective plane (as an
('93', 422, 3, 5, 859993) objective entity), immune from the operation of the force which tends towards
('93', 422, 4, 6, 860071) disintegration and decay.
('93', 422, 5, 7, 860097) Lastly and fifthly, at this stage equanimity, a term which you have used,
('93', 422, 6, 8, 860171) cannot be termed mental, that is, born of the control of the mind stuff.
('93', 422, 6, 9, 860244) Then it
('93', 422, 7, 10, 860252) comes to be a function of the sadhakas soul life, and may therefore be called soul 
('93', 422, 8, 11, 860336) At this stage the equanimity in question comes to be natural, deep, and
('93', 422, 9, 12, 860408) spontaneous.
('93', 422, 10, 13, 860421) The above point may be made clearer by saying that the type of equanimity
('93', 422, 11, 14, 860495) which comes to be born of the process of utterance of Ramanama along with every
('93', 422, 12, 15, 860575) exhalation and inhalation of the sadhakas breath, far transcends in its very nature
('93', 422, 13, 16, 860659) the kind of equanimity of which we cannot at present conceive.
('93', 422, 13, 17, 860722) the reason for it, as
('93', 422, 14, 18, 860744) already pointed out, is that the type of equanimity in question is no longer mindborn,
('93', 422, 15, 19, 860831) but is essentially an apparatus of soul life or spirituality.
('93', 422, 15, 20, 860893) This higher type of
('93', 422, 16, 21, 860913) equanimity is scripturally termed as shanti.
('93', 422, 16, 22, 860958) Of this type of shanti there are higher and
('93', 422, 17, 23, 861002) higher grades of which the Gita speaks as, for example, (IV.
('93', 422, 17, 24, 861063) 39) para shanti and (V.
