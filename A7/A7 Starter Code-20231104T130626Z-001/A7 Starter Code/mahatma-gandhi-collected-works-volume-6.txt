('6', 0, 2, 3, 88) HOUSE OF COMMONS, November 5, 1906
('6', 0, 3, 4, 123) DEAR SIR, A meeting of the Liberal, Labour and Nationalist Members of this House will take place at 6 p.m.
('6', 0, 3, 5, 230) on Wednesday next, the 7th inst.
('6', 0, 3, 6, 263) in the Grand Committee Room, to hear the British Indian Deputation that has arrived from the Transvaal, in connection with the Ordinance passed by the Legislative Council of that Colony, termed the Asiatic Law Amendment Ordinance, and to pass a resolution.
('6', 0, 3, 7, 520) In the opinion of the Delegates, the Ordinance reduces the British Indian settlers of the Transvaal to a position much worse than they occupied under the Boer regime and even than that of the Kaffirs.
('6', 0, 3, 8, 721) They contend that the Ordinance in question is in contravention of promises repeatedly made by British Ministers and in conflict with British traditions.
('6', 0, 3, 9, 875) The undersigned trust that you will be good enough to attend the meeting.
('6', 0, 4, 10, 949) We are,
('6', 0, 5, 11, 957) Yours faithfully, HENRY COTTON R. LEHMANN H. COX J. M. ROBERTSON CHARLES W. DILKE A. H. SCOTT

('6', 5, 4, 5, 4760) MY LORD,
('6', 5, 5, 6, 4769) I beg to draw your attention to the copy of Indian Opinion for the 13th of October, herewith enclosed.
('6', 5, 5, 7, 4872) It contains the leading article The Thin End, about which I have already had the honour to write to you, also a report of the case of Mahomed Hafejee Moosa on page 745 entitled War on Infants.
('6', 5, 5, 8, 5065) I venture to think that the report brings into prominent relief the difficulties of British Indians (even infants) in the Transvaal.

('6', 5, 9, 12, 5333) [HOTEL CECIL, LONDON,] November 5, 1906
('6', 5, 10, 13, 5373) DEAR SIR, I am much obliged to you for your letter of the 5th instant.
('6', 5, 10, 14, 5444) I enclose herewith the Representation submitted to Lord Elgin, and also a circular letter addressed to the Liberal and other Members
('6', 5, 11, 15, 5577) 1 The address at the top would suggest that the letter was from Dadabhai Naoroji, but this copy was found among Gandhiji's papers.
('6', 5, 11, 16, 5708) Gandhiji's letter to him dated November 17 (vide Letter to Dadabhai Naoroji, 17 11 1906) shows that, during the Deputation's stay in England, Mr. Naoroji sent all papers received from South Africa to Gandhiji who returned them offering comment and explanation and sometimes suggesting courses of action.
('6', 5, 11, 17, 6012) It is thus very likely that Gandhiji drafted the letter because of his ready familiarity with the South African situation.

('6', 6, 1, 2, 6177) of the House of Commons who are taking active interest in the question of the status of British Indians in the Transvaal in the light of the Asiatic Law Amendment Ordinance.
('6', 6, 1, 3, 6351) You may have seen that Lord Elgin receives the Deputation on Thursday next at 3 oclock.
('6', 6, 1, 4, 6439) I also enclose a copy of the Representation 1 made to Lord Elgin by five young Indians from South Africa who are studying either for the Bar or for the medical profession.
('6', 6, 1, 5, 6611) Your letter encourages me [to] seek your personal acquaintance.
('6', 6, 1, 6, 6675) May I ask you to give me an interview some time after next Thursday, and if it is convenient to you, we might lunch together at the Hotel and talk over the matter that has brought Mr. Ally and myself to London.

('6', 15, 7, 12, 19493) DEAR SIR,
('6', 15, 8, 13, 19503) I thank you for your note.
('6', 15, 8, 14, 19530) It will give Mr. Ally and me very great pleasure to have you for breakfast on Friday at 9 oclock.
('6', 15, 8, 15, 19628) I do not know whether the interview with Lord Elgin is open to the Members, but as many enquiries have been made I am asking his Private Secretary.
('6', 15, 8, 16, 19776) However, will it not perhaps be as well for you to enquire at the Colonial Office?
('6', 15, 8, 17, 19859) I have suggested this to Mr. Brown.
('6', 15, 8, 18, 19895) I very much value your advice about the meeting being public.
('6', 15, 8, 19, 19957) I entirely agree with you in thinking that we have everything to gain by all our movements being open to the public, so just, I feel, is our cause.
('6', 15, 8, 20, 20105) If however the meeting is not public, I should be at the Hotel immediately after the interview and if it is not inconvenient to you, you may await me at the Hotel after this.
('6', 15, 8, 21, 20280) I do not think the interview is likely to last beyond half past five.
('6', 15, 8, 22, 20350) Would you care to attend the meeting of the Members of the House of Commons tomorrow at 6 p.m.
('6', 15, 8, 23, 20445) in the Grand Committee Room 2 I think I sent you a copy of the Circular Letter 3 yesterday.

('6', 17, 7, 9, 22012) 1 You will readily excuse the mistake when I inform you that I received instructions from Mr. Scott at 8 p.m.
('6', 17, 7, 10, 22122) on Monday, and that I had to have these Circular Letters printed and posted the same night.
('6', 17, 7, 11, 22214) It was with difficulty that I was able to find a printer, and it would have been impossible to do the thing but for assistance that was volunteered.
('6', 17, 7, 12, 22363) However, there was no time left for examining the proof copy; hence the error.

('6', 18, 6, 7, 22854) COLONIAL OFFICE
('6', 18, 9, 8, 22870) I have the honour to acknowledge your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to my request for an interview with Lord Elgin on the position of British Indians in Natal.
('6', 18, 9, 9, 23042) I have no desire to open the whole position, but if His Lordship would be graciously pleased to grant me an interview, I shall be able to show the inner working of the Natal legislation.
('6', 18, 9, 10, 23229) I was privileged to come into very close contact with the late Sir John Robinson 1 and the late Mr. Harry Escombe, who were the joint authors of the Immigration Restriction Act and the Dealers' Licenses Act.
('6', 18, 9, 11, 23437) These two, and especially the latter, are the cause of very great and constant irritation.
('6', 18, 9, 12, 23528) Very serious injustice, in my humble opinion, has often been done in the administration of the Licenses Act.
('6', 18, 10, 13, 23637) I invite His Lordship's attention to the fact that even after the Act was passed, there was a confidential despatch from Mr. Chamberlain to the Natal Ministry as to the operation of the Act.
('6', 18, 10, 14, 23828) The despatch was partly published, and it stated that unless the municipal bodies exercised the arbitrary powers given to them in virtue of the Licenses Act in a reasonable manner, it might become necessary to amend the Act.
('6', 18, 10, 15, 24053) I am aware that His Lordship's intervention as to these Acts can only be diplomatic, and it is such intervention I would like to invoke.
('6', 18, 10, 16, 24190) The object of the interview is to the best of my ability to place the position so before His Lordship as to enlist His Lordship's active

('6', 19, 1, 2, 24446) intervention so far as it may be consistent with the traditional policy of the Colonial Office.
('6', 19, 1, 3, 24542) The new Bill 1 introduced by Mr. Ralph Tatham in the Legislative Assembly makes it all the more imperative for me to approach His Lordship.
('6', 19, 1, 4, 24682) I regret exceedingly that the Authority referred to in my letter was not enclosed with it: it was an oversight, for which I beg to be excused.
('6', 19, 1, 5, 24825) I have now sent it through Mr. Ritch, the Secretary to the Transvaal Deputation.
('6', 19, 1, 6, 24906) As I have not kept a copy of the Authority, may I ask you to let me have one.
('6', 19, 2, 7, 24984) I have the honour to remain,

('6', 20, 7, 10, 26329) A meeting of more than a hundred Members of the House of Commons, drawn from the Liberal, Labour and Nationalist Parties, was addressed by Gandhiji and Mr. Ally in the Grand Committee Room of the House.
('6', 20, 8, 11, 26532) LONDON, November 7, 1906]
('6', 20, 9, 12, 26558) ...Mr. Gandhi said that in 1885 British Indians were described in documents
('6', 20, 10, 13, 26634) 1 Several members spoke.
('6', 20, 10, 14, 26659) Sir Henry Cotton, the Chairman of the meeting, said that, under this Ordinance, British Indians were placed under the surveillance of the police in a manner which could not be differentiated from the treatment given in England to prisoners who were released from jail.
('6', 20, 10, 15, 26928) Mr. Ally appealed in the name of Christianity and humanity for the support of British Members of Parliament in freeing Indians from a degrading law.
('6', 20, 10, 16, 27077) Sir Charles Dilke said that it was notorious that there was a great jealousy of Indians because they made such admirable shopkeepers and medical men.
('6', 20, 10, 17, 27227) Mr. Joseph Walton, Mr. Harold Cox and Mr. Higham supported a proposal to sign a memorial to the Prime Minister regarding the status of British Indians in the Transvaal.
('6', 20, 10, 18, 27396) Sir Henry Cotton summed up the feelings of the meeting by saying that the question had become one of Imperial importance and had thus been taken out of the realm of party politics.
('6', 20, 10, 19, 27577) A resolution supporting the objectives of the Deputation was then unanimously adopted.

('6', 21, 1, 3, 27823) They were then under great disabilities; they could not hold landed property, except in Locations that might be set apart for them for sanitary purposes, and they were required to register themselves and pay a fee to the Transvaal Government.
('6', 21, 1, 4, 28066) Lord Derby tried to mitigate their grievances, and Mr. Chamberlain afterwards wrote a strong despatch to the Boer Government about British Indians, whom he described as honourable men and an asset of great importance to the Transvaal.
('6', 21, 1, 5, 28301) The result of this was that British Indians went about the country as free citizens, and there was absolutely no restriction upon their movements.
('6', 21, 1, 6, 28448) Recently a new Ordinance had been passed and British Indian subjects were classed with Asiatics and were treated in a most degrading manner....

('6', 21, 7, 12, 28912) HUMBLY SHEWETH
('6', 21, 8, 13, 28927) That your Petitioners are all London wholesale Shipping Firms and Merchants, having branches in, or in connection with, South Africa.
('6', 21, 8, 14, 29061) Most of your Petitioners have come into direct contact with British Indian Merchants in South Africa, including the Transvaal.
('6', 21, 8, 15, 29188) From their experience of British Indian Merchants in the Transvaal your Petitioners are in a position to state that the British Indian Merchants in the Transvaal are on the whole an honest and honourable body of men, and their connection with them has always
('6', 21, 9, 16, 29447) 1 The petition was clearly drafted by Gandhiji.
('6', 21, 9, 17, 29495) It was enclosed with the Letter to S. Hollick, of 8 11 1906.

('6', 22, 1, 2, 29599) been of a most satisfactory nature.
('6', 22, 1, 3, 29635) In your Petitioners opinion their presence in the Transvaal is a distinct gain to the Transvaal community in general.
('6', 22, 1, 4, 29753) At the very least their presence there tends to the distinct benefit of the Transvaal community by reducing the cost of living expenses to those who can least afford to pay the exorbitantly high prices and profits demanded by the European firms.
('6', 22, 1, 5, 29999) Your Petitioners have read the Asiatic Law Amendment Ordinance, and in your Petitioners opinion the Ordinance will submit British Indians in the Transvaal to totally unnecessary indignity and hardship.
('6', 22, 1, 6, 30201) Your Petitioners desire to associate themselves entirely with the sentiments expressed in the Memorial submitted to His Excellency the Governor of the Transvaal by Mr. William Hosken and other notable European residents in the Transvaal in the month of April, 1903. 1
('6', 22, 2, 7, 30469) In your Petitioners humble opinion, while it is desirable that immigration of British Indians should be regulated in order to allay popular prejudice, they think that it should be along the Cape or Natal lines, and should not savour of class distinction.
('6', 22, 2, 8, 30724) Your Petitioners therefore pray that Your Lordship will be pleased to advise His Majesty to disallow the Ordinance above mentioned, or to grant such relief as will adequately protect the British Indians who have settled in the Transvaal.

('6', 22, 5, 12, 31139) November 8, 1906
('6', 22, 6, 13, 31156) By the time this is in print Lord Elgin will have received what may be described as a very strong deputation representing all manner of opinion, and including well known Members of Parliament and
('6', 22, 7, 14, 31352) 1 Vide Letter to Lieutenant Governor, 1 5 1903, enclosure.
('6', 22, 8, 15, 31411) 2 This statement shows direct knowledge of happenings both in the Transvaal and England; it was moreover found among Gandhiji's papers.
('6', 22, 8, 16, 31547) These facts would' suggest that the statement was drafted by him
('6', 23, 0, 1, 31612) 24 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 23, 1, 2, 31653) Anglo Indians of great experience.
('6', 23, 1, 3, 31688) It is remarkable how the Delegates from the Transvaal have received support and sympathy from all quarters.
('6', 23, 1, 4, 31796) A most striking illustration perhaps was afforded by the meeting of the Liberal, Labour, and Nationalist Members of the House of Commons at the Grand Committee Room on Wednesday last under the chairmanship of Sir Henry Cotton, the Member for Nottingham East.
('6', 23, 1, 5, 32055) The attendance was fully one hundred.
('6', 23, 1, 6, 32093) The Members gave the Delegates a very sympathetic hearing, and many of them showed their active sympathy by making short speeches for or questioning the Delegates.
('6', 23, 1, 7, 32257) A resolution supporting the objects of the Delegation was unanimously adopted.
('6', 23, 1, 8, 32336) One of the Members even wanted to know why the Conservative Members had not been invited to the meeting.
('6', 23, 1, 9, 32441) Sir Charles Dilke, who has consistently championed the cause of British Indians in South Africa, immediately interposed that it was an oversight and that this was a question in which they could certainly secure Conservative co operation.
('6', 23, 1, 10, 32679) They and the Liberal Parliament always joined the the Conservatives in securing redress for their Indian fellow subjects in South Africa.
('6', 23, 1, 11, 32817) Mr. Scott, who was the organizer of the meeting, remarked that the only reason why the Circular Letter 1 was confined to the Liberal, Labour, and Nationalist Members was that the Government that was being approached by the Delegates was a Liberal Government, and it was considered only right that the meeting should take the form it did.
('6', 23, 1, 12, 33155) At the same time they would undoubtedly ask for and be willing to secure the co operation of Conservative Members.
('6', 23, 1, 13, 33270) Sir Henry Cotton added that on the deputation were represented very staunch Conservatives.
('6', 23, 1, 14, 33361) These proceedings take the question out of party politics, and as Sir Charles Dilke has often said, it becomes a question of Imperial importance.
('6', 23, 1, 15, 33507) These proceedings ought to strengthen the hands of Lord Elgin and encourage him to veto the Ordinance, or at least to appoint a commission on which the Delegates lay so much stress.
('6', 23, 1, 16, 33689) The Representation submitted to Lord Elgin exhaustively deals with the facts of the case, and shows clearly how unnecessary the legislation is, and how much harder it is than Law 3 of 1885. It is
('6', 23, 2, 17, 33885) 1 Vide Circular for Meeting at House of Commons, 5 11 1906.
('6', 24, 0, 1, 33945) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 25
('6', 24, 1, 2, 33988) undoubtedly not an amendment, but a new law, making class distinctions of a very offensive nature.
('6', 24, 1, 3, 34087) The prayer of the Delegates is very reasonable.
('6', 24, 1, 4, 34135) They ask Lord Elgin to sanction legislation along the Cape or Natal line[s], leaving it open to British Indian settlers to import assistants and such other men as may be required for attention to their businesses.
('6', 24, 1, 5, 34349) If such legislation be passed it would remove all fear of an unrestricted Asiatic influx.
('6', 24, 1, 6, 34439) There would then be no necessity for the espionage contemplated by the Ordinance.
('6', 24, 1, 7, 34521) That the lot of the British Indians is hard enough without any such legislation is shown by a recent prosecution of an Asiatic child 1
('6', 24, 2, 8, 34656) under eleven years of age for entering the Colony of the Transvaal in the company of his father.
('6', 24, 2, 9, 34753) We cannot do better than quote the words of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Transvaal who quashed the conviction of the child:
('6', 24, 3, 10, 34894) The conviction is wholly bad.
('6', 24, 3, 11, 34924) Here is a child of between ten and eleven years of age, charged not with an ordinary Common Law offence, but with the offence of entering the Transvaal by means of a permit improperly obtained.
('6', 24, 3, 12, 35118) It does appearat any rate, there is evidence on the record to showthat the thumb mark of this infant was pressed on a permit belonging to someone else.
('6', 24, 3, 13, 35270) But this child was not doli capax at all.
('6', 24, 3, 14, 35312) The child was put into the box, and said he did not know what a permit was, and had never seen one; and I dare say he was speaking the truth.
('6', 24, 3, 15, 35454) There can be no doubt that the conviction cannot be sustained for one moment.
('6', 24, 4, 16, 35532) The administrative order, of course, still remains.
('6', 24, 4, 17, 35584) The Magistrate has seriously ordered this infant to leave the Transvaal at the expiration of the term of imprisonment, or upon a certain date, whichever happens sooner.
('6', 24, 4, 18, 35753) If the child does not go awayand I do not suppose he can go away unless someone takes himhe will then, possibly, be brought up before the Magistrate as a criminal.
('6', 24, 4, 19, 35917) But I trust that course will not be taken by the authorities.
('6', 24, 4, 20, 35979) I cannot understand why this case was taken up at all.
('6', 24, 4, 21, 36034) It is a very important matter.
('6', 24, 4, 22, 36065) This child is an Indian; but the same would apply to any white child (not one of the exempted classes under the Ordinance) entering the Transvaal; and if it applies to a child of eleven, why not to a child in arms!
('6', 24, 4, 23, 36280) Surely it was never intended that such an administrative order should be made, in circumstances of this kind.
('6', 24, 4, 24, 36390) This legislation is sufficiently open to criticism without that.
('6', 24, 4, 25, 36455) If there is anything which can bring the administration of such a
('6', 24, 5, 26, 36521) 1 Mahomed Hafeji Moosa; Vide Transvaal Permit Ordinance, 29 9 1906.
('6', 25, 0, 1, 36589) 26 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 25, 1, 2, 36630) law into ridicule and contempt it is administration conducted on the lines of this case.
('6', 25, 1, 3, 36719) I trust we shall hear nothing more about the administrative order.
('6', 25, 2, 4, 36786) We had only the other day an example of what The Rand Daily Mail described as War on Women 1 In the above case, we have an instance of what Indian Opinion describes to be War on Infants.
('6', 25, 2, 5, 36973) Cases such as these call for prompt amelioration, and not for greater severity.
('6', 25, 2, 6, 37053) The doctrine of relying on men on the spot will be carried to ridiculous extremes if Lord Elgin does not heed the representations made to him on behalf of British Indians in the Transvaal.
('6', 25, 2, 7, 37242) Very strong support is given to the delegation by a personal appeal 2 of five British Indians addressed to Lord Elgin in connection with the Ordinance.
('6', 25, 2, 8, 37394) They are all students from South Africa studying for the Bar or for Medicine, born or brought up in South Africa, and in their words, South Africa is more our home than India.
('6', 25, 2, 9, 37570) Even our mother tongue is English, our parents having brought us up to speak that language from our infancy.
('6', 25, 2, 10, 37679) Three of us are Christians, one a Mahomedan, and one a Hindoo. Are these men, after they have become barristers or doctors, on their return to South Africa, to be debarred from entering the Transvaal, or are they to carry tickets of leave as Sir Henry Cotton described the passes to be issued under the new Ordinance?
('6', 25, 2, 11, 37997) If such legislation is to be the vogue in the Colonies, it would be a mercy not to allow the British Indians to receive a liberal education in England at all, because a memory of the good times passed by them in England would only enhance the sting of humiliation to be undergone by them in Colonies which are British only in name and un British in conduct.

('6', 26, 7, 8, 39004) [LONDON, November 8, 1906] 2
('6', 26, 8, 9, 39033) MY LORD,
('6', 26, 9, 10, 39042) Mr. Ally, my colleague, and I have to tender our respectful thanks to Your Lordship for receiving this Deputation.
('6', 26, 9, 11, 39157) The task before Mr. Ally and myself is, I know, exceedingly delicate and difficult, supported though we are by friends who have always helped us in our troubles, and representing different schools of politics, and who have come to give us the weight of their influence at considerable trouble to themselves, especially on a day like this.
('6', 26, 9, 12, 39496) Your Lordship is aware that there was a great Indian Mass Meeting held at which resolutions were adopted.
('6', 26, 9, 13, 39602) The text of these resolutions was cabled to Your Lordship 3 and in reply 4 Your Lordship was pleasedto send a cablegram informing the British Indian Asso ciation that Your Lordship had approved of the draft Ordinance in
('6', 26, 10, 14, 39822) 1 At one time Assistant Editor, The Times of India; Secretary of Indian section of Royal Society of Arts; he interested himself in the problems of uncovenanted civil services of India.
('6', 26, 11, 15, 40007) 2 This was presented when the Deputation met Lord Elgin on November 8, 1906.
('6', 26, 12, 16, 40084) 3 The only cable available on the subject does not contain the text of the resolutions but only requests the withholding of Imperial sanction to the Ordinance.
('6', 26, 12, 17, 40244) Vide Cable to Secretary of State for Colonies, 8 9 1906 and Cable to Viceroy of India, 8 9 1906.
('6', 26, 13, 18, 40341) 4 For a summary, vide The Transvaal Ordinance, 29 9 1906.
('6', 27, 0, 1, 40399) 28 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 27, 1, 2, 40440) that it gave some measure of relief to British Indians.
('6', 27, 1, 3, 40496) We, who are on the spot and to whom the Ordinance applies, think, with the greatest deference, that, instead of granting relief, it imposes on British Indians in the Transvaal hardships to which, so far as I am aware, there is no parallel in Colonial legislation.
('6', 27, 1, 4, 40760) The Ordinance assumes that every Indian is capable of passing his permit to someone else so that he may unlawfully enter the Colony.
('6', 27, 1, 5, 40893) It, therefore, violates the time honoured maxim that every one is to be presumed to be innocent until he is found to be guilty.
('6', 27, 1, 6, 41021) This Ordinance condemns every Indian as guilty and leaves no room for him even to show that he is innocent.
('6', 27, 1, 7, 41129) It has been called an amendment of Law 3 of 1885. With the greatest respect I submit that it is no amendment whatsoever of the Law, but that it is a totally new Ordinance accentuating colour prejudice in the most offensive manner.
('6', 27, 1, 8, 41360) The system of passes that the Ordinance introduces is unknown, so far as British Indians are concerned, in any other part of the British Dominions, and it undoubtedly reduces Indians to a level lower than that of the Kaffirs.
('6', 27, 1, 9, 41586) The reason for such legislation is said to be that there is a large unauthorized influx of British Indians and that the British Indian community or the British Indian Associa tion are making an attempt to introduce without authority a large number of Indians into the Colony; in other words, that the community is engaged in a criminal breach of the Peace Preservation Ordinance, and that it is in order to prevent such an attempt that the Ordinance has been passed.
('6', 27, 1, 10, 42053) It is, therefore, a measure of punishment.
('6', 27, 1, 11, 42096) One often hears of punitive measures being adopted in connection with communities some members of which have committed grave political crimes or severe breaches of the Common Law of the country.
('6', 27, 1, 12, 42291) In this instance, the whole community is to be punished in a degrading manner for a crime against a statute restrictive of the liberty of the subject which is misapplied to British Indians, and a crime which the community has stoutly repudiated.
('6', 27, 1, 13, 42537) Such, in the humble opinion of the Indian community, is the Ordinance about which we are approaching Your Lordship.
('6', 27, 1, 14, 42653) There are three things which are stated to be introduced into the Ordinance in the nature of relief to the British Indiansthe remission of the 3 fee; but we have shown that there is no remission at all, as all who are at present in the Transvaal have paid the 3. The second is the authority which is given to the Government by the Ordinance to issue tem porary permits, but this again is no relief because it is superfluous.
('6', 28, 0, 1, 43078) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 29
('6', 28, 1, 2, 43121) Such authority has always existed and been exercised at the discretion of the Government: there are today British Indians holding temporary permits.
('6', 28, 1, 3, 43270) There is again the relief to holders of temporary permits from the operation of the Liquor Ordinance.
('6', 28, 1, 4, 43372) That relief the British Indians never asked for, and so far as it is applicable to them, it is interpreted as a wanton insult.
('6', 28, 2, 5, 43499) There is one thing that the Ordinance undoubtedly rectifies, and that is by restoring [it] to the heirs of the late Aboo Baker Ahmed who held land in his own name before 1885. This is individual in character, and I have no doubt that if the price the heirs have to pay for getting land which is theirs by right be the degradation of the whole Indian community of the Transvaal, I am sure that even the heirs themselves would not care to pay it, and the community will certainly never feel in any way thankful for such relief.
('6', 28, 2, 6, 44025) It will be a most surprising thing if, after repeated promises and pledges, an Ordinance of this nature is countenanced by Your Lordship.
('6', 28, 2, 7, 44163) I shall venture to quote extracts from Mr. Chamberlains despatches, also from those of Lord Milner and Mr. Lyttelton, to show what they intended to do after the war....
('6', 28, 3, 8, 44332) It is common knowledge that before the War the British Government used every effort possible that Law 3 of 1885 should be repealed.
('6', 28, 3, 9, 44464) The condition today is changed, but we had hoped that it would change for the better, seeing that there is no foreign government to deal with, but our own Government.
('6', 28, 3, 10, 44631) Unhappily, we are now in the position of strangers in what may be called our own land.
('6', 28, 3, 11, 44718) We have always endeavoured to conciliate prejudice and with that view we have made suggestions which have been adopted in the self governing Colonies.
('6', 28, 3, 12, 44869) Failing, however, the adoption of these suggestions, we have asked that a commission of enquiry may be appointed.
('6', 28, 3, 13, 44983) This is the time honoured British custom.
('6', 28, 3, 14, 45025) Whenever a new step has been taken, a royal commission has preceded it.
('6', 28, 3, 15, 45097) The latest instance, perhaps, is that of the Aliens Act in the United Kingdom.
('6', 28, 3, 16, 45176) Before any steps were taken, a commission investigated the charges made against the aliens, and into the question of the adequacy of the existing laws, and into the question as to what new laws were
('6', 28, 4, 17, 45375) 1 The extracts, which are not available, were presumably to be inserted here.
('6', 29, 0, 1, 45453) 30 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 29, 1, 2, 45494) necessary.
('6', 29, 1, 3, 45505) We have asked for a similar commission regarding the British Indians in the Transvaal.
('6', 29, 1, 4, 45592) We believe that we are entitled to this, in view of the very grave charges I have referred to.
('6', 29, 1, 5, 45687) We have been asking all these years for bread, but we have received stones in the shape of this Ordinance.
('6', 29, 1, 6, 45794) We have therefore every reason to hope that Your Lordship will not countenance the legislation above described.

('6', 30, 2, 3, 46607) CONFIDENTIAL COLONIAL OFFICE, Thursday, November 8, 1906
('6', 30, 3, 4, 46664) PROCEEDINGS AT A DEPUTATION TO THE RT.
('6', 30, 3, 5, 46703) THE EARL OF ELGIN
('6', 30, 4, 6, 46721) ON BRITISH INDIAN SUBJECTS IN SOUTH AFRICA
('6', 30, 5, 7, 46764) The deputation consisted of the following gentlemen:
('6', 30, 6, 8, 46817) Lord Stanley of Alderley Mr. H. O. Ally } Mr Gandhi } Delegates from [the] Transvaal Sir Lepel Griffin, K.C.S.I. Mr. J. D. Rees, C.I.E., M.P. Sir George Birdwood, K.C.S.I. Sir Henry Cotton, K.C.S.I., M.P. Mr. Naoroji Sir M. Bhownaggree, K.C.I.E. Mr. Ameer Ali Mr. Harold Cox, M.P. Mr. Thornton, C.S.I.
('6', 30, 7, 9, 47119) THE EARL OF ELGIN: I should just like to say, gentlemen, that I made this interview a private one because I thought, from experience of other meetings of the same sort, we should be better able to discuss the matter friendly across the table without the presence of public reporters; at the same time, I am quite aware that the deputation wish to go into matters of some detail, and therefore I have made arrangements for a note to be taken so that anything which may be said shall be on record.
('6', 30, 8, 10, 47615) Then I should like to say one other word.
('6', 30, 8, 11, 47657) I recognize among the deputation some of those with whom I have had the pleasure of working in India, and I hope they have explained to the deputation, if it was necessary, that my sentiments would all be in favour of doing anything I could for the interests of British Indians.
('6', 30, 9, 12, 47936) SIR LEPEL GRIFFIN: My Lord, what you have just said makes my duty in
('6', 30, 10, 13, 48005) 1 While our source is the minutes in Colonial Office records, incomplete versions are found in Gandhiji's typewritten office copy S. N. 4512 and also in The South African Blue Book, C. D. 3308.
('6', 31, 0, 1, 48199) 32 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 31, 1, 2, 48240) introducing the Delegates more easy.
('6', 31, 1, 3, 48277) We are very much obliged to your Lordship for admitting this deputation of men who are all known to you as gentlemen connected with India, who have been most of them in India themselves, and are all interested in India, and we are very glad, without any question of party feelingbecause all sides are represented in this deputation to introduce to you the Delegates from South Africa: Mr. Gandhi, who is, as your Lordship is aware, a barrister of the Inner Temple and a man who, in the late Boer war and in the late rising in Natal, has done most excellent work for the country in organizing ambulance corps and in other wayshe practises now in Johannesburgand Mr. Ally, his colleague, who is the representative of the Mohammedan part of the Indian community in the Transvaal, a merchant of very good position and the founder, and I believe the Chairman, of the Islamic Association in the Transvaal.
('6', 31, 1, 4, 49177) To those gentlemen I propose to leave any details of the Ordinance which has now been passed and which we are about to ask His Majestys Government to veto.
('6', 31, 1, 5, 49333) But I would like to say a few words in explaining the matter now before the Colonial Office, and I shall take up the time of your Lordship only for a few minutes.
('6', 31, 2, 6, 49496) I have been asked to present this deputation principally, I fancy, because I happen to be the Chairman of the Council of the East India Association, of which your Lordship is a distinguished Vice President, but the question which the East India Association has so often urged upon successive Colonial Secretaries and Secretaries for India and Viceroys of India is not directly concerned in our presence here today.
('6', 31, 2, 7, 49911) The bed rock, as your Lordship is aware, of the East India Associations protests [is] that all well conducted, loyal, and industrious British subjects, whatever their race or colour, should receive equal rights in all Colonies of the British Empire; that is the bed rock of justice which has always been refused in the past, but on which the East India Association, which is represented largely here today, begs to continue to rely and from which it must continue to make its protest.
('6', 31, 2, 8, 50396) That, my Lord, is not precisely the question which this deputation desires to put forward this afternoon; they are not making any of those large claims which we have before made; they only ask that a certain Ordinance applying to the Transvaal alone may not receive the sanction of His Majestys Government.
('6', 31, 3, 9, 50703) A few words only are necessary on this point.
('6', 31, 3, 10, 50749) During the Boer Government the British Indians were treated with considerable harshness, but their immigration into the Transvaal was not prohibited, and with the exception of a fee for a licence for adult traders, they were not interfered with.
('6', 31, 3, 11, 50995) But their position was an exceedingly uncomfortable one, and many protests were raised which, we understood, when the country fell into the hands of the English, would be redressed.
('6', 31, 3, 12, 51177) So far from being redressed, their position is made worse and the rules for registration and identification were made exceedingly more rigorous.
('6', 31, 3, 13, 51322) The Ordinance which has now been passed
('6', 32, 0, 1, 51362) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 33
('6', 32, 1, 2, 51405) makes, whatever people in South Africa may choose to say, their position infinitely worse and more degrading.
('6', 32, 1, 3, 51515) It may be said that in the Transvaal these rules are for the benefit of the Indians, but the toad under the harrow knows where the harrow grips him, and the Indians in the Transvaal consider that the new regulations of this Ordinance are a grievance and an insult which is almost too grievous to be borne; and I for one most strongly support their claim and their protest.
('6', 32, 2, 4, 51888) Under this Ordinance every one in the Transvaal is exposed to the most rigorous investigation; the impressions of his fingers are to be recorded on every pass; no one is allowed inman, woman or childwithout registration of so rigorous a character that has been unheard of in any civilized country within my recollection.
('6', 32, 2, 5, 52209) Under this regulation every Indian in the Transvaal, whether an adult male, whether a woman, or whether a child, and even babes in arms will be obliged to be registered under such conditions as ordinarily apply only to convicts in a civilized country; and evasion or ignorance or even forgetfulness on this point is punished by crushing fines, by imprisonment with hard labour, by expulsion, and by ruin.
('6', 32, 2, 6, 52614) You, my Lord, who have been Viceroy of India, and whose sympathy is with the country, must know that legislation of this sort is unheard of under the British flag; indeed, today in Europe, I may say without any exaggeration, that, with the exception of the Russian legislation against the Jews, there is no legislation comparable to this on the continent of Europe; and in England, if we wanted a similar case, we should have to go back to the time of the Plantagenets.
('6', 32, 3, 7, 53084) And against whom is this legislation directed?
('6', 32, 3, 8, 53131) Against the most orderly, honourable, industrious, temperate race in the world, people of our own stock and blood, with whom our own language has as a sister language been connected.
('6', 32, 3, 9, 53314) There is no occasion, in the presence of people connected with India, who know its history, to say what the Indian community is today; it is almost an insult to refer to it.
('6', 32, 4, 10, 53488) And by whom is this legislation instigated?
('6', 32, 4, 11, 53532) I am told, and I believe it, that it is not by the best part of the British community in the Transvaal, who are, I believe, in favour of giving all reasonable privileges to British Indian subjects; it is by the alien foreign population in the Transvaal who are perhaps to some extent inconvenienced by Indian traders who are so very much more temperate and industrious than themselves.
('6', 32, 4, 12, 53918) It does not come from the English.
('6', 32, 4, 13, 53953) The legislation is prompted, and the prejudice against the Indians is encouraged, by the aliens, by Russian Jews, by Syrians, by German Jews, by every class of aliens, the very off scourings of the international sewers of Europe.
('6', 32, 4, 14, 54183) The English residents, against whom I do not wish to say one word of criticism, are a part, in my mind, of the Transvaal, but the Transvaal is only a Colony by conquest, not by settlement, and it is the aliens who are opposed to this honourable Indian community.
('6', 33, 0, 1, 54446) 34 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 33, 1, 2, 54487) My Lord, I do not wish to take up more of your time, but what I wish to say is that today we ask you, as representing His Majestys Government, and as we know your sympathies are with the Indians, over whom you have ruled with so much distinction, to procure the vetoing of this Ordinance.
('6', 33, 1, 3, 54776) No large questions are brought before you today by this deputation.
('6', 33, 1, 4, 54844) They are not asking for political rights; they are not asking for gratitude for their great and devoted services in the Transvaal war where so many of them lost their lives in their devotion to England, doing as courageous work as any one of the members of the armies which were sent by England, by Australia, or by Canada.
('6', 33, 1, 5, 55168) Those services have not been recognized; on the contrary, they have been ignored and further burdens have been placed upon them.
('6', 33, 1, 6, 55297) We ask for nothing today except the merest barest justice.
('6', 33, 1, 7, 55356) We ask that the whips which the Boers have inflicted upon us may not be changed into scorpions wielded by the British Government.
('6', 33, 2, 8, 55486) I would say in conclusion that we hope everything from the present
('6', 33, 3, 9, 55553) Government, and for this reason, that the grievances of the Chinese have received the
('6', 33, 4, 10, 55639) utmost sympathy at the hands of the Government, but, so far as this deputation is
('6', 33, 5, 11, 55721) concerned, the Chinese and other alien nations do not count.
('6', 33, 5, 12, 55782) We ask not for the
('6', 33, 6, 13, 55801) Chinese, but for our own fellow subjects, and we ask that justice, if not generosity,
('6', 33, 7, 14, 55887) may be dealt out to them and that your Lordship will save them from insult and
('6', 33, 8, 15, 55966) oppression.
('6', 33, 9, 16, 55978) It was at your Lordships request that this deputation was a small one; it might have been indefinitely extended.
('6', 33, 9, 17, 56091) This is a test casea question of going forward or going back.
('6', 33, 9, 18, 56153) Your Lordship, as a past Viceroy of India, must know that the attention of the whole of India, 300 millions of Indians, is intent today upon the decision which will be given in this test case, and I beg your Lordship to think and to remember that, besides the Indians of Indian birth, against whom the insults of this Ordinance are directed, there are the whole body of Indian officials, to which I and most of the members of this deputation belong, who are insulted with the natives of India.
('6', 33, 9, 19, 56647) Is it to be supposed that we who have worked with, we who have governed this province of India under your Lordship and under your predecessors and successors, have been governing degraded creatures who are placed lower even than the Zulus and Russian Jews?
('6', 33, 9, 20, 56904) No, my Lord.
('6', 33, 9, 21, 56917) We trust to you to do what you can to defend the people whom you have governed so well.
('6', 33, 9, 22, 57005) And I will beg you to excuse any exciting warmth in my way of speaking, because I assure you that any warmth in my words is very much exceeded by the feeling of shame and resentment which fills my heart at the way in which the British Indians of the Transvaal are treated today by the settlers (I will not call them Colonists) of that country.
('6', 34, 0, 1, 57349) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 35
('6', 34, 1, 2, 57392) MR. GANDHI: Both Mr. Ally and I are very much obliged to your Lordship for giving us the opportunity of placing the British Indian position before you.
('6', 34, 1, 3, 57544) Supported though we are by distinguished Anglo Indian friends and others, I feel that the task before Mr. Ally and myself is very difficult, because your Lordship, in reply to the cablegram 1 sent to you through Lord Selborne, after the great British Indian mass meeting in Johannesburg, was pleased to inform the British Indian Association, that, although you would be pleased to give us every opportunity of stating our case, no good purpose was likely to be served as your Lordship had approved of the principle of the Ordinance, in that it gave some measure of relief to the British Indian community, though not as much as His Majestys Government would desire.
('6', 34, 1, 4, 58209) We who are the men on the spot and who are affected by the Ordinance in question have ventured to think otherwise.
('6', 34, 1, 5, 58324) We have felt that this Ordinance does not give us any relief whatsoever.
('6', 34, 1, 6, 58397) It is a measure which places British Indians in a far worse position than before and makes the lot of the British Indian well nigh intolerable.
('6', 34, 1, 7, 58541) Under the Ordinance the British Indian is assumed to be a criminal.
('6', 34, 1, 8, 58609) If a stranger, not knowing the circumstances of the Transvaal, were to read the Ordinance, he would have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that an Ordinance of that nature which carries so many penalties and wounds the British Indian community on all sides, must only apply to thieves or a gang of robbers.
('6', 34, 1, 9, 58924) I venture, therefore, to think that, although Sir Lepel Griffin has used strong 2 language in connection with the Ordinance, he has not at all exaggerated, but every word of it is justified.
('6', 34, 1, 10, 59115) At the same time I beg to state that the Ordinance, as amended, does not apply to British Indian females.
('6', 34, 1, 11, 59221) The draft Ordinance undoubtedly applied to females also, but owing to the very strong protest made by the British Indian Association, and by Mr. Ally separately as Chairman of the Hamidia Islamic Society, pointing out the great violence that would have been done to female sanctity, if I may say so, the Ordinance was amended so as to take females out of its operation.
('6', 34, 1, 12, 59591) But it applies to all adult males and even to children, in that the parents or guardians have to take out registra tion certificates for their children or wards as the case may be.

('6', 34, 3, 14, 59815) 2 The Original has strange.
('6', 35, 0, 1, 59843) 36 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 35, 1, 2, 59884) It is a fundamental maxim of the British law that every one is presumed to be innocent until he is found guilty, but the Ordinance reverses the process, and brands every Indian as guilty, and leaves no room for him to prove his innocence.
('6', 35, 1, 3, 60123) There is absolutely nothing proved against us and yet every British Indian, no matter what his status is, is to be condemned as guilty and not treated as an innocent man.
('6', 35, 1, 4, 60294) My Lord, an Ordinance of this nature [it] is not possible for British Indians to reconcile themselves to.
('6', 35, 1, 5, 60400) I do not know that such an Ordinance is applicable to free British subjects in any part of His Majestys Dominions.
('6', 35, 2, 6, 60515) Moreover, what the Transvaal thinks today the other Colonies think tomorrow.
('6', 35, 2, 7, 60592) When Lord Milner sprang his Bazaar Notice 1 on British Indians, the whole of South Africa rang with the Bazaar idea.
('6', 35, 2, 8, 60709) The term Bazaar is a misnomer; it has been really applied to Loca tions where trade is utterly impossible.
('6', 35, 2, 9, 60816) However, a proposal was seriously made, after a Bazaar Notice, by the then Mayor of Natal 2, Mr. Ellis Browne, that Indians should be relegated to Bazaars.
('6', 35, 2, 10, 60972) There is not the slightest reason why this Ordinance also, if it ever becomes law, should not be copied by the other parts of South Africa.
('6', 35, 2, 11, 61112) The position today in Natal is that even indentured Indians are not required to carry passes as contemplated by the Asiatic Law Amendment Ordinance; nor are there any penalties attached to the non carrying of passes as are defined in the Ordinance under discussion.
('6', 35, 2, 12, 61378) We have already shown in our humble representation that no relief has been granted by this Ordinance, because the remission of the 3 fee, referred to by Mr. Duncan, is quite illusory, because all we British Indians resident in the Transvaal who are obliged to pay 3 under Law 3 of 1885, and those who, under Lord Selbornes promise, are likely to be allowed to re enter the Transvaal, have paid the 3 already.
('6', 35, 3, 13, 61787) The authority to issue temporary permits is also superfluous in that the Government have already exercised the power, and there are today in the Transvaal several Indians in possession of temporary permits.
('6', 35, 3, 14, 61994) They are liable to be expelled from the Colony on the expiry of their permits.

('6', 36, 1, 2, 62177) The relief under the Liquor Ordinance 1 is, British Indians feel, a wanton insult.
('6', 36, 1, 3, 62260) So much was this recognized by the local Government that they immediately assured the Indians that it was not intended for British Indians at all, but for somebody else.
('6', 36, 1, 4, 62430) We have no connection with anybody else, and we have always endeavoured to show that the British Indians ought to be treated as British subjects, and ought not to be included with the general body of Asiatics with respect to whom there may be a need for some restrictions which ought not to apply to British Indians as British subjects.
('6', 36, 2, 5, 62767) There remains one more statement that is in connection with the land owned by the late Aboobaker.
('6', 36, 2, 6, 62865) 2 That land should belong to the heirs by right, but under the interpretation reluctantly put upon it by the Supreme Court, that it is only individual in character and does not touch the community, the land cannot be transmitted to the heirs.
('6', 36, 2, 7, 63108) The Ordinance is intended to rectify the error, but, as I had the honour to represent the heirs, I ventured to think that even they would not consent to pay for getting this relief at the price, in the nature of this Ordinance, for British Indians; and certainly the Indian community can never exchange for the relief given to their heirs of the land of Aboobaker an Ordinance of this nature, which requires them to pay so great a price for what is really their own.
('6', 36, 2, 8, 63575) So that under the Ordinance in that respect again there is absolutely no relief.
('6', 36, 2, 9, 63656) As I said before, we shall be, under the Ordinance, branded as criminals.
('6', 36, 3, 10, 63730) My Lord, the existing regulation is severe enough.
('6', 36, 3, 11, 63781) I hold in my hands returns from the Court of the Magistrate at Volksrust.
('6', 36, 3, 12, 63855) Over 150 successful prosecutions of Indians attempting to enter the Transvaal have taken place during the years 1905 and 1906. All these prosecutions, I venture to say, are by no means just.
('6', 36, 3, 13, 64046) I venture to believe that if these prosecutions were gone into you would see that some of them were absolutely groundless.
('6', 36, 4, 14, 64169) So far as the question of identification is concerned the present laws are quite enough.
('6', 36, 4, 15, 64258) I produce to your Lordship the registration certificate held by me, and it will show how complete it is to establish identification.
('6', 36, 4, 16, 64391) The present law can hardly be called an amendment.
('6', 36, 4, 17, 64442) I produce before your Lordship a registration receipt held by my

('6', 37, 0, 1, 64555) 38 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 37, 1, 2, 64596) colleague, Mr. Ally, from the Transvaal Government.
('6', 37, 1, 3, 64648) Your Lordship will see that it is merely a receipt for 3. The registration under the present Ordinance is of a different type.
('6', 37, 1, 4, 64775) When Lord Milner wished to enforce Law 3 of 1885 he suggested new registration.
('6', 37, 1, 5, 64855) We protested against it, but on his strong advice, as a voluntary act, we allowed ourselves to be newly registered, and hence the form produced before your Lordship.
('6', 37, 1, 6, 65021) At the time that registration was undertaken, Lord Milner stated emphatically that it was a measure once for all, and that it would form a complete title to residence by those who held such registration certificates.
('6', 37, 1, 7, 65238) Is all this now to be undone?
('6', 37, 1, 8, 65268) Your Lordship is doubtless aware of the Punia case 1, wherein a poor Indian woman, in company with her husband, was torn away from her husband, and was ordered by the magistrate to leave the country within seven hours.
('6', 37, 1, 9, 65487) Fortunately, relief was granted in the end, as the matter was taken up in time.
('6', 37, 1, 10, 65567) A boy under 11 years was also arrested and sentenced to pay a fine of 50 or to go to gaol for three months, and at the end of it to leave the country.
('6', 37, 1, 11, 65718) In this case again the Supreme Court has been able to grant justice.
('6', 37, 1, 12, 65787) The conviction was pronounced to be wholly bad, and Sir James Rose Innes stated that the Administration would bring itself to ridicule and contempt if such a policy was pursued.
('6', 37, 1, 13, 65965) 2 If the existing legislation is strong enough and severe enough to thus prosecute British Indians, is it not enough to keep out of the Colony British Indians who may attempt fraudulently to enter it?
('6', 37, 2, 14, 66166) It has been stated that the reason for passing the Ordinance is that there is an unauthorized influx of British Indians into the Transvaal on a wholesale scale, and that there is an attempt on the part of the Indian community to introduce Indians in such a manner.
('6', 37, 2, 15, 66431) The last charge has been, times without number, repudiated by the Indian community, and the makers of the charge have been challenged to prove their statement.
('6', 37, 2, 16, 66591) The first statement has also been denied.
('6', 37, 3, 17, 66633) I ought to mention one thing also, that is, the fourth resolution that was passed at the British Indian mass meeting.
('6', 37, 3, 18, 66751) 3 It was passed by the meeting solemnly, prayerfully, and in all humility, and the whole of that great meeting decided by that resolution that, if this Ordinance
('6', 37, 4, 19, 66913) 1 Vide The Punia Case, 29 9 1906. 2 ibid 3 ibid
('6', 38, 0, 1, 66961) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 39
('6', 38, 1, 2, 67004) ever came to be enforced, and we did not get relief, the British Indians, rather than submit to the great degradation involved in it, would go to gaol; such was the intensity of the feeling aroused by the Ordinance.
('6', 38, 1, 3, 67220) We have hitherto suffered much in the Transvaal and in other parts of South Africa, but the hardship has been tolerable; we have not considered it necessary to travel 6,000 miles to place the position before the Imperial Government.
('6', 38, 1, 4, 67453) But the straining point has been reached by the Ordinance, and we felt that we should in all humility exhaust every resource even to the extent of sending a Deputation to wait on your Lordship.
('6', 38, 2, 5, 67647) The least, therefore, that in my humble opinion is due to the British Indian community is to appoint a commission as suggested in the humble representation submitted to your Lordship.
('6', 38, 2, 6, 67831) It is a time honoured British custom that, whenever an important principle is involved, a commission is appointed before a step is taken.
('6', 38, 2, 7, 67969) The question of alien immigration into the United Kingdom is a parallel case.
('6', 38, 2, 8, 68047) Charges somewhat similar to the charges against the Indian community were made against the aliens who entered the United Kingdom.
('6', 38, 2, 9, 68177) There was also the question of the adequacy of the existing legislation and the necessity for further legislation; all these three points were referred to a commission before any step was taken.
('6', 38, 2, 10, 68372) I, therefore, venture to think that a commission should be appointed, and the whole question thrashed out before any drastic measures are taken.
('6', 38, 2, 11, 68517) I venture, therefore, to hope that your Lordship will see your way to grant this small measure of relief to the British Indian community.
('6', 38, 3, 12, 68655) MR. H. O. ALLY: My Lord, we are very much obliged to you for the patient hearing your Lordship is giving to the deputation.
('6', 38, 3, 13, 68779) Mr. Gandhi has stated the case fully before your Lordship, and I do not wish to add much to what has already been said.
('6', 38, 3, 14, 68899) I am not a lawyer, but as a layman, and as a resident of old standing in the Transvaal, I do wish to submit to your Lordship that the hardships that the present Ordinance would inflict upon us are unbearable.
('6', 38, 3, 15, 69108) And I can assure your Lordship that, immediately the Ordinance was introduced into the Legislative Council of the Transvaal, my fellow countrymen felt, and felt very keenly, to think that such laws can be passed under a British Government.
('6', 38, 3, 16, 69348) It is what I should never have believed years ago.
('6', 38, 4, 17, 69399) Our lot is today infinitely worse than under the Boer regime; we were able to
('6', 39, 0, 1, 69477) 40 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 39, 1, 2, 69518) get protection from the British Government during that time.
('6', 39, 1, 3, 69579) Are we now, under the same Government, to be persecuted?
('6', 39, 2, 4, 69636) When aliens of all classes are, at the very moment that the Ordinance is introduced, pouring into the Transvaal, and when they enjoy all the rights and privileges granted to British subjects, my countrymen, who are always to the fore for the defence of the Empire, are suffering these serious disabilities and the disabilities threatened by the Ordinance.
('6', 39, 2, 5, 69992) Today in India the frontier is guarded by my fellow countrymen, who shoulder the rifle in defence of the Empire; and it is very grievous that they should have to suffer such misery, and that there should be class legislation against them of this type.
('6', 39, 3, 6, 70244) I appeal for justice, and I appeal to your Lordship in the name of the British
('6', 39, 4, 7, 70323) traditions, that you will be pleased to remove the disability that the Ordinance will
('6', 39, 5, 8, 70409) place upon us, by vetoing it, or at least by granting a commission.
('6', 39, 5, 9, 70477) We are loyal
('6', 39, 6, 10, 70490) British subjects, and as such we are entitled to the fullest protection.
('6', 39, 6, 11, 70563) We have not
('6', 39, 7, 12, 70575) asked for, and we do not now ask for, political rights: we are content that the white
('6', 39, 8, 13, 70661) man should be predominant in the Transvaal; but we do feel that we are entitled to all
('6', 39, 9, 14, 70748) the other ordinary rights that a British subject should enjoy.
('6', 39, 10, 15, 70811) SIR HENRY COTTON: I wish to say one word, my Lord, if I may.
('6', 39, 10, 16, 70872) I am here not only as a retired Indian official, like many distinguished men I see around me, but also as a Member of the present Parliament, and as chairman of a meeting which sat in the Grand Committee Room upstairs in the House of Commons attended by more than 100 members of the Liberal Party.
('6', 39, 10, 17, 71170) I take this opportunity of saying that I deeply regret that the invitations to attend that meeting were not extended to both sides of the House.
('6', 39, 10, 18, 71315) Hear!) It was an unfortunate oversight which we all regret.
('6', 39, 10, 19, 71375) But that meeting, I say, was attended by 100 and more Members of the House of Commons, and their feeling was very strong indeed upon this subject; indeed, they went so far as to record a resolution that they sympathized with and supported the prayer of the petitioners.
('6', 39, 10, 20, 71645) Since that meeting, my Lord, I have been brought in contact with many Members of the House of Commons who were not present at the meeting, gentlemen on both sides of the House.
('6', 39, 10, 21, 71822) Many gentlemen on the opposite benches have also intimated to me that there is a complete sympathy with the attitude taken up by Messrs Gandhi and Ally on behalf of their fellow subjects in the Transvaal.
('6', 39, 11, 22, 72027) I wish also in associating myself, as I do completely, with the observations which fell from Sir Lepel Griffin, to remind your Lordship that it was Lord Lansdowne, for whom we all have the greatest regard and respect, who, although he is the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords, is at all events, as we know very well, a most liberal minded statesman, who drew prominent attention in England to
('6', 40, 0, 1, 72433) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 41
('6', 40, 1, 2, 72476) the grievances which the British Indians in the Transvaal suffered from under President Krugers administration.
('6', 40, 1, 3, 72588) Nothing, he said, roused so much indignation in his mind or so much anger as the ill treatment which the British Indians received in South Africa.
('6', 40, 1, 4, 72735) And he went further even in his speechit was a speech delivered at Sheffield two or three weeks after the outbreak of the warfor he said that he regarded with grave anxiety the state of feeling which must inevitably exist in India when it was known that the British subjects of India in South Africa were so ill treated and ground down.
('6', 40, 1, 5, 73072) And he pointed out the imperative duty of the British Government to improve their status and position.
('6', 40, 2, 6, 73175) Now, my Lord, that is a pledge which was given by the head of the Opposition
('6', 40, 3, 7, 73252) in the House of Lords, and I appeal to you, my Lord, as the representative of a Liberal
('6', 40, 4, 8, 73340) Government, in dealing with this matter in South Africa, that your duty is at least as
('6', 40, 5, 9, 73427) decisive as [that] Lord Lansdowne claimed for himself a few years ago.
('6', 40, 6, 10, 73498) It is true that the people of India do feel this matter very deeply.
('6', 40, 6, 11, 73567) It is true also that the British Indians in South Africa have greater grievances to complain of now than they had under the Dutch Government; and the climax has been reached in the passing of this Ordinance, of which Messrs Gandhi and Ally here so justly complain.
('6', 40, 6, 12, 73832) Representing as I do a very influential and large section of the House of Commons and, I believe, the almost unanimous official feeling in India on the subject, I do trust that your Lordship will be able to give this petition your favourable consideration.
('6', 40, 7, 13, 74089) SIR M. M. BHOWNAGGREE: My Lord, I think the case has been so ably and
('6', 40, 8, 14, 74159) clearly put before your Lordship that there is not the least occasion for me to go into
('6', 40, 9, 15, 74247) any details, and if I feel called upon to address your Lordship for a very few minutes, it
('6', 40, 10, 16, 74338) is simply on account of the interest I took in this question all through my ten and a
('6', 40, 11, 17, 74424) half years career in Parliament.
('6', 40, 11, 18, 74457) I want to bring to your Lordships notice a few points
('6', 40, 12, 19, 74511) which perhaps may not be within your knowledge.
('6', 40, 13, 20, 74559) In complaining of the grievances of British Indian subject in South Africa, I had opportunities of seeing your predecessors, Mr. Chamberlain and Mr. Lyttelton, very often on the subject.
('6', 40, 13, 21, 74746) My activity had taken the form at last of a long printed letter in which I detailed the whole narrative of the facts, and Mr. Lyttelton thereupon assured me that the case had been so fairly put, and the demands made were so reasonable, that he hoped to get some relief.
('6', 40, 13, 22, 75016) I, on the other hand, knew what the local forces of opposition to a liberal policy on the part of any ministry of the Imperial Government would be, and while I thanked him for his sympathetic answer, I told him it might be necessary to appoint a commission to enquire into the whole subject.
('6', 40, 13, 23, 75308) Sir George Farrar, who represented the anti British Indian interest[s] in the Transvaal legislature, also happened at the same time, to suggest that the appointment of a
('6', 41, 0, 1, 75478) 42 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 41, 1, 2, 75519) commission would ventilate the matter, and might bring some solution of that very difficult problem.
('6', 41, 1, 3, 75620) Thereupon I addressed Mr. Lyttelton again, accepting Sir George Farrars offer, and matters were in that train, and I believe Mr. Lyttelton would have ultimately appointed a commission, but the Government, of which he was a member then, went out of office.
('6', 41, 1, 4, 75876) Recognizing the very difficult position in which the whole question stands, I now urge that a commission might be appointed pending the report of which this Ordinance might at least be held in abeyance, so that you may have the benefit of judging of the whole question by the report of that commission.
('6', 41, 2, 5, 76179) I have only one word to add, my Lord.
('6', 41, 2, 6, 76217) For five years your Lordship has been
('6', 41, 3, 7, 76255) the custodian and guardian of Indian interests and the protector of their rights, during
('6', 41, 4, 8, 76344) a memorable and distinguished viceroyalty.
('6', 41, 4, 9, 76387) Todayas our leader, Sir Lepel Griffin,
('6', 41, 5, 10, 76426) has well saidthe eyes of all India are focused upon the proceedings which are taking
('6', 41, 6, 11, 76511) place in this room, and I am only expressing the sentiments of the 300 millions of
('6', 41, 7, 12, 76594) people of India when I express the hope that your Lordship will, on account of the
('6', 41, 8, 13, 76677) sympathy which you have shown, and which I believe you are ready to show, and of
('6', 41, 9, 14, 76758) which, even on our entrance into this room, you assured us, allow no other
('6', 41, 10, 15, 76833) consideration but that of justice to weigh with you, and will grant the prayer which
('6', 41, 11, 16, 76918) these gentlemen have come all this long distance here to ask at your hands.
('6', 41, 12, 17, 76994) MR. REES: I am not going, my Lord, into the subject of the merits of the case; I
('6', 41, 13, 18, 77075) think they were amply dealt with by Sir Lepel Griffin; nor am I going to speak of my
('6', 41, 14, 19, 77160) interest in this subject, which I have often brought before Parliament myself.
('6', 41, 15, 20, 77239) when Sir Henry Cotton spoke of the meeting yesterday, I should like to say that it
('6', 41, 16, 21, 77322) was not only a party meeting, but it was a meeting of part of a party, and that I do
('6', 41, 17, 22, 77407) deprecate with all my heart and soul, in a matter which is of such serious importance,
('6', 41, 18, 23, 77494) any endeavour to make any subject connected with British India a party subject.
('6', 41, 19, 24, 77574) not think there can be a more serious matter than this very serious one upon which we
('6', 41, 20, 25, 77660) have come before your Lordship, namely, the unfortunate manner in which our fellow 
('6', 41, 21, 26, 77744) subjects have been treated in the Transvaal.
('6', 41, 22, 27, 77789) MR. HAROLD COX: My Lord, I am in a somewhat different position from most of the gentlemen here, because I am neither an ex official of the Government of India, nor am I myself Indian by birth, but I did have the honour personally of serving in India for two years under a Native Prince, and I look back to that period of my life with the greatest pleasure.
('6', 41, 22, 28, 78146) That is one special reason why I am here today.
('6', 41, 22, 29, 78194) But at the back of my mind the real reason why I am here today is because I am English, and because I think this matter is a disgrace to my country.
('6', 41, 22, 30, 78343) Our country was pledged when we went to war with the Transvaal to do justice to the British Indians.
('6', 41, 22, 31, 78444) That justice has not been done, and I contend that it is not possible for the present Government, of
('6', 42, 0, 1, 78545) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 43
('6', 42, 1, 2, 78588) which your Lordship is a part, to ride off on the plea that the Transvaal is a self governing Colony.
('6', 42, 1, 3, 78690) It is not a self governing Colony.
('6', 42, 1, 4, 78725) It is absolutely subject to your authority, and whatever is done by you today, or at any other time, is done not in the name of the Transvaal, but in the name of the English people, and in the name of the English people I protest against any injustice being done to British subjects.
('6', 42, 2, 5, 79009) MR. NAOROJI: I do not want to take up your Lordships time, and after the able manner in which the whole subject has been laid before you, I would only join in the appeal that has been made to you on behalf of my fellow subjects under the British flag.
('6', 42, 2, 6, 79261) If there is one principle more important than another, it is that of the freedom of British subjects under the British flag, and I do hope that the British Government, especially a Liberal Government, will stand upon that basis.
('6', 42, 3, 7, 79490) MR. AMEER ALI: Will your Lordship allow me to make one observation only?
('6', 42, 3, 8, 79563) Perhaps my recent experience of India is the most recent of all.
('6', 42, 3, 9, 79628) I venture to say this: that the feeling of India is very strong on this subject of the injury done to British Indians in the Transvaal, and it will be a serious mistake if the subject is put on one side.
('6', 42, 3, 10, 79832) That is the only matter I want to present to your Lordship.
('6', 42, 4, 11, 79892) THE EARL OF ELGIN: In the first place, I would like to say that I entirely accept the position which Mr. Cox put upon me.
('6', 42, 4, 12, 80014) I am responsible, no doubt, for the advice which is given in this matter and nobody else, and I do not wish to shirk my responsibility.
('6', 42, 4, 13, 80150) In the second case, I wish also to express my adherence to what was said by Mr. Rees, Sir Henry Cotton and others that I regard this as no party question at all.
('6', 42, 4, 14, 80312) Sir Henry Cotton quoted from Lord Lansdowne, but I have before me a despatch from the Colonial Secretary of the last Government from which I should like to read one paragraph: His Majesty's Government cannot believe that the British community in the Transvaal appreciate the true nature of the proposition which some of its members are pressing upon you.
('6', 42, 4, 15, 80667) They, as Britons, are as jealous of the honour of the British name as ourselves, and even if a material sacrifice were necessary to vindicate that honour, I feel assured they would cheerfully make it.
('6', 42, 4, 16, 80868) His Majesty's Government hold that it is derogatory to national honour to impose on resident British subjects disabilities against which we had remonstrated, and to which even the law of the late South African Republic rightly interpreted did not subject them, and they do not doubt that when this is perceived the public opinion of the Colony will not any longer support the demand which has been put forward.
('6', 42, 5, 17, 81279) SIR HENRY COTTON: May I ask which Colonial Secretary that was?
('6', 42, 6, 18, 81342) THE EARL OF ELGIN: It was from Mr. Lyttelton to yourself, written in 1904. Now, I understand from the gentlemen who have come before me today that we are not here to discuss general sympathies, nor even are we to consider anything further than the rights which the British Indian community possessed in the past.
('6', 42, 6, 19, 81655) They do not ask
('6', 43, 0, 1, 81671) 44 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 43, 1, 2, 81712) at this present moment for an extension of those rights.
('6', 43, 1, 3, 81769) That limits the matter, as I think you wish it to be limited, to the question of this Ordinance itself.
('6', 43, 2, 4, 81873) SIR LEPEL GRIFFIN: For the present, my Lord.
('6', 43, 2, 5, 81918) We are going to fight the question hereafter.
('6', 43, 3, 6, 81964) THE EARL OF ELGIN: Oh, yes; I am thinking of today, and the answer I have to give.
('6', 43, 4, 7, 82047) SIR LEPEL GRIFFIN: Yes.
('6', 43, 5, 8, 82071) THE EARL OF ELGIN: I only make that observation in order that I may be precise in my answer.
('6', 43, 5, 9, 82164) The question, therefore, is with reference to this Ordinance, and following up the remark I made just now about its being no party question, I hope you will accept it from me that it was no intention of the men at the head of the Transvaal Governmentthey distinctly stated so to methat they had no intention whatever in the legislation they brought forward to do otherwise than to improve, rather than to make worse, the condition of the British Indian community.
('6', 43, 5, 10, 82628) I am not saying that the subject is not perfectly open to your criticisms, but I wish you to accept from me that that was the intention with which this legislation was brought forward.
('6', 43, 5, 11, 82813) Now Mr. Gandhi explained that, in some cases, for instance in the case of the poll tax, this concession, which was supposed to be given under the Ordinance, was illusory.
('6', 43, 5, 12, 82984) I admit that I think there was something in his statement that most of those who would come under the restriction I have just mentioned would probably have paid the 3. But at the same time, dealing with this as a matter of the status of the British Indians in the Transvaal, I conceive that the Government might quite fairly have held that in removing the imposition of the poll tax once for all they were, pro tanto, improving the status of the British Indians.
('6', 43, 6, 13, 83447) Then with regard to the question of permits or registration, we have seen one of the permits given under the Boer administration.
('6', 43, 6, 14, 83577) It is merely a receipt for the money.
('6', 43, 6, 15, 83615) The Boer administration in that respect, as well as in a good many others, was not so accurate as the administration which necessarily with our ideas obtains under the British Government; and, therefore, I am only stating the view which has been put before me; the view of the Government of the Transvaal is this: that as it stood under the rules of the Boer Government which they had inherited, there was great confusion, and there were great administrative difficulties, and that consequently there was a considerable degree of friction, and also there arose considerable delay in the determination of cases of which 1 see traces in the petition itself.
('6', 43, 6, 16, 84271) It was for that purpose, as I understand it, that the Government of the Transvaal proposed to substitute the form of registration, but according to their representations to me, there was no intention whatever of making that form of registration in any way more oppressive than the form of permits properly ministered.
('6', 44, 0, 1, 84589) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 45
('6', 44, 1, 2, 84632) And if I may, just for a momentI do not want to go into all the details follow this question of thumb marks, I think that thumb marks first came into notice prominently when Sir Henry Cotton and I were associated in the Government of India, under our friend Mr. Henry, who occupies a prominent position in the city now.
('6', 44, 1, 3, 84952) No doubt the imposition of thumb marks was introduced in that case for the detection of criminals, but I do not know why the imposition of a thumb mark in itself should be a very debasing operation; in fact, as they say, it has always seemed to me a most marvellous thing that they say whey can trace every thumb mark, there might be an advantage over the hieroglyphics which some of us call our signatures.
('6', 44, 1, 4, 85360) And there is this fact I want just to mention, and to bring to the notice of Mr. Gandhi, that on the permit which he has handed to me, issued under the present Ordinance, there is a thumb mark already imposed under the present Ordinance in just the same way as it will be imposed under the new Ordinance.
('6', 44, 2, 5, 85665) MR. GANDHI: Only that that, as I said, is a purely voluntary act done by us on the advice and the instigation of Lord Milner.
('6', 44, 2, 6, 85791) He asked us to do it.
('6', 44, 3, 7, 85813) THE EARL OF ELGIN: Quite so; but still here is a certificate which is an official certificate, and it bears a thumb mark.
('6', 44, 4, 8, 85935) LORD STANLEY OF ALDERLEY: It was affixed without prejudice.
('6', 44, 5, 9, 85995) THE EARL OF ELGIN: I do not see why it should not be affixed to the registration certificate without prejudice.
('6', 44, 6, 10, 86107) SIR M. BHOWNAGGREE: Might I explain one thing?
('6', 44, 6, 11, 86154) Whatever Lord Milner asked British Indians to do was done on the understanding that the whole question of the treatment of the community was the subject of consideration between the Colonial Secretary for the time being and Lord Milner and the local authorities, so that they might have submitted to Lord Milners injunction in a respectful way and, as Lord Stanley just now said, without prejudice.
('6', 44, 6, 12, 86553) But this imposes a sort of distinction between one subject and another in the Transvaal.
('6', 44, 7, 13, 86642) THE EARL OF ELGIN:: Do not suppose I am taking it further than this; I am only saying here is a document which is at present in use with a thumb mark, and it cannot be called debasing.
('6', 44, 8, 14, 86827) MR. GANDHI: It is the ten finger mark.
('6', 44, 9, 15, 86866) THE EARL OF ELGIN:: Is it more debasing with ten fingers?
('6', 44, 10, 16, 86924) SIR HENRY COTTON: It is only required in the case of criminals.
('6', 44, 11, 17, 86988) THE EARL OF ELGIN:: I do not want to argue it, but I think there is just that much to be said.
('6', 44, 12, 18, 87083) Then there is one matter about registration; that is, that if the system of
('6', 45, 0, 1, 87159) 46 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 45, 1, 2, 87200) registration was carried out it would give a final and indefeasible title to those who are registered to their rights in the Transvaal.
('6', 45, 1, 3, 87336) That is the position of the Transvaal Government on that matter.
('6', 45, 1, 4, 87401) And as regards the carrying of a pass, and any oppressive use of the power of inspection, I am informed, and I have taken some trouble to ascertain it, that all that would be intended, so far as checking the Ordinance certificate is concerned, is that it would probably be inspected once a year.
('6', 45, 1, 5, 87697) As regards any other casual demand for it, it would be, as I am told, exactly in the same position as this permit is, which, if I am right, may be demanded from anybody in the Transvaal.
('6', 45, 1, 6, 87884) This is the position.
('6', 45, 1, 7, 87906) I do not want to elaborate too much on this subject, I only wish to make this explanation, that those were the sort of reasons which the Government of the Transvaal put before me when they asked my assent to the introduction of the legislation on these grounds, and it is distinctly upon my apprehension that these modifications of the law would, in the long run, be for the benefit, and not for the oppression, of the British Indian community that I gave my assent to the introduction of that legislation.
('6', 45, 2, 8, 88413) Now, gentlemen, we are in the position that this is challenged.
('6', 45, 2, 9, 88477) I think I ought
('6', 45, 3, 10, 88493) to say, without in any way challenging the authority with which Mr. Gandhi and Mr.
('6', 45, 4, 11, 88576) Ally come here as the representatives of a large meeting, that I have got telegrams
('6', 45, 5, 12, 88660) from the Transvaal advising me of the forwarding of a petition from British Indians
('6', 45, 6, 13, 88744) which they say had been largely signed, in opposition to the views which have been
('6', 45, 7, 14, 88827) placed before me today; and with regard to the general feeling I have today received
('6', 45, 8, 15, 88912) two more telegrams, I say two more, because there are a good many others from
('6', 45, 9, 16, 88990) different municipalities in the country urging the passing of the Ordinance and so on.
('6', 45, 10, 17, 89077) I cannot, therefore, entirely subscribe to what Sir Lepel Griffin said about the
('6', 45, 11, 18, 89158) opposition, and the nature of the opposition to this matter.
('6', 45, 11, 19, 89219) I regret it more than
('6', 45, 12, 20, 89241) anybody in this room.
('6', 45, 12, 21, 89263) I suppose there could be found, if not in the records of this
('6', 45, 13, 22, 89325) office, at any rate, in the records of the India Office, despatches with my signature
('6', 45, 14, 23, 89411) attached to them, protesting, in as strong language as has been used here, against the
('6', 45, 15, 24, 89498) restrictions on British citizens, and I do not go back from one single word.
('6', 45, 16, 25, 89575) have to recognize the fact that all over the world there are difficulties arising on the
('6', 45, 17, 26, 89664) part of white communities, and we have to reckon with them.
('6', 45, 17, 27, 89724) I do not say that they
('6', 45, 18, 28, 89747) ought always to succeed; they certainly ought not to succeed in points of detail which
('6', 45, 19, 29, 89834) would, in any way, involve oppression.
('6', 45, 19, 30, 89873) But the fact of there being that sentiment has
('6', 45, 20, 31, 89920) to be borne in mind when we have to deal with matters of this description.
('6', 45, 21, 32, 89995) I do not think I have much more to reply to.
('6', 45, 21, 33, 90040) Reference has been made to the proposition towards the end of the petition, that at any rate there might be a postponement for the examination of the subject by a commission.
('6', 45, 21, 34, 90215) That, no doubt, is an alternative which might be adopted; but I am not in a position today to say
('6', 46, 0, 1, 90313) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 47
('6', 46, 1, 2, 90356) whether that is so or not.
('6', 46, 1, 3, 90383) Indeed I think you will easily acknowledge that I paid you the best compliment when I did not endeavour to make up my mind until I had seen you, and heard what you have to say.
('6', 46, 1, 4, 90560) That is my position.
('6', 46, 1, 5, 90581) I have now heard what Mr. Gandhi had to say.
('6', 46, 1, 6, 90626) I hope he has put before me, as fully as he desired, what he has come so far to say.
('6', 46, 1, 7, 90711) I have heard the other gentlemen who have accompanied him.
('6', 46, 1, 8, 90770) I will give the best consideration to their representations, and I shall think it my duty to make up my mind with the full responsibility which I have to assume.
('6', 46, 2, 9, 90932) MR. GANDHI: May I make one statement, my Lord, for one minute?
('6', 46, 2, 10, 90995) I have listened with the very greatest attention, and with very great obligation, to your Lordships statement, but I must submit that the information placed before your Lordship on some points is not accurate, and I am in a position to refute that information by documentary evidence with regard to permits, as your Lordship used the term, in connection with the Ordinance of 1885, but this is not the occasion when I could do it.
('6', 46, 2, 11, 91426) But if your Lordship will ask us to wait upon you we: will do it.
('6', 46, 2, 12, 91492) But that just shows that nothing short of a commission would place our position accurately before your Lordship.
('6', 46, 3, 13, 91605) SIR LEPEL GRIFFIN: My Lord, I beg, on behalf of the deputation, to express our best thanks for the exceedingly kind and courteous way in which you have received us, and the patience with which you have listened to what we had to say.
('6', 46, 3, 14, 91839) We were assured before of your full sympathy in this matter, and knew it perfectly well.
('6', 46, 4, 15, 91928) (The deputation then withdrew.)

('6', 46, 8, 19, 92139) TO THE PRIVATE SECRETARY TO THE RIGHT HONBLE THE EARL OF ELGIN HIS MAJESTYS PRINCIPAL SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES COLONIAL OFFICE LONDON
('6', 46, 10, 20, 92284) With reference to the interview that Lord Elgin was pleased to grant us, we beg to enquire whether His Lordship will be pleased to
('6', 47, 0, 1, 92415) 48 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 47, 1, 2, 92456) acquaint us with the nature of the cablegram 1 of dissent received from some Indians in the Transvaal by His Lordship, as also with the names of the senders 2. The information is of a somewhat startling nature and we might, if some further information were given to us, be able to render an explanation.
('6', 47, 1, 3, 92760) The Deputation this afternoon was intended more to strengthen His Lordships hands in securing for the British Indians in the Transvaal fair and just treatment rather than to place before His Lordship a full statement.
('6', 47, 1, 4, 92978) As we believe that some of the information received by His Lordship and used by him in his statement is not consistent withthe facts, may we request a brief private interview at which it will be possible for us to place the details more fully before him than we could at the Deputation that took place this afternoon.
('6', 47, 2, 5, 93296) We have the honour to remain,
('6', 47, 4, 6, 93326) Your obedient servants, M. K. GANDHI H. O. ALLY

('6', 47, 7, 10, 93532) [HOTEL CECIL, LONDON,] November 8, 1906
('6', 47, 8, 11, 93572) DEAR MADAM,
('6', 47, 9, 12, 93584) I thank you for your note.

('6', 47, 9, 14, 93706) I fear it will be impossible for us to stay here up to January much as we should like to be able to address a meeting in Liverpool.
('6', 47, 9, 15, 93838) We are likely to leave, at the latest, on the 24th instant.
('6', 47, 9, 16, 93898) I suppose, therefore, that the idea of a meeting in Liverpool must be dropped.

('6', 48, 8, 12, 94519) I am sending this letter on the off chance of its reaching you.
('6', 48, 8, 13, 94583) If you receive it you will be surprised to know that I am in London.
('6', 48, 8, 14, 94652) As my departure from Johannesburg was very hurried I forgot to take your address with me.
('6', 48, 8, 15, 94742) I asked my clerk to send it, but have not yet received it.
('6', 48, 8, 16, 94801) I shall be exceedingly sorry if I have to leave London without seeing you.

('6', 50, 2, 3, 96016) HOTEL CECIL, LONDON, November 8, 1906
('6', 50, 3, 4, 96054) SIR, We venture to address this informal letter to you on the strength of your having always been a friend of the Coloured people, using the term in its widest sense.
('6', 50, 3, 5, 96221) Lord Elgin seemed to think, as you also thought, that a commission of enquiry was due to us.
('6', 50, 3, 6, 96314) We venture respectfully to think that a word of approval from you of the idea of a commission would bring about, from our point of view, the desired result.
('6', 50, 3, 7, 96471) The Ordinance proceeds on the assumption that every Indian is capable of abusing his permit or registration.
('6', 50, 3, 8, 96580) From the statement made by Lord Elgin there is, in our humble opinion, no doubt that a great deal of inaccurate information has been placed before him.
('6', 50, 3, 9, 96732) We think that nothing short of an impartial commission of enquiry can remove all the doubts and misapprehension that exist.
('6', 50, 3, 10, 96856) May we appeal to you again for this small measure of justice, which it is in your power to grant.

('6', 51, 1, 3, 97450) Messrs Bell and Nixon have probably written to you in the matter.
('6', 51, 1, 4, 97516) It was agreed between them and me that evidence should be taken of Mr. Dalglish, during my stay in London, before a commiss ioner to be appointed by us by mutual agreement between us.
('6', 51, 1, 5, 97700) I shall be obliged if you will kindly let me know whether evidence can be taken some time next week as I am likely to leave London if not Saturday week, certainly on the Saturday following.

('6', 52, 5, 10, 99061) I shall thank you to hurry forward the matter.
('6', 52, 5, 11, 99108) There was a very satisfactory interview with Lord Elgin; he was desirous that it should be kept private.
('6', 52, 5, 12, 99213) I think that if sufficient effort is now made, relief will be granted.

('6', 53, 7, 8, 100286) DEAR SIR MUNCHERJI,
('6', 53, 8, 9, 100306) I do not overstate when I say that probably you will be responsible if some measure of success is gained by the Deputation.
('6', 53, 8, 10, 100430) Immediately Mr. Ally and I went to Sir Lepel Griffin, he told us he had received your note and that he entirely agreed with you that the Deputation should wait on Mr. Morley.
('6', 53, 8, 11, 100605) 1 He was most sympathetic and enthusiastic and this is no doubt due to you.
('6', 53, 8, 12, 100681) I are now sending [a letter 2] to ask an appointment with Mr. Morley.
('6', 53, 8, 13, 100751) Mr. Ally and I had half an hour with Lord George Hamilton who was sympathetic but there was a ring of non possumus about all he said.
('6', 53, 8, 14, 100885) However, he has told us that he will carefully go through the Ordinance.

('6', 54, 5, 5, 101436) We, the undersigned, being Delegates appointed by the British Indian Association of the Transvaal to wait upon the Imperial authorities in connection with the Asiatic Law Amendment Ordinance passed by the Legislative Council, beg to report that we have waited upon His Majestys Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies and now request an interview with the Right Honble the Secretary for India.
('6', 54, 5, 6, 101836) Mr. Morley, in his communication to Mr. Naoroji, was pleased to say that he would receive the Indian Deputation, for which we beg to express our thanks.
('6', 54, 5, 7, 101989) Sir Lepel Griffin, who headed, and other distinguished gentlemen who formed the deputation yesterday, have kindly consented to join us and introduce us to Mr. Morley.

('6', 55, 12, 13, 102876) LONDON,] November 9, 1906
('6', 55, 13, 14, 102902) DEAR MR. POLAK,
('6', 55, 14, 15, 102918) I am sending you all the cuttings I can.
('6', 55, 14, 16, 102959) I will not enumerate them.
('6', 55, 14, 17, 102986) The interview with Lord Elgin yesterday was exceedingly good.
('6', 55, 14, 18, 103048) Sir Lepel Griffin spoke very nicely.
('6', 55, 14, 19, 103085) You may read this letter to the members of the Association.
('6', 55, 14, 20, 103145) I may be able to let you have the official copy of the proceedings next week.
('6', 55, 14, 21, 103223) I have applied for it.
('6', 55, 14, 22, 103246) Sir Muncherji, Mr. Naoroji, Mr. Ameer Ali and Mr. Rees spoke; they were all precise and to the point.
('6', 55, 14, 23, 103348) The support we have received is beyond expectation.
('6', 55, 14, 24, 103400) Everybody considers that a stronger deputation on Indian affairs has never yet waited upon the Government.
('6', 55, 14, 25, 103507) There seems to be every reason for hoping that Lord Elgin will grant a commission and if he does, it will be exceedingly good.
('6', 55, 14, 26, 103634) We have now asked for an interview with Mr. Morley; that Deputation will also, I believe, be very

('6', 56, 1, 2, 103775) strongly supported The meeting of the Members of the House of Commons 1 was very enthusiastic and sympathetic.
('6', 56, 1, 3, 103886) Some of the Members thought that it was unprecedented !
('6', 56, 1, 4, 103942) Nobody had expected that over 100 Members would attend.
('6', 56, 1, 5, 103998) The speakers too at the meeting vied with one another in showing their sympathy.
('6', 56, 1, 6, 104079) We saw Lord George Hamilton today: he gave us half an hour.
('6', 56, 1, 7, 104139) He said he felt convinced that an injustice was being done.
('6', 56, 1, 8, 104199) He has promised to study the Representation to Lord Elgin.
('6', 56, 1, 9, 104258) There was, however, an attitude of non possumus about him.
('6', 56, 1, 10, 104317) We sent you a long cablegram 2 yesterday.
('6', 56, 1, 11, 104359) The more we see, the more we feel that a permanent committee is absolutely necessary, if the work of the Deputation is not to be frittered away.
('6', 56, 1, 12, 104504) Sir Muncherji is very emphatic on the point.
('6', 56, 1, 13, 104549) It is, therefore, vexing that no cablegram has yet been received from you.
('6', 56, 1, 14, 104624) This is not to blame you.
('6', 56, 1, 15, 104650) I can quite understand the difficulties you are going through.
('6', 56, 1, 16, 104713) This is not to blame you.
('6', 56, 1, 17, 104739) 3 I simply state the fact that delay is dangerous and hope that tomorrow there will be a cablegram from you.
('6', 56, 1, 18, 104848) I need hardly say that Mr. Ally is in thorough agreement with this view.
('6', 56, 1, 19, 104921) We are both getting on very nicely.
('6', 56, 1, 20, 104957) You will be pleased to learn that Mr. Scott, your fathers friend, played an important part in bringing about the meeting of the Members of the House of Commons and that your father devoted the best part of last Monday to seeing Mr. Scott and others for this meeting.
('6', 56, 1, 21, 105224) His assistance to me has been very valuable in more ways than one.
('6', 56, 1, 22, 105291) Your mother has promised to try earth bandages for her neuralgia.
('6', 56, 1, 23, 105357) I tried to dig up some clean earth from your yard but it was not to be had.
('6', 56, 1, 24, 105433) Your father was to procure some from elsewhere.
('6', 56, 1, 25, 105481) I shall know more next Sunday as I am to pass almost the whole of Sunday afternoon with your people: having, however, found out Mrs. [Freeths address,] 4 I shall have to take away 2 hours from them.
('6', 56, 1, 26, 105680) I am not sending any article this time; I may write something if the spirit moves me.
('6', 56, 1, 27, 105766) My outside activity has been so great that there has not been much time left for contemplation: anything, therefore, that I should give you would be purely superficial.

('6', 56, 4, 31, 106036) 3 The repetition of this sentence is due perhaps to an oversight.

('6', 57, 1, 2, 106268) give an article on the papers regarding the activity of the Deputation which I am sending.
('6', 57, 1, 3, 106359) Mr. Mukerji will send you some cuttings and you may deal with the Representation by Godfrey and others, as also the House of Commons meeting and the Deputation.
('6', 57, 1, 4, 106520) As I am dictating this, I now fancy that I may give you a leader 1 on Lord Elgins reply to clear away some of the points.
('6', 57, 1, 5, 106642) You should not take anything from this letter about the Deputation to work up an article because the proceedings of the deputation are supposed to be [private] 2. The cablegram sent to Lord Elgin must be shocking!!!
('6', 57, 1, 6, 106858) I suppose it is Dr. Godfrey.
('6', 57, 1, 7, 106887) We have asked Lord Elgin to give us the text of the cablegram and the name of the sender.
('6', 57, 1, 8, 106977) We may then give an explanation.

('6', 57, 6, 14, 107220) DEAR MR. KITCHIN,
('6', 57, 7, 15, 107238) I have purposely delayed replying to your kind note as my movements were so uncertain.
('6', 57, 7, 16, 107325) I shall have much pleasure in dining with you on Wednesday next, and I shall take the train at Charing Cross at 6.45 p.m.
('6', 57, 7, 17, 107447) If it is not inconvenient to you, we might meet at the station about that time.
('6', 57, 7, 18, 107527) I have not looked at a guide but I take it that it is the

('6', 58, 12, 17, 108467) HOTEL CECIL, LONDON, November 9, 1906
('6', 58, 13, 18, 108505) MY DEAR OLDFIELD,
('6', 58, 14, 19, 108523) Mr. Simmonds attended yesterday to take down the article 1 you were to have dictated.
('6', 58, 14, 20, 108609) I suppose that you were unavoidably detained.
('6', 58, 15, 21, 108655) 1 Dr. Oldfield wrote two articles on Indian Parents' Duty for Indian Opinion, which were published on January 5 and January 12, 1907.

('6', 59, 1, 2, 108830) I had hoped to be able to undergo the operation tomorrow and to pass with you from Saturday to Monday.
('6', 59, 1, 3, 108933) I see, however, that I must not do so for the present, things having taken a turn for the better as also for the worse.
('6', 59, 1, 4, 109053) I must keep myself busy in connection with the Deputation work.
('6', 59, 1, 5, 109117) I find that I cannot possibly leave next week.
('6', 59, 1, 6, 109164) I may, therefore, be ready for treatment Saturday week.

('6', 59, 5, 11, 109371) HOTEL CECIL, LONDON, November 9, 1906 1
('6', 59, 6, 12, 109411) INTERVIEW WITH LORD ELGIN
('6', 59, 7, 13, 109437) Though in order of time, the interview with Lord Elgin comes last, I shall deal with it first as it is very important.
('6', 59, 7, 14, 109556) We were accompanied by Sir Lepel Griffin, Lord Stanley of Alderley, Sir Muncherji Bhownaggree, Mr. Dadabhai Naoroji, Mr. Syed Ameer Ali, Mr. Harold Cox, Sir, Henry Cotton, Sir George Birdwood, Mr. J. D. Rees, Mr. Thornton and Mr. F. H. Brown 2. The deputation included members from all the parties.
('6', 59, 7, 15, 109855) 3 It is said that such a [strong] deputation has never before waited on Lord Elgin.
('6', 59, 7, 16, 109939) We all presented ourselves before Lord Elgin at 3 p.m.
('6', 59, 7, 17, 109994) on Thursday 4.
('6', 59, 8, 18, 110009) 1 The last paragraph of this item would suggest that this was completed on or after November 10, 1906; Vide Letter to O. H. A. Johari, 10 11 1906.
('6', 59, 9, 19, 110156) 2 F. H. Brown was not in the list, circulated by Gandhiji, of members who were to wait in deputation on Lord Elgin; vide Deputation to Lord Elgin,8 11 1906.
('6', 59, 10, 20, 110313) 3 The Conservative Party was not represented in the deputation although, according to Sir Henry Cotton the Transvaal Indian Deputation had the complete sympathy of individual Conservative Members; vide Deputation to Lord Elgin, 8 11 1906.
('6', 59, 11, 21, 110552) 4 November 8, 1906
('6', 60, 0, 1, 110571) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 61
('6', 60, 1, 2, 110614) Sir Lepel Griffin made a spirited speech and appealed to Lord Elgin to reject the Ordinance.
('6', 60, 1, 3, 110707) file said that the Ordinance was derogatory to Anglo Indians 1. One who read the Ordinance would think that those who ruled over such people 2 must be a worthless lot.
('6', 60, 1, 4, 110875) The Indians and the British both originated in Central Asia.
('6', 60, 1, 5, 110936) The Indians were very industrious, intelligent and honest.
('6', 60, 1, 6, 110995) Those who had seen India would never tolerate the refuse of Europe collected in the Transvaal tyrannizing over the Indians there.
('6', 60, 1, 7, 111125) Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Ally spoke after Sir Lepel.
('6', 60, 1, 8, 111172) Mr. Allys voice choked with emotion as he spoke.
('6', 60, 2, 9, 111221) Then Sir Henry Cotton made a powerful speech.
('6', 60, 2, 10, 111267) Quoting Lord Lansdowne, he said that the Members of the House of Commons also wanted that justice be done.
('6', 60, 2, 11, 111374) While Kruger used the whip, the British Government were scourging us with scorpion stings.
('6', 60, 2, 12, 111465) Sir Muncherji wanted to know what had happened to the commission which Mr. Lyttelton had promised him.
('6', 60, 2, 13, 111568) If Lord Elgin could do nothing more, the commission at any rate should be appointed.
('6', 60, 2, 14, 111653) Mr. Ameer Ali said that he had recently returned from India and that the whole country was unhappy over the sufferings of Indians in South Africa.
('6', 60, 3, 15, 111800) Mr. Dadabhai said that the British Government would stand disgraced if the oppression of Indians continued.
('6', 60, 4, 16, 111908) Mr. Rees said that this question was an all party one.
('6', 60, 5, 17, 111963) Mr. Cox said that, as an Englishman, he felt ashamed of the disabilities Indians in the Transvaal had to suffer.
('6', 60, 5, 18, 112076) In reply, Lord Elgin said that his own sympathy was bound to be with the Indians.
('6', 60, 5, 19, 112158) He had always wished well of the Indian people.
('6', 60, 5, 20, 112206) The officials of the Transvaal Government had stated that the Ordinance was not oppressive.
('6', 60, 5, 21, 112298) It was true in a sense that the remission of the 3 tax afforded, as Mr. Gandhi had pointed out, no relief in fact.
('6', 60, 5, 22, 112413) However, it was something of a gain that the legal stigma of the 3 tax had been removed.
('6', 60, 5, 23, 112502) There did not seem to be much objection to the giving of thumb impressions.
('6', 60, 5, 24, 112578) It was unlikely that the police would look into the passes every day and harass the people.
('6', 60, 5, 25, 112670) However, there was no need to emphasize all these matters.
('6', 60, 5, 26, 112729) Sir Lepel had said that the
('6', 60, 6, 27, 112757) 1 The British in India were also referred to as Anglo Indians.
('6', 60, 6, 28, 112820) 2 The reference is to the people to whom the Ordinance applied, namely, the British Indians.
('6', 61, 0, 1, 112913) 62 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 61, 1, 2, 112954) British whites there were not very hostile to Indians.
('6', 61, 1, 3, 113009) But there were cablegrams from Krugersdorp and other places which expressed the hope that the Ordinance would receive Royal assent.
('6', 61, 1, 4, 113141) While he would not say anything about Mr. Gandhi or Mr. Ally, he might tell them that he had received cablegrams from some Indians expressing contrary opinions.
('6', 61, 1, 5, 113302) He added that all that was by way of information only.
('6', 61, 1, 6, 113357) He did not regard the demand for a commission as unreason able.
('6', 61, 1, 7, 113421) The matter deserved consideration, and he would reply after giving it sufficient thought.
('6', 61, 1, 8, 113511) Seeking permission to speak for a minute, Mr. Gandhi said that Lord Elgins information was not correct and that, if His Lordship gave them another appointment, the two Delegates would be able to prove this.
('6', 61, 1, 9, 113718) Whether or not a second meeting materializes, all this clearly shows that the appointment of a commission is absolutely necessary and that such complicated matters can be settled only through a commission.
('6', 61, 1, 10, 113924) It is hoped that, as a result of this Deputation, a commission will be appointed.
('6', 61, 2, 11, 114006) MEMBERS OF HOUSE OF COMMONS
('6', 61, 3, 12, 114034) As we thought it would be very appropriate and helpful if the Members of the House of Commons met and passed a resolution expressing sympathy, we called upon some Members and had a discussion with them.
('6', 61, 3, 13, 114237) In this matter we sought the help of Mr. Sootie 1
('6', 61, 4, 14, 114287) a Member of Parliament who is a friend of Mr. Polaks father, and the meeting at last took place on Wednesday night.
('6', 61, 4, 15, 114403) Some half a dozen Members jointly issued a circular and invitations.
('6', 61, 4, 16, 114472) Messrs Gandhi and Ally spoke and then the meeting passed a resolution requesting Lord Elgin to accede to the demand of the Indian Deputation.
('6', 61, 4, 17, 114614) Many people think that the large meeting of Members of the House of Commons was the first of its kind in recent times.
('6', 61, 4, 18, 114733) This shows that our cause is being widely discussed.
('6', 61, 5, 19, 114786) MEETING WITH AMEER ALI
('6', 61, 6, 20, 114809) Both the members of the Deputation had a private interview with Mr. Ameer Ali, during which he expressed much sympathy for our

('6', 61, 7, 22, 114982) It was Scott who helped Gandhiji to arrange the meeting at the House of Commons; vide Letter to H. S. L. Polak, 9 11 1906.

('6', 62, 1, 2, 115148) cause and also promised to write on it, if possible, for prominent papers here.
('6', 62, 1, 3, 115228) INTERVIEW WITH LORD HAMILTON Lord George Hamilton heard us patiently for half an hour.
('6', 62, 1, 4, 115315) It will be recalled that he was at one time the Secretary of State for India.
('6', 62, 1, 5, 115393) He has agreed to go into the question fully and do his best.
('6', 62, 1, 6, 115454) This matter is often discussed in South Africa and other papers.
('6', 62, 1, 7, 115519) South Africa also published an interview 1 with Mr. Gandhi on Mr. Tathams Bill.
('6', 62, 1, 8, 115599) The correspondent has given a correct report of the interview.
('6', 62, 1, 9, 115662) A copy of the petition submitted to Lord Elgin has been sent to every Member of Parliament with a courteous covering letter.
('6', 62, 1, 10, 115787) A letter 2 seeking an interview with Mr. Morley has been despatched today.
('6', 62, 1, 11, 115862) It will probably materialize next week.
('6', 62, 1, 12, 115902) The Deputa tion has still so much work to do that it will be very difficult for it to leave on November 24.
('6', 62, 2, 13, 116010) SOUTH AFRICAN STUDENTS IN ENGLAND
('6', 62, 3, 14, 116044) A petition has been specially sent to Lord Elgin by these students.
('6', 62, 3, 15, 116112) 3 In it they have asked to know what their own plight would be under the new law; but the petition covers the question of the rights of all the others as well.
('6', 62, 3, 16, 116272) If Lord Elgin should say that separate laws would be made for those who had gone to England, he would be insulting the others; if, on the other hand, he should say that they would not get the rights, it would be gross injustice.
('6', 62, 4, 17, 116501) NATAL QUESTION
('6', 62, 5, 18, 116516) The Deputation is not concerned with Natal affairs.
('6', 62, 5, 19, 116568) However, since Mr. Tathams Bill has been published and a cablegram about it has been received here, Mr. Gandhi has asked for a private interview with Lord Elgin.
('6', 62, 5, 20, 116730) 4 He has not yet given a definite reply, but has written saying that he will do so next week.

('6', 63, 4, 6, 117233) I addressed one 1 to you yesterday, not knowing what your movements were.

('6', 63, 11, 19, 117866) DEAR SIR HENRY,
('6', 63, 12, 20, 117882) You may have seen The Times report of the interview.
('6', 63, 12, 21, 117935) In my opinion whoever gave the information, it was a shameful thing.
('6', 63, 12, 22, 118004) Sir Lepel was very much annoyed about it, when I saw him yesterday.
('6', 63, 12, 23, 118072) Three reporters carne to me on Thursday evening, and I replied that I could not possibly give them any information, as Lord Elgin wanted the interview to be treated as strictly private.
('6', 63, 12, 24, 118258) Mr. Adam of Reuters Agency has just come over to enquire whether any [member] of the deputation could have supplied The

('6', 64, 1, 3, 118460) I have assured him that such a thing is not possible.
('6', 64, 1, 4, 118514) Sir Lepel is of opinion that the information must have been given by someone in the Colonial Office.
('6', 64, 1, 5, 118615) Lord Elgins speech has been given practically word for word.
('6', 64, 1, 6, 118676) Mr. Adam su ggests, and I entirely agree, that there should be a question 1 in the House enquiring why it was that The Times was so favoured.

('6', 65, 12, 17, 120584) MY DEAR OMAR,
('6', 65, 13, 18, 120598) I have not the time to write to you in Gujarati.
('6', 65, 13, 19, 120647) I am dictating this at 9.45 p.m.
('6', 65, 13, 20, 120680) I have done all I could for the Natal question; I have sought an interview with Lord Elgin.
('6', 65, 13, 21, 120772) I received a reply on Wednesday saying that I should put down in writing what I had to state: I sent a reply the same day, stating shortly my contention and asking for a private and informal interview.
('6', 65, 13, 22, 120974) 2 I have heard again today to the effect that a reply will be sent to me next week.

('6', 66, 1, 3, 121458) I have, however, sent a cablegram suggesting 2 permanent committee here as I see that a great deal of work could be done with such a committee which should be not a Transvaal Committee but a South African Committee.
('6', 66, 1, 4, 121674) I think that with careful management it could become a most efficient body.
('6', 66, 1, 5, 121750) I sent another cablegram 1 yesterday asking for immediate authority as the committee must be formed while Mr. Ally and I are here.

('6', 66, 7, 12, 122130) DEAR MR. QADIR,
('6', 66, 8, 13, 122146) Many thanks for your note.
('6', 66, 8, 14, 122173) I am satisfied with the result of the interview with Lord Elgin, not because I am assured of success, but because of the necessary work done.
('6', 66, 8, 15, 122315) However, Lord Elgin, instead of giving a blank, negative reply, has promised to consider the proposal about the commission.
('6', 66, 8, 16, 122439) There is therefore some hope yet left.
('6', 66, 8, 17, 122478) I shall ask my manager to send you a copy of Indian Opinion regularly so long as you are in London.
('6', 66, 8, 18, 122578) When you return you can advise the manager of the change of address and copies will be posted there.

('6', 68, 5, 8, 124349) They need not necessarily be regarding the British Indian Association, Mr. Ally, or myself, but we will take copies generally regarding British Indians in South Africa.

('6', 69, 7, 8, 125654) HOTEL CECIL, LONDON, November 12, 1906
('6', 69, 8, 9, 125693) THE EDITOR
('6', 69, 9, 10, 125704) THE TIMES PRINTING HOUSE SQUARE, E.C.
('6', 69, 10, 11, 125742) SIR, By your leading article in The Times of the 10th instant on the British Indian question in the Colonies, you have lifted it from the platform of parochialism to that of Imperialism.
('6', 69, 10, 12, 125929) For the present, however, we will be thankful if you will allow us to deal with the Asiatic Law Amendment Ordinance without touching the larger issue discussed by you.
('6', 69, 10, 13, 126097) You say:
('6', 69, 11, 14, 126106) It does not seem likely or desirable that a measure, which appears to be supported generally by the opinion of the people who are shortly to have power to make their own laws, should be refused the assent of the Crown.
('6', 69, 11, 15, 126325) We venture to take exception to your opinion for the following reasons:
('6', 69, 12, 16, 126397) 1. You admit that upon the merits of the particular controversy aroused by the Ordinance there is at present hardly evidence
('6', 69, 13, 17, 126522) 1 Also quoted in Letter to Sir Henry Cotton, 12 11 1906, but the text varies slightly.
('6', 69, 13, 18, 126609) 2 This letter was not published in The Times.
('6', 70, 0, 1, 126655) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 71
('6', 70, 1, 2, 126698) enough to form judgement.
('6', 70, 2, 3, 126724) 2. The Ordinance does not affect the broad question of Asiatic Immigration into the Transvaal, but it very materially alters to their prejudice the status of British Indians resident in the Colony.
('6', 70, 3, 4, 126922) 3 It is not a purely temporary measure; for, while it is true that Mr. Duncan stated that it was introduced without prejudice to further legislation, there was no question of the Ordinance itself being a temporary measure.
('6', 70, 3, 5, 127145) In its very nature it is not capable of being temporary, because it is intended to carry out once and for all, so it is said, registration of British Indians in the Transvaal, and to compel them to carry passes, euphemistically called registration certificates.
('6', 70, 4, 6, 127407) 4. Instead of preserving the status quo and relieving the Asiatic residents from certain manifest grievances, it reduces their status and removes not a single grievance.
('6', 70, 5, 7, 127577) 5. While the prejudice on the part of the general portion of the white community is admitted, the manner of giving effect to it is purely a creation of the Government and the Transvaal community is certainly not privy to the framing of the Ordinance.
('6', 70, 5, 8, 127828) Its plan is undoubtedly drastic, but honest.
('6', 70, 5, 9, 127873) If it had its own way, perhaps that portion of it which represents anti Asiatic agitation will pass legislation involving deportation of Indian residents in the Colony.
('6', 70, 5, 10, 128042) Such, in effect, it will be reme mbered, was the resolution passed by the so called National Convention.
('6', 70, 6, 11, 128147) 6. That the Transvaal is on the eve of getting Responsible Govern ment is an additional reason why, instead of the British Indian position being prejudiced by the Ordinance in question, it should be so commended to the incoming Government as to bear the Imperial stamp; that is to say, the status of British Indians should be levelled up to that enjoyed by British Indians at the Cape.
('6', 70, 7, 12, 128533) 7. There is absolutely no proof 1 justifying a dangerous departure from the traditions of Crown Colony Government in the shape of invidious class distinctions.
('6', 70, 8, 13, 128693) 1 Of a large unauthorized influx of Indians
('6', 71, 0, 1, 128737) 72 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 71, 1, 2, 128778) 8. Involving, as the question does, Imperial considerations of the highest order, the Imperial Government should think twice before sanctioning panic legislation which underlies the Ordin ance.
('6', 71, 1, 3, 128972) The reasons we have above given for withholding the Royal sanction are also reasons showing why a commission should be appointed to go into the question, and to place such evidence before the public and the Government as is, on your own showing, at present lacking.
('6', 71, 1, 4, 129238) You, Sir, have rightly said that every Indian returning from the Transvaal to India returns a missionary to sow discontent.
('6', 71, 1, 5, 129362) We, who have the privilege of representing the community, can state that we have given only the most moderate expression to the sentiments of the thousands who attended the mass meeting referred to by you.
('6', 71, 1, 6, 129568) It is not possible for us to describe in words the bitterness which animated that meeting regarding the measure.
('6', 71, 1, 7, 129681) The lower the status of the Indian, the greater would be his hardship under the Ordinance.
('6', 71, 1, 8, 129772) The well to do Indian may by reason of his position be able to escape the grossest forms of oppression which must inevitably flow from the Ordinance.
('6', 71, 1, 9, 129922) Poor people were, under the registration effected by Lord Milners advice, dragged at four oclock on a cold winters morning from their beds in Johannesburg, Heidelberg and Potchefstroom, and marched to the police station, or Asiatic Offices, as the case might be.
('6', 71, 1, 10, 130185) 1 It is they who under the Ordinance would be hustled by the Kaffir Police at every turn, and not the better class Indians.
('6', 71, 1, 11, 130309) They, therefore, feel the treatment more than we do, because to them their hardship is an ever present reality.
('6', 71, 1, 12, 130421) The Indian community has all along contended that there is no unauthorized influx on a wholesale scale, that there is no attempt by the community to countenance any such influx, that the present machinery is absolutely effective to check unauthorized entry and the documents already held by Indians are sufficient for purposes of identification.
('6', 71, 1, 13, 130767) If these statements are challenged, as they have been challenged, is it not at least in common fairness necessary to appoint a commission of enquiry [?]

('6', 72, 4, 7, 131306) May I venture to ask you to write a short letter to The Times emphasizing the question of discontent and the Imperial importance of the question.
('6', 72, 4, 8, 131452) I beg to enclose herewith copy of the letter 1 written by Mr. Ally and myself to The Times.
('6', 72, 4, 9, 131544) I have been considering with Sir Muncherji the question of forming a permanent committee for the South African Indians.
('6', 72, 4, 10, 131664) The work of the Deputation will be frittered away if it cannot be continued after its return to South Africa.
('6', 72, 4, 11, 131774) If a small committee was formed it would be a very great assistance.
('6', 72, 4, 12, 131843) May we rely upon your co operation.
('6', 72, 4, 13, 131879) Mr. Ally and I will be obliged if you will lend your name to the committee.

('6', 74, 9, 11, 134069) I am obliged to you for the copy of the Minutes of the deputation that waited on His Lordship on Thursday last.
('6', 74, 9, 12, 134181) I note this copy is marked Confidential.
('6', 74, 9, 13, 134222) His Lordship may have seen the report of the proceedings in The Times.
('6', 74, 9, 14, 134293) I may state that four reporters
('6', 74, 10, 15, 134325) 1 None of these is available.
('6', 74, 10, 16, 134355) However, a letter from Sir Roper Lethbridge who was not a member of the deputation appeared in The Times, 12 11 1906. Sir Roper, who was editor of The Englishman, Calcutta, said that the entire British community in India was in sympathy with the representation of the Transvaal Indians to Lord Elgin.

('6', 74, 11, 18, 134769) Either the note was posted on November 13 or the draft letter was merely dated November 13 for the convenience of Sir Muncherji who was to send it to The Times under his signature.

('6', 75, 1, 2, 134991) came to me immediately after the interview and asked me to give them a report of the meeting.
('6', 75, 1, 3, 135085) I told them that I was pledged by His Lordship to privacy.
('6', 75, 1, 4, 135144) I was therefore somewhat surprised to find the report in The Times.
('6', 75, 1, 5, 135212) I approached Sir Lepel Griffin, and he too expressed surprise.
('6', 75, 1, 6, 135275) I am quite at a loss to understand how The Times secured the information.
('6', 75, 1, 7, 135349) In view of the fact that a report of the proceedings has appeared in The Times and that it does not represent at all fully the statements submitted to His Lordship on behalf of British Indians, will His Lordship permit me to give a copy of the Minutes to the Press?

('6', 75, 9, 18, 136098) Papers publish full report confe rence. This cablegram means that a full report has been publis hed in Johannesburg and reference has evidently been made to the cablegram referred to by Lord Elgin.
('6', 75, 9, 19, 136296) Mr. Ally and I know the gentleman well.
('6', 75, 9, 20, 136336) Personally I can only say that he is a little insane.
('6', 75, 9, 21, 136390) He is a medical man and has taken his degree at Edinburgh and in measures to be taken against the Ordinance he would go much further than we should.
('6', 75, 9, 22, 136539) Indeed he even advocated violent measures, that is simply because there is no problem placed before him for solution but he loses his mental balance.
('6', 75, 9, 23, 136689) There are other matters connected with Dr. Godfrey proving the statement made by me which I need not touch upon at any rate for the present.

('6', 76, 1, 3, 137037) They too are enraged at their brothers con duct and even went so far as to suggest that they should publicly disown his conduct.
('6', 76, 1, 4, 137166) 2 Mr. Ally and I have, however, told them that such a course is not at all necessary.

('6', 83, 6, 10, 145672) THE EDITOR THE TIMES [LONDON]
('6', 83, 8, 11, 145702) All thoughtful men must welcome your weighty leader on the Transvaal British Indian question which has recently come to the fore by reason of the visit of the Indian Deputation from the Transvaal.
('6', 83, 8, 12, 145899) I have carefully read and re read your remarks and I must confess that all that you have stated goes conclusively to show that Lord Elgin cannot possibly advise His Majesty to sanction the Asiatic Law Amendment Ordinance.
('6', 83, 8, 13, 146121) As Sir Lepel graphically put before Lord Elgin, The toad under the harrow knows where and whether it is hurt! The Ordinance which is supposed to relieve British Indians has given rise to the greatest irritation to the Indian community.
('6', 83, 8, 14, 146357) You will perhaps give me the credit for knowing fairly intimately the British

('6', 84, 1, 2, 146599) Indian question in South Africa which I have always considered to be one of the first class magnitude.
('6', 84, 1, 3, 146702) You, sir, have now very ably shown the Imperial importance of the question.
('6', 84, 1, 4, 146778) About a year ago, at a sitting of the Legislative Council of the Transvaal, Sir George Farrar suggested that a commission should be sent to the Transvaal to enquire into the whole position.
('6', 84, 1, 5, 146968) I immediately accepted the proposition and approached Mr. Lyttelton who, had he been still at the Colonial Office, 1 I doubt not, would have appointed a commission.
('6', 84, 1, 6, 147133) In view of the approaching Colonial Conference, it becomes doubly imperative that the Imperial Government should appoint such a commission so that the Conference may have reliable data before it to go upon.
('6', 84, 1, 7, 147340) There can be no conceivable objection from any quarter to the appointment of such a commission.
('6', 84, 1, 8, 147436) Not to prejudge the case it will be only reasonable to withhold the Royal sanction for the Ordinance in question, pending the report of any such commission that may be appointed.
('6', 84, 1, 9, 147615) I re echo your opinion regarding the terrible discontent that is being spread by British Indians from South Africa.
('6', 84, 1, 10, 147731) As you very properly say, it is not a question of political disabilities but one of inability to enjoy the ordinary rights of a British subject or even a human being in a civilized country.
('6', 84, 1, 11, 147921) If the Colonies persist in their policy of exclusion, they will force on the mother country for solution a very serious problem which the late Sir William Wilson Hunters 2
('6', 84, 2, 12, 148093) used to reiterate in your columns, namely, Is India to remain a part of the British Dominions or not? He who runs may read that England will find it difficult to hold India if her people, immediately they migrated to British Colonies, are to be insulted and degraded as if they belonged to barbarous race.

('6', 90, 10, 16, 155792) Perhaps it is necessary for me to say a word about thepetition from certain Indians regarding the British Indian Deputation from the Transvaal which was the subject matter of question and answer in Parliament as reported in your issue of yesterdays date.
('6', 90, 10, 17, 156047) It is said

('6', 91, 1, 2, 156138) therein that I do not possess any mandate, that I am a professional agitator and that my advocacy of the Indian cause has resulted in harm being done to the Indians.
('6', 91, 2, 3, 156304) The appointment of my colleague and myself was made unanimously at a public meeting.
('6', 91, 2, 4, 156389) We hold a document to that effect.
('6', 91, 3, 5, 156424) The mass meeting at Johannesburg which was convened by me as Secretary to the British Indian Association approved of the principle of the Delegation.
('6', 91, 3, 6, 156574) The first signatory 2 to this petition was present at the meeting and spoke strongly in support of all the principal resolutions.
('6', 91, 3, 7, 156704) He, moreover, offered himself as one of the delegates but was not accepted.
('6', 91, 3, 8, 156780) The petition is signed by two Indians.
('6', 91, 3, 9, 156819) It is necessary to distinguish the petition from a paper purporting to have been signed by 437 Indians and repudiating our mandate.
('6', 91, 3, 10, 156951) As to this, the following cable was received by the Delegates from Johannes burg on the 10th instant: Have affidavits Godfrey obtained signat ures blank paper false pretences using name bias (code word for the British Indian Association, Transvaal) signatures now with drawn cabling (Lord) Elgin papers publish full report conference. The foregoing cable was evidently sent on the telegra phic report of the interview sent by the Press correspondents.
('6', 91, 4, 11, 157403) The incident does not mean that the two signatories of the petition approve of the Asiatic Ordinance.
('6', 91, 4, 12, 157505) On the contrary, in their opinion evidently I am the mischievous cause of the legislation which they detest as much as the other Indians.
('6', 91, 4, 13, 157643) Their attitude resolves itself into personal objection to me and not into one of approval of the Ordinance.
('6', 91, 5, 14, 157751) As I have been allowed by the Colonial Office to see the petition I know that the expression professional agitator means a paid agitator I may then state that the thirteen years service rendered by me to my countrymen has been a labour of love and [a matter of the] keenest pleasure to me.
('6', 91, 6, 15, 158041) Opinions may differ as to the usefulness or otherwise of my services.

('6', 93, 12, 15, 159758) I have just been talking to a valued friend 1 about the conversation we had yesterday.
('6', 93, 12, 16, 159845) He is a missionary belonging to the Arya Samaj of the Punjab.
('6', 93, 12, 17, 159907) The Samaj is to Hinduism what Protestantism is to Catholicism.
('6', 93, 12, 18, 159970) The missionary friend is under a vow of poverty and his talents are devoted to the work of education combined with religion.
('6', 93, 12, 19, 160095) He is an M.A. of Punjab University but in order to increase his usefulness he is staying in London and studying for the London M.A. I suggested to him that, if he could enter a quiet, nice English home, he would be able to see the real culture and beauty of English life which would be of immense use in his work.
('6', 93, 12, 20, 160409) At the same time he is to live as cheaply as possible.
('6', 93, 12, 21, 160464) Do you know a home that would take him without pecuniary consideration?

('6', 94, 9, 10, 160982) HOTEL CECIL, LONDON, November 16, 1906
('6', 94, 10, 11, 161021) DEAR SIR,
('6', 94, 11, 12, 161031) As you were good enough to show very great sympathy with the cause of British Indians in the Transvaal, may I suggest your using your influence with the Boer leaders in the Transvaal?
('6', 94, 11, 13, 161215) I feel certain that they did not share the same prejudice against British Indians as against the Kaffir races but as the prejudice against Kaffir races in a strong form was in existence in the Transvaal at the time when the British Indians immigrated there, the latter were immediately lumped together with the Kaffir races and described under the generic term Coloured people.
('6', 94, 11, 14, 161593) Gradually the Boer mind was habituated to this qualification and it refused to recognize the evident and sharp distinctions that undoubtedly exist between British Indians and the Kaffir races in South Africa.
('6', 94, 12, 15, 161802) If you were to place this position before them in your own graphic style and show to them that British Indians have an ancient civilization behind them, that they do not aspire to any political power in the Transvaal, that they are a mere handful, i.e., 13,000, and
('6', 95, 0, 1, 162068) 96 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 95, 1, 2, 162109) that further immigration can easily be regulated without accentuating class difference, I have no doubt that some at least of the Boer leaders would listen to you and give effect to your suggestions.
('6', 95, 2, 3, 162309) The Indian community in the Transvaal will feel deeply grateful to you if you could see your way to influence the Boer mind in the direction I have ventured to suggest to you.
('6', 95, 3, 4, 162485) I remain,

('6', 95, 10, 11, 162690) DEAR MR. POLAK,
('6', 95, 11, 12, 162706) I havent a moment to spare for any leading articles or matter.
('6', 95, 11, 13, 162769) You will see from India a question 1 and answer regarding the Godfrey petition.
('6', 95, 11, 14, 162849) Is it not a strange irony of fate that, while the doctor is madly doing all he can to injure the cause, his two brothers here are doing and rendering all the assistance in their power to further the cause?
('6', 95, 11, 15, 163055) Arithmetically, therefore, any evil effect produced by the activity of the one should be neutralized, especially when it is remembered that the activity of the two is in the direction of the right course.

('6', 96, 1, 3, 163590) Your cablegram tells me that your Association is cabling Lord Elgin.
('6', 96, 1, 4, 163659) Up to the time of writing it would appear that the cablegram has not arrived.
('6', 96, 2, 5, 163737) I may have to cable next week for information.
('6', 96, 3, 6, 163784) We meet Mr. Morley on the 22nd.
('6', 96, 3, 7, 163816) I think the deputation will be strong.
('6', 96, 3, 8, 163855) Sir Lepel Griffin will head it.
('6', 96, 4, 9, 163887) A room has been engaged for the permanent committee at 40 per year.
('6', 96, 4, 10, 163955) Furniture has been bought for 25. Sir Muncherjee will probably be the chairman.
('6', 96, 4, 11, 164035) More later.
('6', 96, 5, 12, 164047) I am afraid that we cannot leave before the 1st week of next month because the committee will require organizing and there will be some work to be done after the interview with Morley.
('6', 96, 5, 13, 164232) We had an exceedingly nice chat with Mr. Stead.
('6', 96, 5, 14, 164280) He has promised to do all he can.
('6', 96, 5, 15, 164314) I have therefore suggested to him that he should write to his Boer friends to distinguish between Coloured people belonging to different nationalities.

('6', 97, 6, 10, 166099) Mr. Ally and I have come as a Deputation on behalf of British Indians in the Transvaal to wait on Lord Elgin and Mr. Morley.
('6', 97, 6, 11, 166224) The Deputation has already, as you know, waited on Lord Elgin.
('6', 97, 6, 12, 166287) Mr. Morley receives the deputation on Thursday next the 22 nd instant at 12.20 p.m.

('6', 97, 12, 24, 166939) I note that Lord Elgin has no objection to the Minutes of the

('6', 98, 6, 9, 167451) November 16, 1906
('6', 98, 7, 10, 167469) With reference to the petition signed by Dr. W. Godfrey and C. M. Pillay, apparently on behalf of 437 other British Indians, who discla im having given Mr. M. K. Gandhi any mandate to represent them in England, (which formed the subject of a question in the House by Sir Henry Cotton last week) Mr. Gandhi has stated to a representative of South Africa that a cablegram has been received from Johannesburg stating that the signatures of the 437 British Indians mentioned were obtained on blank paper by Dr. Godfrey, using the name of the British Indian Association.
('6', 98, 8, 11, 168035) Mr. Gandhi said: So far as the position of the Ordinance itself is concerned, it is not affected by the petition (which is signed only by Dr. Godfrey and an interpreter named C. M. Pillay), as Dr. Godfrey was the strongest opponent of the Ordinance at the mass meeting held at the old Empire Theatre in September, when it was decided to send a Deputation to England.
('6', 98, 8, 12, 168402) The only reason I can assign for his action is that he was very much annoyed because he himself was not elected as one of the delegates when the matter came before the committee appointed at that meeting to nominate the representatives to go to London.
('6', 98, 8, 13, 168655) The petition of Messrs Godfrey and Pillay represents that I am a professional political agitator.
('6', 98, 8, 14, 168753) As to that statement it can only

('6', 99, 2, 3, 169165) Mr. Gandhi, in conclusion, showed a document, dated Johannesburg, October 1, 1906, and signed Abdool Ganie, Chairman, British Indian Association, certifying that M. K. Gandhi, Esquire, Honorary Secretary of the British Indian Association, and Hajee Ojer Ally, Esquire, President of the Hamidia Islamic Society, have been elected as Delegates to proceed to London for the purpose of submitting to the Imperial authorities the Indian view of the Asiatic Law Amendment Ordinance, as also to interview friends in England of British Indians in South Africa.

('6', 99, 5, 6, 169775) [After November 16, 1906]
('6', 99, 6, 7, 169801) At a well attended meeting of the London Indian Society, on the 3 rd November, at 84 and 85, Palace Chambers, Westminster, the Honble Dadabhai Naoroji in the chair, Mr. James Godfrey of Natal, who is at present keeping his terms for the Bar and has passed his final examination, gave a paper under the above title 2. Below is given a condensation of the paper: Since my arrival here, I have had ample opportunities of studying these people and I hope to show you that there are very many valuable lessons to be learnt from them.
('6', 99, 6, 8, 170330) Let us examine and analyse them and see what qualities have made them what they are and what are the potent factors which are securing for them the universal triumph which seems to be growing larger and larger every day, and which must command the admiration of even their bitterest enemies.
('6', 99, 6, 9, 170622) I was led to make this examination myself owing to what I felt were unsatisfactory replies given to me by a large number of our countrymen when leaving this land for home.
('6', 99, 6, 10, 170794) Invariably I put them the question: What has England taught
('6', 99, 7, 11, 170854) 1 This is a report of the meeting held on November 3, and was published in Indian Opinion as specially contributed.
('6', 99, 7, 12, 170970) It was written by Gandhiji; vide Letter to H. S. L. Polak, 16 11 1906.
('6', 99, 8, 13, 171041) 2 This item was published under the sub title, The Englishman as I Find Him
('6', 100, 0, 1, 171117) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 101
('6', 100, 1, 2, 171161) you or what improvements have you in mind to suggest to your people when you return? And to such questions I received the painful and saddening reply to the effect that they had been too much occupied with their immediate studies and occupations to devote any time to or concern themselves about the people or things surrounding them.
('6', 100, 1, 3, 171496) As to improvements at home, that is a question which affects local interests and, therefore, must necessarily need local considera tion, etc.
('6', 100, 1, 4, 171638) Now gentlemen, I put it to you that such replies are anything but satisfactory.
('6', 100, 1, 5, 171718) Whether this be the frame of mind of the majority who go back, I will not take upon myself the responsibility of stating.
('6', 100, 1, 6, 171840) I hope I shall be told I am mistaken.
('6', 100, 1, 7, 171878) Be that as it may, the knowledge of the fact of even one of us returning home in this mood of utter indifference and doubt, I feel, amply justifies a reference to the subject in a paper of this kind.
('6', 100, 1, 8, 172078) The Englishman abroad is one person and the Englishman at home is quite another.
('6', 100, 1, 9, 172159) In the first case he proves himself to be a veritable tyrant and a despot, but in the second case, i.e., in England, few will say that he is not a desirable person.
('6', 100, 2, 10, 172324) From this you will see, therefore, that we actually arrive in this country with more or less prejudiced views and ideas, and apparently some never seem to get beyond that stage, and can never see or appreciate any good in the Englishman.
('6', 100, 2, 11, 172562) We never seem to realize that we have come all the way from home in order to benefit ourselves and secure that experience and status which it is somewhat difficult for us to secure in our own land.
('6', 100, 2, 12, 172760) We come, not with the intention of merely qualifying in some particular profession, but of simultaneously gaining that wider experience of the world and its ways which can only be had by travelling in foreign countries.
('6', 100, 2, 13, 172980) We defeat the very object of our visit to this country if we do not carry away with us some of the multifarious benefits derived by our sojourn here.
('6', 100, 2, 14, 173130) We want, after our staying here, to go back with the very best that the place can give us...
('6', 100, 2, 15, 173223) If we dont, the loss is ours and we are not doing our duty to ourselves, much less to our country.
('6', 100, 3, 16, 173322) The success of the Japanese is admitted on all hands to have been due chiefly to their having, for the last 40 years or more, sent out students and specialists for the express purpose of eliciting the best information, learning the newest and latest inventions and carrying back the cream of Europes learning, advancement and ideas of progress, all for the benefit of their country.
('6', 100, 3, 17, 173705) Mark you, they did not
('6', 101, 0, 1, 173728) 102 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 101, 1, 2, 173770) only carry this knowledge and ideas back, but they actually applied them with a result and success which have astonished the whole world.
('6', 101, 1, 3, 173908) Let us try and reckon up some of their good points only and see if they are worth copying.
('6', 101, 1, 4, 173999) The bad points we leave aside.
('6', 101, 1, 5, 174030) Throughout their whole history, we find that they have displayed a remarkable spirit of love for freedom and independence.
('6', 101, 1, 6, 174153) Did they not have to fight for this bit of land which they now proudly call England?
('6', 101, 1, 7, 174238) Did they not have both internal and external foes and that through many centuries?
('6', 101, 1, 8, 174321) The wonderful genius of the race seems to have conspired with the strengthening influence of the place itself in securing a sure, certain and steady progress onward.
('6', 101, 1, 9, 174487) The great American writer, R. W. Emerson, says: These Saxons are the hands of mankind.
('6', 101, 1, 10, 174574) They have the taste for toil, a distaste for pleasure or repose and the telescopic appreciation of distant gain.
('6', 101, 1, 11, 174687) They are the wealth makers and by dint of mental faculty which has its own conditions and terms.
('6', 101, 1, 12, 174784) The Saxon works after liking or only for himself and to set him at work and begin to draw his monstrous values out of barren Britain, all dishonour, fret and barrier must be removed and then his energies begin to play. We see then that the whole mind of the race, so to say, has been expanding proportionately.
('6', 101, 1, 13, 175095) They have persevered in it and kept up an even game.
('6', 101, 1, 14, 175148) The English game appears to be one of main force to main force, the planting of foot to foot, fairplay and open field, a rough tug without trick or dodging.
('6', 101, 1, 15, 175305) One cannot entertain any reasonable doubt of their ability and energy.
('6', 101, 1, 16, 175376) Just realize for one moment the nature of the lightly artificial construction of the whole fabric here.
('6', 101, 1, 17, 175480) The very climate and geography are in themselves matters which are contrary to such conditions as would enhance a natural existence.
('6', 101, 1, 18, 175613) Bacon says: Rome was a state not subject to paradoxes, but England subsists by antagonisms and contradictions and is a perfect museum of anomalies. Is it not true, though it has been humorously said, that no fruits ripen in England but a baked apple, and, again, is it not equally true that no indigenous animal worth the mention has ever before flourished in this country in comparison with other countries?
('6', 101, 1, 19, 176022) Yet in spite of these natural difficulties they have, owing to their dogged perseverance, tact, zeal and energy, driven all before them and are now at the top of the tree.
('6', 101, 1, 20, 176194) There seems to be some secret

('6', 102, 1, 2, 176268) power which permeates the whole nation and makes for progress.
('6', 102, 1, 3, 176331) They have pride and affection for their race.
('6', 102, 1, 4, 176377) Do we not hear everyone of them boasting and priding himself on the fact of his being an Englishman?
('6', 102, 1, 5, 176478) Does he not flout it to your face at every turn that because he is an Englishman therefore he rules?
('6', 102, 1, 6, 176579) They have solidarity or responsibility and trust in each other.
('6', 102, 1, 7, 176643) It has been said of the Englishmen that they embrace their cause with more tenacity than their lives.
('6', 102, 1, 8, 176745) The paper was very well received.
('6', 102, 1, 9, 176779) Messrs B. J. Wadia, M.A., Parmeshwar Lall, M.A., J. Gowrieshanker, M.A., Nathuram, Dwarka Das and several other gentlemen who took part in the discussion congratulated the lecturer on his broad mindedness and theability with which he had written his paper.
('6', 102, 1, 10, 177036) Some of the speakers thought that Mr. Godfrey had over drawn the picture in favour of the Englishman, but Mr. Godfrey in his reply, whilst thanking the members for their sympathetic reception, said that he had purposely left out the other side of the Englishmans character, but he wanted to place before the members of the Society what he conside red was best in his character and what was worthy ofimitation.
('6', 102, 1, 11, 177446) A vote of thanks to the lecturer and to the Chair brought the proceedings to a close.

('6', 102, 4, 14, 177589) [After November 16, 1906]
('6', 102, 5, 15, 177615) A meeting of the Pan Islamic Society, whose headquarters are in London, took place at the Criterion Restaurant, on the 3 rd November, in honour of its Founder and retiring Secretary, Mr. Abdullah Al Mamoon Sohraworthy, M.A., M.K.R.S., Barrister at Law.
('6', 102, 5, 16, 177868) At the reception were present Mr. Syed Ameer Ali (ex Judge of the High Court of Judicature at Calcutta), Mr. Dadabhai Naoroji, Mr. Shamji Krishnavarma, Mr. S. A. Quadir, Miss Martha Craig, Miss A. A. Smith, Mrs. Conseil, His Excellency Hamid Beg (Councillor of the

('6', 103, 1, 3, 178621) Mr. M. H. Kidwai, of Lucknow, received the guests.
('6', 103, 1, 4, 178672) Mr. Sohraworthy, the retiring Secretary, has had a distinguished career in London.
('6', 103, 1, 5, 178755) He is a much travelled man and is the author of Malki Law, as also the Sayings of Mahomed.
('6', 103, 1, 6, 178846) He has made Pan Islamism his life work, and in his striking, though somewhat lengthy speech, he clearly showed that the object of Pan Islamism was to bring together under its fold the different sects of Mahomedans and carry on a peaceful propaganda of the faith of the Prophet with a view to promote universal brotherhood.
('6', 103, 1, 7, 179169) This Society, which was originally called the Anjuman e Islam, was founded in 1886 in London.
('6', 103, 1, 8, 179263) On the 23rd of June, 1903, it was re named the Pan Islamic Society.
('6', 103, 1, 9, 179331) Mr. Ameer Ali was at one time President of this body.
('6', 103, 1, 10, 179385) The following are the avowed objects of the Society:
('6', 103, 2, 11, 179438) (a) To promote the religious, social, moral and intellectual advancement of the Mussulman world.
('6', 103, 2, 12, 179535) (b) To afford a centre of social union to Muslims from all parts of the world.
('6', 103, 2, 13, 179614) (c) To promote brotherly feelings between Muslims, and to facilitate intercourse between them.
('6', 103, 2, 14, 179709) (d) To remove misconceptions prevailing among non Muslims regarding Islam and Mussulman.
('6', 103, 2, 15, 179798) (e) To render legitimate assistance to the best of its ability to any Muslim requiring it in any part of the world.
('6', 103, 2, 16, 179914) (f) To provide facilities for conducting religious ceremonies in non Muslim countries.
('6', 103, 2, 17, 180001) (g) To hold debates and lectures, and to read papers likely to further the interests of Islam.
('6', 103, 2, 18, 180096) (h) To collect subscriptions from all parts of the world in order to build a mosque in London, and to endow it, and to extend the burial ground for the Muslims in London.
('6', 103, 2, 19, 180267) Its members are ordinary, extraordinary and honorary.
('6', 103, 2, 20, 180321) The annual subscription for ordinary resident members is 10/6; non resident members pay only an entrance fee of 5/6.

('6', 104, 5, 7, 180756) QUESTION I
('6', 104, 6, 8, 180767) Has the Right Honble the Colonial Secretary received a petition from Mr. Abdul Ganie, Chairman of the British Indian Association of the Transvaal, regarding the Vrededorp Stands Ordinance published in the Transvaal Government Gazette dated September 28 last?
('6', 104, 6, 9, 181026) Will His Lordship advise His Majesty, under the power reserved under the Letters Patent, to disallow the Ordinance, in that it imposes on British Indians and other Coloured people a restriction as to holding leases of or remaining in occupation of Stands in Vrededorp?
('6', 104, 6, 10, 181295) Is it not a fact that Vrededorp is contiguous to a Location called the Malay Location and inhabited largely by British Indians?
('6', 104, 6, 11, 181423) Is it not a fact that British Indians are already in occupation of several Stands in Vrededorp, that some of them have built substantial structures on some Stands and that they are carrying on their trade on such Stands?
('6', 104, 6, 12, 181644) Is it not also a fact that many British Indians resided in Vrededorp during the Dutch regime and that there was no objection taken to their presence during that time?
('6', 104, 7, 13, 181811) QUESTION II
('6', 104, 8, 14, 181823) In view of the foregoing question does it not appear to the Right Honble the Secretary of State for the Colonies necessary that an impartial commission should be appointed to investigate the whole question of the status of British Indians in the Transvaal?
('6', 104, 9, 15, 182080) 1 These four questions appear to have been drafted by Gandhi for Members of Parliament.
('6', 104, 9, 16, 182168) The fourth one at any rate was sent to J. D. Rees with the covering letter (p.
('6', 104, 9, 17, 182247) 181) dated November 17, 1906. The question was put to Churchill on November 22, 1906. Both the question and the answer were reproduced in India, 1 12 1906.

('6', 105, 1, 2, 182445) QUESTION III
('6', 105, 2, 3, 182458) Is there any precedent for legislation in the British Colonies after the manner of the Asiatic Law Amendment Ordinance published in the Transvaal Government Gazette dated the 28th September, 1906?

('6', 106, 7, 16, 185206) I had intended to speak to you about it when I saw you at Palace Chambers.

('6', 109, 4, 6, 188004) The young man 1 for whom I have written to you, 2 is to study for the Matriculation Examination at the same time that he is studying for the Bar.
('6', 109, 4, 7, 188150) He has already kept some terms.
('6', 109, 4, 8, 188182) His previous education is very poor and it is necessary for him, if he is to hold his own in future, to go as far as the Matriculation of London University.
('6', 109, 4, 9, 188339) The young man will stay there, or anywhere he is put, the whole of his time.
('6', 109, 4, 10, 188416) His previous certificate given to him by the Head Master of the Higher Grade Indian School in Durban is filed with the Steward of Lincolns Inn.
('6', 109, 4, 11, 188560) Would you require production of the certificate or will a certificate from me be considered enough?
('6', 109, 4, 12, 188660) I may state that he is not a Christian but a Hindoo.
('6', 109, 4, 13, 188713) I notice that the current term is half finished; will there be any reduction on that account?

('6', 111, 6, 11, 190853) INTERVIEWS WITH LEADERS: SYMPATHY AND PROMISE OF HELP
('6', 111, 7, 12, 190907) The last week has been very busy.
('6', 111, 7, 13, 190941) We have had not a moments leisure.
('6', 111, 7, 14, 190976) We saw Mr. Theodore Morison of Aligarh and the well known Mr. Stead of the Review of Reviews.
('6', 111, 7, 15, 191070) Mr. Stead has boldly come out to give us all the help he can.
('6', 111, 7, 16, 191132) He was therefore requested to write to the Boer leaders that they should not consider Indians as being on the same level as Kaffirs.
('6', 111, 8, 17, 191265) We also saw Miss Smith, a lady who contributes to the Punjabee and the Amrita Bazar Patrika.
('6', 111, 8, 18, 191358) Miss Winterbottom, the Secretary of the Union of Ethical Societies, has promised to render all possible help.
('6', 111, 9, 19, 191468) We had an interview on Transvaal and Natal matters with the Private Secretary to Lord Elgin.
('6', 111, 9, 20, 191561) We talked about many things, and we may hope for some satisfactory results.
('6', 111, 9, 21, 191637) From Mr. Churchills reply to Sir Henry Cotton it appears that, for the present at least, the Ordinance will not receive assent.
('6', 111, 9, 22, 191765) The Pan Islamic Society has made a representation to Lord Elgin, saying that the feelings of the Muslim community have been

('6', 112, 1, 2, 192156) greatly hurt by the application of the Ordinance to Turkish Muslims, while the Christians and the Jews of Turkey have been excluded from its purview.
('6', 112, 1, 3, 192306) Thus, help is being received from all quarters.
('6', 112, 1, 4, 192354) Mr. Ally had an interview with Sir Richard Solomon and because of this too, we have some ground for hope.
('6', 112, 2, 5, 192460) GODFREYS PETITION 1
('6', 112, 3, 6, 192480) There is no rose without thorns.
('6', 112, 3, 7, 192513) And these hopes have a thorn in the shape of Dr. Godfreys petition.
('6', 112, 3, 8, 192581) I am not depressed on this account.
('6', 112, 3, 9, 192617) Neither need it hurt our feelings.
('6', 112, 3, 10, 192652) We should not be angry with Dr. Godfrey.
('6', 112, 3, 11, 192693) He is a child and lacks understanding.
('6', 112, 3, 12, 192732) Often he is unaware of his own folly.
('6', 112, 3, 13, 192770) He deserves pity rather than scorn.
('6', 112, 3, 14, 192806) Lord Elgins secretary showed us his petition, in which he states that the Indian community has given no authority to Messrs Gandhi and Ally.
('6', 112, 3, 15, 192947) Mr. Gandhi was a paid agitator and had amassed money through that trade.
('6', 112, 3, 16, 193020) The whites of Durban had beaten him up in 1896 2
('6', 112, 4, 17, 193069) and driven him away.
('6', 112, 4, 18, 193090) His activities had resulted in great harm and created differences between the whites and the Coloured people.
('6', 112, 4, 19, 193200) One Mr. Abdool Gani was the Chairman [of the British Indian Associa tion] and he knew nothing [of all this].
('6', 112, 4, 20, 193309) Mr. Ally was a rebel who wanted to establish the authority of the Calif 3 in political matters also.
('6', 112, 4, 21, 193410) The petition bears the signatures of Dr. Godfrey and Mr. C. M. Pillay.
('6', 112, 4, 22, 193481) They also state that many persons did not sign the petition as they were afraid of the Association.
('6', 112, 4, 23, 193581) Besides the petition, there is a document which is said to have been signed by 437 Indians.
('6', 112, 4, 24, 193673) It says that Messrs Gandhi and Ally have no authority to act on behalf of the Indian community.
('6', 112, 4, 25, 193769) The best part of the petition is now known to the public as Sir Henry Cotton asked a question about it in Parliament.
('6', 112, 4, 26, 193887) As the question was raised by many, Sir Muncherji has addressed a letter [to The Times] on it, but this has not yet been published.
('6', 112, 4, 27, 194019) Mr. Gandhi, too, has written one.
('6', 112, 4, 28, 194053) And the two brothers of Dr. Godfrey who have been actively assisting the Deputation have also written to the Press.
('6', 112, 4, 29, 194169) When all these letters are published, it is expected that the storm will blow over.
('6', 112, 4, 30, 194253) It is necessary that all this news be published; it need not, however, cause any nervousness.

('6', 113, 1, 4, 194638) In the article written by Sir Roper Lethbridge also, it is stated that India is very unhappy because of the sufferings of the Indian community.

('6', 113, 1, 6, 194889) Accordingly a room has been rented for a year; 40 will have to be paid as rent.
('6', 113, 1, 7, 194969) Sir Muncherji has helped a lot.
('6', 113, 1, 8, 195001) He will probably become the chairman of the committee.
('6', 113, 1, 9, 195056) Furniture worth 25 has been purchased.
('6', 113, 1, 10, 195095) It is proposed to give a thanksgiving dinner to all the gentlemen who have helped us, and to announce the formation of the committee on that occasion.
('6', 113, 1, 11, 195246) As the time is short, it remains to be seen how much of all this can be done.
('6', 113, 1, 12, 195324) Mr. Ritch will work as secretary of the committee.

('6', 125, 4, 5, 209168) COLONIAL OFFICE DOWNING STREET
('6', 125, 5, 6, 209199) DEAR SIR, With reference to the interview that Mr. Ally and I had with you and Mr. Just in connection with the petition received from Dr. Godfrey and another and the papers said to be signed by 437 Indians and in connection with matters arising out of His Lordships reply to the Deputation that waited on him on the 8th day of November, in accordance with your instructions, Mr. Ally and I submit herewith a written statement for submission to His Lordship.
('6', 125, 6, 7, 209657) I have the honour to be,
('6', 125, 8, 8, 209682) Your obedient servant, M. K. GANDHI Enclosure [ENCLODURE]
('6', 125, 9, 9, 209740) STATEMENT BY THE DELEGATES ON BEHALF OF THE BRITISH INDIANS
('6', 125, 10, 10, 209800) IN THE TRANSVAAL REGARDING THE  PETITION FROM DR.
('6', 125, 10, 11, 209850) WILLIAM GODFREY AND ANOTHER AND OTHER MATTERS
('6', 125, 11, 12, 209896)  THE PETITION
('6', 125, 12, 13, 209910) 1. The petition is signed by Dr. William Godfrey and C. M. Pillay both of whom are personally known to the Delegates.
('6', 125, 12, 14, 210028) 2. Petitioner William Godfrey is a doctor of Edinburgh University and is practising in Johannesburg.
('6', 125, 12, 15, 210129) 3. The petitioner C. M. Pillay is an interpreter of no standing.
('6', 125, 12, 16, 210194) He has been found to be the worse for liquor and may be described as a loafer.
('6', 126, 0, 1, 210273) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 127
('6', 126, 1, 2, 210317) 4. So far as the recollection of the Delegates serves rightly, the points made in the petition are as follows:
('6', 126, 2, 3, 210428) (a) Delegates have no mandate from the general body of Indians.
('6', 126, 3, 4, 210492) (b) Mr. Gandhi is a professional agitator who has made money out of his work.
('6', 126, 4, 5, 210570) (c) Mr. Gandhi has caused an estrangement between Europeans and Indians and his advocacy has resulted in harm to the community.
('6', 126, 5, 6, 210698) (d) He was mobbed at Durban by the European community.
('6', 126, 6, 7, 210753) (e) He is proprietor of Indian Opinion.
('6', 126, 7, 8, 210793) (f) Mr. Ally is Chairman and founder of a politico religious body which has as its object recognition of the Sultan as both the spiritual and political head of the Moslems.
('6', 126, 8, 9, 210966) (g) A Mr. Abdul Ganie is President of the British Indian Association.
('6', 126, 9, 10, 211036) (h) The petitioners have not been able to receive support for their contentions because of the intimidation on the part of the British Indian Association.
('6', 126, 10, 11, 211191) 5. As to (a), the Delegates enclose herewith letter 1 signed by the Chairman of the British Indian Association.
('6', 126, 10, 12, 211303) Their election was unanimous.
('6', 126, 10, 13, 211333) It took place at a meeting of the Association that was largely attended.
('6', 126, 10, 14, 211406) There was no protest sent to the Association although the election was before the public for a long time.
('6', 126, 11, 15, 211512) 6. As to (b), Mr. Gandhi has received no remuneration for his public work throughout his thirteen years career.
('6', 126, 11, 16, 211624) He has from time to time contributed to the funds of the Association.
('6', 126, 11, 17, 211694) The work has been purely a labour of love.
('6', 126, 11, 18, 211737) His Lordship is further referred to correspondence that took place in The Star of Johannesburg on the 25th October in refutation of a somewhat similar statement made by The Star on the 23rd October.
('6', 126, 12, 19, 211936) 7. As to (c), Mr. Gandhi is totally unaware of any estrangement having taken place between Europeans and Indians by reason of his

('6', 127, 0, 1, 212162) 128 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 127, 1, 2, 212204) advocacy; on the contrary, his supreme effort has been to bring about a reconciliation between the two communities, such being the avowed object of the Natal Indian Congress, of which he was the honorary Secretary and one of the founders, [and] of the British Indian Association of which he is the present Secretary.
('6', 127, 1, 3, 212521) On this point His Lordship is further referred to the following letter from the late Sir John Robinson, which is one among many received from distingu ished residents at the time of his departure for India in 1901:
('6', 127, 2, 4, 212736) I beg to thank you for your kind invitation to the meeting at the Congress Hall this evening (October 15, 1901).
('6', 127, 2, 5, 212849) It would have given me great pleasure to have been present on the occasion of so well earned a mark of respect to our able and distinguished fellow citizen, Mr. Gandhi, but unfortunately my state of health prevents my going out at night, and I am for the present debarred from taking part in any public function, so I must ask you to kindly excuse my inability to attend.Not the less heartily do I wish all success to this public recognition of the good work done and the many services rendered to the community by Mr. Gandhi.
('6', 127, 3, 6, 213376) The chief reason for his having organized the Indian Ambulance Corps at the time of the Boer War 2 and the Indian Stretcher[ Bearer] Corps at the time of the Native Rebellion, was to bring about such [re]conciliation, by showing that British Indians were not unworthy to be citizens of the Empire and were capable of recognizing their obligations if they also insisted on their rights.
('6', 127, 4, 7, 213762) 8. As to (d), it is true that Mr. Gandhi was mobbed on the 13th January, 1897 on his return from India on a misrepresentation about his advocacy of the Natal Indian cause in India.
('6', 127, 4, 8, 213943) Public apology was given to him on the 14th and when the whole of the position became known, the late Mr. Escombe invited him to see him and ever since that time he had the privilege of enjoying the late Mr. Escombes friendship.
('6', 127, 4, 9, 214172) The late Mr. Escombe at his request blessed the leaders of the Natal Indian Ambulance Corps and of his own accord gave them a tea party and made a very eulogistic and public spirited speech on the occasion.3 After the mobbing incident, he remained in Durban up to his return to India in 1901.

('6', 128, 0, 1, 214510) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 129
('6', 128, 1, 2, 214554) 9. As to (e), it is true that Mr. Gandhi is the real proprietor of Indian Opinion from which no profits are made and to which he has devoted the whole of his savings.
('6', 128, 1, 3, 214721) There are two Englishmen associated with him in that work and they and several Indians have, for the sake of the paper, reduced themselves to voluntary pauperism.
('6', 128, 1, 4, 214884) The paper is being run on Tolstoys and Ruskins lines.
('6', 128, 1, 5, 214938) Its publicly declared mission is to bring the two communities together and become an educative medium for the Indian community.
('6', 128, 2, 6, 215066) 10. As to (f) 1 , the terms in which Mr. Abdul Ganie has been spoken of are most derogatory and a product of ignorance.
('6', 128, 2, 7, 215186) He is the managing partner of one of the most flourishing firms of Indian merchants in South Africa.
('6', 128, 2, 8, 215287) Mr. Abdul Ganie has been the unchallen ged President of the Association since its inception.
('6', 128, 2, 9, 215380) He is a resident of the Transvaal of 25 years standing and has come in contact with most of the British officials including High Commissioners and is very well known and is respected by European merchants of standing.
('6', 128, 3, 10, 215598) 11. As to (g) 2 , Mr. Allys whole life in South Africa, that is to say a period of twenty three years, has been devoted to the service of the Empire.
('6', 128, 3, 11, 215748) He had the honour of coming in personal touch with Sir Richard Solomon, the late Lord Loch, the late Lord Rosemead, Dr. Jamieson, Sir Gordon Sprigg, Sir James Sievright and the present officials in the Transvaal.
('6', 128, 3, 12, 215961) He was asked by the Cape Government, at the time of the Malay discontent; regarding the position of a burial ground, to quell the discontent which he was successful in doing and for which he was thanked by the Government.
('6', 128, 3, 13, 216183) This was in 1885; He has had the honour often to speakbeing a voter himself at the Capeon public platforms in support of the British Party candidate as opposed to Bond candidates.
('6', 128, 3, 14, 216363) His free services were utilized by the Uitlander Committee for receiving signatures to the petition that was forwarded to the late Queen in connection with the Uitlander grievances.
('6', 128, 4, 15, 216545) It is untrue that the Hamidia Islamic Society, of which he is the Founder and President, has as its object recognition of the Sultan as the political head of the Moslem world.
('6', 128, 4, 16, 216721) It is formed essentially to help poor Moslems, to defray the expenses of the burials of poor
('6', 128, 5, 17, 216814) 1 This should really be (g).

('6', 129, 1, 2, 217000) Moslems, to do among them the work of social regeneration and to remove their special hardships.
('6', 129, 1, 3, 217097) Sir Richard Solomon, whom Mr. Ally saw on Friday last, has kindly consented that his name might be mentioned to His Lordship as guarantee of his intense loyalty and devotion to the Empire, if such be needed.
('6', 129, 1, 4, 217305) 12. As to (h), the allegation of intimidation is devoid of foundation.
('6', 129, 1, 5, 217376) Poor people, who would be the greatest sufferers under the Ordinance, do not require the slightest encouragement to make an effort for their deliverance from the impending calamity, for such it undoubtedly is to them.
('6', 129, 1, 6, 217594) The Delegates respectfully claim to be the most moderate exponents of the sentiments of over 10,000 Indians in the Colony of the Transvaal.
('6', 129, 1, 7, 217734) It is not possible to give His Lordship an adequate notion of the bitter feeling engendered by the Ordinance.
('6', 129, 1, 8, 217844) Many Europeans, including a government official, were present at the great Mass Meeting, which resolved, without a dissentient voice, to send a deputation.
('6', 129, 1, 9, 218000) The visitors fully realized the depth of feeling to which the community was moved.
('6', 129, 1, 10, 218083) His Lordship is referred for a description of the meeting to The Star, The Leader and The Rand Daily Mail which published fairly full reports of the meeting.
('6', 129, 2, 11, 218241) SUGGESTED EXPLANATION OF PETITIONERS CONDUCT 13. Dr. Godfrey is a hot headed youth, without any experience of practical life in the world.
('6', 129, 2, 12, 218380) He only finished his studies over two years ago.
('6', 129, 2, 13, 218429) He has never before, except in connection with the Asiatic Law Amendment Ordinance, come forward to do public work.
('6', 129, 2, 14, 218545) He himself attended the Mass Meeting and spoke on the principal resolutions, including the resolutions condemning the Ordinance, appointing a commission and advocating going to gaol in preference to the submission to the carrying of passes.
('6', 129, 2, 15, 218786) When the time came for selecting the delegates, he came forward as a candidate but was not selected.
('6', 129, 2, 16, 218887) He sent a telegram at Cape Town wishing success to Mr. Ally and has given him a note of introduction to his wifes parents in Edinburgh, which reads as follows:
('6', 129, 3, 17, 219047) This is to introduce to you one of our best of friends Mr. H. O. Ally.
('6', 129, 3, 18, 219118) He is leaving here to fight the Indian cause and after his battles he will no doubt take a trip to Scotland.
('6', 129, 3, 19, 219227) He will wire by what train he will be coming up and on what date.
('6', 129, 3, 20, 219293) By religion he is an Islam and as such I will write you in detail
('6', 130, 0, 1, 219359) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 131
('6', 130, 1, 2, 219403) as to the modes of their living especially as regards to their food and I hope (after my next weeks letters) you will make him as happy and cheery as you can during his stay in Edinburgh.
('6', 130, 1, 3, 219591) Dont forget to let him have a sight of the glorious F. Bridge and our ain little wee lael home at Tynecastle Terrace.
('6', 130, 1, 4, 219709) John I have no doubt will know Mr. Ally well.
('6', 130, 1, 5, 219755) It is the same who gave him the confetti before he left.
('6', 130, 2, 6, 219812) Yours aff [ectionately,] (signed ) WILLIAM
('6', 130, 3, 7, 219855) The original is hereto attached for His Lordships inspection.
('6', 130, 3, 8, 219917) He was for a long time one of Mr. Gandhis clients and he was associated with Mr. Gandhi in nursing the plague patients in 1904 and at the time did very valuable work for the relief of the patients.
('6', 130, 3, 9, 220115) The only way therefore his conduct can be explained is to ascribe it to his hot headedness.
('6', 130, 3, 10, 220207) The disappointment in this connection seems to have unhinged his mind.
('6', 130, 3, 11, 220278) That appears to be the most charitable constru ction to place upon his conduct, otherwise his strong condemnation of the Ordinance, his strong recommendation to Mr. Ally, would be inconsistent with the despatch of the petition.
('6', 130, 3, 12, 220506) From the following cablegram received by the Delegates and already sent to His Lordship, 1 it would appear that 437 Indian signatures taken on a separate document have been received on false pretences:
('6', 130, 4, 13, 220708) Have affidavits Godfrey obtained signatures blank paper false pretences using
('6', 130, 5, 14, 220786) name bias (code word for British Indian Association) signatures now
('6', 130, 6, 15, 220854) withdrawn cabling (Lord) Elgin papers publish full report conference.
('6', 130, 7, 16, 220924) 14. The Delegates have been obliged painfully and reluctantly to make the above statements, not in the slightest degree with the intention of injuring Dr. Godfrey or his associate and if they have been obliged to say anything regarding themselves, it is from a sense of paramount duty they owe to their countrymen, whose interests they have the honour to represent.
('6', 130, 7, 17, 221290) As the personal element has been introduced here by the petition and in Johannesburg by The Star, it has become necessary to show respectfully to His Lordship that, so far as the personal element is to count in the controversy, the position held by the Delegates, in their humble opinion, would weigh, after the most searching examination in favour of the community.
('6', 130, 8, 18, 221657) 1 Vide Letter to Private Secretary to Lord Elgin, 12 11 1906.
('6', 131, 0, 1, 221719) 132 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 131, 1, 2, 221761) would very much rather that the whole of the Ordinance were examined on its merits and they would therefore respectfully proceed to dwell upon some of the points that arise from His Lordships reply to the Deputation.
('6', 131, 2, 3, 221978) LORD ELGINS REPLY: NO PERMIT UNDER LAW 3 OF 1885
('6', 131, 3, 4, 222027) 15. His Lordship is under the impression that there were permits under the Law 3 of 1885 during the Boer regime and that the Boer administration was lax in the administration of the permit law.
('6', 131, 3, 5, 222221) The Delegates respectfully venture to state that the Boer law did not require any permits at all.
('6', 131, 3, 6, 222319) The receipts given for 3 therefore were not inaccurate.
('6', 131, 3, 7, 222375) They were not permits authorizing entry or residence.
('6', 131, 3, 8, 222429) There was no restriction on immigration contemplated by Law 3 of 1885, as the law itself shows.
('6', 131, 3, 9, 222525) There was therefore no question of identification
('6', 131, 4, 10, 222575) The permits came into vogue only after the introduction of the Peace Preservation Ordinance of the British regime.
('6', 131, 5, 11, 222690) This distinction is very material in order to show that the Asiatic Ordinance, now for consideration before His Lordship, is not an amendment but a new law.
('6', 131, 5, 12, 222847) It does not make accurate that which was inaccurate under the Boer regime.
('6', 131, 5, 13, 222922) It creates a new disability.
('6', 131, 6, 14, 222951) VOLUNTARY THUMB MARKS
('6', 131, 7, 15, 222973) 16. It is respectfully submitted that the voluntary act of the Indian community in putting thumb marks on permits and registra tion certificates was performed gracefully to please Lord Milner and to avoid legislation compelling such performance.
('6', 131, 7, 16, 223219) It is therefore hardly fair to use the act as a precedent against the community.
('6', 131, 8, 17, 223300) NEW REGISTRATION
('6', 131, 9, 18, 223317) 17. The statement that new registration will give a final and indefeasible title to those who are registered is again, in the humble opinion of the Delegates, not in consonance with facts.
('6', 131, 9, 19, 223506) The title of those who hold permits is today indefeasible in law.
('6', 131, 9, 20, 223572) The new Ordinance would actually cancel that title and not give it.
('6', 131, 9, 21, 223640) After dispossessing the community of what it already possesses, it will restore a new title of doubtful value circumscribed by galling require ments and penalties.
('6', 131, 9, 22, 223804) It will, therefore, restore to the community only a part of what will be taken away from it.
('6', 132, 0, 1, 223897) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 133
('6', 132, 1, 2, 223941) INSPECTION
('6', 132, 2, 3, 223952) 18. Under the new Ordinance, it is possible to carry on a daily inspection.
('6', 132, 2, 4, 224028) The assurance given to His Lordship, that the inspection will be yearly, is beside the mark.
('6', 132, 2, 5, 224121) There is no guarantee of the same executive authority remaining in office.
('6', 132, 2, 6, 224196) The experience of the community almost invariably has been that arbitrary power given to the executive in South Africa has been arbitrarily and almost fully exercised against British Indians.
('6', 132, 2, 7, 224388) When a restrictive law is passed against a community labouring under popular prejudice, the executive has been powerless to resist popular demand for full enforcement of restrictions.
('6', 132, 2, 8, 224572) This has happened even with the present executive in respect of Law 3 of 1885 and Peace Preservation Ordinance.
('6', 132, 2, 9, 224684) So much has this been the case that the Indian community has had to go to the Supreme Court in order to resist the attempt of the executive to read into the above laws meanings they are not ordinarily capable of bearing.
('6', 132, 4, 10, 224905) 19. It is for the Indian community a matter almost of life and death.
('6', 132, 4, 11, 224975) It is respectfully urged that the matter can only be properly sifted by a judicial commission.
('6', 132, 4, 12, 225070) If His Lordship is not satisfied as to the full justice of the Indian contention, it is submitted that the decision should be suspended pending the inquiry of a commission.

('6', 139, 2, 3, 231929) The following is a report of the interview between Mr. Morley, Secretary of State for India, and the deputation representing Brittish Indians in South Africa:
('6', 139, 3, 4, 232088) [LONDON, November 22, 1906]
('6', 139, 4, 5, 232116) SIR LEPEL GRIFFIN: I have the honour, sir, to head this deputation today in order to present to you two Delegates from South Africa, Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Ally.
('6', 139, 5, 6, 232274) I would like to say with reference to Mr. Gandhi and a somewhat silly petition which has been sent from South Africa against him and his mission that this was the work of some mischievous schoolboy, and every one who knows Mr. Gandhi, or has been associated with his work for many years, as I have been, knows his single hearted devotion to this particular cause and that without any personal motive or any reward.
('6', 139, 5, 7, 232689) His methods and his motives have been altogether disinterestedto this I can pledge myself.
('6', 139, 6, 8, 232780) One thing that I think I may say without presumption is this.
('6', 139, 6, 9, 232842) No one knows better than you, sir, how strong the feeling of India is on this point.
('6', 139, 6, 10, 232927) It has been brought before the India Office and the Colonial Office by successive Viceroys and Indian Secretaries; and Colonial Secretaries themselves have, in reply to the memorials which I have had the honour myself to submit to them, expressed quite as warm sympathy with the grievances of the British Indians in South Africa as Indian Viceroys or Indian Secretaries at home.
('6', 139, 6, 11, 233306) That point does not require any elaboration: The position between England and her Colonies seems to me very much like that which is now existing between the Central Government of the United States and the State of California, and that position will become aggravated in many parts of the world.
('6', 139, 6, 12, 233601) Hear!) The difficulty of the case is, of Corsica, exceedingly great.
('6', 139, 6, 13, 233670) You have two opposite positions, one represented by the clear and somewhat crude position, which nevertheless has a dignified and a worthy basisthat every British subject under the English flag should be free in his person and to carry on everywhere, without interruption, honourably any occupation he may see fit to undertake.
('6', 139, 6, 14, 233998) Hear!) That applies, sir, to the whole Empire, and it is met on the opposite side by the position, which opposes reduction of the wages of labourso far as white people are concerned, of course, the desire, and the proper desire is that the rate of wages should rise.
('6', 139, 6, 15, 234265) The introduction of a very industrious, temperate class, who can live on very little, tends to lower the rate of earnings of white people who cannot live on so small a sum.
('6', 139, 6, 16, 234438) These are the two opposite poles, and they have to be connected peaceably by some bridge which we ask you, sir, to try and build.
('6', 140, 0, 1, 234568) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 141
('6', 140, 1, 2, 234612) And I would also say, sir, that for two reasons you are the one person who can
('6', 140, 2, 3, 234691) satisfy the claims of this exceedingly complicated case.
('6', 140, 2, 4, 234748) In the first place, you hold
('6', 140, 3, 5, 234777) the keys which shut and which unloose as Secretary of State for India.
('6', 140, 4, 6, 234848) Let me explain in one word.
('6', 140, 4, 7, 234876) Take Natal, for example.
('6', 140, 4, 8, 234901) I have more than once,
('6', 140, 5, 9, 234924) as Chairman of the East India Association, sent petitions to the Secretary of State for
('6', 140, 6, 10, 235012) India, urging that no indentured coolies be allowed to go to Natal until the status of
('6', 140, 7, 11, 235099) their fellow subjects in South Africa is altered.
('6', 140, 7, 12, 235149) Natal cannot get on without the
('6', 140, 8, 13, 235181) Indians, and yet it persecutes them: and it persecuted them in old days much worse
('6', 140, 9, 14, 235264) than the Transvaal did: and their position is no better now, although Natal requires
('6', 140, 10, 15, 235349) Indian coolies every year more and more because English colonists cannot do the
('6', 140, 11, 16, 235429) field work themselves.
('6', 140, 11, 17, 235452) These are not countries which Englishmen can ever colonize.
('6', 140, 12, 18, 235512) That, sir, is all that I think it is necessary to say, but I shall make a final
('6', 140, 13, 19, 235592) personal appeal to you by saying that the other reason why I think you of all men are
('6', 140, 14, 20, 235678) the one who can settle this question is that one of the classics you have given to the
('6', 140, 15, 21, 235765) English people is a work 1 on compromise, in which I have very little doubt that the
('6', 140, 16, 22, 235850) key to this exceedingly complicated question will be found.
('6', 140, 17, 23, 235910) MR. GANDHI: On behalf of my colleague, Mr. Ally and myself, I beg to tender you our respectful thanks for giving to us an opportu nity of placing our position before you, sir.
('6', 140, 17, 24, 236086) But I do not make any apology for trespassing upon your most valuable time, because I think, sir, that we have a right to come to you, our responsible advocate and trustee, whenever we find our interests are in danger.
('6', 140, 17, 25, 236305) The Asiatic Ordinance was, as Sir Lepel Griffin has said, approved by Lord Elgin, I believe, under a misapprehension.
('6', 140, 17, 26, 236423) The Ordinance, in my humble opinion, departs from the Colonial policy hitherto follo wed in connection with Colonial legislation.
('6', 140, 17, 27, 236553) In my humble opinion it is without any justification whatever in that it draws, with reference to free immigrants, a colour line against which Colonial Secretaries as well as Indian Secretaries have repeatedly protested, and protested with success.
('6', 140, 17, 28, 236802) The Ordinance has been described by one of the South African colonists as one which will make us go about the streets with dogs collars, and an indignant Indian at one of the meetings said that the treatment which would be meted out to us would be that, not of the colonial dog because he is a household pet, but of the Indian dog,
('6', 140, 18, 29, 237134) 1 The reference is to Morley's essay, On Compromise.
('6', 141, 0, 1, 237187) 142 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 141, 1, 2, 237229) which is a vile dog.
('6', 141, 1, 3, 237250) I know that that was the bitterness of feeling that was engendered throughout the great mass of my community.
('6', 141, 1, 4, 237360) I cannot help saying, sir, that the feeling that was given vent to by the great meeting at Krugersdorp was fully justified by the experience of British Indians over and over again throughout the Transvaal as well as other parts of South Africa The reasons given for the introduction of the Ordinance have been stated in an inspired article in The Star as well as by Mr. Duncan, viz., that there is an unauthorized influx of Asiatics or British Indians into the Transvaal, and that the British Indian community is countenancing and encouraging such Asiatic influx.
('6', 141, 1, 5, 237924) I think, sir, that that charge, or both of the charges, can be proved to be absolutely false.
('6', 141, 1, 6, 238018) When they talk of an unauthorized influx, they mean that the British Indians enter the Transvaal without any permits, evading the police, and entering surreptitiously in defiance of the Peace Preservation Ordinance, which should regulate the entry of all, but which really regulates the entry of British Indians into the Transvaal.
('6', 141, 1, 7, 238350) The census was taken, and at the time of the census there were found to be 10,000 British Indians as against 12,000 permits, which by itself, in my humble opinion, disposes of the charge of surreptitious entry.
('6', 141, 1, 8, 238561) If that charge is disposed of, it follows that there cannot be any encouragement on the part of the British Indian community.
('6', 141, 2, 9, 238687) There have been during the last two years no less than 150 prosecutionsnamely, 150 British Indians have been turned out by force.
('6', 141, 2, 10, 238817) I do not know whether all these prosecutions were correctly brought, but the fact stands that these Indians were turned out.
('6', 141, 2, 11, 238942) The Peace Preservation Ordinance has been strong enough to prevent Indian wives from accompanying their husbands; it has been strong enough to prevent Indian children of tender age from entering the Transvaal because they did not hold permits.
('6', 141, 2, 12, 239186) The legislation that is at present in existence, the Peace Preservation Ordinance, is quite enough to prevent the surreptitious entry of British Indians.
('6', 141, 2, 13, 239340) Anyhow, both these statements have been repeatedly denied by British Indians, and it is for that reason that we have been asking the local Government to appoint a small commission to inquire whether there has been really any such influx whatever.
('6', 142, 0, 1, 239587) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 143
('6', 142, 1, 2, 239631) I do not think, however, that it is necessary for me to take up a long time; I have sent in a representation to Lord Elgin, which places before him the whole of our position; but I do wish to mention one thing, and that is the colonial feeling.
('6', 142, 1, 3, 239876) I have been studying the history of restrictive legislation throughout South Africaat any rate, during the last thirteen yearsand I well remember that in 1894 Lord Ripon vetoed the Disenfranchising Bill because it applied to Asiatics alone.
('6', 142, 1, 4, 240117) Mr. Chamberlain disapproved of a draft bill that was submitted in 1897 in connection with a restriction on British Indians.
('6', 142, 1, 5, 240241) Mr. Chamberlain then said that he could not allow a colour line to be drawn in legislation with the object of restricting Asiatic and British immigration, and hence we had the law of 1897. A similar veto was applied without the slightest hesitation with reference to the Asiatic Exclusion Bill in the Australian Parliament.
('6', 142, 1, 6, 240565) But, sir, in the Transvaal also only last year, I believe it was, or in 1904the Legislative Council passed the Native Land Tenure Bill, and I think it was passed without a single dissentient; but there was no hesitation whatsoever on the part of Mr. Lyttelton to veto the Land Tenure Bill.
('6', 142, 1, 7, 240855) Now, sir, there is a wide distinction between that Bill and the present Ordinance, and I venture to think that there was not, perhaps, held so strong an objection to that legislation as there is to this legislation, because it did not debar the Natives of the Transvaal from holding landed property.
('6', 142, 1, 8, 241155) It only meant Natives who held landed property; but even that was considered by Mr. Lyttelton as being too strong, and he had no hesitation in vetoing that legislation.
('6', 142, 1, 9, 241324) Much has been said with reference to the colonial sentiment against British Indians; I have no hesitation, sir, strange as it may appear, in denying any such sentiment.
('6', 142, 1, 10, 241493) The proof of the pudding is in the eating. The British Indians live in the Transvaal only because they are tolerated by the white colonists there.
('6', 142, 1, 11, 241640) They may have to go to the British or white landlords for the land; they have to go to the white merchants for their goods, in respect of which they receive six months credit.
('6', 142, 1, 12, 241816) If there was real substantial general opposition against British Indians, I think, sir, that their existence would not be worth a days purchase.
('6', 142, 1, 13, 241961) A meeting was held by the Mayor of Krugersdorp, which was attended by a few white men, who passed a resolution that they would boycott British Indians in connection with land purchase and sale.
('6', 142, 1, 14, 242155) That boycott did not stand for one single day.
('6', 142, 1, 15, 242202) There is only one place throughout the Transvaal where they have tried to boycott with success.
('6', 142, 1, 16, 242298) We think we shall be able to work out our own salvation
('6', 143, 0, 1, 242354) 144 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 143, 1, 2, 242396) if only the prejudice which is restricted to the petty white store keepers who are protected by the Government is removed.
('6', 143, 1, 3, 242519) If this is not done, I can quite understand that our position must become intolerable; but otherwise, I think, sir, that it is possible even now to retain the position that we have in the Transvaal.
('6', 143, 2, 4, 242718) MR. MORLEY: Are you speaking now, Mr. Gandhi, of the position of those
('6', 143, 3, 5, 242789) who are already resident in the Transvaal?
('6', 143, 4, 6, 242832) MR. GANDHI: Yes, sir; the Ordinance applies solely to those who are now resident, and those who are to enter the Transvaal under the Peace Preservation Ordinance.
('6', 143, 4, 7, 242995) I may say with reference to future immigration that my friend, Mr. Ally, will probably deal with that point; and I may parenthetically remark that we have surrendered the whole position, and we have accepted the principle of restriction along the line[s] of the Cape Act, the only Act which, without drawing a colour line, restricts British Indians from entering the Colonies because of the educational testa very severe test.
('6', 143, 4, 8, 243422) But we have thought it wise and prudent that we should accept that position even with reference to trading licenses.
('6', 143, 4, 9, 243539) We have said that we would be quite willing to have our rights with reference to new trading licenses regulated and controlled by the municipal bodies; only such legislation ought also to apply to all, and not only to British Indians.
('6', 143, 4, 10, 243774) My experience is that, wherever legislation is applied to a class of people, such legislation has worked very harshly; but when there is general legislation, such relief is possible to obtain.
('6', 143, 4, 11, 243967) I venture to think, sir, that the Government does not mean to oppress those who are voiceless and voteless.
('6', 143, 4, 12, 244075) I mention this fact not because we want political power.
('6', 143, 4, 13, 244132) We have made it clear that, so far as British Indians are concerned, they do not aspire to any political power at all.
('6', 143, 4, 14, 244251) But if we are to remain voteless, I do think the Government ought to protect those who are voteless, and not merely in a haphazard way, but that protection ought to be a real force, and we look to you, sir, as our advocate and trustee, to give us the protection we are entitled to, and to let us feel that we have it.
('6', 143, 4, 15, 244569) (Applause.)
('6', 143, 5, 16, 244581) MR. ALLY: I do not think it will be necessary for me, sir, to address you at length with regard to our mission.
('6', 143, 5, 17, 244693) Mr. Gandhi has already submitted all the points and the facts.
('6', 143, 5, 18, 244756) I am simply instructed by my community to place before you especially their position in the Transvaal.
('6', 143, 5, 19, 244859) They feeland feel keenlythat the Transvaal administration under the British Government are passing class legislation against
('6', 144, 0, 1, 244984) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 145
('6', 144, 1, 2, 245028) them, whereas thousands of aliens of different races, such as Armenians, Syrians, Greeks, Russians, and Polish Jews, are entering the Transvaal without molestation and without any restriction.
('6', 144, 1, 3, 245221) Our people remember the charter of 1857, as well as the message 1 that the King sent to the Delhi Durbarto the peopleassuring them of their liberties under the British flag; therefore they feel it very keenly that they are oppressed and degraded by the passing of this Ordinance.
('6', 144, 2, 4, 245501) I have spoken to you with regard to the aliens.
('6', 144, 2, 5, 245549) Now the great question is that European feelingthat is, the colonistsis against us.
('6', 144, 2, 6, 245633) The colonists have never asked in any shape or in any way to degrade our people in the Transvaal.
('6', 144, 2, 7, 245731) They have asked for protection against our trade competition, which is very strong against them, and all that they desire, sir, is not to see a great influx of Asiatics in[to] the Transvaal.
('6', 144, 2, 8, 245922) We have from time to time said to the Government that we in the Transvaal are not desirous of seeing a great influx of Asiatics, and Mr. Duncan himself stated that the Imperial Government, with regard to the responsible government of the Transvaal, would deal with that question as well as with that of immigration.
('6', 144, 2, 9, 246238) As we are not represented in the Legislative Council, the Imperial Government is our sole protector.
('6', 144, 2, 10, 246339) Now, just to show you one point how this legislation and this Ordinance were thrust in.
('6', 144, 2, 11, 246427) There was a clause which was unaffected by the new Ordinance, by which the descendants of the Dutch have been excluded from its operations, and yet no provision has been made for the Indian children born in South Africa, even when born in the Transvaal.
('6', 144, 2, 12, 246681) Moreover, I personally pointed out to Mr. Duncan that it was unjust if you were to exclude any Asiatics who were born in South Africa, not to exclude the children of Indians.
('6', 144, 2, 13, 246856) Now, just to show you how unjust it is, even under the Boer Government the Mahommedan subjects of the Sultan of Turkey were also affected by this Ordinance, but not the Christian subjects of the Sultan of Turkey.
('6', 144, 2, 14, 247069) Now you can see how unjust this Ordinance is to Indians.
('6', 144, 3, 15, 247126) I do not think it necessary for me to go to any length, but I would say to you simply this: that the present permits that we hold under the Peace Preservation Act are quite sufficient for identification, and that they can trace any Indians who are in the Transvaal unlawfully without any permission.
('6', 144, 3, 16, 247426) Therefore there is no necessity for them to pass a new Ordinance, or that we should be subjected to this degradation, as we hold these permits at the present time.
('6', 144, 3, 17, 247590) We consider that it is directed against us, and we consider it, sir, an indignity.
('6', 144, 3, 18, 247673) This Ordinance, we consider, is bad in principle, because it would be a precedent to self governing Colonies.
('6', 144, 3, 19, 247783) I would just draw your attention, sir, to the fact that, under the responsible government of the Cape Colony, where I was a resident for thirteen years myself, I had the Parliamentary franchise and the right of holding land and property, and also the right of mining, and there even up to the present moment we have got the same rights.
('6', 144, 3, 20, 248120) Now, under the
('6', 144, 4, 21, 248135) 1 King Edward's message of 1903
('6', 145, 0, 1, 248167) 146 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 145, 1, 2, 248209) Crown Colony, legislation has been contemplated directly against Indians.
('6', 145, 1, 3, 248283) Therefore my Mahommedan community have especially sent me here to put before you the position of the Indians in the Transvaal.
('6', 145, 1, 4, 248410) We have a just right to claim from our Government the same privileges and the same rights as any other British Subjects, unless the British Government are prepared to consent to the millions of Indians who are outside India having no protection.
('6', 145, 1, 5, 248656) If the British Government are prepared to say so, then our people would know better than to get out of India in order to get under the British flag in the Colonies.
('6', 145, 1, 6, 248821) (Applause.)
('6', 145, 2, 7, 248833) MR. H. COX: I would like to make a very few remarks on this question...
('6', 145, 3, 8, 248905) Indian shopkeeper or the Indian trader is more efficient than the white shopkeeper,
('6', 145, 4, 9, 248989) who, by the way, as Mr. Gandhi said, is generally, or often, not a British subject, but
('6', 145, 5, 10, 249077) an alien from Southern Europe or Russia.
('6', 145, 5, 11, 249118) The question, however, that the British
('6', 145, 6, 12, 249158) Government now has to consider is whether to maintain a system of alien white
('6', 145, 7, 13, 249236) shopkeepers as against British subjects.
('6', 145, 7, 14, 249277) That is really the whole point: whether we
('6', 145, 8, 15, 249320) are virtually to subsidize the alien shopkeeper in the Transvaal and to give him a
('6', 145, 9, 16, 249403) preferential right to trade; and in connection with that arises the much larger question
('6', 145, 10, 17, 249492) of the future race destiny of South Africa.
('6', 145, 10, 18, 249536) From an examination of the statistics of
('6', 145, 11, 19, 249577) population in South Africa, and especially of the growth of population, I am
('6', 145, 12, 20, 249654) absolutely convinced that South Africa is not, and never can be, a white mans land.
('6', 145, 13, 21, 249738) The blacks are increasing at an enormously greater rate than the whites.
('6', 145, 13, 22, 249811) It is true that
('6', 145, 14, 23, 249827) in South Africa the white man can live and breed; but that he cannot engage in
('6', 145, 15, 24, 249906) labourers work is admitted on all sides.
('6', 145, 15, 25, 249947) So it has been suggested by several people
('6', 145, 16, 26, 249990) that, because white men will not do manual work, therefore we ought to make special
('6', 145, 17, 27, 250074) provision to allow them to do shopkeeping work.
('6', 145, 17, 28, 250122) Now I think that is an intolerable
('6', 145, 18, 29, 250157) position to take up.
('6', 145, 18, 30, 250178) It is an injustice to the rest of the population as well as to the
('6', 145, 19, 31, 250245) Indians who want to engage in this work.
('6', 145, 19, 32, 250286) Indians are more patient, and succeed better
('6', 145, 20, 33, 250331) with the Natives.
('6', 145, 20, 34, 250349) Moreover, a great many of the white people in South Africa
('6', 145, 21, 35, 250408) welcome these Indian traders, because they find they can get things more cheaply
('6', 145, 22, 36, 250489) from them.
('6', 145, 22, 37, 250500) An English lady told me that her husband objected to her dealing with
('6', 145, 23, 38, 250570) Indian traders, but, nevertheless, she always dealt with them, because she found she
('6', 145, 24, 39, 250655) got things cheaper.
('6', 145, 25, 40, 250675) After all we have got to defend these Colonies.
('6', 145, 25, 41, 250723) We pay for and provide the
('6', 145, 26, 42, 250750) soldiers for the defence of the Transvaal.
('6', 145, 26, 43, 250793) The position is therefore this: that when the
('6', 145, 27, 44, 250839) Transvaal was a foreign country we claimed the right to interfere on behalf of our own
('6', 145, 28, 45, 250926) subjects; now that it is our own Colony, defended by our own troops, we humbly
('6', 145, 29, 46, 251005) withdraw and dare not oppose their will.
('6', 145, 29, 47, 251046) If this is so, we may as well altogether abdi 
('6', 145, 30, 48, 251093) cate our position as an Imperial race.
('6', 146, 0, 1, 251132) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 147
('6', 146, 1, 2, 251176) Then it is, in fact, an alien majority, for not only are the white population mainly Boers, but the immigrant whites are largely aliens.
('6', 146, 1, 3, 251313) Therefore if we assent to this because I consider this, to a large extent, the turning of the wayswe as Englishmen and on behalf of England assent to this proposition that the larger number of the inhabitants of the British Empire are to be regarded as permanently in a lower category than the minority of the British Empire.
('6', 146, 1, 4, 251639) That is a very serious proposition for any British Government, and especially a Liberal Government, to assent to.
('6', 146, 1, 5, 251753) Therefore the particular point I have to submit to you, Mr. Morleyand Sir Lepel Griffin forgot to mention itis this, that before the present Government sanctions any legislation hostile to British Indians they will send to South Africa a commission to inquire into the whole question and to report to them.
('6', 146, 1, 6, 252060) LORD STANLEY OF ALDERLEY: .
('6', 146, 1, 7, 252088) .I may say, personally, that the prayer of the memorial falls very far short of my sense of what the justice of the case requires.
('6', 146, 1, 8, 252219) I feel that in this matter we are face to face with a difficulty which will grow greater and greater unless we lay hold of some principle.
('6', 146, 1, 9, 252358) I fear that too many of the speeches have been rather apologetic than challenging the bad principle itself...Now, I wish to call attention to one passage which puts our case very strongly with reference to the attitude we took up towards the Boers in the settlement at the time of the conquest of the Transvaal.
('6', 146, 1, 10, 252670) I refer to Mr. Chamberlains telegram in 1901 which will be found in Colonial Paper 528, page 5. Mr. Chamberlain then telegraphed that the legal position of Coloured people will be similar to that which they hold in the Cape Colony.
('6', 146, 1, 11, 252902) I do not say for a moment that in the complicated relations of the Crown with its self governing Colonies we could not dream of interfering with the political arrangements and power[s] of a Colony; but I do feel that, so long as Colonies claim the protection of the British flag and the support of the British Empire, we have a right to expect that they will grant civil rights, leaving the question of political rights to the discretion of the Colonies.
('6', 146, 1, 12, 253357) Well now, perhaps, you may say, how do I propose to enforce this in case of a conflict between the central Government and the Colonies? I do not say that you can enforce it.
('6', 146, 1, 13, 253531) These are the problems of intricate relationship with concurrent rights; and though theoretically the Parliament of this country is supreme, practically nobody dreams of this countrys supremacy in face of action by the Colony.
('6', 146, 1, 14, 253758) In the first place, I do not believe that you will come to that point with a Colony.
('6', 146, 1, 15, 253843) But if we can tamper with principle year after year, we encourage a base spirit of race supremacy to assert itself in the Colonies, and you will find it more difficult to tackle it afterwards.
('6', 146, 1, 16, 254036) I may point out that, if the worst came to the worst, no Colony could complain if exactly the same humiliating restrictions were put upon white colonists going to India as they propose to put upon Indians going to the Colony.
('6', 146, 1, 17, 254262) If an Australian merchant, for instance, had to live in a particular district, and had to take out a police license, I think many of them would soon realize that the impediments they are putting on other British subjects were not to be borne.
('6', 146, 1, 18, 254505) I think
('6', 147, 0, 1, 254513) 148 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 147, 1, 2, 254555) this is important..
('6', 147, 1, 3, 254575) .No, I think it is intolerable.
('6', 147, 1, 4, 254607) I think, myself, that, invariably if we go away from principle, we very soon get involved in great difficulties.
('6', 147, 1, 5, 254720) I do not say that you can quite act up to principle.
('6', 147, 1, 6, 254773) I think the English Government cannot: but you should bear the principle in mind and get as near as you can to it.
('6', 147, 2, 7, 254888) I say, in conclusion, that I cannot quite agree with the satisfaction expressed
('6', 147, 3, 8, 254968) by Sir Lepel Griffin with the assurance that we had from the Secretary of State for the
('6', 147, 4, 9, 255056) Colonies.
('6', 147, 4, 10, 255066) Sympathy is a very good thing but effective acts are much better.
('6', 147, 5, 11, 255132) SIR M. M. BHOWNAGGREE: .
('6', 147, 5, 12, 255157) if by your influence, the Cabinet or His Majestys Government were to be induced to veto this Ordinance, which the Delegates have come all this way to complain about, well and good.
('6', 147, 5, 13, 255338) But if His Majestys Government find that, between the prejudice subsisting on the part of so called white men in the Colonies and the rights of the Indians, there is a gulf which they cannot bridge over by their own or your influence, then I beg to support the prayer that a commission may be appointed in order to investigate the whole question and put its conclusions before His Majestys Government....
('6', 147, 5, 14, 255743) I am instructed by the Delegates, and I have the authority almost of the whole of the British Indian community resident in the Transvaal and in Africa generally, to say that they will abide by the findings of such a commission.
('6', 147, 5, 15, 255971) They feel that six, eight, or a dozen impartial English statesmen sitting round a table and inquiring into a deep grievance like this cannot possibly go wrong...
('6', 147, 6, 16, 256133) SIR H. COTTON: .
('6', 147, 6, 17, 256150) .The people of India follow what is going on in South Africa most carefully, and they rely, sir, upon youyou who are the custodian of their liberties and their rights, their sole protector in fact in this countryto see that justice is done to them in whatever part of the globe they may settle..
('6', 147, 7, 18, 256446) SIR LEPEL GRIFFIN: I think, sir, that this will be sufficient....After all, it is a
('6', 147, 8, 19, 256530) question of principle, and that should not be given up.
('6', 147, 8, 20, 256586) Indeed, it has been asserted by
('6', 147, 9, 21, 256618) this Government so strongly in the question of Chinese labour that I think, if the
('6', 147, 10, 22, 256701) question were deliberately laid in its true facts before the present House of Commons,
('6', 147, 11, 23, 256788) that they could, so far as consistency has any meaning, answer it only in one manner.
('6', 147, 12, 24, 256874) MR. MORLEY: ...There can be no doubt whatever, I take iteverybody of Indian experience with whom I speak on the subject agreesthat the effect upon public opinion in India is, and naturally is, and must be, rather serious.
('6', 147, 12, 25, 257096) Those people who go to South Africa come back by and by and represent the indignities to which some of them and their kith and kin have been subjected.
('6', 147, 12, 26, 257248) That in itself stirs up prejudice.
('6', 147, 12, 27, 257283) Often the population in Indiathose who reflectwill ask themselves whether it is want of will or want of power in the British Government to which they submit that leaves them exposed to those disadvantages in a newly acquired possession of the British Crown.
('6', 147, 12, 28, 257541) The irony of the situation of that newly acquired
('6', 148, 0, 1, 257591) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 149
('6', 148, 1, 2, 257635) possession has been pointed out by more than one speaker, and I was very glad indeed that my friend, Lord Stanley, read Mr. Chamberlains telegram of 1901, and that reference has been made to Lord Lansdownes well known speech at Sheffield in the first week or two of the war.
('6', 148, 1, 3, 257910) Mr. Chamberlainto his great honour, be it said throughout the whole time that he was at the Colonial Office urged with all his force the injustice, the harshness, the indignity of proceedings of this kind...
('6', 148, 2, 4, 258118) It is, I repeat, a great irony that one of the first acts to which the eye of the British Government is directed is an Ordinance which, in effectsay what we like about italong with other practices and habits of mind, does throw a bar sinister upon many millions of British subjects.
('6', 148, 3, 5, 258401) I am heartily glad, though a responsible Minister is seldom a man who desires an appeal to principle, that Lord Stanley has gone boldly on to that thorny and difficult ground.
('6', 148, 3, 6, 258577) It is well that we should be reminded that the principles that he alluded to and enforced today have become a little old fashioned; but I share adherence to them entirely with him.
('6', 148, 3, 7, 258758) Hear!) But now we areat least I amin a responsible position, and the question is not what we would desire to do if we had a blank sheet of paper before us; but, as Lord Stanley admitted, we are to keep our principle in mind, and come as near to it as we can in practical applications.
('6', 148, 4, 8, 259043) But, then, what is the position of the India Office?
('6', 148, 4, 9, 259096) Remember that the department and the Minister, first and immediately, and in a sense finally, concerned is the Minister for the Colonies...I see at once, and I submit to you, gentlemen, a very serious difficulty in the way of a commission, and that is that we hope by May that responsible government is going to be conferred on the people of the Transvaal.
('6', 148, 4, 10, 259453) It surely would be a very odd preliminary to putting the reins of government into their hands to send out a commission which, if it is to do anything at all, and, if it is to affect the mind of His Majestys Government here, must force His Majestys Government to tell the new organized authority that is to be brought into being, what they are or are not to do in this very thorny and difficult field of legislation.
('6', 148, 4, 11, 259869) Well, I only submit that as my answer to what Mr. Gandhi and Sir M. M. Bhownaggree said.
('6', 148, 4, 12, 259958) Somebody said, by the way, that a commission would be a solution of the question.
('6', 148, 4, 13, 260040) Now, I have been a great many years in Parliament, and I wonder what commission ever solved any question.
('6', 148, 4, 14, 260146) Therefore, I demur to that general proposition, and I demur to the notion of a commission in the present circumstances because it might lead you into immediate collision with this new authority which you have called, or are about to call, into being.
('6', 148, 5, 15, 260397) No doubt the position of the Imperial Government towards a Colony such as
('6', 148, 6, 16, 260471) the Transvaal is going to be, and such as Natal is, is a great paradox.
('6', 148, 6, 17, 260543) There is no other
('6', 148, 7, 18, 260561) word for it.
('6', 148, 7, 19, 260574) But there it is.
('6', 148, 7, 20, 260591) You have to accept our present system, miscalled an
('6', 149, 0, 1, 260643) 150 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 149, 1, 2, 260685) Imperial system.
('6', 149, 1, 3, 260702) You have to accept that, and you have to recognize this plain fact
('6', 149, 2, 4, 260769) and you ought to recognize itthat we cannot dictate to these Colonies.
('6', 149, 2, 5, 260840) What can we
('6', 149, 3, 6, 260852) do, and what ought we to do?
('6', 149, 3, 7, 260881) What I hope is that such gatherings as this Deputation
('6', 149, 4, 8, 260936) to Lord Elgin and to myself, and perhaps to other Ministers and other persons, will
('6', 149, 5, 9, 261020) promote this operation.
('6', 149, 5, 10, 261044) We can plead and argue the case, and press the principles that
('6', 149, 6, 11, 261107) Lord Stanley has outlined.
('6', 149, 6, 12, 261134) That is what we can do whether in the Colonial
('6', 149, 7, 13, 261181) Conference next year, or in the form of despatches, to Lord Selborne, for instance.
('6', 149, 8, 14, 261265) That is what we can do: we can bring to bear the weight of British opinion and British
('6', 149, 9, 15, 261352) influence upon the responsible bodies in the Transvaal.
('6', 149, 10, 16, 261408) Sir Lepel Griffin noticed that I indicated a little astonishment when he said that I could fasten or unloose these bonds.
('6', 149, 10, 17, 261530) There is not a single Viceroy now living who has not tried, and tried pretty hard, to get these arrangements, the new form of which you are complaining of today, modified.
('6', 149, 10, 18, 261702) What Lord Lansdowne thought of them you have already heard.
('6', 149, 10, 19, 261762) Lord Elgin told you when you saw him that he had sent any number of despatches to this Officeon the way to the Colonial Office, I presumemaking the same protest.
('6', 149, 10, 20, 261924) Lord Curzon, the last Viceroy, carried on a tremendous battle.
('6', 149, 10, 21, 261987) Hear!) I was this morning turning over his speeches, trying to see what he had said or done, and he gives in one of the speecheshis seventh Budget Speechan account of his attempted dealings with the Government of Natalin the year 1903, I think.
('6', 149, 10, 22, 262232) This is what he says.
('6', 149, 10, 23, 262254) It is very short, so I venture to read it.
('6', 149, 10, 24, 262297) We stipulated for the eventual abolition of a tax of 3 a head which had been imposed on such persons for leave to reside; we stipulated for the amendment of an Act placing traders, of however old a standing, under the power of local corporations, who had absolute authority to refuse licenses to trade; we stipulated for the removal of Indians from another Act, under which they were classed with barbarous races; and for the provision of a summary remedy for free Indians, that is to say, Indians who had served their indenture, and had become free Indians, who might be wrongfully arrested on the ground that they were coolies under indenture or prohibited immigrants.
('6', 149, 10, 25, 262968) That was Lord Curzons position dealing with the Government of Natal in 1903. What did the Government of Natal say?
('6', 149, 10, 26, 263083) In reply, says Lord Curzon, we were given to understand that there was no prospect of obtaining the consent of the local legislature to these conditions, and the negotiations were dropped. It would surely be unwise, and I do not think Sir Lepel Griffin would recommend me to put myself (if I had the authority) in a position of that sort, or that I should write to Lord Elgin a communication which would urge him to put himself into the same position with reference to the new Transvaal Government, when it comes into existence as Lord Curzon was placed in by the established Government of Natal.
('6', 150, 0, 1, 263680) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 151
('6', 150, 1, 2, 263724) As I understand from Mr. Gandhiand I was delighted to hear it, and perhaps a little surprised, but delightedthe feeling on the part of the white colonists towards the Indians who are now, and have been for some time, resident in the Transvaal is not bad, but rather good than otherwise.
('6', 150, 2, 3, 264011) MR. GANDHI: The feeling is bad enough, but it is restricted to the petty store keepers.
('6', 150, 2, 4, 264099) It is they who agitate, and they who inflame the popular prejudice.
('6', 150, 3, 5, 264167) MR. MORLEY: I understand that, but we must, after all, look at this thing fairly.
('6', 150, 3, 6, 264249) It is not very unnatural that a small white store keeper should be very happy if he could so far prevail upon the prejudices of the people as to induce those who are in authority to keep out his formidable competitors, because, of course, we know quite wellit is no secretthat it is not merely prejudice of colour; it is not a prejudice of racial inferiority, because that would be absurd when there are, as we know, Indians in the Transvaal, pursuing professions and so forth, who are not only not inferior but greatly superior in many of the elements that make a civilized being to many of those who are not excluded from the Transvaal.
('6', 150, 3, 7, 264888) Hear!)...
('6', 150, 4, 8, 264898) ...If a foreign power were to impose these disabilities upon fellow subjects of ours, I think the Foreign Office would be set in motion to represent such a proceeding as an unfriendly act.
('6', 150, 4, 9, 265087) Hear!) It is a disagreeable truth, but we ought to face these things: that there is no doubt we can more effectively remonstrate with foreign powers than we can in some circumstances with our own kinsfolk.
('6', 150, 4, 10, 265293) (Shame!) But this is carrying me into a very wide field indeed.
('6', 150, 4, 11, 265357) Lord Stanley, I think, rather tempted me into these speculations.
('6', 150, 4, 12, 265423) If there is any feeling in India, that, after all, is the only thing that I can do any good by endeavouring to convey.
('6', 150, 4, 13, 265542) Whatever can be done by way of energetic expression of opinion, of energetic protest, when the time comes, against these harsh and humiliating indignities, you may feel perfectly sure, and they may feel perfectly sure, that this Office will not be at all slack in backing the Colonial Office in any representations that they may wish to make, or possibly even in going a little in front.
('6', 150, 4, 14, 265930) Hear!) Nobody occupying my position could do anything less than promise you, which I do with the greatest sincerity, not only the sympathy of which somebody has spoken today, but as much support as I find myself able to give, now that I am in possession of the general views which you, gentlemen, have so ably laid before me.
('6', 150, 4, 15, 266256) (Applause.)
('6', 150, 5, 16, 266268) SIR LEPEL GRIFFIN: .
('6', 150, 5, 17, 266289) Mr. Morley, I beg on behalf of the deputation to express our best thanks for the very kind and sympathetic manner in which you have 1istened to us for so long, and for the answer which you have given to us.
('6', 150, 5, 18, 266496) The deputation then withdrew.

('6', 151, 2, 3, 266646) [HOTEL CECIL, LONDON,] November 22, 1906 THE EDITOR SOUTH AFRICA [LONDON]
('6', 151, 3, 4, 266720) SIR, You have laid the British Indian Deputation under deep obligation by your opening your columns for a discussion of the British Indian position in the Transvaal and, in the words of Lord Milner, it is such discussion alone which would bring us nearer to a proper solution.
('6', 151, 3, 5, 266997) In your leaderette, however, you have done less than justice to the British Indian community by imputing to it a desire forthe franchise and for an Asiatic invasion of the Transvaal.
('6', 151, 3, 6, 267180) May I state that the community has never desired any political power in the Transvaal or an invasion of it by British Indians, and it is for that reason that it has accepted legislation along the Cape or the Natal model, which restricts the immigration of British Indians (except those who enjoy a status) without insulting them.
('6', 151, 3, 7, 267510) The community has also accepted the principle of the control of all new trade licences, subject to appeal to the Supreme Court, by local boards or municipalities.
('6', 151, 3, 8, 267673) The objection to the Asiatic Law Amendment Ordinance is taken not because the Ordinance is restrictive of immigration, but because it is restrictive of the ordinary civil liberty of the British Indians who are today domiciled in the Transvaal.
('6', 151, 3, 9, 267917) It is not the present Ordinance which would restrict Indian immigration; as you are aware, the Peace Preservation Ordinance has been misapplied for effecting that purpose.
('6', 151, 3, 10, 268089) You say that Indians cannot be treated better than natives of South Africa.
('6', 151, 3, 11, 268165) Without entering into a discussion of the proposition, may I inform you that they are being treated worse than the Natives, in that, whereas Natives can become owners of landed property in any part of the Transvaal, Indians cannot own it at all.

('6', 152, 2, 3, 268531) [HOTEL CECIL, LONDON,] November 22, 1906
('6', 152, 3, 4, 268572) DEAR MR. MORISON, I now enclose herewith a cutting with marked passages, giving the utterances of Lord Selborne.
('6', 152, 3, 5, 268685) One was before the war and the other only lately.
('6', 152, 3, 6, 268735) I also send you copy of Sir Muncherjis letter to Mr. Lyttelton, with the passages marked.
('6', 152, 3, 7, 268825) That we would be satisfied with legislation along the Cape lines is made, you will notice, quite clear in the Representation to Lord Elgin of which you have a copy and of which if you need I will send you more copies.
('6', 152, 3, 8, 269043) I hope you have noticed the fundamental objection to the Asiatic Ordinance, namely, that it draws for 1 the first time a colour line and it means a departure from the Colonial tradition.
('6', 152, 3, 9, 269230) If there was no hesitation last year in vetoing the Native Land TenureBill, it passes comprehension why there should be any hesitation about vetoing this Ordinance which is infinitely worse than the Native Tenure Ordinance.

('6', 153, 1, 5, 270030) Mr. Morley has pledged the deputation to privacy.
('6', 153, 1, 6, 270080) I, therefore, must not give you anything for publication.
('6', 153, 1, 7, 270138) We were very well received.
('6', 153, 1, 8, 270166) Mr. Morley was strong in some parts of his speech but I cannot say that the effect on the whole was encouraging.
('6', 153, 1, 9, 270279) However, we have to wait and see.

('6', 154, 7, 7, 271148) HOTEL CECIL, LONDON, November 23, 1906
('6', 154, 8, 8, 271187) This is our last week here.
('6', 154, 8, 9, 271215) We had hoped to leave on November 24. But we have been obliged to stay on in order to complete the work regarding the Committee and do whatever is necessary after the interview with Mr. Morley.
('6', 154, 8, 10, 271409) Now we have fixed the date of our departure for December 1.
('6', 154, 9, 11, 271469) MORE PROMISES OF HELP
('6', 154, 10, 12, 271491) During the current week, we met Lord Milner, Mr. Lyttelton, Lord Reay, Sir Raymond West and others.
('6', 154, 10, 13, 271591) Everyone has shown much sympathy and offered to work for us.
('6', 154, 10, 14, 271652) It is not possible to say what the outcome of all this will be.
('6', 154, 11, 15, 271716) INTERVIEW WITH SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA
('6', 154, 12, 16, 271760) The deputation met Mr. Morley, the Secretary of State for India, on Thursday at 12.20 p.m.
('6', 154, 12, 17, 271851) Those present were Sir Lepel Griffin, Lord Stanley of Alderley, Sir Charles Dilke, Sir Charles Schwann, Sir William Wedderburn, Sir Henry Cotton, Sir Muncherji Bhownaggree, Dr. Rutherford, Mr. Harold Cox, Mr. A. H. Scott, Mr. Lynch, Mr. F. H. Brown, Mr. J. D. Rees, Mr. Thornton, Mr. Arathoon, Mr. Dadabhai Naoroji, Mr. T. J. Bennett, Mr. Theodore Morison and Mr. Ritch.
('6', 154, 12, 18, 272222) Mr. Ameer Ali could not attend owing to illness.
('6', 154, 12, 19, 272271) Sir Lepel Griffin, Lord Stanley, Mr. Cox and Sir Muncherji spoke at length.
('6', 154, 12, 20, 272347) Lord Stanley
('6', 155, 0, 1, 272360) 156 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 155, 1, 2, 272402) went so far as to demand sweet deeds in place of sweet words.
('6', 155, 1, 3, 272464) Messrs Ally and Gandhi 1 said whatever was required on the occasion.
('6', 155, 2, 4, 272533) MORLEYS SPEECH
('6', 155, 3, 5, 272548) Mr. Morley gave a long reply in which he said:
('6', 155, 4, 6, 272595) I am glad to have met the deputation.
('6', 155, 4, 7, 272633) For I desire to be familiarized fully with the condition of the country for whose administration I am responsible to Parliament.
('6', 155, 4, 8, 272762) Moreover, the problem placed before me today has a very close bearing on the good government of India.
('6', 155, 4, 9, 272865) That the feelings of the people of India are excited on account of the disabilities imposed upon Indians in South Africa is a serious matter.
('6', 155, 4, 10, 273007) Indians returning to their native land from South Africa carry with them the story of the indignities to which they are subjected, and the result is that people are greatly agitated.
('6', 155, 4, 11, 273190) People in India must be thinking that the Government lack either the will or the power to prevent oppression in South Africa.
('6', 155, 4, 12, 273316) In either case, it is harmful.
('6', 155, 4, 13, 273347) I believe the resistance offered by Mr. Chamberlain in 1901, in the interests of Indians, deserves praise.
('6', 155, 4, 14, 273454) The first thing that has been brought to the notice of the new Government is that a bar sinister has been placed upon Indians in some Colonies.
('6', 155, 4, 15, 273598) Men in authority do not like to be told about moral principles.
('6', 155, 4, 16, 273662) But I am glad that Lord Stanley has spoken of moral principles.
('6', 155, 4, 17, 273726) The views expressed by Lord Stanley may be held by some to be old fashioned, but I for one share them entirely.
('6', 155, 4, 18, 273838) Unfortunately, we have not a white sheet of paper to write upon.
('6', 155, 4, 19, 273903) We must face the facts as they are and then act, as far as possible, in accordance with moral principle.
('6', 155, 4, 20, 274008) Now, let us see what the India Office can do.
('6', 155, 4, 21, 274054) It has been recognized by Sir Lepel Griffin that the minister primarily concerned is Lord Elgin.
('6', 155, 4, 22, 274151) Sir Muncherji asks me to demand that a commission be appointed.
('6', 155, 4, 23, 274215) But a serious difficulty in the way is that in May next the Transvaal will be under responsible government.
('6', 155, 4, 24, 274323) Now it would be a serious matter if a conflict arises between the [policies of the] new government and
('6', 155, 5, 25, 274426) 1 In his Gujarati despatches Gandhiji often refers to himself both in the first person and by name.
('6', 156, 0, 1, 274526) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 157
('6', 156, 1, 2, 274570) the commissions recommendations.
('6', 156, 1, 3, 274603) I do not believe that such a commission will solve the question.
('6', 156, 1, 4, 274668) I have been in Parliament for many years but I do not remember any commission which has solved any question.
('6', 156, 1, 5, 274777) And the question regarding the Transvaal is not likely to be solved by the appointment of a commission.
('6', 156, 1, 6, 274881) It will quite probably mean a collision with the newly organized government at the very outset of its career.
('6', 156, 1, 7, 274991) The plain fact is that we cannot dictate to the self governing colonies.
('6', 156, 1, 8, 275064) We can plead, we can argue, we can press for the application of our principles.
('6', 156, 1, 9, 275144) Whether at the Colonial Conference [next year] or in his despatches, Lord Elgin will, doubtless, advance strong arguments and make recommendations.
('6', 156, 1, 10, 275292) Viceroy after Viceroy has written on the matter.
('6', 156, 1, 11, 275341) Lord Curzon had written very strongly.
('6', 156, 1, 12, 275380) He had made many recommendations about Natal but Natal paid no heed to his words.
('6', 156, 1, 13, 275462) It remains to be seen whether the Transvaal will listen to the requests of Lord Elgin.
('6', 156, 1, 14, 275549) I am glad to know that there are many whites in the Transvaal who are not against Indians.
('6', 156, 1, 15, 275640) I can well understand the small white shopkeepers opposing them.
('6', 156, 1, 16, 275705) I can even understand Indians [already in the country] opposing [further immigration of Indians].
('6', 156, 1, 17, 275803) 1 But what I cannot understand is the prejudice felt by the whites against mere dark skin.
('6', 156, 1, 18, 275894) I know that there are in the Transvaal many [Indians] who are superior to the whites.
('6', 156, 1, 19, 275980) How can these then be tyrannized over?
('6', 156, 1, 20, 276019) Just as Lord Lansdownes feelings were hurt by the treatment meted out to Indians, my blood too boils at their sufferings.
('6', 156, 1, 21, 276141) But it must be remembered that we cannot remonstrate as effectively with the Colonies as we can with foreign powers.
('6', 156, 1, 22, 276258) But I have been tempted into a digression by the remarks of Lord Stanley.
('6', 156, 1, 23, 276332) All I can now say is that it is my duty to do all I can.
('6', 156, 1, 24, 276389) The India Office will not fail to make strong representations as frequently as may be necessary.
('6', 156, 1, 25, 276486) I can definitely assure you that I shall not be slack in supporting the Colonial Office and, possibly, going ahead of it.

('6', 157, 1, 2, 276762) MORE INTERVIEWS AND SYMPATHY
('6', 157, 2, 3, 276791) Though Mr. Morley has made such a strong speech, I do not yet expect that the Ordinance will be refused assent.
('6', 157, 2, 4, 276903) Strong despatches seem to have been received from the Transvaal.
('6', 157, 2, 5, 276968) I feel also that the rulers here think in their heart of hearts that we are an inferior race and there is no harm in piling up endless burdens on us.
('6', 157, 2, 6, 277118) Today we saw Mr. Lyttelton and also Sir Raymond West 1, an ex Chief Justice of the Bombay High Court.
('6', 157, 2, 7, 277220) They appeared to be of much the same view.
('6', 157, 2, 8, 277263) They felt much sympathy, but they also indicated that we would get no redress until we acquired strength like the whites.
('6', 157, 2, 9, 277385) They are afraid of the colonies, not because they are white, but because they are powerful.
('6', 157, 2, 10, 277477) If this is a true reading of the situation, we should realize that our salvation lies in our own hands.
('6', 157, 3, 11, 277581) OUR DELIVERANCE
('6', 157, 4, 12, 277597) While we are on this subject, the case of Miss Milne deserves to be noted.
('6', 157, 4, 13, 277672) Miss Milne, a suffragette, began making a speech in front of the Houses of Parliament.
('6', 157, 4, 14, 277759) The police attempted to stop her, but she persisted.
('6', 157, 4, 15, 277812) She was then arrested and prosecuted.
('6', 157, 4, 16, 277850) The Magistrate sentenced her to pay a fine of 10s or imprisonment for seven days.
('6', 157, 4, 17, 277932) The brave lady preferred to go to gaol.
('6', 157, 4, 18, 277972) This will be our last letter from England.
('6', 157, 4, 19, 278015) Hence I would appeal to all and say that, just as Miss Milne preferred going to gaol, so must every Transvaal Indian, taking it that the Ordinance will receive Royal assent.
('6', 157, 4, 20, 278189) There is no doubt that the Fourth Resolution contains the key to the Indians deliverance.
('6', 157, 4, 21, 278279) If the Resolution is acted upon, there should be no anxiety, whether or not the Ordinance receives the assent.

('6', 158, 5, 7, 278812) I have seen in The Times what purports to be a report of the proceedings of the deputation that waited on Mr. John Morley yesterday.
('6', 158, 5, 8, 278945) Several pressmen came to me yesterday and I told them that the proceedings were private and such intimation had appeared in The Daily Mail and The Tribune.

('6', 159, 3, 6, 280038) [HOTEL CECIL, LONDON,] November 24, 1906
('6', 159, 4, 7, 280079) TO THE PRIVATE SECRETARY TO THE RIGHT HONBLE THE EARL OF ELGIN HIS MAJESTYS PRINCIPAL SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES DOWNING STREET LONDON DEAR SIR, I have seen Mr. Churchills reply on the Vrededorp Stands ordinance in answer to Sir Henry Cottons question 2. In my
('6', 159, 5, 8, 280349) 1 This letter along with Sir Henry Cotton's question and Churchill's answer (footnote 2 below) was reproduced in Indian Opinion, 22 12 1906. 2 On November 22, 1906, Sir Henry Cotton had asked the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies in the House of Commons whether his attention had been drawn to Clauses 5, 8 and 9 of the Second Schedule of the Vrededorp Stands Ordinance Of 1906, under which the residence of British Indians, other than domestic servants, was prohibited within that area affected by the Ordinance; and whether, looking to the fact that the Ordinance did not come into effect until it had been assented to by the Crown, and that, for several years past, both under the Boer Government and at present, British Indians had been allowed to occupy land within this area under grants given by the bur ghers of Vre dedor p, and were still residing in this area, and had erected substantial structures thereon, the Secretary of State would advise His Majesty to disallow the Ordinance.
('6', 159, 5, 9, 281351) MR. CHURCHILL: My attention has been drawn to the provision referred to.
('6', 159, 5, 10, 281424) This land was originally granted to poor burghersthat is, to white men onlt, and on condition of personal occupation.
('6', 159, 5, 11, 281542) The Ordinance, therefore, merely perpetuates the legal conditions which were in existence before annexation, and in defiance of which certain Indians have, I understand, acquired some Stands and erected tin shanties.
('6', 159, 5, 12, 281759) I may add that it is very desirable to keep the white and Coloured quarters apart, as the practice of allowing European, Asiatic, and Native families to live side by side in mixed community is fraught with many evils, and is, in Lord Selbornes opinion, injurious to the social well being of all three.
('6', 159, 5, 13, 282061) The whole question is, however, still under consideration.
('6', 160, 0, 1, 282120) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 161
('6', 160, 1, 2, 282164) humble opinion the answer is based on a misapprehension of the real state of affairs.
('6', 160, 2, 3, 282250) The act of granting Vrededorp to the poor Dutch burghers for personal occupation was accompanied by occupation of Vrededorp by persons other than the grantees irrespective of race or colour.
('6', 160, 2, 4, 282441) As for instance, many non Dutch white people occupied Stands in Vrededorp from the original grantees with the knowledge of the Boer Government.
('6', 160, 3, 5, 282585) The Ordinance does not perpetuate the legal conditions which were in existence before annexation, because the legal condition before annexation was that the grantees had only squatters rights.
('6', 160, 3, 6, 282778) The Ordinance now gives to them a permanent tenure with power to them to transfer their leases to whomsoever they choose save and except Asiatics so that the legal condition of personal occupation is now being changed into that of transferable leases.
('6', 160, 4, 7, 283030) I venture to protest against the statement that Indians acquired rights in Vrededorp in defiance of legal conditions.
('6', 160, 4, 8, 283148) They acquired rights in Vrededorp in the same manner that those who were not poor burghers did.
('6', 160, 4, 9, 283244) Nor is it true that Indians have erected shanties in Vrededorp.
('6', 160, 4, 10, 283308) In my humble opinion, class considered, what are descri bed as shanties are superior to many of the buildings in Vrededorp.
('6', 160, 5, 11, 283432) If the doctrine of the desirability of keeping the white and the Coloured quarters apart is sound, I fear that there will be an end to British Indian residence in the Transvaal with any degree of self respect.
('6', 160, 5, 12, 283642) The logical conclusion of such a doctrine will be a system of Locations which can only result in ruination to hundreds of law abiding and respectable Indians.
('6', 160, 6, 13, 283801) One is appalled by the inaccurate information that is placed before His Lordship in connection with matters Indian and it is extremely painful that legislation that is otherwise without the slightest justification is justifiedon statements that are inaccurate or misleading.
('6', 160, 7, 14, 284076) In venturing to offer the above remarks, no reflection is cast on Lord Selborne but it is respectfully submitted that Lord Selborne himself receives misleading information, as is painfully apparent to those who are on the spot and know the inner working of

('6', 165, 8, 13, 290952) From what Mr. Morley stated yesterday there seems to be an impression that the Right Honble gentleman believes that the Indian petition from the Transvaal is in approval of the Ordinance, which is not the case as will appear from the detailed reply 1 the Delegates have submitted to Lord Elgin.
('6', 165, 8, 14, 291247) We now enclose herewith copy thereof.
('6', 165, 8, 15, 291285) With reference to the Royal Commission, what the Delegates have requested is a commission or rather a committeeit may be of local, but independent and impartial men, such as the judges of the Supreme Court or the Chief Magistrate of Johannesburg to enquire into the charges made against the Indian community and

('6', 167, 3, 4, 293132) DEAR MR. MORISON, I hope that you will be able to spare the time for the breakfast on Thursday in respect of which an invitation has been sent to you.
('6', 167, 3, 5, 293283) I have seen the article in The Outlook.
('6', 167, 3, 6, 293323) The whole of it is based on wrong premises and a misunderstanding of the true situation.
('6', 167, 3, 7, 293412) I do not know whether you have also felt it like that.
('6', 167, 3, 8, 293467) If I have the time, I may send a reply.

('6', 168, 3, 4, 294402) DEAR SIR, I am extremely obliged to you for your letter of the 23rd instant.
('6', 168, 3, 5, 294479) I venture to send you herewith a breakfast invitation card as also the draft constitution of the South Africa British Indian Committee.
('6', 168, 3, 6, 294615) If you can join the Committee, your patronage will be valued.
('6', 168, 3, 7, 294677) It was an agreeable surprise to me that you were connected with The Englishman of Calcutta.
('6', 168, 3, 8, 294769) I may state that the late Mr. Saunders rendered the most valuable assistance to me when I was in Calcutta in 1896 and 1901 in connection with British Indians in South Africa; indeed, he even gave me notes of introduction to Sir Charles Turner and others and was largely instrumental in evoking from Lord Curzon a most spirited letter of sympathy regarding the status of British Indians in South Africa.

('6', 168, 9, 14, 295403) DEAR SIR,
('6', 168, 10, 15, 295413) Mr. Ally and I have taken the liberty of sending you today an
('6', 168, 11, 16, 295475) 1 This was sent to the members of the South Africa British Indian Committee.
('6', 169, 0, 1, 295552) 170 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 169, 1, 2, 295594) invitation card for breakfast on Thursday next at 10.30 at Hotel Cecil as a small token of the gratitude of the Indian community, whom we have the honour to represent, for your valuable support and sympathy.
('6', 169, 1, 3, 295802) I trust that you will be able to accept the invitation.
('6', 169, 1, 4, 295858) I am aware that the notice given is very short but as it is imperatively necessary for the Delegates to leave for South Africa next Saturday, we could not give a longer notice.
('6', 169, 1, 5, 296035) I beg to enclose herewith, for your suggestions, the draft constitution of the South Africa British Indian Committee which you have kindly joined.
('6', 169, 1, 6, 296182) After the breakfast is over, it has been suggested that a brief conference should take place in order to consider any suggestions that may be made in connection with the draft.
('6', 169, 1, 7, 296359) As the Committee has been formed in obedience to instructions received from South Africa, the Delegates have taken the liberty of approaching Sir Muncherji for acceptance of the Chairmanship of the sub Committee.
('6', 169, 1, 8, 296572) We have done so because we feel that, among the friends of the cause in London, no one has studied the Indian question in South Africa so well as Sir Muncherji, he having actively interested himself in the cause for the last 12 years and having made a speciality of this question.
('6', 169, 1, 9, 296853) Sir Muncherji has very kindly consented to accept the office if it also meets with the approval of the other members of the sub Committee.
('6', 169, 1, 10, 296992) Lord Reay has been approached with a view to the acceptance of the Presidentship of the Committee and if it is at all possible for His Lordship to accept the office, he will do so.

('6', 169, 6, 15, 297329) At a meeting 1 of the East India Association at Caxton Hall, London, L. W. Ritch read a paper entitled The Burden of the British Indians in South Africa.
('6', 169, 6, 16, 297483) Gandhiji opened the discussion that
('6', 169, 7, 17, 297519) 1 For a report, vide Ritch's Speech at East India Association, before 18 12 1906.

('6', 170, 1, 3, 297655) November 26, 1906
('6', 170, 2, 4, 297673) Mr. Gandhi said that after what had been said by the lecturer it was unnecessary to say anything further with reference to the object of the mission with which he had been entrusted, but it would be ungrateful on his part if he did not take the opportunity of expressing his deep gratitude to the East India Association and its secretary, Mr. G. W. Arathoon, for the advocacy which the Indian cause in South Africa had received.
('6', 170, 2, 5, 298102) There was one thing which all should bear in mind, namely, that whatever difficulties they were undergoing in South Africa were being undergone in the name of the English people [sic], more particularly in the Transvaal.
('6', 170, 2, 6, 298323) The Ordinance which had brought them to England had been introduced in the name of the King.
('6', 170, 3, 7, 298416) For the first time in Colonial history, a precedent had been set by a Crown Colony of legislation which branded a class of people simply because they wore a coloured skin.
('6', 170, 3, 8, 298588) Was India to be retained, or was India to be lost simply because Colonial sentiment had to be consulted?
('6', 170, 3, 9, 298693) What was the proportion of the white population to the Indian?
('6', 170, 4, 10, 298756) Mr. Ritch had said, the Asiatics in the Transvaal were but a drop in the Ocean 13,000 as against 285,000 white men.
('6', 170, 4, 11, 298872) They were simply struggling for peace, for contentment and self respect in that Colony.
('6', 170, 4, 12, 298960) Nearly all of them entered the Colony before the war.
('6', 170, 4, 13, 299014) Today they were merely asking for the civil rights which ought to be granted to everybody who was a subject under the British Crown, and yet under the Ordinance they were to be treated differently to other British subjects.
('6', 170, 4, 14, 299238) Was that kind of legislation to be sanctioned in the name of the British nation?

('6', 172, 3, 4, 301019) MY LORD, Mr. Ally and I have arrived, as perhaps Your Lordship is aware, as a Deputation on behalf of the British Indian community in the Transvaal.
('6', 172, 3, 5, 301168) We have waited on Lord Elgin and Mr. Morley who have given sympathetic answers with reference to our mission but we also feel that any representations that they may make in our behalf require to be considerably strengthened.
('6', 172, 3, 6, 301393) Moreover, the support that we have received from all parties has been exceptionally warm.
('6', 172, 3, 7, 301483) We are most anxious to make as much use as possible of it in our future struggle.
('6', 172, 3, 8, 301565) We have further been instructed by the British Indians in South Africa to form a committee, so that the work now being done may be continued.
('6', 172, 3, 9, 301707) We enclose herewith copy of the constitution.
('6', 172, 3, 10, 301753) We have approached the Right Honble Lord Reay with a view to his acceptance of the Presidentship of the Committee and we believe that, if you could see your way to lend the weight of your influence to the Committee by accepting a Vice Presidentship, he will accept the Presidentship and Your Lordship will lay the Indian community in South Africa under deep obligation to you.
('6', 172, 3, 11, 302130) We beg to enclose herewith an invitation card to a complime ntary breakfast we are giving on Thursday next at 10.30 a.m.

('6', 173, 3, 5, 303102) I have written to Lord Harris and the three other gentlemen in accordance with the enclosed copy.
('6', 173, 3, 6, 303200) 1 The circular letter 2 , of which I sent you a copy, had already gone by the time of the arrival of your letter.
('6', 173, 3, 7, 303314) Mr. Brown has since written saying that perhaps it will be better not to send invitations to The Times or any other paper.
('6', 173, 3, 8, 303437) I will feel very much obliged if you will kindly come on Thursday at 10.30. I do not think I need trouble you tomorrow.
('6', 173, 3, 9, 303557) Mr. Winston Churchill has given us an appointment for tomorrow.
('6', 173, 3, 10, 303621) You will perhaps be going to the Bank tomorrow to give your signature as President of the sub Committee and one of the signatories to the cheques and if at that time it is not too much trouble, you will perhaps drop in at the Hotel.
('6', 173, 3, 11, 303854) We had a very satisfactory interview with the Editor of The Daily News.
('6', 173, 3, 12, 303926) I have not told you all about Mr. Ritchs capabilities.
('6', 173, 3, 13, 303981) He has handled many a meeting and has been secretary of more than one organization.
('6', 173, 3, 14, 304065) He was twenty years ago perhaps what people may call a rabid Socialist.
('6', 173, 3, 15, 304137) His has been a most chequered career.
('6', 173, 3, 16, 304175) Today, I do not own a friend who knows me more than he does.

('6', 176, 7, 8, 307336) OBJECTIONS TO THE VREDEDORP STANDS ORDINANCE 1. The Ordinance if sanctioned will be a precedent for the inclusion of class disqualifying clauses in leases in other townships in Johannesburg or the Transvaal and would therefore go beyond the Law 3 of 1885 in restricting British Indian rights.
('6', 176, 7, 9, 307629) 2. British Indians with the knowledge of the Boer Government occupied and built upon Stands in Vrededorp just as many other Europeans did who were not the original burghers who received, from the late President Kruger, squatters rights on the Stands.
('6', 176, 7, 10, 307880) 3. Vrededorp is contiguous to the Malay Location, which is inhabited by a very large number of British Indians.
('6', 176, 7, 11, 307992) 4. The Ordinance does not perpetuate the legal condition that was in existence before the war but it gives permanent rights to the original burghers with the power to sublet.
('6', 176, 7, 12, 308167) Under this power, Europeans who were not burghers would be able to retain the rights granted to them by the burghers whereas British Indians will be dispossessed without the slightest justification.
('6', 176, 7, 13, 308366) 5. Premises built by British Indians are not shanties but substantial structures as good as most other buildings.
('6', 176, 7, 14, 308480) 6. If the Ordinance is sanctioned, it will be the first instance of a recognition by an Imperial Government of the right of a municipality to curtail the residential rights of British Indians in any part of the Transvaal which, under a Supreme Court judgment, British Indians are entitled to.
('6', 176, 7, 15, 308773) It will indirectly create a system of Locations which otherwise the Imperial Government, it is presumed, would never sanction.

('6', 180, 1, 2, 311911) 175. SPEECH AT LONDON FAREWELL 1
('6', 180, 2, 3, 311944) The following is a report of Gandhijis speech at the farewell breakfast given at Hotel Cecil by the Delegates from the Transvaal to friends and sympathizers:
('6', 180, 3, 4, 312102) [HOTEL CECIL, LONDON, November 29, 1906]
('6', 180, 4, 5, 312143) Sir Muncherji, My Lord and Gentlemen, before I begin to express our thanks for your attendance here and to those gentlemen who have not been able to attend this morning, I shall take the opportunity of reading some of the letters 2 which have been received in connection with the invitations.
('6', 180, 4, 6, 312436) The task before my colleagues and myself today is an exceedingly pleasant one to thank you all who have honoured us by your presence, and also to thank those gentlemen who could not be with us this morning.
('6', 180, 4, 7, 312643) Mr. Ally and I, when we came to the end of our mission, thought that the least we could do, as representing the 13,000 British Indians in the Transvaal, was to adopt this tangible method of showing our gratitude.
('6', 180, 4, 8, 312856) The support we have received throughout our stay in England has been very encouraging.
('6', 180, 4, 9, 312943) We have received it from all parties ever since the beginning of our campaign against the deprivation of our civil rights as citizens in this mighty Empire.
('6', 180, 4, 10, 313100) We have appealed to all parties, and all parties have invariably extended their help to us.
('6', 180, 4, 11, 313192) For this we cannot be too grateful, and I think it but right especially to mention the name of the late Sir William Wilson Hunter.
('6', 180, 4, 12, 313323) As far back as 1893, Sir W. W. Hunter received one of the circulars sent out to him from South Africa, and he it was, I think, who first understood the national importance of this question, and ever since that time down to the date of his death, he was always busy
('6', 180, 5, 13, 313588) 1 This function was specially reported for Indian Opinion.
('6', 180, 5, 14, 313647) Among those present were Lord Reay, Sir William Bull, M.P., A. H. Scott, M.P., Sir George Birdwood, Sir Frederick Fryer, Sir Raymond West, Sir M. M. Bhownaggree, Ameer Ali, Theodore Morison, Dr. Josiah Oldfield, Dr. E. P. S. Counsel, C. W. Arathoon, J. H. L. Polak, L. W. Ritch, G. V. Godfrey, J. W. Godfrey, A. Cartwright, F. H. Brown, H. E. A. Cotton, A. H. Gool, T. Ruthnum Pather, S. M. Manga and J. M. Robertson.
('6', 180, 5, 15, 314065) 2 Gandhiji read out letters of good wishes from Sir William Markby, Sir Roper Lethbridge and Sir Charles Schwann.
('6', 180, 5, 16, 314179) He also mentioned similar latters from Sir Henry Cotton, Sir William Wedderburn, T. J. Bennett, Harold Cox and others.
('6', 181, 0, 1, 314298) 182 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 181, 1, 2, 314340) doing something or other to assist the cause of British Indians in South Africa.
('6', 181, 1, 3, 314421) In the columns of The Times and otherwise, he always advocated our cause, and I had a letter from Lady Hunter saying that, even at the time of his death, he had a long contribution in preparation in connection with this matter.
('6', 181, 1, 4, 314649) In 1896, when I was in Calcutta, the late Mr. Saunders also came to the assistance of our cause, as also did The Times of India, which paper has always advocated the cause of the British Indians in South Africa.
('6', 181, 1, 5, 314861) Coming nearer, the East India Association has helped us, and the British Committee of the Indian National Congress has given us valuable assistance.
('6', 181, 1, 6, 315010) It is a matter of regret to both Mr. Ally and myself that we have had to issue this invitation just at the time the Grand Old Man of India, Mr. Dadabhai Naoroji, is leaving this country for the forthcoming session of the Congress.
('6', 181, 1, 7, 315241) To him also we owe a debt of gratitude.
('6', 181, 1, 8, 315281) As I have said, we have appealed to all parties in the House of Commons, and all have helped us.
('6', 181, 1, 9, 315378) I must not fail to mention especially the name of Mr. Scott, who has helped us most sympatheti cally and most energetically in connection with our grievances, and now I come to the name of Sir Mancherji Bhownaggree.
('6', 181, 1, 10, 315594) For the last 12 years, he has persistently and with unflagging zeal been advocating the cause of British Indians in South Africa.
('6', 181, 1, 11, 315724) All have helped, but Sir Mancherji has made this cause his own.
('6', 181, 1, 12, 315788) Sir Mancherji has worked as if he were actuated by the same strong convictions and feelings as we ourselves.
('6', 181, 1, 13, 315897) He has felt as no other man has the national importance of the issues involved.
('6', 181, 1, 14, 315977) In the House of Commons, outside the House, in his correspondence, he has always helped and counselled us as to how we were to go to work, and words cannot express our gratitude to him for all he has done for us in South Africa.
('6', 181, 1, 15, 316206) The difficulties in our path have, perhaps, whether this Ordinance be passed or not, only just commenced.
('6', 181, 1, 16, 316312) We, therefore, hope that the support, which all our friends here have hitherto afforded us, will be maintained, because, even if the Ordinance is disallowedas there is some hope it will be there is still a great deal to be done in regard to the general question.
('6', 181, 1, 17, 316575) There is again the Vrededorp Ordinance.
('6', 181, 1, 18, 316615) There is, too, the Natal Municipal Corporations Bill.
('6', 181, 1, 19, 316669) Whatever is done in the Transvaal is likely to be done by the other Colonies.
('6', 181, 1, 20, 316747) Ours has been a policy of the strictest moderation.
('6', 181, 1, 21, 316799) We have always claimed that we have been able to enter into the feelings of our opponents (if one may use that term) in South Africa, and although we have examined the whole question from their standpoint and have always endeavoured to convince those
('6', 182, 0, 1, 317050) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 183
('6', 182, 1, 2, 317094) who are prejudiced against us of our desire to be moderate, we have still to ask you to extend your support to us in our struggle, and it is for this reason that we have been authorized by the British Indians in South Africa to organize and inaugurate such a committee as will always watch over our interests.
('6', 182, 1, 3, 317404) The work that has been so well and ably performed here by our supporters will have been frittered away if it be not now concentrated and continued by means of such an organization as thisCommittee.
('6', 182, 1, 4, 317602) As most of you gentlemen have received copies of the circular 1 , I will only recapitulate the objects of the Committee.
('6', 182, 1, 5, 317723) You will notice that it is merely a provisional draft.
('6', 182, 1, 6, 317778) These are the ideas as they strike us, and we hope that you will consider them, and help us by your counsels.
('6', 182, 1, 7, 317888) All whose names are printed on the draft have kindly consented to become members of the Committee, and it now only remains for me to ask you kindly to consider the draft constitution, and to formally inaugurate it, if you think that the step we have ventured to take is acceptable to you.
('6', 182, 1, 8, 318177) I cannot better illustrate the gravity of the position in which we are placed in the Transvaal than by pointing to the young British Indians who are here today.
('6', 182, 1, 9, 318338) They are more your hosts than guests.
('6', 182, 1, 10, 318376) They are Indian students who belong to South Africa, that is to say, South Africa is more their home than India itself.
('6', 182, 1, 11, 318496) They are studying here, but I have no doubt they are looking forward to their return to South Africa with considerable anxiety and apprehension, because they will have to share the same fate as the thirteen thousand British Indians in the Transvaal, and in fact all the British Indians in South Africa.
('6', 182, 1, 12, 318799) Here, in England, they will become barristers or doctors, but there, in South Africa, they may not even be able to cross the border of the Transvaal.

('6', 183, 0, 1, 319166) 184 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 183, 1, 2, 319208) of repeating our thanks for your noble and inspiring utterances at the breakfast today?
('6', 183, 1, 3, 319296) I know that we will have the benefit of your support and advice in our struggle for existence.
('6', 183, 1, 4, 319391) The thought that so many distinguished men are heart and soul with us buoys us up and enables us to hope for better things though the cloud seems to be the blackest.
('6', 183, 2, 5, 319557) I remain,

('6', 186, 3, 5, 323039) The Bedford County School wont havehim by reason of his being overage.
('6', 186, 3, 6, 323110) I have had no time to look up any other institution.
('6', 186, 3, 7, 323163) He must leave India House at the earliest opportunity.
('6', 186, 3, 8, 323218) If therefore the Van Weenens are prepared still to accept him, will you kindly arrange so that Ruthnum can leave for Westcliffe on Monday?
('6', 186, 3, 9, 323357) I would like Miss Weenen to give him all the education she is capable of giving him.
('6', 186, 3, 10, 323442) Perhaps she can also secure a private tutor or admission for him to a school or class in Westcliffe.
('6', 186, 3, 11, 323543) Under the above proposal, Ruthnum Pather need not take out a railway season ticket as he would be going to town only six days every term.
('6', 186, 3, 12, 323681) I would like Miss Weenen to treat him as a member of the family, to be perfectly frank and open with him and never to hesitate to point out to Ruthnum his defects either in speech, in manner or in mode of living.
('6', 186, 3, 13, 323894) He should in short be treated as a very young lad and receive loving supervision.
('6', 186, 3, 14, 323976) He has in him the making[s] of a very good man if at the impressionable time of his life he receives proper handling.
('6', 186, 3, 15, 324094) You may, if you like, pass on this letter to Miss Van Weenen.
('6', 186, 3, 16, 324156) I am, yours sincerely,

('6', 187, 14, 13, 324887) TO THE EDITOR THE TIMES [LONDON]
('6', 187, 16, 14, 324920) On the eve of the departure of the Indian Deputation from the
('6', 187, 17, 15, 324982) Transvaal, may we trespass upon your courtesy to allow us to offer our thanks to the many supporters of the British Indian cause who have rendered us their valuable assistance in putting our case before the Imperial Government and the British public.
('6', 187, 17, 16, 325233) The unfailing cour tesy we have experienced from gentlemen representing different shades of opinion, from all parties, and from the Press has been a source of keenest satisfaction to us and has inspired us with a new hope.
('6', 187, 17, 17, 325456) Our brief stay in London has prevented us from personally waiting on all whom we should have liked to meet.
('6', 187, 17, 18, 325564) We have, however, received support and sympathy even from them.
('6', 187, 17, 19, 325628) The lesson we have drawn from the above is that we may rely upon the British sense of fair play and justice and that the cause we have the honour to espouse is absolutely just.
('6', 187, 17, 20, 325805) May we restate it in a few words We ask for no political power in the Transvaal.
('6', 187, 17, 21, 325886) We do not strive for unrestricted immigration of British Indians, but we do respectfully and emphatically claim the ordinary rights of citizenship forthose who are

('6', 188, 1, 3, 326539) In short, the British Indians in the Transvaal claim the right to live in the Transvaal with self respect and dignity.
('6', 188, 1, 4, 326658) The Indian community protests against any class distinction being made, and it has exerted itself against the Asiatic Law Amendment Ordinance, because it violates in the most brutal manner the principles above laid down.
('6', 188, 1, 5, 326879) In our humble opinion we feel that if we cannot secure for our countrymen, whom we have the honour to represent, the above measure of recognition, the term British Indian becomes an empty platitude andEmpire ceases to have any meaning for the British Indian.
('6', 188, 1, 6, 327138) In coming to England and laying our case before the Home Govern ment, we have no desire to offer violent opposition to the European Colonists in the Transvaal.
('6', 188, 1, 7, 327298) Ours is wholly a defensive attitude.
('6', 188, 1, 8, 327335) When the local Govern ment, in the name of the people of the Transvaal, sends to the Imperial Government for assent a piece of offensive legislation 1 to protect and accentuate colour prejudice, we are obliged, in self defence, to lay before the same Government the Indian side of the question.
('6', 188, 1, 9, 327630) We are anxious and willing to work out our own salvation by our conduct, and by showing to the Colonists that their interests are also our interests and that our goal is the common advancement of them and us.
('6', 188, 1, 10, 327839) We cannot do this if we do not get breathing time, by reason of the anti Indian prejudice of the few being crystallized into and receiving the hallmark of legislation under the Kings Sign Manual.

('6', 189, 4, 5, 328416) DEAR SIR, I have been so much over worked night and day that I have not been able before now to submit my promised statement 1 on Natal to His Lordship.
('6', 189, 4, 6, 328569) I allowed it to be crowded out as Mr. Tathams Bill was rejected by the Natal Parliament.
('6', 189, 4, 7, 328658) I have now forwarded to Mr. Ritch, the Secretary of the South Africa British Indian Committee, my statement and asked him to have it typed and then present the original with a typed copy to you for submission to Lord Elgin.

('6', 190, 1, 2, 329110) [ENCLOSURE]
('6', 190, 2, 3, 329122) STATEMENT REGARDING BRITISH INDIAN POSITION IN NATAL1
('6', 190, 3, 4, 329176) 1. I shall venture to deal with only the most important and pressing portion of the question.
('6', 190, 4, 5, 329270) THE IMMIGRATION ACT 2. Under this Act an undoubted injustice is done to British Indian merchants in that they are not allowed to import confidential clerks or domestic servants.
('6', 190, 4, 6, 329448) 3. The result is that a monopoly is created among the few clerks and servants.
('6', 190, 4, 7, 329527) 4. Nor is it possible to command a large supply of confidential clerks from those who are already domiciled in the Colony.
('6', 190, 4, 8, 329650) 5. Confidential clerks as a rule and domestic servants invariably lack ability to satisfy the educational test under the Immigration Act.
('6', 190, 4, 9, 329788) 6. It is not contended that such men should be allowed to possess rights of domicile but it is respectfully submitted that they ought to be allowed to enter the Colony to reside therein temporarily subject to guarantee being given that, at the end of their service with their masters, they should quit the Colony.
('6', 190, 5, 10, 330102) DEALERS LICENSES ACT 7. This Act has caused and continues to cause the gravest mischief.
('6', 190, 5, 11, 330191) British Indian merchants are totally at the mercy of the licensing officers whose decisions are not capable of being reviewed by the Supreme Court.
('6', 190, 5, 12, 330339) 8. Under this Act most respectable Indian merchants of long standing have been deprived of their licences to trade i.e., of their vested rights.
('6', 190, 5, 13, 330484) This happened in the case of Messrs Dada Osman and Hoondamal.
('6', 190, 5, 14, 330546) 9. At one time an arbitrary use of their power by the licensing officers created a scandal.
('6', 190, 5, 15, 330638) Mr. Chamberlain sent a strong despatch and the then ministry in Natal addressed a circular letter 2 to the municipalities of Natal that, unless they exercised reasonably, moderately and with due regard for vested rights, the power given to them, the Act would have to be amended so as to restore the inherent jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.
('6', 190, 6, 16, 330982) 1 This was forwarded by L. W. Ritch to the Private Secretary to Lord Elgin on December 4. 2 Vide Petition to Natal Governor, 31 7 1899.
('6', 191, 0, 1, 331118) 192 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 191, 1, 2, 331160) 10. It is submitted that the right of the Supreme Court to review the decisions of licensing officers should be restored at the earliest opportunity unless the Indian traders are to lose all they have in the Colony.
('6', 191, 1, 3, 331376) 11. The late Mr. Escombe in his latter days deplored the deprivation of the right of approaching the Supreme Court in appeal against decisions of licensing officers.
('6', 191, 2, 4, 331542) MUNICIPALITIES BILL 12. The attempt to deprive the Indian ratepayers of the right to exercise the municipal franchise is held to be totally unjustifiable and wantonly insulting.
('6', 191, 2, 5, 331720) 13. It is debatable whether India possesses representative institutions founded on the Parliamentary franchise.
('6', 191, 2, 6, 331832) But it is not open to question as to the municipal franchise.
('6', 191, 2, 7, 331894) 14. Both the late Sir John Robinson and the late Mr. Escombe said emphatically that the Indian community ought not to be deprived of the municipal franchise.
('6', 191, 3, 8, 332052) 15. The moral effect of sanctioning such legislation will be very serious and the Indians will be further degraded in the estimation of the Colonists.
('6', 191, 4, 9, 332203) CONCLUSION 16. It now only remains for me to add that regarding Natal the remedy is absolutely in the hands of the Imperial Government.
('6', 191, 4, 10, 332339) [The] prosperity of Natal is dependent on a continuance of indentured labour from India.
('6', 191, 4, 11, 332428) Natal cannot be allowed to draw upon India for a supply of indentured labour when she refuses to treat the resident Indian population with justice and decency.

('6', 192, 3, 4, 332807) DEAR PROF.
('6', 192, 3, 5, 332818) GOKHALE, I am on way back to Johannesburg.
('6', 192, 3, 6, 332861) I wrote to you from London.
('6', 192, 3, 7, 332889) 1 Sir Muncherji suggests that there should be in India a separate South Africa British Indian Committee in the same way as in London.
('6', 192, 3, 8, 333023) By this time you probably know all about the London Committee.
('6', 192, 3, 9, 333086) If a committee were formed in India, I have no doubt all parties would unite.
('6', 192, 3, 10, 333164) Mr. Bennett told me that Mr. Fraser of The Times [of India] would help willingly.
('6', 192, 3, 11, 333246) Many members of the Chamber of Commerce too may unite and the Aga Khan will certainly do so.
('6', 192, 3, 12, 333339) If some such organisation be formed, it will do most effective work.
('6', 192, 3, 13, 333408) The importance of the question was fully realized by everyone in London.
('6', 192, 3, 14, 333481) I am aware that Sir Pherozeshaw 2 does not see eye to eye with us in this matter but I venture to think that he is mistaken.
('6', 192, 3, 15, 333606) Anyhow if a committee were formed, even if it did not do much good, it could not do harm.
('6', 192, 3, 16, 333696) In order to have a committee you certainly need some local man with an accurate knowledge of the position in South Africa.
('6', 192, 3, 17, 333819) As to that I can make no suggestion.
('6', 192, 4, 18, 333856) I remain,
('6', 192, 5, 19, 333866) Yours truly, M. K. GANDHI [PS.] Please write to me Box 6522, Johannesburg.

('6', 192, 8, 22, 334050) [Before December 18, 1906] A paper on The Burden of British Indians in South Africa was read by Mr. L. W. Ritch at the Caxton Hall on November 26
('6', 192, 9, 23, 334196) 1 This letter has not been traced.
('6', 192, 9, 24, 334231) 2 Sir Pherozeshah Mehta 3 This was drafted by Gandhiji on board the ship; vide following item, Deputation Notes IV, before 18 12 1906.
('6', 193, 0, 1, 334366) 194 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 193, 1, 2, 334408) last, under the auspices of the East India Association.
('6', 193, 1, 3, 334464) Sir Mun cherjee Bhownaggree was in the chair.
('6', 193, 1, 4, 334510) Among those present were Lord Reay, Sir Raymond West, Sir Frederick Tyler, Sir George Birdwood Mr. Cotton, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Brown, Mr. Morison and Mr. Arathoon.
('6', 193, 1, 5, 334671) Professor Parmanand and Mr. Mukerjee were among the Indians present.
('6', 193, 1, 6, 334740) The speech described in detail the condition [of Indians] all over South Africa.
('6', 193, 1, 7, 334821) As most of the points made by Mr. Ritch are already known to the readers of this journal, I shall not summarize the speech here.
('6', 193, 1, 8, 334950) After Mr. Ritch had read his paper, the chairman called upon Messrs Gandhi and Ally to speak on the subject.
('6', 193, 1, 9, 335059) Mr. Gandhi acknowledged with gratitude the help rendered by the East India Association to the cause of British Indians in South Africa and warned the assembly that, if the new act were passed, the responsibility would lie squarely on every Englishman.
('6', 193, 1, 10, 335311) For, whatever laws were enacted in South Africa they were made in the name of the King Emperor.
('6', 193, 1, 11, 335407) If therefore the British people were at all inclined to do justice to the three hundred millions in India, they should ensure that the hardships of Indians in the Colonies were ended.
('6', 193, 1, 12, 335591) Mr. Ally spoke next and supported Mr. Gandhis argument.
('6', 193, 1, 13, 335647) He pointed out that alien peoples such as Armenians were free to enter the Transvaal, while the Indians were subjected to various kinds of disabili ties.
('6', 193, 1, 14, 335801) This should happen no more.
('6', 193, 1, 15, 335829) Sir Raymond West said that, listening to Mr. Ritchs speech and the information given by the Delegates, he felt ashamed.
('6', 193, 1, 16, 335949) Was the duty of England over once self government had been granted to the Colony?
('6', 193, 1, 17, 336031) If that were so, the term Imperial race ceased to have meaning and should no more be used.
('6', 193, 1, 18, 336122) Self government for a Colony did not give it the right to trample upon the non whites.
('6', 193, 1, 19, 336209) The Indians had a good cause, and with patience they were bound to get their grievances redressed.
('6', 193, 1, 20, 336308) Mr. Thornton pleaded strongly for justice being done to Indians in the Transvaal.
('6', 193, 1, 21, 336390) He said that nothing could be more modest than the demands put forward by them, and they admitted of no dispute.
('6', 193, 1, 22, 336503) Mr. Nusserwanjee Cooper, Editor of The Parsee Chronicle, said that he had travelled in British Guiana and had found the Indians there quite happy.
('6', 193, 1, 23, 336650) They enjoyed all the rights and many of them had risen to high positions.
('6', 193, 1, 24, 336724) The Indians in South Africa should have the same rights and privileges.
('6', 193, 1, 25, 336796) That they had to suffer hardships was gross

('6', 194, 1, 2, 336883) injustice.
('6', 194, 1, 3, 336894) Mr. Wise, a planter from Ceylon, took exception to Mr. Ritchs censure of indentured labour.
('6', 194, 1, 4, 336986) They went there of their own free will, and it was not for others to say anything about it.
('6', 194, 1, 5, 337078) Mr. Wise was followed by Mr. Martin Wood, Sir Leslie Probyn and others.
('6', 194, 1, 6, 337150) Replying to questions, Mr. Ritch said that, if one had to choose between doing the right thing by the Indians and losing the Colonies, it would be any day better to let the Colonies go.
('6', 194, 1, 7, 337336) But to deny justice to the Indians would be a matter of shame to the British people.
('6', 194, 1, 8, 337421) Winding up the discussion, Sir Muncherji said that he had been thinking of the problem for many years and that he could not stand the hardships imposed upon the Indians in South Africa.
('6', 194, 1, 9, 337607) Sir Raymond West had counselled patience, but he himself held there was no longer any room for patience.
('6', 194, 1, 10, 337712) Where was the scope for patience when Indians were actually being deprived of their rights?
('6', 194, 1, 11, 337804) Before the meeting dispersed, a resolution expressing sympathy with the British Indians in South Africa was moved by Miss Winterbottom, the Secretary of the Union of Ethical Societies, and was passed.
('6', 194, 1, 12, 338005) With a vote of thanks to Mr. Ritch, the proceedings came to a close.

('6', 194, 3, 15, 338266) In fact, this note is being written on board the steamer.
('6', 194, 3, 16, 338324) The last week will abide in our memory for ever.
('6', 194, 3, 17, 338373) Every moment strengthened our confidence that the mission on which the Delegates went to England would succeed.
('6', 194, 4, 18, 338485) SECOND MEETING OF M. PS*
('6', 194, 5, 19, 338510) After Mr. Morleys reply, the Members of Parliament became more alert.
('6', 194, 5, 20, 338580) They thought that, if the Royal assent were given to the Ordinance, Englands prestige would suffer.
('6', 194, 5, 21, 338680) They therefore decided to hold another meeting.
('6', 194, 5, 22, 338728) Sir Charles Schwann, Mr. Cox and Mr. Scott busied themselves with this work.
('6', 194, 5, 23, 338805) They asked us to issue circulars for
('6', 195, 0, 1, 338842) 196 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 195, 1, 2, 338884) the meeting.
('6', 195, 1, 3, 338897) These were got ready and despatched overnight.
('6', 195, 1, 4, 338944) The meeting took place on Monday; and the Members resolved to wait upon the Prime Minister and speak to him about the Ordinance.
('6', 195, 1, 5, 339073) A committee was appointed and it met Sir Henry Campbell Bannerman.
('6', 195, 1, 6, 339140) The Prime Minister said that he did not approve of the Ordinance, and that he would speak to Lord Elgin on the matter.
('6', 195, 1, 7, 339259) This provided the first reason for entertaining the hope of which we have spoken.
('6', 195, 2, 8, 339341) INTERVIEW WITH CHURCHILL We met Mr. Winston Churchill at the time fixed by him.
('6', 195, 2, 9, 339421) He spoke nicely.
('6', 195, 2, 10, 339438) He asked both of us whether we were not afraid of res ponsible government in case the Ordinance were refused assent.
('6', 195, 2, 11, 339555) What if a worse act were to be passed by the new Government?
('6', 195, 2, 12, 339616) We replied that we could not imagine an act worse than the present Ordinance, 1
('6', 195, 3, 13, 339696) and that we had asked for refusal of assent leaving the future to take care of itself.
('6', 195, 3, 14, 339783) He then asked us to send him a brief note, covering, say, a foolscap sheet, of all that we had to say on this Ordinance, on the Vrededorp Stands Ordinance and on the question as a whole.
('6', 195, 3, 15, 339970) He would read and consider it.
('6', 195, 3, 16, 340001) Mr. Ally then reminded him that he was the same person who had been present at the Point to receive Mr. Churchill on his return from the war 2. And it was with the same Mr. Churchill that he now pleaded for redress on behalf of the Indian community.
('6', 195, 3, 17, 340251) Mr. Churchill smiled, patted Mr. Ally on the back and said that he would do all he could.
('6', 195, 3, 18, 340341) This answer added to our hopes.
('6', 195, 3, 19, 340373) The brief account asked for by Mr. Churchill has already been sent to him.
('6', 195, 4, 20, 340448) INTERVIEW TO THE DAILY NEWS The name of the Editor is Gardiner.
('6', 195, 4, 21, 340512) When we repeated the whole story for his benefit, he promised to write strongly on the subject, and a poignant article was published the following day.
('6', 195, 5, 22, 340664) PARTY TO WELL WISHERS The Delegates may be said to have done the last bit of their work on the 29th.
('6', 195, 5, 23, 340765) They gave a breakfast at Hotel Cecil to the gentlemen who had helped them.
('6', 195, 5, 24, 340840) At the breakfast, the idea of the Committee was [formally] put forward.
('6', 195, 5, 25, 340912) A fairly large number of persons was present.
('6', 195, 5, 26, 340958) Lord Reay made a very good and powerful speech.
('6', 195, 5, 27, 341006) There were also other effective speeches.
('6', 195, 5, 28, 341048) But as I intend

('6', 196, 2, 3, 341312) DELEGATES FAREWELL LETTER
('6', 196, 3, 4, 341338) The Delegates have sent a letter 1 of thanks to the Press.
('6', 196, 3, 5, 341397) They have said that the Indian community did not want to fight against the Colony, but wished to solve its problems amicably.
('6', 196, 3, 6, 341523) When a blow was directed against the community, it had to use a shield to ward it off.
('6', 196, 3, 7, 341610) The community would, as far as possible, act with due deference to the views of the colonists.
('6', 196, 3, 8, 341705) But at the same time, it would demand that there should be no detraction from the normal rights to which every citizen was entitled.
('6', 196, 4, 9, 341838) SEND OFF
('6', 196, 5, 10, 341847) The Delegates left Waterloo station on December 1. Among those present to see them off were Sir Muncherji Bhownaggree, Mr. J. H. Polak, Mr. Ritch, the two Godfrey brothers, Mr. Suliman Manga, Mr. Mukerji, Mrs. Polak, Miss Smith, Mr. Simmonds, Prof.
('6', 196, 5, 11, 342096) Parmanand and Mr. Ruthnum Pather.
('6', 196, 6, 12, 342130) THANKS FOR HELP
('6', 196, 7, 13, 342146) The names of those among the public men who helped us have already been mentioned and they have been thanked.
('6', 196, 7, 14, 342256) But it remains for us to thank those who helped us without any thought of being publicly known.
('6', 196, 7, 15, 342352) Among them are Mr. Simmonds, Miss Lawson, Mr. George Godfrey, Mr. James Godfrey, Mr. Ritch, Mr. Manilal Mehta, Mr. Adam Gool, Mr. Manga and Mr. Joseph Royeppen.
('6', 196, 7, 16, 342513) Though Mr. Simmonds and Miss Lawson received payment, they did not work merely as wageearners.
('6', 196, 7, 17, 342608) They worked late into the night ungrudg ingly.
('6', 196, 7, 18, 342655) The Godfrey brothers were in attendance everyday and assisted us.
('6', 196, 7, 19, 342721) Gool and Manga, too, came whenever there was need.
('6', 196, 7, 20, 342772) Similarly, Mr. Ruthnum Pather, who is at present studying in England, used to come and help us.
('6', 196, 7, 21, 342868) But for all this help, the work of the M.Ps.
('6', 196, 7, 22, 342913) could not have been carried out as planned.
('6', 196, 7, 23, 342957) The number of notices issued to the M.Ps.
('6', 196, 7, 24, 342999) alone was about 2,000. Anyone can realize the time that must have been taken in sending these out.
('6', 196, 7, 25, 343098) It is superfluous to praise Mr. Ritch.
('6', 196, 7, 26, 343137) His work is well known to the Indian community.
('6', 196, 7, 27, 343185) Parmanand also gave us all the help that was needed.

('6', 197, 1, 3, 343394) As I give an account of it separately, I do not write about it here.
('6', 197, 1, 4, 343463) CABLEGRAM AT MADEIRA Having finished our work, we left by s.
('6', 197, 1, 5, 343524) Briton.
('6', 197, 1, 6, 343532) We received two cablegrams when Briton touched Madeira.
('6', 197, 1, 7, 343588) One was from Mr. Ritch, and the other from Johannesburg.
('6', 197, 1, 8, 343645) Both said that the Ordinance had been refused assent by Lord Elgin.
('6', 197, 1, 9, 343713) This was more than we had hoped for.
('6', 197, 1, 10, 343750) But Gods ways are inscrutable.
('6', 197, 1, 11, 343781) Well directed efforts yield appropriate fruit.
('6', 197, 1, 12, 343828) The case of the Indian community was just, and circumstances turned out to be favourable.
('6', 197, 1, 13, 343918) It is a happy outcome, but we may not exult over it.
('6', 197, 1, 14, 343971) Much of the struggle still lies ahead.
('6', 197, 1, 15, 344010) The Indian community has still to do much of its duty.
('6', 197, 1, 16, 344065) We shall be able to digest our victory only if we prove our worth.
('6', 197, 1, 17, 344132) Otherwise, it will turn out to be poison.
('6', 197, 1, 18, 344174) We shall pursue these reflections later.
('6', 197, 1, 19, 344215) NATAL STRUGGLE Lord Elgin has asked for a written statement 2 about Natal.
('6', 197, 1, 20, 344290) This has been sent to him.
('6', 197, 1, 21, 344317) The result will come to be known in the course of time.
('6', 197, 1, 22, 344373) The Committee that has been set up is left with the work of striving for Natal and Vrededorp.
('6', 197, 1, 23, 344467) It will thus have little respite.

('6', 197, 3, 27, 344726) As it is difficult to write individually to all those who sent these, they beg to acknowledge the messages with thanks.
('6', 197, 3, 28, 344846) It is God who has to be thanked, not the Delegates who have done no more than their duty.

('6', 198, 3, 4, 345359) RESOLUTION 2. 2 This meeting of the British Indians of the Transvaal further tenders its thanks to the several friends in England who have helped the Delegates by their active support, and authorizes the Chairman of the British Indian Association and the Acting Chairman of the Hamidia Islamic Society to write to the gentlemen letters of thanks.
('6', 198, 4, 5, 345706) RESOLUTION 3. This meeting of the British Indians of the Transvaal further places on record the respectful desire of the Indian community to work in co operation with the European colonists and to yield to their wishes in all reasonable ways and trust[s] that they will reciprocate the sentiment by helping the Indian settlers in the Transvaal to live in the Colony with self respect and dignity, and in the enjoyment of those civic rights which all well behaved citizens under civilized government have the right to possess.

('6', 198, 6, 8, 346467) He expressed appreciation of the help rendered by Mr. Ally, and added that they should not be overjoyed at the cancellation of the Ordinance.
('6', 198, 6, 9, 346609) The time had now come for all of them, Hindus and Muslims, to remain united and to carry on a real struggle.
('6', 198, 6, 10, 346718) He emphasized the need for everyone to remain united in all such activity.

('6', 198, 7, 12, 346836) 1 On their return to South Africa, Gandhiji and Ally were given a reception by the British Indian Association at the Hamidia Islamic Society Hall on December 23. In reply to the addresses presented to them and to speeches eulogizing their services, Gandhiji and Ally said, according to Indian Opinion, that their work had only just commenced.
('6', 198, 7, 13, 347179) They had to show to the European Colonists that the Indian claim was just and reasonable and such as no sober Colonist would take exception to.
('6', 198, 7, 14, 347323) 2 This and the following resolution appear to have been drafted by Gandhiji.
('6', 198, 7, 15, 347400) Earlier, the meeting adopted Resolution I congratulating Gandhiji and Ally on the success of their mission.
('6', 198, 7, 16, 347508) All the three resolutions were unanimously passed.

('6', 199, 2, 3, 347642) On December 29, 1906, the Indian community in Verulam presented an address to Gandhiji and H. O. Ally.
('6', 199, 2, 4, 347745) Replying to the address on behalf of Ally, who was not present, and himself, Gandhiji said: December 29, 1906 I thank you for the address of welcome to Mr. Ally and myself.
('6', 199, 2, 5, 347918) I sympathize with the labourers in their hardships.
('6', 199, 2, 6, 347970) We did put up a stiff fight when the [3] tax was imposed on them.
('6', 199, 2, 7, 348036) It is very difficult now to get any redress in the matter.
('6', 199, 2, 8, 348095) We cannot do much about work taken on Sundays.
('6', 199, 2, 9, 348142) As desired by you, I shall convey the message of your address and your thanks to Mr. Ally.

('6', 199, 11, 18, 348547) It has been our practice, during Christmas every year, to take stock of the position of Indians in South Africa.
('6', 199, 11, 19, 348660) On this occasion we are glad to be able to inform our readers of the success achieved by the Deputation in the matter of the Transvaal Ordinance, which is the most important event of the year.
('6', 199, 11, 20, 348853) As a result of Lord Elgin with holding assent to the Ordinance, it is not only the Transvaal Indians
('6', 199, 12, 21, 348954) 1 The Colonial Office Records show that this was the code word used by Gandhiji as Secretary of the Transvaal British Indian Association.

('6', 200, 1, 2, 349135) who have benefited, but the entire Indian community in South Africa.
('6', 200, 1, 3, 349204) The community has gone one step forward.
('6', 200, 1, 4, 349245) The main reason for withholding sanction was, we believe, saving the Indian community from a stigma which the Ordinance was certain to have put on it.
('6', 200, 1, 5, 349396) This means that the Imperial Government will not sanction any law that will apply to the Indians but not to the whites.
('6', 200, 1, 6, 349516) If we are right in assuming this, the Vrededorp Stands Ordinance, which prohibits Indians from holding any leases of Stands in Vrede dorp, should also be refused sanction.
('6', 200, 1, 7, 349688) And the Natal Municipalities Franchise Bill should also be treated likewise.
('6', 200, 1, 8, 349765) The Natal Mercury has, however, drawn a distinction and based on it the demand that, while the Transvaal is still a Crown Colony and so open to interference from the Imperial Government in its legislation, Natal is a self governing Colony and that the Imperial Government should not interfere in its affairs.
('6', 200, 1, 9, 350074) This argument is fallacious; for there is a clause in the Constitution of Natal which requires that all class legislation passed by the Natal parliament should have the approval of theImperial Government before it becomes law.
('6', 200, 1, 10, 350301) If therefore this clause is not a mere show piece but meant really to protect the Indian community, the argument of The Natal Mercury is not valid.
('6', 200, 1, 11, 350449) There is therefore every reason to expect that the Natal Bill too will be vetoed.

('6', 200, 5, 15, 350602) It has come to our notice that, under the Cape Immigration Act, the Cape Indians, while taking out an immigration certificate or permit, furnish their photograph, pay a fee of 1 and, on occasion, give their right and left thumb impressions as well.
('6', 200, 5, 16, 350851) We have also come to know that this has gone on for some time past.
('6', 200, 5, 17, 350919) We are deeply grieved to learn this.
('6', 200, 5, 18, 350956) It not only makes the Indians hang their heads in shame, but, if not stopped, it will have repercussions elsewhere and will harm the cause of the entire Indian community in South Africa.
('6', 200, 5, 19, 351143) It is quite easy to remedy this evil.
('6', 200, 5, 20, 351181) For, as we understand it, it is not done under any properly enacted law; it is the immigration officer who, in consultation with a few Indians, has introduced this system of taking photographs.
('6', 200, 5, 21, 351375) If, therefore, Indians meet the immigration officer, immediate redress may be possible.
('6', 200, 5, 22, 351463) We are anxious to learn that

('6', 201, 1, 2, 351534) effective measures have been taken in this regard without the least delay.
('6', 201, 1, 3, 351609) At one time the Asiatic Officer had introduced a similar regulation in the Transvaal; but it had to be repealed when the Indian community opposed it.
('6', 201, 1, 4, 351759) Moreover, it is found that these certificates will be valid for one year only.
('6', 201, 1, 5, 351838) There is absolutely no reason why they should be so limited.
('6', 201, 1, 6, 351899) To a man who has no knowledge of English but is a resident of the Cape, a permanent certificate should be issued stating that he has a right to return to the Cape.
('6', 201, 1, 7, 352063) We are not prisoners released on parole that our certificates of freedom can be cancelled if we fail to return within a given period.
('6', 201, 1, 8, 352197) The situation in the Cape is believed to be better than that elsewhere.
('6', 201, 1, 9, 352269) We appeal to the Cape leaders to keep up that position by their diligence.

('6', 201, 5, 14, 352597) Gandhiji replied as follows:
('6', 201, 6, 15, 352626) [DURBAN, January 1, 1907] I do not propose to speak at length, as it is already late.
('6', 201, 6, 16, 352712) Both Mr. Ally and myself are very grateful to you for the kind sentiments you have expressed about us.
('6', 201, 6, 17, 352815) Unity is our greatest need here.
('6', 201, 6, 18, 352848) We are sure to obtain our just rights if we stand united and demand them politely but firmly.
('6', 201, 6, 19, 352942) We could not have achieved anything in England but for the help we received from the people there.
('6', 201, 6, 20, 353041) We have seen that British rule is essentially just and we can find redress for our grievances through representations.
('6', 201, 6, 21, 353160) But we should not be elated by our success.
('6', 201, 6, 22, 353204) Our struggle has just begun.
('6', 201, 6, 23, 353233) Now it is up to us to retain the [fruits of] victory.
('6', 201, 6, 24, 353287) We have to explain things to the politicians here.
('6', 201, 6, 25, 353338) Before I conclude, I would appeal to all of you to do your duty, working actively, with body, mind and wealth, for the good of the community.

('6', 202, 2, 3, 353586) On Wednesday, January 2, 1907, a dinner was given in honour of Gandhiji and Ally by Messrs M. C. Comroodeen & Co.
('6', 202, 2, 4, 353700) at their premises in Grey Street, Durban.
('6', 202, 2, 5, 353742) The Manager of the firm spoke on the occasion and Gandhiji and Ally replied.
('6', 202, 2, 6, 353819) The following is a combined report of their speeches:
('6', 202, 3, 7, 353873) [DURBAN, January 2, 1907]
('6', 202, 4, 8, 353899) Messrs Gandhi and Ally each replied, and narrated their work in London.
('6', 202, 4, 9, 353971) During their stay, short as it was, they came in contact with all classes of men from the humblest politician to the highest, including the Premier, and none of them on hearing the case put in such a reasonable light, grudged them their support, no matter what party he belonged to.
('6', 202, 4, 10, 354254) To give some idea, the Delegates stated that 5,000 penny stamps were used for their work in London.
('6', 202, 4, 11, 354354) The Committee that had been formed to watch their affairs was composed of highly influential men, to whom they entrusted their case in South Africa.
('6', 202, 4, 12, 354503) Strong and sincere promises of help had been given by Members of both the Houses of Parliament, who were convinced of the moderation of their demand, and the conciliatory spirit of their case.
('6', 202, 4, 13, 354696) When the Ordinance was introduced, it was passed so hurriedly that all the protests were disregarded, and yet they did not seek any outside interference.
('6', 202, 4, 14, 354850) They took the right course, and the right had prevailed.
('6', 202, 4, 15, 354907) They had high hopes from the work of theCommittee.
('6', 202, 4, 16, 354958) The great organ of public opinion, The Times, in London, had opened its columns to discuss their case, and when the position was explicitly explained and understood, there was only one reply, and that was that their grievance was just, modest, and reasonable to any right thinking human being.
('6', 202, 4, 17, 355252) When they left the English shore, they had strong hopes that redress would not be denied to them: and when, after some days, they reached Madeira they had a cable to say that the Ordinance had been disallowed.
('6', 202, 4, 18, 355462) The Delegates asked the audience to conform to all their responsibilities as citizens, and they had every hope from British justice.
('6', 202, 4, 19, 355595) The struggle had only just begun, but they did not despair of the future.

('6', 202, 7, 22, 355742) A well attended meeting of the Mahomedan Association was held at Durban on Thursday, January 3, 1907, to present an address to Gandhiji and Ally with Osman Ahmed Effendi in the chair.
('6', 202, 7, 23, 355926) Gandhiji replied as follows:

('6', 203, 1, 2, 355997) [DURBAN , January 3, 1907]
('6', 203, 2, 3, 356024) A number of associations have been founded recently.
('6', 203, 2, 4, 356077) If they want to, they can do a great deal for the community.
('6', 203, 2, 5, 356138) The workers in these associations should act as servants of these bodies, not as masters.
('6', 203, 2, 6, 356228) Only so can real service be rendered.
('6', 203, 2, 7, 356266) Also we shall gain much strength and influence if the various associations co operate with one another.
('6', 203, 2, 8, 356370) Moreover, the suggestion made by Mr. Paul about education really deserves consideration.
('6', 203, 2, 9, 356459) He also referred to the land in Phoenix.
('6', 203, 2, 10, 356500) I am glad to say that I do not look upon it as my personal property, but as belonging to the community.
('6', 203, 2, 11, 356604) I am sorry to state that the Government in India is trying to create disunity among Hindus and Muslims there.
('6', 203, 2, 12, 356714) It would like to see us divided as it believes that only thus can British rule in India be perpetuated.
('6', 203, 2, 13, 356818) A cablegram is published in The Advertiser today, which we cannot accept as gen uine.
('6', 203, 2, 14, 356904) It is certainly the Government which sends out these cablegrams and arranges such meetings.
('6', 203, 2, 15, 356996) Many people want to know the main reason of our success [in London].
('6', 203, 2, 16, 357065) It lies in the perfect accord that obtained between Mr. Ally and myself.
('6', 203, 2, 17, 357138) Never were there any differences between us.
('6', 203, 2, 18, 357183) We have been successful only because we acted with love and in concert, like father and son.
('6', 203, 2, 19, 357276) It should be remembered by all that, even though following different relig ions, we remained united in our struggle.
('6', 203, 2, 20, 357393) Secondly, truth andjustice were on our side.
('6', 203, 2, 21, 357438) I believe God is always near me.
('6', 203, 2, 22, 357471) He is never away from me.
('6', 203, 2, 23, 357497) May you also act in this faith.
('6', 203, 2, 24, 357529) Believe that God is near you and always follow the truth.
('6', 203, 2, 25, 357587) This is all I ask of you.

('6', 203, 6, 29, 357687) An address was presented to Gandhiji and Ally by the Mahomedan Association at the Indian Theatre in Victoria Street on Thursday, January 3, 1907. In reply to the address and speeches by Dawad Mahomed, Dada Abdulla and others, Gandhiji and Allyspoke.
('6', 203, 6, 30, 357937) The following is a combined report of their speeches:
('6', 204, 0, 1, 357991) VOL. 6: 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 205
('6', 204, 1, 2, 358034) [DURBAN, January 3, 1907]
('6', 204, 2, 3, 358060) The Delegates spoke, each in their turn, on broad politics, further giving the audience a review of their hard work in England.
('6', 204, 2, 4, 358188) They acknowledged the sterling services and important counsels given to them by Sir M. M. Bhownaggree, who placed his immense influence and long experience at their disposal, as did Mr. Ameer Ali, ex judge of the Calcutta Supreme Court.
('6', 204, 2, 5, 358425) The importance of India as a precious possession of the British Empire, with its 300,000,000 people who form a third part of the King Emperors subjects, played a great part in their success.
('6', 204, 2, 6, 358616) The English audience was, at several meetings, asked whether they would allow the South African colonists to ill treat undeservedly the sons of India, who fought their wars in China, South Africa, Somaliland, Soudan, and the frontiers of India; the people whose loyalty could be gauged by remembering that a handful of white soldiers (about 78,000) was sufficient to guard the 300 millions of fellow subjects in India, and whether they would like the representatives of the 13,000 British Indians of the Transvaal when they went back to India, to tell their kith and kin that the great Emperor who ruled this vast Empire was unable to save them from undue humiliation in South Africa at the hands of narrow minded white colonists?
('6', 204, 2, 7, 359347) The instant reply of the enthusiastic audiences was strongly in the negative.
('6', 204, 3, 8, 359425) Messrs Gandhi and Ally convinced the Indian audience that they had returned with a confident conviction from England that any reasonable and just grievance, when laid with moderation before the English rulers at Home, would not go unredressed; and, in conclusion, asked the members of the community to conform to all the laws and by laws of the Government whether just or unjust, and make themselves good citizens, as in them lay their own salvation.
('6', 204, 3, 9, 359876) They must convince their white neighbours that their presence in South Africa was not unbeneficial to the Colony, and they must work side by side with European colonists, who should always be honoured as the predominant race.

('6', 204, 4, 11, 360130) 200. REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT OF EDUCATION
('6', 204, 5, 12, 360173) In his annual report recently published, the Superintendent of Education in Natal has said that whatever education is given [to Indians] is provided by the Government at its own expense and that the Indian community does nothing in the matter.
('6', 204, 5, 13, 360417) The charge is partly, though not entirely, justified.
('6', 204, 5, 14, 360471) Besides running a Madressa at Umgeni and one or two other private schools, the Indian community makes small occasional contributions towards the education of
('6', 205, 0, 1, 360629) 206 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 205, 1, 2, 360671) Indians.
('6', 205, 1, 3, 360680) Hence we cannot admit the charge of the Superintendent in the form in which he has made it.
('6', 205, 1, 4, 360772) But it will have to be admitted by every Indian to his shame that the charge is on the whole justified.
('6', 205, 1, 5, 360876) Even in the Madressa there is plenty of scope for improvement if only we have the enthusiasm.
('6', 205, 1, 6, 360970) We are firmly of the view that, just as there should be provision in every Madressa for the teaching of Arabic, so should there be provision for secular or practical education, that is, for the teaching of English and Gujarati or any other Indian language.
('6', 205, 1, 7, 361227) Moreover, whatever teaching there is in Arabic is mostly parrot like; in other words, it is learning by rote withoutunderstanding the meaning.
('6', 205, 1, 8, 361370) On this point, we would advise our Muslim brethren to consider the example of Egypt.
('6', 205, 1, 9, 361455) There education is imparted inArabic from childhood, but with comprehension of the meaning, so that all people can speak Arabic and understand what they read from the earliest age.
('6', 205, 1, 10, 361636) This is also true of other education in the Egyptian Madressa.
('6', 205, 1, 11, 361699) If this reform is carried out in every Indian Madressa, many Muslim children will receive some education without difficulty.
('6', 205, 1, 12, 361824) In this matter we cannot but confess that the leaders of thecommunity have remained backward.
('6', 205, 1, 13, 361918) Apart from the Madressa, there is so little by way of other facilities, and the Indian community has been so careless that we must admit whatever charge is made against us on this count.
('6', 205, 1, 14, 362105) It does not become us to pass on the blame to others by saying that the Govern ment does nothing for education.
('6', 205, 1, 15, 362217) It is as much our duty as that of the Government to provide for education.
('6', 205, 1, 16, 362292) If the Government fails in its duty, that is no reason for us to follow suit.
('6', 205, 1, 17, 362370) On the contrary, if the Government does nothing for education, the responsibility of the Indian community becomes all the greater.
('6', 205, 1, 18, 362501) We are therefore constra ined to say that the above charge is quite justified.
('6', 205, 1, 19, 362580) We know that it is easy to be critical but difficult to suggest remedies and apply them.
('6', 205, 1, 20, 362669) But we shall be able to take a step forward only if we admit that we have been guilty.
('6', 205, 1, 21, 362756) Three things are necessary for meeting the problem.
('6', 205, 1, 22, 362808) The first thing is buildings and equipment.
('6', 205, 1, 23, 362852) In this matter, only the well to do can do much.
('6', 205, 1, 24, 362901) The second thing to be done is that, just as the rich ought to contribute money, so also ought educated Indians to place their education at the disposal of the community, free of charge or all but free of charge.
('6', 205, 1, 25, 363114) Making money is not the object of education.
('6', 205, 1, 26, 363159) If the Roman Catholic community is foremost in the world in the matter of
('6', 206, 0, 1, 363233) VOL. 6: 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 207
('6', 206, 1, 2, 363276) education, it is so because it has from the beginning decided that those who are to be engaged in teaching should give their services free, accepting only what is necessary for their maintenance.
('6', 206, 1, 3, 363472) Besides, they are of mature age and unmarried, so that they are able to devote all their time to the single job of teaching.
('6', 206, 1, 4, 363597) We may or may not be able to reach that level, but there is no doubt that we ought to take a lesson from their example.
('6', 206, 1, 5, 363717) Even those who have received but moderate education will do well to think over these suggestions.
('6', 206, 1, 6, 363815) We shall consider later and in detail in what manner educated people can help, easily and without much trouble.
('6', 206, 2, 7, 363927) The third remedy lies in the hands of the parents.
('6', 206, 2, 8, 363978) If among our people the parents had been eager to see their children educated, they would have made the necessary provision somehow, and means would have been found easily enough for the two measures suggested above.
('6', 206, 2, 9, 364195) But Indian parents are backward in this respect, and to us this is a cause of humiliation.
('6', 206, 2, 10, 364286) We cannot find a single period in history when an uneducated people has become prosperous.
('6', 206, 2, 11, 364377) It is not that education has become necessary only in modern times; it has always been so.
('6', 206, 2, 12, 364468) Only the form has changed.
('6', 206, 2, 13, 364495) The kind of education, which we cannot do without now, was not absolutely necessary in olden days.
('6', 206, 2, 14, 364594) We believe that a people without modern education will fall behind in the end; not only that, it would not even be surprising if such a people were destroyed altogether.
('6', 206, 2, 15, 364764) Be that as it may, it is certain that, whatever struggle we put up for our rights, the condition of Indians will never become what it ought to be as long as we remain backward in education.

('6', 206, 6, 19, 365025) Many prominent people who formerly used to ignore the Congress took notice of its session this year.
('6', 206, 6, 20, 365126) The main reason is the great storm that is raging in Bengal at present.
('6', 206, 6, 21, 365198) Reuter has sent long reports to the newspapers here.
('6', 206, 6, 22, 365251) This is the first time that the Congress has received such publicity.
('6', 206, 6, 23, 365321) The session has also produced a great impression this year.

('6', 207, 1, 2, 365511) very forceful and effective.
('6', 207, 1, 3, 365540) His words deserve to be enshrined in our hearts.
('6', 207, 1, 4, 365589) The substance of the address is that India will not prosper until we wake up and become united.
('6', 207, 1, 5, 365685) To put it differently, it means that it lies in our hands to achieve swaraj, to prosper and to preserve the rights we value.
('6', 207, 1, 6, 365810) On an earlier occasion we mentioned Mr. Asquiths reply to the women of Great Britain that, if all of them demanded the franchise, it could not but be granted.
('6', 207, 1, 7, 365969) We must therefore realize that, like us here, people in England too have difficulty in obtaining their rights.
('6', 207, 1, 8, 366080) There, the people can secure their demands with less difficulty.
('6', 207, 1, 9, 366145) That this is so is not because they are white, but because they are firmly united in their demands and, if these are rejected, they can create trouble for the rulers.
('6', 207, 1, 10, 366312) When the South Africa British Indian Committee was formed in England, Dr. Oldfield said that strength and justice were dear to the British people.
('6', 207, 1, 11, 366459) Under British rule, justice is often not to be had without some show of strength, whether of the pen, of the sword, or of money.
('6', 207, 1, 12, 366588) For our part we are to use only the strength that comes from unity and truth.
('6', 207, 1, 13, 366666) That is to say, our bondage in India can cease this day, if all the people unite in their demands and are ready to suffer any hardships that may befall them.
('6', 207, 1, 14, 366824) These thoughts, which relate to India, will also be useful to us here.

('6', 207, 4, 17, 366936) 202. TOBACCO
('6', 207, 5, 18, 366949) We have written now and again in these columns about the harm done by smoking or chewing tobacco.
('6', 207, 5, 19, 367047) The evil effects of tobacco, as our realization of them grows, have alarmed many great men.
('6', 207, 5, 20, 367139) The famous Major General Baden Powell 1 of Mafeking, addressing schoolboys in Liverpool, said that many of the worlds best men were non smokers.
('6', 207, 5, 21, 367284) Basset, the football player, Grace, the cricketeer, Henlane, the great rower, Weston, the walking champion, Tej, the golf star, Taylor, the great hunter, Celloo, the famous hiker, are all of them non smokers.
('6', 207, 5, 22, 367493) When Baden Powells stock of tobacco ran out, the soldiers at Mafeking addicted to tobacco became absolutely useless, for they were helpless if they could not smoke.
('6', 207, 5, 23, 367658) Thus smoking makes of man a slave.
('6', 207, 5, 24, 367693) In England, it is said, addicts to smoking are quite

('6', 208, 1, 2, 367860) indifferent to those around them.
('6', 208, 1, 3, 367894) The evil effects of this habit become really very dangerous when it spreads among juveniles.
('6', 208, 1, 4, 367987) They learn to steal and commit other crimes.
('6', 208, 1, 5, 368032) They deceive their parents and ruin their health.
('6', 208, 1, 6, 368082) They become irritable, and by the time they become adults, they lose their strength of mind.
('6', 208, 1, 7, 368175) The habit of smoking has not spread as much among Indians as among Europeans.
('6', 208, 1, 8, 368253) However, it will be adding to our many ills if educated Indians lose their sanity and take to smoking.

('6', 208, 3, 10, 368397) 203. BOOKS TO BE PUBLISHED
('6', 208, 4, 11, 368424) We intend to publish translations or summaries of Englishbooks which have not yet been translated in India, but which are likely to be of use, more or less, to all Indian readers.
('6', 208, 4, 12, 368604) Considering that a large section of our readers are Muslims, we are thinking of publishing a translation of the celebrated Mr. Justice Ameer Alis book on Islam which came out some time ago.
('6', 208, 4, 13, 368794) Justice Ameer Ali has given us the permission to translate it.
('6', 208, 4, 14, 368857) The consent of the publishers is yet to be had.
('6', 208, 4, 15, 368905) If that also is received and if the idea is favoured by our readers and they are prepared to encourage us, we intend to publish a translation of The Spirit of Islam in book form.
('6', 208, 4, 16, 369084) We must saythat Justice Ameer Alis book has won fame throughout the world and deserves to be read by every Muslim, indeed by every Indian.
('6', 208, 4, 17, 369223) There is much to be learnt from it.
('6', 208, 4, 18, 369259) We shall gratefully bear in mind any suggestions our readers may have to make.
('6', 208, 4, 19, 369338) The suggestions, it is requested, should be brief and legibly written.

('6', 209, 2, 3, 369538) [JOHANNESBURG, About January 5, 1907] The above sums must have already been credited to your account in the statements sent to you.
('6', 209, 2, 4, 369670) Shri Bhabha of Volksrust tells me that you still continue to send the advertisement bill to him.
('6', 209, 2, 5, 369767) He has already paid it and the money also has been credited here.
('6', 209, 2, 6, 369833) Kalyandas is now busy recovering the dues here.
('6', 209, 2, 7, 369881) Many subscribers complain that they do not get Indian Opinion regularly.
('6', 209, 2, 8, 369954) The two enclosed copies were sent in a single wrapper.
('6', 209, 2, 9, 370009) You will notice that the postal stamp on Desais copy has not been defaced.
('6', 209, 2, 10, 370084) You may remove the stamp and use it.
('6', 209, 2, 11, 370121) 2 Kalyandas believes that some of our people there pack the copies and stick the wrappers carelessly, and they therefore fall apart and the papers get lost.
('6', 209, 2, 12, 370278) I am writing to Mr. West also about this.
('6', 209, 2, 13, 370320) We ought to be very careful.
('6', 209, 2, 14, 370349) I think it necessary for someone to supervise the work of wrapping.
('6', 209, 2, 15, 370417) You may discuss this with others there.
('6', 209, 2, 16, 370457) I am going to write about the London Letter.
('6', 209, 2, 17, 370502) I shall write to The Times of India also.
('6', 209, 2, 18, 370544) We are bound by a contract with Reuter for three months, so we can make an alternative arrangement only at the end of the three months.
('6', 209, 2, 19, 370680) I am, however, moving in the matter straightaway.
('6', 209, 2, 20, 370730) Ask Mania 3 to write to me.
('6', 209, 2, 21, 370758) Let me know what he reads under your guidance.
('6', 209, 2, 22, 370805) I sent all the matter I could.
('6', 209, 2, 23, 370836) Let me know whether or not it was enough.
('6', 209, 2, 24, 370878) If you have received anything regarding the translation of Justice Ameer Alis book, send it on to me.

('6', 210, 2, 3, 371690) [JOHANNESBURG, About January 5, 1907 2]
('6', 210, 3, 4, 371730) [MY DEAR CHHAGANLAL,] I see in the list of subscribers sent by you for collection, the name of K. M. Kagdi, Box 296. I remember having sent the name to you, but he tells me that he never received a single copy.
('6', 210, 3, 5, 371941) He clears his box everyday, but does not receive any.
('6', 210, 3, 6, 371995) Will you kindly make enquiries?
('6', 210, 3, 7, 372027) If we have been sending the paper, collection is easy.
('6', 210, 3, 8, 372082) If not, we have to drop this collection.
('6', 210, 3, 9, 372123) You may, however, commence sending the paper from the date of this letter, if it has not been sent before.
('6', 210, 3, 10, 372230) I have looked through the printed list sent by you, and I did not find the name there earlier.
('6', 210, 3, 11, 372325) You should try not to take Manilal from the English desk if possible.
('6', 210, 3, 12, 372395) It is necessary to give him regular training.
('6', 210, 3, 13, 372441) There is a great deal of force in Mr. Wests argument with regard to him.
('6', 210, 4, 14, 372514) From the typewritten office copy: S. N. 6085
('6', 210, 5, 15, 372559) 206. SUPERINTENDENT ALEXANDER
('6', 210, 6, 16, 372589) Mr. Alexander 2, till now the [Police] Superintendent of Durban, has left his post.
('6', 210, 6, 17, 372673) He has received much honour in Durban in recogn ition of his excellent services.
('6', 210, 6, 18, 372754) He was very kind to the Indians.To show the appreciation of the Durban Indian community there is, we hear, a move to present him with an address.
('6', 210, 6, 19, 372900) We would advise that there should be no delay and the matter be taken in hand immedia tely.
('6', 210, 6, 20, 372992) We hope that Mr. Donovan, who has been appointed in Mr. Alexanders place, will continue his policy and deal out justiceimpartially.

('6', 210, 7, 22, 373165) 1 This incomplete letter bears neither a date nor an address.
('6', 210, 7, 23, 373227) From the contents, however, it is clear that it was addressed to Chhaganlal Gandhi.
('6', 210, 7, 24, 373311) It refers to the collection of dues, which was being seriously undertaken at Phoenix about this time.
('6', 210, 7, 25, 373413) Manilal's studies and the collection of dues are discussed in this as well as the preceding letter.
('6', 210, 7, 26, 373513) 2 It was this officer who came to Gandhiji's rescue when in 1897 he was mobbed at Durban.

('6', 211, 2, 3, 373788) The Cape Argus of Cape Town, commenting on the Asiatic Ordinance, suggests that the different governments of South Africa should consult with the Indian leaders with a view to finding a solution of the Indian problem in South Africa.
('6', 211, 2, 4, 374022) 1 It says further that, if this is not done, both Britain and India will probably suffer.
('6', 211, 2, 5, 374112) This is an important suggestion, made as it is for the first time by an English journal.
('6', 211, 2, 6, 374201) If proper steps are immediately taken, it is likely to be acted upon.
('6', 211, 2, 7, 374271) The suggestion shows that the withholding of assent to the Asiatic Ordinance has had a somewhat salutary effect on the mind of the white population all over South Africa.
('6', 211, 2, 8, 374442) We have discussed this matter in greater detail in our English article, and we hope that some good will come of it.

('6', 211, 3, 10, 374599) 208. ETHICAL RELIGION I2
('6', 211, 4, 11, 374624) INTRODUCTION We propose, during the next few weeks, to write a series of articles on this subject for readers of Indian Opinion.
('6', 211, 4, 12, 374753) Hypocrisy has nowadays increased in the world.
('6', 211, 4, 13, 374800) Whatever a mans religion, he thinks only of its outward form and fails in his real duty.
('6', 211, 4, 14, 374889) In our crazy pursuit of wealth, we seldom think of the harm we cause, or are likely
('6', 211, 5, 15, 374973) 1 The Cape Argus, commenting on the situation created by the suspension of the Transvaal Asiatic Law Amendment Ordinance, said: We would have the local Governments everywhere take counsel with the leaders of the Indian community.
('6', 211, 5, 16, 375203) It should be put to these men that they cannot expect white colonists to stand by and see the very texture of the community quickly transformed by an Indian influx; and that some regulations should be arrived at by which undue hardship on the men who are here could be avoided.
('6', 211, 5, 17, 375481) It is by some such compromise only that we can avoid conflict, good for neither Briton nor Indian. Commenting on this in its English editorial columns, Indian Opinion (5 1 1907) described it as A Wise Suggestion and argued that British Indians in South Africa have [always] accepted the principle of restriction of Indian immigration along non racial lines.
('6', 211, 5, 18, 375839) 2 In this and the subsequent seven articles of the same title, Gandhiji summarized, into Gujarati, Ethical religion by William MacIntyre Salter, the founder of the Society for Ethical Culture, Chicago.
('6', 211, 5, 19, 376041) The book, one of a series issued by the Rationalist Press Association, was published in America in March 1889 and later in England in 1905. In the Gujarati series, Gandhiji summarized only eight of the fifteen chapters.

('6', 212, 1, 2, 376304) to cause, to others.
('6', 212, 1, 3, 376325) Women in Europe do not hesitate in the least to wear soft [kid] gloves even though these are made by killing young and tender animals.
('6', 212, 1, 4, 376460) It is known the world over how Mr. Rockefeller, said to be the richest man in the world, violated many rules of morality in amassing his fortune.
('6', 212, 1, 5, 376606) It is because such conditions prevail around them that many people in Europe and America have turned against religion.
('6', 212, 1, 6, 376725) They argue that, if any religion worth the name existed in the world, the inordinate wickedness that is rampant all round would not be there.
('6', 212, 1, 7, 376867) This is a mistaken view.
('6', 212, 1, 8, 376892) As it is common for a workman to quarrel with his tools and not try to look for his own faults, so, instead of thinking of the wickedness in themselves, men brand religion itself as humbug and go on acting and living as they please.
('6', 212, 1, 9, 377125) Observing this trend and fearing that, if all religions are destroyed, a great calamity may befall the world and people may forsake the moral path altogether, many Americans anal Europeans have come forward to try, in a variety of ways, to bring the people back to that path.
('6', 212, 1, 10, 377401) A Society 1 has been founded which has shown, after an investigat ion of all religions, that not only do all of them teach morality but they are based for the most part on; ethical principles; that it is ones duty to obey the laws of ethics whether or not one professes a religion; and that men who would not obey them could do no good either to themselves or to others, in this world or the next.
('6', 212, 1, 11, 377799) The object of these societies is to influence those who have led to look down upon all religions because of the prevailing hypocrisy.
('6', 212, 1, 12, 377933) They find out the fundamentals of all religions, discuss and write about the ethical principles common to them and live up to them.
('6', 212, 1, 13, 378065) This creed they call Ethical Religion.
('6', 212, 1, 14, 378104) It is not among the aims of these societies to criticize any religion.
('6', 212, 1, 15, 378175) Men professing all religions can, and do, join these societies.
('6', 212, 1, 16, 378239) The advantage of such a society is that members adhere to their own faith more strictly and pay greater attention to its moral teaching.
('6', 212, 1, 17, 378376) They firmly believe that man ought to abide by the laws of morality and that if he does not, it mean an end to all order in the world and ultimate destruction.
('6', 212, 1, 18, 378536) Mr Salter, a learned American, has published a book on the subject, which is excellent.
('6', 212, 1, 19, 378624) Though it does not deal with any religion

('6', 213, 1, 3, 378808) We shall publish the substance of these teachings every week.
('6', 213, 1, 4, 378870) All that needs to be said about the author is that he practises whatever he advises others to do.
('6', 213, 1, 5, 378968) We would only appeal to the reader to try to live up to those moral precepts that appeal to him.
('6', 213, 1, 6, 379065) Then only may we regard our efforts as having been fruitful.
('6', 213, 2, 7, 379126) CHAPTER I
('6', 213, 3, 8, 379136) It is the moral nature of man by which he rises to good and noble thoughts.
('6', 213, 3, 9, 379212) The different sciences show us the world as it is.
('6', 213, 3, 10, 379263) Ethics tells us what it ought to be.
('6', 213, 3, 11, 379300) It enables man to know how he should act.
('6', 213, 3, 12, 379342) Man has two windows to his mind: through one he can see his own self as it is; through the other, he can see what it ought to be.
('6', 213, 3, 13, 379472) It is our task to analyse and explore the body, the brain and the mind of man separately; but if we stop here, we derive no benefit despite our scientific knowledge.
('6', 213, 3, 14, 379638) It is necessary to know about the evil effects of injustice, wickedness, vanity and the like, and the disaster they spell where the three are found together.
('6', 213, 3, 15, 379796) And mere knowledge is not enough, it should be followed by appropriate action.
('6', 213, 3, 16, 379875) An ethical idea is like an architects plan.
('6', 213, 3, 17, 379919) The plan shows how the building should be constructed; but it becomes useless if the building is not raised accordingly.
('6', 213, 3, 18, 380040) Similarly, an ethical idea is useless so long as it is not followed by suitable action.
('6', 213, 3, 19, 380128) There are many who memorize moral precepts and preach sermons, but they neither practise them nor do they mean to do so.
('6', 213, 3, 20, 380249) There are some who believe that moral principles are not intended to be practised in this world; they are meant for the other worldthe world which lies beyond death.
('6', 213, 3, 21, 380415) A great thinker has said, If you wish to attain perfection, you must begin from this very day to live according to the laws of morality at any cost. We need not be scared away by such thoughts; on the contrary we should be glad to live up to them, considering our responsibility in the matter.
('6', 213, 3, 22, 380709) Certainly, cousin, said the gallant Earl of Pembroke, on coming up to the Earl of Derby before Aubercoche and finding the battle already won, you have neither been courteous nor behaved honour ably to fight my enemies without waiting for me, seeing that you had sent for me.
('6', 213, 3, 23, 380984) Only when there is such readiness to accept moral responsibility will men tread the path of virtue.
('6', 213, 3, 24, 381084) God is omnipotent, He is perfect.
('6', 213, 3, 25, 381118) There are no limits to His mercy, to His goodness and to His justice.
('6', 213, 3, 26, 381188) If this is so, how can we, His bond slaves, stray at all from the moral path?
('6', 213, 3, 27, 381266) It is no fault of the
('6', 214, 0, 1, 381288) VOL. 6: 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 215
('6', 214, 1, 2, 381331) ethical principles if one following them should fail.
('6', 214, 1, 3, 381385) However, those committing a breach of morality have only themselves to blame.
('6', 214, 1, 4, 381463) In the path of morality there is no such thing as reward for moral behaviour.
('6', 214, 1, 5, 381541) If a man does some good deed, he does not do it to win applause, he does it because he must.
('6', 214, 1, 6, 381634) For him doing good is but a higher kind of food, if one may compare food and goodness.
('6', 214, 1, 7, 381721) And if someone should give him an opportunity to do a good deed, he would feel grateful just as a starving man would be grateful to the giver of food and bless him.
('6', 214, 1, 8, 381886) This ethical religion, of which we have spoken, does not mean the cultivation of gentlemanliness.
('6', 214, 1, 9, 381984) It does mean that we should become a little more diligent, a little better educated, a little cleaner and neater, etc.
('6', 214, 1, 10, 382103) All this is no doubt included in it, but it touches only the fringe of ethical religion.
('6', 214, 1, 11, 382192) Many more things have to be done by man if he would walk along this path; and he has to do them as a matter of duty, knowing them to be a part of his nature, not for gaining any worldly benefit.

('6', 216, 2, 3, 384491) [JOHANNESBURG Before January 12, 1907]
('6', 216, 3, 4, 384530) [TO THE EDITOR
('6', 216, 4, 5, 384545) THE OUTLOOK
('6', 216, 5, 6, 384557) SIR,] May I congratulate you on having recognized by your exhaustive leader on British Indians in the Transvaal in your issue of November 24 the Imperial importance of the question?
('6', 216, 5, 7, 384739) And may I, at the same time, point out that you have, in justifying the anti Indian policy of the Europeans, done, no doubt unconsciously, an injustice to British Indians in a twofold manner?
('6', 216, 5, 8, 384931) First, in my humble opinion, you have missed the central question.
('6', 216, 5, 9, 384998) You seem to think that Indians on the one hand demand an open door for an unrestricted influx of their countrymen, and that the white colonists on the other, from an instinct of self preservation, demand that the door should be tightly closed.
('6', 216, 5, 10, 385242) Such, however, is not the case.
('6', 216, 5, 11, 385274) Indians ask for the ordinary civil rights enjoyed by all human beings, except criminals, in any civilized state.
('6', 216, 5, 12, 385387) They admit the principle of restriction of further immi gration of their brethren along the lines even as adopted by Aust ralia, but they say, with Mr. Chamberlain that they may not be restricted solely because theyare British Indians.
('6', 216, 5, 13, 385623) If Imperia lism has any meaning, how can any exception be taken to a position such as above?
('6', 216, 5, 14, 385716) I have no doubt that you, sir, will admit that even a self governing colony, so long as it chooses to remain a part of the Empire, may not go so far as to degrade and ill treat those whom it finds settled within its borders on assumption of self governing powers.
('6', 216, 5, 15, 385980) Secondly, you talk of the necessity of sacrifice of a principle of logic (as you are pleased to term it) to the principle of high expediency.
('6', 216, 5, 16, 386122) To me, it is not logic so much as morality you would sacrifice on the altar of expediency; but assuming that a logical or a moral principle may be so sacrificed, what is higher expediency?
('6', 216, 5, 17, 386311) It is a wanton wounding of the susceptibilities of a finely strung and highly loyal community like the millions of India, or a firm refusal on the part of the Imperial watchdog sitting, inLord Milners language,
('6', 217, 0, 1, 386522) 218 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 217, 1, 2, 386564) on the watch tower, and sweeping the whole horizon before him to protect an unreasoning and unreasonable colour prejudice.
('6', 217, 1, 3, 386687) You incidentally mention the Treaty of Vereeniging 1. May I draw your attention to the fact that, even if the term Native as used there were to include British Indians, it merely suspends a considera tion of the granting of the political franchise to the Natives until after the establishment of responsible government in the Colony.
('6', 217, 1, 4, 387021) British Indians have, however, in unmistakable language stated that they do not aspire, at any rate at the present stage, to political power.
('6', 217, 2, 5, 387163) Indian Opinion, 12 1 1907
('6', 217, 4, 6, 387189) Yours, etc., M. K. GANDHI
('6', 217, 5, 7, 387215) 212. QUINNS SPEECH
('6', 217, 6, 8, 387234) Mr. Quinns speech, as reported by our Johannesburg correspondent, 2 deserves attention.
('6', 217, 6, 9, 387322) It shows that the white population is altogether in the dark about our conditions.
('6', 217, 6, 10, 387405) Mr. Quinn believes that (1) the Asiatic Ordinance would have prevented the entry of Indians without permits; (2) there are many Indians who have entered the country without permits; (3) the Transvaal law would also have served to check Indian trade.
('6', 217, 6, 11, 387655) All these statements are incorrect.
('6', 217, 6, 12, 387691) The Transvaal Ordinance which has been disallowed would not have prevented the entry of permitless Indians.
('6', 217, 6, 13, 387799) The only law that can prevent the entry of such persons is the Peace Preservation Ordinance.
('6', 217, 6, 14, 387892) Also it is not true that many Indians enter without permits.
('6', 217, 6, 15, 387953) Recent cases show that people are effectively prevented from doing so.
('6', 217, 6, 16, 388024) Furthermore, every one knows that the Asiatic Ordinance had no bearing on Indian trade.
('6', 217, 6, 17, 388112) All the same, it should be borne in mind that harm is done to the whole Indian community to the extent that some try to enter without permits or with forged ones.
('6', 217, 6, 18, 388275) Those engaged in such activities should desist from them.
('6', 217, 6, 19, 388333) Above all, leading Indians should do all they can to remove this

('6', 218, 3, 6, 388846) It will be seen from our Johannesburg Letter that the Vrededorp Ordinance has been passed.
('6', 218, 3, 7, 388937) 1 Thus there is a danger of Vrededorp Indians having to leave the place.
('6', 218, 3, 8, 389010) Now that the Ordin ance has been passed, the Indian community should realize that there is much work ahead, and that it will have to put up a hard fight.
('6', 218, 3, 9, 389164) If the Asiatic Ordinance was cancelled, it was only because the matter was widely discussed in England.
('6', 218, 3, 10, 389268) The same telegram which brought us the news of the passing of the Vrededorp Ordinance also says that our Committee in London is working hard in the matter of the Natal Municipal Bill.
('6', 218, 3, 11, 389452) It remains to be seen what the result will be.
('6', 218, 3, 12, 389499) Whatever it be, one thing at least is proved by this: the Committee that we have formed in England should be strengthened and supported energeti cally.
('6', 218, 3, 13, 389651) It certainly ought not to be wound up.
('6', 218, 3, 14, 389690) We invite the attention of every reader to the summary of Mr. Ritchs first letter published by us.
('6', 218, 3, 15, 389789) If the Committee continues to work in that manner, there is every chance of our profiting a great deal.
('6', 218, 3, 16, 389893) This Ordinance [business] also shows that there is nothing like self help in any matter whatever.
('6', 218, 3, 17, 389991) That is, as long as we do not do what needs to be done in South Africa, we cannot hope for complete success.
('6', 218, 3, 18, 390100) What our duty is in South Africa, we shall consider on another occasion.

('6', 219, 2, 3, 390408) The quarrel between Japan and America still continues.
('6', 219, 2, 4, 390463) California has a large Japanese population, which has made much progress by dint of its intelligence and skill.
('6', 219, 2, 5, 390575) There are many Japanese boys in American schools.
('6', 219, 2, 6, 390625) The white population there cannot bear this.
('6', 219, 2, 7, 390670) Japan is putting up a hard fight over this issue.
('6', 219, 2, 8, 390720) So far, there has been no solution.
('6', 219, 2, 9, 390756) President Roosevelt is in a difficult situation.
('6', 219, 2, 10, 390805) On the one hand, a brave people like the Japanese is being insulted.
('6', 219, 2, 11, 390874) On the other, those among the white population who would not mind America being involved in a war refuse to listen to Roosevelts advice and do not allow Japanese boys to enter the schools.
('6', 219, 2, 12, 391063) It is an impossible situation.
('6', 219, 2, 13, 391094) America is not in a position even to fight.
('6', 219, 2, 14, 391138) The Japanese Navy is very much stronger than the American, and only recently it proved its mettle.
('6', 219, 2, 15, 391237) In a situation such as this, England too has to weigh matters carefully.
('6', 219, 2, 16, 391310) While the Japanese are friends of the English, the Ameri cans are their cousins.
('6', 219, 2, 17, 391391) Whom should England support?
('6', 219, 2, 18, 391420) It is believ ed that war can be averted only if England intervenes effectively.

('6', 219, 6, 22, 391569) QUINNS SPEECH
('6', 219, 7, 23, 391583) A feverish election campaign is going on in the Transvaal in view of the new parliament that is to come.
('6', 219, 7, 24, 391688) into existence.
('6', 219, 7, 25, 391704) Mr. Quinn is working hard to enter Parliament.
('6', 219, 7, 26, 391751) Addressing his electorate, he spoke to the following effect: As a result of the Asiatic Ordinance passed by the Legislative Council some time ago, it has become very diffi cult for Asiatics to enter without a permit.
('6', 219, 7, 27, 391968) Those who voted for that Act bore no malice towards the Asiatics.
('6', 219, 7, 28, 392034) There is no point in saying that they are British subjects.
('6', 219, 7, 29, 392094) For there are some British subjects with white skins with whom I would have nothing to do.
('6', 219, 8, 30, 392185) 1 These despatches were published regularly in Indian Opinion as from its Johannesburg correspondent.
('6', 220, 0, 1, 392287) VOL. 6: 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 221
('6', 220, 1, 2, 392330) It is in self defence therefore that we oppose their coming in.
('6', 220, 1, 3, 392394) Our views in this matter are identical with those expressed by Mr. Chamberlain, The Asiatics who manage to live on a tenth of the money needed by the whites are not justified in expecting to enter and settle here in large numbers It is not proper that such men should compete with us.
('6', 220, 1, 4, 392679) It is necessary therefore to take steps to prevent them from doing so.
('6', 220, 1, 5, 392750) The present position is that, out of the five thousand licences issued at Johannesburg, ten per cent.
('6', 220, 1, 6, 392852) have gone to the Asiatics270 to the Indians and 255 to the Chinese.
('6', 220, 1, 7, 392920) This should not happen.
('6', 220, 1, 8, 392944) These shops should be closed down and the shopkeepers given compen sation.
('6', 220, 1, 9, 393019) The British Government with held assent to the Asiatic Ordinance because they were not aware either of our real condition or of our feelings in the matter.
('6', 220, 1, 10, 393175) I do not believe that the British Govern ment intend to do us harm.
('6', 220, 1, 11, 393243) Theyhave not taken the side of the sufferers, and if they have with held assent to the Ordinance for that reason, they will not hesitate to accord sanction to the Ordinance when the [new] parliament of the Transvaal meets and reenacts it unanimously.

('6', 220, 5, 15, 393561) CHAPTER II: IDEAL MORALITY
('6', 220, 6, 16, 393588) The current views of morality are not of a very high order.
('6', 220, 6, 17, 393648) Some believe that morality is not something quite essential.
('6', 220, 6, 18, 393709) Others think that there is no relation between religion and morality.
('6', 220, 6, 19, 393779) But an examination of the worlds religions shows that, without morality, religion cannot subsist.
('6', 220, 6, 20, 393877) True morality covers religion for the most part.
('6', 220, 6, 21, 393926) Anyone who observes the laws of morality for their own sake and not for any selfish end can be regarded as religious.
('6', 220, 6, 22, 394044) There are men in Russia who dedicate their lives to the good of their country.
('6', 220, 6, 23, 394123) Such men are truly moral.
('6', 220, 6, 24, 394149) A man like Jeremy Bentham, who discovered many good principles for English legislation, tried very hard to spread education among the English and took a prominent part in improving the condition of prisoners, may be regarded as truly moral.
('6', 220, 6, 25, 394390) Besides, it is a rule of ideal morality that it is not enough to
('6', 221, 0, 1, 394455) 222 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 221, 1, 2, 394497) follow the trodden path.
('6', 221, 1, 3, 394522) We ought to follow the path which we know to be true, whether it is familiar or unfamiliar to us.
('6', 221, 1, 4, 394620) In other words, when we know a particular path to be the right one, we should set out on it without fear.
('6', 221, 1, 5, 394726) We can progress only if we observe the laws of morality in this way.
('6', 221, 1, 6, 394795) That is why true morality, true civilization and true progress are always to be found together.
('6', 221, 1, 7, 394891) If we examine our desires, we shall see that we do not wish for what we have already.
('6', 221, 1, 8, 394977) We always value more that which we do not have.
('6', 221, 1, 9, 395025) But desires are of two kinds: one is the pursuit of mere self interest.To attempt to fulfil this kind of desire is immoral.
('6', 221, 1, 10, 395149) The other impels us constantly to improve ourselves and to do good to others.
('6', 221, 1, 11, 395227) We should never become overweening with any amount of good that we may do.
('6', 221, 1, 12, 395302) It is not for us to evaluate it, but rather should we have perpetual longing to become better and do more good.
('6', 221, 1, 13, 395414) True morality consists in our effort to realize such longing.
('6', 221, 1, 14, 395476) If we have no home or family of our own, that is nothing to be ashamed of.
('6', 221, 1, 15, 395551) But if we have a home and abuse it, or own a business and practise fraud, we stray from the path of morality.
('6', 221, 1, 16, 395661) Morality consists in doing what we ought to do.
('6', 221, 1, 17, 395709) We can prove the need of morality through a few illustrations.
('6', 221, 1, 18, 395772) Destruction has been the lot of peoples or families in which the seeds of immorality, such as disunity and untruth, were found.
('6', 221, 1, 19, 395900) To take an example from trade and business, we do not come across a single person who will say that truth should not be followed.
('6', 221, 1, 20, 396030) The effect of justice and goodness is not felt from outside; these qualities in here in us.
('6', 221, 1, 21, 396122) Four hundred years ago, much injustice and untruth prevailed in Europe, so that people could not rest in peace even for a moment.
('6', 221, 1, 22, 396252) The cause of this state of affairs was that people had no morality.
('6', 221, 1, 23, 396320) If we take out the essence of all moral laws, we shall find that the attempt to do good to mankind is the highest morality.
('6', 221, 1, 24, 396444) If we open the treasure house of morality with this key, we shall find in it all the other principles.
('6', 221, 1, 25, 396547) At the end of each of these articles, we print select poems bearing on morality from Gujarati or Urdu poets in the hope that all our readers will benefit from them and will also commit them to memory.
('6', 221, 1, 26, 396748) We begin with an extract 1 from Mr. Malbaris 2 book, Adami Ane Teni Duniya.

('6', 222, 3, 4, 397087) CHHAGANLAL, I have your letter.
('6', 222, 3, 5, 397119) I dont get The Mercury at all these days.
('6', 222, 3, 6, 397161) Send me the back numbers, or cuttings.
('6', 222, 3, 7, 397200) As for the matter, I am sending five items today.
('6', 222, 3, 8, 397250) More tomorrow.
('6', 222, 3, 9, 397265) I have sent an article entitled White Races! Give a Gujarati translation of it, and also of Sir Charles Dilkes 2 speech.
('6', 222, 3, 10, 397386) You will find it in India.
('6', 222, 3, 11, 397413) I have written to Mr. West today asking him to give a photograph of the Amir 3 as supplement in the English section.
('6', 222, 3, 12, 397530) Please attend to that.
('6', 222, 3, 13, 397553) The thing must be done very soon.

('6', 222, 7, 20, 397810) CHHAGANLAL,
('6', 222, 8, 21, 397822) I sent some matter yesterday.
('6', 222, 8, 22, 397852) Today, I send something about the Hejaz Railway and an incomplete feature about the Amir.
('6', 222, 8, 23, 397942) The rest I shall write out tonight.
('6', 222, 8, 24, 397978) All this must appear this week.
('6', 222, 8, 25, 398010) I wrote to you earlier about the Amirs photograph.
('6', 222, 8, 26, 398061) Let me know how many extra copies sell.
('6', 222, 8, 27, 398101) What I write tonight will be in your hands on Thursday.

('6', 222, 8, 29, 398179) The list of persons in Johannesburg from whom subscriptions have been collected has been misplaced.

('6', 223, 1, 3, 398703) He may entrust the work to Mania 1, if he chooses.
('6', 223, 1, 4, 398754) I will also write.
('6', 223, 1, 5, 398773) One should sometimes use ones discretion in matters like these.
('6', 223, 1, 6, 398837) Your devoting an hour between 8 and 9 to Manilal will naturally provoke resentment.
('6', 223, 1, 7, 398921) It looks improper that you should do private work for me during Press hours.
('6', 223, 1, 8, 398998) It should be enough, therefore, if you can give him any time before 8 in the morning or some time in the evening.
('6', 223, 1, 9, 399112) It should be left to his luck what he can learn in that time.
('6', 223, 1, 10, 399174) I have promised a piano to Mania and that is what stands in the way.
('6', 223, 1, 11, 399243) If he is agreeable, by all means save the expense for the present.
('6', 223, 1, 12, 399310) It was good that an appeal for a band was made.
('6', 223, 1, 13, 399358) I feel this begging is selfless.
('6', 223, 1, 14, 399391) If a band is secured, everyone will share in the benefit.
('6', 223, 1, 15, 399449) I see its need for [every] one of us.
('6', 223, 1, 16, 399487) I dont think Mr. West has made any mistake in this matter.
('6', 223, 1, 17, 399546) It is not necessary to spend much effort on the thing.
('6', 223, 1, 18, 399601) The loss of one day doesnt matter.
('6', 223, 1, 19, 399636) We want ultimately to save time.
('6', 223, 1, 20, 399669) The men we have are not yet well trained; when they are, all work will proceed apace.
('6', 223, 1, 21, 399755) I will give my views about the Hindi [section] after I hear from you again.
('6', 223, 1, 22, 399831) It is certain, however, that the venture will be possible only if we are assured of subscribers in advance.
('6', 223, 1, 23, 399939) There is no objection to giving the market rates in the English section.
('6', 223, 1, 24, 400012) They would go better, however, in the Gujarati sectionor in the advertisement columns.
('6', 223, 1, 25, 400099) The English section is purely political at present; therefore, market rates will appear out of place in it.
('6', 223, 1, 26, 400207) I will write about the bill for the Anti Indian Law Fund after giving some thought to it.
('6', 223, 1, 27, 400297) Ismail Mia has agreed to have the advertisement without a block.
('6', 223, 1, 28, 400362) You may therefore have it so.
('6', 223, 1, 29, 400392) Perhaps he will pay only for the reduced space.
('6', 223, 1, 30, 400440) Give me full particulars about the cuttings that have been left over.
('6', 223, 1, 31, 400510) I have written to Beck to say hat I cannot recommend patent medicines to anyone, since most of them seem to have no stuff in them.

('6', 224, 6, 8, 400956) CHHAGANLAL, I have gone through the latest issue of India.
('6', 224, 6, 9, 401015) Apart from giving any abstracts from it, if there is anything special worth translating, a translation should be given as a separate article.
('6', 224, 6, 10, 401157) There is no letter from you today.
('6', 224, 6, 11, 401192) I received the telegram.
('6', 224, 6, 12, 401217) The Shah [of Iran] is not much thought of here.
('6', 224, 6, 13, 401265) However, there is no harm in giving a photograph, if a good one is available.
('6', 224, 6, 14, 401343) The Amir is a Sunni and the Muslim community here is also of the same sect, and so they are interested in reading more about him.
('6', 224, 6, 15, 401473) The Shah is a Shia.

('6', 224, 10, 21, 401806) His Majesty the Amir of Afghanistan has shown his nobility within a few days of his arrival in India.
('6', 224, 10, 22, 401908) This is shown by two Reuter messages received here.
('6', 224, 10, 23, 401960) When he was inspecting a guard of honour in Delhi, he was offered an umbrella because it was raining.
('6', 224, 10, 24, 402062) The Amir too preferred to get drenched and refused the umbrella because the

('6', 225, 1, 2, 402512) soldiers were all exposed to the rain.
('6', 225, 1, 3, 402551) The second cable says that the Muslims who wished to give a party in the Amirs honour had arranged for a hundred cows to be slaughtered on the occasion.
('6', 225, 1, 4, 402704) The Amir suggested that this would probably offend the Hindu sentiment and advised the gentlemen that they might slaughter goats instead.
('6', 225, 1, 5, 402842) They accepted his advice.
('6', 225, 1, 6, 402868) It is said that the whole of India was agreeably surprised by the Amirs gesture.
('6', 225, 1, 7, 402949) All the more so, as they did not expect His Majesty to show concern for others to the extent that he did.These two incidents show that His Majesty the Amir has a considerate and sincere mind.
('6', 225, 1, 8, 403141) On both the occasions he thought of the people[s wishes], thus setting an example for monarchs of the West to learn from.
('6', 225, 1, 9, 403263) Though the news agencies cannot tell us of more instances of such thoughtful actions of his, one can easily imagine that Amir Habibullah has all the virtues that his name 1 connotes.

('6', 225, 5, 13, 403521) In Ladysmith, Tongaat and other places, applications by [Indian] traders for licences have been rejected by the licensing officers and licences refused.
('6', 225, 5, 14, 403674) At some places they have pointed to lack of cleanliness, or to the account books not being in order, while at others no reasons whatever have been given.
('6', 225, 5, 15, 403828) Hence the traders have become anxious and wonder what will happen if they do not get their licences.

('6', 225, 9, 22, 404270) We believe that, as there are in the world few men of any class who can compete with the

('6', 226, 1, 2, 404476) Indians considered from all points of view, so are there few women anywhere in the world who can compare with Indian women.
('6', 226, 1, 3, 404600) But this position can no longer be kept up in the present squalid, low and helpless state of India.
('6', 226, 1, 4, 404700) The modern age is such that it does not allow anyone to remain in the same position.
('6', 226, 1, 5, 404785) Those who do not want to go forward, or do not do so, must fall behind.
('6', 226, 1, 6, 404857) In so far as this is true, we can see that Indian men have deliberately kept their women backward.
('6', 226, 1, 7, 404956) Those who pose as refor mers as also other well to do Indians, whether Hindu or Muslim, Parsi or Christian, either treat their women as if they were playthings or use them as they fancy for self indulgence, with the result that they themselves become weak and help only to produce weaklings.
('6', 226, 1, 8, 405248) And in this way they lead irreligious lives and still say, It is Gods will that prevails. If this state of affairs continues, India will remain in its present abominable condition even if she were to secure all her rights from the British Government.
('6', 226, 1, 9, 405499) In all countries where the people live a decent life, there is no disparity in the condition 1 of men and women.
('6', 226, 1, 10, 405612) It is easy to see how much the real wealth of India would be attenuated, if one half of her human beings remained ignorant and existed only as playthings of the others.
('6', 226, 1, 11, 405781) These thoughts occurred to us while reading an address delivered to French girls by M. Lavis, a great servant of France.
('6', 226, 1, 12, 405902) Only a few years ago French women were in the same plight in which Indian women are today.
('6', 226, 1, 13, 405993) French society has now awakened and does not wish to let a half of its body remain inactive.
('6', 226, 1, 14, 406086) We give below a short summary of M. Laviss speech: Girls, there is much for you to learn.
('6', 226, 1, 15, 406176) It is your function to use the needle and the scissors.
('6', 226, 1, 16, 406232) You have to learn how to keep your home tidy.
('6', 226, 1, 17, 406278) If there is order in the home, its influence will be felt without, and the village or town will reflect the state of the home.
('6', 226, 1, 18, 406405) You will also have to learn to use money.
('6', 226, 1, 19, 406447) You will be mothers one day, and your childrens future will depend on you.
('6', 226, 1, 20, 406522) It is not enough that you learn to read and write.
('6', 226, 1, 21, 406573) You have to cultivate your minds too.
('6', 226, 1, 22, 406611) For it is the mother who provides the real training for her child.
('6', 226, 1, 23, 406678) Just as you ought to develop your minds, so do, whether they are better or worse off than you.
('6', 226, 1, 24, 406773) That is why must you inform yourself of what is happening around you, what countries there are in the world besides your own, what people there you are taught history and geography.

('6', 227, 1, 2, 407045) Just as there are schools for boys, there ought to be schools for girls also.
('6', 227, 1, 3, 407123) It is while thus addressing schoolgirls genially at a large Paris school that M. Lavis indicated in passing the duty of parents.
('6', 227, 1, 4, 407252) We have a large number of girls and women among Indians in South Africa.
('6', 227, 1, 5, 407325) It is our definite opinion that they should both have good education.
('6', 227, 1, 6, 407395) Such education can be easily imparted; but only if we stop dallying with our womenfolk and realize our duty.
('6', 227, 1, 7, 407504) While imparting education, we have to bear in mind its aims.
('6', 227, 1, 8, 407565) We would gain nothing if such education were designed for selfish ends.
('6', 227, 1, 9, 407637) That would be only like changing ones dress.

('6', 227, 5, 21, 408254) At present there subsists amity between Japan and Britain.

('6', 227, 9, 26, 408485) CHAPTER III: WHAT IS MORAL ACTION?
('6', 227, 10, 27, 408520) When can it be said that a particular action is moral?
('6', 227, 10, 28, 408575) In asking this question, the intention is not to contrast moral with immoral actions, but to consider many of our everyday actions against which nothing can be said from the conventional standpoint and which some
('6', 227, 11, 29, 408788) 1 Vide Japan and America, 12 1 1907.
('6', 228, 0, 1, 408825) VOL. 6: 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 229
('6', 228, 1, 2, 408868) regard as moral.
('6', 228, 1, 3, 408885) Most of our actions are probably non moral; they do not necessarily involve morality.
('6', 228, 1, 4, 408971) For the most part we act according to the prevailing conventions.
('6', 228, 1, 5, 409037) Such conventional behavi our is often necessary.
('6', 228, 1, 6, 409086) If no such rules are observed, anarchy would be the result, and societysocial intercoursewould come to an end.
('6', 228, 1, 7, 409197) Still the mere observance of custom and usage cannot properly be called morality.
('6', 228, 1, 8, 409279) A moral act must be our own act: it must spring from our own will.
('6', 228, 1, 9, 409346) If we act mechanically, there is no moral content in our act.
('6', 228, 1, 10, 409408) Such action would be moral, if we think it proper to act like a machine and do so.
('6', 228, 1, 11, 409491) For in doing so, we use our discrimination.
('6', 228, 1, 12, 409535) We should bear in mind the distinction between acting mechanically and acting inten tionally.
('6', 228, 1, 13, 409629) It may be moral of a king to pardon a culprit.
('6', 228, 1, 14, 409676) But the messenger bearing the order of pardon plays only a mechanical part in the kings moral act.
('6', 228, 1, 15, 409775) But if the messenger were to bear the kings order, considering it to be his duty, his action would be a moral one.
('6', 228, 1, 16, 409890) How can a man understand morality who does not use his own intelligence and power of thought, but lets himself be swept along like a log of wood by a current?
('6', 228, 1, 17, 410049) Sometimes a man defies convention and acts on his own with a view to [doing] absolute good.
('6', 228, 1, 18, 410141) Such a great hero was Wendell Phillips 1. Addressing an assembly of people, he once said, Till you learn to form your own opinions and express them, I do not care much what you think of me. Thus when we all care only for what our conscience says, then alone can we be regarded to have stepped on to the moral road.
('6', 228, 1, 19, 410456) We shall not reach this stage, as long as we do not believeand experience the beliefthat God within us, the God of all, is the ever present witness to all our acts.
('6', 228, 1, 20, 410621) It is not enough that an act done by us is in itself good; it should have been done with the intention to do good.
('6', 228, 1, 21, 410736) That is to say, whether an act is moral or otherwise depends upon the intention of the doer.
('6', 228, 1, 22, 410829) Two men may have done exactly the same thing; but the act of one may be moral, and that of the other the contrary.
('6', 228, 1, 23, 410944) Take, for instance, a man who out of great pity feeds the poor and another who does the same, but with the motive of winning prestige or with some such selfish end.
('6', 228, 1, 24, 411109) Though the action is the same, the act of the one is moral and that of the other non moral.
('6', 228, 1, 25, 411201) The reader here ought to remember the distinction between the two words, non moral and immoral.
('6', 228, 1, 26, 411297) It may be that we do not always see good results flowing from a moral act.
('6', 228, 1, 27, 411372) While thinking of morality, all that we need to see is that the act is

('6', 229, 0, 1, 411506) 230 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 229, 1, 2, 411548) good and is done with a good intention.
('6', 229, 1, 3, 411588) The result of an action is not within our control.
('6', 229, 1, 4, 411639) God alone is the giver of fruit.
('6', 229, 1, 5, 411672) Historians have called Emperor Alexander great.
('6', 229, 1, 6, 411720) Wherever he went [in the course of his conquests,] he took the Greek language and Greek culture, arts and manners, and today we enjoy the benefits of Greek civilization.
('6', 229, 1, 7, 411890) But the intention of Alexander behind all this was only conquest and renown.
('6', 229, 1, 8, 411967) Who can therefore say that his actions were moral?
('6', 229, 1, 9, 412018) It was all right that he was termed great, but moral he cannot be called.
('6', 229, 1, 10, 412092) These reflections prove that it is not enough for a moral act to have been done with a good intention, but it should have been done without compulsion.
('6', 229, 1, 11, 412244) There is no morality whatever in my act, if I rise early out of the fear that, if I am late for my office, I may lose my situation.
('6', 229, 1, 12, 412376) Similarly there is no morality in my living a simple and unpretentious life if I have not the means to live otherwise.
('6', 229, 1, 13, 412495) But plain, simple living would be moral if, though wealthy, I think of all the want and misery in the world about meand feel that Iought to live a plain, simple life and not one of ease and luxury.
('6', 229, 1, 14, 412693) Like wise it is only selfish, and not moral, of an employer to sympathize with his employees or to pay them higher wages lest they leave him.
('6', 229, 1, 15, 412835) It would be moral if the employer wished well of them and treated them kindly realizing how he owed his prosperity to them.
('6', 229, 1, 16, 412959) This means that for an act to be moral it has to be free from fear and compulsion.
('6', 229, 1, 17, 413042) When the peasants rose in revolt and with bloodshot eyes went to King Richard II of England demanding their rights, he granted them the rights under his own seal and signature.
('6', 229, 1, 18, 413219) But when the danger was over, he forced them to surrender the letters.
('6', 229, 1, 19, 413290) It would be a mistake for anyone to say that King Richards first act was moral and the second immoral.
('6', 229, 1, 20, 413393) For his first act was done only out of fear and had not an iota of morality about it.
('6', 229, 1, 21, 413479) Just as a moral action should be free from fear or compulsion so should there be no self interest behind it.
('6', 229, 1, 22, 413588) This is not to say that actions prompted by self interest are all worthless, but only that to call them moral would detract from the [dignity of the] moral idea.
('6', 229, 1, 23, 413750) That honesty cannot long endure which is practised in the belief that it is the best policy.
('6', 229, 1, 24, 413843) As Shakespeare says, love born out of the profit motive is no love.

('6', 230, 1, 2, 414047) Just as an action prompted by the motive of material gain here on earth is non moral, so also another done for considerations of comfort and personal happiness in another world is non moral.
('6', 230, 1, 3, 414238) That action is moral which is done only for the sake of doing good.
('6', 230, 1, 4, 414306) A great Christian, St. Francis Xavier, passionately prayed that his mind might always remain pure.
('6', 230, 1, 5, 414405) 1 For him devotion to God was not for enjoying a higher seat after death.
('6', 230, 1, 6, 414479) He prayed because it was mans duty to pray.
('6', 230, 1, 7, 414523) The great Saint Theresa wished to have a torch in her right hand and a vessel of water in her left, so that with the one she might burn the glories of heaven and with the other extinguish the fires of hell, and men might learn to serve God from love alone without fear of hell and without temptation of heavenly bliss.
('6', 230, 1, 8, 414842) To preserve morality thus demands a brave man prepared to face even death.
('6', 230, 1, 9, 414917) It is cowardice to be true to friends and to break faith with enemies.
('6', 230, 1, 10, 414988) Those who do good out of fear and haltingly have no moral virtue.
('6', 230, 1, 11, 415054) Henry Clay, known for his kind liness, sacrificed his convic tions to his ambition.
('6', 230, 1, 12, 415138) Daniel Webster 2, for all his great intellect and his sense of the heroic and the sublime, once sold his intellectualintegrity for a price.
('6', 230, 1, 13, 415278) By a single mean act he wiped out all his good deeds.
('6', 230, 1, 14, 415332) This shows how difficult it is to judge the morality of a mans action because we cannot penetrate the depths of his mind.
('6', 230, 1, 15, 415454) We have also the answer to the question raised at the outset in this chapter: what is a moral action?

('6', 231, 4, 9, 416873) Some say that every Indian trader should be paid compensation and sent back.

('6', 231, 7, 26, 418117) The Registrar refuses to help and demands to know why a permit should be sought after the Supreme Court has ruled that no permit is necessary for children.
('6', 231, 7, 27, 418273) It appears the

('6', 232, 1, 2, 418331) Registrar is only venting his anger.
('6', 232, 1, 3, 418368) It is true that minor children need no permit.
('6', 232, 1, 4, 418415) But that does not mean that a permit should not be issued to them as a safeguard when they become majors or go out of the Transvaal.
('6', 232, 1, 5, 418548) Now there seems to be no remedy other than a petition.
('6', 232, 1, 6, 418603) For the law does not oblige the Permit Office to issue such permits.
('6', 232, 1, 7, 418672) The law only says that children need no permits and that they will be protected against harassment from any quarter.

('6', 232, 5, 11, 418861) While commenting on the report of the Superintendent of Education in Natal.
('6', 232, 5, 12, 418937) 1 we said that we would consider later how educated Indians could help without much trouble to themselves.
('6', 232, 5, 13, 419044) We do so now.
('6', 232, 5, 14, 419058) Among Indians, grown ups as well as children have much to learn.
('6', 232, 5, 15, 419123) During the day, most of them are too busy to learn anything.
('6', 232, 5, 16, 419184) Similarly, educated Indians also are busy at that time.
('6', 232, 5, 17, 419240) In all big cities of the world, there are large numbers of night schools.
('6', 232, 5, 18, 419314) We take it that there are some truly educated young Indians who are patriotic and anxious to pass on to others the education that they have themselves had.
('6', 232, 5, 19, 419470) Such persons can persuade all grown ups and boys, with whom they come in contact, to learn; and if three or four persons agree to do so, they can decide to gather at one place.
('6', 232, 5, 20, 419647) Even if only one person is willing, it should still be possible for them to go to his place to teach him.
('6', 232, 5, 21, 419753) As things stand, those who wish to learn are as few as those prepared to teach.
('6', 232, 5, 22, 419833) For anyone who is eager to teach, it is not therefore enough just to be ready to do so.
('6', 232, 5, 23, 419921) It is also necessary to inspire others with the urge to learn.Some may, we are well aware, think that all this sounds nice on paper, but that it is not so easy to work out.
('6', 232, 5, 24, 420094) We only wish to say in reply that what we write here is addressed to courageous patriots and that it is moreover based on experience and so ought not to be dismissed as impracti cable.

('6', 233, 2, 3, 420451) Wednesday, [On or before January 23, 1907] 1
('6', 233, 3, 4, 420496) CHHAGANLAL, I have not yet answered the points you raised in your letter of the 9th.
('6', 233, 3, 5, 420581) I did not follow what Mr. Anglia 2 and Mr. Osman said about advertisements.
('6', 233, 3, 6, 420657) I want a list in English, with prices, of Hindi and Tamil books available with Mr. Abdool Haq or Doraisamy.
('6', 233, 3, 7, 420765) A White wants such books for Indians who work with him, that is, he wants books which Indians of average ability and knowing some Hindi or Tamil can understand.
('6', 233, 3, 8, 420926) I have promised him a list.
('6', 233, 3, 9, 420954) Let me know what happened about the demand for a Hindi section.
('6', 233, 3, 10, 421018) I have not yet selected a photograph for the block.
('6', 233, 3, 11, 421070) I have great faith in you.
('6', 233, 3, 12, 421097) I am in no position to give thought to myself.
('6', 233, 3, 13, 421144) There is much work to be done.
('6', 233, 3, 14, 421175) We are only a few, and not all of us well up in general knowledge.
('6', 233, 3, 15, 421242) As I think of all this, I feel inclined to send you immediately to England.
('6', 233, 3, 16, 421318) I want to know, however, if you have fully grasped the Indian problem here.
('6', 233, 3, 17, 421394) What do you feel yourself?
('6', 233, 3, 18, 421421) What encouragement is Maganlal likely to give?
('6', 233, 3, 19, 421468) What does Anandlal think?
('6', 233, 3, 20, 421494) All the same I want your opinion immediately whether Thakkar can assume the responsibility for the Gujarati section.
('6', 233, 3, 21, 421611) I should like you to sail off, no harm even if it takes four monthsprovided of course Maganlal agrees to share the financial burden and Miss West picks up the accounts.
('6', 233, 3, 22, 421780) I leaveit to you whether or not to talk to others.
('6', 233, 3, 23, 421831) You may talk about it only if you think fit.
('6', 233, 3, 24, 421876) If you yourself feel that you should not go yet, there is no need to pursue the matter further.
('6', 233, 3, 25, 421972) In any case from next week pass on the responsibility for translations, etc., in the Gujarati section to Thakkar, so that you may be free for other work.
('6', 233, 3, 26, 422126) It will suffice if you supervise the general policy of Indian Opinion.
('6', 233, 3, 27, 422197) I dont think the last issue was bad.
('6', 233, 3, 28, 422234) I will let you know after I hear from you as to what was held over.

('6', 234, 1, 5, 422764) He has a chance of getting a job in Durban.
('6', 234, 1, 6, 422808) Relieve him, therefore, on Monday, and pay him the arrears of his salary.
('6', 234, 1, 7, 422882) Write to me if you think that a substitute will be necessary.
('6', 234, 1, 8, 422944) I shall wait for more information about Tongaat.
('6', 234, 1, 9, 422993) There was a telegram here also.
('6', 234, 1, 10, 423025) You will be surprised to know that Mr. Isaac had been to Pretoria.
('6', 234, 1, 11, 423092) I will take him round here too, and send him to Pretoria once again.
('6', 234, 1, 12, 423161) Kalyandas told me that he had not received the complete list relating to Pretoria.
('6', 234, 1, 13, 423244) Send me one again.

('6', 234, 1, 15, 423371) I have not looked into them.
('6', 234, 1, 16, 423400) If there is anything in these figures to which it is worth drawing my attention, please let me know.
('6', 234, 1, 17, 423501) What you say about advertisements concerning fish is right.
('6', 234, 1, 18, 423561) We will not refuse such advertisements if we receive any, but we will not solicit them.
('6', 234, 1, 19, 423649) So long as the name has not been changed in the Colonial Office, we must take out the licence in the name of Madanjit 1. Please do so.
('6', 234, 1, 20, 423784) I had received the cutting concerning Jivanji.
('6', 234, 1, 21, 423831) But what was to be done about it?
('6', 234, 1, 22, 423865) You gave a summary of it in Gujarati.
('6', 234, 1, 23, 423903) Have you received Jivanjis money from Mombasa?
('6', 234, 1, 24, 423950) If not collect it from Adamji.
('6', 234, 1, 25, 423981) It will be well to go to the Cape during Easter.
('6', 234, 1, 26, 424030) I will write to Abdool Gani.
('6', 234, 1, 27, 424059) It is impossible for us to bring out the Tamil [section] just now.
('6', 234, 1, 28, 424126) Its time will come by and by.
('6', 234, 1, 29, 424156) I see no need to write to Mr. Aiyar.
('6', 234, 1, 30, 424193) Your replying in the negative is sufficient.

('6', 235, 5, 13, 425000) The Natal Advertiser has published what purports to be a report of an Indian meeting held in order to consider certain complaints against the Natal Indian Congress and to form a new body.
('6', 235, 5, 14, 425188) We notice, from our Johannesburg correspondence, that the contents of the precious report were telegraphed to the Johannesburg Star, in extenso.
('6', 235, 5, 15, 425333) It evidently appears as if the wish was father to the thought, and that some good natured people would rather see a quarrel between different sections of the Indian community.
('6', 235, 5, 16, 425509) We may, therefore, assure these friends that such a quarrel is not possible, because there can be no backbone to it.
('6', 235, 5, 17, 425626) It is worthy of note that it is not stated in the inspired report where the meeting took place, who convened it, who attended it, and when it was held.
('6', 235, 5, 18, 425778) We have, however, taken the trouble to inquire about it, and we find that some such meeting did take place at a private house.
('6', 235, 5, 19, 425905) But the whole aspect is changed when the facts are known.
('6', 235, 5, 20, 425963) The meeting discussed the question of founding a political institution apart from the Congress, but little encouragement was given by the speakers to this proposal, and the weight of opinion did not favour it.
('6', 235, 5, 21, 426173) We think the following letter, addressed to The Advertiser by Mr. V. Lawrence, Chairman of the meeting, places the matter in its true light:
('6', 235, 6, 22, 426314) Sir, In your second edition of the 17th instant, there appears on page 5 what purports to be the report of a meeting of the Colonial Hindus and Christianized Indians that took place on Tuesday night last, headed Natal Hindus, Dissatisfaction with the Natal Indian Congress, Representation Desired.
('6', 235, 6, 23, 426612) As chairman of that meeting, I must most emphatically refute many of the statements therein.
('6', 235, 6, 24, 426705) The object of that meeting was to form a very influential and representative committee to approach the Natal Indian
('6', 236, 0, 1, 426821) VOL. 6: 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 237
('6', 236, 1, 2, 426864) Congress, which is recognized by the Imperial and Colonial Governments as the representative institution of the Indian community in Natal, to make it a more representative body than it is at present.
('6', 236, 1, 3, 427064) It is not true that it was pointed out during the discussion that the association of the Colonial Indian and Hindu community with the Mohammadan merchants was derogatory to the good opinion of the European section of the country in regard to the former.It was not only the idea, but the first and foremost object of the meeting was, and all the discussion that night was directed to achieve that object, to unite with, and not to dissociate from, the Natal Indian Congress, to obtain redress for the disabilities that are and may be heaped upon the Indian community.
('6', 236, 2, 4, 427631) It is not correct that minor matters were then discussed and the meeting broke up without any definite decision being come to.
('6', 236, 2, 5, 427758) The meeting dispersed after the election of a thoroughly representative committee of all classes of the Indian community to approach the Natal Indian Congress, and I was deputed to interview the President and the Secretaries of the Congress, and ascertain from them what day, time and place will suit the Congress to hear the views of the committee.
('6', 236, 2, 6, 428108) We have neither desire nor intention to work against either the Congress or the Europeans, but to unite with the Congress in creating a better understanding between the European and Indian communities.
('6', 236, 2, 7, 428310) We are glad to notice that the prominent Hindus of Durban met together on Sunday for the purpose of repudiating the statements made in the newspaper report.
('6', 236, 2, 8, 428467) Mr. Sanghavi, the Chairman of this meeting, said that perfect amity and concord existed between the different sections of the Indian community, irrespective of caste, creed or religion.
('6', 236, 2, 9, 428653) If, however, there are any young Indians, besides the person that concocted The Advertiser report, who feel aggrieved at not being able to figure prominently in the work of the Congress, we strongly advise them to steer clear of any movement that would bring about discord between the different sections of the community.
('6', 236, 2, 10, 428975) It may be well to examine the origin of the Natal Indian Congress 1. It was established when a general attack on the Indian community on the part of some European colonists was commenced.
('6', 236, 2, 11, 429163) The trustees of the Congress include two Hindus, one of them a Tamil gentleman, and on the Congress membership are scores of Hindus and Christians belonging to different presidencies of India.
('6', 236, 2, 12, 429356) Its objects are

('6', 237, 1, 2, 429636) all embracing, and if the attention paid to the Tamil community is to count for anything, it is but simple truth to state that, during the first few years of the Congress existence, it was largely occupied with matters more especially concerning that community.
('6', 237, 1, 3, 429898) It may also be not amiss to say, in passing, that it was under the aegis of the Congress that the Natal Indian Educational Association was able to thrive and flourish.
('6', 237, 1, 4, 430066) The Congress Hall was placed free of charge at its disposal.
('6', 237, 1, 5, 430127) The Congress funds, again, enabled the Diamond Jubilee Library 1, opened chiefly in the interests of Colonial Indians, to be established.
('6', 237, 1, 6, 430265) If the Indian traders today loom large at the Congress meetings, it is because they are the most in danger; and if they were neglected or allowed themselves to be neglected, who will suffer?
('6', 237, 1, 7, 430456) Certainly the whole Indian community; for throughout the world it is the commer cial class that supplies the sinews of war and even common sense to the community or nation to which it belongs.

('6', 237, 2, 9, 430675) 229. WILL THERE BE DISSENSION AMONG INDIANS?
('6', 237, 3, 10, 430720) The Advertiser has published a report under the heading The Hindus of Natal which will perhaps cause concern among some Indians.
('6', 237, 3, 11, 430849) However, we do not think, there is any need to be agitated.
('6', 237, 3, 12, 430909) We print a summary of that report elsewhere.
('6', 237, 3, 13, 430954) The report does not say who attended the meeting or where it was held.
('6', 237, 3, 14, 431025) Also, we do not find what resolution was passed at the meeting.
('6', 237, 3, 15, 431089) There is no doubt that this is the work of some disgruntled Indians.
('6', 237, 3, 16, 431158) It is obvious enough that they will receive help from the Europeans.
('6', 237, 3, 17, 431227) We have with us a circular notice of that meeting, signed by Messrs Bryan Gabriel, V. Lawrence and A. D. Pillay; and the meeting was held at Mr. A. D. Pillays house on the 15th at eight oclock.
('6', 237, 3, 18, 431421) No action by us is called for, since there is no reason why any changes should be made in the constitution of the Congress.
('6', 237, 3, 19, 431545) Moreover, this meeting was merely meant to be a threat, and there can be no question of yielding to such threats and making changes.
('6', 237, 3, 20, 431678) However, it is the duty of the Congress leaders to adhere to the Congress constitution and to all its rules.
('6', 237, 3, 21, 431787) Congress members who have not paid their subscription should be made to do so, and annual reports published as before.
('6', 237, 3, 22, 431906) As for the meeting, it is not necessary to blame either those who convened or those who attended it.
('6', 237, 3, 23, 432007) It can be

('6', 238, 1, 3, 432311) The only thing for thoughtful people and the Congress to do is their duty, and then they should not entertain any fear.
('6', 238, 1, 4, 432431) If this is done, there will be no dissension.

('6', 238, 4, 7, 432544) At the beginning of each year Indians in Natal go through a period of acute anxiety.
('6', 238, 4, 8, 432629) All traders, big and small remain in suspense for they are not sure whether they will get [renewed] licences.
('6', 238, 4, 9, 432739) This time, it seems, preparations are afoot for greater harassment [of Indians].
('6', 238, 4, 10, 432820) LADYSMITH In Ladysmith notice has been given to all traders that they will not get their licences next year.
('6', 238, 4, 11, 432929) Some have been refused lice nces even for the current year for the alleged reason that they do not know how to keep accounts in English.
('6', 238, 5, 12, 433066) TONGAAT
('6', 238, 6, 13, 433074) In Tongaat licences have been refused to many Indians, the reasons given being lack of cleanliness and the unsatisfactory condition of accounts.
('6', 238, 7, 14, 433219) ELSEWHERE
('6', 238, 8, 15, 433229) Meetings are held all over the Colony where Europeans pass resolutions to the effect that no licences should be issued to Indian traders.
('6', 238, 8, 16, 433367) There is no immediate danger, as a result of these resolutions, of licences being withheld in all places.
('6', 238, 8, 17, 433473) There is no doubt, however, that, if steps are not taken from now on, it will be too late afterwards.
('6', 238, 9, 18, 433575) REMEDIAL MEASURES Let us consider what measures can be taken.
('6', 238, 9, 19, 433637) It is quite necessary that those who have been refused licences should file appeals with the Licensing Board.
('6', 238, 9, 20, 433747) Such appeals cost very little.
('6', 238, 9, 21, 433778) While preferring an

('6', 239, 1, 2, 433867) appeal, it is necessary to produce evidence regarding account books, the condition of shops, etc.
('6', 239, 1, 3, 433965) The reason for filing an appeal is that it is the only legal remedy.
('6', 239, 1, 4, 434034) It must be resorted to before other steps are taken.
('6', 239, 1, 5, 434087) Moreover, by filing the appeals, it will be possible to prove that the licensing officer and the Licensing Board are a single [authority], not two different ones.
('6', 239, 1, 6, 434250) Along with the appeal an application should also be made to the local Government, that is, to the Colonial Secretary.
('6', 239, 2, 7, 434368) THE CONGRESS
('6', 239, 3, 8, 434381) In this matter, it is necessary to know the help that can be expected from the Congress and the expenditure that should be borne by each individual.
('6', 239, 3, 9, 434530) The Congress will be able to write to the Govern ment.
('6', 239, 3, 10, 434585) But where it is necessary to file appeals, the residents of the respective towns and places will have to bear the cost.
('6', 239, 4, 11, 434705) SOUTH AFRICA BRITISH INDIAN COMMITTEE
('6', 239, 5, 12, 434743) As far as we know the Congress has sent a cable to the South Africa British Indian Committee asking it to take the necessary measures in the matter of licences.
('6', 239, 5, 13, 434904) It will be the duty of the Congress to send additional information to the Committee as soon as the results of the appeals are known.
('6', 239, 5, 14, 435037) The Committee will probably be able to work better if it is posted with full information.
('6', 239, 5, 15, 435127) We should also add that, if most people followed the same procedure or acted through the same lawyer, the results would be better.
('6', 239, 5, 16, 435258) Whether or not this is possible, it is essential that people should inform the Secretaries of the Congress immediately.
('6', 239, 5, 17, 435378) But even if the people do not send the information, the Congress should not stand still.
('6', 239, 5, 18, 435467) The Secretaries orother persons on behalf of the Congress should go from place to place collecting information.
('6', 239, 5, 19, 435579) We should remember that the Europeans work united throughout the Colony and we should act in the same fashion.
('6', 239, 6, 20, 435690) FEAR In this struggle we should have no fear.
('6', 239, 6, 21, 435736) The Indian who concerns himself only with his own licence unmindful of what happens to others will be thought unmanly and a coward.
('6', 239, 6, 22, 435868) It will be a great mistake for anyone to obtain a licence by flattery.
('6', 239, 6, 23, 435939) It must be clearly understood that, if harm is caused by putting one trader against another, the jealous whites will not fail to exploit the situation.
('6', 239, 6, 24, 436091) Such steps are outside the scope [of our objectives] and in the nature
('6', 240, 0, 1, 436162) VOL. 6: 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 241
('6', 240, 1, 2, 436205) of underhand dealings.
('6', 240, 2, 3, 436228) MEASURES CONCERNING OURSELVES Let us now consider measures in so far as they concern us.
('6', 240, 2, 4, 436317) In this fight we must know for certain whether or not we are at fault.
('6', 240, 2, 5, 436388) He who cannot see his own fault is doomed.
('6', 240, 2, 6, 436431) [On the other hand,] that we may suffer even when there is nothing that can be said against us is contrary to experience.
('6', 240, 2, 7, 436553) It is our duty to offer resistance by legitimate, constitutional means; it is also our duty to think of our own faults.
('6', 240, 2, 8, 436673) In relation to the law, we are at fault on three points: (1) lack of cleanliness; (2) the bad state of account books; and (3) the location of residence and shop in the same premises.
('6', 240, 3, 9, 436856) LACK OF CLEANLINESS In regard to lack of cleanliness, we must confess that, though we are not as bad as Europeans make us out to be, the charge is by and large justified.
('6', 240, 3, 10, 437027) The phrase lack of cleanliness covers both the general appearance of the house and ones personal appearance.
('6', 240, 4, 11, 437136) CONDITION OF SHOP Very often the shop is found to be in a slovenly condition.
('6', 240, 4, 12, 437214) The backyard is full of slush and dirt.
('6', 240, 4, 13, 437254) Even the interior of the shop is sometimes dirty, and we are content that our shops should look like hovels.
('6', 240, 4, 14, 437363) All this must change.
('6', 240, 4, 15, 437385) It will be wise to give up all hope of carrying on trade anyhow, as we do in India, without giving much thought to the condition of the shop.
('6', 240, 4, 16, 437527) If we cannot maintain our shop in as good a condition as the Europeans of better standing do, we do not deserve to be in trade.
('6', 240, 4, 17, 437655) When they see our huts adjoining their well kept shops, and see the same things being sold in our huts as in theirs, they are bound to feel a grudge against us.
('6', 240, 4, 18, 437816) Let us not answer by asking if some Europeans do not also keep their shops untidy.
('6', 240, 4, 19, 437899) No doubt they do, but we must never forget that, if we follow their example, we shall lose our case.
('6', 240, 4, 20, 438000) We should not be surprised if they even expect more from us, for, after all?
('6', 240, 4, 21, 438077) we belong to a different community.
('6', 240, 5, 22, 438113) PERSONAL APPEARANCE
('6', 240, 6, 23, 438133) We should be particular about our personal appearance also.
('6', 240, 6, 24, 438193) A shopkeeper in rags cannot hold his own in Natal or South Africa.
('6', 240, 6, 25, 438260) If you become a trader, you must dress according to local custom.
('6', 240, 6, 26, 438326) It is not necessary to dress in the western fashion.
('6', 240, 6, 27, 438379) But the dress, if in the Indian style, must be clean and decent.
('6', 240, 6, 28, 438444) We would warn Indians that it
('6', 241, 0, 1, 438474) 242 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 241, 1, 2, 438516) is not proper to wear a dhoti in this country.
('6', 241, 1, 3, 438563) In Tongaat shopkeepers and their assistants are seen cleaning their teeth and washing their faces in the street outside their shops, just as they do in our own country.
('6', 241, 1, 4, 438732) It is sheer stupidity to believe that all these things will not prejudice the Europeans.
('6', 241, 1, 5, 438821) When we make our appearance outside the house, we should always be fully dressed.
('6', 241, 1, 6, 438903) [Among us] little attention is given to the condition of the turban or cap and the shoes.
('6', 241, 1, 7, 438993) We assume that, if the head dress is dirty, it is quite in keeping with custom.
('6', 241, 1, 8, 439073) As a rule we do not polish our shoes, and some do not wear socks at all, or if at all they do, the socks are in tatters and double down over the shoes.
('6', 241, 1, 9, 439225) All this must change.
('6', 241, 1, 10, 439247) There is one key to all this.
('6', 241, 1, 11, 439277) Personal activities, such as eating and drinking, washing and toilet, should be in private.
('6', 241, 1, 12, 439369) That is, we should always be in a presentable condition while we are out.
('6', 241, 1, 13, 439443) Similarly, we cannot attend a court or go out in public, chewing tobacco, betel leaves or nuts.
('6', 241, 2, 14, 439539) ACCOUNT BOOKS
('6', 241, 3, 15, 439553) With regard to account books, complaints have appeared in newspapers that the books kept in English are unmethodical and disordered, or that they are false and are intended merely for show.
('6', 241, 3, 16, 439743) We have to admit to our shame that the charge has some substance in it.
('6', 241, 3, 17, 439815) Some simple minded merchants go to the length of getting the books written up at the end of the year.
('6', 241, 3, 18, 439917) How long can we go on with such patchwork?
('6', 241, 3, 19, 439960) Indeed, we should wake up.
('6', 241, 3, 20, 439987) It is not very difficult to keep regular books of account in English.
('6', 241, 3, 21, 440057) The main reasons for not doing so would appear to be laziness and greed.
('6', 241, 3, 22, 440130) We should overcome these weaknesses and start the practice of keeping regular accounts.
('6', 241, 4, 23, 440218) SHOP AND RESIDENCE IN SAME PREMISES
('6', 241, 5, 24, 440254) Many traders set up shop in residential premises.
('6', 241, 5, 25, 440304) Europeans too do it.
('6', 241, 5, 26, 440325) In the villages, one cannot help doing this to some extent.
('6', 241, 5, 27, 440385) Wherever possible, the shop and the place of residence should be separate and at some distance from each other.
('6', 241, 5, 28, 440497) Even if they have to be near each other, they must be separate.
('6', 241, 5, 29, 440561) This should not be done merely by putting up a nominal curtain with the intention of deceiving.
('6', 241, 5, 30, 440657) They should be really kept distinct from each other.
('6', 241, 5, 31, 440710) PROMISE If these three things are attended to, we can promise that the condition of the Indian traders in Natal will improve in a short time, Even if they do not change the law, it will not come into effect.

('6', 242, 1, 2, 440961) might ask what should be done to prevent shops being closed and locked up before all these wise precepts could be attended to.
('6', 242, 1, 3, 441088) It is a pertinent question.
('6', 242, 2, 4, 441116) FOR THE BRAVE ONLY
('6', 242, 3, 5, 441135) Natal and South Africa are for brave Indians only.
('6', 242, 3, 6, 441186) It is being proved every day that the coward and the miser are doomed.
('6', 242, 3, 7, 441257) The answer, then, to the question is this: those merchants whose account books are in order, whose shops are clean and decent, whose dress is becoming and whose place of residence is clean and separate from the shop, will continue to run their shops even if they do not get the licence and lose the appeal.
('6', 242, 3, 8, 441564) It will be possible to have their cases fought out in England and secure a favourable decision.
('6', 242, 3, 9, 441660) It is certain that men of courage will be able to do all this.

('6', 242, 7, 13, 441807) The Natal Mercury has come out in favour of Indian traders.
('6', 242, 7, 14, 441867) The gist of its argument is that those who oppose Indian traders are hypocrites.
('6', 242, 7, 15, 441948) This means that, though ostensibly they are opposed to Indians, they do in fact have dealings with us.
('6', 242, 7, 16, 442051) The Mercury also believes that, if the Europeans are really opposed to the Indians, the latter cannot hold out for long.
('6', 242, 7, 17, 442172) For, says The Mercury, it is only because Europeans sell land to Indians that the latter can buy it, and that it is because Europeans lend them money and buy goods from them that Indians can carry on trade.
('6', 242, 7, 18, 442379) There is much force in this argument.
('6', 242, 7, 19, 442417) It was on the basis of this that the Deputation to England argued with Lord Elgin and Mr. Morley that, if the Europeans were really opposed to the Indians, they could boycott the matter.
('6', 242, 7, 20, 442604) We advise everyone to support the talk of boycott.
('6', 242, 7, 21, 442655) It will probably bring about a breakdown of law.
('6', 242, 7, 22, 442704) There are many things which Indians have to fight against, and if the laws made against us break down, we shall be able to cope with other problems on one condition, namely, that we overcome our drawbacks.
('6', 242, 7, 23, 442910) On that point, we have written at some length already, which readers may please look up.
('6', 242, 7, 24, 442999) No one should be afraid of a boycott, for it is such that, if the Europeans start it, we cannot save ourselves in spite of any laws
('6', 243, 0, 1, 443131) 244 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 243, 1, 2, 443173) that may be made to protect us.
('6', 243, 1, 3, 443205) The best thing for us will be to face it out.
('6', 243, 1, 4, 443251) In Boksburg Europeans have no dealings with us, with the result that no Indian can go there though, under the law, every one has a right to do so.
('6', 243, 1, 5, 443398) Where the Indian population is well settled, a boycott cannot be effective if we acquit ourselves well.

('6', 243, 5, 9, 443569) SELF GOVERNMENT IN THE TRANSVAAL
('6', 243, 6, 10, 443602) Lord Selborne has been re appointed Governor of the Transvaal under the new Constitution.
('6', 243, 6, 11, 443692) The post of Lieutenant Governor has now been abolished altogether.
('6', 243, 6, 12, 443759) Those desiring to contest the election to the new parliament will file their nomination papers with the respective magistrates on February 9. People will go to the polls on the 20th.
('6', 243, 7, 13, 443942) WHAT IS RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT?
('6', 243, 8, 14, 443974) It will not be out of place here to explain the significance of the change now introduced in the Transvaal.
('6', 243, 8, 15, 444082) In the British Empire, there are three types of territories outside Great Britain, viz., self governing colonies, Crown colonies and dependencies.
('6', 243, 8, 16, 444229) India is among the dependencies.
('6', 243, 8, 17, 444262) Crown colonies includeMauritius,Ceylon, etc.
('6', 243, 8, 18, 444307) Natal, Canada, Australia, etc., are among the self governing colonies.
('6', 243, 8, 19, 444378) In a Crown colony there is generally a legislative body either elected by the people or nominated by the government.
('6', 243, 8, 20, 444495) Officials are appointed only by the government, the legislature has no con trol over them and they are in no way responsible to the members.
('6', 243, 8, 21, 444636) All laws are regarded as having been enacted by the government.
('6', 243, 8, 22, 444700) Self government is said to have been conferred on a people when power is transferred to it and it acquires the authority to appoint officers, levy taxes and enact laws.
('6', 243, 8, 23, 444869) The British control over self governing colonies is very slight.
('6', 243, 8, 24, 444934) Their legislation requires Royal assent, but if the Crown should refuse the assent, there is always the probability that these countries may declare their independence.
('6', 243, 8, 25, 445103) Many experienced politicians believe that self governing colonies will become independent in a few years.
('6', 243, 8, 26, 445209) Till recently the Transvaal was a Crown Colony, but it has now become self governing.
('6', 243, 8, 27, 445295) Under it the
('6', 244, 0, 1, 445308) VOL. 6: 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 245
('6', 244, 1, 2, 445351) members elected by the people can question the doings of the officials; it is therefore also called responsible government.
('6', 244, 2, 3, 445475) ELECTION CAMPAIGN
('6', 244, 3, 4, 445493) The election campaign has gone on for some weeks now.
('6', 244, 3, 5, 445547) At the meetings sometimes they almost come to blows.
('6', 244, 3, 6, 445600) Voters at times ask such absurd questions that one wonders whether such an election should be considered a sign of civilization or barbarism.
('6', 244, 3, 7, 445742) Mr. Hosken is a rich, noble and well known gentleman of this place.
('6', 244, 3, 8, 445810) His opponent can in no way be considered his equal.
('6', 244, 3, 9, 445862) The electors do not seem to have considered whether Mr. Hosken is a man likely to do good or harm to the public.
('6', 244, 3, 10, 445975) They asked him the question where he obtained his provisions from.
('6', 244, 3, 11, 446042) One need not be surprised if the fate of Hoskens election should hang on the answer to this question.
('6', 244, 3, 12, 446144) The electors are in such a benighted condition.
('6', 244, 3, 13, 446192) This is only an example or the questions asked.
('6', 244, 3, 14, 446240) One can cite many more instances.
('6', 244, 4, 15, 446274) LAW RELATING TO NON WHITES IN ORANGE RIVER COLONY
('6', 244, 5, 16, 446324) A Bill, intended to protect the rights of the Coloured people through a white, appointed to represent them, has been published in the Orange River Colony Government Gazette.
('6', 244, 5, 17, 446498) Many municipalities have, according to Press telegrams received here, opposed the measure.
('6', 244, 5, 18, 446589) The right which the Government proposed to grant was without any substance.
('6', 244, 5, 19, 446665) But the white members of the brave municipa lities of the Orange River Colony have opposed it as they were afraid that the Coloured people were being accorded a respectable status by the grant of this right, such as it was.
('6', 244, 5, 20, 446889) It is very disturbing to think what the plight of the Coloured people would be under such men.
('6', 244, 6, 21, 446984) PEREIRAS SON
('6', 244, 7, 22, 446997) Dr. Pereira, who is working here as a private interpreter, has a son studying in England.
('6', 244, 7, 23, 447087) He has passed his school examination and got a certificate for being the best behaved among the students.
('6', 244, 7, 24, 447193) He will shortly proceed to Scotland to study medicine.
('6', 244, 8, 25, 447248) SIR RICHARD SOLOMON
('6', 244, 9, 26, 447268) On Monday Sir Richard Solomon made a speech at a crowded meeting in the Pretoria Town Hall.
('6', 244, 9, 27, 447360) I cannot give a full account of that speech this time, but intend doing so next week.
('6', 244, 9, 28, 447446) 1 He has now spoken

('6', 245, 0, 1, 447504) 246 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 245, 1, 2, 447546) out his mind.
('6', 245, 1, 3, 447560) Regarding the Asiatic Ordinance, he gave out that the Imperial Government would give its assent to the Ordinance if it was passed by the new parliament.
('6', 245, 1, 4, 447713) The only inference to be drawn from this is that the Ordinance will certainly be passed in six or seven months.
('6', 245, 1, 5, 447825) In that case it is probable that Indians will have yet to go and enjoy life in the prison palace.
('6', 245, 1, 6, 447923) However, I shall discuss this point further next week.
('6', 245, 2, 7, 447978) INTERNAL FEUD 1
('6', 245, 3, 8, 447994) A long telegram from the Durban correspondent of The Star states that a split has occurred in the local Indian community.
('6', 245, 3, 9, 448116) It adds that the Congress is regarded as belonging to the Muslims, and that the Colonial born or civilized Indians, being displeased, are thinking of founding a separate body.
('6', 245, 3, 10, 448292) It is suspected that there must be some white person behind all this.
('6', 245, 3, 11, 448362) From the wording of the telegram it appears that the writer is anxious to create dissensions among Indians.
('6', 245, 3, 12, 448470) People in Durban may know more about this.
('6', 245, 4, 13, 448513) ASIATIC ORDINANCE It is clear from the local newspapers that the Asiatic Ordinance of the Transvaal is not dead, but is only in a state of coma.
('6', 245, 4, 14, 448658) At a meeting in Krugersdorp it was suggested that the matter should be taken up again in the Municipal Association; and as soon as the new government is formed, the Municipal Assoc iation should pass and forward a resolution [to demand] that the selfsame Ordinance be passed by the new legislature, and that Lord Elgin should give his assent to it.
('6', 245, 4, 15, 449007) Such discussions have been going on not only at Krugers dorp, but throughout the Transvaal.
('6', 245, 4, 16, 449099) The Indian community therefore needs to remain alert.
('6', 245, 4, 17, 449153) People seem to have gone to sleep, elated by the rejection of the Ordinance; we should be wide awake.

('6', 246, 2, 3, 449450) CHAPTER IV: IS THERE A HIGHER LAW?
('6', 246, 3, 4, 449485) We constantly pronounce judgements upon the value of actions.
('6', 246, 3, 5, 449547) Some actions satisfy us and others do not.
('6', 246, 3, 6, 449590) Whether a certain act is good or bad does not depend upon whether it is beneficial or harmful to us.
('6', 246, 3, 7, 449691) In judging it, we adopt quite a different standard.
('6', 246, 3, 8, 449743) We have in our minds certain ideas and on the basis of those we judge the acts of others.
('6', 246, 3, 9, 449833) Whether any wrong done by one to another affects us or not, we do feel it to be wrong.
('6', 246, 3, 10, 449920) Sometimes we have a trace of sympathy for the wrongdoer; but despite that sympathy, we feel no hesitation at all in pronouncing his act to be wrong.
('6', 246, 3, 11, 450069) It may be that at times our judgement is found to be mistaken.
('6', 246, 3, 12, 450132) We cannot always fathom a mans motives, and may thus judge him wrongly.
('6', 246, 3, 13, 450204) Neverth eless, we find no difficulty in judging an act in so far as the intention is known.
('6', 246, 3, 14, 450296) Even if our personal interests are sometimes served by wrong actions, we do feel inwardly that they are wrong.
('6', 246, 3, 15, 450407) Thus it is established that the rightness or wrongness of an act does not depend upon a mans self interest.
('6', 246, 3, 16, 450515) Nor does it depend upon his wishes.
('6', 246, 3, 17, 450551) There is a difference between morality and sympathy.
('6', 246, 3, 18, 450604) Out of sympathy for the child we wish to give it a certain thing, but if the thing is harmful to the child, we hold it immoral to give it.
('6', 246, 3, 19, 450743) It is doubtless good to show sympathy but, unrestricted by moral considerations, it turns into poison.
('6', 246, 3, 20, 450846) We see also that moral laws are immutable.
('6', 246, 3, 21, 450889) Opinions change, but not morality.
('6', 246, 3, 22, 450924) When our eyes are open, we see the sun; when they are closed, it is not seen.
('6', 246, 3, 23, 451002) The change here has been in our sense of sight, not in the fact of the suns existence.
('6', 246, 3, 24, 451089) The same holds true of moral laws.
('6', 246, 3, 25, 451124) It is probable that in a state of ignorance we do not know what is moral; but once the eye of knowledge is opened, there is no difficulty in knowing it.
('6', 246, 3, 26, 451277) Men rarely care to see single mindedly the right or wrong of things; often prompted by personal considerations, they mistakenly describe the immoral as moral.
('6', 246, 3, 27, 451436) The time is yet to come when men, freeing themselves from self regarding considerations, will concentrate their attention on the ideas of morality alone.
('6', 246, 3, 28, 451590) Moral culture is still in its mere infancy; it is as science was before the birth of a Bacon or a Darwin.
('6', 246, 3, 29, 451696) Men were eager to know what the truth was.
('6', 246, 3, 30, 451739) Instead of inquiring into morality, they have been hitherto engaged in
('6', 247, 0, 1, 451810) 248 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 247, 1, 2, 451852) discovering laws of naturethe laws of the earths motion, etc.
('6', 247, 1, 3, 451914) Where do we find the disinterested student of mora lity, patient and painstaking, who, setting aside his earlier superstitious notions, devotes his life to seeking only the ideal good?
('6', 247, 1, 4, 452099) When men become as eager to explore the world of moral ideas as they are now to explore the realms of nature, we shall be able to bring together the various conceptions of morality.
('6', 247, 1, 5, 452281) It is unlikely that, on ideas of morality, there will be the same divergence of opinion as exists among men on matters of science.
('6', 247, 1, 6, 452412) However, we may not for a time arrive at unanimity of opinion regarding moral laws.
('6', 247, 1, 7, 452496) This does not, however, mean that it is impossible to distinguish between right and wrong.
('6', 247, 1, 8, 452587) We thus see that, independent of and apart from mens wishes and opinions, there is something like a moral standard which we may call moral law.
('6', 247, 1, 9, 452731) If there are laws of the state, why may not there be a moral law too?
('6', 247, 1, 10, 452801) It does not matter if that law is not committed to writing by man, and indeed it need not be.
('6', 247, 1, 11, 452895) If we grant or hold that the moral law exists, it is incumbent on us to obey it, just as we ought to obey the law of the state.
('6', 247, 1, 12, 453023) A moral law is distinct from and better than the laws of the state or those of business.
('6', 247, 1, 13, 453112) One may ask, How does it matter if I do not obey the laws of business and remain poor?
('6', 247, 1, 14, 453199) Or if I disobey the laws of the state and incur the rulers displea sure? But it will never do either for me or anyone else  to say, What does it matter whether I tell a lie or tell the truth? There is thus a great difference between moral laws and temporal laws.
('6', 247, 1, 15, 453462) For morality dwells in our hearts.
('6', 247, 1, 16, 453497) Even a man practising immorality would admit that he has been immoral.
('6', 247, 1, 17, 453568) A wrong can never become right.
('6', 247, 1, 18, 453600) Even where a people is vile, though men may not observe the moral law, they would make a pretence of doing so; they thus are obliged to admit that moral laws ought to be observed.
('6', 247, 1, 19, 453780) Such is the greatness of morality.
('6', 247, 1, 20, 453815) It cares not for custom nor for public opinion.
('6', 247, 1, 21, 453863) To a moral man, public opinion or custom is binding only so long as it is in harmony with the moral law.
('6', 247, 1, 22, 453968) Where does this moral law come from?
('6', 247, 1, 23, 454005) This law is not laid down by the state, for different laws are found in different states.
('6', 247, 1, 24, 454095) Many men were opposed to the morality which Socrates observed in his day.
('6', 247, 1, 25, 454169) Even so the world admits that the morality he observed has remained, and shall remain, morality for ever.
('6', 247, 1, 26, 454275) Robert Browning says, If ever Satan proclaimed the law of hatred and untruth in the world, even then
('6', 248, 0, 1, 454376) VOL. 6: 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 249
('6', 248, 1, 2, 454419) justice, goodness and truth will continue to be divine. 1 One may conclude from this that the moral law is supreme and divine.
('6', 248, 1, 3, 454546) Such a law no people or individual can violate to the end of time.
('6', 248, 1, 4, 454613) As has been said, even as the dangerous storm ultimately passes, immoral men must meet their destruction.
('6', 248, 2, 5, 454719) No sooner did the cup of sin in Assyria and Babylon become full than it broke.
('6', 248, 2, 6, 454798) When Rome trod the path of immorality, none of her great men could save her.
('6', 248, 2, 7, 454875) The ancient Greeks were an accom plished people, still all their art and philosophy could not continue in their immorality for long.
('6', 248, 2, 8, 455008) The French Revolution was but an insurrec tion against immorality.
('6', 248, 2, 9, 455075) The same was the case with America.
('6', 248, 2, 10, 455111) The good Wendell Phillips used to say that immorality even if enthroned will not endure.
('6', 248, 2, 11, 455200) This mysterious moral law brings prosperity to the man who observes it: it sustains the family that obeys it, and the community which lives by it ever flourishes.
('6', 248, 2, 12, 455363) Freedom, peace and happiness are the lot of the nation that lets itself be ruled by this highest law.

('6', 249, 3, 4, 455935) Mrs. Besant has written an article for the December issue of Indian Review on Nationor as we have put it, How to Build a Nationwhich deserves to be read carefully by all the communities in india are now bent on making India a single nation and improving in the country have put forward their urge well known people in the country have put forward their ideas on the subject.
('6', 249, 3, 5, 456310) Mrs. Besant is President of the Theosophical Society and spends six months in India each year and the other six in England.
('6', 249, 3, 6, 456434) She enjoys the reputation of being one of the worlds great orators and most of her writings, too, are very instructive.
('6', 249, 3, 7, 456554) As this article by her is serious and thought provoking, we here publish a translation of it.

('6', 249, 8, 12, 456755) CHHAGANLAL,
('6', 249, 9, 13, 456767) Your letter to hand.
('6', 249, 9, 14, 456788) As a lot of material has been held over, Mrs. Besants article 2
('6', 249, 10, 15, 456852) may well be postponed to next week.
('6', 249, 10, 16, 456888) Whenever you print it, see that all of it appears in one issue.
('6', 249, 10, 17, 456952) It may conveniently be held over for two weeks.It would be better if the article on the Amir 3 were concluded in this issue.
('6', 249, 10, 18, 457077) The suggestion about decreasing your burden is quite justified.
('6', 249, 10, 19, 457141) Do keep Mothoo.
('6', 249, 10, 20, 457157) You would be quite right if you had already decided to keep him before this reached you.
('6', 249, 10, 21, 457246) This is the time for you to give your fullest attention to realizing the dues and to the account books.
('6', 249, 10, 22, 457350) We must on any account satisfy

('6', 250, 1, 2, 457557) our customers.
('6', 250, 1, 3, 457572) If they do not get satisfaction just when they have begun to be interested in what we write, we shant be able to keep them on the register.
('6', 250, 1, 4, 457712) It is [however] as necessary to collect the dues as it is to satisfy our customers.
('6', 250, 1, 5, 457796) You must therefore give full attention to the books.
('6', 250, 1, 6, 457849) I realize this quite well.
('6', 250, 1, 7, 457876) You will be justified therefore if you have decided to keep Thakkar by offering him an increment.
('6', 250, 1, 8, 457974) He can be cured of his bad habit if you keep an eye on him.
('6', 250, 1, 9, 458034) When will the balance sheet be ready?
('6', 250, 1, 10, 458072) I am returning Sheth Haji Habibs advertisement about the mosque.
('6', 250, 1, 11, 458137) I have written to him.
('6', 250, 1, 12, 458160) I hope you remember that 6.10.0 have already been collected from him.
('6', 250, 1, 13, 458230) A credit note for the amount has been sent to him.
('6', 250, 1, 14, 458281) I am sending you some more material today.
('6', 250, 1, 15, 458324) Do not hold over anything that is topical.
('6', 250, 1, 16, 458367) Even though the expenditure on your visit to England is ultimately to be borne by the Press, I know that the money will have to be found by me now, and this is how I look at the matter.
('6', 250, 1, 17, 458553) The Press is growing day by day.
('6', 250, 1, 18, 458586) Its work will increase as the purity of our objectives is progressively recognized and increases.
('6', 250, 1, 19, 458684) If this purity is accompanied by skill and ability, we shall be able to do a great deal, provided of course that we do not succumb to greed and self interest.
('6', 250, 1, 20, 458843) For this we should lay down that no one among us could draw a monthly allowance of more than 10 or up to any other limit we decide upon.
('6', 250, 1, 21, 458980) Whatever is left over after these charges have been met, we should use to promote education, health, etc.
('6', 250, 1, 22, 459086) In order to do this we should ourselves be better educated.
('6', 250, 1, 23, 459146) I have therefore decided to send a person to England, whom I consider the most steadfast of all.
('6', 250, 1, 24, 459243) He should go there with the firm resolve that he would not make a single pie for himself from the education he receives, but would pass on all the benefit [of that education] to the Press and would accept and live on what the Press gave him.
('6', 250, 1, 25, 459485) You appear to me to be the only Indian who has attained to this degree of fitness.
('6', 250, 1, 26, 459568) I believe you understand the significance of the whole thing and you seem to be the only person who can be depended upon to carry forward the heritage of my thoughts and words.
('6', 250, 1, 27, 459745) Messrs Polak and West know and understand a lot.
('6', 250, 1, 28, 459794) There are things which they understand and you dont.
('6', 250, 1, 29, 459847) However, it seems on the whole that you understand more than
('6', 251, 0, 1, 459908) 252 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 251, 1, 2, 459950) they do.
('6', 251, 1, 3, 459959) Our ultimate capital is not the money we have, but our courage, our faith, our truthfulness and our ability.
('6', 251, 1, 4, 460068) If therefore you go to England, your intellect remains unspoiled and you return with your physical and mental powers strengthened, our capital will have appreciated to that extent.
('6', 251, 1, 5, 460249) I cannot write more as people have again begun to drop in.

('6', 251, 6, 10, 460431) [Before January 29 1907] Mr. Madanjit has started, in Rangoon, an English journal entitled United Burma of which we have received the first few issues.
('6', 251, 6, 11, 460583) His aim in starting the paper is to bring together the Burmese people and seek the redress of their grievances from the Government.
('6', 251, 6, 12, 460715) Through the paper he also hopes to persuade the Burmese people to take part in the activities of the [Indian National] Congress.
('6', 251, 6, 13, 460844) This is no doubt a great venture by Mr. Madanjit, to which every one will wish godspeed.
('6', 251, 6, 14, 460933) From the large number of advertisements which it has been able to secure from Englishmen as well as Indians, it would seem that the paper enjoys a wide patronage.
('6', 251, 6, 15, 461096) The address of the paper is No.
('6', 251, 6, 16, 461128) 29, 27th Street, Rangoon; the annual subscription is Rs. 6; the price of a copy is three annas.

('6', 251, 10, 21, 461363) CHHAGANLAL,
('6', 251, 11, 22, 461375) I have your letter.
('6', 251, 11, 23, 461395) Please read what I have written to West about Hindi and Tamil [columns].
('6', 251, 11, 24, 461468) I note what you say about Miss West.
('6', 251, 11, 25, 461505) Do what you think right.
('6', 251, 11, 26, 461530) It is not an example to be copied.
('6', 251, 11, 27, 461565) I find that the office here has run into a great loss.

('6', 252, 1, 2, 461672) therefore get a moments respite.
('6', 252, 1, 3, 461705) Kalyandas 1 must be at Newcastle today.
('6', 252, 1, 4, 461745) He has suddenly developed some pain in his hand.
('6', 252, 1, 5, 461794) However he intends to complete his work.
('6', 252, 1, 6, 461835) I have wired to him to put off his visit to the other places.
('6', 252, 1, 7, 461897) I have not yet had any reply.
('6', 252, 1, 8, 461927) Please take good care of his hand.
('6', 252, 1, 9, 461962) I have already written to you about dispensing with Medhs services.
('6', 252, 1, 10, 462030) I am sending today the rest of the article on the Amir (pages 44 73).
('6', 252, 1, 11, 462100) It is in continuation of the previous instalment.

('6', 252, 7, 18, 462352) Yours to hand.
('6', 252, 7, 19, 462367) I enclose herewith Desais letter.
('6', 252, 7, 20, 462401) If Mothoo has not yet come and if you know Nathalal and consider him suitable for our work, write to Desai.
('6', 252, 7, 21, 462509) I have written to him asking him to write to you.
('6', 252, 7, 22, 462559) We must have one person well trained before you leave.
('6', 252, 7, 23, 462614) It would be nice if this could be Maganlal.
('6', 252, 8, 24, 462658) I have thought of the Bar for you.
('6', 252, 8, 25, 462693) If you have to say anything about it or suggest something else, do write to me.
('6', 252, 8, 26, 462773) There is likely to be one difficulty in your going [to study] for the Bar, namely, it will entail an additional expenditure of 150. If we decide that you should study law, you can take the LL.B. degree of London University.
('6', 252, 8, 27, 462997) Please let me know what you think about all these things.
('6', 252, 8, 28, 463055) I received the Pretoria list yesterday and have sent it to Gaurishankar.

('6', 253, 1, 3, 463343) I have written earlier about Madanjit too.
('6', 253, 2, 4, 463386) I send herewith the letter about drinking after making corrections; you may print it.
('6', 253, 3, 5, 463472) I am trying to find Urdu poems bearing on Ethical Religion.
('6', 253, 3, 6, 463532) I have not yet come across any.
('6', 253, 3, 7, 463564) I hope to send one next week.
('6', 253, 3, 8, 463594) The first poem you have sent to me does not strike me as appropriate.
('6', 253, 3, 9, 463664) We want to give poems which do not start a controversy.
('6', 253, 3, 10, 463720) I shall be able to send a reply if the letter, about the Colonial Secretary is sent to me.
('6', 253, 3, 11, 463811) Please send the Act along with the letter.
('6', 253, 3, 12, 463854) I am sending a demand draft for 35 in favour of you and West.
('6', 253, 3, 13, 463916) It is good that Anandlal 4 has got started.
('6', 253, 3, 14, 463960) I have already written all I had to say about Thakkar.
('6', 253, 3, 15, 464015) If he goes away, I believe we shall be losing a very good hand.
('6', 253, 3, 16, 464079) On the whole, Ithink he is all right; and we shall not be able to get another man as well informed in the near future.
('6', 253, 3, 17, 464198) However, you may let him go if he does not stay even on 5. Please let me know where Maganlal bought the type in Bombay, and in what condition it was received here.
('6', 253, 3, 18, 464362) Also let me know if there would be any objection to our getting the type this time from the Gujarati Foundry.
('6', 253, 3, 19, 464472) I came to know from Harilal yesterday that the money had not been paid for the tea we bought from Sanghavi nor was the bill credited to him in our books.
('6', 253, 3, 20, 464626) Please tell me what you know about this, and pay up the bill for the tea if it has not been already paid.
('6', 253, 3, 21, 464732) I have sent Manilal the Sanskrit book he wanted.
('6', 253, 3, 22, 464781) What does he propose to do with it?
('6', 253, 3, 23, 464817) Please let me know how he is getting on with his studies, how he is working in the Press, etc.

('6', 254, 2, 3, 465228) JOHANNESBURG January 31, 1907
('6', 254, 3, 4, 465258) MY DEAR CHHAGANLAL,
('6', 254, 4, 5, 465278) I have your letter and the list.
('6', 254, 4, 6, 465311) We have to publish, on Mr. Adamji Miankhans 1 departure, his photograph as a supplement, and we have also to give a brief account of his life.
('6', 254, 4, 7, 465454) The account I shall send from here.
('6', 254, 4, 8, 465490) I have asked Mr. Adamji to let us have his photograph.
('6', 254, 4, 9, 465545) He will send one on to you there.
('6', 254, 4, 10, 465579) As soon as it arrives, you should have the block made, so that we can make use of it when necessary and may not be rushed.
('6', 254, 4, 11, 465702) I should like you to let me have the total of complimentary copies and the total of exchanges we send, dividing [them] into two heads, complimentary copies and exchanges for Natal, and [those for places] outside Natal.
('6', 254, 4, 12, 465921) The receipts for January are not quite bad.
('6', 254, 4, 13, 465965) In the expenditure for the month, you have not shown the wages at all.
('6', 254, 4, 14, 466036) Has the balance sheet been started?
('6', 254, 4, 15, 466072) Who is to form the riddles, before we can think of prizes?
('6', 254, 4, 16, 466131) Personally, I am of the opinion that we are not yet ripe for branching out in this direction.
('6', 254, 4, 17, 466225) What prescription has Dr. Nanji given for Kalyandas, and what reason does he assign for the sores on the hands?
('6', 254, 4, 18, 466337) I have duly received your list of advertisers for Johannesburg.
('6', 254, 4, 19, 466401) They have all consented to pay.
('6', 254, 4, 20, 466433) Chhotabhai has already paid; you must have received the Credit Note.
('6', 254, 4, 21, 466502) Please inquire and let me know whether you have or not.
('6', 254, 4, 22, 466558) The others will pay.
('6', 254, 4, 23, 466579) You may, therefore, continue the advertisements.
('6', 254, 4, 24, 466628) It would be very good if you could collect the 3 from Mrs. Jamieson.
('6', 254, 4, 25, 466697) I feel that I should refund the 3 to Vyas.
('6', 254, 4, 26, 466740) Henceforth, you should not give notes of introduction to men in whom you cannot put a reasonable trust.
('6', 254, 4, 27, 466844) Do not overwork yourself.
('6', 254, 4, 28, 466870) What about Mothoo?
('6', 254, 4, 29, 466889) I have not yet received the Parsee Chronicle or the Patrika.
('6', 254, 4, 30, 466950) The names of subscribers against which you have put a cross should be retained

('6', 255, 1, 3, 467267) The others may be struck off.
('6', 255, 1, 4, 467297) I will, however, inquire.
('6', 255, 1, 5, 467323) I am glad you had the meeting on Sunday.
('6', 255, 1, 6, 467364) How did the ladies take it?
('6', 255, 1, 7, 467392) What did they understand?
('6', 255, 1, 8, 467418) What pains were taken to explain to them what was read?
('6', 255, 1, 9, 467474) Who gave the explanations?
('6', 255, 1, 10, 467501) Where was the meeting held?
('6', 255, 1, 11, 467529) It is a step absolutely in the right direction?
('6', 255, 1, 12, 467577) and should be continued at any cost.

('6', 255, 5, 16, 467696) 240. INDIANS IN THE TRANSVAAL
('6', 255, 6, 17, 467726) We invite the attention of every Indian to the speech by Sir Richard Solomon translated into Gujarati by our Johannesburg correspondent.
('6', 255, 6, 18, 467863) 1 When Sir Richard makes a public speech, we should know that it is not for electioneering purposes only.
('6', 255, 6, 19, 467969) He has just returned from England.
('6', 255, 6, 20, 468004) He has met officials in the Colonial Office in London, and he is a favourite of theirs.
('6', 255, 6, 21, 468092) Through him, the Liberal Government desires to unite the Dutch and the English.
('6', 255, 6, 22, 468172) It is necessary, therefore, to look upon whatever Sir Richard says at this juncture as important.
('6', 255, 6, 23, 468270) Sir Richard says that the Asiatic Ordinance will have to be reintroduced in the new parliament, and that the Imperial Government will not reject an act passed by it.
('6', 255, 6, 24, 468436) Not only would Sir Richard have such a law passed, but, according to his line of thinking, no new Indian should beallowed to enter and settle in the Transvaal.
('6', 255, 6, 25, 468596) Sir Richard does not therefore like the Natal or the Cape immigration laws.
('6', 255, 6, 26, 468672) He would have the Orange River Colony law 2 enacted in the Transvaal.
('6', 255, 6, 27, 468742) This means that, if the reins of government were to pass into the hands of Sir Richard, Indians would face very hard times indeed.
('6', 255, 6, 28, 468873) What are we to do in this situation?
('6', 255, 6, 29, 468910) We have only one answer.
('6', 255, 6, 30, 468935) We have hailed the refusal of assent to the Asiatic Ordinance as a victory.
('6', 255, 6, 31, 469011) But true victory will come only when we show our strength.
('6', 255, 7, 32, 469070) 1 Vide Johannesburg Letter, 2 2 1907. 2 Under the law an Indian could enter the Orange River Colony only as a domestic servant.
('6', 256, 0, 1, 469198) VOL. 6: 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 257
('6', 256, 1, 2, 469241) certain that the Asiatic Ordinance will be re introduced.
('6', 256, 1, 3, 469299) When that happens, there should be only one thought in the mind of every Indian: never to accept such a law.
('6', 256, 1, 4, 469408) And, if it is enforced, he will rather go to gaol than carry a pass like a Kaffir.
('6', 256, 1, 5, 469491) True victory will be won only when the entire Indian community courageously marches to the gaolwhen the time comesand stays there as if it were a palace.
('6', 256, 1, 6, 469645) Many things have to be done before this can come to pass.
('6', 256, 1, 7, 469703) We must show that Indians without permits do not enter the Transvaal in large numbers.
('6', 256, 1, 8, 469790) If any of them try to enter, they must be stopped from doing so.
('6', 256, 1, 9, 469855) And the whites must be made to realize that their policy of repression is not at all called for.

('6', 256, 5, 13, 470015) Mr. Theodore Morison, who is a member of the South Africa British Indian Committee, has now been appointed a member of the India Council by Mr. Morley.
('6', 256, 5, 14, 470167) Mr. Morison was the Principal of the Aligarh College.
('6', 256, 5, 15, 470221) On some matters he holds liberal views.
('6', 256, 5, 16, 470261) He comes of a noble family.
('6', 256, 5, 17, 470289) This appointment made by Mr. Morley is a novel step.
('6', 256, 5, 18, 470342) So far, all the members of this Council have invariably been Anglo Indian officials, but Mr. Morison is not from that class.
('6', 256, 5, 19, 470467) This musttherefore be regarded as a major change made by Mr. Morley in the set up of the Council.

('6', 256, 9, 23, 470631) A cable has been received saying that Sir James Fergusson, a former Governor of Bombay, was killed, having been buried alive in an earthquake in Jamaica.
('6', 256, 9, 24, 470785) He greatly encouraged education in the Bombay Presidency.
('6', 256, 9, 25, 470843) Before leaving for Jamaica he had accepted the Presidentship of the South Africa British Indian Committee.
('6', 256, 9, 26, 470950) He was buried in Kingston with great honours.

('6', 257, 1, 2, 471079) 243. NAUSEA
('6', 257, 2, 3, 471091) Generally speaking, every person has an aversion to something or the other.
('6', 257, 2, 4, 471167) To some the sight of blood or pus is nauseating, to others the smell of kerosene.
('6', 257, 2, 5, 471249) Similarly, an Englishman is averse to certain things.
('6', 257, 2, 6, 471303) Of these aversions some are desirable, but others are carried too far.
('6', 257, 2, 7, 471374) None the less, it is a fact that people do have these aversions.
('6', 257, 2, 8, 471439) Trivial as some of these may seem, we should know what they are.
('6', 257, 2, 9, 471504) It often happens that, starting from trifles, people go on to big quarrels.
('6', 257, 2, 10, 471580) Because of trifles the whites sometimes cause havoc.
('6', 257, 2, 11, 471633) We know of an instance in which a white man kicked an Indian simply because the latter happened to break wind.
('6', 257, 2, 12, 471744) Once Mr. Miller, a Magistrate of the Amlazi Court, was so sickened at the sight of an Indian witness hiccuping that he could stand it no longer and asked the Indian to stop.
('6', 257, 2, 13, 471918) Once an Indian and some Europeans were at dinner table.
('6', 257, 2, 14, 471974) During the meal the Indian started belching.
('6', 257, 2, 15, 472019) An English lady at the table almost fainted and could not eat at all that day.
('6', 257, 2, 16, 472098) We can see from these instances how necessary it is for us always to show consideration for the feelings of others.
('6', 257, 2, 17, 472214) Also, while we live in this country, we should so behave that the whites prejudices against us are weakened.
('6', 257, 2, 18, 472323) With this end in view, we list below some of the causes of their prejudice and appeal to all Indians to overcome them.
('6', 257, 3, 19, 472442) SOME DONTS
('6', 257, 4, 20, 472453) 1. Avoid, as far as possible, blowing your nose or spitting on swept or paved walks or in the presence of others.
('6', 257, 5, 21, 472567) On hygienic grounds also, this rule is worth observing.
('6', 257, 5, 22, 472623) Doctors say that sometimes serious diseases are caused by contact with the nasal or oral discharge of another.
('6', 257, 5, 23, 472734) Dr. Murison has said that we often spread tuberculosis through our habit of spitting anywhere.
('6', 257, 5, 24, 472829) Both these things should be done into a spittoon while at home, and into a handkerchief while out, and, as far as possible, in privacy.
('6', 257, 6, 25, 472965) 2. One should not belch, hiccup, break wind, or scratch oneself in the presence of others.
('6', 257, 7, 26, 473056) These [maxims] are useful for correct social behaviour.
('6', 257, 7, 27, 473112) By practice one can learn to check ones instinct to do any of these things.
('6', 257, 8, 28, 473188) 3. If you want to cough, do so holding your handkerchief
('6', 258, 0, 1, 473245) VOL. 6: 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 259
('6', 258, 1, 2, 473288) against the mouth.
('6', 258, 2, 3, 473307) If ones spittle gets blown on to others, it annoys them and if one has any disease, the spittle carries it to them.
('6', 258, 3, 4, 473423) 4. Even after a bath, in many men, some dirt remains in the ears or under the nails.
('6', 258, 3, 5, 473508) It is necessary to pare ones nails and keep them as well as the ears clean.
('6', 258, 4, 6, 473584) 5. Those who do not grow a regular beard should, if necessary, shave every day.
('6', 258, 4, 7, 473664) An unshaven face is a sign of laziness or stinginess.
('6', 258, 5, 8, 473718) 6. One should not let mucus accumulate in the corners of the eyes.
('6', 258, 5, 9, 473785) One who allows this to happen is considered slothful and a sleepyhead.
('6', 258, 6, 10, 473856) 7. Every act of cleaning the body should be done in privacy.
('6', 258, 7, 11, 473917) 8. The turban or cap and the shoes should be clean.
('6', 258, 7, 12, 473969) The life of the shoes is prolonged by cleaning and polishing.
('6', 258, 8, 13, 474031) 9. Those who chew betel leaf and nut should do so at fixed hours, as with other kinds of food so as to avoid giving the impression that we are eating all the time.
('6', 258, 8, 14, 474195) Those who chew tobacco have a lot to think about.
('6', 258, 8, 15, 474245) They disfigure every spot by spitting.
('6', 258, 8, 16, 474284) Addicts to tobacco, as the Gujarati proverb goes, spoil the corner of the house where they chew tobacco, the whole house if they smoke and their clothes if they take snuff.
('6', 258, 9, 17, 474457) These are rules for personal cleanliness.
('6', 258, 9, 18, 474499) Later we shall write of those relating to the home and its environs.

('6', 258, 13, 22, 474634) SIR RICHARD SOLOMONS SPEECH
('6', 258, 14, 23, 474662) I have already written of Sir Richard Solomons election speech 1
('6', 258, 15, 24, 474727) at Pretoria on January 21 and said I would give, in translation, his ideas on Coloured persons.
('6', 258, 15, 25, 474823) I do so today.

('6', 259, 0, 1, 474916) 260 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 259, 1, 2, 474958) ASIATIC ORDINANCE Now I come to the question of Asiatics, which is related to that of the Kaffirs.
('6', 259, 1, 3, 475057) Most of the Asiatics in this territory are Indians who have entered lawfully and secured their rights in a similar fashion.
('6', 259, 1, 4, 475181) There are also those who have entered by breaking the law.
('6', 259, 1, 5, 475240) Let them be punished for that.
('6', 259, 1, 6, 475271) (Applause.) But the lawful immigrants are entitled to justice as well as to recognition, and they should get them.
('6', 259, 1, 7, 475386) They should not be deprived of rights lawfully acquired.
('6', 259, 1, 8, 475443) It is therefore necessary to maintain a complete register of the lawful immigrants.
('6', 259, 1, 9, 475527) Moreover registration is necessary not only to protect the interests of those who are here by virtue of their legal right, but also to prevent the immigration of those who may in future be prohibited.
('6', 259, 1, 10, 475728) With this end in view a law was passed by the Legislative Council, but it failed to receive the assent of the Imperial Government, as the Indian community raised unreasonable objections to it.
('6', 259, 1, 11, 475921) This is quite understandable for the Imperial Government has a great responsibility in relation to India.
('6', 259, 1, 12, 476027) As long, therefore, as the reins of power in this Colony are in the hands of the Imperial Government, it is clear that they will not assent to such an act.
('6', 259, 2, 13, 476183) PASS LAW AGAIN
('6', 259, 3, 14, 476198) But we can [now] pass a law similar to the previous one.
('6', 259, 3, 15, 476255) I am sure the Imperial Government will give their consent to a similar bill passed by a self governing colony.
('6', 259, 4, 16, 476366) OTHER ACTS
('6', 259, 5, 17, 476377) Some may ask what should be done about Indian immigration in the future.
('6', 259, 5, 18, 476450) The English traders in this Colony hold that the Indians, who have a different way of life and who enter into unfair competition with them, should be prohibited from entering and trading in the Transvaal.
('6', 259, 5, 19, 476655) They are afraid that they will be ruined by the immigration of such men.
('6', 259, 5, 20, 476728) I sympathize with this line of thinking.
('6', 259, 5, 21, 476769) Hence I believe that the parliament of this Colony should, as early as possible, enact a measure to restrict Indian immigration.
('6', 259, 5, 22, 476898) The model for such a law is to be had in the Cape or Natal.
('6', 259, 6, 23, 476958) ARE NOT CAPE AND NATAL LAWS ENOUGH?
('6', 259, 7, 24, 476994) I have given much thought to this question; and I think
('6', 260, 0, 1, 477050) VOL. 6: 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 261
('6', 260, 1, 2, 477093) that, if we adopt the laws of the Cape Colony and Natal, the immigration of ordinary coolies will discontinue, but the immigration of those whom you really wish to keep out, namely, the traders, will not stop.
('6', 260, 1, 3, 477303) If, therefore, we adopt the Cape or the Natal Act, we shall have to add to it the further provision that the immigrant Asiatic cannot carry on trade.
('6', 260, 2, 4, 477453) SIR RICHARDS REMEDY
('6', 260, 3, 5, 477473) I wish to speak frankly on this question.
('6', 260, 3, 6, 477515) Personally I would prefer it that Indians were not allowed to come into the Colony at all.
('6', 260, 3, 7, 477606) A concession may be made in favour of only those coming on a short visit.
('6', 260, 3, 8, 477680) It is much better not to allow any Indians to come in rather than allow them in and then to suppress them, leading to a clash between the local and the Imperial Governments.
('6', 260, 3, 9, 477854) I am therefore of the view that we should pass an act similar to the one in force in the Orange River Colony.
('6', 260, 3, 10, 477964) It was enacted before the Boer War and the Imperial Government did not oppose it.
('6', 260, 3, 11, 478046) In passing the measure we should provide for the continued stay of lawful immigrants and the protection of the rights acquired by them.
('6', 260, 4, 12, 478182) JOHANNESBURG CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
('6', 260, 5, 13, 478215) The Johannesburg Chamber has issued a statement giving the causes of the starvation now prevalent in Johannesburg.
('6', 260, 5, 14, 478330) Competition from the Indian trader is mentioned as one of them.
('6', 260, 5, 15, 478394) In his speech 1 a few months ago, Mr. Quinn had shown that it was no use blaming the Indian trader.
('6', 260, 5, 16, 478494) But the Chambers sole business at present is to rouse public opinion against Indians as much as possible.
('6', 260, 6, 17, 478600) INDIANS GOING TO DELAGOA BAY
('6', 260, 7, 18, 478629) News having been received of the ill treatment of Indians going from the Transvaal to Delagoa Bay, an inquiry was made of the Portuguese Consul.
('6', 260, 7, 19, 478774) In his reply he says that no further disability has been imposed; that, if any regulations were framed recently, they have not been published in the Gazette, and that an Indian going from the Transvaal has no difficulty.
('6', 260, 7, 20, 478995) The hardship brought to our notice was that Indians from the Transvaal were detained at the border if they did

('6', 261, 2, 4, 479477) EAST INDIA ASSOCIATION
('6', 261, 3, 5, 479500) The Transvaal Leader today publishes a cable from England reporting the annual meeting of the East India Association presided over by Sir Raymond West.
('6', 261, 3, 6, 479652) A speaker at the meeting pointed out that Indians suffered no hardships in places like Jamaica, because the whites there belonged to good families and were respectable people.
('6', 261, 3, 7, 479828) In those places a considerable income could be earned by good, capable Indians, free from any bad habits.
('6', 261, 3, 8, 479934) Commenting on this, Sir Raymond West said that there could be no comparison between Jamaica and South Africa, for the whites in South Africa were hostile to the Indians because they suffered from Indian competition.
('6', 261, 3, 9, 480150) Sir Raymond concluded by saying that one of the remedies for Indian hardships in South Africa was that every Indian should receive adequate education.
('6', 261, 3, 10, 480301) Sir Raymond means to suggest that, if we are educated, the displeasure of the whites may lessen, for in that case we should be copying their way of life.

('6', 261, 7, 14, 480519) CHAPTER V: MORALITY AS A RELIGION
('6', 261, 8, 15, 480553) The subject of this chapter may strike one as strange.
('6', 261, 8, 16, 480608) The common idea is that morality and religion are distinct things; still this chapter seeks to consider morality as a religion.
('6', 261, 8, 17, 480736) Some readers may think the writer guilty of confusion.
('6', 261, 8, 18, 480791) That reproach may come from two sides from those who regard religion as more than morality, and from others who think that, where there is morality, there is no need for religion.
('6', 261, 8, 19, 480971) Yet the authors intention is to show their close relationship.
('6', 261, 8, 20, 481034) The societies spreading ethical religion or religious ethics believe in religion through morality.
('6', 261, 8, 21, 481133) The common idea, it may be admitted, is that there may be morality without religion and religion without morality.
('6', 261, 8, 22, 481248) One comes across many men of immoral conduct who claim to be religious in
('6', 262, 0, 1, 481322) VOL. 6: 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 263
('6', 262, 1, 2, 481365) spite of the sinful acts they commit.
('6', 262, 1, 3, 481403) On the other hand, there are moral men like the late Mr. Bradlaugh, who are proud to call themselves atheists and would run away from the name of religion.
('6', 262, 1, 4, 481559) Those who hold either of these views are mistaken.
('6', 262, 1, 5, 481610) Those who hold the first view are not only mistaken, but also dangerous as they practise immorality under the guise of religion.
('6', 262, 1, 6, 481739) In this chapter, there fore, we shall show that, considered intellectually and scientifically, religion and morality are united and should be so united.
('6', 262, 1, 7, 481892) Morality was in the beginning simply the customary conduct of a community, settled ways of acting that men living together naturally fell into.
('6', 262, 1, 8, 482036) By a natural process the good customs tended to survive and the bad ones to die out, since, if the bad ones did not die out, they would weaken the community and lead to its extinction.
('6', 262, 1, 9, 482221) Even today we see this process at work.
('6', 262, 1, 10, 482261) It is neither morality nor religion if people observe good customs more or less unthinkingly.
('6', 262, 1, 11, 482355) However, most of what passes for morality in the world today consists, as pointed out above, of good customs.
('6', 262, 1, 12, 482465) Moreover, men often have a merely superficial idea of religion.
('6', 262, 1, 13, 482529) Sometimes men believe in religion only as a means to ward off dangers that threaten them.
('6', 262, 1, 14, 482619) It would be a mistake to dignify actions as religious where they are performed out of a love that springs from fear.
('6', 262, 1, 15, 482736) But at long last a time does come when men begin to tread the path of morality consciously, deliberately with a determined will, regardless of gain or loss, of life or death, without turning to look back, ready to sacrifice themselves.
('6', 262, 1, 16, 482972) Then can they be said to have been permeated with true morality.
('6', 262, 1, 17, 483037) How can such morality subsist except with the support of religion?
('6', 262, 1, 18, 483104) One tells oneself, If by doing a little harm to another, I can secure my personal interest, why should I not do that little harm? The profit derived from doing harm is no profit, but a positive loss [to the doer].
('6', 262, 1, 19, 483318) How shall this unpalatable dose go down ones throat?
('6', 262, 1, 20, 483371) Ostensibly in Germanys interest, Bismarck perpetrated dreadful deeds.
('6', 262, 1, 21, 483441) Where then was his education?
('6', 262, 1, 22, 483471) Where did those maxims of morality disappear which, at other times, he used to mouth before school children?
('6', 262, 1, 23, 483580) Obviously, a reply to all these questions can be given.
('6', 262, 1, 24, 483636) The reason why he could not keep up his morality in the face of these difficulties was that his morality was not grounded in religion.
('6', 262, 1, 25, 483771) So long as the seed of morality is not watered by religion, it cannot
('6', 263, 0, 1, 483841) 264 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 263, 1, 2, 483883) sprout.
('6', 263, 1, 3, 483891) Without water it withers and ultimately perishes.
('6', 263, 1, 4, 483941) Thus it will be seen that true or ideal morality ought to include true religion.
('6', 263, 1, 5, 484022) To put the same thought differently, morality cannot be observed without religion.
('6', 263, 1, 6, 484105) That is to say, morality should be observed as a religion.
('6', 263, 1, 7, 484164) Furthermore, it is seen that the rules of morality, laid down in the worlds great religions, are largely the same.
('6', 263, 1, 8, 484279) The founders of thereligions have also explained that morality is the basis of religion.
('6', 263, 1, 9, 484368) If a foundation is removed, the superstructure falls to the ground; similarly if morality is destroyed, religion which is built on it comes crashing down.
('6', 263, 1, 10, 484523) The author adds that there is nothing wrong in calling morality a religion.
('6', 263, 1, 11, 484599) Dr. Coit in his prayer says, I shall have no other God except righteousness. On reflection, we shall realize that God will not help us and answer our impassioned prayer for help, if we utter His name, while having a dagger concealed under our arm.
('6', 263, 1, 12, 484847) Let us take two men, one who believes in the existence of God, yet breaks all His Commandments; and another who, though not acknowledging God by name, worships Him through his deeds and obeys His laws, recognizing in the divine laws, their Maker.
('6', 263, 1, 13, 485094) Which of the two men shall we call a man of religion and morality?
('6', 263, 1, 14, 485161) Without a moments thought, one would emphatically reply that the second man alone is to be considered religious and moral.

('6', 264, 9, 22, 486768) Mr. Adamji comes of a noble family.
('6', 264, 9, 23, 486804) His ancestors carried on a business in brocades and many varieties of cloth.

('6', 265, 1, 3, 487555) The problem then arose of who was to take his place.
('6', 265, 1, 4, 487608) But thanks to his knowledge of English and his tact and competence, Mr. Adamji was unanimously appointed Acting Secretary.
('6', 265, 1, 5, 487731) At this time Mr. Abdul Karim Haji Amod Zaveri was the President.
('6', 265, 1, 6, 487796) Within six months of their assumption of office the funds of the Congress rose from 100 to 1100. The members also in those days were full of enthusiasm.
('6', 265, 1, 7, 487949) They used to travel long distances in their own carriages to collect funds.
('6', 265, 1, 8, 488025) And the whole community now enjoys the fruits of the work they did at that time.
('6', 265, 1, 9, 488106) Most of the credit for this work goes to Mr. Adamji; no society can progress unless its secretary is alert and has drive.
('6', 265, 1, 10, 488228) But it was in December of 1896 and January of 1897 that Adamjis tact and ability were clearly seen.
('6', 265, 1, 11, 488328) At that time the passengers from s.s.
('6', 265, 1, 12, 488366) Courland and s.s.
('6', 265, 1, 13, 488384) Naderi had a difficult time in landing at Durban.
('6', 265, 1, 14, 488434) 1 The whites were opposed to their landing and were determined at all costs to prevent it.
('6', 265, 1, 15, 488525) The occasion called for great self restraint, a quick judgement and patience.
('6', 265, 1, 16, 488603) Mr. Adamji showed all these virtues.
('6', 265, 1, 17, 488640) He worked day and night, at the cost of his own business, to ward off the looming misery.
('6', 265, 1, 18, 488730) It was at this time that the late Mr. Nazar came to South Africa and rendered valuable help.
('6', 265, 1, 19, 488823) However, if Mr. Adamji had not shown that grit and tenacity, the happy ending could never have come about.
('6', 265, 1, 20, 488930) From the time of the above crisis until the present day, Mr. Adamji has always done public work to the best of his capacity and has given the benefit of his experience to Mr. Omar Haji Amod Zaveri and Mr. Mahomed Cassim Anglia who are now Joint Secretaries.
('6', 265, 1, 21, 489188) We pray to God that Mr. Adamji may realize his wishes in his native land and return in good health for public work here; and we wish that other leading Indian citizens will follow Mr. Adamjis example.

('6', 266, 4, 5, 489641) DARWINS VIEWS ON ETHICS
('6', 266, 5, 6, 489665) Before summarizing this chapter, it is necessary to give an account first of Darwin himself.
('6', 266, 5, 7, 489758) Darwin was a great Englishman of the last century who made great scientific discoveries.
('6', 266, 5, 8, 489847) His memory andhis power of observation were amazing.
('6', 266, 5, 9, 489900) He has written some books which deserve to be read and pondered.
('6', 266, 5, 10, 489965) With a mass of evidence and arguments, he has shown how man came into being; how he has evolved from a particular kind of monkey.
('6', 266, 5, 11, 490095) After a large number of experiments and much sifting of evidence, he realized that there was not much difference between the anatomy of man and that of the ape.
('6', 266, 5, 12, 490256) Whether this conclusion is correct or not has not much to do with ethics.
('6', 266, 5, 13, 490330) Besides this, Darwin has also shown how ideas of morality affect mankind.
('6', 266, 5, 14, 490404) And as many scholars have faith in Darwins writings, our author has dealt with his views in Chapter VI.
('6', 266, 6, 15, 490508) CHAPTER VI
('6', 266, 7, 16, 490519) It is noble voluntarily to do what is good and right.
('6', 266, 7, 17, 490573) The true sign of mans nobility is the fact that, instead of being driven about like a cloud before the wind, he stands firm and can do, and in fact does, what he deems proper.
('6', 266, 7, 18, 490749) Nevertheless, we ought to know the direction in which our environment disposes our instincts.
('6', 266, 7, 19, 490843) We know that we are not in every way masters of our own life; there are conditions outside of us to which we have to adjust ourselves.
('6', 266, 7, 20, 490978) For instance, in a country where Himalayan cold prevails, we have to put on adequate clothing, whether we like it or not, in order to keep the body warm.
('6', 266, 7, 21, 491132) That is, we have to act with prudence.
('6', 266, 7, 22, 491171) The question now arises: does the influence of environment lead us to be moral?
('6', 266, 7, 23, 491251) Or can it be that the forces that surround us are indifferent to morality?
('6', 266, 7, 24, 491326) At this point it becomes necessary to consider Darwins views.
('6', 266, 7, 25, 491388) Though Darwin did not write as a moral philosopher, he has shown
('6', 266, 8, 26, 491453) 1 Vide the following item.
('6', 267, 0, 1, 491480) 268 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 267, 1, 2, 491522) how close the connection is between morality and environment.
('6', 267, 1, 3, 491584) Those who think that morality is unimportant and that physical strength and mental capacity are the only things that matter should read Darwin.
('6', 267, 1, 4, 491728) According to him, there is an instinct of self preservation in men as in other creatures.
('6', 267, 1, 5, 491818) He also says that those who survive the struggle for existence may be regarded as successful, that is, those who are unfit tend to extinction, but that the issue of the struggle does not depend on mere physical force.
('6', 267, 1, 6, 492036) Comparing man with the bear or the buffalo, we find that, in physical strength, the bear and the buffalo are superior to him; in a tussle he will surely be worsted.
('6', 267, 1, 7, 492201) Nonetheless he is their superior by virtue of his intelligence.
('6', 267, 1, 8, 492265) Similarly we can compare different races of men.
('6', 267, 1, 9, 492314) In war it is not the side with the largest numbers or with the hardiest soldiers that wins, but the side with the ablest generals and the best strategy, though its soldiers may be fewer or less hardy.
('6', 267, 1, 10, 492515) In these examples we see the superiority of intelligence.
('6', 267, 1, 11, 492573) But Darwin shows further that moral strength is even superior to physical and intellectual strength; and we can see in various ways thata man who has moral qualities lasts longer than one who is devoid of them.
('6', 267, 1, 12, 492784) Some hold that Darwin taught that strength is enough; that is, those who are physically strong ultimately survive.
('6', 267, 1, 13, 492899) Superficial thinkers may believe that morality is of no use.
('6', 267, 1, 14, 492960) But this is not Darwins view at all.
('6', 267, 1, 15, 492997) We find from the evidence of the early history of man that races without morality have completely disappeared.
('6', 267, 1, 16, 493108) The people of Sodom and Gomorrah were extremely immoral and they are now therefore completely extinct.
('6', 267, 1, 17, 493211) We can see even today how races without morality are steadily declining.
('6', 267, 1, 18, 493284) Let us now take some simple illustrations and see how at least common morality is necessary for sustaining the human race.
('6', 267, 1, 19, 493407) A peaceful disposition is one element of morality.
('6', 267, 1, 20, 493458) At first sight it may appear that people with a violent disposition rise in life; but a little reflection will show that, when the sword of violence falls, it may be on ones own neck.
('6', 267, 1, 21, 493642) Freedom from bad habits forms another element of morality.
('6', 267, 1, 22, 493701) Statistics have proved that, at the age of thirty, intemperate persons in England are not likely to live beyond another thirteen or fourteen years, while the teetotallers expectation of life is seventy years.
('6', 267, 1, 23, 493910) Yet another element of morality is chastity.
('6', 267, 1, 24, 493955) Darwin has shown that profligate persons die early.
('6', 267, 1, 25, 494007) They have no children, or if they have any, they are weak.
('6', 267, 1, 26, 494066) The profligate become feeble of mind, and
('6', 268, 0, 1, 494108) VOL. 6: 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 269
('6', 268, 1, 2, 494151) in course of time look like idiots.
('6', 268, 1, 3, 494187) If we consider the morals of various communities, we find the same state of affairs.
('6', 268, 1, 4, 494272) Among the Andaman islanders the husband looks after his wife only until their child is weaned and begins to move about, and he then abandons her.
('6', 268, 1, 5, 494418) That is, they do not have the quality of altruism, and utter selfishness prevails.
('6', 268, 1, 6, 494501) The result is that the race is gradually dying out.
('6', 268, 1, 7, 494553) Darwin shows that the altruistic instinct is present, to some extent, even in animals: timid birds display strength in defending their young.
('6', 268, 1, 8, 494695) This shows that, if there had been no selflessness among animals, we should have in the world scarcely any life other than grass and poisonous flora.
('6', 268, 1, 9, 494845) The main distinction between man and other animals is that man is more selfless than the animals.
('6', 268, 1, 10, 494943) He has sacrificed his life for others in proportion to his strength, that is, for his offspring, for his family, his community and his country.
('6', 268, 1, 11, 495087) Darwin clearly shows that moral strength is supreme.
('6', 268, 1, 12, 495140) The ancient Greeks had greater intelligence than the Europeans of today, but when the former gave up morality, their intelligence became their enemy, and no trace of them remains today.
('6', 268, 1, 13, 495326) Nations are sustained neither by wealth nor by armies, but by righteousness alone.
('6', 268, 1, 14, 495409) It is the duty of man to bear this truth in mind and practise altruism, which is the highest form of morality.

('6', 268, 6, 19, 495625) CHHAGANLAL,
('6', 268, 7, 20, 495637) I post to you today, with the necessary clarification, the papers you had sent me for my comments.
('6', 268, 7, 21, 495736) I also send some Gujarati material, which has to be printed in this very issue.
('6', 268, 7, 22, 495816) What I have written about Adamji Sheth 1 may appear some time later if he is not leaving just yet.
('6', 268, 7, 23, 495915) I have suggested presenting him with an address.
('6', 268, 7, 24, 495964) If one is presented to him by the Congress, I expect to get a separate report of

('6', 269, 0, 1, 496079) 270 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 269, 2, 2, 496121) It is good that the speeches of the Congress session have appeared in the Gujarati columns of the current issue.
('6', 269, 2, 3, 496234) The biographi cal sketch of the Amir ought not to have been postponed so long.
('6', 269, 2, 4, 496313) I have not yet been able to get an Urdu poem for Ethical Religion.
('6', 269, 2, 5, 496380) If you come across any there, do insert it.
('6', 269, 2, 6, 496424) I had hoped to get some Urdu poem today.
('6', 269, 2, 7, 496465) If you dont find any, let the thing go without it, but do not insert any that applies to the Hindus alone.
('6', 269, 2, 8, 496572) There is one song by Pritamdas in Kavyadohan beginning with the line, O man, without caring to know the supreme ideal, you have hankered after your selfish ends only.
('6', 269, 2, 9, 496739) You may use it if you approve of it.
('6', 269, 2, 10, 496776) If you can get Kabirs bhajans, they will be quite unexceptionable.
('6', 269, 2, 11, 496843) I hope to have a letter about Kalyandas and about other matters tomorrow.
('6', 269, 2, 12, 496917) Blessings from MOHANDAS [PS.] Letters about the power of attorney and registration were despatched yesterday.

('6', 269, 5, 15, 497125) JOHANNESBURG, February 6, 1907
('6', 269, 7, 16, 497156) THE TOWN CLERK P. O. BOX 1047 JOHANNESBURG
('6', 269, 9, 17, 497199) The Committee of the British Indian Association has seen the draft of the by laws for licensing and regulating Asiatic tea rooms or eating houses.
('6', 269, 9, 18, 497346) My Committee respectfully submits the following for
('6', 269, 10, 19, 497398) 1 This address was presented on February 6, 1907 and the function reported in Indian Opinion, 9 2 1907.
('6', 270, 0, 1, 497502) VOL. 6: 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 271
('6', 270, 1, 2, 497545) the Councils consideration, in connection with the by laws.
('6', 270, 1, 3, 497605) It appears that the necessity for the by laws has arisen on account of the large, indentured Chinese population and the catering for that population which has been undertaken by various persons.
('6', 270, 1, 4, 497800) But, under the definition of the term, Asiatic tea room or eating house is evidently included any place where Asiatics are catered for, and it would, therefore, include the small British Indian restaurants which are conducted in Johannesburg.
('6', 270, 1, 5, 498043) They are very few, and have very few visitors, the British Indian population being all permanently resident, and not requiring any houses for feeding it.
('6', 270, 1, 6, 498197) My Committee, therefore, ventures to suggest that the definition should not include those of British Indians.
('6', 270, 1, 7, 498307) At the same time, my Committee has no desire to protect the few small British Indian restaurants in Johannesburg from inspection with regard to sanitation, etc., but, in the humble opinion of my Committee, the ordinary public health by laws are sufficient for the purpose.
('6', 270, 1, 8, 498580) In the humble opinion of my Committee, the procedure laid down for making application for a tea room or an eating house licence is cumbersome and costly, and could only be justified if there were large remunerative establishments.
('6', 270, 1, 9, 498811) The fee fixed for the annual licence, too, in my Committees humble opinion, is almost prohibitive, and is greater than the fee charged for either European restaurants or Kaffir eating houses, the fee for the former being 7.10.0 only and for the latter 5. Moreover, the definition of an Asiatic eating house includes a tea room.
('6', 270, 1, 10, 499139) Therefore, whilst a general tea room carries with it a licence of 3, an Asiatic tea room will require a licence fee of 10; and the fee of 2 for transfer of licences is, in my Committees humble opinion, a heavy charge.
('6', 270, 1, 11, 499357) My Committee, therefore, ventures to trust that the Town Council will be pleased to favourably consider the objections herein raised to the proposed by laws.
('6', 270, 2, 12, 499515) I have the honour to be,
('6', 270, 4, 13, 499540) Your obedient servant,

('6', 271, 2, 3, 499713) [JOHANNESBURG,] February 7, 1907
('6', 271, 3, 4, 499746) CHHAGANLAL,
('6', 271, 4, 5, 499758) Your letter reached me on the 4th.
('6', 271, 4, 6, 499793) We are going to get the money for the advertisement of the Mahomedan estate.
('6', 271, 4, 7, 499870) Please send the bill.
('6', 271, 4, 8, 499892) I have received the bills sent by you.
('6', 271, 4, 9, 499931) I shall now see how much can be realized.
('6', 271, 4, 10, 499973) I did understand your suggestion about the riddles.
('6', 271, 4, 11, 500025) I do not think it proper to introduce the riddles feature so long as we are not in a position to have it regularly and offer prizes ourselves.
('6', 271, 4, 12, 500168) What can be the object of the man who wants to spend money on this?
('6', 271, 4, 13, 500236) How long can he be expected to do so?
('6', 271, 4, 14, 500274) Moreover, we can hardly expect many to take part in the competition.
('6', 271, 4, 15, 500343) However, you may inquire of your correspondent if he intends paying for the prizes indefinitely.
('6', 271, 4, 16, 500440) It would be very strange indeed if he wanted to do so.
('6', 271, 4, 17, 500495) On the other hand, it would not be proper for us to start this feature if he agrees to give prizes once in a while.
('6', 271, 4, 18, 500611) You may, however, write to me if you have more to say.
('6', 271, 4, 19, 500666) I follow what you say about Sanghavi.
('6', 271, 4, 20, 500704) Mr. B. P. Ibrahim has not asked us to discontinue the advertisement.
('6', 271, 4, 21, 500773) I shall ask him about it when he comes.
('6', 271, 4, 22, 500813) I shall see about the customers whose names you have sent me.
('6', 271, 4, 23, 500875) I am still trying to make arrangements for the Hamidia [Society] I know that Manilal is weak in his arithmetic.
('6', 271, 4, 24, 500987) Please give him adequate attention.
('6', 271, 4, 25, 501023) How much English has the new man studied?
('6', 271, 4, 26, 501065) Who is he?
('6', 271, 4, 27, 501076) Is he the son of an indentured labourer?
('6', 271, 4, 28, 501117) I shall be able to credit the money payable to Hirji Valji.
('6', 271, 4, 29, 501177) Regarding the Anti Indian Law Fund bill, Hemchand says it was paid in cash here.
('6', 271, 4, 30, 501258) As the post will not reach me on Saturday evening, you need not bother about sending me proofs here.
('6', 271, 4, 31, 501359) It will be enough if you let me know in your letter of Thursday what subjects have already been dealt with.
('6', 271, 4, 32, 501467) It will enable me to know what topics I need not write about.
('6', 271, 4, 33, 501529) About your going to England, I think it is desirable, if you can
('6', 272, 0, 1, 501594) VOL. 6: 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 273
('6', 272, 1, 2, 501637) go immediately.
('6', 272, 1, 3, 501653) But your going depends mainly on your work there.
('6', 272, 1, 4, 501703) (I) When can you be conveniently free?
('6', 272, 2, 5, 501742) (2) Who will take care of your work in your absence?
('6', 272, 3, 6, 501795) (3) Will Harilal be able to look after the Gujarati columns?
('6', 272, 4, 7, 501856) I think the proper time for you to leave for England is when you can get away from the Press.
('6', 272, 4, 8, 501950) When you think you can do so conveniently, you will first have to discuss it with all your colleagues and then write to me.
('6', 272, 4, 9, 502074) That Kalyandas is leaving seems to me a calamity.
('6', 272, 4, 10, 502124) I think you should as far as possible avoid going to town.
('6', 272, 4, 11, 502183) Maganlal may go if he has the courage to undertake the work in town.
('6', 272, 4, 12, 502252) Harilal should look after the Gujarati work and Maganlal should look after the accounts, that is, the original entries should be made by him.
('6', 272, 4, 13, 502394) If, however, Maganlal cannot cope with the two jobs, and if West cannot do it, then I think your going will have to be put off for the present.
('6', 272, 4, 14, 502538) You will then be able to leave only after I go there, that is, in the beginning of next year.
('6', 272, 4, 15, 502632) I may be able to go there towards the end of this year.
('6', 272, 4, 16, 502688) But if I do not, I can go there only in March next year; and your going will be postponed till then.
('6', 272, 4, 17, 502789) I am thinking of sending for Kalyandass brother [from India].
('6', 272, 4, 18, 502851) Perhaps Goko 1 too might come.
('6', 272, 4, 19, 502882) But all this is uncertain.
('6', 272, 4, 20, 502909) You have to consider whether or not you can leave, if Kalyandas is not there and no extra hand has been recruited.
('6', 272, 4, 21, 503024) Think all this over and let me know.
('6', 272, 4, 22, 503061) It would be better, I think, if you talked things over with West and wrote to me.
('6', 272, 4, 23, 503143) What does he feel about it?
('6', 272, 4, 24, 503171) If your visit to England Materializes, you will be unable to go to India.
('6', 272, 4, 25, 503245) You may think of going to India on your way back.
('6', 272, 4, 26, 503295) What you do must depend mainly on your choice.
('6', 272, 4, 27, 503342) Though Harilal has agreed to stay, I find some uncertainty in what he writes.
('6', 272, 4, 28, 503420) Therefore, I wrote to you to treat him in such a manner as to have a steadying influence on his mind.
('6', 272, 4, 29, 503522) The poster is found useful here.
('6', 272, 4, 30, 503555) It may prove useful there too if we can arrange to send a man regularly to town.
('6', 272, 4, 31, 503636) Do not think any more of discontinuing it.
('6', 272, 4, 32, 503679) Try to make the best use of the posters now that they have been printed.
('6', 272, 4, 33, 503752) It is worth trying if Sanghavi, Omar Sheth and others exhibit the posters and also stock copies of Indian Opinion for sale.
('6', 272, 4, 34, 503876) Ask Adams also.
('6', 272, 4, 35, 503892) Some people in Maritzburg also might well

('6', 273, 0, 1, 503945) 274 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 273, 1, 2, 503987) stock these things.
('6', 273, 1, 3, 504007) But all this requires time.
('6', 273, 1, 4, 504035) It is absolutely necessary to fix a particular amount per month so that nobody draws more.
('6', 273, 1, 5, 504126) The better course would be to inform me every month how much each one has drawn, so that I can write to those who have [over]drawn.
('6', 273, 1, 6, 504258) Or you may discuss the matter with Anandlal.
('6', 273, 1, 7, 504303) I feel the balance sheet should now be made ready without delay.
('6', 273, 1, 8, 504368) If Kalyandas can leave in April, please assign Maganlal mainly to this job and get it done by that time.
('6', 273, 1, 9, 504473) Please see what I have written to West yesterday about Sam Sardars son who wants to stay there.
('6', 273, 2, 10, 504569) Blessings from MOHANDAS [PS.]
('6', 273, 3, 11, 504599) In the printed list for Johannesburg which you sent, Mr. Allys name is crossed.
('6', 273, 3, 12, 504679) Please find out and let me know.

('6', 273, 6, 16, 504975) We publish today in another section an article on the South Africa British Indian Committee.
('6', 273, 6, 17, 505068) The article shows that the Committee is working hard and will be able to do really effective work, if it receives help from South Africa.
('6', 273, 6, 18, 505206) The main thing that we can do is to support it through agitation.
('6', 273, 6, 19, 505272) The Grand Old Man of India too has given the same advice.
('6', 273, 6, 20, 505330) It is not enough that we feel the pain; our cry must be loud enough to communicate that pain.
('6', 273, 6, 21, 505424) Even as a mother, as the saying goes, does not serve [food] unasked, we must know that, unless we agitate at this end, nothing will happen and we shall not be able to avail ourselves of all the help that the Committee can give.
('6', 273, 6, 22, 505652) Our position would deteriorate if, having brought the Committee into existence, we failed to support it.
('6', 273, 6, 23, 505757) For those who help us do so on the [implicit] understanding that we deserve the help.
('6', 273, 6, 24, 505843) We must support

('6', 274, 1, 2, 505902) the Committee by providing the funds.
('6', 274, 1, 3, 505940) We cannot make up the deficit for this year unless we send them the 300 we promised.
('6', 274, 1, 4, 506025) We should continue to finance the Committee until a solution is found for our problems.
('6', 274, 1, 5, 506113) The Committee has to deal with the four following problems: (1) the Natal Municipal Bill; (2) the Natal Licensing Act; (3) the hardships of [Indians in the] Transvaal; and (4) the forthcoming Colonial Conference.
('6', 274, 1, 6, 506326) The Colonial Conference is scheduled to meet on April 15, and the Committee will have to busy itself about it with all its energy.
('6', 274, 1, 7, 506457) As for the other three problems, we have to send them the necessary information.
('6', 274, 1, 8, 506538) Regarding the two Natal Acts, we feel that we should hold a [protest] meeting and send cables to Lord Elgin and also inform the Committee.
('6', 274, 1, 9, 506677) It must be borne in mind that such an opportunity, once lost, will never come again.

('6', 274, 5, 13, 506824) The appeal against the rejection of the Tongaat licence was heard on January 31. A special report of this is given in our English section.
('6', 274, 5, 14, 506963) It will be seen that, by and large, the Licensing Board has done no injustice.
('6', 274, 5, 15, 507042) Those whose houses or shops have been certified fit by the doctors are given licences; and orders have been passed that licences be given to persons whose account books are fairly well kept.
('6', 274, 5, 16, 507233) The result of this appeal provides full confirmation of the warning we had issued.
('6', 274, 5, 17, 507316) If we keep our shops and houses clean and maintain our accounts in an irreproachable manner, there will be no fear of our losing the licences.
('6', 274, 5, 18, 507459) Nobody should be able to point the finger at us.
('6', 274, 5, 19, 507508) It is not enough that our houses are ordinarily well kept; they should be so clean that no other houses can compare with them.
('6', 274, 5, 20, 507635) We believe that Dr. Hill gave favourable evidence out of compassion.
('6', 274, 5, 21, 507704) But we must not depend upon such pity.
('6', 274, 5, 22, 507743) Nobody should assume that, because we are saved this year, we shall be saved next year also.
('6', 274, 5, 23, 507836) Our houses, our shops and our books ought to be in proper condition, ready for inspection at any time.
('6', 274, 5, 24, 507939) If they are, there will be little likelihood of difficulty in obtaining licences.

('6', 275, 5, 6, 508245) We have written a great deal of the fresh troubles that have come upon the Indian traders in Natal.
('6', 275, 5, 7, 508345) 1 Yet we cannot think too much about what we are to do in that matter.
('6', 275, 5, 8, 508416) Writing in The Times of Natal, one Mr. F. A. Baker says that he once saw a Kaffir painting the front of an Indian shop and goes on to make the following comments: I do not know whether the common man notices this sort of thing.
('6', 275, 5, 9, 508644) If he did, he would never argue that Indian traders should not be driven out forcibly.
('6', 275, 5, 10, 508731) However much we [Whites] patronize Indian traders, they will never patronize a White.
('6', 275, 5, 11, 508817) They never drop a coin into the pocket of a White, unless forced to do so.
('6', 275, 5, 12, 508892) I have seen [White] Government servants, workers and others, entering Indian shops.
('6', 275, 5, 13, 508976) But have these traders ever given them any work?
('6', 275, 5, 14, 509025) Even when an Indian trader knows of a starving White, he never helps him.
('6', 275, 5, 15, 509099) Why should we show pity to such Indians?
('6', 275, 5, 16, 509140) If our members of parliament do not pass an Act to drive out these Indians, we must replace them by others who will carry out our wishes.
('6', 275, 6, 17, 509278) From these views expressed by a White we have a lesson to learn: We must encourage the Whites too.
('6', 275, 6, 18, 509377) It is a short sighted policy to employ, through sheer niggardliness, a Kaffir for washing work.
('6', 275, 6, 19, 509473) If we keep in view the conditions in this country and patronize the Whites, whenever proper and necessary, then every such White will serve as an advertisement for the Indian trader.
('6', 275, 6, 20, 509656) We do certain things to flatter or please the White merchants; if, instead of doing so, or over and above that, we helped a White, not in order to humour him but for doing him a good turn, that will yield us better results.
('6', 275, 6, 21, 509880) We believe that to help a needy White is much better in every way than to feed a serpent like Mr. Tatham with milk and be bitten later.

('6', 276, 5, 7, 510473) The Middelburg Town Council has served a notice on the Indians in the Location in that town to vacate it within three months.
('6', 276, 5, 8, 510599) Those who have built houses have been asked to shift them from the site !
('6', 276, 5, 9, 510673) This would mean that Indians who have lived there for a long time would have to remove the structures and leave without compensation.
('6', 276, 5, 10, 510807) The Indians in the Location have addressed the British Indian Association on the subject, and an enquiry is being made.

('6', 276, 9, 14, 510993) FOR INDIANS GOING TO DELAGOA BAY
('6', 276, 10, 15, 511026) I wrote last week about Indians going to Delagoa Bay.
('6', 276, 10, 16, 511080) 1 Mr. Manga who has arrived here from Delagoa Bay met the Portuguese Consul.
('6', 276, 10, 17, 511157) The Consul has agreed to permit Indians who make an affidavit before him to proceed to Delagoa Bay.
('6', 276, 10, 18, 511257) To a communication addressed to him, he has sent the following reply: With reference to your letter dated the 22nd, I have to state that there are no restrictions on foreigners visiting Delagoa Bay.
('6', 276, 10, 19, 511456) But those intending to stay in Delagoa Bay have to obtain a permit to do so.
('6', 276, 10, 20, 511533) If they propose to stay for less than twenty days, they have to intimate to the municipality their addresses and the purpose of the visit.
('6', 276, 10, 21, 511672) A statement to this effect may be made before me also.
('6', 276, 10, 22, 511727) Those who do not make such a statement are liable to be penalised; but three days grace is usually given for the observance of these regulations.

('6', 277, 2, 3, 512107) ELECTION CAMPAIGN
('6', 277, 3, 4, 512125) The election campaign is on.
('6', 277, 3, 5, 512154) The rival candidates are spending a lot of money to get themselves elected.
('6', 277, 3, 6, 512230) They have written letters to the electors asking for their votes.
('6', 277, 3, 7, 512296) Sir Richard Solomon is going all out in his efforts at Pretoria.
('6', 277, 3, 8, 512361) The result will be known by the 22nd of this month.
('6', 277, 3, 9, 512413) The Star has called him the National Scout.
('6', 277, 4, 10, 512457) PORTER In his recent report to the Johannesburg Town Council 1 on health and sanitation in the city, Dr. Porter has criticized the Indians as follows.
('6', 277, 5, 11, 512608) SMALLPOX Writing about smallpox, Dr. Porter says: The greatest obstruction is caused by Asiatics and Somalis.
('6', 277, 5, 12, 512718) The Asiatics resist anyone entering their houses [for purposes of inspection or treatment].
('6', 277, 5, 13, 512810) They obstruct the isolation of patients and measures to prevent infection.
('6', 277, 5, 14, 512885) Whenever a medical examination is attempted, they send the patients into the toilet.
('6', 277, 5, 15, 512970) It was only after a leading person was fined for an attempt to hide a case of suspected smallpox that they came to their senses.
('6', 277, 5, 16, 513099) Later such cases came to the knowledge of the authorities without much difficulty, thanks to Mr. Lloyd.
('6', 277, 5, 17, 513203) A great deal of help was forthcoming from the leaders of the Indian community at the time of the plague.2
('6', 277, 6, 18, 513309) MALAY LOCATION There was a population of 4,200 in November 1905 in the Malay Location.
('6', 277, 6, 19, 513396) Of this number 1,600 were Indians, 970 Malays, 70 Chinese and Japanese, 100 Somalis, etc., 40 Kaffirs, 1,300 Cape Boys and 120 Whites.
('6', 277, 6, 20, 513531) Reporting on the Location in January 1906, Dr. Stock pointed out that, as there was a possibility of well water being contaminated through percolation, it was necessary to drain the slop water [on the surface].

('6', 278, 1, 2, 513941) out among the Indians because they concealed their patients.
('6', 278, 1, 3, 514002) The Chief Medical Officer suggested at first that it would be better if all poor Indians, waiters and the like, were removed from the town to the distant Bazaars.
('6', 278, 1, 4, 514165) There were no doubt difficulties in doing this, but as the Klipspruit Location had come up, arrangements could be made for Indians to go there.
('6', 278, 1, 5, 514309) As many Indians did business with the Kaffirs, it was hoped that they would go to Klipspruit.
('6', 278, 1, 6, 514403) This, in substance, is Dr. Porters report.
('6', 278, 1, 7, 514446) It contains other important observations besides.
('6', 278, 1, 8, 514496) But this summary requiresto be pondered over by every Indian.
('6', 278, 1, 9, 514558) The suggestion about shifting to the Location is still here.
('6', 278, 1, 10, 514619) And as long as we continue to conceal our patients and neglect the common rules of sanitation through niggardliness or laziness, the hreat of [removal to] the Locations will always remain.
('6', 278, 1, 11, 514808) ASIATIC EATING HOUSES The regulations governing Asiatic eating houses, framed by the Johannesburg Town Council will come up before the Council in a few days.
('6', 278, 1, 12, 514966) According to them the annual licensing fee will be 10. These regulations are meant primarily for the Chinese, but Indians too are covered by them.
('6', 278, 1, 13, 515113) They will have to bear a great loss because the number of people using Indian eating houses is very small, and they cannot therefore afford to pay the annual fee of 10. The British Indian Association has therefore written to the Council on the matter.
('6', 278, 2, 14, 515365) Other provisions deal with keeping the premises clean and the procedure for obtaining licences.
('6', 278, 3, 15, 515461) TURKEY AND GERMANY
('6', 278, 4, 16, 515480) A cable appearing in The Rand Daily Mail shows that a fresh cause of conflict has arisen between Turkey and Germany.
('6', 278, 4, 17, 515597) As it is not a Reuter cable and may not appear in the newspapers there, I give a translation below:
('6', 278, 5, 18, 515697) It appears that a few days ago Fehim Pasha, the chief of the secret police, detained a German ship carrying a cargo of timber.
('6', 278, 5, 19, 515824) The reason for this was that its German owners did not offer bribes to the subordinate officers.
('6', 278, 5, 20, 515921) The German Ambassador was informed of the Pashas action and he sent a protest to the Port [authorities].He further declared that, if the

('6', 279, 1, 2, 516138) Pasha did not forthwith hand back the ship, it will be recovered with the help of the German Army for the rights of the German people were inviolable.
('6', 279, 1, 3, 516289) This warning had the desired effect and the chief of the secret police immediately informed the German company that the ship had been released.
('6', 279, 1, 4, 516433) Now the Ambassador has written a letter to the Port saying that Fehim Pasha is corrupt, is a free booter and a notorious thief.
('6', 279, 1, 5, 516561) Besides casting a slur on the good name of His Majesty the Sultan, he has belittled the Ottoman Government in the eyes of foreigners.
('6', 279, 1, 6, 516695) The Ambassador further demands that Fehim Pasha should be deprived of his position according to law and should be deported or imprisoned for life.

('6', 279, 5, 10, 516919) The meeting of Indian leaders with the editor of The Natal Advertiser has yielded good results.
('6', 279, 5, 11, 517015) The Natal Advertiser has written at length pointing out the fancied contradictions between our writings, the work done by Messrs Gandhi and Ally and the facts as stated by the leaders of the Indian community.
('6', 279, 5, 12, 517224) It has further pointed out that even men like Sir Lepel Griffin are prepared to grant all rights to Indians and to allow any number of them to emigrate to South Africa.
('6', 279, 5, 13, 517393) It is obvious that all this writing is of no value whatever.
('6', 279, 5, 14, 517454) But instead of acknowledging its defeat, The Advertiser has tried to keep up the facade.
('6', 279, 5, 15, 517543) Leaving aside The Advertiser article under review, it is easy to see that the paper holds the view that big traders should have no difficulties, that problems arising from the Immigration Act should be solved and a just attitude adopted towards the Indian community.
('6', 279, 5, 16, 517810) If The Advertiser continues this policy, both the newspapers of Durban will, it may reasonably be expected, be somewhat friendly to the Indian community and not attack it outright.
('6', 279, 5, 17, 517991) Much good can result if a similar arrangement can be arrived at with the Maritzburg papers also.
('6', 279, 6, 18, 518088) 1 A deputation of leading Durban Indians met the editor of The Natal Advertiser following a critical editorial by the paper on the Imperial Government's reaction to the British Indian Deputation.
('6', 279, 6, 19, 518284) This was, however, followed by a more conciliatory article addressed to Indians and entitled A True Agitation and a False, which said, Let us, at all events, understand one another.
('6', 280, 0, 1, 518466) VOL. 6: 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 281
('6', 280, 1, 2, 518509) However, we must not assume that nothing remains to be done after what has appeared in The Advertiser.
('6', 280, 1, 3, 518612) Admittedly, we shall have less to contend with if the newspapers do not write against us.
('6', 280, 1, 4, 518702) But we have many other enemies like the Press to win over.
('6', 280, 1, 5, 518761) The whites are not the ones to give up the struggle.
('6', 280, 1, 6, 518814) For instance, Mr. Arthur Wade has started inciting the Kaffirs; he has appealed to them not to have any dealings with Indian traders.
('6', 280, 1, 7, 518948) It is true that one or two speeches of this kind will not have much effect.
('6', 280, 1, 8, 519024) But this speech should be a warning to us to be on the alert.
('6', 280, 1, 9, 519086) [From Gujarati] Indian Opinion, 16 2 1907
('6', 280, 2, 10, 519128) 258. NATAL LICENSING LAW
('6', 280, 3, 11, 519153) During the hearing of an appeal about a licence before the Maritzburg Town Council, a member of the Council said that they ought to hesitate before refusing a licence to an Indian who is a British subject.
('6', 280, 3, 12, 519359) Moreover, the local chamber [of commerce] has passed a resolution to the effect that an Indian should have no difficulty in obtaining a licence if he could prove that he was a British subject.
('6', 280, 3, 13, 519552) In the four licence cases that were tried in Verulam the charges were that the shops were dirty, that access to the houses was only through the shops or that the shops were also used as dining rooms.
('6', 280, 3, 14, 519752) In Potchefstroom, licences were refused on the score of colour alone.
('6', 280, 3, 15, 519822) All the appeals from Ladysmith and the neighbouring places have been dismissed on the ground that the traders do not know how to keep accounts, that they do not know English at all and that they depend wholly on low paid employees in these matters.
('6', 280, 3, 16, 520071) The court refused even to record the evidence of the book keepers.
('6', 280, 3, 17, 520138) All this goes to show conclusively that the whi tes are ben t on dri ving us out of thi s cou ntry.

('6', 281, 2, 3, 520995) In this issue we publish a letter 1 concerning licences from Grahams town in the Cape Colony.
('6', 281, 2, 4, 521089) This leads one to suspect that a large number of poor hawkers is unable to carry on business for want of licences.
('6', 281, 2, 5, 521204) Such licences are a source of income to many Indians.
('6', 281, 2, 6, 521258) We have read the Cape Act and, as far as we know, the Town Councils are bound to issue licences.
('6', 281, 2, 7, 521355) Legal action therefore can be taken in this matter.
('6', 281, 2, 8, 521407) The same difficulties are met with in Natal.
('6', 281, 2, 9, 521452) The Act itself is very rigorous, but because of the strenuous efforts of Congress officials much harm has been, and will be, prevented.
('6', 281, 2, 10, 521588) The Congress Secretaries go about from place to place, encouraging the people to take the necessary measures.
('6', 281, 2, 11, 521698) The Cape League and the [British Indian] Association should follow this example.
('6', 281, 2, 12, 521779) It is the duty of these two bodies to enquire into the conditions prevailing in every town.
('6', 281, 2, 13, 521871) If they make sufficient effort, we believe, redress can be had.
('6', 281, 2, 14, 521935) It must also be remembered that Natal does not offer the advantages that the Cape does for putting up a fight.
('6', 281, 2, 15, 522046) It will, therefore, be a matter of shame if the Indian leaders in the Cape do not offer resistance.
('6', 281, 2, 16, 522146) We are prepared to publish the names and addresses of all those who have not been able to obtain licences in the Cape, and we request all our readers to send us the same.

('6', 281, 4, 18, 522359) 1 This letter was from a hawker who sought the intervention of the editor of Indian Opinion; he had held a hawkers licence for several years, which the authorities refused to renew and he was therefore faced with the prospect of starvation.

('6', 282, 1, 2, 522644) 260. ETHICAL RELIGIONVII
('6', 282, 2, 3, 522669) CHAPTER VII: SOCIAL IDEAL
('6', 282, 3, 4, 522695) t is sometimes said that all morality involves social relations.
('6', 282, 4, 5, 522760) This is well said; for instance, if the judge has a proper sense of justice, men who go to court obtain satisfaction.
('6', 282, 4, 6, 522878) Similarly love, kindness, generosity and other qualities can be manifested only in relation to others.
('6', 282, 4, 7, 522981) The force of loyalty can be demonstrated only in our relations with one another.
('6', 282, 4, 8, 523062) Of patriotism, nothing need be said.
('6', 282, 4, 9, 523099) Truly speaking, there is no aspect of morality the benefit of which accrues to the practitioner alone.
('6', 282, 4, 10, 523202) Sometimes it is said that truthfulness and other virtues have nothing to do with the other person and are entirely personal.
('6', 282, 4, 11, 523327) But we must admit that by telling the truth we prevent harm to another, just as by telling a lie and deceiving a person we do him an injury.
('6', 282, 5, 12, 523468) In the same way, when a man disapproves of certain laws or
('6', 282, 6, 13, 523527) customs and withdraws from society, even then his acts affect society.
('6', 282, 6, 14, 523598) Such a man lives in a world of ideals.
('6', 282, 6, 15, 523637) He does not worry that the world of his ideals is not yet born.
('6', 282, 6, 16, 523701) For him the mere thought that the prevailing standard is not good enough is sufficient to impel him to resist it.
('6', 282, 6, 17, 523815) He will constantly try to change other peoples way of life to his own.
('6', 282, 6, 18, 523886) This is how prophets have caused the worlds wheels to change their course.
('6', 282, 7, 19, 523961) So long as man remains selfish and does not care for the hap 
('6', 282, 8, 20, 524023) piness of others, he is no better than an animal and perhaps worse.
('6', 282, 8, 21, 524091) His superiority to the animal is seen only when we find him caring for his family.
('6', 282, 8, 22, 524174) He is still more human, that is, much higher than the animal, when he extends his concept of the family to include his country or community as well.
('6', 282, 8, 23, 524323) He climbs still higher in the scale when he comes to regard the human race as his family.
('6', 282, 8, 24, 524413) A man is an animal or imperfect [as a human being] to the extent that he falls behind in his service to humanity.
('6', 282, 8, 25, 524527) If I feel my wifes injury or that of my community, yet have no sympathy for anyone outside the circle, it is clear that I do not have any feeling for humanity as such; but I have, simply out of selfishness or a sense of discrimination, a certain feeling for my wife, my children or the community which I hold as my own.
('6', 282, 9, 26, 524847) That is to say, we have neither practised nor known ethical
('6', 282, 10, 27, 524907) religion so long as we do not feel sympathy for every human being.
('6', 282, 10, 28, 524974) Now we know that the higher morality must be comprehensive; it must embrace all men.
('6', 282, 10, 29, 525059) Considering our relation to mankind, every man has a claim over us, as it is our duty always to serve him.
('6', 282, 10, 30, 525166) We should act on
('6', 283, 0, 1, 525183) 284 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 283, 1, 2, 525225) the assumption that we have no claim on others.
('6', 283, 1, 3, 525273) He is merely ignorant who would here argue that the man acting in this manner will be trampled in the worlds scramble.
('6', 283, 1, 4, 525392) For it is a universal experience that God always saves the man who whole heartedly devotes himself to the service of others.
('6', 283, 1, 5, 525517) According to this moral standard all men are equal.
('6', 283, 1, 6, 525569) This is not to be interpreted to mean equality of position and function for all.
('6', 283, 1, 7, 525650) It only means that, if I hold a high place, I also have the ability to shoulder its duties and responsibilities.
('6', 283, 1, 8, 525763) I should not therefore lose my head and believe that men with smaller responsibilities are my inferiors.
('6', 283, 1, 9, 525868) Equality depends on the state of our mind, and until our mind reaches that state, we shall remain backward.
('6', 283, 1, 10, 525976) According to this moral standard no nation can rule another for selfish ends.
('6', 283, 1, 11, 526054) It is immoral of the American people to reduce the aborigines to an inferior status and run the government.
('6', 283, 1, 12, 526162) A civilized race coming into contact with a savage one owes it to the latter to raise it to its own level.
('6', 283, 1, 13, 526269) The same standard rules that the king is the servant and not the master of his people and that the officers are not there to enjoy power but to make the people happy.
('6', 283, 1, 14, 526436) If the people in a democratic state are selfish, that state comes to no good.
('6', 283, 1, 15, 526514) Moreover, according to this law, the stronger members of a state or community have to protect, not oppress, the weaker ones.
('6', 283, 1, 16, 526639) Under such a government there can be no starvation; nor can there be excessive accumulation of riches; for we can never be happy while we see our neighbours languishing in misery.
('6', 283, 1, 17, 526819) The man following this high moral standard will never amass wealth.
('6', 283, 1, 18, 526887) He who would be moral need not be scared away by the thought that few follow this ideal morality; for he is master of his morality, not of its results.
('6', 283, 1, 19, 527039) He will be considered guilty if he does not practise morality; but nobody will find fault with him if his immoral behaviour has no consequences for society.

('6', 283, 3, 22, 527263) NEW PARLIAMENT There has been a great deal of hustle over the new parliament of the Transvaal, which is to have 58 members, 38 of whom will represent the Johannesburg area.
('6', 283, 3, 23, 527436) The nominations of candidates were filed on Saturday, the 9th.
('6', 283, 3, 24, 527499) This issue of Indian Opinion will be in the hands of readers by the 16th or the 18th.
('6', 283, 3, 25, 527585) The election will take place on
('6', 284, 0, 1, 527617) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 285
('6', 284, 1, 2, 527661) Wednesday, the 20th.
('6', 284, 1, 3, 527682) The names of successful candidates will be known on the 21st.
('6', 284, 1, 4, 527744) It is therefore hoped that these names will be available to our readers in the next issue.
('6', 284, 1, 5, 527835) THE PARTIES In all there are five parties: Progressive (i.e.
('6', 284, 1, 6, 527896) mine owners), Hetvolk, (i.e., the Dutch), Nationalist, Independent, and Labour.
('6', 284, 1, 7, 527976) Only two of these are parties in the real sense.
('6', 284, 1, 8, 528025) The Nationalist Party, it may be said, has been formed for those who might be scared by the names, Progressive and Hetvolk.
('6', 284, 1, 9, 528149) It is widely believed that the Hetvolk and Nationalist Parties will fare well and that, between them, they will secure a majority of the seats.
('6', 284, 1, 10, 528293) Many look upon the Progressive Party with disfavour.
('6', 284, 1, 11, 528346) The leaders of the Hetvolks are General Botha and General Smuts, those of the Nationalists Sir Richard Solomon and Mr. Wyburg and of the Progressives Sir Percy Fitzpatrick, Sir George Farrar, Mr. Hosken, etc.
('6', 284, 1, 12, 528555) and others.
('6', 284, 1, 13, 528567) The real tussle that is going on is between Sir Richard Solomon and Sir Percy Fitzpatrick.
('6', 284, 1, 14, 528658) They are both candidates from Pretoria.
('6', 284, 1, 15, 528698) It is difficult to say which of the two will win.
('6', 284, 1, 16, 528748) Sir Richards views about the Chinese and theKaffirs havingundergone a change, he is being looked upon by many with scorn.
('6', 284, 1, 17, 528870) He was ready to bring the Chinese into the Colony, but now says that his views in the matter have changed.
('6', 284, 1, 18, 528977) Formerly, he used to say that the Kaffirs should get their legitimate rights; now he would approve whatever the other members propose to do about them.
('6', 284, 1, 19, 529129) An analysis shows that there are 35 Hetvolk, 29 Progressive, 32 Independent, 15 Nationalist and 12 Labour candidates.
('6', 284, 1, 20, 529247) Five of the Hetvolk candidates have already been elected unopposed.
('6', 284, 1, 21, 529315) The Indian community, it appears, stands neither to lose nor to gain whichever party comes to power, for members of both the parties have already expressed themselves against the Indians.
('6', 284, 1, 22, 529503) PERMIT OFFICE An article has been published in The Transvaal Advertiser which clearly appears to have been inspired by the Permit Office.
('6', 284, 1, 23, 529641) It says that the Indian community causes the Permit Office much trouble, that the failure of the Ordinance to receive assent has increased the work of that office, that Indians enter without permits from hundreds of places, that they bring in their children without permits and employ them in the stores, and that the decisions of the Supreme Court have moreover created numerous obstacles in the working of the existing law.
('6', 284, 1, 24, 530067) The Advertiser has thus tried to incite the people so as to ensure in advance that the new parliament passes the Ordinance again.
('6', 285, 0, 1, 530197) 286 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 285, 1, 2, 530239) The statements are obviously false.
('6', 285, 1, 3, 530275) Instead of the Permit Office being put to trouble, it is that office which gives trouble.
('6', 285, 1, 4, 530365) The hardships caused by the law are increasing instead of decreasing; and the Supreme Court steps in only when the Permit Office transgresses all limits.
('6', 285, 1, 5, 530519) It is not enough that we know all this.
('6', 285, 1, 6, 530559) Knowing this, we ought to adopt remedies for these ills.
('6', 285, 1, 7, 530616) The measures that need to be taken have already been indicated in Indian Opinion.
('6', 285, 1, 8, 530698) But the greatest, the ultimate, remedy is going to gaol; and so long as that is not forg otten, no harm can befall [us].
('6', 285, 1, 9, 530819) The adoption of this remedy will also require a good deal of money.
('6', 285, 1, 10, 530887) The British Indian Association and all other bodies should take quick and effective measures in this regard.
('6', 285, 1, 11, 530996) MIDDELBURG LOCATION News has now been received from Middelburg about the Location there.
('6', 285, 1, 12, 531085) Acting on it, the Association has written to the Town Clerk asking him why the notices have been issued.
('6', 285, 1, 13, 531190) Further action in the matter will be taken after a reply has been received.
('6', 285, 1, 14, 531266) COOVADIAS CASE Mr. Coovadia, a well known merchant of Johannesburg, who is the Treasurer of the British Indian Association, was on his way to Johannesburg with his 16 year old son.
('6', 285, 1, 15, 531447) The boy was forced to detrain at Volksrust because he did not have a permit.
('6', 285, 1, 16, 531524) Earlier when a permit was applied for, it was refused, and Captain Fowle had given the assurance that there would be no difficulty at all.
('6', 285, 1, 17, 531663) Though Mr. Coovadia had this letter with him, the boy was nevertheless asked to detrain.Medical evidence indicated that the boy was eighteen years old, whereupon the Magistrate refused to release him.
('6', 285, 1, 18, 531864) A written representation was made to Mr. Chamney who declined to intervene.
('6', 285, 1, 19, 531940) Last Monday, the case came up for hearing at Volksrust, when the Magistrate refused to send it up to Johannes burg for recording evidence.
('6', 285, 1, 20, 532079) It will now therefore be heard next Monday.
('6', 285, 1, 21, 532123) In the end, of course, the boy will be let off.
('6', 285, 1, 22, 532171) But think of the trouble and expense Mr. Coovadia will have to go through before obtaining justice in such a trifling matter!
('6', 285, 1, 23, 532297) When a permit was applied for, it was said that it could not be issuedas the boy was under sixteen.
('6', 285, 1, 24, 532397) 1 And for want of a permit one has to undergo all this expense.
('6', 285, 1, 25, 532461) When a well known man has to suffer these hardships, what about the poor?
('6', 285, 2, 26, 532535) 1 The original reads: If a permit had been applied for, it would have been said that it could not be given as the boy was under sixteen years. Gandhiji, however, mentions earlier that a perrnit was in fact refused.

('6', 286, 1, 2, 532794) REGULATIONS FOR ASIATIC EATING HOUSES The British Indian Association has sent a representation 1 against these Regulations to the Town Council.
('6', 286, 1, 3, 532938) It states that the licence fee for an eating house should not be as high as 10 and that there was no need for applying these stringent rules to the Indian community as it was small in number.
('6', 286, 1, 4, 533130) HEGGER Dr. Hegger has come here in connection with the election campaign.
('6', 286, 1, 5, 533204) In a speech he made on Sunday he said that an Indian voter had offered him a large sum, which he had refused.
('6', 286, 1, 6, 533314) Obviously this is quite untrue.
('6', 286, 1, 7, 533346) We may hope to hear more of the matter.
('6', 286, 1, 8, 533386) Mr. Macintyre, who heard this falsehood, has sent a report in English for Indian Opinion.
('6', 286, 1, 9, 533476) RAINS This time there has been abundant rainfall in Johannesburg as indeed in the whole of the Transvaal.
('6', 286, 1, 10, 533582) For three days it has been raining continuously.
('6', 286, 1, 11, 533631) Great damage has been caused at Standerton by the heavy rain.

('6', 287, 2, 3, 534696) This question is suggested by some cablegrams received from England last week.
('6', 287, 2, 4, 534775) While English women do manly deeds, shall we, though men, behave like women?
('6', 287, 2, 5, 534852) This is no matter for fun, but a grave one indeed.
('6', 287, 2, 6, 534903) Let us see how.
('6', 287, 2, 7, 534919) The women of England have no franchise.
('6', 287, 2, 8, 534959) They are fighting for it without minding peoples ridicule.
('6', 287, 2, 9, 535018) A few days ago a procession of eight hundred women marched to the Houses of Parliament.
('6', 287, 2, 10, 535106) then the police stopped the crowd, some brave women tried to force their way into the House.
('6', 287, 2, 11, 535199) These women do not belong to the working class.
('6', 287, 2, 12, 535247) One of them is a sister of General French 1, and over Sixty years old.
('6', 287, 2, 13, 535318) Another, Miss Pankhurst, is the daughter of a well known wealthy Englishman.
('6', 287, 2, 14, 535395) Both are women of learning.
('6', 287, 2, 15, 535423) There were many such women in this crowd of eight hundred.
('6', 287, 2, 16, 535482) Of those who forced their way in, prominent ladies like General Frenchs sister were arrested andprosecuted.
('6', 287, 2, 17, 535590) The Magistrate sentenced them to fines ranging from 1 to 2, or to imprisonment for varying periods.
('6', 287, 2, 18, 535690) Such sentences have been passed on 49 women, and each one of them, instead of paying up the pittance of a fine, has courted imprisonment.
('6', 287, 2, 19, 535828) The aged sister of General French is also among them.
('6', 287, 2, 20, 535882) We believe these women have behaved in a manly way.
('6', 287, 2, 21, 535934) Now let us look at our own house.
('6', 287, 2, 22, 535968) Lord Selborne and Sir Richard Solomon say that the Asiatic Ordinance should be [re ]enacted.
('6', 287, 2, 23, 536061) Perhaps that will be done in a month or two.
('6', 287, 2, 24, 536106) Will Indians go to gaol if that happens?
('6', 287, 2, 25, 536147) We think men cry for fear of imprisonment when they are caught while using a false permit, but not while committing the offence.
('6', 287, 2, 26, 536276) This we regard as unmanly.
('6', 287, 2, 27, 536303) Now when people are wrongfully treated as criminals and asked to give their finger prints, will they quietly give them or will they go to gaol?
('6', 287, 2, 28, 536447) If they give their finger prints and suffer dishonour, we shall regard them as doubly unmanly.
('6', 287, 2, 29, 536542) Hence we ask: will Indian men be effeminate?
('6', 287, 2, 30, 536587) Or will they emulate the manliness shown by English women and.
('6', 287, 2, 31, 536650) wake up?
('6', 287, 2, 32, 536659) Will they choose to find happiness in prison taking it to be a palace, or will they submit to oppression when the Transvaal Government starts it?
('6', 287, 2, 33, 536805) In a few days our mettle will be tested.

('6', 288, 2, 3, 537114) To return to the subject of the Ladysmith licences, we should examine how much of the blame lies with us.
('6', 288, 2, 4, 537220) We have repeatedly written on this matter in our English columns.
('6', 288, 2, 5, 537286) A question has been asked in the House of Commons on the subject at the instance of the [South Africa British Indian] Committee, but it would be better if we made a search nearer home.
('6', 288, 2, 6, 537471) It came out in the course of the judgement on the appeal that the account books had been written up newly or only occasionally and were got written by a man for an annual fee of 8. The Natal Witness has severely criticized these practices and approved the action of the Ladysmith Board.
('6', 288, 2, 7, 537758) We must think over all this.
('6', 288, 2, 8, 537787) It is essential to maintain regular accounts.
('6', 288, 2, 9, 537833) It is unnecessary for every trader to employ a separate accountant; what is necessary is that the accounts must be written up regularly so that no one can say a word against them.
('6', 288, 2, 10, 538013) It is also possible to have the accounts written by an English accountant or through a lawyer, where a competent Indian accountant is not available.
('6', 288, 2, 11, 538162) We shall never succeed unless we give up some of our stingy ways.

('6', 288, 5, 15, 538453) The main difference is that, while formerly all Indians anywhere in South Africa were allowed to enter the Cape, now only the old Indian residents will be allowed in.
('6', 288, 5, 16, 538620) There are other changes besides.
('6', 288, 5, 17, 538653) We believe that the remissness of the Cape Indian leaders is partly responsible for these changes.
('6', 288, 5, 18, 538752) It was quite likely that, even if there had been a strenuous struggle, the Indians would have lost the case, but then we would at least have done our duty.
('6', 288, 5, 19, 538908) Again, for a struggle, the Cape offers advantages not found elsewhere.
('6', 288, 5, 20, 538979) But the Cape Indians do not avail themselves of these advantages.

('6', 289, 2, 3, 539155) We have reliable information that the resolution of the Licensing Board of Ladysmith has alarmed many members of the Durban Chamber of Commerce.
('6', 289, 2, 4, 539300) In a private meeting of members, many expressed the opinion that the Licensing Act should be repealed.
('6', 289, 2, 5, 539403) In the end they appointed Messrs Handuz and Butcher to inquire into the matter.

('6', 289, 6, 15, 540172) He says that the term uncivilized should not be defined so as to include sons of indentured labourers.
('6', 289, 6, 16, 540275) Moreover he says that it is not legitimate to include Indians among Coloured persons, for all sorts of people are covered by the term.
('6', 289, 6, 17, 540410) The Indian Government feels strongly in the matter and insists that the Indian community should be granted relief.
('6', 289, 6, 18, 540525) Lord Elgin therefore hopes that the Natal Government will consider the point.
('6', 289, 6, 19, 540603) In this controversy, it is probable that we shall win, if we do our duty.
('6', 289, 6, 20, 540677) The Natal Municipal Council has replied that the Bill should remain unchanged.

('6', 290, 2, 3, 540951) FIVE PERMIT CASES
('6', 290, 3, 4, 540969) The case of Mr. Coovadias son was heard by the Magistrate of Volksrust on Friday the 15th.
('6', 290, 3, 5, 541060) 1 Mr. Gandhi appeared for Mr. Coovadia.
('6', 290, 3, 6, 541100) Giving Evidence, Constable MacGregor stated that boys under fourteen were allowed to enter without a permit, that permits were demanded of boys of fourteen and over, and that if they failed to produce them, they were arrested.
('6', 290, 4, 7, 541327) Mr. James Codie deposed that one could not say that Captain Fowles decisions were always acceptable to the present Registrar.
('6', 290, 4, 8, 541453) On being shown Captain Fowles letter about Mr. Coovadias son, he stated that the letter could not be treated as a permit and Mr. Chamney would not consider it as binding.
('6', 290, 4, 9, 541624) On being severely cross examined, he admitted that Mr. Chamney should accept every thing that had been done by Captain Fowle as Permit Officer.
('6', 290, 4, 10, 541768) Mr. Amod Saleji Coovadia 2 giving evidence about his nephews age said that he was a student at Johannesburg in 1903. Mr. Coovadia corroborated this testimony.
('6', 290, 4, 11, 541927) Dr. Hick gave evidence about the boys age, and Mrs Gandhi produced Captain Fowles letters that were with him.
('6', 290, 4, 12, 542037) The boy himself gave evidence to show that he had some knowledge of English.
('6', 290, 4, 13, 542114) Here the hearing [of the evidence] was over.
('6', 290, 4, 14, 542159) The Magistrate then heard the arguments on both sides and acquitted the boy.
('6', 290, 5, 15, 542236) After this the cases of four Indians were heard.
('6', 290, 5, 16, 542285) They were alleged to have entered with other peoples permits.
('6', 290, 5, 17, 542347) Their names were Kika Parsad, Naga Bhana, Ambu Vallabh Soni and Mirzakhan.
('6', 290, 5, 18, 542422) Three of them admitted that they had bought permits from others in Bombay on payment of Rs. 90 for each.
('6', 290, 5, 19, 542527) The fourth man pleaded not guilty.
('6', 290, 5, 20, 542562) All the four were sentenced to a fine of 40 or four months imprisonment.
('6', 290, 6, 21, 542635) Mr. Coovadias case shows that persons with genuine case sometimes obtain justice, after spending a lot of money.
('6', 290, 6, 22, 542748) This is so mainly because of the false cases that are taken to the courts.
('6', 290, 6, 23, 542823) It can be

('6', 291, 1, 3, 543087) Those buying such permits lose their livelihood, are needlessly ruined and cannot live in the Transvaal.
('6', 291, 1, 4, 543192) By such deeds they do harm to the whole community and are responsible for the enactment of rigorous laws.
('6', 291, 2, 5, 543298) ASIATIC BLUE BOOK
('6', 291, 3, 6, 543316) Lord Elgin has published in England the complete history of the Asiatic Ordinance.
('6', 291, 3, 7, 543399) Long cables about it have been received by all the three newspapers here.
('6', 291, 3, 8, 543473) Among these, Lord Selbornes statement, in particular, deserves to be noted by the Indian community.
('6', 291, 3, 9, 543573) He severely criticizes Lord Elgins decision.
('6', 291, 3, 10, 543618) He says that, in granting the Indian plea, Lord Elgin has broken [Lord Selbornes] promise which he had made at Potchefstroom about not allowing fresh Indian immigrants till responsible government had been set up.
('6', 291, 3, 11, 543831) This complaint of His Excellency is unjustified.
('6', 291, 3, 12, 543880) For, the immigration of new Indians apart, even old residents have difficulty in re entering the Colony and, if they succeed at all, it is after many months.
('6', 291, 3, 13, 544038) He says further that many Indians continue to enter without permits.
('6', 291, 3, 14, 544107) Even this statement should be regarded as improper, as the Indian community has repeatedly suggested to Lord Selborne the appointment of an inquiry commission to substantiate this.
('6', 291, 3, 15, 544288) Lord Seibornes bitter remarks only show one thing: the Indian community has to put up a fight not merely against the Whites, but also against the Governor himself who, instead of remaining impartial, has turned against the Indians.
('6', 291, 4, 16, 544520) NEW MEMBERS OF LEGISLATURE
('6', 291, 5, 17, 544547) Lord Selborne has nominated 15 members to the legislature, of whom 11 are Progressives and four belong to the Hetvolk.
('6', 291, 5, 18, 544666) They are: Mr. H. Crawford, Mr. L. Curtis, Col W. Daerymple, Mr. G. J. W. Du Toit, Mr. R. Feelpam, Mr. W. Grant, Mr. Max Langermann, Mr. W. A. Martin, Mr. T. A. R.

('6', 292, 2, 3, 545062) CHAPTER VIII: PERSONAL MORALITY
('6', 292, 3, 4, 545094) I am responsible for this, or This is my duty: this is a moving and wonderful thought.
('6', 292, 3, 5, 545181) A mysterious, resounding voice seems to say, To thee, individually, O man, is given this task.
('6', 292, 3, 6, 545276) Whether defeat or victory, both belong to thee.
('6', 292, 3, 7, 545324) Thou art what no one else in the world is, for nowhere has nature created two similar objects.
('6', 292, 3, 8, 545419) Thou hast a duty which no one else in the world can do, and if thou dost not do it that loss will stand debited to thee in the worlds balance sheet. What is that duty I owe to myself? Someone may quote the verse:
('6', 292, 4, 9, 545632) Call not man God, for man is not God,
('6', 292, 5, 10, 545670) Yet man is not distinct from Gods glory,
('6', 292, 6, 11, 545711) And answer, My duty is to rest secure in the belief that I am a ray of Gods light. Another may answer that the duty is to have sympathy and fraternal regard for others.
('6', 292, 6, 12, 545880) A third may answer that it is to revere parents, care for ones wife and children, and acquit oneself well with brother, sister or friend.
('6', 292, 6, 13, 546018) Alongside of all these virtues, it is also a part of my duty to respect myself even as I respect others.
('6', 292, 6, 14, 546123) As long as I do not understand myself, how shall I understand others?
('6', 292, 6, 15, 546193) And how shall I respect one whom I do not know?
('6', 292, 6, 16, 546241) Many hold the view that the obligation of proper conduct arises [only] in relation to others and that, in the absence of contact with others, one may do just as one pleases.
('6', 292, 6, 17, 546415) He who holds this view does not know what he says.
('6', 292, 6, 18, 546466) In this world none can, with impunity, act as he pleases.
('6', 292, 6, 19, 546524) Let us now see what our duty is to ourselves.
('6', 292, 6, 20, 546570) Let us take, first, our private habits which are unknown to all but ourselves.
('6', 292, 6, 21, 546649) We are responsible for them since they affect our character; but this is not all.
('6', 292, 6, 22, 546731) We are responsible for them also because they affect others.
('6', 292, 6, 23, 546792) Every person ought to control his own impulses, and keep his soul as well as body clean.
('6', 292, 6, 24, 546881) Tell me, says a great man, what a mans private habits are and I shall tell you what he is or will be.
('6', 292, 6, 25, 546983) We should therefore control all our appetites, so that we do not drink or eat to excess.
('6', 292, 6, 26, 547072) Else we shall lose our strength and our good name.
('6', 292, 6, 27, 547123) Worldly success never comes to him who does not abstain from sensual pleasures and does
('6', 293, 0, 1, 547211) 294 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 293, 1, 2, 547253) not thus save his body, mind, intellect and soul.
('6', 293, 1, 3, 547303) Arguing along these lines and keeping ones instincts pure, one should further consider how to put them to use.
('6', 293, 1, 4, 547414) One ought to have a fixed aim in life.
('6', 293, 1, 5, 547453) If we do not discover our lifes purpose, and keep steadily to the course, we shall be swept along like a rudderless ship on the high seas; we shall falter on the [moral] path.
('6', 293, 1, 6, 547629) Mans highest duty in life is to serve mankind and take his share in bettering its condition.
('6', 293, 1, 7, 547722) This is true worshiptrue prayer.
('6', 293, 1, 8, 547755) He is a godly man who does Gods work.
('6', 293, 1, 9, 547793) Hypocrites and cheats going about invoking Gods name are legion.
('6', 293, 1, 10, 547858) Because a parrot utters the name of God, no one would call it godly.
('6', 293, 1, 11, 547927) Contribution to an ideal order of human life is something everyone can aim at.
('6', 293, 1, 12, 548006) With this aim in view the mother may legitima tely rear her child, the lawyer may pursue his profession, the merchant may carry on his business or trade and the working man may labour.
('6', 293, 1, 13, 548191) A person with that fixed aim would never deviate from the path of morality, for if he did, he could not fulfil his aim of uplifting mankind.
('6', 293, 1, 14, 548332) Let us consider the matter in some detail.
('6', 293, 1, 15, 548375) We ought constantly to examine whether our way of life tends to improve human life or to worsen it.
('6', 293, 1, 16, 548475) Thus the merchant should ask himself whether, in transacting a business, he is cheating himself or another.
('6', 293, 1, 17, 548583) The lawyer and the physician, acting according to this standard, will give more thought to their client or patient than to their fees.
('6', 293, 1, 18, 548718) The mother in rearing her child would proceed very cautiously lest she should spoil the child out of misguided love or some selfish interest.
('6', 293, 1, 19, 548860) The worker too would be guided by these considerations and do his duty.
('6', 293, 1, 20, 548932) The result of all this would be that, if the worker fulfils his function in conformity with the moral ideal, he would be deemed better and higher than the wealthy merchant, physician or lawyer who lives without any discipline.
('6', 293, 1, 21, 549159) The worker would be the true coin and those selfish men, even though more intelligent or wealthy, would be counterfeit.
('6', 293, 1, 22, 549279) This further shows that any man, whatever his place in life, has the power to fulfil this aim.
('6', 293, 1, 23, 549374) A mans value depends upon his way of life, not his status.
('6', 293, 1, 24, 549433) Ones way of life is not to be judged by ones visible outward actions, but by ones inner leanings.
('6', 293, 1, 25, 549531) For instance, if of two men, one gives a dollar to a poor person to rid himself of his presence and the other half a dollar but with love and out of compassion for the man, obviously, the one who gave half a dollar is
('6', 294, 0, 1, 549749) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 295
('6', 294, 1, 2, 549793) truly moral, while the other who gave a dollar, the sinner.
('6', 294, 1, 3, 549853) To sum up, he alone is religious, he alone is happy and he alone is wealthy, who is sincere in himself, bears no malice, exploits no one and always acts with a pure mind.
('6', 294, 1, 4, 550024) Such men alone can serve mankind.
('6', 294, 1, 5, 550058) How can a damp matchstick kindle a log of wood?
('6', 294, 1, 6, 550106) How can a man who does rot practise morality teach it to another?
('6', 294, 1, 7, 550172) How can a sinking man save another from drowning?
('6', 294, 1, 8, 550222) The man who lives a moral life never raises the question as to how to serve the world, for he is never in doubt.
('6', 294, 1, 9, 550335) Mathew Arnold says of a friend:
('6', 294, 2, 10, 550367) I saw him sensitive in frame,
('6', 294, 3, 11, 550397) I knew his spirits low,
('6', 294, 4, 12, 550421) And wished him health, success, and fame
('6', 294, 5, 13, 550462) I do not wish it now.
('6', 294, 6, 14, 550484) For these are all their own reward,
('6', 294, 7, 15, 550520) And leave no good behind:
('6', 294, 8, 16, 550546) They try usoftenest make us hard,
('6', 294, 9, 17, 550580) Less modest, pure, and kind.
('6', 294, 10, 18, 550609) Time was when Arnold wished his friend health, success and fame.
('6', 294, 10, 19, 550674) But he did not so wish now, because his friends happiness or misery did not depend on their presence or absence; he therefore only wished that his morality might ever endure.
('6', 294, 10, 20, 550849) Emerson says, Adversity is the prosperity of the great. Both the money and the fame belonging to the base are a misery to them and to the world.

('6', 294, 14, 24, 551081) NOTICE REGARDING PERMITS
('6', 294, 15, 25, 551106) A notice published in the Government Gazette here says that permits, if applied for before March 31, will be issued to Indians who are at present in the Transvaal and can prove that they were there in 1899 and during or just before the war and that they left the Colony

('6', 295, 0, 1, 551442) 296 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 295, 1, 2, 551484) because of the war.
('6', 295, 1, 3, 551504) After that date, those who do not hold a permit will be prosecuted.
('6', 295, 1, 4, 551572) The notice means in effect that those who possess old registers and are at present in the Transvaal, or those who have other documents but not the yellow permit itself, should get one issued by March 31.
('6', 295, 2, 5, 551776) VREDEDORP ORDINANCE
('6', 295, 3, 6, 551796) A member of the South Africa British Indian Committee had tabled a question in the House of Commons about the Vrededorp Ordin ance.
('6', 295, 3, 7, 551928) Mr. Winston Churchill said in reply that correspondence was going on with Lord Selborne regarding the compensation to be paid to Indians.
('6', 295, 3, 8, 552066) This shows that Mr. Ritch has been working for the Committee most energetically; and that its effect is being felt.
('6', 295, 3, 9, 552182) On receipt of this cable, the British Indian Association held a meeting and resolved to have photographs taken of the Vrededorp Location and publish them in a supplement to Indian Opinion and to send a cable [to England].
('6', 295, 3, 10, 552404) In pursuance of this resolution, a long cable 1 has been sent to the Committee saying that Indians own 19,000 worth of propertyland, goods, buildings and outstandingsin that Location and that as many as 75 Indians live in it.
('6', 295, 4, 11, 552630) ASIATIC EATING HOUSES
('6', 295, 5, 12, 552652) A letter on this subject has been received from the Johannesburg Town Council saying that it will certainly not reduce the annual fee that had already been fixed.
('6', 295, 5, 13, 552815) The Association has written again.
('6', 295, 6, 14, 552850) RAILWAY HARDSHIPS
('6', 295, 7, 15, 552868) Letters were addressed to the General Manager of Railways about Mr. Coovadia not being allowed to go to Pretoria by the morning train and about Mr. James, an Indian, who was insulted by the conductor during his journey from Germiston.
('6', 295, 7, 16, 553103) The reply states that an inquiry is being made.
('6', 295, 8, 17, 553151) NEW ELECTION
('6', 295, 9, 18, 553164) Last time I sent 48 names.

('6', 296, 1, 3, 553821) Thus of a total of 69 elected, 21 are Progressive, 35 Hetvolk, seven Nationalist, three Labour Party and three Independent.
('6', 296, 1, 4, 553945) The election campaign has ended with results that nobody had foreseen.
('6', 296, 1, 5, 554016) The Dutch have won a victory leaving all the other parties well behind.
('6', 296, 1, 6, 554088) The most that was hoped for was that the Dutch and the Nationalist Party together might win a majority.
('6', 296, 1, 7, 554192) This means that in political affairs the Dutch have won back what they lost in the war.
('6', 296, 1, 8, 554280) There is great excitement over Sir Richard Solomons defeat at Pretoria.
('6', 296, 1, 9, 554352) Sir Richard will not now be able to assume the office of Prime Minister.
('6', 296, 1, 10, 554425) But it is being said that some elected member will resign his seat and Sir Richard will thus be given an opportunity to enter parliament.
('6', 296, 1, 11, 554563) If this comes about, it seems probable that Sir Richard will become Minister for Justice.
('6', 296, 1, 12, 554653) General Botha is likely to be the Prime Minister.
('6', 296, 1, 13, 554703) That is to say, he will be as good as President.
('6', 296, 1, 14, 554752) This has greatly elated the hearts of the Dutch.
('6', 296, 1, 15, 554801) For us there is not much in this either to rejoice or to regret.
('6', 296, 1, 16, 554866) However, one may hope that the Dutch will do the Indian community some measure of justice.
('6', 296, 1, 17, 554957) Some of them know the Indian community well.
('6', 296, 1, 18, 555002) It does not seem likely that they will be wholly unjust.
('6', 296, 1, 19, 555059) I am writing this on Tuesday, the 26th.
('6', 296, 1, 20, 555099) However, it would be no matter for surprise if the cabinet were to be formed before this issue of Indian Opinion is out.

('6', 296, 6, 25, 555326) MY DEAR CHHAGANLAL,
('6', 296, 7, 26, 555346) I am sending in a separate packet the Hamidia Societys job.
('6', 296, 7, 27, 555406) The book is to be the same size as a printed copy of a report I am
('6', 297, 0, 1, 555473) 298 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 297, 1, 2, 555515) sending you in the same packet.
('6', 297, 1, 3, 555547) In addition to the Gujarati rules and their English translation both of which have already bee sent, you have to print the enclosed Gujarati matter.
('6', 297, 1, 4, 555696) The Gujarati matter now enclosed is also to be rendered in English and printed.
('6', 297, 1, 5, 555776) Will you please let me know the charge for printing 500 copies of the whole job?
('6', 297, 1, 6, 555857) You need not count the cost of translation and let me know also approxi mately how many pages the whole thing will occupy.
('6', 297, 1, 7, 555980) This will be in your hands on Thursday.
('6', 297, 1, 8, 556020) If you can send me a telegram for 1s, you may let me know the charge by telegram, as I am likely to be there next week and I am anxious while I am here to get either the order or its withdrawal.
('6', 297, 1, 9, 556215) I raised the question of cost myself, because it seemed to me that the job was rather bulky, and, if a bill was rendered to them, that might appear to them to be too big, [and] they might feel dissatisfied.
('6', 297, 1, 10, 556422) I thought, therefore, that they should know the true position beforehand.
('6', 297, 1, 11, 556496) I have got the Gujarati proof for the rules which I am sending in the same packet.
('6', 297, 1, 12, 556579) You need not proceed with the printing because everything will depend upon the acceptance of our terms.
('6', 297, 1, 13, 556683) You should keep the Gujarati matter at present with you, for, in the event of the acceptance of our terms, I shall be able to translate it there on my coming.
('6', 297, 1, 14, 556842) I am sending something more for Indian Opinion.
('6', 297, 1, 15, 556890) You have sent me the proof of Messrs Averys order.
('6', 297, 1, 16, 556941) I return it.
('6', 297, 1, 17, 556954) I wonder if you oticed the glaring blunders in the English portion.
('6', 297, 1, 18, 557022) I had to telegraph you.
('6', 297, 2, 19, 557046) Yours sincerely, M. K. GANDHI [Enclosure] [PS] As regards the article by The Colonist which I had asked you to translate, we might add in the Gujarati translation that the ideas expressed in the article are ours.
('6', 297, 2, 20, 557259) It is not necessary to rule the paper for me.
('6', 297, 2, 21, 557305) The moneys for the Madressa that were posted elsewhere are now properly credited.
('6', 297, 2, 22, 557387) These and the ones recently received are included in the settlement.
('6', 297, 2, 23, 557456) Lalbhais was received only yesterday.
('6', 297, 2, 24, 557494) Kalyandas has not sent the customs note.

('6', 298, 2, 3, 557699) This licence appeal case should give us much food for thought.
('6', 298, 2, 4, 557762) Mr. Goga deserves congratulations on his success.
('6', 298, 2, 5, 557812) The Indian community, too, should be pleased.
('6', 298, 2, 6, 557858) In this matter, The Natal Mercury has commented strongly in our favour.
('6', 298, 2, 7, 557930) So too has The Times of Natal.
('6', 298, 2, 8, 557961) The local Government also is helping us.
('6', 298, 2, 9, 558002) But what is the good of all this?
('6', 298, 2, 10, 558036) How much did Mr. Goga have to spend to get his right accepted?
('6', 298, 2, 11, 558099) He had to engage three lawyers, all reputed to be at the top of the profession in Natal.
('6', 298, 2, 12, 558188) 1 He had a very anxious time before he got his licence.
('6', 298, 2, 13, 558244) And then, it was not out of a sense of justice that the Town Council gave it to him; but under pressure.
('6', 298, 2, 14, 558349) For, as soon as the case of Mr. Gogas licence concluded, there came up the case of a poor Indian, Benne by name.
('6', 298, 2, 15, 558462) In his case, too, the objection related to the books of account, but the licence was refused.
('6', 298, 2, 16, 558556) The reason was that Benne could not engage three lawyers and take the matter further.
('6', 298, 2, 17, 558642) And so he is to have no licence.
('6', 298, 2, 18, 558675) It only means that those who are very rich can save their licences.
('6', 298, 2, 19, 558743) 2 But how long can the well to do hold out while the poor are ruined?
('6', 298, 2, 20, 558813) The ate he rich Indians depends upon that of the poor Indian shopkeepers.
('6', 298, 2, 21, 558887) The subject is being discussed throughout the Colony at present.
('6', 298, 2, 22, 558952) The Chamber of Commerce intends to work on our side, so that if we put up a good fight, we shall probably succeed in getting the law changed.
('6', 298, 2, 23, 559094) With this object in view we, as independent observers, have made some suggestions in the English section.
('6', 298, 2, 24, 559200) It is necessary for us to organize resistance throughout the Colony along those lines.
('6', 298, 2, 25, 559287) The Congress is working hard.
('6', 298, 2, 26, 559317) It should exert itself further, establish contacts with the Chambers and approach other Europeans and important members of parliament in order to bring about a solution.

('6', 298, 5, 30, 559594) He was part author of the Dealers' Licenses Act, took notable part in suppresssing the Zulu rebellion in Natal and argued during the case that even an Indian was entitled to justice and fair play.

('6', 299, 1, 2, 559984) 273. CAPE IMMIGRATION ACT
('6', 299, 2, 3, 560010) A new Immigration Act has been passed in the Cape, which, in our opinion, is much worse than the one in Natal.
('6', 299, 2, 4, 560121) For the present, we reproduce here only its worst features.
('6', 299, 2, 5, 560181) If an Indian not knowing English leaves the Cape without a permit, he cannot return even if he has been a resident.
('6', 299, 2, 6, 560297) That means that an Indian who does not know English will have to take out a permit each time he goes out and pay a fee of 1. Such a permit will be issued for a limited period only.
('6', 299, 2, 7, 560478) One cannot therefore have a permanent certificate.
('6', 299, 2, 8, 560529) Moreover, according to the Gezette in which the Act is published, a person applying for such a certificate will have to produce his photograph and other tokens of identity.
('6', 299, 2, 9, 560702) The clause requiring a permit is not relaxable because it is a part of the Act, and the Act has already received the assent of Lord Elgin.
('6', 299, 2, 10, 560841) The matter of the photograph, however, falls within the discretion of the Governor.
('6', 299, 2, 11, 560925) It is a local regulation, which can be amended from time to time.
('6', 299, 2, 12, 560991) We would advise the leaders of the Cape to fight out the question of the photograph without losing time.
('6', 299, 2, 13, 561096) It was a mistake that they allowed the Act to be passed in the first place.
('6', 299, 2, 14, 561172) But we will regard it as a major crime if the clause requiring a photograph remains.
('6', 299, 2, 15, 561257) If this practice is established in the Cape, it will have repercussions elsewhere, and offend religious sentiment.
('6', 299, 2, 16, 561372) We hope the leaders of the Cape will lose no time in taking up this matter.
('6', 299, 2, 17, 561448) We print elsewhere a translation of the main portions of the Act.

('6', 299, 6, 21, 561591) The comments appearing in The Natal Mercury of February 21 on Indian traders deserve to be known and understood.
('6', 299, 6, 22, 561704) The paper upholds the Indian traders and condemns the Ladysmith Council.
('6', 299, 6, 23, 561777) But it also shows the kind of rocks the ship of our trade has to steer clear of.
('6', 299, 6, 24, 561858) The Mercury says that Maritzburg merchants should consider it their good fortune that they have at all been granted licences.
('6', 299, 6, 25, 561984) Despite notices served on them, they had not kept proper account books.
('6', 299, 6, 26, 562056) It was only when another notice was served that they did so.
('6', 299, 6, 27, 562117) The Council was not bound to give notice twice, and without caring for the
('6', 300, 0, 1, 562192) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 301
('6', 300, 1, 2, 562236) members of the Labour Party, the Council issued licences out of kindness.
('6', 300, 1, 3, 562310) We should remember that such kindness is not likely to be repeated.
('6', 300, 1, 4, 562378) The Whites have already risen in opposition to the issuing of licences in this manner.
('6', 300, 1, 5, 562465) However, the danger has passed for this year.
('6', 300, 1, 6, 562511) But if it happens repeatedly, the holder of the licence will lose it and the Congress will not be able to help such a negligent person.
('6', 300, 1, 7, 562647) Every Indian trader should bear this in mind and devote full attention to the proper maintenance of books and to the cleanliness of his shop and his house.

('6', 300, 5, 11, 562886) his Committee has been doing excellent work as the two recent
('6', 300, 6, 12, 562948) cablegrams show.
('6', 300, 6, 13, 562965) One of them mentions the steps taken by the Committee in regard to the Ladysmith matter, as a result of which Lord Elgin has sent a strong communication.
('6', 300, 6, 14, 563119) The notice in which the decision not to issue licences after a year was published has had to be publicly withdrawn.
('6', 300, 6, 15, 563235) The second cablegram tells us that, though the Vrededorp Ordinance has been passed, the [Imperial] Government is again corresponding with Lord Selborne regarding the compensation to be paid to Indian residents.
('6', 300, 6, 16, 563446) From this and from Mr. Ritchs letters which we publish every week, it is clear that much benefit is likely to accrue to us from the appointment of the South Africa Committee.

('6', 301, 2, 3, 563728) We publish in this issue some photographs bearing on the Ordnance.
('6', 301, 2, 4, 563795) They will show that what Mr. Churchill has described as shanties are not shanties at all but magnificent buildings.
('6', 301, 2, 5, 563911) It was necessary to bring out this supplement [of photographs] because with these we could convince Lord Elgin that all the information sent to him from here should not be accepted as true.
('6', 301, 2, 6, 564101) Especially when the information relates to the Indians, it is hardly ever likely to be true, because the European officials here are found to share the anti Indian prejudices that the other Whites have.
('6', 301, 2, 7, 564304) Lord Selborne may have no knowledge of the condition of Indian houses in Vrededorp, and we cannot therefore blame him.
('6', 301, 2, 8, 564423) It is the officers below who do all the harm.
('6', 301, 2, 9, 564469) In this issue we also publish a table which will show that the loss suffered by the Indian community in Vrededorp amounts to 19,000. The table will lend much support to the agitation being conducted in London that Indians should be compensated for this loss.

('6', 301, 7, 14, 564958) PROHIBITED IMMIGRANTS
('6', 301, 8, 15, 564980) A person coming under any of the clauses below will be considered a prohibited immigrant and will not be allowed to enter: (1) a person who is unable, owing to insufficient education, to write out and sign, in the characters of any European language, an application to the satisfaction of the [Immigration] Officer; (2) a person who has no means of livelihood; (3) a person convicted of

('6', 302, 1, 3, 565966) EXAMINATION ON LANDING Every person landing at any port in the Colony shall be required to satisfy the Immigration Officer that he is not a prohibited immigrant and that he is exempted from the provisions of the Act.
('6', 302, 1, 4, 566183) Under this regulation every one who lands in the Cape Colony, save a minor under sixteen and a wife accompanying her husband, will have to fill in a printed form.
('6', 302, 1, 5, 566346) Those who do not fill in this form or those who, notwithstanding their having filled it in, are found to be [prohibited] immigrants, shall be liable to detention.
('6', 302, 1, 6, 566509) However, if a person wants to prove his right of landing, he will be given every reasonable facility to do so.
('6', 302, 1, 7, 566620) TEMPORARY PERMITS Temporary permits will be issued to those who wish to enter in order to tranship or to reside temporarily in it for a reasonably necessary purpose on payment of a fee of 1 and of a reasonable sum to be deposited as security.
('6', 302, 1, 8, 566863) The deposit shall bc refunded to the holder of the permit if he returns within the period for which the permit is issued.
('6', 302, 1, 9, 566985) However, if a permit holder overstays, he will forfeit his deposit and he may be arrested and prosecuted.
('6', 302, 1, 10, 567091) Any permit holder who gives a false or misleading address shall be liable to forfeit his permit and to prosecution.
('6', 302, 1, 11, 567207) The Chief Immigration Officer will have the power to issue a permit for three weeks and the Minister concerned the power to issue one for three months.
('6', 302, 1, 12, 567359) PHOTOGRAPHIC PERMITS Asiatics lawfully resident in the Colony can take out these permits.
('6', 302, 1, 13, 567449) The period for which they are available and the port at which the holder shall disembark on return to the Colony will be stated in these permits.
('6', 302, 1, 14, 567595) A fee of 1 will be charged for a permit; every permit shall contain a photograph of the holder and such particulars and marks as may be necessary for purposes of identification.

('6', 303, 2, 3, 567908) His Majesty the Amir visited Aligarh College on January 16, and he was welcomed with great honours.
('6', 303, 2, 4, 568008) We give here a translation from The Times of India of his address to the students of that College on the occasion.
('6', 303, 3, 5, 568123) SHIYA AND SUNNI
('6', 303, 4, 6, 568139) You are young.
('6', 303, 4, 7, 568154) Please listen to me.
('6', 303, 4, 8, 568175) Some people may have told you that I am a fanatic Sunni.
('6', 303, 4, 9, 568232) But does it mean that because I am a Sunni I am a fanatic?
('6', 303, 4, 10, 568291) I shall ask you a question: Will those of you who are Shiyas show greater regard to Hindus than to Sunnis?
('6', 303, 4, 11, 568398) Will you then believe that I, who am a Sunni, will prefer Hindus to Shiyas?
('6', 303, 4, 12, 568474) You must have read in the newspapers that, on Bakr Id, I prevented the killing of cows in Delhi lest it should hurt the feelings of Hindus.
('6', 303, 4, 13, 568614) If such is my regard for the Hindus, do you believe that I shall have less for the Shiyas?
('6', 303, 4, 14, 568705) I beg of you to give up from today the notion that I am a fanatic Sunni.
('6', 303, 4, 15, 568778) In Afghanistan my subjects include sunnis, Shiyas, Hindus and Jews.
('6', 303, 4, 16, 568846) I allow them all full religious freedom.
('6', 303, 4, 17, 568887) Do you call this fanaticism?
('6', 303, 4, 18, 568916) But one thing I must say: I cannot allow Shiyas to show disrespect to the three Khalifas.
('6', 303, 4, 19, 569006) If people think it fanatical of me to prevent Shiyas from showing such disrespect, well, I am a fanatic.
('6', 303, 5, 20, 569111) EDUCATION
('6', 303, 6, 21, 569121) Many people have spoken against the Aligarh College.
('6', 303, 6, 22, 569174) I have therefore come to find out the truth for myself.
('6', 303, 6, 23, 569230) I am thankful to the Government of India for letting Muslims assemble in such numbers to meet me and for giving me this opportunity to address you.
('6', 303, 6, 24, 569378) When I questioned the students of Aligarh College today, I was glad to find them well informed on religious matters.
('6', 303, 6, 25, 569495) I shall therefore be able to silence those who have been speaking against the College.
('6', 303, 7, 26, 569582) WESTERN EDUCATION
('6', 303, 8, 27, 569600) I would never say that you should not receive western education.
('6', 303, 8, 28, 569665) On the contrary, I would advise youand I would say this twice

('6', 304, 1, 2, 569771) overto exert yourselves to the utmost to receive that education.
('6', 304, 1, 3, 569836) But before you do that you must have education in Islam.
('6', 304, 1, 4, 569893) I have started the Habibia College in Afghanistan.
('6', 304, 1, 5, 569944) There I have allowed western education to be imparted in order that the students may grow up to be whole Muslims.
('6', 304, 1, 6, 570058) I found the students whom I examined today to be very well educated in religion.
('6', 304, 2, 7, 570139) DONATION TO COLLEGE
('6', 304, 3, 8, 570159) I am very sorry that, in view of the heavy expenditure I have to incur on education in my own country, I cannot help the Aligarh College as much as I should like to.
('6', 304, 3, 9, 570325) For the present, I shall give the College Rs. 500 every month.
('6', 304, 3, 10, 570388) It is my advice that those whom I examined today should be sent abroad for extensive travel.
('6', 304, 3, 11, 570481) They will prove successful in the future.
('6', 304, 3, 12, 570523) In addition to the Rs. 500 a month, I now donate Rs. 20,000 to the College.
('6', 304, 4, 13, 570599) WELCOME AT GWALIOR
('6', 304, 5, 14, 570618) After being honoured at Aligarh College His Majesty the Amir went to Gwalior where he was received with much pomp and ceremony.
('6', 304, 5, 15, 570746) He was Maharaja Scindias guest and stayed in his palace.

('6', 307, 2, 3, 573638) [Before March 9, 1907] 1
('6', 307, 3, 4, 573663) [MY DEAR CHHAGANLAL,]
('6', 307, 4, 5, 573685) I have your two letters.
('6', 307, 4, 6, 573710) I entirely agree with you.
('6', 307, 4, 7, 573737) I am glad you have got thirteen pages this time.
('6', 307, 4, 8, 573786) I am writing to Mr. West to persuade him.
('6', 307, 4, 9, 573828) I anticipated your objection about the splitting up of letters in Gujarati words.
('6', 307, 4, 10, 573910) I noticed the defect at Volksrust, where I was yesterday, and then and there wrote to Anandlal.
('6', 307, 4, 11, 574006) 2 I sent some Gujarati matter and a lot of English from Volksrust.
('6', 307, 4, 12, 574073) I hope you received both.
('6', 307, 4, 13, 574099) I enclose herewith an order for 1,000 handbills to be printed in Dutch and English.
('6', 307, 4, 14, 574183) The paper may be any size not less than octavo.
('6', 307, 4, 15, 574231) The English and Dutch should be as written on the enclosed.
('6', 307, 4, 16, 574291) You should send 1,000 copies of this to Mr. A. E. M. Gachalia, Box 97, Volksrust.
('6', 307, 4, 17, 574373) Please, also, put him down as a subscriber for Volksrust.
('6', 307, 4, 18, 574431) You may already have the name for Pretoria also.
('6', 307, 4, 19, 574480) I have agreed to charge 1 for 1,000 handbills.
('6', 307, 4, 20, 574527) Of course, the railage will be extra.
('6', 307, 4, 21, 574565) When the order is ready, you may send him your bill for 1 and subscription.
('6', 307, 4, 22, 574641) 1 He has promised to send you an advertisement also within a week or so.
('6', 307, 4, 23, 574714) If he does not send it, you may remind me.
('6', 307, 4, 24, 574757) I fear you will have to make some alterations in the Hamidia rules.
('6', 307, 4, 25, 574825) Mr. fancy properly drew my attention to the fact that the English rules were more numerous than the Gujarati.
('6', 307, 4, 26, 574935) You will, therefore, see the changes made by me.
('6', 307, 4, 27, 574984) I have struck off from 49 to 53 inclusive; 48 has been replaced by another to read the same as the Gujarati, so, also has No.
('6', 307, 4, 28, 575110) 22. You will see it more fully in the body of the rules which I am sending.
('6', 307, 4, 29, 575186) Mr. Fancy has made some necessary corrections in the Gujarati matter also, which, too, you should note.
('6', 307, 4, 30, 575290) You need not then send any further proof, but simply proceed with the printing.
('6', 307, 4, 31, 575370) I have not gone through the English word for word, but I take it that there are no mistakes of spelling, etc.
('6', 307, 4, 32, 575480) The [word,] Press, in Gujarati is printed in inverted type.
('6', 307, 4, 33, 575540) This, of course, should be corrected.
('6', 307, 4, 34, 575578) With reference to the closet arrangement for Harilal
('6', 307, 5, 35, 575631) 1 It is clear from the reference, towards the end of the letter, to Coovadias advertisement, which appeared regularly in Indian Opinion till March 2, 1907 but was then discontinued, that this letter was written before March 9, 1907. 2 This letter is not available.

('6', 308, 1, 3, 576052) I do not think that we should ask the employees to dig their trenches, unless they would do so of their own accord.
('6', 308, 1, 4, 576168) I felt exactly the same thing as you have.
('6', 308, 1, 5, 576211) I then argued it out for myself and gave the decision.
('6', 308, 1, 6, 576266) At the same time if the barrack people have been digging their own trenches, it simply means that you have to get the structure erected and leave Harilal and Dhoribhai to dig the trench.
('6', 308, 1, 7, 576453) The thing is that, somehow or other, it has got to be done: I am writing to Mr. Lachiram.
('6', 308, 1, 8, 576543) I have not heard from Tongaat regarding Gokaldas.
('6', 308, 1, 9, 576593) I note what you say about the desk for Harilal.
('6', 308, 1, 10, 576641) The enclosed household account is correct.
('6', 308, 1, 11, 576684) 1 strike A. Coovadias name off the list of subscribers and his advertisement, as he is broken.
('6', 308, 1, 12, 576779) I return the letter.
('6', 308, 1, 13, 576800) M. K. Desais letter with regard to Enavils business is not to be printed.
('6', 308, 1, 14, 576874) As a matter of fact, a copy of the same letter was shown by him to me and I told him that the letter could not go in.

('6', 308, 6, 20, 577136) In the Natal Government Gazette for the 19th February last is published a notice which requires appellants under the Dealers Licenses Act to deposit a sum of 12.10.0 to cover the travelling expenses of the members of the Board of Council sitting as a Court of Appeal.
('6', 308, 6, 21, 577404) As it is the unfortunate Indians who have to appeal as a rule, or rather go through the farce of an appeal, this fresh imposition makes their lot harder still and makes attainment of justice prohibitive.
('6', 308, 6, 22, 577608) We are perilously near to being asked next time to pay the travelling expenses of judges.
('6', 308, 6, 23, 577698) The rule, however, it seems to us, is clearly ultra vires.
('6', 308, 6, 24, 577757) The section which authorizes the Government to frame

('6', 309, 1, 2, 577904) regulations empowers them to regulate procedure and to create fresh burdens of an arbitrary nature.
('6', 309, 1, 3, 578004) We trust the Natal Indian Congress will promptly protest against this rule 1 and in the meanwhile we can safely say that appellants need not deposit the sum required under the notice in question.
('6', 309, 1, 4, 578200) Indeed, if we are correctly informed in the recent appeals no such deposits were required or made.

('6', 309, 4, 7, 578354) Our Johannesburg correspondent draws attention to a very serious state of affairs, if true.
('6', 309, 4, 8, 578446) It appears that, in spite of the disallowance or suspension of the Asiatic Law Amendment Ordinance, the Asiatic Department has been proceeding as if the Ordinance had been allowed.
('6', 309, 4, 9, 578627) It appears that the authorities have been inspecting permits and registration certificates held by British Indians, and at the same time, taking their ten finger prints.
('6', 309, 4, 10, 578797) There appears to be no justification for this high handed action.
('6', 309, 4, 11, 578863) We have nothing to say against the examination of permits and registration certificates indeed, we consider it to be a proper thing, and the only remedy for weeding out of the Colony those British Indians or Asiatics who may have entered it without permits.
('6', 309, 4, 12, 579121) But examination is one thing, and, under its cover, to call upon British Indians to give their finger impressions distinctly another.
('6', 309, 4, 13, 579255) The British Indians have consented to give their thumb prints as a matter of grace and conciliation.
('6', 309, 4, 14, 579356) The authorities should be satisfied therewith.
('6', 309, 4, 15, 579403) Mr. Henry has shown that thumb prints are, when properly taken, an invaluable test of identification.
('6', 309, 4, 16, 579505) It is, therefore, a gratuitous insult to offer to the community to take their finger impressions.
('6', 309, 4, 17, 579603) We congratulate the British Indian Association on having moved so promptly in the matter.
('6', 309, 4, 18, 579693) Our correspondent informs us also that the British Indian Association has circularized all the sub committees warning them
('6', 309, 5, 19, 579816) 1 The Congress wrote to the Colonial Secretary requesting the withdrawal of the notice but the request was not acceded to.

('6', 310, 5, 6, 580242) [TO THE EDITOR
('6', 310, 6, 7, 580257) THE TRANSVAAL LEADER JOHANNESBURG
('6', 310, 7, 8, 580291) SIR,] Your leading article entitled Who Rules This Colony? appearing in todays issue contains a strange series of illogical inferences drawn from an analysis of the Blue book recently published on the British Indian question in the Transvaal.
('6', 310, 7, 9, 580534) One of these specially needs refutation.
('6', 310, 7, 10, 580575) You state that those British Indians who are here should not be indiscriminately admitted to those political rights and privileges they do not enjoy in their own country.
('6', 310, 7, 11, 580746) My Association has several times pointed out in your columns that the British Indian community of the Transvaal has no intention whatever of claiming, and in fact does not claim, any political rights and privileges at all in this Colony.
('6', 310, 7, 12, 580984) British Indians simply demand the most elementary of civil rights, which is an entirely different matter.
('6', 310, 7, 13, 581090) I trust that you will take an early opportunity of correcting the mis statement of facts above referred to.

('6', 311, 2, 3, 581448) We have often had to write about the oppression we suffer at the hands of Englishmen.
('6', 311, 2, 4, 581534) We are very glad now to have an occasion for speaking well of them while thinking of the coming restoration of Dutch rule in the Transvaal.
('6', 311, 2, 5, 581674) The defeat of the Dutch in the war proved English tenacity.
('6', 311, 2, 6, 581734) The British, even when thrown flat on the ground, do not accept defeat, call it a virtue or a failing.
('6', 311, 2, 7, 581837) Once the war started, they alone knew how to win it.
('6', 311, 2, 8, 581890) The British saw, during the war, that the Dutch were not a people to be easily beaten; they too would not accept defeat.
('6', 311, 2, 9, 582011) In defeat, the Dutch had truly won.
('6', 311, 2, 10, 582047) Had they not been just a handful, they could never have been defeated.
('6', 311, 2, 11, 582118) That was the impression they made on the British.
('6', 311, 2, 12, 582168) Moreover, the British were shrewd enough to see that, in declaring war on the Dutch, they were themselves mainly at fault.
('6', 311, 2, 13, 582291) The party which had declared and fought the war was defeated at the last election.
('6', 311, 2, 14, 582374) The Liberals won and they decided to hand over the reins of Government to the Dutch.
('6', 311, 2, 15, 582459) As a result, General Botha and his colleagues have formed the Transvaal Ministry.
('6', 311, 2, 16, 582541) Though they are now British subjects in the Transvaal, they are quite free.
('6', 311, 2, 17, 582617) They will now be able to take into the public services as many Dutchmen as they wish.
('6', 311, 2, 18, 582703) The air is thick with talk of helping the poor among the Dutch.
('6', 311, 2, 19, 582767) And the Dutch language has today gained in prestige by fifty per cent.
('6', 311, 2, 20, 582838) The Dutch are now to be seen in every town and village as before.
('6', 311, 2, 21, 582904) They are flushed with enthusiasm and are again in high spirits.
('6', 311, 2, 22, 582968) No matter what the Dutch have done to us, we ought to congratulate them, considering that they deserve what they have gained.
('6', 311, 2, 23, 583094) This [attitude] is an outstanding illustration of English liberality.
('6', 311, 2, 24, 583164) It is a matter of joy for us that we are associated with such a people.
('6', 311, 2, 25, 583236) We have a lesson to learn from this.
('6', 311, 2, 26, 583273) Why do the Dutch and the British both hate us?
('6', 311, 2, 27, 583320) We believe the root cause is not the colour of our skin, but our general cowardice, our unmanliness and our pusillanimity.
('6', 311, 2, 28, 583443) They will begin to respect us the moment we impress upon them that we can stand up to them.
('6', 311, 2, 29, 583535) There is no need actually to fight, but courage is necessary.
('6', 311, 2, 30, 583597) If a man kicks us, we take it lying down.
('6', 311, 2, 31, 583639) He therefore thinks that we deserve nothing better.
('6', 311, 2, 32, 583691) This is the

('6', 312, 1, 2, 583747) cowardice in us.
('6', 312, 1, 3, 583764) There is a kind of courage in receiving a blow without returning it; but we are not speaking of that courage here.
('6', 312, 1, 4, 583879) We receive kicks passively out of fear.
('6', 312, 1, 5, 583919) Making a false show of youthfulness, we waste our manhood in sensual pleasures and abuse our womenfolk.
('6', 312, 1, 6, 584023) Without understanding the true significance of marriage, we remain blindly absorbed in carnal enjoyment.
('6', 312, 1, 7, 584128) This is an example of our unmanliness.
('6', 312, 1, 8, 584167) In the Cape, we give our photographs [for proving our identity] In Rustenburg and Boksburg, out of fear, we give our finger prints.
('6', 312, 1, 9, 584299) Instead of entering the Transvaal openly and boldly, some of us do so wrongfully and surreptitiously.
('6', 312, 1, 10, 584401) This shows our pusillanimity.
('6', 312, 1, 11, 584431) We are well aware that these comments do not apply to all of us.
('6', 312, 1, 12, 584496) But the whole community has to suffer for such conduct on the part of a few.
('6', 312, 1, 13, 584573) That is the state we are in, and, we believe, we shall get out of it soon if, instead of finding fault with the British, we realize our own faults.
('6', 312, 1, 14, 584721) For the British who have today handed over the reins of Government to the Dutch will likewise give us our due.

('6', 312, 5, 18, 584907) It is shameful of the Rustenburg Indians to have surrendered their freedom by giving their full hand prints.
('6', 312, 5, 19, 585016) As the Gujarati proverb says, so long as the axe does not have a wooden handle to it, it cannot cut wood.
('6', 312, 5, 20, 585122) Rustenburg has served as the handle by starting the giving of finger prints.
('6', 312, 5, 21, 585199) If, as a result, the Indian community comes to harm, the blame will be with the Rustenburg Indians.
('6', 312, 5, 22, 585299) We are glad to find that prompt action has been taken by the British Indian Association.
('6', 312, 5, 23, 585388) 1 It is well that it has lodged a protest with the Government whose action appears to be totally illegal.
('6', 312, 5, 24, 585494) It is also a good thing that the Association has addressed letters to the Indian committees in all the towns.
('6', 312, 6, 25, 585604) This instance shows that the Transvaal Indians have to act with great caution.
('6', 312, 6, 26, 585683) Whatever steps are taken now should be taken in concert and in consultation with the Association.
('6', 312, 6, 27, 585781) Nothing need be

('6', 313, 5, 8, 586221) Messages in the papers indicate that an agitation for Home Rule is going on in Egypt.
('6', 313, 5, 9, 586307) Large meetings are being held and resolutions passed by the Egyptians in order to gain political power by driving out Lord Cromer 1. Writing strongly on the subject, the London Times says that the movement should be suppressed.
('6', 313, 5, 10, 586535) We do not believe it likely that it can be stopped thus.
('6', 313, 5, 11, 586592) There are some brave persons among the Egyptians; and education is widespread.
('6', 313, 5, 12, 586671) If the movement continues long enough, we believe that the British will grant self government to the Egyptians.
('6', 313, 5, 13, 586783) In keeping with British traditions it has first to be shown that people who make demands are prepared to die for them.
('6', 313, 5, 14, 586902) It is not enough to go on making verbal demands.
('6', 313, 5, 15, 586951) The British follow this rule in their own country and that is how they endure.

('6', 313, 9, 19, 587089) The Indian licence case of Port Shepstone which has been decided by the Supreme Court appears to be a discomfiture for us.
('6', 313, 9, 20, 587212) Yet, we need not get into a panic on that account.
('6', 313, 9, 21, 587263) We can use the case to convince the [Imperial] Government that, under the licensing act, the Indian community can never get justice.
('6', 313, 9, 22, 587396) Success in Mr. Gogas case 2 was just fortuitous.
('6', 313, 9, 23, 587445) The danger will remain so long as courts of law do not deal out pure justice.

('6', 314, 1, 3, 587770) We are not enamoured of the Supreme Court, but we want the right to appeal to that Court only because we know that we can get justice there.
('6', 314, 1, 4, 587911) If the Europeans oppose this, it only means that they fear justice.
('6', 314, 1, 5, 587979) In this matter the real campaign is to be waged through the Imperial Government.
('6', 314, 1, 6, 588060) We are convinced of the need to work for a solution at both levels bearing in mind that we may not succeed.
('6', 314, 1, 7, 588168) We are of the opinion that, as long as the Imperial Government does not exercise control or exert pressure over the local governments, we shall not succeed, nor can we win their favour.
('6', 314, 1, 8, 588354) We should bear this in mind and work at both ends.

('6', 314, 5, 12, 588465) Mr. James Godfrey who went to England for his education has now returned a barrister at law.
('6', 314, 5, 13, 588558) We congratulate him and extend to him a cordial welcome.
('6', 314, 5, 14, 588615) It is a day of joy for his parents and a proud day for the Indian community.
('6', 314, 5, 15, 588692) There will be very few parents in South Africa who have had the courage to take the risks which the Godfreys have taken for their children.
('6', 314, 5, 16, 588832) They have used all their property to give their sons and daughters a very good education.
('6', 314, 5, 17, 588922) If other Indian parents were to follow this example in large numbers, the bonds that bind the Indian community would soon break.
('6', 314, 5, 18, 589051) All of us admit the pressing need for education, but we are slow in acting on the belief.
('6', 314, 5, 19, 589141) Though Mr. James Godfrey has finished his academic education, he will start his [real] education only now.
('6', 314, 5, 20, 589248) Education is just a means.
('6', 314, 5, 21, 589275) If it is not accompanied by truthfulness, firmness, patience and other virtues, it remains sterile, and sometimes does harm instead of good.
('6', 314, 5, 22, 589416) The object of education is not to be able to earn money, but to improve oneself and to serve the country.
('6', 314, 5, 23, 589522) If this object is not realized, it must be taken that the money spent on education has been wasted.
('6', 314, 5, 24, 589622) We hope Mr. James Godfrey will put his education to good use and pass on the benefit of his learning to the Indian community.

('6', 315, 2, 3, 589856) PERMIT LAW
('6', 315, 3, 4, 589867) The authorities seem to have begun the examination of permits in every town.
('6', 315, 3, 5, 589944) Not only were the permits of Rustenburg Indians examined, but the police made them give their finger prints also.
('6', 315, 3, 6, 590058) After the finger prints had been taken, the Rustenburg Indians referred the matter to the Association and were told that none of them should have given finger prints.
('6', 315, 3, 7, 590225) The giving of finger prints has done no good.
('6', 315, 3, 8, 590271) It is likely that the authorities will cite this instance of some Indians who gave finger prints and argue that the Indian community had no objection to giving finger prints.
('6', 315, 3, 9, 590446) The British Indian Association has written letters to every town saying that the permits and the registers may both be produced for inspection on demand; that the authorities may be assisted in their work of scrutiny and all information required by them supplied; that thumb impressions may be given if required, but that any further demand may be unequivocally refused and the Association informed that the authorities demand finger prints.
('6', 315, 3, 10, 590888) All Indians must bear these four points in mind.
('6', 315, 3, 11, 590937) A telegram 1 has been sent to the Government saying that the people regard it an outrage that finger prints should have been taken at Rustenburg.
('6', 315, 3, 12, 591083) The question has been asked on whose orders the prints were taken and whether or not the practice would be discontinued.
('6', 315, 3, 13, 591204) The Transvaal Indians should take care that they do not get caught in the net that the authorities spread for them.
('6', 315, 3, 14, 591320) In reply to the Associations telegram, the authorities have inquired whether the objection is only to giving the impressions of all the fingers or if it extends to the thumb impression also.
('6', 315, 3, 15, 591511) In its reply 2
('6', 315, 4, 16, 591526) the Association has stated that, in accordance with the understanding with Lord Milner, it has no objection to Indians giving the thumb impression for obtaining permits.
('6', 315, 4, 17, 591696) The Association intends to assist the Government in the scrutiny of permits, but cannot agree about the giving of the ten fingerprints as this needlessly humiliates the Indian community.

('6', 316, 1, 2, 592031) TRANSVAAL PERMITS
('6', 316, 2, 3, 592049) Last week I wrote about the notice regarding persons staying in the Transvaal without permits, 1 In answer to an enquiry by the British Indian Association, Mr. Chamney has replied that those persons in the Transvaal who hold the old Dutch certificates will have permits issued to them up to March 31, and that all those who continue to live in the Transvaal after that date without permits will be prosecuted.
('6', 316, 2, 4, 592459) From this it is not to be inferred that a permit will necessarily be issued to anyone who holds the Dutch certificate.
('6', 316, 2, 5, 592578) These persons will have to produce evidence to the effect that the Dutch certificate belongs to the holder, and the holder was in the Transvaal immediately before the outbreak of the war and left the Colony because of it.
('6', 316, 2, 6, 592800) Every Indian resident in the Transvaal who possesses such evidence should take out a permit as soon as practicable.
('6', 316, 2, 7, 592916) But it should be remembered that, unless the applicant is granted a permit, he is not to surrender his register.
('6', 316, 3, 8, 593029) TRANSVAAL RULERS
('6', 316, 4, 9, 593046) General Botha has now completed the formation of his Ministry.
('6', 316, 4, 10, 593109) He has himself become Prime Minister; General Smuts has become the Colonial Secretary.
('6', 316, 4, 11, 593196) Mr. De Villiers heads the Departments of Justice and of Mines.
('6', 316, 4, 12, 593259) Mr. Hull is in charge of the Treasury, Mr. Rissick is the Minister for African Affairs and Mr. E. P. Solomon, the Head of the Public [Works?] Department.
('6', 316, 4, 13, 593413) Sir Richard Solomon has declined to accept any office.
('6', 316, 4, 14, 593468) Among the ministers, the Indian community will have to do mostly with Mr. De Villiers and Mr. Smuts.
('6', 316, 4, 15, 593569) It now remains to be seen what course things will take.
('6', 316, 5, 16, 593625) RULES FOR ASIATIC BAZAARS
('6', 316, 6, 17, 593651) The current number of the Government Gazette carries regulations governing Locations.
('6', 316, 6, 18, 593737) It appears that the idea of Locations has not yet been given up.
('6', 316, 6, 19, 593802) The object in publishing these regulations seems to be to keep alive a separate Asiatic Department anyhow.

('6', 317, 1, 3, 594190) Mr. Amod Saleji took a notable part in the fight against the Ordinance.
('6', 317, 1, 4, 594262) Dinners were given in his honour by Messrs Mamad Mamdu, M.P. Fancy, Bhanabhai, Essop Mian, Musa Dauji Karim, Gulam Mahomed Kadodia and others.
('6', 317, 1, 5, 594405) Mr. Fancy presented him with a gold locket and other articles.
('6', 317, 1, 6, 594468) He was also honoured and garlanded at the Surati mosque on Friday.
('6', 317, 1, 7, 594535) Mr. Amod Saleji came to South Africa 22 years ago and is now forty two years old.
('6', 317, 1, 8, 594617) He is visiting India after ten years.
('6', 317, 1, 9, 594655) Mr. Saleji is expected to leave Durban Port on March 20. It will take him nearly ten days to reach Durban from Johannesburg as on his way he will stop at many places which he has been invited to visit.
('6', 317, 2, 10, 594857) FOR INFORMATION OF BARBERTON INDIANS
('6', 317, 3, 11, 594894) The British Indian Association has received a communication from the Government about the Barberton Location.
('6', 317, 3, 12, 595004) It says that the Location will be made over to the municipality and that a 21 year lease can be taken out from that body.
('6', 317, 4, 13, 595126) INCREASE IN SOUTH AFRICA COMMITTEES EXPENDITURE
('6', 317, 5, 14, 595174) Last Sunday a meeting of the British Indian Association and the Anti Indian Law Fund Committee took place at the residence of Haji Ojer Ally.
('6', 317, 5, 15, 595316) Many members were present.
('6', 317, 5, 16, 595343) The Committee unanimously resolved to increase to 15 the nominal monthly honorarium that is being paid to Mr. Ritch and to remit an additional sum of 100 for the purpose.
('6', 317, 5, 17, 595514) It is a fact that there has thus been an addition of 100 to the sum of 300 originally fixed for remission to the Committee.
('6', 317, 5, 18, 595638) It will be difficult to secure a full time worker as capable even on a salary of 30. If Mr. Ritch had been well to do, he would not have cared to accept even this honorarium.
('6', 317, 5, 19, 595813) Every week we hear of his activities.
('6', 317, 6, 20, 595851) GENERAL BOTHA
('6', 317, 7, 21, 595865) General Botha has been invited by Lord Elgin to attend the Colonial Conference.
('6', 317, 7, 22, 595945) It is said that, if General Botha accepts the invitation, the British will welcome him heartily.

('6', 318, 2, 3, 596149) The Natal Indians met on Monday 1 night in large numbers to consider the question of traders licences and the municipal franchise.
('6', 318, 2, 4, 596280) The meeting seems to have been the largest on record.
('6', 318, 2, 5, 596334) The Advertiser calls it a record gathering, both in regard to the size of the audience and its enthusiasm.
('6', 318, 2, 6, 596441) Delegates attended from all parts of the Colony and perfect unanimity prevailed.
('6', 318, 2, 7, 596522) We congratulate the indefatigable Secretaries of the Congress on the admirable manner in which they organized the meeting.
('6', 318, 2, 8, 596645) The studiously moderate address of the chairman of the meeting and the array of facts presented by him should disarm all opposition.
('6', 318, 2, 9, 596778) Nothing could be fairer than the compromise offered by him on the intricate trading question.
('6', 318, 2, 10, 596872) Indeed Mr. Dawad Mahomed showed that he claimed for the Indian traders nothing more than what the reasonably minded colonists have admitted they are entitled to at the very least.
('6', 318, 2, 11, 597052) The first resolution 2 adopted by the meeting put in a concrete form the grievance of the community regarding the Licenses Act.
('6', 318, 2, 12, 597180) There can be no doubt that nothing less than an amendment of the present Act will satisfactorily meet the difficulty.
('6', 318, 2, 13, 597298) The second resolution 3 was the outcome of the recent licensing cases.
('6', 318, 2, 14, 597369) The contention of the Indian community is that, if with the possession of the municipal franchise by the Indian community, Indians have laboured under gross injustice at the hands of the municipal bodies, how much worse must the position become if the community is deprived of the municipal franchise.
('6', 318, 2, 15, 597671) The meeting, therefore, emphasized the necessity for protecting British Indian rate payers of Natal against the attempt to deprive them of the right to elect municipal councillors.
('6', 318, 3, 16, 597852) 1 March 11 2 The first resolution protested against the manner of enforcement of the Dealers' Licenses Act and requested the intervention of the local and Imperial Governments; it further demanded that the Act should be so changed as to safeguard vested rights.
('6', 318, 3, 17, 598114) 3 The second resolution requested the Imperial Government to safeguard the right of British Indian rate payers to vote at the municipal elections.
('6', 318, 3, 18, 598261) The Natal Manicipal Bill proposed the disfranchisement of British Indians at municipal elections.
('6', 319, 0, 1, 598359) 320 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 319, 1, 2, 598401) The two resolutions form a complete answer to the Colonial Patriotic Unionand show how necessary it is for the heads of the two communities to meet together and evolve a workable compromise.
('6', 319, 1, 3, 598592) Let us hope that Mr. Poynton, who we believe is a moderate man, will consider our proposal and win the esteem of the colonists by paving the way to a real settlement of the thorny question of Indian immigration and Indian competition.

('6', 319, 4, 6, 598882) Lord Selbornes despatch to Lord Elgin on the anti Asiatic Ordinance of the Transvaal has now been received.
('6', 319, 4, 7, 598990) We regret to have to say that, in spite of His Excellencys usual fairness, he has throughout the despatch shown himself as a partisan rather than an unprejudiced administrator and representative of the Sovereign.
('6', 319, 5, 8, 599203) We will deal for the present with the alleged influx of unauthorized Asiatics into the Transvaal.
('6', 319, 5, 9, 599301) We must unhesitatingly say that His Excellency has not produced a particle of evidence in support of the statement so repeatedly challenged by the Indian community of the Transvaal.
('6', 319, 5, 10, 599483) The evidence referred to by Lord Selborne is the report made by Mr. Burgess as to his examination of Indian passengers at the Coast.
('6', 319, 5, 11, 599616) It shows at best nothing more than that some Indians attempt to enter the Transvaal on permits not their own, and that such attempt is successfully arrested in its progress, even before Indians making the attempt have reached the Transvaal border.
('6', 319, 5, 12, 599864) Now the attempt on the part of individual Indians to effect an entry into the Transvaal without lawful authority has never been denied.
('6', 319, 5, 13, 600000) There is, however, no warrant for the inference, based on such attempts, that there is any successful entry.
('6', 319, 5, 14, 600109) As to the allegation of an organised agency trafficking in permits, there is not a tittle of evidence produced beyond undisclosed circumstances which have come to his (the Coast Agents) knowledge.
('6', 319, 5, 15, 600306) It is now the clear duty of the British Indian Association to call for the production of the evidence on which the statement is founded.
('6', 319, 5, 16, 600443) Till then, the case for the introduction of the Ordinance remains unproven.
('6', 319, 5, 17, 600519) Notwithstanding the fact, we find The Transvaal Leader basing an inflammatory article on Lord Selbornes despatch.
('6', 319, 5, 18, 600633) The Leader
('6', 320, 0, 1, 600644) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 321
('6', 320, 1, 2, 600688) gravely asks whether British Indians are to rule South Africa or the white men.
('6', 320, 1, 3, 600768) And all this because Lord Elgin has dared to do justice in the teeth of official opposition.
('6', 320, 1, 4, 600861) The Leader then goes on furiously to urge that any such attempt on the part of British Indians to rule South Africa should be resisted, if need be, by the shedding of blood.
('6', 320, 1, 5, 601035) We may, however, assure The Leader that no such heroic measures will be necessary, seeing that British Indians have no ambition to rule.
('6', 320, 1, 6, 601172) We would ask our contemporary to peruse the statement 1 presented by the Deputation to Lord Elgin and we promise that it will show why it was that Lord Elgin vetoed the Ordinance.

('6', 320, 4, 9, 601405) We print elsewhere a report 2 of the mass meeting at Durban, to which we invite the attention of all our readers.
('6', 320, 4, 10, 601519) That such a large meeting was held and attended by delegates from different places is evidence of the earnestness and energy of the Congress Secretaries.
('6', 320, 4, 11, 601673) The resolutions passed at the meeting are bound to have some effect on the Imperial Government as also on the local Government.
('6', 320, 4, 12, 601801) But we must sound a note of warning that the effect produced so far will disappear if we do not follow up the resolutions with appropriate action, and we shall then be falling from the flame into the fire.
('6', 320, 5, 13, 602007) Such meetings have always to be followed up with much work.
('6', 320, 5, 14, 602067) In pursuance of these resolutions we shall have to write letters to the Government and trouble them again and again.
('6', 320, 5, 15, 602184) We may even have to send telegrams.
('6', 320, 5, 16, 602220) All this work will cost money.
('6', 320, 5, 17, 602251) We should remember that the Congress has no money now.
('6', 320, 5, 18, 602306) All the money has been borrowed from banks.
('6', 320, 5, 19, 602350) It is difficult to organize a big struggle in these circumstances.
('6', 320, 5, 20, 602417) Therefore the first need is to collect money.
('6', 320, 5, 21, 602463) The second thing is to remember Mr. Peeran Mahomeds warning.
('6', 320, 5, 22, 602524) As long as we do not learn to keep our houses clean, we are bound to suffer.
('6', 320, 5, 23, 602601) That means that, if we want any good to come out of such big meetings, we must reform ourselves.

('6', 321, 2, 3, 602924) Some well wishers have suggested that the Gujarati section should be expanded.
('6', 321, 2, 4, 603003) They believe that people have begun to realize the value of Indian Opinion and its services.
('6', 321, 2, 5, 603096) We have accepted the suggestion and added some pages in this issue itself, and from now on we shall have thirteen instead of twelve pages [of Gujarati].
('6', 321, 2, 6, 603249) We hope that this increase in size will be appreciated.
('6', 321, 2, 7, 603305) We must, however, point out that Indian Opinion is not yet in a position even to pay full wages to its workers.
('6', 321, 2, 8, 603417) It is only because they have some patriotic fervour that the journal continues to come out.

('6', 321, 6, 12, 603576) ORDINANCE BLUE BOOK
('6', 321, 7, 13, 603596) The Blue book containing the correspondence that passed between Lord Selborne and Lord Elgin regarding the Ordinance has now been received.
('6', 321, 7, 14, 603736) It shows that Lord Elgin, who had heard only one side of the case, had at first approved the Ordinance, but his eyes were opened after he had heard the Deputation that visited England, and then he refused it [Royal] assent.
('6', 321, 7, 15, 603960) Lord Selborne, however, sticks to his earlier position and says in his reply that his hands have been weakened by Lord Elgin listening to the Deputation.
('6', 321, 7, 16, 604114) Among the reasons for passing the Ordinance, Lord Selborne mentions many Indians entering without permits.
('6', 321, 7, 17, 604221) In support he quotes the report of Mr. Burgess, which says that he had personally seen several Indians holding false permits and that some had even erased the thumb impressions on them.
('6', 321, 7, 18, 604407) Even if some of these statements are true, it only shows that people are not able to enter wrongfully and that those attempting to do so can in fact be stopped.
('6', 321, 7, 19, 604568) There are some more points worth noticing in Lord Selbornes letter, which we shall see later.
('6', 321, 7, 20, 604662) Commenting on this Blue book, The Leader and The Star say
('6', 322, 0, 1, 604720) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 323
('6', 322, 1, 2, 604764) that, whatever the situation may be, the Indians will be registered.
('6', 322, 1, 3, 604833) The Leader goes so far as to say that the whites will even fight to achieve their object.
('6', 322, 1, 4, 604923) The Association is preparing to reply to the statements in the Blue book.
('6', 322, 2, 5, 604997) PERMIT CASES
('6', 322, 3, 6, 605010) Cases of possession of false permits occur occasionally in Johannesburg.
('6', 322, 3, 7, 605083) Some persons were arrested recently, and are being served with notices to leave the Colony.
('6', 322, 3, 8, 605175) It is because people enter in this manner that the other Indians have to suffer so much hardship.
('6', 322, 4, 9, 605273) GENERAL BOTHA AND HIS MINISTRY
('6', 322, 5, 10, 605304) The residents of Pretoria gave a dinner to General Botha and his cabinet colleagues.
('6', 322, 5, 11, 605389) Many prominent persons attended it.
('6', 322, 5, 12, 605425) In his speech General Botha thanked the British and acknowledged that they had been very liberal in handing over the reins of Government to the Boers.
('6', 322, 5, 13, 605576) As a result, the Dutch would remain loyal subjects of King Edward.
('6', 322, 5, 14, 605643) The General further said that the Transvaal had been very much in the public eye, but that the people should let bygones be bygones and give the country a respite so that measures to promote its prosperity could be undertaken.
('6', 322, 5, 15, 605870) The Boers wished to live happily and allow others to do likewise.
('6', 322, 5, 16, 605936) They would treat the Kaffirs justly and would not harass the mine owners.
('6', 322, 5, 17, 606010) The Dutch and the British, as indeed the Dutch and English languages, were equal in his eyes.
('6', 322, 5, 18, 606104) This speech was generous and conciliatory.
('6', 322, 5, 19, 606147) If it is lived up to, every one will be able to live happily under the Dutch regime.

('6', 322, 10, 24, 606346) CHHAGANLAL,
('6', 322, 11, 25, 606358) I am sending you today some sheets of the Ramayana 2. The figures on the left indicate page numbers.

('6', 323, 1, 3, 606674) I went over them last night and found the selection quite satisfactory.
('6', 323, 1, 4, 606746) However, you may write to me if you have any suggestion to make.
('6', 323, 1, 5, 606811) While reading the proofs, compare them with the original book.
('6', 323, 1, 6, 606874) Do not depend for spelling, etc., on the copy sent by me.
('6', 323, 1, 7, 606932) Please send me the proofs before printing.
('6', 323, 1, 8, 606975) Printing has to be done after deciding about the format, etc., of the book.
('6', 323, 1, 9, 607051) And I believe it is desirable to print off after composing as much material as we have types for.
('6', 323, 1, 10, 607149) Types necessary for job work, etc., should be kept apart.
('6', 323, 1, 11, 607207) I shall send the rest of the Ramayana in small instalments.
('6', 323, 1, 12, 607267) I think a thousand copies should be printed.

('6', 324, 6, 7, 608099) 300. ASIATIC LAW AMENDMENT ORDINANCE
('6', 324, 7, 8, 608136) The Asiatic Law Amendment Ordinance has re appeared as a draft Bill to amend Law 3 of 1885 and has already passed the third reading in the Legislative Assembly of the Transvaal.
('6', 324, 7, 9, 608314) 2 With the exception of the necessary verbal alteration, it is an exact replica of the original Ordinance.
('6', 324, 7, 10, 608421) We congratulate the authors of the anti Asiatic agitation in the Transvaal on their success in bringing the matter again to the fore, and on their phenomenal activity.
('6', 324, 7, 11, 608589) The latter is worthy of imitation by British Indians.
('6', 324, 7, 12, 608643) We frankly confess that we welcome the draft Bill as a challenge to British Indians in the Transvaal.
('6', 324, 7, 13, 608745) They have to show of what stuff they are made.
('6', 324, 7, 14, 608792) No new argument need now be
('6', 324, 8, 15, 608820) 1 Two thousand Indians were waiting to leave for Lobito Bay to work on the proposed Benguella Railway.
('6', 324, 8, 16, 608923) The sanction of the Indian Government was awaited.
('6', 324, 8, 17, 608974) In the meanwhile, the railway contractors had given an undertaking to the Natal Government that Indian labour would be well treated and returned to Natal or India on thc expiry of the engagement.
('6', 324, 8, 18, 609170) The officials of the Natal Indian Congress had arrived to attend a mass meeting of Indians to be held on March 22. Mr. Wylie then sent the following telegram to Gandhiji at Johannesburg: Mass meeting being held at noon today of Indians who are anxious to leave Natal for Lobito Bay, but cannot get away.
('6', 324, 8, 19, 609474) Dawad Mahomed, Peeran Omar, and Anglia havc been to me to know what attitude, if any, they should take up.
('6', 324, 8, 20, 609581) Before advising or acting, I should like to know your opinion.
('6', 324, 8, 21, 609644) My advice is they should not interfere in meeting in any way meantime; but might be present to see what actually takes place.
('6', 324, 8, 22, 609770) Please wire reply immediately. The telegram above was Gandhiji's reply.
('6', 324, 8, 23, 609842) The concurrence of the Indian Government in the proposal was announced at the meeting.
('6', 324, 8, 24, 609929) 2 The new law was termed the Asiatic Registration Act.
('6', 324, 8, 25, 609984) Gandhiji, however, continues to refer to it as the Ordinance.
('6', 325, 0, 1, 610046) 326 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 325, 1, 2, 610088) advanced.
('6', 325, 1, 3, 610098) There is no further argument left.
('6', 325, 1, 4, 610133) The draft Bill will test the power of the Imperial Government to protect, and the ability of the Indian community to enforce, the famous resolution 1 regarding passive resistance, as The Star described it.

('6', 325, 3, 6, 610365) 301. THE MALAY LOCATION
('6', 325, 4, 7, 610389) The Johannesburg Town Council, as will be seen from our news columns, will very shortly receive title to the Malay Location.
('6', 325, 4, 8, 610514) One of the conditions of the grant will be that the Town Council will have to compensate the inhabitants for the buildings erected by them and to find other Stands in lieu of those now occupied.
('6', 325, 4, 9, 610709) At first sight, the provision seems to be equitable.
('6', 325, 4, 10, 610762) But further consideration will reveal the fact that compensation does not include any payment in respect of the tenure or loss of rents, and so far as the present intentions of the Council are known, the giving of Stands means removal to Klipspruit.
('6', 325, 4, 11, 611012) Stand holders in the Malay Location, though, strictly speaking, only monthly squatters, were, up to the outbreak of war, at least as safe in their possession of Stands as the burghers of Vrededorp who occupied the Stands precisely on the same terms as the residents of the Malay Location.
('6', 325, 4, 12, 611301) When, therefore, we compare the handsome treatment meted out to the burghers with the treatment that is likely to be the lot of the residents of the Malay Location under the Government grant, we realize fully what the possession of a brown skin means.
('6', 325, 4, 13, 611553) If the Coloured people cannot show a legal title to anything they enjoyed during the Boer regime, their equitable right, no matter how strong, receives short shrift under the changed conditions.
('6', 325, 4, 14, 611748) Will Lord Selborne once more maintain that the change from the Republican to the British flag necessitates a partial robbery of the rights of the residents of the Malay Location?
('6', 325, 4, 15, 611927) For the paltry compensation that the Stand holders will receive for the buildings can ill repay them for years of undisturbed occupation which enables many a holder to derive a handsome income from rents paid by sub tenants and which is their means of livelihood.
('6', 325, 4, 16, 612191) And to add force to our argument, let us for the hundredth time recall the fact that every attempt made by the late President Kruger to remove the inhabitants of the Location not

('6', 326, 3, 4, 612650) 302. SOUTH AFRICA BRITISH INDIAN COMMITTEE
('6', 326, 4, 5, 612693) We suggest that all our readers carefully read Mr. Ritchs letter this week.
('6', 326, 4, 6, 612769) The work done by him, and through him by the British Committee, has been invaluable.
('6', 326, 4, 7, 612854) He has been working with great enthusiasm and tact.
('6', 326, 4, 8, 612906) We shall owe it to Mr. Ritch and the South Africa British Indian Committee if the Natal Municipal Bill is dropped, if the Vrededorp Indians receive compensation and if relief is secured at last from the oppressive Natal Licenses Act.
('6', 326, 4, 9, 613140) Mr. Ritch will not be able to work without the Committee, and without Mr. Ritch, the Committee cannot do much.
('6', 326, 4, 10, 613251) There is at present no one in London who can replace Mr. Ritch for vigilance and ability.
('6', 326, 4, 11, 613341) Sir Muncherji and our other well wishers do all they can to help us but not much can be done unless there is an able Secretary to bring them all together and to work under their guidance.
('6', 326, 4, 12, 613529) Almost weekly we see from Reuters cables that the Committee is active.
('6', 326, 4, 13, 613600) Last week the news was received that, in pursuance of the resolution passed at the mass meeting [in Durban], the Committee had written strongly to Lord Elgin.
('6', 326, 4, 14, 613759) This week we find that a debate was initiated by Lord Ampthill in the House of Lords.
('6', 326, 4, 15, 613845) The report and cablegrams printed elsewhere in this issue will show that, in the House of Commons too, questions were asked and answered about our grievances.
('6', 326, 4, 16, 614004) We owe all this to the efforts of the Committee and Mr. Ritch.
('6', 326, 4, 17, 614067) It is clear that they have been making considerable effort.
('6', 326, 4, 18, 614127) How is the Committee to continue and do more work?
('6', 326, 4, 19, 614178) Mr. Ritch has himself supplied the answer.
('6', 326, 4, 20, 614221) He writes that 250 a year will not suffice.
('6', 326, 4, 21, 614265) We have published elsewhere the accounts submitted by him showing how the money is spent.
('6', 326, 4, 22, 614355) Mr. Ritch had been drawing 25 per quarter, but the Committee has permitted him to draw 45, as 25 was not enough to meet even the deficit in his domestic budget.
('6', 326, 4, 23, 614516) What is paid to Mr. Ritch is not a salary.
('6', 326, 4, 24, 614559) The market value of his work cannot be less than 30 a month.
('6', 326, 4, 25, 614620) He does not seek money nor does he work for it.
('6', 326, 4, 26, 614668) He works because he feels [for the Indians in South Africa].
('6', 326, 4, 27, 614729) If his condition permitted it, he would not accept even a penny.
('6', 327, 0, 1, 614794) 328 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 327, 1, 2, 614836) Among the Committees expenses we see payments of 180 to Mr. Ritch, 50 to a paid employee and 50 as rent for the office.
('6', 327, 1, 3, 614956) Thus salaries and rent took away 280, leaving 20, which was too little to meet the Committees other expenses.
('6', 327, 1, 4, 615066) Even after we remit 50, the balance of the promised 300, the expenses will not be fully met.
('6', 327, 1, 5, 615159) The Anti Indian Law Fund Committee has resolved to send 100 more.
('6', 327, 1, 6, 615225) But we feel that it is absolutely necessary to spend up to 500 in England.
('6', 327, 1, 7, 615300) Expenses on this scale will, it appears, have to be maintained over two or three years.
('6', 327, 1, 8, 615388) If compensation is paid to the Vrededorp Indians, we can recover more than 500 from that [amount] alone.
('6', 327, 1, 9, 615493) Our expenses in England will be repaid a hundred times over if our traders can survive in Natal.
('6', 327, 1, 10, 615590) The attack on the inhabitants of the Malay Location continues.
('6', 327, 1, 11, 615653) If they can be successfully defended, that also will be a good return.
('6', 327, 1, 12, 615724) We therefore specifically appeal to all our readers to make the requisite effort to maintain the Committee.
('6', 327, 1, 13, 615832) The Natal Indian Congress has contributed 125. Out of the 50 yet to be sent, the Congress should pay 25 And just as the Transvaal has decided to contribute an additional 100, so must Natal too.
('6', 327, 1, 14, 616026) That is the duty of the Congress.
('6', 327, 1, 15, 616060) The Committee will be able to do its best only if money is remitted in this manner.
('6', 327, 1, 16, 616144) At present there is little likelihood of any help coming from the Cape, though efforts are being made.
('6', 327, 1, 17, 616247) Our request to the Indians in the Cape is that, if it is not possible for them to send a collective contribution, individuals may send us whatever they can.
('6', 327, 1, 18, 616404) We shall pass on the money, as from them, to the Committee.
('6', 327, 1, 19, 616464) Even if the Cape Indians consider their own position relatively safe, they should share in their countrymens adversities elsewhere.

('6', 327, 5, 23, 616665) The Natal Indian Congress did very well in holding the mass meeting.
('6', 327, 5, 24, 616734) 1 We can see from Reuters cablegram that the Committee has acted promptly on the resolutions passed at the meeting, and written strongly to Lord Elgin.
('6', 327, 5, 25, 616886) We congratulate the Congress Secretaries.

('6', 328, 1, 2, 617008) The Secretary and the Chairman of a body are regarded as its guardians.
('6', 328, 1, 3, 617080) The enthusiasm they displayed at the mass meeting they should evince in equal measure in the matter of funds for the Congress.
('6', 328, 1, 4, 617207) The present position of the Congress is so bad that it has been obliged to take an overdraft from the bank.
('6', 328, 1, 5, 617315) For this Messrs Dawad Mahomed and Omar Haji Amod have furnished personal guarantees.
('6', 328, 1, 6, 617400) It was very good of them to do so, but the Congress cannot function for long on overdrafts.
('6', 328, 1, 7, 617492) The work on licences is a huge task and a great deal of money will have to be spent on it.
('6', 328, 1, 8, 617583) To get the [Dealers] Licenses Act changed will require considerable effort as well as money.
('6', 328, 1, 9, 617676) The Congress, therefore, ought immediately to collect funds for the struggle over the licences and the municipal bills.
('6', 328, 1, 10, 617796) Delay in this respect, we feel, will only mean repentance later.
('6', 328, 1, 11, 617861) We understand that the Congress has started raising contribu tions.
('6', 328, 1, 12, 617929) We advise every patriotic Indian to help the Congress promptly and to the best of his ability.
('6', 328, 1, 13, 618024) To the Secretary and the Chairman we have to say that their first duty as guardians of the Congress is to place its finances on a sound footing.
('6', 328, 1, 14, 618169) We are sure that a months enthusiastic effort on their part will place the Congress in a comfortable position.

('6', 328, 5, 18, 618355) Malaria is taking a heavy toll in the neighbourhood of Durban.
('6', 328, 5, 19, 618418) It is said that nearly three hundred Indians have been buried on the other side of Umgeni.
('6', 328, 5, 20, 618509) The Corporation has started distributing quinine free of charge.
('6', 328, 5, 21, 618574) One philanthropic European has undertaken to supply medicine to all patients.
('6', 328, 5, 22, 618652) Many Indians have availed themselves of his offer.
('6', 328, 5, 23, 618703) At this juncture the Indian community should not lag behind.
('6', 328, 5, 24, 618764) We think it necessary that the leaders should come out, and go from place to place making inquiries about the victims of the disease and also arrange for their treatment.
('6', 328, 5, 25, 618935) People should be persuaded to maintain cleanliness and not let water stagnate in the vicinity.
('6', 328, 5, 26, 619030) The Congress should write to Dr. Murison for help.
('6', 328, 5, 27, 619081) We believe that it is

('6', 329, 1, 3, 619230) If he does so, Indians will have much relief and he will be able to do them a lot of good.
('6', 329, 1, 4, 619321) For the guidance of those who wish to help, we make the following suggestions: 1. simple food for the patient; 2. quinine as prescribed by the physician; 3. ensuring proper bowel movement; 4. removing vegetation, if any, from the neighbourhood; 5. draining of swamps, if any; 6. advising people to use mosquito nets where possible; 7. the avoidance of overcrowding; 8. cleanliness of latrines, and night soil to be covered with dry earth or ash.
('6', 329, 1, 5, 619767) These suggestions are very easy to carry out.
('6', 329, 1, 6, 619813) It has been found that a malarious region becomes free from disease as soon as the land in the neighbourhood is drained.

('6', 329, 5, 10, 619999) The report of the Volksrust permit case which we print elsewhere is worth reading.
('6', 329, 5, 11, 620082) The case of Shaikh Inas also brings out many things.
('6', 329, 5, 12, 620135) It is interesting to know how far Mr. Burgess interferes in Durban.
('6', 329, 5, 13, 620203) Not only does he examine those without permits but even others who have them.
('6', 329, 5, 14, 620281) It is quite evident that this procedure is improper.
('6', 329, 5, 15, 620334) For earlier when the person concerned appeared in court, the magistrate found his case in order, held his permit to be valid and acquitted him.
('6', 329, 5, 16, 620478) Yet Lord Selborne relies on Mr. Burgesss report and has made out that many persons come in with forged permits or none at all.
('6', 329, 5, 17, 620605) The case of Abdul Rehman is equally important.
('6', 329, 5, 18, 620652) He will produce witnesses who know him, and thus have himself acquitted.
('6', 329, 5, 19, 620725) But he would not have been able to come in either, if Mr. Burgess had had his way.
('6', 329, 5, 20, 620808) We feel that, if the Natal Indian Congress makes some effort in this matter, it can secure redress.
('6', 329, 5, 21, 620908) This kind of thing is happening in Durban, and hence it is within the purview of the Congress.
('6', 329, 5, 22, 621003) It can ask Mr. Smith and the Natal Government under what authority they carry out searches on board steamers.

('6', 330, 2, 4, 621293) Prince Tiano is a great Italian writer and has studied Eastern languages.
('6', 330, 2, 5, 621367) At present he is writing a history of Islam and intends to publish it in twelve parts.
('6', 330, 2, 6, 621454) The first part has already been published.
('6', 330, 2, 7, 621497) It is priced at .1.12.0 and runs into 740 pages of a large size.
('6', 330, 2, 8, 621562) A review of this book has appeared in The Spectator of December 22, of which we give a summary below: Prince Tiano gives in the first part the history of the first six years of the Prophets life, in which we see the Prophet as a statesman, law maker and general.
('6', 330, 2, 9, 621825) His power was growing from day to day.
('6', 330, 2, 10, 621864) The Jews opposed him strongly, but the Prophet broke their power.
('6', 330, 2, 11, 621930) Though there was not much pomp and splendour about him, his power was very great.
('6', 330, 2, 12, 622012) What he did, no other religious teacher has done.
('6', 330, 2, 13, 622062) He started preaching after the age of forty.
('6', 330, 2, 14, 622107) His was not a struggle for self interest, but for the good of others.
('6', 330, 2, 15, 622177) At the time of his death he was the head of a theocratic state.
('6', 330, 2, 16, 622241) He established a religion which came to enjoy world wide allegiance, thanks to his greatness and sense of justice.
('6', 330, 2, 17, 622356) He gave the Arabs a practical knowledge of world affairs, which they had lacked.
('6', 330, 2, 18, 622437) He moulded them into a single people and made them doughty fighters.
('6', 330, 2, 19, 622506) He ruled over different peoples; and today, though Muslims live under different governments, they believe in one God and His Prophet and maintain fraternal relations with others of the same faith.
('6', 330, 2, 20, 622703) What the nature of this brotherhood is and what the Muslim community can do in the modern world has to be considered whenever we think of the pan Islamic movement.
('6', 330, 2, 21, 622867) The foregoing is just a summary.
('6', 330, 2, 22, 622900) We have omitted a considerable portion which is critical.
('6', 330, 2, 23, 622958) But we would advise those who know English to read the whole article.

('6', 331, 2, 3, 623137) GENERAL BOTHA
('6', 331, 3, 4, 623151) General Bothas name is on everybodys lips here.
('6', 331, 3, 5, 623199) Everywhere the reaction to his speech has been very good.
('6', 331, 3, 6, 623257) The Times has written favourably of it and rates him very highly.
('6', 331, 3, 7, 623323) Others too could have said what General Botha did.
('6', 331, 3, 8, 623374) But the British have a special affection for one who speaks generously after having proved his valour in battle.
('6', 331, 3, 9, 623487) The lesson for us is that the Indian community too should show courage.
('6', 331, 3, 10, 623559) A move is afoot here to give a dinner to General Botha and his colleagues in the Ministry as was done at Pretoria.
('6', 331, 3, 11, 623674) It is said that the dinner will be at the Carlton Hotel on the 23rd.
('6', 331, 3, 12, 623743) General Botha is to go to England to attend the [Colonial] Conference.
('6', 331, 3, 13, 623814) We have suggested to our Committee in London that they should meet him and put our case before him.
('6', 331, 4, 14, 623914) TRANSVAAL PARLIAMENT
('6', 331, 5, 15, 623935) The Transvaal parliament is meeting on the 21st.
('6', 331, 5, 16, 623984) Every one is anxious to know what it will do.
('6', 331, 5, 17, 624030) The parliament will not be in session for long, and will adjourn after a sitting of two or three days only.
('6', 331, 6, 18, 624138) RAILWAY HARDSHIPS
('6', 331, 7, 19, 624156) The difficulties on the railways still continue.
('6', 331, 7, 20, 624205) Mr. Osman Latief has addressed a letter to the Manager about the inconvenience he had to undergo.
('6', 331, 7, 21, 624303) Correspondence is still going on between the Association and the General Manager over the right of Indians to travel by the morning and evening trains between Pretoria and Johannesburg.
('6', 331, 7, 22, 624489) The Manager has replied that the existing rules cannot be changed, where upon the Association has pointed out that the arrangement agreed upon was temporary, that it had resulted in much hardship, and hence the repealing of the provision preventing Indians from travelling by these trains is a felt need.

('6', 332, 1, 2, 624838) DELAGOA BAY RAILWAY
('6', 332, 2, 3, 624858) There has been a serious accident on the Delagoa Bay Railway.
('6', 332, 2, 4, 624920) Many passengers lost their lives in a landslide.
('6', 332, 2, 5, 624969) One of them was Dr. Jameson, a former Minister for Lands.
('6', 332, 2, 6, 625027) He retired when the new Ministry was formed, and was proceeding to England.
('6', 332, 2, 7, 625103) True to the saying Man proposes, but God disposes, Dr. Jameson died in this accident before reaching England.
('6', 332, 2, 8, 625213) His body was taken back to Pretoria and buried there.
('6', 332, 2, 9, 625267) ON THE ACCIDENT
('6', 332, 3, 10, 625283) The accident gives rise to many reflections.
('6', 332, 3, 11, 625328) Others died besides Dr. Jameson.
('6', 332, 3, 12, 625361) Some were injured.
('6', 332, 3, 13, 625380) Again, two hundred lives were lost when a French man of war was wrecked near Toulon.
('6', 332, 3, 14, 625465) Incidents such as these are constantly taking place but, intoxicated with this world of affairs, we see nothing.
('6', 332, 3, 15, 625578) As children, we read [in Gujarati]
('6', 332, 4, 16, 625613) Know, O Man, know thy mind And be afraid of death.
('6', 332, 4, 17, 625664) Beware of the destined hour To ashes thou shalt turn.
('6', 332, 4, 18, 625718) We live on in the world as if we had come here with a charter of immortality; and as the Gujarati proverb goes, we go on killing buffaloes for shoe laces.
('6', 332, 4, 19, 625873) But if we reflect seriously and look at things calmly, we realize that all is done in vain which is not done for others good.
('6', 332, 4, 20, 625999) If every minute, hour and day given to us is spent in good deeds, in patriotic service and in maintaining truth, we shall have nothing to fear even when death strikes us down.
('6', 332, 4, 21, 626175) Only a person who risks his life can fetch pearls from the depths of the sea.
('6', 332, 4, 22, 626253) Similarly, from the ocean of life we have to seek out tasks precious like pearls.
('6', 332, 4, 23, 626335) He alone who does not care for his life can do this.
('6', 332, 4, 24, 626388) If our actions are effeminate, we cannot remain manly.
('6', 332, 4, 25, 626443) Lord Selborne has made a biting remark that we are base and in the face of the least danger we think of bribing the officials.
('6', 332, 4, 26, 626570) We can refute this charge only if we have true spirit within us.
('6', 332, 5, 27, 626635) GIVING OF FINGER PRINTS
('6', 332, 6, 28, 626659) That this was started at Rustenburg I have already mentioned.
('6', 332, 7, 29, 626721) Now the Association has received a letter from the Rustenburg
('6', 332, 8, 30, 626783) 1 Vide Johannesburg Letter, 9 3 1907.
('6', 333, 0, 1, 626821) 334 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 333, 1, 2, 626863) Committee saying that the paper on which the finger prints of some people were obtained at the instance of the Committee has been burnt.
('6', 333, 1, 3, 627000) For this Rustenburg deserves our congratulations.
('6', 333, 1, 4, 627050) Indians in other places should heed this warning and not give the ten finger impressions under any circumstances.
('6', 333, 2, 5, 627164) VREDEDORP ORDINANCE
('6', 333, 3, 6, 627184) It has been suggested by the Johannesburg municipality that the Vrededorp Ordinance may be put into effect from July 1. Meanwhile, the South Africa British Indian Committee has been active about obtaining compensation.
('6', 333, 4, 7, 627403) MALAY LOCATION On the subject of handing over the Malay Location to the Johannesburg Town Council, the Government have written that, as soon as it agrees to certain conditions, it will be granted a permanent lease.
('6', 333, 4, 8, 627618) One of the conditions is that, should the Council evict the residents of the Malay Location, it should provide suitable Stands elsewhere for the evicted and also pay compensation, as determined by a tribunal, for buildings already erected by them in the Location.
('6', 333, 4, 9, 627882) This means that the inhabitants of the Malay Location will not be compensated for their right to the Stands which, for many years now, they have believed to be theirs; only the present value of the structures will be paid.
('6', 333, 4, 10, 628105) That is to say, the payment will vary from 50 to 150. The Malay Location Committee should start an agitation from today.
('6', 333, 4, 11, 628226) It is probable that the agreement between the Government and the Council will soon be signed.
('6', 333, 5, 12, 628320) PERMITS
('6', 333, 6, 13, 628328) Only a few days now remain for those persons who are now resident in the Transvaal, hold old registers but had left the territory just before the war, to apply for new permits.
('6', 333, 6, 14, 628505) It should be remembered that, after March 31, no applications will be entertained.

('6', 334, 2, 4, 628784) Almost word for word it is identical with the Ordinance which was cancelled.
('6', 334, 2, 5, 628861) We here have an instance of the tenacity of the Europeans.
('6', 334, 2, 6, 628920) Whatever they undertake they see through.
('6', 334, 2, 7, 628962) With us the first flush of heroism is seen to die away soon.
('6', 334, 2, 8, 629023) This is a time of real test.
('6', 334, 2, 9, 629052) If the Transvaal Indians are prepared to go to gaol, they have nothing to fear.
('6', 334, 2, 10, 629132) We cannot say whether the Imperial Government will cancel this Ordinance or not.
('6', 334, 2, 11, 629213) We would suggest that every Indian male should call to mind, on this occasion, the great deeds of British women.
('6', 334, 2, 12, 629326) Action is more necessary than talk.

('6', 335, 3, 4, 630231) DEAR SIR WILLIAM, I am obliged to you for your letter regarding Dr. Oldfields contributions.
('6', 335, 3, 5, 630324) I write this to request your very active interest in the matter of the Ordinance, which has been re introduced in the new parliament.
('6', 335, 3, 6, 630458) I venture to think that the matter has not been discussed in India, as it might be.
('6', 335, 3, 7, 630542) The result will be that it will not be thoroughly dealt with by the publicists in India.
('6', 335, 3, 8, 630631) I had a letter from Mr. Frazer of The Times of India saying that, if the idea of a special committee for this purpose were taken up, he would gladly co operate.
('6', 335, 3, 9, 630792) If you could kindly suggest to public men in India the desirability of forming such a committee, I think that it will be taken up.
('6', 335, 3, 10, 630923) I have written to the Secretary of the South Africa British Indian Committee suggesting that a deputation should meet General Botha, and discuss this question.

('6', 336, 7, 8, 631994) MY DEAR CHHAGANLAL,
('6', 336, 8, 9, 632014) Each week you will be glad to learn we run short of Indian Opinion.
('6', 336, 8, 10, 632082) Today, if you had sent 100 copies, they would have gone.
('6', 336, 8, 11, 632139) I think, therefore, it would perhaps be as well to send here next week 200 copies, because there is bound to be a very great demand.
('6', 336, 8, 12, 632272) You may also send about 2 dozen copies of the current issue.
('6', 336, 8, 13, 632333) I have instructed Hemchand to accept payment from those who may come here on the promise of supplying them with a copy.
('6', 336, 8, 14, 632453) If they cannot be sold, I will keep them.
('6', 336, 8, 15, 632495) You will, of course, take care for the present to print one or two hundred extra copies over and above the copies requisitioned.
('6', 336, 8, 16, 632624) The two hundred copies for next week must be included in the requisition.

('6', 337, 2, 3, 632878) [JOHANNESBURG, March 29, 1907] [Resolution 1] 2 This meeting of British Indians, convened under the auspices of the British Indian Association, hereby respectfully protests against the passage of the Asiatic Law Amendment Bill by the new Transvaal Parliament, in that the Bill is unnecessary and degrading to the British Indian community.
('6', 337, 2, 4, 633217) [Resolution 2] 3 This meeting of British Indians convened under the auspices of the British Indian Association denies the allegation of illegal influx of British Indians on a wholesale scale, and, in order to satisfy the Government and popular prejudice, offers to submit to voluntary regis tration, as was done by the community in 1904 under Lord Milners advice, and in the manner sketched in the Chairmans speech thus practically fulfilling all the requirements of the Bill without its offensive character.
('6', 337, 2, 5, 633726) [Resolution 3] 4 In the event of the humble proposal embodied in Resolution 2 not being accepted by the local Government, this meeting hereby requests full Imperial protection by reason of the fact that British Indians have no voice in the choice of the legislators, and represent a very small and weak minority.
('6', 337, 2, 6, 634039) [Resolution 4] 5 That the Chairman be, and is, hereby authorized to submit the resolutions passed by this meeting of British Indians, by wire or cable, to the local Government and to the Right Honble the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Right Honble the Secretary of State for India, and His Excellency the Governor General of India.

('6', 337, 4, 8, 634402) 1 These resolutions were passed at a mass meeting, attended by delegates fiom all parts of the Transvaal, on March 29, 1907. It is likely that they wcre drafted by Gandhiji.
('6', 337, 4, 9, 634576) 2 This was moved by H. O. Ally.
('6', 337, 4, 10, 634608) 3 This was moved by Abdul Rehman of Potchefstroom.
('6', 337, 4, 11, 634659) 4 This was moved by Nadirshah A. Cama of Johannesburg.
('6', 337, 4, 12, 634714) 5 This was moved by Imam Abdul Kadir Bawazeer of Johannesburg.

('6', 338, 1, 2, 634821) 314. THE DEALERS LICENSES ACT
('6', 338, 2, 3, 634851) The reply 1 of the Natal Government to the Natal Indian Congress regarding the imposition of a heavy fee against a rule under the Dealers Licenses Act is very unsatisfactory, except in so far as the reply shows an anxiety on the part of the Government to justify its action; but the analogy given from the Liquor Licences and the Road Boards Act is entirely misleading.
('6', 338, 2, 4, 635221) The Liquor Licences Ordinance and laws are naturally and always restrictive to trade in liquor.
('6', 338, 2, 5, 635317) The policy of the legislature, therefore, naturally is to put as many obstacles as possible in the way of those licences being multiplied.
('6', 338, 2, 6, 635456) It may be retorted, it is true, that such is also the policy of the Dealers Licenses Act so far as Indians are concerned, but we think that the Government could hardly take up such a position.
('6', 338, 2, 7, 635649) The hardship created by the Act is great enough in that absolute discretion as to the granting of licences rests with the Appellate Boards.
('6', 338, 2, 8, 635789) To impose a heavy penalty, for the fee of 12 10s is nothing less, would be, practically, to bar even an approach to these Boards.
('6', 338, 2, 9, 635919) The analogy of the Road Boards also cannot hold good, because the interests involved are of a totally different nature.
('6', 338, 2, 10, 636039) They regulate special rights and do not create social disabilities, whereas the Dealers Licenses Act specifically restricts a natural right, which has hitherto been considered to be a vested right.
('6', 338, 2, 11, 636237) We undoubtedly think that it is the duty of the Congress to pursue the matter, until the imposition shall have been removed.

('6', 338, 5, 14, 636421) The Transvaal Indians are again confronted with the same situation that they faced during September last.
('6', 338, 5, 15, 636527) Today every one is watching to see what they will do next.
('6', 338, 6, 16, 636586) 1 The Government in its reply had said: The rule requiring appellants under Act 18 of 1897 to deposit 12 is a proper one, and within the authority given by the Act.
('6', 338, 6, 17, 636751) I may say that the rule is similar to others passed in connection with similar acts.
('6', 338, 6, 18, 636836) It is almost identical with one of the rules under the Liquor Act; and, under the Road Boards Act, 1901, a deposit of 15 to 25 is similarly required to be made.
('6', 339, 0, 1, 636997) 340 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 339, 1, 2, 637039) All Indians will be guided by what the Transvaal Indians do.
('6', 339, 1, 3, 637100) What happens in the Transvaal may well happen all over South Africa.
('6', 339, 2, 4, 637169) NOTHING VENTURE, NOTHING HAVE
('6', 339, 3, 5, 637199) According to the saying, Nothing venture, nothing have, if the Transvaal Indians do not rigidly adhere to the resolution on going to gaol, they will lose everything.
('6', 339, 3, 6, 637365) Not only they, but other South African Indians also will lose their rights.
('6', 339, 3, 7, 637441) If the Indian community in the Transvaal does not carry out the resolution in regard to going to gaol, it will be eating its own words.
('6', 339, 3, 8, 637577) The Europeans will laugh at the Indians.
('6', 339, 3, 9, 637618) They will think us timid and cowardly and take it that we shall endure any burden imposed on us.
('6', 339, 3, 10, 637715) No one will put any faith in our word, whether written or spoken.
('6', 339, 4, 11, 637781) IF BILL IS PASSED
('6', 339, 5, 12, 637799) If this Bill is passed, the Transvaal Government will soon draft other bills, and the Indian community will of its own lose its rights one after another.
('6', 339, 5, 13, 637953) The laws which obtain in the Orange River Colony will be enacted in the Transvaal also and later in all the other places.
('6', 339, 5, 14, 638075) There is already talk today of relegating all the traders to Bazaars, of sending people to Klipspruit thirteen miles away from the Malay Location, and entirely abolishing the right of Indians to own land outside a Location.
('6', 339, 5, 15, 638299) If, therefore, the Indian community abandons the resolution on courting imprisonment, we believe that it will be impossible to get redress in any of the matters.
('6', 339, 5, 16, 638461) If we lose our reputation this time, we shall never recover it.
('6', 339, 5, 17, 638525) It is our belief that there is nothing worse than withdrawing a threat once held out.
('6', 339, 6, 18, 638611) OTHER REASONS FOR OPPOSING ORDINANCE
('6', 339, 7, 19, 638648) These are listed below: 1. Under the Ordinance all (existing) permits will be withdrawn and new ones issued after fresh inquiry.
('6', 339, 7, 20, 638777) 2. These permits will have to be produced before a Kaffir or any other constable.
('6', 339, 7, 21, 638859) 3. Licences will not be issued to those who do not produce the permits.
('6', 339, 7, 22, 638931) 4. Even when the permit is produced, the police have the right to
('6', 340, 0, 1, 638997) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 341
('6', 340, 1, 2, 639041) lock up a man for the night.
('6', 340, 1, 3, 639070) 5. Even a child of eight years will have to be registered by its parents, and its identification marks noted.
('6', 340, 1, 4, 639180) 6. It is not the people with forged permits or without permits who will have to face this harassment, since they will have left the Transvaal.
('6', 340, 1, 5, 639323) It is the others with valid permits who will have to go through it all.
('6', 340, 1, 6, 639395) 7. All the officers have said that the new permits will carry the impressions of all the ten digits.
('6', 340, 1, 7, 639496) 8. There is a great difference between giving our thumb impressions in the past and the same provision under the new law.
('6', 340, 1, 8, 639618) So far, the thumb impression was given voluntarily, now it is made compulsory under the law.
('6', 340, 1, 9, 639711) 9. Hitherto the giving of thumb impressions was not a statutory requirement, so that it had no consequences elsewhere, but now under the new law, it will have consequences everywhere.
('6', 340, 1, 10, 639895) 10. If a stranger reads this Ordinance, he will only get the impression that those to whom it applies must be thieves, bandits or traitors.
('6', 340, 1, 11, 640035) 11. The clauses of the Ordinance are such that these can only apply to criminals.
('6', 340, 2, 12, 640117) 12. The reason advanced for the Ordinance is also of the same nature: the leaders of the Indian community secure entry for Indians into the Transvaal under false pretextswhich means that the leaders are criminals.
('6', 340, 2, 13, 640331) 13. The Ordinance raises the question whether the Indian community has any status at all.
('6', 340, 3, 14, 640421) 14. If the Indian community submits to this Ordinance, the result will be that Indians like Sir Muncherji Bhownaggree who may enter the Transvaal will also be required to take out permits with finger prints.
('6', 340, 3, 15, 640629) The responsibility for this will rest on the Transvaal Indians.
('6', 340, 3, 16, 640693) 15. The Ordinance applies only to Asiatics, and not to Cape Boys, Kaffirs, or Malays.
('6', 340, 3, 17, 640779) That means that all these three communities will laugh at the Indians.
('6', 340, 3, 18, 640850) Supposing an Indian marries a Malay.
('6', 340, 3, 19, 640887) No one will be able to ask the Malay to produce a pass, but everywhere the Kaffir police will accost the Indian and demand, Your pass,
('6', 341, 0, 1, 641022) 342 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 341, 1, 2, 641064) please! This means that the status of the Indian will be lower than that of his Malay wife.
('6', 341, 1, 3, 641156) Other such reasons can also be given.
('6', 341, 1, 4, 641194) Yeaders should deeply ponder over the foregoing reasons and consider whether it is not better to go to gaol than to suffer such indignity.
('6', 341, 1, 5, 641333) To take out a pass under the Ordinance is, we believe, like permanent imprisonment.
('6', 341, 1, 6, 641417) In comparison with that, there is nothing wrong in going to gaol for a few days or months.
('6', 341, 1, 7, 641508) On the contrary, besides bringing in some gain, it will redound to our credit.
('6', 341, 1, 8, 641587) The other permanent imprisonment will cause us loss and discredit.
('6', 341, 1, 9, 641654) It must be remembered that the resolution about courting imprisonment has already been passed by the Indian community and announced to the whole world.
('6', 341, 1, 10, 641806) If the Ordinance was not acceptable in December, how can it be so now?
('6', 341, 1, 11, 641877) As far as that Ordinance is concerned, the pledge about going to gaol must stand for ever.
('6', 341, 1, 12, 641968) We request the Indian community to bear all this in mind and to adhere firmly to the resolution on courting imprisonment.
('6', 341, 1, 13, 642090) And we pray to God to give us the courage to renew that pledge.
('6', 341, 2, 14, 642154) BRAVE WOMEN OF BRITAIN
('6', 341, 3, 15, 642177) We still receive cables from Britain regarding the struggle by some brave women.
('6', 341, 3, 16, 642258) All of them go to gaol instead of paying fines.
('6', 341, 3, 17, 642306) Though they have not won their rights so far, they have not lost heart.
('6', 341, 3, 18, 642378) Instead, they believe that even though they themselves may not get the rights, their daughters will get them as a result of their struggle.
('6', 341, 3, 19, 642518) Now about this resolution on gaol going, no one must argue that he will go to gaol only if all the other Indians do so.
('6', 341, 3, 20, 642638) It is the man with courage who will have to go to gaol.
('6', 341, 3, 21, 642694) We have to follow the example of the women referred to above.
('6', 341, 3, 22, 642756) They go to gaol, though they are very few in number, and thus draw the attention of the world to their cause.
('6', 341, 3, 23, 642866) We earnestly request all our readers to have this article imprinted on their mind, and to act with great deliberation.

('6', 342, 2, 3, 643109) At this juncture, it is the duty of Indians in the Cape and Natal to hold meetings expressing sympathy with the Transvaal Indians.
('6', 342, 2, 4, 643240) They should, moreover, pass resolutions and send them to the Imperial Government.
('6', 342, 2, 5, 643322) It will also bc a good thing if Indians from every village and town were to pass resolutions and write to the Government respectfully saying that the law is oppressive and should be withdrawn.
('6', 342, 2, 6, 643515) It may be remembered that cablegrams in support of the Transvaal Ordinance were sent to Lord Elgin by whites from every town.
('6', 342, 2, 7, 643641) Everywhere the speeches should be reasonable and good tempered.

('6', 342, 6, 11, 643780) An Englishman named Stone intends to take Indian labourers to a place called Lobito Bay in Portuguese Africa a thousand miles to the north of the Cape.
('6', 342, 6, 12, 643932) He wants to take Indians there to work on the railway which a British company is constructing.
('6', 342, 6, 13, 644027) The question has arisen if the Indian community should encourage this proposal.
('6', 342, 6, 14, 644107) The President of the Durban Sanitary Association has published certain facts which indicate that the arrangements made by Mr. Stone in Durban for the Indians are altogether bad.
('6', 342, 6, 15, 644285) The building that he has rented for them is small and insanitary.
('6', 342, 6, 16, 644351) If this is true, we should consider whether Indian labourers are likely to gain anything by going to Lobito Bay.
('6', 342, 6, 17, 644464) Mr. Stone has also received the permission of the Government of India.
('6', 342, 6, 18, 644535) He therefore stands in no need of help from the Indian community.
('6', 342, 6, 19, 644601) But the above instance should make us realize that the Indian community cannot give its consent to such proposals.
('6', 342, 6, 20, 644716) If need be, it can even register its opposition.
('6', 342, 6, 21, 644765) We hear that the climate of Lobito Bay is pleasant.
('6', 342, 6, 22, 644817) It is therefore probable that the Indian labourers will be happy there.
('6', 342, 6, 23, 644889) Much will depend upon whether the foremen who will accompany them are good men or not.

('6', 343, 2, 3, 645085) ASIATIC ORDINANCE
('6', 343, 3, 4, 645103) In just two days the new Transvaal parliament passed the Ordinance exactly as it stood in September last.
('6', 343, 3, 5, 645209) On the 20th the Ordinance was introduced in the Assembly, and the same day, within two hours, it went through all the three readings and was immediately sent to the Legislative Council, where, at the instance of Mr. Martin, it was postponed to the 22nd so that Members could have time to study it.
('6', 343, 3, 6, 645507) 1 But this was merely a pretence.
('6', 343, 3, 7, 645541) How were the Members to digest it in one night?
('6', 343, 3, 8, 645589) The Legislative Council passed it on the 22nd.
('6', 343, 4, 9, 645636) TELEGRAM FROM ASSOCIATION
('6', 343, 5, 10, 645662) No one ever dreamt that the Bill would be passed in this manner.
('6', 343, 5, 11, 645727) When the Association came to know of it, it immediately sent a telegram to the Council to the following effect:
('6', 343, 6, 12, 645839) The Association finds with great sorrow that the Asiatic Bill has already been passed in the Assembly and is likely to pass through the Council today.
('6', 343, 6, 13, 645990) The Association humbly requests that, until the Associations plea in the matter has been heard, further consideration of the Bill may be postponed.
('6', 343, 6, 14, 646138) The Association begs to remind Your Honour that the function of the Council is to protect the interests of those who do not have the franchise.
('6', 343, 6, 15, 646282) The Indian community is loyal, but is without the right to vote.
('6', 343, 6, 16, 646347) The Association does not at all admit the charge that there is a mass infiltration into the Transvaal by Indians.
('6', 343, 6, 17, 646461) All adult Indians possess permits bearing names and identification marks.
('6', 343, 6, 18, 646535) Those who are without permits can even now be deported.
('6', 343, 6, 19, 646591) It is our request that at the least a commission should be appointed to inquire into the allegation.
('6', 343, 6, 20, 646692) We feel that the Bill is oppressive and uncalled for.
('6', 343, 6, 21, 646746) The Association requests redress at the hands of the Council.
('6', 343, 7, 22, 646808) This telegram was read out before the Council, but without any result.
('6', 343, 7, 23, 646879) Now the Bill has been sent to Lord Elgin for approval.
('6', 343, 8, 24, 646934) Satyagraha in South Africa, Ch. XV where Gandhiji says that the Bill was rushed through all its stages in a single sitting on March 21, 1907.

('6', 344, 1, 2, 647120) SPEECHES ON BILL
('6', 344, 2, 3, 647137) The Colonial Secretary, Mr. Smuts, said that the whole white population of the Transvaal was of one mind in the matter.
('6', 344, 2, 4, 647257) Indians should be stopped from coming in.
('6', 344, 2, 5, 647299) They come in in large numbers.
('6', 344, 2, 6, 647330) The Dutch Government attempted to prevent them, and this led to the [Boer] War.
('6', 344, 2, 7, 647410) The Bill that had been presented that day had come up before the former Council.
('6', 344, 2, 8, 647491) Its aim was just to have every Indian registered.
('6', 344, 2, 9, 647541) Law 3 of 1885 was defective, and its drawbacks would be removed in the new Bill.
('6', 344, 2, 10, 647622) The Imperial Government had vetoed the Bill because it was passed by the former Council.
('6', 344, 2, 11, 647711) They were now in a position to show that they were unanimous in passing it.
('6', 344, 2, 12, 647787) Further legislation would be necessary after that Bill had become law; but they would have to look into the matter later.
('6', 344, 2, 13, 647909) For the time being it was necessary for them to know who had the right to live in the Colony.
('6', 344, 2, 14, 648003) For these reasons the Bill must be passed the very same day.
('6', 344, 2, 15, 648064) Dr. Krautze supported the motion.
('6', 344, 2, 16, 648098) Mr. Owen Jones said that all the municipalities demanded such an Act.
('6', 344, 2, 17, 648168) It was absolutely essential to protect the whites.
('6', 344, 2, 18, 648219) Mr. Loveday congratulated the Government on its promptness in bringing up the Bill.
('6', 344, 2, 19, 648303) Mr. Jacobs said that all farmers wanted the Indians driven out.
('6', 344, 2, 20, 648367) If the Indians were not sent back, they might even dispossess the farmers.
('6', 344, 2, 21, 648442) The whites could settle in the Transvaal, but not in India.
('6', 344, 2, 22, 648502) The Indians should not therefore leave their own country.
('6', 344, 2, 23, 648560) General Choke Burger supported the Bill and so did Sir Percy Fitzpatrick.
('6', 344, 2, 24, 648634) The Bill was thus passed, and then sent up to the Council.
('6', 344, 3, 25, 648693) IN THE COUNCIL
('6', 344, 4, 26, 648708) Mr. Curtis said that the Bill must be passed, but that the Council should have a night to consider it, lest anyone in England should think that the Council passed it without due consideration.
('6', 344, 4, 27, 648901) The Bill was absolutely necessary.
('6', 344, 4, 28, 648936) From his experience he could say that every month a hundred Indians entered the Transvaal without permits.
('6', 344, 4, 29, 649043) If, therefore, South Africa was to remain in the hands of the whites, the Bill had to be passed.
('6', 344, 4, 30, 649140) Mr. Martin said that traders and all others had asked for such a Bill and that it should be passed.
('6', 344, 4, 31, 649240) Mr. Roy congratulated [the Government] on bringing forward the Bill.
('6', 344, 4, 32, 649309) Mr. Purchas said that the Bill was reasonable and that the Indian contention was not fair.
('6', 345, 0, 1, 649400) 346 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 345, 1, 2, 649442) Indians were concerned only with their own interests.
('6', 345, 1, 3, 649496) They did not consider the other side and their English friends were unaware of conditions here.
('6', 345, 2, 4, 649592) PRESS COMMENTS
('6', 345, 3, 5, 649607) The Leader, The Daily Mail and The Star make the following comments.
('6', 345, 3, 6, 649676) According to The Leader, Lord Elgin had now no alternative but to give his approval to the Bill.
('6', 345, 3, 7, 649773) However, in vetoing the former Bill, he had raised a big issue.
('6', 345, 3, 8, 649837) It was difficult to see how he could now approve the present Bill.
('6', 345, 3, 9, 649904) In the opinion of The Rand Daily Mail, the Bill was necessary to prevent Indian infiltration.
('6', 345, 3, 10, 649998) It was well therefore that it had been passed.
('6', 345, 3, 11, 650045) Those who remained in the Transvaal, however, should be able to live a decent life.
('6', 345, 3, 12, 650129) The Star says that Sir Richard Solomon had brought the news that the Bill would receive Royal assent in it was passed by the new parliament.
('6', 345, 3, 13, 650270) The Bill must therefore be passed now.
('6', 345, 4, 14, 650309) COMMENTS IN ENGLAND
('6', 345, 5, 15, 650329) The Times says that the Transvaal parliament has made a serious mistake in passing the Bill.
('6', 345, 5, 16, 650422) It did not think of the difficulties of the Imperial Government.
('6', 345, 5, 17, 650487) The Conservative Globe also says that the Bill should not be approved.
('6', 345, 5, 18, 650558) The Tribune thinks that it was improper that the Bill should have been passed.
('6', 345, 5, 19, 650637) But now that General Botha was visiting England, Lord Elgin should be able to find a way out.
('6', 345, 6, 20, 650731) OUR COMMITTEE VIGILANT
('6', 345, 7, 21, 650754) Cables from England show that our Committee there has started a movement in Parliament against the Bill.
('6', 345, 7, 22, 650859) Furthermore, a joint meeting of the Committee and the East India Association will take place at Caxton Hall on April 9.
('6', 345, 8, 23, 650979) ASSOCIATION MEETING
('6', 345, 9, 24, 650999) A joint meeting of the British Indian Association and the Anti Indian Law Fund Committee took place last Sunday at Mr. Coovadias residence.
('6', 345, 9, 25, 651139) It was followed by another meeting of the Hamidia Islamic Society on Monday.
('6', 345, 9, 26, 651216) At both the meetings, it was solemnly resolved after due consideration to adhere to the Resolution
('6', 346, 0, 1, 651315) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 347
('6', 346, 1, 2, 651359) about going to gaol.
('6', 346, 1, 3, 651380) Haji Habib, Secretary of the Pretoria Committee, was present at both the meetings.
('6', 346, 1, 4, 651463) At this meeting a cheque for the money raised for the struggle against the anti Indian law, which had been so far with the Gujarati Hindu Society, was received as also another for the money that was lying with Mr. Alibhai Akuji.
('6', 346, 1, 5, 651692) Attempts are now being made to recover the money collected by other persons.
('6', 346, 2, 6, 651769) NEED FOR FUNDS
('6', 346, 3, 7, 651784) Every one can understand that at such a time the need for funds will be great.
('6', 346, 3, 8, 651863) A long discussion took place at both the meetings on the money which had not yet been received from the mofussil committees.
('6', 346, 3, 9, 651988) They should remit these amounts immediately.
('6', 346, 4, 10, 652033) MASS MEETING
('6', 346, 5, 11, 652046) It has been decided to hold a mass meeting on Friday, the 30th 1. Notices have been sent out to all the places.

('6', 347, 12, 12, 653209) As I am sending a separate report 2 of the big mass meeting, it is unnecessary to say anything about it here.
('6', 347, 12, 13, 653319) One cannot visualize what the outcome of the meeting will be.
('6', 347, 12, 14, 653381) A report of it has been cabled to England through Reuter at half rates and cost over 21. The 440 word cable has gone to all the papers in England.
('6', 347, 12, 15, 653528) Another has been sent to the South Africa British Indian Committee.
('6', 347, 13, 16, 653596) The Colonial Secretary has been informed about the meeting, and the Association has sought an appointment for a deputation to meet him.
('6', 347, 13, 17, 653732) The idea is to place all the resolutions before the Colonial Secretary and to persuade him to agree to the proposal contained in the Second Resolution.
('6', 347, 14, 18, 653884) Mr. Smuts has refused to forward to Lord Elgin the telegram sent to him.
('6', 347, 14, 19, 653957) He adds that the Colonial Secretary will not object to the Association sending the telegram directly to Lord Elgin if it so desires.

('6', 348, 8, 11, 654986) 322. A WAY OUT OF DIFFICULTY
('6', 348, 9, 12, 655015) The Indian Mass Meeting, held the other day at Johannesburg, shows the earnestness with which British Indians in the Transvaal are fighting an uphill battle.
('6', 348, 9, 13, 655173) The central point of the proceedings was undoubtedly the Second Resolution, which embodied the eminently reasonable suggestion made by Mr. Abdool Gani, the Chairman of the Meeting and President of the British Indian Association.
('6', 348, 9, 14, 655402) If the Transvaal Government have any desire whatsoever to conciliate British Indians and to look at the situation from all points of view, they will accept the proposal without the slightest hesitation.
('6', 348, 9, 15, 655605) With statesmanlike moderation, British Indians have offered voluntarily to be re registered; they have offered to exchange the double documents they now hold for another document to be mutually approved; and although there is no legislative compulsion, they have agreed to submit to certain restrictions which the Government have considered to be necessary.
('6', 348, 9, 16, 655963) The Second Resolution is at once an earnest of the bona fides of the Indian community, and a way out of a delicate and difficult position.
('6', 348, 9, 17, 656102) We should be very much surprised if it were not a fact that the Transvaal Ministry is not pining for a tussle with the Imperial Government.
('6', 348, 9, 18, 656242) It should be thankful to take up the Indian suggestions, nor need Indians be at all frightened over the Resolution.
('6', 349, 0, 1, 656358) 350 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 349, 1, 2, 656400) Whilst it undoubtedly exposes them once more to irksome procedure, in view of the prejudice existing in the Colony, it is necessary for them to undergo it.
('6', 349, 1, 3, 656556) The step taken voluntarily will redound to the eternal credit of the community, and it will pave the way for a reasonable settlement of the whole Indian question.
('6', 349, 1, 4, 656719) Moreover, the more the Indian community yields in a dignified manner, the more secure becomes its position in the event of the obnoxious Bill receiving the Royal sanction, and it being necessary for the community to enforce the Fourth Resolution of last September.
('6', 349, 1, 5, 656984) The Natal Advertiser has taken us to task for, as it terms it, deliberately inciting the Transvaal British Indians to passive resistance.
('6', 349, 1, 6, 657122) It is impossible for The Advertiser to enter into the feelings that actuate British Indians.
('6', 349, 1, 7, 657215) It is not a question of martyrdom, nor is it a question of offering resistance for the sake of it.
('6', 349, 1, 8, 657314) We have no hesitation in saying that to a loyal and law abiding community, passive resistance, as the proposed going to gaol has been termed for want of a better word, is a recognized method of obtaining redress; as a matter of fact, the going to gaol is a legal method of submission to law.
('6', 349, 1, 9, 657606) There are four things provided in the Bill: one is to submit to registration; secondly in its absence, to leave the country; thirdly, in the absence of either, to pay a fine if the option is reserved; lastly and fourthly, in the absence of any of the last three, to suffer imprisonment.
('6', 349, 1, 10, 657893) We cannot conceive that there is anything wrong for a British Indian to accept the last remedy, if he considers that registration is worse than gaol.
('6', 349, 1, 11, 658043) It is undoubtedly true that the last method is an extreme step justifiable under exceptional circumstances.
('6', 349, 1, 12, 658151) Whether or not a particular state creates such circumstances is a matter of opinion, and the prudence of a community is measured by its capacity for finding out the real state operating to justify that method.
('6', 349, 1, 13, 658361) If, then, all the moderate propositions submitted by the British Indians in the Transvaal fail to carry weight, and if the Imperial Government abdicate their function of protecting the weak against the strong, we re affirm our opinion that for the Indian community to be considered a self respecting body, no other course is left open, but with quiet courage and resignation, to prefer gaol to submission to the insult offered by the Bill.

('6', 350, 1, 2, 658870) 323. SUGGESTION TO OUR TRANSVAAL READERS
('6', 350, 2, 3, 658911) This number of Indian Opinion is in our view a very important one.
('6', 350, 2, 4, 658978) It carries a report of the Transvaal meeting 1 which every one should read carefully.
('6', 350, 2, 5, 659064) But it is especially necessary to get as many whites as possible to read the English report and to draw their attention to the Second Resolution in particular.
('6', 350, 2, 6, 659224) If they read it in the right spirit, we are sure they will support the suggestion contained therein.
('6', 350, 2, 7, 659325) If this should happen, the Bill would not come into force.
('6', 350, 2, 8, 659384) We therefore suggest that each reader order as many copies of this number as possible and distribute them among the whites and request them to read it.
('6', 350, 2, 9, 659536) In the belief that this hope of ours will be realized, we have printed extra copies of this number.
('6', 350, 2, 10, 659636) Copies may be had from the head office or from our Johannesburg office.
('6', 350, 2, 11, 659708) A four penny stamp for each copy may be sent with the order.
('6', 350, 2, 12, 659769) Merely to pass on a copy to a white without any explanation would be like throwing it away.
('6', 350, 2, 13, 659861) It would also be necessary to explain which portion he should read.

('6', 350, 6, 17, 659999) Hundreds of Transvaal Indians met in Johannesburg on the 29th and passed a number of resolutions.
('6', 350, 6, 18, 660097) The function went off smoothly without any untoward incident, for which the British Indian Association deserves to be congratulated.
('6', 350, 6, 19, 660230) The situation at present is not such that, once the meetings are over, we can lapse into inactivity.
('6', 350, 6, 20, 660331) It is the duty of every Indian to put up sustained resistance.
('6', 350, 6, 21, 660394) We should bear in mind that the question does not concern the Transvaal alone.
('6', 350, 6, 22, 660473) Let us think about what we should do if the Bill were passed.
('6', 350, 6, 23, 660535) No one should presume that, because this mass meeting did not pass a resolution about going to gaol, the idea has been abandoned.
('6', 350, 6, 24, 660665) We have no other remedy left except going to gaol and, if the Indian community adheres to this resolve, it may bring in benefits all round.

('6', 351, 1, 2, 660971) If the Ordinance is passed, Indians must hold meetings in every town and village and inform the Government that they would rather go to gaol than take out passes.
('6', 351, 1, 3, 661134) We believe it would be wise to start preparing for such an eventuality from now on.
('6', 351, 1, 4, 661218) So, if those who are prepared to go to gaol will let us have their names and addresses, we will publish them in this journal.
('6', 351, 1, 5, 661344) It is necessary to do this; for each will derive strength from the other and even the Government will be unnerved by the publication of the names.
('6', 351, 1, 6, 661491) We propose to publish these names in the English section also.
('6', 351, 1, 7, 661554) We have already explained to the Natal and Cape Indians their duties in this context.
('6', 351, 1, 8, 661640) 1 They should immediately hold meetings and pass resolutions of sympathy and send these to [the authorities in] England.

('6', 351, 5, 13, 661885) The poor applicant was given the licence only after he had cancelled the deed of partnership.
('6', 351, 5, 14, 661979) This is not justice.
('6', 351, 5, 15, 662000) Today the appeal court demands this; tomorrow it may demand more.
('6', 351, 5, 16, 662066) A licence can be had only after meeting the demands of the court [whatever they are].
('6', 351, 5, 17, 662152) This is possible only because the Board has excessive powers.
('6', 351, 5, 18, 662214) It is quite clear from the Harding case that an even bigger struggle against the Natal Licensing Act is necessary.

('6', 351, 10, 23, 662422) A huge meeting of Indians was held at the Gaiety Theatre in Johannesburg on March 29 to protest against the Asiatic Act and pass the necessary resolutions.
('6', 351, 10, 24, 662578) It was attended by delegates from

('6', 352, 1, 3, 662724) Many people had to go back as the Theatre was filled to capacity.
('6', 352, 1, 4, 662790) The President of the British Indian Association, Mr. Abdul Gani, was in the chair.
('6', 352, 1, 5, 662873) On the platform were Mr. Haji Habib, Mr. Vyas, and others from Pretoria; Mr. Abdul Rehman Moti, Mr.Joosab Haji Vali, Mr. Mohanlal Khanderia from Pietersburg; Mr. Reshavji Giga from Spelonkin; Mr. A. M. Bhayat and Mr. Somabhai from Heidelberg; Mr. Ismail Kaji, Mr. Vaja and Mr. khurshedji from Krugersdorp; and Mr. Khan from Zeerust.

Bobat of Potchefstroom, Mr. V. Appasami, Pandit Ramsundar, Mr. Lal Bahadur Singh, Mr. Dadlani, Mr. Gandhi and others were also present.
('6', 352, 1, 7, 663777) Telegrams and letters came in from many places.
('6', 352, 1, 8, 663825) The reporters of The Star and The Rand Daily Mail were present.
('6', 352, 1, 9, 663889) The meeting began at 4 p.m.
('6', 352, 1, 10, 663917) A translation of Mr. Abdul Ganis speech is given below:
('6', 352, 2, 11, 663973) WELCOME
('6', 352, 3, 12, 663981) It has fallen to me once again to welcome the Indians from Johannesburg and the delegates who have come to participate in the deliberations over important questions concerning our community.
('6', 352, 3, 13, 664172) The act which was rejected by Lord Elgin has been passed again by the new parliament.
('6', 352, 3, 14, 664258) Fortunately we were not under any illusion when we welcomed our Delegates on their return from England with the victory they had won.
('6', 352, 3, 15, 664392) We knew then that our work had just begun.
('6', 352, 3, 16, 664435) However, none of us had any suspicion at the time that the same law would be re enacted within 24 hours and that normal parliamentary procedure would be suspended for the purpose.
('6', 352, 3, 17, 664615) 1 Suspension of parliamentary procedure is nothing surprising; but it is done only in a great emergency.

('6', 353, 1, 2, 664801) HOW BILL CAME TO BE PASSED
('6', 353, 2, 3, 664828) If a state of real emergency had arisen and the country had to be saved, we could understand the rushing of a law through parliament; but on this occasion it was merely a fight between the lion and the goat.
('6', 353, 3, 4, 665036) WHITE AND BROWN
('6', 353, 4, 5, 665052) While, on the one hand, there are 250,000 whites who enjoy all political rights and the number goes on increasing monthly because they can enter without restriction, there are, on the other hand, 14,000 Indians whose number, it is said, increases by a hundred a month.
('6', 353, 4, 6, 665321) It is in order to protect the all powerful whites that the Act to keep out Indians without a permit has been passed.
('6', 353, 4, 7, 665438) People who do such a thing must be steeped in ill will against us.
('6', 353, 4, 8, 665505) Normally, the Act would have been placed before the public for consideration for three months and the champions of the Act, which is to protect the rights of 250,000 whites, would have had to run the risk only of 300 Indians entering the Transvaal.
('6', 353, 5, 9, 665754) HOW IS NEW LEGISLATURE?
('6', 353, 6, 10, 665778) It is deliberately that I describe our legislators as the custodians of the rights of the whites alone.
('6', 353, 6, 11, 665882) At any rate the members of the Council do nothing else.
('6', 353, 6, 12, 665938) It is said that the Legislative Council has been charged with the task of preventing the enactment of laws against the blacks.In fact, that this was their duty was urged as a reason when it was demanded that the Bill be postponed for the night.
('6', 353, 6, 13, 666183) But I must regretfully say that this was merely a ruse.
('6', 353, 6, 14, 666239) How could the members become familiar in a night with a bill, which was admittedly very important and complicated?
('6', 353, 6, 15, 666354) How could the Council gauge within a night the feelings and opinions of those whose rights it was supposed to protect?
('6', 353, 6, 16, 666473) Could the Council have passed the Bill as carelessly if the members had been elected by us?
('6', 353, 6, 17, 666565) Could it have ignored our humble demand that the Bill be postponed to enable us to place our case before it?
('6', 353, 6, 18, 666674) To prove that I am not making a mistake when I say this, I quote Mr. Curtis who is believed to be the author of this Bill.
('6', 353, 6, 19, 666797) He said, I am glad that this Bill has come up before the Council.
('6', 353, 6, 20, 666863) However, I support Mr. Martins motion to postpone consideration of it for a night.
('6', 353, 6, 21, 666946) If it is passed on the same day on which it is moved without
('6', 354, 0, 1, 667007) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 355
('6', 354, 1, 2, 667051) discussion in either of the Houses, we shall be placing a very big weapon in the hands of our opponents.
('6', 354, 1, 3, 667156) The Bill was rejected by Lord Elgin not because of its objects but because of some of its clauses.
('6', 354, 1, 4, 667255) How many members can claim that they have carefully read all the clauses of the Bill?
('6', 354, 1, 5, 667341) This Bill is an important and serious one.
('6', 354, 1, 6, 667384) It raises the question whether this land will continue to belong to the whites or become black.
('6', 354, 2, 7, 667480) DONT INDIANS THINK?
('6', 354, 3, 8, 667500) While casting his vote in favour of the Bill, Mr. Purchas said that we looked at only one side of the question.
('6', 354, 3, 9, 667612) We did not look to the interests of the whites.
('6', 354, 3, 10, 667660) He also said that our English friends did not know the conditions in the Colony.
('6', 354, 3, 11, 667741) In saying this Mr. Purchas has betrayed his ignorance of our case and of facts about our English friends.
('6', 354, 3, 12, 667847) For his information I repeat that we know the conditions [of life] of the whites and we want to adapt ourselves to their ideas.
('6', 354, 3, 13, 667975) That is why we have forgone our political rights and shown readiness to accept the law pertaining to trade and immigration without racial discrimination.
('6', 354, 3, 14, 668129) If anyone says that we accept it because we cannot help it, he will be quite wrong.
('6', 354, 3, 15, 668213) For had we wanted to do so, we could have fought against it, harassed both the Colonial and the India Offices and thus added to their worries.
('6', 354, 3, 16, 668356) I claim credit for our community for we realized our position without compulsion and did not harass the Imperial Government.
('6', 354, 3, 17, 668481) Again Mr. Purchas does not know our friends; for, if he did, he would find that many of our friends are renowned veteran Government servants.
('6', 354, 3, 18, 668623) They would never go over to any party without careful thought.
('6', 354, 3, 19, 668686) He who would accuse men like Sir William BuIl, Sir Lepel Griffin, and Sir Raymond West of partisanship surely does not know them.
('6', 354, 3, 20, 668816) It is needless to name the other famous Liberals.
('6', 354, 3, 21, 668866) It is thanks to them that [the Colony gained responsible government and] members are elected to the Council and the Assembly.
('6', 354, 3, 22, 668992) Their motive in trying to secure justice for Indians from the rulers of the Transvaal is the same as that which made them show such unexampled generosity towards the Transvaal whites.
('6', 354, 3, 23, 669176) Both according to them and to us, responsible government means the right to manage ones own affairs and not the right to tyrannize over others who do not have the vote.
('6', 354, 3, 24, 669345) The people of the Colony forget this definition of responsible government and disapprove of the restrictions in the constitution for safeguarding the rights of the
('6', 355, 0, 1, 669509) 356 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 355, 1, 2, 669551) blacks.
('6', 355, 1, 3, 669559) And that is why even men like Sir Richard Solomon say that these restrictions are only nominal.
('6', 355, 1, 4, 669655) This is our lot at the very beginning of responsible government.
('6', 355, 2, 5, 669720) LORD SELBORNE
('6', 355, 3, 6, 669734) Our freedom was endangered when the Colony won responsible government; similarly we now become nervous as we read Lord Selbornes despatches.
('6', 355, 3, 7, 669875) We had hoped that Lord Selborne, who, before the war, talked about our rights, would now, with better opportunities to do so, protect us the better.
('6', 355, 3, 8, 670024) But I must respectfully submit that, instead of working as a trustee, he has functioned as a partisan.
('6', 355, 3, 9, 670127) Instead of having equal regard for all, he has been partial to the whites.
('6', 355, 4, 10, 670202) BRIBERY IS RELIGION OF INDIANS
('6', 355, 5, 11, 670233) Let me comment on some matters mentioned in his communications which are published in the Blue book.
('6', 355, 5, 12, 670334) His Lordship, on being given information about false permits, levelled an unworthy and painful charge against us.
('6', 355, 5, 13, 670448) His Excellency said, Those who have come in contact with the people of the East know that they do not look upon getting their work done through bribery as irreligious.
('6', 355, 5, 14, 670616) Thanks to this state of affairs the permit inspector succumbs to temptation for which he should never be given the opportunity. I know nothing about the habit of offering bribes among the people of the East, but I do know that even the lowest among the Indians knows that offering a bribe is bad.
('6', 355, 5, 15, 670913) I must remind His Lordship that, in 1903, officials in the Asiatic Office at Johannesburg did accept bribes and that it was through the efforts of the British Indian Association that they were caught and dismissed.
('6', 355, 6, 16, 671128) IS BILL ADVANTAGEOUS TO INDIANS?
('6', 355, 7, 17, 671161) Lord Selborne says that the Bill is advantageous to the Indian community; but we have shown that this is not at all so.
('6', 355, 7, 18, 671281) His Lordship therefore accuses us of over reaching ourselves; but we can accuse him too of doing the same thing.
('6', 355, 7, 19, 671394) According to him, it is unfair of us to say that [under the Bill] our position becomes inferior to that of the Kaffirs.
('6', 355, 7, 20, 671514) I repeat what I said.
('6', 355, 7, 21, 671536) The Kaffirs do not have to take out a pass as we have to; neither have they to have their children registered.
('6', 356, 0, 1, 671647) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 357
('6', 356, 1, 2, 671691) CHARGE AGAINST SIR LEPEL
('6', 356, 2, 3, 671716) Moreover, His Lordship has levelled a charge against Sir Lepel Griffin also and has criticized him for his remarks on the taking out of passes by women and children.
('6', 356, 2, 4, 671882) But he has deliberately omitted the fact that Mr. Gandhi corrected Sir Lepels minor mistake on the spot.
('6', 356, 3, 5, 671987) And it is undoubtedly true that children will have to be registered.
('6', 356, 3, 6, 672056) It must also be noted that the Transvaal Government would have made registration compulsory for women also if they had had their own way.
('6', 356, 4, 7, 672194) DO MANY INDIANS ENTER WITHOUT PERMITS?
('6', 356, 5, 8, 672233) Many other matters arise from what Lord Selborne has written; but I cannot give an account of these here.
('6', 356, 5, 9, 672339) I must mention one fact however.
('6', 356, 5, 10, 672372) We can offer the same evidence to disprove Lord Selbornes contentionthat many people enter without a permitwhich he gives in order to show that they do.
('6', 356, 5, 11, 672525) For the same proven offences which he uses against us show that the existing system of permits is sufficient to catch holders of faked ones.
('6', 356, 5, 12, 672666) Those who have presented the facts before Lord Selborne have not differentiated between those who have already entered with false permits and settled here and others who now try to enter with such permits.
('6', 356, 5, 13, 672872) And in the charged atmosphere of the Transvaal a single instance of a faked permit appears magnified a hundred folds In his report of September 27, Mr. Chamney says that, during the last six months, 287 persons were found without permits or with false ones.
('6', 356, 5, 14, 673130) Of these 165 have been found guilty and 122 are in the Colony but cannot be traced.
('6', 356, 5, 15, 673214) Therefore, if Mr. Chamneys findings are correct, 21 persons, on an average, enter every month with faked permits or without a permit altogether.
('6', 356, 5, 16, 673359) Despite these facts, Mr. Curtis maintains that each month 100 Asiatics enter in this manner with faked permits.
('6', 356, 6, 17, 673471) WHAT ARE WE FIGHTING FOR?
('6', 356, 7, 18, 673497) Our fight is not against particular clauses of the Bill but against the entire Bill and its objectives.
('6', 356, 7, 19, 673601) It puts a dark blot on us; it outrages our feelings.
('6', 356, 7, 20, 673654) It presupposes that those to whom it applies are criminals.
('6', 356, 7, 21, 673714) This makes our position worse in relation to Kaffirs and Malays, with whom we daily come in contact,
('6', 356, 8, 22, 673815) 1 Vide Deputation to Lord Elgin, 8 11 1906.
('6', 357, 0, 1, 673859) 358 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 357, 1, 2, 673901) by marking us off from them in an objectionable manner.
('6', 357, 1, 3, 673957) Conse quently our status is depressed.
('6', 357, 1, 4, 673996) Admittedly it no more than wounds our susceptibilities; but such an affront cannot be put up with indefinitely.
('6', 357, 1, 5, 674108) One does not mind it much if ones feelings are hurt on rare occasions and in some trivial matter.
('6', 357, 1, 6, 674206) In fact, such things we suffer daily at the hands of the whites.
('6', 357, 1, 7, 674271) But when our feelings are hurt on important matters and we are made to look small all the time, it would be cowardice and betrayal of our country for us to endure it all silently.
('6', 357, 1, 8, 674451) We praise the whites because they think in terms of the future; but if we are sincere in our praise, we must emulate them.
('6', 357, 1, 9, 674574) When we think of our future, should they not congratulate us?
('6', 357, 1, 10, 674636) It is only right that they are ever active in defending their rights.
('6', 357, 1, 11, 674706) Cant we then exert ourselves to preserve ours?
('6', 357, 2, 12, 674753) WHAT DID WHITES SUFFER?
('6', 357, 3, 13, 674777) When President Kruger made it obligatory for the whites to take out passes, they were highly agitated.
('6', 357, 3, 14, 674880) All South Africa resounded with protests against the way the late President had, according to them, thought up a way of disgracing them.
('6', 357, 3, 15, 675017) In the end, the President had to give in, although the humiliation that we are being subjected to is far more serious than theirs.
('6', 357, 3, 16, 675148) Moreover there was a better reason for taking stringent measures against them, for they were attacking the state.
('6', 357, 3, 17, 675262) But we have never been accused of any action against states or society.
('6', 357, 3, 18, 675334) Even the annual report of the Transvaal [Government] states that our people never give the police any trouble.
('6', 357, 3, 19, 675445) In spite of this, a law has been passed, as I said before, in 24 hours as if we were great crimi nals, and it now only awaits the sanction of the Imperial Government.
('6', 357, 4, 20, 675612) INJURY ADDED TO INSULT
('6', 357, 5, 21, 675635) Again, we raise our objection against the law not merely because our feelings are wounded.
('6', 357, 5, 22, 675726) It will cause us great loss as well Our experience is that any law applicable only to a section of the people always causes much suffering.
('6', 357, 5, 23, 675866) It leads to other consequential enactments.
('6', 357, 5, 24, 675910) Other laws are framed on a similar basis.
('6', 357, 5, 25, 675952) I do grant, however, that no Bill can be more severe than this.
('6', 357, 5, 26, 676016) But that is no consolation.
('6', 357, 5, 27, 676044) I can give examples to show that, even where such class legislation was not so designed, it did cause much harm and hardship.
('6', 357, 5, 28, 676170) Never during the Boer regime was the Law [3] of 1885 enforced as harshly as it is today.
('6', 357, 5, 29, 676259) Sir Hercules Robinson (later Lord Rosemead) had in fact stipulated that this law would
('6', 358, 0, 1, 676346) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 359
('6', 358, 1, 2, 676390) not apply to respectable Indians such as traders.
('6', 358, 1, 3, 676440) But Lord Rosemeads view passed with him and the law was applied to us according to its literal interpretation.
('6', 358, 1, 4, 676551) The Bill confers such wide powers on the officials that if they were unsympathetic, it might lead to much harassment.
('6', 358, 2, 5, 676669) EXAMPLE OF NATAL
('6', 358, 3, 6, 676686) Even though the trading law applies both to the white and the black in Natal, it has become oppressive [to the latter].
('6', 358, 3, 7, 676806) For there is much divergence between its interpretation [now] and the promises made [at the time of its enactment].
('6', 358, 3, 8, 676922) The understanding was that the rights of old traders would not be infringed.
('6', 358, 3, 9, 676999) This has been thrown to the winds, and no Indian trader seems to be safe because of the way the law is now being enforced.
('6', 358, 3, 10, 677122) Such insecurity prevails in the Cape too.
('6', 358, 3, 11, 677164) We too were given promises when the war broke out, but we got nothing besides.
('6', 358, 3, 12, 677243) We must therefore realize that this Bill brings us to the brink of extinction.
('6', 358, 4, 13, 677322) IF THUMB IMPRESSION, WHY NOT TEN FINGER PRINTS?
('6', 358, 5, 14, 677370) We are being asked why, if we had willingly agreed to give the thumb impressions, should we now object to giving impressions of the ten digits under compulsion?
('6', 358, 5, 15, 677531) This question would suggest that the whole affair was merely one of the thumb or the fingers.
('6', 358, 5, 16, 677625) As a matter of fact, our struggle raises a very big issue.
('6', 358, 5, 17, 677684) Looking at it from another point of view, we find that we do many things willingly and feel no indignity in doing them.
('6', 358, 5, 18, 677804) But the same things we will not do under compulsion.
('6', 358, 5, 19, 677857) We look upon the law of compulsory registration as the sting of a scorpion.
('6', 358, 5, 20, 677933) But mere argument cannot make the whites understand [our point of view].
('6', 358, 5, 21, 678006) They have a suspicion that we wish to swamp the Colony with Indians.
('6', 358, 5, 22, 678075) Mr. Roy believes that, if we did entertain such a desire, it would be but natural.
('6', 358, 5, 23, 678158) But we deny this.
('6', 358, 5, 24, 678176) Mr. Smuts has said that the Bill has two objects.
('6', 358, 5, 25, 678226) One is to separate the Indians who have the right to stay from those who do not have the right.
('6', 358, 5, 26, 678322) The other is to give Indians, who are lawfully [in the Colony], permits which contain more details so as to enable [the Government] to detect those who enter the Transvaal in the future without a permit.
('6', 358, 5, 27, 678526) All this can be done very easily, quickly and inexpensivelywith the consent of the Indian communityby virtue of the laws that are already in force.
('6', 358, 5, 28, 678674) We have agreed to help the Government at all times.
('6', 358, 5, 29, 678726) I, therefore, put forward the following proposal today in your name so that the two objects mentioned by Mr. Smuts can be achieved without having to pass the new Bill.
('6', 359, 0, 1, 678894) 360 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 359, 1, 2, 678936) THE PROPOSAL
('6', 359, 2, 3, 678949) This was in fact done during Lord Milners time and both he and Captain Fowled were happy with the Indian community.
('6', 359, 2, 4, 679065) This is the proposal that I make: (1) The Governmnt should fix a day for the simultaneous examination of all the permits.
('6', 359, 3, 5, 679187) (2) Either all of them should be stamped with the seal of the Colonial Secretary or, where the existing permits are genuine, they should be replaced by new ones and their form and contents should be decided on in consultation with the Indian community.
('6', 359, 4, 6, 679440) (3) Instead of the two documents, a permit and a registration [certificate] that are taken out at present, only one should be issued to Indians.
('6', 359, 5, 7, 679585) (4) Permits should also be issued to boys and girls who have come of age.
('6', 359, 6, 8, 679659) (5) No Indian should get a trade licence if he does not produce his permit.
('6', 359, 7, 9, 679735) (6) The children of lawful Indian residents should also receive permits.
('6', 359, 8, 10, 679808) (7) Temporary permits should be issued only after a surety approved by the Colonial Secretary is produced.
('6', 359, 9, 11, 679915) These proposals, if accepted, would solve all problems.
('6', 359, 9, 12, 679971) It is undoubtedly true that the observance of some of the provisions will depend on the goodwill of the Indian community; for example, not getting a trade licence without first having a permit.
('6', 359, 9, 13, 680165) But in such matters we ask the Government to trust us.
('6', 359, 9, 14, 680220) Again this [state of affairs] will not last long, for the whole problem will have to be solved quickly.
('6', 359, 9, 15, 680324) Moreover, these problems are not covered by the registration law; other laws will be required to solve them.
('6', 359, 11, 16, 680433) In your name, I appeal to the Government to accept our proposals.
('6', 359, 11, 17, 680499) That will end their conflict with the Imperial Government.
('6', 359, 11, 18, 680558) We do not want to be always complaining to the Imperial Govern ment.
('6', 359, 11, 19, 680627) We want to live honourably in goodwill and amity with the whites under the aegis of the local Government and thus to respect
('6', 360, 0, 1, 680752) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 361
('6', 360, 1, 2, 680796) the wishes of the whites.
('6', 360, 1, 3, 680822) But all that can be done only if they regard us as human beings, grant that we have the same feelings that they have; that we are fit to enjoy the same rights as they under the great British Empire.
('6', 360, 1, 4, 681021) But if, unfortunately, this meeting cannot convince the Government of this unpalatable truth and of the justice of our demands, we shall have no alternative but to ask for the protection of the Imperial Govern ment, which it is bound to give.
('6', 360, 1, 5, 681264) Whenever the weak are oppressed by the strong, it is the duty of the Imperial Government to come to their help.
('6', 360, 1, 6, 681376) I draw the attention of this meeting to the resolutions passed by the [executive] Committee of the Association.
('6', 360, 1, 7, 681488) I thank you all for having attended this meeting.
('6', 360, 1, 8, 681538) May God help us.
('6', 360, 1, 9, 681555) May He give the officials the good sense to realize that our petition is just and to grant it in the belief that we have no strength save our truthfulness.
('6', 360, 1, 10, 681711) May they, at the beginning of their rule, give us hopes for the future!
('6', 360, 1, 11, 681783) (Applause.) The speech was read by Mr. Nanalal Shah in English.
('6', 360, 1, 12, 681847) Mr. Ally then moved the first resolution.
('6', 360, 2, 13, 681889) FIRST RESOLUTION
('6', 360, 3, 14, 681906) This meeting convened by the British Indian Association respectfully protests against the Asiatic Law Amendment Bill as being unnecessary and degrading to the Indian community.
('6', 360, 4, 15, 682083) [HAJI] OJER ALLY
('6', 360, 5, 16, 682100) I am happy to move this resolution.
('6', 360, 5, 17, 682136) I was a member of the Deputation that went to England.
('6', 360, 5, 18, 682191) The labours of the Deputation have been reduced to nought.
('6', 360, 5, 19, 682250) No one can say that we are not loyal subjects.
('6', 360, 5, 20, 682297) Though a law abiding people, we are oppressed.
('6', 360, 5, 21, 682344) We have not assembled here to defend those who enter with faked permits or with none.
('6', 360, 5, 22, 682430) Let the Government drive them out if they want to, but it is unjust to punish the genuine permit holders for theof Fences of the others.
('6', 360, 5, 23, 682567) It has been stated in the new parliament that the existing law is not enough to expel the offending Indians.
('6', 360, 5, 24, 682676) But that is not true.
('6', 360, 5, 25, 682698) Let the Government, if they like, enact a law that no one without a permit can carry on trade or hawking or take up employment.
('6', 360, 5, 26, 682826) If this is done, how can any Indian live on in the Transvaal without a permit?
('6', 360, 5, 27, 682905) When the Deputation was in England, a petition was sent [from here] to say that the members of the Deputation did not represent the community as a whole.
('6', 360, 5, 28, 683059) There are Indians of all communities in

('6', 361, 1, 2, 683141) this meeting.
('6', 361, 1, 3, 683155) Delegates from all the towns are here.
('6', 361, 1, 4, 683194) If there is anyone here who is opposed to that Deputation, let him speak up.
('6', 361, 1, 5, 683271) Lord Selbornes tirade against us is undeserved.
('6', 361, 1, 6, 683319) It is really strange that the Bill which Lord Elgin had rejected should be re introduced.
('6', 361, 1, 7, 683409) The President has pointed out that the Bill was passed within 24 hours; but I say that it was passed within an hour and a half.
('6', 361, 1, 8, 683537) Would the British people lose their sense justice?
('6', 361, 1, 9, 683588) If so, let the Proclamation of Queen [Victoria] and King Edwards message be withdrawn.
('6', 361, 1, 10, 683675) If this Bill is passed,we shall be looked upon as criminals by the whole world.
('6', 361, 1, 11, 683755) It is shameful that Mr. Smuts should call us coolies.
('6', 361, 1, 12, 683809) When I was in England, I was made a member of the National Liberal Club.
('6', 361, 1, 13, 683882) Even the lords respected me.
('6', 361, 1, 14, 683911) If this Bill is passed, I will not stay in this land a moment longer.
('6', 361, 1, 15, 683981) Rather than pass such laws, the Government had better drive us out of the Colony.
('6', 361, 2, 16, 684063) ESSOP MIAN I support the resolution moved by Mr. Ally.
('6', 361, 2, 17, 684118) It is pleasing to find that we can get together at a critical time [like this].
('6', 361, 2, 18, 684198) I believe Lord Selborne has been ill disposed towards us from the outset.
('6', 361, 2, 19, 684272) He has always regarded us all as coolies and no better than locusts.
('6', 361, 2, 20, 684341) They fought the Boers on our behalf but have now handed the country back to them.
('6', 361, 2, 21, 684423) And the Boers have re enacted the law Will Lord Elgin now sign the same Bill which he once refused to sign?
('6', 361, 2, 22, 684531) We have to fight with all our strength.
('6', 361, 2, 23, 684571) There is goodwill for us in England, and we hope to obtain redress for our grievances there.
('6', 361, 2, 24, 684664) Let Mr. Chamney put his thumb impression on our permits if he likes.
('6', 361, 2, 25, 684733) Who will then be able to erase those thumb marks?
('6', 361, 2, 26, 684783) [sic] The fact that the Government does not even forward our telegram shows that we are not going to get justice here.
('6', 361, 2, 27, 684902) We can never accept such a law.
('6', 361, 3, 28, 684934) COOVADIA
('6', 361, 4, 29, 684943) I also support Mr. Allys resolution.
('6', 361, 4, 30, 684980) It is our duty to put up a struggle.
('6', 361, 4, 31, 685017) The Ordinance is obnoxious and I appeal to everyone to refuse to submit to it.
('6', 361, 5, 32, 685096) HAJI HABIB
('6', 361, 6, 33, 685107) I support this resolution.

('6', 362, 1, 2, 685332) promise he made to a handful of whites.
('6', 362, 1, 3, 685372) But does he not regret not having made good his promise to the Indian community before the war?
('6', 362, 1, 4, 685468) Which is more importanthis promise given to a handful of whites or the one given to the thirty crores of Indians?
('6', 362, 1, 5, 685582) Whose words are more importantthose of Lord Selborne or those of the late Queen Victoria and King Emperor Edward?
('6', 362, 1, 6, 685696) The whites say that this country belongs exclusively to them.
('6', 362, 1, 7, 685758) Let us think this over.
('6', 362, 1, 8, 685782) There are [in the Colony] nearly a hundred thousand Indians, 1 five million Kaffirs and the rest Malays and Gape Boys.
('6', 362, 1, 9, 685901) Only when these people are all banished from the country can this be called a white mans land.
('6', 362, 1, 10, 685996) Let them send the Kaffirs away to Abyssinia, the Indians to India, the Chinese to China, the Malays to their native land and the Cape Boys to St. Helena.
('6', 362, 1, 11, 686150) Then, certainly, this will become the land of the whites.
('6', 362, 1, 12, 686208) Then we shall see how the affairs of the country are managed.
('6', 362, 1, 13, 686270) We shall always need three things to put up a fight against this law or any other fight for that matter: those who will fight, and the means to fight, that is, money and unity.
('6', 362, 1, 14, 686447) The first we already have; the second we can procure; the third, unity, we lack.
('6', 362, 1, 15, 686528) That we must bring about any how.
('6', 362, 2, 16, 686562) JUSAB HAJI VALI
('6', 362, 3, 17, 686578) Are we supposed to be thieves or free booters that even a Kaffir policeman can accost and detain us wherever we happen to be going?
('6', 362, 3, 18, 686710) We have begged them [for our rights] for long.
('6', 362, 3, 19, 686757) We can no longer trust the word of the whites.
('6', 362, 3, 20, 686804) We will continue to fight by constitutional means.
('6', 362, 3, 21, 686855) But self help is necessary.
('6', 362, 3, 22, 686883) To save the country from degradation, it is necessary for us to educate ourselves.
('6', 362, 4, 23, 686966) RAMSUNDAR PANDIT The mother gives her child milk, but a step mother eats him up.
('6', 362, 4, 24, 687047) The Government is like a step mother.
('6', 362, 4, 25, 687085) The Grand Old Man of India, Dadabhai Naoroji, spent a lifetime in trying to get redress for Indian grievances but that redress has not been obtained.
('6', 362, 4, 26, 687235) We should follow the example of Japan and unite, become industrious and educate ourselves.

('6', 363, 1, 3, 687550) In England women go to gaol in defence of their rights; how can we men be afraid of doing so?
('6', 363, 1, 4, 687644) What does it matter if we have to die for our motherland?
('6', 363, 1, 5, 687702) We should follow the example of great men like Babu Surendranath Banerjea.
('6', 363, 1, 6, 687777) I think it is better to return to India than to live on here in humiliation.
('6', 363, 2, 7, 687854) Messrs Vaza, Khurshedji, M. V. Naidu and K. N. Dadlani also supported the resolution and it was then passed unanimously.
('6', 363, 3, 8, 687975) SECOND RESOLUTION
('6', 363, 4, 9, 687993) This meeting convened under the auspices of the British Indian Association denies the allegation of illegal influx of Indians on a wholesale scale into the Transvaal, and, in order to satisfy the Govern ment and the people, offers to submit to voluntary re registration as was done by the community during Lord Milners| time and in the manner indicated in the chairmans speech thus fulfilling practically all the requirements of the Bill without its offensive character.
('6', 363, 5, 10, 688464) ABDUL REHMAN
('6', 363, 6, 11, 688477) I move this resolution.
('6', 363, 6, 12, 688501) I do not understand it fully.
('6', 363, 6, 13, 688531) But I consider myself bound to follow the Association.
('6', 363, 6, 14, 688586) There is no chance of securing any relief from the Dutch Government.
('6', 363, 6, 15, 688655) Mr. Smuts has pointed out that the war was fought on our account; this means that we can expect nothing favourable from the Dutch Government.
('6', 363, 6, 16, 688797) As to Lord Selborne, why should he do us a good turn?
('6', 363, 7, 17, 688851) Mr. Rees has left our Committee 1 saying that Lord Selbornes despatch is unanswerable.
('6', 363, 7, 18, 688938) But our chairman has given a very appropriate reply to it.
('6', 363, 7, 19, 688997) We do not have even the vote.
('6', 363, 7, 20, 689027) We have a lot to learn from the Dutch.
('6', 363, 7, 21, 689066) They are courageous and that is why they have got their kingdom back.
('6', 363, 7, 22, 689136) Shall we give in?
('6', 363, 7, 23, 689154) It is better to go to gaol than submit to this law.
('6', 363, 8, 24, 689206) Messrs Ibrahim Gata, M. P. Fancy, S. D. Bobat, Abdul Rehman Moti, Mohanlal Khanderia, T. Naidu and V. Appasami supported the resolution and it was passed unanimously.

('6', 364, 1, 2, 689468) THIRD RESOLUTION
('6', 364, 2, 3, 689485) In the event of the humble request embodied in the Second Resolution not being accepted by the local Government, this meeting requests full Imperial protection by reason of the fact that the Indian community has no voice in electing the government [of this country] and is a very small and weak community.
('6', 364, 3, 4, 689791) NADIRSHAH CAMA I move this resolution.
('6', 364, 3, 5, 689830) We must understand the nature of this law.
('6', 364, 3, 6, 689873) It is very humiliating.
('6', 364, 3, 7, 689897) We wish to live in peace and amity with the whites, but we will not be their slaves.
('6', 364, 3, 8, 689982) Let those who have entered by fraudulent means be driven out.
('6', 364, 3, 9, 690044) If all of us hold together, no harm will come to us.
('6', 364, 3, 10, 690097) We demand no political rights.
('6', 364, 3, 11, 690128) We have changed our permits several times.
('6', 364, 3, 12, 690171) We gave thumb impressions on Lord Milners advice.
('6', 364, 3, 13, 690221) During President Krugers lifetime Lord Selborne was our trustee.
('6', 364, 3, 14, 690286) After the Presidents death Lord Selborne has become another Kruger.
('6', 364, 3, 15, 690354) This law is not meant for the Hottentots or Kaffirs; why then should it apply only to us?
('6', 364, 3, 16, 690444) I believe that though my skin is black, my heart is whiter than any whites.
('6', 364, 3, 17, 690520) Our Committee is fighting for us in England and our Delegates have returned victorious.
('6', 364, 3, 18, 690608) We need not, therefore, lose heart.
('6', 364, 3, 19, 690644) Whatever may happen, we will never accept this law.
('6', 364, 3, 20, 690696) It will degrade us in the eyes of the whole world.
('6', 364, 3, 21, 690747) Does Mr. Smuts want to wreak vengeance on us for the war?
('6', 364, 3, 22, 690805) We have many difficulties to face.
('6', 364, 3, 23, 690840) Even if the Imperial Government gives its sanction to the law, I will never accept it.
('6', 364, 4, 24, 690927) E. M. ASWAT
('6', 364, 5, 25, 690939) The Act was enacted by the British; and now the Dutch are ruling.
('6', 364, 5, 26, 691005) But they are not to be blamed.
('6', 364, 5, 27, 691036) If a dog is hit by a stone, he bites the person who threw the stone at him, not the stone.
('6', 364, 5, 28, 691127) We shall not eat the Boer Governments land.
('6', 364, 5, 29, 691171) It was the locusts which ate up the crop.
('6', 364, 5, 30, 691213) I will not accept this law.
('6', 364, 7, 31, 691241) This law has a sting like that of a snake.
('6', 364, 7, 32, 691284) If King Emperor Edward does not give us justice, darkness will descend everywhere.
('6', 364, 7, 33, 691367) Why must we be classed with all other Asiatics?

('6', 365, 3, 4, 691558) The resolution embodying the appeal is an obsequious one.
('6', 365, 3, 5, 691616) But so let it be.
('6', 365, 3, 6, 691634) I would remind you all of the resolution we passed last September at the Empire Theatre.
('6', 365, 3, 7, 691723) That theatre has been gutted by a fire, but the words spoken there live on.
('6', 365, 3, 8, 691799) If, in accordance with those words, you cannot go to gaol, you may leave the country, but do not accept slavery by taking out passes according to this law.
('6', 365, 3, 9, 691955) I was present at the Benares Congress.
('6', 365, 3, 10, 691994) At that time Lala Lajpat Rai described how the Bengalis had acted like lions.
('6', 365, 3, 11, 692072) We too have to act likewise.
('6', 365, 3, 12, 692101) This resolution was supported by Messrs E. M. Patel, A. Desai, Omerji Sale, Ahmed Mahomed and A. A. Pillay and was passed unanimously.
('6', 365, 4, 13, 692236) FOURTH RESOLUTION
('6', 365, 5, 14, 692254) This meeting authorizes the chairman to submit these resolutions by cable to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the Secretary of State for India and the Viceroy of India.
('6', 365, 6, 15, 692431) IMAM ABDUL KADIR
('6', 365, 7, 16, 692448) Freedom is the supreme thing; the spread of Islam was made possible by freedom.
('6', 365, 7, 17, 692528) The British Government fought for the eradication of slavery in Zanzibar.
('6', 365, 7, 18, 692602) Will that Government now force slavery upon us here?
('6', 365, 7, 19, 692655) Lord Selborne has accused us of bribery.
('6', 365, 7, 20, 692696) If the European official had done justice without taking bribes who would have offered him bribes?
('6', 365, 7, 21, 692795) I shall never accept the imposition of slavery by those who have been sent here as [our] trustees by the Imperial Government.
('6', 365, 8, 22, 692921) OSMAN LATIEF For a long time now, we have held meetings about this.
('6', 365, 8, 23, 692989) We must have courage.
('6', 365, 8, 24, 693011) We are being blamed for the poverty of the Transvaal whites.
('6', 365, 8, 25, 693072) But what about the whites in the Orange Rear Colony who go on declaring themselves insolvent?
('6', 365, 8, 26, 693166) Surely, there are no Indians there.
('6', 365, 8, 27, 693202) We have got ourselves registered several times over; shall we go on doing so endlessly?
('6', 365, 8, 28, 693290) The whites admit that, when their forefathers were still barbarians, ours were
('6', 366, 0, 1, 693369) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 367
('6', 366, 1, 2, 693413) civilized.
('6', 366, 1, 3, 693424) How then can we, their descendants, bear this law?
('6', 366, 2, 4, 693475) MANIBHAI KHANDUBHAI
('6', 366, 3, 5, 693495) In this world, anything else can be conquered; but the mind of man is unconquerable.
('6', 366, 3, 6, 693580) Whatever the sufferings we have to undergo, we must oppose this law.
('6', 366, 3, 7, 693649) As for myself I will never accept it.
('6', 366, 4, 8, 693687) Mr. Bomanshah and Mr. Bapu Desai also supported the resolution, and it was passed unanimously.
('6', 366, 5, 9, 693782) MEANING OF SECOND RESOLUTION
('6', 366, 6, 10, 693811) Mr. Abdul Rehman had said that many people did not understand the Second Resolution; they felt that there was no difference between it and the Bill itself.
('6', 366, 6, 11, 693967) Replying to this Mr. Gandhi said:
('6', 366, 7, 12, 694001) It is after serious consideration by the leaders, and with their approval, that the Second Resolution is placed before the meeting.
('6', 366, 7, 13, 694133) Nevertheless, I take upon myself all responsibility for it.
('6', 366, 7, 14, 694193) I feel that the success of our Deputation to England was due solely to the fact that we had earlier taken out fresh permits and registers on Lord Milners advice.
('6', 366, 7, 15, 694355) If we had obstinately held out at that time, our plight would have become worse.
('6', 366, 7, 16, 694436) Lord Milner has written a letter to The Times in our favour.
('6', 366, 7, 17, 694497) That is, I think, because he understood the facts put before him by the Deputation.
('6', 366, 7, 18, 694581) For our part, just as we demand our rights vigorously and deny accusations against us where they are false, so should we admit our faults when we realize them.
('6', 366, 7, 19, 694741) Illegal entry by Indians is not as extensive as the whites allege.
('6', 366, 7, 20, 694808) We must nevertheless confess that some Indians do enter in this manner.
('6', 366, 7, 21, 694880) The more this happens the more severe will be the restrictions on us.
('6', 366, 7, 22, 694950) The Government argue that they cannot exercise an effective check [on illicit immigration] with the existing permits.
('6', 366, 7, 23, 695068) According to them, the thumb impressions on some are not clear, and a person sometimes sells his permit at one place and his register at another.
('6', 366, 7, 24, 695214) This is true to some extent; as a community, however, we do not accept this charge.
('6', 366, 7, 25, 695298) But the Government do not believe us.
('6', 366, 7, 26, 695336) It would only be right for us therefore to try to inspire confidence in them.
('6', 366, 7, 27, 695414) There would therefore be nothing wrong if we agreed to take out permits in the form acceptable to us, without the compulsion of law.
('6', 366, 7, 28, 695547) We therefore place the proposal before the Government that they give up the idea of
('6', 367, 0, 1, 695631) 368 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 367, 1, 2, 695673) passing the Act and we voluntarily take out fresh permits.
('6', 367, 1, 3, 695732) If it is accepted, it will do us credit; the Government will have faith in us; we may even be consulted in future when new legislation is contemplated, and above all the new Bill may be abandoned.
('6', 367, 1, 4, 695929) Anything voluntarily accepted by us cannot be regarded as humiliation.
('6', 367, 1, 5, 696000) Another outcome of our proposal will be that our humility, forbearance and good sense will be appreciated in England.
('6', 367, 1, 6, 696118) To prevent the passage of this Bill, there is, apart of course from gaol going, no better remedy than this.
('6', 367, 1, 7, 696226) Moreover, such [a system of] permits will be based on mutual understanding.
('6', 367, 1, 8, 696302) If therefore at any time we were confronted with any inordinate hardship, we could refuse to act on the understanding.
('6', 367, 1, 9, 696421) If gaol goingwhich we have been contemplatingcomes after this proposal, it will appear more graceful.
('6', 367, 1, 10, 696523) The ultimate remedy is, of course, gaol going.
('6', 367, 1, 11, 696570) The fact that this time we have not passed any resolution about going to gaol does not mean that, if the Bill is passed, we are not to court imprisonment.
('6', 367, 1, 12, 696725) No one should put the idea of going to gaol out of his mind.
('6', 367, 1, 13, 696786) After a vote of thanks to the chair, the meeting dispersed.

('6', 368, 25, 37, 698823) [April 8, 1907]
('6', 368, 26, 38, 698839) RESOLUTION OF SYMPATHY FOR TRANSVAAL INDIANS A largely attended meeting of the Natal Indian Congress was
('6', 368, 27, 39, 698944) 1 This was forwarded to the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies by L. W. Ritch on April 9. 2 Vide Chamneys Report,13 4 1907.
('6', 369, 0, 1, 699075) 370 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 369, 1, 2, 699117) held on Monday the 8th at about 8.30 p.m.
('6', 369, 1, 3, 699159) under the chairmanship of Mr. Dawad Mahomed.
('6', 369, 1, 4, 699204) Many members were present.
('6', 369, 1, 5, 699231) After the minutes of the last meeting and the accounts, etc., had been passed, a resolu tion, moved by Mr. Motilal Dewan and seconded by Mr. Peeran Mahomed, was passed expressing the sympathy of the Natal Indian Congress for the Transvaal Indians in their campaign against the Asiatic [Registration] Bill and appealing to the Imperial Government to accord adequate protection to the Indian community.
('6', 369, 1, 6, 699632) The Secretaries were asked to cable the resolution to the Imperial Government.
('6', 369, 2, 7, 699711) OMAR HAJI AMOD ZAVERIS RESIGNATION After this, the resignation of Mr. Omar Haji Amod Zaveri, who intends to go to India, was placed before the Congress for considera tion.
('6', 369, 2, 8, 699883) Mr. Gandhi, who was present at the meeting, said that the Cong ress had no alternative but to accept Mr. Zaveris resignation, and added that, though there was no other Indian who could fill the void, the best solution was to appoint Mr. Dada Osman as Joint Secretary.
('6', 369, 2, 9, 700151) Mr. Abdul Kadir was of the opinion that Mr. Zaveris resigna tion should be accepted with effect from the date of his departure and that it would be only right to hold another meeting to consider his resignation and the appointment of another Secretary.
('6', 369, 2, 10, 700404) Mr. Peeran Mahomed also supported Mr. Abdul Kadirs view and the subject of the resignation and appointment [of a successor] was postponed till the next meeting.
('6', 369, 2, 11, 700565) Mr. Lawrences letter suggesting the admission of young persons [to membership of the Congress] at reduced rates of subscri ption was then taken up for consideration.
('6', 369, 2, 12, 700731) After some deliberation, a resolution moved by Mr. Gandhi and seconded by Mr. Abdul Kadir was unanimously passed, appointing a committee consisting of Mr. Dawad Mahomed, the two Secretaries, Mr. Peeran Mahomed, Mr. Abdul Kadir, Mr. Abdul Haji Adam, Mr. Ismail Gora Mahomed and Mr. Gandhi to meet Mr. Lawrence and his friends [in this connect ion].
('6', 369, 2, 13, 701079) The committee was asked to suggest the necessary changes in the rules, regulations and the constitution of the Congress.
('6', 369, 2, 14, 701200) The meeting then dispersed.
('6', 369, 2, 15, 701228) After the scheduled meeting was over, Mr. Gandhi made a short speech.
('6', 369, 2, 16, 701298) He pointed out that malaria appeared to have broken out in epidemic form among the Indians on the east coast of Umgeni, 1 and

('6', 370, 1, 2, 701515) it was necessary for the community to help them to the utmost.
('6', 370, 1, 3, 701578) Young men who could spare the time should attend to the poor patients.
('6', 370, 1, 4, 701649) Dr. Nanji had offered all possible help, and if volunteers came forward to tend the sick, much useful work could be done.
('6', 370, 1, 5, 701771) It would redound to the fair name of the community and the volunteers would earn the gratitude of poor patients.
('6', 370, 1, 6, 701884) Even a single individual could do much.
('6', 370, 1, 7, 701924) The main thing to do was to go to the river bank, find the patients, inquire about their condition and report to the Congress Secretaries and to Dr. Nanji.
('6', 370, 1, 8, 702080) Many young men had already come forward to do this work with zeal.

('6', 370, 3, 11, 702226) MARITZBURG, April 9, 1907
('6', 370, 4, 12, 702252) [TO THE EDITOR NATAL ADVERTISER DURBAN]
('6', 370, 6, 13, 702292) You, as well as your contemporary The Natal Mercury, have commented adversely upon Reuters telegram regarding the report of the Registrar of Asiatics, published in the Transvaal, on the working of the permit system.
('6', 370, 6, 14, 702508) If the facts as you state were true, every word stated by you would be justified, and in order to deserve the credit for honesty, which you have been good enough to give me, I should undoubtedly have to recall all I have said in public in opposition to the allegations as to illegal Asiatic influx into the Transvaal on a wholesale basis.
('6', 370, 6, 15, 702847) Happily for the cause I have the privilege of serving, it is not necessary for me to withdraw anything I have hitherto said, for the simple reason that Reuters agency has been instrument all quite unwittinglyin telegraphing an utter mis statement.
('6', 370, 6, 16, 703095) It will now be difficult to entirely undo the mischief created.
('6', 370, 6, 17, 703159) Reuters telegram
('6', 370, 7, 18, 703176) 1 The Editor, The Natal Advertiser, replied as follows: ...As we are not in possession as yet of the report itself, we are unable to decide between Mr. Gandhis interpretation of it and Reuters...
('6', 371, 0, 1, 703372) 372 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 371, 1, 2, 703414) stated that out of 12,543 registrations only 4,144 were accepted as valid.
('6', 371, 1, 3, 703489) This is a condensation of a statement in the report which I have before me, and the condensation gives a meaning opposite to the one intended by the writer of the report.
('6', 371, 1, 4, 703660) Allow me to state the position as briefly as I can.
('6', 371, 1, 5, 703712) Registration is not to be mixed up with the taking out of permits.
('6', 371, 1, 6, 703779) In 1903 there were 12,543 Asiatics at least in theTransvaal with lawful authority.
('6', 371, 1, 7, 703862) Lord Milner some time during the year issued instructions to enforce Law 3 of 1885 and to exact 3 from those Asiatics who had not paid the amount to the late Boer Government, and in order to establish a uniform system of registration, he advised the Indian community to take out new certificates, both for those who had taken out 3 certificates before and those who had not.
('6', 371, 2, 8, 704237) This position the Indian community voluntarily accepted in order to please His Lordship.
('6', 371, 2, 9, 704326) What Mr. Chamney says in his report is that out of 12,543 men who presented themselves for registration, 4,144 were able to make good their claim for exemption from payment of 3. How many claimants were rejected is not stated, but the point is perfectly clear that this registration did not affect the validity of the permits already issued.
('6', 371, 2, 10, 704668) As a matter of fact, registration was granted only in favour of those who were in possession of permits.
('6', 371, 2, 11, 704773) The statement wired by Reuter, therefore, means that all but 4,144 had to pay the sum of 3 in order to take out registration certificates, which did not in any way replace the permits already issued, so that your inference that 8,000 have managed to enter the Colony illegally is quite wide of the mark.
('6', 371, 2, 12, 705077) The fact that 144 Asiatics died, and only four of their permits were recovered proves nothing except that the dead men forgot to return their permits in anticipa tion.
('6', 371, 2, 13, 705245) There is no law with reference to the return of these documents, and it should be remembered that the men died not in the Transvaal, but in India.
('6', 371, 2, 14, 705392) The only paragraph, therefore, in the report under discussion, dealing with illegal influx, is that wherein 876 men are alleged to have been found without permits or with stolen permits.
('6', 371, 2, 15, 705579) Assuming the accuracy of the figures given by Mr. Chamney, all that has been proved is that about fifty stragglers per month entered the Transvaal on false permits or without any.
('6', 371, 2, 16, 705759) I will not trespass on your courtesy by entering into further discussion beyond stating, without meaning any disparagement to Mr. Chamney, that he, lacking the judicial spirit, has not been able to distinguish between suspicion and proof, and has made statements which do not bear a judicial scrutiny.
('6', 372, 0, 1, 706061) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 373
('6', 372, 1, 2, 706105) They are no more than assertions unsupported by facts, though, as I have already stated, even the one assertion made in support of an illegal influx is capable of being very much boiled down.
('6', 372, 1, 3, 706297) There is, however, nothing in that report to prove that there has been any encouragement on the part of the Indian community as a whole to an illegal entry nor of illegal influx on a wholesale basis.
('6', 372, 1, 4, 706497) No one has ever denied the existence altogether of illegal entries, but it is the wholesale basis that has been challenged, and Mr. Chamneys report, even taken as it is, without considering the natural defects I have drawn attention to, furnishes a complete vindication of the British Indian position.
('6', 372, 1, 5, 706799) Incidentally, I might mention that your Johannesburg contemporary, The Rand Daily Mail, who had the opportunity of reading the report itself, has come to the conclusion opposite to yours, and it now asks whether, after all, the new Bill is any cure for the evil of illegal entries so far as they have been proved.
('6', 372, 2, 6, 707113) Yours, etc.

('6', 372, 5, 9, 707170) 331. CHAMNEYS REPORT
('6', 372, 6, 10, 707191) Our Johannesburg correspondents summary of Mr. Chamneys Report is well worth the reading.
('6', 372, 6, 11, 707281) It bears out three things: Mr. Chamneys hatred of the Indian community, his lack of a sense of justice and the validity of the facts stated by the Indian community.
('6', 372, 6, 12, 707446) Mr. Chamneys hatred is in evidence in every line he has written.
('6', 372, 6, 13, 707511) He has made mountains out of molehills, and has at times made unfounded statements.
('6', 372, 6, 14, 707595) He says that many people sell old registers for large sums of money but has not been able to adduce any evidence.
('6', 372, 6, 15, 707709) He has mentioned 876 persons as having entered without permits, but does not indicate how they did it.
('6', 372, 6, 16, 707812) He does not have the rights of a magistrate and cannot therefore say of a particular person that he has entered unlawfully.
('6', 372, 6, 17, 707936) He can only express his suspicion of people having entered without permits.
('6', 372, 6, 18, 708012) However, when he asserts that some persons have come in without permits, it only shows his animus and lack of a sense of justice.
('6', 372, 6, 19, 708142) Again, he says that the many Indians who were sent back from Durban and others who entered surreptitiously and were arrested are not included in the 876
('6', 373, 0, 1, 708295) 374 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 373, 1, 2, 708337) mentioned earlier.
('6', 373, 1, 3, 708356) Not one of these facts has any relevance to establishing the number of people who have entered unlawfully.
('6', 373, 1, 4, 708463) He has brought in these facts only to magnify the issue.
('6', 373, 1, 5, 708520) Despite this exaggerated statement of facts, it is not proved that the Indian community gets many persons to enter without permits or that many persons do in fact enter without them.
('6', 373, 1, 6, 708703) Even if Mr. Chamneys figure is correct, it will only mean that 50 percent Indians have entered the Transvaal each month; it will be quite improper to term this an invasion.
('6', 373, 1, 7, 708876) Again, Mr. Chamneys Report bears out the Indian communitys statement that the new Bill is absolutely unnecessary.
('6', 373, 1, 8, 708990) He points out that there is nothing in the existing law to compel a person to give his thumb impression.
('6', 373, 1, 9, 709095) This is not true, for the Indian community has never been unwilling to give thumb impressions.
('6', 373, 1, 10, 709190) Besides, if anyone refuses, he can be charged with staying on [in the Colony] without a permit and brought before a court, where he will have to give his thumb impression.
('6', 373, 1, 11, 709362) The new Bill, then, is superfluous if it is only for taking a thumb impression.
('6', 373, 1, 12, 709442) Now Mr. Chamney also says that the law as it stands is inadequate to prevent children from entering the Colony.
('6', 373, 1, 13, 709554) If that were really so, then [how is it that] we do not find any restrictions in the new Bill on the entry of children accompanying their parents[?] This means that the new law does not provide that remedy and that the new Bill is therefore altogether useless.
('6', 373, 1, 14, 709815) Even The Rand Daily Mail now admits this.
('6', 373, 1, 15, 709857) Taking all this into consideration, we see that Mr. Chamneys Report cannot at all be taken seriously.

('6', 373, 5, 19, 710041) Mr. Omar Haji Amod Zaveri has, owing to some other very important work, resigned his office of Joint Secretary of the Natal Indian Congress.
('6', 373, 5, 20, 710182) Mr. Omar Zaveri is unique and unrivalled not only in Natal, but in the whole of South Africa.
('6', 373, 5, 21, 710276) It is, in our view, no exag geration at all to say that there is no Indian who is his peer.
('6', 373, 5, 22, 710368) He will be leaving [for India] very shortly.
('6', 373, 5, 23, 710413) In honouring him we shall be hon ouring ourselves.
('6', 373, 5, 24, 710464) The Congress will, of course, felicitate him.
('6', 373, 5, 25, 710510) But we hope that other bodies also will honour him on their own to show their
('6', 374, 0, 1, 710588) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 375
('6', 374, 1, 2, 710632) appreciation of his equal regard for all.
('6', 374, 1, 3, 710674) It is not necessary to hold separate functions.
('6', 374, 1, 4, 710722) Other bodies besides the Congress can honour him [separately] at the same place and time; and that will only be proper.

('6', 374, 2, 6, 710884) 333. TALE OF WOE IN SOUTH AFRICA
('6', 374, 3, 7, 710917) Many persons have suggested to us that we should publish an account of the hardships we suffer in South Africa.
('6', 374, 3, 8, 711029) The book should include a translation of petitions, etc., up to date.
('6', 374, 3, 9, 711099) There is no doubt that such a book 1, if published, would be useful and give much food for thought.
('6', 374, 3, 10, 711199) It may perhaps run to a thousand pages andcannot be brought out at a low price; A copy will cost five shillings.
('6', 374, 3, 11, 711312) We cannot venture on such a publication unless a sale of 500 copies is assured in advance.
('6', 374, 3, 12, 711403) We shall be in a position to consider the matter further, if the gentlemen who wish to see the book in print write to us further about it.

('6', 374, 5, 15, 711617) For a long time now, the discussion has gone on about presenting an address, on behalf of the Indian community, to Mr. Alexander, the retired Police Superintendent.
('6', 374, 5, 16, 711782) Much time has elapsed since.
('6', 374, 5, 17, 711811) The longer we take over it the more it reveals our fickleness.
('6', 374, 5, 18, 711874) We therefore suggest to the leaders of the community that they fulfil without further delay the task undertaken by them.

('6', 375, 1, 4, 712432) They entertain him at dinner partiesa thing which did not happen before.
('6', 375, 1, 5, 712505) In the course of his tour he visited the Aligarh College, where the students welcomed him with great respect.
('6', 375, 1, 6, 712615) In a speech on the occasion, he pointed out that, without self help, we would not be rid of our miseries.
('6', 375, 1, 7, 712721) He was the guest of Nawab Mohsin ul Mulk of the College.
('6', 375, 1, 8, 712778) A magnificent banquet was given there in his honour.
('6', 375, 1, 9, 712831) He also visited Allahabad, Lucknow, Lahore, Amritsar and other places, and through his speeches he has contributed towards awakening and unifying the people.

('6', 375, 5, 14, 713166) He has divided Kabul into forty wards for that purpose.
('6', 375, 5, 15, 713222) Besides, the work of translating good books for Habibia University is also going on.
('6', 375, 5, 16, 713307) So is the task of imparting medical education.
('6', 375, 5, 17, 713354) A programme of industrial education is likely to start this month.
('6', 375, 5, 18, 713421) They are also thinking of sending out students for education in Europe and Japan at state expense.

('6', 376, 8, 12, 714290) DEPUTATION TO SMUTS I wrote last week that a deputation would wait upon Mr. Smuts and place before him the resolution passed at the mass meeting.
('6', 376, 8, 13, 714436) 5 Mr. Smuts had fixed Thursday the 4th for the interview.
('6', 376, 8, 14, 714494) Under a special arrangement with the General Manager of the Railways, Messrs Abdul Gani, Coovadia, Essop Mian, Haji Ojer Ally, Moonlight and Gandhi travelled from Johannesburg to Pretoria by the 8.35 express train.
('6', 376, 8, 15, 714709) At Pretoria they were joined by Messrs Mahomed Haji Joosab and Gaurishankar Vyas.
('6', 376, 8, 16, 714791) They reached the Colonial Office exactly at 12, where Mr. Chamney was also present.
('6', 376, 8, 17, 714875) Mr. Gandhi narrated all the facts to Mr. Smuts.
('6', 376, 8, 18, 714923) He reminded Mr. Smuts that the Indian community had itself registered several times.
('6', 376, 8, 19, 715008) He said that Mr. Chamneys Report supported the Indian contention and showed in other ways also that the Indians were trust worthy.
('6', 376, 8, 20, 715139) It was with the help of the Indian community that officials of the Asiatic Office who took bribes had been arrested.
('6', 376, 8, 21, 715256) Taking al] this into consideration, Mr. Gandhi said, the Government should, on this occasion, agree to the proposal of voluntary registration made in the Second Resolution passed by the mass meeting.
('6', 376, 8, 22, 715456) Then Mr. Haji Ojer Ally advanced further arguments to bear out what Mr. Gandhi had said and drew Mr. Smutss attention to the loyalty of the Indian community.
('6', 376, 8, 23, 715614) Messrs Abdul Gani and Essop

('6', 377, 1, 2, 715799) Mian also used other arguments and pointed out the difficulties they had in bringing servants, etc.
('6', 377, 1, 3, 715899) [from India].
('6', 377, 1, 4, 715913) Mr. Smuts listened to this carefully for more than three quarters of an hour.
('6', 377, 1, 5, 715991) At the end he said that he had heard several things for the first time, and these he said he would inquire into and send a written reply 1; but the deputation should not interpret this to mean that the Government would agree to the Second Resolution.
('6', 377, 1, 6, 716242) This reply means that a situation has now arisen which is similar to that which existed when the Deputation waited upon Lord Elgin, and that the Second Resolution might have some effect if a third party could explain the matter to Mr. Smuts.
('6', 377, 1, 7, 716484) Accordingly, Mr. Polak saw Mr. Gregorowski on Friday, and the latter expressed sympathy.
('6', 377, 1, 8, 716573) Much appears to depend on Mr. Chamney.
('6', 377, 1, 9, 716612) If he says that he can, according to the Indian proposal, register people without legislation, Mr. Smuts will very probably accept it.
('6', 377, 1, 10, 716747) Mr. Polak appears to have done very good work at Pretoria.
('6', 377, 1, 11, 716806) He spent the whole of Friday meeting people.
('6', 377, 1, 12, 716851) He saw the editors of the Pretoria News and The Transvaal Advertiser, and also Mr. De Vet.
('6', 377, 1, 13, 716942) None of them had really understood the facts before, but they have now begun to do so and have moreover promised to give all possible help.
('6', 377, 2, 14, 717082) CHAMNEYS REPORT2
('6', 377, 3, 15, 717099) Mr. Chamneys Report for the year 1906 has been published.
('6', 377, 3, 16, 717157) It says that 12,899 permits had been issued to Asiatics till December 31, 1905. The Governments decision was to issue permits to those Asiatics who had been resident in the Transvaal before the war.
('6', 377, 3, 17, 717356) It was difficult to ascertain who the old residents of the Transvaal were as the registers maintained before 1899 had been lost.
('6', 377, 3, 18, 717485) Moreover, as receipts were issued [without names?] to those who paid the 3 tax, it was impossible to determine who had paid the amount [sic].
('6', 377, 3, 19, 717627) Many persons used to sell these certificates at high prices.
('6', 377, 3, 20, 717688) Of the 12,543 permit holders, 4,144 had earlier paid 3 each.
('6', 377, 3, 21, 717749) On some registers it was found that something had been over written in Hindustani which would suggest that the registers must have originally belonged to other persons.
('6', 377, 3, 22, 717918) In the issue of permits the concurrence of two authorities is at present necessary.
('6', 377, 3, 23, 718002) The first is that of the Coast Agent

('6', 378, 1, 3, 718296) At Johannesburg the investigation is made by the Police Commissioner, and no permit is issued to anyone who fails to produce satisfactory evidence.
('6', 378, 1, 4, 718444) In all, 598 permits were issued from 1905 to December 1906; 3,286 applications for permits were rejected.
('6', 378, 1, 5, 718550) Of these, 1,240 were Indian and 1,238 Chinese.
('6', 378, 1, 6, 718597) In addition to these, there are many Asiatics in the Transvaal who have entered the Colony without a permit or with permits belonging to others.
('6', 378, 1, 7, 718742) All these persons cannot be apprehended as they cannot all be forced to give their thumb impressions.
('6', 378, 1, 8, 718844) Such persons number 876. Of these, 215 have been prosecuted and sentenced.
('6', 378, 1, 9, 718919) This figure does not include those who have infiltrated into the territory undetected.
('6', 378, 1, 10, 719006) Nothing can be done against them.
('6', 378, 1, 11, 719040) Nor does this number include the l41 who were turned back from Durban.
('6', 378, 1, 12, 719111) The greatest difficulty is met with in the case of Asiatic boys.
('6', 378, 1, 13, 719176) It is not clear from the Supreme Courts decision for what [categories of] boys a permit is obligatory.
('6', 378, 1, 14, 719279) Because of this many Indian boys have come in.
('6', 378, 1, 15, 719326) It was for this reason that the Asiatic Law Amendment Ordinance was introduced.
('6', 378, 1, 16, 719406) According to the 1904 census, there were 1,774 Asiatic boys below the age of 15. It was found that 417 permits had been lost.
('6', 378, 1, 17, 719532) The following is the classification of Asiatics according to occupations:

('6', 379, 1, 2, 720035) COMMENTS BY THE RAND DAILY MAIL
('6', 379, 2, 3, 720067) The Rand Daily Mail of Johannesburg has strongly criticized the Report.
('6', 379, 2, 4, 720139) It says that Mr. Chamney has given the reasons for restricting Asiatic immigration; but he has not been able to show that anything more than the existing Act is necessary.
('6', 379, 2, 5, 720311) Mr. Chamneys Report conclusively shows that the present procedure has failed.
('6', 379, 2, 6, 720389) If that is so, that procedure is not likely to change under the new law.
('6', 379, 2, 7, 720462) There is no reason to believe that any great change will be effected in the matter of taking ten finger prints instead of the thumb impression.
('6', 379, 2, 8, 720606) What is now needed is therefore not a new law but a new procedure.
('6', 379, 2, 9, 720673) If a new procedure is evolved in consultation with the leaders of the Indian community, it will be very convenient and avoid friction which at present appears probablewith the Imperial Government.
('6', 379, 2, 10, 720870) It would have been better if Mr. Chamney had, instead of merely pointing out the existing defects, shown the way for the future.
('6', 379, 3, 11, 720999) CABLES TO ENGLAND
('6', 379, 4, 12, 721017) After the Colonial Secretary had refused to forward the cablegram about the Asiatic Bill, the President of the [British Indian] Association inquired of Lord Selborne what was to be done.
('6', 379, 4, 13, 721204) 1 The latter replied that he could not interfere with what the local Government had done.
('6', 379, 4, 14, 721294) So last Saturday, the Association sent a long cablegram 2 directly to Lord Elgin.
('6', 379, 4, 15, 721376) A brief cablegram 3 regarding the deputation was also sent to the South Africa British Indian Committee.
('6', 379, 4, 16, 721481) These cablegrams cost 28.
('6', 379, 5, 17, 721507) FOR HAWKERS The Chamber of Commerce has suggested the enactment of a special law for hawkers.
('6', 379, 5, 18, 721601) One of the suggestions is that no hawker should be permitted to stop for business at the same spot for more than 20 minutes, that no hawker should visit a place twice the same day and that hawkers should be allowed to sell their wares on the main thoroughfares only.
('6', 379, 5, 19, 721868) These suggestions have not yet been accepted.
('6', 379, 5, 20, 721914) If they are, the plight of the hawkers will become very sad indeed.

('6', 380, 1, 2, 722183) WARNING ABOUT PERMITS It came to my knowledge from several sources that some persons, especially a white among them, have been selling permits to Indians.
('6', 380, 1, 3, 722338) This is very likely true.
('6', 380, 1, 4, 722364) Heavy sums are being paid for such permits by some Indians.
('6', 380, 1, 5, 722424) I must tell them that such permits are of no use whatever.
('6', 380, 1, 6, 722483) Those buying them would be committing an offence, which would be like paying for bringing trouble upon oneself.
('6', 380, 1, 7, 722595) It should be easy to see that there will be no duplicates of false permits in the Permit Office and that permits of which no duplicates are available in the Permit Office will be considered faked.
('6', 380, 2, 8, 722792) CLARIFICATION OF MARCH 31 NOTICE The Editor has forwarded to me a question raised by a correspondent from Johannesburg.
('6', 380, 2, 9, 722912) The correspondent inquires whether the holder of a register who fails to get a permit before March 31 will be liable only to being served with a notice asking him to quit the Transvaal or if he will also be punished in some other way.
('6', 380, 2, 10, 723147) The answer is that a person charged with staying in the Transvaal without a permit, will only get a notice.
('6', 380, 3, 11, 723255) SUGGESTION TO JOHANNESBURG CORRESPONDENTS
('6', 380, 4, 12, 723297) Immediate disposal of letters and other communications will be possible if correspondents in Johannesburg send them to the Johannes burg Office of the Opinion.
('6', 380, 4, 13, 723457) For some time is wasted in having such papers redirected from Phoenix to Johannesburg.
('6', 380, 4, 14, 723544) Communications should be addressed to P. O. Box 6522.

('6', 381, 6, 6, 724127) CHHAGANLAL,
('6', 381, 7, 7, 724139) I have your letter.
('6', 381, 7, 8, 724159) I had asked you a question about your health.
('6', 381, 7, 9, 724205) I still await your answer.
('6', 381, 7, 10, 724232) I am glad that you are better now.
('6', 381, 8, 11, 724267) It is likely that the money from Gaurishankar will be received here.
('6', 381, 8, 12, 724336) As soon as it comes I shall send it on to you.
('6', 381, 8, 13, 724383) If there are any dues outstanding from him please let me know.
('6', 381, 9, 14, 724446) If you have come across any reactions to the article about Hejaz 3
('6', 381, 10, 15, 724513) please let me know what the reactions were like and from whom.
('6', 381, 11, 16, 724576) The issue of Al Islam has been received.
('6', 381, 11, 17, 724617) About Thakkar you should do as you think best.
('6', 381, 11, 18, 724664) If you do as I suggested, you will be able gradually to bring him round.
('6', 381, 11, 19, 724737) Keep me informed regularly so that the matter does not slip from my mind.
('6', 381, 12, 20, 724811) Mr. MacIntyre has left.
('6', 381, 12, 21, 724835) But we can carry on without him.
('6', 381, 12, 22, 724868) He is on the look out for a job.
('6', 381, 13, 23, 724901) I have had some talk about Kalyandas.
('6', 381, 13, 24, 724939) Please send him a reply.
('6', 381, 14, 25, 724964) I have received last months account of the household expenses.
('6', 381, 14, 26, 725027) Looking at it and the expenses of the current month I am afraid that, do what we will, we shall not be able to meet all the expenses.
('6', 381, 14, 27, 725161) You should send me details as to how all this expenditure was incurred so that I can understand.
('6', 381, 15, 28, 725258) Chhabildas 4 told me as much about Chanchal 5 as he knew.

('6', 382, 6, 21, 726477) 341. DUTY OF TRANSVAAL INDIANS
('6', 382, 7, 22, 726508) We invite the attention of the Transvaal Indians to a summary of Mr. Tilaks speech printed elsewhere.
('6', 382, 7, 23, 726610) On them rests a great responsibility; they have passed a resolution about going to gaol in case the new Bill becomes law.
('6', 382, 7, 24, 726732) Whether or not we should take an oath or whether or not the September oath still binds us is no longer a question to be decided.
('6', 382, 7, 25, 726861) The important thing is that we have declared to the world our determination not to submit to the law.
('6', 382, 7, 26, 726963) It is on this basis that Mr. Ritch is carrying on the struggle.
('6', 382, 7, 27, 727027) On that basis too, the Deputation went to England, and on that basis several whites have been helping us.
('6', 382, 7, 28, 727133) The matter is so serious that it has set even Mr. Smuts thinking.
('6', 382, 7, 29, 727199) It was because the resolution about gaol going was passed that the Kimberley people as also the Natal Congress have sent telegrams.
('6', 382, 7, 30, 727331) This is no time for fear.
('6', 382, 7, 31, 727357) The Transvaal Indians have to adhere steadfastly to the gaol going Resolution for the sake of their own honour and that of the entire Indian community.

('6', 383, 1, 2, 727650) Mr. Tilaks speech applies to us also.
('6', 383, 1, 3, 727688) Our demand will not be accepted until we force them to do so.
('6', 383, 1, 4, 727750) The unfailing remedy of gaol going is our [method of] boycott 1, our weapon.
('6', 383, 1, 5, 727827) There can be no question of its failing.
('6', 383, 1, 6, 727868) For how can there be defeat for one who has gone to gaol?
('6', 383, 1, 7, 727926) Once more we remind the Transvaal Indian community that it is because the Cape Coloureds opposed the Pass Act, refused to take out passes and went to gaol that the Cape Government does not any longer compel them to take out passes.
('6', 383, 1, 8, 728158) Though the Pass Act applies to them, the Government is unable to enforce it.
('6', 383, 1, 9, 728235) We should under no circumstances prove ourselves more timid than the Coloured persons.
('6', 383, 1, 10, 728322) All our efforts will be in vain if we do not act up to the assurance which Mr. Ritch has given to Lord Ampthill.
('6', 383, 1, 11, 728435) If the Indiancommunity remains firm in its resolution about gaol going, we may as well take it that the new law has not been passed at all.

('6', 383, 3, 14, 728647) Nowadays the British welcome ministers from the Colonies.
('6', 383, 3, 15, 728705) Dr. Jameson who once thought of capturing the land of the Boers is being greeted with loud acclamation.
('6', 383, 3, 16, 728809) Wherever he and other ministers from the Colonies go, they are profusely honoured.
('6', 383, 3, 17, 728892) Nobody thinks of their faults; their virtues alone are taken into account.
('6', 383, 3, 18, 728967) All this is as it should be.
('6', 383, 3, 19, 728996) Only under such conditions can the people rise.
('6', 383, 3, 20, 729044) The Colonies are like the children of the British.
('6', 383, 3, 21, 729095) It is nothing surprising if a father meets his children with warmth and enthusiasm, unmindful of their faults and perceptive only of their virtues.
('6', 383, 3, 22, 729243) Where such a relationship obtains, the family prospers; a people, similarly, thrives on such relationships.
('6', 383, 3, 23, 729351) This is one of the potent causes of the prosperity of the British.
('6', 383, 3, 24, 729418) They do not envy the rise of their kith and kin.
('6', 383, 3, 25, 729467) Again the ministers who receive so much honour are brave persons.
('6', 383, 3, 26, 729533) They are not the sort of persons to be overawed by others and they will take any risks for their country.
('6', 383, 3, 27, 729639) That is why the British welcome them with acclamation.

('6', 384, 1, 3, 729910) Though not an Englishman, he possesses the virtues of one and is moreover a brave fighter.
('6', 384, 1, 4, 730001) He said, There was a time when during the war I was beleaguered by the British.
('6', 384, 1, 5, 730081) Today I feel happy to be surrounded by them, yet have no misgivings.
('6', 384, 1, 6, 730150) Rather, It shall feel the happier if more of you gather round me. He made this speech in Dutch to show his patriotism.
('6', 384, 1, 7, 730269) Knowing all this as we do, we must not envy them; on the contrary we should congratulate them.
('6', 384, 1, 8, 730364) And, if we have any public spirit, we should, like them, engage in the work of public welfare and be prepared, like them, even to die for it.

('6', 384, 3, 11, 730571) The outcome of the eleven Ladysmith appeals that were preferred to the Supreme Court has confirmed our expectations.Since the licensing court 1 gave judgement without taking any evidence, these cases cannot really be called appeals.
('6', 384, 3, 12, 730804) The Supreme Court has on this ground set aside the judgement of the appellate court and ordered a re hearing of these cases.
('6', 384, 3, 13, 730929) The eleven applicants who have been refused licences can appeal again.
('6', 384, 3, 14, 731000) And if, after taking evidence, the appellate court still refuses obstinately to issue a licence, there is nothing the applicants can do.
('6', 384, 3, 15, 731137) It is a bad thing that in this case the court has not allowed costs to the appellants, as it did in the Somnath Maharaj case.
('6', 384, 3, 16, 731263) If costs had been allowed, the appellate court would have been a little more careful.
('6', 384, 3, 17, 731349) We cannot regard the [result of the] appeals as a complete victory.
('6', 384, 3, 18, 731417) The Licensing Act remains what it has always been.
('6', 384, 3, 19, 731468) But since we did not expect any sensational result, there is no cause for despair.
('6', 384, 3, 20, 731551) The Natal Indian Congress must persevere with the struggle.
('6', 384, 3, 21, 731611) If adequate efforts are made, the licensing act will be repealed.

('6', 385, 2, 3, 731794) Lord Cromer has relinquished the post of British Comptroller General in Egypt, mentioning his ill health as the reason.
('6', 385, 2, 4, 731914) He introdu ced many reforms in Egypt.
('6', 385, 2, 5, 731952) He gave the Egyptian people education, thus awakening in them a national consciousness.
('6', 385, 2, 6, 732040) Now the same Egyptians have risen against Lord Cromer, because he wants to dis pose of unlimited powers.
('6', 385, 2, 7, 732145) Sir Eldon Gorst has been appointed in his place.
('6', 385, 2, 8, 732194) It is said that Sir Eldon will adhere to the policy of Lord Cro mer.
('6', 385, 2, 9, 732263) However, the Liberal Press in England recognizes and desiresthat more power should be granted to the Egyptian people.
('6', 385, 2, 10, 732381) The Egyptian Press also hopes that the change in the office will result in the devol ution of more power to the people.
('6', 385, 2, 11, 732501) In any case, it is clear that the me mbers of the Liberal Party today desire that people all over the British Empire should enjoy a greater share of power [in government].

('6', 385, 5, 14, 732740) COLONIAL SECRETARYS REPLY
('6', 385, 6, 15, 732766) I have already reported on the deputation.
('6', 385, 6, 16, 732809) 1 The following is the reply 2 received from Mr. Smuts.
('6', 385, 6, 17, 732865) 1. I am obliged to the Indian community for your letter of the 30th and for the representation made to me during the Indian deputations interview with me on the Asiatic Registration Act and other subjects.
('6', 385, 6, 18, 733071) Objecting to the new Act the deputation said that it would only serve to harass the Indian community, that it was unneces sary in view of the communitys willingness to take out new registers voluntarily, and that it was humiliating because it made registration compulsory.
('6', 385, 6, 19, 733344) The deputation also pointed out that the [Indian] grievance regarding land rights under Law[3] of 1885was not being redressed, and that the difficulties experienced by those coming to
('6', 385, 7, 20, 733528) 1 Vide Johannesburg Letter, 20 4 1907. 2 Smuts had promised a written reply to the Indian deputation which met him in connection with the new Transvaal Asiatic Registration Act.

('6', 386, 1, 2, 733787) the Colony for a temporary stay should be remedied.
('6', 386, 1, 3, 733839) 2. All this has been carefully considered and I have to point out that Section 17 of the new Act provides for the issue of a temporary permit.
('6', 386, 1, 4, 733982) 3. As for land rights, I regret to say that the Government can grant no more relief than the specific reference in Section 21 to the land belonging to a particular person.
('6', 386, 2, 5, 734154) 4. As for the other grounds on which objections have been raised against the Act, I have to assure you that the Government intends no insult to the Asiatic community.
('6', 386, 2, 6, 734321) At the same time, it cannot be deniedthat the question of marks which will make the identification of Asiatic people possible is full of difficulties.
('6', 386, 2, 7, 734472) The main aim of the new Act is to adopt such means as will make it easy to identify persons of that community with a view to ascertaining who are entitled to reside here.
('6', 386, 2, 8, 734643) The new Act is necessary to achieve this object.
('6', 386, 2, 9, 734692) I regret to have to say that the suggestion made by the deputation about fresh registrationcannot be accepted.
('6', 386, 2, 10, 734803) For doing so a proviso for compul sory registration is necessary.
('6', 386, 2, 11, 734869) Moreover, I cannot see how you could say with certainty that your word would be binding on other Asiatic communities, and particularly on those residing without a permit.
('6', 386, 2, 12, 735040) 5. There is no doubt that many whites hold that a number of Asiatics is infiltrating into this territory without permits.
('6', 386, 2, 13, 735162) And they also find that people have been doing so because there is no adequate law in force to identify the [lawfully resident] Asiatics.
('6', 386, 2, 14, 735300) It is not possible for the Government to ignore this feeling.
('6', 386, 2, 15, 735362) Moreover, the Government has strong evidence of such unlawful infiltration.
('6', 386, 2, 16, 735438) Considering this matter, I am sorry to find that, in your meeting and speeches, people have been advised to disobey the law by not registering themselves.
('6', 386, 2, 17, 735593) In your own interests, I expect you will not advocate a course of action that will make it impossible for us to grant special concessions to your community.
('6', 386, 2, 18, 735750) I sincerely hope therefore that your community, which has always had the privilege of being considered law abiding, will maintain its reputation in the matter and that Indians will co operate with the Government in every way by registering themselves lawfully, gracefully and expeditiously.
('6', 386, 2, 19, 736041) The Act has been framed in the
('6', 386, 3, 20, 736072) 1 The reference is to the specific provision exempting the heirs of Abubaker Amod Zaveri from Law 3 of 1885 and other laws relating to ownership of land by Indians.

('6', 387, 0, 1, 736299) 388 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 387, 1, 2, 736341) interests of both the Asiatics and the whites.
('6', 387, 1, 3, 736388) If the Act were regarded as not binding, greater pressure would be brought on the Government as well as parliament to take more stringent measures to prevent Asiatics from entering without a permit.
('6', 387, 2, 4, 736587) REFLECTIONS ON REPLY The reply is at once good and bad, timorous and threatening.
('6', 387, 2, 5, 736669) I call it good because it is courteous.
('6', 387, 2, 6, 736709) If the Government wanted to disregard the Indian community altogether, they could have disposed of the matter with a two line reply, without giving reasons.
('6', 387, 2, 7, 736866) The reason why I call it bad is that Mr. Smuts hesitates to accept even our most reasonable demands.
('6', 387, 2, 8, 736967) It is timorous, because of the ideas [of Indians], [their] resolutions and speeches on the subject of gaol going, the Government is afraid that the Indian community may [actually] display such strength, for then the Act may be proved ineffective.
('6', 387, 2, 9, 737214) It is threatening, because the Government, being frightened as we have shown above, hold out the threat that, if we do not accept the law, more stringent measures will follow; they hope that they can avoid a difficult situation if, under the threat of severe consequences, we can be made to give up the idea of going to gaol.
('6', 387, 2, 10, 737540) Now what is to be done?
('6', 387, 2, 11, 737564) The present is a crucial moment.
('6', 387, 2, 12, 737597) If we are imbued with the right spirit and care for our honour, we shall win.
('6', 387, 2, 13, 737675) We should certainly not be cowed down by the Governments threat, for what greater pain can they inflict on us than the law they have already passed?
('6', 387, 2, 14, 737824) What greater harm can be done to a man than to divest him of his honour?
('6', 387, 2, 15, 737897) On the one hand, we are being persuaded to help in enforcing the law and, on the other, they pass an act which proclaims that, in the whole Indian community, there is not a single person trustworthy enough to be exempted from holding a registration certificate, that is, a thief pass.
('6', 387, 2, 16, 738182) We are first made out to be thieves and our help is then sought in enforcing the law!
('6', 387, 2, 17, 738268) Nowhere is it stated [in Mr. Smutss reply] that even a single right will be granted to us.
('6', 387, 2, 18, 738359) The land right has been flatly denied.
('6', 387, 2, 19, 738398) Locations still loom before our eyes.
('6', 387, 2, 20, 738436) What further humiliation can be inflicted on those who have been degraded to the lowest depths?
('6', 387, 2, 21, 738532) In the present age and according to European standards, there can be no love without fear.
('6', 387, 2, 22, 738623) We have the example of Mr. Smutss own people with whom the British Government argued in a similar fashion.
('6', 387, 2, 23, 738730) They told President Kruger that it would be better to concede certain rights
('6', 388, 0, 1, 738807) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 389
('6', 388, 1, 2, 738851) to the British, else the Dutch would have to suffer.
('6', 388, 1, 3, 738904) President Kruger paid no heed to such bland words.
('6', 388, 1, 4, 738955) Nor was he afraid of the threat.
('6', 388, 1, 5, 738988) He himself remained courageous and inspired bravery in his people, and thus immortalized them and himself.
('6', 388, 1, 6, 739095) As a result, the people have today regained what was once theirs.
('6', 388, 1, 7, 739161) Many Dutchmen died on the battle field; their women and children were ruined.
('6', 388, 1, 8, 739239) But the survivors rule today.
('6', 388, 1, 9, 739269) Thus those who lost their lives are not dead, but have become immortal.
('6', 388, 1, 10, 739341) We shall win only if we do the same, but somewhat differently.
('6', 388, 1, 11, 739404) All the assurances that Mr. Smuts or others may offer are to he shunned like sugar coated pills of poison.
('6', 388, 1, 12, 739511) If we turn back now, we may be sure that we shall for ever remain entrapped.
('6', 388, 1, 13, 739588) It was thoughts such as these that impelled the meeting of the Association on Thursday the 11th to send Mr. Smuts a letter over the signature of its Acting Chairman, Mr. Essop Mian.
('6', 388, 1, 14, 739770) It is politely worded, but upholds our honour.
('6', 388, 1, 15, 739817) A translation of it is given below:
('6', 388, 2, 16, 739853) ASSOCIATIONS REPLY
('6', 388, 3, 17, 739872) I have received your letter of the 8th instant about the suggestion of the Indian community regarding the Asiatic Bill.
('6', 388, 3, 18, 739992) My Association is very grateful to the Government for its deta iled and sympathetic reply.
('6', 388, 3, 19, 740083) However, I approach them with a request to reconsider the matter in the light of the following.
('6', 388, 3, 20, 740179) The objections raised by the Indian community are so impor tant, and the suggestion it has made so just and proper that my Association finds it necessary to persuade the Government to accept it.
('6', 388, 3, 21, 740374) May I take the liberty of reminding you that, under Lord Milners advice, the Indian community had agreed to registra tion on the same lines as now proposed, and that the Chinese community had also accepted it?
('6', 388, 3, 22, 740584) My Association would humbly state that there is no need to make a promise, as the proposal is such that it could be immediately implemented.
('6', 388, 3, 23, 740725) Moreover, it can be ascertained, without loss of time, how many Asiatics are agreeable to taking out the new registers in place of their pre sent permits.
('6', 388, 3, 24, 740880) Your Honours letter raises the question of permitless persons.
('6', 388, 3, 25, 740943) But that question does not arise from our suggestion or from the new Act.
('6', 388, 3, 26, 741017) For in neither case will such men be able to obtain permits.
('6', 388, 3, 27, 741078) When fresh registration is completed, it will
('6', 389, 0, 1, 741124) 390 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 389, 1, 2, 741166) remain only to detect those without permits, and to serve them with quit notices for unlawful residence in the Colony.
('6', 389, 1, 3, 741285) My Association admits that European residents are excited about many Indians entering the Colony without permits and it is for that very reason that my community has made the forego ing suggestion which provides for adequate means of our identi fication.
('6', 389, 1, 4, 741540) And when the existing documents are withdrawn [after the issue of new registers,] there will be no difficulty about identification.
('6', 389, 1, 5, 741672) However, I must say that, whatever the means for establishing identity, those bent on entering surreptitiously will continue todo so anyhow.
('6', 389, 1, 6, 741813) I must also add that not many persons enter in this manner and that Mr. Chamneys Report is enough proof of it.
('6', 389, 1, 7, 741924) My Association therefore prays that the Government reconsider the matter, and hopes that, after doing so, they will come to entertain a better opinion of the Indian communitys proposal.
('6', 389, 1, 8, 742110) You refer to the Resolutions about defying the law.
('6', 389, 1, 9, 742162) We must point out in reply that there can be no question of defying the law at all.
('6', 389, 1, 10, 742246) However, if, for any reason, Indians respect for the law is put to a severe strain and if in that context the community seeks to vindicate its honour and prestige, the only way open to it will be to submit to the ultimate penalty prescribed by law, that is, to go to gaol.
('6', 389, 1, 11, 742519) Such action cannot be construed as a desire on the part of the Indian community to disobey the law.
('6', 389, 1, 12, 742619) However, the community desires humbly to point out that the new law gravely offends against its feelings.
('6', 389, 1, 13, 742725) It implies that the Indian community wishes to defeat the objects of the law.
('6', 389, 1, 14, 742803) On the contrary, through this suggestion, the community [seeks to] fulfil the intention of the law.
('6', 389, 1, 15, 742903) My Association therefore humbly requests that the Indian proposal be given a trial before the law is enforced.
('6', 389, 1, 16, 743014) It makes this suggestion in the conviction that all Asiatic communities will act according to it.
('6', 389, 2, 17, 743112) CONSEQUENCE OF REPLY It cannot be predicted how the Government will react to this reply.
('6', 389, 2, 18, 743201) But it is certain that it will set the Government thinking.
('6', 389, 2, 19, 743261) They have themselves raised the question of gaol going.
('6', 389, 2, 20, 743317) If we retract now,
('6', 390, 0, 1, 743336) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 391
('6', 390, 1, 2, 743380) that will only serve to show up the abjectness of the community.
('6', 390, 1, 3, 743445) The reply has in it neither bitterness nor threat.
('6', 390, 1, 4, 743496) It is polite but firm, and reflects the courageous mood of the community.
('6', 390, 2, 5, 743570) CHINESE MOVE
('6', 390, 3, 6, 743583) The Chinese leaders met last Saturday at Mr. Gandhis office and resolved to support the Indian community.
('6', 390, 3, 7, 743689) The Chinese Consul has also given them similar advice.
('6', 390, 3, 8, 743744) It is thus seen that we get support from all quarters.
('6', 390, 4, 9, 743799) ASIATIC EATING HOUSES
('6', 390, 5, 10, 743821) Notwithstanding the Associations struggle against the regulat ions concerning Asiatic eating houses, they have been passed and already published in the Government Gazette.
('6', 390, 5, 11, 743993) Those who run eating houses therefore must take out licences.
('6', 390, 5, 12, 744055) It should be remembered that, if their kitchens and dining rooms are not found absolutely clean, they will not be issued a licence.
('6', 390, 6, 13, 744187) RUMOUR OF ASSENT TO NEW LAW A rumour was going the rounds here that Lord Elgin had approved the new law.
('6', 390, 6, 14, 744292) On an enquiry by the Association it was learnt that no such thing had happened and that the rumour was unfounded.
('6', 390, 6, 15, 744406) WARNING Great caution is necessary in this matter.
('6', 390, 6, 16, 744457) In spite of the tremendous efforts being made, Lord Elgin may after all append his signature to the law.
('6', 390, 6, 17, 744562) It is desirable therefore that those engaged in trade should take out a shopkeepers or hawkers licence for the whole year.
('6', 390, 6, 18, 744685) If they do that, their trade will not be affected at least this year even if the law should come into force.
('6', 390, 6, 19, 744794) If in the meanwhile gaol going is resorted to, the law cannot but be repealed ultimately.
('6', 390, 7, 20, 744884) CHINESE APPROVAL
('6', 390, 8, 21, 744901) The Chinese have sent a telegram to the Government saying that they are opposed to the law and that they approve of the Indian communitys proposal.
('6', 390, 9, 22, 745049) COMMENT BY THE RAND DAILY MAIL
('6', 390, 10, 23, 745080) On this, The Rand Daily Mail has made a good comment.
('6', 390, 10, 24, 745134) It says that now that the Chinese have endorsed the Indian proposal, all

('6', 391, 0, 1, 745261) 392 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 391, 1, 2, 745303) Asiatic communities can be said to have turned against the Act.
('6', 391, 1, 3, 745367) It behoved the Government, therefore, to accept the Indian proposal.
('6', 391, 1, 4, 745436) It was legitimate for the Indian community to object to the law, and its feelings should not be hurt.
('6', 391, 2, 5, 745538) REJOINDER TO CHAMNEY
('6', 391, 3, 6, 745559) The Rand Daily Mail has published a long rejoinder by the English editor of this paper to Mr. Report 1. It has been printed in the column next to the leader.
('6', 391, 3, 7, 745717) It will be published in two instalments.
('6', 391, 4, 8, 745758) OSMAN LATIEFS LETTER
('6', 391, 5, 9, 745779) Mr. Oman under the pen name of British Indian, has written a letter to the local Press, in which he has pointed out that the Indian community has taken out registers several times, that the objection based on competition in trade is untenable, and that justice must be done to the Indian community, keeping in view Queen Victorias assurances and those of others and the communitys own readiness to share in the defence of the British Empire.
('6', 391, 6, 10, 746221) CABLE TO COMMITTEE
('6', 391, 7, 11, 746240) A cable has been sent to the South Africa British Indian Committee communicating the Chinese approval [of the Indian proposal] and the support of The [Rand] Daily Mail, and inquiring about the state of the movement in England.

('6', 392, 1, 2, 746993) seems to be in order.
('6', 392, 1, 3, 747015) When the month was finished, 3 was debited to the Press and credited to Kaliandas, 4 debited to the Office and credited to Kaliandas.
('6', 392, 1, 4, 747149) Evidently, it should have been 4 against the Press and 3 against the Office, which will now be done.
('6', 392, 1, 5, 747250) Further, what has to be done here is to pass a debit against the Press of 1. These entries will be correct, if, at the time, you did not make any entries there, that is to say, if you did not credit Kaliandas independently of entries sent from here.
('6', 392, 1, 6, 747500) If you did, you will now have to make cross entries.
('6', 392, 1, 7, 747553) I assume also that no moneys passed from you to Kaliandas, because, in my ledger 7 has been credited to him.
('6', 392, 1, 8, 747662) I have now received the household account.
('6', 392, 1, 9, 747705) They seem to have spent money lavishly, and, yet, there is very little in detail I can take exception to.
('6', 392, 1, 10, 747811) I notice also that the piano has not yet been debited to me, unless I have overlooked it in going through it hurriedly, so that the amount will be increased by another 10. Is that so?
('6', 392, 1, 11, 747995) I am intensely dissatisfied with Gokaldas betrothal, for I understand that he has actually paid Rs. 2,000 in order to bring about the betrothal.
('6', 392, 1, 12, 748140) I do not know whether I have understood the thing correctly.
('6', 392, 1, 13, 748201) If it is in respect of jewellery, the matter is not so open to criticism.
('6', 392, 1, 14, 748275) I have meagre details about it.
('6', 392, 1, 15, 748307) If you know anything definite, I should like to know what has actually happened.
('6', 392, 2, 16, 748388) Yours sincerely,
('6', 392, 3, 17, 748405) M. K. GANDHI [PS.] I am sending you 3 numbers of The Times of India.
('6', 392, 3, 18, 748474) After you have seen and admired pictures I want you to cut out Gaekwar, the Jam, and the Cricket Team.
('6', 392, 3, 19, 748577) We might one of these days want to reproduce these pictures as supplements, and it would be better for you also to file any other pictures you may come across and consider good enough for use.

('6', 393, 1, 2, 748869) 347. LETTER TO LAKSHMIDAS GANDHI
('6', 393, 2, 3, 748902) [About April 20, 1907] 1
('6', 393, 3, 4, 748927) RESPECTED SIR,
('6', 393, 4, 5, 748942) I have received your letter.
('6', 393, 4, 6, 748971) I wish to answer it with the utmost calmness and as fully as possible.
('6', 393, 4, 7, 749042) I shall first put my thoughts before you as they come to my mind, and then answer your questions.
('6', 393, 4, 8, 749140) I am afraid our outlooks differ widely and I see no possibility, for the present, of their being reconciled.
('6', 393, 4, 9, 749249) You seek peace and happiness through money.
('6', 393, 4, 10, 749293) I dont depend on money for my peace; and for the moment at any rate my mind is quite calm and able to stand any amount of suffering.
('6', 393, 4, 11, 749426) Like you, I too believe in the old traditions, but there is a difference in our beliefs.
('6', 393, 4, 12, 749515) For you believe in age old superstitions, while I not only do not but consider it sinful to believe in them.
('6', 393, 4, 13, 749624) You desire to attain moksha 2, so do I. Nevertheless, your notion of that state seems to be widely different from mine.
('6', 393, 4, 14, 749744) Though I have the highest regard for you, untainted by any mean or selfish thought, you harbour hatred for me in your mind.
('6', 393, 4, 15, 749868) The reason for this, as I see it, is that you are overcome by attachment and maintain relationships for selfish ends.
('6', 393, 4, 16, 749986) Though you do this unconsciously, the result is practically the same as I have indicated.
('6', 393, 4, 17, 750076) If you have really got to the stage ofstriving for moksha, you should remain calm and unperturbed and forget all about me, even if I am extremely sinful and may be deceiving you.
('6', 393, 4, 18, 750255) But you are not able to do so because of your excessive attachment.
('6', 393, 4, 19, 750323) This is what I believe; but if I am wrong in holding this belief, I prostrate myself at your feet and beg to be forgiven.
('6', 393, 4, 20, 750445) But whether or not you are overcome by greed and attachment, I am not worried.
('6', 393, 4, 21, 750524) It does not affect my love for you.
('6', 393, 4, 22, 750560) My regard for you does not decrease in the least, and I am ready to render you any service that I can and look upon it as my duty.
('6', 393, 4, 23, 750691) I fail to understand what you mean by the word family.
('6', 393, 5, 24, 750746) 1 The original carries no date; however, vide the preceding item where Gandhiji refers to Gokuldass betrothal, while in this letter (Letter to Lakshmidas Gandhi, 20 4 1907) he refers to the forthcoming marriage.
('6', 393, 6, 25, 750958) 2 Liberation as the goal of life
('6', 394, 0, 1, 750991) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 395
('6', 394, 1, 2, 751035) me, the family includes not only the two brothers but the sister as well.
('6', 394, 1, 3, 751109) It also includes our cousins.
('6', 394, 1, 4, 751139) Indeed, if I could say so without arrogance, I would say that my family comprises all living beings: the only difference being that those who are more dependent on me, because of blood relationship or other circumstances, get more help from me.
('6', 394, 1, 5, 751384) Hence it was that I took out an insurance policy in my wifes favour.
('6', 394, 1, 6, 751453) And this I did because of your bitter letters to me when I was in Bombay and in order to escape your imprecations in case the responsibility for [supporting] my wife and children fell on you, as I was at that time engaged in helping the plague stricken.
('6', 394, 1, 7, 751707) Though I am myself against insurance, I took out an insurance policy for these and other reasons.
('6', 394, 1, 8, 751805) If by any chance you die before me, you may be sure that I shall myself [serve as] an insurance policy for your wife and children.
('6', 394, 1, 9, 751936) I beseech you to feel secure on this account.
('6', 394, 1, 10, 751982) I would cite the case of Raliatbehn in this context.
('6', 394, 1, 11, 752035) If Raliatbehn does not stay with you, I do not consider that to be due to any fault of mine, but hold your nature responsible.
('6', 394, 1, 12, 752162) I would humbly remind you that mother was not happy with you, nor at any time were any of the other relatives.
('6', 394, 1, 13, 752273) If Gokuldas and Harilal have gone astray, I am not responsible.
('6', 394, 1, 14, 752337) Gokuldas left me and was spoiled by the pernicious atmosphere there; the same thing happened with Harilal to some extent.
('6', 394, 1, 15, 752459) Nevertheless, neither of them has become as corrupt as you think.
('6', 394, 1, 16, 752525) They have better character than other boys.
('6', 394, 1, 17, 752569) It is only when I judge them by a standard of my own that I find them lacking.
('6', 394, 1, 18, 752648) Harilal has greatly profited by coming here and, if I mistake not, his character has improved.
('6', 394, 1, 19, 752743) Since Harilal is already betrothed, I have nothing to say against it.
('6', 394, 1, 20, 752813) At the same time I cannot say that I am pleased about it.
('6', 394, 1, 21, 752871) I consider it wrong too that Gokuldas is going to get married.
('6', 394, 1, 22, 752934) That it has become necessary for the two brothers to get married is due to the sensual atmosphere there.
('6', 394, 1, 23, 753039) It is not any dislike for the country but the grief I feel for its present sorry plight that prompts me to say this.
('6', 394, 1, 24, 753156) Fortunately, Manio 1, Ramo 2 and Devo 3 are here, and are growing up in a healthy atmosphere.
('6', 394, 1, 25, 753250) I do not therefore worry about their betrothal.
('6', 394, 1, 26, 753298) To my way of thinking, it is necessary for many Indians to
('6', 394, 2, 27, 753357) 1 Manilal, Ramdas and Devdas, Sons of Gandhiji 2 ibid 3 ibid
('6', 395, 0, 1, 753418) 396 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 395, 1, 2, 753460) observe brahmacharya, even if they get married.
('6', 395, 1, 3, 753508) If, therefore, all the three boys were to die unmarried, I shouldnt be sorry but should rejoice instead.
('6', 395, 1, 4, 753613) However, if when they come of age they wish to marry, I am sure that they will find suitable brides.
('6', 395, 1, 5, 753714) It would cause you great sorrow if I were to give my answer to the question, What is to be done if no girl is to be had from our caste?; so I would, with your permission, rather not answer this question.
('6', 395, 1, 6, 753918) I repeat that it is the divine law that one gets fruits according to ones faith and therefore this problem does not arise in my mind at all.
('6', 395, 2, 7, 754059) Chhaganlal, Maganlal and Anandlal are members of our family, hence service done to them is service done to the family.
('6', 395, 2, 8, 754178) They have become better men after coming to Phoenix and I see their moral sense developed.
('6', 395, 3, 9, 754269) As to your demand for a hundred rupees a month, I must say that I see neither the means at present nor the need of meeting it.
('6', 395, 3, 10, 754396) I run the Phoenix Press with borrowed money.
('6', 395, 3, 11, 754441) Moreover, I may have to go to gaol in the course of the struggle here against the new Ordinance.
('6', 395, 3, 12, 754538) In that case I may become poorer still.
('6', 395, 3, 13, 754578) This will come about in a month or two.
('6', 395, 3, 14, 754618) I am therefore unable at present to do anything to satisfy you.
('6', 395, 3, 15, 754682) If, however, the condition here improves during the next few months and I am free from trouble, I shall try to send you the money you have asked for by money order with the sole intention of pleasing you.
('6', 395, 3, 16, 754887) I do agree that you and Karsandas have [the right to] a share in my earnings.
('6', 395, 3, 17, 754965) But I spend much less on my personal enjoyment than you do [on yours].
('6', 395, 3, 18, 755036) My earnings are what remains after meeting all the charges here.
('6', 395, 3, 19, 755101) My object in staying here was not to make money but to serve the people; hence I deem it my duty to use for the benefit of the people whatever is left over after meeting the expen diture on the family here.
('6', 395, 3, 20, 755308) So please dont think that I am making money here.
('6', 395, 3, 21, 755358) At this point I would remind you that between you two brothers I have already paid nearly Rs. 60,000. I cleared all the debts while I was there; and you told me that no more money was wanted.
('6', 395, 3, 22, 755550) It was only after this that I began spending money here.
('6', 395, 3, 23, 755607) I handed over all my savings in Natal to you; and I have not kept a penny for myself either from that amount or from my subsequent earnings.
('6', 395, 3, 24, 755748) From this you will see that I have paid back much more than the Rs. 13,000 spent on me during my stay in England.
('6', 395, 3, 25, 755862) In saying this I do not mean to suggest
('6', 396, 0, 1, 755902) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 397
('6', 396, 1, 2, 755946) that I have done you a favour.
('6', 396, 1, 3, 755977) I only state the bare facts to pacify your anger.
('6', 396, 1, 4, 756027) What Mr. Fitzgerald told you about me only shows that he does not know the facts.
('6', 396, 1, 5, 756109) I shall now answer your questions 1. These I return herewith.
('6', 396, 1, 6, 756171) 1. The object of sending me to England was that we, all the three of us, might thereby maintain the status of our father more or less, be well off and enjoy the good things of life.
('6', 396, 1, 7, 756353) 2. The risk was indeed great as we had decided to stake whatever we had on my education.
('6', 396, 1, 8, 756442) 3. As those who had promised to help us did not keep their word, you worked hard, and even at the cost of your health, ungrudgi ngly gave me as much money as I asked for.
('6', 396, 1, 9, 756613) This shows your magn animity and your affection for a younger brother.
('6', 396, 1, 10, 756684) 4. When we were reduced to the condition described in this question, I did feelI vaguely recollectthat I would earn enough to satisfy you.
('6', 396, 1, 11, 756823) and make you forget the hardships you underwent for my sake.
('6', 396, 1, 12, 756884) 5. This I do not recollect, as father himself had started selling the property and we did the same after him.
('6', 396, 1, 13, 756994) 6. This is but natural.
('6', 396, 1, 14, 757018) 7. I must say with deep sorrow that, on account of your extravagant and thoughtless way of life, you have squandered a lot of money on pleasures and on pomp and show.
('6', 396, 1, 15, 757185) You kept a horse and carriage, gave parties, and spent money on selfish friends; and some money was spent in what I consider immoral ways.
('6', 396, 1, 16, 757324) 8. I remember to have sold them.
('6', 396, 1, 17, 757357) I am not at all ashamed of it, neither do I regret it.
('6', 396, 1, 18, 757412) 9. I do not remember to have sold them secretly without your knowledge; even if I had done so, I do not mind it.
('6', 396, 1, 19, 757525) 10. Though I did not replace that jewellery, I have already paid its value in cash and much more besides.
('6', 396, 1, 20, 757631) However, if I am required to do so [again], I shall certainly deposit the money in their names, that is, if I am able to save any.
('6', 396, 1, 21, 757762) As for getting the jewellery made afresh, I will not do so, as I consider it a sin.
('6', 396, 1, 22, 757846) When I refuse to get the jewellery
('6', 396, 2, 23, 757881) 1 Lakshmidass letter containing the questions is not available.
('6', 397, 0, 1, 757945) 398 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 397, 1, 2, 757987) made, it means that my ideas about such things have substantially changed.
('6', 397, 1, 3, 758062) 11. I do not consider that I have obliged you by doing this.
('6', 397, 1, 4, 758123) Even if nothing was done for me, whatever I have to do for my blood brother I would do as a matter of duty.
('6', 397, 1, 5, 758231) If then I do anything for one who spent a great deal on my account, it would be doubly my duty to do so.
('6', 397, 1, 6, 758336) 12. I am not the master of my earnings, since I have dedicated my all to the people.
('6', 397, 1, 7, 758421) I do not suffer from the illusion that it is I who earn; I simply believe that God gives me the money for making good use of it.
('6', 397, 1, 8, 758550) 13. I do recognize your [right to a] share in all my earnings; but since there is no such thing as an income for me now, what can I send you?
('6', 397, 1, 9, 758692) 14. I am not spending your share [on myself]; but I use all the money that God gives me for the public good.
('6', 397, 1, 10, 758801) If anything is left over after what has been used for this purpose, I would like to send you all of it, not just your share of it.
('6', 397, 1, 11, 758932) 15. I dont have the faintest recollection of having robbed you or anyone else.
('6', 397, 1, 12, 759011) If I regard all living beings as equal both from the practical and the moral points of view, it is in the fitness of things that those who are more dependent on me have a greater claim on me.
('6', 397, 1, 13, 759203) That is to say, I should help my wife and sons first and then those who are helpless and have therefore a claim on me.
('6', 397, 1, 14, 759322) If, on the other hand, my wife and sons find their means of living independently of me, they may be left alone and others who are helpless anddepend on me will have precedence.
('6', 397, 1, 15, 759499) This means that Goko 1, if he were not earning, would have a prior claim to Hariyos 2 if the latter were earning.
('6', 397, 1, 16, 759613) If all of them are earning and you are not, yours will be the first claim.
('6', 397, 1, 17, 759688) Moreover, if all of you were working, but Purshottam was not and he were still with us, his would be the first claim.
('6', 397, 1, 18, 759806) This claim pertains only to maintenance and not to the illusory worldly pleasures.
('6', 397, 1, 19, 759889) Whatever other questions of a subsidiary nature arise out of the above, you will be able to answer for yourself.
('6', 397, 1, 20, 760002) All this is written without any bad motive whatever.
('6', 397, 1, 21, 760055) 16. The answer to this question is contained in the previous one.

('6', 398, 0, 1, 760164) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 399
('6', 398, 1, 2, 760208) 17. I have no objection whatever to your showing this letter or any portion of it to anyone you like.
('6', 398, 1, 3, 760310) I do not know who should judge as between us.
('6', 398, 1, 4, 760356) I am at your command.
('6', 398, 1, 5, 760378) I am in no way your equal and no one therefore can compare us and pronounce judgement.
('6', 398, 1, 6, 760465) However, I shall hear what those to whom you show this letter have to say and shall reply to them according to my lights.
('6', 398, 1, 7, 760587) I revere you as you are my elder brother.
('6', 398, 1, 8, 760629) Our religion bids us treat our elders with veneration.
('6', 398, 1, 9, 760684) I implicitly believe in that injunction.
('6', 398, 1, 10, 760725) But I have greater regard for truth.
('6', 398, 1, 11, 760762) This too is taught by our religion.
('6', 398, 1, 12, 760798) If you find anything objectionable in what I say, please accept my assurance that I have answered all your questions with the greatest regard for truth, and not in order to hurt you or be rude.
('6', 398, 1, 13, 760992) Formerly, there was no difference of opinion or misunderstanding between us, hence you had affection for me.
('6', 398, 1, 14, 761101) Now you have turned away from me because my views have changed, as I have said.
('6', 398, 1, 15, 761181) Since you consider this change has been for the worse, I can quite understand that some of my answers will not be acceptable to you.
('6', 398, 1, 16, 761314) But as the change in my ideas is due to my pursuit of truth, I am quite helpless.
('6', 398, 1, 17, 761396) My devotion to you remains the same as before; it has simply assumed a new form.
('6', 398, 1, 18, 761477) All this I shall explain to you most humbly and at length some day when we meet and if you want me to tell you about it.
('6', 398, 1, 19, 761598) But I am unable to say when I can leave this country because of the peculiar circumstances and my several obligations here.
('6', 398, 1, 20, 761722) Do please believe me when I say that I have written all this with the best of intentions.
('6', 398, 1, 21, 761812) If you do that, your displeasure will cease.
('6', 398, 1, 22, 761857) Wherever you think that I am erring, please bear with me.
('6', 398, 1, 23, 761915) I have shared your letter with Hariyo, because, after all, whatever you may think, we both belong to the older generation, and though you write with extreme indignation .
('6', 398, 1, 24, 762086) 1 it shows the true nature .
('6', 398, 1, 25, 762115) 2 to leave me.
('6', 398, 1, 26, 762130) And I am getting him to copy this letter so that you may have no difficulty in reading it and he may know how I have answered your angry letter and may learn whatever he can from it according to his karma 3.

('6', 399, 3, 5, 762870) I should like to know, if possible, how much each of your two sons weighs.
('6', 399, 3, 6, 762945) I would particularly advise you to see that the childs bed and other linen are quite clean.
('6', 399, 3, 7, 763037) Do not allow the useless and wicked superstitions about untouchability to come in your way.
('6', 399, 3, 8, 763129) Use a cradle in preference to a hammock.
('6', 399, 3, 9, 763170) I would like your son to be as healthy as Mrs. Polaks.
('6', 399, 3, 10, 763225) Please ask Thakkar to translate the speech read by Mr. Fitzgerald on the occasion of Ranjit Singhs accession to the gadi and the latters reply which are [both] reported in The Times of India.
('6', 399, 3, 11, 763417) Please reproduce these in English also if possible.
('6', 399, 3, 12, 763469) Both are good.
('6', 399, 3, 13, 763484) There is an article about us in one of the issues of that paper; please get a cutting and send it to me.
('6', 399, 3, 14, 763589) I forgot to take one myself.
('6', 399, 3, 15, 763618) Please let me know how you are faring there.
('6', 399, 3, 16, 763663) How do you feel in your mind?
('6', 399, 3, 17, 763693) How do you find yourself in relation to West?
('6', 399, 3, 18, 763739) What do you think about your going [to England]?
('6', 399, 4, 19, 763788) Blessings from
('6', 399, 5, 20, 763803) MOHANDAS [PS.] I am sending some Gujarati matter today.
('6', 399, 5, 21, 763859) There must be some overflow matter from last week.
('6', 399, 5, 22, 763910) I sent some on Saturday, that is, yesterday 2 and hope to send more tomorrow.
('6', 399, 5, 23, 763988) You did well to send me the Maratha, but according to our arrangement, you ought to have passed it on to Thakkar for translation.
('6', 399, 5, 24, 764118) However, if that is what you are already doing but have sent this particular issue to me for translation, I have nothing to say.

('6', 400, 3, 4, 764576) MY DEAR KALIANDAS, I have not heard from you at all for some time.
('6', 400, 3, 5, 764643) Do wake up.
('6', 400, 3, 6, 764655) I enclose herewith the Deed of Transfer No.

('6', 400, 3, 8, 764833) I am, therefore, sending it to you there, and, if there is a call for it, hand it over after taking a receipt.
('6', 400, 3, 9, 764944) Inquire also why it is wanted.

('6', 400, 7, 13, 765071) JOHANNESBURG, April 26, 1907
('6', 400, 8, 14, 765100) MY DEAR CHHAGANLAL, I have your letter.
('6', 400, 8, 15, 765140) With reference to the Madressa, it is not possible for us to give any independent opinion.
('6', 400, 8, 16, 765231) How can we?
('6', 400, 8, 17, 765243) All we can do is to bring out the best points in the report, which I have done.
('6', 400, 8, 18, 765323) I have given a note on Al Islam 2 also.
('6', 400, 8, 19, 765363) I suppose Apoo has asked for the money for the firm.
('6', 400, 8, 20, 765416) I have not said anything .
('6', 400, 8, 21, 765443) 3 because I wanted you to use your discretion.
('6', 400, 8, 22, 765490) I have telegraphed today saying that Kalyandas must prepare to leave immediately.
('6', 400, 8, 23, 765572) I have a peremptory letter from his father.
('6', 400, 8, 24, 765616) He should, therefore, go.
('6', 400, 8, 25, 765642) You will perhaps read my letter to Mr. West, wherein I have suggested that Maganlal should replace Kalyandas.
('6', 400, 8, 26, 765752) I am likely to be there before he leaves.
('6', 400, 8, 27, 765794) All that I have said before regarding him is applicable today also.
('6', 400, 8, 28, 765862) I have received all the cuttings mentioned by you.
('6', 400, 8, 29, 765913) I am sending under cover to you the Jaina.
('6', 400, 8, 30, 765956) I want Harilal to read it and make

('6', 401, 1, 3, 766172) It seems to me that it is a very ably edited paper.
('6', 401, 1, 4, 766224) I have been receiving it regularly for the last twelve months, and each cursory glance through [it] made me think the more highly of it.
('6', 401, 1, 5, 766361) You will see the manner in which news are condensed and given in its columns.
('6', 401, 1, 6, 766439) I think that the language also is very good.
('6', 401, 1, 7, 766484) I used to send it to the Indian Public Library directly, but, this time, there are so many things of importance in it that I send it for Indian Opinion use first, and then, if it is not cut about, you can send it to the library.
('6', 401, 1, 8, 766713) Directions about taking some portions of it are given in my letter to Harilal.
('6', 401, 1, 9, 766792) Do you want me to write to D. Ebrahim Ismail regarding the fifty copies?
('6', 401, 1, 10, 766865) For the present, as I have already suggested, even at the risk of having a few copies left unsold, it will be better to print extra copies, because one never knows when there will be a good demand, which we ought to be in a position to meet.
('6', 401, 1, 11, 767107) I have already suggested to you that you should read the Islam Gazette carefully, so that we may not duplicate the information.
('6', 401, 1, 12, 767235) I remind you again, because I put that paper, also, in [as] fairly edited, though for condensation and choice of matter, it cannot stand comparison with the Jaina.
('6', 401, 1, 13, 767399) I am glad both the babies 1 and their mothers are progressing.
('6', 401, 2, 14, 767462) Please read my letter to Mr. West, wherein I have written about inviting Omar Sheth.
('6', 401, 2, 15, 767547) We should give him [a send off] in the same style as we had given Rustomji Sheth.

('6', 401, 6, 19, 767708) Lord Milner has written an article about the Colonial Confer ence from which we publish elsewhere an extract relating to Indians.
('6', 401, 6, 20, 767838) It is clear from this that there is commotion everywhere over the hardships of Indians in South Africa.
('6', 401, 6, 21, 767942) To Lord Milners way of thinking, India is more valuable than the Colonies, and if ever a

('6', 402, 1, 2, 768254) question arose as to whether the British should lose the Colonies or India, they would decide to give up the Colonies rather than India.
('6', 402, 1, 3, 768391) But it is in our hands to decide when such an eventuality should arise.
('6', 402, 1, 4, 768463) If we could rid ourselves of all our shortcomings, then such a situation can be said already to exist.
('6', 402, 1, 5, 768566) So long as the officials can persuade [the British people] that we shall put up with any amount of suffering, they will believe in the Colonies and the burden on the Indian people will increase.
('6', 402, 1, 6, 768761) This is the way of the world.
('6', 402, 1, 7, 768791) The rich grow richer, the poor poorer.
('6', 402, 1, 8, 768830) The burden on those who carry it increases and those who do not carry any go unscathed.
('6', 402, 1, 9, 768918) The moral is that we have to let the Government know that we in the Colony will not stand any more burden.
('6', 402, 1, 10, 769025) Lord Milner also adds that India is vital to the entire English nation as well as the Colonies.
('6', 402, 1, 11, 769121) Its value is immeasurable.
('6', 402, 1, 12, 769148) Why should it not be so?
('6', 402, 1, 13, 769173) Her revenues total 44 million (a million = 10 lakhs).
('6', 402, 1, 14, 769227) Out of this 22 million are spent on the military depart ment, that is, a major portion of this amount is spent in paying the salaries of the British soldiers and buying British goods.
('6', 402, 1, 15, 769411) A third part of the 44 million, that is, about15 million goes straight to England.
('6', 402, 1, 16, 769494) Only the balance remains in India.
('6', 402, 1, 17, 769529) This means that in the partnership between the British and the Indians 83 per cent.
('6', 402, 1, 18, 769613) of the profit goes to the British and 17 per cent.
('6', 402, 1, 19, 769664) to the Indians, but the entire capital comes from the Indians.
('6', 402, 1, 20, 769727) Such a partnership is evidently advantageous to the British.
('6', 402, 1, 21, 769788) Let us now turn to the Colonies.
('6', 402, 1, 22, 769821) Here, all the capital is provided by the British but the profit is consumed by the Colonies.
('6', 402, 1, 23, 769914) If anyone asks the reason of this one sided justice, the only reply is that the Colonies being strong have the lions share.
('6', 402, 1, 24, 770038) They can stand up to England.
('6', 402, 1, 25, 770068) If we become as strong as they, we too shall get justice.
('6', 402, 1, 26, 770126) A closed mouth catches no flies; that is the policy of the British.
('6', 402, 1, 27, 770194) But speaking does not mean mere shouting.
('6', 402, 1, 28, 770236) It must be accompanied by kicking.
('6', 402, 1, 29, 770271) The way we can kick in South Africa or in India is to go to gaol.
('6', 402, 1, 30, 770337) If we do not help in the oppression that is being perpetrated on us, we shall be free.

('6', 403, 2, 3, 770613) Malaria is still raging among Indians.
('6', 403, 2, 4, 770652) To deal with this, a committee has been formed with Dr. Nanji as Chairman and is being assisted by Indians.
('6', 403, 2, 5, 770760) The daily average of patients is expected to be a hundred, and the daily expenditure 4, that is, less than a shilling per head.
('6', 403, 2, 6, 770888) In view of the fact that, in addition to medicine, soup and other articles will have to be supplied to some of the patients, the expen diture of 4 a day cannot be considered excessive.
('6', 403, 2, 7, 771073) It is necessary that the leaders help in this work sincerely.

('6', 403, 6, 12, 771289) WHAT TRUE PATRIOTISM IS
('6', 403, 7, 13, 771313) There is far too much of self centredness or selfishness in India today.
('6', 403, 7, 14, 771386) Instead we should have concern for the nation, that is to say, be patriotic.
('6', 403, 7, 15, 771463) But since we are out to improve existing conditions, we should bear in mind that concern for national interest does not imply hatred of others.
('6', 403, 7, 16, 771607) Before we can hate others, we should get tothe stage of being able to safeguard our national interest.
('6', 403, 7, 17, 771710) There is hardly any immediate fear therefore of our hating foreign countries.
('6', 403, 7, 18, 771788) However, what Sir William Wedderburn has written on the subject is worth reading and reflecting on.
('6', 403, 7, 19, 771888) We give below a summary of his article in The Indian Review.
('6', 403, 8, 20, 771949) There are some people in India today who believe that they should not approach the British Government for the redress of their grievances, for they fear that, if by any chance the British do redress their grievances, it will tighten their hold over the country, which will endanger our patriotism.
('6', 403, 8, 21, 772247) This is a mistaken idea.
('6', 403, 8, 22, 772272) Those who offer such advice seek to take upon their heads the sins of the Englishmen, who, priding themselves upon the colour of their skin, oppress Indians.
('6', 403, 8, 23, 772430) This [idea] is moreover

('6', 404, 1, 2, 772592) opposed to the movement afoot all over the world for peace and amity among mankind.
('6', 404, 1, 3, 772676) Even if one replaced self interest by the national interest, one would violate the highest morality.
('6', 404, 1, 4, 772777) If a man wants to become virtuous and remain so, he will keep the highest morality in mind.
('6', 404, 1, 5, 772869) And though he may not be able to act up to it, he must always aim high.
('6', 404, 1, 6, 772941) He whose aim is not true will never hit his target.
('6', 404, 1, 7, 772993) We should always try to climb higher in spite of our shortcomings.
('6', 404, 1, 8, 773060) And this applies as much to a group or a community as to an individual Again, it applies with added force to India for, at present, she is considering what policy, what standard of conduct, she should adopt.
('6', 404, 1, 9, 773268) To serve ones own interest is low indeed; to serve the interest of the nation is to rise a step higher.
('6', 404, 1, 10, 773372) He who gives up his life for his nation is considered a great man; but when the interest of the world at large is made to suffer in the nations interest, then [serving] the latter must be considered mean and degrading.
('6', 404, 1, 11, 773591) If we wish to see peace and goodwill established throughout the world, we should remember that our personal and national interests are served by the well being of the whole world.
('6', 404, 1, 12, 773771) The Indian people have suffered a lot during the last few years because Englishmen who pride themselves on their patriotism pursued only their self interest.
('6', 404, 1, 13, 773929) Do Indian leaders wish to imitate these selfish English people?
('6', 404, 1, 14, 773993) Do they hate the sinners but love the sin?
('6', 404, 1, 15, 774036) They should not become the dupes of this temptation.
('6', 404, 1, 16, 774089) The real enemies of freedom and prosperity are the autocratic and tyrannical powers; not the differences of race or colour.
('6', 404, 1, 17, 774213) Though the Russians have their own government, it is oppressive and is as bad as that of India.
('6', 404, 1, 18, 774309) The remedy for such a situation is the getting together of good and altruistic people, wherever they be in the world.
('6', 404, 1, 19, 774427) It is therefore necessary to bring together the English reformers who are strong and Indian reformers who are weak.
('6', 404, 1, 20, 774543) With the relations that prevail at present between England and India, such a meeting can easily be brought about.
('6', 404, 1, 21, 774657) But the relations between the two countries have to be placed on a foundation of justice.
('6', 404, 1, 22, 774747) The idea that the British are the masters and the Indians the servants must go.
('6', 404, 1, 23, 774827) If this happens, England and India can stay together, befriend the world and work for the good of mankind.

('6', 405, 1, 3, 775134) They have held three bases in India since then, [together] known as French India.
('6', 405, 1, 4, 775216) They are Chandrana gore, Pondicherry and Calicut 1. It is often said that the French have a very sympathetic attitude towards Indians.
('6', 405, 1, 5, 775351) An example of this was seen recently when the Governor of Pondicherry addressed the following letter to the Indians there: Citizens, I shall soon be there to see you and your country.
('6', 405, 1, 6, 775535) I shall inspect your farms and bunds and hear your petitions.
('6', 405, 1, 7, 775597) You may come to me with full confidence.
('6', 405, 1, 8, 775638) A repres entative of the Republic is bound to regard all [citizens] as equals and there is only one thing between us, viz., the laws.
('6', 405, 1, 9, 775772) I will give you whatever [relief] I can under those laws; and Ishall explain their limitations to you quite clearly.
('6', 405, 1, 10, 775889) Please do not ask me unnecessary or frivolous questions, for the time lost in answering them can be better used to solve more important problems.
('6', 405, 1, 11, 776035) You are engaged in your agricultural work.
('6', 405, 1, 12, 776078) I have also many jobs to attend to.
('6', 405, 1, 13, 776114) So we have no time to meet in a grand hall and receive garlands of roses and jasmines.
('6', 405, 1, 14, 776201) Believe me when I say that I shall come to see you without pomp or show.
('6', 405, 1, 15, 776274) And I shall be glad if I meet you in simplicity.
('6', 405, 1, 16, 776323) If I meet you while you are at work, I shall get to know you the better and be able to see for myself and redress your grievances.

('6', 406, 4, 10, 777621) WHAT WILL BE OUTCOME?
('6', 406, 5, 11, 777643) Because of the foregoing and the Committees letter, there is reason to believe that the Bill will receive assent.
('6', 406, 5, 12, 777757) If this happens, it is clear that gaol going will be the only remedy left.
('6', 406, 5, 13, 777832) I hear, the gaol going resolution was once being discussed in the presence of a white official, and he laughed and said, I dont at all believe, the Indian community will act up to such resolutions. This rem ark should be taken very seriously.
('6', 406, 5, 14, 778075) There is no doubt at all that the Indian community has no reputation for bravery and that is why the whites dare to pass any laws they like with impunity.
('6', 406, 5, 15, 778230) If the Bill becomes law and we give up the idea of gaol going, the Indian comm unity, we may take it, is doomed for ever.
('6', 406, 5, 16, 778352) The white officials derisive laugh shows that, if the whites had taken our gaol going resolution seriously, they would never have introduced the Bill again.
('6', 406, 5, 17, 778509) Now is the time to prove that we mean what we say.
('6', 406, 5, 18, 778560) We have read about the boy who used to cry wolf.
('6', 406, 5, 19, 778609) People would rush to his help and, finding no wolf, go back irritated.
('6', 406, 5, 20, 778680) When a wolf did appear, however much the boy shouted, his neighbours took it for a joke, refused to go to his help, and the boy was killed.
('6', 406, 5, 21, 778820) It is now absolutely necessary to show that our cries are genuine.
('6', 406, 6, 22, 778887) SOME DOUBTS CLARIFIED
('6', 406, 7, 23, 778909) Though great efforts are being made to prevent the Bill becoming law, we have to be prepared on the assumption that it will
('6', 407, 0, 1, 779033) 408 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 407, 1, 2, 779075) be passed.
('6', 407, 1, 3, 779086) Questions have been asked from many quarters.
('6', 407, 1, 4, 779132) I give below a clarification of the important questions raised.
('6', 407, 1, 5, 779196) It has to be borne in mind that the whole struggle is on behalf of those who hold genuine permits, and those who are not thus equipped should therefore certainly leave the Transvaal.
('6', 407, 1, 6, 779379) The pre war residents and others, who have come after the war but hold genuine permits, have to put up a fight.
('6', 407, 1, 7, 779491) Nobody can do the boys any harm.
('6', 407, 1, 8, 779524) This point clarified, the important thing to understand is how the struggle is to be waged.
('6', 407, 1, 9, 779616) In this regard we would say [the following]: 1. It is improbable that all the persons [who do not take out permits] will be sent to gaol or that they will all be taken to gaol at once.
('6', 407, 1, 10, 779801) 2. After the law is passed, an order will be published requiring permits to be renewed within a specified period.
('6', 407, 1, 11, 779915) 3. No Indian should get his permit renewed within that period.
('6', 407, 1, 12, 779978) 4. At the expiry of the period, the Government can arrest any person, if they choose, for residing in the Transvaal without a permit.
('6', 407, 1, 13, 780112) 5. It cannot be said for certain who will be arrested and where.
('6', 407, 1, 14, 780177) 6. Suppose, a poor Indian is arrested.
('6', 407, 1, 15, 780216) If he holds a lawful permit, Mr. Gandhi, as he declared last September, will defend him in the court free of charge.
('6', 407, 1, 16, 780333) 7. At the time Mr. Gandhi himself will say that he had advised the entire community not to take out permits as required by the new law but instead to go to gaol in all humility, and that was why his client had not taken out a fresh permit.
('6', 407, 1, 17, 780573) 8. When the counsel himself says this, it is possible that the defaulter may be set free and the counsel arrested.
('6', 407, 1, 18, 780688) That is, Mr. Gandhi will be arrested and his client let off.
('6', 407, 1, 19, 780749) At that time, a similar deposition will!
('6', 407, 1, 20, 780790) if possible, be made on behalf of the Association also.
('6', 407, 1, 21, 780846) 9. However, it is possible that the arrested person may himself be sentenced.
('6', 407, 1, 22, 780924) In that case, the first punishment may be that he will be asked to leave the Colony within a specified time.
('6', 407, 1, 23, 781033) 10. At the expiry of the time limit, the person will be re arrested and sentenced to fine or imprisonment for disobeying the courts order.
('6', 407, 1, 24, 781172) 11. As the person concerned will refuse to pay the fine, he will have to go to gaol.
('6', 407, 1, 25, 781257) 12. If many persons are thus prosecuted and all of them go to gaol, the chances are that they will be soon released and the law amended
('6', 408, 0, 1, 781393) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 409
('6', 408, 1, 2, 781437) suitably.
('6', 408, 1, 3, 781447) 13. It is possible that, if such a person does not leave the Colony after being released from gaol, he will be sent back to gaol.
('6', 408, 1, 4, 781577) 14. The wife and children of a person so going to gaol will, if necessary, be maintained on subscriptions from the public.
('6', 408, 1, 5, 781700) This, in brief, is likely to be the position.
('6', 408, 1, 6, 781746) In fact, the step [proposed] is not at all dangerous.
('6', 408, 1, 7, 781800) AS shopkeepers and hawkers will have taken out their licences for the whole year, they will have no difficulty in carrying on their business.
('6', 408, 1, 8, 781942) A shopkeeper can entrust his shop to any other person and himself enjoy life in gaol.
('6', 408, 1, 9, 782028) For hawkers there will be no difficulty at all.
('6', 408, 1, 10, 782076) I know from experience that many of them have been living such a miserable life that they will be much better off in gaol.
('6', 408, 1, 11, 782199) There is no disgrace attached to going to gaol on this occasion; on the contrary, it will positively add to ones prestige.
('6', 408, 1, 12, 782322) There is no need, therefore, for anyone to take fright or lose courage.
('6', 408, 1, 13, 782394) As I said in an earlier letter 1, if anyone has any questions to ask in this matter, he should address them directly to the Editor, P.O. Box No.
('6', 408, 1, 14, 782539) 6522, Johannesburg, so that the replies can be published in these columns.
('6', 408, 1, 15, 782614) Meanwhile, I would appeal to all Indians to note that this gaol going is a great adventure, and that no Indian must retract.
('6', 408, 1, 16, 782739) Else it will be like losing a battle already won.
('6', 408, 2, 17, 782789) HOW BAD THESE INDIANS ARE !
('6', 408, 3, 18, 782817) With reference to the strong criticism of Mr. Chamneys Report made by the editor of this paper in The Rand Daily Mail a white from Leydenburg, under the pen name Just, has written an unjust letter, in which he says: All the seven days in the week are working days for the Indians and they work from sunrise to sunset.
('6', 408, 3, 19, 783135) On Sundays they write up their account books and hawkers settle their accounts.
('6', 408, 3, 20, 783215) Others either keep the shop open on holidays blatantly or station a man outside to smuggle customers in.
('6', 408, 3, 21, 783320) Moreover, Indian merchants in rural areas examine samples brought by agents on Sundays so that the latter too can work all the days in the week.
('6', 408, 3, 22, 783465) The Indians know nothing about making payments on time.
('6', 408, 3, 23, 783521) It is the usual practice with them to turn a 90 day credit into one for 150 days.
('6', 408, 3, 24, 783603) It is not unusual for them to settle a creditors account by paying him only a part of his dues.
('6', 408, 3, 25, 783699) There are countless

('6', 409, 1, 2, 783800) insolvent Indians carrying on business in their own names or in those of their relatives.
('6', 409, 1, 3, 783890) The intelligence they show in the use of pleas while purchasing goods [on credit] is equalled only by the denseness they feign in explaining away their insolvency.
('6', 409, 1, 4, 784054) Ninety five percent of all Indian trade is corrupt.
('6', 409, 1, 5, 784106) An Indian will not lose a customer and will sell him goods even at a loss, for the loss is to be suffered not by him, but by his creditor.
('6', 409, 1, 6, 784245) Traders who deal with such Indians are of course no less to blame.
('6', 409, 1, 7, 784312) Only if, follo wing the example of the Orange River Colony, the Transvaal too closes down Indian shops with or without compensation, will clean trade be possible for European traders in towns such as Standerton, Heidelberg, Ermilom and Klerksdorp.
('6', 409, 1, 8, 784560) Referring to this letter, the editor of The [Rand Daily] Mail says that, if what Just says is all true, one fails to see how so many Europeans trade with Indians.
('6', 409, 1, 9, 784723) Thus the letter by Just has already been answered.
('6', 409, 1, 10, 784774) But while some of his criticism is unduly exaggerated, it will only be fitting that we admit the force of much of it.
('6', 409, 1, 11, 784892) We work day and night, do not rest even on Sundays, fail to keep promises and settle accounts by making only part payments to creditors.
('6', 409, 1, 12, 785029) There is no doubt we should effect improvements in these four matters.
('6', 409, 1, 13, 785100) We need an innate sense of honour, and, as His Majesty the Amir advised, it is essential for us to have western education.
('6', 409, 1, 14, 785223) 1 There are nowadays any number of associat ions.
('6', 409, 1, 15, 785273) If a well known merchant founds an Association for the Reform of the Trading Class and brings about the much needed reforms, many of our disabilities will disappear and the stringent licence regulations will also go.
('6', 409, 2, 16, 785490) DIVINE WRATH
('6', 409, 3, 17, 785503) These days the tram service in Johannesburg often becomes dislocated.
('6', 409, 3, 18, 785573) Hardly a day passes without a break down.
('6', 409, 3, 19, 785615) There can be two reasons for this.
('6', 409, 3, 20, 785650) The Indian community may persuade itself that it results from Gods wrath on the municipality which prohibits Coloured persons from travelling by these trams.
('6', 409, 3, 21, 785808) Another reason may be that those entrusted with the installation of electric motors have, for the sake of money, cheated and not done their work according to the contract.

('6', 410, 11, 17, 786844) REGISTRATION LAW
('6', 410, 12, 18, 786861) The Rand Daily Mail hasfor the present at any ratecome to the rescue of Indians.
('6', 410, 12, 19, 786942) Two leading articles appeared during the last week.
('6', 410, 12, 20, 786994) Commenting upon Lord Milners article in the National Review, The Rand Daily Mail pointed out that the Colonies could not carry on without the other parts of the British Empire.
('6', 410, 12, 21, 787171) For example, the trade of New South Wales in Australia with India is valued at 1 million a year.
('6', 410, 12, 22, 787268) Its trade with Ceylon is even larger.
('6', 410, 12, 23, 787306) Its exports to India exceed her exports to New Zealand and her exports to Ceylon are larger than those to South Africa.
('6', 410, 12, 24, 787426) The article shows that the Colonies cannot do without India.
('6', 410, 12, 25, 787487) The liberation of India will come about as soon as Indians wake up and become conscious of their rights.
('6', 410, 12, 26, 787592) As far as the Transvaal is concerned, the remedy lies in our own hands: it is to go to gaol if the registration law is passed.
('6', 410, 12, 27, 787719) The second article in The Rand Daily Mail has greater relevance to the registration law than the first one.
('6', 410, 12, 28, 787827) The writer says that the
('6', 411, 0, 1, 787852) 412 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 411, 1, 2, 787894) present Asiatic Office seems to serve no purpose.
('6', 411, 1, 3, 787944) Its report shows that the Office has proved a failure.
('6', 411, 1, 4, 787999) Though it has several clerks, inspec tors and liveried peons, Indians can enter without permits.
('6', 411, 1, 5, 788096) Though over 4,000 are paid by it every year on account of salaries, it is said that all the power is concentrated in the hands of a single Eurasian clerk.
('6', 411, 1, 6, 788251) If this is so, one cannot see the point of spending 4,000 on the Asiatic Office; it would be better to entrust everything to that clerk.
('6', 411, 1, 7, 788388) In fact, the permit problem is one of adequate police vigilance, not of enacting a new law.
('6', 411, 1, 8, 788480) The Rand Daily Mail has thus strongly criticised and roundly condemned the Asiatic Office.
('6', 411, 1, 9, 788571) It would appear then that the Office is viewed with disfavour by others as well.
('6', 411, 2, 10, 788652) MEETING IN ENGLAND
('6', 411, 3, 11, 788671) A cable received here states that the meeting 1 of the Members of the House of Commons took place on Wednesday, the 24th.
('6', 411, 3, 12, 788793) Sir Henry Cotton took the chair.
('6', 411, 3, 13, 788826) Mr. Cox and other Members spoke.
('6', 411, 3, 14, 788859) It was decided to have interviews with Mr. Morley and General Botha.
('6', 411, 3, 15, 788928) I am writing this on Sunday.
('6', 411, 3, 16, 788957) More news is expected on Tuesday.
('6', 411, 4, 17, 788991) ASIATIC BAZAAR
('6', 411, 5, 18, 789006) The authority to control Asiatic Bazaars or Locations has been vested in the respective municipalities.
('6', 411, 5, 19, 789110) For the present this has little significance, as there exists no law compelling Indians to go to Locations.
('6', 411, 5, 20, 789218) But it should be remembered that, if the Indian community submits to the new law, another law will be passed immediately forcing Indians to Locations, and then the municipal authority will prove very troublesome.
('6', 411, 6, 21, 789431) MEETING OF SOUTH AFRICAN CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE
('6', 411, 7, 22, 789477) The twelfth annual meeting of the Chambers of Commerce of South Africa took place on the 24th at Pretoria, when Mr. Mackintosh of Port Elizabeth presided.
('6', 411, 7, 23, 789632) Mr. Prady of Germiston moved a resolution to the effect that Asiatics should be prevented from coming [into the Colony] and their trade stopped.
('6', 411, 7, 24, 789777) He said in his speech that great harm was done by Indian trade as the whites could not compete with Indian traders.
('6', 411, 7, 25, 789893) The whites had struggled hard in South Africa for a hundred years.
('6', 411, 7, 26, 789960) How could Indians be allowed to oust them?
('6', 411, 8, 27, 790003) 1 Vide Johannesburg Letter, 27 4 1907.
('6', 412, 0, 1, 790042) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 413
('6', 412, 1, 2, 790086) Conditions in Standerton, Heidelberg, Potchefstroom and other places had deteriorated very much.
('6', 412, 1, 3, 790183) If the influx of Indians could not be stopped forthwith, he said, they should be so heavily taxed that they could not afford to stay on.
('6', 412, 1, 4, 790320) According to him, it would be better to drive out the existing traders, even after paying them compensation, if necessary.
('6', 412, 1, 5, 790443) Mr. Hobson of Maseru, who supported him, said that Indian traders had penetrated far into Basutoland and had captured most of the trade.
('6', 412, 1, 6, 790580) However, according to him, Mr. Pradys resolution for winding up Indian business immediately was too drastic.
('6', 412, 1, 7, 790689) Sir William Van Hulsteyn said that all South Africa was opposed to Indians.
('6', 412, 1, 8, 790765) But it was not proper to drive them out all at once or to discontinue their trade; it would be better to insist on their carrying on business in Bazaars only.
('6', 412, 1, 9, 790924) The question of immigration did not concern the Chambers of Commerce, and hence they could not interfere in the matter.
('6', 412, 1, 10, 791044) He moved an amendment to the effect that it was necessary immediately to frame laws on Asiatic trade for the whole of South Africa.
('6', 412, 2, 11, 791176) Mr. Quinn supported the amendment.
('6', 412, 2, 12, 791211) Mr. Henderson of Natal said that the Indian merchants had brought ruin to Natal.
('6', 412, 2, 13, 791292) In Ladys mith and other places the entire trade had passed into their hands.
('6', 412, 2, 14, 791369) Like locusts they devoured Natal.
('6', 412, 2, 15, 791403) They caused harm to the Kaffirs also for the latter were powerless against them.
('6', 412, 3, 16, 791484) Mr. Jagger of Cape Town said that he too was opposed to Indians, but that sudden and complete prohibition was a difficult task.
('6', 412, 3, 17, 791612) The Imperial Government would never assent to such laws.
('6', 412, 3, 18, 791669) He therefore moved that, since the presence of the Indian community was detrimental to [the interests of] South Africa, immediate legisla tion was necessary to restrict their immigration and trade.
('6', 412, 4, 19, 791867) Mr. Ireland of Zoutpansburg said that Mr. Pradys resolution went too far.
('6', 412, 4, 20, 791941) It was certainly necessary to adopt quick measures in the matter.
('6', 412, 4, 21, 792007) The Asiatics were like the plague.
('6', 412, 4, 22, 792042) Mr. Forest said that he shuddered to think of the number of Indians in Natal.
('6', 412, 4, 23, 792120) Mr. Chappel of Pretoria supported the amendment.
('6', 412, 4, 24, 792169) Mr. Burke suggested to Mr. Prady that he ought to withdraw his resolution so that the amendment, being unanimously passed, would carry due weight.
('6', 412, 4, 25, 792316) Mr. Prady withdrew his resolution and the amended resolution was unanimously carried.
('6', 412, 5, 26, 792402) Then a discussion took place on the subject of the Dealers
('6', 413, 0, 1, 792461) 414 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 413, 1, 2, 792503) Licenses Act.
('6', 413, 1, 3, 792517) It was resolved that all Colonies should pass laws similar to that in force in the Cape, with local variations as necessary.
('6', 413, 2, 4, 792642) AKIKO OF HASANMIANS SON
('6', 413, 3, 5, 792666) A son has been born to Sheth Hasanmian, a partner of the firm of Sheth Mahomed Cassim Camroodeen.
('6', 413, 3, 6, 792764) The akiko ceremony took place on Sunday, when a grand feast was given.
('6', 413, 3, 7, 792835) Guests came from far and near and a lavish dinner was cooked for nearly 500 persons.
('6', 413, 3, 8, 792920) Mr. Abdul Kadir had specially come from Durban for the occasion; so had Mr. Haji Habib from Pretoria.
('6', 413, 3, 9, 793022) The occasion was celebrated with great eclat.
('6', 413, 3, 10, 793068) Some [of our readers] may not know what akiko is.
('6', 413, 3, 11, 793118) It is the ceremonial shaving of the head of the new born child on the seventh day.
('6', 413, 3, 12, 793201) According to their wealth and position, parents set aside gold, silver or copper equal in weight to the hair, and the value of the metal is spent on the feast.
('6', 413, 4, 13, 793361) ATTACK ON NEW CLARE WASHERMEN
('6', 413, 5, 14, 793391) A strong communication appears in The Sunday Times on the subject of washing places at New Clare.
('6', 413, 5, 15, 793489) The writer says that the wholeland at New Clare stinks with putrid air.
('6', 413, 5, 16, 793561) Indian washermen, according to him, have defiled the washing places; the water is dirty and stinks, so that clothes washed in it are as good as not washed at all.
('6', 413, 5, 17, 793724) The writer is afraid that some day an epidemic is bound to break out because of clothes washed in that water.
('6', 413, 5, 18, 793834) The Indian washermen have to be careful about this.
('6', 413, 5, 19, 793886) The washing place should be drained each time and filled again with clean water.
('6', 413, 5, 20, 793967) If this is not done, there is every fear of the washermen losing their livelihood, as the writer has suggested that the municipality should take effective measures.
('6', 413, 6, 21, 794132) COOLIE MERCHANTS Under the above heading, a contributor has written bitterly for the Sunday Times.
('6', 413, 6, 22, 794231) He alleges that it is only the Kaffirs and Indian hawkers who trade in gold pilfered from mines.
('6', 413, 6, 23, 794328) It is only thus that they get rich.
('6', 413, 6, 24, 794364) They melt the gold so stolen, make bracelets or armlets out of them and wear them on their persons.
('6', 413, 6, 25, 794464) The detectives know this, but they do not, and sometimes cannot, arrest the offenders.
('6', 413, 6, 26, 794551) The writer is certain of this, but good Indians and their English friends are not aware of this.
('6', 413, 6, 27, 794648) He has, however, no doubt that Indians are carrying on smuggling on a huge scale.
('6', 414, 0, 1, 794730) VOL. 6 : 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 415
('6', 414, 1, 2, 794774) No one knows how much of this is true.
('6', 414, 1, 3, 794813) But it is necessary that those Indians who are in this business of smuggling should take the hint.
('6', 414, 2, 4, 794912) INCITEMENT BY THE STAR
('6', 414, 3, 5, 794935) The Star has reproduced in full Mr. Ritchs letter published in The Morning Post with its own comments.
('6', 414, 3, 6, 795038) It says that the Indian community is vigilant and its friends in England are very powerful.
('6', 414, 3, 7, 795130) There are no dissensions among Indians and they work well.
('6', 414, 3, 8, 795189) They are very influential and they do not pause for breath even for a moment.
('6', 414, 3, 9, 795267) The Imperial Government is greatly afraid of them.
('6', 414, 3, 10, 795318) In the circumstances, says The Star, it will not be surprising if the new Bill is refused assent.
('6', 414, 3, 11, 795416) The whites are sitting back without being interested in the Ordinance.
('6', 414, 3, 12, 795487) The Star, therefore, suggests that the whites should hold big meetings and take steps to see that the Ordinance was passed.
('6', 414, 3, 13, 795611) Otherwise Indian infiltration would increase to the detriment of the whites.
('6', 414, 3, 14, 795688) Clearly the whites are afraid that the law may not be approved.
('6', 414, 3, 15, 795752) At this juncture it is necessary for us to exert all our strength.
('6', 414, 3, 16, 795819) If this is done, a victory [for us] even now would be nothing surprising.
('6', 414, 3, 17, 795893) But I am wrong.
('6', 414, 3, 18, 795909) Those who have accepted the gaol going resolution have already won.
('6', 414, 3, 19, 795977) For them there is victory either way.
('6', 414, 4, 20, 796015) DEPUTATION TO GENERAL BOTHA
('6', 414, 5, 21, 796043) A cable in The Rand Daily Mail indicates that a deputation on the subject of the Asiatic Registration Act, led by Lord Ampthill, has already met General Botha.
('6', 414, 5, 22, 796203) The deputation included Sir Muncherji, Sir Henry Cotton, Mr. Harold Cox, Mr. Justice Ameer Ali, Mr. Ritch and others.
('6', 414, 5, 23, 796321) Lord Ampthill said that no laws which humil iated the Indian community should be introduced.
('6', 414, 5, 24, 796414) Indians, who are already in the Transvaal, should be enabled to live there honourably.
('6', 414, 5, 25, 796501) In his reply General Botha said that there was no intention whatever of humiliating Indians, and that he would use his influence as practicable to preserve their honour.
('6', 414, 5, 26, 796671) The members of the deputation told the Press representatives that General Bothas reply was satisfactory.
('6', 414, 6, 27, 796776) HAJI OJER ALLY
('6', 414, 7, 28, 796791) Mr. Haji Ojer Ally writes from Cape Town to say that the Cape Immigration Officer will not henceforth insist on a photograph being affixed to the pass.
('6', 414, 7, 29, 796943) Mr. Ally saw Mr. Powell, the editor of The Argus,

('6', 415, 1, 2, 797035) who has promised to help.
('6', 415, 1, 3, 797061) Mr. Ally is trying to obtain 50 from the Cape Association for the London Committee.
('6', 415, 2, 4, 797145) INDIANS GOING TO LOBITO BAY1
('6', 415, 3, 5, 797174) The local agent of the employer informs me that all the Natal Indians have reached Lobito Bay safely.
('6', 415, 3, 6, 797276) The climate in that part of Lobito Bay is very good.

('6', 415, 8, 11, 797423) TO THE EDITOR INDIAN OPINION
('6', 415, 9, 12, 797452) SIR, Many of our brethren have written to me to say that they will go to gaol in pursuance of the September Resolution, if the Registration Act of the Transvaal is passed.
('6', 415, 9, 13, 797624) Every one of them deserves to be congratulated.
('6', 415, 9, 14, 797672) From some of the letters, I find that a few are annoyed at the absence of such letters from leaders.
('6', 415, 9, 15, 797773) Their not having written is, I am sure, no reason for doubting them.
('6', 415, 9, 16, 797842) I do not think that they will come forward to take out the compulsory registers.
('6', 415, 9, 17, 797923) However, lest I should be guilty of this sin of omission, I hereby declare my Pledge that, should the new law come into force, I will never take out a permit or register under the law but will go to goal; and even if I am the only one left who has not taken a permit, my pledge shall stand for the following reasons: 1. I consider it a humiliation to submit to this law, and I prefer to go to gaol rather than submit to such humiliation; 2. I believe that my country is dearer to me than my person; 3. if, after having announced the September Resolution to the world, the Indian community submits to the law, it will lose everything; 4. I believe that prominent men who have been helping our cause in England rely upon the Fourth Resolution; if we shrink back, we shall

I believe that Indians will rise in public esteem if all of them remain staunch in not submitting to the law, and that, moreover, it will evoke sympathy in India also for the cause of the Transvaal Indians.
('6', 416, 2, 3, 799306) Many other reasons can be adduced.
('6', 416, 2, 4, 799341) In the end I appeal to every Transvaal Indian not to miss this occasion and not to turn back.
('6', 416, 2, 5, 799435) I beg the Indians of Natal, the Cape and Delagoa Bay to encourage us, the Transvaal people, and render help when the need arises.

('6', 416, 7, 10, 799658) BOX 6522, JOHANNESBURG April 30, 1907
('6', 416, 8, 11, 799696) TO THE EDITOR THE STAR [JOHANNESBURG]
('6', 416, 10, 12, 799734) You have raised the bogey of the Indian Peril and based it on Mr. Ritchs able letter to The Morning Post.
('6', 416, 10, 13, 799840) Fortunately for the country, you have evidently mis read Mr. Ritchs letter and ascribed to him a demand not made by him for political rights on behalf of British Indians.
('6', 416, 10, 14, 800011) If you will be good enough to re read the letter, you will find that instead of claiming any such rights, Mr. Ritch has
('6', 416, 11, 15, 800131) 1 This was in reply to an article in The Star, 29 4 1907.
('6', 417, 0, 1, 800189) 418 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 417, 1, 2, 800231) repudiated the claim more than once.
('6', 417, 1, 3, 800268) He says:
('6', 417, 2, 4, 800277) In deference to the demand of the white colonist for protection against an unrestricted influx of Asiatics, the qualifications imposed by an Immigra tion Restriction Law, upon an educational basis, are assented to.
('6', 417, 2, 5, 800492) He (the Indian) seeks no political power, and admits the right of municipalities to control the issuing of trading licences, with power of appeal to the judicial tribunals of the Colony against inequitable administration.
('6', 417, 2, 6, 800714) If words have any meaning, you have, in the above sentences in the letter you have printed, a complete denial of the charge made against the community.
('6', 417, 2, 7, 800866) The ground, therefore, being cleared as to the allegation of the British Indian wanting to have political power in South Africa, with your permission, I would venture to, draw your attention to the fact that you are creating animosity between two communities living under the same flag without the slightest occasion, and, in support of my statement, I ask you to read the compromise offered by the British Indian Association, whereby everything that will be done by the Registration Act can be done immediately and without Imperial sanction being necessary.
('6', 417, 2, 8, 801425) Greater identification is the cry raised.
('6', 417, 2, 9, 801467) British Indians have themselves offered to exchange their lawful documents for those bearing sufficient identification particulars as may be mutually agreed upon.
('6', 417, 2, 10, 801630) Not that the present documents do not contain enough details to identify the holders.
('6', 417, 2, 11, 801716) The compromise has been offered to soothe the agitated mind of the colonist.
('6', 417, 2, 12, 801793) Moreover, the compromise, strange as it may appear, goes further than the Asiatic Act itself, in that the former includes the taking out of permits by minors who have reached the age of discretion, the same to be decided by the Colonial Secretary.
('6', 417, 2, 13, 802041) You may ask why, if the offer is sincere, should there be any fuss about the Act.
('6', 417, 2, 14, 802123) The answer is obvious.
('6', 417, 2, 15, 802146) British Indians do not wish to be classed as criminals, as they undoubtedly are by the Act.
('6', 417, 2, 16, 802238) They repudiate totally the suggestion that there is any illegal influx on a wholesale scale, or that there is any countenance of such influx on the part of the leaders of the community.
('6', 417, 2, 17, 802424) Repressive legislation is requ ired when those to whom it applies are not compliant and do not do voluntarily what is asked of them.
('6', 417, 2, 18, 802557) British Indians have always claimed to be law abiding, and,therefore, object to the class legislation which is a denial of the claim.
('6', 417, 2, 19, 802691) You may call this sentiment, if you will.
('6', 417, 2, 20, 802733) Still, it is one which is very real for the community I have the honour to represent, and it is hardly necessary for me to give you illustrations of sentiment having ruled mens actions from the time of Adam.

('6', 418, 1, 2, 802984) The suggested compromise can cost little.
('6', 418, 1, 3, 803026) If there is any doubt as to its effectiveness, why not give it a trial while the Act isconsidered?
('6', 418, 1, 4, 803125) Will it not be better and more Imperialistic for you to advocate the adoption of the compromise than unnecessarily to inflame the populace against harmless subjects of the Crown?

('6', 418, 8, 10, 803416) In connection with the action proposed to be taken by the Rand Pioneers and the Transvaal Municipal Association regarding the Asiatic Registration Act, I venture, on behalf of my Association, to draw your Committees attention to the compromise offered by the British Indians, and to the fact that it completely meets every requirement of the Registration Act and hastens the fulfilment of the object your Committee has in view.
('6', 418, 8, 11, 803844) My Association has always held the opinion that, as a matter of fact, there is very little difference between what is required by the white colonists and what has been accepted by British Indians.
('6', 418, 8, 12, 804041) The latter ask for no political rights and, as against the repeal of Law 3 of 1885, they consent to municipal control, subject to review by the Supreme Court, over trading licences, and to restriction on immig ration along the Natal or the Cape basis.
('6', 418, 8, 13, 804293) My Association is firmly of opinion that much of the agita tion is due entirely to a misunderstanding of the mutual position.
('6', 418, 9, 14, 804419) 1 This letter, presumably drafted by Gandhiji, was addressed to the Rand Pioneers and the Transvaal Municipal Association, who had announced their intention of agitating in order to bring about the early enforcement of the Asiatic Registration Act.

('6', 419, 1, 3, 805082) My Association has no doubt that your Committee is not actuated by any vindictive motives in its agitation my Association for consultation will be accepted in the spirit in against Coloured people.

('6', 419, 9, 12, 805617) May I once more take the liberty of correcting you?
('6', 419, 9, 13, 805669) I fear you have not yet understood the compromise.
('6', 419, 9, 14, 805720) The cry is not Trust the Indians, as you have put it.
('6', 419, 9, 15, 805774) The cry is trust the Indians in the interim, and see whether the trust is not justified.
('6', 419, 9, 16, 805863) Under the Registration Act, all Indians have to be compulsorily registered.
('6', 419, 9, 17, 805939) Under the Indian offer they can be voluntarily registered, and that now.

('6', 420, 1, 4, 806786) The law will then reach the culprits and leave the innocent free.
('6', 420, 1, 5, 806852) The Act at present punishes the vast majority of the innocent, self respecting people, for the sake of the guilty few.
('6', 420, 1, 6, 806971) You dismiss the objections of the Indian community by describing them as super sensitive.
('6', 420, 1, 7, 807061) You dismiss Lord Ampthill and his friends equally unceremoniously by ascribing to them what you, I suppose, would call the Oriental taint, and depriving them of the possession of a spirit of wider Imperialism.
('6', 420, 1, 8, 807271) I can only remind you that Lord Milner, whom you will not classify with Lord Ampthill, in his article in The National Review, in reminding the colonists of wider Imperialism, places before them their responsibilities to British dependencies, and especially British India.

('6', 420, 5, 12, 807631) We publish elsewhere a summary of the address presented to Mr. Smuts, Acting Prime Minister of the Transvaal, by the Klerksdorp Indians, and of his reply.
('6', 420, 5, 13, 807786) It is clear from the reply that Mr. Smuts himself fears that his law, even if assented to, will be rendered ineffective if the Indian community sticks to the resolution on gaol going.
('6', 420, 5, 14, 807970) He therefore tries to persuade everyone that the Associations agitation against the Act is pointless.
('6', 420, 5, 15, 808072) This much even Mr. Smuts seems to admit, that the law punishes, as it were, the whole Indian community just because there have been a few fresh cases of infiltration into the Transvaal.
('6', 420, 5, 16, 808258) He adds that it may happen for a time that the police will question people in every nook and corner.
('6', 420, 5, 17, 808359) Only Mr. Smuts can tell what is meant by for a time.
('6', 420, 5, 18, 808412) There is absolutely no doubt that the Indian community should under no circumstances submit to such a law Mr. Smutss speech should be treated as a provocation to Indians.
('6', 420, 5, 19, 808583) He seems to hold that the Indian community can be ill treated with impunity.
('6', 420, 5, 20, 808660) It looks as if it will now get a chance to open his eyes [to the truth].

('6', 421, 2, 3, 808834) The Immigration Act of the Cape is so complicated that its implications cannot be realized just yet, but by and by the adverse effects will follow.
('6', 421, 2, 4, 808982) One clause is especially mischievous: if any Indian leaves the Cape without a permit, his right to return will lapse.
('6', 421, 2, 5, 809100) This means that, if 3 leading Indian businessman of the Cape leaves without the annual permit, he will not be able to return.
('6', 421, 2, 6, 809226) Even if his business in the Cape continues and his family stays on there, that will not help him.
('6', 421, 2, 7, 809324) We do not mean to suggest that the law will in fact hit the businessman so hard, but such are the implications of the Act.
('6', 421, 2, 8, 809447) The result will be that all poor Indians will have to leave the Cape.
('6', 421, 2, 9, 809517) And if a few Indians stay behind, what influence can they have?
('6', 421, 2, 10, 809581) The Indian businessmen in the Cape should heed this warning and see to it that no Indian leaves the Cape without a permit.
('6', 421, 2, 11, 809704) We hope that those Cape Indians who happen to read this will bring it to the notice of the others and explain it to them.

('6', 421, 7, 17, 810027) The people in the Punjab appear to be preparing for a revolt.
('6', 421, 7, 18, 810089) This is the first upheaval of the kind seen in India after 1857. The Native Press has been inciting the people both openly and secretly.
('6', 421, 7, 19, 810226) It was not right that [the editor of] the Punjabi should have been prosecuted.

('6', 422, 5, 11, 811228) [May 7, 1907]
('6', 422, 6, 12, 811242) Mr. M. K. Gandhi was yesterday interviewed by a Mercury representative concerning the suggestion put forward by Mr. Lionel Curtis in The Timesa reference to which was contained in our telegraphic news columns on Mondaythat the tropical possessions of Great Britain should be reserved for Indian colonization.
('6', 422, 6, 13, 811551) Mr. Gandhi rejects the proposal.
('6', 422, 6, 14, 811584) As long as Indians have domicile rights in the Colonies, whether in South Africa or elsewhere, Mr. Gandhi objects, such a suggestion is not practicable, and would certainly not be acceptable to the British Indians.
('6', 422, 6, 15, 811799) As he has so often asserted, the entire motive which is animating the cause he has taken up on behalf of the South African Asiatic is to protect what he designates the Indians vested rights in this country; and to deprive them of the title of domicile, which many of them now possess, would, of course, in his view, be to subvert those vested rights.
('6', 422, 6, 16, 812150) Mr. Gandhi said that the rights of domicile were the main strength of the Indians position, and he assented to the suggestion that they intended to make the most of it.
('6', 422, 6, 17, 812319) It was pointed out to Mr. Gandhi that the proposal seemed to be that the tropical Colonies should be reserved for immigration of the future, not necessarily contemplating the removal of Indians already possessing domicile rights, and he was asked what his view of that idea would be.
('6', 422, 7, 18, 812603) Mr, Gandhi denied that there was any pressure of population in India leading to the necessity of emigration, and pointed to the fact that the Indians who were brought over as indentured labourers did not offer themselves, but had to be persuaded to come that, moreover, recruiting was becoming increasingly difficult.
('6', 422, 7, 19, 812921) The same applied to the recruiting for other places in which Indian labour was wanted, and he advanced this to show that India had no real surplus population, and needed no outlet.
('6', 422, 7, 20, 813102) The idea of reserving any territory outside India at all for exclusive colonization by Indians
('6', 423, 0, 1, 813197) 424 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 423, 1, 2, 813239) was therefore a gratuitous and unnecessary one.
('6', 423, 1, 3, 813287) He did not believe that the resources of India had become too exhausted to support its people or the natural increase of its population.
('6', 423, 1, 4, 813424) There was room for what he called internal emigration within India itself, but no need of any territorial provision outside.
('6', 423, 2, 5, 813549) He had often been asked, Mr. Gandhi proceeded, why, if this were so, Indians were found emigrating in such numbers to South Africa.
('6', 423, 2, 6, 813681) The explanation was that South Africa had itself made the mischief by adopting the practice of indentured immigrationa system which, Mr. Gandhi said, nearly every Indian in South Africa would sign a petition against, and ask that it should cease.
('6', 423, 3, 7, 813928) [REPORTER:] But the trouble arises, Mr. Gandhi, not so much from the indentured Indian as from the free merchant class, and from whom the demand for equal trading rights mostly comes.
('6', 423, 3, 8, 814112) [GANDHIJI:] The Indian merchant follows the other Indians, to whom he looks for his business.
('6', 423, 3, 9, 814206) If the indentured man was not here, the merchant would not be here.
('6', 423, 3, 10, 814274) As it is, many of the better class Indian merchants, who have large interests, remain in their own country, where they have scope for their business, and where every Indian tradesman would have scope if he preferred to stay instead of coming to the Colonies.
('6', 423, 3, 11, 814533) As long as there remain opportunities for business among his own countrymen, there the Indian merchant will be found.
('6', 423, 4, 12, 814651) .Mr. Gandhi instanced the case of Zanzibar.
('6', 423, 4, 13, 814695) There was, in fact, no need to reserve tropical Colonies for Indian occupation, for East Africa was already open.
('6', 423, 5, 14, 814809) Mr. Gandhi went on to refer to the Registration Ordinance in the Transvaal, and referred in disappointed terms to the decision of the Imperial Government to allow its sanction to the measure.
('6', 423, 5, 15, 815001) Its effect was, he said, to place the Transvaal Indian in the position of a ticket of leave man.
('6', 423, 5, 16, 815098) If they were to be dealt with along these lines it was better that the Indians should be undeceived at once.
('6', 423, 5, 17, 815207) Mr. Gandhi said he foresaw the possibility of a position in which Great Britain would have to decide between losing the Colonies or leasing India, for the peoples self respect was involved, and their existence under such conditions as in the Transvaal would become intolerable.
('6', 423, 5, 18, 815485) The Indian was perfectly capable of realizing both sides of the question.
('6', 423, 5, 19, 815559) and, he thought, did so, but the Asiatic problem was not to be solved by measures such as the Transvaal Ordinance.
('6', 423, 5, 20, 815674) Asked whether he regarded the passing of the Ordinance as a weakening of the Indians position in South Africa, Mr. Gandhi asserted that it undoubtedly was so, but he believed that the disappointment of their hopes would in the end result advantageously, if the Indians would abide by their resolve to resist.
('6', 423, 5, 21, 815983) There would be said Mr. Gandhi, no resistance by force, but passive
('6', 424, 0, 1, 816051) VOL. 6: 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 425
('6', 424, 1, 2, 816094) resistance; and if the Indian people carried out their determination to undergo imprisonment rather than conform to the Ordinance, he thought well enough of the Colonial white to believe that such a demonstration of courage for the sake of a principle would be met with administration and, in the end, sympathy.

('6', 424, 7, 15, 817227) [Before May 11, 1907] 3
('6', 424, 8, 16, 817251) CHHAGANLAL,
('6', 424, 9, 17, 817263) I have your letter.
('6', 424, 9, 18, 817283) I said nothing about the figures in the balance sheet you sent me because, as you wrote, the final figures you
('6', 424, 10, 19, 817394) 1 Only pages five and six of the letter are available.
('6', 424, 10, 20, 817449) From the contents, however, it is clear that it was addressed to Chhaganlal Gandhi at Phoenix.
('6', 424, 10, 21, 817544) 2 Kalyandas was in Durban on April 23, 1907, doing Phoenix work; (Vide Letter to Kalyandas Mehta, (23 4 1907).
('6', 424, 10, 22, 817655) This letter was clearly written on or after that date.
('6', 424, 10, 23, 817710) He left South Africa by the same boat as Omar Haji Amod Zaveri (Vide Kalyandas Jagmohandas [Mehta], 11 5 1907); this must have been between May 6, when many farewell parties were given in honour of Zaveri, and May 11, when the note on Kalyandas was published Indian Opinion.
('6', 424, 11, 24, 817985) 3 The letter was evidently written before Kalyandas left South Africa, i.e., before May 11, 1907; vide Kalyandas Jagmohandas [Mehta], 11 5 1907.
('6', 425, 0, 1, 818130) 426 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 425, 1, 2, 818172) were yet to send.
('6', 425, 1, 3, 818190) Your provisional figures reveal a profit of  20!
('6', 425, 1, 4, 818239) If that is really the position, it seems your going to England will certainly have to be postponed.
('6', 425, 1, 5, 818339) And now that Kalyandas is leaving, your going is out of the question.
('6', 425, 1, 6, 818409) We must hope now for something to happen in March next year.
('6', 425, 1, 7, 818470) Meanwhile, let us see how things develop.
('6', 425, 1, 8, 818512) You are not afraid of the cold and so we may hope for something in November.
('6', 425, 1, 9, 818589) Events are moving fast here.
('6', 425, 1, 10, 818618) It looks as if I would have to go to jail.

('6', 425, 5, 22, 819191) 368. WILL INDIANS BE SLAVES?
('6', 425, 6, 23, 819220) The Transvaal Act has received [Royal] assent earlier than we expected.
('6', 425, 6, 24, 819292) The Imperial Government has chosen to take the first step of binding the Indian community with chains.
('6', 425, 6, 25, 819395) It now remains to be seen whether the community will carry this yoke.
('6', 425, 6, 26, 819465) We know of a young student from Japan who once went to a lawyer in Johannesburg for some personal work.
('6', 425, 6, 27, 819569) As the lawyer could not see him immediately, the student waited outside.
('6', 425, 6, 28, 819642) Meanwhile, an English official came to meet the lawyer.
('6', 425, 6, 29, 819698) As he was about to enter the lawyers office after knocking, the young Japanese held him by the sleeve and said to him spiritedly: You cannot go in just yet.
('6', 425, 6, 30, 819855) I have a prior right. Being a gentleman, the officer at once saw the point, and requested the young mans permission to go in first, as he had urgent work.
('6', 425, 6, 31, 820010) The student was as polite as he had been bold.
('6', 425, 6, 32, 820057) For, when the official asked his leave, he readily allowed him to go in.
('6', 425, 6, 33, 820130) This anecdote
('6', 426, 0, 1, 820144) VOL. 6: 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 427
('6', 426, 1, 2, 820187) should be engraved on the mind of every Indian, for it gives an exact idea of our bond of slavery.
('6', 426, 1, 3, 820286) The young Japanese did not allow his self respect to be flouted.
('6', 426, 1, 4, 820351) When every one in Japan, the rich as well as the poor, came to believe in self respect, the country became free.
('6', 426, 1, 5, 820464) She could give Russia a slap in the face, and today Japans flag flies very high in the world.
('6', 426, 1, 6, 820558) Though her people wear a yellow skin, Japan enjoys friendship with white England as between equals.
('6', 426, 1, 7, 820658) In the same way we too need to feel the spirit of self respect.
('6', 426, 1, 8, 820722) Having remained in bondage for a long time like a caged parrot, we cannot realize what honour and freedom are Furthermore, like the parrot which is pleased when bound with a golden string and made to perform, we too are elated and blush pink at the thought of our imagined happiness, when our masters, whether white or Coloured, feign affection for us only in order to bind us with the golden thread and make us forget our real condition.
('6', 426, 1, 9, 821161) To remind us of that condition, this irksome law has been sanctioned.
('6', 426, 1, 10, 821231) Shall we now obey it and become slaves?
('6', 426, 1, 11, 821271) Our Johannes burg correspondent says that the regulations under the new law will be lenient and considerate.
('6', 426, 1, 12, 821380) That is to say, Lord Elgin may bind us with a golden thread.
('6', 426, 1, 13, 821441) Shall we allow ourselves to be deluded thus?
('6', 426, 1, 14, 821486) We, for our part, can only reply in the negative to both these questions.
('6', 426, 1, 15, 821560) A great deal of effort is required to get this law repealed, and in no case must we turn back.
('6', 426, 1, 16, 821655) Let us give this matter a little thought.
('6', 426, 1, 17, 821697) A huge meeting was held in September, and we proclaimed that the Indian community would go to gaol rather than submit to the proposed Act.
('6', 426, 1, 18, 821836) 1 While doing so, every Indian took an oath in the name of Ishwar or Khuda.
('6', 426, 1, 19, 821912) Though that law was disallowed, the one now passed is exactly of the same nature.
('6', 426, 1, 20, 821994) All the arguments that could be advanced against such an act then can be put forward now, and in fact many more.
('6', 426, 1, 21, 822107) For we have worked hard against it and shouted our protests from house tops.
('6', 426, 1, 22, 822184) Moreover, we thought the Bill so objectionable that we raised big subscriptions with which to send the Deputation to England; it cost us 700. In the presence of high officials, the Deputation told Lord Elgin:
('6', 426, 2, 23, 822393) We should also place before Your Lordship one more fact and that is the Fourth Resolution passed by the mass meeting.
('6', 426, 2, 24, 822511) That Resolution, which was unanimously approved by the
('6', 426, 3, 25, 822566) 1 Fourth Resolution; vide The Mass Meeting, 11 9 1906.
('6', 427, 0, 1, 822621) 428 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 427, 1, 2, 822663) meeting in all humility and firmness and affirmed with an oath, said that, if ever the Imperial Government should approve the Act, the Indian community would go to gaol rather than suffer the great indignity inflicted on it by the Act.
('6', 427, 1, 3, 822899) So deep was the feeling of the community.
('6', 427, 1, 4, 822941) We have submitted to much suffering till now.
('6', 427, 1, 5, 822987) But the disgrace of this act is unbearable, and that is why we have travelled six thousand miles to make an appeal to you.
('6', 427, 1, 6, 823110) With this Act we have reached the utmost limit.
('6', 427, 2, 7, 823158) As though this were not enough, and as if there was the slightest doubt in anyones mind about the gaol going resolution, the South Africa British Indian Committee was formed, and many prominent men joined it.
('6', 427, 2, 8, 823367) Now if, under any pretext, the Indian community should cancel the gaol going resolution, what would be the result?
('6', 427, 2, 9, 823482) Only that the South Africa British Indian Committee would have become futile.
('6', 427, 2, 10, 823560) The Deputations labours would have been in vain.
('6', 427, 2, 11, 823609) .All the fame that the Indian community has now gained would turn into disgrace.
('6', 427, 2, 12, 823690) The Government would henceforth put no trust in the Indian communitys word.
('6', 427, 2, 13, 823766) We would be classed with the lowest and meanest.
('6', 427, 2, 14, 823815) If this should happen, the Imperial Government would give ready assent to all the laws directed against the Indians in South Africa.
('6', 427, 2, 15, 823948) And in the end those who are not content to live a dogs life or that of a crow will have to leave South Africa.
('6', 427, 2, 16, 824060) Moreover, if things should come to such a pass, there would be repercussions in India too, and the whole country might look down upon us with well deserved contempt.
('6', 427, 2, 17, 824226) Such are the force and the usefulness of the Fourth Resolution, and so serious its implications.
('6', 427, 2, 18, 824323) It is therefore our earnest hope that the Indian community will not swerve from it.
('6', 427, 2, 19, 824407) Whether or not all of us are agreed, those who realize how things stand must not fail in their duty.

('6', 428, 5, 9, 825187) As a result of the Durban Corporations decision to reduce the rice ration, the indentured Indians employed by them have struck work, and have got ready to go to gaol.
('6', 428, 5, 10, 825354) They did this earlier also.
('6', 428, 5, 11, 825382) On that occasion, the Magistrate was kind.
('6', 428, 5, 12, 825425) He observed that, even though it was legal to give them maize instead of rice, it would be cruel to insist on the [letter of the] law.
('6', 428, 5, 13, 825560) He therefore let the men off and advised the Corporation to give them rice as usual, even if it was dearer.
('6', 428, 5, 14, 825668) The same situation has arisen today, but the Magistrate is Mr. Beans.
('6', 428, 5, 15, 825738) He has given judgement strictly according to the law and sentenced many workers to a fine of 1 each.
('6', 428, 5, 16, 825839) We hope Indian lawyers will look into the matter and do something about it.
('6', 428, 5, 17, 825915) If we think of the Transvaal Ordinance in this context, we can see that, when laws are found to be harsher, even poor indentured workers can muster enough courage to rise against them and get ready to go to gaol.
('6', 428, 5, 18, 826128) We have seen from the case of the indentured men that such remedies often secure justice.
('6', 428, 5, 19, 826218) If indentured labourers can do so much in self interest, who will deny that the Indian community in the Transvaal ought to do no less?

('6', 429, 1, 2, 826762) Zaveri was born at Porbunder in 1872. He set out for Africa at the early age of twelve with his brother, the late renowned Mr. Aboobaker Zaveri 1. While on the ship he began his education, and learnt Gujarati.
('6', 429, 1, 3, 826972) For four years he studied privately and at the Government School in Durban.
('6', 429, 1, 4, 827048) His studies were cut short by the death of Aboobaker in 1887. In 1890 he joined the firm of his guardian, Mr. Abdulla Haji Adam, as an apprentice.
('6', 429, 1, 5, 827195) Then he satisfied, to some extent, his keen desire to learn Arabic and Persian.
('6', 429, 1, 6, 827275) In 1897 he took part in public activities for the first time and was made Joint Honorary Secretary of the Durban Anjuman [ e ] Islam.
('6', 429, 1, 7, 827409) Omar was interested in horticulture, and as fruit was scarce in Porbunder, he experimented with fruit growing as a result of which some fruits are now to be had there in plenty.
('6', 429, 1, 8, 827587) For six months during 1904, he toured Egypt, Italy, Switzerland, France, England and America and obtained valuable experience.
('6', 429, 1, 9, 827714) 2 At this time, he had with him a barrister as a tutor companion.
('6', 429, 1, 10, 827780) It was meant to be an educational tour.
('6', 429, 2, 11, 827820) While in London, he met Mr. Dadabhai Naoroji, Sir Muncherji Bhownaggree and others, and returned to Durban the same year.
('6', 429, 2, 12, 827942) He was then made Joint Honorary Secretary of the Natal Indian Congress, along with Mr. Adamji Miankhan.
('6', 429, 2, 13, 828046) The work he has done since then is well known to the Indian community.
('6', 429, 2, 14, 828117) His wealth, his servants, his house, his time and his educationall these have been entirely at the disposal of the community.
('6', 429, 2, 15, 828243) During the Transvaal Deputations visit to England and again during the agitation against the Dealers Licenses Act, Mr. Omar Zaveri worked very hard along with Mr. Anglia.
('6', 429, 2, 16, 828414) Mr. Zaveri also took a leading part in founding the Memon Committee.
('6', 429, 2, 17, 828483) The Durban Library has received many gifts of books from him and he himself visited it almost daily.
('6', 429, 2, 18, 828584) Impelled by a kind nature, he has always attempted to bring about private settle ment of disputes among members of the Indian community.
('6', 429, 2, 19, 828721) People hold such a high opinion of his integrity that he has had with him a general power of attorney from a number of people.
('6', 429, 2, 20, 828848) In the course of all this work, Mr. Omar realized the need for further education and intends to become a barrister after passing the Matriculation examina tion.
('6', 429, 2, 21, 829009) As an instance of his humility and simplicity, it may be mentioned that he himself teaches his servants and children at home whenever he has the leisure.

('6', 430, 1, 2, 829264) Mr. Omar Haji Amod Zaveri possesses all the qualities denoted by his name 1. He is still young in years.
('6', 430, 1, 3, 829369) If hispresent ideas keep growing, he is sure to prove himself invaluable in India also.

('6', 430, 5, 7, 829534) Another gentleman who, by virtue of his qualities is a zaveri although his name is Kalyandashas sailed home by the same boat as Mr. Omar Haji Amod Zaveri.
('6', 430, 5, 8, 829689) Mr. Zaveris function was to lead, that of Mr. Kalyandas to work silently for a good cause remaining in the background.
('6', 430, 5, 9, 829808) In years he is still a child, but in our experience we have seldom come across a youth so tender of heart, so scornful of money, so regardless of his own body but at the same time so solicitous of the welfare of others.
('6', 430, 5, 10, 830028) Johannesburg Indians are aware of the work done by Kalyandas during the terrible outbreak of plague in that city.
('6', 430, 5, 11, 830142) We do not know of anyone having had occasion to be displeased with him at any time.
('6', 430, 5, 12, 830226) Indias chains would snap this day, if in that country captains like Mr. Omar Haji Amod Zaveri and soldiers like Kalyandas came forward in large numbers.
('6', 430, 5, 13, 830379) Rarely does one come across heroes who would ceaselessly, and always with a cheerful smile, quietly give themselves over to public service in pursuance of duty, that is, in the name of Khuda, seeking neither money nor honours, and never even creaming of leadership.
('6', 430, 5, 14, 830645) Kalyandases are rare indeed.

('6', 430, 9, 18, 830757) Many gentlemen gave parties in honour of the well known and popular Mr. Omar Haji Amod Zaveri, the Joint Honorary Secretary of
('6', 430, 10, 19, 830884) 1 Zaveri means jeweller.
('6', 430, 10, 20, 830909) 2 This was published as a Special Report for Indian Opinion, presumably by Gandhiji, who was present at some of the farewell parties.
('6', 431, 0, 1, 831043) 432 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 431, 1, 2, 831085) the Natal Indian Congress, on the eve of his departure for India [last week].
('6', 431, 1, 3, 831163) Finally a meeting of the Natal Indian Congress was held on the evening of the 6th at Dawad Mahomeds Hall in Pyne Street.
('6', 431, 1, 4, 831284) Those who gave parties to Mr. Zaveri include Mr. Dada Osman, Mr. Ahmed Osman, Mr. Tayob Moosa, Mr. Peeran Mahomed, members of the staff of Indian Opinion, Mr. Dada Abdulla, Mr. G. H. Miankhan, Mr. M. C. Anglia, Mr. Mahomed Cassim Camroodeen and Mr. Parsee Rustomjee.
('6', 431, 1, 5, 831551) At each of these parties the number of invitees ranged from 40 to 100, and to some of them gentlemen from all the Indian communities Hindu, Muslim, Parsi, Christianwere invited.
('6', 431, 1, 6, 831729) At all these functions the qualities of Mr. Omar Haji Amod Zaveri were extolled in various ways.
('6', 431, 1, 7, 831826) The hope was expressed that, during his absence [from the Transvaal], Mr. Zaveri might be able to go on the Haj pilgrimage and also realize his desire of becoming a barrister.
('6', 431, 1, 8, 832002) At one of the functions Mr. Ismail Gora expressed the hope that Mr. Zaveri would take advantage of his visit to Porbunder to resolve the dispute going on there about the Madressa.
('6', 431, 1, 9, 832182) At the party given by Mr. Peeran Mahomed Mr. Gandhi was present, having come from the Transvaal for the occasion.
('6', 431, 1, 10, 832296) As the news about the passing of the [Asiatic Registration] Act was received that day, the matter was also discussed at the party.
('6', 431, 1, 11, 832427) Many speakers pointed out that Mr. Zaveri would be truly honoured if the spirit of patriotism he possessed could be inculcated in Indians, and if all of them supported the Transvaal Indians and exhorted them to adhere to the gaol going resolution.
('6', 431, 1, 12, 832675) Mr. Rustomjee had returned from Bombay on the same day on which a party was given at his place.
('6', 431, 1, 13, 832771) He was much satisfied with the work of Mr. Zaveri who held his general power of attorney during his absence.
('6', 431, 1, 14, 832880) He said that he felt happy and proud to be present on the occasion.
('6', 431, 1, 15, 832948) A gold watch, a gold chain and a pencil case were then presented to Mr. Zaveri.
('6', 431, 2, 16, 833028) The party by the members of the staff of Indian Opinion was given at Phoenix.
('6', 431, 2, 17, 833106) Twelve gentlemen from Durban, who out of regard for Mr. Zaveri did not mind the inconvenience of a journey to Phoenix, had accepted the invitation.
('6', 431, 2, 18, 833254) The following address was presented to Mr. Zaveri by members of the staff: We, the undersigned, representing the staff of Indian Opinion, beg to express our thanks to you for the interest you have always taken in our Settlement, and in the political work which this journal is

('6', 432, 1, 2, 833574) trying to do for the benefit of British Indians in South Africa.
('6', 432, 1, 3, 833639) We trust that you will have a pleasant and safe voyage to India and that, while there, you will not slacken your efforts in trying to alleviate the sufferings and disabilities of your countrymen in the South African Colonies.
('6', 432, 1, 4, 833865) We appreciate the interest you have taken in our work at Phoenix during your frequent visits, and we sincerely hope that you will soon return and be amongst us again.
('6', 432, 2, 5, 834032) MEETING OF CONGRESS
('6', 432, 3, 6, 834052) The hall was tightly packed for the Congress meeting on Monday.
('6', 432, 3, 7, 834116) It was well decorated, the credit for which goes to Mr. Paul.
('6', 432, 3, 8, 834178) At this meeting Mr. Dada Osman was elected Joint Secretary in place of Mr. Zaveri.
('6', 432, 3, 9, 834261) Before the address was read out, the President, Mr. Dawad Mahomed, made the following speech:
('6', 432, 4, 10, 834355) The primary reason for Mr. Omar Haji Amod Zaveris popularity is that he is not partial to any community.
('6', 432, 4, 11, 834460) He regards Hindu, Muslim, Parsi as well as Christian as his brothers.
('6', 432, 4, 12, 834530) He looks upon his wealth [as something] to be used for the benefit of the community.
('6', 432, 4, 13, 834615) Wealth that is not put to good use is useless.
('6', 432, 4, 14, 834662) Mr. Zaveri, having come to feel that the glory of learning is greater than that of riches, has decided to pursue his studies further.
('6', 432, 4, 15, 834796) If anyone thinks that education is impossible at this age, I would point out that Shaikh Saadi started his studies after the age of forty.
('6', 432, 4, 16, 834935) Mr. Zaveri has freely used his men for Congress work.
('6', 432, 4, 17, 834989) [For instance] Mr. Chhabildas rendered very good help [for that body].
('6', 432, 5, 18, 835060) ASIATIC ORDINANCE
('6', 432, 6, 19, 835078) Speaking on the passing of the Asiatic Act Mr. Dawad Mahomed said:
('6', 432, 7, 20, 835145) I am very sorry indeed about the Act that has been passed in the Transvaal.
('6', 432, 7, 21, 835221) I shuddered when I read the telegram announ cing the passing of the Act.
('6', 432, 7, 22, 835294) It is very humiliating to us.
('6', 432, 7, 23, 835324) Every Indian has a stake in opposing it.
('6', 432, 7, 24, 835365) I have felt very strongly indeed that we should not submit to the law even if we have to lose our entire fortune [by opposing it].
('6', 432, 7, 25, 835496) I therefore hope that the Indian community in the Transvaal will firmly oppose the
('6', 433, 0, 1, 835579) 434 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 433, 1, 2, 835621) measure and be prepared to go to gaol, if that becomes necessary.
('6', 433, 1, 3, 835687) Gaol, if one is sent to it for a cause like this, would be a garden.
('6', 433, 1, 4, 835756) It adds to ones fame; there is nothing humilia ting about it.
('6', 433, 1, 5, 835818) I also hope that no one will have any dealings with the Permit Office in Durban.
('6', 433, 1, 6, 835899) If we do not muster adequate strength for opposing this law, the time for our departure will eventually come and bad laws will begin to be enacted in all parts of South Africa.
('6', 433, 1, 7, 836076) CONGRESS ADDRESS We, the undersigned, on behalf of the Natal Indian Congress, wish to record our appreciation of the great and noble work you have performed for the Indian community during your term of office as [Joint Honorary] Secretary of the Natal Indian Congress, for Which office your recent travels in Europe and America excellently fitted you.
('6', 433, 1, 8, 836428) By your unremitting zeal, great patience, and patriotism, you have kept your Indian work ever in the forefront and have rendered invaluable assistance to the public cause.
('6', 433, 1, 9, 836600) Your sweet, sympathetic disposition, and your unswerving rectitude have endeared you to all, and it will be difficult to fill the gap [created] by your absence.
('6', 433, 1, 10, 836761) You have lived up to the traditions handed down by your late lamented brother, Aboobaker.
('6', 433, 1, 11, 836851) Your hospitality has become proverbial.
('6', 433, 1, 12, 836891) Your house has been open to rich and poor alike.
('6', 433, 1, 13, 836940) Your efforts in the cause of education, of which your encouragement of the Indian Public Library is only an instance among others, have been characterized by the same unflagging zeal that has pervaded all your public work.
('6', 433, 1, 14, 837163) We know that it is your intention, in order that you may better serve your country, to improve your educational qualifications, and we sincerely trust that your desire will be fulfilled by the grace of the Almighty.
('6', 433, 1, 15, 837379) We wish you a pleasant voyage, a happy time in your home country, and a safe return.
('6', 433, 2, 16, 837464) Presenting the address, Mr. Anglia said that, if he himself had been able to do any public work, it was thanks to Mr. Zaveri for it was his zeal and patriotism that had inspired the speaker.
('6', 433, 2, 17, 837655) Mr. Zaveri used to do a great deal of work himself.
('6', 433, 2, 18, 837707) Besides, he made his men also
('6', 434, 0, 1, 837737) VOL. 6: 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 435
('6', 434, 1, 2, 837780) work for the Congress, prominent among whom was Mr. Chhabildas Mehta.
('6', 434, 1, 3, 837850) He helped a great deal.
('6', 434, 1, 4, 837874) It was impossible to fill the gap caused by Mr. Zaveris departure, but it was hoped that Mr. Dada Osman would more or less make up the loss.
('6', 434, 1, 5, 838015) It was a matter of pleasure that Mr. Rustomjee should have arrived at the right moment.
('6', 434, 1, 6, 838103) The Secretaries were sure to get much assistance from him.
('6', 434, 1, 7, 838162) Mr. Anglia expressed the wish that Mr. Zaveri would become a barrister.
('6', 434, 1, 8, 838234) Speaking about the Asiatic Registration Act, Mr. Anglia said that he had thought of going [to India] on a temporary permit but, as the law had now been passed, he had decided not to apply for a permit in order to show his disapproval of the measure.
('6', 434, 1, 9, 838484) He hoped that the Transvaal Indians would stick to the gaol going resolution and that no Indian would have any relations with the Permit Office.
('6', 434, 2, 10, 838629) ADDRESS BY MEMON [FUND] COMMITTEE
('6', 434, 3, 11, 838663) Mr. Peeran Mahomed, the Joint Secretary of the Memon Committee, read an address on behalf of that organization.
('6', 434, 3, 12, 838775) Here is a translation of it We the members of the Memon Committeewhich was formed to raise funds for helping poor Memons in every possible manner wish to thank you most heartily for your exertions.
('6', 434, 3, 13, 838973) Indeed, you are the founder of the fund, the organizer [of this Committee].
('6', 434, 3, 14, 839049) We can say without the slightest exaggeration that it owes its competence entirely to your devotion to the community, of which you are such an ornament.
('6', 434, 3, 15, 839202) We can hope that, during your temporary absence, we shall be able to keep up the vitality of the Committee and hand it over to your charge when you return.
('6', 434, 4, 16, 839358) ADDRESS BY INDIAN LIBRARY
('6', 434, 5, 17, 839384) Mr. Osman Ahmed Effendi read an address on behalf of the Indian Library.
('6', 434, 5, 18, 839457) The following is a translation:
('6', 434, 6, 19, 839489) We the undersigned, representing the Committee of the Indian Public Library and the visitors to that Library, hereby place on record our deep sense of obligation to you for the very great and tangible help rendered by you to the Library.
('6', 434, 6, 20, 839727) Your love of knowledge is well known, and it was in keeping with it that you rendered so much assistance to this humble institution.
('6', 434, 7, 21, 839860) We trust that you will continue to show goodwill for the Library, and we hope that you will soon return to resume your
('6', 435, 0, 1, 839979) 436 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 435, 1, 2, 840021) multifarious activities in Natal for public causes.
('6', 435, 2, 3, 840073) ADDRESS BY HINDU COMMUNITY
('6', 435, 3, 4, 840100) Mr. R. R. Moodley read the address of the Hindu community.
('6', 435, 3, 5, 840159) Here is a summary of it: We consider it to be our duty to thank you especially on the eve of your departure for India.
('6', 435, 3, 6, 840278) Though a thoroughly religious person, you have never made any distinction between Hindus and Muslims and have thereby won the hearts of both the communities.
('6', 435, 3, 7, 840436) You have endeared yourself to all by your compassionate nature, truthfulness and regard for all.
('6', 435, 3, 8, 840533) You have left us deeply obliged to you by your actions and have created an example worth following.
('6', 435, 3, 9, 840633) We hope that you may reach India safely and, after your safe return, take up your work here again.
('6', 435, 3, 10, 840732) Mr. Paul then garlanded Mr. Zaveri on behalf of the Literary Society and Mr. Ambaram Maharaj on behalf of the Sanatan Dharma Sabha.
('6', 435, 4, 11, 840864) MR. GANDHIS SPEECH
('6', 435, 5, 12, 840883) Mr. Gandhi, who then spoke, said: It is only right that we should present addresses to Mr. Zaveri.
('6', 435, 5, 13, 840982) But Mr. Zaveri will accept our compliments as sincere only if we imitate him in his good qualities which we have praised in the course of our addresses.
('6', 435, 5, 14, 841135) Mr. Zaveri has, however, done nothing for the sake of praise.
('6', 435, 5, 15, 841197) He does not hunger for it and has rendered services to the community out of a sense of duty.
('6', 435, 5, 16, 841290) He has shown by example what true wealth and education consist in.
('6', 435, 5, 17, 841357) By using his wealth mostly in the service of the community, he has shown us the right use for it.
('6', 435, 5, 18, 841455) He thinks that all the education he has acquired is for the sake of the country and uses it for that purpose.
('6', 435, 5, 19, 841565) This is real education.
('6', 435, 5, 20, 841589) Mr. Omar Zaveri believes that the most important means of overcoming Indias misfortunes is unity among Hindus and Muslims.
('6', 435, 5, 21, 841712) Even in India one will rarely find a person who has done as much as Mr. Zaveri to bring about this unity.
('6', 435, 5, 22, 841818) Moreover, Mr. Zaveri possesses the quality of truthfulness, which, besides strengthening each of these three qualities, makes them more attractive and weaves them into a harmonious whole.
('6', 435, 5, 23, 842006) It is only for this reason that we regard him as a true helmsman.
('6', 435, 5, 24, 842072) We can be said truly to have honoured him only if we follow his example.
('6', 435, 5, 25, 842145) It will be difficult for the new Secretary, Mr. Dada
('6', 436, 0, 1, 842198) VOL. 6: 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 437
('6', 436, 1, 2, 842241) Osman, to fill the gap, but he is Mr. Zaveris partner and Mr. Zaveri has unhesitatingly recommended his name to the Congress.
('6', 436, 1, 3, 842367) There is thus reason to believe that Mr. Dada Osman will bring credit to his office.
('6', 436, 1, 4, 842452) Mr. Anglias and Mr. Dada Osmans is thus an exacting burden.
('6', 436, 1, 5, 842512) He can be no ordinary person who can take Mr. Zaveris place.
('6', 436, 1, 6, 842573) We hope that these two gentlemen will faithfully follow Mr. Zaveri in his good qualities.
('6', 436, 1, 7, 842663) Mr. Parsee Rustomjee, who returned that day from India, compared Mr. Omar Zaveri with Sir Pherozeshah Mehta.
('6', 436, 1, 8, 842772) Mr. Abdulla Haji Adam Zaveri said that, as Omar was a close relative of his, he could not but observe that Omar had brought honour to their family.
('6', 436, 1, 9, 842920) He hoped that the Transvaal Indians would never submit to the Transvaal Ordinance.
('6', 436, 1, 10, 843003) He was followed by Dr. Nanji.
('6', 436, 2, 11, 843033) PEERAN MAHOMEDS SPEECH Mr. Peeran Mahomed said: I was Mr. Omar Zaveris neighbour.
('6', 436, 2, 12, 843115) No amount of praise will be enough [to express our gratitude towards him].
('6', 436, 2, 13, 843190) I regard the Transvaal Ordinance as very oppressive.
('6', 436, 2, 14, 843243) If a similar Ordinance comes into force here [in Natal], I say on oath with God as witness that I will never submit to it but go to gaol instead.
('6', 436, 2, 15, 843389) I hope that the Transvaal Indians will do likewise.
('6', 436, 2, 16, 843441) I agree with Mr. Anglia about Mr. Chhabildas Mehta.
('6', 436, 2, 17, 843493) He has served the Congress very ably indeed.
('6', 436, 3, 18, 843538) ISMAIL GORAS SPEECH Mr. Ismail Gora said: I endorse everything that has been said about Mr. Omar Haji Amod Zaveri.
('6', 436, 3, 19, 843653) He has served the community very well.
('6', 436, 3, 20, 843692) As Mr. Rustomjee has returned from India, the work of the Congress will now go on smoothly.
('6', 436, 3, 21, 843784) We have to put up a stiff fight against the Asiatic [Registration] Act.
('6', 436, 3, 22, 843856) The Transvaal Indians can never go back on the Fourth Resolution of September.
('6', 436, 3, 23, 843935) If they do, it will do us much harm.
('6', 436, 3, 24, 843972) The funds of the Natal Indian Congress are exhausted.
('6', 436, 3, 25, 844026) We are in debt to the Bank.
('6', 436, 3, 26, 844054) I therefore hope that the Secretaries will make adequate efforts and collect funds.
('6', 436, 3, 27, 844138) Mr. Chhabildas Mehta said that he could serve the community only because he had an employer such as Mr. Omar Haji Amod Zaveri.
('6', 436, 3, 28, 844265) He had done no more than his duty.

('6', 437, 1, 3, 844439) But I do wish that many more persons like Omar were born in the Indian community.
('6', 437, 1, 4, 844521) I am thankful to the Congress for the honour they have done me by appointing me [a Joint Secretary].
('6', 437, 1, 5, 844622) Of course, the Congress has yet to seeas I have yet to seehow well I serve.
('6', 437, 1, 6, 844698) I shall do my best.
('6', 437, 1, 7, 844718) I am heartened by Mr. Rustomjees arrival and I shall be proud of working with Mr. Anglia.
('6', 437, 2, 8, 844808) ZAVERIS REPLY
('6', 437, 3, 9, 844822) Mr. Zaveri gave a brief but impressive reply to all the addresses.
('6', 437, 3, 10, 844889) He said: The Indian community has overwhelmed me today by giving me a number of parties and presenting me addresses.
('6', 437, 3, 11, 845006) I have not served so well that I deserve all this.
('6', 437, 3, 12, 845057) I did all that I could, as a matter of duty.
('6', 437, 3, 13, 845102) I thank the community for the address presented by the Congress and say that I shall constantly think of [public] service.
('6', 437, 3, 14, 845225) Many gentlemen have expressed their good wishes that I may return from my Haj pilgrimage soon.
('6', 437, 3, 15, 845320) God willing, I shall perform that duty soon indeed.
('6', 437, 3, 16, 845372) I thank the Memon Committee for their address.
('6', 437, 3, 17, 845419) I have done nothing much for them.
('6', 437, 3, 18, 845454) I do not deserve an address from the Library at all.
('6', 437, 3, 19, 845507) It really functions owing to Mr. Motilal Dewans efforts A man following a straight path never loses his way.
('6', 437, 3, 20, 845616) I have endeavoured to serve my community in this manner and hope to do so in the future.

('6', 437, 7, 24, 845772) THE PLAGUE
('6', 437, 8, 25, 845783) A calamity as great as plague has now befallen the Indian community.
('6', 437, 8, 26, 845852) On Fridayafter my last letter was senta cable was received saying that the Imperial Government had assented to the act, which will mean slavery for Indians.
('6', 437, 8, 27, 846009) Every one is asking: what can
('6', 438, 0, 1, 846039) VOL. 6: 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 439
('6', 438, 1, 2, 846082) avail us now?
('6', 438, 1, 3, 846096) But patriotic Indians, as they put the question, immediately realize that this is not an Act designed for our enslavement, but for the loosening of our chains.
('6', 438, 1, 4, 846256) For we must not submit to it, but go to gaol instead.
('6', 438, 1, 5, 846310) Looking at things this way, we should treat it as a blessing that the Act has been passed.
('6', 438, 2, 6, 846401) ENCOUNTER WITH THE STAR"
('6', 438, 3, 7, 846426) Just as a dying {lame burns the brighter, there ensued a duel with The Star when the Act was about to be passed.
('6', 438, 3, 8, 846539) The Star published an article inciting the people against Indians, which was replied to by Mr. Gandhi.
('6', 438, 3, 9, 846642) 1 Afterwards he met the editor of the paper and had a long talk with him.
('6', 438, 3, 10, 846716) The Star then wrote another article which can be considered very polite, but the paper did not drop the quarrel.
('6', 438, 3, 11, 846829) It said that Indians wanted the Government to trust them, and this could not be done.
('6', 438, 3, 12, 846915) Mr. Gandhi wrote once again in reply 2, saying that there was no question of trusting the Indian community for all time.
('6', 438, 3, 13, 847036) It asked to be trusted only this once, and that for a brief period.
('6', 438, 3, 14, 847104) He made many other points besides.
('6', 438, 3, 15, 847139) But there may not be enough space in Indian Opinion this week to publish translations of all of them.
('6', 438, 3, 16, 847241) I would, therefore, recommend the interested reader to read them in full in the English section; the entire letter is good and worth the reading.
('6', 438, 3, 17, 847387) A vivid picture can be had from it of the kind of struggle going on between the whites and Indians, and of its significance.
('6', 438, 3, 18, 847512) It clearly shows that, while the Indian community wants to preserve its self respect, the British say that we wish to kick them down.
('6', 438, 3, 19, 847646) The Stars campaign was obviously on behalf of the local Government and at its instance.
('6', 438, 3, 20, 847734) Though we had very politely asked for interviews with the Rand Pioneers and the Transvaal [Municipal] Association, 3 they were refused.
('6', 438, 3, 21, 847870) What does this signify?
('6', 438, 3, 22, 847894) Only that they treat us like dogs and care little for what we say, which they treat as mere barking.
('6', 438, 3, 23, 847995) No one can now say that the Indians have not done all that was necessary for fulfilling the purpose behind the permit [legislation].
('6', 438, 3, 24, 848128) It is like pretending to be asleep while being wide awake.
('6', 438, 3, 25, 848187) They know very well that the British Indian Associations proposal of voluntary registration does fulfil the objective of the Act in relation to permits.
('6', 438, 3, 26, 848340) In fact, that

('6', 439, 1, 2, 848513) objective is no longer there, but the thought now uppermost in their mind is how to humiliate the Indian community.
('6', 439, 1, 3, 848629) The story of the wolf and the lamb fits this Act.
('6', 439, 1, 4, 848679) When the strong wolf resolved to eat up the poor lamb, he began looking for a pretext for doing so.
('6', 439, 1, 5, 848779) He blamed the lamb for muddying the water which he, the wolf, was to drink.
('6', 439, 1, 6, 848855) When the lamb pointed out that he had really been drinking the water down stream, the wolf replied, If it is not you, then it must have been your father who did that. So saying, he ate up the lamb.
('6', 439, 1, 7, 849053) There is not the slightest difference between our plight and that of the lamb in the fable.
('6', 439, 1, 8, 849145) They wish somehow to show that, even outside the field of politics, we are not their equals.
('6', 439, 1, 9, 849238) That is why they have got this law passed.
('6', 439, 1, 10, 849281) Lord Elgins fear has proved a stronger motive than his inclination to do justice.
('6', 439, 1, 11, 849363) Out of fear of the whites, he has done injustice to the Indians.
('6', 439, 1, 12, 849428) But who can harm one whom Rama protects?
('6', 439, 1, 13, 849469) I see signs that the Indian community will adhere to its gaol going resolution, and the sight fills my heart with joy.
('6', 439, 1, 14, 849588) For the present, at any rate, I feel that the passing of the law has been for us a stroke of luck.
('6', 439, 1, 15, 849687) On all sides people appear filled with enthusiasm at the thought of going to gaol and making themselves happy there as in a palace.
('6', 439, 3, 16, 849819) Something else has transpired which lends much support to these views.
('6', 439, 3, 17, 849890) Mr. Curtis, a sitting member of the local Legislative Assembly, is said to be the sole author of this law.
('6', 439, 3, 18, 849997) He has written to The Times to say that the law should be regarded as having been passed to establish the doctrine that there can be no equality between the whites and the Indians.
('6', 439, 3, 19, 850178) All British subjects should not be regarded as equal.
('6', 439, 3, 20, 850232) In other words, they want to demonstrate our slavery by means of this law.
('6', 439, 3, 21, 850307) They want to prove by it that they have the authority and the right to deal with us in any way they choose, without caring to think whether we like it or not.
('6', 439, 3, 22, 850466) In the measure in which they have obtained self government and become free, they want to make slaves of us.
('6', 439, 3, 23, 850574) The difference between slavery and freedom consists in the manner in which others deal with us.
('6', 439, 3, 24, 850670) If, for the sake of a friend, master or father, I willingly perform the meanest job, I shall win greater respect, my master will think of me as a very loyal servant, and my father will regard me with affection.
('6', 439, 3, 25, 850881) But if I do the same thing under compulsion, men will spit at me, think me a coward and ask why I did not kill myself instead of submitting to such slavery.
('6', 439, 3, 26, 851038) The difference between our condition as it is without the law and what it
('6', 440, 0, 1, 851112) VOL. 6: 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 441
('6', 440, 1, 2, 851155) would be under the law is of comparable magnitude.
('6', 440, 1, 3, 851206) We may put up with being unable to enjoy any rights in regard to land, with having our trade restricted, and with the denial of certain other rights, for there is no use of actual force against us in these matters.
('6', 440, 1, 4, 851421) But the law in question seeks physically to bring compulsion to bear on our persons.
('6', 440, 1, 5, 851506) Just as in India some of us oppress the bhangis and force them to dress in some particular fashion and use obsequious language lest we be polluted by their proximity [sic], it has fallen to our lot to be treated like bhangis here in the Transvaal.
('6', 440, 1, 6, 851754) To remind us perpetually of this status, we are to be obliged to carry permits on our persons.
('6', 440, 1, 7, 851849) When the Pope sent a similar order to the great Luther of Germany through an envoy, he consigned it to the flames in the presence of the envoy and said, Go, tell the Pope that Luther is free from now on.
('6', 440, 1, 8, 852053) Tell him of the fate of his bull. Since that day Luther has remained immortal.
('6', 440, 1, 9, 852132) Millions may want to do what Luther did, but not every one can succeed.
('6', 440, 3, 10, 852204) After reading this news letter, many readers will want to know what we are to do now.
('6', 440, 3, 11, 852290) The answer has already been supplied by Luther.
('6', 440, 3, 12, 852338) We have now earned the freedom to burn old permits, together with the new ones.
('6', 440, 3, 13, 852418) Not a single person must enter the Permit Office, for the situation is really all that hopeless.
('6', 440, 3, 14, 852515) Anyone asking for a permit can do so only under the new law.
('6', 440, 3, 15, 852576) But if the new law is not acceptable to us, we simply cannot apply for a permit.
('6', 440, 3, 16, 852657) The first thing to do therefore is to see that no Indian goes to or communicates with the Permit Office.
('6', 440, 3, 17, 852762) For the rest, we are only to watch and see whatmeasures the Permit Office adopts to force us to take out new permits.
('6', 440, 3, 18, 852880) They will not give Indians as yet the privilege of going to gaol.
('6', 440, 3, 19, 852946) The permit regulations are yet to be framed.
('6', 440, 3, 20, 852991) Then a final date will be fixed for taking out new permits.
('6', 440, 3, 21, 853051) Only after that date can the doors of the prison palace open for us.
('6', 440, 3, 22, 853120) For the present, therefore, we should stay away from the Permit Office to show that we are firm and fearless and determined to implement our Resolution.
('6', 440, 3, 23, 853273) Refugee Indians who are outside [the Colony] and do not hold permits should give up the idea of entering the Transvaal for the present.
('6', 440, 3, 24, 853409) For the necessary permit can only be had under the new law and that no Indian should now ask for.
('6', 440, 3, 25, 853507) I expect all Indians to have faith that the Almighty who rules over the earth has the power to grant us a living even outside the Transvaal; Further clarification can be had by

('6', 441, 2, 3, 853759) LORD ELGINS OINTMENT
('6', 441, 3, 4, 853780) After having inflicted a cruel wound on us, Lord Elgin now seeks to heal it with an ointment of his own make.
('6', 441, 3, 5, 853890) Reuter has cabled that, while replying to a question concerning the Act, it was stated by Mr. Churchill that, during his discussions with General Botha, the latter had mentioned that the regulations under the new Act would be very liberal and would not hurt anyones feelings.
('6', 441, 3, 6, 854166) Reuter also adds that the Members of the House of Commons received the information with applause.
('6', 441, 3, 7, 854264) Only a woman in labour knows the pangs of childbirth.
('6', 441, 3, 8, 854318) The Members of the House of Commons doubtless play the midwife to us.
('6', 441, 3, 9, 854388) Their applause shows that they were touched because our feelings had earlier been hurt.
('6', 441, 3, 10, 854476) But they applauded without realizing the significance of Mr. Churchills reply.
('6', 441, 3, 11, 854555) Lord Elgin seems to be trying to win over children by humouring them.
('6', 441, 3, 12, 854625) After the Act is passed, however liberal the regulations, our condition of slavery will remain unchanged.
('6', 441, 3, 13, 854731) If we are yoked to a cart and the driver holds the reins loose, we do not for that reason cease to be cattle.
('6', 441, 3, 14, 854841) What does it matter if, instead of impressions of all the ten fingers, only one finger print were required, or even if only a signature were required instead of a fingerprint?
('6', 441, 3, 15, 855017) Even so, for reasons which I have explained, we cannot submit to the Act.
('6', 441, 3, 16, 855091) Though we may be given good food and comfort as slaves, these things ought not to turn our heads and make us forget our true state of slavery.
('6', 441, 3, 17, 855234) We have in all humility to inform His Lordship that, as long as compulsory registration is to remain in force, we will not submit to the act, no matter what relief is granted.
('6', 441, 4, 18, 855410) SYMPATHY FROM DURBAN
('6', 441, 5, 19, 855431) Letters of sympathy from Indian leaders in Durban have been received at all places in the Transvaal.
('6', 441, 5, 20, 855532) Our brethren in Natal have advised us to adhere to the gaol going resolution.
('6', 441, 5, 21, 855610) We should be grateful to them for this expression of sympathy.
('6', 441, 5, 22, 855673) Accordingly, a telegram thanking them has already been sent in the name of the Association.

('6', 442, 2, 3, 855899) The special correspondent of The Times of India at Istanbul has reported some interesting facts about the Hejaz Railway.
('6', 442, 2, 4, 856020) Here is a summary of his report.
('6', 442, 2, 5, 856053) The correspondent has passed severe strictures on the railway officials, and he advises all those who wish to give money not to pay so long as the extreme corruption in the railway is not ended.
('6', 442, 2, 6, 856248) He has also sent the photographs of Mr. Kidwai and Mr. Abdul Kadir, the students who had gone to Istanbul with money.
('6', 442, 2, 7, 856366) We have written to the two gentlemen in order to ascertain their views and shall publish their replies when received.
('6', 442, 2, 8, 856484) We cannot say how much truth there is in this report, but The Times of India has given it wide publicitywhich would suggest that there is an element of truth in it.
('6', 442, 3, 9, 856649) ORIGIN OF RAILWAY The man who first mooted the idea of the Hejaz Railway was the notorious Izzet Pasha, who was responsible for the slaughter of Armenians.
('6', 442, 3, 10, 856805) He is one of the self seekers who surround His Majesty the Sultan.
('6', 442, 3, 11, 856872) He hails from Damascus.
('6', 442, 3, 12, 856896) Few people outside Istanbul know that the Sultan lives as a prisoner of the Syrian Pashas at Yildiz Kiosk 1. Being a true Muslim, the Sultan readily approved the Hejaz Railway proposal when it was put before him.
('6', 442, 3, 13, 857109) With a view to suiting everyones convenience, he suggested that the proposed line should connect the harbours at Jidda and Yenbo with Medina and Mecca.
('6', 442, 3, 14, 857261) But his suggestion was not accepted.
('6', 442, 3, 15, 857298) Izzet Pasha persuaded the Sultan to believe that, if the line were started from Jidda, the British were sure to take advantage of it.
('6', 442, 3, 16, 857432) They would set up their own man as Caliph.
('6', 442, 3, 17, 857475) Izzet Pasha had made his own arrangements.
('6', 442, 3, 18, 857518) He had even bought some land.
('6', 442, 3, 19, 857548) He was being helped by Shaikh Abu Handa.
('6', 442, 3, 20, 857589) It was accordingly decided to lay the track between Damascus and Medina.
('6', 442, 4, 21, 857662) FROM DAMASCUS TO MEDINA
('6', 442, 5, 22, 857686) The proposed track is to extend over about 1600 miles, of which 450 miles have been covered by now.
('6', 442, 5, 23, 857786) Last year the profits from this venture amounted to only 61,900. Strenuous efforts are being made to raise subscriptions, but the people of Istanbul do not trust Izzet Pasha.
('6', 442, 5, 24, 857961) No one therefore contributes any money.
('6', 442, 5, 25, 858001) And though all the
('6', 442, 6, 26, 858020) 1 Palace of the Turkish Sultan
('6', 443, 0, 1, 858051) 444 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 443, 1, 2, 858093) officials are required to contribute ten days pay towards the expenditure on the railway, and 2d are collected on every official document also for this purpose, the result will depend entirely on collections made through appeals to the general public.
('6', 443, 1, 3, 858345) It is said that Izzet Pasha has amassed much wealth.
('6', 443, 1, 4, 858398) The Pasha exacts a private commission on all stores purchased.
('6', 443, 1, 5, 858461) An American firm had to pay 3,000 as commission.
('6', 443, 2, 6, 858510) Though the laying of the first section of the line was started in 1901, even a fifth part of the track is not yet complete.
('6', 443, 2, 7, 858634) Even where the line is already in use, no attention is paid to repairs, and, thanks to the inferior quality of the rails, things appear already to have fallen into a bad state.
('6', 443, 2, 8, 858811) The line is altogether useless to Muslims coming from India and China.
('6', 443, 2, 9, 858882) Even among the others very few use the Hejaz Railway, since no one wants to risk travelling on that line.
('6', 443, 3, 10, 858988) INDIAN DEPUTATION
('6', 443, 4, 11, 859006) Some time ago, a deputation of Indian students in Britain went [to Istanbul] with collections.
('6', 443, 4, 12, 859101) They were well received by the Sultan.
('6', 443, 4, 13, 859140) But they were not allowed to visit Damascus, although they wanted to.
('6', 443, 4, 14, 859210) Their movements were watched by the secret police.
('6', 443, 4, 15, 859261) And though they were awarded the Osmania medals and were otherwise well treated, the Pashas were all afraid [of them].
('6', 443, 4, 16, 859380) There are a few Indian Muslims who are in attendance on the Sultan, but they are not fully trusted.
('6', 443, 4, 17, 859480) For the Pashas play upon the religious sentiments of the people for their own profit and do not want their fraud exposed.
('6', 443, 5, 18, 859602) WORKERS
('6', 443, 6, 19, 859610) All the work of laying the railway is done by soldiers, and yet the cost per mile [of track] has amounted to 3,720. Again, for want of sufficient equipment, the trains cannot run faster than twelve miles an hour.
('6', 443, 6, 20, 859823) A former minister of the Sultan told me in the course of a conversation that no one believes that the railway will be useful.
('6', 443, 6, 21, 859949) By the time the southern section is completed, the northern section will have gone out of repair; and one can reach Jidda by sea from Istanbul taking the same time as by train.
('6', 443, 7, 22, 860126) WHAT SHOULD INDIAN MUSLIMS DO?
('6', 443, 8, 23, 860157) The same minister told me further that my Indian friends should not pay a pie unless they can exercise the right of supervision through

('6', 444, 1, 2, 860336) their men and unless they are assured about the laying of a line from Jidda to Mecca.
('6', 444, 1, 3, 860422) Just now there is so much corruption that there is little likelihood of the railway being completed.
('6', 444, 1, 4, 860523) Many of the powerful Viceroys have told the Sultan that, in the name of the railway, regular embezzlement is going on.
('6', 444, 1, 5, 860642) But the agents of Izzet Pasha do not allow anybody to [function] effectively.
('6', 444, 1, 6, 860720) Of the hundreds of thousands of pounds received, nearly 25 per cent have gone into the pockets of corrupt officials.
('6', 444, 1, 7, 860837) Letters are received from the travelling public, in which they complain of scarcity of water, of dearth of other amenities [on the train] and of acute discomfort.
('6', 444, 1, 8, 861000) Fares are also excessively high.
('6', 444, 1, 9, 861033) The third class fare from Damascus to Tebuk is 4, which works out to an anna per mile.
('6', 444, 1, 10, 861120) At present Izzet Pasha is planning to build a new office for the railway in Istanbul at a cost of 50,000. This expenditure is quite unnecessary since there already exist many vacant buildings, but no one gives thought to this chaos.
('6', 444, 2, 11, 861353) CONCLUSION
('6', 444, 3, 12, 861364) The collections have already amounted to 25,00,000. Soldiers are being made to work at nominal wages.
('6', 444, 3, 13, 861466) In five years, only 432 miles of track have been laid.
('6', 444, 3, 14, 861521) The train does not run faster than twelve miles an hour.
('6', 444, 3, 15, 861578) There are 16 engines, two first class and 24 third class carriages only.
('6', 444, 3, 16, 861651) For the rest, passengers are carried in open wagons.
('6', 444, 3, 17, 861704) The passengers travelling in these experience much hardship.
('6', 444, 3, 18, 861765) The railway has got into the hands of cheats and swindlers The Viceroy of Hejaz had sent a telegramto the Sultan, saying that nothing could be done as long as the railway remained in the hands of predatory officials.
('6', 444, 3, 19, 861982) This has proved to be true.
('6', 444, 3, 20, 862010) Hence, says the minister, my request to the Muslims is that they should not send any contributions so long as the robbers remain at their posts and unless a guarantee is given about their removal.

('6', 445, 2, 3, 862317) JOHANNESBURG, May 11, 1907
('6', 445, 3, 4, 862344) TO THE EDITOR THE STAR [JOHANNESBURG]
('6', 445, 4, 5, 862382) SIR, In your letterhead on Mr. Polaks letter regarding the Asiatic Registration Act, you state that the most bitter opponents of the Asiatic trader would, probably, not be sorry if the proposed passive resistance movement resulted in the deportation of the most aggressive agitators.
('6', 445, 4, 6, 862666) Unfortunately for the bitter opponents, so far I have been able to see, there exists no such provision for compulsory deportation, as you seem to think there is.
('6', 445, 4, 7, 862828) If, therefore, their wish is to be satisfied, a new Act will be necessary to drive out of the Colony by physical compulsion those Indians who, in their own opinion, are doing a service to their country and the Empire in their struggle to retain for their countrymen some degree of self respect and manliness.
('6', 445, 4, 8, 863137) You proceed to add:
('6', 445, 5, 9, 863157) Freed from the domination of the latter, we believe the great bulk of British Indians lawfully domiciled in the Transvaal would soon learn to appreciate the greater security which the act confers upon them, and to recognize how much they have been misled as to the real effect of the new legislation.
('6', 445, 5, 10, 863458) One can quite understand your inability to enter into the feelings of British Indians.
('6', 445, 5, 11, 863545) You have misread them entirely if you think that there is a single Indian who is likely, after the withdrawal of the domination (which does not exist), to appreciate the greater security conferred by the Act.
('6', 445, 5, 12, 863754) In spite of my efforts to detect it, I have failed to trace any greater security.
('6', 445, 5, 13, 863836) There can be no question of misleading the mass of the Indians as to the real effect of the new legislation.
('6', 445, 5, 14, 863945) The issue is simple.
('6', 445, 5, 15, 863966) Compulsory registration involves a special restriction on the personal liberty of the subject because of the colour of his skin.
('6', 445, 5, 16, 864095) It has been put before the Indians in the Transvaal that such legislation amounts to a deep humiliation and a kind of
('6', 445, 6, 17, 864213) 1 This was reproduced in Indian Opinion, 18 5 1907.
('6', 446, 0, 1, 864265) VOL. 6: 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 447
('6', 446, 1, 2, 864308) slavery.
('6', 446, 1, 3, 864317) They have, therefore, been advised that they ought not to barter away their present comparative state of freedom for the state prescribed for them by the new legislation, no matter how tempting it may otherwise appear to be.
('6', 446, 1, 4, 864542) The above is the position they will be reduced to, according to my view, under the new legislation.
('6', 446, 1, 5, 864642) In order to avert the degrading blow, I have ventured, also, to tell them, first, that it is their duty firmly and respectfully to decline to submit themselves to re registration under the Act; secondly, that, seeing that the Transvaal is their adopted home and that they are without any voice in the choice of their legislators, the only effective way in which they can make themselves heard is to submit to the ultimate result of a breach of the conditions of the law, namely, to prefer gaol to either re registration or leaving the country or paying the fine; and, thirdly, that, consistently with the above attitude, they should cease to have any communication with the Permit Department, and should ask their friends and other Indians who may wish to re enter the Transvaal not to apply for permits, either temporary or permanent, under the new law.
('6', 446, 1, 6, 865497) If it be said that both the last mentioned points distinctly advance the anti Asiatic purpose, so be it.
('6', 446, 1, 7, 865602) It merely proves what I have often said that the struggle, on the Indian side, is not to grasp as much of the Transvaal trade as possible, but to remain in the country with dignity and self respect, and not to sell their birthright for a mess of pottage.
('6', 446, 1, 8, 865857) I admit, and many English friends have told me, that my advice may not be widely followed.
('6', 446, 1, 9, 865948) I shall still be content if the misgivings of such friends prove to be well founded.
('6', 446, 1, 10, 866033) And, if British Indians choose to submit to the serfdom which the legislation seeks to impose on them, I can only say that we shall have deserved the Registration Act.
('6', 446, 1, 11, 866201) We are undoubtedly put upon our mettle, and it remains to be seen whether, as a body, we shall rise to the occasion.
('6', 446, 1, 12, 866318) I consider that the attitude above sketched is unexceptionable, and I claim for it from the brave colonists not derision but praise.
('6', 446, 1, 13, 866451) But derision or praise, it will be churlish and sinful for myself and my fellow workers to turn aside from a course which has been dictated by a conscientious purpose.

('6', 447, 2, 3, 866739) [JOHANNESBURG,] Sunday, May 12, 1907
('6', 447, 3, 4, 866776) CHHAGANLAL,
('6', 447, 4, 5, 866788) I had intended to write to you a very long letter, but was unable to do so owing to a very severe headache during the train journey.
('6', 447, 4, 6, 866921) The condition continued yesterday, and today it is no better.
('6', 447, 4, 7, 866983) My health seems to have been seriously affected by my exertions in Durban this time.
('6', 447, 4, 8, 867068) However, I feel confident of regaining my health through sufficient rest, earth treatment, etc.
('6', 447, 4, 9, 867164) I have sent some matter today.
('6', 447, 4, 10, 867195) I expect to write or dictate more tonight.
('6', 447, 4, 11, 867238) When I heard about the balance sheet, it immediately occurred to me that it was desirableindeed it was our dutyto give Thakkar an increment without his asking for it.
('6', 447, 4, 12, 867405) I believe he is very useful to us.
('6', 447, 4, 13, 867440) Despite some of his bad habits, he is strong on two points: his determined patriotism and his celibacy.
('6', 447, 4, 14, 867544) His work is on the whole satisfactory.
('6', 447, 4, 15, 867583) I would therefore specially advise you to give him an increment immediately.
('6', 447, 4, 16, 867660) When I discussed this with Maganlal, I had thought of giving him one pound, but now I think it would be enough if you gave him half a pound for the present.
('6', 447, 4, 17, 867817) Maganlal had suggested to me that Miss West should also be paid something.
('6', 447, 4, 18, 867892) I much appreciate that idea also and feel it better that the rest of you should think of doing so before the idea occurs to Mr. West.
('6', 447, 4, 19, 868026) I would advise immediate action in regard to both these things.
('6', 447, 4, 20, 868090) Do please read Ruskins book 1. Always think about your teaching method while giving lessons to Anandlal and Harilal and make constant improvements in it.
('6', 447, 4, 21, 868244) Please give Dada Sheth the boards that he has asked for.
('6', 447, 4, 22, 868301) I hope you have sent the additional copies I wrote to you about yesterday.
('6', 447, 4, 23, 868376) Hemchand will probably leave by the end of June at the latest.
('6', 447, 4, 24, 868439) He is thinking of passing through Delagoa Bay.
('6', 447, 4, 25, 868486) Please send me the name and address of the person who is working for us in Delagoa Bay.

('6', 449, 7, 10, 870526) In order to make the letter heads appear artistic, you will have to use your judgement as to how they should be printed.
('6', 449, 7, 11, 870647) What I think is that you could have the English in the form of an arch, and underneath the arch you could have the Hindi and Gujarati equivalent[s] in parallel columns.
('6', 449, 7, 12, 870816) This is with reference to the title of the Sabha.
('6', 449, 7, 13, 870866) The address will follow in the three languages, one after the other.
('6', 449, 7, 14, 870935) The top with the mystic syllable Om may appear only in Hindi.
('6', 449, 7, 15, 870997) It should be on ruled paper, 500 foolscap and 500 Bank 1. I have told them that it will be about 25/ for the whole order, but, if it is more, let it be more.
('6', 449, 7, 16, 871155) Send your bill to the Sabha, Box 33, Germiston, at the same time that you send the letter heads.

('6', 450, 4, 10, 872170) [JOHANNESBURG,] May 18, 1907
('6', 450, 5, 11, 872199) MY DEAR CHHAGANLAL,
('6', 450, 6, 12, 872219) I have your letter.
('6', 450, 6, 13, 872239) I think I threw off the headache on Thursday, but, though I am feeling much better, I do not want to give myself over much work yet.
('6', 450, 6, 14, 872372) The treatment I gave myself was two local earth bandages and two abdominal bandages, and rest up to seven oclock in the morning, instead of six.
('6', 450, 6, 15, 872517) The real thing was as much rest at night as possible.
('6', 450, 6, 16, 872571) I am glad you have decided to adopt my suggestion with regard to increase in extra copies.
('6', 450, 6, 17, 872662) I shall ask Hemchand to send you a list of the number of copies sold this week.
('6', 450, 6, 18, 872742) Many, I know, are still left, but that does not matter.
('6', 450, 6, 19, 872798) How many extra copies did you sell on your side?
('6', 450, 6, 20, 872847) Hemchand must go home, because I do not want to apply for an extension of his permit as it would fall under the new law; and as I have advised them to do likewise, to be consistent, I must not get an extension for Hemchand.
('6', 450, 6, 21, 873071) Hemchand thinks he will save a little money by going through Delagoa Bay, and see the place also.
('6', 450, 6, 22, 873169) At the same time, if there is any reason why he should go through Durban, he will do so.
('6', 450, 6, 23, 873258) With reference to the block, I propose to charge the Association for it.
('6', 450, 6, 24, 873331) That being so, I have told you that copies of the supplement should not be sold by themselves, nor should you advertise them for sale, as you advertise other supplements.
('6', 450, 6, 25, 873502) If we sell those supplements, we can only credit the Association with the amount, which is hardly
('6', 451, 0, 1, 873600) 452 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 451, 1, 2, 873642) worth while.
('6', 451, 1, 3, 873655) The Advertiser article is simply contemptible.
('6', 451, 1, 4, 873702) You know how to treat the vaccination marks.
('6', 451, 1, 5, 873747) If not, you should look up Dr. Tribhowans book, which is, I believe, with you.
('6', 451, 1, 6, 873826) I shall try to secure names for the Directory here.
('6', 451, 1, 7, 873878) You may take out the advertisement of E. Ebrahim of Standerton.
('6', 451, 1, 8, 873942) I do not despair of collecting the amount.

('6', 451, 8, 16, 874323) We had occasion to congratulate Mr. Joseph Royeppen and his relatives on the formers having graduated at Cambridge.
('6', 451, 8, 17, 874439) We have now the pleasure of congratulating them on Mr. Royeppens having passed his Bar Final examination.
('6', 451, 8, 18, 874545) He may now be in our midst any day.
('6', 451, 8, 19, 874581) That would bring up the total of Indian barristers practising here to four.
('6', 451, 8, 20, 874657) In our opinion, the usefulness of the liberal education received by them can be measured only in so far as they use it for the advancement of their countrymen.
('6', 451, 8, 21, 874817) Of all the countries in the world, perhaps India today, whether within her own borders or outside, has the greatest need of the talents possessed by her sons, and we hold that, before Indians who have received a liberal educations can make such public use thereof, they will have to adopt voluntary poverty.
('6', 451, 8, 22, 875125) Indeed, we are not sure that it is not the duty of every man to limit his personal pecuniary ambition.
('6', 451, 8, 23, 875228) Whether, however, the larger proposition can be sufficiently proved or not, the smaller one we have already laid down is indisputable.
('6', 451, 8, 24, 875363) Apart from the work of securing ordinary civil rights for their countrymen in South Africa, Indians like Mr. Royeppen can do a vast amount of useful and quiet work in the way of internal and social reform.

('6', 452, 4, 5, 875920) Forward ye all to battle, the bugles sound Raise the cry and take the plunge, for victorys around.
('6', 452, 4, 6, 876019) There are deeds that may not be tarried, Doubts, fears ever abound, and courage is harried; They waste the days saying the time is not yet No such excuse ever did bring profit.
('6', 452, 4, 7, 876196) By plunging in and savouring success is strength found.
('6', 452, 4, 8, 876252) Raise the cry and take the plunge, for victorys around.
('6', 452, 4, 9, 876308) Through adventure did Columbus to the New World make his trip; Through adventure did Napoleon have enemies in his grip; Through adventure Martin Luther did the Pope defy; Through adventure did Scott his debts re pay; Through adventure did Alexander have his name resound.
('6', 452, 4, 10, 876580) Raise the cry and take the plunge, for victorys around.
('6', 452, 5, 11, 876636) Thus sang the poet 2. The song deserves to be learnt off by heart by every Indian, especially in the Transvaal.
('6', 452, 5, 12, 876748) Let him grasp its meaning in full, and then plunge into the fight, regardless of consequences.
('6', 452, 5, 13, 876843) The more we think about the Transvaal Act, the more we feel that it is to be shunned like a viper.
('6', 452, 5, 14, 876942) The spirit of enterprise is essential for this.
('6', 452, 5, 15, 876990) As the poet puts it, this matter brooks no delay, and fear is likely to sap our courage.
('6', 452, 5, 16, 877079) Let us, then, have no fear.
('6', 452, 5, 17, 877107) As the Gujarati saying has it, doubt is like a ghost and selfishness like a witch.
('6', 452, 5, 18, 877190) Accordingly, if we go on having doubts, there will be no end to them.

('6', 453, 1, 2, 877374) Once free from doubt, we shall win resounding success in the end.
('6', 453, 1, 3, 877440) Whatever the excuse offered by anyone, believe it to arise from fear.
('6', 453, 1, 4, 877510) Let every Indian expel the witch of fear and resolve that, whatever others might do, he for his part would go to gaol rather than submit to the new Act.
('6', 453, 1, 5, 877663) If that happens, we shall see in the end that no Indian will be cowardly enough to take out a new permit.
('6', 453, 1, 6, 877769) Columbus kept up his courage even when his sailors, one and all, threatened his life.
('6', 453, 1, 7, 877855) That is how he discovered America and became famous throughout the world.
('6', 453, 1, 8, 877929) Napoleon, a youth from the island of Corsica, shook all Europe.
('6', 453, 1, 9, 877993) Hundreds of thousands of men did his bidding.
('6', 453, 1, 10, 878039) When the Pope sent Luther the bull of excommunication, he tore it up and became free.
('6', 453, 1, 11, 878125) The great poet Scott proved himself a man of his word, despite old age, and went on writing, earning enough to pay off his debts.
('6', 453, 1, 12, 878255) Everyone has heard of Alexanders Empire.
('6', 453, 1, 13, 878296) With such examples before them, how can the Transvaal Indians lose heart even in the smallest degree?
('6', 453, 1, 14, 878398) Letters have continued to pour in, which show that the writers would never go back on the pledge taken in September.
('6', 453, 1, 15, 878515) However, if the Indian community breaks that pledge and retracts, this is what we think the future holds for us.
('6', 453, 1, 16, 878628) If the Indian community takes out the permits which are compulsory under the new Act, then in a short time 1. the trade licences in the Transvaal will be discontinued;
('6', 453, 2, 17, 878796) 2. almost all the Indians will be required to live and carry on their trade in Locations;
('6', 453, 3, 18, 878886) 3. the Malay Location will be lost to us and its present residents will be required to go to Klipspruit;
('6', 453, 4, 19, 878991) 4. all hope of getting land rights will have to be given up;
('6', 453, 5, 20, 879052) 5. the foot path regulation will be applied to Indians;
('6', 453, 6, 21, 879108) 6. many more of the trade licences in Natal will be cancelled next year; and
('6', 453, 7, 22, 879185) 7. a Registration Act like the one in the Transvaal will be introduced throughout South Africa.
('6', 453, 8, 23, 879281) What Indian would care to live in South Africa under these circumstances?
('6', 453, 8, 24, 879355) We do not guarantee that all the rights referred to above will be secured if the new Act is opposed.
('6', 453, 8, 25, 879456) There is, however, a possibility of at least some of them being granted.
('6', 453, 8, 26, 879529) But whether we get them or not, the

('6', 454, 1, 3, 879793) Ones good name must not be sacrificed, whatever the cost.
('6', 454, 1, 4, 879851) The good name of the Indian community will then have been saved.

('6', 454, 5, 8, 879982) There has been a fresh defeat for Indians in the matter of licences, and this calls for second thoughts.
('6', 454, 5, 9, 880087) The Ladysmith struggle is to be treated as part of the struggle all over the Transvaal.
('6', 454, 5, 10, 880175) We hope that no Indian will wind up his business.
('6', 454, 5, 11, 880225) In the Transvaal an Indian not taking out a permit will go to gaol; but it is not so in Natal.
('6', 454, 5, 12, 880320) For, according to the [Dealers] Licenses Act, one can only be fined for carrying on business without a licence.
('6', 454, 5, 13, 880432) There is no provision for imprisonment in default of fine.
('6', 454, 5, 14, 880491) This appears confusing at first sight, in fact there is no confusion here.
('6', 454, 5, 15, 880566) If the fine imposed under the Act for trading without a licence is not paid, the Government will have the right to recover it by attaching and selling the shopkeepers stocks.
('6', 454, 5, 16, 880741) This is not the time for people to be afraid of such things.
('6', 454, 5, 17, 880802) Only when we allow our goods to be sold in this manner will the eyes of the Government be opened to the magnitude of the oppression inflicted on us.
('6', 454, 5, 18, 880951) As for the situation in Ladysmith, we know that the Govern ment itself is displeased with the Ladysmith regulation.
('6', 454, 5, 19, 881067) Very likely no one will be prosecuted.
('6', 454, 5, 20, 881106) But things will become difficult if what happened at Ladysmith today happens elsewhere.
('6', 454, 5, 21, 881194) Just as we must show courage [at the prospect] of going to gaol, so must we show courage and face [a possible] confiscation of our goods.
('6', 454, 5, 22, 881332) Here too we can point to the example of Englishmen themselves.
('6', 454, 5, 23, 881395) When two years ago the Education Act was enforced in England, many people were reluctant to pay the Education Cess.
('6', 454, 5, 24, 881511) There was only one way of collesting the tax from those who refused to pay it: that was to attach and sell their goods.
('6', 454, 5, 25, 881631) Those who were displeased by the tax refused to pay it and allowed their goods to be sold, with the result that the Act is about to be repealed.
('6', 454, 5, 26, 881776) In our opinion, the same course has to be taken if the licence menace becomes serious and no redress can be had by
('6', 455, 0, 1, 881891) 456 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 455, 1, 2, 881933) other means.
('6', 455, 1, 3, 881946) While adopting this course, we should ensure that the shops and houses of Indian traders and their account books are all kept in order.
('6', 455, 1, 4, 882082) We also hold that, if the Indian community in the Transvaal makes good its pledge, it will have good results in Natal too.

('6', 455, 5, 8, 882266) When the news of the passing of the new Act was received, The Star published a forceful cartoon.
('6', 455, 5, 9, 882363) It shows the whites and the Indians playing a game of chess.
('6', 455, 5, 10, 882424) With the permission of The Star, we reproduce the cartoon elsewhere with our own cartoon in reply.
('6', 455, 5, 11, 882523) According to The Star, the black king has mounted an attack on the Transvaal rook.
('6', 455, 5, 12, 882606) The white knight; if it can enter the Ordinance square, will be in a position to check the black king.
('6', 455, 5, 13, 882709) Now that the Bill has become law, the white knight can move into the Ordinance square and force the black king into the Indian square.
('6', 455, 5, 14, 882844) The white knight is pleased.
('6', 455, 5, 15, 882873) In the cartoon which we publish in reply, it is shown that the square of the gaol going resolution is occupied by a black pawn.
('6', 455, 5, 16, 883001) The white knight in its hurry has overlooked the black pawn which guards the Ordinance square and the fact that it cannot move into the Ordinance square as long as the black pawn is on the gaol square.
('6', 455, 5, 17, 883203) It is further suggested that what in its blind hurry the white knight takes to be the black king is really not a king; it can only be a poor pawn.
('6', 455, 5, 18, 883350) The Star has attached so much importance to the Ordinance.
('6', 455, 5, 19, 883409) It has charged the Indians with overrunning the Transvaal.
('6', 455, 5, 20, 883468) All this shows that the new Act is not a trivial matter.
('6', 455, 5, 21, 883525) We commend this drawing to every Indian for careful study.

('6', 455, 9, 25, 883656) The boycott was first started by the Chinese last year.

('6', 456, 1, 2, 883833) wishing to enter the Transvaal, need not go to such lengths as the Chinese, but they should support the resolution on gaol going, for implementing which it is necessary to suspend all business with the Permit Office.
('6', 456, 1, 3, 884050) In Durban, no Indian should go to Mr. Burgesss office.
('6', 456, 1, 4, 884105) In Pretoria likewise, no Indian should go to the Permit Office, or enter into any correspondence with it.
('6', 456, 1, 5, 884211) It can be readily seen that, if we do not accept the new Ordinance, we cannot now go anywhere near the Permit Office, since all applications to the Permit Office made now will be treated as having been made under the new Act.
('6', 456, 1, 6, 884437) We must not remain inactive on the ground that the new Act is not yet published in the Gazette.
('6', 456, 1, 7, 884533) We were glad to learn that Mr. Mahomed Cassim Anglia, who had applied for a permit, intends to withdraw his application.
('6', 456, 1, 8, 884654) Mr. Osman Ahmed intends to do the same.
('6', 456, 1, 9, 884694) This news should fill us with enthusiasm.
('6', 456, 1, 10, 884736) Every Indian should do the same.
('6', 456, 1, 11, 884769) Now, considering the matter carefully, what can we gain by having anything to do with the Permit Office?
('6', 456, 1, 12, 884874) What difference will it make [to our situation] if three or four Indians are able to enter the Transvaal [as a result of our dealings with the Permit Office]?
('6', 456, 1, 13, 885033) And what harm will be done if they cannot?
('6', 456, 1, 14, 885076) We hope that in view of the damage that is likely to be done to [the interests of the] entire Indian community if any business is done with that Office, every Indian will boycott it, as suggested by the British Indian Association.
('6', 456, 1, 15, 885307) On reflection, we think that young Indians, and others who have anything to do with the Permit Office, should break off all relations with it, and persuade others to do likewise.
('6', 456, 1, 16, 885486) A couple of men can stand near the Office entrance by turns and if anyone wishes to go in, dissuade him from doing so.

('6', 456, 5, 20, 885671) In Western countries education is so highly valued that senior teachers are treated with much respect.
('6', 456, 5, 21, 885774) There are at present in England schools that have been running for hundreds of years and have turned out many renowned men.
('6', 456, 5, 22, 885898) One of these famous schools is Eton.
('6', 456, 5, 23, 885935) A few months ago the Old Boys of Eton presented an address to the Head Master, Dr. Weir, who is well known throughout the British
('6', 457, 0, 1, 886065) 458 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 457, 1, 2, 886107) Empire.
('6', 457, 1, 3, 886115) Writing about the occasion, The Pall Mall Gazette, a well known journal in England, has explained the nature of real education.
('6', 457, 1, 4, 886243) Its comments deserve the attention of us all The writer in The Pall Mall Gazette says: We hold that real education does not consist merely in acquainting oneself with ancient or modern books.
('6', 457, 1, 5, 886435) It consists in the habits which one knowingly or unknowingly imbibes from the atmosphere, ones surroundings and the company one keeps and above all in work.
('6', 457, 1, 6, 886592) It is all very well to acquire a stock of knowledge from good books or from other sources.
('6', 457, 1, 7, 886683) But the more important thing is to learn humanity.
('6', 457, 1, 8, 886734) The primary function of teachers is, therefore, not to teach the alphabet, but to inculcate humanity.
('6', 457, 1, 9, 886836) Aristotle said that virtue is not learnt by reading big volumes.
('6', 457, 1, 10, 886901) It is by doing good deeds that we learn virtue.
('6', 457, 1, 11, 886949) Another great writer also says that it is well for one to know what isgood, but one will be considered a happy person only if one Acts upon that knowledge.
('6', 457, 2, 12, 887105) Judged by these standards, English schools will not be found wanting.
('6', 457, 2, 13, 887175) If we think of English schools as places for turning out human beings, we shall see that they give us statesmen and administrators.
('6', 457, 2, 14, 887307) Those educated in German schools may have greater knowledge, but if they become also men of action like the pupils of Eton, it is not by virtue of their training in the schools.
('6', 457, 2, 15, 887485) Despite the defects that may exist in English schools, it is these that produce true men.
('6', 457, 2, 16, 887575) They are men who are ever ready to meet an enemy threatening at the gates of England.
('6', 457, 2, 17, 887661) We can readily realize how a country that invests education with such a noble purpose becomes prosperous.
('6', 457, 2, 18, 887767) Indias star will shine bright when Indian children receive such education.
('6', 457, 2, 19, 887842) Parents, teachers and pupils ought to ponder over the passage quoted above.
('6', 457, 2, 20, 887918) It would not do merely to know it, it is necessary to Act upon it.
('6', 457, 2, 21, 887985) That is to say, parents should provide for excellent education, teachers should discharge their responsibility and pupils should recognize that mere literacy is not education.

('6', 458, 2, 3, 888271) MIRACLE OF GAOL GOING
('6', 458, 3, 4, 888293) In the Transvaal and, if I am not mistaken, all over South Africa, Indians are discussing the gaol going resolution.
('6', 458, 3, 5, 888410) They feel certain that the Transvaal Indians will court imprisonment.
('6', 458, 3, 6, 888480) Some say that gaol is a palace; others look upon it as a beautiful garden.
('6', 458, 3, 7, 888555) Yet others consider it paradise.
('6', 458, 3, 8, 888588) Again there are some who think that gaol will prove to be a key which will unshackle the Indians.
('6', 458, 3, 9, 888686) Some others hold that, through the gaol gates, we shall pass from our present bondage to freedom.
('6', 458, 3, 10, 888784) Thus in their several ways, people have shown enthusiasm about going to gaol.
('6', 458, 3, 11, 888862) There are also some who, when the enthusiasm wanes, start worrying about what will happen to this person or that, and get into a panic.
('6', 458, 3, 12, 888998) I have received a few letters of this kind and the questions they raise do deserve not to be rejected out of hand.
('6', 458, 3, 13, 889113) For if we are to achieve success in the end, we should provide for the difficulties that are being felt.
('6', 458, 3, 14, 889218) Indian Opinion as well as the Association has received some letters to this effect.
('6', 458, 3, 15, 889302) I reply to them all in this letter and, on behalf of the Association, I apologize to the writers for its inability to answer them individually.
('6', 458, 3, 16, 889446) I do not refer to the writers by name as this is unnecessary.
('6', 458, 4, 17, 889508) WHAT SHOULD TRADERS DO?
('6', 458, 5, 18, 889532) An Indian writes that his shop is run by him and his son, and that he has debts to pay.
('6', 458, 5, 19, 889620) What should they do if they are both arrested?
('6', 458, 5, 20, 889667) To this question there can be many answers.
('6', 458, 5, 21, 889711) First, let me give the one that comes readily to mind.
('6', 458, 5, 22, 889766) Reply 1. Going to gaol is a great adventure, which will benefit not only the person concerned; but all the Transvaal Indians and, in fact, the Indian community as a whole.
('6', 458, 5, 23, 889938) To win such great benefits, one must put up with whatever loss may occur.
('6', 458, 5, 24, 890012) I believe that going to gaol will please Khuda or Ishwar.
('6', 458, 5, 25, 890070) The Creator always helps us in anything we do in fear of Him.
('6', 458, 5, 26, 890132) We reap the fruit of our labour in proportion to our faith in Him.
('6', 458, 5, 27, 890199) The Prophet Mahomed and his disciples were once in a cave.
('6', 458, 5, 28, 890258) A whole army was marching towards them.
('6', 458, 5, 29, 890298) The disciples cried out in fear: O Prophet!
('6', 458, 5, 30, 890342) We are only three, and the army consists of hundreds of men.
('6', 458, 5, 31, 890403) How shall we save ourselves? The Prophet replied, We are not just three.
('6', 458, 5, 32, 890476) God, Who is a match for all, is
('6', 459, 0, 1, 890508) 460 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 459, 1, 2, 890550) also with us. It was owing to such superhuman faith that the Prophet succeeded in all that he attempted.
('6', 459, 1, 3, 890655) The enemy could not do him the least harm.
('6', 459, 1, 4, 890698) They passed the cave by; it did not occur to them even to look in.
('6', 459, 1, 5, 890765) Likewise, if we turn to the Hindu scriptures, we find Prahlad, a steadfast devotee of God, who remained unharmed even when made to embrace a red hot pillar, because he too had unshakable faith in Gods help.
('6', 459, 1, 6, 890972) In the same way, for an Indian who undertakes this adventure with Khuda as witness, there is nothing more to think about.
('6', 459, 1, 7, 891094) The great God, the protector of the faithful and the preserver of their honour, is present everywhere and at all times.
('6', 459, 1, 8, 891214) This reply implies reliance on fate.
('6', 459, 1, 9, 891251) But, as we know, fate without human effort is of no avail.
('6', 459, 1, 10, 891310) Hence, we need to think of other things too.
('6', 459, 1, 11, 891355) Reply 2. While thinking of human effort, we have always to bear the first reply in mind.
('6', 459, 1, 12, 891444) For those who cannot fully and sincerely trust in God, there is a remedy indicated by Mr. Coovadia: that is, even if all the men working in a shop are arrested simultaneously, they should go to gaol.
('6', 459, 1, 13, 891644) After returning from gaol, someone not the proprietor of the shopmight take out a permit (not with the intention of obeying the law, but with that of getting it repealed) and run the shop.
('6', 459, 1, 14, 891833) Every person will thus come out of gaol well trained.
('6', 459, 1, 15, 891887) Reply 3. If anyone finds it difficult to Act up to Reply 2, permits for all persons other than the proprietor of the shop may be taken out on the last day fixed in the Gazette for the purpose.
('6', 459, 1, 16, 892080) Reply 4. The reader will remember what I said earlier: before it becomes necessary for an Indian to go to gaol, he will receive a notice to quit the Transvaal.
('6', 459, 1, 17, 892240) 1 He will be arrested after the expiry of the notice period, then sentenced to pay a fine and to imprisonment in case of default.
('6', 459, 1, 18, 892370) One must then go to gaol instead of paying the fine.
('6', 459, 1, 19, 892423) It will thus be possible for the trader, during the notice period, to make over his goods to his creditors.
('6', 459, 1, 20, 892531) For the small trader this will be the best remedy.
('6', 459, 1, 21, 892582) He is unlikely to find any difficulty in earning his daily bread after release from gaol.
('6', 459, 2, 22, 892672) WHAT OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN?
('6', 459, 3, 23, 892700) The Act gives [the Government] no power to arrest women, and children under sixteen.
('6', 459, 3, 24, 892785) They will thus have to suffer nothing more

('6', 460, 1, 2, 892924) than separation from husband or father.
('6', 460, 1, 3, 892964) As for their maintenance, the answer has already been given that the Indian community will look after them.
('6', 460, 1, 4, 893072) It is to be remembered that all the thirteen thousand Indians will not have to go to gaol at the same time.
('6', 460, 1, 5, 893180) If, however, this should happen, our deliverance would be immediate.
('6', 460, 1, 6, 893249) Since all the Indians will not be going to gaol at the same time, there will always be a few people outside to look after one another.
('6', 460, 2, 7, 893384) WHAT IS A VALID PERMIT?
('6', 460, 3, 8, 893408) A correspondent has raised a further query.
('6', 460, 3, 9, 893452) Anyone who has obtained a permit after making a true affidavit and whose permit bears his signature or thumb impression is the holder of a valid permit, irrespective of whether or not he is a refugee.
('6', 460, 3, 10, 893653) Only these [that is, holders of valid permits] are to live on in the Transvaal and court imprisonment.
('6', 460, 4, 11, 893756) WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO MEN IN SMALL VILLAGES?
('6', 460, 4, 12, 893799) This question has been asked by a correspondent from Belfast.
('6', 460, 4, 13, 893861) The answer to this is contained for the most part in the foregoing replies.
('6', 460, 4, 14, 893937) If, however, the villages come in for attack first, Mr. Gandhi will very probably rush there.
('6', 460, 4, 15, 894031) Even if he happens to be busy in another part of the Transvaal, the people need not at all be afraid.
('6', 460, 4, 16, 894133) When an officer comes to investigate, whatever permit one holds should be shown to him.
('6', 460, 4, 17, 894221) He should be told that taking out a new permit is humiliating to us and that it would never happen.
('6', 460, 4, 18, 894321) If he asks for any finger prints other than the thumb impression, these should be flatly refused.
('6', 460, 4, 19, 894419) If a notice is served on anyone, information should be immediately sent to the Association with particulars, such as name, address, etc.
('6', 460, 4, 20, 894556) On the expiry of the notice period, he should appear before the court and accept whatever gaol sentence is awarded.
('6', 460, 4, 21, 894672) If a fine is imposed, it should not be paid.
('6', 460, 4, 22, 894717) It is necessary that every Indian everywhere should communicate these instructions to those who may not know about them.
('6', 460, 4, 23, 894838) BOYS OVER SIXTEEN Questions on this subject have been asked from Petersburg.
('6', 460, 4, 24, 894915) No boy, as long as he is under sixteen, will be arrested.
('6', 460, 4, 25, 894973) Boys who are over sixteen, whether or not they hold permits or other documents, are in the same situation as the holders of valid permits.
('6', 460, 5, 26, 895112) WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO EXISTING PERMITS?
('6', 460, 5, 27, 895150) A correspondent from Lindleyspoort seeks to know what will happen to those who hold permits now, but go to India on business
('6', 461, 0, 1, 895275) 462 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 461, 1, 2, 895317) while the struggle is on, and then wish to return.
('6', 461, 1, 3, 895368) He asks whether their permits will hold good then.
('6', 461, 1, 4, 895419) For those who are preparing to go to gaol, this question will not arise.
('6', 461, 1, 5, 895492) For no one can tell what the end of the struggle will be.
('6', 461, 1, 6, 895550) However, generally speaking, the reply to this question is that such a permit holder will probably find no difficulty in returning.
('6', 461, 2, 7, 895682) HOW TO ACT DURING POLICE INVESTIGATION
('6', 461, 3, 8, 895721) A correspondent from Volkstroom asks: what are the police to be told when they come to investigate?
('6', 461, 3, 9, 895821) What is to be done if the police forcibly take away the permits?
('6', 461, 3, 10, 895886) The answer to these questions is only this: produce the permit when they come.
('6', 461, 3, 11, 895965) If required, give one thumb impression only.
('6', 461, 3, 12, 896010) If asked to take out new permits, refuse to do so, and say that you have no intention at all of taking out one, and that, if, for not doing so, the Government sends you to gaol, you will be ready for it.
('6', 461, 3, 13, 896214) The police do not have the authority to take away permits by force.
('6', 461, 3, 14, 896282) Therefore, if they threaten you in any way, reply boldly that you will not give up the permit.
('6', 461, 3, 15, 896377) If any such thing happens, report it to the Association.
('6', 461, 3, 16, 896434) The same person also inquires what arrangements will be made for the dependants of those who go to gaol according to the Fourth Resolution, and whether the Association will pay the counsels fees, etc.
('6', 461, 3, 17, 896635) Answers to these questions have already been given above.
('6', 461, 4, 18, 896693) CURTISS LETTER Mr. Curtis has addressed a letter to The Times of London.
('6', 461, 4, 19, 896766) A comment on it has already appeared in this journal.
('6', 461, 4, 20, 896820) 1 The whole letter is reproduced in The Star.
('6', 461, 4, 21, 896866) It is not necessary to offer a translation of it, as most of the facts in it are a matter of history.
('6', 461, 4, 22, 896968) There are, however, some points in the letter that deserve to be noted.
('6', 461, 4, 23, 897040) For Mr. Curtis is a member of the Council, and importance will always be attached to his statements.
('6', 461, 4, 24, 897141) Every Indian will therefore have to think about the matter.
('6', 461, 4, 25, 897201) Mr. Curtis says: (I) that Englishmen and Indians ought never to have equal rights; (2) that the law which has been enacted lays down quite properly that their rights are not equal (3) that this law is onlt the beginning of a series of many similar laws to come; and

('6', 462, 1, 2, 897594) (4) that Lord Selbornes promise that no new Indian would be allowed into the Transvaal should be honoured.
('6', 462, 2, 3, 897701) Mr. Curtis goes on to make other points, but those mentioned above are sufficient to put the Indian community on its guard.
('6', 462, 2, 4, 897825) The letter shows that the Transvaal Act is intended not merely to provide for registration, but to humiliate us also, to show that we are not their [the whites] equals in any way, and to brand us as slaves.
('6', 462, 2, 5, 898032) From the letter one thing at least becomes certain: if the Act comes into force, and if we submit to it, instead of fresh rights being granted to us, we shall be deprived of what little remains to us, not merely in the Transvaal, but all over South Africa.
('6', 462, 2, 6, 898289) We shall, therefore, do well to remember what kind of law this is.
('6', 462, 2, 7, 898356) It will be better for every worthy son of India to leave the Colony or commit suicide than to submit to a law with such dire consequences.
('6', 462, 2, 8, 898495) Mr. Polak, the editor of this journal, has given Mr. Curtis a biting and powerful reply.
('6', 462, 2, 9, 898584) There is no time for translating it here.
('6', 462, 2, 10, 898626) But it may be read in the English section.
('6', 462, 3, 11, 898669) WELL DONE, STANDERTON!
('6', 462, 4, 12, 898692) The Indian community in Standerton has been carrying on a vigorous campaign against the new Act.
('6', 462, 4, 13, 898789) A correspondent of The Star went there to interview the local leaders.
('6', 462, 4, 14, 898860) They told him plainly that Indians thought nothing of the hardships of imprisonment as compared to those that would result from submission to the new Act.
('6', 462, 4, 15, 899015) They were well prepared to resist it, and had even raised funds for the purpose; but they would never submit to it.
('6', 462, 4, 16, 899131) I hope that, following the example of Standerton, every Indian everywhere will boldly give the same reply.
('6', 462, 4, 17, 899238) Now that we are on the battle field, we have nothing to fear and nothing to hide.
('6', 462, 5, 18, 899320) THREAT BY THE STAR The editor of The Star was somewhat piqued that the Klerksdorp Indians should have held a meeting about gaol going.
('6', 462, 5, 19, 899455) Mr. Polak therefore replied to him that not only in Klerksdorp but in Germiston and other places also such meetings had been held and that news was coming in from all over concerning the gaol going resolution.
('6', 462, 5, 20, 899665) This has enraged the editor all the more.
('6', 462, 5, 21, 899707) He has said in his comment that there were only a few leaders who were inciting the Indiancommunity, and that, if they were deported, the other Indians would not utter a word but would cheerfully accept the new Act.
('6', 462, 5, 22, 899923) Mr. Gandhi has replied to him as follows:
('6', 463, 0, 1, 899965) 464 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 463, 1, 2, 900007) GANDHIS REPLY1
('6', 463, 2, 3, 900022) You say in your leaderette that those who oppose the Indians would not be sorry if their leaders were deported.
('6', 463, 2, 4, 900134) But I ought to point out to such opponents that there is no law authorizing the Government forcibly to deport anyone.
('6', 463, 2, 5, 900252) If that is to be done, another law will have to be passed.
('6', 463, 2, 6, 900311) Then the Transvaal Government will be able to deport those Indians who are ready to serve their country and even the government.
('6', 463, 2, 7, 900440) You say that, if the leaders are deported, the remaining Indians will obey the Act.
('6', 463, 2, 8, 900524) They will then realize how the Act protects them and how they had been misled about it.
('6', 463, 2, 9, 900612) It is readily seen that, in saying this, you cannot appreciate the feelings of Indians.
('6', 463, 2, 10, 900700) You are mistaken if you think that there is a single Indian who takes the Act as being meant for his protection.
('6', 463, 2, 11, 900813) I have repeatedly gone through the Act without coming across any section which might protect Indians.
('6', 463, 2, 12, 900915) Moreover, there can be no question of misleading any Indians in this regard for what has been placed before them is a very simple matter: the new Act only insults Indians by branding them as slaves.
('6', 463, 2, 13, 901114) In several ways the Act reduces Indians to the position of slaves since it is an attack on them as a community.
('6', 463, 3, 14, 901226) They have therefore been advised not to forego in any circumstances the existing rights by submitting to the new Act.
('6', 463, 3, 15, 901344) If the new Act comes into force, I believe that the Indian community will be reduced to that position.
('6', 463, 4, 16, 901447) To ward off this deadly blow, I have advised people to do three things as under:
('6', 463, 5, 17, 901528) (1) They should not take out new registers.
('6', 463, 6, 18, 901572) (2) As the Indians residing in the Transvaal have no right to vote, the resolution about going to gaol is the only means they have to oppose any particular law.
('6', 463, 6, 19, 901733) They should not take out a permit, nor leave the country, nor pay a fine; the only straightforward and effective course for them is to go to gaol.
('6', 463, 7, 20, 901880) (3) If they do this, they should have nothing to do with the Permit Office, and should also write to their friends to persuade them not to ask for new permits, whether temporary or permanent.

('6', 464, 1, 2, 902153) If anyone should say that, by doing so, they would be doing just what the whites wanted, let the whites think so.
('6', 464, 1, 3, 902267) This will prove what I have always said, viz., that the Indian community is not out to save its trade in the Transvaal, but to stay here with honour.
('6', 464, 1, 4, 902417) The Indian community will not sacrifice its good name just for the sake of a living.
('6', 464, 1, 5, 902502) Many English friends have told meand I myself believe that that not all Indians will perhaps accept this advice.
('6', 464, 1, 6, 902615) Even so, I have no fear.
('6', 464, 1, 7, 902640) I can only say that in that case we deserve the Act.
('6', 464, 1, 8, 902693) It is certain that we are now being put to the test.
('6', 464, 1, 9, 902746) It remains to be seen whether we stand it well or not.
('6', 464, 1, 10, 902801) I assert that no one can have anything to say against the position as set out above.
('6', 464, 1, 11, 902886) Instead of looking down upon it, the brave colonists should admire our stand.
('6', 464, 1, 12, 902964) But I think it to be a degrading and sinful thing to turn away from the path that we have chosen with true sincerity without caring whether others admire or condemn.

('6', 465, 1, 3, 904313) Mr. Gandhi told the meeting of the help received from Durban and answered many questions.
('6', 465, 1, 4, 904403) He then added: The present time is so critical that every Indian, without depending on what others do and irrespective of it, must Act upon the resolution on gaol going for the sake of his honour and for the sake of his country.
('6', 465, 1, 5, 904632) In both Durban and Pretoria, no one should have anything to do with the Permit Office.
('6', 465, 1, 6, 904719) No one should enter [the Colony] with a new permit.
('6', 465, 1, 7, 904771) Mr. Coovadia made a powerful speech and moved the following resolution: The Honorary Secretary should write to people everywhere, asking them to stop having any dealings with the Permit Office Telegrams should be sent to Bombay and other places to say that those intending to go to the Transvaal should give up their plans for the time being.
('6', 465, 1, 8, 905114) No one should give all the ten finger impressions.
('6', 465, 1, 9, 905165) Meetings should be held at all the places and people should be asked to refuse to submit to the new Ordinance.
('6', 465, 1, 10, 905276) The resolution was supported by Mr. Aswat and passed unanimously.
('6', 465, 1, 11, 905342) Concluding the deliberations, Mr. Essop Mian said: No one should be afraid of acting upon the resolution on gaolgoing.
('6', 465, 1, 12, 905461) Going to gaol is for us like receiving an honour.
('6', 465, 1, 13, 905511) We should not become dupes of our temptation that, if we submit to the new Ordinance, we shall get a few rights in return.
('6', 465, 1, 14, 905634) Lord Milner and other officials made many promises, none of which was kept.

('6', 466, 1, 3, 906129) Early death with fame is gain, And this the noble soul doth love.

('6', 466, 1, 5, 906267) Wealth may return that once has gone; Forever gone are honour and name.
('6', 466, 1, 6, 906339) The loss of honour brings in its train Miseries untold and threefold pain.
('6', 466, 2, 7, 906414) Letters received by us prove that today the Indian community in the Transvaal can think of nothing to talk about but the new Act.
('6', 466, 2, 8, 906544) This is a matter for rejoicing.
('6', 466, 2, 9, 906576) True to this spirit, we too will continue our discussion of the subject.
('6', 466, 2, 10, 906649) Last week we quoted a poem by the great heroic poet 1 of Gujarat.
('6', 466, 2, 11, 906715) Another poem by him charged with the heroic spirit is printed above.
('6', 466, 2, 12, 906784) The poet has shown vividly how it is a disgraceful thing to suffer taunts.
('6', 466, 2, 13, 906859) Honour once lost cannot be recovered, as wealth or other things, if lost, can be.
('6', 466, 2, 14, 906941) Moreover, the poet asserts that the loss of honour results in threefold sufferingof mind, of body, and poverty.
('6', 466, 2, 15, 907053) His Majesty Amir Habibullah has set an example of how respect can be won and maintained.
('6', 466, 2, 16, 907142) His Majesty visited Lady Mintos fair, where he bought a few things.

('6', 466, 2, 18, 907276) In making the bill, she wrote His Highness the Amir against the buyers name The Amir returned it to the lady, saying that there was a mistake in it.
('6', 466, 2, 19, 907425) The poor lady wondered what it could be.
('6', 466, 2, 20, 907466) She checked up the total and politely said that there was no mistake.
('6', 466, 2, 21, 907536) The Amir shook his head and handed back the bill.
('6', 466, 2, 22, 907586) Nervously, she went over the bill again and, finding nothing wrong, requested him to point out the mistake.
('6', 466, 2, 23, 907694) The Amir informed her through his attendants, The Amir is now not just His Highness, but His Majesty. This incident has an important lesson.

('6', 467, 1, 2, 907957) had become conscious of his dignity and we can say that from that day the Afghan people came into light.
('6', 467, 1, 3, 908062) To be sure, even in maintaining ones honour, one has to be careful.
('6', 467, 1, 4, 908130) If a conceited upstart should seek undeserved honour, we would ignore him as an impertinent person.
('6', 467, 1, 5, 908230) His Majesty seized the right occasion.
('6', 467, 1, 6, 908269) It was at a function like Lady Mintos fair that he reminded the lady of his title.
('6', 467, 1, 7, 908352) Thus all the world knew about it.
('6', 467, 1, 8, 908386) The lady had styled him His Highness out of ignorance but now no person or nation can show disrespect to him, intentionally or unintentionally.
('6', 467, 1, 9, 908530) Similarly, the Indian community in the Transvaal is now faced with the question of its dignity.
('6', 467, 1, 10, 908626) If it shows courage now, all it has suffered till today will be put down to its good sense.
('6', 467, 1, 11, 908718) If it submits to the Act this time, it will no longer be taken as good manners, but as baseness and cowardice.
('6', 467, 1, 12, 908829) For every nation, as for every individual, there are occasions when honour has to be fought for.
('6', 467, 1, 13, 908926) The Transvaal Indians are now faced with such a situation.
('6', 467, 1, 14, 908985) The whites were caught unawares but now wonder whether Indians have enough courage to face imprisonment.
('6', 467, 1, 15, 909090) It is our repeated appeal to the Indian community that all the thirteen thousand Indians should with one voice proclaim the answer, Yes, yes and yes. Cowards die many times, the valiant only once A cable from India says that, within six weeks, the plague took a toll of 4,51,892 lives.
('6', 467, 1, 16, 909376) Instead of dying in such agony, what would it matter if an equal number had to die for the sake of their country?
('6', 467, 1, 17, 909490) Is there anything that India could not achieve if Indians came forward in such large numbers to die for theircountry?
('6', 467, 1, 18, 909608) But in the Transvaal, we are not faced with a comparable situation.
('6', 467, 1, 19, 909676) All that needs to be done is to have courage to go to gaol and suffer a minor hardship.
('6', 467, 1, 20, 909764) Is there any Indian who will shrink from this?

('6', 467, 5, 24, 909893) Indians in Estcourt had claimed the right to vote at municipal elections, and the claim has been rejected by the Magistrate on the ground that, under the new [Natal] Municipal ACT, an Indian who does not enjoy the right to vote at political elections cannot have the municipal franchise either, that is, the rights of citizenship.
('6', 468, 0, 1, 910224) VOL. 6: 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 469
('6', 468, 1, 2, 910267) judgement is altogether wrong.
('6', 468, 1, 3, 910298) The Municipal Act has not yet been passed, and our fight against it is still going on.
('6', 468, 1, 4, 910385) It is obvious that the Magistrate at Estcourt does not read this journal, although he gets it free.
('6', 468, 1, 5, 910485) Otherwise he would not have given such a wrong judgement under an act which has not yet received the approval of the Imperial Government.
('6', 468, 1, 6, 910623) It is now essential that Estcourt Indians make an appeal.
('6', 468, 1, 7, 910681) Having considered the matter carefully, we want to say that Estcourt Indians ought not to have taken this step without the approval of the Natal Indian Congress.
('6', 468, 1, 8, 910843) This is not the time when any one section of the Indian community can act independently of the others.
('6', 468, 1, 9, 910946) There are many grievances [Indians have] in Natal.
('6', 468, 1, 10, 910997) It is imperative to put up a fight.
('6', 468, 1, 11, 911033) If in the course of this struggle, a mistake is made even in one town, it may prove detrimental to the interests of the whole community.
('6', 468, 1, 12, 911170) We believe that there was no need of such precipitate action in the matter of the municipal franchise.
('6', 468, 1, 13, 911273) Efforts are being made to have the Billnow being discussed in Britaindisallowed.
('6', 468, 1, 14, 911354) The Estcourt case is likely to have an adverse effect [on our efforts].
('6', 468, 1, 15, 911426) We are now in a dilemma.
('6', 468, 1, 16, 911451) If the case is dropped, we shall be disgraced; if on the other hand we go on with it and the final judgement is adverse, the act may receive [Imperial] assent.
('6', 468, 1, 17, 911611) What difference does it make whether a few Indians get the vote or not?
('6', 468, 1, 18, 911683) The right [to municipal franchise] must not be lost, because the loss of that right will degrade us.
('6', 468, 1, 19, 911784) On the other hand, there is no indignity in desisting from the exercise of a right which we have.
('6', 468, 1, 20, 911882) We hope that the Indian community, at all places in Natal, will profit from this incident and not take any steps without consulting the Congress.
('6', 468, 1, 21, 912028) At the same time, we repeat that the appeal in the Estcourt case should be proceeded with.
('6', 468, 1, 22, 912119) Natal Indians should remember that, if they wish to assert their claim to the municipal franchise, they should pay up the rates before the month is out.

('6', 469, 0, 1, 912527) 470 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 469, 1, 2, 912569) That means that the Colonies in South Africa have complete powers to regulate Asiatic immigration.
('6', 469, 1, 3, 912668) All that will remain for the Imperial Government to do is occasionally to take a look at laws relating to Indians now residing in South Africa.
('6', 469, 1, 4, 912812) But the new Transvaal Ordinance does not relate to immigration.
('6', 469, 1, 5, 912876) And though it applies to the Indians already living there, the Imperial Government has given its assent to it.
('6', 469, 1, 6, 912987) It follows from this that the local governments in South Africa will be able to attack the Indian community with impunity.
('6', 469, 1, 7, 913110) The only weapon with which to ward off the attack is our resolution on gaol going.
('6', 469, 1, 8, 913193) As in the saying, there is no help like self help, no water like that of rain, everything depends on our own strength and courage.
('6', 469, 1, 9, 913324) Even by the road that we have taken we shall in the end arrive at the resolution on gaol going; so far sighted is the resolution and so obvious are its advantages.

('6', 469, 5, 13, 913555) NEW ACT Last week I replied to a number of questions.
('6', 469, 5, 14, 913609) 1 But more questions are being received.
('6', 469, 5, 15, 913650) Most of these have been answered earlier.
('6', 469, 5, 16, 913692) However, let me here answer them again, and I may be excused any repetition by those who have clearly followed earlier replies.
('6', 469, 5, 17, 913820) The reader is requested to keep the previous number handy for reference.
('6', 469, 6, 18, 913893) WHAT DOES FREE DEFENCE BY GANDHI MEAN?
('6', 469, 7, 19, 913932) There have been many inquiries in this regard.
('6', 469, 7, 20, 913979) Let me clarify the matter further.
('6', 469, 7, 21, 914014) If anyone is prosecuted under the new Act, and if t he person concerned holds a valid permit or is otherwise entitled to reside in the Transvaal, Mr. Gandhi will defend him in the court free of charge.
('6', 469, 7, 22, 914216) If the case is to be heard outside Johannesburg, the Association will pay Mr. Gandhis railway fare; but if the place he is required to visit has made no contribution to the British Indian Association [funds] already, the Association will collect the dues.

('6', 470, 1, 2, 914554) defence will be in respect of the permit and the Governments refusal to issue a licence 1 when a new permit has not been taken out.
('6', 470, 1, 3, 914686) That is, if a person does not hold a licence and is therefore arrested, he will not be defended free of charge.
('6', 470, 1, 4, 914798) But a person who has been refused a licence for having failed to take out a new permit will be defended free of charge.
('6', 470, 1, 5, 914918) The result of it will be that the person will ultimately have to go to gaol.
('6', 470, 1, 6, 914995) Mr. Gandhi will not, with or without fees, defend those who do not desire a gaol sentence.
('6', 470, 1, 7, 915086) A reference to the last number of Indian Opinion 2 will show in what manner the defence will be put forward.
('6', 470, 1, 8, 915195) We recently heard that permits were being examined.
('6', 470, 1, 9, 915247) If this is true, it is not being done under the new Act.
('6', 470, 1, 10, 915304) If therefore anyone is arrested following such examination, he will not be defended free of charge.
('6', 470, 1, 11, 915404) It has to be remembered that the case should fall under the new Act.
('6', 470, 2, 12, 915473) WHAT SHOULD BE DONE BY PERSONS GOING
('6', 470, 3, 13, 915510) TO DELAGOA BAY?
('6', 470, 4, 14, 915526) An Indian going to Delagoa Bay is required to obtain a pass from the Portuguese Consul and has often to visit even the Permit Office.
('6', 470, 4, 15, 915660) The question has arisen whether such a person should seek the aid of the Permit Office.
('6', 470, 4, 16, 915748) It is obvious that, even in this case, no one should do so.
('6', 470, 4, 17, 915808) But no one can prevent a person from travelling to DeIagoa Bay.
('6', 470, 4, 18, 915872) If at all the Portuguese Government should do so, he can always go via Durban, but he should not approach the Permit Office.
('6', 470, 4, 19, 915997) However, the matter is being enquired into and I shall give more information later.
('6', 470, 4, 20, 916081) Going to the Permit Office, however, is out of the question whatever happens.
('6', 470, 5, 21, 916159) WHAT SHOULD BE DONE BY PERSONS RETURNING
('6', 470, 6, 22, 916200) FROM DELAGOA BAY?
('6', 470, 7, 23, 916218) It is reported that, at Delagoa Bay, an Indian has to produce a pass from the British Consul before a railway ticket can be sold to him.
('6', 470, 7, 24, 916355) I believe that this practice is illegal.
('6', 470, 7, 25, 916396) The remedy lies in the hands of the Delagoa Bay Indians themselves.
('6', 470, 7, 26, 916464) But what applies to Durban applies to Delagoa Bay also.
('6', 470, 7, 27, 916520) That is to say, no one is at present to take
('6', 470, 8, 28, 916565) 1 The trader would naturally need to have a permit before his licence could be renewed.

('6', 471, 1, 2, 916734) out new permits.
('6', 471, 1, 3, 916751) Holders of old permits may come in only if they are prepared to go to gaol.
('6', 471, 1, 4, 916827) Otherwise the best course will be not to enter the Transvaal for the present.
('6', 471, 2, 5, 916905) CAN ONE LEAVE THE TRANSVAAL?
('6', 471, 3, 6, 916934) A correspondent has asked whether an Indian who now leaves the Transvaal can return later, say, in June.
('6', 471, 3, 7, 917039) According to the new Act, an Indian will, in this situation, have to take out a new permit.
('6', 471, 3, 8, 917131) If he does not, he will have to go to gaol.
('6', 471, 3, 9, 917175) Those, therefore, who have overcome the fear of imprisonment can boldly return.
('6', 471, 3, 10, 917255) Those who are afraid had better stay out.
('6', 471, 3, 11, 917297) If you are brave, you may come and go without fear.
('6', 471, 3, 12, 917349) WHEN ARE SHOPS TO BE CLOSED FOR THE DAY?
('6', 471, 3, 13, 917390) This question does not arise out of the Act.
('6', 471, 3, 14, 917435) A letter from Machadodorp says that the police in the town require the Indian traders to close their shops early.
('6', 471, 3, 15, 917549) If the police are doing this, it is illegal.
('6', 471, 3, 16, 917594) But my advice to all Indian traders is that they should everywhere close their shops at the same time as the whites.
('6', 471, 3, 17, 917711) We need not wait for legal compulsion.
('6', 471, 3, 18, 917750) There is no doubt though that the necessary law will be passed in a few months.
('6', 471, 3, 19, 917830) Municipalities have already been empowered to frame such bye laws.
('6', 471, 3, 20, 917897) Grace lies in doing a thing before we are forced to do it.
('6', 471, 4, 21, 917956) WHAT SHOULD BE DONE ABOUT TEMPORARY PERMITS?
('6', 471, 5, 22, 918001) This question and a few others arising from it have been raised by a correspondent.
('6', 471, 5, 23, 918085) I know that some temporary permits expire at the end of June.
('6', 471, 5, 24, 918147) My advice is that the holders of temporary permits should leave the Transvaal before the expiry of the permit period.
('6', 471, 5, 25, 918265) To the very end, it is essential to show that our struggle rests on truth alone.
('6', 471, 5, 26, 918346) Those who are in the Transvaal by right ought to defend their honour stubbornly.
('6', 471, 5, 27, 918427) I can think only of two exceptions in relation to this replythe Imam of a mosque and the Hindu Shastri.
('6', 471, 5, 28, 918531) These two have come in for imparting religious instruction.
('6', 471, 5, 29, 918591) Had the new Act not come into force, they would have had no difficulty in getting permits for a further period.
('6', 471, 5, 30, 918703) Now they cannot take out new permits, but they can prolong their stay after duly informing the Governmentbut only with the intention of going to gaol.
('6', 471, 5, 31, 918854) They can argue that they neither carry on a trade nor have they a share in anyones income and that their sole function is to impart religious instruction to their people.
('6', 471, 5, 32, 919025) They cannot, therefore, leave.
('6', 471, 5, 33, 919056) This argument does not,

('6', 472, 1, 2, 919123) however, apply to private persons who are here for business reasons.
('6', 472, 1, 3, 919192) They may well be prepared to prove their courage by going to gaol, but I have to tell them respectfully that they may not enjoy the privilege of imprisonment.
('6', 472, 1, 4, 919351) Holders of temporary permits do not have the rights of refugees.
('6', 472, 1, 5, 919416) They had come here for a temporary period and, at the end of it, are bound honestly to leave.
('6', 472, 1, 6, 919510) If such temporary permit holders desire to serve the country, they can remain outside the Transvaal, dedicate themselves to the service of the country, and go about telling other Indians of the miseries of the Transvaal Indians.
('6', 472, 1, 7, 919739) They can thus render much service to the community as and when the occasion arises.
('6', 472, 1, 8, 919823) He who wants to be of use will always have the opportunity, wherever he may be at the moment and in whatever condition.
('6', 472, 2, 9, 919943) AND OF OTHERS WHO ENTERED WITHOUT PERMITS AND OBTAINED THEM LATER Some Indians entered without permits when in the beginning they were free to do so.
('6', 472, 2, 10, 920093) Later, such persons were granted Resident passes, in exchange for which they eventually obtained permits.
('6', 472, 2, 11, 920199) A correspondent inquires about the validity of these permits.
('6', 472, 2, 12, 920261) The reply is that all such permits are valid.
('6', 472, 2, 13, 920307) He also wants to know what orders will be passed in such cases.
('6', 472, 2, 14, 920371) This question results from ignorance How can anyone order those who are determined to have nothing to do with the Permit Office?
('6', 472, 2, 15, 920500) They are free and they will go to gaol to defend their freedom.
('6', 472, 3, 16, 920564) GO TO GAOL I have received some letters containing exhortations to Indians to go to gaol.
('6', 472, 3, 17, 920654) I am not sending these for publication.
('6', 472, 3, 18, 920694) Today we need men who are themselves prepared to go to gaol.
('6', 472, 3, 19, 920755) If they go to gaol themselves, there will be no need to advise others to do so; if one is not prepared to go to gaol, ones advice can have no effect on others.
('6', 472, 3, 20, 920915) To those who have made this appeal my plea is that they should write and tell us what they propose to do themselves, so that their names can be published in the English and Gujarati sections of this journal.
('6', 472, 4, 21, 921123) WARNING TO HAWKERS Regulations have been framed for hawkers all over the Transvaal, of which the following is a summary: A person carrying his goods in a wagon will be treated as a hawker, one who goes about on foot will be regarded as a
('6', 473, 0, 1, 921361) 474 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 473, 1, 2, 921403) pedlar.
('6', 473, 1, 3, 921411) The pedlar may have a wheelbarrow.
('6', 473, 1, 4, 921446) The licence fee for a hawker is 5 10s and for a pedlar 5. In his application, every hawker should state his residential address and inform the authorities of any subsequent change in it.
('6', 473, 1, 5, 921633) On his barrow or on his pack, the hawker or the pedlar, as the case may be, should display the words Licensed Hawker for Johannesburg Municipal Area.
('6', 473, 1, 6, 921783) Likewise, the room where the hawkers or pedlars wares are stored should also display his name and the words [of the notice] If he issues any hand bills, these too should bear these particulars No person can make over his licence to another, except when a servant who has been employed for hawking wares is relieved and another person engaged in his stead, the original license may, with the permission of the municipality, be made over to the new servant.
('6', 473, 1, 7, 922239) A hawker may not stay at the same place for more than 20 minutes for purposes of his business, and he may not visit the same place more than once in the course of a day.
('6', 473, 1, 8, 922409) Hawking is prohibited on mining ground.
('6', 473, 1, 9, 922449) A hawker cannot take his wares out of his barrow for display as in a shop.
('6', 473, 1, 10, 922524) Garden produce can be sold by the grower or his servant without a licence, and in such a case the said regulations do not apply.
('6', 473, 2, 11, 922653) Regulations to this effect have been framed for the Johannes burg municipal area, and they will probably receive the Governors sanction in a week or two.
('6', 473, 2, 12, 922807) These regulations mean that no person with a hawking licence can stay at the same place.
('6', 473, 2, 13, 922896) The President Street Market will henceforth be closed [to hawkers], that is, persons doing business there will need to have a shopkeepers licence.
('6', 473, 2, 14, 923043) The regulations are of course harsh, but as they apply equally to whites and non whites, nothing can be done about them.
('6', 473, 2, 15, 923164) Similar regulations have been framed by the Krugersdorp municipality also.
('6', 473, 2, 16, 923239) In effect, the municipality frankly says that, since most of the licence holders are Indians, there is no harm in making the regulations astringent as possible.
('6', 473, 3, 17, 923400) TRAMWAY REGULATIONS
('6', 473, 4, 18, 923420) At last, the tramway matter has been decided.
('6', 473, 4, 19, 923466) The regulations which were opposed by the British Indian Association have now been passed and published in the Gazette.
('6', 473, 4, 20, 923586) There are some good points about them.
('6', 473, 4, 21, 923625) For example, the phrase Coloured person does not
('6', 474, 0, 1, 923674) VOL. 6: 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 475
('6', 474, 1, 2, 923717) include an Asiatic.
('6', 474, 1, 3, 923737) The regulations cover other points besides, some of which are dealt with below: The Town Council has the right to reserve any tram car or any part of it for Europeans or Asiatics or Coloured persons.
('6', 474, 1, 4, 923937) The Council has the authority to grant special permission to any person to travel by any tram car.
('6', 474, 1, 5, 924036) The servants accompanying white children can travel by all tram cars.
('6', 474, 1, 6, 924106) A servant is allowed to travel with his master by any tram car that the master is authorized to use.
('6', 474, 1, 7, 924207) The Council is bound to provide reasonable facilities for travellers of all classes.
('6', 474, 1, 8, 924292) Two points in these regulations deserve to be noted.
('6', 474, 1, 9, 924345) One is that the servants of whites, however dark, can travel by the same car as their masters.
('6', 474, 1, 10, 924440) The other is that, according to Section 20, dogs can be carried in the car meant for the whites, provide the conductor does not object.
('6', 474, 1, 11, 924576) In other words, unlike dogs and black servants, a free Indian will not be free to travel by a tram car of his choice unless a special permit has been obtained by him for that purpose.
('6', 474, 1, 12, 924760) In reply to this, one may point out that the whites cannot travel in cars meant for the blacks either.
('6', 474, 1, 13, 924863) The only difference, however is that, while the whites are ranked with the Queen Mother, Coloured persons and Indians are treated like the youngest housewife in the village.
('6', 474, 1, 14, 925037) My advice is that, under such humiliating conditions, no one should ask for a permit.
('6', 474, 1, 15, 925123) It all depends on us whether or not we continue to be treated as the youngest housewife in the village.
('6', 474, 2, 16, 925227) LOCATIONS From the current issue of the Gazette, I find that the Locations at Christiana, Heidelberg, Potgietersrust, Rustenburg and Volkstroom have been made over to their respective municipalities.
('6', 474, 2, 17, 925427) Locations at Roossenekal, Leysdorp, Amersfoort and other places have been closed down.
('6', 474, 3, 18, 925514) WASHERMEN AT NEW CLARE The editor of this journal has sent to The Sunday Times a reply to its attack on the New Clare washermen.
('6', 474, 3, 19, 925643) 1 The reply shows that the accusations made in The Sunday Times by Mr. Volture were all false.
('6', 474, 3, 20, 925738) The editor claims that the water flowing from the spring is not dirty.
('6', 474, 3, 21, 925809) The water used for washing is changed twice a day.
('6', 474, 3, 22, 925860) Indian washermen do not get their work done on a contract basis.

('6', 475, 1, 3, 926087) Indian washermen hold certificates of efficiency from well known Europeans.
('6', 475, 1, 4, 926163) The editor has accordingly asked for an apology from the correspondent who wrote in The Sunday Times.
('6', 475, 1, 5, 926265) In reply to this, the editor of The Sunday Times writes that the arguments of the editor of Indian Opinion are weighty and convincing.
('6', 475, 1, 6, 926400) He wishes to publish a reply, but that Mr. Volture is ill and his reply may take a week or two.
('6', 475, 1, 7, 926496) This shows that, for the present at any rate, The Sunday Times has suffered a defeat.
('6', 475, 1, 8, 926582) For the information of those who may not know it, I should say that Mr. Volture is a pseud onym.
('6', 475, 1, 9, 926679) It means vulture, the bird of prey.
('6', 475, 1, 10, 926715) This human vulture had meant to eat up the Indian washermen, but it will not be wrong to say that for the present they have been rescued from its clutches by the editor of Indian Opinion.
('6', 475, 2, 11, 926903) BRAVE RITCH A cable has been published in the newspapers here to say that Mr. Ritch has addressed a letter to the well known paper, The Times.
('6', 475, 2, 12, 927046) Therein he has smashed Mr: Curtiss argument 1. He has put forward a strong argument in defence of the Indian community and shown how Mr. Chamneys Report is really in our favour.
('6', 475, 2, 13, 927224) Mr. Ritch has been doing invaluable work.
('6', 475, 2, 14, 927266) Day and night his mind is engaged in the same thought.
('6', 475, 2, 15, 927321) He misses no opportunity of pleading our cause.
('6', 475, 2, 16, 927369) Well educated Indians should follow his example.
('6', 475, 2, 17, 927418) It might be said that no one else would do as much work even if we paid him four times as much as Mr. Ritch receives from the Committee.

('6', 476, 3, 4, 927775) ...On Sunday last, at the hall of the Transvaal Chinese Association, a large and representative meeting was held to consider the next step to be taken with regard to the new anti Asiatic law.
('6', 476, 3, 5, 927967) Mr. Quinn, Chairman of the Cantonese Club, presided, and the meeting was addressed by Mr. M. K. Gandhi, who had been specially invited to set forth the position.
('6', 476, 3, 6, 928129) This he did, briefly and succinctly, pointing out that...the new law did not add to the security of those Asiatics [who were] rightly in the Transvaal, as had been so often alleged by the anti Asiatic party and echoed by the uninformed general public, but really took away all their existing personal liberty, guaranteed under solemn Imperial pledges, substituting a restricted liberty, which no self respecting subject of a civilized country could possibly accept...the only dignified defence of their rights that the Asiatics in the Transvaal could make was to ignore the compulsory clauses entailing re registration, and submit themselves to the extreme penalty of the law, namely, liability to imprisonment; as also to boycott the Permit Office....

('6', 476, 7, 10, 928996) SIR, The arrival of General Botha and the fact that the Asiatic Registration Act, though it has received the Royal sanction, is still the subject matter of correspondence between the Imperial Government
('6', 476, 8, 11, 929199) 1 This is extracted from Johannesburg Jottings, which H. S. L. Polak, Our Johannesburg Correspondent, contributed as a regular feature for Indian Opinion.
('6', 476, 8, 12, 929354) 2 The Chinese had pledged their support to the Fourth Resolution of the Indian mass meeting of September, 1906 and to the Second Resolution of the mass meeting of April, 1907 and also announced their intention of going to gaol if the Transvaal Asiatic Registration Act was enforced.
('6', 476, 8, 13, 929637) Vide Johannesburg Letter, 27 4 1907.
('6', 477, 0, 1, 929674) 478 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 477, 1, 2, 929716) and the local Government, encourage me to appeal once more to your good sense and, through you, to that of the colonists.
('6', 477, 1, 3, 929838) Now that the anti Asiatic party has obtained what it wanted, is it impossible to arrive at a reasonable compromise and to save British Indians from being considered untrustworthy and feloniously inclined?
('6', 477, 1, 4, 930043) the Act is not yet gazetted, and it need not be until the Government wishes to do so.
('6', 477, 1, 5, 930129) I, therefore, suggest that, before it is gazetted, a form for new permits may be mutually agreed upon, and, in accordance with it, Indians and other Asiatics may be registered afresh in exchange for proper documents they may possess.
('6', 477, 1, 6, 930363) If, then, all Asiatics thus voluntarily surrender their documents, there can be no occasion for submitting them to the degradation contemplated by the Act.
('6', 477, 1, 7, 930519) If, however, there are Asiatics in the Colony who do not surrender their documents, the Act can be immediately gazetted, and be made applicable, by a short Bill, to them.
('6', 477, 1, 8, 930690) Thus, those who are bona fide holders of permits and are honest will be automatically separated from those who are guilty.
('6', 477, 1, 9, 930813) I do not know whether you can see any flaw in this proposal, unless you think that the object of the legislation is not that illicit traffic in permits may be stopped, but that it is to, openly and boldly, put an unwarranted affront upon British Indians and other Asiatics.
('6', 477, 1, 10, 931087) Let me remind you, before any such declaration is made, of Lord Ampthill's remarks:
('6', 477, 2, 11, 931171) This is not a matter which only touches our honour.
('6', 477, 2, 12, 931223) We are pledged to our fellow citizens in Indiapledged by the solemn declaration of the Sovereign, by the pronouncements of our statesmen, and by all that is implied in the whole method of our administration of that great dominionto treat the people of India as fellow citizens in every sense of the word.
('6', 477, 2, 13, 931528) We invite them to be proud of their citizenship of the Empire.
('6', 477, 2, 14, 931591) We tell them, again and again, that there is nothing to prevent their rising to the same positions as are held by Englishmen in India, and we imply, in all that we do for them and say to them, that, whenever they are under the British flag in any part of the world, they will be treated as British citizens.
('6', 477, 2, 15, 931899) Lord Lansdowne feels so keenly the humiliation in which British statesmen are placed by this Act that he questions whether to wound the susceptibilities of the whole Indian nation is not more injurious and imprudent than to allow the surreptitious entry of a few Indians into the country.
('6', 477, 2, 16, 932188) But the proposal I have ventured to sketch above is just as effective against surreptitious: entry as may be by [sic] the Asiatic Act.

('6', 478, 1, 2, 932416) 397. JURIES ON TRIAL
('6', 478, 2, 3, 932437) Ever since the birth of this journal, it has studiously restricted itself to questions affecting Indians in South Africa.
('6', 478, 2, 4, 932559) We consider that, however desirable other questions may be from a journalistic stand point, we must recognize our own limitations and not enter into questions of high policy, or questions that do not directly affect Indians in this country.
('6', 478, 2, 5, 932800) But there are exceptions to every rule.
('6', 478, 2, 6, 932840) We feel we should be false to our profession, if we did not deal with the now celebrated Mtonga case 1, which has attracted so much attention.
('6', 478, 2, 7, 932983) It rises from the platform of Native policy to that of humanity and, to a certain extent, the principle underlying it is applicable to Indians also.
('6', 478, 2, 8, 933132) We, therefore, gladly make room for an extract from the extremely well reasoned and humane leading article from the columns of The Natal Mercury.
('6', 478, 2, 9, 933278) It constitutes an indictment of the jury system in particular when applicable to trials between whites and blacks.
('6', 478, 2, 10, 933393) We join with our contemporary in its repudiation of the charge of the special ill treatment of Natives levelled against Natal in some quarters and based on the abortion of justice in the Mtonga case.
('6', 478, 2, 11, 933593) We believe that what happened in Natal is likely to happen, under similar circumsta nces, in any part of South Africa, or in any country conditioned as South Africa is.
('6', 478, 2, 12, 933762) Natal, no more than any other country, can claim a monopoly of jurymen fired with passion and prejudice, but the fact that instances like the Mtonga case happen in South Africa must waken the public conscience, and make those who are jealous of the reputation of South Africa seriously consider whether the time has not arrived to revise our ideas about the jury system.
('6', 478, 2, 13, 934133) In a place like South Africa, where there is no leisured class and where people of all nationalities congregate, the jury system is about the worst that could be devised in connection with the administration of justice.
('6', 478, 2, 14, 934353) The inherent condition of success of trial by jury is that the accused is tried by his equals.
('6', 478, 2, 15, 934448) It is an insult to mans intelligence to contend that
('6', 478, 3, 16, 934501) 1 Mtonga, an African, was assaulted by certain persons on suspicion of having committed an offence.
('6', 478, 3, 17, 934601) Tried later, he was fount guilty by the jury; but the Governor, convinced of his innocence, reprieved him.
('6', 479, 0, 1, 934708) 480 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 479, 1, 2, 934750) there is any such trial in South Africa, when the question is as between whites and blacks.
('6', 479, 1, 3, 934842) When passions are roused, men who are not trained to examine facts and apply a well balanced mind to the matters before them cannot possibly arrive at a just conclusion.
('6', 479, 1, 4, 935012) Even in a well settled and old place like Liverpool, possessing a homogeneous population with traditions to go by, it required a judge of the calibre of the late Justice Stephen to secure a verdict at the trial of Mrs. Haybrick.
('6', 479, 1, 5, 935241) How is it possible, then, to get any satisfaction out of jurymen in a place like South Africa, where different nationalities are still in the melting pot, and a South African nation has yet to rise in the dim and distant future?
('6', 479, 1, 6, 935470) We are no worshippers of the idol of equality, when there is no foundation for it.
('6', 479, 1, 7, 935553) It is possible that any attempt to abolish the jury system, in cases where there are whites and blacks concerned, will be met by the cry of false equality.
('6', 479, 1, 8, 935709) We hold that any Native or Coloured man who takes up a position of that description does not know real equality.
('6', 479, 1, 9, 935822) All that can reasonably be claimed, today, by or for them is equality in the eye of the law.
('6', 479, 1, 10, 935915) White people from different parts of Europe, who come to South Africa with no notion of Imperialism, cannot be expected either to think of Imperial obligations or other notions of justice and equal rights as between themselves and others whom they hold to be inferior, save from the dictates of whatever humanity there may be in them.
('6', 479, 2, 11, 936250) We hope, therefore, that no Coloured man or Asiatic, because our argument applies equally to Asiatics as to other Coloured people, will think of opposing the movement that the Natal Press has, from purely disinterested and just motives, inaugurated for the abolition of trial by jury in cases where there are European and Coloured people concerned.
('6', 479, 2, 12, 936599) It would, indeed, be the best thing if trial by jury were abolished altogether, but it is such a time honoured superstition that one can hardly expect public opinion to reject it altogether, nor will it be possible to make out a strong case against the institution so far as it may apply to whites only.
('6', 479, 2, 13, 936903) We believe that, if the matter is left where the Press has left it, no result will be achieved.
('6', 479, 2, 14, 936999) The churches in South Africa are rightly supposed to be the custodians of the interests, we will not call them the rights, of the Natives in South Africa, and, though the immediate question has arisen in Natal, we feel that there should be among the

('6', 480, 1, 2, 937292) churches a simultaneous movement and a petition to the respective South African Governments for the complete abolition of trial by jury in cases as between white and Coloured men.
('6', 480, 1, 3, 937472) We think, also, that such a movement on the part of the churches should be very widely supported by the Natives and the Coloured communities of South Africa.

('6', 480, 4, 8, 937840) How can I break the loving bond of home?

('6', 480, 4, 10, 937971) As we pause and think, and think and pause, All too suddenly the enemy descends on us.
('6', 480, 4, 11, 938058) Overwhelmed with fear and trembling, To defend ourselves is a job.
('6', 480, 4, 12, 938125) Digging a well when the flames rage high This is but growing wise after the mischief is done, To try and put up a bund when the floods begin.

('6', 480, 4, 14, 938284) Take up arms, and march together, Spear in hand, roaring a challenge to the foe.
('6', 480, 5, 15, 938365) The new Transvaal law is still lowering and thundering.
('6', 480, 5, 16, 938421) As the proverb goes, a thunderstorm seldom means rain and barking dogs seldom bite.
('6', 480, 5, 17, 938505) But this new law will burst indeed, just as much as it thunders.
('6', 480, 5, 18, 938570) It will be gazetted as soon as General Botha 1 returns from England.
('6', 480, 5, 19, 938639) Let us, therefore, give further thought to the challenge that

('6', 481, 1, 2, 938818) we have offered to that law through the gaol resolution 1. We can see from the poem quoted at the top of this article that, when we are about to embark on an adventure; it is useless to go on thinking of the consequences.
('6', 481, 1, 3, 939040) Those rushing to a battle field do not think of what will happen to their family or business.
('6', 481, 1, 4, 939134) The Indian people have always placed their trust in God alone.
('6', 481, 1, 5, 939197) Before that God we took an oath and resolved not to submit to the new law.
('6', 481, 1, 6, 939272) The proper time to think was before the Resolution was passed, and, indeed, we did think then.
('6', 481, 1, 7, 939367) But now the time for thought is gone.
('6', 481, 1, 8, 939405) Now is the time to be firm in our resolve.
('6', 481, 1, 9, 939448) Sheikh Saadi 2 says in Gulistan that, if man were to think of the Giver of his daily bread quite as much as he does of his bread, his place in heaven would doubtless be higher even thanthat of the angels.In the same way, we have now to complete the task we have taken up, thinking not of our bread, our family and our business, but of Him who preserves all and is the cause of their progress.
('6', 481, 1, 10, 939841) Even if everyone forsakes us, so long as we go on doing our work, trusting the Master who lives in the hearts of us all, He will never forsake us.
('6', 481, 1, 11, 939988) Let us take the example of our rulers.
('6', 481, 1, 12, 940027) When the Boers crossed swords with the mighty British, the late Mr. Kruger 3 did not think of his family or wealth.
('6', 481, 1, 13, 940143) General Joubert fell fighting.
('6', 481, 1, 14, 940174) General Smuts 4, too, fought desperately.
('6', 481, 1, 15, 940216) Dr. Krause 5 suffered imprisonment for two years and all his property at Johannesburg was ruined.
('6', 481, 1, 16, 940314) Mr. De Villiers, who now heads the Department of Justice, was thrown into prison.
('6', 481, 1, 17, 940396) He received bullet wounds in his leg.
('6', 481, 1, 18, 940434) General Botha fought to the very last.
('6', 481, 1, 19, 940473) The Boer women too endured many hardships with quiet strength and gave courage to their sons and husbands.

('6', 482, 1, 12, 942101) We on our part have been hoping that the Indian community will not be afraid of doing even more.
('6', 482, 1, 13, 942198) Fear God alone; then there is no need to fear anyone elsethis is what all the scriptures teach us.

('6', 482, 3, 15, 942338) 399. A PRIZE OF 1
('6', 482, 4, 16, 942356) The title of this note is A Prize, but the reader is not to think mainly of the prize.
('6', 482, 4, 17, 942443) For Indians today it is the season of the new law and the gaol resolution.
('6', 482, 4, 18, 942518) Hence, any Indian who sends us the finest poem in Gujarati or Hindustani (Urdu or Hindi) composed by him in support of the gaol resolution will be awarded a prize as above.
('6', 482, 4, 19, 942691) We hope that no one who is used to writing poetry will fail to compete.
('6', 482, 4, 20, 942763) The poem should be sent not so much for the prize as for the honour.
('6', 482, 4, 21, 942832) The following are the conditions for the competition:
('6', 482, 5, 22, 942886) Tyler, Hampden and Bunyan, 20 10 1906. 1 (1792 1863), served in the Crimean War, 1853 6; took over as Commander in Chief of India in 1857.

('6', 483, 1, 2, 943457) (1) The poem should not exceed 20 lines.
('6', 483, 1, 3, 943498) (2) The words should be simple.
('6', 483, 1, 4, 943530) (3) Though there is no restriction on the raga 1, the metre lavani 2 is preferable as a medium for the heroic sentiment.
('6', 483, 1, 5, 943651) (4) The poem should be written in ink in a clear hand and on only one side of the sheet.
('6', 483, 1, 6, 943740) (5) The name and address of the writer should be given at the end of the poem.
('6', 483, 1, 7, 943819) (6) The poem should cite modern and ancient examples of bravery, Muslim as well as Hindu.
('6', 483, 1, 8, 943909) Others too may be included.
('6', 483, 1, 9, 943937) (7) The poem should contain the weighty reasons that have been advanced from time to time for adhering to the gaol resolution.
('6', 483, 1, 10, 944064) (8) The poem should reach Phoenix not later than the morning of June 12 or our Johannesburg office (Post Box No.
('6', 483, 1, 11, 944177) 6522) on June 14. The result will be announced in our issue dated the 22nd.
('6', 483, 1, 12, 944253) We hope that many will compete.

('6', 483, 3, 15, 944347) Many exciting things are happening in all parts of the world.
('6', 483, 3, 16, 944409) We hear people everywhere speaking of Our Country.
('6', 483, 3, 17, 944460) The people of Egypt proclaim, Egypt for Egyptians.
('6', 483, 3, 18, 944511) The Chinese have massacred many Europeans in Hong Kong.
('6', 483, 3, 19, 944567) The negroes declare, We should have our rights. Self government has been established in Iran.
('6', 483, 3, 20, 944661) Afghanistan has grown strong.
('6', 483, 3, 21, 944691) And now India.
('6', 483, 3, 22, 944706) There too we hear the thunderous cry of India for Indians.
('6', 483, 3, 23, 944765) Towards this end, efforts are in progress everywhere to bring together Hindus and Muslims.
('6', 483, 3, 24, 944856) In the Punjab, a Muslim has started a paper named Hindu Muslim, and he urges the two communities to become united.
('6', 483, 3, 25, 944971) From the other side, agitation is being carried on by papers like Bande Mataram for ending British rule.
('6', 483, 3, 26, 945076) The proceedings against the Punjabee led to

('6', 484, 1, 2, 945204) riotous demonstrations in which prominent Indians took part.
('6', 484, 1, 3, 945265) Some of them were arrested.
('6', 484, 1, 4, 945293) Some will be deported from the country, and some will be imprisoned.
('6', 484, 1, 5, 945362) Highly educated gentlemen like Lala Lajpat Rai 1 were among those involved.
('6', 484, 1, 6, 945438) The question should naturally arise as to what we should do at such a time.
('6', 484, 1, 7, 945514) Though we can do nothing, thoughtful men should consider what attitude they should adopt.
('6', 484, 1, 8, 945604) Should the British be thrown out of India?
('6', 484, 1, 9, 945647) Can it be done, even if we wish to do so?
('6', 484, 1, 10, 945689) To these two questions we can reply that we stand to lose by ending British rule and that, even if we wanted to, India is not in a position to end it.
('6', 484, 1, 11, 945840) By this we do not suggest that the British Raj is very powerful and that India has had incalculable advantages from it, or that India could not, if it so willed, remove British rule.
('6', 484, 1, 12, 946023) But we hold that, whatever the motives of the British in coming to India, we have much to learn from them.
('6', 484, 1, 13, 946130) They are a brave and considerate people, and are on the whole honest.
('6', 484, 1, 14, 946200) Blind where self interest is concerned, they give unstinted admiration for bravery wherever found.
('6', 484, 1, 15, 946299) They are a powerful nation, and India enjoys not a little protection under them.
('6', 484, 1, 16, 946380) It is not, therefore, desirable that British rule in India should disappear.
('6', 484, 1, 17, 946457) Should we then repudiate such men as Lala Lajpat Rai?
('6', 484, 1, 18, 946511) That, too, is not possible.
('6', 484, 1, 19, 946539) In our view, the men of the Punjab and the others who carry on the agitation are brave men.
('6', 484, 1, 20, 946631) They are patriots and endure hardships for the sake of the country.
('6', 484, 1, 21, 946699) To that extent they command our respect.
('6', 484, 1, 22, 946740) However, they appear to be in error in so far as they want to eliminate British rule.
('6', 484, 1, 23, 946826) In pursuit of this end, they appear determined to suffer any punishment the law may inflict on them.
('6', 484, 1, 24, 946927) We have nothing to blame them for.
('6', 484, 1, 25, 946962) For, their sufferings will lead to Indias happiness.
('6', 484, 1, 26, 947015) They oppose British rule because of its drawbacks.
('6', 484, 1, 27, 947066) Because of that rule, India is becoming poorer.
('6', 484, 1, 28, 947114) To some extent, British rule is an important cause of even the plague in India.
('6', 484, 1, 29, 947194) It adds to the ill will between Hindus and Muslims.
('6', 484, 1, 30, 947246) It is also because of that rule that we have been reduced to such a low state and live like cowards.
('6', 484, 1, 31, 947347) Exasperated by these evils, some Indian leaders find fault with the entire British nation.
('6', 484, 1, 32, 947438) Their revolt will probably remove these draw backs to some extent.
('6', 484, 1, 33, 947505) Moreover, since they are our own fellow countrymen, we ought not to nurse ill feeling against them.
('6', 484, 1, 34, 947605) Rather, we

('6', 485, 0, 1, 947736) 486 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 485, 1, 2, 947778) ought to admire their heroism.
('6', 485, 1, 3, 947809) The fault, in fact, lies with us.
('6', 485, 1, 4, 947843) If we remove the fault, British rule, which is a cause of misery today, can become a source of happiness.
('6', 485, 1, 5, 947949) Public spirit is not likely to grow among us without western education and contacts with the West.
('6', 485, 1, 6, 948048) If that spirit grows, the British may grant our demands even without a fight, and may leave India if we want them to do so.
('6', 485, 1, 7, 948172) The British colonies are what they are, not because the people there are white, but because they are brave and would take offence if their rights were not granted.
('6', 485, 1, 8, 948336) That is why they are regarded as members of one family.
('6', 485, 1, 9, 948392) In short, we have no quarrel with British rule.
('6', 485, 1, 10, 948440) We have to be proud of the courage of those who have been creating this unrest.
('6', 485, 1, 11, 948520) Let us show the same courage ourselves, but instead of desiring the end of British rule, let us aspire to be as able and spirited as the Colonists are, and demand and secure the rights we want.
('6', 485, 1, 12, 948714) And at the same time, let us learn and follow the good points of British rule, and so become more capable.

('6', 485, 4, 15, 948882) His Majesty the late Amir Abdur Rahman 1 has said:
('6', 485, 5, 16, 948933) During my visit I saw one sorry sight which affected my mind very much.
('6', 485, 5, 17, 949005) The dress of the poor Indian princes resembled that of women.
('6', 485, 5, 18, 949067) They had diamond pins in their hair, pendants in their ears, bands on their wrists, gold chains round their necks, and other ornaments such as women wear.
('6', 485, 5, 19, 949222) Their trouserbelts were studded with jewels and the pendants, hanging from their waistribbons, almost reached their feet.
('6', 485, 5, 20, 949344) Theyallowed in ignorance, indolence and luxury.
('6', 485, 5, 21, 949392) They little knew what was happening in the world or what it contained.
('6', 485, 5, 22, 949463) They passed their time in consuming wine and opium.
('6', 485, 5, 23, 949515) They believed that their status would be lowered if they went on foot.
('6', 485, 6, 24, 949586) This is, for the most part, a true picture.
('6', 485, 6, 25, 949630) It can be said that there

('6', 486, 1, 2, 949746) are Indian princes who do not live in this manner.
('6', 486, 1, 3, 949797) But we are not concerned with them at the moment.
('6', 486, 1, 4, 949847) The fact is that the state of affairs described above is one powerful cause of our miserable plight.
('6', 486, 1, 5, 949948) It is not only the princes that live in such a base manner.
('6', 486, 1, 6, 950008) Among the people also this state of things is seen often enough.
('6', 486, 1, 7, 950073) Our comment mainly refers to the Hindus in India.
('6', 486, 1, 8, 950123) The so called big men and their children are mostly recognized by the marks vividly described by the late Amir.
('6', 486, 1, 9, 950235) Luxuries, ornaments, garments of silk or brocadethese are seen to be quite common with them.
('6', 486, 1, 10, 950328) If the so called modern people do not wear ornaments, etc., they satisfy their desire in other ways.
('6', 486, 1, 11, 950429) It is no use blaming any one section for this.
('6', 486, 1, 12, 950476) Customs coming down from ancient times die hard.
('6', 486, 1, 13, 950525) But we Indians in South Africa have to learn the lesson that all of us, big or small, should free ourselves from these faults.
('6', 486, 1, 14, 950652) The condition of our country and of ourselves is so unsatisfactory that, at present, we are in a state of continuous mourning.
('6', 486, 1, 15, 950779) How can we enjoy comfort or pleasure, when every week thousands of our countrymen die of plague or starvation?
('6', 486, 1, 16, 950890) We are convinced that it is necessary for every Indian to colour his mind with the yellow of a monks robe.
('6', 486, 1, 17, 950997) His outfit should display none of the evils of jewellery, silk, gold, etc.

('6', 486, 3, 19, 951088) Our London Letter in this issue lends weighty support to what we have said above.
('6', 486, 3, 20, 951170) King Emperor Edwards grandson is 13 years old today.
('6', 486, 3, 21, 951223) From now on he is being made to go through a rigorous training.
('6', 486, 3, 22, 951287) The Prince is required to study at school with other boys and he will be served the same simple food that the others get.
('6', 486, 3, 23, 951409) A people ruled over by such a King does what the King does.
('6', 486, 3, 24, 951469) Is it any wonder that such a people are prosperous?
('6', 486, 3, 25, 951521) We are not to envy them, but to become like them.
('6', 486, 3, 26, 951571) Let it not be argued that they, too, have their pleasures and luxuries.
('6', 486, 3, 27, 951643) Such a thought bespeaks indolence.
('6', 486, 3, 28, 951678) They enjoy themselves after their work is done, and their luxuries become them well enough.
('6', 486, 3, 29, 951770) Even so, we are not to imitate their weakness for a life of pleasure and comfort.

('6', 487, 1, 2, 952065) 402. JOHANNESBURG LETTER 1
('6', 487, 2, 3, 952092) NEW LAW: MORE QUESTIONS
('6', 487, 3, 4, 952116) Questions about this law are still coming in.
('6', 487, 3, 5, 952162) I am glad of it, and all questions so received will be dealt with in this journal.
('6', 487, 4, 6, 952245) WHAT SHOULD BE DONE BY THOSE HOLDING DUTCH REGISTERS?
('6', 487, 5, 7, 952299) According to the notice in the Gazette, an Indian has made an application to the Permit Office on the basis of his register 2. In that connection, Mr. Mahomed Daoji Patel from Wakkerstroom makes the following enquiries: (1) Can it be taken as a certainty that the application will be accepted by the Permit Office?
('6', 487, 5, 8, 952614) (2) If it is accepted, should the applicant withdraw it, since it violates the Fourth Resolution?
('6', 487, 5, 9, 952712) (3) In case the application is withdrawn, will the police arrest him?
('6', 487, 5, 10, 952782) (4) If he is arrested and the magistrate orders him to leave the Transvaal, what is he to do?
('6', 487, 5, 11, 952876) (5) If on his acting thus a case is instituted against him, will Mr. Gandhi come here to defend him?
('6', 487, 5, 12, 952977) The answers are: Neither this man nor anyone else in his situation need withdraw the application so long as the new law has not been gazetted.
('6', 487, 5, 13, 953120) And it is also unnecessary now to proceed in the matter of the said application.
('6', 487, 5, 14, 953201) The application will have to be withdrawn as soon as the new law is gazetted.
('6', 487, 5, 15, 953279) If the matter comes up before the magistrate, the said applicant or others in his position who a rightful holders of registers will be defended by Mr. Gandhi.
('6', 487, 5, 16, 953438) As for the nature of the defence, please refer to earlier news letters.
('6', 487, 5, 17, 953510) The boycott of the Permit Office means that henceforth we shall have nothing to do with that Office.
('6', 487, 5, 18, 953611) The cases of the Transvaal residents that may be pending in that Office need not be withdrawn.
('6', 487, 5, 19, 953706) That step is to be taken immediately after the law is gazetted.
('6', 487, 6, 20, 953770) 1 Literally, the tide reads News Letter.

('6', 488, 1, 2, 954109) WHAT IF MR. GANDHI IS SENT TO GAOL FIRST?
('6', 488, 2, 3, 954151) A correspondent asks what is to be done for defence if Mr. Gandhi is imprisoned first.
('6', 488, 2, 4, 954238) It is a relevant question.
('6', 488, 2, 5, 954265) But one mustknow what the defence by Mr. Gandhi is going to be.
('6', 488, 2, 6, 954329) The defence will only state that it was upon his advice that people had taken the firm decision to go to gaol, and that he (Mr. Gandhi), therefore, deserved to be sentenced first.
('6', 488, 2, 7, 954509) If such a defence by him is rendered unnecessary and he is straight away taken to gaol first, the defence would have already been made.
('6', 488, 2, 8, 954645) The main aim of Mr. Gandhis presence is to keep up the courage of the accused.
('6', 488, 2, 9, 954724) People will have nothing to fear if, fortunately for the community and for Mr. Gandhi, he is sent to gaol first.
('6', 488, 2, 10, 954837) Even while in gaol, Mr. Gandhi can put up a defence, that is, he can pray to God to give courage to all Indians.
('6', 488, 2, 11, 954950) At this stage, I should also add that it is mainly because the new law is humiliating that all Indians accept the gaol resolution.
('6', 488, 2, 12, 955081) Thus, the only conclusion is that every Indian must maintain his self respect.
('6', 488, 3, 13, 955160) WHERE ARE FUNDS TO SUPPORT WOMEN AND CHILDREN?
('6', 488, 4, 14, 955207) The person raising this question asks how maintenance can be provided when the Associations funds are meagre.
('6', 488, 4, 15, 955317) The law has not yet been gazetted.
('6', 488, 4, 16, 955352) As soon as it is, leaders will visit every place to explain matters to the people and raise contributions.
('6', 488, 4, 17, 955459) Moreover, leaders in Natal and East London have already communicated their willingness to help.
('6', 488, 4, 18, 955555) It has also been arranged that if Mr. Gandhi should be imprisoned, Mr. Polak, the editor of Indian Opinion, will go from place to place collecting funds, encouraging people and explaining the position to them.
('6', 488, 4, 19, 955765) Some whites also have indicated their willingness to help.
('6', 488, 5, 20, 955824) GERMISTON LOCATION
('6', 488, 6, 21, 955843) Passes, like those of the Kaffirs 1, used to be issued to Indians at the Germiston Location.
('6', 488, 6, 22, 955936) In this connection, the British Indian Association had addressed a letter to the local Government and to this a reply has been received stating that such passes would not be issued in future.
('6', 488, 6, 23, 956128) Those living in the Locations may, therefore, get their passes framed and keep them as exhibits.
('6', 488, 6, 24, 956225) If they are asked again to take out

('6', 489, 2, 3, 956516) STRIKE OF MINE LABOURERS We have been talking of boycotting the Permit Office and going to gaol.
('6', 489, 2, 4, 956613) The white labourers in the mines have struck work with a view to getting higher wages.
('6', 489, 2, 5, 956700) The result was that in about ten mines work came to a standstill.
('6', 489, 2, 6, 956766) Everyone knows that these miners live from hand to mouth.
('6', 489, 2, 7, 956824) Some of them are married.
('6', 489, 2, 8, 956850) For the sake of their rights, they have walked out of the mines, giving up their present income, without bothering about their families and their means of livelihood.
('6', 489, 2, 9, 957017) There is no question of their self respect having been wounded.
('6', 489, 2, 10, 957081) Yet, for the sake of what they believe to be their right, they have girded up theirloins against the authorities and the fabulously rich mine owners.
('6', 489, 2, 11, 957231) Whether their demands are reasonable or not need not be considered just now.
('6', 489, 2, 12, 957308) On this occasion, it is their spirit and their daring that we are to think of and emulate.
('6', 489, 3, 13, 957399) ENCOURAGEMENT PROM EAST LONDON AND KIMBERLEYS WRONG VIEW The President of the Association has received a letter of sympathy from the Indians of East London.
('6', 489, 3, 14, 957556) Mr. A. G. Ismail hopes that all Indians will remain firm in disobeying the law and will go to gaol.
('6', 489, 3, 15, 957656) He also says that help will be sent from there.
('6', 489, 3, 16, 957704) On the other hand, there is a telegram from Kimberley expressing sympathy but asking the Indian community to think well before taking the step of going to gaol.
('6', 489, 3, 17, 957865) This is a wrong view.
('6', 489, 3, 18, 957887) The Indian community believes in God, and will not trifle with Him.
('6', 489, 3, 19, 957955) Moreover, it was after mature deliberation that the gaol resolution was passed in September.
('6', 489, 3, 20, 958048) It is the duty of every Indian, therefore, to give us, residents of the Transvaal, full encouragement and to pray to God to sustain our courage at the time of our real test.
('6', 489, 4, 21, 958222) INDIANS IN GERMAN EAST AFRICA
('6', 489, 5, 22, 958252) The Star correspondent in England states in a cable that, at a meeting of the German Colonial Society in Germany, some members said that Indian merchants in German East Africa harmed the interests of small European traders.
('6', 489, 5, 23, 958476) The Indians cheated the Kaffirs.
('6', 489, 5, 24, 958509) It was they who incited the rebellion.
('6', 489, 5, 25, 958548) Therefore, laws like those enacted against them in South Africa should be enacted in German East Africa, too.
('6', 489, 5, 26, 958658) The Societys committee has reported that, though it was
('6', 490, 0, 1, 958714) VOL. 6: 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 491
('6', 490, 1, 2, 958757) possible to level some charges against the Indian traders, their presence in the land had on the whole proved to be an advantage.
('6', 490, 1, 3, 958887) It was likely that any attempt to make a law for deporting them would lead to complications with England.
('6', 490, 1, 4, 958993) Some other members who were acquainted with the situation prevailing in the Colony defended the Indian traders.
('6', 490, 2, 5, 959105) PENALTY FOR GIVING FALSE EVIDENCE
('6', 490, 3, 6, 959139) A washerman named Ponnusami was put up before Sir William Smith for giving false evidence.
('6', 490, 3, 7, 959230) Ponnusami had made unfounded allegations against other Indians who, he knew, were innocent.
('6', 490, 3, 8, 959322) The jury found Ponnusami guilty.
('6', 490, 3, 9, 959355) The judge sentenced him to rigorous imprisonment for 18 months.
('6', 490, 3, 10, 959419) Those Indians who are not afraid of giving false evidence should take a warning from this case.
('6', 490, 4, 11, 959515) MOVEMENT TO CLOSE SHOPS AT FIXED HOUR
('6', 490, 5, 12, 959553) A proposal for the closing of shops at a fixed hour was discussed in the Johannesburg Town Council on the 22nd [May].
('6', 490, 5, 13, 959671) Owing to the many divergent views expressed at the meeting, the members could not agree on a solution.
('6', 490, 5, 14, 959774) They therefore decided thatthe whole matter should go to the Parliament for decision.
('6', 490, 5, 15, 959860) The Councils proposal was also forwarded to the Parliament at the same time.
('6', 490, 5, 16, 959937) The proposal provides in effect that ordinarily shops should close at 6 p.m., on Wednesdays at I p.m.
('6', 490, 5, 17, 960039) and on Saturdays at .9 p.m.
('6', 490, 5, 18, 960067) On holidays they should remain closed altogether.
('6', 490, 5, 19, 960117) When shops are closed, the hawkers too should stop going on their rounds.
('6', 490, 5, 20, 960191) The law to this effect has not yet been passed, but one may take it that it is about to be.
('6', 490, 5, 21, 960283) The Indian who concedes the need for early closure of shops and acts accordingly of his own free will, will find himself at an advantage over others.
('6', 490, 6, 22, 960433) LAND TAX IN JOHANNESBURG
('6', 490, 7, 23, 960458) The tax on land is fixed this time at a penny and a quarter per 100. The tax will be calculated for the period from January 1, 1907 to June 30, 1907, and will be due on June 24, 1907. Those who fail to pay it by that date will have to pay interest at the monthly rate of one pound per 100.

('6', 491, 1, 2, 960790) CHINESE MEETING AND GAOL RESOLUTION
('6', 491, 2, 3, 960826) Last Sunday a meeting of the Chinese Association was held in its hall.
('6', 491, 2, 4, 960897) About 300 Chinese, mostly merchants, were present.
('6', 491, 2, 5, 960948) Mr. M. Quinn took the chair.
('6', 491, 2, 6, 960977) Mr. Gandhi also attended by invitation.
('6', 491, 3, 7, 961017) Explaining the position, he said that the Chinese and the Indians had been classed together under the new law.
('6', 491, 3, 8, 961128) The law humiliated the Asiatics and it should not therefore be accepted by the Chinese.
('6', 491, 3, 9, 961216) The various questions that are answered in this letter were all raised and answered at the meeting.
('6', 491, 3, 10, 961316) In the end, it was decided that every Chinese should declare on oath, in accordance with his religion, that in no case would he take out a new permit and that, if necessary, he would be prepared to face imprisonment.
('6', 491, 4, 11, 961533) PERMIT CASE
('6', 491, 5, 12, 961545) A permit case has been going on for some days past against an Indian named Lala.
('6', 491, 5, 13, 961626) It came up for hearing on the 27th before Mr. Wenderburg.
('6', 491, 5, 14, 961684) Superintendent Vernon deposed as follows:
('6', 491, 6, 15, 961726) I have the power to ask for permits from people.
('6', 491, 6, 16, 961775) It is also my duty to investigate the rights of people who want to enter with permits.
('6', 491, 6, 17, 961862) On April 20, I saw Lala near my office, and he said to me, I wish to work with you.
('6', 491, 6, 18, 961946) Many men desire to take out permits.
('6', 491, 6, 19, 961983) If you supply me information about them, both of us will make much money.
('6', 491, 6, 20, 962057) I shall charge everyone 20 of which I shall give you 8. There are many Indians and Chinese here with false permits.
('6', 491, 6, 21, 962173) If you get their permits set right, I shall pay you 20. Here is a permit; put yourinitials on it and pass it.
('6', 491, 6, 22, 962283) That way you will earn 400 a month, and I 200. Mr. Harris too will get 200. My information is that irregular forms are current in Johannesburg and that many Indians are without permits. Then I asked him to come again the following day.
('6', 491, 6, 23, 962519) He did come, and after some talk with him, I rang the bell and got him arrested.
('6', 491, 6, 24, 962600) As he was being taken to the Charge Office, Lala said, Sir, you have missed a golden opportunity of making money.
('6', 491, 7, 25, 962714) Constable Harris also deposed as above.

('6', 492, 1, 2, 962952) My duty is to scrutinize all applications for permits.
('6', 492, 1, 3, 963007) A permit would be very rarely granted if the police report were unfavourable.
('6', 492, 1, 4, 963085) My decision in the matter would be final, though the Governor has the power to alter it.
('6', 492, 1, 5, 963174) The applications of Indians are placed by me before the Colonial Secretary.
('6', 492, 1, 6, 963250) Lala came to me twice.
('6', 492, 1, 7, 963273) He said that some Indians had false permits.
('6', 492, 1, 8, 963318) Once I had allowed him to come by rail without a ticket, as he said that he would give me some information.
('6', 492, 1, 9, 963426) But he brought none.In his deposition, Lala said: An Indian approached me for a permit I said no to him.
('6', 492, 1, 10, 963531) Then he showed me a permit which was not in order.
('6', 492, 1, 11, 963582) Thereupon, I went to Mr. Chamney and told him that the man had to pay 30 for the permit.
('6', 492, 1, 12, 963671) Mr. Chamney asked me to take the man to his office.
('6', 492, 1, 13, 963723) Then I went to Mr. Vernon and offered him money so as to be able to give information to Mr. Chamney.
('6', 492, 1, 14, 963824) My intention was to know how false permits were being issued, for I was likely to get a reward for giving infor mation about them.
('6', 492, 1, 15, 963955) I am a loyal subject of His Majesty the King Emperor and had hoped that for my loyalty I would get a Government job.
('6', 492, 1, 16, 964072) No definite amount had been fixed.
('6', 492, 1, 17, 964107) Harris had said that one Indian had agreed to pay 100. Before I had made up my mind, I was arrested.
('6', 492, 1, 18, 964208) The Public Prosecutor asked Lala questions about a letter received from Pretoria.
('6', 492, 1, 19, 964290) Lala replied that the letter had not been correctly translated.
('6', 492, 1, 20, 964354) Mr. Thompson, therefore, asked for a weeks time again and the case was adjourned to June 4.

('6', 492, 5, 24, 964510) An Indian savant has written in The Indian Sociologist proposing the establishment of a society of servants of India.
('6', 492, 5, 25, 964628) We give here a summary of what he has said.
('6', 492, 5, 26, 964672) That India should become united and independent is an idea that many Indians now understand and cherish.
('6', 492, 5, 27, 964777) But the moral energy needed to achieve this aim is wanting.
('6', 492, 5, 28, 964837) Those who would serve their country should first realize that ones life is not to be spent in pampering oneself with easy living, but that it is to be used in doing

('6', 493, 1, 2, 965063) ones duty.
('6', 493, 1, 3, 965074) The population of India comprises one fifth of the worlds population.
('6', 493, 1, 4, 965144) The task of promoting its uplift belongs to the servants of India.
('6', 493, 1, 5, 965211) These servants are the trustees of the Indian people.
('6', 493, 1, 6, 965265) They should give up the desire for wealth, status and physical comforts, and dedicate their lives to India.
('6', 493, 1, 7, 965373) Fear of every kind must be overcome.
('6', 493, 1, 8, 965410) Such service should be regarded as part of ones religion.
('6', 493, 1, 9, 965468) Men of such patriotism will be able to imbue the people with enthusiasm by their actions rather than by their words.
('6', 493, 1, 10, 965585) Besides ardour, knowledge and wisdom will also be required.
('6', 493, 1, 11, 965645) Hence the Servants of India should know the history of India.
('6', 493, 1, 12, 965707) They should understand what India needs now.
('6', 493, 1, 13, 965752) They should also study the history of other countries.
('6', 493, 1, 14, 965807) This enthusiasm and knowledge cannot remain fresh for long in a man burdened with the responsibilities of a family.
('6', 493, 1, 15, 965923) A true servant will need to observe total celibacy.
('6', 493, 1, 16, 965975) Those who are married but wish to render service to the country can train the members of their families to take up the same kind of work.
('6', 493, 1, 17, 966113) Indian women are ignorant.
('6', 493, 1, 18, 966140) It is very necessary to awaken patriotism in them.
('6', 493, 1, 19, 966191) But those, who are not married and wish to render service as explained above will find it best not to marry.
('6', 493, 1, 20, 966300) The great patriot Mazzini 1 used to say that it was to his country that he was married.
('6', 493, 1, 21, 966388) In conclusion, he who wants to be a servant of the people needs faith.
('6', 493, 1, 22, 966459) He should not worry as to where he would get his next meal from.
('6', 493, 1, 23, 966524) God will provide for all His creatures.

('6', 494, 3, 4, 967063) SIR, As the Asiatic Registration Act is still the subject of correspondence between the Imperial Government and the local Government, I have been directed by my Association to seek an interview with the Prime Minister in order to submit to him a proposal which might obviate the necessity of gazetting the Act.
('6', 494, 3, 5, 967374) In any case, my Association would be deeply grateful, should General Botha find time to receive the deputation on behalf of my Association before any further steps are taken in connection with the Act.
('6', 494, 3, 6, 967576) I shall, therefore, be obliged if you will kindly ascertain whether and when it will be suitable for the Prime Minister to receive a small deputation on behalf of my Association.

('6', 494, 10, 13, 968121) 1 This was reproduced in Indian Opinion, 22 6 1907. 2 The Prime Minister, however, did not receive the deputation.

('6', 495, 1, 2, 968375) the practice of the Licensing Officers in discriminating between Indian applicants and others to the disadvantage of the former is reprehensible and unjust, especially when it is a matter of existing trade rights.
('6', 495, 1, 3, 968589) Mr. Robinson also thinks that, if the Colony wishes to deal with the Indian question, it should do so in a straightforward, bold and honest manner.
('6', 495, 1, 4, 968737) We congratulate him on having ranged himself so honourably on the side of justice and equity.
('6', 495, 1, 5, 968831) If all our legislators would adopt the same bold attitude, the Colony would soon rid itself of a great deal of cant and hypocrisy.

('6', 495, 4, 8, 969017) We draw attention to the gruesome story a correspondent from Mafeking tells about the working of the Cape Immigration Restriction Act.
('6', 495, 4, 9, 969152) According to our correspondent, Indians who have returned to India, leaving their businesses ten years old and having landed property at the Cape, find it difficult to return if they are not in possession of certificates of domicile taken out by them prior to their departure, and that, similarly, Indians having been resident for a number of years find it difficult to obtain such certificates, on leaving.
('6', 495, 4, 10, 969560) He adds that when they are issued, they are tenable only for one year, so that if an Indian returns to his adopted home in the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope a day later than the period given in thecertificate, he would be a prohibited immigrant.
('6', 495, 4, 11, 969808) A system such as this can only be described as a deliberate and cruel attempt to drive Indians out of the Cape without having to pay them any compensation whatsoever.
('6', 495, 4, 12, 969975) The remedy is largely in the hands of the Cape Indians, and we warn the various associations there that they will be responsible to the community should the threatened disaster befall British Indians, and should they, five years hence, find that there are very few Indians to be found at the Cape.
('6', 495, 4, 13, 970273) We would advise our correspondent to contin ually address the Indian associations at Cape Town until they are roused to action from their apparent lethargy.

('6', 496, 2, 3, 970534) A TERRIBLE CONTRAST
('6', 496, 3, 4, 970554) Whilst Indians are showing their firm determination not to submit to the Asiatic Registration Act, it is as well to understand their objection to it.
('6', 496, 3, 5, 970704) I, therefore, propose to show in parallel columns the state that they are in now and that in which they would be under the new law.
('6', 496, 4, 6, 970836) NOW UNDER THE NEW LAW
('6', 496, 5, 7, 970858) 1. Malays are subject to Law 3 of 1885. 1. They are exempted from the new law.
('6', 496, 5, 8, 970937) Many Indians have Malay wives and relatives.
('6', 496, 5, 9, 970982) The position of such Indians when they meet their Malay relatives can be better imagined than described.
('6', 496, 5, 10, 971087) 2. Every Asiatic in posse ssion of a permit bona fide obtained is a full fledged and lawful resident of the Transvaal.
('6', 496, 6, 11, 971206) 2. He becomes dispossessed of this title and the burden of showing that the permit lawfully held by him was not fraudulently obtained is thrown on him to entitle him to receive the new registration certificate.
('6', 496, 6, 12, 971417) 3. An Asiatic child born since the 31st day of May, 1902 in the Orange River Colony, is entitled to enter and remain in the Transvaal.
('6', 496, 7, 13, 971552) 3. Such child is debarred.
('6', 496, 8, 14, 971579) 4. Present permits held by Asiatics entitle them to enter and reside in the Transvaal and Orange River Colony.
('6', 496, 8, 15, 971690) Whether these are of any use for going into the Orange River Colony is not the question.
('6', 496, 9, 16, 971779) 4. This right, so far as the permit can give it, is taken away.
('6', 496, 10, 17, 971843) 5. Asiatics holding permits 5. These are not allowed.
('6', 496, 11, 18, 971897) 1 This appeared as Specially Contributed.

('6', 497, 1, 3, 972151) 6. Present permits cannot be changed without the consent of the holders.
('6', 497, 2, 4, 972224) 6. They are subject to altera tion at the will of the Government.
('6', 497, 3, 5, 972290) 7. Asiatic children are not required to take out permits.
('6', 497, 3, 6, 972348) 7. The guardian of such child is bound, under heavy penalty, to have particulars of identification of: such child, no matter how young, endorsed on his registration.
('6', 497, 3, 7, 972514) When the child reaches the age of 8 years, the guardian is bound to again app roach the Registrar and take out registration for such child, furnishing further particulars as to identification, etc.
('6', 497, 4, 8, 972712) 8. Minors who are at present in the Transvaal are entitled to remain without a permit, and are not liable to leave the country on attaining majority.
('6', 497, 5, 9, 972862) 8. All such boys on reaching the age of 16 are liable to be deported unless they obtain from the Registrar registration certificates, the granting of which is at his discretion.
('6', 497, 5, 10, 973040) 9. No Asiatic is bound to furnish particulars of identification
('6', 497, 6, 11, 973104) 9. Even a Kafir policeman may demand production of certificate and particulars of identi fication, which may be fixed by regulation from time to tirne.
('6', 497, 6, 12, 973256) Such policeman may, notwithstanding, take the Asiatic to the nearest police station, where the same inquiry may be repeated, and, if the Officer at the station is not satisfied, he may detain the Asiatic in the cell overnight.
('6', 497, 6, 13, 973483) 10. An Asiatic can 10. No Asiatic may receive
('6', 498, 0, 1, 973529) VOL. 6: 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 499
('6', 498, 1, 2, 973572) demand a trade licence as a right against payment without production of permit.
('6', 498, 2, 3, 973652) such licence unless he produces his registration certificate and furnishes means of identification, as may be prescribed by regulation.
('6', 498, 2, 4, 973788) If, there fore, there are partners in any Asiatic firm, the Licensing Officer may insist upon the presence of all the parties and submit them to a humiliating examination before giving them their licence.
('6', 498, 2, 5, 973993) 11. Any Asiatic is free to employ any other Asiatic.
('6', 498, 2, 6, 974046) 11. Any Asiatic who brings into the Colony an Asiatic under the age of 16 (even his son!) without a permit for him, or who employs such child, is liable to be heavily fined or sent to gaol, and to have his own right to reside in the Transvaal cancelled.
('6', 498, 2, 7, 974300) 12. The Registrar, at pre sent, has fairly strong authority.
('6', 498, 2, 8, 974361) 12. The Registrar practically becomes the master of Asiatics with almost unlimited power over their personal liberty.
('6', 498, 2, 9, 974479) 13. Asiatics who come in possession of certificates belonging to others commit no crime.
('6', 498, 3, 10, 974568) 13. Asiatics having such certificates (evidently a father having his sons register) are bound to deliver same by post under pain of being fined 50 or, in default, sent to gaol.
('6', 498, 4, 11, 974745) ADDITIONAL POINTS TO BE NOTED
('6', 498, 5, 12, 974775) The new law does not apply to Kaffirs, to Cape Boys, and Christian subjects of the Turkish Empire, whereas it applies to the Mahomedan subjects of that Empire, and it thus insults Indians and their religion in a cold blooded manner.
('6', 498, 5, 13, 975008) It reduces them to a state of serfdom although belonging to civilized countries.
('6', 498, 5, 14, 975089) It reduces them to a position lower than that of the Kaffirs, Cape Boys and Malays.
('6', 498, 5, 15, 975173) 2. It puts a premium on fraud.
('6', 498, 5, 16, 975204) It might have occurred to the framers of the law that there is nothing to prevent an Asiatic
('6', 499, 0, 1, 975297) 500 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 499, 1, 2, 975339) impersonating a Malay or Cape Boy.
('6', 499, 1, 3, 975374) 3. It opens up a fertile field for permit agents to prey upon harmless Asiatics.
('6', 499, 1, 4, 975455) It must be well known to the Permit authorities that Asiatics are not, as a rule, capable of filling in complicated applicationforms, being ignorant of the ways of Government departments and easily terrorized.
('6', 499, 1, 5, 975665) At the very least, therefore, assuming that Indians and Chinese combined would make 12,000 applicants, they would be robbed of 36,000, counting the fee at 3 per head on an average.
('6', 499, 1, 6, 975846) Who, then, can wonder if Asiatics prefer gaol to submission to such an extraordinary law and to such extortion?
('6', 499, 1, 7, 975958) Verily, the whole of the Transvaal would to them become, during their residence therein, a wretched gaol.
('6', 499, 1, 8, 976064) It does, indeed, need the intoxication of power to blind one to the wretched state of misery to which the new law reduces Asiatics.
('6', 499, 1, 9, 976196) Indian Opinion, 8 6 1907
('6', 499, 2, 10, 976221) 409. NEW OBNOXIOUS LAW
('6', 499, 3, 11, 976244) Futile is strength devoid of courage, Doomed is a house divided; Naught is wealth without knowledge, And evil the use of learning by the wicked.
('6', 499, 3, 12, 976389) A summary of this Act was published in our issue of September 1[1906].
('6', 499, 3, 13, 976460) Even so, we give here a more detailed translation, so that people may form a correct judgment on the real nature of the Act.
('6', 499, 3, 14, 976585) Between the summary of the Act published by us in September and the Act that has now been passed, there is some difference that is worth noting.
('6', 499, 3, 15, 976730) The Act as it stands now is even more anti Indian than the original version.
('6', 499, 3, 16, 976807) 1. Law No.
('6', 499, 3, 17, 976818) 3 of 1885 will remain in force with modifications that follow.
('6', 499, 3, 18, 976881) 2. The term Asiatic will mean Indians, coolies, and Muslim subjects of Turkey.
('6', 499, 3, 19, 976960) It will not include Malays and the Chinese who had come in as indentured labourers.
('6', 499, 3, 20, 977044) (There are other definitions, of Registrar, etc., which are not given here.) 3. Every Asiatic lawfully residing in the Transvaal must
('6', 500, 0, 1, 977178) VOL. 6: 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 501
('6', 500, 1, 2, 977221) register himself.
('6', 500, 1, 3, 977239) There will be no fee for such registration.
('6', 500, 2, 4, 977283) Asiatics of the following description will be deemed lawful residents of the Transvaal:
('6', 500, 3, 5, 977371) (a) Any Asiatic who holds a permit under the Permit Act, unless such permit was fraudulently obtained.
('6', 500, 3, 6, 977474) (Temporary permits are not covered by this.) (b) Any Asiatic resident and actually in the Transvaal on the 31st of May, 1902. (c) Any Asiatic born in the Transvaal after the 31st of May, 1902. 4. Every Asiatic resident in the Transvaal at the date of the taking effect of this Act shall apply for registration to such officer, at such place and before such date as may be prescribed by the Colonial Secretary.

('6', 500, 3, 8, 978084) (a) It is not necessary to make an application under this clause for a child under the age of eight years.
('6', 500, 3, 9, 978191) (b) For the registration of a child above eight years and under sixteen years, the application shall be made by his guardian and, if not so made, shall be made by such child within one month after attaining the age of sixteen years.

('6', 500, 4, 11, 978587) If the Registrar rejects the application of any Asiatic, he will give to the person concerned at least fourteen days notice to appear before a magistrate.
('6', 500, 4, 12, 978742) If he fails to appear at the time specified, or having appeared fails to satisfy the magistrate as to his right to remain in the Transvaal, the magistrate shall order such Asiatic to leave the Transvaal if he is above sixteen years of age.
('6', 500, 4, 13, 978982) On the other hand, if the magistrate is satisfied that the Asiatic concerned is lawfully resident in the Transvaal, he shall order the Registrar to issue him the certificate of registration.
('6', 500, 5, 14, 979173) 6. Any Asiatic who is the guardian of a child under eight shall, upon making application for registration on his own
('6', 501, 0, 1, 979290) 502 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 501, 1, 2, 979332) behalf, supply to the Registrar such particulars and furnish such means of identification in respect of the child as may be prescribed by regulation.
('6', 501, 1, 3, 979482) If the applicant is himself registered, such particulars shall be noted on the register.

('6', 501, 1, 7, 980124) (b) If the guardian does not apply, or if the application made by the guardian is rejected, the application for registration shall be made by the child within one month after reaching the age of sixteen.
('6', 501, 1, 8, 980328) The Resident Magistrate at whose office such applica tion is made shall cause the application along with the relevant documents to be forwarded to the Registrar who shall, if satis fied that the same is in order, issue a certificate 7. of registration.When the guardian has not, as required above, furnished the particulars of a child under the age of eight years and has not made application for registration on behalf of the child after he had attained the age of eight years, the application shall be made by the child within one month after he attains the age of sixteen, and the Registrar may issue a certificate of registration in his discretion.
('6', 501, 1, 9, 980981) 8. Any person who shall fail to make application for registration as required by this Act shall be liable to a fine not exceeding 100 and, in default of payment, to imprisonment with or without hard labour for a period not exceeding three months.
('6', 501, 1, 10, 981228) Any person who brings into the Transvaal an Asiatic under the age of sixteen years not lawfully resident in the Transvaal, and any person who shall employ such child, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to the penalties mentioned above and to cancellation of his certificate of registration, in addition to which he will be ordered to leave the Transvaal.
('6', 501, 1, 11, 981598) If he does not leave the Transvaal, he will be liable
('6', 502, 0, 1, 981652) VOL. 6: 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 503
('6', 502, 1, 2, 981695) to a fine or to imprisonment, as provided in the law.
('6', 502, 1, 3, 981749) Any Asiatic over the age of sixteen years who is found in the Transvaal without a registration certificate after such date as may be notified by the Colonial Secretary will be ordered to leave the Transvaal, and if he does not leave the Transvaal, shall be liable to a fine or to imprisonment.
('6', 502, 1, 4, 982043) If an Asiatic who has failed to make application for registration shall satisfy the magistrate that such failure was due to some good and sufficient cause, the magistrate may give him time to make such application.
('6', 502, 1, 5, 982258) If the person fails to obtain registration within the appointed time, he shall again be ordered to leave the Transvaal, and if he fails to do so, shall be liable to the usual penalties.
('6', 502, 2, 6, 982444) 9.

('6', 502, 4, 11, 983451) 12. Any person who loses his certificate of registration shall apply to the Registrar to have it renewed.
('6', 502, 4, 12, 983557) The application shall contain such particulars as may be required under the rules, and it must have a 5s stamp affixed to it.

('6', 503, 1, 3, 984062) 14. Whenever the age of any Asiatic is in question, such Asiatic shall, unless and until the contrary be proved, be taken to be of the age which the Registrar shall certify to be in his opinion the apparent age of such Asiatic.
('6', 503, 1, 4, 984290) 15. Any affidavit that may have to be made under this Act shall be exempt from stamp duty.
('6', 503, 1, 5, 984381) 16.

('6', 503, 1, 7, 985079) The provisions of Section 9 shall apply to such permits, and temporary permits issued before the date of the taking effect of this Act shall also be governed by this Act.
('6', 503, 1, 8, 985250) Any person who holds a temporary permit may be exempted from the restrictions on the use of liquor.
('6', 503, 1, 9, 985350) The Colonial Secretary may also grant such exemption to an Asiatic who is not subject to the provisions of this Act.
('6', 503, 1, 10, 985467) 18. The Governor may from time to time make or repeal regulations for any of the following purposes: (1) Prescribing the form of the register to be kept under this Act;

('6', 504, 0, 1, 985805) VOL. 6: 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 505

('6', 504, 1, 3, 986303) (5) Prescribing the form of permit to be.

('6', 504, 2, 9, 987028) IMPLICATIONS OF ACT
('6', 504, 3, 10, 987048) Fortunately for Indians, no Indian is found ready to accept this obnoxious law.
('6', 504, 3, 11, 987128) Nevertheless, we show below how the condition to which Indians will now be reduced will be much worse than what they have suffered so far, so that those Indians who are firm may become stronger in their determination, and those who are wavering in their minds may give up their doubts, may of their own accord break away from the clutches of the Act, remain free and thus prove themselves to be brave men.
('6', 504, 4, 12, 987534) 1. The new law does not apply to Malays, but applies to Indians.
('6', 504, 5, 13, 987599) 2. It does not apply to Kaffirs and Cape Boys.
('6', 504, 6, 14, 987646) 3. It does not apply to Turkish Christians, but does to
('6', 505, 0, 1, 987702) 506 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 505, 1, 2, 987744) [Turkish] Muslims.
('6', 505, 2, 3, 987763) 4. At present, every Indian in possession of a permit bearing his thumb impression is a lawful resident.
('6', 505, 2, 4, 987868) Under the new Act, he becomes dispossessed of this title, and, when applying for a new permit, such Indian will have to show how his earlier valid permit was obtained.
('6', 505, 3, 5, 988036) 5. Present permits cannot be changed without the consent of the holders.
('6', 505, 3, 6, 988109) The permits to be issued under the new Act are subject to alteration at the will of the Government.
('6', 505, 4, 7, 988209) 6. The present permits held by Indians entitle them to enter and reside in the Orange River Colony.
('6', 505, 4, 8, 988309) Whether these are of any use or not is not the question.
('6', 505, 4, 9, 988366) Under this newAct, the name of the Orange River Colony is omitted from the permits.
('6', 505, 5, 10, 988450) 7. At present, Indians holding permits to reside in the Orange River Colony are in a position to enter the Transvaal on the strength thereof.
('6', 505, 5, 11, 988592) Under the new Act, they will not be able to do so.
('6', 505, 6, 12, 988643) 8. At present, no Indian is bound to give his thumb impression or his signature to obtain a permit.
('6', 505, 6, 13, 988743) Under the new Act, by making or modifying rules from time to time at its pleasure, the Government can prescribe the giving of signature or thumb impression, or any other thing to be done, as compulsory.
('6', 505, 7, 14, 988946) 9. At present, only the Permit Secretary is authorized to inspect a permit.
('6', 505, 7, 15, 989022) Under the new Act, every Kaffir police constable can do so.
('6', 505, 8, 16, 989082) 10. Under the new Act, a Kaffir police constable can ask [an Asiatic] for particulars of name and identity, and, if not satisfied, can take him to the police station.
('6', 505, 8, 17, 989249) The Station Officer, if not satisfied with the particulars, may detain the Asiatic in a cell and produce him before a magistrate the next day.
('6', 505, 8, 18, 989392) All this cannot be done under the present Act.
('6', 505, 9, 19, 989439) 11. At present, no permit is required for a child one day old, and no one dare ask for particulars of name and identity in respect of such child.
('6', 505, 9, 20, 989585) Under the new Act, the guardian of
('6', 506, 0, 1, 989620) VOL. 6: 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 507
('6', 506, 1, 2, 989663) such child is bound to have particulars of identification of such child, no matter how young, endorsed on his registr ation.
('6', 506, 2, 3, 989788) 12. At present, an Asiatic child is free after reaching the age of eight.
('6', 506, 2, 4, 989862) Under the new Act, even after having the required particulars endorsed as above, the guardian is bound again to approach the Registrar and take out registration for such child, furnishing further particulars as to identification, etc.
('6', 506, 2, 5, 990097) In case he fails to do so, he will be liable to punishment.
('6', 506, 2, 6, 990157) 13. Asiatic children who are at present in the Transvaal are entitled to remain without a permit, and are not liable to leave the country on attaining majority.
('6', 506, 2, 7, 990318) Under the new Act, all such boys are liable to be deported unless they obtain from the Registrar registration certificates, the granting of which is at his discretion.
('6', 506, 2, 8, 990486) 14. At present, an Asiatic is free to bring with him a child under the age of sixteen without a permit for him.
('6', 506, 2, 9, 990598) Under the new Act, any Asiatic doing so is liable to imprisonment with hard labour, and to have his own registration cancelled.
('6', 506, 2, 10, 990726) 15. At present, any Asiatic can obtain a trading licence without production of a permit.
('6', 506, 2, 11, 990815) Under the new Act, he will have to produce his new register and furnish particulars of name, etc.,and means of identification.
('6', 506, 2, 12, 990942) Which means that if there are partners in an Indian firm, the Licensing Officer may insist upon the presence of all the parties.
('6', 506, 2, 13, 991071) In case they do not remain present, he can refuse to issue the licence.
('6', 506, 2, 14, 991143) 16. At present, the authority of the Registrar is relatively limited.
('6', 506, 2, 15, 991213) Under the new Act, if accepted by Indians, the Registrar will practically become their master.
('6', 506, 2, 16, 991308) 17. Under the new Act, applying for registration is compulsory for every Indian.
('6', 506, 2, 17, 991389) Indians who are in a position to apply for themselves are very rare.
('6', 506, 2, 18, 991458) Permit agents have earned much but if the Indians submit to the new Act, those agents will have a fertile field opened up to them, money flowing into their hands like a swarm of serpents rushing out of a mound.
('6', 506, 2, 19, 991669) At the very least, therefore, assuming that there will be 10,000 Indian applicants, they will be robbed of  30,000, counting the fee at 3 per head on an average.
('6', 507, 0, 1, 991831) 508 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 507, 1, 2, 991873) 18. Anyone submitting to such an oppressive law and obtaining registers, or causing others to obtain them, will be shedding the blood of Indians by robbing them as above.
('6', 507, 1, 3, 992044) Is there any Indian who is not roused to fury by such a law?
('6', 507, 1, 4, 992105) We should very much like to know the Indian whose blood does not boil.
('6', 507, 1, 5, 992176) And it is incredible to us that any Indian may want to submit to such legislation.
('6', 507, 1, 6, 992259) This new Act is the extreme limit of slavery.
('6', 507, 1, 7, 992305) And it is our earnest hope that no Indian will accept it, whatever the benefit he may get thereby, but that everyone will resist it at all cost.
('6', 507, 1, 8, 992450) What Mr. Kallenbach 1 writes is quite true: that is, if we submit to such a law, we deserve it 2 Everyone will believe so.
('6', 507, 1, 9, 992573) It is to be borne in mind that this Act not only insults Indians but casts a slur on the religion of both Hindus and Muslims.
('6', 507, 1, 10, 992699) For, Hindus and Muslims who come from India are, as a matter of course, covered by it.
('6', 507, 1, 11, 992786) But even the Muslims of Turkey (which is considered a part of Europe) are brought within the mischief of the Act, as if the Transvaal Government will be in danger if Muslims not belonging to India are excluded.
('6', 507, 1, 12, 992997) Christians from that country are not touched.

('6', 507, 5, 16, 993108) The South Africa British Indian Committees communication to General Botha is very good and covers every point.
('6', 507, 5, 17, 993219) This Committee has done so much work and done it so well that we cannot thank Sir Muncherjee 3, Mr. Ritch 4 and other members well enough.
('6', 507, 5, 18, 993358) Wetherefore feel some hesitation in pointing out one mistake the Committee has made in the communication.
('6', 507, 5, 19, 993464) However, it is our duty to do so.
('6', 507, 5, 20, 993498) The mistake does not diminish the value of the Committee.
('6', 507, 5, 21, 993556) It only proves how every human being is liable to err.
('6', 507, 5, 22, 993611) The mistake consists in the

('6', 508, 1, 3, 994220) Though it has been left to the Indians whether or not to append the photograph, we hold that even the suggestion should not have been made by the Committee.
('6', 508, 1, 4, 994377) Moreover, the Committees communication makes it appear as though the giving of finger prints were the only or the greatest objection to the new law.
('6', 508, 1, 5, 994526) In fact, finger prints form but one of the objections.
('6', 508, 1, 6, 994581) The crucial point is the compulsory registration under the law, which casts a slur on the community and brands it as unworthy.
('6', 508, 1, 7, 994708) However, the mistake is not likely to do any harm.
('6', 508, 1, 8, 994759) No such mistake was made during the struggle against the Bill.
('6', 508, 1, 9, 994822) After the Bill has become law, the Committees suggestion is not likely to have any adverse effect.
('6', 508, 1, 10, 994921) For now the matter rests in the hands of the Indian community.
('6', 508, 1, 11, 994984) If the Indian community really disapproves of the law, it will not submit to it, no matter what calamities befall it; it will accept imprisonment for not submitting to it; and will feel happy doing so because its honour will have been preserved.
('6', 508, 1, 12, 995230) As Mr. Ritch says, some members may even leave the Com mittee, as Mr. Rees 1 did, on seeing the Indian community determined to disobey the law.
('6', 508, 1, 13, 995374) It is likely that such members will advise us to submit to disgrace.
('6', 508, 1, 14, 995443) Even so, we need not be afraid, for the Indian community holds it to be a virtue not to submit to the new law, and in doing a good deed we need not be afraid of anyone.
('6', 508, 1, 15, 995612) Knowing that God always protects the righteous, the Transvaal Indians should keep to the straight path they have chosen for themselves.

('6', 508, 5, 19, 995815) It appears to us that the condition of Indians in Cape Town is likely to be very bad in days to come.
('6', 508, 5, 20, 995917) We publish elsewhere in this issue a letter received from Mafeking and draw the attention of every Indian leader in Cape Town to it.
('6', 508, 5, 21, 996050) The worst clause in the Cape Town Act is to the effect that an Indian who leaves Cape Town without a pass cannot return to it.
('6', 508, 5, 22, 996177) Such a pass will be valid only for one year.

('6', 509, 1, 2, 996327) There are hundreds of Indians who know nothing about taking out a pass.
('6', 509, 1, 3, 996399) Even if a pass is taken out, it will not be possible for everyone to return with that pass within one year.
('6', 509, 1, 4, 996507) As a result of this Act, it is likely that within five years Indians will have left Cape Town, bag and baggage.
('6', 509, 1, 5, 996619) We earnestly hope that leading Indians in Cape Town will deeply ponder over this question and take suitable steps.

('6', 509, 5, 9, 996800) News has been received by cable that Mr. Karl Blind 1 is dead.
('6', 509, 5, 10, 996863) This gentleman was a famous German.
('6', 509, 5, 11, 996899) He was born in 1826. He suffered imprisonment five times, between 1847 and 1849, in the cause of freedom and for the rights of others.
('6', 509, 5, 12, 997034) In this way he had to suffer imprisonment for opposing his Government.
('6', 509, 5, 13, 997105) Once he was even sentenced to death for a public cause, but was saved.
('6', 509, 5, 14, 997176) Later, he again suffered imprisonment for eight years, but in the end people got him released through pressure.
('6', 509, 5, 15, 997288) This great man was a friend of Mazzini and Garibaldi 2. He helped Japan against Russia.
('6', 509, 5, 16, 997376) He was a very learned man.
('6', 509, 5, 17, 997403) He has written many historical works.
('6', 509, 5, 18, 997441) He was a lover of India.
('6', 509, 5, 19, 997466) Such scholars who, making other peoples sufferings their own, have served sentences of imprisonment and even faced the gallows provide a very useful example to us today.

('6', 509, 9, 23, 997708) Everyone can see that in India a great deal of wealth is being wasted.
('6', 509, 9, 24, 997779) This wealth includes many things.
('6', 509, 9, 25, 997813) None takes care of the minerals.
('6', 509, 9, 26, 997846) Our cotton is exported to foreign countries, and cloth is imported from there.
('6', 509, 9, 27, 997925) Even a pin has to be imported from abroad.

('6', 510, 1, 2, 998178) What happens to our material wealth seems to be happening to our human wealth also.
('6', 510, 1, 3, 998262) Many bavas and fakirs maintain themselves by begging, but serve neither themselves nor the country.
('6', 510, 1, 4, 998362) For going about begging in this manner, they will not be regarded as having attained true renunciation.
('6', 510, 1, 5, 998466) In the same way, thousands of widows, mostly among Hindus, spend their whole life to no purpose.
('6', 510, 1, 6, 998563) And to that extent the wealth of India is being wasted.
('6', 510, 1, 7, 998619) To prevent this waste, the benevolent Prof.
('6', 510, 1, 8, 998663) Karve 1 of Poona has dedicated his life to the country.
('6', 510, 1, 9, 998719) He has been working in the Fergusson College only on a living wage.
('6', 510, 1, 10, 998787) Not only that, but he has also been running for several years an institution in Poona for the education of widows.
('6', 510, 1, 11, 998902) There, women are given training in midwifery and nursing.
('6', 510, 1, 12, 998960) The work of the institution has been expanding.
('6', 510, 1, 13, 999008) Because he is rendering honorary service himself, he is able to get similar assistance from others too.
('6', 510, 1, 14, 999112) Mrs. Kashibai Deodhar, Mrs. Namjoshi, Mrs. Athavale and Mrs. Deshpandeall these ladies who have had very good English educa tion have been giving honorary service to the institution.
('6', 510, 1, 15, 999295) Moreover, he goes about from place to place collecting funds.
('6', 510, 1, 16, 999357) There are so many things which can be done through sheer self help and without Government aid.
('6', 510, 1, 17, 999452) From every point of view, education is the most important thing for us.

('6', 510, 6, 22, 999598) This law has not yet been published in the Gazette.
('6', 510, 6, 23, 999650) Meanwhile, cables received from England indicate that the Imperial Government is still considering the matter.
('6', 510, 6, 24, 999761) When Lord Ampthill 2 raised adiscussion in the House of Lords, Lord Lansdowne 3 said that wounding the susceptibilities of the whole Indian community would be more injurious and imprudent than the surreptitious entry of a few Indians

('6', 511, 1, 2, 1000324) into the country.
('6', 511, 1, 3, 1000342) In his reply, Lord Elgin 1 said that he [also] did not like to put his signature to the Act.
('6', 511, 1, 4, 1000435) The lesson of this is that Indians should not submit to the law.
('6', 511, 1, 5, 1000500) It will be a great humiliation to the Indian community if it submits to a law which has raised such a heated controversy and has been so much condemned.
('6', 511, 2, 6, 1000653) REPERCUSSIONS OF TRANSVAAL LAW
('6', 511, 3, 7, 1000684) It is not as if the effects of this law will be felt only here.
('6', 511, 3, 8, 1000748) Already, its repercussions have reached even German East Africa.
('6', 511, 3, 9, 1000813) The Germans there wish to take full advantage of the Indian trader, without however allowing him any benefit in return.
('6', 511, 3, 10, 1000933) Some Germans expressed the fear that the British Government might intervene if the Indian traders were harassed.
('6', 511, 3, 11, 1001046) A member of the German Parliament replied by asking how the British Government, which did not intervene in the case of the Transvaal, could do so in respect of the Germans.
('6', 511, 3, 12, 1001219) This too points to the self same lesson.
('6', 511, 3, 13, 1001260) As soon as the Indian community submits to the new law, it may be taken for granted that its foothold in all territories outside India will be lost.
('6', 511, 3, 14, 1001409) Thereafter, only those Indians will be able to reside in places outside India who will live on their labour?
('6', 511, 3, 15, 1001518) without any status.
('6', 511, 4, 16, 1001538) ADVICE OF PROMINENT WHITE
('6', 511, 5, 17, 1001564) I had a meeting with a prominent member of the Transvaal Parliament.
('6', 511, 5, 18, 1001633) On being asked about the gaol resolution, he immediately replied that if we went to prison, no further steps would be necessary.
('6', 511, 5, 19, 1001762) He had not expected that Indians would show so much courage and display such spirit for the sake of the community and for their honour.
('6', 511, 5, 20, 1001898) If we remained united and adhered to the gaol resolution, he promised to give us as much help as he could.
('6', 511, 5, 21, 1002005) Moreover, he added, the entire Liberal Party in England would come to our rescue and the new law would be repealed.
('6', 511, 5, 22, 1002121) He quoted Burke, the great English writer, who used to say that thousands of men could not be sent to the gallows, nor could they be kept confined behind prison bars.
('6', 511, 6, 23, 1002288) WHAT WHITE TRADER SAYS
('6', 511, 7, 24, 1002311) A white merchant took upon himself to give prudent advice and said that the Indian community should submit to the law.
('6', 511, 7, 25, 1002430) He was asked if he thought that others were happy because he himself lived in

('6', 512, 1, 2, 1002598) comfort and happiness as a result of the struggle that his ancestors had put up.
('6', 512, 1, 3, 1002679) He could not answer the question.
('6', 512, 1, 4, 1002713) In the end I asked him, in the presence of a big customer, Suppose your customer sacrifices hisall and goes to gaol for the sake of his community.
('6', 512, 1, 5, 1002860) Will he not, when he comes out, rise in your estimation?
('6', 512, 1, 6, 1002917) Will you not help him more liberally? To this he replied, Yes.
('6', 512, 1, 7, 1002980) Thats right.
('6', 512, 1, 8, 1002993) But do your people have so much courage? Ultimately, the thing comes to this: in the market the Indian cowrie is treated as a bad coin at present, and so the value of the Indian is the value of a bad coin.
('6', 512, 2, 9, 1003199) LETTER TO THE STAR
('6', 512, 3, 10, 1003218) As General Botha has returned and the Committee in England is still continuing its struggle against the law, Mr. Gandhi has addressed the following letter to The Star: 1
('6', 512, 4, 11, 1003388) The arrival of General Botha and the fact that the Asiatic Registration Act is still the subject matter of correspondence between the Imperial Government and the local Government, encourage me to appeal once more to your good sense and, through you, to that of the Colonists.
('6', 512, 4, 12, 1003664) Now that the anti Asiatic party has obtained what it wanted, is it impossible to arrive at a reasonable compromise and to do away with a law under which Indians will be treated as criminals?
('6', 512, 4, 13, 1003855) The Act is not yet gazetted, and it need not be.
('6', 512, 4, 14, 1003904) I, therefore, suggest that a form for new permits may be mutually agreed upon, and, in accordance with it, Indians and other Asiatics may be registered afresh in exchange for proper documents they may posses.
('6', 512, 4, 15, 1004113) If, then, all Asiatics thus voluntarily surrender their documents, there can be no occasion for submitting them to any degradation.
('6', 512, 4, 16, 1004245) If, however, there are Asiatics in the Colony who do not surrender their documents, the Act can be immediately gazetted, and be made applicable, by a short Bill, to them.
('6', 512, 4, 17, 1004416) Thus, those who are bona fide holders of permits and are honest will be automatically separated from those who are guilty.
('6', 512, 5, 18, 1004539) I do not know whether you can see any flaw in this proposal, unless you think that the object of the legislation is not that illicit traffic in permits may be stopped, but that it is to, openly and boldly, put an unwarranted affront upon British Indians and other Asiatics.
('6', 512, 5, 19, 1004813) Let me remind you, before any such declaration is made, of Lord Ampthills remarks:
('6', 512, 6, 20, 1004896) This is not a matter which only touches our honour.
('6', 512, 6, 21, 1004948) We are pledged to our fellow citizens in Indiapledged by the solemn declaration of the Sovereign, by the pronouncements of our statesmen, and by all that is implied in the

('6', 513, 0, 1, 1005265) 514 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 513, 1, 2, 1005307) whole method of our administration of that great dominionto treat the people of India as fellow citizens in every sense of the word.
('6', 513, 1, 3, 1005440) We invite them to be proud of their citizenship of the Empire.
('6', 513, 1, 4, 1005503) We tell them, again and again, that there is nothing to prevent their rising to the same positions as are held by Englishmen in India, and we imply, in all that we do for them and say to them, that wherever they are under the British flag in any part of the world, they will be treated as British citizens.
('6', 513, 2, 5, 1005810) Lord Lansdowne feels so keenly humiliated by this Act, that he questions whether to wound the susceptibilities of the whole Indian nation is not a more important matter than the conditions in the Transvaal.
('6', 513, 2, 6, 1006017) But the proposal I have ventured to sketch above is just as effective against surreptitious entry as may be by the Asiatic Act.
('6', 513, 3, 7, 1006145) If the Government does not accept the suggestion made in this letter, it would obviously mean that the new law had no other aim than that of humiliating the Indian community.
('6', 513, 3, 8, 1006320) Then the fable of the wolf and the lamb would apply.
('6', 513, 3, 9, 1006373) The wolf is bent on killing the lamb anyhow.
('6', 513, 4, 10, 1006418) KALLENBACHS HELP
('6', 513, 5, 11, 1006435) Mr. Kallenbach is a well known architect of Johannesburg.
('6', 513, 5, 12, 1006493) He has written the following letter to The Star in order to sustain the spirit of the Indian community and encourage it in its gaol going resolve.
('6', 513, 5, 13, 1006640) This letter is also published along with Mr. Gandhis: 1
('6', 513, 6, 14, 1006696) Although, for some reasons, I am not taking part in political matters, I have been following with interest the various stages of action among the Transvaal Indians in their struggle to defend their legitimate rights by that gaol resolution.
('6', 513, 7, 15, 1006937) I have read the various Press comments on the latter question, and also Mr. Gandhis letter to The Star, in all of which the gaol resolution was discussed.
('6', 513, 7, 16, 1007092) I for one am of the opinion that the Asiatic Registration Ordinance imposes certain conditions which are degrading to any man of self respect, and if this was not keenly felt by Asiatics, it would be a clear proof that they fully deserve the Registration Act.
('6', 513, 7, 17, 1007352) I think it most unfair to call those men, who are working in order to show to their countrymen the deep humiliation which the new legislation tries to impose upon them, aggressive agitators.
('6', 513, 7, 18, 1007543) I believe it to be the duty of those Indians, who are able to grasp the conditions

('6', 514, 1, 2, 1007778) of the new legislation, to impart this knowledge to every one of their countrymen and to do their utmost to so raise and strengthen their self respect that by united action those humiliating conditions are changed.
('6', 514, 1, 3, 1007993) I feel sure that the fear of the Indian storekeepers competition has not deadened every white mans sense of justice, and that many of themand I hope that their number is not smallcannot do otherwise than show their admiration and full sympathy for men who, rather than submit to humiliating legislative conditions, go to gaol, setting aside, in addition to the hardships of prison life which they are prepared to face, monetary losses too.
('6', 514, 2, 4, 1008433) I have never overlooked the very keen competition existing between the various races, but I have found that it has been exaggerated on the European side.
('6', 514, 2, 5, 1008587) The suggestions and propositions made by the British Indian Association of Johannesburg appeared to me very reasonable and fair, and I feel certain that fuller knowledge of the Indian question in the Transvaal, by those men responsible for and dealing with the same, would have prevented the present acute state of affairs
('6', 514, 3, 6, 1008910) In conclusion, I wish to say that I shall consider it a privilege to visit my Indian friends in the gaol and to do my utmost to redress the hardships of prison life which they are prepared to undergo....
('6', 514, 4, 7, 1009114) Mr. Kallenbach deserves compliments for having written such a noble letter.
('6', 514, 4, 8, 1009190) It would not be surprising if more whites like him came forward.
('6', 514, 4, 9, 1009255) If already men like Mr. Kallenbach have come forward to express their sympathy even though we have nothing to show by way of action, many more will do so when we actually do something.
('6', 514, 5, 10, 1009440) MEETING OF ASSOCIATION
('6', 514, 6, 11, 1009463) At 4.30 p.m.
('6', 514, 6, 12, 1009476) on Saturday, a meeting of the Association took place to consider the question of a deputation to General Botha.
('6', 514, 6, 13, 1009588) Those present included the acting Chairman, Mr. Essop Mia, Messrs Abdool Gani 1, Coovadia, Naidoo, Omarji Sale, Alibhai Akuji, Pillay, Mahomed, Emam Abdool Cadir and other gentlemen.
('6', 514, 6, 14, 1009771) Mr. Hajee Habib 2 had come from Pretoria specially to attend this meeting.
('6', 514, 6, 15, 1009846) After certain points had been decided, it was resolved to send a deputation to General Botha, Mr. Hajee Habib moving and Mr. Coovadia seconding the resolution.
('6', 514, 6, 16, 1010006) It was also decided to submit a petition requesting the Government to accept the proposal contained in Mr.
('6', 514, 7, 17, 1010113) 1 Chairman, British Indian Association, 1903 7. 2 Secretary, Pretoria Committee of the British Indian Association.
('6', 515, 0, 1, 1010228) 516 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 515, 1, 2, 1010270) Gandhis letter to The Star referred to above, and that General Botha should be informed that, if that proposal was turned down by the Government and the desired changes were not made in the law, the Indian community would never accept the law and would adhere to the September Resolution.
('6', 515, 1, 3, 1010559) It was resolved that the deputation should consist of Messrs Essop Mia, Abdool Gani, Hajee Habib, Moonlight, and Gandhi.
('6', 515, 1, 4, 1010680) Accordingly, Mr. Essop Mia has asked General Botha for an appointment.
('6', 515, 1, 5, 1010751) 1 By the time this letter is published in Indian Opinion, the deputation may have already waited upon General Botha.
('6', 515, 2, 6, 1010868) WHAT CAN GOVERNMENT DO BUT IMPRISON US?
('6', 515, 3, 7, 1010908) It has been suggested that the Government may not prosecute any Indian for not taking out the new registers, but quietly wait till the end of the year when Indians will have to close down their businesses, since their trading licences will not be renewed.
('6', 515, 3, 8, 1011164) It is improbable that this will happen.
('6', 515, 3, 9, 1011204) For, in that case, the hundreds of Indians who hold no trading licences will never come within the sweep of the law.
('6', 515, 3, 10, 1011321) The employees of a trader will escape penalty.
('6', 515, 3, 11, 1011368) Adopting that course will render the law as good as non existent.
('6', 515, 3, 12, 1011434) But supposing that the Governments intention is only to harass merchants, I have already given the reply that once we have discarded the fear of imprisonment, there is nothing for us to be afraid of.
('6', 515, 3, 13, 1011634) The Government itself will stand to lose if it does not grant licences.
('6', 515, 3, 14, 1011706) For, the merchant can carry on his trade without a licence.
('6', 515, 3, 15, 1011766) The risk in doing so will be just the same as the risk in not taking out the new register.
('6', 515, 3, 16, 1011857) If the new registeris not taken out, at the most one has to go to gaol.
('6', 515, 3, 17, 1011929) In the same way, for trading without a licence one may have to go to gaol.
('6', 515, 3, 18, 1012004) The only difference will be that only one man will be punished for trading without a licence, with the result that the shop can remain open and the employees can work in it.
('6', 515, 3, 19, 1012178) On the other hand, for not holding the new register everyone can be arrested.
('6', 515, 4, 20, 1012256) CAN GOODS OF MERCHANT TRADING WITHOUT LICENCE BE AUCTIONED?
('6', 515, 5, 21, 1012316) This question also has been raised.
('6', 515, 5, 22, 1012352) According to the Natal law the goods can be auctioned.
('6', 515, 5, 23, 1012407) But in the Transvaal, in case of non

('6', 516, 1, 2, 1012588) payment of fine the defaulter has to go to gaol.
('6', 516, 1, 3, 1012637) Fine is not to be paid by anyone.
('6', 516, 1, 4, 1012671) If therefore the Government should want to exercise pressure on us through the trade licence, all shopkeepers and hawkers will start trading without a licence.
('6', 516, 2, 5, 1012831) CAN SHOPS BE CLOSED DOWN?
('6', 516, 3, 6, 1012857) It has been asked whether the Government can close down the shop of anyone trading without a licence.
('6', 516, 3, 7, 1012959) Nowhere in South Africa is there a law providing for the forcible closure of a shop.
('6', 516, 3, 8, 1013044) There is therefore no such danger.
('6', 516, 4, 9, 1013079) WHAT CHANGES CAN BE MADE THROUGH REGULATIONS?
('6', 516, 5, 10, 1013125) There has been an inquiry as to whether it will be possible for General Botha to give us relief in the regulations, and whether it will still be necessary for us to resist the law if we get all the relief asked for.
('6', 516, 5, 11, 1013341) In the first place, it is.
('6', 516, 5, 12, 1013368) essential to know what can be secured through regulations.
('6', 516, 5, 13, 1013427) These can only determine whether a thumb impression or digit impressions will be required or whether signatures will be enough.
('6', 516, 5, 14, 1013555) But such matters as registration of children,harassment by the police, showing of identification marks to the police, etc., which are the oppressive sections in this Act, cannot be changed by regulations.
('6', 516, 5, 15, 1013760) In brief, the slur that the law casts on us cannot be wiped out by regulations framed under it.
('6', 516, 5, 16, 1013856) Without amending the law therefore General Botha cannot give us the redress we seek.
('6', 516, 5, 17, 1013941) It is absolutely futile to hope that the law will be amended.
('6', 516, 5, 18, 1014003) The utmost that can be done is not to have the law gazetted for the present.
('6', 516, 5, 19, 1014080) By this the prestige of both parties will be maintained.
('6', 516, 5, 20, 1014137) If the law is so amended as to make it acceptable to us, the Government will lose face.
('6', 516, 6, 21, 1014225) FREE INDIANS WORSE THAN DOGS
('6', 516, 7, 22, 1014254) A huge agricultural exhibition is being held here just now.
('6', 516, 7, 23, 1014314) The Exhibition Committee has framed a regulation to the effect that free Asiatics or Natives who are not employees of whites cannot visit the exhibition.
('6', 516, 7, 24, 1014468) However, dogs are free to enter, and, what is more, good pedigree dogs are awarded prizes!
('6', 516, 7, 25, 1014559) In the opinion of this white Committee, a free Indian is worse than these dogs.
('6', 516, 8, 26, 1014639) PERMIT OFFICE
('6', 516, 9, 27, 1014653) A case appears to have just occurred which shows that we did very well in having boycotted the Permit Office.
('6', 516, 9, 28, 1014763) An Indian had
('6', 517, 0, 1, 1014777) 518 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('6', 517, 1, 2, 1014819) received a notice saying that a permit would be issued to him.
('6', 517, 1, 3, 1014882) He had only to go to the Office and receive it He was therefore advised that he might accept the permit if no mention of the new law was made.
('6', 517, 1, 4, 1015025) Accordingly, he went to the Permit Office.
('6', 517, 1, 5, 1015068) However, Mr. Chamney told him that the permit would be issued to him only if he gave an assurance that he would submit to the new law.
('6', 517, 1, 6, 1015203) The brave Indian refused to comply and left the Office without the permit.
('6', 517, 1, 7, 1015278) Every Indian should understand that the Permit Office is a trap for Indians.
('6', 517, 2, 8, 1015355) WHAT INDIAN TRADERS CAN DO
('6', 517, 3, 9, 1015382) Many Indian traders say that the Dutchmen are ready to send a petition to the Government stating that they are not against us.
('6', 517, 3, 10, 1015509) If this is the case, it is necessary for every Indian trader to obtain signatures of Dutchmen on such a petition.
('6', 517, 3, 11, 1015623) It is not necessary to make much fuss in the matter.
('6', 517, 3, 12, 1015676) If the traders wish to take it up, petition forms will be sent to them.
('6', 517, 3, 13, 1015748) Those in a position to obtain signatures should write to the Association.
('6', 517, 4, 14, 1015822) REGULATIONS FOR HAWKERS
('6', 517, 5, 15, 1015846) The Government has returned [to the Town Council] the regula tions for hawkers, saying that the licence fee of 5 may be reduced to 3. The Council Committee has sent a reply stating that the rate of 5 should be retained, as a reduction would result in financial loss.
('6', 517, 6, 16, 1016113) PERMIT CASE
('6', 517, 7, 17, 1016125) Permit cases have been going on for some time.
('6', 517, 7, 18, 1016172) Two washermen were accused of using false permits and of staying without permits.
('6', 517, 7, 19, 1016254) In their defence, they stated that an Indian had taken them to Johannes burg, telling them that the Permit Officer visited the town and issued permit.
('6', 517, 7, 20, 1016405) The said Indian demanded from each of the washermen 30, which they agreed to pay.
('6', 517, 7, 21, 1016487) They went to the place of the Indian where they saw a disguised European.
('6', 517, 7, 22, 1016561) He gave them permits and they each paid 30. They were acquitted of the charge of having used false permits as they were not aware that the permits given by the European were false.
('6', 517, 7, 23, 1016742) But on the charge of having resided without a permit, they have been ordered to leave the Transvaal within seven days.
('6', 517, 7, 24, 1016861) It will be interesting to know who this officer may be, for there are various rumours current in the town.
('6', 517, 7, 25, 1016968) A similar charge was brought against another Indian.
('6', 518, 0, 1, 1017021) VOL. 6: 5 NOVEMBER, 1906 12 JUNE, 1907 519
('6', 518, 1, 2, 1017064) based on the affidavit of some Indian.
('6', 518, 1, 3, 1017103) In deposing before the magistrate, the Indian who had made the affidavit turned hostile to theprosecution.
('6', 518, 1, 4, 1017210) Thereupon the magistrate discharged the accused and sentenced the other Indian for giving false evidence.
('6', 518, 1, 5, 1017316) The case of this gentleman appears to prove the truth of the saying, He who digs a pit will I himself fall into it.

('6', 518, 4, 8, 1017473) 415. CONDITION OF MUSLIMS IN AFGHANISTAN
('6', 518, 5, 9, 1017514) We published some time ago an article by Mr. Saiyed Ali, B.A., on Muslim administration.
('6', 518, 5, 10, 1017603) The second part of that article appeared in the Indian Review of March which we briefly summarize below.
('6', 518, 5, 11, 1017708) We have considered Turkey and Iran.
('6', 518, 5, 12, 1017744) Let us now turn to Afghanistan, which has made big advances recently.
('6', 518, 5, 13, 1017814) It can safely be stated that before Amir Abdur Rahman ascended the throne, there was hardly any administration in Afghanistan, though, even then, there were councils called Ulu and Malik.
('6', 518, 5, 14, 1018002) Residents of the various localities in a village sent representatives to a council known as Khel, and the Ulu was elected from out of them.
('6', 518, 5, 15, 1018142) But in those times, owing to the difficult temper of the people, no one could maintain control over the administration.
('6', 518, 5, 16, 1018262) Then thieves had their arms cut off.
('6', 518, 5, 17, 1018299) If a slave tried to run away, he had his legs chopped off.
('6', 518, 5, 18, 1018358) The different provinces were governed by local chieftains and Sardars.
('6', 518, 5, 19, 1018429) Above the Sardars there were Amirs, but the Sardars showed little respect for their authority.
('6', 518, 5, 20, 1018524) The Pathan is by nature an adventurous individual, and so he was quite at home with such unsettled conditions.
('6', 518, 5, 21, 1018635) In those times, punishments such as those described above were the only effective ones.
('6', 518, 5, 22, 1018723) Once a Pathan told General Elphinstone 1 in reply to a question: We are content to remain quarrelling; we are not afraid of dangers, and do not grow pale at the sight of blood.
('6', 518, 5, 23, 1018900) Come what may, we will not give up our freedom and submit ourselves to any Emperor. After coming to the throne, Amir Abdur Rahman introduced important changes.
('6', 518, 5, 24, 1019060) He took the utmost advantage of the fact that his kingdom was a buffer State between Russia and England.
('6', 518, 5, 25, 1019165) Sometimes

('6', 519, 1, 2, 1019297) he would lean towards Russia and sometimes towards England.
('6', 519, 1, 3, 1019357) He would not quarrel openly with either, and in the end, would side with England.
('6', 519, 1, 4, 1019439) This shrewdness of his won the admiration of European statesmen.
('6', 519, 1, 5, 1019504) He always had things to his advantage, but yielded nothing to others in return.
('6', 519, 1, 6, 1019584) In the internal affairs of the kingdom, too, he showed the highest ability, and broke the power of the local chieftains.
('6', 519, 1, 7, 1019705) He reformed the civil law.
('6', 519, 1, 8, 1019732) The annual tribute of twelve lakhs of rupees which he used to receive from the Government of India, later raised to eighteen lakhs, was put to wise use.
('6', 519, 1, 9, 1019885) He formed an army, stocke dammunition and expanded trade.
('6', 519, 1, 10, 1019943) Unnecessary faxes were removed, and a mint was established.
('6', 519, 1, 11, 1020003) The present ruler has raised the status of Afghanistan even further.
('6', 519, 1, 12, 1020072) He has established two councils, named Darbar e Shahi and Kwajan Shahi.
('6', 519, 1, 13, 1020144) Under such a political system even the temper of the Pathans has begun to change.
('6', 519, 1, 14, 1020226) If the present trend continues for long, the warlike Pathan will have established a strong kingdom in the East.
('6', 519, 1, 15, 1020338) All the same, it must be admitted that the people of Afghanistan do not interest themselves in political affairs.
('6', 519, 1, 16, 1020452) Amir Habibullah Khan is an Emperor.
('6', 519, 1, 17, 1020488) He is a brave soldier and a pious man.
('6', 519, 1, 18, 1020527) His Majesty never missed his prayers while in India.
('6', 519, 1, 19, 1020580) We cannot say for certain whether or not he will observe the agreement of 1905. The Amir is now accorded the status of an Emperor and receives a salute of thirty one guns.
('6', 519, 1, 20, 1020752) He now enjoys the same power that the Shah of Iran does.

('6', 519, 5, 24, 1020922) TO THE EDITOR THE STAR [JOHANNESBURG]
('6', 519, 6, 25, 1020960) SIR, I have seen the Gazette notice today intimating that the Asiatic Law Amendment Act has received the Royal sanction, and that it will
('6', 519, 7, 26, 1021098) 1 Presumably, this was drafted by Gandhiji.
('6', 519, 7, 27, 1021142) It was reproduced in India Opinion 15 6 1907.

('6', 520, 1, 2, 1021231) come into force on a day to be appointed.
('6', 520, 1, 3, 1021273) I do not know what this means, but it leaves breathing space, and I, therefore, wish to place before the public a mercantile view of the Act.
('6', 520, 1, 4, 1021415) In order to do that, I am obliged to enter into a bit of autobiography.
('6', 520, 1, 5, 1021487) I have been settled in the Transvaal for the last 19 years, and have the honour to represent, as managing partner, the firm of Suliman Ismail Mia and Co.
('6', 520, 1, 6, 1021641) My firm has very large dealings with European wholesale houses, who have need I say, derived very considerable pecuniary profit from their transactions with the firm.
('6', 520, 1, 7, 1021808) It suffered severe reverses during the Jameson Raid 1, and yet its creditors were paid in full.
('6', 520, 1, 8, 1021904) It underwent asimilar ordeal during the Boer War; the creditors were still paid in full.
('6', 520, 1, 9, 1021993) And now, for the third time,complete ruin stares it in the face.
('6', 520, 1, 10, 1022058) In the two previous instances, the cause was beyond human, at any rate my firms, control.
('6', 520, 1, 11, 1022148) Today, the cause will be of its own seeking, and why?
('6', 520, 1, 12, 1022202) For the simple reason that the Asiatic Law Amendment Act is considered by every Indian who has understood it as a mark of slavery pure and simple.
('6', 520, 1, 13, 1022349) It makes of the Transvaal a prison house for every Indian, so far as I know my countrymens mind.
('6', 520, 1, 14, 1022446) They have, therefore, decided not to submit to such an Act, but to suffer the consequence of such disobedience.
('6', 520, 1, 15, 1022558) It goes against the grain for an Indian to disobey any law, and yet the feeling aroused by this Act is so strong that disobedience is deemed a virtue and obedience a cowardly vice.
('6', 520, 1, 16, 1022739) The position that I, as an Indian merchant, am placed in is the position occupied by many like myself.
('6', 520, 1, 17, 1022842) Do you suppose that all such Indians do not realize the full force and effect of what they stand to lose from a worldly standpoint by disobeying the law?
('6', 520, 1, 18, 1022996) But we have learned at the feet of your countrymen that it is better to suffer such loss than to surrender personal freedom and accept humiliation.
('6', 520, 1, 19, 1023144) Why should I accept cancellation of my title deeds, and have to go to the Permit Office, hat in hand, and beg for a new title deed with many restrictions?
('6', 520, 1, 20, 1023299) Moreover, as a Mahomedan, I resent most bitterly that, whereas non Mahomedan subjects of the Turkish Empire are free from the galling yoke of the Act, Mahomedan subjects of that Empire are not.
('6', 520, 1, 21, 1023493) These are facts which I venture to ask you and the public to weigh well.
('6', 520, 2, 22, 1023566) I should not have troubled you were it not for the fact that the Government have reserved to themselves yet the right to retire from what is, from the Indian standpoint, a false position.

('6', 521, 1, 3, 1023984) It is true that, under the voluntary offer, there will be no ear marking of Indian babes, but I must frankly confess that no loss of the good things of this world will deter me from disobeying an Act which means that I shall have to supply identification particulars of a day old son of mine, and be subject to the tacit assumption that the infant is a future criminal of the direst type.
('6', 521, 1, 4, 1024373) I have spoken to many European friends of mine.
('6', 521, 1, 5, 1024421) They all consider that our offer is very reasonable.
('6', 521, 1, 6, 1024474) I ask you, and them, to support us in our struggle for a respectable existence in the Transvaal.
('6', 521, 1, 7, 1024571) Jesus is as much a prophet of the Mahomedans as he is of the Christians.

('6', 521, 9, 16, 1025178) In view, however, of the fact that the date of enforcing the Act has not yet been gazetted, my Association once more approaches the Government and respectfully suggests that the offer of voluntary re registration may be accepted and that the Act may afterwards, by a short Bill, be made applicable to those who do not abide by the

('6', 522, 3, 5, 1025842) JOHANNESBURG, June 12, 1907
('6', 522, 4, 6, 1025870) MY DEAR CHHAGANLAL 1, We shall not be able to get anything extra from the Montague Estate for the addition made by them.
('6', 522, 4, 7, 1025991) I am glad that difficulties act as a spur to further action and further activity.
('6', 522, 4, 8, 1026073) That, undoubtedly, is the proper meaning to give to them.
('6', 522, 4, 9, 1026131) For such people there is no holding back and no disappoint ment.
('6', 522, 4, 10, 1026196) You have reproduced the common saying that thosewho act according to the dictates of duty must succeed, and so they do.
('6', 522, 4, 11, 1026316) Only, we must guard against misinterpreting the word success.
('6', 522, 4, 12, 1026378) Whereas many things that are not religion falsely pass as such, many things that we consider to be failures may, in reality, be successes.
('6', 522, 4, 13, 1026517) Whilst, therefore, we may accept the truth of the axiom, the eye should always be directed towards the work to be done, never to the result.
('6', 522, 4, 14, 1026658) You may, so far as I am concerned, print Tamil, Hindi and Urdu translations of the Act 2 in Indian Opinion, and let me have separate leaflets also.
('6', 522, 4, 15, 1026806) The more of these we circulate, the better it will be.
('6', 522, 4, 16, 1026861) The Act furnishes its own condemnation, and such has been also the effect, I notice, on the people here.
('6', 522, 4, 17, 1026966) There are very few copies now left of the current issue, although you sent me 350. Vyas sent for 60 copies for Pretoria, and I have orders today from up country for 15 copies.
('6', 522, 4, 18, 1027142) I have absolutely no reply with reference to the Gujarati type.
('6', 522, 4, 19, 1027206) Gokaldas 3 wrote me saying that he would attend, but he has disappointed me in almost every respect.
('6', 522, 4, 20, 1027307) He has become lazy, indifferent and superstitious.

K. Gandhi and H. O. Ally and to request that Your Excellency will be pleased to transmit same to His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies on which subject a petition signed by many British Indians has already been sent by Dr. William Godfrey.

('6', 524, 8, 7, 1028855) We notice in your issue of yesterday's date a report to the effect that Mr. Churchill said that the names of the two Indians who petitioned Lord Elgin disclaiming Messrs Gandhi and Ally as their representatives in England to protest against the Asiatic Law Amendment Ordinance were Dr. William Godfrey and Mr. C. M. Pillay.
('6', 524, 8, 8, 1029179) As our names are already being confounded with that of our brother, we wish to state that we entirely disassociate ourselves from his views, his petition and the attitude he has taken up.
('6', 524, 8, 9, 1029367) We repeat again our strong protest against the Asiatic Law Amendment Ordinance of the Transvaal which petition was sent to the Right Hon'ble the Earl of Elgin, His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies, on the 3rd November.
('6', 524, 8, 10, 1029609) We entirely agree with Messrs Gandhi and Ally's protest in this connection and heartily co operate with them in the work they are doing.
('6', 524, 8, 11, 1029746) The line of conduct adopted by our brother is inexplicable, as we always saw him to be an enthusiastic champion of our countrymen's cause in South Africa.
('6', 524, 8, 12, 1029901) The petition misrepresents Mr. Gandhi as a political agitator.
('6', 524, 8, 13, 1029964) We have had the pleasure of being associated with him and the Indian work for at least 15 years and from this intimate knowledge of things, we can take the responsibility of saying that his is purely a labour of love and not a means to a selfish end.
