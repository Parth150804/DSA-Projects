('53', 0, 1, 2, 42) 1. SUPERSTITIONS DIE HARD
('53', 0, 2, 3, 68) Mr. Henry Eaton writes from California: 1
('53', 0, 3, 4, 110) This letter betrays two superstitions.
('53', 0, 3, 5, 149) One of them is that India is unfit to govern herself because she cannot defend herself and is torn with internal dissensions.
('53', 0, 3, 6, 275) The writer gratuitously assumes that if Britain withdraws Russia is ready to pounce upon India.
('53', 0, 3, 7, 371) This is an insult to Russia.
('53', 0, 3, 8, 400) Is Russias one business to rule over those peoples who are not ruled by Britain?
('53', 0, 3, 9, 481) And if Russia has such nefarious designs upon India, does not the writer see that the same power that will oust the British from domination is bound to prevent any other domination?
('53', 0, 3, 10, 663) If the control is handed to Indias representatives by agreement, there must be some condition whereby Britain will guarantee protection from foreign aggression as a penance for her conscious or unconscious neglect during all these past years to fit India for defending herself.
('53', 0, 3, 11, 941) Personally, even under agreement, I should rely more upon the capacity of the nation to offer civil resistance to any aggressor as it did last year with partial success in the case of the British occupier.
('53', 0, 3, 12, 1147) Complete success awaits complete assimilation of non violence in thought, word and deed by the nation.
('53', 0, 3, 13, 1250) An ocular demonstration of the success of nationwide satyagraha must be a prelude to its worldwide acceptance and hence as a natural corollary to the admission of the futility of armament.
('53', 0, 3, 14, 1439) The only antidote to armament which is the visible symbol of violence is satyagraha the visible symbol of non violence.
('53', 0, 3, 15, 1559) But the writer is oppressed also by the fear of our dis sensions.
('53', 0, 3, 16, 1625) In the first place they are grossly exaggerated in transmis sion to the West.
('53', 0, 3, 17, 1703) In the second place, they are hardened during foreign control.
('53', 0, 3, 18, 1766) Imperial rule means divide et impera.
('53', 0, 3, 19, 1804) They must therefore melt with the withdrawal of the frigid foreign rule and the introduction of the warmth giving sunshine of real freedom.
('53', 0, 3, 20, 1944) The second superstition is harder still.
('53', 0, 3, 21, 1985) I mean that about the spinning wheel.
('53', 0, 3, 22, 2023) This is shared by some even in India.
('53', 0, 3, 23, 2061) The writer begs the question when he calls the method of machinery enlightened and that of the hand ignorant.
('53', 0, 3, 24, 2171) It has still to be proved that displacement of the hand by the machine is a blessing in every case.
('53', 0, 3, 25, 2271) Nor is it true that
('53', 0, 4, 26, 2291) 1 The letter is not reproduced here.
('53', 1, 0, 1, 2328) 2 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 1, 1, 2, 2368) that which is easy is better than that which is hard.
('53', 1, 1, 3, 2422) It is still less proved that every change is a blessing or that everything old is fit only to be discarded.
('53', 1, 1, 4, 2530) I hold that the machinery method is harmful when the same thing can be done easily by millions of hands not otherwise occupied.
('53', 1, 1, 5, 2658) It is any day better and safer for the millions spread in the seven hundred thousand villages of India scattered over an area nineteen hundred miles long and fifteen hundred broad that they manufacture their clothing in their own villages even as they prepare their own food.
('53', 1, 1, 6, 2934) These villages cannot retain the freedom they have enjoyed from time immemorial, if they do not control the production of prime necessaries of life.
('53', 1, 1, 7, 3083) Western observers hastily argue from Western conditions that what may be true of them must be true of India where conditions are different in so many material respects.
('53', 1, 1, 8, 3252) Applications of the laws of economics must vary with varying conditions.
('53', 1, 1, 9, 3325) The machinery method is no doubt easy.
('53', 1, 1, 10, 3364) But it is not necessarily a blessing on that account.
('53', 1, 1, 11, 3418) The descent to a certain place is easy but dangerous.
('53', 1, 1, 12, 3472) The method of the hand is a blessing, in the present case at any rate, because it is hard.
('53', 1, 1, 13, 3563) If the craze for the machinery method continues, it is highly likely that a time will come when we shall be so incapacitated and weak that we shall begin to curse ourselves for having forgotten the use of the living machines given to us by God.
('53', 1, 1, 14, 3808) Millions cannot keep themselves fit by games and athletics.
('53', 1, 1, 15, 3868) And why should they exchange the useful, productive, hardy occupations for the useless, unproductive and expensive games and exercises?
('53', 1, 1, 16, 4004) They are all right today for a change and recreation.
('53', 1, 1, 17, 4058) They will jar upon us when they become a necessary occupation in order that we may have the appetite for eating the food in the production of which we had no hand or part.
('53', 1, 1, 18, 4230) Lastly, I do not subscribe to the belief that everything old is bad.
('53', 1, 1, 19, 4299) Truth is old and difficult.
('53', 1, 1, 20, 4327) Untruth has many attractions.
('53', 1, 1, 21, 4357) But I would gladly go back to the very old Golden Age of Truth.
('53', 1, 1, 22, 4421) Good old brown bread is any day superior to the pasty white bread which has lost much of its nutritive value in going through the various processes of refinement.
('53', 1, 1, 23, 4584) The list of old and yet good things can be endlessly multiplied.
('53', 1, 1, 24, 4649) The spinning wheel is one such thing, at any rate, for India.
('53', 1, 1, 25, 4711) When India becomes self supporting, self reliant and proof against temptations and exploitation, she will cease to be the object of
('53', 2, 0, 1, 4843) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 3
('53', 2, 1, 2, 4885) greedy attraction for any power in the West or the East and will then feel secure without having to carry the burden of expensive armament.
('53', 2, 1, 3, 5025) Her internal economy will be Indias strongest bulwark against aggression.
('53', 2, 1, 4, 5099) Young India, 2 7 1931
('53', 2, 2, 5, 5121) 2. POWER NOT AN END
('53', 2, 3, 6, 5141) Satyamurti writes: 1
('53', 2, 4, 7, 5162) I write to you about the article Substance Not Shadow by you, in the Young India, of the 18th June.
('53', 2, 4, 8, 5262) The first sentence which causes me some doubt and anxiety is, My proposition therefore before the Working Committee was that agreed settlement failing, the Congress should give up the hope of winning a swaraj constitution by the way of the present Round Table Conference and should wait till all the communities were satisfied to adopt a purely national solution. Does this not mean a charter for extreme communalists to go on obstructing?
('53', 2, 5, 9, 5702) But the sentence which causes me grave anxiety is that which ends as follows: We can gain our end without political power and by directly acting upon the powers that be. I would add the following sentences also from your article in order to make my doubts clear to you.
('53', 2, 5, 10, 5972) One form of direct action is adult suffrage.
('53', 2, 5, 11, 6017) The second and more potent form is satyagraha.
('53', 2, 5, 12, 6064) It can easily be shown that whatever is needful and can be gained by political power can perhaps be more quickly and more certainly gained by satyagraha. I venture to join issue with you.
('53', 2, 5, 13, 6252) I was always and am today under the impression that what the Congress wants is political power more than anything else.
('53', 2, 5, 14, 6372) And, concretely speaking, prohibition can be more easily brought about by State action than by peaceful picketing.
('53', 2, 5, 15, 6487) Khaddar and swadeshi cloth can be spread better and more quickly by State action than by peaceful picketing, and the necessary reforms embodied in the Karachi resolution on Fundamental Rights can be enforced only by a swaraj Government.
('53', 2, 6, 16, 6724) In any case, I do not see why the nation should not concentrate all its energies today, upon the gaining of political power.
('53', 2, 7, 17, 6849) To me, politieal power is the substance, and all other reforms can and ought to wait.
('53', 2, 7, 18, 6935) I am thankful for this letter.
('53', 2, 7, 19, 6966) It enables me more clearly than I have been able to explain my position.
('53', 2, 7, 20, 7039) My implicit faith in non violence does mean yielding to minorities when they are really weak.
('53', 2, 7, 21, 7133) The best way to weaken
('53', 2, 8, 22, 7156) 1 Only extracts are reproduced here.
('53', 3, 0, 1, 7193) 4 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 3, 1, 2, 7233) communalists is to yield to them.
('53', 3, 1, 3, 7267) Resistance will only rouse their suspicion and strengthen their opposition.
('53', 3, 1, 4, 7343) A satyagrahi resists when there is threat of force behind obstruction.
('53', 3, 1, 5, 7414) I know that I do not carry the Congressmen in general with me in this what to me appears as very sensible and practical point of view.
('53', 3, 1, 6, 7549) But if we are to come to swaraj through non violent means, I know that this point of view will be accepted.
('53', 3, 1, 7, 7657) Now for Sjt.
('53', 3, 1, 8, 7670) Satyamurtis second difficulty.
('53', 3, 1, 9, 7701) To me political power is not an end but one of the means of enabling people to better their condition in every department of life.
('53', 3, 1, 10, 7832) Political power means capacity to regulate national life through national representatives.
('53', 3, 1, 11, 7923) If national life becomes so perfect as to become self regulated, no re presentation is necessary.
('53', 3, 1, 12, 8021) There is then a state of enlightened anarchy.
('53', 3, 1, 13, 8067) In such a state everyone is his own ruler.
('53', 3, 1, 14, 8110) He rules himself in such a manner that he is never a hindrance to his neighbour.
('53', 3, 1, 15, 8191) In the ideal state therefore there is no political power because there is no State.
('53', 3, 1, 16, 8275) But the ideal is never fully realized in life.
('53', 3, 1, 17, 8322) Hence the classical statement of Thoreau that that Government is best which governs the least.
('53', 3, 1, 18, 8417) If then I want political power, it is for the sake of the reforms for which the Congress stands.
('53', 3, 1, 19, 8514) Therefore when the energy to be spent in gaining that power means so much loss of energy required for the reforms, as threatens to be the case if the country is to engage in a duel with the Mussalmans or Sikhs, I would most decidedly advise the country to let the Mussalmans and Sikhs take all the power and I would go on with developing the reforms.
('53', 3, 1, 20, 8865) If we were to analyse the activities of the Congress during the past twelve years, we would discover that the capacity of the Congress to take political power has increased in exact proportion to its ability to achieve success in the constructive effort.
('53', 3, 1, 21, 9120) That is to me the substance of political power.
('53', 3, 1, 22, 9168) Actual taking over of the Government machinery is but a shadow, an emblem.
('53', 3, 1, 23, 9243) And it could easily be a burden if it came as a gift from without, the people having made no effort to deserve it.
('53', 3, 1, 24, 9358) It is now perhaps easy to realize the truth of my statement that the needful can be gained more quickly and more certainly by satyagraha than by political power. Legislation in advance of public opinion has often been demonstrated to be futile.
('53', 3, 1, 25, 9603) Legal prohibition of theft in a country in which the vast majority are thieves would be futile.
('53', 3, 1, 26, 9699) Picketing and the other popular activities are therefore the real
('53', 4, 0, 1, 9765) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 5
('53', 4, 1, 2, 9807) If political power was a thing apart from these reforms, we would have to suspend latter and concentrate on the former.
('53', 4, 1, 3, 9927) But we have followed the contrary course.
('53', 4, 1, 4, 9969) We have everywhere emphasized the necessity of carrying on the constructive activities as being the means of.attaining swaraj.
('53', 4, 1, 5, 10096) I am convinced that whenever legal prohibition of drinks, drugs and foreign cloth comes, it will come because public opinion had demanded it.
('53', 4, 1, 6, 10238) It may be said that public opinion demands it today but the foreign Government does not respond.
('53', 4, 1, 7, 10335) This is only partly right.
('53', 4, 1, 8, 10362) Public opinion in this country is only now becoming a vital force and developing the real sanction which is satyagraha.

('53', 4, 4, 11, 10535) The reader will recall the allegations published last week 1 against a zamindar of a village in Unao.
('53', 4, 4, 12, 10637) This time I have more serious news involving Government officials in the instigation of zamindars and taluqdars.
('53', 4, 4, 13, 10750) Here are copies of two authentic confidential circulars 2 to zamindars signed by the Deputy Commissioner of Rae Bareli.

('53', 5, 1, 2, 11531) You should direct your employees to act promptly and energetically and fearlessly in this matter.
('53', 5, 1, 3, 11629) Yours sincerely, D.O. No.11 DEPUTY COMMISSIONERS OFFICE, RAE BARELI, June 19, 1931 MY DEAR .
('53', 5, 2, 4, 11722) I find that the balance outstanding against you on account of kharif arrears and rabi demand excluding Remissions granted by Government is Rs. .
('53', 5, 2, 5, 11867) 2 This is a very large amount.
('53', 5, 2, 6, 11898) In view of the special difficulties of the year, I have already allowed you sufficient time.
('53', 5, 2, 7, 11991) I shall be grateful, if you will kindly pay up at least half of this balance by the end of this monththe rest thereafter as soon as possible.
('53', 5, 2, 8, 12133) These circulars clearly betray hostility towards the Congress and Kisan Sabhas and invite the taluqdars to strong action against the kisans, promising Government help to them in their measures.
('53', 5, 2, 9, 12327) We all know what such circulars mean.
('53', 5, 2, 10, 12365) They imply much more than the words mean.
('53', 5, 2, 11, 12407) They imply freedom to the addressees to do as they choose.
('53', 5, 2, 12, 12466) And why are these circulars confidential?
('53', 5, 2, 13, 12508) Is there anything for the U.P. Government or the Deputy Commissioner to be ashamed of?
('53', 5, 2, 14, 12595) Or are they confidential because the circulars are a veiled incitement to violence?
('53', 5, 2, 15, 12679) In my opinion the circulars constitute a clear breach of the Settlement.
('53', 5, 2, 16, 12752) These circulars explain why the following extraordi nary notice 3 was served on Congress workers in that district.
('53', 5, 2, 17, 12867) At the time of writing I have information that this notice has been withdrawn.
('53', 5, 2, 18, 12946) This notice would have meant complete stoppage of all Congress activities, as if the Government was at war with the Congress.
('53', 5, 2, 19, 13072) It was a gross and glaring breach of the Settlement.
('53', 5, 2, 20, 13125) For better or for worse there is at present peace between the Government and the Congress.
('53', 5, 2, 21, 13216) And the Provincial Governments and district officials are bound to respect it.
('53', 5, 2, 22, 13295) If they do not like it, or if they think that the Congress is not playing the game, they should ask the Central Government to denounce the Settlement.
('53', 5, 2, 23, 13446) I may inform the reader that even with reference to this order so manifestly contrary to the Settlement, I had advised that, till I had the opportunity of approaching the Central Government and the Working Committee had
('53', 5, 3, 24, 13666) 1 Blank as in the source
('53', 5, 4, 25, 13691) 2 ibid 3 Not reproduced here.
('53', 5, 4, 26, 13721) The District Magistrate, Rae Bareli, had ordered the Congress workers to abstain from speaking or writing anything on the agrarian or political situation of the district.
('53', 6, 0, 1, 13892) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 7
('53', 6, 1, 2, 13934) decided, no one should disobey the order.
('53', 6, 1, 3, 13976) I am glad therefore that the U.P. Government have withdrawn the order.
('53', 6, 1, 4, 14047) Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru had drawn in forcible terms the attention of the U.P. Government to the order.
('53', 6, 1, 5, 14150) This withdrawal should be followed by the withdrawals of the confidential circulars and the policy they adumbrate.
('53', 6, 1, 6, 14265) When I was in Nainital, I was reliably informed that the U.P. Governments policy was not to take sides.
('53', 6, 1, 7, 14369) They had instructed district officers to observe perfect neutrality between the zamindars and the kisans.
('53', 6, 1, 8, 14475) But this policy has evidently been revised as will appear from the following condensed summary 1 of a report before me.
('53', 6, 1, 9, 14595) I have omitted some painful details of this painful story of a broken pact.
('53', 6, 1, 10, 14671) To complete the picture I may mention that I have seen copies of notices served perhaps by the thousand on kisans warning them that they will incur the liability to prosecution if they had dealings with particular Congressmen.
('53', 6, 1, 11, 14898) And all this after the descent of the Deputy Commissioner from Nainital whereto he had been summoned to see H.E. the Governor!
('53', 6, 1, 12, 15025) I hope that there is no connection between the studied terrorism which the foregoing narrative proves and the Nainital visit.
('53', 6, 1, 13, 15151) Be that as it may, there should be no haste on the part of Congressmen, there should be no breaches of orders till the Working Committee has considered the situation.
('53', 6, 1, 14, 15318) It meets on the 7th instant and will consider the extraordinary situation that is developing in several provinces.

('53', 6, 3, 17, 15474) It was a matter of pleasure to me as I know it was to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel to meet the young Europeans in Bombay the other day.
('53', 6, 3, 18, 15606) Several young Europeans have formed themselves into a group for the purpose of studying the Indian situation and then forming their own conclusions and taking their due share in moulding public opinion.
('53', 6, 3, 19, 15809) As behoves earnest students, these gentlemen have eschewed all publicity for their proceedings.
('53', 6, 3, 20, 15905) They invite to their social dinner representatives of all parties and hear their views and ask questions where further elucidation is necessary.
('53', 6, 3, 21, 16050) They pass no resolutions, have framed no policy.
('53', 6, 3, 22, 16099) They approach questions with an open mind.
('53', 6, 3, 23, 16142) These friends deserve congratulations and encouragement in their

('53', 7, 1, 3, 16416) I venture to suggest to them that if they will come to a decision early, if they intend to affect the present political situation, it is necessary for them to classify the subjects for study and appoint from among themselves certain members who would specially study those particular questions and in that connection interview those who represent different parties which bring their influence to bear on them.
('53', 7, 1, 4, 16826) All this undoubtedly means strenuous work.
('53', 7, 1, 5, 16869) But it is necessary if the studies are to bear fruit in the near future.

('53', 8, 6, 20, 18920) The conduct of both has been intolerable.
('53', 8, 6, 21, 18962) 4 is more to blame.
('53', 8, 6, 22, 18982) Let the two marry, if they wish to.

('53', 10, 2, 4, 20573) I would gladly serve on the Federal Structure Committee of the Round Table Conference, if the way is open for me to sail for England in time.
('53', 10, 2, 5, 20715) Will you please inform His Excellency the Viceroy that the working of the Delhi Settlement is causing me great anxiety and is taking up practically the whole of my time to the exclusion of many other important things I would gladly attend to if I was free?
('53', 10, 2, 6, 20972) I am inundated with complaints from fellow workers, which go to show that the Settlement is not being satisfactorily implemented by local officials.
('53', 10, 2, 7, 21121) I shall treat this correspondence as confidential.

('53', 10, 5, 11, 21249) DEAR PRINCIPAL SHIRRAS, I thank you for your prompt reply to my letter of 30th ultimo as also for the correction about non admission of students.
('53', 10, 5, 12, 21395) I have now seen two of them and they tell me that they are not aware of their having created any disturbance in the work of the college unless you have in mind the strike 3 that took place in the college and in which practically the whole college was involved.
('53', 10, 5, 13, 21656) They tell me that if they have been guilty of any conduct which would be considered dishonourable or which would amount to insubordination they are prepared to make proper amends.
('53', 10, 5, 14, 21836) They assure me that they have never desired or promoted any indiscipline in the college.
('53', 10, 5, 15, 21925) They have undoubtedly held strong nationalistic views as they do even now.
('53', 10, 5, 16, 22000) They took an energetic part in the national movement.
('53', 10, 5, 17, 22054) What they tell me is that so far as their conduct in the college is concerned it was free

('53', 11, 1, 2, 22299) from any reproach.
('53', 11, 1, 3, 22318) I understand too that there is nothing to be said against their private character, which I personally, as one having had a great deal to do with students during the past nearly 40 years of public life, attach the greatest importance to.
('53', 11, 1, 4, 22555) They tell me too that they have issued no notice to which any exception can be taken.
('53', 11, 1, 5, 22641) I would therefore thank you to let me know the definite charges which you have in mind and which impelled you to refuse them admission.
('53', 11, 1, 6, 22777) I would also thank you to furnish me with copies of the notices you hold to be objectionable.

('53', 11, 5, 10, 22956) Private AS AT SABARMATI July 3, 1931
('53', 11, 6, 11, 22993) MY DEAR CHARLIE, I have your long letter of 17th June.
('53', 11, 6, 12, 23048) First about the Gallway incident.
('53', 11, 6, 13, 23082) I have not the autobiography with me.
('53', 11, 6, 14, 23120) But there is no conflict between the two statements.
('53', 11, 6, 15, 23173) The healthy rivalry between Europeans and Indians took place during the day on our way to Chieveley camp which we reached at night and immediately received orders from Col.
('53', 11, 6, 16, 23346) Gallway to remove Lieut.
('53', 11, 6, 17, 23371) Robertss remains.
('53', 11, 6, 18, 23389) 1 So you see, there is no contradiction between the reference to the sultry day and the removal of the remains at night.
('53', 11, 6, 19, 23510) Lady Roberts 2 is certainly not the Field Marshals wife, but the wife of Charles Roberts.
('53', 11, 6, 20, 23600) There undoubtedly you have got mixed up.
('53', 11, 6, 21, 23641) The late Field Marshals wife never corresponded with me.
('53', 11, 6, 22, 23698) I have not seen the Times report of my article on the Working Committee resolution 3. I hope that long before this reaches you, you will have seen the full article and found your doubts answered.
('53', 11, 6, 23, 23894) My position is this: The general mass of the population will never be members of legislatures but they will affect the legislatures when they feel their power.
('53', 11, 6, 24, 24054) They can do so if there is adult suffrage.
('53', 11, 6, 25, 24097) Exercise of the suffrage in favour of those who will carry out their will will be one

('53', 12, 1, 2, 24383) form of direct action.
('53', 12, 1, 3, 24406) But they may not have adult suffrage.
('53', 12, 1, 4, 24444) They may not be exercising any influence over the legislatures so far as the constitutional position may be concerned, but if they have imbibed the spirit of non violence and suffering, i.
('53', 12, 1, 5, 24633) e., satyagrah, their influence on the legislatures will be more direct and more effective than that exerted through adult suffrage, by simply refusing to assist the Government in the shape of payment of taxes or in various other ways.
('53', 12, 1, 6, 24868) They can bring the existing Government to book and either get their demands fulfilled or bring it to a standstill.
('53', 12, 1, 7, 24983) Is this not clear?
('53', 12, 1, 8, 25002) Now for the boycott.
('53', 12, 1, 9, 25023) It is being constantly dinned into the ears of the public that the boycott has ceased to be used as a political weapon, i.
('53', 12, 1, 10, 25146) e., for exerting political pressure but that it is being now used as an effective economic weapon.
('53', 12, 1, 11, 25245) There is a statement reported to have been made by Jawaharlal appearing in todays papers.
('53', 12, 1, 12, 25335) I send you herewith a cutting from the daily press.
('53', 12, 1, 13, 25387) But even as an economic weapon it certainly requires intensification.
('53', 12, 1, 14, 25457) Just after the Settlement there was a lull, that is to say, we were all purposely not doing anything to egg the people on to picketing.
('53', 12, 1, 15, 25593) All the Congress committees were left alone even when we, members of the Working Committee, knew that the provincial committees were not keeping picketing up to the mark.
('53', 12, 1, 16, 25764) When the aggressive form ceased all the zest seemed to have disappeared and several committees left off picketing in sullen discontent.
('53', 12, 1, 17, 25900) This state of things could not be permitted to continue, for if this laxity was long overlooked the organization would become inefficient.
('53', 12, 1, 18, 26039) What is more, the Committee could not afford, through it own negligence to see foreign cloth coming in and competing both with khadi and indigenous mill cloth.
('53', 12, 1, 19, 26199) A resolution therefore was absolutely necessary to warn the people that because of the Settlement they were not to neglect their duty of warning the people against buying foreign cloth.
('53', 12, 1, 20, 26385) I see nothing inconsistent with ahimsa in this or with the terms of the Settlement.
('53', 12, 1, 21, 26469) Even an economic boycott requires strict vigilance, if the people are to be weaned from a habit of practically a century.
('53', 12, 1, 22, 26591) They have to be repeatedly reminded that it is a bad habit.
('53', 12, 1, 23, 26651) The test that the boycott now is purely economic lies in this, that there is not boycott of British cloth or British goods as such.
('53', 12, 1, 24, 26783) That boycott was most effectively used during the campaign frankly as a political weapon and stopped as if by magic immediately
('53', 13, 0, 1, 26911) 14 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 13, 1, 2, 26952) the Settlement was announced.
('53', 13, 1, 3, 26982) This can be proved by producing conclusive evidence that almost the day after the Settlement orders for British machinery, British drugs and the like were despatched.
('53', 13, 1, 4, 27149) Have I made the position clear?
('53', 13, 1, 5, 27181) I can assure you that there is no desire on the part of any member of the Working Committee to use the economic boycott as a political weapon.
('53', 13, 1, 6, 27324) That it has political consequences is not to be denied.
('53', 13, 1, 7, 27380) The fact was before both Lord Irwin and myself during our talks and he recognized that it was inevitable.
('53', 13, 1, 8, 27486) But you can examine the position in this way also.
('53', 13, 1, 9, 27537) Supposing that Lancashire withdrew its trade in piece goods from India which is after all 12%, boycott of foreign cloth will still continue although the competitor will be chiefly Japan.
('53', 13, 1, 10, 27724) To complete the case I am sending you the correspondence bearing on the question between the Central Government and myself.
('53', 13, 1, 11, 27848) Much as I should like to have you by my side here, I would not think of dragging you here from England.
('53', 13, 1, 12, 27952) You are doing great work there and I think you are in the right place.
('53', 13, 1, 13, 28023) If I do not come to England at all it might then be necessary for you to come here if only for a short time.
('53', 13, 1, 14, 28132) But the contingency we need not discuss just now.

('53', 15, 3, 4, 29208) DEAR ANAND, If I am to write, for the time being you must be satisfied with dictated letters.
('53', 15, 3, 5, 29302) I have yours of 23rd June.
('53', 15, 3, 6, 29329) I met Jairamdas yesterday and he told me that Vidya was worse and that milk was not agreeing with her.
('53', 15, 3, 7, 29432) That was quite likely and I had, I think, in Karachi suggested that she might live on fruit alone for some time.
('53', 15, 3, 8, 29545) But the very best thing is for her to put herself under the treatment of the nature cure physician of Poona about whom I talked to Jairamdas and about whom Jairamdas has already written to you.
('53', 15, 3, 9, 29739) I do not know him personally but I have great faith in Dr. Khambatta 1, whom the Poona physician treated for suspected cancer.

('53', 16, 1, 3, 30501) I have implicit faith that Hindus and Mussalmans will one day come together and that faith is derived from my faith in Hinduism and ultimately in human nature.
('53', 16, 1, 4, 30661) If Hinduism deserves to live it must disarm all opposition.
('53', 16, 1, 5, 30721) Going a step further, I believe that all mankind will never possess one faith but all the faiths that deserve to live will tolerate one another and they will be like flowers of the same plant all beautifully scented, all looking similar and yet each having a distinct individuality.

('53', 16, 6, 14, 31289) I am writing to Sir Cowasji.
('53', 16, 6, 15, 31318) I believe in the saying, Take care of the pence and the pounds will take care of themselves. However, what preparations need I make?
('53', 16, 6, 16, 31451) As a servant, I have only to deliver the Masters message.

('53', 17, 4, 6, 32541) 20. KATHIAWAR POLITICAL CONFERENCE
('53', 17, 5, 7, 32576) At its Bhavnagar session this Conference imposed on itself a restriction not to criticize the affairs of one State in the territory of another State.
('53', 17, 5, 8, 32726) 3 Some had not quite liked this self restraint, but all had willingly or unwillingly accepted it.
('53', 17, 5, 9, 32824) There are now rumours of a move for the removal of the restriction.
('53', 17, 5, 10, 32892) The argument in favour of the removal is this: When we accepted the restriction, we did so because of the peoples weakness; but the time has now changed and hence the restriction should go.
('53', 17, 5, 11, 33082) If the Kathiawar Political Conference wishes to remove the restriction, it has a full right to do so.
('53', 17, 5, 12, 33184) I think either the Conference should be convened to lift it or the Executive Committee should run the risk of exceeding its constitutional authority and rescind the Resolution passed at the Conference.
('53', 17, 5, 13, 33386) It would become the duty of the Executive Committee to act in that manner when its members definitely feel that public opinion demands such a step and that it must be taken immediately.
('53', 17, 5, 14, 33572) Here, however, I wish to discuss only the necessity or otherwise of that self restraint.
('53', 17, 5, 15, 33661) I think that the restraint was not a sign of weakness, but was, and even today is, a mark of civility.
('53', 17, 5, 16, 33764) It was certainly inspired by a recognition of the condition of the Princes.
('53', 17, 5, 17, 33840) It is the duty of the Conference to take account of their condition and the fact that it did so was a sign of its practical wisdom.
('53', 17, 5, 18, 33972) It stands to lose nothing through that restraint and much to gain.
('53', 17, 6, 19, 34039) 1 The letter was released by Reuter from London on July 5. 2 Kingsley Hall, a welfare workers settlement in the East End, London 3 It was at the fourth Conference at Porbandar on January 22, 1928 that Gandhiji moved from the chair a resolution adopting the restriction; vide Speech at Kathiawar Political Conference, Porbandar, 22 1 1928
('53', 18, 0, 1, 34377) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 19
('53', 18, 1, 2, 34420) Anyone following the path of non violence and truth would willingly observe the restriction.
('53', 18, 1, 3, 34513) I would, therefore, go so far as to say that a satyagrahi would observe it not merely because such is the Resolution of the Kathiawar Political Conference but also because it is necessary in itself.
('53', 18, 1, 4, 34712) It is malicious propaganda to criticize the evils of State A in the territory of State B. It is cowardice to do so.
('53', 18, 1, 5, 34828) Bravery lies in going to State A and exposing its evils there.
('53', 18, 1, 6, 34891) As A and B are on friendly terms, B would be in a difficult position if A is criticized in Bs territory.
('53', 18, 1, 7, 34996) Without sufficient reason, a satyagrahi would not put any person into an embarrassing position.
('53', 18, 1, 8, 35092) It may, however, be argued that when it is not possible to go to As State to criticize him, there should be some place where it could be done.
('53', 18, 1, 9, 35235) The reply to this is simple.
('53', 18, 1, 10, 35264) As the Indian States are subject to the authority of the British Government, all such subject States can be criticized, and are criticized, in British Indian territory.
('53', 18, 1, 11, 35433) Hence, even after the experience of so many years, I cling to my view: The self restraint imposed at Bhavnagar is just as necessary now as it was then.
('53', 18, 1, 12, 35585) To a satyagrahi it is binding whether or not he belongs to the Conference.
('53', 18, 1, 13, 35660) If the time has truly changed, we ought to be strong enough to go to the State concerned and compel it to remedy the evils.
('53', 18, 1, 14, 35784) What courage do we show by criticizing the evils of a State outside its borders?
('53', 18, 1, 15, 35865) [From Gujarati] Navajivan, 5 7 1931
('53', 18, 2, 16, 35901) 21. INDIA STATES AND SATYAGRAHA
('53', 18, 3, 17, 35933) I have two letters lying with me.
('53', 18, 3, 18, 35967) One is addressed to me and the other is addressed to Kishorelalbhai who has sent it to me for reply.
('53', 18, 3, 19, 36068) The following is the substance of the letter addressed to me: You stop the satyagraha which has been going on in A, in B you blame those who started it, in C you advise them to slacken its pace and in D you permit an inexperienced leader to start it.
('53', 18, 3, 20, 36319) Instead of putting yourself in such a false position, why dont you advise people to stop satyagraha altogether for the present and take up khadi work only and through it acquire fitness for satyagraha?
('53', 18, 3, 21, 36521) The long letter addressed to Kishorelalbhai is full of anger: The Congress seems to think that it can treat us, workers in
('53', 19, 0, 1, 36644) 20 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 19, 1, 2, 36685) the Indian States, as it likes.
('53', 19, 1, 3, 36717) During the struggle, we suffered beatings and went to jail.
('53', 19, 1, 4, 36777) Now that there is a Settlement, we are treated as mere dirt.
('53', 19, 1, 5, 36838) Our letters are thrown into the dustbin by the secretary.
('53', 19, 1, 6, 36896) If we wish to show our spirit, it will adversely affect the Settlement between the Congress and the Government!
('53', 19, 1, 7, 37008) It does not matter if the authorities of the States crush us.
('53', 19, 1, 8, 37070) When a brave person like Fulchandbhai shows his courage, such orders are issued as would kill his spirit.
('53', 19, 1, 9, 37176) What sort of principle is there behind all this?
('53', 19, 1, 10, 37225) What sort of a Settlement is this?
('53', 19, 1, 11, 37260) Shall we ever be able to win swaraj in this manner?
('53', 19, 1, 12, 37312) I have summarized this long letter from memory.
('53', 19, 1, 13, 37360) The correspondents anger seems pardonable.
('53', 19, 1, 14, 37403) He has suffered and in the heat of excitement has made no effort to understand the position carefully.
('53', 19, 1, 15, 37506) I take the first letter first.
('53', 19, 1, 16, 37537) It is true that I gave four seemingly contradictory opinions in regard to four different sets of circumstan ces.
('53', 19, 1, 17, 37650) But really speaking they are not contradictory.
('53', 19, 1, 18, 37698) Lifes experiments are like chemical experiments.
('53', 19, 1, 19, 37747) In a chemical experiment, if the quantity of one ingredient is increased or decreased different results follow.
('53', 19, 1, 20, 37859) If even a drop of one more substance is added an altogether new compound results.
('53', 19, 1, 21, 37941) In the same way in life owing to differences in the characters of workers and local conditions, the situation changes and different opinions are given.
('53', 19, 1, 22, 38093) If this were not so, life would cease to be life and be reduced to a mechanical process.
('53', 19, 1, 23, 38182) What matters is whether the different opinions are based on the same principle.
('53', 19, 1, 24, 38262) In the cases in which the satyagrahis were subject to my control and in which my name was being used, I had to bear in mind the different situations and give opinions accordingly, and they were right.
('53', 19, 1, 25, 38463) In the fourth case the person had taken a pledge to offer satyagraha.
('53', 19, 1, 26, 38533) He did not belong to any organization.
('53', 19, 1, 27, 38572) He relied on his own strength.
('53', 19, 1, 28, 38603) The only drawback in his action was that he had been hasty in taking the pledge.
('53', 19, 1, 29, 38684) If at all, he alone would suffer because of that.
('53', 19, 1, 30, 38734) In these circumstances, how could I, when my opinion was asked, commit the sin of persuading him to violate his pledge?
('53', 19, 1, 31, 38854) How could I discourage him?
('53', 19, 1, 32, 38882) The only right I had was to examine his pledge and say whether it violated any moral principle.
('53', 19, 1, 33, 38978) I therefore expressed the view that there was no moral flaw in the pledge itself and that it was his duty to carry it out.
('53', 19, 1, 34, 39101) The principle is this: A pledge of satyagraha, which is not
('53', 20, 0, 1, 39161) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 21
('53', 20, 1, 2, 39204) against non violence and the consequences of carrying out which are likely to be suffered only by the person taking it, must be kept at any cost, even if that person had not thought about the consequences and had not consulted anybody and had relied on his own strength.
('53', 20, 1, 3, 39475) There have been countless such brave, unknown satyagrahis in the world.
('53', 20, 1, 4, 39547) No one builds monuments in their honour, their names are not recorded in history, nor are their actions reported in newspapers.
('53', 20, 1, 5, 39675) Their names are recorded in Gods book and we may be sure that it is because of their strength that the world endures.
('53', 20, 1, 6, 39793) Anyone who obstructs them in their work is not a wise man.
('53', 20, 1, 7, 39852) He is sunk in the pit of ignorance and, trying to be overwise, obstructs manly effort.
('53', 20, 1, 8, 39939) The principle looks admirable when thus explained, but I have to face difficult moral issues every hour in my life in trying to follow it in practice and guiding my co workers according to it.
('53', 20, 1, 9, 40132) Following the rule that where there are no other trees a castor oil plant is as good as a tree, for want of a leader with greater wisdom, I act as a judge and go on issuing orders to my co workers.
('53', 20, 1, 10, 40330) My experience is that my views have not harmed either my co workers or the public.
('53', 20, 1, 11, 40413) Both have advanced.
('53', 20, 1, 12, 40433) My co workers have often felt unhappy while following my opinions but many of them have also realized that their suffering was ultimately for their good.
('53', 20, 1, 13, 40587) The Settlement between the Congress and the Government has no connection with the Indian States.
('53', 20, 1, 14, 40684) There was no struggle in the States, and so none of the conditions of the Settlement apply to them.
('53', 20, 1, 15, 40784) Even if the Government wanted to do so, it had no right to bind them.
('53', 20, 1, 16, 40854) So, in principle, neither the Rulers nor the subjects are bound by the Settlement in any way.
('53', 20, 1, 17, 40948) It puts no check on either.
('53', 20, 1, 18, 40976) The subjects can offer satyagraha or resort to civil disobedience.
('53', 20, 1, 19, 41043) But to have such a right is one thing and to exercise it is quite another matter.
('53', 20, 1, 20, 41125) Whether in a given case satyagraha is justified and those who wish to offer it are qualified to do so can be decided only after considering the circumstances of the case.
('53', 20, 1, 21, 41296) When my co workers ask for my advice, I have to guide them, and I tell them that though they had a right to offer satyagraha, the time or the occasion was not suitable.
('53', 20, 1, 22, 41465) Generally speaking my opinion today is the same that I have expressed before.
('53', 20, 1, 23, 41543) If the subjects of Indian States are satisfied with such reform as can be secured peacefully and engage themselves in constructive work, they will get all the sooner the status which they desire.
('53', 20, 1, 24, 41739) I am convinced that when British India has won swaraj, most
('53', 21, 0, 1, 41799) 22 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 21, 1, 2, 41840) problems of the Indian States will be automatically solved.
('53', 21, 1, 3, 41900) It is very sad that there are very few constructive workers in the Indian States.
('53', 21, 1, 4, 41982) I feel no hesitation at all in saying that one who has not done some constructive work has not learnt the first lesson of satyagraha.
('53', 21, 1, 5, 42116) According to me constructive work means the spinning wheel and khadi, eradication of untouchability, propaganda against the drink evil and Hindu Muslim unity.
('53', 21, 1, 6, 42275) One whose heart is not filled with the spirit of service and with love, how can he offer satyagraha?
('53', 21, 1, 7, 42376) Even in British India, the number of such workers is small.
('53', 21, 1, 8, 42436) It is smaller still in the Indian States.
('53', 21, 1, 9, 42478) That is why I feel reluctant to advise satyagraha in those States.
('53', 21, 1, 10, 42545) This article is not meant for those who do not feel bound to ask or follow my advice.
('53', 21, 1, 11, 42631) He who by his very nature is non violent, who is a born satyagrahi, who loves truth with all his being and is the very image of service, such a person deserves to be revered by the whole world.
('53', 21, 1, 12, 42825) I need not say that he does not require my advice and is qualified to offer sataygraha whenever he wishes to do so.
('53', 21, 1, 13, 42941) But to those who are full of anger and pride and whose ego is very strong, who cannot think clearly because of excitement, I will definitely sayPlease wait.
('53', 21, 1, 14, 43098) If they take a hasty step even unintentionally, its result is bound to be bitter.
('53', 21, 1, 15, 43180) Whatever self restraint is observed now will also disappear and the future generations which will suffer from the tyranny of false satyagraha will curse us and blame satyagraha itself.
('53', 21, 1, 16, 43365) Hence every thoughtful person should know the limits of satyagraha.
('53', 21, 1, 17, 43433) Those who do not do so should stop using the name of satyagraha and then act as they wish.
('53', 21, 1, 18, 43524) The world will know where they stand.
('53', 21, 1, 19, 43562) But the things which are done in the name of satyagraha and which are unworthy of it will confuse and perplex the people and they will not know what path to follow.
('53', 21, 1, 20, 43727) Now the second letter.
('53', 21, 1, 21, 43750) Most of the answer to it is contained in what I have stated above.
('53', 21, 1, 22, 43817) The Congress has never come in the way of movements in the Indian States.
('53', 21, 1, 23, 43891) It has not stopped anyone from offering satyagraha in them.
('53', 21, 1, 24, 43951) If anyone has stopped any such movement, it is I. But in every case there was a reason for my doing so.
('53', 21, 1, 25, 44055) Those who took part in the last satyagraha movement have not obliged the Congress or any individual.
('53', 21, 1, 26, 44156) If at all, they have obliged themselves.
('53', 21, 1, 27, 44197) It was the duty of every Indian to take part in it.
('53', 21, 1, 28, 44249) Political rule has divided India into four parts, British India, Indian States, Portuguese India and French India.
('53', 21, 1, 29, 44364) But Nature has made it one.
('53', 22, 0, 1, 44392) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 23
('53', 22, 1, 2, 44435) rulers may distinguish between one part of the country and another but in fact we are one country.
('53', 22, 1, 3, 44534) If the most important part becomes independent, wins swaraj, the other parts will automatically become strong.
('53', 22, 1, 4, 44645) If, therefore, all of us, whether we live in the Indian States or outside, use all our strength in the British part and win swaraj, a good many reforms will come about automatically in the Indian States.
('53', 22, 1, 5, 44849) On the contrary, if we offer untimely satyagraha in the Indian States and waste peoples strength on them, swaraj will recede farther from us.

('53', 22, 3, 7, 45027) 22. DIGAMBAR SADHUS
('53', 22, 4, 8, 45047) I have received many letters of criticism for the views which I have expressed about nakedness.
('53', 22, 4, 9, 45143) Some of the correspondents have written in anger too.
('53', 22, 4, 10, 45197) I have also been advised to withdraw my remarks, as the feelings of Digambar Jains have been hurt.
('53', 22, 4, 11, 45296) I had written my article 1 with a purely religious motive.
('53', 22, 4, 12, 45355) Such articles should not be withdrawn even to soothe the feelings of friends.
('53', 22, 4, 13, 45433) If they are withdrawn, it will not be possible to discuss religious issues in a friendly manner.
('53', 22, 4, 14, 45530) I have stated that Sardars words are not law.
('53', 22, 4, 15, 45576) When we have won swaraj, everything will be done according to peoples views.
('53', 22, 4, 16, 45653) Laws which hurt religious sentiments will not be permitted.
('53', 22, 4, 17, 45713) It will, of course, be necessary to consider what is religious sentiment.
('53', 22, 4, 18, 45787) That also will be decided by the courts.
('53', 22, 4, 19, 45828) People like me can only discuss such questions and create public opinion.
('53', 22, 4, 20, 45902) I, therefore, request the Digambar Jains to discuss this subject in an objective manner and permit others also to discuss it in that manner.
('53', 22, 4, 21, 46043) I am so partial to Jainism that many people think that I am a Jain.
('53', 22, 4, 22, 46111) When, in a meeting of Jains whom I did not know, I had to explain that I was not a Jain in order to refuse an honour which I did not deserve, the Jain friends in my circle were surprised and shocked.
('53', 22, 4, 23, 46311) I have regard for the Digambar sect.
('53', 22, 4, 24, 46348) I have read some of their religious books.
('53', 22, 4, 25, 46391) As an ideal, I like the naked state.
('53', 22, 4, 26, 46428) I have deliberately let my children move about naked.
('53', 22, 4, 27, 46482) Hence everyone should take it for granted that my views on the subject have been expressed in a friendly spirit and for the protection of dharma.
('53', 22, 4, 28, 46628) I may be wrong in holding
('53', 22, 5, 29, 46654) 1 Vide Limits ato Freedom,31 5 1931
('53', 23, 0, 1, 46690) 24 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 23, 1, 2, 46731) these views.
('53', 23, 1, 3, 46744) Those whose reason does not approve of them may, therefore, certainly reject them.
('53', 23, 1, 4, 46827) But they should not get angry with me.
('53', 23, 1, 5, 46866) Anger hinders a proper understanding of religious or other ideas and should, therefore, be eschewed.
('53', 23, 1, 6, 46967) I now come to the main issue.
('53', 23, 1, 7, 46997) The criticism 1 in the issue of Jain Mitra of Ashadh Vad 4 is inspired by a sincere motive.
('53', 23, 1, 8, 47089) It includes the substance of what others have said and so I will content myself with a reply to it.
('53', 23, 1, 9, 47189) Those who have not read that article may find it difficult to understand my answer, and I therefore request them to get that article and read it.
('53', 23, 1, 10, 47335) Digambar sadhus may be pure minded.
('53', 23, 1, 11, 47371) But I cannot accept the claim that all of them are so.
('53', 23, 1, 12, 47426) I believe that no one should claim to be a sadhu.
('53', 23, 1, 13, 47476) The fact that a person is a sadhu should be self evident to others.
('53', 23, 1, 14, 47544) A person is not a sadhu if it is necessary to prove or claim that he is one.
('53', 23, 1, 15, 47621) A true sadhu requires no protection.
('53', 23, 1, 16, 47658) Digambar sadhus should represent the highest state which a sadhu can attain.
('53', 23, 1, 17, 47735) Why should they require anyones help to uphold their status?
('53', 23, 1, 18, 47796) Such an ideal Digambar sadhu needs no protection from the law or from a court.
('53', 23, 1, 19, 47875) It is surprising that such natural innocence should even attract the attention of others.
('53', 23, 1, 20, 47965) But in the present age, it need not be surprising that such a person does draw the attention of others and if he has to appear in a court or is sent to jail, he should regard that as a God sent opportunity to demonstrate the greatness of the Digambar ideal.
('53', 23, 1, 21, 48223) There are real sadhus and fake ones too.
('53', 23, 1, 22, 48264) There is no limit to the number of the latter.
('53', 23, 1, 23, 48311) Who will differentiate between the two?
('53', 23, 1, 24, 48351) Should we not stop anyone moving around naked?
('53', 23, 1, 25, 48398) Will no harm result if we do not?
('53', 23, 1, 26, 48432) It is not true to say that a person with an impure mind cannot remain naked.
('53', 23, 1, 27, 48509) Once you disregard social restraints, why should an impure minded person not abandon decency?
('53', 23, 1, 28, 48603) Why should anyone feel ashamed of remaining naked even when he may be impure?
('53', 23, 1, 29, 48681) The advocates of nudity as a normal state think that there is no harm if men and women remain naked even though they may have impure thoughts.
('53', 23, 1, 30, 48824) They also hold that the attraction of sex is the normal condition for human beings and that, if nudity increases such attraction, there is nothing wrong in it.
('53', 23, 1, 31, 48984) If the sex urge is a normal condition, then its gratification should also be accepted as normal.
('53', 23, 1, 32, 49081) So there is nothing wrong in remaining naked.
('53', 23, 1, 33, 49127) That is the view of these lovers of sense pleasures, who believe in the religion of enjoyment.
('53', 23, 1, 34, 49222) Are those Digambar Jains who have regard for decency and believe in self control ready to support this view?
('53', 23, 1, 35, 49331) Are they ready to see society

('53', 24, 1, 2, 49474) turned into a scene of sensuality?
('53', 24, 1, 3, 49509) Would they like to be responsible for such a state of affairs?
('53', 24, 1, 4, 49572) I am sure they feel disgusted even as they read this.
('53', 24, 1, 5, 49626) Thus, if they go deep into the matter, they will see that it is our duty in this age to observe the custom of covering the private parts.
('53', 24, 1, 6, 49764) The Digambar sadhus, therefore, should wear a codpiece for a little while out of regard for society, or, if they move naked, they should be ready to suffer for doing so and not raise an outcry about it.
('53', 24, 1, 7, 49967) If we believe in the necessity of social restraints.
('53', 24, 1, 8, 50020) irrespective of whether or not we are Jains, we cannot follow the ideal of nudity in practice.
('53', 24, 1, 9, 50115) If we try to make exceptions, we invite difficulties and therefore we should make no exception.
('53', 24, 1, 10, 50211) Why do we let children move naked?
('53', 24, 1, 11, 50246) Does anyone force a child not to remain naked. There is a fallacy in this comparison.
('53', 24, 1, 12, 50332) A child is by, nature innocent.
('53', 24, 1, 13, 50364) Out of crores of sadhus, hardly one attains such a state after a long discipline.
('53', 24, 1, 14, 50446) Everywhere in the world children remain naked, but even among sadhus the naked state is exceptional.
('53', 24, 1, 15, 50547) In a child, impure thoughts are impossible but all the sadhus are not free from them.
('53', 24, 1, 16, 50633) A blind person can make out a child, but even those who can see can hardly distinguish a true sadhu from a false one.
('53', 24, 1, 17, 50751) So the example of a child remaining naked does not help us in coming to a decision in this matter.
('53', 24, 1, 18, 50850) On the contrary, it shows that nakedness, which befits a child, does not only seem improper when we have grown out of childhood but is positively shameful.
('53', 24, 1, 19, 51006) For these reasons, though I worship the ideal of nakedness for a pure sadhu, I do believe that the leaders of Digambar sadhus should think more deeply on this matter and find out a way for those sadhus who move about in public to cover themselves.
('53', 24, 1, 20, 51254) By doing so, they will safeguard dharma and win greater respect for sadhus.
('53', 24, 1, 21, 51330) Even if they cannot find such a way, an outcry over the issue will certainly do harm.

('53', 25, 1, 3, 51870) But that, good as it is, is surely not enough.
('53', 25, 1, 4, 51917) Wholesale gagging of Congressmen, their arrests, hundreds of notices on kisans bode ill, and make me extremely nervous as to the situation.
('53', 25, 1, 5, 52057) These ill omens are enforced by bad news from the provinces.

('53', 25, 1, 7, 52171) I am not feeling much better here either, though I am putting off the agony by exercising the greatest patience, and continually seeing local officials.

('53', 25, 3, 13, 52584) AS AT SABARMATI, July 5, 1931
('53', 25, 4, 14, 52614) DEAR MR. MAXWELL, Mr. Bhadrapur, the Collector of Kaira, writes to me with reference to my application for the reappointment of the old Mukhi of Ras that the Matadars will not be reappointed.
('53', 25, 4, 15, 52806) I take this to mean that not only will not the old Mukhi be reappointed but also that no Mukhi will be appointed out of the old Matadars.
('53', 25, 4, 16, 52944) Mr. Bhadrapur is not clear whether Government orders also mean that the present acting Mukhi will not be removed.
('53', 25, 4, 17, 53058) My reading of the Settlement is that wherever the present acting Mukhi is not a desirable man or is not permanently appointed, the old Mukhi if he resigned owing to civil disobedience should be reappointed.
('53', 25, 4, 18, 53265) The Collector Mr. Perry even offered to reappoint the old Mukhi if I would consent to the retention of the present Dharala Mukhi as a co Mukhi.
('53', 25, 4, 19, 53409) I could not consent to any such arrangement as it would mean sowing discord between Patidars and Dharalas.
('53', 25, 4, 20, 53516) If these orders are not revised an impossible situation wholly inconsistent with the spirit of the Settlement will arise, and the Patidars will be penalized for having dared to offer civil disobedience.
('53', 25, 4, 21, 53719) I hope, however, that the Government has no desire to penalize the Patidars.
('53', 25, 4, 22, 53796) In virtue of the Settlement, therefore, I ask for a reconsideration of the orders and removal of the present Mukhi who, I have already shown to the Collector, is undesirable and who is not

('53', 26, 5, 9, 54407) MIRA, I have all your letters.
('53', 26, 5, 10, 54438) Mother is slowly going.
('53', 26, 5, 11, 54462) It will be well if the end comes soon.
('53', 26, 5, 12, 54501) It is better to leave a body one has outgrown.
('53', 26, 5, 13, 54548) To wish to see the dearest ones as long as possible in the flesh is a selfish desire and it comes out of weakness or want of faith in the survival of the soul after the dissolution of the body.
('53', 26, 5, 14, 54742) The form ever changes, ever perishes, the informing spirit neither changes nor perishes.
('53', 26, 5, 15, 54831) True love consists in transferring itself from the body to the dweller within and then necessarily realizing the oneness of all life inhabiting numberless bodies.
('53', 26, 5, 16, 54994) You will now see why I do not tempt you to go to London now.
('53', 26, 5, 17, 55055) But you know that you are at liberty to do so, if your love impels you thither.
('53', 26, 5, 18, 55135) There would be nothing wrong if you felt the urge to go.
('53', 26, 5, 19, 55192) I am writing to Father Elwin today not to hesitate to tell you what he wants.
('53', 26, 5, 20, 55270) I am at ease, you being there.
('53', 26, 5, 21, 55301) It lessens Narandass strain also.
('53', 26, 5, 22, 55335) Yes, Gangabehn has the blues on.
('53', 26, 5, 23, 55368) You should distract her attention from herself by occupying her in useful service.
('53', 26, 5, 24, 55451) I was forgetting all about Shankerlals proposal.

('53', 26, 5, 26, 55544) And the Ashram needs you as much as you need the Ashram.
('53', 26, 5, 27, 55601) You will later on certainly entertain proposals for pure khadi tours.

('53', 28, 3, 14, 58289) If you have received the sum, or when you receive it, credit it to her name.
('53', 28, 3, 15, 58366) Preserve her address.
('53', 28, 3, 16, 58388) Note it in the account book itself.
('53', 28, 3, 17, 58424) Her condition for the donation is that we should convert boys to Christianity, give them Christian names and use the money to help them.
('53', 28, 3, 18, 58561) I have replied to her that we can never do what she suggests.
('53', 28, 3, 19, 58623) If she sends a cheque, it would be much better to return it.
('53', 28, 3, 20, 58684) Think about this.
('53', 28, 3, 21, 58702) I will tell her that her gift will be credited to her name but that, if she does not withdraw her condition, the sum will be returned to her.
('53', 28, 3, 22, 58844) As I write this, I feel that we should return the sum no matter with what conditions it is offered.
('53', 28, 3, 23, 58944) You should, therefore, return it.
('53', 28, 3, 24, 58978) I will write and tell her that the sum will be returned.

('53', 29, 3, 5, 59622) The Settlement leaves the Congress free to press for any claim it chooses.
('53', 29, 3, 6, 59697) The mandate given to me by the Congress is unequivocal.

('53', 29, 3, 9, 59893) Safeguards must be demonstrably in the interests of India.
('53', 29, 4, 10, 59952) Asked about the report current that he proposed to ask the Government to agree to refer all the outstanding disputes regarding the implementing of the Truce terms to an arbitration board, Gandhiji said: 1 dont want to make any statement on this matter at this stage.
('53', 29, 5, 11, 60219) The talk then turned on the foreign cloth re export scheme.
('53', 29, 5, 12, 60279) Gandhiji said he had no doubts whatsoever that the scheme would be a success.
('53', 29, 5, 13, 60357) The problem could be solved in no time if the merchants were favourably inclined.
('53', 29, 5, 14, 60439) It was wrong to say that the Ahmedabad millowners were not contributing their share.
('53', 29, 5, 15, 60524) There had been some delay, and he had no doubt that the Ahmedabad millowners would contribute their share.
('53', 29, 5, 16, 60631) The whole scheme was a bona fide one, and intended to give as much relief as possible to those merchants who were prepared to give up trade in foreign cloth and take to swadeshi.

('53', 30, 5, 6, 61385) Complaints are pouring in from many parts that the local officials are breaking the Delhi Pact to pieces and that it almost looks as if the Government was at war with the Congress and therefore every Congressman almost was a suspect.

('53', 31, 1, 9, 63545) I purposely suppressed the news of the details of which I was in full possession.
('53', 31, 2, 10, 63627) IN THE PUNJAB
('53', 31, 3, 11, 63641) I take the following from the letter 1 dated 24th June from the Secretary, District Congress Committee, Amritsar.
('53', 31, 3, 12, 63755) From the letter of Lala Dunichand of Ambala dated 23rd June, I take the following paragraphs 2: The Ludhiana outrage referred to in the quotation is said to have taken place on 16th May last.
('53', 31, 3, 13, 63947) On receipt of a telegram from Ludhiana at Simla and reinforced by a personal visit by the Congress Secretary at Ludhiana, I asked Lala Dunichand to inquire into the allegations.
('53', 31, 3, 14, 64125) 3 He kindly and promptly went to Ludhiana and reported.
('53', 31, 3, 15, 64181) This was followed by more elaborate inquiry instituted by the Bar Association of Ludhiana.
('53', 31, 3, 16, 64272) The Secretary of the Association, too, kindly sent me a copy of the report.
('53', 31, 3, 17, 64348) Both the reports were suppressed by me from the readers of Young India for reasons already stated.
('53', 31, 3, 18, 64447) Both agree in finding that a peaceful meeting held for an absolutely innocent purpose was mercilessly broken up in the presence of the City Magistrate.
('53', 31, 3, 19, 64599) The Naushahra Panuan punitive police is a manifest breach of the Pact, if the facts are as recited by Lala Dunichand in his letter to the Punjab Government which I have read.
('53', 31, 3, 20, 64774) In no case could the expenses of the police be recovered from the people unless it could be clearly proved that the police was imposed for reasons wholly unconnected with civil disobedience.
('53', 31, 4, 21, 64965) 1 Not reproduced here.
('53', 31, 4, 22, 64988) It described how the local authority lathi charged processions and arrested Congress workers.
('53', 31, 4, 23, 65082) 2 Not reproduced here.
('53', 31, 4, 24, 65105) The letter stated that political meetings were not allo wed and the Congress movement was being crushed in the Punjab.

('53', 32, 1, 2, 65304) From Rohtak comes the complaint that peaceful Congressmen are being arrested without any cause that the Congress authorities can divine.
('53', 32, 1, 3, 65441) The authorities know Lala Shamlal of Rohtak personally.
('53', 32, 1, 4, 65497) He is a well known advocate of the place and president of the local Congress Committee.
('53', 32, 1, 5, 65585) They do not seem to have troubled to bring to his notice the conduct or speeches of the offending Congressmen.
('53', 32, 2, 6, 65696) IN BENGAL
('53', 32, 3, 7, 65706) From the Contai Congress Committee was received the following wire about 20th June last.
('53', 32, 4, 8, 65795) Contai Government officials breaking Truce terms, arrested local Congress workers engaged in peaceful constructive work.
('53', 32, 4, 9, 65916) Local Government alarmed at success of Congress arbitration.
('53', 32, 4, 10, 65977) Trying to destroy it by these arrests.
('53', 32, 4, 11, 66016) Viceroy has been wired.
('53', 32, 4, 12, 66040) Pray your intervention.
('53', 32, 4, 13, 66064) Letter follows.
('53', 32, 4, 14, 66080) From the letter referred to in the foregoing I take the following interesting paragraphs 1: I must forbear to say anything about Gujarat.
('53', 32, 4, 15, 66218) I am too near the scene to want to say anything just now.
('53', 32, 4, 16, 66276) But the fact that the Sardar is hooked to Bardoli and I to Borsad has a meaning.
('53', 32, 4, 17, 66357) But I must take the public into confidence about what is going on in some parts of the Bombay Presidency about liquor.
('53', 32, 4, 18, 66476) Let the following 2 from the letter from Vengurla (Ratnagiri District) tell its own tale.
('53', 32, 4, 19, 66566) Much the same is going on in Ahmedabad where there never has been a departure from the peacefullest picketing.
('53', 32, 4, 20, 66677) My untutored mind tells me that these liquor sales are illicit and should be suppressed by the Government as being in breach of the Pact.
('53', 32, 4, 21, 66815) If, however, they are claimed to be legal it is so much the worse and a double breach.
('53', 32, 4, 22, 66902) The foregoing is enough for this week.
('53', 32, 4, 23, 66941) I have other complaints and from other parts of Provinces.
('53', 32, 4, 24, 67000) I must deal with them in a future issue.
('53', 32, 4, 25, 67041) The impatient Congressmen who read this catalogue of comp laints may well ask then: How long are we to wait and bear this?: My

('53', 32, 5, 27, 67213) The letter described how liquor dealers were trying to out manoeuvre the picketing by keeping odd hours and selling the liquor at places other than the shops.

('53', 33, 1, 2, 67413) answer is the same as last week.
('53', 33, 1, 3, 67446) You must wait as long as the Working Committee thinks it necessary. 1 Two wrongs will not make one right.
('53', 33, 1, 4, 67552) If some local Governments are going wrong as they seem to me to be, there is no reason for the Congress to do likewise.
('53', 33, 1, 5, 67672) We must continue to fulfil our part of the agreement.
('53', 33, 1, 6, 67726) If it must break, let it break in spite of the whole of the Congress effort to the contrary.
('53', 33, 1, 7, 67819) The greater our patience another word for suffering the greater will be our strength.

('53', 33, 4, 10, 67952) Many American friends write to me on the American visit which reporters had planned for me.
('53', 33, 4, 11, 68044) Those Americans who are in close touch with me have earnestly dissuaded me from it.
('53', 33, 4, 12, 68128) Others, also friendly, have with equal earnestness asked me to go.
('53', 33, 4, 13, 68195) Now comes an extremely well reasoned appeal from a countryman residing in America 2. It deals with three matters of importance.
('53', 33, 4, 14, 68323) But I must let the letter speak for itself of which the relevant portion is given below: 3
('53', 33, 5, 15, 68414) I venture to make an humble suggestion and that is to request you to give up your idea of visiting the United States of America.
('53', 33, 6, 16, 68543) I will venture to put in a couple of reasons as to why I think your visit to the United States will serve no useful purpose where our national affairs are concerned.
('53', 33, 7, 17, 68709) This country is a very peculiar country in many respects and the Americans as a rule are so materialistically inclined, and this fact is more or less conceded by all, that they can hardly see anything in terms other than dollars and cents.
('53', 33, 8, 18, 68949) Of course this is a broad statement to make and I fully realize that there are exceptions here and there.
('53', 33, 9, 19, 69055) Your visit to this country, in my opinion, will be absolutely misunder stood and if I am not mistaken the wonderful hold that you have today on some of the imaginative Americans, will be lost in a way.
('53', 33, 9, 20, 69257) And I am further of the opinion that your visit to America instead of enlisting greater sympathy for our national cause may work quite the other way.
('53', 33, 10, 21, 69407) Hardly anyone could come to this country and travel about and give a

('53', 34, 1, 2, 69643) few lectures here and there without having a business manager.
('53', 34, 1, 3, 69706) That will make your visit a business one and there will be scores of sections of people and Press who will criticize your visit and suggest that you came here to make money.
('53', 34, 2, 4, 69880) Probably you are aware of the fact that such a noble soul and true philosopher like Tagore has been openly criticized in American papers and insinuations have been made that he visits America to make money out of the Americans and yet has the cheek to criticize the so called civilization or lack of it in this country.
('53', 34, 3, 5, 70200) In other words I feel that not on account of anything that you may say or do, but on account of the mentality of an average American, you are bound to be misunderstood in this country and thus your visit is likely to prove more a failure than a success.
('53', 34, 4, 6, 70454) Therefore my conclusions are based upon the information that I have gathered from time to time from an average well to do American family, whose interest is casual in what is happening in India, and as I have said before, such Americans are in greater numbers than anti or proIndian Americans.
('53', 34, 5, 7, 70748) Your visit to London is entirely a different thing.
('53', 34, 5, 8, 70800) In my humble
('53', 34, 6, 9, 70813) opinion it will serve a great purpose, because if there is any nation on this
('53', 34, 7, 10, 70891) world who is truly sportsmanlike and will give the devil his due, it is the
('53', 34, 8, 11, 70967) English nation.
('53', 34, 9, 12, 70983) I have also a word to add regarding this much talked of question of your
('53', 34, 10, 13, 71056) attire when visiting England or America.
('53', 34, 11, 14, 71097) It will be simply ironical if you could not find some form of Indian
('53', 34, 12, 15, 71166) dress which may be quite suitable and desirable.
('53', 34, 12, 16, 71215) None of the three things worry me.
('53', 34, 12, 17, 71250) The proposal to visit America has been with me for the past five years or longer.
('53', 34, 12, 18, 71332) But I have lacked the inner urge or courage to go.
('53', 34, 12, 19, 71383) The very allurements some of the writers have held out have but confirmed the original decision based on nothing better than intuition.
('53', 34, 12, 20, 71519) The same is true of the English visit more or less.
('53', 34, 12, 21, 71571) There, too, if I am to go the way will be clear and open for me.
('53', 34, 12, 22, 71636) At the present moment the subtle and growing resistance to the Delhi Pact by the officials leaves me no room for thinking of anything else.
('53', 34, 12, 23, 71776) My contribution to the movement of Indias freedom just now consists in making every effort humanly possible to prevent the Settlement from being wrecked.
('53', 34, 12, 24, 71930) As to the dress I have had many advisers.
('53', 34, 12, 25, 71972) But here too my position is simple.
('53', 34, 12, 26, 72008) If I go to England I shall go as a representative and
('53', 35, 0, 1, 72062) 36 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 35, 1, 2, 72103) nothing more, nothing less.
('53', 35, 1, 3, 72131) I must, therefore, appear not as the English would have me but as my representative character demands.
('53', 35, 1, 4, 72234) I represent the Congress because and in so far as it represents Daridranarayana, the semi starved almost naked villager.
('53', 35, 1, 5, 72355) And if I represent the landed or monied or educated Indians, I do so to the extent that they identify themselves with Daridranarayana and desire to promote his interest.
('53', 35, 1, 6, 72525) I can therefore appear neither in English costume nor in that of the polished Nehrus.
('53', 35, 1, 7, 72611) In spite of the closest bond between us it would have been just as ludicrous for me to dress as Pandit Motilalji did as it would have been for him to appear in loin cloth.
('53', 35, 1, 8, 72783) My loin cloth is an organic evolution in my life.
('53', 35, 1, 9, 72833) It came naturally, without effort, without premeditation.
('53', 35, 1, 10, 72891) My duty, as I conceive it, will then be, if I succeed in reaching London, to add nothing more to the loin cloth than the climate peremptorily demands.
('53', 35, 1, 11, 73042) I should be guilty of discourtesy to the English if I deceived them by appearing not as I am but as I may think or friends may think they would have me to be.
('53', 35, 1, 12, 73201) I should fail at the very beginning of my mission, if I commenced by deception.
('53', 35, 1, 13, 73281) It may please for the time being, it must offend in the end.
('53', 35, 1, 14, 73342) If I am to win their hearts as I want to, I can do so only by being cent per cent truthful.
('53', 35, 1, 15, 73434) Truth is like the sun.
('53', 35, 1, 16, 73457) It will melt the icy mountain of suspicion and distrust.

('53', 35, 5, 20, 73594) I have known of this case for a long time.
('53', 35, 5, 21, 73637) It does appear to be an extremely hard and deserving case.
('53', 35, 5, 22, 73696) Generally a life sentence means fourteen years.
('53', 35, 5, 23, 73744) Why in this case that period has not sufficed the public are entitled to know.
('53', 35, 5, 24, 73823) If it is true as stated by the correspondent that Pandit Jagat Ram bears an exemplary character and is ailing, it is surely an additional reason for his discharge.
('53', 35, 5, 25, 73987) The recent death of his father makes the case for discharge complete from a humanitarian

('53', 38, 10, 20, 78352) I am helpless, I am so busy.
('53', 38, 10, 21, 78381) When one is bed ridden, people do not expect him to pay them visits, they flock round his bed.

('53', 39, 1, 4, 78895) Now a word of warning.
('53', 39, 1, 5, 78918) You have started an independent organization.
('53', 39, 1, 6, 78964) It is up to you to see that you do not embark on any activity in the name of the Congress without first obtaining the permission of the Congress.
('53', 39, 1, 7, 79110) Similarly particular care would have to be taken to see that there is no conflict or overlapping of activities.
('53', 39, 1, 8, 79222) Khaddar work is dear to me and that is why while giving my blessings to the Mandal that has attached itself to this work, I have thought fit to utter a necessary note of warning.

('53', 39, 4, 12, 79503) DEAR PRINCIPAL SHIRRAS, You will please forgive me for my inability to acknowledge your letter 1 earlier.
('53', 39, 4, 13, 79609) I have been so engrossed in work here as to be unable to keep pace with my correspondence.
('53', 39, 4, 14, 79700) I had no notion that my last letter was delivered to you with the envelope unclosed.
('53', 39, 4, 15, 79785) I quite recognize the force of your argument that my letter should not have been delivered through the very students whose cases were under consideration.
('53', 39, 4, 16, 79940) I thank you for your exhaustive reply.
('53', 39, 4, 17, 79979) Having regard to the detailed information you have given to me, I have advised the students, who have not been admitted, to cease agitating for admission, and I have every hope that they will accept my advice.
('53', 39, 4, 18, 80189) I return the papers you were kind enough to send me.

('53', 40, 1, 2, 80445) 42. CULTIVATORS ACCOUNT BOOK
('53', 40, 2, 3, 80474) There is no limit to the cultivators carelessness or ignorance.
('53', 40, 2, 4, 80538) Not only do they themselves have to suffer for their ignorance, but it results in a loss of crores of rupees as the cultivators constitute more than 80% of Indias population.
('53', 40, 2, 5, 80713) The most serious aspect of their carelessness is perhaps their indifference to keeping accounts.
('53', 40, 2, 6, 80810) If a merchant kept no books of account, he would soon become bankrupt.
('53', 40, 2, 7, 80881) A house holder would become poor if he went on spending without keeping an account of his expenditure.
('53', 40, 2, 8, 80984) Even Lord Kuberas 1 treasure would soon be exhausted if he went on spending from it without keeping an account.
('53', 40, 2, 9, 81096) How, then, can the cultivator escape?
('53', 40, 2, 10, 81134) But it is a fact universally known that the Indian cultivator carries his account in his memory and never enters it in a book.
('53', 40, 2, 11, 81261) As a result, he is always in debt, and, though no one has been able to gather the full statistics, it is estimated that his debt runs into crores or hundreds of crores of rupees.
('53', 40, 2, 12, 81440) This means that the cultivator has been carrying on his occupation at a loss.
('53', 40, 2, 13, 81518) To remedy this deficiency, a proforma book of accounts has been advised by the Vidyapith and made available.
('53', 40, 2, 14, 81627) The book is based on the experiences of Mahadev and Narahari during the Bardoli Satyagraha.
('53', 40, 2, 15, 81719) The type of information which they often required at that time can be gathered from this book whenever one wants it.
('53', 40, 2, 16, 81836) The book has been so designed that the farmer also should be able to know his position from day to day.
('53', 40, 2, 17, 81940) This book is not intended for free distribution.
('53', 40, 2, 18, 81989) Only a cultivator who wishes to keep accounts should buy it.
('53', 40, 2, 19, 82050) It will be sold at cost price, and volunteers trained for the purpose will explain how to use it to persons who may not know how to keep accounts.
('53', 40, 2, 20, 82197) As for those cultivators who do not know how to read or write, wherever possible a volunteer will write their accounts for them.
('53', 40, 2, 21, 82326) I would advise every cultivator to acquire enough knowledge of Gujarati language to be able to keep his accounts.
('53', 40, 2, 22, 82440) The volunteer will help him in that too.
('53', 40, 2, 23, 82481) Though a cultivator may not just now be able to realize the benefit of keeping accounts in this manner, he will discover at the end of the

('53', 41, 18, 22, 83692) You will understand that, in the absence of specific information regarding the alleged breaches of the Settlement by Government, it is not possible for me to propose particular remedies I suggest that, as on previous occasions when difficulties have arisen, the best course is a personal discussion of mutual complaints.
('53', 41, 18, 23, 84013) I should be very glad to see you if you could visit Simla, and to arrange for detailed discussion between you and Emerson.
('53', 41, 18, 24, 84136) In the mean time you will no doubt agree with me that it is undesirable that anything should be published by either side which might make it more difficult to obtain a solution of the existing difficulties.

('53', 42, 2, 3, 84437) Asked if the formula 1 suggested by the Working Committee for a settlement of the communal question was unacceptable to Maulana Shaukat Alis party and if an alternative formulae acceptable to all parties was not forthcoming, whether the Congress would press its own formulae at the Round Table Conference or would agree to arbitration, Mr. Gandhi remarked: This is more than I can answer at the present moment.

('53', 43, 3, 27, 86621) If this oneness was not a fact, we would not have been blessed with the capacity to forget the death of dearest ones.

('53', 46, 5, 23, 90766) The purpose of the vow to work outside the Ashram is that we should make greater self sacrifices and do more work.
('53', 46, 5, 24, 90881) If living outside the Ashram makes workers lazy and self indulgent, the vow will be kept by returning to the Ashram.
('53', 46, 5, 25, 90998) One ought not to return to the Ashram for selfish reasons.
('53', 46, 5, 26, 91057) That is, you cannot return for Chandras sake, just as Rama cannot do so for Vimus sake.
('53', 46, 5, 27, 91145) I would like it if Chandra stays without you in the Ashram.
('53', 46, 5, 28, 91205) Or, if practicable, you may keep Chandra there with you.
('53', 46, 5, 29, 91262) But you should not keep him with you if his presence hinders you in your work.
('53', 46, 5, 30, 91341) Do you now understand what I mean?
('53', 46, 5, 31, 91376) If you dont, write again and ask me.
('53', 46, 5, 32, 91413) You should understand the reasons for whatever you do.
('53', 46, 5, 33, 91468) I shall be in Simla for three or four days.
('53', 46, 5, 34, 91512) I expect to return to Borsad or Bardoli on the 21st.
('53', 46, 5, 35, 91565) What effect did the fast have?

('53', 47, 2, 3, 91724) ON THE TRAIN, July 14, 1931
('53', 47, 3, 4, 91752) LILAVATI, I got your letters.
('53', 47, 3, 5, 91782) What should I write to you?
('53', 47, 3, 6, 91810) How may I soothe you?
('53', 47, 3, 7, 91832) What Narandas says is not because of distrust, but out of regard for propriety.
('53', 47, 3, 8, 91912) Even I should not be alone with any person.
('53', 47, 3, 9, 91956) I do many things for proprietys sake, though I would not consider it wrong, either, to do them of my own free will.
('53', 47, 3, 10, 92072) The whole world acts in that manner.
('53', 47, 3, 11, 92109) If you examine your own actions, you will discover that you do a great many thingsfor the sake of propriety.
('53', 47, 3, 12, 92218) Give up all thought of going to Bombay.
('53', 47, 3, 13, 92258) Instead of acting on all our impulses, we ought to suppress those that are bad.
('53', 47, 3, 14, 92338) I am going to Simla.
('53', 47, 3, 15, 92359) I intend to visit Ahmedabad after I return from there.

('53', 47, 7, 19, 92505) [Before July 15, 1931] 1
('53', 47, 8, 20, 92530) I cannot say even now if I am going to England.
('53', 47, 8, 21, 92578) I should know it in Simla.
('53', 47, 9, 22, 92605) Mahatmaji said that he had not booked his passage for London so far.
('53', 47, 9, 23, 92674) It was true that someone else had booked for him but he had sent a letter to the P. & O. Company asking that the same be cancelled.
('53', 47, 9, 24, 92806) The Company had informed him that in case booking was delayed, space in the s.s.
('53', 47, 9, 25, 92887) Mooltan, may become overcrowded.
('53', 47, 9, 26, 92920) Mahatmaji had, however, said that he would take his chance.
('53', 47, 10, 27, 92980) The correspondent then showed Gandhiji a copy of The Statesman in which the special representative of that paper had expressed the view that Mahatma Gandhi had asked the Government to increase the Congress delegation to the Round Table Conference and was insisting on having some members of the Nationalist Muslim group included in that delegation.
('53', 47, 11, 28, 93329) 1 From the reference in the first paragraph to Simla which Gandhiji reached on the 15th
('53', 48, 0, 1, 93417) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 49
('53', 48, 1, 2, 93460) Mahatma Gandhi said that the report in question was a tissue of falsehoods.
('53', 48, 1, 3, 93536) He said: It does not injure my reputation, but my heart is injured to find that responsible journalists utter such palpable falsehoods.
('53', 48, 2, 4, 93672) Gandhiji further said that there are persons who are determined to wreck the Truce and were carrying on such propaganda but he did not mind this, as it did not hurt him.
('53', 48, 2, 5, 93842) He said smilingly: In fact I flourish on this propaganda.
('53', 48, 2, 6, 93900) This news is absurd and I know how these lies are manufactured.
('53', 48, 2, 7, 93964) These things, however, diminish the estimation in which journalism should be held.
('53', 48, 2, 8, 94047) If my intention were to ask the Viceroy for additional nominations, I would have proclaimed this from the housetops.
('53', 48, 3, 9, 94164) He said he was very sorry that English journalists were not playing the game, and were indulging in a vicious type of propaganda.
('53', 48, 4, 10, 94294) Asked if he will be taking some advisers, Mahatmaji said: My adviser is God.
('53', 48, 4, 11, 94371) I am going to take no advisers.
('53', 48, 4, 12, 94403) If I had any idea to take advisers, I would have taken them as dele gates.
('53', 48, 5, 13, 94478) Mahatmaji said the position with regard to Congress representation at the Round Table Conference was exactly the same as at Karachi, and Mahatmaji thought it was a most proper decision.
('53', 48, 5, 14, 94664) In conclusion, he said: I would take with me my son Devdas Gandhi, Mahadev Desai, Pyarelal, Miss Slade and none else.

('53', 48, 8, 18, 94911) Gandhiji said to me when I accosted him on his return from Mr. Emersons residence this afternoon after three hours conversations: 1
('53', 48, 9, 19, 95043) He added: I am afraid my stay may have to be prolonged till Sunday.
('53', 48, 10, 20, 95111) He could not say whether Pandit Jawaharlal and Mr. Patel would visit Simla.
('53', 48, 10, 21, 95187) He was also unable to say if a communal agreement would be reached before he sailed for England but added:

('53', 49, 2, 3, 95419) Asked if he was taking any advisers to London, he replied: God is my adviser general.
('53', 49, 3, 4, 95505) His conversations with Mr. Emerson this afternoon solely related to the alleged breaches of Delhi Pact committed by officials in various provinces particu larly in Gujarat, the United Provinces, the Punjab and Kerala.
('53', 49, 4, 5, 95723) Gandhiji also emphatically denied the report, published in some papers, that among the subjects he would discuss with the Viceroy would be one relating to further representation at the Round Table Conference.

('53', 49, 7, 8, 95974) LIQUOR DEALERS BEWARE
('53', 49, 8, 9, 95996) Auctions for liquor licences are now in season.
('53', 49, 8, 10, 96044) In the face of what I have already published it is too much to expect local authorities to stop auctions or restrict them.
('53', 49, 8, 11, 96167) But is it too much to expect liqour dealers to foresee the future?
('53', 49, 8, 12, 96234) They ought to know that prohibition of liquor and foreign cloth is the permanent policy of the nation?
('53', 49, 8, 13, 96337) The one is a moral necessity, the other is an economic necessity.
('53', 49, 8, 14, 96403) Both produce political results.
('53', 49, 8, 15, 96435) But they are a by product.
('53', 49, 8, 16, 96462) Picketing no doubt of the most peaceful character will continue without remission till the State is converted to the policy of prohibition.
('53', 49, 8, 17, 96602) It is an effective method of education.
('53', 49, 9, 18, 96642) SALT CONCESSION
('53', 49, 10, 19, 96658) I hear that in Mirpur and Kalabagh in the salt range the people having abused the salt concession under the Delhi Pact, it has been withdrawn by the Government.
('53', 49, 10, 20, 96819) The people are reported to have carried maunds of salt on camel back.
('53', 49, 10, 21, 96889) If such was the case, it was a distinct breach of the Settlement.
('53', 49, 10, 22, 96955) Whether the action taken by the Government is not too drastic for the breach, it is difficult to judge without a fuller knowledge of facts.
('53', 49, 10, 23, 97095) News comes from Madras that people in a salt area were found to be carrying salt on carts.
('53', 49, 10, 24, 97186) They were prosecuted.
('53', 49, 10, 25, 97208) The carrying on carts was undoubtedly wrong.
('53', 49, 10, 26, 97253) Here again the question whether a warning would not have sufficed cannot be decided without knowing all the facts.
('53', 49, 10, 27, 97368) Responsible Congressmen can help me by sending me accurate information.
('53', 49, 10, 28, 97440) Let me repeat that the concession applies only to villagers making salt for domestic
('53', 50, 0, 1, 97525) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 51
('53', 50, 1, 2, 97568) consumption and selling among themselves, walking distance being the limit of the area.
('53', 50, 1, 3, 97656) Naturally no other than human transport can be permitted under this concession.
('53', 50, 1, 4, 97736) Not even a handcart may be used.
('53', 50, 1, 5, 97769) Salt must be carried on ones back or head.
('53', 50, 1, 6, 97812) On the Government side one would expect a reasonable warning of breaches before action is taken.
('53', 50, 1, 7, 97909) Where crores of poor ignorant villagers are concerned, it is not to be expected that they would have an accurate idea of regulations that may be made from time to time.
('53', 50, 1, 8, 98078) I should be surprised, if it was found that either in the North or in the South the villagers had wilfully broken the understanding.
('53', 50, 1, 9, 98211) Anyway let Congressmen beware.
('53', 50, 1, 10, 98242) They should give exact instructions to the villagers within their respective areas.
('53', 50, 2, 11, 98326) UNWARRANTED USE
('53', 50, 3, 12, 98342) A correspondent draws my attention to the fact that in the South the local authorities have made an illegitimate use of the suggestion I made some weeks ago 1 that not more than five picketers may be posted at one place.
('53', 50, 3, 13, 98563) The authorities in some places in the South have promptly notified that not more than five picketers may be employed under any circumstance.
('53', 50, 3, 14, 98704) Thus in many places nowadays at liquor shops that have more than one entrance, no more than five picketers are permitted.
('53', 50, 3, 15, 98826) According to my formula there would be not more than five for every entrance.
('53', 50, 3, 16, 98904) Even for one entrance I can conceive the necessity of having more than five picketers.
('53', 50, 3, 17, 98991) The number would depend upon the situation of the shop.
('53', 50, 4, 18, 99047) CONGRESS VOLUNTEERS
('53', 50, 5, 19, 99067) The Working Committee has never before sat as long as it did last week 2 except when the Delhi negotiations were going on.
('53', 50, 5, 20, 99190) A glance at all the resolutions passed at the meeting will show that the time was not wasted.
('53', 50, 5, 21, 99284) Add to these the fruitful and very necessary long hours it gave to the many complaints about the Settlement.
('53', 50, 5, 22, 99393) Next in importance to the communal resolution was the one regarding volunteers.
('53', 50, 5, 23, 99473) Hindustani Seva Dal becomes a Congress organization.
('53', 50, 5, 24, 99526) Its function is defined.
('53', 50, 5, 25, 99551) Volunteer organizations will now not grow up anyhow.
('53', 50, 5, 26, 99604) Indiscipline will not be tolerated if the Provincial Congress Committees will do their duty.

('53', 51, 1, 2, 99805) Committee will no longer be satisfied with merely making a yearly grant to an organization it did not know.
('53', 51, 1, 3, 99913) It will through its last years President overhaul the organization and through it supply trained officers and instructions to the Provincial organizations who will in all other respects be absolutely autonomous and free from restrictions.
('53', 51, 1, 4, 100152) But no constitution will ensure discipline and efficiency, if the will is lacking.
('53', 51, 1, 5, 100235) Here is the resolution as passed by the Working Committee:
('53', 51, 2, 6, 100294) In view of misapprehensions that have arisen in regard to the relation of the Hindustani Seva Dal with the Congress and in view of the fact that unauthorized volunteer organizations are working in various parts of the country in the name of the Congress, the Working Committee resolves that1. The Hindustani Seva Dal is hereby recognized as the Central Volunteer Organization of the Congress, working directly under the authority of the Working Committee or such person or persons as it may appoint in this behalf, and with the following functions:
('53', 51, 3, 7, 100843) (a) It shall act as a duly authorized institution for the training of officers and instructors.
('53', 51, 4, 8, 100939) (b) It shall enrol and train recruits in Karnatak, or such other place as may be determined by the Working Committee from time to time and these will form a permanent Central Corps for officers training and will be liable to serve wherever necessary.
('53', 51, 4, 9, 101190) It may also have training centres and camps for officers and instructors in other suitable places.
('53', 51, 5, 10, 101289) (c) It shall lend the services of officers and instructors for provinces at the latters expense.
('53', 51, 6, 11, 101386) (d) It shall have power to form volunteer corps in provinces wherever
('53', 51, 7, 12, 101456) so required by Provincial Congress Committees.
('53', 51, 8, 13, 101503) 2. All Provincial Congress Committees are hereby authorized and
('53', 51, 9, 14, 101567) required to form duly recognized volunteer corps.
('53', 51, 10, 15, 101617) 3. No such corps shall be recognized unless all the members are
('53', 51, 11, 16, 101681) members of the Congress and conform to the Congress creed and whose
('53', 51, 12, 17, 101749) officers are holders of certificates from the Hindustani Seva Dal.
('53', 51, 13, 18, 101816) 4. No volunteer board or corps not previously recognized by the
('53', 51, 14, 19, 101880) Working Committee shall work in any Congress province in the name of or
('53', 51, 15, 20, 101952) on behalf of the Congress.
('53', 51, 16, 21, 101979) 5. Jawaharlal Nehru is appointed the member in charge on behalf of the Working Committee of the said central volunteer organization of the Congress and N. S. Hardikar, the organizing secretary thereof and they will serve during the pleasure of the Working Committee.

('53', 52, 2, 3, 102711) TAMIL NADU S. A. AND NON BRAHMINS
('53', 52, 3, 4, 102745) Complaints have come to me to the effect that the Spinners Association in Tamil Nadu has been monopolized by Brahmin employees.
('53', 52, 3, 5, 102873) The unprejudiced sceptic may know that recruitment is never being made on grounds of caste but workers are employed purely on grounds of fitness.
('53', 52, 3, 6, 103019) As things stand, there are 53 sale and production centres in Tamil Nadu.
('53', 52, 3, 7, 103092) Of these the managers of 28 are non Brahmins, as against 25 wherein the managers are Brahmins.
('53', 52, 3, 8, 103187) Excluding servants drawing a monthly salary of less than Rs. 15 who are almost all non Brahmins, the salaries paid by the A.I.S.A. in Tamil Nadu are shown below: Rs., 50 and above : 10 Brahmins; 5 non Brahmins.
('53', 52, 3, 9, 103398) Below Rs. 50 : 53 Brahmins; 121 non Brahmins.
('53', 52, 3, 10, 103444) Total : 63 Brahmins; 126 non Brahmins.
('53', 52, 3, 11, 103483) The total amount of the salaries distributed per month among Brahmins is Rs. 2,576; non Brahmins: Rs. 3,102. The total amount disbursed to hands drawing less than Rs. 15 per month is Brahmins:Rs.31; non Brahmins: Rs. 725. Of the ten Brahmin hands drawing salaries over Rs. 50, two have put in a service of over seven years and six have put in a service of five years and over.
('53', 52, 3, 12, 103860) The other two have served three years.
('53', 52, 3, 13, 103899) Of the five non Brahmins drawing salaries over Rs. 50, three have put in five years service and two have put in three years service.
('53', 52, 3, 14, 104032) But for the fact that there is the Brahmin non Brahmin question in the South, I should have declined to publish these statistics.
('53', 52, 3, 15, 104162) The readers in the South should know, if it is of any consequence, that the Association is manned chiefly by non Brahmins, for the chief workers it is a labour of love.
('53', 52, 3, 16, 104331) What is more, it exists purely and simply to serve the dumb and starving millions who are overwhelmingl non Brah mins and include Mussalmans and Christians also.

('53', 53, 7, 10, 105054) It is not our boycott so much as the Japanese efficiency that has ousted British piece goods, and if our mills do not keep pace with the times, notwithstanding all the effort of the Congress to infuse the swadeshi spirit among the people, Japan will win the race.
('53', 53, 7, 11, 105318) A prohibitive duty will not be permitted to protect inefficiency.
('53', 53, 7, 12, 105384) I know that in Japan the people and the State are one.
('53', 53, 7, 13, 105439) But even when we arrive at that state, efficiency will be necessary, perhaps more than now.

('53', 54, 1, 3, 106564) He loves his profession and is content to live for it.
('53', 54, 1, 4, 106619) If one finds him in politics or even as President of the Congress, he is there because friends have dragged him to the position.
('53', 54, 1, 5, 106748) He is too noble and too patriotic to resist them.

('53', 54, 1, 7, 106868) May these efforts be crowned with success!
('53', 54, 1, 8, 106911) Even the noblest of virtues need to incarnate in human flesh before they can act.
('53', 54, 1, 9, 106993) Intrinsically considered, the scheme appears to me to be sound, if the necessity for a communal solution be admitted.
('53', 54, 1, 10, 107111) If we were pure nationalists, no scheme would be required.
('53', 54, 1, 11, 107170) By religion we may be different, as a nation we should be one and indivisible.
('53', 54, 1, 12, 107249) We will choose our legislators and appoint servants for their merits irrespective of their religion or race.
('53', 54, 1, 13, 107358) Judged by that standard, the scheme is a fall.
('53', 54, 1, 14, 107405) But we are fallen.
('53', 54, 1, 15, 107424) We suspect and fear one another and yet we want swaraj, for it is our birth right.
('53', 54, 1, 16, 107507) And so the Congress has offered a compromise.
('53', 54, 1, 17, 107553) Maulana Shaukat Ali when he was with the Working Committee angrily said: Why do you continually ask me what I want?
('53', 54, 1, 18, 107669) I have told you what I want.
('53', 54, 1, 19, 107698) Why dont you tell me what you would give! The sting went home.
('53', 54, 1, 20, 107761) The Congress formulae of pure nationalism was useless.
('53', 54, 1, 21, 107816) His claim to represent Mussalmans as a whole was rejected.
('53', 54, 1, 22, 107875) He was therefore entitled to know what the Congress could offer.
('53', 54, 1, 23, 107940) The Congress could offer nothing that nationalistically inclined Sikhs, Mussalmans and Hindus were not prepared to agree to.
('53', 54, 1, 24, 108065) Hence the subcommittee and then the scheme as hammered into shape by the Working Committee.
('53', 54, 1, 25, 108157) The Working Committee can have no desire to force it down unwilling throats.
('53', 54, 1, 26, 108234) But nationalists belonging to the three communities have now something to work by and upon.
('53', 54, 1, 27, 108326) Let them unobtrusively cultivate opinion in their respective communities.
('53', 54, 1, 28, 108400) I begin with the Hindus.
('53', 54, 1, 29, 108425) We are an overwhelming majority.
('53', 54, 1, 30, 108458) If we feel physically dwarfs before the Mussalman and the Sikh giants, we shall never grow through the legislatures.
('53', 54, 1, 31, 108575) We shall grow by shedding fear, not by straining our limbs.
('53', 54, 1, 32, 108635) Courage has never been known to be a matter of muscle, it is a matter of the heart.
('53', 54, 1, 33, 108719) The toughest muscle has been known to tremble before an imaginary fear.
('53', 54, 1, 34, 108791) It was the heart that set the muscle atrembling.
('53', 54, 1, 35, 108840) Let us take heart and endorse what the Mussalmans and the Sikhs ask.
('53', 54, 1, 36, 108909) This is just, weighed in the scales of ahimsa otherwise spelt love.
('53', 54, 1, 37, 108977) If this scheme results in
('53', 55, 0, 1, 109003) 56 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 55, 1, 2, 109044) opening the eyes of us Hindus, it would be well even though non nationalist Sikhs and Mussalmans may reject it.
('53', 55, 1, 3, 109156) If we accept this scheme without demur, we should be ready to accept any other that may be acceptable to all Sikhs and all Mussalmans.
('53', 55, 1, 4, 109291) But let me not frighten us away from this scheme by pledging ourselves to any other in advance.
('53', 55, 1, 5, 109387) My mind as an individual is made up and has been often expressed.
('53', 55, 1, 6, 109453) But I do dare to ask the Hindus to accept this scheme because it is charged with the blessings of Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviyaji and Sjt.
('53', 55, 1, 7, 109590) Madhavrao Aney, not to speak of the other Hindu members of the Working Committee.
('53', 55, 2, 8, 109672) CONGRESS SCHEME
('53', 55, 3, 9, 109688) However much it may have failed in the realisation, the Congress has, from its very inception, set up pure nationalism as its ideal.
('53', 55, 3, 10, 109821) It has endeavoured to break down communal barriers.
('53', 55, 3, 11, 109873) The following Lahore resolution1 was the culminating point in its advance towards nationalism:
('53', 55, 4, 12, 109968) Hence the Congress is precluded from setting forth any communal solution of the communal problem.
('53', 55, 4, 13, 110066) But at this critical juncture in the history of the nation, it is felt that the Working Committee should suggest for adoption by the country a solution though communal in appearance, yet as nearly national as possible and generally acceptable to the communities concerned.
('53', 55, 4, 14, 110339) The Working Committee therefore after full and free discussion unanimously passed the following scheme:
('53', 55, 5, 15, 110443) I (a) The article in the constitution relating to Fundamental Rights
('53', 55, 6, 16, 110512) shall include a guarantee to the communities concerned of the protection of
('53', 55, 7, 17, 110588) their cultures, languages, scripts, education, profession and practice of
('53', 55, 8, 18, 110662) religion, and religious endowments.
('53', 55, 9, 19, 110698) (b) Personal Laws shall be protected by specific provisions to be
('53', 55, 10, 20, 110764) embodied in the constitutions.
('53', 55, 11, 21, 110795) (c) Protection of political and other rights of minority
('53', 55, 12, 22, 110852) communities in the various provinces shall be the concern and be within the
('53', 55, 13, 23, 110928) jurisdiction of the Federal Government.
('53', 55, 14, 24, 110968) 2. The franchise shall be extended to all adult men and women.
('53', 55, 15, 25, 111031) The Working Committee is committed to adult franchise by the Karachi resolution of the Congress2 and cannot entertain any alter native

('53', 56, 1, 3, 111326) In view, however, of misapprehensions in some quarters the Committee wishes to make it clear that in any event the franchise shall be uniform and so extensive as to reflect in the electoral roll the proportion in the population of every community).
('53', 56, 2, 4, 111575) 3. (a) Joint electorates shall form the basis of representation in the future constitution of India.
('53', 56, 3, 5, 111676) (b) That for the Hindus in Sind, the Muslims in Assam and the Sikhs in the Punjab and N.W.F.P., and for Hindus and Muslims in any province where they are less than 25% of the population, seats shall be reserved in the Federal and Provincial Legislatures on the basis of population with the right to contest additional seats.
('53', 56, 4, 6, 112001) 4. Appointments shall be made by non party Public Service Commissions which shall prescribe the minimum qualification, and which shall have due regard to the efficiency of the Public Service as well as to the principle of equal opportunity to all communities for a fair share in the public services of the country.
('53', 56, 5, 7, 112316) 5. In the formation of Federal and Provincial Cabinets interests of minority communities should be recognized by convention.
('53', 56, 6, 8, 112441) 6. The N.W.F. Province and Baluchistan shall have the same form of government and administration as other provinces.
('53', 56, 7, 9, 112558) 7. Sind shall be constituted into a separate province provided that the people of Sind are prepared to bear the financial burden of the separated province.
('53', 56, 8, 10, 112714) 8. The future constitution of the country shall be federal.
('53', 56, 8, 11, 112774) The residuary powers shall vest in the federating units, unless, on further examination, it is found to be against the best interests of India.
('53', 56, 8, 12, 112918) The Working Committee has adopted the foregoing scheme as a compromise between the proposals based on undiluted communalism and undiluted nationalism.
('53', 56, 8, 13, 113069) Whilst on the one hand the Working Committee hopes that the whole nation will endorse the scheme, on the other, it assures those who take extreme views and cannot adopt it that the Committee will gladly, as it is bound to by the Lahore resolution, accept without reservation any other scheme if it commands the acceptance of all the parties concerned.

('53', 57, 2, 3, 113510) The Working Committee adopted the following pledge for the guidance of foreign cloth merchants and Congress workers:
('53', 57, 3, 4, 113627) Resolved that any pledge in connection with exclusion of foreign cloth and yarn inconsistent with the following pledge shall be held to be invalid:
('53', 57, 4, 5, 113775) We pledge ourselves that we shall observe the following conditions so long as the Working Committee of the Congress does not give express permission by resolution to do otherwise:
('53', 57, 5, 6, 113955) 1. We undertake not to purchase or sell any foreign yarn made from cotton, wool or silk or cloth manufactured from such yarn.
('53', 57, 6, 7, 114081) 2. We undertake not to purchase or sell any yarn or cloth manu factured by mills that have not accepted the Congress conditions.
('53', 57, 7, 8, 114210) 3. We undertake not to sell in this country any foreign yarn or silk or wool or cloth manufactured from such yarn or silk or wool that may be lying with us.
('53', 57, 7, 9, 114367) All concerned will note that this pledge supersedes all the pledges that have been accepted haphazard by Congress workers or organizations.
('53', 57, 7, 10, 114507) Merchants should make up their minds that this exclusion of foreign cloth is not a temporary affair.
('53', 57, 7, 11, 114608) They must either take to swadeshi cloth trade, better still khadi or find some other occupation consistent with the national interest.

('53', 57, 9, 13, 114766) 62. SOME POSERS
('53', 57, 10, 14, 114782) Here are some posers for lovers of khaddar:
('53', 57, 11, 15, 114826) Will you kindly explain to me how the resolution passed at Karachi Congress in connection with khadi propaganda is going to help that object?
('53', 57, 11, 16, 114968) The indigenous mill owners have been appealed to give their moral support to the supplementary village industry of hand spinning by themselves using hand spun.
('53', 57, 11, 17, 115128) Now if the mill owners enjoy the unrestricted privilege of carrying on their present mills with a view to develop them, will the mere use of hand spun be construed into moral support to khaddar?
('53', 57, 11, 18, 115323) In my humble opinion there is no moral support unless mill owners discover the antagonism between mill and charkha and honestly try graduallyto restrict their activity.
('53', 57, 11, 19, 115492) Then it passes ones comprehension how khaddar can hold its own if mills go on
('53', 58, 0, 1, 115570) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 59
('53', 58, 1, 2, 115613) producing finer and cheaper stuff to be used in place of khaddar.
('53', 58, 1, 3, 115679) Then again, asking the mill owners to keep down the prices of cloths will be a sure means of killing khaddar.
('53', 58, 1, 4, 115789) These are all good questions.
('53', 58, 1, 5, 115819) There is no doubt that if the personal use by mill owners of khaddar is not a token of their inner conviction it is of no use and may well be a token of hypocrisy.
('53', 58, 1, 6, 115983) If there is inner conviction they will conduct their mills so as never to harm khaddar even as a gardener so disposes his hardy plants as not to harm saplings.
('53', 58, 1, 7, 116143) The Congress toleration of mills is based on the belief that the mills can serve a useful purpose during the transition stage.
('53', 58, 1, 8, 116270) Immediate exclusion of foreign cloth becomes easier through the indigenous mills if they work in sympathy with the movement.
('53', 58, 1, 9, 116395) It is easier for khaddar to deal and compete with the indigenous mills alone than to do so with them plus English, Japanese, Italian and other mills.
('53', 58, 1, 10, 116545) The increase in the number of indigenous mills need not frighten khaddarites.
('53', 58, 1, 11, 116623) The increase is no doubt proof that the econo mic influence of khaddar is not yet fully felt.
('53', 58, 1, 12, 116717) When khaddar becomes universal, many mills may find their occupation gone.
('53', 58, 1, 13, 116792) It is needless to speculate whether khaddar will obtain such a hold on the people.
('53', 58, 1, 14, 116875) It will depend upon the faithfulness of the workers.
('53', 58, 1, 15, 116928) There is no flaw in the reasoning applied to khaddar.
('53', 58, 1, 16, 116982) It is merely a question of giving a true education to the millions of villagers, of changing national taste, of realizing the tremendous power of the wheel to banish pauperism from the land.
('53', 58, 1, 17, 117173) It is no small thing to be able to show a way the adop tion of which will be an insurance against starvation and its attendant results.
('53', 58, 1, 18, 117309) As to the second poser, the necessity of the mills producing finer cloths cannot be questioned.
('53', 58, 1, 19, 117405) In the khaddar age the people had fine khaddar.
('53', 58, 1, 20, 117453) It is produced even now but not in such quantity, not so cheap as to be available to all who desire it.
('53', 58, 1, 21, 117557) Again therefore during the transition stage the mills may be encouraged to manufacture fine cloths.
('53', 58, 1, 22, 117657) And it is easy enough to see that restriction of mill production to finer counts is wholly beneficial to khaddar.
('53', 58, 1, 23, 117771) The pity of it is that the mills do not respond sufficiently to the national demand.
('53', 58, 1, 24, 117856) Lastly as to the prices.
('53', 58, 1, 25, 117881) Surely the writer does not suggest that mills should charge high prices in order to let khaddar live.
('53', 58, 1, 26, 117983) As the author of the revival of khaddar I must confess that it never entered my head that I should wish for high prices of mill manufactures for the protection of khaddar.
('53', 58, 1, 27, 118155) It is one thing to seek protection against
('53', 59, 0, 1, 118198) 60 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 59, 1, 2, 118239) killing competition, wholly another to wish for higher prices of commodities produced by a few for many even for the protection of an analogous industry.
('53', 59, 1, 3, 118393) Khaddar economics is wholly different from the ordinary.
('53', 59, 1, 4, 118450) The latter takes no note of the human factor.
('53', 59, 1, 5, 118496) The former wholly concerns itself with the human.
('53', 59, 1, 6, 118546) The latter is frankly selfish, the former necessarily unselfish.
('53', 59, 1, 7, 118611) Competition and therefore prices are eliminated from the conception of khaddar.
('53', 59, 1, 8, 118691) There is no competition between hotels and domestic kitchens.
('53', 59, 1, 9, 118753) It never enters into the head of the queen of the house to calculate the cost of her labour, the floor space, etc.
('53', 59, 1, 10, 118868) She simply knows that to conduct the domestic kitchen is as much her duty as it is to bring up children.
('53', 59, 1, 11, 118973) If she were to count the cost, the logic of facts will irresistibly drive her to the destruction of her kitchen as well as her children.
('53', 59, 1, 12, 119110) Some have done both.
('53', 59, 1, 13, 119131) But thank God the cult makes no promise of appreciable increase.
('53', 59, 1, 14, 119196) It is our innate laziness which prevents us from seeing that we sinned against Indian humanity when we destroyed the domestic wheel.
('53', 59, 1, 15, 119329) Let us repent of our sin and return to the peace giving wheel.

('53', 59, 5, 19, 119463) I have your letter; and thank you.
('53', 59, 5, 20, 119498) Miss Mayo, .
('53', 59, 5, 21, 119511) is our national disgrace in the field of literature.
('53', 59, 5, 22, 119564) But, many Americans uphold her; many quote her; .
('53', 59, 5, 23, 119614) That will give you one line on our brand of the satanic civilization, which to Katherine Mayo is the best of all civilizations.
('53', 59, 6, 24, 119742) Here is another light, .
('53', 59, 6, 25, 119767) and line.
('53', 59, 6, 26, 119777) I went to the News Reel Theatre to see and hear you in the Talkies.
('53', 59, 7, 27, 119845) Immediately following was the Air Parade of last Saturday,that dreadful gesture to the world, which says We are ready (and doubtless, willing) to fight you by the most approved methods.
('53', 59, 8, 28, 120031) There were manoeuvres of our West Point Cadetsthe leaders of our future murderers of the battle field; field practice of the cavalry of some European country; andlast but not least in sordidness and sensationalisma representation of a leg show featuring some pretty (?) girls, .
('53', 59, 8, 29, 120310) this phase being also featured in this programme which began with your conversation in far off Sabarmati.
('53', 59, 8, 30, 120416) When you again refer toWestern civilization as satanic,

('53', 60, 1, 3, 120645) Thanks be, there is a better and finer side; there is idealism and humanity and a love of peace and goodwill, but it is so small a side of the entity that is our country.
('53', 60, 2, 4, 120816) In great measure our civilization such as it isis due to the capitalist system, the exploitation of humanity for the benefit of the few  the privilegedthe system of the haves that labour not, and the havenots that labour unceasingly.
('53', 60, 3, 5, 121050) And I hope that India may profit by our errorsour sins of omission and commissionI think she will.
('53', 60, 3, 6, 121149) This must be read with care.
('53', 60, 3, 7, 121178) There is no doubt that Miss Watsons picture is predominantly true.
('53', 60, 3, 8, 121245) But as she admits, there is the bright side too.

('53', 60, 7, 12, 121366) MY DEAR CHARLIE, Last week I asked Pyarelal to give you a few lines.
('53', 60, 7, 13, 121435) I am today in Simla trying to tide over the difficulties that have arisen about the Settlement.
('53', 60, 7, 14, 121531) My coming to London now depends upon what is done here.
('53', 60, 7, 15, 121587) If matters are not satisfactorily settled, naturally there is no question of my going.
('53', 60, 7, 16, 121674) You must have seen from Young India what is happening here.
('53', 60, 7, 17, 121734) If it was small matters, I should not worry.
('53', 60, 7, 18, 121779) I write this however regarding my stay in London if I reach as far.
('53', 60, 7, 19, 121847) The Indian Chamber of Commerce and Congress Indians have sent me long cables insisting on my staying with them.
('53', 60, 7, 20, 121959) The Congress members have suggested Arya Bhavan.
('53', 60, 7, 21, 122008) I have cabled to the Indian Chamber saying that the Reception Committee should decide and I have asked them to see you.
('53', 60, 7, 22, 122128) You will now do whatever you think is necessary.
('53', 60, 7, 23, 122177) Personally I think that it would be better for me to be with Muriel Lester.
('53', 60, 7, 24, 122253) There I should come in touch with the poor of the East End, know something of life in the East End and probably serve the cause better, being in those surroundings.
('53', 60, 7, 25, 122418) But I have no clear notion as to what is best.
('53', 60, 7, 26, 122465) Since dictating this I got your cable.

('53', 62, 3, 4, 123749) Interviewed by the Associated Press special representative, Gandhiji declared: My conversation with Sir James Crerar 1 was perfectly cordial.
('53', 62, 3, 5, 123891) It was in continuation of my talks with Mr. Emerson, Home Secretary.
('53', 62, 3, 6, 123960) In both the cases it was all about the Delhi Pact.
('53', 62, 3, 7, 124011) The third and last of the series of my talks at Simla will be with the Viceroy tomorrow, after which I may be in a position to communicate something to you.
('53', 62, 4, 8, 124168) Asked as regards the spirit of the talk at Ava Lodge 2 as compared with that at Mr. Emersons residence, Mahatma Gandhi replied: Just some variations with the variations of the weather.
('53', 62, 5, 9, 124353) Is there any proposal to set up a committee to watch the working of the Pact in the event of your going to London?
('53', 62, 5, 10, 124468) There is no need for it.
('53', 62, 5, 11, 124493) From the Congress point of view there is the Working Committee.
('53', 62, 5, 12, 124557) In fact, regarding this Pact I have always consulted the Working Committee.

('53', 62, 6, 15, 124977) Mahatma Gandhi replied: It is both likely as well as unlikely.
('53', 62, 6, 16, 125040) Perhaps, I might put it, in military language, as as you were.

('53', 63, 7, 8, 125524) DEAR FRIEND, At one time I thought that I would publish your letter 2 in Young India and deal with it.
('53', 63, 7, 9, 125627) But on a second reading of your letter I have come to the conclusion that the cases, such as you mention, not being of common occurrence, I should give you a private reply.
('53', 63, 7, 10, 125800) The two families excommunicated should boldly face excom munication and suffer the consequences.
('53', 63, 7, 11, 125897) As reformers they will form new ties and having broken the caste barrier, they will have ample compensation in kindred reformers helping them on occasions of marriage or mourning.
('53', 63, 7, 12, 126077) And if side by side with this indifference, they would remain courteous towards the persecutors it would be found that the edge of persecution will lose its sharpness.

('53', 64, 2, 3, 126497) July 18, 1931 My attention has been drawn to a leaderette in The Times of India dated the 15th instant, in which Mr. S. W. Powell, writing in The Daily Telegraph (London) of 13th June is reported to have said that Gandhi himself was not quite the ascetic he is now, for when I met the pair (Mr. Gandhi and his partner a Hindu) in Durban afterwards, we had at least two whiskies in the nearest bar.
('53', 64, 2, 4, 126895) I am sorry The Times of India, in view of the many misrepresentations current about me, has printed what is a palpable falsehood without referring the quotation to me for verification.
('53', 64, 2, 5, 127080) I remember Mr. Powell, as a member of the European Ambulance Corps and I regret to have to say about his statement that it contains a double falsehood.
('53', 64, 2, 6, 127232) My companion was not a Hindu but Mussalman.
('53', 64, 2, 7, 127276) I never entered any bar in South Africa, and I have never entered any bar anywhere throughout my life.
('53', 64, 2, 8, 127379) What is more, Indians are not allowed to enter European bars in Natal and a European would consider it beneath his dignity to enter an Indian bar no matter how thirsty he might feel.

('53', 64, 5, 12, 127642) Mahatma Gandhi said at the gate of the Viceregal Lodge as he emerged after his 3 hours interview with the Viceroy: The temperature remains the same unless it goes down or goes up.
('53', 64, 5, 13, 127822) What can I say?
('53', 64, 5, 14, 127838) The situation is just as it was before.
('53', 64, 6, 15, 127878) He further stated that he was likely to see the Viceroy again since their conversations had not yet concluded.
('53', 64, 6, 16, 127989) Gandhiji said that his stay consequently was likely to be prolonged up to Wednesday.
('53', 64, 7, 17, 128074) Asked as to what was discussed betweeen him and the Viceroy, Gandhiji said: Naturally the Pact.
('53', 64, 8, 18, 128170) Asked about the next interview, the Mahatma said it could not be held before Tuesday since the Viceroy will be out and on Monday Mahatmaji will observe his day of silence.

('53', 65, 1, 2, 128383) Mahatmaji was asked who was the patient he had in mind when he spoke of temperature.
('53', 65, 1, 3, 128468) He said: I am the patient.

('53', 65, 4, 7, 128582) Asked on his return from Viceregal Lodge by the Associated Press represen tative as to how he would sum up the position emerging from his talks in Simla up till this afternoon, Mahatma Gandhi replied: The position is as it was when I arrived in Simla on the 15th.
('53', 65, 5, 8, 128846) Q. How would you compare the spirit that you noticed at the Viceregal Lodge and at Mr. Emersons and Sir James Crerars residences?
('53', 65, 6, 9, 128976) A. It will not be right to make any comparison.
('53', 65, 6, 10, 129024) I can say that everywhere I received the utmost cordiality.
('53', 65, 6, 11, 129084) Lord Willingdon was as usual very affable and kind.
('53', 65, 7, 12, 129136) Q. Was the talk today only about the Delhi Pact or anything else?
('53', 65, 8, 13, 129202) A. Today it was all about the Pact.
('53', 65, 9, 14, 129238) Q. Are the questions connected with the Round Table Conference likely to be raised when you meet Lord Willingdon next?
('53', 65, 9, 15, 129357) Mahatma Gandhi after hesitation replied: I suppose they will come up.
('53', 65, 10, 16, 129427) Q. Is there any likelihood of S. Vallabhbhai Patel coming up to Simla ?
('53', 65, 11, 17, 129499) A. I do not expect.

('53', 65, 14, 20, 129563) The following complaint 1 received from Bombay deserves attention: I do not share the correspondents hope that my advice will be followed.
('53', 65, 14, 21, 129702) If my advice was universally followed, all of us, grown up or young, women or men, the rich or the poor, would be spinning and wearing khadi, there would be no distinctions of high and low, and no
('53', 65, 15, 22, 129899) 1 Not translated here
('53', 66, 0, 1, 129921) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 67
('53', 66, 1, 2, 129964) untouchables; Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and others would be living as blood brothers and employers and workers as fathers and sons or as elder brothers and younger brothers.
('53', 66, 1, 3, 130135) In brief we would be enjoying complete swaraj by now.
('53', 66, 1, 4, 130189) But I know that neither my voice nor my pen can reach very far.
('53', 66, 1, 5, 130253) In spite of this fact, as I have been trying to follow the teaching of the Gita in life, I strive to remain free from attachment and, whenever circumstances require that I should write, I do write or speak.
('53', 66, 1, 6, 130460) The complaint quoted above provides such an occasion.
('53', 66, 1, 7, 130514) There is nothing uncommon in the complainants experience.
('53', 66, 1, 8, 130572) Which of us living in big cities has had no such experience at some or other time?
('53', 66, 1, 9, 130655) Being weak men ourselves, we fall upon a pickpocket like an army attacking an ant.
('53', 66, 1, 10, 130738) This is not a question of non violence at all.
('53', 66, 1, 11, 130785) A brave man, however violent his inclinations, would not beat up anyone in this manner.
('53', 66, 1, 12, 130873) The ordinary citizens have no right to punish a thief or murderer caught red handed.
('53', 66, 1, 13, 130958) Not even the police has that right.
('53', 66, 1, 14, 130994) It belongs to the judge alone.
('53', 66, 1, 15, 131025) The public may arrest such a culprit and, if they do, they should make him over to the police.
('53', 66, 1, 16, 131120) To beat up any person in this manner is a crime and, if the pickpocket lodges a complaint, it would be the duty of the police to arrest those who beat him and, if the complaint is found true by the judge, it would be his duty to punish the culprits.
('53', 66, 1, 17, 131370) Moreover, if the pickpocket was beaten as described by the correspondent, the offence was one of causing grievous hurt so that the culprit would get sentence of imprisonment.
('53', 66, 1, 18, 131545) However, everyone beating up a thief believes himself safe as it has become customary to do that.
('53', 66, 1, 19, 131643) Who would listen to the appeals of the thief?
('53', 66, 1, 20, 131689) It is true that most of those who beat up a thief are themselves white thugs.
('53', 66, 1, 21, 131767) That is why when in old times some people started stoning a prostitute, Jesus said gently: He that is pure among you, let him cast the first stone. The narrator says that none had the courage to cast a stone at her.
('53', 66, 1, 22, 131983) How can a sieve [with a hundred holes] laugh at the jug [with only one]?
('53', 66, 1, 23, 132056) That pickpocket was perhaps starving without a loaf to eat, but the white thug steals to gratify the cravings of the flesh.
('53', 66, 1, 24, 132180) The idea of non violence came into being as an extension of the thought that a sinner had no right to sit in judgment over another.
('53', 66, 1, 25, 132312) It does not matter if we cannot reach the waters of the lake of non violence; it is enough for us to touch the shore of common justice.

('53', 67, 1, 2, 132526) 74. MORVIS LESSON TO SATYAGRAHIS
('53', 67, 2, 3, 132559) The Morvi Satyagraha is over and it is a matter of joy for all and of credit for both the State and the satyagrahis that all the satyagrahis have left the State.
('53', 67, 2, 4, 132721) Both displayed moderation, the State in uncon ditionally releasing the satyagrahis and the satyagrahis in not persis ting in satyagraha and leaving the State territory.
('53', 67, 2, 5, 132890) When things have ended happily in this manner, it would be improper to enter into the rights and wrongs of the matter or rake up the past.
('53', 67, 2, 6, 133029) But I should like to say this: There was some haste in under taking the satyagraha.
('53', 67, 2, 7, 133113) The improper criticism of the Morvi ruler after the satyagraha had started has brought discredit on us and the fair name of satyagraha has been tarnished.
('53', 67, 2, 8, 133268) The unworthy criticism and the exaggeration which were indulged in afterwards to justify the satyagraha were a cause for shame for the satyagrahis.
('53', 67, 2, 9, 133416) They cannot disown responsibility for them on the ground that all this was done by others.
('53', 67, 2, 10, 133507) When non satyagrahis thus run to the help of satyagrahis, sometimes it becomes necessary to stop the satyagraha.
('53', 67, 2, 11, 133620) When a large number of non satyagrahis join a hand of satyagrahis, the latter should leave the crowd.
('53', 67, 2, 12, 133722) We may have occasions to act thus in our movement too.
('53', 67, 2, 13, 133777) Whether and when such an occasion may be said to have arisen should be determined by examining each case on its merits.
('53', 67, 2, 14, 133897) I did feel that such a stage had been reached in this case, but fortunately the satyagraha ended before it became necessary to take such a decision.
('53', 67, 2, 15, 134046) I would now advise the satyagrahis to make amends by publicly acknowledging the errors which may have been made.
('53', 67, 2, 16, 134159) The confession of an error constitutes sincere atonement for it, and by such confession the satyagrahi increases his strength.
('53', 67, 2, 17, 134286) Satyagraha means purity.
('53', 67, 2, 18, 134311) The higher the degree of purity, the greater the satyagrahis strength.
('53', 67, 2, 19, 134382) I have offered my compliments to the Maharaja Saheb, for he readily consented to release the satyagrahis.
('53', 67, 2, 20, 134488) However, I must say that his offi cials have not been altogether above reproach.
('53', 67, 2, 21, 134569) The police constables failed to observe moderation.
('53', 67, 2, 22, 134621) Though there was exaggeration in the accounts of man handling and use of force, there was also an element of truth in them.
('53', 67, 2, 23, 134745) All this was not quite unavoidable.
('53', 67, 2, 24, 134781) I know that the police are never a body of pure men.
('53', 67, 2, 25, 134834) They regard the use of force as a religious duty.
('53', 67, 2, 26, 134884) They believe that a

('53', 68, 1, 2, 134947) criminal will understand only the language of force and that all who fall into their hands are criminals.
('53', 68, 1, 3, 135053) It simply passes their understanding that in this age large numbers of innocent men willingly and knowingly put themselves in their hands.
('53', 68, 1, 4, 135192) Hence, in their view at any rate, all such persons deserve nothing but the lathi and abuse.
('53', 68, 1, 5, 135284) This being the state of things, if those in authority wish to act with justice, they should warn the police to behave them selves.
('53', 68, 1, 6, 135415) I think I should stop here.
('53', 68, 1, 7, 135443) For, in Tulsidass immortal words:
('53', 68, 2, 8, 135477) Gods whole creation, living and non living, contains both good and evil.
('53', 68, 2, 9, 135550) The wise accept the good and leave the evil, (like the swan) which drinks the milk and leaves water behind.
('53', 68, 2, 10, 135658) Let us pay attention only to the goodness displayed by the Ruler and the satyagrahis and bring about harmony between them.
('53', 68, 2, 11, 135781) A word of personal advice to the Saurashtra satyagrahis.
('53', 68, 2, 12, 135838) You are only a handful, but you have raised high hopes in me.
('53', 68, 2, 13, 135900) Any error on your part, though as tiny as a speck of dust, must appear in my eyes as big as a pikestaff.
('53', 68, 2, 14, 136005) Only then can we work together.
('53', 68, 2, 15, 136037) You should not entertain even the thought of satyagraha as long as you have in you any trace of passion, ill will, violence or untruth.
('53', 68, 2, 16, 136173) Your first duty is to train yourselves and become fit for satyagraha.
('53', 68, 2, 17, 136243) You should not assume that it is your duty to attack immorality or injustice wherever you find them in Kathiawar.
('53', 68, 2, 18, 136357) Instead, silently go on doing constructive work and make yourselves fit for satyagraha.
('53', 68, 2, 19, 136445) Do not launch an invasion.
('53', 68, 2, 20, 136472) When you are attacked, by all means welcome the opportunity for a fight.

('53', 68, 5, 23, 136610) Shri Virchand of Vanod writes: 1
('53', 68, 6, 24, 136643) I am inviting fresh trouble on myself by publishing this letter, but there is no escape.
('53', 68, 6, 25, 136732) Though the letter concerns only an individual, the issues raised in it are of public importance, and I have been asked to give my opinion on them; I think it is my duty to give it.
('53', 68, 7, 26, 136913) 1 The letter is not translated here.
('53', 68, 7, 27, 136950) It narrated at length how the Durbar (Chief) of Vanod persecuted the correspondent and his relations for their nationalist acti vities.
('53', 69, 0, 1, 137086) 70 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 69, 1, 2, 137127) satyagrahi is patient enough, he will be faced with no case of injustice in which he would be completely helpless.
('53', 69, 1, 3, 137242) One should, however, bear in mind that, if the person who is the victim of injustice has no strength in himself, there is no means of helping him.
('53', 69, 1, 4, 137389) This is a limitation inherent in the nature of satyagraha.
('53', 69, 1, 5, 137448) Satyagraha aims at providing an object lesson to victims of oppression so that they may be roused to struggle and deliver themselves from the oppression.
('53', 69, 1, 6, 137602) The satyagrahi has to keep patience till the victim is so roused.
('53', 69, 1, 7, 137668) If this is a limitation of satyagraha, it is also its special excellence.
('53', 69, 1, 8, 137742) A satyagrahi presumes to be nobodys guardian.
('53', 69, 1, 9, 137788) He suffers with the victim of oppression and thereby becomes his equal and shares his suffering.
('53', 69, 1, 10, 137885) Now let us turn to the issues raised.
('53', 69, 1, 11, 137923) 1. If the subjects of an Indian State are not ready to co operate in carrying out the constructive programme of the Congress in that State, no one from outside going there can carry it out successfully in the present circumstances.
('53', 69, 1, 12, 138155) It would not be right for anyone to argue that in that case the subjects of Indian States would never be roused.
('53', 69, 1, 13, 138268) It is a law of life that some good work being done at any point in an environment is bound to have its effect on the rest of it.
('53', 69, 1, 14, 138397) It was after this experience that the sages of the world gave it the dictum: As in oneself, so in the universe. If outsiders go and try to wake up asuppressed people, the latter are likely to fall into deeper slumber.
('53', 69, 1, 15, 138615) Moreover, one should bear in mind that the subjects of every Indian State frequently go to neutral territory, that is, British India, and imbibe from there the new ideals according to their capacity.
('53', 69, 1, 16, 138815) 2. The subjects of Indian States who go to British territory and join the swaraj yajna being carried on there run the risk of banish ment from their own State and also of having to suffer separation from their parents.
('53', 69, 1, 17, 139034) Further, if the parents have sympathy for their sons activities, they also should be ready to suffer banishment and lose their goods and property.
('53', 69, 1, 18, 139181) As the poet says, the path of love is enveloped in flames of fire.
('53', 69, 1, 19, 139248) Those who are not ready to be burnt to death in them should not tread that path.
('53', 69, 1, 20, 139329) Those parents who are not ready to be banished from the land of their birth and lose their property ought to be ready to disown their satyagrahi son.
('53', 69, 1, 21, 139479) Everyone should have the faith that any goods and property that will have remained safe when we win swaraj will return to the possession of the original owner or his heirs.
('53', 69, 1, 22, 139652) Durbar Gopaldas is certain that Dhasa will be returned to him when swaraj comes, and he has meanwhile chosen
('53', 70, 0, 1, 139761) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 71
('53', 70, 1, 2, 139804) not to be the Durbar of a handful of men so that he might be the servant of millions, in other words, to be a true Durbar.
('53', 70, 1, 3, 139927) A true satyagrahi renounces a little only to get something far greater.
('53', 70, 1, 4, 139999) 3. What should we do when the authorities in an Indian State challenge us to a fight?
('53', 70, 1, 5, 140085) This question does not at all arise where the restrictions laid down above are observed.
('53', 70, 1, 6, 140174) If, however, such a contin gency does arise, one should submit to the hardship as inevitable.
('53', 70, 1, 7, 140268) 4. Cannot the British Agency intervene in case of oppression by an Indian State?
('53', 70, 1, 8, 140349) It certainly can.
('53', 70, 1, 9, 140367) In my view, it ought to.
('53', 70, 1, 10, 140392) That is to say, if the Agency functions as a real agency, it can certainly do much.
('53', 70, 1, 11, 140476) Hence, the subjects of an Indian State have the right to approach it for redress of grievances, and it is desirable that they should.
('53', 70, 1, 12, 140610) That will test the Agencys worth.
('53', 70, 1, 13, 140644) 5. While, in British territory, the Congress stands up in defence of a petty watchman, is it to do nothing at all no matter how wilfully authority is exercised in an Indian State?
('53', 70, 1, 14, 140824) Yes, the position is somewhat like that.
('53', 70, 1, 15, 140865) Everyone has first to take the measure of his own strength.
('53', 70, 1, 16, 140925) He who speaks without the strength to follow up his words with action merely prattles.
('53', 70, 1, 17, 141012) The Congress may indeed be eager to do a number of things, but where it lacks the necessary strength for action it chooses to keep quiet.
('53', 70, 1, 18, 141150) And by doing that, it sometimes becomes stronger.
('53', 70, 1, 19, 141200) It is improbable that the Provincial [Congress] Committee should have given no reply.
('53', 70, 1, 20, 141286) If it has deliberately acted in that manner, I must admit that it should be considered to have been guilty of discourtesy.
('53', 70, 1, 21, 141409) I must admit that it must have had compelling reasons for that.
('53', 70, 1, 22, 141473) Now about Vanod in particular.
('53', 70, 1, 23, 141504) I have no information regarding any of the allegations made by Shri Virchand.
('53', 70, 1, 24, 141582) I do not know what the Vanod Durbar has to say about them.
('53', 70, 1, 25, 141641) It would indeed be painful if the allegations are true.
('53', 70, 1, 26, 141697) If the Vanod Durbar sends a reply to the allegations, I will certainly publish it.
('53', 70, 1, 27, 141780) I shall be glad if the reply is satisfactory.
('53', 70, 1, 28, 141826) It will do honour to the Durbar to acknowledge any mistake that may have been made by him or his men.
('53', 70, 1, 29, 141928) Every man is liable to err.
('53', 70, 1, 30, 141956) Princes are no exception to this rule.
('53', 70, 1, 31, 141995) I have already stated my opinion as to what Shri Virchand, his parents and the State subjects should do if his complaint is true.
('53', 70, 1, 32, 142125) If the subjects show their displeasure and migrate in a body, the ruler would become helpless and would have no choice but to come to terms with them.
('53', 70, 1, 33, 142276) An indi vidual or a group, that is, the people as a whole, always have the right
('53', 71, 0, 1, 142357) 72 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 71, 1, 2, 142398) to migrate, and such migration, if undertaken deliberately and carried out peacefully and firmly, is never known to have failed its aim.

('53', 71, 4, 5, 142595) SIMLA, July 19, 1931
('53', 71, 5, 6, 142616) MIRA, As usual outside Gujarat I can get no time for writing letters and I have been only a trifle better in Simla than Bombay.
('53', 71, 5, 7, 142744) Here though there is not such a rush of visitors, constant attendance upon Emerson and interviews with the Home Member and the Viceroy separately and prolonged beyond all calculation have left me no time for anything else, and twice I had to finish the evening meal hurriedly.
('53', 71, 5, 8, 143021) I followed your advice and read the introduction 1 in the library 2. The original must be very good.
('53', 71, 5, 9, 143122) I marvel at the immense industry that Romain Rolland gives to all he writes.
('53', 71, 5, 10, 143199) The introduction is another sketch like the one he wrote before, bringing his opinion up to date.
('53', 71, 5, 11, 143297) Your translation is quite readable.
('53', 71, 5, 12, 143333) It does require retouching in several places but I have no difficulty in making out what the original must be like.
('53', 71, 5, 13, 143449) The merit of your translation is that it is faithful to the original.
('53', 71, 5, 14, 143519) For the reasons you have stated you are naturally anxious to know definitely whether we are going to London or not.
('53', 71, 5, 15, 143635) But I fear that I might not be able to come to a decision even at the end of the Simla visit.
('53', 71, 5, 16, 143729) There are many difficulties and many hitches.
('53', 71, 5, 17, 143775) I think I have been able to make it clear to the authorities that I cannot go if the present unsatisfactory state of things continues.
('53', 71, 5, 18, 143910) But the authorities may find it difficult or may be unwilling to give satisfaction.
('53', 71, 5, 19, 143994) I had hoped to be able to leave today but may not be able to get away before Tuesday or Wednesday.
('53', 71, 5, 20, 144093) These delays do not worry me because it has been the lot of my life.
('53', 71, 5, 21, 144162) Take no thought for the morrow has got to be literally followed by one who will enforce his own life to he teaching of the Gita.
('53', 71, 5, 22, 144291) You should therefore tell both Romain Rolland

('53', 72, 1, 2, 144478) and your sister how uncertain everything is here and how difficult it is to give definite news about the proposed departure for London long in advance.
('53', 72, 1, 3, 144630) The proper thing is not to expect us till we have actually embarked.
('53', 72, 1, 4, 144699) I hope you are now quite at peace with yourself and realized that the loved one lives more truly for the dissolution of the body and renders the love also truer because unselfish and also because it is transferred to all that lives.
('53', 72, 1, 5, 144932) Every death of a friend or a relative should enrich universal love.

('53', 72, 6, 10, 145117) KAMALNAYAN, I had discussed your case with Kakasaheb.
('53', 72, 6, 11, 145171) You seem to be considerably unsettled in mind.
('53', 72, 6, 12, 145218) The idea of a private tutor for you does not appeal to any of us.
('53', 72, 6, 13, 145284) If you do not find an academic atmosphere at the Vidyapith, there is a school at Poona to which you may be sent.
('53', 72, 6, 14, 145397) If you agree, I may try to get you admitted to it.
('53', 72, 6, 15, 145448) Discuss this with Kakasaheb.
('53', 72, 6, 16, 145477) My own experience is that anyone who is sincerely eager to study can satisfy his desire at any place.
('53', 72, 6, 17, 145579) However, we certainly do not wish to stand in your way.
('53', 72, 6, 18, 145635) On the contrary, we are anxious to satisfy your wish as far as we can

('53', 73, 3, 4, 145854) BHAISHRI GORADIA, I had been thinking of writing to you and was trying to find the time needed, when I got your letter.
('53', 73, 3, 5, 145974) I did what I did as a matter of duty, and therefore, deserve no praise.
('53', 73, 3, 6, 146046) Let us consider what should be done now.
('53', 73, 3, 7, 146087) I asked Mahadev to write down what he observed and what he gathered as a result of his inquiries.
('53', 73, 3, 8, 146185) His note is attached with this.
('53', 73, 3, 9, 146217) Go through it carefully, and, if you think proper, show it to the Maharaja Saheb too.
('53', 73, 3, 10, 146303) It is certainly good that all is now quiet, but why should the subjects of Morvi be so timid?
('53', 73, 3, 11, 146397) The satyagrahis had, in their enthusiasm, overstepped the limits, and for that they were treated worse than even murderers; how can that be tolerated?
('53', 73, 3, 12, 146548) Think by what means a recurrence of such incidents can be prevented and adopt them.
('53', 73, 3, 13, 146632) The prohibitory order against the holding of meetings, etc., should now be withdrawn.
('53', 73, 3, 14, 146718) Lakshmiprasad should be reinstated.
('53', 73, 3, 15, 146754) Whatever his shortcomings, he is a very old and loyal official.

('53', 75, 2, 3, 148727) SIMLA, July 20, 1931
('53', 75, 3, 4, 148748) DEAR MR. EMERSON, I have a letter from Mian Ahmad Shah enclosing copy of a letter addressed to the Deputy Commissioner, Peshawar and enclosures thereto.
('53', 75, 3, 5, 148901) I send you herewith copies of these papers.
('53', 75, 3, 6, 148945) And below is an extract from a letter just received from Khan Saheb Abdul Ghaffar Khan.
('53', 75, 4, 7, 149033) The Government seems to be bent on repression.
('53', 75, 4, 8, 149080) Two of the Khudai Khidmatgars were shot dead and it is generally believed that the officials had a hand in it.
('53', 75, 4, 9, 149191) We inquired and discovered that those Khudai Khidmatgars had no enemies, nor had they any quarrel with anyone.
('53', 75, 4, 10, 149302) A young man had informed me that a police sub inspector had asked him to take any kind of revenge he wants to take from his uncle, he could even kill him if he liked.
('53', 75, 4, 11, 149469) The sub inspector assured the young man that no action will be taken against him.
('53', 75, 4, 12, 149551) The young man, my informant, and his uncle were not on good terms and the latter is the President of the local Jirga.
('53', 75, 4, 13, 149669) The Government is arresting and punishing people under Sec.
('53', 75, 4, 14, 149729) 40 F.R. Act and they have promulgated Sec.
('53', 75, 4, 15, 149772) 144 Cr.
('53', 75, 4, 16, 149780) P.C. in many places without any reason.
('53', 75, 4, 17, 149820) The police generally threaten and assault Khudai Khidmatgars.
('53', 75, 4, 18, 149882) It is generally believed by the people that the Government is purposely provoking people to create disturbance.
('53', 75, 5, 19, 149994) The police severely assault small boys for crying Inqilab Zindabad.
('53', 75, 5, 20, 150062) On the 13th of June some Europeans were driving in car at Sudoom, Tehsil Mardan, when a small boy cried Inqilab Zindabad.
('53', 75, 5, 21, 150184) The Europeans stopped the car and got down and caught hold of the boy and threw him in the central canal.
('53', 75, 5, 22, 150290) Then again, on the 13th of July at Nevakali, Tahsil Savabi some Europeans severely assaulted a boy for raising the same cry.
('53', 75, 6, 23, 150415) For realizing rent, they put the people to all kinds of torture.
('53', 75, 6, 24, 150480) They are made to sit the whole day under the hot sun and then they are put in small dungeons which have no ventilation.
('53', 75, 7, 25, 150600) I hope you will be good enough to take notice of these facts.
('53', 75, 7, 26, 150662) While our fight was going on there was not so much repression as it is now.
('53', 75, 7, 27, 150738) I have done my best to keep people quiet and once a Government official paid me this compliment, but how long it will be possible for me to make them remain quiet?
('53', 75, 7, 28, 150902) In Kohat, village people were allowed to take away salt free of cost before the fight but now after the Truce even this has been stopped and they are

('53', 76, 1, 2, 151095) no longer allowed to take away salt free of cost.
('53', 76, 1, 3, 151145) These statements make confusion worse confounded.
('53', 76, 1, 4, 151195) On the one hand you give me information that the Khudai Khidmatgars nicknamed Red Shirts are causing endless trouble.
('53', 76, 1, 5, 151313) On the other there are complaints on behalf of them, as now, that their liberty is unduly being interfered with.
('53', 76, 1, 6, 151426) There ought to be a way out of knowing the real truth.
('53', 76, 1, 7, 151481) Could you please tell me what Malkhand Agency is?
('53', 76, 1, 8, 151531) Is it or is it not within the zone of the Settlement?

('53', 76, 9, 23, 152060) I got your letter.
('53', 76, 9, 24, 152079) Do you still beat children?
('53', 76, 9, 25, 152107) Ramabehn was complaining that you did.

('53', 77, 8, 13, 152808) Gangabehn does not seem to have recovered peace of mind.
('53', 77, 8, 14, 152865) Has Panditji done so?

('53', 78, 2, 3, 153635) SIMLA, July 20, 1931
('53', 78, 3, 4, 153656) GANGABEHN, I got your letter.
('53', 78, 3, 5, 153686) You have some subtle pride in you.
('53', 78, 3, 6, 153721) That is what is hurting you.
('53', 78, 3, 7, 153750) We bow to Mother Earth every morning and pray for her forgiveness for touching her with our feet.
('53', 78, 3, 8, 153848) I have explained the significance of this verse.
('53', 78, 3, 9, 153897) The Earth bears our burden but does not hurt us; she bears the burden uncomplainingly.
('53', 78, 3, 10, 153984) According to modern discoveries, she is hanging in space without support.
('53', 78, 3, 11, 154058) If she were to get angry with us and stray ever so slightly from her path, we would instantly perish.
('53', 78, 3, 12, 154160) For crores of years, however, the Earth has been rot ating in her orbit and has sustained our life.
('53', 78, 3, 13, 154260) This is the utmost limit of humility.
('53', 78, 3, 14, 154298) We have sprung from this earth and to that shall we return.
('53', 78, 3, 15, 154358) After knowing this, what pride can we feel?
('53', 78, 3, 16, 154402) We are but a particle of dust and should remain so.
('53', 78, 3, 17, 154454) Those who wish to kick us or insult us should be welcome to do so; such is the humility which non violence implies.
('53', 78, 3, 18, 154570) Cultivate it and you will be able to dance with joy.
('53', 78, 3, 19, 154623) You can cultivate it only in the Ashram, for, willingly or unwillingly, you have to regard every inmate of the Ashram as a member of your family.
('53', 78, 3, 20, 154769) You have to spend your whole life with them.
('53', 78, 3, 21, 154814) You will have to swallow bitter draughts there.
('53', 78, 3, 22, 154862) Do so and roar like a lioness.
('53', 78, 3, 23, 154893) Never to give up, even though we may die. We used to sing this bhajan formerly.

('53', 79, 8, 14, 155546) This prolonged visit to Simla was unexpected.
('53', 79, 8, 15, 155592) But there was an unexpected delay at Bombay.
('53', 79, 8, 16, 155637) The situation took such a turn that it could not be solved by letter.
('53', 79, 8, 17, 155707) By the time I come to Gujarat, maybe the matter will no longer be of any interest.
('53', 79, 8, 18, 155790) Do not feel disheartened by all this.
('53', 79, 8, 19, 155828) You should regard this as jettisoning of cargo from a ship caught in a storm.

('53', 80, 1, 3, 156342) I hope you will like it.
('53', 80, 1, 4, 156367) Please excuse delay.1 My stay here has been extended.
('53', 80, 1, 5, 156421) I may have to stay over till Wednesday.
('53', 80, 1, 6, 156461) The situation is certainly serious.
('53', 80, 1, 7, 156497) Even if it improves it will remain a patchwork effort.
('53', 80, 1, 8, 156552) Everywhere we see weakness.
('53', 80, 1, 9, 156580) But then that is the way of the world.

('53', 80, 5, 15, 156848) July 20, 1931 I believe that there is not good reason for the antipathy some people have towards the Congress.
('53', 80, 5, 16, 156959) There will always be private property.
('53', 80, 5, 17, 156998) So long as there are persons some personal property is bound to remain.
('53', 80, 5, 18, 157070) I do not wish to see the destruction of capitalists and Indian States.
('53', 80, 5, 19, 157141) I wish to see them reformed.
('53', 80, 5, 20, 157170) In this struggle for purification anything that cannot be purified will automatically be destroyed.
('53', 80, 5, 21, 157270) As imperfect human beings, we can only hope and pray that everything may be purified and all impurity may be wiped out.
('53', 80, 5, 22, 157390) We do not know what is absolutely impure.
('53', 80, 5, 23, 157432) As a sentiment, everyone should accept the principle of economic equality.
('53', 80, 5, 24, 157507) But in practice there will never be such equality.
('53', 80, 5, 25, 157558) There will always be some people who have more wealth and some who have less.
('53', 80, 5, 26, 157636) It will be sufficient if those who have more consider themselves trustees, not owners of their wealth.
('53', 80, 5, 27, 157739) We should spread and foster such a sentiment.
('53', 80, 5, 28, 157785) The Congress means its collective membership.
('53', 80, 5, 29, 157831) It is self evident that the Congress cannot go further than the collective sentiment of its members.
('53', 80, 5, 30, 157932) Complete observance of truth and non violence means economic, political and moral equality.

('53', 81, 3, 5, 158326) I had instructed Mahadev and Devdas to write something in acknowledgment.
('53', 81, 3, 6, 158400) No news from this end.
('53', 81, 3, 7, 158423) Even if a compromise is reached, it will not make me happy.
('53', 81, 3, 8, 158483) They no longer trust the Congress.
('53', 81, 3, 9, 158518) Everywhere Congress workers are being prosecuted.
('53', 81, 3, 10, 158568) How long can they hold out [empty] promises to me here?
('53', 81, 3, 11, 158624) I ought to go to England but I do not feel like going.

('53', 81, 3, 13, 158727) I find the fulfilment of life in simply doing the tasks that arise naturally from moment to moment.
('53', 81, 3, 14, 158827) Considering the atmosphere here I would not be surprised if no invitation was extended to you.
('53', 81, 3, 15, 158922) Even if you dont get one, are you proceeding to America on August 15?

('53', 82, 2, 3, 159874) Q. How do you find the weather conditions now?
('53', 82, 2, 4, 159921) A. I am not an expert in reading the weather.
('53', 82, 2, 5, 159967) Therefore you must approach the meteorological observatory.
('53', 82, 3, 6, 160027) Q. If you are going to London, can you indicate as to when you would be sailing ?
('53', 82, 3, 7, 160109) A. On the 15th August.
('53', 82, 3, 8, 160132) Maybe even earlier.
('53', 82, 4, 9, 160152) Q. There is an impression in the public mind that you have been shifting your position regarding the conditions of your attending the Round Table Conference.
('53', 82, 4, 10, 160310) For example it is said that at one time you stated that you would not attend the Conference unless the Hindu Muslim question was solved.
('53', 82, 4, 11, 160447) Now you say that you will proceed to London only if the weather conditions, as you put it, are favourable.
('53', 82, 4, 12, 160554) Can you explain yourself ?
('53', 82, 4, 13, 160581) A. I have not shifted my ground.
('53', 82, 4, 14, 160614) My position has all along been absolutely uniform and he who runs may read it.
('53', 82, 4, 15, 160693) It is plain in the resolution 1 of the Congress Working Committee.
('53', 82, 4, 16, 160760) The Committee decided to send me to London, even though the Hindu Muslim question might not be solved, but provided other favourable conditions existed; and I am simply waiting for those favourable conditions to appear.
('53', 82, 5, 17, 160980) Q. Do these conditions apply only to the Pact?
('53', 82, 5, 18, 161027) A. Yes, only to the Pact.
('53', 82, 6, 19, 161053) Q. When do you expect these conditions to appear?

('53', 88, 1, 4, 171602) So far as the arrears are concerned, it is contended that if the authorized arrears are suspended because of the fall in prices, as they are, the unauthorized arrears deserve the same treatment with greater force, because the men having been civil resisters have in addition to the losses due to low prices suffered severe losses through migration.

('53', 95, 3, 4, 187263) Interviewed by the Associated Press special representative, as he emerged from the Viceregal Lodge, Mahatma Gandhi said that the conversations were inconclusive.
('53', 95, 3, 5, 187425) But I am not staying for any further interviews.
('53', 95, 3, 6, 187474) I am leaving tomorrow for Bardoli whence I proceed to Borsad.
('53', 95, 4, 7, 187536) Pressed to say whether there would be any further negotiations, Mahatma Gandhi said there might be negotiations possibly through correspondence, by which light might be seen later.
('53', 95, 4, 8, 187717) For the present the position is, in Gandhijis hackneyed expression: As you were.
('53', 95, 4, 9, 187798) The temperature of the patient is the same.
('53', 95, 5, 10, 187842) Asked about his going to England, Mahatma Gandhi said it was still doubtful and there would be no certainty until he was on board he steamer.

('53', 95, 8, 13, 188029) SIMLA, July 21, 1931 I have your kind letter of 20th inst.
('53', 95, 8, 14, 188088) inviting me on behalf of the Prime Minister to be a member of the Federal Structure Committee as also a member of the full conference.
('53', 95, 8, 15, 188223) Whilst I appreciate the invitation and would like to respond, as I have already conveyed to you, I have serious difficulties in the way of my proceeding to London.
('53', 95, 8, 16, 188387) I came to Simla in the hope that the difficulties would be removed.
('53', 95, 8, 17, 188455) But our protracted conversations have not advanced matters so as to enable me to come to a positive decision.
('53', 95, 8, 18, 188565) I feel that the way things are moving in India at the present moment, unless they improve, make it impossible for me to leave India.
('53', 95, 8, 19, 188698) Reports pour in upon me from every part showing that Congressmen are being harassed without any justifiable cause.
('53', 95, 8, 20, 188813) In some places they say that they are being harassed much more than during the civil disobedience campaign.
('53', 95, 8, 21, 188921) I know your difficulty especially when things are being done under cover of law.
('53', 95, 8, 22, 189002) I have suggested several ways out.
('53', 95, 8, 23, 189037) But I am sorry that they have not

('53', 96, 1, 2, 189114) commended themselves to you.
('53', 96, 1, 3, 189143) In the circumstances the most I can say is that I must watch events and if I find that things have not taken a better turn I must reluctantly come to the conclusion that I must not go.
('53', 96, 1, 4, 189328) I need hardly say that I seek no protection for any Congressman from prosecution for manifest breach of the common or the statutory law of the country.
('53', 96, 1, 5, 189480) My complaint is about acts manifestly outside the law and processes which are demonstrably vexatious.
('53', 96, 1, 6, 189582) It grieves me that I am not able to send you a better letter.
('53', 96, 1, 7, 189644) But I am helpless.
('53', 96, 1, 8, 189663) After much cogitation I have come to the conclusion that I should send my son Devdas Gandhi to the Frontier Province.
('53', 96, 1, 9, 189781) I would feel ill at ease if I could not send anybody at all especially after the information that Mr. Emerson gave me.
('53', 96, 1, 10, 189900) As I said to you during our conversation he will be asked to refrain from making any speeches or accepting any addresses.
('53', 96, 1, 11, 190022) My sole object in sending him is to promote peace and to avoid a catastrophe if it is at all possible.
('53', 96, 1, 12, 190125) His presence would also insure Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan responding to the Commissioners invitation.

('53', 96, 4, 15, 190275) SIMLA, July 21, 1931 In accordance with my promise made at the Viceregal Lodge this evening I reduce to writing my request for an impartial tribunal to decide upon matters of interpretation of the Settlement between the Government and the Congress that might be submitted to it from time to time whether on behalf of the Government or the Congress.
('53', 96, 4, 16, 190624) The following are the matters that require immediate adjudication unless there is agreement between the Government and the Congress as to the interpretation: (1) Whether picketing includes picketing of liquor shop auction sales?
('53', 96, 5, 17, 190853) 1 In reply the Viceroy said: Thank you very much for your letter of July 21st, and let me say that while I cannot accept as justified in fact the reasons you give for your present inability to intimate your acceptance of the invitations, I do hope that after our talks the apprehensions you now feel will disappear, and that you will be able to go to England as a member of the Federal Structure Committee and of the full Conference.
('53', 97, 0, 1, 191287) 98 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 97, 1, 2, 191328) (2) Whether it is competent for provincial Governments to prescribe the distance at which picketing can be done so as to render it impossible for picketers to be within sight of the shop picketed?
('53', 97, 1, 3, 191525) (3) Whether it is competent for a Government to limit the number of picketers so as to make it impossible to picket all the entrances of a particular shop?
('53', 97, 1, 4, 191681) (4) Whether it is competent for a Government to defeat peaceful picketing by permitting sale of liquor by the picketed shopkeeper at places other than licensed and during odd hours?
('53', 97, 1, 5, 191863) (5) Interpretation of clauses 13 and 14 in the application of particular cases which provincial Governments have regarded as not coming under those clauses and the Congress has held otherwise.
('53', 97, 1, 6, 192056) (6) Interpretation of the word return in clause 16(a).
('53', 97, 1, 7, 192111) (7) Whether a return of guns forfeited after cancellation of licenses for participation in civil disobedience is covered by the Settlement?
('53', 97, 1, 8, 192251) (8) Whether restoration of certain property seized under Ordinance IX and of Watan lands in Karnatak is covered by the Settlement and if it is, is it competent for a Government to impose any conditions upon such restoration?
('53', 97, 1, 9, 192476) (9) The meaning of the word permanent in Clause 19. (10) Whether it is competent for the Education Department to impose conditions upon students who took part in the civil disobedience campaign before admitting them or in virtue of perpetual rustication imposed during the civil disobedience campaign to debar the admission of students under the ban?
('53', 97, 1, 10, 192827) (11) Whether it is competent for a Government to punish a person or corporation, by reason of his or its having taken part in the civil disobedience campaign, e.g., forfeiture of pension, or grants and the like to municipalities ?
('53', 97, 1, 11, 193058) These are not to be treated as the only matters to be submitted to the tribunal.
('53', 97, 1, 12, 193139) It is possible that unforeseen cases may arise in future which may be claimed to come under the Settlement.
('53', 97, 1, 13, 193247) The procedure

('53', 98, 1, 2, 193304) to be adopted would be that written statements would be submitted both on behalf of the Government and the Congress and the points would be argued by counsel on behalf of the Government as on behalf of the Congress.
('53', 98, 1, 3, 193520) The decision of the tribunal would be binding on both the parties.
('53', 98, 1, 4, 193587) As I told you in the course of our conversation whilst I say nothing at the present moment as to a tribunal for the examination of questions of facts in the event of differences between the Government and the Congress I have not waived the demand.
('53', 98, 1, 5, 193835) Occasions may arise when the differences may be so vital as to make it obligatory on any party to press for a tribunal for the examination of such cases also.
('53', 98, 1, 6, 193994) I should, however, hope that we might be able to settle all points of difference without reference to any tribunal.

('53', 98, 4, 10, 194234) SIMLA, July 21, 1931 I want to go to London.
('53', 98, 4, 11, 194279) I hope to go to London.
('53', 98, 4, 12, 194303) I would go to Lord Willingdon now and say that I would have accepted the invitation were it not for my mistrust of the activities of the district authorities in certain areas during my absence.
('53', 98, 5, 13, 194497) In these words, Mr. Gandhi summed up his present position at the conclusion of an hours conversation tonight.
('53', 98, 6, 14, 194607) Mr. Gandhi will not see the Viceroy again in Simla and he told me that certain communications would be exchanged before he would be in a position to say yes or no.
('53', 98, 6, 15, 194771) Of his anxiety to go, there is no doubt whatever and when I suggested that the general opinion was that he would make a great mistake if he did not go to London he said he saw no reason to disagree with such opinion, but that he had to consider also the people in India.
('53', 98, 7, 16, 195042) But are you not devoting too much time to details instead of concentrating your attention on the broad issues? I asked.
('53', 98, 7, 17, 195162) Mr. Gandhi started to talk of South Africa and particularly his experiences at Spion Kopwhen his three officers were incapacitated.
('53', 98, 7, 18, 195294) He explained that he had to assume responsibility for 60 stretcher bearers working over a stretch of more than a score of miles and that he was amazed at the number of details he had attended to personally in order to secure efficient

('53', 99, 1, 2, 195641) working and a successful outcome.
('53', 99, 2, 3, 195675) Are you trying to draw a parallel for my benefit between such experiences and your present policy?
('53', 99, 3, 4, 195774) Mr. Gandhi agreed that he was and that only disaster could follow neglect of details.
('53', 99, 3, 5, 195860) Nor did he attempt to hide that the situation in the United Provinces was causing him the most concern.
('53', 99, 4, 6, 195964) He agreed that Sir Malcolm Haileys promise of agrarian legislation is an excellent thing for the future but emphasized that what is wanted is immediate relief, and Sir Malcolm Hailey has not indicated that though his speech is conciliatory.
('53', 99, 4, 7, 196205) He gave the instance of Gujarat where he had personally collected nineteen out of the twenty lakhs due and said that though the situation in the United Provinces was somewhat different he had offered during the recent negotiations to go there and do the same thing.
('53', 99, 5, 8, 196471) It is interesting to note that in the brief conversation I had with Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru yesterday afternoon he said he agreed with Sir Malcolm Hailey that the system in the United Provinces had collapsed and that the situation was very bad.
('53', 99, 5, 9, 196716) With this in mind I asked Mr. Gandhi whether he agreed that there was a danger that if the agricultural situation throughout India got very much worse chaos would supervene of a nature with which neither Mr. Gandhi nor the Government of India could successfully cope.
('53', 99, 5, 10, 196984) He emphatically agreed but added that there was no reason why it should reach such a stage.
('53', 99, 6, 11, 197076) I dont want to humiliate the Government of India and I dont want to set up a parallel Government but I do want the district authorities to allow responsible Congressmen to assist in chip [sic] assessing the ability of the peasants to pay.
('53', 99, 7, 12, 197315) There would seem to lie the crux of the present trouble, the barrier between Mr. Gandhi and London for he feels that the peasants will not get a square deal from Government and particularly from the landlords.
('53', 99, 7, 13, 197525) If I decide to go to England 1 shall endeavour to sail a week earlier than the remainder of the delegates.
('53', 99, 7, 14, 197632) I have had pressing innovations to visit Lancashire and I want to go straight there and explain the Congress attitude regarding foreign cloth for I dont wish to do anyone harm in Lancashire, or, indeed, anywhere else.
('53', 99, 7, 15, 197850) Picketing is now only an economic measure though it was, of course, used as a political weapon during the civil disobedience movement.
('53', 99, 7, 16, 197985) But now I take an immediate step if cases are reported to me which savour of more than verbal persuasion.
('53', 99, 8, 17, 198091) Mr. Gandhi made this statement while answering certain questions I put to him regarding the economic and financial problems, particularly as to the publication at this juncture of the Congress report on the National Debt of India.
('53', 99, 8, 18, 198322) 1 He agreed that its

('53', 100, 1, 2, 198433) publication might not be particularly opportune but said it was ready and saw no real reason for withholding it from the Press.
('53', 100, 1, 3, 198561) He denied that it amounted to a repudiation of debts and said that there must be a stock taking.
('53', 100, 1, 4, 198658) The Congress report was not intended to be the last word on the subject and all they wanted was that the British Government should treat India in the matter of the National Debt as the Irish Free State had been treated.
('53', 100, 1, 5, 198878) Mr. Gandhi did not think there was any connection between the Congress report and the fact that Sir Victor Sassoons statement 1 was made a fortnight earlier than was expected and he thought Sir Victor Sassoon was typical of many who prefer to see trouble ahead, particularly of Europeans who resent the fact that in future they could not possibly enjoy the same privileges as in the past.
('53', 100, 1, 6, 199267) Mr. Gandhi said there is a future for all Englishmen in India provided they are willing to work in the countrys interests and not selfishly or from a privileged plane.
('53', 100, 1, 7, 199435) Mr. Gandhi indeed admitted that he had received a letter from a prominent English banker suggesting that he should make a considered declaration on the subject and that he was considering it.
('53', 100, 1, 8, 199627) He added that nothing was farther from his mind than expropriating existing trading interests for there was room for all, but he did feel particularly about industrial developments which had destroyed the old village industries and thereby impoverished the peasantry.
('53', 100, 1, 9, 199895) Of rural uplift he thoroughly approved but said that he had Mr. F. L. Braynes experiments at Gurgaon thoroughly investigated and considered them a complete failure.
('53', 100, 1, 10, 200060) The Gurgaon uplift was the result of a dominant and forceful personality, Mr. Brayne, assisted by his wife.
('53', 100, 1, 11, 200168) I appreciate the sentiment but not the methods which have left the district bankrupt.
('53', 100, 1, 12, 200254) I am producing far better results in Gujarat and the cost is practically nil.
('53', 100, 2, 13, 200332) He strongly repudiated the suggestion that he would like to put India back three hundred or four hundred years but said that something must be done to mitigate the appalling poverty of the peasantry adding that if the whole of the Government taxation was remitted it would not solve the problem.
('53', 100, 2, 14, 200628) Taking my leave of Mr. Gandhi, I remarked, I think I shall say that you will ultimately decide to go to London, and he replied: I hope you are right.

('53', 101, 2, 3, 201008) SIMLA, July 21, 1931
('53', 101, 3, 4, 201029) Asked whether he was going away disappointed.
('53', 101, 3, 5, 201075) quick as a shot Gandhiji replied: I am going away neither disappointed nor hopeful.
('53', 101, 3, 6, 201159) It is all merely indecisive.
('53', 101, 4, 7, 201188) Q. Was there any talk about the Round Table Conference?
('53', 101, 5, 8, 201244) A. Nothing directly, it was all general.
('53', 101, 6, 9, 201285) Q. What was the hitch to an understanding?
('53', 101, 7, 10, 201328) A. It was all the old hitch about the Pact, which is still not working as well as it ought to.
('53', 101, 8, 11, 201423) Asked as to the possibility of the Government conceding the Congress demand for an arbitration board and an economic enquiry in the United Provinces, Gandhiji was particularly slow in answering here, but he gave the impression that it was a matter for farther negotiations and therefore some more time should elapse before a definite statement could be made.
('53', 101, 9, 12, 201782) Q. So you wont regard the negotiations as having broken down?
('53', 101, 10, 13, 201844) A. Not in the least.
('53', 101, 11, 14, 201865) Q. Was Sir Malcolm Haileys speech before the United Provinces Council on the land revenue position helpful in the discussions on the need for an economic enquiry?
('53', 101, 12, 15, 202028) A. I did not discuss this point with Lord Willingdon today.
('53', 101, 13, 16, 202088) Q. Is your going to London more certain as a result of your conversation in Simla ?
('53', 101, 14, 17, 202172) A. Not until I am seen boarding a steamer.
('53', 101, 15, 18, 202215) Q. How long more do you think you will take to decide on boarding a steamer?
('53', 101, 16, 19, 202292) A. A few more days and possibly soon after the forthcoming meeting of the All India Congress Committee in Bombay.
('53', 101, 17, 20, 202406) Q. So you dont anticipate the resumption of the civil disobedience move ment or non payment of taxes in the near future?
('53', 101, 18, 21, 202527) A. You are very true to your profession.

('53', 102, 12, 19, 203577) Experiments in diet are only a part of my quest for truth; I carry them out with due care for my health.
('53', 102, 12, 20, 203682) I had wanted to try and see if I could eat the bhakhari 1 of jowar or bajri, without leaving off dates and currants, and at the same time to give up milk.
('53', 102, 12, 21, 203837) When I got the opportunity, I undertook the experiment but had to abandon it.
('53', 102, 12, 22, 203915) However, I now do not take even as much as a pound of milk a week.
('53', 102, 12, 23, 203982) For the past three days, my food has been chiefly wheat chapati, vegetables, crushed almonds and, in addition, dates once in the morning.
('53', 102, 12, 24, 204120) Previous to this, I ate only dates and almonds, and of course lemons.

('53', 103, 4, 6, 204478) 104. HONESTLY
('53', 103, 5, 7, 204492) I heard a story about me of the Rae Bareli secret circulars reproduced in Young India of 2nd July that the adverbial clause and at the same time honestly was omitted from it.
('53', 103, 5, 8, 204667) I saw then an insidious paragraph in a newspaper which but for the previous information in possession, I would not have understood at all.
('53', 103, 5, 9, 204806) Here is the circular 1 itself as it is printed in Young India.
('53', 103, 5, 10, 204869) I was perturbed when I first heard about the omission.
('53', 103, 5, 11, 204924) Upon examining my file I found that and at the same time honestly did occur in copies received from Pandit Jawaharlal.
('53', 103, 5, 12, 205043) These were received by me subsequently to the publication of the circulars.
('53', 103, 5, 13, 205119) How then could the omission in Young India arise?
('53', 103, 5, 14, 205169) I had Mahadev Desai to write to the Manager to send me the manuscript (which is always preserved for some time), or to wire if it was possible the condition in which it was received at the press.
('53', 103, 5, 15, 205365) Here is the wire which has made this writing possible:
('53', 103, 6, 16, 205420) Your letter.
('53', 103, 6, 17, 205433) Words in question added marginally in ink in typed original but scored out by you in ink.
('53', 103, 6, 18, 205523) I now do recall the incident.
('53', 103, 6, 19, 205553) The original was sent to the press.
('53', 103, 6, 20, 205589) I have a recollection that the adverb appeared apart from the text and without any indication that it was part of it.
('53', 103, 6, 21, 205707) I have no recollection that I scored it.
('53', 103, 6, 22, 205748) How the manager knows that I scored it, I do not know.
('53', 103, 6, 23, 205803) My duty is to take the reader into confidence about what has happened.
('53', 103, 6, 24, 205874) (Here comes Mahadev Desai to whom as I am writing this I have shown the telegram.
('53', 103, 6, 25, 205956) He has a vivid recollection of what happened.
('53', 103, 6, 26, 206002) He must finish the story as he remembers it.
('53', 103, 7, 27, 206047) 1 Not reproduced here.
('53', 103, 7, 28, 206070) For the Confidential Circular (D.O. 12/6), vide Kisans Troubles in the U. P. , 19 6 1931 2 Mahadev Desais note read: Gandhiji usually hands me the copy for Young India some time before the final hour for posting.
('53', 103, 7, 29, 206283) Now that I see the telegram from the manager I vividly recollect that the words and at the same time honestly, were
('53', 104, 0, 1, 206399) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 105
('53', 104, 1, 2, 206443) I see in this no wilful omission by anybody.
('53', 104, 1, 3, 206488) I shall pursue the inquiry further and find out what the sender of the notes in which the circular was incorporated has to say and if it is relevant, I shall share it with the reader.
('53', 104, 1, 4, 206672) In my opinion the adverb honestly is an irrelevant addition and if anything makes the circular worse reading than otherwise.
('53', 104, 1, 5, 206797) It reminds one of the famous advice do it honestly if you can but do it.
('53', 104, 1, 6, 206870) But whether the addition improves the circular or taints it still further, I tender my unreserved apologies to the author and to all concerned for the omission of the adverb from the circular which undoubtedly contains it.
('53', 104, 1, 7, 207093) Having seen the adverb Mahadev Desai, I admit, should not have crossed it out.
('53', 104, 1, 8, 207172) Had he referred it to me, I should have let the adverb stand or referred to the sender before giving the circular to the public.
('53', 104, 1, 9, 207301) But as responsible editor, I must take upon me the moral blame as the legal would be, if there was any legal liability for the omission.
('53', 104, 1, 10, 207438) The moral for me is hasten slowly.
('53', 104, 1, 11, 207473) Those who will serve Truth absolutely cannot afford to be hasty even for a good cause.

('53', 104, 4, 14, 207616) The report of the committee appointed by the Congress to report on the obligations between Great Britain and India is a document of very great importance especially at the present moment.
('53', 104, 4, 15, 207804) No Congress worker should be without a copy.
('53', 104, 4, 16, 207849) Bahadurji, Bhulabhai J. Desai, K. T. Shah and J. C. Kumarappa deserve the warm congratulations of the nation for their labour of love.
('53', 104, 4, 17, 207984) The foreign readers of Young India should know that Sjt.
('53', 104, 4, 18, 208041) D. N. Bahadurji was at one time Advocate General and so was Sjt.
('53', 104, 4, 19, 208106) Bhulabhai J. Desai.
('53', 104, 4, 20, 208126) Both of
('53', 104, 5, 21, 208134) there on the margin, perhaps with a query, and giving no indication that they were part of the text, but every indication that the friend who had sent the copy of the circular had passed a sarcastic remark about the particular instructions in the circular on the margin.
('53', 104, 5, 22, 208405) I therefore scored it out.
('53', 104, 5, 23, 208432) I have also a recollection that there were what I thought such sarcastic remarks in one or two more places and upon my own responsibility I scored out the words, without referring the matter to Gandhiji.
('53', 104, 5, 24, 208636) Perhaps there was no time either.
('53', 104, 5, 25, 208670) But there it is.
('53', 104, 5, 26, 208687) It is a plain unvarnished account of what now appears to be a regrettable omission.

('53', 105, 1, 2, 208813) them are busy practitioners and well known lawyers apart from their having held the office of Advocate General.
('53', 105, 1, 3, 208925) Indeed that office gives no added importance to the holders.
('53', 105, 1, 4, 208986) It is a recognition of their importance and status in their profession.
('53', 105, 1, 5, 209058) K. T. Shah is an eco nomist of all India reputation, is an author of several valuable works and was for many years and only up to the other day Professor of Economics in the University of Bombay.
('53', 105, 1, 6, 209254) These three gentlemen are always busy and it was no little sacrifice on their part to give their time to the responsible work entrusted to them by the Congress.
('53', 105, 1, 7, 209415) J. C. Kumarappa, the convenor, is a professor in the Gujarat Vidyapith and therefore it was no additional sacrifice on his part.
('53', 105, 1, 8, 209544) He may be considered a registered national servant and therefore his time and labour were already at the disposal of the Congress.
('53', 105, 1, 9, 209675) He was chosen for this particular task for his accurate knowledge of economics and his aptitude for research work.
('53', 105, 1, 10, 209790) These four members were ably assisted at their invitation by Sjt.
('53', 105, 1, 11, 209856) G. N. Joshi, also an eco nomist of considerable experience.
('53', 105, 1, 12, 209916) I have given this introduction about the authors of the report so that foreign readers may know that the report is not a document prepared by superficial politicians but it is the creation of men who have a reputation to lose; who are no demagogues but men who write about things they know and weigh the words that they write.
('53', 105, 1, 13, 210243) The report is a critical examination of the financial transactions of the British Government in India.
('53', 105, 1, 14, 210346) The first volume is divided into five parts with a note on annual military expenditure and interest on claims by Prof.
('53', 105, 1, 15, 210465) Kumarappa.
('53', 105, 1, 16, 210476) The second volume which will be shortly published contains voluminous notes prepared by Prof.
('53', 105, 1, 17, 210570) K. T. Shah which could not be included in the body of the report.
('53', 105, 1, 18, 210636) The two volumes should give the student of Indian Public Debts all he can possibly need.
('53', 105, 1, 19, 210725) The first part of the first volume has short but interesting paragraphs on repudiation v.
('53', 105, 1, 20, 210815) ratification and sanctity of contracts.
('53', 105, 1, 21, 210855) The Congress has been charged with the desire for repudiating National Debt.
('53', 105, 1, 22, 210932) The authors of the report show that the question of repudiation does not arise at all, nor is there any question of sanctity of contracts because there is no contract.
('53', 105, 1, 23, 211100) The authors say: The Congress has often been accused of attempting to repudiate public debts.
('53', 105, 1, 24, 211194) Far from being a repudiation the offer of the Congress is to ratify burdens which have been undertaken in the countrys interest.
('53', 106, 0, 1, 211323) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 107
('53', 106, 1, 2, 211367) The present public debts cannot be truly called national debts for they have been incurred really by Great Britain and imposed upon India. They add: It has been suggested in some quarters that all these obligations have some degree of sanctity and should not be disputed.
('53', 106, 1, 3, 211639) We are unable to see any basis of sanctity in this matter.
('53', 106, 1, 4, 211698) These burdens were involuntarily imposed upon the revenues of India and if they are not shown to have been incurred for the benefit of the Indian people it is difficult to understand the use of the word sanctity in this connection. In fact it is difficult to understand this charge of repudiation.
('53', 106, 1, 5, 211996) If and when India takes over charge from the present administration the transaction would be like any ordinary transfer whether it is from seller to buyer or from trustee to his ward or from the wrong doer to the wronged.
('53', 106, 1, 6, 212218) In each one of these transfers there would be a proper stock taking, balance sheet and a taking over subject to audit and adjustment.
('53', 106, 1, 7, 212352) Burdens are never forced upon the transferee except in the case of the vanquished who have no choice.
('53', 106, 1, 8, 212454) The state contemplated for India is that of freedom from bondage complete or partial.
('53', 106, 1, 9, 212540) The taking over of such liabilities as India approves or is adjudged to pay will not mean a repudiation of the rest but would mean the taking over of the balance by the British.
('53', 106, 1, 10, 212718) If therefore any of the numerous bond holders or holders of promissory notes and the like have to lose, they will lose not because of repudiation by India but because of repudiation by the British.
('53', 106, 1, 11, 212916) And let no one regard the report as the final Congress demand.
('53', 106, 1, 12, 212979) The report is a valuable document for the guidance of the Congress and those who would study the history of the financial transactions of the British Government in India.
('53', 106, 1, 13, 213150) It is open to the Congress either to waive any of the items of the demand framed by the authors or to add to them if need be.
('53', 106, 1, 14, 213276) Then too, it has never been the Congress position that whatever demand the Congress makes must be accepted.
('53', 106, 1, 15, 213384) The Congress position has always been and today is that if the British Government do not accept the Congress claim, the items in dispute should be referred to an impartial tribunal.
('53', 106, 1, 16, 213566) Surely nothing more reasonable can be expected from the Congress.
('53', 106, 1, 17, 213632) Anything less will be a betrayal of the trust on the part of the Congress.
('53', 106, 1, 18, 213707) Nor is this an unusual demand.
('53', 106, 1, 19, 213738) The learned authors of the report have cited the Irish parallel.
('53', 106, 1, 20, 213803) On the creation of the Irish Free State, they say, the question naturally arose as to the apportionment of her liabilities for
('53', 107, 0, 1, 213930) 108 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 107, 1, 2, 213972) the national debts which at the time stood at  7,721 millions.
('53', 107, 1, 3, 214035) By clause 5 of the Ireland (Confirmation of Agreement) Act it is provided as follows:
('53', 107, 2, 4, 214121) The Irish Free State should assume liability to the service of the public debt of the United Kingdom as existing at the date hereof and towards the payment of War Pensions as existing at that date in such a proportion as may be fair and equitable having regard to the fair and just claim on the part of Ireland by way of set off or counter claim, the amount of such sums being determined in default of agreement by the arbitration of one or more independent persons being citizens of the British Empire.
('53', 107, 2, 5, 214625) So much for the position taken up by the Congress.
('53', 107, 2, 6, 214676) The claim summarized by the Committee is as follows:
('53', 107, 3, 7, 214729) Year Subject of Claims Crores Amount
('53', 107, 4, 8, 214766) Prior to

('53', 108, 1, 2, 215531) observations will be both instructive and interesting:
('53', 108, 2, 3, 215586) (a) That of the five or six items of productive character only two, viz., Railways and Irrigation works can, strictly speaking, be classed as such;
('53', 108, 3, 4, 215734) (b) That the productivity of the Railways and their contribution to the economic development of India is wholly different from that of the Irrigation Works;
('53', 108, 4, 5, 215891) (c) That the aggregate capital at charge on account of the Railways must admit a counter claim of eighty three crores at least as detailed above; before liability on that account can be accepted by the Indian people; though in strict commercial accounting and rigorous justice the counter claim would be at least doubled;
('53', 108, 5, 6, 216213) (d) That the debt on account of the Irrigation Works and other Com mercial Department may be admitted as covered by sufficient earning assets transferred automatically to the new Government of India;
('53', 108, 6, 7, 216413) (e) That the productive character of the debt due from the Provincial Government, local self governing bodies or Indian States is extremely doubtful, the only support for the maintenance of this burden being found in the taxable capacity of the people within the respective jurisdiction.
('53', 108, 7, 8, 216701) (f) That even if full liability is assumed in regard to these an exception must be made in respect of the Bombay Development Debts (fifteen crores), which was incurred in the teeth of the protests of the people concerned, and against which therefore very little of valuable assets of a productive or earning character are available.
('53', 108, 7, 9, 217034) Their examination of Unproductive Debts includes external wars such as the Abyssinian War, Perak Expedition, War gifts, etc.
('53', 108, 7, 10, 217159) Comparing Indias contribution to the contribution by the Dominions they observe:
('53', 108, 8, 11, 217240) Indias contribution, as compared with that of the other Dominions of Britain, and her gains in results of the War show a very disproportionate balance.
('53', 108, 8, 12, 217392) While on the outbreak of the War, the other Dominions only offered to protect their own frontiers, or protect the Overseas Commerce within their regions, India alone, in addition to protecting her own territory, made large contributions to the Empires fighting forces in the European War.
('53', 108, 8, 13, 217681) The defence of the local frontier meant a considerable obligation only in the case of South Africa where there were German interests which might conceivably involve that territory in danger.
('53', 108, 8, 14, 217872) But the contribution of Australia in Gallipoli and in policing the seas does not at all compare favourably with that of India.
('53', 108, 8, 15, 217999) India received no particular advantage as a result of the success in the great
('53', 109, 0, 1, 218078) 110 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 109, 1, 2, 218120) struggle.
('53', 109, 1, 3, 218130) The Dominions shared along with Great Britain, in the reparations, such as they are, that have been received from Germany so far; but even this share, comparatively speaking, does not advantage India at all proportionat ely to her contributions and sufferings.
('53', 109, 1, 4, 218391) India has hardly any say in the muta tions of these reparation payments.
('53', 109, 1, 5, 218464) Part II of the first volume is headed India under the East India Companys Rule.
('53', 109, 1, 6, 218544) But I must resist the temptation to quote from this survey.
('53', 109, 1, 7, 218604) I have given, I hope, enough to whet the appetite of the reader.
('53', 109, 1, 8, 218669) I have seen some adverse comments on the report.
('53', 109, 1, 9, 218718) No uninformed criticism, however hostile, can diminish the value of a document which fortifies every statement with facts and figures.
('53', 109, 1, 10, 218853) If these critics mean business and are sincere in their criticism, let them offer constructive criticism and let them support it with facts and figures.
('53', 109, 1, 11, 219006) A discussion of this character cannot fail to be helpful.
('53', 109, 1, 12, 219064) I have no doubt that the authors do not claim infallibility for their conclusions.
('53', 109, 1, 13, 219147) If therefore any flaw is shown to them, they will be the first to acknowledge their error, and so far as the members of the Working Committee and those members of the general public who would care to study this authoritative report are concerned, they would be able to put such enlightened criticism side by side with and formulate their judgment.
('53', 109, 1, 14, 219495) Let me say in conclusion that when the Congress at Gaya 1 and then at Lahore passed a resolution about financial obligations 2 it was seriously meant.
('53', 109, 1, 15, 219646) The appointment of the Committee and its report were the natural corrollary.
('53', 109, 1, 16, 219723) The Congress will seriously follow the matter to the end.
('53', 109, 1, 17, 219781) If the Congress can help, India will not take a leap in the dark.
('53', 109, 1, 18, 219847) She cannot afford to be generous at the expense of the dumb millions who after all have to make the largest contribution towards the payment of any liabilities that may be undertaken.

('53', 110, 2, 3, 220264) The correspondent whose letter about Japanese enterprise I gave last week 1 sends also the following: 2
('53', 110, 3, 4, 220368) Nothing perhaps emerges so clearly from the perusal of the report of the British Cotton Commission to the Far East as the tremendous energy with which Japan has not only excluded practically all imports of foreign piece goods into her territories, but has also captured a number of markets abroad for the products of her own people.
('53', 110, 3, 5, 220701) Japan feels her destiny is bound up with the necessity to build up an ever growing export trade.
('53', 110, 4, 6, 220798) With such sentiments it is no wonder that the Government, no less than the industrialists, count no loss too great in finding fresh markets for the nations products.
('53', 110, 4, 7, 220964) One of the most remarkable measures that the Government passed during the last year was a Bill under which the Government on the advice of the responsible Minister will reimburse exporters to the amount of 70% of losses incurred on shipments to certain specified and undeveloped markets.
('53', 110, 4, 8, 221252) But the Governments active encouragement and support are matched by the readiness of the industrialists of Japan to take risk.
('53', 110, 5, 9, 221379) Here in India we do not wish to capture new markets, we want only to preserve the domestic market for ourselves.
('53', 110, 5, 10, 221492) If the Japanese industrialist can cheerfully write off large sums out of his capital in the effort to find out new markets, cannot the Indian capitalist be persuaded at least to refrain from making profits for a certain period in the interest of Indias more restricted and therefore more laudable effort?.
('53', 110, 5, 11, 221798) It is true as the correspondent says that we do not want to capture new markets.
('53', 110, 5, 12, 221879) But we must dare to suffer to exclude foreign cloth from ours.
('53', 110, 5, 13, 221942) Will the mill owners do it?

('53', 111, 3, 4, 222173) What the correspondent describes is, I am sorry to have to say, a common occurrence nowadays.
('53', 111, 3, 5, 222267) I am trying to do what is possible in terms of the Settlement and am still hoping that what appears to me to be a manifest breach of the Settlement will stop.
('53', 111, 3, 6, 222426) For I have heard it said that these sales are, so far as the law is concerned, legal.
('53', 111, 3, 7, 222512) It is thus a case of unbridled licence.
('53', 111, 3, 8, 222552) Meanwhile I can only advise a continuance of picketing and reliance upon gentle persuasion producing its effect upon those who, in their ignorant selfishness, are corrupting the manners of simple rustics, not excluding even babies.

('53', 111, 5, 10, 222807) 108. WOES OF UNTOUCHABLES
('53', 111, 6, 11, 222833) DEAR MAHATMAJI,
('53', 111, 7, 12, 222849) I venture to bring to your notice some principles which, I think, must be kept in view in the conduct of the campaign on behalf of the untouchable Hindus.
('53', 111, 8, 13, 223004) Among the numerous disabilities from which they suffer, a clear dis tinction must be made between those which are prima facie civic in their nature and those which are Prima facie non civil or religious or communal in their character.
('53', 111, 9, 14, 223239) The advice you gave to the leaders of a temple entry satyagraha last year, that such satyagraha should be offered by touchable Hindus alone, would be meaningless, unless by such satyagraha you meant a campaign on the part of the touchable sympathizers of the untouchables for a boycott by all worshippers of such temples as do not admit the untouchables, till such time as their managers accept the reform.
('53', 111, 10, 15, 223646) In these days of the incessant talk of protection of minorities who dare deny that if any minority in India needs to have special provisions in the future constitution for itself, it is the untouchables?
('53', 111, 11, 16, 223850) Their want of self assertion, their apathy towards their wrongs, their

('53', 112, 1, 2, 224097) pathetic contentment with their lotthese, of course, are the greatest obs tacles in the way of their emancipation from the bonds of diabolic custom.
('53', 112, 2, 3, 224246) I remain,
('53', 112, 3, 4, 224256) KARWAR, 17 6 1931 Yours sincerely,
('53', 112, 4, 5, 224291) S. D. NADKARNI The distinction made by Sjt.
('53', 112, 4, 6, 224335) Nadkarni between civil and religious disabilities is unnecessary because useless.
('53', 112, 4, 7, 224417) They are all religious because imposed in the name of religion by co religionists.
('53', 112, 4, 8, 224500) A useful distinction will be between those disabilities which require legislative treatment and those that do not.
('53', 112, 4, 9, 224615) In my opinion the confining at Vaikom of satyagraha to merely Hindus was perfectly sound and absolutely necessary.
('53', 112, 4, 10, 224730) The writer perhaps confounds satyagraha a special remedy with general agitation.
('53', 112, 4, 11, 224811) Whilst all can take part in a general agitation, only the actual victims can adopt the remedy of satyagraha.
('53', 112, 4, 12, 224920) The Hindus have to do penance.
('53', 112, 4, 13, 224951) How can Hinduism be purged by non Hindus doing penance?
('53', 112, 4, 14, 225007) It may easily lead to serious consequences if Mussalmans were to offer satyagraha in a dispute between Hindus and Hindus especially in a matter the latter consider to be religious.
('53', 112, 4, 15, 225188) Nor do I see any reason to alter the opinion that it is the business of touchable Hindus to lead the agitation side by side with the untouchables if only because the latter are today too powerless and too apathetic to their own sufferings.
('53', 112, 4, 16, 225428) It is not so much the inability on the part of untouchables to enter temples that matters as the sinful insolence of the touchables who impose the atrocious disability which matters.
('53', 112, 4, 17, 225611) Hinduism will not be purified by untouchables taking by storm the possession of a temple; it will be purified by the trustees and the worshippers recognizing the sin of prohibition and flinging open the gates to the untouchables.
('53', 112, 4, 18, 225841) It is for the Hindu reformers to multiply and offer satyagraha against blind orthodoxy.

('53', 113, 2, 3, 226060) This appeal for subscriptions to a Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Memorial has been before the public now for a long time.
('53', 113, 2, 4, 226177) It is signed by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and others, being personal friends and co workers of the martyr.
('53', 113, 2, 5, 226282) Sri Prakasa, Sevashrama, Benares Cantt., is the Secretary as also Treasurer and all subscriptions should be sent to him.
('53', 113, 2, 6, 226403) The objects of the Memorial are: 1. To erect a fountain or pillar or some similar memorial near the place where Ganesh Shankar gave up his body while offering protection to Hindus and Muslims.
('53', 113, 2, 7, 226596) 2. To assist the Pratap Trust.
('53', 113, 2, 8, 226627) Ganesh Shankar formed this Trust to which he entrusted the management of his famous Hindi paper Pratap.
('53', 113, 2, 9, 226731) The chief services of his lifetime were rendered through this paper.
('53', 113, 2, 10, 226800) The Trust is to be helped so that the foundations of Pratap may be strengthened.
('53', 113, 2, 11, 226881) 3. To help the Ashram established by him in the village of Narwal in the Cawnpore District.
('53', 113, 2, 12, 226973) Nearly 200 villages have been organized through this Ashram.
('53', 113, 2, 13, 227034) Spinning and khadi propaganda are the chief factors of Ashram work.
('53', 113, 2, 14, 227102) 4. To hand over the balance to the U.P. Provincial Congress Committee on the condition that Ganesh Shankar National Service shall be established with it.
('53', 113, 2, 15, 227256) This service should be on the same lines as the U.P. National Service, namely, to help whole time national workers in the province.
('53', 113, 2, 16, 227388) The sum asked for by the Memorial Committee is only one lakh of rupees.
('53', 113, 2, 17, 227460) In my opinion it is quite an insignificant amount for the objects of the Memorial as also the memory of the martyr.
('53', 113, 2, 18, 227576) I hope therefore that there would be a quick response so that the Committee may be able to close the list and go on with the work.

('53', 114, 1, 2, 227774) 110. QUESTION OF BAIL
('53', 114, 2, 3, 227796) Owing to the renewed activity of local authorities against Congressmen, I receive many inquiries as to the attitude they should adopt as to defence and bail.
('53', 114, 2, 4, 227954) I appreciate the general reluctance on the part of Congressmen to enter upon defence or being bailed out.
('53', 114, 2, 5, 228060) They have been used now for a long time to no defence and no bail formulae.
('53', 114, 2, 6, 228136) In virtue and in view of the Settlement, it is open to Congressmen both to be bailed out and be defended.
('53', 114, 2, 7, 228242) No one is bound to do either.
('53', 114, 2, 8, 228272) But I can imagine circumstances when it would be, whilst the Settlement lasts, a duty to be bailed out and be defended.
('53', 114, 2, 9, 228392) But it has been discovered that bails are often granted condi tionally upon the parties undertaking not to make speeches, etc.
('53', 114, 2, 10, 228519) Generally speaking, I would say that such conditional bails should not be accepted.
('53', 114, 2, 11, 228603) The same opinion applies and with greater force to security under Section 108. But there may be extraordinary circums tances when it may be deemed in the national interests to give bail.
('53', 114, 2, 12, 228790) The safest course in such cases would be to take the written opinion of ones immediate superior.
('53', 114, 2, 13, 228887) But I would commend to Congress workers the golden rule followed by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in Gujarat.
('53', 114, 2, 14, 228992) He has generally proscribed speech altogether by Congress workers, speeches being confined to him and me.
('53', 114, 2, 15, 229098) As a matter of fact, even he speaks only on such occasions when it becomes absolutely necessary.
('53', 114, 2, 16, 229195) I do not think that Gujarat has suffered for this rule of silence.
('53', 114, 2, 17, 229262) Whether at war or peaces what we need is silent work.
('53', 114, 2, 18, 229316) And work leaves little room for speeches.
('53', 114, 2, 19, 229358) Speeches play the least important part in political education.
('53', 114, 2, 20, 229421) Having been now accustomed for past fifteen years to less speaking we do not notice that the race of orators has almost died out.
('53', 114, 2, 21, 229551) It had its use but when the age of action commenced eloquence naturally took a back seat.
('53', 114, 2, 22, 229641) I have no doubt that if we imposed a self denying ordinance on ourselves we should be the stronger for action and the nations response will be wider and more substantial.
('53', 114, 2, 23, 229812) What is wanted is intimate personal contact between the villagers and workers.
('53', 114, 2, 24, 229891) The villagers should know their servants and feel that they, the servants are there not to serve their own ends but the interests of the villagers whom they endeavour to represent.
('53', 114, 2, 25, 230072) Though my advice just now arises out of the present situation,

('53', 115, 4, 9, 230579) It is no use forcing the pace.
('53', 115, 4, 10, 230610) But the real staying with me is the working out of the ideal I stand for.

('53', 116, 1, 2, 231592) 113. LETTER TO T. T. KOTHAWALA
('53', 116, 2, 3, 231623) Strictly Confidential BARDOLI, July 24, 1931
('53', 116, 3, 4, 231668) DEAR MR. KOTHAWALA, Though after our talk at Surat on 13th inst.
('53', 116, 3, 5, 231733) I had expected some action, I was unprepared for the terrible events of the past ten days.
('53', 116, 3, 6, 231824) You or your subordinates have used not only coercive but repressive measures against the poor villagers and practically forced payments from them.
('53', 116, 3, 7, 231971) In my opinion this is a breach of faith, if not of the Settlement.
('53', 116, 3, 8, 232038) The Government knew that Congressmen were telling the people to pay all they could whether on account of current dues or arrears.
('53', 116, 3, 9, 232168) We found also that it was all the people could do to pay the current dues without having to borrow.
('53', 116, 3, 10, 232268) We made an enquiry into the losses they had sustained.
('53', 116, 3, 11, 232323) I sent you too a note showing the losses suffered by the people.
('53', 116, 3, 12, 232388) Our workers threw themselves heart and soul into the work of collection.
('53', 116, 3, 13, 232461) As you know I was in Bardoli myself for some time doing the work and then it was that Sardar Vallabhbhai took the sole charge here and I went to Borsad.
('53', 116, 3, 14, 232614) Your subordinates knew what we were telling the people.
('53', 116, 3, 15, 232670) For some time payment from Siadla was not accepted until arrears were also paid.
('53', 116, 3, 16, 232751) We could not collect the arrears and ultimately payment was accepted against receipt for current dues without any reservation.
('53', 116, 3, 17, 232878) During all this time it was assumed that there would be no coercive processes and certainly no show of force or police raids to threaten poor people.
('53', 116, 3, 18, 233028) The payment made under these circumstances I regard as payments made under duress and forced in violation of the implied understanding that no processes would be issued except in cases where the Congress workers had no influence and where the people had not taken part in the civil disobedience campaign.
('53', 116, 3, 19, 233333) I do not bring herein the conversations I had with the Commissioner and with you and the impression left on my mind, but I do suggest that it was within your knowledge that we were telling the people that no coercion would be used against them if they paid at least the current dues or unless they could not conclusively show that they were unable to pay even these.
('53', 116, 3, 20, 233700) But in precipitating the crisis and using the extraordinary
('53', 117, 0, 1, 233760) 118 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 117, 1, 2, 233802) measures of the past ten days, without the Congressmen having been even given the opportunity of re examining the cases of the villagers concerned there is a distinct breach of faith.
('53', 117, 1, 3, 233986) In the circumstances I must ask you to refund the monies thus collected and withdraw all attachment notices and stop further coercion and repression.
('53', 117, 1, 4, 234136) I must mention herein the case of the present Patel of Varad whose removal has been demanded for a long time and in whose case no open enquiry has still been held.
('53', 117, 1, 5, 234300) There is also the matter of confiscated lands in five villages in Bulsar taluqa, in respect of which fines are being demanded for non agricultural use before they are restored.
('53', 117, 1, 6, 234477) This is in breach of the Settlement.
('53', 117, 1, 7, 234514) There are other matters which I dont propose to mention just now.
('53', 117, 1, 8, 234580) Unless satisfaction is given in the matters herein mentioned or an impartial open tribunal is appointed by the Government to examine the complaints herein made and all processes stopped meanwhile, I must regard the Settlement and the implied faith having been broken by the Government and regard myself as free to take such action as may be necessary to protect the interests of the people whom the Congress represents.
('53', 117, 1, 9, 235000) I would ask you please to let me have a reply by Sunday next noon.
('53', 117, 1, 10, 235067) Copies of this letter are being sent to Mr. Garrett, the Govern ment of Bombay and purport telegraphed to H. E. the Viceroy.

('53', 118, 21, 30, 236562) Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had kept me informed by tele gram of the painful happenings in Bardoli.
('53', 118, 21, 31, 236659) I had no idea whatsoever, when I met the Collector at Surat on the 13th instant, that the proce edings I have briefly described in the enclosed copy were contemplated.
('53', 118, 21, 32, 236827) I have sent a copy to Mr. Garrett also.
('53', 118, 21, 33, 236867) I send you a copy of the covering letter to Mr. Garrett so as to avoid repetition.

('53', 119, 4, 13, 237648) Everything was indecisive at Simla.
('53', 119, 4, 14, 237684) The prospect of going to London seems to me to be more remote than before.
('53', 119, 4, 15, 237759) I could get no real satisfaction from the Government.
('53', 119, 4, 16, 237813) It could easily have been broken but I do not want to break if it is at all avoidable.
('53', 119, 4, 17, 237900) The next few days will decide.
('53', 119, 4, 18, 237931) Things are very bad in Bardoli.
('53', 119, 4, 19, 237963) My weight was taken at Delhi yesterday.
('53', 119, 4, 20, 238003) I went to Dr. Ansari during the few hours stay.
('53', 119, 4, 21, 238051) I was found to be 95_ lb.
('53', 119, 4, 22, 238077) on an empty stomach in the morning.

('53', 121, 6, 7, 239983) DEAR SIR TEJ BAHADUR, I have not worried you till now about the interminable difficulties I have experienced about the Settlement.
('53', 121, 6, 8, 240114) But now that almost the breaking point has been reached it would be ungrateful on my part not to let you know what is happening.
('53', 121, 6, 9, 240243) I enclose therefore herewith a copy of the letter I have addressed to the Collector of Surat.
('53', 121, 6, 10, 240337) I may add that there are numerous other breaches which I have already brought to the notice of the Government of India.
('53', 121, 6, 11, 240457) I will not worry you with the catalogue at the present moment unless you want to study the whole thing from the beginning.
('53', 121, 6, 12, 240580) I have sent copies of the letter to the Commissioner of Gujarat as also to the Government of Bombay and I have telegraphed the gist of it to the Government of India.
('53', 121, 6, 13, 240746) The Government of India have just acknowledged my telegram and ask me not to take any precipitate action.
('53', 121, 6, 14, 240852) This is the reply I have wired to Simla: 1
('53', 121, 7, 15, 240895) The object of my sending this is not necessarily that you should take action.

('53', 122, 2, 3, 241404) July 25, 1931
('53', 122, 3, 4, 241418) MIRA, I could not write to you much yesterday for want of time.
('53', 122, 3, 5, 241482) I must dictate the balance whilst I have a few minutes to spare.
('53', 122, 3, 6, 241547) There is no reason for suppressing from me your grief if it is there.
('53', 122, 3, 7, 241617) These things are not remedied immediately there is intellectual conviction.
('53', 122, 3, 8, 241693) The heart responds very slowly to intellectual conviction.
('53', 122, 3, 9, 241752) Hence the necessity for practice enjoined in the 12th chapter of the Gita and in many other cases in that Book of Life.
('53', 122, 3, 10, 241872) It is enough that you do not give way to that grief and become unsettled again.
('53', 122, 3, 11, 241952) But I have told you that whenever it becomes unbearable you are at liberty to run to me.
('53', 122, 3, 12, 242041) I shall feel it but I am prepared for it.
('53', 122, 3, 13, 242083) It will not come upon me as a shock, nor will I accuse you of breach of promise.
('53', 122, 3, 14, 242164) You must, therefore, carry your practice with an easy mind and not allow it to gnaw into you.
('53', 122, 3, 15, 242258) It is enough that you are striving your best to overcome the weakness and realizing more and more that it is a weakness and not a definite want for your growth.
('53', 122, 3, 16, 242419) I have sent a peremptory letter to the Collector 1 with reference to the unbearable things that have happened in Bardoli.
('53', 122, 3, 17, 242541) If there is a satisfactory reply there may be some chance of going to London.
('53', 122, 3, 18, 242619) If the reply is unsatisfactory, as it is most likely to be, you may dismiss the London visit altogether out of your mind.
('53', 122, 3, 19, 242741) If we have to go at the last moment what does it matter?
('53', 122, 3, 20, 242798) Sufficient khadi can be procured and whatever has to be prepared can be prepared for you both by Pyarelal and me.
('53', 122, 3, 21, 242912) We can easily borrow a Singer machine.
('53', 122, 3, 22, 242951) A few hours work should prepare the necessary dresses for you and the rest can be done in London if we have sufficient cloth.
('53', 122, 3, 23, 243077) What may be necessary is sandals of acceptable leather which can be worn with stockings and also slippers or shoes.
('53', 122, 3, 24, 243193) We have somewhere in the Ashram specimen of sandals I used to wear in South Africa.
('53', 122, 3, 25, 243277) They are easily made and you can wear socks without any difficulty.
('53', 122, 3, 26, 243345) These may be made now and if they are not required, they can be sold.
('53', 122, 3, 27, 243415) The measurements are there.

('53', 125, 1, 5, 246144) Kaka must have acquainted you with the position about my going to England.
('53', 125, 1, 6, 246219) At present, the chances are 99 per cent against and 1 per cent in favour.
('53', 125, 1, 7, 246293) I shall go to Borsad on Tuesday.
('53', 125, 1, 8, 246326) Come and see me there.
('53', 125, 1, 9, 246349) Your judgment about Premabehn does not seem correct to me.
('53', 125, 1, 10, 246408) How many women workers do we have, who are, like her, honest, hard working and pure in heart?
('53', 125, 1, 11, 246502) She has boundless love for children.
('53', 125, 1, 12, 246539) It is true that she has defects.
('53', 125, 1, 13, 246572) But is there anyone among us who has none?
('53', 125, 1, 14, 246615) There is a great saying of Jesus: He that is pure among you, let him cast the first stone at her. All those present hung their heads in shame and none dared to cast a stone at the woman.
('53', 125, 1, 15, 246802) In old times it was a common custom to punish an immoral woman by stoning her.
('53', 125, 1, 16, 246881) One such woman was caught and the orthodox people of that day got ready to stone her.
('53', 125, 1, 17, 246967) Jesus admonished them as above.
('53', 125, 1, 18, 246999) Let us not act as they did.
('53', 125, 1, 19, 247027) We try to win over Premabehn and keep her in the Ashram be cause of her virtues.
('53', 125, 1, 20, 247108) In my eyes, her defects seem insignificant, while her virtues are many.
('53', 125, 1, 21, 247180) I came to know when I was in jail about her habit of beating children.
('53', 125, 1, 22, 247251) She knows that it is a bad habit and I believe that she is even anxious to overcome it.
('53', 125, 1, 23, 247339) If any defects which people may see in her are reported to me, I can write to her about them.
('53', 125, 1, 24, 247433) When I am there, I should certainly like to discuss with people the general management of the Ashram, but I do not wish to interfere with it just now.
('53', 125, 1, 25, 247584) I am not living in the Ashram, either physically or mentally, and therefore, think very little about it.
('53', 125, 1, 26, 247689) Whenever I happen to think about it, I feel that I have done wrong.
('53', 125, 1, 27, 247757) All of you should feel in the same manner.
('53', 125, 1, 28, 247800) If any of the volunteers who had joined the march go to live in the Ashram, they should do so only in order to serve and should remain content with whatever work is assigned to them.
('53', 125, 1, 29, 247983) This will serve two purposes.
('53', 125, 1, 30, 248013) The workers will be able to strengthen their self control and when the bugle sounds again, they will be able to come out instantly and join the struggle without throwing the affairs of the Ashram into disorder.
('53', 125, 1, 31, 248224) You say that Premabehn is full of spite.
('53', 125, 1, 32, 248265) Can you recollect any instances of spiteful behaviour on her part?

('53', 126, 2, 3, 248453) By attacking the Acting Governor of Bombay 1 what good could the Fergusson College student have intended to achieve?
('53', 126, 2, 4, 248570) The news papers have reported that the act was inspired purely by a desire for revenge either for the imposition of martial law in Sholapur or something else.
('53', 126, 2, 5, 248729) Even if the attack had resulted in the Governors death, it could not have undone what has happened.
('53', 126, 2, 6, 248829) By this attempt to take revenge, the student has only increased the prevailing bitterness.
('53', 126, 2, 7, 248920) He has put education to shame by such misuse of his learning.
('53', 126, 2, 8, 248982) Considering the circumstances in which the assault took place, it was also a form of treachery.
('53', 126, 2, 9, 249078) The student violated his duty to the Governor.
('53', 126, 2, 10, 249125) The latter was a guest of the Fergusson College, and a guests person is always held sacred.
('53', 126, 2, 11, 249217) They say that an Arab would not kill even an enemy while the latter was his guest.
('53', 126, 2, 12, 249300) As the student belon ged to the Fergusson College, he was one of the Governors hosts.
('53', 126, 2, 13, 249386) And what can be more treacherous than the host killing his own guest?
('53', 126, 2, 14, 249456) Are we to believe that the terrorists respect no limits?
('53', 126, 2, 15, 249513) And what right to protest against the Sholapur martial law or other acts of injustice has anyone who himself respects no limits of decency?
('53', 126, 2, 16, 249653) If someone committed such treachery against us, we would certainly feel indignant.
('53', 126, 2, 17, 249736) How can we do to others what we would not like to be done to us?
('53', 126, 2, 18, 249801) I am convinced that such acts bring no glory to India, but give it a bad name.
('53', 126, 2, 19, 249880) They do not increase but diminish our fitness for swaraj and in consequence, swaraj recedes farther from us.
('53', 126, 2, 20, 249989) A great and ancient country like ours will not win swaraj through treacherous murders.
('53', 126, 2, 21, 250076) We ought to remember that the departure of the British from India will not by itself mean swaraj.
('53', 126, 2, 22, 250174) Swaraj means the capacity to run the Government of the country on behalf of the people and for the people.
('53', 126, 2, 23, 250281) That capacity will not come simply if the British leave or are killed.
('53', 126, 2, 24, 250352) We shall acquire it by going to the millions of dumb peasants, acquainting ourselves with their hardships, serving them and winning their love.
('53', 126, 2, 25, 250496) Suppose that one or two thousand terrorists, or even more, succeed in killing every Englishman in India.
('53', 126, 2, 26, 250601) Will that enable them to run the Government of the country?
('53', 126, 2, 27, 250661) On the contrary, intoxicated by the success of their terrorist methods and in their arrogance, they will go on killing everyone whom they do not

('53', 127, 3, 5, 251113) 127. THREE QUESTIONS
('53', 127, 4, 6, 251134) A student writes: 1
('53', 127, 5, 7, 251154) The complaint against pure khadi is a very old one.
('53', 127, 5, 8, 251206) The inconvenience caused by the coarseness of khadi deserves to be tolerated for the sake of swaraj, or, rather, for the sake of our starving brethren.
('53', 127, 5, 9, 251358) From coarse khadi one may make and wear shorts reaching up to the knee or trousers reaching up to the ankle.
('53', 127, 5, 10, 251467) The resulting advantage will be saving of cloth and convenience in washing.
('53', 127, 5, 11, 251543) If dhoti is worn in South Indian style, that is, without being tucked up, that would save half the length of cloth.
('53', 127, 5, 12, 251659) No one should think, through ignorance or contempt or pride that it does not behove a Gujarati to imitate a South Indian.
('53', 127, 5, 13, 251781) Moreover, if any student feels that he is forced to do with shorts of coarse khadi, he has nobody but himself to blame.
('53', 127, 5, 14, 251901) Why should he not spin fine yarn for his own use?
('53', 127, 5, 15, 251951) By doing so, he would get a fine dhoti for the cost of the cotton and the labour charges for weaving, and would also have the satisfaction resulting from the knowledge that he had helped himself.
('53', 127, 5, 16, 252147) He cannot argue, either, that he cannot spare from his studies enough time for spinning His experience will tell him that he wastes many minutes of his time every day in doing nothing or doing useless things.
('53', 127, 5, 17, 252356) It would be enough if he saved some of them and spent them in spinning.
('53', 127, 5, 18, 252428) There is an English saying similar in meaning to the Gujarati saying that a girl not wishing to dance finds fault with the dancing ground.
('53', 127, 5, 19, 252567) One can find a hundred excuses for not using pure khadi.
('53', 127, 5, 20, 252624) If one has faith in khadi, one would find no difficulty insuperable.
('53', 127, 5, 21, 252693) 2. It is possible for the Bombay Provincial [Congress] Commit tee to publish a list of swadeshi goods available, but that is unneces sary.
('53', 127, 5, 22, 252832) The Swadeshi Sabha in Bombay has published such a list and

('53', 127, 6, 24, 252928) The correspondent had described the difficul ties in wearing khadi dhotis, asked for a list of swadeshi articles and sought guidance in education.

('53', 128, 1, 4, 253278) For earning a living, there are now several national activities such as khadi work.
('53', 128, 1, 5, 253362) There are also several industries which can advance the nations prosperity.

('53', 128, 4, 9, 253545) COMMITTEE FOR REMOVAL OF UNTOUCHABILITY
('53', 128, 5, 10, 253585) The work of the Committee for the Removal of Untouchability had merged in the struggle for swaraj, as hadhappened with several other committees when the struggle was on.
('53', 128, 5, 11, 253755) Untouchability had been quite forgotten at many places there.
('53', 128, 5, 12, 253817) However, now that partial peace reigns the custom seems to be reviving.
('53', 128, 5, 13, 253889) The Congress Working Com mittee has alerted the Committee for the Removal of Untouchability to deal with the situation.
('53', 128, 5, 14, 254009) Shri Jamnalalji has been its President.
('53', 128, 5, 15, 254049) We all know how, through his efforts and those of Swami Anand, the doors of several temples had been thrown open to the so called untouchables.
('53', 128, 5, 16, 254193) There is still much scope for effort in this direction and the effort should be made.
('53', 128, 5, 17, 254279) A practice which has struck deep roots through the centuries is not likely to disappear all at once.
('53', 128, 5, 18, 254380) It is difficult to open the eyes of a person who clings to irreligion taking it to be true religion.
('53', 128, 5, 19, 254481) Such is the difficulty we experience regarding untouch ability.
('53', 128, 5, 20, 254545) All the same the progress achieved in this matter and the awakening noticed among Hindus raise our hopes.
('53', 128, 5, 21, 254651) We do not now find many persons supporting untouchability or believing that the practice is so deeply rooted that it can never be eradicated.
('53', 128, 5, 22, 254793) However, we should not allow ourselves to be deceived by that progress.
('53', 128, 5, 23, 254865) The Untouchability Removal Committee will not let us rest in false hope.
('53', 128, 6, 24, 254938) SALARIES UNDER SWARAJ
('53', 128, 7, 25, 254960) A young correspondent writes: 1
('53', 128, 8, 26, 254992) This correspondent seems to have taken it for granted that, as
('53', 128, 9, 27, 255055) 1 The letter is not translated here.
('53', 128, 9, 28, 255092) It expressed apprehension regarding the consequences of ceilings on salaries recommended at the Karachi Congress.
('53', 129, 0, 1, 255206) 130 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 129, 1, 2, 255248) high salaries will be reduced, the small ones also will go down.
('53', 129, 1, 3, 255313) The existing position is that while the big salaries are excessively high, the small ones are too low for the employees livelihood.
('53', 129, 1, 4, 255445) Under swaraj the low salaries will probably be raised, instead of being reduced.
('53', 129, 1, 5, 255526) In one way at any rate they will seem to have increased.
('53', 129, 1, 6, 255583) As a result of the reduction in salaries, there will be simplicity in peoples way of living.
('53', 129, 1, 7, 255676) The effect of this will be felt universally and the earners of small salaries will feel a sense of contentment.
('53', 129, 1, 8, 255788) The fear of increase in corruption expressed by the correspondent will not be shared by those who know the salary scales in Japan and other countries.
('53', 129, 1, 9, 255939) There is very little connection between corruption and the size of salaries.
('53', 129, 1, 10, 256016) When the consciousness of dharma spreads and people are inspired by a sense of public service, they do not demand or accept bribes.
('53', 129, 1, 11, 256148) Giving high salaries for fear of spread of corruption would be, as the saying goes, like killing the buffalo for its skin.
('53', 129, 1, 12, 256271) In other words, it means that for preventing a man from taking a bribe occasionally, he should be paid a permanent bribe in the form of a big salary!

('53', 130, 6, 11, 257635) An elephant should not judge an ant by the same standard which he applies to himself.
('53', 130, 6, 12, 257721) How many spinning wheels do you require?
('53', 130, 6, 13, 257762) In Bardoli they have been spinning on the new Gandiva wheel, which gives complete satisfaction.
('53', 130, 6, 14, 257858) Will that type do for you?
('53', 130, 6, 15, 257885) It is very cheap, and one can spin on it with as much speed as on the ordinary type.

('53', 131, 3, 4, 258274) RAMNIKLAL, I got your letter.
('53', 131, 3, 5, 258304) I sent a prompt acknowledgement through Kishorelal yesterday.
('53', 131, 3, 6, 258366) As the complaint made against you at Bulsar had produced no effect on me, I had nothing to say to you.
('53', 131, 3, 7, 258469) However, I asked Godse and got from him whatever explanation I wanted.
('53', 131, 3, 8, 258540) I have nothing to say about your new activity also.
('53', 131, 3, 9, 258592) I know that, wherever you are, you will work honestly and carefully.
('53', 131, 3, 10, 258661) Moreover, at that place you have co workers who co operate with you and the other circumstances also are favourable.
('53', 131, 3, 11, 258778) I am sure, therefore, that you will do your work very well.
('53', 131, 3, 12, 258838) That is enough for me.
('53', 131, 3, 13, 258861) As for other news, you must have learnt it from Kishorelal.

('53', 131, 8, 19, 259104) I approve your idea of doing some service there whenever occasion offers itself, and improving your health as much as you can.
('53', 131, 8, 20, 259231) Anyhow learn the art of living with all types of women.
('53', 131, 8, 21, 259287) Remember that one who seeks to serve does not always get the place or work of ones own liking.
('53', 131, 8, 22, 259382) Our duty is to embrace with joy whatever opportunity for service may arise at any place.
('53', 131, 8, 23, 259471) This is not meant as criticism, but is an expression of hope for the future.

('53', 132, 3, 4, 259748) INDU, I got your brief letter.
('53', 132, 3, 5, 259779) You will get no boils if, while bathing, you rub the body properly and then clean it thoroughly with a dry towel.

('53', 132, 8, 12, 260111) BHAI FULCHAND, Read the accompanying letter 1 and think over it.
('53', 132, 8, 13, 260176) The sentence in your appeal, that atrocities were committed in some villages of Bhav nagar State as also in Bhavnagar proper, is not consistent with the rest of the appeal.
('53', 132, 8, 14, 260349) What were these atrocities?
('53', 132, 8, 15, 260377) What connection do they have with constructive work?
('53', 132, 8, 16, 260430) I think that there is much substance in Pattanisahebs complaint, and that the satyagrahis or their supporters indulge in a lot of exaggeration.
('53', 132, 8, 17, 260574) I should like you to save yourself from this.

('53', 133, 3, 5, 260996) You dont even mention your address!
('53', 133, 3, 6, 261032) There is nothing wrong in your having gone to Bombay.
('53', 133, 3, 7, 261086) No one is forced to remain in the Ashram.
('53', 133, 3, 8, 261128) Those only will stay on who voluntarily regard themselves as bound to it.
('53', 133, 3, 9, 261202) If a persons body shakes with cold even in sunshine, he must be covered with a blanket.

('53', 133, 3, 13, 261457) Have no hesitation in accepting jewellery which your brother may pledge with you.
('53', 133, 3, 14, 261539) You may even get things in writing from him.
('53', 133, 3, 15, 261584) You should not mind if he gives you no interest.

('53', 133, 10, 23, 261887) SHANTA,
('53', 133, 11, 24, 261895) I hear your thunder after many days.
('53', 133, 11, 25, 261932) All these days you had no time even to write to me.
('53', 133, 11, 26, 261984) But at last you have written, no matter what kind of a letter it is.
('53', 133, 11, 27, 262053) I must thank you for your kindness.
('53', 133, 11, 28, 262089) I will inquire into your complaint.
('53', 133, 11, 29, 262125) I have written to Narandas
('53', 133, 12, 30, 262152) 1 At the top of the letter Gandhiji wrote: Send this letter to Lilavati; I do not have her address.

('53', 134, 6, 10, 262629) She now lives in Solan, which is on the way to Simla.
('53', 134, 6, 11, 262683) I am thinking of sending you either there or to the place to which Padma is going.
('53', 134, 6, 12, 262766) I think she will go to some place near Almora.
('53', 134, 6, 13, 262813) Would you like to go there?
('53', 134, 6, 14, 262841) As Sarojinidevi will be with Padma, at either place you will have the company of a mature woman.
('53', 134, 6, 15, 262938) I shall reach Borsad on Tuesday.
('53', 134, 6, 16, 262971) If you like you may come to see me there and stay on as long as I am there.

('53', 134, 11, 21, 263208) PREMA, I got your letter.
('53', 134, 11, 22, 263234) You did not say how many years you had completed.
('53', 134, 11, 23, 263284) I admit that I ought to know.
('53', 134, 11, 24, 263314) But I am stupid in such matters.
('53', 134, 11, 25, 263347) Instead of saying, May you live long, I will say, May you soon become free from the sway of passion, become pure in heart and an ideal worker.
('53', 134, 11, 26, 263490) May you succeed in your striving. You have made your letter rich in both colours.
('53', 134, 11, 27, 263572) It breathes frankness.
('53', 134, 11, 28, 263595) I like it.
('53', 134, 11, 29, 263606) But it is also full of anger and pride.
('53', 134, 11, 30, 263646) I will not, however, comment on it in detail.
('53', 134, 11, 31, 263692) I beg this of you.

('53', 135, 1, 4, 263939) I will be satisfied if you note down these details for my information.
('53', 135, 1, 5, 264010) As for the rest, you and Narandas may do what you think best.
('53', 135, 1, 6, 264072) I dont wish to interfere with what you do.
('53', 135, 1, 7, 264115) It lies outside my sphere.
('53', 135, 1, 8, 264142) For one thing, I would not be able to judge about it; I would not be able to do justice to the parties concerned, nor have I the means of doing so.
('53', 135, 1, 9, 264290) I have assumed the role of your father and mother and, therefore, I can give you but one sided advice.
('53', 135, 1, 10, 264393) A satyagrahi, moreover, never demands justice.
('53', 135, 1, 11, 264440) Justice means measure for measure.
('53', 135, 1, 12, 264475) Satyagraha means truth evenagainst cunning, non violence against violence, forbearance against anger and love against hatred.
('53', 135, 1, 13, 264601) Where, in such satyagraha, is room for dealing out justice?

('53', 135, 7, 23, 264953) I shall expect to see you in Borsad on Tuesday.
('53', 135, 7, 24, 265001) I will not, therefore, write much in this letter.
('53', 135, 7, 25, 265051) You feel defeated, but there is no such word as defeat in a satyagrahis dictionary.
('53', 135, 7, 26, 265135) Even when someone insults you, you should go on singing cheerfully.
('53', 135, 7, 27, 265203) If you feel that Premabehn is your own daughter and not someone unrelated to you, everything will soon be all right.
('53', 135, 7, 28, 265320) You should not mind if, though your daughter, she acts as the leader of you all.

('53', 136, 6, 13, 265896) I had sent through Kaka a message about Mahavir.
('53', 136, 6, 14, 265945) You will probably get a wire tomorrow from Mathuradas.
('53', 136, 6, 15, 266000) Mahavir should not start till the latter arrives there.
('53', 136, 6, 16, 266056) I dont think it necessary for anyone to stay with him in Bombay.

('53', 136, 6, 26, 266416) If he has picked up weaving, no one who accepts him should expect him to do any other work.
('53', 136, 6, 27, 266508) I, too, believe that he cannot be provided with a tamboora 4. If any money has become due to him as pay, give it to him.
('53', 136, 6, 28, 266629) The problem between Gangabehn and Premabehn is becoming more difficult.
('53', 136, 6, 29, 266701) Do what you think best.
('53', 136, 6, 30, 266725) I have asked Gangabehn to come to Borsad on Tuesday.

('53', 137, 5, 14, 267610) Gajanans problem seems to have been solved.

('53', 138, 3, 4, 268498) BHAISHRI BHULABHAI, I had been arguing with myself whether or not it would be correct to thank you for the trouble you took over the report of the committee on financial transactions between India and Britain.
('53', 138, 3, 5, 268708) And today I came to the decision that I must write to you.
('53', 138, 3, 6, 268767) I have anyway ventured to write to Bhai Bahadurji.
('53', 138, 3, 7, 268818) You will yourself say that there was nothing much about what you have done.
('53', 138, 3, 8, 268894) But since we do not come across many who take such pains we needs must thank those who do.
('53', 138, 3, 9, 268985) Kumarappa said that you all took great pains.
('53', 138, 3, 10, 269031) And we are going to be obliged to give you still more trouble.
('53', 138, 3, 11, 269094) The time is bound to come.
('53', 138, 3, 12, 269121) I thank you now and hope I can take work from you then.

('53', 138, 8, 19, 269523) We are losing our good name by this delay.
('53', 138, 8, 20, 269566) I have written a letter to this effect to Chimanbhai.
('53', 138, 8, 21, 269620) I do not consider it sufficient that you have subscribed for the number of its shares falling to your lot.

('53', 139, 3, 6, 269982) But then the atmosphere here too should be conducive.
('53', 139, 3, 7, 270036) At present it is extremely adverse.
('53', 139, 3, 8, 270072) I have written a letter 1 in the nature of an ultimatum to the Government and am awaiting the reply.
('53', 139, 3, 9, 270173) I cannot write much due to lack of time.
('53', 139, 3, 10, 270214) But if you possibly can, do come to Bombay soon.

('53', 139, 7, 20, 270768) I had meant both free sandals and regular shoes with broad toes.
('53', 139, 7, 21, 270833) I have meant them for both of us.
('53', 139, 7, 22, 270867) I do not want both slippers and shoes.
('53', 139, 7, 23, 270906) I see that your winged companions are multiplying.
('53', 139, 7, 24, 270957) Perhaps they are the best company.

('53', 141, 6, 8, 272913) MY DEAR BHRR, Your letter rejoices me.
('53', 141, 6, 9, 272952) I was worried over the hanging up of your pension though I knew that it was bound to be paid in the end.
('53', 141, 6, 10, 273057) The receipt of the pension is more potent than any written word.
('53', 141, 6, 11, 273122) Do you not remember the story of a prisoner who, on having his fine paid for him, was set at liberty and yet asked for a receipt?
('53', 141, 6, 12, 273252) Your liberty is your receipt, said the Judge.
('53', 141, 6, 13, 273298) With reference to Simla we can say the mountain was in labour and did not bring forth even a ridiculous mouse.
('53', 141, 6, 14, 273409) What you have read in the papers this time happens to be largely true and my Mecca and Medina are at present Bardoli and Borsad and not St. James and Kingsley Hall.
('53', 141, 6, 15, 273574) My letter to the Collector is still being considered.
('53', 141, 6, 16, 273628) What is the use of my going to London if the things arising out of the Settlement are not put right?
('53', 141, 6, 17, 273729) A debtor who cannot pay interest is never going to pay the capital.
('53', 141, 6, 18, 273797) Do you not agree?
('53', 141, 6, 19, 273815) I am glad Hamida is settling down to her studies.
('53', 141, 6, 20, 273865) But you are not going to feel that I have waived all my claims and demands upon her.
('53', 141, 6, 21, 273950) I am likely to be in Borsad for 3 or 4 days.
('53', 141, 6, 22, 273995) The Sardar is also with me.
('53', 141, 6, 23, 274023) He will be probably going to Bardoli tonight.

('53', 142, 9, 13, 274653) The Bardoli business has come upon me as a shock.
('53', 142, 9, 14, 274703) Otherwise too, things in Gujarat are not yet quite cleared up.
('53', 142, 9, 15, 274766) I am working for all I am worth towards securing a just solution of the difficulties that come in my way.
('53', 142, 9, 16, 274872) I am daily expecting a reply from Mr. Emerson to the statement I sent to him in Simla at your instance about the legal points for interpretation of the Settlement, and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru is straining every nerve in the U.P. to clear the atmosphere there.
('53', 142, 9, 17, 275132) My son is already in the Frontier Province.

('53', 144, 6, 14, 277753) I had even wired to Jayaprakash on Monday.
('53', 144, 6, 15, 277796) I have had no reply from him.
('53', 144, 6, 16, 277826) I did not send you to Allahabad on my own.
('53', 144, 6, 17, 277869) But Jayaprakash had asked me where he and you should go.
('53', 144, 6, 18, 277926) If you can come away, I should like you to stay with me as long as I am in India and then live in the Ashram for five or six months.
('53', 144, 6, 19, 278059) If I go, I shall be leaving on the 15th.
('53', 144, 6, 20, 278100) It is not yet certain that I shall go.
('53', 144, 6, 21, 278139) If you can get permission to come before that date, do so.

('53', 144, 11, 31, 278493) BHAISHRI AMRITLAL, I had promised Shri Balwantrai to send my reply yesterday.
('53', 144, 11, 32, 278571) Pyarelal did not remind me of it, and when I remembered, it was 9 p.m.

('53', 145, 1, 2, 278755) My going is still very uncertain.
('53', 145, 1, 3, 278789) From what you and Balwantrai told me, I have come to the conclusion that nobody is as well informed about the Indian States as you two are.
('53', 145, 1, 4, 278929) And certainly not Mr. Abhyankar.
('53', 145, 1, 5, 278962) Believing this, I think that both of you should get ready.
('53', 145, 1, 6, 279021) It should be made clear that you two would be going independently, and not because I wanted you or advised you to go.
('53', 145, 1, 7, 279139) My own stand is this.
('53', 145, 1, 8, 279161) Even if there is no one with me, I think I shall be able to discharge my responsibility.
('53', 145, 1, 9, 279250) I shall not require the help of legal experts or of masters of facts, since my demand is very simple.
('53', 145, 1, 10, 279352) However, if persons like you happen to be there by chance or have purposely gone to England so as to be present there at that time, I might avail myself of their help.
('53', 145, 1, 11, 279520) If you decide to come, I assume that you will not make any speeches there, but will only do the work that I might ask you to do.
('53', 145, 1, 12, 279649) The chances of my going are 1 against 99.

('53', 145, 5, 15, 279755) Mr. Rishabhdas from Fatehpur, East Khandesh, writes: 1
('53', 145, 6, 16, 279810) The description of the evils in this letter is true.
('53', 145, 6, 17, 279863) There is no reason to be frightened or disheartened on reading it.
('53', 145, 6, 18, 279930) We are neither omniscient nor omnipotent.
('53', 145, 6, 19, 279972) Let us discharge our part of the duty; God has placed only this much in our hands.
('53', 145, 6, 20, 280055) By acting thus we shall succeed the better in our work and shall get contentment.
('53', 145, 6, 21, 280137) We should not be sorry even if other workers refuse to join us.
('53', 145, 6, 22, 280201) If we are determined to do our duty even in seclusion, perhaps others may join us there.

('53', 146, 2, 3, 280527) Mr. Vasantlal Murarka writes: 1
('53', 146, 3, 4, 280559) Congratulations to these reformers!
('53', 146, 3, 5, 280595) Peacefulness and courtesy have a salutary effect.
('53', 146, 3, 6, 280645) Feasts in memory of the dead subserve neither religion nor reason.
('53', 146, 3, 7, 280712) The only ground for such feasting can be delusion and pride of wealth.
('53', 146, 3, 8, 280783) Why do the wealthy not make donations to public causes in honour of the dead?
('53', 146, 3, 9, 280861) If they do that they will acquire fame and the soul of the dead will certainly get peace.
('53', 146, 3, 10, 280951) Such charity is in itself an offering in honour of the manes, a memorial.

('53', 146, 6, 13, 281082) No item of the Fundamental Rights resolution 2 passed by the Congress at Karachi has come in for so much notice as the resolution limiting the salary of Government servants to not more than Rs. 500 per month or Rs. 6,000 per year.
('53', 146, 6, 14, 281313) Had we not been accustomed by this foreign Government to high salaries for servants in the Public Department, the limit of Rs. 500 would not have produced any shock.
('53', 146, 6, 15, 281479) There is no sanctity about the high ruling salaries.
('53', 146, 6, 16, 281532) All the 46 Congress Presidents and the 46 Congresses have mourned over the ever growing public expenditure both military and civil.
('53', 146, 6, 17, 281664) Many Presidents have laid special emphasis on the high salaries.
('53', 146, 6, 18, 281729) The Karachi Congress gave concrete shape to the half century old complaint.
('53', 146, 6, 19, 281805) The way to examine the justness of the Congress conclusion is to find the proportion between the salaries and the average income of Indias millions, and secondly to compare both with the salaries and the average income of other countries.
('53', 146, 6, 20, 282044) I have been trying to secure the figures for the principal countries of the world.
('53', 146, 6, 21, 282127) The readers of Young India have had the average income of the principal countries but not the salaries.
('53', 146, 6, 22, 282231) I have now before me some figures about the Japanese Public Service, both superior and subordinate.

('53', 147, 1, 2, 282627) gets less than Rs. 1,000 per month, that is to say, anything between Rs. 10,000 and 10,700 per year, a Governor less than Rs. 600 or Rs. 800 per month, the Secretariat staff anything between Rs. 150 and Rs. 500 per month, President of the Supreme Court less than Rs. 1,000 per month, other judges anything between Rs. 150 to Rs. 700 per month, Chief of Police slightly over Rs. 700 per month, subordinate services Rs. 250 to slightly over Rs. 300 per month, a Police Constable from Rs. 60 to Rs. 80 per month, a Police Sergeant from Rs. 70 to Rs. 80. The average daily income of the Japanese per head is about four annas.
('53', 147, 1, 3, 283249) Compared then with the Japan figures, the Rs. 500 limit put by the Congress is over generous.
('53', 147, 1, 4, 283343) But we have been told that the Japanese service is neither so incorruptible nor so efficient as the Indian.
('53', 147, 1, 5, 283451) I came across, the other day, a speech of Mr. Arno Pearse on the working of Japanese mills.
('53', 147, 1, 6, 283543) These mills are gigantic public corporations.
('53', 147, 1, 7, 283589) What is therefore true of them is likely to be true of the other Japanese departments.
('53', 147, 1, 8, 283676) Here is what Mr. Pearse has to say about Japanese business morality:
('53', 147, 2, 9, 283745) Do not believe the old saying that the word of the Chinese is his bond,
('53', 147, 3, 10, 283817) but not so that of the Japanese.
('53', 147, 3, 11, 283850) The modern Japanese will drive a bargain but
('53', 147, 4, 12, 283895) he will stick to it much more than the modern Chinese.
('53', 147, 4, 13, 283950) As to the excellence of Japanese organization, inventiveness, technical skill and industry Mr. Arno Pearse is most enthusiastic, and he claims to speak from personal experience.
('53', 147, 4, 14, 284128) The suggestion therefore that there is a necessary connection between efficiency or morality and high salaries is pure superstition.
('53', 147, 4, 15, 284261) What is true is, that neither morality nor efficiency can be sustained, if less than a living wage is paid to employees.
('53', 147, 4, 16, 284382) And no doubt the scale of living wage will differ to a certain extent with the mode of life of the class to which a person belongs.
('53', 147, 4, 17, 284514) But the mode of life is not an abstract term.
('53', 147, 4, 18, 284560) It is relative, and a man, who has surrounded himself with artificial wants and created conditions out of all proportion to the natural surroundings in which the people of his country live, can claim no exceptional cosideration because of his artificial mode of life.
('53', 147, 4, 19, 284828) Such people unfortunately we have in our midst.
('53', 147, 4, 20, 284876) They will naturally feel the pinch during the transition stage, but they will soon accommodate themselves to the new and natural condition when the maximum of Rs. 500 per month will cease to appear ludicrous as it does today.
('53', 147, 4, 21, 285102) Among the many disservices of the foreign rule will be counted the great disservice the foreign rulers have done by reason of their having

('53', 148, 1, 2, 285285) imported for this country wholly unnatural mode of life, and more or less imposed it on their immediate surroundings.
('53', 148, 1, 3, 285403) This importation and imposition have rendered the task of solvent administration most difficult, and we are finding it difficult today to adopt ourselves to the extreme depression that has overtaken the world.
('53', 148, 1, 4, 285613) Had we not had a top heavy administration, we would have been, owing to our geographical position, a country least affected by the universal depression, as today we are perhaps the most affected.
('53', 148, 1, 5, 285809) And it was because I felt in Nainital the seriousness of the artificial condition created for us, that I made an appeal 1 to the business men and professional classes that they should anticipate the future and remodel their lives so as to make it easy for all, when the burden of administration is taken over by the people, to take to the new life.
('53', 148, 1, 6, 286158) It would be wrong to entertain the idea, that whilst the public services would be paid in accordance with the natural condition of the country, professional and business men would continue a mode of life out of all correspondence with their surroundings.

('53', 148, 3, 10, 286503) MUSHROOM COMPANIES
('53', 148, 4, 11, 286522) With the wave of swadeshi, bogus or mushroom companies and societies were bound to come into being.
('53', 148, 4, 12, 286622) Of these some were even fraudulent.
('53', 148, 4, 13, 286658) Some of the managers or agents of these societies were wanted men.
('53', 148, 4, 14, 286725) Sardar Vallabhbhai spotted these and their transactions.
('53', 148, 4, 15, 286782) He saw that simple folk were being duped by these unscrupulous agents.
('53', 148, 4, 16, 286853) The plague was spreading in Gujarat.
('53', 148, 4, 17, 286890) He therefore issued instruction that Congress Committees should inquire into these mushroom organizations and warn the people against them.
('53', 148, 4, 18, 287030) He told them also not to hesitate to summon police aid if it became necessary.
('53', 148, 4, 19, 287109) Eventually through the Sardars effort a Vigilance Committee was formed with Sjt.
('53', 148, 4, 20, 287190) Thakorlal P. Thakor as president and Sjt.
('53', 148, 4, 21, 287232) Nandlal Shah as secretary with headquarters at Dhana Suthars Poal, Ahmedabad.
('53', 148, 4, 22, 287310) This committee has submitted a report showing how disastrous the consequences are likely to be, if energetic steps are

('53', 149, 1, 3, 287600) Jamshed Mehta is of opinion, that it is highly likely that poor people will be robbed of nearly one crore of rupees if these transactions are not stopped in time.
('53', 149, 1, 4, 287763) The Committee deplores that prominent Congressmen have unwittingly lent their names as directors to these companies.
('53', 149, 1, 5, 287880) People have, therefore, seeing Congressmen as directors, believed in the companies and run into the traps.
('53', 149, 1, 6, 287987) It does not follow that all these companies are fraudulent, but the Committee believes the majority of them to be unsound business propositions.
('53', 149, 1, 7, 288132) They cite in support of their conclusions eminent authorities to show that the promises made by these companies or societies could never be carried out for any length of time.
('53', 149, 1, 8, 288308) Twenty five years ago, this financial plague it was nothing less had broken out.
('53', 149, 1, 9, 288389) It died but not without leaving many a desolated home behind.
('53', 149, 1, 10, 288451) Public memory is short.
('53', 149, 1, 11, 288475) Nearly a generation has gone by.
('53', 149, 1, 12, 288508) And the plague has broken out again in virulent form.
('53', 149, 1, 13, 288562) There are nearly 100 such societies in India of which nearly 40 are to be found in Gujarat.
('53', 149, 1, 14, 288654) It is too much to expect these societies to wind up their affairs, but it is not too much to expect the numerous Congress Committees to acquaint themselves with the existing situation and instruct the public accordirgly.
('53', 149, 1, 15, 288875) The Committee will gladly furnish information to all inquirers.
('53', 149, 1, 16, 288939) That is its special function.

('53', 149, 3, 18, 288999) With reference to the withdrawal of the salt concession in the Punjab a correspondent from Mianwali writes: 1
('53', 149, 4, 19, 289109) I have read your note 2 regarding the collection of salt near Kalabagh mines in the Mianwali district, and find, that the information upon which the note is based is not the whole truth, and presents an exaggerated picture of what really happened at Kalabagh.
('53', 149, 4, 20, 289369) The real facts are as follows:
('53', 149, 5, 21, 289400) The permission to the people to collect salt in terms of the Delhi Pact was kept secret from the public residing in the vicinity of the Kalabagh mines for sufficiently long time and it was not without some stir in the people, that the order was made known to them, and they were allowed to collect salt.
('53', 149, 5, 22, 289704) This permission remained in force for only 5 or 6 days, and during that period the people residing in the vicinity collected some salt, and I would frankly admit that certain people through sheer ignorance collected more than they required

('53', 150, 1, 2, 290079) or were allowed to do under the terms of the Pact; but the number of such cases was very small, and this could be remedied by giving simple warnings to the people, or making it known to them by beat of drum, etc., that they could not collect more salt than what was allowed to them under the Pact.
('53', 150, 1, 3, 290377) But I regret to bring it to your notice, that the authorities did not do anything of the sort, and at once issued a proclamation by beat of drum, that the people collecting salt would be prosecuted, with the result that the people at once stopped collecting any more salt.
('53', 150, 2, 4, 290650) In the circumstances, I would ask you on behalf of the people of the ilaqa to help them.
('53', 150, 2, 5, 290739) If the facts are as set forth by the correspondent, it is a clear case for relief.
('53', 150, 2, 6, 290822) I shall gladly bring the matter to the notice of the Government of India.
('53', 150, 3, 7, 290896) THE REAL SAFEGUARD
('53', 150, 4, 8, 290915) The Spectator of 4th instant has a reasoned editorial headed India and the British Commonwealth.
('53', 150, 4, 9, 291012) Its sub heading is The Real Safeguard.
('53', 150, 4, 10, 291051) This is its last paragraph:
('53', 150, 5, 11, 291079) We shall end on the note on which we began.
('53', 150, 5, 12, 291123) Win the goodwill and friendship of the peoples of India, and think only how we can help India to achieve the splendid destiny which we think could be hers, and we shall have created a safeguard which all the friction mongers will be powerless to disturb.
('53', 150, 5, 13, 291378) It is a bold policy and requires men of vision to pull it through.
('53', 150, 5, 14, 291445) Are there enough of them in Great Britain today?
('53', 150, 5, 15, 291494) I should vary the question and ask: Are there enough civilians in India today who have vision enough to win the goodwill and the friendship of the people of India?
('53', 150, 5, 16, 291658) The Editor has peoples, I know.
('53', 150, 5, 17, 291690) But though we may quarrel and murder one another, though we have numerous languages and still more numerous dialects, India is geographically one, and we are and have been only one people.
('53', 150, 5, 18, 291879) Those speaking the same language have been known before now to belong to different nationalities, and those that have fought among themselves like dogs have been known to belong to one nation.
('53', 150, 5, 19, 292072) The fact is that oneness of speech and absence of internal feuds are no indispensable test of nationality.

('53', 151, 1, 2, 292244) 162. FOUL PLAY 1
('53', 151, 2, 3, 292261) The worst feature of the attempted assassination of Sir Ernest Hotson the Acting Governor of the Bombay Presidency was, that the act was done by a student of the College which had invited His Excellency when as its honoured guest he was being shown round the College premises.
('53', 151, 2, 4, 292538) It was as though a host was injuring his guest under his own roof.
('53', 151, 2, 5, 292605) The canon recognized throughout the world is that the deadliest enemy, when he is under ones roof as guest, is entitled to protection from all harm.
('53', 151, 2, 6, 292754) The act of the student was therefore essentially foul play without a single redeeming feature.
('53', 151, 2, 7, 292849) For the Acting Governor it was a providential escape, and it was fortunate for India and more so for the student world.
('53', 151, 2, 8, 292969) I tender my congratulations to Sir Ernest Hotson as also to the nation.
('53', 151, 2, 9, 293041) It would be well if the believers in violence will take a lesson from this happy tragedyhappy because no one has suffered but the assailant.
('53', 151, 2, 10, 293182) Has he suffered, is he suffering, or is he deluding himself with the belief that he is a hero?
('53', 151, 2, 11, 293277) Let this event be a warning for the students.
('53', 151, 2, 12, 293323) After all a school or a college is a sanctuary where there should be nothing that is base or unholy.
('53', 151, 2, 13, 293424) Schools and colleges are factories for the making of character.
('53', 151, 2, 14, 293488) Parents send their boys and girls to them so that they may become good men and women It would.
('53', 151, 2, 15, 293583) be an evil day for the nation, if every student is suspected as a would be assassin capable of any treachery.
('53', 151, 2, 16, 293693) The Bhagat Singh worship has done and is doing incalculable harm to the country.
('53', 151, 2, 17, 293774) Bhagat Singhs character about which I had heard so much from reliable sources, the intimate connection I had with the attempts that were being made to secure commutation of the death sentence carried me away and identified me with the cautious and balanced resolution passed at Karachi.
('53', 151, 2, 18, 294061) 2 I regret to observe that the caution has been thrown to the winds.
('53', 151, 2, 19, 294130) The deed itself is being worshipped as if it was worthy of emulation.
('53', 151, 2, 20, 294200) The result is goondaism and degradation wherever this mad worship is being performed.
('53', 151, 2, 21, 294286) The Congress is a power in the land, but I warn Congressmen

('53', 152, 1, 2, 294468) that it will soon lose all its charm if they betray their trust and encourage the Bhagat Singh cult whether in thought, word or deed.
('53', 152, 1, 3, 294602) If the majority do not believe in the Congress policy of non violence and truth, let them have the first article altered.
('53', 152, 1, 4, 294724) Let us understand the distinction between policy and creed.
('53', 152, 1, 5, 294784) A policy may be changed, a creed cannot.
('53', 152, 1, 6, 294825) But either is as good as the other whilst it is held.
('53', 152, 1, 7, 294879) Those therefore who hold non violence only as a policy may not, without exposing themselves to the charge of dishonourable conduct, use the Congress membership as a cover for violence.
('53', 152, 1, 8, 295064) I cannot.
('53', 152, 1, 9, 295074) get rid of the conviction, that the greatest obstacle to our progress towards swaraj is our want of faith in our policy.
('53', 152, 1, 10, 295195) Let this fortunate failure of attempted assassination open our eyes.
('53', 152, 1, 11, 295264) But look at the Governors black record.
('53', 152, 1, 12, 295304) Does not the doer himself say he shot because of the Sholapur deeds, because he superseded an Indian and became Acting Governor?some hasty youths or even grown up people will argue.
('53', 152, 1, 13, 295486) My answer is: We knew all this when in 1920 we settled the Congress policy of non violence and truth.
('53', 152, 1, 14, 295588) There were, within our knowledge at the time, deeds much blacker than his worst enemies have imputed to Sir Ernest Hotson.
('53', 152, 1, 15, 295711) The Congress deliberately and after full debate came to the conclusion in 1920, that the answer to the vile and violent deeds of the Government was not greater violence on our part, but that it was profitable for us to answer violence with non violence and vileness with truth.
('53', 152, 1, 16, 295989) The Congress saw further, that the worst administrators were not bad inherently, but that they were a fruit of the system of which they were willing or unwilling victims.
('53', 152, 1, 17, 296160) We saw too that the system corrupted even the best from among ourselves.
('53', 152, 1, 18, 296233) And so we evolved a policy of non violent action that should destroy the system.
('53', 152, 1, 19, 296314) Ten years experience has shown that the policy of non violence and truth though followed half heartedly has answered phenomenally well, and that we are very near the harbour.
('53', 152, 1, 20, 296489) The record of Sir Ernest Hotson, however bad it may be, is wholly irrelevant and can in no way extenuate, much less excuse the double crime of attempted assassination and treachery.
('53', 152, 1, 21, 296671) The reported hostile demonstration by some students has made the ugly affair uglier still.
('53', 152, 1, 22, 296762) I hope that the students and the teachers throughout India will seriously bestir themselves and put the educational house in order.
('53', 152, 1, 23, 296894) And in my opinion it is the peremptory duty of the forthcoming meeting of the All India Congress Committee to condemn the treacherous outrage and reiterate its policy in unequivocal terms.

('53', 153, 1, 8, 297465) It has progressed past repression and retribution.
('53', 153, 1, 9, 297516) It will deal with violence in its own ranks in its own way.
('53', 153, 1, 10, 297576) Any Government action in excess of the demands of the common law will simply intensify the madness, and make the task of believers in non violence more difficult than it already is.

('53', 153, 4, 13, 297812) Whilst millowners have, to a certain extent, ceased to compete unfairly with khadi, cloth merchants seem to pay no heed to the Congress appeal not to injure genuine khadi by selling spurious khadi as if it was genuine.
('53', 153, 4, 14, 298031) A firm in Surat had the hardihood the other day to send its samples of spurious khadi to a khadi depot in Bombay.
('53', 153, 4, 15, 298145) I have the sample before me.
('53', 153, 4, 16, 298174) It is clearly mill khadi, but it is sold to the public as genuine article.
('53', 153, 4, 17, 298249) I have the name too of the firm that has been guilty of such dishonest and unpatriotic practice.
('53', 153, 4, 18, 298346) But I do not propose just yet to give the name to the public.
('53', 153, 4, 19, 298408) The remedy however lies in the hands of the purchasers of khadinot to buy khadi that does not bear the A.I.S.A. stamp and to buy from a shop certified by the A.I.S.A. wherever such a shop is to be found.
('53', 153, 4, 20, 298612) Intelligent buyers should really find no difficulty in distinguishing genuine from spurious khadi.

('53', 154, 1, 2, 299161) of the Congress.
('53', 154, 1, 3, 299178) My view of the matter is that while it is of national importance that the requirements of the people of India should be met by cloth manufactured or made in the country, foreign cloth cannot be kept out unless and until the manufacturing capacity of India is considerably increased.
('53', 154, 1, 4, 299461) The problem then resolves itself into one of ways and means of promoting the indigenous industry.
('53', 154, 1, 5, 299559) One of the greatest obstacles in the way of such expansion is the organized competition which the industry is experiencing from Japan.
('53', 154, 1, 6, 299694) It may be that .
('53', 154, 1, 7, 299711) the competitive capacity of India may develop to an extent which would do away with the necessity of special measures of protection; but until that stage is reached, India must pursue a vigorous tariff policy.
('53', 154, 2, 8, 299921) And if I understand the purport of your recent announcement correctly, your attitude might be, that while you would not have a yard of Lancashire or any other foreign cloth in this country, if you could help it, you would not in certain circumstances mind Lancashire deriving some advantage over Japan owing to the special measures which it might be necessary to take to meet Japanese competition.
('53', 154, 2, 9, 300319) Will you kindly let me know if I have understood your position correctly?
('53', 154, 2, 10, 300393) My position is clear.
('53', 154, 2, 11, 300415) 1. If I had my way, India would be clothed in khadi to the exclusion of all other cloth even made in indigenous mills.
('53', 154, 2, 12, 300534) 2. Whilst India is unwilling (there is no question of inability) to manufacture all the khadi she needs, I should allow indigenous mill cloth to supplement it.
('53', 154, 2, 13, 300694) 3. There is picketing of foreign cloth because foreign cloth competes with both khadi and Indian mill cloth.
('53', 154, 2, 14, 300803) It is irrelevant, whether the competition is fair or unfair in the sense whether the cloth manufactured in the respective countries is fairly produced and brought here or not.
('53', 154, 2, 15, 300979) 4. If there was no competition, and if it became clear that some foreign cloth had to come to India, and if England was in partnership with India freed, I would give preference to England over all other countries.
('53', 154, 2, 16, 301193) But my belief is, that when India becomes free, she will manufacture within a short time enough khadi for her wants, supplementing it during the transition with indigenous mill cloth.

('53', 155, 1, 2, 301442) 165. WHAT WE CAN DO TODAY
('53', 155, 2, 3, 301468) The much criticized Fundamental Rights Resolution of the Karachi Congress has twenty items.
('53', 155, 2, 4, 301560) Item one has nine sub clauses.
('53', 155, 2, 5, 301591) I have just glanced through the innocent resolution, and I have made what is for me an amazing discovery which I am impatient to share with the reader.
('53', 155, 2, 6, 301743) I find that fifteen out of twenty we can enforce today more or less fully and five sub clauses of item one can be similarly treated.
('53', 155, 2, 7, 301876) Here they are for the convenience of the reader: 1
('53', 155, 3, 8, 301927) Those 2 omitted have reference to the things that can only be done by the legislature.
('53', 155, 3, 9, 302014) They are: Freedom of association and combination; Freedom of speech and Press; Right to bear arms; Right of personal liberty and possession of property without executive interference.
('53', 155, 3, 10, 302198) Religious neutrality by the State; Removal of salt duty; Control of currency for the benefit of the people; Control of key industries etc.
('53', 155, 3, 11, 302337) The reader will see that these last are really less vital than those we can do now without State assistance.
('53', 155, 3, 12, 302446) It will be seen further, that if we succeed in doing the things mentioned in the first list, those mentioned in the second will follow as a matter of course.
('53', 155, 3, 13, 302604) In other words national control of the Government is mostly dependent upon ourselves.
('53', 155, 3, 14, 302690) Conversely if we do not do the things we ought to today, when the power comes to us we shall be found unready for them.
('53', 155, 3, 15, 302810) Thus if we do not respect one anothers religions, do not treat women as absolute equals, do not remove untouchability, do not dot villages with free primary schools, do not honestly manage the Congress suffrage which is practically adult suffrage, do not treat labour decently, do not spare children factory labour, do not encourage labour unions, do not reduce agricultural rents, do not pay for

('53', 156, 1, 3, 303879) A popular State can never act in advance of public opinion.
('53', 156, 1, 4, 303939) If it goes against it, it will be destroyed.
('53', 156, 1, 5, 303984) Democracy disciplined and enlightened is the finest thing in the world.
('53', 156, 1, 6, 304056) A democracy prejudiced, ignorant, superstitious will land itself in chaos and may be self destroyed.
('53', 156, 1, 7, 304157) The Fundamental Rights Resolution is not premature.
('53', 156, 1, 8, 304209) It is not so formidable as it reads, if the nation is prepared, as I hold it is prepared, for orderly self government.
('53', 156, 1, 9, 304328) Let every Congressman therefore think out a programme of work for himself or herself in terms of the items first mentioned.
('53', 156, 1, 10, 304452) We need not be overpowered by the list.
('53', 156, 1, 11, 304492) Each one may take up the item and the area of work for which he or she is best fitted.
('53', 156, 1, 12, 304579) Needless to say the full working of the items requires the co operation of capitalists, landowners and the like.
('53', 156, 1, 13, 304692) They will all fall in line if a good beginning is made.

('53', 157, 3, 7, 305281) There are difficulties which may prove insuperable.

('53', 159, 8, 11, 307755) Asked about the situation in Borsad and Bardoli, Mr. Gandhi said: So far as Borsad is concerned, the Collector and I have exchanged communications after a prolonged conversation, but I am unable to give them to the public.
('53', 159, 8, 12, 307978) I am, however, hoping that most, if not all, the outstanding questions will be adjusted fairly and satisfac torily.
('53', 159, 8, 13, 308094) So far as Bardoli is concerned, communications are still going on with the Collector, but I am not without hope as to the final result.
('53', 159, 9, 14, 308230) Asked whether it was true, as reported in the Press, that the situation in U.P. was unlikely to interfere with his participation in the Round Table Conference,
('53', 159, 10, 15, 308390) Mr. Gandhi said: I hope the newspaper report about the U.P. situation is well warranted.
('53', 159, 10, 16, 308479) I have not yet heard directly from Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.
('53', 159, 11, 17, 308539) Asked whether he could now say if his going to the R.T.C. was in any way certain, Mr. Gandhi said: It is more than I can say, but I can say that I am trying my very best.
('53', 159, 12, 18, 308710) Asked his opinion about the article in The Manchester Guardian, a summary of which was published in the papers, Mr. Gandhi said: I have seen the Press summary of the Manchester Guardian article.
('53', 159, 12, 19, 308905) I can reciprocate much of what is said there.
('53', 159, 12, 20, 308951) Past experience however shows that one ought not to treat summaries as if they were the whole.
('53', 159, 12, 21, 309046) Subject to this caution, I can say that, if I do go to London, I shall not disappoint the hope entertained by Manchester Guardian.

('53', 160, 1, 2, 309221) So far as I am concerned, the embargo on foreign cloth is not and cannot be by way of reparation.
('53', 160, 1, 3, 309319) I dislike this repeated emphasis on British cloth.
('53', 160, 1, 4, 309370) British cloth is not objected to because it is British.
('53', 160, 1, 5, 309426) It is foreign cloth that is being attacked and in this attack if it becomes more successful, Japan would be the heaviest loser and not Lancashire.
('53', 160, 2, 6, 309573) Asked why he himself did not go to the North West Frontier Province, as desired, but sent his son Devdas Gandhi, Gandhiji said: I did not go to the North West Frontier Province in order to avoid any possible embarrassment to the Government.
('53', 160, 3, 7, 309814) Asked whether he would make any statement on the recent assassination of Mr. Garlick, District and Sessions Judge in Calcutta, Mr. Gandhi said: Coming as it does so soon after the attempted assassination of the Acting Governor of Bombay, it has very naturally caused stir and public resentment.
('53', 160, 3, 8, 310109) I have no doubt the coming All India Congress Committee meeting will deal with the situation.
('53', 160, 3, 9, 310203) I am more than ever convinced that every such murder does infinite injury to the cause of the countrys freedom.

('53', 160, 6, 18, 310824) To say such things to children sets them a wrong example.
('53', 160, 6, 19, 310882) But we should not feel hurt by these things; instead, we should try to solve the problem through love.

('53', 161, 2, 3, 311327) AHMEDABAD, August 1, 1931
('53', 161, 3, 4, 311353) DEAR MR. MAXWELL, I thank you for your letter of 28th ult.
('53', 161, 3, 5, 311412) regarding the cases of Pathan Abdul Ghaffar Khan and his son.
('53', 161, 3, 6, 311474) Though the information that you give me about them is instructive, the suspicion haunts me that their black record came to the surface and became relevant only when and because they took an active part in the civil disobedience movement.
('53', 161, 3, 7, 311712) Whether they received money for the part they played I am not aware.
('53', 161, 3, 8, 311781) You will be also interested to know that men with blacker records are at the present moment in the Government service and district officials have been good enough and frank enough to tell me that though they knew that these men had such a record, the Government could not afford to ignore the services that they had rendered to them at a critical time.
('53', 161, 3, 9, 312134) Nor am I able to understand the reasoning behind the decision.
('53', 161, 3, 10, 312197) If these men are such dangerous characters, will they cease to be so outside Bombay?
('53', 161, 3, 11, 312282) After all they are in British governed territories.
('53', 161, 3, 12, 312334) They have not been put outside the British limits.
('53', 161, 4, 13, 312385) Yours sincerely,

('53', 161, 7, 16, 312462) AHMEDABAD, August 1, 1931
('53', 161, 8, 17, 312488) DEAR MR. BHADRAPUR,
('53', 161, 9, 18, 312508) I now enclose herewith a report prepared by Sjt.
('53', 161, 9, 19, 312557) Mahadev Desai on the expert report prepared for you about the condition of Ras Khatedars.
('53', 161, 9, 20, 312647) This is how this report was prepared.
('53', 161, 9, 21, 312685) I sent Sjt.
('53', 161, 9, 22, 312697) Chhaganlal Joshi with Sjt.
('53', 161, 9, 23, 312724) Ravishanker to Ras to meet the Khatedars.
('53', 161, 9, 24, 312766) They were there practically a whole day.
('53', 161, 9, 25, 312807) They brought the results to Sjt.
('53', 161, 9, 26, 312840) Mahadev Desai who had previously conducted an exhaustive inquiry into the Ras cases and prepared an account of which an abstract was supplied to Mr. Perry.
('53', 161, 9, 27, 312996) A second exhaustive report was
('53', 162, 0, 1, 313027) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 163
('53', 162, 1, 2, 313071) prepared as a result of discussion with Mr. Perry which it became unnecessary to give to him as there was a sporting settlement.
('53', 162, 1, 3, 313200) This report deals with the crops of Khatedars and will be found annexed to the report sent herewith.
('53', 162, 1, 4, 313301) The present one is prepared in the light of these reports.
('53', 162, 1, 5, 313360) You will see that Schedule F of your report is the most important of all because it contains an examination of 126 Khatedars.
('53', 162, 1, 6, 313486) The annexure to the enclosed report is a complete answer to Schedule F. The other schedules relate to only 66 Khatedars.
('53', 162, 1, 7, 313607) The enclosed report deals with these and it appears to me a conclusive answer.
('53', 162, 1, 8, 313686) In the circumstances I have not the heart to ask any of the Khatedars to pay anything more.
('53', 162, 1, 9, 313778) As I told you, even the Rs. 500 was not exacted by me without some effort.
('53', 162, 1, 10, 313853) The reason is that the Ras Khatedars have been universally admitted to have been the heaviest losers.
('53', 162, 1, 11, 313955) But as I have told you already this does not mean that the Khatedars have no credit.
('53', 162, 1, 12, 314040) On the contrary their credit stands perhaps higher than before.
('53', 162, 1, 13, 314104) But it is common cause between the Government and the Congress that these civil resisters are not to be expected to borrow money in order to pay the revenue dues, whether current or arrears.
('53', 162, 1, 14, 314295) I enclose herewith the schedules you very kindly entrusted to my care.

('53', 163, 6, 14, 315482) You are cruel.
('53', 163, 6, 15, 315497) You say nothing about what happened to your daughter, whether you were leaving her in Rangoon or taking her.
('53', 163, 6, 16, 315606) But that is just like you, and I may not grumble.
('53', 163, 6, 17, 315656) Nothing is certain as yet about my going, but I might have to decide upon going even at the last moment.
('53', 163, 6, 18, 315761) I would therefore like you to come and see me wherever I am even after the All India Congress Committee meeting.
('53', 163, 6, 19, 315874) You can leave me after the 15th whether I stay or whether I go.
('53', 163, 6, 20, 315938) If you accept my proposal, I would then discuss with you your suggestion before adopting it.
('53', 163, 6, 21, 316031) I refer to the suggestion about giving an intimation to the Central Government that wherever picketing is unjustly interfered with, we might have to resist this interference with civil disobedience.

('53', 164, 1, 2, 316360) 178. MY NOTES
('53', 164, 2, 3, 316374) THE BENGAL MURDER 1
('53', 164, 3, 4, 316394) The murder of Judge Garlick coming, as it did, so close upon the assault on the Bombay Governor has naturally caused a great sensation.
('53', 164, 3, 5, 316530) Such assassinations make us hang our heads in shame.
('53', 164, 3, 6, 316583) They bring swaraj no nearer.
('53', 164, 3, 7, 316612) Nor do they help us to get better justice or reduce the prevailing hatred and bitterness.
('53', 164, 3, 8, 316702) The British have never run away for fear and are not likely to do so.
('53', 164, 3, 9, 316772) Such acts do not increase our capacity for constructive work or infuse greater fearlessness in the people.
('53', 164, 3, 10, 316879) The immediate consequences, as we see, are the very opposite.
('53', 164, 3, 11, 316941) For what can one blame Judge Garlick?
('53', 164, 3, 12, 316979) No matter how many persons he sentenced to death, he acted through no malicein doing so.
('53', 164, 3, 13, 317068) Whatever he did he did through a sense of duty.
('53', 164, 3, 14, 317116) Why should he be punished for that?
('53', 164, 3, 15, 317152) The assassin has lost his own life, but he has left behind him a legacy of suffering for others.
('53', 164, 3, 16, 317249) It will not help us in any way to cite the example of assassinations in other countries.
('53', 164, 3, 17, 317338) The evidence before our eyes should be enough to turn us away from the policy of violence.
('53', 164, 3, 18, 317429) That policy will spell our destruction.
('53', 164, 3, 19, 317469) In India we wish to bring about an awakening among the millions of our poor countrymen, for which thousands of us will have to labour ceaselessly and organize constructive work.
('53', 164, 3, 20, 317647) Can assassinations make any contribution to that end?
('53', 164, 3, 21, 317701) They not only cannot, but on the contrary they positively obstruct such efforts.
('53', 164, 3, 22, 317782) Will not the terrorists see this and desist from their activities?
('53', 164, 4, 23, 317849) SATYAGRAHA AND MORVI
('53', 164, 5, 24, 317870) Men from Kathiawar have been showering criticism on my article 2 regarding Morvi.
('53', 164, 5, 25, 317952) Some of the critics are sincere public servants.
('53', 164, 5, 26, 318001) Their enthusiasm is sincere but, I think, ignorant.
('53', 164, 5, 27, 318053) I have given no certificate to Morvi, and in any case who am I to give one?
('53', 164, 5, 28, 318129) Of course, I praised the ruler for what I thought his graceful action.
('53', 164, 5, 29, 318200) That does not, of course, condone the misdeeds of the State authorities, some of which I know and some I may not.
('53', 164, 5, 30, 318314) But that article was not intended to apportion blame, and hence it did not discuss the
('53', 164, 6, 31, 318401) 1 Vide also The Garlick Murder, 6 8 1931 2 Vide Morbis Lesson to Satyagrahis, 19 7 1931.
('53', 165, 0, 1, 318490) 166 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 165, 1, 2, 318532) question whether or not any atrocities on satyagrahis were committed and, if so, how cruel they were.
('53', 165, 1, 3, 318634) Even now I hold the opinion that the satyagrahi march on Morvi was hasty, to say the least.
('53', 165, 1, 4, 318726) That opinion was not based on any one sided evidence; if it was based on any evidence, then it was based on the admissions made by the satyagrahis themselves.
('53', 165, 1, 5, 318885) If the first step was wrong, then, not only should there be no objection to admitting as much, but it should be regarded ones duty to do so.
('53', 165, 1, 6, 319026) Moreover, it is a satyagrahis duty to regard his own errors as big as a mountain though they might be as small as a mole, and anothers as small as a mole though they might be as big as a mountain.
('53', 165, 1, 7, 319223) Such an attitude comes naturally to a satyagrahi and is not the result of a conscious effort.
('53', 165, 2, 8, 319317) HARIJANA
('53', 165, 3, 9, 319326) I asked serious readers of Navajivan to suggest to me a substitute for the word Antyaja.
('53', 165, 3, 10, 319415) One of the three or four suggestions received has appealed to me.
('53', 165, 3, 11, 319481) Shri Jagannath Desai writes from Rajkot: 1
('53', 165, 4, 12, 319524) Thus the word is not new, but a beautiful one already used by the father of Gujarati poetry.
('53', 165, 4, 13, 319617) Moreover, as used by him, the word Harijana can also mean men of God who are abandoned by society.
('53', 165, 4, 14, 319716) The third advantage of that word is that, probably, Antyaja brethren would lovingly accept that name and try to cultivate the virtues which it connotes.
('53', 165, 4, 15, 319869) Following the example of Kaliparaj becoming Raniparaj, may the Antyajas become Harijana both in name and nature.
('53', 165, 5, 16, 319982) FOREIGN TOYS AND CRACKERS
('53', 165, 6, 17, 320008) The leader of the Surat Childrens Army writes: 2
('53', 165, 7, 18, 320057) Personally, I approve of the boycott of both these.
('53', 165, 7, 19, 320109) Let the children carry out truly peaceful picketing.
('53', 165, 7, 20, 320162) If they secure the consent of the parents, that will be an education for the latter too.
('53', 165, 8, 21, 320251) 1 The letter is not translated here.
('53', 165, 8, 22, 320288) It said that the word Harijana was in use in many villages and Narasinh Mehta had used it to refer to Antyaja devotees.
('53', 165, 8, 23, 320408) 2 The letter is not translated here.

('53', 166, 1, 2, 320489) PATIENCE AND PURITY OF CONDUCT
('53', 166, 2, 3, 320520) A correspondent writes: 1
('53', 166, 3, 4, 320546) Nature has not revealed to us any method of immediately solving all our problems.
('53', 166, 3, 5, 320628) But that does not mean that [in an instance like this] there is no remedy.
('53', 166, 3, 6, 320703) The remedy is patience and right conduct.
('53', 166, 3, 7, 320745) Ones sister or brother in law or friend, whoever the person concerned, is sure ultimately to yield to our faith.
('53', 166, 4, 8, 320858) A SILENT WORKER
('53', 166, 5, 9, 320874) A large number of Indians live in Burma and make a living there.
('53', 166, 5, 10, 320939) Some of them also devote themselves to public service.
('53', 166, 5, 11, 320994) One such man was Vrajlal Mehta, whose death occurred a few days ago.
('53', 166, 5, 12, 321063) He carried on Congress work there, though we here have little knowledge of it.
('53', 166, 5, 13, 321142) He was a well to do man and contributed something to every fund and persuaded others to do the same.
('53', 166, 5, 14, 321243) But he sought no credit for doing this.
('53', 166, 5, 15, 321283) He was devoted to the poor, had full faith in the propagation of khadi and represented there the All India Spinners Association.
('53', 166, 5, 16, 321412) Those who seek no honour or reward but do service for its own sake deserve the highest honour.
('53', 166, 5, 17, 321507) Shri Vrajlal Mehta was a man of this kind.
('53', 166, 5, 18, 321550) We offer our compliments to his family for having produced such a person.

('53', 166, 7, 20, 321660) 179. SPEECH AT AHMEDABAD 2
('53', 166, 8, 21, 321687) August 2, 1931 I must say that the service of the so called untouchables does not rank with me as in any way subordinate to any kind of political work.
('53', 166, 8, 22, 321839) 3 Just a moment ago I met two missionary friends who drew the same distinction and therefore came in for some gentle rebuke from
('53', 166, 9, 23, 321968) 1 The letter is not translated here.
('53', 166, 9, 24, 322005) The correspondent had found it impossible to convert his relations and friends to swadeshi.
('53', 166, 9, 25, 322097) 2 At the opening of Sir Chinubhais family temple to the untouchables.
('53', 166, 9, 26, 322167) This is a condensed summary by Mahadev Desai which appeared under the caption Essentially a Reformer.
('53', 166, 9, 27, 322269) 3 Sir Chinubhai had remarked that whilst Gandhiji was preoccupied with things of great political importance, he should not have been asked to find time for a comparatively small thing.
('53', 167, 0, 1, 322454) 168 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 167, 1, 2, 322496) I suggested to them that my work of social reform was in no way less than or subordinate to political work.
('53', 167, 1, 3, 322604) The fact is, that when I saw that to a certain extent my social work would be impossible without the help of political work, I took to the latter and only to the extent that it helped the former.
('53', 167, 1, 4, 322800) I must therefore confess that work of social reform or self purification of this nature is a hundred times dearer to me than what is called purely political work.
('53', 167, 1, 5, 322963) For what does service of the untouchables or rendering justice to them mean?
('53', 167, 1, 6, 323040) It means nothing less than redeeming a debt which is centuries overdue, and to expiate in some measure the sin we have been guilty of for ages, viz., that of oppressing and insulting our own kith and kin.
('53', 167, 1, 7, 323245) We have behaved towards these unfortunate brethren of ours nothing better than a man turned monster behaves towards brother man.
('53', 167, 1, 8, 323374) And the programme of removal of untouchability that we have set before us is just some little expiation for a monstrous wrong.
('53', 167, 1, 9, 323501) And as it is essentially by way of expiation or self purification, it cannot be prompted by any fear or favour.
('53', 167, 1, 10, 323613) If we take up this work, fearing that the so called untouchables would go over to another faith, or that they would wreak vengeance on us, or as a sort of political trump card, we shall have betrayed our ignorance of Hinduism and our ungratefulness to those who have served us for ages.
('53', 167, 1, 11, 323900) I admit that it was I who pushed the item to the forefront of the Congress programme, and anyone bent on cavilling at me might say that it was a clever bait held out by me to the untouchables.
('53', 167, 1, 12, 324093) Let me say at once that that charge is idle.
('53', 167, 1, 13, 324138) It grew on me very early in life that those who believed themselves to be Hindus must perform the penance in the shape of wiping out this stain before they could be proud of Hinduism, and as the majority of Congressmen were Hindus, and as the programme then put before the nation was not one of self purification, I put it in the forefront of the Congress programme, in the conviction that unless the Hindus were prepared to wipe out this stain they could not regard themselves as fit for swaraj.
('53', 167, 1, 14, 324635) That conviction has come upon me as a self evident proposition.
('53', 167, 1, 15, 324699) If we came into power, with the stain of untouchability uneffaced, I am positive that the untouchables would be far worse under that swaraj than they are now, for the simple reason that our weaknesses and our failings would then be buttressed up by the accession of power.
('53', 167, 1, 16, 324972) That in brief is my position, and I have always held that self purification is an indispensable condition of swaraj.
('53', 167, 1, 17, 325089) It is not a position that I have arrived at today.
('53', 167, 1, 18, 325140) It is as old as when I began to think of swaraj.
('53', 167, 1, 19, 325189) That is
('53', 168, 0, 1, 325197) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 169
('53', 168, 1, 2, 325241) why I thank God for enabling me to participate in this function today.
('53', 168, 1, 3, 325312) I have always prized opportunities for doing this kind of work, and have often put aside so called political work for work of this nature.
('53', 168, 1, 4, 325451) I know that those to whom only the exciting thing called politics has an exclusive appeal will laugh at this kind of thing.
('53', 168, 1, 5, 325575) But for me it is nearest and dearest to my heart.
('53', 168, 1, 6, 325625) As for you, Lady Chinubhai, you need no congratulations from me for having done what was an obvious duty and an act of self purification.
('53', 168, 1, 7, 325763) But the occasion for my congratulations may, for aught we can say, soon arise.
('53', 168, 1, 8, 325842) The Brahmin priests in this temple have reconciled themselves today to the position.
('53', 168, 1, 9, 325927) But it is possible that they may one day turn against you and say that they would have nothing to do with worship in your temple.
('53', 168, 1, 10, 326057) Indeed the whole Brahmin community, the whole of the orthodox Nagar community may conspire against you.
('53', 168, 1, 11, 326161) Even then I hope and pray that you will hold fast to your conviction and rejoice in the belief that that day the stone image of Siva in the temple is invested with the living presence of God.
('53', 168, 1, 12, 326353) That will be the acme of your penance, and the day you are excommunicated by your community for having dared to do this necessary act of self purification, I shall congratulate you most heartily.
('53', 168, 1, 13, 326549) Let those who are present here today understand that we have not been able yet to win swaraj because of the load of sin that we are still carrying on our backs.
('53', 168, 1, 14, 326710) If all the so called touchable Hindus did real penance for having wronged their untouchable brethren, swaraj would be automatically in our hands.
('53', 168, 1, 15, 326856) And pray understand mere removal of physical untouchability does not mean expiation.
('53', 168, 1, 16, 326941) The removal of untouchability means the removal of all distinctions of superiority and inferiority attaching to birth.
('53', 168, 1, 17, 327060) Varnashramadharma 1 is a beautiful institution, but if it is used to buttress up social superiority of one section over another, it will be a monstrosity.
('53', 168, 1, 18, 327215) Let removal of untouchability result from a living conviction that all are one in the eyes of God, that the Father in Heaven will deal with us all with even handed justice.
('53', 168, 1, 19, 327388) This is a private temple, but if the doors of this private temple are thrown open to the untouchables how long will the doors of public temples here remain closed?
('53', 168, 1, 20, 327552) Let todays function be an eye opener to all the Hindus of Ahmedabad.

('53', 169, 1, 2, 327725) auspicious beginning of a process which will end in throwing open all the Hindu temples of Ahmedabad to the untouchables.
('53', 169, 1, 3, 327847) But even there as in every other thing I should ask you to avoid compulsion.
('53', 169, 1, 4, 327924) Untouchability cannot long endure.
('53', 169, 1, 5, 327959) Some years ago we obstinately clung to it, today we are indifferent.
('53', 169, 1, 6, 328028) It will be a thing of the past only when the indifference is translated into a conscious deliberate awakening to a sense of the duty of self purification.
('53', 169, 1, 7, 328183) Even the indifference or sufferance would have been impossible fifteen years ago.
('53', 169, 1, 8, 328265) The willing act of self purification will, let us hope and pray, be the next step.
('53', 169, 1, 9, 328348) Only the other day a friend suggested to me that the word Harijana (man of God) be substituted for the word Antyaja (the last born) that is being used for untouchables.
('53', 169, 1, 10, 328517) It was a word used by the great saint Narasinha Mehta, who by the bye belonged to the Nagar Brahmin community and who defied the whole community by claiming the untouchables as his own.
('53', 169, 1, 11, 328703) I am delighted to adopt that word which is sanctified by having been used by such a great saint, but it has for me a deeper meaning than you may imagine.
('53', 169, 1, 12, 328857) The untouchable, to me, is, compared to us, really a Harijanaa man of God, and we are Durjana (men of evil).
('53', 169, 1, 13, 328966) For whilst the untouchable has toiled and moiled and dirtied his hands so that we may live in comfort and cleanliness; we have delighted in suppressing him.
('53', 169, 1, 14, 329123) We are solely responsible for all the shortcomings and faults that we lay at the door of these untouchables.
('53', 169, 1, 15, 329232) It is still open to us to be Harijana ourselves, but we can only do so by heartily repenting of our sin against them.

('53', 170, 6, 11, 330559) Interviewed [in Bombay], he did not throw any light on the result of his conversations with the Governor of Bombay at Poona.
('53', 170, 6, 12, 330684) He thought, on the other hand, it was really for the Government to say whatever they considered was convenient and proper.

('53', 172, 0, 1, 332995) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 173
('53', 172, 1, 2, 333039) 185. FURTHER CLEARANCE
('53', 172, 2, 3, 333062) Having read my reply to him in Young India, 1 Sjt.
('53', 172, 2, 4, 333113) Satyamurti thus returns to the charge:
('53', 172, 3, 5, 333152) Your insistence on the statement that political power is not an end in itself disturbs me seriously.
('53', 172, 3, 6, 333253) Even if tomorrow we get all the reforms we want, I would still resist British rule in this country.
('53', 172, 3, 7, 333353) I am also convinced that very few of the reforms we want can be fully or effectively achieved, unless we get political power.
('53', 172, 4, 8, 333479) You must recognize that the ideal of political anarchy, with which I entirely agree, is not practical politics in the world today.
('53', 172, 4, 9, 333610) If the Mussalmans and the Sikhs, therefore, get all the power, the majority community in the country will have to be perpetual civil resisters, leading to civil war.
('53', 172, 5, 10, 333776) I agree that political power can easily become a burden if it came as a gift from without, the people having made no effort to deserve it.
('53', 172, 5, 11, 333915) But I claim that the nation has already shown, and will show increasingly in the next few years, that it fully deserves political power.
('53', 172, 6, 12, 334052) Public opinion, I agree, should support legislation.
('53', 172, 6, 13, 334105) Legislation in advance of public opinion is often futile.
('53', 172, 6, 14, 334163) But public opinion, without legislative sanction, is often very largely impotent.
('53', 172, 6, 15, 334245) I feel that political power is the thing, and that these reforms must follow.
('53', 172, 6, 16, 334323) After all, the freedom of a nation and the liberty of the individual are priceless political privileges; and each nation must be free to decide what is good for itself.
('53', 172, 6, 17, 334492) Once, therefore, we get political power, we can and ought to decide what is good for us.
('53', 172, 6, 18, 334581) And if I understand my countrymen aright, the largest public opinion in India today is in favour of getting political power.
('53', 172, 7, 19, 334706) If you think this letter deserves a further answer from you, I shall be glad to have it.
('53', 172, 7, 20, 334795) But may I again express the hope that you may reconsider your position in the light of what I have stated above?
('53', 172, 8, 21, 334908) As regards my previous letter, I am sorry it has not reached you.
('53', 172, 8, 22, 334974) I have no copy of it.
('53', 172, 8, 23, 334996) I wanted to know in that letter from you what the phrase for presenting the demands of the Congress, in the resolution 2 of the Working Committee, deputing you to attend the Round Table Conference, meant.
('53', 172, 8, 24, 335201) I take it, it does not mean that you will merely state the Congress case, in the attitude of take it or leave it.
('53', 172, 8, 25, 335315) But I presume that you will (I) state the
('53', 172, 9, 26, 335357) 1 Vide Power Not An End, 2 7 1931 2 Of June 9, vide footnote 1, Substance Not Shadow,18 6 1931

('53', 173, 1, 3, 335860) There seems to me to be a question of emphasis between Sjt.
('53', 173, 1, 4, 335920) Satyamurti and myself.
('53', 173, 1, 5, 335943) His emphasis is on political power in itself, mine on political power as a weapon for enabling the reformer to achieve his reforms in the quickest manner possible.
('53', 173, 1, 6, 336107) To me therefore all depends upon the way political power is attained.
('53', 173, 1, 7, 336177) If it cannot be attained without the combined exertion of all the communities, I would wait.
('53', 173, 1, 8, 336270) After all a strenuous exertion itself is a getting.
('53', 173, 1, 9, 336322) In that sense political power is daily coming to the nation.
('53', 173, 1, 10, 336383) A constitution will merely be a symbol of the full achievement.
('53', 173, 1, 11, 336447) But it may also be a mirage, if it is not consciously a fruition of a nations endeavour.
('53', 173, 1, 12, 336536) Thus supposing by some accident England collapsed all of a sudden and therefore India imagined that she had all she wanted, she would be wholly wrong.
('53', 173, 1, 13, 336687) Virtue therefore lies in our getting political power as a result of our strength, not as a result of the foreign rulers weakness.
('53', 173, 1, 14, 336817) But I must not labour the point any further.
('53', 173, 1, 15, 336862) It is enough that just at present, though I may have a different outlook from that of many others, we are all striving for the same thing in the same way.
('53', 173, 1, 16, 337017) I do not share the fear, that if Mussalmans and Sikhs got all the power, the majority community, i.e., Hindus would have to be perpetual civil resisters.
('53', 173, 1, 17, 337171) In the first instance this deduction ignores the assumption that Hindus willingly surrendered their right to power, and in the second it ignores the law of civil resistance that it is never needed to be applied perpetually to a cause.
('53', 173, 1, 18, 337406) Its sovereign efficacy lies in the fact that it secures redress within a measurable though previously unascertainable period.
('53', 173, 1, 19, 337532) I can give Sjt.
('53', 173, 1, 20, 337548) Satyamurti a more consoling answer regarding his doubts as to the meaning of the presentation of Congress demands.
('53', 173, 1, 21, 337663) Subject of course to permission being granted,and this, in my opinion, is implicit in the Delhi Settlement,I am going to present and support the Congress case with arguments, meet counter argu ments and answer questions and try to solve difficulties and doubts raised by the other side and exercise the freedom given by the Karachi Congress to the Congress Delegation to the Round Table Conference to accept such adjustments as may be demonstrably

('53', 174, 1, 3, 338192) If I reach London, I can make this promise to all concerned, that whilst on the one hand I will not be guilty of selling the national cause, on the other the most reactionary Englishman need have no cause to fear my reputed obstinacy, or worse still, anti British feelings.
('53', 174, 1, 4, 338466) I am not conscious of being obstinate.
('53', 174, 1, 5, 338505) Those who know me, have always credited me with an ample faculty for compromise though they have found me unyielding on matters of principle.
('53', 174, 1, 6, 338647) Nor am I conscious of any anti British feeling in me.
('53', 174, 1, 7, 338701) On the contrary, I can assert with confidence that I have nothing but goodwill for the British.
('53', 174, 1, 8, 338797) If therefore I attend the Conference, I shall leave no stone unturned to make the deliberations of the Conference a success.
('53', 174, 1, 9, 338922) More I dare not promise.

('53', 174, 4, 12, 338999) A correspondent from Abiramam writes: Mudukulattur is a fairly big village in the district of Ramnand in the Madras Presidency.
('53', 174, 4, 13, 339127) By 1 a short cut route, 8 miles in distance from the town lies the blue sea.
('53', 174, 4, 14, 339204) After the Settlement the villagers began to carry salt from the sea bed.
('53', 174, 4, 15, 339277) No conveyance was used at first.
('53', 174, 4, 16, 339310) Each man took as much salt as he could conveniently carry.
('53', 174, 4, 17, 339369) Men were not molested by the salt officers.
('53', 174, 4, 18, 339413) Emboldened by the apparent inactivity of salt officers, people used to join in the common purpose of carrying salt in groups consisting of four or five persons.
('53', 174, 4, 19, 339574) From the beginning of last month country bullock carts were requisitioned and used for carrying salt, and the commodity was divided into equal lots by those who brought them to be used for each mans family consumption.
('53', 174, 4, 20, 339793) At this stage of their activities only did the emissaries of the department think it their duty to interfere.
('53', 174, 4, 21, 339903) After a full consultation, as to the nature of the action to be taken with regard to the people who carried away salt in carts, it was thought fit to arrest certain persons and fine them for the offence of breaking the provisions of the salt law.
('53', 174, 4, 22, 340150) It should be stated that the officers did not at all interfere at the very beginning.
('53', 174, 4, 23, 340236) They wished to check them at a very late hour, and this they did without giving them any notice or even a casual warning.
('53', 174, 5, 24, 340358) 1 The source has From, evidently a misprint.
('53', 175, 0, 1, 340403) 176 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 175, 1, 2, 340445) The total number of persons thus arrested is 21. The punishment meted out to them varied.
('53', 175, 1, 3, 340535) Those who admitted the guilt were let off with small fines, while those who refused to admit it were fined heavier than the others.
('53', 175, 1, 4, 340667) The total amount of fines amounted to Rs. 295 which was paid.
('53', 175, 1, 5, 340729) I am quite sure that these prosecutions could have been avoided if the local Congress authorities had done propaganda work and informed the villagers of the limits of the salt concession.
('53', 175, 1, 6, 340917) Can you not wake them up from their lethargy?
('53', 175, 1, 7, 340963) I assure you that the villagers are quite amenable to reason.
('53', 175, 1, 8, 341025) I have condensed the original letter.
('53', 175, 1, 9, 341063) I do not know how far the complaint against the local Congress Committees is justified.
('53', 175, 1, 10, 341151) But one is inclined to agree with the writer that there has been some negligence.
('53', 175, 1, 11, 341233) The salt concession is the most valuable clause of the Delhi Settlement.
('53', 175, 1, 12, 341306) I know that Lord Irwin was moved by the appeal on behalf of the poor.
('53', 175, 1, 13, 341376) I am betraying no confidence when I state that he realized that at least for the poor villagers salt must be free as air and water.
('53', 175, 1, 14, 341508) The argument that it was not so much the amount of tax that positively hurt the people as the deprivation of the right of making it themselves made a forcible appeal to him.
('53', 175, 1, 15, 341682) If it makes the same appeal to Congressmen, they will lose no time in instructing the villagers as to the exact nature of the concession.
('53', 175, 1, 16, 341820) There is no complication about it.
('53', 175, 1, 17, 341855) The villagers within a walking distance of a salt area whether sea bound or inland can make and sell salt for domestic consumption.
('53', 175, 1, 18, 341987) Domestic use includes use for manure, cattle and fish curing as a village industry.
('53', 175, 1, 19, 342071) Therefore salt cannot be carried to towns or bazars outside the walking area.
('53', 175, 1, 20, 342149) It can on no account be carted or carried on camelback.
('53', 175, 1, 21, 342205) Only human agency is permissible.
('53', 175, 1, 22, 342239) Not even hand carts may be used.
('53', 175, 1, 23, 342272) These limitations may look formidable to town dwellers.
('53', 175, 1, 24, 342328) They are no hardships for the villagers who want to work the concession honestly.
('53', 175, 1, 25, 342410) The motive behind the limitation is to prevent trade among the wealthy people and competition with the monopoly salt in areas where people use the monopoly salt without noticing the effect of the tax.
('53', 175, 1, 26, 342611) Whilst the latter lasts, the restriction is perfectly intelligible and reasonable.
('53', 175, 1, 27, 342694) Let us realize, that for tens of thousands who live within walking distance of salt areas salt is free.
('53', 175, 1, 28, 342798) From all I have seen of the working of this concession, I believe that the provincial Governments are

('53', 176, 1, 2, 342944) desirous of giving the villagers the full benefit of the concession.
('53', 176, 1, 3, 343013) Having made this admission, I would like to suggest that the fines imposed were heavy.
('53', 176, 1, 4, 343100) A few pice each should surely have sufficed by way of warning.
('53', 176, 1, 5, 343163) Nor can I help feeling that the reported distinction between those who pleaded guilty and those who did not was wholly unnecessary.

('53', 176, 2, 7, 343317) 187. WHAT IS LIBERTY ?
('53', 176, 3, 8, 343340) In the course of a letter eulogizing the non violent character of our struggle, a country clerk writing from Vernon, Texas, says:
('53', 176, 4, 9, 343470) Usually men think of liberty as the absence of restraint.
('53', 176, 4, 10, 343528) That may be liberty, but usually it is licence.
('53', 176, 4, 11, 343576) The absence of negation to personal desire is never liberty.
('53', 176, 4, 12, 343637) Liberty is that which makes a man free in the face of great obstacles.
('53', 176, 4, 13, 343708) It is one of lifes virtues least understood and not often practised.
('53', 176, 4, 14, 343777) Liberty is not a varying quality, but a fixed life principle.
('53', 176, 5, 15, 343839) True liberty often does strange things.
('53', 176, 5, 16, 343879) In fact the actors are frequently called fools.
('53', 176, 5, 17, 343927) At any rate they do not seem to work for their own interest, but when rightly understood, liberty is seen to be an exhibition of service, if not of sacrifice.
('53', 176, 5, 18, 344086) Conscious liberty lifts a man above the sordid and selfish to a view of the common good.
('53', 176, 5, 19, 344175) It puts a premium on larger benefits and teaches her devotee to consider himself part of a great principle working for human uplift.
('53', 176, 5, 20, 344308) His reward lies not in material gains, but in a larger truer self conscious strength.

('53', 176, 6, 22, 344416) 188. THE GARLICK MURDER
('53', 176, 7, 23, 344440) This murder in Bengal of a judge who was performing his duty according to his lights is a disgrace to the perpetrators.
('53', 176, 7, 24, 344560) We may not wonder at the agitation that has troubled the European community in Calcutta and elsewhere.
('53', 176, 7, 25, 344663) The young men who delight in murdering those whom they dislike, no matter from how patriotic motive, do not advance the cause they claim to espouse.
('53', 176, 7, 26, 344812) And murders planned by secret societies make everyone in their immediate neighbourhood a suspect.
('53', 176, 7, 27, 344910) Indeed one murder of a European official affects the atmosphere in the whole of India.
('53', 176, 7, 28, 344997) It is the duty of every person who sincerely dislikes these
('53', 177, 0, 1, 345057) 178 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 177, 1, 2, 345099) murders to express his strong disapproval of such acts, and wherever he can find the followers of the cult of murder, reason with its members and non co operate with them if they do not listen.
('53', 177, 1, 3, 345293) Satyagraha is no respecter of persons.
('53', 177, 1, 4, 345332) Given a correct atmosphere satyagraha can be far more effectively used against our own friends than against those who regard us as their enemies.
('53', 177, 1, 5, 345478) The nearer the relation, the more effective does satyagraha become.
('53', 177, 1, 6, 345546) We must realize that any toleration or indifference shown towards these activities will not only postpone swaraj, but will make swaraj government difficult, if not impossible.
('53', 177, 1, 7, 345722) For, whilst it may be possible for an overarmed alien Government to carry on adminis tration in spite of the activities of murderous secret societies, an administration based purely on popular will cannot be efficiently conducted in the midst of murderous activities.
('53', 177, 1, 8, 345990) There is no warrant to suppose, that if the idea that it is right to murder officials or persons whom we dislike becomes popular, it will subside the moment we gain swaraj.
('53', 177, 1, 9, 346163) From even the most selfish considerations, therefore, it is necessary for lovers of real freedom to put forth their best endeavour to check this evil before it becomes too late.
('53', 177, 1, 10, 346341) I have had it whispered to me, that violence going on side by side with non violence must help the latter.
('53', 177, 1, 11, 346448) As the author of the non violent programme and as an expert in the line, let me proclaim with all the strength of conviction that it is a serious delusion to think that violence can help non violence.
('53', 177, 1, 12, 346649) On this matter my evidence based on long experience should be regarded as conclusive.
('53', 177, 1, 13, 346735) I can assert that every act of political violence injures the non violent movement.
('53', 177, 1, 14, 346819) Everyone knows how it unnerves me.
('53', 177, 1, 15, 346854) What has been called the Bardoli blunder and what I claim as an act of first class wisdom was due to an ugly outbreak of violence on the part of professing Congressmen at Chauri Chaura 1. But for the postponement of civil disobedience at the time, the country would not have made the phenomenal progress it has made.
('53', 177, 1, 16, 347171) Let everyone concerned understand that if this contagion of murder spreads, without my wishing it or doing it, the active non violent movement may automatically suffer a check.
('53', 177, 1, 17, 347348) Like everything in nature it has its own law to govern it.
('53', 177, 1, 18, 347407) It may not be amiss here to examine the resentment caused in European circles over my article 2 on the attempted assassination of His

('53', 178, 1, 2, 347627) Excellency the Acting Governor of Bombay.
('53', 178, 1, 3, 347669) The resentment was caused by my making a distinction between the murder of a guest by a host and any other murder.
('53', 178, 1, 4, 347784) I thought that I had made my meaning quite clear.
('53', 178, 1, 5, 347834) I heightened the sinfulness of the act because of the additional fact that Sir Earnest Hotson was a guest of the College.
('53', 178, 1, 6, 347956) Of course every murder is sinful and deserving of condemnation.
('53', 178, 1, 7, 348020) But there are surely degrees of guilt even about these acts.
('53', 178, 1, 8, 348081) And it has often happened before now that some special ugliness about such acts has stirred the conscience of those concerned and arrested the growth of the disease.
('53', 178, 1, 9, 348247) It was with that object in view that I drew the distinction and pointed out the gravity of murderous acts.
('53', 178, 1, 10, 348354) I know as a matter of fact that the article has affected some of those whom it was intended to influence.
('53', 178, 1, 11, 348460) I ask my European critics to be patient with me.
('53', 178, 1, 12, 348509) I understand their irritation.
('53', 178, 1, 13, 348540) But they will not improve the situation by losing their balance and suspecting where there is no ground for suspicion.

('53', 180, 3, 7, 350019) But I would urge you not to think that a parent has any necessary authority over his or her grown up children.
('53', 180, 3, 8, 350130) We as parents are likely to lose our influence over our children, if we claim authority over them.
('53', 180, 3, 9, 350229) It is only a silken cord that binds us to our grown up children.

('53', 181, 2, 3, 351528) August 6, 1931
('53', 181, 3, 4, 351543) Mahatma Gandhi proposed the following resolution: The A.I.C.C. deplores the attempted assassination of H.E the Acting Governor of Bombay and the assassination of Judge Garlick in Bengal.
('53', 181, 3, 5, 351730) While condemning all political murders, 1 the A.I.C.C. regards the attempted assassination of the acting Governor of Bombay as the more condemnable inasmuch as it was an act done by a student of a college that had invited the Acting Governor as its honoured guest.
('53', 181, 3, 6, 351995) The A.I.C.C. warns those who secretly or openly approve of or encourage such murders that they retard the progress of the country.
('53', 181, 3, 7, 352126) The A.I.C.C. calls upon Congress organizations to carry on special propaganda against all acts of public violence even where provocation is given for such deeds.
('53', 181, 3, 8, 352288) Further the A.I.C.C. appeals to the nationalist Press to use all its influence in this behalf.
('53', 181, 4, 9, 352383) Speaking on the resolution Gandhiji said: I hope you all have understood the meaning of this resolution and therefore I do not want to burden you with a Hindustani translation of it.
('53', 181, 4, 10, 352566) I want to tell you that there is much more in my heart than what I have stated here.
('53', 181, 4, 11, 352651) I tell you this because I have framed the resolution myself and because I know how far I can carry you with me.
('53', 181, 4, 12, 352763) I have also to inform you that there was no difference among the members of the Working Committee on this resolution and I hope that in this House also there will be no difference of opinion on it.
('53', 181, 4, 13, 352961) But still I do not want you to accept it without argument or discussion.
('53', 181, 4, 14, 353034) I want you to express your views on it and if you do not agree with it throw it out.
('53', 181, 4, 15, 353119) This resolution has not been brought forward to deceive ourselves or Englishmen or the world at large.
('53', 181, 4, 16, 353222) It has been moved todeclare what is the creed of the Congress.
('53', 181, 4, 17, 353285) The creed of the Congress is to strive for the attainment of purna swaraj by non violent and peaceful means.
('53', 181, 4, 18, 353394) We have decided to follow the path of peace, truth and righteousness.
('53', 181, 4, 19, 353464) And so long as we believe in it andwant the world also to believe that that is our way, then it becomes obligatory upon us
('53', 181, 5, 20, 353587) 1 A verbal amendment by Bhaisaheb Kotwal to add here the words and attempts to murder was later accepted.

('53', 182, 1, 2, 353737) to stick to it scrupulously in thought, word and deed.
('53', 182, 1, 3, 353792) It also becomes our duty to prevent those who want to follow the opposite way.
('53', 182, 1, 4, 353871) We must try to win them over.
('53', 182, 1, 5, 353901) In 1920 when the Congress first adopted non violence as its creed the argument was brought forward why the Congress should take any notice of what those who were not members of the Congress did.
('53', 182, 1, 6, 354096) It was said that while Congress should follow its own way it should allow others to do what they liked.
('53', 182, 1, 7, 354200) It was said that if Congress wanted it should stick to non violence and even submit patiently to violence used against it by its opponents, but it has no business to advise others or come in their way.
('53', 182, 1, 8, 354402) Since the time this controversy started my reply to it has been that the Congress claims to represent and speak in the name of India and the fight it has been carrying on is for the good of every Indian whether he is a Hindu, a Muslim, a Christian or a Parsi.
('53', 182, 1, 9, 354662) We claim to exert influence on them and we represent them and speak in their name.
('53', 182, 1, 10, 354745) Our fight is not for Congressmen alone.
('53', 182, 1, 11, 354785) If it were so our task would have been very simple.
('53', 182, 1, 12, 354837) Last year when we carried on the struggle for freedom against the Government, the whole country was at our back.
('53', 182, 1, 13, 354950) All those who participated in the struggle were not Congress members.
('53', 182, 1, 14, 355020) But our strength is immensely increased by working for them and accepting their help.
('53', 182, 1, 15, 355106) The Government admits the strength of the Congress not because there are some thousand members on the roll of the Congress or there are a few lawyers, doctors or other learned men in the Congress who can very well argue and discuss things.
('53', 182, 1, 16, 355346) The Government recognizes the strength of the Congress because it feels that the voice of the Congress has reached the villages.
('53', 182, 1, 17, 355475) Do you believe that if you declared that you have nothing to do with the masses and your fight was only for the members of the Congress your word will carry the same weight as it does today?
('53', 182, 1, 18, 355666) Our strength has now increased to the extent that even in the remote corners of the country where our voice has not so far reached, where the people have not yet seen the Congress flag, our influence is felt.
('53', 182, 1, 19, 355875) It is true that all the seven hundred thousand villages of India have not Congress organizations but we are confident that when we go there our voice is heard and the people follow our advice.
('53', 182, 1, 20, 356068) Those who commit murders are also our brethren.
('53', 182, 1, 21, 356116) We must exert influence on them.
('53', 182, 1, 22, 356149) When we claim to represent them we also must accept the responsibility for what they do.
('53', 182, 1, 23, 356238) In 1921 we had made it clear that we shall be responsible for the actions of the non Con

('53', 183, 1, 5, 356524) 1 I am prepared to say that we did not suffer any loss because we suspended our fight on previous occasions.
('53', 183, 1, 6, 356633) On the contrary I believe that we have distinctly gained thereby.
('53', 183, 1, 7, 356699) There is still a large number of people who say that I committed a blunder when I stopped the fight in Bardoli in 1922. They say that if we had continued our fight then by this time we could have been free.
('53', 183, 1, 8, 356906) I believe it is a mistake to think so.
('53', 183, 1, 9, 356945) It is even now my firm belief that what I did in Bardoli in 1922 was right and India has immensely gained by that action.
('53', 183, 1, 10, 357067) The present awakening in the country is due to that action.
('53', 183, 1, 11, 357127) If you do not believe in it, if your opinion differs then say so.
('53', 183, 1, 12, 357193) You must have the courage to say so.
('53', 183, 1, 13, 357230) But if you believe that what we have been doing since 1922 up till now is right then it becomes your duty to adopt this resolution and to work for it.
('53', 183, 1, 14, 357381) On former occasions when we condemned such actions we also praised the spirit of sacrifice among the young men.
('53', 183, 1, 15, 357493) But we praised it so much that I think we reached the limit when we passed the resolution at Karachi about Bhagat Singh and his comrades.
('53', 183, 1, 16, 357631) At that time I felt that for one whose sacrifice was so great and whose character was represented to me to have been spotless we should do all that we can to save him from the gallows and even if we did not succeed in it we should pass the resolution we passed.
('53', 183, 1, 17, 357893) I did so in the belief that it would have sobering effect on the youths but I failed in that attempt.
('53', 183, 1, 18, 357995) I am not unaware of the increased strength of the youths but it is being misused.
('53', 183, 1, 19, 358077) I did not get the least success in that attempt.
('53', 183, 1, 20, 358126) On the contrary it was exploited very badly and I am sorry for it.
('53', 183, 1, 21, 358193) There are those who accuse me of agreeing to that proposition at Karachi dishonestly because I wanted to placate the youths as I had to carry the Congress with me in ratifying the Delhi Pact and attend the R.T.C. My reply to these critics is that you cannot claim to know what is in my mind.
('53', 183, 1, 22, 358485) It is God alone who knows that.
('53', 183, 1, 23, 358517) But I can say this much that I shall never commit such blunder.
('53', 183, 1, 24, 358581) If I do I shall not be true to the Congress.
('53', 183, 1, 25, 358626) For others it may be a question of mere policy but for me it is my dharma.
('53', 183, 1, 26, 358701) How is it possible for me to commit such a grave blunder for a small matter?
('53', 183, 1, 27, 358778) I have never done it in my life.
('53', 183, 2, 28, 358811) 1 In 1919 the Rowlatt Act Satyagraha was suspended because of the outbreak of violence.
('53', 184, 0, 1, 358899) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 185
('53', 184, 1, 2, 358943) do not attach so much value to the R.T.C. as to sacrifice that great principle of my life for it.
('53', 184, 1, 3, 359041) I certainly attach more value to the Delhi Pact.
('53', 184, 1, 4, 359090) We have been benefited by it and I do not even now feel that we were mistaken in agreeing to it.
('53', 184, 1, 5, 359187) I felt that we would profit by its acceptance and I see that we have gained much thereby and will gain more in future.
('53', 184, 1, 6, 359306) You may think that it is worth consigning to the waste paper basket.
('53', 184, 1, 7, 359375) But nothing could convince me that it was a mistake.
('53', 184, 1, 8, 359428) I am also aware of the objection raised, namely, why the crimes of our young men are magnified, while the Government whose faults drive our young men to commit such actions is not criticized.
('53', 184, 1, 9, 359620) I do not know if there is any need on the part of the Congress to do that work.
('53', 184, 1, 10, 359700) Those who demand such condemnation of the Government by the Congress do not understand the Congress.
('53', 184, 1, 11, 359801) The very existence of the Congress is to destroy the present system of Government.
('53', 184, 1, 12, 359884) The Congress wants to put a stop to what has been going on for years in this country.
('53', 184, 1, 13, 359970) The Congress decided it when it first launched the non co operation movement.
('53', 184, 1, 14, 360048) The vices of this Government have not since decreased, on the contrary they have increased.
('53', 184, 1, 15, 360140) The youths who commit such acts do so as a result of their being driven to desperation but that does not mean that we should not say that they are mistaken.
('53', 184, 2, 16, 360297) To recite the wrongs of the Government at the time of condemning political murders is to confuse the issue, and to mislead the hot blooded youth.
('53', 184, 2, 17, 360443) We must tell them in the clearest possible language, that they must cease to murder, no matter how great may be the provocation.
('53', 184, 2, 18, 360572) But how, it is further asked, can you end the present system by the way of non violence?
('53', 184, 2, 19, 360661) Surely the progress made by the country since 1920 is sufficient tangible proof of the success.
('53', 184, 2, 20, 360757) But whether we shall succeed or not is not the question.
('53', 184, 2, 21, 360814) There is the Congress creed, and we have to work it out faithfully.
('53', 184, 2, 22, 360882) Hence we must not in any shape or form identify ourselves with the murderous activities that we witness about us.
('53', 184, 2, 23, 360996) It would be perfectly legitimate for those who do not believe in the Congress creed to agitate for its removal, and there will be no need for such a resolution as the one before you.
('53', 184, 2, 24, 361179) We must not deceive ourselves or the world.
('53', 184, 2, 25, 361223) And now a word to the nationalist newspapers.
('53', 184, 2, 26, 361269) They can help a
('53', 184, 3, 27, 361285) 1 What follows is from Young India as reported by Mahadev Desai.
('53', 185, 0, 1, 361350) 186 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 185, 1, 2, 361392) great deal if they will.
('53', 185, 1, 3, 361417) One often sees glaring headlines in them suggestive of approval of political murder.
('53', 185, 1, 4, 361502) Let them therefore beware of the slightest suggestion of encouragement to violence.
('53', 185, 1, 5, 361586) I am told by young men, that if I cannot help them I should keep quiet, but not hinder them.
('53', 185, 1, 6, 361679) My answer to them is: if you must kill English officials, why not kill me instead?
('53', 185, 1, 7, 361762) I plead guilty to the charge of putting an obstacle in your way in my own way.
('53', 185, 1, 8, 361841) It is my creed.
('53', 185, 1, 9, 361857) Have no mercy on me and despatch me straightway.
('53', 185, 1, 10, 361906) But so long as there is breath in me, I must resist you in the manner I know.
('53', 185, 1, 11, 361984) If you will spare me, do not lay hands on Government servants, be they big or small.
('53', 185, 2, 12, 362069) Concluding, Mahatma Gandhi referred to the conduct of some nationalist
('53', 185, 3, 13, 362140) papers which he did not find quite in keeping with the principle of non violence.
('53', 185, 4, 14, 362222) wanted them to be careful in that respect.
('53', 185, 4, 15, 362265) He felt it was needed that they should admit
('53', 185, 5, 16, 362310) in fairness that they had erred and try to improve their conduct.
('53', 185, 5, 17, 362376) He added that as he
('53', 185, 6, 18, 362396) could praise their achievements he could also look to things as a critic and if their
('53', 185, 7, 19, 362482) virtues could be compared to Himalayas their mistakes also would be as great as
('53', 185, 8, 20, 362562) Vindhyas.
('53', 185, 8, 21, 362572) He again repeated his appeal to the A.l.C.C. members to accept the
('53', 185, 9, 22, 362639) resolution or to reject it.
('53', 185, 10, 23, 362667) Replying to the debate Gandhiji said that when Sjt.
('53', 185, 10, 24, 362719) Abhyankar levelled charges against him of not listening to the amendments or the speeches on them he readily pleaded guilty.
('53', 185, 10, 25, 362844) They al!
('53', 185, 10, 26, 362853) knew that he had certain habits whether good or bad and to them he wanted to stick.
('53', 185, 10, 27, 362937) He had therefore to leave the meeting with the permission of the President.
('53', 185, 10, 28, 363013) As he had not listened to the speeches of those who moved the amendments and therefore in fact he had no right to reply but if they permitted he would speak.
('53', 185, 10, 29, 363171) He knew they were very indulgent to him.
('53', 185, 10, 30, 363212) He thanked them for it.
('53', 185, 10, 31, 363236) He was now growing old and therefore they should not expect him to work with the same energy as he was doing formerly.
('53', 185, 10, 32, 363355) He was trying to reserve his energy but wanted them to rest assured that it would be utilized for national service.
('53', 185, 11, 33, 363471) Some of the speakers have appealed to me to add words containing a reference to Government.
('53', 185, 11, 34, 363563) Abhyankar has credited me with the courage of confessing Himalayan blunders and with being supremely reasonable.
('53', 185, 11, 35, 363676) Well, then, I may tell him, that it is because of my reasonableness that I cannot accept the suggestions for all that he wants is contained in the words even where provocation is
('53', 185, 12, 36, 363855) 1 What follows is from The Bombay Chronicle.
('53', 185, 12, 37, 363900) 2 A debate on the resolution followed.

('53', 186, 0, 1, 363975) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 187
('53', 186, 1, 2, 364019) If you go on harping on the violence of Government and applauding the sacrifice and courage of our youths, I tell you you will only help to send many more of them to the gallows.
('53', 186, 1, 3, 364198) I do not so much mind Government hanging them as your driving them to the gallows, and I warn you that that is what you are actually doing by condemning violence 1 in one breath and applauding the courage behind it in the other.
('53', 186, 1, 4, 364427) Abhyankar warns me that our resolutions of condemnation have no effect on the youths.
('53', 186, 1, 5, 364513) He is mistaken.
('53', 186, 1, 6, 364529) Every word that we say here reaches their ears.
('53', 186, 1, 7, 364577) It sometimes angers them, but it often makes them think, and I humbly suggest that we can react on them only to the extent that we are in earnest.
('53', 186, 1, 8, 364724) Let us therefore tell them plainly and unequivocally that their action does not help us but hinders us.
('53', 186, 1, 9, 364828) I was responsible for suggesting the appointment of the Nariman Committee.
('53', 186, 1, 10, 364903) 2 It has got yet to complete some facts for me, but I cannot proceed even on the facts already collected, because the action of these young men greatly handicaps me.
('53', 186, 1, 11, 365069) Those who give them the slightest encouragement make it difficult to secure the liberty of those who are already suffering incarceration.
('53', 186, 1, 12, 365207) I could not get those political prisoners released under the Settlement, but I had hopes that I would do so by entreaty.
('53', 186, 1, 13, 365328) If you have elected to trust me, you must also trust my methods.
('53', 186, 1, 14, 365393) But if you dont, the honest course is to disown me and to change the creed.
('53', 186, 2, 15, 365469) The Bombay Chronicle, 7 8 1931, and Young India, 13 8 1931
('53', 186, 3, 16, 365528) 1 The source has non violence.
('53', 186, 3, 17, 365559) 2 It was appointed to collect from all the Provinces details regarding the political prisoners and others who were to be released under resolution No.

('53', 187, 2, 3, 365908) [On or after August 6, 1931] 1
('53', 187, 3, 4, 365939) NARANDAS, I am writing this while a meeting is proceeding.
('53', 187, 3, 5, 365998) You must have now recovered your composure.
('53', 187, 3, 6, 366042) I cannot even imagine your being agitated.
('53', 187, 3, 7, 366085) If you examine yourself to see why you were agitated, you will discover that there was no cause at all for your agitation.
('53', 187, 3, 8, 366208) Why should we be upset if someone entertains a groundless suspicion against us?
('53', 187, 3, 9, 366288) But I dont have to argue with you.
('53', 187, 3, 10, 366323) It is not as if you dont understand, but at present you have been disturbed in your heart and the effect on ones heart dies away only in the course of time through Ramanama.
('53', 187, 3, 11, 366497) Mahavir is being looked after with great care.
('53', 187, 3, 12, 366544) He feels very much better now.
('53', 187, 3, 13, 366575) The doctor says that he will have to remain under treatment for a few days.
('53', 187, 3, 14, 366651) His system is filled with poisonous germs.
('53', 187, 3, 15, 366694) Ba goes every day to inquire after him.
('53', 187, 3, 16, 366734) He is being looked after very carefully.
('53', 187, 3, 17, 366775) Tell Krishnamaiyadevi this.
('53', 187, 3, 18, 366803) I certainly wish to go there.
('53', 187, 3, 19, 366833) I may have to stay here up to the 9th.
('53', 187, 3, 20, 366872) It is still not certain whether I shall go to England.

('53', 187, 8, 26, 367096) DEAR MR. BHADRAPUR, With reference to the Panch fines in certain villages of Kheda, I send you herewith the original papers signed by those who had paid the fines.
('53', 187, 8, 27, 367260) You are the best judge of whether the papers contain the

('53', 188, 1, 3, 367683) I suggest too your personally seeing those who you may suspect of having been under any undue influence.

('53', 188, 6, 8, 367879) DEAR MR. BOLTON, I assure you that I am leaving no stone unturned to facilitate my decision.
('53', 188, 6, 9, 367972) My difficulty is this: I do not believe in the public opinion in England being vastly different from the opinion of the civilians here.
('53', 188, 6, 10, 368108) The things in Bardoli or U.P. may not be of much importance in themselves.
('53', 188, 6, 11, 368183) But they are portents and as such have a significance all their own.
('53', 188, 6, 12, 368252) I am waiting for a sign from Ganeshkhind 1. The misunderstanding about my reference to guest and host 2
('53', 188, 7, 13, 368356) has grieved me deeply.
('53', 188, 7, 14, 368379) What was meant to be a powerful argument for combating the mischief has been interpreted as a kind of encoura gement.
('53', 188, 7, 15, 368497) You have perhaps seen my article in Young India about what I expect to do in London if I reach there.

('53', 188, 10, 18, 368652) 198. SPEECH AT MEETING OF PARSIS, BOMBAY
('53', 188, 11, 19, 368693) August 7, 1931
('53', 188, 12, 20, 368708) Mahatma Gandhi .
('53', 188, 12, 21, 368725) said that he had not even a spare minute to deliver a lecture, because the time of delivering lectures had already gone.
('53', 188, 12, 22, 368846) Some time ago when he was released from jail 3, Mr. Bharucha took a promise from him to find time to address at least once to the Parsi community.
('53', 188, 12, 23, 368993) After that he came to Bombay many a
('53', 188, 13, 24, 369029) 1 The Governors summer residence, near Poona 2 In his article Foul Play, 30 7 1931 3 On January 26
('53', 189, 0, 1, 369128) 190 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 189, 1, 2, 369170) time, but somehow or other, Mr. Bharucha did not press him for the fulfilment of the promise.
('53', 189, 1, 3, 369264) Now, perhaps Mr. Bharucha thought that he would be going away to England, and, therefore, he was compelled to fulfil his promise that day.
('53', 189, 1, 4, 369403) Mahatma Gandhi then said that he had to go for his prayer at 7.30 and after prayer he would be busy till 11 p.m.
('53', 189, 1, 5, 369516) and, therefore, he had to be very brief in his speech.
('53', 189, 2, 6, 369571) Coming to his address, he said that there was no doubt that the Parsi community had done much for the country, but he thought that they had not come up to his expectation.
('53', 189, 2, 7, 369743) There were seven lakhs 1 of villages in India and if the Parsi community were to exercise their charity towards these poor starving millions, they should use the clothes made by these poor villagers.
('53', 189, 2, 8, 369943) Then the Parsi community should also try to spin for themselves.
('53', 189, 2, 9, 370008) There was a time in India when every household had a charkha; but they could not make any improvement in it while Lancashire continued to keep its pace with progress and made improvements in their spinning machinery with the result that Indian people who used hand spun cloth discontinued doing so and began to use the Lancashire fine cloth.
('53', 189, 2, 10, 370350) The Parsi community should remember that if they put on khadi, they would support millions of poor people.
('53', 189, 2, 11, 370457) Parsis were well known for their charity.
('53', 189, 2, 12, 370499) But which charity was better, the charity of service or the charity of giving money, asked Mahatmaji.
('53', 189, 2, 13, 370601) If the Parsis put on khadi they would demonstrate to the world two things.
('53', 189, 2, 14, 370676) Firstly, that they suffered for the sake of the poor and secondly, that they served the poor.
('53', 189, 2, 15, 370770) He thought, therefore, that suffering and service were better kind of charities than any other charity.
('53', 189, 3, 16, 370874) The other thing that he wanted to tell the Parsis was in regard to the liquor trade.
('53', 189, 3, 17, 370959) Many Parsis kept liquor shops which was the cause of the suffering of the poor.
('53', 189, 3, 18, 371039) He did not think that it was a very great thing for the Parsis to do away with the liquor traffic.
('53', 189, 3, 19, 371138) The Parsis came from Persia and had adapted themselves in such a way that they could very easily do away with the liquor shops and successfully prosper in any other business.
('53', 189, 3, 20, 371313) The charity which the Parsi community would do by doing away with the liquor trade would be immense to the country and when history is written of this country it would be stated of the Parsis that they made great sacrifices for the country.
('53', 189, 3, 21, 371554) In this regard Mithubehn had served Gujarat for which the Parsi community should be proud.
('53', 189, 3, 22, 371645) What Mithubehn had done for Gujarat every Parsi should do for his country.
('53', 189, 3, 23, 371720) It is for the Parsi community to create an atmosphere that the baneful liquor traffic might be done away with.
('53', 189, 3, 24, 371831) Some might ask what business then the Parsi liquor shopkeepers should get into.
('53', 189, 3, 25, 371911) Mahatma Gandhi said that the Parsi community was so much enterprising that they would be successful in any other business if they stopped the liquor traffic.
('53', 189, 3, 26, 372069) Take the case of Parsi Rustomji in South Africa, he said.
('53', 189, 3, 27, 372127) Rustomji had liquor business first which he closed down and got into other business and amassed great wealth and gave lakhs of rupees in charity.
('53', 189, 3, 28, 372273) He hoped, therefore, the Parsi community would seriously consider that point.

('53', 190, 1, 2, 372422) The third point was in regard to simplicity of life.
('53', 190, 1, 3, 372475) He did not know whether he would go to England or not.
('53', 190, 1, 4, 372530) People say he was going to England on the 15th, but he was not sure himself.
('53', 190, 1, 5, 372607) Whether he went to England or not he would say one thing to the Parsi community that they need not be afraid of their right and privileges.
('53', 190, 1, 6, 372747) The Parsi community was the smallest community in the whole of India, as it had hardly a population of a lakh.
('53', 190, 1, 7, 372858) They had no reason to fear for the future, because they had been backed up by their self reliance and strength.
('53', 190, 1, 8, 372970) The Parsi community has done no wrong to any other community in India and they should rest assured that no community would harm them.
('53', 190, 1, 9, 373104) But he would appeal to them to exercise simplicity of life.
('53', 190, 1, 10, 373164) The Parsis were accustomed to a standard of life, namely, they wanted costly furniture and other paraphernalia, which other communities did not have.
('53', 190, 1, 11, 373314) In future, they would have to try to exercise simplicity and self control.
('53', 190, 1, 12, 373389) When the National Congress demands that the highest official in India would be paid only Rs. 500, he felt assured that by that time the economic conditions in India would be so changed that everything would be had cheaply.
('53', 190, 1, 13, 373612) For instance, doctors charge one guinea for consultation and lawyers charge thousands of rupees for their fees.
('53', 190, 1, 14, 373724) That also would have to go to a minimum, and it was bound to go because everyone would have a simple life.

('53', 190, 3, 17, 373916) Gandhiji .
('53', 190, 3, 18, 373927) addressed a few remarks to those who sat round him on the dais.
('53', 190, 3, 19, 373991) He said that he was under the impression that he would discuss things with a few selected persons who were interested in the cause of swadeshi and who were invited to the Conference by the organizers.
('53', 190, 3, 20, 374192) But instead he found a large concourse of people.
('53', 190, 3, 21, 374242) He knew it was rather impossible to avoid such a crowd if they invited him to a place like the one where he had come.
('53', 190, 3, 22, 374360) He regretted that he could not say to them what he wanted to say on the subject.
('53', 190, 3, 23, 374441) He suggested that those who wanted to do the work should give their names and addresses to the organizers and become willing agents of swadeshi.
('53', 190, 3, 24, 374586) If the idea of establishing a contact with workers in the cause of swadeshi which the organizers had in view succeeded in Bombay then it could be copied at other places also.
('53', 190, 3, 25, 374761) Gandhiji added that the object was laudable, but again regretted that he could not express his views on the subject.
('53', 190, 4, 26, 374878) Some of those present asked Gandhiji a few questions to which he made replies and then left the place amidst shouts of Gandhijiki Jai and Inquilab Zindabad.

('53', 192, 7, 11, 376715) August 8, 1931
('53', 192, 8, 12, 376730) Mahatma Gandhi in reply made a very short speech.
('53', 192, 8, 13, 376780) He thanked the Parsi donor for his generous support to the eye hospital and was very glad to learn that Mr. Rata nsha, son of Mr. Merwanji, and other members of the family cherished the same feeling of goodwill towards this institution and said the institution deserved every kind of consideration and would not be wanting in help from the family members of Mr. Merwanji and the public.
('53', 192, 8, 14, 377167) He was pleased to find one more example of philanthropy in the Parsi community, which was known for its cosmopolitan charity.

('53', 192, 9, 16, 377325) 205. SPEECH AT A.I.C.C. MEETING, BOMBAY
('53', 192, 10, 17, 377365) August 8, 1931 I may tell you, that I am doing all that is humanly possible to enable me to go to London.
('53', 192, 10, 18, 377471) The Settlement commits the Congress to participate in the R.T.C. to place the Congress point of view before it.
('53', 192, 10, 19, 377583) But without the necessary atmosphere my going there would be futile.
('53', 192, 10, 20, 377652) I therefore declared that I could not go unless there was solution of the Hindu Muslim Sikh problem.
('53', 192, 10, 21, 377753) The Working Committee discussed my declaration, my reasoning did not appeal to it, and I had to bow to
('53', 192, 11, 22, 377856) 1 Before laying the corner stone of the new building of the Aimail Merwanji Chamarbagwala Free Ophthalmic Hospital.
('53', 193, 0, 1, 377972) 194 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 193, 1, 2, 378014) its decision that I must go even though a solution could not be attained before my going.
('53', 193, 1, 3, 378104) But that did not mean that I should go there as a mere Hindu.
('53', 193, 1, 4, 378166) If I went there as a mere Hindu, I should cease to be a representative of the Congress.
('53', 193, 1, 5, 378254) The Congress belongs to all communities, and the Working Committee decided that I had no reason to absent myself from the R.T.C. even though I might have to go there with less strength and less self confidence.
('53', 193, 1, 6, 378465) That meant a step forward in the direction of London.
('53', 193, 1, 7, 378519) But there were other difficulties, one of them being the implementing of the Truce by Government.
('53', 193, 1, 8, 378617) In this connection I made up my mind, that I must not make much of minor breaches of the Truce.
('53', 193, 1, 9, 378713) For instance there are still many in jail who should have been released under the Settlement, there are still prosecutions going on, and still arrests being made.
('53', 193, 1, 10, 378876) But as we, the workers, have voluntarily chosen the path of suffering, a few months imprisonment is of small account.
('53', 193, 1, 11, 378994) But it is quite a different matter where the peasants are concerned.
('53', 193, 1, 12, 379063) How can I ask them to put up with more suffering?
('53', 193, 1, 13, 379113) The Congress is essentially and pre eminently a kisan organization.
('53', 193, 1, 14, 379181) It also endeavours to represent the zamindars and the propertied classes, but only to the extent that the interests of the kisans are not prejudiced thereby.
('53', 193, 1, 15, 379339) The Congress is nothing if it does not represent the kisans.
('53', 193, 1, 16, 379400) And I was faced with the kisan problem in the U.P. and in Gujarat.
('53', 193, 1, 17, 379467) Mr. Emerson, the Home Secretary, helped to the extent that he could.
('53', 193, 1, 18, 379536) The Viceroy also assured me that I need not worry and that he would do everything needful.
('53', 193, 1, 19, 379627) Cordial as this assurance was, I wanted to see if there were any signs of the assurance being carried out.
('53', 193, 1, 20, 379734) I am still carrying on negotiations, and you may be sure that I shall not put too great a strain on those from whom I expect the assurance.
('53', 193, 1, 21, 379874) I am not conceited enough to feel that everything here would be at sixes and sevens in my absence.
('53', 193, 1, 22, 379973) But having been the sole Congress representative to carry on negotiations with Lord Irwin, and being so intimately connected with the kisans, I cannot leave for London if there is no relief or hope of it even for the existing state of things.
('53', 193, 1, 23, 380216) That is why I ran up to Poona as soon as I was summoned by the Governor of Bombay, 1 and now am waiting for a reply from him.
('53', 193, 1, 24, 380342) I sent him a telegram this morning, 2 and I am hourly expecting a reply.
('53', 193, 1, 25, 380415) I am waiting for a sign and as soon as I get it, I shall decide.

('53', 194, 0, 1, 380545) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 195
('53', 194, 1, 2, 380589) But do not be sure that I am sailing until I have actually boarded the ship.
('53', 194, 1, 3, 380666) For who knows what happens between today and the fifteenth?
('53', 194, 1, 4, 380726) Ours is a vast country, there are all sorts of rumours in the air and anything may lead to a conflagration.
('53', 194, 1, 5, 380834) You know what happened in the Jinnah Memorial Hall.
('53', 194, 1, 6, 380886) 1 Those are things that make me tremble, and may even unnerve me.
('53', 194, 1, 7, 380952) Would you send a nervous wreck to the Conference?
('53', 194, 1, 8, 381002) My decision would shock Lord Irwin who might well doubt whether I was in my senses, but even at the risk of annoying him I would prefer to stay here, if something that may happen between now and fifteenth shook me to the marrow.
('53', 194, 1, 9, 381231) I have the same love for the Mussalman as for the Hindu.
('53', 194, 1, 10, 381288) My heart feels for the Mussalman as much as for the Hindu.
('53', 194, 1, 11, 381347) If I could tear it open, you would discover that there are no compartments in it, one reserved for the Hindus, another for the Mussalmans and so on.
('53', 194, 1, 12, 381496) And therefore I hold myself responsible, when I find a Mussalman running at a Hindus throat and vice versa.
('53', 194, 1, 13, 381604) I have endured these things up to now, but there is a limit to human endurance.
('53', 194, 1, 14, 381684) I am laying bare my heart to you as a man pledged to truth.
('53', 194, 1, 15, 381744) I do not think any man can present a full record of what he feels, but I do know that I am keeping nothing from you.
('53', 194, 1, 16, 381861) I hear rumbling of the storm, and I want you not to be surprised if you find me quail before it.
('53', 194, 1, 17, 381958) That moment my strength may entirely fail me and render me completely impotent.
('53', 194, 1, 18, 382038) Having elected me your sole representative, I want you to accept me with all my limitations and weaknesses.
('53', 194, 1, 19, 382146) I have revealed to you my true self in all my weakness and impotence.
('53', 194, 1, 20, 382216) Maybe I may conquer that weakness; maybe a single Mussalman may be able to disabuse me of my fears and my impotence.
('53', 194, 2, 21, 382333) At this stage, he was so overwhelmed with emotion that he broke down, 2 and
('53', 194, 3, 22, 382409) could not proceed for a minute or two.
('53', 194, 3, 23, 382448) But he soon composed himself, and proceeded
('53', 194, 4, 24, 382492) to give in English a gist of what he had said in Hindi.
('53', 194, 4, 25, 382548) I did not really come here to pour out my feelings before you,
('53', 194, 5, 26, 382611) 1 On August 3, 1931 some Muslim hooligans had attacked prominent Nationalist Muslim leaders and Congressmen.
('53', 194, 5, 27, 382720) Fifteen persons were injured.
('53', 194, 5, 28, 382750) 2 Mahadev Desai, in his introduction to the report of this speech, gave the following information: When Sardar Vallabhbhai and Pandit Jawaharlal saw Gandhiji in the afternoon of the 8th and asked him whether he would be available for the evening sitting, as he was expected to make a statement on the question of his going to London, Gandhiji was reading an inflammatory leaflet issued by some of the rowdy agencies in Bombay.
('53', 194, 5, 29, 383177) It was so full of grossly false statements and deliberate incitement to violence that it made even Gandhijis blood boil.
('53', 194, 5, 30, 383298) In deep sorrow he
('53', 195, 0, 1, 383316) 196 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 195, 1, 2, 383358) but as I was proceeding, it was impossible for me to choke the rising emotions.
('53', 195, 1, 3, 383438) I have gone through a heart training which enables me to keep outwardly smiling while a storm may be raging in my breast.
('53', 195, 1, 4, 383560) That storm has reached a crisis and I am feeling unnerved and seem to have lost all power.
('53', 195, 1, 5, 383651) And therefore I say that, although the atmosphere may be clear so far as Government are concerned, I may not be able to go because there is a doubt lurking in my breast, that when the moment comes, it may find me unprepared.
('53', 195, 1, 6, 383876) Think of the disgraceful scenes in the Jinnah Memorial Hall the other day.
('53', 195, 1, 7, 383951) People who had done no wrong to anybody were pounced upon and belaboured without any provocation.
('53', 195, 1, 8, 384049) I saw a man who, if he chose to use his strength, would be a match for ten, profusely bleeding because of the brutal blows he had received that evening.
('53', 195, 1, 9, 384202) It was a pitiable sight for me.
('53', 195, 1, 10, 384234) Then I had a graphic account of the incident.
('53', 195, 1, 11, 384280) It shot into me like an arrow.
('53', 195, 1, 12, 384311) But that is not all.
('53', 195, 1, 13, 384332) I am studying and trying to understand what is lying concealed under the surface, and I must to a certain extent hold myself responsible for what is happening.
('53', 195, 1, 14, 384492) God used me as an instrument for creating that great awakening in the country in 1919. Naturally passions were aroused, but as all regarded themselves Indians fighting for a common cause, there was no internecine conflict.
('53', 195, 1, 15, 384715) But that was only a momentary dream soon to vanish like smoke, and now we find that we are all at war against one another.
('53', 195, 1, 16, 384838) That makes me unfit for the work for swaraj.
('53', 195, 1, 17, 384883) And so I say that, although the atmosphere may otherwise be clear, something might happen which might make me mad and absolutely powerless.
('53', 195, 1, 18, 385023) Surely you would not then want to send to London a man who was so unnerved.
('53', 195, 1, 19, 385099) You must send someone with faith, and I find myself fast losing faith.
('53', 195, 1, 20, 385170) That produced the collapse that you saw a moment ago.
('53', 195, 2, 21, 385224) Gandhiji added if Mr. Satyamurti 2 thought they were going to get their demands by argument, he was mistaken as most things at the Round Table Conference would be done behind the curtains and the whole thing would be stage managed.
('53', 195, 3, 22, 385456) said: I do not feel like going anywhere.
('53', 195, 3, 23, 385497) How I wish I could shut myself up here and cry out my grief.
('53', 195, 3, 24, 385558) There is so much violence in the air, so much falsehood, that I often wonder if it is worth while my going, even if other circumstances made it possible.
('53', 195, 3, 25, 385712) I am giving these details here in order that what appeared to be a sudden breakdown on that momentous evening may be presented in its true setting. 1 What follows is from The Hindu.
('53', 195, 3, 26, 385894) 2 Who had asked for an explanation from the Working Committee for its deci sion to send a sole delegate to the Round Table Conference contrary to the Karachi resolution.

('53', 196, 1, 2, 386108) Referring to Mr. Satyamurtis argument that various other interests were over represented and therefore the Congress should have adequate representation, Gandhiji said that that was the very reason why they had decided upon a sole representative Gandhiji added they could not settle such delicate questions by argument as days of argument had gone long ago, but things could be settled only by negotiations.
('53', 196, 1, 3, 386515) For such delicate negotiations, Gandhiji maintained, a single representative was much better suited than a delegation and asked Mr. Satyamurti to have faith in their representative, and added if he had no faith in the capacity of one representative, he could not have better faith in a delegation consisting of more than one.

('53', 196, 5, 9, 387104) These will be specially pledged to non violence, accepting non violence not as a policy but as a creed, not as a stray brick in the edifice of swaraj, but as the corner stone of which the removal would bring down the whole edifice.
('53', 196, 5, 10, 387336) I want them to be trustees of non violence, guarding it as a valuable treasure which may never be despoiled but ever increase.
('53', 196, 5, 11, 387463) As such their task will not be mere regulation of meetings, but to offer themselves up as sacrifices when there are disturbances such as we had in the Jinnah Memorial Hall.
('53', 196, 5, 12, 387636) Let the Seva Dal men be the salt of the Congress earth.
('53', 196, 5, 13, 387692) That army will be more powerful than any violent army.
('53', 196, 5, 14, 387747) The violent army cannot prevent the poison of untruth and communal strife from spreading, but you as a non violent army should be able to check it.
('53', 196, 5, 15, 387895) In a vigorous healthy independent India everyone must be ready to fight and die for the liberty and sacredness of the life of the individual.
('53', 196, 5, 16, 388037) I am not a pessimist.
('53', 196, 5, 17, 388059) I have abundant faith, that the time may come in my lifetime when this non violent army may be a fact and a living reality, and eclipse the record of brilliant soldiers.
('53', 196, 5, 18, 388229) It is not an idle dream, for whilst a violent army has its obvious limitations, a

('53', 197, 1, 2, 388502) non violent army has none of the same type.
('53', 197, 1, 3, 388546) Once it takes fire, it does not require any other training or discipline.
('53', 197, 1, 4, 388620) It should be the function of the Central Board to present an object lesson by the concentration on one spot which may be the headquarters of an ideal army.
('53', 197, 1, 5, 388776) If the movement catches fire in Karnatak, it will overrun the whole of India, but if it does not catch in Karnatak, it will produce mighty little effect in the province itself, much less in India.
('53', 197, 1, 6, 388973) If it becomes a live force, I should, if God wants me again to tour through Karnatak, see a different atmosphere there.
('53', 197, 1, 7, 389093) The whole province would then be a depot of non violent soldiers streaming out from day to day, just as every port town is a huge sailors quarters.
('53', 197, 1, 8, 389241) The Central Board has been deliberately intended to supply only officers.
('53', 197, 1, 9, 389315) There can be no provincial organization without an officer certified by the Seva Dal Office.
('53', 197, 1, 10, 389408) And if this your officer is a staunch man, if he has drunk in the tradition,you have through him moral control of the whole organization.
('53', 197, 1, 11, 389546) That is my ideal, and I am sure that it can be a living reality.
('53', 197, 1, 12, 389611) I have that amazing faith in Jawahar.
('53', 197, 1, 13, 389649) Fired with ample zeal he will do it.
('53', 197, 1, 14, 389686) There may be self deception in this belief of mine, but that self deception will help the country.
('53', 197, 1, 15, 389785) As for Dr. Hardikar, I have not come in close touch with him, but I have hope and faith in him because I have faith in the destiny of India.
('53', 197, 1, 16, 389926) That faith would be shattered if non violence does not become a live force.
('53', 197, 1, 17, 390002) Today there is blind following on the part of the masses, and the classes follow with the almost stupid calculation of a Bania.
('53', 197, 1, 18, 390130) Attempt has been made to wean the Congressmen of this stupid calculation, but it can succeed only if the Congress volunteers will be true to their salt.
('53', 197, 1, 19, 390283) Once non violence has found a lodgement in their hearts there is no limit to its expansion.
('53', 197, 1, 20, 390375) The awakening that we witnessed last year would have been impossible without this.
('53', 197, 1, 21, 390458) Read history with my eyes.
('53', 197, 1, 22, 390485) Take the history of the Mutiny.
('53', 197, 1, 23, 390517) It was a war of independence fought with violent weapons.
('53', 197, 1, 24, 390575) Malleson has narrated a fairly faithful account.
('53', 197, 1, 25, 390624) You will see that though the greased cartridges may have been an immediate cause, it was just a spark in a magazine that was ready.
('53', 197, 1, 26, 390756) But look at the result.
('53', 197, 1, 27, 390780) The U.P., the storm centre of 1857, has for generations since remained under a paralysis as perhaps no other province.
('53', 197, 1, 28, 390899) For people have retained vivid memories of man turned beast, and masses who simply watched were mown down like corn stalks in a field.
('53', 197, 1, 29, 391034) Take now this 12 years experiment.
('53', 197, 1, 30, 391069) It is a short time in the history of the nation.
('53', 197, 1, 31, 391118) The experiment and its mighty results would have been impossible without the great force of non violence.

('53', 198, 1, 4, 391426) I know to what heights it can rise.
('53', 198, 1, 5, 391462) It has given us not only a Rabindranath Tagore, but a whole army of great men.
('53', 198, 1, 6, 391541) But it is paralysed today, unable to come up to its natural height.
('53', 198, 1, 7, 391609) I say this in spite of its brilliant record of the past year.
('53', 198, 1, 8, 391671) But for the spirit of violence that has overtaken it, the record would have been still more brilliant.
('53', 198, 1, 9, 391774) I have drawn a distinction between a violent and a non violent army.
('53', 198, 1, 10, 391843) There will be difference in the nature of discipline.
('53', 198, 1, 11, 391897) The Tommy yields obedience whilst at war, but will yield to wild licence when free from it.
('53', 198, 1, 12, 391989) But a non violent soldier carries discipline in his heart and will carry an atmosphere of restraint in every walk of life.
('53', 198, 1, 13, 392112) Non violence is a trust which has to be zealously guarded by the Seva Dal.
('53', 198, 1, 14, 392187) Your soldiers will not only keep discipline in meetings but in homes and domestic affairs.
('53', 198, 1, 15, 392278) A non violent soldier is non violent in all places and at all times.

('53', 198, 4, 19, 392413) It is a matter of regret that a small demand made by this national university four months ago has yet not been fully met.
('53', 198, 4, 20, 392535) As Ahmedabad has been naturally deriving the greatest benefit from it, Kakasahebs expectations of Ahmedabad in this matter should not be considered too high.
('53', 198, 4, 21, 392693) It is not beyond the capacity of the city to raise and donate that amount.
('53', 198, 4, 22, 392768) There can be no two opinions about the fitness of the Vidyapith or its usefulness.
('53', 198, 4, 23, 392851) It should also not be necessary for Kakasahebs teachers to go begging from house to house.
('53', 198, 4, 24, 392942) What is required is willingness on the part of the rich or the middle class or both in Ahmedabad to collect Rs. 25,000. If one or two citizens take the matter in their hands, they can raise the sum in a week or a fortnight.
('53', 198, 4, 25, 393166) May I hope that Ahmedabad will do this?
('53', 198, 4, 26, 393206) Those who can afford to pay only small sums through Navajivan, may do so at its office or send the money directly to Kakasaheb.

('53', 199, 6, 9, 393841) August 9, 1931
('53', 199, 7, 10, 393856) At a special session of the Hindustani Seva Dal Conference held.
('53', 199, 7, 11, 393921) in the Jinnah Hall a resolution was adopted confirming the decision of the Central Board of Volunteers to dissolve all the organizations of the Dal and handing it over to the Working Committee of the Congress.
('53', 199, 8, 12, 394131) Mahatma Gandhi opened the Conference and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the Congress President, presided.
('53', 199, 9, 13, 394232) Mahatma Gandhi .
('53', 199, 9, 14, 394249) said that the Conference was meant not to write the epitaph of the Seva Dal as Mrs. Naidu who was asked to preside but could not do so owing to her departure to Hyderabad had said in her letter.
('53', 199, 9, 15, 394444) On the contrary, it was meant to make the Seva Dal stronger.
('53', 199, 9, 16, 394505) The Congress now wanted to bring the Dal under its direct control because it felt that the time had come when it should organize all the volunteers in the country and bring them under its own control.
('53', 199, 9, 17, 394706) Proceeding, he said: The fight we carried on last year impressed upon me the need for training and discipline among the volunteers.
('53', 199, 9, 18, 394838) The volunteers that we got as the struggle proceeded had not the required training.
('53', 199, 9, 19, 394922) Although we gained much by that struggle we also suffered I certain

('53', 199, 10, 21, 395134) The addressee was a fallen woman who wanted to lead an honourable life.

('53', 200, 1, 2, 395250) respects.
('53', 200, 1, 3, 395260) You might not be knowing it.
('53', 200, 1, 4, 395289) But I know it better.
('53', 200, 1, 5, 395311) Although I was behind the bars of Yeravda I was getting newspapers and I could see what was going on in the country from day to day.
('53', 200, 1, 6, 395444) It is but natural, when there is mass awakening.
('53', 200, 1, 7, 395493) But if there is no discipline many evils are sure to creep in.
('53', 200, 1, 8, 395556) It did happen like that in the last struggle.
('53', 200, 1, 9, 395602) The volunteer organizations are in fact the very soul of the Congress.
('53', 200, 1, 10, 395673) The very existence of the Congress depends on them, because they are the army of the Congress.
('53', 200, 1, 11, 395768) Of course our army is to be non violent.
('53', 200, 1, 12, 395809) We have adopted a new way.
('53', 200, 1, 13, 395836) Our army is not to bear arms.
('53', 200, 1, 14, 395866) Nor have we to make use of ammunitions.
('53', 200, 1, 15, 395906) The Congress has decided to save India by that new weapon.
('53', 200, 1, 16, 395965) We have already achieved considerable success by following that way.
('53', 200, 1, 17, 396034) And we mean to achieve more.
('53', 200, 1, 18, 396063) But our success depends on our non violent army of volunteers.
('53', 200, 1, 19, 396126) If they do not save India, if instead of saving they themselves destroy it, if instead of being the apostles of non violence they themselves become the votaries of violence, how can we expect to succeed in our struggle?
('53', 200, 1, 20, 396346) Although I was behind the bars of Yeravda I was getting newspapers regularly and I could see what was going on.
('53', 200, 1, 21, 396458) I felt that if we want to use the Seva Dal for our purpose we must effect certain changes and make it more useful for our work.
('53', 200, 1, 22, 396586) It is to bring about that change that we have met here.
('53', 200, 1, 23, 396642) That is the object of this Conference.
('53', 200, 1, 24, 396681) Those who have been serving the Seva Dal or helping it in other ways need not be sorry for this change because this change is for thegood of the Seva Dal.
('53', 200, 1, 25, 396836) It is for the good of the country.
('53', 200, 1, 26, 396871) It is to conserve all that was good in the Seva Dal and to put new life into it.
('53', 200, 1, 27, 396952) We expect that the changes will strengthen the Dal and make it more useful for the service of the country.
('53', 200, 1, 28, 397059) The Working Committee had decided to entrust the work to Dr. Hardikar and Pandit Jawaharlal.
('53', 200, 1, 29, 397152) The Committee expects very good results from this new arrangement.
('53', 200, 1, 30, 397219) We require the services of the Seva Dal in every case.
('53', 200, 1, 31, 397274) At present we are living in peace time.
('53', 200, 1, 32, 397314) Whether the Truce is followed by a permanent peace or whether we have to start the struggle again we require the services of the Dal.
('53', 200, 1, 33, 397448) As I said it is our army and we have to maintain it.
('53', 200, 1, 34, 397501) I must admit that so far I did not take any great interest in the work of the Seva Dal although I consider myself always a good soldier and am keenly interested in such

('53', 201, 1, 4, 397792) I wish it is so.

('53', 201, 3, 8, 397941) August 10, 1931
('53', 201, 4, 9, 397957) Q. 1. Will you be ready to give shelter in the Ashram to the three women or to any of them who may wish to join it?
('53', 201, 5, 10, 398073) A. Yes, I shall be very happy to do so.
('53', 201, 5, 11, 398113) But before joining the Ashram, the women should know and understand my views fully.
('53', 201, 6, 12, 398197) Q. 2. What are those views?
('53', 201, 7, 13, 398225) A. My first duty will be to inform the Government as soon as the women arrive and communicate their names and other particulars.
('53', 201, 8, 14, 398354) Q. 3. If you inform the Government, it will immediately arrest them and prosecute them.
('53', 201, 9, 15, 398442) A. Yes, that is possible.
('53', 201, 9, 16, 398468) The women should be ready for this risk when joining the Ashram.
('53', 201, 10, 17, 398533) Q. 4 What, then, will be the advantage to the women of joining the ashram?
('53', 201, 11, 18, 398608) A. It is also possible that, in response to my request, the Government may not prosecute them just now or as long as they live in the Ashram and try to live henceforth in accordance with the Ashram ideals of life.
('53', 201, 12, 19, 398822) Q. 5. Will not the Government try to obtain from them information about all that they have done?
('53', 201, 13, 20, 398919) A. It will certainly want to obtain such information, but I will tell it, and tell the women, too, that they should confess only their own crimes and errors without involving any other person.
('53', 201, 14, 21, 399112) Q. 6. In sum, you desire that the women should join the Ashram ready to face all risks.
('53', 201, 15, 22, 399200) A. Yes, I should like them to join the Ashram ready to face all

('53', 204, 13, 19, 403089) NARANDAS, I got your letter.
('53', 204, 13, 20, 403118) I see from it that my public reference to the matter has hurt both .
('53', 204, 13, 21, 403187) 1 and you and also that you think that what I said was improper.
('53', 204, 13, 22, 403252) I realized only today that you felt or might feel hurt.
('53', 204, 13, 23, 403308) I had not connected your agitation with my statement.
('53', 204, 13, 24, 403362) I had believed that you must have been agitated by the very thought that someone had entertained even a suspicion against you.

('53', 205, 1, 4, 403642) She had in fact laughed away the whole thing and that had reassured me.
('53', 205, 1, 5, 403714) If I referred to the matter in public, it was, as is my wont, with the intention of clearing the air.
('53', 205, 1, 6, 403816) Since people had started talking about it, I thought it advisable to express my view so that the whispering might stop.
('53', 205, 1, 7, 403936) I see nothing improper in this.
('53', 205, 1, 8, 403968) At any rate there is no cause in it at all for anyone to feel hurt.
('53', 205, 1, 9, 404036) How amusing it is that we remain unconcerned if anyone talks about us in private but feel hurt if somebody mentions the same thing in public.
('53', 205, 1, 10, 404178) Moreover, why should we feel hurt by any suspicion for which there is no ground at all?
('53', 205, 1, 11, 404266) Think over all this.

('53', 206, 4, 8, 405588) 218. NEED FOR FEELING HELPLESS
('53', 206, 5, 9, 405619) God is great, and we are but dust.
('53', 206, 5, 10, 405654) But thanks to our pride, whilst we say with our lips God is great, our actions belie the profession and show that we think nothing of God and a mighty lot of ourselves.
('53', 206, 5, 11, 405823) But it is time to realize our helplessness.
('53', 206, 5, 12, 405867) The growing goondaism of which Bombay had a bitter experience must furnish all with food for reflection.
('53', 206, 5, 13, 405972) It cannot, it must not be answered with counter goondaism than which nothing is easier.
('53', 206, 5, 14, 406060) What can be easier than to swear harder than ones opponent or to give two blows against one or to organize ten men against five?
('53', 206, 5, 15, 406189) But this can serve no earthly purpose.
('53', 206, 5, 16, 406228) And if it can serve any celestial purpose, that abode must be worse than the fabled hell.
('53', 206, 5, 17, 406318) Is there then no remedy for the growing evil?
('53', 206, 5, 18, 406364) The time honoured and well tried method is that of prayer and fasting.
('53', 206, 5, 19, 406435) But both have to come from the heart.
('53', 206, 5, 20, 406473) A parrot like repetition of the choicest sentiment and mere starvation of the body would be worse than useless.
('53', 206, 5, 21, 406585) Prayer and fasting avail where there is a definite consciousness of the presence of God in us, even as we have of friends living under the same roof.
('53', 206, 5, 22, 406735) Self deception will not do.
('53', 206, 5, 23, 406763) Jawaharlal uttered the feeling of co workers, when in anguish he said, This will stop political life and may even influence social life. The way out is not to give any handle to goondaism.
('53', 206, 5, 24, 406952) The best way would be for peaceful men to withdraw from meetings when the goondas have invaded it.
('53', 206, 5, 25, 407051) Truth will not be suppressed by violence.
('53', 206, 5, 26, 407093) And if those who represent it will suffer without retaliation, they will find that it will spread without effort.
('53', 206, 5, 27, 407207) Difficulty however lies in
('53', 206, 6, 28, 407234) 1 At this time Chhaganlal Joshi was working around Navsari.
('53', 207, 0, 1, 407294) 208 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 207, 1, 2, 407336) knowing where truth lies.
('53', 207, 1, 3, 407362) It is easy enough to accuse ones opponent of representing untruth.
('53', 207, 1, 4, 407429) But this inherent inability to demonstrate the absolute truthfulness of ones position makes toleration an imperative necessity for the progress of ordered life.
('53', 207, 1, 5, 407590) Without the freedom to everyone to express his opinion unfettered by interference from those who hold the contrary, ordered life becomes an impossibility.
('53', 207, 1, 6, 407745) Is refusal even to defend oneself the logical outcome of this argument?
('53', 207, 1, 7, 407817) For the moment I do not need to go so far, though for those who believe in non violence through and through, self defence is an impossibility.
('53', 207, 1, 8, 407960) For them not to defend is the best self defence.
('53', 207, 1, 9, 408009) This however is not an artificial or mechanical state that can be imposed from without.
('53', 207, 1, 10, 408097) It does not admit of being argued out.
('53', 207, 1, 11, 408136) One has to grow to it.
('53', 207, 1, 12, 408159) The need of the moment is to realize our helplessness.
('53', 207, 1, 13, 408214) A Tamil proverb truly has it: God is the Help of the helpless.
('53', 207, 1, 14, 408277) This realization will show us a way out of the present impenetrable darkness, without our having to work out the logical outcome of non violence.
('53', 207, 1, 15, 408423) This is the work of philosophers.
('53', 207, 1, 16, 408457) For us helpless men and women who have to serve from day to day and often in the face of gloomy despair, it is enough if we can sing with the Seer: One step enough for me.

('53', 207, 6, 22, 408946) I am unable to accept these reasons as valid and I cannot but feel that your misgivings arise from a misunderstanding of policy of Government and grounds on which it rests.
('53', 207, 6, 23, 409119) In particular I should have thought any misgivings as regards the United Provinces would have been removed by Sir Malcolm Haileys telegram to you of 6th August, and as regards Gujarat by paragraph four of the letter of the Private Secretary to Sir Ernest Hotson to you of August 10th.
('53', 207, 6, 24, 409404) I would remind you of my personal letter to you of July 31st in which I gave you the fullest assurances of my personal interest in everything to do with the Settlement and could therefore have hoped that you would not allow disputes over present details to prevent your serving India by participating in the momentous discussion of the future constitution which may determine the destiny of the country beyond your time or

('53', 208, 14, 17, 410382) August 13, 1931 After the announcement of the decision of the Congress Working Committee, Mahatma Gandhi spoke to a group of Press representatives.
('53', 208, 14, 18, 410530) Mahatmaji said: It is needless to say I am very unhappy that I shall not go to London.
('53', 208, 14, 19, 410617) I know what effect this will have on Lord Irwin, and I also know how disappointed my numerous friends in England will be.
('53', 208, 14, 20, 410739) But this decision against my going there was inevitable.
('53', 208, 14, 21, 410796) I was hoping against hope and expected to the last moment that justice would be done.
('53', 208, 14, 22, 410882) I think I made a very modest request.
('53', 208, 14, 23, 410920) If, there was a Settlement between the Government and the Congress, and if there is a dispute in the interpretation of this Settlement or if either of the parties contravenes the terms of the Settlement, then the same rules that are followed regarding other pacts should be applied to this Settlement too.
('53', 208, 14, 24, 411226) This, in my opinion, is all the more necessary because the present Settlement is between a powerful Government and a mighty Congress, claiming to represent the entire nation.
('53', 208, 14, 25, 411401) The observance of the terms of the present Settlement cannot be enforced by law.
('53', 208, 14, 26, 411482) The Government is
('53', 208, 15, 27, 411500) If however your telegram represents the final word I will at once inform the Prime Minister of your inability to attend the Conference. 1 In reply the Viceroy wired on August 14: I have informed the Prime Minister of your decision.
('53', 208, 15, 28, 411732) I am releasing relevant correspondence to the Press.
('53', 208, 15, 29, 411785) You are of course free to do the same.
('53', 209, 0, 1, 411824) 210 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 209, 1, 2, 411866) therefore doubly bound to place before an impartial tribunal all these points of dispute between itself and the Congress.
('53', 209, 1, 3, 411988) The Government however refused to accept this very modest proposal of the Congress.
('53', 209, 1, 4, 412072) Under these circumstances it would have been very wrong for the Congress to join the Round Table Conference.
('53', 209, 1, 5, 412181) I cannot say anything more than this at this time.
('53', 209, 1, 6, 412232) I hope it would be possible for the Working Committee to publish the relevant correspondence as and when necessary.
('53', 209, 1, 7, 412348) The public will, then, be able to form its own opinion.
('53', 209, 2, 8, 412404) After this, a Press representative asked Mahatma Gandhi: What is your programme for the future? Mahatmaji replied: At this moment I am unable to say off hand what the future programme will be.
('53', 209, 2, 9, 412597) It will depend on the steps which the Government will take.
('53', 209, 3, 10, 412657) Q. Will civil disobedience movement be launched and if so when?
('53', 209, 4, 11, 412721) A. As far as I know, there is no idea of starting the satyagraha struggle immediately.
('53', 209, 5, 12, 412808) Q. When will you leave Bombay and what is your destination ?
('53', 209, 6, 13, 412869) A. I intend to leave Bombay tomorrow evening for Ahmedabad.
('53', 209, 7, 14, 412929) Q. Is there any hope of resumption of talks between yourself and the Viceroy about the Settlement?
('53', 209, 8, 15, 413028) A. If you are referring to resumption of talks on the question of representation of the Congress at the Round Table Conference, as far as I know, and as far as the Congress Working Committee is concerned, there is no question of resumption of the talks.
('53', 209, 9, 16, 413282) After this the representative asked whether the Delhi Settlement endured or was abrogated.
('53', 209, 9, 17, 413373) Mahatmaji replied: The breakdown of the present talks does not necessarily mean annulment of the Delhi Pact.
('53', 209, 9, 18, 413482) Refusal to send a representative to the Round Table Conference for breach of the Settlement is one thing; and abrogation of the Settlement itself is another thing.
('53', 209, 9, 19, 413646) I can say this much, namely, Congress is not prepared to do anything drastic in the near future.
('53', 209, 9, 20, 413743) Congress will endeavour its utmost to fulfil the terms of the Settlement.
('53', 209, 9, 21, 413817) But the Government can create intolerable conditions.

('53', 211, 26, 31, 416815) August 14, 1931 Events have moved so fast that I have not had the time to acknowledge your very kind personal letter 2 of 31st July.
('53', 211, 26, 32, 416948) I recognize the sincerity running through that communication but the latest developments have made that letter past history, and as I have said in my wire of 13th inst., the sum total of all the circumstances betrays a fundamental difference of outlook between us.
('53', 211, 26, 33, 417213) I can only give you my assurance that it was not without the greatest and most anxious deliberation that I came to the conclusion that in view of your decision I could not, consistently with my obligations here, attend the

('53', 212, 1, 2, 417585) Round Table Conference.
('53', 212, 1, 3, 417609) But I was grieved when I heard that your decision was affected by the opinion ascribed to you that I had insisted upon a board of arbitration and that I was trying to set myself up as a head of parallel government.
('53', 212, 1, 4, 417824) As for the board of arbitration it is true that I have claimed it as a matter of right but if you recall our conversation I never insisted upon it.
('53', 212, 1, 5, 417972) On the contrary, I told you that so long as I got the justice to which I was entitled I would be quite satisfied.
('53', 212, 1, 6, 418086) You will agree that this is wholly different from insisting on a board of arbitration.
('53', 212, 1, 7, 418173) As to the alleged parallel government, I thought I had dispelled the illusion when, in reply to a jocular remark by you, I had told you that I did not claim to be a district officer but that my co workers and I had acted as voluntary Patels or village Headmen and that too with the consent and knowledge of district officials.
('53', 212, 1, 8, 418500) I should therefore be sorry if these two opinions which I submit were erroneous had affected your decision.
('53', 212, 1, 9, 418608) The purpose however of writing this letter is to inquire whether you regard the Settlement as now at an end or whether it is to be still continued.
('53', 212, 1, 10, 418756) in spite of the abstention of the Congress from partici pation in the Round Table Conference.
('53', 212, 1, 11, 418850) The Working Committee arrived at the following decision this morning:
('53', 212, 2, 12, 418920) In view of the resolution relating to the Congress non participation in the Round Table Conference passed by the Working Committee on August 13, the Committee desires to make it clear that this resolution should not be construed as ending the Delhi Settlement.
('53', 212, 2, 13, 419181) The Committee therefore advises Congress organizations and all Congressmen to continue to comply, until further instructions, with the terms of the Settlement in so far as they are applicable to the Congress.
('53', 212, 2, 14, 419390) From this you will observe that the Working Committee of the Congress has no desire to embarrass the Government at the present juncture and that therefore it is prepared to continue honourably to work the Settlement.
('53', 212, 2, 15, 419607) But such working must depend upon a reciprocal attitude on the part of Provincial governments.
('53', 212, 2, 16, 419702) As I have told you so often through correspondence and our conversations, this reciprocity has been found to be progressively missing.
('53', 212, 2, 17, 419837) Information continues to be received at the office of the Working Committee of Government activity which can only be interpreted to be token of a design to crush the Congress workers and the normal Congress activities.
('53', 212, 2, 18, 420056) If therefore the Settlement is to abide I venture to think that an early relief in the matter of complaints already filed is necessary.
('53', 212, 2, 19, 420192) More, as I have already said, are coming and co workers are insistent that if relief is

('53', 213, 3, 6, 420488) August 14, 1931
('53', 213, 4, 7, 420504) Q. If negotiations are not reopened, will you withhold renewal of the civil disobedience movement until the second Round Table Conference finishes its labour?
('53', 213, 5, 8, 420663) A. It is difficult to give a conclusive answer, but the Congress will make every effort not to renew the civil disobedience movement.
('53', 213, 5, 9, 420797) Much will depend upon the attitude of Government.
('53', 213, 6, 10, 420847) Q. If the second R.T.C. fails to grant your principal demands or substance thereof will you consider the Delhi Pact a dead letter, and will you then renew the struggle?
('53', 213, 7, 11, 421016) A. The renewal of the struggle is a certainty if the Congress demands are not granted.
('53', 213, 8, 12, 421103) Q. If the struggle is resumed, will it be more intensive and upon a wider scale ?
('53', 213, 9, 13, 421185) A. I should hope so.
('53', 213, 9, 14, 421206) Certainly no stone will be left unturned to make the struggle more intensive and extensive.
('53', 213, 10, 15, 421298) Q. In making your decision yesterday, did you pray for divine guidance ?
('53', 213, 11, 16, 421371) A. In all my recent activities and decision 1 yesterday of the Working Committee, the hand of God can be distinctly traced.
('53', 213, 11, 17, 421495) I can assure you that throughout these anxious days, I have searched my heart eagerly for divine guidance.
('53', 213, 12, 18, 421602) Q. If Lord Irwin had been Viceroy, do you think you would have come to terms with him about going to London?
('53', 213, 13, 19, 421711) A. Comparisons are invidious.
('53', 213, 14, 20, 421741) Q. Do you attribute responsibility for the failure of the negotiations to the Provincial authorities, to Earl Willingdon, to the London Government, or to all three?
('53', 213, 15, 21, 421906) A. I attribute responsibility for the failure to the obstinacy of the Provincial authorities, but still more to the force of circum stances.
('53', 213, 16, 22, 422047) Q. Do you believe the Working Committees resolution of yesterday leaves the way clear for Government to reopen negotiations, leading to your presence in

('53', 214, 1, 2, 422271) London?
('53', 214, 2, 3, 422279) A. The Working Committees resolution undoubtedly leaves the door open for all kinds of negotiations, so long as they are designed to lead the Congress to its destined goal.
('53', 214, 3, 4, 422452) Q. What in brief are you minimum terms for you going to London?
('53', 214, 4, 5, 422516) A. Satisfactory assurances that the conditions of the Delhi Settlement will be observed by the Provincial governments so far as they are applicable to them.
('53', 214, 4, 6, 422673) Satisfaction must be to the party claiming to be injured, which in this case is the Congress.
('53', 214, 5, 7, 422767) Q. Was failure to settle the Hindu Muslim communal problem or any other
('53', 214, 6, 8, 422839) recent development a contributing factor to your decision not to go to London?
('53', 214, 7, 9, 422918) A. No other happening contributed to my decision except the breakdown of the Delhi Settlement at a most critical period, when, if the Provincial governments had really intended that I should go to London, they would and should have made my way clear.
('53', 214, 8, 10, 423169) Q. Do you think there is any danger of the peasants spontaneously suspending the payment of land revenue when they see that you are not going to London?
('53', 214, 9, 11, 423322) A. I hope not, and certainly not if we have acquired any control over them.

('53', 215, 3, 7, 424113) I was looking forward to making the acquaintance of the neighbours of Kingsley Hall and come in intimate contact with their lives.
('53', 215, 3, 8, 424244) But God has willed otherwise.
('53', 215, 3, 9, 424274) I hardly think you need my assurance that I have neither been wilful nor obstinate.

('53', 215, 3, 12, 424451) Whilst therefore I have been grieved to arrive at the decision not to go, deep down I have the feeling that it was the best thing and that the time was not ripe for me to go to London.

('53', 217, 7, 12, 427567) You are going through a terrible trial.
('53', 217, 7, 13, 427607) But I know that in the midst of it all you can remain cheerful and unruffled.
('53', 217, 7, 14, 427685) I would not think of tearing you away from Papa.

('53', 219, 6, 10, 429402) 234. DIVINE WILL
('53', 219, 7, 11, 429419) All had thought it certain that I would have left on the 15th for England.
('53', 219, 7, 12, 429494) Many persons here, in England and in other parts of the world were eager that I should go.
('53', 219, 7, 13, 429585) However, if a person like Ramachandra had no foreknowledge that at the hour fixed for his coronation he would have to leave for the forest, how can a common man like me or an ordinary organization like the Indian National Congress say with certainty that a certain thing will happen at a certain time?
('53', 219, 7, 14, 429887) Gods will prevails in all matters, and it is always for the best.
('53', 219, 7, 15, 429953) I see nothing but Gods will in the Viceroys reply.
('53', 219, 7, 16, 430004) I can certainly state that I sincerely did all that a human being could do to enable me to go to England and take part in the Round Table Conference.
('53', 219, 7, 17, 430154) If, in spite of this I have not been able to go, I am sure that Indias good lies in my not going.
('53', 219, 7, 18, 430252) For myself I see no difference between the officials here and the political leaders in England.
('53', 219, 7, 19, 430348) If we have to struggle hard to secure justice from these officials even in the most trivial matters, and if sometimes we fail to get it despite all our efforts, it is an idle hope that we shall get justice in England in much more important matters.
('53', 219, 7, 20, 430597) The logic of this is quite simple.
('53', 219, 7, 21, 430632) A big sum in arithmetic is the total of small sums.
('53', 219, 7, 22, 430684) What is true of the smallest is true of the biggest.
('53', 219, 7, 23, 430737) If, therefore, it is impossible to secure justice in very small matters, it will also be impossible to get it in a big matter.
('53', 219, 7, 24, 430864) According to this logic, what has happened here is only a warning of what is going to happen in England.
('53', 219, 7, 25, 430969) If this line of reasoning is correct it was best, even from a

('53', 220, 1, 4, 431555) I shall now have to ask the nation to work harder and I hope that it will respond.

('53', 221, 9, 14, 433567) Now that I am not going to London I would like you to give me a weekly budget of news.
('53', 221, 9, 15, 433654) I am trying to send someone for khadi work and I am also thinking of sending one or two more sisters.
('53', 221, 9, 16, 433756) Of course I shall send no one without first getting your approval.
('53', 221, 9, 17, 433823) Hamida I have not forgotten at all and the other I have in mind is Kusumbehn whom you know so well and who was with us during the Almora tour.

('53', 223, 1, 3, 435964) If the information given by the Sardar was correct, I am sorry.
('53', 223, 1, 4, 436028) I do believe that the resolution should have been rescinded for the sake of the young men and for the sake of truth.
('53', 223, 1, 5, 436145) But I suppose you were utterly helpless.
('53', 223, 1, 6, 436186) As for the party disputes in Bengal, after the receipt of Subhass letter, I had an informal discussion with as many members as I could get hold of at the time and we all came to the conclusion that, in the circumstances, it would be better to let things take their own course and let Mr. Aney give his finding.

('53', 224, 9, 13, 438109) MY DEAR SUBBIAH, I have your letter.
('53', 224, 9, 14, 438146) Your telegram was attended to as soon as it was received.
('53', 224, 9, 15, 438204) Now that I am not going to London I expect to be relieved of some pressure.
('53', 224, 9, 16, 438280) But it is also likely that the pressure may increase.
('53', 224, 9, 17, 438334) Lalita 1 has no excuse for not completing her Hindi.
('53', 224, 9, 18, 438387) She cant plead want of time nor want of tuition.
('53', 224, 9, 19, 438436) You can give it to her for a few minutes daily, but what she needs is not so much tuition as application.
('53', 224, 9, 20, 438542) I cannot help the feeling that if those from the South who are nearest me will not take the trouble of learning Hindi, there is something wrong, and then I have no right to expect the others to learn it.
('53', 224, 9, 21, 438746) Either a knowledge of Hindi is a necessity for the service of the masses and therefore should be at once learnt by all true servants or it is not necessary, in which case the Hindi Prachar Office should be

('53', 225, 10, 21, 440017) 2 Of August 16. Nariman had said that he had met Cowasji Jehangir after the latters return from Poona, and that the position as he could understand from him as well as from the telegram sent by Sapru and Jayakar to the Viceroy was that Gandhiji would be prepared to go to London on the Government agreeing to appoint an impartial officer to enquire into the forcible revenue collection in Bardoli.
('53', 225, 10, 22, 440415) He had asked if this was correct.

('53', 227, 11, 20, 442363) Believe me there is nothing spectacular in the loin cloth.
('53', 227, 11, 21, 442422) It is a vital necessity.
('53', 227, 11, 22, 442447) Was there anything spectacular in the change made in S. Africa?
('53', 227, 11, 23, 442511) Is the dress, i.e., the loin cloth of the coolie in Natal spectacular?
('53', 227, 11, 24, 442582) And how if I do not feel anything better than he?
('53', 227, 11, 25, 442632) Do you know that millions in India do not wear anything more than a loin cloth?
('53', 227, 11, 26, 442712) But I forget you are a superior woman.
('53', 227, 11, 27, 442751) You cannot judge people by the ordinary standard.
('53', 227, 11, 28, 442801) My book is true, because it is a faithful reproduction of my recollections.

('53', 228, 1, 4, 443145) But send me a list of all inaccuracies and omissions.
('53', 228, 1, 5, 443199) And endeavour will be made to make the necessary corrections and additions when the second edition is called for.
('53', 228, 1, 6, 443313) My right hand is out of use.

It does not any longer affect me but I may say that the appeal is not likely to be of much use because in my opinion the Government want to keep the question for themselves to arbitrate upon.

('53', 233, 2, 3, 448197) AHMEDABAD, August 18, 1931
('53', 233, 3, 4, 448224) Interviewed .
('53', 233, 3, 5, 448238) in connection with the latest statement made by Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya 1 Mahatma Gandhi said: I have read Pandit Malaviyas message.
('53', 233, 3, 6, 448375) Whilst what he says about the immediate demand is substantially true, I am unable to share his opitimism.
('53', 233, 3, 7, 448481) It is perfectly correct for Pandit Malaviya to say that the issue has been narrowed down to one single matter.
('53', 233, 3, 8, 448592) It is so narrowed only for the purpose of enabling me to sail for England, but there is no doubt that underlying the issue there is a big principle which the Government has to face.
('53', 233, 3, 9, 448774) In my opinion, that principle is an integral part of the Settlement, namely, that between the people and the Government the Congress is an intermediary.
('53', 233, 3, 10, 448927) If that fact is not recognized, the Settlement is a nullity, and I fear that it is because the Government do not wish to recognize this natural consequence of the Settlement that Government has broken on the Bardoli matter.
('53', 233, 3, 11, 449151) Whether relief is granted through a board of arbitration or an impartial acceptable inquiry I do not mind.
('53', 233, 3, 12, 449258) There is not the slightest desire to humiliate or embarrass the Government or anybody.
('53', 233, 3, 13, 449345) The only desire is to get justice, somehow or other.
('53', 233, 3, 14, 449398) Let it be after the Governments manner but it must be justice that would be acknowledged as such by those who are striving for it.
('53', 233, 4, 15, 449529) Asked about the Press report that the Congress was fast preparing for war, that instructions had been sent out to various Congress officials not to obey the orders of the Government calculated to prevent them from enjoying or exercising their lawful rights as regards picketing of foreign cloth and liquor shops, that word had been sent round to the peasants of Kaira and Surat Districts asking them not to pay land revenue more than they could afford and to face the consequences and that the Congress Secretary at Allahabad had been empowered to issue instructions to kisan leaders of the U.P. to resist all measures of repression by zamindars or Government servants,
('53', 233, 5, 16, 450199) 1 In which he had said: I cannot persuade myself to believe that, where the differences between the Government and the Congress have been reduced to such a small, though important, issue and where the justice of the demand is so clear, the Premier and his colleagues will allow the earnest and arduous labours of the last many months to be defeated, the whole object of which was to secure the representation of the Congress at the Round Table Conference.

('53', 234, 1, 2, 450699) Gandhiji said: This is a deliberate lie.
('53', 234, 1, 3, 450740) No such instructions have been issued to anybody.
('53', 234, 1, 4, 450790) Not only that, instructions have been issued all over the country that the Delhi Pact should be carried out and that nobody should disobey any Government order without the permission of the headquarters.
('53', 234, 1, 5, 450994) I know that the Congress Working Committee is anxious to carry out the Delhi Pact honourably, but if Provincial Governments goad us we shall have to take the defensive.
('53', 234, 1, 6, 451163) I have gathered ample evidence to prove that goading has already begun.

('53', 235, 3, 4, 451848) DEAR FRIEND, I know you will forgive me for this late acknowledgement of your kind letter of 4th inst.
('53', 235, 3, 5, 451951) I have been working against time and I knew that there was no hurry about answering your question.
('53', 235, 3, 6, 452050) If a person or a firm dealing in Indian cloth also imports foreign cloth, that person or firm whether Indian or European would certainly be liable to boycott.
('53', 235, 3, 7, 452209) And this, in my opinion, is in no way contrary to the Pact.
('53', 235, 3, 8, 452269) On no other condition can boycott of foreign cloth be effective.
('53', 235, 3, 9, 452334) If you once recognize the propriety and necessity of boycott of foreign cloth, the other follows as a matter of course.

('53', 235, 8, 15, 452593) MY DEAR BOYD, I purposely refrained from writing to you in answer to your letter.
('53', 235, 8, 16, 452675) I was waiting to know what was to happen.
('53', 235, 8, 17, 452717) Now of course you know the result but supposing all the negotiations that are going on materialize and that ultimately I am obliged to go, I should still feel that you should not go as one of the companions.
('53', 235, 8, 18, 452925) But several would be travelling on their own and you may also do likewise.
('53', 235, 8, 19, 453000) What I feel that I should be going just as I am.
('53', 235, 8, 20, 453049) I do not know whether you appreciate the force of my going in that absolutely detached condition This may either come from arrogance or from utter trustfulness in God.
('53', 235, 8, 21, 453217) I am certain that it is the latter with me.
('53', 235, 8, 22, 453261) The more I think of the tremendous difficulties ahead and my own very limited powers, the clearer my helplessness becomes to me.
('53', 235, 8, 23, 453390) I therefore say to

('53', 236, 6, 9, 453818) You evidently seem to imagine that I have an unlimited purse.
('53', 236, 6, 10, 453880) The fact is that I have not even a farthing I can call my own.
('53', 236, 6, 11, 453943) I have certainly control over some funds but they are all earmarked.
('53', 236, 6, 12, 454012) It therefore, I undertook to do anything in connection with your proposal I should have to beg, but you would not expect me to add to the number of begging bowls I carry with me.

('53', 237, 5, 15, 455417) It is evidence of your trust in me and I appreciate it.

('53', 237, 5, 17, 455531) I must now make a confession.
('53', 237, 5, 18, 455561) You can have no knowledge of my amazing dullness and ignorance.
('53', 237, 5, 19, 455625) You will be surprised to know that I do not know what really the game of hockey is.
('53', 237, 5, 20, 455709) I did not know that the masses were interested in it.
('53', 237, 5, 21, 455763) I have never, to my recollection, watched any game either in England, South Africa or in India.
('53', 237, 5, 22, 455859) I have never attended cricket matches and only once took a bat and a cricket ball in my hands and that was under compulsion from the head master of the High School where I was studying, and this was over 45 years ago.
('53', 237, 5, 23, 456077) This confession does not in any shape or form mean that I am opposed to games, only I have never been able to interest myself in them.
('53', 237, 5, 24, 456212) In the circumstances it would simply mystify the people if I now came out with a new card even though it might be for the laudable purpose of winning more English friendships and more English sympathy and support for the cause which makes life worth living.

('53', 239, 3, 4, 458291) Gandhijis attention was drawn this morning to an interview given by Sir Prabhashankar Pattani to a Bombay paper and I tried to elicit his views on the proposal enunciated in it, namely, the appointment of a tribunal of three officials with one High Court Judge.
('53', 239, 4, 5, 458553) Although Gandhiji was reluctant to express his opinion on the proposal, I had a long conversation with him from which it could be gathered that Gandhiji does not mind whether it be an enquiry or a tribunal, but what he really wants is the grant of the substance of his demand.
('53', 239, 4, 6, 458830) He said: What is in a name?
('53', 239, 4, 7, 458858) I would be satisfied with anything that gives me the substance.
('53', 239, 5, 8, 458922) Gandhiji said that he would be satisfied if an enquiry on the lines indicated by Sir P. Pattani was given by the Government.

('53', 239, 8, 12, 459124) Q. Isnt it tantamount to feeding milk to a serpent if at present an order is placed for British machinery for about half a dozen mills in Ahmedabad ?
('53', 239, 9, 13, 459274) A. Our struggle will gain some strength if an order for British machinery is placed during the Settlement.
('53', 239, 9, 14, 459381) We have no enmity with the British.
('53', 239, 9, 15, 459417) If the struggle is resumed while the order for British machinery is being executed, you should not take exception to goods which have already been ordered.
('53', 239, 9, 16, 459573) We cannot win swaraj by creating enmity in this way.
('53', 239, 9, 17, 459626) You should refuse to accept British goods if the struggle is resumed and they treat you as their enemies.
('53', 239, 9, 18, 459732) One can buy foreign goods so long as Congress has not declared a boycott of foreign goods.
('53', 239, 10, 19, 459823) Q. Will not an increase in the number of mills hinder the progress of khadi ?
('53', 239, 11, 20, 459901) A. The progress of khadi will be hindered not by an increase in the number of mills, but by a decrease in our love for khadi.

('53', 240, 3, 4, 460248) 273. THE REAL ISSUE
('53', 240, 4, 5, 460268) Though apparently very little difference between the Govern ment and the Congress led to the decision 1 of the Working Committee not to send me to London, really the difference was fundamental.
('53', 240, 4, 6, 460462) This will be clear to everyone who would patiently go through the correspondence published in this issue of Young India.
('53', 240, 4, 7, 460583) In the very first days of the working of the Settlement Mr. Emerson raised the question.
('53', 240, 4, 8, 460672) He contended that the Congress could not act as the intermediary between the Government and the people whom it represented.
('53', 240, 4, 9, 460796) I joined issue on it.
('53', 240, 4, 10, 460818) The legal point was never finally settled.
('53', 240, 4, 11, 460861) I had no desire to embarrass or humiliate the Government.
('53', 240, 4, 12, 460919) I was therefore content so long as in practice the Congress mediation was accepted.
('53', 240, 4, 13, 461003) The reader will see with what reluctance Mr. Garrett reconciled himself to the position.
('53', 240, 4, 14, 461092) 2 But he never pardoned the Congress for presuming to represent the peasantry.
('53', 240, 4, 15, 461171) Had he had his way, it is likely that he would rather have collected what he could through coercion than received all but a few thousand of the current dues in Bardoli and Borsad through the Congress agency.
('53', 240, 4, 16, 461379) The reader will not fail to observe that notices threatening coercion were already issued.
('53', 240, 4, 17, 461470) They were not withdrawn without energetic protest lodged by me on behalf of the Congress.
('53', 240, 4, 18, 461560) It could be shown from documentary proof that occasions were not wanting, as they are not wanting now, to warrant the Congress declaring the Truce to be at an end by reason of the Provincial Governments having failed to carry out its terms.
('53', 240, 4, 19, 461801) I make bold to say that exemplary patience has been shown by the Congress in not terminating the Truce.
('53', 240, 4, 20, 461905) The charge sheet 3 will give a glimpse of breaches alleged by the Congress to have been made by respective Provincial Governments.
('53', 240, 4, 21, 462036) Nor need the reader think that the charge sheet is an exhaustive catalogue of breaches.
('53', 240, 4, 22, 462124) For instance,

('53', 241, 0, 1, 462277) 242 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 241, 1, 2, 462319) there are several hundred civil resistance prisoners who are still rotting in jail but who according to the opinion of Congress workers are entitled to discharge.
('53', 241, 1, 3, 462482) Strange as it may appear to the reader, these cases are still pending before the Provincial Governments.
('53', 241, 1, 4, 462587) Hence they do not appear on the charge sheet presented at Simla.
('53', 241, 1, 5, 462652) It contains cases about which adverse decisions have already been given by Provincial Governments.
('53', 241, 1, 6, 462751) In fairness to the Central Government I must add that in some few cases mentioned in the charge sheet relief has since been given and it is possible that it may be given in some more.
('53', 241, 1, 7, 462935) But I know that there is little chance of getting relief in the vast majority of the cases.
('53', 241, 1, 8, 463027) Surely it was never contemplated that in cases in which the Congress was not satisfied there should not be an open enquiry.
('53', 241, 1, 9, 463151) If the Settlement was a legalized document the Government would be suable in a court of law.
('53', 241, 1, 10, 463244) The fact however that it is not legalized throws a double responsibility upon the Government of giving the Congress a tribunal where it can prove those breaches or where it can get an authoritative ruling on the interpretation of the several clauses of the Settlement or of its implications.
('53', 241, 1, 11, 463536) The refusal of the Government to concede the very natural implication of the Settlement shows how far the authorities in India are from recognizing the fact that the power is passing to the people, nor are they willing to acknowledge that the Congress represents the people and that its voluntary co operation should be thankfully accepted.
('53', 241, 1, 12, 463877) In their opinion, co operation should mean acceptance of their orders and authority and not mutual trust and accommodation between parties to a contract.
('53', 241, 1, 13, 464031) Everywhere Provincial Governments are looking upon Congressmen with suspicion and in some cases openly treating the Congress as an enemy.
('53', 241, 1, 14, 464169) As I write, I have before me the Bombay Government organ The Gujarat Patrika.
('53', 241, 1, 15, 464247) It contains vilification of Congress and Congressmen, reckless charges against them and in some instances even false allegations.
('53', 241, 1, 16, 464377) If it is said in answer that the Congress has done no better and that it has also committed breaches of the Settlement it will be an unfair charge to make for the simple reason that wherever breaches have been brought to my notice immediate satisfaction or explanation has been given.
('53', 241, 1, 17, 464662) The Congress would welcome an impartial investigation any day of all the charges that can be laid at its door and the Provincial Governments have not hesitated to take proceedings against Congressmen wherever they have thought it necessary.
('53', 241, 1, 18, 464903) My countercharge is that in many cases prosecutions have been persecutions, as for instance in the cases falling under section
('53', 242, 0, 1, 465030) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 243
('53', 242, 1, 2, 465074) 124 A of the Indian Penal Code.
('53', 242, 1, 3, 465106) This is the section dealing with disaffection.
('53', 242, 1, 4, 465153) Now, disaffection has been taken to mean absence of active affection or loyalty.
('53', 242, 1, 5, 465234) Hence anyone who is neutral is guilty of disaffection.
('53', 242, 1, 6, 465289) I must confess that every Congressman is even by reason of his creed guilty of sedition and he did not become less so by reason of the Settlement.
('53', 242, 1, 7, 465436) The Settlement never contemplated that the Congress should alter its goal and its goal is to destroy the existing system of government and to replace it by a wholly national government.
('53', 242, 1, 8, 465622) But I must not prolong this discussion of the Congress position.
('53', 242, 1, 9, 465687) If the Congress was unworthy of confidence, or if its demand was distasteful or unacceptable to the British Government, the Settlement should not have been entered into.
('53', 242, 1, 10, 465857) Further, if the Congress by any action on its part proved itself unworthy of confidence the Settlement should have been repudiated.
('53', 242, 1, 11, 465989) Either would have been an honest course.
('53', 242, 1, 12, 466030) But to have commenced with distrust when the ink had hardly dried on the paper on which the Settlement was written was, and still is, difficult for me to understand.
('53', 242, 1, 13, 466196) In spite, however, of my belief that Provincial Governments had committed serious breaches of the Settlement I was prepared, so far as my departure for London was concerned, to be satisfied merely with securing relief in the matter of the Bardoli collections under coercion, and there too, my submission was either to grant a refund of the collections so made or to have an impartial open enquiry so as to enable me to show that payments were in the vast majority of cases forced from the people, although they were unable to pay and therefore under the Settlement entitled to refund.
('53', 242, 1, 14, 466781) The matter would certainly not have ended there because the Working Committee would have been bound to press for redress in all the other cases.
('53', 242, 1, 15, 466926) This evidently was too much for the Government and therefore they decided to break on Bardoli.
('53', 242, 1, 16, 467021) The inference I have drawn from the conduct of Provincial Governments is that the members of the Civil Service who have the running of the provinces in their hands were really unwilling that I should proceed to London.
('53', 242, 1, 17, 467240) Had they desired otherwise it was open to them, as it is open to them even now, to make the way clear for me by treating the Congress as worthy of their trust and respect and therefore giving it satisfaction through an impartial enquiry where their decisions could not be accepted by the Congress.
('53', 242, 1, 18, 467538) It has been said that in concentrating upon matters of detail I have missed the opportunity of helping decisions on matters of higher
('53', 243, 0, 1, 467672) 244 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 243, 1, 2, 467714) interest.
('53', 243, 1, 3, 467724) I do not look at the two things separately.
('53', 243, 1, 4, 467768) The Government of India is but part of a whole imperial scheme.
('53', 243, 1, 5, 467832) It reflects the position at the centre.
('53', 243, 1, 6, 467872) The centre is therefore very like the Government of India and if the latter is not ready to recognize the right of India to govern herself unfettered by any control from outside, the centre is not likely to think or do otherwise and the closest association with the Government of India during the past four months has left on me the impression that the Civil Service is not ready to recognize the right of India to full freedom.
('53', 243, 1, 7, 468301) I have got too great a regard for their ability, powers of organization, and their influence on British public opinion to think that without their whole hearted co operation and blessing a humble person like me could possibly get anything from London.
('53', 243, 1, 8, 468553) Therefore till the members of that Service are converted there is no scope for the Congress to enter upon negotiations for full freedom.
('53', 243, 1, 9, 468690) It must go through further suffering however costly the process may be.
('53', 243, 1, 10, 468762) Bardoli therefore was for me the acid test.
('53', 243, 1, 11, 468806) It was designed to gauge the Civilian temper.
('53', 243, 1, 12, 468852) Looked at in that light it was not a small thing even as the magnetic needle on an indicator is not a small thing.

('53', 243, 3, 14, 468990) 274. SWADESHI GOODS
('53', 243, 4, 15, 469010) The Working Committee has now given us a workable definition of swadeshi goods.
('53', 243, 4, 16, 469090) It is as follows:
('53', 243, 5, 17, 469108) Swadeshi goods, not being cloth or yarn, are those goods which are wholly made in India out of raw material whether indigenous or imported by a manufacturer with not less than 75% Indian owned share capital, provided that no goods will be considered swadeshi the manufacture of which is controlled by foreigners.
('53', 243, 6, 18, 469421) For the purposes of this definition the word controlled refers to Boards of Directors and/or Managing Agents.
('53', 243, 7, 19, 469531) It shall be open to the Working Committee to publish a list from time to time of goods classed as swadeshi though they may not fully comply with the foregoing definition.
('53', 243, 7, 20, 469702) The definition is open to the objection that it allows of raw materials being imported.
('53', 243, 7, 21, 469790) This latitude was deliberately kept.
('53', 243, 7, 22, 469827) There is no harm in importing raw material when it cannot be found in India.
('53', 243, 7, 23, 469904) It is the skill that has been banished from the land or left undeveloped owing to the absence of the swadeshi spirit.
('53', 243, 7, 24, 470022) A country remains poor in
('53', 244, 0, 1, 470048) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 245
('53', 244, 1, 2, 470092) wealth, both material and intellectual, if it does not develop its handicrafts and its industries and lives a lazy parasitic life by importing all the manufactured articles from outside.
('53', 244, 1, 3, 470279) There was a time when we manufactured almost all we wanted.
('53', 244, 1, 4, 470339) The process is now reversed and we are dependent upon the outside world for most manufactured goods.
('53', 244, 1, 5, 470440) The past year brought forth a remarkable awakening of the swadeshi spirit.
('53', 244, 1, 6, 470515) It has therefore become necessary to define swadeshi goods.
('53', 244, 1, 7, 470575) But in giving a definition care had to be taken not to make the definition so narrow as to make manufacture all but impossible or so wide as to become farcical and swadeshi only in name.
('53', 244, 1, 8, 470762) We do not want to follow the frog in the well policy nor, in seeming to be international, lose our roots.
('53', 244, 1, 9, 470868) We cannot be international, if we lose our individuality, i.e., nationality.
('53', 244, 1, 10, 470945) The reader will also note that cloth or yarn whether cotton, woollen or silken is excluded from the definition.
('53', 244, 1, 11, 471057) One reason is that it is sufficiently known what is swadeshi cloth.
('53', 244, 1, 12, 471125) But the second and for me the most important is that swadeshi cloth for Congressmen means only and exclusively hand spun and hand woven khadi.
('53', 244, 1, 13, 471268) Indigenous mill cloth is meant for those whom the Congress message cannot or does not reach.
('53', 244, 1, 14, 471361) It will also be noticed that since, at the present stage of our evolution, we have to be satisfied about many things being not wholly swadeshi the Working Committee has reserved the right to issue a list from time to time of such articles as may not wholly satisfy the definition and yet to exclude them would be injurious to the best interest of the country.

('53', 244, 4, 19, 471865) I know that our country is steadily getting world sympathy and if we continue to follow the method of non violence our position will become absolutely irresistible.

('53', 245, 6, 10, 472494) MY DEAR BAPASOLA, I remember Mrs. Naidu having given a letter from you saying that Syt.
('53', 245, 6, 11, 472582) Baban Gokhalay had approved of the Swaraj Sabha money being given to the girls school, claimed to be national.
('53', 245, 6, 12, 472693) Baban Gokhalay now gives me particulars of the school showing that there is very little of nationalism about the school, and he adds that he never consented to the money being given to the school until it returned to the full nationalist position.
('53', 245, 6, 13, 472941) In the light of his letter I do not understand how you came to believe that Syt.
('53', 245, 6, 14, 473022) Gokhalay was willing to vote for the money being given to the girls school.
('53', 245, 6, 15, 473098) As you know, my endorsement was conditional upon Syt.
('53', 245, 6, 16, 473152) Baban Gokhalay being satisfied.
('53', 245, 6, 17, 473184) Now that he is definitely of opinion that the school is not national and that the money therefore should not be given to it you will please regard me also as opposed to the use of the Swaraj Sabha funds for the school.

('53', 246, 3, 5, 473675) I have been working against time but I have been attending to your matter.
('53', 246, 3, 6, 473750) I have not yet attained any success.
('53', 246, 3, 7, 473787) If the Settlement is continued I shall certainly make further effort.
('53', 246, 3, 8, 473857) If it is broken off, then, of course, I shall be of no service in cases such as yours.
('53', 246, 3, 9, 473944) There was a friend enquiring about your matter.
('53', 246, 3, 10, 473992) I sent you a message through him which I hope you duly received.

('53', 247, 3, 4, 474811) DEAR SITARAMA SASTRY, I know you will excuse me for unconscionable delay in acknowledging your letter of 28th ultimo.
('53', 247, 3, 5, 474929) I had really no time.
('53', 247, 3, 6, 474951) Your questions are simply answered.
('53', 247, 3, 7, 474987) I think that after a dhobi or any of these workers has taken foreign cloth or foreign yarn for treatment he must not be interfered with.
('53', 247, 3, 8, 475124) But there is no objection in going to their homes and telling them of the harm they do to the country by handling foreign yarn and foreign cloth.
('53', 247, 3, 9, 475270) Nor can I see any objection to having night watches when we know that the merchants will do their work even at night.
('53', 247, 3, 10, 475388) But where there is all thi obstinacy, reliance should be put more upon persuasion in the merchants own home than upon watching him.
('53', 247, 3, 11, 475520) After all we want to use picketing purely as a moral force working as a heaven in the community but not in order to harass people or to exercise any undue influence over them.
('53', 247, 3, 12, 475696) Persuasion after purchase is reprehensible and savours of undue influence.
('53', 247, 3, 13, 475771) What is the use of worrying a man after he has made the purchase?
('53', 247, 3, 14, 475837) I think this answers all your questions.
('53', 247, 3, 15, 475878) I do not know that my answer is of any use at this late hour.

('53', 248, 6, 9, 476747) You have bound me well enough.
('53', 248, 6, 10, 476778) However, one has got to see even the terrible form in which God sometimes shows Himself.
('53', 248, 6, 11, 476867) There are bound to be attacks on our faith.
('53', 248, 6, 12, 476911) It is necessary that it should be tested.
('53', 248, 6, 13, 476953) Though I am filled with the spirit of non violence, there must of course be a little violence lurking in me somewhere.
('53', 248, 6, 14, 477072) Hence, there are hours when I lose faith in myself.
('53', 248, 6, 15, 477124) But I hope and pray that I shall not lose it permanently.
('53', 248, 6, 16, 477182) I should like you to join me in that hope and that prayer!

('53', 248, 11, 21, 477371) Interviewed by the Chronicle correspondent this noon, with regard to Mr. Brelvis telegram, Mahatmaji gave this following statement: The message you have shown me causes me no surprise.
('53', 248, 11, 22, 477556) There were no negotiations being carried on.
('53', 248, 11, 23, 477601) Therefore, there was no question of closing them.
('53', 248, 11, 24, 477651) My going to London became remote on the 13th instant, when the Viceregal wire was received.
('53', 248, 11, 25, 477743) It is no more remote now than it became then.
('53', 248, 11, 26, 477789) I do not understand what is meant by Government is prepared

('53', 249, 1, 2, 477891) to accept my challenge.
('53', 249, 1, 3, 477915) I have issued no challenge.
('53', 249, 1, 4, 477943) Whatever I have said has been published in the correspondence.
('53', 249, 1, 5, 478006) If my letter to the Collector of Surat be regarded as a challenge, then that letter undoubtedly stands.
('53', 249, 1, 6, 478110) The material result has been already achieved, that is to say, I could not go to London.
('53', 249, 1, 7, 478199) The honour of the Congress pledge to Bardoli peasants was thereby vindicated.
('53', 249, 1, 8, 478277) The rest is in the lap of the Government.
('53', 249, 1, 9, 478319) Whatever the final decision of the Government may be, I decline to believe that it can possibly be affected by the publication of the charge sheet which was part of the relevant correspondence.
('53', 249, 1, 10, 478513) This publication was authorized by the telegram of 14th from Simla and already published.
('53', 249, 1, 11, 478603) So far as countercharges are concerned, I should welcome them as also the impartial tribunal to investigate these charges.
('53', 249, 1, 12, 478726) Indeed, I will be prepared to advise the Working Committee to accept even a one sided tribunal, that is, a tribunal that may confine its attention only to investigate the countercharges.
('53', 249, 1, 13, 478913) The Congress has nothing to lose by a public enquiry into the allegations made against it.
('53', 249, 2, 14, 479004) Concluding, he stated that he had no hope of going to London in the present circumstances.

('53', 249, 5, 19, 479783) Indeed, the reference to it in the Viceroys letter to me, which was published at Simla, made it imperative for me to publish the

('53', 250, 1, 3, 480018) There was an insistent demand for it by many people and I think that demand was reasonable and just.
('53', 250, 1, 4, 480119) Moreover, without publishing the charge sheet, I could not present the Congress case in its completeness.
('53', 250, 1, 5, 480225) Lastly, I published the papers only after getting the permission of the Viceroy.
('53', 250, 1, 6, 480306) I am, therefore, wholly unrepentant regarding the publication of the charge sheet.
('53', 250, 1, 7, 480389) So far as countercharges against the Congress are concerned, I will welcome them and I would like them to be sifted and investigated by an impartial tribunal.

('53', 251, 26, 39, 483154) But of course your charge is baseless.

('53', 252, 1, 2, 483307) I say nothing I also feel nothing about Bengal.
('53', 252, 1, 3, 483355) Some of my deepest feelings remain unexpressed and perhaps such strength as I possess is due to my ability to suppress my feelings.
('53', 252, 1, 4, 483487) You are wholly wrong in thinking that either Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel or I have any partiality.
('53', 252, 1, 5, 483583) The fact is that we have been helpless to do anything.
('53', 252, 1, 6, 483638) But I know that I do not need to defend myself before you and I know too that you have written without meaning it.
('53', 252, 1, 7, 483753) Well, after all I am not going.
('53', 252, 1, 8, 483785) But if you are tired of life and things there, why dont you come to the Ashram and stay there?
('53', 252, 1, 9, 483880) I know that the dry climate does not suit the ordinary Bengali constitution, but with your strong will, if you find the mental atmosphere to be agreeable, you will adapt yourself to the physical.
('53', 252, 1, 10, 484076) I am in Ahmedabad, I hope, at least till the 10th September.
('53', 252, 1, 11, 484137) As you know, the Working Committee meets on the 8th.
('53', 252, 1, 12, 484190) I am myself not living at the Ashram, but at the Vidyapith.

('53', 252, 6, 19, 484503) DEAR SATISBABU, I have your letter.
('53', 252, 6, 20, 484539) I am suffering from writers cramp and so the right hand is resting.
('53', 252, 6, 21, 484607) There was a telegraphic appeal by Dr. Roy regarding Bengal floods in reply to which I wrote to him day before yesterday.
('53', 252, 6, 22, 484728) 1 I do not repeat what I have written as I have no doubt you will see this letter.
('53', 252, 6, 23, 484811) If I could possibly have done it I would have made an appeal to the generosity of Bombay.
('53', 252, 6, 24, 484901) But knowing the condition of Bombay as I do and knowing also that there have been several calls upon Bombays purse regarding local matters, I have not had the courage to make any

('53', 253, 1, 2, 485164) appeal and if I did, I would have to make a fourfold appeal, that is, on behalf of Ratnagiri, Bihar, Assam and Bengal because there are equally piteous appeals from the other three places as from Bengal.
('53', 253, 1, 3, 485368) The Bihar appeal came whilst the Working Committee was sitting.
('53', 253, 1, 4, 485432) I sent Jamnalalji to a friend who could not pay a single pie, and so out of an earmarked fund I asked Jamnalalji to send Rs. 2,000 to Champaran.
('53', 253, 1, 5, 485577) Of course they want much more and they have no Roy or Satis Babu to organize relief.
('53', 253, 1, 6, 485662) I would, therefore, say that you should concentrate upon Calcutta, and I do not think you will be disappointed.
('53', 253, 1, 7, 485774) All the same, if you think that I can do anything, you will please tell me.
('53', 253, 1, 8, 485850) Your description of Bengal politics makes very sad reading.
('53', 253, 1, 9, 485910) I do not know what is to be done except that we must live correctly and not bend before the storm.
('53', 253, 1, 10, 486009) Is your paper becoming popular?
('53', 253, 1, 11, 486041) And is it producing any effect on the people?
('53', 253, 1, 12, 486087) Whilst I like the idea of your doing relief work, the fact that you have just risen from sick bed makes me anxious.
('53', 253, 1, 13, 486203) I suppose you will have to tour the distressed areas.
('53', 253, 1, 14, 486257) I do not know how you will fare there.
('53', 253, 1, 15, 486296) You will remember that you have not today the same robust constitution that you had during the last period of distress when you built that great embankment.
('53', 253, 1, 16, 486453) You must now recognize your limitation.
('53', 253, 1, 17, 486493) You will therefore please go slowly.
('53', 253, 1, 18, 486530) Charu sent me yesterday some black and coloured blocks.
('53', 253, 1, 19, 486586) He has given me no description.
('53', 253, 1, 20, 486618) I could see from letterpress that they were meant in connection with the Autobiography.
('53', 253, 1, 21, 486706) In the three or four lines that he sent he referred to the different inks.
('53', 253, 1, 22, 486781) Probably these blocks were sent to me to show what inks were produced by Satis Babu.
('53', 253, 1, 23, 486866) Are the Autobiography and the Gita translation still in demand?
('53', 253, 1, 24, 486930) Please keep me fully informed of all your movements.
('53', 253, 1, 25, 486983) I am here at least up to the 8th September, i.e., barring accidents.
('53', 253, 1, 26, 487052) That is the time when the Working Committee meets.
('53', 253, 1, 27, 487103) You need not attach any importance to the talks of the possibility of my still going to London.
('53', 253, 1, 28, 487199) I know that some friends are trying, but I expect no result from their attempt, for as I have said in my article 1 in Young India the issue is far more important and wider than the giving of satisfaction to Bardoli.

('53', 254, 6, 8, 487793) MY DEAR NARIMAN, I have seen your letter to Mahadev.
('53', 254, 6, 9, 487846) When I mentioned picketing in the charge sheet I certainly did not have Bombay in my mind, whether regarding the molestation of the picketers or regarding laxity of excise administration.
('53', 254, 6, 10, 488034) Bombay therefore is a slip.
('53', 254, 6, 11, 488062) I do not know now how the slip occurred.
('53', 254, 6, 12, 488103) In any event I had the Presidency in my mind and then too I had Ahmedabad, Surat District and Ratnagiri District in mind.
('53', 254, 6, 13, 488225) I am sorry therefore for any inadvertent reflection upon the Bombay police.
('53', 254, 6, 14, 488301) I am glad that so far as the police conduct is concerned you have nothing to complain against them in Bombay.
('53', 254, 6, 15, 488411) You can make what use you like of this letter.
('53', 254, 6, 16, 488458) With reference to Mr. Joshi I had advice from the Bombay Government saying that the orders regarding him had already been withdrawn.
('53', 254, 6, 17, 488591) You will see in the introduction to the correspondence in Young India 1 that acknowledgment has been made that in some cases relief had already been granted.

('53', 256, 3, 4, 490141) MY DEAR TIMMAPPA, Kakasaheb has handed your letter to me for reply.
('53', 256, 3, 5, 490209) I never suggested that any of the Seva Dal people had actually taken a perpetual vow of ahimsa.
('53', 256, 3, 6, 490305) What I said 1 at the morning meeting you refer to was an expression of my own longing as also expectation, and those who were there seemed to assent to the proposition that with the Seva Dal people non violence must not merely be a policy but it should be a creed.
('53', 256, 3, 7, 490570) I quite agree with you that there cannot be a sudden transformation in a minute because I desire something or because the Seva Dal becomes a full fledged Congress organization.
('53', 256, 3, 8, 490747) For me it is enough that you say that the volunteers acquitted themselves creditably during the last struggle and strove to live up to non violence.
('53', 256, 3, 9, 490896) I may however add that Dr. Hardikar had more than one conversation with me and he told me that with him non violence was fast becoming a creed if it had not already become so.
('53', 256, 3, 10, 491072) With reference to boycott I hope to find some time to make my position clear, if it is at all possible, in the pages of Young India.
('53', 256, 3, 11, 491205) You have stated it correctly.
('53', 256, 3, 12, 491235) The information that you received that in emergency volunteers may adopt foreign dress to escape detection is wholly wrong.
('53', 256, 3, 13, 491359) I have never held such a view, much less expressed it.

('53', 257, 3, 4, 491680) MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL, This will be given to you by Srinivasa Sharma of Meerut.
('53', 257, 3, 5, 491757) He has found his way to the Ashram and as he seemed to be very importunate, he was admitted.
('53', 257, 3, 6, 491850) He did not then say that he had really deserted his wife and run away from his place because he was heavily in debt.
('53', 257, 3, 7, 491967) He felt penitent three or four days ago and confessed that he had left his wife and that he had creditors for nearly Rs. 1,000. He is therefore afraid to return to Meerut.
('53', 257, 3, 8, 492139) I have advised him to seek some work in U.P. He seems to have been a volunteer also in Allahabad.
('53', 257, 3, 9, 492237) I had only one chat with him and he impressed me as a sincere man wishing to do the right thing.
('53', 257, 3, 10, 492334) He is now going to Allahabad and will see you.
('53', 257, 3, 11, 492381) I would suggest your putting him somewhere, insisting on his sending for his wife and finding out something about his creditors.
('53', 257, 3, 12, 492510) If he proves a reliable worker he might be of great use.
('53', 257, 3, 13, 492567) If, however, you cannot accommodate him anywhere and consider it too much of a bother in the midst of your work you may dismiss him from your mind.

('53', 260, 3, 6, 495545) Pyarelal had paid a part of the bill and, for the rest, he had asked him to write to you and ask you to debit the sum to him.

('53', 260, 3, 8, 495753) 2. It was agreed to pay a scholarship to Gajanan, Panditjis nephew, and the decision is right.

('53', 260, 7, 18, 496406) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter for which I thank you.
('53', 260, 7, 19, 496461) I did not say to Dr. Ambedkar that Congress had spent 20 lacs of rupees on behalf of the depressed classes.
('53', 260, 7, 20, 496569) But I did say that about that sum was spent on behalf of the Congress or by Congressmen.

('53', 261, 1, 2, 496742) challenged this statement and I then promised that I would have the figures collected and published, which I propose to do as soon as I have collected them.
('53', 261, 1, 3, 496899) As monies were distributed by different agencies it may take a little time.
('53', 261, 1, 4, 496975) The public will be astonished when they see the figures.
('53', 261, 1, 5, 497032) I was never in doubt as to the amount of work done through the congress agencies in this matter and so I never troubled to collect statistics.
('53', 261, 1, 6, 497175) But Dr. Ambedkars disbelief naturally set me thinking.
('53', 261, 1, 7, 497230) Your letter enforces the necessity of publishing them.

('53', 261, 8, 15, 497583) Asked what Gandhiji meant by his statement to the Bombay Chronicle representative, 1 viz., Indeed I will be prepared to advise the Working Committee to accept even a one sided tribunal, that is, a tribunal that may confine its attention only to investigate the countercharges Gandhiji replied: I am not prepared to give up my demand for an impartial enquiry into the charges brought by the Congress, but what I said to the Chronicle representative was that I would be prepared to advise the Working Committee to face an enquiry that would only investigate charges against the Congress.
('53', 261, 8, 16, 498169) In other words, I would not make it a condition precedent that the tribunal that goes into the charges against the Congress should also investigate the charges by the Congress against the Provincial Governments.

('53', 263, 3, 5, 500286) I do not envy your work in Bengal.
('53', 263, 3, 6, 500321) But I know you have shoulders broad enough to hear much greater burdens, and it is a matter of great joy to me that you enjoy the full confidence of both the parties.
('53', 263, 3, 7, 500488) Your decision will clear the air and let the public know where truth lies.
('53', 263, 3, 8, 500563) I do not know what is going to happen about the negotiations that so many friends are carrying on with the Central Government.
('53', 263, 3, 9, 500690) I see a lot of misunderstanding growing up in the newspapers.
('53', 263, 3, 10, 500752) I sent a simple telegram to the Viceroy yesterday restating our position and offering to discuss with him personally, if he thought it necessary, any matter that might require clearing up.
('53', 263, 3, 11, 500941) I thought that I would not publish that telegram in order to avoid any embarrassment to him.
('53', 263, 3, 12, 501034) But just at present nothing that I can say even in whispers escapes Pressmen and so you see a garbled report in the Press.
('53', 263, 3, 13, 501157) I have had no reply to my telegram as yet.

('53', 266, 3, 5, 504262) I have never said to anybody or at the All India Congress Committee meeting that, even though the Government carried out the terms of the Truce, I would not go because of the Hindu Muslim dissensions.
('53', 266, 3, 6, 504463) But let us hope that Pandit Sunderlal never said what is imputed to him.
('53', 266, 3, 7, 504536) All the same I am writing to him.
('53', 266, 4, 8, 504570) Yours sincerely, PROF.

('53', 267, 12, 19, 505947) AHMEDABAD, P.B. 26, August 22, 1931
('53', 267, 13, 20, 505983) JAMNALAL, I get no time to write to you.
('53', 267, 13, 21, 506024) I still do not use the right hand, and so I cannot write much.
('53', 267, 13, 22, 506087) I write only as much as I can with the left hand.
('53', 267, 13, 23, 506137) You must have received the letters I sent you yesterday.
('53', 268, 0, 1, 506194) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 269
('53', 268, 1, 2, 506238) very necessary to calculate the total money spent on the cause of the removal of untouchability, by the Congress, by Congressmen or through them or through their inspiration.
('53', 268, 1, 3, 506413) Some figures I already know.
('53', 268, 1, 4, 506442) Probably you, too, know some.
('53', 268, 1, 5, 506472) I wish to entrust this responsibility to you.
('53', 268, 1, 6, 506518) Collect the figures from all sources.
('53', 268, 1, 7, 506556) If any items are left out, I will try and remember them.
('53', 268, 1, 8, 506613) I estimate the figure at 20 lakhs.
('53', 268, 1, 9, 506648) I think this is a conservative rather than a liberal estimate.
('53', 268, 1, 10, 506711) Some contributions to the Tilak Fund were actually earmarked for this cause.
('53', 268, 1, 11, 506788) You will get them from the list of contributions to that Fund which you have with you.
('53', 268, 1, 12, 506875) Has anything been done about the plot of land in Almora?
('53', 268, 1, 13, 506932) If nothing has been done, and if immediate action can be taken, I think it very necessary that it should be taken.
('53', 268, 1, 14, 507047) How are Janakibehn and Balkrishna?
('53', 268, 1, 15, 507082) As there was a great deal of misunderstanding in newspapers and I began to get all kindsof reports, I sent a telegram to the Viceroy yesterday.
('53', 268, 1, 16, 507226) I have not received a reply so far.
('53', 268, 1, 17, 507262) I enclose a copy of my telegram.
('53', 268, 1, 18, 507295) Shri Pattani is coming here tomorrow.

('53', 269, 3, 7, 508001) I am here till September 8. It is being discussed whether I should go to England.

('53', 269, 6, 14, 508297) 315. STATEMENT TO ASSOCIATED PRESS
('53', 269, 7, 15, 508332) AHMEDABAD, August 22, 1931 I do not consider the Viceroys reply 1 to be at all bad or disappointing.
('53', 269, 7, 16, 508433) In fact I was prepared for some such reply.
('53', 269, 7, 17, 508477) I am glad too that, so far as I can understand the letter, the Government do not intend to terminate the Settlement and as the public is well aware, the Working Committee of the Congress has already passed a resolution to that effect.
('53', 269, 7, 18, 508712) I am therefore hoping that all Congressmen will meticulously observe the Settlement.
('53', 269, 7, 19, 508797) So far as the charges against the Congress are concerned and so far as the denial of the charges by the Congress against the Provincial authorities is concerned, that is a matter of opinion.
('53', 269, 7, 20, 508988) When the expected countercharge sheet against the Congress is published, I shall be able to deal with it.
('53', 269, 7, 21, 509094) For the moment, I can only say that the Working Committee of the Congress has been most anxious that the Congress should present an absolutely clean slate.
('53', 269, 8, 22, 509250) 1 Presumably, to Gandhijis letter of August 14, 1931; vide Letter to Viceroy, 14 8 1931 According to Dr. Pattabhi Sitaramayya, the Viceroy had stated that Government would continue to avoid resort to special measures so far as possible restricting action to the requirements of the specific situation, describing Gandhijis not attending the Round Table Conference as failure of one of the main objects of the settlement.
('53', 270, 0, 1, 509671) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 271
('53', 270, 1, 2, 509715) I know the belief of the Government regarding the Frontier Province and the U.P. I have always combated that belief, but it has been a tug of war between two beliefs.
('53', 270, 1, 3, 509882) All I can say is that I have done everything I could to ascertain the facts for myself, and I have not been able except in isolated cases to detect any breach on the part of Congressmen.
('53', 270, 1, 4, 510069) Wherever it has been detected I have made admission and amends where possible to the Government.
('53', 270, 1, 5, 510166) So far as charges against Provincial authorities are concerned, I have offered on behalf of the Working Committee to establish them before an impartial tribunal.
('53', 270, 1, 6, 510328) I could not do anything more and it would be a breach of duty to the Congress if I was satisfied with anything less.
('53', 270, 1, 7, 510445) I fully acknowledge and am aware that the refusal of the Congress to be represented at the R.T.C. involves the failure of one of the main objects of the Settlement.
('53', 270, 1, 8, 510610) I regret it as much as the Government, but the Working Committee was helpless.
('53', 270, 1, 9, 510689) Attendance at the Conference was conditional upon the fulfil ment of the Settlement by the Government.
('53', 270, 1, 10, 510792) Rightly or wrongly the Working Committee came to the conclusion, and I associate myself with the conclusion, that the Provincial Governments have in more instances than one failed to implement the Settlement.
('53', 270, 1, 11, 511001) With that belief it is not possible for the Congress to be represented at Round Table Conference unless a way is found, namely, the appointment of a tribunal or reasonable satisfaction to the Congress in some other manner.
('53', 270, 2, 12, 511224) In the midst therefore of conflict of opinion there should be a referee.
('53', 270, 2, 13, 511297) My suggestion for a tribunal is, therefore, the most natural corollary.
('53', 270, 2, 14, 511369) What shape that tribunal should take is undoubtedly a matter for mutual discussion and accommodation.
('53', 270, 2, 15, 511471) Personally, I should be satisfied so long as there is reasonable assurance of impartiality from the tribunal.
('53', 270, 2, 16, 511581) The appointment of such a tribunal can in no way diminish the dignity, prestige or authority of the Government.
('53', 270, 2, 17, 511693) I hold that such an appointment is an ordinary function of a well ordered Government and if this very Government has appointed committees of enquiry for matters outside contractual relations, how much greater there must be the need for such a tribunal when parties to the contract are dissatisfied as to the conduct of each towards the other and arising out of the contract itself ?

('53', 271, 2, 3, 512286) AHMEDABAD, August 22, 1931
('53', 271, 3, 4, 512313) If instead of replying whether the Truce terminates or continues, the Government arrests leaders, will the Congress renew the fight automatically, or will permission be required?
('53', 271, 3, 5, 512492) This was one of the questions put to Mr. Gandhi this evening at prayer time.
('53', 271, 3, 6, 512569) Mr. Gandhi replied that the fight could not be renewed till the Working Committee gave permission.
('53', 271, 3, 7, 512668) He had, however, received the Viceroys reply in which it was stated that the Government did not desire to terminate the Truce.
('53', 271, 3, 8, 512795) The fight could not, therefore, be renewed automatically.

('53', 271, 5, 10, 512883) 317. BURNT ROPE RETAINS TWIST
('53', 271, 6, 11, 512913) Ordinarily, when we burn wood, cloth and such other things, they are reduced to a small heap of ashes.
('53', 271, 6, 12, 513016) About the coir rope, however, people believe and the belief is correct, that when it is burnt its twisted shape remains.
('53', 271, 6, 13, 513137) It will disappear only when we crush the ashes with our hands.
('53', 271, 6, 14, 513200) Something similar may be said about this Government.
('53', 271, 6, 15, 513253) If this were not true, why should it be reluctant to agree to set up an impartial tribunal to resolve the difference that has arisen regarding the implementation of the Settlement signed by the Government and the Congress?
('53', 271, 6, 16, 513476) This Settlement is a kind of contract.
('53', 271, 6, 17, 513515) Any dispute that may arise about a contract is decided by a court, no matter whether we call it a board of arbitrators or a court of law.
('53', 271, 6, 18, 513653) The basic point is that only a disinterested party should decide the issue.
('53', 271, 6, 19, 513729) Is there anything special about the Settlement between the Government and the Congress that the Settlement cannot be submitted to a tribunal?
('53', 271, 6, 20, 513871) If the Government alone could decide in case of difference of opinion between it and the Congress, where was the utility of such a Settlement at all?
('53', 271, 6, 21, 514021) And why should the Congress have accepted such a Settlement?
('53', 271, 6, 22, 514082) The necessity for obtaining the decision of an impartial court or tribunal would arise only when the Congress did not agree with the Governments interpretation of any of its clauses.
('53', 271, 6, 23, 514265) If, in such an event, the Government itself assumes the role of a judge, what attitude should the Congress adopt?
('53', 271, 6, 24, 514379) What will the world think?
('53', 271, 6, 25, 514406) If the Congress keeps quiet, the only possible interpretation would be that
('53', 272, 0, 1, 514482) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 273
('53', 272, 1, 2, 514526) the Congress had become altogether powerless.
('53', 272, 1, 3, 514572) How can the Congress, an organization acting in the name of and on behalf of millions, tolerate remaining in such a helpless condition?
('53', 272, 1, 4, 514708) It exercised patience and endured the situation.
('53', 272, 1, 5, 514757) It was only when it had no alternative left and saw that injustice was being done to the poor cultivators, that it decided to tolerate the situation no longer and not to send its representative to the Round Table Conference.
('53', 272, 1, 6, 514982) It may be said that by taking that decision it has proved that it truly represents the country.
('53', 272, 1, 7, 515078) The Governments attitude, revealed at the end of the negotiations, suggests that if we are to get swaraj only through its favour, swaraj is still a long way off.
('53', 272, 1, 8, 515240) To me at least it seems dangerous simple mindedness to believe that the Governmentofficials, who are unwilling today to allow a court of law, set up as part of its own machinery, to inquire into their actions, will tomorrow relinquish power and hand it over to the people.
('53', 272, 1, 9, 515513) Fortunately no nations freedom depends on the will of a foreign government or a foreign power.
('53', 272, 1, 10, 515608) It depends only on the peoples own will and their ability to enforce it.
('53', 272, 1, 11, 515681) If the Congress lacks the strength to secure justice in a very simple matter in India, it will be able to secure nothing from England.
('53', 272, 1, 12, 515816) Looking at the matter from this standpoint, it would make no difference whether or not the Congress representative went to England.
('53', 272, 1, 13, 515948) When it becomes necessary for a representative to go there to carry on negotiations for swaraj, his path will be clear.
('53', 272, 1, 14, 516068) The refusal to meet the demands made on behalf of the Bardoli cultivators is in my opinion the plainest and clearest hint to the Congress not to send its representative to England.
('53', 272, 1, 15, 516249) Those who were eager that I should go need not at all be disappointed.
('53', 272, 1, 16, 516320) My view has always been that the nation ought not to look to England or Simla or Delhi for swaraj.
('53', 272, 1, 17, 516419) The right course for the people is to rely on themselves.
('53', 272, 1, 18, 516477) As we advance through our strength we may occasionally have to visit Delhi or Simla or England or any other place, but the people should understand that if we win anything it will be through our own strength and in the measure of our strength.

('53', 275, 8, 10, 518964) If this is true, let me know and also tell me whether you have already chosen the girl.
('53', 275, 8, 11, 519052) If I am to choose for you, tell me whether you wish to respect the restrictions of caste or Province.
('53', 275, 8, 12, 519154) You know my own views in the matter.
('53', 275, 8, 13, 519191) We wish to do away with such restrictions but in a matter like marriage I would certainly not insist on my own ideas being followed.
('53', 275, 8, 14, 519324) The inclination of the person who wishes to marry should prevail.

('53', 276, 5, 12, 520282) A Press representative asked Gandhiji:
('53', 276, 6, 13, 520321) Considering that the Government agrees to appoint a tribunal mutually acceptable to enquire into the allegations and counter allegations made by the Congress and the Government, and considering further that the Government disputes the intermediary status of the Congress being implied in the Settlement, will you agree to place this issue also before the tribunal for its decision?
('53', 276, 6, 14, 520703) Mr. Gandhi replied: If the Government appoints such a tribunal and disputes even this elementary question which I consider a part of the Pact, I will have no objection to placing even this before the tribunal and abiding by its decision.

('53', 277, 3, 9, 521992) I therefore think that you should free her.
('53', 277, 3, 10, 522036) Doctor Jivraj also examined her.
('53', 277, 3, 11, 522069) He too advises that if she finds it difficult to keep up marital relations she should be allowed to abstain.

('53', 277, 8, 22, 522623) Interviewed by the Associated Press representative, .
('53', 277, 8, 23, 522677) Mr. Gandhi declined to offer any opinion on the fall of the Labour Cabinet remarking: It is too high politics for me.
('53', 277, 9, 24, 522795) Asked whether the formation of the new Cabinet might in any way tend to alter his programme, Mr. Gandhi said: I dont think so.
('53', 277, 10, 25, 522922) Gandhiji added that his going to England depended on Government giving satisfaction to the Congress in respect of his demands.
('53', 277, 10, 26, 523049) Pressed to explain the ways in which satisfaction might be given to the Congress, especially in view of his having waived the demand for an enquiry, Mr. Gandhi stated: I dont want an enquiry for enquirys sake, and there is no

('53', 278, 1, 3, 523410) First, by conceding the Congress demand in full, secondly.
('53', 278, 1, 4, 523469) by satisfying that the demand is wrong and unjust and thirdly, by giving satisfactory assurance that satisfaction would be given.

('53', 278, 4, 8, 523668) He [Gandhiji] was uncommonly cheerful and optimistic, and though he said that the Governments answer to his charge sheet was perhaps not the last word (he did not say from whom) he appeared to be reasonably impressed by it.
('53', 278, 5, 9, 523892) He stoutly denied that it was Mr. Vallabhbhai Patel who was standing in the way of his co operation in London.
('53', 278, 5, 10, 524003) He said: I am capable of forming my own judgments.

('53', 278, 10, 15, 524312) Interviewed, Mr. Gandhi declined to disclose the result of his interview on the question of enquiry into breaches of the Pact, but said his interview was fairly satisfactory.
('53', 278, 11, 16, 524487) On his way back to Firegrove Gandhiji refused to stand beyond a minute before a group of photographers at Cecil Hotel remarking:

('53', 279, 2, 3, 524818) SIMLA, August 26, 1931
('53', 279, 3, 4, 524841) DEAR MR. EMERSON, Through the telephone you have asked me to send you the amendments that I passed over the telephone to the draft communique given me by you this afternoon.
('53', 279, 3, 5, 525015) Those amendments were suggested by my colleagues who are here.
('53', 279, 3, 6, 525078) With slight alterations I give them below: Here is the first amendment: Mr. Gandhi, while stating that the Congress were desirous that nothing should be done to the prejudice of peaceful conditions, wished to make it clear that this did not imply any undertaking restricting the future action of the Congress in the matter of continuing grievances or in respect of unforeseen developments. The portion underlined 1 represents the amendment suggested in the first sentence of paragraph 5 by my colleagues.
('53', 279, 3, 7, 525583) I need hardly say that I entirely endorse the suggestion.
('53', 279, 3, 8, 525641) You will observe that with the exception of the portion underlined, we have accepted the amendment telephoned by you.
('53', 279, 3, 9, 525759) I may say that there is no desire to insist upon the wording suggested here.
('53', 279, 3, 10, 525836) All that is sought to be made perfectly clear is that paragraph 3 of the draft communique does not in any way fetter the future action of the Congress.
('53', 279, 3, 11, 525988) Nor does it mean that for every grievance large or small there is to be insistence upon an enquiry by the Congress.
('53', 279, 3, 12, 526104) But the Congress should not be expected to waive the right to seek redress, and failing redress to adopt such measures as may seem to it to be necessary.
('53', 279, 3, 13, 526258) As a matter of fact, this is an elementary principle which does not need any enunciation.
('53', 279, 3, 14, 526348) It is brought in here to avoid any possibility of a charge of breach of faith on the part of the Congress.
('53', 279, 3, 15, 526455) This clearance has become all the more necessary because of the inferences you draw from our conversations at Richmond.
('53', 279, 3, 16, 526575) The Councils suggestion that the sentence, viz., To this the Government of India take no exception be dropped is accepted.
('53', 279, 3, 17, 526698) It is further suggested on behalf of the Congress that the rest of
('53', 279, 4, 18, 526765) 1 Here italicized
('53', 280, 0, 1, 526783) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 281
('53', 280, 1, 2, 526827) paragraph 5 should be dropped.
('53', 280, 1, 3, 526858) You will recognize that the sentence beginning so long as the Settlement.
('53', 280, 1, 4, 526932) provisions is a repetition, with slight changes, of para 2 of the communique.
('53', 280, 1, 5, 527010) The remainder of the paragraph giving a long quotation from the letter from H. E. the Viceroy addressed to me and dated the 19th inst.
('53', 280, 1, 6, 527145) torn from its context bears an altogether different meaning.
('53', 280, 1, 7, 527206) My colleagues have pointed out that the bare quotation would seem to carry an interpretation which commits me and the Congress to an endorsement of the claim that the Government of India have hitherto followed the policy of restricting action to the requirements of the specific situation.
('53', 280, 1, 8, 527496) You will agree that neither the Congress nor I have ever endorsed the claim.
('53', 280, 1, 9, 527573) On the contrary we have had the misfortune often to point out to Government that their action has in numerous cases gone beyond the requirements of specific situation.
('53', 280, 1, 10, 527741) I venture to suggest that the reminder, in a communique designed to secure peace and facilitate my departure to London on an errand of peace, that the Government possess certain powers which the Congress may not question is hardly opportune or advisable.
('53', 280, 1, 11, 527996) I do not know that the powers of the Government become any the more emphatic or operative by reason of the recital.
('53', 280, 1, 12, 528112) It had a meaning in a letter which was addressed to me to serve a purpose wholly different from the purpose that we all, I hope, have in view.
('53', 280, 1, 13, 528255) You have, in the course of the last conversation that we had over the phone, told me, on behalf of the Council, something very startling and distressing.
('53', 280, 1, 14, 528409) I can only hope that I have misunderstood your message.
('53', 280, 1, 15, 528465) It sounded very much like a breaking up of the negotiations which His Excellency, you and I had believed, had almost reached their fruition.
('53', 280, 1, 16, 528606) Surely there is nothing extraordinary in the amendments suggested herein as to lead to such a tragic end.
('53', 280, 1, 17, 528712) I can therefore only hope that having come so near, it will not be said of us, no matter whose fault it was, we had come near only in order to separate.
('53', 280, 1, 18, 528865) In my opinion there is ample room for discussion and accommodation if we mean the same thing.
('53', 280, 1, 19, 528959) If we do not, the sooner the agony of suspense ends the better.
('53', 280, 1, 20, 529023) I note your warning that the draft communique is provisional and confidential, Confidence will be respected.
('53', 280, 1, 21, 529132) Yours sincerely, H. W. EMERSON, ESQ.

('53', 281, 2, 3, 529311) The Congress lives for the labourer, and for the capitalist in so far as the latter subserves the formers purpose.
('53', 281, 2, 4, 529426) Therefore the Congress is in alliance with the mill owners in the matter of boycott of foreign cloth, only because boycott is calculated to benefit the labourer and the vast mass of consumers in the very near future.
('53', 281, 2, 5, 529643) The alliance is voluntary and capable of being broken up at the option of either party.
('53', 281, 2, 6, 529731) It can be and will be broken up when the mills find it profitless.
('53', 281, 2, 7, 529798) It may and must be broken up by the Congress if it injures khadi, or if it injures or exploits the labourer, or if it exploits the consumer.
('53', 281, 2, 8, 529939) Khadi may suffer temporary check as perhaps it has.
('53', 281, 2, 9, 529991) The consumer may, for a year or two but no longer, pay a protection duty by way of higher prices, not for the higher profit of the shareholders but for the economic working of mills.
('53', 281, 2, 10, 530174) But the Congress can never allow the labourer to be exploited.
('53', 281, 2, 11, 530237) In other words, his position must not be worse than before the boycott.
('53', 281, 2, 12, 530309) On the contrary, the alliance imposes a greater duty upon the Congress of seeing that the labourers position is all the better for it.
('53', 281, 2, 13, 530444) The Congress has to ascertain the condition of the labourers of a particular mill before it enters into any contract with it.
('53', 281, 2, 14, 530570) It was because the Working Committee realized this special obligation, that it passed the following resolution at its last meeting: 1
('53', 281, 3, 15, 530704) The Working Committee draws the attention of owners and managers of mills, especially those recognized by the Congress, to the resolution 2 of the Working Committee dated July 10th, 1931, and draws further attention to the fact, that the Working Committee has received complaints about the treatment of textile labourers and the growing discontent amongst them, as also of proposed reduction of wages in some mills.
('53', 281, 4, 16, 531120) The Committee hopes, that the owners and managers will remove all causes of discontent.
('53', 281, 4, 17, 531208) The Working Committee believes, that representing, as the Congress does predominantly, the interests of millions of agricultural and
('53', 281, 5, 18, 531341) 1 Held in Bombay from August 9 to 14 2 This read: The Working Committee is of opinion, that the Textile Mills Exemption Committee should endeavour, wherever possible and necessary, to prevent by amicable arrangement any penalization or victimization of labour in the mills which have signed the Congress declaration, and to help in the bettering of labour conditions in these mills.
('53', 282, 0, 1, 531724) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 283
('53', 282, 1, 2, 531768) industrial workers, any recognition by the Congress of the mills will be inconsistent with the claim, wherever there is previous justification for such complaints.
('53', 282, 1, 3, 531932) Among the private resolutions referred to the Committee by the A.I.C.C. at its last session was one referring to mill workers.
('53', 282, 1, 4, 532059) It was a drastic resolution.
('53', 282, 1, 5, 532088) I have before me a list of mills that are said to have threatened a cut in the wages.
('53', 282, 1, 6, 532174) The Working Committee therefore passed the foregoing mild resolution.
('53', 282, 1, 7, 532244) It enunciates its policy and duty in the matter.
('53', 282, 1, 8, 532293) It constitutes an assurance to the labourers, that the Congress will never be party to any injury to labour and it is a notice to the mill owners of the Congress policy regarding labour.
('53', 282, 1, 9, 532480) It must not on any account be treated as a threat of any kind whatsoever.
('53', 282, 1, 10, 532554) It should be as much the mill owners interest as that of the Congress to guard the well being of labour.
('53', 282, 1, 11, 532659) The peaceful road to swaraj lies through a co ordination, not antagonism, of all national effort.
('53', 282, 1, 12, 532757) And this co ordination must move towards one grand consummation Freedom of Labour, whether on the field or in the factory.

('53', 282, 5, 17, 532996) a flag by the following resolution almost unanimously passed:
('53', 282, 6, 18, 533058) The National Flag shall be three coloured, horizontally arranged as before, but the colours shall be saffron, white and green, in the order stated here, from top to bottom, with the spinning wheel in dark blue in the centre of the white stripe; it being understood that the colours have no communal significance, but that saffron shall represent courage and sacrifice, white peace and truth, and green shall represent faith and chivalry, and the spinning wheel the hope of the masses.
('53', 282, 6, 19, 533543) The proportions of the flag should be fly to hoist as three to two.
('53', 282, 6, 20, 533611) It should be remembered, that the white, green, and red tricolour flag was never authoritatively adopted by the Congress.
('53', 282, 6, 21, 533733) It was conceived by me, and I had certainly given it a communal meaning.
('53', 282, 6, 22, 533806) It was intended to represent communal unity.
('53', 282, 6, 23, 533851) The Sikhs protested and demanded their colour.
('53', 282, 6, 24, 533898) Consequently a Committee was appointed.
('53', 282, 7, 25, 533938) 1 At its session from August 6 to 8, 1931
('53', 283, 0, 1, 533980) 284 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 283, 1, 2, 534022) collected valuable evidence and made useful recommendations.
('53', 283, 1, 3, 534083) And now we have a flag, which has been authoritatively robbed of any communal meaning, and has a definite meaning assigned to each colour.
('53', 283, 1, 4, 534222) The red has been replaced by saffron colour, and is put first purely from the artistic standpoint.
('53', 283, 1, 5, 534321) White has been put between saffron and green in order to heighten the effect, and to show off the whole flag to advantage.
('53', 283, 1, 6, 534444) The wheel is to be shown on the white strip in blue black.
('53', 283, 1, 7, 534503) There can be no doubt that this is an improvement.
('53', 283, 1, 8, 534554) It is a matter of great joy that the wheel has been retained as the hope of the masses.
('53', 283, 1, 9, 534642) It has proved itself as such.
('53', 283, 1, 10, 534672) Wherever it has gone, it has brought happiness, and banished pauperism.
('53', 283, 1, 11, 534744) It is now the duty of Congress workers to explain the meaning of the national flag, and let me hope that we shall translate the full meaning into our own lives.
('53', 283, 1, 12, 534905) No doubt it will be defended with our lives, but the true defence will consist in assimilating the qualities represented by the colours and giving the spinning wheel a place in every home.
('53', 283, 1, 13, 535094) Then we shall need no picketing of foreign cloth.
('53', 283, 1, 14, 535144) If we will die for the flag, let us first learn to live for it.
('53', 283, 2, 15, 535208) TO THE PARSIS
('53', 283, 3, 16, 535222) Brave Abid Ali, being mistaken for equally brave Nariman, got nearly killed by seven injuries inflicted by some unknown Parsis infuriated projectiles,what they were I do not know.
('53', 283, 3, 17, 535402) This happened, while Davar Bar was being picketed, and S. Abid Ali was trying to disperse a crowd of do nothings.
('53', 283, 3, 18, 535516) My appeal then is to the interested Parsis and to the great Parsi philanthropists and reformers.
('53', 283, 3, 19, 535613) To the interested liquor dealers and their friends I say: My sympathy is with you as with foreign cloth dealers.
('53', 283, 3, 20, 535726) My sympathy compels me to warn both against your trade.
('53', 283, 3, 21, 535782) Both the trades must go for the sake of the poor.
('53', 283, 3, 22, 535832) And you cannot keep up either by hooliganism.
('53', 283, 3, 23, 535878) Parsis are surely shrewd enough to recognize this fact, and are resourceful to find out some other calling.
('53', 283, 3, 24, 535986) To the philanthropists I say: You have a brilliant record of philanthropy before you.
('53', 283, 3, 25, 536072) Will you not add to your record by taking in hand the Parsi dealers in liquor and put them on to some honourable occupation?
('53', 283, 3, 26, 536197) No philanthropy can possibly be compared to the one I am suggesting.
('53', 283, 3, 27, 536266) What can be nobler than that your riches are utilized for ridding the nation of the soul destroying curse of drink?

('53', 284, 1, 2, 536426) TRIALS BY JURY
('53', 284, 2, 3, 536441) A correspondent reminds me that the A.I.C.C. has omitted from its recital of fundamental rights that of trial by jury.
('53', 284, 2, 4, 536560) I do not know the mind of the other members.
('53', 284, 2, 5, 536605) Personally I would have resisted the inclusion.
('53', 284, 2, 6, 536653) I am unconvinced of the advantages of jury trials over those by judges.
('53', 284, 2, 7, 536725) In coming to a correct decision, we must not be obsessed by our unfortunate experience of the judiciary here, which in political trials has been found to be notoriously partial to the Government.
('53', 284, 2, 8, 536921) At the right moment juries have been found to fail even in England.
('53', 284, 2, 9, 536989) When passions are roused, juries are affected by them and give perverse verdicts.
('53', 284, 2, 10, 537071) Nor need we assume that they are always on the side of leniency.
('53', 284, 2, 11, 537136) I have known juries finding prisoners guilty in the face of evidence and even judges summing up to the contrary.
('53', 284, 2, 12, 537249) We must not slavishly copy all that is English.
('53', 284, 2, 13, 537297) In matters where absolute impartiality, calmness and ability to sift evidence and understand human nature are required, we may not replace trained judges by untrained men brought together by chance.
('53', 284, 2, 14, 537496) What we must aim at is an incorruptible, impartial and able judiciary right from the bottom.
('53', 284, 2, 15, 537589) I regard village panchayats as an institution by itself.
('53', 284, 2, 16, 537646) But thanks to the degradation of the caste system and the evil influence of the present system of government and the growing illiteracy of the masses, this ancient and noble institution has fallen into desuetude, and where it has not, it has lost its former purity and hold.
('53', 284, 2, 17, 537921) It must, however, be revived at any cost, if the villages are not to be ruined.
('53', 284, 3, 18, 538001) BOGUS PROVIDENT COMPANIES
('53', 284, 4, 19, 538027) Complaints about these companies still continue, which shows that the warning issued by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has not had its full effect upon these companies.
('53', 284, 4, 20, 538190) And some of them have even the audacity to threaten proceedings against the officials of the Vigilance Society established in Ahmedabad.
('53', 284, 4, 21, 538327) Some of them offer most extravagant and tempting terms, that could never be fulfilled, and yet those who are in a hurry to be rich do not mind running into these traps.
('53', 284, 4, 22, 538496) Unfortunately these companies trade upon the gullibility of poor peasants, whom they see only once, namely at the time of collecting the fee.
('53', 284, 4, 23, 538638) A correspondent asks how he is to distinguish between a sound company from a bogus one.
('53', 284, 4, 24, 538726) I would say: Shun them all.
('53', 284, 4, 25, 538754) Do not run after these tempting offers.
('53', 284, 4, 26, 538794) But if you cannot help subscribing to one of these companies, refer to the Vigilance

('53', 285, 1, 3, 538993) It has come into being purely from philanthropic motives, and for the purpose of saving poor people from avoidable losses.
('53', 285, 2, 4, 539116) A SWADESHI PHILANTHROPIC COMPANY
('53', 285, 3, 5, 539149) The Swadeshi Electric Clock Manufacturing Company has its workshop in Sastri Hall, Grant Road.
('53', 285, 3, 6, 539244) Some days ago I had the pleasure of visiting this workshop in Jamnalaljis company.
('53', 285, 3, 7, 539327) Satishbabu of Khadi Pratishthan was also with me at the time.
('53', 285, 3, 8, 539389) But as he is an expert in these matters, I asked him to visit the works again, and give me his own impressions, which he has done.
('53', 285, 3, 9, 539520) He speaks highly of the possibilities of this enterprise.
('53', 285, 3, 10, 539578) It owes its origin to the educational activities of the Tilak Rashtriya Pathshala of Nipani, a national school in Karnatak.
('53', 285, 3, 11, 539702) The school was established during the Non co operation days of 1921. Industrial education was part of its syllabus.
('53', 285, 3, 12, 539818) In Shri M. D. Joshi, a life member, the school had a technical expert of great ability.
('53', 285, 3, 13, 539906) The management therefore wanted him to take regular training, and he took the engineering course and stood first in the final examination.
('53', 285, 3, 14, 540045) Then he served as an apprentice in the B.B.&C.I. Railway Parel Workshop, and then in the Royal Indian Marine Dockyards.
('53', 285, 3, 15, 540165) During all this time he devoted his spare time to experiments in the manufacture of electric clocks.
('53', 285, 3, 16, 540266) The upshot of all these labours was the present concern which became possible through the voluntary support of Sardar Dajisaheb Patwardhan of Poona.
('53', 285, 3, 17, 540415) He lent Rs. 20,000 as capital to the company without any interest, and without even requiring any security.
('53', 285, 3, 18, 540523) Its directors are Principal Limaye of the Tilak Mahavidyalaya, Poona, Dr. R. N. Datar, Sr.
('53', 285, 3, 19, 540614) Joshi and Sr.Naravane.
('53', 285, 3, 20, 540637) These directors get no remuneration.
('53', 285, 3, 21, 540674) The whole concern is based on the principle of self sacrifice.
('53', 285, 3, 22, 540737) It gives technical education to students from national schools.
('53', 285, 3, 23, 540801) If there are any profits, they are to be devoted to the advancement of education.
('53', 285, 3, 24, 540883) The company sold clocks for nearly Rs. 15,000 last year, and they are said to have given perfect satisfaction.
('53', 285, 3, 25, 540994) The mechanism of these clocks is original and patented.
('53', 285, 3, 26, 541050) Every part of the machine is manufactured and other processes completed in the workshop. These clocks are designed not for the use of individuals but for offices, factories and public institutions, which require a number of clocks fitted in the same building.
('53', 285, 3, 27, 541310) They require no winding, and all the clocks in one circuit show exactly the same time.
('53', 285, 3, 28, 541397) There are six students already working in the workshop from the Nipani school.
('53', 285, 3, 29, 541476) But I must not give any more

('53', 286, 8, 12, 542118) DEAR FRIENDS, One stage in the journey is reached.
('53', 286, 8, 13, 542169) I know that I have caused you endless worry.
('53', 286, 8, 14, 542214) But the only consolation I can derive for myself and give to you lies in the fact that I have given myself no less worry and anxiety.
('53', 286, 8, 15, 542348) It never is a matter of pleasure to me to continuously differ from friends or opponents.
('53', 286, 8, 16, 542437) You will therefore believe me when I give you my assurance that if I have seemed to be obstinate or exacting all this has been in spite of myself and in response to the imperative call of duty.
('53', 286, 8, 17, 542631) Though the colleagues that have been with me have given me their heartiest co operation I know that the ultimate responsibility rests upon my shoulders.
('53', 286, 8, 18, 542784) I have not come to the decision to go to London without fear, trembling and serious misgivings.

('53', 287, 5, 13, 544111) SIMLA, August 27, 1931
('53', 287, 6, 14, 544134) DEAR MR. EMERSON, I have to acknowledge with thanks your letter of even date enclosing the new draft.
('53', 287, 6, 15, 544236) Sir Cowasji has kindly also communicated to me the amendments suggested by you.
('53', 287, 6, 16, 544316) My colleagues and I have very carefully considered the amended draft which we are prepared to accept subject to the following remarks: In paragraph 4 it is not possible for me on behalf of the Congress to subscribe to the position taken up by the Government.
('53', 287, 6, 17, 544575) For we feel that, where in the opinion of the Congress a grievance arising out of the working of the Settlement is not redressed, an enquiry is a necessity of the case, because of the fact that civil disobedience remains under suspension during the pendency of the Delhi Pact.
('53', 287, 6, 18, 544852) But if the Government of India and local Governments are not prepared to grant an enquiry, my colleagues and I have no objection to the clause remaining.
('53', 287, 6, 19, 545006) The result will be that, whilst the Congress will not press for an enquiry in regard to the other matter hitherto raised
('53', 287, 7, 20, 545127) 1 The Viceroys reply to this read: Delighted to receive your letter last night and to learn your decision.
('53', 287, 7, 21, 545234) Am sure you are right.
('53', 287, 7, 22, 545257) Send you my blessings and all good wishes.
('53', 287, 7, 23, 545300) you can entirely rely upon my assurance to you (S.N. 17601).

('53', 288, 1, 2, 545405) on its behalf, if unfortunately any grievance is so acutely felt that it becomes a paramount duty of the Congress to seek some method of relief, in the absence of an enquiry, in the shape of defensive direct action, the Congress should be held free to adopt such remedy notwithstanding the suspension of civil disobedience.
('53', 288, 1, 3, 545729) I need hardly assure the Government, that it would be the constant endeavour of the Congress to avoid direct action and to gain relief by discussion, persuasion and the like.
('53', 288, 1, 4, 545904) The statement of Congress position given here has become necessary in order to avoid any possible misunderstanding in the future or a charge of breach of faith on the part of the Congress.
('53', 288, 1, 5, 546093) In the event of a successful issue to the present discussions, I assume that the communique 1, this letter and your reply would be simultaneously published.

('53', 288, 5, 9, 546348) Reynolds as well as other friends have wanted me to take Jawaharlal with me to London at least.
('53', 288, 5, 10, 546444) He is fearless, yet gentle, being a stranger to weakness and weakening diffidence, detects weakness in a flash, having no diplomacy about him, hates diplomatic language and insists upon going straight to the point.
('53', 288, 5, 11, 546659) And as I consider myself to be in advance of him in idealism, he returns the compliment by dismissing my claim.
('53', 288, 5, 12, 546771) I honour him, and therefore share the wish, energetically expressed by so many friends, that Jawaharlal should be with me to keep me on the straight path and to serve as my dictionary of reference in case of doubt.
('53', 288, 5, 13, 546986) Other friends have wanted others to be by my side, even though they may not be delegates.
('53', 288, 5, 14, 547076) They are so thankful that Malaviyaji and Sarojini Devi will be with me as persons entitled to nomination by reason of their distinguished status apart

('53', 289, 1, 2, 547538) from their being members of the Congress and their being past presidents.
('53', 289, 1, 3, 547612) There is weight in every one of the suggestions made by these friends.
('53', 289, 1, 4, 547683) All the considerations were with the Working Committee, when, after a full and prolonged debate 1, it came to the conclusion that there should be sole delegation on behalf of the Congress.
('53', 289, 1, 5, 547872) I fully share the unanimous view expressed by the members of the Working Committee.
('53', 289, 1, 6, 547956) But just before the way became clear for me to go to London, and more when the way was opened at 7 p.m.
('53', 289, 1, 7, 548060) on the 27th, my weakness burst upon me as never before, and I have not got over it even as I dictate these lines on the train taking me to Bombay.
('53', 289, 1, 8, 548207) Something within me told me that I must not bear the burden of the Simla visits single handed, but that as the Frontier Province and the United Provinces were storm centres and as Gujarat was the special care of Sardar Vallabhbhai, he, Khan Saheb Abdul Ghaffar Khan and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru should be by my side, and that I should take no decision without their full consent and approval, and so in my telegram to the Viceroy, 2 I told him that these three would accompany me to Simla.
('53', 289, 1, 9, 548696) As I had to pass through Delhi, I telegraphed to Dr. Ansari also, so that I could have half an hour with him.
('53', 289, 1, 10, 548806) He was not in Delhi but in Mussoorie attending to a patient.
('53', 289, 1, 11, 548867) My wire was repeated to him there, and he went down post haste to Kalka to meet me since he could not catch me at Delhi, and so he too came along to Simla.
('53', 289, 1, 12, 549023) And I can thankfully confess that the presence of each one of them was most valuable to me, and I can give out the secret, that but for their presence and especially of Jawaharlals frank and insistent criticism, the Second Settlement 3, though identical in substance, would have taken a form very different from that in which it finally emerged, and I must own that the form in which it has emerged is far superior to the one to which I alone, in my trustfulness even in official nature, would have subscribed.
('53', 289, 1, 13, 549534) With that very useful experience in front of me, the reader would be entitled to say that I must either be too conceited or too dull to see that I must take these very colleagues with me to London even though they may not be with me as co delegates.
('53', 289, 1, 14, 549784) But I am not aware of any conceit in me nor of special dullness that would conceal the reality from me.

('53', 290, 1, 2, 550083) that sole delegation is the proper thing, and that their own place is not in London either as delegates or as counsellors, but at their respective posts of duty in India.
('53', 290, 1, 3, 550254) Their presence in India would be a much greater help than what is to be gained by their being available for discussions in London.
('53', 290, 1, 4, 550385) I must go to London feeling my weakness in its fulness.
('53', 290, 1, 5, 550441) I must go to London with God as my only guide.
('53', 290, 1, 6, 550488) He is a jealous Lord.
('53', 290, 1, 7, 550510) He will allow no one to share His authority.
('53', 290, 1, 8, 550555) One has therefore to appear before Him in all ones weakness, empty handed and in a spirit of full surrender, and then He enables you to stand before a whole world and protects you from all harm.
('53', 290, 1, 9, 550750) When I think of the prospects in London, when I know that all is not well in India, that the second Settlement is bereft of all grace and is charged with no pleasant memories, there is nothing wanting to fill me with utter despair.
('53', 290, 1, 10, 550982) The horizon is as black as it possibly could be.
('53', 290, 1, 11, 551031) There is every chance of my returning empty handed.
('53', 290, 1, 12, 551083) That is just the state which realization of weakness finds one in.
('53', 290, 1, 13, 551150) But believing as I do that God has made the way to London clear for me through the Second Settlement, I approach the visit with hope, and feel that any result that comes out of it would be good for the nation, if I do not prove faithless to the mandate given to me by the Congress.
('53', 290, 2, 14, 551432) THE CHARGE SHEET AND THE REPLY 1
('53', 290, 3, 15, 551465) I am sorry that the Government have published the replies of Provincial Governments to the charges mentioned against them in the charge sheet.
('53', 290, 3, 16, 551608) In my opinion the categorical denials, if they prove anything, prove the necessity for an enquiry.
('53', 290, 3, 17, 551707) An accused person does not quash a complaint by a denial of the charge against him, however emphatic his denial may be.
('53', 290, 3, 18, 551827) He has to prove his innocence before a judge.
('53', 290, 3, 19, 551873) So far as Congressmen are concerned, the denials from the Provincial Governments simply confirm them in their suspicions.
('53', 290, 3, 20, 551995) The public therefore will hear more of the charge sheet.
('53', 290, 3, 21, 552052) Mahadev Desai has given his stray impressions.
('53', 290, 3, 22, 552099) But a rejoinder is in course of preparation, 2 and I have no doubt, that when it is published, it will be found that the Congress has a good case.
('53', 290, 3, 23, 552246) If the Provincial Governments are as innocent as they claim to be, why should they shirk an impartial investigation?
('53', 290, 3, 24, 552363) But according to the Second

('53', 291, 1, 2, 552516) Settlement they refuse to face an enquiry.
('53', 291, 1, 3, 552559) The Congress has submitted to the refusal.
('53', 291, 1, 4, 552602) But it has also made it clear, that submission to the refusal need not mean submission to the injustice involved, and if there is a wrong to which, in the opinion of the Congress, it would be against the interest of the nation to submit, the Congress has reserved the right, in spite of the Settlement which contemplates suspension of civil disobedience, to take it up as a measure of self defence.
('53', 291, 1, 5, 553001) It is the only alternative to an enquiry when discussion, negotiation and petition fail.
('53', 291, 1, 6, 553090) Let me hope however that even defensive civil disobedience will be found to be unnecessary.
('53', 291, 1, 7, 553182) I know that Sardar Vallabhbhai and the Working Committee will not lightly permit any such resumption.
('53', 291, 1, 8, 553284) So far as it is humanly possible, pending the result of the London visit civil disobedience should be avoided.
('53', 291, 1, 9, 553395) But it cannot be and must not be avoided at the cost of national self respect or well being.
('53', 291, 1, 10, 553488) Let Congress Committees and individuals know that it is not open to them to take up civil disobedience on their own responsibility.
('53', 291, 1, 11, 553620) Permission of the Working Committee or the President is absolutely necessary.

('53', 291, 4, 15, 553790) MY DEAR AMTUL, So we shall not meet for some time now.
('53', 291, 4, 16, 553845) You will go away for change if you are weak and ailing and return when you have recouped yourself and the malarial season at Sabarmati is over.
('53', 291, 4, 17, 553989) In every case you must keep yourself perfectly at peace and cheerful.
('53', 291, 4, 18, 554059) Dont worry about anything.
('53', 291, 4, 19, 554086) But do such service as you can.
('53', 291, 4, 20, 554118) Let there be not a single idle moment.
('53', 291, 4, 21, 554157) You can do takli spinning, grain cleaning, sewing, cotton cleaning and many other such items of light labour.
('53', 291, 4, 22, 554267) They are just as useful as heavy labour.
('53', 291, 4, 23, 554308) All these things come naturally to those who will concentrate not upon themselves but upon the good of all and the contribution that they can make towards the promotion of that good.
('53', 291, 4, 24, 554491) You must write to me.
('53', 291, 4, 25, 554513) My address you will learn from Narayandas.

('53', 292, 2, 3, 554666) ON THE FRONTIER DOWN MAIL, August 28, 1931
('53', 292, 3, 4, 554709) DEAR FRIEND, I know you will not consider me to be discourteous because I did not acknowledge your wire in reply to mine 1 from Bombay.
('53', 292, 3, 5, 554845) The reason was simple.
('53', 292, 3, 6, 554868) I did not know what reply to send at the time.
('53', 292, 3, 7, 554915) It is only now that I can send a reply, and this I am doing during the few moments I can get on the train that is taking me to Bombay.
('53', 292, 3, 8, 555050) You will not mind my saying that your telegram was capable of being read as a promise of hope or of none.
('53', 292, 3, 9, 555156) I propose now to read in your telegram a promise of hope.
('53', 292, 3, 10, 555214) I am not aware of the legal position but I do know that you have a reputation of being able to find a way out of every difficulty, that is, if you are convinced that a way should be found out of it.
('53', 292, 3, 11, 555413) The chief difficulty in U.P. as it seems to me is the evictions already obtained and the evictions that are still continuing.
('53', 292, 3, 12, 555539) They may all be lawful but there is something wrong in a system which allows of so many evictions.
('53', 292, 3, 13, 555638) You have said in your telegram that the evictions this year do not show any excess over last year.
('53', 292, 3, 14, 555737) That may be so.
('53', 292, 3, 15, 555753) But I hardly think you will justify them on the score of a bad precedent.
('53', 292, 3, 16, 555827) With the tremendous awakening that has taken place all over India there is a sensitiveness to wrongs which was not felt 12 months ago.
('53', 292, 3, 17, 555962) I would ask you therefore to recognize this sensitiveness and deal with the wrong.
('53', 292, 3, 18, 556045) And I venture to suggest that you cannot make a better beginning than by sending for Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and establishing a direct touch with him.
('53', 292, 3, 19, 556196) Seeing that the Settlement continues I venture to suggest that Congress may be trusted and all necessary help requisitioned from it.
('53', 292, 3, 20, 556329) I am certain that the trust will not be misplaced if the cause is common as I take it is the case between us.
('53', 292, 3, 21, 556439) I have written freely because there is no other way of strengthening bonds of public friendship as of private.
('53', 292, 3, 22, 556550) I hope therefore that you will not resent my letter as a presumption.

('53', 293, 2, 3, 556872) ON THE FRONTIER DOWN MAIL, August 28, 1931
('53', 293, 3, 4, 556915) DEAR C.R., What shall I write to you?
('53', 293, 3, 5, 556953) Do you know that not a day has passed but I have thought of you and also felt the need of your presence?
('53', 293, 3, 6, 557058) But I was not to have it and as ill luck will have it, I cannot have even a few words with you before sailing.
('53', 293, 3, 7, 557169) There are two men whom I would like by my side in London, you and Jawaharlal.
('53', 293, 3, 8, 557247) But I feel that even if both of you were available I must not have you by me.
('53', 293, 3, 9, 557325) Somehow or other I do feel that you will both be helping me like the others by being here.
('53', 293, 3, 10, 557416) Only your presence with me will have lightened my burden.
('53', 293, 3, 11, 557474) But I must bear the Cross alone and to the fullest extent.
('53', 293, 3, 12, 557533) When I think of myself with all my limitations and ignorance I sink in utter despair but I rise out of it immediately, as I think and feel that it is God within Who is moving me and using me as His instrument.
('53', 293, 3, 13, 557743) He will give me the right word at the right moment.
('53', 293, 3, 14, 557795) That does not mean that I shall make no mistakes.
('53', 293, 3, 15, 557845) But I have come to believe that God as it were purposely makes us commit mistakes if only to humble us.
('53', 293, 3, 16, 557949) I know that this is a dangerous belief which can be utilized to justify any error.
('53', 293, 3, 17, 558032) But I have no doubt about its correctness in respect of all unconscious errors.
('53', 293, 3, 18, 558112) But this is not a letter to air my philosophy.
('53', 293, 3, 19, 558159) This is written to ask you to give me through weekly letters, sent even by air mail, what I cannot get through your presence.
('53', 293, 3, 20, 558285) I would like you also to write for Young India every week.
('53', 293, 3, 21, 558344) I do not think there is any legal necessity for advertising a new editor during my temporary absence.
('53', 293, 3, 22, 558446) If there is a legal necessity I would like you to wear the editorial mantle.
('53', 293, 3, 23, 558523) I would like you to prepare a rejoinder to the Madras Governments reply to the Madras charge sheet and bring the latter to date and send your rejoinder to the Sardar.
('53', 293, 3, 24, 558690) By way of preliminary send me by air mail your detailed refle ctions on what you expect me to do in London.
('53', 293, 3, 25, 558798) Copies of whatever you send by air mail should be sent through the usual weekly service.
('53', 293, 3, 26, 558887) How is Papa?

('53', 294, 2, 3, 559029) Unrevised ON THE FRONTIER DOWN MAIL, August 28, 1931
('53', 294, 3, 4, 559082) MY DEAR KUMARAPPA, Will you please look after the columns of Young India?
('53', 294, 3, 5, 559156) The idea is that there should be no change of name as editor.
('53', 294, 3, 6, 559218) I do not think the law requires such change during the temporary absence of the editor in charge.
('53', 294, 3, 7, 559316) But if such a change is required C. Rajagopala chari should appear as the editor, and in any case whenever you are in doubt or opinion among our own coterie differs, C. Rajagopalacharis should be the final voice when a reference is at all possible.
('53', 294, 3, 8, 559565) When such is not possible Jairamdass should be the final voice and when even that is not possible yours should be the final voice unless Kaka Saheb chooses to decide.
('53', 294, 3, 9, 559732) I do not want him to bear this burden.
('53', 294, 3, 10, 559771) But he has a right whenever he considers intervention necessary.
('53', 294, 3, 11, 559836) I have already written to Rajagopalachari to send something regularly and I am asking Jairamdas too to give you a weekly contribution or contri butions.
('53', 294, 3, 12, 559989) I have asked Jawaharlal also to do likewise and he is likely to send you a weekly budget of U.P. news as also anything else he may wish to write.
('53', 294, 3, 13, 560135) This therefore should not prove too great a strain on you.
('53', 294, 3, 14, 560194) But if all these fail as they may you will fill in the columns somehow or other.
('53', 294, 3, 15, 560275) Of course I expect to be able to send something every week.
('53', 294, 3, 16, 560335) In all your writings I would like you to make as little criticism as possible but give as many facts and figures as possible.
('53', 294, 3, 17, 560461) If you find time you can study the economics of drink and show by facts and figures what a tremendous waste the drink habit means apart from the actual money value of the drink consumed.
('53', 294, 3, 18, 560648) You may also take up the whole subject of economic waste that goes on in our midst through preventable disease, through wrong feeding, through the criminal waste of human excreta as manure.
('53', 294, 3, 19, 560838) This waste has been worked out by Poord.
('53', 294, 3, 20, 560879) I believe his works we have in the Ashram.
('53', 294, 3, 21, 560922) The double waste through wrong feeding has been very partially worked out by Col.
('53', 294, 3, 22, 561004) Macanisteror some such namethe medico who has written on vitamins.
('53', 294, 3, 23, 561071) I have simply thrown together a few hints that should be sufficient for you to make explorations and discoveries, Economics treated in this manner can really become fascinating, interesting and instructive for the masses.
('53', 294, 3, 24, 561293) Nor do these
('53', 295, 0, 1, 561306) 296 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 295, 1, 2, 561348) explorations require very deep or prolonged study for one like you who has studied the science of economics.
('53', 295, 1, 3, 561457) If you find that these are hints thrown out by a man who knows nothing about economics you are at liberty to brush aside the whole of this paragraph.
('53', 295, 1, 4, 561607) Please share this letter with Kaka Saheb.
('53', 295, 1, 5, 561649) I expect to be away not longer than 3 months at the outside and not less than six weeks in any event.

('53', 295, 6, 9, 561846) DEAR MR. EMERSON, Perhaps H. E. will show you my personal letter 1 to him.
('53', 295, 6, 10, 561921) This is to tell you how grieved I felt in Simla over what appeared to me to be your obstructive tactics.
('53', 295, 6, 11, 562026) I hope I am wrong in my fears and that you were not responsible for the exasperating situation that led to the waste of precious three days.
('53', 295, 6, 12, 562167) The securing of a constitution is nothing to me compared to the joy of discovering human contacts by which one could swear.
('53', 295, 6, 13, 562291) I shall soon forget the sad memories of the past three days and I know you will forgive me if I have unwittingly misjudged you.
('53', 295, 6, 14, 562419) But the future fills me with fear and misgivings.
('53', 295, 6, 15, 562469) If you will distrust Sardar Patel, Pandit Jawaharlal and Abdul Ghaffar Khan an explosion is almost unavoidable.
('53', 295, 6, 16, 562581) You will most certainly avoid it by trusting them.
('53', 295, 6, 17, 562632) I think I know the influence you have.
('53', 295, 6, 18, 562671) May I assume your promise to use it aright?
('53', 295, 6, 19, 562715) I have written thus freely in the exercise of a privilege of friendship and therefore hope not to be misunderstood.
('53', 295, 6, 20, 562831) My right hand needing rest, I have to write with the left hand.
('53', 295, 6, 21, 562895) I could not dictate a personal letter like this.

('53', 296, 3, 4, 563155) DEAR MR. EMERSON, I had no time to take a statement from Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan about Akbarpura and the treatment of prisoners whom, for want of a better distinguishing term, I describe as political.
('53', 296, 3, 5, 563356) The Khan Saheb gave me a harrowing description of the prisoners in the Peshawar jail who were convicted in connection with a drama about which you would remember we had a discussion.
('53', 296, 3, 6, 563539) Khan Saheb tells me that the prisoners are kept in irons and given the heavy work of turning the kharas.
('53', 296, 3, 7, 563644) I do not mind heavy work being given to able bodied men, but the ablest bodied men have also limits to their capacity for exertion and it is no joke to work a kharas with irons on ones legs.
('53', 296, 3, 8, 563835) I enclose herewith a statement made by Shrimati Khurshedbehn regarding what she saw of injured men and women in Akbarpura.
('53', 296, 3, 9, 563958) I would like you not to brush aside all these statements as false or exaggerated.
('53', 296, 3, 10, 564040) Her statement about Dara Ismail Khan which also I enclose herewith is worthy of attention.

('53', 296, 7, 14, 564228) ON THE FRONTIER DOWN MAIL, August 28, 1931 DEAR FRIEND, In the Frontier Province, as it appears to me from accounts received, a great deal of repression is going on.
('53', 296, 7, 15, 564394) Only recently in Akbarpura apparently without any justification several hundred men and women were charged by the military and received more or less serious injury.
('53', 296, 7, 16, 564559) In Dara Ismail Khan there was a Hindu Muslim riot and it is said that there was connivance on the part of the police.
('53', 296, 7, 17, 564677) Political prisoners are undergoing harsh treatment.
('53', 296, 7, 18, 564729) Khurshedbehn who will give you this letter knows something about all these things.
('53', 296, 7, 19, 564812) If you could go to the Frontier Province and quietly inquire into these
('53', 297, 0, 1, 564884) 298 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 297, 1, 2, 564926) events and report upon them, your report might be of inestimable value and might ease the situation.
('53', 297, 1, 3, 565027) Whether you should be authoritatively appointed by the Working Committee or not I do not know.
('53', 297, 1, 4, 565122) Such an appointment might conceivably defeat the end in view.
('53', 297, 1, 5, 565184) The Frontier Province is a non regulation province.
('53', 297, 1, 6, 565236) Many things are done there which in our part of India we would believe to be impossible.
('53', 297, 1, 7, 565325) The Government may even prohibit the inquiry and if an appointment made by the Working Committee is thwarted by the Government there might arise an undesirable situation.
('53', 297, 1, 8, 565496) But the first thing is whether you could spare the time to go to the Frontier Province, and if you could, whether you would like to take up this responsibility.
('53', 297, 1, 9, 565657) If you can, you will please confer with Sardar Vallabhbhai and then decide whether a quiet informal enquiry would be preferable to an enquiry authorized by the Working Committee.
('53', 297, 1, 10, 565836) You will not hesitate to say no if for any reason whatsoever you find that you cannot shoulder this burden.
('53', 297, 1, 11, 565944) Yours sincerely, SYT.

('53', 297, 5, 17, 566092) DEAR DR.
('53', 297, 5, 18, 566101) COMMISARIAT You will remember your having told me when we met at Naini Tal that you were ready to take up some national service for which you might consider yourself fitted.
('53', 297, 5, 19, 566275) I want to take you at your word.
('53', 297, 5, 20, 566308) You know Khurshedbehn Naoroji.
('53', 297, 5, 21, 566339) She has just taken up work amongst the women of the Frontier Province.
('53', 297, 5, 22, 566410) She tells me that if there was a lady doctor working amongst the women of this province, it would be a good thing which the Frontier people would appreciate.
('53', 297, 5, 23, 566568) If you have the time and the inclination, I think you are the person for this work.
('53', 297, 5, 24, 566652) If you are at all free and inclined to give your time for this work, please correspond with Miss Naoroji, whose address for the next ten days will be 78 Napean Sea Road, Bombay.
('53', 297, 5, 25, 566830) She expects to leave for the Frontier Province inside of a fortnight.

('53', 298, 2, 3, 567041) ON THE FRONTIER DOWN MAIL, August 28, 1931
('53', 298, 3, 4, 567084) MY DEAR MATHEW, I was glad to have had even that brief chat.
('53', 298, 3, 5, 567145) You must keep perfectly cheerful and calm.
('53', 298, 3, 6, 567188) You must shed your shyness and begin to speak Hindi freely, no matter how bad or ungrammatical it may be.
('53', 298, 3, 7, 567294) By the time I return I expect you to be able to talk fluently in Hindi and you must write also as often as you can.
('53', 298, 3, 8, 567410) This want of self confidence in you, an educationist, is a terrible drawback and you must get out of it.
('53', 298, 3, 9, 567515) An educationist is always a student.
('53', 298, 3, 10, 567552) Nothing is beyond him and he is never too old to learn a new thing if the learning of it is necessary for the task before him, and you have realized that a competent knowledge of Hindi is indispensable if you are to serve through the Ashram.
('53', 298, 3, 11, 567794) You should write to me.
('53', 298, 3, 12, 567818) If Ratilal is there try to befriend him.
('53', 298, 3, 13, 567859) A good educationist would delight in handling semi lunatics like Ratilal and by his moral force weaning them from their lunacy.
('53', 298, 3, 14, 567987) I do believe that Ratilal is not past praying for.
('53', 298, 3, 15, 568038) He is very responsive to any kind attention that might be given to him.
('53', 298, 3, 16, 568110) Being brainless he has no friends.
('53', 298, 3, 17, 568145) Nobody has taken a loving interest in him.
('53', 298, 3, 18, 568188) Hence he has felt neglected and the feeling of being neglected made him sour, angry and, in the end, mad.

('53', 298, 7, 22, 568369) NARANDAS, I got your two letters.
('53', 298, 7, 23, 568403) They give no news about Ratilal.
('53', 298, 7, 24, 568436) Send Mumbai Samachar to Prabhavati.
('53', 298, 7, 25, 568472) I have already sent a note to you about Lalji.
('53', 298, 7, 26, 568519) Send him goods worth up to Rs. 50 when Mama writes about them.
('53', 298, 7, 27, 568582) Deduct from that amount the sum of Rs. 20 which you have already sent.
('53', 298, 7, 28, 568653) That is, you have now to send Rs. 30. Three Yeravda wheels being manufactured in Bardoli are to be sent to Mama just now.
('53', 298, 7, 29, 568775) Nine more may be supplied later when he writes for them.

('53', 299, 1, 2, 568874) Now that I am going, I am leaving a heavy burden on you.
('53', 299, 1, 3, 568931) But you are capable of shouldering it.
('53', 299, 1, 4, 568970) Mahadev must have sent you my address.
('53', 299, 1, 5, 569009) Write to me from time to time.
('53', 299, 1, 6, 569040) I believe I shall return in six weeks at the shortest and twelve weeks at the longest.
('53', 299, 1, 7, 569127) It is nearly ten now.
('53', 299, 1, 8, 569149) I feel sleepy and, therefore, dont write more.
('53', 299, 2, 9, 569196) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] To the others I will write in the morning or from the ship.

('53', 299, 4, 11, 569325) 348. INTERVIEW TO THE BOMBAY CHRONICLE
('53', 299, 5, 12, 569364) ON THE FRONTIER DOWN MAIL, August 29, 1931
('53', 299, 6, 13, 569407) The very first question .
('53', 299, 6, 14, 569433) was as to whether his recent conversations with the Viceroy had been such as to convince him that there has been a change of heart on the part of the Government, Mahatmas decisive reply was: I am afraid not.
('53', 299, 7, 15, 569641) Q. What is your reply to your critics who suggest that you have not been consistent in your demand?
('53', 299, 7, 16, 569741) According to this section you started with a demand for an impartial inquiry into the breaches of the Truce by the Government, then you modified it to an inquiry by a High Court Judge, then you said you would be satisfied with a one sided inquiry, and, finally, you have agreed to no inquiry at all in places other than Bardoli.
('53', 299, 8, 17, 570070) A. The public are justified in thinking that I am inconsistent.
('53', 299, 8, 18, 570134) But I must be allowed to have the same right and to say that I am not inconsistent.
('53', 299, 8, 19, 570218) My insistence was on an inquiry.
('53', 299, 8, 20, 570251) I had suggested many things.
('53', 299, 8, 21, 570280) But the indispensable minimum was an open impartial inquiry into the Bardoli charge.
('53', 299, 8, 22, 570365) And that open inquiry has been granted.
('53', 299, 8, 23, 570405) Whether it will be also impartial or not I do not know.
('53', 299, 8, 24, 570461) Though I had put forth a claim to an inquiry into all the charges that claim is not withdrawn but if the Government do not grant or face an inquiry into other charges that could be no ground for refusing to proceed to London.
('53', 299, 8, 25, 570687) An enquiry is a substitute for civil disobedience.
('53', 299, 8, 26, 570738) That right has been specially reserved as you will see from the correspondence published.
('53', 299, 8, 27, 570828) In my opinion nothing of an essential character has been given up.
('53', 300, 0, 1, 570895) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 301
('53', 300, 1, 2, 570939) Q. In the Charge sheet published by you, you have given a catalogue of breaches of the Truce by the Government.
('53', 300, 1, 3, 571051) These have occurred in spite of your presence in the country and your strenuous efforts not to precipitate a crisis.
('53', 300, 1, 4, 571168) Do you expect the same Government to observe the terms of the Delhi Pact while you are away in London?
('53', 300, 2, 5, 571271) A. The fear underlying your question is not groundless.
('53', 300, 2, 6, 571327) Nevertheless as a man of trust I do expect the same Government to observe the terms of the Delhi Pact.
('53', 300, 2, 7, 571430) You will see in the communique 1
('53', 300, 3, 8, 571463) an unequivocal declaration on the part of the Central Government that they will secure observance of the Pact.
('53', 300, 3, 9, 571574) I have also the solemn assurance of the Viceroy himself but to what extent this declaration in the communique and the solemn assurance will be carried out into practice the future alone will show.
('53', 300, 3, 10, 571771) But in any event for a big national organization like the Congress no mans presence is indispensable however efficient he may be for service.
('53', 300, 3, 11, 571913) An organization that has weathered storms for an unbroken period of nearly fifty years is well able to take care of itself in spite of my absence and I really feel that the Government having sent me to London will make it a point of honour to see that the terms of the Truce are better observed now than before.
('53', 300, 4, 12, 572225) Q. Will you advise Congress organizations to resort to direct action if the Government continues the same policy and does not make amends for the injustice already done?
('53', 300, 4, 13, 572395) A. In the first place you should understand that the Congress has not abandoned any of the charges because the Congress will not get an inquiry into them.
('53', 300, 4, 14, 572550) Negotiations will still proceed and I have not a shadow of doubt that where any grievance is so felt as to make some action absolutely necessary the Congress will adopt it.
('53', 300, 5, 15, 572723) Q. The agrarian situation in the U.P. is becoming more and more acute.
('53', 300, 5, 16, 572794) It is reported that peasants are giving up cultivation of lands and migrating to the cities in search of employment.
('53', 300, 5, 17, 572911) The movement is spreading.
('53', 300, 5, 18, 572938) What remedy do you suggest to ease the situation and what part should the Congress play to secure a better atmosphere ?
('53', 300, 6, 19, 573058) A. I am painfully conscious of the ever worsening situation in the U.P. I had a very long chat with Pandit Jawaharlal over this situation on the train.
('53', 300, 6, 20, 573210) We have together mapped out a course of action and I have ventured to address a communication to Sir Malcolm

('53', 301, 1, 3, 573410) 1 He is one of the strongest Governors we have in India at the present moment.
('53', 301, 1, 4, 573489) And I know he could be strong in action for securing justice.
('53', 301, 1, 5, 573551) I do not despair of his coming to the help of the Congress to avert a crisis.
('53', 301, 2, 6, 573629) Q. Are you optimistic about the results of the Round Table Conference ?
('53', 301, 3, 7, 573701) A. No, if I am to judge the future from the present appearance.
('53', 301, 3, 8, 573765) But being a born optimist I have never lost hope even in the midst of impenetrable darkness.
('53', 301, 3, 9, 573858) But let us take care of the present.
('53', 301, 3, 10, 573895) Let every Congressman do his duty, observe non violence and truth in thought, word and deed and I promise that all will be well.
('53', 301, 4, 11, 574024) Q. What will be your minimum demand at the R.T.C.?
('53', 301, 5, 12, 574075) A. My minimum demand is happily chalked out by the Congress in the mandate given to me.
('53', 301, 5, 13, 574163) To be worthy of the confidence reposed in me I may be expected not to move away from the terms of the mandate by a hairs breadth.
('53', 301, 6, 14, 574293) Q. Will you reiterate your eleven points?
('53', 301, 7, 15, 574335) A. My eleven points are as dead as Queen Anne.
('53', 301, 7, 16, 574382) But they have revived in an invigorated form in the so called Fundamental Rights resolution 3 of the Congress.
('53', 301, 7, 17, 574493) Whatever of these is to be part of the Constitution will be part of any constitution acceptable to the Congress.
('53', 301, 8, 18, 574606) Q. Will you accept a Constitution which may fall short of the Karachi resolution for Independence, or as you put it Substance of Independence?
('53', 301, 9, 19, 574749) A. Nothing short of Substance of Independence will be acceptable to me personally, let alone Congress resolution.
('53', 301, 10, 20, 574863) Asked to state his attitude regarding the National Debt question, Gandhiji said that as ever his attitude was to demand an impartial tribunal to examine it.
('53', 301, 11, 21, 575020) The conversation then turned to the Congress formula for communal solution, 4
('53', 301, 12, 22, 575098) which was not acceptable to a section of Muslims.
('53', 301, 12, 23, 575148) Would Gandhiji accept a compro mise for the sake of presenting a united front at the Conference?
('53', 301, 13, 24, 575245) A. The Congress resolution has left me no room for accepting any compromise not acceptable to the parties concerned.
('53', 301, 13, 25, 575362) The unanimous consent was, therefore, necessary for any compromise.

('53', 302, 1, 2, 575664) Gandhiji deplored that this had been rendered foolishly impossible by excluding the official representation of the Nationalist Muslim opinion.
('53', 302, 1, 3, 575807) It may be hopeless minority or it may represent the largest section of enlightened Muslim opinion.
('53', 302, 1, 4, 575906) But whatever the extent of its influence it is not an opinion that can be summarily rejected not at least by me when I know that the Nationalist Muslim Party contains some of my oldest Mussalman comrades and noblest Muslims in all India.
('53', 302, 2, 5, 576144) Q. Have you agreed to visit Lancashire and to explain the character of the boycott movement?
('53', 302, 3, 6, 576237) A. Yes.
('53', 302, 3, 7, 576245) I have promised a visit if it is desired by Lancashire men.
('53', 302, 4, 8, 576305) Questioned whether he proposed to visit any other European country besides England, Gandhiji said: If I can possibly do so I would certainly respond to the invitations I have received from all over Europe.
('53', 302, 4, 9, 576511) But that will depend upon the movement of the political barometer.
('53', 302, 5, 10, 576578) The Mahatma informed that his London hostess was Miss Muriel Lester, who, like him, was a representative of paupers.
('53', 302, 6, 11, 576695) Q. If the R.T.C. concedes the national demand, do you propose to remain in political life?
('53', 302, 6, 12, 576786) Gandhiji smilingly said: If the R.T.C. concedes the National demand I shall only just enter political life.
('53', 302, 7, 13, 576894) Gandhiji was urged to give an exclusive message to the country through the Chronicle when he exclaimed.
('53', 302, 7, 14, 576998) I belong to the Chronicle.
('53', 302, 7, 15, 577025) Belonging as I do to the Chronicle, there can be no exclusive message to it from me.
('53', 302, 8, 16, 577110) Gandhiji could not be induced to say anything more and to a valley of questions put to him, he said: You have pumped everything out of me by your 17 points.
('53', 302, 8, 17, 577267) Now you must thank me and run away.

('53', 303, 2, 3, 577400) BOMBAY, August 29, 1931 DEAR FRIEND, At the end of our conversation at Simla, I opened the question of Dr. Ansaris delegation at the Round Table Conference and I wanted to mention the delegation on behalf of the Federated Chambers of Commerce.
('53', 303, 2, 4, 577644) As to Dr. Ansari, as you know, Lord Irwin believed that I should have carried the impression that his delegation would be a certainty.
('53', 303, 2, 5, 577779) As to the delegation on behalf of the Federated Chambers I have the correspondence between Lord Irwins Private Secretary and the Chairman of the Federation.
('53', 303, 2, 6, 577936) From this corres pondence it is clear that there were to be three representatives and the correspondence closed with the names being finally submitted by the Federation.
('53', 303, 2, 7, 578106) These were Sir Purushottamdas Thakurdas, Seth Jamal Mohammed and Seth Ghanshyam Das Birla.
('53', 303, 2, 8, 578197) Of these, only Sir Purushottamdas received the invitation and as you are aware, the Federation would not think of sending him without the other two also receiving the invitations.
('53', 303, 2, 9, 578377) Here I think the plighted word of an ex Viceroy is concerned and should, in my opinion, be respected.
('53', 303, 2, 10, 578479) But this is not the point that I wanted to urge.
('53', 303, 2, 11, 578528) The point that I wish to urge is that my usefulness would be largely curtailed if the interests represented by these three gentlemen and the interests represented by Dr. Ansari are not to be represented at the Round Table Conference.
('53', 303, 2, 12, 578762) The Federation is to a certain extent working in conjunction with the Congress and so is the Nationalist Muslim Party of which Dr. Ansari is the head.
('53', 303, 2, 13, 578913) If there were any negotiations in connection with Hindu Muslim question or in connection with Indian Commerce I should be perfectly helpless without the assistance and co operation of these gentlemen and the very purpose for which I am being sent to London is in danger of being defeated.
('53', 303, 2, 14, 579202) I would therefore ask you, if you have authority, to consider the advisability of these nominations from the standpoint I have suggested.
('53', 303, 2, 15, 579340) If you have not, I would like you to telegraph the purport of this to the Prime Minister and if it is at all possible repair what seems to me to be a glaring omission.
('53', 303, 2, 16, 579508) I may add that Pandit Malaviya and Mrs. Sarojini Naidu also are associating themselves with the contents of this letter.

('53', 304, 3, 4, 579825) DEAR FRIENDS, I thank you for your address which I must confess I have not been able to read.
('53', 304, 3, 5, 579919) I shall certainly carefully read it, but I can give you this assurance in anticipation that as a representative of the Congress, the interests of the Christian community will be just as dear to me as those of every other community.
('53', 304, 3, 6, 580151) I hope that all the Christian friends, men and women, will carry out the Congress programme personally as you know there are many things that both men and women can easily do.
('53', 304, 3, 7, 580327) For instance, spin in the name of the poor every day, adopt khadi to the exclusion of every other cloth, and those who are given to the drink habit can abstain from drink.

('53', 304, 5, 9, 580556) 351. SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, BOMBAY
('53', 304, 6, 10, 580594) August 29, 1931
('53', 304, 7, 11, 580610) Speaking from the balcony of a private house Mr. Gandhi addressed a huge enthusiastic crowd (who stood in drenching rain) for quarter of an hour.
('53', 304, 8, 12, 580756) Mr. Gandhi said he had signed the Second Agreement with the Government.
('53', 304, 8, 13, 580828) They could read it.
('53', 304, 8, 14, 580848) Some of them could ask what this man had gone and done again.
('53', 304, 8, 15, 580910) But Mr. Gandhi himself was aware that the nation had shown enormous trust in him by electing him as the sole delegate to the Round Table Conference.
('53', 304, 8, 16, 581059) In ordinary circumstances, but for their trust he would have refused to go to London, but their trust would support him.
('53', 304, 8, 17, 581180) He knew full well his own shortcomings and weaknesses, but truth and non violence would be his guiding principles and he hoped they would come out in their fullness in his work in London.
('53', 304, 8, 18, 581368) I am a cripple, but it is only natural that a crippled nation should have a crippled delegate who alone can understand the difficulties and miseries of the millions.
('53', 304, 9, 19, 581534) Mr. Gandhi assured his bearers that he would abide by the Congress mandate.

('53', 305, 1, 3, 581749) If I deceive you, even to kill me would not be violence.
('53', 305, 1, 4, 581806) I have no enmity with Englishmen, nor with Mohammedans, nor for the matter of that with anyone else.

('53', 305, 3, 7, 581965) S.S. RAJPUTANA, August 29, 1931 Though I see nothing on the horizon to warrant hope, being a born optimist, I am hoping against hope.
('53', 305, 3, 8, 582099) My faith is in God and He seems to have made my way clear for me to go to London.
('53', 305, 3, 9, 582181) Therefore I expect He will use me as His instrument for the service of humanity.
('53', 305, 3, 10, 582262) For me service of India is identical with the service of humanity.
('53', 305, 3, 11, 582329) Though Congress may be repudiated by sections of the people of India, it aims at representing the whole of India and, therefore, to deserve the trust that had been reposed in me and imposed upon me, I shall endeavour to represent every interest that does not conflict with the interests of the dumb millions for whom the Congress predom inantly exists.
('53', 305, 3, 12, 582682) I hope that Provincial Governments, the Civil Service and English mercantile houses will help the Congress to realize the mission it has set before itself.
('53', 305, 3, 13, 582838) Representing, as the Congress does, the message of non violence and truth, it can only succeed by the goodwill of all component parts of the nation and I am therefore hoping that goodwill will be extended to the humble representative that is going upon his errand.

('53', 306, 3, 4, 583279) With reference to the revenue collections in Bardoli and Borsad it was from the very beginning a clear understanding that the Khate dars affected by the civil disobedience were to pay only as much as they could without borrowing.
('53', 306, 3, 5, 583509) This was repeatedly brought out in the conversations between the Collector Mr. Perry of Kaira and his successor Mr. Bhadrapur and Mr. Kothawalla, Collector of Surat.

('53', 308, 3, 6, 586253) In our future swaraj women should have the same property rights as men.
('53', 308, 3, 7, 586325) What will actually happen neither I nor anyone else can say.

('53', 311, 5, 7, 590857) ADEN, September 3, 1931 I shall strive for a constitution which will release India from all thraldom and patronage, and give her, if need be, the right to sin.
('53', 311, 5, 8, 591017) I shall work for an India in which the poorest shall feel that it is their country in whose making they have an effective voice; an India in which there shall be no high class and low class of people; an India in which all communities shall live in perfect harmony.
('53', 311, 5, 9, 591283) There can be no room in such an India for the curse of untouchability or the curse of intoxicating drinks and drugs.
('53', 311, 5, 10, 591400) Women will enjoy the same rights as men.

('53', 312, 1, 2, 592179) 364. SPEECH AT RECEPTION, ADEN 1
('53', 312, 2, 3, 592212) September 3, 1931 I thank you for the honour you have done me.
('53', 312, 2, 4, 592275) I know that the honour is not meant for me personally or for my friends.
('53', 312, 2, 5, 592348) It is an honour done to the Congress whom I hope to be able to represent at the Round Table Conference.
('53', 312, 2, 6, 592452) I came to know that there was a hitch in your proceedings on account of the national flag.
('53', 312, 2, 7, 592543) Now it is inconceivable for me to find a meeting of Indians, especially where national leaders are invited, without the national flag flying there.
('53', 312, 2, 8, 592691) You know that many people sustained lathi blows and some have lost their lives in defending the honour of the flag, and you cannot honour an Indian leader without honouring the Indian national flag.
('53', 312, 2, 9, 592890) Again there is a Settlement between the Government and the Congress, which is no loger a hostile party but a friendly party.
('53', 312, 2, 10, 593015) It is not enough therefore to tolerate or permit the Congress flag, but it must be given the place of honour where Congress representatives are invited.
('53', 312, 2, 11, 593168) On behalf of the Congress, I give you the assurance that the Congress does not stand merely for isolated independence, which may easily become a menace to the world.
('53', 312, 2, 12, 593334) But the Congress, with its creed of truth and non violence, cannot possibly be a menace to the world.
('53', 312, 2, 13, 593436) It is my conviction that India numbering one fifth of the human race, becoming free through non violence and truth, can be a great force of service to the whole of mankind.
('53', 312, 2, 14, 593609) On the contrary India having no voice in her affairs is today a menace.
('53', 312, 2, 15, 593681) It is a helpless India exciting the jealousy and greed of other countries which must live by exploiting her.
('53', 312, 2, 16, 593790) But when India refuses to be exploited and is well able to take care of herself, and achieves that freedom through non violence and truth, she will be a force for peace and make for peaceful atmosphere in this troubled globe of ours.
('53', 312, 2, 17, 594024) It was therefore natural that the Arabs and others joined the Indians in organizing this function.
('53', 312, 2, 18, 594123) All who desire peace must join together to perpetuate peace.
('53', 312, 2, 19, 594184) This great peninsula, the birth place of

('53', 313, 0, 1, 594562) 314 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 313, 1, 2, 594604) Mahomed and of Islam, can help to solve the Hindu Muslim problem.
('53', 313, 1, 3, 594670) It is a matter of shame to me to confess that we are a house divided against itself.
('53', 313, 1, 4, 594755) We fly at each others throats in cowardice and fear.
('53', 313, 1, 5, 594808) The Hindu distrusts the Mussalman through cowardice and fear, and the Mussalman distrusts the Hindu through equal cowardice and imaginary fears.
('53', 313, 1, 6, 594953) Islam throughout history has stood for matchless bravery and peace.
('53', 313, 1, 7, 595021) It can therefore be no matter for pride to the Mussalmans that they should fear the Hindus.
('53', 313, 1, 8, 595113) Similarly it can be no matter for pride to the Hindus that they should fear Mussalmans, even if they are aided by the Mussalmans of the world.
('53', 313, 1, 9, 595256) Are we so fallen that we should be afraid of our own shadows?
('53', 313, 1, 10, 595318) You will be surprised to hear that the Pathans are living in peace with us.
('53', 313, 1, 11, 595394) They stood side by side with us in the last struggle, and sacrified their young men on the altar of liberty.
('53', 313, 1, 12, 595503) I want you, who belong to the country of the Prophets birth, to make your contribution to the restoration of peace between Hindus and Muslims in India.
('53', 313, 1, 13, 595655) I cannot tell you how you are to do it, but I may remind you that where there is a will there is a way.
('53', 313, 1, 14, 595759) I want the Arabs of Arabia to come to our rescue and help to bring about a condition of things when the Mussalman will consider it a point of honour to help the Hindu and vice versa.
('53', 313, 1, 15, 595942) For the rest, I would also give you the message of spinning and weaving in your homes.
('53', 313, 1, 16, 596029) Some of the Caliphs led lives which were models of simplicity, and if you help yourself by making your own cloth, there is in it nothing derogatory to Islam.
('53', 313, 1, 17, 596187) There is also the problem of drink which for you should be twice cursed.
('53', 313, 1, 18, 596260) There should be not a drop here, but as there are other communities too, I think the Arabs will have to persuade them to make Aden dry.
('53', 313, 1, 19, 596396) I do hope our relations with one another will now grow richer and closer.

('53', 314, 10, 13, 597079) Provided the Conference does not break down at the start over fundamentals, Mahatma Gandhi expects the session to last until the 1st November.
('53', 314, 10, 14, 597222) His first duty upon arriving in London, Mahatma Gandhi said, would be to confer informally with Mr. MacDonald, Mr. Baldwin, Lord Sankey, Viscount Peel, Lord Reading and others and tell them frankly what the Congress demands are.

('53', 316, 3, 7, 599139) I shall be in England maybe two weeks, or at the most two months.
('53', 316, 3, 8, 599205) That time will pass quickly.

('53', 316, 7, 16, 599670) S.S. RAJPUTANA, [September 5, 1931] 2
('53', 316, 8, 17, 599708) Prayer has been the saving of my life.
('53', 316, 8, 18, 599747) Without it I should have been a lunatic long ago.
('53', 316, 8, 19, 599797) My autobiography will tell you that I have had my fair share of the bitterest public and private experiences.
('53', 316, 8, 20, 599907) They threw me into temporary despair, but if I was able to get rid of it, it was because of prayer.
('53', 316, 8, 21, 600007) Now I may tell you that prayer has not been part of my life in the sense that truth has been.
('53', 316, 8, 22, 600101) It came out of sheer
('53', 316, 9, 23, 600122) 1 This is extracted from Mahadev Desais account in which he reports: The morning prayers are too early to attract these friends, but practically all Indians (who number over 40),Hindus, Mussalmans, Parsis, Sikhs,and a sprinkling of Europeans attend the evening prayers.
('53', 316, 9, 24, 600392) At the request of some of these friends a fifteen minutes talk after prayer and before dinner has become a daily feature.
('53', 316, 9, 25, 600514) A question is asked each evening, and Gandhiji replies to it the next.
('53', 316, 9, 26, 600585) One of the Indian passengersa Mussalman youth asked Gandhiji to give his personal testimony on prayer, not a theoretical discourse but a narration of what he had felt and experienced as a result of prayer. 2 From Diayke Panne by G. D. Birla
('53', 317, 0, 1, 600826) 318 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 317, 1, 2, 600868) necessity, as I found myself in a plight when I could not possibly be happy without it.
('53', 317, 1, 3, 600956) And the more my faith in God increased, the more irresistible became the yearning for prayer.
('53', 317, 1, 4, 601050) Life seemed to be dull and vacant without it.
('53', 317, 1, 5, 601096) I had attended the Christian service in South Africa, but it had failed to grip me.
('53', 317, 1, 6, 601180) I could not join them in prayer.
('53', 317, 1, 7, 601213) They supplicated God, but I could not do so, I failed egregiously.
('53', 317, 1, 8, 601280) I started with disbelief in God and prayer, and until at a late stage in life I did not feel anything like a void in life.
('53', 317, 1, 9, 601403) But at that stage I felt that as food was indispensable for the body, so was prayer indispensable for the soul.
('53', 317, 1, 10, 601515) In fact food for the body is not so necessary as prayer for the soul.
('53', 317, 1, 11, 601585) For starvation is often necessary in order to keep the body in health, but there is no such thing as prayer starvation.
('53', 317, 1, 12, 601705) You cannot possibly have a surfeit of prayer.
('53', 317, 1, 13, 601751) Three of the greatest teachers of the worldBuddha, Jesus, Mahomedhave left unimpeachable testimony that they found illumination through prayer and could not possibly live without it.
('53', 317, 1, 14, 601934) But to come nearer home.
('53', 317, 1, 15, 601959) Millions of Hindus and Mussalmans and Christians find their only solace in life in prayer.
('53', 317, 1, 16, 602050) Either you vote them down as liars or self deluded people.
('53', 317, 1, 17, 602109) Well, then, I will say, that this lying has a charm for me, a truth seeker, if it is lying that has given me that mainstay or staff of life, without which I could not bear to live for a moment.
('53', 317, 1, 18, 602303) In spite of despair staring me in the face on the political horizon, I have never lost my peace.
('53', 317, 1, 19, 602400) In fact I have found people who envy my peace.
('53', 317, 1, 20, 602447) That peace, I tell you, comes from prayer.
('53', 317, 1, 21, 602490) I am not a man of learning but I humbly claim to be a man of prayer.
('53', 317, 1, 22, 602559) I am indifferent as to the form.
('53', 317, 1, 23, 602592) Everyone is a law unto himself in that respect.
('53', 317, 1, 24, 602640) But there are some well marked roads, and it is safe to walk along the beaten tracks, trod by the ancient teachers.
('53', 317, 1, 25, 602756) Well, I have given my practical testimony.
('53', 317, 1, 26, 602799) Let everyone try and find that as a result of daily prayer he adds something new to his life, something with which nothing can be compared.

('53', 319, 10, 17, 604832) As his followers you can do nothing less than establish unity.
('53', 319, 10, 18, 604895) Upon Indias unity and independence, the peace of the rest of the world indirectly depends, but there can be no real international peace so long as India remains fettered by a foreign power.

('53', 320, 2, 3, 605188) [S.S. RAJPUTANA, September 6, 1931] Conditions in India are good so far as the strength of civil disobedience is concerned, but they are truly deplorable so far as Hindu Muslim unity is concerned.
('53', 320, 2, 4, 605385) Hitherto all effort at reconciliation has failed and we sorely need the goodwill of the whole world and especially of Mussalmans.
('53', 320, 2, 5, 605515) They can by sheer strength of friendliness shame both the communities into coming to agreement.
('53', 320, 2, 6, 605611) My expectations of the Conference are zero if I am to base them on a survey of the horizon.
('53', 320, 2, 7, 605703) But being an optimist I am hoping that something will turn up to make the conference a success from the national Indian standpoint.
('53', 320, 2, 8, 605835) In the event of failure there can be only one consequencerevival of civil disobedience and suffering for the people of a much bitterer type than last year.
('53', 320, 2, 9, 605991) The Congress is prepared to pay the cost whatever it may be for gaining freedom.
('53', 320, 2, 10, 606072) My message to the Nationalists of Egypt is: Like us you are an ancient people.
('53', 320, 2, 11, 606151) I hope you will not slavishly copy all that is Western.
('53', 320, 2, 12, 606207) If I have understood the events of your country correctly real freedom for Egypt has still to come and I feel sure that if you can appreciate and assimilate the method of non violence and truth in matters political, you will surely reach your goal much quicker than by any other method I know.
('53', 320, 2, 13, 606501) And if I may humbly put it I would like to say that Egypt will come to her own much more quickly if India gains true deliverance in the course of the next twelve months.
('53', 320, 2, 14, 606671) It is my firm belief that if India gains her freedom through non violence and truth it will mean a great deal to the whole world certainly to all the Eastern nations.

('53', 320, 4, 16, 606867) 1 This was issued in writing to a representative of Al Ahram in response to five questions sent to Gandhiji by the Editor in advance.

('53', 321, 3, 4, 607389) Working his spinning wheel all the time, Mr. Gandhi said he had enjoyed the voyage.
('53', 321, 3, 5, 607473) He did not appear to be sanguine as to the success of the Round Table Conference.
('53', 321, 3, 6, 607555) He said: On the horizon I see nothing but impenetrable darkness.
('53', 321, 3, 7, 607620) Gods ways are inscrutable.
('53', 321, 3, 8, 607647) I am an optimist.

('53', 321, 4, 10, 607729) He was most indignant at Shaukat Alis statement that he was compelled to part from Gandhi, because he only aimed at communal objects, the subjugation of the Moslems to the Hindus.
('53', 321, 4, 11, 607909) He declared: My whole life is a steady testimony against such an accusation.
('53', 321, 4, 12, 607986) There is no trace of communalism in me.
('53', 321, 4, 13, 608026) I would be a party to no settlement subjugating any community to another in India.
('53', 321, 5, 14, 608109) The Mahatma, who is still clothed only in a loin cloth, said he did not fear the alteration in temperature awaiting him in England.
('53', 321, 5, 15, 608241) He would make additions to his apparel if necessary, in the shape of a woollen cloth twisted round his body, and a jacket, but he would not change his diet.
('53', 321, 6, 16, 608398) The co operation of East and West, he remarked, would be a strong means to establish world peace, provided it was not based on brute force.
('53', 321, 7, 17, 608538) Mr. Gandhi was also assailed by Egyptian journalists who endeavoured to draw him out on various questions of general interest to the Orient but directly affecting Egypt.
('53', 321, 7, 18, 608708) To the question: What is your advice to the peoples of the Near and Middle East in their struggle for independence? he earnestly replied: They should conduct the struggle on absolutely non violent lines.
('53', 321, 7, 19, 608912) If they so do, they gain their end far quicker than in any other way.

('53', 322, 1, 2, 609056) 379. SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING
('53', 322, 2, 3, 609086) S.S. RAJPUTANA, [September 6, 1931] 1
('53', 322, 3, 4, 609124) Well, it is beyond my power to induce in you a belief in God.
('53', 322, 4, 5, 609186) There are certain things which are self proved, and certain which are not proved at all.
('53', 322, 4, 6, 609275) The existence of God is like a geometrical axiom.
('53', 322, 4, 7, 609325) It may be beyond our heart grasp.
('53', 322, 4, 8, 609359) I shall not talk of an intellectual grasp.
('53', 322, 4, 9, 609402) Intellectual attempts are more or less failures, as a rational explanation cannot give you the faith in a living God.
('53', 322, 4, 10, 609520) For it is a thing beyond the grasp of reason.
('53', 322, 4, 11, 609566) It transcends reason.
('53', 322, 4, 12, 609588) There are numerous phenomena from which you can reason out the existence of God, but I shall not insult your intelligence by offering you a rational explanation of that type.
('53', 322, 4, 13, 609763) I would have you brush aside all rational explanations and begin with a simple childlike faith in God.
('53', 322, 4, 14, 609866) If I exist, God exists.
('53', 322, 4, 15, 609890) With me it is a necessity of my being as it is with millions.
('53', 322, 4, 16, 609952) They may not be able to talk about it, but from their life you can see that it is part of their life.
('53', 322, 4, 17, 610054) I am only asking you to restore the belief that has been undermined.
('53', 322, 4, 18, 610123) In order to do so, you have to unlearn a lot of literature that dazzles your intelligence and throws you off your feet.
('53', 322, 4, 19, 610243) Start with the faith which is also a token of humility and an admission that we know nothing, that we are less than atoms in this universe.
('53', 322, 4, 20, 610383) We are less than atoms, I say, because the atom obeys the law of its being, whereas we in the insolence of our ignorance deny the law of nature.
('53', 322, 4, 21, 610528) But I have no argument to address to those who have no faith.
('53', 322, 4, 22, 610590) Once you accept the existence of God, the necessity for prayer is inescapable.
('53', 322, 4, 23, 610669) Let us not make the astounding claim that our whole life is a prayer, and therefore we need not sit down at a particular hour to pray.
('53', 322, 4, 24, 610804) Even men who were all their time in tune with the Infinite did not make such a claim.
('53', 322, 4, 25, 610890) Their lives were a continuous prayer, and yet for our sake, let us say they offered prayer at set hours, and renewed each day the oath of loyalty to God.
('53', 322, 4, 26, 611044) God of course never
('53', 322, 5, 27, 611064) 1 According to Mahadev Desai this was the second discourse and was delivered the next evening; vide footnote 1, Speech at Public Meeting, 5 12 1931 2 The question asked by the youth was: But, Sir, whilst you start with belief in God, we start with unbelief.
('53', 322, 5, 28, 611322) How are we to pray?
('53', 323, 0, 1, 611342) 324 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 323, 1, 2, 611384) insists on the oath, but we must renew our pledge every day, and I assure you we shall then be free from every imaginable misery in life.

('53', 326, 2, 3, 616614) EN ROUTE TO ENGLAND, September 7, 1931 I have always been a hero worshipper of Malaviyaji Maharaj and how can such a worshipper express his homage?
('53', 326, 2, 4, 616762) Whatever words he may write would seem inadequate to him.
('53', 326, 2, 5, 616820) My first sight of him was through a photograph in 1890. It appeared in the journal India brought out in England by Mr. Digby.
('53', 326, 2, 6, 616946) Believe me, the same image is before my eyes even today.
('53', 326, 2, 7, 617003) As in his dress so in his thoughts, a continuity has been preserved and this is based on his charm and devotion.
('53', 326, 2, 8, 617116) Who today can match Malaviyajis patriotism which has had an uninterrupted flow from his youth down to this day?
('53', 326, 2, 9, 617228) The Banaras Hindu University is his life breath and he in turn is the life of the Banaras Hindu University.

('53', 327, 2, 3, 617989) S.S. RAJPUTANA, September 8, 1931 Mr. Roys death 2 is a painful shock to me.
('53', 327, 2, 4, 618066) Indian journalism has suffered a grievous loss.

('53', 327, 5, 8, 618256) S.S. RAJPUTANA, September 8, 1931 If the meeting 3 is held on Monday I shall be placed in a most embarrassing position.
('53', 327, 5, 9, 618376) Monday is my day of silence, and when I took my vow of silence I made three exceptions.
('53', 327, 5, 10, 618464) Whether a meeting of this character is covered by one of them is debatable; I am, however, hoping and praying that I shall not be obliged to reach a final decision, but that a way out of the difficulty will be found.
('53', 327, 6, 11, 618681) Asked to specify the exceptions Gandhiji said: The first is if I am in distress and can only be assisted by speaking; the second if somebody else is in distress who can be helped by my speaking, and the third if exceptional circumstances prevail, such as an unexpected call from the Viceroy or other high official who must be seen in the interest of the cause.
('53', 327, 6, 12, 619042) Thus my appearance at the committee on Monday can only come under the third exception, but only by a considerable stretch of meaning, seeing that it is not a sudden unexpected call.
('53', 327, 6, 13, 619224) In such circumstances people have generously accommodated me.
('53', 327, 6, 14, 619286) What can happen in London I dont know.
('53', 327, 7, 15, 619325) Gandhiji pointed out that since he must hold himself in readiness for private conferences with two of the highest Government officials on Sunday, he could not anticipate the period of silence, nor postpone it until Tuesday, because the Commit tee would be sitting all the week.

('53', 329, 2, 3, 621281) [On or after September 9, 1931] 1
('53', 329, 3, 4, 621315) DELIGHTED MEET MERCHANTS 6.40 SATURDAY MORNING.
('53', 329, 4, 5, 621363) From a photostat: S.N. 17674
('53', 329, 5, 6, 621392) 394. A FICKLE FRIEND
('53', 329, 6, 7, 621413) [Before September 11, 1931] 2
('53', 329, 7, 8, 621443) Thus writes an English friend who has known me for years:
('53', 329, 8, 9, 621501) No one has for some time told you quite bluntly, and in good English, that you are making an unmitigated fool of yourself, and out of personal vanity and the desire to act the dictator, are descending to lies and subterfuges which even ordinary men, who lay no claim to special sanctity, do not indulge in.
('53', 329, 9, 10, 621808) You know full well, that the main reason for your not attending the Round Table Conference is due to your inability to solve the Hindu Muslim question, and that you have used petty matters as an excuse.
('53', 329, 9, 11, 622011) Your Congress Committee man at Allahabad, Mr. Sundarlal, has publicly made this statement, and you know full well the text of your motion, moved at the Working Committee meeting, when you were turned down by your Committee.
('53', 329, 9, 12, 622235) You admitted in that resolution the failure of Hindu Muslim negotiations and your inability to put forward any political proposals at the Round Table Conference, and that you would confine yourself solely to work for the amelioration of the condition of the masses.
('53', 329, 10, 13, 622501) You, who prate of worshipping at the altar of truth, the same altar that I worship at, are by half truths, cunning words and deliberate deception trying to force the blame of your deliberate pre arranged determination not to go to the Round Table Conference on the Government.
('53', 329, 11, 14, 622778) When, as you now boldly declare, sedition is the creed of Congress and the overthrow of this Government its objectives, are you not, with calculated
('53', 329, 12, 15, 622927) 1 The telegram was in reply to the following message received on September 9, 1931: Indian Merchants Association anxious meet yourself and party while passing through Paris and respectfully request wire time of arrival. 2 This and the following three articles were written on board the ship.

('53', 330, 1, 2, 623308) deliberation, forcing the Government to take action?
('53', 330, 1, 3, 623361) You may throw dust successfully in the eyes of your followers, but at least you do know that you cannot deceive His eyes.
('53', 330, 1, 4, 623483) Go and introspect.
('53', 330, 1, 5, 623502) Call on that inner voice honestly, not as Gandhi the politician, who, without the political guidance of Pandit Motilal Nehru, is making a fool of himself, and forcing events towards an upheaval which will benefit nobody but goondas, but to the other Gandhi, whom millions, and I include myself in that list, respect for his creed of love and the splendid work he is doing for the depressed classes.
('53', 330, 1, 6, 623901) That Gandhi is overpowered.
('53', 330, 1, 7, 623929) Your personal pride and autocratic spirit has vanquished the other Gandhi.
('53', 330, 2, 8, 624004) I want, every European wants, to see India politically free, and the
('53', 330, 3, 9, 624073) Round Table Conference is the constitutional means for that purpose.
('53', 330, 4, 10, 624142) however, deliberately seek her freedom through blood, because your pride
('53', 330, 5, 11, 624215) received an enormous shock when you found that the Conference would go on
('53', 330, 6, 12, 624289) without you, though you will call it passive resistance and other names.
('53', 330, 7, 13, 624362) cannot evade these facts.
('53', 330, 8, 14, 624388) Go, I beg of you, and introspect, and after purification come to the altar
('53', 330, 9, 15, 624463) of truth.
('53', 330, 9, 16, 624473) In order that I may not miss his wrath through any mishap, he registered the letter.
('53', 330, 9, 17, 624558) The letter could be handed to me only on board.
('53', 330, 9, 18, 624606) The best answer to the letter is that I am writing this on the steamer that is taking me to London.
('53', 330, 9, 19, 624706) Indeed I might have suppressed the letter.
('53', 330, 9, 20, 624749) But I did not, as it is typical of many I have received in the course of my life.
('53', 330, 9, 21, 624831) When I do something that pleases them, my English friends issue embarrassing certificates.
('53', 330, 9, 22, 624922) And when I do something that displeases them, forgetful of what they said in the past, they swear at me.
('53', 330, 9, 23, 625027) They will not stop to inquire of me why they see an inconsistency between my past conduct and the present.
('53', 330, 9, 24, 625134) They will not have the patience to discover the perfect harmony between two seemingly inconsistent acts.
('53', 330, 9, 25, 625239) When I find such friends, I distrust their praise and its disinterestedness, and hence remain unaffected by their censure.
('53', 330, 9, 26, 625362) Take the writer of the foregoing elegant censure.
('53', 330, 9, 27, 625412) Only a few months ago, I was a good man.
('53', 330, 9, 28, 625453) Now suddenly I have become all that is bad, even a liar, because he suspects that I would not go to London because of my failure to bring about Hindu Muslim unity.
('53', 330, 9, 29, 625617) He will not even condescend to ask me for an explanation, and believes a garbled report of my speech at the last A.I.C.C. meeting.
('53', 330, 9, 30, 625748) Let him and the public know, that I hold in my bag a wire from Pandit Sundarlal, saying that he never made the remark attributed to him.
('53', 330, 9, 31, 625885) But I suggest
('53', 331, 0, 1, 625899) 332 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 331, 1, 2, 625941) that even if Pandit Sundarlal did make the remark attributed to him, that would be no basis for a friend to found an accusation against me.
('53', 331, 1, 3, 626081) A friendship, that cannot bear the slightest strain and would believe any rumour or report against a friend is not worth much, if anything.
('53', 331, 1, 4, 626221) Let those English friends who have sent me wires or letters of congratulations, be warned against rushing to unjust judgments, the moment they hear reports about my doings which may displease them.
('53', 331, 1, 5, 626419) The reports need not always be false, as was the case in the present instance.
('53', 331, 1, 6, 626498) If the common purpose is well understood, friendships formed to advance that purpose should weather all storms of misunderstandings, misreportings and the like.
('53', 331, 1, 7, 626659) I will therefore state the purpose.
('53', 331, 1, 8, 626695) It is complete freedom from the alien yoke in every sense of the term, and this for the sake of the dumb millions.
('53', 331, 1, 9, 626810) Every interest therefore, that is hostile to their interest, must be revised, or must subside if it is not capable of revision.
('53', 331, 1, 10, 626938) This freedom does not, need not, exclude partnership with the English on terms of absolute equality and terminable at the will of either party.
('53', 331, 1, 11, 627082) Those Englishmen, who sincerely desire the immediate consummation of such an event, will never need to repent of their having issued to me a certificate of merit.
('53', 331, 1, 12, 627245) The others will see nothing but evil in my most innocent acts.

('53', 331, 3, 15, 627351) [Before September 11, 1931] Dr. Yudhvirsinh has been, on his own responsibility, issuing at Delhi a weekly Urdu edition of Navajivan containing his selections from both Navajivan and Young India.
('53', 331, 3, 16, 627547) He assures me, that the Urdu edition will be conducted strictly along the lines of Young India and Navajivan.
('53', 331, 3, 17, 627657) It will accordingly take no advertisements, and will publish only such material as appears in the two weeklies.
('53', 331, 3, 18, 627769) The annual subscription is only three rupees.
('53', 331, 3, 19, 627815) I am glad of this enterprise.
('53', 331, 3, 20, 627845) I have always felt that Urdu knowing people should know the message of these weeklies.
('53', 331, 3, 21, 627932) I congratulate Dr. Yudhvirsinh on his patriotic effort.
('53', 331, 3, 22, 627988) I hope he will be encouraged by the Urdu knowing public.
('53', 331, 3, 23, 628045) The address is Urdu Navajivan, Chandni Chawk, Delhi.

('53', 332, 1, 2, 628165) 396. THE OTHER SIDE
('53', 332, 2, 3, 628185) [Before September 11, 1931] Under the above mentioned heading a correspondent has written a long letter, protesting against my condemnation, of the attempt made by a student of the Fergusson College on the life of the Acting Governor of Bombay.
('53', 332, 2, 4, 628430) I give below a very much condensed summary of the letter:
('53', 332, 3, 5, 628488) I was extremely pained to read your note in the last issue of Navajivan under the heading madness (gandpan).
('53', 332, 3, 6, 628597) I must at the very outset make it clear, that I have been a non violent non co operator since 1921, and accept the Congress creed of non violence by faith as farthest as possible, and as a policy in exceptional circumstances alone, such as the molestation of the honour of women or of the National Flag.
('53', 332, 3, 7, 628901) True non violence is possible even in the most provoking circumstances as long as these two are not in actual danger.
('53', 332, 3, 8, 629019) But whenever women are molested or the National Flag is dishonoured, I fear my non violence will melt away, and if it does not, it would be so not out of any merit in me, but on most occasions owing to the weakness of the flesh, and on exceptional occasions only, on account of studious self restraint.
('53', 332, 3, 9, 629322) I was, if I can say so with modesty, the first to start the idea of offering civil disobedience to the Martial Law at Sholapur and suffer imprisonment after actual disobedience.
('53', 332, 3, 10, 629500) This much by way of personal explanation.
('53', 332, 4, 11, 629542) It is, in my opinion, no use denouncing one who is almost in the jaws of death.
('53', 332, 4, 12, 629622) He deserves pity if anything.
('53', 332, 4, 13, 629652) Violence in action is a merit or demerit, which can neither prosper by mere public praise however great, as it is a question of life and death; nor can it be wiped out by the strongest public denunciation or by Government repression, or by both, as it is the outcome of rebelling emotions.
('53', 332, 4, 14, 629942) Those who fear not the gallows will not be daunted by public opinion.
('53', 332, 4, 15, 630012) Virtue or vice, it is exceptional, bursting out only after severest repression or molestation of women; it can be wiped out permanently, only if the rulers mend their ways or end themselves.
('53', 332, 5, 16, 630203) We may justly wish to remain safe and unhurt till doomsday, only if we are virtuous and sin fearing; but what right have we, after committing the most heinous of sins, to feel pain for treachery practised against us?
('53', 332, 5, 17, 630420) And especially when we have blocked all open, honest, honourable, untreacherous ways of revenge?
('53', 332, 5, 18, 630517) The glory of no country however great, not even of India, lies in meekly suffering injustice, zulum and beastly atrocities.
('53', 332, 5, 19, 630641) Nothing is unfair in love and war is a general maxim, and it is the truer, in the case of unequal
('53', 333, 0, 1, 630739) 334 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 333, 1, 2, 630781) parties, for the weaker.
('53', 333, 2, 3, 630806) Now the philosophy of hosts and guests.
('53', 333, 2, 4, 630846) Whose guest was Mr. Hot son?
('53', 333, 2, 5, 630875) Of the Fergusson College?
('53', 333, 2, 6, 630901) Surely of the Principal, and professors too; but never of the unwilling students.
('53', 333, 2, 7, 630983) Were the students consulted before inviting such a worthy guest?
('53', 333, 2, 8, 631048) Was not the Prince of Wales too a guest of the Indian Government and consequently, by the same argument, of India?
('53', 333, 2, 9, 631163) But how was he welcomed?
('53', 333, 2, 10, 631188) Sri Gogate in this case therefore is the last to be blamed for not having extraordinary self restraint; the real responsibility or irresponsibility is of Sri Mahajani, and the real offender or rather the real instigator of the offence is the Acting Governor, who ought to be advised to behave better.
('53', 333, 3, 11, 631489) I appreciate the courageous presence of mind shown by the Acting Governor, as well as the extraordinary coolness with which just after the unsuccessful outrage he told Sri Gogate, That was a foolish thing to do, my boy, and inquired, What made you do a thing like that? But this generous and seemingly affectionate mood of the Acting Governor was very short lived.
('53', 333, 3, 12, 631854) Had it been courageously preserved by him a little longer, leaving Sri Gogate to himself as if nothing unusual had happened, what a dramatic effect it would have produced on the revolutionary mentality in the country!
('53', 333, 3, 13, 632072) The Acting Governor, always under the protection of his A.D.C. and the military guards, need not fear foolish things done by stray Gogates.
('53', 333, 3, 14, 632212) The time is not yet gone.
('53', 333, 3, 15, 632238) Trust begets trust.
('53', 333, 3, 16, 632258) Forgiveness melts bitterest enmity.
('53', 333, 3, 17, 632294) But the forgiveness must be of the strong, never of the weak.
('53', 333, 3, 18, 632356) The Acting Governor is the right man to make a beginning in this direction.
('53', 333, 3, 19, 632432) But the signs of the times clearly show there is very little chance that good sense will prevail.
('53', 333, 3, 20, 632530) As this note is being written on board the s.s.
('53', 333, 3, 21, 632578) Rajputana, it will therefore be printed three weeks after it is written.
('53', 333, 3, 22, 632651) The subject matter being unfortunately an evergreen, the note need not be considered stale.
('53', 333, 3, 23, 632743) It is very much to be feared, that the correspondent represents a mentality prevailing amongst many students.
('53', 333, 3, 24, 632853) But the attitude is all the more poisonous and harmful, because it is honestly held.
('53', 333, 3, 25, 632938) It is contrary to experience to say, as the correspondent says, that emotional youth will act on the spur of the moment irrespective of the atmosphere surrounding them.
('53', 333, 3, 26, 633107) There is no doubt about their reckless bearing, but I refuse to believe that they are so devoid of pride as to be wholly indifferent to praise or blame.
('53', 333, 3, 27, 633260) I am quite certain that if they knew that their acts would be universally condemned, they would never throw away their precious lives.
('53', 333, 3, 28, 633395) I have no doubt therefore in my mind that it is the duty of everyone who realizes the immense wrong done to the
('53', 334, 0, 1, 633507) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 335
('53', 334, 1, 2, 633551) cause by such deeds to condemn them unequivocally.
('53', 334, 1, 3, 633602) It is altogether misleading to hold the Acting Governor responsible either for the Sholapur Martial Law or the acts done under it.
('53', 334, 1, 4, 633733) It is the system that is at fault.
('53', 334, 1, 5, 633768) The Congress therefore having realized the central fact is trying to assassinate the system, and not the helpless administrators.
('53', 334, 1, 6, 633898) Even if an angel was put to administer the system based upon the exploitation of a vast country like India by a powerful corporation, that angel would plead helplessness, and on due occasions do exactly what the Acting Governor did.
('53', 334, 1, 7, 634131) The ten headed Ravana was no human monster, but it was the system personified in Ravana, who had new heads popping up as soon as the old ones were cut off.
('53', 334, 1, 8, 634287) It was only when Ramas attention was drawn to the root from which the heads sprang up, that he was able effectively to deal with Ravana.
('53', 334, 1, 9, 634424) We have had many assassinations, and in the place of each official assassinated another has been posted, and the system has gone on as merrily as ever.
('53', 334, 1, 10, 634576) But if we once succeed in dealing with the root of the mischief, we shall have no more repetitions of Sholapur and the distasteful hangings.
('53', 334, 1, 11, 634717) So far therefore as the condemnation of the many wrongs which rankle in the youthful breasts is concerned, I would be just as strong as they are in condemning them.
('53', 334, 1, 12, 634882) Let them leave aside all specious reasoning, and join hands with the Congress in destroying the system.
('53', 334, 1, 13, 634986) The way of assassination of persons gives it a new lease of life.
('53', 334, 1, 14, 635052) The war of non violence shortens its life and if it can be completely assimilated, it ensures complete eradication of the system.
('53', 334, 1, 15, 635182) Let those who argue like the correspondent remember that the cult of assassination, if it is not checked in its progress, will recoil on our own heads, and our last state may be worse than the first.
('53', 334, 1, 16, 635382) Let us not run the very grave danger of reviving the system under a new garb.
('53', 334, 1, 17, 635460) The same system administered by brown men instead of white men will work the same havoc as now, if not infinitely greater.

('53', 334, 3, 19, 635606) 397. LEST WE DELUDE OURSELVES
('53', 334, 4, 20, 635636) [Before September 11, 1931] As I get nearer England I find my hopes of meeting with any success there receding.
('53', 334, 4, 21, 635748) I cannot point to any particular reason for this.
('53', 334, 4, 22, 635798) I place before readers the thoughts that arise in my mind.
('53', 334, 4, 23, 635857) I feel ashamed when I think on the one hand, of what the world expects of
('53', 335, 0, 1, 635931) 336 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 335, 1, 2, 635973) India and on the other compare our resources with those expectations.
('53', 335, 1, 3, 636043) I met an educated Arab at Aden.
('53', 335, 1, 4, 636075) He it was who had read out the welcome address in Arabic.
('53', 335, 1, 5, 636133) He said: Our hopes are pinned upon youon your non violent struggle. These are his very words, We have been watching you.
('53', 335, 1, 6, 636254) May you triumph. Similar cables have been sent from Egypt by the Muslim journalists there.
('53', 335, 1, 7, 636345) I believe that as we proceed, we shall hear such utterances from the people of Europe also.
('53', 335, 1, 8, 636437) Perhaps the world would not have looked to India the way it is looking now, if we had been waging our war of independence by means of physical force.
('53', 335, 1, 9, 636587) It means that the world is weary of hypocrisy and of rivers of blood.
('53', 335, 1, 10, 636657) Wherever it casts its eyes, it finds falsehood and, though it participates in it, it has come to abhor it.
('53', 335, 1, 11, 636764) And it is for this reason that it accepts Indias claim to truth and non violence and derives consolation from this and desires that India may triumph, that is, become independent with the help of these two weapons.
('53', 335, 1, 12, 636979) How can this expectation be fulfilled?
('53', 335, 1, 13, 637018) While closing this mail, I think of Gujarat, ignoring the other parts of India.
('53', 335, 1, 14, 637098) Gujarat has a leader like Vallabhbhai; Gujarat is the headquarters of satyagraha; nowhere also are as many volunteers working as in Gujarat; everyone, even the Government, agrees that Gujarat has made a sizable contribution to the struggle.
('53', 335, 1, 15, 637339) However, can Gujarat be regarded as having passed the test of truth and non violence one hundred per cent?
('53', 335, 1, 16, 637446) Are the volunteers of Gujarat, both men and women, totally free from greed, malice, anger, fear, fraud, and so on?
('53', 335, 1, 17, 637561) Khadi is a mighty external symbol of non violence.
('53', 335, 1, 18, 637612) Are Congressmen in Gujarat always clad in khadi from head to foot?
('53', 335, 1, 19, 637679) Do they do sacrificial spinning every day for the sake of the poor?
('53', 335, 1, 20, 637747) Has Gujarat succeeded in boycotting untouchability, liquor and foreign cloth?
('53', 335, 1, 21, 637825) These too are external symbols of collective non violence.
('53', 335, 1, 22, 637884) These and similar questions keep coming up in my mind and I feel agitated.
('53', 335, 1, 23, 637959) On the one hand, I make the claim that the country has accepted truth and non violencethere are strong grounds for the claimon the other, while reflecting on it I also find that this claim does not contain the whole truth.
('53', 335, 1, 24, 638182) I cannot claim that we have properly accepted all that I now regard as the characteristics of truth and non violence.
('53', 335, 1, 25, 638300) Being an optimist, I keep on piloting my boat in the hope that we shall somehow make up for our feelings.
('53', 335, 1, 26, 638406) But I must proclaim that underlying all my expectations is my faith in Gujarat.
('53', 335, 1, 27, 638486) If Gujarat fulfils my expectations, the rest of India will then follow suit and, if India does so, despite the despondency that may

('53', 336, 11, 13, 639146) Unless the Government changes the day for the meeting of the Federal Structure Committee next week, Mr. Gandhi will sit throughout the discussion on Monday listening but saying nothing, Monday being his day of silence, but on Tuesday he will be prepared to present his views.
('53', 336, 11, 14, 639422) During the sittings of the Committee of the Round Table Conference he will speak extemporaneously, relying on the circumstances of the moment for inspiration.
('53', 336, 11, 15, 639581) In an interview today he said: I have prepared no plans, no speeches, no arguments and no programme for my stay in England.
('53', 336, 11, 16, 639705) I shall do everything on the spur of the moment, depending upon my inner voice.
('53', 336, 11, 17, 639785) If England realizes the strength of the nationalist movement I expect she will heed our demands, but if unhappily she thinks we are in a minority, then I must be prepared to return to India to renew the fight.

('53', 337, 4, 6, 640426) I am pessimistic.
('53', 337, 4, 7, 640444) But I am also optimistic.
('53', 337, 4, 8, 640470) The facts, as I saw them when I left India, made me pessimistic.
('53', 337, 4, 9, 640535) Nor do I know of anything that has happened since to change my judgment.
('53', 337, 4, 10, 640608) But, in spite of appearances, my faith makes me optimistic, as I have always been an optimist!
('53', 337, 5, 11, 640703) How far, I asked him, have you a free hand to negotiate? I am boundabsolutelyby the Karachi Congress resolution.
('53', 337, 5, 12, 640816) But within that boundary I am free.
('53', 337, 5, 13, 640852) The Karachi resolutions demand control by India of finance, the army and foreign relations subject to safeguards demonstrably in the interests of India but also gave the delegation rather loose power to make adjustments necessary in the interests of India.
('53', 337, 5, 14, 641109) If I am satisfied in principles, if we are agreed in principle that is the bedrockthen adjustments can be made.
('53', 337, 5, 15, 641221) I shall, at first opportunity, make my positionthe conditions of my mandateplain to the conference.
('53', 337, 5, 16, 641321) Then it will become clear whether on that basis we can hopefully discuss details.
('53', 337, 5, 17, 641403) If it seems that we cangood.
('53', 337, 5, 18, 641432) If not, I shall have failed in my mission and I must return to India.
('53', 337, 6, 19, 641502) And then? I asked.
('53', 337, 6, 20, 641521) The face grew grave.
('53', 337, 6, 21, 641542) The calm eyes looked into the
('53', 337, 7, 22, 641572) distance.
('53', 337, 7, 23, 641582) Then probably civil disobedience must come again.
('53', 337, 7, 24, 641632) But that is not a threat that if I fail in London civil disobedience will at once be proclaimed in India.
('53', 337, 7, 25, 641738) I do not want to embarrass the Government.
('53', 337, 7, 26, 641781) People in England do not believe that.
('53', 337, 7, 27, 641820) That is because they do not understand.
('53', 337, 7, 28, 641860) It is not we that embarrass the Government.
('53', 337, 7, 29, 641904) It is the situation that has been created, the wrong that has been done in the past that causes the embarrassment It is inevitable.
('53', 337, 7, 30, 642036) It is always so when a wrong that has been done has to be righted.

('53', 338, 4, 11, 642566) Asked by the Customs Inspector whether he had anything to declare, Gandhiji replied: I am a poor mendicant.
('53', 338, 4, 12, 642674) All my earthly possessions consist of: six spinning wheels; prison dishes; a can of goats milk; six homes pun loin cloths; one towel; and my reputation, which cannot be worth much.
('53', 338, 5, 13, 642855) The Inspector pursued, Have you any cigarettes, cigars, alcohol, firearms or narcotics ? Oh, no, I never smoke, never drink, nor indulge in drugs.
('53', 338, 5, 14, 643002) Besides, being an advocate of non violence, I never carry fire arms.

('53', 338, 8, 18, 643165) Mahatma Gandhi has no intention of visiting the United States because he believes he is not wanted there, he said in an interview with The New York Times when he landed here.
('53', 338, 9, 19, 643340) He explained that he refused to contemplate such a visit unless and until he could feel certain that Americans would receive him as the spokesman for Indias cause and not as a social curiosity.
('53', 338, 9, 20, 643534) His American friends had told him, he added that this was not now possible.
('53', 338, 10, 21, 643610) [In reply to another question he said:] To climatic conditions I am indifferent.
('53', 338, 10, 22, 643691) If the political weather is favourable, I will go anywhere where I am needed.
('53', 338, 10, 23, 643769) I am afraid there is no hope for India at the Round Table

('53', 339, 1, 2, 643869) Conference as far as external appearances are concerned.
('53', 339, 1, 3, 643926) But, as an irrepressible optimist, I hope against hope that something will turn up which will alter the aspect of the horizon.
('53', 339, 1, 4, 644053) But since such a hope is only based on faith, not on reason, it may prove illusory.
('53', 339, 1, 5, 644137) I have come to London with neither a programme nor propo sals.
('53', 339, 1, 6, 644200) I have simply accepted the invitation of the British Government, and I am ready to place myself at their disposal, to answer questions and to give them all the information within my power.
('53', 339, 1, 7, 644389) I have come expecting to remain in London only two weeks, but I am ready, if necessary, to remain two months.
('53', 339, 1, 8, 644499) The only engagement I have made is in the nature of a pilgrimage.
('53', 339, 1, 9, 644565) I have promised to visit my friend, Romain Rolland, the celebrated French writer, who is lying sick at his home near Territet, Switzerland, and whose sister, Madeleine Rolland, was among the old friends who greeted me on my arrival at Marseilles.
('53', 339, 2, 10, 644812) Asked if he believed the recent change in the Government of Great Britain would change the British policy toward India, Mr. Gandhi said unhesitatingly: No.
('53', 339, 2, 11, 644968) Besides, the new Government has already given me assurances it will carry out the policy of its predecessor, as far as the India Conference is concerned.
('53', 339, 3, 12, 645122) With regard to the critical Hindu Muslim differences, however .
('53', 339, 3, 13, 645186) the Mahatma admitted: I fear the Hindu Muslim question has now become almost insoluble for reasons on which I dont wish to enlarge.
('53', 339, 3, 14, 645318) But I am still not without hope that a solution may be found.
('53', 339, 3, 15, 645380) It is open to the Muslims to block the way to a settlement of the future of India as it is equally open to the British Government to make their opposition an excuse for not granting India self government.
('53', 339, 3, 16, 645585) But if the British Government is in earnest in its desire to make a friendly settlement with India it should not take shelter behind the Muslims.
('53', 339, 4, 17, 645731) I asked Mr. Gandhi if he was fully satisfied that Muslims and other racial or religious minorities would receive justice under a swaraj home rule government, mainly Hindu, as it would be if appointed on a population basis.
('53', 339, 5, 18, 645954) He replied that the claims of the minorities must receive the fullest satisfac tion in any future settlement.
('53', 339, 5, 19, 646064) He himself, he recalled, had frequently urged his fellow Hindus to accept all the Muslim claims, partly on sentimental grounds and partly because he was convinced some of them were unrealizable in practice.
('53', 339, 5, 20, 646271) But he said emphatically that Muslim opinion must be conciliated and satisfied before swaraj
('53', 340, 0, 1, 646364) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 341
('53', 340, 1, 2, 646408) was possible.
('53', 340, 1, 3, 646422) He confessed, however, that he did not know in the present state of confusion and unrest how this was to be effected.
('53', 340, 2, 4, 646540) I then challenged Mr. Gandhi to explain apparent inconsistencies in his attitude regarding the 60,000,000 out cast Hindu untouchables, certain of his statements concerning this grave problem having provoked much criticism from his friends, both in India and in America.
('53', 340, 3, 5, 646810) Mr. Gandhi said with the greatest earnestness: Believe me, my attitude on the question of untouchability has never wavered in the slightest degree.
('53', 340, 3, 6, 646958) My position regarding the untouchables is unanswerable.
('53', 340, 3, 7, 647014) Before my critics were born I defended the rights of the untouchables.
('53', 340, 3, 8, 647085) The misunderstanding which arose regarding my attitude was apparently due to the fact that I rebuked the leaders of untouchables deputation which interviewed me early last year.
('53', 340, 3, 9, 647263) But I am always rebuking someone, and usually my dearest friends.
('53', 340, 3, 10, 647329) What I told this deputation was that I refused to declare publicly that the untouchable classes must be made a reserved subject in any home rule settlement.
('53', 340, 3, 11, 647486) I refused because I did not believe it possible.
('53', 340, 3, 12, 647535) Nor do I today.
('53', 340, 3, 13, 647551) But I believe sincerely that no swaraj government could exist for twenty four hours which continued to uphold the principle of untouchability.
('53', 340, 3, 14, 647694) No untouchable need fear that his interests under swaraj will be neglected, as they are neglected now.
('53', 340, 3, 15, 647797) At the present moment the untouchables cannot be protected by the British Government, since the British cannot afford to offend the various interests interested in maintaining untouchability.
('53', 340, 3, 16, 647989) But a real Indian government would not be forced to surrender to these interests, for it would have a much greater interest to servethat of national unity.
('53', 340, 3, 17, 648145) I reaffirm my statement that Indias national existence will stand or fall on the question of the untouchables.

('53', 341, 9, 20, 649894) Mr. Gandhi told the Associated Press today that he believed the British Government was faced with such staggering domestic problems that it was not likely to refuse Indias demands for self government.
('53', 341, 10, 21, 650095) Refusal would mean the renewal of the civil disobedience campaign, he said, and the boycott of British goods on a scale greater than ever before.
('53', 341, 10, 22, 650241) He promised that he would not take such a step until every possibility for arbitration had been exhausted.
('53', 341, 10, 23, 650348) He said:

('53', 342, 1, 3, 650525) It will mean, I fear, that not only Indians would be shot down but Britishers would be killed.
('53', 342, 1, 4, 650620) You cannot hold 360,000,000 people without liberty in the leashes of non violence forever.
('53', 342, 2, 5, 650711) If England is wise, she will weigh carefully the present strength and potentiality of the Nationalist movement and hearken to the appeal of that vast sub continent for independence.
('53', 342, 2, 6, 650893) She should not deny others the gift which she cherishes most herself.
('53', 342, 2, 7, 650963) He emphasized that any safeguard proposed by England must be demonstrably in the interests of India as well, saying: We must have complete financial and fiscal autonomy.
('53', 342, 2, 8, 651133) We must have an effective dominion status, but that does not exclude Indias partnership in or alliance with the Empire.

('53', 343, 3, 9, 652654) September 11, 1931
('53', 343, 4, 10, 652673) In conversation with Reuters correspondent who had accompanied him from India, the Mahatma predicted that if the Round Table Conference did not break down for the first fortnight over the differences of opinion on fundamentals, the conclave might last until November 15th.
('53', 343, 5, 11, 652946) In answer to a question whether he intended to press England to bear a share of the huge debt incurred by the British Government in India .
('53', 343, 5, 12, 653086) Mr. Gandhi replied: There is no question of pressing England to admit anything, but whatever cannot be agreed to in the matter of taking over debts should be referred to arbitration.
('53', 343, 6, 13, 653269) Mr. Gandhi stated that a swaraj government would more than make up for a loss in revenue from alcohol and from the land by reducing the present ruinous expenditure for the army, the Civil Service salaries, etc.
('53', 343, 7, 14, 653480) Asked what his programme was, he replied: How should I know?
('53', 343, 7, 15, 653541) You have seen the Congress mandate.
('53', 343, 7, 16, 653577) That is my programme.
('53', 343, 8, 17, 653599) Asked to look up for the photographers, the Mahatma said: I never look at photographs.
('53', 343, 8, 18, 653686) I am not at your disposal and am now going to my cabin.

('53', 344, 2, 3, 653870) September 11, 1931
('53', 344, 3, 4, 653889) Since I visited France as a student to see the Exhibition at Paris in 1890 2, some greater and more permanent links between you and me have been formed.
('53', 344, 3, 5, 654042) The forger of those links is your own distinguished countryman Romain Rolland who constituted himself an interpreter of the humble message that I have been trying to deliver to my countrymen for the last 30 years or more.
('53', 344, 3, 6, 654264) I have learnt something of the traditions of your country and of the teachings of Rousseau and Victor Hugo and on my entering upon my missionvery difficult mission in Londonit heartens me to find a welcome from you fellow students.
('53', 344, 4, 7, 654496) And as he expounded the message of non violence to the youths belonging to
('53', 344, 5, 8, 654571) a martial race, as he explained that non violence is no weapon of the weak but of the
('53', 344, 6, 9, 654657) strongest and that strength does not mean mere strength of muscle, and that to a
('53', 344, 7, 10, 654738) non violent man possession of the muscle is not a necessity but possession of a
('53', 344, 8, 11, 654818) strong heart is an absolute necessity, they cheered him most enthusiastically He
('53', 344, 9, 12, 654899) explained by taking the example of the muscular Zulu quaking before a European child
('53', 344, 10, 13, 654984) holding a revolver in his hand and contrasting him with the women of India who
('53', 344, 11, 14, 655063) stood lathi blows and lathi charges without quaking.
('53', 344, 11, 15, 655116) To kill and to be killed in
('53', 344, 12, 16, 655144) fighting an enemy is, comparatively speaking, an act of bravery but to stand the
('53', 344, 13, 17, 655225) blows of your adversaries and not to retaliate is a greater form of bravery, and that is
('53', 344, 14, 18, 655314) precisely what India has been training herself for.
('53', 344, 14, 19, 655366) He concluded by touching on
('53', 344, 15, 20, 655394) another aspect of the same question.
('53', 344, 15, 21, 655431) This struggle through non violence has been otherwise described as a process of purification, the underlying idea being that a nation loses its liberty owing to some of its own weaknesses and we find that immediately we shed our weaknesses, we regain our liberty.
('53', 344, 15, 22, 655695) No people on earth can be finally subjected without their co operation
('53', 344, 16, 23, 655766) 1 The meeting was organized by the Association of the present and past students of Marseilles to honour the spiritual ambassador of India.
('53', 344, 16, 24, 655905) The report has been extracted from Mahadev Desais London Letter.

('53', 345, 1, 2, 656037) voluntary or involuntary.
('53', 345, 1, 3, 656063) It is involuntary co operation when for fear of some physical hurt you submit yourself to a tyrant or a despot.
('53', 345, 1, 4, 656175) In my wanderings among the students I made the discovery at an early stage of the movement that in order to conduct a movement of this kind character must be the foundation.
('53', 345, 1, 5, 656349) We also found that real education consists not in packing the brain with so many facts and figures, not in passing examinations by reading numerous books but in developing character.
('53', 345, 1, 6, 656532) I do not know to what extent you students of France lay stress upon character rather than upon intellectual studies, but I can say this that if you explore the possibilities of non violence you will find that without character it will prove a profitless study.
('53', 345, 1, 7, 656793) I hope that the meeting will not be the beginning and end of our acquaintance.
('53', 345, 1, 8, 656872) I hope that this acquaintance will be the beginning of a living contact between you and my countrymen.
('53', 345, 1, 9, 656975) In a movement, such as we are conducting in India, we need the intellectual sympathy of the whole world, and if after a careful study of the movement and means employed by us to attain our freedom you feel that we deserve your sympathy and support I hope you will not fail to extend that sympathy.

('53', 346, 2, 3, 657381) September 12, 1931
('53', 346, 3, 4, 657400) It was raining heavily, Gandhi shrugged his shoulders under the rough spun cloth, and said: I do not like rain.
('53', 346, 3, 5, 657512) I have just heard that you have had no summer here this year.
('53', 346, 3, 6, 657574) I can put up with that if I can bring peace to India.
('53', 346, 3, 7, 657628) I want to give a message to the world through the Evening Standard: 2
('53', 346, 4, 8, 657698) If India gains her freedom through truth and non violence, I feel convinced it will be the largest contribution of the age to the peace of the world.
('53', 346, 4, 9, 657848) M. K. GANDHI What I want is peace for India.
('53', 346, 4, 10, 657893) I want the people of Britain to help me.
('53', 346, 4, 11, 657934) I do not want to embarrass the Government, I want to help them.
('53', 346, 4, 12, 657998) Why do I come here?
('53', 346, 4, 13, 658018) Because I have given my word of honour to Lord Irwin.
('53', 346, 4, 14, 658072) No man ever lost anything by keeping his word of honour.
('53', 346, 4, 15, 658129) I have kept mine.
('53', 346, 4, 16, 658147) What do I mean by peace?
('53', 346, 4, 17, 658172) The dictionary will tell you it is the opposite of war.
('53', 346, 4, 18, 658228) We have had enough turbulence and strife in India.
('53', 346, 4, 19, 658279) Now we want peace.
('53', 346, 4, 20, 658298) I have been described as a messenger without a mandate.
('53', 346, 4, 21, 658354) That is sheer inaccuracy.
('53', 346, 4, 22, 658380) I have the mandate of the Indian people.
('53', 346, 5, 23, 658421) Gandhi then handed me a typewritten sheet and pointed to the last paragraph which reads: "The Congress appoints and authorizes Mahatma Gandhi to represent it." Is that a mandate?
('53', 346, 5, 24, 658600) I say it is.
('53', 346, 5, 25, 658613) Why do I spin, you ask?
('53', 346, 5, 26, 658637) It is a great exercise in patience.
('53', 346, 5, 27, 658673) When your wife gets angry, just spin.
('53', 346, 5, 28, 658711) You ask me if I shall break my vow of silence on Monday.
('53', 346, 5, 29, 658768) 3 I shall do so if necessary.
('53', 346, 5, 30, 658798) I am anxious to keep my vow, but if they insist I shall speak.
('53', 346, 6, 31, 658861) Gandhi told me that he would wear his loin cloth in London, but would protect
('53', 346, 7, 32, 658939) 1 The interview was given on the boat while Gandhiji was crossing the Channel.
('53', 346, 7, 33, 659018) 2 This was a written message.
('53', 346, 7, 34, 659048) 3 The Federal Structure Committee of the Round Table Conference was to meet on the 14th, which was a Monday.

('53', 347, 1, 3, 659246) He would not attend any theatres.
('53', 347, 1, 4, 659280) At one time I used to attend the Lyceum.
('53', 347, 1, 5, 659321) I liked Shakespeares playsI adored the incomparable Ellen TerryI worshipped her, but that was before the advent of melodrama.
('53', 347, 1, 6, 659447) The only reason I will not attend theatres in London is because I shall not have time.
('53', 347, 1, 7, 659534) I am not the dreadful old man I am represented to be.
('53', 347, 1, 8, 659588) Actually I am a very jolly fellow.
('53', 347, 1, 9, 659623) I could almost be described as Scotch.
('53', 347, 1, 10, 659662) I am very careful of my sixpences.
('53', 347, 1, 11, 659697) I last stood on the shores of England on August 6, 1914, just after the outbreak of War.

('53', 347, 3, 15, 659887) September 12, 1931 You will not this evening expect me to take up much of your time, or to say much with reference to my mission , but I wish to say one thing in a general way.
('53', 347, 3, 16, 660064) I am here with my friends on a mission of peace.
('53', 347, 3, 17, 660113) I am, and my friends are, guests of the great English nation.
('53', 347, 3, 18, 660175) I hope that by the time we have finished our work, you will not consider that we have in any way abused your hospitality.
('53', 347, 3, 19, 660297) I hope that, as the days go by, you will understand the scope of the mission on which the Congress has sent me.
('53', 347, 3, 20, 660409) You will also please know that, as an agent holding a power of attorney from the Congress, I shall have my limitations.
('53', 347, 3, 21, 660529) I have to conduct myself within the four corners of the mandate that I have received from the Congress.
('53', 347, 3, 22, 660633) There are some words in that mandate which give to me a little measure of freedom of action, but in all respects, in all fundamental respects, I am hidebound 2. I may not, if I am to be loyal to the trust reposed in me walk outside the four corners of that mandate.
('53', 347, 4, 23, 660899) 1 According to Reuter, Gandhiji arrived in London from Folkstone at 4.10 in the afternoon and though it was raining , the rush of people was so great that police precautions became necessary.
('53', 347, 4, 24, 661091) He was driven straight to Friends House at Euston Road .
('53', 347, 4, 25, 661148) Lawrence Housman, welcoming him on behalf of the reception committee, said: .
('53', 347, 4, 26, 661226) Mahatma Gandhi, if I may say so, you are a strange manto the people of your own country and more so to my people .
('53', 347, 4, 27, 661341) You are so sincere that you make some of us suspicious.
('53', 347, 4, 28, 661397) You are so simple that you bewilder some of us.
('53', 347, 4, 29, 661445) . 2 Reuters report, published in The Bombay Chronicle, 14 9 1931, The Tribune, 15 9 1931, and The Hindustan Times, 16 9 1931, has here instead: Gandhiji emphasized that he must conduct himself within the Congress mandate, some words of which left him little freedom, but in all other respects and in all fundamental respects, he was unbound.
('53', 348, 0, 1, 661787) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 349
('53', 348, 1, 2, 661831) I venture to feel that Congress stands for a good cause, of which any nation would be proud.
('53', 348, 1, 3, 661924) The Congress wants freedom unadult erated for the dumb and starving millions.
('53', 348, 1, 4, 662002) In order that Congress may represent them, the Congress has chosen, as its means of vindicating this freedom, truth and non violence.
('53', 348, 1, 5, 662136) I am fully aware that not all Congressmen have lived up to the means, and I know that we of the Congress shall deserve the curses of the whole world if, in the name of truth and non violence, we do the contrary.
('53', 348, 1, 6, 662348) But I derive the greatest consolation from the knowledge that I possess that the best workers of the Congress today represent truth and non violence in their essence.
('53', 348, 1, 7, 662515) We have in our midst, I know, a school of violence also.
('53', 348, 1, 8, 662572) I know many of these young menI have lived with them, I have mixed with them, I have talked to them also.
('53', 348, 1, 9, 662678) I have endeavoured, as several others of my co workers have endeavoured, to win them from what we hold is an error; but, at the same time, I know that there is a common cause, even between them and ourselves.
('53', 348, 1, 10, 662887) They are burning to attain the freedom to which India is entitled, which is Indias birthright.
('53', 348, 1, 11, 662982) I repeat what I have told them in public and in privatethat their activities embarrass Congress, their activities set back the hands of the clock of progress.
('53', 348, 1, 12, 663141) The Congressmen who are wedded to this creed realize fully that these young men, who resort to violence for the sake of gaining freedom, do harm not only to themselves but to the country, and most of all to the dumb millions to whom I have referred.
('53', 348, 1, 13, 663391) We may be nationalists, we may be ardent patriots, but immedia tely we apply these means of truth and non violence, our patriotism be comes internationalism.
('53', 348, 1, 14, 663549) Our patriotism is so conceived that we want our freedom not to injure the freedom of any other country or of any single individual.
('53', 348, 1, 15, 663681) We believe not in the law that might is right, or the greatest good of the greatest number, but we believe in the greatest good of all, including the meanest of creatures amongst all Gods creation.
('53', 348, 1, 16, 663879) And if India could vindicate her freedom, attain it through these means, do you not think that it would be well, not only with India, but with the whole world?
('53', 348, 2, 17, 664039) But there is something more.
('53', 348, 2, 18, 664068) There is the Settlement between the Government of India and the Congress.
('53', 348, 2, 19, 664142) That is a sacred thing arrived at through the strivings of that noble Englishman, Lord Irwin.
('53', 348, 3, 20, 664236) 1 The foregoing is taken from The Indian News.

('53', 349, 1, 2, 664374) I had repeatedly promised him, if it was humanly possible, that I would come to London and, as soon as I felt the way was open, I have dashed to London .
('53', 349, 2, 3, 664528) Recommending the study of the Indian question, Mr. Gandhi realized the difficulty, because the British were rightly preoccupied with home affairs but, [he said:] I wish it were possible for Englishmen and women to realize that the budget will not be honestly balanced, unless the balance between Britain and India is set right .
('53', 349, 3, 4, 664857) Concluding Mr.Gandhi asked the audience to work for the fulfilment of his mission , for it would be for the good not only of India but of the world.

('53', 349, 13, 15, 665347) Mr. Gandhi, in an interview, gave me the essence of the Congress mandate which he will present.
('53', 349, 13, 16, 665443) It lays down:
('53', 349, 14, 17, 665457) 1. The Congress goal is complete independence.
('53', 349, 15, 18, 665504) 2. This means control over the army, external affairs, finance, and economic policy.
('53', 349, 16, 19, 665589) 3. Scrutiny by an impartial tribunal of the financial transactions of the British Government.
('53', 349, 17, 20, 665683) 1 Gandhiji must have sent this telegram shortly after he arrived in London.
('53', 350, 0, 1, 665759) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 351
('53', 350, 1, 2, 665803) There were words, he said, which gave him a small measure of freedom of action, but otherwise he was bound to the four corners of the mandate.
('53', 350, 2, 3, 665946) Mr Gandhi also said that, baffling though it was, he would never despair of arriving at some workable solution of the Hindu Muslim question.
('53', 350, 3, 4, 666087) Mr. Gandhi said that he would never despair of arriving at a workable solution.
('53', 350, 3, 5, 666167) He was always optimistic.
('53', 350, 3, 6, 666193) He was prepared to go the whole hog with the Muslims without the slightest reservation.
('53', 350, 3, 7, 666281) He would sign a blank paper and leave the Muslims to write in what they considered the truth, and he would then fight for it.
('53', 350, 4, 8, 666407) Mr. Gandhi stipulated that any demand by Mohammedans must be on behalf of the whole of them, adding: I say this purposely because there is a small body how large I do not knowwhich is called the Nationalist Muslim Party.
('53', 350, 4, 9, 666628) I cannot be false to that party.
('53', 350, 5, 10, 666661) His business was to bring the two parties of Muslims together.

('53', 350, 8, 13, 666808) LONDON, September 12, 1931
('53', 350, 9, 14, 666835) Mr. Gandhi in an interview at Kingsley Hall 2 today said: I am willing and anxious to go to Lancashire.
('53', 350, 9, 15, 666939) I want to visit the North, and most decidedly I want to go to Manchester.
('53', 350, 9, 16, 667013) I have received letters and cables advising me to go there, and saying that it would be worth while coming to England for that, even if I did not go to the Round Table Conference.
('53', 350, 9, 17, 667193) It all depends upon the people .
('53', 350, 9, 18, 667226) If they want me, they simply have to say Come.
('53', 350, 9, 19, 667273) I can see there is so much misunderstanding about what we have done with foreign cloth.
('53', 350, 9, 20, 667361) If I went up there and talked with them I should be cross examined, and would speak to them without reserve.
('53', 350, 10, 21, 667470) Mr. Gandhi said he did not know to what extent the propaganda that had been carried on had found lodgment in the minds of the people of Lancashire, but he would hope to remove any misunderstanding and would leave no stone unturned to do it.
('53', 350, 10, 22, 667711) If he went, he would be largely guided by Mr. C.F.Andrews, who knows so many
('53', 350, 11, 23, 667788) 1 The foregoing forms part of an interview given to The Sunday Times.

('53', 351, 1, 2, 668143) working men and women of Lancashire and has been in touch with many mill owners.
('53', 351, 2, 3, 668224) When he was asked for a message for the people of India, he replied: Tell them they will best help me by observing complete non violence in thought, word and deed and by following out completely the constructive programme of the Congress.
('53', 351, 3, 4, 668463) He spoke tolerantly of the English climate which has been behaving badly today, said that he knew it well in previous years and added that he did not know how it would affect him this time, when his life had to be differently arranged.
('53', 351, 3, 5, 668699) As compensation for the weather, he had the warmth of his friends here.
('53', 351, 4, 6, 668771) Someone asked him if he would go on Monday, his day of silence, to the meeting of the Federal Structure Committee.
('53', 351, 4, 7, 668886) He said: I shall place myself in the hands of the Prime Minister and of the Secretary of State for India and will do whatever they say.
('53', 351, 4, 8, 669022) If they do not think it inconvenient that I should be there and remain silent, I will gladly go and follow the proceedings.
('53', 351, 5, 9, 669146) The people living near Kingsley Hall are looking forward to meeting Mr. Gandhi, and he says that he certainly hopes to meet them .
('53', 351, 5, 10, 669277) He said : Otherwise, why should I be here?
('53', 351, 5, 11, 669320) I hope they will come here, and I will go to visit some of them in their homes if Miss Lester can arrange for me to go without being seen.
('53', 351, 6, 12, 669459) Mr. Shaukat Ali, one of the Muslim delegates to the Round Table Conference, said in an interview yesterday that he had a four hour interview with Mr. Gandhi on the communal question, and thought as a result the prospects were better.
('53', 351, 6, 13, 669693) Mr.Gandhi, when asked if he endorsed this, said : Yes; progress is always made when two people come together for discussion, especially when theirs is a friendship which has existed for as long as ten years.
('53', 351, 6, 14, 669901) There is always hope, but everything depends upon what happens here.
('53', 351, 6, 15, 669970) So far as I am concerned there is no difficulty, because I personally would endorse the Muslim claim.
('53', 351, 6, 16, 670072) I am going to write to Lord Rothermere and Mr. Winston Churchill asking if they will kindly give me an interview.
('53', 351, 6, 17, 670186) That is not a joke.
('53', 351, 6, 18, 670206) I have always asked to see those who opposed me so that I could explain my position.
('53', 351, 6, 19, 670291) I propose to find out what friends Mr. Churchill and I have in common and I shall try to approach him through his friends.
('53', 351, 6, 20, 670414) I have come here bent on peace.
('53', 351, 6, 21, 670446) God alone can give it, but I do not want to leave anything undone that can bring it about.
('53', 351, 7, 22, 670537) Is there any chance of your going home by way of America? a representative

('53', 352, 1, 2, 670656) of a famous American agency hopefully inquired.
('53', 352, 1, 3, 670704) The visitor said : No.
('53', 352, 1, 4, 670727) America does not want me.
('53', 352, 1, 5, 670753) America is not ready to receive me.
('53', 352, 1, 6, 670789) By that, of course, I mean my message.
('53', 352, 1, 7, 670828) My friends warn me, and a voice inside tells that this is so.
('53', 352, 1, 8, 670890) They might make a fuss of me and invite me to many meetings, but nothing would be done in the end.
('53', 352, 1, 9, 670989) I speak my message best to America by doing my work in India.
('53', 352, 1, 10, 671051) At the same time there are many manifestations of great interest from America.
('53', 352, 1, 11, 671130) I receive hundreds of letters; they may, of course, be merely pretexts to get my autograph, but the interest is certainly there.

('53', 352, 4, 14, 671389) September 13, 1931 In my opinion, the Indian Conference bears in its consequences not only upon India but upon the whole world.
('53', 352, 4, 15, 671517) India is by itself almost a continent.
('53', 352, 4, 16, 671556) It contains one fifth of the human race.
('53', 352, 4, 17, 671597) It represents one of the most ancient civilizations.
('53', 352, 4, 18, 671650) It has traditions handed down from tens of thousands of years, some of which, to the astonishment of the world, remain intact.
('53', 352, 4, 19, 671777) No doubt the ravages of time have affected the purity of that civilization, as they have that of many other cultures and many institutions.
('53', 352, 4, 20, 671917) If India is to perpetuate the glory of her ancient past, it can do so only when it attains freedom.
('53', 352, 4, 21, 672017) The reason for the struggle having drawn the attention of the world, I know, does not lie in the fact that we Indians are fighting for our liberty, but in the fact that the means adopted by us for attaining that liberty are unique and, as far as history shows us, have not been adopted by any other people of whom we have any record.
('53', 352, 4, 22, 672351) The means adopted are not violence, not bloodshed, not diplomacy as one understands it nowadays, but they are purely and simply truth and non violence.
('53', 352, 4, 23, 672503) No wonder that the attention of the world is directed towards this attempt to lead a successful, bloodless revolution.
('53', 352, 4, 24, 672622) Hitherto, nations have fought in the manner of the brute.
('53', 352, 5, 25, 672680) 1 The broadcast was made on the Columbia Broadcasting Service network from Kingsley Hall.
('53', 352, 5, 26, 672770) According to Louis Fischers Life of Mahatma Gandhi, before beginning his unprepared address, Gandhiji said : Do I have to speak into that? After the address was over, he remarked: Well thats over. These words also were heard by the listeners.
('53', 353, 0, 1, 673013) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 354
('53', 353, 1, 2, 673055) They have wreaked vengeance upon those whom they have considered to be their enemies.
('53', 353, 1, 3, 673141) We find in searching national anthems adopted by great nations that they contain imprecations upon the so called enemy.
('53', 353, 1, 4, 673261) They have vowed destruction and have not hesitated to take the name of God and seek Divine assistance for the destruction of the enemy.
('53', 353, 1, 5, 673397) We in India have reversed the process.
('53', 353, 1, 6, 673436) We feel that the law that governs brute creation is not the law that should guide the human race.
('53', 353, 1, 7, 673534) That law is inconsistent with human dignity.
('53', 353, 1, 8, 673579) I, personally, would wait, if need be, for ages rather than seek to attain the freedom of my country through bloody means.
('53', 353, 1, 9, 673702) I feel in the innermost recesses of my heart, after a political experience extending over an unbroken period of close upon thirty five years, that the world is sick unto death of blood spilling.
('53', 353, 1, 10, 673897) The world is seeking a way out, and I flatter myself with the belief that perhaps it will be the privilege of the ancient land of India to show that way out to the hungering world.
('53', 353, 1, 11, 674078) I have, therefore, no hesitation whatsoever in inviting all the great nations of the earth to give their hearty co operation to India in her migh ty struggle.
('53', 353, 1, 12, 674237) It must be a sight worth contemplating and treasuring that millions of people have given themselves to suffering without retaliation in order that they might vindicate the dignity and honour of the nation.
('53', 353, 1, 13, 674443) I have called that suffering a process of self purification.
('53', 353, 1, 14, 674504) It is my certain conviction that no man loses his freedom except through his own weakness.I am painfully conscious of our own weaknesses.
('53', 353, 1, 15, 674642) We represent in India all the principal religions of the earth, and it is a matter of deep humiliation to confess that we are a house divided against itself; that we Hindus and Mussalmans are flying at one another.
('53', 353, 1, 16, 674857) It is a matter of still deeper humiliation to me that we Hindus regard several millions of our own kith and kin as too degraded even for our touch.
('53', 353, 1, 17, 675005) I refer to the so called untouchables.
('53', 353, 1, 18, 675044) These are no small weaknesses in a nation struggling to be free.
('53', 353, 1, 19, 675109) You will find that, in this struggle through self purification, we have assigned a foremost [part of our] 1 creed to the removal of this curse of untouchability and the attainment of unity amongst all the different classes and communities of India representing the different creeds.
('53', 353, 1, 20, 675392) It is along the same lines that we seek to rid our land of the
('53', 353, 2, 21, 675455) 1 These words are found in Entertaining Gandhi by Muriel Lester.
('53', 354, 0, 1, 675520) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 355
('53', 354, 1, 2, 675564) curse of drink.
('53', 354, 1, 3, 675580) Happily for us, intoxicating drinks and drugs are confined to comparatively a very small number of people, largely, factory hands and the like.
('53', 354, 1, 4, 675724) Fortunately for us, the drink and drug curse is accepted as a curse.
('53', 354, 1, 5, 675793) It is not considered to be the fashion for men or women to drink or to take intoxicating drugs.
('53', 354, 1, 6, 675889) All the same, it is an uphill fight that we are fighting in trying to remove this evil from our midst.
('53', 354, 1, 7, 675992) It is a matter of regret, deep regret, for me to have to say that the existing Government has made of this evil a source of very large revenue, amounting to nearly twenty five crores of rupees.
('53', 354, 1, 8, 676186) But I am thankful to be able to say that the women of India have risen to the occasion in combating it by peaceful means, that is, by a fervent appeal to those who are given to the drink habit to give it up, and by an equally fervent appeal to the liquor dealers.
('53', 354, 1, 9, 676450) A great impression has been created upon those who are addicted to these two evil habits.
('53', 354, 1, 10, 676540) I wish that it were possible for me to say that in this, at least, we were receiving hearty co operation of the rulers.
('53', 354, 1, 11, 676660) If we could only have received the co operation without any legislation, I dare say that we would have achieved this reform and banished intoxicating drink and drugs from our afflicted land.
('53', 354, 1, 12, 676851) There is a force which has a constructive effect and which has been put forth by the nation during this struggle.
('53', 354, 1, 13, 676965) That is the great care for the semi starved millions scattered throughout the 700,000 villages dotted over a surface 1,900 miles long and 1,500 miles broad.
('53', 354, 1, 14, 677122) It is a painful phenomenon that these simple villagers, through no fault of their own, have nearly six months of the year idle upon their hands.
('53', 354, 1, 15, 677267) The time was not very long ago when every village was self sufficient in regard to the two primary human wants: food and clothing.
('53', 354, 1, 16, 677398) Unfortunately for us, the East India Company, by means I would prefer not to describe, destroyed that supplementary village industry, and the millions of spinners who had become famous through the cunning of their deft fingers for drawing the finest thread, such as has never yet been drawn by any modern machinery.
('53', 354, 1, 17, 677714) These village spinners found themselves one fine morning with their noble occupation gone.
('53', 354, 1, 18, 677805) From that day forward India has become progressively poor.
('53', 354, 1, 19, 677864) No matter what may be said to the contrary, it is a historical fact that, before the advent of the East India Company, these villagers were
('53', 355, 0, 1, 678004) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 356
('53', 355, 1, 2, 678046) not idle, and he who wants may see today that these villagers are idle.
('53', 355, 1, 3, 678118) It, therefore, required no great effort or learning to know that these villagers must starve if they cannot work for six months in the year.
('53', 355, 1, 4, 678259) May I not, then, on behalf of these semi starved millions, appeal to the conscience of the world to come to the rescue of a people dying for regaining its liberty ?

('53', 355, 3, 8, 678572) Though prayer, it was said, was to the soul what food was to the body, yet prayer was far more important for the soul than food was for the body, because we could at times go without food and the body would feel the better for the fast, but there was no such thing as prayer fast.
('53', 355, 3, 9, 678853) He said : We can over indulge in food.

('53', 356, 6, 9, 679450) In an exclusive interview to the Chronicle, Mahatmaji answered a number of questions today.
('53', 356, 6, 10, 679542) Asked whether, at the meeting of the Federal Structure Com mittee on Monday, Lord Sankey announced Governments new scheme for consideration and whether Mahatmaji felt the Congress would be prepared to accept any scheme which fell short of what it had accepted by ratifying the Delhi Pact, Gandhiji answered : I must not anticipate any scheme that Lord Sankey wishes to bring forward.
('53', 356, 7, 11, 679926) Q. Do you believe that, in a scheme of federation composed of divergent systems of government obtainable in British India and in Indian States, it is possible to find a fusion between democracy and absolute autocracy ?
('53', 356, 8, 12, 680145) A. By mutual give and take I see no difficulty.
('53', 356, 9, 13, 680193) Q. Since the subjects of the Indian States are not represented at the R.T.
('53', 356, 10, 14, 680268) Conference, do you think the Congress can force the Princes to accept a democratic
('53', 356, 11, 15, 680351) form of government for their States ?
('53', 356, 12, 16, 680389) A. The Princes are capable of doing many things, but what they will do actually I do not know.
('53', 356, 13, 17, 680484) Q. In the absence of the representative of Nationalist Muslims, do you
('53', 356, 14, 18, 680555) believe it is possible to deliberate upon the Hindu Muslim question with any measure
('53', 356, 15, 19, 680640) of success ?
('53', 356, 16, 20, 680653) A. It will be certainly a difficult task if not almost an impossible one.

('53', 357, 1, 2, 680883) blunder of preventing Dr. Ansari from being selected as a delegate was responsible for committing a fatal blunder.
('53', 357, 2, 3, 680998) Q. In the light of the recent declaration of the National Government, representing the three British Parties, that there shall be no change in the policy on the Indian issue, do you still believe that the external circumstances are such as to warrant a feeling of optimism regarding India attaining Dominion Status on the lines of the Karachi resolution ?
('53', 357, 3, 4, 681354) A. The question betrays two errors.
('53', 357, 3, 5, 681390) You think that my hop ing against hope depends upon external circumstances, whereas what I said in Bombay and what I have no reason to alter was that, although there was nothing on the horizon to warrant hope, being a born optimist.
('53', 357, 3, 6, 681623) I hoped against hope.
('53', 357, 3, 7, 681645) For a hope there can be no reasons.
('53', 357, 3, 8, 681681) It is a matter of faith in ones cause and means.

('53', 358, 2, 3, 682547) LONDON, September 15, 1931
('53', 358, 3, 4, 682574) LORD CHANCELLOR, YOUR HIGHNESSES AND FRIENDS, I must confess at the outset that I am not a little embarrassed in having to state before you the position of the Indian National Congress.
('53', 358, 3, 5, 682760) I would like to say that I have come to London to attend this Committee, as also the Round Table Conference when the proper time comes, absolutely in the spirit of co operation, and to strive to my utmost to find points of agreement.
('53', 358, 3, 6, 682994) I would like also to give this assurance to His Majestys Government that at no stage is it, or will it be, my desire to embarrass authority and I would like to give the same assurance to my colleagues here, that, however much we may differ about our view points, I shall not obstruct them in any shape or form.
('53', 358, 3, 7, 683305) My position, therefore, here depends entirely upon your goodwill, as also the goodwill of His Majestys Government.
('53', 358, 3, 8, 683420) If at any time I found that I could not be of any useful service to the Conference, I would not hesitate to withdraw myself from it.
('53', 358, 3, 9, 683553) I can also say to those who are responsible for the management of this Committee and the Conference that they have only to give a sign and I should have no hesitation in withdrawing.
('53', 358, 3, 10, 683736) I am obliged to make these remarks because I know that there are fundamental differences of opinion between the Government and the Congress, and it is possible that there are vital differences between my colleagues and myself.
('53', 358, 3, 11, 683963) There is also a limitation under which I
('53', 358, 4, 12, 684004) 1 The second session of the Round Table Conference was held between September 7 and December 1, 1931. There were altogether 112 delegates 20 representing the British Government, 23 Indian States and 69 British India.
('53', 358, 4, 13, 684221) Gandhiji attended the second session as the sole representative of the Congress.
('53', 358, 4, 14, 684302) Ramsay MacDonald, Prime Minister, was the Chairman of the Conference.
('53', 358, 4, 15, 684372) The second session did not open with a meeting of the full Conference.
('53', 358, 4, 16, 684443) The Federal Structure Committee reassembled on September 7, and the Minorities Committee on September 28, followed by a Plenary Session beginning on November 28, 1931. The other Committees of the Conference did not reassemble.
('53', 358, 4, 17, 684670) The Federal Structure Committee, over whose deliberations Lord Sankey presided, had the following Heads for discussion : 1 Strength and Composition of the Federal Legislature.
('53', 359, 0, 1, 684846) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 360
('53', 359, 1, 2, 684888) .shall be working.
('53', 359, 1, 3, 684907) I am but a poor humble agent acting on behalf of the Indian National Congress.
('53', 359, 1, 4, 684986) And it might be as well to remind ourselves of what the Congress stands for and what it is.
('53', 359, 1, 5, 685078) You will then extend your sympathy to me, because I know that the burden that rests upon my shoulders is really very great.
('53', 359, 1, 6, 685202) The Congress is, if I am not mistaken, the oldest political organizaton we have in India.
('53', 359, 1, 7, 685292) It has had nearly 50 years of life, during which period it has, without any interruption, held its annual ses sion.
('53', 359, 1, 8, 685408) It is what it meansnational.
('53', 359, 1, 9, 685437) It represents no particular community, no particular class, no particular interest.
('53', 359, 1, 10, 685521) It claims to represent all Indian interests and all classes.
('53', 359, 1, 11, 685582) It is a matter of the greatest pleasure to me to state that it was first conceived in an English brain: Allan Octavius Hume we knew as the father of the Congress.
('53', 359, 1, 12, 685745) It was nursed by two great Parsis, pherozeshah Mehta and Dadabhai Naoroji, whom all India delighted to recognize as its Grand Old Man.
('53', 359, 1, 13, 685880) From the very commencement the Congress had Mussalmans, Christians, Anglo IndiansI might say all the religions, sects, creedsrepresented upon it more or less fully.
('53', 359, 1, 14, 686045) The late Badruddin Tyabji identified himself with the Congress.
('53', 359, 1, 15, 686109) We have had Mussalmans as Presidents of the Congress, and Parsis undoubtedly.
('53', 359, 1, 16, 686187) I can recall at least one Indian Christian at the present moment, W.C. Bonnerji, Kalicharen Bannerji, than whom I have not had the privilege of knowing a purer Indian, was also thoroughly identiied with the Congress.
('53', 359, 1, 17, 686404) I miss, as I have no doubt all of you miss, the presence in our midst of Mr. K.T. Paul.
('53', 359, 1, 18, 686492) AlthoughI do not know, but so far as I knowhe never officially belonged to the Congress, he was a nationalist to the full.
('53', 359, 1, 19, 686615) As you know, the late Maulana Mohammed Ali, whose presence also we miss today, was a President of the Congress, and at present we have four Mussalmans as members of the Working Committee, which consists of 15 members.
('53', 359, 1, 20, 686833) We have had women as our Presidents : Dr. Annie Besant was the first, and Mrs. Sarojini Naidu
('53', 359, 2, 21, 686927) .2 Questions connected with the Election of Members of the Federal Legislature.
('53', 359, 2, 22, 687007) 3 Relations between the two Chambers of the Federal Ligislature.
('53', 359, 2, 23, 687072) 4 Distribution of Financial Resources between the Federation and its Units.
('53', 359, 2, 24, 687148) 5 The Ministry and its Relations with the Legislature.
('53', 359, 2, 25, 687203) 6 Distribution of Legislative powers between the federal and provincial Legislatures, and effect in the States of Legislation relating to Federal Subjects.
('53', 359, 2, 26, 687359) 7 Administrative Relations between the Federal Government, the States and the Provinces.
('53', 359, 2, 27, 687448) 8 The Federal Court.
('53', 360, 0, 1, 687469) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 361
('53', 360, 1, 2, 687513) followed; we have her as a member of the Working Committee also.
('53', 360, 1, 3, 687578) And so, if we have no distinctions of class or creed, we have no distinctions of sex either.
('53', 360, 1, 4, 687671) The Congress has, from its very commencement, taken up the cause of the so called untouchables.
('53', 360, 1, 5, 687767) There was a time when the Congress had at every annual session as its adjunct the Social Conference, to which the late Ranade dedicated his energies, among his many other activities.
('53', 360, 1, 6, 687950) Headed by him you will find, in the programme of the Social Confe rence, reform in connection with the untouchables taking a prominent place.
('53', 360, 1, 7, 688092) But in 1920, the Congress took a large step and brought in the question of the removal of untouchability as a plank on the political platform, making it an important item of the political programme.
('53', 360, 1, 8, 688291) Just as the Congress considered HIndu Muslim unity thereby meaning unity amongst all the classes to be indispensable for the attainment of swaraj, so also did the Congress consider the removal of the curse of untouchability as an indispensable condition for the attainment of full freedom.
('53', 360, 1, 9, 688581) The position the Congress took up in 1920 remains the same today; and so you will see the Congress has attempted from its very beginning to be what it described itself to be, namely, national in every sense of the term.
('53', 360, 1, 10, 688801) If Your Highnesses will permit me to say so, in the very early stages the Congress took up your cause also.
('53', 360, 1, 11, 688909) Let me remind this Committee that it was the Grand Old Man of India who sponsored the cause of Kashmir and Mysore; and these two great Houses, I venture in all humility to submit, owe not a little to the efforts of Dadabhai Naoroji and the Congress.
('53', 360, 1, 12, 689159) Even up to now the Congress has endeavoured to serve the Princes of India by refraining from any interference in their domestic and internal affairs.
('53', 360, 1, 13, 689309) I hope, therefore, that this brief introduction that I thought fit to give will serve to enable the Committee, and those who are at all interested in the claims of the Congress, to understand that it has endeavoured to deserve the claim that it has made.
('53', 360, 1, 14, 689564) It has failed, I know, often to live up to the claim but I venture to submit that, if you were to examine the history of the Congress, you would find that it has more often succeeded, and progressively succeeded than failed.
('53', 360, 1, 15, 689789) Above all , the Congress represents, in its essence, the dumb, semi starved millions scattered over the length and breadth of the land in its 700,000 villages, no matter whether they come from what is called
('53', 361, 0, 1, 689997) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 362
('53', 361, 1, 2, 690039) British India or what is called Indian India.
('53', 361, 1, 3, 690085) Every interest which, in the opinion of the Congress, is worthy of protection, has to subserve the interests of these dumb millions; and so you do find now and again apparently a clash between several interests.
('53', 361, 1, 4, 690297) But, if there is a genuine real clash, I have no hesitation in saying on behalf of the Congress that the Congress will sacrifice every interest for the sake of the interests of these dumb millions.
('53', 361, 1, 5, 690495) It is, therefore, essentially a peasant organization, and it is becoming so progressively.
('53', 361, 1, 6, 690586) You will even the Indian members of the Committee perhaps be astonished to find that today the Congress, through its organization, the All India Spinners Association, is finding work for nearly 50,000 women in nearly 2,000 villages, and these women are possibly 50 per cent Mussalman women.
('53', 361, 1, 7, 690877) Thousands of them belong to the so called untouchable class.
('53', 361, 1, 8, 690938) We have thus, in this constructive manner, penetrated these villages, and effort is being mde to cover every one of the 700,000 villages.
('53', 361, 1, 9, 691076) It is a super human task; but if human effort can do so, you will presently find the Congress covering all of these villages and bringing to them the message of the spinning wheel.
('53', 361, 1, 10, 691257) That being the representative character of the Congress, you will not be astonished when I read to you the Congress mandate.
('53', 361, 1, 11, 691382) I hope that it may not jar upon you.
('53', 361, 1, 12, 691419) You may consider that the Congress is making a claim which is wholly untenable.
('53', 361, 1, 13, 691499) Such as it is, I am here to put forth that claim on behalf of the Congress in the gentlest manner possible, but also in the firmest manner possible.
('53', 361, 1, 14, 691648) I have come here to prosecute that claim with all the faith and energy that I can command.
('53', 361, 1, 15, 691739) If you can convince me to the contrary and show that the claim is inimical to the interests of these dumb millions, I shall revise my opinion.
('53', 361, 1, 16, 691882) I am open to conviction, but even so I should have to ask my principals to consent to that revision before I could usefully act as the agent of the Congress.
('53', 361, 1, 17, 692040) At this stage I propose to read to you this mandate so that you can understand clearly the limitations imposed upon me.
('53', 361, 1, 18, 692160) This was a resolution passed at the Karachi Congress:
('53', 361, 2, 19, 692214) This Congress, having considered the Provisional Settlement between the Working Committee and the Government of India, endorses it, and desires to make it clear that the Congress goal of purna swaraj, meaning complete independence, remains intact.
('53', 361, 2, 20, 692462) In the event of a way remaining otherwise open to the Congress to be represented at any Conference with the representatives of the British Government, the Congress Delegation will work for this goal; and in particular, so as to give the nation control over the army, external
('53', 362, 0, 1, 692738) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 363
('53', 362, 1, 2, 692782) affairs, finance, fiscal and economic policy, and to have scrutiny by an impartial tribunal of the financial transactions of the British Government in India, and to examine and assess the obligations to be undertaken by India or England and the right to either party to end the partnership at will: provided, however, that the Congress Delegation will be free to accept such adjustments as may be demonstrably necessary in the interests of India.
('53', 362, 1, 3, 693229) Then follows the appointment.
('53', 362, 1, 4, 693259) I have in the light of this mandate endeavoured, as carefully as I was capable, to study the provisional conclusions arrived at by the seve ral Sub committees appointed by the Round Table Conference.
('53', 362, 1, 5, 693459) I have also carefully studied the Prime Ministers statement giving the consi dered policy of His Majestys Government.
('53', 362, 1, 6, 693577) I speak as subject to correction; but, so far as I have been able to understand this document, it falls far short of what is aimed at and claimed by the Congress.
('53', 362, 1, 7, 693740) True, I have the liberty to accept such adjustments as may be demonstrably necessary in the intrests of India, but they have all to be consistent with the fundamentals stated in this mandate.
('53', 362, 1, 8, 693932) I remind myself at this stage of the terms of what is to me a sacred settlement the settlement arrived at Delhi between the Government of India and the Congress.
('53', 362, 1, 9, 694094) In that Settlement the Congress has accepted the principle of federation, the principle that there should be responsibility at the Centre, and has accepted also the principle that there should be safeguards in so far as they may be necessary in the interests of India.
('53', 362, 1, 10, 694363) There was one phrase used yesterday.
('53', 362, 1, 11, 694400) I forget by which Delegate, but it struck me very forcibly.
('53', 362, 1, 12, 694460) He said, We do not want a mere political constitution.
('53', 362, 1, 13, 694515) I do not know that he gave that expression the same meaning that it immediately bore to me; but I immediately said to myself, this phrase has given me a good expression.
('53', 362, 1, 14, 694685) It is true the Congress will not be and, personally speaking.
('53', 362, 1, 15, 694747) I myself would never be satisfied with a mere political constitution, which to read would seem to give India all it can possibly politically desire, but in reality would give her nothing.
('53', 362, 1, 16, 694935) If we are intent upon complete independence, it is not from any sense of arrogance; it is not because we want to parade before the universe that we have now severed all connection with the British people.
('53', 362, 1, 17, 695140) Nothing of the kind.
('53', 362, 1, 18, 695161) On the contrary, you find in this mandate itself that the Congress contemplates a partnership the Congress contemplates a connection with the British people but that connection to be such as
('53', 363, 0, 1, 695352) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 364
('53', 363, 1, 2, 695394) can exist between two absolute equals.
('53', 363, 1, 3, 695433) Time was when I prided myself on being, and being called, a British subject.
('53', 363, 1, 4, 695510) I have ceased for many years to call myself a British subject; I would far rather be called a rebel than a subject.
('53', 363, 1, 5, 695626) But I have aspired I still aspire to be a citizen, not of the Empire, but in a Commonwealth; in a partnership if possibleif God wills it, an indissoluble partnership but not a partnership superimposed upon one nation by another.
('53', 363, 1, 6, 695855) Hence you find here that the Congress claims that either party should have the right to sever the connection, to dissolve the partnership.
('53', 363, 1, 7, 695994) It has got to be necessarily, therefore, of mutual benefit.
('53', 363, 1, 8, 696054) May I say it may be irrelevant to the consideration, but not irrelevant to methat, as I have said elsewhere, I can quite understand the responsible British statesmen today being wholly engrossed in domestic affairs, in trying to make two ends meet.
('53', 363, 1, 9, 696303) We could not expect them to do anything less; and I wondered, even as I was sailing towards London, whether we in the Committee at the present moment would not be a drag upon the British Ministers whether we would not be interlopers.
('53', 363, 1, 10, 696537) And yet I said to myself: It is possible that we might not be interlopers; it is possible that the British Ministers themselves might consider the proceedings of the Round Table Conference to be of primary importance even in terms of their domestic affairs.
('53', 363, 1, 11, 696795) India, yes, can be held by the sword!
('53', 363, 1, 12, 696833) I do not for one moment doubt the ability of Britain to hold India under subjection through the sword.
('53', 363, 1, 13, 696936) But what will conduce to the prosperity of Great Britain, the economic freedom of Great Britain an enslaved but rebellious India, or an India an esteemed partner with Britain to share her sorrows to take part side by side with Britain in her misfortunes?
('53', 363, 1, 14, 697191) if need be, but at her own will, to fight side by side with Britain not for the exploitation of a single race or a single human being on earth, but it may be conceivably for the good of the whole world!
('53', 363, 1, 15, 697394) If I want freedom for my country, believe me, if I can possibly help it, I do not want that freedom in order that I, belonging to a nation which counts one fifth of the human race, may exploit any other race upon earth or any single individual.
('53', 363, 1, 16, 697639) If I want that freedom for my country, I would not be deserving of that freedom if I did not cherish and treasure the equal right of every other race, weak or strong, to the same freedom.
('53', 363, 1, 17, 697827) And so I said to myself whilst I was nearing the shores of your beautiful island, per chance it might be possible for me to convince the British Ministers that India as a valuable partner, not held by force but by the silken cord of love an India of that character might
('53', 364, 0, 1, 698098) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 365
('53', 364, 1, 2, 698142) conceivably be of real assistance to you in balancing your Budget, not for one occasion but for many years.
('53', 364, 1, 3, 698250) What cannot two nations do one a handful, but brave, with a record for bravery perhaps unequalled, a nation noted for having fought slavery, a nation that has at least claimed times without number to protect the weak and another a very ancient nation, counted in millions, with a glorious and ancient past, representing at the present moment two great cultures, the Islamic and Hindu cultures; if you will, also containing not a small but a very large number of Christian popu lation; and certainly absorbing the whole of the splendid Zoroastrian stock, in numbers almost beneath contempt, but in philanthropy and enterprise almost unequalled and certainly unsurpassed.
('53', 364, 1, 4, 698920) We have got all these cultures concentrated in India.
('53', 364, 1, 5, 698974) And supposing that God fires both Hindus and Musslmans represented here with a proper spirit, so that they close ranks and come to an honourable understanding take that nation and this nation together, and I again ask myself and ask you whether, with an India free, completely independent as Great Britain is, whether an honourable partnership between these two cannot be mutualy beneficial, even in terms of the domestic affairs of this great nation.
('53', 364, 1, 6, 699426) And so, in that dreamy hope, I have approached the British Isles, and I shall still cherish that dream.
('53', 364, 2, 7, 699530) And when I have said this perhaps I have said all; and you will be able to dot the is and to cross the ts, not execting me to fill in all the details, and tell you what I mean by control over the Army, what I mean by control over external affairs, finance, fiscal and economic policy, or even the financial transactions which a friend yesterday considered to be sacrosanct.
('53', 364, 2, 8, 699904) I do not take that view.
('53', 364, 2, 9, 699929) If there is a stock taking between incoming and outgoing partners, their transactions are subject to audit and adjustment; and the Congress will not be guilty of any dishonourable conduct or crime in saying that the nation should understand what it is to take over and what it should not take over.
('53', 364, 2, 10, 700228) This audit, this scrutiny, is asked for not merely in the interests of India; it is asked for in the interests of both.
('53', 364, 2, 11, 700348) I am positive that the British people do not want to saddle upon India a single burden which it should not legitimately bear; and I am here to declare, on behalf of the Congress, that the Congress will never think of repudiating a single claim or a burden that it should justly discharge.
('53', 364, 2, 12, 700637) If we are to live as an honourable nation worthy of commanding credit from the whole world, we will pay every farthing of legitimate debt with our blood.
('53', 365, 0, 1, 700791) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 366
('53', 365, 1, 2, 700833) I do not think that I should take you any further through the clauses of this mandate an analyse for you the meaning of these clauses as Congressmen give them.
('53', 365, 1, 3, 700993) If it is Gods will that I should continue to take part in these deliberations, as the deliberations proceed, I shall be able to explain the implications of these clauses.
('53', 365, 1, 4, 701164) As the deliberations proceed, I would have my say in connection with the safeguards also.
('53', 365, 1, 5, 701254) But I think I have said quite enough in having, with some elaboration and with your generous indulgence, Lord Chancellor, taken the time of this meeting.
('53', 365, 1, 6, 701408) I had not intended really to take that time, but I felt that I could not possibly do justice to the cause that I have come to expound to you, the Committee, and to the British nation of which we, the Indian Delegates, are at present the guests, if I did not give you out of the whole of my heart my cherished wish even at this time.
('53', 365, 1, 7, 701741) I would love to go away from the shores of the British Isles with the conviction that there was to be an honourable and equal partnership between Great Britain and India.
('53', 365, 1, 8, 701912) I cannot do anything more than say that it will be my fervent prayer, during all the days that I live in your midst, that this consummation may be reached.
('53', 365, 1, 9, 702068) I thank you, Lord Chancellor, for courtesy that you have extended to me in not stopping me, although I have taken close upon forty five minutes.
('53', 365, 1, 10, 702213) I was not entitled to all that indulgence, and I thank you once more.

('53', 365, 3, 12, 702414) 421. SPEECH AT MEETING OF LABOUR M.P.S 1
('53', 365, 4, 13, 702455) LONDON, September 16, 1931
('53', 365, 5, 14, 702482) Mr. Gandhi addressed the Labour members of the House of Commons this evening.
('53', 365, 5, 15, 702560) In his address he stated that he had been sent to this country to adhere to the pledge he had given, that was, to get complete independence as far as India was concerned.
('53', 365, 5, 16, 702731) This was in the interests of Indias villagers, who were being starved as the result of the administration and the taxes they had to pay.
('53', 365, 6, 17, 702868) 1 This was held in the Grand Committee Room in the House of Commons.
('53', 365, 6, 18, 702937) Mr. Lansbury, M.P., Miss Muriel Lester and J.F. Horaabin, M.P., were among those present.
('53', 366, 0, 1, 703027) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 367
('53', 366, 1, 2, 703071) An observation of his struck his trade union hearers as being remarkable.
('53', 366, 1, 3, 703145) That was when he advocated the doing away machinery and letting the villagers work with their hands.
('53', 366, 1, 4, 703246) If anyone asked the villagers why he led them, they would find that it was because they could not express themselves, but that he was expressing their aspirations for them.
('53', 366, 1, 5, 703419) Mr. Gandhi said he had come to this country in pursuance of the promise he had made to Lord Irwin to attend the Round Table Conference.
('53', 366, 1, 6, 703555) He would as soon adopt any other words as complete independence, if their contents were identical.
('53', 366, 1, 7, 703654) It was the substance he wanted, not the shadow.
('53', 366, 1, 8, 703702) He proposed to disregard the ordinary canons of caution he had imposed on himself, and to try to make them understand his feelings, shared by many millions of his countrymen.
('53', 366, 1, 9, 703877) He repeated his demands for complete independence, control of the army, and external affairs.
('53', 366, 1, 10, 703971) In other words, he wanted the identical freedom for India that was enjoyed in Great Britain.
('53', 366, 1, 11, 704064) Nothing less would satisfy India.
('53', 366, 1, 12, 704098) He had no authority to enter into any compromise, though, if that one thing were assured them, they would find him entering into many compromises, while, if it was not assured, he would enter into none.
('53', 366, 1, 13, 704301) He did not want complete independence as a menace to any single race in the world.
('53', 366, 1, 14, 704384) If he could, he wanted to promote real friendship between Great Britain and India.
('53', 366, 1, 15, 704467) He was an open rebel against British rule and power, but thousands of his countrymen were secret rebels because they did not want to suffer the in convenience of open rebellion.
('53', 366, 1, 16, 704645) He warned his hearers to disabuse their minds of any delusion to the contrary.
('53', 366, 1, 17, 704724) If the people wanted to throw off the British yoke and become completely independent, it was because they did not want to starve.
('53', 366, 1, 18, 704854) Tremendous military power in India was not required for defence from external aggression.
('53', 366, 1, 19, 704944) He had been told that, if unfortunately, there was another battle to be fought, it would be different and more intense.
('53', 366, 1, 20, 705064) He did not need that reminder.
('53', 366, 1, 21, 705095) They were walking with their backs to the wall, and he wanted those present to save India from those fiery days if they could possibly do so.
('53', 366, 2, 22, 705237) Mr. Shinwell said that thousands of Indian labourers working the coal mines were employed by Indian coal owners and not British, and he found that the Indian coal owners were much more reactionary and brutal to their employees than British coal owners.
('53', 366, 2, 23, 705490) How did Mr. Gandhi reconcile what he said about British rule with the reactionary outlook of the Indian industrialists?
('53', 366, 3, 24, 705610) Mr. Gandhi said that, when he spoke, he was not thinking about these few thousand labourers in the coal mines or in the factories of Bombay and Calcutta.
('53', 366, 3, 25, 705764) He held no brief for the land owners or mill owners.
('53', 366, 3, 26, 705817) It was not his case whether or not Indian industrialists were more heartless than British.
('53', 366, 3, 27, 705908) His case was in connection with the Indians living in villages and not with that kind of oppression.
('53', 366, 3, 28, 706009) His complaint was about the system by which the last
('53', 367, 0, 1, 706062) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 368
('53', 367, 1, 2, 706104) drop of blood was drained from the villagers.
('53', 367, 1, 3, 706150) The labourers in the coal mines were oppressed but were not starving, and he was speaking about the people who were actually starving.
('53', 367, 1, 4, 706285) Eighty four per cent of the population of India lived in villages which were bled white through the present system, and were compulsorily idle for six months in the year.
('53', 367, 1, 5, 706456) If British labourers were idle six months without pay, would they not starve, especially if they had also to pay a revenue to the Government ?
('53', 367, 1, 6, 706599) A Lancashire member then asked Mr. Gandhi on what lines he justified the boycott of Lancashire goods.
('53', 367, 1, 7, 706701) Mr. Gandhi said that India ought to be free to use her own cotton wear to the exclusion entirely of cotton wear from Lancashire, Japan or Italy, or any part of the world.
('53', 367, 1, 8, 706872) It was not directed against the British people.
('53', 367, 1, 9, 706920) Did they think it was any part of the duty of India to buy cotton piece goods?
('53', 367, 1, 10, 706999) His case was restricted to the villages, and the whole scheme of the exclusion of foreign cloth had been conceived in the interests of the villagers.
('53', 367, 1, 11, 707149) Were they committing any moral breach if they produced their own cloth in their villages or mills, and used only that cloth?
('53', 367, 1, 12, 707274) The result was that they were putting sixty crores of rupees directly into the pockets of the poor man.
('53', 367, 1, 13, 707378) Was there any canon of morality which compelled him to prefer Lancashire cloth in order to sustain Lancashire labourers, who through all these years had been impoverishing them?
('53', 367, 1, 14, 707556) Lancashire rose on the ruins of the Indian Village industry.
('53', 367, 2, 15, 707617) Sir Norman Angell asked if the effect of the present Indian protection was not to have Lancashire goods replaced by Bombay and Calcutta, and that the same problem of the six months of idleness in the villages would remain if one developed the industries of Bombay and created an industrialization of India.
('53', 367, 2, 16, 707924) That point would remain if British power was withdrawn.
('53', 367, 3, 17, 707980) Mr. Gandhi replied that his energies were concentrated on the villagers, and that the boycott campaign was being carried on in the interests of the villagers.
('53', 367, 3, 18, 708139) If they had only their own mills to deal with, they would be able to do so without the slightest difficulty.
('53', 367, 3, 19, 708248) The mill owners had come to terms with them not to compete with the village industry.
('53', 367, 3, 20, 708334) This village industry was a vast industry covering 2,000 villages and supporting 100,000 spinners in those villages.
('53', 367, 3, 21, 708451) One third of the piece goods used were today produced on the handlooms, though they were working with mill spun yarn.
('53', 367, 3, 22, 708569) He wanted hand spun yarn.
('53', 367, 3, 23, 708595) He wanted the English to give him British skill to perfect the hand spinning machine, and they would be glad to know that a British engineer had left with him a simpler pattern of handloom which would give better results, for which he was charging no patent rights, but was making a gift of his invention.
('53', 367, 3, 24, 708901) This boycott movement was not for the benefit of the mills and, if they tried to crush it they would be crushed.
('53', 367, 3, 25, 709014) Mr. Tout, M.P., said that from Mr. Gandhis reply there was no truth then in the often repeated statement that the boycott was subsidized by the Bombay mill 
('53', 368, 0, 1, 709171) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 369
('53', 368, 1, 2, 709215) owners.
('53', 368, 1, 3, 709223) Mr. Gandhi said that Bombay mill owners had given, and given with some generosity, but all the accounts of the movement were open.
('53', 368, 1, 4, 709354) The boycott movement had also received assistance from the villagers.
('53', 368, 1, 5, 709424) If they wished to proclaim a boycott of Indian mills, they could do so.
('53', 368, 1, 6, 709496) He spoke as an expert of the village industry and declared if the mills of Bombay and Calcutta were destroyed by an earthquake, and every foreign country refused to supply cotton, the village industry would within a month be able to supply all their requirements in cotton cloth.
('53', 368, 1, 7, 709776) Another Labour member then asked what India would do if other countries refused to buy her jute and her tea.
('53', 368, 1, 8, 709885) How could we buy tea from India if India did not buy cloth from Lancashire?
('53', 368, 1, 9, 709961) Mr. Gandhi replied it was a matter of free will.
('53', 368, 1, 10, 710010) They did not want to force their goods on an unwilling world.
('53', 368, 1, 11, 710072) They produced them because there was a demand for them, and if other countries would not buy them, they would have to take up some other industry.
('53', 368, 1, 12, 710219) Miss Wilkinson asked if it was not a reactionary policy to refuse to use the inventions of science, and if, by refusing to use the inventions of the human mind, the result would not be to keep India poor.
('53', 368, 1, 13, 710424) Mr. Gandhi said he was trying to wean India from all machinery.
('53', 368, 1, 14, 710488) They had millions of people who could do this work by their hands, and it would be suicidal to have machines that would produce all this cloth with a few thousand workers.
('53', 368, 1, 15, 710660) He considered it would be immoral for him to do that when he could give these people no other occupation.

('53', 368, 4, 18, 710835) LONDON, September 17, 1931
('53', 368, 5, 19, 710862) Mr Gandhi, before replying to the questions which had been submitted to him beforehand by the Editor of Textile Mercury, said he would like to send out a message which he hoped would be sympathetically received and understood by everyone engaged in the Lancashire cotton industry.
('53', 368, 5, 20, 711143) He declared : I know that the question is extremely difficult, but with the creation of goodwill between the two countries, I can see no reason for despair.
('53', 368, 5, 21, 711300) The one indispensable condition is to set ones face resolutely against the vicious propaganda going on today in England to prejudice the Indian cause and to spread all kinds of rumours
('53', 368, 6, 22, 711485) 1 After the meeting Gandhiji held his prayers and left for Kingsley Hall.

('53', 369, 1, 2, 711601) against the Indian National Congress, which can be demonstrated to the full.
('53', 369, 1, 3, 711678) While I am in England, I will consider it a privilege if I can remove all cause for misunderstanding, and with that end in view I am going to Lancashire next week.
('53', 369, 1, 4, 711842) I go there with the friendliest motives; I would invite all to cross examine me, and I promise to speak without the slightest mental reservation.
('53', 369, 2, 5, 711988) Q. What is the real cause of the decline in Lancashires cloth trade in India ?
('53', 369, 3, 6, 712067) A. In my opinion, not one but several causes.
('53', 369, 3, 7, 712113) The boycott was and is, undoubtedly, one of the causes.
('53', 369, 3, 8, 712169) The chief cause is the defeat of Lancashire by Japan.
('53', 369, 3, 9, 712223) It should be remembered that the Indian boycott is not against Lancashire piece goods, but against all foreign piece goods, and yet Japan has made tremendous headway as compared to Lancashire.
('53', 369, 3, 10, 712416) The third cause is universal, namely the declining capacity of the people to buy even the necessaries of life.
('53', 369, 3, 11, 712527) The fourth is the ever increasing production of Indian mills, and the fifth and last, is the growing desire of the villagers of India to manufacture cloth in their own homes.
('53', 369, 4, 12, 712702) Q. Is there an active campaign to oust Lancashire?
('53', 369, 5, 13, 712753) A. Since the Delhi Settlement there is absolutely no campaign, active or otherwise, to oust Lancashire in preferece to any other foreign competitor.
('53', 369, 5, 14, 712902) Preference for indigenous clothwhether mill manufactured or homespuncertainly continues.
('53', 369, 6, 15, 712991) Q. Are Japanese goods preferred?
('53', 369, 6, 16, 713024) If so, why?
('53', 369, 7, 17, 713036) A. At the present moment there is certainly no preference given to Japanese goods.
('53', 369, 8, 18, 713119) Q. Is Indias cloth consumption unchanged?
('53', 369, 8, 19, 713161) If showing a decline, what percentage?
('53', 369, 9, 20, 713200) A. I think there is a decline, but imperceptible.
('53', 369, 10, 21, 713250) Q. How can Lancashire increase her trade with India?
('53', 369, 10, 22, 713303) What are the prospects?
('53', 369, 10, 23, 713327) Is it a question of price, quality, or anti British compaign?
('53', 369, 11, 24, 713389) A. The only way Lancashire can possibly increase her trade with India I pointed out some months ago.
('53', 369, 11, 25, 713490) 1 Supposing there were a full hearted settlement with India and supposing India had to buy foreign cloth to suppplement indigenous homespun and millspun, preference would be given to Lancashire over all other foreign cloth.
('53', 369, 11, 26, 713714) Of course, the question of quality and price would still have to be

('53', 370, 2, 3, 713933) Q. What percentage of her own needs, in textiles, can India supply?
('53', 370, 2, 4, 714001) How much of this is factory made, and how much is produced on handlooms?
('53', 370, 3, 5, 714074) A. In my opinion India is able, with certain facilities, to manufacture sufficient textiles in her village supplemented by indigenous mills without any difficulty.
('53', 370, 3, 6, 714238) At the present moment, onethird of Indias cloth supply is manufactured on handlooms, one third in mills, and one third is imported.
('53', 370, 3, 7, 714370) My message to Textiles Mercury and through it to Lancashire is not to prejudge the whole issue through prejudices, but to study it in all its bearings.

('53', 370, 5, 10, 714587) LONDON, [September 17, 1931] 1
('53', 370, 6, 11, 714618) I love the East End, particularly the little urchins in the streets.
('53', 370, 6, 12, 714687) They give me such friendly greetings.
('53', 370, 6, 13, 714725) I have seen a tre mendous change in social conditions since I was in London forty years ago.
('53', 370, 6, 14, 714818) The poverty in London is nothing to what it is in India.
('53', 370, 6, 15, 714875) I go down the streets here and I see outside each house a bottle of milk, and inside the door there is a strip of carpet, perhaps a piano in the sitting room.
('53', 370, 6, 16, 715034) In India several millions wear only a loin cloth.
('53', 370, 6, 17, 715084) That is why I wear a loin cloth myself.
('53', 370, 6, 18, 715124) They call me half naked.
('53', 370, 6, 19, 715149) I do it deliberately in order to identify myself with the poorest of the poor in India.
('53', 370, 6, 20, 715237) What impresses me about London is that there is not the same glaring difference between rich and poor.
('53', 370, 6, 21, 715340) As I drive down in my car to Bow every night, I have been noticing how gradual is the change from the riches of the West End to the poverty of the East End.
('53', 370, 6, 22, 715497) It is perhaps not an exaggeration to say that the poor in London have as high a standard of living as the rich in India.
('53', 370, 7, 23, 715618) Speaking of the Round Table Conference, Mr. Gandhi said: I am disturbed about the position.
('53', 370, 7, 24, 715710) We are making such very slow progress.
('53', 370, 7, 25, 715749) We have been here five days, and so far what we have
('53', 370, 8, 26, 715802) 1 The source does not mention the date.
('53', 370, 8, 27, 715842) But the correspondent said Gandhiji gave him the interview Yesterday.
('53', 370, 8, 28, 715912) If he was writing on the 18th, the interview probably took place on the 17th.
('53', 371, 0, 1, 715990) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 372
('53', 371, 1, 2, 716032) accomplished might have been done in four or five hours.
('53', 371, 1, 3, 716089) The Government is like a Sphinx.
('53', 371, 1, 4, 716122) It is so cautious in its utterances that it is impossible to know where it stands.
('53', 371, 1, 5, 716205) We cannot get on until it states its views.
('53', 371, 1, 6, 716249) We must know how far it is prepared to go.
('53', 371, 1, 7, 716292) I have spoken gently this week, but I do not know how long I shall be able to bear this hopeless uncertainty, for which I see no just reason.
('53', 371, 1, 8, 716434) The Government cannot for ever sit on the fence.

('53', 371, 3, 11, 716556) LONDON, September 17, 1931
('53', 371, 4, 12, 716583) LORD CHANCELLOR, It is not without very great hesitation that I take part in this debate on Head 2 1; and, before I proceed to deal with the several points that are noted down here for discussion, I should like, with your per mission, to disburden myself of an oppressive feeling that has been grow ing on me ever since Monday.
('53', 371, 4, 13, 716911) I have watched with the greatest attention the discussions that have taken place in this Committee.
('53', 371, 4, 14, 717011) I have endea voured to study, as I have not done before, the list of the Delegates; and the first feeling of oppression that has been coming upon me is that we are not the chosen ones of the nation which we should be representing, but we are the chosen ones of the Government.
('53', 371, 4, 15, 717288) I see, as I study the list and as I know the different parties and groups in India from experience, some very noticeable gaps also; and so I am oppressed with a sense of unreality in connection with our composition.
('53', 371, 4, 16, 717504) My second reason for feeling a sense of unreality is that these proceedings seem to me to be interminable and to be leading us practically nowhere.
('53', 371, 4, 17, 717652) If we go on at this rate I do not know that we shall proceed beyond having discussed the various points raised before this Committee threadbare.
('53', 371, 4, 18, 717797) I would therefore, first of all, Lord Chancellor, tender my deepest sympathies to you for the very great patience and, may I add, the unfailing courtesy with which you are handling us; and I really congratulate you upon the great pains that you are taking over the proceedings of this Committee.
('53', 371, 4, 19, 718093) I hope that, at the end of your task and of our task, it will be possible for me to tender my congratulations
('53', 371, 5, 20, 718203) 1 Questions connected with the election of members of the Federal Legislature
('53', 372, 0, 1, 718281) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 373
('53', 372, 1, 2, 718325) on having enabled us, or even compelled us, to show some tangible result.
('53', 372, 1, 3, 718399) May I here lodge a gentle, humble complaints against His Majestys advisers?
('53', 372, 1, 4, 718475) Having brought us together from over the seas, and knowing, as I take it they do know, that we are all of us, without exception busy people, as they themselves are, and that we have left our respective posts of duty having brought us together, is it not possible for them to give us a lead?
('53', 372, 1, 5, 718766) Can I not, through you, appeal to them to let us know their mind?
('53', 372, 1, 6, 718832) I should be delighted and I feel that that would be the proper procedure, if I may venture to say so in your presence if they would bring forward concrete proposals for taking our opinion.
('53', 372, 1, 7, 719021) If some such thing was done, I have no doubt that we should be able to come to some conclusions, good or bad, satisfactory or unsatisfactory; but if we simply resolve ourselves into a debating society, each member of which gives an eloquent discourse upon the points severally raised, I do not think that we shall be serveing or advancing the purpose for which we have been brought together.
('53', 372, 1, 8, 719413) It seems to me that it might be profitable, if it is open for you, to appoint a Subcommittee to give you some points for conclusion so that our proceedings may be terminated in fair time.
('53', 372, 1, 9, 719601) I have simply ventured to throw out these suggestions for your consideration, and for the consideration of the members.
('53', 372, 1, 10, 719721) Perhaps you will kindly bring them to the notice of His Majestys advisers for their consideration.
('53', 372, 1, 11, 719820) I do want them to guide us and to give us a lead, and to place their own cards on the table.
('53', 372, 1, 12, 719913) I want them to say what they would do supposing that we appointed them as the arbiters of our destiny.
('53', 372, 1, 13, 720016) If they would be good enough to seek our advice and opinion, then we give them our advice and opinion.
('53', 372, 1, 14, 720119) That would be, in my opinion, really a better thing than this state of hopeless uncertainty and endless delay.
('53', 372, 1, 15, 720230) Having said that, I shall venture to offer a few remarks upon Head 2. There I share the difficulty that faced Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru.
('53', 372, 1, 16, 720363) If I understood him rightly, he said that he was embarrassed in that he was called upon to deal with several sub heads when he did not know what the franchise actually would be.
('53', 372, 1, 17, 720541) There is that difficulty that stares me in the face in common with him ; but there is an additional difficulty that stares me in the face.
('53', 372, 1, 18, 720680) I placed before the Committee the mandate of the Congress, and I have to discuss every one of the sub heads in terms of that mandate.
('53', 372, 1, 19, 720814) Therefore, on certain of these
('53', 373, 0, 1, 720845) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 374
('53', 373, 1, 2, 720887) sub heads, I would have to offer suggestions or my opinion in terms of that mandate; and if the Committee does not know what it is sailing for, naturally the opinion that I may offer would be of really no value to it.
('53', 373, 1, 3, 721105) The opinion would be of value only in terms of that mandate.
('53', 373, 1, 4, 721166) My meaning will be clear when I come to examine these sub heads.
('53', 373, 1, 5, 721231) With reference to sub head (i), whilst my sympathies, broadly speaking, are with Dr. Ambedkar, my reason is wholly with Mr. Gavin Jones and Sir Sultan Ahmed.
('53', 373, 1, 6, 721389) If we were a homogeneous Committee whose member were entitled to vote and come to a conclusion, I should then sail a very large distance with Dr. Ambedkar; but such is not our position.
('53', 373, 1, 7, 721575) We are an ill assorted group, each member of which is independent of the other and therefore, entitled to give his or her views unfettered by any common rule.
('53', 373, 1, 8, 721734) Hence, we have no right, in my humble opinion , to say to the States what they shall do and what they shall not do.
('53', 373, 1, 9, 721850) Those states have very generously come to our assistance and said that they would federate with us, and perhaps part with some of their rights which they might otherwise have held exclusively.
('53', 373, 1, 10, 722043) That being so, I could not but endorse the opinion given by Sir Sultan Ahmed, which was perhaps emphasized by Mr. Gavin Jones, that the utmost that we can do is to plead with the States, and show them our own difficulties.
('53', 373, 1, 11, 722266) At the same time I feel that we have to recognize their special difficulties also.
('53', 373, 1, 12, 722349) Therefore, I can only venture a suggestion or two to the great Princes for their sympathetic consideration; and I would urge this, being a man of the people, from the people, and endeavouring to represent the lowest classes of society I would urge upon them the advisability of finding a place for these also in any scheme that they may evolve and present for the acceptance of this Committee.
('53', 373, 1, 13, 722743) I feel, and I know, that they have the interests of their ryots at heart.
('53', 373, 1, 14, 722817) I know that they claim jealously to guard their interests; but they will, if all goes well, more and more come in contact with popular India, if I may so call British India; and they will want to make common cause with the inhabitants of that India, as the inhabitants of that India would want to make common cause with the Princes India.
('53', 373, 1, 15, 723156) After all, there is no vital, real division between these two Indias.
('53', 373, 1, 16, 723226) If one can divide a living body into two parts, you may divide India into two parts.
('53', 373, 1, 17, 723311) It has lived as one country from time immemorial, and no artificial boundary can possibly divide it.
('53', 373, 1, 18, 723412) The Princes, be it said to their credit, when they declared themselves frankly and courageously in favour of federation, claimed also to be of the the same blood with us claimed to be our own kith and kin.
('53', 374, 0, 1, 723618) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 375
('53', 374, 1, 2, 723662) How could they do otherwise?
('53', 374, 1, 3, 723691) There is no difference between them and us except that we are common people and they are God has made them noblemen, Princes.
('53', 374, 1, 4, 723817) I wish them well, I wish them all prosperity; and I also pray that their prosperity and their welfare may be utilized for the advancement of their own dear people, their own subjects.
('53', 374, 1, 5, 724001) Beyond this I will not go; I cannot go.
('53', 374, 1, 6, 724041) I can only make an appeal to them.
('53', 374, 1, 7, 724076) It is open to them, as we know, either to come into the Federation or not to come into it.
('53', 374, 1, 8, 724167) It is up to us to make it easy for them to come into the Federation.
('53', 374, 1, 9, 724236) It is up to them to make it easy for us to welcome them with open arms.
('53', 374, 1, 10, 724308) Without that spirit of giveandtake, I know that we shall not be able to come to any definite scheme of Federation; or, if we do, we shall ultimately quarrel and break up.
('53', 374, 1, 11, 724479) Therefore, I would rather that we did not embark upon any federal scheme, then that we should do so without our full hearts in the thing.
('53', 374, 1, 12, 724617) If we do so, we should do so whole heartedly.
('53', 374, 1, 13, 724663) Then, with reference to the second head, I see that the second head has really been considered in connection with disqualifications whether there should be any disqualifications or not.
('53', 374, 1, 14, 724849) Although I claim to be a full fledged democrat, I have no hesitation in saying that it is en tirely consistent with the rights of the voter to have some disquali fications attaching to candidature as also some disqualif ications which would unseat a member.
('53', 374, 1, 15, 725107) What they should be I do not wish to go into at the present moment; I simply say that I would endorse whole heartedly the idea and the principle of disqualification.
('53', 374, 1, 16, 725273) The words moral turpi tude do not frighten me; on the countrary I think it is a good expression.
('53', 374, 1, 17, 725370) Of course, any words that we may choose with the greatest deliberation will still cause difficulties; but what are judges for if they are not there to surmount them?
('53', 374, 1, 18, 725536) In case of difficulty, judges will come to our assistance and will say what comes under the term moral turpitude and what does not; and if, perchance, a person like myself offering civil resistance, was considered guilty of moral turpitude, I should not mind.
('53', 374, 1, 19, 725796) It may be that some people may have to suffer hardship, but on that account I am not disposed to say that there shall be no dis qualifications what soever, and that, if there were any, it would be an encroachment upon the right of the voter.
('53', 374, 1, 20, 726038) If we are to have some test or some age limit, I think we should have some character limit as well.
('53', 374, 1, 21, 726138) Then the third point is as to indirect and direct election.
('53', 374, 1, 22, 726198) I wish Lord Peel were here to find me in substantial agreement with him so far as the principle of indirect election is concerned.
('53', 374, 1, 23, 726329) I do not know I
('53', 375, 0, 1, 726345) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 376
('53', 375, 1, 2, 726387) am talking simply as a layman but the words indirect election do not frighten me.
('53', 375, 1, 3, 726469) I do not know if they have any technical meaning; if they have, I am wholly unaware of it.
('53', 375, 1, 4, 726560) I am presently going to say what I mean.
('53', 375, 1, 5, 726601) Whether it is called direct election or indirect election, I would certainly go round and plead for it, and probably get a large body of public opinion in favour of that method of election.
('53', 375, 1, 6, 726791) The method I am about to suggest is necessary because I am wedded to adult suffrage.
('53', 375, 1, 7, 726876) Somehow or other, Congressmen swear by it.
('53', 375, 1, 8, 726919) Adult suffrage is necessary for more reasons that one; and one of the decisive reasons to me is that it enables me to satisfy all the reasonable aspirations, not only of the Musslmans, but also of the so called untouchables, of Christians, of labourers and all classes.
('53', 375, 1, 9, 727189) I cannot possibly bear the idea that a man who has got wealth should have the vote, but that a man who has got character, but no wealth or literacy, should have no vote; or that a man who works honestly by the sweat of his brow day in and day out should not have the vote for the crime of being a poor man.
('53', 375, 1, 10, 727496) It is an unbearable thing; and having lived and mixed with the poorest of the villagers, and having prided myself on being considered an untouchable, I know that some of the finest specimens of humanity are to be found amongst the very untouchables themselves.
('53', 375, 1, 11, 727757) I would far rather forgo the right of voting myself than that this untouchable brother should not have the vote.
('53', 375, 1, 12, 727870) I am not enamoured of the doctrine of literacy that a voter must at least have a knowledge of the three Rs .
('53', 375, 1, 13, 727979) I want for my people a knowledge of the three Rs; but I know also that, if I have to wait until they have got knowledge of the three Rs before they can be qualified for voting, I shall have to wait until the Greek Kalneds, and I am not prepared to wait all that time.
('53', 375, 1, 14, 728247) I know millions of these men are quite capable of voting; but if we are going to give them all the vote, it will become very difficult, if not absolutely impossible, to bring them all on the voter list and have manageable constituencies.
('53', 375, 1, 15, 728485) I do share Lord Peels fear that, if we have unwieldy constituen cies, it is not possible for the candidate to come in personal touch with all this multitude of people or to keep touch with them from time to time and to take their opinion and so on.
('53', 375, 1, 16, 728734) Although I have never aspired to legislative honours, I have had something to do with these electorates and I know how difficult it has been.
('53', 375, 1, 17, 728876) I also know the experiences of those who have been members of these legislative bodies.
('53', 375, 1, 18, 728964) We in the Congress, therefore, have evolved a scheme, and though the Government of the day have accused us of insolently
('53', 376, 0, 1, 729085) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 377
('53', 376, 1, 2, 729129) setting up a parallel government, I would like to subscribe to that charge in my own fashion.
('53', 376, 1, 3, 729223) Though we have not set up any parallel government, we certainly aspire some day or other to displace the existing Government and, in due course, in the course of evolution, to take charge also of that Government.
('53', 376, 1, 4, 729436) Having been for the last fourteen years a draftsman of the Indian National Congress, and having been for nearly twenty years draftsman for a similar body 1 in South Africa, you will allow me to share my experience with you.
('53', 376, 1, 5, 729660) In the Congress constitution we have practically adult suffrage.
('53', 376, 1, 6, 729725) We impose a nominal fee of four annas a year.
('53', 376, 1, 7, 729771) I would not mind imposing that fee even now.
('53', 376, 1, 8, 729816) I again share Lord Peels fear that, in our poor country, we run the risk of having to spend a lot of money merely upon managing our elections.
('53', 376, 1, 9, 729959) I would avoid that , and therefore I would even collect this money.
('53', 376, 1, 10, 730027) I am open to conviction that even four annas would be a grave burden, in which case I would waive it; but in any case in the Congress organization we have that.
('53', 376, 1, 11, 730188) We have also another distinguishing feature.
('53', 376, 1, 12, 730233) So far as I know the working of voting stems, the registration officer has to put on the voters list all those who, he considers are entitled to the vote; and hence, whether a man wishes to vote or not whether he wants his name to come on the list or not he finds his name there.
('53', 376, 1, 13, 730513) One fine morning I found my name on the voters list in Durban in Natal.
('53', 376, 1, 14, 730585) I had no intention of affecting the legislative position there and I never cared to place my name on the roll of voters; but when some candidate wanted my vote for himself, he drew my attention to the fact that I was on the voters list; and since then, I have known that is how voters lists are prepared.
('53', 376, 1, 15, 730890) We have this alternative that he who wants the vote can have it.
('53', 376, 1, 16, 730955) It is therefore open to those who want the vote, subject to the condition regarding age and any other condition which all can fulfil, to have their names, without distinction of sex, on the voters list.
('53', 376, 1, 17, 731158) I think a scheme of that character would keep the voters list within a manageable compass.
('53', 376, 1, 18, 731249) Even so we would have millions, and something is needed to link the village with the Central Legislature.
('53', 376, 1, 19, 731355) We have some thing analogous to the Central Legislature in the Indian Congress
('53', 376, 2, 20, 731434) 1 The Natal Indian Congress, and later the Transvaal British Indian Association
('53', 377, 0, 1, 731514) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 378
('53', 377, 1, 2, 731556) Committee.
('53', 377, 1, 3, 731567) We have also provincial bodies analogous to the Provincial Legislatures, and we have also our own tin pot legislation and we have also our administration.
('53', 377, 1, 4, 731722) We have got our own executive.
('53', 377, 1, 5, 731753) It is perfectly true we have no bayonets to back it, but we have something infinitely superior to back our decisions and to get our people to conform to those decisions, and we have hitherto not found insurmountable difficulties.
('53', 377, 1, 6, 731983) I do not say that we have been able always to exact obedience fully in all circumstances; but we have been able to scrape through all these forty seven years, and year after year this Congress has grown from height to height.
('53', 377, 1, 7, 732209) Let me tell you that our provincial councils have got full authority to frame bye laws in order to govern their elections.
('53', 377, 1, 8, 732332) The corner stone, name the qualifications or voters, they cannot change at all; but all other things they can have in their own way.
('53', 377, 1, 9, 732465) Therefore, I will take only one Province where this thing is done.
('53', 377, 1, 10, 732532) There the villages elect their own little committees.
('53', 377, 1, 11, 732586) These committees elect the taluka committees (taluka is a sub district), and these taluka committees again elect the district councils, and the district councils elect provincial councils.
('53', 377, 1, 12, 732775) The provincial councils send their members to the central legislature if one may so dub this All India Congress Committee.
('53', 377, 1, 13, 732898) That is how we have been able to do it.
('53', 377, 1, 14, 732938) If here we do some such thing, I do not mind.
('53', 377, 1, 15, 732984) But take another way.
('53', 377, 1, 16, 733006) We must remember that we have 700,000 villages.
('53', 377, 1, 17, 733054) I believe that the 700,000 includes the Princes India also.
('53', 377, 1, 18, 733114) I speak subject to correction.
('53', 377, 1, 19, 733145) We have perhaps 500,000 or a little more in popular India.
('53', 377, 1, 20, 733204) We may have these 500,000 units.
('53', 377, 1, 21, 733237) Each unit would elect its own representative, and these representatives would be the electorate that would elect, if you will, representatives to the Central or the Federal Legislature.
('53', 377, 1, 22, 733423) I have simply given you an outline of the scheme.
('53', 377, 1, 23, 733473) It can be filled in if it commends itself to our attention.
('53', 377, 1, 24, 733533) If we are going to have adult suffrage, I am afraid that we shall have to fall back upon a scheme somewhat after the style that I have suggested to you.
('53', 377, 1, 25, 733686) Wherever it has been working, I can only give you my evidence that it has worked with excellent results, and there has been no difficulty in establishing contact through these respective representatives with the humblest villagers.
('53', 377, 1, 26, 733918) The machinery has worked smoothly; and, where people have worked it honestly, it has worked expeditiously, and certainly without any expense worth naming.
('53', 377, 1, 27, 734073) Under this scheme I cannot conceive the possibility of a candidate having to spend Rs. 60,000 over an election, or even one lakh.
('53', 377, 1, 28, 734203) I know of some cases in which the expenses have run to one lakh of rupees in my opinion, an atrocious

('53', 378, 1, 2, 734349) figure for the poorest country in the world.
('53', 378, 2, 3, 734394) Whilst I am upon this, I would like to give you my opinion, for what it may be worth, in connection with bicameral Legislatures.
('53', 378, 2, 4, 734523) I find myself, if it would not offend your susceptibilities, in Mr. Johshis company.
('53', 378, 2, 5, 734608) I am certainly not enamoured of and I do not swear by two Houses of Legislature.
('53', 378, 2, 6, 734689) I have no fear of a popular Legislature running away with itself and hastily passing some laws of which afterwards it will have to repent.
('53', 378, 2, 7, 734828) I would not like to give a bad name to, and then hang the popular Legislature.
('53', 378, 2, 8, 734907) I think that a popular Legislature can take care of itself; and, since I am now thinking of the poorest country in the world, the less expenses we have to bear the better it is for us.
('53', 378, 2, 9, 735092) I do not for one moment endorse the idea that, unless we have an Upper Chamber to exercise some control over the popular Chamber, the popular Chamber will ruin the country.
('53', 378, 2, 10, 735265) I have no such fear; but I can visualize a state of affairs when there can be a battle royal between a popular Chamber and an Upper Chamber.
('53', 378, 2, 11, 735406) Anyway, whilst I would not take up a decisive attitude in connection with it, personally I am firmly of opinion that we can do with one Chamber only and that we can do with it to great advantage.
('53', 378, 2, 12, 735602) We will certainly save a great deal of expense if we can bring ourselves to believe that we shall do with one Chamber.
('53', 378, 2, 13, 735721) I find myself in agreement whole heartedly with Lord Peel that we need not worry ourselves about precedents.
('53', 378, 2, 14, 735830) We shall set a new precedent ourselves.
('53', 378, 2, 15, 735870) After all we are a continent.
('53', 378, 2, 16, 735900) There is no such thing as absolute similarity between any two human living institutions.
('53', 378, 2, 17, 735989) We have our own peculiar circumstances, and we have our idiosyn crasies.
('53', 378, 2, 18, 736062) I do feel that we shall have in many ways to strike out a new path for ourselves irrespective of precedents.
('53', 378, 2, 19, 736171) Therefore, I feel that we would not go wrong if we tried the method of having one Chamber only.
('53', 378, 2, 20, 736267) Make it as perfect as human ingenuity can, by all means; but be satisfied with only one Chamber.
('53', 378, 2, 21, 736364) Holding these views, I do not need to say more about sub heads (iii) and (iv).
('53', 378, 3, 22, 736443) I come to sub head (v)representation by special constituencies of special interests.
('53', 378, 3, 23, 736528) I here speak for the Congress.
('53', 378, 3, 24, 736559) The Congress has reconciled itself to special treatment of the Hindu Muslim Sikh tangle.
('53', 378, 3, 25, 736648) There are sound historical reasons for it, but the Congress will not extend that doctrine in any shape or form.
('53', 378, 3, 26, 736760) I listened to the list of
('53', 378, 4, 27, 736786) 1 Sub head (iii) concerned relations between the two Chambers of the Federal Legislature and sub head (iv) distribution of financial resources between the Federation and its units.
('53', 379, 0, 1, 736967) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 380
('53', 379, 1, 2, 737009) special interests.
('53', 379, 1, 3, 737028) So far as the untouchables are concerned, I have not yet quite grasped what Dr. Ambedkar has to say; but, of course, the Congress will share the honour with Dr. Ambedkar of representing the interests of the untouchables.
('53', 379, 1, 4, 737249) They are as dear to the Congress at the interests of any other body or of any other individual throughout the length and breadth of India.
('53', 379, 1, 5, 737388) Therefore, I would most strongly resist any further special representation.
('53', 379, 1, 6, 737464) Under adult suffrage, certainly, labour units, and so on, do not require any special representation; landlords most decidedly not, and I will give you my reason.
('53', 379, 1, 7, 737626) There is no desire on the part of the Congress, and there is no desire on the part of these dumb paupers, to dispossess landlords of their possessions; but they would have landlords to act as trustees for their tenants.
('53', 379, 1, 8, 737846) I think that it should be a matter of pride for the landlords to feel that their ryots, these millions of villagers, would prefer them as their candidates and as their representatives than others coming from other parts or someone from among themselves.
('53', 379, 1, 9, 738100) Therefore, what will happen is that the landlords will have to make common cause with the ryots; and what can be nobler, what can be better than that they should do so?
('53', 379, 1, 10, 738269) But, if the landlords insisted on special treatment and special representation in either Chamber, if there are two Chambers, or in the one popular Chamber, I am afraid that they would be really throwing the apple of discord into our midst; and I am hoping that no such claim will be put forward on behalf of the landlords or any such interest.
('53', 379, 1, 11, 738613) Then I come to my friends the Europeans, whom naturally Mr. Gavin Jones claims to represent.
('53', 379, 1, 12, 738706) But I would suggest to him humbly that hitherto they have been the privileged class they have received the protection that this foreign Government could give, and they have received it liberally.
('53', 379, 1, 13, 738902) If they would now make common cause with the masses of India, they would not be afriad, as Mr. Gavin Jones said he was afraid.
('53', 379, 1, 14, 739029) He read from some document : I have not read it.
('53', 379, 1, 15, 739078) It may be that some Indians also may say, Oh yes, if Europeans, Englishmen, want to be elected by us, we are not going to elect them; but I would undertake to take Mr. Gavin Jones throughout the length and breadth of India and show to him that he will be preferred to an Indian if he will make common cause with us.
('53', 379, 1, 16, 739394) Take Charlie Andrews.
('53', 379, 1, 17, 739416) I assure you that he will be elected a delegate in any constituency in India without the slightest difficulty.
('53', 379, 1, 18, 739527) Ask him whether he has not been received throughout the length and breadth of India with open arms.
('53', 379, 1, 19, 739627) I could multiply those instances.
('53', 379, 1, 20, 739661) I have appealed to
('53', 380, 0, 1, 739680) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 381
('53', 380, 1, 2, 739724) the Europeans to try once in a while to live on the goodwill of the poeple, and not seek to have their interests specially safeguarded or protected.
('53', 380, 1, 3, 739873) If I might venture a suggestion, safeguards would be the wrong way to go about the business.
('53', 380, 1, 4, 739966) Let them live in India as one of us that is how I would want them to live, and how I would beseech them to live.
('53', 380, 1, 5, 740079) In any case, I do feel that, in any scheme that the Congress can be party to, there is no room for the protection of special interests.
('53', 380, 1, 6, 740215) The special interests are automatically protected when you have got adult suffrage.
('53', 380, 1, 7, 740299) So far as the Christians are concerned, if I may cite the testimony of one who is no longer with us, I know that he said: We want no special protection.
('53', 380, 1, 8, 740452) And I have letters from Christian organizations saying that they want no special protection, that the special protection that they would get ,would be by right of humble service.
('53', 380, 1, 9, 740631) Then, are any special qualifications to be laid down for eligibility for membership of the Upper House?
('53', 380, 1, 10, 740735) As you know my opinion about the Upper House, I do not need to give any opinion about that.
('53', 380, 1, 11, 740827) Now I come to a very delicate point that is, the Oath of Allegiance.
('53', 380, 1, 12, 740896) I would not be able to give any opinion just now, because I want to know what the status is to be.
('53', 380, 1, 13, 740995) If it is to be complete freedom, if it is to be complete independence for India, the Oath of Allegiance naturally will be of one character.
('53', 380, 1, 14, 741135) If it is to be a subject India, then I have no place there.
('53', 380, 1, 15, 741195) Therefore, it is not possible for me today to give any opinion upon the question of the Oath of Allegiance.
('53', 380, 1, 16, 741303) Then the last question: what provision, if any, shall be made in each Chamber for nominated members?
('53', 380, 1, 17, 741404) Well, in the scheme that the Congressmen have adumbrated, there is no room for nominated members.
('53', 380, 1, 18, 741502) I can understand experts coming, or men whose advice might be sought.
('53', 380, 1, 19, 741572) They would give their advice and they would retire.
('53', 380, 1, 20, 741624) I cannot see the slightest justification for clothing them with votes.
('53', 380, 1, 21, 741695) Votes are given only by popular representatives if we want to have a democratic institution undiluted.
('53', 380, 1, 22, 741798) Therefore, I cannot possibly endorse a scheme where there are nominated members.
('53', 380, 1, 23, 741879) But that brings me back to sub head (v).
('53', 380, 1, 24, 741920) We have provision in the Congress regarding special cases.
('53', 380, 1, 25, 741979) We want women to be elected, we want Europeans to be elected, we certainly want untouchables to be
('53', 381, 0, 1, 742078) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 382
('53', 381, 1, 2, 742120) elected, we want Christians to be elected; and I know well enough that these are very large minorities.
('53', 381, 1, 3, 742224) Now, supposing that the constituencies so misbehave themselves as not to elect women or Europeans or untouchables or, say, landlords, and they do not do so for no reasonable justification whatsoever, I would have a clause in the constitution which would enable this elected Legislature to elect those who should have been elected, but have not been elected.
('53', 381, 1, 4, 742582) Perhaps I have not been able to express my meaning clearly, so I will give you an illustration.
('53', 381, 1, 5, 742678) We have in one provincial Congress council exactly a rule of this character.
('53', 381, 1, 6, 742755) We have thrown the burden upon the constituencies of electing so many women, so many Mussalmans and so many untouchables to the council; and, if they fail to do so, the election is then conducted by this elected body.
('53', 381, 1, 7, 742973) They elect those who have been unjustly left out by the electorate.
('53', 381, 1, 8, 743041) I would welcome some such saving clause in order that constituencies may not misbehave themselves; but, in the first instance, I would trust the constituencies to elect all classes of people and not become clannish or be caste ridden.
('53', 381, 1, 9, 743276) The Congress mentality, I may assure you, is wholly and absolutely against caste and against the doctrine of superiority and inferiority.
('53', 381, 1, 10, 743414) Congress is cultivating a spirit of absolute equality.
('53', 381, 1, 11, 743469) I am sorry for having taken so much of your time, but I am thankful to you for having given me this indulgence, Lord Sankey.
('53', 381, 2, 12, 743594) SIR SULTAN AHMED : I have a question I want to put to Mr. Gandhi, if you will
('53', 381, 3, 13, 743672) permit me to do so.
('53', 381, 3, 14, 743692) He suggested that, if the requisite number of people for any
('53', 381, 4, 15, 743753) particular community were not elected, then he would have the power of election
('53', 381, 5, 16, 743833) given to some other body.
('53', 381, 6, 17, 743859) MR. GANDHI : No, it is those people who are elected, who will elect.
('53', 381, 7, 18, 743928) MR. IYENGAR : Co option.
('53', 381, 8, 19, 743953) MR. GANDHI: Call it co option.
('53', 381, 8, 20, 743984) As a layman, you would not expect me to use accurate language, please.
('53', 381, 9, 21, 744055) SIR SULTAN AHMED: But does that not imply that there will be reservation of
('53', 381, 10, 22, 744131) seats for communities ?
('53', 381, 11, 23, 744155) MR. GANDHI : It need not.
('53', 381, 11, 24, 744181) As I say, there can be a clause of that kind, without specifying the number; but I do not mind even the
('53', 381, 12, 25, 744285) 1 At this point Lord Sankey left the chair, which was taken by Lord Lothian.
('53', 382, 0, 1, 744362) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 383
('53', 382, 1, 2, 744406) numbers being specified.
('53', 382, 1, 3, 744431) And you will please remember that that did not refer to the Mussalmans at all.
('53', 382, 2, 4, 744510) SIR SULTAN AHMED : No, I am not talking about Mussalmans at all; I am talking
('53', 382, 3, 5, 744588) about those four classes whom you mentioned: Commerce, Labour, Landlords, and so
('53', 382, 4, 6, 744669) It is nothing to do with Mussalmans at all; they do not come into it.
('53', 382, 5, 7, 744739) SUBBARAYAN : May I also respectfully ask Mahatma Gandhi a question?
('53', 382, 6, 8, 744807) You referred to the position of women.
('53', 382, 6, 9, 744846) Suppose the Central Legislature does not have
('53', 382, 7, 10, 744892) any women on it, then you will have a clause to allow that Legislature to co opt
('53', 382, 8, 11, 744973) women ?
('53', 382, 9, 12, 744981) MR. GANDHI : I would boycott that Legislature.
('53', 382, 9, 13, 745028) A Legislature that will not elect a proper share of women will be boycotted by me, and I speak for the Congress also.
('53', 382, 9, 14, 745146) There would certainly be full protection.
('53', 382, 9, 15, 745188) How it can be brought about is incredibly simple; but I would be no party to a setting up of special constituencies.
('53', 382, 10, 16, 745305) SUBBARAYAN : Not special constituencies; but supposing women do not
('53', 382, 11, 17, 745373) come in by general election, then you will allow the Central Legislature to elect some
('53', 382, 12, 18, 745460) women ?
('53', 382, 13, 19, 745468) MR. GANDHI : Then they have got to enjoy the honour of being elected by the elected legislators, before they can conduct their proceedings.
('53', 382, 14, 20, 745608) SIR AKBAR HYDARI : May I ask one question?
('53', 382, 14, 21, 745651) With regard to the 500,000
('53', 382, 15, 22, 745678) villages or electorates, would they elect first to the Provincial Councils and then the
('53', 382, 16, 23, 745766) Provincial Councils elect to the Federal Legislature; or would you have separate
('53', 382, 17, 24, 745847) electorates for the Provincial Council and the Federal Legislature ?
('53', 382, 18, 25, 745916) MR. GANDHI: May I suggest, Sir, in the first instance, in answer to Sir Akbar Hydari, that if you accept the general outline of the scheme that I have adumbrated, all these things can really be settled without the slightest difficulty; but the special question that Sir Akbar has asked I will answer by saying that the villages will be electing candidates to no legislature in the scheme that I was trying to propound, but they will elect the electors, the votersthe villagers will elect one man, and say, You will exercise the vote for us. He will become their agent for the election either to the Provincial Legislature or to the Central Legislature.
('53', 382, 19, 26, 746569) SIR AKBAR HYDARI : Then that man would have a dual capacity, either to elect a
('53', 382, 20, 27, 746648) man to the Provincial Council or to the Central Legislature ?
('53', 383, 0, 1, 746710) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 384
('53', 383, 1, 2, 746752) MR. GANDHI: He can have that; but today, to the relevant, I was talking simply of the election to the Central Legislature.
('53', 383, 1, 3, 746875) I would certainly apply the same scheme to the Provincial Legislature.
('53', 383, 2, 4, 746946) SIR AKBAR HYDARI : Would you rule out any idea of the Provincial Legislature so elected electing to the Federal Legislature ?
('53', 383, 3, 5, 747072) MR. GANDHI: I do not rule it out, but that does not commend itself to me.
('53', 383, 3, 6, 747146) If that is the special meaning of indirect election, I rule it out.
('53', 383, 3, 7, 747214) Therefore, I use the term indirect election vaguely.
('53', 383, 3, 8, 747267) If it has any such technical meaning, I do not know.
('53', 383, 4, 9, 747320) H. H. THE MAHARAJA GAEKWAR OR BARODA : That is the line on which we are
('53', 383, 5, 10, 747392) working.
('53', 383, 6, 11, 747401) MR. GANDHI : I know Your Highnesss scheme.
('53', 383, 7, 12, 747444) H. H. THE MAHARAJA GAEKWAR OF BARODA : The object being that each
('53', 383, 8, 13, 747510) individual, irrespective of class or creed, should be able to vote.
('53', 383, 9, 14, 747578) MR. GANDHI: Yes, I know.

('53', 384, 2, 3, 747808) KINGSLEY HALL, S.W.E. 3, September 18, 1931
('53', 384, 3, 4, 747852) DEAR FRIEND, Your air mail letter of the 4th came to me as a great relief.
('53', 384, 3, 5, 747927) The same mail brought me letters from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru informing me of your very kind letters to them.
('53', 384, 3, 6, 748066) All this makes my burden easy and I thank you for it.
('53', 384, 3, 7, 748120) I thank you too for giving prompt attention to my letter regarding Dr. Ansari and Seths Jamal Mohammad and Birla.
('53', 384, 3, 8, 748234) I suppose, in due course I shall hear from S.O.S. 1 also.
('53', 384, 3, 9, 748292) I understand what you say about Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan and appreciate the frankness with which you have written about him.
('53', 384, 3, 10, 748416) But I am hoping that your judgment will prove [to] have been unjustified by events.
('53', 384, 3, 11, 748500) You, perhaps, do not know that he has limited knowledge of English.
('53', 384, 3, 12, 748568) He cannot write letters coherently in English and he has to get assistance.
('53', 384, 3, 13, 748644) All the same I recognize the ludicrousness of his secretary writing to your secretary to arrange an appointment.
('53', 384, 3, 14, 748757) But I would like you still to have a corner in your heart for Abdul Ghaffar Khan.
('53', 384, 3, 15, 748839) I have found him to be thoroughly trustworthy and a good worker.
('53', 384, 3, 16, 748904) I fully share your sorrow over the Chittagong murder and am doing all I can to wean the mad youths from their error.
('53', 384, 3, 17, 749021) I am glad to be able to tell you that I have received from all classes of people nothing but genuine kindness.
('53', 384, 3, 18, 749132) As you know, I am deliberately living in the East End of London, and in an institution which is designed for the service of the working classes living in the East End.
('53', 384, 3, 19, 749300) I therefore come in daily contact with simple poor people, and it is a matter of joy to me to see them greeting me.
('53', 384, 3, 20, 749416) I do not at all feel that I am in the midst of strangers.
('53', 384, 3, 21, 749474) For the rest, it is too early for me yet to say anything.

('53', 385, 5, 6, 749770) [After September 18, 1931]
('53', 385, 6, 7, 749797) DEAR FRIEND, I thank you for your letter.
('53', 385, 6, 8, 749839) If and when India comes to her own, it does not follow that the British Indian Tea Estates, or any other British interests, will be confiscated.
('53', 385, 6, 9, 749984) On the contrary, every legitimate interest will receive the fullest protection, but the legitimacy of all foreign and other interests will certainly by examined by an impartial Tribunal.

('53', 385, 8, 11, 750201) 427. WHAT I WANT
('53', 385, 9, 12, 750218) The Editor has kindly asked me to say in these columns what I want.
('53', 385, 9, 13, 750286) The title is a misnomer.
('53', 385, 9, 14, 750311) I am here merely as an agent for the Indian National Congress, and I can want nothing apart from the Congress.
('53', 385, 9, 15, 750422) What I want, therefore, means what the Indian National Congress wants.
('53', 385, 9, 16, 750493) Let me then introduce my principal, the Indian National Congress, to the reader.
('53', 385, 9, 17, 750574) It is perhaps the oldest political organizaton in India and claims to represent the whole of India.
('53', 385, 9, 18, 750674) I know that some people would deny this claim.
('53', 385, 9, 19, 750721) I can only say that it is made by right of service.
('53', 385, 9, 20, 750773) The Indian National Congress is over forty seven years old.
('53', 385, 9, 21, 750833) It was conceived by an Englishman, Allan Octavius Hume.
('53', 385, 9, 22, 750889) It has had, besides Hindus, Mohammedan, Parsi and Christian presidents.
('53', 385, 9, 23, 750961) It had two women as presidents, Dr. Annie Besant and Mrs. Sarojini Naidu.
('53', 385, 9, 24, 751035) It has zamindars, too, as its members.
('53', 385, 9, 25, 751074) The Indian National Congress is no respector of persons.
('53', 385, 10, 26, 751131) 1 Editor of the Tea and Coffee Trade Journal of New York.
('53', 385, 10, 27, 751189) In a letter dated September 18 he had asked how Gandhijis plans fo a free India were likely to affect the tea industry.
('53', 386, 0, 1, 751309) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 387
('53', 386, 1, 2, 751353) knows no distinction between classes or creeds of the sexes.
('53', 386, 1, 3, 751414) It has always championed the cause of the so called untouchables, and has of recent years appointed an anti untouchability committee for hastening the destruction of untouchability.
('53', 386, 1, 4, 751596) But the unchallenged and unchallengeable claim of the Indian National Congress consists in its representing the millions of dumb paupers living in the seven hundred thousand Indian villages who constitute over 85 per cent of the population.
('53', 386, 1, 5, 751837) It is in the name of this great organization that I claim : (1) Complete independence for India.
('53', 386, 1, 6, 751934) (2) This does not exclude partnership at will and on terms of absolute equality.
('53', 386, 1, 7, 752015) (3) Nor does this exclude Federation or such safeguards as may be demonstrably necessary in the interest of India.
('53', 386, 1, 8, 752130) I hope the readers of The Daily Mail will not be frightened by the claim boldly put forth on behalf of the Congress.
('53', 386, 1, 9, 752247) Do unto others as you would that others should do unto you. On the strength of the wise saying nineteen hundred years old, I hope that Englishmen and English women will not grudge India the freedom which she has remained without by reason of British rule.
('53', 386, 1, 10, 752503) No reason should be necessary for a self evident truth.
('53', 386, 1, 11, 752559) Indepen dence is every nations birthright.
('53', 386, 1, 12, 752602) It is Indias also.
('53', 386, 1, 13, 752621) But it may not be out of place to mention here that the people of India under British rule have become progressively poor and emasculate.
('53', 386, 1, 14, 752759) The village industry has been killed and a whole nation has been disarmed.
('53', 386, 1, 15, 752834) Nothing less than complete freedom in every sense of the term can make India happy and strong.

('53', 386, 4, 18, 752998) September 19, 1931
('53', 386, 5, 19, 753017) Seated on the floor in the centre of the hall at Kingsley Settlement yesterday afternoon, Mr. Gandhi gave a special and strictly private reception to a group of youngsters, none of whom was over twelve, from among the children of Bow.
('53', 386, 5, 20, 753252) Grown ups were strictly excluded with the exception of one or two of Miss Lesters helpers, and the genial figures of Mr. and Mrs. George Lansbury and the dignified Prime

('53', 387, 1, 2, 753464) Minister of Bhavnagar, Sir Prabhashankar Pattani.
('53', 387, 1, 3, 753514) But immediately after the meeting (writes a correspondent) Mr. Gandhi himself told me all about it.
('53', 387, 1, 4, 753614) Questions about the weather in India, about the games the Indian children played, and so on, led to one child asking about the language I spoke.
('53', 387, 1, 5, 753759) This gave me just the opportunity I wanted, and I began talking about the common source of many of our words.
('53', 387, 1, 6, 753869) I took pater, father, and the Hindu pita; and mater, mother, and our own mata.
('53', 387, 1, 7, 753948) When I asked what that showed, they called out, It shows, we are all of the same breed. Then we are all one family and ought to be friends, I said, and they agreed.
('53', 387, 1, 8, 754113) I then asked if any of the boys hit back, and ten or twelve brave boys put their hands up.
('53', 387, 1, 9, 754204) So this gave me a chance for a little lesson in the principle of non violence, and I asked what they really should have done instead.
('53', 387, 1, 10, 754338) Make friends, they replied, and I told them to remember this.
('53', 387, 1, 11, 754400) I do like the London children so much and it has been so delightful to meet them both here and in some of their homes which I visited this morning.
('53', 387, 2, 12, 754548) As a result of this meeting, some of the children expressed their determination to send a little deputation to Mr. Gandhi with a message of friendship to the children of India.

('53', 388, 3, 5, 755411) [After September 19, 1931] Thanks for letter.
('53', 388, 3, 6, 755457) It is too premature at present to envisage a visit to Germany.
('53', 388, 4, 7, 755520) From a photostat: S.N. 17798
('53', 388, 5, 8, 755549) 431. GUJARAT KHADI
('53', 388, 6, 9, 755568) If Gujarat does not use Gujarats khadi, who else will?
('53', 388, 6, 10, 755623) If the Gujaratis cast aside Gujarat khadi saying that it is coarse, not durable and expensive, who else will use it and why should they?
('53', 388, 6, 11, 755760) It is through similar pretexts that religions have perished, countries have been ruined, and men have suffered a downfall.
('53', 388, 6, 12, 755883) If you find Gujarats khadi rough and coarse, have it produced find and smooth.
('53', 388, 6, 13, 755962) If it is expensive, it will certainly become cheap if larger quantities of it are sold.
('53', 388, 6, 14, 756050) Everyone knows that khadi made in Gujarat today is finer, more durable and cheaper than it was ten years ago.
('53', 388, 6, 15, 756160) Its quality will improve even more if its sales are larger.
('53', 388, 6, 16, 756220) Whether this improvement takes place or not rests entirely with the Gujaratis themselves.
('53', 388, 6, 17, 756310) The latter can reject it by regarding it as expensive or, alternatively, they can accept it by looking upon it as something belonging to them despite its high price and, by doing so, bring about an improvement in its quality and variety, beautify it, and make it even inexpensive.
('53', 388, 6, 18, 756591) With this worthy objective, a devotee of khadi suggests that the Provincial Committee should celebrate a Gujarat Khadi Week.
('53', 388, 6, 19, 756716) During that week, the Committee should collect khadi from all those places where stock have accumulated and men and women volunteers should go from door to door and sell it.
('53', 388, 6, 20, 756890) The total quantity of khadi produced in Gujarat is so small that, if it means it, Ahmedabad alone can buy it up.
('53', 388, 6, 21, 757003) It is not for me to say how the Week should be celebrated.
('53', 388, 7, 22, 757062) 1 The addressee in his letter of September 19 had urged Gandhiji to pay a visit to Germany on his way back home.
('53', 389, 0, 1, 757175) 390 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 389, 1, 2, 757217) having collected all the khadi and paying up the respective dues to the various production centres, the Committee should add up the entire amount and find out the average price, and then sell it without incurring any loss.
('53', 389, 1, 3, 757440) Selling it at a loss would be business practice.
('53', 389, 1, 4, 757489) Here the question is not one of business but of patriotism.
('53', 389, 1, 5, 757549) Patriotism can pay any price.
('53', 389, 1, 6, 757579) Just as a mother does not regard her children as expensive or ugly and abandon them but sacrifices herself for their sake, similarly, even if Gujarat does something of this sort, that will be enough.
('53', 389, 1, 7, 757779) Gujarat does not have to sacrifice itself, it may perhaps have to pay a slightly higher price.
('53', 389, 1, 8, 757874) The second suggestion made by the devotee of khadi is that workers in Gujarat should use only khadi made in Gujarat.
('53', 389, 1, 9, 757991) Many other ways of improving the sales of khadi in Gujarat can be thought of, only one must be earnest about it.
('53', 389, 1, 10, 758104) Where there is a will, there is certainly a way.

('53', 389, 4, 14, 758248) In the course of the interview we touched on his attitude to Britain.
('53', 389, 4, 15, 758318) He said : I do not hate the British, but I hate British rule.
('53', 389, 5, 16, 758380) Gandhi did not think that the withdrawal of the British officials from India would be a very serious difficulty, though some of them could remain if they liked, but, he explained, on our terms.
('53', 389, 5, 17, 758574) I asked whether he approved of Indians taking posts under British rule with the view of gaining experience in the work of government, and Gandhi replied that, in the days of non co operation he had, of course, advised against it, and that so far as the experience was concerned, it was of no great value.
('53', 389, 5, 18, 758879) On the subject of the efficiency of the British officials in India, he remarked : They are efficient in their own way and for their own interest.
('53', 389, 6, 19, 759025) From further questions it appeared that Gandhi referred only to the ac tions of the officials in the working of the existing system.
('53', 389, 6, 20, 759158) Even so, however, I felt that more
('53', 389, 7, 21, 759193) 1 The interview was held in London on a Sunday morning.
('53', 389, 7, 22, 759249) Gandhiji was away from London the four Sundays previous to the publication of the interview, which would seem to leave September 20 as the likely date.

('53', 390, 1, 2, 759445) light on the point would be useful, and I said : You have frequently criticized British officials in land assessment and other cases.
('53', 390, 1, 3, 759579) Do youthink that the reports you have challenged from time to time were consciously misleading ? Gandhi returned : No, or very rarely were they consciously wrong.
('53', 390, 1, 4, 759742) But injustice is done, and it doesnt matter to the patient if he is killed through design or merey through ignorance or accident.
('53', 390, 2, 5, 759872) The interview terminated with the repetition of two phrases Gandhiji had previously used.
('53', 390, 2, 6, 759962) I wish all nations the freedom that I desire for India, and, in my opinion, the freedom of India means the freedom of the world.

('53', 390, 6, 10, 760164) Gandhi will do nothing for the Meerut prisoners.
('53', 390, 6, 11, 760213) 2 He dismisses their case with the remark that they were not included in the amnesty which followed his Agreement with the Viceroy, because they were not non violent.
('53', 390, 6, 12, 760380) This transpired at a meeting in London between Gandhi and Mrs. Knight, the mother of Lester Hutchinson, one of the Meerut prisoners who have been released on bail and is now lying seriously ill as a result of his suffering in jail.
('53', 390, 6, 13, 760612) Gandhi added that, though he knew Hutchinson was seriously ill, he could do nothing for him.
('53', 390, 6, 14, 760705) Asked whether he could not raise the question of the Meerut trial at the Round Table Conference, he replied that he could not, since the proceedings of the Conference were secret and private.

('53', 390, 7, 16, 760925) 1 The report concluded: Despite his smallness and frailness, he is imposing; and such personal magnetism has hitherto been outside my experience.
('53', 390, 7, 17, 761071) The humble man is impregnable; that I have often repeated; but only now do I realize the truth of the remark.
('53', 390, 7, 18, 761181) Gandhis humility is a thing for tears. 2 At the instance of the District Magistrate of Meerut twenty eight trade union leaders were arrested in Calcutta, Madras, Lucknow, Poona, Chandpur and Allahabad under Sec.

('53', 390, 7, 20, 761476) The trial lasted more than 4 1/2 years and resulted in the conviction of many.
('53', 390, 7, 21, 761555) The motive, according to Gandhiji, was to strike terror.

('53', 391, 3, 6, 761817) Mahadev, Pyarelal, Devdas and Mirabehn are with me.
('53', 391, 3, 7, 761869) The cold here is still bearable.
('53', 391, 3, 8, 761902) But the work has turned out to be heavier than I had thought.
('53', 391, 3, 9, 761964) I cannot say what the outcome will be.
('53', 391, 3, 10, 762003) I shall be here for at least a month longer.
('53', 391, 3, 11, 762048) I got Manilals cable a little late.
('53', 391, 3, 12, 762084) It is natural that you two should wish to come here, but it is best that you should restrain the wish.
('53', 391, 3, 13, 762187) Staying with me, you would not be able to tour and see this country well, and the expense, I think, would be much too heavy and beyond our means.
('53', 391, 3, 14, 762333) Jayashankars death was a release to him from his pain.
('53', 391, 3, 15, 762388) It would be very good if the two brothers settled down there.

('53', 392, 5, 12, 763634) LONDON, September 22, 1931
('53', 392, 6, 13, 763661) Gandhiji had not heard of him, but he had evidently heard of Gandhijis spinning wheel and the very first question he asked was why Gandhiji was against machinery.
('53', 392, 6, 14, 763824) The question delighted Gandhiji who explained to him in detail why the six months unemployment of the whole peasant population of India made it important for him to restore them to their former subsidiary industry.
('53', 392, 7, 15, 764039) CHARLIE CHAPLIN: Is it then only as regards cloth?
('53', 392, 8, 16, 764090) GANDHIJI : Precisely.
('53', 392, 8, 17, 764112) In cloth and food every nation should be self contained.
('53', 392, 8, 18, 764169) We were self contained and want to be that again.
('53', 392, 8, 19, 764219) England with their large scale production has to look for a market elsewhere.
('53', 392, 8, 20, 764297) We call it exploitation.
('53', 392, 8, 21, 764322) And an exploiting England is a danger to the world, but if that is so, how much more so would be an exploiting India, if she took to machinery and produced cloth many times in excess of its requirements.
('53', 392, 9, 22, 764526) CHARLIE CHAPLIN: So the question is confined only to India?
('53', 392, 9, 23, 764586) But supposing you had in India the independence of Russia, and you could find other work for our

('53', 393, 1, 3, 764998) You would subscribe to shorter hours of work and more leisure for the worker?
('53', 393, 1, 4, 765076) GANDHIJI : Certainly.
('53', 393, 2, 5, 765098) CHARLIE CHAPLIN: Naturally I am in sympathy with Indias aspirations and struggle for freedom.
('53', 393, 2, 6, 765192) Nonetheless, I am somewhat confused by your abhorrence of machinery.
('53', 393, 3, 7, 765261) GANDHIJI : I understand.
('53', 393, 3, 8, 765286) But before India can achieve those aims, she must first rid herself of English rule.
('53', 393, 3, 9, 765371) Machinery in the past has made us dependent on England, and the only way we can rid ourselves of the dependence is to boycott all goods made by machinery.
('53', 393, 3, 10, 765526) That is why we have made it the patriotic duty of every Indian to spin his own cotton and weave his own cloth.
('53', 393, 3, 11, 765637) This is our form of attacking a very powerul nation like England and, of course, there are other reasons.
('53', 393, 3, 12, 765743) India has a diffrent climate from England; and her habits and wants are different.
('53', 393, 3, 13, 765826) In England the cold weather necessitates arduous industry and an involved economy.
('53', 393, 3, 14, 765909) You need the industry of eating utensils; we use our fingers.

('53', 393, 7, 20, 766436) Every thoughtful Congressman must sympathize with the British nation in the crisis that has overtaken it; but I would be false to my trust if I did not express my surprise and sorrow over the manner of the action taken in India.

('53', 394, 1, 3, 767173) I must, therefore, leave the merits to the Congress experts for examination.
('53', 394, 1, 4, 767250) But what pains me is the fact that the decision in India was taken over the heads of the Legislatures, such as they are, and that especially when, in this place, we are expected to contemplate an early establishment of full responsible government.
('53', 394, 1, 5, 767498) This step taken by the Government of India is striking and, in my humble opinion, unmistakable proof of the unbend ing and unbendable attitude of the Government of India.
('53', 394, 1, 6, 767669) Evidently, on matters of the most vital importance to the nation, we are not yet considered fit to be consulted, much less to decide what is good for us.
('53', 394, 1, 7, 767823) This is a view I must repudiate with all the strength I can command; and, in the circumstances, so far as the Congress is concerned, I am sorry I am unable to give the support which the Secretary of State asks for the measures taken in India.

('53', 394, 4, 10, 768233) SIR, My attention has been called to a letter in the Manchester Guardian of Monday, September 21, calling attention to some stamps which had printed on them the words Boycott British goods.
('53', 394, 4, 11, 768423) If such stamps have been emloyed by any Congress authority after the agreement of March 5, 1931, they are clearly contrary to that agreement, which declares that only an economic boycott should be permissible in future.
('53', 394, 4, 12, 768643) But such stamps were undoubtedly used during the struggle before the agreement was reached.
('53', 394, 4, 13, 768735) The stamps in question could not have been used after the agreement.
('53', 394, 4, 14, 768804) Whenever I have found a breach of the agreement, I have immediately done all in my power to stop it.

('53', 395, 4, 6, 769201) LONDON, September 23, 1931 You will be astonished to hear from me that, although to all appearances my mission is political, I would ask you to accept my assurance that its roots areif I may use that termspiritual.
('53', 395, 4, 7, 769416) It is commonly known, though perhaps not believed, that I claim that at least my politics are not divorced from morality, from spirituality, from religion.
('53', 395, 4, 8, 769572) I have claimedand the claim is based upon extensive experiencethat a man who is trying to discover and follow the will of God cannot possibly leave a single field of life untouched.
('53', 395, 4, 9, 769754) I came also, in the course of my service, to the conclusion that if there was any field of life where morality, where truth, where fear of God, were not essential, that field should be given up entirely.
('53', 395, 4, 10, 769958) But I found also that the politics of the day are no longer a concern of kings, but that they affect the lowest strata of society.
('53', 395, 4, 11, 770089) And I found, through bitter experience that, if I wanted to do social service, I could not possibly leave politics alone.
('53', 395, 4, 12, 770211) Do not please consider that I want to speak to you tonightabout politics and somehow or other connect voluntary poverty with politics.
('53', 395, 4, 13, 770346) That is not my intention.
('53', 395, 4, 14, 770372) I have simply given you an introduction how I came to believe in the necessity of volun tary poverty for any social worker or for any political worker who wanted to remain untouched by the hideous immorality and untruth that one smells today in ordinary politics.
('53', 395, 4, 15, 770636) The stench that comes from that life has appeared to

('53', 395, 5, 18, 770833) 2 The meeting was held under the auspices of the Franciscan Society with Dr. Maude Royden in the chair.

('53', 396, 1, 2, 771016) some to be so suffocating that they came to the conclusion that politics were not for a god fearing man.
('53', 396, 1, 3, 771121) Had that been really so, I feel that it would have been a disaster for mankind.
('53', 396, 1, 4, 771201) Find out for yourselves, in the light of what I am now saying, whether directly or indirectly every activity of yours today in this one of the greatest cities of the world is not touched by politics.
('53', 396, 1, 5, 771401) Well, then, when I found myself drawn into the political coil, I asked myself what was necessary for me in order to remain abso lutely untouched by immorality, by untruth, by what is known as political gain.
('53', 396, 1, 6, 771609) In the course of my search, I made several discoveries which I must, for tonight, leave alone.
('53', 396, 1, 7, 771704) But, if I am not mistaken, this necessity for poverty came to me first of all.
('53', 396, 1, 8, 771783) I do not propose to take you through all the details of that act or performanceinteresting and, to me, sacred though they are but I can only tell you that it was a difficult struggle in the beginning and it was a wrestle with my wife and as I can vividly recall with my children also.
('53', 396, 1, 9, 772068) Be that as it may, I came definitely to the conclusion that, if I had to serve the people in whose midst my life was cast and of whose difficulties I was witness from day to day, I must discard all wealth, all possessions.
('53', 396, 1, 10, 772291) I cannot tell you with truth that, when this belief came to me, I discarded everything immediately.
('53', 396, 1, 11, 772391) I must confess to you that progress at first was slow.
('53', 396, 1, 12, 772446) And now, as I recall those days of struggle, I remember that it was also painful in the beginning.
('53', 396, 1, 13, 772545) But, as days went by, I saw that I had to throw overboard many other things which I used to consider as mine, and a time came when it became a matter of positive joy to give up those things.
('53', 396, 1, 14, 772736) And one after another then, by almost geometric progression, the things slipped away from me.
('53', 396, 1, 15, 772830) And, as I am describing my experiences, I can say a great burden fell off my shoulders, and I felt that I could now walk with ease and do my work also in the service of my fellowmen with great comfort and still greater joy.
('53', 396, 1, 16, 773054) The possession of anything then became a troublesome thing and a burden.
('53', 396, 1, 17, 773127) Exploring the cause of that joy, I found that, if I kept any thing as my own, I had to defend it against the whole world.
('53', 396, 1, 18, 773249) I found also that there were many people who did not have the thing, although they wanted it; and I would have to seek police assistance also if hungry, famine stricken people, finding me in a lonely place, wanted
('53', 397, 0, 1, 773463) 398 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 397, 1, 2, 773505) not merely to divide the thing with me but to dispossess me.
('53', 397, 1, 3, 773566) And I said to myself : if they want it and would take it, they do so not from any malicious motive, but they would do it because theirs was a greater need than mine.
('53', 397, 1, 4, 773732) And then I said to myself : possession seems to me to be a crime.
('53', 397, 1, 5, 773798) I can only possess certain things when I know that others, who also want to possess similar things, are able to do so.
('53', 397, 1, 6, 773917) But we know every one of us can speak from experience that such a thing is an impossibility.
('53', 397, 1, 7, 774010) Therefore, the only thing that can be possessed by all is non possession, not to have anything whatsoever.
('53', 397, 1, 8, 774117) In other words, a willing surrender.
('53', 397, 1, 9, 774154) You might then well say to me : but you are keeping many things on your body even as you are speaking about voluntary poverty and not possessing anything whatsoever!
('53', 397, 1, 10, 774320) And your taunt would be right, if you only superficially understood the meaning of the thing that I am speaking about just now.
('53', 397, 1, 11, 774448) It is really the spirit behind.
('53', 397, 1, 12, 774480) Whilst you have the body, you will have to have something to clothe the body with also.
('53', 397, 1, 13, 774568) But then you will take for the body not all that you can get, but the least possible, the least with which you can do.
('53', 397, 1, 14, 774687) You will take for your house not many mansions, but the least cover that you can do with.
('53', 397, 1, 15, 774777) And similarly with reference to your food and so on.
('53', 397, 1, 16, 774830) Now you see that there is here a daily conflict between what you and we understand today as civilization and the state which I am picturing to you as a state of bliss and a desirable state.
('53', 397, 1, 17, 775020) On the one hand, the basis of culture or civilization is understood to be the multiplication of all your wants.
('53', 397, 1, 18, 775132) If you have one room, you will desire to have two rooms, three rooms, the more the merrier.
('53', 397, 1, 19, 775224) And similarly, you will want to have as much furniture as you can put in your house, and so on, endlessly.
('53', 397, 1, 20, 775331) And the more you possess the better culture you represent, or some such thing.
('53', 397, 1, 21, 775410) I am putting it, perhaps, not as nicely as the advocates of that civilization would put it, but I am putting it to you in the manner I understand it.
('53', 397, 2, 22, 775560) And, on the other hand, you find the less you possess the less you want, the better you are.
('53', 397, 2, 23, 775653) And better for what?
('53', 397, 2, 24, 775674) Not for enjoyment of this life, but for enjoyment of personal service to your fellow beings; service to which you dedicate yourselves, body, soul and mind.
('53', 397, 2, 25, 775830) Well, here you find there is ample room for hypocrisy and
('53', 398, 0, 1, 775888) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 399
('53', 398, 1, 2, 775932) humbug, because a man or a woman may easily deceive himself or herself and deceive his or her neighbours also, by saying : In spirit I have given up all possessions, and yet externally I am possessing these things; you must not examine my deed, you must examine my intention; and of my intention only I must remain the sole witness. That is a trap, and a death trap.
('53', 398, 1, 3, 776299) How are you then to justify the possession even of a piece of cloth two or three or four yards, say, in length and a yard in width ?
('53', 398, 1, 4, 776432) How can you justify even the possession of that piece of cloth in order to cover your body somewhat, when you know that, if you left that piece of cloth alone, even that would be taken over by someonenot maliciously againbut because he would want it for he has not even so much as that piece of cloth?
('53', 398, 1, 5, 776734) I am witness, eyewitness, of millions of human beings who have not even so much as that piece of cloth.
('53', 398, 1, 6, 776838) How are you then to justify your act of possessing this thing with your intention not to possess anything at all?
('53', 398, 1, 7, 776952) Well, there is a remedy provided for this dilemma, this difficulty, this contradiction in lifethat if you must possess these things, you must hold them at the disposal of those who want them.
('53', 398, 1, 8, 777144) What happens is that, if somebody comes and wants your piece of cloth, you are not going to keep it from him, you are not going to shut any doors, you are certainly not going to the policeman to ask him to help you to keep these things.
('53', 398, 1, 9, 777381) And you have also got to be content with what the world will give you.
('53', 398, 1, 10, 777452) The world may give you that piece of cloth or may not because, if you do not possess anything, naturally you do not possess the token coin with which you may buy clothing or food.
('53', 398, 1, 11, 777632) You have got then to live purely on the charity of the world.
('53', 398, 1, 12, 777694) And even when charitable people give you something, that something does not become your possession.
('53', 398, 1, 13, 777794) You simply retain it with the fullest intention of that thing being surrendered to anybody who wishes to take it.
('53', 398, 1, 14, 777908) If somebody comes and uses force against you to dispossess you, you may not go and report to the next policeman you meet and say you have been assaulted.
('53', 398, 1, 15, 778062) You will not have been assaulted.
('53', 398, 1, 16, 778096) Well, that, to my mind, is the meaning of voluntary poverty.
('53', 398, 1, 17, 778157) I have given you an ideal.
('53', 398, 1, 18, 778184) Dr. Royden has claimed that I am the greatest exponent of voluntary poverty in the world.
('53', 398, 1, 19, 778274) I must, in all humility, disown any such claim whatsoever.
('53', 398, 1, 20, 778333) And this I say to you not because of false modesty, but I say it to you sincerely, believing it to
('53', 399, 0, 1, 778432) 400 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 399, 1, 2, 778474) be true.
('53', 399, 1, 3, 778483) I have given you but a little of my conception of voluntary poverty.
('53', 399, 1, 4, 778552) And I must own to you that I am far from having realized that ideal in its fullness.
('53', 399, 1, 5, 778637) In order to rea lize that ideal in its fullness, there must be a definite intention and conviction in my mind that I do not want to, I must not, possess anything on this earth as my property, not even this body, because this body also is a possession.
('53', 399, 1, 6, 778889) If you believe with meas you must believe with me if you are chruch goers, that is, if you believe in Godyou believe that body and soul are not one and the same thing, but that the body is a house only, a temporary residence for a soul or a spirit within; and if you believe that, as you do believe, I take itthen it follows that even the body is not yours.
('53', 399, 1, 7, 779247) It has been given to you as a temporary possession, and it can also be taken from you by Him who has given it to you.
('53', 399, 1, 8, 779365) Therefore, having that absolute conviction in me, such must be my constant desire, that this body also may be surrendered at the will of God, and while it is at my disposal, must be used not for dissipation, not for self indulgence, not for pleasure, but merely for service and service the whole of our waking hours.
('53', 399, 1, 9, 779682) And if this is true with reference to the body, how much more with reference to clothing and many other things that we use ?
('53', 399, 1, 10, 779807) Having got that conviction and held it for so many years, I am here to give you my evidence against myself, that I have not reached that perfect state of voluntary poverty.
('53', 399, 1, 11, 779980) I am a poor man, in the sense you understand of struggling to reach that ideal, not poor in the sense in which we ordinarily use the word poor.
('53', 399, 1, 12, 780124) As a matter of fact, when I was once challenged by someone, I was able to claim that to my neighbours, and people in the world I seemed to be the richest man on earth, for the richest man is really one who, possessing nothing, has everything at his disposal.
('53', 399, 1, 13, 780383) And those who have actually followed out this vow of voluntary poverty to the fullest extent possible (to reach absolute perfection is an impossibility, but the fullest possible extent for a human being) those who have reached the ideal of that state,they testify that, when you dispossess yourself of everything you have, you really possess all the treasures of the world.
('53', 399, 1, 14, 780757) In other words, you really get all that is in reality necessary for you, everything.
('53', 399, 1, 15, 780842) If food is necessary, food will come to you.
('53', 400, 0, 1, 780887) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 401
('53', 400, 1, 2, 780931) Many of you are men and women of prayer, and I have heard from very many Christian lips that they got their food in answer to prayer, that they get everything in answer to prayer.
('53', 400, 1, 3, 781111) I believe it.
('53', 400, 1, 4, 781125) But I want you to come with me a step further, and believe with me that those who voluntarily give up everything on earth, includ ing the body, that is to say, have readiness to give up every thing (and they must examine themselves critically, rigidly, and give always an adverse judgment against themselves) those who will follow this out will really find that they are never in want.
('53', 400, 1, 5, 781511) And I will confess to you that, when I felt God had given me some portion of riches of the earth and when I had many possessions, I had not the facilities for possessing things that I have at this time.
('53', 400, 1, 6, 781714) I had not certainly one millionth part of the ability to command money and everything that I need for service.
('53', 400, 1, 7, 781825) A spirit of service had come to me even when I was practising and earning money and was in possession of several things, but at that time I had certainly not the capacity for getting whatever I wanted for service.
('53', 400, 1, 8, 782039) But today (whether it is good for me or bad for me I do not know, God alone knows) I can give you this evidence, that I have never been in want.
('53', 400, 1, 9, 782184) After a period when I had really dispossessed myself by intention and had no hankering after anything that I could call my own, and began to share everything I possessed in common with my neighbours (I cannot share everything with the whole world; if I share with my neighbours, I do share with the whole world, my neighbours also doing likewise; if we do that, it is all a limited human being can do) but immediately I came to that state to a fair extent, I found that I was never in want.
('53', 400, 1, 10, 782675) Want must not, again, be taken literally.
('53', 400, 1, 11, 782717) God is the hardest task master I have known on this earth, and He tries you through and through.
('53', 400, 1, 12, 782814) And when you find that your faith is failing or your body is failing you and you are sinking, He comes to your assistance somehow or other and proves to you that you must not lose your faith and that He is always at your beck and call, but on His terms, not on your terms.
('53', 400, 1, 13, 783087) So I have found.
('53', 400, 1, 14, 783104) I cannot really recall a single instance when, at the eleventh hour, He has forsaken me.
('53', 400, 1, 15, 783193) And I have got this reputation, which I can repeat to you, a reputation for being one of the best beggars in India.
('53', 400, 1, 16, 783309) And, as my critics will tell you, at one time I collected one crore of rupees; in pounds, shillings and pence I cannot
('53', 401, 0, 1, 783428) 402 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 401, 1, 2, 783470) count it for you, but it is some horribly large sum (about  750,000), but I had no difficulty in collecting it.
('53', 401, 1, 3, 783582) And since then, whenever any emergency has arisen, not for any consideration, not in the soul of my fundamental being, can I recall a single instance of my failing to obtain whatever was necessary for service.
('53', 401, 1, 4, 783792) But you will say: this is in answer to prayer.
('53', 401, 1, 5, 783839) It is not just an answer to prayer, it is a scientific result of this vow of non possession or vow of voluntary poverty.
('53', 401, 1, 6, 783960) You do not want to possess anything whatever: and the more therefore you simplify your life, dispossess yourself, the better it is for you.
('53', 401, 1, 7, 784100) Immediately you come to that, you can command anything.
('53', 401, 1, 8, 784156) You can command vanities,but if you only once take possession of these, this power will immediately be gone; you must not take for yourself.
('53', 401, 1, 9, 784297) If you do, you are done for.
('53', 401, 1, 10, 784326) I have known this happen in so many instances.
('53', 401, 1, 11, 784373) Many a man has said:  Oh yes,God has now answered my prayer for money or possessions.
('53', 401, 1, 12, 784459) I will now keep this this Koh i noor diamond, or whatever it may be. That will be the last time.
('53', 401, 1, 13, 784556) He wont be able to defend that diamond.
('53', 401, 1, 14, 784596) Thereore, all I am just now holding out before you as a grand thing is that you can command all the resources of the world for service.
('53', 401, 1, 15, 784732) To one who does not believe, that may seem an arrogant statement to make.
('53', 401, 1, 16, 784806) But, as I believe, it is not an arrogant thing to say that you can command all the resources of the earth for serviceto the extent of your ability to serve.
('53', 401, 1, 17, 784963) If you want to command the whole services of the world, it is not enough to go down to some of those houses in the East End, find out the distress of those who live there and fling in their faces a few coppers; you will not have all the resources of the world for that; God will fling in your face also a few coppers.
('53', 401, 1, 18, 785281) But if you surrender yourself, body, soul and mind, and give yourself up to the world, then I say : the treasures of the world are at your feet, not for your enjoyment, but for the enjoyment of that service, only yours for that service.
('53', 401, 1, 19, 785518) The moral that I would have us to draw from this talk that I have given to you is really very opposite at this time.
('53', 401, 1, 20, 785635) I want you to believe me when I tell you that my whole heart goes out to this nation in its distress.
('53', 401, 1, 21, 785737) I cannot possibly present my solution of your financial difficulty.
('53', 401, 1, 22, 785805) You are great enough, resourceful enough, to find out your own remedies.
('53', 401, 1, 23, 785878) But I would ask you to elaborate this thought in your
('53', 402, 0, 1, 785932) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 403
('53', 402, 1, 2, 785976) own minds in connection with the present distress.
('53', 402, 1, 3, 786027) Mr. C. F. Andrews brought to my notice a letter that was written by the Prime Minister to a correspondent and which he told me yesterday was being used as an advertisement throughout the District Railway, probably in the Tubes also; it runs somewhat like this :  You must buy only British goods; must employ only British labour, and try to buy as much as you can. That is one remedy I know.
('53', 402, 1, 4, 786418) But I want to suggest to you that, in order to solve the problem of distress in the world, this idea of voluntary poverty is a root idea.
('53', 402, 1, 5, 786556) No doubt, with your resourcefulness, you will tide over the difficulty and feel that there was nothing wrong.
('53', 402, 1, 6, 786666) If you will permit me to say so, that would be perhaps short sighted, for a time perhaps has come for a revision of values.
('53', 402, 1, 7, 786790) But again I must not go into deep waters.
('53', 402, 1, 8, 786832) I can only throw out this hint to those who can appreciate the necessity of voluntary poverty for service.
('53', 402, 1, 9, 786939) I have not tonight presented this blessed thing for the acceptance of all : though let me add that, in the innermost recesses of my heart, I feel that the world would not go all wrong, would not become a world of idiots, if all of us took the vow of voluntary poverty.
('53', 402, 1, 10, 787208) But I know that this is almost an impossible thing.
('53', 402, 1, 11, 787260) Everything is possible for God but, humanly speaking, it is wise to say that it is an impossible thing.
('53', 402, 1, 12, 787364) But it is not an impossible thing; indeed, I hold it to be absolutely indispensable that those who give themselves wholly to the service of their fellow beings must take the vow of voluntary poverty.
('53', 402, 1, 13, 787564) Try to find out for yourself whether you are not thereby assisting very materially in solving this great national problem that today faces you.
('53', 402, 1, 14, 787708) You will not have solved the problem if the people, who do not want to give up their salaries or whatever they are required to give up, are compelled to give them up by law.
('53', 402, 1, 15, 787882) While they say: What can we do ?
('53', 402, 1, 16, 787915) We do not want to resist; we cannot resist, their minds are still hankering after these things.
('53', 402, 1, 17, 788011) But imagine that, in the midst of this hankering, there is a body of servants arising, who will themselves become voluntarily poor.
('53', 402, 1, 18, 788143) They would be like lighthouses to guide the paths of those who do not know what voluntary poverty is because they know only involuntary poverty.
('53', 402, 1, 19, 788288) I do not go among my fellows who starve and talk of voluntary poverty; I do not tell them how blessed they would be if they changed that involuntary poverty into voluntary.
('53', 402, 1, 20, 788461) There is no
('53', 403, 0, 1, 788473) 404 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 403, 1, 2, 788515) such thing as magic of that character on this earth.
('53', 403, 1, 3, 788568) It is a painful process, and these men have first of all to have the necessities of life before I can talk to them of voluntary poverty.
('53', 403, 1, 4, 788705) What does happen is this: that a man like me going among them, living in their midst as best he can their life, can bring a ray of hope into their hearts.
('53', 403, 1, 5, 788860) They will accept remedies that a man like me may suggest to them.
('53', 403, 1, 6, 788926) At least, if I cannot suggest any immediate remedy, they would find in a man like me a friend.
('53', 403, 1, 7, 789021) They would say : He is happy although he possesses nothing; how is it? I do not need to argue with them; they begin to argue for themselves.
('53', 403, 1, 8, 789162) How can I share these richest treasures from my experience with everybody on earth ?
('53', 403, 1, 9, 789247) I could not.
('53', 403, 1, 10, 789260) But today, having under taken to speak on voluntary poverty, I am sharing, to a certain extent only, these treasured experiences of mine not amongst a few hundred people here but amongst millions of people.
('53', 403, 1, 11, 789467) I tell you that it is beyond description, the bliss, the happiness, and the ability that this voluntary poverty gives one.
('53', 403, 1, 12, 789590) I can only say: try it and experiment with it, test it for yourselves.
('53', 403, 1, 13, 789661) I thank you for giving me your undivided attention.
('53', 403, 1, 14, 789713) There are still exactly ten minutes left before the hour of prayer, and if any of you wish to ask me any questions, I shall be glad.
('53', 403, 1, 15, 789846) You need not hesitate to ask anything that is in your mind; you will never offend me by asking any questions, let them be as awkward as they may be.
('53', 403, 2, 16, 789995) Q. Can the Mahatma tell us how he can justify collecting large sums of money when Jesus, the Buddha and other great religious teachers who have practised voluntary poverty have never asked for or received large sums of money ?
('53', 403, 2, 17, 790222) I cannot reconcile this with the rest of what he told us.
('53', 403, 3, 18, 790280) A. Did these great teachers never ask for or receive moneys?
('53', 403, 3, 19, 790341) After Jesus many Christians, who believed in poverty also, took moneys and used them for service.
('53', 403, 3, 20, 790439) And I can speak with better confidence about the Buddha who is reported in his own lifetime to have founded institutions.
('53', 403, 3, 21, 790561) He could not possibly found institutions without money.
('53', 403, 3, 22, 790617) And it is said that they who gave themselves body, soul and mind gave their riches also and placed them at the feet of the Buddha, who gladly accepted thembut not for himself.
('53', 403, 4, 23, 790793) Q. Why should we serve our fellow beings ?
('53', 403, 5, 24, 790836) A. In order that we may see a glimpse of God through them; because they have got the same spirit as we have, and unless we learn that, there is a barrier drawn between God and ourselves; if we want to
('53', 404, 0, 1, 791037) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 405
('53', 404, 1, 2, 791081) demolish that barrier, the beginning is made by complete identification with our fellow beings.

('53', 404, 2, 4, 791203) 442. SPEECH AT MEETING OF M.P.S 1
('53', 404, 3, 5, 791237) LONDON, September 23, 1931 The Congress stand for complete independence, and complete independence does not mean, and has never meant, isolation in any form, and does not exclude partnership on absolutely equal terms to be terminated at the will of either party.
('53', 404, 3, 6, 791500) It has appeared to me strange that this claim should be repudiated or laughed at by Englishmen, who themselves were never satisfied with anything less than complete freedom for themselves.
('53', 404, 3, 7, 791689) I think that any nation or any body of people, after they have become conscious of their national right, would never be satisfied with anything less than complete indepen dence.
('53', 404, 3, 8, 791867) It means to us full control over our defences, full control over our external affairs, and full control over finances, and the discussion on these points gave rise to the much used expression safeguards throughout.
('53', 404, 3, 9, 792082) I have no doubt that you know of the safeguards that were provisionally adjusted by the last R.T.C. I do not hesitate to say, on behalf of the Congress, that those safeguards will not be accepted by the Congress.
('53', 404, 3, 10, 792295) Now if we have no control over the army or over he defenceand external affairs are also a reserved subject according to the provisional reservations of the R.T.C.it is certainly not complete independence: it is not even a moderate form of self government.
('53', 404, 3, 11, 792551) A person does not enjoy self government if he depends on others for his defence.
('53', 404, 3, 12, 792632) I know that it has been contended that India is not able to defend herself.
('53', 404, 3, 13, 792708) Before the British advent I claim that we were able to servive invasions, and there were many invasions made, and we were able to maintain intact the civilization that we had inherited from time immemorial.

('53', 405, 1, 3, 793243) The Hindus and Muslims are living more in peace in what is called Princes India than in British India.
('53', 405, 1, 4, 793346) There have certainly been a few riots, but my claim is that British arms are not strong enough to prevent these.
('53', 405, 1, 5, 793459) If British armies were removed, it would not mean suicide for India, as is sometimes stated.
('53', 405, 1, 6, 793552) To take charge of our defence does not mean that we should do away with every British soldier and officer, if British soldiers or officers would be good enough to serve us.
('53', 405, 2, 7, 793725) Mr. Gandhi then said that he could not understand those who said that the British would never serve under India in this way.
('53', 405, 2, 8, 793850) Is this a proper attitude if there is to be any conciliation with India on terms of proper equality ?
('53', 405, 2, 9, 793952) Complete independence must mean complete control of the army.
('53', 405, 2, 10, 794014) It means that the civil power should have absolute control over the military power, that the military would not act without the sanction of the civil power.
('53', 405, 3, 11, 794171) Mr. Gandhi then pointed out that the Indians believed the administration of India to be the most expensive in the world, and India, he said, can no longer afford it.
('53', 405, 3, 12, 794337) I am convinced that it would be suicidal for India to consent to those safeguards and take the mere husk of independence.
('53', 405, 3, 13, 794459) To consent to these safeguards menas farming out our revenue to the extent of 80 per cent.
('53', 405, 3, 14, 794550) Do you suppose that we can pay for our education, hygiene, hospitals, roads and constructive works , which must be undertaken, and should have been undertaken over a generation ago, with only 20 per cent of our revenue left to us?
('53', 405, 3, 15, 794781) I would not touch that independence; I would far rather remain in compulsory subjection and declare myself a rebel than take charge of a government that I know is bound to declare itself bankrupt in, say, five or ten years.
('53', 405, 3, 16, 795005) No Englishman, if he were in our shoes, would accept that; and you will find that I would fight with my blood as a civil resister rather than co operate with you and become a slave, which in my humble opinion is what is meant by these safeguards.
('53', 405, 4, 17, 795252) As regards Safeguards for Europeans, Mr. Gandhi said: I can understand the Muslims asking for protection, and the Sikhs, and I can understand still more the untouchables; but for the Europeans, that is to say, the rulers, asking for protection from three

('53', 406, 1, 2, 795551) hundred million slaves, or subjects, call them by what sweet name you will, that surpasses my understanding.
('53', 406, 1, 3, 795660) You must live with us on terms of goodwill.
('53', 406, 1, 4, 795704) Do you want protection from the people you serve?
('53', 406, 1, 5, 795754) No protection will protect British trade in India if that trade is inimical to Indian interests.
('53', 406, 1, 6, 795851) Every interest British or Indian, will have to pass this acid test: Is it or is it not in the interests of the people?
('53', 406, 1, 7, 795970) Partnership does mean favoured treatment for the partner, but that favoured treatment would naturally carry with it the condition that the goods were goods needed in India and of the standard quality and price.
('53', 406, 1, 8, 796181) I would prefer the British typewriter and the British watch, even though I had a pay a little more, and that will be the attitude of three hundred million partners when this weight, which is gradually sinking them, is lifted from their heads.
('53', 406, 1, 9, 796424) I imagine a possible India living in perfect equality with Great Britain.
('53', 406, 1, 10, 796498) A partnership mutually beneficial, not framed for the exploitation of any race on earth, would be a partnership which the gods themselves would descend to witness, because it would be for the good of all the nations of the earth.
('53', 406, 1, 11, 796728) India would stand erect before the world, but not to exploit any other nation, because she herself has tasted the bitterness of exploitation.

('53', 406, 3, 15, 796973) I get here less time than I used to get there.
('53', 406, 3, 16, 797020) I can go to bed between 11 and 12 at night.
('53', 406, 3, 17, 797064) Mirabehn wakes up every day at four.
('53', 406, 3, 18, 797101) After prayer I again go to sleep.
('53', 406, 3, 19, 797135) Then I get up at 6.15 and go for an hours walk.
('53', 406, 3, 20, 797183) I suppose you read in the letters from others about all that happens here.
('53', 406, 3, 21, 797258) I keep very good health.
('53', 406, 3, 22, 797283) The cold has not yet begun.
('53', 406, 3, 23, 797311) I hope the atmosphere in the Ashram is becoming purer, and that everyone takes part in the prayers, in the spinning yajna and in the other activities regularly and with zest.

('53', 407, 11, 17, 798494) SIR TEJ BAHADUR SAPRU: .
('53', 407, 11, 18, 798519) Experience in other countries has proved that democratic constitutions are much more expensive than bureaucratic constitutions.
('53', 407, 11, 19, 798647) I mean, if there are any among us who think that, by adopt ing a democratic constitution, we are going to economize, let me tell them frankly that they are living in a paradise of their own.
('53', 407, 11, 20, 798838) I will not use the ordi nary expression.
('53', 407, 11, 21, 798879) Party organizations will spring up; party funds will have to be brought into existence; all the machinery and paraphernalia of Western constitutions will have to be brought

('53', 408, 1, 2, 799096) into existence before we can cope with our responsibility.
('53', 408, 1, 3, 799155) Even though the salaries of the Services might be reduced to Rs. 500, even though a maximum amount of income might be prescribed for lawyers like Mr. Jinnah, still Mahatma Gandhi will have to face this problem, that he will have to find the funds to meet the requirements of the democratic constitution.
('53', 408, 2, 4, 799459) MR. GANDHI : No, I shall presently seek shelter in Bikaner or Porbandar!

('53', 408, 6, 9, 799779) LONDON, [On or before September 25, 1931] I was a very ordinary body and had no inkling as to my future destiny.
('53', 408, 6, 10, 799892) I used to run about the streets barefoot and play with the other lads.
('53', 408, 6, 11, 799963) I went to an Indian school, for, of course, I was born in India; not Africa, as people think.
('53', 408, 6, 12, 800057) I had a happy childhood, and was not precocious in any way.
('53', 408, 6, 13, 800117) My father was Prime Minister of the State in which I was born.
('53', 408, 6, 14, 800180) The call to lead India did not come to me in the nature of a sudden revelation.
('53', 408, 6, 15, 800260) It simply came when it came.
('53', 408, 6, 16, 800289) It was rather a gradual realization.
('53', 408, 6, 17, 800326) I prepared for it by fasting and self discipline.
('53', 408, 6, 18, 800376) My political work grew out of my spiritual preparation.
('53', 408, 6, 19, 800432) You ask me to compare the poverty in the East with that of the West?
('53', 408, 6, 20, 800501) It is impossible.
('53', 408, 6, 21, 800519) The two cannot be compared.
('53', 408, 6, 22, 800547) In the East, poverty exists to a degree undreamt of in the West.
('53', 408, 6, 23, 800612) Many thousands are entirely without food, and quite without shelter.
('53', 408, 6, 24, 800681) You ask me how I would fulfil my dreams if I had the power, what I would do to wake the dumb, starving millions from their lethargy, make them articulate, and give them food.
('53', 408, 6, 25, 800856) I would make them work.
('53', 408, 6, 26, 800880) At what?
('53', 408, 6, 27, 800889) At the charkha and handlooms.
('53', 408, 6, 28, 800919) I would educate them.
('53', 408, 6, 29, 800941) Yes, on Indian lines.
('53', 408, 6, 30, 800963) I would build new roadsfine roads, that would benefit both man and beast.
('53', 408, 6, 31, 801037) I picture the new India as filled with linked villages, happy in their industries.
('53', 409, 0, 1, 801120) 410 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 409, 1, 2, 801162) If India gets her freedom, I should be guided by circumstances as to whether I should take my place at the head of the nation or return quietly to my Ashram.
('53', 409, 1, 3, 801320) I should love to go back, but I should not hesitate to shoulder the burden of leadership if it came to me.
('53', 409, 1, 4, 801427) I should follow the guidance of my inner voice.
('53', 409, 1, 5, 801475) Shall I go to America?
('53', 409, 1, 6, 801498) Invitations have reached me, but there again I shall do as my inner voice tells me.
('53', 409, 1, 7, 801582) You ask: Is this an actual definite voice?
('53', 409, 1, 8, 801625) it is the voice of conscience.
('53', 409, 1, 9, 801656) I am prepared to compromise on non essential matters, but not on essentials.
('53', 409, 1, 10, 801733) Yes, certainly, I think the co operation of the Indian Princes is necessary for a successful swaraj.
('53', 409, 1, 11, 801834) Enemies of India say that the Hindus and Muslims will fly at each others throats as soon as the British rule is withdrawn.
('53', 409, 1, 12, 801957) I do not believe it.
('53', 409, 1, 13, 801978) We have lived together in perfect unity before before the British advent in the seventeenth century and we shall do so again.
('53', 409, 1, 14, 802104) But, supposing that we have to fight, we shall fight.
('53', 409, 1, 15, 802158) Will the Hindus conquer, you ask.
('53', 409, 1, 16, 802192) No; neither side will conquer.
('53', 409, 1, 17, 802223) There might be conflict in India, but we shall come to terms and reach an agreement.
('53', 409, 1, 18, 802308) We have fought before now and come together again.
('53', 409, 1, 19, 802359) The heads of the two parties, the Hindus and the Muslims, would come to terms.
('53', 409, 1, 20, 802438) Who would fight?
('53', 409, 1, 21, 802455) Not the masses.
('53', 409, 1, 22, 802471) They would continue to live as they do now, in perfect peace.
('53', 409, 1, 23, 802533) Those who fought would be only the interested people.
('53', 409, 1, 24, 802587) I think Britain is bound to concede swaraj.
('53', 409, 1, 25, 802631) Sooner or later it is sure to come.
('53', 409, 1, 26, 802667) My wife has been extraordinarily good to me, and it is she who cares for my physical welfare.
('53', 409, 1, 27, 802761) How did I marry her?
('53', 409, 1, 28, 802782) My parents arranged the marriage, as parents do most marriages in India, but I knew her before and love existed between us.
('53', 409, 1, 29, 802906) I started life as a legal adviser to a Mussalman firm in South Africa, and when I saw that the Indians there were being persecuted, I thought, it was my duty to take up their cause.
('53', 409, 1, 30, 803088) I, thereore, settled in South Africa, and I was successful.
('53', 409, 1, 31, 803148) The disabilities for which we were fighting were removed by a settlement of the South African government.
('53', 409, 1, 32, 803254) What would be the position of the women in India under swaraj?

('53', 410, 1, 2, 803361) They would be our co workers and colleagues, enjoy the same rights and privileges as the men.
('53', 410, 1, 3, 803455) No, I was not surprised to find I had so many sympathizers here.
('53', 410, 1, 4, 803520) I fully expected it.
('53', 410, 1, 5, 803541) I am hoping that the people of Great Britain will see the utter justice of Indias claim.

('53', 410, 7, 14, 804136) SPRINGVALE GARDEN VILLAGE, September 26, 1931 I have come to England, and now to Lancashire, in search of a way out of the difficulty.
('53', 410, 7, 15, 804271) Unemployment in any country is always bad, and it would be a matter of the greatest joy to me if I could, in any shape or form, contribute towards relieving that unemployment.
('53', 410, 7, 16, 804447) But I am powerless to do anything without the active co operation of Lancashire and of Englishmen in other parts of Great Britain.
('53', 410, 8, 17, 804578) 1 Gandhiji made the statement after his meeting with Lord Irwin.
('53', 410, 8, 18, 804643) The meeting took place at the latters house in Eaton Square and lasted two hours and twenty minutes.
('53', 410, 8, 19, 804744) No report of the talk is available 2 Gandhiji made this statement on boarding the train to Lancashire at Euston in the evening.
('53', 411, 0, 1, 804872) 412 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 411, 1, 2, 804914) The poverty I have seen distresses me, and it distresses me further to know that in this unemployment I have a kind of a share.
('53', 411, 1, 3, 805042) That distress is relieved, however, by the knowledge that my part was wholly unin tended; that it was as a result of the steps I took, and had to take, as part of my duty towards the largest army of unemployed to be found in the world, namely the starving millions of India, compared with whose poverty and pauperism the poverty of Lancashire dwindles into insignificance.
('53', 411, 1, 4, 805415) I am therefore trying to meet as many Englishmen as possible, and acquaint myself with their mentality and am trying to give them, as I know it, the correct situation in India.

('53', 411, 3, 7, 805675) EDGEWORTH, September 26, 1931
('53', 411, 4, 8, 805705) In his speech Mr. Gandhi outlined at considerable length his economic policy for India, and explained how the khaddar movement also had a social significance, since it was aimed at producing self respect in the Indian villager.
('53', 411, 4, 9, 805933) He drew waht was generally agreed to be a heart rending picture of Indian poverty, and said that though the conditions in Lancashire as he had seen them distressed him, they were infinitely better than those obtaining in India.
('53', 411, 5, 10, 806161) Q. Is it possible, Mr. Gandhi, to divorce boycott for a political purpose from boycott for an economic purpose?
('53', 411, 5, 11, 806273) A. When the sole object was that of punishing Britain as in 1930, when people preferred articles of American or German make to those of British make, it was avowedly of a political purpose.
('53', 411, 5, 12, 806463) Even British machinery was then boycotted.

('53', 411, 6, 14, 806536) 1 The meeting was arranged by T. D. Barlow, Chairman of the Joint Committee of Cotton Trade Organizations, at his residence in the afternoon and included several prominent representatives of the cotton trade.

('53', 411, 6, 16, 806900) Some of those present, however, sent to The Manchester Guardian their own accounts of what Gandhiji said (vide Appendix Account of Meeting with Representatives of cotton Trade).

('53', 412, 1, 2, 807315) boycott remains.
('53', 412, 1, 3, 807332) You may call it boycott but it is an entirely educative effort or self purificatory endeavour.
('53', 412, 1, 4, 807427) It is an appeal to go back to our former calling, shake off idleness and earn a living, however poor, not on doles but in the sweat of their brow.
('53', 412, 2, 5, 807574) Q. But the political aspect would be there inasmuch as you would give preference to your mills over all other foreign articles.
('53', 412, 3, 6, 807702) A. The boycott was not undertaken on behalf of the mills.
('53', 412, 3, 7, 807760) In fact, it was the first constructive effort begun with our quarrel with the local mill owners, and though the mill owners are supporting our movement, they are not controlling our policy but we are trying to influence them.
('53', 412, 3, 8, 807986) And when we go out to the villages, we do not ask them to wear Indian mill cloth, we ask them to wear khadi or to make their own khadi, and every Congressman is expected to wear khadi.
('53', 412, 4, 9, 808171) Q. Whatever you may say, Mr. Gandhi, you are in for more political power, which you are bound to get, and as soon as you get it, these mill owners, in the unscrupulousness of their greed, will build huge tariff walls and be a graver danger to your villages than even the Lancashire cotton trade.
('53', 412, 5, 10, 808467) A. If I am still living then, and if such a catastrophe happens, I make bold to say that the mills will be destroyed in the process.
('53', 412, 5, 11, 808600) And, with real politcial power, universal adult suffrage will come and it will be impossible for the monied classes to crush the interests of poor villagers.
('53', 412, 6, 12, 808758) Q. Dont you think people themselves will go back to mill cloth as the Americans are going back to liquor ?

('53', 412, 7, 17, 809139) And, whatever happens I shall fight on for the economic salvation of my people and that, you will agree, is worth living for and dying for.
('53', 412, 8, 18, 809279) Q. It will be an unequal fight.

('53', 413, 2, 11, 810361) You will find me an easy proposition, but if you will repel my advances I shall go away, not in bitterness, but with a sense that I was not pure enough to find a lodgment in your hearts.

('53', 413, 4, 14, 810622) SPRINGFIELD GARDEN VILLAGE, September 26, 1931 There is no boycott of British cloth, as distinguished from other foreign cloth, since the 5th March when the Truce was signed.
('53', 413, 4, 15, 810797) As a nation we are pledged to boycott all foreign cloth, but in case of an honourable settlement between England and India, i.e., in case of a permanent peace, I should not hesitate to give preference to Lancashire cloth to all other foreign cloth, to the extent that we may need to supplement out cloth and on agreed terms.

('53', 414, 3, 8, 811892) I am pained at the unemployment here.
('53', 414, 3, 9, 811930) But here is no starvation or semi starvation.
('53', 414, 3, 10, 811976) In India we have both.
('53', 414, 3, 11, 811999) If you went to the villages of India, you would find utter despair in the eyes of the villages, you would find half starved skeletons, living corpses.
('53', 414, 3, 12, 812150) If India could revive them by putting life and food into them in the shape of work India would help the world.
('53', 414, 3, 13, 812261) Today India is a curse.
('53', 414, 3, 14, 812285) There is a party in my country which would sooner see an end to the lives of these half starved millions in order that the rest may live.
('53', 414, 3, 15, 812423) I thought of a humane method and that was to give them work with which they were familiar, which they could do in their cottages, which required no great investment in implements and of which the product could be easily sold.
('53', 414, 3, 16, 812649) This is a task which is worthy of the attention even of Lancashire.

('53', 414, 7, 22, 812945) Shri Kishorelal has invited the opinion of scholars.

('53', 415, 2, 5, 813694) 456. PARSIS PROTEST About one hundred and seventy five Parsis were signatories to the note of protest expressing profound disapproval of the indignities prepetrated upon Shri Abidali and other Congress picketers on the 10th of August last.
('53', 415, 2, 6, 813934) Among the signatories are barristers, doctors, solicitors and professors also.
('53', 415, 2, 7, 814013) I compliment the signatories on making this protest.
('53', 415, 2, 8, 814066) But at the same time, I should make it clear that this protest will have hardly any effect upon those who had a hand in staging these disturbances.
('53', 415, 2, 9, 814214) The real need is to come into personal contact with those liquor dealers, to formulate a scheme to find some other respectable profession for them and to develop a strong public opinion among the Parsis against this present trade of theirs.
('53', 415, 2, 10, 814455) The argument put forward by these liquor dealers is that, they give up their trade, someone else will take it up.
('53', 415, 2, 11, 814569) What I have suggested to them is that, as a result of their giving up their trade, public opinion will be generated even outside the Parsi community, that it will become impossible even for others to take to that immoral trade.
('53', 415, 2, 12, 814797) In Navajivan, 1 I have already cited the example of the Bhandaris of Ratnagiri district.
('53', 415, 2, 13, 814886) By giving up their hereditary profession of selling liquor, they set out on the war path.
('53', 415, 2, 14, 814976) Many Kolis have done likewise.
('53', 415, 2, 15, 815007) Hence, if the Parsis also adopt this reform , even though they may not be regarded as pioneers they would have emulated a worthy example and they would also have contributed their share to the national welfare work of uprooting a trade which is doing such irreparable harm to labourers.

('53', 416, 7, 12, 816194) WEST BRADFORD, September 27, 1931
('53', 416, 8, 13, 816228) Mr. Gandhi began by accepting the Lancashire view that a part of the countrys unemployment was caused by action taken by him in India.
('53', 416, 8, 14, 816363) He admitted that a great many of the politically minded in India took up the boycott in a spirit of revenge, and found pleasure in hitting England by it.
('53', 416, 8, 15, 816517) It was not a matter of pleasure to him, and his arrest took the campaign in a rather different direction from what it might have done.
('53', 416, 8, 16, 816652) Had the Government understood the strength behind his letter to Lord Irwin 2 laying down the famous eleven points, history might have been written differently.
('53', 416, 8, 17, 816812) When he was arrested, the boycott became a universal cry.
('53', 416, 8, 18, 816870) His own plan, Mr. Gandhi explained, would have been a boycott of foreign cloth, but the people took the law into their own hands, made the boycott one of British goods, and continued to buy Japanese cloth, American typewriters, and so on.
('53', 416, 9, 19, 817109) 1 The meeting was held in the morning at Heys Farm Guest House where the school was conducted and where Gandhiji stayed the night.

('53', 417, 2, 3, 817472) <image: None, width: 3, height: 12, bpc: 1>
('53', 417, 3, 4, 817516) the boycott of British goods stopped, but that of foreign goods remained at his instance.
('53', 417, 3, 5, 817606) Mr. Gandhi spoke of his negotiations with Lord Irwin on the boycotts of liquor and intoxicating drugs and foreign cloth, of Lord Irwins anxiety to get the boycott on British cloth lifted, of the arguments used against this, and of Lord Irwins final agreement that he would not endanger a settlement by insisting on the removal of the boycotts, which still remain.
('53', 417, 3, 6, 817970) As in his other statements, Mr. Gandhi compared the 3,000,000 British unemployed with Indias 300,000,000. He spoke of doles as taking away self respect, and described how, in conducting strikes in India, he had set his face against doles, and encouraged the strikers to find other employment at much less wages rather than be idle.
('53', 417, 3, 7, 818302) He spoke of some strikers who had been taught to weave and make themselves independent.
('53', 417, 4, 8, 818390) Mr. Gandhi then went on to state his view that Indian poverty is the result of British policy through the overthrowing of Indias old cotton industry by the machines of Lancashire more than a hundred years ago.
('53', 417, 4, 9, 818600) He argued that the descendants of those who destryoed the supplementary means of livelihood (which supplied the butter to the bread which the peasant earned from the soil) could not now complain if the descendants of the dispossessed tried to rehabilitate themselves.
('53', 417, 5, 10, 818868) He declared that it was an impossibility to seek to revive the Lancashire trade on its original foundations, and he could not lend a hand to the process.
('53', 417, 5, 11, 819022) Equally he would not lift a finger to sustain the Indian mills.
('53', 417, 5, 12, 819086) He might some time have to seek their destruction, but at present they did not interfere with the employment of the villagers, and he was tolerating them.
('53', 417, 5, 13, 819241) He did not say to the villagers that they must buy indigenous mill cloth; what he said to them was that they must not buy foreign cloth and that they must make their own cloth.
('53', 417, 6, 14, 819418) Mr. Gandhi described the conditions of the villagers, saying that 7s.
('53', 417, 6, 15, 819488) was their average monthly income; the addition of 3s.
('53', 417, 6, 16, 819542) would add a fortune, and those who had taken up the spinning wheel were free from debt.
('53', 417, 6, 17, 819630) He drew an idyllic picture of little children spinning while they were playing, and contrasted the life of the villagers who lived on a little bit of rice flung by insolent wealth with their position when the glorious work was done in their own homes.
('53', 417, 6, 18, 819882) The only solace he could bring to Lancashire was that these teeming millions had no ill will to Lancashire, and did not know what Lancashire was.
('53', 417, 6, 19, 820028) They had no clothing, but a little bit of rag.
('53', 417, 7, 20, 820075) This led Mr. Gandhi to explain his own choice of costume: he wished to appear as faithfully as could be as the representative of the teeming and naked millions.
('53', 417, 7, 21, 820236) Even, he said, if he had to appear before the King hewould be discourteous if he did

('53', 418, 1, 2, 820523) not appear in his loin cloth.
('53', 418, 1, 3, 820553) He would consider himself indecent if he took a yard of cloth beyond the physical requirements of the teeming millions, whom he described as having but one meal, not knowing milk, and as sometimes being driven in the summer months to live on grass.
('53', 418, 1, 4, 820802) These millions were knocking at our doors, and, in closing, Mr. Gandhi urged that England must not build her happiness on the tombs of millions, as she had done, he feared.
('53', 418, 2, 5, 820975) In the discussion Mr. Gandhi repeated his argument that the boycott may have been the last straw, but was only a contributory factor in Lancashires loss of trade.
('53', 418, 2, 6, 821138) He noted the other world causes of Lancashires decline.
('53', 418, 2, 7, 821194) He also repeated his suggestion that, assuming that there is a fair settlement with Great Britain, it is possible to have a contract with Lancashire on behalf of the Government for taking, on a decreasing scale from year to year, goods from Lancashire.
('53', 418, 2, 8, 821447) This, he admitted, would simply tide over Lancashires difficulty for a little time and no more.
('53', 418, 3, 9, 821543) Mr. Gandhi contested a suggestion that his policy is a dangerous form of nationalism.
('53', 418, 3, 10, 821629) He gave the impression of desiring an India self sufficing in food and clothing, but open to receive other kinds of goods from abroad.
('53', 418, 3, 11, 821764) He left his hearers with some final words about Japanese business methods, and urged that it would be better for Lancashire to divert her attention from India and solve her problems in terms of the world crisis, in which the Indian contribution was only a speck on the screen.

('53', 418, 5, 14, 822137) WEST BRADFORD, September 27, 1931 I would be untrue to you, I would be a false friend if I were not frank with you.
('53', 418, 5, 15, 822253) I strove with Lord Irwin last March for the liberty to boycott liquor and foreign cloth.
('53', 418, 5, 16, 822342) He suggested that I might give up the boycott for three months as a gesture and then resume it.
('53', 418, 5, 17, 822438) I said I could not give it up for three minutes.
('53', 418, 5, 18, 822487) You have three million unemployed, but we have nearly three hundred million unemployed for half the year.
('53', 418, 5, 19, 822593) Your average unemployment dole is 70 shillings.
('53', 418, 5, 20, 822641) Our average income is 7 shillings and six pence a month.
('53', 418, 5, 21, 822698) That operative was right in saying that he was falling in his own estimation.
('53', 418, 5, 22, 822776) I do believe it is a debasing thing for a human being to remain idle and to live on doles.
('53', 418, 5, 23, 822867) Whilst conducting a strike, I would not brook the

('53', 419, 1, 2, 823022) strikers remaining idle for a single day and got them to break the stones or carry sand and work in public streets asking my own co workers to join them in that work.
('53', 419, 1, 3, 823189) Imagine, therefore, what a calamity it must be to have 300 million unemployed, several millions becoming degraded every day for want of employment, devoid of self respect, devoid of faith in God .
('53', 419, 1, 4, 823386) I dare not take before them the message of God.
('53', 419, 1, 5, 823434) I may as well place before the dog over there the message of God as before those hungry millions who have no lustre in their eyes and whose only God is their bread.
('53', 419, 1, 6, 823599) I can take before them a message of God only by taking the message of sacred work before them.
('53', 419, 1, 7, 823694) It is good enough to talk of God whilst we are sitting here after a nice breakfast and looking forward to a nicer luncheon, but how am I to talk of God to the millions who have to go without two meals a day?
('53', 419, 1, 8, 823902) To them God can only appear as bread and butter.
('53', 419, 1, 9, 823951) Well, the peasants of India were getting their bread from their soil.
('53', 419, 1, 10, 824021) I offered them the spinning wheel in order that they may get butter, and if I appear today before the British public in my loin cloth, it is because I have come as the sole representative of those half starved, half naked dumb millions.
('53', 419, 1, 11, 824258) We have prayed that we may bask in the presence of Gods sunshine.
('53', 419, 1, 12, 824324) I tell you it is impossible to do so whilst millions are knocking at your door.
('53', 419, 1, 13, 824404) Even in your misery you are comparatively happy.
('53', 419, 1, 14, 824453) I do not grudge you that happiness.
('53', 419, 1, 15, 824489) I wish well to you, but do not think of prospering on the tombs of the poor millions of India.
('53', 419, 1, 16, 824584) I do not want for India an isolated life at all, but I do not want to depend on any country for my food and clothing.
('53', 419, 1, 17, 824702) Whilst we may devise means for tiding over the present crisis, I must tell you that you should cherish no hope of reviving the old Lancashire trade.
('53', 419, 1, 18, 824851) It is impossible.
('53', 419, 1, 19, 824869) I cannot religiously help in the process.
('53', 419, 1, 20, 824911) 1 Supposing, I have suddenly stopped breathing and I am helped by artificial respiration for a while and begin to breathe again, must I, for ever, depend on artificial respiration and refuse to use my own lungs again ?
('53', 419, 1, 21, 825130) No, it would be suicidal.
('53', 419, 1, 22, 825156) I must try to strengthen my own lungs and live on my own resources.
('53', 419, 1, 23, 825224) You must pray to God that India may strengthen her lungs.
('53', 419, 1, 24, 825282) Do not attribute your misery to India.

('53', 420, 1, 2, 825522) 460. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS 1
('53', 420, 2, 3, 825552) WEST BRADFORD, September 27, 1931 I have certainly been very happy here and have experienced nothing but the greatest affection and kindness.
('53', 420, 2, 4, 825694) I have seen various groups of operatives and employers, with whom I have had very friendly discussion.
('53', 420, 2, 5, 825797) I feel that I have learned something of the distress in Lancashire, and my heart has gone out to the suffering operatives.
('53', 420, 2, 6, 825920) I saw Mr. Daviess mill and the whole shed in which the looms are lying idle.
('53', 420, 2, 7, 825997) I have explained to him my personal and that of the Congress.
('53', 420, 2, 8, 826059) I have shown to him the limited extent to which help from India is possible in the event of a permanent settlement coming through.
('53', 420, 2, 9, 826190) But I am also oppressed with the fact that unemployment is so widespread that the help that can possibly come from India will affect but a small class.
('53', 420, 2, 10, 826342) It has appeared to me that the cause of distress in Lancashire is more largely due to world causes than to the Indian boycott.
('53', 420, 2, 11, 826469) Even before the Indian boycott came in its intense form last year, Lancashires trade with India was not much over 15 per cent of the total production.
('53', 420, 2, 12, 826620) I do not think it has been adversely affected by the boycott to more than 3 per cent, or it may be a little over.
('53', 420, 2, 13, 826734) The question, therefore, so far as India is concerned, is limited to a very small compass.
('53', 420, 2, 14, 826825) It would be presumptuous for me to say what can be otherwise done in order to alleviate or entirely remove the present distress in Lancashire.
('53', 420, 2, 15, 826968) And so far as India is concerned, I have already given you an idea of what is at the most possible.
('53', 420, 2, 16, 827068) But whether something ultimately does or does not result, the two days of intimate contact with the employers and employed has shown me that the people of Lancashire have borne their distress very bravely, and it has been a matter of the keenest satisfaction to me that they have not shown any bitterness towards India, which I regard as a happy sign.
('53', 420, 2, 17, 827420) I had never expected anything but courteous treatment from the working people of Lancashire, but I was quite unprepared for the manifestation of deep affection that the crowds of people lining the
('53', 420, 3, 18, 827617) 1 According to the source, Gandhiji received the party of Press reporters at noon.
('53', 421, 0, 1, 827700) 422 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 421, 1, 2, 827742) streets yesterday spontaneously showed to me.
('53', 421, 1, 3, 827788) I shall ever treasure that affection as one of the pleasant recollections of my life.
('53', 421, 1, 4, 827874) That is all.
('53', 421, 2, 5, 827887) Asked if he was in a position to confirm a statement attributed to him that if India secured self government, he would be agreeable to the prohibition of foreign imported cloths, with the exception of Lancashire goods, Mr. Gandhi said : I would agree to the prohibition of all foreign cloths but Lancashire cloths, to the extent that foreign cloth was still necessary to supplement the Indian supply.
('53', 421, 2, 6, 828288) Necessarily, there would have to be conditions about the standard of quality and of price, which, however, could be mutually arranged.
('53', 421, 3, 7, 828423) Asked if Indias policy of manufacturing her own cotton goods would not affect her own exports of raw products, Mr.Gandhi said India would be buying from the other nations of the earth, or from England, under a favoured nation clause, many things besides cotton piece goods.
('53', 421, 3, 8, 828697) He said : India is not, and will not be for a long time to come, entirely self contained for all her wants.
('53', 421, 3, 9, 828805) For instance, India is at present importing large quantities of hardware, sugar, etc.
('53', 421, 4, 10, 828891) Q. Do you agree that a decline in imported goods would result in a corresponding decrease in the demand for Indian raw cotton?
('53', 421, 5, 11, 829018) A. Cotton is not such a special crop that once grown it must always be grown.
('53', 421, 5, 12, 829096) The cultivator would immediately respond to changed conditions and grow other crops which are favourable.
('53', 421, 6, 13, 829202) Asked if he would specifically exclude Japanese cotton goods, Mr. Gandhi said : I would put a prohibitive tariff upon Japanese piece goods, also other piece goods, and any other foreign goods.
('53', 421, 6, 14, 829395) It would not be a question of discriminating against Japan.
('53', 421, 6, 15, 829455) I have no complaint to make against her.
('53', 421, 6, 16, 829496) I would simply take my goods from my partner.
('53', 421, 6, 17, 829542) Japan or any other nation could not complain if I did not take their goods because I was manufacturing those goods myself, nor need they complain if I take them from my partner.
('53', 421, 7, 18, 829720) Q. All that depends on self government?
('53', 421, 8, 19, 829760) A. Yes, it must be absolutely a free will and voluntary thing.
('53', 421, 8, 20, 829823) I would not be conferring a benefit on Lancashire at the expense of India.
('53', 421, 8, 21, 829898) If I do need more foreign cloth, it would be foolish on my part not to take it from England, if England is my partner.
('53', 421, 9, 22, 830017) Q. Supposing these negotiations break down?
('53', 422, 0, 1, 830061) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 423
('53', 422, 1, 2, 830105) A. Then heaven help India!
('53', 422, 1, 3, 830132) India must then go through the fire of suffering.
('53', 422, 1, 4, 830182) There is no question of India finding her peace unless India finds also her freedom.
('53', 422, 1, 5, 830267) That is a settled fact.
('53', 422, 2, 6, 830291) Asked if he was hopeful, Mr. Gandhi said : It is in the hands of God .
('53', 422, 2, 7, 830362) It is very difficult to say.
('53', 422, 3, 8, 830391) Q. Do you feel the prospects of a settlement are endangered by the political situation in England at the moment ?
('53', 422, 3, 9, 830505) A. The prospects will be, or may be, endangered if British statesmen come to the conclusion that the settlement with India is not necessary in order to solve the present porblem.
('53', 422, 3, 10, 830684) If they feel it can be shuntedthen there is danger.
('53', 422, 3, 11, 830736) But if they feel that India is a factor in dealing with the domestic problemthen, of course, the Indian question retains the same importance, if it does not gain greater importance because of this domestic problem.
('53', 422, 4, 12, 830951) In response to an inquiry whether, if there is a General Election, he will wait until it finishes, Mr. Gandhi said : I do not want to wait indefinitely here.
('53', 422, 4, 13, 831109) It would be inconvenient for me to wait here marking time.
('53', 422, 4, 14, 831168) If dissolution comes next week, my attitude would be determined by the attitude of the British Ministers as to what they want to do.
('53', 422, 4, 15, 831301) If they want to mark time, to postpone the proceedings of the Conference, or to postpone effective decisions, I certainly would want to go away.
('53', 422, 4, 16, 831446) Whether I returned for a resumption of the Conference depends on the situation that faces me at that time.
('53', 422, 4, 17, 831553) I have certainly not calculated upon any postponement of the Conference, but I had calculated upon a final conclusion being reached.
('53', 422, 5, 18, 831686) Q. Do you think there has been progress or retrogression?
('53', 422, 5, 19, 831744) A. I dont think there has been any progress or retrogression.
('53', 422, 6, 20, 831806) Q. Do you look for progress?
('53', 422, 6, 21, 831835) A. That is a ticklish problem.
('53', 422, 7, 22, 831866) Q. Has Congress reached any conclusion?
('53', 422, 7, 23, 831906) A. Not any positive conclusion.
('53', 422, 7, 24, 831938) It is difficult.
('53', 422, 8, 25, 831955) Q. Have you acquainted British Ministers with your plans in the event of a General Election being held?
('53', 422, 8, 26, 832059) A. I have no plans.
('53', 422, 8, 27, 832079) I do not know what my plans will be.
('53', 422, 9, 28, 832116) In reply to a question respecting currency, Mr. Gandhi said he did not regard himself as an expert.

('53', 423, 2, 3, 832335) WEST BRADFORD, September 27, 1931
('53', 423, 3, 4, 832369) Mr. Gandhi said he had no ill will either against Lancashire or England, and though he might claim to be author of the boycott, the movement was not started in any spirit of bitterness whatever.
('53', 423, 3, 5, 832564) He declared that the boycott was largely a policy of economy.
('53', 423, 3, 6, 832626) His idea was not so much to boycott foreign cloth as to persuade the Indians to stop using machine made cloth of any description.
('53', 423, 3, 7, 832756) While recognizing that that was practically impossible of achievement, he wished to wean them as far as possible from buying machine made cloth.
('53', 423, 3, 8, 832901) Mr. Gandhi pointed out that, owing to the situation in India, for six months in the year the peasant was absolutely without work, for it was not possible to work on the land.
('53', 423, 3, 9, 833076) Therefore, during that six months the peasant was on the verge of starvation.
('53', 423, 3, 10, 833154) His idea was to occupy the interim period with weaving whereby the peasants could earn a little money.
('53', 423, 3, 11, 833257) Thousands of Indians were therefore reverting to the spinning wheel, and within the last year or so there were more than 100,000 peasants spinining or weaving cloth
('53', 423, 4, 12, 833422) The Mahatama declared that politics had no charms for him.
('53', 423, 4, 13, 833481) The only thing he had at heart was the moral welfare of his own class.
('53', 423, 4, 14, 833552) From his own observations since coming to the country, he had realized that Lancashire was certainly suffering from the great trade depression.
('53', 423, 4, 15, 833696) He wanted the people of Lancashire to understand that there were such things as comparisons in poverty, and that we were a long way above the poverty line prevalent in India.
('53', 423, 4, 16, 833871) He started that the income of all the people of India, including the millionaires, averaged at 7s 6d per month per Indian.
('53', 423, 4, 17, 833994) From that it would be recognized how poor the poorest of the poor must be.
('53', 423, 5, 18, 834069) Mr. Brame asked if nothing could be done to alleviate both the suffering in Lancashire and in India.
('53', 423, 6, 19, 834170) Mr. Gandhi said if he could obtain satisfaction at the Round Table Conference, he would promise to do all he could to stop the import of cloth from Japan and Italy into India, and would allow Lancashire to have the first opportunity of providing the Indians with the deficiency between what they supplied themselves and the demand.
('53', 423, 6, 20, 834502) He did not wish them to overlook the fact that Lancashires trade with India must ever be a depreciating one.
('53', 423, 6, 21, 834611) The Clitheroe Advertiser and Times, 2 10 1931
('53', 423, 7, 22, 834657) 1 Gandhiji received the deputation from the Clitheroe Weavers Association in the afternoon.
('53', 423, 7, 23, 834749) The deputation was led by H.L. Parkinson, the President, and G. Brame, the Secretary and included our unemployed weavers.

('53', 424, 1, 2, 834915) 462. MYSELF, MY SPINNING WHEEL AND WOMEN 1
('53', 424, 2, 3, 834958) What am I here for?
('53', 424, 2, 4, 834978) What do I believe in?
('53', 424, 2, 5, 835000) What is the India I would build?
('53', 424, 2, 6, 835033) Well, before all else, I am here to uphold the truth as I see it, for I believe it is the keystone of life.
('53', 424, 2, 7, 835141) On it everything else depends.
('53', 424, 2, 8, 835172) It comes first and last and always.
('53', 424, 2, 9, 835208) And in all things it is possible to put Truth first.
('53', 424, 2, 10, 835261) For myself I have always tried to do it.
('53', 424, 2, 11, 835302) In my political ambitions I eschew all lies and fraud.
('53', 424, 2, 12, 835357) For the attainment of no object would I subscribe to deceit.
('53', 424, 2, 13, 835418) I have read many varying descriptions of myself.
('53', 424, 2, 14, 835467) Some call me a saint.
('53', 424, 2, 15, 835489) Others call me a rouge.
('53', 424, 2, 16, 835513) I am neither the one nor the other.
('53', 424, 2, 17, 835549) All that I aspire to be and I hope I have in some measure succeeded in beingis an honest, godfearing man.
('53', 424, 2, 18, 835655) But the things I read about myself do not annoy me.
('53', 424, 2, 19, 835707) Why should they?
('53', 424, 2, 20, 835724) I have my own philosophy and my work.
('53', 424, 2, 21, 835762) Everyday I spin for a time.
('53', 424, 2, 22, 835790) While I spin I think.
('53', 424, 2, 23, 835812) I think of many things.
('53', 424, 2, 24, 835836) But always from those thoughts I try to keep out bitterness.
('53', 424, 2, 25, 835897) Study this spinning wheel of mine.
('53', 424, 2, 26, 835932) It would teach you a great deal more than I canpatience, industry, simplicity.
('53', 424, 2, 27, 836011) This spinning wheel is for Indias starving millions the symbol of salvation.
('53', 424, 3, 28, 836088) MY LOIN CLOTH My dress, which is described in the newspapers as a loin cloth, is criticized, made fun of.
('53', 424, 3, 29, 836194) I am asked why I wear it.
('53', 424, 3, 30, 836220) Some seem to resent my wearing it.
('53', 424, 3, 31, 836255) When Englishmen visit India, do they forsake their European clothing and adopt our Eastern dress, which is much more suitable to the climate?
('53', 424, 3, 32, 836397) And there is the answer to those who ask why in England I wear the dress to which I am accustomed, the dress of India.
('53', 424, 3, 33, 836516) If I came here to live and work as an English citizen, then I should conform to the customs of the country and should wear the dress of an Englishman.
('53', 424, 3, 34, 836667) But I am here on a great and special mission, and my loin cloth, if you choose so to describe it, is the dress of my principals, the people of India.
('53', 424, 3, 35, 836817) Into my keeping a sacred trust has

('53', 425, 0, 1, 836942) 426 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 425, 1, 2, 836984) been put.
('53', 425, 1, 3, 836994) A special duty has been given me to perform.
('53', 425, 1, 4, 837039) I must, therefore, wear the symbol of my mission.
('53', 425, 1, 5, 837089) I find these different descriptions of me interesting sometimes amusing but I am just a representative of my people, endeavouring to fulfil the task they have entrusted to me.
('53', 425, 1, 6, 837265) Yes, I believe in complete equality for women and, in the India I seek to build, they would have it.
('53', 425, 1, 7, 837366) The reason I have so many women co workers is, I believe, due to my adoption of celibacy and my instinctive sympathy for women.
('53', 425, 1, 8, 837494) You have probably heard that in my country women occupy a subordinante position.
('53', 425, 1, 9, 837575) This is only so outwardly.
('53', 425, 1, 10, 837602) Actually, their influence has ever been of the strongest.
('53', 425, 1, 11, 837660) For centuries women have worked on an equal footing with men .
('53', 425, 1, 12, 837723) If they ceased work, then many of the men would starve.
('53', 425, 1, 13, 837779) PLAYTHINGS In the cultivation of the crops our men and women toil together.
('53', 425, 1, 14, 837855) Their life is a strenuous one.
('53', 425, 1, 15, 837886) It is in the leisured classes that the difference is more marked.
('53', 425, 1, 16, 837952) Wealth has enabled women to forget and set aside the virtue of usefulness.
('53', 425, 1, 17, 838027) Thus there is a tendency for wealthy women to become mere ornaments playthings.
('53', 425, 1, 18, 838107) What I want to see is the opening of all offices, professions and employments to women; otherwise there can be no real equality.
('53', 425, 1, 19, 838236) But I most sincerely hope that woman will retain and exercise her ancient prerogative as queen of the household.
('53', 425, 1, 20, 838349) From this position she must never be dethroned.
('53', 425, 1, 21, 838397) It would indeed be a dreary home of which a woman was not the centre.
('53', 425, 1, 22, 838467) I cannot, for instance, imagine a really happy home in which the wife is a typist and scarcely ever in it.
('53', 425, 1, 23, 838574) Who would look after the children?
('53', 425, 1, 24, 838609) What, after all, is a home without children, the brightest jewels in the poorest household?
('53', 425, 1, 25, 838701) FAMILY FIRST Cases might be cited in which a clever woman might, by going out into the world to earn her living, make more money and do more for the children, paying someone to look after them.
('53', 425, 1, 26, 838895) Exceptional women make necessarily exceptional cases.
('53', 425, 1, 27, 838949) There are exceptions in every phase of life.
('53', 425, 1, 28, 838994) but we cannot generalize from exceptions.
('53', 425, 1, 29, 839036) Generally, it is the father who should be the bread winner.
('53', 425, 1, 30, 839096) He will work all the better, knowing that he has a happy home.
('53', 425, 1, 31, 839159) And it is aserious injustice to deprive a child of the tender care which only a mother can give.

('53', 426, 1, 2, 839300) It is a womans work to bring up her little ones and mould their character.
('53', 426, 1, 3, 839375) A precious work, too.
('53', 426, 1, 4, 839397) Equality in status with men, I desire for women, but if the mother fails in her sacred trust towards her children, then nothing can atone for the loss.
('53', 426, 1, 5, 839549) Whatever the race, family life is the first and greatest thing.
('53', 426, 1, 6, 839613) Its sanctity must remain.
('53', 426, 1, 7, 839639) Upon it rests the welfare of the nation.
('53', 426, 1, 8, 839680) For good or for ill home influence persists.
('53', 426, 1, 9, 839725) Of that there can be no possible doubt, and no State can survive unless the sacred security of its home life is preserved.
('53', 426, 1, 10, 839848) Individuals there may be who in pursuit of some great principle or ideal, forgo, like myself, the solace of family life, choosing instead one of self sacrifice and celibacy; but for the mass of the people the preservation of home life is essential.

('53', 426, 3, 13, 840206) DEAR SIR SAMUEL, Enclosed you will find copies of three cables 1 that I found awaiting me on my return from Lancashire this morning.
('53', 426, 3, 14, 840339) They illustrate what I tried to explain the other day.
('53', 426, 3, 15, 840394) You will find in the cables mention of Mr. Birlas name.
('53', 426, 3, 16, 840450) He is well versed in matters of finance.
('53', 426, 3, 17, 840491) I would suggest a meeting between Sir Henry Strakosch and Mr. Birla and other Indians versed in currency questions.
('53', 426, 4, 18, 840607) If the Government of India have a good case, I should imagine that they should have no difficulty in satisfying these Indian experts.
('53', 426, 4, 19, 840741) Mr. Vallabhbhai is Sardar Patel, President of the Congress.
('53', 426, 5, 20, 840801) Yours Sincerely, Encl.

('53', 427, 8, 14, 841941) On the strength of these cables, I have sent a letter to the Secretary of State 1. I enclose herewith copy of that letter too.

('53', 427, 8, 20, 842503) What I have felt is that, in many vital matters, I must not count upon your support.
('53', 427, 8, 21, 842588) Nothing would please me more than to know that I was mistaken in so thinking.
('53', 427, 8, 22, 842666) Add to this belief my retiring nature and you have the whole reason for my apparent aloofness.

('53', 432, 6, 11, 848270) We recognize that these 31 political prisoners were arrested in March, 1929, because they led the revolt of the Indian workers against the intolerable conditions of employment which exist, and were successfully building trade union organizations which were a real challenge both to British Imperialism and to the Indian exploiters.
('53', 432, 6, 12, 848602) These prisoners have been detained on trial for over two years; some hundreds of witnesses have been called, and many thousands of pounds have been spent by the Government on the prosecution of these heroic standard bearers of the working class.
('53', 432, 6, 13, 848848) Not only do we demand their unconditional and immediate release, but we further demand the immediate release of the Garhwali Riflemen who gallantly refused to fire on an unarmed gathering of their fellow countrymen, and as a consequence have been sentenced to lifelong terms of imprisonment.

('53', 435, 3, 5, 851790) 1 Of course if I could persuade India to revert to methods of barter, it would be a capital thing, but I do not think I would get any response just now.
('53', 435, 3, 6, 851943) There are, however, many things possible in that direction and these are being tried.
('53', 435, 3, 7, 852029) As I am dictating this letter against time, I am not going into details.
('53', 435, 3, 8, 852102) You see I am dictating this in London.
('53', 435, 3, 9, 852141) I came because I felt that it was a clear call from God, and if I could describe to you in detail how I was led to London, even you would be surprised how it all happened when it seemed to have utterly broken down.

('53', 435, 4, 16, 852791) Recently I have wondered whether, after India gets her freedom it might not be a great relief to the peasantry to let them pay their taxes in the form of a percentage of their crops, as was done centuries ago.
('53', 435, 4, 17, 853001) .Recently I talked with an English friend of mine who used to be a teacher at Harvard College .
('53', 435, 4, 18, 853097) his name is H.J.Laski.
('53', 435, 4, 19, 853120) He told me that he was Mr. Justice Sankeys chief secretarial assistant at the first Round Table Conference.
('53', 435, 4, 20, 853228) Apparently he has hypnotized himself into thinking that the financial safeguards there proposed would work out to be entirely in Indian control, though how any honest Englishman with a knowledge of Magna Carta could think so is beyond my comprehension.
('53', 435, 4, 21, 853481) And now that the Government have put Malaviyaji upon the list of delegates, I think the British Government believe that Malaviyaji has more influence with you than any other Indian who is pliable to them, and so they will work on you through Irwin on one side and Malaviyaji on the other..
('53', 435, 4, 22, 853771) Those two men, as men, may be wholly sincere but I do not think they know the falsities and horrors of the system they are trying to preserve.

('53', 436, 5, 10, 854603) DEAR FRIEND, I thank you for your letter of the 13th inst.
('53', 436, 5, 11, 854662) I think the meaning of Dominion Status you have quoted is admirable.
('53', 436, 5, 12, 854731) 1 What, however, the Indian National Congress is aiming at, is a Partnership or Alliance.
('53', 436, 5, 13, 854821) Dominions are generally English speaking peoples, or they are otherwise called daughter nations.
('53', 436, 5, 14, 854918) India is in that sense an alien nation, therefore she can only be legitimately a partner or an ally.
('53', 436, 5, 15, 855019) The statement attributed to me and quoted by you 2 is the opposite of what I have repeated from thousands of platforms.
('53', 436, 5, 16, 855139) Non violence is an absolute creed.
('53', 436, 5, 17, 855174) I could not therefore have said anything that could detract in any way from the value of that creed.
('53', 436, 5, 18, 855275) Violence is excluded by the Congress voluntarily because the Congress has come
('53', 436, 6, 19, 855354) 1 The addressee, a senior at Barnard College, Columbia University, had quoted Lord Balfours definition of Dominion status as autonomous communities within the British Empire, equal in status, and in no way subordinate, one to the other, in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs, though united by a common allegiance to the Crown, and freely associated as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations. She had asked Gandhiji to give his own definition of the concept.
('53', 436, 6, 20, 855834) 2 It read: Three hundred and sixty million people without liberty cannot remain in the leashes of non violence for ever. Vide Interview to the Associated Press, 11 9 1931.

('53', 437, 1, 2, 856048) to the conclusion that it is the right thing, but the mere fact of England and India being members of the League of Nations surely does not exclude the possibility of violence if either nation is minded to offer violence England in order to retain her hold on India, and India in order to get out of that hold.
('53', 437, 1, 3, 856359) Even as it is, today India is only nominally a member of the League; she is not a member in her own right, but she is a member under English patronage and at the will of Great Britain.

('53', 437, 7, 11, 856837) If you would come to 88 Knightsbridge some day at 10 a.m., I would try and give you just a few minutes.

('53', 439, 11, 18, 859599) rights equal to those enjoyed by Indians born in India.
('53', 439, 11, 19, 859655) He had suggested that citizenship should be so defined as to exclude the citizens of what we may call the Anti Indian Colonies.

('53', 441, 2, 3, 860977) LONDON, September 30, 1931
('53', 441, 3, 4, 861004) Gandhi showed no sign of any intention to break up the Conference.
('53', 441, 3, 5, 861071) What he complained of was that the Conference was futile because the other delegates were only the nominees of Government and he was the sole genuine representative of the people.
('53', 441, 3, 6, 861251) He thought that he could represent the Muslims and the Depressed Classes better than those who purported to do so.
('53', 441, 3, 7, 861366) He and the British Government could settle the whole question if he was treated as representing everybody.
('53', 441, 3, 8, 861473) The Prime Minister said that the Conference had at any rate been successful in so far as it had got Gandhi to come to London and brought him into touch with the Government; and he countered by telling Gandhi that the civil disobedience movement was a mistake and only hindered the British Government from carrying out their intentions towards India.

('53', 441, 6, 11, 861928) LONDON, September 30, 1931
('53', 441, 7, 12, 861955) Gandhiji said he was well aware of the sacrifices made by the merchants of India in national interests, but, much as they had done, still more was expected by the nation.
('53', 441, 7, 13, 862126) Paying a tribute to Dadabhoy Naoroji and Sir Pherozeshah Mehta, Gandhiji said those great leaders recognized that, unless the merchant princes in India identified themselves with the Congress activities, progress towards freedom would be delayed.
('53', 441, 8, 14, 862373) Gandhiji proceeded to criticize the financial manipulation undertaken by the Government of India at the dictation of the Secretary of State over the heads of those who knew what India wanted and said: I share your fear that, at this time, when we are led to ex pect a transfer of power to ourselves, there does not after all appear to be much of a change at the headquarters.
('53', 441, 8, 15, 862749) I am afraid power is not going to descend on us suddenly, but if really great changes are

('53', 442, 1, 2, 863063) contemplated by His Majestys advisers, we should have a foretaste in matters like this.
('53', 442, 1, 3, 863151) The Congress came deliberately to the conclusion that, without absolute control of the finances, no self governmemt could possibly meet the nations needs.
('53', 442, 1, 4, 863306) Part of the mandate given me was that Independence was meaningless unless accompanied by complete control of defence, external affairs and finance.
('53', 442, 1, 5, 863454) I cannot conceive of any government, which can be called responsible, which does not exercise those rights.
('53', 442, 2, 6, 863562) He assured British firms trading in India that, where their interests were legitimately and justly acquired and not conflicting with the vital interests of the masses, they need have no fear from the National Government.
('53', 442, 2, 7, 863783) No safeguard can possibly equal Indias goodwill.
('53', 442, 2, 8, 863832) Nobody who wishes to remain in India when she has acquired full freedom can come to harm if he depends upon goodwill, without which other safeguards, however carefully worded, would not be worth the paper on which they were written.
('53', 442, 2, 9, 864065) Such safeguards would be a hindrance rather than a help in the solution of the great problem to which the delegates are applying their minds.
('53', 442, 3, 10, 864207) Regarding the communal question, where the position was admittedly serious, Gandhiji said the Congress had laid down its own policy in the clearest possible terms in the Lahore resolution, supplemented by the Working Committee.
('53', 442, 4, 11, 864435) I can only add a personal assurance that, so far as humanly possible, I shall leave no stone unturned to reach a solution, but I cannot conceal from you that I find myself confronted with the greatest difficulties.
('53', 442, 4, 12, 864650) I can only seek your prayerful assistance and whatever influence you can exert upon the different communities.

('53', 444, 8, 14, 867425) LONDON, October 1, 1931 At this distance it is difficult to understand the implications of the budget, but I am horrified that the poor mans salt has also come in for increased taxation.
('53', 444, 8, 15, 867612) I know, the Congress will fight this also.
('53', 444, 8, 16, 867655) The remedy for balancing the budget does not lie through increased taxation, but through radical retrenchment in both military and civil expenditure.
('53', 444, 8, 17, 867805) I tender congratulations to H.E. the Viceroy for having voluntarily accepted a cut in his salary, but I cannot escape the feeling that reduction must be on a grand scale if India is to share in real self government.

('53', 445, 2, 3, 868285) LONDON, October 1, 1931
('53', 445, 3, 4, 868309) Mr. Gandhi said that the money would be devoted to the constructive work of the Congress.
('53', 445, 3, 5, 868399) Millions of Indians were so sunk in poverty that it was almost impossible to inspire them with any hope of earning their own livelihood and the task of the Congress was formidable.
('53', 445, 3, 6, 868580) If he could persuade the people to become self sufficient in respect of the second necessity of life, namely, clothing, they would have a real swaraj.
('53', 445, 4, 7, 868731) (1) Complete Independence is the present objective of the Congress.
('53', 445, 4, 8, 868799) My mission here is to ask for immediate independence, but that does not exclude partnership with Britain on absolutely equal terms to be terminated at will.
('53', 445, 4, 9, 868956) I would consider that complete independence.
('53', 445, 4, 10, 869001) (2) What the Congress meant (by the Lahore resolution) was severance from the British Empire which is not the same thing as severance of even honourable partnership with Great Britain.
('53', 445, 4, 11, 869186) India will not belong to an Empire if it means that India becomes a subject nation, but India will be be honourable partner with Great Britain if both India and Great Britain so desire.
('53', 445, 4, 12, 869372) That India desires it is plain from the fact that I have come here to ask for Complete Independence, not excluding the idea of partnership if it is equally desired by Great Britain.
('53', 445, 4, 13, 869554) (3) The Independence Section is represented by me on behalf of the Congress.
('53', 445, 4, 14, 869631) (4) The Indian States subjects are not being represented by representatives appointed or elected by them.
('53', 445, 4, 15, 869737) I have a mission on behalf of these subjects of Indian States which I hope to fulfil according to my lights and my ability.
('53', 445, 4, 16, 869861) (5) I must say that I do not consider myself to be quite so

('53', 445, 5, 18, 870022) Vithalbhai Patel presided.
('53', 445, 5, 19, 870049) A purse of  575 was presented to Gandhiji.
('53', 445, 5, 20, 870092) 2 The report of Gandhijis answers which follows is from Amrita Bazar Patrika, 30 10 1931.

('53', 446, 1, 2, 870226) simple as to imagine that I can get independence for India by entering into a bargain of such an insignificant character compared with what I seek.
('53', 446, 1, 3, 870374) My offer of preference for British cloth to other foreign cloths is based upon its own merits and the merits are these: that if I have Great Britain as my partner, even as I would prefer Indian cloth to any other cloth so would I prefer the cloth produced by my partner to that produced by those who are not my partners.
('53', 446, 1, 4, 870695) (6) I propose to devote all my energies, when the question of franchise comes up before the Federal Structure Committee, to making good the point that I have adumbrated, i.e., showing that adult suffrage is an immediate possibility through the method that I have planned.
('53', 446, 1, 5, 870967) I am not able to say with absolute certainty that the whole of the Working Committee shares my views but it comes under the powers given to me by the Working Committee that I may use my discretion in the method of reaching adult suffrage.
('53', 446, 1, 6, 871206) My hands are tied so far as adult suffrage is concerned; they are not tied in so far as the methods are concerned.
('53', 446, 1, 7, 871321) There are some members of the Working Committee who do not actually know what I mean by the method.
('53', 446, 1, 8, 871421) (7) I have already placed before the Government the written mandate of the Congress which embodies the whole of its demands wihout reservation whatsoever.
('53', 446, 1, 9, 871576) The Government has not yet laid its cards upon the table, but the time is fast coming when the Governments policy will also have to be declared one way or the other because I expect that all the members of the Round Table Conference, busy as they are, are not going to give up the whole of their time here in idle expectation of something turning up on the morrow, I have definite instructions not to idle my time here.
('53', 446, 1, 10, 871996) Therefore, as soon as I find that I cannot usefully remain here, I shall have to return to India.
('53', 446, 1, 11, 872094) (8) The Garhwali prisoners (as they are called) deliberately disobeyed their orders.
('53', 446, 1, 12, 872179) I agree that it was a non violent action on their part, but it was also a gross breach of discipline by those who had taken an oath to carry out the commands of their officers.
('53', 446, 1, 13, 872356) So long as the present Government remains, however, I have not

('53', 447, 1, 2, 872461) the heart to go to them to say you must release them.
('53', 447, 1, 3, 872515) I can say: your punishment is too heavy for the crime.
('53', 447, 1, 4, 872570) After all, they thought the orders were mischievous.
('53', 447, 1, 5, 872623) They might have been satisfied with the right punishment.
('53', 447, 1, 6, 872681) I am not going at this stage to confer with the Government about this thing.
('53', 447, 1, 7, 872758) If I get the thing for which I have been sent here, I can do this thing, but otherwise it is [not] in conflict with the conduct of the campaign itself that some men may suffer imprisonment, even life servitude.
('53', 447, 1, 8, 872969) (9) Please understand that I have tried my level best in the manner that I know is consistent with the dignity of the nation in connection with the Meerut prisoners.

('53', 447, 4, 12, 873312) LONDON, October 1, 1931
('53', 447, 5, 13, 873336) MR. GANDHI : Prime Minister, after consultation with His Highness the Aga Khan and other Muslim friends last night, we came to the con clusion that the purpose for which we meet here would be better served if a weeks adjournment was asked for.
('53', 447, 5, 14, 873580) I have not had the opportunity of consulting my other colleagues, but I have no doubt that they will also agree to the proposal I am making.
('53', 447, 5, 15, 873721) I have been having my Muslim friends anxious conversations, and I had the pleasure of meeting some other friends also, last afternoon, belonging to the different groups or classes.
('53', 447, 5, 16, 873902) We were not able to make much headway, but they too felt that the time at our disposal was too short even for exchanging views.
('53', 447, 5, 17, 874030) I may say for myself that beyond this weeks adjournment I would not press for any further adjournment, but I would report to this Committee what has been the result of the endeavour I shall be making during the week.
('53', 447, 6, 18, 874247) 1 According to a Reuter report, towards the end of the meeting, some Indian communists caused pandemonium resulting in their forcible ejection.
('53', 448, 0, 1, 874391) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 449
('53', 448, 1, 2, 874435) I let out no secret when I inform this Committee that His Highness and the other friends with whom I was closeted last night laid upon my shoulders the burden of calling representatives of the different groups together and holding consultations with a view to arriving at some final settlement.
('53', 448, 1, 3, 874730) If this poropsal of mine commends itself to you, Prime Minister, and to the rest of the members of this Committee, I shall be glad.
('53', 448, 1, 4, 874862) I know that His Highness will second this proposal, and let us all hope that, at the end of the week, it will be possible to report some sort of a settlement.
('53', 448, 1, 5, 875021) When I express this hope, I do not wish to convey any impression that, because I express it, there is something that I know and on which I am building that hope.
('53', 448, 1, 6, 875183) But I am an irrepressible optimist, and often in my lifetime when the horizon has appeared to be the blackest, some turn has taken place which has given good ground for hope.
('53', 448, 1, 7, 875358) Whatever it may be, so far as human endeavour is possible, all that endeavour will be made, I have no doubt, by many members of this Committee to arrive at a settlement.
('53', 448, 1, 8, 875528) With these words I leave my proposal, that we adjourn our proceedings to this day week, in your hands for consideration.
('53', 448, 2, 9, 875649) H.H. THE AGA KHAN : I have pleasure in seconding the proposal.
('53', 448, 3, 10, 875712) SARDAR UJJAL SINGH : I rise to give my whole hearted support to this proposal, and I share the hope that by this means we may come to some understanding, given goodwill on both sides.
('53', 448, 4, 11, 875896) AMBEDKAR: I do not wish to create any difficulty in our making every possible attempt to arrive at some solution of the problem with which this Committee has to deal, and if a solution can be arrived at by the means suggested by Mahatma Gandhi, I, for one, will have no objection to that proposal.
('53', 448, 5, 12, 876194) But there is just this one difficulty with which, I, as representing the Depressed Classes, am faced.
('53', 448, 5, 13, 876296) I do not know what sort of committee Mahatma Gandhi proposes to appoint to consider this question during the period of adjournment, but I suppose that the Depressed Casses will be represented on this Committee.
('53', 448, 6, 14, 876507) MR. GANDHI: Without doubt.
('53', 448, 7, 15, 876534) 1 All the speakers that followed generally supported the adjournment motion, but Dr. Ambedkar, Sir Henry Gidney and Rao Bahadur Pannirselvam, though they did not oppose the adjournment, said that since Gandhiji recognized only two to minority communities, namely, the Muslims and the Sikhs, they did not see how they could participate in the work of the committee which Gandhiji proposed to form for the purpose of unofficial consultations.
('53', 449, 0, 1, 876975) 450 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 449, 1, 2, 877017) Prime Minister and friends, I see that there is some kind of misunderstanding with reference to the scope of the work that some of us have set before ourselves.
('53', 449, 1, 3, 877178) I fear that Dr. Ambedkar, Colonel Gidney and other friends are unnecessarily nervous about what is going to happen.
('53', 449, 1, 4, 877294) Who am I to deny political status to any single interest or class or even individual in India ?
('53', 449, 1, 5, 877390) As a representative of the Congress I should be unworthy of the trust that has been reposed in me by the Congress if I were guilty of sacrificing a single national interest.
('53', 449, 1, 6, 877564) I have undoubtedly given expression to my own views on these points.
('53', 449, 1, 7, 877633) I must confess that I hold to those views also.
('53', 449, 1, 8, 877681) But there are ways and ways of guaranteeing protection to every single interest.
('53', 449, 1, 9, 877762) It will be for those of us who will be putting our heads together to try to evolve a scheme.
('53', 449, 1, 10, 877855) Nobody would be hampered in pressing his own views on the members of this very informal conference or meeting.
('53', 449, 1, 11, 877966) We need not call it a committee.
('53', 449, 1, 12, 877999) I have no authority to convene any committee or to bring into being a committee.
('53', 449, 1, 13, 878080) I can only act as a humble messenger of peace, try to get together representatives of different interests and groups, and see whether, by being closeted in one room and by heart to heart conversation, we may not be able to remove cobwebs of misunderstanding and see our way clear to the goal that lies so hazily before us today.
('53', 449, 1, 14, 878409) I do not think, therefore, that anybody need be afraid as to being able to excess his opinion or carrying his opinion also.
('53', 449, 1, 15, 878533) Mine will be there equal to that of everyone of us; it will carry no greater weight; I have no authority behind me to carry my opinion against the opinion of anybody.
('53', 449, 1, 16, 878700) I have simply given expression to my views in the national interest, and I shall give expression to these views whenever they are opportune.
('53', 449, 1, 17, 878841) It will be for you, it is for you to reject or accept those opinions.
('53', 449, 1, 18, 878911) Therefore please disabuse your minds, everyone of us, of the idea that there is going to be any steam rolling in the Conference and the informal meetings that I have adumbrated.
('53', 449, 1, 19, 879089) But if you think that this is one way of coming closer together than by sitting stiffly at this table, you will not only carry this adjournment motion, but give your whole hearted co operation to the proposal that I have made in connection with these informal meetings.

('53', 450, 5, 7, 879757) LONDON, [Before October 2, 1931] I have a world of friends among the jews.
('53', 450, 5, 8, 879832) In South Africa I was surrounded by Jews, and I have had a Jewish shorthand writer and typist who was regarded more as a member of the family.
('53', 450, 5, 9, 879975) I cannot, however, say that I have made a proper study of the Jewish religion, but I have studied as much as a layman can.
('53', 450, 5, 10, 880098) I think the Jewish religion is a very fine religion, being so closely allied to Christianity in many respects.
('53', 450, 5, 11, 880209) For example, the Prophets of the old Testament are all Jews, and Jesus himself was a Jew.
('53', 450, 5, 12, 880299) I visited the Synagogue at Johannesburg during the Festival of the Passover, and you can almost say I was keeping the Passover with my Jewish friends, because I went to their house every night and I heartily enjoyed, what do you call them now?
('53', 450, 6, 13, 880543) Matzos, interjected our representative.
('53', 450, 6, 14, 880583) Yes, matzos, I think matzos are very nice and crisp.
('53', 450, 6, 15, 880636) I have,however, attended two or three Jewish services, which I think are very impressive; but my own feeling is that the heart was lacking.
('53', 450, 6, 16, 880776) That is to say, the spirit was lacking.
('53', 450, 6, 17, 880816) They were too ceremonial, although I must say the ceremony was very nice.
('53', 450, 6, 18, 880890) The Jewish Rabbi was a celebrated scholar, and he delivered a learned discourse, but it did not touch my herart .
('53', 450, 6, 19, 881004) My attitude towards Jews is one of great sympathy.
('53', 450, 6, 20, 881055) I am very much attracted to the Jews, firstly, because of selfish motives, since I have very many Jewish friends; secondly,for a far deeper onethey
('53', 450, 7, 21, 881203) 1 This note was made by Gandhiji on a letter dated October 1, 1931 from the addressee inviting him to lunch at a meeting of the Fruitarian Society, Doddington, Kent.
('53', 450, 7, 22, 881369) The meeting according to a further letter from Clare was to be held at Grosvenor House Hotel, London.
('53', 451, 0, 1, 881471) 452 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 451, 1, 2, 881513) have got a wonderful spirit of cohesion.
('53', 451, 1, 3, 881554) That is to say, wherever you find Jews there is a spirit of comradeship among them.
('53', 451, 1, 4, 881638) Moreover, they are a people with a vision.
('53', 451, 1, 5, 881681) The implication and full meaning of that vision, if I may put it without impertinence, they do not themselves realize.
('53', 451, 1, 6, 881800) I am sometimes asked whether I regard Jews as the Chosen People, and I say, well, in a sense, yes.
('53', 451, 1, 7, 881899) But then all peoples consider themselves to be chosen.
('53', 451, 1, 8, 881954) Zionism in its spiritual sense is a lofty aspiration.
('53', 451, 1, 9, 882008) By spiri tual sense I mean they should want to realize the Jerusalem that is within.
('53', 451, 1, 10, 882093) Zionism meaning reoccupation of Palestine has no attraction for me.
('53', 451, 1, 11, 882161) I can understand the longing of a Jew to return to Palestine, and he can do so if he can without the help of bayonets, whether his own or those of Britain.
('53', 451, 1, 12, 882317) In that event he would go to Palestine peacefully and in perfect friendliness with the Arabs.
('53', 451, 1, 13, 882411) The real Zionism of which I have given you my meaning is the thing to strive for, long for and die for.
('53', 451, 1, 14, 882515) Zion lies in ones heart.
('53', 451, 1, 15, 882540) It is the abode of God.
('53', 451, 1, 16, 882564) The real Jerusalem is the spiritual Jerusalem.
('53', 451, 1, 17, 882611) Thus he can realize this Zionism in any part of the world.
('53', 451, 2, 18, 882670) Mr. Gandhi added that unfortunately he had not been to Palestine yet but that he hoped to go there some day.
('53', 451, 2, 19, 882779) I should love to go, for I have read so much about the Holy Land.
('53', 451, 2, 20, 882845) Anti Semitism is really a remnant of barbarism.
('53', 451, 2, 21, 882893) I have never been able to understand this antipathy to the Jews.
('53', 451, 2, 22, 882958) I have read Zangwills Children of the Ghetto, and when I read it, I realized what unmerited persecution Jews had already gone through and I felt then as I feel now that this persecution is, if I can again say so in all humility, a reflection upon those who, in the name of Christianity, have persecuted this long suffering race.
('53', 451, 2, 23, 883287) The remedy?
('53', 451, 2, 24, 883299) My remedy is twofold.
('53', 451, 2, 25, 883321) One is that those who profess to be Christians should learn the virtue of toleration and charity, and the second is for Jews to rid themselves of the causes for such reproach as may be justly laid at their door.

('53', 452, 2, 3, 883640) LONDON, [October 2, 1931] 1
('53', 452, 3, 4, 883668) The drink question in India is most urgent.
('53', 452, 3, 5, 883712) The religious teachings of both Hindus and Mohammedans require abstinence from alcoholic liquors.
('53', 452, 3, 6, 883810) The future all India Legislature would certainly regard it as ess ential to prohibit the importation, manufacture, or sale of all alcoholic beverages, subject to an exemption which would permit the supply of alcohol for medicinal, scientific, and industrial uses.
('53', 452, 3, 7, 884074) The supply for medicinal purposes would be dependent on a medical prescription.
('53', 452, 3, 8, 884154) Prohibition must apply equally to distillation in India and to imports of liquor from overseas.
('53', 452, 4, 9, 884250) I asked Mr. Gandhi how he would propose to deal with the question of the substantial revenue which Government in India derives from liquor taxation.
('53', 452, 4, 10, 884399) He replied that this revenue should be replaced by a corresponding cut in the Indian military budget.
('53', 452, 5, 11, 884501) We discussed different methods of approach to a solution of the Indian liquor problem.
('53', 452, 5, 12, 884588) I pointed out that in England we stressed the importance of scientific teaching in the schools as to the nature of alcohol and the effect of alcoholic indulgence.
('53', 452, 5, 13, 884751) Mr. Gandhi said that to a limited extent instruction on the subject was given in Indian schools, but he was disposed to rely on the religious sentiment of the country as sufficient to maintain the national protest against the use of drink.
('53', 452, 5, 14, 884991) He regarded the increase of drinking in India as closely associated with industrialization, and stressed the fact that depressing industrial conditions favour the prevalence of alcoholism.
('53', 452, 6, 15, 885180) Local option and national prohibition seem to him to differ in this way : In a country like Britain, where the liquor habit is rooted in history, and where probably the majority of people are users of liquor, local option might be applicable .
('53', 452, 6, 16, 885424) But India needs no intermediate policy; she is ready or the enactment of complete national prohibition.
('53', 452, 6, 17, 885528) The sentiment of the country would unquestionably sustain it.
('53', 452, 7, 18, 885590) With regard to the opium habit, he pointed out that this is not now as widely diffused in India as the alcohol habit.
('53', 452, 7, 19, 885708) The growth of the poppy has diminished in

('53', 453, 1, 2, 885862) recent years.
('53', 453, 1, 3, 885876) The Government has rationed the export of opium, so that opium exports decrease by 10 per cent annually.
('53', 453, 1, 4, 885981) This has been a wise and salutary measure.
('53', 453, 1, 5, 886024) Mr. Gandhi said : The opium habit is indigenous, but the moral sense of the Indian people would require early, thoroughgoing prohibitive action in this regard also.
('53', 453, 1, 6, 886189) National prohibition of opium for use in India is requisite, except in so far as opium is required strictly for medicinal and scientific purposes.

('53', 453, 2, 8, 886372) 498. SPEECH AT LUNCHEON 1
('53', 453, 3, 9, 886398) LONDON, October 2, 1931 Ever since I have come to London I have experienced nothing but friendliness and genuine affection.
('53', 453, 3, 10, 886522) I have been making new friends from day to day.
('53', 453, 3, 11, 886570) But you, sir, have reminded me that you have been friends in need, and friends in need are really friends indeed.
('53', 453, 3, 12, 886684) When it appeared that India, or rather Congressmen, might be abandoned by nearly everybody on earth, you stood by the Congress firmly and accepted the Congress position as your own.
('53', 453, 3, 13, 886866) You have today renewed your faith in the Congress programme and thereby you have lightened my labours.
('53', 453, 3, 14, 886969) It would be like carrying coals to Newcastle to deliver to you the message for which I have been sent here as the Congress representative.
('53', 453, 3, 15, 887108) You know all about the merits of the Congress case and I am convinced that the Congress case is quite safe in your hands and you have by todays action set the seal upon the friendship, through the Congress, of the dumb and semi starved millions of Indias villages.
('53', 453, 3, 16, 887373) It is imagined that you have attended a lunch.
('53', 453, 3, 17, 887420) My sympathies are wholly with you.
('53', 453, 3, 18, 887455) I am accustomed to English lunches not through the taste but through the eyes, and when I saw this fruit laden table, I
('53', 453, 4, 19, 887575) 1 The luncheon, to mark Gandhijis 62nd birthday, was arranged by the Independent Labour Party, the Indian National Congress League and The Gandhi Society, at the Westminister Palace rooms.
('53', 453, 4, 20, 887764) Fenner Brockway was in the chair.
('53', 453, 4, 21, 887798) Altogether 388 persons were present.
('53', 453, 4, 22, 887835) A charkha was presented to Gandhiji on the occasion.

('53', 454, 1, 2, 887932) realized what a sacrifice it was for you to take what is an apology for a luncheon.
('53', 454, 1, 3, 888016) I hope that the spirit of sacrifice will forbear until tea time comes and you provide yourselves with any little delicacies that English hotels and restaurants provide for you.
('53', 454, 1, 4, 888193) But behind this apparent joke there is also seriousness.
('53', 454, 1, 5, 888250) I know that you have sacrificed something.
('53', 454, 1, 6, 888293) Some of you have sacrificed much for advocating the cause of Indias independence understanding the word independence in its full English sense.
('53', 454, 1, 7, 888437) But it may be that you will be called upon, in you continue your advocacy of Indias cause, to make much larger sacrifices.
('53', 454, 1, 8, 888560) I entertained no illusions in my mind when I undertook to come here.
('53', 454, 1, 9, 888629) You heard me say on the first day of my entry into London that one of the most potent causes of my having come to London was to fulfil a word of honour that I had given to an honourable Englishman1 and in pursuance of that word, without thinking what the result is likely to be, I am endeavouring to the utmost of my ability, to show to every Englishman 1 and Englishwoman I meet that what the Congress stands for is what is deserved by India and, furthermore, I am endeavouring to show that the Congress is in earnest and I am here to vindicate the honour of the Congress, the honour of India, by asking for everything that is included in the Congress mandate.
('53', 454, 1, 10, 889291) I should have no liberty to diminish anything from the Congress claim, save to the extent that is permissible in that mandate and that being so, I feel, the more I stay here, that the task is difficult almost superhuman.
('53', 454, 1, 11, 889512) There is so much ignorance of the conditions that prevail in India.
('53', 454, 1, 12, 889580) There is so much ignorance of true history.
('53', 454, 1, 13, 889624) As a Quaker young friend reminded me, when I was about to come here, that it was no use coming here so long as from childhood you were brought up, not on truthful real history, but upon false history, and I see that truth uttered by that Quaker friend exemplified as I come into contact with Englishmen and Enlishwomen.
('53', 454, 1, 14, 889944) It is terribly difficult, almost impossible, for them to realize that, at least so far as Indians are concerned, they believe that the sum total of the activities of British administration in India has been harmful rather than beneficial to the nation.
('53', 454, 1, 15, 890197) It is no use pointing out the benefit that India might have received from the British connection.
('53', 454, 1, 16, 890295) It is of vital importance to sum up the pros and cons and find out how

('53', 455, 1, 2, 890421) India has fared.
('53', 455, 1, 3, 890438) I have placed two infallible tests : Is it or is it not a fact that India today is the poorest country in the world, having millions of people remaining idle for six months of the year?
('53', 455, 1, 4, 890624) Is it or is it not a fact that India has been rendered emasculated not merely through compulsory disarmament,but also through being denied so many opportunities that members of a free nation are always entitled to?
('53', 455, 1, 5, 890839) If you find upon investigation that in these two cases England has failed, I do not say hopelessly, but to a very large extent, is it not time that England revised her policy?
('53', 455, 1, 6, 891015) As a friend said, and as the late Lokamanya Tilak said repeat edly from thousands of platforms: Freedom and independence were Indias birthright. It is not necessary for me to prove that British rule has been in the end British misrule.
('53', 455, 1, 7, 891251) It is only enough for me to state that, misrule or good rule, India is entitled to her independence immediately, there is a demand made for it on behalf of her voiceless millions.
('53', 455, 1, 8, 891431) It is no answer to be told that there are some in India who are afraid of the words freedom and independence.
('53', 455, 1, 9, 891541) There are some of us, and I admit there are some of us, who are afraid of talking about the freedom of India if the British protection so called is withdrawn from India.
('53', 455, 1, 10, 891711) But I assure you that the starving millions and those who have become politically conscious entertain no such fear and they are ready to pay the price for the sake of freedom.
('53', 455, 1, 11, 891887) There are, however, well marked limitations so long as the Congress retains her present workers and her faith in her present policy.
('53', 455, 1, 12, 892020) We do not want the freedom of India if it is to be bought through the sacrifice of the lives of others if it is to be bought by spilling the blood of the rulers.
('53', 455, 1, 13, 892182) But if any sacrifice can be made by the nation, by ourselves, to win that freedom, then you will find that we will not hesitate to give a Gangesful of blood to flow in India in order to vindicate the freedom that has been so long delayed, and I know, as you, sir, reminded me, that I was not a stranger in your midst, but that I was a comrade.
('53', 455, 1, 14, 892526) I know that I have this absolute assurance that so far as you are concerned and those whom you represent are concerned, you would always stand by us and prove once more to India that you are friends in need and therefore friends indeed.

('53', 456, 4, 7, 893213) Mr.Gandhi on behalf of the Congress also opposed special representation to the Depressed Classes.
('53', 456, 4, 8, 893311) He said, he would support special representation only for Muslims and Sikhs as a necessary evil.
('53', 456, 5, 9, 893408) It appears that Mr. Gandhi warned the Conference that, if special re presentation was conceded, it must be conceded to all minorities.

('53', 456, 7, 12, 893598) LONDON, October 2,1931
('53', 456, 8, 13, 893621) Mr. Gandhi, who arrived three quarters of an hour late, explained that he had been attending the informal minorities conciliation committee.
('53', 456, 8, 14, 893762) He said: I have undertaken work of very considerable responsibility and I could not tear myself away from a meeting that I was attending in connection with the very mission that has brought me from India.
('53', 456, 9, 15, 893967) Mr. Gandhi said, there were 700,000 villages in India where the people lived under ill nourished conditions.
('53', 456, 9, 16, 894076) One of the best constructive activities of the Congress was that of bringing work to the workless women of the villages, irrespective of race, caste or creed.
('53', 456, 9, 17, 894235) Probably at the present moment some 50,000 women were being given the work of spinning in their own homes.

('53', 456, 10, 20, 894745) Mrs. Brijlal Nehru was in the chair.
('53', 456, 10, 21, 894782) A purse of  165 was presented to Gandhiji on the occasion.

('53', 457, 1, 2, 894883) work in India was more important than that of banishing pauperism by giving the men and women not doles or charity but work.
('53', 457, 1, 3, 895008) The great mass of villagers were without work for six months in the year.
('53', 457, 1, 4, 895082) When they thought of this chronic unemployment, the unemployment in England dwindled into insignificance.
('53', 457, 1, 5, 895188) He did not wish to underrate the difficulties arising in in this country from unemployment, such as he had seen in Lancashire, but he did say that the unemployment in India deserved the sympathy and assistance of the whole world.
('53', 457, 1, 6, 895418) He did not mean material sympathy: if they in India could give work to their people, there would be no need of money, for labour was another form of money.
('53', 457, 1, 7, 895574) Mr.Gandhi paid a tribute to the noble part the women of India took during the last struggle for the freedom of India.
('53', 457, 2, 8, 895692) The manifestation of energy, devotion and sacrifice which thousands of women made during the last satyagraha in India was nothing short of a miracle.
('53', 457, 2, 9, 895842) Though I had great faith in their ability to discharge their duty to the utmost, I was not prepared for the phenomenal awakening which occurred.
('53', 457, 2, 10, 895987) This probably took the country several years in advance.
('53', 457, 2, 11, 896044) If India today stands taller than she did eighteen months ago, I know Indian women had the largest share in it.
('53', 457, 2, 12, 896156) It does not surprise me that the vast body of women in India does not want to scramble for special protection and special privileges.
('53', 457, 2, 13, 896290) The women have set a noble example to men by abstaining form claiming special privileges.
('53', 457, 2, 14, 896380) I would like to have their blessings in order that I may not fail to represent the cause that has been entrusted to my hands.

('53', 457, 5, 17, 896584) It seems that some misunderstanding has arisen regarding the opinion I had expressed about Digamber Jain munis.
('53', 457, 5, 18, 896696) My article 2 was never intended to imply that any private individual could take the law into his own hands and harass Digambar munis or insult them.
('53', 457, 5, 19, 896845) I have heard that at present three such munis are staying at Mandvi.
('53', 457, 5, 20, 896914) During the monsoon they are not to go elsewhere.
('53', 457, 5, 21, 896963) There is a fairly large Jain population in Mandvi.
('53', 457, 5, 22, 897014) But I hear that other people there harass the munis on the basis of my article.
('53', 457, 5, 23, 897094) If this is true, it should be regarded as a misinterpretation of my article.

('53', 458, 4, 11, 897889) With reference to the revenue collections in Bardoli and Borsad, it was from the very beginning a clear understanding that the Khatedars affected by the Civil Disobedience were to pay only as much as they could without borrowing.
('53', 458, 4, 12, 898119) This was repeatedly brought out in the conversations between the Collector, Mr. Perry, of Kaira and his successor Mr. Bhadrapur and Mr. Kothawala, Collector of Surat.
('53', 458, 4, 13, 898286) The correspondence carried on with them confirms this statement.
('53', 458, 4, 14, 898351) So far as the terms of reference to the inquiry officer are concerned, I have distinctly understood that the standard referred to therein means ability to pay without borrowing.

('53', 459, 4, 5, 899008) The unofficial Minorities Conference began its sitting at 3 p.m.
('53', 459, 4, 6, 899073) and was still sitting at 5.45 p.m.
('53', 459, 4, 7, 899108) It is understood that in order to appreciate the full claims of the minority communities, representatives of each community outlined their position and questions discussed mainly concerned with the percentage of representation and weightage and reservation of seats.
('53', 459, 5, 8, 899375) During discussion great importance was laid on settlement of the HIndu Muslim question as the real crux of the minority problem.
('53', 459, 5, 9, 899504) The impression was created that if the Hindu Muslim question was settled, the claims of other minorities would be automatically adjusted.
('53', 459, 6, 10, 899642) The stand against communal representation and separate representation is reported to have been made by Mr. Gandhi towards the close of todays sitting of the unofficial committee after representatives of various minorities had presented their claims for separate representation and the quantum of representation.
('53', 459, 7, 11, 899954) Mr. Gandhi is reported to have given expression to the sense of unreality if all claims were taken at their face value and said that he felt cramped and hemmed in amid a plethora of claims Though he had not been idle, he was hitherto unable to see daylight but if he saw light he would act.
('53', 459, 8, 12, 900245) Mr. Gandhi is reported to have expressed the belief that he was able to help but to have invited the conference to elect another chairman if they thought otherwise, for he would not be ashamed to say that he had tried and failed.
('53', 459, 9, 13, 900475) Urging the need for a spirit of conciliation, Mr. Gandhi is reported to have invited the Conference to take more time if necessary, but declared that he was unable to compromise on fundamentals and, desirous as they were to see India a great nation, the Congress would never agree to communal representation and would be unworthy of its name if it allowed separate representation.

('53', 460, 4, 6, 901126) I was a born vegetarian, but I had lapsed from my vegetarianism owing to foolish companionship in youth.
('53', 460, 4, 7, 901231) On coming to London I became a convinced vegetarian, through having read Mr. Salts essay.

('53', 460, 8, 12, 901461) So far as human effort is concerned, I seem to be failing.
('53', 460, 8, 13, 901520) Burdens are being thrown upon me which I am ill able to bear.
('53', 460, 8, 14, 901582) It is a Herculean task, at the end of which there may be nothing more to be done and there may be no result.
('53', 460, 8, 15, 901691) But it does not matter.
('53', 460, 8, 16, 901715) No honest genuine effort has ever failed.
('53', 460, 8, 17, 901757) But if I am experiencing these chilly and chilling difficulties so far as my work is concerned, I am having nothing but perennial joy outside the Conference and the committees.
('53', 460, 8, 18, 901934) People seem instinctively to understand the thing.
('53', 460, 8, 19, 901985) Although I am an utter stranger, they wish me well and wish well to the cause.
('53', 460, 8, 20, 902064) The cause and I are one, they know,and so they greet me with smiles and blessings and this applies to people high and low.
('53', 460, 8, 21, 902187) And so I comfort myself that, so long as my cause is truthful and the means clean and non violent, all is well.

('53', 461, 2, 3, 902799) LONDON, October 8,1931
('53', 461, 3, 4, 902822) PRIME MINISTER AND FRIENDS, It is with deep sorrow and deeper humiliation that I have to anno unce utter failure on my part to secure an agreed solution of the commu nal question through informal conversations among and with the repres entatives of different groups.
('53', 461, 3, 5, 903089) I apologize to you, Mr. Prime Minister, and the other colleagues for the waste of a precious week.
('53', 461, 3, 6, 903188) My only conso lation lies in the fact that when I accepted the burden of carrying on these talks, I knew that there was not much hope of success, and still more in the fact that I am not aware of having spared any effort to reach a solution.
('53', 461, 3, 7, 903430) But to say that the conversations have to our utter shame failed is not to say the whole truth.
('53', 461, 3, 8, 903526) Causes of failure were inherent in the composition of the Indian Delegation.
('53', 461, 3, 9, 903603) We are almost all not elected representatives of the parties or groups whom we are presumed to represent; we are here by nomination of the Government.
('53', 461, 3, 10, 903754) Nor are those whose presence was absolutely necessary for an agreed solution to be found here.
('53', 461, 3, 11, 903849) Further, you will allow me to say that this was hardly the time to summon the Minorities Committee.
('53', 461, 3, 12, 903949) It lacks the sense of reality in what we do not know what it is that we are going to get.
('53', 461, 3, 13, 904039) If we knew in a definite manner that we were going to get the thing we want, we should hesitate fifty times before we throw it away in a sinful wrangle, as it would be if we are told that the getting of it would depend on the ability of the present Delegation to produce an agreed solution of the communal tangle.
('53', 461, 3, 14, 904353) The solution can be the crown of the swaraj constitution, not its foundation, if only because our differences have hardened, if they have hardened, if they have not arisen, by reason of the foreign domination.
('53', 461, 3, 15, 904563) I have not a shodow of a doubt that the iceberg of communal differences will melt under the warmth of the sun of freedom.
('53', 461, 3, 16, 904685) I, thereore, venture to suggest that the Minorities Committee be adjourned sine die and that the fundamentals of the constitution be hammered into shape as quickly as may be.
('53', 461, 3, 17, 904860) Meanwhile, the informal work of discovering a true solution of the communal problem will and must continue; only it must not baulk or be allowed to block the
('53', 462, 0, 1, 905018) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 463
('53', 462, 1, 2, 905062) progress of constitution building.
('53', 462, 1, 3, 905097) Attention must be diverted from it and concentrated on the main part of the structure.
('53', 462, 1, 4, 905184) I hardly need point out to the Committee that my failure does not mean the end of all hope of arriving at an agreed solution.
('53', 462, 1, 5, 905310) My failure does not even mean my utter defeat; there is no such word in my dictionary.
('53', 462, 1, 6, 905397) My confession merely means failure of the special effort for which I presumed to ask for a weeks indulgence, which you so generously give.
('53', 462, 1, 7, 905536) I propose to use the failure as a stepping stone to success, and I invite you all to do likewise; but, should all effort at agreement fail, even when the Round Table Conference reaches the end of its labours, I would suggest the addition of a clause to the expected constitution appointing a judicial tribunal that would examine all claims and give its final decision on all the points that may be left unsettled.
('53', 462, 1, 8, 905950) Nor need this Committee think that the time given for enabling informal conversations to be carried on has been altogether wasted.
('53', 462, 1, 9, 906081) You will be glad to learn that many friends not members of the Delegation have been giving their attention to the question.
('53', 462, 1, 10, 906205) Among these I would mention Sir Geoffrey Corbett.
('53', 462, 1, 11, 906255) He has produced a scheme of redistribution of the Punjab which, though it has not found acceptance, is, in my opinion, well worth studying.
('53', 462, 1, 12, 906395) I am asking Sir Geoffrey if he will kindly eleborate and circulate it among the members.
('53', 462, 1, 13, 906484) Our Sikh colleagues have also produced another, which is at least worthy of study.
('53', 462, 1, 14, 906567) Sir Hubert Carr produced last night an ingenious and noval proposal to set up for the Punjab two Legislatures, the lower to satisfy the Muslim claim and the upper nearly satisfying the Sikh claim.
('53', 462, 1, 15, 906764) Though I am no believer in a bicameral Legislature, I am much attracted by Sir Huberts proposal, and I would invite him to pursue it further with the same zeal with which, I gratefully admit, he followed and contributed to the informal deliberations.
('53', 462, 1, 16, 907015) Lastly, inasmuch, as the only reason or my appearance at these deliberations is that I represent the Indian National Congress, I must clearly set forth its position.
('53', 462, 1, 17, 907181) In site of appearances to the contrary, especially in England, the Congress claims to represent the whole nation, and most decidedly the dumb millions, among whom are included the numberless untouchables, who are more suppressed than depressed, as also in a way the more unfortunate and neglected classes known as Backward Races.
('53', 463, 0, 1, 907511) 464 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 463, 1, 2, 907553) Here is the Congress position in a nutshell.
('53', 463, 1, 3, 907598) I am reading the Congress resolution on the subject.
('53', 463, 2, 4, 907651) However much it may have failed in the realization, the Congress has, since its inception, set up pure nationalism as its ideal.
('53', 463, 2, 5, 907780) It has endeavoured to break down communal barriers.
('53', 463, 2, 6, 907832) The following Lahore resolution was the culminating point in its advance towards nationalism :
('53', 463, 3, 7, 907927) In view of the lapse of the Nehru Report it is necessary to declare the policy of the Congress regarding communal questions :
('53', 463, 4, 8, 908053) The Congress believes that in an independent India communal questions can only be solved on strictly national lines; but as the Sikhs in particular, and the Muslims and the other minorities in general, have expressed dissatisfaction over the solution of communal questions, proposed in the Nehru Report, this congress assures the Sikhs, the Muslims and other minorities that no solution thereof in any future constitution will be acceptable to the Congress that does not give full satisfaction to the parties concerned.
('53', 463, 5, 9, 908573) Hence the Congress is precluded from setting forth any communal solution of the communal problem, but at this critical juncture in the history of the nation it was felt that the Working Committee should suggest for adoption by the country a solution, though communal in appearance, yet as nearly national as possible, and generally acceptable to the communities concerned.
('53', 463, 5, 10, 908946) The Working Committee, therefore, after full and free discussion, unanimously passed the following scheme :
('53', 463, 6, 11, 909054) 1. (a) The article in the constitution relating to fundamental rights shall include a guarantee to the communities concerned of the protection of their cultures, languages, scritps, education, profession and practice of religion and religious endowments;
('53', 463, 7, 12, 909309) (b) Personal laws shall be protected by specific provisions to be embodied in the constitution;
('53', 463, 8, 13, 909405) (c) Protection of political and other rights of minority communities in the various Provinces shall be the concern and be within the jurisdiction of the Federal Government.
('53', 463, 9, 14, 909578) 2. The Franchise shall be extended to all adult men and women
('53', 463, 10, 15, 909640) And then there is a note to this:
('53', 463, 11, 16, 909674) The Working Committee is committed to adult franchise by the Karachi resolution of the Congress, and cannot entertain any alternative franchise.
('53', 463, 11, 17, 909819) In view, however, of misapprehensions in some quarters, the Committee wishes to make it clear that, in any event, the franchise shall be uniform and so
('53', 464, 0, 1, 909971) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 465
('53', 464, 1, 2, 910015) extensive as to reflect in the electoral roll the proportion in the population of every community.
('53', 464, 2, 3, 910114) 3. (a) Joint electorates shall form the basis of representation in the future constitution of India; (b) That for the Hindus in Sind, the Muslims in Assam and the Sikhs in the Punjab and North West Frontier Province, and for Hindus and Muslims in any province where they are less than 25 per cent of the population, seats shall be reserved in the Federal and Provincial Legislatures on the basis of population, with the right to contest additional seats.
('53', 464, 3, 4, 910569) 4. The appointments shall be made by non party Public Service Commissions, which shall prescribe the minimum qualifications, and which shall have due regard to the efficiency of the Public Service as well as to the principle of equal opportunity to all communities for a fair share in the Public Services of the country.
('53', 464, 4, 5, 910890) 5. In the formation of Federal and Provincial Cabinets, the interests of minority communities shall be recognized by convention.
('53', 464, 5, 6, 911019) 6. The North West Frontier Province and Baluchistan shall have the same form of government and administration as other Provinces.
('53', 464, 6, 7, 911149) 7. Sind shall be constituted into a separate Province provided that the people of sind are prepared to bear the financial burden of the separated Provinces.
('53', 464, 7, 8, 911306) 8. The future constitution of the country shall be Federal.
('53', 464, 7, 9, 911366) The residuary powers shall vest in the federating units unless, on further examination, it is found to be against the best interest of India.
('53', 464, 8, 10, 911508) The Working Committee has adopted the foregoing scheme as a compromise between the proposals based on undiluted communalism and undiluted nationalism.
('53', 464, 8, 11, 911659) Whilst on the one hand the Working Committee hopes that the whole nation will endorse the scheme, on the other it assures those who take extreme views and cannot adopt it, that the Committee will gladly, as it is bound to by the Lahore Resolution, accept without reservation any other scheme if it commands the acceptance of all the parties concerned.
('53', 464, 9, 12, 912011) That is the Congress resolution.
('53', 464, 9, 13, 912044) If, however, a national solution is impossible and the Congress scheme proves unacceptable, I am not precluded from endorsing any other reasonable scheme which may be acceptable to the parties concerned.
('53', 464, 9, 14, 912248) The Congress position on this question, therefore, is one of the greatest possible accommodation.

('53', 465, 1, 2, 912433) Where it cannot help, it will not obstruct.
('53', 465, 1, 3, 912477) Needless to say, the Congress will whole heartedly support any scheme of private arbitration.
('53', 465, 1, 4, 912571) It seems to have been represented that I am opposed to any representation of the untouchables on the Legislature.
('53', 465, 1, 5, 912685) This is a travesty of the truth.
('53', 465, 1, 6, 912718) What I have said, and what I must repeat, is that I am opposed to their special representation.
('53', 465, 1, 7, 912814) I am convinced that it can do them no good, and may do much harm; but the Congress is wedded to adult franchise.
('53', 465, 1, 8, 912927) Therefore, millions of them can be placed on the Voters Roll.
('53', 465, 1, 9, 912989) It is impossible to conceive that, with untouchability fast disappearing, nominees of these voters can be boycotted by the others; but what these people need more than election to be Legislatures is protection from social and religious persecution.
('53', 465, 1, 10, 913238) Custom, which is often more powerful than law, has brought them to a degradation of which every thinking HIndu has need to feel ashamed and to do penance.
('53', 465, 1, 11, 913393) I should, therefore, have the most drastic legislation rendering criminal all the special persecution to which these fellow countrymen of mine are subjected by the socalled superior classes.
('53', 465, 1, 12, 913584) Thank God, the conscience of Hindus has been stirred, and untouchability will soon be a relic of our sinful past.

('53', 466, 1, 2, 914234) 508. SPEECH AT CONFERENCE OF MISSIONARY SOCIETIES IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND 1
('53', 466, 2, 3, 914315) LONDON, October 8, 1931
('53', 466, 3, 4, 914339) The meeting was begun with a brief period of silence and the Rev.
('53', 466, 3, 5, 914405) W. Paton, who presided, welcomed Mr. Gandhi and expressed the appreciation of the missionary societies of the fact that Mr. Gandhi could spare time to meet them in the midst of tremendous pressure of work.
('53', 466, 4, 6, 914611) Mr. Gandhi, after expressing pleasure at being present and at meeting those who represented a much larger audience, said: I am appearing before you like a prisoner at the bar, but my jailors are friends.
('53', 466, 4, 7, 914815) There must be no barrier between us, no harbouring of any grievance on either side.
('53', 466, 4, 8, 914899) From youth upwards I have enjoyed the friendliest relations with missionaries throughout the world, and in South Africa I came into close touch with some of the finest of Christian missionaries.
('53', 466, 4, 9, 915094) I attended your churches most regularly and also private prayer meetings and the views I express now are the views I expressed then.
('53', 466, 4, 10, 915227) A temporary misunderstanding had arisen between you and me.
('53', 466, 4, 11, 915287) When newspaper men pry into the affairs of those leading public lives the latter get misrepresented, sometimes maliciously and at other times unintentionally.
('53', 466, 4, 12, 915446) Responsible men should learn from my very bitter experience not to believe generally what the reporters state.
('53', 466, 4, 13, 915557) The recent report about my attitude to missions was an unconscious misrepresentation, for I got to know the source and the reporter in question.
('53', 466, 4, 14, 915702) I was tired out at the time and was having exercise early in the morning.
('53', 466, 4, 15, 915776) The reporter walked with me and bombarded me with questions.
('53', 466, 4, 16, 915837) He did not take any notes and we spoke on a variety of topics.
('53', 466, 4, 17, 915900) When I saw the criticisms and innuendoes, I realized at once that I had to suffer in consequence of what the reporter wrote, even though he was friendly.
('53', 466, 4, 18, 916054) I speak as a public worker and as an amateur journalist of thirty
('53', 466, 5, 19, 916120) 1 The conference was hald at Church Missionary House, 6 Salisbury Square.
('53', 466, 5, 20, 916194) The Rev.
('53', 466, 5, 21, 916203) W. Paton presided.
('53', 466, 5, 22, 916222) The meeting was private and the only report issued to the Press was to the effect that a friendly discussion had taken place.
('53', 467, 0, 1, 916348) 468 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 467, 1, 2, 916390) years standing.
('53', 467, 1, 3, 916406) I know the difficulty of telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth and the great difficulty of doing justice to your opponents and the greater difficulty of handling facts.
('53', 467, 1, 4, 916598) Do not believe generally what the reporters say about me.
('53', 467, 1, 5, 916656) If you have doubt about their statements, send them to me and ask about them.
('53', 467, 1, 6, 916734) I have had letters from all parts of India and from England and the U.S.A. asking me if it was true that I would prohibit all missionary enterprise and especially proselytizing.
('53', 467, 1, 7, 916912) What I meant was just the contrary.
('53', 467, 1, 8, 916948) I cannot stand for any kind of compulsion.
('53', 467, 1, 9, 916991) Any suggestion that I should want legislation to prohibit missionary enterprise or to interfere with the beliefs of other people is unthinkable.
('53', 467, 1, 10, 917136) The idea of converting people to ones faith by speech and writings, by appeal to reason and emotion and by suggesting that the faith of his forefathers is a bad faith, in my opinion, limits the possibilities of serving humanity.
('53', 467, 1, 11, 917365) I believe that the great religions of the world are all more or less true and that they have descended to us from God.
('53', 467, 1, 12, 917484) Having come to us, however, through human media, they have become adulterated.
('53', 467, 1, 13, 917563) Holding this belief, I hold also that no religion is absolutely perfect.
('53', 467, 1, 14, 917636) In the bosom of God there is nothing imperfect, but immediately it comes through a human medium, it constantly suffers change and deterioration.
('53', 467, 1, 15, 917781) The seeker after truth most humbly recognizes this possibility.
('53', 467, 1, 16, 917845) I have found that the progress of truth is impeded by the spoken word which is the limitation of thought, for no man has been able to give the fullest expression in words to thought.
('53', 467, 1, 17, 918028) The very nature of thought is limitless and boundless.
('53', 467, 1, 18, 918083) A man of prayer believes that God works in a mysterious way and wants the whole world to possess the truth he himself has seen.
('53', 467, 1, 19, 918211) He would simply pray for it to be shared.
('53', 467, 1, 20, 918253) It passes; it takes wing.
('53', 467, 1, 21, 918279) Shall I use a simile of which I am never tired and which you will forgive.
('53', 467, 1, 22, 918354) Religion is like a rose.
('53', 467, 1, 23, 918379) It throws out the scent which attracts us like a magnet and we are drawn to it involuntarily.
('53', 467, 1, 24, 918473) The scent of religious contact has a greater pungency that the scent of the rose, that is why I hold my view with reference to conversion.
('53', 467, 1, 25, 918612) It is good and proper that, when we feel satisfied that we have found God and that God has spoken to us, we should wish to share that mystery, but as God has spoken to us mysteriously, we should allow that God Mystery to flow from us in exactly the same manner.
('53', 468, 0, 1, 918874) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 469
('53', 468, 1, 2, 918918) Whilst I criticize this part of missionary work, I willingly admit that missions have done indirect good to India.
('53', 468, 1, 3, 919033) There is no doubt about this.
('53', 468, 1, 4, 919063) But for my having come under Christian influence, some of my social work would not have been done.
('53', 468, 1, 5, 919162) My fierce hatred of child marriageI gladly say is due to Christian influence.
('53', 468, 1, 6, 919240) I have come into contact with many splendid specimens of Christian missionaries.
('53', 468, 1, 7, 919321) In spite of differences I could not possibly help being affected by their merit.
('53', 468, 1, 8, 919402) And so you will find growing up in my Ashram unmarried girls, though they are free to marry if they wish.
('53', 468, 1, 9, 919508) I am speaking not of university women but of girls who belong to the uneducated class.
('53', 468, 1, 10, 919595) Before I knew anything of Christianity I was an enemy of untou chability.
('53', 468, 1, 11, 919669) I could not understand my mother, whom I adored, withdrawing the hem of her garment from the untouchables.
('53', 468, 1, 12, 919776) My feelings gained mo mentum owing to the fierce attack from Christian sources on this evil.
('53', 468, 1, 13, 919869) If I want a pattern of the ideal missionary, I should instance C. F. Andrews.
('53', 468, 1, 14, 919947) If he were here, he would blush for what I want to say.
('53', 468, 1, 15, 920003) I believe that he is today truer, broader and better for his toleration of the other principal religions of the world.
('53', 468, 1, 16, 920122) He never speaks with me about conversion to Christianity though we are closest friends.
('53', 468, 1, 17, 920210) I have many friends, but the friendship between Charlie Andrews and myself is especially deep.
('53', 468, 1, 18, 920305) It was love at first sight when I saw him first at Durban.
('53', 468, 1, 19, 920364) If you asked me whether I have noticed any laxity or indifference about his own fundamental position, I would say that he has become firmer in his own faith and in the growth of love for others.
('53', 468, 1, 20, 920559) I think, whereas he used to see blemishes in Hinduism , today perhaps he sees those very blemishes in another setting, and therefore becomes more approachable to the Hindu.
('53', 468, 1, 21, 920732) He is today a potent instrument in influencing the lives of Hindus for the better in hundreds and thousands of cases.
('53', 468, 1, 22, 920850) His Indian friends in South Africa wrote to me that he was Deenabandhubrother of those in distress.
('53', 468, 1, 23, 920950) He has endeared himself even to the scavenger class, the pariahs.
('53', 468, 1, 24, 921016) He went to them natu rally and influenced their conduct in the simplest manner, and now he is help in very great affection.
('53', 468, 1, 25, 921140) If I were to compete with him as to which of us had the greatest influence with these people in South Africa, I am not sure that he would not floor me.
('53', 469, 0, 1, 921292) 470 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 469, 1, 2, 921334) I want to put all my cards on the table and I want you to do so too.
('53', 469, 1, 3, 921403) I hope you will be able to say, We listened to the old man that evening and we heard nothing that was not truthful and sincere.
('53', 469, 2, 4, 921531) After Mr.Gandhi had finished, and before questions were asked Mr.Paton read the resolution passed in 1924 by the Delhi Unity Conference on the subject of Religious Freedom : 1
('53', 469, 3, 5, 921707) This Conference is emphatically of opinion that the utmost freedom of conscience and religion is essential, and condemns any desecration of places of worship to whatsoever faith they may belong, and any persecution or punishment or any person or adopting or reverting to any faith, and further condemns any attempt by compulsion to convert people to ones faith or to enforce oness own religious observance at the cost of the rights of others.
('53', 469, 4, 6, 922150) With a view to give effect to the general principles promoting better relations between the various communities of India laid down in the above resolution and the secure full toleration of all faiths, beliefs and religious practices, this Conference records its opinion :
('53', 469, 5, 7, 922422) That every individual or group shall have full liberty to hold and give expression to his or their beliefs and follow any religious practice, with due regard to the feelings of others and without interfering with their rights.
('53', 469, 5, 8, 922649) In no case may such individual or group revile the founders, holy persons or tenets of any other faith.
('53', 469, 6, 9, 922753) That every individual is at liberty to follow any faith and to change it whenever he so wills, and shall not by reason of such change of faith render himself liable to any puhishment or persecution at the hands of the followers of the faith renounced by him.
('53', 469, 7, 10, 923012) That every individual or group is at liberty to convert or reconvert
('53', 469, 8, 11, 923081) another by argument or persuasion but must not attempt to do so, or prevent it
('53', 469, 9, 12, 923160) being done, by force, fraud or other unfair means, such as the offering of
('53', 469, 10, 13, 923235) material inducement.
('53', 469, 10, 14, 923256) Persons under 16 years of age should not be converted
('53', 469, 11, 15, 923310) unless it be along with their parents or guardians.
('53', 469, 11, 16, 923362) If any person under 16 years
('53', 469, 12, 17, 923391) of age is found stranded without his parent or guardian by a person of another
('53', 469, 13, 18, 923470) faith, he should be promptly handed over to a person of his own faith.
('53', 469, 14, 19, 923541) must be no secrecy about any conversion or reconversion.
('53', 469, 15, 20, 923598) Mr. Paton mentioned that Mr. Gandhi, though engaged in his fast at the time, had himself taken a large part in drafting these resolutions.
('53', 469, 15, 21, 923737) He said that he hoped
('53', 469, 16, 22, 923759) 1 This was about the time of Gandhijis fast for communal unity in Delhi in September 1924.

('53', 470, 1, 2, 923894) these resolutions still represented Mr. Gandhis views.
('53', 470, 2, 3, 923949) To this question Mr. Gandhi gave definite assent.
('53', 470, 3, 4, 923999) The Rev.
('53', 470, 3, 5, 924008) Godfrey Phillips of the London Missionary Society said :
('53', 470, 4, 6, 924065) I wish we could understand one another better with regard to what is happening amongst the untouchables in connection with Christian missions.
('53', 470, 4, 7, 924208) There are places in the world where there is no scent of the rose.
('53', 470, 4, 8, 924275) We have found in our experience that when the real untouchable, the outcaste, is down and out, we can do nothing permanent except by implanting in his inmost heart something that has vitalizing powerin our experience that is fellowship with God in Christ.
('53', 470, 4, 9, 924531) We can only get at them in a community.
('53', 470, 4, 10, 924571) We are with the Mahatma in his feeling for the hungry masses.
('53', 470, 4, 11, 924633) We are with him in his desire to remove untouchability, but we feel also that we must put inside the outcaste something that will work inside him for always.
('53', 470, 4, 12, 924791) Can we not understand each other better ?
('53', 470, 4, 13, 924833) Sometimes when we try to get land for our work, it is the Mahatmas followers who prevent us.
('53', 470, 4, 14, 924926) Even if the Mahatma does not wish us to convert, our belief in conversion is due to the fact that we really can see no other way.
('53', 470, 5, 15, 925056) MR. GANDHI : I honour Mr.Phillips for his question.
('53', 470, 5, 16, 925108) I dont want to prevent by legislation or force the work of converting, but I wish I could convince Mr. Phillips and other missionaries that in my own humble opinion it is an erroneous way.
('53', 470, 5, 17, 925297) He has used my analogy of the rose.
('53', 470, 5, 18, 925333) He says that the missionaries have to take as it were a rose to the untouchables.
('53', 470, 5, 19, 925415) I would call him a walking rose, and he does not need to be anything more.
('53', 470, 5, 20, 925490) He does not need to talk about God because these men would be able to see God somewhere written in him and in his conduct, just as, if the rose were planted in front of the pariahs house, it would silently spread its scent.
('53', 470, 5, 21, 925714) The rose would not have to speak, neither would the Christian missionary have to speak.
('53', 470, 5, 22, 925802) If Mr.Phillips thinks that before he can come to the help of the untouchables, he must bring the message of God, or the message of the Bible to the untou chables, how much more then to a man like me.
('53', 470, 5, 23, 926002) I press this point after having mixed with tens of thousands of untouchables, and done much work of this kind.
('53', 470, 5, 24, 926113) They do not understand his language.
('53', 470, 5, 25, 926150) They understand me better because I speak their language.
('53', 470, 5, 26, 926208) I speak to them about their degraded condition.
('53', 470, 5, 27, 926256) I do not speak about God.
('53', 470, 5, 28, 926282) I feel that I take the message of God to them in this particular manner just as to a starving man I take the message of God through the bread I give him.
('53', 470, 5, 29, 926436) I have no axe to grind.
('53', 470, 5, 30, 926460) I must not exploit him, I just give him the bread.
('53', 470, 5, 31, 926511) If I want to convey God to the untouchable I must take Him in the way that he needs.
('53', 470, 5, 32, 926596) I go to the
('53', 471, 0, 1, 926608) 472 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 471, 1, 2, 926650) untouchables and say, What God can I give you unless it is what you need.
('53', 471, 2, 3, 926724) Mr. Gandhi went on to give an illustration of the pitiable state of an old man of the untouchable class, who was not even allowed within sight.
('53', 471, 2, 4, 926868) Said Mr. Gandhi : He was brought to me to present an address.
('53', 471, 2, 5, 926930) The man was afraid of everything, like a countryman set down in the middle of London traffic.
('53', 471, 3, 6, 927024) He dropped the address he was to give, but, said Mr. Gandhi: I picked it up and showed him the right way to hold it.
('53', 471, 3, 7, 927141) By my attitude I succeeded in gaining his confidence, and I felt that by doing so I had given him a message from God.
('53', 471, 3, 8, 927259) If I were a Christian missionary (and I can enter into the hearts of Christian missionaries), I would go into their midst as Elwin 1 has gone.
('53', 471, 3, 9, 927402) He is today planning to work among the untouchables, will establish Christian ashrams among the untouchables, with a church in a mud hut for his own and his colleagues use.
('53', 471, 3, 10, 927575) He wants simply to live among them as God may guide his life.
('53', 471, 4, 11, 927637) The Rev.
('53', 471, 4, 12, 927646) C.E.Wilson of the Baptist Missionary Society said :
('53', 471, 5, 13, 927698) To me the religious life may be simply described as a life of discipleship.
('53', 471, 5, 14, 927774) We are all learners.
('53', 471, 5, 15, 927795) The true missionary claims to be a disciple, with a trust to carry out the commission of his Lord, and to persuade others to be disciples.
('53', 471, 5, 16, 927934) Mr. Gandhi seems to me to deprecate, almost to condemn, religious teaching.
('53', 471, 5, 17, 928010) We are to go and live among people but not try to make them disciples or instil new faith into them.
('53', 471, 5, 18, 928111) That seems to me confute Mr. Gandhis whole life.
('53', 471, 5, 19, 928160) Does Mr. Gandhi mean that it is not right for us to go to India or any place and try to make poeple disciples, to teach the supreme truth of Jesus Christ if we believe him to be the highest that we know ?
('53', 471, 5, 20, 928365) Mr. Gandhi has been preaching to us today.
('53', 471, 5, 21, 928408) Does he really mean to exclude all preaching ?
('53', 471, 6, 22, 928455) MR GANDHI : Language fails to convey meaning; the uttered word is the limitation of thought.
('53', 471, 6, 23, 928548) There is room for both writing and speech, though I find it would often be better if I wrote and spoke less, but I do not seek to convert anybody to my faith.
('53', 471, 6, 24, 928707) Though my conviction is strong enough in me for me to die for that conviction, that force does not carry me to the goal of believing that the same thing should be believed by my fellow men.

('53', 472, 1, 2, 928980) for me, but I am not so presumptuous as to believe that I know what God wishes for others.
('53', 472, 1, 3, 929071) Religious truth comes to us mysteriously.
('53', 472, 1, 4, 929113) How did sudden upheaval come to Paul and others ?
('53', 472, 1, 5, 929163) Religion is a matter that must be left to God.
('53', 472, 1, 6, 929210) I do not say no religious teaching; bring up a man to the highest light his own faith has to give him.
('53', 472, 1, 7, 929313) I know how impertinent it is for an utter stranger to speak to those to whom the message of the Bible is sacred as life itself.
('53', 472, 1, 8, 929441) I am speaking to you as a seeker after God, just as you also are seekers after God.
('53', 472, 1, 9, 929525) Once some of my friends thought that if I talked with Mr. F. B. Meyer it would make for my conversion.
('53', 472, 1, 10, 929628) They thought that I was incomplete without acknowledging the message of Christ, and so they put me in touch with Mr. Meyer.
('53', 472, 1, 11, 929752) He asked me: Have you found peace? When I said Yes, he said: I have nothing to say to you. Religion is a personal matter, and I am not going to ask another man to become a Hindu or a Parsi.
('53', 472, 1, 12, 929942) I would be doing something contrary to my belief.
('53', 472, 1, 13, 929992) I am sharing with you my own experience, and trying to show you as fellow workers that probably, if you could see eye to eye with me, your work would flourish more and more.
('53', 472, 1, 14, 930166) You have amazing self sacrifice; you are great organizers; you are good men.
('53', 472, 1, 15, 930243) I want to multiply occasions for your service.
('53', 472, 1, 16, 930290) I want to work closer with you, but I do not want you to get India to change her faith.
('53', 472, 2, 17, 930378) The Rev.
('53', 472, 2, 18, 930387) W. H. G. Holmes of the Oxford Mission of Calcutta:
('53', 472, 3, 19, 930438) I was in the south of India walking with some Indian students across a path which lay through a field.
('53', 472, 3, 20, 930541) As we approached a group of Indians, they suddenly withdrew to a distance of about 40 yards into the middle of the field.
('53', 472, 3, 21, 930663) I went up to these Indians and asked why they had done this.
('53', 472, 3, 22, 930724) They did this because they feared we were Brahmins, and therefore they must remove themselves.
('53', 472, 3, 23, 930819) I then said they need not have done that for us because we were Christians, and regarded them as our brothers, and there was a Father in Heaven to whom they were just as dear as we were.
('53', 472, 3, 24, 931006) They answered me: "These are good words, will you please come to our village and open a school there. Would we be right in going to teach them about this Father, who I told them loved them as dearly as he loved us, and would Mr. Gandhi encourage them to let us have land to build on in order to teach these people?
('53', 472, 4, 25, 931321) MR. GANDHI : Yes, I would , on one condition, that you will teach them the religion of their fathers through the religion they have got.
('53', 472, 4, 26, 931458) Dont say to them: The only way to know the Father is our way.

('53', 473, 1, 2, 931600) God is Father to the untouchable, to all of us, but a Father who appears to you in another garb.
('53', 473, 1, 3, 931697) Show the untouchable, the Father as he appears in his surroundings.
('53', 473, 1, 4, 931765) Unless you are satisfied that we do not know the real Father at all, and then of course it is your duty to say What you know as Father is no Father at all.
('53', 473, 1, 5, 931921) What you believe comes from Satan. I somtimes receive letters saying that I am a good man, but that I am doing the devils work.
('53', 473, 1, 6, 932049) I feel I adore the same Father though in a different form.
('53', 473, 1, 7, 932108) I may not adore him as God .
('53', 473, 1, 8, 932137) To me that name makes no appeal, but when I think of Him as Rama, He thrills me.
('53', 473, 1, 9, 932218) To think of God as God does not fire me as the name Rama does.
('53', 473, 1, 10, 932281) There is all the poetry in it.
('53', 473, 1, 11, 932312) I know that my forefathers have known him as Rama.
('53', 473, 1, 12, 932363) They have been uplifted for Rama, and when I take the name of Rama, I arise with the same energy.
('53', 473, 1, 13, 932461) It would not be possible for me to use the name God as it is written in the Bible.
('53', 473, 1, 14, 932544) It is so contrary to experience.
('53', 473, 1, 15, 932577) I should not be attracted.
('53', 473, 1, 16, 932604) I should not be lifted to the truth.
('53', 473, 1, 17, 932641) Therefore my whole soul rejects the teaching that Rama is not my God.
('53', 473, 1, 18, 932711) Go to the untouchables; give them schools; give them all, but not with your idea in the back of your mind.
('53', 473, 1, 19, 932818) If anyone were able to show me that God the Father had to be approached in one particular way, I would not hesitate a moment.
('53', 473, 1, 20, 932944) I would go to the whole world, but my life would have to be rewritten.
('53', 473, 1, 21, 933015) I have no disciples except myself and he is a terrible one.
('53', 473, 1, 22, 933075) I have followers, but I do not feel that they are disciples.
('53', 473, 1, 23, 933136) My search is for peace, and to show God through the life I live.
('53', 473, 1, 24, 933201) I give myself to my fellow men.
('53', 473, 1, 25, 933233) This is the secret of peace and happiness also.
('53', 473, 2, 26, 933281) A member of the conference asked two questions.
('53', 473, 2, 27, 933329) First, whether Mr. Gandhi
('53', 473, 3, 28, 933355) had said in an interview with Dr. Mott in India that the effect of Christian missions
('53', 473, 4, 29, 933441) had been wholly bad.
('53', 473, 4, 30, 933462) 1 Mr. Gandhi indicated that the quotation was entirely strange to
('53', 473, 5, 31, 933528) him, and again repeated that he had been the victim of false reporting.
('53', 473, 5, 32, 933600) The questioner
('53', 473, 6, 33, 933615) further referred to the command to Christians to go out to all the world and preach the
('53', 473, 7, 34, 933703) Gospel to every creature.
('53', 473, 7, 35, 933729) Mr. Gandhis reply to this was that, if the questioner
('53', 473, 8, 36, 933783) believed that these were the inspired words in the Bible, then he was called upon to
('53', 473, 9, 37, 933868) obey implicitlywhy did he ask a non Christian for his interpretation?
('53', 473, 10, 38, 933938) Mr. Paton thanked Mr. Gandhi warmly on behalf of all those present for the frankness and cordiality with which he had spoken.
('53', 473, 10, 39, 934064) He said that Mr. Gandhi had made it abundantly plain that the issue between himself and the Christian missionary

('53', 474, 1, 2, 934265) movement lay much deeper than was sometimes supposed.
('53', 474, 1, 3, 934319) Mr. Gandhi was not desirous only that missionaries should be couteous and self effacing, and should identify themselves with the people of the country, but was opposed to something which was fundamental in Christianity.
('53', 474, 1, 4, 934539) Mr. Paton asked that Mr. Gandhi would believe that missionaries, and those who supported them, were sincere in saying that the content of their message was not themselves, or the fancied superiority of their country and civilization, but was the Person and Message of Jesus Christ.
('53', 474, 1, 5, 934821) The spirit of missions could only be that of witness to what men and women most deeply believe to be true and therefore must share with others.

('53', 474, 9, 18, 935691) I know that feeling for me over there in your part of the world is deeper than here.

('53', 475, 3, 4, 936199) He discussed the question of the education of the child, listened with rapt attention as Gandhiji gave him the rich experience of a lifetime of the value of self restraint and the great part it plays as much in the life of the child as of the adult.
('53', 475, 3, 5, 936449) What is the cause of the present chaos? he asked.
('53', 475, 3, 6, 936499) Gandhiji said: It is exploitation, I will not say of the weaker nations by the stronger, but of sister nations by sister nations.
('53', 475, 3, 7, 936629) And my fundamental objection to machinery rests on the fact that is machinery that has enabled these nations to exploit others.
('53', 475, 3, 8, 936757) In itself it is a wooden thing and can be turned to good purpose or bad.
('53', 475, 3, 9, 936830) But it is easily turned to a bad purpose as we know.
('53', 475, 4, 10, 936883) Dont you think, said Mr. Desmond, all these people here are overfed?
('53', 475, 4, 11, 936952) How can we teach them to feed less? Gandhiji said: The force of circumstances.
('53', 475, 4, 12, 937031) They are bound to realize one of these days that England is not going to return to her old prospertiy.
('53', 475, 4, 13, 937134) They must realize that many nations bid fair to divide the spoils with them and, as soon as they do so, they will cut the coat according to their cloth.
('53', 475, 5, 14, 937287) The crisis therefore, said Mr. Desmond, with great emphasis, is a great thing, I have no doubt.

('53', 477, 6, 9, 939375) DEAR SATYAMURTHI, I have your letter giving me your views about the scope of our demandsabout Indian States Subjects, Defence, External Affairs and Finance.
('53', 477, 6, 10, 939532) I do not know when the subjects will be reached, but of course I shall bear in mind all you say on the four heads.
('53', 477, 7, 11, 939647) Yours sincerely, S. SATYAMURTHI, ESQ.

('53', 478, 1, 2, 940006) 515. SPEECH AT FEDERAL STRUCTURE
('53', 478, 2, 3, 940039) COMMITTEE MEETING
('53', 478, 3, 4, 940057) LONDON, October 9, 1931 Well, Lord Chancellor, I know that I have been somewhat instrumental in postponing the deliberations of this Committee; and, being in that unfortunate position, I now feel some diffidence when I say that we cannot afford to waste a single minute.
('53', 478, 3, 5, 940328) 1 We have come, as you very properly say, all these several thousand miles in order to work, and not in order to seek recreation or holiday; so I would certainly say that, if it is at all possible, we should go through the work of the Federal Structure Committee without waiting for a single minute.
('53', 478, 3, 6, 940628) If at the back of our minds, individually or collectively, the thought is lurking that, even though we might be sitting over the deliberations of the Federal Structure Committee, we would be really marking time until the minorities question is settled if that really is the feeling which we would not or we dare not express then I would suggest that we express that feeling and come to a decision.
('53', 478, 3, 7, 941026) I myself endeavoured to express my own deliberate opinion yesterday that there is not that absolutely vital connection with the work of this Committee.
('53', 478, 3, 8, 941178) The minorities question is undoubtedly a very important, if not the most important, question.
('53', 478, 3, 9, 941272) It has always occupied in my own mind its natural place, but it has never overshadowed the other equally important consideration.
('53', 478, 3, 10, 941402) And, after having laboured at this question for seven days, I saw more clearly than I had seen before that probably the minorities question would not be satisfactorily settled unless the great fundamental questions were settled.
('53', 478, 3, 11, 941631) That being my conviction, I should like the proceedings of this Committee to be clothed with reality, and that, on several heads which you, with your amazing industry, have been piling upon us from day to day and week to week, we should come to summary decisions instead of making speeches.
('53', 478, 3, 12, 941922) Therefore, if I may give my opinion without any mental reservation whatsoever, I would suggest
('53', 478, 4, 13, 942017) 1 The chairman had suggested adjournment of the meeting till Tuesday, October 13.
('53', 479, 0, 1, 942099) 480 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 479, 1, 2, 942141) that, if we really feel, as I feel, that we should consider and face the questions that are before this Committee on their merits, irrespective of what may happen in connection with the minorities question, then I say that we should sacrifice every holiday; and I know that we shall get the strength to go through this work without coming to grief if we mean serious business.
('53', 479, 1, 3, 942518) But I repeat, as I conclude, that if at the back of our minds the impression is that we should continue to work and yet not work, I think that it would not be just to India, it would not be just to ourselves, and it would not be just to the British Ministers either.
('53', 479, 1, 4, 942785) Thereore, I feel most strongly that we do not need any holiday.
('53', 479, 1, 5, 942849) Every minute that we have is really pledged to this work and no other.

('53', 479, 4, 8, 943086) LONDON, [On or before October 11,1931 ] 2
('53', 479, 5, 9, 943128) GANDHIJI : If she wants to draw typical peasants, 3 she should not go to Gujarat.
('53', 479, 5, 10, 943210) Gujarat is relatively prosperous.
('53', 479, 5, 11, 943244) She should go to Orissa.
('53', 479, 5, 12, 943269) There the peasants are nothing but skin and bone.
('53', 479, 5, 13, 943319) Even the bullocks are mere skeletons.
('53', 479, 5, 14, 943357) You can see their ribs.
('53', 479, 5, 15, 943381) She must certainly go to Orissa.
('53', 479, 5, 16, 943414) An artist can help by showing the world how these peasants live.
('53', 479, 6, 17, 943479) THE ARTIST: How long will it be before you can raise them into a fine race?
('53', 479, 6, 18, 943555) Isnt malaria a great obstacle?
('53', 479, 7, 19, 943586) G. Malaria is quite easy to eradicate.
('53', 479, 7, 20, 943625) Its all a matter of diet.
('53', 479, 7, 21, 943651) It can be cured with plenty of milk and fruit.
('53', 479, 8, 22, 943698) THE ARTIST : I suppose you will have to educate them to this diet.
('53', 479, 8, 23, 943765) G. Its not education they require.
('53', 479, 8, 24, 943800) They know perfectly well
('53', 479, 9, 25, 943825) 1 Extracted from Brailsfords own account of the interview.
('53', 479, 9, 26, 943884) The artist figuring in the text was a friend of Brailsford.
('53', 479, 9, 27, 943944) 2 October 12, the day preceding the date of publication, was a Silence Day.
('53', 479, 9, 28, 944020) Presumably, therefore, the interview took place on October 11, or a little before.
('53', 479, 9, 29, 944103) 3 Brailsford had said that the painter was eager to paint peasant life in India.
('53', 480, 0, 1, 944184) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 481
('53', 480, 1, 2, 944228) what they need.
('53', 480, 1, 3, 944244) Its poverty thats the difficulty.
('53', 480, 1, 4, 944278) We can grow the fruit in India, yet the peasants never eat it.
('53', 480, 1, 5, 944341) You cant grow it in England, yet your poor have it to eat.
('53', 480, 1, 6, 944400) The people here in the slums round about live as well as the middle class in India.
('53', 480, 1, 7, 944484) When I think of the poverty in which the peasants live, I feel ashamed that I have fruit to eat and fruit juice to drink.
('53', 480, 1, 8, 944606) We can do nothing so long as we have this octopus bleeding us white, draining us and taxing us all the time.
('53', 480, 1, 9, 944715) Why, they even tax our salta necessity of life, only less necessary than air and water.
('53', 480, 1, 10, 944803) It ought to be free as they are.
('53', 480, 1, 11, 944836) I know you pay a rate for water in England.
('53', 480, 1, 12, 944880) But this salt tax is worse than a rate.
('53', 480, 1, 13, 944920) Its a monopoly.
('53', 480, 1, 14, 944936) The idea of a thing so natural and necessaryafter air and water the one thing necessary,the idea of it being taxed!
('53', 480, 1, 15, 945052) Nature bestows it on us and we may not use it.
('53', 480, 1, 16, 945099) Theres the salt beside the sea and they forbid us to gather it.
('53', 480, 2, 17, 945163) H. N. B. When you abolish the salt tax what substitute will you propose to fill the hole in the revenue?
('53', 480, 3, 18, 945268) G. Salt is a small matter.
('53', 480, 3, 19, 945295) What really matters is the excise on toddy and opium.
('53', 480, 3, 20, 945349) That is really a big proportion of the revenue.
('53', 480, 3, 21, 945397) Theres no way of filling that gap.
('53', 480, 3, 22, 945432) unless we can cut down the cost of the army.
('53', 480, 3, 23, 945477) That is the octopus that is strangling us.
('53', 480, 3, 24, 945520) This terrible drain must come to an end.
('53', 480, 4, 25, 945561) H. N. B. That, I imagine will be the chief issue at the Round Table Conference.
('53', 480, 5, 26, 945641) G. Indeed it will: we cant shirk it.
('53', 480, 6, 27, 945678) THE ARTIST : Do you intend, then, to clear out the white garrison?
('53', 480, 7, 28, 945745) G. Certainly I intend to clear it out.
('53', 480, 8, 29, 945784) THE ARTIST : Do you include the civilians with the troops?
('53', 480, 9, 30, 945843) G. They are part of the burden we have to carry; they make government too costly.
('53', 480, 9, 31, 945925) There is no justificaiton for the great salaries they draw.
('53', 480, 9, 32, 945985) They live far better than the same class at home.
('53', 480, 10, 33, 946035) H. N. B. : Isnt there something to be said for the usual explanation of these high salaries?
('53', 480, 10, 34, 946128) These civilians are living in exile and in a very trying climate.
('53', 480, 11, 35, 946194) G. That is no longer so.
('53', 480, 11, 36, 946219) Better communications have changed all that.
('53', 480, 11, 37, 946264) There is a mail twice a week: they can keep in touch with thier families at home, and they go to the the hills in the hot weather.
('53', 480, 11, 38, 946395) We would welcome them if they would live among us like Indians.
('53', 480, 11, 39, 946459) But they isolate themselves.
('53', 480, 11, 40, 946488) They shut themselves up in their cantonments.
('53', 480, 11, 41, 946534) The very name has a military flavour, and, indeed, these cantonments
('53', 481, 0, 1, 946603) 482 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 481, 1, 2, 946645) are still under military law.
('53', 481, 1, 3, 946675) Any house within them may be seized if the military say they require it.
('53', 481, 1, 4, 946748) That happened to a mutual of ours, though he had built the house for himself.
('53', 481, 2, 5, 946826) H. N. B. There are two distinct questions about the army, or rather theres one question with two branches.
('53', 481, 2, 6, 946933) Theres the question of principle, Indias control over the army, and theres the economic question, which would be satisfied by the reduction of the army.
('53', 481, 2, 7, 947086) Must you insist on both?
('53', 481, 3, 8, 947111) G. I must see to it that I have control over my army.
('53', 481, 4, 9, 947165) H. N. B. : A nation is not fully a nation unless she has it.
('53', 481, 5, 10, 947226) G. They tell me that I must have this army to protect me against the Pathans.
('53', 481, 5, 11, 947304) I dont want its protection.
('53', 481, 5, 12, 947332) I want to be free to take my own course.
('53', 481, 5, 13, 947373) I may decide to fight them: I may decide to conciliate them.
('53', 481, 5, 14, 947434) But I want to be free to do it myself.
('53', 481, 5, 15, 947473) We would agree for a time to maintain some of the white army in India, but they tell us that Tommies cant be transferred to the control of an Indian Government.
('53', 481, 6, 16, 947634) H. N. B. They cant be transferred without their consent.
('53', 481, 6, 17, 947691) I should think that many of them would agree to re enlist, under satisfactory conditions, in an Indian army.
('53', 481, 7, 18, 947800) G. Yes, that might be the solution, but when the army is reduced, Im afraid that will add to the number of your unemployed.
('53', 481, 8, 19, 947924) H. N. B. : Would you, then, if the Principle of Indias control were granted, be willing to negotiate over the numbers and cost of the reduced white garrison which you would be willing to maintain for a term of years?
('53', 481, 9, 20, 948141) G. Yes, we will agree to anything of that kind, if it is in the interest of India.
('53', 481, 10, 21, 948224) H. N. B. Well, I think that would be rather to our interest than yours.
('53', 481, 11, 22, 948296) G. All the same, we would agree to that.
('53', 481, 12, 23, 948337) H. N. B. Its the principle of control that makes the difficulty.
('53', 481, 12, 24, 948402) I dont think youll get that.
('53', 481, 12, 25, 948431) Reduction is another matter; in some degree youll get that.
('53', 481, 12, 26, 948491) We are going into the Disarmament Conference presently: this might be part of our contribution to world disarmament.
('53', 481, 13, 27, 948608) G. Ive said what I want.
('53', 481, 13, 28, 948633) My terms are known.
('53', 481, 13, 29, 948653) But they are all holding back, as if they were afraid to say what theyll grant.
('53', 481, 13, 30, 948733) But Im quite prepared to wait.
('53', 481, 14, 31, 948764) H. N. B. Things are bound to move slowly while we are absorbed in our economic crisis.
('53', 481, 14, 32, 948851) That may be an advantage, however.
('53', 481, 14, 33, 948886) A wise statesman could make a reasonable settlement without the fear of popular clamour.
('53', 482, 0, 1, 948975) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 483
('53', 482, 1, 2, 949019) G. What has astonished me is the friendliness of the workers whom I have been meeting here in Bow.
('53', 482, 2, 3, 949118) THE ARTIST : Its the middle class that is hostile.
('53', 482, 3, 4, 949169) G. Ill get at them through the workers.
('53', 482, 3, 5, 949209) The real difficulty is that they have no conception of what India is suffering.They sincerely believe that India is the brightest jewel in the British crown.
('53', 482, 3, 6, 949367) They are honestly proud of the record of British rule.
('53', 482, 3, 7, 949422) It never enters their mind that there can be anything amiss.
('53', 482, 4, 8, 949483) THE ARTIST : Im only an outsider, but isnt there another difficulty?
('53', 482, 4, 9, 949552) Are not the Indian Princes the worst obstacle in your path?
('53', 482, 5, 10, 949612) G. A Prince is in the same position as a British Officer; he has to obey.
('53', 482, 6, 11, 949686) H. N. B. Then can you leave the Princes under the control of the Viceroy?
('53', 482, 7, 12, 949760) G. We must get control for the Indian Government.
('53', 482, 8, 13, 949810) H. N. B. But dont they prefer to be under the Viceroy?
('53', 482, 9, 14, 949865) G. Ask any of them, and theyll say so.
('53', 482, 9, 15, 949904) But deep down in their heart of hearts is it possible that they can be content?
('53', 482, 9, 16, 949984) After all, theyre the same colour as we are.
('53', 482, 9, 17, 950029) They are Indians.
('53', 482, 10, 18, 950047) H. N. B. But they gain something under the present arrangement which you could never allow.
('53', 482, 10, 19, 950139) The bureaucracy exact politeness from them, and political correctitude, but it allows them to treat their subject to pretty much as they please.
('53', 482, 11, 20, 950284) G. "Politeness" isnt the word for it.
('53', 482, 11, 21, 950322) Say rather abject submission.
('53', 482, 11, 22, 950352) Not one of them can call his soul his own.
('53', 482, 11, 23, 950395) The Nizam may start some project or other.
('53', 482, 11, 24, 950438) An angry letter from the Viceroy is enough to stop him.
('53', 482, 11, 25, 950494) You know what happened in Lord Readings time.
('53', 482, 12, 26, 950540) H. N. B. Apart from this question of control, is there any hope of legislation on behalf of your half starved millions if the Princes are to nominate 40 per cent of the membership of the Federal Legislature ?
('53', 482, 13, 27, 950749) G. We can deal with them as we have dealt with you.
('53', 482, 13, 28, 950801) It will be much easier.
('53', 482, 14, 29, 950825) H. N. B. I think their reply would be rather more brutal than ours.
('53', 482, 14, 30, 950893) We used the lathi.
('53', 482, 14, 31, 950912) They would use the rifle.
('53', 482, 15, 32, 950938) G. Thats your race pride.
('53', 482, 15, 33, 950964) Thats right.
('53', 482, 15, 34, 950977) I like you for it.
('53', 482, 15, 35, 950996) All of us ought to have it.
('53', 482, 15, 36, 951024) But you dont realize how much British power in India rests on prestige.
('53', 482, 15, 37, 951096) Indians are hypnotized by it.
('53', 482, 15, 38, 951126) You are a brave race, and your reputation enables you to overawe us.
('53', 482, 15, 39, 951195) Ive seen the same thing in South Africa.
('53', 482, 15, 40, 951236) The Zulus are a fighting race and yet a
('53', 483, 0, 1, 951276) 484 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 483, 1, 2, 951318) Zulu will tremble at the sight of a revolver, even if it isnt loaded.
('53', 483, 1, 3, 951388) If we get into conflict with the Princes, they wont have the advantage of your prestige.
('53', 483, 1, 4, 951477) If our people have to face Mahratta troops, they will say to themselves: We are Mahrattas, too. Talking of South Africa gives me a precedent for the change that we want to bring about in our relations with the Princes.
('53', 483, 1, 5, 951696) Swaziland used to be under the control of Downing Street, but when the Union was formed control was transferred to it.
('53', 483, 1, 6, 951815) In the same way we argue that the Princes ought to be transferred to the control of an Indian Government.
('53', 483, 2, 7, 951921) THE ARTIST : Will you have any use for British goods when India is free?
('53', 483, 3, 8, 951994) G. Yes, we shall still want what you export, with one exception.
('53', 483, 3, 9, 952059) We shall want everything except cotton goods.
('53', 483, 3, 10, 952105) Those we must make ourselves.
('53', 483, 4, 11, 952135) H. N. B. A Considerable part of our exports consists of machinery.
('53', 483, 4, 12, 952202) Will you have use for that?
('53', 483, 5, 13, 952230) G. Certainly.
('53', 483, 5, 14, 952244) Why, I use machinery myself for making soap and I imported it from England.
('53', 483, 5, 15, 952320) It is only the devoted few who can live the simple life without machinery.
('53', 483, 5, 16, 952395) The masses will never do without it.
('53', 483, 5, 17, 952432) All the same, it is possible to do wihout it.
('53', 483, 5, 18, 952478) Most of the things that we were taught to consider necessary are not necessary at all.
('53', 483, 5, 19, 952565) Take soap, now.
('53', 483, 5, 20, 952581) Ive used one cake of soap for three months, and it isnt nearly finished yet.
('53', 483, 5, 21, 952658) It is not really necessary to keep the body nice, though I used to think so myself, and used it lavishly when I was a young man.
('53', 483, 5, 22, 952787) Civilization, a cultured life with a place in it for literature and the arts, is possible wihout the artificial wants the machinery has created.
('53', 483, 5, 23, 952932) But I dont deceive myself: I know that the masses will never lead such a life.
('53', 483, 5, 24, 953011) It is for the few.
('53', 483, 5, 25, 953030) Its amazing how these absured artificial wants swell the volume of trade.
('53', 483, 5, 26, 953104) Ive learnt that from the boycott.
('53', 483, 5, 27, 953138) Who would have thought that toys and Chinese fireworks mattered ?
('53', 483, 5, 28, 953204) Yet you export vast quantities of such things into India.
('53', 483, 5, 29, 953262) We have learned in these months the tremendous power of the boycott; indeed, we are only just beginning to realize it fully now.
('53', 483, 5, 30, 953391) When I started it I was thinking only of cloth, but all manner of little trades are involved as well, even perfumes.
('53', 483, 5, 31, 953508) Im sorry for all the little people who were hurt by it, though I dont care so much about the big combines in Lancashire.
('53', 483, 6, 32, 953629) H. N. B. Yes, the boytctt had a great effect.
('53', 483, 6, 33, 953675) If you go back, the British attitude towards Indian self government seems almost incredible.

('53', 484, 1, 5, 953951) I dont expect anything from this Conference.
('53', 484, 1, 6, 953996) I came because I gave Lord Irwin my promise to attend it and discuss everything.

('53', 484, 7, 15, 954478) LONDON, W., October 12, 1931
('53', 484, 8, 16, 954507) MY DEAR HENRY, Yes, I have read the Times report.
('53', 484, 8, 17, 954557) I am not guilty.
('53', 484, 8, 18, 954574) There being nothing conclusive about the conversations what could I report!
('53', 484, 8, 19, 954650) I did report the relevant part to the informal committee.
('53', 484, 8, 20, 954708) Like all Times reports, this is one sides, inspired and mischievous.
('53', 484, 8, 21, 954777) Far more mischievous things have appeared in that paper and it has ignored contradictions.
('53', 484, 8, 22, 954868) But the being shocked of friends matters.
('53', 484, 8, 23, 954910) How to remedy the mischief I do not know.
('53', 484, 8, 24, 954952) Step into the breach and show the way.
('53', 484, 8, 25, 954991) I am too shy to push myself forward.
('53', 484, 8, 26, 955028) I have no secrets of my own.
('53', 484, 8, 27, 955057) I am anxious to meet all friends and receive their help and offer them such services as are within my power.
('53', 484, 8, 28, 955166) You know the disease, you know me and the complainants.
('53', 484, 8, 29, 955222) You should find the remedy and apply it.

('53', 485, 2, 3, 955483) October 12,1931
('53', 485, 3, 4, 955499) NARANDAS, I got the letters from you all, but I simply get no time here to write.
('53', 485, 3, 5, 955581) You should, therefore, be satisfied with what the other four members of the party write.
('53', 485, 3, 6, 955670) Today is Monday and the Committee is not meeting.
('53', 485, 3, 7, 955720) That is how I have the time to write this letter.
('53', 485, 3, 8, 955770) There are, of course, some persons sitting near me, but they are talking among themselves and I am writing this while they are doing so.
('53', 485, 3, 9, 955907) I see that Chhaganlal and you are not able to work together in any matter.
('53', 485, 3, 10, 955982) Have a talk with him now.
('53', 485, 3, 11, 956008) He is unhappy.
('53', 485, 3, 12, 956023) If nothing comes of your talk, the matter will have to wait till I return.
('53', 485, 3, 13, 956098) How is it that Jamna has again fallen ill?
('53', 485, 4, 14, 956141) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] Surajbhans story is pathetic.
('53', 485, 4, 15, 956197) He must have calmed down now.
('53', 485, 4, 16, 956227) I understand what you say about Rukmini.

('53', 485, 7, 19, 956360) LONDON, October 12, 1931
('53', 485, 8, 20, 956385) He thanked Mr. Henderson for.
('53', 485, 8, 21, 956415) taking the trouble to come to this meeting to show what support and sympathy I am to expect from you.
('53', 485, 8, 22, 956517) Mr. Gandhi invited his audience to ask questions, and said that frank speaking was the most helpful.
('53', 485, 8, 23, 956618) He said he would answer the questions without any mental reservations.
('53', 485, 8, 24, 956689) Continuing, Mr. Gandhi said: Though I am here for the Conference, I believe my work lies outside the Conference in making contacts like this.
('53', 485, 8, 25, 956831) In the Confe rence, however anxious I am to pour out my heart and lay all my
('53', 485, 9, 26, 956908) 1 The reception was arranged at Caxton Hall.
('53', 485, 9, 27, 956953) Arthus Henderson presided.

('53', 486, 1, 2, 957024) cards on the table, I, like every other delegate, am subjected to certain restrictions which I must observe.
('53', 486, 1, 3, 957133) I am, therefore, not successful in presenting my whole case.
('53', 486, 1, 4, 957194) Even though I believe I may have to go empty handed, in spite of all my efforts for an amicable settlement, I shall have the fullest satisfaction if I have been able to present my case to those who are earnest about India, but unfortunately are not fully informed about the Congress.
('53', 486, 1, 5, 957478) I claim that Congress represents in an overwhelming manner the masses of India, and I ask you to accept it that I have come here to plead for that independence for which thousands and thousands of men and women courted imprisonment, received lathi blows, and for which some even laid down their precious lives.
('53', 486, 1, 6, 957789) Complete independence does not exclude partnership on an absolute equality basis with Great Britain, terminable by either party.
('53', 486, 2, 7, 957918) Mr. Gandhi then stated the Congress claim, and the discretion that he was permitted to exercise in the matter of reservation and safeguards.
('53', 486, 3, 8, 958059) He added that Lord Irwin, of all Englishmen, was able to draw him to England .
('53', 486, 3, 9, 958138) Referring to safeguards in the interest of India, Mr. Gandhi said that the safeguards would be in mutual inerest, as he would not have adjustments that did moral harm to Britain, though some of them might mean material loss.
('53', 486, 3, 10, 958363) We in India have come to the conclusion that some of the transactions of the British Government are of questionable character, causing terrible economic loss to the Indian people.
('53', 486, 3, 11, 958543) It is necessary that is doing belated justice to India, Britain must sufer some material loss.
('53', 486, 4, 12, 958638) Concluding, Mahatma Gandhi expressed the fervent hope that the future historian would say that India fought and won liberty without shedding blood.
('53', 486, 5, 13, 958786) Q. If we withdrew entirely the control of the British Army in India, would
('53', 486, 6, 14, 958861) there not be internecine strife between Hindus and Muslims and would it not
('53', 486, 7, 15, 958937) materialize into a serious and terrible condition?
('53', 486, 7, 16, 958988) People from India assure me that that
('53', 486, 8, 17, 959026) would be the case.
('53', 486, 9, 18, 959045) A. It is a good question and it is a question that has been asked on so many occasions ever since I have come here and in India also.
('53', 486, 9, 19, 959179) My answer is that it is possible.
('53', 486, 9, 20, 959213) It is likely that we the Hindus and Muslims may fight one another if the British Army is withdrawn.
('53', 486, 10, 21, 959313) 1 The report up to this point is from Indian News.
('53', 486, 10, 22, 959364) What follows is from Amrita Bazar Patrika.
('53', 487, 0, 1, 959407) 488 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 487, 1, 2, 959449) Well, if such is to be our lot, I do not mind it.
('53', 487, 1, 3, 959499) It is quite likely.
('53', 487, 1, 4, 959519) Only if we dont go through the ordeal now, it will simply be postponement of the agony and, therefore, I personally do not mind it a bit and the whole of the Congress which today sways the votes or the minds of millions of people has decided to run the risk of it.
('53', 487, 1, 5, 959784) At the same time, my own hope is that, if we are really fighting non violently and truthfully, we shall be able to avoid that calamity.
('53', 487, 1, 6, 959920) But what puzzles me is this: Why should British administrators or the British general public worry their heads about what is going to happen when the British Army is withdrawn?
('53', 487, 1, 7, 960097) Why would they not recall their own history?
('53', 487, 1, 8, 960142) Did the British people themselves not run the maddest risks imaginable in order to retain their liberty?
('53', 487, 1, 9, 960247) Did they not have the terrible Wars of the Roses?
('53', 487, 1, 10, 960297) Did they not fight, the English against the Scots?
('53', 487, 1, 11, 960348) Was there not fighting even between Englishmen and Irishmen?
('53', 487, 1, 12, 960409) If you keep a foreign rule imposed, you will find the rot of emasculation going deeper and deeper and you come to the impossible barrier that these people cannot defend themselves against each other and therefore we must remain there as eternal rulers.
('53', 487, 1, 13, 960662) Therefore I would rather run any risk that may be in store and get freedom today.
('53', 487, 2, 14, 960744) Q. What is it exactly that the two parties of Hindus and Muslims are afraid of ?
('53', 487, 3, 15, 960825) A. I dont know that Hindus and Muslims have raised this question.
('53', 487, 3, 16, 960891) Not that they have not that fear, but the question has been raised on behalf of the administrators and not on behalf of the Indians or India as I Know.
('53', 487, 3, 17, 961043) But I shall give you what is today activating the Hindu Muslim mind.
('53', 487, 3, 18, 961112) The Hindus, who have been called the gentle Hinduwhich is often considered a euphemism for cowardiceunfortunately have the fear that it is possible that when British troops are withdrawn, hordes from the North West may overrun India and may inflict all kinds of losses upon her.
('53', 487, 3, 19, 961391) There is certainly that fear, but we must run that risk.
('53', 487, 3, 20, 961448) Muslims say, they are less literate, less numerous and not as well off economically as the Hindus.
('53', 487, 3, 21, 961547) Therfore, they did not know what is going to happen to them.
('53', 487, 3, 22, 961608) The Hindus, after all, before the British came, were able to live with the Mussalmans on free and equal terms.
('53', 487, 3, 23, 961719) There are today several thousand villages in India and in the majority of these there is a very sparse Muslim population.
('53', 488, 0, 1, 961841) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 489
('53', 488, 1, 2, 961885) They are, however, living together in perfect peace among themselves.
('53', 488, 1, 3, 961955) Go to the Punjab and Bengal and throw in Sind, you will find thousands of villages where the predominant population is Muslim with a few Hindus.
('53', 488, 1, 4, 962100) Ask me if those Hindus are afraid of their very lives.
('53', 488, 1, 5, 962155) If they were afraid, they would not be living in thsoe villages.
('53', 488, 1, 6, 962220) If you go to Baluchistan, overwhelmingly Muslim, you will find solitary Hindus carrying on trade there and, generally speaking, you can accept my evidence that they are not living in fear of their lives.
('53', 488, 1, 7, 962424) Again, you would find in Kabul not one but numerous Hindus and more Sikhs.
('53', 488, 1, 8, 962499) It comes to this that this so called fear is really more or less manufactured and is not so much fear as the desire for the exercise of power.
('53', 488, 1, 9, 962642) It is not a high ambition.
('53', 488, 1, 10, 962669) I admit, but no one is free from this ambition in the worldnot even the Labour Party.
('53', 488, 2, 11, 962755) Q. Bearing in mind the developments of the smaller States of Europe which have been granted their freedom since the War, does not Mr. Gandhi think that there is a danger of India, if she pursues her present policy, developming a bellicose nationalism which will be a menace to the world?
('53', 488, 2, 12, 963043) And does not Mr. Gandhi think it would be a dangerous ideal that he would be willing to sacrifice a million lives in order to attain freedom?
('53', 488, 3, 13, 963185) A. I do not think it to be a dangerous ideal to sacrifice your own life and these precious lives will be sacrificed by a nation that is living in compulsory disarmament.
('53', 488, 3, 14, 963355) I am afraid that our friend has not perhaps listened as carefully as I would have expected, or to speak chivalrously, I was not capable of making my meaning quite clear.
('53', 488, 3, 15, 963525) India today is wedded to non violence and therefore there is no question of taking someone elses life.
('53', 488, 3, 16, 963628) We do not consider our lives so cheap as to be given away for nothing, but we do not consider our lives to be dearer then liberty itself, and thereore, if we had to sacrifice a million lives, we would do so tomorrow, and God above would say nothing but Well done my chilldren.
('53', 488, 3, 17, 963905) We are trying to gain our liberty; you, on the other hand, have been an imperialistic minded race.
('53', 488, 3, 18, 964004) You have been in the habit of committing frightfulnessand as the late General Dyer put it in answer to a question in Court: Yes, I did this frightfulness deliberately. I am here to say that General Dyer was not the only one capable of resorting to this frightfulness.
('53', 488, 3, 19, 964272) You dont want me to multiply these illustrations from your
('53', 489, 0, 1, 964331) 490 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 489, 1, 2, 964373) own history, therefore, I do not think anyone in this Hall would criticize us if we sacrificed ourselves in this attempt to gain our liberty.
('53', 489, 1, 3, 964515) It is up to you, those who are trustees of the honour of the British nation, to prevent this disaster if you can.
('53', 489, 1, 4, 964629) My purpose in making these contacts is to put before you the elementary position and say: This is Indias right.
('53', 489, 2, 5, 964741) Q. Would we not be making a mistake in giving you independence?
('53', 489, 3, 6, 964805) A. I think you would if you gave independence to anyone.
('53', 489, 3, 7, 964862) And please therefore remember that I have not come to beg for independence but I have come as a result of last years suffering and at the end of that suffering, time came when we left India in order to see whether we have now sufficiently impressed the British mind with our suffering, so that I can go away with an honourable settlement.
('53', 489, 3, 8, 965201) But if I go away with an honourable settlement, I shall not go away with the belief that I have received any gift from this nation.
('53', 489, 3, 9, 965333) There is no such thing as a gift of independence from one nation to another.
('53', 489, 3, 10, 965410) It has got to be gained and bought with ones blood and I feel that we have already spilt sufficient of our own blood in the process which has gone on deliberately since 1919. But it may be that God, in His grace, considers that we have not suffered enough, that we have not gone through the process of purification.
('53', 489, 3, 11, 965726) Then I am here to testify that we shall continue the process of self sacrifice until at last no Britisher will want to remain in India as a ruler.
('53', 489, 4, 12, 965873) Q. What are Mr. Gandhis comments on the current belief that if the British withdrew from India, the Russians would wish to extend their sphere of influence by force over the country ?
('53', 489, 5, 13, 966057) A. I must confess to you that I do not believe in this or one moment.
('53', 489, 5, 14, 966127) Suppose Russia has such unholy designs upon India and thinks that she will succeed Britain in establishing an Empire there, I can only say that the same means which would have convinced the British of the impossibility of governing and the wisdom of withdrawing their Rule from India, will be the means that we propose successfully to adopt against Russia.
('53', 489, 5, 15, 966484) Imagine for one moment what Russia can possibly do agianst an
('53', 489, 6, 16, 966546) 1 The question is taken from Mahadev Desais London Letter in Young India, 29 10 1931.

('53', 490, 1, 2, 966676) unwilling people.
('53', 490, 1, 3, 966694) No people have yet been govenred by another nation against their will.
('53', 490, 1, 4, 966765) I hope and I believe my people have learned that co operation need not be rendered even reluctantly.
('53', 490, 1, 5, 966866) It carries with it some measure of sacrifice a sacrifice involving that non co operation.
('53', 490, 1, 6, 966956) If we refuse to trade with the Russians, take their goods and thier titles, receive their money, what will the Russians do or any other nation on earth do?
('53', 490, 1, 7, 967112) I admit that at the present moment India is not prepared to war against any nation, but I am hoping that I shall be able to utilize the opportunity to take my people along another step.
('53', 490, 1, 8, 967298) If you are satisfied that we have really suffered enough, that we have got unique means at our disposal in order to protect ourselves against foreign aggression and exploitatation through this non co operation and satyagraha; if you are satisfied, you will help me to gain this liberty for my people and you will find that people who have been able to gain liberty through these means are able to retain it through these means, then you will find that India will have made the largest contribution possible to the war against war.

('53', 491, 4, 5, 967987) MAHABALESHWAR, June 30, 1931 I have been asked by His Excellency the Viceroy to ascertain privately, before an official invitation is addressed to you, whether you are willing to serve on the Federal Structure Committee of the Round Table Conference in London from the 5th September next.

('53', 491, 8, 10, 968494) July 15/16, 1831
('53', 491, 9, 11, 968511) I saw Mr. Gandhi this afternoon.
('53', 491, 9, 12, 968544) He had not his papers with him relating to the alleged breaches of the Settlement, and our discussion was discursive covering a number of subjects, to some of which we shall return later.
('53', 491, 10, 13, 968732) 2. I asked him first about Gujarat.
('53', 491, 10, 14, 968768) on the whole, he seemed satisfied with the course of events there.
('53', 491, 10, 15, 968835) His chief complaint was about the issue of warning notices and coercive processes for collection of unauthorized arrears.
('53', 491, 10, 16, 968957) His main contention was that he himself and other Congress workers had assisted in the collection of land revenue and had honestly done their best to get revenue payers to pay as much as possible, that in some cases notices and processes had been issued without giving them the opportunity of collecting what was possible, and that generally he and his friends were in a better position to assess the capacity to pay than the officials.
('53', 491, 10, 17, 969394) I said that everyone was agreed that he himself had done his utmost to get the revenue payers to play the game, but that the same could not be said of some of his friends, and that the practical test of whether there had been deliberate delay in payment seemed to be provided by the fact that as soon as notices and processes were issued a large number of revenue payers immediately paid up.
('53', 491, 10, 18, 969786) There seemed to be no difference in principle between the Government of India, the local Government and

('53', 492, 0, 1, 969987) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 493
('53', 492, 1, 2, 970031) Mr. Gandhi.
('53', 492, 1, 3, 970043) All were agreed that anyone who could pay should pay whether the current years demand or unauthorized arrears, and the difficulty arose in particular cases as to whether payment was or was not possible.
('53', 492, 1, 4, 970246) He admitted that, despite his efforts, there might be some persons who deliberately shirked payment, but he claimed that collections had in fact exceeded the expectations of local officers and that the limit had practically been reached within which collections could reasonably be made.
('53', 492, 1, 5, 970534) He had apparently just seen the Collector of Surat, to whom he had proposed that the Congress assistance should be used to a greater extent in collections.
('53', 492, 1, 6, 970690) The Collector, he said, was non committal.
('53', 492, 1, 7, 970733) I took the opportunity of saying that the special circumstances in Gujarat had made it convenient in Kaira to have very close co operation between Government officials and Congress in the collection of land revenue, but that it was not possible to contemplate, as an ordinary feature of land revenue administration, the intervention of a third party, who practically decided what revenue could be paid, and I asked him what was to happen if the unauthorized ar rears now outstanding were formally suspended.
('53', 492, 1, 8, 971241) He said that they would be collectedas a matter of course after next harvest, provided of course that there were no seasonal calamities.
('53', 492, 1, 9, 971378) I suggested that in that case collections would have to be made next harvest in the ordinary course of land revenue administration, that Congress would disappear from the picture, and that processes, etc., would be issued in accordance with the ordinary canons.
('53', 492, 1, 10, 971640) Mr. Gandhi accepted this and said that he in fact was telling the revenue payers that Congress was not going to intervene after this harvest, that they must conserve their resources and be ready to pay anything that was not suspended.
('53', 492, 1, 11, 971875) I was careful not to suggest to Mr. Gandhi that the local Government were prepared to admit that the limit of present collections had been reached.
('53', 492, 1, 12, 972023) At the same time, the definite understanding that after this harvest revenue administration in Gujarat will revert to ordinary methods seems to be of some importance.
('53', 492, 2, 13, 972190) 3. I then said that lately allegations had been widely published that Government were guilty of breaches of the Settlement, that the latter did not admit that this charge had any foundation, and that on the contrary their case was that Congress had been guilty of serious breaches.
('53', 492, 2, 14, 972472) I distinguished between two classes of complaints, namely, first, allegations that specific clauses of the Settlement had not been observed, and secondly vague allegations which, when examined, did not constitute a breach within the terms of the Settlement, but had reference to action taken by local Governments in the course of ordinary administration.
('53', 492, 2, 15, 972827) I said that, generally speaking, we regarded the latter as not directly relevant to the Settlement and that they related to general issues which would be discussed later.
('53', 492, 2, 16, 972998) In regard to specific breaches, I instanced non release of prisoners, non restoration of property that had been seized, collection of the cost of additional police imposed in connection with the civil disobedience movement.
('53', 492, 2, 17, 973222) I said that Government were very anxious that they should not remain under any imputation of breaches of this kind,
('53', 493, 0, 1, 973338) 494 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 493, 1, 2, 973380) and reminded him that when I last saw him two months ago I asked him to give specific instances which he had not so far supplied.
('53', 493, 1, 3, 973510) He said that he had not done, because they had been trying to settle the cases direct with local Governments, but that he would let me have a list.
('53', 493, 2, 4, 973658) 4. We had some discussion about picketing, and he mentioned that he had just received a telegram from Rajagopalachari from Madras, saying that the local Government were definitely forbidding the picketing of liquor auction sales.
('53', 493, 2, 5, 973888) I said that in ignorance of the facts it was not possible to express an opinion whether the action of the local Government was justifiable or not, but, at any rate, even if picketing of auction sales came within the terms of the Settlement, I could not believe that it really advanced any temperance movement, and that generally the Congress appeared to be doing little permanent good by the methods they were pursuing.
('53', 493, 2, 6, 974308) I found it very difficult to believe that anyone, who wanted to bid at an auction in the hope of making profit if he was successful in obtaining the licence, would refrain from doing so unless there was an element of coercion or at least of inconvenience.
('53', 493, 2, 7, 974564) I told him that even in the case of those forms of picketing which came within the Settlement, Congress were making mistakes in arousing a great deal of resentment, and that feeling was growing.
('53', 493, 2, 8, 974759) I instanced the case of Jawaharlals action at Allahabad, and told him that both the District Magistrate and the local Government had seriously considered the necessity of an order under section 144 Cr.
('53', 493, 2, 9, 974961) P. C. in order to avoid the danger of a communal clash.
('53', 493, 2, 10, 975017) I made it clear to him that specific provisions of the Settlement must be subject to the requirements of public tranquillity, and that if picketing in any place endangered the public peace and, in particular, if it was likely to cause communal disturbances, there would be no hesitation in applying section 144 Cr.
('53', 493, 2, 11, 975332) P. C. He accepted this principle, but stated that as a matter of fact there was no danger of any trouble in Allahabad.
('53', 493, 2, 12, 975451) He said that Congress were avoiding the picketing of Muslim shops.
('53', 493, 2, 13, 975518) I told him that this was very advisable, since there is a movement among Muslims to picket Hindu picketers, and this might very well lead to clashes, also that there was a movement to encourage the trade in foreign cloth among the Muslims, and that this was again likely to create Hindu resentment against Congress methods.
('53', 493, 2, 14, 975842) The latter generally were creating a great deal of resentment, and only today I had received information from the Punjab Government that in one town the Hindu dealers had revolted.
('53', 493, 2, 15, 976023) Mr. Gandhi said that it was in fact difficult to get volunteers for picketing now that methods were unaggressive.
('53', 493, 2, 16, 976137) I mentioned to him the resolution passed by the Working Committee about the Congress not permitting the sale of foreign cloth.
('53', 493, 2, 17, 976264) I told him that the resolution had caused a great deal of criticism both in England and in India, and asked him that next time Congress found it necessary to enunciate their principles, they should do so in a form which was free from ambiguity and did not admit of wider interpretation than was intended.
('53', 493, 2, 18, 976569) I told him that we had thought that it might be
('53', 494, 0, 1, 976617) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 495
('53', 494, 1, 2, 976661) necessary to issue a communique explaining the position, and that we might still have to do so.
('53', 494, 2, 3, 976757) 5. We then had a long discussion about the agrarian situation in the United Provinces, which covered much the same ground as that covered in previous discussion on the subject.
('53', 494, 2, 4, 976934) I made it clear that Government had from the beginning regarded Congress activities in the U.P. as a very serious breach of the Settlement, and that 3 months ago Mr. Gandhi had been informed that the continuance of those activities would inevitably lead to trouble, which might force the local Government to take action under the ordinary law and also result in the application of special measures.
('53', 494, 2, 5, 977333) He said that if Government regarded the activities of Congress as a breach of the Settlement, it was open to them to denounce it, but the course they had taken was, while not denouncing the Settlement, to carry on war against Congress.
('53', 494, 2, 6, 977569) I explained that we had not denounced the Settlement, because we had hoped that the situation would improve and that things would settle down.
('53', 494, 2, 7, 977712) For the same reason we had refrained from publicly charging Congress with breaches of the Settlement, because we realized that once we embarked on charges and counter charges, the maintenance of the Settlement would be very difficult, but that it would be impracticable for us to continue.
('53', 494, 2, 8, 978002) this policy if ex parte statements continue to be made challenging the good faith of Government.
('53', 494, 2, 9, 978099) I then gave him briefly the information we had about the activities of the Congress in the U.P. He would not admit that this information was correct, and his general position was that taken up on previous occasions, namely, that Congress had always associated themselves with the kisans, that kisan sabhas were in fact Congress creations, and Congress could not dissociate themselves from the interests of the peasants without renouncing their creed.
('53', 494, 2, 10, 978550) I challenged his statement that Congress was identical with the kisans, and suggested to him that the close identity of interest had been developed since the Settlement and was part of the policy of consolidation in rural areas as preparation for a new fight, that it was mainly the last feature that inevitably made all local Governments look with suspicion on Congress activities and prevented them from co operating with Congress to the extent that otherwise would have been possible.
('53', 494, 2, 11, 979038) I said that it would be quite easy to prepare an indictment of Congress action in the U.P. which would convince world opinion that Congress had been dishonest.
('53', 494, 2, 12, 979198) His reply to this was that he had no apprehension whatsoever about a statement of Congress case in regard to the U.P. provided that the facts were correctly given.
('53', 494, 2, 13, 979362) He said that the outstanding facts were that the remissions were inadequate, that Government had always supported the landlords against the tenants and that the latter were not having a fair show.
('53', 494, 2, 14, 979559) He said that when he saw Sir Malcolm Hailey, the latter had admitted that remissions were not liberal enough, but had said that he must consider the financial situation and his duty to the administration.
('53', 494, 2, 15, 979764) I challenged this and I suggested that what Sir Malcolm Hailey had probably said in effect was that he
('53', 495, 0, 1, 979867) 496 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 495, 1, 2, 979909) had to maintain a balance between the claims of Government, of the landlords and of the tenants, and that while neither he nor anybody else could say with absolute certainty in present circumstances whether the right pitch of remissions had been reached, it could be claimed that those given represented a first approximation.
('53', 495, 1, 3, 980236) They were subject to the working principle, that if the actual process of collection showed that they were inadequate, then adjustment would follow as a matter of course, for it was the desire of the local Government that harsh methods of collections should not be employed either by Government or by landlords.
('53', 495, 1, 4, 980548) I repeated all the old arguments about the difficulties of Government having been greatly increased by Congress intervention.
('53', 495, 1, 5, 980674) Mr. Gandhi said that the situation in the U.P. was not dangerous or incapable of solution, and that a remedy could be found at once.
('53', 495, 1, 6, 980807) I asked him what it was.
('53', 495, 1, 7, 980832) He suggested that District officers should consult Congress workers and, more or less on their advice, fix the amount of revenue and rent to be collected.
('53', 495, 1, 8, 980987) I told him plainly that this was not a practical solution and that Government could not divest itself of the duty of determining these matters themselves, and that it would be as unreasonable for Government to accept the opinion of landlords as to what rent should be paid.
('53', 495, 1, 9, 981261) He then suggested that it might be possible to hold an enquiry, but admitted that Sir Malcolm Hailey had convinced him that a summary enquiry was out of the question.
('53', 495, 1, 10, 981428) We then discussed the question of whether a more elaborate enquiry would be possible with the object of ascertaining what temporary adjustments in revenue and rent were necessary as a result of the slump in the prices.
('53', 495, 1, 11, 981647) I made it quite clear to him that this was essentially a matter for the local Government and that, in the absence of their views and of local knowledge, our discussion was necessarily academic.
('53', 495, 1, 12, 981841) I suggested that even if on examination by the local Government such an enquiry were considered to be desirable, it would certainly extend over some months, that even the general recommendations would vary considerably between the various Divisions of the Province, that even in these Divisions they would be liable to local adjustments, and that further adjustments would be necessary from harvest to harvest as prices changed, that the enquiry would have to be carried out by technical experts and the smaller the committee the more effective its work was likely to be, that it would presumably be a public enquiry and receive evidence from landlords on the one side and tenants on the other, and if Congress representatives wished to produce facts and figures before it, there would appear to be no objection.
('53', 495, 1, 13, 982654) Mr. Gandhi appeared to be very keen on an enquiry of this kind and it seems to me that if it were possible to institute one at an early date it might do much to relieve the situation.
('53', 495, 1, 14, 982838) The matter seems to be one which merits consultation with the local Government.
('53', 495, 1, 15, 982918) I explained to Mr. Gandhi that even if such an enquiry were held, it could not affect present collections and that in regard to these the only possible course that I could see was for Government to proceed with collections, it being understood that they would, so far as possible, avoid coercive processes where land owners were generally unable to pay
('53', 496, 0, 1, 983271) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 497
('53', 496, 1, 2, 983315) and that while taking action under the law against tenants who contumaciously refuse to pay, they would not assist landlords in squeezing more out of the tenants than the latter could pay.
('53', 496, 2, 3, 983504) Mr. Gandhi was not entirely satisfied with this statement of the position in regard to present collections.
('53', 496, 2, 4, 983612) He claimed that many landlords were accepting the advice of the Congress and had recognized that it was to their advantage to do so.
('53', 496, 3, 5, 983745) 6. Before we parted, the North West Frontier Province was briefly mentioned.
('53', 496, 3, 6, 983822) I told him that it was our second cause of anxiety and that any day we might be forced to take action.
('53', 496, 3, 7, 983925) I told him the best thing he could do was to take Abdul Ghaffar Khan with him to London as one of his advisers.
('53', 496, 3, 8, 984037) He laughed and said that he could not do so, as he was not going to take any advisers.
('53', 496, 3, 9, 984124) He asked why we 1 did not get over the difficulty by inviting Abdul Ghaffar Khan as a Delegate to the Round Table Conference.
('53', 496, 3, 10, 984250) I said jokingly that he could not, in any ease, go as a Nationalist Muslim, since, as Mr. Gandhi knew, other Muslims very strongly objected to Nationalist Muslims going to the Conference as such.
('53', 496, 3, 11, 984446) He admitted that Abdul Ghaffar Khan could not go as a Nationalist Muslim but saw no reason why he should not go as a representative of the North West Frontier Province.
('53', 496, 3, 12, 984615) July 16, 1931
('53', 496, 4, 13, 984629) 7. My discussions with Mr. Gandhi continued on July 16th.
('53', 496, 4, 14, 984687) He began by reading out a fairly long list of alleged breaches of the Settlement by Government, and he gave me the list, a copy of which is attached.
('53', 496, 4, 15, 984837) So far as allegations of breaches of specific provisions of the Settlement are concerned, some are of a trivial character, some are too vague to allow of any provisional opinion to be formed, some are obviously outside the Settlement and a certain number are such as require the Government of India to satisfy themselves that no breach is involved.
('53', 496, 4, 16, 985186) In fact, having regard to the danger of a breakdown of the Settlement, it will probably be necessary to give local Governments the trouble of furnishing the facts in all cases, so that no allegation may be left unanswered if the necessity arose.
('53', 496, 4, 17, 985432) In addition to specific instances of alleged breaches of the Settlement, Mr. Gandhi gave a general note dealing with (a) Bombay, (b) the United Provinces, (c) the North West Frontier Province, and (d) the other Provinces.
('53', 496, 5, 18, 985654) It will be necessary to ask local Governments to give us the facts in regard to allegations contained in this note also.
('53', 496, 6, 19, 985775) 8. In regard to complaints about the North West Frontier Province, the only incident about which I had information was that at Sarband, the facts of which are
('53', 496, 7, 20, 985934) 1 The source has he.
('53', 497, 0, 1, 985955) 498 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 497, 1, 2, 985997) quite different from those presented in the note.
('53', 497, 1, 3, 986047) I gave Mr. Gandhi the facts and told him that the gross inaccuracy of the account given to him suggested that the other allegations might, to say the least of it, be much exaggerated.
('53', 497, 1, 4, 986231) I gave him some facts on the other side and explained to him the critical character of the situation in the North West Frontier Province with special reference to tribal areas, possible reactions in Afghanistan, contempt for authority which the Red Shirt movement was creating, the seditious speeches of Abdul Ghaffar Khan and the danger of the impression gaining ground that Government were afraid to tackle the movement, whereas the truth was that they were exercising, and intended to exercise, forbearance to the utmost limit in order to prevent a rupture, but that the limit might be reached any day.
('53', 497, 1, 5, 986837) Mr. Gandhi himself was clearly unhappy about the Frontier, and it played a comparatively small part in the general discussion and, in particular, in regard to the difficulties which Mr. Gandhi expressed himself as feeling about his attendance at the Round Table Conference.
('53', 497, 2, 6, 987111) He raised the question of his visit to the Frontier but did not press it.
('53', 497, 2, 7, 987185) I took the line that Government had no intention of forbidding a visit if he wished to go, but held the view that it was likely to complicate rather than assist the situation.
('53', 497, 2, 8, 987361) He said that Abdul Ghaffar had promised to obey any orders which Gandhi gave him and, in particular, had promised to see the Chief Commissioner, if the latter asked him to do so.
('53', 497, 3, 9, 987540) 9. In regard to the allegation that workers doing peaceful constructive work have been arrested in the Midnapore District, I explained to Mr. Gandhi the information we had received regarding the institution of parallel courts and the interference of Congress workers in criminal matters and their levying of fines.
('53', 497, 3, 10, 987855) I told him that the local Government had reported the situation to the Government of India, who had agreed that, in the first place, representation should be made to local Congress leaders, that if this had no effect, the ordinary law should be applied, and that if this again failed, the Association concerned should be declared unlawful association, provided that their activities went beyond the sphere of legitimate methods of arbitration.
('53', 497, 3, 11, 988299) He told me that he had in fact heard that the Congress had adopted his principles of arbitration (which excluded interference in criminal matters and also levying of fines or penalties).
('53', 497, 3, 12, 988486) A letter since received from the Bengal Government gives confirmation to this statement.
('53', 497, 3, 13, 988575) Mr. Gandhi also said that there were two parties in Midnapore, viz., the terrorist party and the Moderate Congress party, and that the latter were doing their best to oust the former.
('53', 497, 4, 14, 988759) 10. The greater part of the discussion today centered round the situation in the United Provinces, and, although this was taken at various times, it will be convenient to bring it together in its relation to representation of Congress at the Conference.
('53', 497, 4, 15, 989013) I abstained from asking Mr. Gandhi whether he was going to attend or not until a late
('53', 498, 0, 1, 989099) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 499
('53', 498, 1, 2, 989143) In reply he said that he wished to attend, but his attendance must be conditional on Government disengaging him from his responsibilities in India.
('53', 498, 1, 3, 989291) I asked him what exactly he meant.
('53', 498, 1, 4, 989326) He said that he could not contemplate a visit to England if he thought that while he was there he would be constantly receiving telegrams about lathi charges, prosecutions of members of Congress and generally repressive measures.
('53', 498, 1, 5, 989556) I said that it would be dishonest for Government to attempt to induce him to go to London on a definite assurance that no incidents would happen while he was away, that even in ordinary peaceful conditions, incidents were always happening in India, and the Government of India could not possibly fetter the discretion of local Governments in carrying out their responsibility for law and order in the manner that such an assurance would certainly involve, that, on the other hand, everyone wanted to avoid prosecutions and special measures, so far as this was possible, and that there had not been, and would not be, any inclination on the part of local Governments to take measures in excess of actual requirements that the best insurance against members of Congress being prosecuted was for them to keep within the law, and that where such prosecutions had been necessary it was evidence rather of a breach of the spirit of the Settlement by Congress than of a breach by Government, and generally that the only way of securing reasonable peaceful conditions was for the Congress to close down agitation and to suspend war preparations, at any rate for the next 3 or 4 months, until the Round Table Conference is over.
('53', 498, 1, 6, 990776) Government would certainly respond to action of this kind.
('53', 498, 1, 7, 990835) He said that he felt that Provincial Governments were out to kill the Congress and that, in particular, he had been told that members of the I.C.S. would be glad if Congress were not represented at the Round Table Conference.
('53', 498, 1, 8, 991061) I repudiated both these statements, and suggested to him that, in regard to the latter, it was ludicrous to suppose that the members of the Service largely responsible for law and order would welcome developments which might be expected greatly to increase their work and responsibility.
('53', 498, 1, 9, 991349) In regard to the supposed attitude of local Governments I reminded him that Government had on several occasions made it clear that the war preparations of Congress added greatly to their difficulties in co operating with the Congress, and that if local Governments had been forced to take action against members of the Congress it had been with great reluctance and only because their activities made action unavoidable.
('53', 498, 1, 10, 991770) He pursued the argument (which he had adopted on several previous occasions), namely, that the Settlement between Government and Congress placed the latter in a special position which justified previous consultation with them before any action was taken against their members and that Government and Congress should work together in close unity.
('53', 498, 1, 11, 992116) I asked him what he had in mind, and he gave several specific examples.
('53', 498, 1, 12, 992188) He said that, for instance, a prosecution under section 124 A., I.P.C. should not be launched against a member of the Congress without giving the Congress an opportunity of bringing the person into the line.
('53', 498, 1, 13, 992396) I explained to him the existing principles on which prosecutions were launched under
('53', 499, 0, 1, 992481) 500 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 499, 1, 2, 992523) this section and I said that while, on particular occasions, it might be desirable to give a warning and that this course was sometimes followed, it was not possible to accept as a general rule that a person belonging to a particular organization, when he offended against the law, should be placed in a privileged position in comparison with other persons who did not belong to such an organization.
('53', 499, 1, 3, 992924) The next example he gave was that no proceedings under the security sections of the Criminal Procedure Code should be taken against a kisan in the United Provinces until the Congress had been given previous warning.
('53', 499, 1, 4, 993140) I asked him how the District Magistrate was to know that a particular kisan belonged to the Congress and declined to accept the suggestion that every kisan in the U.P. was a member of the Congress.
('53', 499, 1, 5, 993338) I also explained that the security sections were often used when there was imminent danger of breach of the peace and it was out of the question to expect the District Magistrate to delay what might be emergent proceedings while he was referring to a third party.
('53', 499, 1, 6, 993602) Mr. Gandhi, I think, realized that these particular suggestions were outside reasonable limits and did not press them.
('53', 499, 1, 7, 993721) He then [dealt with] the case of the United Provinces at great length and took the line that there was active war going on against the Congress as such.
('53', 499, 1, 8, 993874) I said that, so far as I understood the position, action was being taken against individuals, not because they were members of the Congress, but because they were carrying on particular activities and that similar action was being taken against persons who carried on such activities whether they were members of the Congress or not.
('53', 499, 1, 9, 994208) If a great majority of the persons against whom action was being taken were members of the Congress, this was because Congress were responsible for a campaign which was definitely assisting towards the creation of dangerous conditions.
('53', 499, 1, 10, 994444) I repeated the view of Government that the rent campaign of Congress in the United Provinces was a definite breach of the Settlement and that while one object might be the relief of the economic conditions of tenants, it was impossible to dissociate it from the declared policy of Congress to consolidate their position in rural areas in preparation for a new struggle if this were to occur.
('53', 499, 1, 11, 994836) Mr. Gandhi did not accept this statement and maintained the position that Congress had always been most closely interested in the welfare of the kisans and that they could not possibly forgo this part of their work.
('53', 499, 1, 12, 995052) I reminded him that just before the Settlement very little agitation of this kind was going on in the United Provinces and that it was since the Settlement that activities had been organized and conducted on a scale not previously known.
('53', 499, 1, 13, 995290) He claimed that Congress leaders and workers in the United Provinces were only desirous that tenants should not be made to pay more rent than they could reasonably pay, but he did admit that their aim was a radical change in the landlord system and the permanent alleviation of tenants conditions apart from the present crisis.
('53', 499, 1, 14, 995618) He disclaimed any intention of a confiscatory policy against landlords, but while I still think he is not prepared to go as far as Jawahar Lal, the general trend of his conversation today showed that the legitimate interests of landlords had a very
('53', 500, 0, 1, 995867) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 501
('53', 500, 1, 2, 995911) small part in his plans compared with the interests of tenants.
('53', 500, 1, 3, 995975) His aim is clearly to establish the position of Congress as the champion and mouthpiece of the tenants.
('53', 500, 1, 4, 996079) His case at present is that Government are taking side with the landlords against the tenants, are sanctioning rents which the tenants are unable to pay, are giving more than legitimate assistance to the landlords in their collection, and are condoning, if not approving, acts of oppression by bad landlords.
('53', 500, 1, 5, 996388) I, of course, strongly contested this view.
('53', 500, 1, 6, 996432) I asked him several times what his solution was of present difficulties in the U.P., and his reply was always the same that Government should definitely associate Congress with them and accept the advice of the Congress as to what rents should be collected.
('53', 500, 1, 7, 996690) I told him that this would mean that Government would abrogate its functions in favour of a political party that had taken up the side of the tenants against landlords and that it was quite impracticable.
('53', 500, 1, 8, 996895) He denied that this was his aim, but he was unable to give any alternative explanation of its practical effect.
('53', 500, 1, 9, 997007) I said that I myself could see no solution of immediate difficulties unless Congress called off its activities in the U.P. and left it to Government to do its utmost to preserve the balance between landlords and tenants.
('53', 500, 1, 10, 997228) He said that he might be willing to call off the whole force of volunteers and workers if Government gave an undertaking that they would not use coercive measures in assisting landlords to collect rents, but would leave the whole matter tomethods of persuasion.
('53', 500, 1, 11, 997490) We pursued this suggestion, but on examination it was found that it would involve, according to Mr. Gandhis ideas, the abstention of Government from executing the decree of landlords for possession against evictable tenants.
('53', 500, 1, 12, 997715) In other words, it would mean that tenants would pay as little as they liked without fear of consequences and that landlords would be left without the remedy secured to them by the law.
('53', 500, 1, 13, 997901) Mr. Gandhi had a good deal to say about evictions in general and stated that landlords were taking advantage, in many cases, of existing economic conditions to obtain the ejectment of statutory and occupancy tenants and to replace them by tenants at will.
('53', 500, 1, 14, 998157) This was a matter about which I could say little in ignorance of the facts, but did suggest that even if this were so, Congress were making matters much worse by embittering the relations between the two.
('53', 500, 1, 15, 998362) I then read out to him the portion of the weekly reports of the C.I.D., United Provinces, since the beginning of June relating to rural agitation.
('53', 500, 1, 16, 998509) He was obviously taken aback by the continuous record week after week and from district after district of the activities of Congress workers, and I fancy he felt that the presentation of the Government case would very gravely prejudice the success of the appeal which Congress evidently intend to make to world opinion, if there is a break.
('53', 500, 1, 17, 998850) He expressed regret that these reports had not been brought to his notice before.
('53', 500, 1, 18, 998932) I reminded him that in March he had been informed of activities in the United Provinces and of their dangerous possibilities, that early in April he had been given specific instances and had been told the view of the Government of India in regard to the action it would probably be necessary for the local Government to take, that, again in May, I had
('53', 501, 0, 1, 999284) 502 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 501, 1, 2, 999326) discussed with him at great length the.
('53', 501, 1, 3, 999366) situation and had given him many facts, that he had seen Sir Malcolm Hailey at Naini Tal and presumably had learnt from him also what was happening, that the position in the United Provinces for months past had reference not to isolated incidents but to a campaign organized by Congress on a very large scale, and that it was unreasonable to suppose that the local leaders did not know what was going on, even if they had not stated the facts to Mr. Gandhi.
('53', 501, 1, 4, 999824) We failed to make any further advance in regard to the United Provinces.
('53', 501, 1, 5, 999897) I said we would probably consult the local Government both in regard to present conditions and the possibility of an enquiry as to the future, that in regard to the former I could see no chance of a solution that would meet the point of view he had expressed and that in regard to the enquiry it was of course primarily a matter for the local Government.
('53', 501, 2, 6, 1000252) 11. Mr. Gandhis views regarding his attendance at the Round Table Conference, as expressed today, may be briefly interpreted as follows.
('53', 501, 2, 7, 1000389) He will not attend unless (a) Government can give a general assurance in regard to proceedings against members of Congress that would in effect place them in a privileged position in comparison with other members of the public and would effectually tie the hands of local Governments in carrying out their responsibilities for the maintenance of law and order, and (b) the local Government of the United Provinces scraps its present scheme of remissions, throws over the landlords and accepts the advice of Congress in regard to the pitch of rents, thus surrendering its functions to that body.
('53', 501, 3, 8, 1000984) We discussed the position many times from different points of view.
('53', 501, 3, 9, 1001052) These were the practical conclusions that invariably emerged.
('53', 501, 3, 10, 1001114) I doubt if he would seriously take his stand on (a) as a ground for rupture, and it is possible that he is bluffing about (b).
('53', 501, 3, 11, 1001241) If, however, Congress refuse participation in the Round Table Conference it will be mainly on the United Provinces issue supplemented by allegations of a general character regarding the supposed hostility of local Government towards Congress as such.
('53', 501, 4, 12, 1001492) 12. I told Mr. Gandhi that if he were himself to go to the Round Table Conference, there would, so far as I could see, be no difficulty in continuing liaison with the Government of India in matters regarding the Settlement through the nomination by Mr. Gandhi of a representative to take his place.
('53', 501, 4, 13, 1001791) I added the qualification, which he accepted as reasonable, that whoever the representative might be it would be up to him to avoid making speeches, etc., that might make meetings between him and the representative of the Government of India open to misunderstanding and misconception.
('53', 501, 5, 14, 1002077) 13. I did my utmost to convince Mr. Gandhi of the mistake Congress would
('53', 502, 0, 1, 1002150) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 503
('53', 502, 1, 2, 1002194) make if it refused to be represented at the Conference, and I used the various arguments employed on previous occasions.
('53', 502, 1, 3, 1002315) I emphasized the fact that the Settlement was only a means to an end, namely, to facilitate an agreed constitutional solution, that in its main features it was a temporary measure that the sooner it merged into the ordinary administrative machine the better for everyone, and that even if it were admitted that peaceful conditions could not be completely assured during the next few months, nonetheless the best means of obtaining ultimate peace was through the Round Table Conference.
('53', 502, 1, 4, 1002801) In particular I urged the influence he himself might exercise in London in facilitating a communal settlement and also the part he could play, if things went well in England, in convincing Indian public opinion of the sincerity of Great Britains intentions towards India.
('53', 502, 1, 5, 1003073) I emphasized the probable results of the decision of Con gress not to attend, and I suggested that the general verdict would be that Congress had shown a lamentable lack of political sagacity.
('53', 502, 1, 6, 1003266) I left him in no doubt that the Conference would go on whether the Congress decided to be represented or not.
('53', 502, 1, 7, 1003376) 14. Many times during our discussion Mr. Gandhi asked why, if Government considered that Congress had not observed the terms of the Settlement, they had not denounced it.
('53', 502, 1, 8, 1003547) I gave the obvious reasons.
('53', 502, 1, 9, 1003575) But the suggestion was made so often as definitely to indicate that it would have suited the Congress game better if Government had relieved Congress of the responsibility for running out.
('53', 502, 2, 10, 1003764) 15. I pointed out to Mr. Gandhi that the refusal of Congress to be represented at the Conference would mean that the Settlement had broken down in an essential respect.
('53', 502, 2, 11, 1003933) He agreed that this was so.
('53', 502, 2, 12, 1003961) I then asked him whether this meant that the Congress would restart the civil disobedience movement.
('53', 502, 2, 13, 1004062) He said that this was not necessarily the case, and I gathered that they would await the course of events.
('53', 502, 2, 14, 1004169) I pointed out to him that the failure of an essential part of the Settlement would inevitably weaken the sense of restraint which the maintenance of the Settlement had necessarily imposed and that this was an additional reason for keeping it intact.
('53', 502, 2, 15, 1004419) He recognized this and, I think, anticipates that once the decision is reached events are likely to move more rapidly than during the past four months.

('53', 503, 3, 4, 1004739) July 17, 1931
('53', 503, 4, 5, 1004753) I had one and a half hours conversation with Mr. Gandhi this afternoon.
('53', 503, 4, 6, 1004825) He traversed a good deal of the ground already covered in his conversations with
('53', 503, 5, 7, 1004906) Mr. Emerson, which it is unnecessary to recapitulate.
('53', 503, 5, 8, 1004960) I put strongly before him the obvious arguments in favour of his going to London, but on this point he still maintained a somewhat ambiguous attitude.
('53', 503, 5, 9, 1005111) The position to which he most obstinately adhered was that particularly in the United Provinces, the attitude of Government, or at least of its officers, was definitely hostile to Congress and to its members as such.
('53', 503, 5, 10, 1005328) He referred to instances in which members of Congress, who had made complaints to Magistrates courts, had received, as he considered, no redress.
('53', 503, 5, 11, 1005474) I pointed out that in that event the proper course was to take the case up on revision or appeal.
('53', 503, 5, 12, 1005572) He agreed to this, and said such steps were being taken.
('53', 503, 5, 13, 1005629) He mentioned also, a number of cases in which notices had been issued to kisans and others warning them against any contact or association with members of Congress.
('53', 503, 5, 14, 1005794) His most insistent plea was that there was a large number of cases in which, as he said, he was convinced the Settlement had been broken both in letter and in spirit.
('53', 503, 5, 15, 1005961) He considered the only possible means of enabling him to go to London would be some assurance that these cases would be examined by an impartial authority.
('53', 503, 5, 16, 1006117) By this, he said, he did not mean anything in the nature of a joint Congress and Government Arbitration Board to consider breaches of the Settlement, but something similar to the kind of impartial enquiry which, when there is a prima facie case of administrative abuse, the administration is ordinarily prepared to hold.
('53', 503, 5, 17, 1006438) His summing up was that unless he had some substantial assurance on this point, he would consider that his primary duty was to remain in India to preserve the peace rather than go to London.
('53', 503, 5, 18, 1006629) I endeavoured to dissuade him from this view, but without much success.
('53', 503, 5, 19, 1006701) He disavowed any intention of resuming the strife, and said that unless he could be convinced that he could safely go to London, his main object would be to maintain the peace in India in order that the Conference could proceed with its work.
('53', 503, 5, 20, 1006944) Our conversation was, throughout, perfectly friendly.

('53', 504, 2, 3, 1007178) LETTER FROM H. W. EMERSON 1
('53', 504, 3, 4, 1007206) SIMLA, July 30, 1931
('53', 504, 4, 5, 1007227) I write to thank you for your letter of July 21st, in which
('53', 504, 5, 6, 1007287) (a) you request that an impartial tribunal be appointed for the decision of matters of interpretation of the Settlement of March 5th, and
('53', 504, 6, 7, 1007425) (b) you state 11 specific points which you desire to be referred to the tribunal, if appointed, on failure of an agreement between Government and Congress as to their interpretation.
('53', 504, 7, 8, 1007608) In your previous letter of the 14th of June you made a suggestion for the
('53', 504, 8, 9, 1007682) appointment of a permanent Board of Arbitration to decide questions of interpretation
('53', 504, 9, 10, 1007768) of the Settlement and as to the full carrying out of the terms by the one party or the
('53', 504, 11, 11, 1007855) In my D.O. Ietter No.
('53', 504, 11, 12, 1007877) F. 33/1/31 Poll, of the 4th of July, 1931, reasons were
('53', 504, 12, 13, 1007933) given why Government were not able to accept the suggestion.
('53', 504, 13, 14, 1007994) 2. In your interview with His Excellency the Viceroy on July 21st, you expressed the view that, while it might not be possible for Government to accept the general proposition made in your letter of June 14th, it would be unreasonable for them to refuse to accept a more narrow proposal relating to arbitration on questions of interpretation of the Settlement.
('53', 504, 13, 15, 1008355) After some discussion, His Excellency suggested that you should communicate the specific points which you consider suitable for submission to arbitration, and he undertook that on their receipt the Government of India would examine the proposal.
('53', 504, 14, 16, 1008601) 3. The Government of India have given the matter their most careful consideration.
('53', 504, 14, 17, 1008684) They observe that while you do not wish to press, at the moment, for a tribunal to examine questions of fact in the event of difference between Government and the Congress, you do not waive this demand, and you suggest that occasions may arise when it may be necessary to press it.
('53', 504, 14, 18, 1008966) You will doubtless agree that the only distinction between this request and the suggestion made in your letter of the 14th of June is that you now desire to hold in suspense the broader question, while asking for the immediate agreement of Government to arbitration on questions of interpretation.
('53', 504, 14, 19, 1009264) For the reasons stated in my letter of the 4th July, the Government of India regret that they are unable to alter the views already expressed on the former question.

('53', 505, 1, 2, 1009514) 4. They have given further consideration to the more restricted proposal, namely, the reference to arbitration of questions relating to interpretation.
('53', 505, 1, 3, 1009666) In reaching a decision they have given particular attention to the eleven points stated in your letter, which you regard as coming within this category, and to the implications which acceptance of arbitration on these points would necessarily involve, with special regard to the responsibilities and functions inherent in Government.
('53', 505, 1, 4, 1010000) You will no doubt recognize that it would not be possible for Government to agree to any arrangement which involved the suspension of the ordinary law or of the regular machinery of administrations, or which included the appointment of an external authority to whom Government would delegate the responsibility for reaching decisions in matters closely affecting the administration, or of which the effect, direct or indirect, would be to provide special procedure, to the benefits of which members of the Congress could lay claim and from which other members of the public would be excluded and which would trench upon the jurisdiction and discretion of the courts of law.
('53', 505, 1, 5, 1010674) The Settlement of March 5 did not, of course, contemplate any provisions of this kind.
('53', 505, 2, 6, 1010761) 5. I am now to examine some of the points stated in your letter with reference to the above principles.
('53', 505, 2, 7, 1010865) The first three relate to picketing and are of a general character.
('53', 505, 2, 8, 1010933) The action that it may be necessary to take in particular cases of picketing is obviously dependent on the nature of the particular circumstances, and Government can clearly not agree to any decision of a general character which might have the effect of prejudicing this discharge by the executive or judicial authorities of their responsibility for the maintenance of law and order, or of interfering with the liberty of individuals.
('53', 505, 2, 9, 1011368) General references of the nature you suggest are precluded by these considerations.
('53', 505, 2, 10, 1011452) Nor can Government agree to the reference of particular cases, for, apart from the reasons given in my letter of July 4th, the effect would often be to give to the individuals concerned in them a position not enjoyed by members of the public in similar circumstances.
('53', 505, 3, 11, 1011720) In regard to the fourth point, the Government of India have no information which suggests that local Governments are condoning breaches of the excise law in the manner suggested.
('53', 505, 3, 12, 1011899) In so far as the matter relates to the administration of excise matters within the law, you will no doubt realize that it is not practicable to set up a tribunal with power to decide, in effect, how local Governments should conduct the administration of excise, which, it may be observed, is a provincial transferred subject.
('53', 505, 4, 13, 1012225) Points (10) and (11) raise a different issue, but one of great importance.
('53', 505, 4, 14, 1012300) The questions mentioned in them were neither discussed during the conversations leading to the Settlement, nor was any provision made in the Settlement regarding them.
('53', 505, 4, 15, 1012468) The reference of these matters to a tribunal would, therefore, involve acceptance of the
('53', 506, 0, 1, 1012557) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 507
('53', 506, 1, 2, 1012601) principle (which would clearly be capable of unlimited extension) that the tribunal should be competent to extend the operation of the Settlement beyond its original scope and intentiou, and without the concurrence of Government.
('53', 506, 2, 3, 1012831) 6. These instances appear to Government sufficiently to indicate that there are insuperable difficulties in the way of arbitration even although references be ostensibly confined to matters of interpretation.
('53', 506, 2, 4, 1013040) There would be constant disputes as to whether the matter was one of interpretation or not, and the arrangement would create new difficulties rather than remove old ones.
('53', 506, 3, 5, 1013211) 7. Several of the 11 points have in their general aspect already received the careful consideration of Government, and in this connection I would refer you to my letter No.
('53', 506, 3, 6, 1013384) D. 4291 Poll, dated the 2nd of July 1931, which related to students, and to my letter No.
('53', 506, 3, 7, 1013474) D. 380I 31 Poll, dated the 20th of June 1931, which related to arms licences.
('53', 506, 3, 8, 1013552) The list of alleged breaches of particular provisions of the Settlement which you gave to me at Simla contained specific nstances coming within most of the 11 points.
('53', 506, 3, 9, 1013719) This list was referred within a few days of its receipt to local Govern ments for communication of the facts, and the Government of India and local Govern ments will satisfy themselves as to whether any breach of the Settlement is involved.
('53', 506, 3, 10, 1013960) They are similarly prepared to satisfy themselves in regard to future cases of alleged breaches of specific provisions, for, it is a matter of honour with Government to observe the Settlement and they have no doubt that this is equally held by you.
('53', 506, 3, 11, 1014209) It is by approaching the matter in this spirit and not by resort to arbitration that Government believe that difficulties can best be surmounted.

('53', 506, 8, 17, 1014484) Emerson wrote to you officially yesterday regarding the proposals for arbitration, and I should like you to know that the proposals received the most careful consideration of my Government, and that they were only not accepted because the difficulties presented themselves as insuperable.
('53', 506, 8, 18, 1014773) This does not mean that your charge sheet, as you have called it, will not receive full attention.
('53', 506, 8, 19, 1014872) I have, of course, taken a personal interest in everything pertaining to the Settlement and shall continue to do so and, in particular, in regard to the list of alleged breaches of the Settlement, about which we await reports from local Governments.
('53', 506, 8, 20, 1015122) I know that in the Provinces the Governors similarly take a

('53', 507, 1, 2, 1015317) personal interest in matters connected with the Settlement, and you can rest assured that there will be no disposition to treat allegations of breaches of it other than as matters of importance.
('53', 507, 2, 3, 1015512) We have not yet received full reports regarding Gujarat but I hope that the difficulties are clearing up and that your discussion with the Bombay Government will prove satisfactory to everyone concerned.
('53', 507, 2, 4, 1015716) So far as my information goes, the general situation is rather easier than a month or even a fortnight ago, except for terrorist crime, which cannot fail to have important reactions if it continues, and for the position in the North West Frontier Province, which is a cause of much anxiety.
('53', 507, 2, 5, 1016007) I am glad to hear that you are doing all you can to stop the insensate campaign of assassination.
('53', 507, 3, 6, 1016105) I should like, with you, to feel that the atmosphere is entirely free from clouds, and you may be sure that I and my Government will unceasingly work towards this end.
('53', 507, 3, 7, 1016273) But I am quite sure that the best way to obtain a real and lasting solution of present difficulties is through the Round Table Conference, and that you can best assist the real interests of the country in sharing in this great constructive work.

('53', 507, 6, 10, 1016554) LETTER FROM R. M. MAXWELL 1
('53', 507, 7, 11, 1016582) GANESHKHIND, August 10, 1931
('53', 507, 8, 12, 1016611) I am directed by His Excellency to send you his considered reply on the points raised at your recent interview, so far as material is now available.
('53', 507, 8, 13, 1016760) As you will doubtless realize, some little time will be required to make enquiries about some of the more detailed matters which you mentioned, but His Excellency understands that it will be more convenient to you if his reply on the more important issues is not delayed until all other matters are cleared up.
('53', 507, 9, 14, 1017071) 2. His Excellency has carefully considered all the points you urged regarding land revenue collections in Gujarat, and particularly in Bardoli.
('53', 507, 9, 15, 1017215) On the information before him he is satisfied that no breach of the Settlement is involved in the steps taken to collect land revenue in Bardoli.
('53', 507, 9, 16, 1017361) It was clearly contemplated by the Settlement that the current demand and arrears would be paid promptly by all who could pay.
('53', 507, 9, 17, 1017488) The Collector did, however, show special forbearance in regard to the employment of coercive processes, and it was only after some months delay, and then only in carefully selected cases, that he resorted to them.
('53', 507, 9, 18, 1017702) The prompt response
('53', 507, 10, 19, 1017722) 1 Vide Interview to the Press, 4 8 1931, Telegram to Viceroy, 11 8 1931 & Telegram ato R. M. Maxwell, 11 8 1931
('53', 508, 0, 1, 1017834) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 509
('53', 508, 1, 2, 1017878) of the revenue payers and the negligible extent to which attachment became necessary showed then that there were many persons able to pay who had not done so, and established the fact that action had become necessary only in consequence of their failure to observe the Settlement.
('53', 508, 2, 3, 1018159) 3. Nor is His Excellency able to agree with you that there has been any breach of faith on the part of the Collector.
('53', 508, 2, 4, 1018277) All that the Collector undertook to do was to consider any lists which might be submitted to him by Congress workers conta ining the names of revenue defaulters whom they believed to be unable to pay either the whole or a part of their dues, just as he was also willing to consider applica tions of a similar character received direct from the Khatedars, while reserving the right to decide each case on its merits.
('53', 508, 2, 5, 1018693) Neither the Government nor the Collector have ever accepted the position that the collection of land revenue should be dependent on the advice of the Congress, and His Excellency has no doubt that you will yourself realize that the decision as to whether particular persons can or cannot pay must rest with the Collector.
('53', 508, 2, 6, 1019015) Holding, therefore, as he does, that there has been neither a breach of faith nor a breach of the Settlement in any action which has been taken, His Excellency in Council is unable to approve of the refund of any sums already collected.
('53', 508, 3, 7, 1019252) 4. I am to explain, however, that this particular issue is no longer one of practical importance for the following reasons.
('53', 508, 3, 8, 1019376) It is common ground that all who can now pay should do so, and further that normal methods of land revenue administration should be pursued when the time comes for the collection of the next instalment due in January or February next.
('53', 508, 3, 9, 1019611) The practical question, therefore, concerns the intervening period.
('53', 508, 3, 10, 1019679) With regard to this the usual practice is to allow measures of collection to slacken after the end of the land revenue year, i.e., the 31st July.
('53', 508, 3, 11, 1019825) In accordance with this practice active coercive measures would not ordinarily be resumed until after the end of the monsoon, and His Excellency has no doubt that in ordinary circumstances most of the balance of the arrears might have been recovered in October next.
('53', 508, 3, 12, 1020092) I am, however, to inform you that in view of the special circumstances of this year and in order to facilitate the working of the the Settlement, His Excellency in Council has decided not to adopt any further coercive measures for the collection of arrears unless they remain unpaid at the time of the next instalment, i.e., in January or February, 1932.
('53', 508, 4, 13, 1020447) 5. The position therefore is that those who can now pay should freely do so, and that any arrears then outstanding will be collected together with the current demands at the time of next instalment in accordance with the ordinary rules of revenue adminsitration.
('53', 508, 5, 14, 1020710) 6. While the situation in Bardoli is the immediate occasion for these orders,
('53', 508, 6, 15, 1020788) it is intended to apply similar orders to the whole of the districts of Surat, Broach and
('53', 508, 7, 16, 1020878) so far as the local circumstances render them applicable.
('53', 509, 0, 1, 1020936) 510 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 509, 1, 2, 1020978) 7. In order to prevent any misunderstanding I am to explain that these orders will not mean that no efforts will be made to collect unauthorized arrears before the date of the first instalment, but such efforts will be confined to the ordinary methods of persuasion.
('53', 509, 1, 3, 1021245) I am also to add that some further inquiries into the means of the defaulters may be necessary for the purpose of distinguishing those arrears which might possibly be suspended from those which should be classed as unauthorized, and His Excellency hopes that any such inquiries will not be misinterpreted.
('53', 509, 2, 4, 1021551) 8. I am to mention here that the sales of attached goods in Jambusar taluka, to which you draw His Excellencys attention, have now been suspended, and that the cases in question will be governed by the general orders now being issued.
('53', 509, 3, 5, 1021786) 9. As regards land revenue collections in the Sirsi and Siddapur talukas, the position was explained to you at the time of your interview, and His Excellency considers that since practically all the revenue in these talukas has already been collected with scarcely any use of the major coercive processes no further action is called for.
('53', 509, 4, 6, 1022124) I am now to refer to some of the more detailed matters which you brought to notice.
('53', 509, 5, 7, 1022208) 10. I am to invite a reference to the last paragraph of my letter to you of the 10th of July, in which the position was explained.
('53', 509, 5, 8, 1022339) The lands in question are Kaze inam lands held for service, and since they had passed into the possession of a person incapable of performing the service for which they were granted, their resumption and regrant to another person was in accordance with the ordinary rules and did not fall within the scope of the Settlement.
('53', 509, 6, 9, 1022664) 11. While, as His Excellency explained to you, it is not the policy of Government to restore all forfeited licences until they are assured that the situation will remain tranquil, orders are in process of being issued authorizing District Magistrates to use their discretion in suitable cases, and the case of Mr. Shroff will no doubt receive fresh consideration under these orders.
('53', 509, 7, 10, 1023047) 12. His Excellency finds that orders have twice been issued for the reinstalment of the former Patel, but on each occasion it has been necessary to cancel the orders on account of the very severe persecution to which the new Patel Fakirbhai Mahomedbhai was subjected by the people of Butwada.
('53', 509, 7, 11, 1023340) His Excellency has before him a number of fully authenticated instances of this persecution, as a result of which the Government have lately sanctioned the retention of Fakirbhai in the patelship for a further period of one year, after which the case will be re examined and decided on a consideration of the villagers conduct during that period.
('53', 509, 7, 12, 1023687) Any act of persecution during the period will be taken as a sign that the village does not intend to abide by the Settlement.
('53', 509, 8, 13, 1023813) 13. It has been ascertained that the enquiry into the conduct of Jehangir Patel
('53', 510, 0, 1, 1023893) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 511
('53', 510, 1, 2, 1023937) has already been taken up by the Mamlatdar on the Ist of August, when two complainants out of five appeared and stated that their witnesses would not come unless summoned.
('53', 510, 1, 3, 1024109) Every facility will be given to any complainants who wish to appear to produce their evidence in open court.
('53', 510, 2, 4, 1024218) 14. The number of Talatis who have not been reinstated in the Kaira district is found to be 11. In 10 of these cases the posts had already been filled and in the remaining case the Talati was not reinstated because he had been dismissed for repeated insubordination.
('53', 510, 2, 5, 1024485) In the Surat District the Talatis who have not been reinstated are 1 in Olpad, 2 in Jalalpur and 2 in Chikhli.
('53', 510, 2, 6, 1024596) The situation in this district is that a number of posts of Talatis are due for reduction in accordance with the recommendations of the Retrenchment Committee of 1922 23 and these posts are gradually being absorbed as vacancies occur.
('53', 510, 2, 7, 1024831) While therefore it may be possible to absorb some of the resigned Talatis in future vacancies, it is not now possible to recreate appointments which have been abolished owing to their superfluity.

('53', 511, 16, 20, 1027043) 1. As a result of the coversations between His Excellency the Viceroy and Mr. Gandhi, the Congress will now be represented by Mr. Gandhi at the Round Table Conference.
('53', 511, 17, 21, 1027211) 2. The Settlement of March 5, 1931, remains operative.
('53', 511, 17, 22, 1027266) The Government of
('53', 511, 18, 23, 1027284) India and local Governments will secure the observance of the specific provisions of
('53', 511, 19, 24, 1027369) the Settlement in those cases, if any, in which a breach is established, and will give
('53', 511, 20, 25, 1027456) their careful consideration to any representation that may be made in this respect.
('53', 511, 21, 26, 1027540) Congress will fulfil their obligations under the settlement.
('53', 511, 22, 27, 1027601) 3. In regard to collections of land revenue in the Surat district, the point in issue is whether in those villages of Bardoli taluka and Valod Mahal which were visited by revenue officials accompanied by a party of police during the month of July 1931, more severe demands, having regard to their material circumstances, were made from revenue payers and enforced by coercion exercised through the police than were made from and met by revenue payers of other villages of the Bardoli taluka.
('53', 511, 22, 28, 1028093) The Government of India in consultation and full agreement with the Government of Bombay have decided, that an enquiry shall be held into this issue in accordance with the following terms of reference: To enquire into the allegations that Khatedars in

('53', 512, 1, 2, 1028553) the villages in question were compelled by means of coercion exercised through the police to pay revenue in excess of what would have been n demanded if the standard had been applied which was adopted in other villages of the Bardoli taluka where collections were effected after March 5, 1931, without the assistance of the police, and to ascertain what sum, if any, was so paid. Within the terms of reference, evidence may be produced on any matter in dispute.
('53', 512, 1, 3, 1029015) The Government of Bombay have appointed Mr. R. G. Gordon, I.C.S., Collector of Nasik, to hold the enquiry.
('53', 512, 2, 4, 1029122) 4. In regard to other matters hitherto raised by the Congress the Government of India and the local Governments concerned are not prepared to order any enquiry.
('53', 512, 3, 5, 1029283) 5. In regard to any further matters of complaint by the Congress not coming within the specific provisions of the Settlement, such complaints will be dealt with in accordance with the ordinary administrative procedure and practice, and if any question of an enquiry arises, the decision as to whether an enquiry shall be held and if so the form it shall take will be made by the local Government concerned in accordance with such procedure and practice.

('53', 512, 6, 8, 1029829) EDGEWORTH, September 27, 1931
('53', 512, 7, 9, 1029859) T. D. BARLOW: The discussions were frank and friendly on both sides.
('53', 512, 7, 10, 1029928) Mr. Gandhis main point was that 90 per cent of the population of India was dependent on agriculture, and had no work during six months of the year.The khaddar movement therefore has great social significance.
('53', 512, 7, 11, 1030137) Mr. Gandhi has chosen homespinning because it does not involve heavy capital expenditure, and can be widely spread.
('53', 512, 8, 12, 1030253) Mr. Gandhi, I presume, would accept any alternative craft that would provide what he is seeking to achieve, the enlargement and betterment of preasant life, but so far he has not been able to find any effective substitute or competitor.
('53', 512, 8, 13, 1030490) It is therefore impossible for him to abandon the homespinning movement.
('53', 512, 9, 14, 1030563) Mr. Gandhi denied that this movement was specifically directed against English cloth, and said it was firmly understood that when the Pact with Lord Irwin was signed on March 5, the economic boycott remained.
('53', 512, 9, 15, 1030772) He further maintained that it was the economic condition of the world, and above all the lowness of commodity

('53', 513, 1, 2, 1030981) prices, which was responsible for the poor demand for goods far more than the boycott.
('53', 513, 1, 3, 1031068) Mr. Gandhi also said that if what he considered proper and the necessary arrangement between Great Britain and India were established, he fully believed it would be possible to make arrangements whereby a considerable quantity of English cloth would be imported to India, but he could hold out no hope that the Lancashire trade could regain its former magnitude.
('53', 513, 2, 4, 1031431) Mr. Gandhi said that 100,000 women spinners and 10,000 men weavers were active on the homespinning movement and the villages showed marked signs of economic improvement.
('53', 513, 2, 5, 1031601) He said that the British owned mills were on the whole better than indigenous mills, but that some of the letter were as good or better than anything in the world.
('53', 513, 2, 6, 1031765) He expressed himself as astonished at the comfort and housing of Lancashire work people as had seen it, I hope the frank and courteous atmosphere that prevailed in the discussion will provide a favourable atmosphere for official conversations.
('53', 513, 2, 7, 1032009) If satisfactory arrangement is made at the Round Table Conference, it should be much easier to devise something to minimize to the greatest degree the hardship of Lancashire.
('53', 513, 3, 8, 1032184) JOHN GREY: Mr. Gandhi gave us at some length his economic policy, which is directed to the regeneration of village life in India, and stressed the urgent necessity of finding the villagers some alternative to six months idleness which would at the same time be remunerative.
('53', 513, 3, 9, 1032459) It is not as an industry that he regards khaddar as being important, but primarily as an opportunity for work and to supplement earnings.
('53', 513, 3, 10, 1032597) But he realizes that for a long time India will not be self sufficing and will need foreign cloth, and he assured us that if India gets that measure of independence that he is seeking for her he is prepared to do all he can to promote the co operation of India and Great Britain as two friendly States, and would go a long way toward granting us some kind of preference.
('53', 513, 3, 11, 1032968) There is one fear uppermost in my mind, and I ventured very respectully to submit it to Mr. Gandhi.
('53', 513, 3, 12, 1033068) He has united all sorts and kinds of people, different classes, different races, different creeds, under him in a crusade of independence.
('53', 513, 3, 13, 1033207) But supposing that object to be attained, will his power be anything like so great as it is now?
('53', 513, 3, 14, 1033304) I think independence is the cement that is binding his followers together, and I think the cement might come unstuck.
('53', 513, 3, 15, 1033422) Mr. Gandhi does not, I suggest, appreciate fully the power underlying mechanical industry or the singleness of purpose there is about commercial rapacity.
('53', 513, 3, 16, 1033577) His answer was that the villages, once granted universal suffrage, would vote as units, and could govern and control the commercial elements.
('53', 513, 3, 17, 1033719) But I think he was troubled by this question.
('53', 513, 3, 18, 1033765) While he was having his tea of fruit and vegetables, after the meeting was over, I had another talk with him, and we got on to the question of poverty.
('53', 513, 3, 19, 1033917) He spoke of the villages full of emasculated skeletons and I agreed that there could be no outward comparison between poverty in India and poverty in Lancashire.
('53', 514, 0, 1, 1034079) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 515
('53', 514, 1, 2, 1034123) But I said, it is a question of degree.
('53', 514, 1, 3, 1034163) Poverty can be just as real here in its pain and its burden, as it is in India.
('53', 514, 1, 4, 1034243) It all depends on what one was accustomed to.
('53', 514, 1, 5, 1034289) I told him that the poverty went much deeper than he could see in a superficial visit, and that there was in Darwen, Black burn, and Great Harwood especially a concentrated dark blot of unemployment and misery which was directly attributable to the lack of Indian demand.
('53', 514, 1, 6, 1034561) Mr. Gandhi quoted figures and facts to prove, and he did it effectively, that the poverty is due to world causes as well as to the Indian boycott, but I replied that the effect of the Indian boycott was worse both in itself and its repercussions because it was concentrated intensively in one industrial area, rather than throughout the industry as a whole.
('53', 514, 1, 7, 1034919) Mr. Gandhi appreciated this point, and his attitude was a very sympathetic one.
('53', 514, 1, 8, 1034999) I am sure he is a humane man, but his humanity is first and foremost for the Indian people.
('53', 514, 1, 9, 1035091) He repudiates the idea that he is a politician seeking power, and his repudiation impressed us.
('53', 514, 2, 10, 1035187) His appearance as he sat like a Chinese ivory of Buddha awaiting our entrance was pleasing and impressive.
('53', 514, 2, 11, 1035294) He has well shaped head, which is not bald, as his pictures seem to show, but covered with close cropped grey hair.
('53', 514, 2, 12, 1035410) His expression and manner are attractive.
('53', 514, 3, 13, 1035452) JOHN LEE: We never anticipated that our meeting with Mr. Gandhi would give us any immediate hope.
('53', 514, 3, 14, 1035550) We did not expect that he would tell us he was willing to lift the boycott or give us a preference over Indian mills, but we still thought he might give some assurance for the future if the Round Table Conference should be a success.
('53', 514, 3, 15, 1035784) That, in a measure, he did, but emphasized that we should still have to face the native khaddar and a preference to Indian mills so long as the khaddar was not complete.
('53', 514, 3, 16, 1035954) He was at pains to assure us that the boycott was purely an economic and not a political one.
('53', 514, 3, 17, 1036048) But, frankly, we feel that the line that can be drawn between the one and the other, between political and economic, is a very fine one.
('53', 514, 3, 18, 1036185) One question which was put to him was: What influence can Congress use, and what has it done already, in the interests of the natives in the mills, with regard to their working conditions and their wages? He told us in reply of improvements which had already been effected, and assured us that Congress would continue in its work of amelioration.
('53', 514, 3, 19, 1036532) We all felt that from the idealistic point of view we could not quarrel with Mr. Gandhi.
('53', 514, 3, 20, 1036621) I myself said to one of my colleagues, If I were an Indian, I should be a disciple of Gandhi. Of course, in so far as he wants to get back to crude methods of production, either in agriculture or in yearn, we are puzzled.
('53', 514, 3, 21, 1036843) Mr Gandhi himself was spinning while we were there.
('53', 514, 3, 22, 1036895) He told us he always does an hour a day.
('53', 514, 3, 23, 1036936) But even though his machine is an improvement on the old hand spinning wheel, it is still very slow and very crude.
('53', 514, 3, 24, 1037052) We welcomed his assurance that he would be willing to see a preference on Lancashire goods if all his aspirations of independence are fulfilled, and noted that this applied not only to Lancashire but to British goods as a whole.
('53', 514, 3, 25, 1037281) He specifically
('53', 515, 0, 1, 1037297) 516 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('53', 515, 1, 2, 1037339) mentioned other classes of goods.
('53', 515, 1, 3, 1037373) There is perhaps one direction in which one may be justified in some optimism.
('53', 515, 1, 4, 1037452) Perhaps when the education which Mr. Gandhi desires has come to the villages he will not be satisfied with his crude way of providing clothes for himself and will want to turn his energies elsewhere.
('53', 515, 1, 5, 1037652) So that in the development of the Indian Villager there might lie hope for us.
('53', 515, 2, 6, 1037731) ANDREW NAESMITH: Whatever people think of Gandhi and his policy one thing is obvious.
('53', 515, 2, 7, 1037817) He possesses personality and magnetism.
('53', 515, 2, 8, 1037857) It is astounding to reflect that an individual with such a frail body and no imposing physique can yet command the loyalty, affection, and love of millions of people residing in the villages of India.
('53', 515, 2, 9, 1038058) The thing that struck me most was the sober statement of fact which he recounted to us of the conditions in the villages out there the social life of India, and his own relationship to it.
('53', 515, 2, 10, 1038247) He spoke without gesture and in well modulated tones.
('53', 515, 2, 11, 1038301) The only feeling he displayed was in the inflection of the voice.
('53', 515, 2, 12, 1038367) I got the impression that this man really believes he is the chosen vessel of God to lift the wide standard of life in India by the policies, he is enunciating of non violence, truth, and love.
('53', 515, 2, 13, 1038561) He was frank enough to say in our protracted conversations that he recognized to the full the fearful consequences of his policy and that of the Congress Party on the industrial and economic life of Lancashire.
('53', 515, 2, 14, 1038772) However, when he contrasts the social conditions of our people with those of his he still believes it is his divine mission to proceed with his task.
('53', 515, 2, 15, 1038922) I do not think that Gandhi will vary his purposes because of what he has seen in Lancashire and learnt from us.
('53', 515, 2, 16, 1039034) And so I cannot see any possible hope of Lancashires ever doing the same amount of trade with India in textile goods.
('53', 515, 3, 17, 1039152) If his economic policy and political principles are sound and are eventually realized, it seems to me that fully 40 per cent of the spindles and looms in Lancashire will never run again.
('53', 515, 3, 18, 1039339) One has considerable sympathy with the salvation of village life in India.
('53', 515, 3, 19, 1039414) At the same time, when one realizes all that it means to Lancashire one is filled with apprehension for the future.
('53', 515, 3, 20, 1039530) Suppose, we said, there is a conflict in the future between the hand weavers and the Bombay mills.
('53', 515, 3, 21, 1039629) Qutie quietly, without bombast, he replied, I can break the Bombay mills, if need be, and we knew from his tones he believed he could.
('53', 515, 4, 22, 1039764) F. HINDLE: I had met Mr. Gandhi before, in 1926, when I went to India with Mr. Tom Shaw and others in the Trade Delegation.
('53', 515, 4, 23, 1039888) Mr. Gandhi was very candid on Saturday, but, despite the fact that he was meeting with British business men who had felt the effects of his policy very keenly and were determined to put their point of view, there was no bitterness and the interview was a pleasant one.
('53', 515, 4, 24, 1040157) All the same, I think it has brought home to us the fact that we cannot hope for the same volume of trade with India again.
('53', 515, 4, 25, 1040281) I dont like saying that, but we must face facts sometimes.
('53', 515, 4, 26, 1040340) Do I think his visit has done good?
('53', 515, 4, 27, 1040376) Well, yes, it has brought enlightenment, but it is
('53', 516, 0, 1, 1040427) VOL. 53 : 2 JULY, 1931 12 OCTOBER, 1931 517
('53', 516, 1, 2, 1040471) enlightenment without hope.
('53', 516, 2, 3, 1040499) FRED MILLS: After meeting Mr. Gandhi I am convinced that he is very sincere, and that he means what he says when he denies that he has any animosity towards Lancashire.
('53', 516, 2, 4, 1040668) The boycott he declares to be purely an economic weapon and will persist even if his aspirations in respect of independence are conceded.
('53', 516, 2, 5, 1040806) I think it is very important that he sees no reason why a preference once the villages have produced to their fullest extent [sic].
('53', 516, 3, 6, 1040938) The question of poverty is a difficult one.
('53', 516, 3, 7, 1040982) We put it to him that in the East a lower standard of life is the normal thing, and he agreed, but said that there were many millions in India who were below the lowest standard possible even in the Orient.
('53', 516, 3, 8, 1041189) There may be those who think Mr. Gandhi poses, but I am not one of them.
('53', 516, 3, 9, 1041262) He is one of the most remrakable men I have ever met, and disarms criticism by his very pleasing manner.
('53', 516, 3, 10, 1041367) He told us we liked, but the whole discussion was carried on in the greatest good temper.
('53', 516, 3, 11, 1041457) All our question he answered very fully and with perfect good humour.
('53', 516, 3, 12, 1041527) He paid a high tribute to his reception from everyone in Lancashire, and said he was surprised to find even the legitimate irritation towards himself which he had expected had not been shown.
('53', 516, 4, 13, 1041719) T. ASHURST: I do not think we have progressed very much.
('53', 516, 4, 14, 1041776) Mr. Gandhi has made it clear that only if he is satisfied will he do anything to help us, and even that depends on his wants at home being satisfied.
('53', 516, 4, 15, 1041926) We found it was very difficult to separate the economic and political issues, more difficult than Mr. Gandhi seems to find it.
('53', 516, 4, 16, 1042053) The point arises whether Mr. Gandhi can control the mill owners in his own country, and whether at some time in the future they will not be able to flood the villages with their machine made cloth.
('53', 516, 4, 17, 1042251) Still, I think it was good thing for us to meet Mr. Gandhi, and we found him personally very likeable.
