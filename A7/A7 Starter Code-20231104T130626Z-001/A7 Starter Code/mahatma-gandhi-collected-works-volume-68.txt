('68', 0, 2, 3, 68) Unrevised WARDHA,
('68', 0, 3, 4, 86) September 23, 1935
('68', 0, 4, 5, 105) MY DEAR AMRIT,
('68', 0, 5, 6, 120) Your letter to Choudhury has told.
('68', 0, 5, 7, 155) He has taken it in the right spirit.
('68', 0, 5, 8, 192) There was no occasion for apology.
('68', 0, 5, 9, 227) And if you cannot call a spade a spade to your own people in your own home, which Maganwadi is, where could you do so?
('68', 0, 5, 10, 346) You must repeat the performance, whenever the occasion arises.
('68', 0, 5, 11, 409) This size is especially prepared for you.
('68', 0, 5, 12, 451) But you will give me your criticism on it.
('68', 0, 5, 13, 494) For the stinking lot you have to pay nothing.
('68', 0, 5, 14, 540) Has the stink gone with exposure to the sun and the air?
('68', 0, 6, 15, 597) Puri should send his detailed criticism without delay.
('68', 0, 6, 16, 652) He must not wait for the time when he comes here.
('68', 0, 6, 17, 702) I must not be kept in darkness.
('68', 0, 7, 18, 734) I am eating your apples with vengeance.
('68', 0, 7, 19, 774) And I needed them.
('68', 0, 7, 20, 793) They and musambis have acted like medicine.
('68', 0, 8, 21, 837) Mira is free from fever.
('68', 0, 8, 22, 862) But she is still terribly weak and the digestive apparatus does not respond as it should.
('68', 0, 8, 23, 952) In spite of big doses of Enos Fruit Salt, she has to take the enema in order to get a clearance.
('68', 0, 8, 24, 1049) But there is no anxiety on her behalf.
('68', 0, 8, 25, 1088) You wont get full marks as a good nurse, nor Shummy as a good doctor, unless between you two [you] make Pyarelal take milk and your excellent butter.
('68', 0, 8, 26, 1238) Has Shummy anything to add to what I have given 1 in Harijan on snake bites?
('68', 0, 8, 27, 1315) Is there an easy way of distinguishing a poisonous from a non poisonous snake?
('68', 0, 8, 28, 1394) Does he recommend any book on it?
('68', 0, 9, 29, 1428) When does he think Kumarappa can be discharged?
('68', 0, 10, 30, 1476) Here are some letters for your guests 2 (!)

('68', 1, 6, 8, 1853) NARANDAS,
('68', 1, 7, 9, 1863) I can see your tears of joy on your letter.
('68', 1, 7, 10, 1907) If and when I close my eyes in the same condition in which I am today, you may shed more such tears.

('68', 1, 12, 16, 2166) PURUSHOTTAM,
('68', 1, 13, 17, 2179) I have your letter.
('68', 1, 13, 18, 2199) If I didnt know you, I would be displeased to get no letter from you.
('68', 1, 13, 19, 2269) I console myself thinking that you must have some good reason for not writing to me, either that you want to save my time or to save yours.
('68', 1, 13, 20, 2409) According to my nature, I would rather that persons like you wrote to me frequently so that I could know them better and hence could also help.
('68', 1, 13, 21, 2553) I have not yet been able to go through the report of the Harijan work in Kathiawar.
('68', 1, 13, 22, 2637) I do wish to read it.
('68', 1, 13, 23, 2659) What you write about Chhaganlal has disturbed me.
('68', 1, 13, 24, 2709) The Harijan work there must not suffer.
('68', 1, 13, 25, 2749) And we cantt also afford Jivanlal losing interest in it.
('68', 1, 13, 26, 2806) Can you make any suggestion?
('68', 1, 13, 27, 2835) After your letter, it is not possible for me to keep still and do nothing.
('68', 1, 13, 28, 2910) Can I use the contents of your letter in writing to

('68', 2, 11, 16, 3597) DEAR SATISBABU, I have gone through your correspondence with Malkani.
('68', 2, 11, 17, 3667) I enclose a copy of my letter to him which speaks for itself.
('68', 2, 11, 18, 3729) About Sharma our letters have crossed each other.
('68', 2, 11, 19, 3779) Biswanath has got to be helped against himself.
('68', 2, 11, 20, 3827) 2 I do not suppose I know him at all but from the correspondence with Annada I have gathered the impression that he is one of your faithful workers.
('68', 2, 11, 21, 3976) But whether he is that or not, he must not be allowed to go astray for want of attention.
('68', 2, 11, 22, 4066) Therefore even if you have to neglect your work a bit and if he would not come alone to me, you should bring him with you.
('68', 2, 11, 23, 4189) That is of course if you think that his being with me is not likely to aggravate his disease.
('68', 2, 11, 24, 4283) This is

('68', 3, 4, 6, 4592) 6. LETTER TO B.G. KHER
('68', 3, 5, 7, 4615) September 24, 1935
('68', 3, 6, 8, 4634) MY DEAR KHER,
('68', 3, 7, 9, 4648) I ought to have written this to you whilst Swami was here, but I simply could not do it and then it escaped me altogether, till I got a reminder from Swami yesterday afternoon.
('68', 3, 7, 10, 4825) I see no contradiction between what Thakkar Bapa has written and what I conveyed to Swami, Harijan Sevek Sangh wont take direct responsibility of owning the property in Pandharpur, but it will provide the majority of trustees and continue to do so, as vacancies occur by any reason whatsoever.
('68', 3, 7, 11, 5119) The idea behind this arrangement is that the Sangh should not undertake any financial responsibility.
('68', 3, 7, 12, 5221) Its burden would be fully discharged when it has appointed trustees who are able to manage property financially and otherwise.
('68', 3, 7, 13, 5348) This proposition was adopted under my advice.
('68', 3, 7, 14, 5394) The Sangh has not sufficient workers to enable it to take charge of properties that are being offered to it.
('68', 3, 7, 15, 5503) This Pandharpur proposition has been entertained because you and Swami are interested in it and because both of you are connected with the donor, who I am sure holds advanced and liberal views on untouchability and other matters and who wholly endorses the Sanghs campaign against untouchability.
('68', 3, 7, 16, 5800) I hope this is sufficiently clear and quite satisfactory from the point of view of the Buva.
('68', 3, 7, 17, 5893) If any further elucidation is required please do not hesitate to write to me.
('68', 3, 7, 18, 5971) I understand from Shri Kavde who was here for two days that the Buva was expected to be somewhere near Wardha during the first week of October.
('68', 3, 7, 19, 6115) If that does happen I would like you to urge him to pass a few days with me at Maganwadi so that I can make his personal acquaintance and understand his desire about the management of the Dharmashala in Pandharpur.
('68', 3, 7, 20, 6330) In view of the conversation I had with Swami and Shri Kavde I would advise that in drawing up the trust deed you give the
('68', 4, 0, 1, 6452) VOL. 68 : 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 5
('68', 4, 1, 2, 6496) trustees full powers of mortgage, alienation, etc., so long as the corpus is used for the exclusive benefit of Harijans.
('68', 4, 1, 3, 6617) I have explained to Swami why I consider the possession of this power by the trustees as a vital part of the deed.

('68', 4, 6, 11, 6870) GOPICHAND,
('68', 4, 7, 12, 6881) I have your letter.
('68', 4, 7, 13, 6901) I am conferring with Shankerlal as to what should be done.
('68', 4, 7, 14, 6960) My own inclination is to hand the charge to Meerut people because they already know the working of the Kashmir Bhandar.
('68', 4, 7, 15, 7080) If that proposition does not commend itself to Shankerlal or to the council, your alternate proposals will be helpful.
('68', 4, 7, 16, 7199) Let us decide upon certain propositions as decisive, namely, that we shall not run any Bhandar at a loss.
('68', 4, 7, 17, 7305) Secondly we shall not make purchases even in the open market for replenishing our stocks if we do not know what wages the workers at those articles have received.
('68', 4, 7, 18, 7468) This applies to the market pattus 1 you have mentioned.
('68', 4, 7, 19, 7524) It is not enough for us to know, that the pattus come within our definition of khadi or swadeshi.

('68', 5, 2, 3, 7849) VALJI, I couldnt write to you because of heavy pressure of work.
('68', 5, 2, 4, 7914) Munshis writing is neither seductive nor obscene.
('68', 5, 2, 5, 7964) I didnt see anything objectionable in his ridicule of brahmacharya.
('68', 5, 2, 6, 8032) I had read nearly the whole of it before writing the Foreword.
('68', 5, 2, 7, 8095) I had liked his effort.
('68', 5, 2, 8, 8119) The fact is that, having come to know Munshi personally, I have developed a partiality for him.
('68', 5, 2, 9, 8215) He has capacity for self sacrifice.
('68', 5, 2, 10, 8251) He seems to be a sincere man.
('68', 5, 2, 11, 8281) This does not mean that I like everything about him.
('68', 5, 2, 12, 8334) But we should regard others in the spirit of ahimsa, that is, with a broad mind.
('68', 5, 2, 13, 8415) In other words, we should judge everybody according to his limitations.
('68', 5, 2, 14, 8487) I hope this answers all your questions.
('68', 5, 2, 15, 8527) I received your article.
('68', 5, 2, 16, 8552) I hope all of you are well.

('68', 5, 6, 20, 8695) [On or after September 24, 1935] 2
('68', 5, 7, 21, 8730) These spurts are no good, if one sleeps away the rest of the year; and now that we have a definite ideal in front of us, viz., the working towards a minimum wage for eight hours work, some of us must try to do eight hours spinning, either single or by several combining together, keeping a regular record of everyones spinning and every
('68', 5, 8, 22, 9067) 1 The message extracted from Weekly Letter by Mahadev Desai who had explained: When some years ago Gandhiji came to know about the public celebration of his birthday, he said: Let the day be consecrated to spinning for Daridranarayana. And ever since, the celebrations have taken the form of some kind of khadi work.
('68', 5, 8, 23, 9384) This year the Hindu [Vikram era] date was separated from the Christian date by nine days and people devoted the whole time to extra spinning or selling khadi or making khadi collections.
('68', 5, 8, 24, 9571) As the 24th of September (birthday according to the Hindu year) coincided with the Harijan Day, in many parts of India effort was made to do some special acts of service for the Harijans .
('68', 5, 8, 25, 9760) Several places, including our own, had 16 hours unbroken spinning on wheel for the whole period.
('68', 5, 8, 26, 9857) But this was far from satisfying Gandhiji .

('68', 6, 1, 2, 9945) days spinning, so that one can arrive at a standard average spinning .
('68', 6, 1, 3, 10016) I understand the depth of feeling behind your wishing many returns of my birthday.
('68', 6, 1, 4, 10099) But as you know well, not a minute will be added by the Creator to the allotted span of my life, no matter what human effort is put forth.

('68', 6, 9, 15, 10697) September 25, 1935
('68', 6, 10, 16, 10716) CHHAGANLAL,
('68', 6, 11, 17, 10728) I got your letter.
('68', 6, 11, 18, 10747) Reading about the things that Balvantrai has tolerated doesnt lessen my grief.
('68', 6, 11, 19, 10826) Please tell him so, or convey it in a letter, if you have shown him my previous letter.
('68', 6, 11, 20, 10914) The news that the houses of Bhangis were satisfactorily completed though after much delay, was welcome.
('68', 6, 11, 21, 11018) Can you not, with the help of Dakshinamurti, find somebody in Bhavnagar who would take up debt relief work among Bhangis?
('68', 6, 11, 22, 11140) Valjis nephew Rasik is studying in Shamaldas College.
('68', 6, 11, 23, 11194) College students are often found doing silent social work while studying.
('68', 6, 11, 24, 11268) See if you can tempt Rasik.
('68', 6, 11, 25, 11296) If he comes forward, he may also be able to draw his friends into the work.
('68', 6, 11, 26, 11372) The fact that 15 maunds of bones did not give even a basketful of manure means that they were heated more than necessary.
('68', 6, 11, 27, 11494) The bones should merely be charred, that is, heated till
('68', 7, 0, 1, 11551) 8 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('68', 7, 1, 2, 11591) they turn black.
('68', 7, 1, 3, 11608) They should be heated less than wood is when it is turned into charcoal.
('68', 7, 1, 4, 11681) There will then be hardly any loss of weight in the bones.
('68', 7, 1, 5, 11740) I performed the process myself and produced manure.
('68', 7, 1, 6, 11792) The experiment was demonstrated in Maganwadi.
('68', 7, 1, 7, 11838) The method is now frequently made use of in Nalvadi.
('68', 7, 1, 8, 11891) The fuel consists of dried stumps of uprooted hedge plants.
('68', 7, 1, 9, 11951) Wood should not be used for the purpose, and dry sticks not at all.
('68', 7, 1, 10, 12019) The material used for fuel should be such as would burn just a little longer than hay, so that when it is burnt up it will leave the bones unburnt.
('68', 7, 1, 11, 12167) It should be remembered that our aim is not even to heat the bones till they look like charcoal.
('68', 7, 1, 12, 12264) Charring bones means merely heating them till they turn black.
('68', 7, 1, 13, 12327) We have to go just a little further than smoking them.
('68', 7, 1, 14, 12382) Bones heated in this manner lose nothing besides a little nitrogen, and certainly no phosphorus.
('68', 7, 1, 15, 12479) If the phosphorus in bones is lost, their essence is lost.
('68', 7, 1, 16, 12538) Collect a few bones and make the experiment yourself several times till you have mastered the process.
('68', 7, 1, 17, 12641) Did you by any chance try to heat the 15 maunds of bones together at one time?
('68', 7, 1, 18, 12720) More and more bone mills and flour mills will continue to come up and people will go in for their products.
('68', 7, 1, 19, 12828) But wouldnt a true brahmachari remain unshaken in his vow even in the midst of widespread immorality?
('68', 7, 1, 20, 12930) Going further than that, dont we see that, though the threat of death hangs over everybody, the whole world strives, and commendably, to stave off the evil day?
('68', 7, 1, 21, 13091) If in the same way we regard it our duty to do our best, we would go on doing our work fearlessly and with faith and a cheerful mind no matter how often we fail.
('68', 7, 1, 22, 13253) The success of mills lies in being able to pay dividends, whereas ours lies in doing our duty.
('68', 7, 1, 23, 13348) One who has dedicated himself to a cause doesnt hope for the reward of his work.
('68', 7, 1, 24, 13429) A person who travels to Hardwar in a train does nothing very great, but a pilgrim who travels on foot from Kanyakumari to Jamnotri may be said to have achieved something.
('68', 7, 1, 25, 13600) I say something because after all Jamnotri is only a physical goal.
('68', 7, 1, 26, 13668) Our effort for the revival of village industries belongs to the same class.
('68', 7, 1, 27, 13744) But real effort consists in striving for an invisible goal.
('68', 7, 1, 28, 13804) Despite the coming into vogue of aeroplanes, we shall need our legs.
('68', 7, 1, 29, 13873) Likewise, despite the numerous mills which have sprung up, there will be need for village industries.
('68', 7, 1, 30, 13975) Just as it would be foolish to neglect cultivating strength of limbs because of the increasing use of aeroplanes, so it would be foolish to neglect village industries because
('68', 8, 0, 1, 14150) VOL. 68 : 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 9
('68', 8, 1, 2, 14194) of the multiplication of mills.
('68', 8, 1, 3, 14226) We are trying to save to country from committing such folly.
('68', 8, 1, 4, 14287) There can be no room for despair in such effort.
('68', 8, 1, 5, 14336) The description of the condition of the cultivators in Samdhiyala proves that I am fully justified in giving the first place in our programme to village sanitation.
('68', 8, 1, 6, 14501) Even this first step in mans education has come to be neglected.
('68', 8, 1, 7, 14566) The reason for that neglect is the unforgivable sin of the higher castes in looking down upon the lower castes.
('68', 8, 1, 8, 14678) If Dhiru has gone to Totaramji to learn agriculture or with the noble desire of serving him, my congratulations to him, Rama and you.
('68', 8, 1, 9, 14812) I never think about Harilal now.
('68', 8, 1, 10, 14845) I have already written to you about the result of my inquiry concerning .
('68', 8, 1, 11, 14919) .s 1 character.
('68', 8, 1, 12, 14935) To me his letter seemed to be perfectly sincere.
('68', 8, 1, 13, 14984) It seems he is connected with several institutions in Rajkot.
('68', 8, 1, 14, 15046) He has suggested to me that, if I wish, I might make further inquiries to ascertain the correctness of the facts stated in his letter.
('68', 8, 1, 15, 15181) Narandas has no doubt regarding that, and Bhai Jethalal has produced before me no definite evidence.
('68', 8, 1, 16, 15282) I, therefore, have made no further enquiry.
('68', 8, 1, 17, 15326) However, I am prepared to do so if you produce definite evidence.
('68', 8, 1, 18, 15392) I have still kept that door open for you.
('68', 8, 1, 19, 15434) Personally, I have no bias either way in the matter.
('68', 8, 1, 20, 15487) My condition is like that of a judge who changes his view from time to time as more and more evidence for or against is brought forward.
('68', 8, 1, 21, 15624) I have sent Narandass letter to Jethalal Joshi.
('68', 8, 1, 22, 15672) Please tell him that he has not even acknowledged it, and, if he has not received my letter, inform me accordingly.
('68', 8, 1, 23, 15788) I havent even kept a copy of Narandass letter.
('68', 8, 1, 24, 15835) The date of posting of my letter can be ascertained from my register.
('68', 8, 1, 25, 15905) Jethalal lives in the same house where you live.
('68', 8, 1, 26, 15954) If, therefore, you feel inclined to take up this matter, by all means do so.
('68', 8, 1, 27, 16031) You must have seen from Narandass letter that he does not accept a single charge.
('68', 8, 1, 28, 16113) It should be borne in mind that.
('68', 8, 2, 29, 16146) character or whether or not he habitually wears khadi is not the only subject matter of inquiry.
('68', 8, 2, 30, 16243) It is possible that Narandass attitude on that point is not correct.
('68', 8, 2, 31, 16312) I have not come to any conclusion even about that.

('68', 9, 7, 9, 16701) I am also writing one to Kusum.
('68', 9, 7, 10, 16733) Your purse is being filled up fairly well.
('68', 9, 7, 11, 16776) Some work is being done here under Amtussalaams inspiration.
('68', 9, 7, 12, 16837) One charkha will be kept working for sixteen hours daily till the 2nd.
('68', 9, 7, 13, 16908) Yesterday, it was kept working 24 hours just by chance.
('68', 9, 7, 14, 16964) Kanti started spinning late in the evening and continued till 4.45 a.m.
('68', 9, 7, 15, 17036) He rose at the time of morning prayer, because only he and Mahadev have all the eighteen chapters by heart.
('68', 9, 7, 16, 17144) Kanaiyo cannot but absorb himself in such work and Navin also has done the same.
('68', 9, 7, 17, 17225) It looks as if they really like it all.

('68', 9, 11, 23, 17446) September 25, 1935
('68', 9, 12, 24, 17465) BHAI MUNSHI,
('68', 9, 13, 25, 17478) I add the good wishes of you both to those of many others.
('68', 9, 13, 26, 17537) But isnt it Gods will that prevails in the end?
('68', 9, 13, 27, 17585) Who can thwart the decrees of Fate?
('68', 9, 13, 28, 17621) Have you considered what kind of figure I would cut in the Sahitya Parishad?
('68', 9, 13, 29, 17698) When my name was suggested on a similar occasion years ago, the late Ramanbhai had remarked that I did not know even as much Gujarati as a raw matriculate.
('68', 9, 13, 30, 17854) I had at that time agreed whole heartedly with him when I heard the remark.
('68', 9, 13, 31, 17930) As my era had already commenced then, others who heard that sincerely meant remark had felt hurt, but I saw in it nothing but sincerity of purpose and regard
('68', 10, 0, 1, 18088) VOL. 68 : 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 11
('68', 10, 1, 2, 18133) for propriety.
('68', 10, 1, 3, 18148) Our peoples love is blind.
('68', 10, 1, 4, 18175) They believe that a person who is capable in one field must be so in other fields, too.
('68', 10, 1, 5, 18263) If the person is weak minded, he would therefore soon come to grief.
('68', 10, 1, 6, 18332) Ramanbhais remark made in 1915 16 holds true literally even today, and I am therefore shaking in my shoes ever since my name was suggested for the forthcoming session of the Parishad.
('68', 10, 1, 7, 18516) In cherishing the aspiration to make the Parishad a symbol of Gujarats unity and culture, dont you think you are making its field unlimited?
('68', 10, 1, 8, 18657) And I see no likelihood of that aspiration being realized through my becoming its President.
('68', 10, 1, 9, 18750) This is precisely the state of my mind.
('68', 10, 1, 10, 18790) If even after knowing this all the members desire that I must become the President and if the Parishad is to meet next year, you may give me an opportunity to think again then.
('68', 10, 1, 11, 18967) 1 You have approached me as advocate of the Reception Committee, but now please become my advocate and reply to the Committee on my behalf that you are personally convinced by my argument and agree that I should be spared from having to become President.
('68', 10, 1, 12, 19222) Regarding the Advisory Committee for Hansa, I thought I had said my say.
('68', 10, 1, 13, 19295) 2 But Mahadev gave me your message just now.
('68', 10, 1, 14, 19340) I see that you have enumerated fifteen languages, from out of which you yourself agree to the exclusion of three, leaving twelve.
('68', 10, 1, 15, 19470) Fixing an upper limit of 20 for twelve languages, you may select whatever names you like.
('68', 10, 1, 16, 19560) I would find it difficult to make the selection, since I do not know everybody.
('68', 10, 1, 17, 19640) I was concerned only with the size, and if my argument on that point appeals to you, you yourself should select the agreed number of names.
('68', 10, 1, 18, 19780) I will accept your selection.

('68', 11, 2, 3, 20149) AGANWADI, WARDHA, September 26, 1935
('68', 11, 3, 4, 20186) NARAHARI, I got your letter.
('68', 11, 3, 5, 20215) We cannot afford to give way to despair in this manner.
('68', 11, 3, 6, 20271) I cant explain much in a letter.
('68', 11, 3, 7, 20304) Find some time after Parikshitlal returns and come over for a while.
('68', 11, 3, 8, 20373) It is true that we are not able to give the girls as much as we ought to.
('68', 11, 3, 9, 20447) But it is also true that we do not have the necessary women workers.
('68', 11, 3, 10, 20516) God creates difficulties so that we might overcome them and not run away from them.
('68', 11, 3, 11, 20600) You acted rightly in relieving Bhagwanji.
('68', 11, 3, 12, 20642) Puratan may go to a village if he wishes.
('68', 11, 3, 13, 20684) We may certainly introduce any reforms that you desire and others also that we can think of.
('68', 11, 3, 14, 20777) While doing so we should bear only one thing in mind.
('68', 11, 3, 15, 20831) namely, that we must not abandon anything we have started so long as we see no immorality in it.
('68', 11, 3, 16, 20928) Think over this while you are waiting to come here.
('68', 11, 3, 17, 20980) Can Anasuyabehn take charge of the younger girls who give you trouble?
('68', 11, 3, 18, 21051) If she is short of space, can she shift her Bal Mandir to the Harijan Ashram?
('68', 11, 3, 19, 21129) You can do the tanning and the dairy work even there.
('68', 11, 3, 20, 21183) Where else will you get the facilities of land, etc., which you have there?
('68', 11, 3, 21, 21259) Valunjkar has been doing his work here so efficiently and intelligently that I am hopeful that he will soon be able to run tanneries at a number of places.
('68', 11, 3, 22, 21415) He has even undertaken to start one at Nasik.
('68', 11, 3, 23, 21461) A building is already under construction there and the work will start as soon as it is completed.
('68', 11, 3, 24, 21560) You will see that, too, when you come here.
('68', 11, 3, 25, 21604) Valunjkar has resolved to suffer no loss from the very beginning and all kinds of schemes are being thought out with that end in view.
('68', 11, 3, 26, 21739) I think from the economic point of view the work here will be more successful than Satisbabus project.
('68', 11, 3, 27, 21842) The latter has already consumed a lot of money by now.
('68', 11, 3, 28, 21897) The return has yet to come.
('68', 11, 3, 29, 21925) In Valunjkars project very little money has been invested, the hides are being tanned, there is a sufficient number of cobblers for the work and the trainees, too, are making progress.
('68', 11, 3, 30, 22110) Please remember that a servant of the people must display all the four qualities in proper balance, namely, the Brahmins wisdom, the Kshatriyas fearlessness, the Vaishyas purity of management and the

('68', 12, 1, 2, 22355) Shudras capacity for untiring labour.
('68', 12, 1, 3, 22393) The greatest shortcoming in us all is the lack of the Kshatriya spirit.
('68', 12, 1, 4, 22465) We lose heart much too soon.
('68', 12, 1, 5, 22494) We tremble to stand alone.
('68', 12, 1, 6, 22521) At sight of the tiger of difficulties, whether we are one or many we start running away.
('68', 12, 1, 7, 22610) Please do not think that any of these charges is directed against you alone.
('68', 12, 1, 8, 22687) I am explaining to you what I see all around me and even in myself.
('68', 12, 1, 9, 22755) As for myself, where can I run away to?
('68', 12, 1, 10, 22795) My condition, therefore, is like that of a Bania who had got himself tied on the back of a horse.
('68', 12, 1, 11, 22893) If you have not heard this story, please ask me some time.
('68', 12, 1, 12, 22952) I will enjoy telling it to you or, if you cannot come in the near future, will write to you.

('68', 13, 2, 3, 24114) MAGANWADI, WARDHA, September 27, 1935
('68', 13, 3, 4, 24152) RASIK, I have not preserved your letter, but the language was so clumsy that I had to read it twice to take in its meaning.
('68', 13, 3, 5, 24276) It is natural that you two couldnt have any such meaning in your minds, but the letter did mean that you certainly wanted your money to be used for relief work but that I should send you an account showing the particulars of individuals to whom it was paid.
('68', 13, 3, 6, 24534) If Kanti has written to you and said that the money received by me was not being used, he is not right.
('68', 13, 3, 7, 24638) It is true that some funds that are lying with me are not being used as yet, but if Kanti did write what you think he did, you ought not to have sent me at all the money for Quetta relief work.
('68', 13, 3, 8, 24832) If, however, you felt it your dharma to send it, you should have quoted Kantiswords and told me that your money should be spent immediately and should not lie with me unused.
('68', 13, 3, 9, 25007) I hope you will see that your error in writing in English was still more serious.
('68', 13, 3, 10, 25089) I was surprised to discover that, after having lived with me for so many years, you have not been able to understand and see that, however well one may know the English language, one should write or speak in it only when absolutely necessary.
('68', 13, 3, 11, 25332) Since there was no incivility anywhere in your letter, you need not have apologized for it.
('68', 13, 3, 12, 25424) If, however, you lose all that you have learnt in the Ashram, then will be the time for you to apologize.

('68', 14, 1, 3, 25955) It should be so well packed that there would be no danger of leakage.
('68', 14, 1, 4, 26025) If you cannot procure really good ghee, you should stop sending any.
('68', 14, 1, 5, 26094) One of our men should go to the people who prepare the ghee and teach them how to make it and see that they pack only properly boiled ghee and use clean tins.
('68', 14, 1, 6, 26253) It requires great art to boil the ghee properly.
('68', 14, 1, 7, 26302) Dont mind having sent the last sample, I will examine it and let you know.

('68', 15, 7, 15, 28415) You must have received my letter to Mathew.
('68', 15, 7, 16, 28459) A spinning wheel is kept going here continuously for 16 hours.

('68', 15, 11, 21, 28657) The foregoing notice 1 hardly needs any recommendation from me.
('68', 15, 11, 22, 28721) The solid work done by the institution must be its own recommendation.
('68', 15, 11, 23, 28792) The people of the South should prove their appreciation by giving it adequate financial support.

('68', 15, 13, 26, 29154) in order to convey the message of Hindi to every home in South India and also to collect funds .
('68', 15, 13, 27, 29251)  The Council had also desired to enlist as many new members as possible to the Sabha during the Week.

('68', 16, 1, 2, 29398) 21. ABOUT CONVERSION
('68', 16, 2, 3, 29419) Mr. A. A. Paul of the Federation of International Fellowships asked me the other day to define in these columns my position on conversion.
('68', 16, 2, 4, 29558) I told him to frame definite questions on which he would like my answers.
('68', 16, 2, 5, 29632) The result was the following letter with a list of propositions attached:
('68', 16, 3, 6, 29706) You remember that a little over a month ago, I wrote to you asking you whether you would publish a statement giving your views on conversion.You wrote back to say that it would be easier for you if we could put them in the form of questions or assertions.
('68', 16, 3, 7, 29962) At the request of the Executive Committee of the Madras International Fellowship, one of our Christian members has prepared the enclosed statement and the Committee has asked me to pass it on to you with the request that you will kindly find it possible to answer these statements in Harijan.
('68', 16, 3, 8, 30255) Of course you will notice that the questions are framed from the Christian point of view; but the Committee feels that the questions will apply equally well to other Missionary Religions which are engaged in conversion programme.
('68', 16, 3, 9, 30485) May I hope that you will find it possible to explain your attitude to these questions?
('68', 16, 4, 10, 30572) PROPOSITIONS
('68', 16, 5, 11, 30585) 1. Conversion is a change of heart from sin to God.
('68', 16, 5, 12, 30637) It is the work of God.
('68', 16, 5, 13, 30660) Sin is separation from God.
('68', 16, 6, 14, 30688) 2. The Christian believes that Jesus is the fulfilment of Gods revelation to mankind, that He is our Saviour from sin, that He alone can bring the sinner to God and thus enable him to live.
('68', 16, 7, 15, 30878) 3. The Christian, to whom God has become a living reality and power through Christ, regards it as his privilege and duty to speak about Jesus and to proclaim the free offer which He came on earth to make.
('68', 16, 8, 16, 31083) 4. If any mans heart is so moved by the hearing of this message as to repent and wish to live a new life as a disciple of Jesus, the Christian regards it as right to admit him to the company of His professed believers which is called the Christian Church.
('68', 16, 9, 17, 31339) 5. The Christian shall do all in his power to sound the sincerity of conviction in all such cases and shall point out, as he can, the consequences of such a step, stressing the duty a man owes to his family.
('68', 17, 0, 1, 31547) 18 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('68', 17, 1, 2, 31588) 6. The Christian shall do everything in his power to prevent any motives of self seeking on his part and of material considerations on the part of the convert.
('68', 17, 2, 3, 31748) 7. Inasmuch as Jesus came to give full life, and that as a matter of history conversion has often meant an enhancing of personality, the Christian shall not be accused of using material inducements if conversion results in the social uplift of the convertit always being understood that such shall never be used as a means to an end.
('68', 17, 3, 4, 32082) 8. The Christian is right in accepting as his duty the care of the sincere convertbody, soul and mind.
('68', 17, 4, 5, 32185) 9. It shall not be brought against the Christian that he is using material inducements, when certain facts in Hindu social theory, out of his control, are in themselves an inducement to the Harijan.
('68', 17, 4, 6, 32384) (But see points 5 and 6.) In order to understand the background to these propositions, the reader should know that the origin of the main question was a discussion I was carrying on with Mr. A. A. Paul on the so called mass conversion of a village predominantly or wholly composed of Harijans.
('68', 17, 4, 7, 32678) The reader may later on read more of this conversion.
('68', 17, 4, 8, 32732) For the present purpose it is enough that he understands, that it is the method of mass conversion that has to be tested in the light of these propositions.
('68', 17, 4, 9, 32889) Indeed the ninth proposition almost says as much.
('68', 17, 4, 10, 32939) I have read the propositions several times, and the more I read them the more I feel that they can be applied only to individual contacts, never to the mass of mankind.
('68', 17, 4, 11, 33108) Take the very first proposition.
('68', 17, 4, 12, 33141) Sin is defined to be separation from God.
('68', 17, 4, 13, 33183) Conversion is a change of heart from sin to God.
('68', 17, 4, 14, 33232) It is the work of God. So says the author of the propositions.
('68', 17, 4, 15, 33295) If conversion is the work of God, why should that work be taken away from Him?
('68', 17, 4, 16, 33374) And who is man to take away anything from God?
('68', 17, 4, 17, 33421) He may become a humble instrument in the hands of God.
('68', 17, 4, 18, 33476) Even so he cannot be a judge of mens hearts.
('68', 17, 4, 19, 33521) I often wonder whether we are always true judges of our own hearts.
('68', 17, 4, 20, 33589) Man, know thyself must have been wrung out of a desparate heart.
('68', 17, 4, 21, 33654) And if we know so little of ourselves, how much less must we know of our neighbours and remote strangers who may differ from us in a multitude of things, some of which are of the highest moment?
('68', 17, 4, 22, 33849) The second proposition deals with the Christian belief handed to the believer from generation to generation, the truth of which thousands of Christians born are never called upon to test for themselves, and rightly not.
('68', 17, 4, 23, 34069) Surely it is a dangerous thing to present it
('68', 18, 0, 1, 34114) VOL. 68 : 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 19
('68', 18, 1, 2, 34159) to those who have been brought up to a different belief.
('68', 18, 1, 3, 34216) And it would appear to me to be impertinent on my part to present my untested belief to the professor of another which for aught I know may be as true as mine.
('68', 18, 1, 4, 34376) It is highly likely that mine may be good enough for me and his for him.
('68', 18, 1, 5, 34449) A thick woollen coat would be the thing for one living in the cold region of the earth, as a piece of loincloth for another living near the equatorial regions.
('68', 18, 1, 6, 34609) The third proposition too, like the first, relates to the mysteries of religion which are not understood by the common people who take them in faith.
('68', 18, 1, 7, 34759) They work well enough among people living in the traditional faith.
('68', 18, 1, 8, 34827) They will repel those who have been brought up to believe something else.
('68', 18, 1, 9, 34901) The other five propositions deal with the conduct of the missionary among those whom he is seeking to convert.
('68', 18, 1, 10, 35012) They seemto me to be almost impossible of application in practice.
('68', 18, 1, 11, 35079) The start being wrong, all that follows must be necessarily so.
('68', 18, 1, 12, 35143) Thus how is the Christian to sound the sincerity of the conviction of his hearers?
('68', 18, 1, 13, 35226) By a show of hands?
('68', 18, 1, 14, 35246) By personal conversation?
('68', 18, 1, 15, 35272) By a temporary trial?
('68', 18, 1, 16, 35294) Any test that can be conceived will fail even to be reasonably conclusive.
('68', 18, 1, 17, 35369) No one but God knows a mans heart.
('68', 18, 1, 18, 35404) Is the Christian so sure of his being so right in body, mind and soul as to feel comfortably right in accepting as his duty the care of the sincere convertbody, soul and mind?
('68', 18, 1, 19, 35580) The last propositionthe crown of all the preceding ones takes ones breath away.
('68', 18, 1, 20, 35660) For it makes it clear that the other eight are to be applied in all their fulness to the poor Harijans.
('68', 18, 1, 21, 35764) And yet the very first proposition has not ceased to puzzle the brains of some of the most intellectual and philosophical persons even in the present generation.
('68', 18, 1, 22, 35926) Who knows the nature of original sin?
('68', 18, 1, 23, 35964) What is the meaning of separation from God?
('68', 18, 1, 24, 36008) What is that of the union with God?
('68', 18, 1, 25, 36044) What are the signs of him who is united to God?
('68', 18, 1, 26, 36092) Are all who dare to preach the message of Jesus the Christ sure of their union with God?
('68', 18, 1, 27, 36181) If they are not, who will test the Harijans knowledge of these deep things?
('68', 18, 1, 28, 36257) This is my reaction to the foregoing propositions.
('68', 18, 1, 29, 36308) I hope no Christian who reads it will be offended by it.
('68', 18, 1, 30, 36365) I would have been false to my numerous Christian friends, if I had hidden from them my true position on the nine propositions.
('68', 18, 1, 31, 36492) My own detached view may now be stated in a few words.
('68', 19, 0, 1, 36547) 20 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('68', 19, 1, 2, 36588) believe that there is no such thing as conversion from one faith to another in the accepted sense of the term.
('68', 19, 1, 3, 36699) It is a highly personal matter for the individual and his God.
('68', 19, 1, 4, 36762) I may not have any design upon my neighbour as to his faith which I must honour even as I honour my own.
('68', 19, 1, 5, 36867) For I regard all the great religions of the world as true at any rate for the people professing them as mine is true for me.
('68', 19, 1, 6, 36992) Having reverently studied the scriptures of the world, I have no difficulty in perceiving the beauties in all of them.
('68', 19, 1, 7, 37111) I could no more think of asking a Christian or a Mussalman or a Parsi or a Jew to change his faith than I would think of changing my own.
('68', 19, 1, 8, 37249) This makes me no more oblivious of the limitations of the professors of those faiths, than it makes me of the grave limitations of the professors of mine.
('68', 19, 1, 9, 37404) And seeing that it takes all my resources in trying to bring my practice to the level of my faith and in preaching the same to my co religionists, I do not dream of preaching to the followers of other faiths.
('68', 19, 1, 10, 37613) Judge not lest ye be judged is sound maxim for ones conduct.
('68', 19, 1, 11, 37674) It is a conviction daily growing upon me that the greatand rich Christian missions will render true service to India, if they can persuade themselves to confine their activities to humanitarian service without the ulterior motive of converting India or at least her unsophisticated villagers to Christianity, and destroying their social superstructure, which notwithstanding its many defects has stood now from time immemorial the onslaughts upon it from within and from without.
('68', 19, 1, 12, 38154) Whether theythe missionariesand we wish it or not, what is true in the Hindu faith will abide, what is untrue will fall to pieces.
('68', 19, 1, 13, 38285) Every living faith must have within itself the power of rejuvenation if it is to live.

('68', 20, 5, 6, 39264) WARDHA, September 28, 1935
('68', 20, 6, 7, 39291) MY DEAR AMRIT,
('68', 20, 7, 8, 39306) I better dictate this letter.
('68', 20, 7, 9, 39336) These ups and downs in Devdass health do not trouble me at all.
('68', 20, 7, 10, 39400) I know that he is getting on there.
('68', 20, 7, 11, 39436) And I know further that he is in the best of hands.
('68', 20, 7, 12, 39488) Whoever gave the news to Pyarelal did no good turn.
('68', 20, 7, 13, 39540) Really and truly I have never felt better.
('68', 20, 7, 14, 39583) The whole of the last supply of your apples was practically finished by me.
('68', 20, 7, 15, 39659) And I was also taking musumbis.
('68', 20, 7, 16, 39691) Therefore there is no cause for worry, even on that score.
('68', 20, 7, 17, 39750) Whenever I feel the need for fruit I shall certainly take it.
('68', 20, 7, 18, 39812) I have not left off raw leaves.
('68', 20, 7, 19, 39844) There was for a few days no room left for neem leaves.
('68', 20, 7, 20, 39899) So that was omitted.
('68', 20, 7, 21, 39920) But then all the vegetables were to be omitted if I was taking fruit and the fruit jam.
('68', 20, 7, 22, 40008) And now I have gone back to neem leaves.
('68', 20, 7, 23, 40049) The bhaji I have been taking in its cooked form in order to avoid constipation but I stopped it when I was taking apples.
('68', 20, 7, 24, 40171) You will please therefore not worry about my health.
('68', 20, 7, 25, 40224) Now about Ba.
('68', 20, 7, 26, 40238) If she is not happy there and if she can be spared, I think it is no good keeping her there.
('68', 20, 7, 27, 40331) With all your care and attention I am quite sure that Devdas does not need her presence there.
('68', 20, 7, 28, 40426) If, therefore, she feels like coming away to Wardha you should let her do so.
('68', 20, 7, 29, 40504) She is well able to travel by herself.
('68', 20, 7, 30, 40543) She requires some

('68', 21, 1, 3, 40690) That you can arrange without the slightest difficulty at Kalka, Ambala and Delhi.
('68', 21, 1, 4, 40772) Someone has simply to meet her at the station and put her in the right compartment.
('68', 21, 1, 5, 40856) I am looking forward to your letter giving me your own programme.
('68', 21, 1, 6, 40922) I should be very much disturbed if you altered your own programe on account of Devdas or Kumarappa.
('68', 21, 1, 7, 41022) If they cannot stay at Manorville after you leave it, they must shift somewhere else or go to some other hill station, if a more prolonged stay is necessary.
('68', 21, 1, 8, 41180) And I do think that both of them should remain in the bracing climate at least up to the end of October if not November.
('68', 21, 1, 9, 41301) Devdas may even require a longer stay.
('68', 21, 1, 10, 41340) The apples and your letter have just come in.
('68', 21, 1, 11, 41386) If Ba forfeits her ticket, she should pay the fare, i.e., Devdas.

('68', 21, 5, 16, 41570) CHHAGANLAL,
('68', 21, 6, 17, 41582) I got your letter written on Rentia Baras Day.
('68', 21, 6, 18, 41629) It looks very nice indeed that you are taking part in the uninterrupted spinning programme in the national school.
('68', 21, 6, 19, 41744) Thanks to Amtussalaams efforts, here also spinning is going on daily for 16 hours.
('68', 21, 6, 20, 41827) Sixteen persons give one hour each by turn.
('68', 21, 6, 21, 41871) The spinning starts at 5 a.m.
('68', 21, 6, 22, 41901) and goes on up to 9 p.m.
('68', 21, 6, 23, 41926) About 3,500 rounds are spun daily.
('68', 21, 6, 24, 41961) I have suggested some changes in this programme, and my suggestion that one spinning wheel should be kept systematically working day and night is being discussed.
('68', 21, 6, 25, 42124) It seems you have not correctly understood my article 1. I did not give up the practice under pressure from anybody.
('68', 21, 6, 26, 42241) When Morarji and Chandulal came here to express their views, their arguments had no effect on my mind or could not make me give up the practice.
('68', 21, 6, 27, 42386) But when I was faced with the problem of how to save the young man, my attitude changed immediately.
('68', 21, 6, 28, 42487) I have done many things in my life with the motive of saving other persons.
('68', 21, 6, 29, 42563) Nor have I accepted it as a

('68', 22, 1, 2, 42670) principle never to yield to popular sentiments, though I do oppose doing anything merely to respect such sentiments.
('68', 22, 1, 3, 42787) My rule is this: Whenever respecting popular sentiments does not involve violation of moral principles or loss of self respect, they should be respected even at some cost to oneself.
('68', 22, 1, 4, 42970) For instance, if it was not for popular sentiments, I would most probably wear no clothes.
('68', 22, 1, 5, 43061) I would see for myself in such practice many moral benefits besides benefit to my health.
('68', 22, 1, 6, 43151) It would strengthen my self control.
('68', 22, 1, 7, 43188) But out of respect for popular sentiments I refrain from taking this very desirable step.
('68', 22, 1, 8, 43278) I learnt about Jivanlals resignation only from your letter.
('68', 22, 1, 9, 43338) You should have given more details.
('68', 22, 1, 10, 43374) If I am required to decide about it finally any details given by you would have been useful.
('68', 22, 1, 11, 43467) Now I myself will write to you and ask you for information that I might need if the matter comes before me.
('68', 22, 1, 12, 43575) You must have received my previous letter 1.

('68', 22, 7, 20, 43878) That takes more time.
('68', 22, 7, 21, 43900) Besides, your letter calls for immediate reply.
('68', 22, 7, 22, 43948) Do come some time about the 16th.
('68', 22, 7, 23, 43982) By bits I will give you as much time as you need.
('68', 22, 7, 24, 44032) Will it be all right if I do so during my walks?
('68', 22, 7, 25, 44081) It would be better if you do not fix in advance the time of your stay here.

('68', 22, 7, 27, 44223) It would be better to see all the scattered activities at leisure and also if our conversations were spread over.
('68', 22, 7, 28, 44337) Prabhavati has collected the yarn spun by me.
('68', 22, 7, 29, 44383) And I have entrusted its dispatch also to her.
('68', 22, 7, 30, 44430) I read the book about Hitler at your suggestion.
('68', 22, 7, 31, 44479) I read Maxtons book 2 on Lenin, too.
('68', 22, 7, 32, 44516) I also asked them to send me another book on Hitler and I have got it now.

('68', 23, 1, 2, 44757) interesting.
('68', 23, 1, 3, 44770) There are many reasons for people to envy you.
('68', 23, 1, 4, 44817) I am sure that when you know all the circumstances of my renunciation, you also will agree with me.
('68', 23, 1, 5, 44917) Most probably Jamnalalji will return by the 2nd or the 3rd.
('68', 23, 1, 6, 44977) So far as I remember, I had replied to both your questions in my previous letter.
('68', 23, 1, 7, 45059) I see no acknowledgement of that letter in your present letter.
('68', 23, 1, 8, 45123) I, therefore, briefly reply to your questions again.
('68', 23, 1, 9, 45176) There are many objections against approving of compulsory sterilization of people suffering from leprosy.
('68', 23, 1, 10, 45282) The practice is likely to lead to numerous evils.
('68', 23, 1, 11, 45332) It is also not right to assume any disease to be incurable.
('68', 23, 1, 12, 45392) It seems safer to me to propagate the method of self control and be content with whatever results can be achieved in thatway.
('68', 23, 1, 13, 45518) I sense cowardice at every step.
('68', 23, 1, 14, 45551) A spinner who was a coward would cut apart tangled yarn.
('68', 23, 1, 15, 45608) A good spinner, on the other hand, would undo the tangle with patience and skill and keep the thread whole.
('68', 23, 1, 16, 45716) A follower of ahimsa would adopt some such method with persons suffering from supposedly incurable diseases.
('68', 23, 1, 17, 45825) Systematic foreign propaganda by us seems to me to be like a bullock cart competing with a railway train.
('68', 23, 1, 18, 45931) If we can spend a thousand for propaganda in the cause of truth, the adversary is in a position to spend a crore.
('68', 23, 1, 19, 46045) I am, therefore, convinced that we should be satisfied with whatever propaganda takes place in the normal course through the work of individuals.

('68', 23, 6, 24, 46346) Shri K. S. Savant was with me for nearly a week.
('68', 23, 6, 25, 46395) He is a Harijan and sculptor by profession, having gone through the full course in the Bombay School of Art.
('68', 23, 6, 26, 46504) I could not resist his appeal to be allowed to sit in my room and do his work without distracting my attention in any way.
('68', 23, 6, 27, 46627) He had his hearts wish and he made the fullest use of the opportunity.
('68', 23, 6, 28, 46698) Experts alone can judge his art.
('68', 23, 6, 29, 46731) But I could see that Shri

('68', 24, 1, 2, 46802) Savant had varied gifts.
('68', 24, 1, 3, 46827) He showed great application all the time he was with me and was entirely absorbed in his work.
('68', 24, 1, 4, 46922) We found him to be thoroughly sociable and [he] became one of us the moment he came.
('68', 24, 1, 5, 47007) He deserves encouragement from lovers of art and moneyed men.
('68', 24, 1, 6, 47069) I wish him every success.

('68', 24, 6, 11, 47180) MY DEAR AMRIT,
('68', 24, 7, 12, 47195) I am sure the apples sent by you are not from your garden.
('68', 24, 7, 13, 47254) Do you know what railage they mean?
('68', 24, 7, 14, 47290) It is too much of a good thing.
('68', 24, 7, 15, 47322) Let me be satisfied with what local fruit I can get here.
('68', 24, 7, 16, 47380) If they were needed as medicine, I would have asked you to send them.
('68', 24, 7, 17, 47450) But they are not.
('68', 24, 7, 18, 47468) The only fruit, I fancy, I need for the ailing ones is oranges or musumbis.
('68', 24, 7, 19, 47544) And I have arranged for a continuous supply.
('68', 24, 7, 20, 47589) This too may be my fancy but if I am to do with the least amount of drugs, I must, so it appears to me, have honey and oranges.
('68', 24, 7, 21, 47717) And I assure you I am almost extravagant in the use of these articles.
('68', 24, 7, 22, 47788) Therefore please stop buying apples for me.
('68', 24, 7, 23, 47832) When you have the next yield in your own garden I shall gladly have my share.
('68', 24, 7, 24, 47910) I expect Ba this evening.
('68', 24, 7, 25, 47936) She will give me all the latest news about Devdas and Kumarappa though I suppose she will hardly be able to add to the very full information you have been giving me.
('68', 24, 7, 26, 48102) Kumarappas brother, J.M., has been here.
('68', 24, 7, 27, 48143) He is leaving for Bombay this evening.
('68', 24, 7, 28, 48182) They are chips of the same block, so alike in appearance and their liberal outlook of life and love of the land !
('68', 24, 7, 29, 48296) Hope you are well.
('68', 24, 7, 30, 48315) No use saying do not overwork yourself.
('68', 24, 7, 31, 48355) I suppose you have rendered yourself incapable of responding to any such request, advice or even command !

('68', 25, 14, 18, 49200) I have been waiting for your letter which has come at last.
('68', 25, 14, 19, 49260) I did write 2 to you acknowledging the fruit that was sent by you.
('68', 25, 14, 20, 49327) You must pick up strength quickly.
('68', 25, 14, 21, 49362) You cannot afford to play with your body.
('68', 25, 14, 22, 49404) It is a trust for Gods service.
('68', 25, 14, 23, 49436) I was sorry to hear of Ramachandrans death.
('68', 25, 14, 24, 49480) It must mean a loss of a member of the family.
('68', 25, 14, 25, 49527) I know what it means to lose an old and faithful servant.

('68', 26, 5, 8, 49884) September 30, 1935
('68', 26, 6, 9, 49903) MANILAL AND SUSHILA,
('68', 26, 7, 10, 49924) Accidents like the one that happened to Sita are a common occurrence.
('68', 26, 7, 11, 49994) We should not treat them either as a good or a bad omen.
('68', 26, 7, 12, 50051) If both of you feel that she ought to go to a school, that would be the right course to adopt.
('68', 26, 7, 13, 50146) I am firm in my own opinion, though.
('68', 26, 7, 14, 50183) It is the duty of you both to give Sita whatever you have.
('68', 26, 7, 15, 50242) When she is grown up, she may add to it whatever she wishes.
('68', 26, 7, 16, 50303) But I attach no value to my views before yours.
('68', 26, 7, 17, 50351) After all it is you who have to shape her future.
('68', 26, 7, 18, 50401) You know best your difficulties and aspirations.
('68', 26, 7, 19, 50450) It would be proper, therefore, that you should do what you yourselves desire after taking my views into consideration and attaching to them whatever importance you may feel inclined to.
('68', 26, 7, 20, 50636) Ba is returning from Simla this evening.
('68', 26, 7, 21, 50677) Devdas is improving.
('68', 26, 7, 22, 50698) Ramdas has become a little weak.
('68', 26, 7, 23, 50731) He does not wish to leave Bombay.
('68', 26, 7, 24, 50765) Harilal is sanctifying his anatomy in the holy Ganga of liquor.
('68', 26, 7, 25, 50829) Nimu and her children are at present staying with me.
('68', 26, 7, 26, 50883) Kishorelal is keeping indifferent health, as usual.

('68', 28, 4, 11, 52304) God knows whether it is a folly to be angry or to feel pained.
('68', 28, 4, 12, 52367) Pain is a sign of attachment.
('68', 28, 4, 13, 52397) Attachment and anger are signs of rajas.

('68', 32, 4, 6, 56463) I am wholly opposed to Pandit Ramchandras fast because I find ignorance and violence in it.
('68', 32, 4, 7, 56555) Therefore my approving of it is a total impossibility.
('68', 32, 4, 8, 56610) I only appeal to the friends who write to me to persuade him to abandon the fast by giving him the assurance that an agitation would be taken up to stop animal sacrifice.

('68', 34, 3, 4, 59123) MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL 1,
('68', 34, 4, 5, 59145) Your letters come in with clock like regularity and they are such a blessing.
('68', 34, 4, 6, 59223) I see that Kamala is putting forth a very brave effort.
('68', 34, 4, 7, 59279) It will be rewarded.
('68', 34, 4, 8, 59300) You know my partiality for nature cure methods.
('68', 34, 4, 9, 59348) There are in Germany itself many nature cure establishments.
('68', 34, 4, 10, 59409) Kamalas case may be past that stage.
('68', 34, 4, 11, 59446) But one never knows.
('68', 34, 4, 12, 59467) I know of cases which were reported to be for surgical treatment but which yielded to nature cure treatment.
('68', 34, 4, 13, 59576) I send you this experience of mine for what it is worth.
('68', 34, 4, 14, 59633) Your letter about the wearing of the next years crown was delightful.
('68', 34, 4, 15, 59703) I was glad to have your consent.
('68', 34, 4, 16, 59736) I am sure that it would solve many difficulties and it is the rightest thing that could have happened for the country.
('68', 34, 4, 17, 59855) Your presidentship at Lahore 2 was totally different from what it would be at Lucknow 3. In my opinion it was comparatively plain sailing at Lahore in every respect.
('68', 34, 4, 18, 60021) It wont be so in any respect at Lucknow.
('68', 34, 4, 19, 60062) But those circumstances I cannot imagine anybody better able to cope with than you.
('68', 34, 4, 20, 60146) May God give you all the strength to shoulder the burden.
('68', 34, 4, 21, 60204) I am going through your chapters 4 as speedily as I can.
('68', 34, 4, 22, 60261) They are to me of absorbing interest.
('68', 34, 4, 23, 60299) More than that I must not say just now.

('68', 35, 2, 3, 60750) October 3, 1935
('68', 35, 3, 4, 60766) PURUSHOTTAM,
('68', 35, 4, 5, 60779) I got your letter.
('68', 35, 4, 6, 60798) It was a clear one.
('68', 35, 4, 7, 60818) I received a letter from Thakkar Bapa 1 just before I got yours.
('68', 35, 4, 8, 60883) He has placed the whole burden on me.
('68', 35, 4, 9, 60921) I have accordingly written a long letter to Chhaganlal.
('68', 35, 4, 10, 60977) I do not wish to put more pressure on Jivanlalbhai.
('68', 35, 4, 11, 61029) Let him do as much as he can.
('68', 35, 4, 12, 61059) It is not possible to change Chhaganlals methods very much now.
('68', 35, 4, 13, 61123) He can spend his energy in doing service, and Thakkar Bapa is in love with him.
('68', 35, 4, 14, 61203) It is natural, therefore, that he should have full confidence in himself.
('68', 35, 4, 15, 61277) Let him find out a president and carry on the work.
('68', 35, 4, 16, 61329) Thakkar Bapas suggestion is that either Nanalal or Narandas should become the president.
('68', 35, 4, 17, 61418) But Narandas and Chhaganlal will not team up well.
('68', 35, 4, 18, 61469) The two follow their own methods of work and, therefore, the one cannot be president over the other.
('68', 35, 4, 19, 61570) Even if that is possible, however, I wish to get Narandas over here if some other arrangement can be made for his parents.
('68', 35, 4, 20, 61693) Chhaganlal simply cannot leave Kathiawar at present.
('68', 35, 4, 21, 61746) I am sending your letter to him.
('68', 35, 4, 22, 61779) Try and discuss the matter with him to the extent you can.
('68', 35, 4, 23, 61838) Our duty is to serve the Harijans and we have to solve this problem only with a view to finding how best we can do it.
('68', 35, 4, 24, 61957) Your own dissatisfaction certainly does not mean that you wish to give up Harijan work.
('68', 35, 4, 25, 62045) On the contrary you also have the same problem, namely, what contribution you can make to the solution of the difficulty which has arisen.
('68', 35, 4, 26, 62184) Write to me from time to time.

('68', 37, 2, 10, 63960) This suggestion was mine.
('68', 37, 2, 11, 63986) If you have already discussed the matter with Jamnadas and if you can get the whole hearted consent of your parents, send me a wire.

('68', 37, 8, 23, 64534) If you wish, you can derive some consolation from the thought that you are not the only one who avoids writing to me.
('68', 37, 8, 24, 64652) You wrote me a letter if only after nine months.
('68', 37, 8, 25, 64701) Narayandas of course kept me informed about your helath.

('68', 38, 5, 10, 65860) Shri Gopabandhu Choudhury writing from Bari, Cuttack, sends the following three questions:
('68', 38, 6, 11, 65951) 1. In self sufficing khadi what should be the price of surplus khadi?
('68', 38, 7, 12, 66021) 2. If a villager has cotton but no spinners to give him the requirements of his family and he wants to have his cotton spun for his own family requirements by his co villagers or neighbouring villagers, what should be the wage?
('68', 38, 7, 13, 66249) Will the proposed living wage for commercial khadi be applicable here?
('68', 38, 7, 14, 66320) Or, will it be left to mutual adjustment?
('68', 38, 8, 15, 66362) 3. What should be the wage when the spinner has no cotton of her own and she spins not for wages in cash for living but for cotton and that also till she earns a quantity sufficient for her cloth need?
('68', 38, 8, 16, 66564) The price of surplus khadi passing through the A.I.S.A. can only be the same as that of any other in the same province.
('68', 38, 8, 17, 66684) Now that for the most part khadi sales, except for the requirements of cities, will be confined to the province where it is manufactured, the prices in different provinces will perhaps vary more than they do now.
('68', 38, 8, 18, 66897) But there connot be any distinction between surplus khadi and any other.
('68', 38, 8, 19, 66970) Indeed all khadi can only be surplus khadi, for khadi will not be accepted by the Association or its branches from anyone who is not himself or herself a full wearer of khadi.
('68', 38, 8, 20, 67146) Of course the rule may have to be relaxed during the transition stage.
('68', 38, 8, 21, 67217) On the analogy of the first answer, there is no doubt that so far as the Association is concerned it must pay all spinners alike.
('68', 38, 8, 22, 67347) But the Association will not regulate the dealings between spinners themselves.
('68', 38, 8, 23, 67427) They must be allowed to adjust their own mutual relations.

('68', 39, 1, 2, 67555) In the third case also the same principle applies as in the first two.
('68', 39, 1, 3, 67626) The thing to remember is that the Association will be responsible for the payment of the minimum subsistence wage where it is itself concerned.
('68', 39, 1, 4, 67770) If its policy becomes popular and therefore general, no doubt it will be difficult if not impossible for anyone to get things done for less wages.
('68', 39, 1, 5, 67917) And the co operation between A.I.S.A. and A.I.V.I.A. may beomce so powerful that wages in every other department will at once be levelled up to their standard.
('68', 39, 1, 6, 68077) The success of the effort will depend upon the hearty response from the buying public.
('68', 39, 1, 7, 68164) If they will realize that they may no longer exploit the poor villagers on whom depends their existence, the problem of unemploy ment and semi starvation will be automatically solved.

('68', 39, 4, 10, 68386) A. V. Thakkar says in a letter 1 received last week: There is no help like self help.
('68', 39, 4, 11, 68472) God helps those who help them selves.
('68', 39, 4, 12, 68510) If the Harijans concerned will carry out their reported resolve to wipe the dust of Kavitha off their feet, they will not only be happy themselves but they will pave the way for others who may be similarly treated.
('68', 39, 4, 13, 68725) If people migrate in search of employment, how much more should they do so in search of self respect?
('68', 39, 4, 14, 68827) I hope that well wishers of Harijans will help these poor families to vacate inhospitable Kavitha.

('68', 39, 6, 16, 68945) 53. A KNOTTY QUESTION
('68', 39, 7, 17, 68967) Since the talk of the rise in the wages of spinners khadi lovers are filled with all kinds of vague fears.
('68', 39, 7, 18, 69074) For instance, they fear a fall in the public demand for khadi in view of a rise in its price.
('68', 39, 7, 19, 69168) I am hoping that the public will appreciate the little rise that must take place in the price of khadi.
('68', 39, 7, 20, 69272) They have hitherto benefited by the continuous redu ction in prices which hitherto it has been the aim of the Association to achieve by extraordinary effort in the direction.
('68', 39, 7, 21, 69447) The price of khadi
('68', 39, 8, 22, 69466) 1 Not reproduced here.
('68', 39, 8, 23, 69489) Amritlal V. Thakkar had written that Harijans in Kavitha, a village in Ahmedabad district of Gujarat, had been subjected to great hardships by caste Hindus and therefore they had decided to vacate the village.

('68', 40, 0, 1, 69730) VOL. 68 : 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 41
('68', 40, 1, 2, 69775) has been never so low as it is today.
('68', 40, 1, 3, 69813) And yet the sales have gone down owing to want of propaganda.
('68', 40, 1, 4, 69875) If some systematic propaganda is carried on without increasing administrative expenses, I have little doubt that the sales of khadi can be increased in spite of the rise that will take place in the prices.
('68', 40, 1, 5, 70081) But it is well to be prepared for the worst.
('68', 40, 1, 6, 70126) The Association must not be deterred from doing the just thing by the spinners for fear of the public demand falling.
('68', 40, 1, 7, 70244) It must, however, if need be, remove from its list of spinners those who do not need the support of spinning for their food.
('68', 40, 1, 8, 70369) There are hundreds, if not thousands, of spinners who spin for gaining a few pice not for buying food, but for buying tobacco, bangles or the like.
('68', 40, 1, 9, 70517) If there is pressure, these may be told to abstain from competition with those who need coppers for their food.
('68', 40, 1, 10, 70629) The vast majority of spinners are such.
('68', 40, 1, 11, 70669) The question, therefore, for workers is to find who are the needy ones in terms of the Association scheme.
('68', 40, 1, 12, 70776) From the definition will be excluded those petty cultivators who employ labour and who are not ordinarily in want of food and clothing and who are not obliged to sell their holdings or other property to buy food with.
('68', 40, 1, 13, 70994) But it will strain every nerve to give spinning work or other work accessory to spinning, assuring for every one of the occupations not less than a minimum subsistence wage at the rate of eight hours a day, to all those landless and propertyless workers who would starve partially or wholly but for the work found for them by the A.I.S.A.or the A.I.V.I.A. Conversely, these Asso ciations will not concern themselvesnot for want of will but for want of sheer abilitywith those who eke out a living in some other way.
('68', 40, 1, 14, 71510) If these bodies succeed to the full in their mission, they will have not only fulfilled their mission but they will have indirectly helped all the other needy ones and turned their lives of blank despair into those of bright hope.

('68', 41, 3, 4, 71836) Of Shrimati Kiranprava Chaudhuri of Noakhali, who was good enough to send me a beautiful specimen of khadi woven from yarn of her own spinning, a friend of hers writes: 1
('68', 41, 4, 5, 72007) I congratulate this sister on her devotion to khadi.
('68', 41, 4, 6, 72060) Her emphasis on growing tree cotton is supported by several khadi experts throughout India.
('68', 41, 4, 7, 72152) The experiment is worth making on a fairly large scale all over India.
('68', 41, 4, 8, 72223) Evidently it does not require any expense worth the name.
('68', 41, 4, 9, 72281) And if it is true that tree cotton does not need carding, it must mean a great advantage over the ordinary plant cotton.
('68', 41, 4, 10, 72402) I would like those who spin tree cotton to send me their experiences and if possible samples of their cotton and yarn, as also the seeds.

('68', 42, 4, 5, 73349) I got your letter.
('68', 42, 4, 6, 73368) I understand what you say.
('68', 42, 4, 7, 73395) As far as I can help it, I would not give you the trouble of coming to me.

('68', 42, 4, 11, 73798) is an old co worker.
('68', 42, 4, 12, 73819) He is a trustee of a big national institution.
('68', 42, 4, 13, 73866) For the present I will content myself with a few questions.
('68', 42, 4, 14, 73926) If you stick to every word of your letter to Kishorelalbhai, then what about your letter to Manubhai?
('68', 42, 4, 15, 74028) How do you reconcile the two?
('68', 42, 4, 16, 74058) Kishorelalbhai wrote that letter at my instance.
('68', 42, 4, 17, 74107) I wanted to save my time.
('68', 42, 4, 18, 74133) Besides, in your letter to Kishorelalbhai written by you on your own, you had offered to answer any questions that he might ask.
('68', 42, 4, 19, 74262) That is why he wrote those letters to you and asked some questions.
('68', 42, 4, 20, 74330) It was formal courtesy on Kishorelalbhais part to say that you were not bound to answer them, and it was obviously your duty to answer them, if not for anybody elses sake certainly for Shankars sake.
('68', 42, 4, 21, 74530) But dont mind that you didnt answer them.
('68', 42, 4, 22, 74572) Now please reply to this letter and answer the other questions, too, that Kishorelalbhai has asked.

('68', 44, 10, 16, 77297) MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL,
('68', 44, 11, 17, 77317) I wanted to write to you on Sunday but I was so busy that I simply could not do it.
('68', 44, 11, 18, 77401) That was to be in answer to your letter enclosing copy of your letter to Agatha 3. Yours to Agatha gave me an insight into the working of your mind which I would not miss for anything.
('68', 44, 11, 19, 77586) She fully deserved that frankness.
('68', 44, 11, 20, 77621) I can endorse most of your sentiments.
('68', 44, 11, 21, 77660) You do not know that I have written to her more than once in much the same strain though in my own way and my own language.
('68', 44, 11, 22, 77784) Nevertheless if Kamala shows distinct signs of improvement and if you are free to go [to] London and the way is open, I would like you to see the big ones, open yourself out to them even as you have to Agatha.
('68', 44, 11, 23, 77994) But your letter received yesterday shows that you may not leave Kamalas bedside just yet.
('68', 44, 11, 24, 78084) After all you have been freed for that

('68', 45, 1, 4, 78523) How I wish I was there to share your burden and cheer Kamala!
('68', 45, 1, 5, 78585) As I saw her for two days in Bombay before her departure, I observed that she never had so much peace of mind as she seemed to enjoy then.
('68', 45, 1, 6, 78724) Her faith in the benevolence of God, she said, was never so bright as then.
('68', 45, 1, 7, 78800) Her mental disturbance had vanished and she did not mind what happened to her.
('68', 45, 1, 8, 78879) She went to Europe because you all wished it; it seemed to be her obvious duty to do so.
('68', 45, 1, 9, 78968) If she lives, she will live for greater service than she has yet rendered.
('68', 45, 1, 10, 79043) If she dies, she will do so to come down to earth with a body more fitted for her task than the one she has today.
('68', 45, 1, 11, 79158) It is well too that Indus 1 literary studies remain suspended for a while.
('68', 45, 1, 12, 79233) For me, she is having a training that is of far greater value than any she would have in a college.
('68', 45, 1, 13, 79333) She is having her training in the University of Nature.
('68', 45, 1, 14, 79389) She may give the finishing touch by completing her literary studies.
('68', 45, 1, 15, 79458) I am going through your chapters with the deepest interest.
('68', 45, 1, 16, 79518) I should like to finish them at a single sitting as Mahadev did and as Khurshed 2 almost did.
('68', 45, 1, 17, 79612) I have no such good luck.
('68', 45, 1, 18, 79638) I must reserve my opinion till I have reached the last chapter.
('68', 45, 1, 19, 79702) 3 I am thankful that you have sent them to me.
('68', 45, 1, 20, 79749) I am not going to talk to you about the politics.
('68', 45, 1, 21, 79799) It is enough for my purpose that you will shoulder the burden, if it falls to your lot.
('68', 45, 1, 22, 79887) That it will, seems to me to be a foregone conclusion.
('68', 45, 1, 23, 79942) You will read the accompanying to Kamala, if you think fit.
('68', 45, 1, 24, 80002) Indu used to write to me a few lines when you were not there.
('68', 45, 1, 25, 80064) Now I suppose she thinks she is absolved from the task !

('68', 46, 6, 17, 81304) I am passing on your letters for her perusal.
('68', 46, 6, 18, 81350) She is unable to write frankly.
('68', 46, 6, 19, 81382) I do not mind her not writing [to me] as long as she and the children are happy, though I shall persist in my effort of drawing her to me.
('68', 46, 6, 20, 81521) I send you the letter 2 for London that you had asked for.
('68', 46, 6, 21, 81580) Be in no haste to leave America, but you may if there is nothing worth learning or if the expenses are too high.
('68', 46, 6, 22, 81693) Do what you think best.
('68', 46, 6, 23, 81717) There was a birthday greetings cable from New York.
('68', 46, 6, 24, 81769) The name Sharma was also in it, I suppose it was you.
('68', 46, 6, 25, 81823) Do give me word pictures of the people you meet.
('68', 46, 6, 26, 81872) I send only one letter for London, it will do.

('68', 47, 8, 11, 82539) Pandit Bhavani Bhikh Mishra from the Dutch Guiana came to see me along with Shri Benarsidas Chaturvedi, and asked for a message for the Indian immigrant brethren of Suriname.
('68', 47, 8, 12, 82714) All I have to say to you is to live in unity, taking care to lead a pure life by observing chastity of body, mind and speech.
('68', 47, 8, 13, 82840) You should resort to Hindi Hindustani to communicate with one another and open Hindi schools and libraries.

('68', 47, 12, 17, 83059) October 11, 1935
('68', 47, 13, 18, 83076) CHHAGANLAL,
('68', 47, 14, 19, 83088) I got your letter.
('68', 47, 14, 20, 83107) Encouraged by you, I am pressing Jivanlalbhai.
('68', 47, 14, 21, 83154) I am sending your letter to him.
('68', 47, 14, 22, 83187) I will write to you after I receive his reply.
('68', 47, 14, 23, 83234) If Pranjivan Joshi has already been relieved I will not waste time in inquiring into the matter now.
('68', 47, 14, 24, 83335) Let me know the result of your experiments in making manure out of bones and carcasses.
('68', 48, 0, 1, 83423) VOL. 68 : 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 49
('68', 48, 1, 2, 83468) You shouldnt have had the difficulty which you had regarding the use of hand made paper.
('68', 48, 1, 3, 83557) The argument has often been advanced against the use of khadi and we have solved the difficulty in but one way.
('68', 48, 1, 4, 83669) Though khadi is relatively costly, those who have understood its importance have found a way of making it cheap for themselves.
('68', 48, 1, 5, 83797) Many of us, for instance, reduced the consumption of cloth after they started using costly khadi and on the whole effected some saving.
('68', 48, 1, 6, 83933) Those who could not reduce consumption saved on other items but did not accept defeat.
('68', 48, 1, 7, 84020) Similarly, when we resolved to use hand made paper, we reduced writing or included more matter in a given amount of space than previously.
('68', 48, 1, 8, 84159) We stopped using envelopes costing four or five pice and started using postcards costing three pice only.
('68', 48, 1, 9, 84265) I resumed here the practice of writing on small slips of paper, which I used to follow in jail.
('68', 48, 1, 10, 84361) On the balance, therefore, our expenditure on postage has not increased.
('68', 48, 1, 11, 84434) I do not know how things are in Delhi.
('68', 48, 1, 12, 84473) But I hope Malkani has started practising economy.
('68', 48, 1, 13, 84524) What we give to the Government is in fact given to ourselves, It is, therefore, not right to think that we should spend less on postage because the money goes to the Government.
('68', 48, 1, 14, 84702) Even when the Government will be in our hands, it will certainly not be proper for public workers to spend extravagantly on postage.
('68', 48, 1, 15, 84835) In jail, we tried to keep the consumption of everything to a minimum because we thought that all things in the country belonged to us.
('68', 48, 1, 16, 84970) For, no matter who ran the Government, everything it owned belonged to us, the people.
('68', 48, 1, 17, 85057) The money that we give to the Government is spent for Government purposes.
('68', 48, 1, 18, 85132) Because the Government money is spent extravagantly when the Government is in foreign hands, it does not mean that such money ceases to be ours.
('68', 48, 1, 19, 85277) It is our duty of course to check its extravagance.
('68', 48, 1, 20, 85329) But so long as it continues, it is we, the people, who provide the money in one way or another.
('68', 48, 1, 21, 85425) Hence the argument of increase in postage should not be advanced against the use of hand made paper.
('68', 48, 1, 22, 85526) In propagating the use of such paper, the expenditure on postage may perhaps go up in the beginning.
('68', 48, 1, 23, 85627) Even them, if the use of hand made paper is likely to increase through our example we ought not to grudge the additional expense on postage.
('68', 48, 1, 24, 85768) Those teachers who see the moral necessity of manual work will themselves find out some crafts which they can take up.
('68', 48, 1, 25, 85887) Nobody else can advise them in this matter.

('68', 49, 4, 5, 86095) I got your letter.
('68', 49, 4, 6, 86114) You did well in going to Bombay.
('68', 49, 4, 7, 86147) I know about Tulsidass illness.
('68', 49, 4, 8, 86179) I had written to him.
('68', 49, 4, 9, 86201) Now you should write to him.
('68', 49, 4, 10, 86230) What can we do about Harilal?
('68', 49, 4, 11, 86260) It seems he is heading for complete ruin.
('68', 49, 4, 12, 86302) He rarely writes to me.
('68', 49, 4, 13, 86326) He is the fruit of some sins I must have committed.
('68', 49, 4, 14, 86378) How can we blame him?
('68', 49, 4, 15, 86400) Can one ever change ones nature?
('68', 49, 4, 16, 86433) Manu 2 has returned.
('68', 49, 4, 17, 86454) She got quite ill in Delhi.
('68', 49, 4, 18, 86482) She is well now.
('68', 49, 4, 19, 86499) As you know she is lazy about writing letters.
('68', 49, 4, 20, 86546) Kishorelalbhai has asked for her hand for Surendra, his nephew, son of Balubhai.
('68', 49, 4, 21, 86627) Ba and I would very much welcome this alliance.
('68', 49, 4, 22, 86675) If you two sisters 3 and Kunvarji 4 approve of it, I will arrange the betrothal.
('68', 49, 4, 23, 86756) I hope you remember Surendra who was in the Ashram.
('68', 49, 4, 24, 86808) He is in Bombay at present.
('68', 49, 4, 25, 86836) Manu has left the decision to me.

('68', 50, 5, 6, 87748) [Before October 12, 1935]
('68', 50, 6, 7, 87774) You will borrow cotton this season, but next year you must grow your own cotton.
('68', 50, 6, 8, 87855) Anyone will permit you to grow a few cotton trees in his field.
('68', 50, 6, 9, 87919) The seed should be the tree cotton or devakapas.
('68', 50, 6, 10, 87968) It lasts for ten to fifteen years and the cotton, I am told, does not need to be carded.
('68', 50, 6, 11, 88057) I have not used to cotton myself but propose to do so.
('68', 50, 6, 12, 88112) You are right that I did not like your leaving your place even for a couple of days.
('68', 50, 6, 13, 88197) I did not like it because it is a pastime with you, and the best discipline for you is to settle down quietly and work away uninterruptedly for a year.
('68', 50, 6, 14, 88349) A villager absorbed in his work has no time to go on friendly visits.
('68', 50, 6, 15, 88419) We must try to emulate him.
('68', 50, 6, 16, 88447) You must therefore make it a rule not to move out beyond a radius of ten miles.
('68', 50, 6, 17, 88527) It is impossible to get under the skin of the villagers until one lives in their midst all the twenty four hours for an unbroken period.
('68', 50, 6, 18, 88664) The moment you relax the rule, you will find excuses for going.To be free from filth and the dog nuisance is certainly necessary, but one may not run away from them.
('68', 50, 6, 19, 88830) Everyone cannot go out of his house and find conveniences for himself.
('68', 50, 6, 20, 88901) One has also to cultivate that sense of cleanliness in others.
('68', 50, 6, 21, 88964) One must not therefore shun people.
('68', 50, 6, 22, 89000) One cannot serve them from a safe distance.
('68', 50, 6, 23, 89044) I know this is easier said than done, and if you cannot sleep in the midst of these nuisances you will continue to repair to the fields.
('68', 50, 6, 24, 89181) I do not want you to do anything at the risk of your health.
('68', 50, 6, 25, 89242) Yes, you may have in course of time a grass hut, but it should not be far from the village.
('68', 50, 6, 26, 89334) The people must be free to call upon us at all hours of the day and night.
('68', 50, 6, 27, 89409) We must always be within easy call.
('68', 50, 7, 28, 89445) 1 Balkrishna Bhave, younger brother of Vinoba Bhave 2 Extracted from Mahadev Desais Weekly Letter.
('68', 50, 7, 29, 89544) The addressee, one of the best workers working in a Gujarat village, had restricted his needs to Rs. 5 a month.
('68', 51, 0, 1, 89656) 52 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('68', 51, 1, 2, 89697) The fact that you leave the village at 7 p.m.
('68', 51, 1, 3, 89743) every day means that you deprive the villagers of the chance of talking to you and seeking your advice after supper, and that you will not hold even an hours night school.
('68', 51, 1, 4, 89915) You see the difficulty of Ashram inmates serving in the villages.
('68', 51, 1, 5, 89981) The Ashram life and rules might easily become a luxury.
('68', 51, 1, 6, 90037) We must realize that the villagers do not enjoy most of the amenities we enjoy with all our much talked of simplicity and renunciation.
('68', 51, 1, 7, 90173) Man is naturally apt to turn every renunciation into a joy.
('68', 51, 1, 8, 90233) Sannyasa which cannotes the highest renunciation has become today the biggest source of laziness and indulgence for many!
('68', 51, 1, 9, 90355) The scavengers will slowly understand your work of love.
('68', 51, 1, 10, 90412) You must make them understand that you do not want to oust them, but to improve their efficiency.
('68', 51, 1, 11, 90510) You must also find out for them more sources of income.
('68', 51, 1, 12, 90566) Because my recent renunciation was a source of pang, it need not have grieved you.
('68', 51, 1, 13, 90649) The pang was a source of joy, and such pangs are inevitable.
('68', 51, 2, 14, 90710) Harijan, 12 10 1935
('68', 51, 3, 15, 90730) 69. NOTES
('68', 51, 4, 16, 90740) TO PRIVATE CORRESPONDENTS
('68', 51, 5, 17, 90766) As time advances, my private correspondence too keeps on advancing at an accelerated speed and leaves its adversary for behind.
('68', 51, 5, 18, 90894) My capacity to overtake this ever increasing correspondence decreases in the same ratio as the increase in the volume of my correspondence.
('68', 51, 5, 19, 91034) The mischief is aggravated by the new tasks that have come to me unsolicited.
('68', 51, 5, 20, 91112) The most absorbing and fascinating is the work of village regeneration or, to adopt a current word, rejuvenation.
('68', 51, 5, 21, 91226) The fascination increases with a growing perception of the difficulty of the work.
('68', 51, 5, 22, 91309) My mind is living in the villages.
('68', 51, 5, 23, 91344) They are calling me to bury myself in them.
('68', 51, 5, 24, 91388) I do not know how this internal struggle will end.
('68', 51, 5, 25, 91439) Difficulties are already cropping up to prevent such a burial.
('68', 51, 5, 26, 91502) Much against my will I have been obliged to make a promise to shoulder a burden in Gujarat early next year.
('68', 51, 5, 27, 91610) I know what it will bring in its trail.
('68', 51, 5, 28, 91650) Gods will be done.
('68', 51, 5, 29, 91669) But if a breakdown is not to take place,
('68', 51, 6, 30, 91710) 1 The addressee had referred to Gandhijis renunciation; vide A Renunciation, 21 9 1935.
('68', 52, 0, 1, 91798) VOL. 68 : 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 53
('68', 52, 1, 2, 91843) I must cut off as much private correspondence as possible and deal with the most necessary part of it through deputy.
('68', 52, 1, 3, 91961) Then only can I at all hope to cope with the increasing call of Harijan.
('68', 52, 1, 4, 92034) The extent of its scope has meant much additional burden on both Mahadev Desai and me.
('68', 52, 1, 5, 92121) If the readers are to receive justice, we must free ourselves for it more than we have done hitherto.
('68', 52, 1, 6, 92223) This is, therefore, written to invite the co operation of my many correspondents.
('68', 52, 1, 7, 92305) Let them be assured that I am not tired of the correspondence.
('68', 52, 1, 8, 92368) I have prized their confidence beyond measure.
('68', 52, 1, 9, 92415) It has given me an insight into human nature and its ultimate nobility I should not have had otherwise.
('68', 52, 1, 10, 92519) Such correspondence I have carried on for over a generation.
('68', 52, 1, 11, 92580) My writings and publication of some of my correspondence provide sufficient help to those who will know my opinion on a given problem.
('68', 52, 1, 12, 92715) I know that nothing can be a substitute for personal contact.
('68', 52, 1, 13, 92777) But in the nature of things it is a perishable article, very fragile.
('68', 52, 1, 14, 92847) I would urge correspondents to deny themselves the temptation of referring to me on all kinds of problems.
('68', 52, 1, 15, 92954) Let them take the trouble of solving them themselves with such help as writings on ethics and eternal verities can give.
('68', 52, 1, 16, 93075) They will find that they will do better in the end than if they would make of me a dictionary of reference on every occasion.
('68', 52, 1, 17, 93201) Any way let my private correspondents not be surprised if they find that they no longer hear from me directly or that their letters remain unanswered or are answered on my behalf.
('68', 52, 2, 18, 93381) DUTY OF SPEAKING GENTLY
('68', 52, 3, 19, 93405) A Gujarati correspondent writes: Speaking unnecessarily loud affects the health of hearers.
('68', 52, 3, 20, 93497) In this country and among us, women and children, more than men, are in the habit of speaking much louder than we need and a false sense of delicacy makes most of us, even though we may be aware of the noise and its ill effects, tolerate such speaking which really grates on our ears.
('68', 52, 3, 21, 93782) We would not protest.
('68', 52, 3, 22, 93804) This may be a sign of our ahimsa but I would not classify it under courtesy.
('68', 52, 3, 23, 93881) Model Montessory schools can be abodes of peace, not so our socalled homes, much less our institutions or our public roads.
('68', 52, 3, 24, 94005) You advise people not to tolerate insanitation.
('68', 52, 3, 25, 94053) Cay you not do likewise about noises that are almost equally injurious to health?
('68', 52, 3, 26, 94135) I am quite clear that gentle speech should have the same place in our system of education as sanitation.
('68', 52, 3, 27, 94240) May I warn you that you are yourself often guilty of tolerating
('68', 53, 0, 1, 94304) 54 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('68', 53, 1, 2, 94345) the vice of loud speaking about you and thus injuring your health and missing the opportunity of educating public opinion.
('68', 53, 2, 3, 94468) I must plead guilty to the charge.
('68', 53, 2, 4, 94503) What the correspondent says is largely true.
('68', 53, 2, 5, 94548) I have often tolerated maddening noises which could have been easily avoided.
('68', 53, 2, 6, 94626) I am well aware that they are injurious to health.
('68', 53, 2, 7, 94677) The object of giving place to this correspondent, however, is to draw the attention of teachers to this national defect and invite them to make a beginning by restraining their pupils from making noises and speaking loud in class rooms and outside.
('68', 53, 2, 8, 94926) In railway trains these noises are simply maddening.
('68', 53, 2, 9, 94979) They are made in total disregard of the feelings of fellow passengers.
('68', 53, 2, 10, 95050) Many indulge in loud talks which they can easily carry on in gentle tones.
('68', 53, 2, 11, 95125) In this connection I am reminded of the meetings of Sikhs in which whenever necessity arises someone on the platform puts up a board which is fastened onto a long bamboo containing the words Please avoid loud talking or Peace Peace.
('68', 53, 2, 12, 95358) Some such device can be adopted by passengers who notice such noises.
('68', 53, 3, 13, 95428) WASTE INTO WEALTH
('68', 53, 4, 14, 95446) Those who have been following what is being written in these columns on balanced diet will not have failed to understand the vast importance of bran which we simply throw away and give to our cattle.
('68', 53, 4, 15, 95646) I do not grudge the cattle what they get.
('68', 53, 4, 16, 95688) But it seems to me that we are thoughtless about cattle feeding as about many other things.
('68', 53, 4, 17, 95780) Cattle do not need bran so much as green fodder and seed cakes which they can easily divide with us if we will revert to the village oil presses.
('68', 53, 4, 18, 95926) But we need every ounce of the bran of wheat and rice if we are to become efficient instruments of production not to be beaten on this earth by any race, and yet without the necessity of entering into killing competition or literally killing one another.
('68', 53, 4, 19, 96181) But I must not prolong what is becoming a heavy preface to a simple recipe which a friend has passed on to me for treating wheat bran.
('68', 53, 4, 20, 96316) He is obliged to his sister for it.
('68', 53, 4, 21, 96352) Here it is:
('68', 53, 5, 22, 96364) Grind sufficient wheat coarse to give you one pound of bran which you get by passing the meal through a medium sieve.
('68', 53, 5, 23, 96482) Add 1 1 2 lb.
('68', 53, 5, 24, 96496) of cold water, eight tolas of pulverized clean gur and half a tea spoonful of clean salt to the bran and stir well.
('68', 53, 5, 25, 96612) Pour the mixture in a flat vessel, cover and let it stand for full half hour.
('68', 53, 5, 26, 96690) Then put a well fitting tava or dish on the pot
('68', 54, 0, 1, 96738) VOL. 68 : 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 55
('68', 54, 1, 2, 96783) containing the mixture and stand it on hot coal and heap hot coals on top.
('68', 54, 1, 3, 96858) Keep the pot between the two fires for full five minutes.
('68', 54, 1, 4, 96916) Then transfer the mixture onto an iron kadai and roast on a slow fire till the water is fairly dried out.
('68', 54, 1, 5, 97022) Then take the pot off the chula and let the contents cool.
('68', 54, 1, 6, 97081) Then strain them through a sieve with clean hands and the contents will drop on a clean cloth or board in the form of threads.
('68', 54, 1, 7, 97208) Expose these to the sun till thoroughly dry.
('68', 54, 1, 8, 97253) These can be taken as they are or with hot or cold milk or hot water or whey.
('68', 54, 1, 9, 97331) Two ounces will make a good breakfast and is claimed to be a valuable aid to remove constipationthe bane of civilized life and precursor of many diseases.
('68', 54, 2, 10, 97486) FOR FOUR RUPEES A MONTH
('68', 54, 3, 11, 97510) Dr. Aykroyd, Director of Nutrition Research at Coonoor, recently delivered an instructive lecture at Bangalore.
('68', 54, 3, 12, 97622) From the lecture as published in the daily Press it appears that a well balanced diet need not cost more than Rs. 4 per month.
('68', 54, 3, 13, 97749) Thus the lecturer said that:
('68', 54, 4, 14, 97778) The dietary requirements of an adult man per day were 16 ounces of ragi 1, two ounces of soya bean 2, an ounce of jaggery, four ounces each of spinach and amaranth, an ounce each of potatoes and colacasia, 1.5 ounces of coconut oil and six ounces of buttermilkall costing about two annas.

('68', 54, 6, 16, 98087) 70. CONSOLATION FOR THE AGED AND THE INFIRM
('68', 54, 7, 17, 98131) Dr. Sir P.C. Ray is 75 years old.
('68', 54, 7, 18, 98165) He has been a weakling in body from youth upward.
('68', 54, 7, 19, 98215) Yet he is foremost among the chemists of the world and retains to the present day the vigour and energy of youth.
('68', 54, 7, 20, 98329) His greed for service is insatiable.
('68', 54, 7, 21, 98366) He never refuses to help people in distress, especially the student world.
('68', 54, 7, 22, 98441) He is so generous that swindlers have been known successfully to have exploited his name.
('68', 54, 7, 23, 98531) He has not minded this.
('68', 54, 7, 24, 98555) He takes pride in his prodigality and turns away from those who plead with him to discriminate.
('68', 54, 7, 25, 98651) He works away till late at night, keeps an open door, and has a smile for everybody.
('68', 54, 7, 26, 98736) In spite of all this output of service why does he remain so fresh when many of

('68', 55, 1, 2, 98954) his contemporaries have either joined the majority or are too infirm to do any work?
('68', 55, 1, 3, 99039) He gives the answer in a remarkable chapter he has written for the second volume of his autobiography.
('68', 55, 1, 4, 99142) He had occasion to write to me on the event of my birthday.
('68', 55, 1, 5, 99202) Without even mentioning (to him) the insignificant event (for am I not a youngster compared to him?), he quietly sends me the foul proof of that chapter.
('68', 55, 1, 6, 99356) 1 It is so full of bright hope that I have no hesitation in sharing it with the readers especially old and infirm, though I have no doubt that young people can read it with profit.
('68', 55, 1, 7, 99537) To the reasons Dr. Ray has given for his energy in 2 old age I would add his irrepressible humour and his boyishness.
('68', 55, 1, 8, 99655) I have seen him shamelessly mount on the shoulders of his bulky friends like Sjt.
('68', 55, 1, 9, 99737) Jamnalalji or Maulana Shaukat Ali and cracking all kinds of joke, forgetting for the moment that the world knows him as a serious scientist and Principal of a great college of science of which he is virtually also the creator.

('68', 55, 3, 11, 99984) 71. THE GREATEST FORCE
('68', 55, 4, 12, 100007) Non violence is at the root of every one of my activities and therefore also of the three public activities on which I am just now visibly concentrating all my energy.
('68', 55, 4, 13, 100175) These are untouchability, khadi, and village regeneration in general.
('68', 55, 4, 14, 100245) Hindu Muslim unity is my fourth love.
('68', 55, 4, 15, 100283) But so far as any visible manifestation is concerned, I have owned defeat on that score.
('68', 55, 4, 16, 100372) Let the public, however, not assume therefrom that I am inactive.
('68', 55, 4, 17, 100438) If not during my lifetime, I know that after my death both Hindus and Mussalmans will bear witness that I had never ceased to yearn after communal peace.
('68', 55, 4, 18, 100592) Non violence to be a creed has to be all pervasive.
('68', 55, 4, 19, 100644) I cannot be non violent about one activity of mine and violent about others.
('68', 55, 4, 20, 100721) That would be a policy, not a life force.
('68', 55, 4, 21, 100763) That being so, I cannot be indif ferent about the war that Italy is now waging against Abyssinia.
('68', 55, 4, 22, 100861) But I have resisted 3 most pressing invitation to express my opinion and give a lead to the country.
('68', 55, 4, 23, 100962) Self suppression is often necessary in the inte rest of Truth and non violence.
('68', 55, 4, 24, 101042) If India had as a nation imbibed the creed of non violence, corporate or national, I should have had no

('68', 56, 1, 2, 101323) hesitation in giving a lead.
('68', 56, 1, 3, 101352) But in spite of a certain hold I have on the millions of this country, I know the very grave and glaring limitation of that hold.
('68', 56, 1, 4, 101482) India had an unbroken tradition of non violence from times imm emorial.
('68', 56, 1, 5, 101554) But at no time in her ancient history, as far as I know it, has it had complete non violence in action pervading the whole land.
('68', 56, 1, 6, 101683) Nevertheless, it is my unshakable belief that her destiny is to deliver the message of non violence to mankind.
('68', 56, 1, 7, 101795) It may take ages to come to fruition.
('68', 56, 1, 8, 101833) But so far as I can judge, no other country will precede her in the fulfilment of that mission.
('68', 56, 1, 9, 101929) Be that as it may, it is seasonable to contemplate the implications of that matchless force.
('68', 56, 1, 10, 102022) Three concrete questions were, the other day, incidentally asked by friends:
('68', 56, 2, 11, 102099) 1.What could ill armed Abyssinia do against well armed Italy, if she were non 
('68', 56, 3, 12, 102178) violent?
('68', 56, 4, 13, 102187) 2.What could England, the greatest and the most powerful member of the
('68', 56, 5, 14, 102258) League, do against determined Italy, if she (England) were non violent in your sense of the term?
('68', 56, 6, 15, 102356) 3. What could India do, if she suddenly became non violent in your sense of the term?
('68', 56, 6, 16, 102442) Before I answer the question let me lay down five simple axioms of non violence as I know it:
('68', 56, 7, 17, 102536) 1. Non violence implies as complete self purification as is humanly possible.
('68', 56, 7, 18, 102614) 2. Man for man the strength of non violence is in exact proportion to the ability, not the will, of the non violent person to inflict violence.
('68', 56, 7, 19, 102758) 3. Non violence is without exception superior to violence, i.e., the power at the disposal of a non violent person is always greater than he would have if he was violent.
('68', 56, 7, 20, 102929) 4. There is no such thing as defeat in non violence.
('68', 56, 7, 21, 102982) The end of violence is surest defeat.
('68', 56, 7, 22, 103020) 5. The ultimate end of non violence is surest victoryif such a term may be used of non violence.
('68', 56, 7, 23, 103117) In reality where there is no sense of defeat, there is no sense of victory.
('68', 56, 7, 24, 103193) The foregoing questions may be answered in the light of these axioms.
('68', 56, 8, 25, 103263) 1. If Abyssinia were non violent, she would have no arms, would want none.
('68', 56, 8, 26, 103338) She would make no appeal to the League or any other
('68', 57, 0, 1, 103390) 58 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('68', 57, 1, 2, 103431) power for armed intervention.
('68', 57, 1, 3, 103461) She would never give any cause for complaint.
('68', 57, 1, 4, 103507) And Italy would find nothing to conquer if Abyssinians would not offer armed resistance, nor would they give co operation willing or forced.
('68', 57, 1, 5, 103648) Italian occupation in that case would mean that of the land without its people.
('68', 57, 1, 6, 103728) That, however, is not Italys exact object.
('68', 57, 1, 7, 103771) She seeks submission of the people of the beautiful land.
('68', 57, 1, 8, 103829) 2. If Englishmen were as a nation to become non violent at heart, they would shed imperialism, they would give up the use of arms.
('68', 57, 1, 9, 103960) The moral force generated by such an act of renunciation would stagger Italy into willing surrender of her designs.
('68', 57, 1, 10, 104076) England would then be a living embodiment of the axioms I have laid down.
('68', 57, 1, 11, 104150) The effect of such conversion would mean the greatest miracle of all ages.
('68', 57, 1, 12, 104225) And yet if non violence is not an idle dream, some such thing has some day to come to pass somewhere.
('68', 57, 1, 13, 104327) I live in that faith.
('68', 57, 1, 14, 104349) 3. The last question may be answered thus.
('68', 57, 1, 15, 104392) As I have said, India as a nation is not non violent in the full sense of the term.
('68', 57, 1, 16, 104476) Neither has she any capacity for offering violencenot because she has no arms.
('68', 57, 1, 17, 104555) Physical possession of arms is the least necessity of the brave.
('68', 57, 1, 18, 104620) Her non violence is that of the weak.
('68', 57, 1, 19, 104658) She betrays her weakness in many of her daily acts.
('68', 57, 1, 20, 104710) She appears before the world today as a decaying nation.
('68', 57, 1, 21, 104767) I mean here not in the mere political sense but essentially in the non violent, moral sense.
('68', 57, 1, 22, 104860) She lacks the ability of offer physical resistance.
('68', 57, 1, 23, 104912) She has no consciousness of strength.
('68', 57, 1, 24, 104950) She is conscious only of her weakness.
('68', 57, 1, 25, 104989) If she were otherwise, there would be no communal problems, nor political.
('68', 57, 1, 26, 105064) If she were non violent in the consciousness of her strength, Englishmen would lose their role of distrustful conquerors.
('68', 57, 1, 27, 105186) We may talk politically as we like and often legitimately blame the English rulers.
('68', 57, 1, 28, 105270) But if we, as Indians, could but for a moment visualize ourselves as a strong people disdaining to strike, we should cease to fear Englishmen whether as soldiers, traders or administrators, and they to distrust us.
('68', 57, 1, 29, 105485) Therefore if we became truly non violent we should carry Englishmen with us in all we might do.
('68', 57, 1, 30, 105581) In other words, we being millions would be the greatest moral force in the world, and Italy would listen to our friendly word.
('68', 57, 2, 31, 105708) The reader has, I hope, by now perceived that my argument is but a feeble and clumsy attempt to prove my axioms which to be such must be self proved.
('68', 57, 2, 32, 105858) Till my eyes of geometrical understanding had been opened, my brain was swimming, as I read and re read the twelve axioms of
('68', 58, 0, 1, 105983) VOL. 68 : 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 59
('68', 58, 1, 2, 106028) Euclid.
('68', 58, 1, 3, 106036) After the opening of my eyes geometry seemed to be the easiest science to learn.
('68', 58, 1, 4, 106117) Much more so is the case with non violence.
('68', 58, 1, 5, 106161) It is a matter of faith and experience, not of argument beyond a point.
('68', 58, 1, 6, 106233) So long as the world refuses to believe, she mustawait a miracle, i.e., an ocular demonstration of non violence on a mass scale.
('68', 58, 1, 7, 106362) They say this is against human naturenon violence is only for the individual.
('68', 58, 1, 8, 106440) If so, where is the difference in kind between man and beast?

('68', 58, 4, 12, 106604) We must once for all dismiss the thought of competing with futile soul killing economics.
('68', 58, 4, 13, 106694) Do you know the insidious way in which Japanese fents are glutting the market?
('68', 58, 4, 14, 106773) Whereas less than five years ago they were a few thousand yards, they amount to millions of yards today.
('68', 58, 4, 15, 106878) How can you compete with these?
('68', 58, 4, 16, 106910) No, we must no longer aim at reducing the prices in order to meet this competition.
('68', 58, 4, 17, 106994) We have all these years thought of the consumer and done precious little for the spinner, forgetting that the Association was a spinners association, not an association of consumers.
('68', 58, 4, 18, 107177) We have to be the true repre sen tatives of the spinners which we have ceased to be.
('68', 58, 4, 19, 107262) The result is that we have simply jogged on and relied on the political upheavals and indulged in a kind of gamble.
('68', 58, 4, 20, 107378) What is the use of all the fancy advertisements that you have been giving? I asked Jerajani 3. We shall soon end in justifying the charge that we are maintaining the institution in order to provide work for the middle class unemp loyed. It is therefore that I suggest that we should no more incur losses in order to exploit the neediest of our fellowmen.
('68', 58, 4, 21, 107733) In order to give a hundred women a satisfactory wage, you will run the risk of depriving thousands of them of employment? is the question that was put to me.
('68', 58, 4, 22, 107891) I say it is a crisis that it is necessary to produce in order to get rid of a remittent fever.

('68', 59, 1, 3, 108378) We may have produced millions of rupees worth of khadi but we have gone nowhere nearer the goal.
('68', 59, 1, 4, 108475) I ask you to forget the cities and the consumer in the cities.
('68', 59, 1, 5, 108538) Concentrate on making the thirty crores of our villagers produce and use their own khadi, and the one crore of the city dwellers will automatically begin wearing khadi.
('68', 59, 1, 6, 108707) Do not mind a temporary lull or a breakdown.
('68', 59, 1, 7, 108752) If there is no demand, do not produce the supply.
('68', 59, 1, 8, 108802) Where your bhandars are run at a loss close them down, and tell all those who care to have your khadi that you are prepared to get it made for them but only at the revised rates.
('68', 59, 1, 9, 108981) But I do not want to thrust my proposal on you.
('68', 59, 1, 10, 109029) You may reject it, if it fails to carry conviction.
('68', 59, 1, 11, 109081) Do not assume on your shoulders heavier responsibility than they can bear.
('68', 59, 1, 12, 109156) Cut your coat according to your cloth.
('68', 59, 1, 13, 109195) Let me tell you that in the production centre at Savli there are already spinners who are satisfying the conditions of the new wage and have begun to earn from three to four annas daily.
('68', 59, 1, 14, 109382) Concentrate on self sufficing khadi wherever it is possible, and a healthy khadi atmosphere will grow out of it.
('68', 59, 1, 15, 109495) In Kathiawar, for instance, for a time they made desperate attempts to run several centres and to stimulate the sale of khadi thus produced.
('68', 59, 1, 16, 109636) They have given it up now, and among the replies that Sjt.
('68', 59, 1, 17, 109695) Shankerlal Banker has received is one from the Secretary of the Kathiawar Branch to the effect that he has no criticism to offer and no opinion to express on the new policy, inasmuch as all the production in that centre consists of self sufficient khadi.

('68', 60, 6, 8, 110485) The same circular states that the spinning wheel alone was used for spinning and women belonging to the Kanbi, Koli, Rajput, Vania, Brahmin, Khoja, Memon, Darji, Luhar, Suthar, Mochi, Ghanchi, Dhed, Bhangi and all other communities used to engage in spinning.
('68', 60, 6, 9, 110745) The Dheds alone did the work of weaving with looms.
('68', 60, 6, 10, 110797) Altogether, 53 spinning wheels and 10 looms were in operation.
('68', 60, 6, 11, 110860) The following is a communitywise break up of the women who did the work of spinning:

('68', 60, 15, 21, 111537) The production of cotton in Vadod and Kathiawar has increased, not decreased.
('68', 60, 15, 22, 111615) And the situation that obtains in the large industries is also to be found in the smallest industries.
('68', 60, 15, 23, 111718) We can easily imagine how impoverished the people would become when they do not utilize the raw material grown in their vicinity but instead sell it to others.
('68', 60, 15, 24, 111878) And this is what we actually see today.
('68', 60, 15, 25, 111918) The small scale industries which once flourished in the villages are no longer there.
('68', 60, 15, 26, 112004) Hence men and women are unemployed for most of the time.

('68', 61, 3, 4, 112270) DEAR GURUDEV, Your touching letter was received only on 11th instant when I was in the midst of meetings.
('68', 61, 3, 5, 112376) In the hope of delivering it to me personally Anil needlessly detained it.
('68', 61, 3, 6, 112451) I hope he is now quite restored to health.
('68', 61, 3, 7, 112494) Yes, I have the financial position before me now.
('68', 61, 3, 8, 112544) You may depend upon my straining every nerve to find the required money.
('68', 61, 3, 9, 112617) I am groping.
('68', 61, 3, 10, 112631) I am trying to find the way out.
('68', 61, 3, 11, 112664) It will take some time before I can report the result of my search to you.
('68', 61, 3, 12, 112739) It is unthinkable that you should have to undertake another begging mission at your age.
('68', 61, 3, 13, 112828) The necessary funds must come to you without your having to stir out of Santiniketan.
('68', 61, 4, 14, 112914) I hope you are keeping well.

('68', 61, 9, 22, 113245) I have gone through it.
('68', 61, 9, 23, 113269) It does not admit of corrections.
('68', 61, 9, 24, 113303) Your writing is always proper and easy to follow.
('68', 61, 9, 25, 113353) The argument runs smooth.
('68', 61, 9, 26, 113379) But it is not what I had expected.
('68', 61, 9, 27, 113414) It is not a striking statement of the position.
('68', 61, 9, 28, 113462) I now appreciate when you said, you had never had to perform such a mission before.

('68', 62, 1, 5, 113948) Then if you feel like it you will write something independently, perhaps for your Association 1. I do not worry about Devdas.
('68', 62, 1, 6, 114074) I know he would have done no better, if he was with me.
('68', 62, 1, 7, 114130) And most certainly he would not have received from me the same care which you and Shummy 2 are able to give.
('68', 62, 1, 8, 114239) My fear is that you are worrying unnecessarily.

('68', 62, 5, 20, 114776) Devdas is still in Simla.
('68', 62, 5, 21, 114802) Pyarelal is with him.
('68', 62, 5, 22, 114824) He seems to be improving.
('68', 62, 5, 23, 114850) But he still needs very careful nursing.
('68', 62, 5, 24, 114891) There is no cause for worry.
('68', 62, 5, 25, 114920) Ramdas is battling with fate in Bombay.

('68', 63, 4, 6, 115501) Please copy it out on a telegraph form and send it.
('68', 63, 4, 7, 115553) We do not have to pay any money as you will see.
('68', 63, 4, 8, 115602) It is possible that as the cable went to Sabarmati the money also went there.
('68', 63, 4, 9, 115680) But there should be some authority at Bombay Central.
('68', 63, 4, 10, 115734) Of course, they may not accept it because the 14th is already over.
('68', 63, 4, 11, 115802) Even then there is no harm.
('68', 63, 4, 12, 115830) In that case we would be spared the trouble.
('68', 63, 4, 13, 115875) We do not want to spend any money.
('68', 63, 4, 14, 115910) If it cannot be done, return the telegram and the reply.
('68', 63, 4, 15, 115967) You will be well.

('68', 63, 9, 24, 116262) With reference to Dr. Ambedkars speech 3 at Yeoli, Mahatma Gandhi said: The speech attributed to Dr. Ambedkar seems to be unbelievable.
('68', 63, 9, 25, 116398) If, however, he has made such a speech and the
('68', 63, 10, 26, 116445) 1 This last sentence has been included in Letter to Mathuradas Trikumji, 14 10 1935 2 This appeared in Harijan, 19 10 1935, under the title Unfortunate.
('68', 63, 10, 27, 116598) 3 On October 14 at the Bombay Presidency Depressed Classes Conference, Nasik, B.R. Ambedkar had said : Because we have the misfortune to call ourselves Hindus, we are treated thus.
('68', 63, 10, 28, 116779) If we were members of another faith none dare treat us so .
('68', 63, 10, 29, 116839) Choose any religion which gives you equality of status and treatment. On Ambedkars advice, the Conference unanimously passed a resolution urging complete severance of the Depressed Classes from the Hindu fold and their embracing any other religion which guaranteed them equal status and treatment with the other members of it.

('68', 64, 1, 2, 117211) conference adopted the resoultion of complete severance and acceptance of any faith that would guarantee equality, I regard both as unfortunate events, especially when one notices that in spite of isolated events to the contrary, untouchability is on its last legs.
('68', 64, 1, 3, 117477) I can understand the anger of a high souled and highly educated person like Dr. Ambedkar over the atrocities as were committed in Kavitha and other villages.
('68', 64, 1, 4, 117635) 1 But religion is not like a house or a cloak which can be changed at will.
('68', 64, 1, 5, 117711) It is more an integral part of ones self than of ones body.
('68', 64, 1, 6, 117771) Religion is the tie that binds one to ones Creator and whilst the body perishes, as it has to, religion persists even after death.
('68', 64, 1, 7, 117902) If Dr. Ambedkar has faith in God, I would urge him to assuage his wrath and reconsider the position and examine his ancestral religion on its own merits and not through the weakness of its faithless followers.
('68', 64, 1, 8, 118112) Lastly, I am convinced that change of faith by him and those who passed the resolution will not serve the cause which they have at heart; for millions of unsophisticated, illiterate Harijans will not listen to him and them when they have disowned their ancestral faith, especially when it is remembered that their lives, for good or for evil, are intertwined with those of caste Hindus.

('68', 66, 4, 5, 120523) Your very important letter to hand.
('68', 66, 4, 6, 120559) I have wired 1 to Rajendra Babu about Swaraj Bhawan.
('68', 66, 4, 7, 120612) I do not know what is happening.
('68', 66, 4, 8, 120645) I am entirely of your opinion that the policy of the Committee should be strictly defined.
('68', 66, 4, 9, 120736) As to our attitude on the present world situation, I do not think there is want of appreciation of it.
('68', 66, 4, 10, 120839) But it is our helplessness which imposes silence on us.
('68', 66, 4, 11, 120895) There is no weakness either.
('68', 66, 4, 12, 120924) It is merely a matter, if you will, of tactics in the best sense of the term.
('68', 66, 4, 13, 121002) Anyway I have no sense in me of weakness.
('68', 66, 4, 14, 121044) But I know that I cannot speak with effect at this juncture.
('68', 66, 4, 15, 121105) I cannot give the lead without knowing what the people can do.
('68', 66, 4, 16, 121168) I know what they should do.
('68', 66, 4, 17, 121196) And what is true of me is perhaps equally true of the majority of our workers.
('68', 66, 4, 18, 121275) But I have great faith in you in these matters.
('68', 66, 4, 19, 121323) You have undoubtedly a much greater grasp of the situation than any one of us has, certainly than I can ever hope to have.
('68', 66, 4, 20, 121446) Therefore you may be able to evolve a dignified formula for national self expression in speech as well as in action assuming of course that at the present moment direct action is ruled out.
('68', 66, 4, 21, 121636) Your paragraph about Kamala is somewhat disturbing.
('68', 66, 4, 22, 121688) But we are prepared for these ups and downs.
('68', 66, 4, 23, 121733) I must await your further contribution on the Constitution 2 before I say anything.

('68', 67, 9, 17, 122877) You can serve the country: 1. By spinning daily even and strong yarn for the sake of Daridranarayana; by keeping a diary of the time for which you have spun, of the quantity spun, with its weight and count; and reporting the work to me every month.
('68', 67, 9, 18, 123126) Yarn should be carefully collected and held at my disposal.
('68', 67, 9, 19, 123186) 2. By daily selling some khadi on behalf of the local certified bhandar and by keeping a record of your daily sales.
('68', 67, 9, 20, 123303) 3. By saving at least one pice per day.
('68', 67, 9, 21, 123343) 4. By holding the collection at my disposal.
('68', 67, 9, 22, 123388) The implication of the adjective least should be understood, namely, that if you are able to save more, you should pour more into Daridranarayanas chest.
('68', 67, 10, 23, 123542) 1 The subscription is in Gujarati.
('68', 67, 10, 24, 123577) 2 Extracted from Mahadev Desais Weekly Letter.
('68', 67, 10, 25, 123624) The student had ex pressed his keenness to serve during his spare time without prejudice to his studies.

('68', 68, 1, 2, 123774) 5. By visiting Harijan quarters in company with other students; and with your companions cleaning the quarters, befriending the children and giving them useful lessons in sanitation, hygiene, etc.
('68', 68, 1, 3, 123971) Then if you can save some more time, you should learn some village industries for future service of villagers after finishing your studies.
('68', 68, 1, 4, 124111) When you have been able to do these things and have still time and ambition for doing more, consistently with your studies, you can ask me and I shall send you more suggestions.

('68', 68, 3, 6, 124309) 85. SOYA BEANS
('68', 68, 4, 7, 124324) It has been found that soya beans can be cooked whold and eaten like any other beans.
('68', 68, 4, 8, 124410) Shri Narhar Bhave of Baroda, who has given his three gifted and gentle sons, Vinoba, Balkrishna and Shivaji, to national service, is himself a careful observer, 61 years old.
('68', 68, 4, 9, 124585) He is living almost wholly on milk and six ounces of soya beans and is keeping perfect health and strength.
('68', 68, 4, 10, 124693) He is of opinion that soya beans help him to avoid constipation which milk alone or milk taken in combination with cereals and vegetables could not do.
('68', 68, 4, 11, 124845) Soya beans have in his opinion helped him also to avoid flatulence which other pulses or milk produced.
('68', 68, 4, 12, 124949) He has come to this conclusion after an unbroken experience of over ten months.
('68', 68, 4, 13, 125029) I may add that Shri Bhave used to suffer from gout and corpulence and had a trace of diabetes.
('68', 68, 4, 14, 125124) He got rid of this triple disability by mere careful dieting.
('68', 68, 4, 15, 125186) In imitation of Shri Bhave the inmates of Maganwadi including me have been trying soya beans for the last few days.
('68', 68, 4, 16, 125302) It is too early yet to pronounce any opinion for ourselves.
('68', 68, 4, 17, 125362) Each inmate gets a heaped dessert spoonful per day.
('68', 68, 4, 18, 125414) This is how the beans are cooked: Clean the beans of foreign particles or dirt, wash in cold water and soak at least for twelve hours, and not more than eighteen, and drain off superfluous water.
('68', 68, 4, 19, 125610) Put these beans in boiling water and cook for fifteen minutes on a quick fire.
('68', 68, 4, 20, 125689) No salt or soda to be added while cooking.
('68', 68, 4, 21, 125732) Salt may be added later.
('68', 68, 4, 22, 125757) 1 At Maganwadi we steam them for two hours.
('68', 68, 4, 23, 125801) Let those who are interested in food reform from the poor mans point of view try the experiment.
('68', 68, 4, 24, 125898) It should be remembered that
('68', 68, 5, 25, 125927) 1 The source has after.
('68', 69, 0, 1, 125951) 70 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('68', 69, 1, 2, 125992) soya beans are a most nutritious diet.
('68', 69, 1, 3, 126031) It stands at the top of all the known articles of diet because of its low percentage of carbohydrates and high percentage of salts, protein and fat.
('68', 69, 1, 4, 126180) Its energy value is 2, 100 calories per lb.
('68', 69, 1, 5, 126224) against 1,750 of wheat and 1,530 of gram.
('68', 69, 1, 6, 126266) It contains 40 per cent of protein and 20.3 per cent of fat against 19 and 4.3 respectively of gram and 14.8 and 10.5 of eggs.
('68', 69, 1, 7, 126393) Therefore no one should take soya beans in addition to the usual protein and fatty foods.
('68', 69, 1, 8, 126483) The quantity, therefore, of wheat and ghee should be reduced and dal omitted altogether, soya beans being themselves a highly nutritious dal.
('68', 69, 1, 9, 126625) We are just now trying the Manchurian variety.
('68', 69, 1, 10, 126672) The Baroda beans we have not tried.
('68', 69, 1, 11, 126708) Maganwadi has its own crop of soya beans.
('68', 69, 1, 12, 126750) I hope to report the quality of Indian varieties from a laymans point of view as they come under my observation.
('68', 69, 1, 13, 126863) Those who have Indian varieties are requested to send me samples with prices.

('68', 69, 3, 15, 126961) 86. SIMPLE CURE FOR SCORPION STINGS
('68', 69, 4, 16, 126997) Shri M.S. Narayanan who is a retired engineer writes the following letter 1: The caution Shri Narayanan gives is worthy of him.
('68', 69, 4, 17, 127125) 2 He is devoting his savings and his time and skill to village reconstruction principally through khadi.
('68', 69, 4, 18, 127230) Though Maganwadi has a fair share of scorpions, the cases are nothing so frequent as Shri Narayanan has.
('68', 69, 4, 19, 127335) I have no reason to doubt his testimony.
('68', 69, 4, 20, 127376) I must not therefore keep this costless remedy from the public for fear of its proving a failure.
('68', 69, 4, 21, 127474) Those who will try the cure will please report the results of their observations.
('68', 69, 4, 22, 127556) If I have reports only of failures, the public shall know them.
('68', 69, 4, 23, 127620) Let those who will try the cure prepare the solution in the manner prescribed.
('68', 69, 5, 24, 127699) Harijan, 19 10 1935
('68', 69, 6, 25, 127719) 1 Not reproduced here.
('68', 69, 6, 26, 127742) The correspondent, a social worker, had suggested a simple remedy for scorpion stings : Make a saturated solution of common salt, allow it to settle for a day and decant the clean solution.
('68', 69, 6, 27, 127932) A drop of this solution put into each eye removes the pain of the sting instantaneously. 2 The correspondent had written that after local tests you may give the information to the rest of the world.

('68', 70, 1, 2, 128176) 87. NOT PATCHWORK
('68', 70, 2, 3, 128194) A correspondent whose earnestness is unmistakable wrote some time ago a long, very long letter declaiming against the anti untouchability campaign and the methods adopted by the Harijan Sevak Sangh to combat the evil.
('68', 70, 2, 4, 128412) He called it all patchwork.
('68', 70, 2, 5, 128440) The letter lay in my file for several weeks, always making room for something which I then considered more important and pressing.
('68', 70, 2, 6, 128571) With great difficulty I have reduced the letter to readable compass.
('68', 70, 2, 7, 128640) Here it is:
('68', 70, 3, 8, 128652) I hold that your programme re: untouchability is misconceived for the following reasons: You presume that untouchability is nine tenths of the ills of Harijans and its removal the only cure.
('68', 70, 3, 9, 128843) You feel it a social and religious curse.
('68', 70, 3, 10, 128885) I respectfully disagree with you.
('68', 70, 3, 11, 128919) I hold the whole trouble is directly economic.
('68', 70, 3, 12, 128966) Social and religious aspects that have gained ascendancy in the public view only serve the purpose of sugar coating.
('68', 70, 3, 13, 129083) We have been long trained by our ancestors (who knew the proper clue to it) to close our eyes to the bitter pill inside, but it mocks at us grimly in all its naked truth.
('68', 70, 3, 14, 129254) I believe that untouchability is bound to disappear along with the disappearance of the inferiority complex of the Harijan.
('68', 70, 3, 15, 129378) Remove the causee of his poverty, improve his economic conditions, fight for a more equitable distribution of national wealth, make the Harijan feel that he has to revolt against the existing capitalistic exploitation; then a panoramic view of his future will be opened to him and he will then need no outside agency to count the steps of his progress and caution halt at measured intervals.
('68', 70, 4, 16, 129770) You believe untouchability is peculiar to Hindu society and confined to our own land.
('68', 70, 4, 17, 129856) But my view is totally different.
('68', 70, 4, 18, 129890) It is a universal problem facing every land and the Harijan that inhabits it.
('68', 70, 4, 19, 129968) So the solution to root out this evil must be one which is common to all lands, and which goes to the root of the matter, and one ought not to be satisfied only with lopping off the topmost branches.
('68', 70, 4, 20, 130168) After all, what is untouchability?
('68', 70, 4, 21, 130203) It is treating a whole race of men as lepers and denying the elementary rights to them.
('68', 70, 4, 22, 130291) Mere touching or not touching is just a symbol and a symptom of the corroding disease, viz., subjection, and matters little or nothing to the victim so long as the main cancer is not sought to be removed.
('68', 70, 4, 23, 130496) In this view, untouchability is a universal menace and all oppressed peoples have got to rebel against it.
('68', 70, 4, 24, 130603) It has taken various guises in various countries with difference in degree.
('68', 70, 4, 25, 130679) Everywhere, its basis is economic which is miscalled political.
('68', 70, 4, 26, 130743) Indian untouchability arose, I believe, out of the conquest of Aryans over the so called Aborigines to whom the present day Harijan has to trace his ancestry.
('68', 71, 0, 1, 130902) 72 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('68', 71, 1, 2, 130943) American untouchability towards the Negroes is rooted in the land greed of the white man who first travelled to America in the Mayflower.
('68', 71, 1, 3, 131081) The Hitlerian hatred of the Jew, the Bolsheviks hatred of the bourgeoisie, the Chinamans fear of the Mikado are all traceable to the same source, viz., economic exploitation, euphemistically called Politics.
('68', 71, 1, 4, 131289) The Indian asprishyata, the American lynching, the Belgian Congo, the Nazian persecution of the Jews are outstanding examples of this injustice, and world wars are their natural culmination.
('68', 71, 2, 5, 131480) Again untouchability or, to speak more correctly, the inferiority complex of the conquered original owners of this land, was a bourgeoi political necessity of the Aryans for keeping the comparatively inferior races of the Harijans under eternal subjection solely for economic ends, that is, for permanently maintaining the superiority in status of the conqueror over the conquered.
('68', 71, 2, 6, 131862) The much advertised I.C.S. steelframe superiority, the recent uncouth reminder to the African Negro chief Tesh Kendy by his European masters, the preferential treatment claimed [by] and conceded to those of European extraction are but living reminders of this hiatus which have been carefully conceived to enable smaller but more powerful nations to exploit bigger but weaker peoples.
('68', 71, 3, 7, 132247) This explains and greatly probabilizes the imposition, for economic ends, of cruel disabilities by the conquering Aryan hordes over the vanquished forces of the sons of the soil.
('68', 71, 3, 8, 132426) Then followed as night did the day the engine of ruthless suppression, and every effort was made to introduce and establish this racial superiority in matters of residence, association, eating and drinking and in every walk of life.
('68', 71, 3, 9, 132659) Poets sang praises of this system and Puranas sealed it with divine approval.
('68', 71, 3, 10, 132737) The Harijan, like the Natal Indian, was feared in commercial competition, too, and there came the law ousting him from main business centres and important thriving trades.
('68', 71, 3, 11, 132909) The impoverished Harijan reduced to mere manual labour became half naked, huddled in huts, developed insanitation and illiteracy and, to use Arnolds language, bowed low and let the storm to pass.
('68', 71, 3, 12, 133105) He had of course to pay the penalty for being a conquered nation, as others do.
('68', 71, 4, 13, 133185) You do not believe in the existence of class struggle and are not prepared to unseat those owners of the so called vested interests for the mere reason that their status quo ought not to be disturbed.
('68', 71, 4, 14, 133386) You refuse to recognize that the interests of the capitalists and the labourers are bound to clash with each other so long as the inequality in their present position is approved and sought to be maintained.
('68', 71, 5, 15, 133594) The Harijan asks for bread but a stone is your answer.
('68', 71, 5, 16, 133649) For aught I know about the Harijan, he is least concerned about his touch me not trouble.
('68', 71, 5, 17, 133739) I am sure you realize that the Harijans untouchability is too deep to be removed by an occasional inter dining, demonstrative sweeping in the slums, ceremonious entries into the village temples and merciful distribution of
('68', 72, 0, 1, 133962) VOL. 68 : 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 73
('68', 72, 1, 2, 134007) clothing and sweetmeats, which seem to be the type design programme that is chalked out for the much tired Congressman.
('68', 72, 1, 3, 134127) To all appearance, the programme seems to go on merrily.
('68', 72, 1, 4, 134184) Details of boys holding scholarships in the till recently banned schools, instances of temples and wells thrown open, are tabulated in Harijan, but what strikes me most pointedly is: Is the Harijan going to bee satisfied with all this?
('68', 72, 1, 5, 134420) Can we say that he is on the shortest road to his salvation?
('68', 72, 1, 6, 134481) I would only wonder what the response would be if the public are asked to give better wages for shorter hours of work and do their duty by the impoverished Harijan.
('68', 72, 2, 7, 134646) To be true to you, I feel compelled to state that the too much stress you have laid on this comparatively minor problem, in preference to their more vital needs, leads the Harijans to self deception, binds them to the chariot wheel of capitalistic exploitation, and puts off indefinitely the day of their economic freedom, which their brethren in other countries are striving hard to secure.
('68', 72, 2, 8, 135038) Such argument was heard when I was touring in the South in the Harijan interest.
('68', 72, 2, 9, 135119) It is well, however, to have it summed up in a letter.
('68', 72, 2, 10, 135174) The mistake the correspondent makes is in thinking that the struggle against untouchability ends with the remonval of touch pollution.
('68', 72, 2, 11, 135309) The campaign had to begin with the removal of the impassable religious bar.
('68', 72, 2, 12, 135385) Those who come under the religious ban are a class apart.
('68', 72, 2, 13, 135443) To them the taint attaches by birth.
('68', 72, 2, 14, 135480) Who does not know that these men though they may be economically well off are still treated as social lepers?
('68', 72, 2, 15, 135590) Thousands of Ezhawas in Travancore and Namosudras in Bengal are very well off and yet to their great sorrow and to the equally great disgrace of the so called savarna Hindus, the formers possession of the good things of the earth makes no difference in their social status.
('68', 72, 2, 16, 135864) There is no difficulty in admitting that much will remain to be done after the bar sinister is removed.
('68', 72, 2, 17, 135968) Indeed it is the recognition of this obvious fact that has impelled the Harijan Sevak Sangh to handle educational and economic work among Harijans which the correspondent seems to be little.
('68', 72, 2, 18, 136159) That work serves the Harijans tangibly and tests the sincerity of the reformers and brings them in close touch with those whom they are out to serve.
('68', 72, 2, 19, 136309) When untouchability is altogether gone, Harijans will share the benefit with the others of the economic uplift that is silently but surely going on.
('68', 72, 2, 20, 136458) Harijans contribute, say, 16 per cent of the total population of India.
('68', 72, 2, 21, 136530) But those who suffer from economic exploitation form at least 90 per cent of the population.
('68', 72, 2, 22, 136623) It is for that reason that I have said
('68', 73, 0, 1, 136662) 74 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('68', 73, 1, 2, 136703) in these columns that the missions of the A.I.S.A., A.I.V.I.A. and Harijan Sevak Sangh are inter related, and that is why the scope of Harijan has been extended.
('68', 73, 1, 3, 136865) The correspondent is wrong in suggesting that I do not believe in the existence of class struggle.
('68', 73, 1, 4, 136964) What I do not believe in is the necessity of fomenting and keeping it up.
('68', 73, 1, 5, 137038) I entertain a growing belief that it is perfectly possible to aviod it.
('68', 73, 1, 6, 137110) There is no virtue in fomenting it, as there is in preventing it.
('68', 73, 1, 7, 137176) The conflict between moneyed classes and labourers is merely seeming.
('68', 73, 1, 8, 137246) When labour is intelligent enough to organize itself and learns to act as one man, it will have the same weight as money if not much greater.
('68', 73, 1, 9, 137388) The conflict is really between intelligence and unintelligence.
('68', 73, 1, 10, 137452) Surely it will be folly to keep up such a conflict.
('68', 73, 1, 11, 137504) Unintelligence must be removed.
('68', 73, 1, 12, 137536) Money has its use as much as labour.
('68', 73, 1, 13, 137573) After all money is a token of exchange.
('68', 73, 1, 14, 137613) A person having 25 rupees has, say, 50 labourers per day at his disposal, regarding eight annas as the wage for a day of eight hours.
('68', 73, 1, 15, 137747) A labourer who has 49 fellow labourers working in unison with him is even with the person who has Rs. 25. The advantage, if any, will be with the one who has monopoly of labour.
('68', 73, 1, 16, 137925) If both are even there will be harmony.
('68', 73, 1, 17, 137965) The problem therefore is not to set class against class, but to educate labour to a sense of its dignity.
('68', 73, 1, 18, 138071) Moneyed men after all form a microscopic minority in the world.
('68', 73, 1, 19, 138135) They will act on the square, immediately labour realizes its power and yet acts on the square.
('68', 73, 1, 20, 138230) To inflame labour against moneyed men is to perpetuate class hatred and all the evil consequences flowing from it.
('68', 73, 1, 21, 138345) The strife is a vicious circle to be avoided at any cost.
('68', 73, 1, 22, 138403) It is an admission of weakness, a sign of inferiority complex.
('68', 73, 1, 23, 138466) The moment labour recognizes its own dignity, money will find its rightful place, i.e., it will be held in trust for labour.
('68', 73, 1, 24, 138591) For labour is more than money.

('68', 73, 4, 27, 138664) I gladly publish the following letter 1 from the Principal, Sanatan Dharma College, Lahore: There can be no doubt that there must be a relentless war waged against this vice.
('68', 73, 4, 28, 138839) I have gone through the gruesome reports enclosed with this letter.
('68', 73, 4, 29, 138907) These are of a different type from those dealt with by
('68', 73, 5, 30, 138962) 1 This is not reproduced here.

('68', 74, 1, 2, 139038) me in the articles 1 to which the Principal refers.
('68', 74, 1, 3, 139090) They had reference to cases exclusively of seduction by teachers.
('68', 74, 1, 4, 139156) The reports now sent mostly deal with cases of unnatural assaults committed by goondas on boys of tender age and then murdered.
('68', 74, 1, 5, 139284) Though the cases of unnatural assaults followed by murder appear more hidious, I believe that they are more capable of being dealt with than the cases in which boys become willing victims of their teachers.
('68', 74, 1, 6, 139491) Both require incessant vigilance by the reformer and the rousing of public conscience against the commission of this disgusting crime.
('68', 74, 1, 7, 139626) It is the duty of leaders in the Punjab, in which this crime seems to flourish most, to get together, irrespective of race or creed, and devise methods of protecting the youth of the land of five rivers from criminals whether as seducers or ravishers and murderers.
('68', 74, 1, 8, 139892) It is no use passing resolutions condemning the criminals.
('68', 74, 1, 9, 139951) All crimes are different kinds of diseases and they should be treated as such by the reformers.
('68', 74, 1, 10, 140047) That does not mean that the police will suspend their function of regarding such cases as public crimes, but their measures are never intended to deal with causes of these social disturbances.
('68', 74, 1, 11, 140240) To do so is the special prerogative of the reformer.
('68', 74, 1, 12, 140293) And unless the moral tone of society is raised, in spite of whatever may be written in the newspapers such crimes will flourish, if only for the simple reason that the moral sense of these perverts had become blunt and they rarely read newspapers, especially those portions which contain fervent exhortation against such vices.
('68', 74, 1, 13, 140621) The only effective way I can conceive of, therefore, is for some enthusiastic reformers like the Principal of the Sanatan Dharma College, if he is one, to gather together other reformers and take concerted measures to deal with the evil.

('68', 75, 2, 3, 141413) MAGANWADI, (WARDHA), October 19, 1935
('68', 75, 3, 4, 141451) MY DEAR MALKANI,
('68', 75, 4, 5, 141468) There is no such good news for you or for me.
('68', 75, 4, 6, 141514) I don't stir out of Wardha till the end of the year.
('68', 75, 4, 7, 141567) January has been mortgaged to Gujarat, and February will probably be given to Delhi.
('68', 75, 4, 8, 141652) The Sangh 1Council will meet here in November, I expect.
('68', 75, 4, 9, 141709) But do not expect me to go either to Calcutta or to Bangalore next year.
('68', 75, 4, 10, 141782) I do not want to devote the whole year to travelling.
('68', 75, 4, 11, 141836) There is much work to be done here.
('68', 75, 4, 12, 141872) It is with the utmost reluctance that I have undertaken to go to Gujarat.
('68', 75, 4, 13, 141946) One month to Delhi I will have to give.
('68', 75, 4, 14, 141986) You may expect no congratulations; but you will certainly deserve them for having built at such a reasonable cost, and from the details you have sent, I see that everything was worked out most thoughtfully.
('68', 75, 4, 15, 142193) You won't have Amtul Salaam before next year and you might not have Viyogi Hari either.
('68', 75, 4, 16, 142281) With love,
('68', 75, 5, 17, 142292) Yours, BAPU

('68', 75, 8, 20, 142361) October 19, 1935
('68', 75, 9, 21, 142378) CHANDU,
('68', 75, 10, 22, 142386) I got your letter of the 9th.
('68', 75, 10, 23, 142416) I like it very much.
('68', 75, 10, 24, 142437) It is a frank one.
('68', 75, 10, 25, 142456) Kishorelalbhai had written everything with the purest of motives.
('68', 75, 10, 26, 142522) He used to speak in Shankar's favour when I was prejudiced against him.
('68', 75, 10, 27, 142594) He was shaken in his confidence by the .
('68', 75, 10, 28, 142635) 2 episode, but your letter to him made him wonder again whether Shankar might not be right in his belief.
('68', 75, 10, 29, 142741) Hence with the aim of discovering the truth and because you had permitted him, he put you more questions.
('68', 75, 10, 30, 142847) There was thus no

('68', 76, 1, 2, 142961) reason for you to feel offended with him.
('68', 76, 1, 3, 143003) But now your letter to me closes that chapter.
('68', 76, 1, 4, 143050) I am still meeting Nanabhai 1. .
('68', 76, 1, 5, 143083) will return.
('68', 76, 1, 6, 143096) I will of course still need your help.
('68', 76, 1, 7, 143135) I will not put you to the trouble of coming here while you are taking rest.
('68', 76, 1, 8, 143211) You may certainly stay with your brother and his wife for some time and recoup yourself.
('68', 76, 1, 9, 143300) When your stay is over, I may suggest your coming over here before going to Vartej.
('68', 76, 1, 10, 143384) I think it will be necessary to do so.
('68', 76, 1, 11, 143423) And if you wish, I shall send a reliable person to escort you.
('68', 76, 1, 12, 143486) If anything occurs to you meanwhile, write to me.
('68', 76, 1, 13, 143536) Is there any other girl, besides you two sisters, who can throw light on this chapter?
('68', 76, 1, 14, 143623) If there is, give me her name and address.
('68', 76, 1, 15, 143666) If there is anyone else also who is in a position to help, let me know.

('68', 76, 4, 18, 143827) 92. ABOUT SNAKE BITES
('68', 76, 5, 19, 143849) I give below a summary in my words of the questions put by a Harijan reader and my answers:
('68', 76, 6, 20, 143941) Q. Is there any risk involved in making vertical and horizontal cuts over a [snake ] bite?
('68', 76, 6, 21, 144032) And, if there is any, is it proper to invite one risk in order to avoid another?
('68', 76, 7, 22, 144113) A. There is no risk at all in making a cut over the bite.
('68', 76, 7, 23, 144171) It would have been easier to follow if the translator had used the word 'incision' instead of cut.
('68', 76, 7, 24, 144270) The only purpose of making an incision is to drain some blood out.
('68', 76, 7, 25, 144337) Such superficial incision does not hurt much; and anyone who has been bitten does not feel the pain at all and because he gradually tends to lose consciousness the cells in his brain become so insensitive that he has little awareness of what his body is being subjected to.
('68', 76, 8, 26, 144611) Q. Please explain clearly how the tender skin covering the bones escapes injury.
('68', 76, 9, 27, 144692) A. The previous passage explains this.
('68', 76, 9, 28, 144731) The razor's edge does not reach the bone while making an incision.
('68', 76, 9, 29, 144798) Instead of the skin we should think of layers.
('68', 76, 9, 30, 144845) We should imagine that there are layers
('68', 76, 10, 31, 144885) 1 Nrisinhaprasad Kalidas Bhatt, founder of the Lokbharati
('68', 77, 0, 1, 144943) 78 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('68', 77, 1, 2, 144984) beneath the skin which we can see and touch.
('68', 77, 1, 3, 145029) The incision which has to be made is just to open up the skin.
('68', 77, 1, 4, 145092) In that case the edge of the knife cannot even reach the layer of the skin immediately next to the bone.
('68', 77, 2, 5, 145197) Q. What is meant by "using the blade of the safety razor after passing it over a flame"?
('68', 77, 3, 6, 145286) A. The blade should be passed back and forth over a lighted match until the latter burns out.
('68', 77, 3, 7, 145380) This would take only a few seconds.
('68', 77, 4, 8, 145416) Q. Is there no danger of death to the person who sucks [the poison]?
('68', 77, 5, 9, 145485) A. If he has no ulcers in his mouth, there is no danger of death or of any other harm.
('68', 77, 5, 10, 145572) If he has ulcers, there is no question of his sucking.
('68', 77, 6, 11, 145627) Q. You write of mud pack remedies, but you cannot give any assurances.
('68', 77, 7, 12, 145698) A. I can give no guarantee whatsoever.
('68', 77, 7, 13, 145737) Moreover, who will permit me to make sufficient number of experiments to give any assurance?
('68', 77, 8, 14, 145830) Q. The sixth question is that I should have written 1
('68', 77, 9, 15, 145884) exhaustively about identifying the different kinds of snakes.
('68', 77, 10, 16, 145946) A. Nothing is gained by putting before the reader something which I find it difficult to understand because even if I understood, it cannot help me in identifying the kinds.
('68', 77, 10, 17, 146120) Those who [want to] understand this matter more than I do ought to obtain the literature for themselves and go through it; this literature can generally be found in libraries.
('68', 77, 10, 18, 146296) Finally, I may add that I am collecting further knowledge about snake bites and if I find anything more valuable, I shall certainly inform the readers.
('68', 77, 10, 19, 146448) An experienced doctor, who is an old friend, writes to say that there is no likelihood of anything new and worth communicating coming to light.
('68', 77, 10, 20, 146592) I may say that Ramanama is the remedy for a bite by a venomous cobra.
('68', 77, 10, 21, 146662) Luckily, such cobras are few.
('68', 77, 10, 22, 146692) There is little danger of death if the other bites are treated immediately in the manner suggested.

('68', 78, 1, 2, 146914) 93. TWO QUESTIONS
('68', 78, 2, 3, 146932) Many questions keep coming up about the new policy of the Spinner's Association, which is being framed.
('68', 78, 2, 4, 147036) Here are some of them:
('68', 78, 3, 5, 147059) Q. 1. How can workers prepare themselves to put into effect the new policy?
('68', 78, 3, 6, 147135) The best way is for those who have grown accustomed to the new policy to train workers from among villagers and persons who do not know English.
('68', 78, 3, 7, 147280) We shall need innumerable workers if the policy of self sufficing [khadi] is to be made widespread.
('68', 78, 3, 8, 147380) This poor country cannot afford them salaries if these happen to be large.
('68', 78, 3, 9, 147455) If workers are trained only from amongst the English educated persons they would demand large salaries as their needs have increased.
('68', 78, 3, 10, 147589) They no longer possess a hardy constitution.
('68', 78, 3, 11, 147634) And, in a sphere where a knowledge of the English language is not essential they cannot be said to be particularly useful.
('68', 78, 3, 12, 147757) Very often, their usefulness has indeed inclined.
('68', 78, 3, 13, 147807) For instance, they do not like living in villages and they try to import city life into the villages.
('68', 78, 3, 14, 147909) Their bodies are less supple and only in rare cases can they become skilled craftsmen.
('68', 78, 3, 15, 147996) Even when they learn a craft, they can seldom compete with ordinary craftsmen.
('68', 78, 3, 16, 148075) I only want to suggest here that we should give up the craze of looking for workers who know English.
('68', 78, 3, 17, 148177) This does not mean that we should boycott or despite those who know English.
('68', 78, 3, 18, 148254) We should welcome any such person who is available.
('68', 78, 3, 19, 148306) They are all right where they belong.
('68', 78, 3, 20, 148344) The only purpose of saying this is to rid ourselves of the false notion that only those who know English are fit to be workers.
('68', 78, 3, 21, 148472) If a village worker's services are available, he will bring in greater returns than the amount paid to him.
('68', 78, 3, 22, 148580) An allowance of not more than Rs. 10 to 15 should be required for such a worker.
('68', 78, 3, 23, 148661) And he can easily bring in by way of return that amount every month.
('68', 78, 3, 24, 148730) Organizers should train such workers wherever there are khadi centres and to that extent enlarge their field of work.
('68', 78, 3, 25, 148848) Workers should acquaint themselves with all the processes starting from growing cotton right up to making khadi.
('68', 78, 3, 26, 148961) And if those who are in charge of these centres are themselves efficient, they can readily produce such workers at no cost.
('68', 78, 3, 27, 149085) At present, I do not visualize any separate institution for training workers.
('68', 78, 4, 28, 149163) Q. 2. Will the number of private traders increase or decrease with the
('68', 78, 5, 29, 149234) implementation of the new policy?
('68', 79, 0, 1, 149268) 80 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('68', 79, 1, 2, 149309) There cannot be any increase in the number of private traders.
('68', 79, 1, 3, 149372) Making [khadi] self sufficing will be the principal policy.
('68', 79, 1, 4, 149432) Private traders have no place in it.
('68', 79, 1, 5, 149469) They will cotinue for the purpose of selling khadi in the cities.
('68', 79, 1, 6, 149535) There is very little likelihood of there being an increase in their numbers because, with the growing desire of craftsmen to add to their earnings, private traders will progressively decrease in number.
('68', 79, 1, 7, 149738) This is because the latter are impelled by the profit motive.
('68', 79, 1, 8, 149800) Hence they will not be satisfied.
('68', 79, 1, 9, 149834) In the new scheme, the ceilling to the seller's earnings will be fixed and whatever profit is there, will go to the craftsmen.

('68', 79, 10, 22, 150574) I won't send him to you.
('68', 79, 10, 23, 150599) The desire for degrees is becoming universal at present.
('68', 79, 10, 24, 150656) How, then, can we blame Sharda 2 and Vijaya 3?
('68', 79, 10, 25, 150703) Let them satisfy their desire.

('68', 80, 1, 4, 150968) I can't recall his face.
('68', 80, 1, 5, 150993) I was pained and surprised to read about Jamnadas.
('68', 80, 1, 6, 151044) He had given me a firm assurance here.
('68', 80, 1, 7, 151083) Really speaking the money collected during the Charkha Week 1
('68', 80, 2, 8, 151145) should be utilized in promoting khadi activities.

('68', 80, 2, 13, 151435) After I leave in January, she is bound to feel unhappy.
('68', 80, 2, 14, 151491) Let us see what happens.
('68', 80, 2, 15, 151516) Mirabehn recovered long ago.

('68', 80, 2, 18, 151648) He is steadily improving.
('68', 80, 2, 19, 151674) But he will take some time to recover completely.
('68', 80, 2, 20, 151724) Ghanshyamdas has kept him at his place.
('68', 80, 2, 21, 151764) I am sending herewith a letter from Jethalal Joshi.
('68', 80, 2, 22, 151816) Have you relieved Pranjivan Joshi?

('68', 80, 6, 31, 152124) October 20, 1935
('68', 80, 7, 32, 152141) Mahatma Gandhi said that it was no fault of the religion that Dr. Ambedkar was going to make himself a convert.
('68', 80, 7, 33, 152253) 4 Caste Hindus and Harijans had a common religion.
('68', 80, 7, 34, 152304) The enmity between those two parties was no sufficient reason for him to go against

('68', 81, 1, 3, 152967) Dr. Ambedkar and Harijans might go against the caste Hindus and fight for their equality.
('68', 81, 1, 4, 153057) It was a fact that the Harijans were molested by the caste Hindus at Kavitha.
('68', 81, 1, 5, 153135) It should not be the case that from some such stray instances of harassment, men like Dr. Ambedkar should go against the religion.
('68', 81, 1, 6, 153266) The Harijans of Kavitha might leave the place and go to other places where they would get the necessary environment to pull on.
('68', 81, 1, 7, 153394) If Dr. Ambedkar was converted, many men from the depressed classes would not follow him.
('68', 81, 1, 8, 153483) Anyhow the Muslim fold was thought to be a suitable place to go into.
('68', 81, 1, 9, 153553) The Muslims would not be able to take many depressed classes in their fold; for they would not be able to manage them.
('68', 81, 1, 10, 153672) Moreover, he said that the water tight compartment of untouchability had been already loosened through the efforts to the Harijan Sevak Sangh and others.
('68', 81, 1, 11, 153826) In such circumstances Dr. Ambedkar's threat to change his religion only showed that he was impatient and no one was able to help him in such a situation.

('68', 81, 5, 15, 154046) MY DEAR AMRIT,
('68', 81, 6, 16, 154061) The longer you stay in Simla, the gladder I feel.
('68', 81, 6, 17, 154111) Now that the giddy season there is over, you get a change of having a little bit of rest.
('68', 81, 6, 18, 154201) I fancy that now is the real season for Simlaquiet and bracing.
('68', 81, 6, 19, 154265) There need be no hurry to descend to Jullundur.
('68', 81, 6, 20, 154313) The work won't run away from you, if you go there a little later.
('68', 81, 6, 21, 154379) Pray do not worry over my estimate 1 of your brochure on the position of women in India.
('68', 81, 6, 22, 154468) The matter is all right it is the manner which appeared to me to be defective.
('68', 81, 6, 23, 154547) I could smell your fatigue and midnight oilmust one say now midnight electric burnersin it.
('68', 81, 6, 24, 154639) I did not miss the political part.
('68', 81, 6, 25, 154674) It was not expected there.
('68', 81, 6, 26, 154701) But of all this when we meet, if only that will bring you here earlier.
('68', 81, 6, 27, 154773) Nor need you worry about Devdas not having been completely cured there.
('68', 81, 6, 28, 154845) Dr. Ansari is more than satisfied.
('68', 81, 6, 29, 154880) The weather in Delhi is quite good now and Devdas is accommodated in a nice house.
('68', 81, 6, 30, 154963) Pyarelal is no longer with him all the 24 hours.
('68', 81, 6, 31, 155012) Devdas says nowhere could he have had greater kindness than under your roof.

('68', 82, 7, 8, 155339) I get your letters.
('68', 82, 7, 9, 155359) Don't expect long or regular letters from me.
('68', 82, 7, 10, 155405) I certainly wish to write, but being in the Committee I get no time at all.
('68', 82, 7, 11, 155481) I am glad that you keep good health.
('68', 82, 7, 12, 155518) I don't know how long I shall have to stay here.
('68', 82, 7, 13, 155567) I see that I shall have to do some travelling, unless indeed I have to go there immediately for some reason.
('68', 82, 7, 14, 155676) I am quite well.
('68', 82, 7, 15, 155693) I intentionally avoid writing with my right hand.

('68', 82, 12, 21, 155905) October 22, 1935
('68', 82, 13, 22, 155922) As today's menu was selected by me with some careful thought, and especially with a view to the needs of village workers, I must speak to you about it at some length.
('68', 82, 13, 23, 156089) The idea was to provide you with food, nourishing and yet within the means of an average villager and within the possibility of an eight hours' minimum wage as we have fixed it, i.e., three annas.
('68', 82, 13, 24, 156286) We were 98 diners today and the total cost of our food was Rs. 9 14 3, which means that each meal cost slightly more than six pice.
('68', 82, 13, 25, 156418) Here are the details:
('68', 82, 14, 26, 156440) 1 As summarized by Mahadev Desai.
('68', 82, 14, 27, 156474) The workers had undergone a fortnight's study course from October 8 to 22.

('68', 83, 14, 15, 156825) Vinoba had passed on the suggestion to me that I need not worry about giving all of you roti 1 but might simply give you wheaten porridge (that we have here every morning) and thus save a lot of trouble.
('68', 83, 14, 16, 157029) No, said I to myself, you young men whom God has given strong teeth must have good hard well baked bhakhari 2, which anyone can make, which one can easily carry on one's person from place to place and which can keep for a couple of days.
('68', 83, 14, 17, 157267) Before the dough was kneaded it was treated with linseed oil.
('68', 83, 14, 18, 157329) This rendered it both soft and crisp.
('68', 83, 14, 19, 157367) Then, as we must have some greens and raw vegetables, we had tomatoes and two chutneysone made of koth fruit available in plenty in these parts and another made of leaves available in our garden.
('68', 83, 14, 20, 157563) Koth fruit is known for both its aperient and astringent properties, and jaggery goes well with it and makes a delicious chutney.
('68', 83, 14, 21, 157693) The other chutney contained some cocoanut, tamarind and salt to spice the leaves.
('68', 83, 14, 22, 157775) Green leaves must be eaten by us in some form on other, in order what we may get proper vitamins in our diet.
('68', 83, 14, 23, 157885) The vegetable chosen was the cheapest available and grows everywhere in our villages.
('68', 83, 14, 24, 157971) You will see that I allowed the use of tamarind in the preparation of chutney.
('68', 83, 14, 25, 158050) In spite of the popular prejudice against tamarind, it has been found that it is a good aperient and blood purifier.
('68', 83, 14, 26, 158167) I gave copious doses of tamarind water to one of the inmates suffering from malaria with very good effect and have tried it in

('68', 84, 1, 2, 158363) several cases of constipation.
('68', 84, 1, 3, 158394) Milk is an essential article of diet.
('68', 84, 1, 4, 158432) Your menu contained half a pound of milk, but you must have seen that I gave you no ghee.
('68', 84, 1, 5, 158522) I hope, however, that you did not miss it.
('68', 84, 1, 6, 158565) For I gave you soya beans and oil.
('68', 84, 1, 7, 158600) Soya beans are rich in oil (20 per cent) and proteins (40 per cent).
('68', 84, 1, 8, 158669) Ground nuts also are rich in oil, but they have the disadvantage of containing too much starch from which soya beans are comparatively free.
('68', 84, 1, 9, 158810) Milk with soya beans gives us almost all that we need in the shape of fats and there is no need for ghee at all.
('68', 84, 1, 10, 158923) Why then go to all the wasteful trouble of making ghee.
('68', 84, 1, 11, 158979) And where procuring good ghee is a doubtful proposition, why have spurious ghee?
('68', 84, 1, 12, 159060) But milk or buttermilk we ought to have, no matter how little.
('68', 84, 1, 13, 159123) Medical men say that it helps in the assimilation of the vegetable fats and proteids.
('68', 84, 1, 14, 159209) Therefore ghee you can omit with impunity.
('68', 84, 1, 15, 159252) I had recently two little children under my care whose diet I carefully regulated.
('68', 84, 1, 16, 159335) I cut out ghee from it and found that they were none the worse for the cutting out of ghee.
('68', 84, 1, 17, 159427) Of course I gave them as much milk as they wanted.
('68', 84, 1, 18, 159478) Our menu has cost us a little more than six pice.
('68', 84, 1, 19, 159528) It was a full meal and the other meals need not be so heavy as this.
('68', 84, 1, 20, 159597) They, therefore, need not cost more than an anna or so.
('68', 84, 1, 21, 159653) Milk may be omitted for the other meals.
('68', 84, 1, 22, 159694) Wheat bhakhari, soya bean and chutney should be quite enough.
('68', 84, 1, 23, 159756) So this is one of the two main things you have to doto ensure to villagers a balanced diet, and to content yourselves with the same.
('68', 84, 1, 24, 159889) There may be some who burden their diet with useless articles and many whose diet is badly deficient in vitamins.
('68', 84, 1, 25, 160003) You have to introduce the right kind of diet to them.
('68', 84, 1, 26, 160057) You will learn cow keeping yourselves and encourage cow keeping among villagers.
('68', 84, 1, 27, 160138) It ought to be considered a shame that milk is not available in many of our villages.
('68', 84, 1, 28, 160224) The second main duty is sanitationa most difficult thing indeed.
('68', 84, 1, 29, 160289) But if you have succeeded in introducing the right kind of diet and making the sanitation of your village tolerably good, you will have rendered human bodies worthy of becoming temples of God and efficient tools for doing a good day's work.
('68', 84, 1, 30, 160530) Khadi will certainly occupy the centre of the village industries.
('68', 84, 1, 31, 160596) But remember that we have to concentrate on making the villages self sufficing in khadi.
('68', 84, 1, 32, 160685) Out of self sufficing khadi will follow commercial khadi as a matter of course.
('68', 84, 1, 33, 160765) The argument you will find elaborated in the columns of Harijan.
('68', 84, 1, 34, 160830) But on you will depend the success of failure
('68', 85, 0, 1, 160876) 86 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('68', 85, 1, 2, 160917) of khadi.
('68', 85, 1, 3, 160927) People have been frightened by baseless scares.
('68', 85, 1, 4, 160975) You have to restore their faith in khadi and explain to them the new policy.
('68', 85, 2, 5, 161052) You will of course take up any other industry available in villages and for which you can find a market, care being taken that no shop has to be run at a loss and no article produced for which there is no market.
('68', 85, 2, 6, 161265) Give eight hours of your day to any home craft you like and show to the villagers that as you earn your wage, even so can they earn it by eight hours' work.
('68', 85, 2, 7, 161422) Make Vinoba your ideal here.
('68', 85, 2, 8, 161451) It is impossible for you to emulate his learning or to have his wonderful memory, but you can certainly emulate his industry and devotion to work.
('68', 85, 2, 9, 161598) Go not to the villages to write commentaries on the Upanishads, which you may well do in towns and cities.
('68', 85, 2, 10, 161705) Your work will provide the best commentary as does Vinoba's concentrated work.
('68', 85, 2, 11, 161784) We have to infect the villagers with our passion for work.
('68', 85, 2, 12, 161843) We say they have become hewers of wood and drawers of water 2. In order that they may stand erect and say they shall no longer be mere hewers of wood and drawers of water for us, you have to explain to them the reason for every one of their actions and make them voluntary workers for a living wage.
('68', 85, 2, 13, 162143) What Vinoba has done should be easier for these simple folks to achieve.
('68', 85, 2, 14, 162216) I am told a village lad called Gulab has already broken Vinoba's record in spinning.
('68', 85, 2, 15, 162301) You will also not take a companion to work with you.
('68', 85, 2, 16, 162354) Our policy is to send a single worker to a village or group of villages.
('68', 85, 2, 17, 162427) That will enable him to bring his resourcefulness into full play.
('68', 85, 2, 18, 162493) He may pick out any number of companions from the village itself.
('68', 85, 2, 19, 162559) They will work under his direction, but he will be mainly responsible for the village under his charge.
('68', 85, 2, 20, 162663) Let us not be tempted by the allurements of the machine age, let us concentrate on rendering our own body machines perfect and efficient instruments of work and let us get the best out of them.
('68', 85, 2, 21, 162857) This is your task.
('68', 85, 2, 22, 162876) Go ahead with it, without flinching.
('68', 85, 2, 23, 162913) There need be no despair in a field which Vinoba has made his own and where he has given the best of his 15 years.
('68', 85, 2, 24, 163028) I at least have no cause for despair and that is why you find me settled down here.

('68', 87, 3, 4, 164445) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('68', 87, 3, 5, 164478) Whilst the language you have chosen to describe the attitude of your co workers, including myself, is unhappy, the substance of what you say is undeniable.
('68', 87, 3, 6, 164634) There is no want of regard and affection for you.
('68', 87, 3, 7, 164684) Your great services for the country will command them at any time; but the country has adopted a faith which runs counter to that of the days when you were one of the most active workers.
('68', 87, 3, 8, 164872) I am not therefore surprised that you found the atmosphere in Madras unresponsive to your presentation of the situation and the remedy.
('68', 87, 3, 9, 165008) 1 In spite of all the desire to appreciate your viewpoint, it has not been possible to follow it here.
('68', 87, 3, 10, 165111) In my opinion there is no cause for grief or complaint.
('68', 87, 3, 11, 165167) Is it not well that although our views differ, we can retain our affection and old friendship unimpaired?
('68', 87, 3, 12, 165273) Do come by all means, whenever you have a few days to spare.

('68', 87, 8, 18, 165527) Mithubehn has sent to me your letter to your sister for my perusal.

('68', 87, 9, 22, 165798) The Committee felt that considering the long interval that would elapse before the provincial elections under the new Constitution, as well as the uncertain character of the political conditions during the period, it would be inadvisable to commit the Congress to any decision regarding office acceptance.

('68', 88, 1, 3, 166350) Do write to me sometimes.
('68', 88, 1, 4, 166376) I can see that you will find your peace of mind only by patiently enduring your suffering, and God has given you the strength to do so.
('68', 88, 1, 5, 166512) I do not therefore intend to write to you a letter of sympathy even in your illness.
('68', 88, 1, 6, 166597) Instead I wish that your God given gift of preserving your peace of mind in any and every kind of suffering should go on increasing.
('68', 88, 1, 7, 166730) Happiness and suffering are part of our lot.
('68', 88, 1, 8, 166775) Who can say with certainty that what we think to be happiness or sorrow is really so?
('68', 88, 1, 9, 166861) The best thing for us, therefore, is to be able to preserve our peace of mind in all circumstances and thank God for being able to do so.
('68', 88, 1, 10, 166999) What shall I write to you about the situation here?

('68', 88, 7, 25, 167442) PRABHUDAS,
('68', 88, 8, 26, 167453) I received your long letter.
('68', 88, 8, 27, 167482) Do not mind it being so long.
('68', 88, 8, 28, 167512) I am sending a copy of it to Shankerlal.
('68', 88, 8, 29, 167553) I would not at any time advise either you or Amba to leave Guleria.
('68', 88, 8, 30, 167621) I would regard it as humiliating for you to do so.
('68', 88, 8, 31, 167672) Your description of the three circumstances there is correct.
('68', 88, 8, 32, 167734) Till a person has spent ten years in the same village, nothing can be said as to whether he has succeeded or failed.
('68', 88, 8, 33, 167851) I simply do not believe that your stay in Guleria is failing in its purpose.
('68', 88, 8, 34, 167928) I have such blind faith in your uprightness that I have never believed that you have failed in your purpose in staying there.
('68', 88, 8, 35, 168054) Nor do I believe that you have lost anything yourself by staying there.

('68', 89, 1, 2, 168167) I am trying to get the Magan spinning wheel.
('68', 89, 1, 3, 168212) Only if I do not get it from anywhere will I send for it from you.
('68', 89, 1, 4, 168279) I am ready to buy ten thousand rupees worth of jaggery.
('68', 89, 1, 5, 168335) I will pay even a higher price.
('68', 89, 1, 6, 168367) But you should have the price fixed in advance before proceeding in the matter.
('68', 89, 1, 7, 168447) Some limit must be fixed for the price.
('68', 89, 1, 8, 168487) Unless that is done, the business cannot be carried on.
('68', 89, 1, 9, 168543) The total quantity may be divided into cubes of one pound each and the cubes may be wrapped in paper of good quality.
('68', 89, 1, 10, 168661) Do not mind if doing so increases the labour charges.
('68', 89, 1, 11, 168715) I will certainly be able to obtain for it a price upto a certain limit.
('68', 89, 1, 12, 168787) I understand what you say regarding the saree.

('68', 89, 6, 20, 169155) You sent a girl into our family.
('68', 89, 6, 21, 169188) You have now taken a girl into your family.
('68', 89, 6, 22, 169232) As Sushila and Manilal make each other happy, even so may Surendra and Manu do.
('68', 89, 6, 23, 169312) Manu is a submissive and simple hearted girl, delicate in health.
('68', 89, 6, 24, 169378) I do not think she would have felt as secure in any other family as she will be in yours and with Surendra.

('68', 90, 4, 5, 169977) How could I, of course, expect you to write to me?
('68', 90, 4, 6, 170028) But even so I often thought of you.
('68', 90, 4, 7, 170064) And then I got Charlie's 1 letter.
('68', 90, 4, 8, 170099) He has given a vivid description of the state of your health.
('68', 90, 4, 9, 170161) I can imagine from it what agony you have been passing through and with what courage you are enduring all the suffering.
('68', 90, 4, 10, 170282) You have endured so much mental suffering that in comparison with it this physical suffering should be nothing.
('68', 90, 4, 11, 170394) I hope to see in you increasing awareness of God even asyour suffering increases.
('68', 90, 4, 12, 170476) I feel easy in mind because of the knowledge that Hilda is with you.
('68', 90, 4, 13, 170545) Please ask her to write to me sometimes.
('68', 90, 4, 14, 170586) Charlie tells me in this letter that you often wish you were at Panchgani.
('68', 90, 4, 15, 170661) I have indeed often wished that you were in India.
('68', 90, 4, 16, 170712) If you were here today and in good health, I could have got so much work out of you in connection with village industries.
('68', 90, 4, 17, 170835) But God's will be done.
('68', 90, 4, 18, 170859) Now please get all right soon.

('68', 91, 15, 23, 172483) I had the one written prior to your reaching Boston but none since then which is extremely surprising.
('68', 91, 15, 24, 172586) I could not reach you at the ports of call but I am now trying to write almost every week but your letters have stopped coming.
('68', 91, 15, 25, 172714) Every week I look forward to a letter from you and am invariably disappointed.
('68', 91, 15, 26, 172793) I feel that you have written but they are still in transit from New York.

('68', 92, 4, 7, 173399) 110. ON ITS LAST LEGS
('68', 92, 5, 8, 173421) Some critics have not hesitated to observe that it was preposterous for me to claim, in answer to Dr. Ambedkar's threat to accept some other faith rather than die a Hindu, that untouchability was on its last legs in spite of Kavitha.
('68', 92, 5, 9, 173655) Indeed, Kavitha itself supports my claim.
('68', 92, 5, 10, 173697) Kavitha had gone on ever since its birth living peacefully till an our zealous worker, not knowing his own limitations, had put up Kavitha Harijans to dare to send their children to the local school, though he knew that there was opposition from some Kavitha savarnas.
('68', 92, 5, 11, 173966) He had hoped, as had happened elsewhere, that Harijans had successfully asserted their right to send their children to public schools.
('68', 92, 5, 12, 174101) But Kavitha savarnas showed that they had not recognized the time spirit.
('68', 92, 5, 13, 174175) Only a few years ago the Kavitha incident would have attracted no notice.
('68', 92, 5, 14, 174249) There were very few reformers then.
('68', 92, 5, 15, 174285) The few were to be found mostly in towns and cities.
('68', 92, 5, 16, 174338) Now, thank God, their number is increasing and presently every village will have its quota.
('68', 92, 5, 17, 174430) But a few years ago Harijans could not be induced to resist untouchability on any account whatsoever.
('68', 92, 5, 18, 174532) It was part of their faith as it was of savarnas' faith.
('68', 92, 5, 19, 174589) These columns contain sufficient evidence of the weekly progress made by the campaign against untouchability.
('68', 92, 5, 20, 174699) Phenomenal though the progress has been, Kavitha and the like show that it has not yet affected the majority of savarnas in many places.
('68', 92, 5, 21, 174836) The fact is a warning to the reformers and the Harijans that much has yet to be done before the hard hearts of savarnas are melted.
('68', 92, 5, 22, 174968) Let it be further observed that it was savarna reformers who advertised the Kavitha tragedy and gave it an all India importance.
('68', 92, 5, 23, 175097) It has agitated savarna conscience more than it has angered the
('68', 93, 0, 1, 175161) 94 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('68', 93, 1, 2, 175202) Harijans.
('68', 93, 1, 3, 175212) I have to note with shame and sorrow that even Kavitha Harijans no longer want to agitate for their rights.
('68', 93, 1, 4, 175320) They have meekly submitted to the savarna impudence.
('68', 93, 1, 5, 175373) In spite of all the help offered to them, they would not leave Kavitha.
('68', 93, 1, 6, 175445) It is easy enough for the few that are there to earn their bread by honourable toil elsewhere.
('68', 93, 1, 7, 175540) The attempt of the reformers to induce them to leave Kavitha under their protection has failed.
('68', 93, 1, 8, 175636) Even if change of faith, not on account of its inherent inadequacy but because of the unreasoning prejudice of many of its followers, were justified, in the present instance it can but defeat the cause intended to be served.
('68', 93, 1, 9, 175861) Secession of stalwarts like Dr. Ambedkar can but weaken the defences of Harijans.
('68', 93, 1, 10, 175943) We know, as a matter of fact, that non Hindu Harijans, no matter how eminent they may be, are not able to help Hindu Harijans.
('68', 93, 1, 11, 176070) Indeed, they are a class apart still in their adopted faiths.
('68', 93, 1, 12, 176132) Such is the hold untouchability of the Indian type has on the people in India.
('68', 93, 1, 13, 176211) Let not Dr. Ambedkar's just wrath deject the reformer, let it spur him to greater effort.
('68', 93, 1, 14, 176301) For whilst it is true that the number of workers against untouchability has greatly increased, there can be no doubt that the number is yet too small to overtake the prejudice of ages.
('68', 93, 1, 15, 176486) Nevertheless [with] a movement which has attained the proportions that the anti untouchability campaign has attained and in which the slightest untoward incident can attract world wide attention, [untouchability] cannot but be on its last legs.
('68', 93, 1, 16, 176731) Humanity will not suffer it any longer.

('68', 93, 4, 19, 176809) Some of the readers of Harijan may recall the periodical publications of khadi bulletins givng all kinds of useful information to khadi workers.
('68', 93, 4, 20, 176954) It was part of the pioneer work done by the late Maganlal Gandhi who built up the science of khadi.
('68', 93, 4, 21, 177054) Shri T. Sreenivas of Secunderabad sends me a copy of one of these bulletins called Dev Cotton published in 1923. It is almost prophetic or rather shows how attempts were being made even in the early stages of the movement to work out a scheme or self sufficing khadi.
('68', 93, 4, 22, 177322) Now that it is to have the

('68', 94, 1, 2, 177394) first place in the activities of the A.I.S.A. the reader will appreciate the reproduction of the bulletin 1:

('68', 94, 3, 4, 177523) 112. NEW KHADI SCHEME
('68', 94, 4, 5, 177545) The resolution 2 adopted by the A.I.S.A. regarding spinners' wages and khadi policy generally deserves the careful study of every khadi worker.
('68', 94, 4, 6, 177689) It can produce great changes, if the new policy is properly worked.
('68', 94, 4, 7, 177757) In order to work it properly, all the instructions issued from time to time from the Centre should be meticulously carried out.
('68', 94, 4, 8, 177885) Self sufficing khadi has to receive the first place in all khadi organizations.
('68', 94, 4, 9, 177965) In a way, self sufficing khadi and production for sale will go together.
('68', 94, 4, 10, 178038) Production for sale will be a by product of self sufficing khadi, and the latter will ensure the success of the former.
('68', 94, 4, 11, 178158) As the condition of production is that the workers must be khadi clad, they will have to make or take khadi for themselves.
('68', 94, 4, 12, 178282) This they can easily do out of the (for them) very big rise in their wages which they will be receiving without having expected or demanded it.
('68', 94, 4, 13, 178426) But receipt of wages will depend upon the surplus production which to be of use must command a ready sale.
('68', 94, 4, 14, 178533) Thus self sufficing methods will be easy where there are producing centres.
('68', 94, 4, 15, 178609) For the spinners and other artisans will be more open to conviction than the others with whom workers have never come in touch.
('68', 94, 4, 16, 178737) But some ask, who will buy khadi at higher prices?
('68', 94, 4, 17, 178788) In my opinion this betrays ignorance and want of faith and resourcefulness.
('68', 94, 4, 18, 178864) Hitherto we have confined our attention to stimulating demand in the cities: we have been urban minded.
('68', 94, 4, 19, 178968) We have never cared to study the localities immediately surrounding centres of production, we have neglected the very producers themselves.
('68', 94, 4, 20, 179108) Now, before we even tested the latter, we seem to have confidence that they will respond.
('68', 94, 4, 21, 179198) Why should we not have the same confidence about the people in the surrounding localities?
('68', 94, 4, 22, 179289) Surely they need cloth for their daily use.
('68', 94, 4, 23, 179333) Is it too much to expect them to take in some khadi manufactured by their next door neighbours?
('68', 94, 4, 24, 179429) I know that those who have made an earnest effort in that direction have never failed.
('68', 94, 4, 25, 179516) Failure has been with us, not

('68', 95, 1, 2, 179649) with the prospective buyers.
('68', 95, 1, 3, 179678) They are always with us, it does not matter what they buy and use today.
('68', 95, 1, 4, 179751) If we 1 would study the wants of the surrounding localities, we would produce khadi that would suit their taste and arrest their attention.
('68', 95, 1, 5, 179891) Khadi workers have done that before now with success for the sake of the city dwellers.
('68', 95, 1, 6, 179979) Will they now turn their attention towards rural areas?
('68', 95, 1, 7, 180035) It is not so much the dearness of khadi that turns people away from it.
('68', 95, 1, 8, 180107) It is our want of faith and resourcefulness.
('68', 95, 1, 9, 180152) If we have faith, we shall find that the same millions are open to us as they are to the vendors of fents that come to us from the Far East.
('68', 95, 1, 10, 180293) They rely upon the cheapness of their pieces to produce a demand for their wares.
('68', 95, 1, 11, 180375) We may rely upon local patriotism and the tastefulness of our wares to tempt the would be buyers of cloth.
('68', 95, 1, 12, 180482) It is not without full justification that the Council of the A.I.S.A. has insisted upon every khadi organization being self supporting and hence autonomous.

('68', 97, 1, 4, 182355) Mathew has arrived here.
('68', 97, 1, 5, 182380) I have made everything plain to him.
('68', 97, 1, 6, 182417) I have fixed the whole day's programme of work for him.
('68', 97, 1, 7, 182473) It consists entirely of physical labour.
('68', 97, 1, 8, 182514) I have told him that if he learns sufficient Hindi to satisfy me and takes whole hearted interest in physical labour, I am ready to provide for the maintenance of his parents.

('68', 97, 4, 19, 183097) 117. PROBLEMS CONFRONTING A SANITARY WORKER
('68', 97, 5, 20, 183141) A volunteer who has taken up the task of sanitation in villages has written a long letter from which I give the following extract 2. This letter may be divided into two partsone relating to the incopetence of the ordinary worker and the other about the difficulties involved in the work of sanitation.
('68', 97, 5, 21, 183443) It can certainly be said that very little progress, if at all, can be made in a task which is not done in an enlightened manner.
('68', 97, 5, 22, 183572) A volunteer who does his work with sincerity will indeed come at last to do it intelligently.
('68', 97, 5, 23, 183666) It may so happen that a person may do the work entrusted to him through a sense of loyalty to his superior but there may be an absence both of sincerity and knowledge.
('68', 97, 5, 24, 183834) Such volunteers continue to give the expected results and we can hardly hope for any enlightenment or of any new discoveries resulting from their work.
('68', 97, 5, 25, 183986) Every volunteer should become engrossed in the work entrusted to him and keep doing research in it.
('68', 97, 5, 26, 184086) From experiences published in Harijan we find that this has happened in certain places.
('68', 97, 5, 27, 184174) Some are seeking ways and means to do away with the indifference of the people, while others are trying to find out how night soil can be

('68', 98, 0, 1, 184368) VOL. 68 : 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 99
('68', 98, 1, 2, 184413) disposed of with the least expenditure and in the simplest manner.
('68', 98, 1, 3, 184480) This is happening in relation to Sindi.
('68', 98, 1, 4, 184520) The people's indifference persists.
('68', 98, 1, 5, 184556) There is no response from them.
('68', 98, 1, 6, 184588) Hence, Mirabehn has as a last resort gone to live there.
('68', 98, 1, 7, 184645) Underlying this is the conviction that the people's indifference cannot be done away with so long as we do not find out someone to live amongst the people of every village.
('68', 98, 1, 8, 184818) Methods are being evolved also for the rapid disposal of night soil.
('68', 98, 1, 9, 184887) There is no end to the difficulties of volunteers; the work of sanitation is more difficult than all other forms of service, as it is regarded as the meanest of tasks.
('68', 98, 1, 10, 185055) There is a feeling of great disgust attached to it.
('68', 98, 1, 11, 185107) Very few persons are prepared to do this work.
('68', 98, 1, 12, 185154) I am of the opinion that there should be only one volunteer for every village.
('68', 98, 1, 13, 185233) It is possible that this will yield result most quickly.
('68', 98, 1, 14, 185290) He will realize that he alone is responsible for the sanitation of the entire village.
('68', 98, 1, 15, 185377) By himself, he will never be able to cope with the entire work of sanitation if people from the village itself do not come forward to help him.
('68', 98, 1, 16, 185521) When faced with problems, human beings find out new ways; hence the English saying: necessity is the mother of invention.
('68', 98, 1, 17, 185643) As in the work of sanitation so too in the task of disposal of night soil it is difficult to find assistance from the villagers.
('68', 98, 1, 18, 185772) Let us take the example of Sindi again.
('68', 98, 1, 19, 185812) People there defecate publicly in their own courtyards.
('68', 98, 1, 20, 185868) The neighbouring fields are surrounded by fences, so these cannot be used.
('68', 98, 1, 21, 185943) No one would be prepared to go very far.
('68', 98, 1, 22, 185984) The village popu lation consists of labourers.
('68', 98, 1, 23, 186031) How can the latter find the time to go to a distance?
('68', 98, 1, 24, 186085) How far can the womenfolk go?
('68', 98, 1, 25, 186115) If so, nothing need be said of children.
('68', 98, 1, 26, 186156) Hence, as a last resort, nothing but courtyards remain for the people to make use of.
('68', 98, 1, 27, 186242) Villagers are not accustomed to have a latrine in evey household.
('68', 98, 1, 28, 186308) Hence so long as there are no public latrines in fair numbers or people are not prepared to make their own, public roads will continue to be used as latrines.
('68', 98, 1, 29, 186467) In fact, so long as every individual does not acquire a knowledge of sanitation and he does not put it into practice, the practice of using roads as latrines, despite its being unseemly, is perhaps the least harmful from the hygienic point of view and may be tolerated.
('68', 98, 1, 30, 186737) How can a single volunteer living in a village facing such a situation carry out the work of sanitation?
('68', 98, 1, 31, 186842) He should set aside a certain time each day for this task.
('68', 98, 1, 32, 186901) So long as he is staying there, he should spend that time in educating the people and keeping the place clean to the extent that it is possible to do it singlehanded.
('68', 98, 1, 33, 187068) As soon as someone is ready to take up the work of sanitation in the locality, he
('68', 99, 0, 1, 187150) 100 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('68', 99, 1, 2, 187192) himself should seek out yet another locality in the same village.
('68', 99, 1, 3, 187258) If he is capable enough he should seek the assistance of the district board and such other authorities for sanitary work.
('68', 99, 1, 4, 187380) He should find out the best possible use for the night soil which accumulates every day.
('68', 99, 1, 5, 187469) He may either sell it to the owners of the fields nearby and use whatever he so earns for further sanitation work in that very area, or, if no one is prepared to purchase it, he should give it away to any farmer who is prepared to use the manure made out of it in his field and demonstrate how useful it is.
('68', 99, 1, 6, 187777) This is but a trend of thought presented to the reader.
('68', 99, 1, 7, 187833) I have not been able to put this idea totally into practice myself, nor to make others do so.
('68', 99, 1, 8, 187927) After all this field of work is but new.
('68', 99, 1, 9, 187968) Hence, for the present, there can only be an exchange of ideas.
('68', 99, 1, 10, 188032) Volunteers who are doing this work will adopt from this whatever is worth adopting.
('68', 99, 1, 11, 188116) They will inform me of any drawback in these ideas, and report to me the experience which they have gained wherever these have been put into practice.

('68', 102, 6, 19, 192534) When you feel tired, you may wind up your work there.
('68', 102, 6, 20, 192588) Do not wait till you are besieged on all sides.
('68', 102, 6, 21, 192636) One must understand one's limitations.
('68', 102, 6, 22, 192675) If the quarrels go on increasing and you feel helpless against them, you should frankly admit defeat and wind up the whole thing.
('68', 102, 6, 23, 192805) Rent out the orchard to somebody.
('68', 102, 6, 24, 192839) If you get a buyer, sell it off.
('68', 102, 6, 25, 192872) If the public want the journal 2, they should meet the expenditure.
('68', 102, 6, 26, 192940) If they do not want it, it is against our principle to force it on them.
('68', 102, 6, 27, 193013) About the Trust, I shall think and let you know.
('68', 102, 6, 28, 193062) I tried hard to persuade Ramdas to accompany Pragji, but he did not yield.
('68', 102, 6, 29, 193137) Manu has been betrothed to Surendra, which means one more tie with the Mashruwala family.
('68', 102, 6, 30, 193227) May the new year see you prosper.

('68', 103, 4, 7, 193794) Even in your short letter you have committed quite a number of spelling mistakes.
('68', 103, 4, 8, 193876) Will you be able to take it well when Manu points out your mistakes?

('68', 103, 9, 15, 194209) CHHAGANLAL,
('68', 103, 10, 16, 194221) If the women spinners there refuse to accept khadi or they keep back a part of their yarn for their own clothing before giving it for weaving, you should give them no spinning work.
('68', 103, 10, 17, 194403) Do not mind if as a result no spinner is left in Vijapur.
('68', 103, 10, 18, 194461) If middleclass people wish to spin for their own requirements, you may give them the necessary facilities.
('68', 103, 10, 19, 194568) If nobody listens to your appeal to wear khadi or to spin for his or her own clothing or by way of service, you may leave off khadi work.
('68', 103, 10, 20, 194706) If the people agree to learn some other village or home industry, you may create the necessary facilities to enable them to do so, but see that we do not have to bear the expense for that.
('68', 103, 10, 21, 194895) It should be possible to meet it from the sale proceeds of the articles produced.
('68', 103, 10, 22, 194977) And see that the industries which you select are also such that their products have a ready market; for instance, ghee, oil, jaggery, paper and some medicinal foods.
('68', 103, 10, 23, 195143) This is only an illustrative list.

('68', 104, 1, 4, 195438) I note that Gangabehn 1 refuses to sign for registration a document transferring the land and the building to the names of the trustees of the Ashram.
('68', 104, 1, 5, 195589) But in spite of her refusal to sign there is no risk to the land.
('68', 104, 1, 6, 195655) We have with us a document signed by her and, therefore, she can create no difficulty.
('68', 104, 1, 7, 195742) And no third party can do so either.
('68', 104, 1, 8, 195779) Am I right?
('68', 104, 1, 9, 195791) If, however, there is any risk even in this, discuss the matter with Mavalankar 2. Manu was betrothed the day before yesterday to Surendra Mashruwala.
('68', 104, 1, 10, 195942) She is here for the present.

('68', 104, 7, 18, 196206) But when many undeserving people escape from me, what is surprising about your escaping?
('68', 104, 7, 19, 196295) Do come over.
('68', 104, 7, 20, 196309) Why should Gautam 1 and Vikram also not spend a day here?
('68', 104, 7, 21, 196367) Tempt them to come if you can give the place a good certificate after your visit.
('68', 104, 7, 22, 196449) You can have the reply to the second part of your letter after coming here.

('68', 105, 6, 8, 197189) MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL, I have your letter.
('68', 105, 6, 9, 197229) We have to be prepared for ups and downs in Kamala's health.
('68', 105, 6, 10, 197290) I marvel at the resisting power Kamala is showing and so long as she has got this tremendous reserve of strength and will, we can hope for the best; at least I do.
('68', 105, 6, 11, 197454) When I said good bye to her in Bombay, I did not feel that we were parting for all time, and I naturally said: We are going to meet again in a year's time, if I am out till then. I claim to have that hope still and I interpret your reports in that light.
('68', 105, 6, 12, 197709) I understand the depth of feeling behind your intense disinclination to see the big folk, 1 but I know that in spite of your disinclination, if there is a real approach to you, you are not going to be unapproachable.
('68', 105, 6, 13, 197926) I know that at a given moment your decisions are always correct.
('68', 105, 6, 14, 197991) Your firm decision, therefore, does not frighten me.
('68', 105, 6, 15, 198044) I share your view, however, that during the election fever nobody would want to see you, nobody would be in the mood to discuss things that are irrelevant to their electioneering campaign, and India has ever been irrelevant on such occasions.
('68', 105, 6, 16, 198287) From your standpoint you will be going to England at a safe time.
('68', 105, 6, 17, 198353) Khurshedbehn will be most probably leaving for Bombay on Wednesday.
('68', 105, 6, 18, 198421) She has a bit of a literary programme before her which should keep her busy for some months.
('68', 105, 6, 19, 198514) I wonder if you have ever time to look into Harijan, which is sent to you regularly?

('68', 106, 3, 4, 198858) DEAR FRIEND,
('68', 106, 4, 5, 198871) I have your very interesting letter.
('68', 106, 4, 6, 198908) I simply cannot tax my mind about offices.
('68', 106, 4, 7, 198951) I do not even know that the Constitution is coming.
('68', 106, 4, 8, 199003) That it has received the Kings assent is not of much consequence.
('68', 106, 4, 9, 199069) Theres many a slip between the cup and the lip.
('68', 106, 4, 10, 199117) The inauguration is still far off.
('68', 106, 4, 11, 199152) Many events may happen to upset the apple cart, and way should I worry over a thing which is highly problematical?
('68', 106, 4, 12, 199267) But I can say this, that if the Constitution does actually begin to work and if I find that there is no escape from taking office, that is, if the Congress is represented in the Legislatures, I would not hesitate to say so.
('68', 106, 4, 13, 199491) Just at present, I can see many an escape from the predicament.
('68', 106, 4, 14, 199555) I do not think we need speculate about the Congress President because Jawaharlal Nehru has definitely written, saying that if the responsibility is entrusted to him, he will shoulder the burden.
('68', 106, 4, 15, 199750) There should be no difficulty about his return in March.
('68', 106, 4, 16, 199807) You will be welcome whenever you come.
('68', 106, 4, 17, 199846) From January my movements become uncertain.

('68', 107, 7, 14, 201075) You are a man of faith.

('68', 107, 11, 21, 201323) BHAI VALLABHBHAI, Enclosed is a letter from Parikshitlal.
('68', 107, 11, 22, 201381) You seem to have read it.
('68', 107, 11, 23, 201407) I think I was wrong in giving my consent.
('68', 107, 11, 24, 201449) Before I correct myself, however, I must have a clear idea of the situation 2. I think that, if Harijans are physically ill treated in a place and if they cannot get redress in any other way, they should leave that village and we should encourage them to do so.
('68', 107, 11, 25, 201711) I have accepted and followed this policy for many years, both for individuals and groups.
('68', 107, 11, 26, 201801) I started advocating it in 1906 and gave expression to my views in writing in 1908, and since then I have given the same advice on all occasions.

('68', 108, 1, 3, 202313) In Talaja, Pattanisaheb 1 intervened on behalf of the Harijans.
('68', 108, 1, 4, 202377) In the village near Meerut, there was a court case which dragged on for a long time and the Harijans lost it.
('68', 108, 1, 5, 202487) The lawyers and other advisers were lukewarm and the matter was not pursued.
('68', 108, 1, 6, 202564) Possibly there are special reasons in the case of Kavitha which make mass migration inadvisable.
('68', 108, 1, 7, 202661) But what is the harm if the Harijans, all or some of them, leave the place after serving notice on the caste Hindus?
('68', 108, 1, 8, 202778) If you differ with me about this, please explain your point of view to me.
('68', 108, 1, 9, 202853) I don't know if there are any special circumstances in Kavitha.
('68', 108, 1, 10, 202917) You have been there and so will be able to throw plenty of light on the situation.
('68', 108, 1, 11, 203000) We should not treat the Kavitha chapter as closed.
('68', 108, 1, 12, 203051) We do not hear that the kind of things which happen in Gujarat ever happen in the other provinces.
('68', 108, 1, 13, 203150) In Tamil Nad the relations between Nairs [sic] and Harijans are equally bad, but I have not heard of such things happening anywhere else.
('68', 108, 1, 14, 203288) We must find some remedy.
('68', 108, 1, 15, 203314) Valchand 2 is thinking of coming here and bringing Ambedkar with him.
('68', 108, 1, 16, 203384) They have asked me about the programme to be drawn up during my visit there.
('68', 108, 1, 17, 203461) It should include a tour of the Bhil areas and a tour for public collections for the Harijan Fund.
('68', 108, 1, 18, 203560) If the operations are necessary, you should get them done as soon as possible,unless of course the doctors think otherwise.

('68', 109, 8, 21, 205257) If anybody from among the Harijans in Kavitha still wishes to leave the place, he can do so.
('68', 109, 8, 22, 205350) Parikshitlal is keeping a watch on the situation.
('68', 109, 8, 23, 205400) What you say may be practicable where one latrine is used by one person.
('68', 109, 8, 24, 205473) But in a place like Santa Cruz, as many as 25 people may be living in one bungalow.
('68', 109, 8, 25, 205557) The latrine is at a height of 25 to 30 feet so that the stools fall to the ground from that height.
('68', 109, 8, 26, 205657) Again, this can

('68', 110, 1, 3, 205797) Now if there are no Bhangis in such a place, how and by whom would the latrine be cleaned?
('68', 110, 1, 4, 205888) And such cleanliness maintained as you describe?
('68', 110, 1, 5, 205937) What you say about food and drink is correct.
('68', 110, 1, 6, 205983) But since I myself have not been able to reach such an ideal state despite my strenuous efforts, what light can I throw on the subject?
('68', 110, 1, 7, 206119) May be, in order to reach it many other things are necessary besides right food.
('68', 110, 1, 8, 206200) Let all of us strive our best to reach it.

('68', 110, 7, 14, 206443) Why do you fall ill so often?
('68', 110, 7, 15, 206473) I hope you don't think that devotion to one's father means that whenever the latter is ill one should fall ill, too?
('68', 110, 7, 16, 206590) Shravana's parents were infirm, but he made his body as strong as steel and took them round on a pilgrimage, carrying them in a kavad carried across his shoulders.
('68', 110, 7, 17, 206754) King Lear's daughter maintained good health while serving her father.
('68', 110, 7, 18, 206824) Why have you, then, become prematurely old?
('68', 110, 7, 19, 206868) If not indigestion, you have fever, and if not that you have cold, but you are always suffering from one thing or another.

('68', 111, 2, 3, 207247) October 1935
('68', 111, 3, 4, 207260) NARANDAS,
('68', 111, 4, 5, 207270) I got your letter.
('68', 111, 4, 6, 207289) How could you trust Harilal?
('68', 111, 4, 7, 207318) How can we believe in anything he says when drunk?
('68', 111, 4, 8, 207369) But I am quite guarded.
('68', 111, 4, 9, 207393) I am not going to spend a single pie out of public funds for his coming here or for keeping him here.
('68', 111, 4, 10, 207495) I hope you also have not promised to pay him the [railway] fare from such funds.
('68', 111, 4, 11, 207576) You know that formerly he had asked me for the fare and I had plainly refused.
('68', 111, 4, 12, 207655) Why do you insist on calling away Kanu against his will?
('68', 111, 4, 13, 207712) He has settled down here now, his studies are progressing and his health also is improving.
('68', 111, 4, 14, 207804) He does not at all feel happy in Rajkot.
('68', 111, 4, 15, 207845) What is then the point in sending for him?
('68', 111, 4, 16, 207888) He has been here only for fourteen months.
('68', 111, 4, 17, 207931) He has been entrusted with responsible work.
('68', 111, 4, 18, 207976) For that reason, too, it will be difficult for him to leave.
('68', 111, 4, 19, 208037) If he is to accompany me on my tour, he wouldn't like to miss even one day from it.
('68', 111, 4, 20, 208121) Such absence would stand in the way of his acquiring practical experience, and perhaps I may not be in a position to spare him at that time.
('68', 111, 4, 21, 208262) When he is needed here, I am sure you will not call him away.
('68', 111, 4, 22, 208324) Hence, the most convenient and the best time for him to go there would be when I am here.
('68', 111, 4, 23, 208414) Let Santok 1, therefore, come [here] any day between now and December 31 or she may do so after I return and get settled here, that is, at the earliest after the end of March.
('68', 111, 4, 24, 208590) If you take into account Kanu's inclination and my convenience, he should be called away only after March, or for a few days just now.
('68', 111, 4, 25, 208725) Personally he does not wish to leave this place for the present.
('68', 111, 4, 26, 208790) That also should be borne in mind.
('68', 111, 4, 27, 208825) But finally your wish is to prevail.
('68', 111, 4, 28, 208862) I have simply given you the facts which I know, to enable you to come to a decision.
('68', 111, 4, 29, 208947) You will know from his letter what activities he is engaged in here.
('68', 111, 4, 30, 209016) Do let me know your final decision.
('68', 111, 4, 31, 209052) I will carry it out.
('68', 111, 4, 32, 209073) If Jamnadas remains so ill, how will he be able to take up responsible tasks in his present condition?
('68', 111, 4, 33, 209176) What arrangement has been made for his expenses?
('68', 111, 4, 34, 209225) What is the expenditure on account of Chimanlal?

('68', 112, 1, 3, 209415) Send me the figure of the expenditure incurred every month from the Ashram reserves.
('68', 112, 1, 4, 209500) The reasoning behind three yards and two yards of khadi is this: Satis Babu and Jethalal think that any spinner who wishes to consume three yards of khadi for personal use will, if he produces two yards of khadi for sale, realize the cost of the three yards.
('68', 112, 1, 5, 209759) These figures have no importance.
('68', 112, 1, 6, 209793) We have made the calculations here on a different basis.
('68', 112, 1, 7, 209850) I have not gone through them.

('68', 112, 6, 14, 210091) Your meal is very meagre, it is starvation diet.
('68', 112, 6, 15, 210140) In my opinion, you are not making full use of the instrument that God has put at your disposal.
('68', 112, 6, 16, 210236) You know the story of the talents 2 that were taken away from him who did not know how to use them, or having known would not use them?
('68', 112, 6, 17, 210372) Mortification of the flesh is a necessity when the flesh rebels against one; it is a sin when the flesh has come under subjection and can be used as an instrument of service.
('68', 112, 6, 18, 210547) In other words, there is no inherent merit in mortification of the flesh.

('68', 113, 4, 7, 211130) The scheme is being slowly inaugurated.

('68', 113, 5, 10, 211282) I would like you, therefore, as you travel, to sow the seed and create a demand for khadi in the immediate neighbourhood of production centres.
('68', 113, 5, 11, 211426) Once this is done, khadi will occupy its natural and deserved place.
('68', 113, 5, 12, 211495) If it is not an undue strain upon you I would suggest your reading all that is being written in the Harijan about the scheme.

('68', 113, 10, 18, 211746) A visitor asked Gandhiji if he was not putting too much emphasis on the gospel of work, if not making a kind of fetish of work.
('68', 113, 10, 19, 211874) Gandhiji replied: Not at all.
('68', 113, 10, 20, 211904) I have always meant what I said.
('68', 113, 10, 21, 211937) There can never be too much emphasis placed on work.
('68', 113, 10, 22, 211990) I am simply repeating the gospel taught by the Gita where the Lord says: If I did not remain ever at work sleeplessly, I should set a wrong example to mankind. 5 Did I not appeal to the professional men to turn the wheel to set an example to the rest of our countrymen?

('68', 114, 2, 5, 212878) Who am I to judge them?
('68', 114, 3, 6, 212902) But you would judge Buddha?
('68', 114, 3, 7, 212930) I never said so.
('68', 114, 3, 8, 212947) I simply said, if I had the good fortune to be face to face with one like him, I should not hesitate to ask him why he did not teach the gospel of work, in preference to one of contemplation.

('68', 114, 5, 11, 213217) 140. NEED FOR HUMANE CUSTOM
('68', 114, 6, 12, 213245) Dr. P.C. Ray, who at his ripe age of 75 is exhibiting in the interest of suffering humanity the energy of youth, writes: 1
('68', 114, 7, 13, 213368) The custom for fine khadi has fallen off even before the expected or rather threatened rise in prices.
('68', 114, 7, 14, 213471) When it falls further, if it does, it will do so not because of the rise in prices but undoubtedly because of want of love or humanity in the buyer.
('68', 114, 7, 15, 213620) Humanity does not search for low prices in a spirit of bargain.
('68', 114, 7, 16, 213684) The humane in man, even in his purchases, seeks opportunities of service, and therefore wants to know first not the price of the article of purchase but the condition of its producers, and makes purchases in a manner that serves most the most needy and deserving.
('68', 114, 7, 17, 213948) If a sufficiently large number of men and women were actuated by this spirit of love of fellow beings, there would be an ever increasing demand for khadi, and now more than ever, because of the knowledge that extraordinary care is being taken to assure to the humblest spinner at least a subsistence wagea wage which would enable her not merely to eke out a living somehow but which would enable her to get sustaining food.
('68', 114, 7, 18, 214372) Side by side with the attempt to give khadi artisans a subsistence wage there must be an attempt to find a better, i.e., more natural market for khadi.
('68', 114, 7, 19, 214524) We have hitherto been satisfied with the easy way of obtaining custom only in the big citiessuch as Bombay, Calcutta, Madras, etc.
('68', 114, 7, 20, 214655) This was surely wrong.
('68', 114, 7, 21, 214678) I have suggested to Dr. Ray that
('68', 114, 8, 22, 214711) 1 The letter is not reproduced here.
('68', 114, 8, 23, 214748) P. C. Ray had written that they in Bengal had to seek the Bombay market as there was very little sale of fine khadi in Bengal.
('68', 115, 0, 1, 214875) 116 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('68', 115, 1, 2, 214917) he should, if his health permits, deliver his message of love to the places surrounding the producing centres.
('68', 115, 1, 3, 215028) The whole of Bengal wears fine cloth.
('68', 115, 1, 4, 215066) Why should it not wear fine khadi?
('68', 115, 1, 5, 215101) Under the new scheme it is possible to cheapen khadi if Bengal will produce cotton not for speculation but strictly for home use.
('68', 115, 1, 6, 215231) But that day may be far off.
('68', 115, 1, 7, 215260) For the time being Bengal as the rest of India should buy khadi for humanity's sake, not in a commercial spirit, counting the cost.
('68', 115, 1, 8, 215392) We do not count the cost and find out what our children or our aged parents cost us.
('68', 115, 1, 9, 215477) We support them at any cost.
('68', 115, 1, 10, 215506) Should we do less for our millions of brothers and sisters who are starving by reason of our criminal neglect of them for centuries?
('68', 115, 1, 11, 215639) We may leave no part of India neglected.
('68', 115, 1, 12, 215680) The science of khadi requires decentralization of pro duction and consumption.
('68', 115, 1, 13, 215759) Consumption should take place as nearly as possible where khadi is produced.
('68', 115, 1, 14, 215836) All effort should be directed towards that end.
('68', 115, 1, 15, 215884) We may produce for the demands of the cities, but should never depend upon them as we would on the local market.
('68', 115, 1, 16, 215997) We must first study the local market and supply its wants.
('68', 115, 1, 17, 216056) And since all khadi artisans and wherever possible all artisans working under the aegis of the A.I.S.A. or A. I. V. I. A. will be expected to use khadi, a minimum demand will thus always be assured.
('68', 115, 1, 18, 216255) Satis Babu and Shri Jethalal of Anantpur have made independent calculations and have concluded that self sufficing khadi will mean two yards of sale outside against three yards of wear by the artisans.
('68', 115, 1, 19, 216457) If the calculation is correct, self sufficing khadi to be popular will need considerable support from local markets.
('68', 115, 1, 20, 216574) Since other industries will go hand in hand with khadi, it may be that self sufficing khadi will receive help through village industries other than khadi.
('68', 115, 1, 21, 216729) The test of self sufficing khadi lies in the fact that it will cost the wearer practically nothing but his labour.
('68', 115, 1, 22, 216844) Self sufficing khadi will never spread unless local markets are created all over the country and demand stabilized.
('68', 115, 1, 23, 216960) In order to ensure stabilization it is necessary to define areas for every producing centre so as to avoid overlapping and unhealthy competition among workers attached to the same organization.

('68', 115, 4, 26, 217183) Those who can afford it are fond of eating ghee.
('68', 115, 4, 27, 217232) It enters into the preparation of almost all the sweetmeats.
('68', 115, 4, 28, 217293) And yet, or perhaps by reason of it, it is one of the most adulterated articles of food The vast
('68', 116, 0, 1, 217390) VOL. 68 : 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 117
('68', 116, 1, 2, 217436) bulk of it that one gets in the bazar is undoubtedly adulterated.
('68', 116, 1, 3, 217502) Some, if not most, of it is mixed with injurious fats which non meat eaters must not eat.
('68', 116, 1, 4, 217592) Vegetable oils are often mixed with ghee.
('68', 116, 1, 5, 217634) This mixture diminishes the vitamin value of ghee when it does not contain rancid oils.When the oils mixed are rancid, the ghee is unfit for consumption.
('68', 116, 1, 6, 217788) At Maganwadi we have been insisting on procuring cow's ghee.
('68', 116, 1, 7, 217849) It has meant much difficulty and great expense.
('68', 116, 1, 8, 217897) We have paid as much as Rs. 29 per 40 lb.
('68', 116, 1, 9, 217939) plus railage.
('68', 116, 1, 10, 217953) This can only be for a rich man's pockets.
('68', 116, 1, 11, 217996) We are trying as much as we can to approximate the poor man's standard consistent with balanced diet scale.
('68', 116, 1, 12, 218104) I observed that Dr. Aykroyd had omitted ghee from his balanced diet scale.
('68', 116, 1, 13, 218179) 1 Medical testimony, while it insists on milk or buttermilk, does not insist on butter or ghee as an indispensable part of the daily menu.
('68', 116, 1, 14, 218318) We have tentatively dropped ghee from our menu, except for those who consider it to be necessary for their health.
('68', 116, 1, 15, 218433) We are issuing an equivalent in weight of pure fresh vegetable oils.
('68', 116, 1, 16, 218502) Millions in India never know the taste of ghee.
('68', 116, 1, 17, 218550) After all it should be borne in mind that those who take milk get some ghee in the purest and most assimilable form.
('68', 116, 1, 18, 218667) Apart from the question of relish it may safely be said that village workers can with impunity omit ghee from their diet so long as they can procure some milk or curds or buttermilk.
('68', 116, 1, 19, 218850) At the same time it is the duty of wealthy people and public bodies like municipalities to place at the disposal of the poor people cheap wholesome unadulterated milk and its products.
('68', 116, 1, 20, 219035) Adulteration of milk or other foods should be as difficult as counterfeit coin or note or postage stamp, and their value should be standardized as is that of postage stamps.
('68', 116, 1, 21, 219209) If half the skill that is today devoted to the management of commercial concerns meant for private gain were devoted to the conduct of dairies for the public benefit and shops for food stuffs, they could be run as self supporting institutions.
('68', 116, 1, 22, 219453) There is nothing to prevent them from becoming so, except the public disinclination to give the requisite skill and capital to such philanthropic concerns.
('68', 116, 1, 23, 219609) The benevolence of the wealthy is exhausted in the effort to run sadavrats 2, to misfeed the ever increasing army of beggars who are a burden on society.
('68', 116, 1, 24, 219763) For they eat without labouring.
('68', 116, 1, 25, 219795) It is benevolence misplaced, if it may not be described as mischievous.
('68', 116, 1, 26, 219867) The difficulty

('68', 117, 1, 2, 220010) amounting to impossibility of getting wholesome articles of diet at reasonable rates in every town and village is a great stumbling block in the way of the village worker.
('68', 117, 1, 3, 220182) Time is not wasted when village workers attempt to find out by experiments what in spite of this handicap are the indigenous sources of procuring an adequate diet.

('68', 117, 4, 6, 220376) APOLOGIES TO VISITORS
('68', 117, 5, 7, 220398) Maganwadi is taxed to its utmost limit.
('68', 117, 5, 8, 220438) It has guest quarters with maximum accommodation for 12. They are principally meant for A. I. V. I. A. Board members and those who are invited for consultation or otherwise by the Chairman or the Secretary.
('68', 117, 5, 9, 220645) But wherever I stay people gravitate from all parts.
('68', 117, 5, 10, 220698) I have made it a rule to ask them so far as possible to share with me what has been put at my disposal.
('68', 117, 5, 11, 220802) The result is that my abode has become a dharmashala without any private quarters.
('68', 117, 5, 12, 220885) In dry weather this is no hardship.
('68', 117, 5, 13, 220921) People sleep on the ample flat roof of the rooms occupied by me and the Board office.
('68', 117, 5, 14, 221007) In the daytime they spread out anyhow.
('68', 117, 5, 15, 221046) Living thus it is not possible for me to find comfortable rooms for an unlimited number of visitors.
('68', 117, 5, 16, 221147) Yet they come without notice and without appointment.
('68', 117, 5, 17, 221201) Add to this the fact that we are working without servants.
('68', 117, 5, 18, 221260) Cooking, washing and cleaning are all done by us.
('68', 117, 5, 19, 221310) The resources of Maganwadi are therefore truly taxed when visitors come as they do without notice.
('68', 117, 5, 20, 221409) I am obliged to refuse them accommodation or food.
('68', 117, 5, 21, 221460) The latter is always cooked according to the number known to be resident the previous night.
('68', 117, 5, 22, 221553) This is all contrary to convention.
('68', 117, 5, 23, 221589) In an Indian household, a chance comer becomes an honoured guest, and he shares what is prepared for the household.
('68', 117, 5, 24, 221705) But Maganwadi is not a household.
('68', 117, 5, 25, 221739) It is a trust created solely for the service of the semi starved unemployed or semi employed millions.
('68', 117, 5, 26, 221842) We are trying in the best manner we know to husband all our resources to save every pice we can.
('68', 117, 5, 27, 221939) We have therefore no warrant for providing a lavish table at which all who come may sit.
('68', 117, 5, 28, 222028) Hence even at the risk of being considered rude or miserly, I am obliged to be very strict and turn away those who come without previous appointment.
('68', 117, 5, 29, 222178) Those who have therefore been, much against my wish, refused hospitality will please extend their sympathy to me
('68', 118, 0, 1, 222291) VOL. 68 : 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 119
('68', 118, 1, 2, 222337) and excuse me.
('68', 118, 1, 3, 222352) Future comers will take note of the peculiar position we are in at Maganwadi.
('68', 118, 1, 4, 222430) I may mention for the convenience of those who must come without notice that within a stone's throw of Maganwadi there is a well appointed dharmashala capable of taking in a fair number of guests.
('68', 118, 1, 5, 222627) It has private quarters too for a limited number.
('68', 118, 1, 6, 222677) I would like to add that in asking for appointments would be comers should have mercy on me.
('68', 118, 1, 7, 222770) It taxes all my strength to cope with the day to day work.
('68', 118, 1, 8, 222829) No appointment should therefore be sought except for the benefit of the tasks which at the moment engage my attention to the exclusion of all else.
('68', 118, 2, 9, 222977) LAJPAT RAI WEEK
('68', 118, 3, 10, 222993) The All India Achhutoddhar Committee, which was started by the late Lala Lajpat Rai, has decided to celebrate a Harijan Week in the revered memory of the Lion of the Punjab as from 11th November to 17th November.
('68', 118, 3, 11, 223206) Besides what local committees may arrange, the A. I. A. C. has circularized the workers in the Harijan cause all over India to observe certain common features.
('68', 118, 3, 12, 223366) They are as follows:
('68', 118, 4, 13, 223387) November 11: Prabhat pheris singing songs impressing upon the minds of all the necessity of treating the Harijans as brothers and sisters, and reciting the services of Lalaji in the Harijan cause.
('68', 118, 5, 14, 223584) November 12: Kathas of religious literature, such as Ramayana, Gita, Bhagawat, etc., to be read in Harijan quarters by purohits and pundits.
('68', 118, 5, 15, 223725) Other Hindus should be invited to these kathas.
('68', 118, 6, 16, 223773) November 13: Panchayats to be held in Harijan quarters or temples to which all groups of the Harijans should be invited.
('68', 118, 6, 17, 223894) Speeches emphasizing removal of untouchability among Harijans themselves and other evil habits.
('68', 118, 7, 18, 223990) November 14: Caste ladies to be persuaded to visit Harijan sisters in their quarters and establish social contacts with them.
('68', 118, 8, 19, 224116) November 15: Baby show.
('68', 118, 8, 20, 224140) Harijan mothers with their babies should be invited to a temple or dharmashala where caste ladies would meet them and award the babies presents and prizes for cleanliness and good health.
('68', 118, 9, 21, 224328) November 16: Games.
('68', 118, 9, 22, 224348) Caste students should fraternize with Harijan students and play with them indigenous games and end with light refreshments.
('68', 118, 9, 23, 224472) Shri Algurai Shastri who has sent circulars to friends informs me that the programme above sketched is subject to change.
('68', 118, 9, 24, 224594) Readers should therefore be ready for alterations that may be sent from headquarters.
('68', 118, 9, 25, 224680) The chief point to remember is that the celebrations
('68', 119, 0, 1, 224733) 120 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('68', 119, 1, 2, 224775) must be fitting to the great cause and the memory of the illustrious patriot and reformer.
('68', 119, 1, 3, 224866) Workers and committees should zealously devote themselves to the success of the celebrations.

('68', 119, 3, 5, 224979) 143. TWO QUESTIONS
('68', 119, 4, 6, 224998) A worker of the Harijan movement has sent me two written questions, of which the first one is: 1
('68', 119, 5, 7, 225095) There is no dilemma here.
('68', 119, 5, 8, 225121) When we take a Harijan into our family circle, we should tell him all the rules of our household at the very beginning.
('68', 119, 5, 9, 225241) He should be told plainly that guests who observe untouchability also visit us and in order not to violate their principles they would be served drinks and other things by us or by the other servants.
('68', 119, 5, 10, 225442) The Bhangi servant who knows this custom of ours will have no cause to feel hurt.
('68', 119, 5, 11, 225524) But the above question implies that because of such behaviour a new problem faces the Bhangi.
('68', 119, 5, 12, 225618) Hence, in such circumstances we should clarify our position to the Bhangi as well as the guest.
('68', 119, 5, 13, 225714) Then neither is deceived and there is no dilemma.
('68', 119, 5, 14, 225764) The second question is this: 2
('68', 119, 6, 15, 225795) If this question relates to an event in the past, then it is quite pointless.
('68', 119, 6, 16, 225873) I can only speak for the future.
('68', 119, 6, 17, 225906) When we invite all communities of Harijans for a feast, they must be informed beforehand that the meals would be cooked and served by Bhangi Harijans only.
('68', 119, 6, 18, 226062) If we do not make this clear, then we are certainly guilty of practising deception.
('68', 119, 6, 19, 226146) We should never forget the fact that the poison of untouchability has permeated Harijans as well.
('68', 119, 7, 20, 226244) [From Hindi] Harijan Sevak, 2 11 1935
('68', 119, 8, 21, 226282) 1 Not reproduced here.
('68', 119, 8, 22, 226305) The worker had asked whether he should let his Harijan servant serve his guests.
('68', 119, 8, 23, 226386) 2 Not reproduced here.
('68', 119, 8, 24, 226409) It asked whether guests at dinner parties for Harijans should be forewarned about the caste of the cooks, etc.

('68', 121, 4, 9, 228127) 147. A FATAL FALLACY 1
('68', 121, 5, 10, 228150) Among the questions that a correspondent asked me for discussion in Harijan there was one which I have kept on my file for some time:
('68', 121, 6, 11, 228284) Don't you think that it is impossible to achieve any great reform without winning political power?
('68', 121, 6, 12, 228383) The present economic structure has also got to be tackled.
('68', 121, 6, 13, 228442) No reconstruction is possible without a political reconstruction and I am afraid all this talk of polished and unpolished rice, balanced diet and so on and so forth is mere moonshine.
('68', 121, 6, 14, 228626) I have often heard this argument advanced as an excuse for failure to do many things.
('68', 121, 6, 15, 228712) I admit that there are certain things which cannot be done without political power, but there are numerous other things which do not at all depend upon political power.
('68', 121, 6, 16, 228881) That is why a thinker like Thoreau said that that government is the best which governs the least. This means that when people come into possession of political power, the interference with the freedom of people is reduced to a minimum.
('68', 121, 6, 17, 229117) In other words, a nation that runs its affairs smoothly and effectively without much State interference is truly democratic.
('68', 121, 6, 18, 229242) Where such a condition is absent, the form of government is democratic in name.
('68', 121, 6, 19, 229322) There is certainly no limit or restraint on the freedom of thought.
('68', 121, 6, 20, 229390) It may be remembered that many reformers are nowadays laying the greatest emphasis on a new ideology.
('68', 121, 6, 21, 229492) How few of us are going in for any reform in our opinions?
('68', 121, 6, 22, 229551) Modern scientists recognize the potency of thought and that is why it is said that as a man thinks so does he become.
('68', 121, 6, 23, 229669) One who always thinks of murder will turn a murderer, and one who thinks of incest will be incestuous.
('68', 121, 6, 24, 229772) On the contrary he who always thinks of truth and non violence will be
('68', 121, 7, 25, 229843) 1 The Gujarati original appeared in Harijanbandhu, 3 11 1935.
('68', 122, 0, 1, 229905) VOL. 68 : 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 123
('68', 122, 1, 2, 229951) truthful and non violent, and he whose thoughts are fixed on God will be godly.
('68', 122, 1, 3, 230031) In this realm of thought political power does not come into play at all.
('68', 122, 1, 4, 230104) Even so it must be obvious that political power or want of it is of no consequence in many of our activities.
('68', 122, 1, 5, 230214) I would make a humble suggestion to the correspondent.
('68', 122, 1, 6, 230269) Let him make a detailed note of all his daily activities and he is sure to find that many of them are performed independently of any political power.
('68', 122, 1, 7, 230419) Man has to thank himself for his dependence.
('68', 122, 1, 8, 230464) He can be independent as soon as he wills it.
('68', 122, 1, 9, 230510) The correspondent has raised the bugbear of great reform and then fought shy of it.
('68', 122, 1, 10, 230594) He who is not ready for small reforms will never be ready for great reforms.
('68', 122, 1, 11, 230671) He who makes the best of his faculties will go on augmenting them, and he will find that what once seemed to him a great reform was really a small one.
('68', 122, 1, 12, 230823) He who orders his life in this way will lead a truly natural life.
('68', 122, 1, 13, 230890) One must forget the political goal in order to realize it.
('68', 122, 1, 14, 230949) To think in terms of the political goal in every matter and at every step is to raise unnecessary dust.
('68', 122, 1, 15, 231053) Why worry one's head over a thing that is inevitable?
('68', 122, 1, 16, 231107) Why die before one's death?
('68', 122, 1, 17, 231135) That is why I can take the keenest interest in discussing vitamins and leafy vegetables and unpolished rice.
('68', 122, 1, 18, 231244) That is why it has become a matter of absorbing interest to me to find out how best to clean our latrines, how best to save our people from the heinous sin of fouling Mother Earth every morning.
('68', 122, 1, 19, 231439) I do not quite see how thinking of these necessary problems and finding a solution for them has no political significance and how an examination of the financial policy of Government has necessarily a political bearing.
('68', 122, 1, 20, 231659) What I am clear about is that the work I am doing and asking the masses to do is such as can be done by millions of people, whereas the work of examining the policy of our rulers will be beyond them.
('68', 122, 1, 21, 231859) That it is a few people's business I will not dispute.
('68', 122, 1, 22, 231914) Let those who are qualified to do so do it as best as they can.
('68', 122, 1, 23, 231978) But until these leaders can bring great changes into being, why should not millions like me use the gifts that God has given them to the best advantage?
('68', 122, 1, 24, 232131) Why should they not make their bodies fitter instruments of service?
('68', 122, 1, 25, 232200) Why should not they clear their own doors and environments of dirt and filth?
('68', 122, 1, 26, 232278) Why should they be always in the grip of disease and incapable of helping themselves or anyone else?
('68', 122, 1, 27, 232379) No, I am afraid the correspondents question betrays his laziness and despair and the depression that has overtaken many of us.
('68', 123, 0, 1, 232506) 124 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('68', 123, 1, 2, 232548) confidently claim that I yield to none in my passion for freedom.
('68', 123, 1, 3, 232614) No fatigue or depression has seized me.
('68', 123, 1, 4, 232654) Many years experience has convinced me that the activities that absorb my energies and attention are calculated to achieve the nation's freedom, that therein lies the secret of non violent freedom.
('68', 123, 1, 5, 232852) That is why I invite everyone, men and women, young and old, to contribute his or her share to the great sacrifice.

('68', 123, 2, 7, 232987) 148. SOME WAYS OF SERVING THE COW
('68', 123, 3, 8, 233021) Shri Purushottam Narhar Joshi who calls himself a worker in the cause of the cow writes as follow: 1
('68', 123, 4, 9, 233122) This letter deserves consideration.
('68', 123, 4, 10, 233158) Only an institution can put into practice the suggestions made in it.
('68', 123, 4, 11, 233228) Some of them can be implemented by Government authority alone.
('68', 123, 4, 12, 233291) However, every reader of Harijanbandhu can implement one point.
('68', 123, 4, 13, 233355) He should use nothing but cow's milk and ghee made from cows milk.
('68', 123, 4, 14, 233422) Cows milk is better and more nourishing than buffalos milk.
('68', 123, 4, 15, 233482) Nothing but cows milk should be given to children.
('68', 123, 4, 16, 233533) Ghee made from this is easier to digest.
('68', 123, 4, 17, 233574) The testimony of doctors and vaids regarding these two points has already been published in Harijanbandhu.
('68', 123, 4, 18, 233681) Despite this, many people use buffalo's milk and ghee made from it for the sake of their taste.
('68', 123, 4, 19, 233777) Some others, while prepared to drink cows milk, are not ready to use ghee made from it.
('68', 123, 4, 20, 233865) They claim that the ghee made from buffalo's milk alone is good.
('68', 123, 4, 21, 233930) It is whiter in appearance and is thicker in consistency.
('68', 123, 4, 22, 233988) Many people who have become accustomed to its appearance and taste are not ready to give it up for the sake of the cow or the country.
('68', 123, 4, 23, 234123) In fact the whiteness and the consistency of ghee made from buffalo's milk are themselves points against it.
('68', 123, 4, 24, 234232) It seems impossible to keep both the cow and the buffalo alive.
('68', 123, 4, 25, 234296) If the buffalo is to survive, the cow must perish.
('68', 123, 4, 26, 234347) The buffalo is dying even now.
('68', 123, 4, 27, 234378) It is because we deliberately permit the slaughter of he buffaloes that the she buffalo survives.
('68', 123, 4, 28, 234476) If, therefore, we remain negligent, we shall be instrumental in destroying both the cow and the buffalo and shall become dependent upon milk and butter imported from countries where thousands of cows are slaughtered daily and not a single cow is even allowed to grow old.

('68', 124, 1, 3, 234985) Shri Joshi refers to the Goseva Sangh.
('68', 124, 1, 4, 235024) That organization is not defunct; there are some members who still belong to it.
('68', 124, 1, 5, 235105) One may say that its activities as an organization are very few, nevertheless it does continue to exist.
('68', 124, 1, 6, 235210) A few individual go sevaks are being trained.

('68', 124, 1, 10, 235425) Attempts are being made to demonstrate such results.
('68', 124, 1, 11, 235478) God alone knows what will happen in the future.
('68', 124, 1, 12, 235526) There is no doubt that much can be accomplished if the Indian States start implementing Shri Joshis suggestions.
('68', 124, 1, 13, 235639) Even if the work is taken up on a large scale and in a co ordinated manner in the States of Kathiawar alone, it cannot but succeed.
('68', 124, 1, 14, 235771) And once its success is demonstrated, it cannot but spread to other parts.
('68', 124, 1, 15, 235846) Shri Joshi fails to mention that a tannery is an important instrument in saving the cow.
('68', 124, 1, 16, 235935) As this has been often repeated in Harijanbandhu,I do not mention it here again.

('68', 127, 2, 3, 239079) November 6, 1935
('68', 127, 3, 4, 239096) DEAR SRINIVASARAO,
('68', 127, 4, 5, 239115) I have a vivid recollection of our meeting at Bijapur but none of your letter.
('68', 127, 4, 6, 239194) All my secretaries were not secretaries but youngsters who were doing their very best to share my burden.
('68', 127, 4, 7, 239300) Mahadev himself was in the Belgaum jail.
('68', 127, 4, 8, 239341) But to show how much I value your letters and your co operation, whenever you can give it to me, I hasten to reply per return.
('68', 127, 5, 9, 239468) 1. The story of Rama and Ravana is to my mind an allegory.
('68', 127, 5, 10, 239527) In my preface to Anasaktiyoga I have explained what I understand by incarnation.
('68', 127, 5, 11, 239608) What Rama used were spiritual weapons, i.e., satyagraha against the material weapons of the ten headed Ravana.
('68', 127, 5, 12, 239719) There is intrinsic support in Tulsidass Ramayana for this interpretation.
('68', 127, 5, 13, 239793) 2. The verse you quote from the Bhagavad Gita, in my opinion, emphasizes the interpretation that I have put upon the whole teaching of the Gita, namely, that when a man has lost his egotism and his
('68', 127, 6, 14, 239991) 1 The addressee, in his letter dated November 1, had asked: (1) When Ravana carried away Sita, why did not Shri Rama practise satyagraha instead of going to Lanka and destroying Ravana?
('68', 127, 6, 15, 240177) (2) Shri Krishna, the author of the Bhagavad Gita which you have annotated, says:
('68', 127, 7, 16, 240259) [XVIII.
('68', 127, 7, 17, 240267) 17] Not only did he say this but helped, though himself unarmed, the Pandavas to conquer the Kauravas after a bloody battle in which millions of warriors were killed, frequently with the power of his brain which proved superior to material weapons, in order to gain their birth right.
('68', 127, 7, 18, 240552) Does this not show that Shri Krishna did believe in the destruction of evil rather than in its reform by peaceful methods?
('68', 127, 7, 19, 240675) (3) When Vishwamitra proceeded to snatch away Kamadhenu by force and when she complained to her master Vasishtha, the latter told her that he was precluded by his vow from getting angry or retaliating, but at the same time permitted her to protect herself against the outrage.
('68', 127, 7, 20, 240952) Thereon soldiers fully armed cropped up from every hair of hers and routed the army of Vishwamitra with great slaughter.
('68', 127, 7, 21, 241073) Why did not Vasishtha permit her to be taken by Vishwamitra?
('68', 127, 7, 22, 241134) Why did he not practise satyagraha to retain her by peaceful means?
('68', 127, 7, 23, 241202) (4) It is said that Buddha died of poisoned animal food offered to him by a devotee.
('68', 127, 7, 24, 241287) We find all his followers to be flesh eaters.
('68', 127, 7, 25, 241333) How is this consistent with ahimsa?
('68', 127, 7, 26, 241369) (5) Is there any instance in history where evil unreformable evilwas conquered by good only by peaceful means?
('68', 128, 0, 1, 241480) VOL. 68 : 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 129
('68', 128, 1, 2, 241526) intellect remains untarnished, what though he should kill all life.
('68', 128, 1, 3, 241594) In other words, such a person would be incapable of killing.
('68', 128, 1, 4, 241655) 3. My interpretation of the version of Kamadhenu is hat the rage of Vishwamitra was impotent to touch even a single hair of the Kamadhenu.
('68', 128, 1, 5, 241794) It is an illustration of the famous saying that God is the help of the helpless.
('68', 128, 1, 6, 241875) 4. Eating of animal food as a matter of habit is not inconsistent with the observance of ahimsa, even as eating milk and vegetable which have also life is not inconsistent with the practice of ahimsa.
('68', 128, 1, 7, 242076) I have elsewhere argued that practice of absolute ahimsa by embodied life is an utter impossibility.
('68', 128, 1, 8, 242177) 5. Perhaps your question is not properly put.
('68', 128, 1, 9, 242223) There can be no question of conquering evil.
('68', 128, 1, 10, 242268) Evil will always retain its quality but what we endeavour always is to induce our companions, even as we try ourselves, to rid them and us of evil.
('68', 128, 1, 11, 242416) Is not history replete with instances of men and women, the most evilminded, being reformed by an appeal to their higher natures?
('68', 128, 1, 12, 242546) I have not entered into an elaborate argument because I assume that you will take the trouble of procuring a copy of my introduction to Anasaktiyoga.
('68', 128, 1, 13, 242696) It is translated into MarathiI believe also in Kanarese.
('68', 128, 1, 14, 242753) An English translation was published in the pages of Young India, but so far as I am aware it has never been published in book form as yet.

('68', 128, 8, 22, 243084) I have your letter after a long wait.
('68', 128, 8, 23, 243122) The surprising thing is that in America you did not receive even one letter of mine.
('68', 128, 8, 24, 243207) You should have received at least three.
('68', 128, 8, 25, 243248) I have the dates of posting.
('68', 128, 8, 26, 243277) These shall be given at the end of this letter as they have to be traced in the diary.

('68', 129, 1, 2, 243406) But our agreement stipulated your writing every week irrespective of my writing or not writing.
('68', 129, 1, 3, 243502) It is possible that I may have nothing much to say while you must always have something new to write about.
('68', 129, 1, 4, 243610) Anyway, let bygones be bygones.
('68', 129, 1, 5, 243642) Now I shall expect a letter from you every week.
('68', 129, 1, 6, 243691) I have also made it a practice to send on your letters to Draupadi and Ramdas; to the latter because of his specific request and to the former just by the way.
('68', 129, 1, 7, 243851) It has brought forth one result, namely, that Draupadi is obliged to write in reply.
('68', 129, 1, 8, 243936) Otherwise would she have at all written to me?
('68', 129, 1, 9, 243983) I did not expect you to pay your way so soon in America but I did hold that it would not be difficult to live on modest means.
('68', 129, 1, 10, 244110) Anyway, now that you are there you may stay on till you are satisfied.
('68', 129, 1, 11, 244181) You should leave only when you feel that you have nothing further to learn regarding nature cure.
('68', 129, 1, 12, 244279) The experiences of America will be almost repeated in England.
('68', 129, 1, 13, 244342) There, too, you will not find much by way of nature cure but it was imperative that you visit the West.
('68', 129, 1, 14, 244446) Quite a few misconceptions persist until experience drives them out.
('68', 129, 1, 15, 244515) From this angle I do not regard your trip unproductive.
('68', 129, 1, 16, 244571) Do see Sheltons place if you have not visited it so far; Govind waxed eloquent over it.
('68', 129, 1, 17, 244659) His Health School is situated in San Antonio, Texas.
('68', 129, 1, 18, 244712) You must have got the letter for England which I sent at your request.
('68', 129, 1, 19, 244783) You ask me what I meant by saying that you would open out in America.
('68', 129, 1, 20, 244853) I meant that the slight eccentricity or say a kind of kink that you possessed would be straightened out there and that you would develop the habit of living well adjusted to others.
('68', 129, 1, 21, 245035) Your account has been received.
('68', 129, 1, 22, 245067) You should keep up correspondence with Bhai Brijmohanji but you need not send him an account of your expenses.
('68', 129, 1, 23, 245178) You must have got the Harijan issues.
('68', 129, 1, 24, 245216) They have been sent so far to Dr. Holmes's address as also my letters but this letter I am sending to Dr. Kelloggs address.
('68', 129, 1, 25, 245340) I have already forwarded to you the letter I received from Dr. Kellogg.
('68', 129, 1, 26, 245412) What advice can I give you from here regarding your health except that you should be well protected against the cold and should walk daily at least ten miles?
('68', 129, 1, 27, 245571) You should partake liberally of milk and fruit and eat salads prepared from greens.
('68', 129, 1, 28, 245655) This much should ensure good health; and keep up the breathing exercises.

('68', 131, 4, 11, 246963) The music in that place is also reputed to be excellent.
('68', 131, 4, 12, 247020) Learn it well.
('68', 131, 4, 13, 247035) I do hope that you will learn Tamil at any rate, and will also propagate Hindi there.
('68', 131, 4, 14, 247121) Reduce your weight too.
('68', 131, 4, 15, 247145) In short, since you have gone to such a distant place prove yourself worthy of the great, although mono syllabic, name 2
('68', 131, 5, 16, 247266) which you sport.
('68', 131, 5, 17, 247283) There must be some meaning in your owning a name which, the Shastras say, leads to spiritual welfare.
('68', 131, 5, 18, 247385) I want you to justify this belief.
('68', 131, 5, 19, 247420) You do possess some of the virtues symbolized in this syllable.
('68', 131, 5, 20, 247484) If you acquire a few more, you will need nothing else.
('68', 131, 5, 21, 247539) I will also tell you another thing, in case you do not know it.
('68', 131, 5, 22, 247603) Sanskrit words are spoken with perfect pronunciation in Tamilnad as in Maharashtra.
('68', 131, 5, 23, 247687) Maharashtra is good in repect of pronunciation but the quality of music is not so high.
('68', 131, 5, 24, 247775) In Tamilnad, the Sanskrit mantras, etc., are recited melodiously and in a sweet voice.
('68', 131, 5, 25, 247862) You can learn all this with Ambujam's help.
('68', 131, 5, 26, 247906) All this can be learnt with little trouble.
('68', 131, 5, 27, 247950) It will not be necessary to spend much time over it.
('68', 131, 5, 28, 248003) May this year prove good for you.
('68', 131, 5, 29, 248037) Now that you have started writing, please keep up the practice and write to me from time to time.

('68', 132, 2, 3, 248463) Many a time have I rehearsed to myself what I should do if I were a member of a corporation, and when years ago I used to walk through the streets of Calcutta and compare the palaces with their beautiful and sanitary surroundings with the ugliness and want of sanitation of its slums, I used to say to myself that the work and worth of the Corporation of Calcutta should be measured not by the number or beauty of its palaces, but by the condition of its slums, and I felt that then the Corporation had neglected its duties.

('68', 132, 4, 5, 249007) 159. MEDICAL RELIEF
('68', 132, 5, 6, 249027) Medical relief as part of village work or social service plays an important part in many reports I receive from numerous organizations.
('68', 132, 5, 7, 249163) This relief consists of medicines supplied to patients who from far and near flock to any person who advertises himself as distributor of such relief.
('68', 132, 5, 8, 249314) It means no trouble on the part of the medicine man.
('68', 132, 5, 9, 249367) He need not have much or any knowledge of diseases and the symptoms.
('68', 132, 5, 10, 249436) Medicines he often receives free from obliging chemists.
('68', 132, 5, 11, 249493) Donations are always to be had from indiscriminate donors whose conscience is satisified if they can distribute their charity in aid of suffering humanity.
('68', 132, 5, 12, 249649) This social service has appeared to me to be the laziest form of service and often even mischievous.
('68', 132, 5, 13, 249750) It works mischief when the patient is expected to do nothing save to swallow the drug given to him.
('68', 132, 5, 14, 249850) He is none the wiser for having received the medicine.
('68', 132, 5, 15, 249905) If anything, he is worse off than before.
('68', 132, 5, 16, 249947) The knowledge that he can get for nothing, or for a trifle, a pill or a potion that will correct certain irregularities will tempt him to repeat them.
('68', 132, 5, 17, 250098) The fact that he gets such aid free of charge will undermine his self respect which should disdain to receive anything for nothing.
('68', 132, 5, 18, 250230) There is another type of medical relief which is a boon.
('68', 132, 6, 19, 250287) 1 A.V. Thakkar's article which appeared along with this note is not reproduced here.
('68', 133, 0, 1, 250372) 134 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('68', 133, 1, 2, 250414) given by those who know the nature of diseases, who will tell the patients why they have their particular complaints and will also tell them how to avoid them.
('68', 133, 1, 3, 250574) Such servants will rush to assist at all odd hours of the day or night.
('68', 133, 1, 4, 250646) Such discriminating relief is an education in hygiene, teaching the people how to observe cleanliness and to gain health.
('68', 133, 1, 5, 250768) But such service is rare.
('68', 133, 1, 6, 250794) In the majority of cases mention of medical relief in reports is a piece of advertisement leading to don ations for other activities requiring perhaps as little exertion or knowledge as medical relief.
('68', 133, 1, 7, 250996) I would therefore urge all workers in the social field, whether urban or rural, to treat their medical activity as the least important item of service.
('68', 133, 1, 8, 251148) It would be better to aviod all mention of such relief.
('68', 133, 1, 9, 251204) Workers would do well to adopt measures that would prevent disease in their localities.
('68', 133, 1, 10, 251292) Their stock of medicines should be as small as possible.
('68', 133, 1, 11, 251349) They should study the bazaar medicines available in their villages, know their reputed properties, and use them as far as possible.
('68', 133, 1, 12, 251481) They will find as we are finding in Sindi that hot water, sunshine, clean salt and soda with an occasional use of castor oil or quinine answer most purposes.
('68', 133, 1, 13, 251639) We make it a point to send all serious cases to the Civil Hospital.
('68', 133, 1, 14, 251707) Patients flock to Mirabehn and receive lessons in hygiene and prevention of diseases.
('68', 133, 1, 15, 251793) They do not resent this method of approach instead of simply being given a powder or a mixture.

('68', 133, 4, 18, 251924) Inquiries are being made as to where soya beans are to be had and how they are to be sown and in what ways they are to be cooked.
('68', 133, 4, 19, 252054) The leaflet published by the Bombay Health Association was condensed in these columns only recently.
('68', 133, 4, 20, 252155) I now give below a free translation of the main parts of a Gujarati leaflet published by the Baroda State Food Survey Office.
('68', 133, 4, 21, 252281) Its cost is one pice:
('68', 133, 5, 22, 252303) Soya beans grow on a plant from one foot to fifteen inches in height.
('68', 133, 5, 23, 252373) Every pod has on an average three beans.
('68', 133, 5, 24, 252414) The plant has many varieties.
('68', 133, 5, 25, 252444) The bean may be white, yellow, blackish, variegated, etc.
('68', 133, 5, 26, 252502) The yellow variety has the largest percentage of protein and fat.
('68', 133, 5, 27, 252568) This variety is more nutritious than meat or eggs.
('68', 133, 5, 28, 252619) The Chinese eat beans with rice.
('68', 133, 5, 29, 252652) Soya bean flour may be mixed with ordinary flour in the proportion of one to five parts of wheat and turned

('68', 134, 1, 2, 252805) into chapatis.
('68', 134, 2, 3, 252820) Soya bean crop improves the soil.
('68', 134, 2, 4, 252854) Instead of deriving nitrogen like other plants from the soil, soya bean derives it from the air and thus enriches the soil.
('68', 134, 3, 5, 252978) Soya bean grows in practically all soils.
('68', 134, 3, 6, 253020) It thrives most in soils favourable to cotton or grain crops.
('68', 134, 3, 7, 253082) Slat soil improves if soya bean is sown in it.
('68', 134, 3, 8, 253129) In such soil more manure should be used.
('68', 134, 3, 9, 253170) Fermented cowdung, grass, leaves and dungheap manure are quite serviceable for this crop.
('68', 134, 4, 10, 253260) Temperate climate suits the bean.
('68', 134, 4, 11, 253294) It thrives where the rainfall is not more than 40 inches.
('68', 134, 4, 12, 253352) It should not be sown in water logged soil.
('68', 134, 4, 13, 253396) The bean is generally sown after the frist rains, but it can be sown during any season.
('68', 134, 4, 14, 253484) In the dry season it requires to be watered once a week, or twice if the soil is inclined to dry quickly.
('68', 134, 5, 15, 253590) The soil is best prepared in summer.
('68', 134, 5, 16, 253627) It should be ploughed up and exposed to the suns rays.
('68', 134, 5, 17, 253682) Then the clods should be broken up and pulverized.
('68', 134, 6, 18, 253733) The seed should be sown in rows twenty four to thrity six inches apart.
('68', 134, 6, 19, 253805) The plants should be three to four inches apart in their rows.
('68', 134, 6, 20, 253868) There should be frequent weeding.
('68', 134, 7, 21, 253902) One acre would take from 20 to 30 lb.
('68', 134, 7, 22, 253940) of seeds.
('68', 134, 7, 23, 253950) They should not be sown deeper than two inches.
('68', 134, 7, 24, 253998) One acre will require about 10 cartloads of manure.
('68', 134, 8, 25, 254050) After the sprouting of the seeds there shoud be proper weeding with a light plough.
('68', 134, 8, 26, 254134) All crust should be broken up.
('68', 134, 9, 27, 254165) The pods are ready for picking in 120 days after sowing.
('68', 134, 9, 28, 254222) They should be picked as soon as the leaves begin to turn yellow and drop off.
('68', 134, 9, 29, 254301) They should not be allowed to be on the plants till they open, or else the seeds will drop out and be lost in the soil.
('68', 134, 10, 30, 254421) So much for the Gap.
('68', 134, 10, 31, 254442) Now a word as to the results of the experiment being made in Maganwadi.
('68', 134, 10, 32, 254514) It is too early to draw deductions as yet.
('68', 134, 10, 33, 254557) It may be said that the weight of the inmates has kept constant.
('68', 134, 10, 34, 254622) In a few cases there has been a decided increasein one case as much as 41 2 b.
('68', 134, 10, 35, 254701) in a fortnight.
('68', 134, 10, 36, 254717) Ghee has been stopped since the close of the first week.
('68', 134, 10, 37, 254774) The absence of it has yet made no impression on the weight.
('68', 134, 10, 38, 254834) One ounce of oil is being issued instead.
('68', 134, 10, 39, 254876) The ration of beans has been increased for the current week from two ounces to three per head.
('68', 134, 10, 40, 254971) The bean is served both morning and evening.
('68', 134, 10, 41, 255016) They are soaked for some hours and then cooked well.
('68', 134, 10, 42, 255069) Water in which it is steamed is strained out and tamarind
('68', 135, 0, 1, 255127) 136 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('68', 135, 1, 2, 255169) and salt added to it.
('68', 135, 1, 3, 255191) It makes a very popular soup.
('68', 135, 1, 4, 255221) To the bean after straining are added linseed or til oil and salt making a tasty dish.
('68', 135, 1, 5, 255308) In the morning the bean is served with chapati or bhakhari and in the evening with rice.
('68', 135, 1, 6, 255397) The bean requires to be chewed well.
('68', 135, 1, 7, 255434) NO ill effect has yet been reported.
('68', 135, 1, 8, 255471) The bean is obtainable in Bombay and Baroda.
('68', 135, 1, 9, 255516) Negotiations are being carried on for a reduction in the price.
('68', 135, 1, 10, 255580) Meanwhile small quantities can be had from Maganwadi at three annas per pound, railage extra.
('68', 135, 1, 11, 255674) This price is prohibitive.
('68', 135, 1, 12, 255701) By some mistake our beans were received from Baroda by passenger train instead of goods.
('68', 135, 1, 13, 255790) My advice to senders is not yet to order the beans from Maganwadi Godrej and Co.
('68', 135, 1, 14, 255871) (Parel, Bombay) supply the beans in Bombay and the Baroda Food Survey Office in Baroda.

('68', 136, 4, 5, 256966) I saw your letter only last night, because Kaka had forgotten [to hand it over to me].
('68', 136, 4, 6, 257053) It will be good if you can anyhow persuade Bhai Velchand to start paying Rs. 500 a month.
('68', 136, 4, 7, 257143) In fact, he should have started doing so as soon as he had decided to do so.
('68', 136, 4, 8, 257220) It is good news that Vanu 1 has recovered completely.
('68', 136, 4, 9, 257274) Her leaving the Vidyapith is a great act of renunciation.
('68', 136, 4, 10, 257332) But it will endure only if her attachment for the Vidyapith is dead.
('68', 136, 4, 11, 257401) I hope you haven't in any way coerced her into taking the step.
('68', 136, 4, 12, 257465) Otherwise she will always repent it afterwards and will continue to nurse the desire in her heart.
('68', 136, 4, 13, 257564) If, however, the arrangement that you have made endures, the work being done there will shine out very well.
('68', 136, 4, 14, 257673) It won't be in my hands to arrange where I will stay.
('68', 136, 4, 15, 257727) I believe it will be done by the Sahitya [Parishad].
('68', 136, 4, 16, 257780) See the person in charge and do what may be necessary.

('68', 138, 12, 16, 260729) I learnt only today from Narandass letter that you were running fever.
('68', 138, 12, 17, 260800) Your letter came later.
('68', 138, 12, 18, 260824) It seems you have not properly understood the point of what I have written to Jethalal 3. I did disapprove of Bharatan 4 getting Rs. 50. Howerver, he had given up a post of Rs. 300 a month and even now he can get a job which would bring him the same income or even more.
('68', 138, 12, 19, 261095) From the Rs. 50 which he takes, he gives as much as half to a poor student whom he supports.
('68', 138, 12, 20, 261188) Bhai Jethalal is looking for some other job or occupation and will leave the work of the Seva Sangh as as soon he gets any.
('68', 138, 12, 21, 261312) I had clearly seen this.
('68', 138, 12, 22, 261337) I hope you will be able to see the difference between the two cases.
('68', 138, 12, 23, 261406) Those of you who take more than Jethalal does have dedicated yourselves to public work and your

('68', 141, 7, 10, 264865) I got your letter, Swaraj is definitely connected with politics.
('68', 141, 7, 11, 264930) But many an activity can have its roots in swaraj, and not in politics.
('68', 141, 7, 12, 265002) For example, I would definitely regard it your contribution, however small, to the winning of swaraj if you all three brothers 1 engage yourselves in businessat present not for your own benefit but to help your father 2 and to pay off his debts.
('68', 141, 7, 13, 265248) Please remember that our means of winning swaraj are non violent and doing ones dharma is the most important of non violent means.

('68', 146, 2, 3, 270763) November 14, 1935
('68', 146, 3, 4, 270781) BHAI VALLABHBHAI, You must be strong enough now to talk and shout [in your usual manner].
('68', 146, 3, 5, 270871) I went through your letter to Ambedkar.
('68', 146, 3, 6, 270911) It is apt but is not likely to have any effect on him at present.
('68', 146, 3, 7, 270977) He cannot help abusing me how can he spare you, than?
('68', 146, 3, 8, 271031) Here, as in London, there are several influences acting on him from behind.
('68', 146, 3, 9, 271107) The pity of it is that the problem has been given exaggerated importance because of his threats.
('68', 146, 3, 10, 271204) Even that wouldt matter, were it not that instead of explo iting the situation for constructive work people are going about the wrong way to solve it.
('68', 146, 3, 11, 271355) Instead of making a determined effort for the eradi cation of untouchability, they are trying to win over Ambedkar with appeals and entreaties.
('68', 146, 3, 12, 271499) But let it be; this is the atmosphere in which we have to work.
('68', 146, 3, 13, 271563) Look where you will, you find nothing but an exhi bition of fear and weakness.
('68', 146, 3, 14, 271642) Cant you take some steps regarding Patadi?
('68', 146, 3, 15, 271685) Is it right for your secretary to preside over any sort of meeting without your permission?
('68', 146, 4, 16, 271777) I hope you understand now the position about my programme in Gujarat in the month of January.
('68', 146, 4, 17, 271871) As the 12th is fixed for my arrival in Ahmedabad, so the 28th is fixed for my return to Wardha, for on that day Radhakrishna 2 and Anasuya 3 are getting married.
('68', 146, 4, 18, 272033) I must, therefore, return here at the latest on that day.
('68', 146, 4, 19, 272091) I can thus give to gujarat 14 days at the most.
('68', 146, 4, 20, 272139) You may arrange whatever is possible within that period.

('68', 147, 3, 4, 272715) AVADHESH,
('68', 147, 4, 5, 272725) I have your letter after a long time.
('68', 147, 4, 6, 272763) Why have you not yet taken up some definite work?
('68', 147, 4, 7, 272813) In order to be fearless we should love all and adhere to the path of truth.
('68', 147, 4, 8, 272889) The assertion that goodness is easier to come by is based on the fact that all wish to be known as good people and no one wants to be known as a sinner.
('68', 147, 4, 9, 273042) Therefore it can be said that to be a sinner is difficult!

('68', 147, 11, 15, 273221) I have your letter.
('68', 147, 11, 16, 273241) As soon as the German card was placed in Mahadevs hand he redirected it and you got it.
('68', 147, 11, 17, 273329) There seems to have been no avoidable delay in redirecting it to you.
('68', 147, 11, 18, 273399) It was first addressed to you at Bombay.
('68', 147, 11, 19, 273440) From there it was redirected to the Ashram, not Maganwadi.
('68', 147, 11, 20, 273499) At the Ashram, there is anarchy at present because the whole thing is being reconstructed.
('68', 147, 11, 21, 273590) No one can tell when ultimately the card was brought here.
('68', 147, 11, 22, 273649) You must careflly study the five postel stamps on it.
('68', 147, 11, 23, 273703) Examine the dates, and perhaps you will solve the mystery of the delay.
('68', 147, 11, 24, 273775) Such misfortunes are inevitable and you are able to stand greater ones.
('68', 147, 11, 25, 273847) I am glad your income is increasing by leaps and bounds.
('68', 147, 11, 26, 273904) No wonder you like Bombay.
('68', 147, 11, 27, 273931) You must not count the cost of your food but take whatever is necessary to keep you in perfect health.
('68', 147, 11, 28, 274034) With Khurshedbehn at your back you will be quite all right.

('68', 148, 7, 11, 274497) Your letter remained unattended to till today.
('68', 148, 7, 12, 274544) You are observing your vow well enough.
('68', 148, 7, 13, 274584) With a firm mind you will go farther.
('68', 148, 7, 14, 274622) The food seems to be quite all right, except that it is deficient in green leaves and vegetables.
('68', 148, 7, 15, 274720) You must include some fresh raw leaves.
('68', 148, 7, 16, 274760) You should grow them yourself.

('68', 149, 7, 12, 275502) In answer to certain questions Dr. Aykroyd, Director of Nutrition Research, sends the following interesting replies:
('68', 149, 8, 13, 275619) You ask about food values.
('68', 149, 8, 14, 275646) Data on this point are being rapidly gathered here and elsewhere in India, and I hope that at no very distant period an authoritative book or pamphlet giving the chemical composition, vitamin, potency, etc., of all common foods will become available for those interested in dietetics.
('68', 149, 8, 15, 275931) I have little doubt that you are right in stating that in practice different vegetable fats and oils produce different physiological effects.
('68', 149, 8, 16, 276073) This is probably due to their chemical make up, but unfortunately we are not yet in a position to correlate chemical composition and dietary effect in this case.
('68', 149, 8, 17, 276235) In all probability some research worker somewhere in the world will soon enlighten us.
('68', 149, 9, 18, 276322) We have analysed neem leaves in the laboratory.
('68', 149, 9, 19, 276370) As compared with a number of other green vegetable previously investigated, they have a high nutritive value.
('68', 149, 9, 20, 276480) Both mature and tender leaves are rich in protein, calcium, iron and vitamin A activity and are superior in these respects to amaranth leaves, coriander leaves, drumstick leaves, lettuce, murraya leaves, and spinach.
('68', 149, 9, 21, 276697) This perhaps explains the tradition of their high nutritive value.
('68', 149, 9, 22, 276764) I believe that modern laboratory investigations in China have not infrequently domonstrated that herbs and other types of food recommended in ancient Chinese books are rich in vitamins, etc.
('68', 149, 10, 23, 276955) With regard to vitamin content, tamarind and lemon are roughly similar, except that the latter is richer in the antiscorbutic vitamin C. Tamarind plup, unlike lemon, contains a good deal of tartaric acidabout 14%; the chief acid
('68', 150, 0, 1, 277184) VOL. 68: 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 151
('68', 150, 1, 2, 277229) in lemon is citric acid.
('68', 150, 1, 3, 277254) Otherwise the two fruits resemble each other in food value.
('68', 150, 1, 4, 277314) Tamarind is stated to contain a laxative principle.
('68', 150, 1, 5, 277366) I can offer nothing in support of the popular belief that it induces fever and rheumatism.
('68', 150, 1, 6, 277457) The reader should know that I have been making extensive experiments in neem leaves and tamarind.
('68', 150, 1, 7, 277555) Neem leaves have been taken with impunity by several.
('68', 150, 1, 8, 277609) My difficulty has been to make them palatable.
('68', 150, 1, 9, 277656) Taken in the form of chutney containing sufficient tamarind pulp and salt or lemon and salt, it is least objectionable.
('68', 150, 1, 10, 277776) Some take two to three tolas of whole leaves with relish.
('68', 150, 1, 11, 277834) I am unable to say definitely what effect the taking of leaves produces on the system.
('68', 150, 1, 12, 277921) I have been tempting volunteers to try them because of the high merit attributed in Ayurveda to them and because of their decidedly good effect on Shri Bhansali 1. Their common use would enable the poor people without extra cost to take the green leaves upon which modern diet experts lay much stress.
('68', 150, 1, 13, 278223) That the use of the leaf produces no ill effect can be stated with perfect confidence.
('68', 150, 1, 14, 278310) Of the good effect of tamarind I can write with equal confidence.
('68', 150, 1, 15, 278376) One ounce of pulp taken with meals has in several cases induced free movement of bowels.
('68', 150, 1, 16, 278465) It can be mixed with vegetables or rice or dal.
('68', 150, 1, 17, 278513) It can be eaten as jam when mixed with sufficient quantity of gur.
('68', 150, 1, 18, 278580) I have used it with beneficial effect for reducing fevers by giving it in the form of tamarind water.
('68', 150, 1, 19, 278682) In no case have I found it to have induced cold or rheumatism or boils as many people believe it does.
('68', 150, 1, 20, 278785) There is hardly a man or woman in the South who does not eat tamarind in some shape or form.
('68', 150, 1, 21, 278878) It is the base for its famous rasam.
('68', 150, 1, 22, 278915) Village workers will have to find out cheap, effective and harmless substitutes for the expensive yet useful articles one uses in cities and which one cannot get in the villages for love or money.
('68', 150, 1, 23, 279112) Tamarind neem leaf are such substitutes.

('68', 150, 4, 26, 279194) I gladly publish Sir Govindrao Madgaonkars open letter 3 in this issue.
('68', 150, 4, 27, 279266) My own position has been often stated in these columns.
('68', 150, 4, 28, 279322) It may be summed up as follows:
('68', 150, 5, 29, 279354) 1 Jayakrishna P. Bhansali 2 Vide also Need for Care, 30 11 1935. 3 The letter appeared under the title An Open Letter to Mahatma Gandhi and Hindu Leaders.
('68', 150, 5, 30, 279509) The writer, a former judge of the Bombay High Court, had appealed to Gandhiji, Madan Mohan Malaviya and N.C. Kelkar and others to give a clear and a courageous lead in reforming the caste system.
('68', 151, 0, 1, 279705) 152 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('68', 151, 1, 2, 279747) 1. I believe in varnashrama of the Vedas which in my opinion is based on absolute equality of status, notwithstanding passages to the contrary in the smritis and elsewhere.
('68', 151, 1, 3, 279920) 2. Every word of the printed works passing muster as Shastras is not, in my opinion, a revelation.
('68', 151, 1, 4, 280019) 3. The interpretation of accepted taxts has undergone evolution, and is capable of indefinite evolution, even as the human intellect and heart are.
('68', 151, 1, 5, 280167) 4. Nothing in the Shastras which is manifestly contrary to universal truths and morals can stand.
('68', 151, 1, 6, 280265) 5. Nothing in the Shastras which is capable of being reasoned can stand if it is in conflict with reason.
('68', 151, 1, 7, 280371) 6. Varnashrama of the Shastras is today non existent in practice.
('68', 151, 1, 8, 280437) 7. The present caste system is the very antithesis of varnashrama.
('68', 151, 1, 9, 280504) The sooner public opinion abolishes it the better.
('68', 151, 1, 10, 280555) 8. In varnashrama there was and should be no prohibition of intermarriage or inter dining.
('68', 151, 1, 11, 280646) Prohibition there is of change of ones hereditary occupation for purposes of gain.
('68', 151, 1, 12, 280729) The existing practice is, therefore, doubly wrong in that it has set up cruel restrictions about inter dining and intermarriage and tolerates anarchy about choice of occupation.
('68', 151, 1, 13, 280907) 9. Thought there is in varnashrama no prohibition against intermarriage and inter dining, there can be no compulsion.
('68', 151, 1, 14, 281025) It must be left to the unfettered choice of the individuals as to where he or she will marry or dine.
('68', 151, 1, 15, 281127) If the law of varnashrama was observed there would naturally be a tendency, so far as marriage is concerned, for people to restrict the marital relations to their own varna.
('68', 151, 1, 16, 281301) 10. As I have repeatedly said there is no such thing as untouchability by birth in the Shastras.
('68', 151, 1, 17, 281398) I hold the present practice to to be a sin and the greatest blot on Hinduism.
('68', 151, 1, 18, 281476) I feel more than ever that if untouchability lives, Hinduism dies.
('68', 151, 1, 19, 281543) 11. The most effective, quickest, and the most unobtrusive way to destroy caste is for reformers to begin the practice with themselves and where necessary take the consequences of social boycott.
('68', 151, 1, 20, 281739) The reform will not come by reviling the orthodox.
('68', 151, 1, 21, 281790) The change will be gradual and imperceptible.
('68', 151, 1, 22, 281836) The so called higher classes will have to descend from their pedestal before they can make any impression upon the so called lower classed.
('68', 151, 1, 23, 281976) Day to day experience of village
('68', 152, 0, 1, 282009) VOL. 68: 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 153
('68', 152, 1, 2, 282054) work shows how difficult the task is of bridging the gulf that exists between the city dwellers and the villagers, the higher classes and the lower classes.
('68', 152, 1, 3, 282211) The two are not synonymous terms.
('68', 152, 1, 4, 282245) For the class distinction exists both in the cities and the villages.
('68', 152, 2, 5, 282315) Harijan, 16 11 1935
('68', 152, 3, 6, 282335) 187. AWFULNESS OF CHILD MARRIAGE
('68', 152, 4, 7, 282368) The Anti Child Marriage Committee has published a useful and instructive bulletin on child marriage.
('68', 152, 4, 8, 282469) I copy the main paragraphs below: 1
('68', 152, 5, 9, 282505) The Census Report for India of 1931 gave the following figures of the number of girls who are married under the age of 15 by age groups;
('68', 152, 6, 10, 282642) Age group Percentage married
('68', 152, 7, 11, 282671) 0 to 1 0.8
('68', 152, 8, 12, 282682) 1  2 1.2
('68', 152, 9, 13, 282691) 2  3 2.0
('68', 152, 10, 14, 282700) 3  4 4.2
('68', 152, 11, 15, 282709) 4  5 6.6
('68', 152, 12, 16, 282718) 5  10 19.3
('68', 152, 13, 17, 282729) 10  15 38.1
('68', 152, 14, 18, 282741) Thus nearly one girl in 100 girls of less than one year of age is married and the same horrible fact is repeated in all the other age groups under 15.
('68', 152, 15, 19, 282892) One consequence of this is the almost unbelievable number of child widows in the country.
('68', 152, 16, 20, 282982) The figures are:
('68', 152, 17, 21, 282999) Age group Actual number of widows
('68', 152, 18, 22, 283033) 0 to 1 1,515
('68', 152, 19, 23, 283046) 1  2 1,785
('68', 152, 20, 24, 283057) 2  3 3, 485
('68', 152, 21, 25, 283069) 3  4 9,076
('68', 152, 22, 26, 283080) 4  5 15,019
('68', 152, 23, 27, 283092) 5  10 1,05,482
('68', 152, 24, 28, 283107) 10  15 1,85,339
('68', 152, 25, 29, 283123) 1 Only excerpts are reproduced here.
('68', 153, 0, 1, 283160) 154 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('68', 153, 1, 2, 283202) Another consequence of child marriage is the number of young mothers who die in childbirth.
('68', 153, 1, 3, 283294) 2,00,000 deaths in child birth is the yearly average for India.
('68', 153, 1, 4, 283358) This works up to 20 deaths per hour, and a vast number of these deaths occur to girls in their teens .
('68', 153, 2, 5, 283461) Lastly, child marriage affects not merely the mother but the child and therefore the race.
('68', 153, 2, 6, 283552) In India out of every, 1,000 children born, 181 die.
('68', 153, 2, 7, 283605) This is the average; there are places in India where the average goes up to 400 per, 1,000. .
('68', 153, 3, 8, 283699) The figures should cause us all to hang our heads in shame.
('68', 153, 3, 9, 283759) But that wont remedy the evil.
('68', 153, 3, 10, 283790) The evil of child marriage is at least as extensive in the villages as in the cities.
('68', 153, 3, 11, 283876) It is pre emi nently womens work.
('68', 153, 3, 12, 283910) Men have no doubt to do their share.
('68', 153, 3, 13, 283947) But when a man turns into a beast, he is not likely to listen to reason.
('68', 153, 3, 14, 284020) It is the mothers who have to be educated to understand their privilege and duty of refusal.
('68', 153, 3, 15, 284113) Who can teach them this but women?
('68', 153, 3, 16, 284148) I venture to suggest therefore that the All India Womens Conference to be true to its name has to descend to the villages.
('68', 153, 3, 17, 284271) The bulletins are valuable.
('68', 153, 3, 18, 284299) They only reach a few of the English knowing city dwellers.
('68', 153, 3, 19, 284359) What is needed is personal touch with the village women.
('68', 153, 3, 20, 284416) Even when, if ever, it is established, the task wont be easy.
('68', 153, 3, 21, 284478) But some day or other the beginning has to be made in that direction before any result can be hoped for.
('68', 153, 3, 22, 284583) Will the All India Womens Conference make common cause with the All India Village Industries Association?
('68', 153, 3, 23, 284689) No village worker, no matter how able he or she is, need expect to approach villagers purely for the sake of social reform.
('68', 153, 3, 24, 284813) They will have to touch all spheres of village life.
('68', 153, 3, 25, 284866) Village work, I must repeat, means real education, not in the three Rs but in opening the minds of the villagers to the needs of true life befitting thinking beings which humans are supposed to be.

('68', 159, 4, 10, 292079) What is the price of it?

('68', 159, 4, 12, 292169) I understand your difficulty about the A.I.V.I.A. I quite see that you should not become an ordinary member.
('68', 159, 4, 13, 292278) I shall look up the rules and find out whether you can come in cheaply under any classification.
('68', 159, 4, 14, 292375) Probably Bharatan or Kumarappa will write to you.

('68', 159, 10, 25, 292870) I would certainly like to do it; but would it have any effect on anybody?And one likes to write something only if it is going to have some effect.
('68', 159, 10, 26, 293017) Everybody in the country is talking about the fine of Rs. 1,000. If we go on brooding over such misfortunes, we can do no work at all.
('68', 159, 10, 27, 293152) One should not grieve over what cant be helped; only then can we do something about what we can help, what is within our strength to set right.

('68', 160, 7, 8, 293634) This sort of thing is common among friends.
('68', 160, 7, 9, 293678) You must tell Sumantji, in good humour and without any anger, that you are a poor man and bring with you only enough food for yourself for the day and if you lose or part with some of it you have to go hungry that day.
('68', 160, 7, 10, 293897) I am sure if you tell him this he will never again tamper with your food.
('68', 160, 7, 11, 293971) Millions of poor people are forced to do this kind of thing.
('68', 160, 7, 12, 294032) Dishonest traders often sell for flour stuff that is quite inedible.
('68', 160, 7, 13, 294101) Poor people have then to go hungry.
('68', 160, 7, 14, 294137) For they have no money to buy provisions with.

('68', 162, 1, 3, 296006) He Said: What they need is not a knowledge of the three Rs, but a knowledge of their economic life and how they can better it.
('68', 162, 1, 4, 296133) They are today working as mere automatons, without any responsibility whatsoever to their surroundings and without feeling the joy of work.
('68', 162, 1, 5, 296273) We are entirely responsible for this sate of things, as we have had no intimate contact with them.
('68', 162, 1, 6, 296372) We have indeed studied their Politico economic condition, as did the late Romesh Chandra Dutt.
('68', 162, 1, 7, 296467) But whilst we have been told of the state to which they have been reduced, they do not know how they themselves can partly or wholly remove their poverty.
('68', 162, 1, 8, 296622) Now I think it is possible to show them how to double their income.
('68', 162, 1, 9, 296690) You will say they are heavily taxed.
('68', 162, 1, 10, 296727) That they are, but I am not cancerned with that problem at the present moment.
('68', 162, 1, 11, 296806) Our present policy is to leave all politics or politico economics alone.
('68', 162, 1, 12, 296879) You will therefore begin with a study of their social, hygienic and moral condition.
('68', 162, 1, 13, 296964) You may use magic lantern slides for the purpose.
('68', 162, 1, 14, 297014) You have to show them that untouchability is no part of religion, and that the idea of superiority of status is foreign to any true religion.
('68', 162, 1, 15, 297156) Just as a healthy man does not regard an unhealthy man as inferior to him in status, even so a teacher or a merchant may not regard a scavenger as inferior to him.
('68', 162, 1, 16, 297320) You have to teach them these fundamentals of religion and ethics.
('68', 162, 1, 17, 297386) Then you will teach them geography and historyyou will begin with the history of their own village.
('68', 162, 1, 18, 297486) Now I would teach them the three Rs as a means for imparting a knowledge of these things, but you do not need to make them matriculates or graduates for this purpose.
('68', 162, 1, 19, 297653) A knowledge of English may be a source of income in these days, but it is not necessary to add to the health of ones mind or body.
('68', 162, 1, 20, 297784) All our energy has been sapped in mastering a foreign language and in reading tons of books which in no way help us to keep ourselves physically and morally fit or to serve the villagers.
('68', 162, 1, 21, 297972) You will thus see where I bring in a knowledge of the three Rs. It comes in at the end, and at the long end at that, and not in the beginning, and then, as a help to things permanent.
('68', 162, 1, 22, 298156) You cannot more usefully pass an hour every night with them than by teaching them the laws of health, social morals, and the way of a strenuous life of easy labour.

('68', 163, 1, 2, 298383) 202. FEAR COMPLEX
('68', 163, 2, 3, 298401) Many workers are so frightened of village life that they fear that if they are not paid by some agency they will not be able to earn their living by labouring in villages, especially if they are married and have a family to support.
('68', 163, 2, 4, 298634) In my opinion this is a demoralizing belief.
('68', 163, 2, 5, 298679) No doubt, if a person goes to a village with the city mentality and wants to live in villages the city life, he will never earn enough unless he, like the city people, exploits the villagers.
('68', 163, 2, 6, 298871) But if a person settles in a village and tries to live like the villagers, he should hve no difficulty in making a living by the sweat of his brow.
('68', 163, 2, 7, 299019) He should have confidence that if the villagers who are prepared to toil all the year round in the traditional unintelligent manner can earn their living, he must also earn at least as much as the average villager.
('68', 163, 2, 8, 299234) This he will do without displacing a single villager, for he will go to village as a producer, not as a parasite.
('68', 163, 2, 9, 299348) If the worker has the ordinary size family, his wife and one other member should be full time workers.
('68', 163, 2, 10, 299451) Such a worker wont immediately have the muscle of the villager, but he will more than make up for the deficiency by his intelligence, if only he will shed his difference and fear complex.
('68', 163, 2, 11, 299639) He would be doing productive work, and not be a mere consumer, unless he gets an adequate response from the villagers so as to occupy the whole of his time in seving them.
('68', 163, 2, 12, 299811) In that case he will be worth the commission on the additional production of the villagers induced by his effort.
('68', 163, 2, 13, 299925) But the experience of the few months that the village work has gone on under the aegis of the A.I.V.I.A. shows that the response from the villagers will be very slow and that the worker will have to become a pattern of virtue and work before the villagers.
('68', 163, 2, 14, 300182) That will be the best object lesson for them which is bound to impress them sooner or later provided that he lives as one of them and not a patron seated amongst them to be adored from a respectful distance.
('68', 163, 2, 15, 300390) The question, therefore, is: what remunerative work can he do in the village of his choice?
('68', 163, 2, 16, 300482) He and the members of the family will give some time to cleaning the village, whether the villagers help him or not, and he will give them such simple medical assistance as is within his power to give.
('68', 163, 2, 17, 300684) Every person can prescribe a simple opening drug or quinine, wash a boil or wound, wash dirty eyes and ears, and apply
('68', 164, 0, 1, 300803) VOL. 68: 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 165
('68', 164, 1, 2, 300848) a clean ointment to a wound.
('68', 164, 1, 3, 300877) I am trying to find out a book that will give the simplest directions in the ordinary cases occurrring daily in the villages.
('68', 164, 1, 4, 301003) Anyway these two things must be an integral part of village work.
('68', 164, 1, 5, 301069) This ought not to occupy more than two hours of his time per day.
('68', 164, 1, 6, 301135) The village worker has no such things as an eight hours day.
('68', 164, 1, 7, 301196) For him the labour for the villager is a labour of love.
('68', 164, 1, 8, 301253) For his living, therefore, he will give eight hours at least in addition to the two hours.
('68', 164, 1, 9, 301344) It should be borne in mind that under the new scheme propounded by the A.I.S.A. and A.I.V.I.A. all labour has an equal minimum value.
('68', 164, 1, 10, 301478) Thus a carder who works at his bow for one hour and turns out the average quantity of cards will get exactly the same wage that the weaver, the spinner or the papermaker would, for the given quantity of their respective works per hour.
('68', 164, 1, 11, 301714) Therefore the worker is free to choose and learn whatever work he can easily do, care being always taken to choose such labour whoes product is easily salable in his village or the surrounding area or is in demand by the Associations.
('68', 164, 1, 12, 301949) One great need in every village in an honest shop where unadulterated food stuffs and other things can be had for the cost price and a moderate commission.
('68', 164, 1, 13, 302105) It is true that a shop, be it ever so small, requires some capital.
('68', 164, 1, 14, 302173) But a worker who is at all known in the area of his work should command sufficient confidence in his honesty to enable him to make small wholesale purchases on credit.
('68', 164, 1, 15, 302341) I may not take these concrete suggestion much further.
('68', 164, 1, 16, 302396) An observant worker will always make important discoveries and soon know what labour he can do to earn a living and be at the same time an object lesson to the villagers whom he is to serve.
('68', 164, 1, 17, 302587) He will therefore have to choose labour that will not exploit the villagers, that will not injure their health or morals but will teach the villagers to take up industries to occupy their leisure hours and add to their tiny incomes.
('68', 164, 1, 18, 302820) His observations will lead him to direct his attention to the village wastes including weeds and the superficial natural resources of the village.
('68', 164, 1, 19, 302967) He will soon find that he can turn many of them to good account.
('68', 164, 1, 20, 303032) If he picks up edible weeds, it is as good as earning part of his food.
('68', 164, 1, 21, 303104) Mirabehn has presented me with a museum of beautiful marble like stones which serve several useful purposes as they are, and I would soon convert them into bazaar articles if I has leisure and would invest into simple tools to give them different shapes.
('68', 164, 1, 22, 303359) Kaka saheb had given to me split bamboo waste that was destined to be burnt, and with a rude knife he turned some of it into paper knives
('68', 165, 0, 1, 303497) 166 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('68', 165, 1, 2, 303539) and wooden spoons both salable in limited quantities.
('68', 165, 1, 3, 303593) Some workers in Maganwadi occupy their leisure in making envelopes out of waste paper blank on one side.
('68', 165, 1, 4, 303698) The fact is the villagers have lost all hope.
('68', 165, 1, 5, 303744) They suspect that every strangers hand is at their throats and that he goes to them only to exploit them.
('68', 165, 1, 6, 303850) Divorce between intellect and labour has paralysed their thinking faculty.
('68', 165, 1, 7, 303925) Their working hours they do not use to the best advantage.
('68', 165, 1, 8, 303984) The worker should enter such villages full of love and hope, feeling sure that where men and women labour unintelligently and remain unemployed half the year round, he working all the year round and combining labour with intelligence cannot fail to win the confidence of the villagers and earn his living honestly and well by labouring in their midst.
('68', 165, 1, 9, 304336) But what about my children and their education?says the candidate worker.
('68', 165, 1, 10, 304410) If the children are to receive their education after the modern style, I can give no useful guidance.
('68', 165, 1, 11, 304512) If it be deemed enough to make them healthy, sinewy, honest, intelligent villagers, any day able to earn their livelihood in the home of their parents adoption, they will have their all around education under the parental roof and withal they will be partly earning members of the family from the moment they reach the years of understanding and are able to use their hands and feet in a methodical manner.
('68', 165, 1, 12, 304919) There is no school equal to a decent home and no teachers equal to honest virtuous parents.
('68', 165, 1, 13, 305011) Modern high school education is a dead weight on the villagers.
('68', 165, 1, 14, 305075) Their children will never be able to get it, and thank God they will never miss it if they have the training of the decent home.
('68', 165, 1, 15, 305204) If the village worker is not a decent man or woman, capable of conducting a decent home, he or she had better not aspire after the high privilege and honour of becoming a village worker.

('68', 165, 4, 18, 305438) In the death of Shri G.K. Deodhar the country has lost one of its great social workers and an uncompromising and faithful friend of Haijans.
('68', 165, 4, 19, 305579) He was one of the foundation members of the Society fonded by Gokhale.
('68', 165, 4, 20, 305650) He was President of the Maharashtra Provincial Harijan Sevak Sangh.
('68', 165, 4, 21, 305718) There was not a famine or a flood in the country which did not claim the attention of this servant of humanity.
('68', 165, 4, 22, 305830) Thought he

('68', 166, 1, 2, 305886) could easily become a rich man, he chose poverty as a life principle for a public worker.
('68', 166, 1, 3, 305976) His tireless energy was contagious.
('68', 166, 1, 4, 306012) He never spared himself when social service was demanded of him.
('68', 166, 1, 5, 306077) His was a life of spotless purity.
('68', 166, 1, 6, 306112) He was the soul of the Poona Seva Sadan which he loved and for which he laboured so well that from a little thing it has today grown into an institution of the kind second to none in all India.

('68', 167, 8, 19, 308124) There are only a handful of persons in Kathiawar who have no trace of the feeling of untouchability in their veins and are engrossed in the service of Harijans despite being orthodox.
('68', 167, 8, 20, 308308) Among them the celebrated Harijan Govindji Parekh of Amreli was a leading personality.
('68', 167, 8, 21, 308395) The late Harilal was the soul of Amreli.
('68', 167, 8, 22, 308436) There could seldom be a public welfare activity in Kathiawar in which Shri Harilal Parekh did not have a hand.
('68', 167, 8, 23, 308547) One and all needed his services and his advice, and everyone found it acceptable.
('68', 167, 8, 24, 308629) In many ways, his was an exemplary life; we should perpetuate his memory by learning all that we can from it.

('68', 168, 2, 3, 308843) WARDHA, November, 24, 1935
('68', 168, 3, 4, 308870) A sum of about Rs. 29,000 is needed for this years work of the Harijan Sevak Sangh of Gujarat.
('68', 168, 3, 5, 308965) Fifty seven schools and three ashrams are being run with the Sanghs help.
('68', 168, 3, 6, 309039) The Sangh is under the supervision of no less a public worker than Thakkar Bapa.
('68', 168, 3, 7, 309120) Shri Parikshitlal Majmudar is giving his devoted services to it.
('68', 168, 3, 8, 309185) According to me the expenditure of Rs. 29,000 a year in nothing.
('68', 168, 3, 9, 309250) If we regard the service of Harijans as our dharma and if everybody who earns Rs. 500 a year decides to spare even Re.1 this charitable activity, we can get several Lakhs of rupees annually.
('68', 168, 3, 10, 309441) But we dont yet have such religious awareness.
('68', 168, 3, 11, 309488) Moreover, not all caste Hindus regard untouchability as contrary to dharma and, therefore, accept service of the Harijan as their dharma.
('68', 168, 3, 12, 309626) Hence it doubly becomes a duty of those who regard the service of Harijans as their dharma to sustain the work of such service.
('68', 168, 3, 13, 309754) Eradication of untouchability is not one mans job.
('68', 168, 3, 14, 309805) Neither can it be done only with the help of money.
('68', 168, 3, 15, 309857) Money can be regarded as a form of energy for the work of service.
('68', 168, 3, 16, 309924) If every caste Hindu who looks upon eradication of untouchability as his dharma regularly contributes to the fund according to his capacity, then the work being done at present can be kept up and those in charge of it will be saved from financial worries.
('68', 168, 3, 17, 310180) I shall be going to Ahmedabad in the second week of January for the Gujarati Sahitya Parishad.
('68', 168, 3, 18, 310275) I am hoping to collect at that time from Gujaratis the sum mentioned above.
('68', 168, 3, 19, 310351) It was suggested to me that I should appeal for help from friends outside Gujarat [also] but I rejected the suggestion.
('68', 168, 3, 20, 310471) If I did that, it would be a disgrace to Gujarat and so to me.
('68', 168, 3, 21, 310534) No one can say that Gujarat is among the poor provinces in the country.
('68', 168, 3, 22, 310606) It has, on the contrary, helped other provinces in their time of need.
('68', 168, 3, 23, 310677) It has never begged for anything from other provinces, and rightly too.
('68', 168, 3, 24, 310749) Why shouldnt it, then, contribute for such a noble activity?
('68', 168, 3, 25, 310810) It is true that it has to contribute to many funds.
('68', 168, 3, 26, 310862) It is also true that the farmers of Gujarat have suffered many

('68', 169, 1, 2, 311059) calamities and borne great losses.
('68', 169, 1, 3, 311094) But I firmly believe that such arguments cannot be advanced as excuses for not doing ones dharma.
('68', 169, 1, 4, 311192) I, therefore, hope that all friends, men and women, will work hard and collect the small amount mentioned above and thus relieve Thakkar Bapa, other workers and me of the worry.
('68', 169, 1, 5, 311370) The burden of most of the activities in Gujarat is generally borne by Sardar.
('68', 169, 1, 6, 311448) I know that he has had to collect money for many of them.
('68', 169, 1, 7, 311506) I have, therefore, deliberately not put this burden on him.
('68', 169, 1, 8, 311566) But he cannot, for that reason, remain unconcerned till the money is collected.
('68', 169, 1, 9, 311646) Nobody should think that eradication of untouchability is Thakkar Bapas and my concern only and not his.
('68', 169, 1, 10, 311751) I hope that Gujarat will not send me back empty handed.

('68', 170, 14, 30, 313608) I am enclosing a copy of the letter 2 I have written to
('68', 170, 15, 31, 313664) 1 This silence day note is written on the back of a letter dated November 20, 1935. The Monday following November 20 fell on November 25, 1935. 2 This is not available.

('68', 171, 3, 6, 314086) WARDHA, November 27, 1935
('68', 171, 4, 7, 314112) CHANDU, I got your letter.
('68', 171, 4, 8, 314139) When I say that one per cent doubt remains, what I mean is that I am ready to listen to and think over what Father or you may say.
('68', 171, 4, 9, 314270) If I didnt have even this one per cent doubt, there would be no need at all for me to here anybody.
('68', 171, 4, 10, 314370) Please dont forget this, that before I discussed the matter with You I used to doubt the truth of what .
('68', 171, 4, 11, 314475) and his friends said.
('68', 171, 4, 12, 314497) After my long and patient talk with you, my attitude towards .
('68', 171, 4, 13, 314560) became more favourable.
('68', 171, 4, 14, 314584) Your story is something like this: you were bitten by a snake, but you did not feel the effect of poison although you already knew from experience the nature of the poison.
('68', 171, 4, 15, 314757) Just as this wouldnt be a plausible story, so is your story of [the effect of] .
('68', 171, 4, 16, 314838) .s touch not plausible.
('68', 171, 4, 17, 314862) The poison of a lustful mans touch is far more than that of a snake.
('68', 171, 4, 18, 314931) And if a snake, while lifting its young one with its teeth.
('68', 171, 4, 19, 314991) accidentally bites it with its fangs, the young one also would feel the effect of poison.
('68', 171, 4, 20, 315081) Since a child is easily influenced by its parents, if they pour poison into it the child cannot but feel its effect.
('68', 171, 4, 21, 315198) Please, therefore, know that it is your own testimony that proves the innocence of .
('68', 171, 4, 22, 315283) to the extent of 99 per cent.
('68', 171, 4, 23, 315313) And that is why I have told you, and I repeat here, that you should continue to write to me and keep me informed about everything.
('68', 171, 4, 24, 315444) If you continue to help me, the remaining one per cent doubt also can be cleared.
('68', 171, 4, 25, 315526) After your testimony, I cannot bring myself to find .
('68', 171, 4, 26, 315580) guilty.
('68', 171, 4, 27, 315588) Nor can I bring myself to believe that you are telling a brazen lie.
('68', 171, 4, 28, 315657) Till, therefore, I get further evidence, the one per cent will remain in your favour.
('68', 171, 4, 29, 315743) If you are one hundred per cent truthful and if you continue your effort [to convince me], you will be able to raise the one per cent to 100 per cent.

('68', 172, 11, 17, 316615) I have certainly asserted that birth control by artificial means is harmful and I still maintain it.
('68', 172, 11, 18, 316716) It would be wrong even to think about the possible exceptions.
('68', 172, 11, 19, 316779) The same holds true in the case of insurance, the only difference being that the number of exceptional cases can be greater in the latter case.
('68', 172, 11, 20, 316923) The spiritual harm resulting from birth control by artificial means is much greater than what results from insurance.

('68', 173, 11, 12, 317598) He wants me to explain this with illustrations.
('68', 173, 11, 13, 317646) Castes are numerous.
('68', 173, 11, 14, 317667) They are man made.
('68', 173, 11, 15, 317686) They undergo constant change.

('68', 173, 11, 18, 317823) It is only in India that there are restrictions, as regards intermarriage and inter dining, which defy reason.
('68', 173, 11, 19, 317934) This is very harmful.
('68', 173, 11, 20, 317956) It stands in the way of the communitys progress.
('68', 173, 11, 21, 318005) It has nothing to do with religion.
('68', 173, 11, 22, 318041) Varnas are just four and not numerous.
('68', 173, 11, 23, 318080) They have been sanctioned by the Shastras.

('68', 174, 1, 3, 318983) There is no feeling of high and low in this division.
('68', 174, 1, 4, 319037) But since this is not understood as a great law of nature, there has been confusion in it, that is, these four functions are no more confined to the respective varnas.
('68', 174, 1, 5, 319205) Instead men have been taking up any occupation they choose with a view to achieving their selfish ends.
('68', 174, 1, 6, 319309) At one time in India people used to consciously folllow this law and thus lived in peace.
('68', 174, 1, 7, 319399) One accepted the calling of ones own varna and was satisfied in its pursuit for general welfare.
('68', 174, 1, 8, 319496) There was no unhealthy competition among people to jump from one varna to another for the sake of money or fame.
('68', 174, 1, 9, 319609) At present this significance of the varna system seems to have disappeared even in India.
('68', 174, 1, 10, 319699) Destructive competition is on the increase, everyone takes liberty of following any profession and the meaning of varna has been restricted to unnatural and meaningless restrictions on intermarriage and inter dining.
('68', 174, 1, 11, 319916) And that is why the country has stopped progressing.
('68', 174, 1, 12, 319969) Hinduism will once again shine forth if such senseless restrictions are abolished, the pristine varna system is resurrected and the distinctions of high and low are banished.
('68', 174, 1, 13, 320144) This would be to the good of India as well as the whole world.

('68', 176, 3, 4, 322062) MIRA 2,
('68', 176, 4, 5, 322070) The bearer of your note is in a hurry to go.
('68', 176, 4, 6, 322115) Your note was read as soon as it came.
('68', 176, 4, 7, 322154) The reply is being dictated immediately after the reading.
('68', 176, 4, 8, 322213) The things wanted will be sent tomorrow with the bearer who will bring tomorrows note.
('68', 176, 4, 9, 322300) The idea of cow keeping is good.
('68', 176, 4, 10, 322333) If there is none there, I could perhaps send one from here.

('68', 176, 4, 13, 322518) Are there any goats there?
('68', 176, 4, 14, 322545) If there are, you should possess a few goats on loan.
('68', 176, 4, 15, 322599) You should take as much ghee as you need and fall back on Maganwadi for supply.
('68', 176, 4, 16, 322679) I am glad the first experience has been so happy.

('68', 176, 7, 21, 322954) For some time I was serving Bapu in Maganwadi.
('68', 176, 7, 22, 323001) Bapus health had become very bad and high blood pressure had developed.
('68', 176, 7, 23, 323073) At the same time.
('68', 176, 7, 24, 323091) Maganwadi had become overcrowded with inmates of all descriptions.
('68', 176, 7, 25, 323158) The problem of Sindi village was continuing unsolved and Bapu suddenly announced that he in tended to go and live in Sindi all alone, taking what help he required from the villagers.
('68', 176, 7, 26, 323341) Everyone was aghast at the idea, specially in view of Bapus state of health.
('68', 176, 7, 27, 323418) I asked Bapu that if I went instead to Sindi, would he accept the compromise.
('68', 176, 7, 28, 323496) Bapu reluctantly agreed.
('68', 176, 7, 29, 323521) A small one room cottage was built and I went there to live.
('68', 176, 7, 30, 323582) I felt that Sindi was no village and that our experiences of, and experiments with regard to, villages life could not really be carried on there.
('68', 176, 7, 31, 323728) I, therefore, suggested that as soon as someone else would be found ready to stay in Sindi.
('68', 176, 7, 32, 323820) I would go on to a real village in the countryside.
('68', 176, 7, 33, 323872) The following letter was addressed to me in segaon which was the village I had gone on to from Sindi. 2 The superscription in this and the other letters to the addressee is in the Devanagari script.

('68', 177, 2, 3, 324147) [Before November 30, 1935]
('68', 177, 3, 4, 324174) G.D. BIRLA: That friend in charge of the tannery 2, you say, is working for a mere pittance.
('68', 177, 3, 5, 324267) It is highly commendable.
('68', 177, 4, 6, 324293) GANDHIJI: He is a brahmin and a graduate.
('68', 177, 4, 7, 324335) He does not accept more than eight annas a day.
('68', 177, 4, 8, 324383) His wife also works else where the whole day for a bare living wage.
('68', 177, 5, 9, 324452) Yes: All that surprises me, but I do not know how long this can go on in this machine age.
('68', 177, 5, 10, 324543) I have no such fear, because I have the conviction within me that when all these achievements of the machine age will have disappeared these our handicrafts will remain; when all exploitation will have ceased, service and honest labour will remain.
('68', 177, 5, 11, 324792) It is because this faith sustains me that I am going on with my work.
('68', 177, 5, 12, 324862) After all where is there any cause for despair?
('68', 177, 5, 13, 324910) What are a few years in the vast stretch of eternity?
('68', 177, 5, 14, 324964) A study of human origins would carry us back to millions of years.
('68', 177, 5, 15, 325031) Indomitable faith in their work sustained men like Stephenson and Columbus.
('68', 177, 5, 16, 325107) Faith in my work sustains me, but there is also added to it the conviction that all the other things that seem to challenge my faith are doomed.
('68', 177, 5, 17, 325252) Dont you see that if India becomes industrialized, we shall need a Nadirshah to find out other worlds to exploit, that we shall have to pit ourselves against the naval and military power of Britain and Japan and America, of Russia and Italy?
('68', 177, 5, 18, 325494) My head reels to think of these rivalries.
('68', 177, 5, 19, 325537) No, I am clear that whilst this machine age aims at converting men into machines, I am aiming at reinstating man turned machine to his original estate.
('68', 177, 6, 20, 325689) I quite see your invincible faith.
('68', 177, 6, 21, 325724) But you seem to forget in your enthusiasm that you will not be with us until eternity.
('68', 177, 6, 22, 325811) You are getting old.
('68', 177, 6, 23, 325832) Why not make large collections and spread your work over a large area?
('68', 177, 6, 24, 325903) I do not believe in collecting more than I need.
('68', 177, 7, 25, 325952) But supposing you constructed twenty, even ten, model villages?
('68', 177, 7, 26, 326016) If it is such an easy thing, you might do so with your money.
('68', 177, 7, 27, 326078) But I know it is not easy.
('68', 177, 7, 28, 326105) You cannot bring a model village into being

('68', 178, 1, 6, 326646) Is it not the duty of the Gujaratis to find money for the Harijan work in Gujarat?
('68', 178, 1, 7, 326729) If they cannot find it, they had better close down their institutions rather than ask for outside help.

('68', 178, 3, 9, 326853) 224. AN INTERESTING POINT
('68', 178, 4, 10, 326879) The Council of the Harijan Sevak Sangh met last week at Wardha.
('68', 178, 4, 11, 326943) In view of my article Caste Has to Go 2 some members raised the question whether in the pages of Harijan which was issued under the aegis of the Harijan Sevak Sangh I was justified in airing my views on the Sangh, or whether I could express views which went beyond the official policy of the Sangh, or lastly whether the Sangh could extend the scope of its objective.
('68', 178, 4, 12, 327311) I gave it as my opinion that I was free as an individual to advocate in the pages of Harijan views which I may know to be contrary to the views of some members or maybe in advance of the official policy of the Sangh.
('68', 178, 4, 13, 327528) In my opinion, any member of the Sangh is entitled to the same freedom so long as his views do not in any way tone down the Sanghs objective.
('68', 178, 4, 14, 327670) Its policy represents the highest common factor between the views of the moderate reformer and those of the radical.
('68', 178, 4, 15, 327787) We have in the Harijan Sevak Sangh both the sections well represented.
('68', 178, 4, 16, 327858) There are sanatanists who would restrict removal of untouchability to the mere touch.
('68', 178, 4, 17, 327944) There are others who would extend it to inter dining and intermarriage.
('68', 178, 4, 18, 328016) The membership pledge lays down the minimum which every member has to subscribe to and practise in his or her own life.
('68', 178, 4, 19, 328136) It does not prevent any member from going further so long as he or she does not advocate the advanced view as the policy of the Sangh.
('68', 178, 4, 20, 328271) At its very origin all sections of Hindus had met and, in order to carry the largest number of Hindus with them, that representative gathering passed a compre

('68', 179, 0, 1, 328497) 180 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('68', 179, 1, 2, 328539) hensive resolution 1 that would secure the hearty assent of the Largest number present.
('68', 179, 1, 3, 328627) The wisdom of the course was justified in that there was, thanks to Pandit Malaviyaji, practical unanimity.
('68', 179, 1, 4, 328735) It is obvious that if the resolution had contemplated the suppression of advanced views and practice by members acting in their individual capacity many members would not have subscribed to such restriction.
('68', 179, 1, 5, 328943) But on the other hands not even a majority of the members of the board could change the constitution so far as its objective is concerned.
('68', 179, 1, 6, 329082) That can only be done by a general representative meeting of Hindus convened specially for the purpose.
('68', 179, 1, 7, 329186) Therefore whilst the most cautious refor mer may rest secure about the fundamental policy of the Sangh, the extreme radical is in no way hampered in his advocacy, as an individual, of the views which in his opinion may promote the purity and health of Hinduism.
('68', 179, 1, 8, 329448) It may be mentioned, in passing, that the views expressed by me in the article Caste Has to Go have been often expressed in these columns though under different headings.
('68', 179, 1, 9, 329619) Moreover the article does not deal with the relations between caste Hindus and Harijan Hindus.
('68', 179, 1, 10, 329714) It deals with reform only among caste men or savarnas.
('68', 179, 1, 11, 329769) When untouchability goes, untouchables will occupy precisely the same position as caste men.
('68', 179, 1, 12, 329862) And whatever rule or custom then governs caste men will govern Harijans who are no longer Harijans.
('68', 179, 1, 13, 329962) If, therefore, caste remains as it is now, there will be no intermarriage and no interdining between Harijans and caste men.
('68', 179, 1, 14, 330087) But if caste goes in its present form, as it will some day, there will most undoubtedly be intermarriage and inter dining between Harijans and caste men as there will be between caste men and caste men.
('68', 179, 1, 15, 330290) And if varna remains, as I hope it will, occupations will be restricted as they were in the past; intermarriage and inter dining will not be restricted even as they were not in the past.
('68', 179, 1, 16, 330477) Whaterver happens it will happen not because of the activity of the Sangh as a body but because of other forces which the Sangh can neither regulate nor control.
('68', 179, 1, 17, 330639) Its members as individuals will no doubt take their due share in moulding those forces according to their predilections.

('68', 180, 1, 2, 330895) 225. THE IDEAL AND THE PRACTICAL
('68', 180, 2, 3, 330928) Shri Gopabandhu Chaudhry writes: 1
('68', 180, 3, 4, 330963) In the article Need for Humane Custom 2 you refer to a calculation that self sufficing khadi will mean two yards of sale outside against three yards of wear by artisans, etc. .
('68', 180, 3, 5, 331140) But the reading of the article leaves an impression that the success of self sufficing khadi entirely depends upon the sale of khadi.
('68', 180, 3, 6, 331274) But is this a correct ideal?It not the ideal of self sufficing khadi this that in a majority of cases the spinners will spin their own cotton or purchase their cotton and pay the weaver from their earnings from other village industries or agricultural labour?
('68', 180, 4, 7, 331534) Otherwise, when our aim is to make every home in the village self sufficient, where will the extra two yards for outside sale produced by the spinners sell?Will the demand of the cities be possibly so large?
('68', 180, 5, 8, 331742) Self sufficing khadi ought to thrive independently on its own merits, as there is enough unutilized land to grow the cotton required and unemployed leisure to spin the yarn.
('68', 180, 6, 9, 331916) The ideal no boubt is for every family to grow, spin, weave and wear its own cotton, just as it it for every family to own land and grow its own corn, cook and eat it.
('68', 180, 6, 10, 332084) But we know that every family wont and cant realize the ideal; we know, too, that success will not attend the worker immediately he begins to preach the unadulterated message of self sufficing khadi.
('68', 180, 6, 11, 332284) What Gopabandhu Babu has himself suggested is itself an intermediary stage, that of a householder buying enough cotton, spinning it himself, having the yarn woven and paying the charges from his savings.
('68', 180, 6, 12, 332488) But there are million who have no savings and there are millions who purchase their cloth without performing any of the processes.
('68', 180, 6, 13, 332619) To spin for oneself and pay for cotton and weaving out of the proceeds of some other industry is an intermediate stage.
('68', 180, 6, 14, 332739) To spin extra and from the proceeds of that labour to pay for weaving is yet another intermediate stage and perhaps the easiest both from the workers and the weavers points of view.
('68', 180, 6, 15, 332921) In working out this stage we have ready made khadi centres.
('68', 180, 6, 16, 332981) There the workers have to induce spinners and other artisans to wear khadi if

('68', 181, 1, 2, 333196) they are to continue to get work through the All India Spinners Association agency.
('68', 181, 1, 3, 333280) There are many among them who depend for their maintenance entirely on their labour spent on spinning, weaving, carding or dyeing.
('68', 181, 1, 4, 333411) These can only wear khadi if they work at producing surplus khadi and command the sale of such products.
('68', 181, 1, 5, 333516) This ought not to be difficult, if in spite of the rise in the spinners wage the existing demand for khadi continues.
('68', 181, 1, 6, 333634) In practice all the stages will be worked simultaneously.
('68', 181, 1, 7, 333692) What the new scheme does is to put the emphasis on the right spot and state what the goal is in unmistakable terms.
('68', 181, 1, 8, 333808) Khadi workers will no longer concentrate on increasing sales and reducing the price of khadi.
('68', 181, 1, 9, 333902) They are henceforth to concentrate on people becoming self sufficing about their cloth requirements at least to the extent of spinning.
('68', 181, 1, 10, 334038) They will have to establish personal touch with the artisans, befriend them, know their wants and help them, progressively to improve their economic condition by making the best possible use of their leisure hours consistently with equal opportunity for all.
('68', 181, 1, 11, 334297) This ought to be a good enough programme for the most ambitious worker.
('68', 181, 1, 12, 334369) The most difficult task will be on the one hand to open the eyes of understanding of the millions and persuade them to use their leisure hours for their own betterment and on the other to persuade the buying classthe city people and the middle mento realize that in the long run it pays them if they buy village manufactures even though their cost may be apparently some what higher than they have hitherto paid and even though the appearance be not quite what they have been used to.
('68', 181, 1, 13, 334854) It pays them because it raises the material condition of the people and therefore their purchasing power.
('68', 181, 1, 14, 334960) The new scheme is therefore calculated to draw the best out of the whole of the nation irrespective of caste, colour or creed.
('68', 181, 1, 15, 335087) The question ultimately resolves itself into this: Have we for this task workers enough of the requisite purity, self sacrifice, industry and intelligence?

('68', 182, 2, 3, 335327) A correspondent who has for years been wearing khadi made out of his own yarn writes:
('68', 182, 3, 4, 335413) This year I had 80 yards of khadi of 50 inches width.
('68', 182, 3, 5, 335467) It cost me twenty
('68', 182, 4, 6, 335485) rupees in round figures.
('68', 182, 4, 7, 335510) People want my khadi at 10 as.
('68', 182, 4, 8, 335541) per yard.
('68', 182, 4, 9, 335551) i.e., Rs. 50
('68', 182, 5, 10, 335564) for the whole piece.
('68', 182, 5, 11, 335585) Thus if I want to use three yards for myself I need to sell only 11 2 yards.
('68', 182, 5, 12, 335662) If I keep for myself 20 yards and sell the rest, besides paying for
('68', 182, 6, 13, 335730) my own khadi, I would make a profit of Rs. 17/8. I know this correspondent.
('68', 182, 6, 14, 335806) He stands in an exceptionally favourable position becuase his yarn is a fine, even and strong.
('68', 182, 6, 15, 335901) Weavers weave it at reasonable rates, and the khadi being therefore strong and fine looking is greatly in demand.
('68', 182, 6, 16, 336015) Everyone having faith and patiene may verify the truth of the statement by making the experiment himself.
('68', 182, 6, 17, 336121) Strong, even and fine yarn is the secret of successful khadi.

('68', 182, 8, 19, 336203) 227. NEED FOR CARE
('68', 182, 9, 20, 336222) Apropos of my reproduction of Dr. Aykroyds letter 1 on neem leaves and tamarind, the reader will appreciate the following further letter 2 from the Director of Nutrition Research.
('68', 182, 10, 21, 336402) 1. I think there is a certain danger in publishing small items of dietetic knowledge apart, as it were, from their scientific context.
('68', 182, 10, 22, 336537) Ignorant readers are apt to make faulty interpretations.
('68', 182, 10, 23, 336594) For example, on rereading the paragraph in my letter of Novermber 6 relating to neem leaves, which you wish to publish in your paper, I think it might possibly give the impression that everyone should consume great quantities of this vegetable as a cure for all human ills.
('68', 182, 10, 24, 336868) Actually, the small series of analyses we have carried out to date show neem leaves to be somewhat richer in certain food factors than a number of other leafy vegetables, but it is only a question of degree.
('68', 182, 10, 25, 337076) In a word, it would be better, for purposes of popular education, to stress the value of all green leafy vegetables rather than to single out one particular vegetable for special

('68', 183, 1, 2, 337390) commendation.
('68', 183, 1, 3, 337404) I should therefore prefer the paragraph, which refers to the bitter variety of neem leaves (Azadirachta Indica) to read as follows:
('68', 183, 2, 4, 337536) QUEESTION: What is the nutritive value of neem leaves?
('68', 183, 3, 5, 337591) ANSWER: Neem leaves resemble other green leafy vegetables in com position.
('68', 183, 3, 6, 337666) Both mature and tender leaves are richer in protein, calcium, iron and carotene than amaranth leaves, coriander leaves, drumstick leaves, lettuce, marraya leaves and spinach.
('68', 183, 3, 7, 337841) Their composition makes them valuable as a supplement to a diet largely composed of cereals, and in this respect they resemble the leafy vegetables in general.
('68', 183, 4, 8, 338001) 2. The paragraph relating to tamarind and lemon might be modified as follows:
('68', 183, 5, 9, 338079) With regard to vitamin content, tamarind and lemon are roughly similar, except that the latter is richer in the antiscorbutic vitamin C. Tamarind pulp, unlike lemon, contains a good deal of tartaric acidabout 14%; the chief acid in lemon is citric acid.
('68', 183, 5, 10, 338333) Fresh tamarind, which is more solid than fresh lemon, contains a somewhat higher percentage of protein, corbohydrate and minerals than lemon; in the dried state tamarind yields about 3% protein and 73% carbohydrate (by difference).
('68', 183, 5, 11, 338565) Tamarind is stated to contain a laxative principle.
('68', 183, 5, 12, 338617) I can offer nothing in support of the popular belief that it induces fever and rheumatism .

('68', 186, 14, 18, 342608) I got your letter.
('68', 186, 14, 19, 342627) I am getting confirmed in the views which I have publicly expressed.
('68', 186, 14, 20, 342696) Your argument 2 applies to all similar things, but just as it would not be right to carry on public propaganda for such things so also it would not be right to do so in this case.
('68', 186, 14, 21, 342876) One may propagate a thing that is spiritually elevating.
('68', 186, 14, 22, 342933) How can one propagate something that has a lowering tendency?
('68', 186, 14, 23, 342995) A lowering tendency need not be taken in a deprecatory sense here.
('68', 186, 14, 24, 343062) Everybody would welcome sex gratification without having to have children.
('68', 186, 14, 25, 343137) Therefore the means of ensuring this are spreading like intoxicants.
('68', 186, 14, 26, 343206) If there is any cause for regret, it is only that what is morally bad is being regarded as morally desirable.

('68', 187, 7, 11, 343984) I have seen both your letters and you must have got the wire I sent you this morning.
('68', 187, 7, 12, 344070) In my opinion no harm can come out of seeing Satyavati.
('68', 187, 7, 13, 344126) After all, your aim is justice.
('68', 187, 7, 14, 344158) But she should hold an authority from the workers.
('68', 187, 7, 15, 344209) The best thing would be to take all the complaints to an agreed arbitrator with the initial condition that there should be no future strike.
('68', 187, 7, 16, 344350) I have not suggested my own name, for how can I even take up this function?

('68', 187, 13, 24, 344659) I had your previous letter.
('68', 187, 13, 25, 344687) It did not particularly call for a reply, hence I saved my time for some other work.
('68', 187, 13, 26, 344772) Now I shall not treat your letter of the 29th ultimo in the same manner.
('68', 187, 13, 27, 344845) Do continue to post me with your bitter sweet experiences.

('68', 187, 14, 29, 344970) 1 The letter carries the following note by Mahadev Desai: A Hindustan Times issues reports Satyavati as the wife of dismissed employee.
('68', 187, 14, 30, 345106) It hurt Bapu.
('68', 187, 14, 31, 345120) He wrote to Satyavati who had complained to him that it was a stupid blunder by a reporter and that even Ghanshyamdas would not like it.

('68', 188, 1, 2, 345303) comprehensive.
('68', 188, 1, 3, 345318) I fail to see a reflection of my own experiences in the picture that I form in my mind by putting together Mahaev's description of the experiences at Sindi.
('68', 188, 1, 4, 345475) There is a restraint in Mahadev's description, hence the bitter experiences included in it are like sugar refined in a factory.
('68', 188, 1, 5, 345603) I can summarize my experience of Sindi in one sentence.
('68', 188, 1, 6, 345659) Justice has not yet been done to Sindi.
('68', 188, 1, 7, 345699) But willy nilly I happen to be its director.
('68', 188, 1, 8, 345744) And what sort of a director?
('68', 188, 1, 9, 345773) I used to pay only short visits.
('68', 188, 1, 10, 345806) Now I visit the place daily and stay there for a few minutes.
('68', 188, 1, 11, 345868) I have not mixed with the people.
('68', 188, 1, 12, 345902) Mirabehn tried hard to do it.
('68', 188, 1, 13, 345932) But she had gone there only to stop me from settling down in the place.
('68', 188, 1, 14, 346004) 1 She had not set her mind on it.
('68', 188, 1, 15, 346038) She was staying under my pressure.
('68', 188, 1, 16, 346073) Now Gajanan 2 is there but it is also only an experiment.
('68', 188, 1, 17, 346131) Hence it is likely you are mistaken in placing Sindi in line with the others.
('68', 188, 1, 18, 346209) I can say that for me [the work at] Sindi is vast enough.
('68', 188, 1, 19, 346267) We have done nothing about.
('68', 188, 1, 20, 346295) A separate ashram has come into being at Nalawadi.
('68', 188, 1, 21, 346346) it cannot be said that it has any appreciable impact on the people of Nalawadi.
('68', 188, 1, 22, 346426) It is a different kind of activity.
('68', 188, 1, 23, 346462) We have not yet mastered the art of living in a village.
('68', 188, 1, 24, 346519) We still have to learn the way of mingling with them.
('68', 188, 1, 25, 346573) Hence Nalawadi, Vadaj and Sindi, and all the three are different things.
('68', 188, 1, 26, 346646) Your experiment is the fourth and it is in line with the experiments that are now being carried on.
('68', 188, 1, 27, 346746) Let us see what finally comes out of it.
('68', 188, 1, 28, 346787) I am therefore closely watching your work.
('68', 188, 1, 29, 346830) I am intentionally forgoing the temptation of taking more work from you.
('68', 188, 1, 30, 346903) I had to exercise great firmness in sending my reply to Navli .

('68', 189, 5, 8, 347696) [December 3/4, 1935] 2
('68', 189, 6, 9, 347719) Gandhiji poured his whole being into his conversation.
('68', 189, 6, 10, 347774) He revealed himself inside out, giving Mrs. Sanger an intimate glimpse of his own private life.
('68', 189, 6, 11, 347870) He also declared to her his own limitations, especially the stupendous limitation of his own philosophy of lifea philosophy that seeks self realization through self control, and said that from him there could be one solution and one alone:
('68', 189, 7, 12, 348110) [G.] I could not recommend the remedy of birth control to a woman who wanted my approval.
('68', 189, 7, 13, 348200) I should simply say to her: My remedy is of no use to you.
('68', 189, 7, 14, 348259) You must go to others for advice.
('68', 189, 8, 15, 348293) Mrs. Sanger cited some hard cases.
('68', 189, 8, 16, 348328) Gandhiji said: I agree, there are hard cases.
('68', 189, 8, 17, 348374) Else birth control enthusiasts would have no case.
('68', 189, 8, 18, 348425) But I would say, do devise remedies by all means, but the remedies should be other than the ones you advise.
('68', 189, 8, 19, 348534) If you and I as moral reformers put our foot down on this remedy and said, You must fall back on other remedies, those would surely be found.
('68', 189, 9, 20, 348676) Both seemed to be agreed that woman should be emancipated, that woman should be the arbiter of her destiny.
('68', 189, 9, 21, 348784) But Mrs. Sanger would have Gandhiji work for woman's emancipation through her pet device, just as believers in violence want Gandhiji to win India's freedom through violence, since they seem to be sure that non violence can never succeed.
('68', 189, 10, 22, 349023) She forgets this fundamental difference in her impatience to prove that Gandhiji does not know the women of India.
('68', 189, 10, 23, 349138) And she claims to prove this on the ground that he makes an impossible appeal to the women of Indiathe appeal to resist their husbands.
('68', 189, 10, 24, 349274) Well, this is what he said:
('68', 189, 11, 25, 349302) 1 Reproduced from Mahadev Desai's article Mrs. Sanger and Birthcontrol 2 According to Gandhi1915 1948: A Detailed Chronology, Margaret Sanger met Gandhiji on December 3 and 4.
('68', 190, 0, 1, 349478) VOL. 68 : 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 191
('68', 190, 1, 2, 349524) My wife I made the orbit of all women.
('68', 190, 1, 3, 349563) In her I studied all women.
('68', 190, 1, 4, 349591) I came in contact with many European women in South Africa, and I knew practically every Indian woman there.
('68', 190, 1, 5, 349700) I worked with them.
('68', 190, 1, 6, 349720) I tried to show them they were not slaves either to their husbands or parents, not only in the political field but in the domestic as well.
('68', 190, 1, 7, 349860) But the trouble was that some could not resist their husbands.
('68', 190, 1, 8, 349923) The remedy is in the hands of women themselves.
('68', 190, 1, 9, 349971) The struggle is difficult for them, and I do not blame them.
('68', 190, 1, 10, 350032) I blame the men.
('68', 190, 1, 11, 350049) Men have legislated against them.
('68', 190, 1, 12, 350083) Man has regarded woman as his tool.
('68', 190, 1, 13, 350119) She has learned to be his tool and in the end found it easy and pleasurable to be such, because when one drags another in his fall the descent is easy .
('68', 190, 1, 14, 350272) 1 I have felt that during the years still left to me if I can drive home to women's minds the truth that they are free, we will have no birth control problem in India.
('68', 190, 1, 15, 350440) If they will only learn to say no to their husbands when they approach them carnally!
('68', 190, 1, 16, 350526) I do not suppose all husbands are brutes and if women only know how to resist them, all will be well.
('68', 190, 1, 17, 350628) I have been able to teach women who have come in contact with me how to resist their husbands.
('68', 190, 1, 18, 350723) The real problem is that many do not want to resist them.
('68', 190, 1, 19, 350781) No resistance bordering upon bitterness will be necessary in 99 out of 100 cases.
('68', 190, 1, 20, 350863) If a wife says to her husband, No, I do not want it, he will make no trouble.
('68', 190, 1, 21, 350941) But she hasn't been taught.
('68', 190, 1, 22, 350969) Her parents in most cases won't teach it to her.
('68', 190, 1, 23, 351018) There are some cases, I know, in which parents have appealed to their daughters' husbands not to force motherhood on their daughters.
('68', 190, 1, 24, 351152) And I have come across amenable husbands too.
('68', 190, 1, 25, 351198) I want woman to learn the primary right of resistance.
('68', 190, 1, 26, 351253) She thinks now that she has not got it .
('68', 190, 2, 27, 351294) Mrs. Sanger raises the phantasmagoria of irritations, disputes, and thwarted longings that Gandhiji's advice would bring into the home. .
('68', 190, 2, 28, 351432) She cited cases of great nervous and mental breakdowns as a result of the practice of self control.
('68', 190, 2, 29, 351532) Gandhiji spoke from a knowledge of the numerous letters he receives every mail, when he said to her: The evidence is all based on examination of imbeciles.
('68', 190, 2, 30, 351688) The conclusions are not drawn from the practice of healthy minded people.
('68', 190, 2, 31, 351762) The people they take for examples have not lived a life of even tolerable continence.
('68', 190, 2, 32, 351848) These neurologists assume that people are expected to exercise self restraint while they continue to lead the same ill regulated life.
('68', 190, 2, 33, 351983) The consequence is that they do not exercise self restraint but become lunatics.
('68', 190, 2, 34, 352064) I carry on correspondence with many of
('68', 190, 3, 35, 352103) 1 Omissions as in the source
('68', 191, 0, 1, 352132) 192 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('68', 191, 1, 2, 352174) these people and they describe their own ailments to me.
('68', 191, 1, 3, 352231) I simply say that if I were to present them with this method of birth control they would lead far worse lives.
('68', 191, 2, 4, 352342) He told her that when she went to Calcutta she would be told by those who knew what havoc contraceptives had worked among unmarried young men and women.
('68', 191, 2, 5, 352495) But evidently for the purpose of the conversation, at any rate, Mrs. Sanger confined herself to propagation of knowledge of birthcontrol among married couples only .
('68', 191, 2, 6, 352661) The distinction that Gandhiji drew between love and lust will be evident from the following excerpts from the conversation:
('68', 191, 3, 7, 352785) When both want to satisfy animal passion without having to suffer the consequences of their act it is not love, it is lust.
('68', 191, 3, 8, 352909) But if love is pure, it will transcend animal passion and will regulate itself.
('68', 191, 3, 9, 352989) We have not had enough education of the passions.
('68', 191, 3, 10, 353039) When a husband says, Let us not have children, but let us have relations, what is that but animal passion?
('68', 191, 3, 11, 353146) If they do not want to have more children they should simply refuse to unite.
('68', 191, 3, 12, 353224) Love becomes lust the moment you make it a means for the satisfaction of animal needs.
('68', 191, 3, 13, 353311) It is just the same with food.
('68', 191, 3, 14, 353342) If food is taken only for pleasure it is lust.
('68', 191, 3, 15, 353389) You do not take chocolates for the sake of satisfying your hunger.
('68', 191, 3, 16, 353456) You take them for pleasure and then ask the doctor for an antidote.
('68', 191, 3, 17, 353524) Perhaps you tell the doctor that whisky befogs your brain and he gives you an antidote.
('68', 191, 3, 18, 353612) Would it not be better not to take chocolates or whisky?
('68', 191, 4, 19, 353669) S. No I do not accept the analogy.
('68', 191, 5, 20, 353704) G. Of course you will not accept the analogy because you think this sex expression without desire for children is a need of the soul, a contention I do not endorse.
('68', 191, 6, 21, 353869) S. Yes, sex expression is a spiritual need and I claim that the quality of this expression is more important than the result, for the quality of the relationship is there regardless of results.
('68', 191, 6, 22, 354063) We all know that the great majority of children are born as an accident, without the parents having any desire for conception.
('68', 191, 6, 23, 354190) seldom are two people drawn together in the sex act by their desire to have children.
('68', 191, 6, 24, 354276) Do you think it possible for two people who are in love, who are happy together, to regulate their sex act only once in two years, so that relationship would only take place when they wanted a child?
('68', 191, 6, 25, 354476) Do you think is possible?
('68', 191, 7, 26, 354502) G. I had the honour of doing that very thing and I am not the only one.
('68', 191, 8, 27, 354574) Mrs. Sanger thought it was illogical to contend that sex union for the purpose of having children would be love and union for the satisfaction of the sexual appetite
('68', 192, 0, 1, 354740) VOL. 68 : 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 193
('68', 192, 1, 2, 354786) was lust, for the same act was involved in both.
('68', 192, 1, 3, 354835) Gandhiji immediately capitulated and said he was ready to describe all sexual union as partaking of the nature of lust.
('68', 192, 1, 4, 354955) I know, from my own experience that as long as I looked upon my wife carnally, we had no real understanding.
('68', 192, 1, 5, 355064) Our love did not reach a high plane.
('68', 192, 1, 6, 355101) There was affection between us always, but we came closer and closer the more we or rather I became restrained.
('68', 192, 1, 7, 355213) There never was want of restraint on the part of my wife.
('68', 192, 1, 8, 355271) Very often she would show restraint, but she rarely resisted me although she showed disinclination very often.
('68', 192, 1, 9, 355382) All the time I wanted carnal pleasure I could not serve her.
('68', 192, 1, 10, 355443) The moment I bade good bye to a life of carnal pleasure our whole relationship became spiritual.
('68', 192, 1, 11, 355540) Lust died and love reigned instead.
('68', 192, 2, 12, 355576) Mrs. Sanger is so impatient to prove that Gandhiji is a visionary that she forgets the practical ways and means that Gandhiji suggested to her.
('68', 192, 2, 13, 355720) she asked:
('68', 192, 3, 14, 355731) Must the sexual union take place only three or four times in an entire lifetime?
('68', 192, 4, 15, 355812) G. Why should people not be taught that it is immoral to have more than three or four children and that after they have had that number they should sleep separately?
('68', 192, 4, 16, 355978) If they are taught this it would harden into custom.
('68', 192, 4, 17, 356031) And if social reformers cannot impress this idea upon the people, why not a law?
('68', 192, 4, 18, 356112) If husband and wife have four children, they would have had sufficient animal enjoyment.
('68', 192, 4, 19, 356201) Their love may then be lifted to a higher plane.
('68', 192, 4, 20, 356250) Their bodies have met.
('68', 192, 4, 21, 356273) After they have had the children they wanted, their love transforms itself into a spiritual relationship.
('68', 192, 4, 22, 356379) If these children die and they want more, then they may meet again.
('68', 192, 4, 23, 356447) Why must people be slaves of this passion when they are not of others?
('68', 192, 4, 24, 356518) When you give them education in birth control,you tell them it is a duty.
('68', 192, 4, 25, 356592) You say to them that if they do not do this thing they will interrupt their spiritual evolution.
('68', 192, 4, 26, 356689) You do not even talk of regulation.
('68', 192, 4, 27, 356725) After giving them education in birth control, you do not say to them, thus far and no further.
('68', 192, 4, 28, 356820) You ask people to drink temperately, as though it was possible to remain temperate.
('68', 192, 4, 29, 356904) I know these temperate people .
('68', 192, 5, 30, 356936) And yet as Mrs. Sanger was so dreadfully in earnest Gandhiji did mention a remedy which could conceivably appeal to him.
('68', 192, 5, 31, 357057) That method was the avoidance of sexual union during unsafe periods confining it to the safe period of about ten days during the month.
('68', 192, 5, 32, 357193) That had at least an element of self control which had to exercised during the unsafe period.
('68', 192, 5, 33, 357287) Whether this appealed to Mrs. Sanger or not I do not know.
('68', 192, 5, 34, 357346) But therein spoke Gandhiji the truth seeker.
('68', 192, 5, 35, 357391) Mrs. Sanger has not referred to it anywhere in her interviews or her Illustrated Weekly article.
('68', 192, 5, 36, 357488) Perhaps if birth

('68', 194, 9, 21, 359805) It was very good indeed that you wrote your letter calmly.
('68', 194, 9, 22, 359864) Do continue to write in detail so that Father needn't write.
('68', 194, 9, 23, 359925) It is extremely difficult to explain fully why I didn't believe your story.
('68', 194, 9, 24, 360001) 2 The analogy you have adduced is not correct.
('68', 194, 9, 25, 360048) You yourself admit that the incident Which took place couldnot happen without impure desire.
('68', 194, 9, 26, 360141) And when it took place you had already had experience of such desire.
('68', 194, 9, 27, 360211) And still you say that even in impure actions you did not recognize any impure desire in .
('68', 194, 9, 28, 360302) ., nor was such desire aroused in you by those actions.
('68', 194, 9, 29, 360358) This part of the story is not plausible and so I disregard the rest of it also.
('68', 194, 9, 30, 360438) If I accept your account, I would have to draw a terrible inference against you, namely, that impure desire was aroused in you but that you now shrink from admitting the fact.
('68', 194, 9, 31, 360614) How can I bring myself to draw such an inference?
('68', 194, 9, 32, 360664) I, therefore, believe that there is conscious or unconscious exaggeration in your account.
('68', 194, 9, 33, 360755) And since I believe that, the conundrums you have put to me have little meaning.

('68', 196, 1, 7, 362635) My advice to you is that, in your own case, you may do what you like but should take no interest in the propaganda move.

('68', 196, 9, 28, 363663) Personally I approve of it.
('68', 196, 9, 29, 363691) I never like the employees in a big department taking loans from its funds.
('68', 196, 9, 30, 363767) I can, however, imagine the necessity of permitting them to borrow with the Head's permission.
('68', 196, 9, 31, 363862) It would be less undesirable if employees got loans openly from a public organization instead of incurring private debts.

('68', 198, 3, 4, 365443) BHAI GIRIJAPRASAD: SIR CHINUBHAI MADHAVLAL,
('68', 198, 4, 5, 365487) It is against my nature to announce beforehand what I intend to do.
('68', 198, 4, 6, 365555) Doing So makes me feel ashamed.
('68', 198, 4, 7, 365587) Quite often, an impression has got around of my having done something only after having announced my intention of doing it.
('68', 198, 4, 8, 365711) Your letter raises such a question.
('68', 198, 4, 9, 365747) I really consider myself disqualified for the Sahitya Parishad.
('68', 198, 4, 10, 365811) But I was forgetting that you brothers and sisters want to use me to keep the Parishad free from feuds.
('68', 198, 4, 11, 365915) Doubtless I can be useful in that way and I am accepting your invitation in the hope that I may be instrumental in doing something in that direction.
('68', 198, 4, 12, 366065) Keep my burden as light as possible.
('68', 198, 4, 13, 366102) It is a matter of consolation to me that you are the Chairman of the Reception Committee.
('68', 198, 4, 14, 366192) I take it for granted that the Parishad would not be meeting at least this year.
('68', 198, 4, 15, 366273) If it is scheduled to meet some time in January or after that, there will be no inconvenience.
('68', 198, 4, 16, 366368) But it will suit me if it is scheduled for as early as possible in the new year.

('68', 199, 2, 3, 367136) [Before December 7, 1935]
('68', 199, 3, 4, 367162) [VILLAGE WORKER:] Why are we laying such an emphasis on khadi and wholesome food stuffs, when you know that even before the advent of the British, khadi was there and our good food stuffs were there, and yet we were in no better case?
('68', 199, 3, 5, 367397) [GANDHIJI:] This question was discussed threadbare in the columms of Young India and Navajivan if you read them.
('68', 199, 3, 6, 367510) But I shall sum up the reply for you.
('68', 199, 3, 7, 367548) We had khadi, but we did not know its significance; we were self contained, but without realizing its nec essity.
('68', 199, 3, 8, 367662) There was little intelligence behind khadi and our handicrafts, and we little realized that they sustained us.
('68', 199, 3, 9, 367773) Therefore, when they were lost to us we did not miss them, and today when an attempt is being made to restore them, some of us are wondering what use there could be in their restoration.
('68', 199, 4, 10, 367960) Then that means that political education and propaganda is needed, and you have tabooed this.
('68', 199, 4, 11, 368054) No political propaganda is needed to teach people the lesson of self help, of reform in their diet, and of throwing off their inertia and making the best of their idle hours.
('68', 199, 5, 12, 368229) My difficulty is this, that though people in our villages are working like asses from morning until night without an hour's respite they do not get enough to eat.
('68', 199, 5, 13, 368392) And you are asking them to labour still more?
('68', 199, 5, 14, 368438) What you say is news to me.
('68', 199, 5, 15, 368466) The villages I know are those in which quantities of time are being wasted.
('68', 199, 5, 16, 368542) But if as you say there are people who are being overworked, I am asking such people to accept nothing less than a living wage for nothing more than eight hours' work.
('68', 199, 6, 17, 368710) But why not accept the machine with all its good points, eliminating the bad ones?
('68', 199, 6, 18, 368793) I cannot afford to keep our human machines idle.
('68', 199, 6, 19, 368842) We have such an amount of human power lying idle that we have no room for other power driven machines.
('68', 199, 7, 20, 368945) Introduce the power driven machines and get them to work for only as long as is needed for our purposes.
('68', 199, 7, 21, 369050) How do you mean?
('68', 199, 7, 22, 369067) Supposing X produced all the cloth we needed, in mills specially constructed for the purpose, and gave work

('68', 200, 1, 2, 369268) to say three million men, also distributing all the profit between them, what then?
('68', 200, 1, 3, 369352) Then these three million men will be having all the money that used to be distributed between 300 million a hundred years ago.
('68', 200, 2, 4, 369479) No, Sir, I propose that our men should not work more than is necessary for our purposes.
('68', 200, 2, 5, 369568) same work is indeed necessary for all of us, but why should we work, say, more than a couple of hours a day and not devote the rest of our time to pleasant occupations?
('68', 200, 2, 6, 369737) So you would be satisfied if our men were to work only for one hour a day?
('68', 200, 3, 7, 369812) That should be worked out.
('68', 200, 3, 8, 369839) But I should certainly be satisfied.
('68', 200, 3, 9, 369876) Well there's the rub.
('68', 200, 3, 10, 369898) I should never be satisfied until all men had plenty of productive work, say, eight hours a day.
('68', 200, 4, 11, 369995) But why, I wonder, should you insist on this eight hours' minimum?
('68', 200, 4, 12, 370062) Because I know that millions will not employ themselves in work for the sake of it.
('68', 200, 4, 13, 370146) If they did not need to work for their bread, they would lack the incentive.
('68', 200, 4, 14, 370223) Supposing a few millionaires from America came and offered to send us all our food stuffs and implored us not to work but to permit them to give vent to their philanthropy, I should refuse point blank to accept their kind offer.
('68', 200, 5, 15, 370452) That would be because the offer would hurt your self respect?
('68', 200, 5, 16, 370514) No, not only because of that; but especially because it strikes at the root of the fundamental law of our being, viz., that we must work for our bread, that we eat our bread by the sweat of our brow.
('68', 200, 6, 17, 370714) But that is your personal view.
('68', 200, 6, 18, 370746) Would you leave the organization of society to society itself, or would you leave it to a few good guides?
('68', 200, 6, 19, 370853) I should leave it to a few good guides.
('68', 200, 7, 20, 370893) Which means that you are for a dictatorship.
('68', 200, 7, 21, 370938) No, for the simple reason that my fundamental principle is non violence and I should not coerce any individual or community.
('68', 200, 7, 22, 371063) Guidance is not dictatorship.

('68', 200, 9, 24, 371112) 251. EVIL OF CREDIT SALES
('68', 200, 10, 25, 371138) Whilst the whole policy of the A.I.S.A. about khadi is being overhauled, it is well to remind those who are in charge of the numerous khadi depots that the custom of selling khadi on credit has on the whole resulted in loss rather than gain to khadi.
('68', 200, 10, 26, 371389) The temptation to give credit to friends, acquaintances and monied men is no doubt very great.
('68', 200, 10, 27, 371484) Often it offends them if credit is refused when, they
('68', 201, 0, 1, 371538) 202 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('68', 201, 1, 2, 371580) contend, no risk is to be run.
('68', 201, 1, 3, 371611) These good people do not realize that it is wrong to expect a salesman to make invidious distinctions.
('68', 201, 1, 4, 371714) Numerous complaints are received from managers of khadi depots about friends and well to do men not discharging the debts incurred by them.
('68', 201, 1, 5, 371854) To issue processes of law for the recovery of debts is a thankless and expensive task and often means more worry than it is worth.
('68', 201, 1, 6, 371985) Hence even at the risk of offending and even losing some customers the safe course is never to depart from the golden rule of no credit sales.
('68', 201, 1, 7, 372128) Let the khadi workers realize that the mission of khadi is not to be confined to the cities, it has to spread among the millions of villagers who are waiting to hear the call.
('68', 201, 1, 8, 372304) We do not know how to reach them.
('68', 201, 1, 9, 372338) We have hitherto tried the roundabout way.
('68', 201, 1, 10, 372381) We shall not find the direct and the true way in the vain attempt to show ever increasing sales in the books of city depots.
('68', 201, 1, 11, 372506) Let them know that it is the surplus khadi that is to find its way to cities.
('68', 201, 1, 12, 372584) The vast quantity has to be made and used by the villagers themselves.
('68', 201, 1, 13, 372655) The true way to reach the villagers is to concentrate on them in their own cottages.
('68', 201, 1, 14, 372740) City sales, therefore, car be no index of the progress of the mission of khadi.
('68', 201, 1, 15, 372820) Khadi statistics of the future have to show the progress made from year to year in the villages.
('68', 201, 1, 16, 372917) If a large number of workers are to be freed for the spread of khadi in the villages, we must reduce our labours in the cities.
('68', 201, 1, 17, 373045) One way of doing it is religiously to do away with credit sales and confine our attention to those who really want khadi and appreciate the virtue of cash payment.
('68', 201, 1, 18, 373209) Credit sales invariably mean increase in prices for they involve more work, i.e., more expenses.
('68', 201, 1, 19, 373306) Considered from all points of view credit sales have nothing to recommend them except the doubtful convenience of a few customers.
('68', 201, 1, 20, 373437) But khadi exists not for the convenience of the few.
('68', 201, 1, 21, 373490) It is intended for the benefit of all.
('68', 201, 1, 22, 373529) In restricting khadi sales, therefore, to cash transactions the A. I. S. A. seeks the welfare not only of the hungry millions but also of the city buyers of khadi.

('68', 202, 10, 25, 375159) In his letter dated December 13 to Jawaharlal Nehru, Mahadev Desai wrote: He [Gandhiji] has been having high blood pressure for several months, I think, and we should not have noticed it but for a timely warning ten days ago when he had some unaccountable pain in the back regions of the headno headache, no neuralgic or rheumatic pain, but a certain pain accompanied by numbness which disappeared with careful massage but recurred every two or three hours.
('68', 202, 10, 26, 375617) It was only when the doctors were calledI wired to Jivarajthat it was found that he had a blood pressure over 200 (syst.) and 120 (diast.).
('68', 202, 10, 27, 375757) He has since been having perfect rest in bed, attending to no correspondence, writing nothing, dictating nothing.

('68', 203, 3, 4, 375982) I have been wanting to write to you and then forgetting.
('68', 203, 3, 5, 376039) As far as I can see sitting here, I think I shall be staying at the Vidyapith when I visit Ahmedabad, l certainly would have liked to stay with you, but in view of your health and my engagements there I think it will be preferable for me to stay at the Vidyapith.

('68', 205, 2, 3, 378956) WARDHA, December 19, 1935
('68', 205, 3, 4, 378982) MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL,
('68', 205, 4, 5, 379002) I wrote to you last week about the sudden breakdown in Bapu's health.
('68', 205, 4, 6, 379072) 1 He is progressing well, but it will be some time before his bloodpressure becomes normal again.
('68', 205, 4, 7, 379170) He seems to have worked at high pressure all these months and Dr. Jivraj and Dr. Gilder who examined him two days ago are definitely of opinion that he must have a couple of months' rest.
('68', 205, 4, 8, 379358) This he has agreed to do.
('68', 205, 4, 9, 379384) For ten days now he has been in bed resting and sleeping, never reading or writing or dictating.
('68', 205, 4, 10, 379481) But you will be surprised to know that he continued to do his reading on the commode even during these days!
('68', 205, 4, 11, 379590) And he finished the 9th Part of your magnum opuswhich it really is this evening.
('68', 205, 5, 12, 379671) And as soon as he finished it he called me to his bedside and asked me to send you his impressions.
('68', 205, 5, 13, 379771) If he had been well he should have written himself or dictated something but he did not want to strain himself in the teeth of the doctors' advice and so told me in Gujarati in a minute or two what he felt.
('68', 205, 5, 14, 379978) What I say will, therefore, be in my language and not his.
('68', 205, 5, 15, 380037) He said: It is needless to say that it is a brilliantly written book, and a great literary production.
('68', 205, 5, 16, 380140) There are parts where I have my fundamental differences with you and which I would like to criticize, but I will not do so as it is scarcely necessary or useful.
('68', 205, 5, 17, 380302) For when all is said and done it is a highly introspective narrative containing an expression of your innermost thoughts and convictions.
('68', 205, 5, 18, 380440) Even if you could be persuaded to moderate or soften that expression, I should not attempt it, as it would result in taking away from its naturalness, if not aslo its truthfulness.
('68', 205, 5, 19, 380621) After all we are helpless actors in the mighty flow of events, we have to act according to our lights allowing or expecting the events to correct us where we err.
('68', 205, 5, 20, 380784) There is just one thing where perhaps I might make a helpful suggestion.
('68', 205, 5, 21, 380857) The attack on the Liberals seems to have been overdone.
('68', 205, 5, 22, 380913) It seems to obtrude on the reader's attention over and over again and sometimes mars the grace and beauty of the narrative.
('68', 205, 5, 23, 381037) Not that there is any venom in anything that you have said; far from it; but you should not be even unconsciously guilty of doing an injustice to them.
('68', 205, 5, 24, 381189) What you have said about Sastri leaves that impression on me.
('68', 205, 5, 25, 381251) These friends served the country in their time according to their lights, and whilst we may

('68', 206, 10, 12, 381971) DEAR PADMAVATHI,
('68', 206, 11, 13, 381988) I wrote one letter to Devdas yesterday after my so called illness.
('68', 206, 11, 14, 382055) This is the second letter.
('68', 206, 11, 15, 382082) Your letter of 20th November last has been lying on my head all these days.
('68', 206, 11, 16, 382158) But I did not want to disregard doctor's warning.
('68', 206, 11, 17, 382208) Your love for Kanti 2 is very great.
('68', 206, 11, 18, 382245) May he prove worthy of it.
('68', 206, 11, 19, 382272) Personally I have no objection to the betrothal being announced.
('68', 206, 11, 20, 382337) But it may not be in Saraswathi's 3 interest.
('68', 206, 11, 21, 382383) She must have the right of refusal when she grows to her full age.
('68', 206, 11, 22, 382450) As you yourself tell me she knows very little of the understanding between you and Kanti or, say, between us.
('68', 206, 11, 23, 382560) Her mind should be left free and unfettered.
('68', 206, 11, 24, 382605) Do ask Saraswathi to write to me some lines on the strength of the old connection.

('68', 207, 4, 5, 383241) [ Before December 27,1935] 2
('68', 207, 5, 6, 383270) A dear friend on seeing Rajendra Babu's letter asking for a pamphlet, among others, on the philosophy represented by the name satyagraha asked me if I would write such a pamphlet.
('68', 207, 5, 7, 383450) Rajendra Babu who knew my preoccupations did not make any such demand upon my time.
('68', 207, 5, 8, 383534) I, therefore, pleaded my inability when the suggestion came to me.
('68', 207, 5, 9, 383601) Another suggestion was then put forward that some friend who knew my writings should make relevant extracts from them and prepare the booklet required.
('68', 207, 5, 10, 383753) I readily endorsed it.
('68', 207, 5, 11, 383776) The result was the following pages prepared after much labour of love.
('68', 207, 5, 12, 383847) The workers desire to remain unknown.
('68', 207, 5, 13, 383885) I glanced through the manuscript and I felt that the work was ably done.
('68', 207, 5, 14, 383958) I believe that it will enable the reader to appreciate the very important implications of satyagraha.
('68', 207, 5, 15, 384060) The fascination of the doctrine as an epitome of non violence is daily growing on me, and I doubt not that if an individual or a nation adopts it as a plan of life, it will promote their happiness and peace and it would be their highest contribution to the attainment of the world peace after which we are all hankering.

('68', 208, 7, 10, 385316) Not to believe in the possibility of permanent peace is to disbelieve the godliness of human nature.
('68', 208, 7, 11, 385417) Methods hitherto adopted have failed because rock bottom sincerity on the part of those who have striven has been lacking.
('68', 208, 7, 12, 385540) Not that they have realized this lack.
('68', 208, 7, 13, 385579) Peace is unattainable by part performance of conditions, even as a chemical combination is impossible without complete fulfilment of the conditions of attainment thereof.
('68', 208, 7, 14, 385750) If the recognized leaders of mankind who have control over engines of destruction were wholly to renounce their use, with full knowledge of its implications, permanent peace can be obtained.
('68', 208, 7, 15, 385941) This is clearly impossible without the great Powers of the earth renouncing their imperialistic design.
('68', 208, 7, 16, 386045) This again seems impossible without great nations ceasing to believe in soul destroying competition and to desire to multiply wants and therefore increase their material possessions.
('68', 208, 7, 17, 386228) It is my conviction that the root of the evil is want of a living faith in a living God.
('68', 208, 7, 18, 386317) It is a first class human tragedy that peoples of the earth who claim to believe in the message of Jesus who they describe as the Prince of Peace show little of that belief in actual practice.
('68', 208, 7, 19, 386510) It is painful to see sincere Christian divines limiting the scope of Jesus' message to select individuals.
('68', 208, 7, 20, 386617) I have been taught from my childhood and tested the truth by experience that the primary virtues of mankind are possible of cultivation by the meanest of the human species.
('68', 208, 7, 21, 386790) It is this undoubted universal possibility that distinguishes the humans from the rest of

('68', 211, 4, 7, 390294) Now, in any case, you should come here after finishing the work of raising contributions for the Harijan cause in a few days.

('68', 212, 2, 3, 391437) [Before January 11, 1936]
('68', 212, 3, 4, 391463) It was in the teeth of the doctors' advice that Gandhiji made an exception in favour of Japan's poet Yone Noguchi and invited him to visit him.
('68', 212, 3, 5, 391607) He said: He is not going to discuss anything with me.
('68', 212, 3, 6, 391661) I shall simply have the pleasure of listening to him.
('68', 212, 4, 7, 391715) So the poet came and saw Gandhiji in his bed lying with a wet earth bandage on his head.
('68', 212, 4, 8, 391804) Gandhiji said: I sprang from Indian earth and so it is Indian earth that crowns me.
('68', 212, 5, 9, 391888) NOGUCHI: In fundamentals, we are the same, in the virtue of negation, of simplicity, of the unification [of] poetry with life, and I am here to give you a few words of adoration.
('68', 212, 6, 10, 392067) On Gandhiji asking him his impressions of his visit to India, he said: India has deeply interested me.
('68', 212, 6, 11, 392170) So many things I have seen that I had never dreamed of seeing.
('68', 212, 6, 12, 392233) Sometimes I have had disappointments, too.
('68', 212, 6, 13, 392276) In the exhibition at Nagpur I found a new India, people very busy working ..
('68', 212, 6, 14, 392353) He asked Gandhiji if he knew anything about Japan.
('68', 212, 6, 15, 392404) Gandhiji said: Nothing except through Edwin Arnold whose descriptions 2 of Japanese life I read exactly 45 years ago with great avidity as they were appearing in his letters published weekly in an English journal.
('68', 212, 6, 16, 392618) He had married a Japanese wife and all that he wrote he did with intimate sympathy.
('68', 212, 7, 17, 392702) NOGUCHI: You are right, Arnold's book is true even today.
('68', 212, 7, 18, 392760) Without love and sympathy you cannot give a correct picture of a people.
('68', 212, 8, 19, 392833) GANDHIJI: Yes, and it is easiest to see the darker side.
('68', 212, 8, 20, 392890) You must have seen our darker side, as we know the darker side of Japan through Japan's traffic and trade rivalry.
('68', 212, 8, 21, 393005) But it is best to see the brighter side, and Japan's brighter side I know through Kagawa 3.
('68', 212, 9, 22, 393097) Kasturba came and she was introduced to the poet.
('68', 212, 9, 23, 393147) Gandhiji said: Don't you think, she is the picture of a Japanese woman?
('68', 212, 10, 24, 393219) NOGUCHI: Yes, she is like my mother.

('68', 213, 1, 2, 393454) Gandhiji was apparently unsatisfied with the very little that the poet said about India.
('68', 213, 1, 3, 393543) So he said once again: Yours is the most hospitable country in the world, I know.
('68', 213, 1, 4, 393625) I hope you found my country at least a second best.
('68', 213, 2, 5, 393677) NOGUCHI: Yours is the most hopitable.
('68', 213, 3, 6, 393715) He perhaps did not want to tax Gandhiji in his weak condition.
('68', 213, 3, 7, 393778) He said: I have nothing to ask you since your life is an open book to me.
('68', 213, 3, 8, 393852) You have had nothing to conceal.
('68', 213, 4, 9, 393885) But as he was leaving he just asked if Gandhiji would give him any message for Japan.
('68', 213, 4, 10, 393971) Gandhiji said: My message is included in the message you have received from our poet Dr. Tagore.
('68', 213, 4, 11, 394068) His message includes all the messages that many of us can give.
('68', 213, 5, 12, 394132) Gandhiji requested the poet to visit Ahmedabad and also arranged through Seth Ambalal Sarabhai an invitation to him.

('68', 219, 4, 4, 401747) I read your letter to Prabha 1. I have sent her away with her husband today.
('68', 219, 4, 5, 401824) My health is not so bad as to justify my detaining her here.

('68', 219, 4, 8, 401998) She is sitting near me.
('68', 219, 4, 9, 402022) She flatly refuses to leave the Ashram and go to Wardha.
('68', 219, 4, 10, 402079) She drinks one and a half pound of milk ever day, eats fruit and plays about with a lot of friends and studies too.
('68', 219, 4, 11, 402195) Manibehn, Vanamala and Anandibehn take all possible care of her.
('68', 219, 4, 12, 402260) Her eye is better.
('68', 219, 4, 13, 402279) It has improved the all respects.
('68', 219, 4, 14, 402313) We regularly put eye drops in them.
('68', 219, 4, 15, 402349) If, therefore, I do not receive a prohibitory order from you, I wish to take her and put her in the H. Ashram.

('68', 219, 4, 17, 402529) For the present, Ramdas seems to have left the decision to you and me.
('68', 219, 4, 18, 402600) He thinks that it would be better if you, too, go and stay in the H. Ashram.
('68', 219, 4, 19, 402677) We will think of this when we meet, provided Sumitra stays on there.
('68', 219, 4, 20, 402746) Let me have your reply before the 19th.

('68', 220, 3, 4, 403242) MIRA, I see you dread going to Segaon.
('68', 220, 3, 5, 403281) 2 Don't if you do not have the urge.
('68', 220, 3, 6, 403318) You know the verse 3 in Gita What will compulsion avail?
('68', 220, 3, 7, 403375) This is compulsion against oneself.
('68', 220, 3, 8, 403411) Resistance up to a point is a duty.
('68', 220, 3, 9, 403447) It becomes compulsion when the urge and the joy is lacking.
('68', 220, 3, 10, 403507) All resistance is good and obligatory so long as it gives us strength.
('68', 220, 3, 11, 403578) But when one is exhausted with every effort, be sure it is compulsion which must be avoided.
('68', 220, 3, 12, 403671) The evil with you is that you have compelled yourself against your will to do certain things.
('68', 220, 3, 13, 403765) This is an untruth.
('68', 220, 3, 14, 403785) Therefore don't go to Segaon unless you feel you must and will be miserable if you did not go.
('68', 220, 3, 15, 403880) Is this quite clear?

('68', 220, 7, 26, 404455) I had always been torn between the longing for the countryside and the longing to be with Bapu.
('68', 220, 7, 27, 404551) Now I had hoped that the time had come when the two longings could be fulfilled.
('68', 220, 7, 28, 404632) The situation however became very painful.
('68', 220, 7, 29, 404675) If living in Segaon was to mean perpetual separation from Bapu, my health and nerves would not be able to endure it.
('68', 220, 7, 30, 404792) Already my health was giving way under the strain which was seriously aggravated by other people telling me that if I did not stay permanently in Segaon, Bapu's blood pressure would get worse.
('68', 220, 7, 31, 404985) When Bapu became aware of the fact that my nerves were giving out, he said, if I could not live in Segaon he would himself go there. 3 Bhagavad Gita, III.

('68', 223, 11, 34, 410418) The lives of these two brothers are, in my view, very pure.

('68', 224, 1, 2, 410547) Ghaffar Khan seems to be a veritable fakir.
('68', 224, 1, 3, 410591) I see this trait in the letters he has been writing from prison.
('68', 224, 1, 4, 410656) From day to day his self abnegation has been increasing and the contemplation of God in his heart becoming more intense.
('68', 224, 1, 5, 410777) No house where Gujarati is read should be without a copy of this book.
('68', 224, 1, 6, 410848) The book is not a mere translation of the original 1 English.
('68', 224, 1, 7, 410910) The author 2 has tried to write an independent book of his own, and one acquainted with both languages can easily see that he has succeeded in the attempt.

('68', 224, 8, 15, 411334) I have been getting your letters, but I was helpless.
('68', 224, 8, 16, 411388) Of course I did have energy enough to write, but chose to follow the doctors' orders.
('68', 224, 8, 17, 411474) Now I have got the permission to write a few letters such as this.
('68', 224, 8, 18, 411541) What about the Agent's betrothal?
('68', 224, 8, 19, 411575) You write nothing about it.
('68', 224, 8, 20, 411603) Perhaps your next letter will bring the information.
('68', 224, 8, 21, 411656) If you have not written to me of this already and if there is something I should know, do write.
('68', 224, 8, 22, 411753) Write to me whatever you wish as regards Indian Opinion.
('68', 224, 8, 23, 411810) Now my health may be said to be good enough.
('68', 224, 8, 24, 411855) There never was anything to worry about.
('68', 224, 8, 25, 411896) All I needed was just rest and no more, and I am still under orders to rest myself though I have started writing a

('68', 225, 5, 8, 412581) [February 16, 1936] 3
('68', 225, 6, 9, 412603) Though I have been having rest for the last two months or more I have been constantly thinking of the rules and vows 4 of our Ashram.
('68', 225, 6, 10, 412737) Quite a number of the Ashram inmates, old and young, have given up or have failed to live up to the vows of the Ashram and I wondered if that meant that there was anything inherently defective about those vows.
('68', 225, 6, 11, 412948) But I came to the conclusion that there was no such thing and that it was well that we had kept those vows in front of us and tried, each according to his or her ability, to observe them, and that there was absolutely no cause for regret that the vows had been taken.
('68', 225, 6, 12, 413216) I am devotee of the Gita and a firm believer in the inexorable law of karma.
('68', 225, 6, 13, 413293) Even the least little tripping or stumbling is not without its cause and I have wondered why one who has tried to follow the Gita in thought, word and deed should have any ailment.
('68', 225, 6, 14, 413474) The doctors have assured me that this trouble of high blood pressure is entirely the result of mental strain and worry.
('68', 225, 6, 15, 413594) If that is true, it is likely that I have been unnecessarily worrying myself, unnessarily fretting and secretly harbouring passions like anger, lust, etc.
('68', 225, 6, 16, 413749) The fact that any event or incident should disturb my mental equilibrium, in spite of my serious efforts, means not that the Gita ideal is defective but that my devotion to it is defective.
('68', 225, 6, 17, 413939) The Gita ideal is true for all time, my understanding of it and observance of it is full of flaws.
('68', 225, 6, 18, 414038) The same is the case about the vows.
('68', 225, 6, 19, 414075) The vows are true for all time, our observance of them has

('68', 226, 1, 2, 414367) been defective.
('68', 226, 1, 3, 414383) The very contemplation of those vows is a source of perennial joy to me.
('68', 226, 1, 4, 414456) I know that several inmates of the old Satyagraha Ashram are staying here.
('68', 226, 1, 5, 414531) They must be living here for some purpose; it can be none other than service of the Harijans.
('68', 226, 1, 6, 414625) If they cherish the old vows and insist on their observance, they will be thereby rendering a service to the Harijans.
('68', 226, 1, 7, 414744) Monetary help is not the only way to serve the Harijans.
('68', 226, 1, 8, 414801) Our spirit of service and self purification may take that concrete shape, but that is not the only shape it can take.
('68', 226, 1, 9, 414919) We can, for instance, never render monetary help to the extent that Government can do.
('68', 226, 1, 10, 415006) The essence of our help consists in our passionate desire to help and suffer for them, and that desire can come only out of self purification, out of the observance of the vows we have been endeavouring to keep all these years.
('68', 226, 1, 11, 415234) That will be the measure of our service to them, and of our capacity to make them true Harijans men of God.

('68', 226, 5, 15, 415411) MY DEAR REBEL,
('68', 226, 6, 16, 415426) Your letter.
('68', 226, 6, 17, 415439) Remember Tyrant won't tolerate Rebel for long.
('68', 226, 6, 18, 415486) Rebel will have to be tamed into a slave.
('68', 226, 6, 19, 415528) Of course you can come to Wardha if you can.
('68', 226, 6, 20, 415573) That means Savli, a village about 150 miles from Wardha.
('68', 226, 6, 21, 415630) There will be the A. I. V. I. A. meeting there among other meetings,too.
('68', 226, 6, 22, 415703) There will be over 100 peoplemembers of Gandhi Seva Sangh gathered there.
('68', 226, 6, 23, 415777) We would be there for four or five days and then go to Delhi.
('68', 226, 6, 24, 415839) Of course you will stay with me in Delhi.
('68', 226, 6, 25, 415881) I shall let them know.
('68', 226, 6, 26, 415904) I walked yesterday to Harijan Ashram, 11 2 miles from Vidyapith and met there Ghaniram and his son.
('68', 226, 6, 27, 416004) Both of them are doing good work.
('68', 226, 6, 28, 416038) He showed me his invention.
('68', 226, 6, 29, 416066) I could not give him much time.
('68', 226, 6, 30, 416098) I have asked him to settle down there.
('68', 226, 6, 31, 416137) The workshop that used to be in Bardoli has been transferred to the Ashram.
('68', 226, 6, 32, 416213) Therefore there is much scope for his ability.
('68', 226, 6, 33, 416260) He seemed to be quite happy.

('68', 227, 6, 11, 416713) Jamnalalji talked with Yoga 1 for hours.
('68', 227, 6, 12, 416754) Panditji and Lakshmibehn gave them all freedom.
('68', 227, 6, 13, 416802) Jamnalalji made full use of it.
('68', 227, 6, 14, 416834) He had prolonged discussions with Panditji and Lakshmibehn also.
('68', 227, 6, 15, 416899) Yoga showed remarkable firmness.
('68', 227, 6, 16, 416932) She has never thought about you.
('68', 227, 6, 17, 416965) Although she is not particular about caste or community, she would have only a Maharashtrian Brahmin as her husband.
('68', 227, 6, 18, 417082) She says she is not under pressure of any kind.
('68', 227, 6, 19, 417130) I accept her word.
('68', 227, 6, 20, 417149) Now your duty is clear.
('68', 227, 6, 21, 417173) You must stop thinking of Yoga and relieve Panditji of his anxiety.
('68', 227, 6, 22, 417241) You have already found the Yoga of your imagination.
('68', 227, 6, 23, 417294) She is not this Yoga, though she may have been instrumental in bringing it about.
('68', 227, 6, 24, 417376) This has been to your good in the sense that your constantly thinking of her has added to the purity of your soul.
('68', 227, 6, 25, 417491) May your meditation of the Yoga of (your) imagination free you from all fears and temptations.
('68', 227, 6, 26, 417586) But do not ever identify this physical Yoga with the Yoga of your imagination.
('68', 227, 6, 27, 417665) Let me stop with this today.
('68', 227, 6, 28, 417694) I shall explain the rest on my arrival there.
('68', 227, 6, 29, 417740) I shall explain to you your duty more clearly.

('68', 229, 7, 13, 420098) They are all contained in the prayer you have just now recited.
('68', 229, 7, 14, 420162) We have all to march from untruth to truth, from darkness to light .Truth is at the very root of all our aims and vows and the plant of truth will not grow and fructify if you do not water its roots with ahimsa.
('68', 229, 7, 15, 420374) But for you the truth lies in cultivating true rural mindedness.
('68', 229, 7, 16, 420439) The Vidyapith was started in order to make the children of city dwellers real servants of villages and we devised our curricula with that end in view.
('68', 229, 7, 17, 420590) But you are not children of city dwellers.You come from villages, you are children of villagers who have gone through suffering and sacrifice in the fight for freedom, and your duty towards the villages is therefore greater.

('68', 230, 10, 22, 422317) They are very good.
('68', 230, 10, 23, 422337) It is no surprise to me to learn that you have been doing much public service, for you have accepted service to others as your religion.

('68', 231, 4, 5, 422810) I learnt only recently from Sardar that you had been quite ill.
('68', 231, 4, 6, 422874) They have permitted me now to write a few letters and hence I am writing this.
('68', 231, 4, 7, 422953) Write or ask somebody to write to me what your illness is.
('68', 231, 4, 8, 423012) Do get well soon, for I have still much work to take from you.

('68', 232, 4, 5, 423680) How is it that I have heard nothing from you after your letter to Kanti from Hathras?
('68', 232, 4, 6, 423766) I hope you got the letter 1 I wrote the very next day after you left.
('68', 232, 4, 7, 423836) You shouldnt be lazy in writing.
('68', 232, 4, 8, 423869) I write this from Bardoli.
('68', 232, 4, 9, 423896) I am in good health, and Kanti and Kanu are doing your part of the work ably enough.
('68', 232, 4, 10, 423981) At the time of leaving, my weight was 112 lb.
('68', 232, 4, 11, 424027) and the blood pressure 150 90. I expect you are keeping good health and taking milk regularly.
('68', 232, 4, 12, 424122) I am reminded of you by the daily use of your mirror, pattu 2, lamp and scissors.
('68', 232, 4, 13, 424204) You have forgotten to take with you your khaddar shoes, which are in safe custody here.
('68', 232, 4, 14, 424292) You ought to take up some studies there at any rate.

('68', 232, 9, 19, 424472) ANASUYABEHN,
('68', 232, 10, 20, 424485) Unable to resist your love I brought along your gift with me here.
('68', 232, 10, 21, 424552) And today I had a look at them.
('68', 232, 10, 22, 424584) The bowl is made in Germany.
('68', 232, 10, 23, 424613) The razor of course is foreign made, your dharma and mine lies in making do with things made in our villages (not even in our cities).
('68', 232, 10, 24, 424748) For this reason and in pursuance of the ideal of non possession I manage without many things.
('68', 232, 10, 25, 424842) So while on tour I shave with whatever razor I can get hold of.
('68', 232, 10, 26, 424906) In Wardha there is a nationalist barber who shaves me with a village made razor.
('68', 232, 10, 27, 424987) Such being the situation, how can I make use of your bowl and things?

('68', 233, 1, 3, 425286) These thoughts strike me most poignantly here in Bardoli.
('68', 233, 1, 4, 425344) Hence this letter.
('68', 233, 1, 5, 425363) Here they have built a hut for me under a mango tree.
('68', 233, 1, 6, 425417) The walls are of dried stems of tuver in a framework of bamboo.
('68', 233, 1, 7, 425481) Khadi has been used where found necessary.
('68', 233, 1, 8, 425524) Not a single pie has been spent in making the hut.
('68', 233, 1, 9, 425575) When I leave here all the building material of the hut will be returned to its original users.
('68', 233, 1, 10, 425670) You will also be happy to see the hut.
('68', 233, 1, 11, 425709) The village industry movement includes such activities.
('68', 233, 1, 12, 425765) I shall find some use for the things I have accepted.
('68', 233, 1, 13, 425819) It will suffice if this incident remains a guide for the future.
('68', 233, 1, 14, 425884) Not only should you not incur any unnecessary expense on my account, but anything you buy for me should be of village manufacture.
('68', 233, 1, 15, 426015) The same consideration should apply to whatever you buy for yourself or for the Majoor Mahajan.
('68', 233, 1, 16, 426111) I am keeping fit.
('68', 233, 1, 17, 426129) Here, too, I have enough leisure, so there is no cause for worry.

('68', 233, 5, 21, 426301) [February 21, 1936] 2
('68', 233, 6, 22, 426323) GANDHIJI: Is the prejudice against colour growing or dying out?
('68', 233, 7, 23, 426387) THURMAN 3: It is difficult to say because in one place things look much improved, whilst in another the outlook is still dark.
('68', 233, 7, 24, 426514) Among many of the Southern white students there is a disposition to improve upon the a attitude of their forbears, and the nigration occasioned by the World War did contribute appreciably to break down the barriers.
('68', 233, 7, 25, 426730) But the economic question is acute everywhere, and in many of the industrial centres in Middle West the prejudice against the Negro shows itself in its ugliest form.
('68', 233, 7, 26, 426896) Among the masses of workers there is a great amount of tension, which
('68', 233, 8, 27, 426966) 1 This appeared under the title With Our Negro Guests by Mahadev Desai.
('68', 233, 8, 28, 427038) According to Mahadev Desai, the meeting was the first engagement of an important nature undertaken by Gandhiji since the breakdown in his health.

('68', 234, 1, 2, 427327) is quite natural when the white thinks that the Negros very existence is a threat to his own.
('68', 234, 2, 3, 427421) G. Is the union between Negroes and the whites recognized by law?
('68', 234, 3, 4, 427487) CARROL 1 Twenty five States have laws definitely against these unions, and I have had to sign a bond of 500 dollars to promise that I would not register any such union.
('68', 234, 4, 5, 427656) T. But there has been a lot of intermixture of races as for 300 years or more the Negro woman had no control over her body.
('68', 234, 4, 6, 427780) Did the South African Negro take any part in your movement?
('68', 234, 5, 7, 427840) G. No, I purposely did not invite them.
('68', 234, 5, 8, 427880) It would have endangered their cause.
('68', 234, 5, 9, 427918) They would not have understood the technique of our struggle nor could they have seen the purpose or utility non violence.
('68', 234, 6, 10, 428041) This led to a very interesting discussion of the state of Christianity among the South African Negroes and Gandhiji explained at great length why Islam scored against Christianity there.
('68', 234, 6, 11, 428228) We are often told, said Dr. Thurman, that but for the Arabs there would have been no slavery.
('68', 234, 6, 12, 428322) I do not believe it.
('68', 234, 7, 13, 428343) G. No, it is not true at all.
('68', 234, 7, 14, 428373) For, the moment a slave accepts Islam he obtains equality with his master, and there are several instances of this in history.
('68', 234, 8, 15, 428500) The whole discussion led to many a question and cross question during which the guests had an occasion to see that Gandhijis principle of equal respect for all religions was no theoretical formula but a practical creed.
('68', 234, 8, 16, 428720) Is non violence from your point of view a form of direct actioninquired Dr. Thurman.
('68', 234, 9, 17, 428805) G. It is not one form, it is the only form.
('68', 234, 9, 18, 428849) I do not of course confine the words direct action to their technical meaning.
('68', 234, 9, 19, 428928) But without a direct active expression of it, non violence to my mind is meaningless.
('68', 234, 9, 20, 429014) It is the greatest and the activest force in the world.
('68', 234, 9, 21, 429070) One cannot be passively non violent.
('68', 234, 9, 22, 429107) In factnon violence is a term I had to coin in order to bring out the root meaning of ahimsa.
('68', 234, 9, 23, 429201) In spite of the negative particle non, it is no negative force.
('68', 234, 9, 24, 429265) Superficially we are surrounded in life by strife and bloodshed, life living upon life.
('68', 234, 9, 25, 429353) But some great seer, who ages ago penetrated the centre of truth, said: It is not through strife and violence, but through non violence that man can fulfil his destiny and his duty to his fellow creatures.
('68', 234, 9, 26, 429559) It is a force which is more positive than electricity and more powerful than even ether.
('68', 234, 9, 27, 429648) At the centre of non violence is a force which is self acting.

('68', 235, 0, 1, 429729) 236 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('68', 235, 1, 2, 429771) Ahimsa means love in the Pauline sense, and yet something more than the love defined by St. Paul, although I know St. Paul's beautiful definition is good enough for all practical purposes.
('68', 235, 1, 3, 429960) Ahimsa includes the whole creation, and not only human.
('68', 235, 1, 4, 430016) Besides, love in the English language has other connotations too, and so I was compelled to use the negative word.
('68', 235, 1, 5, 430131) But it does not, as I have told you, express a negative force, but a force superior to all the forces put together.
('68', 235, 1, 6, 430247) One person who can express ahimsa in life exercises a force superior to all the forces of brutality.
('68', 235, 2, 7, 430348) Q. And is it possible for any individual to achieve this?
('68', 235, 3, 8, 430406) G. Certainly.
('68', 235, 3, 9, 430420) If there was any exclusiveness about it, I should reject it at once.
('68', 235, 4, 10, 430489) Q. Any idea of possession is foreign to it?
('68', 235, 5, 11, 430533) G. Yes.
('68', 235, 5, 12, 430541) It possesses nothing, therefore it possesses everything.
('68', 235, 6, 13, 430598) Q. Is it possible for a single human being to resist the persistent invasion of the quality successfully?
('68', 235, 7, 14, 430704) G. It is possible.
('68', 235, 7, 15, 430723) Perhaps your question is more universal than you mean.
('68', 235, 7, 16, 430778) Isn't it possible, you mean to ask, for one single Indian for instance to resist the exploitation of 300 million Indians?
('68', 235, 7, 17, 430900) Or do you mean the onslaught of the whole world against a single individual personality?
('68', 235, 8, 18, 430989) DR.T. Yes, that is one half of the question.
('68', 235, 8, 19, 431034) I wanted to know if one man can hold the whole violence at bay?
('68', 235, 9, 20, 431098) G. If he cannot, you must take it that he is not a true representative of ahimsa.
('68', 235, 9, 21, 431180) Supposing I cannot produce a single instance in life of a man who truly converted his adversary, I would then say that is because no one had yet been found to express ahimsa in its fulness.
('68', 235, 10, 22, 431370) Q. Then it overrides all other forces?
('68', 235, 11, 23, 431409) G. Yes, it is the only true force in life.
('68', 235, 12, 24, 431452) DR.T. Forgive the weakness, but may I ask how are we to train individuals or communities in this difficult art?
('68', 235, 13, 25, 431564) G. There is no royal road, except through living the creed in your life which must be a living sermon.
('68', 235, 13, 26, 431667) Of course the expression in one's own life presupposes great study, tremendous perseverance, and thorough cleansing of one's self of all the impurities.
('68', 235, 13, 27, 431820) If for mastering of the physical sciences you have to devote a whole lifetime, how many lifetimes may be needed for mastering the greatest spiritual

('68', 236, 1, 2, 432015) force that mankind has known?
('68', 236, 1, 3, 432045) But why worry even if it means several lifetimes?
('68', 236, 1, 4, 432095) For if this is the only permanent thing in life, if this is the only thing that counts,then whatever effort you bestow on mastering it is well spent.
('68', 236, 1, 5, 432245) Seek ye first the kingdom of Heaven and everything else shall be added unto you.
('68', 236, 1, 6, 432326) The Kingdom of Heaven is ahimsa.
('68', 236, 2, 7, 432359) MRS.T. How am I to act, supposing my own brother was lynched before my very eyes?
('68', 236, 3, 8, 432441) G. There is such a thing as self immolation.
('68', 236, 3, 9, 432486) Supposing I was a Negro, and my sister was ravished by a white or lynched by a whole community, what would be my duty? I ask myself.
('68', 236, 3, 10, 432619) And the answer comes to me: I must not wish ill to these, but neither must I co operate with them.
('68', 236, 3, 11, 432718) It may be that ordinarily I depend on the lynching community for my livelihood.
('68', 236, 3, 12, 432798) I refuse to co operate with them, refuse even to touch the food that comes from them, and I refuse to co operate with even my brother Negroes who tolerate the wrong.
('68', 236, 3, 13, 432964) That is the self immolation I mean.
('68', 236, 3, 14, 433000) I have often in my life resorted to the plan.
('68', 236, 3, 15, 433046) Of course a mechanical act of starvation will mean nothing.
('68', 236, 3, 16, 433106) One's faith must remain undimmed whilst life ebbs out minute by minute.
('68', 236, 3, 17, 433178) But I am a very poor specimen of the practice of non violence, and my answer may not convince you.
('68', 236, 3, 18, 433277) But I am striving very hard, and even if I do not succeed fully in this life, my faith will not diminish.
('68', 236, 4, 19, 433383) We want you to come to America, said the guests.
('68', 236, 5, 20, 433432) MRS.T. We want you not for white America, but for the Negroes; we have many a problem that cries for solution, and we need you badly.
('68', 236, 6, 21, 433566) G. How I wish I could, but I would have nothing to give you unless I had given an ocular demonstration here of all that I have been saying.
('68', 236, 6, 22, 433706) I must make good the message here before I bring it to you.
('68', 236, 6, 23, 433766) I do not say that I am defeated, but I have still to perfect myself.
('68', 236, 6, 24, 433835) You may be sure that the moment I feel the call within me I shall not hesitate.
('68', 236, 7, 25, 433915) DR.T. Much of the peculiar background of our own life in America is our own interpretation of the Christian religion.
('68', 236, 7, 26, 434033) When one goes through the pages of the hundreds of Negro spirituals, striking things are brought to my mind which remind me of all that you have told us today.
('68', 236, 8, 27, 434193) G. Well, if it comes true it may be through the Negroes that the

('68', 237, 3, 4, 434389) 310. SPEECH AT VILLAGE WORKERS MEETING 2
('68', 237, 4, 5, 434430) BARDOLI, February 22, 1936
('68', 237, 5, 6, 434457) The first question was about the duties of the village workers.
('68', 237, 5, 7, 434521) The only duty of the village worker was to serve the villagers, said Gandhiji, and he could best serve them if he kept the eleven vows 3 in front of him as a beacon light.
('68', 237, 6, 8, 434693) The other question was about the livelihood of the village worker.
('68', 237, 6, 9, 434760) How was he to earn it?
('68', 237, 6, 10, 434783) Was he to draw an allowance from an institution, or to earn it by labouring for it, or to depend upon the village for it?
('68', 237, 6, 11, 434905) The ideal way, said Gandhiji, was to depend upon the village.
('68', 237, 6, 12, 434967) There was no shame therein, but humility.
('68', 237, 6, 13, 435009) There was no scope for self indulgence either, for he could not think of a village which would encourage or tolerate self indulgence.
('68', 237, 6, 14, 435143) All that the worker need do was to work for the village all his working hours, and to collect whatever grain and vegetables he needed from the village.
('68', 237, 6, 15, 435295) He might collect a little money too (for postage and other monetary expenditure) if he should need it, though Gandhiji did not think he could not do without it.
('68', 237, 6, 16, 435456) The village would willingly support him if he had gone there at the invitation of the village.
('68', 237, 6, 17, 435551) He could conceive an occasion when the villagers might not be able to tolerate his views and withdraw their support, as, for instance, they did when he admitted untouchables in the Satyagraha Ashram in 1915. Then he should work for his living.
('68', 237, 6, 18, 435795) It was no use depending on an institution.
('68', 237, 7, 19, 435838) The third question was about body labour.
('68', 237, 7, 20, 435880) The village worker was in the village to do as much body labour as possible and to teach the villagers to outgrow idleness.
('68', 237, 7, 21, 436004) He might do any kind of labour, but give preference to scavenging.
('68', 237, 7, 22, 436071) Scavenging was certainly productive labour.
('68', 237, 7, 23, 436115) He liked some of the workers' insistence on devoting at least half an hour to work entirely of service and of a productive kind.
('68', 237, 8, 24, 436244) 1 Before taking leave of Gandhiji Mrs. Thurman sang two famous Negro spirituals: Were you there, when they crucified my Lord and We are climbing Jacob's ladder. 2 The Gujarati original appeared in Harijanbandhu, 1 3 1936. The village workers gave a list of questions to Gandhiji and requested him to enlighten them.
('68', 237, 8, 25, 436560) 3 Non violence, truth, non stealing, brahmacharya, non possession, bodylabour, control of the palate, fearlessness, equal respect for all religions, swadeshi (restricting oneself to the use and service of one's nearest surroundings in preference to those more remote) and spirit of unexclusive brotherhood
('68', 238, 0, 1, 436866) VOL. 68 : 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 239
('68', 238, 1, 2, 436912) Scavenging certainly came under that category.
('68', 238, 1, 3, 436959) Also grinding; for money saved is money got.
('68', 238, 2, 4, 437004) The fourth question was about maintaining a diary.
('68', 238, 2, 5, 437055) Gandhiji had no doubt that the village worker must be prepared to account for every minute of his waking hours and must fill them with work and mention it distenctly in his diary.
('68', 238, 2, 6, 437235) A real diary was a mirror of the diarist's mind and soul, but many might find it difficult to make a truthful record of their mind's activities.
('68', 238, 2, 7, 437380) In that case they might confine themselves to a record of their physical activities.
('68', 238, 2, 8, 437465) But it should not be done in a haphazard way.
('68', 238, 2, 9, 437511) Simply sayng, Worked in the kitchen would not do.
('68', 238, 2, 10, 437561) One may have whiled away one's time in the kitchen.
('68', 238, 2, 11, 437613) Specific items of work should be mentioned.
('68', 238, 3, 12, 437657) The fifth question was about work among Dublas who work more or lesss as serfs in certain parts of Gujarat.
('68', 238, 3, 13, 437765) Service of Dublas, said Gandhiji, meant readiness to share their toil and their hardships, and to get into touch with their masters and to see that they dealt with them justly and kindly.
('68', 238, 4, 14, 437953) Summing up, Gandhiji said: The village worker will leave politics alone.
('68', 238, 4, 15, 438026) He may become a Congress member, but he may not take part in an election campaign.
('68', 238, 4, 16, 438109) He has his work cut out for himself.
('68', 238, 4, 17, 438146) The Village Industries Association and the Spinners' Association were both created by the Congress.
('68', 238, 4, 18, 438246) and yet they work independently of the Congress.
('68', 238, 4, 19, 438295) That is why they and their members steer clear of all Congress politics.
('68', 238, 4, 20, 438368) That is the non violent way.
('68', 238, 4, 21, 438397) He will also leave village factions alone.
('68', 238, 4, 22, 438440) He must go and settle there determined to do without most of the things he does not do without in a city.
('68', 238, 4, 23, 438546) If I sit down in a village I should have to decide what things I should not take with me in the village, however inherently harmless those things may be.
('68', 238, 4, 24, 438700) The question is whether those things will sort well or ill with the life of an ordinary villager.
('68', 238, 4, 25, 438798) He will be incorruptible and stand like a rock against the inroad of temptations and save the village from them.
('68', 238, 4, 26, 438911) Even one pure soul can save a whole village, as one Vibhishana 1 saved Lanka.
('68', 238, 4, 27, 438989) Sodom and Gomorrah were not destroyed so long as there was one pure soul left in them.
('68', 238, 4, 28, 439076) 2 That is why I said long ago that I would far rather that India perished than sacrifice truth in order to save it.

('68', 239, 3, 4, 439378) MY DEAR REBEL,
('68', 239, 4, 5, 439393) Kumarappa handed me your welcome longish letter at the station.
('68', 239, 4, 6, 439457) The prescription for flit is twice welcome.
('68', 239, 4, 7, 439501) I needed it.
('68', 239, 4, 8, 439514) It will duly appear in Harijan without your name.
('68', 239, 4, 9, 439564) The parcel will arrive in due course.
('68', 239, 4, 10, 439602) How wise of me to have let you cut out 1 2 yard!
('68', 239, 4, 11, 439651) When the articles come the artless tyrant will duly examine [the] so called art of the rebel.
('68', 239, 4, 12, 439745) Let the rebel however know in advance that sometimes art lies in not interfering with nature's unevenness and irregular curves and lines.
('68', 239, 4, 13, 439883) Fancy hammering the earth into a perfect sphere!
('68', 239, 4, 14, 439932) Perhaps then we should cease to be.
('68', 239, 4, 15, 439968) So you see, if I certify your art, it will be a feather in your cap.
('68', 239, 4, 16, 440037) But then you will have to sport a cap to wear the feather!
('68', 239, 4, 17, 440096) This shows how well I must be in spite of the journey.
('68', 239, 4, 18, 440151) I am sorry you can't come to Savli.
('68', 239, 4, 19, 440187) We shall see, when we meet in Delhi, what you will or can do in the nature of service.
('68', 239, 4, 20, 440274) Your appointments will leave you no time.

('68', 240, 2, 3, 440472) February 24, 1936 CHI.
('68', 240, 2, 4, 440495) PRABHA, I got your two letters together.
('68', 240, 2, 5, 440536) You caused me a little anxiety, for you were told to write immediately after reaching, were you not?
('68', 240, 2, 6, 440637) You may certainly go to Mother, if there is nothing for Jayaprakash that you might have to do, that is, if there is no service to render him.
('68', 240, 2, 7, 440779) You may visit your other relatives, if you have to.
('68', 240, 2, 8, 440831) However, you ought to stay with him if he accepts your services and eats the food you cook.
('68', 240, 2, 9, 440923) You may come to me after seeing your elders if he is not at all in need of your services and you can gain your freedom gladly.
('68', 240, 2, 10, 441050) Before coming, however, it should be clear that you will come not to render me any special personal service but to do the task that I might assign to you.
('68', 240, 2, 11, 441205) Is this clear?
('68', 240, 2, 12, 441220) The language you write is good enough.
('68', 240, 2, 13, 441259) You have secured a good command over Gujarati.
('68', 240, 2, 14, 441306) Mind you preserve your health.
('68', 240, 2, 15, 441337) You should insist on Jayaprakash following the remedies needed for his health.
('68', 240, 2, 16, 441416) We reached Wardha safely yesterday.
('68', 240, 2, 17, 441452) We are putting up at Kanya Ashram.
('68', 240, 2, 18, 441487) Kanti and Kanu look after me.

('68', 240, 2, 20, 441540) Mirabehn is sitting near me; but she does not take part in any work of service.
('68', 240, 2, 21, 441620) Kanti will write the rest.
('68', 240, 2, 22, 441647) Dont be lazy in writing to me.

('68', 242, 3, 4, 443573) MY DEAR REBEL,
('68', 242, 4, 5, 443588) Ghee from cow's milk I cannot take.
('68', 242, 4, 6, 443624) I can take only goat's milk and its products.

('68', 242, 4, 9, 443729) The ends are well made.
('68', 242, 4, 10, 443753) But they will not suit dhotis as you will realize when we meet.
('68', 242, 4, 11, 443817) But they will be used as upper sheets which as you know I wear.

('68', 242, 10, 28, 444613) It was taken immediately after the meal to test what effect garlic had.
('68', 242, 10, 29, 444685) I would have felt miserable if I had been prevented from coming to Segaon.
('68', 242, 10, 30, 444760) Jamnalal Bajaj was superb.
('68', 242, 10, 31, 444787) He suppressed his feeling and let me come.

('68', 245, 1, 2, 447154) 323. NOTHING WITHOUT GRACE
('68', 245, 2, 3, 447181) By the grace of medical friends and self constituted gaolers, Sardar Vallabhbhai and Jamnalalji, I am now able by way of trial to resume to a limited extent my talks with the readers of Harijan.
('68', 245, 2, 4, 447376) The restrictions that they have put on my liberty and to which I have agreed, are that, for the time being at any rate, I shall not write for Harijan more than I may consider to be absolutely necessary and that, too, not involving more than a few hours' writing per week.
('68', 245, 2, 5, 447648) I shall not carry on private correspondence with reference to correspondents' personal problems or domestic difficulties, except those with which I have already concerned myself, and I shall not accept public engagements or attend or speak at public gatherings.
('68', 245, 2, 6, 447910) There are positive directions about sleep, recreation, exercise and food, with which the reader is not concerned and with which therefore I need not deal.
('68', 245, 2, 7, 448065) I hope that the readers of Harijan and correspondents will co operate with me and Mahadev Desai, who has in the first instance to attend to all correspondence, in the observance of these restrictions.
('68', 245, 2, 8, 448266) It will interest the reader to know something about the origin of the breakdown and the measures taken to cope with it.
('68', 245, 2, 9, 448386) So far as I have understood the medical friends, after a very careful and painstaking examination of my system they have found no functional derangement.
('68', 245, 2, 10, 448540) Their opinion is that the breakdown was most probably due to deficiency of proteins and carbohydrates in the form of sugar and starches, coupled with overstrain for a prolonged period involving long hours and concentration on numerous taxing private problems in addition to the performance of daily public duty.
('68', 245, 2, 11, 448852) So far as I can recollect I had been complaining for the past twelve months or more that, if I did not curtail the volume of ever growing work, I was sure to break down.
('68', 245, 2, 12, 449022) Therefore when it came, it was nothing new to me.
('68', 245, 2, 13, 449072) And it is highly likely that the world would have heard little of it but for the over anxiety of one of the friends who, on seeing me indisposed, sent a sensational note to Jamnalalji who gathered together all the medical talent that was available in Wardha and sent messages to Nagpur and Bombay for further help.
('68', 245, 2, 14, 449387) The day I collapsed I had a warning on rising in the morning that there was some unusual pain about the neck, but I made light of it and never mentioned it to anybody.
('68', 245, 2, 15, 449555) I continued to go through the
('68', 246, 0, 1, 449585) VOL. 68 : 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 247
('68', 246, 1, 2, 449631) daily programme.
('68', 246, 1, 3, 449648) The final stroke was a most exhausting and serious conversation I had with a friend whilst I was having the daily evening stroll.
('68', 246, 1, 4, 449778) The nerves had already been sufficiently taxed during the preceding fortnight with the consideration and solution of problems which for me were quite as big and as important as, say, the paramount question of swaraj.
('68', 246, 1, 5, 449995) Even if no fuss had been made over the collapse, I would have taken nature's peremptory warning to heart, given myself moderate rest and tided over the difficulty.
('68', 246, 1, 6, 450159) But looking back upon the past I feel that it was well that the fuss was made.
('68', 246, 1, 7, 450238) The extraordinary precautions advised by the medical friends and equally extraordinary care taken by the two gaolers enforced on me the exacting rest which I would not have taken and which allowed ample time for introspection.
('68', 246, 1, 8, 450465) Not only have I profited by it but the introspection has revealed vital defects in my following out of the interpretation of the Gita as I have understood it.
('68', 246, 1, 9, 450624) I have discovered that I have not approached with adequate detachment the innumerable problems that have presented themselves for solution.
('68', 246, 1, 10, 450764) It is clear that I have taken many of them to heart and allowed them to rouse my emotional being and thus affect my nerves.
('68', 246, 1, 11, 450888) In other words they have not, as they should have in a votary of the Gita, left my body or mind untouched.
('68', 246, 1, 12, 450995) I verily believe that one who literally follows the prescription of the eternal Mother need never grow old in mind.
('68', 246, 1, 13, 451111) Such a one's body will wither in due course like leaves of a healthy tree, leaving the mind as young and as fresh as ever.
('68', 246, 1, 14, 451234) That seems to me to be the meaning of Bhishma delivering his marvellous discourse to Yudhishthira though he was on his death bed.
('68', 246, 1, 15, 451364) Medical friends were never tired of warning me against being excited over or affected by events happening around me.
('68', 246, 1, 16, 451481) Extra precautions were taken to keep from me news of a tragic character.
('68', 246, 1, 17, 451554) Though, I think, I was not quite so bad a devotee of the Gita as their precautions Lead me to suppose, there was undoubtedly substance behind them.
('68', 246, 1, 18, 451702) For I discovered with what a wrench I accepted Jamnalalji's conditions and demand that I should remove from Maganwadi to Mahila Ashram.
('68', 246, 1, 19, 451838) Anyway I had lost credit with him for detached action.
('68', 246, 1, 20, 451893) The fact of the collapse was for him eloquent enough testimony for discrediting my vaunted detachment.
('68', 246, 1, 21, 451996) I must plead guilty to the condemnation.
('68', 246, 1, 22, 452037) The worst however was to follow.
('68', 246, 1, 23, 452070) I have been trying to follow brahmacharya consciously and deliberately since 1899. My definition of it is purity not merely of body but of both speech and
('68', 247, 0, 1, 452225) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 248
('68', 247, 1, 2, 452267) thought also.
('68', 247, 1, 3, 452281) With the exception of what must be regarded as one lapse, I can recall no instance, during more than thirty six years' constant and conscious effort, of mental disturbance such as I experienced during this illness.
('68', 247, 1, 4, 452496) I was disgusted with myself.
('68', 247, 1, 5, 452525) The moment the feeling came I acquainted my attendants and the medical friends with my condition.
('68', 247, 1, 6, 452623) They could give me no help.
('68', 247, 1, 7, 452651) I expected none.
('68', 247, 1, 8, 452668) I broke loose after the experience from the rigid rest that was imposed upon me.
('68', 247, 1, 9, 452749) The confession of the wretched experience brought much relief to me.
('68', 247, 1, 10, 452818) I felt as if a great load had been raised from over me.
('68', 247, 1, 11, 452874) It enabled me to pull myself together before any harm could be done.
('68', 247, 1, 12, 452943) 1 But what of the Gita?
('68', 247, 1, 13, 452967) Its teaching is clear and precise.
('68', 247, 1, 14, 453002) A mind that is once hooked to the Star of stars becomes incorruptible.
('68', 247, 1, 15, 453073) How far I must be from Him, He alone knows.
('68', 247, 1, 16, 453117) Thank God, my much vaunted Mahatmaship has never fooled me.
('68', 247, 1, 17, 453177) But this enforced rest has humbled me as never before.
('68', 247, 1, 18, 453232) It has brought to the surface my limitations and imperfections.
('68', 247, 1, 19, 453296) But I am not so much ashamed of them, as I should be of hiding them from the public.
('68', 247, 1, 20, 453381) My faith in the message of the Gita is as bright as ever.
('68', 247, 1, 21, 453439) Unwearied ceaseless effort is the price that must be paid for turning that faith into rich infallible experience.
('68', 247, 1, 22, 453553) But the same Gita says without any equivocation that the experience is not to be had without divine grace.
('68', 247, 1, 23, 453660) We should develop swelled heads if Divinity had not made that ample reservation.

('68', 247, 4, 28, 453869) Of course we do feel pained at the death of anyone and, from that standpoint, there is certainly pain at the death of your husband.
('68', 247, 4, 29, 454001) You have not become a widow, and if you think you have, you were as much a widow in your married state.
('68', 247, 4, 30, 454105) I expect you do not think that there has been any change in this state.
('68', 247, 4, 31, 454177) Carry out your duty firmly.
('68', 247, 4, 32, 454205) If you get the custody of your child, rear him.
('68', 247, 4, 33, 454253) Do not ever get your head shaved.
('68', 247, 4, 34, 454287) I see no need for any change in your way of life.
('68', 247, 4, 35, 454337) In my view, it is your duty to continue your work of service as before.
('68', 247, 4, 36, 454409) May God grant you the good sense and the strength to do your duty.

('68', 248, 5, 6, 454796) SALVI, February 29, 1936
('68', 248, 6, 7, 454821) The truth is that I have come here after opening the exhibition.
('68', 248, 6, 8, 454886) I thought that first I would see the exhibition and then tell you what was worth seeing there.
('68', 248, 6, 9, 454981) Just now you have heard the reports of those who have brought exhibits from other parts.
('68', 248, 6, 10, 455070) When I was told that an exhibition was to be held here I had an impression that there would be things produced in Savli and the neighbouring villages.
('68', 248, 6, 11, 455221) They would not be numerous.
('68', 248, 6, 12, 455249) Khadi work is being carried on here.
('68', 248, 6, 13, 455286) Fine khadi is made.
('68', 248, 6, 14, 455306) The Harijans get their livelihood from it, because most of the workers are Harijans.
('68', 248, 6, 15, 455391) From this point of view I feel the lack of the different processes and types of khadi.
('68', 248, 6, 16, 455478) The reason given for this isand it may be a correct onethat we would see Savli closely, study it well and would try to measure in a better way Savli's capacity in khadi production.
('68', 248, 6, 17, 455659) For the last two or three months efforts were being made for the members to meet here.
('68', 248, 6, 18, 455746) For this reason I had expected that you would try in the mean time and exhibit articles made here.
('68', 248, 6, 19, 455845) Had this been done, all of us would have had the opportunity to see what Savli could do.
('68', 248, 6, 20, 455934) But this criticism should be borne in mind for the future.
('68', 248, 6, 21, 455993) The sessions of our Sangh will always be held in villages.
('68', 248, 6, 22, 456052) On such occasions we should undertake a study of the local industries and the products to explore the potentialities of the place and content ourselves with exhibiting only the things that it can produce.
('68', 248, 6, 23, 456257) We must also see that we do not confuse the aims of such exhibitions with those of a museum.
('68', 248, 6, 24, 456350) There can be a display of ancient things which have no connection with our economic life.
('68', 248, 6, 25, 456440) But such museums should be where they belong; they have no place in our sessions.
('68', 248, 6, 26, 456522) Our duty is to concentrate on only those industries and crafts which are capable of
('68', 248, 7, 27, 456606) 1 At its second annual meeting
('68', 249, 0, 1, 456637) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 250
('68', 249, 1, 2, 456679) being revived.
('68', 249, 1, 3, 456694) Now when you go and see the exhibition, also note what things are not there and what could have been included.
('68', 249, 1, 4, 456805) A circular had been sent to you about what you were to bring when coming here.
('68', 249, 1, 5, 456884) It asked you to bring a lantern, writing material, postcards, envelopes, stamps, etc.
('68', 249, 1, 6, 456970) The circular was appropriate because these things are not available in villages.
('68', 249, 1, 7, 457051) More than 80% of the villagers are illiterate.
('68', 249, 1, 8, 457098) So who would store these things for sale?
('68', 249, 1, 9, 457140) It would have been an unnecessary expenditure if lanterns were provided by the Sangh.
('68', 249, 1, 10, 457226) The circular also mentioned that it was difficult to procure milk in Savli and cow's milk was practically unprocurable.
('68', 249, 1, 11, 457346) Those who needed cow's ghee were instructed to bring their own supply.
('68', 249, 1, 12, 457417) After coming here you would have discovered that buffalo's milk has been provided for you.
('68', 249, 1, 13, 457508) You would hardly know that your milk supply comes from Chanda 1 and vegetables from Nagpur 2. I think it is sinful.
('68', 249, 1, 14, 457624) It was our duty to have had cows here instead of getting milk and vegetables from such a long distance.
('68', 249, 1, 15, 457728) So many of our people live here.
('68', 249, 1, 16, 457761) They could always have kept some cows.
('68', 249, 1, 17, 457800) Of course it would have meant some expenditure.
('68', 249, 1, 18, 457848) It is possible that less expenditure is incurred in procuring milk from Chanda.
('68', 249, 1, 19, 457928) But the higher expenditure would not have been improper.
('68', 249, 1, 20, 457985) We should have also had vegetables grown here.
('68', 249, 1, 21, 458032) We should have informed the farmers two or three months in advance that three to four hundred of our people were coming to stay here for a week.
('68', 249, 1, 22, 458177) We would require so many maunds of vegetables daily and they should right then plan their farms to meet the needs.
('68', 249, 1, 23, 458292) They would have gladly welcomed your suggestion and would have thanked you for having decided to have the session at Savli.
('68', 249, 1, 24, 458416) It is better to do without milk or vegetables for a week if such local arrangements are not possible.
('68', 249, 1, 25, 458518) Arrangements should be made for sick persons or people like me who cannot do without milk or vegetables and that, too, from the supply that is locally available.
('68', 249, 1, 26, 458680) A pertinent question is: why should they take the trouble of coming such a long distance?
('68', 249, 1, 27, 458770) We should keep it in mind that we should be able to benefit the villagers to the maximum from our stay there.
('68', 249, 1, 28, 458880) At least we should try to do so.
('68', 249, 1, 29, 458913) We should try and get the necessary things made there.
('68', 249, 1, 30, 458968) If we incur an expenditure of Rs. 3,000 over such a

('68', 250, 4, 6, 459371) SAVLI, March 1, 1936
('68', 250, 5, 7, 459392) I shall devote one hour every day to the session.
('68', 250, 5, 8, 459442) During that time I can speak for about half an hour at the most, and the remaining half hour will be spent in listening to your questions and so on.
('68', 250, 5, 9, 459591) I have already received some questions from you and the President 2 has also raised some questions in the course of his speech.
('68', 250, 5, 10, 459719) I shall first reply to his questions.
('68', 250, 5, 11, 459757) If my reply raises any further questions in your minds, you are free to ask them.
('68', 250, 5, 12, 459839) The first question concerns the subsistence wages.
('68', 250, 5, 13, 459890) In my view we cannot formulate any exact rule about it.
('68', 250, 5, 14, 459946) We can no doubt say that we shall not go beyond a certain limit.
('68', 250, 5, 15, 460011) For instance, the Sangh has set the limit of Rs. 75 as monthly wage.
('68', 250, 5, 16, 460080) According to me even this is too much, because our field of activity is in the villages.
('68', 250, 5, 17, 460169) And we cannot allow Rs. 75 or Rs. 50 in the villages.
('68', 250, 5, 18, 460223) Nor is so much money needed there.
('68', 250, 5, 19, 460258) True, all people cannot go to the villages.
('68', 250, 5, 20, 460302) They have their own difficulties.
('68', 250, 5, 21, 460336) Then, there are some people who are good workers and whose ideas and actions are acceptable and whom we would not permit to leave the field of service.
('68', 250, 5, 22, 460488) And they cannot maintain themselves on low wages either.
('68', 250, 5, 23, 460545) To such people we can give even Rs. 75. But we give this reluctantly and they too accept it reluctantly.
('68', 250, 5, 24, 460650) This, however, is not a matter to be considered by others.
('68', 250, 5, 25, 460709) But, if one person can carry on with Rs. 5, why should he demand Rs. 50 Merely because some other parson is getting Rs. 50?
('68', 250, 5, 26, 460833) The person earning Rs. 50 or Rs. 75 has either poor health or has some other handicaps which the person earning Rs. 5 does not have.
('68', 250, 5, 27, 460966) This should not be considered a matter of competition at all.
('68', 250, 5, 28, 461028) Let a person take only what he needs.
('68', 250, 5, 29, 461066) For instance, Mirabehn can manage with very little.
('68', 250, 5, 30, 461118) But I told her that she should definitely take milk and fruits.
('68', 250, 5, 31, 461182) Because of this her monthly expense goes up to Rs. 10 or 15. But Gajanan who works in her place

('68', 251, 1, 2, 461388) in Sindi has such habits that he requires almost nothing compared to Mirabehn.
('68', 251, 1, 3, 461467) This does not make him envy Mirabehn.
('68', 251, 1, 4, 461505) And it should not make him envious.
('68', 251, 1, 5, 461541) Thus, no one should accept more than his minimum requirements.
('68', 251, 1, 6, 461604) Any person who has lived in a city so far and has now gone to a village but has not been able to adjust himself to village life may take higher wages for some time.
('68', 251, 1, 7, 461769) The next question deals with body labour.
('68', 251, 1, 8, 461811) What I have said earlier includes my reply on this point also.
('68', 251, 1, 9, 461874) Each person will function within his own individual limits.
('68', 251, 1, 10, 461934) We cannot lay down more than this.
('68', 251, 1, 11, 461969) Let every man put in the maximum body labour he can.
('68', 251, 1, 12, 462022) One worker wrote to me that he managed to earn his livelihood in the village; but all his time was spent in doing body labour.
('68', 251, 1, 13, 462149) He had resolved to take to spinning and also planned to make a living by spinning.
('68', 251, 1, 14, 462232) But he found no time to do anything else.
('68', 251, 1, 15, 462274) I have written to him that, if he continues his work with devotion, people will have a lesson to learn even from this.
('68', 251, 1, 16, 462393) If the people of the village desire to accept his services, he can educate their children, clean up the garbage and in return earn his bread from them.
('68', 251, 1, 17, 462545) If he puts his heart in his work, he will be able to earn his livelihood.
('68', 251, 1, 18, 462619) But he must take only what is necessary.
('68', 251, 1, 19, 462660) He may be able to have sweets, ghee, fruits, etc., if he asks for them.
('68', 251, 1, 20, 462732) But he should not accept these things even if the people offer them on their own.
('68', 251, 1, 21, 462814) I go round with the thought of the village in my mind, and so other problems do not arise for me.
('68', 251, 1, 22, 462912) There can be no question at all of drawing the maximum out of public funds.
('68', 251, 2, 23, 462988) PRESIDENT: What should be the lowest limit of body labour, so that, if a particular worker is not able to put in that much work, he would be justified [in withdrawing himself and thus] cease to be a drain on public funds?
('68', 251, 3, 24, 463210) GANDHIJI: I have understood your question.
('68', 251, 3, 25, 463253) But it is not possible to set the same limit for all workers.
('68', 251, 3, 26, 463315) In fact, each one of them should put in as much labour as he can.
('68', 251, 3, 27, 463381) Let him earn whatever wages he can, and supplement the deficit from the funds of the Sangh.
('68', 251, 3, 28, 463473) If his needs are not so great that it would be disturbing to others when they know about them, he should not hesitate to meet them from the Sangh.
('68', 251, 3, 29, 463620) I cannot set any limit.
('68', 251, 3, 30, 463644) I would not set any limit if the management were in my hands.
('68', 251, 3, 31, 463706) I do not also wish to determine which type of work should be regarded as body labour.
('68', 251, 3, 32, 463792) I can only say that writing a book is not body labour.
('68', 251, 3, 33, 463847) The third questiona very difficult onerelates to the family.
('68', 251, 3, 34, 463908) Members should help the President in solving this problem.
('68', 251, 3, 35, 463967) And the
('68', 252, 0, 1, 463975) VOL. 68 : 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 253
('68', 252, 1, 2, 464021) President also should be alert in the matter.
('68', 252, 1, 3, 464067) We have changed our way of life.
('68', 252, 1, 4, 464100) We have given up the old tradition.
('68', 252, 1, 5, 464136) Nevertheless, we are born in the cities.
('68', 252, 1, 6, 464177) We have got our parents, wives and children.
('68', 252, 1, 7, 464222) They have been all brought up in the old tradition.
('68', 252, 1, 8, 464274) They have not changed their way of living.
('68', 252, 1, 9, 464317) We wonder what right we have to compel them to accept the way of life we have accepted.
('68', 252, 1, 10, 464405) And we want to educate our children in the old method which we have discarded.
('68', 252, 1, 11, 464484) That is the reason why the workers are worried about the future of their children.
('68', 252, 1, 12, 464567) They wonder if they would be able to educate their children so as to make them lawyers or doctors.
('68', 252, 1, 13, 464666) On the one hand, a member of the Sangh lives in poverty and on the other he feels that his duty to his wife and children is different from what he has accepted for himself.
('68', 252, 1, 14, 464839) He believes that sacrifice is his dharma but not his family's.
('68', 252, 1, 15, 464902) Renunciation is regarded as a duty in old age.
('68', 252, 1, 16, 464949) At the root of this idea is the traditional Hindu sentiment that we should renounce the world in old age.
('68', 252, 1, 17, 465055) That is why we want to educate our children in the old way.
('68', 252, 1, 18, 465115) But we have given up the belief that renunciation is a duty only of old age, not imperative for youth.
('68', 252, 1, 19, 465218) We have accepted it as our duty, even in youth, to renounce all pleasures and serve the country.
('68', 252, 1, 20, 465315) If we believe that sacrifice is man's dharma and that our pleasures should be consistent with the dharma of renunciation, then it becomes our duty to recognize the appropriateness of this dharma for our wives and children as well.
('68', 252, 1, 21, 465546) If they insist on having more than this, let us tell them that we can give them only this much, that we can give them only the food that we ourselves eat; that what we consider proper for ourselves, we consider proper for them too.
('68', 252, 1, 22, 465778) What more could be done?
('68', 252, 1, 23, 465803) Right from my South Africa days I have adhered to this ideal.
('68', 252, 1, 24, 465865) There is nothing wrong in wanting to reduce one's income.
('68', 252, 1, 25, 465923) And any ideal which is right for us is also right for our children.
('68', 252, 1, 26, 465991) All problems would be easily solved if we acccept this.
('68', 252, 1, 27, 466047) But the conflict arises when we believe that our wives and children have a different dharma to follow.
('68', 252, 1, 28, 466150) We must go as far along this path as possible.
('68', 252, 1, 29, 466197) If, out of an impulse, we have gone too far, there should be no hesitation in retracing our steps.
('68', 252, 1, 30, 466296) The Sangh should carry on with whatever means it may be having.
('68', 252, 1, 31, 466360) Let us keep an eye on our resources and fix the maximum limit.
('68', 252, 1, 32, 466423) But, in doing this, we shall have to look to the country as well.
('68', 252, 1, 33, 466489) We are bound to be affected by whatever may be happening in the country.
('68', 252, 1, 34, 466562) And it is our goal to take the country along with us.
('68', 252, 1, 35, 466616) We must always try to pursue our activities taking the country with us.
('68', 252, 1, 36, 466688) I cannot lay down any rule in such matters.
('68', 252, 1, 37, 466732) These are matters concerning the individual and
('68', 253, 0, 1, 466780) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 254
('68', 253, 1, 2, 466822) they depend on his sincerity.
('68', 253, 1, 3, 466852) The highest limit of Rs. 75 has been set.
('68', 253, 1, 4, 466894) Whether or not that amount should be drawn is a matter for individual decision.
('68', 253, 2, 5, 466974) JAMNALALJI: But, from the point of view of an organization, it becomes necessary to make some rules.
('68', 253, 2, 6, 467075) It would not be a good rule that the organization should give what an individual considers proper to demand.
('68', 253, 2, 7, 467184) One who is engaged in public work should also think of one's market value.
('68', 253, 3, 8, 467259) G. I think from the public viewpoint it is difficult to clarify the matter any further.
('68', 253, 3, 9, 467347) A person's market value may be Rs. 25 merely because he knows only Marathi and Sanskrit and is ignorant of English.
('68', 253, 3, 10, 467463) But why should we put his value merely at Rs. 25?
('68', 253, 3, 11, 467513) Take the example of a woman spinner.
('68', 253, 3, 12, 467550) She would not earn even a pice in the market.
('68', 253, 3, 13, 467596) But we have decided to pay her three annas.
('68', 253, 3, 14, 467640) The question of market value arises in the case of a lawyer or a doctor.
('68', 253, 3, 15, 467713) He charges whatever fee he desires.
('68', 253, 3, 16, 467749) But we should not make such distinctions.
('68', 253, 3, 17, 467791) We may make some distinction if the lowness of one's wages is due to one's special quality.
('68', 253, 3, 18, 467883) For instance, if the needs of Gajanan are fewer than those of Mirabehn, he has no need to take as much as Mirabehn.
('68', 253, 3, 19, 467999) If a person who is a B.A. LL.B. and another with a knowledge of Marathi Sanskrit have similar functions to perform, they should be valued at the same rate.
('68', 253, 4, 20, 468155) J. But, if a person who can earn only Rs. 25 outside can get Rs. 40 from the Sangh, he would remain with the Sangh merely because of the temptation to get Rs. 40 even at the cost of degrading his soul.
('68', 253, 5, 21, 468357) G. That is correct.
('68', 253, 5, 22, 468377) But it depends on the firmness of the organizers of the Sangh; if there were any such person in the Sangh, they should convey it to him that he does not possess the abilities he was supposed to possess.
('68', 253, 5, 23, 468580) But take the example of Ravishankerbhai 1. He may not have any market value but he is a great worker.
('68', 253, 6, 24, 468682) J. What would be the correct policy with regard to the education of children and medical treatment?
('68', 253, 7, 25, 468782) G. The education of the boys certainly deserves our consideration.
('68', 253, 7, 26, 468849) I have already said that the dharma which is proper for us should also be considered proper for our families.
('68', 253, 7, 27, 468959) The children should not be converted to another dharma.
('68', 253, 7, 28, 469015) If I have considered it my dharma to maintain myself through body labour, it would be as good as converting my son to another dharma if I try to make him a

('68', 254, 1, 2, 469240) barrister.
('68', 254, 1, 3, 469251) I can only give him training in body labour.
('68', 254, 1, 4, 469296) Along with this, I should give my children whatever education I can within the income limits I have set for myself.
('68', 254, 1, 5, 469412) Let me now come to the point of medical treatment.
('68', 254, 1, 6, 469463) Take the example of Timmappa.
('68', 254, 1, 7, 469493) It is true that once we have gone to the villages, we should adjust our whole life accordingly.
('68', 254, 1, 8, 469589) But we must also look to the results of our experiments.
('68', 254, 1, 9, 469646) What was the result of Timmappa's not taking milk for a few days?
('68', 254, 1, 10, 469712) He had to spend on railway fare to go to Bombay.
('68', 254, 1, 11, 469761) He had to be under obligation to a doctor.
('68', 254, 1, 12, 469804) But even that was a mistake.
('68', 254, 1, 13, 469833) When we go to a village and live in poverty, we must avail ourselves only of such medical facilities as the poor villagers can command for maintaining their health.
('68', 254, 1, 14, 469998) Even if you tell me that I do not follow this precept myself, I cannot conceal my ideal, though I may accept the charge.
('68', 254, 1, 15, 470119) He who remains continuously ill should send in his resignation.
('68', 254, 2, 16, 470183) RAJENDRA BABU: Why do you stress so much the condition of the worker maintaining himself by body labour?
('68', 254, 2, 17, 470288) This would leave little time for service.
('68', 254, 2, 18, 470330) It may be all right to set an example to the people but setting an example is not enough.
('68', 254, 2, 19, 470420) The need for advice and consultation cannot be ruled out.
('68', 254, 2, 20, 470478) A worker's usefulness is very much reduced by overmuch insistence on physical labour.
('68', 254, 3, 21, 470564) G. This involves the question of reforming the entire indian society Every human being should maintain himself only through physical labour.
('68', 254, 3, 22, 470705) I consider it a divine law.
('68', 254, 3, 23, 470733) That is the reason why I have fixed that ideal.
('68', 254, 3, 24, 470781) Now, the question is about intellectual development Yes, it is a relevant question.
('68', 254, 3, 25, 470865) But, if I could have power over the world, I would make physical labour compulsory for everybody.
('68', 254, 3, 26, 470963) Exceptions would have to be made even here, for example,in favour of sannyasis and such others.
('68', 254, 3, 27, 471059) People would themselves make the means of livelihood available to them.
('68', 254, 3, 28, 471131) Whether you call it society or people or State, the meaning is the same.
('68', 254, 3, 29, 471204) I am not making any new or original point.
('68', 254, 3, 30, 471247) Ruskin, in his Unto This Last (translated by me as Sarvodaya 1) has said the same thing.
('68', 254, 3, 31, 471336) Our Shastras also stress the same point.
('68', 254, 3, 32, 471377) It may not be clearly mentioned, but it is there by implication.
('68', 254, 3, 33, 471442) I am not well versed in the Shastras.
('68', 254, 3, 34, 471480) Vinobaji and Kakasaheb can talk with authority citing references from the Shastras.
('68', 254, 3, 35, 471564) But I found the point clearly expounded in Unto This Last
('68', 254, 4, 36, 471622) 1 Vide Sarvodaya [ 1] ,16 5 1908; [II], 23 5 1908; [III], 30 5 1908; [IV], 6 6 1908; [V], 13 6 1908; [VI], 20 6 1908; [VII], 27 6 1908; [VIII], 4 7 1908; [IX], 18 7 1908.

('68', 255, 1, 2, 471835) and that very night I transformed my life.
('68', 255, 1, 3, 471878) The gist of Ruskin's argument is that a doctor or a lawyer should take the same wages as a labourer.
('68', 255, 2, 4, 471979) R. What should the present members do to pursue that ideal?
('68', 255, 3, 5, 472039) G. All the present members have this ideal before them.
('68', 255, 3, 6, 472095) But in the pursuit of that ideal they may follow some honest occupation or take their wages from the Sangh.
('68', 255, 3, 7, 472203) But the Sangh should give wages only to those whose services it values.
('68', 255, 3, 8, 472275) It should not give the wages as a favour.
('68', 255, 3, 9, 472317) The Sangh should not make anyone dependent on it.
('68', 255, 3, 10, 472367) This Sangh is not to produce parasites.
('68', 255, 3, 11, 472407) It may become dependent on them by taking the maximum work from them.
('68', 255, 4, 12, 472477) DEVSHARMAJI: Is not the limit of Rs. 75 too high?
('68', 255, 5, 13, 472527) G. All the better if it could be brought down.
('68', 255, 5, 14, 472574) As for me I have decided upon Rs. 15 as the limit.
('68', 255, 5, 15, 472625) you may lower it from Rs. 75 to Rs. 50 if you wish.
('68', 255, 5, 16, 472677) But it does not seem likely.

('68', 255, 8, 22, 472837) ANSARI, Having obtained some dispensation from medical friends, I am able to write this to you.
('68', 255, 8, 23, 472933) I hope to reach Delhi on 8th.
('68', 255, 8, 24, 472963) I hope you will prevent people from coming to the station.
('68', 255, 8, 25, 473022) I am not in a fit state to face crowds and cut my way through them.
('68', 255, 8, 26, 473090) I should love quietly to be taken to Birla's new Harijan Home.
('68', 255, 8, 27, 473153) This mustcouldhave been written by Mahadev.
('68', 255, 8, 28, 473197) I have taken up this letter to tell you that as soon as I received your great book 1 on regeneration, I began to read it and finished it the day following.
('68', 255, 8, 29, 473353) I have called it great because it is evidence of much research and great labour.
('68', 255, 8, 30, 473434) There is hardly a superfluous word in it.
('68', 255, 8, 31, 473476) But as I was reading it, I asked myself, Does this book take mankind upward?
('68', 255, 8, 32, 473553) Is it in need of that kind of regeneration?
('68', 255, 8, 33, 473597) What is revival of youth worth if you cannot be sure of persistent physical existence for two consecutive seconds?

('68', 256, 1, 4, 473852) I asked myself these questions, because you were the author of the book I have ever known you as a seeker of God.

('68', 256, 4, 9, 474193) March 3, 1936 DEAR FRIEND,
('68', 256, 5, 10, 474220) I thank you for your letter.
('68', 256, 5, 11, 474249) I attach no value to my son's letter of recantation, and if the job he has received is the price for his recantation, it is a premium put upon sin.
('68', 256, 5, 12, 474397) 1 As my son is continuously under the subtle influence of drink he has become incapable of coherent thinking or constancy to his words.
('68', 256, 5, 13, 474533) Nevertheless, if he is faithful in the performance of the job given to him, it is so much to the good.
('68', 256, 5, 14, 474636) I can only hope that he only appreciates the extraordinary kindness that has been shown to him by you and others and that he makes good use of the money he is receiving.

('68', 256, 10, 21, 474962) I got your letter this morning.
('68', 256, 10, 22, 474994) I read it immediately after having my meal, had a few rounds and am now writing this reply at 8.30. I tore up your letter soon after reading it.
('68', 256, 10, 23, 475139) What was so confidential init that you had to doubly reassure yourself?
('68', 256, 10, 24, 475211) Indeed, there was nothing private at all.

('68', 257, 1, 4, 475741) Your going has of course lessened my anxiety because the going meant following the law of truth, and not to go would have been, I feared, its violation.
('68', 257, 1, 5, 475894) But that had no relation to the blood Pressure, which had already been going down and so went down by itself.
('68', 257, 1, 6, 476004) I was not so much worried about your staying on, as I knew all the time that you would at last do the right thing only, and you did so quite promptly.
('68', 257, 1, 7, 476155) As for the blood pressure, however, things will go on as they have been going.
('68', 257, 1, 8, 476234) It had reached 188/110 at Wardha and once it went up to as high as 212/120, but the same day again it fell to 188/108. I don't know what it now is.
('68', 257, 1, 9, 476382) It cannot, therefore, be said at all that the blood pressure went down because of your going.
('68', 257, 1, 10, 476476) You may come when you can, after staying there as long as you have the duty to stay on.
('68', 257, 1, 11, 476564) Happiness ever goes with dharma.
('68', 257, 1, 12, 476597) And there alone lies peace of mind.
('68', 257, 1, 13, 476633) Never have any doubt that there can be no happiness in the violation of dharma.
('68', 257, 1, 14, 476713) Why do you want to be exempted from taking milk?
('68', 257, 1, 15, 476762) Your good lies only in taking it.
('68', 257, 1, 16, 476796) Of course, you have freedom to reduce its quantity when you cannot digest four lb.
('68', 257, 1, 17, 476879) There will be no difficulty in digesting four lb.
('68', 257, 1, 18, 476929) of milk as long as you have regular exercise and sleep.
('68', 257, 1, 19, 476985) As for fruit, take what is easily to be had.
('68', 257, 1, 20, 477030) It will be good if Jayaprakash follows the same diet as yours.
('68', 257, 1, 21, 477093) Keep your diary day after day.
('68', 257, 1, 22, 477124) I follow your point about studies.
('68', 257, 1, 23, 477159) You may do what you can.
('68', 257, 1, 24, 477184) Study Hindi grammar.
('68', 257, 1, 25, 477205) Send for anything you need from here.
('68', 257, 1, 26, 477243) I shall leave here on the 6th, hoping to reach Delhi on the 8th.
('68', 257, 1, 27, 477308) I shall be spending at least a fortnight there.
('68', 257, 1, 28, 477356) You must have written, I think, to Swaruprani and others about Kamala.
('68', 257, 1, 29, 477427) Ba is in Bombay, Rajaji, who has gone to Bombay, may perhaps come here.
('68', 257, 1, 30, 477499) We have a fairly good gathering here.
('68', 257, 1, 31, 477537) The weather is fair and they see that I get good peace and rest.
('68', 257, 1, 32, 477602) It seems one of your letters has been lost in transit.
('68', 257, 1, 33, 477657) I have noted that.
('68', 257, 1, 34, 477676) I know it is unlikely that you would avoid writing out of laziness.
('68', 257, 1, 35, 477744) The fear is you might grow melancholy, but you ought not to under any circumstances.
('68', 257, 1, 36, 477829) Doesn't Mother Gita teach us to endure cheerfully the situation that we happen to be in?
('68', 257, 2, 37, 477918) Blessings from BAPU

('68', 258, 1, 2, 478028) 330. SPEECH AT GANDHI SEVA SANGH MEETINGIII
('68', 258, 2, 3, 478072) SAVLI, March 3, 1936
('68', 258, 3, 4, 478093) Ramnarayanji 1 has passed on a letter to the President.
('68', 258, 3, 5, 478149) He showed it to me, and I read it too.
('68', 258, 3, 6, 478188) Then I wished to know what this committee 2
('68', 258, 4, 7, 478232) for Gandhian thought was, who were the persons constituting it, what were its powers and so on.
('68', 258, 4, 8, 478328) Then I was informed about all that happened yesterday.
('68', 258, 4, 9, 478383) I was told at the same time that this committee was not a body authorized by this session.
('68', 258, 4, 10, 478474) This session does not function by passing resolutions.
('68', 258, 4, 11, 478529) When the occasion arose, a suggestion was made, and then those who favoured the suggestion formed a committee.
('68', 258, 4, 12, 478640) At first I felt that I should not involve myself in this matter.
('68', 258, 4, 13, 478705) I felt also that since I had not been able to be present at the discussion, I was not entitled to express any opinion.
('68', 258, 4, 14, 478824) Nevertheless, I do have an opinion on the subject and I consider it my duty to express it even if it should be considered an impertinence on my part.
('68', 258, 4, 15, 478974) I wish to make clear to the committee its scope.
('68', 258, 4, 16, 479023) If it undertakes any work, it should only be one of collecting my thoughts and beliefs.
('68', 258, 4, 17, 479111) If it does anything more, I am afraid the misgivings 3 expressed by Ramnarayanji are bound to come true.
('68', 258, 4, 18, 479216) I have conceived no such thing as Gandhism.
('68', 258, 4, 19, 479260) I am not an exponent of any sect.
('68', 258, 4, 20, 479294) I never claimed to have originated any philosophy.
('68', 258, 4, 21, 479345) Nor am I endeavoring to do so.
('68', 258, 4, 22, 479376) Several people said to me
('68', 258, 5, 23, 479402) 1 Ramnarayan Chowdhary 2 It was proposed that a committee for Gandhian thought be formed with D. B. Kalelkar, as President and the following members: Shankar Tryambak Dharmadhikari, Mahadev Desai, Swami Anand, Kishorelal Mashruwala, Rangarao R. Diwakar, Haribhau Upadhyaya, Balubhai Mehta, Devsharma 'Abhay', Rajendra Prasad, Shankarrao Deo, Raghunath Shridhar Dhotre, Satis Chandra Das Gupta and Sitaram Purushottam Patwardhan.
('68', 258, 5, 24, 479831) 3 Namely: (1) Gandhism would end up by becoming one more sect.
('68', 258, 5, 25, 479894) (2) It would give rise to more blind faith and intellectual dependence.
('68', 258, 5, 26, 479966) (3) Differences would crop up among the Gandhians themselves with regard to the interpretation of Gandhian thought.
('68', 258, 5, 27, 480082) (4) The importance of practice would decrease and undue importance would come to be attached to mere thought.
('68', 258, 5, 28, 480192) (5) The evolution of Gandhian thought would slacken.
('68', 258, 5, 29, 480245) (6) Gandhism would assume the form of a dogma and breed hypocrisy.
('68', 258, 5, 30, 480312) (7) The bad habit of reading and writing will grow and inclination to do service would go down.
('68', 258, 5, 31, 480408) (8) It would also increase Gandhiji's difficulty in giving decisions on doubtful points.
('68', 259, 0, 1, 480497) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 260
('68', 259, 1, 2, 480539) that I should write a smriti 1 of Gandhian thought.
('68', 259, 1, 3, 480591) I told them that I could not presume to vie with the ancient law givers.
('68', 259, 1, 4, 480664) I have no such plans.
('68', 259, 1, 5, 480686) The right to codify my thoughts cannot belong to me.
('68', 259, 1, 6, 480739) Whatever is lasting will take shape after I am gone.
('68', 259, 1, 7, 480792) Without any elaborate scheme I have simply tried in my own way to apply the eternal Principles of truth and non violence to our daily life and problems.
('68', 259, 1, 8, 480945) Like a child I did whatever occurred to me on the spur of the moment during the course of events.
('68', 259, 1, 9, 481043) Then I realized that what I was doing were experiments in truth.
('68', 259, 1, 10, 481108) In doing so I have sometimes erred and learnt by my errors.
('68', 259, 1, 11, 481168) Life has thus become for me a series of experiments in truth.
('68', 259, 1, 12, 481230) In my pursuit of truth I came across the method of non violence.
('68', 259, 1, 13, 481295) By instinct I have been a votary of truth, but not non violent.
('68', 259, 1, 14, 481359) As the Muni Jinavijayaji once rightly observed, I was all for truth and was capable of sacrificing non violence for the sake of truth.
('68', 259, 1, 15, 481494) I confessed to him that it was true.
('68', 259, 1, 16, 481531) For me there was no dharma higher than truth and no dharma higher than the supreme duty of non violence. 2 The word dharma in my opinion has different connotations as used in the two statements.
('68', 259, 1, 17, 481726) In other words it means that there cannot be an ideal higher then truth and there cannot be any duty higher than non violence.
('68', 259, 1, 18, 481853) A man can pursue truth only by constantly adhering to this duty.
('68', 259, 1, 19, 481918) There is no other means for the pursuit of truth.
('68', 259, 1, 20, 481968) For the sake of truth one should not hesitate even to witness the ruin of one's country.
('68', 259, 1, 21, 482057) One may even leave one's country.
('68', 259, 1, 22, 482091) Paul Richard has severely criticized me in this regard.
('68', 259, 1, 23, 482147) He had pointed out the difference between my ideas and those of Manusmriti.
('68', 259, 1, 24, 482223) I do not regard it as dharma to have to resort to untruth either for the sake of argument or to protect the cow.
('68', 259, 1, 25, 482336) This statement is correct.
('68', 259, 1, 26, 482363) However, I do not think this is a subject which can be discussed academically.
('68', 259, 1, 27, 482442) Well, all my philosophy, if it may be called by that pretentious name, is contained in what I have said.
('68', 259, 1, 28, 482547) You will not call it Gandhism; there is no ism about it.
('68', 259, 1, 29, 482604) And no elaborate literature is needed about it.
('68', 259, 1, 30, 482652) All that I have written is but a description of whatever I have done.
('68', 259, 1, 31, 482722) And my actions alone are the greatest exposition of truth and non violence.
('68', 259, 1, 32, 482798) Those who believe in these can propagate them only by following them in practice.
('68', 259, 1, 33, 482880) They call for no books.
('68', 259, 1, 34, 482904) My work is there for them to emulate.
('68', 259, 1, 35, 482942) But it may be said that this, too, is not permanent.
('68', 259, 2, 36, 482995) 1 Code 2 Mahabharata, Adiparvan, XI.
('68', 259, 2, 37, 483032) 13 and Shantiparvan, CLXII.
('68', 260, 0, 1, 483060) VOL. 68 : 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 261
('68', 260, 1, 2, 483106) A caustic critic once observed that the spinning wheel would be so discredited that when I died the wheels would serve to make the funeral pyre.
('68', 260, 1, 3, 483251) That, however, has not shaken my faith in the spinning wheel.
('68', 260, 1, 4, 483313) I will not despair even if you all forsook me.
('68', 260, 1, 5, 483360) My faith will grow all the more.
('68', 260, 1, 6, 483393) Indeed, I have never despaired nor have I had to repent.
('68', 260, 1, 7, 483450) I do not regret the long struggle that I have put up nor the amount of money and the number of lives lost.
('68', 260, 1, 8, 483557) Whenever I went to the villages I have returned with my vessel full of hope.
('68', 260, 1, 9, 483634) But how can I convince the world that one cannot communicate this confidence with the help of books?
('68', 260, 1, 10, 483735) Silent work alone can provide it.
('68', 260, 1, 11, 483769) Hence no one should yield to the weakness that he would be helpless if the committee did not supply literature.
('68', 260, 1, 12, 483881) The workers complain that pundits from the government and other circles go to the villagers and criticize our ideas.
('68', 260, 1, 13, 483998) They misguide the people.
('68', 260, 1, 14, 484024) What can we do, then, since we do not have their superior knowledge?
('68', 260, 2, 15, 484093) It is a real difficulty.
('68', 260, 2, 16, 484118) But where is the need for books?
('68', 260, 2, 17, 484151) Tell the villagers that you are there in their midst to serve them with your wheels, your brooms and buckets.
('68', 260, 2, 18, 484261) Let them accept your service if they will.
('68', 260, 2, 19, 484304) Must we then, you will ask, work away in silence, without bothering about our critics?
('68', 260, 2, 20, 484391) Yes; I should not mind even your taking a vow of silence.
('68', 260, 2, 21, 484449) Write if you feel you cannot do without it.
('68', 260, 2, 22, 484493) But let not your real work suffer because you are busy writing books.
('68', 260, 3, 23, 484563) This, however, is the ideal.
('68', 260, 3, 24, 484592) This committee was not so imperative.
('68', 260, 3, 25, 484630) But now that it has come into being it will not be inconsistent with our work.
('68', 260, 3, 26, 484709) There are no grounds for Ramnarayanji's misgivings.
('68', 260, 3, 27, 484761) All we need is a little vigilance.
('68', 260, 3, 28, 484796) I can understand your desire for some authoritative publications explaining the things we are striving to do.
('68', 260, 3, 29, 484906) These you may have without entering into a controversy.
('68', 260, 3, 30, 484962) The committee should function quietly without much ado.
('68', 260, 3, 31, 485018) It will only spread poison, if it sets about to work with pomp and show.
('68', 260, 3, 32, 485091) And of course it shall have to be self supporting.
('68', 260, 3, 33, 485142) I should be satisfied if your Sangh became a register of workers who have complete faith in all activities which are a concrete expression of truth and non violence, or rather simply of non violence (for the practice of non violence is impossible without acceptance of truth).
('68', 260, 3, 34, 485419) Thus let no member say that he believes in truth and non violence, but does not believe in handicrafts or khadi and service of the villagers therethrough, or that he believes in truth and
('68', 261, 0, 1, 485607) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 262
('68', 261, 1, 2, 485649) non violence but does not believe in Hindu Muslim unity, or in the removal of untouchability.
('68', 261, 1, 3, 485743) If your meet such a one you may tell him that it is possible that he is a believer in truth and non violence according to his own conception, but not according to Gandhiji's conception of them, and that he cannot therefore be a member of the Sangh.
('68', 261, 1, 4, 485992) Beyond this, your Sangh has no credal, regional or institutional limitations.
('68', 261, 1, 5, 486070) Your members may belong to any caste or creed, any race or nation.
('68', 261, 1, 6, 486137) I agree with the President regarding this.
('68', 261, 2, 7, 486180) There is no need to repeat that everyone should follow the ideal of celibacy.
('68', 261, 2, 8, 486258) Of course it is not possible to ride two horses at a time.
('68', 261, 2, 9, 486317) Those who are not married or, though married, are living like unmarried ones can serve better.
('68', 261, 2, 10, 486412) But it is no possible to have a rigid rule regarding this.
('68', 261, 2, 11, 486471) Moreover, there is no need for it.
('68', 261, 2, 12, 486506) It is good if we get workers who do not wish to marry but if tomorrow Gajanan or Surendra wants to get married, he can do so and still remain a member of the Sangh.
('68', 261, 2, 13, 486671) If their expenses increase they can take them from the Sangh.
('68', 261, 2, 14, 486733) It is a personal question.
('68', 261, 2, 15, 486760) Hypocrisy and unchastity will creep in if we form a rule for it.
('68', 261, 3, 16, 486825) Some of the shortcomings shown by the President are shortcomings of the whole of India.
('68', 261, 3, 17, 486913) It is necessary for us to be alert about them.
('68', 261, 3, 18, 486960) Those who are worshippers of truth and non violence and want to serve India and humanity cannot afford to be lazy.
('68', 261, 3, 19, 487075) Those who waste time waste truth, non violence and service as well.
('68', 261, 3, 20, 487143) This applies to cleanliness, too.
('68', 261, 3, 21, 487177) If we are alert, do not waste time and observe cleanliness, we will not be lacking in knowledge.
('68', 261, 3, 22, 487274) What we call lack of knowledge is actually lack of concentration.
('68', 261, 3, 23, 487340) Mother Gita says that one who worships with faith will automatically gain knowledge.
('68', 261, 4, 24, 487425) The President has shown three angles.
('68', 261, 4, 25, 487463) 3 Possession is really mental.
('68', 261, 4, 26, 487494) I have a watch, a rope and an undergarment.
('68', 261, 4, 27, 487538) I am possessive,
('68', 261, 5, 28, 487555) 1 Kishorelal Mashruwala had said that the Sangh would comprise workers who would help the various institutions in times of need.
('68', 261, 5, 29, 487684) It would propagate Gandhiji's principles and would be ready to form a band of worker for a good cause.
('68', 261, 5, 30, 487787) It would be a trustee of the property of the various institutions.
('68', 261, 5, 31, 487854) 2 Bhagavad Gita, IV.
('68', 261, 5, 32, 487875) 39. 3 The President had suggested that a limit should be fixed regarding (1) the amount of balance an institution may have at the end of a year; (2) donations it may receive and (3) the property of worker may acquire in the name of the institution.
('68', 262, 0, 1, 488124) VOL. 68 : 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 263
('68', 262, 1, 2, 488170) if I feel unhappy without them.
('68', 262, 1, 3, 488202) A person can keep a large blanket if he needs one; if he is not distressed when it is lost he is not possessive.
('68', 262, 2, 4, 488315) What the President has said 1 is enough.
('68', 262, 2, 5, 488356) There is no need to say more.
('68', 262, 3, 6, 488386) I see that there is a tendency to believe that these programmes are mutually exclusive or antagonistic.
('68', 262, 3, 7, 488490) Much of our misunderstanding arises out of this belief.
('68', 262, 3, 8, 488546) The worker in the constructive field looks down upon the political programme and vice versa.
('68', 262, 3, 9, 488639) But really there is no such opposition.
('68', 262, 3, 10, 488679) I had thought that it was clear by now to every worker that there was no absolute division between the so called political and the so called constructive programmes.
('68', 262, 3, 11, 488845) In our method of work there are no watertight compartments.
('68', 262, 3, 12, 488905) Nevertheless I do maintain that for the sake of efficiency it is necessary for one to confine oneself to one item at a time or such items as conveniently run together.
('68', 262, 3, 13, 489073) The governor of the Bank of England exercises considerable influence on the politics of England, but he never busies himself with what are called active politics.
('68', 262, 3, 14, 489236) He has hardly the time to follow the debates in the House of Commons.
('68', 262, 3, 15, 489306) But he is at least as important a member in the English public life as, say, a noted member of the House of Commons.
('68', 262, 3, 16, 489423) As a general rule I would suggest that the members of the Sangh should occupy themselves with work which brings no kudos and which is ordinarily not liked by workers.
('68', 262, 4, 17, 489590) We have different programmes, such as the Spinners' Association, the Harijan sevak Sangh, the Village Industries Association and goseva, which I have not yet placed before you.
('68', 262, 4, 18, 489767) But one connected with goseva can also become a member of the Sangh.
('68', 262, 4, 19, 489836) Those who wish may even take part in more than one activity.
('68', 262, 4, 20, 489897) It is a matter of one's capacity.
('68', 262, 4, 21, 489931) As for me, I can attend to other things even as I work for the Charkha Sangh Everybody cannot do the same.
('68', 262, 4, 22, 490038) For example, take the Parliamentary Board 3. Even this I have brought into being.
('68', 262, 4, 23, 490120) But would I ever join it?
('68', 262, 4, 24, 490146) Today I cannot even think of entering the Legislatures.
('68', 262, 4, 25, 490202) However, it is not a matter of principle.
('68', 262, 4, 26, 490244) We must do whatever may be necessary at a given time.
('68', 262, 4, 27, 490298) And tomorrow, if I deem it
('68', 262, 5, 28, 490325) 1 That a satyagrahi should be firm about one thing: He should consider it his duty to help the oppressed and raise them, make them full of life and spirit.
('68', 262, 5, 29, 490481) He should resist untruth under any circumstances in spite of his superior's anger.
('68', 262, 5, 30, 490564) 2 Mahadev Desai here reports: One of the questions .
('68', 262, 5, 31, 490617) was about the compatibility or otherwise of the contructive with the political programme. 3 Formed in May 1934, with M.A. Ansari as President
('68', 263, 0, 1, 490759) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 264
('68', 263, 1, 2, 490801) my duty to go to the Legislature, I may very well do it.
('68', 263, 1, 3, 490858) It was I who started the civil disobedience movement.
('68', 263, 1, 4, 490912) But I instructed the Hindi propaganda workers in South India that they should not court imprisonment, as the work would suffer.
('68', 263, 1, 5, 491040) Only Anna (Shri Harihar Sharma) from among them went to jail and that, too, with my permission.
('68', 263, 1, 6, 491136) I had told Shankerlal [Banker] that the work of the Spinners' Association was as valuable as courting of imprisonment by thousands of men.
('68', 263, 1, 7, 491275) Except for a few days in the beginning, jail going became another name for taking rest.
('68', 263, 1, 8, 491363) Those who remained outside faced a number of hardships and those who had gone to jail returned strong and sturdy.
('68', 263, 1, 9, 491477) Once they went in, they violently defied the jail rules.
('68', 263, 1, 10, 491534) What good did such people do by going to jail?
('68', 263, 1, 11, 491581) It is a mistake to make a distinction between the constructive and the political programmes.
('68', 263, 1, 12, 491674) In my opinion, political work also is constructive work.
('68', 263, 1, 13, 491731) I once wrote in Young India that even civil disobedience was constructive work according to me.
('68', 263, 1, 14, 491827) But from the point of view of the world, it may be described as destructive.
('68', 263, 1, 15, 491904) In reality, they are two branches of satyagraha, and hence are akin.
('68', 263, 1, 16, 491973) One cannot be complete without the other.
('68', 263, 1, 17, 492015) But some people wonder how goseva, removal of untouchability or propagation of Hindi could be called political activities.
('68', 263, 1, 18, 492138) Would these things bring swaraj?
('68', 263, 1, 19, 492171) But it is my belief that swaraj cannot be attained without these.
('68', 263, 1, 20, 492237) Many Congressmen, too, do not have faith in them.
('68', 263, 1, 21, 492287) It is also our task to inspire such faith in them.
('68', 263, 1, 22, 492338) These people do not consider these activities political.
('68', 263, 1, 23, 492395) Hence, they describe them as constructive.
('68', 263, 1, 24, 492438) A large number of people are ready to take to activities which they regard as political.
('68', 263, 1, 25, 492527) Hence, we must consciously abide by a particular rule.The whole thing will break down if we do not observe the rule.
('68', 263, 1, 26, 492644) That is the reason why the work is going on well in Gujarat.
('68', 263, 1, 27, 492705) Today we have imperfect faith in these things.
('68', 263, 1, 28, 492752) The plant is tender.
('68', 263, 1, 29, 492773) We have to tend it with great care.
('68', 263, 1, 30, 492809) It is my belief that if we could do these four or five things well, swaraj is as good as in our hands.
('68', 263, 1, 31, 492912) It would also increase our efficiency.
('68', 263, 1, 32, 492951) I am reminded of an incident.
('68', 263, 1, 33, 492981) There was some discussion about the constructive programme at a meeting.
('68', 263, 1, 34, 493054) Sapru 1, Chintamani 2 and Pal 3
('68', 263, 2, 35, 493086) were also present there.
('68', 263, 2, 36, 493111) Chintamani was very critical of the constructive programme.
('68', 263, 2, 37, 493171) Pal replied to him.
('68', 263, 2, 38, 493191) He was considered my

('68', 264, 1, 2, 493311) opponent; but his sharp intellect grasped the thing.
('68', 264, 1, 3, 493364) Of language he was a master.
('68', 264, 1, 4, 493393) He explained, much better than I could have done, that with it the prestige of the country would go up.
('68', 264, 1, 5, 493497) He said we had come across something which would give us the strength that we would not derive from all our other works and all the journals.
('68', 264, 1, 6, 493639) What he expressed in a beautiful language I conveyed in my uncouth language.
('68', 264, 1, 7, 493716) My faith in the constructive programme is probably ten times it was then.
('68', 264, 1, 8, 493790) The work of the Parliamentary Board is also my creation.
('68', 264, 1, 9, 493847) But, if you wish to go to the Legislatures for this reason, I shall not allow you to do so.
('68', 264, 1, 10, 493939) Today, I shall send Bhulabhai 1 there.
('68', 264, 1, 11, 493978) He has faith in that work and he is also capable.
('68', 264, 1, 12, 494028) What would I do with Satyamurti 2 here?
('68', 264, 1, 13, 494068) If I have to attain swaraj through music, I would send Khareshastri 3 or Balkoba.
('68', 264, 1, 14, 494150) And, if your faith in the constructive programme is deep enough, you must do only that work.
('68', 264, 1, 15, 494243) Such is my faith in goseva.
('68', 264, 1, 16, 494271) I even dream of the cow.
('68', 264, 1, 17, 494296) Let us all concentrate on our own work and our own place.
('68', 264, 1, 18, 494354) Let that be our dharma.
('68', 264, 1, 19, 494378) And even if another's dharma appears to be best we should understand that it is fraught with danger.

('68', 264, 4, 22, 494553) 331. SPEECH AT GANDHI SEVA SANGH MEETINGIV
('68', 264, 5, 23, 494596) SAVLI, March 4, 1936 Before replying to the questions 4 I wish to say a few things on my own.
('68', 264, 5, 24, 494690) I have of course no right to say anything.
('68', 264, 5, 25, 494733) But it is my habit to express my opinion on whatever I hear.
('68', 264, 5, 26, 494794) I am no doubt very eager to listen to your discussion.
('68', 264, 5, 27, 494849) But I have held back my eagerness.
('68', 264, 5, 28, 494884) Even so, things are conveyed to me by jailor (the Sardar), sometimes light heartedly and sometimes solemnly.
('68', 264, 5, 29, 494993) Why have we all gathered here?
('68', 264, 5, 30, 495024) Why are we wasting our time?
('68', 264, 5, 31, 495053) I hear that votes were taken on the question of the wages for the members of the Sangh.
('68', 264, 5, 32, 495141) Four hours were spent in unnecessary arguments over it, although it was self evident.
('68', 264, 5, 33, 495227) Where was the need to argue about it?
('68', 264, 5, 34, 495265) Jamnalalji raised the question,
('68', 264, 6, 35, 495297) 1 Bhulabhai J. Desai 2 S. Satyamurti 3 Narayan Moreshwar Khare 4 Raised by Jamnalal Bajaj
('68', 265, 0, 1, 495387) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 266
('68', 265, 1, 2, 495429) because he has to find the money.
('68', 265, 1, 3, 495463) But we must tell him that we do not expect wages.
('68', 265, 1, 4, 495513) I do not know what Gandhism is.
('68', 265, 1, 5, 495545) But I do not know the Gandhian teaching.
('68', 265, 1, 6, 495586) Let us try to carry on our work without money.
('68', 265, 1, 7, 495633) Where there is non violence, not even a cowrie is needed.
('68', 265, 1, 8, 495691) Yes, I was telling you that we are arguing without a concrete resolution.
('68', 265, 1, 9, 495765) Even this would be all right in a way.
('68', 265, 1, 10, 495804) Everyone is engrossed in his own work.
('68', 265, 1, 11, 495843) Where is the need for a resolution?
('68', 265, 1, 12, 495879) Even so, some resolutions can be necessary.
('68', 265, 1, 13, 495923) I cannot say what these resolutions should be as I am not able to fully participate in the session.
('68', 265, 1, 14, 496023) If you cannot think of any resolutions and if there are going to be just arguments, do stop the exercise at once.
('68', 265, 1, 15, 496137) Or, let some definite programme be formulated.
('68', 265, 1, 16, 496184) Let something or the other be achieved here.
('68', 265, 1, 17, 496229) Put back the money that has been spent here.
('68', 265, 1, 18, 496274) Observe Savli very closely.
('68', 265, 1, 19, 496302) So many of us who are workers have gathered here and if we do nothing for Savli, it would be a very harsh comment on the session.
('68', 265, 1, 20, 496432) Mahadev is much pained by this thought.
('68', 265, 1, 21, 496472) The sad condition as in Savli is to be found everywherethere is dirt, there is the problem of water, there are quarrels.
('68', 265, 1, 22, 496593) Let us do our utmost to remedy these things.
('68', 265, 1, 23, 496638) There was a suggestion that there should be an eight hour spinning programme one day.
('68', 265, 1, 24, 496724) But it was voted out.
('68', 265, 1, 25, 496746) The pretext was the difficulty about obtaining so many charkhas.
('68', 265, 1, 26, 496811) If so many charkhas were not available, we could have carried on with half the number?
('68', 265, 1, 27, 496898) Some could have done carding, while others did the spinning.
('68', 265, 1, 28, 496959) But leaving aside the charkhas, let us at least clean up the filth in the village.
('68', 265, 1, 29, 497042) I am reminded of Balasore.
('68', 265, 1, 30, 497069) The Sanitary Inspector of the town said that, if only he could have 50 men, the local tank could be cleaned.
('68', 265, 1, 31, 497178) I appealed to the people and 50 men volunteered.
('68', 265, 1, 32, 497227) Many such tasks are waiting to be done in Savli.
('68', 265, 1, 33, 497276) You can take up some such work.
('68', 265, 1, 34, 497308) You have spent Rs. 4,000 on the session.
('68', 265, 1, 35, 497349) Do some work here worth Rs. 4,000. We have long passed the age of resolutions.
('68', 265, 1, 36, 497428) So, what new outlook will you take back with you from this session?
('68', 265, 1, 37, 497496) The most difficult question is the one of village industries.
('68', 265, 1, 38, 497558) Then there is the question of health.
('68', 265, 1, 39, 497596) Yes, let us not talk about the debts of the villagers.
('68', 265, 1, 40, 497651) Let us not take up that burden.
('68', 265, 1, 41, 497683) But let us at least improve their health.
('68', 265, 1, 42, 497725) That, too, is the business of the Congress.
('68', 265, 1, 43, 497769) But now it is getting late.
('68', 265, 1, 44, 497797) So I leave this subject here, and come to the other questions.
('68', 265, 2, 45, 497860) Q. How can lifelong interest in work be developed among the workers?
('68', 266, 0, 1, 497929) VOL. 68 : 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 267
('68', 266, 1, 2, 497975) A. The Gita has furnished the answer: through constant practice.
('68', 266, 2, 3, 498040) Q. Can person who has taken the vow of non possession become a trustee
('68', 266, 3, 4, 498111) A Yes, he can.
('68', 266, 3, 5, 498126) There can be no objection to this on principle.
('68', 266, 3, 6, 498174) If I have given a different opinion in the case of Vinobaji, there must have been a personal reason.
('68', 266, 4, 7, 498275) Q. What is your view about the position Dr. Ambedkar has taken?
('68', 266, 5, 8, 498339) A. Had I been in Dr. Ambedkr's place, I would have been as angry.
('68', 266, 5, 9, 498405) In his position, may be, I would not have been a believer in non violence.
('68', 266, 5, 10, 498480) When overcome by anger, a person does whatever comes to his mind.
('68', 266, 5, 11, 498546) Whatever Dr. Ambedkar does, we must bear it in all humility.
('68', 266, 5, 12, 498607) Not only that, it would be a service to Harijans.
('68', 266, 5, 13, 498657) If he really hits us with shoes, we must bear even that.
('68', 266, 5, 14, 498714) But we should not be afraid of him.
('68', 266, 5, 15, 498750) There is no need to kiss Dr. Ambedkar's feet to convince him.
('68', 266, 5, 16, 498812) That would be a disservice.
('68', 266, 5, 17, 498840) If he and the othr Harijans who have no faith in Hinduism embrace another religion, that too would make for our expiation.
('68', 266, 5, 18, 498963) We deserve such treatment.
('68', 266, 5, 19, 498990) Our task [now] is to wake up to the situation and purify ourselves.
('68', 266, 5, 20, 499058) There is no need for flattery.
('68', 266, 5, 21, 499089) That is why I expressed my sorrow at his announcement and suggested self purification.
('68', 266, 5, 22, 499176) I did nothing more.
('68', 266, 6, 23, 499196) Q. What are the points of similarity and difference between your point of view and socialism?
('68', 266, 7, 24, 499290) A. There are quite a few similarities.
('68', 266, 7, 25, 499329) I too desire that everything should be considered as belonging to God.
('68', 266, 7, 26, 499400) I too believe that all wealth belongs to the people.
('68', 266, 7, 27, 499453) But the difference lies in that the socialists advocate collective effort, whereas I believe that the beginning should be made at once in our individual conduct.
('68', 266, 7, 28, 499615) If we have such faith, we should dedicate to society at least our own property.
('68', 266, 7, 29, 499695) One cannot be a socialist so long as one retains even a cowrie for oneself.
('68', 266, 7, 30, 499771) They want to achieve their aim through legislation.
('68', 266, 7, 31, 499823) Legislation implies coercion.
('68', 266, 7, 32, 499853) If they are not saying all these things now, it is because that is not within their power.
('68', 266, 7, 33, 499944) They are virtuous because they are weak.
('68', 266, 7, 34, 499985) Socialists, that is Communists, want to use force, but they are helpless.
('68', 266, 7, 35, 500059) But we are believers in democracy.
('68', 266, 8, 36, 500094) 1 Bhagavad Gita, VI.
('68', 266, 8, 37, 500115) 35 2 This was in reply to a doubt expressed by a member.
('68', 267, 0, 1, 500172) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 268
('68', 267, 1, 2, 500214) Q. What is the difference between your views and those of Pt. Jawaharlalji?
('68', 267, 2, 3, 500290) A. We have many differences, and they are well known too.
('68', 267, 2, 4, 500348) The position as revealed in our correspondence still remains.
('68', 267, 2, 5, 500410) 1 But in spite of our differences we respect each other and desire to work together as far as possible.
('68', 267, 3, 6, 500514) Q. What should be the limits of the worker's individual service?
('68', 267, 4, 7, 500579) A. A very fine criterion for this is to be found in the sloka 2
('68', 267, 5, 8, 500643) which lays down that for the good of the family the individual may be sacrificed.
('68', 267, 5, 9, 500725) An individual may be served only as far as it does not hamper service of the society.
('68', 267, 5, 10, 500811) Suppose that my son is ill, my mother is ill, or my wife is ill, but I am expected to preside over a meeting at Lucknow.
('68', 267, 5, 11, 500932) In such a situation, I would leave my son, mother and wife in charge of my brother, etc., and go.
('68', 267, 6, 12, 501030) Q. Can people who believe in non violence take unfertilized eggs?
('68', 267, 7, 13, 501096) A. It is a personal matter.
('68', 267, 7, 14, 501124) Those who have no objection can take such eggs.
('68', 267, 7, 15, 501172) The reason why we should take a neutral attitude on this point is that these days the Hindus' definition of non violence is confined to the matter of food.
('68', 267, 7, 16, 501328) I have regarded it as of secondary importance.
('68', 267, 7, 17, 501375) If you say that we have to do it in order to live, well, strictly speaking, it would be an act of violence to eat even a single morsel.
('68', 267, 7, 18, 501511) In such things we can have no rules which would be equally applicable to all.
('68', 267, 7, 19, 501589) I have myself given cod liver oil to some boys in the Ashram.
('68', 267, 7, 20, 501651) Doctors frequently prescribe alcohol and meat.
('68', 267, 7, 21, 501698) They have even started prescribing glands.
('68', 267, 7, 22, 501741) If anybody objects, the Doctors cite the authority of Manu and do not hesitate to tell a lie to save the life of a patient.
('68', 267, 7, 23, 501865) Throughout the world only a section of Hindus has restrictions about non vegetarian food on religious grounds.
('68', 267, 7, 24, 501976) And these are confined to some Vaishyas, Jains and a few Brahmins.
('68', 267, 7, 25, 502043) Shall we then abandon the Muslims, Parsis, etc.?
('68', 267, 7, 26, 502092) I have seen many non vegetarians who believe in non violence and many vegetarians who believe in violence.
('68', 267, 7, 27, 502199) Some abstain from non vegetarian food because
('68', 267, 8, 28, 502245) 1 Vide Letter to Jawaharlal Nehru, 14 9 1933 and Appendix Letter from Jawaharlal Nehru, 13 9 1933. 2 Which says: One should sacrifice the individual for the sake of the family, the family for the village and the village for the country; for the sake of atman one should sacrifice the whole world.

('68', 268, 1, 2, 502588) they do not relish it; it is not in their upbringing.
('68', 268, 1, 3, 502642) When I took meat out of a sense of duty, I had a bad time of it.
('68', 268, 1, 4, 502707) Let not the vegetarians feel proud.
('68', 268, 1, 5, 502743) Non violence is a unique thing.
('68', 268, 1, 6, 502775) It is a matter of feeling, not merely of external behaviour.
('68', 268, 2, 7, 502836) Q. What should be done to check the increase in births among poor women?
('68', 268, 3, 8, 502909) A. Our duty is to explain to them the duty of self control.
('68', 268, 3, 9, 502969) Artificial measures would be as good as death.
('68', 268, 3, 10, 503016) And I do not think the village women will take to these measures.
('68', 268, 3, 11, 503082) Why, Premabehn herself is a maiden with a mind completely free from passion.
('68', 268, 3, 12, 503159) On her own she is a votary of brahmacharya.
('68', 268, 3, 13, 503203) She should work with this faith.
('68', 268, 3, 14, 503236) Women like her will have quite an impact.
('68', 268, 3, 15, 503278) We must try to get milk for the village children.
('68', 268, 4, 16, 503328) Q. Women may be willing to exercise restraint to keep births in check.
('68', 268, 4, 17, 503399) But what should be done if men use force?
('68', 268, 5, 18, 503441) A. This is a question of a women's true dharma.
('68', 268, 5, 19, 503489) Premabehn has grasped it fully.
('68', 268, 5, 20, 503521) I am a worshipper of the satis.
('68', 268, 5, 21, 503553) But I do not wish to push them down the well.
('68', 268, 5, 22, 503599) Draupadi has shown what a woman's true dharma is.
('68', 268, 5, 23, 503649) Even if the husband falls the wife must not.
('68', 268, 5, 24, 503694) It is pure lechery to stand in the way of a woman when she desires to abstain.
('68', 268, 5, 25, 503773) If he forces himself on her, it is her duty to make him desist even by slapping him.
('68', 268, 5, 26, 503858) She should close her door to the lustful husband.
('68', 268, 5, 27, 503908) She must refuse to be the wife of a sinful husband.
('68', 268, 5, 28, 503960) We must inculcate such courage in women.
('68', 268, 6, 29, 504001) Q. What is the duty of the middle class women in the matter of birth control?
('68', 268, 7, 30, 504079) A. Whether it be the midle class or the aristocracy, indulgence is in our hands.
('68', 268, 7, 31, 504160) But we cannot have control over the consequences.
('68', 268, 7, 32, 504210) It is not for us to ask whether we shall be successful.
('68', 268, 7, 33, 504266) Our task is only to teach them the dharma of truth.
('68', 268, 7, 34, 504318) If the middle class women wish to adopt the latest birth control measures, we must advise them against it.
('68', 268, 7, 35, 504425) Self control alone can be the remedy.
('68', 268, 7, 36, 504463) Premabehn should place before them her own example.
('68', 268, 8, 37, 504515) Q. What should a wife do if the husband has syphilis?
('68', 268, 9, 38, 504569) A. In such circumstances not even any birth control measures can protect the wife.
('68', 268, 9, 39, 504652) She must regard such a husband as impotent and remarry.
('68', 268, 9, 40, 504708) But for this women should have sufficient education to be self reliant.
('68', 269, 0, 1, 504780) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 270
('68', 269, 1, 2, 504822) Q. Like the socialists you also believe that all land belongs to the Lord.
('68', 269, 1, 3, 504897) But today one man tills the soil and another exploits him.
('68', 269, 1, 4, 504956) We want to resolve this conflict of interests with the help of non violence.
('68', 269, 1, 5, 505033) And one does have to resort to evil practices if one wants to earn wealth.
('68', 269, 1, 6, 505108) Under the circumstances, is it not sinful to accept financial help from the rich?
('68', 269, 2, 7, 505190) A. All that we can do is to try to undestand the principle as fully as possible.
('68', 269, 2, 8, 505271) But God alone fully observes the [ideal] dharma.
('68', 269, 2, 9, 505320) We are but imperfect and limited souls.
('68', 269, 2, 10, 505360) Therefore I do not hesitate to receive money from the rich in spite of my belief that piling up wealth is the opposite of dharma.
('68', 269, 2, 11, 505490) I do not consider it wrong to accept money in this way because I believe that thereby I only serve the rich and society in general.
('68', 269, 2, 12, 505622) Up to this point I can also hold my own vis a vis the socialist.
('68', 269, 2, 13, 505687) But I must counter his arguments only with silent service.
('68', 269, 2, 14, 505746) Those who believe that it is wrong to collect money from the rich should act up to their belief.
('68', 269, 2, 15, 505843) But for the Sangh it is dharma although it seems the opposite of it.
('68', 269, 2, 16, 505912) I am crazy about body labour.
('68', 269, 2, 17, 505942) It includes everything.
('68', 269, 2, 18, 505966) What more need be said for the wise?

('68', 270, 2, 3, 506141) [On or before March 5, 1936]
('68', 270, 3, 4, 506170) I had fully hoped to attend the function but God had willed otherwise.
('68', 270, 3, 5, 506241) Though the embargo on my movements has been slightly relaxed, I am still under orders not to accept any public engagements.
('68', 270, 3, 6, 506365) I could go to Delhi, I might as well have gone to Gurukul.
('68', 270, 3, 7, 506424) I am not going to Delhi to fulfil any engagement but for rest and I hope everyone at the Gurukul will understand my inability and excuse it.
('68', 270, 3, 8, 506565) I also hope that my inability to attend will not in any way affect the donations and other help that the Gurukul deserves in an ample measure.
('68', 270, 3, 9, 506708) It had, always had, my blessings.
('68', 270, 3, 10, 506742) Though I cannot go I am glad Sardar Vallabhbhai is going there.
('68', 270, 3, 11, 506806) His going is as good as my going, because he goes there on my behalf and fully represents me.

('68', 270, 7, 15, 506971) PRABHA,
('68', 270, 8, 16, 506979) I got your letter, read it and tore it up.
('68', 270, 8, 17, 507022) I see that you have been going through mental strain.
('68', 270, 8, 18, 507076) You should, however, remember that happiness and unhappiness are passing fancies of the mind, and know that pain is no pain, the only real pain being unmindful of God.
('68', 270, 8, 19, 507244) Yes, you may stay or move about with Jayaprakash as long as he wishes and you can serve him in some useful way.
('68', 270, 8, 20, 507356) Giving him medicine regularly, cooking for him, looking after his personal belongingsall this is service, of course, and so doing you should gain whatever experience you can.
('68', 270, 8, 21, 507531) You should certainly keep seeming relatives and acquaintances if you go to a place like Patna.
('68', 270, 8, 22, 507626) Do all such acts with
('68', 270, 9, 23, 507648) 1 According to Mahadev Desai's telegram dated March 5, 1936, from which this is reproduced, Acharya Devsharma went specially to Savli to persuade Ganhiji to attend the convocation of the Gurukul at Kangri.
('68', 270, 9, 24, 507854) Presumably this letter was sent through Acharya Devsharma.

('68', 271, 1, 3, 508101) I shall of course be pained if you spoil your health.
('68', 271, 1, 4, 508155) Be careful of your diet.
('68', 271, 1, 5, 508180) Write to me the experiences you gather.
('68', 271, 1, 6, 508220) We shall leave Savli tomorrow.
('68', 271, 1, 7, 508251) The marriage of Krishnadas 1 was celebrated here today.
('68', 271, 1, 8, 508307) Both being in every way plain and simple, they had put on nothing more than their usual dress, and there were no presents, etc.
('68', 271, 1, 9, 508435) I have never seen so simple a wedding as this.
('68', 271, 2, 10, 508482) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] We shall reach Delhi on the 8th.

('68', 271, 6, 14, 508631) ANASUYABEHN 2 ,
('68', 271, 7, 15, 508647) Your letter is worthy of you.
('68', 271, 7, 16, 508677) Of course, I do use the flask you gave me and it reminds me of your love.
('68', 271, 7, 17, 508751) So also the mirror.
('68', 271, 7, 18, 508771) Do you know where it came from?
('68', 271, 7, 19, 508803) There has been no occasion to use the razor.
('68', 271, 7, 20, 508848) The question therefore is one only of future.
('68', 271, 7, 21, 508894) I am aware that the metal sheets are imported from abroad but the flask is wholly manufactured abroad.
('68', 271, 7, 22, 508997) For the present the sheets will continue to be imported but the utensils worth crores [of rupees] ought to be made here.
('68', 271, 7, 23, 509118) If German silver sheets are no more imported, we should do without them.
('68', 271, 7, 24, 509191) We should have brass utensils plated with tin or find some other remedy.
('68', 271, 7, 25, 509264) What I mean is that the thought of the villager should be in our minds when we make any purchases.
('68', 271, 7, 26, 509363) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] I am leaving Savli tomorrow and expect to reach Delhi on the 8th.

('68', 272, 3, 4, 509728) BHAI RAMNARESHJI,
('68', 272, 4, 5, 509746) I have your letter and the annotated version of Ramacharit manas, too.
('68', 272, 4, 6, 509817) Daily for half an hour during these days of rest, I listen to the recitation from the Ramayana.
('68', 272, 4, 7, 509913) For the last three days I have been reading your book.
('68', 272, 4, 8, 509968) Apart from reading the passages recited I also started on the preface and I have now progressed on to the biography.
('68', 272, 4, 9, 510085) I have great faith in your rendering.

('68', 272, 10, 15, 510262) Your letter.
('68', 272, 10, 16, 510275) You did the right thing.
('68', 272, 10, 17, 510300) I write a few letters now.
('68', 272, 10, 18, 510327) I have not noticed the effect you fear from the eating of sour things, but it does occur on giving up milk and ghee.
('68', 272, 10, 19, 510444) Anyway you can watch the results if you eschew sour foods for a while.
('68', 272, 10, 20, 510515) For constipation you can experiment with raw garlic weighing up to a tola and taken with the meals.
('68', 272, 10, 21, 510615) I have personal experience of its great benefit.
('68', 272, 10, 22, 510664) Continue with the neem leaves; no harm can possibly result from it.
('68', 272, 10, 23, 510732) What is your routine these days?

('68', 273, 2, 3, 510954) SAVLI, March 5, 1936
('68', 273, 3, 4, 510975) For the past two days I have been trying to get acquainted with each one of you.
('68', 273, 3, 5, 511056) But I have failed.
('68', 273, 3, 6, 511075) I had a desire to meet every one of you and resolve your doubts.
('68', 273, 3, 7, 511140) That would have satisfied you as well as me.
('68', 273, 3, 8, 511185) I have grown rather fond of meeting people individually.
('68', 273, 3, 9, 511242) But I found I should overcome this temptation if I wanted to work.
('68', 273, 3, 10, 511309) You exercised restraint and thus put a check on this fondness.
('68', 273, 3, 11, 511372) None of you sought to meet me and with great reluctance I gave up my desire.
('68', 273, 3, 12, 511449) I had to restrain myself a great deal today.
('68', 273, 3, 13, 511494) It pained me that I could not say anything at the wedding of Krishnadas.
('68', 273, 3, 14, 511567) I did not address even a few words to the newly married couple.
('68', 273, 3, 15, 511631) Some day one will have to suffer even physical separation.
('68', 273, 3, 16, 511690) Then why should we not prepare ourselves for it right from now on?
('68', 273, 3, 17, 511757) The relationship between you and me should be so lasting that it would not be affected by physical separation.
('68', 273, 3, 18, 511868) Let me now reply to Prabhudas Gandhi's questions.
('68', 273, 3, 19, 511918) He has asked me how we can become one with the poor.
('68', 273, 3, 20, 511971) This means that he has been trying, but has not succeeded so far.
('68', 273, 3, 21, 512037) The conclusion to be drawn is that it is only with difficulty that such a state can be attained.
('68', 273, 3, 22, 512134) We have lived on urban life, and we still have a lingering desire for that life.
('68', 273, 3, 23, 512215) On the other hand, the desire to serve the villages is growing.
('68', 273, 3, 24, 512279) I cannot prescribe any method for becoming one with the people.
('68', 273, 3, 25, 512343) Nor do I have one.
('68', 273, 3, 26, 512362) If Vinoba has suggested something, I am not aware of if.
('68', 273, 3, 27, 512419) 1 One cannot say to what extent oneness with the poor in a broad sense is possible.
('68', 273, 3, 28, 512503) Some may be able to attain it in full, and some partially and some not at all throughout their life.
('68', 273, 3, 29, 512604) But we must attain that oneness at any rate in our own hearts.
('68', 273, 3, 30, 512667) Once the heart has begun to experience such oneness, the mind would automatically follow, and we would gradually progress in that direction.
('68', 273, 3, 31, 512808) Whether or not we succeed is in the hands of God.
('68', 273, 3, 32, 512858) What really matters is the effort.
('68', 273, 3, 33, 512893) His second question is whether we should make it a rule that Rs. 4 out of Rs. 15 should be sent direct to some poor person every
('68', 273, 4, 34, 513022) 1 Vinoba Bhave had replied to these questions on the previous day.
('68', 274, 0, 1, 513089) VOL. 68 : 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 275
('68', 274, 1, 2, 513135) It is not up to me to make such a rule.
('68', 274, 1, 3, 513175) Nor is it necessary.
('68', 274, 1, 4, 513196) Even after giving away that amount it cannot be said oneness would have been established between us.
('68', 274, 1, 5, 513297) An external act is no proof of the inner reality.
('68', 274, 1, 6, 513347) If any such rule were to be enforced by the State, people would seek to evade it.
('68', 274, 2, 7, 513429) Q. So long as we do not put an end to economic exploitation of our rural masses and bring them concrete financial gain, they will continue to be indifferent towards us.
('68', 274, 2, 8, 513598) How can we help them?
('68', 274, 3, 9, 513620) A. We face all these difficulties not because the village people do not understand us, but because we are not able to understand them.
('68', 274, 3, 10, 513755) It is a pity.
('68', 274, 3, 11, 513769) Even I have not been able to explain my ideas fully.
('68', 274, 3, 12, 513822) Our work has just begun.
('68', 274, 3, 13, 513847) It is not even a year since it started.
('68', 274, 3, 14, 513887) We do not have enough experience to serve the people.
('68', 274, 3, 15, 513941) I myself have not been able to settle down in a village so far.
('68', 274, 3, 16, 514005) But I have done some research.
('68', 274, 3, 17, 514036) In South Africa I lived in the midst of many villagers and I have experienced their difficulties.
('68', 274, 3, 18, 514134) I also know from experience that we have not yet thought about the reasons why we have not been able to inspire confidence among the villagers.
('68', 274, 3, 19, 514278) We must discover these reasons.
('68', 274, 3, 20, 514310) We are working and spending money in the hope that the villagers will accept what we say.
('68', 274, 3, 21, 514400) When we understand these people they, too, will cling to us.
('68', 274, 3, 22, 514461) Till then, let us scavenge for them, distribute some medicines and teach them the laws of sanitation.
('68', 274, 3, 23, 514563) Let us not go there as physicians.
('68', 274, 3, 24, 514598) Let us be satisfied with giving the medicines which they accept.
('68', 274, 3, 25, 514663) Let us not expect any further rewards.
('68', 274, 3, 26, 514702) Let us not be worried whether or not we give financial help, whether or not they are indifferent.
('68', 274, 3, 27, 514800) I have repeatedly told the village workers that they should not feel disappointed.
('68', 274, 3, 28, 514883) Have they not turned themselves into sweepers?
('68', 274, 3, 29, 514930) And a sweeper is satisfied even with the left overs.
('68', 274, 3, 30, 514983) Let us also go to them with such an attitude.
('68', 274, 3, 31, 515029) If they abuse us, let us bear it in silence.
('68', 274, 3, 32, 515074) If they beat us, let us bear that also.
('68', 274, 3, 33, 515114) It is not that they are not coming forward because their economic conditions are not good.
('68', 274, 3, 34, 515205) They would not come even if you offered them money.
('68', 274, 3, 35, 515257) They would take the money and also expect us to do the scavenging for them.
('68', 274, 3, 36, 515333) That is all.
('68', 274, 3, 37, 515346) Let us work so that the sick are given medicines.
('68', 274, 3, 38, 515396) Let the people defecate wherever they choose.
('68', 274, 3, 39, 515442) Let us not even ask them to avoid a particular place or go elsewhere.
('68', 274, 3, 40, 515512) But let us go on cleaning up without a word.
('68', 274, 3, 41, 515557) That is non violence.
('68', 274, 3, 42, 515579) Protecting their health, showing them the way and going on cleaning up is the only path we have to follow.
('68', 274, 4, 43, 515686) 1 Gandhiji then replied to the questions asked by Swami Anand.
('68', 275, 0, 1, 515749) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 276
('68', 275, 1, 2, 515791) Some day they are bound to understand.
('68', 275, 1, 3, 515830) If this does not work, then there is no such thing as non violence.
('68', 275, 2, 4, 515898) Q. Is it or is it not necessary to do something more than this?
('68', 275, 3, 5, 515962) A. We may if we can.
('68', 275, 3, 6, 515983) But it is not necessary to connect the two.
('68', 275, 3, 7, 516027) They are two independent services.
('68', 275, 3, 8, 516062) Even if we cannot take up the service that would bring them economic benefits, let us at least take up the first one.
('68', 275, 3, 9, 516180) And let us not worry if we can do nothing more.
('68', 275, 4, 10, 516228) Q. Can a village worker, with a view to making consumer articles available to the villagers at low prices, run a shop and sell betel leaves, bidis, tobacco, fish, tea, etc.?
('68', 275, 5, 11, 516402) A. We can resort to every means to put an extra pice into the villagers' pockets.
('68', 275, 5, 12, 516484) But whether or not a village worker can open a shop depends on his own capacity and resourcefulness.
('68', 275, 5, 13, 516585) I cannot lay down any hard and fast rule as to the articles a village worker may have in his shop.
('68', 275, 5, 14, 516684) Let each worker fix a limit for himself in accordance with his own ability.
('68', 275, 5, 15, 516760) He will have to compete with the village shopkeepers and also consider the habits of the villagers.
('68', 275, 5, 16, 516860) If I go to the villages and find that the people cannot do without tobacco and bidis, I would sell these, too, even though I consider tobacco worse than alcohol.
('68', 275, 5, 17, 517022) A habit that has been entrenched for thousands of years cannot go in a day.
('68', 275, 5, 18, 517098) My work has not been directed towards making people give up smoking.
('68', 275, 5, 19, 517167) Ideal is one thing, practice is another and what other people can do is yet another.
('68', 275, 6, 20, 517252) Q. Then would you sell liquor also?
('68', 275, 7, 21, 517288) I would not sell liquor.
('68', 275, 7, 22, 517313) I would not give them something which they hate and which even the drink addicts consider evil.
('68', 275, 7, 23, 517409) But if I went to England and found that I could not rid people of this habit, I would sell liquor.
('68', 275, 7, 24, 517508) And if there are people who eat meat or fish and want them clean, I would supply these, too, with my own hands.
('68', 275, 7, 25, 517620) Let my words not be taken literally and misinterpreted.
('68', 275, 7, 26, 517676) I shall certainly try to make people give up things which are considered bad.
('68', 275, 7, 27, 517754) But I would give them those things till I could persuade them to give them up and continue with my work.
('68', 275, 7, 28, 517859) It is very difficult to run a shop.
('68', 275, 7, 29, 517895) A resourceful man like Lakshmidas can do much.
('68', 275, 7, 30, 517942) The path of village organization is arduous.
('68', 275, 7, 31, 517987) There is no royal road.
('68', 275, 7, 32, 518011) He who serves sincerely will find the right way.
('68', 276, 0, 1, 518060) VOL. 68 : 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 277
('68', 276, 1, 2, 518106) Q. Should we not use bullock carts instead of motor lorries to transport the goods made or produced in the villages?
('68', 276, 2, 3, 518223) A. This is a ticklish question.
('68', 276, 2, 4, 518255) I have no answer to it which can touch your heart.
('68', 276, 2, 5, 518306) I shall only say that I am helpless.
('68', 276, 2, 6, 518343) Motor vehicles are invading the villages day after day.
('68', 276, 2, 7, 518399) The question involved is that of service of the cow.
('68', 276, 2, 8, 518452) We must continue our efforts in good faith.
('68', 276, 2, 9, 518496) Shall I lay down the principle?
('68', 276, 2, 10, 518528) If we do not try to understand aright this question of service to the cow we might start eating beef.
('68', 276, 2, 11, 518630) Even today if the doctor advises, people would not mind taking beef as medicine.
('68', 276, 2, 12, 518711) You cannot carry on with buffalo's milk.
('68', 276, 2, 13, 518752) I have seen beef being consumed in the name of medicine even in Vaishanva families.
('68', 276, 2, 14, 518836) But let us remember that if the cow perishes, we shall perish, too.
('68', 276, 2, 15, 518904) The motor car has been invading the villages.
('68', 276, 2, 16, 518950) If this goes on, India will become another South Africa.
('68', 276, 2, 17, 519007) I do not favour small holdings.
('68', 276, 2, 18, 519039) But at the same time I do not wish to see that any single individual should own twenty or twenty five thousand acres of land.
('68', 276, 2, 19, 519165) Today service to the cow is more expensive than a motor vehicle.
('68', 276, 2, 20, 519230) But this question is similar to the question of khadi.
('68', 276, 2, 21, 519285) I have sold khadi cloth worth two annas a yard at 17 annas a yard.
('68', 276, 2, 22, 519352) I am talking of an ideal.
('68', 276, 2, 23, 519378) Our duty is to carry on work with faith in our heart.
('68', 276, 3, 24, 519432) RAJENDRA PRASAD: But is it a proven fact that it is cheaper to use a motor car?
('68', 276, 4, 25, 519512) A. Absolutely not.
('68', 276, 4, 26, 519531) The question of expensive or inexpensive is not correct.
('68', 276, 4, 27, 519588) The law of demand and supply is not a human law, it is a devilish law.
('68', 276, 5, 28, 519659) Q. Would it be proper, in the light of your definition of swadeshi, to procure for Bombay rice from Ahmedabad or wheat from Khandwa?
('68', 276, 5, 29, 519792) Will it not be proper to fix a ceiling on profit in respect of every commodity?
('68', 276, 6, 30, 519872) A. Limits should be fixed both as to the quantum of profit and the distance.
('68', 276, 6, 31, 519949) Let us not get all our rice from Bombay.
('68', 276, 6, 32, 519990) Sitarama Sastri sends rice to Bombay.
('68', 276, 6, 33, 520028) In fact, it should be [sold] 1 in Guntur District.
('68', 276, 6, 34, 520079) The proper thing would be to utilize rice where it is grown.
('68', 276, 6, 35, 520140) My definition of swadeshi is old but it is valid.
('68', 276, 6, 36, 520190) Only by following it can we evolve a new kind of economics.
('68', 276, 6, 37, 520250) True economics must follow ethics.
('68', 276, 6, 38, 520285) Even if we fail in this we shall have succeeded.
('68', 276, 7, 39, 520334) Q. The village workers employ middle men instead of taking the help of the villagers.
('68', 276, 7, 40, 520420) Is this proper?
('68', 276, 8, 41, 520436) A. There should be direct dealings as far as possible.

('68', 277, 0, 1, 520514) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 278
('68', 277, 1, 2, 520556) Q. Hand pounded rice, hand ground flour, oil, etc., can be made in cities also.
('68', 277, 1, 3, 520636) Would you call them village industries?
('68', 277, 2, 4, 520676) A. Today we seem to be going in the wrong direction in the name of dietary reform.
('68', 277, 2, 5, 520759) There is not enough milk in the villages.
('68', 277, 2, 6, 520801) So Dr. Tilak recommends that milk powder should be brought from Bombay.
('68', 277, 2, 7, 520873) It is a terrible thing.
('68', 277, 2, 8, 520897) We must never do it.
('68', 277, 2, 9, 520918) We must stop the exploitation of villages by all possible means.
('68', 277, 2, 10, 520983) We must persuade the villagers not to sell milk.

('68', 277, 5, 13, 521108) 338. SPEECH AT GANDHI SEVA SANGH MEETINGVI 1
('68', 277, 6, 14, 521153) SAVLI, March 6, 1936
('68', 277, 7, 15, 521174) Q. With regard to the policy adopted by the Sangh last year under your advice on the question of the States, has not the time come, according to you, when the Sangh should concentrate more on the work in the States and make concerted efforts in the direction?
('68', 277, 8, 16, 521434) A. I have forgotten what I had agreed to.
('68', 277, 8, 17, 521476) But I am quite clear about my attitude on the subject.
('68', 277, 8, 18, 521531) We should no doubt make concerted efforts in the matter.
('68', 277, 8, 19, 521588) But how can I say what kind of effforts should be considered concerted?
('68', 277, 8, 20, 521660) Trying to do well what can be done through the State should be considered concerted efforts.
('68', 277, 9, 21, 521753) Q. Would you adopt the same policy of co operation even in the States where Englishmen or their people have been appointed Prime Ministers, army commanders, police officials, etc., and where the administration is carried on in a large measure along British lines?
('68', 277, 10, 22, 522017) A. There can be no change in our policy even if the entire staff of the States consists of Englishmen.
('68', 277, 10, 23, 522120) I can well imagine the difficulties that would arise in such a situation.
('68', 277, 10, 24, 522194) But there could be no solution to it.
('68', 277, 10, 25, 522232) Even if all the officials were Englishmen the administration could still be carried on in the name of the State.
('68', 277, 11, 26, 522345) Q. Is there now any change in your opinion that there should be no British interference in the affairs of the States?
('68', 277, 11, 27, 522463) If not, why did you allow Shri Manibhai and Shri Jamnalalji to act as they did?
('68', 277, 12, 28, 522543) 1 Gandhiji first replied to the remaining questions from Swami Anand and then to those put by Ramnarayan Chaudhari in regard to the States.
('68', 278, 0, 1, 522683) VOL. 68 : 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 279
('68', 278, 1, 2, 522729) A. Whatever Shri Jamnalalji and Shri Manilalji have done has been with my consent.
('68', 278, 1, 3, 522812) But my policy in that matter is the same as it was.
('68', 278, 1, 4, 522864) Through a policy I arrive at a principle; but I do not wish to restrict the field of its operation.
('68', 278, 1, 5, 522964) Even in my dreams I do not wish for British interference.
('68', 278, 1, 6, 523022) But those who wish for such interference under exceptional circumstances have fixed their own limits.
('68', 278, 1, 7, 523124) Everyone has a right to fix his own lmit; and if somebody comes to consult me, I can even fix the limit for him keeping in mind the individual concerned.
('68', 278, 1, 8, 523278) Someone asked me if, under the same circumstances, another person could do what Shri Jamnalalji was doing.
('68', 278, 1, 9, 523385) I told him to come to me with Jamnalalji and then I would answer.
('68', 278, 1, 10, 523451) Only when a person has full understanding of the situation, can he fix the limit after deciding the extent to which the principle can be applied in the given situation.
('68', 278, 1, 11, 523620) His conduct cannot serve as an example to others.
('68', 278, 1, 12, 523670) The qualification of the person also to be considered.
('68', 278, 1, 13, 523725) I can say that in letting Jamnalalji or Manilalji go it was not my intention to seek interference.
('68', 278, 1, 14, 523824) But even supposing that the principle was set aside, it should be attributed to my failing rather than made a precedent.
('68', 278, 1, 15, 523945) He who is firm must adhere to the principle.
('68', 278, 1, 16, 523990) Violent and non violent activities are going on side by side.
('68', 278, 1, 17, 524052) God is their witness.
('68', 278, 1, 18, 524074) People see only the effects.
('68', 278, 1, 19, 524103) We shall see the causes.
('68', 278, 1, 20, 524128) The way I have been practising non violence appears to be a novel thing.
('68', 278, 1, 21, 524201) The Jains and the Buddhists also experimented in non violence.
('68', 278, 1, 22, 524264) But that non violence has become restricted to diet.
('68', 278, 1, 23, 524317) Political and social activities also are inspired by both violent and non violent forces.
('68', 278, 1, 24, 524407) On the surface they do not appear to be different.
('68', 278, 1, 25, 524458) But the difference lies in their motivation.
('68', 278, 1, 26, 524503) There would be no trouble if we remember this point in everything we do.
('68', 278, 1, 27, 524576) And there would be no difficulties.
('68', 278, 2, 28, 524612) Q. Can newspapers concerned only with the problems of the States be run in accordance with your policy?
('68', 278, 3, 29, 524716) A. I am afraid such newspapers are not run in accordance with my policy.
('68', 278, 3, 30, 524789) But how can I convince those whose point of view is altogether different?
('68', 278, 3, 31, 524863) In my view, there is no need to have different newspapers for the States.
('68', 278, 3, 32, 524937) Our work will not be done through newspapers.
('68', 278, 3, 33, 524983) My advice would be that we work in silence.
('68', 278, 3, 34, 525027) Let us do whatever the officials of the States permit us to do.
('68', 278, 3, 35, 525091) If we cannot work like this, let us withdraw.
('68', 278, 3, 36, 525137) We will achieve in the States what we achieve in British India.
('68', 278, 3, 37, 525201) It is like the rule of three.
('68', 278, 3, 38, 525231) The States' people are slaves
('68', 279, 0, 1, 525261) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 280
('68', 279, 1, 2, 525303) of slaves.
('68', 279, 1, 3, 525314) Those who work according to my idea cannot be slaves.
('68', 279, 1, 4, 525368) But those who follow the path of non violence must proceed after great thought.
('68', 279, 1, 5, 525448) Whatever we may be able to do there must be done in such a manner that no British interference would be possible at all.
('68', 279, 1, 6, 525569) India will not attain swaraj through agitation carried on in the States.
('68', 279, 1, 7, 525642) Maulana Abul Kalam Azad once said that the whole country was a gurudwara.
('68', 279, 1, 8, 525716) That very moment it occurred to me that the whole country was a prison.
('68', 279, 1, 9, 525788) And the States are doubly so.
('68', 279, 1, 10, 525818) The facilities available in the States are those available in a jail.
('68', 279, 1, 11, 525888) I wish to tell you a couple of things.
('68', 279, 1, 12, 525927) I spoke without authority earlier, I shall speak without authority now also.
('68', 279, 1, 13, 526004) I heard with a sense of pain that the committee for Gandhian thought 1 which had been formed has ceased to exist.
('68', 279, 1, 14, 526118) Since it had not come into existence as a result of any resolution of the Sangh but voluntarily, it was within its right to wind itself up.
('68', 279, 1, 15, 526258) But I hear that the committee has broken up because I was not in favour of it.
('68', 279, 1, 16, 526337) But I could have been consulted.
('68', 279, 1, 17, 526370) I was just here.
('68', 279, 1, 18, 526387) If anybody says that I desire this and I desire that, do not believe it.
('68', 279, 1, 19, 526460) It is my misfortune that my words can be interpreted in two or more ways.
('68', 279, 1, 20, 526534) I do try to speak and write a language from which only one meaning can be drawn.
('68', 279, 1, 21, 526615) But language is an imperfect instrument.
('68', 279, 1, 22, 526656) And then I am no master of language.
('68', 279, 1, 23, 526693) Where shall I find the power to put down in writing all that is in my mind?
('68', 279, 1, 24, 526769) My words affect different people in different ways.
('68', 279, 1, 25, 526821) I did not mean to say that you should not propagate my ideas.
('68', 279, 1, 26, 526883) I do not believe it is [your] duty to explain my views.
('68', 279, 1, 27, 526939) But I do have the vanity to believe that my ideas are right.
('68', 279, 1, 28, 527000) And because of this I am also keen on explaining them to my colleagues.
('68', 279, 1, 29, 527072) I possess the faculty of speech also.
('68', 279, 1, 30, 527110) And that necessarily results in some propaganda.
('68', 279, 1, 31, 527159) I also wish that my ideas are propagated.
('68', 279, 1, 32, 527201) But I had a feeling that you were being pretentious.
('68', 279, 1, 33, 527254) I wanted to avoid it.
('68', 279, 1, 34, 527276) It was not that I did not want the committee to be formed.
('68', 279, 1, 35, 527335) The committee could have been formed, but it should have been as I wanted it to be.
('68', 279, 1, 36, 527419) I am bound to express my views so long as I am alive.
('68', 279, 1, 37, 527473) What then is the harm in forming such a committee?
('68', 279, 1, 38, 527524) This committee can be instrumental in propagating my thoughts and my words.
('68', 279, 1, 39, 527600) So I wish the committee is formed again and functions within its limits.
('68', 279, 1, 40, 527673) Is it ever possible that any work with which Kakasaheb is associated would be considered worthless by me?
('68', 279, 1, 41, 527779) I had no apprehension that the committee would do any wrong.
('68', 279, 1, 42, 527840) But why

('68', 280, 1, 3, 527968) And even if one believes that I wanted to undo the work of the committee, why did other members join me in undoing the work and why did it become necessary for Kakasaheb to carry it all on his own?
('68', 280, 1, 4, 528166) MAHADEV DESAI: Who gave you the information that the committee had broken up?
('68', 280, 1, 5, 528244) It has only been adjourned.
('68', 280, 1, 6, 528272) It can become active any time it is desired.
('68', 280, 2, 7, 528317) A. I am making these observations from something that I have heard.
('68', 280, 2, 8, 528385) It is a happy thing if it has not broken up.
('68', 280, 2, 9, 528430) Kakasaheb gave me the assurance that he was to do the work all by himself.
('68', 280, 2, 10, 528505) Now the committee should give him its co operation.
('68', 280, 2, 11, 528557) Another thing which I want to say relates to the functioning of the Sangh.
('68', 280, 2, 12, 528632) When I said that every worker of the Sangh should work with the pickaxe during the day and at night there should be discussion for some two or three hours, I did not mean that the Sangh should be wound up.
('68', 280, 2, 13, 528838) You are so many and you are also efficient; I would, therefore, say nothing on such an occasion.
('68', 280, 2, 14, 528935) I am old and close to death.
('68', 280, 2, 15, 528964) My memory also has grown weak.
('68', 280, 2, 16, 528995) Hence, I say whatever I can remember.
('68', 280, 2, 17, 529033) What I said has been only to encourage you in your work, and your progress.
('68', 280, 2, 18, 529109) So do not think I want to criticize, rather think that I want to explain something to you.
('68', 280, 2, 19, 529200) Try to learn something new from it.
('68', 280, 2, 20, 529236) The Sangh is proceeding on right lines today.
('68', 280, 2, 21, 529282) I am not so completely deprived of my reasoning as to suggest its winding up at such a time.
('68', 280, 2, 22, 529375) There is a new point, but I shall deal with it if there is any time left.
('68', 280, 2, 23, 529449) I shall speak about the next session.
('68', 280, 2, 24, 529487) Let the next session be held at a place which is not so far away from a railway station that one cannot reach there either on foot or by a bullock cart.
('68', 280, 2, 25, 529640) As for me it does not matter if the place is even fifty miles away.
('68', 280, 2, 26, 529708) But then the condition should be that everyone should walk to the place.
('68', 280, 2, 27, 529781) The luggage too should be taken in a bullock cart, not a motor car.
('68', 280, 2, 28, 529849) If some handicapped persons like me do not come, let them stay away.
('68', 280, 2, 29, 529918) But I shall definitely come.
('68', 280, 2, 30, 529947) You may provide for me a bullock cart or carry me on your shoulders.
('68', 280, 2, 31, 530016) I shall not fight shy of either.
('68', 280, 2, 32, 530049) We have to go and put that village into shape.
('68', 280, 2, 33, 530096) Let us select areas where there is no doctor or engineer.
('68', 280, 2, 34, 530154) If there is paucity of water, let us dig wells.
('68', 280, 2, 35, 530202) If there are no cows there, let us get cows for them.
('68', 280, 2, 36, 530256) I would even insist that we should drink only cow's milk.
('68', 280, 2, 37, 530314) Let us not give up milk on any account.
('68', 280, 2, 38, 530354) If I pour out my heart to you about goseva, I could make you cry and break down myself.
('68', 280, 2, 39, 530442) My heart is so full of sorrow.
('68', 281, 0, 1, 530473) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 282
('68', 281, 1, 2, 530515) I would insist that we should have only cows.
('68', 281, 1, 3, 530561) How can we serve India if we cannot insist even on this much?
('68', 281, 1, 4, 530623) When one calls me obstinate I feel that I have some kind of insistence.
('68', 281, 1, 5, 530695) And all that I insist upon is that we should not take buffalo's milk but only cow's milk and should never give up milk.
('68', 281, 1, 6, 530815) I shall be content even to die while insisting on it.
('68', 281, 1, 7, 530869) Let us find out a village where cow's milk will be available, where it would be possible to procure green vegetables, pure water, etc., and start our preparations right from now on.
('68', 281, 1, 8, 531051) Let us not be worried if the place is far away.
('68', 281, 1, 9, 531099) We shall serve the people living nearby and get new experiences every moment.
('68', 281, 1, 10, 531177) I have placed before you what according to me is the most correct point of view.
('68', 281, 1, 11, 531258) If the session is to be held, let us start the preparations right from today.
('68', 281, 1, 12, 531336) Let us make a close study of the village.
('68', 281, 1, 13, 531378) We have been passing through a long period of degradation.
('68', 281, 1, 14, 531437) We have no strength to raise ourselves.
('68', 281, 1, 15, 531477) All the work of the Congress is not being carried on according to my wishes.
('68', 281, 1, 16, 531554) When I say this, I am not criticizing the Congress.
('68', 281, 1, 17, 531606) But will they ever hold the Congress session in an obscure place?
('68', 281, 2, 18, 531672) Even if we can get eleven months to make our preparations for the next session it would not be too long.
('68', 281, 2, 19, 531777) The place should provide enough work for the workers.
('68', 281, 2, 20, 531831) If there is dearth of cows we should bring some from the surrounding areas.
('68', 281, 2, 21, 531907) We should look after these cows while we are there and if the people of the village are prepared to keep them we may leave these cows with them.
('68', 281, 2, 22, 532052) Otherwise we should take them back.
('68', 281, 3, 23, 532088) If we work in this manner we shall derive greater benefit than from a long speech.
('68', 281, 3, 24, 532171) I am sayng all this from the point of view of the purest ideal.
('68', 281, 3, 25, 532235) This is not a matter of money.
('68', 281, 3, 26, 532266) It is a matter of intelligence.
('68', 281, 3, 27, 532298) The session is to be held twelve months hence.
('68', 281, 3, 28, 532345) I can invite you to Segaon.
('68', 281, 3, 29, 532373) But I am not allowed to do so.
('68', 281, 3, 30, 532404) Whoever desires to invite the session, must do so within a month.
('68', 281, 3, 31, 532470) We ourselves must perform the functions of the doctor, engineer, mason, carpenter, etc.
('68', 281, 3, 32, 532558) I cannot understand how you can put up with buffalo's milk.
('68', 281, 3, 33, 532618) Arrangements should, therefore, be made for cow's milk and green vegetables.
('68', 281, 4, 34, 532695) I wish to mention to you another subject.
('68', 281, 4, 35, 532737) First I thought that Vinoba should discuss it.
('68', 281, 4, 36, 532784) But since I have some time, I shall myself mention it.
('68', 281, 4, 37, 532839) It is my nature to share a good thing with everyone.
('68', 281, 4, 38, 532892) This thing arose many years back.
('68', 281, 4, 39, 532926) Chhaganlal may be a witness to this.
('68', 281, 4, 40, 532963) I was then in the midst of the Zulu War.
('68', 281, 4, 41, 533004) Chhaganlal can tell you the
('68', 282, 0, 1, 533032) VOL. 68 : 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 283
('68', 282, 2, 2, 533078) CHHAGANLAL GANDHI: 1906.
('68', 282, 3, 3, 533103) Yes, it was during that time and a great thing it was.
('68', 282, 3, 4, 533158) Look, this is how the Divine play goes on.
('68', 282, 3, 5, 533201) I realized there that one who wishes to serve the world must practise brahmacharya.
('68', 282, 3, 6, 533285) A married couple should also observe brahmacharya, by which I mean cessation of reproductive activity.
('68', 282, 3, 7, 533388) I believe that those who procreate cannot be called brahmacharis.
('68', 282, 3, 8, 533454) Hence I placed this ideal of brahmacharya before Chhaganlal and others.
('68', 282, 3, 9, 533526) I was quite young then and a young person can do anything.
('68', 282, 3, 10, 533585) If I ask all of you to practise brahmacharya, would that be practicable?
('68', 282, 3, 11, 533658) It is only an ideal.
('68', 282, 3, 12, 533679) So I myself preside over many marrriages.
('68', 282, 3, 13, 533721) While laying down the ideal, I do see that people will indulge in pleasure.
('68', 282, 3, 14, 533797) I was under the impression that brahmacharya and procreation were contradictory.
('68', 282, 3, 15, 533878) But on Thursday Vinoba brought to me a problem.
('68', 282, 3, 16, 533926) It was a quotation from the Shastras.
('68', 282, 3, 17, 533964) I had not realized its significance earlier.
('68', 282, 3, 18, 534009) It has filled my heart with a new light.
('68', 282, 3, 19, 534050) I lost myself in pondering over it.
('68', 282, 3, 20, 534086) I am still under its spell.
('68', 282, 3, 21, 534114) The scriptural interpretation of brahmacharya is perfect.
('68', 282, 3, 22, 534172) An avowed brahmachari is one who has practised it since birth, who has not lost semen even in a dream.
('68', 282, 3, 23, 534275) But I did not know why a person who cohabits for the sake of procreation was considered a brahmachari.
('68', 282, 3, 24, 534378) Yesterday this great truth flashed on my mind.
('68', 282, 3, 25, 534425) The couple which, in a state of marriage, withdraw into privacy and cohabit for the purpose of procreation are brahmacharis in the right sense of the word.
('68', 282, 3, 26, 534581) What we call marriage today is but its outward form.
('68', 282, 3, 27, 534634) What we call pleasure is only dissipation.
('68', 282, 3, 28, 534677) Although I maintained that the motive behind marriage was procreation, what I meant to convey was that neither party should dread having children or make efforts to avoid this natural consequence of the sex act in which both should be willing partners.
('68', 282, 3, 29, 534930) I did not realize that it had a greater purpose.
('68', 282, 3, 30, 534979) But this also was not the perfect marriage.
('68', 282, 3, 31, 535023) The perfect marriage is founded on brahmacharya.
('68', 282, 3, 32, 535072) When can a marriage be called perfect?
('68', 282, 3, 33, 535111) In a perfect marriage a couple may have children when they are necessary and cohabit only when they need a child.
('68', 282, 3, 34, 535225) That is to say, procreation ought to be looked upon as a duty and sexual union resorted to for that purpose only.
('68', 282, 3, 35, 535339) Apart from this they should never engage in the sex act.
('68', 282, 3, 36, 535396) Nor should they allow themselves privacy.
('68', 282, 3, 37, 535438) If a man controls his semen, except on the occasion of such purposeful cohabitation, he is
('68', 283, 0, 1, 535529) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 284
('68', 283, 1, 2, 535571) as good as an avowed brahmachari.
('68', 283, 1, 3, 535605) Just imagine, how many occasions for such cohabitation can there be in a lifetime?
('68', 283, 1, 4, 535688) In the life of a healthy and virile man or woman, there may be only one such occasion.
('68', 283, 1, 5, 535775) Why should such persons not be looked upon as avowed brahmacharis?
('68', 283, 1, 6, 535842) This truth, of which I had only a glimpse earlier, is now as clear as daylight.
('68', 283, 1, 7, 535922) Those who are married should think of it.
('68', 283, 1, 8, 535964) I had mentioned this subject earlier also; but I had not so much faith then.
('68', 283, 1, 9, 536041) I used to think that it was impracticable.
('68', 283, 1, 10, 536084) Today I think it is practicable.
('68', 283, 1, 11, 536117) It might be different in the animal world.
('68', 283, 1, 12, 536160) But it must be a rule in the married life of man, that no couple should procreate without the need for a child nor should they cohabit without the object of procreation.

('68', 283, 3, 14, 536343) Gandhi Seva Sanghke Dwitiya Adhiveshan (Savli) Ka Vivaran, pp.
('68', 283, 4, 15, 536406) 339. A CONTRAST
('68', 283, 5, 16, 536422) Savli is a little village in the District of Chanda, C.P. It has a large Harijan population, and Harijans are for the most part devoted to khadi production under the aegis of the Maharashtra Charkha Sangh.
('68', 283, 5, 17, 536628) Member of the Gandhi Seva Sangh and some other workers met there between 29th February and 6th March.
('68', 283, 5, 18, 536730) In the Hindi notices sent to the invitees, among the things they were to bring were lantern, writing material, postcards, envelopes, postage stamps and soap.
('68', 283, 5, 19, 536888) The notices mentioned that it was difficult to procure any milk in Savli and cow's milk was practically unprocurable.
('68', 283, 5, 20, 537006) Those who would take no ghee other than cow's ghee were advised to bring their own supply.
('68', 283, 5, 21, 537097) On reaching Savli, it was further discovered that for the 300 men and women gathered there, milk had to be brought all the way from Chanda, a distance of 34 miles, and fresh vegetables from Nagpur, a distance of over 120 miles.
('68', 283, 5, 22, 537325) Savli is a typical village.
('68', 283, 5, 23, 537353) The difficulties mentioned above are to be met with in most of the villages of this land.
('68', 283, 5, 24, 537443) India worships the cow, and cow's milk is unprocurable in the majority of our villages!
('68', 283, 5, 25, 537531) She has a climate fit enough everywhere for vegetable growth, and fresh vegetables are not to be found in many of her villages!
('68', 283, 5, 26, 537659) It is no wonder that writing material and stationery are scarce in the thousands of our impoverished villages.
('68', 283, 5, 27, 537770) The villagers are
('68', 284, 0, 1, 537788) VOL. 68 : 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 285
('68', 284, 1, 2, 537834) mostly illiterate and those who can write have not money enough to invest in writing material or stamps.
('68', 284, 1, 3, 537939) It is profitless to find out whether the villages of India were always what they are today.
('68', 284, 1, 4, 538031) If they were never better it is a reflection upon the ancient culture in which we take so much pride.
('68', 284, 1, 5, 538133) But if they were never better, how is it that they have survived centuries of decay which we see going round us and of which Savli is but a type?
('68', 284, 1, 6, 538279) The task before every lover of the country is how to prevent this decay or, which is the same thing, how to reconstruct the villages of India so that it may be as easy for anyone to live in them as it is supposed to be in the cities.
('68', 284, 1, 7, 538513) Indeed, it is the task before every patriot.
('68', 284, 1, 8, 538558) It may be that the villages are beyond redemption, that rural civilization has had its day and that the seven hundred thousand villages have to give place to seven hundred well ordered cities supporting a population not of three hundred millions but thirty.
('68', 284, 1, 9, 538816) If such is to be Indias fate, even that won't come in a day.
('68', 284, 1, 10, 538877) It must take time to wipe out a large number of villages and villagers and transform the remainder into cities and citizens.
('68', 284, 1, 11, 539002) However, those who believe in the possibility of village reconstruction have to follow out their programme logically and truthfully and not be satisfied with any make believe.
('68', 284, 1, 12, 539178) For them Savli is an eye opener.
('68', 284, 1, 13, 539211) Any village ought to be able easily to accommodate a party of 300 men and women with perfect comfort and give them fresh open air, fragrant grass and good rich milk from healthy cows and fresh vegetables and fruit in addition.
('68', 284, 1, 14, 539438) Surely there is something radically wrong if many of these things have to be brought from cities.
('68', 284, 1, 15, 539536) There is no trick of magic that can bring about this change overnight.
('68', 284, 1, 16, 539607) But with patience and perseverance, the programme of reconstruction can be carried out without much difficulty.
('68', 284, 1, 17, 539719) But nothing can be done if ardent workers do not settle down in villages with the fixed determination of reconstructing their villages in the right manner.

('68', 285, 3, 4, 539975) MY DEAR REBEL,
('68', 285, 4, 5, 539990) Your letter was waiting for me when I arrived here.
('68', 285, 4, 6, 540042) The weather is not hot but there is nothing cold about it.
('68', 285, 4, 7, 540101) It rained near Jhansi.
('68', 285, 4, 8, 540124) We are all well.
('68', 285, 4, 9, 540141) Ba and Navin 1 are the additions to the party.
('68', 285, 4, 10, 540188) Puri too was with us.
('68', 285, 4, 11, 540210) I sent a wire as soon as we arrived.
('68', 285, 4, 12, 540247) 2 I hope you received it.
('68', 285, 4, 13, 540273) You may be proud of the frilling to the uppers miscalled shawls or scarves.
('68', 285, 4, 14, 540349) I am proud of your spinning.
('68', 285, 4, 15, 540378) For spinning is real art.
('68', 285, 4, 16, 540404) And for youa novice the effort is quite worthy.
('68', 285, 4, 17, 540452) There, once in a way, even a rebel may receive a compliment

('68', 285, 8, 22, 540693) March 8, 1936
('68', 285, 9, 23, 540707) I see something troubles your mind, though you may try to conceal it.
('68', 285, 9, 24, 540777) You may certainly come according to your wish, provided you get the permission.
('68', 285, 9, 25, 540857) It will be the greatest service you render to Jayaprakash if you lay before him your correct position with the utmost firmness and calm of mind.
('68', 285, 9, 26, 541002) I am afraid you have not fully stated your case to Jayaprakash and if you have, it did not make any impression on him, that is, he does not take the statement to be correct.
('68', 285, 9, 27, 541176) He will calm down without doubt, if he is convinced that you have in you no such thing as sexual desire.
('68', 285, 9, 28, 541281) Your freedom from desire should put out the fire of his, just as water puts out any fire.
('68', 285, 9, 29, 541371) Why should you be afraid and lose peace of mind, when you do have faith in God?

('68', 286, 6, 11, 542011) While giving his blessings to the outgoing graduates, Sardar Patel at first read out a message from Mahatma Gandhi sent to the outgoing graduates in which he had asked them to lead a life of truth, purity and service and to never forget that the institution to which they were bidding farewell was founded by the late Swami Shraddhanand who died while serving the nation to his last breath.
('68', 286, 7, 12, 542402) The anniversary of the Gurukul concluded when a message from Mahatma Gandhi asking the public to give liberal donations to the Gurukul was read out by Sardar Patel.
('68', 286, 7, 13, 542567) In that message, Mahatmaji had expected everybody present there to fill the coffers of the Gurukul which was run by contributions from the public.

('68', 286, 11, 17, 542818) So you return leaving Kamala for ever in Europe.
('68', 286, 11, 18, 542867) And yet her spirit was never out of India and will always be your precious treasure as it will be of many of us.
('68', 286, 11, 19, 542980) I shall never forget the final talk that wetted our four eyes.
('68', 286, 11, 20, 543043) Heavy responsibility awaits you here.
('68', 286, 11, 21, 543081) It is laid on you because you are well able to bear it.
('68', 286, 11, 22, 543137) I dare not come to you, as I would have if my body had regained its original elasticity.
('68', 286, 11, 23, 543226) There is nothing organically wrong with me.
('68', 286, 11, 24, 543270) The body has even gained in weight.
('68', 286, 11, 25, 543306) But it has lost the vitality it seemed to have only three months ago.
('68', 286, 11, 26, 543376) Strange

('68', 287, 1, 3, 543544) And yet the body had become weak and the instrument registered high blood pressure.
('68', 287, 1, 4, 543628) I have to be careful.
('68', 287, 1, 5, 543650) I am in Delhi to rest for a few days.
('68', 287, 1, 6, 543688) If your original plan had been carried out I would have remained in Wardha for our meeting.
('68', 287, 1, 7, 543780) It would have been quieter there for you.
('68', 287, 1, 8, 543822) But if it is the same thing to you, we may meet in Delhi where I should be till 23rd instant at least.
('68', 287, 1, 9, 543925) But if you prefer Wardha I can return there earlier.
('68', 287, 1, 10, 543978) If you come to Delhi, you could stay with me in the Harijan quarters newly built in Kingswayquite a good place.
('68', 287, 1, 11, 544090) You will tell me, when you can, the date of our meeting.
('68', 287, 1, 12, 544147) Rajendra Babu and Jamnalalji are or will be with you.
('68', 287, 1, 13, 544201) Vallabhbhai also would have been but we all thought it would be better if he stayed away.
('68', 287, 1, 14, 544291) The other two have gone there not for political discussion but for condolence.
('68', 287, 1, 15, 544370) The political discussion will take place when we have all met and when you have finished domestic work.
('68', 287, 1, 16, 544474) I hope Indu bore well the grief of Kamalas death and the almost immediate separation from you.
('68', 287, 1, 17, 544569) What is her address?

('68', 288, 10, 29, 546317) God has been putting you to a severe test and you are going through it very well, which also is due to His grace.
('68', 288, 10, 30, 546431) There is a verse which we have been reciting here during the daily

('68', 289, 1, 2, 546540) prayers.

('68', 289, 1, 4, 546660) To forget God is adversity; ever to think to Him is prosperity.
('68', 289, 1, 5, 546724) It is good that Hira is with you.
('68', 289, 1, 6, 546758) Do write a few lines to me whenever you think it fit.
('68', 289, 1, 7, 546812) Are you at all likely to pay a visit to the country?
('68', 289, 1, 8, 546865) I am quite well, though perhaps I may not now be able to put in the amount of work I used to formerly.
('68', 289, 1, 9, 546968) I, of course, do need rest.

('68', 291, 3, 4, 549259) CHI.BACHUBHAI, Gangabehn has written to me about you.
('68', 291, 3, 5, 549313) I think that Vaidya Jugatram's advice to you is right.
('68', 291, 3, 6, 549368) For the present at any rate your diet should be milk and fruit.
('68', 291, 3, 7, 549432) You may take glucose with it.
('68', 291, 3, 8, 549462) At present it will be good not to take anythng made of when or other cereals.
('68', 291, 3, 9, 549540) In place of milk, you may take churned curds, which will be easier to digest and will cause no gas.
('68', 291, 3, 10, 549640) A healthy cow's milk if taken fresh soon after milking does not cause any gas; this may be taken in small quantities.
('68', 291, 3, 11, 549758) Instead of taking milk and fruit together, you should take them at intervals separtely.
('68', 291, 3, 12, 549846) For the present, take only juicy fruits, such as oranges, mosambis, grapes, pomegranate, pinapple and papaya.
('68', 291, 3, 13, 549956) Take care that the curds are not sour.
('68', 291, 3, 14, 549995) If Jugatram agrees, you would do well to take about ten bulbs of garlic.
('68', 291, 3, 15, 550068) Recently I have heard much about the good that garlic does.
('68', 291, 3, 16, 550128) It appears to help much in the digestion of milk.
('68', 291, 3, 17, 550178) Dr. Talvalkar's brother prepares an essence of garlic.
('68', 291, 3, 18, 550233) In my recent illness, I could take twenty five big bulbs of garlic a day.
('68', 291, 3, 19, 550307) I do not take them now as there is no need to do so.
('68', 291, 3, 20, 550360) One may add glucose to milk and to fruit juice.
('68', 291, 3, 21, 550408) Do not take buffalo's milk.
('68', 291, 3, 22, 550436) It is likely to prove heavy for you.
('68', 291, 3, 23, 550473) If you find even cow's milk heavy, have a goat at your place and take its milk.

('68', 291, 8, 28, 550627) RANCHHODLAL, Ever since I left Ahmedabad I have been intending to write to you but could not, as it was left out or forgotten at the time of writing the few letters that I am permitted.
('68', 291, 8, 29, 550813) Today, however, early in the morning I made a note of doing this.
('68', 291, 8, 30, 550879) The reason for the letter is the pain caused to Bhai Mavalankar, who had put his entire trust in you and held you in great respect.
('68', 291, 8, 31, 551011) Now, that confidence being no longer there, he writes to Sardar that you have yourself given him cause to

('68', 292, 1, 3, 551268) He feels aggrieved in the matter, has even begun doubting the purity of your motives, and repents that he put so much trust in you.
('68', 292, 1, 4, 551400) You should explain to me all that has happened, as Mavalankar writes that he helped you in the nick of time trustfully though several friends had warned him against you.
('68', 292, 1, 5, 551570) You should remove the doubts in Mavalankar's mind and see that you do not lose such an open hearted and disinterested friend as he.
('68', 292, 1, 6, 551702) You should not lose the faith your creditors put in you.
('68', 292, 1, 7, 551759) No matter if you have to turn a penniless beggar, you ought not to lose your credit for truthfulness.
('68', 292, 1, 8, 551861) I shall be waiting for your reply by return of post.
('68', 292, 1, 9, 551914) I hope Motibehn is doing well.

('68', 292, 8, 21, 552313) Tell him that I shall send him my opinion after finishing the reading.
('68', 292, 8, 22, 552384) It is exceedingly cold today and it is windy.
('68', 292, 8, 23, 552430) Dr. Ansari examined me today.The blood pressure was 156/94, but last evening it was higher.
('68', 292, 8, 24, 552522) The doctor, therefore, thinks that I should still be moderate in work and observe the restrictions.

('68', 293, 3, 4, 552925) JAYAPRAKASH,
('68', 293, 4, 5, 552938) I read your book carefully and liked it although the attack on me which it carries betrays considerable ignorance regarding me.
('68', 293, 4, 6, 553066) That can be removed but I am enchanted with your study.
('68', 293, 4, 7, 553122) after these preliminaries I may say that I find in it no remedy for our problem.
('68', 293, 4, 8, 553203) Your solution does not suit the conditions in this country at least for the present.
('68', 293, 4, 9, 553288) The goal you aim at is almost the same as that desired by me and many Congressmen.
('68', 293, 4, 10, 553371) But our method of attaining it differs from yours.
('68', 293, 4, 11, 553422) Your method in my opinion is not practicable in this country.
('68', 293, 4, 12, 553484) I am not so attached to my own method that I cannot see the merits of anyone else's.
('68', 293, 4, 13, 553569) But I am unable to appreciate your solution in spite of all sincere effort.
('68', 293, 4, 14, 553645) Your speech at the Bengal session had been travelling with me and I read it only today.
('68', 293, 4, 15, 553733) I like your resolution regarding the committee of experts.
('68', 293, 4, 16, 553792) Have you anyone in mind who can do justice to the work?
('68', 293, 4, 17, 553848) Have you taken any further step in this respect?
('68', 293, 4, 18, 553897) Your book has given rise to many thought with more to come but I cannot write anything just now on that topic.
('68', 293, 4, 19, 554008) Prabha writes that you are totally negligent of your health; this is not good.

('68', 295, 5, 10, 556369) 360. BIRTH CONTROL [I ]
('68', 295, 6, 11, 556393) A co worker 1 who is a careful reader of my writings was disturbed to read that I was likely to approve of the 'safe period' method of birth control.
('68', 295, 6, 12, 556543) I endeavoured to make it clear to the friend that the safe period method did not repel me as did the use of contraceptives and that it was open largely only to married couples.
('68', 295, 6, 13, 556720) But the discussion of the topic led us into much deeper waters than either of us had expected.
('68', 295, 6, 14, 556815) The fact that my friend was repelled by the safe period method as much as by that of contraceptives showed to me that he believed in the possibility of ordinary persons practising the restraint imposed by the smritis, i.e., that the union between husband and wife was permitted only when the parties really desired to have children.
('68', 295, 6, 15, 557148) Whilst I knew the rule I had never regarded it in the light that I began to do at the discussion.
('68', 295, 6, 16, 557246) All these long years I had regarded it as a counsel of perfection not to be carried out literally and that so long as married couples carried on intercourse by mutual consent but without special regard to the desire for progeny, they were carrying out the purpose of marriage without breaking any positive injunction of the smriti.
('68', 295, 6, 17, 557578) But the new light in which I viewed the smriti text was a revelation to me.
('68', 295, 6, 18, 557654) I understood now as I never had done before the statement that married people, who strictly observed the
('68', 295, 7, 19, 557759) 1 Vinoba Bhave
('68', 296, 0, 1, 557774) VOL. 68 : 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 297
('68', 296, 1, 2, 557820) injunction of the smritis, were as much brahmacharis as those who were never married and lived chaste lives.
('68', 296, 1, 3, 557929) The sole object of sexual intercourse according to the new light was the desire for progeny, never gratification of the sexual instinct.
('68', 296, 1, 4, 558066) Simple gratification of the instinct would be counted according to this view of marriage as lust.
('68', 296, 1, 5, 558164) This may appear to be a harsh expression to use for our enjoyment which has hitherto been regarded as innocent and legitimate.
('68', 296, 1, 6, 558291) But I am not dealing with custom.
('68', 296, 1, 7, 558325) I am dealing with the science of marriage as propounded by Hindu sages.
('68', 296, 1, 8, 558397) Their presentation may be faulty, it may be altogether wrong.
('68', 296, 1, 9, 558459) But for one like me who believes in several smriti texts as inspired and based on experience, there is no escape from a full acceptance of their meaning.
('68', 296, 1, 10, 558613) I know no other way of finding the truth of things and testing certain old texts in accordance with their full meaning no matter how hard the test may appear and how harsh its deductions may sound.
('68', 296, 1, 11, 558811) In the light of what I have said above, birth controls by contraceptives and the like is a profound error.
('68', 296, 1, 12, 558918) I write thus with a full sense of my responsibility.
('68', 296, 1, 13, 558971) I have great regard for Mrs. Margaret Sanger and her followers.
('68', 296, 1, 14, 559035) She impressed me much by her great zeal for her cause.
('68', 296, 1, 15, 559090) 1 I know that she has great sympathy for the women who suffer because they have to bear the burden of carrying and rearing unwanted children.
('68', 296, 1, 16, 559232) I know also that this method of birth control has the support of many Protestant divines, scientists, learned men and doctors, many of whom I have the hounour of knowing personally and for whom I entertain high regard.
('68', 296, 1, 17, 559451) But I should be false to my God who is Truth and nothing but Truth, if I concealed my belief from the reader or these great advocates of the method.
('68', 296, 1, 18, 559600) Indeed, if I hid my belief, I should never discover my error if my present belief is one.
('68', 296, 1, 19, 559690) Moreover, its declaration is due to those many men and women who accept my guidance and advice in many moral problems including this one concerning birth control.
('68', 296, 1, 20, 559853) That birth requires to be regulated and controlled is common cause between the advocates of contraceptives and the like.
('68', 296, 1, 21, 559974) The difficulty of control through self restraint is not to be denied.
('68', 296, 1, 22, 560044) Yet there is no other way of attaining the end, if mankind is to fulfil its destiny.
('68', 296, 1, 23, 560129) It is my innermost conviction that if the method under discussion gains universal acceptance, mankind will suffer moral

('68', 297, 1, 2, 560341) deterioration.
('68', 297, 1, 3, 560356) This I say in spite of the evidence to the contrary that is often produced by the advocates of the method.
('68', 297, 1, 4, 560463) I believe I have no superstition in me.
('68', 297, 1, 5, 560503) Truth is not truth merely because it is ancient.
('68', 297, 1, 6, 560552) Nor is it necessarily to be regarded with suspicion because it is ancient.
('68', 297, 1, 7, 560627) There are some fundamentals of life which cay not be lightly given up because they are difficult of enforcement in one's life.
('68', 297, 1, 8, 560754) Birth control through self control is no doubt difficult.
('68', 297, 1, 9, 560812) But no one has yet been known seriously to dispute its efficacy and even superiority over the use of contraceptives.
('68', 297, 1, 10, 560929) Then, I feel that full of acceptance of the implication of the injuction of the Shastras as to the strictly confined use of the sexual act makes the observance of self control much easier than if one regards the act itself as a source of supreme enjoyment.
('68', 297, 1, 11, 561186) The function of the organs of generation is merely to generate progeny obviously of the highest type possible for a married couple.
('68', 297, 1, 12, 561318) This can and should only take place when both parties desire, not sexual union but progeny which is the result of such union.
('68', 297, 1, 13, 561444) Desire for such union, therefore, without the desire for progeny, must be considered unlawful and should be restrained.
('68', 297, 1, 14, 561564) The possibility of such control for the ordinary man will be examined in the next issue.

('68', 300, 4, 5, 564785) I had your letter which prompted me to send for Draupadi and here is her reply.
('68', 300, 4, 6, 564865) But I have repeated my invitation.
('68', 300, 4, 7, 564900) You are gaining good experience.
('68', 300, 4, 8, 564933) It will be nice if you have nothing further to learn from any institution after you come here.

('68', 300, 7, 15, 565452) The diary must be filled in every day.
('68', 300, 7, 16, 565491) As we eat daily, so must we pray daily and fill in the diary.
('68', 300, 7, 17, 565553) Sometimes food has to be dispensed with but the diary is indispensable as long as we have any strength, and prayer too cannot be given up as long as the heart is pure.
('68', 300, 7, 18, 565721) If you start on garlic you will be totally relieved of wind and black pepper will become unnecessary.
('68', 300, 7, 19, 565823) Partaking of garlic and milk by way of medicine need not constitute a violation of brahmacharya.
('68', 300, 7, 20, 565920) In the case of the weak, the proclivity to passion tends to grow and also results in involuntary discharge.
('68', 300, 7, 21, 566028) Such men require milk and the like.
('68', 300, 7, 22, 566064) My opinion regarding milk as expressed in my Guide to Health 1
('68', 300, 8, 23, 566127) has certainly undergone some change.

('68', 301, 2, 3, 566458) DELHI, March 15, 1936
('68', 301, 3, 4, 566480) LILAVATI,
('68', 301, 4, 5, 566490) I read your letter to Mahadev.
('68', 301, 4, 6, 566521) You sound as if your staying in Maganwadi was a punishment.
('68', 301, 4, 7, 566581) If you have knowingly stayed there, you must consider it your duty to stay there like that.
('68', 301, 4, 8, 566673) One who follows religion with proper understanding always finds great joy before which other pleasures are insignificant.
('68', 301, 4, 9, 566795) Other pleasures cannot ever be called joys.
('68', 301, 4, 10, 566839) This joy does not depend on anything external.
('68', 301, 4, 11, 566886) Hence, outside worries cannot ever diminish that joy.
('68', 301, 4, 12, 566940) You will have passed the test only when you derive such joy from your pursuit of duty.
('68', 301, 4, 13, 567027) None of you is going to be inconvenienced if I can manage to go to Segaon.
('68', 301, 4, 14, 567102) But, as you say, when that if is removed, everything will fall in place.
('68', 301, 4, 15, 567175) Hence, instead of thinking about the future steps let one step be enough for the present.
('68', 301, 4, 16, 567265) Thus, you will find contentment.
('68', 301, 4, 17, 567298) When one step is taken, the next step will be right before you, is there any doubt about it?
('68', 301, 4, 18, 567391) I understand about the Kumarappa brothers.
('68', 301, 4, 19, 567434) It is sufficient that you have done your duty.

('68', 302, 7, 20, 568744) Krishnadass marriage.
('68', 302, 7, 21, 568766) Yesterday I remembered the decision which I had forgotten because of my change of place.
('68', 302, 7, 22, 568855) Such a marriage must be the consequence of the merits of the couple and their elders.
('68', 302, 7, 23, 568941) The ceremony was performed by a true Brahmin, Ravishankar Maharaj, amidst the blessings of numerous loving friends.
('68', 302, 7, 24, 569057) Instead of Krishnadas having to go to the place of the brides father, the latter came with his daughter to meet Krishnadas at his place of duty.
('68', 302, 7, 25, 569202) The bride wore a white sari woven from yarn spun by Krishnadas himself.
('68', 302, 7, 26, 569274) For other ornaments she had garlands of yarn spun by Kashi and me.
('68', 302, 7, 27, 569341) Vinoba, Krishnadass guru, was of course present, and the very next day the couple joined the guru in doing their work of service.
('68', 302, 7, 28, 569471) The bride did not have even a grain of gold as a wedding ring.
('68', 302, 7, 29, 569534) The expense on the wedding is not likely to have been even so much as two rupees.
('68', 302, 7, 30, 569616) I found the bride truly gentle.
('68', 302, 7, 31, 569648) Never had I witnessed such a wedding before.

('68', 305, 3, 5, 572584) MY DEAR SHUMMY, Amrit has given me your message and something more  her tears.
('68', 305, 3, 6, 572663) She felt most miserable as she was labouring through the message.
('68', 305, 3, 7, 572729) Amrit has told me so many things about your great love for her that I could and would not believe that a coolness had sprung up between you two and that too owing to my having entered Amrits life.
('68', 305, 3, 8, 572926) She tells me that my way of looking at life had begun of affect hers as early as 1915. For me her affection and co operation are a precious treasure.
('68', 305, 3, 9, 573076) But I want neither at the cost of abiding love between you two.
('68', 305, 3, 10, 573140) You alone, I am aware, have [stood] by her through thick and through thin.
('68', 305, 3, 11, 573215) My own connection with you all must, if anything, tighten that bond, never weaken it.
('68', 305, 3, 12, 573301) So you will tell me what you will have me to do.
('68', 305, 3, 13, 573350) This I can say that I shall never be guilty of weaning her from her present public activites.
('68', 305, 3, 14, 573444) I would love to make them purer, i.e., I would have her to work in a much more detached manner than she has hitherto done.
('68', 305, 3, 15, 573567) But in all my doings about Amrit, you shall be my guide.
('68', 305, 3, 16, 573624) If ever I differ from you I shall tell you.
('68', 305, 3, 17, 573668) But where the supreme good of Amrit is a common cause there can be no difference.
('68', 305, 3, 18, 573750) She is too tender a flower to be allowed to wither.

('68', 306, 3, 11, 574653) I am going very slowly and very cheerfully.

('68', 306, 3, 14, 574883) But our inference is based on probability.
('68', 306, 3, 15, 574926) Hence I think we should not worry about our own likes, or those of dear ones.
('68', 306, 3, 16, 575004) Mahadev has smelt in your letter a dislike for him.

('68', 307, 3, 6, 576144) As little expense as possible should be incurred in building the hut and in no case should it exceed Rs. 100. Whatever help I might need, I should obtain from Segaon.
('68', 307, 3, 7, 576311) I sould pay visits to Maganwadi as often as necessary.
('68', 307, 3, 8, 576366) For that I should use whatever vehicle I can get.

('68', 307, 3, 11, 576533) If necessary, Mahadev, Kanti and others might stay in the village.
('68', 307, 3, 12, 576600) For them a simple hut should be erected.
('68', 307, 3, 13, 576641) Along with this, I will continue my other outside activities.
('68', 307, 3, 14, 576703) Unless there is some special reason, people from outside should not come to see me at Segaon.
('68', 307, 3, 15, 576797) They may see me only at Maganwadi on the days fixed for my going there.
('68', 307, 3, 16, 576869) Whenever there is need for me to go out.

('68', 307, 4, 20, 577057) By doing this, full use could be made of Mirabehns great capacities.
('68', 307, 4, 21, 577126) And Mahadev, Kanti and others will also get a novel and good experience.
('68', 307, 4, 22, 577199) Whatever defects there may be in my way of thinking will come to the surface on my lving in a village.
('68', 307, 4, 23, 577302) Other people will, no doubt, get encouragement.

('68', 308, 12, 18, 578119) What you say about the well on Jamnalal Bajajs farm is disturbing 2. But it merely shows the tremendous difficulties we have in our way.
('68', 308, 12, 19, 578256) In the midst of all these you must keep well and calm, even as I am trying to do.
('68', 308, 12, 20, 578338) For you might imagine that it cannot all be plain sailing for me here.
('68', 308, 12, 21, 578409) I am having difficulty about the political part as also the village settlement part.
('68', 308, 12, 22, 578494) But according to Dr. Ansari my progress is steady and he wants me to undergo more physical and mental exertion to test my capacity.
('68', 308, 12, 23, 578626) And I am keeping calm.
('68', 308, 12, 24, 578649) Bood pressure was on 18th evening 154/92. I have to go to Lucknow on 28th to open [the] Exhibition.
('68', 308, 12, 25, 578749) I am then supposed to go to Wardha.
('68', 308, 12, 26, 578785) I do not know for certain what is going to happen after 28th.
('68', 308, 12, 27, 578847) But I shall soon know.

('68', 309, 7, 8, 579246) These recurring attacks of fever disturb me.
('68', 309, 7, 9, 579291) If you cannot keep well in villages, you must live in Maganwadi and do what you can from there.
('68', 309, 7, 10, 579387) You may not use violence against yourself.
('68', 309, 7, 11, 579430) Why do you not write about the difficulties there to Jamnalalji?
('68', 309, 7, 12, 579495) When I mentioned the well difficulty 1 to him, he resented having to know it through me.
('68', 309, 7, 13, 579584) He said the understanding was that you should let him know directly about all your difficulties.
('68', 309, 7, 14, 579681) Perhaps you will answer that that agreement was cancelled.
('68', 309, 7, 15, 579740) I would say not quite.
('68', 309, 7, 16, 579763) You are still bound so long as you atttend to Segaon to write to him directly.
('68', 309, 7, 17, 579842) That does not mean that you may not write to me.

('68', 310, 9, 20, 581124) I shall return from there on the 29th.
('68', 310, 9, 21, 581163) I expect I shall go to Wardha most probably.
('68', 310, 9, 22, 581208) Though I do not quite like it my life nowadays is spent in wanderings.
('68', 310, 9, 23, 581279) However, it may all be only to the good and perhaps I gather experience at any rate.
('68', 310, 9, 24, 581364) Do try to read Jayaprakashs book, though it is sure to be rendered into Hindi.
('68', 310, 9, 25, 581443) My talks with Jawaharlal are continuing and will, I believe, go on for some time more.
('68', 310, 9, 26, 581530) Dr. Ansari came to examine me again and expressed his satisfaction with the improvement in my health.

('68', 311, 8, 20, 582597) The result was that I never realized that the proposed conference 1 was to have three or four hundred invitees and that I was to preside over it.
('68', 311, 8, 21, 582743) Moreover, there is going to be a reception committee!
('68', 311, 8, 22, 582797) How can you involve me in all this?
('68', 311, 8, 23, 582833) I am still under orders not to do any such thing.
('68', 311, 8, 24, 582883) For my part, I took it that I was to sit in a small room for a little while and offer whatever suggestions might occur to me.
('68', 311, 8, 25, 583009) It is of course my fault that I did not understand things fully.
('68', 311, 8, 26, 583074) I admit it, but the admission is not the end of the matter for us.
('68', 311, 8, 27, 583141) Jamnalalji has been greatly surprised and even pained at this.
('68', 311, 8, 28, 583204) I undertook the responsibility of replying to the letter and sent a long telegram.

('68', 312, 4, 13, 584149) 387. BIRTH CONTROLII
('68', 312, 5, 14, 584170) There is nothing in our society today which would conduce to self control.
('68', 312, 5, 15, 584245) Our very upbringing is against it.
('68', 312, 5, 16, 584280) The primary concern of parents is to marry their children anyhow so that they may breed like rabbits.
('68', 312, 5, 17, 584382) If they are girls, they are married at as early an age as they conveniently can be, irrespective of their moral welfare.
('68', 312, 5, 18, 584503) The marriage ceremony is one longdrawn out agony of feasting and frivolity.
('68', 312, 5, 19, 584579) The householders life is in keeping with the past life.
('68', 312, 5, 20, 584635) It is a prolongation of self indulgence.
('68', 312, 5, 21, 584676) Holidays and social enjoyments are so arranged as to allow one the greatest latitude for sensuous living.
('68', 312, 5, 22, 584782) The literature that is almost thrust on one generally panders to the animal passion.
('68', 312, 5, 23, 584867) The most modern literatuee almost teaches that indulgence in it is a duty and total abstinence a sin.
('68', 312, 5, 24, 584969) Is it any wonder if control of the sexual appetite has become difficult if not almost impossible?
('68', 312, 5, 25, 585067) If then birth control through self restraint is the most desirable and sensible and totally harmless method, we must change the soical ideal and environment.
('68', 312, 5, 26, 585225) The only way to bring about the desired end is for individuals who believe in the method of self control to make the beginning themselves and with unqunenchable faith to affect their surroundings.
('68', 312, 5, 27, 585422) For them the conception of marriage I discussed 1 last week has, it seems to me, the greatest significance.
('68', 312, 5, 28, 585530) A proper grasp of it means a complete mental revolution.
('68', 312, 5, 29, 585587) It is not meant merely for a few select individuals.
('68', 312, 5, 30, 585640) It is presented as the law of the human species.
('68', 312, 5, 31, 585689) Its breach reduces the status of human beings and brings swift punishment in the shape of multiplicity of unwanted children, a train of ever increasing diseases

('68', 313, 1, 2, 585930) and disruption of man as a moral being responsbile to his Maker.
('68', 313, 1, 3, 585995) Birth control by contraceptives no doubt regulates to a certain extent the number of newcomers and enables persons of moderate means to keep the wolf from the door.
('68', 313, 1, 4, 586160) But the moral harm it does to the individual and society is incalculable.
('68', 313, 1, 5, 586234) For one thing, the outlook upon life for those who satisfy the sexual appetite for the sake of it is wholly changed.
('68', 313, 1, 6, 586351) Marriage ceases to be a sacrament for them.
('68', 313, 1, 7, 586395) It means a revaluation of the social ideals hitherto prized as a precious treasure.
('68', 313, 1, 8, 586479) No doubt this argument will make little appeal to those who regard the old ideals about marriage as a superstition.
('68', 313, 1, 9, 586595) My argument is only addressed to thsoe who regard marriage as a sacrament and woman not as an instrument of animal pleasure but as mother of man and trustee of the virtue of her progeny.
('68', 313, 1, 10, 586782) My experience of self control by fellow workers and myself confirms me in the view presented here.
('68', 313, 1, 11, 586881) It assumes overwhelming force from the discovery in a vivid light of the ancient conception of marriage.
('68', 313, 1, 12, 586986) For me brahmacharya in married life now assumes its natural and inevitable position and becomes as simple as the fact of marriage itslef.
('68', 313, 1, 13, 587124) Any other method of birth control seems useless and unthinkable.
('68', 313, 1, 14, 587189) Once the idea that the only and grand function of the sexual organ is generation possesses man and woman, union for any other purpose they will hold as criminal waste of the vital fluid and consequent excitement caused to man and woman as an equally criminal waste of precious energy.
('68', 313, 1, 15, 587474) It is now easy to understand why the scientists of old have put such great value upon the vital fluid and why they have insisted upon it strong transmutation into the highest form of energy for the benefit of society.
('68', 313, 1, 16, 587692) They boldly declare that one who has acquired a perfect control over his or her sexual energy strengthens the whole being, physical, mental and spiritual, and attains powers unattainable by any other means.
('68', 313, 1, 17, 587899) Let not the reader be disturbed by the absence of many or even any living specimen of such giant brahmacharis .
('68', 313, 1, 18, 588011) The brahmacharis we see about us today are very incomplete specimens.
('68', 313, 1, 19, 588081) At best they are aspirants who have acquired control over their bodies but not their minds.
('68', 313, 1, 20, 588173) They have not become proof against temptation.
('68', 313, 1, 21, 588220) This is not because brahmacharya is so difficult of attainment.
('68', 313, 1, 22, 588284) Social environ ment is against them, and the majority of those who are making an honest effort unknowingly isolate the control of the animal passion from all other passions, whereas the effort to be successful must include control over all the passions to which man is prey.

('68', 314, 1, 2, 588605) brahmacharya is not impossible of attainment by the average man and woman.
('68', 314, 1, 3, 588680) it must not be supposed that it requires less effort than that required by an average student who has set his heart upon becoming a master of any one of the sciences.
('68', 314, 1, 4, 588847) Attainment of brahmacharya in the sense here meant means mastery of the Science of Life.

('68', 314, 3, 6, 588955) 388. LIMITATION OF REFORMERS
('68', 314, 4, 7, 588984) Ever since Dr. Ambedkar has thrown his bomb shell in the midst of Hindu society in the shape of threatened conversion, frantic efforts have been made to wean him from the proposed step.
('68', 314, 4, 8, 589170) Dr. Ambedkars threat has had its repercussions on Harijans, too, who are at all literate and are able to read newspapers.
('68', 314, 4, 9, 589292) They have begun to approach Hindu institutions or reformers with a demand for posts, scholarships or the like, accompanying it with the statement that the writer might, in the event of refusal, be obliged to change to another faith, aid having been offered on behalf of the representatives of that faith.
('68', 314, 4, 10, 589597) Without a doubt these threats are a portent and a matter of grave concern to those who care at all for the religion of their forefathers.
('68', 314, 4, 11, 589735) But it will not be served by coming to terms with those who have lost faith in Hinduism or for that matter in any religion.
('68', 314, 4, 12, 589859) Religion is not a matter of barter.
('68', 314, 4, 13, 589895) It is a matter for every individual to decide for himself to which faith he will belong.
('68', 314, 4, 14, 589984) It does not lend itself to purchase in any shape or form.
('68', 314, 4, 15, 590042) Or if such an expression can be used in connection with things of the spirit, religion can only be purchased with ones own blood.
('68', 314, 4, 16, 590172) If therefore any Harijan wants to give up Hinduism, he should be entirely free to do so.
('68', 314, 4, 17, 590261) There must be a searching of heart for the reformer.
('68', 314, 4, 18, 590314) Has his practice or that of his neighbours caused the defection?
('68', 314, 4, 19, 590379) If it has and if it is found to be improper, it must be changed.
('68', 314, 4, 20, 590444) It is an admitted fact that the conduct of a vast number of Hindus who call themselves sanatanists is such as to cause the greatest inconvenience and irritation to the Harijans all over India.
('68', 314, 4, 21, 590637) The wonder is that many more Harijans than already have, have not left Hinduism.
('68', 314, 4, 22, 590718) It speaks volumes for their loyalty or for the innate virtue of Hinduism that millions of Harijans have clung to it in spite of the
('68', 315, 0, 1, 590850) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 316
('68', 315, 1, 2, 590892) inhumanities to which in the name of that very faith they have been subjectd.
('68', 315, 1, 3, 590970) This wonderful loyalty of Harijans and their unexampled patience render it imperative for every savarna Hindu to see that Harijans receive the same treatment that every other Hindu does.
('68', 315, 1, 4, 591157) The course before savarnas is, therefore, on the one hand not to interfere with Harijans wishing to leave the Hindu fold by trying to keep them within it by the offer of bribes in the shape of finding employment or scholarships and, on the other hand, to insist on full justice being done to Harijans in every walk of life.
('68', 315, 1, 5, 591481) Indeed reformers should anticipate the Harijansrequirements and not wait till they begin to complain.
('68', 315, 1, 6, 591583) The Harijan Sevak Sangh is the biggest institution for the removal of untouchability.
('68', 315, 1, 7, 591669) It has wisely adpoted a most liberal policy of giving scholarships to deserving students.
('68', 315, 1, 8, 591759) It employs as many Harijans as possible.
('68', 315, 1, 9, 591800) But it is in no sense a bureau for finding jobs for unemployed Harijans.
('68', 315, 1, 10, 591873) Generally speaking, there, is no dearth of jobs for Harijans who are fit for the jobs for which they offer themselves.
('68', 315, 1, 11, 591992) The greatest hardship felt by thousands of Harijans is want of pure water for drinking and domestic use, denial of access to public schools and other institutions, constant pinpricks in villages and, last but not least, denial of access to temples of worship.
('68', 315, 1, 12, 592252) These disabilities are stern realities in the lives of the vast mass of Harijans.
('68', 315, 1, 13, 592334) If they as a mass give up Hinduism, they will do so becasue of these common disabilities which brand them as lepers of Hindu society.
('68', 315, 1, 14, 592468) Hinduism is passing through a fiery ordeal.
('68', 315, 1, 15, 592512) It will perish not through individual conversions, not even through mass conversions, but it will perish because of the sinful denial by the so called savarna Hindus of elementary justice to Harijans.
('68', 315, 1, 16, 592713) Every threat of conversion is, therefore, a warning to the savarnas that if they do not wake up in time, it may be too late !
('68', 315, 1, 17, 592839) One word to the impatient and needy Harijans.
('68', 315, 1, 18, 592885) They must not use threats when they approach Hindu institutions or indviduals for help.
('68', 315, 1, 19, 592973) They should rely upon the strength of their case commanding a hearing.
('68', 315, 1, 20, 593044) The majority of Harijans do not know what change of religion can mean.
('68', 315, 1, 21, 593115) They mutely suffer the continuing degradation to which savarnas in their selfishness have consigned them.
('68', 315, 1, 22, 593221) They must be the primary care of Hindu reformers whether they complain or do not.
('68', 315, 1, 23, 593303) Those who are enlightened enough to know and feel the degradation and know also what change of religion means, are either
('68', 316, 0, 1, 593425) VOL. 68 : 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 317
('68', 316, 1, 2, 593471) too good Hindus to desert their ancestral faith and deserve every help they need, or being indifferent as to religion may not claim help from savarna Hindus in exhange for their condescending to remain in the Hindu fold.
('68', 316, 1, 3, 593692) I would, therefore, plead with enlightened Harijans for their own sakes not to seek material betterment under threat of conversion.
('68', 316, 1, 4, 593824) And whilst reformers must on no account yield to threats, they must ceaselessly strive to secure justice for Harijans at the hands of savarna Hindus.

('68', 316, 4, 7, 594020) DELHI, March 21, 1936
('68', 316, 5, 8, 594042) BHAI MUNSHI,
('68', 316, 6, 9, 594055) Jamnalalji was greatly surprised at Kaka's letter to him on the subject of the conference, and I got scared.
('68', 316, 6, 10, 594164) I have, therefore, sent Kaka a long telegram on behalf of Jamnalal but to your address.
('68', 316, 6, 11, 594252) I have also written to him.
('68', 316, 6, 12, 594280) 1 It would not be proper to expect a long speech from me.
('68', 316, 6, 13, 594338) I am not yet in a position to preside over such a large conference.
('68', 316, 6, 14, 594406) When I said yes, I imagined there would be just a handful of men attending and we would be exchanging a few thoughts with one another.
('68', 316, 6, 15, 594541) Your idea, it appears, is to have a gathering on a big scale.
('68', 316, 6, 16, 594603) It is of course my own fault that I did not gather full infomation in advance.
('68', 316, 6, 17, 594682) You may now do as you think fit.
('68', 316, 6, 18, 594715) Indeed, I like Rajendra Babu's suggestion.
('68', 316, 6, 19, 594758) 2 He himself may even attend the function, and perhaps Jawaharlal too would.
('68', 316, 6, 20, 594835) The latter may even agree to preside.
('68', 316, 6, 21, 594873) Why should you not have Kaka or someone else as Chairman of the Reception Committee?
('68', 316, 6, 22, 594958) If you hold the conference after the Hindi Sammelan and if they do have a Reception Committee, Jamnalalji might be available.
('68', 316, 6, 23, 595084) I hope you are both doing well.
('68', 316, 7, 24, 595116) Blessings from BAPU

('68', 317, 3, 5, 595367) Anxiety or thinking about youcall it what you likepersists every day.
('68', 317, 3, 6, 595437) I regard it as wrong that you should ignore your ailment.
('68', 317, 3, 7, 595495) You have many excellent qualities, but this disregard of the body is hard to reconcile with them.
('68', 317, 3, 8, 595593) You ought to make a manly effort to overcome your ailment.
('68', 317, 3, 9, 595652) It does not matter if you have given up the treatment of Gaurishankerbhai.

('68', 317, 3, 13, 595928) Try one thing for a week: take in two instalments, mixing it with your food, one tola of green garlic very finely crushed.
('68', 317, 3, 14, 596051) It indeed had excellent effect on me.
('68', 317, 3, 15, 596089) It helps greatly in eliminating viruses in the bodyin relieving one of gas.
('68', 317, 3, 16, 596165) This was the remedy prescribed by Dr. Ansari for Navin.
('68', 317, 3, 17, 596221) Green garlic, which is to be consumed along with the bulb and the stems and the leaves, should be washed clean before it is crushed.
('68', 317, 3, 18, 596354) It is meant not for imparting taste, but as medicine.

('68', 317, 7, 23, 596567) [March 22, 1936] 2
('68', 317, 8, 24, 596586) Rao Bahadur Rajah 3. .
('68', 317, 8, 25, 596609) discussed the Delimitation Committees recommendation which a Committee appointed by the Assembly had recently considered, and invited Ganhijis suggestions as to how to proceed further.
('68', 317, 9, 26, 596794) I am not in a position to reveal these suggestions.
('68', 317, 9, 27, 596846) Rao Bahadur Rajah was much exercised over the irresponsible talk of mass conversions and wondered if intensive religious propaganda among Harijans could not be undertaken.

('68', 318, 1, 2, 597171) the formation of bhajan parties to travel from cheri 1 to cheri singing bhajans and giving kathas 2, and wondered if the Sangh could not send some parties from the North.
('68', 318, 1, 3, 597342) Gandhiji said: Whilst parties could be sent from the North, there is no need for the South to depend on the North.
('68', 318, 1, 4, 597457) The South has its inexhaustible treasures of religious songs and it should be the easiest thing to organize bhajan parties from the province itself.
('68', 318, 1, 5, 597606) I have heard soul stirring bhajans of Thyagaraja, and Sjt.
('68', 318, 1, 6, 597665) Rajagopalachari and Dr. Rajan would give you many a tip in this behalf.
('68', 318, 1, 7, 597737) For Malabar you connot think of a better guide than the poet Vallathol Narayana Menon.
('68', 318, 1, 8, 597824) I assure you there is a lot of musical talent even among Harijan boys of which we have not availed ourselves.
('68', 318, 1, 9, 597934) During the Harijan tour in Bhavnagar 3 I came across a Harijan boy who kept audiences spellbound by his simple songs.
('68', 318, 1, 10, 598052) In her indigenous kindergarten school 4 for Harijan children Anasuyabehn has an infant prodigy who wields his tabors as an expert and she has equally good songsters.
('68', 318, 1, 11, 598218) Dr. Ambedkar has every reason to be bitter for he has had to suffer humiliations and insults which should make anyone of us bitter and resentful.
('68', 318, 1, 12, 598364) If it is permitted to be bitter and to vent ones wrath, there is no reason why he should not do so.
('68', 318, 1, 13, 598464) What he fails in my opinion to realize is that it is not the fault fo Hinduism but of Hindus.
('68', 318, 2, 14, 598558) RAJAH: But has he to suffer those humiliations even now?
('68', 318, 2, 15, 598615) Those must be a thing of the past.
('68', 318, 3, 16, 598650) GANDHIJI: Those particular humiliations are a thing of the past, but even now he would not be welcomed in an orthodox Brahmins house.
('68', 318, 4, 17, 598784) R. But why should he want to enter an orthodox Brahmins house?
('68', 318, 5, 18, 598847) G. It is not that he wants to enter it, but he resents the attitude.
('68', 318, 5, 19, 598916) Even that refusal he would not resent if the rest of the savrnas were on their best behaviour.
('68', 318, 5, 20, 599011) Thus if an orthodox Hindu minister were to invite a number of Hindus, including Dr. Ambedkar, to dinner, and if he discriminated agianst the Doctor by asking him to sit apart, it is the duty of the rest of the Hindus to leave that house along with Dr.

('68', 319, 1, 3, 599419) If we all did so Dr. Ambedkar would easily feel like one of us.
('68', 319, 2, 4, 599483) R. I see.
('68', 319, 2, 5, 599493) But, Mahatmaji, we have made rapid strides and we shall see the end of it.
('68', 319, 3, 6, 599568) G. There is no doubt.
('68', 319, 3, 7, 599590) The monster of untouchability has been laid low, only he is so huge that even whilst he is in his death throes he is capable of much mischief.
('68', 319, 3, 8, 599733) But I cherish the dream when every one of the Harijans will be ransomed and brought up to the same levels as the tallest among the so called high class Hindus.
('68', 319, 3, 9, 599893) Dr., Ambedkar once pointedly asked me if when untouchability was removed the highest status that persons like him aspired to would be that of a Shudra.
('68', 319, 3, 10, 600045) I said to him that if he would be classed as a shudra evey other Hindu would also be so regarded.
('68', 319, 3, 11, 600143) Varna today has become a means of arrogating to oneself a higher status.
('68', 319, 3, 12, 600216) The real varna of my conception does not exist today.
('68', 319, 3, 13, 600270) In the purest type of Hinduism a Brahmin, an ant, an elephant and a dog eater (shvapaka) are of the same status.
('68', 319, 4, 14, 600383) And because our philosophy is so high, and we have failed to live up to it, that very philosophy today stinks in our nostrils.
('68', 319, 4, 15, 600510) Hinduism insists on the brotherhood not only of all mankind but of all that lives.
('68', 319, 4, 16, 600593) It is a conception which makes one giddy, but we have to work up to it.
('68', 319, 4, 17, 600665) The moment we have restored real living equality between man and man, we shall be able to establish equality between man and the whole creation.
('68', 319, 4, 18, 600810) When that day comes we shall have peace on earth and goodwill to men.
('68', 319, 5, 19, 600880) Rao Bahadur Rajah wondered if under the new Constitution the Harijans might identify themselves with any of the Partiesthe Congress Party, the Justice Party and
('68', 319, 6, 20, 601041) Gandhiji.
('68', 319, 6, 21, 601051) said: You must not identify yourselves with any party.
('68', 319, 6, 22, 601106) My views about the existing system of government have not changed, but with the peculiar disabilities that you have suffered for ages I would not expect you to identify yourselves even with the most forward party in India.
('68', 319, 6, 23, 601329) You will accept whatever is given you by Government, but you will not sacrifice your self respect.
('68', 319, 6, 24, 601428) You will similarly endorse whatever is good in the Congress programme, e.
('68', 319, 6, 25, 601502) g., prohibition, abolition of the salt tax, and say to the world that you would not allow the Harijans to be in any way isolated from the poor of India whose interests are identical with yours.

('68', 320, 4, 8, 602055) MIRA, Your letter disturbs me in more senses than one.
('68', 320, 4, 9, 602110) You are not yet well.
('68', 320, 4, 10, 602132) If life in Segaon does not suit you, you must leave in time and not as you had not in Bihar where there was a collapse.
('68', 320, 4, 11, 602252) I may or may not know my limits.
('68', 320, 4, 12, 602285) But you certainly do need to be cautioned, again and again .
('68', 320, 4, 13, 602346) You must not become a wreck.
('68', 320, 4, 14, 602375) And may this illness again be due to separation from me, though this time there are no such antecedent circumstances as there were last time.
('68', 320, 4, 15, 602517) Re read your letter to me; you have kept a copy.
('68', 320, 4, 16, 602566) It will be terrible if it needs revision.
('68', 320, 4, 17, 602608) But terrible or not, if there is the need, it must be revised.
('68', 320, 4, 18, 602671) Only one thing must not happen and that is living with me for personal service.
('68', 320, 4, 19, 602751) In my opinion you should be able joyfully to carry out the present understanding which is in no way arrived at under pressure of any kind whatsoever.
('68', 320, 4, 20, 602901) Let the mere fact of my mention of this thing not disturb you.
('68', 320, 4, 21, 602964) I would not have discussed this at all except for the fact my stay here is being unavoidably prolonged and I do not know how long it will be.
('68', 320, 4, 22, 603106) It wont be beyond the middle of April in any case and it wont be earlier than 7th April.
('68', 320, 4, 23, 603195) I am booked up to 5th April.
('68', 320, 4, 24, 603224) Yes, do not believe Press resports.
('68', 320, 4, 25, 603260) Dr. Ansari is giving me more and more latitude daliy.
('68', 320, 4, 26, 603314) He found me last night fitter than I was four days ago.
('68', 320, 4, 27, 603370) He now wants me to walk for one hour at a stretch twice daily and undertake greater mental strain.
('68', 320, 4, 28, 603469) He is trying to test the extreme of my capacity for physical and mental exertion.
('68', 320, 4, 29, 603551) I have written many letters today besides an article for Harijan.
('68', 320, 4, 30, 603617) The weather all over India is very funny this year.

('68', 324, 1, 2, 607311) 400. DISCUSSION WITH HARIJAN SEVAKS 1
('68', 324, 2, 3, 607349) [March 27, 1936] 2
('68', 324, 3, 4, 607368) HARIJAN SEVAKS 3: We received our inspiration from Swami Shraddhanandji.
('68', 324, 4, 5, 607441) GANDHIJI: Not only you, but many of us received inspiration from the noble life of the late Swamiji.
('68', 324, 5, 6, 607542) Why dont you take some steps to counteract the vicious propaganda of the
('68', 324, 6, 7, 607615) missionaries?
('68', 324, 6, 8, 607629) Why not have Hindu missionaries for counter propaganda?
('68', 324, 6, 9, 607685) 4 Of course,
('68', 324, 7, 10, 607698) Mahatmaji, you are there enough to cover the whole field.
('68', 324, 7, 11, 607756) But pracharaks are needed.
('68', 324, 7, 12, 607783) Let me explain to you.
('68', 324, 7, 13, 607806) The Sangh was not created for that purpose.
('68', 324, 7, 14, 607850) Our object was to end the disabilities of Harijans and to put them on the same social level as the rest of the Hindus.
('68', 324, 7, 15, 607969) As for propaganda that you have in mind, the best propaganda is that of personal example.
('68', 324, 7, 16, 608059) Let every Harijan sevak lead a model life of purity and simplicity, clothe the Harijans with love and, I am quite sure, no counter propaganda will be necessary.
('68', 324, 8, 17, 608220) But there are places where the missionaries rush to the scene, do nothing but provide a few amenities like a water pipe or a good road and make the recipients declare that they are Christians.
('68', 324, 8, 18, 608413) The poor recipients often do so, but beyond the declaration they do nothing.
('68', 324, 8, 19, 608490) They share in the life of their Harijan brethren, celebrate the same Hindu festivals, and remian Hindus in every respect, except perhaps for census purposes.
('68', 324, 8, 20, 608648) They will remain Harijans and even the missions will not set much store by them.
('68', 324, 8, 21, 608729) Our duty is to work hard amongst the orthodox Hindus and to get them to admit the Harijans in their fold as their kith and kin and to end the disabilities they suffer from.
('68', 324, 9, 22, 608902) But how are we to persuade the orthodox?
('68', 324, 9, 23, 608943) May we storm their fortresses?
('68', 324, 9, 24, 608974) There are local board wells, for instance, which have been thrown open to the Harijans but the orthodox people will not allow them to use them.
('68', 324, 9, 25, 609118) May we advise the Harijans to defy the opposition and challenge them to do their worst?
('68', 324, 9, 26, 609206) You might, where you are fearless and where you are sure that
('68', 324, 10, 27, 609268) 1 The workers, including some Harijans, met Gandhiji on the last day of his stay in Delhi i.e., March 27 2 ibid 3 Those who belonged to the Arya Samaj 4 Propaganda workers
('68', 325, 0, 1, 609440) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 326
('68', 325, 1, 2, 609482) there will be no clash and that the Harijans will not be cowed down.
('68', 325, 1, 3, 609551) But the opposition is melting away gradually everywhere and I trust no storming will be necessary.
('68', 325, 2, 4, 609650) When untouchability is no more, Mahatmaji, what varna will you assign to us?
('68', 325, 2, 5, 609727) Who am I to assign a varna to you?
('68', 325, 2, 6, 609762) But if I had the power, I should declare that we are Hindus, all of the same varna.
('68', 325, 2, 7, 609846) As I have made it clear over and over again there is no real varna today.
('68', 325, 2, 8, 609920) When we have come to our own, when we have cleansed ourselves, we may have the four varnas according to the way in which we can express the best in us.
('68', 325, 2, 9, 610072) But varna then will invest no one with a superior status or right, it will invest one with higher responsibility and duties.
('68', 325, 2, 10, 610197) Those who will impart knowledge in a spirit of service will be called Brahmins.
('68', 325, 2, 11, 610277) They will assume no superior airs but will be true servents of society.
('68', 325, 2, 12, 610349) When ineqaulity of status or rights is ended, every one of us will be equal.
('68', 325, 2, 13, 610426) I do not know, however, when we sahll be able to revive true varnadharma.
('68', 325, 2, 14, 610500) Its real revival would mean true democracy.
('68', 325, 3, 15, 610544) What we want today is not that the caste Hindus eat with us or have marital ties with us.
('68', 325, 3, 16, 610634) We want rights of true citizenship, equal opportunities.
('68', 325, 3, 17, 610691) I want my son to have the liberty to be a vakil or a barrister or a doctor according to his own wish You know there is no legal bar against your son being anything he likes.
('68', 325, 3, 18, 610865) There is custom, hard prejudice and blind superstition.
('68', 325, 3, 19, 610921) That the Snagh is trying its best to fight.
('68', 325, 3, 20, 610965) Dr. Ambedkar is a barrister and now a professor.
('68', 325, 3, 21, 611014) But blind orthodoxy will not treat him as equal with the savarnas.
('68', 325, 3, 22, 611081) You cannot force them by legal enactment.
('68', 325, 3, 23, 611123) You can do it by education, by converting the orthodox.
('68', 325, 3, 24, 611179) There was, for instance, a Harijan who used to sell bidis in Nasik.
('68', 325, 3, 25, 611247) So long as no one knew that he was a Harijan, he had very good custom.
('68', 325, 3, 26, 611318) The moment they came to know that he was Harijan, they stopped pruchasing bidis at his shop, How are we to compel people to purchase bidis at his shop, otherwise than by showing them that it is inhuman and irreligious of them to boycott anybody by reason of his birth?
('68', 325, 4, 27, 611587) But why should we be called Harijans and not Hindus?
('68', 325, 4, 28, 611640) I know that a small section of you resents the name.
('68', 325, 4, 29, 611693) But you may know the genesis of the name.
('68', 325, 4, 30, 611735) You used to be called depressed classes or asprishyas or achhoots (untouchables).
('68', 325, 4, 31, 611817) All these names the vast mass of you naturally resented.
('68', 325, 4, 32, 611874) Some of you sent their protests to me and asked me to find out a better name.
('68', 325, 4, 33, 611952) In English I
('68', 326, 0, 1, 611965) VOL. 68 : 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 327
('68', 326, 1, 2, 612011) had adopted a better word than depressed, viz., suppressed, but whilst I was casting about for a good Indian word a friend suggested the word Harijan taken from the song of one of the best of our saints 1. It appealed to me because it best described your condition and still had no bad odour about it.
('68', 326, 1, 3, 612313) It means a devotee of God, and as God is the help of the helpless, and as it is the helpless who naturally turn to God, I thought you deserved the name better than I for instance.
('68', 326, 1, 4, 612493) For whilst I have to aspire to become a Harijan you are Harijans in the very nature of things.
('68', 326, 1, 5, 612588) But you will say, When your objective is to make Harijans Hindus why dont you start by calling them Hindus straightaway? What am I to do so long as I have not succeeded in abolishing untouchability?
('68', 326, 2, 6, 612787) But today, sir, it is an opprobrious term.
('68', 326, 2, 7, 612830) There is a Brahmin who threatens to hammer us if we call him a Harijan.
('68', 326, 2, 8, 612902) Then he is no Brahmin.
('68', 326, 2, 9, 612925) You know the word Harijan occurs in Tulsidass Ramayana?
('68', 326, 2, 10, 612981) There Lakshmana describes to Parashurama the characteristic of a true Kshatriya.
('68', 326, 2, 11, 613062) He says:
('68', 326, 3, 12, 613071) (It is the trait of our clan never to use force towards a god, a Brahimin, a Harijan or a cow.) Harijan there means a man of God, a devotee, no matter to what caste or varna he belongs.
('68', 326, 3, 13, 613257) We all have to treasure the beautiful connotation of the word and try to be worthy of the name.
('68', 326, 3, 14, 613353) One more question.
('68', 326, 3, 15, 613372) You call your Sangh Harijan Sevak Sangh. You are unnecessarily exploiting our name.
('68', 326, 3, 16, 613456) Fourteen annas in the rupee expended by the Harijan Sevak Sangh goes into the pockets of non Harijans, 2 annas barely goes into the pockets of the poor Harijans.
('68', 326, 3, 17, 613618) Now, now, there you are betraying gross ignorance.
('68', 326, 3, 18, 613669) I can prove to you the reverse of what you say.
('68', 326, 3, 19, 613717) Have you got any proof in support of your statement?
('68', 326, 3, 20, 613770) I make you a sporting offer.
('68', 326, 3, 21, 613799) If you can prove what you say, you can come to Wardha, at the Sanghs expense, with all the evidence in your possession, and if you succeed in convincing me I shall declare myself beaten and do proper penance.
('68', 326, 3, 22, 614008) In case you fail, I will not ask you to pay back to me the train fare.
('68', 326, 3, 23, 614079) But I will expect you to publicly apologize for bringing a baseless charge against the Sangh.
('68', 326, 3, 24, 614173) The Sanghs books are there open to inspection by anyone, and I tell you the books will convince you that

('68', 327, 0, 1, 614322) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 328
('68', 327, 1, 2, 614364) the truth is the reverse of what you say.
('68', 327, 1, 3, 614406) There is one thing certainly that you can prove.
('68', 327, 1, 4, 614455) It is that there are a few sevaks who are paid even as much as a hundred rupees per month.
('68', 327, 1, 5, 614546) But where that is the case, through such a sevak we distribute thousands to Harijans.
('68', 327, 1, 6, 614632) Also he who is being paid a hundred rupees could easily earn in the market much more than what he receives.
('68', 327, 1, 7, 614740) I am ready to confess, too, that, there are some who have to be paid as much as their market value but if no volunteer workers are available, or if you cannot get the services of the present staff on better terms, what can be done?
('68', 327, 1, 8, 614972) I can, however, assure you that our administrative charges do not exceed 15 per cent, and the balance goes for the benefit of the Harijans.
('68', 327, 2, 9, 615112) Harijan, 4 4 1936
('68', 327, 3, 10, 615130) 401. TEMPLE ENTRY
('68', 327, 4, 11, 615148) The reader will recall the important resolution 2 on temple entry passed recently by the Harijan Sevak Sangh.
('68', 327, 4, 12, 615258) No one need run away with the idea that because not much is nowadays heard of the questions it has been forgotten or given up by the Sangh.
('68', 327, 4, 13, 615398) Pandit Malaviyajis visit to Nasik and the vast audiences that gathered round him show that the people as a whole are not averse to the removal of untouchability, though it showed also that orthodoxy was not yet prepared to give up its untouchability.
('68', 327, 4, 14, 615649) But it is not possible to await developments.
('68', 327, 4, 15, 615695) The local Sanghs should make a sustained effort to have the existing temples thrown open and even to build new ones, not for Harijans only but for all.
('68', 327, 4, 16, 615847) If they are situated in healthy localities and have a school, a meeting place and a dharmashala attached to them, they must prove useful and popular among all classes of Hindus.
('68', 327, 4, 17, 616025) There may be public prayers held there every evening or at
('68', 327, 5, 18, 616084) 1 Harijans who were present at the meeting repudiated the suggestion and admitted that the bulk of the funds went into Harijans pockets.
('68', 327, 5, 19, 616221) 2 At the annual meeting held in Delhi from February 6 to 8. It read: Since any further delay in securing temple entry for Harijans will result in great harm to Hindu dharma, and since such temple entry is part of the immediate justice to which the Harijans are entitled, the Central Board of the All India Harijan Sevak Sangh resolves that effective steps be taken immediately for achieving temple entry for Harijans and, with a view to achieving this purpose, the Executive Committee be asked to take necessary steps in consultation with Gandhiji.

('68', 328, 1, 2, 616816) stated periods and religious discourses may be occasionally arranged.
('68', 328, 1, 3, 616886) If these temples are properly conducted, they would go a long way towards removing the prejudice against the opening of existing temples to Harijans.
('68', 328, 1, 4, 617036) Care must be taken, where temples are opened to Harijans, that no discrimination is made against them.
('68', 328, 1, 5, 617139) They must be opened on precisely the same terms as they are opened to the other Hindus.
('68', 328, 1, 6, 617227) It is hardly necessary to state that in different localities different methods may be adopted for securing the desired end.
('68', 328, 1, 7, 617351) Perfect non violence must of course be maintained in all cases.
('68', 328, 1, 8, 617415) An all India simultaneous movement of the same type is not contemplated.
('68', 328, 1, 9, 617488) It will vary in intensity and method according to the circumstances in each locality.
('68', 328, 1, 10, 617574) Nowhere should temples be opened where there is an active minority opposed to the opening.
('68', 328, 1, 11, 617665) Practical unanimity should be secured before any temple is opened.
('68', 328, 1, 12, 617732) Thus what is required is sustained effort to convert local public opinion in favour of temple entry.
('68', 328, 1, 13, 617833) The position in the Hindu States is somewhat different.
('68', 328, 1, 14, 617889) Where the Prince or his officials are favourably inclined, there should be no difficulty about opening them.
('68', 328, 1, 15, 617998) The question has assumed a great importance in Travancore.
('68', 328, 1, 16, 618057) In most other places Harijans are indiffernt about temple entry.
('68', 328, 1, 17, 618122) The position is otherwise in Travancore.
('68', 328, 1, 18, 618163) The vast majority of Harijans of that State are far more advanced then in other places.
('68', 328, 1, 19, 618251) They have many men belonging to the learned professions.
('68', 328, 1, 20, 618308) Many have passed through colleges.
('68', 328, 1, 21, 618343) They naturally chafe under any restriction of their liberty but most of all on the entry into temples.
('68', 328, 1, 22, 618446) One hears that the large body of savarnas there are wholly in favour of the removal of the bar.
('68', 328, 1, 23, 618542) Travancore has an enlightened Prince and an enlightened Maharani.
('68', 328, 1, 24, 618608) Surely the opposition of a few orthodox persons, however influential they may be in their own spheres, cannot be allowed to prevent a much needed reform which has become long overdue.
('68', 328, 1, 25, 618792) But Harijan sevaks should by an accurate referendum or some such means show beyond all doubt that a great majority of savarna Hindus are decidedly in favour of the opening of Travancore temples to Harijans precisely on the same terms as themselves.
('68', 328, 1, 26, 619041) The Maharaja may not march in advance of the public opinion of his State, but I can hardly imagine his flouting clearly expressed public opinion.

('68', 329, 2, 3, 619267) It is the fashion in some quarters nowadays for the young to discredit whatever may be said by old people.
('68', 329, 2, 4, 619374) I am not prepared to say that there is absolutely no justification for this belief.
('68', 329, 2, 5, 619458) But I warn the youth of the country against always discounting whatever old men or women may say for the mere fact that it is said by such persons.
('68', 329, 2, 6, 619606) Even as wisdom often comes from the mouths of babes, so does it often come from the mouths of old people.
('68', 329, 2, 7, 619712) The golden rule is to test everything in the light of reason and experience, no matter from whom it comes.
('68', 329, 2, 8, 619819) I want to revert to the subject of birth control by contraceptives.
('68', 329, 2, 9, 619887) It is dinned into ones ears that gratification of the sex urge is a solemn obigation like the obligation of discharging debts lawfully incurred, and that not to do so would involve the penalty of intellectual decay.
('68', 329, 2, 10, 620103) This sex urge has been isolated from the desire for progeny, and it is said by the protagonists of the use of contraceptives that conception is an accident to be prevented except when the parties desire to have children.
('68', 329, 2, 11, 620324) I venture to suggest that this is a most dangerous doctrine to preach anywhere; much more so in a country like India where the middle class male population has become imbecile through abuse of the creative function.
('68', 329, 2, 12, 620540) If satisfaction of the sex urge is a duty, the unnatural vice of which I wrote 1 some time ago and several other ways of gratification would be commendable.
('68', 329, 2, 13, 620697) The reader should know that even persons of note have been known to approve of what is commonly know as sexual perversion.
('68', 329, 2, 14, 620820) He may be shocked at the statement.
('68', 329, 2, 15, 620856) But if it somehow or other gains the stamp of respectability, it will be the rage among boys and girls to satisfy their urge among members of their own sex.
('68', 329, 2, 16, 621013) For me the use of contraceptives is not far removed from the means to which persons have hitherto resorted for the gratification of their sexual desire with results that very few know.
('68', 329, 2, 17, 621198) I know what havoc secret vice has played among schoolboys and schoolgirls.
('68', 329, 2, 18, 621273) The introuduction of contra ceptives under the name of science and imprimatur of known leaders society has intensified the complication and made the task of reformers who work for purity of social life well nigh impossible for the moment.
('68', 329, 2, 19, 621512) I betray no confidence when I inform the reader that

('68', 330, 1, 2, 621685) there are unmarried girls of impressionable age studying in schools and colleges who study birth control literature and magazines with avidity and even possess contraceptives.
('68', 330, 1, 3, 621861) It is impossible to confine their use to married women.
('68', 330, 1, 4, 621917) Marriage loses its sanctity when its purpose and highest use is conceived to be the satisfaction of the animal passion without contemplating the natural result of such satisfaction.
('68', 330, 1, 5, 622099) I have no doubt that those learned men and women who are carrying no propaganda with missionary zeal in favour of the use of contraceptives are doing irreparable harm to the youth of the country under the false belief that they will be saving thereby the poor women who may be obliged to bear children against their will.
('68', 330, 1, 6, 622421) Those who need to limit their children will not be easily reached by them.
('68', 330, 1, 7, 622496) Our poor women have not the knowledge or the training that the women of the West have.
('68', 330, 1, 8, 622583) Surely the propaganda is not being carried on on behalf of the middle class women, for they do not need the knowledge, at any rate so much as the poor classes do.
('68', 330, 1, 9, 622746) The greatest harm, however, done by that propaganda lies in its rejection of the old ideal and substitution in its place of one which, if carried out, must spell the moral and physical extinction of the race.
('68', 330, 1, 10, 622955) The horror with which ancient literature has regarded the fruitless use of the vital fluid was not a superstition born of ignorance.
('68', 330, 1, 11, 623088) What shall we say of a husbandmanwho will sow the finest seed in his possession on stony ground or of the owner of a field who will receive in his field rich with fine soil good seed under conditions that will make it impossible for it to grow?
('68', 330, 1, 12, 623333) God has blessed man with seed that has the highest potency and woman with a field richer than the richest earth to be found anywhere on this globe.
('68', 330, 1, 13, 623481) Surely it is criminal folly for man to allow his most precious possession to run to waste.
('68', 330, 1, 14, 623572) He must guard it with a care greater than he will bestow upon the richest pearls in his possession.
('68', 330, 1, 15, 623672) And so is a woman guilty of criminal folly who will receive the seed in her life producing field with the deliberate intention of letting it run to waste.
('68', 330, 1, 16, 623827) Both he and she will be judged guilty of misuse of the telents given to them and they will be dispossessed of what they have been given.
('68', 330, 1, 17, 623964) Sex urge is a fine and noble thing.
('68', 330, 1, 18, 624000) There is nothing to be ashamed of in it.
('68', 330, 1, 19, 624041) But it is meant only for the act of creation.
('68', 330, 1, 20, 624087) Any other use of it is a sin against God and humanity.
('68', 330, 1, 21, 624142) Contraceptives of a kind there were before and there will be hereafter, but the use of them was formerly regarded as sinful.
('68', 330, 1, 22, 624267) It was reserved for our generation to glorify vice by calling it virtue.
('68', 331, 0, 1, 624340) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 332
('68', 331, 1, 2, 624382) The greatest disservice protagonists of contraceptives are rendering to the youth of India is to fill their minds with what appears to me to be wrong ideology.
('68', 331, 1, 3, 624542) Let the young men and women of India who hold her destiny in their hands beware of this false god and guard the treasure with which God has blessed them and use it, if they wish, for the only purpose for which it is intended.

('68', 331, 4, 6, 624853) March 28, 1936
('68', 331, 5, 7, 624868) I am glad and thankful to be able to come to Lucknow to open this khadi and other village industries exhibition.
('68', 331, 5, 8, 624981) I may tell you that I was eager to be here at the opening.
('68', 331, 5, 9, 625040) Though I know that Dr. Murarilal and Sjt.
('68', 331, 5, 10, 625082) Shankerlal Banker have devoted themselves heart and soul to organizing it, at the back of it all was my conception.
('68', 331, 5, 11, 625198) This exhibition, to my mind, brings out concretely for the first time the conception of a true rural exhibition I have nursed in my breast for several years.
('68', 331, 5, 12, 625356) In 1921 when we met in Ahmedabad in the first year of the new Congress Constitution, we took the first step towards rural mindedness, and the exhibition organized under the auspices of the Congress held there was the beginning of the process which you find reaching its maturity today after 15 years.
('68', 331, 5, 13, 625657) I have believed and repeated times without number that India is to be found not in its few cities but in its 7, 00, 000 villages.
('68', 331, 5, 14, 625787) But we who have gathered here are not villagers.
('68', 331, 5, 15, 625836) We are town dwellers.
('68', 331, 5, 16, 625858) We town dwellers have believed that India is to be found in its towns and that the villages were created to minister to our needs.
('68', 331, 5, 17, 625989) We have hardly ever paused to inquire of those poor folks get sufficient to eat and clothe themselves with and whether they have a roof to shelter themselves from sun and rain.
('68', 331, 5, 18, 626166) Now I do not think any Congress worker has travelled through the length and breadth of India as much as I have done during the past twenty years.
('68', 331, 5, 19, 626312) That in itself is hardly thing to be proud of.
('68', 331, 5, 20, 626359) I, however, humbly claim, as a result of those peregrinations, to know the Indian villages more than any other Congress worker or leader.
('68', 331, 5, 21, 626497) I have found that the town dweller has generally exploited the villager, in fact he has lived on the poor villagers substance.
('68', 331, 5, 22, 626624) Many a British official has written about the
('68', 331, 6, 23, 626670) 1 This appeared under the title A Unique Exhibition.
('68', 332, 0, 1, 626723) VOL. 68 : 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 333
('68', 332, 1, 2, 626769) conditions of the people of India.
('68', 332, 1, 3, 626804) No one has, to my knowledge, said that the Indian villager has enough to keep body and soul together.
('68', 332, 1, 4, 626906) On the contrary they have admitted that the bulk of the population live on the verge of starvation and ten per cent are semi starved, and that millions have to rest content with a pinch of dirty salt and chillies and polished rice or parched grain.
('68', 332, 1, 5, 627155) You may be sure that if any of us were to be asked to live on that diet, we should not expect of survive it longer than a month or should be afraid of losing our mental faculties.
('68', 332, 1, 6, 627335) And yet our villagers go through that state from day to day.
('68', 332, 1, 7, 627396) The Village Industries Association was formed last year 1 in order to study the conditions in which they lived and the state of their handicrafts, and to revive such village arts and crafts as may be revived.
('68', 332, 1, 8, 627605) Simultaneously with the creation of the A.I.V.I. Association was passed a resolution 2 to the effect that future exhibitions should be organized by the Spinners and the Village Industries Associations.
('68', 332, 1, 9, 627807) This exhibition I am about to declare open today is the first of that kind.
('68', 332, 1, 10, 627883) As I have told you the whole conception here is mine, and yet I must confess that we are still far from bringing out that conception fully.
('68', 332, 1, 11, 628023) It is an evidence of the organizers wonderful industry, and yet it is not perfect of its kind.
('68', 332, 1, 12, 628118) It was not humanly possible to achieve it during the time at their disposal.
('68', 332, 1, 13, 628195) It is no easy job to bring village artisans form their villages.
('68', 332, 1, 14, 628260) You will find here villagers from South India who perhaps dont know where they have come to.
('68', 332, 1, 15, 628353) It is the purpose of this Exhibition to show that even this starving India of the villages is capable of producing things which we town dwellers may use both to the villagers and our advantage.
('68', 332, 1, 16, 628547) This exhibition is not a spectacular show like its predecessors.
('68', 332, 1, 17, 628612) Those earlier ones were bound to be big shows.
('68', 332, 1, 18, 628659) They were designed for a different purpose.
('68', 332, 1, 19, 628703) Congress expenses were generally found out of the takings of the exhibition.
('68', 332, 1, 20, 628780) The whole outlook was changed last year.
('68', 332, 1, 21, 628821) We decided not to have things of spectacular interest, but we decided to give the spectators a glimpse of the Indian villager and his craft.
('68', 332, 1, 22, 628962) This therefore is a vast educative effort.
('68', 332, 1, 23, 629005) Not that we will have no takings this time.
('68', 332, 1, 24, 629049) Only they will depened on those Congressmen who are intent on freedom and will win it by rehabilitating the village.
('68', 332, 1, 25, 629166) If they will establish a living bond between towns and villages, they will

('68', 333, 1, 2, 629371) flock to the exhibition and will make a point of studying the various demonstrations in the exhibition.
('68', 333, 1, 3, 629475) This cannot be done by one visit only.
('68', 333, 1, 4, 629514) You should visit it daily and carefully study every section.
('68', 333, 1, 5, 629575) If you will do this, you will marvel at the energy and industry expended in organizing it.
('68', 333, 1, 6, 629666) You will be deeply interested in it if you approach it in a spirit of service.
('68', 333, 1, 7, 629745) You will find here craftsmen and craftswomen for Kashmir and South India, form Sind and Assam, and learn how they earn their scanty living.
('68', 333, 1, 8, 629885) You will find that it is within your power to add a little to their income and to enable them to have square meal, if only you will make up your minds to pay for their wares enough to ensure them a living wage.
('68', 333, 1, 9, 630096) You will not expect me to describe all or even one of the numerous sections of the exhibition.
('68', 333, 1, 10, 630191) It is impossible for me to do so.
('68', 333, 1, 11, 630225) Let me tell you that you will have an inkling of the inside even from where you are sitting.
('68', 333, 1, 12, 630318) For in fornt of you are no triumphal arches but there are simply but exquisitely decorated walls done by Sjt.
('68', 333, 1, 13, 630428) Nandlal Bose, the eminent artist from Santiniketan, and his co workers who have tried to represent all the villagers crafts in simple artistic symbols.
('68', 333, 1, 14, 630580) And when you go inside the art gallery on which Babu Nandlal Bose has lavished his labours for weeks, you will feel, as I did, like spending there hours together.
('68', 333, 1, 15, 630743) But even the other sections will attract you.
('68', 333, 1, 16, 630789) You may not find in the exhibition anything to amuse you like music or cinema shows but I assure you you will find much to learn.
('68', 333, 2, 17, 630919) In conclusion, I want you all to be voluntary advertising agents of the exhibition so that numbers may be attracted to see it.
('68', 333, 2, 18, 631046) The exhibition has not been organized for the villagers, it is organized for the city dweller to enable him to see how the villager lives and what he is capable of.
('68', 333, 2, 19, 631211) The Reception Committee has spent something like Rs. 35, 000 in order to bring this exhibition into being.
('68', 333, 2, 20, 631318) The lest that you must do is to enable them to meet the expenses.
('68', 333, 2, 21, 631384) This you can do if you become their enthusiastic advertising agents.
('68', 333, 2, 22, 631453) Commission I can promise none, though I dare say you will get it for work dutifully done when you appear before the Great White Throne.
('68', 333, 2, 23, 631589) I may tell you that I am staying here for some days and expect to visit the exhibition as often as I can.
('68', 333, 2, 24, 631695) I shall therefore know how you have discharged your trust.

('68', 334, 1, 2, 631800) It is our intention to throw the exhibition open to the people from villages if the expenses are covered.
('68', 334, 1, 3, 631906) You will find in the exhibition many a drawback, but you and I are to blame for them, not the villagers.
('68', 334, 1, 4, 632011) Let me tell you, however, that the organizers have attempted the stupendous task of achieving in a few weeks the work which should take many months to be properly done.
('68', 334, 1, 5, 632180) You will therefore bear with us and forgive the shortcomings you will no doubt see.

('68', 334, 5, 12, 632439) I was able to speak for over 38 minutes without any strain at the opening of the Exhibition.
('68', 334, 5, 13, 632532) It is too early to say whether it will be a success.

('68', 335, 7, 13, 633907) I have received no communication whatsoever from Lord Halifax.
('68', 335, 7, 14, 633970) The whole story is a fabrication.

('68', 335, 13, 23, 634542) 2 Some newspapers had reported that Lord Halifax was arranging an interview between Lord Linlithgow and Gandhiji.

('68', 339, 10, 12, 639372) Yes, we had the rain here, too, but not much damage was done at the Exhibition for the dust storm and the cold wind gave ample warning.

('68', 339, 10, 18, 639792) Mahadev was inclined to purchase it.

('68', 340, 7, 17, 640979) I have been permitted for some time to write few letters daily and to write to a limited extent for Harijan.
('68', 340, 7, 18, 641088) This is however to inform you that Gurudevs presence in Delhi whilst I was there made it possible to collect the whole of the deficit, i.e., Rs. 60, 000. Gurudev was pleased beyond measure and cancelled the rest of the tour.
('68', 340, 7, 19, 641313) So you see how God worked.

('68', 341, 3, 6, 642015) I have had very long and quiet chats with Jawaharlal.
('68', 341, 3, 7, 642069) By the time this reaches you, you will know the result of the Congress deliberations.
('68', 341, 3, 8, 642155) You must have been filled with disgust as we have been here over the sensational and false news published in the Indian Press about the supposed interview to take place between the coming Viceroy and myself.

('68', 341, 9, 18, 642661) Bapas letter has not at all pained me.
('68', 341, 9, 19, 642700) I know you are not the one to take defeat and I believe the taunting words of Rukminibehn 2 will not affect you.
('68', 341, 9, 20, 642813) However, Bapas letter suggests that you are not really needed there.
('68', 341, 9, 21, 642882) It is a different matter that you are sure to be of service wherever you may be.
('68', 341, 9, 22, 642963) I wish to put you where they need your services, and you are indeed needed elsewhere.
('68', 341, 9, 23, 643049) Hence I have written to Bapa to send you to me if you are not really needed there.

('68', 342, 5, 12, 643849) A correspondent writes: 1
('68', 342, 6, 13, 643875) I would like to say a few words on the report of the interview 2 between Mrs. Sanger and Mahatma Gandhi that appeared recently in the Harijan.
('68', 342, 7, 14, 644018) The cardinal fact that I see missed in the interview is that it has not been taken into consideration that man is above all an artist and a creator.
('68', 342, 7, 15, 644167) He is not satisfied with bare necessity, but must have beauty, colour and charm as well .
('68', 342, 7, 16, 644257) He has made every necessity into an art and has spent tons of blood on them.
('68', 342, 7, 17, 644334) His creative instinct impels him to add to his difficulties and problems and solve them over again.
('68', 342, 7, 18, 644434) He cannot be simple as Rousseau, Ruskin, Tolstoy, Thoreau, and Gandhiji would like him to be.
('68', 342, 7, 19, 644528) War he must have as its necessary corollary which also he has transformed into a great art.
('68', 342, 8, 20, 644620) To appeal to him [to copy] the example of nature would be in vain, for it is totally incompatible with his very being.
('68', 342, 8, 21, 644739) Nature cannot be his teacher .
('68', 342, 8, 22, 644770) From an artistic standpoint, says Nietzsche the iconoclast, nature is no model.
('68', 342, 8, 23, 644850) It exaggerates, distorts and leaves gaps.
('68', 342, 8, 24, 644892) Nature is the accident.
('68', 342, 8, 25, 644916) To study from nature seems to me bad sign; thus lying in the dust before trivial facts is unworthy of a thorough artist.
('68', 342, 8, 26, 645037) To end sexual life when the need of propagation is no longer there, or to enjoin sex communion expressly with the desire of begetting offspring, is too calculating.
('68', 342, 8, 27, 645202) too natural, too matter of fact .
('68', 342, 9, 28, 645236) I do not mean to underrate the value of the discipline of self control or what is technically knows as brahmacharya.
('68', 342, 9, 29, 645353) I would always admire it as the

('68', 343, 1, 2, 645528) art of the control of the sex instinct carried to perfection.
('68', 343, 1, 3, 645590) But just as the perfection of other arts does not interfere with the science of life, with the whole life (in the Nietzschean sense of the term), with the proper scheme of all the values of life, so also I will not allow the value of the ideal of brahmacharya dominate other values, far less use is as an instrument of solving problems, such as over population.
('68', 343, 1, 4, 645952) I believe it was with an eye to such a scheme of values that the scriptures said,
('68', 343, 2, 5, 646034) or, there is brahmacharya where sexual union occurs only at night (i.e., as opposed to abnormal cohabitation during the day time).
('68', 343, 2, 6, 646165) Here normal sex life itself is sopken of as brahmacharya, the rigid conception of which began after we had already topsyturvied the proper scheme of all values of life.
('68', 343, 3, 7, 646334) I gladly publish this letter as I should any such letter that is not full of declamation, abuse or insinuations.
('68', 343, 3, 8, 646447) The reader should have both the sides of the question to enable him to come a decision.
('68', 343, 3, 9, 646535) I am myself eager to know why a thing which is claimed to be scientific and beneficial and which has many distinguished supporters repels me notwithstanding my effort to see the bright side of it.
('68', 343, 4, 10, 646732) Thus it is not proved to my satisfaction that sexual union in marriage is in itself good and beneficial to the unionists.
('68', 343, 4, 11, 646854) To the contrary effect I can bear ample testimony from my own experience and that of many friends.
('68', 343, 4, 12, 646953) I am not aware of any of us having derived any benefit, mental, spiritual or physical.
('68', 343, 4, 13, 647040) Momentary excitement and satisfaction there certainly was.
('68', 343, 4, 14, 647099) But it was invariably followed by exhaustion.
('68', 343, 4, 15, 647145) And the desire for union returned immediately the effect of exhaustion had worn out.
('68', 343, 4, 16, 647230) Although I have always been a conscientious worker, I can clearly recall the fact that this indulgence interfered with my work.
('68', 343, 4, 17, 647358) It was the consciousness of this limitation that put me on the track of self restraint and I have no manner of doubt that the self restraint is responsible for the comparative freedom form illnesses that I have enjoyed for long periods and for my output of energy and work both physical and mental which eye witnesses have described as phenomenal.
('68', 343, 5, 18, 647706) I fear that the correspondent has misapplied his reading.
('68', 343, 5, 19, 647764) Man is undoubtedly an artist and creator.
('68', 343, 5, 20, 647806) Undoubtedly he must have beauty and therefore colour.
('68', 343, 5, 21, 647860) His artistic and creative nature at its best taught him to see art in self restraint and ugliness in uncreative union.
('68', 343, 5, 22, 647979) His instinct for the artistic taught him to discriminate and to know that any
('68', 344, 0, 1, 648057) VOL. 68 : 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 345
('68', 344, 1, 2, 648103) conglomeration of colours was no mark of beauty, nor every sense enjoyment good in itself.
('68', 344, 1, 3, 648194) His eye for art taught man to seek enjoyment in usefulness.
('68', 344, 1, 4, 648254) Thus he learnt at an early stage if his evolution that he was to eat for its own sake as some of us still do, but he should eat to enable him to live.
('68', 344, 1, 5, 648405) At a later stage he learnt further that there was neither beauty nor joy in living for its own sake but that he must live to serve his fellow creatures and through them his Maker.
('68', 344, 1, 6, 648585) Similarly, when he pondered over the phenomenon of the pleasurableness of sexual union, he discovered that like every other organ of sense, this one of generation had its use and abuse.
('68', 344, 1, 7, 648771) And he saw that its true function, its right use, was to restrict it to generation.
('68', 344, 1, 8, 648855) Any other use, he saw, was ugly and he saw further that it was fraught with very serious consequences as well to the individual as to the race.
('68', 344, 1, 9, 648999) It is hardly necessary for me to prolong the argument.
('68', 344, 2, 10, 649054) The correspondent says well than man makes art out of his necessities.
('68', 344, 2, 11, 649125) Necessity is not only the mother of invention, it is the mother also of art.
('68', 344, 2, 12, 649202) We should therefore beware of that art which has not necessity as its basis.
('68', 344, 2, 13, 649279) Nor may we dignify every want by the name of necessity.
('68', 344, 2, 14, 649335) Mans estate is one of probation.
('68', 344, 2, 15, 649368) During that period he is played upon by evil forces as well as good.
('68', 344, 2, 16, 649437) He is every prey to temptations.
('68', 344, 2, 17, 649470) He has to prove his manliness by resisting and fighting temptations.
('68', 344, 2, 18, 649539) He is no warrior who fights outside foes of his imagination and is powerless to lift his little finger against the innumerable foes within, or, what is worse, mistakes them for friends.
('68', 344, 2, 19, 649725) War he must have.
('68', 344, 2, 20, 649743) But the correspondent is wrong when he says that as its necessary corollary he has transformed it into a great art.
('68', 344, 2, 21, 649859) He has hardly yet learnt the art of war.
('68', 344, 2, 22, 649900) He has mistaken false war for true even as our forefathers under a mistaken view of sacrifice instead of sacrificing their base passions sacrificed innocent non human fellow creatures as many even do at the present day.
('68', 344, 2, 23, 650120) We have yet to learn the art of true war.
('68', 344, 2, 24, 650162) Surely there is neither beauty nor art in what is going on today on the Abyssinian frontier.
('68', 344, 2, 25, 650255) The correspondent has chosen unhappy (for him) names for his illustrations.
('68', 344, 2, 26, 650331) Rousseau, Ruskin, Thoreau and Tolstoy were firstclass artists of their time.
('68', 344, 2, 27, 650408) They will live even after many of us are dead, cremated and forgotten.
('68', 344, 2, 28, 650479) The correspondent seems to have misapplied the word nature.
('68', 344, 2, 29, 650539) When an appeal to man is made to copy or study nature, he is not invited to follow what the reptiles do or even what the King of the
('68', 345, 0, 1, 650672) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 346
('68', 345, 1, 2, 650714) forest does.
('68', 345, 1, 3, 650727) He has to study mans nature at its best, i.e., I presume his regenerate nature, whatever it may be.
('68', 345, 1, 4, 650827) Perhaps it requires considerable effort to know what regenerate nature is.
('68', 345, 1, 5, 650902) It is dangerous nowadays to refer to old teachers.
('68', 345, 1, 6, 650953) I suggest to the correspondent that it is unnecessary to bring in Neitzsche or even Prashnopanishad.
('68', 345, 1, 7, 651054) The question for me is past the stage of quotations.
('68', 345, 1, 8, 651107) What has cold reason to say on the point under discussion?
('68', 345, 1, 9, 651166) Is it or is it not correct to say that the only right use of the generative organ is to confine it solely to generation and that any other use is its abuse?
('68', 345, 1, 10, 651323) If it is, no difficulty in achieving the right use and avoiding the wrong should baffle the scientific seeker.

('68', 345, 4, 13, 651478) The following appeal 1 has been issued by Sheth Jamnalal Bajaj and others:
('68', 345, 5, 14, 651553) The Dakshin Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha is the body at present engaged in carrying out Mahatma Gandhis work of propagating Hindi in South India, inaugurated by him eighteen years ago at the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan held at Prayag in 1918. Since its inception the Sabha has succeeded in laying the work of Hindi prachar in South India on a firm and sure basis.
('68', 345, 5, 15, 651910) For the last five or six years it has been functioning in a self sufficient manner.
('68', 345, 5, 16, 651994) It is at present operating through its 450 centres in four different provinces with different languages in South India.
('68', 345, 5, 17, 652114) Besides, the teaching of Hindi is being pushed forth through the various arts schools and colleges through the efforts of the Sabha.
('68', 345, 5, 18, 652247) The total number of students receiving instruction in Hindi in South India through the agency of the Sabha today stands over 40,000.
('68', 345, 6, 19, 652380) It is now proposed to erect a bhavan for the Sabha to house its various departments.
('68', 345, 6, 20, 652465) The Madras Corporation has donated three acres and a half of land for the purpose.
('68', 345, 6, 21, 652548) The scheme would cost one lakh rupees and when completed will include, besides residential quarters for the workers, a college with hostel accommodation for at least 50 for training workers for Hindi prachar work, an arts school where Hindi will be compulsory and a prayer hall and a gymnasium for the use of students and workers of the Sabha and the neighbouring public.

('68', 347, 5, 15, 654839) April 5, 1936
('68', 347, 6, 16, 654853) Mahatma Gandhi read out a letter from Mr. Narmada Prashad, Secretary of the Sammelan, regretting his absence due to illness and announcing a donation of Rs. 500. Mahatma Gandhi, speaking [in Hindi], said that these announcements 4 had made up for the debt the building had incurred but the building was still incomplete.
('68', 347, 6, 17, 655174) It was sad to reflect that whereas Mr. Tandon 5 had appealed for four lakhs the response had been so small in a matter which concerned what India had declared was its national language.
('68', 347, 6, 18, 655360) The country was undoubtedly starving.
('68', 347, 6, 19, 655398) Of course physically crores of people did not even have one meal a day and poverty and hunger in India were worse than in any [other] country in the world.
('68', 347, 6, 20, 655554) But he used the expression starving in a different sense.
('68', 347, 6, 21, 655612) Even lakhs of donations could not breathe soul into the language.
('68', 347, 6, 22, 655678) This work could be accomplished if someone was born whose heart overflowed, as Tagores had overflowed in Bengal and made Bangalee a living language.
('68', 347, 6, 23, 655827) The language never died.
('68', 347, 6, 24, 655852) Tulsidas and Surdas did not write for the sake of the Hindi language.

('68', 349, 2, 3, 657507) LUCKNOW, April 8, 1936
('68', 349, 3, 4, 657530) MY DEAR WEST 1, I was delighted to have your letter, and see your well known signature, after a long time.
('68', 349, 3, 5, 657637) Is it not years?
('68', 349, 3, 6, 657654) I am sorry about Sorabji 2. Though I am far away from where I can get access to books I can say with confidence that for years I have received no payments either through Reuters Agency or the East Indian Trading Co., or Dr. Nanji.
('68', 349, 3, 7, 657885) Amounts received by me through the Trust were, upon recommendation of Mr. Doull if I remember aright, backed by other trustees, sent back for Sorabjis use as a loan, his policy being accepted as received security.
('68', 349, 3, 8, 658099) The premium for the policy has not been paid and probably it has lapsed.
('68', 349, 3, 9, 658172) I gave this loan with the greatest reluctance.
('68', 349, 3, 10, 658219) But I felt that I could do so.
('68', 349, 3, 11, 658250) For in those circumstances had Parsi Rustomji been alive he would have liked me to help Sorabji.
('68', 349, 3, 12, 658347) Of course no part of the loan has been returned.
('68', 349, 3, 13, 658396) I had years ago small payment for giving prizes to children.
('68', 349, 3, 14, 658457) That sum still is held and prizes are still being distributed annually.
('68', 349, 3, 15, 658529) Beyond that there is nothing to report as there is no money in my hands on behalf of the two Trusts.
('68', 349, 3, 16, 658630) In order to get the authoritative statement I am forwarding your letter with this reply to Narandas Gandhi who is in charge of the books of the Ashram.
('68', 349, 3, 17, 658782) And if there is any error in what I have said, I shall rectify it.
('68', 349, 3, 18, 658849) You will please keep me informed of the results of your investigations.
('68', 349, 3, 19, 658921) I hope you are all doing well including Mrs. Pywell who must be nearing her century.
('68', 349, 3, 20, 659006) How are you doing now?

('68', 350, 2, 3, 659344) April 8, 1936
('68', 350, 3, 4, 659358) MY DEAR REBEL,
('68', 350, 4, 5, 659373) I am waiting for your wire in reply to mine.
('68', 350, 4, 6, 659418) You ought not to catch cold as often as you do.
('68', 350, 4, 7, 659466) I am quite sure that you can avoid these colds by a judiciously natural life.
('68', 350, 4, 8, 659544) I have a vague fear that your silk underwear has not a little to do with the delicacy of your skin.
('68', 350, 4, 9, 659644) There is also the constant irritation you subject your skin to by frequent baths and still more frequent face washes.
('68', 350, 4, 10, 659762) Add to this the criminal use of soap which destroys all the grease with which nature protects the skin.
('68', 350, 4, 11, 659866) These three exterior causes perhaps largely account for your colds.
('68', 350, 4, 12, 659934) Discuss this with Shummy and if the physician in him endorses my view, make the necessary change, not perhaps all at once but one by one.
('68', 350, 4, 13, 660072) Khurshed is here and so is Perin 1. I have sent your memo to them to make a selection.
('68', 350, 4, 14, 660159) I have authorized not more than Rs. 600 investment.
('68', 350, 4, 15, 660211) You should not incur any loss on the articles.
('68', 350, 4, 16, 660258) The shawl and the knife will be packed with the other articles.
('68', 350, 4, 17, 660322) Prabha is sitting by me as I write this.

('68', 350, 10, 23, 660524) I was longing to hear from you and to know how you were faring.
('68', 350, 10, 24, 660588) I was therefore glad to see your handwriting and that, too, Gujarati.
('68', 350, 10, 25, 660658) I observe that you have not forgotten your Gujarati as you have forgotten your khadi.
('68', 350, 10, 26, 660744) But that is nothing.
('68', 350, 10, 27, 660765) It is better to be perfectly natural and bad than to be artificially good.

('68', 351, 8, 22, 661863) It would be good to do so one hour before you begin your meal.

('68', 352, 1, 2, 662184) 430. DANGER FROM WITHIN
('68', 352, 2, 3, 662208) No movement or organization having vitality dies from external attack.
('68', 352, 2, 4, 662279) It dies of internal decay.
('68', 352, 2, 5, 662306) This is true at any rate of great all India organizations like the A.I.S.A. and A.I.V.I.A. or the Harijan Sevak Sangh.
('68', 352, 2, 6, 662425) I omit mention of others which are no less for all India than these three.
('68', 352, 2, 7, 662500) I single out the first two for they seek to represent and promote the immediate welfare of the millions of villagers who do not earn enough to keep body and soul together because they have to live in enforced idleness for at least four months in the year for want of work.
('68', 352, 2, 8, 662773) And I refer to the third because it seeks to represent the despised millions of society.
('68', 352, 2, 9, 662862) The three causes are thus worthy.
('68', 352, 2, 10, 662896) They should, therefore, not only be able to survive all external attack but even to thrive on it.
('68', 352, 2, 11, 662994) It is clear that they cannot flourish on mere pecuniary support.
('68', 352, 2, 12, 663059) They will always need it, but it must come as a direct fruit of honest work.
('68', 352, 2, 13, 663136) Therefore, what is necessary is character above suspicion, ceaseless effort accompanied by ever increasing knowledge of the technique of the work and a life of rigorous simplicity.
('68', 352, 2, 14, 663317) Workers without character, living far above the ordinary life of villagers, and devoid of the knowledge required of them for their work, can produce no impression on the villagers whether Harijan or other.
('68', 352, 2, 15, 663523) As I write these lines instances of those workers who for want of character or simple living damaged the cause and themselves recur to my mind.
('68', 352, 2, 16, 663667) Happily instances of positive misconduct are rare.
('68', 352, 2, 17, 663718) But the greatest hindrance to the progress of the work lies in the inability of workers of quality of support themselves on the village scale.
('68', 352, 2, 18, 663861) If every one of such workers puts on his work a price which village service cannot sustain, ultimately these organizations must be wound up.
('68', 352, 2, 19, 664002) For the existence of payments on the city scale except in rare and temporary cases would imply that the gulf between cities and villages is unbridgeable.
('68', 352, 2, 20, 664156) The village movement is as much an education of the city people as of the villagers.
('68', 352, 2, 21, 664241) Workers drawn from cities have to develop village mentality and learn the art of living after the manner of villagers.
('68', 352, 2, 22, 664360) This does not mean that they have to starve like the villagers.
('68', 352, 2, 23, 664424) But it does mean that there must be a radical change in the old style of life.
('68', 352, 2, 24, 664503) While the standard of living in the villages must be raised, the city standard has to undergo considerable revision, without the worker being required in any way to adopt a mode of life that would impair his health.

('68', 353, 2, 3, 664803) The Secretary of the Tamil Nad Branch of the A.I.S.A. writes to Shri Shankerlal Banker: 1
('68', 353, 3, 4, 664893) The old khadi merchants of Tirupur have started an association for certifying their khadi products.
('68', 353, 4, 5, 664993) Their object is to sell their existing stocks at enhanced rates and allow liberal commission to retail merchants throughout the province and to continue khadi production at old system and pay low wages.
('68', 353, 4, 6, 665196) Many an old spinner, who is either unable to purchase cotton from us or improve the quality of yarn, may continue to spin for these merchants.
('68', 353, 4, 7, 665339) We are, however, making arrangements to counteract these merchants efforts by vigorous propaganda among the villagers by pamphlets, private talks and lectures about the object and work of our Association and that of these merchants.
('68', 353, 4, 8, 665572) Our workers go from house to house and teach the spinners how to hank and improve the quality of yarn.
('68', 353, 5, 9, 665675) These merchants still continue to use our name for deceiving the public.
('68', 353, 5, 10, 665748) Their sign boards, letter heads, bills, invoices, labels on clothes are all printed as certified by the A.I.S.A. I sent them letters the other day asking them to strike out our name at once.
('68', 353, 5, 11, 665939) One merchant has replied as follows:
('68', 353, 6, 12, 665976) I am surprised to read your letter dated 2 3 36. You say that if I do not strike off the words Certified by A.I.S.A. within a week you are going to take legal action.
('68', 353, 6, 13, 666143) The All India Spinners Association is not a registered body.
('68', 353, 6, 14, 666204) . Neither you nor anybody else has the right to object or protest.
('68', 353, 7, 15, 666271) I have written to the Press.
('68', 353, 7, 16, 666300) I am making arrangements to stock A. I. S. A. certified khadi at every Congress sabha.
('68', 353, 7, 17, 666387) Already two committees, the Mylapore Congress Committee and the Vedaranyam Town Congress Committee, have taken sales certificates.
('68', 353, 7, 18, 666518) I hope before long other committees will apply for certificates and arrange to stock and sell khadi.
('68', 353, 8, 19, 666619) I request that you will kindly explain the situation to Mahatmaji and request him to issue an appeal in the Press asking people who cannot spin for themselves to purchase only A. I, S. A. certified khadi and also to sound a note of warning to the merchants of Tirupur.
('68', 353, 9, 20, 666888) It is certainly wrong of the erstwhile certified khadi merchants to continue their trade in uncertified khadi after refusing to conform to the new rules about khadi and thus making themselves unfit for

('68', 354, 1, 2, 667187) certificates.
('68', 354, 1, 3, 667201) Their conduct is unpatriotic and unhuman.
('68', 354, 1, 4, 667243) They ought not to exploit the poor spinners and to a much lesser degree the credulous buyers.
('68', 354, 1, 5, 667337) I would urge them to conform to the new rules and take out certificates, or if they are not satisfied with the new scale, to take to some other business.
('68', 354, 1, 6, 667491) It ill becomes them to retort that the A.I.S.A. is not a registered body and that therefore they can do what they like.
('68', 354, 1, 7, 667611) I suggest to the objectors that their defiance of a body which they have hitherto obeyed is a breach of the moral and social code.
('68', 354, 1, 8, 667742) But whilst I hope that my appeal to the sellers of uncertified khadi will bear fruit, I would like the Secretary of the Tamil Nad Branch to acquaint the spinners of the new rules and persuade them not to spin for lower wages.
('68', 354, 1, 9, 667968) The most effective remedy lies in the hands of the spinners.
('68', 354, 1, 10, 668029) Of course I heartily endorse the Secretarys appeal to Congress Committees and other lovers of the poor villagers to take out certificates for the sale of khadi and thus render concrete sevice to the toiling spinners.
('68', 354, 1, 11, 668246) Their active co operation will largely check the sale of uncertified khadi.

('68', 355, 2, 3, 668710) LUCKNOW, April 12, 1936
('68', 355, 3, 4, 668734) [Gandhiji] appealed to them to go and visit the Exhibition, once, twice, three
('68', 355, 4, 5, 668813) times, even four times, with their eyes and ears open, and if possible with the eyes and ears of their souls open.
('68', 355, 4, 6, 668928) They would then see miracles in the Exhibition.
('68', 355, 4, 7, 668976) When I told 1 you the other day that the Exhibition was not a cinema show, I meant more than I said.
('68', 355, 4, 8, 669077) 2 If you move about this Exhibition with my eyes and ears, you will spontaneously exclaim, Hurrah!
('68', 355, 4, 9, 669176) what a splendid exhibition! There may be many young men here who shout hurrah on witnessing the dance and gesticulations of a woman.
('68', 355, 4, 10, 669309) But God has given us eyes not to see and appreciate the dance of a woman, but to recognize the mother in her.
('68', 355, 4, 11, 669419) The hurrah that will spontaneously come to your lips on witnessing the Exhibition with my eyes and ears will be clean and not filthy.
('68', 355, 4, 12, 669553) We go into raptures no hearing the name of Khuda or Rama in a durgah, mosque or a temple.
('68', 355, 4, 13, 669643) You can look upon this Exhibition as an equally sacred place.
('68', 355, 4, 14, 669705) You will not find here anything to captivate you in a sensual way.
('68', 355, 4, 15, 669772) You have to see it with my eyes.
('68', 355, 4, 16, 669805) It does not mean you should see it with the eyes of a mahatma.
('68', 355, 4, 17, 669868) I am only a villager, a simple man.
('68', 355, 4, 18, 669904) Therefore you have to look at this village industries exhibition with the eyes of a simple villager.
('68', 355, 4, 19, 670005) Anyone who pays a rupee, the charge for seeing the Exhibition four times, can learn four lessons in the bargain.
('68', 355, 4, 20, 670118) I am sure you have heard about spectacles made of pebble.
('68', 355, 4, 21, 670176) Now, here you can actually witness them being made.
('68', 355, 4, 22, 670228) Where else would you go to learn this craft?
('68', 355, 4, 23, 670273) But then this is a rather difficult job.
('68', 355, 4, 24, 670314) They also make paper here.
('68', 355, 4, 25, 670341) You will be amazed at the progress made by the paper industry.
('68', 355, 4, 26, 670404) Even a lad of ten can make paper if he wants to.
('68', 355, 4, 27, 670453) If you closely study here the process of paper making you will be able to pursue the craft in your home.
('68', 355, 4, 28, 670558) Here you will come across a novelty at every step and stop to marvel at it.

('68', 356, 1, 2, 670879) When you go to a cinema show you meet with things there to captivate in a sensual way your eyes and ears.
('68', 356, 1, 3, 670985) I may tell you that we have tried to boycott from this Exhibition everything that had no educative value.
('68', 356, 1, 4, 671091) We have tried to make the Exhibition a sacred and holy place, a feast for your eyes and ears, a spiritual feast capable of purifying the senses.
('68', 356, 1, 5, 671236) I shall tell you why.
('68', 356, 1, 6, 671258) Do you know Orissa and its skeletons?
('68', 356, 1, 7, 671296) Well, form that hungerstricken, impoverished land of skeletons have come men who have wrought miracles in bone and horn and silver.
('68', 356, 1, 8, 671428) Go and see these things not only ready made but in the making, and see how the soul of man even in an impoverished body can breathe life into lifeless horns and metal.
('68', 356, 1, 9, 671596) A poor potter has also worked miracles out of clay.
('68', 356, 2, 10, 671648) I have bought from the stall a nice little ink pot to hold my ink.
('68', 356, 2, 11, 671715) I thought its price would be six or seven annas, but I was surprised to learn that it was just one pice.
('68', 356, 2, 12, 671820) Well, when you look at it you will no doubt wonder if it had not come from Germany or Japan.
('68', 356, 2, 13, 671913) But the article is village made.
('68', 356, 2, 14, 671946) If this is not a wonder, what is?
('68', 356, 3, 15, 671980) Things which I thought would be worth several annas are worth only a copper or a couple of coppers and yet they are delicate little pieces of art.
('68', 356, 3, 16, 672127) A dear sister purchased the other day a little Krishna in ivory.
('68', 356, 3, 17, 672192) She was not given to worshipping Lord Krishna, but she now tells that she has begun to worship the exquisite little form.
('68', 356, 3, 18, 672314) The Exhibition is thus not a spectacular show, but a kind of fairyland.
('68', 356, 3, 19, 672386) But our tastes have been so debased that miracles happening before our very eyes appear like so much dust or clay and trifles coming from abroad become exquisite pieces of art; water from a spring in far off Europe with the witchery of an unintelligible name becomes invested with miraculous quality, while the water of the holy Ganges which is said to be a purifier and a natural disinfectant seems to be no better than water from a dirty pool.
('68', 356, 3, 20, 672832) You can, of course, see that craftsmen from distant Travancore, Kashmir and Cuttack have congregated here.
('68', 356, 3, 21, 672939) These poor people have come here to earn a few coins by exhibiting their crafts.
('68', 356, 3, 22, 673020) Therefore those people on whom God has bestowed money ought to purchase here something or other.
('68', 356, 3, 23, 673117) Things are not overpriced here.
('68', 356, 3, 24, 673149) It is another matter if you yourself pay a fabulous price for a piece which pleases you.
('68', 356, 3, 25, 673238) The price you pay here will not go to fill the pockets of any rich

('68', 357, 1, 3, 673473) It will directly reach the purse of the poor villager to whom all of us are indebted.
('68', 357, 1, 4, 673559) We are all living at the cost of the villagers.
('68', 357, 1, 5, 673607) The city dwellers are exploiting the villagers, and they must repay the debt, at least partially.
('68', 357, 1, 6, 673705) A link has been built to bridge the yawning gulf between the cities and the villages; we have only to cross this bridge.
('68', 357, 1, 7, 673826) Patronizing village industries will constitute the crossing of the bridge.
('68', 357, 1, 8, 673901) This is not a metter of charity; I have placed a purely commercial proposition before you.
('68', 357, 1, 9, 673992) Those who buy things here should also return with hurrah on their lips; and the craftsmen from Kashmir, Travancore, Cuttack, etc., should also return to their homes saying, Hurrah, how well the people in Lucknow appreciated our handiwork. If you engrave my words on your hearts, I shall also feel that I have been duly paid for my lecture.
('68', 357, 2, 10, 674332) If a vision of the kind I have described to you fails to stir your hearts and urge you to make some little sacrifice for the illfed and the underfed, God help you.
('68', 357, 2, 11, 674496) Iqbal whose poem Hindostan hamara 2
('68', 357, 3, 12, 674532) still stirs our hearts with emotion must have had some such vision before his minds eye when he described India with her eternal sentry the Himalayas, and Ganges the eternal witness of the numerous stages through which our civilization has passed.
('68', 357, 3, 13, 674780) We attend flag hoisting ceremonies and are proud of our National Flag.
('68', 357, 3, 14, 674851) Let me tell you that our pride has no meaning if you do not like things made in India and hanker after foreign ones.
('68', 357, 3, 15, 674968) It is idle for those whose heart is not stirred at the light of things made by our poor craftsmen and craftswomen and to make a little sacrifice for them to talk of independence for India.

('68', 357, 6, 18, 675222) [Before April 13, 1936] 4
('68', 357, 7, 19, 675248) DEAR FRIEND, Your letter.
('68', 357, 7, 20, 675274) Wisdom suggests ad experience testifies that one should never grieve over the past, however sinful or awful it might have been.
('68', 357, 7, 21, 675402) The past is worth remembering only in order to profit by
('68', 357, 8, 22, 675459) 1 This paragraph is from Harijan Sevak.
('68', 357, 8, 23, 675499) What follows is from Harijan.
('68', 357, 8, 24, 675529) 2 Sare jahanse achchha Hindostan hamara 3 The addressee, a retired accountant, had written that though he was 65 he was not free from passion and had broken certain vows taken in the past.

('68', 358, 1, 2, 675834) it, to strengthen the good we might have done and to prevent, with all our might, a repetition of the bad.
('68', 358, 1, 3, 675941) I hold that determination never to repeat a sin is the best form of repentance.
('68', 358, 1, 4, 676021) The only remedy I can suggest is to rely upon Ramanama with an undying faith.
('68', 358, 1, 5, 676099) It will surely give you mental relief and ultimately root out all the evil that may be in you in spite of yourself.

('68', 358, 3, 9, 676334) DEAR HYSTERICAL IDIOT, Your two letters before me.
('68', 358, 3, 10, 676385) I may leave tomorrow and for certain the day after.
('68', 358, 3, 11, 676437) On reaching Wardha I shall send you a wire if the change of scene does not produce a lapse of memory, as it so often does with me.
('68', 358, 4, 12, 676568) The parcel is in course of preparation.
('68', 358, 4, 13, 676608) I have the Rs. 100 in mind.
('68', 358, 4, 14, 676636) Add the amount to your donation to the Kamala Memorial.
('68', 358, 4, 15, 676692) You will see the notice in a day or two.
('68', 358, 4, 16, 676733) You may give as much as you comfortably can.
('68', 358, 4, 17, 676778) And if you knew her well and that as a woman of rare spiritual beauty, make collections if you can, in an easy way.
('68', 358, 4, 18, 676894) I do not want you to strain yourself in any way.
('68', 358, 4, 19, 676943) Nor must you do it because I suggest it.
('68', 358, 4, 20, 676984) If I settle down in Segaon, I shall most decidedly be available to the outside world and certainly to idiots, lunatics and the like.
('68', 358, 4, 21, 677117) And you may depend upon my taking care of brother ass.
('68', 358, 4, 22, 677172) Therefore Be careful for nothing.
('68', 358, 4, 23, 677206) I have asked K. 2 to expedite the purchases for you.
('68', 358, 4, 24, 677259) You shall certainly pay for the hospital building in Maganwadi.

('68', 359, 7, 10, 677898) MANILAL AND SUSHILA,
('68', 359, 8, 11, 677919) I got your letter.
('68', 359, 8, 12, 677938) I have gone through the article on the Agents marriage.
('68', 359, 8, 13, 677994) It puts forth a good argument but it cannot be said that it is written in good English.
('68', 359, 8, 14, 678082) Some mistakes have gone undetected.
('68', 359, 8, 15, 678118) However, it does not matter.
('68', 359, 8, 16, 678147) I say this only to draw your attention to it.
('68', 359, 8, 17, 678193) What is essential is clarity of thought although it would be good to write a language faultlessly.
('68', 359, 8, 18, 678292) Of course a mistake in a foreign language may be excusable.
('68', 359, 8, 19, 678352) We are still in Lucknow.
('68', 359, 8, 20, 678377) Probably we shall leave here on the 15th.
('68', 359, 8, 21, 678419) For the present we shall be going to Wardha.
('68', 359, 8, 22, 678464) I am thinking of settling down in a village near Wardha.
('68', 359, 8, 23, 678521) Nimu 2, Krishnadas and his wife Manojna, Prabhudas and Amba, etc., are here at present.
('68', 359, 8, 24, 678609) Umiya 3 and her husband Shankarlal 4 live close to us.
('68', 359, 8, 25, 678664) Jaisukhlal also has come and has put up near the Exhibition.
('68', 359, 8, 26, 678725) The Exhibition has been a success.
('68', 359, 8, 27, 678760) Kanti, Navin, Kanu, Ba are with me already, and also Jamnalalji, Janakidevi and Madalasa.
('68', 359, 8, 28, 678850) Thus we have quite a good gathering here.
('68', 359, 8, 29, 678892) The day after tomorrow, however, most of them will have dispersed.
('68', 359, 9, 30, 678959) 1 Mahadev Desai records: Brelvi reported that Masani had said that Gandhijis inclination was then growing more and more towards non acceptance of ministry.

('68', 360, 7, 15, 680027) I dread your nightly adventures.

('68', 361, 2, 3, 680623) April 14, 1936 Your letter surprises me although I rather like it, too.
('68', 361, 2, 4, 680695) Your language does not appear to spring from your heart.
('68', 361, 2, 5, 680752) Perhaps such language comes to you naturally.
('68', 361, 2, 6, 680798) I am not impressed by the mention of your jap 2, etc.
('68', 361, 2, 7, 680852) You had written a similar letter at Maganwadi.
('68', 361, 2, 8, 680899) In spite of the several vows you took you were full of sensual aberrations and kept from me the fact.
('68', 361, 2, 9, 681001) This letter gives no proof of your frankness.
('68', 361, 2, 10, 681047) You seem to accept your guilt because you have no option.
('68', 361, 2, 11, 681105) I see in it no feeling of remorse although it may be that I am mistaken.
('68', 361, 2, 12, 681178) Maybe, you have turned a new leaf; on my part, I would of course wish it.
('68', 361, 2, 13, 681252) Show all the papers to Ramjibhai and confess everything to him.
('68', 361, 2, 14, 681316) Do away with such figurative and flowery language.
('68', 361, 2, 15, 681367) Use adjectives sparingly.
('68', 361, 2, 16, 681393) Your very first sentence irks: Let us thank the gracious Dweller in the heart for bringing in the fortunate opportunity of confess with humility what was concealed by conwardice.
('68', 361, 2, 17, 681572) Why us?
('68', 361, 2, 18, 681580) I see nothing to be thankful for.
('68', 361, 2, 19, 681614) I have not known such a thing happening to man all of a sudden, as you describe.
('68', 361, 2, 20, 681695) By saying If we went into the details I might perhaps win the point, you weaken your feeling of remorse, if you had any.
('68', 361, 2, 21, 681816) Do go into the details, if you think you can win the point that way.
('68', 361, 2, 22, 681885) The saints magnify their own fault if it were as samll as a speck of dust and make it look as big as an elephant.
('68', 361, 2, 23, 681999) You are, however, not at all obliged to do so; you kept back for long whatever you had [to confess].

('68', 361, 5, 27, 682249) April 14, 1936
('68', 361, 6, 28, 682264) Speaking for five minutes Mahatma Gandhi said that the Harijans had all his blessings and asked them to have patience as the demon of untouchability was a long standing one and could not be destroyed in a day.
('68', 361, 6, 29, 682474) He exhorted them to be clean and neat and assured them that he was always with them and was one among them.

('68', 362, 2, 3, 682753) [Before April 16, 1936] 2
('68', 362, 3, 4, 682779) This book cover is made by our women, said the lady from Poland.
('68', 362, 3, 5, 682844) Thanking them Gandhiji asked: Is it only the women who spin and weave there, and do the men do nothing?
('68', 362, 4, 6, 682948) Spinning is done exclusively by women.
('68', 362, 4, 7, 682987) But men are not idlers either.
('68', 362, 4, 8, 683018) They are engaged in other crafts.
('68', 362, 4, 9, 683052) For instance this wooden casket is made by our men Is this a recent revival, or has the movement been on for some time?
('68', 362, 4, 10, 683172) Has it touched the intellectual classes, or is there a gulf between them and the masses?
('68', 362, 5, 11, 683261) No; the intellectuals have taken keenly to it and we have had the movement now for some time.
('68', 362, 5, 12, 683355) and it is daily growing.
('68', 362, 5, 13, 683380) And how do you happen to work togetheryou who must be as poles asunder, Poland an agricultural country and France a highly industrialized country?
('68', 362, 5, 14, 683527) We have been working together for several years.
('68', 362, 5, 15, 683576) There is a village industries movement in France too, and we thought we should go together to India to study things first hand.
('68', 362, 5, 16, 683704) We must say we have had much to learn.
('68', 362, 6, 17, 683743) They were contemplating writing a book on India and wanted to know whether they could serve India by doing so.
('68', 362, 6, 18, 683854) You could, if you write for Poland and France or say Europe, but not if you write for India.
('68', 362, 7, 19, 683947) They paused for a moment wondering what Gandhiji meant.
('68', 362, 7, 20, 684003) I shall explain.
('68', 362, 7, 21, 684020) If you have really learnt somethiing from our villages, you can only give the benefit of that learning to your own people.
('68', 362, 7, 22, 684143) What I learn from the West I give to my country.
('68', 362, 7, 23, 684192) Fallen though we seem today, our villages have still to teach something to the world.
('68', 362, 7, 24, 684278) And if what you say to your people appeals to them, that will have its reaction on us.
('68', 362, 7, 25, 684365) What I say holds good only if you have really learnt something worthy from our villages.
('68', 362, 7, 26, 684454) Perhaps the Exhibition has opened your eyes to many possibilities.
('68', 362, 8, 27, 684521) 1 Two ladies, one from Poland and the other from France, representing the village industries movement in Europe, called on Gandhiji and presented a little hand spun hand woven book cover and a tiny wooden casket.
('68', 362, 8, 28, 684734) 2 According to Mahadev Desais Weekly Letter from which the report is extracted, the discussion took place at Lucknow.
('68', 362, 8, 29, 684852) Gandhiji left Lucknow on April 16.

('68', 363, 1, 2, 684929) I should like to spend weeks there and fill my soul with the atmosphere of the past.
('68', 363, 1, 3, 685014) You find there workmen actually at workworkmen from Orissa and Kashmir working with their crudest possible tools, if you please, and yet conjuring up with their aid some of the most gorgeous articles in silver and wool.
('68', 363, 1, 4, 685234) The things you have brought for me are no patch on similar things you will find in the Exhibition.
('68', 363, 1, 5, 685333) Look at the men from Patan working at their sari of exquisite pattern and design.
('68', 363, 1, 6, 685415) The work is now confined to only four families whereas hundreds of families used to get their living in the past out of the work.
('68', 363, 1, 7, 685545) They are so conservative that they would not let their nearest neighbour know the cunning of their craft.
('68', 363, 1, 8, 685651) But we have drawn some of them out into light.
('68', 363, 1, 9, 685698) Some of this work can be revived, in all its glory, if we are prepared to pay for it adequately, pay enough to feed them and to keep them in health and comfort.
('68', 363, 1, 10, 685859) Now that is a nearly perfect Exhibition, i.
('68', 363, 1, 11, 685903) e., as perfect as it could be looking to the limited time at the disposal of the organizers and to the numerous handicaps they had to contend against.
('68', 363, 1, 12, 686054) And yet it is nothing compared to what it could be, if we could have brought all the representative men and wemen engaged in many other crafts.

('68', 363, 6, 21, 686453) I wonder if you have any other plan.
('68', 363, 6, 22, 686490) We are going to Wardha today.

('68', 364, 2, 3, 686730) LUCKNOW, April 16, 1936
('68', 364, 3, 4, 686754) JAYAPRAKASH,
('68', 364, 4, 5, 686767) You had a right to tell Jamnalalji what you did about me.
('68', 364, 4, 6, 686825) But you should have taken me into confidence if you felt hurt.
('68', 364, 4, 7, 686888) Prabha came to me with your consent as well as Brijkishore Babus.
('68', 364, 4, 8, 686954) I can say nothing about the influence I exercised on her.
('68', 364, 4, 9, 687012) But by her association with me there has been no waning of her devotion to her father or love for her husband.
('68', 364, 4, 10, 687123) True, Prabha does not give you conjugal satisfaction, because by her very nature she cannot.
('68', 364, 4, 11, 687216) She was free from passion even before she came to me.
('68', 364, 4, 12, 687270) We can only go by what she says.
('68', 364, 4, 13, 687303) She told me this repeatedly and firmly and I accepted her word.
('68', 364, 4, 14, 687367) Now tell me what I should do.
('68', 364, 4, 15, 687397) If you want that Prabha should give up visiting me or writing to me, for your peace of mind I will accept this restriction.
('68', 364, 5, 16, 687521) Blessings from BAPU

('68', 364, 8, 20, 687663) SEGAON [After April 17, 1936] 1
('68', 364, 9, 21, 687695) Mirabehn who is here in your midst came here with the intention of settling down for good.
('68', 364, 9, 22, 687786) But I find that she is not in a position to carry out her intention.
('68', 364, 9, 23, 687855) Even if she stayed on, she could do so not without considerable mental struggle.
('68', 364, 9, 24, 687936) The will is not lacking but perhaps the flesh is weak.
('68', 364, 9, 25, 687991) Now as you know an unbreakable bond of common service binds us both, and so I thought it my duty to do what she could not do.
('68', 364, 9, 26, 688117) God willing, therefore, I shall come to stay in
('68', 364, 10, 27, 688165) 1 According to Mahadev Desais Weekly Letter, from which the speech is extracted, Gandhiji visited Segaon soon after his return from Lucknow.
('68', 364, 10, 28, 688306) He reached Wardha on April 17, 1936.
('68', 365, 0, 1, 688343) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 366
('68', 365, 1, 2, 688385) your midst.
('68', 365, 1, 3, 688397) Maybe God will give me the strength that He did not vouchsafe to her.
('68', 365, 1, 4, 688467) But even Gods will is expressed through various agencies and unless I have your goodwill even I may fail in my mission.
('68', 365, 1, 5, 688587) Ever since my childhood it has been a principle with me that I should not think of inflicting myself on those who view my going in their midst with mistrust, misgivings or apprehension.
('68', 365, 1, 6, 688773) I should not think of coming here, except to serve you.
('68', 365, 1, 7, 688829) But in many places my presence and the programme I stand for are viewed with considerable dread.
('68', 365, 1, 8, 688926) At the back of this dread is the fact that I have made the removal of untouchability a lifes mission.You must have known from Mirabehn that I have cost out all untouchability from myself, that I hold all classes of peopleBrahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra, Rajput, Mahar, Chamarall alike, and I regard these distinctions based on birth as immoral.
('68', 365, 1, 9, 689278) We have suffered because of these distinctions, and this sense of high and low has vitiated our lives.
('68', 365, 1, 10, 689381) But I may tell you that I should not think of imposing these convictions on you.
('68', 365, 1, 11, 689462) I should try to do so by persuasion, above all by my own example.
('68', 365, 1, 12, 689528) I shall try to serve you by cleaning your roads and your surroundings, by trying to render such help as I can if there is illness in the village, by teaching you self help by way of helping you to revive your handicrafts.
('68', 365, 1, 13, 689750) If you will co operate with me I shall be happy, if you will not I shall be content to be absorbed among you as one among the few hundreds that live here.
('68', 365, 1, 14, 689905) I hope I shall come to settle here.
('68', 365, 1, 15, 689941) But it depends on His will.
('68', 365, 1, 16, 689969) For I did not know that He would move me from India to South Africa, and from South Africa I should come to Sabarmati, and from Sabarmati to Maganwadi,and now from Maganwadi to Segaon.
('68', 365, 2, 17, 690154) Harijan, 2 5 1936
('68', 365, 3, 18, 690172) 445. FOR CHRISTIAN FRIENDS
('68', 365, 4, 19, 690199) DEAR BR.
('68', 365, 5, 20, 690208) You have had your name blazoned abroad.
('68', 365, 5, 21, 690248) as one of the greatest philosophers and sacrificial workers on earth.
('68', 365, 5, 22, 690318) In India you have been proclaimed the Mahatma, and actually worshipped as one of the incarnations of Indias many deities.
('68', 365, 5, 23, 690440) Your practice also of fasting when sin has been committed.
('68', 365, 5, 24, 690499) has had a tendency to make Indians believe that you can merit
('68', 366, 0, 1, 690561) VOL. 68 : 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 367
('68', 366, 1, 2, 690607) blessing which can be communicated to others, but has anybody been loving and courageous enough to write and challenge you as to how personally you are going to obtain atonement for your own sin?
('68', 366, 1, 3, 690803) All your self denials and fastings and prayer and good deeds cannot blot out one sin of your early days.
('68', 366, 1, 4, 690908) For thirty or more years of your life you lived the carnal, self life, seeking and following your own plans and ambitions without seeking to know Gods purpose for your life or to honour His holy name.
('68', 366, 2, 5, 691109) Even if, as you profess to believe, Christ was only one of many incarnations of God, and the latest of them, you must either accept His tremendous claims as of Divine origin, or reject them as only human and fallible.
('68', 366, 2, 6, 691327) And when He declares as He did to the Jews of His day If ye believe
('68', 366, 3, 7, 691395) not that I am He, ye shall die in your sins or I am the way, the truth, and the life, no man cometh unto the Father, but by me, you must either believe Him to have been self deceived, or deliberately false.
('68', 366, 3, 8, 691602) I pray daily that Christ may grant you a revelation of Himself as He did to Saul of Tarsus, that.
('68', 366, 3, 9, 691700) you may be used to proclaim to Indias millions the sacrificial efficacy of His precious blood.
('68', 366, 3, 10, 691795) This is a typical letter 1 from an old English friend who regularly writes such letters almost every six months.
('68', 366, 3, 11, 691908) This friend is very earnest and well known to me.
('68', 366, 3, 12, 691958) But there are numerous other correspondents unknown to me who write in the same strain without arguing.
('68', 366, 3, 13, 692062) Since now I cannot for reasons of health write to individual writers, I use this letter as a text for a general reply.
('68', 366, 3, 14, 692181) Incidentally this effort will enable the readers of Harijan who accpet my guidance to understand the nature of my religious belief.
('68', 366, 3, 15, 692313) My correspondent is a literalist.
('68', 366, 3, 16, 692347) He gives its literal meaning to every text of the Bible in spite of its clear statement that the letter killeth, the spirit giveth life.
('68', 366, 3, 17, 692484) My very first reading of the Bible showed me that I would be repelled by many things in it if I gave their literal meaning many texts or even took every passage in it as the word of God.
('68', 366, 3, 18, 692671) I found as I proceeded with my study of the scriptures of the various religions that every scripture had to be treated likewise, not excepting the Vedas or the Upanishads.
('68', 366, 3, 19, 692843) Therefore the story of the immaculate conception when I interpret it mystically does not repel me.
('68', 366, 3, 20, 692942) I should find it hard to believe in the literal meaning of the verses relating to the immaculate conception of Jesus.
('68', 366, 3, 21, 693060) Nor would it deepen my regard for Jesus if I gave those verses their literal meaning.
('68', 366, 3, 22, 693146) This does not mean that the writers of the Gospels were untruthful persons.
('68', 366, 4, 23, 693222) 1 Of which only extracts have been reproduced here
('68', 367, 0, 1, 693273) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 368
('68', 367, 1, 2, 693315) They wrote in a mood of exaltation.
('68', 367, 1, 3, 693351) From my youth upward I learnt the art of estimating the value of scriptures on the basis of their ethical teaching.
('68', 367, 1, 4, 693467) Miracles therefore had no interest for me.
('68', 367, 1, 5, 693510) The miracles said ot have been performed by Jesus, even in I had believed them literally, would not have reconciled me to any teaching that did not satisfy universal ethics.
('68', 367, 1, 6, 693684) Somehow or other, words of religious teachers have for me, as I presume for millions, a living force which the same words uttered by ordinary mortals do not possess.
('68', 367, 1, 7, 693850) Jesus then to me is a great world teacher among others.
('68', 367, 1, 8, 693906) He was to the devotees of his generation no doubt the only begotten son of God.
('68', 367, 1, 9, 693986) Their belief need not be mine.
('68', 367, 1, 10, 694017) He affects my life no less because I regard him as one among the many begotten sons of God.
('68', 367, 1, 11, 694109) The adjcetive begotten has, for me, a deeper and possibly a grander meaning than its literal meaning.
('68', 367, 1, 12, 694211) For me it implies spiritual birth.
('68', 367, 1, 13, 694246) In his own times he was the nearest of God.
('68', 367, 1, 14, 694290) Jesus atoned for the sins of those who accepted his teachings by being an infallible example to them.
('68', 367, 1, 15, 694392) But the example was worth nothing to those who never troubled to change their lives.
('68', 367, 1, 16, 694477) A regenerate outgrows the original taint even as purified gold outgrows the original alloy.
('68', 367, 1, 17, 694569) I have made the frankest admission of my many sins.
('68', 367, 1, 18, 694621) But I do not carry their burden on my shoulders, If I am journeying Godward, as I feel I am, it is safe with me.
('68', 367, 1, 19, 694734) For I feel the warmth of the sunshine of His presence.
('68', 367, 1, 20, 694789) My austerities, fastings and prayers are, I know, of no value, if I rely upon them for reforming me.
('68', 367, 1, 21, 694890) But they have an inestimable value, it they represent, as I hope they do, the yearnings of a soul striving to lay his weary head in the lap of his Maker.
('68', 367, 1, 22, 695044) The Gita has become for me the key to the scriptures of the world.
('68', 367, 1, 23, 695111) It unravels for me the deepest mysteries to be found in them.
('68', 367, 1, 24, 695173) I regard them with the same reverence that I pay to the Hindu scriptures.
('68', 367, 1, 25, 695247) Hindus, Mussalmans, Christians, Parsis, Jews, are convenient labels.
('68', 367, 1, 26, 695316) But when I tear them down, I do not know which is which.
('68', 367, 1, 27, 695373) We are all children of the same God.
('68', 367, 1, 28, 695410) Verily, verily, I say unto you, not everyone that sayeth unto me Lord Lord, shall enter the Kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven shall enter the Kingdom, was said, though in different words, by all the great teachers of the world.

('68', 368, 3, 6, 695861) I hope you had my wire in time.
('68', 368, 3, 7, 695893) Sardar and Rajendra Babu came with me.
('68', 368, 3, 8, 695932) So we were quite a large company.
('68', 368, 3, 9, 695966) But we came by a train in which there was no discomfort caused to fellow passengers.
('68', 368, 3, 10, 696051) Only we came by the passenger train from Itarsi.
('68', 368, 3, 11, 696100) My programme is that I am in and about Wardha till the middle of May.
('68', 368, 3, 12, 696170) May go to Panchgani after that for about a fortnight.
('68', 368, 3, 13, 696224) I hope your throat is quite in order.
('68', 368, 3, 14, 696262) You must get rid of these ailments.
('68', 368, 3, 15, 696298) How you can do so I do not know.
('68', 368, 3, 16, 696331) But I do feel that there is a simple natural remedy.

('68', 368, 8, 23, 696566) It would be good if Jivram 1 gives up his insistence on attaching his mother in laws name to the donation.
('68', 368, 8, 24, 696673) If he does not, we shall have the name.
('68', 368, 8, 25, 696713) There is little likelihood of getting an extensive grazing ground for Rs. 500. He might entrust it to Gopabandhu Chowdhary to utilize the sum for the service of the cow.

('68', 369, 3, 4, 697233) Gandhiji has your letter of the 8th instant.
('68', 369, 3, 5, 697278) The contents surprised him, inasmuch as an educated man like you does not understand the reason why the price of khadi has slightly gone up.
('68', 369, 3, 6, 697419) It has been increased in order to enable the poor spinner to have something like a living wage.
('68', 369, 3, 7, 697515) We are far yet from giving him a real living wage, but the recent increase in khadi [prices] ensures him a wage just enough to secure him two full meals a day.
('68', 369, 3, 8, 697675) Do you, poor as you are, grudge the little increase to the men and women who are much poorer than you?

('68', 369, 7, 12, 697848) MY DEAR REBEL,
('68', 369, 8, 13, 697863) You are right in saying I worry about nothing and therefore not even about your persistent cough which you so lightly regarded.
('68', 369, 8, 14, 697991) But not to worry is not to neglect or underrate such information.
('68', 369, 8, 15, 698057) Why should you be so delicate?
('68', 369, 8, 16, 698088) Why should the slightest change in the weather upset you?
('68', 369, 8, 17, 698146) If it is the diet that is at the bottom, you must revert to the old regimen.
('68', 369, 8, 18, 698223) On no such account may you endanger your health.
('68', 369, 8, 19, 698272) There are occasions in a persons life when everything has to be sacrificed.
('68', 369, 8, 20, 698348) Surely a new regimen suddenly adopted is not such an occasion.
('68', 369, 8, 21, 698411) My own inclination is always on the side of nature cure.
('68', 369, 8, 22, 698468) But that you may not adopt unless Shummy co operates, you believe in it, and you get a proper guide.
('68', 369, 8, 23, 698569) A guide is obtainable but Shummy may not agree and you may not have faith in it.
('68', 369, 8, 24, 698650) Mere liking is of no consequence.
('68', 369, 8, 25, 698684) Please do not play with your ailments.
('68', 369, 8, 26, 698723) Even a rebel has to submit to the laws of nature.
('68', 369, 9, 27, 698773) 1 The addressee, a clerk of the Scindia Steam Navigation Company, had written to Gandhiji protesting against the increase in the price of khadi.

('68', 371, 3, 4, 700111) In my opinion The Hindustan Times has become a thoroughly worthless paper.
('68', 371, 3, 5, 700186) It does not contain any news worth knowing.
('68', 371, 3, 6, 700230) And if there are any they ae harmful.
('68', 371, 3, 7, 700268) If it cannot be improved you must wash your hands of it.
('68', 371, 3, 8, 700325) I do not see a single newspaper which publishes authentic news.
('68', 371, 3, 9, 700389) Of course I do not cite the instances.
('68', 371, 3, 10, 700428) Mahadev wrote to Parasnath 2 but so far there is no improvement.
('68', 371, 3, 11, 700493) You can hardly do anything !

('68', 371, 7, 16, 700627) MY DEAR REBEL,
('68', 371, 8, 17, 700642) Your letter gives encouraging news.
('68', 371, 8, 18, 700678) You do like to be told that letters from you are always welcome and wanted.
('68', 371, 8, 19, 700754) Well, this is to tell you once for all that you must write regularly except when you cant do so without straining yourself.
('68', 371, 8, 20, 700878) It must never be a task.
('68', 371, 8, 21, 700903) You are wrong as in usual for idiots.
('68', 371, 8, 22, 700941) Your letters were duly received in Lucknow.
('68', 371, 8, 23, 700985) But poor Kanu absent minded forgot that you were in Simla.
('68', 371, 8, 24, 701044) My memory is bad enough but it was quite in order for the purpose of sending you the wire.
('68', 371, 8, 25, 701135) I must however confess that I thought of it a few hours after my arrival.
('68', 371, 8, 26, 701209) I must find the yarn you want.
('68', 371, 8, 27, 701240) I shall try to get it twisted.
('68', 371, 8, 28, 701271) Dont be ill again.
('68', 371, 8, 29, 701290) What is the use of having the car there?
('68', 371, 8, 30, 701331) Surely it can be well looked after in Jullunder.

('68', 372, 4, 5, 701762) The notes make good reading.
('68', 372, 4, 6, 701791) Your answers were fairly full and of course straight.
('68', 372, 4, 7, 701845) Why do you feel worried over the forthcoming meeting 1?
('68', 372, 4, 8, 701901) If there is discussion it would only be to convince one another of the soundness of ones views.
('68', 372, 4, 9, 701997) You will stop the discussion when you think a proposition has been thoroughly argued.
('68', 372, 4, 10, 702083) After all you want team work and I have great hope of this happening.
('68', 372, 4, 11, 702153) I reach Nagpur 23rd evening.
('68', 372, 4, 12, 702182) I wish Ranjit 2 will take care of himself.
('68', 372, 4, 13, 702225) I am glad he has gone to Khali.
('68', 372, 4, 14, 702257) I expect Sarup to accompany you.
('68', 372, 4, 15, 702290) Sardar is still suffering and is just now on buttermilk only.

('68', 373, 3, 5, 703175) Why grieve over what comes inevitably with ones birth itself?
('68', 373, 3, 6, 703237) One should grieve, if at all, over ones birth.
('68', 373, 3, 7, 703284) I thought Rajkishori was not required to go there.
('68', 373, 3, 8, 703335) We are poor and we wish to live like the poor.
('68', 373, 3, 9, 703382) Why then should we spend needless railway fare?
('68', 373, 3, 10, 703430) Am I wrong in thinking thus or have you changed your opinion?
('68', 373, 3, 11, 703492) Anyway, on my part there will be no restriction on Rajkishori, she can leave whenever she is so inclined.

('68', 373, 8, 16, 703708) MY DEAR IDIOT, Only idiots can think of idiotic interpretation 1 and because you are such a brilliant specimen and agent of the A.I.V.I.A., naturally you will like the rest to belong to your species.
('68', 373, 8, 17, 703908) Heaven help poor metheir guide !
('68', 373, 8, 18, 703941) Do you think anything on earth can be done without trouble?
('68', 373, 8, 19, 704001) You cant do even your unpacking without trouble.
('68', 373, 8, 20, 704050) Then what is the use of your saying that I should redeem my promise to send you honey if it can be done without trouble?
('68', 373, 8, 21, 704171) I tell you that it cannot be done without some trouble.
('68', 373, 8, 22, 704227) But that trouble is going to be taken and honey is being sent.
('68', 373, 8, 23, 704290) You will cover the expense when you next send your cheque.
('68', 373, 8, 24, 704349) The parcels to follow will be sent to you direct from Calcutta or Shillong, V.P.P. if you like.
('68', 373, 8, 25, 704445) You will tell me when you will

('68', 374, 1, 3, 704628) Let all eat this honey, if they prefer it to the Australian.
('68', 374, 1, 4, 704689) I am sure the Shillong honey is any day better than the foreign stuff, if only because it is fresher.
('68', 374, 1, 5, 704791) Your lace, mattress and the reversible sari must be in the box that was being packed for you.
('68', 374, 1, 6, 704885) You must receive it by this time.
('68', 374, 1, 7, 704919) I know there was some bungling about it.
('68', 374, 1, 8, 704960) You are not the only idiot.

('68', 374, 1, 10, 705026) Are you?
('68', 374, 1, 11, 705035) I go tomorrow to Nagpur, probably return on 25th, 27th for certain.
('68', 374, 1, 12, 705103) I go to Segaon, 5 miles from here, on 29th or 30th, returning when required.
('68', 374, 1, 13, 705180) I go with Sardar on 9th May or about the date no Nandi Hill, Mysore.
('68', 374, 1, 14, 705249) Mahadev and others accompany me.
('68', 374, 1, 15, 705282) Or else I would have insisted on Mahadev going to you for a month.
('68', 374, 1, 16, 705349) We descend to Bangalore about 1st June and leave it about 10th June.
('68', 374, 1, 17, 705418) This outing is necessary because Dr. A[nsari] wants Sardar to go to a hill station.
('68', 374, 1, 18, 705502) He would not go without me.
('68', 374, 1, 19, 705530) If I had not to go to Mysore, I would have passed a fortnight with the sister at Panchgani.
('68', 374, 1, 20, 705622) I am sorry to disappoint them.
('68', 374, 1, 21, 705653) Of course I inflict myself on you, if I have to come to Simla.
('68', 374, 1, 22, 705716) I do not think I shall have to just yet.
('68', 374, 1, 23, 705757) As for you, I shall hold you to the three winter months with me and then you will diet yourself under supervision.

('68', 374, 6, 32, 706175) We would be returning about June 10. So, Manu will be staying with you during that period, wont she?
('68', 374, 6, 33, 706276) In June I may perhaps go to settle in a village, where I may have Manu with me.
('68', 374, 6, 34, 706356) However, I do not know whether I could stay there during the monsoon.

('68', 375, 12, 21, 707349) You should work within your capacity.
('68', 375, 12, 22, 707387) Not much may be expected from Tyagi.
('68', 375, 12, 23, 707424) He is a good man but he cannot keep his mind steady.
('68', 375, 12, 24, 707477) You have to take the injections; start on them soon.

('68', 376, 1, 2, 707767) 462. LETTER TO MAHADEV DESAI
('68', 376, 2, 3, 707796) [Before April 23, 1936] 1
('68', 376, 3, 4, 707822) MAHADEV,
('68', 376, 4, 5, 707831) I did expect that you would send Shivprasads letter after making a fair copy.
('68', 376, 4, 6, 707909) It would be good if, in my old age, I could personally teach Vijaya and Manu how to read and write at any rate.
('68', 376, 4, 7, 708021) I, therefore, give some dictation to both of them after the prayer.
('68', 376, 4, 8, 708089) I think that even with my left hand I would write faster than they do, more legibly at any rate.
('68', 376, 4, 9, 708186) But I have found this key for training them, and I am holding on to it.
('68', 376, 4, 10, 708258) My handwriting is none too good, either.
('68', 376, 4, 11, 708299) So I allow the letter as taken down by Vijaya to go, as also the one by Manudi 2. That mission became machine is not so very important.
('68', 376, 4, 12, 708435) But I did sympathize with Shivprasad.
('68', 376, 4, 13, 708473) Although I had expected that you would have a fair copy made if you found it too difficult to read.
('68', 376, 4, 14, 708573) Bablo 3, Durga 4, Prabhudayal or, if free, Kanu could have made a copy.
('68', 376, 4, 15, 708645) I must have presumed some such thing.
('68', 376, 4, 16, 708683) But what can we do, now that the arrow has sped from the bow?
('68', 376, 4, 17, 708745) Let it strike Shivprasad.
('68', 376, 4, 18, 708771) Why should he have asked such questions?
('68', 376, 4, 19, 708812) Kuruvilla is free to send the note prepared by you.
('68', 376, 4, 20, 708864) You will have to accompany me to Hodges.
('68', 376, 4, 21, 708905) Do whatever you can for Daniel Hamilton.
('68', 376, 4, 22, 708946) I will of course try to detain Rajkumari 5. When should we reach Nagpur?
('68', 376, 4, 23, 709019) Decide this if it has not already been done, so that I may know when I will have to leave Segaon.
('68', 376, 4, 24, 709117) Please remember and caution other visitors that the wooden bridge on the longer route has been pulled down.
('68', 376, 4, 25, 709225) Hence cars, etc.
('68', 376, 4, 26, 709242) should not take this route.
('68', 376, 4, 27, 709270) Read Moores 6 letter to Rajkumari and then destroy it.
('68', 376, 4, 28, 709325) Jamnalalji will have arrived before Anandshankarbhai 7 does.
('68', 376, 5, 29, 709386) 1 From the reference to Gandhijis proposed visit to Nagpur and from the contents, this letter appears to have been written before April 23, 1936 when Gandhiji reached Nagpur, presumably to attend the Akhil Bharatiya Sahitya Parishad meeting.

('68', 377, 1, 3, 709926) But do what you think best.
('68', 377, 1, 4, 709954) If there is no reply from Madan Mohan 1, make alternative arrangements for his stay in consultation with Jajuji 2
('68', 377, 2, 5, 710068) or Radhakisan.
('68', 377, 2, 6, 710083) Tikekar is, of course, there.
('68', 377, 2, 7, 710113) He would be comfortable at his place also.
('68', 377, 2, 8, 710156) But he is in bad shape these days.
('68', 377, 2, 9, 710191) Hence it would be better to make some other arrangement.
('68', 377, 2, 10, 710248) I talked to Rambhau and also told him not to have his meals with you.
('68', 377, 2, 11, 710318) I also asked him to leave Wardha immediately.
('68', 377, 2, 12, 710364) But what can I do when you yourself are soft?
('68', 377, 2, 13, 710410) Pyarelal says that he too had scolded him severely.
('68', 377, 2, 14, 710462) You can tell him on my behalf that he may either leave or take his meals anywhere else he wishes.
('68', 377, 2, 15, 710560) I knew nothing about the bangles.

('68', 379, 1, 2, 712442) 466. SPEECH AT AKHIL BHARATIYA SAHITYA PARISHAD
('68', 379, 2, 3, 712490) NAGPUR, April 24, 1936
('68', 379, 3, 4, 712513) Introducing his printed speech to the audience, Gandhiji said he was out of place in a conference of litterateurs especially as he knew better than anyone else that his knowledge of Hindi literature, and even of Gujarati literature, was nothing to speak of, that his knowledge even of Gujarati grammar was indifferent.
('68', 379, 3, 5, 712832) But he had been told that it was an impossible task to get together formidable litterateurs, who were like lions safe enough in their own cages, but difficult to keep together and to be made to work together.
('68', 379, 3, 6, 713041) It had been thought that he as a neutral man and a mahatma might be of some service in bringing them together.
('68', 379, 3, 7, 713152) There he was available to them for what he might be worth, but he wanted to make it clear that he was there simply to initiate the work of bringing [together] the literary men of every province speaking the different languages, and of serving the masses of India by making available to them the best in all the rich languages of our country 1.
('68', 379, 4, 8, 713496) In the course of his extempore speech Gandhiji said that doctors had advised him not to exert himself too much.
('68', 379, 5, 9, 713608) I am here for a brief while for the limited purpose I have told you, but you may know that my heart is neither here nor even in Wardha.
('68', 379, 5, 10, 713744) My heart is in the villages.
('68', 379, 5, 11, 713773) For days I have been striving with the Sardar to let me go to a village near Wardha.
('68', 379, 5, 12, 713858) He is still unconvinced, but my mind wont rest, and God willing, I hope to go and settle in a village near Wardha in a short while.
('68', 379, 5, 13, 713990) But that does not mean that I will not do the work I am doing now, or that I shall cease to be available for consultation to friends, or for advice to those who will seek it.
('68', 379, 5, 14, 714165) Only my address will be a village where I would be living ordinarily.
('68', 379, 5, 15, 714235) I have been asking all my co workers who are doing village work to go and settle in villages and to serve the villagers.
('68', 379, 5, 16, 714356) I feel that I cannot do so effectively until I go and settle in village myself.
('68', 379, 6, 17, 714436) Proceeding, Gandhiji referred to the conflict between Hindi (Hindustani) and Urdu which was due mainly because Hindus and Muslims considered each other as enemies.
('68', 379, 6, 18, 714600) He noticed disputes ever since he returned to India from Africa.
('68', 379, 6, 19, 714665) In fact there was no cause for dispute because even if Muslims took the vow not to use a single

('68', 379, 7, 21, 714817) The following paragraph is from The Hitavada.
('68', 379, 7, 22, 714863) 2 What follows is from Harijan.

('68', 380, 1, 2, 714941) Hindi word they were unable to keep it mainly because the grammatical systems of both were identical.
('68', 380, 1, 3, 715043) Neither could the staunch advocates of Hindi abolish Persian or Urdu words as could be seen from Tulsidass Ramayana which abounded in Persian and Arabic words.
('68', 380, 2, 4, 715203) Gandhiji said that Hindi or Hindustani stood the best chances of becoming Indias lingua franca since it was a comprehensive language and was receptive to outside influences, in that it had absorbed the best from every other literature.
('68', 380, 2, 5, 715439) He favoured simplification of Hindi and deprecated the tendency to Sanskritize it.
('68', 380, 2, 6, 715522) He also urged that all current expressions in different languages should be adopted.
('68', 380, 3, 7, 715607) Proceeding, Gandhiji deplored the tendency to translate Hindi books first into English and then into Bengali or other [languages].
('68', 380, 3, 8, 715738) If they wanted to revive the vernacular, if they wanted to achieve the object they had in view, they must banish English so far as Indian masses were concerned.
('68', 380, 3, 9, 715899) He had no desire to underestimate the value of English which was a universal language and had international significance but Hindustani must become Indias lingua franca and the pernicious notion that they could produce excellent literature only in English must go.
('68', 380, 4, 10, 716164) Gandhiji deplored the present state of things where people were, so to say, in a hide bound way content to remain in their own linguistic and cultural wells, not ready even to acquaint themselves with the language and literature of their neighbouring provinces.
('68', 380, 4, 11, 716426) A handful of our literary men may be studying different provincial literatures and exchanging the treasures of other provincial languages.
('68', 380, 4, 12, 716565) But we had to seek do do more .
('68', 380, 4, 13, 716597) We must not only seek to know the picturesque language of the village folk, but also to spread a knowledge of modern useful literature among the villagers.
('68', 380, 4, 14, 716753) It is a shame that Chaitanyas 3 lyrics are a sealed book to people outside Bengal and Orissa.
('68', 380, 4, 15, 716847) Few of us here may know the name of Tiruvalluvar.
('68', 380, 4, 16, 716897) People in the North are innocent even of the great saints name.
('68', 380, 4, 17, 716961) Few saints have given us treasures of knowledge contained in pithy epigrams as he has done.
('68', 380, 4, 18, 717053) In this context, I can at this moment recall the name only of Tukaram.
('68', 380, 5, 19, 717124) But for that purpose not only the existing literary treasures had to be made available in a language which could be easily learnt by the masses in all the provinces, but even new literature had to be creatednew literature of a healthy and

('68', 381, 0, 1, 717579) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 382
('68', 381, 1, 2, 717621) health giving type.
('68', 381, 2, 3, 717641) If we were to enter the vast field of Indian literature, should we stop somewhere?
('68', 381, 2, 4, 717724) In my opinion there should certainly be a limit.
('68', 381, 2, 5, 717773) I never had the temptation of increasing the number of books.
('68', 381, 2, 6, 717835) I do not consider it necessary that every book written or published in the language of every province should be introduced to all the other languages.
('68', 381, 2, 7, 717986) Even if such an attempt were possible, I think it would be harmful.
('68', 381, 2, 8, 718054) Such interature as fosters unity, morality, valour and such other qualities, and science, should profitably spread to every province.
('68', 381, 3, 9, 718188) Today a plethora of highly objectionable erotic literature seems to be in evidence in every province.
('68', 381, 3, 10, 718290) Indeed, there are some who say that barring the erotic there is no other rasa 3 worth the name; and because the erotic is at a premium, those who insist on restraint in literature are held up to ridicule as devoid of all rasa.
('68', 381, 3, 11, 718517) They forget that even those who are said to sacrifice everything do not sacrifice rasa.
('68', 381, 3, 12, 718605) Each one of us feeds himself on some rasa or sacred passion.
('68', 381, 3, 13, 718666) Dadabhai Naoroji sacrificed everything for the country, but he was fired by the sacred passion of patriotism.
('68', 381, 3, 14, 718776) That gave him all his inner happiness.
('68', 381, 3, 15, 718815) To say that Chaitanya was devoid of rasa is to confess innocence of all rasa.
('68', 381, 3, 16, 718893) Narasinh Mehta, the poet saint of Gujarat, has described himself as a bhogi 4, but his bhoga was that of singleminded devotion to God.
('68', 381, 3, 17, 719028) If you will not be annoyed, I would go to the length of saying that the erotic is the lowest of all rasas, and when it partakes of the obscene it is wholly to be eschewed.
('68', 381, 3, 18, 719200) If I had the power I should taboo all literature calculated to promote communalism, fanaticism and ill will and hatred between individuals, classes or races.
('68', 381, 4, 19, 719358) How can all this be achieved?
('68', 381, 4, 20, 719388) Munshiji and Kakasaheb have cleared our way to a certain extent.
('68', 381, 4, 21, 719453) Literature of wider appeal can only be spread by a widely [spoken] language.
('68', 381, 4, 22, 719530) Hindi Hindustani is such a language compared to the other languages.
('68', 381, 4, 23, 719599) The reason why Hindi is qualified by the word Hindustani is that words originating from the Persian idiom may not be shunned in that language.
('68', 381, 5, 24, 719742) 1 This paragraph is from Harijan.

('68', 382, 1, 2, 720128) The English language can never become the medium for all the provinces.
('68', 382, 1, 3, 720200) If we sincerely hope to enrich Indian literature, to carry the gems hidden in the different languages to the crores of Indian masses, we can do so only through Hindustani.
('68', 382, 1, 4, 720372) It was with this end in view that Munshi started the monthly Hans with the help of the famous writer Premchandji.

('68', 382, 3, 7, 720597) 467. A YOUTHS DIFFICULTY
('68', 382, 4, 8, 720622) A correspondent who prefers to remain anonymous seeks an answer to a question arising out of my article 1 in Harijan addressed to the young.
('68', 382, 4, 9, 720763) Although it is a sound rule to ignore anonymous correspondence, I do sometimes make an exception when the question put is substantial as in the present case.
('68', 382, 4, 10, 720921) The letter is in Hindi and is longer than it need have been.
('68', 382, 4, 11, 720982) Its purport is: From your writing I doubt if you understand the young mind.
('68', 382, 4, 12, 721058) What has been possible for you is not possible for all young men.
('68', 382, 4, 13, 721124) I happen to be married.
('68', 382, 4, 14, 721148) I can restrain myself.
('68', 382, 4, 15, 721171) My wife cannot.
('68', 382, 4, 16, 721187) She does not want children but she does want to enjoy herself.
('68', 382, 4, 17, 721250) What am I to do?
('68', 382, 4, 18, 721267) Is it not my duty to satisfy her?
('68', 382, 4, 19, 721301) I am not generous enough to look upon her satisfying her desire through other channels.
('68', 382, 4, 20, 721389) I read from the papers that you are not averse to promoting marriages and blessing them.
('68', 382, 4, 21, 721478) Surely you know or ought to know that they are not contracted with the high purpose that you have mentioned.
('68', 382, 4, 22, 721587) The correspondent is right.
('68', 382, 4, 23, 721615) The fact that I bless so many marriages, when they satisfy the tests that I have set as to age, economy, etc., perhaps shows somewhat that I know the youth of the country to an extent that would justify my guiding them when they seek my guidance.
('68', 382, 4, 24, 721862) My correspondents case is typical.
('68', 382, 4, 25, 721897) He deserves sympathy.
('68', 382, 4, 26, 721919) That the sole purpose of sexual connection is procreation is in the nature of a new discovery for me.
('68', 382, 4, 27, 722021) Though I had known the rule, I had never before given it the weight it deserved.
('68', 382, 4, 28, 722102) I must have till recently

('68', 383, 0, 1, 722161) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 384
('68', 383, 1, 2, 722203) regarded it as a mere pious wish.
('68', 383, 1, 3, 722237) I now regard it as a fundamental law of married state which is easy of observance if its paramount importance is duly recognized.
('68', 383, 1, 4, 722367) My object will be fulfilled when the law is given its due place in society.
('68', 383, 1, 5, 722443) To me it is a living law.
('68', 383, 1, 6, 722469) We break it always and pay heavily for its breach.
('68', 383, 1, 7, 722520) If my correspondent realizes its inestimable value and if he has love for her and has faith in himself, he will convert his wife to his view.
('68', 383, 1, 8, 722662) Is he sincere when he says he can restrain himself?
('68', 383, 1, 9, 722714) Has the animal passion become transmuted in his case into a higher passion, say, for service of fellow beings?
('68', 383, 1, 10, 722825) Does he naturally refrain from doing anything to excite the passion in his wife?
('68', 383, 1, 11, 722906) Let him know that Hindu science denotes eight kinds of unious which include sexual suggestions made even by signs.
('68', 383, 1, 12, 723021) Is the correspondent free from these?
('68', 383, 1, 13, 723059) If he is not 1 and if he is sincerely desirous that his wife should be weaned from the sexual desire, let him surround her with the purest love, let him explain the law to her, let him explain the physical effects of union without the desire for procreation, let him tell her what the vital fluid means.
('68', 383, 1, 14, 723363) Let him further engage his wife in healthy pursuits and strive to regulate her diet, exercise etc., so as to still the passion in her.
('68', 383, 1, 15, 723498) Above all, if he is a man of religion he will try to transmit to his companion his own living faith.
('68', 383, 1, 16, 723599) For I must confess that the observance of the law of continence is impossible without a living faith in God which is living Truth.
('68', 383, 1, 17, 723730) It is the fashion nowadays to dismiss God from life altogether and insist on the possibility of reaching the highest kind of life without the necessity of a living faith in a living God.
('68', 383, 1, 18, 723917) I must confess my inability to drive the truth of the law home to those who have no faith in and no need for a Power infinitely higher than themselves.
('68', 383, 1, 19, 724069) My own experience has led me to the knowledge that fullest life is impossible without an immovable belief in a living Law in obedience to which the whole universe moves.
('68', 383, 1, 20, 724239) A man without that faith is like a drop thrown out of the ocean bound to perish.
('68', 383, 1, 21, 724320) Every drop in the ocean shares its majesty and has the honour of giving us the ozone of life.

('68', 385, 4, 5, 725849) I cannot come tomorrow.
('68', 385, 4, 6, 725873) The W.C. is still sitting and I cannot leave so long as the members are here.
('68', 385, 4, 7, 725951) In no case shall I have uninterrupted 10 days there.
('68', 385, 4, 8, 726004) I must be here no Sunday and also for 1st and 2nd May, if Dr. Ambedkar comes.
('68', 385, 4, 9, 726082) 1 Then I have to be absent from 5th or 6th.
('68', 385, 4, 10, 726126) I expect to leave for Bangalore on 8th.
('68', 385, 4, 11, 726166) Therefore there will be no returning after I leave on 5th or 6th.
('68', 385, 4, 12, 726232) So the ten days will be reduced to 30th, 31st and 4th and 5th May, the latter only possibly.
('68', 385, 4, 13, 726325) I shall be thankful even if I can be there even to that extent.

('68', 385, 9, 19, 726540) I have your letter.
('68', 385, 9, 20, 726560) If you take hip baths, live on fruit juice and have massages, I have no doubt that you will be rid of your complaint.
('68', 385, 9, 21, 726678) For you garlic is not the best cure.
('68', 385, 9, 22, 726715) Partial fasting, as I have explained above, is the only way you can get rid of the excess fator whatever you call itin your body.
('68', 385, 9, 23, 726845) It is possible that your system does not take kindly to fruit, in which case you will have to live on water.
('68', 385, 9, 24, 726954) You will definitely return a cured person if you go to Poona and get yourself treated by Dr. Mehta.
('68', 385, 9, 25, 727054) It is all right if Shankerlal does not come.
('68', 385, 9, 26, 727099) He should improve his health there.

('68', 387, 2, 3, 728599) SEGAON, ,
('68', 387, 3, 4, 728609) April 29/30, 1936 1
('68', 387, 4, 5, 728629) BHAI BAPA, I have written to Chimandas.
('68', 387, 4, 6, 728669) To Choithram 2 I wrote from Lucknow itself.
('68', 387, 4, 7, 728713) The case of Amtussalaam is a difficult one.
('68', 387, 4, 8, 728757) She is not going to be happy with me, too, and I am now going to settle in a village.
('68', 387, 4, 9, 728843) For the present, however, I am going to Nandi Durg with Sardar.
('68', 387, 4, 10, 728907) He has been confined and I am banding jailor to him; I mean he is ill and I am to act as his number I am prepared to take Amtussalaam there.
('68', 387, 4, 11, 729048) It is not good morning away from Rukmini's harassment of her.
('68', 387, 4, 12, 729110) That women encourage her in her ways.
('68', 387, 4, 13, 729148) We must find out a way to reform Rukmini.
('68', 387, 4, 14, 729190) Therefore, consider Amtussalaam's case in this way.
('68', 387, 4, 15, 729242) Is it necessary to have her there?
('68', 387, 4, 16, 729277) If it is so, keep her there and clip Rukmini's wings.
('68', 387, 4, 17, 729331) If she is not needed she should be sent to me forthwith.
('68', 387, 4, 18, 729388) I sent her there with a view to satisfying her ambition to serve and under the belief that she was needed there.
('68', 387, 4, 19, 729501) She is certainly not to be accommodated on the assumption that work may be taken from whoever is there.
('68', 387, 4, 20, 729605) You are fully entitled to do what you think right after looking at the question from this angle.
('68', 387, 4, 21, 729702) I am enclosing her letter herewith.
('68', 387, 4, 22, 729738) Now about Sastri.
('68', 387, 4, 23, 729756) He was here and talked about many things.
('68', 387, 4, 24, 729798) His mention of Ganesan's abuses is only an excuse.
('68', 387, 4, 25, 729849) He is tired of the work because he has no energy to raise the funds.
('68', 387, 4, 26, 729918) On my part I am disappointed about him.
('68', 387, 4, 27, 729958) I believe he is fit for specified desk work and can perhaps maintain accounts and carry on correspondence well.
('68', 387, 4, 28, 730070) But he has not the ability to run an institution.
('68', 387, 4, 29, 730120) He lacks initiative, has no self confidence, no interest in the work, no such thing as drive.
('68', 387, 4, 30, 730214) However, he is a good man and he is honest.
('68', 387, 4, 31, 730258) I advise you, therefore, to relieve him from the Kumbhakonam work and entrust the burden to Bhashyam Iyengar.
('68', 387, 4, 32, 730368) Let him do as he wishes.
('68', 387, 4, 33, 730393) As for Pratapmal, Jagannath Das may take him on if he wants to, but we should not shoulder the burden of expenditure.
('68', 387, 4, 34, 730511) He may carry on by raising funds from Madras or any other place he likes.
('68', 387, 4, 35, 730585) In no case can Ganesan continue.
('68', 387, 4, 36, 730618) You might share the burden to any extent you
('68', 387, 5, 37, 730663) 1 Gandhiji began this letter on April 29 and completed it the next day.

('68', 388, 1, 2, 730801) choose provided Bhashyam Iyengar and Venkatasubbayya can shoulder the responsibility.
('68', 388, 1, 3, 730887) You should boldly settle the matter as you wish.
('68', 388, 1, 4, 730936) See that in whatever you do Sastri and Ganesan are carefully kept out.
('68', 388, 1, 5, 731007) Sastri may be accommodated anywhere else.
('68', 388, 1, 6, 731049) I wish you should no more burden me on his account.
('68', 388, 1, 7, 731101) My heart turns towards the villages.
('68', 388, 1, 8, 731138) I wrote the part concerning Amtussalaam at Wardha and then had to leave it incomplete as visitors came up.
('68', 388, 1, 9, 731245) Now I complete it today, the second day, here at Segaon which is five miles from Wardha.
('68', 388, 1, 10, 731334) You should take it that I have settled finally when I return here from Bangalore.
('68', 388, 1, 11, 731416) Till then you may regard it as the Mahatma's imposture.
('68', 388, 1, 12, 731472) It is not that Sardar is taking me to Nandi Durg, I am taking him there.
('68', 388, 1, 13, 731545) Is it not enough, considering that I have not written to you for a long time, that I wrote all this from a village on country made paper with a country made reed pen and country made ink?
('68', 388, 1, 14, 731733) I got a long letter from Amtussalaam.
('68', 388, 1, 15, 731771) I am enclosing my reply 1
('68', 388, 2, 16, 731797) to her, which you should read to her.

('68', 388, 7, 21, 732003) MY DEAR AGATHA, I have your letter of 17th instant.
('68', 388, 7, 22, 732055) Nothing less was to be expected of Jawaharlal.
('68', 388, 7, 23, 732102) His address 2 is a confession of his faith.
('68', 388, 7, 24, 732146) You see from the formation of his cabinet that he has chosen a majority of those who represent the traditional view, i.e., from 1920. Of course the majority represent my view.
('68', 388, 7, 25, 732322) I would love to kill the New Constitution 3
('68', 388, 8, 26, 732366) 1 This is not available.

('68', 389, 1, 2, 732537) today if I can.
('68', 389, 1, 3, 732553) There is hardly anything in it I like.
('68', 389, 1, 4, 732592) But Jawaharlal's way is not my way.
('68', 389, 1, 5, 732628) I accept his ideal about land, etc.
('68', 389, 1, 6, 732664) But I do not accept practically any of his methods.
('68', 389, 1, 7, 732716) I would strain every nerve to prevent a class war.
('68', 389, 1, 8, 732767) So would he, I expect.
('68', 389, 1, 9, 732790) But he does not believe it to be possible to avoid it.
('68', 389, 1, 10, 732845) I believe it to be perfectly possible especially if my method is accepted.
('68', 389, 1, 11, 732920) But though Jawaharlal is extreme in his presentation of his methods, he is sober in action.
('68', 389, 1, 12, 733012) So far as I know him, he will not precipitate a conflict nor will he shirk it if it is forced on him.
('68', 389, 1, 13, 733114) But there perhaps the whole Congress is not of one mind.
('68', 389, 1, 14, 733171) A difference there certainly is.
('68', 389, 1, 15, 733204) My method is designed to avoid conflict.
('68', 389, 1, 16, 733245) His is not so designed.
('68', 389, 1, 17, 733269) My own feeling is that Jawaharlal will accept the decisions of the majority of his colleagues.
('68', 389, 1, 18, 733364) For a man of his temperament, this is most difficult.
('68', 389, 1, 19, 733418) He is finding it so already.
('68', 389, 1, 20, 733447) Whatever he does he will do it nobly.
('68', 389, 1, 21, 733485) Though the gulf between us as to the outlook upon life has undoubtedly widened, we have never been so near each other in hearts as we perhaps are today.
('68', 389, 1, 22, 733638) This is not for public use but you are at liberty to show it to friends.
('68', 389, 1, 23, 733711) I do not suppose you want anything more in answer to your question.

('68', 390, 8, 13, 734955) I understand what you say about money.
('68', 390, 8, 14, 734994) Of course, your fathers letter is excellent and I noted what he had to say about giving you money.
('68', 390, 8, 15, 735093) Inform him that I have sent it.
('68', 390, 8, 16, 735125) It is all right if you have given up milk for health reasons.
('68', 390, 8, 17, 735187) But you are not to undertake any experiment with a view to giving up milk.
('68', 390, 8, 18, 735262) The fit was probably due to your going without milk.
('68', 390, 8, 19, 735315) You are not to worry at all.
('68', 390, 8, 20, 735344) As long as you have your parents blessings and they have not the least dissatisfaction about you, what have you to worry about?
('68', 390, 8, 21, 735472) How does it matter what the world says?
('68', 390, 8, 22, 735512) You alone have to settle your account with Jayaprakash.
('68', 390, 8, 23, 735568) His is a different case.
('68', 390, 8, 24, 735593) Hence it will not do if you fall ill under the stress of worry.
('68', 390, 8, 25, 735657) The true follower of the Gita is one who can remain calm and composed in any situation whatever, and you have to become such a one.
('68', 390, 8, 26, 735789) For the present, write to me regularly.
('68', 390, 8, 27, 735829) Jayaprakash came to see me yesterday; Patwardhan was with him.
('68', 390, 8, 28, 735892) He spoke to me about your future although he said nothing in reply to my letter.
('68', 390, 8, 29, 735973) He said he wished to put you for three months at the school in Banaras where, he said, you might learn the Montessorie method.
('68', 390, 8, 30, 736100) Then he mentioned Patna and asked my opinion about it.
('68', 390, 8, 31, 736155) I told him I had no objection to the proposal.
('68', 390, 8, 32, 736202) You should have the

('68', 391, 5, 14, 736997) April 30, 1936 2
('68', 391, 6, 15, 737014) Don't you think, Bapu, the worker asked, rather than bury yourself in this village, you should undertake a tour through the country, just for the rural reconstruction programme?
('68', 391, 6, 16, 737192) I cannot tell you what a godsend that Harijan tour 3 was, how it worked a silent revolution in people's minds.
('68', 391, 6, 17, 737303) Nothing else could have achieved it.
('68', 391, 6, 18, 737340) Couldn't you take a tour like that?
('68', 391, 7, 19, 737376) [G.] Oh, no.
('68', 391, 7, 20, 737389) There is no similarity between the two cases.
('68', 391, 7, 21, 737435) In Harijan work the practical and the theoretical aspects were combined.
('68', 391, 7, 22, 737508) Here I cannot combine the two.
('68', 391, 7, 23, 737539) I have been talking theory all these days, talking and giving advice on village work, without having personally come to grips with the difficulties of village work.
('68', 391, 7, 24, 737704) If I undertook the tour, say, after passing three seasons in a village and among the villagers, a year hence I should be able to talk with knowledge and experience which I have not got today.
('68', 391, 7, 25, 737896) Yesterday I went to Sindi to see how Gajanan Naik was working.
('68', 391, 7, 26, 737959) The condition of things there is scarcely better but he is carrying on his work, patiently and perseveringly.

('68', 392, 6, 9, 738624) I have read it with the deepest interest.
('68', 392, 6, 10, 738666) You have a tough problem in front of you.
('68', 392, 6, 11, 738708) If you can, you should come to Nandi Hill to see me.
('68', 392, 6, 12, 738761) I reach there on 10th May, D.V. God will guide you.
('68', 392, 6, 13, 738813) You must not worry.
('68', 392, 6, 14, 738833) Take things as they come to you when you cannot alter them.

('68', 393, 3, 4, 739820) MY DEAR REBEL, You won't be a rebel if you were not an idiot.
('68', 393, 3, 5, 739882) So it is always a question which title suits you most.
('68', 393, 3, 6, 739937) And since no one can take titles for oneself and Rebel is your choice, I suppose I should prefer the use of Idiot.
('68', 393, 3, 7, 740052) But though called Tyrant I pamper you so that the rebel of today may be a willing slave of tomorrow.

('68', 393, 3, 9, 740183) Pyarelal is with me.
('68', 393, 3, 10, 740204) I wanted him.
('68', 393, 3, 11, 740218) Ba was to have come but she was unwell.
('68', 393, 3, 12, 740258) You will be glad to learn that I walked almost the whole distance.
('68', 393, 3, 13, 740325) I was none the worse for it.
('68', 393, 3, 14, 740354) I took the bandi 1 for the remaining 3 4 of a mile because we had missed the way and the others were getting uneasy about me.

('68', 394, 1, 4, 741547) Ultimately in the matter of dharma, too, the final authority is neither the Vedas nor the Gita nor the Bhagavata; the sole authority is our own unflinching faith and the resultant understanding.
('68', 394, 1, 5, 741742) This is what I mean when I say solely due to Kaka's greatness.
('68', 394, 2, 6, 741805) He taught you both brothers Gujarati without reservations and, moreover, brought you up in Gujarat.
('68', 394, 2, 7, 741905) Had he been narrow minded he would [not] have let you speak any other language and would have had you brought up somewhere in Maharashtra.

('68', 394, 8, 25, 742624) It is likely that there was not so much carelessness as a feeling of shame.
('68', 394, 8, 26, 742700) If so, such shame, too, ought to be given up.
('68', 394, 8, 27, 742746) You should put your time to good use.

('68', 395, 12, 25, 744215) From a serious discussion I had with a sister 2 I fear that my position on the use of contraceptives has not yet been sufficiently understood.
('68', 395, 12, 26, 744358) My opposition is not due to their having come to us from the West.
('68', 395, 12, 27, 744425) I thankfully use some Western things when I know that they

('68', 396, 1, 2, 744640) benefit us as they benefit those in the West.
('68', 396, 1, 3, 744686) My opposition to contraceptives is based on merits.
('68', 396, 1, 4, 744738) I take it that the wisest among the protagonists of contraceptives restrict their use to married women who desire to satisfy their and their husbands' sexual appetite without wanting children.
('68', 396, 1, 5, 744931) I hold this desire as unnatural in the human species and its satisfaction detrimental to the spiritual progress of the human family.
('68', 396, 1, 6, 745064) As against this is often cited the following testimony among others of Lord Dawson of Penn: 1
('68', 396, 2, 7, 745158) Sex love is one of the clamant, dominating forces of the world.
('68', 396, 2, 8, 745222) You may guide it into healthy channels but an outlet it will have, and if that outlet is inadequate or unduly obstructed, irregular channels will be forced.
('68', 396, 2, 9, 745379) Self control has a breaking point, and if in any community marriage is difficult or late of attainment, an increase of irregular unions will inevitably result.
('68', 396, 3, 10, 745539) Sex love has, apart from parenthood, a purport of its own.
('68', 396, 3, 11, 745598) It is an essential part of health and happiness in marriage.
('68', 396, 3, 12, 745659) The attainment of mutual and reciprocal joy in their relations constitutes a firm bond between two people and makes for durability of their marriage tie.
('68', 396, 4, 13, 745813) I will pass on to consider the all important question of birth control .
('68', 396, 4, 14, 745886) The reasons which lead parents to limit their offspring are sometimes selfish, but more often honourable and cogent.
('68', 396, 4, 15, 746003) The desire to marry and to rear children well equipped for life's struggle, limited incomes, the cost of living, burdensome taxation, are forcible motives.
('68', 396, 4, 16, 746159) Absence of birth control means late marriages and these carry with them irregular unions and all the baneful consequences.
('68', 396, 4, 17, 746282) But say many, Birth control may be necessary, but the only birth control which is justifiable is voluntary abstention. Such abstention would be either ineffective or, if effective, impracticable and harmful to health and happiness.
('68', 396, 4, 18, 746514) To limit the size of a family to, say, four children, would be to impose on a married couple an amount of abstention which for long period would almost be equivalent to celibacy, and when one remembers that owing to economic reasons the abstention would have to be most strict during the earlier years of married life when desires are strongest, I maintain a demand is being made which, for the mass of people it is impossible to meet; that the endeavours to meet it would impose a strain hostile to health and happiness and carry with them grave dangers to morals .
('68', 396, 4, 19, 747081) Lord Dawson's eminence is not to be denied.
('68', 396, 4, 20, 747125) But with all due respect to his greatness as a physician, I am tempted to question the
('68', 396, 5, 21, 747212) 1 Only extracts from the quotation are reproduced here.
('68', 397, 0, 1, 747268) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 398
('68', 397, 1, 2, 747310) value of his evidence, specially when it is pitted against the experience of men and women who have lived a life of continence without suffering any moral or physical harm.
('68', 397, 1, 3, 747483) Physicians generally come across those who have so defied laws of health that they have contracted some illness.
('68', 397, 1, 4, 747596) They, therefore, often successfully prescribe what sufferers should do to become well, but they cannot always know what healthy men and women can do in any particular direction.
('68', 397, 1, 5, 747774) Lord Dawson's evidence, therefore, about the effect of continence on married people has to be taken with the greatest caution.
('68', 397, 1, 6, 747901) No doubt the tendency among married people is to regard sexual satisfaction for itself as legitimate.
('68', 397, 1, 7, 748003) But in the modern age in which nothing is taken for granted and everything is rightly scrutinized, it is surely wrong to take it for granted that because we have hitherto indulged in the sexual appetite in married life, the practice is either legitimate or healthy.
('68', 397, 1, 8, 748269) Many old practices have been discontinued with good results.
('68', 397, 1, 9, 748330) Why should this particular practice be exempt from examination especially in the light of the experience of those who even as married men and women are living a life of restraint with mutual benefit both physical and moral?
('68', 397, 1, 10, 748554) But I object to contraceptives also on special grounds in India.
('68', 397, 1, 11, 748619) Young men in India do not know what sexual restraint is.
('68', 397, 1, 12, 748676) It is not their fault.
('68', 397, 1, 13, 748699) They are married early.
('68', 397, 1, 14, 748723) It is the custom.
('68', 397, 1, 15, 748741) Nobody tells them to exercise restraint in married life.
('68', 397, 1, 16, 748798) Parents are impatient to see grandchildren.
('68', 397, 1, 17, 748842) The poor girl wives are expected by their surroun dings to bear children as fast as they can.
('68', 397, 1, 18, 748936) In such surroundings, the use of contraceptives can only further aggravate the mischief.
('68', 397, 1, 19, 749025) The poor girls who are expected to submit to their husbands' desires are now to be taught that it is a good thing to desire sexual satisfaction without the desire to have children.
('68', 397, 1, 20, 749206) And in order to fulfil the double purpose they are to have recourse to contraceptives !!!
('68', 397, 1, 21, 749296) I regard this to be most pernicious education for married women.
('68', 397, 1, 22, 749361) I do not believe that woman is prey to sexual desire to the same extent as man.
('68', 397, 1, 23, 749441) It is easier for her than for man to exercise self restraint.
('68', 397, 1, 24, 749503) I hold that the right education in this country is to teach woman the art of saying no even to her husband, to teach her that it is not part of her duty to become a mere tool or a doll in her husbands hands.
('68', 397, 1, 25, 749711) She has rights as well as duties.
('68', 397, 1, 26, 749745) Those who see in Sita a willing slave under Rama do not realize the loftiness of either her independence or Rama's consideration for her in everything.
('68', 397, 1, 27, 749897) Sita was no helpless weak woman incapable of protecting herself or her

('68', 398, 1, 2, 750014) honour.
('68', 398, 1, 3, 750022) To ask India's women to take to contraceptives is, to say the least, putting the cart before the horse.
('68', 398, 1, 4, 750126) The first thing is to free her from mental slavery, to teach her the sacredness of her body and to teach her the dignity of national service and the service of humanity.
('68', 398, 1, 5, 750296) It is not fair to assume that India's women are beyond redemption and that they have therefore to be simply taught the use of contraceptives for the sake of preventing births and preserving such health as they may be in possession of.
('68', 398, 1, 6, 750531) Let not the sisters who are rightly indignant over the miseries of women who are called upon to bear children whether they will or no, be impatient.
('68', 398, 1, 7, 750680) Not even the propaganda in favour of contraceptives is going to promote the desired end overnight.
('68', 398, 1, 8, 750779) Every method is a matter of education.
('68', 398, 1, 9, 750818) My plea is for the right type.

('68', 398, 5, 13, 750924) MY DEAR MUJEEB 1,
('68', 398, 6, 14, 750942) You were quite right in writing to me as you did.
('68', 398, 6, 15, 750992) Aqil must have given you a full account of what I did and what happened.
('68', 398, 6, 16, 751065) As your letter 2 is so good and so important, I propose to publish it without your name and answer it in the columns of Harijan.
('68', 398, 6, 17, 751194) 3 I hope you will see the answer.
('68', 398, 6, 18, 751228) If it does not satisfy you, you will not hesitate to write again.
('68', 398, 6, 19, 751294) I want to give you complete satisfaction if I at all can.
('68', 398, 6, 20, 751352) There are parts of your letter where you have made mistakes.
('68', 398, 6, 21, 751413) My love to all whom I know.

('68', 399, 10, 15, 752118) We already have in our hands the work of Harijan Sevak; other kinds of service of Harijans are carried on everywhere.
('68', 399, 10, 16, 752236) Now a third cause has come up.
('68', 399, 10, 17, 752267) As desired by Jamnalalji the Hindi Sammelan has entrusted the work of Hindi propagation to a special committee which will have Wardha as its headquarters.
('68', 399, 10, 18, 752422) We all want you to be the secretary of that committee.
('68', 399, 10, 19, 752477) We have Baba Raghavdas 2, too, in mind.
('68', 399, 10, 20, 752517) Can he not leave Gorakhpur?
('68', 399, 10, 21, 752545) Do you like this work?
('68', 399, 10, 22, 752568) Would you like to come over to Wardha?
('68', 399, 10, 23, 752607) Can you leave your work of Harijan education without any harm?
('68', 399, 10, 24, 752670) If not, do you know anyone who is a lover of Hindi and can handle the work of a secretary and who is also willing to stay in Wardha?

('68', 400, 2, 3, 753014) May 2, 1936
('68', 400, 3, 4, 753026) BAPA, I have carefully gone through your circular letter regarding the Harijans of Tiruchengodu.
('68', 400, 3, 5, 753123) What may we do in such a case?
('68', 400, 3, 6, 753154) The money given is in a way the price paid for proselytization and, in a way, it is not so either.
('68', 400, 3, 7, 753253) To fill the belly man resorts to forced labour and flattery.
('68', 400, 3, 8, 753314) The remedy could be only one.
('68', 400, 3, 9, 753344) Let us remove their sufferings.
('68', 400, 3, 10, 753376) But these our men in Tiruchengodu are attached to money and therefore in such cases we are helpless.
('68', 400, 3, 11, 753477) They would soon come over to our side if we paid them more.
('68', 400, 3, 12, 753537) But this would be an unprofitable trade.
('68', 400, 3, 13, 753578) Therefore what is unavoidable thou shouldst not regret. 1 All the same, wisdom would consist in doing what Rajaji says since he is a man with experience of the place.
('68', 400, 3, 14, 753745) I do not write to him because you have already written.
('68', 400, 3, 15, 753801) Your letter had not reached me when he was in Wardha.
('68', 400, 3, 16, 753855) I have already written to you how the question of Amtussalaam is to be solved.
('68', 400, 4, 17, 753934) Read my letter to Viyogi Hari and give it to him if you think it right.
('68', 400, 4, 18, 754006) I mean it is no use giving him the letter if you are sure you cannot relieve him.
('68', 400, 4, 19, 754088) It will be possible to make full use of him here if it cannot be done there.

('68', 401, 10, 16, 755300) I like him.
('68', 401, 10, 17, 755312) He has good poetic promise and is keen on improving it.
('68', 401, 10, 18, 755368) The family seems to be good.
('68', 401, 10, 19, 755397) I visited the site of the memorial.
('68', 401, 10, 20, 755433) I could not know what they were now doing there.

('68', 402, 1, 2, 755910) 494. SPEECH AT A.I.V.I.A. EXHIBITION 1
('68', 402, 2, 3, 755949) WARDHA, May 3, 1936 2
('68', 402, 3, 4, 755971) As I was coming to Maganwadi I saw the weekly bazaar that is held here every Sunday.
('68', 402, 3, 5, 756056) That bazaar has the raw produce as well as manufactures from raw produce exhibited in abundance.
('68', 402, 3, 6, 756153) This exhibition has these exhibited on a very humble scale.
('68', 402, 3, 7, 756213) I therefore wondered how our exhibition compared with the weekly bazaar.
('68', 402, 3, 8, 756286) The fundamental difference is that the exhibition is held entirely with a view to service of the village and the townsfolk, whereas the bazaar is a business concern in which the villager is exploited.
('68', 402, 3, 9, 756487) He is made to sell his wares as cheap as possible, often even below cost price.
('68', 402, 3, 10, 756567) At this exhibition there is hardly any buying and selling.
('68', 402, 3, 11, 756626) This exhibition is an attempt to educate the residents of Wardha in their duty towards the villages surrounding them and to educate the villagers in what is possible for them to better themselves in every way.
('68', 402, 3, 12, 756836) The exhibition teaches them how to keep their villages clean, what food to eat and how to improve their industries and thus earn a little more than they do today.
('68', 402, 3, 13, 756999) So far as the town dweller in concerned the exhibiton forcibly brings to his mind the various ways in which he is exploiting the villager, and how best he may serve the villager by going in for his wares.
('68', 402, 3, 14, 757204) The Lucknow Exhibition opened the eyes of those who visited it to the wonderful capacity of our village craftsman, and even this will do so somewhat.
('68', 402, 3, 15, 757354) I may tell you here that though the admission here has been kept free, at Lucknow it was not free.
('68', 402, 3, 16, 757453) Reports have been published that the exhibition there resulted in a heavy loss.
('68', 402, 3, 17, 757533) They are wrong.
('68', 402, 3, 18, 757549) The receipts from the sale of tickets exceeded Rs. 25,000. There were, besides, receipts from stall holders.
('68', 402, 3, 19, 757658) It is just possible that there will be a nominal profit.
('68', 402, 3, 20, 757715) Those around Lucknow will not see such an exhibition in Lucknow for years to come.
('68', 402, 3, 21, 757798) The Kumbh Mela recurs at long but regular intervals.
('68', 402, 3, 22, 757851) The Congress and the Exhibition may not be held again at the same place, and even if it is, it may be held at an indefinitely long interval, especially because the tendency, I

('68', 403, 1, 2, 758215) hope, now will be to select not big cities but small towns for their venue.
('68', 403, 1, 3, 758291) But local exhibitions like this should be inexpensive annual efforts of growingly educative value.
('68', 403, 1, 4, 758390) The village oilman has, for instance, deteriorated nowadays.
('68', 403, 1, 5, 758451) He adulterates the oil with cheap and spurious stuffs.
('68', 403, 1, 6, 758506) He will learn here how it is profitable to make the oil absolutely pure and unadulterated.
('68', 403, 1, 7, 758597) The paper maker will learn here how to make the paper neat and lasting.
('68', 403, 1, 8, 758669) As time goes we should be able to show improvements in these processes.
('68', 403, 1, 9, 758741) I know that we have been able to produce little effect, during the year, on our surroundings or on the villages in the neighbourhood.
('68', 403, 1, 10, 758875) But that does not disappoint me.
('68', 403, 1, 11, 758908) We have to plod on.
('68', 403, 1, 12, 758928) Those of you who have come here have to go forth to the villages as advertising agents and to draw the villagers to such exhibitions.
('68', 403, 1, 13, 759062) The tragedy today is that the town dweller is becoming increasingly indifferent to the villages, that he even believes that the villages are going to be destroyed in the near future.
('68', 403, 1, 14, 759245) They certainly will be if we continue to prefer mill made articles to hand made.
('68', 403, 1, 15, 759326) Those of you who have come here have to go out as preachers of the gospel of rural mindedness.
('68', 403, 1, 16, 759421) A factory employs a few hundreds and renders thousands unemployed.
('68', 403, 1, 17, 759488) I may produce tons of oil from an oil mill, but I also drive thousands of oilmen out of employment.
('68', 403, 1, 18, 759588) I call this destructive energy, whereas production by the labour of millions of hands is constructive and conductive to the common good.
('68', 403, 1, 19, 759725) 1 Mass production through power driven machinery, even when Stateowned, will be of on avail.
('68', 403, 1, 20, 759818) But why not, it is asked, save the labour of millions and give them more leisure for intellectual pursuits?
('68', 403, 1, 21, 759926) Leisure is good and necessary up to a point only.
('68', 403, 1, 22, 759976) God created man to eat his bread by the sweat of his brow, and I dread the prospect of our being able to produce all that we wnt, including our Food stuffs, out of a conjurer's hat.

('68', 403, 3, 24, 760177) 1 The report in The Bombay Chronicle, 5 5 1936, here has: The method of production of necessaries through power driven machinery displacing tens of thousands of men and providing prolonged leisure was, in his opinion, asuric, whereas the ancient method of production by human labour in co operation was daivic that is to say, conducive to the progress of humanity.
('68', 403, 3, 25, 760542) The ancient method had its effects.
('68', 403, 3, 26, 760578) The All India Village Industries Association was endeavouring to remedy the evil and exhibitions were a method of encompassing that end.

('68', 404, 10, 29, 761886) I am sure you came across Vinoba's brother, Balkrishna, at the Ashram.
('68', 404, 10, 30, 761957) He is a learned man, well versed in music, too, but his health has run down.
('68', 404, 10, 31, 762034) He loves solitude and may not be able to stand

('68', 405, 1, 2, 762216) I wish he could use a quiet room in Gopnath or whatever the place is called.
('68', 405, 1, 3, 762293) I have written to Bhai Jivanlal 1 to see if accommodation can be found for him at Chorwad.
('68', 405, 1, 4, 762384) I am in Segaon and Mahadev [will be] in Bombay.
('68', 405, 1, 5, 762432) I am taking Sardar to Nandi Durg on the 8th.
('68', 405, 1, 6, 762477) May I, therefore, ask for a reply by wire if this reaches you in time?
('68', 405, 1, 7, 762548) I hope you are quite well.
('68', 405, 2, 8, 762575) Vandemataram from MOHANDAS [PS.] Please address the mail to Wardha.

('68', 405, 5, 11, 762758) SEGAON, May 5, 1936
('68', 405, 6, 12, 762778) MY DEAR IDIOT,
('68', 405, 7, 13, 762793) Surely by this time you have had more than one letter from Segaon.
('68', 405, 7, 14, 762860) I am sure in a day or two you would have begun to like the place and the life.
('68', 405, 7, 15, 762939) Ba came with me yesterday.
('68', 405, 7, 16, 762966) I walked the whole distance.
('68', 405, 7, 17, 762995) It took me full two hours.
('68', 405, 7, 18, 763022) But then we again missed the way a little.
('68', 405, 7, 19, 763065) We were all novices without a guide.
('68', 405, 7, 20, 763102) And I was silent.
('68', 405, 7, 21, 763120) I can comfortably do the whole distance on 1 3 4 hours.
('68', 405, 7, 22, 763176) I was none the worse
('68', 405, 8, 23, 763197) for the walk and was ready for the evening walk.
('68', 405, 8, 24, 763246) Mahadev and Lilavati walked in at 8.30 p.m., and slept on the ground where the operations are going on.
('68', 405, 8, 25, 763350) We all sleep there, surrounded on all sides by double trenches supported by the excavated earth.
('68', 405, 8, 26, 763447) We eat the vegetables grown here.
('68', 405, 8, 27, 763481) We do not therefore get a variety but there is more than compensation in the thought that we are taking what is grown locally.
('68', 405, 8, 28, 763608) This restriction, if persisted in, will soon induce a cultivation of other vegetables.
('68', 405, 8, 29, 763695) So much for Segaon.
('68', 405, 8, 30, 763715) Now for the parcel from Lucknow.
('68', 405, 8, 31, 763748) You wrote to me the other day saying you had advice of despatch of parcel by Miss Ala worth
('68', 405, 9, 32, 763840) 1 Jivanlal Motichand Shah who helped Gandhiji financially in his khadi and Harijan welfare work.

('68', 406, 1, 2, 763983) over Rs. 600. You even hoped that it won't contain the khes you had sent.
('68', 406, 1, 3, 764057) Where is that parcel?
('68', 406, 1, 4, 764079) Instructions together with addresses were duly passed.
('68', 406, 1, 5, 764134) But everything was topsy turvy.
('68', 406, 1, 6, 764166) All were overworked.
('68', 406, 1, 7, 764187) I am sorry about the parcel having gone to Simla.
('68', 406, 1, 8, 764237) I know what worry it is to have things wrongly addressed.
('68', 406, 1, 9, 764295) I had spoken to Khurshed more than once and then to Jerajani 1. Let us see what finally happens.
('68', 406, 1, 10, 764392) You need not send your cheque before the receipt of the parcels.
('68', 406, 1, 11, 764457) By way of curiosity I would like to know how much extra the wrong address has cost.
('68', 406, 1, 12, 764541) I am sure you should accept the Jullundur nomination 2 if it comes to you.
('68', 406, 1, 13, 764616) And I take it, you have taken over the college responsibility.
('68', 406, 1, 14, 764679) These things cannot be put away lightly.
('68', 406, 1, 15, 764720) You are right about Ku.
('68', 406, 1, 16, 764744) He is coming to Nandi Hill.
('68', 406, 1, 17, 764772) I shall see what is possible.
('68', 406, 1, 18, 764802) I shall not have the operation performed unless I am sure that it is necessary and the surgeon knows his work.
('68', 406, 1, 19, 764913) Bharatan too will be going probably to Kodaikanal.
('68', 406, 1, 20, 764964) Remember the date of my departure, 8th instant.
('68', 406, 1, 21, 765012) I leave Segaon on 8th morning.

('68', 406, 7, 27, 765167) Herewith Akarte's 4 letter.
('68', 406, 7, 28, 765195) It is difficult to make out what the truth is.
('68', 406, 7, 29, 765242) I find it necessary to exercise restraint in giving publicity to Buva.
('68', 406, 7, 30, 765313) It is all right to cultivate his acquaintance.
('68', 406, 7, 31, 765360) I consider it improper to make use of him for public service without closer experience of him.
('68', 406, 7, 32, 765455) I shall go deep into the matter when I get the time.

('68', 407, 2, 3, 765787) May 6, 1936
('68', 407, 3, 4, 765799) PREMA, You can write to me now.
('68', 407, 3, 5, 765831) We are leaving on the 8th for Nandi Durg.
('68', 407, 3, 6, 765873) You seem to have gathered good experience.
('68', 407, 3, 7, 765916) Merely because we doubt a man's sincerity we cannot reject his application if he is prepared to sign the Congress Pledge.
('68', 407, 3, 8, 766038) There will always be men who will wangle admission under one or the other pretext.
('68', 407, 3, 9, 766121) If the majority of the members are sincere, ultimately all will be well.
('68', 407, 3, 10, 766194) The report of the Maharashtrian's letter is perfectly correct.
('68', 407, 3, 11, 766257) 1 But his supposition was completely wrong.
('68', 407, 3, 12, 766301) The correspondent's letter could be interpreted to mean that by resting my hands on girls shoulders I used to gratify my sensual desire.
('68', 407, 3, 13, 766438) His words of course were different.
('68', 407, 3, 14, 766474) But the truth is that my discontinuing the practice of resting my hands on the shoulders of girls has nothing to do with my sensual desire.
('68', 407, 3, 15, 766614) It had its origin in my pampering the body with food while doing no work.
('68', 407, 3, 16, 766688) I had a discharge, but I was awake and the mind was under control.
('68', 407, 3, 17, 766755) I understood the cause and from that time stopped taking rest as prescribed by the doctors.
('68', 407, 3, 18, 766847) And my state now is better than it was, if such a state could be imagined.
('68', 407, 3, 19, 766922) If you wish to ask me more questions about this you may, for I have cherished high hopes of you.
('68', 407, 3, 20, 767019) You may, therefore, know from me anything concerning myself that you wish to.
('68', 407, 3, 21, 767097) The articles I have written recently deserve careful pondering over.
('68', 407, 3, 22, 767166) If you have understood them, the practice of brahmacharya will become very easy.
('68', 407, 3, 23, 767247) If one is convinced that the genital organs are not intended for sex gratification, wouldn't one's attitude change completely?
('68', 407, 3, 24, 767374) As a man happening to see on the road the blood stained sputum of a consumptive may take it to be a gem and long to pick it up, but will come to his senses as soon as he realizes his error, so is the case in regard to the function of the genital organs.
('68', 407, 3, 25, 767628) The truth is that this belief has never been held with sufficient conviction and clarity.
('68', 407, 4, 26, 767718) 1 A Maharashtrian professor from Poona had written to Gandhiji in connection with his article Nothing Without Grace ;vide Nothing Without Grace, 29 2 1936.

('68', 408, 1, 2, 767920) And now the new education denounces it, teaches that moderate sex gratification is a good thing and asserts its necessity.
('68', 408, 1, 3, 768043) Think over all this.
('68', 408, 1, 4, 768064) The experience of your friends that you have described is excellent.
('68', 408, 2, 5, 768133) Let this suffice for the present.

('68', 408, 4, 13, 768576) You shall follow the treatment unquestioningly.
('68', 408, 4, 14, 768624) The first thing is to get well.

('68', 408, 6, 18, 768784) PAUNAR, [May 6, 1936] 3
('68', 408, 7, 19, 768808) Gandhiji said he had sense enough not to spoil the effect of that rapturous utterance 4 by inflicting another speech on them.
('68', 408, 7, 20, 768934) But, he said, he would offer one test whereby he would like to measure their sincerity and earnestness next year.
('68', 408, 8, 21, 769048) 1 Two women of Sasvad, who though married and living with their husbands had observed abstinence for several years, had narrated their experiences to the addressee.
('68', 408, 8, 22, 769213) 2 Mahadev Desai in his Weekly Letter, from which this is extracted, explains that the yatra was an annual gathering of believers in khadi in Marathi speaking Central Provinces.
('68', 408, 8, 23, 769390) 3 Gandhiji visited Paunar on May 6, 1936. 4 Earlier, Vinoba Bhave had in a torrence of eloquence .
('68', 408, 8, 24, 769489) explained the object f khadi yatra and in doing so brought to bear all the wealth of imagery and illustration.
('68', 409, 0, 1, 769600) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 410
('68', 409, 1, 2, 769642) I should be satisfied if you were to follow the gospel of khadi with even a hundredth of Vinoba's faith.
('68', 409, 1, 3, 769747) We have to demonstrate to the poor that khadi could be had for the price of unginned raw cotton, that is to say, those who produce cotton can have khadi free.
('68', 409, 1, 4, 769906) That can happen only when we popularize the handginning of cotton, a process which preserves the vitality both of the cotton fibre and of the seed.
('68', 409, 1, 5, 770054) Jamnalalji would fain close his ginning factory tomorrow, if we were to ask him to do so.
('68', 409, 1, 6, 770144) But it would have no value.
('68', 409, 1, 7, 770172) If you were to take upon yourselves to gin all the cotton that you produce it would close down automatically.
('68', 409, 1, 8, 770282) Vinoba's simile of the lamp was very beautifully expressive indeed.
('68', 409, 1, 9, 770350) As darkness cannot stand in front of light, even so absence of khadi cannot exist in front of khadi.
('68', 409, 1, 10, 770451) Your khadi will be infectious only if you will bring to bear on it all the devotion and the perseverance and, above all, the intelligent devotion and perseverance that it deserves.
('68', 409, 1, 11, 770632) Only thereby will you be able to take it out of a narrow and exclusive groove and succeed in sharing it with those whom you come across.

('68', 410, 4, 7, 771392) Lilavati went to Bombay with Mahadev.
('68', 410, 4, 8, 771430) She may join you in Segaon during the last week of May or beginning of June.

('68', 410, 4, 12, 771682) I suggested [it] to him this morning.
('68', 410, 4, 13, 771720) The work you are just now doing is too much for you.
('68', 410, 4, 14, 771773) If however you do not like any of my appointments you will tell me.
('68', 410, 4, 15, 771841) I suggested Balwant Singh, as you were inclined to take Munnalal 1. And of Lilavati you had shown readiness to take her.
('68', 410, 4, 16, 771962) That was a different thing, I know.
('68', 410, 4, 17, 771998) But this is a proper occasion if she would come in advance.
('68', 410, 4, 18, 772058) I have my doubts as to her coming.
('68', 410, 4, 19, 772093) She simply wants my company.
('68', 410, 4, 20, 772122) But you will let me know your own wishes plainly and they will be given effect to.
('68', 410, 4, 21, 772205) The rammers should have gone to you this morning to be returned without fail on Sunday.

('68', 410, 10, 30, 772525) I entirely agree with you that if people had to be banished from the colony because of Rukmini's likes or dislikes, many more people than Amtul Salaam would have to leave.

('68', 411, 1, 3, 772850) But I know you do not want such peace.
('68', 411, 1, 4, 772889) To bear with Rukmini and yet not to yield to her 1 is your martyrdom.
('68', 411, 1, 5, 772959) But if A. has to leave for the sake of her health she must do so.
('68', 411, 1, 6, 773025) I now have a wire from Dr. Ansari that he has detained A. I now await his letter which he has promised.

('68', 411, 7, 14, 773337) What is all this?
('68', 411, 7, 15, 773355) What could a nice girl like Amtussalaam have done to you?
('68', 411, 7, 16, 773413) It is not good of you to harass a husband like Malkani.
('68', 411, 7, 17, 773469) Do you remember your promise to me?

('68', 411, 11, 22, 773656) May 7, 1936
('68', 411, 12, 23, 773668) DEAR DAUGHTER AMTUSSALAAM,
('68', 411, 13, 24, 773695) I wrote no letters to you earlier as I was expecting you.
('68', 411, 13, 25, 773753) Why need you go to a hill station when Doctor Saheb has said that it is not at all necessary?
('68', 411, 13, 26, 773847) You may well stay on.
('68', 411, 13, 27, 773869) Now I understand why Thakkar Bapa said that there was no work for you; it was solely to avoid unpleasantness.
('68', 411, 13, 28, 773979) Malkani frankly says that he needs you.
('68', 411, 13, 29, 774019) Hence you have now to stay on in the Harijan Colony.
('68', 411, 13, 30, 774072) There is no need at present to go to Dhaka 2 whatever might happen in future.
('68', 411, 13, 31, 774150) Anyway,

('68', 412, 1, 3, 774287) Now the problem of the Harijan girl is out of the way.
('68', 412, 1, 4, 774342) You should take no note of what .
('68', 412, 1, 5, 774376) 1 says; let her say whatever she likes; she is silly.
('68', 412, 1, 6, 774430) Anyway, I have written to her and I am writing to Bapa, too.

('68', 412, 8, 16, 774729) BHAI GHANSHYAMDAS,
('68', 412, 9, 17, 774748) Chandrashanker 3 is ill and Mahadev has gone to Poona; from there he will join me at Bangalore.
('68', 412, 9, 18, 774844) I leave this place tomorrow for Bangalore.
('68', 412, 9, 19, 774887) I shall be at Nandi Durg for a fortnight and then I go to Bangalore, for Vallabhbhai's sake.
('68', 412, 9, 20, 774980) Regarding Parameshwari 4 I have already obtained Parnerkar's 5
('68', 412, 10, 21, 775043) opinion and shall seek some more opinions.
('68', 412, 10, 22, 775086) The sanction of Rs. 10,000 from the Goseva Sangh to Parameshwari is being delayed.
('68', 412, 10, 23, 775169) A meeting will have to be called as three members have voted against it.
('68', 412, 10, 24, 775242) The meeting can be called only in June.
('68', 412, 10, 25, 775282) There will be a further hitch on account of Parnerkar's recent adverse opinion.
('68', 412, 10, 26, 775362) No doubt, he has experience behind him, having worked for years at Sabarmati.
('68', 412, 10, 27, 775440) At present he is working at Dhulia on behalf of the Goseva Sangh.
('68', 412, 10, 28, 775506) Dinkar 6 met me and I told him not to accept defeat but to go on trying to give you satisfaction.
('68', 412, 10, 29, 775604) I also told him that you certainly had some doubt about his application, none about his honesty or hard

('68', 413, 4, 7, 776236) 508. SPEECH AT A.I.V.I.A. MEETING 1
('68', 413, 5, 8, 776272) WARDHA, May 7, 1936
('68', 413, 6, 9, 776292) I take it that those who are members of the A. I. V. I. A. know the rules of the Association, one of which is that there is to be an annual general meeting.
('68', 413, 6, 10, 776449) Either such a meeting is necessary or it is not.
('68', 413, 6, 11, 776498) If it is, surely it is the duty of every member to attend the meeting unless he is unavoidably absent.
('68', 413, 6, 12, 776601) What I cannot understand is that the absentees have not all written to say what prevented them from attending the meeting.
('68', 413, 6, 13, 776724) The feeling on the part of an individual member that his absence alone cannot affect the quorum is obviously wrong.
('68', 413, 6, 14, 776840) Our ambition is to make at least one member for each of our 7,00,000 villages, but our actual membership is 517!
('68', 413, 6, 15, 776953) And the bulk of the members are not present!
('68', 413, 6, 16, 776998) It is deplorable, but it does not dismay me.
('68', 413, 6, 17, 777043) Let those who are present carry to the absentees at least this message that it was their duty to inform the Secretary as to the reason of their failure.
('68', 413, 6, 18, 777196) Failure even to intimate the reason argues lethargy, which certainly should disqualify one to be the member of an association like ours.
('68', 413, 7, 19, 777333) Mahatma Gandhi observed that the duty of the workers was to serve the villagers and if they found that the atmosphere in some place was not congenial to them for the pursuit of service owing to the hostility of local officials, nothing would be lost by their shifting their centres of work.
('68', 413, 7, 20, 777624) The country was wide enough to provide ample scope for work in places other than those in which conditions were
('68', 413, 8, 21, 777736) 1 The first annual general meeting of the Association scheduled to be held at 3 p.m.
('68', 413, 8, 22, 777821) had to be adjourned for want of quorum and was held at 8 p.m.
('68', 413, 8, 23, 777883) 2 This is extracted from Mahadev Desai's Weekly Letter.
('68', 413, 8, 24, 777939) The following paragraph is from The Bombay Chronicle.
('68', 414, 0, 1, 777993) VOL. 68 : 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 415
('68', 414, 1, 2, 778039) rendered difficult owing to extraneous forces.
('68', 414, 1, 3, 778086) Difficulties occasioned by internal forces it would be the duty of workers, however, to overcemo.
('68', 414, 2, 4, 778184) Some members talk of difficulties created from outside.
('68', 414, 2, 5, 778240) I think most of them are imaginary.
('68', 414, 2, 6, 778276) How much have we been able to do where there are no difficulties from outside?
('68', 414, 2, 7, 778355) Take Sindi and Segaon where Gajanan and Mirabehn have both been working with a zeal and rural mindedness that every one of us might envy.
('68', 414, 2, 8, 778493) How much have they achieved that could be shown?
('68', 414, 2, 9, 778542) The reason is the inertia, the lethargy of our people, the masters.
('68', 414, 2, 10, 778610) We want them to do something, i.e., to keep their surroundings clean, to eat wholesome food and to regulate their working hours so as to increase their income.
('68', 414, 2, 11, 778770) They have no faith in all this.
('68', 414, 2, 12, 778802) They have lost hope of bettering their lot.
('68', 414, 2, 13, 778846) We have to tackle the triple malady which holds our villages fast in its grip: (1) Want of corporate sanitation; (2) Deficient diet; (3) Inertia.
('68', 414, 2, 14, 778992) In Segaon where Mirabehn is working, all the outside circumstances are more favourable than anywhere else.
('68', 414, 2, 15, 779099) The zamindars there are Jamnalalji and Babasaheb Deshmukh.
('68', 414, 2, 16, 779158) They place no obstacles; they, on the contrary, help her.
('68', 414, 2, 17, 779216) And yet, do you think she gets much co operation from the people?
('68', 414, 2, 18, 779282) Not that they are wilfully obstructive.
('68', 414, 2, 19, 779322) They are not interested in their own welfare.
('68', 414, 2, 20, 779368) They don't appreciate modern sanitary methods.
('68', 414, 2, 21, 779415) They don't want to exert themselves beyond scratching their farms or doing such labour as they are used to.
('68', 414, 2, 22, 779523) These difficulties are real and serious.
('68', 414, 2, 23, 779564) But they must not baffle us.
('68', 414, 2, 24, 779593) We must have an unquenchable faith in our mission.
('68', 414, 2, 25, 779644) We must be patient with the people.
('68', 414, 2, 26, 779680) We are ourselves novices in village work.
('68', 414, 2, 27, 779722) We have to deal with a chronic disease.
('68', 414, 2, 28, 779762) Patience and perseverance, if we have them, overcome mountains of diffculties.
('68', 414, 2, 29, 779841) We are like nurses who may not leave their patients because they are reported to have an incurable disease.
('68', 414, 2, 30, 779949) The only way is to sit down in their midst and work away in steadfast faith, as their scavengers, their nurses, their servants, not as their patrons, and to forget all our prejudices are prepossessions.
('68', 414, 2, 31, 780152) Let us for a moment forget even swaraj, and certainly forget the haves whose presence oppresses us at every step.
('68', 414, 2, 32, 780266) They are there.
('68', 414, 2, 33, 780282) There are many who are dealing with these big problems.
('68', 414, 2, 34, 780338) Let us tackle the humbler work of the village which is necessary now and would be
('68', 415, 0, 1, 780420) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 416
('68', 415, 1, 2, 780462) even after we have reached our goal.
('68', 415, 1, 3, 780499) Indeed, the village work when it becomes successful will itself bring us nearer the goal.
('68', 415, 2, 4, 780589) He hoped to see Segaon become an ideal centre of persistent effort, and he trusted that worker's elsewhere would apply to the work before them the same zest and energy.
('68', 415, 2, 5, 780758) It was too early to judge the progress achieved, but he hoped that they would also attempt to understand thoroughly the implications of the threefold programme that had been placed before them by the Association.
('68', 415, 2, 6, 780971) The first part of this was the improvement of sanitary conditions, removal of filth and the eradication of habits which gave rise to uncleanliness.
('68', 415, 2, 7, 781119) That meant the education of the village population by personal example and steady work.
('68', 415, 3, 8, 781207) The next part of the programme called for a radical change in the dietary of the people so that they might be enabled to draw greater sustenance from the articles of food ordinarily available in villages.
('68', 415, 3, 9, 781412) This required that the processing of food stuffs should be done in the villages, as in the past, and that pure food stuffs should be made available in villages and not be drained away to towns.
('68', 415, 3, 10, 781606) The last portion of the programme was the utilization of spare time of the cultivators, the revival of dead or dying industries, and teaching all classes of people the right use of leisure.
('68', 415, 4, 11, 781796) All these were difficult tasks, Mahatma Gandhi admitted, and those friends of his were not wrong who warned him that he had now in the evening of his life taken upon his head a heavier responsibility than the promotion of the charkha movement or the removal of untouchability.
('68', 415, 4, 12, 782073) Both these activities, important as they were, formed only a part of the vast work of rural reconstruction.

('68', 415, 9, 20, 782423) Do keep yourself perfectly well and cheerful.

('68', 415, 10, 25, 782822) Even so, rains began before we had fully completed everything.

('68', 416, 12, 14, 783474) WARDHA, May 8, 1936
('68', 416, 13, 15, 783494) I may confess that I was sceptical about the opening of the school.
('68', 416, 13, 16, 783562) 1 We had not enough material, we had not much practical experience of village work, and I doubted whether we should be able to give the students anything helpful by way of training.
('68', 416, 13, 17, 783744) I also doubted whether many students would be forthcoming and whether they would be the kind of men we need for village work.
('68', 416, 13, 18, 783870) I am glad to say that my fears have been so far falsified, and that we have achieved during the brief three months more than was expected.
('68', 416, 13, 19, 784009) But today I propose to speak to you about the ideal of work and life that you have to keep in view and work towards.
('68', 416, 13, 20, 784126) You are here not for a career in the current sense of the term.
('68', 416, 14, 21, 784190) 1 The school was opened by the A.I.V.I.A at Maganwadi in January and had 37 students.
('68', 417, 0, 1, 784276) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 418
('68', 417, 1, 2, 784318) Today man's worth is measured in rupees, annas, pies and a man's educational training is an article of commerce.
('68', 417, 1, 3, 784431) If you have come with that measure in mind, you are doomed to disappointment.
('68', 417, 1, 4, 784509) At the end of your studies you may start with an honorarium of ten rupees and end with it.
('68', 417, 1, 5, 784600) You may not compare it with what a manager of a great firm or a high official gets.
('68', 417, 2, 6, 784684) You should cultivate the true spirit of humility and appreciate properly the role you are to play in the life of the rural community.
('68', 417, 2, 7, 784818) Your ambition should be to serve the villagers more intensively and not to look to higher emoluments.
('68', 417, 2, 8, 784920) You are not less valuable servants of India than members of the Indian Civil Service who draw a remuneration a hundred times higher than what you will get.
('68', 417, 2, 9, 785076) It is a topsy turvy economics which is fashioning your destiny today when persons draw salaries which are nearly a thousand to two thousand times the average income of an Indian.
('68', 417, 2, 10, 785255) We have to change the current standards.
('68', 417, 2, 11, 785296) We promise you no earthly careers, in fact we want to wean you from ambition of that kind.
('68', 417, 2, 12, 785387) You are expected to bring your food bill within Rs. 6 a month.
('68', 417, 2, 13, 785450) The food bill of an I.C.S. may come to Rs. 60 a month, but that does not mean that he is or will be on that account physically or intellectually or morally superior to you.
('68', 417, 2, 14, 785623) He may be for all his sumptuous living even inferior in all these respects.
('68', 417, 2, 15, 785699) You have come to this institution because, I presume, you do not value your qualifications in metal.
('68', 417, 2, 16, 785800) You delight in giving your service to the country for a mere pittance.
('68', 417, 2, 17, 785871) A man may earn thousands of rupees on the Stock Exchange but may be thoroughly useless for our purposes.
('68', 417, 2, 18, 785976) He would be unhappy in our humble surroundings and we should be unhappy in his.
('68', 417, 2, 19, 786056) We want ideal labourers in the country's cause.
('68', 417, 2, 20, 786104) They will not bother about what food they get, or what comforts they are assured by the villagers whom they serve.
('68', 417, 2, 21, 786219) They will trust to God for whatever they need, and will exult in the trials and tribulations they might have to undergo.
('68', 417, 2, 22, 786340) This is inevitable in our country where we have 7,00,000 villages to think of.
('68', 417, 2, 23, 786419) We cannot afford to have a salaried staff of workers who have an eye to regular increments, provident funds and pensions.
('68', 417, 2, 24, 786541) Faithful service of the villagers is its own satisfaction.
('68', 417, 2, 25, 786600) Some of you will be tempted to ask if this is also the standard
('68', 417, 3, 26, 786664) 1 This is reproduced from Mahadev Desai's Weekly Letter.
('68', 417, 3, 27, 786721) The following three paragraphs are from The Bombay Chronicle.
('68', 418, 0, 1, 786783) VOL. 68 : 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 419
('68', 418, 1, 2, 786829) for the villagers.
('68', 418, 1, 3, 786848) Not by any means.
('68', 418, 1, 4, 786866) These prospects are for us servants and not for the village folk our masters.
('68', 418, 1, 5, 786944) We have sat on their backs all these years, and we want to accept voluntary and increasing poverty in order that our masters' lot may be much better than it is today.
('68', 418, 1, 6, 787111) We have to enable them to earn much more than they are earning today.
('68', 418, 1, 7, 787181) That is the aim of the Village Industries Association.
('68', 418, 1, 8, 787236) It cannot prosper unless it has an ever increasing number of servants such as I have described.

('68', 418, 5, 13, 787589) Elsewhere the reader will find a deeply interesting letter 2 from an esteemed friend which was read to the delegates who recently assembled in Nagpur and who inaugurated the Akhil Bharatiya Sahitya Parishad.
('68', 418, 5, 14, 787797) There is a similar letter from another Muslim friend enclosing leading article 3 on the subject in The Bombay Chronicle dated 27th April last.
('68', 418, 5, 15, 787940) These letters and the Chronicle article generally represent my views on the question of common inter provincial speech.
('68', 418, 5, 16, 788060) However, I fear that there are perhaps limitations to my agreement which need to be publicly stated.
('68', 418, 5, 17, 788161) The limitations if they may be so called are designed to compass the very end that my friends have in view.
('68', 418, 5, 18, 788269) At the outset I must dismiss from consideration the suspicion entertained by some Muslims.
('68', 418, 5, 19, 788360) The whole atmosphere is surcharged with suspicion.
('68', 418, 5, 20, 788411) No person's declarations or acts are above suspicion.
('68', 418, 5, 21, 788465) The best way, in my opinion, for those who sincerely desire full communal unity and have themselves given no cause for suspicion is to act on the square without being swayed one way or the other by the passions of the moment, especially in matters like the Parishad which have nothing to do with the passions.
('68', 418, 5, 22, 788775) The object of the Parishad is to gather together all that is best in all the languages of India and to

('68', 419, 1, 2, 789110) make it available to the largest number of her inhabitants and therefore through a speech understood by the largest number.
('68', 419, 1, 3, 789234) Urdu is undoubtedly one of the many languages and contains treasures which should be the common property of all India.
('68', 419, 1, 4, 789353) No Indian who wishes to know the Muslim mind or to know all about Islam as it is being interpreted through the Indian medium can afford to ignore Urdu literature.
('68', 419, 1, 5, 789516) And the Parishad just established will fail in its duty and purpose if it does not unlock for all India the treasures to be found in the current Urdu literature.
('68', 419, 1, 6, 789678) My correspondent has made a mistake which needs to be cleared.
('68', 419, 1, 7, 789741) He could not have had before him the full test of Tandonji's speech 1 made not as the friend thinks at Banaras but at Allahabad, or he would not have made the serious mistake of thinking that when Tandonji talked of 22 crores speaking Hindi, he had in mind only those who wrote the modern artificial Hindi.
('68', 419, 1, 8, 790048) He made it clear that he referred to the vast mass of people of north of the Vindhya including the seven crores of Mussalmans who more or less spoke and understood the language which is evolved from Vrajabhasha and which has the latter's grammatical structure.
('68', 419, 1, 9, 790309) The name Hindi given to it is not original.
('68', 419, 1, 10, 790353) It was given by Muslim writers to what they wrote for the people of the North and what was undoubtedly like that which their Hindu brethren wrote.
('68', 419, 1, 11, 790500) Later on a bifurcation took place and Hindi written in Devanagari came to be the speech of the Hindus of the North and Urdu written in Arabic or Persian script came to be the speech of the Muslims of the North.
('68', 419, 1, 12, 790711) It is hardly true as yet to say that Urdu is common to the Mussalmans all over India.
('68', 419, 1, 13, 790797) I know that the Ali Brothers 2 and I found it difficult to make ourselves understood by the Moplahs of Malabar through our Urdu.
('68', 419, 1, 14, 790926) We had to have a Malayalee interpreter.
('68', 419, 1, 15, 790966) We found a similar diffiulty in East Bengal among its numerous Mussalmans.
('68', 419, 1, 16, 791041) Both Tandonji and Rajendra Babu 3 therefore meant the same thing absolutely as my friend when they used the word Hindi.
('68', 419, 1, 17, 791161) The use of the word Hindustani would not make their position clearer.
('68', 419, 1, 18, 791231) But the writer of the letter is on sure ground when he complains of the writers of the North who write a language which they call Hindi but which very few persons even of the North would

('68', 420, 1, 2, 791617) understand.
('68', 420, 1, 3, 791629) It is an effort which is doomed to fail like Johnsonian speech.
('68', 420, 1, 4, 791693) Then why insist on Hindi or Hindustani and why not simply say Hindustani, the writer may say.
('68', 420, 1, 5, 791787) For one simple reason that it would be impertinent for me, a newcomer, to ask an association 1 of 25 years' standing to alter its name when the need for it is not clearly proved.
('68', 420, 1, 6, 791966) The new Parishad is an offspring of the older Association and wants to cater both for the Muslims and Hindus of the North who speak the common mother tongue, it does not matter whether it is called Hindi or Hindustani.
('68', 420, 1, 7, 792185) For me either word has the same connotation.
('68', 420, 1, 8, 792230) But I would not quarrel with those who would use the word Hindi if they mean the same speech as I do.
('68', 420, 1, 9, 792332) I do not understand the writer's objection to the adoption of the expression Akhil Bharatiya.
('68', 420, 1, 10, 792426) It is an expression certainly known to the Hindus all over India.
('68', 420, 1, 11, 792492) And I make bold to say that even the majority of the Mussalmans of the North would understand it.
('68', 420, 1, 12, 792590) The Indian culture of our times is in the making.
('68', 420, 1, 13, 792640) Many of us are striving to produce a blend of all the cultures which seem today to be in clash with one another.
('68', 420, 1, 14, 792753) No culture can live if it attempts to be exclusive.
('68', 420, 1, 15, 792805) There is no such thing as pure Aryan culture in existence today in India.
('68', 420, 1, 16, 792879) Whether the Aryans were indigenous to India or were unwelcome intruders, does not interest me much.
('68', 420, 1, 17, 792979) What does interest me is the fact that my remote ancestors blended with one another with the utmost freedom and we of the present generation are a result of that blend.
('68', 420, 1, 18, 793148) Whether we are doing any good to the country of our birth and the tiny globe which sustains us or whether we are a burden, the future alone will show.
('68', 420, 1, 19, 793299) So far as I am concerned the new Parishad and the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan have the common good of all through a blending of the best in all Indias languages.
('68', 420, 1, 20, 793456) If they have not, they will perish.
('68', 420, 1, 21, 793492) But blending to be that must not mean exclusion of everything that has an Aryan flavour any more than that of everything that has an Arabian or for that matter English or any other flavour.
('68', 420, 1, 22, 793682) I may not prolong the argument this week.
('68', 420, 1, 23, 793724) There are still some important points to be covered.

('68', 421, 3, 4, 793978) MY DEAR SLAVE TO BE,
('68', 421, 4, 5, 793999) This is being written on the train nearing Madras.
('68', 421, 4, 6, 794050) We were in a crowded train at Wardha and were divided into three parties.
('68', 421, 4, 7, 794124) Towards 10 oclock we all had sleeping room quite comfortable.
('68', 421, 4, 8, 794186) I wished you were with us.
('68', 421, 4, 9, 794213) Except for the heat you would have enjoyed the journey.
('68', 421, 4, 10, 794269) On way I have already collected Rs. 186 for the Harijan cause.
('68', 421, 4, 11, 794332) I hope to make up Rs. 200 before reaching Madras.
('68', 421, 4, 12, 794382) I shall cease to be tyrant when you become a willing slave instead of a reble for nothingan imaginary rebel to an imaginary tyrant.
('68', 421, 4, 13, 794514) Whether your idiocy will permit you to see such an obvious thing is another question.
('68', 421, 4, 14, 794600) I shall wait, watch and see.
('68', 421, 4, 15, 794629) I hope the parcel contains much you wanted.
('68', 421, 4, 16, 794673) What about the bigger one for Ala?
('68', 421, 4, 17, 794708) I cant understand why you have not got the lace.
('68', 421, 4, 18, 794757) I must inquire.
('68', 421, 4, 19, 794773) and Shanta 1 will follow me in a day or two.
('68', 421, 4, 20, 794818) I have asked Ku.
('68', 421, 4, 21, 794835) to stop in Bombay a day or two longer, in order to have a thorough examination.
('68', 421, 4, 22, 794915) I hope you were a match for your opponents in the matter of birth control argument.
('68', 421, 4, 23, 794999) Non violence is not an easy job.
('68', 421, 4, 24, 795032) It is the subtlest force in the world.
('68', 421, 4, 25, 795071) It easily eludes one.
('68', 421, 4, 26, 795093) But I know that in the matter of non violence you may be beaten in argument; you wont be dislodged from your conviction which had come to you before your reason had approved of it.

('68', 422, 3, 4, 795544) DEAR SISTER,
('68', 422, 4, 5, 795557) It was very good that you went to Trivandrum.
('68', 422, 4, 6, 795603) 1 I gave you the trouble of travelling such a long distance only because of the importance of the work.
('68', 422, 4, 7, 795707) I am sure much benefit has resulted from your visit.
('68', 422, 4, 8, 795760) I am writing this on the train.

('68', 422, 10, 18, 796246) Declining to comment on Indian or world politics, Gandhiji told an Associated Press representative: Talk to me about the weather, but politicsno.
('68', 422, 10, 19, 796392) Having with drawn from politics now, it will not be proper for me to talk about politics or politicians.
('68', 422, 11, 20, 796497) The Mahatma likewise declined to comment on the Abyssinian question, but read with interest Pandit Jawaharlals rejoinder to the Italian Consul General.
('68', 422, 12, 21, 796649) In reply to an enquiry about his health, the Mahatma said that he was now feeling very much better.
('68', 422, 12, 22, 796749) The trip was not unpleasant.
('68', 422, 12, 23, 796778) He had been travelling along the coast with a sea breeze blowing.

('68', 423, 2, 4, 797274) It may be that this time I may have to act as jailor to him (Mr. Vallabhbhai) because it is for his recuperation rather than mine that I am going to Nandi Hills.

('68', 423, 5, 7, 797497) [On or after May 10, 1936] 2
('68', 423, 6, 8, 797526) He has discovered, said Sir Chandrashekharan, introducing Dr. Rahm, an insect that can live without food and water for 12 years, and has come to India for further researches in biology.
('68', 423, 7, 9, 797712) [GANDHIJI:] When you discover the secret at the back of it, please pass it on to me.
('68', 423, 8, 10, 797797) RAHM:] But I am a scientist and a monk also, and when I decided to come to pay my respects to you, I thought of asking you a question or two.
('68', 423, 8, 11, 797939) May I do so?
('68', 423, 8, 12, 797952) With pleasure.
('68', 423, 9, 13, 797967) Dr. Rahm was perplexed by the many warring creeds in the world and wondered if there was no way of ending the conflict.
('68', 423, 9, 14, 798087) It depends on Christians.
('68', 423, 9, 15, 798113) If only they would make up their minds to unite with the others !
('68', 423, 9, 16, 798179) But they will not do so.
('68', 423, 9, 17, 798204) Their solution is universal acceptance of Christianity as they believe it.
('68', 423, 9, 18, 798279) An English friend has been at me for the past thirty years trying to persuade me that there is nothing but damnation in Hinduism and that I must accept Christianity.
('68', 423, 9, 19, 798445) When I was in jail I got, from separate sources, no less than three copies of the Life of Sister Therese, in the hope that I should follow her example and accept Jesus as the only begotten Son of God and my Saviour.
('68', 423, 9, 20, 798661) I read the book prayerfully but I could not accept even St. Thereses testimony for myself.
('68', 423, 9, 21, 798752) I must say I have an open mind, if indeed at this stage and age of my life I can be said to
('68', 423, 10, 22, 798844) 1 Introducing the interview, Mahadev Desai writes in his Weekly Letter : Sir Chandrashekharan Venkata Raman came up the hill one afternoon with Professor Rahm from Switzerland, a reputed biologist. 2 Gandhiji reached Nandi Hills on May 10, 1936.

('68', 424, 1, 2, 799136) have an open mind on this question.
('68', 424, 1, 3, 799172) Anyway I claim to have an open mind in this sense that if things were to happen to me as they did to Saul before he became Paul, I should not hesitate to be converted.
('68', 424, 1, 4, 799340) But today I rebel against orthodox Christianity, as I am convinced that it has distorted the message of Jesus.
('68', 424, 1, 5, 799451) He was an Asiatic whose message was delivered through many media and when it had the backing of a Roman emperor it became an imperialist faith as it remains to this day.
('68', 424, 1, 6, 799621) Of course there are noble but rare exceptions like Andrews and Elwin.
('68', 424, 1, 7, 799691) 1 But the general trend is as I have indicated.
('68', 424, 1, 8, 799739) There was held the other day in Bombay a parliament of religions.
('68', 424, 1, 9, 799805) Now a positive bar to a real parliament of religions is the refusal to accept an equal basis and a mutual regard for one anothers faith.
('68', 424, 1, 10, 799942) We must not forget that it is a parliament of religions, and not of a few religious minded men.
('68', 424, 1, 11, 800038) Did Christianity enter the parliament on a par with the others?
('68', 424, 1, 12, 800102) When they do not do so openly, they secretly criticize us for our having many gods, forgetting that they have also many gods.
('68', 424, 1, 13, 800228) Dr. Rahm was not perhaps perpared for this reply.
('68', 424, 1, 14, 800278) He made no answer.
('68', 424, 1, 15, 800297) He put another question in reply: If we cannot unite, cant we fight atheism which seems to be so much on the increase?
('68', 424, 2, 16, 800416) C.V. Raman put in: I shall answer your question.
('68', 424, 2, 17, 800465) If there is a God we must look for Him in the universe.
('68', 424, 2, 18, 800521) If He is not there, He is not worth looking for.
('68', 424, 2, 19, 800570) I am being looked upon in various quarters as an atheist, but I am not.
('68', 424, 2, 20, 800642) The growing discoveries in the science of astronomy and physics seem to me to be further and further revelations of God.
('68', 424, 2, 21, 800763) Mahatmaji, religions cannot unite.
('68', 424, 2, 22, 800798) Science offers the best opportunity for a complete fellowship.
('68', 424, 2, 23, 800861) All men of science are brothers. What about the converse?
('68', 424, 2, 24, 800919) All who are not men of science are not brothers?
('68', 424, 3, 25, 800968) The distinguished physicist saw the joke and said: But all can become men of science. You will have to present a kalma 2 of science as Islam presents one.
('68', 424, 4, 26, 801123) Science, said Sir C.V. Raman, is nothing but a search for truthtruth not only in the physical world, but in the world of logic, psychology, behaviour and so on.
('68', 424, 4, 27, 801284) The virtue of a truly scientific frame of mind is the readiness to reject what is false and untrue.
('68', 424, 4, 28, 801384) It proclaims from the house tops that there is no virtue in sticking to untruth.

('68', 425, 12, 27, 802801) I sent a wire to Begum Sahiba and a message to the Press.
('68', 425, 12, 28, 802859) I have written, too, to Zohra.
('68', 425, 12, 29, 802890) I expect from you a full account.

('68', 425, 13, 32, 803083) announcing the terrible news of Dr. Ansaris sudden death.
('68', 425, 13, 33, 803141) Gandhiji immediately issued the following Press message. Dr. M.A. Ansari died on the train while going from Dehradun to Delhi on May 10. 2 Principal, Jamia Millia Islamia, Delhi

('68', 426, 1, 3, 803417) Few deaths leave me disconsolate as this has done.
('68', 426, 1, 4, 803468) Quite wrongly, I know, but I had pictured Dr. Ansari as one destined to finish his century.
('68', 426, 1, 5, 803560) When, therefore, I got the Press wire,I would not believe [it] at first.
('68', 426, 1, 6, 803633) He had become part of the lives of many.
('68', 426, 1, 7, 803674) But God is great.
('68', 426, 1, 8, 803692) He gives and takes away.
('68', 426, 1, 9, 803717) We never know His purpose.
('68', 426, 1, 10, 803744) We dare not quarrel with His dispositions.
('68', 426, 1, 11, 803787) Let us hope and believe that good will come out of this good friends death, as nothing but good came out of his life.
('68', 426, 1, 12, 803905) I know what this death means to the Jamia.

('68', 426, 4, 17, 804103) MY DEAR IDIOT,
('68', 426, 5, 18, 804118) I have just got your letter.
('68', 426, 5, 19, 804147) We reached here yesterday safe and sound.
('68', 426, 5, 20, 804189) It was Sunday and so though I thought of you, I dismissed the talk of a wire.
('68', 426, 5, 21, 804267) Those who try to approach the villagers have to forget that there is such a thing as telegrams.
('68', 426, 5, 22, 804363) A weekly post is all they have and often not even that.
('68', 426, 5, 23, 804419) In Segaon there is supposed to be a weekly delivery but I am told the postman in Wardha hands the letters to any Segaon man whom he comes across and whom he trusts !!!
('68', 426, 5, 24, 804587) Your letters are all torn [up] after I have read and answered them.
('68', 426, 5, 25, 804655) I hope you got my letter 1 written on the train in pencil hand.
('68', 426, 5, 26, 804719) It was posted at Madras.
('68', 426, 5, 27, 804744) I walked up the hill from the base.
('68', 426, 5, 28, 804780) It took me 21 2 hours, the distance covered was over 5 miles.
('68', 426, 5, 29, 804842) I walked very slow.
('68', 426, 5, 30, 804862) Hence there was no fatigue.
('68', 426, 5, 31, 804890) It was Dr. Ansari who wanted the Sardar to pass the summer on a hill.
('68', 426, 5, 32, 804960) And he himself is no more.
('68', 426, 5, 33, 804987) Evidently his death was quite sudden.
('68', 426, 5, 34, 805025) For me it is a very personal loss.
('68', 426, 5, 35, 805060) I relied upon his advice in so many matters.
('68', 426, 5, 36, 805105) The pressure put upon you not to resist your nomination to the Jullunder Municipality, I quite understand.
('68', 426, 5, 37, 805212) Idiots being honest people and therefore impartial, are always in demand.

('68', 427, 1, 5, 805556) Why dont you move the Municipal Committee?
('68', 427, 1, 6, 805599) Of course, what is true of Segaon and Sindi must be true of the black town of Simla.
('68', 427, 1, 7, 805684) I suppose you know that the old Indian part of Madras is to this day called black town.
('68', 427, 1, 8, 805772) It has not occurred to any of the city fathers to change that name, though they give patriotic names to some of their streets.
('68', 427, 1, 9, 805899) We cannot all of a sudden develop sanitary habits because we heave up to Simla heights.
('68', 427, 1, 10, 805987) But the M. Committee can, if it will, enforce proper sanitation.
('68', 427, 1, 11, 806052) Many things are enforced over there.
('68', 427, 1, 12, 806089) Sanitary enforcement will be least open to objection.
('68', 427, 1, 13, 806143) Well, Nandi Hill is really a model of sanitation, of course enforced from above.
('68', 427, 1, 14, 806224) The air is beautiful.

('68', 427, 8, 28, 806671) The reason why I sent you my reply 2 to Agatha was to know whether I had correctly represented your attitude.

('68', 428, 1, 3, 807317) If so, you should give me concrete instances.
('68', 428, 1, 4, 807363) I have already admitted that my method of dealing with things is different from yours as I see it.
('68', 428, 1, 5, 807462) But there is no difference whatsoever about looking at the existing system.
('68', 428, 1, 6, 807538) Dr. Ansaris death is a severe blow.
('68', 428, 1, 7, 807574) For me it was infinitely more than a political friendship.

('68', 429, 1, 3, 808511) I would like to possess a copy of them if it is available So far as khadi exhibits in a swadeshi exhibition which admits mill cloth are concerned, it is a ticklish question.

('68', 429, 1, 5, 808760) If khadi is not exhibited in such exhibitions there are sound business reasons for the absence.

('68', 431, 7, 34, 812304) Otherwise I would not have allowed you to return the ticket.
('68', 431, 7, 35, 812365) But your saying that I heard you out the last time out of kindness is the limit of unbelief.
('68', 431, 7, 36, 812458) Such lack of faith in the very person whom you revere!
('68', 431, 7, 37, 812513) If I had not wanted to hear you out could I not have said so?
('68', 431, 7, 38, 812575) I listened to your tale about your uncle with such interest that even today I can repeat it almost in your very words.
('68', 431, 7, 39, 812694) I did not have the time, otherwise I would have gone on listening to you for

('68', 432, 1, 2, 812817) even longer than an hour.
('68', 432, 1, 3, 812843) I was absolutely certain that you would walk with me if only to finish your tale.
('68', 432, 1, 4, 812925) What led you to believe that I was merely being tolerant and did not really wish to hear you out?
('68', 432, 1, 5, 813023) Why did you not ask me the moment you had such a doubt?
('68', 432, 1, 6, 813079) Why this lack of faith?
('68', 432, 1, 7, 813103) But it is no good crying over spilt milk.
('68', 432, 1, 8, 813145) What has happened has happened.
('68', 432, 1, 9, 813177) From this incident too learn if you can a lesson in faith.
('68', 432, 1, 10, 813236) Even now you are free to come if you want.
('68', 432, 1, 11, 813279) Only remember this much, that if you come now, come in good faith.
('68', 432, 1, 12, 813346) What good will it do if you come with a doubtful mind?

('68', 432, 7, 20, 813616) It is quite like you to be laid up.
('68', 432, 7, 21, 813652) How I wish I could exercise the authority of a tyrant to drag you down to this beauty spot.
('68', 432, 7, 22, 813744) No worry, no noises, not a particle of dust, perfect quiet, subdued foliage and refreshing coolness, no social functions, nice tennis ground, beautiful walks.
('68', 432, 7, 23, 813903) But what can a poor tyrant do to an idiot rebel?
('68', 432, 7, 24, 813952) Therefore you will suffer and eat the dust of Simla rather than breathe the dustless fresh air of Nandi.
('68', 432, 7, 25, 814057) I hope to have better news in your next letter.
('68', 432, 7, 26, 814105) Dont you go near those dirty places in this state of your health.

('68', 434, 4, 6, 816134) Of course you are right in not coming to me.

('68', 435, 4, 5, 817013) I send with this a cheque for Rs. 200 received from Sophia Wadia 1. The receipt need not be sent to her.
('68', 435, 4, 6, 817118) Send it to me.
('68', 435, 4, 7, 817133) I understand what you say regarding Sastri.
('68', 435, 4, 8, 817177) I enclose [a report of] the work done in Madras in four hours.
('68', 435, 4, 9, 817240) Jagannathdas had arranged a prayer meeting in Kodambakkam, but I refused to go till an assurance was given that the institution would be continued.
('68', 435, 4, 10, 817388) Jagannathdas gave the required assurance, which I send with this.
('68', 435, 4, 11, 817454) Please preserve it.
('68', 435, 4, 12, 817474) I met Pratapmalji also.
('68', 435, 4, 13, 817498) He, too, has undertaken to solve the financial worries, but he asked for somebody who would be able to create there the atmosphere that we have in the Ashram.
('68', 435, 4, 14, 817657) How can I find such a person?
('68', 435, 4, 15, 817687) I met Venkatasubbiah here and discussed the problem with him.
('68', 435, 4, 16, 817749) He and the others expressed their dislike of Sastri.
('68', 435, 4, 17, 817802) Venkatasubbiah says, however, that they will do without Sastri and Ganesan.
('68', 435, 4, 18, 817878) One of the four will visit the place daily by turns.
('68', 435, 4, 19, 817931) This is what I have been able to do.
('68', 435, 4, 20, 817968) Kindly write from there now and ask them clearly to relieve Ganesan.
('68', 435, 4, 21, 818037) Sastris resignation has already been accepted.
('68', 435, 4, 22, 818084) You can mention Jagannathdass letter and say that you hope that the four of them will carry on the work.
('68', 435, 4, 23, 818189) Since Dr. Ansari had detained Amtussalaam please accommodate her.
('68', 435, 4, 24, 818255) Malkani, poor man, writes and tells me that he could not tolerate the thought that she had to leave because of Rukmini.
('68', 435, 4, 25, 818375) The latter does not tolerate anybody.
('68', 435, 4, 26, 818413) But does that mean that they should all leave?
('68', 435, 4, 27, 818460) I have written a strong letter 2 to her.
('68', 435, 4, 28, 818501) Amtussalaam is not likely to pay attention to Rukminis words.
('68', 435, 4, 29, 818563) She will remain happy if you go on giving her some work.
('68', 435, 4, 30, 818620) I hope that your letters are opened before they are sent to you.
('68', 435, 4, 31, 818685) If there is any cheque or such things in an envelope, they should not follow you from place to place.
('68', 435, 4, 32, 818787) You, too, have been travelling a good deal.
('68', 435, 4, 33, 818831) It seems you are becoming young again.

('68', 438, 4, 9, 822729) Neem leaves ought not to be shunned simply on account of their bitter taste; their efficacy is well known.
('68', 438, 4, 10, 822836) Similarly, some qualities of tamarind also are universally acknowledged.
('68', 438, 4, 11, 822909) However, there is no such rule that one or the other thing must prove beneficial to everyone.
('68', 438, 4, 12, 823003) There is no reason, either, to believe that milk no more agrees with you because of the quinine.
('68', 438, 4, 13, 823100) The rule about forgoing the morning meal [on the day] of the does not apply to those who do not take the evening meal.
('68', 438, 4, 14, 823219) But you may discontinue the morning meal if it does not suit you.
('68', 438, 4, 15, 823285) Nor do you need to make it a rule to have a weekly fast.
('68', 438, 4, 16, 823342) In case of a feeling like indigestion you should of course abstain from food.
('68', 438, 4, 17, 823420) It is good that the pain in your spine has disappeared.
('68', 438, 4, 18, 823476) Yes, I do intend to settle in Segaon.

('68', 439, 6, 9, 824142) May 15,1936 CHI.
('68', 439, 6, 10, 824159) MARY, I have just had a wire saying that Tara died at Hrishikesh.
('68', 439, 6, 11, 824225) The news is stunning, unbelievable.
('68', 439, 6, 12, 824261) I have no further particulars.
('68', 439, 6, 13, 824292) I had warned her against braving the pilgrimage.
('68', 439, 6, 14, 824341) But she had an iron will.
('68', 439, 6, 15, 824367) Once it was made up it was immovable.
('68', 439, 6, 16, 824405) I have wired for particulars.
('68', 439, 6, 17, 824435) Perhpas you have them already.
('68', 439, 6, 18, 824466) Her forgiving nature and charity had captivated me.
('68', 439, 6, 19, 824518) Her belief in the goodness of human nature was beyond all praise.
('68', 439, 6, 20, 824584) She has sacrificed herself for the cause she believed in.
('68', 439, 6, 21, 824642) Shanta is here and she has given Miss Blythes address.
('68', 439, 6, 22, 824697) Miss B. was her partner.
('68', 439, 6, 23, 824722) You will tell me all you know and I ought to know about Tara.
('68', 439, 6, 24, 824784) I got your letter yesterday.
('68', 439, 6, 25, 824813) All these days I had taken you at your word and never wrote to you.
('68', 439, 6, 26, 824881) I am looking forward to Miss Maddens letter.
('68', 439, 6, 27, 824926) I am glad she will be with you for one year.
('68', 439, 6, 28, 824971) Tara wanted me to invite her to see me again.
('68', 439, 6, 29, 825017) There was no question of doing so immediately as I was coming to Nandi.
('68', 439, 6, 30, 825089) But I think the present arrangement is better.
('68', 439, 6, 31, 825136) Only, she must go slow in making changes in her life.
('68', 439, 6, 32, 825190) Europeans simply cannot make some changes.
('68', 439, 6, 33, 825233) Each one has to recognize his limitations.
('68', 439, 6, 34, 825276) Of course you can spend for the roof and the like what you might have saved from your expenses.
('68', 439, 6, 35, 825372) You will take a lesson form Taras life and not overdo things.

('68', 440, 6, 29, 826666) Cholera cases need organized treatment.
('68', 440, 6, 30, 826706) But I suppose nothing of the kind is yet possible in our country.
('68', 440, 6, 31, 826772) There is not that corporate sense of responsibility.
('68', 440, 6, 32, 826825) The few of us who have must persevere before a visible impression is made.
('68', 440, 6, 33, 826900) Do you suggest anything to make the exhibition less expensive, and more instructive?
('68', 440, 6, 34, 826985) This one 3 was instructive enough as far as it went.
('68', 440, 6, 35, 827038) It was not inexpensive.
('68', 440, 6, 36, 827062) Later on it drew huge crowds and there will be practically no loss, if at all.
('68', 440, 6, 37, 827141) We had Rs. 25, 000 entrance fees and Rs. 5, 000 from stalls.
('68', 440, 6, 38, 827202) Khadi sold very well and so did many other things.

('68', 441, 7, 15, 828105) I understand what you say about Sumitra.
('68', 441, 7, 16, 828146) Sardar told us about Vanamalas adventure.
('68', 441, 7, 17, 828188) I am now trying to free Sumitra from the botheration.
('68', 441, 7, 18, 828242) You were quite right in sending her.
('68', 441, 7, 19, 828279) Ramdas has by now realized that Sumitra only harms herself by going to her mother.
('68', 441, 7, 20, 828362) I am sending herewith the letter which reports that a sum of Rs. .

('68', 442, 3, 4, 828924) SPINNERS WELFARE 1
('68', 442, 4, 5, 828943) A few points why Khadi Pratishthan, devoted to the khadi work in Bengal, should
('68', 442, 5, 6, 829023) continue to give work (in a graduated higher scale of wages) to spinners and find sale for their products in conjunction with self spinning work:
('68', 442, 6, 7, 829169) 1. Khadi is never meant to enter into competition with machine (i.e., mill ) made
('68', 442, 8, 8, 829251) 2. Khadi represents back to village cry.
('68', 442, 9, 9, 829292) 3. Village life means simplicity and freedom from contamination of urban
('68', 442, 10, 10, 829365) civilized and refined mode of life, i.e., life represented by cinemas, race gambling and other nonsensical things.
('68', 442, 11, 11, 829480) 4. In the mills the workmen get higher wages, but they are converted into so many
('68', 442, 12, 12, 829562) automata and drudges in the mill area.
('68', 442, 12, 13, 829601) Half their wages again are consumed in drink and prostitution.
('68', 442, 13, 14, 829664) 5. The poor women (generally widows) who ply the charkha and earn a bare
('68', 442, 14, 15, 829737) pittance are thereby enabled to be self supporting and not dependent on their male
('68', 442, 15, 16, 829820) relatives who really sit idle and make the helpless women dependent on them work like drudges and galley slaves.
('68', 442, 15, 17, 829933) Thus the latter are really freed from sweated labour.
('68', 442, 16, 18, 829987) 6. Those who ply the charkha are seldom or never whole time workers; only
('68', 442, 17, 19, 830061) during the intervals of household duties they utilize their leisure hours.
('68', 442, 17, 20, 830136) So it would be wrong to compare their off time labour with that of the sweated labour of the mills.
('68', 442, 18, 21, 830236) 7. In Bengal there is only one crop (the Aman Paddy) in most parts.
('68', 442, 18, 22, 830304) That gives
('68', 442, 19, 23, 830315) peasants occupation for barely three months in the year.
('68', 442, 19, 24, 830372) Even where there is second crop which gives employment for a couple of extra months or so, for seven months they sit idle.
('68', 442, 19, 25, 830495) Hence, if the people could be persuaded to ply the charkha, they would have a second occupation or another string to the bow.
('68', 442, 19, 26, 830621) Thus during a failure of crop due to drought or flood (as is often the case in Bengal at any rate) plying the charkha would be a God send.
('68', 442, 19, 27, 830760) The people wont starve or be dependent on chance doles distributed in the relief centres.
('68', 442, 20, 28, 830850) 8. The spinners are not the only people benefited; along with the spinners a large
('68', 442, 21, 29, 830933) body of weavers find occupation; in fact, on week days (especially during the hat or village market days) the weavers in the khadi centres with their woven dhotis and

('68', 443, 2, 4, 831328) 9. A unique experiment is going on in the Atral and Talora centres (visited by you
('68', 443, 3, 5, 831411) in 1925).
('68', 443, 3, 6, 831421) After 12 years of hard labour, expenses, not to speak of the sacrifices of voluntary workers, at last we have got a body of willing self spinners.

('68', 443, 7, 11, 831763) A.I.S.A. RESOLUTION 1
('68', 443, 8, 12, 831785) [On or before October 11, 1935]
('68', 443, 9, 13, 831817) 1. This Council is of opinion that the wages now paid for spinning are inadequate,
('68', 443, 10, 14, 831900) and therefore resolves that they be raised and a suitable standard be fixed so that spinners may at least receive a minimum wage calculated on the basis of eight hours efficient work, sufficient at least to procure clothing (20 yards per year) and maintenance in accordance with a scientifically prescribed scale of minimum food requirements.
('68', 443, 10, 15, 832243) All concerned should try, as circumstances permit, for a progressive rise in the wages scale, so as to reach a standard enabling each spinning family to be properly maintained out of earning of its working members.
('68', 443, 11, 16, 832458) 2. In order to guide the A.I.S.A. workers in the execution of the principle
('68', 443, 12, 17, 832534) underlying the foregoing proposition, the following should be regarded by all branches and bodies, working in affiliation to or in any other way under the Association, as the settled policy of the Association until it is altered in the light of further experience by the Council:
('68', 443, 13, 18, 832814) (a) The mission of the Association is to make every home in India selfsufficing
('68', 443, 14, 19, 832894) through khadi with reference to its clothing requirements, and to promote the welfare of spinners who are the least paid among khadi artisans and all others engaged in the different cotton processes beginning with growing cotton and ending with weaving of khadi.
('68', 443, 15, 20, 833157) (b) It is therefore imperative that those who work for the production of khadi,
('68', 443, 16, 21, 833237) whether as artisans, sellers or otherwise, shall use khadi for their clothing requirements to the exclusion of every other kind of cloth.

('68', 444, 0, 1, 833460) VOL. 68 : 23 SEPTEMBER, 1935 15 MAY, 1936 445
('68', 444, 1, 2, 833506) (c) All the branches and affiliated bodies shall so work the scheme as to avoid all
('68', 444, 2, 3, 833590) losses, that is, so as to restrict their production to the demand within their own selected
('68', 444, 3, 4, 833682) areas commencing with their immediate neighbourhood and never extending beyond their
('68', 444, 4, 5, 833767) province except in so far as they are called upon by other provinces to meet the latter's
('68', 444, 5, 6, 833857) demand.
('68', 444, 6, 7, 833865) (d) In order to avoid surplus production, producers may restrict their operations
('68', 444, 7, 8, 833947) only to those spinners who solely depend upon spinning for their daily bread for part of
('68', 444, 8, 9, 834036) the year or the whole of it.
('68', 444, 8, 10, 834065) Branches and other bodies shall maintain an accurate register
('68', 444, 9, 11, 834127) of all the spinners and other artisans employed by them and shall deal directly with them.
('68', 444, 10, 12, 834218) In order to ensure the use of the wages for clothing and food, a part or the whole of them
('68', 444, 11, 13, 834309) may be paid in kind, i.e., khadi or other necessaries of life.
('68', 444, 12, 14, 834372) (e) In order to avoid overlapping, undue competition, or duplicating of expenses
('68', 444, 13, 15, 834453) where there are more khadi producing organizations than one, the area of operation of
('68', 444, 14, 16, 834539) each shall be previously defined.
('68', 444, 14, 17, 834573) Private certified producers will not be encouraged by
('68', 444, 15, 18, 834627) the Association.
('68', 444, 15, 19, 834644) Among those that are already certified, those only who will work strictly

('68', 445, 2, 3, 835589) FOR HINDUSTANI ONLY 1
('68', 445, 3, 4, 835611) That the Hindi Urdu question is in imminent danger of becoming a communal
('68', 445, 4, 5, 835685) issue is evident from the speech Mr. Purshottamdas Tandon delivered at the opening caremony of the Hindi Museum at Benares in the first week of this month.
('68', 445, 4, 6, 835841) He declared that next to Chinese, Hindi was the most widely spoken language in Asia.
('68', 445, 4, 7, 835926) This means, in other words, that the problem of a common language is solved; it is going to be Hindi, because Hindi is spoken by the majority of Indians.
('68', 445, 4, 8, 836080) Those who clamour for Hindustani can be outnumbered, therefore they cannot matter.
('68', 445, 4, 9, 836163) But the counting of heads is no more a remedy than breaking of heads.
('68', 445, 4, 10, 836233) Whatever Mr. Tandon may have really meant, it seems to me that ground is being prepared for another such indignity as the Communal Award.
('68', 445, 5, 11, 836371) It is only your prestige and the confidence inspired by your personality that can
('68', 445, 6, 12, 836453) rescue us.
('68', 445, 6, 13, 836464) I am giving below a number of points which in my humble opinion are rational in themselves and provide a sound basis for a common language.
('68', 445, 6, 14, 836604) If you consider them and find them worthy, not in your own estimation only but also of the cause they are meant to serve, you may make them known to others.
('68', 445, 6, 15, 836761) What I am dreaming of just now is that they might become the basis of a public pronouncement by you.
('68', 445, 7, 16, 836862) The points are:
('68', 445, 8, 17, 836878) 1. That our common language shall be called Hindustani, not Hindi.
('68', 445, 9, 18, 836945) 2. That Hindustani shall not be considered to have any peculiar association with
('68', 445, 10, 19, 837026) the religious traditions of any community.
('68', 445, 11, 20, 837069) 3. That the test of foreign and indigenous shall not be applied to any word, but
('68', 445, 12, 21, 837150) only the test of currency.
('68', 445, 13, 22, 837177) 4. That all words used by Hindu writers of Urdu and Muslim writers of Hindi
('68', 445, 14, 23, 837253) shall be deemed current.
('68', 445, 14, 24, 837278) This of course shall not apply to Urdu and Hindi as sectional languages.
('68', 445, 15, 25, 837351) 5. That in the choice of technical terms, specially political terminology, no
('68', 445, 16, 26, 837429) preference be given to Sanskrit terms as such, but as much room as possible be allowed for natural selection from among Urdu, Hindi and Sanskrit terms.
('68', 445, 17, 27, 837581) 6. That the Devnagari and the Arabic scripts shall both be considered current and
('68', 445, 18, 28, 837663) official, and that in all institutions whose policy is directed by the official promoters of Hindustani, facilities shall be provided for learning both scripts.
('68', 445, 19, 29, 837824) There may be friends to whom these suggestions will look like Muslim demands.

('68', 446, 1, 2, 838159) They are not.
('68', 446, 1, 3, 838173) But I know that unless an assurance of some such kind is given by you and the Parishad, there can be no question of Muslim literary effort being harnessed in the cause of a common language.
('68', 446, 1, 4, 838363) So I have submitted these suggestions to you.
('68', 446, 1, 5, 838409) If they are extravagant, I know you will pardon me, and if they are unjustified, they will not offend you.
('68', 446, 1, 6, 838516) So far as I am concerned I have only wanted to do my duty, and to show, by an appeal to you, my unlimited respect for your judgment and my confidence in your deep feeling of justice and tolerance.

('68', 446, 4, 9, 838743) POPULARIZE HINDUSTANI 1
('68', 446, 5, 10, 838767) The All India Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, the twenty fifth session of which was
('68', 446, 6, 11, 838843) held at Nagpur during the week end, has two main objects before it: to develop Hindi literature and popularize Hindi throughout the country.
('68', 446, 6, 12, 838984) We shall consider here the latter object mainly.
('68', 446, 6, 13, 839033) The need for a national language is undeniable.
('68', 446, 6, 14, 839081) That English cannot possibly be that language is equally undeniable.
('68', 446, 6, 15, 839150) The popular form of Hindi or of Urdu, generally called Hindustani, has alone the prospect of being a perfect national language if earnest efforts are made to popularize this form in every possible way, particularly by developing Hindustani literature, that is to say, Hindi and Urdu literature without a large admixture of classical words.
('68', 446, 7, 16, 839490) CALL IT HINDUSTANI
('68', 446, 8, 17, 839509) Unfortunately, however, this national aim is not precisely understood.
('68', 446, 8, 18, 839580) Many, who
('68', 446, 9, 19, 839590) possess wrong notions of purity of language or literary elegance, persist in using too many classical expressions, the Hindus from Sanskrit and the Muslims from Persian and Arabic.
('68', 446, 9, 20, 839771) Sometimes this tendency is deliberately fostered by communalists, whence has arisen the Hindi Urdu controversy.
('68', 446, 9, 21, 839883) Babu Rajendra Prasad much deplored this spirit of exclusiveness both because it hindered the growth of national language and because it widened the gulf between the authors and the common readers.
('68', 446, 9, 22, 840080) He rightly commended the use of a simple language and at the same time urged the absorption of foreign words wherever necessary.
('68', 446, 9, 23, 840209) He would have brought out his point more clearly if he had definitely suggested that the language which should be specially cultivated should be Hindustani.
('68', 446, 9, 24, 840366) That is, we believe, the suggestion made by Gandhiji himself at the Nagpur Conference.
('68', 446, 9, 25, 840453) The most effective way to end once for all the Hindi Urdu controversy and to develop a national language is not only to propagate a simple or popular form of Hindi
('68', 446, 10, 26, 840617) 1 Vide Hindi or Hindustani, 9 5 1936. Only extracts from the article are
('68', 446, 11, 27, 840690) reproduced here.

('68', 447, 1, 2, 840749) and Urdu but also to call that language Hindustani, which in fact is its most appropriate name.
('68', 447, 1, 3, 840845) In order that much confusion and needless controversy regarding the respective claims of Hindi and Urdu may be avoided, may we suggest to the Congress President to issue definite instructions to all Congress organizations that the only national language to be recognized by them should be Hindustani and that Congressmen should not carry on propaganda in favour of either Urdu or Hndi being the national language?
('68', 447, 2, 4, 841259) USE BOTH SCRIPTS
('68', 447, 3, 5, 841276) The question of a common script for the national language has come very much to
('68', 447, 4, 6, 841356) the fore during the last two years or so.
('68', 447, 4, 7, 841398) Many suggest that the Nagari script should be the national one, with some improvements made therein, as it is the basis of the scripts of all the vernaculars derived from Sanskrit and, therefore, intelligible to a large majority of the people.
('68', 447, 4, 8, 841642) A few have suggested the use of the Roman script, and the rumour was abroad some time ago that President Jawaharlal had supported it.
('68', 447, 4, 9, 841776) He has now made it clear that, though he sees some advantage in it, he does not see any chance of its being adopted by any considerable community in the country.
('68', 447, 4, 10, 841938) Even as regard the Nagari script there is not at present that consensus of opinion in its favour which can justify its exclusive adoption in writing Hindustani.
('68', 447, 4, 11, 842099) Apart from this the claims of the Arabic script, which is being used in many Asiatic and African and even European countries as well as in India cannot lightly be ignored.
('68', 447, 4, 12, 842271) In the circumstances the best immediate approach to the problem is for every Indian to learn both the Nagari and the Arabic scripts.
('68', 447, 4, 13, 842404) That was Gandhiji's suggestion during the N.C.O. Movement and many national schools and colleges loyally followed it.
('68', 447, 4, 14, 842522) We believe he has not changed his mind on this point.
