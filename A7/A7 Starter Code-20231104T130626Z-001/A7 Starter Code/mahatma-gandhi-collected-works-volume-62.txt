('62', 0, 1, 2, 45) 1. A CASE FOR FASTING 1
('62', 0, 2, 3, 69) One who describes himself as a Harjian worker writes a long letter of which I give the following substance: With the Chairman of the local Harijan Seva Sangh and a sister I went the other day to a village.
('62', 0, 2, 4, 275) We were in a bullock cart.
('62', 0, 2, 5, 302) On the way the Chairman and the sister were engaged in conver sation exch anging jokes.
('62', 0, 2, 6, 390) The sister seemed to be fatigued and lay in the Chair mans lap.
('62', 0, 2, 7, 454) This familiarity somewhat startled me.
('62', 0, 2, 8, 493) On returning we were to take the train to the city from which we had started.
('62', 0, 2, 9, 571) We had to wait for a few hours at the station.
('62', 0, 2, 10, 618) The Chairman and the sister occu pied a bench.
('62', 0, 2, 11, 665) I sat on the platform ground.
('62', 0, 2, 12, 695) It was a moonlight night.
('62', 0, 2, 13, 721) I had a mind to test them, for I thought that there was some thing wrong with them.
('62', 0, 2, 14, 805) I, therefore, pretended that I would sleep and told the Chairman: We have yet to wait for some time.
('62', 0, 2, 15, 906) If you dont mind I would sleep for a while.
('62', 0, 2, 16, 950) I am tired.
('62', 0, 2, 17, 962) Will you wake me up when the train arrives? Hearing this, the Chairman seemed to be delighted over my proposal and he readily permitted me to sleep.
('62', 0, 2, 18, 1111) I lay down and pretended that I was in deep sleep.
('62', 0, 2, 19, 1162) In order to make sure that I was asleep he called out.
('62', 0, 2, 20, 1217) Not having any response from me he felt free to take what liberties he liked with the sister.
('62', 0, 2, 21, 1311) They quietly went into a cluster of trees near by.
('62', 0, 2, 22, 1362) After some time they returned and when the time for the train drew near, he woke me up.
('62', 0, 2, 23, 1450) I did not like this indecency between the Chairman and the sister.
('62', 0, 2, 24, 1517) I recalled your 21 days fast and the rea sons which you had given for it.
('62', 0, 2, 25, 1591) I took some of the co workers into confidence.
('62', 0, 2, 26, 1638) They tackled the Chairman, but he put on a bold front and not only denied the charge of indecency but charged me with jealousy and designs upon the Chairmanship of the local organi zation.
('62', 0, 2, 27, 1827) What am I to do in the circumstance ?
('62', 0, 2, 28, 1865) I have omitted unnecessary details from the letter.
('62', 0, 2, 29, 1917) let not the reader try to guess the names of the actors and the scene of the tra gedy.
('62', 0, 2, 30, 2004) Idle curiosity should be avoided.
('62', 0, 2, 31, 2038) I am drawing public atten tion to my correspondents letter to serve as a warning to all Harijan workers.
('62', 0, 2, 32, 2143) Let us, therefore, examine it.
('62', 0, 2, 33, 2174) In the first instance, the correspondent did wrong in wishing to test his companions and exposing them to temptation.
('62', 0, 2, 34, 2292) It is always a bad business to become detectives over co workers; and if, without

('62', 1, 0, 1, 2436) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 2
('62', 1, 1, 2, 2476) wishing it, we discover any moral or other lapses on their part, our business should be not to gossip about them, but immediately to draw, in a gentle manner, the companions attention to them.
('62', 1, 1, 3, 2669) Had my correspondent, when he first scented danger, put the Chairman on his guard, he would have saved him from the lapse, assuming, of course, that the correspondent has given a true version of the tragedy.
('62', 1, 1, 4, 2877) But, instead of taking the straight course, he adopted the crooked course of testing the couple.
('62', 1, 1, 5, 2974) We are all fallible human beings ever exposed to temptations.
('62', 1, 1, 6, 3036) Fortunately for us, theres many a slip twixt the cup and the lip.
('62', 1, 1, 7, 3102) Very few are saved from succumbing to temptations, if there is no external interruption.
('62', 1, 1, 8, 3191) There is no certainty that the corres pondent himself, exposed to the same temptation, might not have fallen as the Chairman is said by him to have fallen.
('62', 1, 1, 9, 3347) Indeed, had he been a little thoughtful, a little considerate towards his companions, he could have prevented their complete fall, by giving up the pretence of sleeping and gently pulling them up.
('62', 1, 1, 10, 3544) I know cases in which such warnings have proved the saving of people.
('62', 1, 1, 11, 3614) Thus, it seems to me that this Harijan worker signally failed in his duty towards his friends and fellow workers.
('62', 1, 1, 12, 3728) He has, however, asked the question, what he could do.
('62', 1, 1, 13, 3783) I do not propose to answer the question from his standpoint.
('62', 1, 1, 14, 3844) Evi dently he is anxious to know, not how the parties can be brought to repentance, but how they can be exposed, and the charges against him disproved.
('62', 1, 1, 15, 3996) It is none of his business to expose his companions, as it was none of his business to tempt them to fall but his business now is undoubtedly to give a private notice to the chairman that he would have to undertake a fast till the Chairman confesses his guilt, or if that is beyond his capacity, to undertake a fairly prolonged fast, so as to bring home the guilt to the parties.
('62', 1, 1, 16, 4376) Such a fast cannot be taken publicly.
('62', 1, 1, 17, 4414) It is highly likely that the Chairman and the sister will realize the grievousness of their guilt, but it is not at all unlikely that they might harden their hearts and ignore the fast.
('62', 1, 1, 18, 4600) That ought not to be a matter of any concern for my correspondent.
('62', 1, 1, 19, 4667) He will have done his penance for having made himself a detective over his friend and it will be some relief to him from the oppression of the charge brought against him of jealousy and ambition to become the Chairman of the local Seva Sangh.
('62', 1, 1, 20, 4910) It is hardly necessary to emphasize the obvious truth that the fast, if it is at all taken, should be taken only if the Harijan worker believes in its necessity and efficacy and if he can take it with a clean heart.
('62', 1, 1, 21, 5126) It may be that the parties charged by my correspondent have
('62', 2, 0, 1, 5186) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 3
('62', 2, 1, 2, 5231) not erred.
('62', 2, 1, 3, 5242) Let us hope that they have not.
('62', 2, 1, 4, 5274) But I know that such errors have occurred before now.
('62', 2, 1, 5, 5328) Let the incident described here serve as a warning to all workers.
('62', 2, 1, 6, 5395) It furnishes, in my opinion, a clear case for fasting.
('62', 2, 1, 7, 5450) Harijan service is no sinecure; it is a movement for bringing about a revolutionary change in the mentality of millions of human beings.
('62', 2, 1, 8, 5587) It is like walking on the edge of a sword and, therefore, requires the greatest vigilance over self on the part of the workers.

('62', 2, 3, 11, 5766) WARDHA, October 8, 1933 This selection 2 of shlokas for the Gitapraveshika was made last year (1932) in Yeravda Mandir.
('62', 2, 3, 12, 5886) My third son Ramdas was in the same jail.
('62', 2, 3, 13, 5928) The authorities permitted me to meet or write to him occasionally.
('62', 2, 3, 14, 5995) Ramadas used to read the Gita but could not understand it fully.
('62', 2, 3, 15, 6060) Ramdas does not lack bhaktibhava 3; he has the shraddha 4 too.
('62', 2, 3, 16, 6123) I selected simple and devotional verses from the Gita and sent them over to him so as to help him.
('62', 2, 3, 17, 6222) Ramdas liked the collection.
('62', 2, 3, 18, 6251) I further encouraged him by calling the selection Ramagita 5. Baba Raghavdas 6 happened to see the collection when it was with Kakasaheb; he went through it and felt it would prove useful to Harijan workers.
('62', 2, 3, 19, 6459) With that in view he asked for my permission to haveit published.
('62', 2, 3, 20, 6525) Being no pundit myself I could not decide if the collection was worthy of publication.
('62', 2, 3, 21, 6612) Vinoba, Kakasaheb and Balakrishna 7 of the Ashram were all here.
('62', 2, 3, 22, 6677) All the three are devoted students of the Gita.
('62', 2, 3, 23, 6725) I told the Baba that I had no objection to the collection being published provided the three Ashram inmates

('62', 3, 1, 2, 7340) approved of it.
('62', 3, 1, 3, 7356) All the three had consultation among themselves and advised me, with a view to increasing its utility, to omit three of the verses and to add four new ones.
('62', 3, 1, 4, 7513) The collection thus revised is now presented to men and women workers as well as to other lovers of the Gita.
('62', 3, 1, 5, 7623) I hopeand it is also my intentionthat the collection will be read as an introduction and nothing more and that a study of the Gita as a whole will be undertaken only after it had been fairly digested.
('62', 3, 1, 6, 7824) All the same it should be remembered that merely memorizing or knowing the meaning of the Praveshika or [even] the whole of the Gita is not going to help realize the atman.
('62', 3, 1, 7, 7997) The Gita is to be put into practice.
('62', 3, 1, 8, 8034) When one has knowledge of its techincal phraseology and has taken to heart its central idea of non attachment, it becomes easier to understand the Gita.

('62', 3, 3, 11, 8286) DEAR THAKKAR BAPA, I have your letter about the amounts of Harijan fund received by me.
('62', 3, 3, 12, 8374) I have the account from Mathuradas.
('62', 3, 3, 13, 8410) I am simply waiting for Chimanlal who is expected to reach here shortly.
('62', 3, 3, 14, 8483) As soon as he comes I shall attend to the matter.
('62', 3, 3, 15, 8533) I have also your letter about the tour.
('62', 3, 3, 16, 8573) Your second letter has crossed mine.
('62', 3, 3, 17, 8610) I am quite clear in my mind that the whole of the Cen tral Provinces should be finished at once.
('62', 3, 3, 18, 8707) I do not mind the cold weather of the Punjab.
('62', 3, 3, 19, 8753) Therefore it does not matter where I am during the cold weather.
('62', 3, 3, 20, 8818) Nor do I mind the hot weather.
('62', 3, 3, 21, 8849) What you have to guard against is the rainy season.
('62', 3, 3, 22, 8901) Therefore, June and July should be given to those provinces where the rains do not set in early.
('62', 3, 3, 23, 8998) I was considerably relieved as you must have been to find Bakhale withdrawing from the Municipal contest.
('62', 3, 3, 24, 9104) We will now discuss with Mr. Kodanda Rao the principle underlying the advice that you and I tendered.
('62', 3, 3, 25, 9206) I have told him that I would welcome the discussion.

('62', 4, 2, 3, 9436) October 8, 1933
('62', 4, 3, 4, 9452) MY DEAR GHANSHYAMDAS, I have your letter 1. The difficulty you raise is there and it was in anticipation of it that I suggested the formation of a trust board.
('62', 4, 3, 5, 9612) My idea is that the property should be held by these trustees permanently, under very defined conditions, with the right even to sell.
('62', 4, 3, 6, 9747) You and Thakkar Bapa should be permanent members, irrespective of what happens to the popular organization.
('62', 4, 3, 7, 9855) This proposal disposes of the question from which has arisen the larger one that I am not prepared to discuss in this letter for want of time.
('62', 4, 3, 8, 9998) Meanwhile I would ask you to study the constitution of the All India Spinners Association.
('62', 4, 3, 9, 10089) We may postpone the discussion till we meet, and seeing that I am here up to the 7th of Novemeber, it might be possible for you to come, even if it be for that one question.
('62', 4, 3, 10, 10263) You have referred to the proposed hostel in Delhi.
('62', 4, 3, 11, 10314) In view of our possessing the Ashram ground and buildings, do you think there is any urgency for the Delhi proposal?
('62', 4, 3, 12, 10431) Should we not wait and see how the Sabarmati plan progresses before venturing upon another big scheme?
('62', 4, 3, 13, 10534) I am inclined to think that we ought to concentrate our atten tion upon making the Sabarmati scheme a thorough success and it will tax the energy of many of us to make it so.
('62', 4, 3, 14, 10709) I hope you are keeping well.
('62', 4, 3, 15, 10738) What about the nose?
('62', 4, 3, 16, 10759) Weather in Delhi ought to be very fine at this time of the year.

('62', 4, 5, 20, 10980) But by the acceptance of your offer we will shortly be in possession of a valuable peroperty.
('62', 4, 5, 21, 11074) The question will thus immediately arise as to who will be the owner of this property.
('62', 4, 5, 22, 11161) Will it be the Harijan Mandal ?
('62', 4, 5, 23, 11193) If so, then the Harijan Mandal would for all practical purposes mean the persons by whose sufferance it exists and there is no such thing as sufferance in our socitey so far.
('62', 4, 5, 24, 11368) Therefore, we have to decide what sort of constitution we are to have in future.

('62', 5, 8, 10, 11733) October 8, 1933 Till yesterday I had no idea that I would have to face a large assembly like this, nor did I imagine that I would have to make a speech.
('62', 5, 8, 11, 11886) I cannot speak very loudly.
('62', 5, 8, 12, 11914) Doctor friends have advised me not to try it.
('62', 5, 8, 13, 11960) That is why I have jotted down a few points.
('62', 5, 8, 14, 12005) You are aware that till the 3rd of August next year I wish to engage myself mainly in Harijan work.
('62', 5, 8, 15, 12105) I have tried to study Hinduism since my youth and have endeavoured to shape my conduct according to what I was taught in my childhood.
('62', 5, 8, 16, 12240) I have studied the Hindu scriptures to the best fo my ability.
('62', 5, 8, 17, 12303) I have studied the sacred books of other religions also with reverence.
('62', 5, 8, 18, 12375) Right from my childhood I have believed that untouchability as we know it today has no place in Hinduism and that it is a great evil which has somehow entered it.
('62', 5, 8, 19, 12538) Study and experience have confirmed me in this view.
('62', 5, 8, 20, 12591) I am convinced that Hinduism will perish if we do not get rid of this evil of untouchability.
('62', 5, 8, 21, 12685) Removal of untouchability does not mean merely that we should touch the people whom we regard as untouchables.
('62', 5, 8, 22, 12796) Of course we should touch them, whenever necessary, with love.
('62', 5, 8, 23, 12859) But removal of untouchability means much more than that.
('62', 5, 8, 24, 12916) It means that we should give up the feeling of high and low.
('62', 5, 8, 25, 12977) In a sense the feeling of high and low is found prevailing in all countries.
('62', 5, 8, 26, 13054) But is cannot be said that this
('62', 5, 9, 27, 13086) 1 Owing to his weak state of health Gandhiji himself did not speak.
('62', 5, 9, 28, 13154) The speech, which was in Hindi, was read out at the meeting.
('62', 5, 9, 29, 13215) No Hindi report being available, this has been translated from Chandrashankar Shuklas weekly letter.
('62', 6, 0, 1, 13316) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 7
('62', 6, 1, 2, 13361) feeling is part of any religion.
('62', 6, 1, 3, 13394) It is asserted that it is part of Hindusm; but if we examine objectively the fundamental principles of Hinduism, we can see that it too does not sanction such a feeling.
('62', 6, 1, 4, 13564) It is true, of course, that our daily conduct is strongly influenced by this notion, and we have been taught to believe that it is a special feature of Hinduism.
('62', 6, 1, 5, 13726) One of the principles of Hinduism is that we should not do to others what we would not like to be done to ourselves.
('62', 6, 1, 6, 13843) In another verse having the same meaning, it is stated that we should regard all living creatures as we regard ourselves.
('62', 6, 1, 7, 13965) How the feeling of high and low crept into such a religion is beyond my understanding.
('62', 6, 1, 8, 14052) In other words, it is the duty of every Hindu to fulfil completely the pledge that the leaders had taken on behalf of the Hindu community on 25th 1 September last year at a meeting in Bombay presided over by Malaviyaji Maharaj.
('62', 6, 1, 9, 14280) I hope that all of you who have come here will keep that pledge.
('62', 6, 1, 10, 14345) It was categorically stated in that Resolution that the Harijans have the same right as the other Hindus to the use of public temples, public wells and public schools.
('62', 6, 1, 11, 14513) When vast numbers of caste Hindus undergo change of heart and we fully appreciate and follow the dharma of compassion, not only will there be unity between them and Harijans but we shall also live in amity with followers of other faiths and the present antagonisms will completely disappear.
('62', 6, 1, 12, 14805) I pray to God that He grant us enough strength to purify ourselves thus and that the evil of untouchability that has crept into Hinduism be completely abolished.

('62', 7, 3, 17, 15842) Krishna (Nehru) will be married to Gunottam Hutheesing on the 20th in Allahabad.
('62', 7, 3, 18, 15923) I am not attending the wedding.
('62', 7, 3, 19, 15955) They dont expect me to do so, either.
('62', 7, 3, 20, 15993) I have already written a letter giving my blessings.
('62', 7, 3, 21, 16046) You also should write.
('62', 7, 3, 22, 16069) Kishorelal will come here in two or three days.
('62', 7, 3, 23, 16117) Jamnalalji is of the opinion that Anandi should be betrothed.
('62', 7, 3, 24, 16179) I also feel that that should be done .
('62', 7, 3, 25, 16218) 3 She says, however, that she does not wish to get married just now.
('62', 7, 3, 26, 16287) But I think she will marry if I advise her to do so.
('62', 7, 3, 27, 16340) Let me have your views.
('62', 7, 3, 28, 16364) If you can, see Lakshmidas and ask him his views.
('62', 7, 3, 29, 16414) I am writing to him.
('62', 7, 3, 30, 16435) 4I have already written to Mani.
('62', 7, 3, 31, 16468) Perhaps she may not come even with Mridu 5. Jamnalal is going to Bombay today for two or three days for private work.
('62', 7, 3, 32, 16586) My tour will probably commence on November 8. I shall pro bably be accompanied by Thakkar Bapa, Chandrashankar, Mira, Nayar, and Ramnarayan Choudhri.

('62', 8, 7, 11, 17502) I do hope Mother will be strong enough to attend to the wedding.
('62', 8, 7, 12, 17567) I got today the accompanying from Saraladevi 1. I have told her Indu 2 is left free to do as she chooses and that she is not likely to entertain any marrigae proposal as she is still studying.
('62', 8, 7, 13, 17760) I have told her too that I am forwarding the letter to you.
('62', 8, 7, 14, 17820) If Indu was at all prepared to consider a marriage proposal, I do regard Dipak 3 to be a good match.
('62', 8, 7, 15, 17921) Hardikar 4 and Kamala Chattopadhyay came in today.
('62', 8, 7, 16, 17972) Hardikar is suffering from fistula and would need an operation.
('62', 8, 7, 17, 18036) I shall know more tomorrow.
('62', 8, 7, 18, 18064) Jamnalalji has gone to Bombay for helping a friend who is in financial trouble.
('62', 8, 7, 19, 18144) He will be back in four days.
('62', 8, 7, 20, 18174) My tour commences on 8th November, all being otherwise well.

('62', 10, 2, 3, 19668) October 10, 1933
('62', 10, 3, 4, 19685) BHAI THAKKAR BAPA, I also had a letter about Rohtak, and had read about the matter in the papers too.
('62', 10, 3, 5, 19787) Lala Sham Lal, thought he is in L 1 2 ahore, has assured me that he will look into the matter on behalf of Rohtak, expecially as he is minting money in Lahore.
('62', 10, 3, 6, 19947) We have no choice but to put up with Mr. Youngs antics.
('62', 10, 3, 7, 20003) After all, the axe can strike at the tree only if a wooden handle helps it.
('62', 10, 3, 8, 20079) You seem to have upset Mathuradas.
('62', 10, 3, 9, 20114) I read a copy of his letter to you.
('62', 10, 3, 10, 20150) I wonder what you could have written.
('62', 10, 3, 11, 20188) Whatever that was, I know that Mathuradas is not at fault in the least.
('62', 10, 3, 12, 20260) He is always very careful about things.
('62', 10, 3, 13, 20300) But he easily gets angry.
('62', 10, 3, 14, 20326) Nobody should get angry with old men like us who have grown up as slaves, even if they blurt out anything thoughtless.
('62', 10, 3, 15, 20445) But can we expect young people to bear with old men ?
('62', 10, 3, 16, 20499) Please, therefore, apply some balm.
('62', 10, 3, 17, 20535) I shall of course write to Mathuradas.
('62', 10, 3, 18, 20574) 1 A copy of the letter 2 to Dr. Bidhan is enclosed.
('62', 10, 3, 19, 20626) I have sent a copy of it to Devi Babu and also written to him in Hindi.
('62', 10, 3, 20, 20698) I enclose the letter received frm Assam, and also a copy of my reply.
('62', 10, 4, 21, 20768) I see that I shall be confined here till November 7 at any rate.
('62', 10, 4, 22, 20833) In a way I like that, because slowly I am disposing of the work which has accumulated and can give time to the visitors.
('62', 10, 4, 23, 20954) Probably I shall also regain more strength during the time.
('62', 10, 4, 24, 21014) Jamnalalji had unexpectedly to go to Bombay to help a friend, and so he might not have been able to send you a draft of the programme here.
('62', 10, 4, 25, 21154) He will return within four days.
('62', 10, 4, 26, 21187) If you leave out the C.P. 4 and draw up another programme as I have suggested, you will be ready with it sooner.
('62', 10, 4, 27, 21300) The entire C.P. must be covered at one time.
('62', 10, 4, 28, 21345) Our party will include (1) you, (2) I, (3) Mirabehn, (4) Chandrashankar, (5) Ramnarayan, (6) Nayar and anybody else whom you might bring with

('62', 11, 3, 8, 21863) WARDHA, October 10, 1933 CHI.
('62', 11, 3, 9, 21893) MATHURADAS, I have received your letters.
('62', 11, 3, 10, 21935) I can see that you do not want me to write anything to Gokhale right now.
('62', 11, 3, 11, 22009) I have seen Gokhales letter in the Chronicle today.
('62', 11, 3, 12, 22061) Your letter to Thakkar Bapa is full of anger.
('62', 11, 3, 13, 22107) You seem to have lost sight of one rule.
('62', 11, 3, 14, 22148) You ought not to read in letters what isscored off.
('62', 11, 3, 15, 22200) And if you happen to read it, you ought not to read any meaning in it.
('62', 11, 3, 16, 22271) A person should be given a chance to modify his views.
('62', 11, 3, 17, 22326) It is sheer ignorance to attribute wickedness even to the most wicked thought once it has been modified.
('62', 11, 3, 18, 22431) The world would not go on in peace even for a minute if we started throwing our views at one an other.
('62', 11, 3, 19, 22534) I think you have been unnecessarily angry.
('62', 11, 3, 20, 22577) Thakkar Bapa de serves to be complimented on his alertness.
('62', 11, 3, 21, 22637) Moreover, his age and his dedicated service of so many years give him a right to say a great deal.
('62', 11, 3, 22, 22736) When he says something, there is no sting behind it.
('62', 11, 3, 23, 22789) If there is anybodys mistake in this, one might say it is on my part.
('62', 11, 3, 24, 22859) I have written at this length because I would not like even a trace of anger in you.
('62', 11, 4, 25, 22944) Now for the Ashram.
('62', 11, 4, 26, 22964) I think you are mistaken in the matter.
('62', 11, 4, 27, 23004) If the Government does not take possession and we allow the land to re main untended it means we are harbouring a feeling of revenge.
('62', 11, 4, 28, 23138) It would be an unnatural situation.
('62', 11, 4, 29, 23174) There was nothing to prevent the Government from taking possession of the land and letting it lie fallow.
('62', 11, 4, 30, 23280) But on what ground can we allow the land to remain fallow if the government does not take it over?
('62', 11, 4, 31, 23379) In that case, why should we not burn down our movable property?
('62', 11, 4, 32, 23443) According to what you are saying,

('62', 12, 1, 2, 23657) those who burnt their crops acted wisely.
('62', 12, 1, 3, 23699) I am convinced that the Satyagraha Ashram will fulfil its purpose if the land is donated to Harijans.
('62', 12, 1, 4, 23801) This is of greater moment than if the land was to remain with the Government.
('62', 12, 1, 5, 23879) Even if it should go to the Government, we would always want to claim it back in the end.
('62', 12, 1, 6, 23969) But in this case, the Ashram inmates gave it up for good and placed themselves in the hands of God.
('62', 12, 1, 7, 24069) If we examine the problem from this point of view, it would be clear that the path adopted alone does credit to a satyagrahi.
('62', 12, 1, 8, 24195) There has been no place here for greed for money.
('62', 12, 1, 9, 24245) It was merely a matter of what was right, that is, of non violence.
('62', 12, 1, 10, 24313) The Government may well want to turn this land into a wilderness, but we should not let that happen if we can help it.
('62', 12, 1, 11, 24432) If you are not convinced by these two arguments, write to me again.
('62', 12, 1, 12, 24500) It should not be difficult to convince you in this matter.

('62', 13, 9, 25, 26670) You are completely on the wrong track in this matter.
('62', 13, 9, 26, 26724) To let the buildings and the land fall into ruins if the Government does not take possession of them would be vindictive and unnatural.
('62', 13, 9, 27, 26860) If the Government had taken over the Ashram and then let it fall into ruin, we would have had nothing to say against it.
('62', 13, 9, 28, 26981) But on what principle can we let the land be ruined if the Government does not take over?
('62', 13, 9, 29, 27071) If we do that, why should we also not

('62', 14, 1, 2, 27155) burn the movable property?
('62', 14, 1, 3, 27182) According to the principle which you apply, those who burnt their crops acted wisely.
('62', 14, 1, 4, 27268) I am convinced that by offering the Ashram land to the cause of Harijans, we shall have completely fulfilled the aim for which the Ashram existed.
('62', 14, 1, 5, 27415) Its aim will have been fulfilled better in this manner than by its remaining in the possession of the Government.
('62', 14, 1, 6, 27529) In handing over the Ashram to the Government, we secretly hoped that one day we would get back its possesion.
('62', 14, 1, 7, 27639) But by taking the step that we have taken, the inmates of the Ashram have given up their claim permanently and trusted their future wholly to God.
('62', 14, 1, 8, 27786) From whatever point of view we look at the matter, we find that the course we have adopted is the only right one for satyagrahis.
('62', 14, 1, 9, 27916) The desire to save property has been no motive at all in this transaction.
('62', 14, 1, 10, 27991) It was only a question of what was right and consistent with ahimsa.
('62', 14, 1, 11, 28060) The Government may let the whole country be ruined, but we should not if we can help.
('62', 14, 1, 12, 28146) If this does not satisfy you, you may ask me again.
('62', 14, 1, 13, 28198) It shouldnt be difficult to satisfy your doubts in this matter.

('62', 14, 5, 17, 28334) October 11, 1933 You seem to have forgotten one rule, namely, that one should never read what has been scored out by the writer of a letter.
('62', 14, 5, 18, 28475) If one reads it by chance, one should not pay any attention to it.
('62', 14, 5, 19, 28542) A person must be permitted to revise his ideas.
('62', 14, 5, 20, 28590) It is lack of understanding to think ill of a person for even the most wicked thought, after he has corrected himself.
('62', 14, 5, 21, 28709) If all of us revealed all our thoughts to one another, people wouldnt be happy even for a minute.

('62', 15, 3, 4, 29038) DEAR FRIEND, You will pardon me for being a little late in acknowledging your letter of 6th inst.
('62', 15, 3, 5, 29136) The fact is that my capacity for dealing with the in creasing correspondence is limited.
('62', 15, 3, 6, 29225) With reference to the suggestion made by you, evidently you do not recognize my limitations.
('62', 15, 3, 7, 29318) In the first instance, I am not at all sure whether the Government would favour the idea of my visiting Midnapore and if it did, whether it would give me a free hand to work in the manner I might think best.
('62', 15, 3, 8, 29526) Above all, you know the view that I have expressed.
('62', 15, 3, 9, 29578) 1 Even a confirmed peace maker like me can have no chance whatsoever if I have to address only one party of violence.
('62', 15, 3, 10, 29696) I regard both the Government and the terrorists as representing vio lence; that of the terrorists is unorganized, insane and wholly ineffec tive from my standpoint, and that of the Government is orga nized, deliberate and blasting though also wholly ineffective again from my standpoint.
('62', 15, 3, 11, 29984) I should have short shrift from the terrorists if I could have no influence with the superior party of violence.
('62', 15, 3, 12, 30097) Even so, do not for one moment believe that because I do not go to Midnapore I exert no influence over the terrorists.
('62', 15, 3, 13, 30216) It may be a negative kind.
('62', 15, 3, 14, 30243) I know what handicap I am working under.
('62', 15, 3, 15, 30284) But I have boundless confidence in my creed of non violence and in the end, not so distant as many people may imagine, non violence will visibly succeed.
('62', 15, 3, 16, 30438) Yours sincerely,

('62', 16, 3, 4, 30762) DEAR THAKKAR BAPA, Herewith letters with copies of the correspondence with the au thorities from Sahu and a copy of my reply to him.
('62', 16, 3, 5, 30895) It might be as well for you to address a formal letter to the Collector or to the Home Member, Bihar and Orissa, just setting forth the difficulties unnec essarily created in the way of the prosecution of the movement.
('62', 16, 3, 6, 31114) I have your wire about N. Three days ago, just after the prayer meeting, she suddenly disappeared.
('62', 16, 3, 7, 31213) Of late, her behaviour had been very strange.
('62', 16, 3, 8, 31259) Her brain has, undoubtedly, softened.
('62', 16, 3, 9, 31297) I have sent you a telegram in reply which, I hope, you have received.
('62', 16, 3, 10, 31367) You need not waste any time over her and if she presses herself on your attention she may be reported to the police, though I hardly think that she will do that.
('62', 16, 3, 11, 31529) Dr. Sharma has telegraphed me and I have advised him not to take any notice of her at all.

('62', 18, 2, 3, 33198) MANY THANKS From friends all over India and from the West I have had many telegrams of the birthday greetings.
('62', 18, 2, 4, 33309) I am deeply thankful to them for these.
('62', 18, 2, 5, 33349) They will excuse me for my inability to send personal acknow ledgements.
('62', 18, 2, 6, 33422) I would have these friends to pray that God may make me worthy of their greetings.
('62', 18, 2, 7, 33505) I know that the senders expect that I should be rendering some service to humanity.
('62', 18, 2, 8, 33589) The wish is always persent.
('62', 18, 2, 9, 33617) God alone knows how far I succeed in the effort.
('62', 18, 2, 10, 33666) FORTHCOMING TOUR
('62', 18, 3, 11, 33683) If all goes well, my forthcoming tour for the Harijan cause should commence as from 8th November.
('62', 18, 3, 12, 33781) I am said to be making substantial progress and Dr. Khare, who is just now in charge, is of opinion that I could safely commence the tour from the date ment ioned.
('62', 18, 3, 13, 33945) But this does not mean that I can cope with crowded pro grammes as I used to before.
('62', 18, 3, 14, 34030) It is proposed to avoid travelling for two consecutive days, preferably Sundays and Mondays, in the week, to enable me to deal with Harijan editing and correspondence.
('62', 18, 3, 15, 34198) As usual I shall make collections wherever I am taken.
('62', 18, 3, 16, 34253) I should like to meet sanatanists at all places.
('62', 18, 3, 17, 34302) I have no doubt that much opposition to the movement is due to misunderstanding.
('62', 18, 3, 18, 34383) Naturally I must meet Harijans everywhere and there must be on the programme visits to Harijan quarters.
('62', 18, 3, 19, 34488) Late hours should be avoided.
('62', 18, 3, 20, 34518) Those places that feel tempted, in spite of the handicaps suggested here, to send invitations should send them to Thakkar Bapa as early as possible, so as to avoid alterations in the programme and disappointment.
('62', 18, 3, 21, 34731) All spectacular demonstrations, not required for the cause itself, should be avoided.
('62', 18, 3, 22, 34817) Every pice should be economized.
('62', 18, 3, 23, 34850) If addresses are to be presented at all, they should contain a brief description of the work done and statistics regarding Harijans, their occupations and economic condi tion, instead of a recital of my many excellences, which may be ex pected to take care of themselves, if there are any.
('62', 18, 4, 24, 35140) WILL OTHER UNIVERSITIES FOLLOW?
('62', 18, 5, 25, 35172) N. K. Behere, a member of the Nagpur University and C.P. High School Board, writes to say that he moved a resolution that students belonging to the Depressed Classes and the aboriginal tribes
('62', 19, 0, 1, 35364) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 20
('62', 19, 1, 2, 35405) should not be charged examination fees, that he is glad to say that it was passed, with the addition of the clauseup to the year 1940 by the University and with a time limit of five years by the High School Board, and that, therefore, no examination fees will be charged against these students from the Matriculation to the M.A. or L.L.B. examinations for these periods, as far as the Central Provinces are concerned.
('62', 19, 1, 3, 35823) I congratulate the Nagpur University, the High School Board and the mover on the passing of the resolution.
('62', 19, 1, 4, 35931) The addition of the time limit does not detract anything from the resolution.
('62', 19, 1, 5, 36009) It is a token of the optimism of the members of the respective bodies.
('62', 19, 1, 6, 36080) They evidently think that in five to seven years the economic status of the classes exempted will have so improved that they will not need the exemption any longer.
('62', 19, 1, 7, 36245) May that optimism be justified !
('62', 19, 1, 8, 36278) Will the other Indian Univversities and Boards copy the excellent example set by those of the Central provinces ?

('62', 19, 3, 11, 36442) Deenabandhu Andrews writes : 1
('62', 19, 4, 12, 36473) A century ago a far more terrible form of mans inhumanity to man that untouchability was abolished in the West.
('62', 19, 4, 13, 36585) Slavery made men and women into chattels, to be bought and sold and possessed by their owners.
('62', 19, 4, 14, 36680) Negroes from Africa were transported on ships like cattle and set to work in the sugar plantations just like beasts of burden .
('62', 19, 4, 15, 36808) The results of this slave traffic were to create a colour problem in America and elsewhere which has never yet been solved.
('62', 19, 4, 16, 36932) It has been doubted whether any great moral reform has ever been carried through from purely humanitarian motives.
('62', 19, 4, 17, 37047) The nearest to reach the standard was the abolition of slavery.
('62', 19, 4, 18, 37111) Great Britain paid  20,000,000 out of its own revenue in order to get rid of the evil.
('62', 19, 4, 19, 37198) Therefore, it is not right to say that in politics philanthropy never gains its own victory.
('62', 19, 4, 20, 37291) In the year 1833, philanthropy won.
('62', 19, 5, 21, 37327) What then will happen in 1933 ?
('62', 19, 5, 22, 37359) Surely if India could abolish altogether, within the present year, untouchability, .
('62', 19, 5, 23, 37444) that would be the greatest philanthropic act of all.
('62', 19, 5, 24, 37497) Would that Deenabandhus hope were fulfilled.
('62', 19, 5, 25, 37542) Unless a miracle happens, the wholesale conversion of millions will not take place
('62', 19, 6, 26, 37625) 1 Only excerpts are reproduced here.
('62', 20, 0, 1, 37662) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 21
('62', 20, 1, 2, 37708) during the remaining months of this year and, may be, for many more years to come.
('62', 20, 1, 3, 37791) But what is the meaning of the abolition of untouchability and what was the meaning of the abolition of slavery in 1833 ?
('62', 20, 1, 4, 37913) The abo lition of slavery was a legislative act.
('62', 20, 1, 5, 37962) The slavery of the heart was not abolished then and even the lapse of a century has hardly abolished it altogether.
('62', 20, 1, 6, 38078) This is written, not to belittle the great act of 1833, but to clear our minds and to understand the limitations of the effort of 1833. Now, in the sense in which slavery was abolished in 1833, untou chability was abolished in 1932 at that representative meeting of Hindus assembled in Bombay in September 1932, 1 under the Chair manship of Pandit Malaviyaji.
('62', 20, 1, 7, 38438) It was no bogus affair.
('62', 20, 1, 8, 38462) It was signalized by the immediate establishment of the All India Anti untouchability Board.
('62', 20, 1, 9, 38555) There has been an incessant campaign against untouchability going on ever since, throughout the length and breadth of the land as the pages of Harijan can amply prove.
('62', 20, 1, 10, 38723) One life is being definitely held as hostage for the due fulfilment of the solemn pledge of the Hindus.
('62', 20, 1, 11, 38827) Let no one underrate the effort of 1932 by saying that, whereas the abolition of 1833 was an act of a legislature, that of 1932 was an act of a voluntary association and, therefore, lacking sanction.
('62', 20, 1, 12, 39027) In the nature of things the act of 1932 could not well be otherwise.
('62', 20, 1, 13, 39096) Slavery was a matter of contract enforceable at law, Untouchability as a religious institution is, as Deenabandhu Andrews rightly says, moral slavery.
('62', 20, 1, 14, 39247) This could not be abolished by law.
('62', 20, 1, 15, 39283) The only way in which it could be formally abolished was adopted in Bombay.
('62', 20, 1, 16, 39359) Nor, as I have already shown, does the act lack sanction.
('62', 20, 1, 17, 39417) The sanction, it is true, is moral.
('62', 20, 1, 18, 39453) But moral sanctions are in the end far more potent than legal sanctions.
('62', 20, 1, 19, 39526) Let the reader note that the Bills sought to be passed by the Central Legislature are not intended to be acts of abolition at all.
('62', 20, 1, 20, 39657) One is meant to regulate temple entry by Harijans and the other to withdraw legal recognition of untouchability.
('62', 20, 1, 21, 39770) Neither affects the religious recognition and social practice.
('62', 20, 1, 22, 39833) That is the function of the religious and social reformer.
('62', 20, 1, 23, 39892) The Bills are very much needed to expedite reform; they cannot abolish untouchability.
('62', 20, 1, 24, 39979) Untouchability is not a matter of contract.
('62', 20, 1, 25, 40023) Untouchables cannot be bought or sold.
('62', 20, 1, 26, 40062) Thus, I hope, it is clear that the abolition of untouchability analogous to that of slavery in 1833 definitely took place on 24th

('62', 21, 0, 1, 40261) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 22
('62', 21, 1, 2, 40302) September 1932. Its anniversary was duly celebrated on the 24th day of last September.
('62', 21, 1, 3, 40389) When the whole mass of Hindus will respond to the Resolution of Bombay will largely depend upon the earnestness of those who passed it and those who are now seeking to enforce it.
('62', 21, 1, 4, 40569) But that is a process of which it will not be possible to say it took place on a particular day.
('62', 21, 1, 5, 40666) And I know that Deenabandhu is not looking forward to any such definite day when the mass manifestation will be a single act for mankind to see.
('62', 21, 1, 6, 40811) What he wants, what I want and what every reformer is striving after is such a manifestation of the combined energy of Hindus as would show unmistakably to any passerby that Hinduism has shed the distinction between high and low and that there is in it neither high caste nor low caste nor outcaste, whether by birth or in fact.
('62', 21, 1, 7, 41140) A sinner is equal to the saint in the eye of God.
('62', 21, 1, 8, 41190) Both will have equal justice, and both an equal opportunity either to go forward or to go backward.
('62', 21, 1, 9, 41290) Both are His children, His creation.
('62', 21, 1, 10, 41327) A saint who consi ders himself superior to a sinner forfeits his sainthood and becomes worse than the sinner who, unlike the proud saint, knows not what he is doing.
('62', 21, 1, 11, 41493) The mission of anti untouchability organizations is perhaps the noblest of any that can be conceived.
('62', 21, 1, 12, 41595) Let us, therefore, pray with Deenabandhu Andrews that they may be blessed with enough spiritual power to melt the age long superstition that has corrupted Hindu society and that threatens to destroy Hinduism, if it does not react to the spirit of the times.

('62', 22, 1, 2, 41919) 25. WHAT ONE MAN CAN DO
('62', 22, 2, 3, 41943) A would be Harijan Sevak writes to the following effect: 1
('62', 22, 3, 4, 42002) I have little doubt that my correspondent missed a golden opportunity of serving both the poor sweeper and the orthodox family.
('62', 22, 3, 5, 42130) He should have gently remonstrated with the mother of the polluted girl and he would have drawn her wrath towards himself, even if he had not shamed her into repentance.
('62', 22, 3, 6, 42300) The sweeper would have felt the warmth of a friend in her need.
('62', 22, 3, 7, 42364) The mother and the other relatives of the girl would at least have been set athinking.
('62', 22, 3, 8, 42451) He would probably have been drawn into an argument.
('62', 22, 3, 9, 42503) Perhaps the whole village might have interested itself in the matter and if he had risen to the occasion, he would have laid a solid foundation for substantial service in the future.
('62', 22, 3, 10, 42686) Or he might have had a broken head.
('62', 22, 3, 11, 42722) That, too, would have been a good passport for further service.
('62', 22, 3, 12, 42786) It is clear to me that on such occasions, every lover of humanity should consider it his sacred duty to protect the helpless by tactful and gentle, yet coura geous, intervention.
('62', 22, 3, 13, 42965) Now for the general question.
('62', 22, 3, 14, 42995) Had we not lost self confidence, the question, what an insignificant man can do, would never have arisen.
('62', 22, 3, 15, 43101) No man is too insignificant for rendering personal service to those who may be in distress.
('62', 22, 3, 16, 43193) The art does not need previous training.
('62', 22, 3, 17, 43234) The ability to give effective help resides in every human being who has the will and the necessary courage.
('62', 22, 3, 18, 43342) Thus my correspondent could certainly go to the Harijan quarters of his village and befriend them in a variety of ways.
('62', 22, 3, 19, 43462) He could teach their children during his stay in the village.
('62', 22, 3, 20, 43524) He need not fear the interruption due to his absence.
('62', 22, 3, 21, 43578) For teaching does not mean only a knowledge of the three Rs.
('62', 22, 3, 22, 43639) It means many other things for Harijan humanity.
('62', 22, 3, 23, 43688) lessons in manners and sani tation are the indispensable preliminaries to the initiation into the three Rs.
('62', 22, 3, 24, 43796) The correspondent could take Harijan children for sight seeing, teach them innocent and even instructive games, could sweep and otherwise keep Harijan quarters clean, could find out cases of
('62', 22, 4, 25, 43987) 1 The letter is not reproduced here.

('62', 23, 4, 10, 44916) MY DEAR CHARLIE, I have your telegram to which I have sent you a reply as follows :
('62', 23, 5, 11, 45000) Your wire.
('62', 23, 5, 12, 45011) Hope Gurudev will be soon restored.
('62', 23, 5, 13, 45047) My love.
('62', 23, 5, 14, 45056) Hales wrote to me suggesting that I should at one proceed to Midnapore and I understand that he has published the letter even without waiting for my reply.
('62', 23, 5, 15, 45212) Here is a copy of my reply 1 to him for your information.
('62', 23, 5, 16, 45270) You know that I am taking all the rest that the doctors have advised and not moving out till the 7th of November.
('62', 23, 5, 17, 45384) My weight has steadily gone forward and blood pressure has steadily decreased.

('62', 24, 3, 5, 45948) 1 And those who read his letter must have been as stupid as he was.
('62', 24, 3, 6, 46016) If such a thing were suspected it would not have been sent away unrevised.
('62', 24, 3, 7, 46091) I intended to write Calcutta and not Delhi.
('62', 24, 3, 8, 46135) 2 I dont even know that anything has been given to Delhi.
('62', 24, 3, 9, 46193) N.s story is a painful one.

('62', 24, 7, 13, 46442) October 14, 1933 Rishi Dayananda 4 was one of the greatest reformers in Hindu ism.
('62', 24, 7, 14, 46525) He stimulated Vedic studies, and fearlessly opposed untoucha bility among other evils.

('62', 24, 8, 16, 46634) 29. TALK WITH A KHADI WORKER 5
('62', 24, 9, 17, 46665) [Before October 15, 1933] We require machinery on a large scale for the industries running on steam power, etc.
('62', 24, 9, 18, 46777) We do not have such machinery at present; we

('62', 24, 11, 22, 47078) 5 This appeared in chandrashankar Shuklas weekly letter under the title  Why the Spinning wheel Only ?.
('62', 25, 0, 1, 47182) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 26
('62', 25, 1, 2, 47223) can get it from other countries only on the terms acceptable to them.
('62', 25, 1, 3, 47293) We would also require experts to run such machines.
('62', 25, 1, 4, 47345) We do not have enough of them either.
('62', 25, 1, 5, 47383) At present, therefore, we shall have to import them from outside.
('62', 25, 1, 6, 47449) Nor do we have the capital required to meet the needs of a population of 30 crores.
('62', 25, 1, 7, 47533) Hence, even if it is possible to be self sufficient through industries run on steam power, etc., it would take a long time.
('62', 25, 1, 8, 47657) Moreover, if this source of tremendous energy is employed on a large scale in the country, it would lead to a great increase in the present unemployment.
('62', 25, 1, 9, 47811) It is said that in America every man gets the work of 36 slaves with the help of gigantic machines.
('62', 25, 1, 10, 47911) This means that with the help of these machines each person does the work of 36 persons.
('62', 25, 1, 11, 48000) If we estimate that the population of India will be 37 crores when it reaches such a stage, it would mean that 36 crores of them would remain unemployed.
('62', 25, 1, 12, 48154) In other words, to enable one crore of people in this country to be as rich as Americans, 36 crores would have to commit suicide, or else a Chenghiz Khan or a Ravana should wipe out 36 crores and distribute the country among the remaining one crore.
('62', 25, 1, 13, 48404) The per capita distribution of land in this country is two or three bighas only.
('62', 25, 1, 14, 48485) This much land is certainly not enough for ones maintenance.
('62', 25, 1, 15, 48546) Everyone, there fore, must have some other occupation at home.
('62', 25, 1, 16, 48609) This is naturally the spinning wheel.
('62', 25, 1, 17, 48647) We require very little capital to make it universal.
('62', 25, 1, 18, 48700) Other requirements would be available in every village.
('62', 25, 1, 19, 48756) All that is necessary is a change of attitude among the people.
('62', 25, 1, 20, 48820) They must shake off their lethargy.
('62', 25, 1, 21, 48856) The solution of the economic problem of Harijans also lies in this.
('62', 25, 1, 22, 48924) If the machine age comes into vogue, all the Harijans would be included among those 36 crores.

('62', 25, 3, 25, 49097) Some idea of the wide repercussions of untouchability can be had from the following letter 1 of Sjt.
('62', 25, 3, 26, 49198) Mulchand Parekh.
('62', 25, 4, 27, 49215) 1 Not translated here.
('62', 25, 4, 28, 49238) The correspondent had described an incident in which a shepherd was considered responsible for bringing about disease and death to cattle because of his association with Harijans and was threatened with ostracism or worse.
('62', 26, 0, 1, 49461) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 27
('62', 26, 1, 2, 49507) Is it any wonder if the cup of sorrow overflows when to such ignorance and resultant superstitions is added the dross of untouch ability?
('62', 26, 1, 3, 49645) There is only one remedy for it and that is that a Harijan worker should tolerantly look upon all these insults as symptoms of the same disease and proceed to find a solution for it.
('62', 26, 1, 4, 49828) He should gain access to the shepherds family, explain things to them with patience and remove their ignorance.
('62', 26, 1, 5, 49940) If any jealous person has taken advan tage of their superstitious nature, he should make a peaceful endea vour to persuade him.
('62', 26, 1, 6, 50068) These experiences suggest that the workers ought to go to the villages and share the peoples lives.
('62', 26, 1, 7, 50168) Moreover, the frightened shepherd needs to be reassured.
('62', 26, 1, 8, 50225) He sould be convinced about the futility of a boycott and he should be made to feel secure with our readiness to protect him in every way.

('62', 26, 3, 11, 50441) SATYAGRAHA ASHRAM, WARDHA, October 15, 1933
('62', 26, 4, 12, 50485) As all the energy that I have been able to regain has been given to the immediate work in hand, I have not been able to write to you.
('62', 26, 4, 13, 50619) There was nothing new I had to say and I knew that you would not misunderstand any action that I took.
('62', 26, 4, 14, 50722) I, therefore, did not send my explanation believing that, if anything I did required explanation, you would not hesitate to demand it of me.
('62', 26, 4, 15, 50863) I have kept myself informed of your health, or rather want of it, and I realized long ago that it was vain to plead with you that you should take this change or that.
('62', 26, 4, 16, 51030) In this as in other matters you are a law unto yourself.
('62', 26, 4, 17, 51087) I do, therefore, satisfy myself with praying that God, who has taken care of you all these long years and who has blessed you with energy of which the youth of India may well be jealous, will continue to take care of you, so long as He needs your services.
('62', 26, 4, 18, 51344) I write this letter with reference to your latest statement.
('62', 26, 4, 19, 51405) My own impression is that the All India Congress Committee, if it meets, will
('62', 27, 0, 1, 51483) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 28
('62', 27, 1, 2, 51524) by an overwhelming majority pass a resolution endorsing continuance of the civil resistance movement.
('62', 27, 1, 3, 51626) That being my conviction, I see no reason for convening a meeting for such a confirmation, because the confirmation will not accelerate the pace of civil resistance.
('62', 27, 1, 4, 51792) It has to take its own natural course.
('62', 27, 1, 5, 51831) But, if you believe that the All India Congress Committee will adopt a new programme and give up civil resistance, there is absolutely no reason whatsoever why you should not actively canvass for a requisition on receipt of which Jawaharlal is bound to convene a meeting.
('62', 27, 1, 6, 52103) And I would venture to submit that if you would promote a requisition you should also in consultation with the requisitionists chalk out a definite policy and programme which you will prosecute unflinchingly.
('62', 27, 1, 7, 52312) If this is not done and a mere requi sition is sent the meeting will simply end in a desultory dis cussion and ill thought out resolutions.
('62', 27, 1, 8, 52452) Whilst I would gladly attend any such meeting and say my say, I am not keen on attending such a meeting and I would gladly refrain from attending it, if my absence was, from the highest motives, desired by you or any body of responsible mem bers.

('62', 29, 3, 4, 54396) DEAR JANAKDHARI BABU, On going through the arrears of my correspondence, I came upon your letter of 28th August last.
('62', 29, 3, 5, 54514) But, before I came upon your letter I was often thinking of you, and only the other day I discussed about you with Jamnalalji.
('62', 29, 3, 6, 54641) Your children are so young that it is very difficult for any insti tution to take them without you and your wife.
('62', 29, 3, 7, 54755) That means you must find something there.
('62', 29, 3, 8, 54797) The first thing is that you must humble yourself and put yourself on a level with the common labourer and bring up your children to become labourers.
('62', 29, 3, 9, 54947) But even labourers should have education.
('62', 29, 3, 10, 54989) That education should be given by you.
('62', 29, 3, 11, 55028) Your wife should also labour.
('62', 29, 3, 12, 55058) If you will accommodate yourself to this life, a great load will be off your mind, which itself would soothe your nerves and much of the dyspepsia would also go under the stimulating effect of the new life, that is, if you take it joyously.
('62', 29, 3, 13, 55299) Unless we who have received a fairly liberal education effect a revolution in our life, we would simply remain parasites that we areliving on the sweat of the famishing peasant.
('62', 29, 3, 14, 55477) You should discuss this matter with Brijkishore Babu and others.
('62', 29, 3, 15, 55542) I would like you to be the pioneer of the new thought and the new movement, and yet it is really not new, for, I gave it currency when I returned to India in 1915, and have been trying to live in accordance with it, however imperfectly I might have done it.
('62', 29, 3, 16, 55800) You have, therefore, to perfect it.

('62', 32, 6, 34, 60407) Be that as it may you were not in the least at fault.
('62', 32, 6, 35, 60461) Still, a public worker like you should show tolerance.
('62', 32, 6, 36, 60516) For the present, I do not feel like writing anything to Gokhale.

('62', 33, 8, 25, 61910) If you think that it must not be sent in and is likely to cause embarrassment, you need not take any action upon it.
('62', 33, 8, 26, 62027) You may then return it with your reasons after you are free from the wedding arrangements.
('62', 33, 8, 27, 62118) If, however, you think that the resignation may be accepted, you may publish it forthwith.

('62', 34, 1, 2, 62487) that the Treasurer can only be appointed by the All India Congress Committee.
('62', 34, 1, 3, 62565) Therefore, the treasurership may remain in Jamnalaljis hands, for the time being.
('62', 34, 1, 4, 62647) The chief thing is that he ceases to be a member of the Working Committee.
('62', 34, 1, 5, 62722) I think that the step is a wise and necessary one.
('62', 34, 1, 6, 62773) Constituted as he is, it is risky for him to seek im prisonment just now, that is, without taking the rest that the specialist considers necessary.
('62', 34, 1, 7, 62921) But, ordinarily, fighters cant consult their health to the extent that Jamnalaljis temperament demands and as he shares the same view of a civil resisters duty that I have, he is ill at ease, so long as he holds a responsible office in the Congress Organization.
('62', 34, 1, 8, 63184) I have given you my reasoning which decided my acceptance of Jamnalaljis proposal to resign.

('62', 34, 6, 12, 63382) WARDHAGANJ, October 17, 1933 I regret to have to inform the public that Shrimati N. dis appeared suddenly from the Wardha Ashram about ten days ago.
('62', 34, 6, 13, 63531) She had of late become more than usually unbalanced.
('62', 34, 6, 14, 63584) All the affec tion that parents, brothers or sisters could show was shown to her, but evi dently her fearful past proved too strong for her.
('62', 34, 6, 15, 63725) It is likely that she is again leading the old thoughtless, untruthful and unclean life.
('62', 34, 6, 16, 63814) I give this information to warn young men against tempting her, or being tempted by her.
('62', 34, 6, 17, 63903) I would like those who may come in contact with her not to give any financial aid.
('62', 34, 6, 18, 63986) She is hardly responsible for her actions, and it would be a deliverance for her, if some philan thropic institution would take charge of her.
('62', 34, 6, 19, 64129) If she sees this notice, I would have her to recall all the promises she made to herself and to me, and in humility to ask God to exorcise the devil that has possessed her.
('62', 34, 6, 20, 64302) She knows that if she asks truly, her prayer will not go in vain.
('62', 34, 6, 21, 64368) She had such experiences in her sane moments.
('62', 34, 6, 22, 64414) She was last heard of in Delhi.

('62', 35, 7, 17, 65338) Jamnalal shields me well from the visitors but who can protect me from letters ?
('62', 35, 7, 18, 65419) Never am I able to clear my desk.
('62', 35, 7, 19, 65453) Because the order of going to bed early has also to be observed.
('62', 35, 7, 20, 65518) I am writing this having got up at 3 a.m.
('62', 35, 7, 21, 65560) The implication is not that this letter is the sole cause for rising early.
('62', 35, 7, 22, 65636) Even during the time allowed in the evening I am prevented from doing anything substantial by the pestering insects.
('62', 35, 7, 23, 65753) I have read your article about Jawaharlal.
('62', 35, 7, 24, 65796) It is good and you have done no harm by writing it.
('62', 35, 7, 25, 65848) There could be no need to suppress our opinions about one another.
('62', 35, 7, 26, 65915) When Truth alone is to be sought, suppression of ones opinion becomes a fault.
('62', 35, 7, 27, 65994) You must have sent the article to Jawaharlal, if not, do so.
('62', 35, 7, 28, 66055) He is a very straightforward man

('62', 36, 1, 3, 66258) I am confident ultimately he is bound to follow the path of Truth.
('62', 36, 1, 4, 66325) And if his line of thinking proves to be correct, comment would be superfluous.
('62', 36, 1, 5, 66405) Equality can never mean uniformity.
('62', 36, 1, 6, 66441) Equality only means uniformity in justice.
('62', 36, 1, 7, 66484) There is no distinction between an atom and the Himalayas in the eyes of God.
('62', 36, 1, 8, 66562) He is the same to the atom as to the Himalayas.
('62', 36, 1, 9, 66610) Gopi left yesterday.
('62', 36, 1, 10, 66631) I could not have a long talk with her but she used to come and sit with me every day.
('62', 36, 1, 11, 66717) She is an extremely simple girl and was very happy here; she mixed with everybody.
('62', 36, 1, 12, 66800) She went to Bombay on account of Diwali.
('62', 36, 1, 13, 66841) She was also keen to see the illumi nations there.
('62', 36, 1, 14, 66892) It will be good if she returns after Diwali.

('62', 37, 4, 5, 68045) WARDHAGANJ October 18, 1933 At the conclusion of the ceremony addressing the couple Gandhiji said that this was an inter provincial marriage and not an inter caste one.
('62', 37, 4, 6, 68214) He had no hesitation in advocating inter caste marriages under well defined limitations, for he believed that there was no varna or division in the original sense of the term and that limiting marriage to the same division or varna was never its distin guishing feature.
('62', 37, 4, 7, 68485) He drew the attention of the couple to the fact that marriage was not intended to indulge in ones passions but to impose a restraint upon them.
('62', 37, 4, 8, 68629) He hoped that both of them would make service of the country their mission in life and then they would find that their joint life would be one of happiness, contentment and increasing self res traint.
('62', 37, 4, 9, 68830) It gave him much pleasure to find that the bride came from an Arya Samajist family.
('62', 37, 4, 10, 68914) His relations with the Arya Samajists, he con tinued, had always been intimate, although they knew that there were honest differences between them.
('62', 37, 4, 11, 69062) This marriage had brought them nearer.

('62', 38, 4, 14, 70202) PANNALAL, It seems your letter has crossed my postcard.
('62', 38, 4, 15, 70258) Your purity has so impressed me that anything you write or any step you take cannot hurt me.
('62', 38, 4, 16, 70351) By that I do not mean that I shall always agree with you on the rightness of your step.
('62', 38, 4, 17, 70439) But the more experience I gain the more I realize that there are as many concep tions of dharma as there are individuals.
('62', 38, 4, 18, 70561) The deeper I delve the grea ter is my comprehension of the dictum of the Gita : Better to die following ones own faith.
('62', 38, 4, 19, 70681) I certainly wish you success in what you have considered your dharma.I personally did wish that when others slackened, you would be able better to understand satyagraha.
('62', 38, 4, 20, 70851) I hold that satyagraha has not yet manifested itself in India in its true form.
('62', 38, 4, 21, 70931) The duty of manifesting it devolves on you and me, that is, the inmates of the Ashram.
('62', 38, 4, 22, 71018) For you, civil disobedience cannot be a political matter.
('62', 38, 4, 23, 71076) It can only be a matter of dharma.
('62', 38, 4, 24, 71111) Dharma reveals itself in its true form only when there is despair all around.
('62', 38, 4, 25, 71189) If we join the crowd in offering prayers, it would not be an indication of our faith.
('62', 38, 4, 26, 71275) But it would in some measure be a test of our faith if when others lost faith in prayer a handful of us continued to offer prayers and derived joy from so doing.
('62', 38, 4, 27, 71437) But what is dharma to me may not be dharma to you.
('62', 38, 4, 28, 71488) Only what you see as dharma will be dharma to you.
('62', 38, 4, 29, 71539) I have only conveyed my views to you as an elder.
('62', 38, 4, 30, 71589) If your reason does not accept it, if it does not appeal to your heart, then do not act on it.
('62', 38, 4, 31, 71684) Individual civil disobedience must
('62', 39, 0, 1, 71719) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 40
('62', 39, 1, 2, 71760) be taken to mean perfection.
('62', 39, 1, 3, 71789) If you are starting a goshala, are you going to do it on your own, or is there any room for suggestions and guidance?
('62', 39, 1, 4, 71907) If there is such scope, meet me.
('62', 39, 1, 5, 71940) I shall then send you my suggestions.
('62', 39, 1, 6, 71978) Do come over if you feel like coming.
('62', 39, 1, 7, 72016) What you write about Gangabehn and Nanibehn seems correct.
('62', 39, 1, 8, 72075) It is your duty to guide the two of them.
('62', 39, 1, 9, 72117) And it is also your right.
('62', 39, 1, 10, 72144) I may or may not be able to write letters.
('62', 39, 1, 11, 72187) But both of them have got to write to me.
('62', 39, 1, 12, 72229) In fact I have been awaiting their letters.
('62', 39, 1, 13, 72273) I hope you yourself are in good health.
('62', 39, 1, 14, 72313) Prabhudass marriage was solemnized yesterday.
('62', 39, 1, 15, 72359) The brides name is Amba.
('62', 39, 1, 16, 72384) She is 24 years old.
('62', 39, 1, 17, 72405) She is competent, and has a deep sense of sacrifice.
('62', 39, 1, 18, 72458) She has been to jail twice.
('62', 39, 1, 19, 72486) She had been trying to come and live in the Ashram for several years but there were restric tions from her guardians.
('62', 39, 1, 20, 72604) Kishorelal and Gomati have gone to Akola today.
('62', 39, 1, 21, 72652) Anandi, Babu and Bachu have gone in that direction today.
('62', 39, 1, 22, 72710) Prabhudas will be staying here for some time.
('62', 39, 1, 23, 72756) Amba is of course with him.
('62', 39, 1, 24, 72784) I am regaining my strength.
('62', 39, 1, 25, 72812) I am gaining weight.
('62', 39, 1, 26, 72833) The blood pressure is going down.
('62', 39, 1, 27, 72867) There are more than forty girls here.
('62', 39, 1, 28, 72905) I have received your second letter.
('62', 39, 1, 29, 72941) I am here till the 7th Nove mber.
('62', 39, 1, 30, 72975) I shall leave on the 8th.

('62', 39, 6, 35, 73089) [After October 18, 1933] 2
('62', 39, 7, 36, 73116) For the poor and those with abstemious habits, the only after meal treat for the mouth is water.
('62', 39, 7, 37, 73213) And so, it is not necessary to offer guests betel nut, etc.
('62', 39, 7, 38, 73273) One should not put ones hand into the cooked foods.
('62', 39, 7, 39, 73325) All of them should be served with a spoon or a ladle.
('62', 39, 7, 40, 73379) If the guest is an Englishman or Englishwoman, we should place a spoon before them without their asking for it.
('62', 39, 7, 41, 73491) It is not necessary to cook many articles of food for guests.
('62', 39, 7, 42, 73553) No special article of food should be cooked for them.
('62', 39, 7, 43, 73607) If, however, we ourselves are
('62', 39, 8, 44, 73637) 1 Gandhiji states at the end of the note that he was sending it for Amba.
('62', 39, 8, 45, 73711) Evidently the note containing these suggestions was written after Prabhudass marriage to Amba on October 18, 1933. 2 ibid

('62', 40, 1, 2, 73879) addicted to pleasures of the palate, on the day when we have a guest, we should take the occasion to cook only a frugal meal, have it ourselves and serve it to the guest, and humbly and gently mention the fact of the meal being frugal so that we may not seem affected.
('62', 40, 1, 3, 74148) We should never let dirt collect in our nails, eyes, ears or nostrils.
('62', 40, 1, 4, 74219) Even if we are not so on the other days, before guests we should always appear clean and keep the children so, for a cultured guest dislikes dirt and feels repugnant to being served food cooked by persons with dirty hands.
('62', 40, 1, 5, 74442) The saree is not meant for removing the dirt with, a handkerchief must be used for the purpose.
('62', 40, 1, 6, 74538) When eating, one must not make smacking sounds, nor talk while eating.
('62', 40, 1, 7, 74609) If children have such a habit, we should make them give it up.
('62', 40, 1, 8, 74672) We should offer a guest something suitable to sit on.
('62', 40, 1, 9, 74726) We should have respect for the guest in our mind.
('62', 40, 1, 10, 74776) If it is there, the guest cannot but see it.
('62', 40, 1, 11, 74821) We should teach the children always to bow to a guest to greet him.
('62', 40, 1, 12, 74889) We should make no distinction between a guest who is an im portant person and one who is not so, or between a guest whom we know personally and one who is a stranger to us.
('62', 40, 1, 13, 75062) Since our aim in the Ahsram is to lead an abstemious life, we should not indulge the palate.
('62', 40, 1, 14, 75155) Since we are not to serve a guest relishing dishes, we should not cook sweets, nor season them with condiments, nor make spicy sauces, nor c cook too many vegetables.
('62', 40, 1, 15, 75322) If we have a number of vege tables with us, we should mix them together and serve them boiled as far as possible.
('62', 40, 1, 16, 75436) We should take care to see that children do no dirty things.
('62', 40, 1, 17, 75497) We should place a clean handkerchief before the guest at the same time as wegive him a jug of water.
('62', 40, 1, 18, 75598) We should tell him where he may wash his hands or help him to wash his hands in a utensil.
('62', 40, 1, 19, 75689) We should not expect a guest to clean the plates he has used for eating but insist on taking them away from him and clean them ourselves.
('62', 40, 1, 20, 75827) We should courteously ask a guest and know from him his needs, and if they are not contrary to our dharma or beyond our means, satisfy them.
('62', 40, 1, 21, 75968) I am sending this note for Amba.

('62', 41, 2, 3, 76143) SATYAGRAHA ASHRAM, WARDHA, October 19/20, 1933 1
('62', 41, 3, 4, 76192) THAKKAR BAPA, Everyday I think of writing you a long letter and it is postponed everyday.
('62', 41, 3, 5, 76282) Jamnalal can help avoid interviews, but who can stem the increasing flow of correspondence ?
('62', 41, 3, 6, 76375) I have got to go to bed early and so some letters do remain unattended piling the heap of papers up.
('62', 41, 3, 7, 76476) I carry on in this pitiful state.
('62', 41, 3, 8, 76510) What should I write about N.?
('62', 41, 3, 9, 76540) I have done my best for her.
('62', 41, 3, 10, 76569) I think she did try honestly to restrain her passions.
('62', 41, 3, 11, 76624) But she slipped during her attempts and ultimately ran away.
('62', 41, 3, 12, 76685) If she drowns herself, I would neither be surprised nor sorry.
('62', 41, 3, 13, 76748) If she is alive, I would not give up hopes for her improvement.
('62', 41, 3, 14, 76812) I do not at all repent having readmitted her.
('62', 41, 3, 15, 76858) It was my duty to do so.
('62', 41, 3, 16, 76883) She was basking in affection not only here but at Sabarmati also.
('62', 41, 3, 17, 76949) She used to write to me that she never experienced such affection even from her parents.
('62', 41, 3, 18, 77038) All were content with whatever little restraint she voluntarily accepted.
('62', 41, 3, 19, 77112) How can one be changed so suddenly, who remained unbridled for several years ?
('62', 41, 3, 20, 77191) I have not yet judged .
('62', 41, 3, 21, 77215) 2 I have never noticed any fault on this part in connection with N. The Agra affair is very sad.
('62', 41, 3, 22, 77312) We reap what we sow.
('62', 41, 3, 23, 77333) Let Hinduism perish if the so called sanatanists fail to wake up and, in their vanity resort to goondaism with the help of the masses.
('62', 41, 3, 24, 77468) It is enough if we continue doing our duty.
('62', 41, 3, 25, 77512) Gods will prevails ultimately.
('62', 41, 3, 26, 77543) The affairs at Samartha and Dholka are not only sad but shameful for us also.
('62', 41, 3, 27, 77621) Similar petty cases take place here too.
('62', 41, 3, 28, 77662) I intend to write something in Harijan about this matter.
('62', 41, 4, 29, 77720) I think it is good that Harijan is shifted to Madras.
('62', 41, 4, 30, 77774) It was the only way to utilize Sastri fully.
('62', 41, 4, 31, 77819) Kodand Rao had arranged a small function in honour of Sastri.
('62', 41, 4, 32, 77881) Deodhar spoke there.
('62', 41, 4, 33, 77902) He hinted at the
('62', 41, 5, 34, 77919) 1 The letter bears the date October 19, 1933, at the end of paragraph 2, but was signed Wardha, 20 11 1993, which appears to be a slip for 20 10 1933.
('62', 41, 5, 35, 78070) The letter was evidently written before Gandhijis tour of the Central Provinces on November 8, 1933. 2 The name has been omitted.

('62', 42, 1, 2, 78269) same thing.
('62', 42, 1, 3, 78281) He said Sastri was withering in Poona and will blossom in Madras.
('62', 42, 1, 4, 78347) Sastri has gained confidence to run Harijan.
('62', 42, 1, 5, 78392) He will get help from some others.
('62', 42, 1, 6, 78427) It will be away from Delhi; but that is no inconvenience.
('62', 42, 1, 7, 78485) The Hindi edition is already based in Delhi.
('62', 42, 1, 8, 78530) If Sastri could not settle in Poona to devote himself fully to Harijan he could do so much less in Delhi.
('62', 42, 1, 9, 78636) His suffering was mental and genuine.
('62', 42, 1, 10, 78674) Since we were to bring out Harijan with the help of Sastri, it was our duty to look to his convenience.
('62', 42, 1, 11, 78778) I shall send you Sastris letter, if I have not destroyed it, which will give you an idea of his mental distress.
('62', 42, 1, 12, 78891) It has always been my opinion that the English edition can be produced best and cheapest from Madras.
('62', 42, 1, 13, 78993) However, you may write to and arrange with Sastri directly in case you and Ghanshyamdas are not fully satisfied with my letter.
('62', 42, 1, 14, 79121) My mention of rest on Sunday and Monday may be considered an oversight.
('62', 42, 1, 15, 79193) You are welcome to include Monday and Tuesday in the programme that you may chalk out.
('62', 42, 1, 16, 79280) Tour programme for C. P. will be completed within the time prescribed by you.
('62', 42, 1, 17, 79358) Dr. Khare has already issued the tour programme for C. P. (Marathi).
('62', 42, 1, 18, 79427) You may have seen it.
('62', 42, 1, 19, 79449) He wished to write to you also.
('62', 42, 1, 20, 79481) Satisbabu has written from Bengal.
('62', 42, 1, 21, 79516) He has also written to you.

('62', 42, 4, 25, 79717) DEAR FRIEND, I am able this time to send you by return [of post] my reply to your letter of 18th inst.
('62', 42, 4, 26, 79820) I have no such modesty as you attribute to me.
('62', 42, 4, 27, 79867) I meant literally what I said about my limitations.
('62', 42, 4, 28, 79919) They are abvious.
('62', 42, 4, 29, 79937) I am dying to co operate with anybody and everybody and certainly with the Govern ment in restoring peace that is living and real, not the peace of the grave.
('62', 42, 4, 30, 80096) A living peace cannot be and will never be brought about at the point of the bayonet.

('62', 43, 1, 3, 80477) I can be no party to any such plan.
('62', 43, 1, 4, 80513) And I should despair of proving my sincerity about non violence, if it requires further proof after my having lived a life of non violence in the face of circumstances often most provoking, for an unbroken period of 40 years and more.
('62', 43, 1, 5, 80748) As to your suggestion about an All Parties meeting 1, judged by the accepted standard I have proved a hopeless failure, as witness1 my last performance at such a meeting 2 convened for the purpose of achieving a communal settlement.
('62', 43, 1, 6, 80981) I was no less a failure at the 3 various meetings that we held in India for similar purposes.

('62', 43, 6, 12, 81232) I do not know whether you had sent copies to my two partners.
('62', 43, 6, 13, 81294) Anyway I have posted it on to Andrews.
('62', 43, 6, 14, 81333) You thought that we were all at the same place.
('62', 43, 6, 15, 81381) But just at present we are not.
('62', 43, 6, 16, 81413) Your work in Geneva was great.
('62', 43, 6, 17, 81444) And I know wherever you are you can give a good account of yourself.
('62', 43, 6, 18, 81513) But I retain the same opinion that I have you some time ago that if you came as a delegate your expenses should be found by your constituency.
('62', 43, 6, 19, 81656) But if you come for the purpose of seeing things first hand, your expenses can be found from here.
('62', 43, 6, 20, 81755) Whether it is worthwhile your coming for that special purpose is solely for you to decide.
('62', 43, 6, 21, 81846) If you feel the need you should come.
('62', 43, 6, 22, 81884) If you are a good sailor you can certainly come in the 3rd class without the slightest difficulty and see more of life, because you see more of common humanity as a 3rd class passenger than as a saloon passenger.
('62', 43, 6, 23, 82097) That is my own experience and that of others who have travelled in all classes.

('62', 44, 1, 3, 82569) I entirely agree with you that what he does not know of Bengal is not worth knowing and I know also that he can render the greatest help in the restoration of peace, but his difficulty would be the same as mine.
('62', 44, 1, 4, 82781) I send you a copy of another letter 1 which I am obliged to write to Mr. Hales.
('62', 44, 1, 5, 82861) The fact is that the Government demand co operation on their own terms, which nobody freely gives and which no self respecting man can ever give.

('62', 44, 6, 13, 83271) I again advise you to remember that life is well governed by observing rules.

('62', 45, 3, 10, 84303) If it is necessary to write to anyone, I will do so.
('62', 45, 3, 11, 84356) I take it you will be publishing reports in the Press from time to time.
('62', 45, 3, 12, 84429) There is no alternative but to guide Kamaladevi.
('62', 45, 3, 13, 84478) One cannot go by rumours.
('62', 45, 3, 14, 84504) I asked her many frank questions.
('62', 45, 3, 15, 84538) But she only de clares her innocence.
('62', 45, 3, 16, 84576) I am not trying to stop the divorce.
('62', 45, 3, 17, 84613) It has become necessary.
('62', 45, 3, 18, 84638) The wedding of Prabhudas took place the day before yester day.
('62', 45, 3, 19, 84701) I am enclosing Thakkar Bapas letter.
('62', 45, 3, 20, 84738) You can see how guile less he was in his previous letter.
('62', 45, 3, 21, 84796) He was not at all at fault in what he wrote.
('62', 45, 3, 22, 84841) I have heard many complaints about your temper.
('62', 45, 3, 23, 84889) But I have always defended you.
('62', 45, 3, 24, 84921) You should remove the cause for com plaint.
('62', 45, 3, 25, 84965) Forgive Kodanda Rao 1 for his jest and write a nice letter to Thakkar Bapa.Caesaers wife must be above suspicion does not mean that Caesaers wife may never be suspected.
('62', 45, 3, 26, 85135) What it means is that C.s wife should never give cause for suspicion, and if she is even then sus pected, she can afford to remain unconcerned about criticism.
('62', 45, 3, 27, 85295) It is in mans hands to remain pure.
('62', 45, 3, 28, 85331) That others should consider him pure is in nobodys hands.
('62', 45, 3, 29, 85389) Do you know that there are many in the world who find fault with Gods creation?
('62', 45, 3, 30, 85469) Taramati and the child will be doing well.
('62', 45, 3, 31, 85512) Today is the New Year day.
('62', 45, 3, 32, 85539) May it bring good to you all, that is to say, may the country received greater services from you.

('62', 46, 4, 9, 86015) WARDHA, October 20, 1933
('62', 46, 5, 10, 86040) CHHAGANLAL AND KASHI, I received your postcard.
('62', 46, 5, 11, 86088) You must have received my telegram sent after the wedding ceremony was over.
('62', 46, 5, 12, 86165) I can see from your postcard that you have been worrying.
('62', 46, 5, 13, 86223) Kashis wish was fully respected.
('62', 46, 5, 14, 86256) Lakshmibehn sang the womens prayer 1 with the utmost devotion, beginning with the shloka Shantakaram 2. After the cere mony was over, she also sang the bhajan 3 Vaishnava Jana.
('62', 46, 5, 15, 86433) In Amba, Prabhudas has got exactly the kind of girl suitable for him.
('62', 46, 5, 16, 86503) She seems to me to have a transparently sincere nature.
('62', 46, 5, 17, 86559) Brave of course she is.
('62', 46, 5, 18, 86583) She has twice been to jail and has been yearning for a long time to live in the Ashram.
('62', 46, 5, 19, 86671) She does not seem to love overmuch any kind of pleasure.
('62', 46, 5, 20, 86728) She wore no bangles at all at the time of the wedding ceremony.
('62', 46, 5, 21, 86792) After the ceremony was over, Janakibehn put glass bangles on her wrists.
('62', 46, 5, 22, 86865) Very likely she will break even these in a short while.
('62', 46, 5, 23, 86921) Probably you do not know that in the North it is usually customary to wear bangles or put the auspicious red mark on the forehead.
('62', 46, 5, 24, 87052) It is customary for the bride, after a particular ceremony is over, to wear the garments offered by the father in laws family.
('62', 46, 5, 25, 87179) I had three saris ready with me.
('62', 46, 5, 26, 87212) One was got woven by Janakibehn, the other was sent by Santok and the third by Gomati.
('62', 46, 5, 27, 87299) The sari sent by the last was woven from yarn spun by Kishorelal and Gomati themselves.
('62', 46, 5, 28, 87387) Gomati happened to have it with her by chance and so sent it to me and insisted that I should give that very sari to Amba to wear.
('62', 46, 5, 29, 87518) I too liked the idea.
('62', 46, 5, 30, 87540) But was Amba the kind of girl to accept it?
('62', 46, 5, 31, 87584) She said: How would I be the better for it.
('62', 46, 5, 32, 87628) What I am wearing is goodenough.Please let it be.
('62', 46, 5, 33, 87678) I found all this so pleasing and natural

('62', 47, 1, 2, 87832) that I did not at all insist on her accepting the saree.
('62', 47, 1, 3, 87889) She then wore, during the wedding ceremony, the sari sent by her parents.
('62', 47, 1, 4, 87963) She had some fever during the ceremony.
('62', 47, 1, 5, 88003) She had been forbidden to take anything except fruit on the wedding day.
('62', 47, 1, 6, 88076) The fever came down in the evening.
('62', 47, 1, 7, 88112) She passed the whole of yesterday on fruit and milk only.
('62', 47, 1, 8, 88170) She is now able to move about and is quite happy.
('62', 47, 1, 9, 88220) For the present, she will stay here.
('62', 47, 1, 10, 88257) A sari was made for Ba from yarn spun by me.
('62', 47, 1, 11, 88302) It was neither washed nor dyed.
('62', 47, 1, 12, 88334) I gave Amba that sari also.
('62', 47, 1, 13, 88362) A piece of rejo 1 or kokali 2 khadi with fine needlework on it given by Ba and Mithubehn for Jakir has also been given to Amba.
('62', 47, 1, 14, 88490) Amba has thus come into possession of a fairly good number of articles.
('62', 47, 1, 15, 88562) For the present, both wish to stay here.
('62', 47, 1, 16, 88603) Afterwards, they will come to you for your blessings.
('62', 47, 1, 17, 88657) My previous letter was not written to rebuke you.
('62', 47, 1, 18, 88707) It was written to make your dharma clear to you and to strengthen your faith.

('62', 47, 4, 22, 88874) 56. AN M.A. IN A HURRY
('62', 47, 5, 23, 88897) An M. A. of Kerala writes a long letter from which I take the following paragraphs 4 of public importance : I can heartily endorse my correspondents statement that there can be no peace for me or him and his friends, if untouchability con tinues in our country.
('62', 47, 5, 24, 89159) My word also stands.
('62', 47, 5, 25, 89180) But untouchability will not be removed by force or, which is perhaps the same thing, by law, not will temples be opened by such means.
('62', 47, 5, 26, 89315) Legislation is badly re quired to remove legal obstruction which has been created by certain judicial decisions.
('62', 47, 5, 27, 89428) But if and when the two Bills are passed, untou chability lurking in the Hindu heart will not necessarily be removed
('62', 47, 6, 28, 89545) 1 Coarse silk for making blouse 2 A variety of khadi 3 This and the subscription is in Gandhijis own hand.
('62', 47, 6, 29, 89652) 4 Not reproduced here.
('62', 47, 6, 30, 89675) The correspondent had written about the continuing evil of utouchabilty, indifference of khadi workers towards Harijan work and villagers attitude towards Harijans, and suggested steps to instil courage, self confidence, etc., into Harijans.
('62', 48, 0, 1, 89917) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 49
('62', 48, 1, 2, 89963) nor will public temples be automatically opened.
('62', 48, 1, 3, 90012) Untouchability will go when the Hindu heart has melted, and the public temples will be opened when the worshippers have discovered that God is no res pector of persons and that He does not reside in temples which mans insolence or ignorance has closed against any body of persons who are desirous of offering worship on the same terms as they.
('62', 48, 1, 4, 90356) The correspondent would throw the sole responsibility for opening the Guruvayur temple on me.
('62', 48, 1, 5, 90450) He should know that it is no one mans work.
('62', 48, 1, 6, 90494) It will be done in Gods good time.
('62', 48, 1, 7, 90529) Workers can but work to the best of their ability.
('62', 48, 1, 8, 90580) Let him also know that Kelappans pledge is not exhausted.
('62', 48, 1, 9, 90638) His visit to Colombo is temporary.
('62', 48, 1, 10, 90673) Rajagopalachari works by prayer even though he is in prison.
('62', 48, 1, 11, 90734) Mad havan Nair, that great and true Kerala servant, is no more.
('62', 48, 1, 12, 90798) But I have no doubt that his spirit watches over our conduct and misconduct.
('62', 48, 1, 13, 90875) It will not rest till Hinduism is purified of the evil of untouchability.
('62', 48, 1, 14, 90949) And the correspondent may rest assured that, when the proper time comes and if God wills it, both Kelappan and I would again stake our lives for the opening, not only of the Guruvayur temple, but many others.
('62', 48, 1, 15, 91158) As to the khadi service, the correspondents complaint is wholly unjustified.
('62', 48, 1, 16, 91235) Those who are engaged in khadi service may not very well be expected to give their time to Harijan service.
('62', 48, 1, 17, 91343) But I know that the vast majority of them have no untouchability in their breasts and that they never miss an opportunity of rendering whatever personal service they can to Harijans.
('62', 48, 1, 18, 91526) There is no bar to taking Harijans in Khadi service.
('62', 48, 1, 19, 91579) Lastly I may state that several thousand Harijan families are being supported through the khadi organizations dotted over the whole country.
('62', 48, 1, 20, 91720) The correspondent is on surer ground in his complaints about villagers attitude in many parts of India.
('62', 48, 1, 21, 91824) The ignorance of the villa gers is colossal.
('62', 48, 1, 22, 91869) They are wedded to the idea of high and low.
('62', 48, 1, 23, 91914) Village workers are far too few for the numerous villages.
('62', 48, 1, 24, 91973) But there is no cause whatever for despair.
('62', 48, 1, 25, 92017) Villagers are waking up.
('62', 48, 1, 26, 92042) They have begun to realize that to deny to fellow beings the same status that they have for themselves is to deny Gods equal justice.
('62', 48, 1, 27, 92176) The correspondent has no notion of the silent but solid work that many workers are doing in and around villages.
('62', 48, 1, 28, 92289) This Harijan work being purely religious does not lend itself much to the spectacular.
('62', 48, 1, 29, 92376) It will prosper in exact proportion to the purity and penance of the workers.
('62', 48, 1, 30, 92454) It will be surely
('62', 49, 0, 1, 92472) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 50
('62', 49, 1, 2, 92513) retarded by the impurity, selfishness or mixed motives of workers.
('62', 49, 1, 3, 92580) As to putting life into Harijans, it will be there immediately the crushing dead weight of untouchability is lifted from off the heads of Harijans.
('62', 49, 1, 4, 92728) They should, of course, have, as they are having, religious and other instruction in the many schools that have been and are being opened.
('62', 49, 1, 5, 92867) Time is on our side and so is the time spirit.
('62', 49, 1, 6, 92914) No religion can possibly stand the blazing light of the worlds opinion that is being directed towards all religions, and still retain in it proved evils and superstitions.

('62', 49, 2, 8, 93106) 57. WHAT OF SWEEPERS IF .
('62', 49, 3, 9, 93132) An English friend referring to two ladies who are coming to India writes : 1
('62', 49, 4, 10, 93209) want to do their own sweeper work, even though it may get them into trouble with some of the local caste Hindus .
('62', 49, 4, 11, 93323) it may get them into difficulties with the local sweepers, who will complain .
('62', 49, 4, 12, 93402) that they are losing good work, and good wages.
('62', 49, 4, 13, 93450) Now, what is the right reply to that ?
('62', 49, 4, 14, 93489) Supposing that thousand of millions of caste Hindus and others, up and down India, resolved to do their own sweeping, as an act of penance and visible proof that they felt themselves no better than sweepers, many sweepers would lose their livelihood .
('62', 49, 4, 15, 93741) It is to some extent the old story (in a different form) of the displacement of labour as a result of social development.
('62', 49, 4, 16, 93863) I dont remember seeing any comment of yours or anyones on this point in Harijan .
('62', 49, 4, 17, 93945) It is quite true that I have not discussed this question in these pages as a difficulty, as it has never arisen that way as yet.
('62', 49, 4, 18, 94074) In several places, including the late Ashram at Sabarmati and its branch at Wardha, the inmates have been doing their own sweeper work without the local sweepers being ruffled.
('62', 49, 4, 19, 94251) At Sabarmati, in the beginning stages, we had sweepers, who were paid a paltry sum.
('62', 49, 4, 20, 94335) It was not possi ble to pay them more for about two hours work which at best was never satisfactorily done.
('62', 49, 4, 21, 94443) They did not know the hygienic method.
('62', 49, 4, 22, 94482) They would not easily take to it Sanitary service is by no means a hereditary occupation of long standing.
('62', 49, 4, 23, 94589) All the evidence hitherto collected by me goes to show that before the Mohammedan conquest there were no professional sweepers; the Hindu social system, being based on rural conditions, did not necessitate such sanitary service as
('62', 49, 5, 24, 94820) 1 Only excerpts are reproduced here.
('62', 50, 0, 1, 94857) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 51
('62', 50, 1, 2, 94903) is indispensable in these days of rapid urban growth.
('62', 50, 1, 3, 94957) I do not, however, wish to convey the meaning that rural sanitation during the purely Hindu period was by any means perfect or even fairly satis factory.
('62', 50, 1, 4, 95111) On the contrary, it seems to have been very crude.
('62', 50, 1, 5, 95162) The highly scientific methods evolved and still being developed in the West are undoubtedly a recent and very beneficial growth.
('62', 50, 1, 6, 95291) Holding these views, I can only welcome the determination of the two English sisters to do their own sweeper work.
('62', 50, 1, 7, 95406) If I were in their place, I should invite the sweepers in the neighbourhood to give other service, if they were in want of employment, or to learn the hygienic and clean method of doing sanitary work if they were minded so to do.
('62', 50, 1, 8, 95636) Whether they took up some other work or no, whether they volunteered to learn better methods of sanitation or no, they could not harbour any feeling of being wronged for not being asked to do sanitary service for the sisters, for I would expect them to work for the betterment of Harijans in a hundred ways.
('62', 50, 1, 9, 95944) The difficulty can only, and must always, arise when things are done in a patronizing or selfish manner.
('62', 50, 1, 10, 96049) I would, for instance, be patronizing, if I offered now and then to work a little in a touch me not fashion, side by side with my sweeper, just in order to be able to declare at public meetings that even I did sweeping alongside my sweeper.
('62', 50, 1, 11, 96290) I would be acting selfishly if I did my own sweeping for the sake of keeping my closets cleaner than they would otherwise be and did not want to waste my time in teaching my sweeper the modern method or did not want to pay more for more efficient and more intelligent service.
('62', 50, 1, 12, 96567) But there never can be any offence taken when I serve my sweeper neighbours in a variety of ways and, by doing my own sweeping, teach them by example that sanitary service is not only not a mean occupation, but a perfectly honourable and most useful occupation which everyone should learn and many may follow with great benefit to society, if it is taken up in a humanitarian spirit.

('62', 52, 7, 9, 99152) BHAI VALLABHBHAI, I got your letter.
('62', 52, 7, 10, 99189) I am doing what you wish.
('62', 52, 7, 11, 99215) There will be no moral difficulty.
('62', 52, 7, 12, 99250) I should like you to stop worrying.
('62', 52, 7, 13, 99286) 1 You must have a telescope more powerful than even Premlilabehns.
('62', 52, 7, 14, 99353) Through hers a mustard seed will appear as big as a mountain.

('62', 52, 7, 16, 99454) Prabhudass marriage took place on Wednesday.
('62', 52, 7, 17, 99499) He got a girl exactly of the type that he wanted, and through his own efforts.
('62', 52, 7, 18, 99578) She is 24 and is thoroughly simple in habits.
('62', 52, 7, 19, 99624) Since she is from North India, she cares neither for the vermilion mark nor for bangles.
('62', 52, 7, 20, 99713) She wasnt wearing bangles even during the marriage ceremony.
('62', 52, 7, 21, 99774) Janakibehn has forced bangles on her wrists now.
('62', 52, 7, 22, 99823) She is fairly well educated.
('62', 52, 7, 23, 99852) She is an Arya Samajist.
('62', 52, 7, 24, 99877) I had a long letter from Mahadev (written from Belgaum Jail).
('62', 52, 7, 25, 99939) It is like a long poem.
('62', 52, 7, 26, 99963) I send with this a few extracts from it.
('62', 52, 7, 27, 100004) Brijkishan 3 got ill after going to Delhi.
('62', 52, 7, 28, 100047) Ba is getting ready [for courting imprisonment].

('62', 53, 1, 5, 100763) And in this case the mother is a person like me.

('62', 55, 9, 12, 103531) I cannot postpone doing so any longer, and so I write this.
('62', 55, 9, 13, 103591) I hope Vanamala and Mohan have completely recovered now.
('62', 55, 9, 14, 103648) I would advise you not to keep either of them in Kathlal.
('62', 55, 9, 15, 103706) There was a letter from Narahari specially about them, and he also says that both of them must live with Anandi.
('62', 55, 9, 16, 103819) It is desirable that they should get used to living with other people and have some experience.
('62', 55, 9, 17, 103915) They will fall ill occasionally, no matter where they are.
('62', 55, 9, 18, 103974) Of course if neither of them can be persuaded to go, I shall be helpless.
('62', 55, 9, 19, 104048) But I think you should try and see if you can persuade them to go.
('62', 55, 9, 20, 104115) So far as I know, Vanamala used to feel very happy with Anandi, but it is possible that Mohan may find it difficult to forget his attachment for Kathlal.
('62', 55, 9, 21, 104269) But he has a simple heart and I think it will be easy for you to persuade him.
('62', 55, 9, 22, 104348) If you have recently got any news about Narahari and Mani 1 , please let me know.

('62', 56, 8, 15, 105306) So there is nothing to say about their studies.
('62', 56, 8, 16, 105354) I find that the girls do not get proper food.
('62', 56, 8, 17, 105400) They cannot be fed differently from the Harijan girls.
('62', 56, 8, 18, 105455) Talk to them and if necessary make changes in the menu without increasing the expenditure.
('62', 56, 8, 19, 105546) I believe that the Harijan girls should get the same food as we normally eat.
('62', 56, 8, 20, 105624) I know it is difficult.
('62', 56, 8, 21, 105648) We can think about it only when we meet.
('62', 56, 8, 22, 105689) I have just told you of the girls attitude.
('62', 56, 8, 23, 105733) We should do whatever is possible without doing harm to the Harijan Ashram.

('62', 56, 11, 27, 105930) Q. Inspite of efforts on the part of social reformers, the standard of living of educated communities in Sind has been rising very rapidly; what would you advise under the circumsatnces ?
('62', 56, 12, 28, 106118) 1 Vimala, daughter of Chhaganlal Joshi 2 The report was released to the Press from Hyderabad (Sind) on this date.
('62', 57, 0, 1, 106232) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 58
('62', 57, 1, 2, 106273) A. I would advise those who think this is wrong to set an example by living simply and thinking and acting nobly.
('62', 57, 2, 3, 106387) Q. Young men believe that unless they are in a position to earn from Rs. 150 to 200 per month, they cannot even think of marriage.
('62', 57, 2, 4, 106518) At the same time, an ever in creasing number of them keep on imagining that it is legitimate to satisfy sexual instinct in some way or another without undertaking the obligations of married life; how do you view such a mentality ?
('62', 57, 3, 5, 106749) A. I can only look upon it with shame and deep regret.
('62', 57, 3, 6, 106804) Such mentality can only lead to suicide.
('62', 57, 3, 7, 106845) The only cure for it is for young men, who realize te enormity of the evil, to set their faces against it by showing the greatest purity in their own lives and correctness of conduct.
('62', 57, 4, 8, 107029) Q. What advice would you give to young girls who have perforce to remain unmarried or who are not in a mood to marry ?
('62', 57, 5, 9, 107148) A. Such girls should go out of their little communities or even Provinces in search of suitable deserving companions.
('62', 57, 5, 10, 107266) The sooner we get through the spirit of provincialism and exclusive caste, the better would it be for us.
('62', 57, 5, 11, 107372) I cannot understand why an educated Amil should be in search of an Amil companion and why he or she should not take a deserving companion from any part of India, the condition being, not selfish gratification of base animal passions, but search after spiri tual growth and national advancement.
('62', 57, 6, 12, 107667) Q. Would you not advise the Amil girls to break the barriers of Amilism and be prepared to marry any non Amilbe he a Bhaibund or a Bhatia or any other ?
('62', 57, 6, 13, 107820) What are your views on inter marriages between Sindhis and Gujaratis, etc.
('62', 57, 7, 14, 107895) A. Already answered above.
('62', 57, 8, 15, 107922) Q. If you hold that man and woman should be given fullest opportunity for self expression, would you advise that young girls and young boys should be given unfettered discretion in mixing or associating with each other, irrespective of parents knowledge or control ?
('62', 57, 8, 16, 108189) Also, should girls be allowed to move about as freely as boys do?
('62', 57, 9, 17, 108255) A. Most decidedly not.
('62', 57, 9, 18, 108278) I believe in the middle path.
('62', 57, 9, 19, 108308) Most boys and girls should be guided and allow themselves to be guided by their parents and guardians and the latter on their part should cherish and promote the independence of their boys and girls who may be under their guardianship or supervision.
('62', 57, 9, 20, 108559) If the youth of the country will remain pure they should avoid all secretiveness.
('62', 57, 10, 21, 108641) Q. It is maintained by the old people that in view of the peculiar conditions obtaining in Sind, it is not safe to discard purdah, but young men are naturally

('62', 58, 1, 2, 108846) against this system which they regard as highly pernicious.
('62', 58, 1, 3, 108906) What would you suggest
('62', 58, 2, 4, 108929) to avoid the clash on this point of difference between the young and the old ?
('62', 58, 2, 5, 109008) A. I have never believed in the purdah system.
('62', 58, 2, 6, 109055) I think it is fast going and the girls, who dare to tear the purdah and demonstrate to their neighbours that no harm has befallen them in any way whatever, will be most potent proofs for removing the prejudice or fear.
('62', 58, 2, 7, 109274) Tearing down the purdah does not mean that girls should wander about anywhere and everywhere.
('62', 58, 2, 8, 109368) It is the hiding of one face in the presence of men which I consider to be so highly injurious to ones growth or self expression.
('62', 58, 2, 9, 109498) Modesty is the best protection and purdah.
('62', 58, 3, 10, 109541) Q. What are your views on co education ?
('62', 58, 4, 11, 109582) A. I believe in well regulated and well thought out co education.
('62', 58, 4, 12, 109648) The Bombay Chronicle, 26 10 1933
('62', 58, 5, 13, 109681) 70. TALK WITH A FRIEND 1
('62', 58, 6, 14, 109706) [Before October 22, 1933] You are aware of the agreement 2 among the so called minority communities when the Round Table Conference was in progress in London.
('62', 58, 6, 15, 109865) The Harijans also were included among them.
('62', 58, 6, 16, 109909) I staked my life for them at that time.
('62', 58, 6, 17, 109949) 3 Being a far sighted man I realized that since some sort of a constitution was coming, if the Government acce pted the scheme contained in that agreement our relations with Harijans would come to an end and Hindu society would be perma nently divided.
('62', 58, 6, 18, 110202) Harijans would either separate from the rest of the Hindus and form a new community; or would merge in some other community; but they would not continue to belong to the Hindu fold.
('62', 58, 6, 19, 110384) I saw that this would mean the destruction of Hinduism.
('62', 58, 6, 20, 110440) It would be destroyed not because 60 million people would have left it, but because of the reasons driving them to that course.
('62', 58, 6, 21, 110568) Anyone is free to abandon Hinduism if he so chooses, but we, the caste Hindus, should not be the cause of their doing so.
('62', 58, 6, 22, 110690) I, therefore, felt that it was my dharma to prevent such a division even at the cost of my life.
('62', 58, 6, 23, 110787) Though I was in jail when the Award of the British Cabinet
('62', 58, 7, 24, 110846) 1 This and the following item are from Chandrashanker Shuklas weekly letter.

('62', 59, 1, 2, 111126) regar ding electorates was published, 1 I still felt that I had no choice but to keep my pledge to oppose it.
('62', 59, 1, 3, 111236) I, therefore, went on a fast unto death in September 1932. People say now that, even if only inciden tally, it rendered a great service to Hinduism.
('62', 59, 1, 4, 111385) If you believe that I had taken the right step in opposing the British Cabinets Award, all the other steps follow logically from it.
('62', 59, 2, 5, 111518) Q. Will you kindly explain that in more detail ?
('62', 59, 2, 6, 111567) By your fast in 1932 you did
('62', 59, 3, 7, 111596) succeed in getting the scheme of separate electorates for Harijans altered, but what
('62', 59, 4, 8, 111681) was the justification of the other steps ?
('62', 59, 5, 9, 111724) A. The desire to get the Cabinet Award amended was merely the originating cause of the fast.
('62', 59, 5, 10, 111817) But with its amendment a duty devolved on the caste Hindus.
('62', 59, 5, 11, 111877) Hence, when Sir Purushottamdas 1 and Sjt.
('62', 59, 5, 12, 111919) Ghan shyamdas visited me in jail, I told them that I would not be content merely with the amendment of the Cabinet Award and that the caste Hindus would have to do a great deal.
('62', 59, 5, 13, 112097) Then I embodied this in the form of a resolution.
('62', 59, 5, 14, 112147) It was passed at the Bombay Conference on Sep tember the 25th in almost the very words of my draft.
('62', 59, 5, 15, 112247) 3 It was stated therein that from then on no one would be regarded as an untouc hable in Hinduism and that all temples and other public places would be accessible to Harijans to the same extent that they were to the other Hindus.
('62', 59, 5, 16, 112477) When all the leaders came to me after the Resolution was passed, I pledged my life to the Harijan leaders for the implemen tation of the Resolution.
('62', 59, 5, 17, 112626) Hence it became incumbent upon me to take steps even in Yeravda jail.
('62', 59, 5, 18, 112696) I corresponded with the Govern ment to get the doors of the prison that had closed after that fast opened again, and told it that I would have to keep the caste Hindus awake to their duty, and that, therefore, I should not lose contact with them.
('62', 59, 5, 19, 112943) As a result of the correspondence, the Government granted me full per mission to carry on Harijan work from prison.
('62', 59, 5, 20, 113059) 4 Then I noticed some impurity among the Harijan workers and in consequence I had to resort to the 21 days fast.
('62', 59, 5, 21, 113172) Then I was imprisoned again in August and asked for the same facilities as before.
('62', 59, 5, 22, 113255) On their being refused, there followed another fast of 8 days.
('62', 59, 6, 23, 113318) Q. Can you say more about this impurity among the workers ?

('62', 60, 1, 2, 113665) A. That fast was intended for the purification of the workers.
('62', 60, 1, 3, 113728) I have given an illustration in Harijan to show when a purificatory fast becomes necessary.
('62', 60, 1, 4, 113820) 1 Please refer to it.
('62', 60, 1, 5, 113842) If such impurity creeps into us, religious reform would not spread among the crores of people and the irreligious practice of untouchability which has entered deep into our villages cannot be eradicated.
('62', 60, 1, 6, 114046) I have already described the great conflict in my heart and the terrible storm through which I had to pass before arriving at the decision to fast.
('62', 60, 1, 7, 114194) I have not cited in Harijan all the instances of impurity that have come to my notice.
('62', 60, 1, 8, 114281) I came to know a great many other things during and even after my fast.
('62', 60, 1, 9, 114353) Many of the workers woke up and told me that they had considered themselves absolutely pure that they could not see the blemishes in them.
('62', 60, 1, 10, 114492) I have already published the confession 2 of an overseer who had collected a pice each from the labourers.
('62', 60, 1, 11, 114599) If I were to publish all such instances the pages of Harijan would start stinking.
('62', 60, 1, 12, 114682) I have, therefore, refrained from doing so.
('62', 60, 1, 13, 114726) We need not worry about purifying the world.
('62', 60, 1, 14, 114771) But we can certainly except that those who have dedicated their lives to Harijan work will always remain pure.
('62', 60, 1, 15, 114882) Fasting is a very common thing in Hinduism,but other religions too have recommended fasting as a means for purification.
('62', 60, 2, 16, 115003) Q. Many people feel that your efforts to get the Temple entry Bill 3 passed in
('62', 60, 3, 17, 115082) the Assembly and sending Rajaji to Delhi with that aim was a violation of the
('62', 60, 4, 18, 115160) principle of non co operation.
('62', 60, 4, 19, 115191) Will you kindly explain your point of view ?
('62', 60, 5, 20, 115236) A. The Congress principles are intended to facilitate its work.
('62', 60, 5, 21, 115300) You know that in 1921 when the non co operation movement was in full swing a Congressman in Utkal had misappropriated some money, thinking that he would not be taken to a court of law since the Con gress had boycotted them.
('62', 60, 5, 22, 115524) When this thing was brought to my notice.
('62', 60, 5, 23, 115566) I wired advising that they should have the man arrested.
('62', 60, 5, 24, 115623) The rules of the Congress should not be such that defeat its own aims.
('62', 60, 5, 25, 115694) In the matter of temple entry, I saw that there was a legal impediment, and that if we could not proceed further without getting it removed, we must do so, and bear with any short sighted person who may see a contradiction in our action.
('62', 60, 5, 26, 115932) Is there no difference between taking one grain of

('62', 61, 1, 3, 116271) Medicine should be used to cure a disease and not to commit suicide.
('62', 61, 1, 4, 116340) It is the moral duty of those who passed the Bombay Resolution to take the help of the law, if necessary, to get the disabilities of Harijans removed.
('62', 61, 1, 5, 116491) This is clearly stated in the Resolution.
('62', 61, 1, 6, 116533) How can the supporters of that Resolution oppoe this Bill ?
('62', 61, 1, 7, 116593) Or, why should they hesitate to take the help of members of the Assembly ?
('62', 61, 1, 8, 116668) We have not given but accepted co operation.
('62', 61, 1, 9, 116713) Supposing that the Government passes legislation enforcing complete prohi bition; shall we say then that we do not want it ?

('62', 61, 5, 13, 116905) [Before October 22, 1933] To say that Harijans will not be able to use their franchise pro perly and will not be able to understand the interests of the country is to lay the axe at the very root of the principles of democracy.
('62', 61, 5, 14, 117133) It is like the imperialists telling us that we are not fit for democracy and will never learn the proper use of the franchise.
('62', 61, 5, 15, 117260) Mistakes will always be made.
('62', 61, 5, 16, 117290) We shall progress only through mistakes.
('62', 61, 5, 17, 117331) But does it mean that we should not have the right to vote ?
('62', 61, 5, 18, 117392) Exercise of the right of voting will in itself be an education for Harijans.
('62', 61, 5, 19, 117469) Nor would it be proper to say that they would not under stand national interests.
('62', 61, 5, 20, 117551) Their repre sentatives would be persons elected with our own votes.
('62', 61, 5, 21, 117619) For every Harijan seat, Harijans would elect four persons, and from among these four we shall have to elect one.
('62', 61, 5, 22, 117732) Would we not find even one person from among them who would understand the nations interests ?
('62', 61, 5, 23, 117827) If we really do not find such a person, then the fault would be ours for having neglected them to that extent.
('62', 61, 5, 24, 117938) The right way is to embrace them and win over their hearts by serving them.
('62', 61, 5, 25, 118014) It wont help to distrust them.

('62', 62, 2, 3, 118272) [Before October 22, 1933] UNDYING MEMORY OF THE BELOVED 2
('62', 62, 3, 4, 118330) I fully share your grief.
('62', 62, 3, 5, 118356) Your letter reminds me that several friends of mine have been in the same condition as you.
('62', 62, 3, 6, 118448) But I have seen from experience that our love for the beloved one is not for his or her body but the immortal spirit dwelling in it.
('62', 62, 3, 7, 118581) As the years pass, your memory of your wife will not grow dim in your heart, but will become stronger and richer.
('62', 62, 3, 8, 118695) This thought should dispel your grief and give you deep joy and make you see what is real and what is un real in life.
('62', 62, 3, 9, 118814) If one individual can possibly share the experience of another, I wish that you would share my experience as I am sharing your grief.
('62', 62, 3, 10, 118948) GIFT OF DEATH 3
('62', 62, 4, 11, 118964) If you have to depart, do so peacefully with the consciousness that you are going to your own home and with the Lords name inscribed in your heart.
('62', 62, 4, 12, 119112) If God wills to take some service from you through this very body of yours, He will save your life.
('62', 62, 4, 13, 119212) THE BEST USE OF THE ASHRAM
('62', 62, 5, 14, 119239) The Satyagraha Ashram has been permanently given away for Harijan work.
('62', 62, 5, 15, 119311) I feel that this is the best use it can be put to.
('62', 62, 5, 16, 119362) Since the Government did not take possession of it, there was no other equally good purpose for which it could have been used.
('62', 62, 5, 17, 119489) This was also the best way of sacrificing the Ashram.
('62', 62, 5, 18, 119543) Having regard to the ideals of the Ashram, everybody here feels that this is the best purpose for which it could be used.
('62', 62, 5, 19, 119665) A special committee will be appointed to run it.
('62', 62, 5, 20, 119714) It will not admit just any Harijan.
('62', 62, 5, 21, 119750) Whoever is admitted will have to abide by the rules of the place.
('62', 62, 5, 22, 119816) I see nothing wrong in the Ashram inmates being without a permanent abode and living anywhere contented with whatever comes their way.
('62', 62, 5, 23, 119951) When everything is over, we may set up another Ashram; that is the only proper course for us.

('62', 62, 6, 25, 120096) 2 This was in reply to a correspondent who had described his grief at the death of his wife and asked Gandhiji how he could cherish her memory so that it might be a source of joy without any shadow of grief.

('62', 63, 1, 2, 120403) QUESTIONS FROM A HARIJAN WORKER 1
('62', 63, 2, 3, 120437) I do not believe that many Harijan workers are taking more than what they need for their subsistence.
('62', 63, 2, 4, 120539) Some of them take nothing at all.
('62', 63, 2, 5, 120573) I do not know what is fat salary according to you.
('62', 63, 2, 6, 120624) I consider him the best propagandist who takes only enough for his food and cloth ing.
('62', 63, 2, 7, 120711) In our poor country we do not have a leisured class which would provide us national workers.

('62', 63, 6, 11, 120881) A gentleman makes the following suggestion 2 regarding munici palities, local boards, etc.
('62', 63, 6, 12, 120972) I think this suggestion certainly deserves consideration.
('62', 63, 6, 13, 121030) The municipalities themselves may not put the scheme into practice but where the local Harijan Sevak Sangh is prepared to take the respon sibility, the school buildings should be made over to them outside school hour rent free but on condition that the buildings and the furniture would be well looked after.
('62', 63, 6, 14, 121339) This will save rent and Harijans will have the benefit of better accommodation and amenities.

('62', 63, 9, 17, 121475) 74. SOME MORAL POSERS
('62', 63, 10, 18, 121497) The gentleman who has made suggestions regarding the muni cipalities, etc., has asked the following questions which are useful for all workers.
('62', 63, 11, 19, 121641) 1 The worker had complained that most of the temples remained closed toHarijans, workers doing Harijan service drew fat salaries, khadi workers took on interest in Harijan work and that villages were steeped in ignorance and superstition.
('62', 63, 11, 20, 121880) Paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 of Gandhijis answers are not translated here as they are covered by An M.A. in a Hurry 2 Not translated here.
('62', 63, 11, 21, 122012) The suggestion was that civic bodies should run night schools for Harijans and encourage them with financial aid.
('62', 63, 11, 22, 122126) 3 The questions are not translated here.
('62', 63, 11, 23, 122167) The correspondent had asked :
('62', 64, 0, 1, 122197) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 65
('62', 64, 1, 2, 122243) I would answer them in the following order (1) Any vow to be taken must be written out in precise terms.
('62', 64, 1, 3, 122348) It should be done in the presence of a witness , if available at the time.
('62', 64, 1, 4, 122423) If a doubt arises, it must be interpreted rigidly, not loosely.
('62', 64, 1, 5, 122487) Nothing should be appended to it, under the excuse of being left out, which would weaken it.
('62', 64, 1, 6, 122580) For instance, say, I pledge not to touch liquor.
('62', 64, 1, 7, 122629) No country has been mentioned in this pledge.
('62', 64, 1, 8, 122675) I then go to England and someone persuades me to take liquor on grounds of health.
('62', 64, 1, 9, 122758) Now, I cannot argue that since I happened to be in India at the time of taking the pledge it applied only to my stay there and that I was free to take liquor while abroad.
('62', 64, 1, 10, 122930) Nor can I permit myself to take liquor as a medicine on the ground that there was no mention of medicines in the pledge.
('62', 64, 1, 11, 123051) (2) As in the case of other activities, the time for prayer too must be fixed.
('62', 64, 1, 12, 123130) It matters little what time is fixed for it.
('62', 64, 1, 13, 123175) It is best to have it just before bed time and on waking up in the morning after cleaning one's teeth.
('62', 64, 1, 14, 123278) It is also necessary to have fixed hours of sleep.
('62', 64, 1, 15, 123329) No one can achieve concentration of mind all at once.
('62', 64, 1, 16, 123383) As the saying goes, "even hard black rocks can be cut with a rope." So concentration will automatically follow in the wake of regular praying.
('62', 64, 1, 17, 123526) So long as this is not attained, one should diligently continue to pray every day rather than worry about it.
('62', 64, 1, 18, 123636) You should never accept defeat, even if you die. (3) Never give up the practice of writing a diary once you have resolved to do so.
('62', 64, 1, 19, 123768) If not immediately, you will certainly realize its advantages later.
('62', 64, 1, 20, 123837) This habit itself will guard us against many of our shortcomings as the diary will be a permanent witness to these.
('62', 64, 1, 21, 123953) All the slips must be noted in the diary.
('62', 64, 1, 22, 123995) There is no need to condemn them.
('62', 64, 1, 23, 124029) Criticism is always taken for granted.
('62', 64, 1, 24, 124068) It is enough to mention, say, Today I was angry with B; today I deceived A. There is no need to make observations like, This was very unfortunate, Oh me!
('62', 64, 1, 25, 124222) I must not repeat it. Words in praise of oneself should never be there.
('62', 64, 1, 26, 124294) It is enough to note down the work done and the slips committed.
('62', 64, 1, 27, 124359) The diary should not take note of other peoples faults.
('62', 64, 1, 28, 124415) (4) This question does not appear to be right.
('62', 64, 1, 29, 124462) Neither the language of the Gita, nor my own, is aphoritics.
('62', 64, 1, 30, 124523) It is not proper to compare my language with the Gitas; I would be happy if I could
('62', 64, 2, 31, 124607) (1) What are the factors to be considered before taking a vow and whether in can be modified afterwards?
('62', 64, 2, 32, 124712) (2) Can the fixed times of prayer be immediately after waking and just before
('62', 65, 0, 1, 124790) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 66
('62', 65, 1, 2, 124831) write the language of the Gita, but I am far removed from it.
('62', 65, 1, 3, 124893) Whatever we read on a subject with which we have little familiarity, appears to us aphoristic.
('62', 65, 1, 4, 124988) Technical language is language which is adequate for the purposes of that subject alone.
('62', 65, 1, 5, 125077) To those who are not familair with it, it sounds aphoristic.
('62', 65, 1, 6, 125138) But this is one thing and the sutras 1 of Patanjali are another thing.
('62', 65, 1, 7, 125209) The latter leave many things unsaid.
('62', 65, 1, 8, 125246) This cannot be said of the Gita.
('62', 65, 1, 9, 125279) But here the author gives a new connotation to familiar expressions, which makes them difficult to understand.
('62', 65, 1, 10, 125390) My language has one quality, viz.
('62', 65, 1, 11, 125424) brevity.
('62', 65, 1, 12, 125433) However, it is imperfect, whereas the Gita is perfect.
('62', 65, 1, 13, 125488) When I say that my language is imperfect I do not imply that I have inadequate command over the language, although that too is true.
('62', 65, 1, 14, 125621) What is implied here is that my thoughts are imperfect.
('62', 65, 1, 15, 125677) Hence there is bound to be difficulty in understanding them.
('62', 65, 1, 16, 125738) As my thoughts mature, they will come to be expressed so as to be easily comprehended.
('62', 65, 1, 17, 125825) Having admitted this shortcoming in my language, I can still say that some readers do not make the fullest effort and then fail to understand even perfectly expressed ideas.
('62', 65, 1, 18, 125999) And then they blame me!
('62', 65, 1, 19, 126023) For example, let us take the instance cited by the correspondent himself.
('62', 65, 1, 20, 126097) Spinning is a tangible activity; it can therefore be actually demonstrated.
('62', 65, 1, 21, 126173) Agitation of the mind is intangible.
('62', 65, 1, 22, 126210) It is quite correct to say that restlessness can be got over by practice.
('62', 65, 1, 23, 126284) Today, we have no means for actually demonstrating [the truth of] this.
('62', 65, 1, 24, 126356) If we learn to reduce our thought processes to a visual image we would be able to obtain a picture of this practice too as we do of spinning.
('62', 65, 1, 25, 126498) At present we can only say that mental restlessness can be got rid of through diligent praying.
('62', 65, 1, 26, 126594) In this, one has to rely on the truthfulness of the student, i.e., his adherence to truth.
('62', 65, 1, 27, 126685) Who can know a person who pretends to pray while continuing to be agitated ?
('62', 65, 1, 28, 126762) Or, who is there to rebuke the individual who deceives himself every day and while praying daily makes many impossible plans ?
('62', 65, 1, 29, 126889) In other words, the success of practice depends entirely upon the sincerity of the aspirant.
('62', 65, 1, 30, 126982) If there is insincerity in spinning, it can be pointed out to the spinner, since it can be directly perceived.
('62', 65, 1, 31, 127093) (5) You should be satisfied with whatever little you get does not imply that a lazy person may rest satisfied with what he gets.
('62', 65, 1, 32, 127222) The implication is that one should be satisfied with what one gets after making constant and sincere effort.
('62', 65, 1, 33, 127331) That is to say that in addition to the utmost human effort, God in heaven has His say on the result.

('62', 73, 3, 5, 137358) If your son and daughter are keen on studies it would be the right thing to arrange for that.
('62', 73, 3, 6, 137452) It would be excellent if they learn some vocation.
('62', 73, 3, 7, 137503) It is impossible to have your son touring with me.
('62', 73, 3, 8, 137554) The present tour is rather [difficult].

('62', 73, 7, 13, 137748) October 24, 1933 Mr. Vithalbhai Patels death 4 removes one of the most pain staking and ablest of politicians.
('62', 73, 7, 14, 137859) His self sacrifice and whole hearted application to the work he undertook were beyond praise.
('62', 73, 7, 15, 137953) His capa city for work was amazing.
('62', 73, 7, 16, 137989) It has been truely said of him that whether as the President of the Bombay Corporation or of the Legis lative Assembly, he cleared his desk every day, and never allowed arrears to grow.
('62', 73, 7, 17, 138175) His death is a distinct loss to the country at this junc ture.
('62', 73, 7, 18, 138238) I cannot close this tribute without placing on record my deep appreciation of Mr. Subhas Chandra Boses magnificent and devoted nursing of Vithalbhai at much risk to his own health.

('62', 74, 3, 5, 138762) You must not give way to grief as you have done.
('62', 74, 3, 6, 138811) I hope you received my letter written to you on 15th inst.
('62', 74, 3, 7, 138870) There need be no apology for writing to me.
('62', 74, 3, 8, 138914) Do please write as often as you wish.
('62', 74, 3, 9, 138952) You have every right to have my opinion and advice.
('62', 74, 3, 10, 139004) If you can accept the advice I have given in my previous letter, it will solve all your difficulties.

('62', 74, 7, 14, 139215) DEAR THAKKAR BAPA, Here is a letter from Narasimhan 1 about the Southern tour.
('62', 74, 7, 15, 139294) I do not know why Rajagopalachari wants me to tour in the South as early as possible.
('62', 74, 7, 16, 139380) You will perhaps know.
('62', 74, 7, 17, 139403) I am asking Narasimhan to as certain the reason.
('62', 74, 7, 18, 139452) From your letter about N., I suspect that you think that I dont want to do anything with her, but that is not the case.
('62', 74, 7, 19, 139572) I am anxious to have her.
('62', 74, 7, 20, 139598) But she is so unhinged that she might not come at all.
('62', 74, 7, 21, 139653) Any way, I am telegraphing today to you and to the American Mission.
('62', 74, 7, 22, 139722) I know that The National Calls references to S. are all unmerited and vicious.
('62', 74, 7, 23, 139801) He has done no wrong to N. N. herself does not know why her passions were excited when she saw him at Sabarmati.
('62', 74, 7, 24, 139914) In the letter in which she told me this, she had acquitted S. of all blame.
('62', 74, 7, 25, 139990) Many women, like many men, often get excited over seeing some members of the opposite sex, and N., having led a life of complete abandon would naturally get excited.
('62', 74, 7, 26, 140156) I am asking S. to see you so that you can make his acquaintance and know him.
('62', 74, 7, 27, 140234) Now that you are in this case, it is much better for you to understand all the actors.
('62', 74, 7, 28, 140321) It will help me also to have your estimate of these actors, for I have not seen the last of

('62', 75, 0, 1, 140441) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 76
('62', 75, 1, 2, 140482) any of them.
('62', 75, 1, 3, 140495) I see that Ramnarayan cannot come for two months as Ramnath Suman was asking to be allowed to replace him for two or three months.
('62', 75, 1, 4, 140626) And it was a question whether you could agree and whether Ramnarayan would waive his claim in favour of Ramnath.
('62', 75, 1, 5, 140739) I suppose you know him.
('62', 75, 1, 6, 140763) He is quite capable and he will do all the work that you expect.
('62', 75, 1, 7, 140828) Of course, Chandrashankar cannot possibly cope with the correspondence, editing, and drawing up newspaper reports.
('62', 75, 1, 8, 140943) I have a copy of your letter to Negi.
('62', 75, 1, 9, 140981) You seem to have expected a reply from me to your letter about Biharilal, but in your letter enclosing his long letter to you, you told me that you would write further about him.
('62', 75, 1, 10, 141160) Naturally, therefore, I did not write, but I can now say generally that we may not create work for him.
('62', 75, 1, 11, 141264) If there is work for which he is fitted, it should undoubtedly be given to him, even though similar work can be done for less wages than what might have to be given to him.

('62', 76, 2, 3, 142391) October 25, 1933
('62', 76, 3, 4, 142408) DEAR SISTER, I must congratulate you on your proposed visit to Calcutta for the purpose of ending the custom of purdah among the sisters there.
('62', 76, 3, 5, 142552) Purdah is not only a superstitious obsession, I feel it also smacks of sin.
('62', 76, 3, 6, 142628) Purdah from whom ?
('62', 76, 3, 7, 142647) Are all men steeped in lust ?
('62', 76, 3, 8, 142677) Cannot a women retain her purity without observing purdah ?
('62', 76, 3, 9, 142737) Purity is a state of mind.
('62', 76, 3, 10, 142764) It ought to come spontaneously to all men.
('62', 76, 3, 11, 142807) In this age of reason women should serve Daridranarayana if they wish to protect their dharma.
('62', 76, 3, 12, 142902) They should also educate themelves.
('62', 76, 3, 13, 142938) Service of Darid ranarayana implies propagation of khadi, spinning, etc.
('62', 76, 3, 14, 143011) Harijan service implies washing off the stain of untouchability; both of these noble activities are Gods work.
('62', 76, 3, 15, 143122) And education can never be acquired while retaining the purdah.
('62', 76, 3, 16, 143186) Did Sita observe purdah in her wanderings with Rama in the forests ?
('62', 76, 3, 17, 143255) Has there ever been in the world a women more virtuous than Sita ?
('62', 76, 3, 18, 143322) Exhort the women to end the custom and preserve dharma.

('62', 77, 5, 10, 144058) I have told him that it should have been sent to you.
('62', 77, 5, 11, 144112) I advise its acceptance.
('62', 77, 5, 12, 144137) It arises out of a letter of bitter complaint received against him from Lahore.
('62', 77, 5, 13, 144217) I sent him a copy of it.
('62', 77, 5, 14, 144242) He strictly denied some of the charges made therein.
('62', 77, 5, 15, 144295) But accepted the one about practice.
('62', 77, 5, 16, 144332) Jamnalalji is anxious about his resignation.
('62', 77, 5, 17, 144377) My own opinion is that his too should be accepted.
('62', 77, 5, 18, 144428) He is anxious to go to prison but it worries him that he does not go at once.
('62', 77, 5, 19, 144506) I suppose Krishna is now in Bombay.
('62', 77, 5, 20, 144542) I see nothing in the paper about Mother now a days.
('62', 77, 5, 21, 144594) Is she better ?
('62', 77, 5, 22, 144610) Vithalbhais death was fully expected by me but the actuality is disturbing me.
('62', 77, 5, 23, 144689) His very opposition I valued.
('62', 77, 5, 24, 144719) It cleared my mind and enabled me to put my position more clearly before the country than I otherwise could have.

('62', 78, 3, 4, 145290) MY DEAR OLD BEARD, Your letter about Kamala does credit to you.
('62', 78, 3, 5, 145354) As I have to advise her, I was bound to know the reasons for your opinion.
('62', 78, 3, 6, 145429) You have given me the straightest opinion.
('62', 78, 3, 7, 145472) Raihana holds the contrary opinion.
('62', 78, 3, 8, 145508) Yours is based largely on instinct and so is Raihanas.
('62', 78, 3, 9, 145563) My instinct too has been against her.
('62', 78, 3, 10, 145601) But I have refused to act on my instinct in the face of her emphatic contradictions.
('62', 78, 3, 11, 145686) Of course I brought my own suspicions to her notice.
('62', 78, 3, 12, 145739) I hope you had a successful time in Amreli.
('62', 78, 3, 13, 145783) Did it do much good ?
('62', 78, 3, 14, 145805) Did you sell much khadi ?
('62', 78, 3, 15, 145831) Were you able to do some substantial Harijan work ?

('62', 78, 8, 22, 146077) It was not necessary to write more about the constitution of the Harijan Seva Sangh.
('62', 78, 8, 23, 146162) Whether we should immediately bring into being a semi democratic organization is a question for consideration.
('62', 78, 8, 24, 146273) I do not know whether under the appointment there is the power, but the plan that I have suggested 1 is feasible and can be enforced imme diately, that is, to register the Ashram in the names of the trustees that I have suggested.
('62', 78, 8, 25, 146504) You should discuss your idea with Thakkar Bapa and Hariji.
('62', 78, 8, 26, 146563) As to the Spinners Association, I had an absolutely free hand, and I evolved a plan which enabled it to become an easily operating and sound organization with immense posssibility for democrati

('62', 79, 1, 2, 146828) zation.
('62', 79, 1, 3, 146836) I wanted to write to you as soon as the decision for the transfer of the Ashram was taken, that, in view of that acquisition, the am bitious plan for Delhi should be abandoned.
('62', 79, 1, 4, 147013) But the hostel scheme is quite sound.
('62', 79, 1, 5, 147051) Of course, we shall want many such hostels; and I can see immense possibilities emerging from them, if they are properly mana ged.
('62', 79, 1, 6, 147182) When I am in Delhi you may take any work you like from me.
('62', 79, 1, 7, 147241) So far as Biharilal is concerned, if he will serve in connection with the hostel schemes and so on, we can utilize his services.
('62', 79, 1, 8, 147370) But I am very much against engaging paid preachers, Harijans or otherwise.
('62', 79, 1, 9, 147445) And in this matter we cannot be too firm.
('62', 79, 1, 10, 147487) As to my stay in Delhi, of course, it is to be regulated by you.
('62', 79, 1, 11, 147552) My own inclination would be to stay at Lakshminarayans 1 place.
('62', 79, 1, 12, 147616) I believe in sticking to old places, except on sound reasons for a departure.
('62', 79, 1, 13, 147694) For my health Parmeshwaris place would be ideal.
('62', 79, 1, 14, 147743) But I must not be made inaccessible.
('62', 79, 1, 15, 147780) To do so would defeat the purpose of the tour.
('62', 79, 1, 16, 147827) My stay should depend upon the work to be taken from me.
('62', 79, 1, 17, 147884) You will come to wrong decisions, if you always think of my convenience.
('62', 79, 1, 18, 147957) You can depend upon it that I shall make my own con venience, no matter where you put me.
('62', 79, 1, 19, 148047) For my stay in Calcutta, you should consult Dr. Bidhan, Satish Babu, etc.
('62', 79, 1, 20, 148121) I understand what you say about Mrs. Lahiri.
('62', 79, 1, 21, 148166) I did not give any opinion, because I had none.
('62', 79, 1, 22, 148214) As she had mentioned your name and as you know almost everybody in Calcutta, I thought I would forward that letter to you and have your opinion.
('62', 79, 1, 23, 148359) I have written to Dr. Bidhan also who has issued the certificate.
('62', 79, 1, 24, 148425) You may dismiss the matter from your mind for the time being at least.
('62', 79, 1, 25, 148496) If I form any opinion in the execution of which I need your assistance, I shall immediately let you know.

('62', 80, 4, 6, 149022) The grass has been given to a shepherd.

('62', 80, 4, 8, 149165) And nominal rent is to be recovered from Ramji 2 and others who are already residing there.I believe that there is a full map of the Ashram.

('62', 80, 4, 13, 149578) The trees are a most valuable part of the estate.
('62', 80, 4, 14, 149628) You have asked Parikshitlal to give you draft rules.
('62', 80, 4, 15, 149681) Evidently my letter sending you a copy of these was not received by you when you sent your letter.
('62', 80, 4, 16, 149780) I enclose herewith a letter received from Dr. Bidhan in connec tion with the collections.
('62', 80, 4, 17, 149870) You may destroy the letter after reading it.
('62', 80, 5, 18, 149915) Yours sincerely,
('62', 80, 6, 19, 149932) BAPU [PS.] You have done well in going to N.s rescue.

('62', 80, 10, 23, 150049) The reader must have been surprised to see the transfer of Harijan publication from Poona to Madras.
('62', 80, 10, 24, 150150) R. V. Sastri and Mrs. Sastri have dedicated themselves to Harijan service.
('62', 80, 10, 25, 150225) Sastri felt that in Poona he was not able to give full service to the cause and that in

('62', 81, 1, 3, 150507) The argument went home to me.
('62', 81, 1, 4, 150537) The result is the transfer of Harijan to Madras.
('62', 81, 1, 5, 150586) What will happen or can happen after 3rd August next need not worry the reader or me.
('62', 81, 1, 6, 150672) One step enough for me is as true of organizations as of individuals.
('62', 81, 1, 7, 150742) The additional advantage of the transfer to Madras is that Madras is the most advanced and cheapest city in all India for English printing.
('62', 81, 1, 8, 150882) And what can be better than that Harijan should be published in a Presidency where untouchability flourishes in all its unshapeliness ?
('62', 81, 1, 9, 151018) I entertain the hope that the transfer will not only be welcomed but appreciated by the reformers, the sanatanists and the Harijans in the South.
('62', 81, 1, 10, 151164) Harijan is designed to serve all these three.
('62', 81, 1, 11, 151210) An easy test of appreciation will be an increased circulation.

('62', 81, 3, 14, 151308) The longer I live the more do I realize that the happiness which I enjoy and which so many friends envy persists inspite of tragedies of which I have always had my due share.
('62', 81, 3, 15, 151483) The latest is the disappearance of N. I have no doubt that her repentance was sincere.
('62', 81, 3, 16, 151570) She struggled bravely against her past, but it did appear to me on my coming to Wardha that the struggle was getting too severe for her.
('62', 81, 3, 17, 151707) She was becoming unhinged and losing control over herself.
('62', 81, 3, 18, 151766) Previously, in one of her letters from Wardha, she had hinted that she might become insane.
('62', 81, 3, 19, 151858) All the affection that could be shown to her was shown.
('62', 81, 3, 20, 151914) She was never insensible to it.
('62', 81, 3, 21, 151946) She was most responsive.
('62', 81, 3, 22, 151971) But she was also most impulsive.
('62', 81, 3, 23, 152004) She has gone away without any money or belongings.
('62', 81, 3, 24, 152055) The reports published about her in the Delhi Press are sensational manufactures and do her grave injustice.
('62', 81, 3, 25, 152163) She cannot be held responsible for her actions in her present mental state.
('62', 81, 3, 26, 152239) Her proper place is in a philanthropic institution or in an asylum.
('62', 81, 3, 27, 152307) Those who will throw a few silver piecess at her out of false compassion, or in order to get rid of her, will do her no kindness.
('62', 81, 3, 28, 152437) Being irresponsible, she has been squandering what she has received.
('62', 81, 3, 29, 152506) I would esteem it a favour if those who may come in contact with her will give me her address and show this writing to her.

('62', 82, 1, 2, 152696) 101. KHADI AND HARIJANS
('62', 82, 2, 3, 152720) Very few people have any notion of what khadi means to Harijans.
('62', 82, 2, 4, 152785) Simple weaving is almost an exclusive speciality of Harijans, and even though mill spinning and weaving have deprived many Harijans of a source of livelihood, thousands of them are still dependant upon weaving.
('62', 82, 2, 5, 152996) But a friend argues : What is the use of keeping alive a perishing industry ?
('62', 82, 2, 6, 153074) Why not give them instead an industry that may be growing ?
('62', 82, 2, 7, 153134) Surely, you do not intend to confine them to worn out occupations even when you are devising all manner of means for their uplift otherwise. Indeed, I have desire to confine Harijans, or for that matter, anybody, to spinning and weaving or to any one occupation, if they can be more profitably employed in any other; only I do not take the gloomy view of hand spinning and weaving which the objector takes.
('62', 82, 2, 8, 153541) I personally believe that hand ginning, hand carding, hand spinning and hand weaving have a brilliant future, at least in India.
('62', 82, 2, 9, 153670) If the millions are to live with any degree of comfort, the mills must seek main custom outside India.
('62', 82, 2, 10, 153773) The villagers must be induced to supplement their scanty resources by hand spinning, hand weaving, etc., assuming that millions of villagers could be better employed, for the indigenous mills to supply all the needs of the nation means long delayseveral generationsand then, too, it must mean the need of big capital and dependence for machinery and technical skill upon foreign countries.
('62', 82, 2, 11, 154163) In the abstract, whilst there may be nothing wrong in depending upon foreign machinery and foreign skill, in practice it cannot but be a terrible handicap upon the mill industry.
('62', 82, 2, 12, 154342) So long as this industry has got to depend upon external help, it would be untrue to call it an indigenous industry.
('62', 82, 2, 13, 154459) On the other hand, khadi, as a village industry, requires very little capital.
('62', 82, 2, 14, 154538) The implements can all be manufactured in the villages them selves, and there is no lack of indigenous techincal skill.
('62', 82, 2, 15, 154658) The only thing necessary is to change the mentality of the people.
('62', 82, 2, 16, 154725) Inspite, therefore, of the most skilful arguments to the contrary, and of imposing statistics with regard to the output of mills, I remain con firmed in my opinion that khadi in India has a very big future.
('62', 82, 2, 17, 154932) What we may not do voluntarily and out of conviction, we shall be obliged to do through force of circumstances.
('62', 82, 2, 18, 155044) India has to live, that is, her millions have to live.
('62', 82, 2, 19, 155099) There is no difference of opinion as to the fact
('62', 83, 0, 1, 155148) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 84
('62', 83, 1, 2, 155189) that they are not living today.
('62', 83, 1, 3, 155221) They are merely existing.
('62', 83, 1, 4, 155247) There is no other country in the world where so many million of people have only partial employment and where, inspite of the civilization being predominantly rural, the holdings are rarely two acres per head.
('62', 83, 1, 5, 155457) To manufacture the whole of her cloth requirements through steam or electricity, or any other than the human power behind the wheel, is still further to deepen the unemployment of the population.
('62', 83, 1, 6, 155653) An indus trialized India must, therefore, mean utter extinction of many millions, including, naturally, Harijans, who occupy, to our utter shame, the lowest strata of society.
('62', 83, 1, 7, 155829) It is said that through highly industrialized processes every American owns what is equivalent to 36 slaves.
('62', 83, 1, 8, 155938) If we use America as our model, and if we allowed only 30 slaves to every Indian instead of 36, out of our 31 crores of human beings, 30 crores must perform hara kiri or be killed off.
('62', 83, 1, 9, 156123) I know that some enthusiastic patriots will not only not mind such a process, but they will welcome it.
('62', 83, 1, 10, 156227) They will say that it is better to have one crore of happy, contented, prosperous Indians, armed to the teeth, than to have 30 crores of unarmed creatures who can hardly walk.
('62', 83, 1, 11, 156403) I have no answer to that philosophy, because, being saturated with the Harijan mentality, I can only think in terms of the millions of villagers and can only make my happiness dependent upon that of the poorest amongst them, and want to live only if they can live.My very simple mind cannot go beyond the little spindle of the little wheel which I can carry about with me from place to place and which I can manufacture without difficulty.
('62', 83, 1, 12, 156843) In this con nection a friend sends me the following paragraph 1 which is going round the Press :
('62', 83, 2, 13, 156940) To relieve unemployment in certain industries the Nazis have ordered the stoppage of the use of machines which were displacing human labour.
('62', 83, 2, 14, 157081) Commenting on this interdiction the Manchester Guardian remarks : There
('62', 83, 3, 15, 157153) has been a great deal of discussion about the effects of machinery in aggravating the unemployment crisis, but it has been left to the Nazis to do the logical thing and stop using it.
('62', 83, 3, 16, 157337) Mr. Gandhis efforts to replace the spinning frame by the hand wheel and the mechanical loom by the handloom are being paralleled closely in the German cigar and glass industries. The Guardian concludes its remarks by observing that, if Ger manys ethics become mediaeval, there is no reason why her eco nomics should not become mediaeval also.Replying to these

('62', 84, 2, 3, 157844) Hitler, Gandhi and others who in different ways are endeavouring to slow production to a point at which all goods are consumed may be reverting to mediaeval methods, but handicrafts are neither retrograde nor barbaric.
('62', 84, 2, 4, 158063) They are taught in every progressive elementary and secondary school .
('62', 84, 2, 5, 158134) So long as machinery promotes the happiness and the prosperity of the masses as well as the classes it is a beneficent agent.
('62', 84, 2, 6, 158260) But when it leads to the unemployment and starvation of millions, as is happening in the highly industrialized countries of the West, it becomes a curse.
('62', 84, 2, 7, 158414) Machinery exists for man, and not vice versa, and must be made subservient to the well being of the people and should not be allowed to become their master.
('62', 84, 2, 8, 158571) That the village industries in Germany are being revived at the point of the sword is not relevant here.
('62', 84, 2, 9, 158676) What is relevant is that a country, which has shown the highest techincal skill and is amongst the most advanced in the matter of industrialization, is trying to go back to village industries for solving the problem of her terrible un employment.

('62', 84, 5, 13, 159051) Many Harijans also know him very well.
('62', 84, 5, 14, 159090) But running the Harijan Ashram or Mandir or Nivas, whatever you call it, is to be your responsibility.
('62', 84, 5, 15, 159193) You should, there fore, follow your own plan.
('62', 84, 5, 16, 159239) Treat me as an adviser only.
('62', 84, 5, 17, 159268) I made the suggestion as is my wont and I may make many more such suggestions.
('62', 84, 5, 18, 159347) Please remember that you are not bound to accept any of them.
('62', 84, 5, 19, 159409) Your going out in search of N. has deeply impressed me.
('62', 84, 5, 20, 159465) Though I have had sufficient experience of your concern for others, your boundless compassion for N. fills me with the deepest admi ration.
('62', 84, 5, 21, 159605) Other friends have roundly blamed me for going out of my way to help her.
('62', 84, 5, 22, 159679) You, on the contrary, seem to have got annoyed by my apparent indifference on this occassion.
('62', 84, 5, 23, 159773) I bow to you in reverence a thousand times.
('62', 84, 5, 24, 159817) Where my love has failed, may yours succeed in melting her heart.
('62', 84, 5, 25, 159883) I understood your point in what you said regarding Utkal in your letter to Chandrashankar.

('62', 85, 4, 5, 160301) DEAR MOTIBABU, I was wondering why in reply to my postcard I had not heard from anyone about you.
('62', 85, 4, 6, 160399) The delay has been more than made up for by your long and affectionate letter.
('62', 85, 4, 7, 160478) Let us be thankful that one eye remains for the present.
('62', 85, 4, 8, 160535) But, as you say, if God wills it that the other eye should also go, He shall be praised.
('62', 85, 4, 9, 160624) I was sorry to hear of Swami Brahmanands death.
('62', 85, 4, 10, 160672) Death is a never failing friend.
('62', 85, 4, 11, 160705) He comes to our assistance sometimes even when he is least expected.
('62', 85, 4, 12, 160774) And it is our want of faith that makes us feel sorry when he comes.
('62', 85, 4, 13, 160842) I am glad you are prosecuting your khadi programme with an ever increasing faith.
('62', 85, 4, 14, 160924) When I travel in Bengal I shall be travelling like a prisoner under custody, going wherever my keepers would take me; and if they take me to your Ashram I should be, of course, delighted.
('62', 85, 4, 15, 161112) You will, therefore, settle with the Head Jailor, Dr. Bidhan Roy; or you may write to the Asstt.

('62', 86, 2, 4, 161893) Babo doesnt feel shy with me this time.
('62', 86, 2, 5, 161933) His health also is fine.
('62', 86, 2, 6, 161958) He and I play on the Japanese sadhus drum.
('62', 86, 2, 7, 162001) The sadhu is a jewel.
('62', 86, 2, 8, 162023) He is extremely frank humble, cheerful and courteous.
('62', 86, 2, 9, 162077) He is learning Hindi.
('62', 86, 2, 10, 162099) He also spins on the charkha and the takli.
('62', 86, 2, 11, 162143) He observes all the rules scrupulously.
('62', 86, 2, 12, 162183) I have given many hours to both the young women.
('62', 86, 2, 13, 162232) This morning I gave nearly two hours.
('62', 86, 2, 14, 162270) I will give more time still at 11.30. They have come in great haste and are in equally great haste to return.
('62', 86, 2, 15, 162380) They have, therefore, given me notice that they intend to return today by the Mail train.
('62', 86, 2, 16, 162470) Manis leg seems to require electric treatment and Mridu has to attend on some women who are ill.
('62', 86, 2, 17, 162567) The two have formed an excellent pair.
('62', 86, 2, 18, 162606) 1 Pattabhi 2 was here.
('62', 86, 2, 19, 162629) I hardly met him for ten minutes.
('62', 86, 2, 20, 162663) He had turned up without intimation.
('62', 86, 2, 21, 162700) Jamnalalji rarely permits any body much time with me.
('62', 86, 2, 22, 162754) Even to the representatives of mill workers [from Ahmedabad] he permitted one and a half hours in all in three sessions.
('62', 86, 2, 23, 162875) He guards me with the strictest vigilance.
('62', 86, 2, 24, 162918) I was certainly grieved by Vithalbhais death, though for himself it was a deliverance.
('62', 86, 2, 25, 163005) We had well known that he would die in a foreign country.
('62', 86, 2, 26, 163063) He seems to have been looked after very well.
('62', 86, 2, 27, 163109) Subhas, it seems, was beyond all praise.
('62', 86, 2, 28, 163150) From all sources I hear reports of his wonderful attention to Vithalbhai.
('62', 86, 2, 29, 163224) I have written to him.
('62', 86, 2, 30, 163247) You also should write.
('62', 86, 2, 31, 163270) My letter was posted before the news of Vithal bhais death was received.
('62', 86, 2, 32, 163343) Swami will remain here for some time yet.
('62', 86, 2, 33, 163385) Thakkar Bapa has gone to Brindaban in search of N. His compassion has no limit.
('62', 86, 2, 34, 163465) The woman is out of her mind.
('62', 86, 2, 35, 163495) She never misbehaved here.
('62', 86, 2, 36, 163522) She had gone insane.
('62', 86, 2, 37, 163543) She has still not come out of the woods.
('62', 86, 2, 38, 163584) If she comes back, I will take her in again.
('62', 86, 2, 39, 163629) Amala is working hard at present.
('62', 86, 2, 40, 163663) Duncan has buried himself in a village.
('62', 86, 2, 41, 163703) Mary Barr is still here.
('62', 86, 2, 42, 163728) She has recovered from her illness.
('62', 86, 2, 43, 163764) Vinoba has been doing wonderful work for Harijans in villages Mani has gone with Anandi.

('62', 88, 3, 4, 165267) BHAI VALLABHBHAI, There was a wire from Subhas today saying that Vithalbhais body will reach Bombay on the 9th and that you should perform the cremation rites.
('62', 88, 3, 5, 165427) I have replied through the Press that I dont believe it likely that you will make a request to be released and that the rites should be performed without you, by Dahyabhai.
('62', 88, 3, 6, 165600) There was no time to consult you, nor did I think it proper to do so.
('62', 88, 3, 7, 165670) If you have any thing to say, please let me know.
('62', 88, 3, 8, 165720) I am writing to Dahyabhai.

('62', 88, 3, 11, 165850) There has been no loss of weight so far.
('62', 88, 3, 12, 165891) He continues to work in bed.

('62', 88, 4, 14, 165943) is still here.

('62', 89, 2, 5, 166788) There is no question at all of asking forgiveness of Thakkar Bapa.
('62', 89, 2, 6, 166855) But be sure that there was no contempt in Thakkar Bapas language.
('62', 89, 2, 7, 166921) His language is not polite.
('62', 89, 2, 8, 166949) But I see him as the very embodiment of kindness.
('62', 89, 2, 9, 166999) My close association with him fills me with joy.
('62', 89, 2, 10, 167048) His love is boundless.
('62', 89, 2, 11, 167071) I can see it not in his letters but in his work.
('62', 89, 2, 12, 167120) I have come to believe that no one is lowly in his eyes.
('62', 89, 2, 13, 167177) How can I convince you of it?
('62', 89, 2, 14, 167207) You should come here and carry back a little comfort.
('62', 89, 2, 15, 167261) Why should your mind be in turmoil?
('62', 89, 2, 16, 167297) What wrong have you committed?
('62', 89, 2, 17, 167328) What does it matter what others think of you?
('62', 89, 2, 18, 167374) Why should it disturb you?
('62', 89, 2, 19, 167401) What is it that troubles you?
('62', 89, 2, 20, 167431) I can never believe that Thakkar Bapas letter could have distressed you so much.
('62', 89, 2, 21, 167512) Nobody has complained against your nature to make me consider you worthless.
('62', 89, 2, 22, 167589) And could you ever be worthy or unworthy in my eyes merely because someone says so?
('62', 89, 2, 23, 167673) Do I have to know you through others?
('62', 89, 2, 24, 167711) You must shake off your anguish.
('62', 89, 2, 25, 167744) Come here and lighten your heart.
('62', 89, 2, 26, 167778) Your misery makes me unhappy.
('62', 89, 2, 27, 167808) I am enclosing two letters from Harakhchand.

('62', 90, 1, 2, 168312) 110. A TEACHERS DOUBTS
('62', 90, 2, 3, 168335) A teacher was somewhat puzzled while explaining to his students my writings under Mangal Prabhat 1 and he has asked certain ques tions regarding them.
('62', 90, 2, 4, 168486) Here is the first one : 2
('62', 90, 3, 5, 168512) My experience to date suggests that ones good lies in following the path which appears right to oneself.
('62', 90, 3, 6, 168617) One has to discover for one self the path followed by great men, and find for oneself who are great men.
('62', 90, 3, 7, 168722) A great man who appears a paragon to one individual may seem worthless to another.
('62', 90, 3, 8, 168805) There have been cases in which two individuals both regarding the same person as an authority interpret his words and actions in two opposite ways.
('62', 90, 3, 9, 168953) The story of Virochana and Indra 3 is well known.
('62', 90, 3, 10, 169003) At every step I comes to the forefront.
('62', 90, 3, 11, 169043) But the task is not accomplished even by my saying this.
('62', 90, 3, 12, 169100) It cannot be claimed that what occurs to us is always the truth.
('62', 90, 3, 13, 169165) What appears to me as truth today, may appear to be untruth after a couple of days.
('62', 90, 3, 14, 169249) What is regarded as truth by a few has often been denounced by many.
('62', 90, 3, 15, 169318) Hence we come to this terrible conclusion : Man can have a glimpse of truth only after making mistakes, stumbling on the way and tread ing dangerous paths.
('62', 90, 3, 16, 169474) However, all this perplexity arises from a disregard of the prere quisites for the quest of truth.
('62', 90, 3, 17, 169573) Entitlement and eligibility are as much essential in the case of truth as in any other.
('62', 90, 3, 18, 169661) The person who wishes to see Truth in the form of God must observe the yamaniyamas 4. Anyone who has not thus attained eligibility lacks the insight; he is as good as blind.
('62', 90, 3, 19, 169835) Anyone who claims to have seen truth without so much as trying to develop the eye for catching a glimpse of it would look as ludicrous as one who presumes to impart knowledge of astronomy without having studied it.

('62', 91, 0, 1, 170475) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 92
('62', 91, 1, 2, 170516) The teachers second question is as follows: 1
('62', 91, 2, 3, 170562) In saying We have come to the border line, etc., my only intention was to say that we could now have an easy access to the subject.
('62', 91, 2, 4, 170694) While discussing truth, we inevitably come to non violence.
('62', 91, 2, 5, 170754) That there can be no truth without non violence has been proved to be as plain as the fact that two and two make four.
('62', 91, 2, 6, 170873) The teachers third question is as follows: 2
('62', 91, 3, 7, 170918) The sentence quoted here is a good example of my inadequate expression.
('62', 91, 3, 8, 170990) I remember having some difficulty while drafting the article.
('62', 91, 3, 9, 171052) I could not find the words I was looking for.
('62', 91, 3, 10, 171098) However, if my condition is pitiable, the teachers is no less so.
('62', 91, 3, 11, 171164) We all go on chanting the word non violence but little do we inquire into its true nature.
('62', 91, 3, 12, 171255) We do not act in accordance with what it has been described to be, hence the language used with reference to it seems like a Chinese puzzle.
('62', 91, 3, 13, 171396) The teacher has used expressions like destroying,facing, difficulties, suffering,winning them over, etc., but they have failed to reveal their full meaning to him.
('62', 91, 3, 14, 171560) His very language suggests it.
('62', 91, 3, 15, 171591) I do not regard this as his failing.
('62', 91, 3, 16, 171628) This imperfection is almost universal.
('62', 91, 3, 17, 171667) By saying all this, I have put before the reader my difficulty and our ignorance of the subject.
('62', 91, 3, 18, 171764) I believe I quite understand what I want to say, but I have not yet struck upon the language which would aptly convey my meaning.
('62', 91, 3, 19, 171894) But I shall not accept defeat.
('62', 91, 3, 20, 171925) Success is sure to come with repeated efforts Non violence does not destroy, it sustains.
('62', 91, 3, 21, 172015) Hence it meets difficulties by overcoming them.
('62', 91, 3, 22, 172063) My yarn often gets entangled.
('62', 91, 3, 23, 172093) If I cut it off, so much yarn goes waste.
('62', 91, 3, 24, 172135) Cutting it off is easy and the process is over in no time.
('62', 91, 3, 25, 172194) But, it does not lead me to truth.
('62', 91, 3, 26, 172229) I face the knot disentangling it, which is time consuming.
('62', 91, 3, 27, 172288) But it saves the yarn and I learn a lesson in patience.
('62', 91, 3, 28, 172344) When the knot is disentangled, my joy knows no bounds.
('62', 91, 3, 29, 172399) I clear the way for other spinners.
('62', 91, 3, 30, 172435) I add to my knowledge.
('62', 91, 3, 31, 172458) I find that the time spent was not wasted, and thus I learn that the apparently easy and quick method of cutting up the knot was
('62', 91, 4, 32, 172587) 1 It was: In the concluding part of your article on Truth you say, We have come to the border line beyond which lies ahimsa. Do you mean that the former is a means to the latter ? 2 It read: What do you mean when you say that one makes progress by putting up with difficulties, not by counteracting them ?
('62', 91, 4, 33, 172893) What is your definition of non violence in the restricted sense ?
('62', 92, 0, 1, 172959) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 93
('62', 92, 1, 2, 173005) not correct and therefore not quick either.
('62', 92, 1, 3, 173049) While disen tangling the knot, not only did I face the difficulty but by living with it after having accepted it as such, I also learnt that I was the author of it.
('62', 92, 1, 4, 173214) The responsibility for its coming into being rested with me.
('62', 92, 1, 5, 173275) I believe I have shown through the above example how many virtues are acquired by suffering in this manner.
('62', 92, 1, 6, 173383) I think other in stances too could be easily interpreted to yield the essence of my writings.
('62', 92, 1, 7, 173477) Examples will be readly available.
('62', 92, 1, 8, 173512) But this does not imply that all the problems of non violence are capable of being solved.
('62', 92, 1, 9, 173603) Or that somebody has all the keys.
('62', 92, 1, 10, 173638) This philosophy has not yet reached perfection.
('62', 92, 1, 11, 173686) Could any be said to have done so ?
('62', 92, 1, 12, 173722) The knowledge of the scientist seems to be no more than the growing realization of his own ignorance.
('62', 92, 1, 13, 173824) Non violence is an abstruse science.
('62', 92, 1, 14, 173861) We shall have to make many experiments, many people will have to sacrifice themselves.
('62', 92, 1, 15, 173948) All that can be said with certainty at present is that non violence appears to be the only straight and the shortest path to realization of God in the form of Truth.
('62', 92, 1, 16, 174114) For a long time we have been treading the path of violence, but we seem to be going farther away from truth.
('62', 92, 1, 17, 174223) The killing of lower animals, small insects and even plants in volves violence and is, therefore, sinful too.
('62', 92, 1, 18, 174333) Nothing that is embodied can continue to do so without committing sin.
('62', 92, 1, 19, 174404) From the worldly standpoint, however, the minimum inevitable violence committed for preserving the body is not regarded as sin.
('62', 92, 1, 20, 174532) We can now define violence in its narrow connotation.
('62', 92, 1, 21, 174586) The wilful, wanton or arbitrary destruction of any living organism even smaller than an insect, is violence; not wishing, committing or abetting it is non violence.

('62', 94, 1, 9, 176794) Now he only drinks milk, not even water.
('62', 94, 1, 10, 176835) Today is the third day since he started drinking milk.
('62', 94, 1, 11, 176890) He increases the quantity daily by half a pound.
('62', 94, 1, 12, 176939) Today he will drink three pounds.
('62', 94, 1, 13, 176973) We may not predict the result just now.
('62', 94, 1, 14, 177013) Swami Anand is here.
('62', 94, 1, 15, 177034) All of them will be here only for a few days now.
('62', 94, 1, 16, 177084) Kumarappa came and went back.
('62', 94, 1, 17, 177114) Vinoba has composed the following verse 1 enumerating the eleven vows.
('62', 94, 1, 18, 177185) It is sung daily once or twice.
('62', 94, 1, 19, 177217) Ahimsa, truth, non stealing, brahmacharya, non possession;
('62', 94, 2, 20, 177276) Body labour, control of the palate and complete freedom from fear : Equal regard for all religions, swadeshi and looking upon all human beings as touchables : The eleven vows one should observe, with humility and resolve.
('62', 94, 2, 21, 177498) Mani and Bablo left with Anandi.
('62', 94, 2, 22, 177531) Vanamala and Mohan must have joined them from Kathlal.
('62', 94, 2, 23, 177586) Totaramji and Hariprasad 2 are here.
('62', 94, 2, 24, 177623) They will be sent to Sabarmati for Harijan work.
('62', 94, 2, 25, 177672) Vithalbhais body will reach Bombay on the 9th.
('62', 94, 2, 26, 177719) It will be carried to the cremation ground with due honours and Dahyabhai will light the funeral pyre.
('62', 94, 2, 27, 177822) Manibehn and Mridulabehn were here and stayed for three days.
('62', 94, 2, 28, 177884) If in giving all this news I have repeated any details, I hope you will remember that I have grown old and forgive me.
('62', 94, 2, 29, 178003) If I remembered all the letters which I write, I would be crushed by the weight of that memory itself.
('62', 94, 2, 30, 178106) Just as the power of memory is worth preserving, so also the ability to forget is worth cultivating.
('62', 94, 2, 31, 178207) If we dont have it, we would always be either laughing or crying.
('62', 94, 2, 32, 178273) However, this was a little sermon by the way.
('62', 94, 2, 33, 178319) Instead of omitting any news, would it not be better to take the risk of repeating some details ?
('62', 94, 3, 34, 178417) 1 The verse is in Marathi.

('62', 95, 1, 2, 178519) And now replies to your questions.
('62', 95, 1, 3, 178554) What you say is perfectly true.
('62', 95, 1, 4, 178586) What can physical control avail ? 1 Can we force anyone to remain unmarried ?
('62', 95, 1, 5, 178664) Devdas and Prabhudas remained so till the age of 32, and married only when they found that they could no longer control themselves.
('62', 95, 1, 6, 178796) Is it not better that one should humbly admit ones weakness rather than let the mind run after lustful thoughts ?
('62', 95, 1, 7, 178910) I can testify that both of them tried hard to remain unmarried.
('62', 95, 2, 8, 178974) He who curbs the organs of action but allows the mind to dwell on the
('62', 95, 3, 9, 179044) sense objects such a one, wholly deluded, is called a hypocrite.
('62', 95, 4, 10, 179109) If, then, both of them humbly express their desire to marry, it would be violence on my part to refuse them my blessings.
('62', 95, 4, 11, 179231) They will continue to cherish the ideal of brahmacharya.
('62', 95, 4, 12, 179288) One should strive hard to live up to an ideal, but if, despite ones best efforts, one cannot control ones mind, it would be better to be content with what one can do rather than live as a hypocrite.
('62', 95, 4, 13, 179487) Anybody who acts in this manner deserves the blessings of his elders.
('62', 95, 4, 14, 179557) One should stretch ones limbs, as the saying is, according to the length of the covering.
('62', 95, 4, 15, 179647) In short, he who does not deceive himself or the world goes forward in the end.
('62', 95, 4, 16, 179727) If I have not succeeded in explaining this idea, you may put me your questions when you get an opportunity.
('62', 95, 4, 17, 179835) I have had no letter from Indu recently, but Keshu had one.
('62', 95, 4, 18, 179895) He is quite happy.
('62', 95, 4, 19, 179914) Balbhadra and Dhiru also are with him.
('62', 95, 4, 20, 179953) Manibhai Kothari is in Wadhwan.
('62', 95, 4, 21, 179985) He is doing Harijan and khadi work there.
('62', 95, 4, 22, 180027) My tour will commence on the 8th.
('62', 95, 4, 23, 180061) I have already given you the names of the persons who will accompany me.
('62', 95, 4, 24, 180134) The name of Ramnath Suman should be added to the list.
('62', 95, 4, 25, 180189) He is lover of Hindi literature, and a good writer.

('62', 96, 2, 4, 180592) JAYAPRAKASH, I have your letter.
('62', 96, 2, 5, 180625) Jamnalalji has given me the letter you wrote to him.
('62', 96, 2, 6, 180678) Jamnalalji is a bit chary of providing assistance to people in this manner.
('62', 96, 2, 7, 180754) But he wants to help you.
('62', 96, 2, 8, 180780) He however feels that a loan should be a loan according to proper legal formalities.
('62', 96, 2, 9, 180865) The interest may well be slight or none at all but the land you finally decide to mortgage should be mortgaged now.
('62', 96, 2, 10, 180981) That is one thing.
('62', 96, 2, 11, 181000) The other is: How much is the debt you have to repay?
('62', 96, 2, 12, 181054) How did you happen to borrow from the A.I.C.C.?
('62', 96, 2, 13, 181102) How did you incur the other debts?
('62', 96, 2, 14, 181137) After you get the sum you want, are you sure you will not need to borrow any more money?
('62', 96, 2, 15, 181226) What do you intend to do now?
('62', 96, 2, 16, 181256) If it is necessary for you to come here to clarify all this, you may come, or reply fully through letter.
('62', 96, 2, 17, 181362) I hope you are well.

('62', 96, 7, 27, 181635) Will you put down as briefly as you can the reasons for your asking patients under milk treatment to drink as much water as milk you prescribe for them?

('62', 97, 2, 3, 182007) October 30, 1933
('62', 97, 3, 4, 182024) MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL, I have your letter about the Hospital 1. You ought to be able to say without fear of contradiction that the Swaraj Bhawan Dispensary is a perfect fraud and thoroughly boycotted.
('62', 97, 3, 5, 182222) Without absolute proof, I am disinclined to believe that they fabricate cases.
('62', 97, 3, 6, 182301) I am anxious to have this evidence, because it is necessary for framing my opinion about the Congress Hospital, for, I feel that we should be able to take possession of the Swaraj Bhawan strictly for Hospital work, if the Government management has proved to be a fiasco.
('62', 97, 3, 7, 182572) If you think that the Congress Hospital or Dispensary should be run in the place where it is now being run and that no attempt whatsoever should be made to regain possession of the Swaraj Bhawan, an appeal certainly becomes necessary and then it should be issued in the names of Mohanlal Nehru 2 and Kamala.
('62', 97, 3, 8, 182880) I am glad that Mother is making steady progress.
('62', 97, 3, 9, 182929) Evidently the successful conclusion of the marriage ceremony has also something to do with easing the mental strain she was having.
('62', 97, 3, 10, 183061) Andrews is expected here on Wednesday.
('62', 97, 3, 11, 183100) I understand what you say about Jamnalalji.
('62', 97, 3, 12, 183144) When do you think it may be safely announced ?
('62', 97, 3, 13, 183191) Thakkar Bapa writes saying that you prohibited Congressmen from working for Harijan cause, even though they may not be offering civil resistence.
('62', 97, 3, 14, 183337) Where is the truth!
('62', 97, 3, 15, 183357) I have known nothing about any such embargo.
('62', 97, 4, 16, 183402) BAPU Gandhi Nehru Papers, 1933. Courtesy : Nehru Memorial Museum and Library.
('62', 97, 5, 17, 183480) 1 A hospital run by the Congress in the Swaraj Bhawan was taken over by the Government in 1931. After some time the British authorities more for show than for anything else decided to keep a dispensary open for the public.
('62', 97, 5, 18, 183703) But, the addressee wrote, there is no evidence that even a single member of the public has ever taken advantage of it .
('62', 97, 5, 19, 183823) I am told false entries are made in their books to show that many patients are being treated. After the seizure of this hospital, the Congress had started another which from April, 1932 was being run in a cottage adjoining the Swaraj Bhawan.
('62', 97, 5, 20, 184065) The resources to run the Congress Hospital had been almost exhausted. 2 Addressees cousin

('62', 98, 2, 4, 184263) MRIDULA, I have your letter.
('62', 98, 2, 5, 184292) At first I thought of sending you a telegram about my going.
('62', 98, 2, 6, 184353) But then I had second thoughts.
('62', 98, 2, 7, 184385) This letter should reach you tomorrow morning so I have not sent the telegram.
('62', 98, 2, 8, 184464) I think I will not ask either you or Mani to come here for the time being.
('62', 98, 2, 9, 184539) Certainly not before the 8th, because, once the travelling begins, I would not like to send for anyone.
('62', 98, 2, 10, 184643) It is another matter if you find it necessary to meet me and come.
('62', 98, 2, 11, 184710) You would be free to do that.
('62', 98, 2, 12, 184740) That is why I do not wish to stop you from going to Allaha bad for the sake of keeping you near by.
('62', 98, 2, 13, 184840) But you have already talked to me and there is no need to go just for that.
('62', 98, 2, 14, 184916) Still it may be necessary for you to have your case prepared and send it.
('62', 98, 2, 15, 184990) But if you want to go to understand Jawaharlals mind do go.
('62', 98, 2, 16, 185050) You may also place before him all your complaints.
('62', 98, 2, 17, 185101) Then you may let me know what he feels or ask him to inform me.
('62', 98, 2, 18, 185165) I have not written anything to him.
('62', 98, 2, 19, 185201) I have started the work.
('62', 98, 2, 20, 185226) I have not sent your note, but have conveyed your complaint to Shankerlal.
('62', 98, 2, 21, 185301) I am required to solve a great many problems within a shore time.
('62', 98, 2, 22, 185367) I hope you have had your teeth properly attended to.
('62', 98, 2, 23, 185420) Illness refuses to take leave of Saralabehn.
('62', 98, 2, 24, 185465) She keeps having some trouble or other.

('62', 99, 2, 15, 186232) If everywhere you find only dirt keep yourself aloof.
('62', 99, 2, 16, 186286) Personal selfishness appears to be playing a considerable part in this matter.
('62', 99, 2, 17, 186365) The money for Utkal does not seem to be coming.

('62', 100, 6, 13, 188027) MY DEAR ANAND, I have your letter about Devdas.
('62', 100, 6, 14, 188075) You have given me a good account.
('62', 100, 6, 15, 188109) I can see from it how delighted Devdas must have been to receive news from an eye witness.
('62', 100, 6, 16, 188200) But I must confine this letter to the bombs which you say have burst upon you.
('62', 100, 6, 17, 188279) You must not exaggerate things that come from Father.
('62', 100, 6, 18, 188333) You have to be prepared for these things, and if you will but keep calm and yet firm, all the clouds will vanish.
('62', 100, 6, 19, 188447) You should talk gently but firmly to both the parents and tell them that you must be allowed to regulate your future.
('62', 100, 6, 20, 188565) They have given you a liberal education.
('62', 100, 6, 21, 188606) They may not now quarrel with the fruits thereof.
('62', 100, 6, 22, 188656) Having made your position absolutely clear in as humble a manner as possible, you should take your own line of action.
('62', 100, 6, 23, 188775) You may avoid arrest in Karachi.
('62', 100, 6, 24, 188808) After all, Hyderabad is your scene of action, and there you will act in consultation with friends.
('62', 100, 6, 25, 188907) One thing you should avoid as a good satyagrahi.
('62', 100, 6, 26, 188956) You may not consult your convenience or predilections in choosing the scene of action.
('62', 100, 6, 27, 189043) You should therefore, dismiss the idea of courting arrest somewhere near Wardha.
('62', 100, 6, 28, 189124) You may not do it outside Sind.
('62', 100, 6, 29, 189156) It would be inconsistent with the spirit of satyagraha.
('62', 100, 6, 30, 189212) I have discussed the whole situation with Vidya, and I think she agrees with me.
('62', 100, 6, 31, 189293) I did not have to reason with her, but she volunteered the statement that when she resigned herself to your seeking imprison ment and her remaining in Wardha, she concurrently resigned herself not to see you during your incarceration.
('62', 100, 6, 32, 189528) It would be enough, she said,

('62', 101, 1, 2, 189600) if you are permitted to write to her as, of course, you would be, and I think that is the correct position even though you may not seek arrest in Karachi.
('62', 101, 1, 3, 189755) Vidya is really getting on excellently.
('62', 101, 1, 4, 189795) She does not look moody; she is not morbid and is feeling more and more cheerful.
('62', 101, 1, 5, 189877) And I expect you too to be cheerful and to write cheerful letters to her.

('62', 101, 5, 10, 190062) October 31, 1933
('62', 101, 6, 11, 190079) CHHAGANLAL, Rama and Vimala 1 arrived yesterday.
('62', 101, 6, 12, 190128) Since you have seen them only recently, I do not write anything about them.
('62', 101, 6, 13, 190204) I understand from Rama that you get the letters written to you and that you are eagerly expecting a letter from me.
('62', 101, 6, 14, 190320) You are certainly entitled to expect one.
('62', 101, 6, 15, 190362) But I did not write any, thinking that, when Rama herself could write very few letters, it would not be proper on my part to claim a share in the number of letters which you are permitted to receive.
('62', 101, 6, 16, 190562) However, as Damayanti asked even trees for news of Nala, I used to inquire about you from anybody and everybody whom I met and managed to get some news.
('62', 101, 6, 17, 190715) You must, of course, make a return for having stayed with me for such a long time, and you have done so handsomely enough.
('62', 101, 6, 18, 190838) Mahadev also has done that and is still doing it.
('62', 101, 6, 19, 190888) But, as the sun always carries its shadow as it moves, so also is the shadow always followed by light.
('62', 101, 6, 20, 190991) Similarly, Mahadev finds peace of mind through something or the other.
('62', 101, 6, 21, 191062) That seems to be true about you also.
('62', 101, 6, 22, 191100) You get the company of good books, and now you have been permitted to get butter from outside.
('62', 101, 6, 23, 191195) What more could you want to keep you happy ?
('62', 101, 6, 24, 191240) You have imbibed over the last many years the teachings of the Gita that one should remain cheerful in all circumstances.
('62', 101, 6, 25, 191362) If, when the time to put that teaching into practice comes, we fail to do so, surely we would feel

('62', 102, 1, 2, 191530) ashamed of ourselves.
('62', 102, 1, 3, 191552) I, therefore, dont worry about you, con fident that you will certainly not fail in the test.
('62', 102, 1, 4, 191645) I even hope that you will pass with first class marks.
('62', 102, 1, 5, 191700) Kaka has undertaken a fast.
('62', 102, 1, 6, 191728) His vow was for a seven day fast.
('62', 102, 1, 7, 191762) It will end on the day after tomorrow, that is, on Thursday.
('62', 102, 1, 8, 191823) The fast is for the sake of .
('62', 102, 1, 9, 191853) 1 He is extremely cheerful.
('62', 102, 1, 10, 191881) The fast seems to have had no adverse effect on him.
('62', 102, 1, 11, 191934) Of course, there is bound to be some weakness.
('62', 102, 1, 12, 191981) He sleeps in the open air.
('62', 102, 1, 13, 192008) He gets good sleep.
('62', 102, 1, 14, 192028) He can drink plenty of water.
('62', 102, 1, 15, 192058) In that respect, he can do much better than I. Darbari, who regards himself as Kakas disciple, and Surendra attend on him.
('62', 102, 1, 16, 192181) You can, therefore, easily understand that he is being looked after very well.
('62', 102, 1, 17, 192260) Prabhudas works as his secretary.
('62', 102, 1, 18, 192294) He takes down a few letters which Kaka may wish to dictate, and reads to him from the Gita, the Upanishads, etc.
('62', 102, 1, 19, 192407) Swami also is here at present.
('62', 102, 1, 20, 192438) Kishorelal and Gomati arrived today.
('62', 102, 1, 21, 192475) The weather here is bound to be beautiful at this time of the year.
('62', 102, 1, 22, 192543) The Wardha Ashram has become a girls Ashram.
('62', 102, 1, 23, 192588) There are more than 40 girls staying here just now.
('62', 102, 1, 24, 192640) Lakshmi behn has been working extremely hard, and Dwarakanath helps her.
('62', 102, 1, 25, 192713) Recently, we have engaged a musician, but the prayers are conducted by Lakshmibehn herself.
('62', 102, 1, 26, 192805) I knew that she possessed a sweet voice, but I did not know that she knew nearly a hundred bhajans.
('62', 102, 1, 27, 192905) Two prayers, the evening prayers on Thursday and Friday, are conducted by Mathuri, 2 and Yoga 3 joins her in singing the ghazal on Thursday.
('62', 102, 1, 28, 193046) We celebrated Prabhudass marriage a few days ago.
('62', 102, 1, 29, 193096) The bride belongs to North India.
('62', 102, 1, 30, 193130) Her name is Amba.
('62', 102, 1, 31, 193148) She is in her 25th year.
('62', 102, 1, 32, 193173) The choice was Prabhudass own, and the discovery also was his.
('62', 102, 1, 33, 193236) Ambas simplicity surpasses Prabhudass.
('62', 102, 1, 34, 193275) She has plenty of courage, too.
('62', 102, 1, 35, 193307) Prabhudas is very happy.
('62', 102, 1, 36, 193332) The two will stay here at least as long as I am here.
('62', 102, 1, 37, 193386) My tour begins on the 8th.
('62', 102, 1, 38, 193413) Nobody, neither Kashi 4 nor Chhaganlal 5 nor any other relative or friend from outside, was invited for the marriage.
('62', 102, 1, 39, 193531) The bride also was accompanied by only six persons.
('62', 102, 1, 40, 193583) One can, therefore, say that this was the simplest wedding we have celebrated.
('62', 102, 1, 41, 193662) The marriage ceremony was performed by a priest from Wardha under the guidance of Kaka.
('62', 102, 2, 42, 193750) 1 The name has been omitted.
('62', 102, 2, 43, 193779) 2 Lakshmibehn Khares daugher.

('62', 103, 1, 2, 193925) Among the girls whom you know, Chandrakanta 1 also is here, and so is Vidya Hingorani.
('62', 103, 1, 3, 194012) She will stay here at least for a year.
('62', 103, 1, 4, 194052) Vinoba, as you know, stays in a village (of Harijans) about a mile from here.
('62', 103, 1, 5, 194130) But the moral responsibility for this girls Ashram is his.
('62', 103, 1, 6, 194189) Anandi, Babu and Bachu had come here with me, but they have returned now.
('62', 103, 1, 7, 194263) You will be surprised to know that the girls do not like to go to Sharda Mandir for education.They want arrangements to be made at home.
('62', 103, 1, 8, 194400) I am in search of suitable persons.
('62', 103, 1, 9, 194436) I dont think there will be any difficulty.
('62', 103, 1, 10, 194479) Besides them, there are Vanamala, Mohan, Mani and Bablo.
('62', 103, 1, 11, 194536) All of them live in the Harijan Childrens Ashram run by Anasuyabehn.
('62', 103, 1, 12, 194605) They went to it quite willingly.
('62', 103, 1, 13, 194638) Of course they find it a little difficult to get used to the food, etc.
('62', 103, 1, 14, 194710) The food for Harijan girls is bound to be quite simple, and they get very little milk and ghee, too.
('62', 103, 1, 15, 194811) If we insist on bringing up our children on food like theirs, they would soon grow thin.
('62', 103, 1, 16, 194900) I am, therefore, thinking what arrangement to make so that the children, even while they stay in that Ashram, may get proper food.
('62', 103, 1, 17, 195031) In the mean time, they somehow manage to get the food which they require.
('62', 103, 1, 18, 195105) Aminas children also are staying in this same Ashram.
('62', 103, 1, 19, 195159) Unlike our children, they feel perfectly at home there.
('62', 103, 1, 20, 195215) They play and enjoy themselves the whole day.
('62', 103, 1, 21, 195261) A munshi has been engaged to teach them the Koran and Urdu.
('62', 103, 1, 22, 195321) You must have heard that finally the [Sabarmati] Ashram was given over for Harijan work.
('62', 103, 1, 23, 195410) It has been decided to send Totaramji to the Ashram.
('62', 103, 1, 24, 195463) Hariprasad also will go there.
('62', 103, 1, 25, 195494) Both of them are here at present.
('62', 103, 1, 26, 195528) Pannalal 2 intends to start an independent dairy.
('62', 103, 1, 27, 195578) I have written to him to come here.
('62', 103, 1, 28, 195614) At present he is with Nanibehn 3 and Gangabehn 4
('62', 103, 2, 29, 195663) in Ahmedabad.
('62', 103, 2, 30, 195677) Our dairy is being run by Titus near the Kankaria lake under the supervision of Shankerlal 5. I think it is running very well.
('62', 103, 2, 31, 195804) We have no responsibility even for that.
('62', 103, 2, 32, 195845) I suppose you know that the Ashram and the Vidyapith libraries have been handed over to the Ahmedabad Municipality.

('62', 104, 1, 3, 196282) Ba is pre paring to reach the Mandir.
('62', 104, 1, 4, 196320) Manu is here.
('62', 104, 1, 5, 196334) Dhiru, Balabhadra and Indu may be said to have decided to stay on in Bhavnagar.
('62', 104, 1, 6, 196414) Dudhi behn also has been living there with her children.
('62', 104, 1, 7, 196471) Nila Naginis Sirius is in Sharda Mandir.

('62', 104, 15, 27, 197108) I see you have handed to the Press the two resignations 4. They should clear that air a bit.
('62', 104, 15, 28, 197201) I do not follow the Hindu Sabha activities.

('62', 105, 1, 3, 197551) 1 If you have any literature please pass it on to me.
('62', 105, 1, 4, 197605) I think that the nationalist Press so called or real has not welcomed its activities and has been known often to condemn it.
('62', 105, 1, 5, 197730) I do not know anything about the embargo on M. A. K. Azads book.
('62', 105, 1, 6, 197795) As to the Harijan activities, the complaint is wholly unjustified.
('62', 105, 1, 7, 197862) My conscience is absolutely clear.

('62', 105, 1, 17, 198520) What else could I do ?

('62', 105, 1, 19, 198631) I told him that if I felt convinced that the A.I.C.C. members desired discontinuance of C. D. and a council entry pro gramme, I would at once ask you to convene a meeting of A.I.C.C.I do not do so because I believe that the majority will insist on a C. D. programme and I do not want to invite the ordinance sword for it.
('62', 105, 1, 20, 198953) I have told him too that I would not resist any programme that the A.I.C.C. might want though I could not give my approval to the sus pension of C. D. I believe Kelkars 3 attitude to be honest and consis tent.
('62', 105, 1, 21, 199163) He frankly dislikes N. C. O. and C. D. He would not join the terrorists or whatever they may be called.

('62', 105, 1, 23, 199356) Hopeless inactivity is the worst of all and should be discountenanced.

('62', 106, 2, 4, 200037) 1 I have written to Dahyabhai.
('62', 106, 2, 5, 200068) I am not likely to publish anything as being your view.
('62', 106, 2, 6, 200124) With regard to the wires and cables which you have received, after informing the Major 2 write one sentence in your next letter to me to the following effect : On my behalf please thank through the Press all those who have sent letters and wires or cables of condolence. If the Major cannot pass that on his own, he should write to the I. G. and, if he passes it, we shall publish it .
('62', 106, 3, 7, 200510) Nariman was here yesterday.
('62', 106, 3, 8, 200538) He took a fairly long time with me and I readily gave it.
('62', 106, 3, 9, 200596) My warden 4 let me do that.

('62', 106, 3, 13, 200878) Kakas fast will end tomorrow.
('62', 106, 3, 14, 200908) He is cheerful.
('62', 106, 3, 15, 200924) He doesnt seem to have been visibly affected by the fast.
('62', 106, 3, 16, 200982) He doesnt feel a burning sensation [in passing urine] as I do.
('62', 106, 3, 17, 201045) He can drink plenty of water, no matter whether it is mixed with salt or soda or is hot or cold.
('62', 106, 3, 18, 201142) If God would grant me the same ability, I should even at this age like to improve upon Bhansali 5 performance.
('62', 106, 3, 19, 201253) I wouldnt mind if, in consequence, I became crazy like him.
('62', 106, 3, 20, 201313) He wears a codpiece of hessian suspended from a string of coir tied round his waist.
('62', 106, 3, 21, 201398) He eats mois tened flour and wanders about.
('62', 106, 3, 22, 201442) He reappears sometimes in the form of
('62', 106, 4, 23, 201480) 1 In his letter dated October 29, 1933 the addressee had said that he had informed friends that it would be improper for him as a satyagrahi to request Government to release him for performing the rites.

('62', 107, 1, 3, 201953) During the fast, [Kaka] also did some writing through dictation.
('62', 107, 1, 4, 202018) Prabhudas has become his honorary secretary and also recites from the Gita for him.
('62', 107, 1, 5, 202102) Since Prabhudas has been Kakas favourite disciple, the arrangement suits the latter very well.
('62', 107, 1, 6, 202197) Kishorelal and Gomati also arrived yesterday.
('62', 107, 1, 7, 202243) I was the cause of their coming.
('62', 107, 2, 8, 202276) Kaka has done his duty as friend and father to the best of his ability .
('62', 107, 2, 9, 202349) 2 continues to follow his own way in his inordinate pride.
('62', 107, 2, 10, 202408) But I have not given up hope of him.
('62', 107, 2, 11, 202445) I do believe, though, that his eyes will not open till he stumbles some day.
('62', 107, 2, 12, 202522) What you say is quite right.
('62', 107, 2, 13, 202551) A cowards wisdom wont carry him far.
('62', 107, 2, 14, 202588) On the contrary, if an insolent boy like .
('62', 107, 2, 15, 202631) 3who is always flying in the air, became wise, his wisdom would never desert him afterwards and would help him fearlessly to mount the gallows.
('62', 107, 2, 16, 202775) But that seems too good to come true.
('62', 107, 2, 17, 202813) I think Kaka will soon regain his strength.
('62', 107, 2, 18, 202857) Dont worry about him.
('62', 107, 2, 19, 202879) During the fast, I didnt let my knowledge as a quack rust, so that, over and above the spiritual benefit from the fast, his body has certainly benefited.
('62', 107, 2, 20, 203033) You did well in administering a powerful dose of medicine 4. .
('62', 107, 2, 21, 203096) and Pandya 5 .
('62', 107, 2, 22, 203111) But the effect of such medicines does not last long and their reactions are sometimes dangerous.
('62', 107, 2, 23, 203208) I am not saying this to criticize your medicine.
('62', 107, 2, 24, 203257) My only purpose is to draw your attention to the truth.
('62', 107, 2, 25, 203313) Mahadev writes to me regularly.
('62', 107, 2, 26, 203345) He has been collecting books from all sources.
('62', 107, 2, 27, 203392) I suppose one day all those books will go to a public library.
('62', 107, 2, 28, 203455) I hope he doesnt go blind in jail through excessive reading.
('62', 107, 2, 29, 203516) I do intend to send him a mildly worded prohibitory order.
('62', 107, 2, 30, 203575) Dr. Datta visited Devdas [in jail].
('62', 107, 2, 31, 203611) The latter seems to be making good use of his time.
('62', 107, 2, 32, 203663) He reads, teaches, plays games and spins.
('62', 107, 2, 33, 203705) My programme is as follows : Up to the end of this month, the C. P., then Delhi, then the Punjab, then Sind, then Rajputana, then the U. P., Bengal, Assam, etc.
('62', 107, 2, 34, 203866) This is the plan at present.
('62', 107, 2, 35, 203895) But it is not impossible that there may be some change in this programme and I may go to Madras earlier.
('62', 107, 2, 36, 204000) I shall be leaving this
('62', 107, 3, 37, 204024) 1 Omission as in the source 2 The names are omitted in the source.

('62', 108, 1, 4, 204432) I will write to Deodhar regarding your letter.
('62', 108, 1, 5, 204479) Rajendrababu has again been removed to a hospital.
('62', 108, 1, 6, 204530) I think he will now be kept there for some time.

('62', 108, 6, 11, 204693) WARDHA, November 1, 1933 CHI.
('62', 108, 6, 12, 204723) MATHURADAS, I have your letter.
('62', 108, 6, 13, 204755) I had a long talk with Nariman.
('62', 108, 6, 14, 204787) I let him also have my answer to the question in your last sentence, that my desire to give up leadership has not weakened the least bit.
('62', 108, 6, 15, 204925) On the contrary, it is becoming stronger and stronger.
('62', 108, 6, 16, 204980) But it cannot be given up just like that.
('62', 108, 6, 17, 205022) For I had hardly spoken when Nariman remarked that I was issuing a threat.
('62', 108, 6, 18, 205097) I have got the impression that Nariman would not like to enter the Municipality by opposing the Bill.
('62', 108, 6, 19, 205199) We then talked about many other things.
('62', 108, 6, 20, 205239) I shall not take up your time by going over them.
('62', 108, 6, 21, 205289) Gosibehn and Jamnabehn are here.
('62', 108, 6, 22, 205322) Andrews is coming today.

('62', 109, 3, 4, 205729) H. E. THE GOVERNOR OF BENGAL CALCUTTA
('62', 109, 4, 5, 205767) DEAR FRIEND, Though I have not the honour to enjoy personal acquintance with you, I had the good fortune to know you through Sir Samuel Hoare when I was in London in 1931. On the strength of that intro duction, I venture to share the enclosed 1 with you.
('62', 109, 4, 6, 206022) It is a letter from an esteemed worker.
('62', 109, 4, 7, 206062) It speaks for itself.
('62', 109, 4, 8, 206084) I have the hope that proceedings described therein could not possibly meet with your approval.
('62', 109, 4, 9, 206179) The civil resister of whom mention is made in the letter is the writers brother.
('62', 109, 4, 10, 206260) No doubt a civil resister is out for suffering, but I should think that, according to the standard apparently accepted today, all methods of torture would be avoided by Governments claiming to be civilized.
('62', 109, 4, 11, 206467) I shall feel thankful to know that you have personally interested yourself in the case I have ventured to bring to your notice.
('62', 109, 6, 12, 206595) Yours sincerely,

('62', 109, 10, 17, 206731) November 2, 1933
('62', 109, 11, 18, 206748) CONGER : Is the hand of God behind good only, or is it behind evil also ?
('62', 109, 12, 19, 206822) GANDHIJI : It is behind good, but in Gods hand it is not mere good.
('62', 109, 12, 20, 206890) His hand is behind evil also, but there it is no longer evil.
('62', 109, 13, 21, 206952) 1 In his letters dated October 27 and 28 Satis Chandra Das Gupta had described the inhuman treatment meted out to his brother Kshitish Chandra Das Gupta and other persons in Hijli Jail for their refusal to salaam the jail authorities.
('62', 109, 13, 22, 207187) 2 This is reported by Chandrashankar Shukla who was at the time working as Secretary to Gandhiji and had kept notes of the interview which was later reproduced in his book Conversations with Mahatma Gandhi
('62', 110, 0, 1, 207393) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 111
('62', 110, 1, 2, 207440) Good and evil are our own imperfect language.
('62', 110, 1, 3, 207486) God is above both good and evil.
('62', 110, 2, 4, 207519) Q. There is Gods will behind every one of our action, is it not ?
('62', 110, 2, 5, 207585) A. Even allowing that there is His will behind every action, man can say that certain things God allows, wills or prohibits.
('62', 110, 2, 6, 207710) All this is taken to mean His will.
('62', 110, 3, 7, 207746) Q. You said there was Gods inspiration behind your twenty one days fast.
('62', 110, 4, 8, 207819) have also spoken of wrestling.
('62', 110, 4, 9, 207850) What exactly do you mean to convey ?
('62', 110, 4, 10, 207887) A. These are the babblings of an imperfect man.
('62', 110, 4, 11, 207935) Mans wrestling with God is like that of an infants wrestling with the mother.
('62', 110, 4, 12, 208013) The infant does wrestle with the mother; and when the mother gives it a feed the infant says : I wrested it from her.
('62', 110, 5, 13, 208131) Here Gandhiji gave the dictionary meanings of the words wrestle and wrest.
('62', 110, 5, 14, 208206) Similarly God, when He parts with something, does so with plea sure, if God has pleasure and pain.
('62', 110, 5, 15, 208305) A man who surrenders everything at His feet says to Him : I will die, if you dont give me a certain thing..
('62', 110, 5, 16, 208413) He defies and challenges God.
('62', 110, 5, 17, 208443) In millions of examples God lets such men reach the point of death.
('62', 110, 5, 18, 208511) Then we say that He has thoroughly tested the man.
('62', 110, 5, 19, 208562) That, however, is our own feeling.
('62', 110, 5, 20, 208597) If man can somehow know Gods way of putting things, I dont know what He would say.
('62', 110, 5, 21, 208680) We foolish beings think that we have exhausted our strength in wrestling with Him.
('62', 110, 5, 22, 208763) With God there is neither wrestling nor wresting.
('62', 110, 5, 23, 208813) If God is just, He would not torture His devotee.
('62', 110, 6, 24, 208863) Q. Is God just or not ?
('62', 110, 6, 25, 208887) A. God is just.
('62', 110, 6, 26, 208903) Rather, He is not jut but merciful.
('62', 110, 6, 27, 208939) He is just because He is merciful.These, however, are echoes of our own weak feeling.
('62', 110, 6, 28, 209025) Man also sometimes talks of giving God His due.
('62', 110, 6, 29, 209073) But what can a slave give to the Master ?
('62', 110, 6, 30, 209115) In relation to God man is always a debtor, and never a creditor.
('62', 110, 7, 31, 209180) Q. Is faith necessary or effort ?
('62', 110, 7, 32, 209214) A. Really both faith and effort are necessary.
('62', 110, 8, 33, 209261) Q. Has man got a choice ?
('62', 110, 8, 34, 209287) A. Man has got a choice, but as much of it as a passenger on board a ship has.
('62', 110, 8, 35, 209366) It is just enough for him.
('62', 110, 8, 36, 209393) If we dont use it, then we are practically dead.
('62', 110, 9, 37, 209442) Q. God has a purpose which He is working out in the world, is it not ?
('62', 111, 0, 1, 209513) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 112
('62', 111, 1, 2, 209555) A. I qualify the statement by saying that this is human speech.
('62', 111, 1, 3, 209619) I dont know Gods purpose, because I am not God.
('62', 111, 1, 4, 209667) I am a man.
('62', 111, 1, 5, 209679) I therefore try to comprehend God and His purpose not through speech but through life.
('62', 111, 1, 6, 209766) I cannot deal with the hundreds of thousands of beings in the universe as a unit.
('62', 111, 1, 7, 209848) I cannot enter into the heart of every one of them, because they are infinite in number.
('62', 111, 1, 8, 209937) But God is all powerful.
('62', 111, 1, 9, 209962) Just as He has a purpose for the universe as a unit, He has a purpose for every particle of life toofor man as well as the ant.
('62', 111, 2, 10, 210090) Q. Is it a good purpose ?
('62', 111, 2, 11, 210116) A. It is a good purposebut good in the way of our limited human speech.

('62', 111, 4, 14, 210263) DISTRESS IN ROHTAK, PUNJAB 1
('62', 111, 5, 15, 210292) This is a tale of distress that ought to move philanthropists to action.
('62', 111, 5, 16, 210365) Any contributions sent to the Editor, Harijan, 8 c, Pycrofts Road, Triplicane, Madras, will be acknowledged and forwarded the proper quarters.
('62', 111, 6, 17, 210508) THE FORTHCOMING TOUR How would the collections, made during the forthcoming tour, be distributed ? is the question put by several workers.
('62', 111, 6, 18, 210647) They will be handed to the Central Board with instructions to use them as far as may be for the province or the district or the taluk or the town, in which they may be collected.
('62', 111, 6, 19, 210826) Whilst this will be the general rule, I do contemplate receiving in some places large single donations which will be utilized for the Harijan cause wherever the need is the greatest.
('62', 111, 6, 20, 211009) It must be obvious that any rigid rule restricting the use of collections to the places where they are collected will defeat the very end of workers or donors for fear of the collections not being used in their districts or in the best manner possible.
('62', 111, 6, 21, 211262) They should realize that the Central Board has an efficient system of account keeping, that accounts are audited
('62', 111, 7, 22, 211375) 1 This was appended to Amritlal V.

('62', 112, 2, 3, 211741) HIS LOVE FOR HARIJANS 1
('62', 112, 3, 4, 211765) In the hasty tribute 2 I paid to the memory of Vithalbhai Patel, I omitted to mention the unforgettable scene I witnessed at the Harijan quarters in Godhra, which place I visited in 1917 3 for its political conference.
('62', 112, 3, 5, 211984) There was a Harijan conference, too, held at the time, and I had invited the audience to come to the Harijan quarters and hold the conference there, if they were sincere in their professions.
('62', 112, 3, 6, 212176) 4 Whom should I see there if not Vithalbhai Patel, who was then a member of the Legislative Council, dressed in the peasant garb with a Sadhus topi on his head ?
('62', 112, 3, 7, 212338) 5 He mixed with the Harijans with the greatest free dom and I know that he evinced the greatest interest in the Harijan cause.
('62', 112, 3, 8, 212465) With him the sweeper was as good as any other person, no matter what his caste might be.
('62', 112, 3, 9, 212554) He never concealed his opinion or practice in order to please the orthodox.
('62', 112, 3, 10, 212630) Let me hope that on the 9th instant, when the last rites are performed, Harijan tears will freely mingle with those of the multitude who will pay homage to the memory of the deceased patriot.

('62', 112, 4, 12, 212841) 128. THE CRY OF ORISSA
('62', 112, 5, 13, 212864) In the morning of the 17th inst.
('62', 112, 5, 14, 212897) (October), we went to Khandayta.
('62', 112, 5, 15, 212930) Here the rushing waters had broken through the banks and for miles and miles a new river had come into being, destroying many a home.
('62', 112, 5, 16, 213064) Very few houses appeared to be standing.
('62', 112, 5, 17, 213105) The Marwadi Society has carried on operations here.
('62', 112, 6, 18, 213157) 1 A similar article in Gujarati appeared in Harijanbandhu, 5 11 1933. 2 Vide Letter to Janakdhari Prasad, 25 10 1933 3 The source has 1916. Gandhiji had visited Godhra in November 1917; vide Speech at Gujarat Political Conference I, 3 11 1917 4 The Gujarati version here has the following additional sentences : And for the first time in the history of Godhra, the Harijan colony was crowded with caste Hindus.
('62', 112, 6, 19, 213568) The place overflowed with people.
('62', 112, 6, 20, 213602) Abbas Saheb and his wife were no doubt there. 5 The Gujarati version here adds : As I had never seen Vithalbhai in this dress, I could not recognize him immediately.
('62', 112, 6, 21, 213768) But when I did, we heartily embraced each other and had a hearty laugh.
('62', 112, 6, 22, 213840) No doubt Vithalbhai had deliberately donned this dress but it also shows his simplicity and readiness to mix with people.
('62', 113, 0, 1, 213962) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 114
('62', 113, 1, 2, 214004) has been feeding 3,500 persons from 25 villages and doling out 7 seers (1 1 2 seers of Cuttack is equal to 4 lb.) of rice per month
('62', 113, 2, 3, 214136) per head and one cotton sheet, and husk for cattle.
('62', 113, 2, 4, 214188) Thus the Society has distributed Rs. 5,000 among these.
('62', 113, 2, 5, 214244) At another centre, the Society has been giving relief to 5,700 people from 27 villages; each person gets here 26 tolas of rice.
('62', 113, 2, 6, 214372) There is a big rush even for this little dole.
('62', 113, 2, 7, 214419) There are two central depots in Cuttack and two in Puri.
('62', 113, 2, 8, 214476) Nearly Rs. 15,000 have been spent there.
('62', 113, 2, 9, 214517) From Khandayta we went to Khadarda.
('62', 113, 2, 10, 214553) Half the number of houses belonging to Harijans have been razed to the ground.
('62', 113, 2, 11, 214632) Those that remained have become dilapidated.
('62', 113, 2, 12, 214677) There we saw a woman only half clad and in perfect destitution.
('62', 113, 2, 13, 214741) She com plained of want of work.
('62', 113, 2, 14, 214774) In a house nearby, we saw a sister lying on the damp floor and suffering from high fever.
('62', 113, 2, 15, 214864) These people will need clothes against the approaching cold weather.
('62', 113, 2, 16, 214933) From Khadarda we went to Jharpada.
('62', 113, 2, 17, 214968) There we saw eight volunteers working under most difficult circumstances.
('62', 113, 2, 18, 215042) They distributed medical relief among ailing people and they had rigged up a king of accommodation for admitting very bad cases.
('62', 113, 2, 19, 215171) You can imagine what sort of nursing these poor patients can get.
('62', 113, 2, 20, 215237) Here 4 lb.
('62', 113, 2, 21, 215248) of rice (costing six pice) per week are issued to adults.
('62', 113, 2, 22, 215306) Half the rations are doled out to minors.
('62', 113, 2, 23, 215348) Those who are able bodied get nothing.
('62', 113, 2, 24, 215387) Therefore relief is confined prin cipally to women and children.
('62', 113, 2, 25, 215452) I cannot imagine at the present moment a better use for the money of those who are charitably inclined.
('62', 113, 2, 26, 215556) You should not imagine that anything like adequate relief is being given.
('62', 113, 2, 27, 215630) More depots could be opened if there was more money.
('62', 113, 2, 28, 215683) It is possible to make the best use of 40 to 50 thousand rupees per month, for, even at the rate of 8 as.
('62', 113, 2, 29, 215789) per month, out of half a lakh of rupees only one lakh persons can be reached, and the number affected is surely larger.
('62', 113, 2, 30, 215909) I have translated certain extracts from letters received from Sjt.
('62', 113, 2, 31, 215976) Harak[h] chand Motichand, who has been specially sent to Orissa in order to help the local Flood Relief Committee, of which Deena bandhu Andrews has accepted the Chairmanship.
('62', 113, 2, 32, 216152) Thakkar Bapa rebukes me, and he has every right to do so, by saying: Thakkar Bapa has to be pardoned for forgetting that notice of the marriage was necessary in the interest of the Harijan cause.
('62', 113, 3, 33, 216348) How can you close the columns of the Harijan to the distress of the
('62', 114, 0, 1, 216416) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 115
('62', 114, 1, 2, 216463) people who are sorely affected by the flood ?
('62', 114, 1, 3, 216509) They are no better of than Harijans.
('62', 114, 1, 4, 216546) And if you will plead only for those who are labelled as Harijan, even so there are thousands of these labelled ones also.
('62', 114, 1, 5, 216669) Surely, if you can give some space to a description of the Devdas Lakshmi marriage, you ought to take notice of the distress amongst the flood stricken people of Orissa.
('62', 114, 1, 6, 216839) You have already issued a moving appeal for Orissa.
('62', 114, 1, 7, 216891) To open the columns of the Harijan to periodical descriptions of the effects of the Orissa floods is but a logical extension of what you have done.
('62', 114, 1, 8, 217039) But love is blind.
('62', 114, 1, 9, 217058) And he is a lover of humanity in distress, no matter in what quarter of the globe that humanity is to be found.
('62', 114, 1, 10, 217170) His love is limited only by the limits that God Almighty has prescribed.
('62', 114, 1, 11, 217243) Therefore, he exclaims : See what my workers got the other day for my Bhils in the Panch Mahals.
('62', 114, 1, 12, 217340) Why cant you get much more for the more numerous population of a whole province ? He is right.
('62', 114, 1, 13, 217435) And in all humanity I make this appeal to whomsoever may see it.
('62', 114, 1, 14, 217500) There is no doubt the distress.
('62', 114, 1, 15, 217532) I have always held that Orissa is the most helpless and the poorest province of India.
('62', 114, 1, 16, 217619) Thousands of pilgrims visit the ancient temple of Puri for acquiring merit.
('62', 114, 1, 17, 217695) Hundreds among them are rich enough to satisfy the hunger of the hungry and clothe the naked.
('62', 114, 1, 18, 217789) Times are not doubt bad.
('62', 114, 1, 19, 217814) That is just the opportunity for the moneyed people to deny themselves many things they have hither to held necessary for their comfort or enjoyment and establish their right to the wealth God has blessed them with, by unstintingly helping the helpless.
('62', 114, 1, 20, 218068) Somehow or other, ever since my return to India in 1915, Orissa has been to me an epitome of Indias distressful helplessness.
('62', 114, 1, 21, 218194) The Bombay Committee is there, but I must tell the citizens that their res ponse is very poor.
('62', 114, 1, 22, 218289) At the time of writing I find that only Rs. 12,000 have been subscribed by Bombay.
('62', 114, 1, 23, 218372) I cannot recall an instance when Bombay had pleaded bad times in the face of hunger and nakedness.
('62', 114, 1, 24, 218471) Bombay has felt uneasy in its cinemas and theatres, with the cry for help ringing in the ears of her citizens.
('62', 114, 1, 25, 218582) Let them not do less now than they have done before.
('62', 114, 1, 26, 218635) And why should not wealthy people of the other parts of India wake up and vie with Bombay in catholic charity ?
('62', 114, 1, 27, 218747) Any money sent to the Editor, Harijan, at 8 C, Pycrofts Road, Tripli cane, Madras, will be acknowledged in these columns and forwarded to the proper quarters.

('62', 115, 1, 2, 218967) 129. TWO CRUEL CASES
('62', 115, 2, 3, 218988) The record of steady progress reported from week to week in these pages is perhaps more than balanced by the revelations of inhu manity towards Harijans that come to light from time to time.
('62', 115, 2, 4, 219179) At a village called Samarkha in the district of Kheda, Gujarat, the caste villagers are reported to have burnt the crops of Christian Harijans because one or more of them had the courage to draw water from a public well.
('62', 115, 2, 5, 219400) The case is now said to be pending before the Courts.
('62', 115, 2, 6, 219454) In the village of Dholka, in Ahmedabad District, caste men are reported to have horsewhipped some Harijans, two of them seriously because one of them had the temerity to bathe in a public tank.
('62', 115, 2, 7, 219648) These are not the only cases of their kind.
('62', 115, 2, 8, 219692) They are serious enough to have seen the light of day.
('62', 115, 2, 9, 219747) We have no knowledge of the many petty assaults committed upon innocent Harijans for the exer cise of human rights recognized by law.
('62', 115, 2, 10, 219881) These cases should open the eyes of sanatanists.
('62', 115, 2, 11, 219930) I have not known a single sanatanist defend such inhumanity.
('62', 115, 2, 12, 219991) Let them either co operate with the the reformers or act separately, but effectively, in preventing or dealing with such occurrences.
('62', 115, 2, 13, 220125) The duty before workers is clear.
('62', 115, 2, 14, 220159) They may not hesitate to take such cases to court, when it becomes necessary.
('62', 115, 2, 15, 220237) But, before so doing, they should make every attempt to bring the wrongdoers to a sense of the wrong done and to induce the to make adequate reparation.
('62', 115, 2, 16, 220390) I imagine that this can be done, if, for instance in the case of Samarkha, well known men and women from Nadiad or even Ahmedabad, if necessary, went to the village and reasoned with the wrongdoers who have inherited the habit of thinkng that caste Hindus may deal with Harijans as if they were mere chattels and not human beings.
('62', 115, 2, 17, 220721) This dark ignorance of the elementary rights of human beings can be dispelled by the light of public opinion playing upon the darkness.
('62', 115, 2, 18, 220857) I hope no Hindu thinks that he need not concern himself in the case of Christian Harijans.
('62', 115, 2, 19, 220948) These have surely the same rights with Hindu Harijans to public activities that caste men have.
('62', 115, 2, 20, 221044) If the latter do not want to make use of public institutions, it is open to them at their own expense to erect others, for their exclusive use.
('62', 115, 2, 21, 221188) Sects and communities do build separate schools and hospitals for themselves out of funds they themselves subscribe.
('62', 115, 2, 22, 221305) No one takes exception to these.
('62', 115, 2, 23, 221338) But no one has the right to prevent anyone else from using what belongs to the general public.
('62', 115, 2, 24, 221433) And then, it should be remembered that Christian

('62', 116, 1, 2, 221529) Harijans are our own creation.
('62', 116, 1, 3, 221560) The evil of untouchability has spread in quarters wholly unexpected.
('62', 116, 1, 4, 221629) We may not wince if now we have to pay the penalty for having harboured the evil for untold generations.

('62', 116, 3, 6, 221753) 130. NO NEED FOR A TANNERY ?
('62', 116, 4, 7, 221782) A correspondent has raised the following question :
('62', 116, 5, 8, 221834) I can understand the removal of the offices of the Provincial or Central Board of the Servants of Untouchables Society to the Ashram donated for Harijan use.
('62', 116, 5, 9, 221992) I can also understand the hostel scheme and the one for establishing a Harijan colony.
('62', 116, 5, 10, 222079) But a tannery does not fit in, and if a tannery should be there, why not also a department for teaching scavenging and sanitation; for, it is as much a Harijan work as tanning ?
('62', 116, 5, 11, 222257) The fallacy of the argument lies in misunderstanding the pur pose of the proposed tannery.
('62', 116, 5, 12, 222348) It is that tanning should be a great national industry.
('62', 116, 5, 13, 222404) The leather constitutes an immense business, and instead of exporting raw hide, we should keep it in India and manufacture the various things we need.
('62', 116, 5, 14, 222555) It must mean a great addition to the wealth of the country.
('62', 116, 5, 15, 222615) Now tens of thousands of Harijans are engaged in tanning.
('62', 116, 5, 16, 222673) It is an honourable profession and a lucrative business, and can be much more lucrative if it is well organized.
('62', 116, 5, 17, 222786) But the tanning done in the villages is of the crudest type.
('62', 116, 5, 18, 222847) Moreover, all the processes are not performed in a hygienic or scientific manner.
('62', 116, 5, 19, 222929) If they were performed in a scientific manner, there would be no prejudices against cattle skinning and tanning as they exist today.
('62', 116, 5, 20, 223062) The idea, therefore, behind having a technological department at the new institution is to give dignity to the occupation, purging it of all crudeness and uncleanness.
('62', 116, 5, 21, 223230) Then, again, it is not as if only Harijans will be doing the work.
('62', 116, 5, 22, 223297) They will be doing it side by side with non Harijans.
('62', 116, 5, 23, 223351) No one will be forced to learn it and no one can dare suggest that no Harijan tanner would want to learn the scientific or the cleaner method.
('62', 116, 5, 24, 223494) Lastly, the reference to the technological department is merely by way of illustration.
('62', 116, 5, 25, 223582) If all goes well, there will be many other departments opened including even one for exploring the best method of rendering sanitary service in which all can take part.
('62', 116, 5, 26, 223751) Our indifference towards it has resulted in the increase of diseases and in insanitary habits becoming confirmed.
('62', 116, 5, 27, 223865) I am hoping that there will be no trade or profession neglected which can be of benefit to the Harijans, whether it has been hitherto followed by them or not.

('62', 117, 3, 4, 224160) MY DEAR AGATHA, I enclose herewith a copy of my letter 1 to the Governor of Bengal.
('62', 117, 3, 5, 224244) Satis Chandra Das Gupta, the author of the enclosures to the Governors letter, is a valued and well known co worker.
('62', 117, 3, 6, 224361) His non violence is deep rooted, not at all superficial, and one of the truest of men it has been my good fortune to meet.
('62', 117, 3, 7, 224484) He first came to know of the Hijli Jail practice when he understood that his brother who is a civil resister was given standing hand cuffs.
('62', 117, 3, 8, 224624) Bar fetters are different from hand cuffs.
('62', 117, 3, 9, 224667) Bar fetters are meant for the legs.
('62', 117, 3, 10, 224703) At the present moment I am not resorting to any public agita tion in connection with the things that come under my observation.
('62', 117, 3, 11, 224831) I pass them on to the authorities.
('62', 117, 3, 12, 224866) Therefore, unless I tell you to the contrary, all such correspondence should not be published at your end either.
('62', 117, 3, 13, 224980) Apart from this, there is no restriction upon the use to be made by you of such information.
('62', 117, 3, 14, 225073) I send you also a copy of a note received from the Frontier Province.
('62', 117, 3, 15, 225143) That discloses a tale far worse than the treatment in the Hijli Jail as disclosed in Sjt.
('62', 117, 3, 16, 225233) Satisbabus letter to me.
('62', 117, 3, 17, 225258) Naturally, nobody can vouch for the accuracy of the information from the Frontier Province.
('62', 117, 3, 18, 225350) But, after the revelations made by Father Elwin, it would not surprise me if the note is found to be an under statement.
('62', 117, 3, 19, 225471) The note has just come to me, and I have not yet decided what use I should make of it here.

('62', 119, 6, 12, 227862) [Before November 5, 1933] WHAT IS THE LEAST WE CAN DO ?
('62', 119, 7, 13, 227918) One can have attachment even for service.
('62', 119, 7, 14, 227960) True service can be rendered only by giving up all attachments.
('62', 119, 7, 15, 228024) Cannot the weak and the infirm worship God ?
('62', 119, 7, 16, 228069) One can serve even mentally.
('62', 119, 7, 17, 228098) You can take a couple of Harijan girls into your household and bring them up.
('62', 119, 7, 18, 228176) INSTRUCTIONS TO A YOUNG MAN 3
('62', 119, 8, 19, 228206) Live on milk, chapati and boiled greens.
('62', 119, 8, 20, 228247) Give up chillies and spices.
('62', 119, 8, 21, 228276) Take moderate exercise in the open.
('62', 119, 8, 22, 228312) Engage yourself in nation building activities and go on repeating Ramanama.
('62', 119, 8, 23, 228388) If you do this, you may be able to overcome wet dreams.
('62', 119, 8, 24, 228444) HOW TO CURE THIS DISEASE ?
('62', 119, 9, 25, 228471) I am sure your disease can be cured.
('62', 119, 9, 26, 228508) You must give up rich food and medicines.
('62', 119, 9, 27, 228550) If you spend your time outside the house in the open, live on fresh milk, fresh fruit, greens and chapatis, take moderate exercise within the limit of your strength, avoid reading exciting literature and do not go to films and plays, you can be cured of your disease.
('62', 119, 10, 28, 228818) HOW TO CONCENTRATE ?
('62', 119, 10, 29, 228839) The best way of acquiring concentration is to be absorbed in whatever physical work you may be engaged in.
('62', 119, 10, 30, 228946) And one is bound to get absorbed in it if one tries to do it to the best of ones ability.
('62', 119, 11, 31, 229036) 1 This appeared under the title From the Mail bag.
('62', 119, 11, 32, 229087) 2 This was addressed to a woman in poor health who felt unhappy because she wished to but could not serve Harijans.

('62', 120, 1, 2, 229304) Among the names of God, that one will be most useful to us to which we are accustomed.
('62', 120, 1, 3, 229391) I myself love Ramanama.
('62', 120, 2, 4, 229415) WHAT IS INNER VOICE ?
('62', 120, 3, 5, 229437) What you say is logically correct.
('62', 120, 3, 6, 229472) But if one does not have a clear idea as to what the inner voice means, the principle cannot be followed in practice.
('62', 120, 3, 7, 229590) I believe that the inner voice is perfect knowledge or realization of the Truth.
('62', 120, 3, 8, 229671) And because we do not see perfect Truth, because the truth that we see is imperfect, we look upon the seers of the world as our guides and follow them.
('62', 120, 3, 9, 229823) Definite rules have been laid down to help us realize truth, and we can know Truth only by following them.
('62', 120, 3, 10, 229930) Hence, just as we cannot know geometry without studying it , so also it is not possible for anybody to hear the inner voice without the necessary effort and training.
('62', 120, 3, 11, 230097) Hence, accor ding to my definition, a murderer cannot cite the inner voice in defence of his act.
('62', 120, 4, 12, 230195) LIMITATIONS OF A FAST 2
('62', 120, 5, 13, 230219) I am firmly of the view that no one should resort to a fast for personal benefit.
('62', 120, 5, 14, 230301) If everyone started fasting against others for redress of his or her grievances, there would be chaos in public life.
('62', 120, 5, 15, 230419) This friend, therefore, should be persuaded to give up his fast.
('62', 120, 6, 16, 230484) THINK OF THE MILLIONS 3
('62', 120, 7, 17, 230508) A person who follows the path of dharma does not feel helpless.
('62', 120, 7, 18, 230572) One should not incur debt and spend money on medicines.
('62', 120, 7, 19, 230628) If you compare yourself with the vast millions, you will see that your financial condition is a thousand times better than theirs.
('62', 120, 7, 20, 230759) If you culti vate strength to endure your financial hardships, all your sufferings will change into happiness.
('62', 120, 7, 21, 230870) Of the eight persons, whoever can do physical labour should do it.

('62', 120, 8, 23, 230978) 1 This was in reply to a correspondent who had asked whether everybody would not follow Gandhijis example and claim inner voice in justification of all his actions, good or bad.
('62', 120, 8, 24, 231156) 2 This was addressed to a man whose friend had lost his job and had gone on a fast to get it back.

('62', 121, 1, 2, 231401) 136. A WORKERS PROBLEM
('62', 121, 2, 3, 231424) A worker serving the Harijan has sent a double stringed necklace made of gold, rudraksha and coral along with Rs. 13 8 0 which he had received on the occasion of his maternal uncles shraddha.
('62', 121, 2, 4, 231616) In an accompanying note the gentleman says.
('62', 121, 3, 5, 231660) The short and the straight reply to this is that one should not in the first place act against ones principles in order to please anybody.
('62', 121, 3, 6, 231799) Once it becomes clear to us that what we are being persuaded to do is against our principle, there should be no question of giving in to anyones importunity.
('62', 121, 3, 7, 231957) But I know this reply will not satisfy my correspondent.
('62', 121, 3, 8, 232014) There is only one root cause of all human failings and that is our lack of faith in God.
('62', 121, 3, 9, 232103) Chanting His name or visiting temples, etc., as a matter of convention is no sign of our faith in God, but rather a symptom of lethargy or mental weakness.
('62', 121, 3, 10, 232259) Faith in God ought to be a matter of the heart.
('62', 121, 3, 11, 232307) And one who has it should find no need to satisfy another.
('62', 121, 3, 12, 232366) He who has satisfied God has triumphed; and, he who has not known him may please thousands, but is lost for ever inasmuch as he has to deny himself in trying to please one person after another.
('62', 121, 3, 13, 232560) God is the soul within, because He pervades every single atom.
('62', 121, 3, 14, 232623) And this is not only a belief but an established fact.
('62', 121, 3, 15, 232678) Some know Him as Nature rather than by the name of God.
('62', 121, 3, 16, 232734) Some know Him as the great Power.
('62', 121, 3, 17, 232768) Even modern scientists concede that there is a power hidden in each atom which sustains the universe.
('62', 121, 3, 18, 232870) Anyone who acts in subservience to this great Power will never be wanting in strength.
('62', 121, 3, 19, 232957) His will power will grow day after day.
('62', 121, 3, 20, 232997) It is well known that those experienced in the ways of the world have shown the means by which this force can be demons trated.
('62', 121, 3, 21, 233125) This power cannot but become manifest in anyone who adopts them.
('62', 121, 3, 22, 233190) As the Harijanbandhu has already referred to them 2 they need not be repeated here.

('62', 122, 2, 3, 233604) Bhai Gokuldas Khimji of Mandvi, Kutch, is a well known social and Harijan worker.
('62', 122, 2, 4, 233686) Writing about him a gentleman says that when I had gone to Kutch I had compared him to the docile cow.
('62', 122, 2, 5, 233789) I remember that occasion.
('62', 122, 2, 6, 233815) Gokuldas is indeed humble.
('62', 122, 2, 7, 233842) He serves wherever he can.
('62', 122, 2, 8, 233869) he just would not hurt anyone.
('62', 122, 2, 9, 233900) He has written to Bhai Parikshitlal, Secretary, Gujarat Anti untouchability League, as follows : 1
('62', 122, 3, 10, 233999) In this case, victory lies with the person who has been beaten up and not with those who beat him up.
('62', 122, 3, 11, 234101) The beating up of such humble workers as Gokuldas will generate a spiritual energy which will melt the core of caste Hindus and release the Harijans from bondage.
('62', 122, 3, 12, 234264) The saner sanatanist Hindus of Kutch ought to make efforts to stop such rowdyism.
('62', 122, 3, 13, 234346) Even if untouchability were dharma, it can be protected by spiritual strength.
('62', 122, 3, 14, 234425) I do not know if it was ever safeguarded by brute force.

('62', 122, 7, 18, 234556) WARDHA, November 5, 1933
('62', 122, 8, 19, 234581) MY DEAR FRIEND, I like your letter.
('62', 122, 8, 20, 234617) It is full of love for Anand and Vidya.
('62', 122, 8, 21, 234657) No doubt they are both sentimental.
('62', 122, 8, 22, 234693) But they are both good as gold.
('62', 122, 8, 23, 234725) You have every reason to be proud of them.
('62', 122, 8, 24, 234768) I like, too, your idea of find ing constructive service for both of them.
('62', 122, 8, 25, 234842) But in this desire of yours I detect an excess of affection.
('62', 122, 8, 26, 234903) I plead for restraint.
('62', 122, 8, 27, 234926) Anands soul will be injured, if he is made or induced to break the sacred pro mise made to God.
('62', 122, 8, 28, 235022) You do not need my assurance that Anand adores both you and your noble wife.
('62', 122, 8, 29, 235099) He would love to do anything to win your approbation and blessings.
('62', 122, 8, 30, 235167) It would be wrong to exploit parent worship for weakening him.
('62', 122, 8, 31, 235230) Therefore for the time being let him do the things he has promised to God to do.
('62', 122, 8, 32, 235311) He will be safe.
('62', 122, 8, 33, 235328) God will take care of him.

('62', 124, 6, 11, 237287) DEAR DR.
('62', 124, 6, 12, 237296) HARDIKAR 2, I have read your long letter to Jamnalalji and had a long chat with Sharma.
('62', 124, 6, 13, 237384) I have gone into the figures and have shown him how the budget should be reduced.
('62', 124, 6, 14, 237466) I have no time to reiterate the reasons.
('62', 124, 6, 15, 237507) In my view at the present moment and for one year your wants should not exceed Rs. 5,000. From Jalbhais letter it appears that Rs. 4,000 can easily be found.
('62', 124, 6, 16, 237665) A loan is needed for the balance.
('62', 124, 6, 17, 237699) But I have advised a donation rather than a loan, and it may be Rs. 2,000. So, if Jalbhai has difficulty in finding Rs. 4,000 and if you regulate your expenditure according to my revision, you should have no difficulty for the current year.
('62', 124, 6, 18, 237940) Fresh effort will be necessary for the next year.
('62', 124, 6, 19, 237990) But I think that the workers should be told that they may not expect any guarantee regarding the maintenance money.
('62', 124, 6, 20, 238106) I have adopted this method for all the workers.
('62', 124, 6, 21, 238154) I would also warn you against raising loans.
('62', 124, 6, 22, 238199) That will kill the movement.
('62', 124, 6, 23, 238228) We should not feel helpless for want of funds.
('62', 124, 6, 24, 238275) I would also like you not to raise further funds in regard to the budget now provided for the year.
('62', 124, 6, 25, 238375) You will please show this to Jawaharlal and Jalbhai and get their approval, if you endorse my suggestions.
('62', 124, 6, 26, 238482) On their approval being secured, the money will at once be handed over.
('62', 124, 6, 27, 238554) My personal opinion on the insurance policies is that they should be allowed to lapse.
('62', 124, 6, 28, 238641) In any case, we may not be responsible for them, unless we deliberately adopt the policy of taking out and providing for the policies of all workers.

('62', 125, 5, 10, 239255) I heard about the Vithalbhai Shraddha Committee as much as you did and from the same source.
('62', 125, 5, 11, 239348) Surely Mani is not your daughter only ?

('62', 125, 5, 17, 239589) I, therefore, follow the example of Ekalavya.

('62', 125, 5, 20, 239806) You have broken your bow and made it into a plough.
('62', 125, 5, 21, 239858) I, too, wish to plough in fields.

('62', 129, 3, 4, 245372) Vinoba has come here to serve you.
('62', 129, 3, 5, 245407) The Ashram programme is followed here regularly.
('62', 129, 3, 6, 245456) I hope you will take full advantage of it.
('62', 129, 3, 7, 245499) Shethji reminded me just now that no one was prepared to remove the carcass of a bullock, and so the Ashram inmates carried it and buried it.
('62', 129, 3, 8, 245641) The Harijan friends were displeased by this, for they think that others should not do the work allotted to the lowest even among the untouchables.
('62', 129, 3, 9, 245788) Vinoba has made a thorough study of the scriptures.
('62', 129, 3, 10, 245840) He says that nowhere has God enjoined that some are high and others low, some touchable and some untouchable.
('62', 129, 3, 11, 245950) He has been working among Harijans to wipe out these distinctions.
('62', 129, 3, 12, 246017) Dr. Ambedkar is pained and enraged by the oppression of Harijans by caste Hindus.
('62', 129, 3, 13, 246099) Why should he not feel angry at the oppression which caste Hindus have perpetrated on Harijans?
('62', 129, 3, 14, 246195) Why, then, do you make such distinctions of high and low among you?
('62', 129, 3, 15, 246263) If the position that only the Bhangis may remove night soil and dead animals is accepted, the work being done among Harijans will stop Brahmana,Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra were the four varnas and some others were regarded as belonging to the fifth varna, or as falling outside the varna system.
('62', 129, 3, 16, 246561) These varnas have not retained their original character.
('62', 129, 3, 17, 246618) What survives is the distinction of high and low.
('62', 129, 3, 18, 246668) God has not made anybody high or low.
('62', 129, 3, 19, 246706) If, living here, we serve you as your Bhangis, you should not be angry.
('62', 129, 3, 20, 246778) How can we serve Harijans ?
('62', 129, 3, 21, 246806) Should we serve the Mahars but not the Bhangis ?
('62', 129, 3, 22, 246855) Shoud we make distinctions among Harijans?
('62', 129, 3, 23, 246898) Hinduism will perish unless these distinctions are wiped out.
('62', 129, 3, 24, 246960) The majority of the population in India consists of Hindus.
('62', 129, 3, 25, 247020) If they perish, what would India be left with ?
('62', 129, 3, 26, 247068) It would of course be a different matter if all Hindus became Muslims or Christians.
('62', 129, 3, 27, 247153) If, however, we feel that Hinduism is good, we must save it from destruc tion.
('62', 129, 3, 28, 247232) It has produced innumerable saints and sages.
('62', 129, 3, 29, 247278) The Gita is one of the greatest scriptures, if not the greatest of all.

('62', 130, 1, 4, 247792) We must rid it of any imperfections or evil that may have crept into it.
('62', 130, 1, 5, 247865) The evil of untouchability that has entered it should be wiped out.
('62', 130, 1, 6, 247933) Mahar, Mang, Bhangi and similar names came into use to indicate different occupations.
('62', 130, 1, 7, 248020) But because of that it cannot be said that the Mahars are higher than the Mangs and the Mangs are higher than the Bhangis.
('62', 130, 1, 8, 248143) Mang, Bhangi, Mahar and other Harijans, all serve society.
('62', 130, 1, 9, 248202) If they did not do so, society could not survive.
('62', 130, 1, 10, 248252) The workers who have come here have done so only to serve you, and not for money.

('62', 130, 5, 16, 248535) [Before November 7, 1933] From experience I have come to the conclusion that while praying we should not worry about unwanted thoughts and should not feel unhappy if they come.
('62', 130, 5, 17, 248712) If we try to keep them out, they invade us with greater force.
('62', 130, 5, 18, 248775) Fear haunts the frightened.
('62', 130, 5, 19, 248803) The same is true about unwanted thoughts.
('62', 130, 5, 20, 248845) To keep worrying why we get such thoughts, is like devoting oneself to them through enmity.
('62', 130, 5, 21, 248937) If we get unwanted thoughts, we should know that enemies have arrived, but we should not invite them.
('62', 130, 5, 22, 249039) Just as an uninvited guest offended and leaves if he is not welcomed, so also unwanted thoughts will go away if we do not bother about them.
('62', 130, 5, 23, 249180) But at the same time, as we do not neglect the invited guest just becaue some uninvited guest has intruded, so also we should not, just because of the invasion of unwanted thoughts, feel disheartened by them and stop the practice of prayer which we want to keep up.
('62', 130, 5, 24, 249446) The more these thoughts are ignored, the weaker will they grow and the prayer will engage attention more and more.
('62', 130, 5, 25, 249561) The argument that we should stop praying because of unwanted thoughts would be correct if we ourselves invited these thoughts.
('62', 130, 5, 26, 249688) It would be sheer pretence to sit down to pray and invite thoughts at the same time.
('62', 130, 5, 27, 249773) Our mind should non co operate with bad thoughts.

('62', 132, 8, 13, 252108) Whether it is got through or not, my faith tells me that an undertaking which begins under such good auspices must result in good.
('62', 132, 8, 14, 252239) The idol in the temple is not God.
('62', 132, 8, 15, 252274) But since God resides in every atom, He resides in an idol.
('62', 132, 8, 16, 252334) When rites of consecration are per formed, special sanctitiy is attributed to the idol, and those who believe in temples perform worship by visiting them.
('62', 132, 8, 17, 252489) I hold it a blasphemy to say that the Creator resides in a temple from which a particular class of His devotees sharing the faith in it are excluded.
('62', 132, 8, 18, 252639) Ramdeoji has, therefore, well said that this will be a true temple only from today, when it is declared open to Harijans.

('62', 133, 1, 3, 253215) I should consider the sacri fice of my life as none too great for the sacred cause of the removal of this curse of untouchability.
('62', 133, 1, 4, 253346) I have not a shadow of a doubt that, if untouchability is not removed root and branch, Hinduism is bound to perish, for no religion can nurture itself on the degradation of its votaries.

('62', 133, 4, 7, 253591) November 7, 1933 It is good fortune for me that my tour begins at Wardha, which is the geographical centre of India.
('62', 133, 4, 8, 253708) I want it also to be the centre of this movement.
('62', 133, 4, 9, 253758) And I hope that the spirit with which Jamnalalji has opened his temple to Harijans and with which Vinoba and his companions have cast in their lot with Harijans will prove infectious and spread through the whole of the country.

('62', 133, 7, 12, 254046) November 8, 1933 What Mrs. Abhyankar said on behalf of hundreds of women like her touched me deeply.
('62', 133, 7, 13, 254147) 1 While she was speaking I looked at Sjt.
('62', 133, 7, 14, 254189) Abhyankar, and I saw that is eyes had become wet.
('62', 133, 7, 15, 254239) I have steeled my heart, and I do not shed tears easily; but these words could not but move me.
('62', 133, 7, 16, 254335) I admit I have been instrumental in making paupers of doctors, lawyers and merchants.
('62', 133, 7, 17, 254421) I do not repent.
('62', 133, 7, 18, 254438) On the contrary, I rejoice that many have embraced poverty voluntarily.
('62', 133, 7, 19, 254510) Why should Mrs. Abhyankar, who is trying to identify herself, alongwith her husband, with the sweepers, put on golden bangles at all ?
('62', 133, 7, 20, 254645) In a poor country like India, where people walk for miles to get a dole of one pice per day, as they are doing in Orissa today, it does not behove anybody who cares for the poor to wear costly ornaments.
('62', 133, 7, 21, 254849) In no other way can we identify ourselves with the Harijans.
('62', 133, 7, 22, 254910) Those who have nothing else have God and are men of GodHarijans.
('62', 133, 7, 23, 254975) Those who have wealth are men of wealth.
('62', 133, 8, 24, 255016) 1 Offering her two golden bangles Mrs. Abhyankar had said, Nowadays husbands leave little for their wives.
('62', 133, 8, 25, 255123) I can, therefore, only make this humble offering for the service of Harijans.
('62', 134, 0, 1, 255201) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 135
('62', 134, 1, 2, 255248) All credit, therefore, to Motilalji, Das, Vithalbhai and many others whom I can mention and who parted with their possessions for the sake of the poor.

('62', 134, 3, 4, 255420) 156. ADVICE TO HARIJANS
('62', 134, 4, 5, 255444) NAGPUR, November 8, 1933 Of course, I have told caste Hindus that they are responsible for whatever evil habits are to be noticed among the Harijans.
('62', 134, 4, 6, 255594) But this does not mean that you should hug your evil habits.
('62', 134, 4, 7, 255655) Harijans should contribute to this movement by cultivating cleanliness, both of mind and body, giving up carrion eating which is looked upon with abhor rence by the whole of humanity, giving up drink, as also the differ ences of high and low that they are observing among themselves.
('62', 134, 4, 8, 255939) When they go to temples, they should observe the rules applicable to all temple goers.
('62', 134, 5, 9, 256026) Harijan, 17 11 1933
('62', 134, 6, 10, 256046) 157. SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, NAGPUR 1
('62', 134, 7, 11, 256086) November 8, 1933 I am deeply grateful to you for the manifestation of this great affection.
('62', 134, 7, 12, 256178) Thanks be to God that you have assembled in such numbers to listen to my message.
('62', 134, 7, 13, 256260) The Chairman 2 is right when he says that this Harijan work is essentially religious from my standpoint.
('62', 134, 7, 14, 256365) That it has many other results is equally true.
('62', 134, 7, 15, 256413) There never has been a single truly religious activity but has had its influence on many departments of life.
('62', 134, 7, 16, 256523) That perhaps is one of the tests by which we recognize a great religious movement.
('62', 134, 7, 17, 256606) I would like to say in all humility, but with perfect confidence, that I have taken up this movement in no spirit of antagonism to any other religion or community.
('62', 134, 7, 18, 256770) It would be im possible for any person to point to a single act of mine during the past 50 years which could be proved to have been antagonistic to any person or community.
('62', 134, 7, 19, 256943) I have never believed anyone to be my enemy.
('62', 134, 8, 20, 256988) 1 Gandhiji spoke in Hindi.
('62', 134, 8, 21, 257015) 2 Dr. N. B. Khare.
('62', 135, 0, 1, 257034) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 136
('62', 135, 1, 2, 257076) My faith demands that I should consider no one as such.
('62', 135, 1, 3, 257132) I may not wish all to anything that lives.
('62', 135, 1, 4, 257175) It is my certain conviction that, if the Hindu heart is completely purged of the taint of untouchability, the event will have its inevitable influence not only upon all the communities in India but on the whole world.
('62', 135, 1, 5, 257393) This belief is daily becoming stronger.
('62', 135, 1, 6, 257433) I cannot remove from any heart untouchability regarding several millions of human beings and harbour it towards some other millions.
('62', 135, 1, 7, 257566) The very act of the Hindu heart getting rid of distinctions of high and low must cure us of mutual jealousies and distrust of and among other communities.
('62', 135, 1, 8, 257721) It is for that reason that I have staked my life on this issue.
('62', 135, 1, 9, 257785) In fighting this battle against untou chability.
('62', 135, 1, 10, 257834) I am fighting for unity not only between Hindu touchables and Hindu untouchables but among Hindus, Muslims, Christians and all other different religious communities.
('62', 135, 1, 11, 258000) Do not for one moment believe that I am interested in the numerical strength of Hindus.
('62', 135, 1, 12, 258088) I have never throughout my life laid stress upon quantity.
('62', 135, 1, 13, 258147) I have ever insisted upon quality at the sacrifice of quantity.
('62', 135, 1, 14, 258211) If I collected a million false coins they would be a worthless burden to me.
('62', 135, 1, 15, 258288) One true coin would be its value.
('62', 135, 1, 16, 258322) A religion cannot be sustained by the number of its lipfollowers denying in their lives its tenets.
('62', 135, 1, 17, 258422) This great Hindu religion itself will perish, in spite of its so called millions of followers, if its votaries persist in harbouring the evil of untouchability.
('62', 135, 1, 18, 258583) Not because untouchables can be counted by the millions.
('62', 135, 1, 19, 258640) If would perish even if they were a handful.
('62', 135, 1, 20, 258685) Milk is poisoned and has to thrown away whether you put a little or much arsenic in it.
('62', 135, 1, 21, 258773) If we believe that we are all children of one and the same God and that God is Truth and Justice, how can there be untouchability amongst us, His children ?
('62', 135, 1, 22, 258930) God of Truth and Justice can never create distinctions of high and low among His own children.
('62', 135, 1, 23, 259025) I, therefore, invite all without distinction of race and religion to assist this movement by praying for its complete success, so that we may all live in peace and friendship.
('62', 135, 1, 24, 259201) And if I want concord amongst all the communities professing different faiths, I cannot desire discord between the so called sana tanists and reformers.
('62', 135, 1, 25, 259354) I can harbour no ill will against sanatanists.
('62', 135, 1, 26, 259401) I ask them to extend the same toleration to reformers that they would have the latter extend towards themselves.
('62', 135, 1, 27, 259514) If they tolerate the faith and practice of others, why will they not tolerate the faith and practice of the reformers ?
('62', 135, 1, 28, 259634) They may not help so long as they regard untouch ability as an integral part of Hinduism.
('62', 135, 1, 29, 259724) I and fellow reformers firmly
('62', 136, 0, 1, 259754) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 137
('62', 136, 1, 2, 259801) believe that untouchability is an evil; and if it is so and If the reformers will continue to exercise patience and gentleness, the heart of the sanatanists must melt.
('62', 136, 1, 3, 259969) There can be no room for compulsion or violence in this great movement.
('62', 136, 1, 4, 260041) I endeavour to place before the vast mass of Hindus the results of a belief derived from such prayerful study of the Hindu scriptures as has been possible for me, and from association with those who are learned in them and, what is more, from my practice based upon that belief.
('62', 136, 1, 5, 260320) Surely, that cannot promote internal dissensions.
('62', 136, 1, 6, 260370) I observe that many who oppose this movement have not taken the trouble to understand its implications.
('62', 136, 1, 7, 260474) The object of this tour is to place the position of the reformers clearly before the public.
('62', 136, 1, 8, 260567) And I am hoping that, as the scope of the activities of the Servants of Untouchables Society becomes known, the opposition to it will melt away.
('62', 136, 1, 9, 260712) We want to change the hearts of those who today oppose the movement.
('62', 136, 1, 10, 260781) We want to remove their distrust.
('62', 136, 1, 11, 260815) We do not desire to compel them to act against their belief.
('62', 136, 1, 12, 260876) We want to win them over to the reform by gentlest persuasion, by appealing to their reason and to their hearts.
('62', 136, 1, 13, 260989) Love can never express itself by imposing sufferings on others.
('62', 136, 1, 14, 261053) It can only express itself by self suffering, by self purfication.
('62', 136, 1, 15, 261120) I am convinced that, if the reformers will show in their own lives an increasing purity, self denial, and capacity for suffering, they will be sure to melt the hearts of those who are today saturated with untouchability, believing it to be a desirable part of Hinduism.
('62', 136, 2, 16, 261390) Is is said that untouchables are so because of the evil in them.
('62', 136, 2, 17, 261455) But are the touchables better ?
('62', 136, 2, 18, 261487) Are they sinless ?
('62', 136, 2, 19, 261506) Indeed, defenders of untouchability claim that some people are always untouchables and that no amount of pure conduct can pure them of the taint with which they are born.
('62', 136, 2, 20, 261677) They must remain social lepers for ever.
('62', 136, 2, 21, 261718) The fact is that whatever weakness we may notice about untouchables are a reflection of our own weaknesses and sins.
('62', 136, 2, 22, 261835) They are a direct result of the ill treatment that we have heaped upon their devoted heads.
('62', 136, 2, 23, 261927) Their real rise, therefore, depends upon te removing of untouchability root and branch and upon showing a growing purity in our own lives.
('62', 136, 2, 24, 262066) Thus the movement is dependent, not so much upon pecuniary help, as upon correct conduct.
('62', 136, 2, 25, 262156) Pecuniary help is to be an earnest of our deter mination to rid ourselves of the evil and to achieve self purification.
('62', 136, 2, 26, 262276) The question is repeatedly asked whether the reform includes
('62', 137, 0, 1, 262337) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 138
('62', 137, 1, 2, 262379) inter dining.
('62', 137, 1, 3, 262393) Though I have answered this question repeatedly, I must continue to repeat the answer as long as the question continues to be asked.
('62', 137, 1, 4, 262526) Everybody knows what my personal views are.
('62', 137, 1, 5, 262570) Since my youth upward I have consistently dined with all so long as the rules of cleanliness have been observed.
('62', 137, 1, 6, 262683) But that has nothing to do with the present movement.
('62', 137, 1, 7, 262737) Interdining and the rest is a question for each individual to determine for himself.
('62', 137, 1, 8, 262822) The movement organized by the Servants of Untouchables Society stands for simple removal of untouchability in every shape and form, in so far as it is special to the so called untouchables.
('62', 137, 1, 9, 263012) They would have the same public rights and facilities as are enjoyed by every other Hindu, that is to say, they should have access to all public institutions, such as wells, schools, roads, temples, etc.
('62', 137, 1, 10, 263216) One word as to the objections raised against Anti untouchability Bill.
('62', 137, 1, 11, 263287) Sanatanists have contended that they constitute State Interference in matters of religion.
('62', 137, 1, 12, 263378) I suppose by interference is meant that which is undue.
('62', 137, 1, 13, 263434) For it is possible to quote instances where State interference has been sought and has been inevitable in matters of religion.
('62', 137, 1, 14, 263561) What is sought is freedom from external compulsion.
('62', 137, 1, 15, 263613) I am no more in favour of such compulsion in matters affecting religion, than sanatanists.
('62', 137, 1, 16, 263704) These Bills involve no such compulsion, no undue interference.
('62', 137, 1, 17, 263767) The interference sought is beneficial and unavoidable.
('62', 137, 1, 18, 263822) If the State compelled the opening of temples To Harijans, it would without doubt be undue interference, but it cannot be undue when the State is called upon to legalize the voluntary opening by a stated majority of templegoers or the trustees.
('62', 137, 1, 19, 264067) Not to do so would be compulsion.
('62', 137, 1, 20, 264101) The Temple entry Bill merely seeks to legalize the action of a majority.
('62', 137, 1, 21, 264174) The other Bill has been long overdue.
('62', 137, 1, 22, 264212) It does not abolish untouch ability altogether.
('62', 137, 1, 23, 264260) It seeks to rob it of secular consequences.
('62', 137, 1, 24, 264304) To clothe it with such consequences is to constitute an intolerable interference with the free exercise of religion.
('62', 137, 1, 25, 264421) Nobody will deny that to make a religious obligation an obligation in law would be a gross and undue interference by the State.
('62', 137, 1, 26, 264549) The observance of untouc hability requires the voluntary recognition of it by both touchables and untouchables.
('62', 137, 1, 27, 264661) For the State to compel observance by untou chables would be a gross interference in matters of religion.
('62', 137, 1, 28, 264767) The Bill, therefore, seeks to remove the secular recognition of untouchability, without in any way inter 
('62', 138, 0, 1, 264873) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 139
('62', 138, 1, 2, 264920) fering with the religious observance of it or the religious conse quences of the breach of it.
('62', 138, 1, 3, 265015) If the objectors mean, therefore, what they say and on a careful study should find that the Bills involve no compulsion, they should waive their objection.
('62', 138, 2, 4, 265171) The poor man perhaps had nothing else to pay and he seems to have paid his all.
('62', 138, 2, 5, 265251) It is an unsoiled cowrie, as Malaviyaji would call it.
('62', 138, 2, 6, 265306) We attribute our earnings to fate, but what we give in the name of God, and for the service of His creatures bring us merit.
('62', 138, 2, 7, 265431) Looking at it as a symbol of sacrifce, it is more precious than gold.

('62', 138, 5, 10, 265554) NAGPUR,
('62', 138, 6, 11, 265562) Before the morning prayer, November 9, 1933
('62', 138, 7, 12, 265606) BHAI VALLABHBHAI,
('62', 138, 8, 13, 265624) I got your letter.
('62', 138, 8, 14, 265643) You must not stop writing to me while I am touring.
('62', 138, 8, 15, 265695) I will also write to you.
('62', 138, 8, 16, 265721) What happened regarding Vithalbhai has not passed unnoticed by me.
('62', 138, 8, 17, 265788) I also have been attacked strongly.
('62', 138, 8, 18, 265824) I have paid no attention at all to these attacks.
('62', 138, 8, 19, 265874) Even if I did, what could I do!
('62', 138, 8, 20, 265906) If you stir dirty water, more dirt will come to the surface.
('62', 138, 8, 21, 265967) I paid attention only to Subhass services.
('62', 138, 8, 22, 266010) As for the stories we hear regar ding Vithalbhais last wishes 2 , we can say nothing.
('62', 138, 8, 23, 266096) I, too, have my doubts as you have.
('62', 138, 9, 24, 266132) My work commenced from Tuesday.
('62', 138, 9, 25, 266164) Wherever I go, large crowds assemble.
('62', 138, 9, 26, 266202) They dont seem to resent my talking about untou chability.
('62', 138, 9, 27, 266261) A fine temple near Wardha was thrown open to Harijans.
('62', 138, 10, 28, 266316) 1 Gandhiji then auctioned the gifts which included the cowrie given to him at Katol.
('62', 138, 10, 29, 266401) The remarks that follow are taken from Chandrashankar Shuklas weekly letter entitled The First Weeks Tour.
('62', 138, 10, 30, 266508) 2 It was reported that Vithalbhai Patel had bequeathed a large sum to Subhas Chandra Bose to be used at his discretion for propaganda abroad.
('62', 138, 10, 31, 266650) Later, the Bombay High Court decided that the amount should go to Vithalbhais legatees.
('62', 138, 10, 32, 266738) Gandhiji persuaded the family to give it to the Congress for national service.

('62', 139, 0, 1, 266850) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 140
('62', 139, 1, 2, 266892) There was a large crowd such as had never had never been seen before in this city.
('62', 139, 1, 3, 266975) My voice met the demand on it fairly well.
('62', 139, 1, 4, 267018) Nor did I get tired.
('62', 139, 1, 5, 267039) I have started with my weight 108 or 109. The collection also, I think, was good.
('62', 139, 1, 6, 267121) After completing the C. P., I have to go to Delhi and from there straight to the South.
('62', 139, 1, 7, 267209) Raja says that it is necessary to tour the South first.
('62', 139, 1, 8, 267265) The opposition of the sanatanists comes mainly from there.
('62', 139, 1, 9, 267324) I have to return to Wardha on Saturday.
('62', 139, 1, 10, 267364) The Wardha taluka remains to be toured.
('62', 139, 1, 11, 267404) Meanwhile Jawaharlal and others will come to see me.
('62', 139, 1, 12, 267457) Ansari 1has already arrived.
('62', 139, 1, 13, 267486) Hence he also may join me.
('62', 139, 1, 14, 267513) With me are Mira, Chandrashankar, Nayar Ramnath (of the Sasta Sahitya of Delhi), Om and the wife of Rameshwar Birlas 2son.
('62', 139, 1, 15, 267636) The last will be with me for a few days only.
('62', 139, 1, 16, 267682) Om has become a strong willed girl.
('62', 139, 1, 17, 267718) Thakkar Bapa also is in the party.
('62', 139, 1, 18, 267753) Ba will leave Wardha on the 13th.
('62', 139, 1, 19, 267787) She will reach Ahmedabad about the 15th or the 16th.
('62', 139, 1, 20, 267840) This time she is very much agitated.
('62', 139, 1, 21, 267877) She is restless no doubt.
('62', 139, 1, 22, 267903) But she will go [to jail].
('62', 139, 1, 23, 267930) She is convinced that that is the only right course.

('62', 140, 2, 3, 268247) November 9, 1933
('62', 140, 3, 4, 268264) MANI, I have your letter.
('62', 140, 3, 5, 268290) You have acted wisely in writing to me frankly.
('62', 140, 3, 6, 268338) In future also do the same.
('62', 140, 3, 7, 268366) If not you who else will write ?
('62', 140, 3, 8, 268399) I was surprised to learn that Dahyabhai misunderstood my action and got angry.
('62', 140, 3, 9, 268478) But we need not pay attention to that.
('62', 140, 3, 10, 268517) Perhaps he is not even acquainted with all the facts.
('62', 140, 3, 11, 268571) I can even understand his being pained.
('62', 140, 3, 12, 268611) You yourself should try to calm him as much as you an.
('62', 140, 3, 13, 268666) If you wish, I will write to him and try to soothe him.
('62', 140, 3, 14, 268722) I will like it better.
('62', 140, 3, 15, 268745) You may show him this letter if you like.
('62', 140, 3, 16, 268787) Ba will leave Wardha on Tuesday.
('62', 140, 3, 17, 268820) She will halt at Akola for a short while, i..e., for a few hours and then go there.
('62', 140, 3, 18, 268904) At present she is in a rather confused state of mind.
('62', 140, 3, 19, 268958) She is worried also.
('62', 140, 3, 20, 268979) All the same, she herself announced her resolution of going [to jail].
('62', 140, 3, 21, 269050) You should try and strengthen it.
('62', 140, 3, 22, 269084) Eat well and improve your health as much as you can.
('62', 140, 3, 23, 269137) Write to me regularly.
('62', 140, 3, 24, 269160) Do take the rays as long as you can.
('62', 140, 3, 25, 269197) You can receive the treatment even in Ahmedabad.
('62', 140, 3, 26, 269246) What did you do regarding your teeth ?
('62', 140, 3, 27, 269285) Jawaharlal and others are coming to Wardha on Saturday.
('62', 140, 3, 28, 269341) What did Mridu 1 do in Allahabad ?
('62', 140, 3, 29, 269376) Did she return satisfied ?
('62', 140, 3, 30, 269403) Ask her to write to me.
('62', 140, 3, 31, 269427) What did she do about her teeth ?
('62', 140, 3, 32, 269461) If she has heard more about Saraladevi 2, she should let me have the news.
('62', 140, 3, 33, 269536) We had a very good meeting in Nagpur.
('62', 140, 3, 34, 269574) The tour has started well.

('62', 141, 3, 4, 269855) GANGABEHN, I got your letter.
('62', 141, 3, 5, 269885) Serve people as well as you can and be con tented.
('62', 141, 3, 6, 269936) Seeing other mens mansions, we dont demolish our own hut.
('62', 141, 3, 7, 269994) The happiness which people may enjoy in mansions is possible in huts, too.
('62', 141, 3, 8, 270069) You are doing good work in running a school for Harijan pupils.
('62', 141, 3, 9, 270133) If you live exclusively on milk and fruit, that is bound to do you good.
('62', 141, 3, 10, 270206) You need not, then, eat anything else.
('62', 141, 3, 11, 270245) Nanibehn should write to me.
('62', 141, 3, 12, 270274) Write always at Wardha.

('62', 141, 9, 18, 270431) Questioned whether he would issue a statement to the Press in connection with the all India anti untouchability tour, the Mahatma said that there was nothing to warrant a statement from him.
('62', 141, 9, 19, 270622) All that he wanted to say in that connection had been said by him in his address at the Nagpur public meeting the previous night.
('62', 141, 9, 20, 270752) He said he would be prepared to answer questions but warned them not to improvise questions.
('62', 141, 10, 21, 270845) Q. How many years do you think it will take for complete removal of untouchability at the present rate of progress ?
('62', 141, 10, 22, 270962) A. It is more than I can answer.
('62', 141, 10, 23, 270995) It is a question of a change of the hearts of millions of human beings.
('62', 141, 11, 24, 271067) Q. Will you be prepared to receive swaraj before this curse is removed ?
('62', 141, 11, 25, 271140) A. T he question is badly put.
('62', 141, 11, 26, 271171) There is no meaning in asking whether I shall be prepared to receive swaraj if untouchability is not removed by then.
('62', 141, 11, 27, 271289) Swaraj in not a matter of receiving or taking.
('62', 141, 11, 28, 271336) It is one of evolution .
('62', 141, 11, 29, 271361) We either grow to it from day to day or we go away from it.
('62', 141, 11, 30, 271421) If we, as a nation, are becoming more and more conscious of ourselves if the fundamental unity of millions, then we

('62', 142, 0, 1, 271572) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 143
('62', 142, 1, 2, 271619) are certainly progressing towards it.
('62', 142, 1, 3, 271657) Whereas, if we are dissolving, then we are receding from it.
('62', 142, 2, 4, 271718) Q. Do you not realize that the depressed classes have even now got their own
('62', 142, 3, 5, 271795) superstitions and that they very much hesitate to associate with, for instance,
('62', 142, 4, 6, 271875) Brahmins, even if the are asked to do so ?
('62', 142, 4, 7, 271918) A. No, I do not; because, if what you say is true, it means that they want to remain in their present state of degradation.
('62', 142, 4, 8, 272042) I cannot understand a social leper glorying in his leprosy.
('62', 142, 4, 9, 272102) If the so called de pressed classes are so disgusted with the so called high class Hindus that they want absolutely to cut themselves adrift from Hinduism and Hindus, then they form a separate entity, which means they establish a new religion, or they accept any of the other prevailing religions of India.
('62', 142, 4, 10, 272409) That is a thing which can happen, if the so called higher classes continue to wallow in their imaginary superiority and do not perform the elementary duty of regarding the Harijans as their kith and kin.
('62', 142, 4, 11, 272613) This anti untouchability movement is an attempt to do this elementary duty by the Harijans.
('62', 142, 5, 12, 272705) Q. Harijans seem to be unwilling to mix with caste Hindus.
('62', 142, 5, 13, 272764) Is it not a fact ?
('62', 142, 5, 14, 272783) A. My experience is wholly different.
('62', 142, 5, 15, 272821) I have talked with thou sands of Harijans.
('62', 142, 5, 16, 272864) They are eager to associate with the higher classes, if the latter behave themselves.
('62', 142, 5, 17, 272950) What is true is that they distrust the higher classes, and where they do not distrust them, they are afraid of them.
('62', 142, 5, 18, 273067) And there is this unfortunate additonal fact the the notion of inferiority from birth has been so much injected into them that they consider themselves doomed by God to eternal inferiority.
('62', 142, 5, 19, 273257) This must be a matter of shame and humiliation for every thinking savarna Hindu.
('62', 142, 6, 20, 273338) The best way for the so called caste Hindus was to forget that they were higher
('62', 142, 7, 21, 273418) than anybody else.
('62', 142, 7, 22, 273437) It was all a reflection of what was today a fact among the higher
('62', 142, 8, 23, 273503) classes.
('62', 142, 8, 24, 273512) It ought to cause no surprise to higher classes when they discover that there
('62', 142, 9, 25, 273590) are differences in untouchability and therefore among untouchables.

('62', 143, 2, 3, 273823) November 9, 1933 I know this tussle between English and Hindi is almost an eternal tussle.
('62', 143, 2, 4, 273914) 1 Whenever I have addressed student audiences, I have been sur prised by the demand for English.
('62', 143, 2, 5, 274011) You know, or ought to know, that I am a lover of the English language.
('62', 143, 2, 6, 274082) But I do believe that the students of India, who are expected to throw in their lot with the teeming millions and to serve them, will be better qualified if they pay more attention to Hindi than to English.
('62', 143, 2, 7, 274289) I do not say that you should not learn English; learn it by all means.
('62', 143, 2, 8, 274360) But, so far as I can see, it cannot be the language of the millions of Indian homes.
('62', 143, 2, 9, 274445) It will be confined to thousands or tens of thousands, but it will not reach the millions.
('62', 143, 2, 10, 274536) Therefore, I am delighted when the students ask me to speak in Hindi.
('62', 143, 2, 11, 274606) You, both the speakers, have spoken of me in terms, which if I believed to be true of myself, I do not know where I would be.
('62', 143, 2, 12, 274732) But I know my place.
('62', 143, 2, 13, 274753) I am a humble servant of India, and in trying to serve India, I serve humanity at large.
('62', 143, 2, 14, 274842) I discovered in my early days that the service of India is not inconsistent with the service of humanity.
('62', 143, 2, 15, 274948) As I grew older in years, and I hope also in wisdom, I saw that the discovery was well made, and after nearly 50 years of public life, I am able to say today that my faith in the doctrine, that the service of ones nation is not inconsistent with the service of the world, has grown.
('62', 143, 2, 16, 275231) It is a good doctrine.
('62', 143, 2, 17, 275254) Its acceptance alone will ease the situation in the world and stop the mutual jealousies between nations inhabiting this globe of ours.
('62', 143, 2, 18, 275390) You have said truly that in taking up this war against untouchability, I have not confined myself to Hinduism.
('62', 143, 2, 19, 275501) I have said more than once that, if untouchability is removed in its fulness from the Hindu heart, it will have farreaching consequences, in as much as it touches millions of human beings.
('62', 143, 2, 20, 275690) As I said last night to the great meeting in Nagpur, if untouchability is really removed from the Hindu heart, that is, if the high caste Hindus purge themselves of this terrible taint, we shall soon discover that we are all one and not different peoples, Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Parsis, whatever we may call our selves.
('62', 143, 2, 21, 276016) We shall
('62', 143, 3, 22, 276025) 1 Gandhiji had begun his speech in Hindi.
('62', 143, 3, 23, 276067) But as there was a cry for English, he spoke in English.

('62', 144, 1, 2, 276171) feel the unity, once the barrier of untouchability is removed.
('62', 144, 1, 3, 276234) As I have often said, untouchability is a hydraheaded monster, appearing in many shapes.
('62', 144, 1, 4, 276323) Some of them are very subtle.
('62', 144, 1, 5, 276353) If I have jealousy for any human being that also is a species of untouchability.
('62', 144, 1, 6, 276434) I do not know if my dream about the removal of untouchability.
('62', 144, 1, 7, 276497) I do not know if my dream about the removal of untouchability will be fully realized while I am living.
('62', 144, 1, 8, 276601) All those who are religiously inclined, those who believe not in formal religion but in the essence of religion, cannot but believe in the removal of a subtle type of untouchability that affects the lives of a vast mass of humanity.
('62', 144, 1, 9, 276834) If Hindu hearts can be purged of this evil, our eyes of understanding will be more and more opened.
('62', 144, 1, 10, 276934) It is not possible to estimate the gain to humanity when untouchability is really removed.
('62', 144, 1, 11, 277025) You can now have no difficulty in understanding why I have staked my life for this one thing.
('62', 144, 1, 12, 277119) If you, the students who have assembled here, have followed me so far and understood the implications of this mission of mine, you will soon extend the help I want from you.
('62', 144, 1, 13, 277293) Many students have written to me asking what part they can take in helping this movement.
('62', 144, 1, 14, 277383) It is a surprise to me that students are obliged to ask this question.
('62', 144, 1, 15, 277454) The field is so vast and near you that you need not ask the question as to what you may do and what you may not.
('62', 144, 1, 16, 277567) It is not political question.
('62', 144, 1, 17, 277597) It may become one, but for you and me, for the time being, it is not connected with politics.
('62', 144, 1, 18, 277691) My life is governed by religion.
('62', 144, 1, 19, 277724) I have said that even my politics are derived from my religion.
('62', 144, 1, 20, 277788) I never lost sight of the principle that governs my life when I began dabbling in politics.
('62', 144, 1, 21, 277880) As this is a humanitarian campaign, students must devote a part of their spare time, if not the whole, to the service of thousands of Harijans.
('62', 144, 1, 22, 278024) By giving me this magnificent purse you have certainly equalled the brightest records of students meetings which I have addressed in my many peregrinations throughout the length and breadth of India.
('62', 144, 1, 23, 278224) But I want much more from you.
('62', 144, 1, 24, 278255) I have found that, if I get many helpers who can give their spare time, much work can be done.
('62', 144, 1, 25, 278350) This work cannot be done by hired labour.
('62', 144, 1, 26, 278392) With hired labour we cannot go to Harijan quarters and sweep their roads, enter their houses and wash their children.
('62', 144, 1, 27, 278510) I have described in the columns of the Harijan What students can do.
('62', 144, 1, 28, 278579) 1 A Harijan teacher has shown what a Herculean task it is for him to tackle.
('62', 144, 1, 29, 278656) Even wild children are better than Harijan children.
('62', 144, 1, 30, 278709) Wild children are not sunk in utter degradation,

('62', 145, 1, 2, 278829) as the Harjian children are, nor do they live in such filthy surroun dings.
('62', 145, 1, 3, 278905) This problem cannot be tackled by hired labour.
('62', 145, 1, 4, 278953) No amount of money can enable me to do hired labour.
('62', 145, 1, 5, 279006) No amount of money can enabel me to do this.
('62', 145, 1, 6, 279051) It must be your prerogative.
('62', 145, 1, 7, 279080) It is an acid test of the education received by you in schools and colleges.
('62', 145, 1, 8, 279157) Your worth will not be measured by your ability to make faultless English speeches.
('62', 145, 1, 9, 279241) Your worth will be measured by the service you render to the poor and not by Government posts worth Rs. 60 or Rs. 600 that you may have got.
('62', 145, 1, 10, 279382) I wish you would do this work in the spirit I suggest.
('62', 145, 1, 11, 279437) I have not met a single student who has said that he cannot spare one hour per day.
('62', 145, 1, 12, 279521) If you write your diary from day to day, you will find that you waste many a precious hour in the 365 days of the year.
('62', 145, 1, 13, 279641) If you want to turn your education to good account, you will turn your attention to this work while this hurricane campaign lasts.
('62', 145, 1, 14, 279772) Erstwhile students are serving Harijans whithin a radius of 5 miles round about Wardha.
('62', 145, 1, 15, 279860) They are doing good silent work; therefore, you do not know them.
('62', 145, 1, 16, 279926) I invite you to see their work.
('62', 145, 1, 17, 279958) It is hard but pleasurable.
('62', 145, 1, 18, 279986) It will give you joy, greater than your cricket or tennis.
('62', 145, 1, 19, 280045) I have repeatedly said that money will come if I have real, intelligent, honest workers.
('62', 145, 1, 20, 280134) As a boy of 18 I began my education in begging.
('62', 145, 1, 21, 280182) I have seen that money can be found easily if we have the right kind of workers.
('62', 145, 1, 22, 280263) Money alone will never satisfy me.
('62', 145, 1, 23, 280298) I would ask you to pledge yourselves to devote a definite number of spare hours to Harijan service.
('62', 145, 1, 24, 280398) As you, Mr. President, have said, I am a dreamer.
('62', 145, 1, 25, 280448) I am indeed a practical dreamer.
('62', 145, 1, 26, 280481) My dreams are not airy nothings.
('62', 145, 1, 27, 280514) I want to convert my dreams into realities as far as possible.
('62', 145, 1, 28, 280577) Therefore, I must hasten to auction the gifts I have received from you.

('62', 146, 3, 4, 280775) For me the money you give is a token of your identification with the cause.

('62', 146, 4, 6, 280923) You may not think that you have lost your money.
('62', 146, 4, 7, 280972) Those who have given have gained it, and those who, though able, have refrained have in reality lost it.
('62', 146, 4, 8, 281077) The money spent in gambling, drink and lust is a double loss, for you lose your money and lose also your reputation and health.
('62', 146, 4, 9, 281205) Whereas those who give even a pice for the service of humanity gain more than they give.
('62', 146, 4, 10, 281294) Untouchability is a blot on Hinduism.
('62', 146, 4, 11, 281332) It is a canker eating into its vitals.
('62', 146, 4, 12, 281371) I see with my eyes and smell with my nose that the body of Hinduism is in the process of destruction.
('62', 146, 4, 13, 281473) If you think with me, you should contribute your mite to this cause.
('62', 146, 4, 14, 281542) Once we lose the spiritual power of Hinduism I do not know where we should be.
('62', 146, 4, 15, 281621) A man without religion is like a ship without a rudder.
('62', 146, 4, 16, 281677) The money, therefore, that you give is to my mind a token of your desire to save Hinduism from spiritual destruction.

('62', 146, 7, 19, 281826) TRUE AHIMSA Jamshed Mehta, a true servant of humanity, sends me a rendering, received by him from a friend, of a discourse on ahimsa in Jnaneshwari Gita 4. Chapter XIII.
('62', 146, 7, 20, 281996) I have taken the liberty of further condensing it and putting it in a form perhaps more easily to be understood, without in any way marring the sense of the original.
('62', 146, 7, 21, 282163) Those who still harbour untouchability in their bosoms will do well to

('62', 147, 1, 2, 282598) test it on the touchstone provided by the great saint of Maharashtra.
('62', 147, 1, 3, 282668) Is untouchability compatible with his definition of ahimsa ?
('62', 147, 1, 4, 282729) Let the extract speak for itself : Before considering what is real ahimsa, it is necessary to see what it is not.
('62', 147, 1, 5, 282843) In order to secure a good rainfall, people perform what they call sacrifices in which they kill animals.
('62', 147, 1, 6, 282948) This is not ahimsa.
('62', 147, 1, 7, 282968) Is it not like cutting off ones own hands so that they may be cooked and served as food ?
('62', 147, 1, 8, 283058) Is it wise to cut off all the branches of a tree, in order to put a fence round it, with those branches?
('62', 147, 1, 9, 283163) Then, again, to save many people from diseases, people cut away whole trees, or take out all the bark, or make extracts of living animals and take out secretions from other creatures.
('62', 147, 1, 10, 283347) Is it not like pulling down a house in order to build a verandah or shed for the house, and burning your clothes in order to have a fire to warm yourself ?
('62', 147, 1, 11, 283503) Real ahimsa or love originates in ones heart and is known by ones conduct even as gold is known by its qualities.
('62', 147, 1, 12, 283617) A man who is full of love never forgets that the world is full of life like his and takes great care that he does not harm any living thing.
('62', 147, 1, 13, 283758) He sees his love reflected in the eyes of those whom he meets.
('62', 147, 1, 14, 283821) He is the friend of all.
('62', 147, 1, 15, 283846) As a cat holds her kittens between her teeth without hurting them, so does a man of love deal with all with whom he comes in contact.
('62', 147, 1, 16, 283980) He walks gently and noiselessly lest his footsteps may disturb the sleep of others.
('62', 147, 1, 17, 284064) He always makes room for those who need it.
('62', 147, 1, 18, 284108) He so regulates his voice as not to jar on others.
('62', 147, 1, 19, 284159) He is silent when he need not speak.
('62', 147, 1, 20, 284196) His speech is never intended to offend anyone.
('62', 147, 1, 21, 284243) He does not want to up set other peoples plans or to frighten them.
('62', 147, 1, 22, 284311) He never utters words which lead to discussions and disputations, or which hurt the feelings of others.
('62', 147, 1, 23, 284415) There is no deceit in his talk, nor doubt not ambiguity.
('62', 147, 1, 24, 284472) He never stares lest his stare may offend people.
('62', 147, 1, 25, 284522) He does not move his hands aimlessly as he has no desire to harm even a mosquito.
('62', 147, 1, 26, 284604) He does not carry even a stick, not to speak of other weapons.
('62', 147, 1, 27, 284667) His hands are used only for salutation or service.
('62', 147, 1, 28, 284718) These are but the outward signs of the inner abiding love as a plant is of the seed that has borne it.
('62', 147, 1, 29, 284821) His mind is the Master of all the organs.
('62', 147, 1, 30, 284863) Thus, real ahimsa is an attitude of the mind expressed through the different sense organs.
('62', 147, 1, 31, 284954) He alone who is

('62', 148, 2, 4, 285141) 165. A COMMON PLATFORM
('62', 148, 3, 5, 285164) A correspondent sends me an essay by Sir C. V. Kumaraswamy Sastriar, ex High Court Judge, Madras.
('62', 148, 3, 6, 285262) It occupies three sides of a foolscap in print.
('62', 148, 3, 7, 285310) It is written on behalf of Sanatanists.
('62', 148, 3, 8, 285350) It is an attempt to show that untouchability has existed from time immemorial and that the legislation such as is contemplated is futile.
('62', 148, 3, 9, 285488) It, however, concludes with this significant paragraph :
('62', 148, 4, 10, 285545) Several social inequalities and exclusive outlooks are being softened or removed by time and education.
('62', 148, 4, 11, 285649) The old order is changing, and with it the older conception of humanity.
('62', 148, 4, 12, 285722) Several communities once considered depressed or servile have, owing to rise in education and material well being, become possessed of rights and privileges.
('62', 148, 4, 13, 285880) No lover of India would claim that communties and castes should be in a state of antagonism, or that social injustice and inequalities should not be adjusted.
('62', 148, 4, 14, 286039) But nobody can view without pain and alarm the methods adopted and the aids sought, which will only accentuate the ill feeling between the caste Hindus and the depressed classes, without any considerable material advntage to the latter.
('62', 148, 4, 15, 286276) Their state of depression lies in other and deeper causes and its removal lies in combined effort by the caste Hindus to improve their material and educational state.
('62', 148, 4, 16, 286443) This paragraph, in my humble opinion, vitiates the prior rea soning in support of untouchability as a sacrosanct religious insti tuion, It seems to admit that it is a social evil which the learned ex Judge will gladly see uprooted.
('62', 148, 4, 17, 286675) And every reformer will agree with him when he says nobody can view without pain and alarm the methods adpoted and the aids sought, which will only accentuate the ill feeling between the caste Hindus and the depressed classes, without any considerable material advantage to the latter. Only, the reformer must add that Sir Kumaraswamys fears are imaginary.
('62', 148, 4, 18, 287032) Reformers have adopted no method and sought no aid so as to accentuate ill feeling.
('62', 148, 4, 19, 287116) Sir Kumaraswamy has not given himself time to study what the reformers are doing and how they are doing it.
('62', 148, 4, 20, 287224) Indeed, I can show him that they are even postponing the material advantage to the Harijans where ill feeling, already existing, is likely to grow into a fight with blows.
('62', 148, 4, 21, 287396) Thus, for instance, reformers have been postponing summary action even regarding the use of certain public wells to
('62', 149, 0, 1, 287512) 150 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('62', 149, 1, 2, 287554) which Harijans are beyond doubt entitled in law.
('62', 149, 1, 3, 287603) As for the aids sought, reformers will readily agree that social prejudices cannot be removed by summoning the assistance of law.
('62', 149, 1, 4, 287733) But they do invoke and insist on legal and legislative aid when the law is interpreted to uphold untouchability.
('62', 149, 1, 5, 287846) No reform in respect of an evil can succeed in the teeth of legal protection thereof.
('62', 149, 1, 6, 287932) It is hardly necessary to state the legislative obstacles can only be removed by legislative hindrance and nothing more.
('62', 149, 1, 7, 288053) What they desire is that untouchability should have no legal sanction.
('62', 149, 1, 8, 288124) They recognize that, even when that is withdrawn, as a social evil it will demand attention for a long time to come.
('62', 149, 1, 9, 288241) I welcome the last sentence of the paragraph.
('62', 149, 1, 10, 288287) When there is a combined effort by the caste Hindus to improve their (the Harijans) material and educational state,untouchability will not be long indis appearing from the land.
('62', 149, 1, 11, 288465) If the sanatanists distrust the reformers, let them work independently.
('62', 149, 1, 12, 288537) Will Sir Kumaraswamy move the sanata nists to action ?If he succeeds, there will be no ill feeling left.
('62', 149, 1, 13, 288642) Does he know that in the name of sanatana dharma its so called represen tatives have burned the crops of innocent Harijans, assaulted them and otherwise molested them when in the exercise of their just and legal rights ?

('62', 149, 3, 15, 288883) 166. FOR HARIJAN TEACHERS
('62', 149, 4, 16, 288909) One who is responsible for the management of over twenty five Harijan schools writes a long letter stating the difficulties experienced in the management of the school and asks how I would conduct them if I had the direct management thereof.
('62', 149, 4, 17, 289151) I need not recount his difficulties which he has described carefully.
('62', 149, 4, 18, 289221) What I am about to say is an attempt to answer them.
('62', 149, 4, 19, 289274) While we are bound to give scholarships and other help to those Harijan boys and girls who attend the established schools, there is no reason whatever slavishly to reproduce the mode and methods of those schools in the ones under our own management.
('62', 149, 4, 20, 289524) We have to recognize that we get Harijan children with great difficulty to attend any school at all.
('62', 149, 4, 21, 289625) We cannot expect any degree of regularity in them and, thanks to our past criminal neglect, they are so unkempt that we have, in the beginning stages, to handle them in a manner wholly different from the ordinary.
('62', 150, 0, 1, 289839) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 151
('62', 150, 1, 2, 289886) On first adimission their bodies have to be minutely examined and thoroughly cleaned.
('62', 150, 1, 3, 289972) Their clothes might have to be cleaned and patched.
('62', 150, 1, 4, 290024) The first daily lesson, therefore, will for some time consist of applied hygiene and sanitation and simple needle work.
('62', 150, 1, 5, 290144) I should use no books probably for the whole of the first year.
('62', 150, 1, 6, 290208) I should talk to them about things with which they are familiar and, doing so, correct their pronunciation and grammar and teach them new words.
('62', 150, 1, 7, 290353) I should note all the new words they may learn from day to day so as to enable me to use them frequently till they have them fixed in the their minds regularly.
('62', 150, 1, 8, 290514) The teacher will not give discourses but adopt the conver sational method.
('62', 150, 1, 9, 290589) Through conversations he will give his pupils pro gressive instruction in history, geography and arithmetic.
('62', 150, 1, 10, 290698) History will begin with that of our own times, and then, too, of events and of persons nearest us, and geography will begin with that of the neigh bourhood of the school.
('62', 150, 1, 11, 290869) Arithmetic will begin with the sums appli cable of the pupils homes.
('62', 150, 1, 12, 290938) Having tried the method myself, I know that infinitely more knowledge can be given to the pupils through it, and without strain on them, than can be given through the orthodox method, within a given time.
('62', 150, 1, 13, 291143) Knowledge of the alphabet should be treated as a separate subject altogether.
('62', 150, 1, 14, 291221) The letters should be treated as pictures which the children will first be taught to recognize and name.
('62', 150, 1, 15, 291326) Writing will follow as part of the drawing lesson.
('62', 150, 1, 16, 291377) Instead of making daubs of their letters, pupils should be able to make perfect copies of the models placed before them.
('62', 150, 1, 17, 291498) They would not, therefore, be called upon to draw the letters till they had acquired control over their fingers and the pen.
('62', 150, 1, 18, 291623) It is criminal to stunt the mental growth of a child by letting him know as much only as he can get through a book he can incoherently read in a year.
('62', 150, 1, 19, 291774) We do not realize that, if a child was cut of from the home life and was merely doomed to the school, he would be a perfect dunce for several years.
('62', 150, 1, 20, 291923) He picks up information and language unconsciously through his home, not in the schoolroom.
('62', 150, 1, 21, 292015) Hence do we experience the immense difference between pupils belonging to cultured homes and those belonging to uncouth homes, which are no homes in reality.
('62', 150, 1, 22, 292173) In the scheme I have adumbrated, the schoolmaster is expected to treat his occupation seriously and feel one with his pupils.
('62', 150, 1, 23, 292299) I know that, in putting the scheme into operation, the want of schoolmasters of the right type is the greatest difficulty.
('62', 150, 1, 24, 292422) But we shall not get the right type till we have made the right beginning.

('62', 152, 7, 9, 293680) Gandhiji deprecated the attitude of the higher castes if the allegations 2 made
('62', 152, 8, 10, 293760) by the Harijans were true.
('62', 152, 8, 11, 293787) He wanted a cleansing of the hearts and not a mere show.
('62', 152, 9, 12, 293844) however, they wanted to keep them separate still, they must declare so openly and be
('62', 152, 10, 13, 293929) prepared to meet the consequences.
('62', 152, 10, 14, 293964) He could not reply to the other charge against the bidi merchants, as he had no knowledge of the same.
('62', 152, 10, 15, 294067) He pointed out how both
('62', 152, 11, 16, 294091) depended on the co operation of each other and asked them to give up aloofness.

('62', 152, 13, 18, 294245) Mahatmaji said, had been chosen by a Harijan and not invented by him.
('62', 152, 13, 19, 294315) He said he preferred to call himself a Haijan.
('62', 152, 13, 20, 294362) He asked the bidi merchants to give fair treatment
('62', 152, 14, 21, 294413) to their labourers, and thanked them for the donations they freely gave to the cause
('62', 152, 15, 22, 294498) taken up by him.
('62', 152, 15, 23, 294515) Mahatmaji then referred to the sales of khadi in the local Bhandar
('62', 152, 16, 24, 294582) which he said were very poor.
('62', 152, 16, 25, 294612) For a town like Gondia, only Rs. 1,000 worth of khadi
('62', 152, 17, 26, 294666) was sold per month.
('62', 152, 17, 27, 294686) He showed how the Harijans stood to gain by people espousing

('62', 153, 8, 12, 295391) WARDHA, November 11, 1933
('62', 153, 9, 13, 295417) MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL, I have just returned from a heavy tour programme and having read your letter telegraphed as follows: 2
('62', 153, 10, 14, 295540) It is impossible to give more than one day and more then three hours.
('62', 153, 10, 15, 295610) It is difficult enough even to give three hours.
('62', 153, 10, 16, 295659) The programme is so packed that hardly any time is given for rest.
('62', 153, 10, 17, 295726) Four hours for rest, bath and dinner, have hitherto dwindled down to two.
('62', 153, 10, 18, 295800) A programme in which tens of thousands of people are concerned cannot easily be postponed or disturbed.
('62', 153, 10, 19, 295904) The enclosed copy 3 will give you an idea of the work, and where you find hours of rest, except for Friday afternoon, they have been encroached upon, changing the time from 10 a.m.

('62', 153, 10, 22, 296118) I entirely agree with you that the proposed conversation will not clarify matters to any satisfactory extent.
('62', 153, 10, 23, 296228) If the A.I.C.C. meeting is held, I do not know how I shall be able to attend the sittings.
('62', 153, 10, 24, 296319) Will it not be better for me to abstain from attending?
('62', 153, 10, 25, 296375) If it is desirable, I will send my views in writing.
('62', 153, 10, 26, 296428) The opinion I have expressed in my public letter 4to you is becoming more and more confirmed.

('62', 154, 1, 3, 296779) It more than confirms Satisbabus letter.
('62', 154, 1, 4, 296820) I have heard from the Gove rnor.

('62', 154, 1, 9, 297087) In anything you do about Swaraj Bhawan, do you not think that you should consult the trustees and not merely inform them ?
('62', 154, 1, 10, 297210) I have not been able even to show your letter to Jamnalalji for sheer want of time.
('62', 154, 1, 11, 297294) He twits me by saying that as I am in Wardha you are ignoring him entirely, not even acknowledging his letters.
('62', 154, 1, 12, 297406) I told him that your letters to me are as much for him as for me and that just now the few of us who are out have little time for performing acts of mere cour tesy.
('62', 154, 1, 13, 297571) You cannot expect rapid progress for an old patient like Mother.
('62', 154, 1, 14, 297636) The wonder to me is that she has survived the attack she had.

('62', 154, 5, 19, 297852) WARDHA, November 11, 1933 I do not know what better proof any critic can demand than these meetings and demonstrations that untouchability is rapidly dis integrating.
('62', 154, 5, 20, 298019) This does not mean that the mass mind has changed altogether.
('62', 154, 5, 21, 298081) But if the evidence of the last four days is sustained throughout the tour I should feel certain about the cremation of the untouchabiliy monster within a measurable distance of time.

('62', 155, 1, 2, 298483) 173. SPEECH AT DEOLI 1
('62', 155, 2, 3, 298506) November 11, 1933 2
('62', 155, 3, 4, 298526) I am essentially a lover of peace.
('62', 155, 3, 5, 298561) I do not have the slightest wish to create dissensions among the Hindus.
('62', 155, 3, 6, 298634) It would be best for the sana tanists and reformers to confer among themselves and make an effort to arrive at an understanding.
('62', 155, 3, 7, 298763) But if that effort fails, both parties should resort to peaceful and honourable methods and both should learn to tolerate one another.
('62', 155, 3, 8, 298898) I believe myself to be both a sanatanist and a reformer.
('62', 155, 3, 9, 298955) I have tried to gather in me all the goodwill which caste Hindus can have towards Harijans.
('62', 155, 3, 10, 299047) God alone knows how far I have succeded in the effort.
('62', 155, 3, 11, 299102) I am also trying, as best as an imperfect human being like myself can, to see with Harijans eyes and to realize what is going on in their hearts.
('62', 155, 3, 12, 299248) It is not given to man to know the whole truth.
('62', 155, 3, 13, 299296) His duty lies in living up to the truth as he sees it and, in doing so, to resort to the purest means, i.e, to non violence.
('62', 155, 3, 14, 299421) I do not want to hurt the feelings of the sanatanists.
('62', 155, 3, 15, 299476) I want to convert them to my view in the gentlest manner.
('62', 155, 3, 16, 299534) I want, if I can, to steal into their hearts.
('62', 155, 3, 17, 299580) I would love to melt their hearts by my suffering.
('62', 155, 3, 18, 299631) I firmly believe that untouchability as we practise it today has no sanction in the Shastras.
('62', 155, 3, 19, 299725) But I do not wish to enter into a discussion of what the Shastras support and what they do not.
('62', 155, 3, 20, 299821) I only put before you, as humbly as I can, the truth as I see it, and am prepared to sacrifice my life, if need be, in an unceasing effort to live up to that truth.
('62', 155, 3, 21, 299986) It is clear to my mind, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that, if untou chabi lity is not eradicated, both Hinduism and the Hindus are bound to perish.
('62', 155, 3, 22, 300135) Ever since I was a child of ten I have considered untoucha bility as a sin.
('62', 155, 3, 23, 300211) My heart has never been able to reconcile itself to untouchability based on birth.
('62', 155, 3, 24, 300294) I tried to study the Shastras to the best of my ability.
('62', 155, 3, 25, 300351) I consulted as many pundits as I could.
('62', 155, 3, 26, 300391) And a majority of them have supported my view.
('62', 155, 3, 27, 300438) But truth is not to be found in books.
('62', 155, 3, 28, 300477) Truth resides in every human heart, and one has to search for
('62', 155, 4, 29, 300539) 1 Gandhiji had gone to Deoli to open a temple to Harijans but some sanatanists opposed the plan.
('62', 155, 4, 30, 300636) A shastri form the South requested him to stop the movement and avoid creating dissensions in Hindu society.

('62', 156, 1, 3, 300869) But no one has a right to coerce others to act according to his own view of truth.
('62', 156, 1, 4, 300952) I would appeal to the temple goers here who are in favour of Harijans entry into the temple to go into the temple only after the sanatanists, who have blocked the way, leave the place.
('62', 156, 1, 5, 301137) We do not want to score a victory over them.
('62', 156, 1, 6, 301182) Do not be angry with them, do not insult them; on the contrary, feed them if they are hungry and would accept your hospitality.
('62', 156, 1, 7, 301310) We have to win them over by love.
('62', 156, 1, 8, 301344) We may not ask for police aid against them.
('62', 156, 2, 9, 301388) I do not say this because I am a non co operator but because I believe in the law of non retaliation.
('62', 156, 2, 10, 301490) Again, I believe that religion can never be protected by force or hooliganism, but by penace and suffering.
('62', 156, 2, 11, 301598) I am, therefore, prepared to give up my life, if need be, as a final act of penance.
('62', 156, 3, 12, 301683) He hoped that those who were arrested would be discharged and that the temple would be opened to Harijans without delay and without friction.

('62', 156, 5, 15, 301866) Shri Harakhchand writes in his letter 2 of October 26. I hope readers will not be annoyed with me for giving all this description.
('62', 156, 5, 16, 301997) It is not proper if somemone says that it is an old story or that the floods are a past event.
('62', 156, 5, 17, 302092) When the floods came, those who were destined to die died.
('62', 156, 5, 18, 302151) Those who survived immediately got all possible help.
('62', 156, 5, 19, 302205) But it becomes the moral obligation ot the kind hearted to look after those who were rendered homeless till the next season is over and the new harvest is ready.
('62', 156, 5, 20, 302367) Such letters prove that this is the right time for fulfilling this duty.
('62', 156, 5, 21, 302440) Readers will find that in some places the rice given per head is less than what even one pice can fetch.
('62', 156, 5, 22, 302545) If this picture is clearly im pressed on his mind, the reader would not be happy to partake of his meal without keeping aside a part of it for such unhappy people.
('62', 156, 5, 23, 302709) If all contributed according to their capacity, thousands will get en ough to keep themselves alive.
('62', 156, 5, 24, 302810) Millowners can send clothes.

('62', 157, 8, 14, 303562) One who repents deserves to be forgiven.
('62', 157, 8, 15, 303603) Do not say a word [of reproach] to Ganga; receive her with love.
('62', 157, 8, 16, 303668) The ornaments have to be brought back, that she will do.
('62', 157, 8, 17, 303725) You can send her back afterwards.
('62', 157, 8, 18, 303759) Remain calm, chant Ramanama.
('62', 157, 8, 19, 303788) We are all prone to errors but those who confess theirs are blessed.

('62', 158, 2, 3, 304085) WARDHA, November 13, 1933
('62', 158, 3, 4, 304111) MANILAL AND SUSHILA, I cannot reply immediately to your letters.
('62', 158, 3, 5, 304176) I dont have time even today, but have found some to write this letter as Kishorelal told me the substance of your letter to Nanabhai.
('62', 158, 3, 6, 304310) If I could, I would cer tainly have tried to guide you in regard to the dispute among you there.
('62', 158, 3, 7, 304407) 1 But I really cannot judge in such matters unless I see all the people concerned.
('62', 158, 3, 8, 304490) However, why do you always feel dependent on me ?
('62', 158, 3, 9, 304540) Go on doing fearlessly what you feel to be the right thing.
('62', 158, 3, 10, 304600) Dont mind if you make mistakes.
('62', 158, 3, 11, 304632) Whenever you realize that you have made a mistake, rectify it unhesitatingly without thinking of the conse quences.
('62', 158, 3, 12, 304748) If you always act thus, you will be able to judge what the right course is in every matter.
('62', 158, 3, 13, 304840) I shall not live for ever.
('62', 158, 3, 14, 304867) You should try to swim with your own strength.
('62', 158, 3, 15, 304914) That is the right thing to do.
('62', 158, 3, 16, 304945) Dont mind if you drown while trying to swim.
('62', 158, 3, 17, 304990) If you realize that you have made a mistake in adopting the course which you are following at present, you should abandon it.
('62', 158, 3, 18, 305116) If you dont see any mistake, you must cling to it no matter even if you die or become a pauper in con sequence.
('62', 158, 3, 19, 305228) But, while doing that, do not get angry with anybody or adopt untruthful means or lose your peace of mind or patience.
('62', 158, 3, 20, 305347) Bear the hardships which may follow.
('62', 158, 3, 21, 305384) Instead of seeking the protection of an imperfect father, seek that of the Father of all, of Omnipotent God.
('62', 158, 3, 22, 305493) That will make you strong.
('62', 158, 3, 23, 305520) This is the only lesson I wish to teach you.
('62', 158, 3, 24, 305565) If you have learnt it, you may rest assured that you have received perfect education.
('62', 158, 3, 25, 305651) You will read accounts of my tour in papers and elsewhere.

('62', 159, 2, 4, 305999) They have become cowards.
('62', 159, 2, 5, 306025) They are not prepared for sacrifice; they do not wish to purify temselves nor do they want to give up their bad habits.

('62', 159, 2, 7, 306172) 1 In these circumstances, those of us who are awakened should do their duty by purifying themselves through sacrifice and have the faith that therein lies the ultimate solution of the problem.

('62', 160, 3, 4, 307262) DEAR JAWAHARLAL, I have just arrived in Chanda and whilst the others are coming, I have taken up your letter.
('62', 160, 3, 5, 307372) It is now 9 p.m.
('62', 160, 3, 6, 307389) The programme is fairly strenuous.
('62', 160, 3, 7, 307424) I was in Hinganghat at 6 p.m.
('62', 160, 3, 8, 307454) Tiwari has handed me your letter.
('62', 160, 3, 9, 307488) I have also read yours to J 1. So far as he knows there is probably very little left in A.I.C.C. a/c.
('62', 160, 3, 10, 307590) The books are not with him.
('62', 160, 3, 11, 307618) He has sent for the accounts.
('62', 160, 3, 12, 307648) Meanwhile I have suggested that Rs. 500 might be sent at least on a/c.
('62', 160, 3, 13, 307719) If the funds are exhausted, I do not know what is to be done.
('62', 160, 3, 14, 307781) I have an earmarked a/c at my disposal.
('62', 160, 3, 15, 307821) I am loath to part with that fund.
('62', 160, 3, 16, 307856) I am drawing upon it for Hardikar and I want to do likewise for the list of workers you have sent me.
('62', 160, 3, 17, 307958) It too will be soon exhausted.
('62', 160, 3, 18, 307989) In the circumstances, the office staff has to be reduced if not given up altogether, i.e., if the civil resistance movement is to continue.
('62', 160, 3, 19, 308129) The more I look about me, the more convinced I feel that those who are in the fight will have to do without funds except such as may remain in hands such as mine.
('62', 160, 3, 20, 308292) I have just managed for Gujarat and Karnatak.
('62', 160, 3, 21, 308338) The lady who was to have paid Rs. 50,000 has just sent the message that she would like to pay Rs. 10,000 to you.
('62', 160, 3, 22, 308451) If she does, I shall expect you to pay the U.P. workers out of this.
('62', 160, 3, 23, 308520) Anyway I think it is best for you to confer with Jamnalalji and if necessary with me as to the management of the funds that are still available.
('62', 160, 3, 24, 308665) I have sent notices everywhere that no more help need be expected through me.
('62', 160, 3, 25, 308743) I am trying to run through what ever is at my disposal.
('62', 160, 3, 26, 308799) Now about the informal meeting.
('62', 160, 3, 27, 308831) You will see from the pro gramme herewith that I am in Delhi between 10 and 14 December.
('62', 160, 3, 28, 308920) Thakkar Bapa says I can take up the bulk of 14th for our meeting.
('62', 160, 3, 29, 308986) I am supposed to entrain for Andhra on 14th immediately after 4 p.m.
('62', 160, 3, 30, 309055) Ansari who was with me on Sunday suggested Delhi.
('62', 160, 3, 31, 309105) You will now make your choice24th inst., 4th Dec.

('62', 161, 1, 2, 309327) As to the Harijan tour, I am not worrying at all over the pro posed boycott in U.P. I am finding no difficulty here.
('62', 161, 1, 3, 309444) Congressmen and non Congressmen are co operating in arranging for the tour.
('62', 161, 1, 4, 309520) You are unnecessarily hard on the liberals whom I would include among non Congressmen.
('62', 161, 1, 5, 309607) We have to get work even from them.
('62', 161, 1, 6, 309643) They work according to their lights.
('62', 161, 1, 7, 309680) In any case, I do not want a single Congressman to work for this movement who would go to jail.
('62', 161, 1, 8, 309776) I have said this to everyone who has come to me.
('62', 161, 1, 9, 309825) I am sending back some of the best workers who have just come out.
('62', 161, 1, 10, 309892) Ba I hope is going soon and so is Manibehn Patel.
('62', 161, 1, 11, 309942) Kakasaheb, Swami, Surendra are going.
('62', 161, 1, 12, 309980) Those Congressmen who are too weak to go or who have lost faith in civil disobedience and who are anxious to work for the Harijan cause I am taking, but not those who want Harijan work as a mere cloak.
('62', 161, 1, 13, 310182) This movement, if it is to become universal, must be able to continue even if every Congressman is in jail or it must perish.
('62', 161, 1, 14, 310308) I feel too that congressmen should not handle this movement to strengthen the C. D. movement or the Congress hold on the people.
('62', 161, 1, 15, 310437) It would be going about it the wrong way.
('62', 161, 1, 16, 310479) Such an attitude will damage both the Con gress and the Harijan cause.
('62', 161, 1, 17, 310550) Cases of this type have come under my notice.
('62', 161, 1, 18, 310596) I have expressed strong disapproval of any such work.
('62', 161, 1, 19, 310650) I think I have now sufficiently answered all your questions.
('62', 161, 1, 20, 310711) If not, please ask again.
('62', 161, 1, 21, 310737) You will have noticed that the Sarkar Salaam 1 in Hijli has stopped.
('62', 161, 1, 22, 310806) Shall I write to Sir Tej about the Frontier treatment ?
('62', 161, 1, 23, 310862) I had a nice letter from Krishna.
('62', 161, 1, 24, 310896) She seems to be happy in her new home.

('62', 162, 8, 10, 311437) RAMNIKLAL, You seem to be worrying about Tara.
('62', 162, 8, 11, 311484) I hope this is a polite way of saying things.
('62', 162, 8, 12, 311530) You and I cant afford to worry seriously.
('62', 162, 8, 13, 311572) If we do, we would discredit the knowledge that we profess.
('62', 162, 8, 14, 311632) How would it seem if we, who recite the Gita daily and read in it that we should not worry, still go on worrying every day about something or the other ?
('62', 162, 8, 15, 311786) I met Tara.
('62', 162, 8, 16, 311798) I liked her attitude, etc., very much.
('62', 162, 8, 17, 311837) About her dental trouble, she is trying some treatment.
('62', 162, 8, 18, 311893) Surendra told me everything about you.
('62', 162, 8, 19, 311932) These days all of us are being tested well.
('62', 162, 8, 20, 311976) We may call it the primary test.
('62', 162, 8, 21, 312009) I am writing this letter while touring.
('62', 162, 8, 22, 312049) I rose at three in the morn ing and, after brushing the teeth, the first thing I am doing is this.

('62', 162, 8, 24, 312204) We shall leave for Saoli at six.

('62', 162, 8, 26, 312291) The party going to Saoli is a large one.
('62', 162, 8, 27, 312332) it includes Janakibehn, Radhakishan 2 , Dhotre and others.

('62', 163, 1, 7, 312847) If I had the time, I would write a long letter.
('62', 163, 1, 8, 312895) I do not, cannot, write to you and to many others.

('62', 163, 8, 20, 313336) TARA, I had promised to give you a letter to Ramniklal, but I think I could not do so and I had been feeling unhappy because of that.
('62', 163, 8, 21, 313470) I had decided to write the letter the first thing this morning.
('62', 163, 8, 22, 313534) It 1 is en closed.
('62', 163, 8, 23, 313553) When will Ramniklal get it now?
('62', 163, 8, 24, 313585) Write to me always at Wardha.
('62', 163, 8, 25, 313615) Let me know what you do regarding the teeth.

('62', 163, 8, 27, 313777) I hope you have made it a regular practice to read Harijanbandhu.
('62', 163, 8, 28, 313843) Do you know that Om is accompanying me on the tour?
('62', 163, 8, 29, 313895) There are many others also just now, up to Saoli.
('62', 163, 8, 30, 313945) We are learning many things.

('62', 164, 2, 3, 314237) CHANDA, November 14, 1933
('62', 164, 3, 4, 314263) BHAI VALLABHBHAI, I must have your letters regularly.
('62', 164, 3, 5, 314317) You have made me grow accustomed to them.
('62', 164, 3, 6, 314359) We are in Chanda today.
('62', 164, 3, 7, 314383) it is four oclock just now.
('62', 164, 3, 8, 314411) At six we leave for Saoli.
('62', 164, 4, 9, 314438) I didnt like the manner in which things were done regarding Vithalbhai.
('62', 164, 4, 10, 314510) All the same, I have learnt much from here, from the way in which people attended in large crowds.
('62', 164, 4, 11, 314609) They dont worship the man.
('62', 164, 4, 12, 314636) They worship, in their own way and on their own terms, the image of the man which they have formed in their minds and which they love.
('62', 164, 4, 13, 314771) I have not read the accounts in papers and do not know details.
('62', 164, 4, 14, 314835) But I have got a complete picture in my mind of the whole thing.
('62', 164, 4, 15, 314900) I learnt from The Times [of India] about eggs having been thrown during the students meeting 1 in Nagpur.I didnt see anything in the hall.
('62', 164, 4, 16, 315039) I didnt even see any commotion anywhere.
('62', 164, 4, 17, 315080) Nor do I know anybody else in the hall having noticed anything.
('62', 164, 4, 18, 315144) Chandra shankar told me only this, that an egg had fallen on Om.
('62', 164, 4, 19, 315209) Nobody knows whether it was aimed at her or the ex president sitting by her side or at me.
('62', 164, 4, 20, 315300) The truth is that the paper has magnified the incident out of all proportion.
('62', 164, 4, 21, 315378) The students love was beyond words.
('62', 164, 4, 22, 315414) They even gave me a purse of Rs. 700. It is the same in the case of U.P. Ansari came and saw me on Sunday.
('62', 164, 4, 23, 315521) [His] health is a little better.
('62', 164, 4, 24, 315554) [He] wished to see Vithalbhai, but could not.
('62', 164, 4, 25, 315600) During the last days he had become very restless.
('62', 164, 4, 26, 315650) Ansari had nothing in particular to say.
('62', 164, 4, 27, 315691) He had come only to pay a formal visit.
('62', 164, 4, 28, 315731) He has gone to see some patients in princely families.
('62', 164, 4, 29, 315786) He left the same evening.
('62', 164, 4, 30, 315812) I w as observing silence then, though not when he arrived.
('62', 164, 4, 31, 315871) So far I have experienced no difficulty in the tour.
('62', 164, 4, 32, 315924) It is now time for my meal and then to get into a car.
('62', 164, 4, 33, 315979) So I must stop here today.

('62', 165, 7, 9, 316382) MANI, I got your long letter.
('62', 165, 7, 10, 316412) You did well to speak out your mind.
('62', 165, 7, 11, 316449) You would only harm yourself if you hide your thoughts from me.
('62', 165, 7, 12, 316513) After a mans death, we must not remember his shortcomings, but should remember only his virtues.
('62', 165, 7, 13, 316610) My absence had nothing to do with his actions.
('62', 165, 7, 14, 316657) It is not that I fail to appreciate his virtues.
('62', 165, 7, 15, 316706) I did not go there because I could not have taken part in anything.
('62', 165, 7, 16, 316774) 2 I feel that at present I should be either in Yeravda or among Harijans.
('62', 165, 7, 17, 316848) When I say that I am out of prison only for the sake of Harijans, I do so not only for the benefit of the Government of the world but because that is how I relly feel in my heart.
('62', 165, 7, 18, 317028) I simply cannot take part in any other activity.
('62', 165, 7, 19, 317077) People also seem to have understood this.
('62', 165, 7, 20, 317119) I could not have tolerated the restrictions imposed by the Government and would not have been able to have things according to my own way.
('62', 165, 7, 21, 317258) I would not have been able to advise you or Dahyabhai.
('62', 165, 7, 22, 317313) And so I bore the attacks in silence.
('62', 165, 7, 23, 317351) Apart from this, there is another thing, too, in my life which you should know.
('62', 165, 7, 24, 317431) Rasik 3 was on his death bed and he even wished that I should be by his bedside.
('62', 165, 7, 25, 317512) But I did not go to Delhi, Ba did.
('62', 165, 7, 26, 317547) Rasik died.
('62', 165, 7, 27, 317559) I did not shed a single tear.
('62', 165, 7, 28, 317589) I was taking my meals when I received the wire.
('62', 165, 7, 29, 317637) I finished my meal and resumed my work.
('62', 165, 7, 30, 317677) There have been many such incidents in my life.
('62', 165, 7, 31, 317725) I have formed certain views about death and they are becoming stronger as the years pass.

('62', 166, 1, 5, 318188) If not, ask me again.
('62', 166, 1, 6, 318210) You have given a good description of the events there.
('62', 166, 1, 7, 318265) It was very painful.
('62', 166, 1, 8, 318286) We should understand the meaning of peoples love.
('62', 166, 1, 9, 318336) That love is not of the individual but of the virtues which they want to see in, and, therefore, attribute to him.
('62', 166, 1, 10, 318451) Their love, therefore, is a pure thing.
('62', 166, 1, 11, 318491) It is a sign of the popular awakening and an eye opener for the world.
('62', 166, 1, 12, 318562) Nobody can doubt that Vithalbhai was a lover of freedom.
('62', 166, 1, 13, 318619) Now about Ba.
('62', 166, 1, 14, 318633) If I had had time, I would have explained the point more clearly in that letter.
('62', 166, 1, 15, 318714) 1 Bas mind has weakened.
('62', 166, 1, 16, 318739) She wants and yet does not want to court arrest.
('62', 166, 1, 17, 318788) Deep down in her heart she knows that it is her duty to do so, and cannot forsake that duty, but she does not like to go as I am out.
('62', 166, 1, 18, 318922) I have not put any pressure.
('62', 166, 1, 19, 318951) I have left her free to do as she wishes.
('62', 166, 1, 20, 318993) What I wanted to say was that you should urge her and strengthen her resolution to do her duty, for she believes in you and loves you.
('62', 166, 1, 21, 319128) Anything I might say is likely to be regarded as an order and might kill her individuality.
('62', 166, 1, 22, 319220) I, therefore, tell her nothing.
('62', 166, 1, 23, 319252) But even my silence is interpreted by Ba to mean that I want her to go.
('62', 166, 1, 24, 319324) I understand [what you say] about your teeth and legs.

('62', 167, 3, 5, 319818) You can know my feelings and mind from my letter to Manibehn.
('62', 167, 3, 6, 319880) 1 What can I do when I am helpless?
('62', 167, 3, 7, 319916) Just as a soldier deprived of his sword is no good, so am I without civil disobedience.
('62', 167, 3, 8, 320004) Moreover my whole life has been pledged.
('62', 167, 3, 9, 320045) My pledge is either I would be in jail or would be immersed in Harijan work.
('62', 167, 3, 10, 320122) I cannot even think of any other activity.
('62', 167, 3, 11, 320165) The faults of Vithalbhai have departed with him.
('62', 167, 3, 12, 320214) He had many good qualities and it is the memory of these that we have to treasure.
('62', 167, 3, 13, 320297) You are per haps not aware that I wrote a letter to him and he sent me an affectio nate reply.
('62', 167, 3, 14, 320392) My personal relations with him were never strained.
('62', 167, 3, 15, 320444) Diffe rences of opinion never affect personal relations.
('62', 167, 3, 16, 320501) There is no need to explain all this to you.
('62', 167, 3, 17, 320546) But Manibehn writes that you and other nephews too are a little hurt; so I am offering this explanation to you.
('62', 167, 3, 18, 320658) I am very much perturbed as Vallabhbhai is in jail.
('62', 167, 3, 19, 320710) If he were out I would have left it to him to remove all family misunderstandings.
('62', 167, 3, 20, 320793) Because he is in jail the task of removing such misunderstandings falls on me all the more heavily.
('62', 167, 3, 21, 320893) Do not hesitate to write to me frankly if you feel that this explanation is not adequate.
('62', 167, 4, 22, 320983) Blessings from

('62', 168, 3, 4, 321243) RUKMINI, I had your letter.
('62', 168, 3, 5, 321271) Keep the rule.
('62', 168, 3, 6, 321286) I have started writing letters today at three in the morning immediately after rising.
('62', 168, 3, 7, 321373) These days I get up every day at three and write as many letters as I can in one hour.
('62', 168, 3, 8, 321460) We are leaving for Saoli today at six.
('62', 168, 3, 9, 321499) I shall be accompanied in the car up to Saoli by Janakibehn and the other grown ups.
('62', 168, 3, 10, 321584) Saoli is a big centre of khadi manufacture, where khadi work is carried on on our behalf.
('62', 168, 3, 11, 321674) I hope all of you are well.
('62', 168, 3, 12, 321702) I hear from your father in law 1
('62', 168, 4, 13, 321735) occasionally.

('62', 168, 9, 19, 321921) November 14, 1933 Gandhiji exhorted them to introduce improvements in their implements which would give them an increased output and a consequent increase in wages.
('62', 168, 9, 20, 322086) 2 He said.
('62', 168, 9, 21, 322097) Even then if you do not give up your bad habits, an increase in wages would not add to your happiness, for you will squander away what you will get.
('62', 168, 9, 22, 322246) What is necessary then, above all, is for you to purify your life, give up evil habits, and you will add not only to your resources but also to your well being.

('62', 169, 1, 2, 322550) 189. LETTER TO MATHURADAS TRIKUMJI
('62', 169, 2, 3, 322585) CHANDA, November 14, 1933 I should advise you not to put too much strain on your body.
('62', 169, 2, 4, 322672) It was not at all necessary for you to have run after the bier all the way.
('62', 169, 3, 5, 322748) It is not an absolute moral duty to do so.
('62', 169, 3, 6, 322791) I knew that my absence would be misunderstood, but why should I forsake my dharma for fear that others might not understand it ?
('62', 169, 3, 7, 322920) If I can live mentally outside jail, it can be only for Harijan work.
('62', 169, 3, 8, 322990) That being so, I can do nothing unconnected with such work.
('62', 169, 3, 9, 323050) Unable to offer civil disobedience, I am like a bird who has lost its wings.
('62', 169, 3, 10, 323127) I would not have been able to en dure some of the things which happened there.
('62', 169, 3, 11, 323206) Looking at the matter even from that point of view, therefore, I couldnt have come.
('62', 169, 3, 12, 323290) Moreover, the date for the commencemnt of the Harijan tour had already been fixed.
('62', 169, 3, 13, 323373) I didnt go to see Motilaljis widow.
('62', 169, 3, 14, 323409) I havent gone to see Ramis daughter, who is on her death bed.
('62', 169, 3, 15, 323471) Similarly, I am not going to visit Brijkishan, who is as dear to me as a son and who too is on his death bed.
('62', 169, 3, 16, 323581) 2 You should write to him.
('62', 169, 3, 17, 323608) Perhaps a wire may be necessary .
('62', 169, 3, 18, 323642) 3 I did not go to see Rasik when he was on his death bed.
('62', 169, 3, 19, 323700) I didnt go even after he died.
('62', 169, 3, 20, 323731) But I neednt tell you all this.
('62', 169, 3, 21, 323763) I have given a few instances thinking that perhaps you do not know about this aspect of my life.
('62', 169, 3, 22, 323860) In fact, even you need not reply to such charges against me.
('62', 169, 3, 23, 323921) Those who have failed to understand me till now will not be convinced by arguments.
('62', 169, 3, 24, 324005) We must trust to the effect which my life as a whole may produce.
('62', 169, 3, 25, 324071) Our deeds will have their effect sooner or later.
('62', 169, 3, 26, 324121) No arguments can prevent them.
('62', 169, 3, 27, 324152) Your not coming did not please me.
('62', 169, 3, 28, 324187) I had thought that you would suddenly turn up on Sunday without previous intimation.
('62', 169, 3, 29, 324272) It seems that there will be no meeting 4. If it is held, it will be in Delhi on December 14. Ansari wants it to be on that day.
('62', 169, 3, 30, 324400) If so, you should attend.

('62', 170, 1, 3, 324663) The article 1 in Harijan seems to have brought some money.
('62', 170, 1, 4, 324722) You need not worry about this problem.
('62', 170, 1, 5, 324761) There is no necessity at all for you to strain your health.
('62', 170, 1, 6, 324821) As one should avoid indolence, so also should one avoid excessive work.
('62', 170, 1, 7, 324893) The verse , etc., 2 is ever fresh in my mind.

('62', 170, 5, 15, 325365) But I have told him that this may be done only if you approve of the plan and agree to help.
('62', 170, 5, 16, 325458) A sum of not less than Rs. 5,000 should be collected for this fund, and it may be given to me in Chandwara in the form of a purse.
('62', 170, 5, 17, 325589) A small committee may be formed for the purpose and the money may be spent for Harijan uplift in consultation with me.
('62', 170, 5, 18, 325708) If you approve of this plan, help and guide Shri Harkare accordingly.

('62', 171, 2, 3, 326044) November 15, 1933 I tell you, if you do not know already, that my friendship with Bapuji Aney has grown with years.
('62', 171, 2, 4, 326160) I can give you many remini scences of his sweet manners and brevity pf speech, his resourceful ness and industry.
('62', 171, 2, 5, 326274) I cannot conceal from you my grief at his enforced absence 1 from our midst today.
('62', 171, 2, 6, 326357) I was not prepared to hear this 2 from you, I want an unsoiled cowrie from you, which means, I want you to sacrifice a little of your comforts to spare money for the Harijans.
('62', 171, 2, 7, 326533) I do not think any one of you denied yourself, out of sympathy with the flood stricken people, a single meal or a single comfort.
('62', 171, 2, 8, 326663) If that be true, it does not behove you to plead inability when asked to contribute to this cause, which is one of penance and purification for us, caste Hindus.

('62', 171, 5, 13, 327058) If we want to be just to the whole world we have to be just to the Harijans.
('62', 171, 5, 14, 327135) Ever since I set foot on the soil of Berar, the name of Bapuji Aney is reverberating in my ears.
('62', 171, 5, 15, 327232) After years of comradeship a friendship has grown between us, the measure of which I cannot describe to you adequately.

('62', 172, 2, 3, 327663) AMRAOTI, (AS AT WARDHA) November 16, 1933
('62', 172, 3, 4, 327705) MY DEAR AGATHA, I had your long letter.
('62', 172, 3, 5, 327745) I see that you are ever thinking of Andrews as a good mother would think of her son, looking after him and anticipating his wants and protecting him from all harm.
('62', 172, 3, 6, 327909) You are quite right in saying that without some such care his anxiety complex overtakes him and he then suffers, and his work with him.
('62', 172, 3, 7, 328045) Nevertheless, if you feel that for more efficient work you should come to India for a month or two, you should not hesitate.
('62', 172, 3, 8, 328170) In this, both he and I agreed, but he is there on the spot and you will do what you think proper after consultation with him and other friends.
('62', 172, 3, 9, 328314) Not that at the present moment any substantial work can be done.
('62', 172, 3, 10, 328379) Sir Samuel Hoare has made up his mind about everything.
('62', 172, 3, 11, 328435) He believes in his mission.
('62', 172, 3, 12, 328463) He almost thinks that we are incapable of looking after our own affairs or even knowing what is good for us.
('62', 172, 3, 13, 328572) He will not let us make mistakes.
('62', 172, 3, 14, 328606) The immediate needs of the Britishers blind him to the realities.
('62', 172, 3, 15, 328672) I feel that, in these circumstances, friends over there can do very little beyond watching, waiting and praying.
('62', 172, 3, 16, 328785) We must look after ourselves, and if we succeed in demonstrably helping ourseleves, you over there will be able to do substantial work.
('62', 172, 3, 17, 328921) Hijli affair seems to have been satisfactorily settled.
('62', 172, 3, 18, 328977) I suppose I am right in presuming that my very simple letter to the Governor of Bengal had its effect.
('62', 172, 3, 19, 329080) It may be said that the funeral ceremony over the remains of Vithalbhai Patel passed off fairly well.
('62', 172, 3, 20, 329182) So far as the public were con cerned they demonstrated in an unmistakable manner what they stood for.
('62', 172, 3, 21, 329284) The procession is described in Anglo Indian papers to have been at least a mile long.
('62', 172, 3, 22, 329370) The whole of Bombay turned out to do honour to the memory of the deceased.
('62', 172, 3, 23, 329445) They identified themselves with the cause for which he stood, viz., Indias unadulterated Independence, not of association with Britain but undoubtedly of the slightest con 
('62', 173, 0, 1, 329618) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 174
('62', 173, 1, 2, 329660) That the people are today helpless and unable to help themselves does not affect their mentality.
('62', 173, 1, 3, 329758) They know what they want and they seize every occasion that offers to them to let the world know their mind.
('62', 173, 1, 4, 329867) I wish you would succeed in bringing Subhas Bose to England.
('62', 173, 1, 5, 329928) I am dictating this during the few minutes that I have at my disposal before motoring away to the next destination.
('62', 173, 1, 6, 330044) I know you had last week an accurate letter from Chandrashankar Shukla.
('62', 173, 1, 7, 330116) I am not going to put the strain on him by sending you another descriptive letter.
('62', 173, 1, 8, 330199) The same demonstrations and enthusiasm continue unabated.
('62', 173, 1, 9, 330257) I do feel that untouchability is going much more swiftly than many may imagine.
('62', 173, 1, 10, 330337) No less than 1,50,000 people must have taken part in the numerous meetings and demonstrations.
('62', 173, 1, 11, 330432) If they did not want to endorse the movement, one would think that they could not possibly have attended in such large numbers.
('62', 173, 1, 12, 330560) They know that at the present moment I am touring solely in regard to untouchability, and that no political mission is mixed up with it, and yet they attend, and, in spite of the very hard times we are going through, they give their pices and their rupees.
('62', 173, 1, 13, 330817) It is, therefore, sad to think that the Anglo Indian papers are seeking to minimize the importance of the tour and even seeking to discredit it.
('62', 173, 1, 14, 330962) I wonder if they had telegraphed to you the so called egg throwing incident at Nagpur and the preparations for boycott in the U.P. I enclose cuttings about the incident and my very brief reply.
('62', 173, 1, 15, 331156) Of course, the sanatanists opposition is undoubtedly there.
('62', 173, 1, 16, 331216) But, up till now I have not noticed any support being given to them by the public at large.
('62', 173, 1, 17, 331308) The sanatanists would not have hesitated to damage the movement if they had any public support worth the name.
('62', 173, 1, 18, 331419) More I have not the time to say.
('62', 173, 1, 19, 331452) But you must read Harijan as part of my weekly lettter.
('62', 173, 1, 20, 331508) Distribute it as much as you like, and if you want more copies you can have them for the asking.
('62', 173, 1, 21, 331605) And you may take it that it will hide nothing of the opposition to the movement.
('62', 173, 1, 22, 331686) I have refrained from dealing with the egg throwing question and the opposition in the U.P., in the pages of the Harijan, first, because I have dealt with the two things in the public press, and secondly, because they have no bearing on the movement.
('62', 173, 1, 23, 331937) They have a political bearing in the sense that the Anglo Indian newspapers are resorting to unscrupulous tactics.
('62', 173, 1, 24, 332052) But I do not want to deal with such things in the pages of the

('62', 174, 1, 2, 332162) Harijan.
('62', 174, 1, 3, 332171) I want it to be free from political controversy even though just now I am out of prison.
('62', 174, 1, 4, 332260) Immediately I am inside prison walls I may not take notice of any politics even though they may have profound influence upon the Harijan movement.
('62', 174, 1, 5, 332407) And I am trying as much as it is humanly possible to act as if I was a prisoner.
('62', 174, 1, 6, 332488) If, however, you find any omissions in the Harijan or my letters, you will not hesitate to draw my attention to such omission.
('62', 174, 1, 7, 332615) I take it that you will share this letter with the friends who, you think, should see it.

('62', 174, 6, 12, 332813) MY DEAR EFY, I have your letter with the very beautiful card which you want me to keep in my copy of the Bhagavad Gita.
('62', 174, 6, 13, 332933) I am not going to carry out your wish literally, for, that will defeat it.
('62', 174, 6, 14, 333008) I do not read from the Gita every day.
('62', 174, 6, 15, 333047) I listen to its reading in the morning.
('62', 174, 6, 16, 333087) And since your idea, I take it, is that I should have the picture daily as a book mark I propose to keep it in the book which I may be reading for the time being and transfer it from book to book.
('62', 174, 6, 17, 333284) I see that you are having Gujarati lessons, probably from Manu, for, you have addressed your name in Gujarati.
('62', 174, 6, 18, 333395) I am glad that you are coming in close touch with Manu and Elizabeth.
('62', 174, 6, 19, 333465) You ask me what I wish about this love affair.
('62', 174, 6, 20, 333512) I regard both as very lovable, very sincere and very earnest, but what I fear is that they do not measure the full consequences of the proposed marriage.
('62', 174, 6, 21, 333666) I thoroughly appreciate their viewpoint.
('62', 174, 6, 22, 333707) For them it is enough that they love each other.
('62', 174, 6, 23, 333756) But I have always held that whilst young people should first make their choice, its finality should be dependent upon the approval and blessings of the elders.
('62', 174, 6, 24, 333916) I have seen young love so often disappointed in after years.
('62', 174, 6, 25, 333977) However deliberate the choice, somehow or other later years proved the choice to have been ill made.
('62', 174, 6, 26, 334078) In this case I see grave danger ahead.
('62', 174, 6, 27, 334117) The most fatal objection, however, that I can see to this proposed match is that Elizabeth desires,
('62', 175, 0, 1, 334217) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 176
('62', 175, 1, 2, 334259) and from her own standpoint perhaps naturally so, that the progeny should be brought up in the Roman Catholic faith.
('62', 175, 1, 3, 334376) I do not mind it at all.
('62', 175, 1, 4, 334401) But, even though Manu may have no objection, his parents and his people whom he loves dearly will never be able to reconcile themselves to their grandchildren being brought up in a faith other than their own.
('62', 175, 1, 5, 334610) Then there is the question of the whole Hindu culture.
('62', 175, 1, 6, 334665) I see, even at the present moment, a conflict going on between Hindu culture and the Christianity of Indians; the latter are being torn between two almost opposite attractions.
('62', 175, 1, 7, 334842) Somehow or other, Christ ianity has become synonymous with Western culture.
('62', 175, 1, 8, 334918) Perhaps rightly so, for, the religion of the Western people is predominantly Chris tianity and therefore Western culture may be fittingly described as Christaian culture as Indian culture would certainly be described as Hindu culture.
('62', 175, 1, 9, 335153) The progeny of Elizabeth must be brought up in en tirely different surroundings unless Manu decides to tear himself away from his own surroundings and lives an exclusive life or decides to settle down in the West.
('62', 175, 1, 10, 335367) I think that, spiritually considered, Elizabeth herself should not be a party to the possibility of Manu having to tear himself away.
('62', 175, 1, 11, 335501) Then there is the question of Elizabeth herself.
('62', 175, 1, 12, 335550) She would be hard put to it to accommodate herself to Indian surroundings.
('62', 175, 1, 13, 335625) Her constitution may be undermined or she would have to live a life out of all correspondence to her surroundings.
('62', 175, 1, 14, 335740) There is ample justification for Europeans saying that they cannot possibly exist in India without incurring expenses out of all proportion to the Indian average.
('62', 175, 1, 15, 335903) It is difficult enough even for Mira, in spite of her tremendous love for India, in spite of her iron will, to bend herself to the Indian simplicity, and Mira is the general average.
('62', 175, 1, 16, 336086) But even she has to be protected against herself and compel [led] to give herself facilities which her associates are not given.
('62', 175, 1, 17, 336215) She would have become bed ridden long ago if I had not laid down the law from the very first and I know that she has extraordinarliy accommodated herself to the Indian life.
('62', 175, 1, 18, 336389) But, even she would have failed completely if she had married an Indian and made the futile attempt of bringing up her children after the Indian style.
('62', 175, 1, 19, 336541) No body who has not lived in India like Indians can possibly have a conception of what I am writing.
('62', 175, 1, 20, 336642) India is the poorest country in the world.
('62', 175, 1, 21, 336685) And if is a tremendous job for a Western girl to come to India and marry an Indian with a fixed determination of living the essentially Indian life.
('62', 175, 1, 22, 336834) I do not recall a single Indian who has taken a
('62', 176, 0, 1, 336882) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 177
('62', 176, 1, 2, 336929) European girl for his wife living the life of the average Indian.
('62', 176, 1, 3, 336995) He simply cannot do it if he will do justice to his wife.
('62', 176, 1, 4, 337053) And I myself much less .
('62', 176, 1, 5, 337078) 1 reconciled to ourselves to Manu having lower his idea for the sake of Elizabeth.
('62', 176, 1, 6, 337161) 2 It is for reasons such as this I have cried out for celibacy for those who dedicate themselves completely to God, i.e., to the service of Gods creation.
('62', 176, 1, 7, 337316) There is no difficulty in my treating Mira as my daughter or you, but, imagine me having any European girl as daughter in law.
('62', 176, 1, 8, 337443) I should be frightened.
('62', 176, 1, 9, 337467) I could not shoulder the burden, because I could not reconcile myself to Devdas, for instance, having to tear himself away from his natural surroundings.
('62', 176, 1, 10, 337621) I feel it to be premature for Indians to contract marriage relations with Europeans.
('62', 176, 1, 11, 337706) When India has improved her conditions or when Euorpeans have boys and girls who have become inured to uttermost simplicity and have become domiciled in India I can look forward with happiness to Indo European marriages.
('62', 176, 1, 12, 337927) Now, I think, I have given you a long enough letter and ample matter for thought.
('62', 176, 1, 13, 338009) You know, at least somewhat, what I would wish, but I do not, in any shape or form, expect you to give effect to my wish, if what I have said does not appeal to you.
('62', 176, 1, 14, 338175) And, if you think otherwise about the future of Manu and Elizabeth, you will not hesitate to tell me so.
('62', 176, 1, 15, 338280) Whilst I deeply appreciate your losing yourself in me I would not be guilty of enslaving your reason or your heart.
('62', 176, 1, 16, 338396) Imperfect as I am, I would not have you to become a partner in my errors.
('62', 176, 1, 17, 338470) You must, therefore, exercise your full judgment in everything you do in association with me.
('62', 176, 1, 18, 338564) My love for you will be none the less for your differing with me when you feel the need for difference in thought speech or action.
('62', 176, 1, 19, 338696) I have not put before you one more thing that I have stated in my letter to Elizabeth.
('62', 176, 1, 20, 338783) I would simply state the proposition without arguing it.
('62', 176, 1, 21, 338840) I believe that, when husband and wife profess a different faith, the progeny should be brought up in the faith of the husband.
('62', 176, 1, 22, 338967) There are, to me, sound religious and philosophic reasons for this pro position.
('62', 176, 1, 23, 339048) If this proposition does not appear to be sound, you should

('62', 178, 2, 3, 340717) November 16, 1933 This vast gathering must have seen that there is no Godmade distinction between caste Hindus and Harijans.
('62', 178, 2, 4, 340842) 1 The distinction is purely man made, and is an offence in the eyes of God.
('62', 178, 2, 5, 340918) If the Harijans are given full opportunities for advancement, they will cer tainly equal, if they will not beat, others in many a field of life.
('62', 178, 2, 6, 341063) The sight we have witnessed this evening must be an eye opener to us and must inspire us to purge our hearts of the taint of untouchability.

('62', 178, 4, 8, 341224) 197. SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, AMRAOTI
('62', 178, 5, 9, 341263) November 16, 1933 I have visited many places throughout the length and breadth of this country and such big meetings are to me the manifestations of the grace of God.
('62', 178, 5, 10, 341430) I believe that with Gods favour only can we conduct such huge assemblies.
('62', 178, 5, 11, 341504) With His grace also I have taken up the Harijan work.
('62', 178, 5, 12, 341558) It is a religious work and should therefore be done with truth, peace and sacrifice.
('62', 178, 5, 13, 341643) It could not be done otherwise.
('62', 178, 5, 14, 341675) If we want to expiate for the injustice done to the Harijans and if we want to atone for the wrongs we, the savarna Hindus, are still doing them, we must treat them as we treat other savarna Hindus.
('62', 178, 5, 15, 341874) I would like to tell you all that, unless we behave with them on equal terms, there is no chance of our improvement also.
('62', 178, 5, 16, 341996) I visited the Harijan quarters with the help of Dr. Patwardhan, and have also seen other work here, and have now heard the address read out to me by the local Municipal Committee.
('62', 178, 5, 17, 342176) If the Municipality of this place could not do anything in this matter, it is not to be blamed.
('62', 178, 5, 18, 342272) I have seen many other municipal committees and the conditions are just the same all over.
('62', 178, 5, 19, 342363) But I must say that now even the Western scientists after their research have come to the conclusion that if we leave out any particular section of our society
('62', 178, 6, 20, 342523) 1 About a hundred Harijan boys had displayed their skill in physical drill before the gathering to the accompaniment of a band.
('62', 179, 0, 1, 342651) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 180
('62', 179, 1, 2, 342693) out of our fold, we are sure to go down economically.
('62', 179, 1, 3, 342747) After these 25 years of observations, my belief strengthened that wealth should always go hand in hand with religion.
('62', 179, 1, 4, 342865) There should be harmony between religion and wealth.
('62', 179, 1, 5, 342918) I have come to realize from my Harijan work that one who tries for wealth in accordance with religion gets both.
('62', 179, 1, 6, 343031) I believe it to be the duty of every savarna Hindu that he should try to take up the Harijan into his fold.
('62', 179, 1, 7, 343139) If we do our duty towards the Harijans, all of us Hindus, Moslems, Parsis,Christians, will live peacefully.
('62', 179, 1, 8, 343247) To my mind there is no better way to unity of these people than Harijan work.
('62', 179, 1, 9, 343325) Now I must tell you what every one of you can do in this respect.
('62', 179, 1, 10, 343391) The Harijan movement is a great yajna and each of you can put his little bit in it.
('62', 179, 1, 11, 343475) Those who have money can give it for this cause.
('62', 179, 1, 12, 343524) Those who have the leisure and intelligence to spare can teach the Harijan boys and give them lessons in personal hygiene and cleanliness.
('62', 179, 1, 13, 343663) The Congressmen are doing this work at present.
('62', 179, 1, 14, 343711) But I want that non Congressmen also should undertake this work.
('62', 179, 1, 15, 343776) It is the religious duty of every one of you to do this work.
('62', 179, 1, 16, 343838) I do not value politics as much as I value this work.
('62', 179, 1, 17, 343892) Politics is nothing to me.
('62', 179, 1, 18, 343919) It is my belief that if we do this work with religious fervour everything will be obtained.
('62', 179, 1, 19, 344011) I am not travelling with any other intention in this work.
('62', 179, 1, 20, 344070) And when I see people assemble in such large numbers to hear me, I hope they will stand by me in this work.
('62', 179, 1, 21, 344178) In July last the Harijan Sevak Sangh was started and some of you must have taken the vow to wipe out this curse of untouchability.
('62', 179, 1, 22, 344309) It is the birthright of the Harijans to make use of public institutions and to enter into the temples.
('62', 179, 1, 23, 344412) But as long as there is a single soul boycotted as being a Harijan, I shall not regard untouchability as being wiped out totally.
('62', 179, 1, 24, 344542) It is up to you, therefore, to change your hearts and consider the Harijans as your brethren.
('62', 179, 1, 25, 344636) The Harijan Sevak Sangh is composed of people of different schools of thought but they can do this work together.
('62', 179, 1, 26, 344750) The workers in this field should not aspire after any kind of honour or title.
('62', 179, 1, 27, 344829) They should not have the slightest tinge of personal interest or selfish motive.
('62', 179, 1, 28, 344910) This work should also be free from any sort of political meaning but I do not value political things as much as this.
('62', 179, 1, 29, 345028) The Harijan work is for the purification of the Hindu religion.
('62', 179, 1, 30, 345092) I have great hopes in this matter.
('62', 179, 1, 31, 345127) I have always been an optimist and my optimism
('62', 180, 0, 1, 345174) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 181
('62', 180, 1, 2, 345221) in this case is increasing every day.
('62', 180, 1, 3, 345259) But even if I fail it remains my duty to continue this work.
('62', 180, 1, 4, 345320) Very few sincere workers have so far come forward.
('62', 180, 1, 5, 345371) I, therefore, pray to God that He should give you all the necessary strength and guidance to do your duty in this respect.
('62', 180, 2, 6, 345494) I must remind you of the pledge given last year in your name.
('62', 180, 2, 7, 345556) You will remember that a meeting of representatives of Hindus was held in Bombay in September last year, Pandit Malaviyaji being in the chair.
('62', 180, 2, 8, 345699) Among other things they resolved that untouchability, being a blot on the Hindu religion, had to be removed and that Harijans were entitled to the same public utilities, and in the same manner, as caste Hindus.
('62', 180, 2, 9, 345910) There was in that resolution a special reference to Hindu temples, and legislation was contemplated if it was found to be necessary for attaining the end.
('62', 180, 2, 10, 346065) It is, therefore, the bounden duty of every caste Hindu to fulfil the pledge by throwing open to the Harijans temples, wells and other institutions precisely on the same terms as they are open to caste Hindus.
('62', 180, 2, 11, 346275) We are the cause of the degradation to which the Harijans are reduced.
('62', 180, 2, 12, 346346) We must spend money if the wrong is to be redressed.
('62', 180, 2, 13, 346399) He who will give to the cause will gain.
('62', 180, 2, 14, 346440) We may not be satisfied, therefore, with giving out of superfluous cash, we have to give even if we have to stint ourselves.
('62', 180, 2, 15, 346565) Some of us will have to give our all for Harijan service.
('62', 180, 2, 16, 346623) It gladdens me to find both Congressmen and non Congressmen working together in this movement.
('62', 180, 2, 17, 346718) Since questions are being asked as to how far Congressmen can join this movement, I would like to reiterate what I have said before.
('62', 180, 2, 18, 346851) The Congress adopted removal of untouchability as an integral part of its programme in 1920. It is, therefore, the duty of every Hindu Congressmen to fight untouchability and help Harijans in every way open to him.
('62', 180, 2, 19, 347066) But, if the movement were confined to Congressmen alone, it could not make the headway we all desire.
('62', 180, 2, 20, 347168) Every savarna Hindu has to do his bit in the movement.
('62', 180, 2, 21, 347223) But whilst every Congress member is expected to fight the evil, he or she is not expected officially to join the Harijan Seva Sangh.
('62', 180, 2, 22, 347356) If they are active civil resisters, they ought not to hold office in these organizations.
('62', 180, 2, 23, 347446) And no Congressmen who believes in and wants to offer civil resistance need in any way feel constrained to suspend or give it up altogether.
('62', 180, 2, 24, 347587) The case is wholly different with those who feel the call to give up civil resistance for the sake of Harijan service or

('62', 181, 1, 4, 347945) Harijans have complained that some self seekers have crept into the movement.
('62', 181, 1, 5, 348023) In a purely religious movement there is no room for such people.
('62', 181, 1, 6, 348088) Only those can or should take office who have the spirit of service in them.
('62', 181, 1, 7, 348165) Some of the ladies of this place have offered me ornaments and the little children have given me a little silver casket which I wish to put for auction.
('62', 181, 1, 8, 348318) I shall accept money from you all, be it even a cowrie but it should be given with a pure heart.

('62', 181, 9, 18, 348940) Gandhiji interviewed by the Associated Press, regarding a private report from America that he was going to New York in the spring season, denied having received any invitation to this effect.
('62', 181, 10, 19, 349132) He added that he had only recently declared to a Press correspondent his utter inability to go to America or elsewhere, stating that he would not depart from his vow of devoting his energy solely to the Harijan cause up to the end of next July.

('62', 182, 3, 4, 349752) Here the reader should stretch his imagination and ask himself what it must mean when people gladly walk miles to secure doles giving them less than one pice worth of rice per day and then search his heart as to whether he can honestly plead hard times when he is called upon to give a donation towards partially feeding the hungry skeletons of Orissa.
('62', 182, 3, 5, 350105) He must not expect a collector to go to him before he will part with his rupee or whatever sum he can give.
('62', 182, 3, 6, 350213) He should send his money order without delay.
('62', 182, 3, 7, 350259) Or he will, to save com mission, combine with his neighbours so as to send the maximum amount covered by the minimum commission.

('62', 182, 4, 9, 350408) 201. ADMIRABLE
('62', 182, 5, 10, 350423) The arrangements made by Dr. Khare and his Harijan Committee for the programme last week were admirable.
('62', 182, 5, 11, 350528) It could not have been got through even as it was, had not a very large number of willing and able companions helped Dr. Khare who never spared himself or them during those trying and strenuous days, although he has chronic heart trouble.
('62', 182, 5, 12, 350767) I understand that the heavy expenditure involved in having lofty electric lights and the solid platform at the huge mass meeting was met from voluntary contributions and was in no way a tax upon the purses presented.
('62', 182, 5, 13, 350984) My hosts house was for the time being turned into a dharmashala and Sjts.
('62', 182, 5, 14, 351058) Tikekar Brothers spared no pains or expenses in making happy and comfortable our large company and others who had come for numerous functions.
('62', 182, 5, 15, 351201) All Congessmen and non Congressmen seemed to me to have acted in perfect co operation for making the visit to Nagpur and the surrounding places the success it undoubtedly was.

('62', 183, 1, 2, 351608) congratulations to Dr. Khare and his colleagues for the efforts they unstintingly put forth on the occasion.
('62', 183, 1, 3, 351717) The great cause of purification deserved all the pains and vigilance given to it.

('62', 183, 3, 6, 351853) Workers desire further elucidation than I have already given in these columns as to the mode of using the donations that are being received during the Harijan tour.
('62', 183, 3, 7, 352018) I have conferred with Thakkar Bapa on the point and I can announce definitely that not less than 75 per cent will be used for Harijan service in the places where they are received, provided that a satisfactory budget is presented and the Central Board approves of it.
('62', 183, 3, 8, 352286) Indeed, even the full amount will be surrendered wherever it is found necessary to do so.
('62', 183, 3, 9, 352376) The only thing, therefore, to do is for workers in each centre to prepare businesslike schemes and produce honest and industrious persons for the due execution of the schemes, and the money will be forthwith coming as soon as needed.
('62', 183, 3, 10, 352610) There is no desire to lock up the donations or to deflect them without cause from the places where they are collected.
('62', 183, 3, 11, 352729) It is intended to keep a certain portion for the Central Board, but there, too, not for overhead charges, but for constructive work directly handled by it.

('62', 183, 6, 14, 352953) November 17, 1933 When I heard that your Anjuman had invited me, I was very glad.
('62', 183, 6, 15, 353035) I am very thankful to you for your kind address and for the purse you presented to me for Harijan work.
('62', 183, 6, 16, 353139) I was very glad to read the contents of your address.
('62', 183, 6, 17, 353193) You very rightly state that so long as untouchability remains there is no hope for Hinduism.
('62', 183, 6, 18, 353286) I have been with the Mussalmans all my life.
('62', 183, 6, 19, 353331) The great virtue which I find in Islam is that it teaches equality and brotherhood of man, be he king or slave.
('62', 183, 6, 20, 353443) Most of you must be Hafiz and must have read the Koran.
('62', 183, 6, 21, 353499) I have also tried to study and learn all the best in it.
('62', 183, 6, 22, 353556) What you have said about Hindu Muslim unity has appealed to me most.
('62', 183, 6, 23, 353625) I find that there are too many misunderstandings.
('62', 184, 0, 1, 353675) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 185
('62', 184, 1, 2, 353722) Hindus and Muslims cannot remain apart like this.
('62', 184, 1, 3, 353772) After all how long will this go on ?
('62', 184, 1, 4, 353809) I have found, however, that at present I have failed to bring unity but I surely see success in this failure.
('62', 184, 1, 5, 353919) It should also be remembered that unity does not mean joining powers to crush someone else.
('62', 184, 1, 6, 354011) If this is our idea of unity, we had better remain as we are.
('62', 184, 1, 7, 354073) At present I am only concentrating on Harijan work and have left this question for a time.
('62', 184, 1, 8, 354164) I can quite understand your anxiety to retain your culture.
('62', 184, 1, 9, 354224) You do not seem to believe in common educational institutions which, in your opinion, are calculated to lead you astray from your religious and cultural wealth.
('62', 184, 1, 10, 354385) I look on this question of sectarian education differently.
('62', 184, 1, 11, 354445) Common schools or communal schools do not matter with me.
('62', 184, 1, 12, 354503) What is the good of the common schools when prejudices create differences of heart ?
('62', 184, 1, 13, 354588) What harm is there in communal schools when there is purity of heart for all ?
('62', 184, 1, 14, 354667) So you will see that communal schools or common schools are of little importance.
('62', 184, 1, 15, 354749) Purity of heart, trust in each other and love for others are things more important than the question of sectarian education.
('62', 184, 1, 16, 354874) I really did not expect a purse from you.
('62', 184, 1, 17, 354916) More than this, I need your blessings to give me strength to fight untouchability.
('62', 184, 1, 18, 354999) I need your help to rid India of a great curse.
('62', 184, 1, 19, 355047) It is our common cause, not for India alone but for the whole world.
('62', 184, 1, 20, 355116) It is the service of humanity.
('62', 184, 1, 21, 355147) I am very thankful to you for your kind address and the purse presented to me.

('62', 184, 4, 24, 355297) November 17, 1933 I am grateful to you for the address you have presented and also for the purse and donations.
('62', 184, 4, 25, 355409) I thank the association of the Muslims for their purse.
('62', 184, 4, 26, 355465) During my visit to the Chokhamela 1 Harijan Boarding, the brothers gave me cash and the sisters rings.
('62', 184, 4, 27, 355568) I am thankful for these gifts as well.
('62', 184, 4, 28, 355607) I appreciate the good work you have done in Khamgaon and its neighbourhood for removing untouchability.

('62', 185, 0, 1, 355744) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 186
('62', 185, 1, 2, 355786) This evening, Thakkar Bapa has thrown open Udasijis 1 Siva temple to the Harijans in Lasoor.
('62', 185, 1, 3, 355879) He has performed this sacred task for the sake of our Harijan brethren.
('62', 185, 1, 4, 355951) I am told no Harijan was present on the occasion.
('62', 185, 1, 5, 356001) The Harijans are still suspicious because of the treatment we have meted out to them.
('62', 185, 1, 6, 356087) It is the duty of the Hindus, or of those who consider themselves caste Hindus, to do justice to them, and atone for the atrocities they have heaped on the Harijans in the past, and give up the ignorant belief prevalent today that the temples are meant for caste Hindus alone.
('62', 185, 1, 7, 356364) Udasiji has done his duty by this act.
('62', 185, 1, 8, 356403) Whether the Harijans come or not, we should discharge our duty towards them with love and the result is bound to be good.
('62', 185, 1, 9, 356525) When the Harijans are convinced that our invitation is prompted by love, they will come by themselves.
('62', 185, 1, 10, 356628) Here I wish to say one thing, that the law applicable to Hindus applies to Harijans as well.
('62', 185, 1, 11, 356721) Rules of public conduct and should be applicable to all alike.
('62', 185, 1, 12, 356784) Harijans should follow the rules for visiting public institutions.
('62', 185, 1, 13, 356851) They should keep their bodies clothes clean and follow the rule of personal cleanliness.
('62', 185, 1, 14, 356940) Harijans who eat carrion have no right to enter temples.
('62', 185, 1, 15, 356997) Having travelled widely, and after studying history, I have found that those who eat carrion are despised every where.
('62', 185, 1, 16, 357116) There is no doubt that those who are godfearing and in whom wisdom and purity have dawned can give it up.
('62', 185, 1, 17, 357222) Likewise, I request them to give up drinking.
('62', 185, 1, 18, 357268) I know that it can be argued that there are many among caste Hindus who take alcohol; but it is not right to follow them in their vices.
('62', 185, 1, 19, 357405) He who takes alcohol loses his humanity.
('62', 185, 1, 20, 357446) He even forgets the difference between mother, sister, daughter and wife.
('62', 185, 1, 21, 357520) Although by birth I am a caste Hindu, by choice I am a Harijan.
('62', 185, 1, 22, 357584) Therefore, from this point of view, considering myself a Harijan, I implore them to give up this vice.
('62', 185, 1, 23, 357687) I know that alcohol is used even in ther rituals.
('62', 185, 1, 24, 357737) This is what some pseudo pundits have taught them and they have believed it.
('62', 185, 1, 25, 357814) Therefore I beg of you to give up this vice which makes beast of man.
('62', 185, 1, 26, 357884) In fact, it is this thing which is untou chable.
('62', 185, 1, 27, 357933) In the same way.
('62', 185, 1, 28, 357950) Mahars, Chamars, Bhangis and others should do away with the distinctions amongst themselves.
('62', 185, 1, 29, 358043) This is the Harijans share of duty in this work of self purification.
('62', 185, 1, 30, 358113) Now, I wish to say something to the caste Hindus.
('62', 185, 1, 31, 358163) I also want to say what I conclude from this vast congregation that has gathered here
('62', 185, 2, 32, 358249) 1 Vishnudas Udasi
('62', 186, 0, 1, 358267) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 187
('62', 186, 1, 2, 358314) to hear my speech.
('62', 186, 1, 3, 358333) Ever since I returned to India, I do exactly as my conscience dictates.
('62', 186, 1, 4, 358405) Let no one imagine that I do one thing but have something else in my mind.
('62', 186, 1, 5, 358480) I claim to believe in God, whether you call him Khuda, Allah, or Ishwar.
('62', 186, 1, 6, 358553) I stand in awe before Him.
('62', 186, 1, 7, 358580) He is witness to all my work.
('62', 186, 1, 8, 358610) I have also taken a vow with Him as my witness that I shall do Harijan service in a truly religious spirit.
('62', 186, 1, 9, 358718) there are many things I can do, but if I did them it would be my downfall.
('62', 186, 1, 10, 358793) Out of the prison I wish to do only one thing; otherwise my life is false.
('62', 186, 1, 11, 358868) I consider myself a layman, but layman or learned, it is the duty of everyone of follow his dharma.
('62', 186, 1, 12, 358968) I consider this work a religious duty.
('62', 186, 1, 13, 359007) Whatever I have learnt from my parents and teachers and from my own experience, all this I would like to present before you.
('62', 186, 1, 14, 359132) I have had the reward of whatever service I have rendered before.
('62', 186, 1, 15, 359198) God alone can reward my service.
('62', 186, 1, 16, 359231) At the moment, I wish to work only for the removal of untouchability.
('62', 186, 1, 17, 359301) If you like my views you can come and if you do not like them you can avoid me.
('62', 186, 1, 18, 359381) During these days, I have felt your affection and therefore I shall bear it even if you abuse me today and, if you beat me I shall bear that also and shall pray to God to forgive you.
('62', 186, 1, 19, 359565) But if you do not agree with my views, courtesy demands that you should avoid coming here.
('62', 186, 1, 20, 359656) I however see that you come here, give money and jewellery gladly; I therefore take it that you are with me.
('62', 186, 1, 21, 359765) Are you paying my fees for the work I have already done ?
('62', 186, 1, 22, 359823) I do not require fees.
('62', 186, 1, 23, 359846) God gives me my reward.
('62', 186, 1, 24, 359870) But when you come here in such large numbers and help me with money, etc., I conclude that you are with me in whatever task I have undertaken now; that is, this has become the sanatan dharma today.
('62', 186, 1, 25, 360068) I have met a hundred and fifty thousand people today.
('62', 186, 1, 26, 360122) Are they all reformers ?
('62', 186, 1, 27, 360147) They are sanatanists and they are doing this work today.
('62', 186, 1, 28, 360204) If today you do not voluntarily take part in the removal of untouchability, tomorrow you will have to do it against your will.
('62', 186, 1, 29, 360331) When popular rule is established, do you think the Harijans can be prevented from entering schools or excluded from other rights ?
('62', 186, 1, 30, 360462) There was a time when people would not travel along with them in trains; why do they do it now ?
('62', 186, 1, 31, 360559) In the same way, I ask the mill owners whether they do not touch the untouchables ?
('62', 186, 1, 32, 360643) They do, but only for pecuniary gain.
('62', 186, 1, 33, 360681) There is no virtue in this.
('62', 186, 1, 34, 360709) I say what you are obliged to do for pecuniary gain, could you not do the same out of your own free will and because it is religious?
('62', 186, 1, 35, 360843) In the address presented to me on behalf of the Municipality, it is stated that we should give up the move to have the law regarding temple entry enacted, because many people think that legal inter 
('62', 187, 0, 1, 361042) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 188
('62', 187, 1, 2, 361084) ference is undesirable in religious matters.
('62', 187, 1, 3, 361129) I wish to tell them that the Harijans have as much right to go to the temples for worship as we have.
('62', 187, 1, 4, 361231) But the draft of the Bill which has been presented has no element of force at all.
('62', 187, 1, 5, 361314) On the other hand it seeks to remove the element of coercion which exists in the law as it is today.
('62', 187, 1, 6, 361415) I myself do not like interference by law in religious matters but how do these Bills interfere with religion ?
('62', 187, 1, 7, 361526) If any lawyer can prove this, I shall give it up; but I know for certain that this is not the case.
('62', 187, 1, 8, 361626) After all, I was myself a legal practitioner once upon a time.
('62', 187, 1, 9, 361689) Lawyers contend that, today even if the public wish to throw open a temple to the Harijans and the majority of the trustees also agrees to it, the temple cannot be thrown open even if a single trustee raises objection.
('62', 187, 1, 10, 361908) The law does not allow freedom for independent decision, and so it does amount to coercion.
('62', 187, 1, 11, 362000) The aim of this Bill is to remove this coercion.
('62', 187, 1, 12, 362049) Whatever fault there is in the law can only be removed by law; there is no other way.
('62', 187, 1, 13, 362135) It would have been interference with religion if by law all temples were to be thrown open; but there is no such provision in the Bill.
('62', 187, 1, 14, 362271) There is obviously no compulsion in this.
('62', 187, 1, 15, 362313) The temples can be thrown open only when the trustees or the public wish to do so.
('62', 187, 1, 16, 362396) If they do not, there is no compulsion.
('62', 187, 1, 17, 362436) At the Bombay Conference the Hindu leaders in the name of Hindu society took a pledge to secure for Harijans the right to have darshan of the idol.
('62', 187, 1, 18, 362584) The legal obstruction of fulfilling that vow is to be removed with the help of law.
('62', 187, 1, 19, 362668) That is all that this Bill means.
('62', 187, 1, 20, 362702) In this there is no interference by law in religion.
('62', 187, 1, 21, 362755) Now the members of the Municipality may ponder over my words.
('62', 187, 1, 22, 362817) When I visited the Harijans, they made several complaints and asked me whether I considered those who were doing Harijan work as true servants of the Harijans.
('62', 187, 1, 23, 362977) I replied that I did not know about the local workers but all those who join in any movement cannot be said to be good and truthful.
('62', 187, 1, 24, 363110) From their complaints I learnt that in Malkapur Harijans are not allowed the use of lavatories.
('62', 187, 1, 25, 363206) If this is true, what a grave injustice it is that those who clean the lavatories cannot use them.
('62', 187, 1, 26, 363305) Tomorrow if they stop cleaning them what can you do ?
('62', 187, 1, 27, 363359) Caste Hindus are not even so organized as to be able to take up mutual scavenging.
('62', 187, 1, 28, 363442) No good can result from such behaviour.
('62', 187, 1, 29, 363482) Similar complaints have been made about a place called Monar.
('62', 187, 1, 30, 363544) All others can bathe in the water that flows there but Harijans are prohibited from doing so.
('62', 187, 1, 31, 363638) They can bathe only in the unclean water drained after use by us for bathing.
('62', 187, 1, 32, 363716) I do not know how far this is true, but if it is
('62', 188, 0, 1, 363765) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 189
('62', 188, 1, 2, 363812) true it is a great disgrace.
('62', 188, 1, 3, 363841) Such water is unfit even for animals.
('62', 188, 1, 4, 363879) We wash even cattle with clean water.
('62', 188, 1, 5, 363917) Are these Harijan brethren worse than animals ?
('62', 188, 1, 6, 363965) What is their fault ?
('62', 188, 1, 7, 363987) And even if they have been at fault, is this the treatment which should be meted out to them ?
('62', 188, 1, 8, 364082) This has become our daily conduct.
('62', 188, 1, 9, 364117) Irreligion we have made our religion.
('62', 188, 1, 10, 364155) I shall also mention here the sad news from Rajputana that Harijans have to drink from the water stored for cattle.
('62', 188, 1, 11, 364271) If this is our religion, it is doomed.
('62', 188, 1, 12, 364310) Where there is so much hatred, so much antipathy, its doom is inevitable.
('62', 188, 1, 13, 364384) If we say that this has the sanction of the Shastras and call this Hindu religion, I shall say that it is completely at variance with universal experience and it cannot last long.
('62', 188, 1, 14, 364564) We may deceive ourselves, we may deceive others, too, but we cannot deceive God.
('62', 188, 1, 15, 364645) In my concept of Hindu religion, as I have learnt it through experience and after deep study, there is no place at all for the present form of untouchability; and therefore I have taken the vow that even at the cost of my life, untouchability must go root and branch.
('62', 188, 1, 16, 364913) Every single breath of mine all the twenty four hours seems to say Remove untouchability.
('62', 188, 1, 17, 365003) You can serve Harijans only by becoming their servants.
('62', 188, 1, 18, 365059) We have to become not the masters of Harijans, but their servants.
('62', 188, 1, 19, 365126) I did not ask you to sit and dine with them; although as is my wont I accept from anywhere the type of food I allow myself if it is cooked clean by anybody.
('62', 188, 1, 20, 365283) But I must tell you it was wrong to have sent away the Harijans in this contemptuous manner.
('62', 188, 1, 21, 365376) Kabir as well as other saints also have said that God lives with him who is forsaken by the world.
('62', 188, 1, 22, 365475) Whom the world shuns God accepts.
('62', 188, 1, 23, 365509) Such instances are to be found in all religions.
('62', 188, 1, 24, 365558) I remember a story of the days of Hazrat Omer.
('62', 188, 1, 25, 365605) When one of his commanders sent him 5,000 gold coins he started weeping at the sight.
('62', 188, 1, 26, 365691) When his wife asked him why he was weeping, he replied, Till today God was with me; today the world has come to me. So, you have disowned our Harijan brothers, but God is in truth with them alone.
('62', 188, 1, 27, 365888) Therefore you must remove the feeling of abhorrence that has crept into your hearts.
('62', 188, 1, 28, 365973) I have heard many people say, As one sows in the previous birth, so one reaps in this birth. But it is not right to say so; it is adharma.
('62', 188, 1, 29, 366112) There is pride in this statement.
('62', 188, 1, 30, 366146) When our parents or wife or children are in trouble, do we say that is the fruit of their doings in a previous birth and neglect them ?
('62', 188, 1, 31, 366282) We then look after them and serve
('62', 189, 0, 1, 366316) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 190
('62', 189, 1, 2, 366358) Then why this indifference towards others ?
('62', 189, 1, 3, 366402) I also believe in re birth but it cannot be interpreted in this manner.
('62', 189, 1, 4, 366474) This argument we can apply to ourselves only.
('62', 189, 1, 5, 366520) To ignore others on finding them in trouble and to laugh at themand to tell them to pay for the sins of their previous birth is to turn God, whom we call the Ocean of mercy and justice, into a demon.
('62', 189, 1, 6, 366720) I do not believe in such previous births.
('62', 189, 1, 7, 366762) Therefore, I beg you to think deeply over what I have said and, if you are convinced, give up this hatred and contempt and this feeling of high and low.
('62', 189, 1, 8, 366915) If you are yourself convinced that this is the right thing to do but you are afraid of the public, well, the public is here [with you].
('62', 189, 1, 9, 367051) The truth is that the fear is in your own heart.
('62', 189, 1, 10, 367100) If you give up this fear and hatred, the blot of untouchability will be removed from the Hindu religion and it will be for the good of us all.
('62', 189, 1, 11, 367243) Wherever I go, you give me money.
('62', 189, 1, 12, 367277) Even to give money is to help in the work for Harijans but please do not if you have Rs. 10 throw away a couple of rupees thinking that this is one way among others of spending your money.
('62', 189, 1, 13, 367466) No, even if you give one pice, give it whole heartedly, give it with love denying yourself some necessities.
('62', 189, 1, 14, 367575) He who gives a pice in this spirit will recover a thousandfold.
('62', 189, 1, 15, 367639) Therefore considering it a sacred cause, please help it as much as you can.

('62', 190, 8, 10, 368013) November 18, 1933
('62', 190, 9, 11, 368031) [The Swami] said that he wanted Gandhiji to give up his tour or give up talking
('62', 190, 10, 12, 368111) about the Bills and that, therefore, he was offering satyagraha and paying Gandhiji in
('62', 190, 11, 13, 368198) his own coin.
('62', 190, 12, 14, 368212) But this is not satyagraha but the negation of it.
('62', 190, 12, 15, 368263) You want me either to get you arrested by the police or to take the car over your bodies.
('62', 190, 12, 16, 368353) I would do neither.
('62', 190, 12, 17, 368373) I would go on foot.Then perhaps you would hold my feet and make me your prisoner.
('62', 190, 13, 18, 368455) Yes, we would hold your feet and implore you to stop this tour.
('62', 190, 14, 19, 368519) That would surely be violence.
('62', 190, 15, 20, 368550) I cannot hide our intention from you.
('62', 190, 15, 21, 368588) We want to be hurt by the police or by
('62', 190, 16, 22, 368627) your volunteers.
('62', 190, 16, 23, 368644) When this happens I know that you would give up the tour.
('62', 190, 17, 24, 368702) But I have told you that I shall certainly not summon the police

('62', 191, 1, 2, 369168) and I shall not let the volunteers hurt you.
('62', 191, 2, 3, 369213) We must then continue to obstuct your passage.
('62', 191, 3, 4, 369260) You are very unreasonable.
('62', 191, 3, 5, 369287) A satyagrahi must not be unre asonable.
('62', 191, 3, 6, 369327) You want to provoke the public to violence.
('62', 191, 3, 7, 369371) A satyagrahi never tempts anyone to do wrong.
('62', 191, 3, 8, 369417) And how can you resort to such unbecoming behaviour, especially in religious matters ?
('62', 191, 3, 9, 369504) No earthly power can force me to act contrary to me convictions.
('62', 191, 4, 10, 369569) Then you should show us the better way.
('62', 191, 5, 11, 369609) I can ertainly do that.
('62', 191, 5, 12, 369633) You should go back to Benares and ask the Lord of the Universe to wean me from my error.
('62', 191, 5, 13, 369722) You should fast as I did.
('62', 191, 6, 14, 369748) That we have not the ability to do.
('62', 191, 7, 15, 369784) Then I am very sorry.
('62', 191, 7, 16, 369806) I do not like this unseemly business.
('62', 191, 7, 17, 369844) You should go to your advisers and tell them to persuade me by argument or prayer.
('62', 191, 7, 18, 369927) If they cannot do so, they should tolerate what I am doing, even as I tolerate their opposition.
('62', 191, 7, 19, 370024) You can see that I am simply putting the case against the evil before the thousands who come to listen to me.

('62', 192, 1, 2, 370230) 207. SPEECH AT AKOLA
('62', 192, 2, 3, 370251) November 18, 1933 Before I come to our main subject today it is necessary to say something about the incident which took place while I was on my way here.
('62', 192, 2, 4, 370406) Some persons who have come from Kashi are accompanying me.
('62', 192, 2, 5, 370465) Amongst them is a Swami.They have a right to go with me in this way.
('62', 192, 2, 6, 370534) My tour is continuing at such a rapid pace that they cannot follow me everywhere, they come where they can and lie down on the road in front of the car in which I travel.Volunteers remove them and the car continues its journey.
('62', 192, 2, 7, 370762) The gentlemen do not abuse anyone; they do not indulge in violence.
('62', 192, 2, 8, 370830) And, I trust, the volunteers do not beat them either.
('62', 192, 2, 9, 370884) Today, too, they came to the gate.
('62', 192, 2, 10, 370919) This pained me.
('62', 192, 2, 11, 370935) I have always been pained at the absence of civility in those who come in the name of sanatan dharma.
('62', 192, 2, 12, 371037) I did not like to continue my journey after having them removed.
('62', 192, 2, 13, 371102) Hence, I sent for the Swami who is their leader and tried to reason with him.
('62', 192, 2, 14, 371180) 1 It is because of this that I am late.
('62', 192, 2, 15, 371220) I told him that it was not proper for those who claimed to safeguard religion to act in this manner.
('62', 192, 2, 16, 371321) As the author of the modern technique of satyagraha I told him that their action did not amount to satyagraha, that this kind of action would tire them.
('62', 192, 2, 17, 371474) If they caught hold of me, beat me up or abused me, I would not answer with obscene language, but would tolerate all that with a feeling of love.
('62', 192, 2, 18, 371620) I would continue on foot, if they obstructed my car from going further.
('62', 192, 2, 19, 371692) The Swami then replied that in that case they would cling to my feet and that I would have to walk over them.
('62', 192, 2, 20, 371802) I replied that I would not do so; nor would I seek the assistance of the police.
('62', 192, 2, 21, 371883) That would not do me credit.
('62', 192, 2, 22, 371912) I would seek their help if I was afraid, but I have no fear whatever.
('62', 192, 2, 23, 371982) In my life, I have been beaten up, but I never asked for police protection.
('62', 192, 2, 24, 372058) Would I then stoop to do so in the evening of my life while working for dharma?
('62', 192, 2, 25, 372138) Hence, I requested them to give me the way.
('62', 192, 2, 26, 372182) I told them that they ought to have realized that in sanatan dharma, in Hinduism, there is freedom to express all kinds of opinions.
('62', 192, 2, 27, 372315) Finally the Swami went out and returned after consulting his colleagues and said that if, today, I took another route they would not obstruct me again, and their prestige too would be saved.
('62', 192, 2, 28, 372506) I agreed to it and took another route.
('62', 192, 3, 29, 372545) 1 Vide the preceding item.
('62', 193, 0, 1, 372572) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 194
('62', 193, 1, 2, 372614) The persons accompanying the Swami are young men full of enthusiasm.
('62', 193, 1, 3, 372683) Someone has put the false notion into their heads that I am out to destroy sanatan dharma.
('62', 193, 1, 4, 372774) They believe that what I say is contrary to the Shastras.
('62', 193, 1, 5, 372832) They have a right to believe this.
('62', 193, 1, 6, 372867) If I am mistaken, they should strive hard to convince me.
('62', 193, 1, 7, 372925) That is the way of Hinduism, and it is a civilized way.
('62', 193, 1, 8, 372981) But I am not happy because sanatan dharma is degraded by their uncivilized conduct.
('62', 193, 1, 9, 373065) Hence I would humbly like to say to those who were opposing me in the name of sanatan dharma that they would be able to put a stop to my activities by appealing to my reason, by touching my heart and not through coercion or uncivilized conduct.
('62', 193, 1, 10, 373310) I am one bound by a pledge.
('62', 193, 1, 11, 373338) It is my dharma to abide by the pledge I have taken in the evening of my life.
('62', 193, 1, 12, 373417) To you who come here to listen to me I pour out my heart.
('62', 193, 1, 13, 373475) It is in your hands whether or not to act in accordance with what I say.
('62', 193, 1, 14, 373548) God will know whether you put it into action or not; I shall not be here to find it out.
('62', 193, 1, 15, 373637) This morning, some persons who were protesting stood in my way with black flags.
('62', 193, 1, 16, 373718) My dharma is not to be annoyed with them but to have a feeling of love towards them.
('62', 193, 1, 17, 373803) They may greet me with black flags if they believe that what I am doing is improper.
('62', 193, 1, 18, 373888) A servant of Harijans should be indifferent to praise or blame.
('62', 193, 1, 19, 373952) This rule applies not only to me but to people all over the world who are engaged in public life.
('62', 193, 1, 20, 374050) Anyone who does not follow it is sure to feel miserable.
('62', 193, 1, 21, 374107) Why should I feel miserable at this ?
('62', 193, 1, 22, 374145) What difference does it make to me whether they wave black flags at me or white ?
('62', 193, 1, 23, 374227) My work alone will bring me praise or blame.
('62', 193, 1, 24, 374272) I learn that today the sanatanists burned my effigy.
('62', 193, 1, 25, 374325) What does it matter to me even if crores of my effigies are burnt ?
('62', 193, 1, 26, 374393) It makes me unhappy because it involves some waste of money.
('62', 193, 1, 27, 374454) But I stand to lose nothing on that account.
('62', 193, 1, 28, 374499) If the people do not approve of what I say, if they disregard it, I can exert no pressure upon them.
('62', 193, 1, 29, 374600) I can hardly force them to listen to me against their will.
('62', 193, 1, 30, 374660) That is not my way of action; mine is a straight forward path.
('62', 193, 1, 31, 374723) Even if the Government did not let them burn it, 1 those who wished to do so have as good as accomplished it.
('62', 193, 1, 32, 374833) If I look at a woman with a lustful eye, I have as much as sinned against her.
('62', 193, 1, 33, 374912) God is hardly going to forgive me because I could not accomplish my evil desire !
('62', 193, 1, 34, 374994) He will argue that it
('62', 193, 2, 35, 375016) 1 Someone in the gathering said that the magistrate had not allowed the burning of the effigy.
('62', 194, 0, 1, 375111) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 195
('62', 194, 1, 2, 375158) was He who prevented the sinful act; I on my part had already committed it.
('62', 194, 1, 3, 375234) Likewise, does it matter if the gentlemen could not actually burn the effigy ?
('62', 194, 1, 4, 375313) So far as they are concerned, they have as good as burnt it.
('62', 194, 1, 5, 375374) Anyway it is all right if they burned it.
('62', 194, 1, 6, 375416) Despite this, for the sake of dharma, I do wish they had not done so.
('62', 194, 1, 7, 375486) The sanatanists have brought out a leaflet alleging they were beaten up by the volunteers.
('62', 194, 1, 8, 375577) If it is true, it was wrong on the part of the latter to have done so.
('62', 194, 1, 9, 375648) I will not tolerate it.
('62', 194, 1, 10, 375672) I do not approve of anyone wishing to protect me indulging in abusive language, rudeness or physical violence.
('62', 194, 1, 11, 375783) Biyaniji 1 says the volunteers did nothing of the kind.
('62', 194, 1, 12, 375839) I wish only to warn the volunteers.
('62', 194, 1, 13, 375875) Perhaps my sanatanist brothers are irked by the large audiences at my meetings.
('62', 194, 1, 14, 375955) Perhaps they may try to prevent the people from attending.
('62', 194, 1, 15, 376014) They have every right to do so.
('62', 194, 1, 16, 376046) Let no one obstruct the sanatanists, but we should try to persuade them politely.
('62', 194, 1, 17, 376128) If they are not convinced, let them do as they wish.
('62', 194, 1, 18, 376181) No one should inform the police.
('62', 194, 1, 19, 376214) Let no one do anything to protect me.
('62', 194, 1, 20, 376252) God has saved me in similar circumstances a number of times.
('62', 194, 1, 21, 376313) So long as God wishes to take work from me He will keep my body healthy and safe.
('62', 194, 1, 22, 376395) When my lifespan has ended, no power on earth can keep me alive.
('62', 194, 1, 23, 376460) Entertain no doubt that the current movement is a test for Hindu society.
('62', 194, 1, 24, 376534) The whole world is watching whether Hinduism rids itself of the evil of untouchability.
('62', 194, 1, 25, 376622) If untouchability is wiped out of the hearts of Hindus, a feeling of brotherhood would come to be established between Hindus, Muslims, Christians and Jews.
('62', 194, 1, 26, 376778) Untouchability has spread its innumerable tentacles far and wide.
('62', 194, 1, 27, 376844) It has spread even to those whom we regard as belonging to other faiths.
('62', 194, 1, 28, 376917) I do not regard this as dharma.
('62', 194, 1, 29, 376949) Hatred or contempt has no place in Hinduism.
('62', 194, 1, 30, 376994) Many shastris have informed me that there is no sign in the law books of untouchability as practised today.
('62', 194, 1, 31, 377102) However, even if it is there, we shall have to reject it; otherwise we shall have to give up the claim that Hinduism is basically a nonviolent and tolerant faith.
('62', 194, 1, 32, 377265) This movement of ours is being carried on before the eyes of the world, not in seclusion.
('62', 194, 1, 33, 377355) It is your duty as well as mine to do whatever we do, in a civilized, truthful, peaceful and courteous manner.
('62', 194, 1, 34, 377466) I request the sanatanists, too, to carry out their task in a similar manner.
('62', 194, 1, 35, 377543) I find no civility in the attempt to stop me car.
('62', 194, 1, 36, 377593) They had better give up black flags and the burning of effigies.

('62', 195, 0, 1, 377711) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 196
('62', 195, 1, 2, 377753) mark of protest.
('62', 195, 1, 3, 377770) When the satyagraha movement was on, black flags were sometimes used to express protest, but I had not approved of it.
('62', 195, 1, 4, 377889) It is not a civilized practice.
('62', 195, 1, 5, 377921) It bears no mark of satyagraha.
('62', 195, 1, 6, 377953) A satyagrahis dharma is to win over through friendship the heart of anyone who has become an enemy and bring about a change of heart in him.
('62', 195, 1, 7, 378094) The rules of satyagraha do not vary when applied to dealings between one Hindu and another, between Hindus and Muslims or, between Indians and the British.
('62', 195, 1, 8, 378250) The rules of satyagraha are equally applicable to all.
('62', 195, 1, 9, 378305) There can be no room in it for breach of the peace, lack of civility, violence or hatred.
('62', 195, 1, 10, 378395) Hinduism would come out trium phant if both the sanatanists and reformist Hindus acted in accordance with it, regardless of whether untouchability remains or not.
('62', 195, 1, 11, 378558) Hinduism cannot survive if untouchability continues.
('62', 195, 1, 12, 378611) However, it would be welcome if both the parties kept to the path of truth.
('62', 195, 1, 13, 378687) This is a tre mendous movement in which twenty two crores of Hindus are being tested.
('62', 195, 1, 14, 378773) It is also a test for Harijans.
('62', 195, 1, 15, 378805) It is the caste Hindus who have sinned, hence, it is they who have to atone for it.
('62', 195, 1, 16, 378889) Since Harijans are also Hindus, I say that it is a test for them too.
('62', 195, 1, 17, 378959) It is worth knowing what these ten or twelve people who have come from Kashi want.
('62', 195, 1, 18, 379042) They say that I am free to continue the work of abolishing untouchability, I may carry on the work of temple entry, but that I should not plead with the people in favour of the Bills on these two subjects which are before the Central Legislature, that I should not endeavour to get them passed.
('62', 195, 1, 19, 379337) Others too claim that legislation will mean interference with religion.
('62', 195, 1, 20, 379409) For the last two or three days I have been hearing such echoes.
('62', 195, 1, 21, 379473) I have answered them to the best of my ability.
('62', 195, 1, 22, 379521) We are bound by a pledge.
('62', 195, 1, 23, 379547) Last year in Sep tember, representatives of the Hindus took a pledge under the chairmanship of Malaviyaji Maharaj in Bombay.
('62', 195, 1, 24, 379672) I had drafted the original form of the pledge.
('62', 195, 1, 25, 379719) The resolution which was passed was almost identical with the one proposed by me.
('62', 195, 1, 26, 379801) I had given my word to Dr. Ambedkar and to Rao Bahadur Rajah that I was offering my life as hostage to see it that the Hindu society abides by the pledge.
('62', 195, 1, 27, 379956) Hence it is my duty to persuade caste Hindus to do so .
('62', 195, 1, 28, 380012) Both temple entry and enabling legislation are part of the pledge.
('62', 195, 1, 29, 380079) The Templeentry Bill is harmless.
('62', 195, 1, 30, 380113) Moreover, they are hardly likely to be passed because I want it.
('62', 195, 1, 31, 380178) If it were so, they would have been passed long ago.
('62', 195, 1, 32, 380231) One of the Bills has been published for [eliciting] public opinion.
('62', 195, 1, 33, 380299) It is your dharma as well as mine to work for its passage.
('62', 195, 1, 34, 380358) It puts an end to the legal obstacle.
('62', 195, 1, 35, 380396) Those temples which, under certain circumstances,
('62', 196, 0, 1, 380446) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 197
('62', 196, 1, 2, 380493) could not, till this day, open their doors to Harijans will be permitted to do so.
('62', 196, 1, 3, 380576) Today, it seems, although many people may be in favour of throwing open the temple doors, a single person can prevent it.
('62', 196, 1, 4, 380698) This Bill seeks to remove the obstacle.
('62', 196, 1, 5, 380738) There is no coercion.
('62', 196, 1, 6, 380760) Those who believe that the image loses its sanctity by Harijans entering the temple may stop going there.
('62', 196, 1, 7, 380866) But the majority are of the opinion that God does not come to dwell in the image until the Harijans are admitted.
('62', 196, 1, 8, 380980) What should those who believe this do ?
('62', 196, 1, 9, 381020) If they did not have the legal obstruction removed, their pledge would be broken.
('62', 196, 1, 10, 381102) The Bill harms no one.
('62', 196, 1, 11, 381125) It has not the remotest suggestion of coercion.
('62', 196, 1, 12, 381173) The second Bill does not affect religious untouchability.
('62', 196, 1, 13, 381231) It only says that untouchability has no place in law, in lawcourts.
('62', 196, 1, 14, 381299) On the one hand, we want the law not to interfere with religion and, on the other, we seek to perpetuate untouchability through the civil code.
('62', 196, 1, 15, 381443) How could it be ?
('62', 196, 1, 16, 381461) Lawyers point out that today untouchability is sanctioned by law.
('62', 196, 1, 17, 381527) It will be eradicated by having these two Bills passed ; for that caste Hindus will have to undergo a change of heart.
('62', 196, 1, 18, 381646) The Bills seek to protect those who disregard untouchability as well as the untouchables who enjoy no such protection today.
('62', 196, 1, 19, 381771) If we did not willingly abolish untouchability today, we shall have to give it up under compulsion in the future.
('62', 196, 1, 20, 381885) We did not willingly let Harijans occupy the railway compartments ; today they sit there in spite of us.
('62', 196, 1, 21, 381990) Overwhelmed by selfish motives, we employ them in the mills.
('62', 196, 1, 22, 382051) There is no merit in doing an act grudgingly.
('62', 196, 1, 23, 382097) At present, we are perched on their shoulders, we ought to get off.
('62', 196, 1, 24, 382165) I ask you to contribute money in order to bring them justice.
('62', 196, 1, 25, 382227) You and I would not want to live in the homes where Harijans live.
('62', 196, 1, 26, 382294) They do not observe rules of sanitation, as they do not have the necessary facilities.
('62', 196, 1, 27, 382381) They are illiterate.
('62', 196, 1, 28, 382402) The task of removing their hardships cannot be accomplished without funds, hence I ask you for funds.
('62', 196, 1, 29, 382504) Please do not contribute grudgingly.
('62', 196, 1, 30, 382541) This is not like throwing away money on idle entertainment.
('62', 196, 1, 31, 382601) This is an act of sacrifice, of dedication.
('62', 196, 1, 32, 382645) If you contribute in the spirit of sacrifice, I shall be convinced that you have made a significant contribution.
('62', 196, 1, 33, 382759) Even a cowrie given in a a charitable spirit will suffice, whereas a rupee parted with in a niggardly spirit has no value.
('62', 196, 1, 34, 382882) The service of Harijans is after all the service of God.
('62', 196, 1, 35, 382939) But God gets His work done through man.
('62', 196, 1, 36, 382979) He gets His work done by one who feels His presence and fears Him.
('62', 196, 1, 37, 383046) Your money by itself is not going to be enough for Harijans.
('62', 196, 1, 38, 383107) Your real contribution is your sympathy for this cause.
('62', 196, 1, 39, 383163) In the morning, Shrimati Durgatai placed her gold bangles, silver mug and tumbler before me and said that she had preserved with care these things which were dear to her ;
('62', 197, 0, 1, 383335) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 198
('62', 197, 1, 2, 383377) and that today she was giving them away for the service of Harijans.
('62', 197, 1, 3, 383446) I ask all men and women to make such a sacrifice.

('62', 197, 3, 6, 383568) [November 19, 1933] 1
('62', 197, 4, 7, 383590) BHAI GORDHANBHAI, Manibehn writes to me saying that you were grieved at my absence in Bombay at the time of the funeral.
('62', 197, 4, 8, 383711) In a way I am happy about it.
('62', 197, 4, 9, 383741) Your grief suggests that you regard me as a member of the family.
('62', 197, 4, 10, 383807) You have a right to regard me as such.
('62', 197, 4, 11, 383846) But if you regard me as one of the family you should ask me when you fail to understand my action.
('62', 197, 4, 12, 383945) My differences with Vithalbhai had absolutely nothing to do with my not going there.
('62', 197, 4, 13, 384030) My present circumstances were the sole reason behind my not going over.
('62', 197, 4, 14, 384102) I am out of jail solely for Harijan work.
('62', 197, 4, 15, 384144) The programme had already been fixed.
('62', 197, 4, 16, 384182) I would not be willing to submit myself to such Government restrictions as do not deserve to be endured.
('62', 197, 4, 17, 384287) Besides, I could not see myself likely to be useful in any other way.
('62', 197, 4, 18, 384357) Again, my view of death as also my attitude towards funeral rites were likely to render me of no use whatever.
('62', 197, 4, 19, 384468) Therefore, looking at it from any point of view, my attendance was not necessary, nay, it would have been improper.
('62', 197, 4, 20, 384584) Why, I would not have permitted part of what happened.
('62', 197, 4, 21, 384639) For me it should suffice to let you know that my differences with Vithalbhai were not in the least instrumental [in my decision].
('62', 197, 4, 22, 384769) You may not be aware that on receiving news of his illness I had written to him to which he had promptly sent a long and sweet reply.
('62', 197, 4, 23, 384903) When his illness had aggravated, I had also wired to him, to which again he had replied.
('62', 197, 4, 24, 384992) He also asked you to keep me informed about his health.
('62', 197, 4, 25, 385048) Mistaking your wire to have been from Gordhanbhai, the Secretary of the Millowners Association, I sent a letter of thanks to the latter.
('62', 197, 4, 26, 385185) He wrote to me that the wire was not from him.
('62', 197, 4, 27, 385232) I hope this explanation would pacify you.
('62', 197, 4, 28, 385274) If not, please do ask me again.

('62', 198, 2, 3, 385483) (CHIKHALDA), November 19, 1933
('62', 198, 3, 4, 385514) MANI, You are doing well to give expression to all that you and other relatives feel.
('62', 198, 3, 5, 385600) I could not bear either Dahyabhai or Gordhanbhai mis understanding me.
('62', 198, 3, 6, 385671) If you are in Bombay, I think you will read my letter 1 to Gordhanbhai.
('62', 198, 3, 7, 385743) If you wish to say anything after reading it, you may do so.
('62', 198, 3, 8, 385804) You must have got my letter.
('62', 198, 3, 9, 385833) I see no need for me to write to the Press.
('62', 198, 3, 10, 385877) I dont think it always necessary to reply every time I find newspapers misunderstand my actions or deliberately misrepresent them.
('62', 198, 3, 11, 386008) If, however, you two, brother and sister, so desire, I will certainly do it.
('62', 198, 3, 12, 386085) My position is quite clear.
('62', 198, 3, 13, 386113) There is considerable truth in what Dahyabhai says.
('62', 198, 3, 14, 386165) We can certainly point out blemishes in [ C.R. ] Das and others.
('62', 198, 3, 15, 386230) Is there anybody who is blameless ?
('62', 198, 3, 16, 386266) But my not going there has nothing to do with Vithalbhais shortcomings.
('62', 198, 3, 17, 386338) He certainly deserved the same honour that the other leaders got.
('62', 198, 3, 18, 386404) His selfsacrifice, determination, ability and his loyalty to the Congress were in no way inferior to those of the others.
('62', 198, 3, 19, 386526) Your own generosity fills me with admiration.
('62', 198, 3, 20, 386572) But mind you, it is not peculiar to you.
('62', 198, 3, 21, 386613) I have seen such generosity in countless women.
('62', 198, 3, 22, 386661) They are always ready to forget the wrongs done to them.
('62', 198, 3, 23, 386718) It is this virtue which is their special honour.
('62', 198, 3, 24, 386767) But men have taken undue advantage of it.
('62', 198, 3, 25, 386809) But that is a different story.
('62', 198, 3, 26, 386840) May I take credit for your behaving so admirably in my eyes just now ?
('62', 198, 3, 27, 386911) Write to Wardha.

('62', 199, 9, 15, 387556) On reading it I have come to the conclusion that you should now withdraw yourself from the struggle.
('62', 199, 9, 16, 387657) This struggle will go on for many years.
('62', 199, 9, 17, 387698) After you have paid all your debts and the burden of earning a livelihood becomes somewhat lighter you can join the struggle.
('62', 199, 9, 18, 387824) Many people who would have wanted to take part in the struggle have, for similar reasons, withdrawn themselves from the scene.
('62', 199, 9, 19, 387951) Those who plunge into the fight have to give up attachment to the family.
('62', 199, 9, 20, 388025) Our family system is in need of much reform.
('62', 199, 9, 21, 388070) But this is a separate question.
('62', 199, 9, 22, 388103) You might consult Jawaharlal.
('62', 199, 9, 23, 388133) I have restrained many people like you.
('62', 199, 9, 24, 388173) If you feel Prabhavati also should be restrained you may do so.
('62', 199, 9, 25, 388237) If you consider it necessary you may see me about this.

('62', 200, 2, 3, 388556) Unrevised AS AT WARDHA,
('62', 200, 3, 4, 388580) November 20, 1933
('62', 200, 4, 5, 388598) MY DEAR KISAN, Have mercy on a poor old man.
('62', 200, 4, 6, 388643) Why do you doubt me when I say I never was angry with you ?
('62', 200, 4, 7, 388703) Did you give me any cause for anger ?
('62', 200, 4, 8, 388741) Even now I do not know anything against you that would make me angry.
('62', 200, 4, 9, 388811) It is but natural for young people not to understand old peo ple.
('62', 200, 4, 10, 388877) How should you understand what it is to be without teeth or muscle, or know at 20 what you would yourself feel when you are four times twenty?
('62', 200, 4, 11, 389020) Old men are not too deep for young people to understand.
('62', 200, 4, 12, 389077) They may be imbecile.
('62', 200, 4, 13, 389099) Whatever your own experience in other cases, it is inapplicable in my case.
('62', 200, 4, 14, 389175) How nice it would have been if you would have joined me at Wardha.
('62', 200, 4, 15, 389242) I would love to have you even now.
('62', 200, 4, 16, 389277) But can you stand the very heavy strain of the tour?
('62', 200, 4, 17, 389330) Are you strong enough in body and mind to be able to go through the eternal rush?
('62', 200, 4, 18, 389412) 1 What does Dhuran dhar say ?
('62', 200, 4, 19, 389442) I do receive news about Prema through the visitors who visit her companions.
('62', 200, 4, 20, 389519) But you should continue to tell me all you come to know about her.

('62', 201, 1, 2, 390006) [Government] is correct up to a point.
('62', 201, 1, 3, 390045) But the reason behind this [difference] is that the States on their part are enslaved.
('62', 201, 1, 4, 390132) The masters shortcomings are always found doubled in the case of his slaves.
('62', 201, 1, 5, 390209) Hence what you experienced is due to the influence of the British Government.
('62', 201, 1, 6, 390287) This does not mean that the States were any better before.
('62', 201, 1, 7, 390346) But formerly their faults used to be removed jointly by the ruler and his subjects.
('62', 201, 1, 8, 390430) Today such a phenomenon is well nigh im possible, because there is rot at the root.
('62', 201, 1, 9, 390514) The introduction of machines will certainly bring about an improvement in the economic condition of a few.
('62', 201, 1, 10, 390621) Machines would not provide employment to thirty crores of people.
('62', 201, 1, 11, 390687) They ought to get some additional work besides agriculture.
('62', 201, 1, 12, 390747) And it cannot be anything but spinning.
('62', 201, 1, 13, 390787) It would therefore be better if you start using khadi in your house.
('62', 201, 1, 14, 390856) It is the experience of many that one can afford khadi if one restrains ones fondness for clothes.
('62', 201, 1, 15, 390955) If all of you spin for some time daily and have the yarn woven, you will find khadi quite inex pensive.
('62', 201, 1, 16, 391059) Also, Purushottam, Jamnadas, etc., can help you in this regard.
('62', 201, 1, 17, 391123) Ramdas is at Wardha.
('62', 201, 1, 18, 391144) Keshu, Krishno are also there.
('62', 201, 1, 19, 391175) Manu has gone to Rajkot because Kusum is ill.
('62', 201, 1, 20, 391221) May be you know it.

('62', 201, 1, 22, 391267) My health continues to be good.
('62', 201, 1, 23, 391299) If you do not read the Harijanbandhu, start reading it now.

('62', 202, 3, 4, 391829) BHAI KOTWAL, The work which has come to us unsought is swadharma.
('62', 202, 3, 5, 391895) Anybody who is wedded to an institution should not, as a general rule, join the present battle.
('62', 202, 3, 6, 391991) Ones dharma cannot be pointed out to one by somebody else.
('62', 202, 3, 7, 392050) He who has seen it adheres to it despite the opposition of the whole world.
('62', 202, 3, 8, 392126) We should not sit in judgment over anybody.
('62', 202, 3, 9, 392170) Every case should ultimately be judged on its own merits.
('62', 202, 3, 10, 392228) It is therefore dangerous to be guided by solutions of hypothetical cases.

('62', 202, 9, 15, 392405) BHAI VAMANRAO, I have been able to take up your letter only today.
('62', 202, 9, 16, 392472) What little I have read about Shivaji was as a student at school.
('62', 202, 9, 17, 392538) It is shameful but true.
('62', 202, 9, 18, 392563) Afterwards I learnt about him more from the elders.
('62', 202, 9, 19, 392615) But when I realized that British historians, particularly those belonging to the official community, could not see things from our point of view even if they wanted to, I adopted a yardstick: Without reading up any other material I concluded that just the opposite of whatever I had read must be true and I started believing that Shivaji was really a great king, brave and patriotic.
('62', 202, 9, 20, 392999) These qualities were more than enough to arouse my feeling of reverence for him.
('62', 202, 9, 21, 393080) To expect more from me at this time is to be like a cruel milkman who extracts the last drop of milk from the cow till she starts bleeding.

('62', 203, 3, 8, 393487) Dont be disheartened.
('62', 203, 3, 9, 393509) Know that there is virtue in eating what one has cooked with ones own hands.

('62', 204, 1, 2, 394282) 219. SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, MORSI
('62', 204, 2, 3, 394319) November 21, 1933 These differences 1 are verily offshoots of the curse of untou chability, for they proceed from a sense of superiority and inferiority.
('62', 204, 2, 4, 394473) The fourfold division of varna is based on duty and not on right.
('62', 204, 2, 5, 394539) Dharma does not confer rights but lays down obligations.
('62', 204, 2, 6, 394596) Where all perform the duties that have fallen to their lot, no one is higher than the others.
('62', 204, 2, 7, 394690) Once we are able to purge ourselves of untouchability, and with it the spirit of high and low, we shall realize the unity underlying all races and religions.
('62', 204, 2, 8, 394848) In spite of the differences of races and reli gions, we shall learn to tolerate and respect one another and consider all human beings as children of one God and, therefore, brothers and sisters of one another.
('62', 204, 2, 9, 395058) God is the Creator of all life; all his creatures are, therefore, equal in His eyes.
('62', 204, 2, 10, 395143) Humanity is a gigantic tree having innumerable branches and leaves, and the same life throbs through them all.
('62', 204, 2, 11, 395254) The realization of unity in diversity is implied in the removal of untouchability.

('62', 204, 5, 16, 395489) It was not right for you to have tried to climb the hill.
('62', 204, 5, 17, 395547) You can not get strength so soon.
('62', 204, 5, 18, 395581) Be careful for some time yet about food and going out.
('62', 204, 5, 19, 395636) I have not been able to reply to.
('62', 204, 5, 20, 395670) s 2 son.
('62', 204, 5, 21, 395679) Letters are accumulating every day.
('62', 204, 5, 22, 395715) The programme of the tour has been so fixed that I get time to write letters only on the weekly silence day and between 3 and 4 a.m.
('62', 204, 5, 23, 395848) every day.

('62', 205, 1, 6, 396157) must, therefore, rely on his own efforts at present.
('62', 205, 1, 7, 396210) If I can rest peacefully any time in future, I may be able to do something for persons like him.
('62', 205, 1, 8, 396307) But I am not likely to enjoy such peace in my lifetime.
('62', 205, 1, 9, 396363) If you think you must write to him yourself, you may do so.
('62', 205, 1, 10, 396423) I dont know when my teeth will be examined.
('62', 205, 1, 11, 396467) I have been told that the condition of the teeth may be responsible for the pain in the elbow.
('62', 205, 1, 12, 396562) It is very unlikely to be so, for there is no other trouble.
('62', 205, 1, 13, 396623) The bloodpressure has disappeared completely, and the weight is going up.
('62', 205, 1, 14, 396697) I have already reached 109. I also had a letter from Soman 3 .

('62', 207, 5, 8, 399277) The attendance at public meetings held throughout the tour was the largest ever seen and it gives me cause to hope that untouchability is fast dying.

('62', 208, 3, 4, 400133) November 23, 1933
('62', 208, 4, 5, 400151) MY DEAR MAHADEV, On getting up at 3 a.m.
('62', 208, 4, 6, 400192) I found your letter to Mira lying on the little stool which is being carried from place to place as a footboard for me to stretch my legs on.
('62', 208, 4, 7, 400334) It took me nearly 40 minutes to go through it and yet without reading your comments on the translation of the verses specified.
('62', 208, 4, 8, 400462) 1 It would take me at least twelve hours to read up my translation [of] the original and think out what I should say.
('62', 208, 4, 9, 400580) It will take at least another three hours to reduce them to writing.
('62', 208, 4, 10, 400649) That time I cannot give just now.
('62', 208, 4, 11, 400683) Then there is the questionshall I help you much ?
('62', 208, 4, 12, 400733) I fear, not.
('62', 208, 4, 13, 400746) For what you say is quite true.
('62', 208, 4, 14, 400778) I ought not to have yielded to Swamis demand for my own translation except perhaps for private circulation among friends.
('62', 208, 4, 15, 400900) I realized my unfitness for the task as I was proceeding but I continued.
('62', 208, 4, 16, 400974) The defects you have noticed are there.
('62', 208, 4, 17, 401014) How can I give what I have notscholarship ?
('62', 208, 4, 18, 401058) Want of good knowledge of Sanskrit was a great drawback.
('62', 208, 4, 19, 401115) The remedy is clear.
('62', 208, 4, 20, 401136) You should go on with your translation taking such help as my translations can give to bring out my thought but not always following my translation.
('62', 208, 4, 21, 401285) Give that rendering which is acceptable to you.
('62', 208, 4, 22, 401333) Ignore the notes where they are useless.
('62', 208, 4, 23, 401374) Give your own where they are nece ssary.
('62', 208, 4, 24, 401415) Having done that, take up the Gujarati, correct the translation where it is defective and polish the language where it needs polishing.
('62', 208, 4, 25, 401551) Re write and add notes where necessary.
('62', 208, 4, 26, 401591) That will complete your task.
('62', 208, 4, 27, 401621) Then when the whole result comes into my hands, I shall work on it and make such changes as I may deem fit in order to bring out my meaning.
('62', 208, 4, 28, 401762) This I can do easily.
('62', 208, 4, 29, 401784) We must then bring out a revised version of the Gujarati and publish your translation in English.
('62', 208, 4, 30, 401882) 2 So doing, you do not need to stop your work for want of my detailed reply to your comments.
('62', 208, 4, 31, 401976) I shall circulate your comments among friends and get their opinion and let you have it all.
('62', 208, 4, 32, 402069) Your other messages will be attended to.

('62', 209, 1, 3, 402414) Only do not wash yourself out with mere literary work.
('62', 209, 1, 4, 402469) You should take plenty of exercise and keep the body in a fit condition.

('62', 209, 4, 10, 402680) RAIPUR, November 23, 1933
('62', 209, 5, 11, 402706) PRABHAVATI, I got your letter.
('62', 209, 5, 12, 402737) You have given two addresses.
('62', 209, 5, 13, 402767) In your previous letter you gave the Siwan address and in this one you have given the Sitabadiara address.
('62', 209, 5, 14, 402874) I am writing this letter at the latter address.
('62', 209, 5, 15, 402922) I have already written to you about Jayaprakash.
('62', 209, 5, 16, 402971) I addressed that letter at Siwan.
('62', 209, 5, 17, 403005) The present fight is not for people who have debts to pay and wish to discharge their responsibilities towards their brothers and sisters.
('62', 209, 5, 18, 403144) This fight requires one to sacrifice ones all.
('62', 209, 5, 19, 403191) How do a poor mans brothers and sisters get education ?
('62', 209, 5, 20, 403247) We should adopt such a way that our brothers and sisters grow up in poverty and get educated and start earning as soon as possible.
('62', 209, 5, 21, 403379) That leaves the problem of Father.
('62', 209, 5, 22, 403414) The fifty rupees which he gets should suffice.
('62', 209, 5, 23, 403461) Both of you should renounce your share in his property.
('62', 209, 5, 24, 403517) Jayaprakash can remain in the present fight only if he is thus prepared to embrace poverty.
('62', 209, 5, 25, 403609) This is a soldiers dharma.
('62', 209, 5, 26, 403636) The other dharma is towards ones family.
('62', 209, 5, 27, 403677) It also is worth following if one wishes to do so .
('62', 209, 5, 28, 403729) When it becomes an absolute dharma, it is in conflict with the good of society as a whole.
('62', 209, 5, 29, 403820) That is what we find among us today.
('62', 209, 5, 30, 403857) It is the aim of satyagraha to remedy this situation.
('62', 209, 5, 31, 403911) But anybody who does not understand satyagraha and still follows it fails in both dharmas for he will remain discontented.
('62', 209, 5, 32, 404034) If you do not understand anything in this, you may ask me to explain again.
('62', 209, 5, 33, 404110) But I dont think you will find any difficulty in understanding it.
('62', 209, 5, 34, 404177) I have already sent you the programme of my tour, and do not repeat it here.
('62', 209, 5, 35, 404254) There is nothing now which you should specially come

('62', 210, 6, 10, 404636) BHAI VALLABHBHAI, You really seem to have stopped writing to me.
('62', 210, 6, 11, 404701) It was necessary for Jamnalalji to resign even for his own peace of mind.
('62', 210, 6, 12, 404775) The resig nation was desirable from the point of view of its effect on others, too.
('62', 210, 6, 13, 404859) It has cleansed the atmosphere completely.
('62', 210, 6, 14, 404902) A load is off Jamnalaljis mind and he feels much stronger now.
('62', 210, 6, 15, 404965) I dont wish to write more.
('62', 210, 6, 16, 404992) Please however have no doubts about the propriety of the step.
('62', 210, 6, 17, 405055) I hear that there has been a small breakdown in your health.
('62', 210, 6, 18, 405116) Let me know if there has been any such thing.
('62', 210, 6, 19, 405162) If you can tell me your weight, do so.
('62', 210, 6, 20, 405201) Is there any trouble with your nose ?
('62', 210, 6, 21, 405239) I hope you wouldnt think it necessary to keep back anything from me.
('62', 210, 6, 22, 405308) Mahadev is being tested well.
('62', 210, 6, 23, 405338) I am glad about it.
('62', 210, 6, 24, 405358) There are diffi culties now regarding Gujarati letters.
('62', 210, 6, 25, 405414) I intend to write to the Colonel 1
('62', 210, 7, 26, 405449) in the matter, though I dont like to do even that.
('62', 210, 7, 27, 405500) I have had no letters from Devdas recently.
('62', 210, 7, 28, 405544) Khurshed is im proving.
('62', 210, 7, 29, 405568) She remained ill for a fairly long time.
('62', 210, 7, 30, 405609) I cant write more since it is time for the post.
('62', 210, 7, 31, 405658) I am going on well enough.
('62', 210, 7, 32, 405685) The crowds are as large as ever, perhaps larger than before.
('62', 210, 7, 33, 405746) And they are equally mad with love.

('62', 211, 2, 3, 405993) November 23, 1933 I have repeatedly said that this work can be done only by those who sincerely believe untouchability to be a stain on Hinduism.
('62', 211, 2, 4, 406139) This is a movement requiring the change of heart of millions.
('62', 211, 2, 5, 406201) It cannot be led to success by any political manoeuvres.
('62', 211, 2, 6, 406258) It can be done only through selfpurification.
('62', 211, 2, 7, 406304) This is a great sacrificial fire in which we have to burn our load of sins and come out purified.
('62', 211, 2, 8, 406402) Those who do not take to this work with faith and spirit will fail to move the hearts of millions.
('62', 211, 2, 9, 406501) We shall be nowhere if we deceive ourselves or the Harijans.
('62', 211, 2, 10, 406562) The success or failure of this movement depends on our getting the right type of workers.
('62', 211, 2, 11, 406652) We are on our trial today.
('62', 211, 2, 12, 406679) If we miss today the oppportunity that God has given us, we may never hope to get the opportunity again in this generation.
('62', 211, 2, 13, 406803) What we refuse to do voluntarily today we shall have to do in future per force, and we shall repent for having lost this opportunity.
('62', 211, 2, 14, 406937) I pray to God that we may come out suc cessful from this trial and save Hinduism and ourselves from des truction.

('62', 211, 5, 17, 407120) November 23, 1933 In a country where 95 per cent of the population live on the land, even if all the processes of cultivation were carried on through machines, there would still be need for a supplementary cottage industry.
('62', 211, 5, 18, 407344) The spinning wheel supplied that supplementary industry to the Indian peasant from time immemorial.
('62', 211, 5, 19, 407444) Many minor industries are nowadays suggested for the purpose, but none of them can be universalized as the production of khadi can be.
('62', 211, 5, 20, 407579) I consented to open this exhibition, for I know that thousands of Harijans get their living through khadi, which has saved them from destitution.
('62', 211, 5, 21, 407725) We may revive
('62', 211, 6, 22, 407739) 1 According to Chandrashankar Shuklas report, the speech was addressed to Harijan workers.
('62', 211, 6, 23, 407830) However, according to The Bombay Chronicle, 2911 1933, and Hitavada, 3121933, this was in reply to addresses presented by the Municipality, the Local Board and other institutions.

('62', 212, 4, 5, 408229) [Before November 24, 1933] 2
('62', 212, 5, 6, 408258) Injustice is being done all the world over, but we have given to it the sanction of religion.
('62', 212, 5, 7, 408352) These distinctions have not been created by God.
('62', 212, 5, 8, 408401) The Harijans are on the lowest rung of the ladder not because of any inherent defects but only because they have been kept down by the socalled higher castes.
('62', 212, 5, 9, 408560) God had bestowed on them the same talents that He had given us, but we deny them the opportunities for using them.
('62', 212, 5, 10, 408675) They should surely have the same rights and privileges and the same opportunities of growth that we enjoy.
('62', 212, 5, 11, 408782) We are now awake to the wrong we have done to them, and the least we can do by way of penance now is to contribute money for their uplift and to share with them all the amenities of life that we have created for ourselves.
('62', 212, 5, 12, 409005) We are all creatures of the same God and, therefore, equal in His eyes.
('62', 212, 6, 13, 409077) From the money that you give for this cause, you will reap a hundredfold, for it is like grain sown in good, manured soil.
('62', 212, 6, 14, 409200) The money spent after luxury and lust is, on the other hand, wasted like grain sown in barren soil.
('62', 212, 7, 15, 409300) I am told you have suffered heavily.
('62', 212, 7, 16, 409337) But you should know that no nation has ever come to its own without having passed through the severest fire of suffering.
('62', 212, 7, 17, 409459) Voluntary suffering only adds to our strength.
('62', 212, 7, 18, 409506) I, therefore, congratulate you for having suffered.
('62', 212, 7, 19, 409558) But I should also like to remind you that one of the causes that add to our sufferings is this curse of untouchability.
('62', 212, 7, 20, 409678) We have oppressed the weak.
('62', 212, 7, 21, 409706) We reap as we have sown.
('62', 212, 7, 22, 409731) It is for us now to undo the wrong we have done to the Harijans and remove the yoke of serfdom from their

('62', 213, 2, 3, 410085) Caste Hindus must first ask you to forgive the wrongs they have done to you.
('62', 213, 2, 4, 410162) But I should also tell you, as a Harijan by choice, that you should give up your evil habits, especially carrion and beef eating.
('62', 213, 2, 5, 410292) The whole world looks upon carrion with abhorrence.
('62', 213, 2, 6, 410344) And beefeating should be given up because that is a sine qua non for a Hindu.
('62', 213, 2, 7, 410422) The cow is the giver of plenty, and by killing her we kill ourselves.
('62', 213, 2, 8, 410492) Then, I would urge you not to accept leavings.
('62', 213, 2, 9, 410539) And, above all, you should abolish the distinctions of high and low that have crept in among yourselves.
('62', 213, 2, 10, 410644) And these things you should do, not in a bargaining spirit but because they are good in themselves.
('62', 213, 2, 11, 410744) I would, therefore, ask you also to give up drink, irrespective of the fact that many other Hindus drink.

('62', 213, 3, 13, 410867) 232. CIVIL RESISTANCE AND HARIJAN SERVICE A friend writes : 2
('62', 213, 4, 14, 410929) I observe that there are some people in the Harijan service organizations not working in the spirit in which you want them to, that is, merely for the sake of serving Harijans.
('62', 213, 4, 15, 411106) They are seeking its shelter in order to satisfy other ambitions.
('62', 213, 4, 16, 411172) .I know that you do not desire civil resistance to be mixed up with Harijan service organizations.
('62', 213, 4, 17, 411271) If you propose to make any public use of this letter you may emphasize this last point and make it clearer.
('62', 213, 4, 18, 411379) I am thankful to the friend for giving me the benefit of his experience.
('62', 213, 4, 19, 411452) It is a most difficult task to keep a big organization like the Servants of Untouchables Society with branches all over India free of all selfseekers and timeservers.
('62', 213, 4, 20, 411619) I have discussed the subject fully with Seth Ghanshyamdas and Thakkar Bapa.
('62', 213, 4, 21, 411695) I know that they are both anxious to keep the organization as pure as possible.
('62', 213, 4, 22, 411775) Personally I can do no more.
('62', 213, 4, 23, 411804) It was because of my utter helplessness that I undertook the fast of 21 days.
('62', 213, 4, 24, 411882) On discovering impurities amongst Harijan servants, I saw that it was no use merely writing about impurities.
('62', 213, 4, 25, 411992) I was searching for a way out of the difficulty.
('62', 213, 4, 26, 412041) The reader should believe me when I tell him that the fast was the last thing in the world that I was thinking of, but as I have described in these pages, it came to me all of a sudden and gave me great relief.
('62', 213, 4, 27, 412252) I know that it did much good.
('62', 213, 4, 28, 412282) But, how far could the fast of a single mortal go ?
('62', 213, 5, 29, 412334) 1 What follows was addressed to Harijans.
('62', 213, 5, 30, 412376) 2 Only extracts from the letter are reporduced here.
('62', 214, 0, 1, 412429) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 215
('62', 214, 1, 2, 412476) it was that I developed the idea of a chain of such purificatory fasts.
('62', 214, 1, 3, 412548) The idea has by no means been dropped.
('62', 214, 1, 4, 412587) It comes to me again and again.
('62', 214, 1, 5, 412619) But it does not admit of a mechanical organization.
('62', 214, 1, 6, 412671) Several co workers are ready to inaugurate or take part in the chain after it is inaugurated, but I have not yet found the way to begin it.
('62', 214, 1, 7, 412811) The proper way will have to come to me or to the coworkers before the chain can be begun.
('62', 214, 1, 8, 412901) Meanwhile I can only reiterate my conviction that untouchability will not be removed root and branch except through the service of men and women who take it up for its own sake and in a religious spirit.
('62', 214, 1, 9, 413105) Unless we have a fair number of such servants throughout the length and breadth of India, we will never succeed in changing the hearts of millions of human beings.
('62', 214, 1, 10, 413269) The savarna Hindus are at one end, Harijans at the other, and the evil custom of ages, which has assumed the dignity of religious tenet, will not be uprooted without penance and purification.
('62', 214, 1, 11, 413461) Whilst it gladdens my heart that thousands of people flock to the meetings that are being held in towns and villages and that they willingly give their pices as a token of their approval of the movement, I am painfully conscious of the fact that, if the thousands were suddenly called upon to enforce in their own lives what they seem to approve by their attendance at these meetings, they would fail to respond, not from want of will, but from sheer inability.
('62', 214, 1, 12, 413923) I have discovered this again and again amongst my closest associates who have frankly confessed their inability to enforce immediately in their conduct what they knew was the right thing and what they knew had to be done immediately.
('62', 214, 1, 13, 414157) They had to put up a brave fight against their traditional repugnance.
('62', 214, 1, 14, 414228) The mere intellectual grasp that untou chability is an evil, corroding Hinduism, and that belief in it is tanta mount to disbelief in God, His goodness and His Fatherhood, is not enough to destroy the monster.
('62', 214, 1, 15, 414438) The vicarious penance of the com paratively pure is needed to bring about a change in the hearts of both savarnas and Harijans.
('62', 214, 1, 16, 414566) A movement, so grand and so pure, so religious and so humanitarian, must not be exploited by anybody for his own end.
('62', 214, 1, 17, 414684) Certainly, not for its political consequences.
('62', 214, 1, 18, 414731) It will be discovered, as the movement progresses, that the political approach can only end in accentuating the strife.
('62', 214, 1, 19, 414851) It can only add to the confusion already existing and add one more, if not many more warring parties, to the existing ones.
('62', 214, 1, 20, 414975) May God save us and save the movement from such a calamity !
('62', 214, 1, 21, 415036) So far as the connection of civil resistance with the movement is
('62', 215, 0, 1, 415102) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 216
('62', 215, 1, 2, 415144) concerned, I am as emphatic as ever that Congressmen who desire to offer active civil resistance should not accept office in the various organizations, and much less can they be used for serving the purpose of civil resistance.
('62', 215, 1, 3, 415372) Civil resistance is a unique weapon, it does not admit of alloy.
('62', 215, 1, 4, 415437) It is a weapon of the fearless and, therefore, needs no shelter; but it has to be wielded in the open daylight.
('62', 215, 1, 5, 415549) Therefore, whilst Congressmen who are also civil resisters on active service may do, as they are bound to do, such service to the cause as they can, they may not belong to the Servants of Untouchables Society or any of its branches.
('62', 215, 1, 6, 415782) By holding office in the organizations they will harm both civil resistance and the Harijan cause.
('62', 215, 1, 7, 415881) It would be like a man going to a temple to pray and using the act of worship for advancing civil resistance.
('62', 215, 1, 8, 415991) Neither God nor man will be cheated in that manner and, as I have said often enough in these columns, the great reformation of Hinduism will not be brought about, if it is to depend purely upon Congressmen.
('62', 215, 1, 9, 416198) For, much as I would like to think that every Indian is Congressman, I know that such is not the case.
('62', 215, 1, 10, 416301) Nor is every Hindu a Congressman, if only because every Harijan is not a Congressman.
('62', 215, 1, 11, 416387) Therefore, a Harijan organization must in the very nature of things be strictly nonpolitical and nonparty and should contain in it both Congressmen and nonCongressmen, officeholding being restricted to those who are not active civil resisters and who will not exploit the office secretly or openly to advance the cause of civil resistance.

('62', 215, 2, 13, 416745) 233. HARIJAN WORKERS DUTY
('62', 215, 3, 14, 416771) A correspondent sends me the following questions for answering :
('62', 215, 4, 15, 416836) (1) In the propaganda against untouchability, should a worker make use of the Hindu Shastras and religious texts to show that Hinduism does not sanction untouchability as we practise it today ?
('62', 215, 5, 16, 417030) (2) Should a Harijan sevak, even in his private capacity, take part in inter dining functions ?
('62', 215, 6, 17, 417126) (3) Should a Harijan who is employed as a domestic servant sit at meals alongside all the members of the family ?
('62', 215, 6, 18, 417240) These three questions, the correspondent says, have been seriously discussed in the columns of a newspaper and the readers have been advised that Harijan workers ought not to make use of religious texts in advocating the abolition of untouchability, and that,
('62', 216, 0, 1, 417500) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 217
('62', 216, 1, 2, 417547) in the larger interest of the movement, the workers should not enforce their views about interdining and the rest, even in their private matters.
('62', 216, 1, 3, 417693) I hold totally different views on these matters.
('62', 216, 1, 4, 417742) For me, the removal of untouchability is fundamentally a religious question.
('62', 216, 1, 5, 417819) Hinduism could not hold me if I believed that untouchability, as it is practised today, was an integral part of it.
('62', 216, 1, 6, 417935) That it has been handed down to us as a custom is an undoubted fact, but so are many other bad customs among which untouchability is the worst.
('62', 216, 1, 7, 418079) It becomes necessary, therefore, to show that it has no sanction in religion.
('62', 216, 1, 8, 418157) Whilst the Servants of Untouchables Society has very wisely limited the scope of its corporate activities, it does not regulate or restrict individual practice about interdining.
('62', 216, 1, 9, 418336) The removal of untou chability does not require interdining with Harijans.
('62', 216, 1, 10, 418411) Interdining is not a universal obligation.
('62', 216, 1, 11, 418454) A Harijan worker must be left free to dine with whomsoever he pleases, and, therefore, with Harijans, without in any way being regarded as being on that account a less effective worker.
('62', 216, 1, 12, 418640) My own practice is well known, and I should personally feel a hypocrite if I suppressed it in the larger interests of the reform.
('62', 216, 1, 13, 418770) I should undoubtedly refrain, if interdining were a mere matter of convenience or indulgence for me.
('62', 216, 1, 14, 418871) Far from being either, I regard it as a desirable and an inevitable social reform.
('62', 216, 1, 15, 418954) But it should not be mixed up with the drive against untouchability.
('62', 216, 1, 16, 419023) The central point in the untouchability movement is the removal of social and religious injustice towards those who, being regarded as untouchables, are debarred from public utilities and spiritual comfort within the religion to which they belong.
('62', 216, 1, 17, 419271) I should feel no deprivation if no one in the world took food that might be cooked or touched by me.
('62', 216, 1, 18, 419372) But it would be a great deprivation to me if I could not send my children to the public school, or could not rent a house in any locality open to the other members of the public, or could not seek spiritual comfort in a temple designed for the other members of my faith.
('62', 216, 1, 19, 419643) As to the Harijan employee, if the members of a family employing a Harijan drew a line between him and nonHarijan ser vants, they would undoubtedly be guilty of observing untouc hability.
('62', 216, 1, 20, 419831) But I very much fear that we are a long way from that bright and happy day when we shall be all masters and no servants, or all servants and no masters, all members of the human family, regarding ourselves as bloodbrothers and bloodsisters.

('62', 217, 8, 14, 420604) November 24, 1933
('62', 217, 9, 15, 420622) MY DEAR CHARLIE, I have just heard from Sir P. Pattani that he would begin to pay Gurudev Rs. 1,000 per month from December till the Rs. 5,000 are paid out.
('62', 217, 9, 16, 420779) 1 It will be all right now.
('62', 217, 9, 17, 420807) The enthusiasm of the people and the attendance are phenomenal and exceed my expectations which were fairly high.
('62', 217, 9, 18, 420921) You will find it all faithfully described in the columns of Harijan which as you must have observed has been transferred to Madras.
('62', 217, 9, 19, 421053) The people are paying handsomely.
('62', 217, 9, 20, 421087) If these crowds are not an indication that untouchability is fast going, I do not know what can prove it.
('62', 217, 9, 21, 421193) It must take time for the mighty reform to be felt.
('62', 217, 9, 22, 421245) Later, The foregoing was written amid interruptions.
('62', 217, 9, 23, 421298) Your letter written during the voyage or in Bombay has just been received.
('62', 217, 9, 24, 421373) About Gurudevs visit to Bombay I have written very little.
('62', 217, 9, 25, 421432) I do not even know what is going on.

('62', 218, 1, 2, 421609) of course he would be quite all right in so far as the reception is concerned.
('62', 218, 1, 3, 421688) Of money he is not likely to get much.
('62', 218, 1, 4, 421727) My appeal about Orissa is bringing very little.
('62', 218, 1, 5, 421775) Of course, Elwin should go his way and be left in Gods hands.
('62', 218, 1, 6, 421837) But friends must issue warnings when they have doubts as to the propriety of actions on merits.
('62', 218, 1, 7, 421933) It is difficult to say when it is Gods voice and when it is not.
('62', 218, 1, 8, 421998) Strangers have to judge every act on its merits.
('62', 218, 1, 9, 422047) This is applicable of course to my claim in connection with my fasts.
('62', 218, 1, 10, 422117) I wrote a long letter to E. on what appeared to me his hasty departure from Matheran and avoidance of Wardha.
('62', 218, 1, 11, 422227) I have not heard from him at all after his going back to Karanjia.
('62', 218, 1, 12, 422294) I hope I shall not have to cable you to return.
('62', 218, 1, 13, 422342) The Magistrates have not worried me up to now.
('62', 218, 1, 14, 422389) And when and if they do you would be too late for guidance.
('62', 218, 1, 15, 422449) You should therefore trust me to God even as Efy is doing, even as you are trusting E. to God.

('62', 218, 6, 25, 422955) It is as bad as ever.
('62', 218, 6, 26, 422977) It does not worry me much and it will not worry me at all if there was chivalry and gentlemanliness on the part of the officials.

('62', 219, 8, 25, 424398) November 24, 1933 Ever since I came to your province you have been showering love on me and I am still bathing in it.
('62', 219, 8, 26, 424516) Here also you have further delighted me by presenting me this purse.
('62', 219, 8, 27, 424585) You would be right if you believe that you should give me money to please me, and especially so if you fulfil one condition.
('62', 219, 8, 28, 424710) It is that those who have given money should feel that they have contributed to a yajna of selfpurification.
('62', 219, 8, 29, 424819) The money that is given can only be a token of your contribution to that yajna.
('62', 219, 8, 30, 424899) But if they think that they have done all that they need to by giving the money, it would be the worst characteristic of a clever Bania.
('62', 219, 8, 31, 425036) It would be as if by giving that money they had bought the right to enjoy themselves as they wished.
('62', 219, 8, 32, 425137) Such charity can be of no

('62', 220, 1, 2, 425210) benefit to the Harijans.
('62', 220, 1, 3, 425235) I do not deny that money is very badly needed for Harijan work; but it is more important for their service that you should accept the Harijans with your heart.
('62', 220, 1, 4, 425395) The real purpose of this tour is that you should discard the notion of untouchability from your heart and banish feelings of high and low.
('62', 220, 1, 5, 425534) If you give me no help in realizing that aim and give me only money, it would be difficult even to use that money.
('62', 220, 1, 6, 425649) If you do not know it, please note that at least 75 per cent of the money collected from this place will be used for the Harijan work here.
('62', 220, 1, 7, 425789) There are two conditions, however, and they are also meant for the success of this work.
('62', 220, 1, 8, 425878) In the first place, a good scheme for the use of that amount should come from you, and along with that there should be an indication of the persons who would carry out the scheme.
('62', 220, 1, 9, 426058) A scheme may be good on paper, but it will be useless and will fail if there was nobody to implement it.
('62', 220, 1, 10, 426163) That is why I said that, if your heart is not behind your contribution, the money you have given will be as good as useless.
('62', 220, 1, 11, 426288) And if this happens, it would be diverted to other places where better workers and better schemes are forthcoming.
('62', 220, 1, 12, 426403) You would not be happy if this happens.
('62', 220, 1, 13, 426443) We who have come here do not wish to do any such thing.
('62', 220, 1, 14, 426499) Our intention is to use at least 75 per cent of the money in the place from where it is collected.
('62', 220, 1, 15, 426598) If, however, you do not give your full cooperation in this work, nothing can be done with the money alone.
('62', 220, 1, 16, 426705) It is a matter of joy for the country and for Hindus that at every place people gather in such large numbers.
('62', 220, 1, 17, 426815) I am working in the faith that all these people come to the meetings to help me in my work of removing untouchability.
('62', 220, 1, 18, 426934) If they come because they think that I have served the country in the past, and in order to praise my past services, they are guilty of great deception.
('62', 220, 1, 19, 427087) I think of no other work just now.
('62', 220, 1, 20, 427122) I have undertaken this tour only for Harijan work, and not to hear my praises.
('62', 220, 1, 21, 427201) Hence, only those who wish to help me in this work or criticize it should attend the meetings.
('62', 220, 1, 22, 427296) Those who wish to oppose the work should express their opposition courteously and in a becoming manner.
('62', 220, 1, 23, 427400) In a religious cause, forgetting courtesy means forsaking dharma itself.
('62', 220, 1, 24, 427473) Rudeness and lack of courtesy go ill with religion.
('62', 220, 1, 25, 427525) Religion must be accompanied with gentleness, courtesy, culture and compassion.
('62', 220, 1, 26, 427605) I do not wish to waste my time.
('62', 220, 1, 27, 427637) It would no doubt pain me to know that the Hindu masses are not with me.
('62', 220, 1, 28, 427710) But it would pain me all the more if they attend the meetings to deceive me and themselves.
('62', 220, 1, 29, 427802) I have got to follow my dharma even if everybody deserts me.
('62', 220, 1, 30, 427863) The scriptures say that you
('62', 221, 0, 1, 427891) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 222
('62', 221, 1, 2, 427933) need not have anyone on your side for following dharma, that you need God alone.
('62', 221, 1, 3, 428014) Following dharma is a matter for each individual himself.
('62', 221, 1, 4, 428072) One must do ones duty to the best of ones ability.
('62', 221, 1, 5, 428123) God will look after the rest.
('62', 221, 1, 6, 428153) The dharma of fighting untouchability is precious like a gem.
('62', 221, 1, 7, 428215) I have placed it before you.
('62', 221, 1, 8, 428244) This is no ordinary gem which can be used only by one person or which would wear off by use.
('62', 221, 1, 9, 428337) Millions can use the gem of dharma ; the more the people use it, the brighter will it shine.
('62', 221, 1, 10, 428430) There is no doubt at all that unless we wipe out the blot of untouchability from Hinduism, both Hinduism and Hindu society will perish.
('62', 221, 1, 11, 428566) Peoples and their religions are being compared and judged all over the world.
('62', 221, 1, 12, 428644) We are living in an age when we can travel to distant places in a few days by train and go round the world by sea.
('62', 221, 1, 13, 428759) And now aeroplanes too are coming into use.
('62', 221, 1, 14, 428803) In an age like this, all religions are exposed to the eyes of the world.
('62', 221, 1, 15, 428876) If we fail in this scrutiny we may be sure that we are doomed.
('62', 221, 1, 16, 428939) The world has a right to make such a comparison.
('62', 221, 1, 17, 428988) That which cannot be placed before the world and which is not acceptable to reason and the heart cannot be sanatana dharma.
('62', 221, 1, 18, 429112) Sanatana dharma means imperishable Truth.
('62', 221, 1, 19, 429154) I was glad when I was told that Bharatdasji intends to throw open his temple to Harijans.
('62', 221, 1, 20, 429244) The site of the temple is very beautiful.
('62', 221, 1, 21, 429286) I performed the opening with God as witness.
('62', 221, 1, 22, 429331) The Harijans had cheerfully come in large numbers.
('62', 221, 1, 23, 429382) The scriptures have laid down two or three conditions for the Harijans or other people who visit a temple.
('62', 221, 1, 24, 429489) They must enter the temple with a pure heart and body.
('62', 221, 1, 25, 429544) Observing rules of personal cleanliness is as necessary in the case of Harijans as in that of the other Hindus, and, therefore, they should be duly observed by them.
('62', 221, 1, 26, 429710) The second condition is that they should give up eating beef and carrion.
('62', 221, 1, 27, 429784) The latter is prohibited in every religion.
('62', 221, 1, 28, 429828) I am not aware of civilized and religiousminded people eating carrion, anywhere in the world.
('62', 221, 1, 29, 429922) It is abhorred by all mankind.
('62', 221, 1, 30, 429953) Harijans must give up these two things irrespective of whether or not they are accepted by the caste Hindus.
('62', 221, 1, 31, 430062) If they consider themselves Hindus, they must give up beef also.
('62', 221, 1, 32, 430127) Now there is a fourth thing, which I cannot describe as an inseparable part of Hinduism, though it is so according to me.
('62', 221, 1, 33, 430249) And that is abstention from intoxicating drinks.
('62', 221, 1, 34, 430298) Other Hindus may or may not give them up, but you should definitely do so.
('62', 221, 1, 35, 430373) It is a very bad habit.
('62', 221, 1, 36, 430397) A bad habit should not be copied.
('62', 221, 1, 37, 430431) Moreover, you want to progress, and so you must give up drinking.
('62', 221, 1, 38, 430497) Other Hindus will follow your example.

('62', 222, 1, 2, 430613) will save the country crores of rupees and change a man from a monster into a human being.
('62', 222, 1, 3, 430704) You must not consume the thing that makes you forget how you should behave to a mother or a sister.
('62', 222, 1, 4, 430804) Those who are used to collecting and eating leavings must give up that unclean habit for good.
('62', 222, 1, 5, 430899) Eating the leavings is not for human beings.
('62', 222, 1, 6, 430944) It is the fault of the caste Hindus that you have got into this habit.
('62', 222, 1, 7, 431015) In their ignorance caste Hindu women give leavings to Harijans.
('62', 222, 1, 8, 431079) Instead of that, they should keep apart a certain portion every day for Harijans from what they may have cooked for themselves.
('62', 222, 1, 9, 431207) My mother always used to feed us and take her meal only after keeping apart the portions for the guest, the poor and the cow.
('62', 222, 1, 10, 431333) It is a cultured tradition in a good household that such portions be kept apart.
('62', 222, 1, 11, 431414) Similarly, you also should take out something for the Bhangi Harijans and give it to them with love.
('62', 222, 1, 12, 431515) It is not civil to throw food in the fold of the dress or in a vessel from a distance.
('62', 222, 1, 13, 431602) It is an act of contempt.
('62', 222, 1, 14, 431628) There is no politeness in it but lack of it.
('62', 222, 1, 15, 431673) Caste Hindu women should give up throwing leavings to Harijans and the latter should stop accepting them.
('62', 222, 1, 16, 431779) Harijan men and women who visit temples should observe the rules that may be applicable to all the varnas equally.
('62', 222, 1, 17, 431894) The Satnami Harijans at Dhamtari told me the painful story that the barbers and the washermen there do not work for them because they are considered untouchables.
('62', 222, 1, 18, 432057) Those who told me this were as clean as ourselves.
('62', 222, 1, 19, 432108) When I visited their dwellings, I found that they were not more unclean than the houses of other Hindus.
('62', 222, 1, 20, 432213) In the course of my tours in the country, I have got an impression that the houses of Bhangis are cleaner than those of other Hindus.
('62', 222, 1, 21, 432347) It is tyrannical that washermen and barbers should not serve such peple.
('62', 222, 1, 22, 432420) It is painful and a matter of shame for us that when such a great movement of selfpurification is going on barbers and washermen should refuse to serve these people.
('62', 222, 1, 23, 432586) I do not blame the washermen and barbers for this.
('62', 222, 1, 24, 432637) It is the doing of the socalled highcaste Hindus who have misled them.
('62', 222, 1, 25, 432708) They have put the idea into their minds that they would be incurring sin if they worked for the Harijans.
('62', 222, 1, 26, 432814) Since they have got such an idea, they hesitate to serve the Harijans.
('62', 222, 1, 27, 432885) This should not be.
('62', 222, 1, 28, 432905) Other people who know better should explain this to the barbers and washermen.
('62', 222, 1, 29, 432984) Educated young men from among the caste Hindus should learn haircutting and washing clothes.
('62', 222, 1, 30, 433077) And they should go to Harijans and tell them that they are ready to cut their hair and wash their clothes.
('62', 222, 1, 31, 433184) If the educated people do this, the simple hearted barbers and washermen would do it too.
('62', 222, 1, 32, 433274) When they find that
('62', 223, 0, 1, 433294) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 224
('62', 223, 1, 2, 433336) even the people who are not bothered about money are doing such work, they also would do it.
('62', 223, 1, 3, 433429) There is no question of religious degradation in this.
('62', 223, 1, 4, 433484) No sanatanist has told me that barbers, washermen, doctors, etc., cannot serve Harijans.
('62', 223, 1, 5, 433573) I do not know how the idea that it is dharma to refuse such service originated.
('62', 223, 1, 6, 433653) Such barbarism should go forthwith.

('62', 223, 6, 11, 433787) DEAR SISTER,
('62', 223, 7, 12, 433800) I do not read newspapers.
('62', 223, 7, 13, 433826) But I take it you came back on the date mentioned in Mridus letter.
('62', 223, 7, 14, 433894) Let me know about the condition of your health.
('62', 223, 7, 15, 433942) I learn from Mahadevs letter that your brother in law who was at Belgaum suddenly died.
('62', 223, 7, 16, 434030) I did not know about it at all.
('62', 223, 7, 17, 434062) What consolation could one give you?
('62', 223, 7, 18, 434099) You will all be well.
('62', 223, 7, 19, 434121) You can treat Wardha as my permanent address.

('62', 224, 2, 3, 434356) November 25, 1933
('62', 224, 3, 4, 434374) Gandhiji declared open to Harijans a private temple, saying that the temple had on that day become a true abode of God with the Harijans entry into it.
('62', 224, 3, 5, 434526) Asking Harijans to observe three conditions of templeentry, which apply equally to all templegoing Hindus, he said : I request you to contribute your full share to this movement of selfpurification, not by money but by a thorough cleansing of the heart and body and by removing the evil habits that have crept in amongst you.
('62', 224, 3, 6, 434852) Though I admit with shame that the caste Hindus are responsible for many of these evil habits, I should like you to do your own part by giving up carrion and beefeating and observing the common rules of cleanliness.
('62', 224, 3, 7, 435068) These three conditions apply equally to all Hindus who want the right of worship in Hindu temples.
('62', 224, 3, 8, 435167) I should like you to give up drink also, irrespective of the fact that even some caste Hindus indulge in that intoxication.
('62', 224, 3, 9, 435291) You may not imitate their vices.
('62', 224, 3, 10, 435324) Drink is one of the most degrading of vices, reducing man to the state of brute.
('62', 224, 3, 11, 435405) It vitiates both body and soul.
('62', 224, 3, 12, 435437) It spells utter ruin of the moral and domestic life.
('62', 224, 3, 13, 435490) I would, therefore, request Harijans in all earnestness to give up that vice and set a noble example of self purification not only to caste Hindus but perhaps to the whole world.

('62', 224, 6, 16, 435712) November 25, 1933 You may know, if you do not know already, that I have been closely assoicated with labourers ever since I went to South Africa.
('62', 224, 6, 17, 435858) Whenever I have gone among labourers, in South Africa, India or whatever part of the world, they have recognized me as a fellow labourer and received me as one of themselves.
('62', 224, 6, 18, 436033) You will perhaps be surprised to know that even labourers in Lancashire instinctively

('62', 224, 8, 20, 436190) 2 Delivered at the B. N. Railway Labourers Federation.
('62', 224, 8, 21, 436245) This appeared in Harijan in two parts under the titles A Great Equalizer and On Behalf of Humanity.
('62', 225, 0, 1, 436345) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 226
('62', 225, 1, 2, 436387) recognized me as one of themselves and flocked around me in hundreds and thousands.
('62', 225, 1, 3, 436471) The only difference between us is that I have become a labourer by choice whilst you have been made labourers by force of circumstances and would perhaps love to be masters if you could.
('62', 225, 1, 4, 436658) I early gave up the ambition of becoming the master for I would then have belonged to an inconsiderate class and could not have identified myself, as I do today to the best of my ability, with the penniless pauper, the halfstarved and the naked, the lowliest and the lost.
('62', 225, 1, 5, 436931) I want labourers not to deplore, much less to despise, their lot and to realize the dignity of labour.
('62', 225, 1, 6, 437034) It is meet that you have come forward with your purse as a token of your sympathy with the Harijans.
('62', 225, 1, 7, 437135) Who has suffered so much as they ?
('62', 225, 1, 8, 437170) They are at the lowest rung of the ladder.
('62', 225, 1, 9, 437213) The terrible hardships and privations they have to undergo can never be imagined by those who have not been victims to them.
('62', 225, 1, 10, 437338) Other labourers may aspire to a mass wealth and to become masters some day and thus to rise in the scale of social prestige; but the Harijans can never entertain that ambition.
('62', 225, 1, 11, 437515) The stigma of untouchability attaches to them from the mothers womb.
('62', 225, 1, 12, 437584) They are born outcastes and remain outcastes till death.
('62', 225, 1, 13, 437641) They have to live in segregated areas and are denied the amenities of life that the others enjoy.
('62', 225, 1, 14, 437739) Even water, that free gift of God, is denied to them.
('62', 225, 1, 15, 437793) I ask the Labour Federation to abolish all distinctions between Harijans and yourselves.
('62', 225, 1, 16, 437882) I make the appeal deliberately for, being in direct touch with the millhands in Ahmedabad, I know that labourers do observe the distinction between Harijans and nonHarijans.
('62', 225, 1, 17, 438056) I expect labourers, more than all others, to efface these distinctions.
('62', 225, 1, 18, 438128) It has been my deep faith that we shall some day achieve communal unity through labourers.
('62', 225, 1, 19, 438219) I consider labour to be a powerful unifying agent.
('62', 225, 1, 20, 438270) It is a great equalizer.
('62', 225, 1, 21, 438295) It should be a matter of shame to have communal divisions among labourers, who all earn their bread by the sweat of their brow and, therefore, belong to one vast brotherhood.
('62', 225, 1, 22, 438470) Let them, therefore, begin with a thorough removal of untouchability.
('62', 225, 1, 23, 438540) It will be a great step towards communal unity.
('62', 225, 1, 24, 438588) Once the bar sinister against Harijans is removed, the way will be open for a wider unity among Hindus, Mussalmans and other sister communities.
('62', 225, 2, 25, 438733) A Mussalman friend asked why Gandhiji, a national leader, had chosen for the time being to work only among a section of the nation.
('62', 225, 2, 26, 438865) This question drew the following reply from Gandhiji.
('62', 225, 2, 27, 438919) I am trying to serve all communities today through this work.
('62', 225, 2, 28, 438981) They are branches of one big family.
('62', 225, 2, 29, 439018) I have found in the Hindu
('62', 226, 0, 1, 439044) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 227
('62', 226, 1, 2, 439091) branch a disease which, if not removed in time, will spread through the whole family and destroy it.
('62', 226, 1, 3, 439192) The evil of untouchability has travelled far beyond its prescribed limits.
('62', 226, 1, 4, 439267) In trying to root out untouchability among Hindus, I am trying to serve all the communities.
('62', 226, 1, 5, 439360) Though the method of achieving communal unity through conferences has failed, I have not despaired of a heartunity being achieved in the end.
('62', 226, 1, 6, 439502) God has sent me this work, and I am doing it in the faith that the way to a real communal unity will be paved through it.
('62', 226, 1, 7, 439624) It is thus to my mind a service of the whole nation.
('62', 226, 1, 8, 439677) The effort I made in 192021 to achieve HinduMuslim unity will go down in history and will serve as the foundation of the edifice of communal unity whenever it is achieved.
('62', 226, 1, 9, 439849) I have never repented for having made that effort.
('62', 226, 1, 10, 439900) For me it was not a matter of expedience.
('62', 226, 1, 11, 439942) I am not aware of having done a single thing in my life as a matter of expedience.
('62', 226, 1, 12, 440025) I have ever held that the highest morality is also the highest expedience.
('62', 226, 1, 13, 440100) Some European friends assure me that I am waging this war against untouchability on behalf of the whole of humanity.
('62', 226, 1, 14, 440217) Once this canker is removed from Hinduism, Hindus, Mussalmans and others will sink their differences and will embrace one another as bloodbrothers, and all communities will feel that they are all branches of the same tree.

('62', 226, 4, 17, 440490) RAIPUR, November 26, 1933
('62', 226, 5, 18, 440516) MY DEAR AMALA, What have you done to your finger ?
('62', 226, 5, 19, 440567) Dwarakanathji says you have hurt yourself.
('62', 226, 5, 20, 440610) I hope you are not overstraining yourself.
('62', 226, 5, 21, 440653) I want you to do everything with joy and infinite patience.
('62', 226, 5, 22, 440713) It appears that on the 15th December we shall be passing through Wardha as was originally arranged.
('62', 226, 5, 23, 440813) The programme was altered so as to omit Wardha and go via Calcutta.
('62', 226, 5, 24, 440881) But now the original programme has been restored.
('62', 226, 5, 25, 440931) While I admire your selfrestraint in not coming to the station last time, I would like you to come on the 15th, if you get Dwarakanathjis permission.
('62', 226, 5, 26, 441081) I see that you are spinning much better than you used to, and you have prepared your strand nicely and neatly.
('62', 226, 5, 27, 441192) I am sure that by proper application you would be able to spin finer, stronger and much

('62', 227, 1, 2, 441322) more even.
('62', 227, 1, 3, 441333) I hope that there is not much waste nowadays and that you know how to mend your wheel if it goes out of order.
('62', 227, 1, 4, 441444) I hope you are just as happy as our Japanese friend.
('62', 227, 1, 5, 441497) You will be surprised to know, when years ago in South Africa I first cut my own hair, it looked as if rats had been at it.
('62', 227, 1, 6, 441621) My lawyer friends cracked jokes at my expense.
('62', 227, 1, 7, 441668) But I survived their jokes and I was able to do much better next time.
('62', 227, 1, 8, 441739) The same thing happened with my first trial at ironing shirts and collars.
('62', 227, 1, 9, 441814) I do not mention this incident to induce you to repeat your experiment.
('62', 227, 1, 10, 441886) You should get your hair cut by the barber who gets a fixed salary no matter how many heads he treats.

('62', 227, 12, 20, 442375) JAMNALAL, I got your letter.
('62', 227, 12, 21, 442404) Lakshmidas seems to have written what he did on the basis of what Anandi might have told him.
('62', 227, 12, 22, 442498) I hope you remember that she had even come to know the name.
('62', 227, 12, 23, 442559) But we neednt worry about this.
('62', 227, 12, 24, 442591) Lakshmidas is not likely to misunderstand anything.
('62', 227, 12, 25, 442643) I am sure that you didnt divulge the name.
('62', 227, 12, 26, 442686) I have written to Dwarakanath about the honey.

('62', 228, 1, 4, 442978) He seems to be expecting that you will attend.
('62', 228, 1, 5, 443025) Do you feel inclined to come ?
('62', 228, 1, 6, 443056) If you dont wish to, I will not mind.
('62', 228, 1, 7, 443094) Come if you feel like it.
('62', 228, 1, 8, 443120) This will mean that you will have to leave that place on the 3rd or the 4th instead of on the 7th.
('62', 228, 1, 9, 443219) I certainly dont like that you should sacrifice so many days from your stay there.
('62', 228, 1, 10, 443302) Mathuradas is coming here tomorrow.
('62', 228, 1, 11, 443338) I dont know what brings him here.
('62', 228, 1, 12, 443372) I observe that Om has a sharp intelligence.
('62', 228, 1, 13, 443416) And she has simple habits, too.
('62', 228, 1, 14, 443448) She has fine health.
('62', 228, 1, 15, 443469) She seems to be enjoying everything.
('62', 228, 1, 16, 443506) I also give her some writing work.

('62', 228, 1, 21, 443675) Is Kamla progressing satisfactorily ?

('62', 231, 5, 13, 447516) AS AT WARDHA, November 26, 1933 DEAR JANAKDHARI BABU, I have your letter.
('62', 231, 5, 14, 447590) I wish that I could have a heart to heart chat with you.
('62', 231, 5, 15, 447647) I shall try to write to you at length in spite of the pressure under which I am working.
('62', 231, 5, 16, 447736) But I know that the letter will never yield the result that a brief conversation can.
('62', 231, 5, 17, 447822) From your letter, I had gathered that you were not fit to seek imprisonment, and knowing your domestic difficulties as I now do, I feel that until those difficulties are satisfactorily solved you ought not to think of imprisonment.
('62', 231, 5, 18, 448054) By labour I mean any kind of physical labour that you may be able to perform.
('62', 231, 5, 19, 448132) Such labour for you is tailoring, shoemaking and any other healthy labour that you can think of.
('62', 231, 5, 20, 448229) Whilst you will not immediately earn much, it will mean a mighty revolution in your life.
('62', 231, 5, 21, 448319) Your children will then be brought up as labourers.
('62', 231, 5, 22, 448371) 2 As such they will not have to struggle so much to live, as you do just now.
('62', 231, 5, 23, 448449) And when your attitude is changed, you will set for yourself and the whole family the labourers standard of life.
('62', 231, 5, 24, 448563) Your wife, if she accepts the revolutionary change, will also be doing her share of labour.

('62', 232, 1, 2, 448774) You will be interested to know that my sister 1, because she will not live in the Ashram, owing to non observance of untouchability, earns about Rs. 15 per month by grinding.
('62', 232, 1, 3, 448949) Giri, who with her three daughters and two sons was in the Ashram for seven years and whom I declined to support on the breaking up to the Ashram, but whom I advised to take to some labour is now earning from the labour of her two daughters nearly Rs. 30 per month by preparing sweetmeats and fritters for a hotel keeper.
('62', 232, 1, 4, 449271) And her son isearning about the same as a carpenter.
('62', 232, 1, 5, 449324) Dal Bahadur Giri was not a labourer.
('62', 232, 1, 6, 449361) He was living an almost aristocratic life.
('62', 232, 1, 7, 449404) I believe that the widow and her daughters are happy.
('62', 232, 1, 8, 449458) They have not cut off all connections with me.
('62', 232, 1, 9, 449505) Two daughters are grown up girls, marriageable, but have no present intention of marrying.
('62', 232, 1, 10, 449596) They can read and write but they have learned the dignity of labour, and therefore are not a burden on society.
('62', 232, 1, 11, 449708) Now I hope you understand what I mean by physical labour.
('62', 232, 1, 12, 449766) Now for the education of your children.
('62', 232, 1, 13, 449806) If you accept the revolution that I have suggested, naturally the children will be brought up by you.
('62', 232, 1, 14, 449908) You will give them not merely a literary training but you will give them also a training for labour with their hands.
('62', 232, 1, 15, 450026) Immediately you begin this life you will find it to be a pleasure and all your difficulties will automatically be solved, and you will be rendering a distinct service to society by setting a wise example.
('62', 232, 1, 16, 450231) I do want you to get out of the mood of despondency and helplessness.
('62', 232, 1, 17, 450301) Do write again if this does not explain all I mean.

('62', 233, 7, 16, 451497) Tulsidasji has offered us a Gita in the form of Ramanama to cope with such a situation.
('62', 233, 7, 17, 451585) We do not have to commit Ramanama to our memoryit is done no sooner than it is utteredwhat we are required to do is to commit it to our hearts.
('62', 233, 7, 18, 451729) Regard Ramanama as the true medicine for you.
('62', 233, 7, 19, 451775) If God spares your life, you should teach the small children of your family to recite from the Gita.

('62', 233, 12, 27, 452141) November 27, 1933 When I received your invitation I felt at once that, if the Reception Committee here could make the necessary time, I would love to address this audience of students who, when they have finished

('62', 234, 0, 1, 452420) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 235
('62', 234, 1, 2, 452467) their education, will be called upon to bear a great responsibility and burden.
('62', 234, 1, 3, 452547) And it was a matter of great pleasure to me that the Reception Committee was able to set apart one hour for this function.
('62', 234, 1, 4, 452670) I thank you, Sir, for having extended this invitation to me, thereby enabling me to deliver my message to the youths who are at present under your kind care.
('62', 234, 1, 5, 452828) You were thoughtful enough to send a message to my host, Shuklaji 1that, whilst I could address this audience in Hindustani if I so chose, you would appreciate it if I addressed them in English; and you were good enough, when I exchanged a letter with you, to tell me that many of the boys under your care did not know Hindustani.
('62', 234, 1, 6, 453159) I at once decided to address you, in spite of my ordinary practice to the contrary, in English.
('62', 234, 1, 7, 453255) Your Principal inadvertently supplied me also with a text for my message.
('62', 234, 1, 8, 453329) I would like you, sons of Chiefs in these territories, to remember that you would be expected not merely to confine yourselves, in these days of progressive enlightenment and rapid intercommunication, to your comparatively very small territories, but you would be expected to extend your horizon; and if you will do so, as I have no doubt you will be obliged to do by force of circumstances, it will be necessary for you not merely to know the languages of the province in which your lot is cast, but you will be expected to know also the language that is most universally used in this country.
('62', 234, 1, 9, 453924) And you may not know, all of you, I am sure, do not know, that over 22 crores of the people of this country know sufficient Hindi or Hindustani to be able to understand what is spoken to them and to express themselves, however broken their language may be.
('62', 234, 1, 10, 454181) No Indian having to shoulder the responsibility that you will have to shoulder can possibly afford to ignore such a universal language.
('62', 234, 1, 11, 454317) There is a method in my mad love of Hindi.
('62', 234, 1, 12, 454360) I am a lover of the English language, and I would like to speak in the English language as well as is possible for a foreigner to do and compete with Englishmen.
('62', 234, 1, 13, 454522) I know that I am far away from that consummation.
('62', 234, 1, 14, 454572) Whatever English I know is due to my having lived for years among Englishmen and Englishspeaking men.
('62', 234, 1, 15, 454674) I count hundreds of English men and women as close friends.
('62', 234, 1, 16, 454734) So you will not misunderstand me when I tell you that it is your duty to understand Hindustani and I will beg the Principal and his staff to realize the special condition of this

('62', 235, 1, 3, 455268) This brings me to the central point of my message.
('62', 235, 1, 4, 455319) We have been in the midst of Englishmen in various walks of life.
('62', 235, 1, 5, 455385) I have had the painful duty very often of criticizing the policy of the rulers.
('62', 235, 1, 6, 455465) I have not minced words.
('62', 235, 1, 7, 455490) I have spoken straight from my heart, but as I have told you, I claim the closest friendship with hundreds of English men.
('62', 235, 1, 8, 455613) I cannot forget some of their priceless virtues.
('62', 235, 1, 9, 455662) I propose to single out one of them for you.
('62', 235, 1, 10, 455707) In England there is a living family tie between its noblemen and their domestic servants.
('62', 235, 1, 11, 455797) It was a matter of joy to me on visiting them in their homes to find that there was a subtle bond of affection between them and their servants.
('62', 235, 1, 12, 455941) There was no untouchability there.
('62', 235, 1, 13, 455976) What I have told you is literally true of hundreds of the noblemen of England.
('62', 235, 1, 14, 456055) Wherever I went, it was an unexpected pleasure to me at the end of the visit ot be introduced to the domestic staff not as inferior beings but as members of the family.
('62', 235, 1, 15, 456224) I wish that you would copy this virtue in your own lives.
('62', 235, 1, 16, 456282) There is unfortunately among us a feeling that Chiefs are Chiefs and they can never make common cause with the ordinary people and so you find the tragedyhowever necessary it may be todaythat special schools and colleges have got to be built for you.
('62', 235, 1, 17, 456533) You dare not, you will not,go to common schools and colleges.You may not know that King Edward and the present King, I am speaking subject to correction, worked in the Navy as if they were ordinary sailors and that both father and son shared the hardships of a sailors life.
('62', 235, 1, 18, 456808) Will you do that ?
('62', 235, 1, 19, 456827) You are confined as it were to hot houses and are taught to believe that you have been gifted with special divinity by God.
('62', 235, 1, 20, 456951) Believe me there is absolutely no difference whatsoever between you and the common folk except this that you have opportunities that are denied to them.
('62', 235, 1, 21, 457104) But if you do not make use of the opportunities God has given you, it will be counted against you in Gods book of accounts.
('62', 235, 1, 22, 457228) Know that the essence of education lies in drawing out the very best that is in you.
('62', 235, 1, 23, 457313) You and I can take the positive comfort that is in you.
('62', 235, 1, 24, 457369) You and I can take the positive comfort that all of us have an equal potential capacity for being good or bad.
('62', 235, 1, 25, 457480) I, therefore, feel that all your education will be vain, if you do not learn the art of feeling one with the poorest in the land.
('62', 235, 1, 26, 457610) This brings me in the natural course to untouchability.
('62', 235, 1, 27, 457666) In no other part of the world has a patent evil like untouchability been claimed to possess religious sanction as it has in Hindu India.
('62', 235, 1, 28, 457803) But, if you have agreed with me so far, you are bound to regard the Harijan
('62', 236, 0, 1, 457879) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 237
('62', 236, 1, 2, 457926) as an integral part of common humanity.
('62', 236, 1, 3, 457966) You have to realize your oneness even with him.
('62', 236, 1, 4, 458014) It may be that your parents will dispute the proposition that untouchability is an unmixed evil.
('62', 236, 1, 5, 458111) You will then have to show the courage of your conviction even as young Prahlad did.
('62', 236, 1, 6, 458196) The idea of hereditary superiority and inferiority is, in my opinion, repugnant to the spirit of Hinduism which teaches oneness of all life in unequivocal terms.
('62', 236, 1, 7, 458358) The religions of mankind are being examined and tested both analytically and synthetically.
('62', 236, 1, 8, 458450) And I have no doubt that, if Hindus cling to untouchability, Hinduism and Hindus will be swept out of existence.
('62', 236, 1, 9, 458563) I cling to Hinduism because it gives me all the solace I need and because I have found in it no warrant for untouchability as we know it today.
('62', 236, 1, 10, 458707) If I have invited you to copy the virtues of Englishmen, I must with deference to English friends present here warn you against their vices.
('62', 236, 1, 11, 458848) That immortal poetsaint Tulsidas has left us a verse 1 full of deep truth.
('62', 236, 1, 12, 458923) He says that we should live even as the fabled swan does, sift virtue from vice and take the former, leaving the latter alone.
('62', 236, 1, 13, 459050) I would have you, therefore, to leave alone their two national vices, drink and races.
('62', 236, 1, 14, 459137) Many Englishmen de plore them.
('62', 236, 1, 15, 459168) I have seen many an English home being ruined by the craving for liquor and gambling at the races.
('62', 236, 1, 16, 459267) And so have many prin ces been ruined by them.
('62', 236, 1, 17, 459314) I hope that you will learn to shun these two evils.

('62', 236, 4, 20, 459415) November 27, 1933
('62', 236, 5, 21, 459433) MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL, Here is Gasavis letter.
('62', 236, 5, 22, 459477) I am telling him, I see no objection to the Party so long as it is not claimed as the Congress Party and that in any case he should seek your advice.
('62', 236, 5, 23, 459627) I note that we are to meet at Jubbulpore on 5th December.
('62', 236, 5, 24, 459685) I shall try to give more time, if it is at all possible.
('62', 236, 5, 25, 459742) Have I not sent you the programme for C.P.?
('62', 236, 5, 26, 459786) More than that was not ready till now.
('62', 236, 5, 27, 459825) So you are being gradually disburdened of shares and the like.
('62', 236, 6, 28, 459888) 1 For the verse from the Ramacharitmanasa,
('62', 237, 0, 1, 459931) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 238
('62', 237, 1, 2, 459973) am not sorry.
('62', 237, 1, 3, 459987) From my point of view the ideal thing would be a voluntary surrender of all the property you have, either to an institution or to those members of the family who do not want to throw themselves into the battle which is bound to be prolonged and perhaps increasingly bitter.
('62', 237, 1, 4, 460261) In the final heat only those will be able to stand who have no property and nowhere to rest their heads on.
('62', 237, 1, 5, 460369) But it is no use worrying over the future.
('62', 237, 1, 6, 460412) Whatever happens you will be found in the front rank.
('62', 237, 1, 7, 460466) I am glad that Mother is making steady progress.
('62', 237, 1, 8, 460515) I wonder if she knows all that is happening.
('62', 237, 1, 9, 460560) Yes, I did read your attack on the Hindu Sabha.
('62', 237, 1, 10, 460608) It might have been less fierce.
('62', 237, 1, 11, 460640) The summary made you speak like a partisan.
('62', 237, 2, 12, 460684) BAPU [P.S.] You will find the dates in the enclosed programme.

('62', 237, 6, 17, 460923) She is a gemhealthy, open, brave, willing and exceedingly intelligent.
('62', 237, 6, 18, 460994) She is only 15 but looks twenty.
('62', 237, 6, 19, 461027) All the member of the party are happy but she seems to be the happiest.
('62', 237, 6, 20, 461099) Of Thakkar Bapa it is difficult to speak in exaggerated language.
('62', 237, 6, 21, 461165) He is the spirit of service personified.
('62', 237, 6, 22, 461206) Most methodical in his work, never allowing arrears, most considerate, yet the most exacting.
('62', 237, 6, 23, 461300) He knows no rest.
('62', 237, 6, 24, 461318) He reads up correspondence in the car.
('62', 237, 6, 25, 461357) He has no time for chatter.
('62', 237, 6, 26, 461385) He could not have made a better secretary I have prized him always as a rare man but I have come ever so much closer to him than before.
('62', 237, 6, 27, 461522) But I must stop now, hoping that you are keeping well.

('62', 239, 9, 14, 463283) It was your duty to write the letter you did; it certainly was your right.
('62', 239, 9, 15, 463358) Your pain is deep.
('62', 239, 9, 16, 463377) A letter from me cannot erase it, but time will.
('62', 239, 9, 17, 463426) It must have been a surprise to you that I did not attend Krishnas wedding.
('62', 239, 9, 18, 463502) Garlands I send to many girls.
('62', 239, 9, 19, 463533) On the death of persons who are Hindus I never send wreaths.
('62', 239, 9, 20, 463594) I did not send wreaths for Motilalji, or Das or Lalaji or Lokamanya and I have never sent wreaths on any occasion of death in India.
('62', 239, 9, 21, 463727) Nobody felt the need for my presence either.
('62', 239, 9, 22, 463772) Before I expressed my opinion as to how Valla bhabhi should proceed, he had himself decided along the same lines.
('62', 239, 9, 23, 463886) I had a letter from him to this effect.
('62', 239, 9, 24, 463926) But I do not expect to convince you by arguments.
('62', 239, 9, 25, 463976) Only believe me that the episode you refer to has absolutely no bearing on the way I acted.
('62', 239, 9, 26, 464068) I have tried to follow to the best of my ability what I considered to be my duty towards Vithal bhai.
('62', 239, 9, 27, 464170) I did not come to Wardha for two days for rest.
('62', 239, 9, 28, 464218) I got two days for silence every week which I naturally spent at Wardha, because the tour that week was to cover the Wardha district and the adjoining areas.
('62', 239, 9, 29, 464376) But that is not a defence.
('62', 239, 9, 30, 464403) If I had considered it my duty to go to

('62', 240, 6, 9, 464775) That the following resolution was unanimously passed on his behalf by the meeting of his representatives held in Bombay on 15th September, 1931, Pandit Malaviyaji being in the Chair :
('62', 240, 7, 10, 464959) This Conference resolves that henceforth, amongst Hindus, no one shall be regarded as an untouchable by reason of his birth, and that those who have been so regarded hitherto will have the same right as other Hindus in regard to the use of public wells, public schools, roads and all other public institutions.
('62', 240, 7, 11, 465270) This right shall have statutory recognition at the first opportunity and shall be one of the earliest Acts of the Swaraj Parliament, if it shall not have received such recognition before that time.
('62', 240, 7, 12, 465468) It is further agreed that it shall be the duty of all Hindu leaders to secure, by every legitimate and peaceful means, an early removal of all social disabilities now imposed by custom upon the socalled untouchable classes, including the bar in respect of admission to temples.

('62', 240, 9, 15, 465774) THE LATE LALA GANGARAM OF SIALKOT It was only through the kind offices of a friend that I came to learn of the recent death of Lala Gangaram.
('62', 240, 9, 16, 465916) He died on the 4th [November] of heart failure, at the age of 60. I had the privilege of meeting him in Lahore at the late Rambhajdutt Chowdhurys house in 1919 when he was introduced to me as a thoroughgoing Harijan worker.
('62', 240, 9, 17, 466140) His was a life of dedication to the Harijan cause.
('62', 240, 9, 18, 466191) He was instrumental in founding Harijan colonies.
('62', 240, 9, 19, 466241) His death is a distinct loss to the cause.
('62', 240, 9, 20, 466284) I offer my condolences to the family of the deceased and to the Harijans who were under his special care.
('62', 240, 10, 21, 466390) 1 This was repeated in the Harijan issues of December 8, 22 and 29 Vide also Resolution at the Hidu Leaders Conference, Bombay,25 9 1932

('62', 241, 1, 2, 466569) AVOID WASTE Reception Committees have been encouraging the habit of presenting flower garlands and bouquets by everyone who will do so.
('62', 241, 1, 3, 466705) Such presentations are a waste of time and money in a tour undertaken on behalf of the lowliest.
('62', 241, 1, 4, 466802) If garlands must be presented, let them consist of undamaged strands of yarn which can be used for weaving.
('62', 241, 1, 5, 466910) There are Harijan weavers who are idle for want of hand spun yarn.
('62', 241, 1, 6, 466977) These will not weave millspun yarn.
('62', 241, 1, 7, 467013) The best thing is to avoid all garlanding.
('62', 241, 1, 8, 467056) And where reception without garlanding is considered impossible, let the garlands be accompained by money.
('62', 241, 1, 9, 467163) The practice of accompanying garlands with money became a feature after Wun and it has already added a few hundred rupees to the amount of donations received.
('62', 241, 1, 10, 467322) Let the public note what one pice means in this country and in the hands of the hungry and despised.
('62', 241, 1, 11, 467423) It makes the dole that charity gives per head to the famishing in flood stricken Orissa.
('62', 241, 1, 12, 467512) Let the doubters see the hovels in which the Harijans are living.
('62', 241, 1, 13, 467578) Let them visit the lowlying Harijan lane of Hinganghat, where in the rainy season it is hardly possible to exist.
('62', 241, 1, 14, 467692) They will then understand the value of the pice that goes into the pocket of a Harijan.
('62', 241, 1, 15, 467780) I would like the public to save their pice and give them to me for the sake of Harijans.
('62', 241, 1, 16, 467869) It will be part payment of the heavy debt caste Hindus owe to Harijans.

('62', 241, 2, 18, 467958) 262. SCHOOL BOOKS
('62', 241, 3, 19, 467976) There seems to me to be no doubt that in the public schools the books used, especially for children, are for the most part useless when they are not harmful.
('62', 241, 3, 20, 468134) That many of them are cleverly written cannot be denied.
('62', 241, 3, 21, 468191) They might even be the best for the people and the environment for which they are written.
('62', 241, 3, 22, 468282) But they are not written for Indian boys and girls, nor for the Indian environment.
('62', 241, 3, 23, 468366) When they are so written, they are generally undigested imitations hardly answering the wants of the scholars.
('62', 241, 3, 24, 468477) In this country, wants vary according to the provinces and the classes of children.
('62', 241, 3, 25, 468561) For instance, wants of Harijan children are, in the beginning stages at least, different from those of the others.
('62', 241, 3, 26, 468676) I have, therefore, come to the conclusion that books are required more for the teachers than for the taught.
('62', 241, 3, 27, 468785) And every teacher, if he is
('62', 242, 0, 1, 468813) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 243
('62', 242, 1, 2, 468860) to do full justice to his pupils, will have to prepare the daily lesson from the material available to him.
('62', 242, 1, 3, 468968) This, too, he will have to suit to the special requirements of his class.
('62', 242, 1, 4, 469042) Real education has to draw out the best from the boys and girls to be educated.
('62', 242, 1, 5, 469122) This can never be done by packing ill assorted and unwanted information into the heads of the pupils.
('62', 242, 1, 6, 469224) It becomes a dead weight crushing all originality in them and turning them into mere automata.
('62', 242, 1, 7, 469319) If we were not ourselves victims of the system, we would long ago have realized the mischief wrought by the modern method of giving mass education, especially in a case like Indias.
('62', 242, 1, 8, 469501) Attempts have undoubtedly been made by many institutions to produce their own textbooks with more or less success.
('62', 242, 1, 9, 469616) But in my opinion they do not answer the vital needs of the country.
('62', 242, 1, 10, 469685) I lay no claim to originality for the views I have endeavoured to set forth here.
('62', 242, 1, 11, 469767) They are repeated here for the benefit of the managers and teachers of Harijan schools, who have a tremendous task before them.
('62', 242, 1, 12, 469895) They dare not be satisfied with mere mechanical work resulting in simply making the children under their charge indifferently and in a parrotlike manner learn the books chosen anyhow.
('62', 242, 1, 13, 470079) They have undertaken a great trust wich they must discharge courageously, intelligently and honestly.
('62', 242, 1, 14, 470181) The task is difficult enough but not so difficult as one would imagine, provided the teacher or the manager puts his whole heart into the work.
('62', 242, 1, 15, 470325) If he becomes a parent to his pupils, he will instinctively know what they need and set about giving it to them.
('62', 242, 1, 16, 470438) If he has it not to give, he will proceed to qualify himself.
('62', 242, 1, 17, 470500) And seeing that we have started with the idea that the boys and girls have to have instruction in accordance with their wants, no extraordinary cleverness or possession of external knowledge is required in a teacher of Harijan and, for that matter, any other children.
('62', 242, 1, 18, 470769) And when it is remembered that the primary aim of all education is, or should be, the moulding of the character of pupils, a teacher who has a character to keep need not lose heart.

('62', 242, 3, 21, 470987) A Harijan servant in Orissa gives me a graphic description of his visit to some Harijan quarters in Balasore District, near Bhadrak : 1
('62', 242, 4, 22, 471123) 1 The letter is not reproduced here.
('62', 242, 4, 23, 471160) The correspondent, describing the waterlogged, stinking Harijan quarters and referring to the article Another Plague
('62', 243, 0, 1, 471277) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 244
('62', 243, 1, 2, 471319) Is it any wonder that we have malaria, plague, and cholera rampant in our midst ?
('62', 243, 1, 3, 471401) It is impossible to avoid these diseases so long as we neglect these useful members of society, consign them to the dirtiest places and, because of the monster of untouchability, we would not teach them to do their work in a proper and efficient manner.
('62', 243, 1, 4, 471655) I suggest to workers all over the country that they must concentrate their effort upon the plague spots which they visit.
('62', 243, 1, 5, 471777) Let us not be baffled by the vastness of the problem.
('62', 243, 1, 6, 471831) Things will right themselves if everyone will attend to the work that comes his way.
('62', 243, 1, 7, 471916) I would, therefore, advise the workers of Bhadrak to go to the merchants, make out a simple plan of improvement, present them with a budget, level up the ground, put up plinths and rebuild the fifteen houses.
('62', 243, 1, 8, 472125) It cannot be a heavy budget and I doubt not that by sufficient importunity they will be able to raise a fund to reduce that plan to execution.
('62', 243, 1, 9, 472268) The donors will find that the donations are a sound investment in a health promoting project.
('62', 243, 1, 10, 472362) It would be like putting their courtyards in order.

('62', 243, 3, 13, 472464) ITARSI, December 1, 1933
('62', 243, 4, 14, 472489) BHAISHRI VALLABHBHAI, I am writing this letter at 3.15 a.m.
('62', 243, 4, 15, 472549) in a dharmashala at Itarsi.
('62', 243, 4, 16, 472577) Mirabehn has gone to wash her face.
('62', 243, 4, 17, 472613) After that we will pray, and then leave immediately to catch the train to Kareli, from where we have to go to Anantpur.
('62', 243, 4, 18, 472733) Jethalal 1 is working there.
('62', 243, 4, 19, 472762) Yesterday we were at Betul, and from there we came here by train, held a meeting and slept in this dharmashala.
('62', 243, 4, 20, 472874) I got your letter.
('62', 243, 4, 21, 472893) How much can we do to counter what is being done by The Times of India ?
('62', 243, 4, 22, 472966) Still I go on doing what I can think of.
('62', 243, 4, 23, 473007) I get very few opportunities to read newspapers these days.
('62', 243, 4, 24, 473067) I feel that the Harijan work is being indeed watched by Hari.
('62', 243, 4, 25, 473129) The power that draws hundreds of thousands of people at every place [that we visit] will also expose the lies.
('62', 243, 4, 26, 473240) If we remain careful enough and make no mistakes, we shall have done our duty.
('62', 243, 5, 27, 473319) Spot (vide p.

('62', 244, 1, 2, 473551) I know very well that your spirit is following me in my tour.
('62', 244, 1, 3, 473613) How do you know it is not protecting me ?
('62', 244, 1, 4, 473655) Didnt I see every moment in Yeravda that you feel a mothers love for me ?
('62', 244, 1, 5, 473729) The same love is visible in every line of your letters.
('62', 244, 1, 6, 473785) And it is allembracing.
('62', 244, 1, 7, 473809) That is why you are carefully watching every day from there.
('62', 244, 1, 8, 473870) Please dont worry about me, nor about what is happening in the country.
('62', 244, 1, 9, 473942) This is Gods work.
('62', 244, 1, 10, 473961) Who can repair what has gone amiss, O Lord ? We are in the train now.
('62', 244, 1, 11, 474031) I take it that you will do whatever may be necessary regarding your nose.

('62', 244, 5, 17, 474322) I was greatly pleased to learn that Harijans who observe rules of cleanliness are also admitted.

('62', 244, 10, 22, 474546) AMALA, I have your letter.
('62', 244, 10, 23, 474573) I call it good because it is truthful.
('62', 244, 10, 24, 474612) I knew you were deceiving yourself and me.
('62', 244, 10, 25, 474655) Will you now tell me what your nature demands?
('62', 244, 10, 26, 474702) If it demands simply being in my presence, it cannot be satisfied.
('62', 244, 10, 27, 474769) If it demands more teaching work and a life natural to most Europeans, I shall try to help you with hope of success.
('62', 244, 10, 28, 474886) You should confer with Jamnalalji when he returns.
('62', 244, 10, 29, 474937) Meanwhile do so with Dwarakanathji.
('62', 244, 10, 30, 474973) You ought to be steady and brave.
('62', 244, 10, 31, 475007) To desire to die is cowardice.
('62', 244, 10, 32, 475038) There is nobody about you who has any wish to repress you.
('62', 244, 10, 33, 475097) You have built in front of you a mountain of difficulties.
('62', 244, 10, 34, 475156) Make your choice resolutely and act.
('62', 244, 10, 35, 475193) It is nearing 3.30 a.m.

('62', 245, 5, 7, 475472) December 2, 1933
('62', 245, 6, 8, 475489) SURENDRA, I have your letter.
('62', 245, 6, 9, 475519) Yes, for the present you may build up your health.
('62', 245, 6, 10, 475570) You may go after Jamnalalji returns from the hill station.
('62', 245, 6, 11, 475629) There is no doubt that just now there is no other duty for us except that of serving the Harijans and going to jail.
('62', 245, 6, 12, 475746) Even in respect of these two I see that very few would now remain who would choose the second course.
('62', 245, 6, 13, 475848) Hardships in jails are likely to increase now.
('62', 245, 6, 14, 475895) Life in jails requires the utmost degree of physical and psychological tapascharya.
('62', 245, 6, 15, 475979) Only a handful of us, therefore, would be ready for jail going now.
('62', 245, 6, 16, 476047) Those who do not understand the religious meaning of suffering in jail have no place in jail at all.
('62', 245, 6, 17, 476148) There is no escape from undertaking fasts unto death.
('62', 245, 6, 18, 476202) Whether it comes today or tomorrow is another question.
('62', 245, 6, 19, 476258) The above portion was written at three sittings.
('62', 245, 6, 20, 476307) This is the fourth.
('62', 245, 6, 21, 476327) It is 3.30 in the morning.
('62', 245, 6, 22, 476354) I am with Jethalal in his Ashram at Anantpur.
('62', 245, 6, 23, 476400) The solitude of the hour is perfect.
('62', 245, 6, 24, 476437) Mirabehn and Om are sleeping on one side.
('62', 245, 6, 25, 476479) There is no sound except of their breathing.
('62', 245, 6, 26, 476524) Now to resume the question of the fasts.
('62', 245, 6, 27, 476565) They, too, will come by and by.
('62', 245, 6, 28, 476597) They will commence when we are fit for them.
('62', 245, 6, 29, 476642) Today foolish people are freely using this most effective weapon, but everywhere I hear stories about their fasts.
('62', 245, 6, 30, 476757) Fortunately, few people can remain hungry for a long time.
('62', 245, 6, 31, 476816) Hence the number of those who merely copy the example of others is insignificant.
('62', 245, 6, 32, 476898) But their cases demonstrate that when used without ones being qualified for it the weapon has no value at all.
('62', 245, 6, 33, 477009) It is such a wonder weapon that it can never do harm.
('62', 245, 6, 34, 477063) When an unqualified person resorts to it, it will harm his health a little that is all.
('62', 245, 6, 35, 477151) Such people cannot even prolong their fast to the point of death.
('62', 245, 6, 36, 477217) My purpose in writing all this you is that we have nothing to think or do except cultivating fitness.
('62', 245, 6, 37, 477319) We should not even wish that the fasts
('62', 246, 0, 1, 477358) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 247
('62', 246, 1, 2, 477405) should commence.
('62', 246, 1, 3, 477422) We should be ready, that is all.
('62', 246, 1, 4, 477455) While I am alive, no one else need on his own resort to a fast for the service of the Harij ansor in connection with satyagraha for any other object.
('62', 246, 1, 5, 477605) Tell Durbari 1 that he can write whenever he wants.
('62', 246, 1, 6, 477657) He need have no hesi tation at all.
('62', 246, 1, 7, 477693) If he throws himself into service heart and soul, many of the difficulties will solve themselves.
('62', 246, 1, 8, 477791) How do you use your time these days?
('62', 246, 1, 9, 477828) What is your diet?
('62', 246, 1, 10, 477847) You must drink milk and eat ghee as you need to build up your helth.
('62', 246, 1, 11, 477916) Do not count the cost.
('62', 246, 1, 12, 477939) They will be easily available.
('62', 246, 1, 13, 477970) Therefore accept them.
('62', 246, 1, 14, 477993) If we do not get them, we should not feel disappointed.
('62', 246, 1, 15, 478049) But when they are available, we should regard it our duty to accept them.
('62', 246, 1, 16, 478123) When you have cultivated indifference to taste, it is unnecessary to feel hesitant in such matter.
('62', 246, 1, 17, 478222) If you do not get either of the two things in jail, are you not going to do without them?
('62', 246, 1, 18, 478312) He whose understanding is secure, who is undeluded, who knows Brahman and who rests in Brahman, will neither be glad to get what is pleasant, nor sad to get what is unpleasant. 2 The body has been rightly compared to Chintamani.
('62', 246, 1, 19, 478541) If we look upon it as an instrument [of service] given by God, we are duty bound to take proper care of the God given instru ment.
('62', 246, 1, 20, 478672) Even in jail you should not hesitate to inform the authorities about your physical condition.
('62', 246, 1, 21, 478766) After thus taking the necessary steps for the protection of the body, we may sing, Let this body perish or survive. It is now four oclock and the others have got up.
('62', 246, 1, 22, 478932) Prepara tions have started for the prayer and so I must stop.

('62', 247, 6, 10, 479823) December 2, 1933 It is a good omen to me and to my cause and service of Harijans that such a big rush of people has come for me.
('62', 247, 6, 11, 479952) I believe that they really want to drive out this curse of untouchability from the Hindu society.
('62', 247, 6, 12, 480050) All are equal in the eyes of God and they have equal right to use public wells, schools and temples.
('62', 247, 6, 13, 480151) The present movement is directed towards selfpurification and one should not think oneself high or low in ones estimation.
('62', 247, 6, 14, 480274) The form in which untouchability is practised in India is to be found in no other country and it does not find support in the code of Manu.
('62', 247, 6, 15, 480414) I am not an atheist.
('62', 247, 6, 16, 480435) I have fifty years of experience and have not observed such distinction.
('62', 247, 7, 17, 480508) Replying to a long letter received from sanatanists, he said he had not practised adharma.
('62', 247, 7, 18, 480599) If he did so he would be guilty in the eyes of God and man alike.
('62', 247, 7, 19, 480665) Even if I am left alone, I will preach this very thing.
('62', 247, 8, 20, 480721) Continuing, he advised the audience not to insult or injure the sanatanists but
('62', 247, 9, 21, 480801) to love them as a mother loves her child.
('62', 247, 9, 22, 480843) He firmly believed that a day would soon
('62', 247, 10, 23, 480884) come when the sanatanists also would be with him.
('62', 247, 11, 24, 480934) Turning to the Harijans, he advised them to cultivate habits of cleanliness and
('62', 247, 12, 25, 481014) give up carrioneating and to abstain from drink.
('62', 247, 12, 26, 481063) He dwelt on the efficacy of prayer
('62', 247, 13, 27, 481098) and advised the Harijans to pray every morning in Hindi, because no knowledge of
('62', 247, 14, 28, 481179) Sanskrit was necessary for prayer.
('62', 247, 14, 29, 481214) He recalled his own 50 years experience and
('62', 247, 15, 30, 481258) showed how God had relieved him in moments of difficulties.
('62', 247, 15, 31, 481318) While going to the
('62', 247, 16, 32, 481337) temples they should go after a bath and in clean dress.

('62', 248, 1, 2, 481470) 270. SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, JABALPUR
('62', 248, 2, 3, 481510) December 3, 1933 If this effort to abolish root and branch the distinctions of high and low succeeds, it will have a healthy reaction on all spheres of life, and the struggle between capital and labour will cease and give place to cooperation and concord between the two.
('62', 248, 2, 4, 481782) 1 If we have understood the full implications of this war against untouchability, we should have no difficulty in realizing that untouchability based on birth is only one of the countless phases of that curse.
('62', 248, 2, 5, 481992) We should thus be better serving the cause of freedom and communal unity that I have at heart.
('62', 248, 2, 6, 482087) My faith in the movement has grown from day to day.
('62', 248, 2, 7, 482139) I implicitly believe that, if we succeed in abolishing untouchability from Hinduism, all the quarrels between classes and communities that we see today in India will cease.
('62', 248, 2, 8, 482312) The differences between Hindus and Mussalmans and between capital and labour will be composed.
('62', 248, 2, 9, 482407) Once the hearts are purified, it will be found easy to overcome all difficulties in the way of a heart unity.
('62', 248, 2, 10, 482517) The phase we are at present dealing with does not exhaust all the possibilities of the struggle.
('62', 248, 2, 11, 482614) The untouchability as practised today in Hinduism is the worst of all the phases.
('62', 248, 2, 12, 482696) Masquerading under the name of religion, it has contributed most to the degradation of man by man.
('62', 248, 2, 13, 482795) I have said that untou chability is a manyheaded monster and appears in many shapes and forms, some of them so subtle as not to be easily detected.
('62', 248, 2, 14, 482943) There are many degrees in untouchability.
('62', 248, 2, 15, 482985) I was conscious of all these im plications when I took up this war and made up my mind to devote my full energy, in the evening of my life, to this work.
('62', 248, 2, 16, 483139) All true scouts have my blessings.
('62', 248, 2, 17, 483174) 2 In my many wanderings over many parts of the world, I have come in contact with thousands of boy scouts.
('62', 248, 2, 18, 483281) True scouts are brave, considerate, courteous, and intelligent.
('62', 248, 2, 19, 483345) They should have a full sense of their duty.
('62', 248, 2, 20, 483390) They have been working to preserve order at the numerous fairs in the country where millions gather.
('62', 248, 2, 21, 483491) I would also like them to give a part of their time to the service of the Harijans.
('62', 248, 2, 22, 483575) Anyone who sees Harijan quarters with my eye will be convinced that there is ample scope for service for all who have the will and the capacity to do it.
('62', 248, 2, 23, 483729) It does not require extraordinary intelligence.
('62', 248, 2, 24, 483777) The only thing required is a sense of identification with the Harijans.
('62', 248, 3, 25, 483849) 1 In an address presented by the local labour union, it was asked why Gandhiji did not work for ameliorating the condition of labourers and protecting them against exploitation by capitalists.
('62', 248, 3, 26, 484042) 2 The National Boy Scouts had presented an address to Gandhiji.

('62', 249, 1, 2, 484148) There is no end of difficulties in the way, but there is not a single difficulty for which there is no remedy.
('62', 249, 1, 3, 484259) The beauty of a religious movement lies in the fact that all difficulties blocking its progress are automatically solved.
('62', 249, 1, 4, 484381) God himself clears the way.
('62', 249, 1, 5, 484409) His is the guiding hand, we are but His instruments.
('62', 249, 1, 6, 484462) If we gird up our loins to fight this age old sin against God and man and observe fully the conditions laid down by Shastras and followed by sages of old and humbly seek Divine aid in our undertaking, we are sure to win the grace of God.
('62', 249, 1, 7, 484700) These conditions require a thorough observance of truth and non violence and the utmost sacrifices and sufferings.
('62', 249, 1, 8, 484815) If we have all that and, above all, charity and goodwill for our opponents, the difficulties, howsoever great, will surely melt away.

('62', 249, 10, 18, 485255) BHAISHRI VALLABHBHAI, We arrived at Jabalpur last evening.
('62', 249, 10, 19, 485314) It is 6.30 just now.
('62', 249, 10, 20, 485335) I got your letter yesterday in Katni.
('62', 249, 10, 21, 485373) I saw the work being done at Anantpur.
('62', 249, 10, 22, 485412) It is all solid, but for that very reason it is also slow.
('62', 249, 10, 23, 485471) Jethalal is an extremely efficient worker.
('62', 249, 10, 24, 485514) Gordhanbhai is very much displeased with my conduct.
('62', 249, 10, 25, 485567) I am of course trying to explain things to him.
('62', 249, 10, 26, 485615) His idea is to spend the money in foreign countries.
('62', 249, 10, 27, 485668) I have advised him against doing that.
('62', 249, 10, 28, 485707) He has not

('62', 250, 1, 2, 485765) consulted me yet regarding the will.
('62', 250, 1, 3, 485802) If he does, I will naturally remember what you have said in your letter.
('62', 250, 1, 4, 485875) The whole thing seems strange, but I wouldnt be surprised if what we hear were really true.
('62', 250, 1, 5, 485967) Whatever it is, the truth will come out in time.
('62', 250, 1, 6, 486016) The big guns are expected today.
('62', 250, 1, 7, 486049) I see that all will meet tomorrow.

('62', 250, 1, 11, 486164) Brijkrishna is on his death bed.
('62', 250, 1, 12, 486197) You know that during the fast he had looked after me with the utmost devotion.
('62', 250, 1, 13, 486276) I keep myself informed about his condition.
('62', 250, 1, 14, 486320) There is a wire from Dr. Ansari saying that there is a possibility that he may survive the crisis.
('62', 250, 1, 15, 486419) I learnt only from your letter that Mahadev had been given a companion 2. Joshi is keeping very well.
('62', 250, 1, 16, 486521) I heard about Ba only yesterday after we had arrived here.

('62', 252, 1, 2, 488388) 276. SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, MANDLA1
('62', 252, 2, 3, 488427) December 6, 1933 I have said that those who come to these gatherings as an appreciation of my political services and not because they believe in removal of untouchability deceive themselves and me.
('62', 252, 2, 4, 488625) I invite only sympathizers and opponents to these meetings, the latter if they wish to signify their opposition.
('62', 252, 2, 5, 488738) I want you to be true to yourselves and reject me if you do not see eye to eye with me in this matter.
('62', 252, 2, 6, 488841) There are two sets of pundits who give opposite interpretations of Shastras.
('62', 252, 2, 7, 488918) The layman then has to make use of his Godgiven reason and choose between the two.
('62', 252, 2, 8, 489001) 2 Untouchability, I have found, appeals neither to the intellect nor to the heart.
('62', 252, 2, 9, 489084) The essential urge of the heart is towards compassion and sympathy for the sinner.
('62', 252, 2, 10, 489167) Temples are meant for sinners, where they can wash away their sins.
('62', 252, 2, 11, 489235) What is the use of temples to a liberated sinless soul, who sees God everywhere ?
('62', 252, 2, 12, 489317) If you believe that Harijans are in their present plight today as a result of their past sins, you must concede that they have the first right of worship in temples.
('62', 252, 2, 13, 489483) God has been described by all the scriptures of the world as a Protector and Saviour of the sinner.
('62', 252, 2, 14, 489583) There is untouchability in the Shastras in a particular sense.
('62', 252, 2, 15, 489646) Anger, lust and other evil passions raging in the heart are the real untouchables.
('62', 252, 2, 16, 489729) It is a prostitution of Shastras to interpret them as sanctioning the distinctions we observe today.
('62', 252, 2, 17, 489830) A true man of piety will consider himself a sinner and, therefore, untouchable.
('62', 252, 2, 18, 489910) We in our haughtiness have hitherto misinterpreted the Shastras and have raised a sin to the status of a religious tenet.
('62', 252, 2, 19, 490032) I claim to be a true sanatanist, because I make the greatest effort I can to live up to the truth as I see it.
('62', 252, 2, 20, 490143) Diversity there certainly is in the world, but it means neither inequality nor untouchability.
('62', 252, 2, 21, 490238) An elephant and an ant are dissimilar.
('62', 252, 2, 22, 490277) Nevertheless God has said that they are equal in His eyes.
('62', 252, 2, 23, 490336) The inner
('62', 252, 3, 24, 490346) 1 Earlier, the meeting was addressed by a sanatanist Swami with Gandhijis permission.
('62', 252, 3, 25, 490432) The burden of his speech was that the large gatherings came to pay homage to Gandhiji as a political leader and not because they accepted his views on untouchability.
('62', 252, 3, 26, 490599) 2 In the address presented there was a reference to the debate between Shankara, the reformer, and Mandanmisra, the formalist, which took place in Mahishmati, the ancient seat of learning, now Mandla.

('62', 253, 1, 3, 490869) The forms are many, but the informing spirit, is one.
('62', 253, 1, 4, 490923) How can there be room for distinctions of high and low where there is this all embracing fundamental unity underlying the outward diversity?
('62', 253, 1, 5, 491064) For that is a fact meeting you at every step in daily life.

('62', 253, 5, 14, 491514) Trust my life to God.
('62', 253, 5, 15, 491536) Can there be any better protector than He?

('62', 253, 5, 18, 491663) Generally I accept them, but sometimes I refuse.
('62', 253, 5, 19, 491712) My personal needs are looked after by Mirabehn and Om.
('62', 253, 5, 20, 491767) Mirabehn has only one thought day and night.
('62', 253, 5, 21, 491812) She doesnt attend any meeting, but spends all her time in keeping things ready for me.
('62', 253, 5, 22, 491899) She keeps well.
('62', 253, 5, 23, 491915) I had got cold but I am better now.

('62', 254, 16, 25, 493623) BHAISHRI VALLABHBHAI, I had a very long letter from Gordhanbhai which of course I didnt preserve.
('62', 254, 16, 26, 493721) He had pointed out in it all my shortcomings and contrasted them with Vithalbhais virtues.
('62', 254, 16, 27, 493812) I had returned a very loving reply to that letter.
('62', 254, 16, 28, 493863) I have received no acknowledgment.

('62', 255, 1, 3, 494015) I told Mathuradas in reply that I would not let it be used in foreign countries.
('62', 255, 1, 4, 494096) You must have seen that he has now made a public appeal to me.
('62', 255, 1, 5, 494159) We shall know the whole truth by and by.
('62', 255, 1, 6, 494200) I hope to be able to manage the situation well enough.
('62', 255, 1, 7, 494255) You neednt worry.

('62', 255, 1, 12, 494439) It was not his fault at all.
('62', 255, 1, 13, 494468) He tries hard indeed to save me from all inconvenience.
('62', 255, 1, 14, 494524) He doesnt let any troublesome people come near me.
('62', 255, 1, 15, 494575) He saves me from a great many things, but sometimes he is helpless.
('62', 255, 1, 16, 494643) I am sure we shall learn from experience and things will keep improving.
('62', 255, 1, 17, 494716) Dont worry about this either.
('62', 255, 1, 18, 494746) Gods will be done. Kishorelal is ill.
('62', 255, 1, 19, 494784) He is a little better now.
('62', 255, 1, 20, 494811) He is in Bombay.
('62', 255, 1, 21, 494828) Write to him.
('62', 255, 1, 22, 494842) Jivrajs 2 health seems to have been affected very much.
('62', 255, 1, 23, 494898) He is in Hotel Rugby in Matheran.
('62', 255, 1, 24, 494932) Mathuradas was in the crowd.
('62', 255, 1, 25, 494961) 3 He is still with me.
('62', 255, 1, 26, 494984) He will remain with me up to Delhi.
('62', 255, 1, 27, 495020) His health also seems to have been affected.
('62', 255, 1, 28, 495065) He suffers from backache.
('62', 255, 1, 29, 495091) He cannot move freely.
('62', 255, 1, 30, 495114) If he takes rest I think he will regain strength.
('62', 255, 1, 31, 495164) It may be said that, at the meeting, they talked a little and then left.
('62', 255, 1, 32, 495237) Maulana Saheb and the Doctor tried to persuade me not to be uncompromising.
('62', 255, 1, 33, 495313) On my explaining my conflict of duties, they became silent.
('62', 255, 1, 34, 495373) The matter was discussed in minute detail.
('62', 255, 1, 35, 495416) I felt that Nariman had no sense.
('62', 255, 1, 36, 495450) I told them:If somebody writes Whither India ? and another writes Whither Congress ?, I hope it wouldnt seem too much if I write Whither Nariman ?. Jawahar is indeed a jawahar 4. About Jamnalalji I neednt write anything.
('62', 255, 1, 37, 495671) He has put on weight.
('62', 255, 1, 38, 495693) His health is all right, more or less.
('62', 255, 1, 39, 495732) Chikhalda benefited him very much.
('62', 255, 1, 40, 495767) The condition of his ear is as bad as that of your nose.
('62', 255, 1, 41, 495824) One is without nose, and the other is deaf.
('62', 255, 1, 42, 495868) To whom may I complain about these difficulties ?
('62', 255, 1, 43, 495918) Please let me know, however, if the injections help you now.
('62', 255, 1, 44, 495979) I like your idea of trying neti 5But who will

('62', 256, 1, 4, 496458) Can I not be called there as one ?
('62', 256, 1, 5, 496493) If you dont know the correct way there may be a little bleeding.
('62', 256, 1, 6, 496558) Generally a straw is used in the beginning.
('62', 256, 1, 7, 496602) I would advise you not to do so.
('62', 256, 1, 8, 496635) Fine cloth will suffice.
('62', 256, 1, 9, 496660) If you do it slowly, there will be no difficulty.
('62', 256, 1, 10, 496710) Krishanadas 1Mahadev and Devdas were taught by me.
('62', 256, 1, 11, 496761) Devdas used to bleed, but the reason for that was different.
('62', 256, 1, 12, 496822) He had, therefore, to give up the practice.
('62', 256, 1, 13, 496866) Janakibehn had accompanied Jamnalal.
('62', 256, 1, 14, 496903) The two left last evening.
('62', 256, 1, 15, 496930) I learnt only from you that Giridhari was placed with Mahadev.

('62', 256, 2, 20, 497087) He has come here to see me.
('62', 256, 2, 21, 497115) He will leave for Karadi today.
('62', 256, 2, 22, 497147) He is all right.
('62', 256, 2, 23, 497164) Chandrashankar is doing full justice to his work.
('62', 256, 2, 24, 497214) Kaka and Swami have gone to Matheran for four or five days.
('62', 256, 2, 25, 497274) I will reach Delhi on the 10th.

('62', 256, 9, 31, 497440) SURENDRA, I have your letter.
('62', 256, 9, 32, 497470) We live but for a moment, and live with our labour or at any rate ought to do so.
('62', 256, 9, 33, 497552) Only so shall we become fully alive.
('62', 256, 9, 34, 497589) Do not be obsessed with the idea of the fast.
('62', 256, 9, 35, 497635) One must be ready for it and cultivate fitness for it, that is all.
('62', 256, 9, 36, 497703) I see no harm in both of you entering the temple 4 from there.
('62', 256, 9, 37, 497766) We have no money and should not have any.
('62', 256, 9, 38, 497808) For that reason it seems right to me that you should go [to jail] from there.

('62', 257, 1, 3, 498080) Madhavji wishes to go to Karadi.
('62', 257, 1, 4, 498113) I approve.
('62', 257, 1, 5, 498124) He is not at Wardha.
('62', 257, 1, 6, 498145) He has to choose his field of work, and therefore can choose only Karadi.
('62', 257, 1, 7, 498219) Moreover, it seems but proper that one of you three should go [to jail] from there.
('62', 257, 1, 8, 498303) Since Madhavji has money, let him go from Karadi.

('62', 257, 3, 12, 498520) Personally I like the idea of wearing the sacred thread and vest.
('62', 257, 3, 13, 498586) From your point of view it certainly cannot have any religious significance.
('62', 257, 3, 14, 498663) But respecting harmless customs is also religion.
('62', 257, 3, 15, 498713) You should meet members of your family if you can do so without letting it interfere in any way with your mission of service.
('62', 257, 3, 16, 498839) Serving any of them individually is now outside your field of duty.
('62', 257, 3, 17, 498907) However, it is not proper for me to confuse your thinking.
('62', 257, 3, 18, 498966) Your dharma lies in what Surendra advises.
('62', 257, 3, 19, 499009) He alone will save you.
('62', 257, 3, 20, 499033) However, you will have to give up the desire of living even with him.
('62', 257, 3, 21, 499103) It is not at all likely that you will be together in jail.
('62', 257, 3, 22, 499162) Of course it would be good if that happened of its own.
('62', 257, 3, 23, 499218) I am glad that your health has improved.

('62', 257, 7, 29, 499430) When I advised you to give up inhibition 1 I meant that you should not hesitate to take what help you need from other brothers and sisters.
('62', 257, 7, 30, 499570) One can get such help through heart felt humility.

('62', 258, 6, 12, 500239) JABALPUR, December 7, 1933 I, who believe in the equality of the great religions of the world and from my early days have learnt to honour other re ligions as my own, have no difficulty in inviting and taking the co operation to the followers of other religions in this movement.
('62', 258, 6, 13, 500519) It is part of my nature.
('62', 258, 6, 14, 500544) This is essentially a matter of repentance on the part of the so called higher classes.
('62', 258, 6, 15, 500632) They have to do re paration for the wrongs they have hitherto done to a portion of themselves on whose backs they have hitherto ridden.
('62', 258, 6, 16, 500768) It is an effort on the part of Hindu reformers to blot out this shame from the face of Hinduism.
('62', 258, 6, 17, 500865) I have not hesitated to say that either untouchability lives and Hinduism perishes, or untou chability goes and Hinduism rises purified.
('62', 258, 6, 18, 501002) It is a life and death struggle bet ween the darkness of superstition and the light of reform.
('62', 258, 6, 19, 501097) If this reform in Hinduism comes about, I have not the shadow of a doubt that it will be a service not only of all the communities of India but of the whole of humanity.
('62', 258, 6, 20, 501267) I am not thinking of achieving this reform by any form of compulsion, including legal.
('62', 258, 6, 21, 501354) It is said that, in trying to seek support for the two Bills now before the Assembly, I am really supporting a policy of legal compulsion.
('62', 258, 6, 22, 501493) I do not want to repeat here the whole argument against that contention; but I want to assure you that there is no compulsion in the Bills; and those who care to study them will endorse my opinion.
('62', 258, 6, 23, 501691) This must be a reform from within.
('62', 258, 6, 24, 501726) It is not a political movement.
('62', 258, 6, 25, 501758) I do not want to deny that it will have great political results, but I have never for a moment thought of achieving through this movement the political rise of the so called upper class Hindus.
('62', 258, 6, 26, 501952) It is to my mind a movement of downright purification.
('62', 259, 0, 1, 502007) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 260
('62', 259, 1, 2, 502049) Having made these introductory remarks, it is easy for me to tell you on what terms you can give your assistance to the movement.
('62', 259, 1, 3, 502179) You should work in co operation with and, if I may say it, in subordination to the Society that has been formed for suppression and eradication of untouchability, namely, the Servants of Untouchables Society.
('62', 259, 1, 4, 502388) That is to say, you should put your talents at the disposal of the Society.
('62', 259, 1, 5, 502464) I do not mean metallic talents.
('62', 259, 1, 6, 502496) These have to come from those who have to make repentance and reparation.
('62', 259, 1, 7, 502570) I have seen during the few days of my tour that millions are ready for the reform.
('62', 259, 1, 8, 502653) They can tangibly signify their support only by giving their coppers.
('62', 259, 1, 9, 502723) But men and women of intelligence are wanted to work for the Harijans in a variety of ways.
('62', 259, 1, 10, 502815) For the so called caste Hindus to serve the Harijans in a constructive manner is to get off their backs, to go down on their knees to them, to treat Harijan children as their own and Harijan men and women as blood brothers and sisters.
('62', 259, 1, 11, 503051) It is almost a superhuman task and cannot be done without Divine aid.
('62', 259, 1, 12, 503121) But Divine aid comes largely through human agency.
('62', 259, 1, 13, 503172) I confess that we have too few teachers and other professional men and women in our ranks.
('62', 259, 1, 14, 503263) We want to cope with the ever increasing demand.
('62', 259, 1, 15, 503312) I invite the aid of agencies like yours in this work.
('62', 259, 1, 16, 503366) You will now understand what I mean by subordination.
('62', 259, 1, 17, 503420) This is the right way.
('62', 259, 1, 18, 503443) But there is also the wrong way.
('62', 259, 1, 19, 503476) You may choose to work independently.
('62', 259, 1, 20, 503514) You may have the conversion of Harijans to Christianity.
('62', 259, 1, 21, 503571) You may see in the movement a chance for propaganda.
('62', 259, 1, 22, 503624) If you work among the Harijans with such an aim, you can see that the very end we have in view will be frustrated.
('62', 259, 1, 23, 503739) If you believe that Hinduism is a gift, not of God but of Satan, quite clearly you cannot accept my terms.
('62', 259, 1, 24, 503846) You and I would be dishonest if we did not make clear to one another what we stand for.

('62', 263, 4, 11, 508545) 293. SPEECH AT LABOURERS MEETING 1
('62', 263, 5, 12, 508580) DELHI, December 10, 1933
('62', 263, 6, 13, 508605) [Gandhiji] congratulated the organizers of his programme on the happy
('62', 263, 7, 14, 508675) beginning made with a visit to Harijan quarters and followed by the labourers
('62', 263, 8, 15, 508753) meeting.
('62', 263, 9, 16, 508762) Thanking them for the purse, the Mahatma said he knew that half the amount in the purse was contributed by the employer (Mr. G. D. Birla) and half by the labourers from the Labour Welfare Fund.
('62', 263, 9, 17, 508956) To present such a big sum was the work of rich persons and not of labourers, and besides this, most of them were Harijans and it did not behove him to take money from them to remove the curse of untouchability.
('62', 263, 9, 18, 509167) It was the duty of high caste Hindus like Mr. Birla to contribute money to wipe out untouchability,and he hesitated to accept money from Harijans, but all the same he accepted it, since they voulnteered it, but, added the Mahatma, he would have preferred it if the Harijans had given up liquor or smoking and contributed those savings for Harijan work.
('62', 263, 9, 19, 509520) The money thus contributed would have been more helpful in the noble mission.
('62', 263, 9, 20, 509598) He recalled, in this connection, the contribution raised by Bhopal students yesterday by raising a pie fund.
('62', 263, 10, 21, 509707) Continuing, the Mahatma said the Hindus, in patronizing the Harijan movement, were really doing a penance (prayashchitta) for their age long sins, and this penance must be sincere.
('62', 263, 10, 22, 509888) If they failed to do it, God alone knew what their fate would be.
('62', 263, 11, 23, 509954) 1 About 5,000 labourers and others attended the meeting held in the Birla Mills.
('62', 263, 11, 24, 510035) A purse of Rs. 2,000 and an address on a banana leaf were presented to Gandhiji.
('62', 263, 11, 25, 510116) He remarked : The idea of presenting the address on a banana leaf is very good, but you should have given me some fruit to eat. Soon after a basket of fruit was brought.
('62', 264, 0, 1, 510286) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 265
('62', 264, 1, 2, 510333) Referring to the Harijan reform work done in the Birla Mills, Mahatmaji said : It is no news to me that you have wiped out untouchability in the Birla Mills.
('62', 264, 1, 3, 510491) Ghanshyamdasji has merely paid the debt that he owed as a high caste Hindu to the Harijans and as a millowner to labourers.
('62', 264, 2, 4, 510615) It was the religious duty of every Hindu, be he a mill owner or poor man, to root out untouchability from this land.
('62', 264, 2, 5, 510732) In doing so, they were merely doing their duty and did not deserve any thanks.
('62', 264, 3, 6, 510811) Continuing, the Mahatma sounded a note of warning in the following words : Wipe out untouchability or Hinduism will be wiped out from the world.
('62', 264, 4, 7, 510956) Referring to some sanatanists, who did not agree with him in this reform movement, Mahatmaji said : I have tried my best to persuade sanatanists to my view and have given my best attention to their arguments, but they have failed to convince me by a single proof from the Shastras giving sanction to untouchability.
('62', 264, 5, 8, 511272) Continuing, the Mahatma appealed to the labourers to give up liquor, smoking and other evil practices and lead a pure life internally as well as externally.
('62', 264, 5, 9, 511429) He laid stress on Gods worship and added that faith in God alone could put an end to their sorrows.
('62', 264, 5, 10, 511529) He concluded with a prayer for the welfare of labourers, saying that he also regarded himself as a labourer by choice.
('62', 264, 5, 11, 511648) It was better to be a labourer than to be an employer.
('62', 264, 5, 12, 511703) (Cheers)
('62', 264, 6, 13, 511712) The Mahatma humorously remarked : I feel very much tempted to finish the fruit, but give it to Harijan children and they will reach me.

('62', 264, 9, 16, 511910) DELHI, December 10, 1933
('62', 264, 10, 17, 511935) Q. Do you consider temple entry as the only way to solve our troubles ?
('62', 264, 10, 18, 512007) A. It is my firm belief that caste Hindus will not have fulfilled their obligations till they have opened all their temples to Harijans.
('62', 264, 10, 19, 512144) It is immaterial to me whether Harijans come to worship in those temples or not.
('62', 264, 10, 20, 512225) It is a matter of sheer justice and penance for caste Hindus.
('62', 264, 10, 21, 512287) It is repugnant to my sense of justice that Harijans should be excluded
('62', 265, 0, 1, 512359) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 266
('62', 265, 1, 2, 512401) from places of worship which are open to other Hindus.
('62', 265, 1, 3, 512456) I would not consider untouchability as having been eradicated, unless and until the bar against Harijans entry into temples is removed altogether.
('62', 265, 2, 4, 512603) Q. Will you not help us in our economic distress ?
('62', 265, 2, 5, 512654) To us economic uplift is the
('62', 265, 3, 6, 512683) chief thing.
('62', 265, 3, 7, 512696) A. The economic uplift has not been overlooked.
('62', 265, 3, 8, 512744) But I should not be satisfied if you were given crores of rupees and yet were still considered untouchables, or if palaces were built for you and you were still kept out of the pale of Hindu society.
('62', 265, 3, 9, 512944) I should be satisfied only when you are put on a par with caste Hindus in every respect.
('62', 265, 3, 10, 513033) Thus economic uplift is only one of the many items in our pro gramme.
('62', 265, 4, 11, 513103) Q. We should not conceal from you our misgivings about the money collected
('62', 265, 5, 12, 513178) by you being properly used for our welfare.
('62', 265, 5, 13, 513222) It depends upon your getting honest
('62', 265, 6, 14, 513258) workers to work out the scheme, of whom there are very few at present.
('62', 265, 6, 15, 513329) Would you not
('62', 265, 7, 16, 513343) then put the funds into our hands to be used according to our discretion ?
('62', 265, 7, 17, 513418) We must tell
('62', 265, 8, 18, 513431) you frankly we do not trust the present workers.
('62', 265, 8, 19, 513480) A. I do not mean to say that no Harijans can take part in the disbursement of the funds.
('62', 265, 8, 20, 513569) But as the whole reform is conceived as a matter of penance and reparation on the part of caste Hindus, they have to find the best way of using them.
('62', 265, 8, 21, 513719) They must be guided by the advice of Harijans, but the actual administration of the funds has to rest with them.
('62', 265, 8, 22, 513832) I may assure you that the least part of these funds will be spent for propaganda.
('62', 265, 8, 23, 513914) By far the greater part will go directly into the pockets of Harijans.
('62', 265, 8, 24, 513985) I have no reason to believe that all those who are doing Harijan service today are actuated by selfish motives.
('62', 265, 8, 25, 514097) There must be a few cases where workers are not as you and I would have them to be, but the majority have taken up this work in the proper spirit.
('62', 265, 8, 26, 514244) Many of them are of unimpeachable character and would do credit to any movement.
('62', 265, 8, 27, 514325) Apart from all this, however, I want you to visualize the conditions of thousands of Harijans who are so suppressed that they have fallen below the average standard of huma nity.
('62', 265, 8, 28, 514504) They are voiceless.
('62', 265, 8, 29, 514524) They consider themselves sub human.
('62', 265, 8, 30, 514560) In Orissa, some years back, 1 an old man came to me with a straw in his mouth.
('62', 265, 8, 31, 514639) I tried to awaken in him the sense that he was my equal as a human being.
('62', 265, 8, 32, 514713) Another Harijan came to me in Cochin all trembling
('62', 265, 9, 33, 514764) 1 In December 1927; vide ,Our Shame and their Shame
('62', 266, 0, 1, 514816) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 267
('62', 266, 1, 2, 514863) with fear.
('62', 266, 1, 3, 514874) He was considered invisible in those parts and was afraid of coming into the world of touchables.
('62', 266, 1, 4, 514972) These people are a standing reproach to us.
('62', 266, 1, 5, 515016) In the work I am doing, I have these in mind.
('62', 266, 1, 6, 515062) This service, then, has been taken up, not so much to please Harijans as to discharge a peremptory obligation.
('62', 266, 1, 7, 515173) We want to wipe out our shame and to die in that effort if need be.
('62', 266, 1, 8, 515241) We are striving to the best of our ability to render you selfless service, but if Harijans do not accept it, I shall know that we are too late.
('62', 266, 1, 9, 515385) But the months experience convinces me that the vast majority gladly accept this service.
('62', 266, 1, 10, 515475) We do not wish to leave a single phase of your life untouched.
('62', 266, 1, 11, 515538) We approach you as servants and not as patrons.
('62', 266, 2, 12, 515586) Q. You have only added a new name Harijan to the many names we already
('62', 266, 3, 13, 515657) Even this new name is significant of our separateness from the others.
('62', 266, 4, 14, 515728) this sense of separateness goes, in fact as well as in name, how are we to be satisfied ?
('62', 266, 4, 15, 515818) A. The name Harijan was suggested by one of your own class.
('62', 266, 4, 16, 515878) Thousands have welcomed the name as a good substitute for the offensive names untouchable and avarna.
('62', 266, 4, 17, 515980) So long as untoucha bility is not completely removed, a name to distinguish you from others will be required, and an inoffensive name is any day better than one that stinks in the nostrils.
('62', 266, 4, 18, 516170) When untouchability is gone and Harijans are merged into the Hindus, I do not know by what name Harijan or Hinduthe whole community will choose to call itself, but till that day comes, distinguishing names will have to be used.
('62', 266, 4, 19, 516398) You should know that I have become a Harijan by choice and am trying to serve you as one of yourselves; and I am sure that the sevice will, in the end, be accepted by all Harijans, if I have offered it in a selfless spirit.
('62', 266, 4, 20, 516622) I would plead with you for a little more patience to see what is being done.
('62', 266, 4, 21, 516699) The Harijan Sevak Sangh has no other end in view but your good.

('62', 266, 6, 23, 516783) 295. LETTER TO MANILAL AND SUSHILA GANDHI
('62', 266, 7, 24, 516825) DELHI, December 10, 1933
('62', 266, 8, 25, 516850) MANILAL AND SUSHILA, I got the letters of you both.
('62', 266, 8, 26, 516902) Which remarks of mine hurt so much ?
('62', 266, 8, 27, 516939) I dont remember what I said to Kishorelal, but I have never
('62', 267, 0, 1, 516999) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 268
('62', 267, 1, 2, 517041) thought you timid or cowardly.
('62', 267, 1, 3, 517072) On the contrary, I have always been proud of your courage.But I do think that you are too dependent on others, that you do not have sufficient capacity to think for yourself.
('62', 267, 1, 4, 517247) But that is not your fault.
('62', 267, 1, 5, 517275) Partly it may be mine.
('62', 267, 1, 6, 517298) You have nothing to feel ashamed about.
('62', 267, 1, 7, 517338) I wrote a long letter to you by the last mail, from which you will be able to know clearly my views in this regard.
('62', 267, 1, 8, 517454) Even your seeking my advice from here is a sign of your feeling of dependence.
('62', 267, 1, 9, 517533) If you make a mistake, I will not blame you even in my thoughts.
('62', 267, 1, 10, 517598) I would do that if you betrayed the trust reposed in you.
('62', 267, 1, 11, 517656) I do wish that you should keep the promises which you may have made to the people or to friends.
('62', 267, 1, 12, 517753) I am not at all afraid of your present course.
('62', 267, 1, 13, 517800) At the most the result would be your financial ruin.
('62', 267, 1, 14, 517853) Let it be so.
('62', 267, 1, 15, 517867) But dont let people think that you acted foolishly.
('62', 267, 1, 16, 517919) If you feel that you have made a mistake, admit it and free yourself.
('62', 267, 1, 17, 517989) It is not as easy for me to give advice in this matter as you seem to think.
('62', 267, 1, 18, 518066) If it were so, why wouldnt I advise you immediately ?
('62', 267, 1, 19, 518120) And now regarding your expenses.
('62', 267, 1, 20, 518153) My remarks were not meant as criticism nor did they express my pain.
('62', 267, 1, 21, 518222) I only wished to say that, having lived there in a certain manner, you could not easily change your mode of life here.
('62', 267, 1, 22, 518341) I dont wish that you should try our manner of life here at the cost of the health of all three of you.
('62', 267, 1, 23, 518444) You yourself have calculated your monthly requirement at Rs. 150. I have put it at Rs. 200. But now even Rs. 150 can be obtained only as a favour.
('62', 267, 1, 24, 518591) I would rather that you lived on plain fare than that you should depend on anybodys favour.
('62', 267, 1, 25, 518683) In short I am not satisfied with your way of life.
('62', 267, 1, 26, 518734) I know that Sushila is much more careful than you in this matter.
('62', 267, 1, 27, 518800) After reading your letters, I even felt like sending a cable to you asking you not to worry.
('62', 267, 1, 28, 518893) But with whose money would that have been ?
('62', 267, 1, 29, 518937) How can a poor father send a cable to reassure his son?
('62', 267, 1, 30, 518993) I, therefore, content myself with this letter.
('62', 267, 1, 31, 519040) Have no fear of me, either of you.
('62', 267, 1, 32, 519075) Live as both of you may think proper.
('62', 267, 1, 33, 519113) Even if you cannot continue to live there despite your sincere efforts and come over here, God will provide you means of livelihood.
('62', 267, 1, 34, 519246) Do whatever you do after independent thinking.
('62', 267, 1, 35, 519293) Nimu is pregnant again.
('62', 267, 1, 36, 519317) Ramdas feels extremely miserable.
('62', 267, 1, 37, 519351) I have tried to comfort him.
('62', 267, 1, 38, 519380) A man and a woman cannot succeed in this aim without hard effort.
('62', 267, 1, 39, 519446) But Ramdas is a weak man and thinks too much, so that even his weakness makes him unhappy.
('62', 268, 0, 1, 519537) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 269
('62', 268, 1, 2, 519584) Probably you know that Lakshmi also is pregnant.
('62', 268, 1, 3, 519633) I came to know these facts about both of them only recently.

('62', 268, 1, 5, 519749) Ba is happy in jail.

('62', 270, 6, 30, 523564) PRABHAVATI, I got your letter, as also Jayaprakashs.
('62', 270, 6, 31, 523617) If both of you come to a firm decision that you would dedicate yourselves to service, I shall have nothing to say.
('62', 270, 6, 32, 523732) I only explained to you both that it was not morally wrong to do ones duty towards ones own family, but that, if one wished to follow the path of service, one must renounce such private duties.
('62', 270, 7, 33, 523926) If you try to do both, you will probably fail in both.
('62', 270, 7, 34, 523981) There will be no difficulty in sending Rs. 50 every month for Rajeshwar.
('62', 270, 7, 35, 524054) 2 But that does not satisfy me.What arrangement have you made for your own expenses ?
('62', 270, 7, 36, 524140) What have you decided regarding the debt ?

('62', 271, 1, 3, 524384) But I will not dwell further on this matter.
('62', 271, 1, 4, 524429) I dont wish to discourage Jayaprakash.
('62', 271, 1, 5, 524468) We should hope that, since his motive is pure, everything will be all right.
('62', 271, 1, 6, 524545) You have not yet gone and seen Mother.
('62', 271, 1, 7, 524584) You should do so now.
('62', 271, 1, 8, 524606) Since your visit to me has been delayed so long, I shall now be far away.
('62', 271, 1, 9, 524680) If you do not wish to get arrested there, you may come and see me during my Andhra tour, and then from Wardha you may go wherever you like.
('62', 271, 1, 10, 524820) I think it would be best to go to Bihar.
('62', 271, 1, 11, 524861) If you decide to go to Bihar, it is not very necessary for you to come and see me.
('62', 271, 1, 12, 524944) If, however, you are very keen to come, by all means do come.
('62', 271, 1, 13, 525006) I leave it entirely to your own wish.
('62', 271, 1, 14, 525044) I shall be in Madras on 20, 21 and 22. I will start from here on the 14th.

('62', 271, 1, 18, 525291) Vidya felt bored and has come here.
('62', 271, 1, 19, 525327) She has brought Kanta with her.

('62', 271, 1, 21, 525448) Om has been with me.
('62', 271, 1, 22, 525469) I continue the same diet.
('62', 271, 1, 23, 525495) The quantity of milk varies from three pounds to one pound.
('62', 271, 1, 24, 525555) The cold which I had has gone.
('62', 271, 1, 25, 525586) The weight was 108 pounds when I was weighed in Jabalpur.
('62', 271, 1, 26, 525644) I have not been weighed after that.
('62', 271, 1, 27, 525680) You need not worry about me at all.
('62', 271, 1, 28, 525716) God will keep me in whatever condition.
('62', 271, 1, 29, 525756) He wishes and get work done through me as He wills.

('62', 273, 2, 3, 527653) DELHI, December 13, 1933 I claim to be a sanatanist as I consider my conduct to be in consonance with the spirit of the scriptures.
('62', 273, 2, 4, 527785) 1 You may, if you like, reject my claim.
('62', 273, 2, 5, 527826) I have studied the Shastras to the best of my ability and have arrived at the conclusion that untouchability is repugnant to the spirit of Hinduism.
('62', 273, 3, 6, 527975) They, however, contended that no one could be called sanatanist who did not believe in untouchability, shraddha, idol worship and other outward observances.
('62', 273, 4, 7, 528132) Gandhiji retorted that the only true test of sanatan dharma was the touchstone of truth.
('62', 273, 5, 8, 528221) He added that the outward observance was nothing if a man lived a crooked life.
('62', 273, 6, 9, 528301) did outward form avail to a man who was a drunkard, rake and gambler ?
('62', 273, 7, 10, 528372) When he was told that the attempt to have temples opened to Harijans was
('62', 273, 8, 11, 528445) bound to lead to bloodshed, he said that was practically impossible, as there was no
('62', 273, 9, 12, 528530) compulsion contemplated by anybody.
('62', 273, 9, 13, 528566) No temple was to be opened where the
('62', 273, 10, 14, 528603) overwhelming opinion of temple goers was not in favour of such opening.

('62', 273, 13, 17, 528733) December 13, 1933 I would ask you to believe me when I say that there is no political motive behind my Harijan work.
('62', 273, 13, 18, 528850) The political consequences of the removal of untouchability have no attraction for me.
('62', 273, 13, 19, 528937) Indeed, I believe that, if we approached this question with a political motive, we should fail to serve the Harijans and we should damage Hinduism.
('62', 273, 13, 20, 529085) That real removal of untouchability will have political consequences is true enough.
('62', 273, 13, 21, 529170) A duty religiously performed carries with it many other important consequences.
('62', 273, 13, 22, 529250) Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and everything else will be added unto you, is to my mind a scientific truth.
('62', 273, 13, 23, 529361) I must remind you of the pledge given last year in your name.
('62', 273, 14, 24, 529423) 1 The sanatanists had contended that Gandhiji had no right to call himself a sanatanist.
('62', 274, 0, 1, 529512) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 275
('62', 274, 1, 2, 529559) You will remember that a meeting of representatives of Hinduism was held in Bombay in September last year, Pandit Malaviyaji being in the chair.
('62', 274, 1, 3, 529704) Among other things they resolved that untouchability, being a blot on the Hindu religion, had to be removed and that Harijans were entitled to the same public utilities, and in the same manner, as caste Hindus.
('62', 274, 1, 4, 529915) There was in that Resolution a special reference to Hindu temples, and legislation was contemplated if it was found to be necessary for attaining the end.
('62', 274, 1, 5, 530070) It is, therefore, the bounden duty of every caste Hindu to fulfil the pledge by throwing open to the Harijans temples, well and other institutions precisely on the same terms as they are open to caste Hindus.

('62', 274, 4, 8, 530373) DELHI, December 13, 1933
('62', 274, 5, 9, 530398) Regarding the utilization of collections made during the tour Mahatma Gandhi
('62', 274, 6, 10, 530475) said that 75 percent of these collections would be spent in the locality concerned so
('62', 274, 7, 11, 530561) far as possible provided a suitable scheme was prepared and approved by the Central
('62', 274, 8, 12, 530645) The Provincial Boards should, however, not neglect their ordinary collections
('62', 274, 9, 13, 530723) in the hope of getting money out of his collections.
('62', 274, 9, 14, 530776) He stressed : You dare not utilize any part of these collections for propa ganda or office administration.
('62', 274, 9, 15, 530883) They can be utilized to the single pie for constructive work alone.
('62', 274, 9, 16, 530951) I am not touring India to finance your offices or to help your propaganda but to raise money enough for constructive work alone.
('62', 274, 9, 17, 531080) You should collect money separately to meet the expenses of your office administration.
('62', 274, 9, 18, 531168) If you do work out of the funds that I raise, the money paid by the public would be returned to them hundredfold.
('62', 274, 9, 19, 531282) It should, therefore, be zealously guarded and cautiously spent.
('62', 274, 10, 20, 531347) Asked as to what opinion he could express about the work done so far, Mahatma Gandhi replied : You cannot get any compliments if you want to get them.
('62', 274, 10, 21, 531498) But I can say that you could have done the work much better and as for the future I can only say that you should do better than in the past.
('62', 274, 11, 22, 531639) 1 Gandhiji had addressed the Central Board of the Society.
('62', 275, 0, 1, 531698) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 276
('62', 275, 1, 2, 531740) Regarding the question of democratization of the constitution of the Society, Mahatma Gandhi said that the present constitution should be worked democratically rather than bringing in a constitution demorcratic in form but autocratic in spirit.
('62', 275, 2, 3, 531985) His Holiness Garmuria Gosain of Assam and Mr. D. N. Sharma explained that ex tea garden coolies belonged to various provincess of India and were mostly Harijans.
('62', 275, 2, 4, 532147) Their population in Assam was 10,50,000 out of whom only 5,000 were literate.
('62', 275, 2, 5, 532225) They were commonly addicted to liquor or other such vices.
('62', 275, 2, 6, 532284) They had been economically exploited by Kabulis and Marwaris.
('62', 275, 3, 7, 532346) Mahatma Gandhi said that he knew about this deplorable state.
('62', 275, 3, 8, 532408) It is a social problem but to me it seems that the harvest is ready but the labourers are few.
('62', 275, 3, 9, 532503) We require workers to solve this question.
('62', 275, 3, 10, 532546) It cannot be solved by law.
('62', 275, 3, 11, 532574) It requires work in the midst of these people from day to day without expectation of immediate result.
('62', 275, 3, 12, 532677) It would be better to prepare statistics of these men by provinces so that a way might be found out to invite workers from other provinces to go there and work.
('62', 275, 3, 13, 532838) Money alone will not give the kind of workers required.
('62', 275, 3, 14, 532894) If I succeed in reaching Assam I will study the conditions and try to raise some local workers.
('62', 275, 3, 15, 532990) If I fail in this, I would have no doubt that Assam is the most backward of all provinces.
('62', 275, 3, 16, 533081) The question is, however, not only of untouchability but of a different type, but if Assam produces the proper type of workers there will be no difficulty in getting funds enough for carrying on that work.

('62', 275, 5, 19, 533361) December 13, 1933 It is no exaggeration to say that our relations were as intimate as between blood brothers.
('62', 275, 5, 20, 533471) 2 His burning patriotism, his great sacrifice and his unsurpassable love for his children, whom also he gave to the service of the motherland, ought to be as patent to you as they were to me.
('62', 275, 5, 21, 533663) I had the good fortune to be in the closest touch with him ever since I first knew him up to the moment of his death; and I could see that every moment of his life his thoughts were given to the nation he served so singularly.
('62', 275, 5, 22, 533890) To him swaraj was no distant dream; it was his very life breath.
('62', 275, 5, 23, 533955) His hankering after freedom grew in intensity from day to day.
('62', 275, 5, 24, 534018) It is, therefore, in the fitness of things that you should
('62', 275, 6, 25, 534077) 1 The meeting was held in the Hindu College.
('62', 275, 6, 26, 534122) 2 Gandhiji had unveiled a portrait of Motilal Nehru.

('62', 276, 1, 2, 534222) have before your eyes the portrait of such a great patriot, so that you may be constantly reminded of his sterling qualities and try to assimilate them in your own lives.
('62', 276, 1, 3, 534393) No lip homage paid to a patriot you admire will be of any use to you, if you do not mean to imitate the virtues that made him great.
('62', 276, 1, 4, 534526) Your keeping his portrait before you must be significant of your resolve to follow in his footsteps.
('62', 276, 1, 5, 534627) Remember, too, that he was above all distinctions of high and low.
('62', 276, 1, 6, 534694) He never gave a place to untouchability in his long and varied life.
('62', 276, 1, 7, 534763) He had the heart of a prince.
('62', 276, 1, 8, 534793) He knew how to earn as well as to give away.
('62', 276, 2, 9, 534838) He then asked the students to give a more tangible proof than money of their
('62', 276, 3, 10, 534915) love for the Harijans by clearing the Augean stables, in other words, the Harijan bastis of Delhi.
('62', 276, 3, 11, 535014) He had seen the terrible contrast between the palaces of New Delhi,
('62', 276, 4, 12, 535082) where money had been poured out like water, and the veritable hells in which the
('62', 276, 5, 13, 535163) Harijans were forced to live; and he spoke with an agony too deep for words.
('62', 276, 5, 14, 535240) I saw three bastis out of four, one of them being the worst of all.
('62', 276, 5, 15, 535308) One cannot imagine, unless one has been with one own eyes, that there can be such a place for human habitation.
('62', 276, 5, 16, 535420) I have no words to describe the filth and ugliness I saw there.
('62', 276, 5, 17, 535484) It is enough to give one a feeling of nausea.
('62', 276, 5, 18, 535530) You should gird up your loins and clean these plague spots.
('62', 276, 5, 19, 535590) I was happy to learn that there are among you students who have a desire to serve the Harijans by physical labour also.
('62', 276, 5, 20, 535710) When you have removed the filth from the bastis, you will discover many other ways of most useful service.

('62', 276, 8, 23, 535865) DELHI Wednesday, December 13, 1933 I have just read Sir Mohammed Iqbals answer 1 to Shri Jawaharlal Nehrus indictment 2 of the communal spirit whether among Muslims of Hindus in so far as they may be represented by their sectarian organizations.
('62', 276, 8, 24, 536111) Reluctant though I am to intervene in the controversy, I may not leave unchallenged the statements made by Sir.
('62', 276, 8, 25, 536223) Mohammed Iqbal ragarding me.

('62', 277, 1, 2, 536416) My position in London 1 was clear.
('62', 277, 1, 3, 536451) I was helpless for effective action on communal matters without Dr. Ansari.
('62', 277, 1, 4, 536527) I was bound by the Congress mandate and before I could recommend any modification I should need Dr. Ansaris guidance.
('62', 277, 1, 5, 536645) Having forfeited, for the time being, Maulana Shaukat Alis confidence, I told Muslim friends that Dr. Ansari held my conscience on Muslim matters in his pocket and that therefore they should co operate with me in securing his presence at the Conference.
('62', 277, 1, 6, 536899) To this they would not agree, unless I would first accept their demands.
('62', 277, 1, 7, 536972) My effort having failed, I tried every other resource at my disposal to achieve real unity and hopelessly failed.
('62', 277, 1, 8, 537086) The offer to act as camp followers to the Congress seemed then, as it has proved since, to be a mockery.
('62', 277, 1, 9, 537191) Behind the talks, there was an oppressive sense of unreality.
('62', 277, 1, 10, 537253) What Sir Mohammed Iqbal calls two conditions attached to my personal acceptance of Muslim demands, were no conditions but the necessary consequence of my acceptance.
('62', 277, 1, 11, 537419) Political unity was desired for a political end which for me, as for any Indian be he Hindu, Muslim, Christian or any other, could only be complete national independence in the fullest sense of the term.
('62', 277, 1, 12, 537623) Muslim demands were presented for arriving at common action.
('62', 277, 1, 13, 537684) Muslim friends in London were playing other minorities against the vital national interest.
('62', 277, 1, 14, 537776) If they accepted me as their ally, as I offered to be in uttermost sincerity, my alliance could only be for combating every force that was inimical to Indias freedom.
('62', 277, 1, 15, 537943) It was, therefore, necessary to fight the spirit of separateness, no matter from what source it arose.
('62', 277, 1, 16, 538046) No Muslim had defended separate electorates as a thing good in itself.
('62', 277, 1, 17, 538117) Even in their case, Muslim friends had admitted it as a necessary evil to be tolerated for a temporary period.
('62', 277, 1, 18, 538228) The doctrine, therefore, did not admit of indefinite extension.
('62', 277, 1, 19, 538292) The demand put forth on behalf of the so called untouchables was clearly anti national.
('62', 277, 1, 20, 538380) But if it was consistent with national interest or was necessary for the protection of the Harijan interest, my resistance was truly inhuman as Sir Moha mmed Iqbal characterizes it.
('62', 277, 1, 21, 538562) But in that case, Muslim friends should not even have offered to be neutral if I accepted their demands.
('62', 277, 1, 22, 538667) But I hold that my resistance was not only not inhuman but it was conceived in the best interests of the Harijans.
('62', 277, 1, 23, 538782) I claim to be a Harijan by choice.
('62', 277, 1, 24, 538817) I do not yield to the tallest

('62', 278, 1, 2, 538934) Harijan in the desire to conserve the Harijan interest.
('62', 278, 1, 3, 538990) Evidently Sir Mohammed Iqbal has had no time to follow what I have done or am doing in this behalf.
('62', 278, 1, 4, 539090) Had he even cursorily followed my doings, he would not have allowed himself to say, as he has said, that Mr. Gandhi has made it a mission of his life to prevent the fusion of the untouchables with the other communities and to retain them in the fold of Hinduism without any real fusion between them and even the caste Hindus. He should know that the rooting out of untouchability is the aim of my life which I have persued without interruption for the past fifty years and that I have claimed and am fighting for the same rights without reservation for the Harijans that the caste Hindus have in matters religious, social and political.
('62', 278, 1, 5, 539727) My work about Harijans is purely religious.
('62', 278, 1, 6, 539771) It has no political motive behind it.
('62', 278, 1, 7, 539809) It is essentially humanitarian in the highest sense of the term.
('62', 278, 1, 8, 539874) It is a movement of internal reform in Hinduism.
('62', 278, 1, 9, 539923) It is one of expiation and reparation by caste Hindus for inhumanities heaped upon the outcastes of Hindu society.
('62', 278, 1, 10, 540038) My Hinduism, like my nation alism, is not exclusive or inconsistent with the interest of any portion of humanity.
('62', 278, 1, 11, 540152) I would refuse to call that freedom which may involve the sacrifice of Muslim or any other interest that is not hostile to the freedom of India.
('62', 278, 1, 12, 540297) I approached every question in London in that spirit.
('62', 278, 1, 13, 540351) My belief in the necessity of communal unity is just as firm as ever before.
('62', 278, 1, 14, 540428) What could I do now, it may be asked.
('62', 278, 1, 15, 540466) My position is the same now as before.
('62', 278, 1, 16, 540505) I would accept any solution that may commend itself to the Muslims as a whole and that is not in conflict with any other national interest.
('62', 278, 1, 17, 540645) Naturally, I endorse the suggestion made by Shri Jawaharlal Nehru.
('62', 278, 1, 18, 540712) Nothing can be fairer.
('62', 278, 1, 19, 540735) As a nationalist I claim to represent all communities equally, the largest as well as the smallest.

('62', 279, 2, 3, 540950) December 14, 1933 It is not to keep you segregated that the schools are being opened and wells are being dug for you.
('62', 279, 2, 4, 541068) All this is being done because I cannot bear to see you get no water at all.
('62', 279, 2, 5, 541145) How can I tolerate that the Harijans get water from the same trough from which dogs and cattle drink water ?
('62', 279, 2, 6, 541254) You belong to the cities and perhaps get water from the taps.
('62', 279, 2, 7, 541316) But in villages, the caste Hindus are so arrogant that they do not permit the Harijans to go near the wells at all.
('62', 279, 2, 8, 541432) Even when they give them water, they do so from a distance and with words of abuse.
('62', 279, 2, 9, 541516) You and I ought not to tolerate such a thing.
('62', 279, 2, 10, 541562) Wells are being dug for Harijans not to keep them as untouchables, but in order that they may at least get clean water.
('62', 279, 2, 11, 541682) And these wells are not exclusively for the Harijans.
('62', 279, 2, 12, 541736) Others too can draw water from them.
('62', 279, 2, 13, 541773) But the Harijans have a right to use them.
('62', 279, 2, 14, 541816) They oughts not to have to take water from a trough.
('62', 279, 2, 15, 541869) The fact is, we have not been able to dig as many wells for them as are needed.
('62', 279, 2, 16, 541949) And you also see that many caste Hindus are voluntarily opening their wells for the use of Harijans.
('62', 279, 2, 17, 542050) The same is true about schools.
('62', 279, 2, 18, 542082) Our efforts to get Harijans admitted to the general schools are continuing.
('62', 279, 2, 19, 542158) But till such time as we can get Harijans admitted into all general schools, the question is whether we should open separate schools for them or let their children remain without education.
('62', 279, 2, 20, 542348) That is why we are opening schools for them.
('62', 279, 2, 21, 542393) Other children also are welcome to join these schools.
('62', 279, 2, 22, 542448) But the Harijans at any rate have the fullest right to join them.
('62', 279, 2, 23, 542514) By calling you Harijans, we have given you a sweet name in place of an offensive one.
('62', 279, 2, 24, 542600) Many Harijans have accepted it.
('62', 279, 2, 25, 542632) It is a better name than the offensive word untouchable.
('62', 279, 2, 26, 542689) And the name was suggested by a Harijan.
('62', 279, 2, 27, 542730) It at least avoids the discourtesy involved in addressing somebody by an offensive name.
('62', 279, 2, 28, 542819) When untouchability has disappeared, either all Hindus would call themselves Harijans or the Harijans would be completely absorbed in the Hindu society.
('62', 279, 2, 29, 542972) The third alternative is that the Hindu community itself would be wiped out.
('62', 279, 2, 30, 543049) But it is to avert this danger that a great effort is being made
('62', 279, 3, 31, 543114) 1 The address presented by the Harijans of Shraddhananda Nagari suggested that separate wells, temples and schools should not be opened for Harijans as this would mean their separation from the Hindu fold.
('62', 280, 0, 1, 543320) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 281
('62', 280, 1, 2, 543367) That is the work being carried on by the Harijan Sevak Sangh for the eradication of untouchability.
('62', 280, 1, 3, 543467) I am happy that I have come to the Shraddhananda Colony.
('62', 280, 1, 4, 543524) Is there any Hindu who is unfamiliar with the name of the late Shraddhanandaji ?
('62', 280, 1, 5, 543605) There can hardly be anyone who feels the love and kindness for Harijans which Shraddhanandaji did.
('62', 280, 1, 6, 543704) He was extremely unhappy that the Hindus in their arrogance had created a class of untouchables.
('62', 280, 1, 7, 543801) The Hindu community will have to wash away that sin or perish.
('62', 280, 1, 8, 543864) You should help in washing off that sin.
('62', 280, 1, 9, 543905) Take this message to other Harijans, too.
('62', 280, 1, 10, 543947) Contribute your mite to this yajna of self purification which is being carried on.
('62', 280, 1, 11, 544030) Maintain both outer and inner purity.
('62', 280, 1, 12, 544068) Give up eating carrion and beef.
('62', 280, 1, 13, 544101) These three things you must definitely do.
('62', 280, 1, 14, 544144) The fourth thing is that you must give up liquor.
('62', 280, 1, 15, 544194) Give it up even if other Hindus drink.
('62', 280, 1, 16, 544233) You have been degraded by others and you have to rise by your own efforts.
('62', 280, 1, 17, 544308) That is why I appeal to you to give up liquor.
('62', 280, 1, 18, 544355) Please do this much and persuade other Harijans also to do it.
('62', 280, 1, 19, 544418) You have presented a purse to me.
('62', 280, 1, 20, 544452) But I do not want a single pie from the Harijans.
('62', 280, 1, 21, 544502) It is we who have to give to you.
('62', 280, 1, 22, 544536) We owe you a debt.
('62', 280, 1, 23, 544555) However, I have accepted the purse since you have given it.
('62', 280, 1, 24, 544615) The sum would be returned to you many times over.
('62', 280, 1, 25, 544665) It is, however, not necessary for you to give anything.

('62', 280, 5, 29, 544800) December 14, 1933 In the eyes of God who is the Creator of all, His creatures are all equal.
('62', 280, 5, 30, 544893) Had He made any distinctions of high and low between man and man, they would have been visible as are the distinctions between, say, an elephant and an ant.
('62', 280, 5, 31, 545050) But he has endowed all human beings impartially with the same shape and the same natural wants.
('62', 280, 5, 32, 545146) If you consider Harijans untouchables because they perform sanitary service, what mother has not performed such service for her children ?
('62', 280, 5, 33, 545285) Does she then become an untouchable on that score ?
('62', 280, 5, 34, 545337) As she can become pure after a wash, sweepers also can come under the same rule.
('62', 280, 5, 35, 545418) 1 It is the height of in justice to consider the Harijans, who are the most

('62', 281, 1, 3, 545659) I have undertaken this tour to awaken the minds of Hindu sisters to a sense of this sin.
('62', 281, 1, 4, 545748) It can never be an act of merit to look down upon any human being as inferior to us.
('62', 281, 1, 5, 545833) We are all worshippers of one God, whom we worship under different names.
('62', 281, 1, 6, 545907) We must , therefore, realize our essential unity and give up untouchability as well as the spirit of superiority and inferiority between human beings.

('62', 281, 3, 8, 546078) 311. WHAT I SAW IN ANANTPUR
('62', 281, 4, 9, 546106) Anantpur is a little village in Saugor District, C. P. (Hindi), containing 177 houses with a population, therefore, roughly of 885. It is 35 miles from the nearest railway station.
('62', 281, 4, 10, 546287) It has no Post or Telegraph Office.
('62', 281, 4, 11, 546323) There is a weekly service from the nearest Post Office, Relly, 12 miles from Anantpur.
('62', 281, 4, 12, 546410) It is a typically poor village of poor India.
('62', 281, 4, 13, 546456) The villagers are occupied not more than four months in the year.
('62', 281, 4, 14, 546522) There was hardly any supplementary occupation for the villagers as a whole before an event that happened four years ago.
('62', 281, 4, 15, 546643) It was in 1929 that a young man, with a single minded zeal rarely surpassed, chose Anantpur for his experiment, after a years travelling in search of such a village.
('62', 281, 4, 16, 546809) He is khaddar mad.
('62', 281, 4, 17, 546828) He believes in the message of khaddar even as much as perhaps I do.
('62', 281, 4, 18, 546896) I doubt if he would not replace perhaps by if not more than.
('62', 281, 4, 19, 546957) I would submit to his correction, if he made it.
('62', 281, 4, 20, 547006) His faith in himself would put to shame the tallest among us.
('62', 281, 4, 21, 547068) He believes that the only permanent cure for the enforced idleness of the peasantry of India and their consequent chronic poverty is the universal adoption of the spinning wheel.
('62', 281, 4, 22, 547247) His name is Jethalal Govindjee.
('62', 281, 4, 23, 547279) He does not know English.
('62', 281, 4, 24, 547305) He is no Gujarati scholar.
('62', 281, 4, 25, 547332) Himself a town bred man, by dogged pertinacity he has inured himself to the hardships of village life and lives like, and in the midst of, villagers.
('62', 281, 4, 26, 547482) He has three companions with him.
('62', 281, 4, 27, 547516) He is a thorough believer in one thing at a time and, therefore, will not pursue other social service, no matter how tempting it may be.
('62', 281, 4, 28, 547653) If the spinning wheel is well established in every cottage, he thinks that all the other problems that puzzle and drag down villagers will solve themselves.
('62', 281, 4, 29, 547810) He will say : I shant preach temperance or thrift to the villager, for no drunkard will take to the wheel if he will not give up his drink, and to preach thrift to a pauper is a mockery.
('62', 281, 4, 30, 547997) It will be time

('62', 282, 1, 2, 548060) to preach it, when I have put a few coppers in his pocket.
('62', 282, 1, 3, 548119) Since I believe that every revolution of the wheel will mean a revolution in his daily life, I am going to be patient with his vices and many drawbacks.
('62', 282, 1, 4, 548272) And I have faith that, if I am a clean man, my cleanness cannot but touch both the inside and the outside of the villager. With varying fortunes, but with an unvarying faith, he and his companions have plodded for the past four years.
('62', 282, 1, 5, 548507) Their formula is Self dependence writ large.
('62', 282, 1, 6, 548552) Khadi must support itself.
('62', 282, 1, 7, 548579) The way to make it do so is for the villagers to spin, and weave too if possible, for their own use.
('62', 282, 1, 8, 548680) They may sell only the surplus, as they do with the grain they grow.
('62', 282, 1, 9, 548749) No cloth can be cheaper than that spun and woven in ones home, even as no bread can be cheaper than home baked from grain grown in ones own field and ground in ones own home.
('62', 282, 1, 10, 548924) The business of these servants of the villagers is merely to instruct and help.
('62', 282, 1, 11, 549004) They visit every cottage and offer to teach them ginning, spinning, carding, weaving and dyeing.
('62', 282, 1, 12, 549101) They improve their wheels and manufacture new ones for sale only from the material available in the village.
('62', 282, 1, 13, 549210) This has given extra work to the village carpenter and the village blacksmith.
('62', 282, 1, 14, 549289) Every item is well thought out.
('62', 282, 1, 15, 549321) They have an almost complete record of the condition of every cottage and its dwellers.
('62', 282, 1, 16, 549409) They have made a fairly accurate study of the villagers wants and woes, customs and manners, and have published their report in Hindi.
('62', 282, 1, 17, 549544) Their workshop is a busy hive.
('62', 282, 1, 18, 549575) Work is being done in a neat and methodical manner.
('62', 282, 1, 19, 549627) A common log book is kept containing a day to day summary of the work done by each worker.
('62', 282, 1, 20, 549718) I have mentioned only four foundation workers.
('62', 282, 1, 21, 549765) Needless to say they have raised workers in seventeen villages they are serving within a five mile radius of Anantpur.
('62', 282, 1, 22, 549884) A word as to the condition of the cottages I saw.
('62', 282, 1, 23, 549934) I visited over six, including one belonging to a Harijan.
('62', 282, 1, 24, 549992) I may not omit to mention that the Harijans have been found to be the readiest to take to the message.
('62', 282, 1, 25, 550095) The cottages I saw were low roofed, with walls made of mud.
('62', 282, 1, 26, 550155) There was no ventilation in them worth mentioning, no boxes, hardly any metal pots.
('62', 282, 1, 27, 550239) The inmates were in rags, except where they had made khaddar for themselves.
('62', 282, 1, 28, 550316) The only belonging I saw consisted generally of empty mud granaries to contain grain for the year.
('62', 282, 1, 29, 550415) One room served as kitchen, dwelling and the rest.
('62', 282, 1, 30, 550466) Their beds were straw covered with rags, again except where they had woven khaddar for themselves.
('62', 282, 1, 31, 550565) Their food consists of jawar chapatis and a pulse, with or without oil.
('62', 282, 1, 32, 550637) Of milk and ghee they hardly ever have anything.
('62', 282, 1, 33, 550686) The Chamar whose
('62', 283, 0, 1, 550703) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 284
('62', 283, 1, 2, 550745) cottage I saw was an exception.
('62', 283, 1, 3, 550777) He sported two cows.
('62', 283, 1, 4, 550798) Whether he or his children ever get a drop of milk for themselves is another story.
('62', 283, 1, 5, 550882) The villagers were poorly fed and worse clothed.
('62', 283, 1, 6, 550931) Some children go stark naked from years end to years end.
('62', 283, 1, 7, 550989) They warm themselves in the sun by day and before a wretched fire at night.
('62', 283, 1, 8, 551065) There are families in Anantpur who, I am told, started this khaddar industry literally with an investment of one pice for cotton.
('62', 283, 1, 9, 551195) This was doubled the next day by the sale of yarn spun from one pice worth of cotton and thus by progressive realization they are able now to have their own clothes.
('62', 283, 1, 10, 551361) I translate the following from the leaflet prepared for the occasion of my visit : The following is the cost of the complete outfit : Ginning machine Rs. 0 7 0 Carding bow with gut and striker  0 9 6 Spinning wheel with spindle  0 6 6 Winding frame  0 1 0 Handloom for 32 inches width with all accessories  3 0 0 Total 4 8 0 We serve seventeen villages lying within a five mile radius, containing 1,100 cottages with a population of 5,500 in round numbers.
('62', 283, 1, 11, 551818) As a result of our labours, eighty per cent of the population have learnt spinning, sixty percent have learnt carding.
('62', 283, 1, 12, 551937) Over hundred persons have learnt weaving.
('62', 283, 1, 13, 551979) The average strength of yarn has now reached fifty six, the average count ten.
('62', 283, 1, 14, 552058) Their average working days are hundred and twenty during the year, the balance of the time lying quite idle.
('62', 283, 1, 15, 552167) Of the idle hours, now an individual gives on an average five hundred hours during the year to khaddar work.
('62', 283, 1, 16, 552276) Our ideal is to reach 1,600 hours per year.
('62', 283, 1, 17, 552320) The progress of our work now depends upon our ability to raise more workers.
('62', 283, 1, 18, 552397) We have today three principal workers, three assistants, five sub assistants, five helpers and four candidates.
('62', 283, 1, 19, 552509) Our average monthly expense is Rs. 325 found by the All India Spinners Association.
('62', 283, 1, 20, 552593) I bring this great experiment to the notice of the public to show not only what it means to Harijans but also to all villagers.
('62', 283, 1, 21, 552721) The aim of
('62', 284, 0, 1, 552732) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 285
('62', 284, 1, 2, 552779) the experiment is not exclusively Harijan service, it is service of the under fed and the under clothed, exclusively through the spinning wheel.
('62', 284, 1, 3, 552924) I have known nothing simpler, cheaper and yet more effective than this experiment of village uplift through khaddar.
('62', 284, 1, 4, 553041) The progress seems to be undoubtedly slow just now, but I expect that it will be found to be the quickest in the end.

('62', 284, 4, 7, 553203) During the past month of touring there has been a great deal of waste of time, a great deal of anxiety to the organizers and a great and unnecessary strain on my very limited physical resources, owing to the mad rush made towards the passing car.
('62', 284, 4, 8, 553450) I cannot recall occasions when people near me have not trodden on my naked toes or scratched my legs.
('62', 284, 4, 9, 553552) God has saved me from serious injury hitherto.
('62', 284, 4, 10, 553599) But the crowds can take no credit for the immunity.
('62', 284, 4, 11, 553651) Their affection is mad.
('62', 284, 4, 12, 553675) And madness can do nobody any good.
('62', 284, 4, 13, 553711) The thing can be easily managed if the volunteers will act in a business like manner and will not themselves, like crowds, go mad as they often do.
('62', 284, 4, 14, 553859) People cannot be instructed on anything all of a sudden.
('62', 284, 4, 15, 553916) Leaflets containing detailed instructions should, therefore, be issued to the public and read and explained to them by volunteers as they come to the venue of meetings.
('62', 284, 4, 16, 554085) The very best arrangement of the kind was made at Harda.
('62', 284, 4, 17, 554142) Although the party was taken through a crowded and decorated bazaar, it took no more than ten minutes to pass through.
('62', 284, 4, 18, 554261) In other places the same distance has often taken more than half an hour.
('62', 284, 4, 19, 554335) Success at Harda was due not merely to previous preparations, but also to volunteers with one continuous rope held by them being posted at regular intervals, thus making it impossible for anyone to break through the lines.
('62', 284, 4, 20, 554558) Let me now without further comment tabulate the instructions which I suggest for general adoption.
('62', 284, 4, 21, 554657) (1) Leaflets containing detailed instructions should be issued to the villagers in simple language easily to be understood by them.
('62', 284, 4, 22, 554789) These should be read to the parties as they stream in from villages.
('62', 284, 4, 23, 554858) (2) Crowds that gather at stations awaiting my arrival should stand in rows upon rows without causing inconvenience to the passengers and without moving from their places when the train steams in.
('62', 285, 0, 1, 555055) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 286
('62', 285, 1, 2, 555097) (3) A few minutes before the arrival time, volunteers should be posted in front of the crowd with a continuous rope, held waist high in their hands in order to avoid the people behind unconsciously moving towards me and the train.
('62', 285, 1, 3, 555328) (4) Volunteers should on no account fall prostrate before me.
('62', 285, 1, 4, 555390) (5) Volunteers should never lead or take part in the various cries.
('62', 285, 1, 5, 555458) Apart from its interfering with efficient service, their leading or participating in them robs the cries of spontaneity.
('62', 285, 1, 6, 555579) (6) Volunteers should not shout their instructions to the public, but should pronounce them with deliberation and gentleness.
('62', 285, 1, 7, 555705) Only one volunteer detailed for the purpose should pronounce them.
('62', 285, 1, 8, 555772) (7) The public should be requested not to crowd round the cars.
('62', 285, 1, 9, 555836) (8) Volunteers should not board my or any other car, except when asked to do so by a responsible member of the Reception Committee.
('62', 285, 1, 10, 555968) (9) The public should not gather at the stations which I may be passing through between 8 p.
('62', 285, 1, 11, 556061) and 6 a.
('62', 285, 1, 12, 556070) m., and in no case should they shout the usual cries at night.
('62', 285, 1, 13, 556133) Such shouting during night betrays want of consideration for the passengers and the party whom they profess to respect.
('62', 285, 1, 14, 556253) (10) Those who gather at stations whether by day or night would do well to remember that I am not conducting a tour for receiving addresses.
('62', 285, 1, 15, 556394) It is intended to be wholly a call for self purification, an invitation to the so called high class Hindus to repent of the wrong done by them to Harijans and for making collections on behalf of the cause.
('62', 285, 1, 16, 556600) Therefore, those who gather at the stations are naturally expected to bring or collective donations for Harijan service.

('62', 286, 1, 2, 557121) Your letters are valuable.
('62', 286, 1, 3, 557148) What you say about Bhulabhai Desais work does not surprise.
('62', 286, 1, 4, 557208) I had expected nothing less.
('62', 286, 1, 5, 557237) As to the imaginary interview in Rome, of course, I never saw the reaffirmation by the Rome pressman.
('62', 286, 1, 6, 557339) 1 I was in prison.
('62', 286, 1, 7, 557358) But if I see the first statement and the reaffirmation, I would be able to throw light on it.
('62', 286, 1, 8, 557452) That those who wont believe will receive no help is only too true.
('62', 286, 1, 9, 557519) But that does not matter.
('62', 286, 1, 10, 557545) I must satisfy honest doubters.
('62', 286, 1, 11, 557577) The quickest way for you is for yourself or some friend to secure the Times file and copy the two statements and send them on to me before 3rd August next 2. Long enough notice for you!
('62', 286, 1, 12, 557763) It will be a good thing if your effort results in Bose being allowed to go to England.
('62', 286, 1, 13, 557850) Why he is kept out [of] London I cannot understand.
('62', 286, 1, 14, 557902) The usual cuttings accompany this.
('62', 286, 1, 15, 557937) The orthodox opposition to the reform is slowly getting out of the bewilderment in which the phenomenal mass attendances at the meetings found it.
('62', 286, 1, 16, 558084) Though they are very few so far as I can judge they have money to sustain them.
('62', 286, 1, 17, 558164) They are therefore trying to create disturbances at meetings.
('62', 286, 1, 18, 558226) But I hope to be able to cope with the opposition.
('62', 286, 1, 19, 558277) The political situation remains much the same as before.
('62', 286, 1, 20, 558334) The official mind is revealed in the speech of the Commissioner of Burdwan.

('62', 287, 12, 28, 560078) It is the test of our loyalty to God that we believe in Him even when He refuses to fulfil our wishes.

('62', 288, 4, 11, 560812) Of course you can, provided that you give me no credit for the composition.
('62', 288, 4, 12, 560888) You may say in the introduction that I had prepared a rough translation for the use of English friends but principally for Mira and that you had worked upon the translation.

('62', 289, 1, 2, 561791) 319. DISCUSSION WITH A SANATANIST 1
('62', 289, 2, 3, 561827) [Before December 16, 1933] You should realize that there are shastris who claim to be sana tanists and who support the reformers contention.
('62', 289, 2, 4, 561968) How am I to reject their testimony as false?
('62', 289, 2, 5, 562013) They fortify me in my opinion that untouchability has no sanction in the shastras.
('62', 289, 2, 6, 562096) I do believe in the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Smritis and the Puranas.
('62', 289, 2, 7, 562168) But to me the Gita is the key to a knowledge of the Shastras.
('62', 289, 2, 8, 562230) It enunciates the principles on which all conduct must be based.
('62', 289, 2, 9, 562295) It sums up the whole of the Shastras and, therefore, absolves laymen from having to explore the other books.
('62', 289, 2, 10, 562404) But I go a step further.
('62', 289, 2, 11, 562429) The Vedas are not the four books known as such.
('62', 289, 2, 12, 562477) They contain only fragments of the originals.
('62', 289, 2, 13, 562523) Eternal truth cannot be buried in or confined to printed books.
('62', 289, 2, 14, 562587) The Vedas are, therefore, indefinable and unwritten.
('62', 289, 2, 15, 562640) They reside in ones heart.
('62', 289, 2, 16, 562667) And our Shastras tell us what discipline and study are necessary for opening out the heart for receiving the truth.
('62', 289, 2, 17, 562783) Ones experience, therefore, must be the final guide.
('62', 289, 2, 18, 562836) The written word undoubtedly helps, but even that has to be interpreted and, when there are conflicting interpretations, the seeker is the final arbiter.
('62', 289, 2, 19, 562990) I had to make my choice.
('62', 289, 2, 20, 563015) Years ago I made it and came to the conclusion that the Shastras did not countenance untouchability as we practise it today.

('62', 289, 4, 22, 563160) 320. SPEECH AT HARIJAN WORKERS MEETING
('62', 289, 5, 23, 563199) VIJAYAWADA, December 16, 1933
('62', 289, 6, 24, 563229) It gave him great pleasure, [Gandhiji] said, to have met them all and witnessed the evidences of their literary powers.
('62', 289, 6, 25, 563349) He had always known, he said, that the people of Andhradesha were good at composing poems and rendering them sweetly and as such he could not help feeling that the recitations witnessed that evening were to some extent useless.
('62', 289, 6, 26, 563577) Poetry and art should be the vehicle of truth and never be utilized for flattery.
('62', 289, 6, 27, 563659) For, such a use of poetry would not only make for degeneration of the art but would also be a violation of truth.
('62', 289, 6, 28, 563773) Now that they were all engaged in a movement for the purification of Hinduism, he expected everyone so engaged to tread the path of
('62', 289, 7, 29, 563905) 1 Who met Gandhiji on the way to Vijayawada, formerly known as Bezwada.
('62', 289, 7, 30, 563977) Gandhiji reached there on December 16.
('62', 290, 0, 1, 564016) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 291
('62', 290, 1, 2, 564063) He had great expectations of Andhradesh and he knew she could rise equal to them.
('62', 290, 2, 3, 564145) Be you caste Hindu or Harijan, let what contribution you are making to the Harijan cause be absolutely unalloyed.
('62', 290, 2, 4, 564259) There can be no room for selfishness, hypocrisy, untruth and violence in such a movement.
('62', 290, 2, 5, 564349) As a religious movement it ought to touch the hearts of Harijans and savarnas alike.
('62', 290, 2, 6, 564434) For hundreds of years considerations of high and low have gone deep into our hearts.
('62', 290, 2, 7, 564519) Religious weapons alone kill untouchability.
('62', 290, 2, 8, 564564) An array of Hindu saints and sages have taught us that penance was the only way to protect and purify religion.
('62', 290, 2, 9, 564676) Needless to say that there can be place for selfishness and egoism in a penance.
('62', 290, 2, 10, 564757) I hope and pray that those engaged in Harijan service will be guided by the purest of motives.
('62', 290, 3, 11, 564852) He appealed to all those savarnas and avarnas who were engaged in this work to realize the paramount importance of self purification and to look upon this work as a shuddhiyajna.
('62', 290, 4, 12, 565031) Mr. Shambu Sastri asked if Gandhiji accepted the authority of the Vedas.
('62', 290, 4, 13, 565104) Most certainly.
('62', 290, 5, 14, 565120) You respect them and abide by them?
('62', 290, 5, 15, 565156) Certainly.
('62', 290, 6, 16, 565167) The next question was whether he would accept the position that Harijans if admitted to temples should also abide by the injunctions of Shastras by which temples were regulated.
('62', 290, 6, 17, 565345) All Shastric rules that apply to savarnas when observed by Harijans must enable them to get entry into temples.
('62', 290, 7, 18, 565457) All my past and present actions have been in accordance with religion as I have understood it.
('62', 290, 7, 19, 565552) I have no doubt that the present endeavour for the removal of untouchability has Vedic authority behind it.
('62', 290, 7, 20, 565660) I must, however, admit that there are two schools of thought on this question.
('62', 290, 7, 21, 565739) Both claim to be sanatanists and base their opinions on the Hindu scriptures.
('62', 290, 7, 22, 565817) I hold that those who are conducting this drive against untouchability as a religious movement must treat their opponents

('62', 290, 8, 24, 565984) 2 What follows is from The Hindu.
('62', 290, 9, 25, 566018) 3 Gandhiji then invited questions from those present.

('62', 291, 0, 1, 566117) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 292
('62', 291, 1, 2, 566159) with tolerance give them always a dispassionate and patient hearing and in no case show any anger in word or deed.
('62', 291, 1, 3, 566274) We are out to convert them.
('62', 291, 1, 4, 566302) Let us seek their help and co operation too.
('62', 291, 1, 5, 566347) I implicitly believe that they will one day join us if only we worked with scrupulous care in a religious spirit.
('62', 291, 1, 6, 566461) Our hearts should be full of love for them and if we are pure we are sure to win their hearts.

('62', 291, 4, 9, 566658) December 16, 1933
('62', 291, 5, 10, 566676) After apologizing for his inability to make himself heard by them all, Gandhiji acknowledged with thanks the several addresses presented to him and their monetary accompaniments.
('62', 291, 5, 11, 566855) But would it not have been better if all the purses had been pooled into one ?
('62', 291, 5, 12, 566934) We could have saved several precious minutes thereby but it is our misfortune that it was not done.
('62', 291, 5, 13, 567034) People wish to present addresses and purses each in his own name or in the name of his village,although all of us belong to the same country and are in the same condition.
('62', 291, 6, 14, 567206) Proceeding, Gandhiji stated that so far Bezwada had contributed in cash about
('62', 291, 7, 15, 567284) Rs. 3,982 8 0 and he was sure that before he left them, the figure would be rounded off
('62', 291, 8, 16, 567372) into Rs. 5,000. This he knew would not be a great thing for the town to do.
('62', 291, 8, 17, 567448) In this
('62', 291, 9, 18, 567456) connection he could not help feeling the absence of Messrs A. Kaleswara Rao and
('62', 291, 10, 19, 567536) Pattabhi Sitaramayya.
('62', 291, 10, 20, 567558) But, they must pursue their path of duty and not drop Harijan
('62', 291, 11, 21, 567620) work which had now become widespread and was an important item of work.
('62', 291, 12, 22, 567692) they destroyed the evil of untouchability, Hinduism, he feared, would die out.
('62', 291, 13, 23, 567771) not dharma to consider a fellowman an untouchable.
('62', 291, 13, 24, 567822) Harijans must have all rights that Savarnas enjoyed.
('62', 291, 13, 25, 567875) They had committed a great sin by having kept Harijans out
('62', 291, 14, 26, 567934) of their rights all these ages.
('62', 291, 14, 27, 567966) savarnas must, therefore, he said expiate for the sin by
('62', 291, 15, 28, 568023) undergoing a prayashchitta.
('62', 291, 15, 29, 568051) Wherever he had gone on this tour he had witnessed huge
('62', 291, 16, 30, 568107) concourses of people at similar meetings and he took it as a mark of their approval of
('62', 291, 17, 31, 568194) the work he was carrying on.
('62', 291, 17, 32, 568223) That people contributed their mite also pleased him.
('62', 291, 18, 33, 568276) the Harijans he would appeal for support not in monetary shape but in co operating in this shuddhiyajna by observing external and internal purity.
('62', 291, 18, 34, 568423) Internal purity could be
('62', 291, 19, 35, 568448) attained by thinking of God and Ramanama and external purity through bath and other
('62', 291, 20, 36, 568532) means of clean living.
('62', 291, 20, 37, 568555) He would appeal to such of the Harijans as were addicted to
('62', 291, 21, 38, 568615) drink, and eating carrion and cow flesh, to give up these.
('62', 291, 21, 39, 568674) No one who was addicted to
('62', 292, 0, 1, 568701) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 293
('62', 292, 1, 2, 568748) these could be considered to be a Hindu and he could not be admitted into temples.
('62', 292, 2, 3, 568831) Drinking was a heinous sin and a man under its influence could not distinguish
('62', 292, 3, 4, 568910) between mother and wife.
('62', 292, 4, 5, 568935) Before concluding, he referred to the address presented on behalf of the Andhra
('62', 292, 5, 6, 569015) Hindi Pracharakas Association and said that he was immensely gratified to see the
('62', 292, 6, 7, 569097) work carried on in Dakshina Bharat for promoting Hindi.
('62', 292, 6, 8, 569153) He was also glad to note
('62', 292, 7, 9, 569178) that in this matter Andhra led the rest of South India.
('62', 292, 7, 10, 569234) He appealed to them all to help
('62', 292, 8, 11, 569266) in the propagation of Hindi as it was an effective means of serving their country and
('62', 292, 9, 12, 569352) their nation.

('62', 292, 11, 15, 569412) December 17, 1933
('62', 292, 12, 16, 569430) Addressing the gathering, Gandhiji expressed his regret at not being able to
('62', 292, 13, 17, 569507) stay in their midst longer than a few minutes or go into the temples for want of time
('62', 292, 14, 18, 569593) and also the difficulty of getting out of and into the car at every place.
('62', 292, 14, 19, 569668) He wished to
('62', 292, 15, 20, 569681) save as much time as posssible as he had to cover a number of villages.
('62', 292, 15, 21, 569753) If, therefore,
('62', 292, 16, 22, 569768) he did not enter the temples, let them not go under the impression that he did not wish
('62', 292, 17, 23, 569856) to enter the shrines of God.
('62', 292, 17, 24, 569885) He was sure that the work he was doing was his work.
('62', 292, 18, 25, 569938) wished to open as many of the temples in this country as possible to Harijans.
('62', 292, 19, 26, 570017) hoped that Harijans would offer worship at the temples daily along with their other Hindu bretheren observing all the regulations that applied to savarnas and all the
('62', 292, 20, 27, 570184) rules of cleanliness.
('62', 292, 20, 28, 570206) By so doing and by giving up (where they were addicted to the
('62', 292, 21, 29, 570268) habits) drink and carrion or beef eating Harijans would be promoting real purification
('62', 292, 22, 30, 570355) to Hinduism.

('62', 293, 2, 3, 570517) SIDDHANTHAM, December 17, 1933
('62', 293, 3, 4, 570548) May I ask a few questions on some points that strike me as worthy of being brought to your notice ?
('62', 293, 3, 5, 570648) [GANDHIJI :] Most certainly, I am ready.
('62', 293, 3, 6, 570689) Go ahead.
('62', 293, 4, 7, 570699) In a recent meeting which he addressed in Madras Mr. M. K. Acharya has stated that 95 per cent of the Harijan do not want  the Gandhian creed.
('62', 293, 4, 8, 570842) What is your view on the matter ?
('62', 293, 4, 9, 570876) I do not know what the Gandhian creed is.
('62', 293, 4, 10, 570918) If I do not know it, how do the Harijans know it or Mr. Acharya himself?
('62', 293, 4, 11, 570991) I do not claim anything special to me.
('62', 293, 4, 12, 571030) There is no such thing as Gandhian creed so far as I know.
('62', 293, 4, 13, 571089) I know only this.
('62', 293, 4, 14, 571107) I am engaged in giving Harijans clean water.
('62', 293, 4, 15, 571152) I am engaged in giving them facilities for education.
('62', 293, 4, 16, 571206) I am engaged in finding accommodation for them in public caravanserais where they cannot get it.
('62', 293, 4, 17, 571303) I am engaged in weaning them from drink and carrion.
('62', 293, 4, 18, 571356) Do they not like all these?
('62', 293, 4, 19, 571384) I am engaged in teaching them the elementary rules of hygiene.
('62', 293, 4, 20, 571447) Do they not want it ?
('62', 293, 4, 21, 571469) I am engaged in telling them what the fundamentals of Hinduism are and in having public temples thrown open to them.
('62', 293, 4, 22, 571586) Mark the distinction.
('62', 293, 4, 23, 571608) They may not want to enter these temples and if somebody said that they do not want to, I will not be able to prove conclusively to the contrary, though the prima facie evidence that I have is all in my favour.
('62', 293, 4, 24, 571819) Whenever they find temples are thrown open to them, they are simply delirious with joy, as I found them to be today when I opened two temples 2 and entered them with them.
('62', 293, 4, 25, 571991) I do not care whether they want to go to the temples or no.
('62', 293, 4, 26, 572051) I simply feel that savarnas should do their duty.
('62', 293, 4, 27, 572101) There is nothing Gandhian about it.
('62', 293, 4, 28, 572137) Every Hindu who believes that untouchability must go must understand this work.
('62', 293, 5, 29, 572217) It was observed by another person that Gandhiji being a believer in varnas hrama, which was but a graded system of untouchability, he was not qualified to tackle this problem.
('62', 293, 5, 30, 572393) What do you think of this view ?
('62', 293, 5, 31, 572426) For me varnashrama does not mean a graded system of untouchability.
('62', 293, 5, 32, 572494) I have explained what I mean by varnadharma.
('62', 293, 5, 33, 572539) It does

('62', 294, 1, 2, 572680) not mean to me grades at all.
('62', 294, 1, 3, 572710) It is not a vertical division.
('62', 294, 1, 4, 572741) It is a hori zontal one.
('62', 294, 1, 5, 572766) In my view, all varnas stand absolutely on the same plane, i.e., of equality.
('62', 294, 1, 6, 572844) Hence there can be no question of untouchability.
('62', 294, 1, 7, 572894) Varnadharma is a mighty economic law which, if we subscribe to it, would save us from the catastrophe that is in store for the world.
('62', 294, 1, 8, 573028) I have sufficient warrant in Hindu scriptures for saying that Brahmins and scavengers are absolutely on a par in the eyes of God.
('62', 294, 2, 9, 573158) It has been suggested in some quarters that the Harijan movement is a form of
('62', 294, 3, 10, 573236) civil resistance propaganda and that by this tour you are promoting civil resistance.
('62', 294, 4, 11, 573322) What is your opinion on this suggestion ?
('62', 294, 4, 12, 573364) Then I am between two crossfires.
('62', 294, 4, 13, 573398) Congressmen accuse me of having damaged the cause of civil disobedience by taking up this whirlwind campaign.
('62', 294, 4, 14, 573508) Those who suspect me of ulterior motives accuse me of strengthening civil disobedience.
('62', 294, 4, 15, 573596) I am unmoved by these charges or insinuations, and can only re declare that I have absolutely no ulterior motive.
('62', 294, 4, 16, 573710) It is a peremptory religious call which I am obeying.
('62', 294, 4, 17, 573764) The tens of thousands who attend the meetings do not even hear the expression civil resistance from my lips.
('62', 294, 4, 18, 573873) This is purely a religious revival.
('62', 294, 4, 19, 573909) This does not mean that I have changed my views on civil resistance.
('62', 294, 4, 20, 573978) The very science of civil resistance demands absolute honesty.
('62', 294, 4, 21, 574041) If I use this campaign for furthering civil resistance, I should be guilty of dishonesty.
('62', 294, 4, 22, 574131) Civil disobedience does not need such dubious aids.
('62', 294, 5, 23, 574183) What do you think of the progress of Harijan uplift work in the provinces you have toured so far ?
('62', 294, 5, 24, 574282) My impressions are altogether happy and, if they are continued in the other provinces, I would have no hesitation in saying that untouchability is fast dying out.
('62', 294, 5, 25, 574445) On no other basis can I account for the tens of thousands of people who flock to the meetings and give me their coppers, well knowing what these are to be used for.

('62', 294, 7, 27, 574632) 324. SPEECH AT MASULIPATAM
('62', 294, 8, 28, 574659) December 17, 1933
('62', 294, 9, 29, 574677) Replying to the addresses and acknowledging the purses and other presents,
('62', 294, 10, 30, 574752) Gandhiji said that on reaching Masulipatam his first thought was of Dr. Pattabhi
('62', 294, 11, 31, 574833) Sitaramayya.
('62', 294, 11, 32, 574846) He was sure the Doctors spirit was pervading at the meeting though he
('62', 295, 0, 1, 574916) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 296
('62', 295, 1, 2, 574958) was not physically present in their midst.
('62', 295, 1, 3, 575001) He thanked the District and Taluk Boards
('62', 295, 2, 4, 575042) and the people of the district for the work they were doing on behalf of the Harijans.
('62', 295, 2, 5, 575129) But he felt that so long as there was even a single temple which admitted savarnas but
('62', 295, 3, 6, 575216) remained closed to Harijans, which benefited the former but did not equally benefit the
('62', 295, 4, 7, 575304) latter, there would be no rest for him nor should there be any for them.
('62', 295, 4, 8, 575377) If distinction
('62', 295, 5, 9, 575392) of high and low, touchable and untouchable continued amongst Hindus, he was sure
('62', 295, 6, 10, 575473) Hinduism would slowly die out.
('62', 295, 7, 11, 575504) We shall dig our own grave if we do not purge ourselves of this curse of untouchability, we shall have to pay with bitter tears if we in our pride miss the God given opportunity today.
('62', 295, 7, 12, 575689) We should have no peace till this monster is buried and those whom we have hitherto kept under our heels are put on a par with us in every respect.
('62', 295, 7, 13, 575837) Let us awake to the sense of this sin and save, before it is too late, ourselves and our religion from going to perdition.

('62', 295, 10, 16, 576041) AS AT WARDHA, December 19, 1933
('62', 295, 11, 17, 576073) NARAHARI, I am starting to write this letter at six in the morning in Masuli patam.
('62', 295, 11, 18, 576157) I get up daily at three and try to write as many letters as I can.
('62', 295, 11, 19, 576224) The writing is interrupted at six, and at seven generally travelling is resumed.
('62', 295, 11, 20, 576305) On Mondays and Tuesdays there is no travelling.
('62', 295, 11, 21, 576353) Today is Tuesday, and so I have been able to continue to write.
('62', 295, 11, 22, 576417) (After I had written so far, Malkani and Bapi Needu came up and took half an hour of my time.) I had preserved your long letter.
('62', 295, 11, 23, 576546) Your work seems to be going on very well.
('62', 295, 11, 24, 576588) I hope it will continue in the same manner.
('62', 295, 11, 25, 576632) There are ebbs and tides in Mahadevs work.
('62', 295, 11, 26, 576675) He loudly sings All days are not alike.
('62', 295, 11, 27, 576715) (Another interruption, and I gave 20 more minutes to Venka tappayya.) Mahadev is now realizing the truth of that line in his own experience.
('62', 295, 11, 28, 576856) That is how all of us learn and grow.
('62', 295, 11, 29, 576894) Anandi and others are fairly well settled.
('62', 295, 11, 30, 576937) Proper arrangements have been made for their study.
('62', 295, 11, 31, 576989) Ramanama also is being taught by

('62', 296, 1, 8, 577305) Ba has been taken to Yeravda.
('62', 296, 1, 9, 577335) All the questions which you have asked regarding spinning are relevant.
('62', 296, 1, 10, 577407) But those problems cannot be solved at present.
('62', 296, 1, 11, 577455) I cant write about them now, either.
('62', 296, 1, 12, 577492) I have in my mind the solutions of all the problems.
('62', 296, 1, 13, 577545) Whether they will work or not can be discovered only when they are tried.
('62', 296, 1, 14, 577619) If I am alive, I will explain them some day and, God willing, we will even try them.
('62', 296, 1, 15, 577704) Kakas health is fairly good.
('62', 296, 1, 16, 577733) He must have gone to Ahmedabad now.
('62', 296, 1, 17, 577769) He was happy to stay with Swami for a few days.

('62', 296, 1, 20, 577878) He is confined to bed.
('62', 296, 1, 21, 577901) What experiences of the tour should I describe ?
('62', 296, 1, 22, 577950) The crowds at the meetings are larger even than before and contribute generously to the fund.
('62', 296, 1, 23, 578044) Surendra and Durbari are at Wardha.
('62', 296, 1, 24, 578080) They will probably go to Karadi now.
('62', 296, 1, 25, 578117) Both are fairly well.
('62', 296, 1, 26, 578139) A large number of girls have joined at Wardha and requests are still being received.

('62', 296, 1, 28, 578264) Balkrishna cannot be described as enjoying normal health.

('62', 297, 1, 4, 579064) I will send your blessings to everyone.
('62', 297, 1, 5, 579104) Do not worry about anybody.
('62', 297, 1, 6, 579132) I have written to Manu also regarding Kusum.
('62', 297, 1, 7, 579177) The latter is really ill and may or may not survive.

('62', 297, 1, 9, 579279) He is in bed.
('62', 297, 1, 10, 579293) Brijkrishna also has been bed ridden for a long time.

('62', 297, 1, 22, 579830) I will see if I can do so next week.
('62', 297, 1, 23, 579867) It is certainly very good that you read the Gita regularly.
('62', 297, 1, 24, 579927) Who teaches you to read it ?
('62', 297, 1, 25, 579956) What food do you get there ?
('62', 297, 1, 26, 579985) You remember dont you, that you can write to Premlilabehn 1 or Trivedi 2 for anything that you may want.
('62', 297, 1, 27, 580090) You will have fewer visitors there and so the best course will be that you should write one letter to me and receive one from me every week.
('62', 297, 1, 28, 580231) However, you may do as you like.
('62', 297, 1, 29, 580264) Om is all right.

('62', 298, 1, 8, 581057) Malkani is fast becoming an accountant.
('62', 298, 1, 9, 581097) He has also become a newspaper correspondent.
('62', 298, 1, 10, 581143) If he maintains good health, he will work to the best of his ability.
('62', 298, 1, 11, 581213) The crowds at the meetings are as large and the contribution as generous as in the C.P. I have still not been able to observe the four hour rule.
('62', 298, 1, 12, 581359) Nobody, however, is to blame for that.
('62', 298, 1, 13, 581398) Such a rule can only be an ideal.
('62', 298, 1, 14, 581432) In any case, God will ordain everything as He wills.
('62', 298, 1, 15, 581485) I learnt as long ago as my young days to live according to Miras bhajan :
('62', 298, 2, 16, 581559) Hari has tied me with a slender thread,
('62', 298, 3, 17, 581599) I let Him pull as He wills.
('62', 298, 3, 18, 581627) I, therefore, dont experience any difficulty.

('62', 299, 3, 5, 582061) Since you have started the injections, it would be better to complete the course.
('62', 299, 3, 6, 582143) Perhaps you may benefit.
('62', 299, 3, 7, 582168) I myself, though, have little faith in it.
('62', 299, 3, 8, 582211) But once we have started a thing we should go to the end.
('62', 299, 3, 9, 582269) There will be no difficulty in sending Rs. 50 every month to Rajeshwar.

('62', 299, 3, 15, 582676) The blood pressure has returned to my normal.

('62', 300, 7, 15, 583907) December 19, 1933
('62', 300, 8, 16, 583925) BHAGWANJI, I am late in replying to your letter, though I had intended to reply quite soon.
('62', 300, 8, 17, 584017) What you have suggested is right.
('62', 300, 8, 18, 584051) But carry out your idea tactfully and without using compulsion.
('62', 300, 8, 19, 584115) Very few non Harijans will join.
('62', 300, 8, 20, 584148) For them the rule will be compulsory.
('62', 300, 8, 21, 584186) For the Harijans, the problem will be one of education.
('62', 300, 8, 22, 584242) You cannot use compulsion on them.
('62', 300, 8, 23, 584277) They will gradually learn to use lavatories.
('62', 300, 8, 24, 584322) In the locality where Ramji lives, we may certainly construct lavatories if it is possible to introduce them there.
('62', 300, 8, 25, 584438) Parikshital, Jethabhai and you may discuss the matter and do what you think best.
('62', 300, 8, 26, 584520) Do not give up your interest in the Vadaj school.
('62', 300, 8, 27, 584570) The number of children attending it should increase.
('62', 300, 8, 28, 584623) Dont leave even the grown ups.
('62', 300, 8, 29, 584654) This will of course require patience on your part.
('62', 300, 8, 30, 584705) Give up desire for the success of your work.
('62', 300, 8, 31, 584750) Write to me from time to time.

('62', 301, 3, 6, 585186) Once you all have considered and made her your elder, how can you now complain ?

('62', 303, 4, 11, 587795) MR. MAYOR, COUNCILLORS AND FRIENDS, I deeply appreciate the honour you have done me this morning by presenting me for the second time with an address.
('62', 303, 4, 12, 587946) 1 It is always a matter of great pleasure to me to visit the South because, as you know, I have relations with the South of a very long stand ing.
('62', 303, 4, 13, 588093) I came in closest touch with the indentured Indian people in Natal as early as 1893 and some of you may recollect that my first contact in Natal was not only with the South Indians but with the Tamil Indians, and the very first case of distress that I had the good fortune to handle was one in connection with a Tamil.
('62', 303, 4, 14, 588412) 1 Ever since that the South has bound me with ties not to be surpassed by any other part of India.
('62', 303, 4, 15, 588511) You, Sir, may not know, but some of the Councillors and some of the other citizens will perhaps recall the fact that when I first had the honour of receiving an address at the hands of this great Corporation, among the several names that I registered for myself was that of an expert scavenger.
('62', 303, 4, 16, 588806) It was at that time that I referred to the condition of your public streets and how those streets were used for insanitary purposes, even by men who should know better.
('62', 303, 4, 17, 588975) I expect that there has been a vast improvement in that direction.
('62', 303, 4, 18, 589042) But today my mission of scavenging is of a special character, a deeper character and, as I found it, of a purely religious character, taking religion in its broadest sense, not in the narrow sectional sense in which we, at the present day, unfortunately use the term.
('62', 303, 4, 19, 589310) The reform I am aiming at today concerns a body of scaven gers belonging to the Hindu society and does not make it none the less religious in the broadest sense of the term.
('62', 303, 4, 20, 589484) I feel that it is a deeply humanitarian mission to which I have not hesitated to invite the co

('62', 304, 1, 3, 589970) 1 As days advance, you will under stand what this scaven ging mission stands for.
('62', 304, 1, 4, 590052) It stands for abolishing the distinctions of high and low which untouchability undoubtedly means; but you will not expect that, on my entering the Tamil land, I should give an elaborate view of what I consider is the duty of the Hindu humanity towards useful servants of society.
('62', 304, 1, 5, 590332) That I must reserve for another occasion.
('62', 304, 1, 6, 590374) Be it enough for the present, Mr. Mayor and Councillors, for me to thank you once more for the address that you have been good enough to present to me.
('62', 304, 1, 7, 590526) I hope that I will carry with me throughout my tour your sincere prayers in the mission that I have undertaken.

('62', 304, 4, 11, 590732) MR. PRESIDENT AND FRIENDS, I have started out in Madras under happy and good auspices.
('62', 304, 4, 12, 590819) I had the honour of receiving an address from the Corporation and now I have the honour of receiving another address from the Southern Indian Chamber of Commerce at the hands of my friend Mr. Jamal Sahib.
('62', 304, 4, 13, 591024) 3 I have the pleasantest recollection of the long conversations with him in London not more than 18 months ago or something like that.
('62', 304, 4, 14, 591159) We dicussed then things of interest common to the whole of India and now I find myself again in his company.
('62', 304, 4, 15, 591268) With your bless ings, friends, I look forward to the success of my mission in Madras and later on in the whole of Tamil Nadu.
('62', 304, 4, 16, 591394) You have, Sir, asked me to declare the Swadeshi Exhibition open.
('62', 304, 4, 17, 591459) All of you may not be aware that I am a man who thinks and chooses things.
('62', 304, 4, 18, 591534) I regard myself somewhat as an expert in matters of swadeshi.
('62', 304, 4, 19, 591596) I have been instrumental also in organizing more than one exhibition of this kind in India.
('62', 304, 4, 20, 591688) You cannot have everything that grows or is manufactured in India exhibited.

('62', 305, 1, 2, 591990) to make a definite choice in things if you are to make an exhibition of this character of educative value for the public.
('62', 305, 1, 3, 592112) For instance, you would not exhibit any seeds that grow in India like grass.
('62', 305, 1, 4, 592189) You have to pick and choose those seeds and grains which you want to introduce to the public.
('62', 305, 1, 5, 592283) I have given, friends, only an illustration out of many that crowd my memory now.
('62', 305, 1, 6, 592365) I have spoken about this in order to introduce to you a very delicate thing.
('62', 305, 1, 7, 592442) I do not accept invitations to open all and every swadeshi exhibition.
('62', 305, 1, 8, 592513) I want to know whether the delicate wines produced in India are exhibited also.
('62', 305, 1, 9, 592593) If they are, naturally, the fanatical prohibi tionist that I am, I will say to you: Thank you, but I can not open this exhibition, where wines, which are harmful to the moral and economic well being of the country, sparkling though they may be, are exhibited.
('62', 305, 1, 10, 592853) Not equally on the same lines, but somewhat on those lines, I object also to open exhibitions where mill cloths, may be hundred percent swadeshi, are exhibited.
('62', 305, 1, 11, 593014) I do not say it is injurious in the same sense that wines are.
('62', 305, 1, 12, 593077) But if I am expected to open an exhibition of manufactured mill clothsand not things made in cottages in Indiayou will make a very poor show.
('62', 305, 1, 13, 593219) I do not want to pit myself against mill cloth.
('62', 305, 1, 14, 593267) What I want to say is this.
('62', 305, 1, 15, 593295) If you go into the history of the mill industry in India, you will discover it does not need a swadeshi exhibition for its distribution.
('62', 305, 1, 16, 593432) The mills themselves are their own swadeshi exhibition.
('62', 305, 1, 17, 593488) They have got all the facilities of their own.
('62', 305, 1, 18, 593535) But what of khadi ?
('62', 305, 1, 19, 593555) I do not want to say I have opened a swadeshi exhibition where all sorts of things are exhibited.
('62', 305, 1, 20, 593653) It must be an exhibition, not only for your edification but of instruction to those to whom it should be useful.
('62', 305, 1, 21, 593766) I have opened exhibitions in other places and I have been asked to open in a very big city like this a swadeshi exhibition.
('62', 305, 1, 22, 593890) I had therefore to introduce this word of caution.
('62', 305, 1, 23, 593941) Now, do you or do you not think of the various needs of the Harijans ?
('62', 305, 1, 24, 594012) As you know, I am under a self imposed vow, during seven or eight months that remain for me, to do some kind of propaganda work for Harijans.
('62', 305, 1, 25, 594154) I have restricted myself predominantly to do Harijan work and no other work.
('62', 305, 1, 26, 594231) I can talk to many people on varied subjects and there is no end to the varied subjects that do or can interest me.
('62', 305, 1, 27, 594347) At the present moment, I propose to confine myself to the few things that are necessary for the Harijan cause.
('62', 305, 1, 28, 594458) What can a swadeshi exhibition do for Harijans, you may ask.
('62', 305, 1, 29, 594519) I think khadi has got a great deal to do with it, because the introduction of hand spinning and hand weaving of cloth, you will be surprised to know, has brought a ray of comfort and light into the dark homes of thousands of Harijans.
('62', 305, 1, 30, 594754) I had the good fortune to go to
('62', 306, 0, 1, 594786) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 307
('62', 306, 1, 2, 594833) many Harijan homes even during this brief tour and discovered the potency of khadi for Harijans.
('62', 306, 1, 3, 594930) You will also be surprised to know that there are many thingsI hope those things are exhibited hereat which Harijans have worked for the most part, if not entirely.
('62', 306, 1, 4, 595095) There is the leather industry.
('62', 306, 1, 5, 595126) The leather industry will be nowhere in India but for the initial work which the Harijans put into it.
('62', 306, 1, 6, 595229) You will not expect me to take you into the history of it; my friend, Jamal Sahib, will give you chapter and verse about it.
('62', 306, 1, 7, 595354) But I can tell the history in terms of rupees, annas and pies.
('62', 306, 1, 8, 595417) Not less than nine crore rupees worth of hides go out of India which, if we are to deal honourably by Harijans, will all be absorbed in India, or at least not leave the shores in the raw state in which the hides are now sent.
('62', 306, 1, 9, 595643) I can multiply instances.
('62', 306, 1, 10, 595669) But I do not want to detain you or detain myself.
('62', 306, 1, 11, 595719) I have great pleasure in declaring the Exhibition open and I hope you will take advantage of this Exhibition, make it of educative effect, interest yourself in these things that have been brought to the stalls and trace the history of their manufacture and then you will be surprised at the resources the poorest country in the world has at its disposal if we would only work at them intelligently and also work in co operation with the downtrodden millions in India.
('62', 306, 1, 12, 596187) If you would get off their backs and treat the Harijans, the Mahars and the other oppressed and depressed classes as our own comrades entitled to the same privileges and the same honour that we claim for ourselves, then in spite of the tremendous handicaps under which we are working this land of ours can become a land of plenty, a land of prosperity and not of downright pauperism in which the country now is.
('62', 306, 1, 13, 596599) I thank you for inviting me to open this Exhibition and I hope the public will generously patronize it.

('62', 306, 3, 16, 596763) December 20, 1933
('62', 306, 4, 17, 596781) SISTERS, It gives me great pleasure to be able to renew your acquaintance.
('62', 306, 4, 18, 596856) This is not the first time that I am addressing a meeting of ladies in Madras.
('62', 306, 4, 19, 596935) I have before me an extremely heavy programme to be gone through inside of forty minutes.
('62', 306, 4, 20, 597025) Therefore you will excuse me for being very brief.
('62', 306, 4, 21, 597076) I have come here to ask you to do one thing.
('62', 306, 4, 22, 597121) Forget altogether that some are high and some are low.
('62', 306, 4, 23, 597176) Forget altogether that some are touchables and some are untouchables.
('62', 306, 4, 24, 597246) I know that you all believe in
('62', 307, 0, 1, 597277) 308 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('62', 307, 1, 2, 597319) God as I do, and God cannot be so cruel and unjust as to make distinctions of high and low between man and man and woman and woman.
('62', 307, 1, 3, 597451) This untouchability is the greatest blot on Hinduism.
('62', 307, 1, 4, 597505) And I have not hesitated to say that, if untouchability lives, Hinduism dies.
('62', 307, 1, 5, 597583) If only to use mans language, God has been patient with us but I have no hesitation in saying that even Gods patience can be exhausted, and He will no longer be patient with this atrocity that man is doing towards man in Hindu India.
('62', 307, 2, 6, 597817) Gandhiji made a break in his speech at this juncture and said : You have not given me the purse.
('62', 307, 3, 7, 597914) Dr. Muthulakshmi Reddi immediately handed to Gandhiji the purse, saying that it contained cash to the extent of Rs. 430. You have given me a lean purse.
('62', 307, 3, 8, 598067) But lean or fat the purse is meant to serve Harijans.
('62', 307, 4, 9, 598121) Dr. Muthulakshmi Reddi said that many of them had contributed liberally to the purse that was going to be presented to Gandhiji at the public meeting at Tilak Ghat.
('62', 307, 4, 10, 598286) That is the excuse you want to give; all right, I see you are all for equality with men.
('62', 307, 4, 11, 598375) I regard this purse as token on the part of the donors of their desire to do some slight reparation to those whom we have injured in the name of religion.
('62', 307, 4, 12, 598530) Well, anyway, ladies have parted willingly with their jewellery, some with their rings, others with their bangles and necklaces and so on and I invite you to do likewise, but on this understanding, that the jewellery you may part with is not to be replaced and that you should consider the giving as a privilege in connection with the Harijan movement.
('62', 307, 4, 13, 598883) I conclude with a prayer to God Almighty that He may bless this effort and that He may so change your hearts that you will forget the distinctions between touchables and untouchables.
('62', 307, 4, 14, 599067) There is one thing which a sister wants me to say and which I gladly do, namely, to put in a word on behalf of Hindi.
('62', 307, 4, 15, 599185) I expect that some of you would like to serve in other parts of India, in the northern parts of India.
('62', 307, 4, 16, 599288) You cannot mix with the masses in the North unless you understand Hindi.
('62', 307, 4, 17, 599361) Know that 22 crores of the people of India know and understand Hindi.
('62', 307, 4, 18, 599431) Enlightened sisters of the South cannot neglect the language of the 22 crores.
('62', 307, 4, 19, 599510) Well, I have finished, and those who want to part with their jewellery can do so.

('62', 308, 1, 2, 599661) 340. SPEECH AT STUDENTS MEETING, MADRAS
('62', 308, 2, 3, 599701) December 20, 1933
('62', 308, 3, 4, 599719) STUDENTS AND FRIENDS, You are not new to me nor am I new to you.
('62', 308, 3, 5, 599784) I remember you well.
('62', 308, 3, 6, 599805) In 1896 when, of course, many of you were not even born, I made the acquaintance of the students of Madras, when I was an unknown man to you or for that matter to anybody else except those who are called the coolies, that is to say, the people of Tamil Nadu.
('62', 308, 3, 7, 600064) I was even at that time known somewhat amongst them, but I remember what a welcome you gave me at that time.
('62', 308, 3, 8, 600173) I thank you for the purse that you have given me as also for the address you have presented to me.
('62', 308, 3, 9, 600272) I do not need to argue with you, and to convince you that untouchability is the greatest blot on Hinduism.
('62', 308, 3, 10, 600379) I do not need to convince you that after all the education you have received, if you believe in the distinction between man and man, all your education is worthless; but I do want you to realize, if you are convinced, as you state in your address you are convinced, that untouchability is an evil, which we should get rid of.
('62', 308, 3, 11, 600705) I want you to serve the cause; I want you to serve the Harijans.
('62', 308, 3, 12, 600770) I had expected you to say in your address in what way you had served them.
('62', 308, 3, 13, 600845) When I received an address from the students of Delhi, they told me in what way they were serving the Harijans of Delhi, and even the Harijans outside Delhi in the villages.
('62', 308, 3, 14, 601019) I hope you will follow their example.
('62', 308, 3, 15, 601057) They did not pretend that they had done wonders.
('62', 308, 3, 16, 601106) They made some time ago an humble beginning.
('62', 308, 3, 17, 601151) I wonder if you also had made an humble beginningI wonder if you know how much you can do in order to ameliorate the conditions of Harijans and how much you can do by silent service to rid ourselves, our society, of this blot.
('62', 308, 3, 18, 601378) The way to convince the society that untou chability cannot be a part of religion and that it is a hideous error is for you to develop character.
('62', 308, 3, 19, 601524) You will show it in your own lives that to believe in some people being touchable and some untouchable is not only not religion, but it is the reverse of religion.
('62', 308, 3, 20, 601688) Whereas, if you had no character to achieve or lose, naturally people are not going to put any faith whatsoever in you.
('62', 308, 3, 21, 601808) You have got to move the masses.
('62', 308, 3, 22, 601841) You have got to change the hearts of the masses.
('62', 308, 3, 23, 601890) Never mind what the orthodox people who claim to have studied the scriptures may have to say; they do not represent the masses nor do they represent the real interpretation of the scriptures as I hold it.
('62', 308, 3, 24, 602095) It may be that I am in error, but in any case there are a few people who react upon the masses, as you can also react upon the masses.
('62', 308, 3, 25, 602230) I promise you that in the end only those who are working among the masses will be the
('62', 309, 0, 1, 602316) 310 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('62', 309, 1, 2, 602358) deciding factor.
('62', 309, 1, 3, 602375) Masses will not argue.
('62', 309, 1, 4, 602398) They will simply want to know who are the men who go to them and tell them that untouchability in which they have believed for such a long time is an evil,and if they find that those who have approached them, and told them that untouchability is an evil have credentials, they will listen to them, and if they have no credentials they will not listen.
('62', 309, 1, 5, 602750) This is an incredibly simple proposition that I have been putting before you which each one of you can test for yourself.
('62', 309, 1, 6, 602872) How can you serve these men, who are living in your midst?
('62', 309, 1, 7, 602931) I have shown a way for the many students that I have addressed.
('62', 309, 1, 8, 602995) Take a broom and a bucket in your hands, not by way of tamasha, not by way of a spectacle, but sincerely, and work with the broom and the bucket and clean out all those dirty places of Madras.
('62', 309, 1, 9, 603188) Go in their midst and wean them from drink, teach them the elementary prin ciples of hygiene and sanitation, to which most of them are utter strangers, be it said to our disgrace.
('62', 309, 1, 10, 603368) Having considered that they were beneath our attention, that they were the lowest people on earth, untouchable, unseeable and unapproa chable and so on, we had come to the conclusion that we need not attend to them nor take care of what they were doing.
('62', 309, 1, 11, 603622) They took us at our word and thought they were not human beings, and that they were hardly animals, and so they neglected themselves.
('62', 309, 1, 12, 603756) They simply eked out a miserable existence.
('62', 309, 1, 13, 603800) It is in the midst of these people that you have got to go, and bring to them a ray of light.
('62', 309, 1, 14, 603894) I hope that you will go to these places, and bend your backs and work in their midst, and assure them that you are there not with any mental reservations, nor with any base motives,but with pure motives and serving them with the motive of taking the message of peace and love in their midst.
('62', 309, 1, 15, 604186) If you will do that you will imme diately find that their lives are transformed as also yours.
('62', 309, 1, 16, 604281) I do not ask you to steal a single moment from the hours that you may need for your studies, but I ask you to utilize your idle moments, and I have no doubt that if each of you will examine yourself, you will find that every day you have so many idle moments.
('62', 309, 1, 17, 604541) I do not ask you to give all your moments, but if you will combine and will serve the Harijans in Madras, you will find a revolution in their lives as also in your own lives.
('62', 309, 1, 18, 604716) May God enable you to understand this!
('62', 309, 1, 19, 604755) May God give you the strength to follow this message.
('62', 309, 1, 20, 604809) One thing more I have to tell you.
('62', 309, 1, 21, 604844) I have lodged a complaint against the students of Madras, namely, that, although they claim to be part of India, and not particularly Madras, how can they neglect, especially I say to my sisters, the language that over 22 crores of
('62', 310, 0, 1, 605076) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 311
('62', 310, 1, 2, 605123) Indians understand, namely, Hindi ?
('62', 310, 1, 3, 605159) You have got in Madras the Hindi Prachar Sabha giving you all the facilities to learn Hindi.
('62', 310, 1, 4, 605252) I know that many students have taken advantage of the facilities, but I am sorry to tell you that that is not enough.
('62', 310, 1, 5, 605370) I had expected that your address this time would be presented written in Hindi, and I had also expected that you would call upon me to speak in Hindi.
('62', 310, 1, 6, 605521) But I had to give it up at once.
('62', 310, 1, 7, 605554) I am now engaged in one mission and one mission alone and therefore without taking much of your time and my time on a discourse on Hindi, I began with the burden of my subject.
('62', 310, 1, 8, 605731) I close with this warning that when you begin to take upon your shoulders the burden of the country, you will find what a great handicap you are labouring under if you do not know Hindi or Hin dustani.
('62', 310, 1, 9, 605933) I thank you once more.
('62', 310, 2, 10, 605956) In conclusion, Mahatmaji said that he hoped that the students would relieve him of the burden of the address.
('62', 310, 2, 11, 606066) He would auction the same.
('62', 310, 2, 12, 606093) As no bidders were forthcoming, Mahatmaji said that ladies could also bid giving their jewels.
('62', 310, 2, 13, 606188) He was willing to give away the address for a pair of bangles or a ring.
('62', 310, 2, 14, 606261) Thereupon two ladies in the gathering sent up one bangle each.
('62', 310, 2, 15, 606324) Miss Swaminathan gave away a pair and took away the address.

('62', 310, 4, 18, 606447) December 20, 1933
('62', 310, 5, 19, 606465) DEAR SISTERS, The Reception Committee of the Harijan Sevak Sangh has left very few minutes for me; hence eager though I am to make your acquaintance more fully than I can during the few minutes, I must restrain myself and run away from you after saying a few words.
('62', 310, 5, 20, 606731) It gives me great joy to know that many of you are Harijans sisters.
('62', 310, 5, 21, 606800) If any demonstration was needed, this very meeting is an ocular demons tration; but for the knowledge that some of you are Harijan sisters I at least should not know which are Harijans and which are not.
('62', 310, 5, 22, 607004) It shows that untouchability cannot be God appoin ted institution.
('62', 310, 5, 23, 607071) It is an institution appointed by man at his worst.
('62', 310, 5, 24, 607123) And it is for savarna Hindu men and women to rise in revolt against that institution and blot it out.
('62', 310, 5, 25, 607225) It, therefore, gives me pleasure to receive for the Harijan cause this
('62', 310, 6, 26, 607296) 1 Address on behalf of the Mothers Association and the Harijan women were presented to Gandhiji.
('62', 311, 0, 1, 607393) 312 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('62', 311, 1, 2, 607435) little purse from the Mothers Assocation.
('62', 311, 1, 3, 607477) But I want to say one word now to the Harijan sisters.
('62', 311, 1, 4, 607532) I want them and I want the menfolk among Harijans to play their part nobly in this movement of self purification.
('62', 311, 1, 5, 607646) There are three or four things which undoubtedly demand attention.
('62', 311, 1, 6, 607713) One thing is the observance of the elementary laws of sanitation, purification of the body.
('62', 311, 1, 7, 607805) Those laws you should conform to.
('62', 311, 1, 8, 607839) Then there is the question of carrion eating and beef eating and I know some Harijans take to these evil habits.
('62', 311, 1, 9, 607952) These two things must be given up.
('62', 311, 1, 10, 607987) The fourth thing is not special to Harijans because many so called high class indulge in the bad habit that I am about to mention.
('62', 311, 1, 11, 608118) And that is the drink evil.
('62', 311, 1, 12, 608146) No matter what the so called high class Hindus may or may not do, you, at least, should tell the menfolk; and if you are also given to that habit then you yourself give up that habit altogether.
('62', 311, 1, 13, 608341) Having worked for the last 50 years amongst the poor people and amongst those who are given to drink, I know what I am talking about.
('62', 311, 1, 14, 608475) I saw in Natal, in South Africa, our own sisters dead drunk and wallowing in the gutters.
('62', 311, 1, 15, 608565) When they were dead drunk, they did not know the distinction between good and bad.
('62', 311, 1, 16, 608648) You will, therefore, save yourselves from it if you are addicted to that habit.
('62', 311, 1, 17, 608728) May God give us all, Harijans or not, the strength to follow the message that I am endeavouring to give throughout the length and breadth of India.

('62', 311, 3, 20, 608938) December 20, 1933 This is a wonderful demonstration that you have made of your affection.
('62', 311, 3, 21, 609028) I hope that every one of you realizes the seriousness and magnitude of the mission that I am trying to carry out in the name of God, for His sake and for His forsaken children whom we have come to understand as Harijans.
('62', 311, 3, 22, 609249) There can be, in Gods eyes, no distinc tion between man and man even as there is no distinction between animal and animal.
('62', 311, 3, 23, 609372) Had God designed one part of humanity to be lower than the other.
('62', 311, 3, 24, 609438) He would have put some distinguishing mark upon parts of our bodies whereby these distinctions could have been unmistakbly seen, felt and demonstrated.
('62', 311, 3, 25, 609590) Go where you will from end of India to the other, you will fail,
('62', 311, 4, 26, 609655) 1 The meeting held at Tilak Ghat on the Triplicane Beach was attended by over one lakh people.

('62', 312, 1, 2, 609797) as I have failed, to notice any such distinguishing feature in conn ection with those who call themselves high caste Hindus and those whom high caste Hindus describe as untouchables, invisibles and what not.
('62', 312, 1, 3, 610005) I therefore ask you seriously to consider this urgent question.
('62', 312, 1, 4, 610069) I have said, and I repeat what I have said from a thousand platforms before this vast audience, that if we do not remove root and branch untouchability from our hearts, we are a doomed race, and Hinduism like many other isms, will perish and the discredit will be ours.
('62', 312, 1, 5, 610339) In the midst of this din and noise, I must not put before you the implications of this great movement.
('62', 312, 1, 6, 610442) Suffice it to say that when untouchability is removed from our hearts Harijans will feel the glow of freedom, and then we would treat them as we do our selves, we would know that they have the same rights absolutely and without exception as we have, and that Harijans would be subject to the same discipline that savarna Hindus are.
('62', 312, 1, 7, 610775) If by Gods grace this message reaches your hearts,we shall forget all distinctions of high and low.
('62', 312, 1, 8, 610875) Now I would like you kindly to disperse quietly so that I too can go safely to my car.
('62', 312, 1, 9, 610962) You must kindly go back to your homes.
('62', 312, 1, 10, 611001) The proceedings are finished.

('62', 312, 3, 14, 611152) Remember that little children also have to play their part in this movement of purification.

('62', 313, 1, 4, 611799) For this great movement of self purification, I want men and women to take their full share.
('62', 313, 1, 5, 611892) Let us shed all our vices and bad habits.
('62', 313, 1, 6, 611934) Let us pray to God that He may give us pure minds.
('62', 313, 1, 7, 611985) If any one of you is addicted to carrion eating, give up that bad habit.
('62', 313, 1, 8, 612058) Observe the rules of hygiene and sanitation.
('62', 313, 1, 9, 612103) Educate your children, and give up the drink habit, if you are in the habit of drinking.
('62', 313, 1, 10, 612192) It is one of the greatest enemies of the human race.
('62', 313, 1, 11, 612245) That many savarna Hindu drink spirituous liquors is no reason for Harijans to drink it.
('62', 313, 1, 12, 612333) It is drink that makes men mad and makes them forget the distinction between wife, mother and sister.
('62', 313, 1, 13, 612435) May God give strength to you to go through the process of purification.
('62', 313, 1, 14, 612507) Now, you will excuse me for not giving up more of my time.
('62', 313, 1, 15, 612566) I have still a big programme to carry through.
('62', 313, 1, 16, 612613) Finally, I ask you to give me free passage without any noise.
('62', 313, 1, 17, 612675) I thank you for this magnificent demonstration of your affection and interest that you take in this movement of purification.

('62', 313, 4, 22, 612905) FELLOW LABOURERS, I thank you for the address you have given me.
('62', 313, 4, 23, 612970) If you will make common cause with labour all over India, you ought to be able to understand Hindustani.
('62', 313, 4, 24, 613075) Unless you do that there is no junction between the North and the South.
('62', 313, 4, 25, 613148) But that is not the burden of my mission tonight.
('62', 313, 4, 26, 613198) Tonight I want to tell labour that labour at least should have no distinctions of high and low.
('62', 313, 4, 27, 613294) Having lived in the midst of labour for the last forty years, I know to my great sorrow that among labourers also there are distinctions.
('62', 313, 4, 28, 613432) There are Harijan labourers and non Harijan labourers.
('62', 313, 4, 29, 613487) Even among non Harijan labourers there are distinctions.
('62', 313, 4, 30, 613544) You must forget these distinctions.
('62', 313, 4, 31, 613580) Harijan labour and non Harijan labour are all absolutely one.
('62', 313, 4, 32, 613642) I say to those of you who claim to be Hindus that there is no warrant in religion for untouchability as we observe it today.
('62', 313, 4, 33, 613767) It is impossible that God who is the God of justice could possibly make those distinctions that man observes today in the name

('62', 314, 1, 3, 614051) Lastly, those who are given to carrion eating or beef eat ing should give these up and if labour is to come to its own, you must give up the wretched habits of drink and gambling.
('62', 314, 1, 4, 614231) I know that these two vices have degraded labour and desolated many homes among labourers.
('62', 314, 1, 5, 614322) I therefore hope that you will give up the evil habits of drink and gambling.
('62', 314, 1, 6, 614400) May God give you the strength to shed the evil of untouchability, drink and gambling.

('62', 314, 3, 9, 614519) GARLANDS It is devoutly to be wished that organizers will wean people from presenting me with garlands of flowers.
('62', 314, 3, 10, 614634) If garlands must be presented, they should be of charkha spun, even, strong and fine yarn, which can be used without difficulty for weaving purposes.
('62', 314, 3, 11, 614784) Garlands are not produced without money or, which is the same thing, labour.
('62', 314, 3, 12, 614861) All the money and all the labour available is required for Harijan service.
('62', 314, 3, 13, 614937) And, in any case, I cannot afford to have labour or money spent for my pleasure, vanity or glorification.
('62', 314, 3, 14, 615043) The showering of flowers is an injurious custom.
('62', 314, 3, 15, 615092) The hard stems of yellow flowers, when they are thrown from a distance are calculated to break eye glasses and injure the eyes.
('62', 314, 3, 16, 615220) My eyes have, more than once, narrowly escaped damage from these stems.
('62', 314, 3, 17, 615292) Let the money thus saved be used for adding to the purses collected.
('62', 314, 3, 18, 615361) Indeed, I notice that there is room for economy in most arrangements.
('62', 314, 3, 19, 615431) Motor cars are used too lavishly.
('62', 314, 3, 20, 615465) Only those of the local persons whose presence is necessary should accompany me from place to place.
('62', 314, 3, 21, 615566) Workers are trustees for the Harijan cause, and as such they are expected to guard the Harijan chest with greater care and vigilance than they would bestow upon their own.
('62', 314, 4, 22, 615738) AUCTIONS AND JEWELLERY I have seen a paragraph in a newspaper adversely criticizing my appeal to the women for gifts of jewellery and my auctioning things received as donations.
('62', 314, 4, 23, 615916) Indeed, I would like the thousands of sisters who attend my meetings to give me most, if not all, of the jewellery they wear.
('62', 314, 4, 24, 616042) In this country of semi starvation of millions and insuffi cient nutrition of practically eighty percent of the people, the wearing of jewellery is an offence to the eye.
('62', 314, 4, 25, 616213) A woman in India has rarely any
('62', 315, 0, 1, 616245) 316 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('62', 315, 1, 2, 616287) cash which she can call her own.
('62', 315, 1, 3, 616320) But the jewellery she wears does belong to her, though even that she will not, dare not, give away, without the consent of her lord and master.
('62', 315, 1, 4, 616464) It ennobles her to part with, for a good cause, something she calls her own.
('62', 315, 1, 5, 616541) Moreover, most of this jewellery has no pretension to art, some of it is positively ugly and a harbinger of dirt.
('62', 315, 1, 6, 616655) Such are anklets, heavy necklaces, clasps worn not for adjusting the hair, but purely as a decoration for unkempt, unwashed and often evil smelling hair, or row upon row of bangles from wrist to elbow.
('62', 315, 1, 7, 616857) In my opinion, the wearing of expensive jewellery is a distinct loss to the country.
('62', 315, 1, 8, 616942) It is so much capital locked up or, worse still, allowed to wear away.
('62', 315, 1, 9, 617013) And in this movement of self purification, the surrender of jewellery by women or men I hold to be a distinct benefit to society.
('62', 315, 1, 10, 617143) Those who give do so gladly.
('62', 315, 1, 11, 617172) My invariable condition is that on no account should the jewellery donated be replaced.
('62', 315, 1, 12, 617260) Indeed, women have blessed me for inducing them to part with things which had enslaved them.
('62', 315, 1, 13, 617353) And in not a few cases men have thanked me for being an instrument for bringing simpli city into their homes.
('62', 315, 1, 14, 617463) Now a word about auctions.
('62', 315, 1, 15, 617490) I have seen nothing wrong about them.
('62', 315, 1, 16, 617528) They set up a healthy rivalry and are an innocent method of evoking the generous impulse in man or woman for a noble cause.
('62', 315, 1, 17, 617652) I have resorted to the method now for years without ever noticing the slightest civil effect produced by these auctions.
('62', 315, 1, 18, 617773) Why is it wrong to pay a price beyond its intrinsic value for an article which one prizes, even though it be as a memento, if it is not wrong to pay fabulous prices for worn out manuscripts of authors reputed to be great ?
('62', 315, 1, 19, 617996) Surely, the price of an article is what a man voluntarily pays for it.
('62', 315, 1, 20, 618067) And let it be remembered that people who bid at my auctions do not pay fancy prices for pleasing me.
('62', 315, 1, 21, 618168) I know they do not.
('62', 315, 1, 22, 618188) I can recall occasions when I have not been able to induce bids, even though the audiences have been otherwise as enthusiastic or responsive as anywhere else.
('62', 315, 2, 23, 618347) ABUSE OF FASTING Cases of abuse of fasting have recently come under my observation.
('62', 315, 2, 24, 618431) One person wrote threatening to fast if I did not send my autograph, three if I did not visit their places during the tour and another if his village did not produce Rs. 5,000 for khadi, Harijan and kindred constructive activities.
('62', 315, 2, 25, 618663) I have no doubt that all these are instances of abuse of fasting.
('62', 315, 2, 26, 618729) Why should I give my autograph, or visit
('62', 316, 0, 1, 618770) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 317
('62', 316, 1, 2, 618817) a place or workers find money under threat of a fast ?
('62', 316, 1, 3, 618872) There should be a moral obligation on the one against whom a fast is taken.
('62', 316, 1, 4, 618948) Fasts are legitimately taken in the interest of some public good or for doing service to those for whom they are taken.
('62', 316, 1, 5, 619068) I am well aware that the dividing line between use and abuse is often too thin to be noticeable.
('62', 316, 1, 6, 619165) The better test, therefore, perhaps is whether the person fasting has undergone the requisite discipline for taking fasts calculated to influence conduct other than his own.
('62', 316, 1, 7, 619339) In the cases quoted, so far as I can see, there was utter absence of qualification or previous pre paration.
('62', 316, 1, 8, 619448) Moreover, legitimate fasts, even if repeated by many, should be capable of response.
('62', 316, 1, 9, 619533) In the cases under consideration, if a thousand persons asked for my autograph, or a thousand workers in a thousand village desired my visit to their places or a worker required poor people to pay the money he wanted, it is clear that response might easily be a physical impossibility.

('62', 316, 3, 12, 619882) December 22, 1933
('62', 316, 4, 13, 619900) FRIENDS, Up to now we have done no business.
('62', 316, 4, 14, 619945) What has happened is, the precious few minutes that are at my disposal have been taken away in the reading of addresses.
('62', 316, 4, 15, 620066) Therefore, before I get the right to speak to you, I must do some business.
('62', 316, 4, 16, 620142) (Laughter) I must ask you now to dispossess me of all these trinkets that have been given to me and exchange them for pure gold.
('62', 316, 4, 17, 620271) (Renewed laughter) Then, I cannot be guilty of stealing away this diamond ring; and I shall, therefore, have to offer it to you.
('62', 316, 4, 18, 620400) I shall now begin the business portion of the meeting.
('62', 316, 5, 19, 620455) Gandhiji then spoke a few words in Hindi, thanking both the donors and the successful bidders for the help they had thus rendered for the cause of the Harijans.
('62', 316, 5, 20, 620616) This was a great punyakaryam 2 , he said; and in such acts of service, they must feel a
('62', 316, 6, 21, 620704) He exhorted them to remove from their hearts notions of high and low because of birth.
('62', 316, 6, 22, 620791) Untouchability, he reiterated, was a great sin; and whoever made a resolve to rid his heart of this impurity of treating a certain section of his brothers as untouchables was really a better man.
('62', 316, 6, 23, 620987) Gandhiji then explained in a few words why he called untouchables Harijans.
('62', 316, 6, 24, 621063) He had learnt in Tamil a great saying
('62', 316, 7, 25, 621101) 1 Gandhiji then auctioned the articles presented to him.
('62', 316, 7, 26, 621158) Several ladies offered him jewellery.
('62', 316, 7, 27, 621196) 2 Meritorious act

('62', 317, 2, 3, 621340) Harijan as applied to this class of unfortunate people.
('62', 317, 2, 4, 621396) It was not his own coining; it was an untouchable who persuaded him to use it.
('62', 317, 2, 5, 621475) He then concluded with an appeal to their hearts to cleanse their religion by removing the blot of untouchability.
('62', 317, 2, 6, 621590) This is a great yajna; and and I wish to God that He gives you wisdom to take your proper place therein.

('62', 317, 4, 9, 621754) December 22, 1933 Now I proceed to business.
('62', 317, 4, 10, 621799) You people go to far off lands exploiting people and amassing wealth.
('62', 317, 4, 11, 621869) I am now going to exploit you.
('62', 317, 5, 12, 621900) The audience greeted this statement with laughter and cheers.
('62', 317, 5, 13, 621962) Putting up for auction an ivory casket, Gandhiji said : What will you give for this ?
('62', 317, 6, 14, 622048) The first bid for the casket which would be worth roughly Rs. 15, was Rs. 101 by Mr. Ramnath Goenka.
('62', 317, 6, 15, 622149) Get along, Rs. 101 is nothing for you, Gujaratis assembled here.
('62', 317, 7, 16, 622214) Rs. 201 was the next bid.
('62', 317, 7, 17, 622240) Shall I let it go .
('62', 317, 7, 18, 622260) Once, .
('62', 317, 7, 19, 622268) twice, .
('62', 317, 7, 20, 622277) I will not yet say thrice .
('62', 317, 7, 21, 622305) There is yet time.
('62', 317, 7, 22, 622324) A few hundred is nothing to you.
('62', 317, 7, 23, 622357) You know I have come on a mission of reform.
('62', 317, 7, 24, 622402) It is the cause of Truth, as I see it, and I appeal to you to help in it.
('62', 317, 7, 25, 622476) The purse you have presented me is a poor one compared to what you can afford.
('62', 317, 8, 26, 622555) Proceeding, Gandhiji said that the work of Harijan uplift he was now engaged in was a sacred one.
('62', 317, 8, 27, 622653) So far as he could understand the spirit of the Vedas, he saw nothing to warrant distinctions of high and low, touchable and untouchable.
('62', 317, 8, 28, 622791) In the eyes of God, according to true advaita 3, all men were equal.
('62', 317, 8, 29, 622860) It was only maya that made them see such distinctions between man and man.
('62', 317, 8, 30, 622935) They must no longer consider their fellow men as untouchable or unseeable.
('62', 317, 8, 31, 623010) Could any man say that his head or eye or ear was superior to his hand or feet or any other part of his body ?
('62', 317, 8, 32, 623121) All were equally important.
('62', 317, 8, 33, 623149) Similarly every section of society was important as any other and they must look on all men as equal.
('62', 317, 8, 34, 623251) He saw nothing in this doctrine that was against the dictates of dharma.
('62', 317, 8, 35, 623324) He had full confidence that the work he was carrying on was Gods
('62', 317, 9, 36, 623389) 1 God is the help of the helpless. 2 The Gujarati, Marwari and Sindhi residents welcomed Gandhiji at 9.30 a.

('62', 318, 1, 3, 623599) He prayed to God to confer prosperity on them and he appealed to them to utilize their wealth in the service of Truth and their fellow men.

('62', 318, 3, 6, 623798) MADRAS December 22, 1933 Since ancient times, we have been taught that before God, elephant and ant, Brahmin and Shudra are alike.
('62', 318, 3, 7, 623929) So also are they alike before a samadarshi 2 or seer.
('62', 318, 3, 8, 623983) What a pundit or sage does, a prakrit or man of the world should do.
('62', 318, 3, 9, 624052) Religious injunction is the same for both.
('62', 318, 3, 10, 624095) You cannot teach truth to a pundit and untruth to a prakrit man.
('62', 318, 3, 11, 624160) Vaishyas believe that untruth will do in business.
('62', 318, 3, 12, 624211) But this is not what the Shastras or dharma teaches.
('62', 318, 3, 13, 624264) In the universal religion, there is neither high nor low.
('62', 318, 3, 14, 624322) The distinction between high and low is the root of all our sorrows.
('62', 318, 3, 15, 624391) The abolition of untoucha bility is a shuddhiyajna 3
('62', 318, 4, 16, 624444) for Hindus.
('62', 318, 4, 17, 624456) What you gave today is your share in the shuddhiyajana and is the earnest money of your pratijna.
('62', 318, 5, 18, 624554) You ask me whether purification can come from inner or outer forces.
('62', 318, 5, 19, 624623) The question is well put.
('62', 318, 5, 20, 624649) Purification by outer means is valueless.
('62', 318, 5, 21, 624691) If I forced you to bow to me, it would be against dharma.
('62', 318, 5, 22, 624749) It is only by the inner effort that religious objects can be achieved.
('62', 318, 5, 23, 624820) I beseech you to do that willingly today, which you will be compelled to do hereafter.

('62', 318, 9, 27, 624999) After unveiling the portrait, Gandhiji said that Mr. Nageswara Rao Pantulu in flesh and blood was different from Nageswara Rao Pantulu in canvas.

('62', 319, 1, 3, 625629) Ever since he had known Mr. Pantulu he had one speciality about him and that was that Mr. Pantulu always believed in giving himself away to those who needed him or his help.
('62', 319, 1, 4, 625803) Mr. Nageswara Rao Pantulu had told him that the bulk of the profits he made from Amrutanjan 1 went to the relief of the distressed, to help those who were in need.
('62', 319, 1, 5, 625967) Mr. Nageswara Rao Pantulu had absolutely no other purpose.
('62', 319, 1, 6, 626026) Mahatmaji prayed that Mr. Nageswara Rao Pantulu might continue to evolve from step to step till at last everybody could go to him and get comfort and help.
('62', 319, 1, 7, 626182) They must all translate in their own lives all the noble qualities that they found in or imputed to Mr. Nageswara Rao Pantulu.

('62', 319, 3, 10, 626380) MADRAS, December 22, 1933
('62', 319, 4, 11, 626406) After apologizing to the graduates and pracharaks 3 for his inability, due to pressure of time, to hand over to them their respective degrees in person, he assured them of his congratulations and blessings.
('62', 319, 4, 12, 626613) He had very little by way of advice to give them for what there was to say had already been said by Mr. Tripathi.
('62', 319, 4, 13, 626727) 4 But one point he would like to emphaizeabout the need for following that advice.
('62', 319, 4, 14, 626810) Hindi prachar in South India, and as he had seen, more particularly in Andhradesha, had made steady progress; but he would not be satisfied unless Hindi was understood by everyone to such an extent that not one would desire him to speak in English.
('62', 319, 4, 15, 627059) His appeal to them was to push on with their work with courage and determination.
('62', 319, 4, 16, 627141) They had started well and he hoped they would carry it on.
('62', 319, 4, 17, 627200) It was stated that Hindi presented some peculiar difficulties to people of these parts of India.
('62', 319, 4, 18, 627297) Perhaps this was true to some extent.
('62', 319, 4, 19, 627335) But he felt no Indian language would present any insurmountable difficulty to an Indian.
('62', 319, 4, 20, 627424) There was an element of Sanskrit common to all Indian languages which, so far as he could see, should make it very easy for them to gain at least a working knowledge of any Indian language.
('62', 319, 4, 21, 627614) They found no difficulty whatever in mastering a foreign language like English or even such difficult languages as Tamil.
('62', 319, 4, 22, 627736) Why should Hindi, therefore, present any great difficulty to them ?
('62', 319, 4, 23, 627804) It was the language of 22 out of the 35 crores of Indias population, and it was bound to be the common language of India.
('62', 319, 4, 24, 627926) It was stated by some, Gandhiji said, that Muslims could not understand Hindi and they understood only Urdu.
('62', 319, 4, 25, 628035) But he could see no difference between Hindi and Urdu as they obtained among common folk.
('62', 319, 4, 26, 628125) In Islamic books and a section of Muslims, it was true that a large percentage of Persian and Arabic words were employed thus

('62', 320, 1, 2, 628546) rendering Urdu difficult for Hindus to understand.
('62', 320, 1, 3, 628597) Similarly, some Hindus also use a large percentage of Sanskrit words in their books and conversation, making them difficult for Muslims to comprehend.
('62', 320, 1, 4, 628748) But when he talked of Hindu and Urdu being identical he was not referring to this kind of Hindi or Urdu.
('62', 320, 1, 5, 628853) He referred to only the language in vogue among common folk in North India, which contained a good mixture of Sanskrit, Persian and Arabic words and still was understood by everyone, Hindu or Muslim.
('62', 320, 1, 6, 629053) It was this language he wanted every one of them to learn to understand and speak.
('62', 320, 1, 7, 629136) Unless they did this, he was afraid people from the South could not touch the heart of the masses in the North and vice versa.
('62', 320, 2, 8, 629263) The Hindi Prachar Sabha, he said, had been working in Dakshin Bharat for over fifteen years and yet, he asked, what had people done to avail themselves of its services and, by learning the language, to promote Indian national unity ?
('62', 320, 2, 9, 629497) Did they not find time and money to waste on the races, cinemas and amusements ?
('62', 320, 2, 10, 629578) Could they not spare a part of these for the learning of Hindi ?
('62', 320, 2, 11, 629643) He had heard the Sabha was in need of adequate accommodation and had been trying to acquire buildings of its own but could not for want of funds.
('62', 320, 2, 12, 629789) If everyone came forward to learn the language paying a small sum for the Sabhas services the necessary money could easily be found and the Sabha need not continue expecting help from Northern India.
('62', 320, 2, 13, 629989) It was the duty of South India to make the Sabha self dependent.
('62', 320, 2, 14, 630054) He would therefore repeat his appeal that South Indians must one and all avail themselves of the Sabhas services and help in this national work.
('62', 320, 3, 15, 630199) The Hindu, 23 12 1933
('62', 320, 4, 16, 630221) 352. REPLY TO DEPRESSED CLASSES DEPUTATION 2
('62', 320, 5, 17, 630266) MADRAS, December 22, 1933 Come in Rao Bahadur.
('62', 320, 5, 18, 630313) Can I give you a chair ?
('62', 320, 5, 19, 630338) Now, Rao Bahadur, I have got your letter.
('62', 320, 5, 20, 630380) Shall we begin with it ?
('62', 320, 5, 21, 630405) Or what shall we do ?
('62', 320, 5, 22, 630427) Just as you would regulate the proceedings.
('62', 320, 5, 23, 630471) Will you permit its reading ? Mr. Srinivasan submitted.
('62', 320, 5, 24, 630527) Gandhiji said : Yes, you please.
('62', 320, 5, 25, 630560) Mr. Bashyam Iyengar threw out a hint that the letter consisted of six typed pages.
('62', 320, 5, 26, 630643) It all depends on Mr. Srinivasan, who is the Chairman here.
('62', 320, 5, 27, 630703) But so far as I am concerned, I have read it from top to bottom.
('62', 320, 6, 28, 630768) 1 Gandhiji then auctioned the shawl, the convocation robe, which had been presented to him at the beginning of the proceedings.
('62', 320, 6, 29, 630896) 2 The executive of the Madras Depressed Classes Federation waited in deputation on Gandhiji in the evening.
('62', 320, 6, 30, 631004) The deputation consisted of R. Srinivasan, V. Dharmalingam Pillai, Swami Sahajananda, P. V. Rajagopala Pillai and Pushparaj.
('62', 320, 6, 31, 631129) Others present were; V. Bashyam Iyengar, President of the Provincial Board of Servants of Untouchables Society, K. Nageswara Rao Pantulu, V. Venkatasubbiah, K. Bashyam and R. V. Sastri, Editor, Harijan.
('62', 321, 0, 1, 631332) 322 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('62', 321, 1, 2, 631374) Mr. Srinivasan suggested that it might be allowed to be read for the benefit of his colleagues as there was hardly time to circulate it to them.
('62', 321, 1, 3, 631519) Gandhiji asked Mr. Pushparaj to go ahead.
('62', 321, 1, 4, 631561) You will excuse me, If I am not attending to it.
('62', 321, 1, 5, 631610) Because, I have almost got it by heart.
('62', 321, 1, 6, 631650) In the mean time, I shall be putting my papers in order.
('62', 321, 1, 7, 631707) 1 The best thing would be for me to take up point after point and deal with it.
('62', 321, 1, 8, 631787) What you say about the Poona Pact is common ground between us; and I entirely endorse the view that if savarna Hindus do not work the Pact in the manner it is intended it should be, it can become nugatory and of no benefit whatsoever.
('62', 321, 1, 9, 632022) 2 I will admit that in its entirety.
('62', 321, 1, 10, 632059) How far the Central Board at Delhi or the Provincial Boards will be able directly to affect the elections, I do not know.
('62', 321, 1, 11, 632181) I think it is a very difficult and delicate subject.
('62', 321, 1, 12, 632234) Therefore what I have directed is that with these elections generally we should not interfere.
('62', 321, 1, 13, 632329) But we do interfere where injustice is done to a Harijan candidate.
('62', 321, 1, 14, 632397) When that happens, as it did in Bombay, we try to set it right.
('62', 321, 2, 15, 632461) Gandhiji related the Bombay incident at some length and mentioned his efforts in effecting the withdrawal of the candidate (for election to the Legislative Council) who had ranged himself against one who was a member of the Servants of India Society, uniformly known to be decisively friendly to Harijan interests.
('62', 321, 2, 16, 632776) In Delhi there was the danger of the Harijan candidate not being elected to the Municipality.
('62', 321, 2, 17, 632870) We intervened and room was specially made for the Harijan candidate.
('62', 321, 2, 18, 632939) In Cawnpore, there was a Harijan candidate and it was wrong for savarna Hindus to have opposed him.
('62', 321, 2, 19, 633039) I came to know about it after the election.
('62', 321, 2, 20, 633083) The gentleman who was defeated wrote to me; and I replied that it was wrong on the part of the savarna rival to have so ranged himself against the Harijan candidate.
('62', 321, 2, 21, 633249) We tried our best to get this gentleman resign his seat.
('62', 321, 2, 22, 633306) At that time it was not successful.
('62', 321, 2, 23, 633342) What has since happened I do not know.
('62', 321, 2, 24, 633381) There are other instances, as well.
('62', 321, 2, 25, 633417) I give these instances to show that where there is a Harijan candidate, whose bonafides is not impeached in any manner whatsoever, the Central Board have tried to influence the savarna Hindu candidates to withdraw from the contest.
('62', 321, 2, 26, 633649) But where Harijan candidates are opposed to one another, or when savarna Hindus are
('62', 321, 3, 27, 633733) 1 The letter was then read out and Gandhiji gave the reply.
('62', 321, 3, 28, 633793) 2 The deputationists had apprehended that the Yeravda Pact would not be effective in view of caste Hindus tactics and unfair methods and that they could be prevented from electing men of their choice.
('62', 322, 0, 1, 633994) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 323
('62', 322, 1, 2, 634041) conducting the elections, the Board does not interferewhich you really want the Board to do.
('62', 322, 1, 3, 634134) You desire that the Board should so regulate the elections or so influence the elections, as to have the right type of men elected.
('62', 322, 1, 4, 634266) But, I think, the Board will then lose its influence.
('62', 322, 1, 5, 634320) Today the Board is daily rising in influence, because of its absolute neutrality except where, as I said, a Harijan stands to suffer.
('62', 322, 1, 6, 634454) That is the line of demarcation we have placed.
('62', 322, 1, 7, 634502) If you examine the situation, I have no doubt you will agree with me.
('62', 322, 1, 8, 634572) If you want to make this Board an effective instrument of service, it must keep itself apart and aloof from politics, and when the level of our character rises and the root that lies at the heart of untouchability is affected and expelled, there would be levelling up of everything all along the line.
('62', 322, 1, 9, 634874) That is my hope.
('62', 322, 1, 10, 634891) But with these lapses of mere moral character, the Central Board should not interfere.
('62', 322, 1, 11, 634978) Once we endeavour to do that, I think, you would find that the whole of the structure will fall to pieces.
('62', 322, 1, 12, 635085) The Board is absolutely unaffected by politics; and, as I have so often said, the Harijan movement is purely religious.
('62', 322, 1, 13, 635205) If I succeed in doing so, and If the Board accepts that policy in all sincerity and works it out earnestly, you will find nothing better for our purpose.
('62', 322, 1, 14, 635359) The movement will become purer, and the Board would be wiser and achieve its ends quicker for its aloofness and abstention from direct intervention in politics.
('62', 322, 2, 15, 635520) Passing on to the next point raised in Mr. Srinivasans letter, namely, economic condition of Depressed Classes and the removal of untouchability, in general, through the instrumentality of the Government, Mahatma Gandhi said that he totally agreed with themthat the Board should not do a single act which would interfere with the encouragement afforded by the Government; and the Board, he assured, would not do it, no matter what views he held in connection with the Government.
('62', 322, 2, 16, 636000) There is no doubt I have been holding very strong views against the present system of government.
('62', 322, 2, 17, 636098) It is a mischievious system, taking the interests of India as a whole.
('62', 322, 2, 18, 636169) But I cannot possibly apply that doctrine in connection with Harijans, unless I would so throw myself in the turmoil and resist the Government, there also.
('62', 322, 2, 19, 636325) I cannot do it.
('62', 322, 2, 20, 636341) I say, honestly, I could not possibly resist doing it, if the Harijans were capable of looking after themselves, as you [Mr. Srini vasan] are and as Mr. Pushparaj is.
('62', 322, 2, 21, 636508) That is, so far as you individuals are concerned.
('62', 322, 2, 22, 636558) Taken as a mass they are absolutely helpless.
('62', 322, 2, 23, 636604) When they can help themselves, stand equal to savarna Hindus and brush
('62', 323, 0, 1, 636675) 324 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('62', 323, 1, 2, 636717) shoulders with them, I shall be at ease and then say : No; I cannot look to your interests. That I cannot possibly do.
('62', 323, 1, 3, 636836) Let them take all the advantage they can from the Govern ment and let them take all the advantage they can from the savarna Hindus.
('62', 323, 1, 4, 636968) The two mixed together will enable them to redress the balance somewhat.
('62', 323, 1, 5, 637041) Even then, I do not believe they would be able to redress the balance because this crushing down that has gone on for ages is not going to be lifted off entirely in a few years, no matter what atonement is done by savarna Hindus.
('62', 323, 1, 6, 637271) It would take a long time before the Harijans come to their own and feel they are just as good as they might be.
('62', 323, 1, 7, 637384) I can give you this absolute assurance that I shall never interfere with the policy of the Government in so far as the Harijans are concerned.
('62', 323, 1, 8, 637527) Here also I will say I am conducting this tour in a manner so as to disarm all suspicion; and I will never take advantage of the Harijan movement in order to further the aims of the Civil Disobedience Movement.
('62', 323, 1, 9, 637738) It would then not be civil but criminal.
('62', 323, 1, 10, 637779) I do not ask your word of certicate.
('62', 323, 1, 11, 637816) But I do say that I have never had any criminal intention in all my life.
('62', 323, 1, 12, 637890) In order to justify that civil nature, I am keeping this Harijan cause apart.
('62', 323, 1, 13, 637968) If, on the other hand, I wanted to use it for a political purpose, I would not have hesitated to make an open declaration that of course, I am going to use the Harijans for conducting the civil resistance movement.
('62', 323, 1, 14, 638183) No; emphatically no.
('62', 323, 1, 15, 638204) On the contrary, those Harijans who are living with me, and who, according to their declarations, owe their all to their association with me, pleaded with me to allow them to join the movement, when I was disbanding the Ashram.
('62', 323, 1, 16, 638432) Why do you keep us aloof ?
('62', 323, 1, 17, 638459) Are we less patriotic and less capable of offering resistance ? You dare not do it, I warned, because, I said, you, as represen tatives of Harijans, would be putting yourselves in the wrong. The Servants of Untouchables Society is today under the control of men who cannot afford to offer civil resistance.
('62', 323, 1, 18, 638766) Messrs A. V. Thakkar and G. D. Birla are the moving spirits there.
('62', 323, 1, 19, 638833) Not only that; all Congressmen, who have got this civil resistance in them and wanted to do so, are also prohibited from taking office in the Central Board, Provincial Boards or any of their branches.
('62', 323, 1, 20, 639034) There still remains one question as to the activities of the Society and its relationship with the Government.
('62', 323, 1, 21, 639145) There again, I would say, Do not put that weight on the Board.
('62', 323, 1, 22, 639208) If you do that, it would lose its
('62', 324, 0, 1, 639242) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 325
('62', 324, 1, 2, 639289) universal influence.
('62', 324, 1, 3, 639310) I want the Board to have a universal influence and its influence felt effectively everywhere.
('62', 324, 1, 4, 639404) In matters you have men tioned, the Board will never interfere with the Government.
('62', 324, 1, 5, 639488) The government may even adopt measures that may be harmful.
('62', 324, 1, 6, 639548) Then it will be for you to put your foot down.
('62', 324, 1, 7, 639595) We should not do it.
('62', 324, 1, 8, 639616) There again I endorse what you [Mr. Srinivasan] have said in your letter.
('62', 324, 1, 9, 639690) In your politics also you say you must be allowed to develop along your own lines.
('62', 324, 1, 10, 639773) I entirely grant it.
('62', 324, 1, 11, 639794) There will be no interference on the part of the Board.
('62', 324, 1, 12, 639850) So then, when the Governments policy is questionable in connection with Harijans interests, it will be for you and for you alone to decide whether to resist it, even by constitutional and legitimate means.
('62', 324, 1, 13, 640056) But so far as the Board is concerned, I will say, We have drawn the line of demarcation and there we stand. If they do stand, I know the Board will command the respect of the Govern ment also.
('62', 324, 1, 14, 640249) So all along the line, they will be acting on the squareall right angles and no acute angle.
('62', 324, 1, 15, 640342) Now, to education.
('62', 324, 1, 16, 640361) 1 On this subject, I think the Central Board can present you with an absolutely good record.
('62', 324, 1, 17, 640454) Everywhere scholarships are being given freely.
('62', 324, 1, 18, 640502) So many hundreds of Harijans are now in receipt of scholarships which they cannot get from the Government or any other agency.
('62', 324, 1, 19, 640629) We never say to a single person : Do not go to the Government. That is not a policy which is applicable to this Board.
('62', 324, 1, 20, 640748) We encourage them to seek assistance from the Government departments.
('62', 324, 1, 21, 640818) Where there was not enough, the Board supplemented it, We have done it in so many cases.
('62', 324, 1, 22, 640907) That is our policy in connection with education.
('62', 324, 1, 23, 640956) Then, ah!
('62', 324, 1, 24, 640966) you say that repatriation is the result of my activities in South Africa.
('62', 324, 1, 25, 641040) 2 That is a very unkind cut.
('62', 324, 1, 26, 641069) (Laughter) I say that history will give a different verdict.
('62', 324, 1, 27, 641130) When I landed on the South African soil in the year 1893, repatriation was on the anvil.
('62', 324, 1, 28, 641219) Do you know that a Bill was actually passed in the Natal Legislative whereby every Indian, who after finishing his indenture wanted to settle in Natal, was requiredto do what ?
('62', 324, 2, 29, 641396) 1 The deputationists had complained that the policy of admitting Harijan children into common schools, where caste Hindus predominated, was not working well and was not conducive to the educational progress of the Depressed Classes.
('62', 324, 2, 30, 641629) They sought Gandhijis help in raising funds for scholarships, stipends and for establishing hostels.
('62', 324, 2, 31, 641730) 2 The deputationists had stated that those who had been repatriated from South Africa as a result of Gandhijis work were undergoing great suffering and hardship for want of employment.
('62', 325, 0, 1, 641915) 326 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('62', 325, 1, 2, 641957) MR. R. SRINIVASAN : Pay poll tax.
('62', 325, 2, 3, 641991) GANDHIJI : How much ?
('62', 325, 3, 4, 642013) MR. SRINIVASAN :  1 a head.
('62', 325, 3, 5, 642041) No fear.
('62', 325, 3, 6, 642050) They stipulated  25. I resisted it.
('62', 325, 3, 7, 642086) The original intention was that after indenture had been finished, they must go back.
('62', 325, 3, 8, 642172) That is to say, indenture should expire in India.
('62', 325, 3, 9, 642222) I promoted petitions in the Natal Parliament.
('62', 325, 3, 10, 642268) I did it through the mercantile community, as it was not possible for me to do it through indivi dual Indians at that time.
('62', 325, 3, 11, 642392) The provisions were altered in conse quence; and that is a matter of record.
('62', 325, 3, 12, 642469) Therefore you will see, historically, repatriation was taking place when I went to South Africa; and on my going there, it became impossible.
('62', 325, 3, 13, 642611) You then express your fear that this untouchability movement may end as the movement in South Africa ended.
('62', 325, 3, 14, 642719) I wish it ended like that.
('62', 325, 3, 15, 642746) (Loud laughter) Repatriation is now voluntary and repatriates get money compensation.
('62', 325, 3, 16, 642832) In 1893, it was involuntary and compulsory without any compensation whatsoever.
('62', 325, 3, 17, 642912) If that was the crime I have committed(Renewed laughter)I plead guilty.
('62', 325, 4, 18, 642984) Winding up this part of the discussion, Gandhiji said that the scheme of repatriation had proved a failure.
('62', 325, 4, 19, 643092) He knew it was a failure because he was in correspondence with those who could speak with direct knowledge in South Africa.
('62', 325, 4, 20, 643216) He was guiding Indians there to the extent he could; and warning them against coming to India where they would be outcastes even among outcastes.
('62', 325, 4, 21, 643362) In these circumstances, he said, he had nothing to repent for, in regard to South Africa.
('62', 325, 4, 22, 643452) Let me now come to the temple entry question; and I will at once say that I accept your point.
('62', 325, 4, 23, 643547) 1 If you say you do not want it at all, I agree.
('62', 325, 4, 24, 643596) But it is due to the savarna Hindus to say, Come to our temples.
('62', 325, 4, 25, 643661) They are as much open to you as they are to us.
('62', 325, 4, 26, 643709) It is entirely your choice whether you will enter or not.
('62', 325, 4, 27, 643767) I do not invite Harijans to take part in this agitation for temple entry.
('62', 325, 4, 28, 643841) But you can signify your approval, if you wanted, that this is also your right, but you may not exercise it.
('62', 325, 4, 29, 643950) Or you may take a different attitude.
('62', 325, 4, 30, 643988) That is entirely for you to consider.
('62', 325, 4, 31, 644026) But so far as I am concerned, it is simply a one sided thing.
('62', 325, 4, 32, 644088) It is a matter of repentance for savarna Hindus and a change of heart.
('62', 325, 4, 33, 644159) You are entitled to come to those places which you consider to be our sanctuaries.
('62', 325, 4, 34, 644242) You have just as much right as any savarna Hindu.
('62', 325, 4, 35, 644292) When that right is recognized, it is for you to exercise that right or not.
('62', 325, 5, 36, 644368) About the drink evil, Gandhiji said that he was always circumspect and careful
('62', 325, 6, 37, 644447) 1 The deputationists had stated that they were not opposed to temple entry but it was not advisable for them to take active part in the movement.

('62', 326, 1, 2, 644640) in offering advice to this community.
('62', 326, 1, 3, 644678) 1 He was aware that it was prevalent among other communities.
('62', 326, 1, 4, 644740) But only the Harijans, who were under the great handicap of having to fight uphill, could not afford it.
('62', 326, 1, 5, 644845) They had got to be, like Caesars wife, above suspicion.
('62', 326, 1, 6, 644901) The savarna Hindus may wallow in lakes of red water; but you must fly away from it.
('62', 326, 1, 7, 644985) I do not, however, want to wound your susceptibilities.
('62', 326, 1, 8, 645041) I tell you, gentlemen like you may take it amiss; but the large body of Harijans dont.
('62', 326, 1, 9, 645128) After all, you and I know that I have been working in their midst for years and years in order to wean them from drink.
('62', 326, 1, 10, 645248) Therefore, I think you ought not to seek to restrict my freedom.
('62', 326, 1, 11, 645313) You can certainly warn me; and I accept itshall shape my language in such a manner that it does not offend any person whatsoever; and you may take it from me that I would not say a single word to offend anybody.
('62', 326, 1, 12, 645525) Lastly to the name Harijan.
('62', 326, 1, 13, 645553) You say that the Depressed Classes were not consulted.
('62', 326, 1, 14, 645608) They consulted me.
('62', 326, 1, 15, 645627) That is the point.
('62', 326, 1, 16, 645646) (Laughter) I have visited all parts of India.
('62', 326, 1, 17, 645692) Why are we called Harijans? I am asked.
('62', 326, 1, 18, 645732) Why should they not have a better name ?
('62', 326, 1, 19, 645773) That is the generality of feeling.
('62', 326, 1, 20, 645808) For Heavens sake do not call us coolies, they pleaded.
('62', 326, 1, 21, 645863) At one time this word had a particular significance.
('62', 326, 1, 22, 645916) A whole race was called by that name.
('62', 326, 1, 23, 645954) If it was not now used it does not mean there has come about a change of heart.
('62', 326, 1, 24, 646034) The offence to the ear has been removed.
('62', 326, 1, 25, 646075) That is what the new name has achieved.
('62', 326, 1, 26, 646115) It is not, as I said, my coining.
('62', 326, 1, 27, 646149) An untouchable pleaded with me not to be known by an expressioon of eternal reproach.
('62', 326, 1, 28, 646235) Depressed or Suppressed reminded them of slavery, he very rightly said.
('62', 326, 1, 29, 646307) I have no name to suggest; will you suggest? I asked.
('62', 326, 1, 30, 646361) Then the man suggested Harijan.
('62', 326, 1, 31, 646393) He quoted in support from Narasinh Mehta, the Gujarati poet who had used it in his works.
('62', 326, 1, 32, 646483) I jumped at it.
('62', 326, 1, 33, 646499) I knew also the Tamil saying Dikkatravarukku deivame tunai.
('62', 326, 1, 34, 646559) Is not Harijan a paraphrase of it ?
('62', 326, 1, 35, 646595) They are Gods chosen, who are outcastes.
('62', 326, 1, 36, 646636) That is what Harijan signifies as applied to suppressed classes.
('62', 326, 1, 37, 646701) The certificate you have given in the last paragraph of your letter 2 is too early for me.
('62', 326, 1, 38, 646792) You all have listened to what I have had to
('62', 326, 2, 39, 646836) 1 The deputationists had complained that there were several communities which were addicted to drink and other evil habits and, therefore, to stigmatize the Depressed Classes alone was unfair and unjust.
('62', 326, 2, 40, 647040) 2 The deputationists had thanked Gandhiji for starting an unprecedented movement in the cause of their community which had given a great impetus to the caste Hindus to banish untouchability, and wished his mission a successful end.

('62', 327, 1, 3, 647340) We shall all work together with the same end in view.
('62', 327, 1, 4, 647394) I am sure God is with us; and therefore success is assured.
('62', 327, 1, 5, 647454) I have no misgivings at all.
('62', 327, 1, 6, 647483) I know untouchability is dying.
('62', 327, 1, 7, 647515) To me the monster seems to be still taking a few breaths; but they are last breaths.
('62', 327, 1, 8, 647600) (Loud applause)
('62', 327, 2, 9, 647616) MR. R. SRINIVASAN: I hope so.

('62', 327, 5, 13, 647725) MADRAS, December 22, 1933
('62', 327, 6, 14, 647751) Asked about his statement 1 that he had given Pandit Jawaharlal a power of attorney to act for him as leader of the Congress.
('62', 327, 6, 15, 647877) Party, Mr. Gandhi said that he had noted the Pandits reply and the implication that he was joking when he made the statement.
('62', 327, 6, 16, 648003) That is not wholly true.
('62', 327, 6, 17, 648028) There was and is a serious background to my statement.
('62', 327, 6, 18, 648083) Having abandoned politics for the present, and decided to devote myself to the elimination of untouchability from Hinduism I cannot govern the Congress Party.
('62', 327, 6, 19, 648242) When I am asked by individuals to give my views privately on some point at issue I may do so, but I am not in a position to define or discuss policies.
('62', 327, 6, 20, 648394) This is Pandit Jawaharlals work.
('62', 327, 6, 21, 648427) And I have no desire to interfere with his absolute discretion.
('62', 327, 6, 22, 648491) Hence my remark about power of attorney.
('62', 327, 7, 23, 648532) Will not the Pandits well known communist leaning mean that Congress policy will be given a communist bias under his guidance ?
('62', 327, 7, 24, 648660) I do not think so.
('62', 327, 7, 25, 648679) Jawaharlal is too honest a man for that.
('62', 327, 7, 26, 648720) I do not think he will depart from the fundamental Congress policy without giving ample notice to his colleagues.
('62', 327, 7, 27, 648834) I do not think that Jawaharlals own views are yet sufficiently crystallized to make any fundamental departure from Congress policy likely.
('62', 327, 7, 28, 648973) He is a firm believer in socialism, but his ideas on how best the socialist principle can be applied to Indian conditions are still in the melting pot.
('62', 327, 7, 29, 649125) His communist views need not, therefore, frighten anyone.
('62', 327, 8, 30, 649183) Reminded that the masses cannot be expected to make fine distinctions between ideological discussions and frank exhortations to pursue certain courses,
('62', 327, 9, 31, 649335) 1 According to a report in The Hindustan Times, 15 12 1933, concluding the discussion with workers in Delhi on December 14, Gandhiji had said that he had given general power of attorney to Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and asked those present to discuss everything concerning the Congress and other things with Pandit Jawaharlal.
('62', 328, 0, 1, 649659) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 329
('62', 328, 1, 2, 649706) Mr.Gandhi admitted that there was always a danger of the crowd misunderstanding a speakers purpose but declared that it was not Jawaharlals intention to inflame crowds.
('62', 328, 2, 3, 649875) Conversation then turned on communist opposition to large estates, which, apparently, Jawaharlal shares.
('62', 328, 2, 4, 649980) I do not think that the land should be parcelled out.
('62', 328, 2, 5, 650034) It would be a serious loss if the influence of the big hereditary landholder were wholly destroyed.
('62', 328, 2, 6, 650134) I do think, however, that the actual cultivator should have a title in the soil, and a larger share of its produce.
('62', 328, 2, 7, 650250) At present, in many places, he gets far too little.
('62', 328, 2, 8, 650302) He should get a fair share and not a bare maintenance.
('62', 328, 3, 9, 650357) Referring to agrarian movements in various parts of the country, Mr. Gandhi declared : Whatever the Government do, this tremendous awakening is not going to die out.
('62', 328, 3, 10, 650523) It has come to stay.
('62', 328, 3, 11, 650544) What has impressed me most is that it has been accompanied with so little violence, thus constituting an unconscious manifestation of the effectiveness of non violence.
('62', 328, 4, 12, 650713) Asked whether he had contemplated the danger of middlemen, in the shape of money lenders or marketing agents, etc., acquiring a foothold between the land owner and the cultivators as a result of recent land legislation, Mr. Gandhi replied : It would be a deplorable thing if the middlemen got hold of the land.
('62', 328, 4, 13, 651024) We must safeguard the interests of the actual cutlivator, by which I mean the man who himself tills the land.
('62', 328, 4, 14, 651134) He may employ many labourers to assist him, but so long as he works on the land himself he fulfils my definition of a cultivating occupant.
('62', 328, 4, 15, 651274) My work for the Harijans is purely religious.
('62', 328, 4, 16, 651320) It has no political motive behind it, and is essentially humanitarian.
('62', 328, 4, 17, 651391) It is in no sense of the term a political movement.
('62', 328, 5, 18, 651443) But you will not deny that the movement must have political consequences ?
('62', 328, 5, 19, 651518) That is true.
('62', 328, 5, 20, 651532) I do say that, though such political consequences will be by products of the movement, they do not constitute its purpose.
('62', 328, 5, 21, 651655) Any religious movement must have repercussions on other aspects of life, for religion in its broadest sense governs all depart ments of life.
('62', 328, 6, 22, 651797) Mr. Gandhi admitted that the movement was liable to exploitation for political purposes, and was aware of the assertions, voiced recently by Sir N. N. Sirkar, that its purpose was to consolidate Hinduism againt the other minorities, but he firmly and emphatically denied that he had any such object.
('62', 328, 6, 23, 652097) In fact he declared that he differed from the Hindu Mahasabha in this regard.
('62', 328, 6, 24, 652175) The Hindu Mahasabhas activities are essentially communal, and are designed to further Hindu interests as distinguished from other.
('62', 329, 0, 1, 652306) 330 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('62', 329, 1, 2, 652348) The Harijan movement has no communal bias.
('62', 329, 1, 3, 652391) It aims at the internal reform of Hinduism, at ridding it of artificial distinctions of high and low.
('62', 329, 1, 4, 652493) I am fighting for the same rights, without reservation, for the Harijans that caste Hindus have in matters religious, social and politi cal.
('62', 329, 1, 5, 652634) I am not aiming at increasing the numbers of Hindu voters as such.
('62', 329, 1, 6, 652701) So far as one single person can, I am trying to keep this move ment entirely free from politics.
('62', 329, 2, 7, 652798) When the scribe 1 referred to the view held by many members of the minority communities, Muslims, Christians, etc., that the political effect of the movement, and the political end sought by others, whatever Mr. Gandhis own purpose may be, is to secure the domination of a consolidated Hindu majority, overwhelming all minorities by its numbers, Mr. Gandhi repeated his resolve to keep the movement free from all taint of politics.
('62', 329, 2, 8, 653230) I want to absorb Christians, Muslims and others, as one indivisible nation, having common interest, then minorities will not feel themselves to be minorities.
('62', 329, 2, 9, 653389) If untouchability is abolished, the bar to closer intercourse between Hindus and the minorities will disappear, and with its disappearance will come a new unity of aim and interest, a new oneness.
('62', 329, 2, 10, 653586) This Harijan movement is in no sense exclusive.
('62', 329, 2, 11, 653634) It aims at removing untouchability in every shape and form.
('62', 329, 3, 12, 653694) Reminded that Dr. Moonje recently declared that Hinduism included all, Muslims, Christians, Parsis, and the rest, Mr. Gandhi replied : The object of Dr. Moonje differs greatly from mine.
('62', 329, 3, 13, 653881) They are haggling over seats in the Legislature.
('62', 329, 3, 14, 653930) That movement is solely political, mine is non political.
('62', 329, 4, 15, 653988) To question whether he approved of the bullying methods of some of his lieutenants in the matter of temple entry, Mr. Gandhi forcibly replied : If anybody in the Harijan movement tries to use force he is acting against my wishes.
('62', 329, 4, 16, 654218) I try to keep the movement from descen ding to low levels, but there are difficult elements in any move ment.
('62', 329, 4, 17, 654328) For myself, I refuse to open a temple unless satisfied that the wish that it should be opened to Harijans is general.
('62', 329, 4, 18, 654446) Recently I refused to open a temple because the trustees seemed to be sharply divided.
('62', 329, 4, 19, 654533) Only where temple entry is approved by an overwhelming majority of the actual worshippers and by the trustees of the temple, will I consent to open it.
('62', 329, 4, 20, 654685) Asked for his views on the Temple entry Bills now before the Legislative Assembly, Mr. Gandhi declared that the Bills were necessary to free the hands of
('62', 329, 5, 21, 654839) 1 The correspondent

('62', 330, 1, 2, 654906) trustees and worshippers who might be willing to open temples to Harijans but were prevented from doing so by judge made laws.
('62', 330, 1, 3, 655033) Unless we free Hinduism from these restraints it will become stagnant, and perish.
('62', 330, 1, 4, 655116) Unless we can root out untouchability from Hinduism it must perish, it will deserve to die, and I will not regret its passing away.
('62', 330, 1, 5, 655248) Un touchability must go.
('62', 330, 1, 6, 655273) What I say to Europeans is : Come down and work with us as free citizens, rather than as members of the ruling classes.
('62', 330, 2, 7, 655393) Mr. Gandhi said that he was amazed at the warmth of the welcome that Madras had given him, at the size of the crowd on the Triplicane Beach on Wednesday evening.
('62', 330, 2, 8, 655555) It took me 30 minutes to reach the platform, and 45 to return from it to my car again.
('62', 330, 2, 9, 655642) There were over one lakh of people, and it did good to see how Harijans and caste people mixed together in the crowd.
('62', 330, 2, 10, 655760) That would not have happened a few years ago.
('62', 330, 2, 11, 655806) Untou chability is going.

('62', 330, 5, 14, 655886) MADRAS, December 22, 1933 As usual I have experienced nothing but deep affection from the people wherever I have gone.
('62', 330, 5, 15, 656005) But I must confess that I was un prepared for the demonstration at the Beach and the demons trations that I witnessed during the visits to several labour areas.
('62', 330, 5, 16, 656166) The numbers that attended these demonstrations everywhere exceeded past records.
('62', 330, 5, 17, 656247) Whilst there is no doubt that personal affection and attachment had to do a great deal with them, I am convinced that the vast mass of humanity that seemed to cling to me fully understood and appreciated what I stood for and what I had come for.
('62', 330, 5, 18, 656493) If their religious sense had revolted against the drive against untouchability, the exhibition of their affection, even if I could not have lost it altogether, would have been tempered with moderation and restraint, if not reasonable cool ness.
('62', 330, 5, 19, 656738) I am used to reading the mass mind by taking at a sweep the ex pression in their eyes and their general demeanour.
('62', 330, 5, 20, 656853) I could find no

('62', 331, 0, 1, 656997) 332 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('62', 331, 1, 2, 657039) trace of disapproval of what I have been doing in connection with untouchability.
('62', 331, 1, 3, 657121) The manner in which they came forward with their contributions when I asked for them was also significant and went to strengthen the impressions I have given.
('62', 331, 1, 4, 657280) I am, therefore, filled with hope for the future.
('62', 331, 1, 5, 657330) I feel that even in the South untouchability is shaken to its very roots.
('62', 331, 1, 6, 657404) I would like to say to my sanatanist friends that I have no desire whatsoever to wound their susceptibilities.
('62', 331, 1, 7, 657515) I want to find points of agreement; and I know there are many.
('62', 331, 1, 8, 657578) The points of disagreement are few.
('62', 331, 1, 9, 657614) If my approach to them cannot bring about immediate agreement, I know that time will, if I have patience which I feel I have.
('62', 331, 1, 10, 657740) I would like to add one word as to the behaviour of the Police.
('62', 331, 1, 11, 657804) Today was really a trying time for them, as I had to pass through the business parts of George Town; and it gives me pleasure to be able to say that their behaviour was friendly and helpful.
('62', 331, 1, 12, 657995) They became as it were one of the people and handled them in a gentle manner.
('62', 331, 1, 13, 658073) I am grateful to them for this exhibition of friendliness.

('62', 332, 1, 2, 658922) a sum of Rs. 145. I myself was a lawyer once.
('62', 332, 1, 3, 658968) I say I cannot accept such a small sum from the lawyers.
('62', 332, 1, 4, 659025) They are not so poor.
('62', 332, 1, 5, 659047) I under stand from this that the Guntur lawyers have not interested themselves in the Harijan cause.
('62', 332, 1, 6, 659148) This sum of Rs. 145 can be given by a single vakil.
('62', 332, 1, 7, 659200) I ask them, What are you going to do ? I know the lawyers of Guntur.
('62', 332, 1, 8, 659269) That is why I am telling them so.
('62', 332, 1, 9, 659303) Last time when I was here, they gave me a bag of money.
('62', 332, 1, 10, 659359) All days are not alike.
('62', 332, 1, 11, 659383) Then money was plentiful, now a little scarce.
('62', 332, 1, 12, 659430) I have just visited Mr. Punna Raos Gurunatheswara temple at Tilakpet.
('62', 332, 1, 13, 659500) Because of the name given to the deity, the temple has become unpopular as the deity was named after the paternal uncle of Mr. Punna Rao.
('62', 332, 1, 14, 659638) In truth, there is nothing wrong in the name Guru natheswara, though the name Gurunath may be wrong.
('62', 332, 1, 15, 659739) In my opinion God should not be named so as to perpetuate the memory of a human being.
('62', 332, 1, 16, 659826) It is not proper that the name of the donor should go with the charity.
('62', 332, 1, 17, 659898) This is my personal opinion.
('62', 332, 1, 18, 659927) The name of the God should not really matter.
('62', 332, 1, 19, 659973) Mr. Punna Rao, the late Gurnadhams brothers son, has told me that he has no objection to change the name of the deity.
('62', 332, 1, 20, 660092) The deity will hereafter be called Gouri Vish weshwara.
('62', 332, 1, 21, 660148) I have signed the paper containing the new name.
('62', 332, 1, 22, 660197) Mr. Punna Rao wants to throw open the temple to the Harijans.
('62', 332, 1, 23, 660259) But I have asked him not to do it now and for this reason.
('62', 332, 1, 24, 660318) Temple entry and change of name at one and the same time is not desirable under the peculiar circumstances of the case.
('62', 332, 1, 25, 660438) I am not against any temple being thrown open to the Harijans.
('62', 332, 1, 26, 660501) But I am not for compulsion.
('62', 332, 1, 27, 660530) When the bhaktas and the trustees are willing, the temple should be thrown open to the Harijans.
('62', 332, 1, 28, 660627) Now that the deitys name has been changed, the trustees and myself are anxious to see how many of you will visit the temple.
('62', 332, 1, 29, 660752) Three months hence from today, i.e., on the 23rd of March next, this temple will be thrown open to Harijans.
('62', 332, 1, 30, 660861) It cannot be done unless public opinion favours it.
('62', 332, 1, 31, 660913) If public opinion favours it, the temple will be thrown open on the 23rd of March next, by which time I hope the issue will be settled.
('62', 332, 1, 32, 661049) I hope you will attend this temple from now on and witness the entry into it by the Harijans on the 23rd of March next.
('62', 332, 1, 33, 661169) If the savarnas do not do justice to the Harijans the Hindu religion will perish.
('62', 332, 1, 34, 661251) No religion perishes owing to extraneous causes.
('62', 332, 1, 35, 661300) It lies in nobodys power to do it.
('62', 332, 1, 36, 661335) But a religion will perish if those who follow it tread the path of adharma.

('62', 333, 1, 2, 661476) 357. SPEECH AT HARIJANS MEETING, THALLAPALEM December 23, 1933 It gives me much pleasure to be able to come here.
('62', 333, 1, 3, 661590) But I must also tell you that it gives me much trouble.
('62', 333, 1, 4, 661646) The car could not negotiate its road to my satisfaction.
('62', 333, 1, 5, 661703) Therefore, most of the way I had to walk.
('62', 333, 1, 6, 661745) Walking itself is no trouble.
('62', 333, 1, 7, 661775) But the fact is I had no time and yet I have to come here.
('62', 333, 1, 8, 661834) The promise having been made, I have to fulfil that promise.
('62', 333, 1, 9, 661895) By cutting the knot, I have performed the opening ceremony of the Harijan Ayurvedic Kuteeram.
('62', 333, 1, 10, 661989) I hope it will be a proper institution for healing the ills of those surrounding this place.
('62', 333, 1, 11, 662082) Though, through the kindness of the organizers of this function, the address has not been read to you, I have read it.
('62', 333, 1, 12, 662201) The address is a report of your present activities and somewhat your hopes for the future.
('62', 333, 1, 13, 662292) I do wish that your hopes for the future may be fulfilled, but as a worker of 50 years standing I want to utter a word of caution.
('62', 333, 1, 14, 662423) You have a very ambitious programme and if the managers or trustees of your programme are vigilant, painstaking, honest and men of unimpeachable character, it is just possible that you can work up the programme.
('62', 333, 1, 15, 662635) But if there is want of vigilance, want of care, want of honesty, want of ability, I promise that not even one item of your programme will be fulfilled.
('62', 333, 1, 16, 662788) For my part, I will appeal to the Harijan Sevak Sangh to give you an equal contribution for the work you might do.
('62', 333, 1, 17, 662903) Well, I can make this promise on behalf of the Harijan Sevak Sangh, viz., that if you will produce a workable scheme and men of character that will satisfy the Harijaan Sevak Sangh, and if you produce proper accounts which can be inspected from time to time by the Harijan Sevak Sangh, certainly the Harijan Sevak Sangh will be able to render you help, financially.
('62', 333, 1, 18, 663269) Therefore, if you do not receive help from the Harijan Sevak Sangh you will have to blame yourself and not the Harijan Sevak Sangh.
('62', 333, 1, 19, 663401) But you will be able to get help from the Harijan Sevak Sangh if you satisfy the conditions I have suggested.
('62', 333, 1, 20, 663511) As far as I know from the previous history of the Harijan Sevak Sangh it never went back from the promises it made.
('62', 333, 1, 21, 663627) The Harijan Sevak Sangh has enough of money to satisfy your wants.
('62', 333, 1, 22, 663694) To those who have assembled here I appeal to make use of all the institutions that may rise in your midst in every legitimate way possible.
('62', 333, 1, 23, 663834) I want to hear of Harijan institutions coming into being here
('62', 334, 0, 1, 663896) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 335
('62', 334, 1, 2, 663943) and everywhere.
('62', 334, 1, 3, 663959) The object of the Harijan Sevak Sangh is not to displace your labours but to supplement them.
('62', 334, 1, 4, 664053) The Harijan Sevak Sangh will have more than justified its existence if it will be able to serve Harijans properly.
('62', 334, 1, 5, 664168) Therefore, you can easily under stand that the reputation of the Harijan Sevak Sangh depends entirely upon your hands and your own approval.
('62', 334, 1, 6, 664309) One thing more I would like to say and that is the same I have been repeating everywhere.
('62', 334, 1, 7, 664399) That is this.
('62', 334, 1, 8, 664413) In this movement of purification Harijans will have to play an honourable and valuable part.
('62', 334, 1, 9, 664506) I repeat that you should all observe, if you have not already been observing, the laws of hygiene and sanitation.
('62', 334, 1, 10, 664620) It does not mean that all savarna Hindus are living in sanitary conditions.
('62', 334, 1, 11, 664696) As a Harijan by choice, I ask you to rise above these things and purify yourselves, unmindful of what savarna Hindus do or what they are.
('62', 334, 1, 12, 664834) Similarly if there are any Harijans, who are eating carrion and beef, I invite them to give up these habits and, if they have never touched these things, I want them to become missionaries and do propaganda work against such habits.
('62', 334, 1, 13, 665067) And then comes the drink curse.
('62', 334, 1, 14, 665099) If you are, or any one of you, addicted to drink, give it up, for drink is a poison.
('62', 334, 1, 15, 665184) You should not take that poison because many savarna Hindus also take poison.
('62', 334, 1, 16, 665262) You do not want to sink with savarna Hindu but you want to swim with them, and if you have developed vigorous arms and can swim well, savarna Hindus will also rise; I know for certain that the time is coming in the near future when the Harijans will be able to help savarna Hindus out of the mire in which they are falling.
('62', 334, 1, 17, 665586) Therefore I want every Harijan to work in robust faith.
('62', 334, 1, 18, 665642) To savarna Hindus I want to say one word.
('62', 334, 1, 19, 665684) If you do not forget all distinctions of high and low, rid yourselves and your hearts of untouchability altogether, you and I and the Hindu race will perish.
('62', 334, 1, 20, 665842) I want you to believe this although thousands of persons may say anything to the contrary.
('62', 334, 1, 21, 665933) What I say is out of rich experience.

('62', 335, 2, 3, 666379) December 24, 1933
('62', 335, 3, 4, 666397) FRIENDS, Let me tender you my congratulations on the most admirable arrangements made in order to secure a straight passage for me to the meeting place.
('62', 335, 3, 5, 666550) You can well imagine that I have very limited energy to work my way through pressing crowds.
('62', 335, 3, 6, 666643) It was therefore most re freshing for me to find here that I had not to push my way through crowds.
('62', 335, 3, 7, 666743) I thank you for the several addresses and the purse just presented to me and I thank you also for the restraint with which you have refrained from desiring to read those addresses.
('62', 335, 3, 8, 666924) You know the purpose of this tour.
('62', 335, 3, 9, 666959) I want you to join me in driving out the curse of untouchability.
('62', 335, 3, 10, 667025) I want you to join with me in whole heartedly believing that untouchability as we practise it can have no religious sanction.
('62', 335, 3, 11, 667151) The very thought that any single human being can be born untouchable is most debasing.
('62', 335, 3, 12, 667238) We are too near our own times to notice how Hinduism is disintegrating under the load of this heavy curse and I must repeat here what I have said from a thousand platforms that if untouchability is not removed, Hinduism dies.
('62', 335, 3, 13, 667464) It therefore gladdens my heart when I see such a large number of people gathering at this meeting and giving their coppers.
('62', 335, 3, 14, 667588) But I must not detain you and detain myself discoursing on this problem of untouchability.
('62', 335, 3, 15, 667679) I have a heavy programme in front of me for the day.
('62', 335, 3, 16, 667732) I will therefore close by repeating my thanks to you for the admirable arrangements, the address and the purse, and by the prayer that God may give us sufficient strength to go through this process of purification.
('62', 335, 3, 17, 667947) I would like to give a few brief minutes to the sale of these frames containing the address and to the sisters here to discard their precious ornaments.
('62', 335, 3, 18, 668100) If any of you have not contributed to the purse and desire to pay your share to this purse, you will kindly do so.
('62', 335, 3, 19, 668215) But now these two frames have suffered a reverse.
('62', 335, 3, 20, 668265) The glass is broken.
('62', 335, 3, 21, 668286) Let this be a lesson for the future that no frames are presented to me.
('62', 335, 3, 22, 668358) I know that Andhra is an artistic province of India.
('62', 335, 3, 23, 668411) You must therefore discover the artistic and simple method of framing the addresses you present.

('62', 336, 2, 3, 668603) December 24, 1933 I first learnt to beg pennies from indentured labourers in South Africa.
('62', 336, 2, 4, 668694) Such collections have always been charged with refreshing blessings.
('62', 336, 2, 5, 668763) I cannot recall a single instance of a man or a woman who repented for having given to me.
('62', 336, 2, 6, 668854) Causes for which I have begged were good.
('62', 336, 2, 7, 668896) The Harijan cause for which I beg now is undoubtedly the best for which I have begged.
('62', 336, 2, 8, 668983) I am now inviting savarna Hindus to a purificatory rite and to repentance.
('62', 336, 2, 9, 669058) Whatever little a savarna Hindu does for Harijans, he does to uplift himself or herself and Hinduism.

('62', 336, 4, 12, 669225) December 24, 1933 I am grateful to you for your addresses of welcome 1 and the money you have given me.
('62', 336, 4, 13, 669329) But what you paid does not satisfy me.
('62', 336, 4, 14, 669368) I expect more.
('62', 336, 4, 15, 669383) I am now disposing of the two addresses presented to me in auction.
('62', 336, 5, 16, 669451) I congratulate you on the excellent arrangements you have made for holding this meeting.
('62', 336, 5, 17, 669540) This place is richly endowed by nature; and beautifying things is a special characteristic of nature.
('62', 336, 5, 18, 669642) By Gods grace, you have not spoiled the beauty of nature but maintained it intact.
('62', 336, 5, 19, 669725) All of you know that you have in your midst an ashram known as the Valmiki Ashram.
('62', 336, 5, 20, 669808) I have just visited that Ashram, which gives shelter to Harijan boys, and I had the pleasure of hearing the bhajans and keertans sung by those boys.
('62', 336, 5, 21, 669957) I was very much impressed by them.
('62', 336, 5, 22, 669992) They have presented me with a beautiful address in which they ask for your support.
('62', 336, 5, 23, 670076) The Ashram stands in need of your supportfrom all of you; it deserves all the support that the people of the taluk give it.
('62', 336, 5, 24, 670200) Nature intended all human beings to be equals; but man in his arrogance has created invidious distinctions by classing some as high and some as low.
('62', 336, 5, 25, 670349) God does not recognize these inequalities.

('62', 337, 1, 4, 670819) I ask you all to join me in my prayer to Almighty to give you strength and courage to eradicate the curse of untouchability entirely.
('62', 337, 1, 5, 670953) I do not want to detain you longer.

('62', 337, 3, 10, 671210) I thank you for all these addresses and several purses.
('62', 337, 3, 11, 671266) It gave me very great pleasure to be able to renew my acquaintance with Rajahmundry and its citizens.
('62', 337, 3, 12, 671368) You have taught me to expect great things from you and I hope that you will in this Harijan cause, live up to the expectations that you have raised.
('62', 337, 3, 13, 671517) I see here the address pesented by the Hindu Samaj.
('62', 337, 3, 14, 671569) I have gone through its programme that was sent to me.
('62', 337, 3, 15, 671624) It is an ambitious pro gramme; but no programme whether ambitious or unambitious can possibly be fulfilled without the necessary change of heart amongst the millions of savarna Hindus.
('62', 337, 3, 16, 671809) Untouchability is like a slow poison killing the Hindu body, and even as you cannot sustain a body that is slowly perishing, you will not be able to sustain this perishing Hinduism unless you remove the curse of untouchability.
('62', 337, 4, 17, 672037) I am too sorry to have to inform you that it will be impossible for me to go on with my speech unless I secure complete silence on your part.
('62', 337, 4, 18, 672179) Now by the time you sit down, I propose to do a little bit of work and therefore I propose to put up this address by the Municipality for auction.

('62', 338, 1, 2, 672528) 363. REPLY TO HARIJAN DE`PUTATION 1
('62', 338, 2, 3, 672564) RAJAHMUNDRY, December 24, 1933 One important question that you have raised is that the Harijan Sevak Sangh should be principally manned and managed by you.
('62', 338, 2, 4, 672720) That shows that you have not followed the pages of the Harijan.
('62', 338, 2, 5, 672784) That shows also that you have not understood the origin of the Board.
('62', 338, 2, 6, 672854) The Board has been formed to enable savarna Hindus to do repentance and reparation to you.
('62', 338, 2, 7, 672945) It is thus a Board of debtors and you are the creditors.
('62', 338, 2, 8, 673002) You owe nothing to the debtors, and therefore, so far as this Board is concerned, the initiative has to come from the debtors.
('62', 338, 2, 9, 673129) You have to certify whether the debtors discharge their obligation or not.
('62', 338, 2, 10, 673204) What you have to do is to enable and help them to discharge their obligations; that is to say, you can tell them how they can discharge their obligation, you can tell them what in your opinion will satisfy the great body of Harijans.
('62', 338, 2, 11, 673438) They may or may not accept your advice.
('62', 338, 2, 12, 673478) If they do not, naturally they run the risk of incurring your displeasure.
('62', 338, 2, 13, 673553) A debtor may go to a creditor and say to him, I have brought so much money, will you take it ? The creditor may say, Off you go; I want full payment or none. Or the creditor may say, What you have brought is not part payment, but worse. All these things you, creditors, can do.
('62', 338, 2, 14, 673831) And so, when this Board was established and some Harijan friends wrote to me, I told them that Harijans should form themselves into advisory boards or boards of inspection.
('62', 338, 2, 15, 674004) I want you to understand this distinction thoroughly.
('62', 338, 2, 16, 674058) You will please see that there is no desire not to accept your advice or co operation or help.
('62', 338, 2, 17, 674153) I am only putting before you the true and logical position.
('62', 338, 2, 18, 674213) This is a period of grace that God has given to caste Hindus, and it is during this period of grace that they have to prove their sincerity.
('62', 338, 2, 19, 674354) And I am moving heaven and earth and am going about from place to place, simply in order that this obligation on the part of savarna Hindus may be fully discharged.
('62', 338, 2, 20, 674519) A member of the deputation then suggested that the Board should appoint advisory committees of Harijans of its own selection.
('62', 338, 2, 21, 674645) Do not ask the Board to select a committee of Harijans, but select your own committee and say to the Board you have elected
('62', 338, 3, 22, 674769) 1 A deputation of Harijans from East Godavari District met Gandhiji at Raja hmundry.

('62', 339, 1, 2, 674896) these members and it should carry on correspondence with them.
('62', 339, 1, 3, 674959) There is another danger in the suggestion.
('62', 339, 1, 4, 675002) There may be factions and divisions among you.
('62', 339, 1, 5, 675049) Different committees may be appointed by different factions.
('62', 339, 1, 6, 675110) The Board may recognize all of them.
('62', 339, 1, 7, 675147) But that will be unfortunate.
('62', 339, 1, 8, 675177) Let there be no quarrels among you.
('62', 339, 1, 9, 675213) Present a united front to the debtors.
('62', 339, 1, 10, 675252) The debtors may put you against one another, though the Board, if it is worth its name, will not do that.
('62', 339, 1, 11, 675358) The Congress has been able to present a united front.
('62', 339, 1, 12, 675412) Today, the Congress is full of simple men like you and me.
('62', 339, 1, 13, 675471) You should have a body of business like men who will put down with a strong hand all quarrels among you.
('62', 339, 1, 14, 675576) Then you will dominate the Board without being on it.
('62', 339, 1, 15, 675630) Do not be easily satisfied.
('62', 339, 1, 16, 675658) Tell the debtors you are not going to be satisfied with 5 shillings in the pound but that you must have 20 shillings in the pound.
('62', 339, 1, 17, 675789) This is not a matter for bargaining.

('62', 339, 4, 21, 675895) AMALA, I have your letters.
('62', 339, 4, 22, 675923) Whatever I did was done out of pure love.
('62', 339, 4, 23, 675965) That you did not feel the love is my misfortune.

('62', 339, 4, 26, 676107) You know what is wanted.
('62', 339, 4, 27, 676132) You will do it after your style not mine.
('62', 339, 4, 28, 676174) Only keep your mind and body fit.
('62', 339, 4, 29, 676208) Do your Hindi in your own fashion.
('62', 339, 4, 30, 676243) Take care of yourself and your things.
('62', 339, 4, 31, 676282) Keep your room and yourself tidy.
('62', 339, 4, 32, 676316) You should select good and easy Hindi books.

('62', 340, 3, 4, 676609) TARA, It was good news that the trouble about your teeth is over.
('62', 340, 3, 5, 676675) Your decision to go to Ahmedabad only after seeing Ramniklal is correct.
('62', 340, 3, 6, 676748) Now that the complaint about your teeth has disappeared, your health should improve still further.
('62', 340, 3, 7, 676847) Keep Ramniklal informed.
('62', 340, 3, 8, 676872) I deliberately dont write to him.
('62', 340, 3, 9, 676906) From the religious point of view, [my tour] is progressing very well.
('62', 340, 3, 10, 676976) The body also gives excellent work.
('62', 340, 3, 11, 677012) You must write to me twice or thrice a week.

('62', 340, 8, 18, 677315) KUSUM, I have replied to your letter by wire.
('62', 340, 8, 19, 677361) You have woken up too late.
('62', 340, 8, 20, 677389) You stopped writing to me.
('62', 340, 8, 21, 677416) Every day I hoped I would get a letter from you, but it seems you have resolved not to write.
('62', 340, 8, 22, 677510) When I got your letter, I already had a long list of recruits.
('62', 340, 8, 23, 677573) Among them there are three women; Mira, Kisan and Om.
('62', 340, 8, 24, 677627) In all we are nine.
('62', 340, 8, 25, 677647) What work do you do at present ?
('62', 340, 8, 26, 677680) How do you spend your time ?
('62', 340, 8, 27, 677709) Does Pyarelal write to you ?
('62', 340, 8, 28, 677738) How is he ?
('62', 340, 8, 29, 677750) Do you read Harijanbandhu ?
('62', 340, 8, 30, 677778) My health is fairly good.
('62', 340, 8, 31, 677804) It can stand travelling all right.

('62', 341, 3, 4, 678123) RAMA, I got your letter.
('62', 341, 3, 5, 678148) It is certainly good that you try to work with the arm only little by little.
('62', 341, 3, 6, 678226) There is plenty of other kind of work for you to do.
('62', 341, 3, 7, 678279) You should not mind if Dhiru feels unhappy at being separated from you.
('62', 341, 3, 8, 678351) If his health remains good, he will in time become self reliant in Bhavnagar.
('62', 341, 3, 9, 678429) Dudhibehns company is bound to benefit him.
('62', 341, 3, 10, 678473) Moreover, Kusum also is there.
('62', 341, 3, 11, 678504) Let him, therefore, stay on there permanently.
('62', 341, 3, 12, 678551) It will be enough if you continue to write to him regularly.

('62', 341, 7, 16, 678709) December 25, 1933
('62', 341, 8, 17, 678727) BA, You must have got the long letter which I wrote to you last Monday.
('62', 341, 8, 18, 678799) This Monday we are in Sitanagaram.
('62', 341, 8, 19, 678834) It is situated on the banks of the Godavari.
('62', 341, 8, 20, 678879) It is a small village, in Andhradesha, and has an ashram in it.
('62', 341, 8, 21, 678943) Being a village, it is completely peaceful.
('62', 341, 8, 22, 678987) We came here in a boat.
('62', 341, 8, 23, 679011) The river is quite big and, therefore, small steamers can sail on it.
('62', 341, 8, 24, 679081) We visited Madras and spent three days there.
('62', 341, 8, 25, 679127) Sastri was of course there.
('62', 341, 8, 26, 679155) I met Jethalal.
('62', 341, 8, 27, 679171) Gangabhabhi lives in the city itself.
('62', 341, 8, 28, 679209) I met Jethalals wife, too.
('62', 341, 8, 29, 679236) Both are in good health.
('62', 341, 8, 30, 679261) Jethalal gets a pay of Rs. 150 and is, therefore, quite happy.
('62', 341, 8, 31, 679324) I met Urmiladevis son also.
('62', 341, 8, 32, 679352) There was a large number of visitors.
('62', 341, 8, 33, 679390) Lakshmi is quite well.
('62', 341, 8, 34, 679413) Papa also is in Madras.
('62', 341, 8, 35, 679437) Lakshmi stayed with me all the three days.
('62', 341, 8, 36, 679480) She was happy in the company of Mirabehn, Kisan and Om.
('62', 341, 8, 37, 679536) We shall be meeting once again, for my tour of that part is incomplete.
('62', 341, 8, 38, 679608) My health is all right.
('62', 341, 8, 39, 679632) I was again examined by two doctors.
('62', 341, 8, 40, 679669) There is, therefore, no reason at all for you to worry about me.
('62', 341, 8, 41, 679734) Have Dahibhens teeth improved?
('62', 341, 8, 42, 679765) Do you get the Jam e Jamshed ?
('62', 341, 8, 43, 679796) You asked for something like a
('62', 342, 0, 1, 679827) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 343
('62', 342, 1, 2, 679874) discourse.
('62', 342, 1, 3, 679885) I think I must give you one today.
('62', 342, 2, 4, 679920) The chapters of the Gita recited today were IX, X, XI and XII.
('62', 342, 2, 5, 679983) In Chapter IX, the Lord says that those who worship Him attain to Him.
('62', 342, 2, 6, 680054) 1 In Chapter XII, He explains who should be called a bhakta.
('62', 342, 3, 7, 680115) The beauty of the description is that it does not contain any quality which even the most ignorant person cannot cultivate.
('62', 342, 3, 8, 680239) Any man or woman who strives unaided by another can become a bhakta and be one with the Lord.
('62', 342, 3, 9, 680333) The qualities mentioned are these.
('62', 342, 3, 10, 680368) The bhakta has ill will for nobody but is a friend of all and has compassion for all; he has no feeling of personal attachment towards anything or anybody, is devoid of ego, is equal minded to happiness and unhappiness and is of a forgiving nature.
('62', 342, 3, 11, 680617) He is ever contented, is self controlled and keeps his vows; he has dedicated his mind and reason to God.
('62', 342, 3, 12, 680723) He causes pain to none and has no fears and worries, desires nothing, is pure in mind and heart and skilful in work, has renounced everything and treats friend and enemy with equal regard, is indifferent to respect and disrespect, bears heat and cold, is unmoved by praise or censure, looks upon wherever he happens to be as his home, that is, has no home of his own, doesnt speak unnecessarily and has a steady mind.
('62', 342, 3, 13, 681141) Such a person [says the Lord] may be described as my bhakta.
('62', 342, 3, 14, 681202) If all of you reflect over this deeply, you will realize that anybody who wants can become a bhakta without help from any other person.
('62', 342, 4, 15, 681338) Blesssings to all from

('62', 343, 2, 3, 681499) SITANAGARAM, December 25, 1933
('62', 343, 3, 4, 681530) BHAI VALLABHBHAI, You waited for a letter from me and I waited for one from you.
('62', 343, 3, 5, 681611) I was under the impression that I had not received a reply to my letter.
('62', 343, 3, 6, 681684) We are touring with such speed that I cant remember dates or days.
('62', 343, 3, 7, 681751) I dont remember, even, to whom I have to write and what.
('62', 343, 3, 8, 681808) That I am past sixty may also be one reason for this.
('62', 343, 4, 9, 681862) Chandrashankar has unnecessarily alarmed you about [my rising] at three.
('62', 343, 4, 10, 681935) If I did not get up at that hour, I would feel very uneasy.
('62', 343, 4, 11, 681995) You should insist, rather, on my going to bed early.
('62', 343, 4, 12, 682048) That rule is certainly not being observed just now.
('62', 343, 4, 13, 682100) Still, all the doctors tell me that my health has remained very good so far.
('62', 343, 4, 14, 682177) Nor do I write as many letters as you think I do.
('62', 343, 4, 15, 682227) I write only such letters as I must.
('62', 343, 4, 16, 682264) If you were with me, you also would press me to write some of them.
('62', 343, 4, 17, 682332) I must admit that your complaint that I left you alone [in jail] is just.
('62', 343, 4, 18, 682406) But the problem will be solved by and by, I am sure.
('62', 343, 4, 19, 682459) Stop worrying about me completely.
('62', 343, 4, 20, 682494) I dont overstep the limits of my health.
('62', 343, 4, 21, 682535) If you saw how I work, you would admit that I was taking very good care of it.
('62', 343, 4, 22, 682614) Or truly speaking I should say that God has been preserving it.
('62', 343, 4, 23, 682678) What would He do, however, if I opposed Him ?
('62', 343, 4, 24, 682724) That He has been saving me from serious dangers is a sign that I have lost myself in Him.
('62', 343, 4, 25, 682814) In Madras I was in danger every day of getting crushed, but I was saved.
('62', 343, 4, 26, 682887) That was not mans doing.
('62', 343, 4, 27, 682912) It was Gods will.
('62', 343, 4, 28, 682930) The rule about five hours has been observed mostly on paper only.
('62', 343, 5, 29, 682996) I will certainly write to Ba every week.
('62', 343, 5, 30, 683037) So far I have not let a single week pass.
('62', 343, 5, 31, 683079) God will keep her firm.
('62', 343, 5, 32, 683103) Who else can do that?
('62', 343, 5, 33, 683125) There is no cause at all for worrying about Mani.
('62', 343, 6, 34, 683175) I had sent a wire immediately to Kanjibhai 1 , and I had received a reply both by wire and letter.
('62', 343, 6, 35, 683274) I have again replied by letter and said that he should not come thus far for my sake.
('62', 343, 6, 36, 683360) If, however, he himself

('62', 344, 1, 2, 683460) thought it necessary to come, he might certainly do so.
('62', 344, 1, 3, 683516) I have even given him [convenient] dates.
('62', 344, 1, 4, 683558) I forgot to mention all this in my letter to you.
('62', 344, 1, 5, 683608) His letter was a fine one.
('62', 344, 2, 6, 683635) I think it will be difficult to meet Raja, though Lakshmi saw me in Madras.
('62', 344, 2, 7, 683711) She is running the sixth month and cannot, therefore, move about freely.
('62', 344, 2, 8, 683784) She keeps good health.
('62', 344, 2, 9, 683807) Raja wants the delivery to take place under his care.
('62', 344, 2, 10, 683861) Devdas also will go to Madras.
('62', 344, 2, 11, 683892) Lakshmi was in good spirits.
('62', 344, 2, 12, 683921) Raja will be released on 6th February.
('62', 344, 3, 13, 683960) s 1 condition is the same that it has been.
('62', 344, 3, 14, 684004) He is discontented with himself.
('62', 344, 3, 15, 684037) He is miserable because.
('62', 344, 3, 16, 684062) is again pregant.
('62', 344, 3, 17, 684080) He cannot exercise self control and afterwards he feels unhappy.
('62', 344, 3, 18, 684145) I have tried my best to comfort him.
('62', 344, 3, 19, 684182) But on the whole he is better where he is.
('62', 344, 4, 20, 684225) Princess Aristarchi writes to me every week without fail.
('62', 344, 4, 21, 684283) She sends money too.
('62', 344, 4, 22, 684304) There is no limit to her kindness.
('62', 344, 4, 23, 684339) She is now helping Trivedis Manu .
('62', 344, 4, 24, 684374) 2 I have written to the Princess and requested her to explain to him his duty.
('62', 344, 4, 25, 684453) It is true that Manilal and Sorabji 3 are quarrelling with each other.
('62', 344, 4, 26, 684524) Their quarrel is about the policy to be followed there.
('62', 344, 4, 27, 684580) I couldnt advise either of them in this quarrel.
('62', 344, 4, 28, 684629) But I have written to Manilal and told him that he should follow what seems right to him, without departing from civility.
('62', 344, 4, 29, 684752) I have advised him not to make the quarrel a personal affair.
('62', 344, 4, 30, 684814) I believe their differences will be resolved.
('62', 344, 5, 31, 684860) Gordhanbhai continues to write about Vithalbhais donation.
('62', 344, 5, 32, 684919) I have not read all that he has written.
('62', 344, 5, 33, 684960) I will take a suitable opportunity to reply to him and then keep quiet.
('62', 344, 5, 34, 685032) I had a very sweet letter from Subhas.
('62', 344, 5, 35, 685071) I did send it to the Press.
('62', 344, 5, 36, 685099) I am sure it must have been printed.
('62', 344, 6, 37, 685136) The tour is going on very well.
('62', 344, 6, 38, 685168) There is no heart burning anywhere.
('62', 344, 6, 39, 685204) So far I have not met people in the South bent on creating trouble.
('62', 344, 6, 40, 685272) About the future, God alone knows.
('62', 344, 6, 41, 685307) The crowds are as large as ever.
('62', 344, 6, 42, 685340) We are in Sitanagaram today.
('62', 344, 6, 43, 685369) There is perfect peace here.
('62', 344, 6, 44, 685398) This is a small village.
('62', 344, 6, 45, 685423) Today is my silence day.
('62', 344, 6, 46, 685448) Tomorrow also I shall be here.
('62', 344, 6, 47, 685479) If I had not got these two days at one place, it would have

('62', 345, 2, 6, 685842) Munshi seemed to be in good health.
('62', 345, 2, 7, 685878) There was a wire from Bhula bhai.

('62', 345, 3, 9, 685945) Kaka and Surendra Mashruwala are in Gujarat.

('62', 346, 3, 6, 686587) Then I could not proceed further with that letter.
('62', 346, 3, 7, 686638) And now I am writing this one.
('62', 346, 3, 8, 686669) It is the night of silence day, in Sitanagaram.
('62', 346, 3, 9, 686717) The silence is not yet over.
('62', 346, 3, 10, 686746) I will break it at 9.30 p.m.
('62', 346, 3, 11, 686775) It is 8.30 p.m.
('62', 346, 3, 12, 686791) It is not incorrect to say that I can write only on Mondays and Tuesdays.
('62', 346, 3, 13, 686865) I always get up at three in the morning and write what I can between then and prayer time.
('62', 346, 3, 14, 686956) I may, of course, be interrupted even during that period.
('62', 346, 3, 15, 687014) When I am in a train, sometimes, I cannot even get up at three.
('62', 346, 3, 16, 687078) I am having a wonderful experience during this tour.
('62', 346, 3, 17, 687131) The crowds are larger than they used to be in the past.
('62', 346, 3, 18, 687187) But these numbers may easily deceive us, for we have to reach crores of people.
('62', 346, 3, 19, 687267) Nor is it that all the people who come immediately change their way of living.
('62', 346, 3, 20, 687346) The only consolation is the thought that this propaganda does not seem to displease all these hundreds of thousands.
('62', 346, 3, 21, 687463) We can therefore hope that sooner or later the practice of untouchability will disappear completely.
('62', 346, 3, 22, 687564) You should make your study of the Gita thorough in every respect.
('62', 346, 3, 23, 687630) You should master both the grammatical construction and the literal meaning of the verses.
('62', 346, 3, 24, 687721) I am sure you can recite the verses with correct pronunciation of the words.
('62', 346, 3, 25, 687798) Again, the other reading may be limited in extent but it should be deep.
('62', 346, 3, 26, 687871) A person who digests one book knows more than another who reads a thousand without digesting any of them.
('62', 346, 3, 27, 687977) Do you have a spinning wheel with you ?
('62', 346, 3, 28, 688017) Wardha seems to have agreed with Vimu and Rama in every way.
('62', 346, 3, 29, 688078) Ramas hand may become completely all right.
('62', 346, 3, 30, 688122) Dhiru seems to be happy in Bhavnagar, but we cannot still feel that the problem about him is solved.
('62', 346, 3, 31, 688223) He is still weak, but his health is much better than it used to be.
('62', 346, 3, 32, 688291) Dudhibehn does of course look after him carefully.
('62', 346, 3, 33, 688342) Kusum also is there.
('62', 346, 3, 34, 688363) Nanabhai, too, takes care of him.
('62', 346, 3, 35, 688397) Balabhadra is very happy there.
('62', 346, 3, 36, 688429) Appa Patwardhan has come here to see me.
('62', 346, 3, 37, 688470) He will leave now.
('62', 346, 3, 38, 688489) Kisan has joined me from Wardha.
('62', 346, 3, 39, 688522) She is a friend of Prema and is a very good young woman.
('62', 346, 3, 40, 688579) She has, however, become a little weak physically.
('62', 346, 3, 41, 688630) Chandrashankar is carrying the burden of two journals quite well.
('62', 346, 3, 42, 688696) This time Thakkar Bapas place is taken by Malkani.
('62', 346, 3, 43, 688747) The work
('62', 347, 0, 1, 688756) 348 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('62', 347, 1, 2, 688798) is going on well.
('62', 347, 1, 3, 688816) Ramnarayan also is helping.
('62', 347, 1, 4, 688844) Kishorelal has been ill and suffering a good deal.
('62', 347, 1, 5, 688895) He has been getting fever and it does not leave him.
('62', 347, 1, 6, 688948) Brijkrishna also was seriously ill.
('62', 347, 1, 7, 688984) He is improving now.
('62', 347, 1, 8, 689005) His life was actually in danger.
('62', 347, 1, 9, 689038) But, then, is there anyone of whom that is not true ?
('62', 347, 1, 10, 689092) However, people who are not so ill that they have to remain in bed do not think that their lives are in danger.
('62', 347, 1, 11, 689204) Ba is having a holiday in Yeravda, so to say.
('62', 347, 1, 12, 689250) Dahibehns 1 teeth are giving her trouble.
('62', 347, 1, 13, 689292) Shanta and Lalita are quite well.
('62', 347, 1, 14, 689326) Dwarkanath seems to be managing the affair at Wardha fairly efficiently.
('62', 347, 1, 15, 689399) And there is also Lakshmibehn who, as you know, has identified herself with the Ashram.
('62', 347, 1, 16, 689487) Kaka and Surendra Mashruwala are in Gujarat.

('62', 347, 6, 22, 689701) You should write to me regularly.

('62', 347, 6, 24, 689830) Look after all the children.
('62', 347, 6, 25, 689859) You should not forsake your duty towards Kusum because of anything that Jamna might say or write to you regarding her.
('62', 347, 6, 26, 689978) Even if Kusum loves adornment I would not let her satisfy her desire.
('62', 347, 6, 27, 690048) That is my weakness.
('62', 347, 6, 28, 690069) As for you I cannot imagine that you could love adornment.
('62', 347, 6, 29, 690128) Ask the children to write to me.

('62', 348, 11, 21, 691713) 1 According to the addressee, the contents of this letter were conveyed to Shri Aurobindo through Mother, and Shri Aurobindo wrote in pencil on the note saying : You will have to write that I am unable to see him because for a long time past I have made it an absolute rule not to have any interview with anyonethat I do not even speak with my disciples and only give silent blessings to them three times a year.
('62', 348, 11, 22, 692126) All requests for an interview from others I have been obliged to refuse.
('62', 348, 11, 23, 692199) The rule has been imposed on me by the necessity of my sadhana and is not at all a matter of convenience or anything else.

('62', 349, 1, 4, 692572) I shall continue my efforts to raise money from Bombay.
('62', 349, 1, 5, 692628) In what form a reply should be given about Vithalbhai is a real problem.
('62', 349, 1, 6, 692701) I shall think over it.
('62', 349, 1, 7, 692724) I have not seen Munshis statement.
('62', 349, 1, 8, 692759) He has talked to you.
('62', 349, 1, 9, 692781) He has also told you many other things about himself.
('62', 349, 1, 10, 692835) I have told him to do what he thinks proper.
('62', 349, 1, 11, 692880) I also said that I had no intention at the moment of guiding anybody.
('62', 349, 1, 12, 692950) The newspapers say that Jivraj has taken charge.
('62', 349, 1, 13, 692999) If the reports are correct, congratulate him.
('62', 349, 1, 14, 693045) I was a little worried.

('62', 352, 5, 12, 697594) May God give you peace.
('62', 352, 5, 13, 697618) My tour is progressing satisfactorily though it is quite taxing.
('62', 352, 5, 14, 697683) By the grace of God the body has withstood it so far.
('62', 352, 5, 15, 697737) Bas letters keep coming.
('62', 352, 5, 16, 697762) She is cheerful.

('62', 352, 9, 22, 697937) December 27, 1933 I wish to thank you all for this great reception which is an exhibition of your great affection.
('62', 352, 9, 23, 698052) I thank you for the various purses and addresses including one from the Municipality and another from the District Board.
('62', 352, 9, 24, 698174) You will not expect me to refer to the details of the various addresses in the too short time before me.
('62', 352, 9, 25, 698279) My first and sacred duty is to unveil the portrait of the Lion of the Punjab, the late Lala Lajpat Rai.
('62', 352, 9, 26, 698383) You will not expect me to recount before you his many valuable qualities and services.
('62', 352, 9, 27, 698470) I had the privilege of enjoying his confidence till he died.
('62', 352, 9, 28, 698531) He was the President of the historic session of the Congress in 1920. Today to me and to you the one outstanding quality of his is his unadulterated love for the untouchables.
('62', 352, 9, 29, 698707) He has taught Hindu India to keep to its sense of duty to the so called untouchables, the Harijans.
('62', 352, 9, 30, 698807) Lajpat Rai always
('62', 353, 0, 1, 698825) 354 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('62', 353, 1, 2, 698867) proclaimed that untouch ability was the greatest blot on Hinduism.
('62', 353, 1, 3, 698934) If he had done nothing else, we, Hindus, should revere his sacred memory for his war against untouchability.
('62', 353, 1, 4, 699043) Who can deny his services to the country, his bravery and his fearlessness ?
('62', 353, 1, 5, 699120) It was not by an idle epithet that he was called the Lion of the Punjab.
('62', 353, 1, 6, 699193) I must pass on to other things.
('62', 353, 1, 7, 699225) You will be pleased to know that Mulpuri Chukkamma even from Vellore Jail thought of Harijans and out of her poor belongings she sent me this ring.
('62', 353, 1, 8, 699373) Her letter bearing the signature of the Superintendent of the Central Jail is here with me.
('62', 353, 1, 9, 699465) Who can help deriving inspiration from such acts ?
('62', 353, 2, 10, 699516) Wherever I go, I find evidence of enthusiasm on the part of the people, readiness on their part to open out their hearts to the so called untouchables, the Harijans.
('62', 353, 2, 11, 699682) Wherever I go, I find a readiness on the part of the people to part with their possessions, to part with their coppers, with their silver, with their gold and women are not behind men in making their sacrifices.
('62', 353, 2, 12, 699894) I know for certain that they know for what purpose they have given their bangles or their rings or whatever they hold very dear.
('62', 353, 2, 13, 700023) They know that all these moneys and all these ornaments are being given in order that Harijans may be served.
('62', 353, 2, 14, 700133) This cause, the more I think about it the more I feel, is a cause for all humanity and for all time.
('62', 353, 2, 15, 700234) If Hindus succeed in exorcizing this devil of untouchability, if they succeed in transforming their hearts and if they succeed in purifying themselves of this blot, I have no doubt whatsoever that we, all the communities belonging to different religions, will live in happiness, contentment, peace and real friendship of the heart.
('62', 353, 2, 16, 700566) I have no doubt whatsoever that, if we achieve full success in this mission, in this war against untouchability, as I have said, I have no doubt that we shall be able to achieve the heart unity.
('62', 353, 2, 17, 700761) Suspicions will melt away before the sunshine of mutual trust, mutual affection and mutual respect.
('62', 353, 2, 18, 700861) Let us, therefore, you and I and all, pray to God Almighty that He may bless us with sufficient strength and wisdom to see this error and correct it, no matter what it was.
('62', 353, 2, 19, 701034) Let us remember that all these centuries we have suppressed a portion of ourselves and in so doing we have degraded ourselves, and we have depressed ourselves.
('62', 353, 2, 20, 701194) No power on earth has yet succeeded in suppressing any portion of humanity without degrading itself and without depressing itself.
('62', 353, 2, 21, 701325) The more I see, the more I feel that, if we do not drive away this untouchability, Hinduism itself will perish and it will be a loss not only
('62', 353, 3, 22, 701467) 1 What follows is from The Hindu, 29 12 1933

('62', 354, 1, 2, 701559) to us but it will be a loss to the world.
('62', 354, 1, 3, 701601) A religion that owes its inspiration to the Vedas, to the Upanishads, to the Puranas, to Ramayana, why should that religion perishfor what purpose, for what reason, except that we did not observe the message of the Upanishads, that we did not observe the grand message, the grand proposition enunciated in the pages of the Vedas, the Upanishads that God alone is and no one else and nothing else ?
('62', 354, 1, 4, 701999) Do you suppose the preachers of that one God, God of Justice, preached that there could be any divisions of high and low amongst ourselves ?
('62', 354, 1, 5, 702140) It is an impossible thing.
('62', 354, 1, 6, 702167) The more one thinks about these things, the more it is surprising that a people so cultured as Hindus are supposed to be, should have hugged untouchability as a part of their religion.
('62', 354, 1, 7, 702352) And remember lastly that all the religions in the world are today in the melting pot.
('62', 354, 1, 8, 702438) They are all being critically examined and tested and public opinion will not forgive you and me if we do not energetically drive away this evil from our midst.
('62', 354, 1, 9, 702599) I must not now take any more of your time on untouchability.
('62', 354, 2, 10, 702660) Mr. Gandhi then said that as he was speaking at Ellore, the headquarters of the
('62', 354, 3, 11, 702740) Andhra Provincial Anti untouchability Association, he wished to draw attention to
('62', 354, 4, 12, 702822) the fact that he had received some complaints against some of its office bearers.
('62', 354, 5, 13, 702904) Gandhi said that he and Mr. Thakkar, the vigilant Secretary of the Central Board,
('62', 354, 6, 14, 702986) found after investigation that there was absolutely no foundation for the charges made.
('62', 354, 6, 15, 703074) He always kept his eyes and ears open for receiving any bona fide
('62', 354, 7, 16, 703140) complaints, but he insisted that anybody who complained should do so on two
('62', 354, 8, 17, 703216) conditions.
('62', 354, 8, 18, 703228) Firstly, he must announce his name to the public instead of sending
('62', 354, 9, 19, 703296) anonymous letters and secondly he must substantiate all his allegations by
('62', 354, 10, 20, 703371) unimpeachable evidence.
('62', 354, 11, 21, 703395) Mr. Gandhi delivered his speech in English and before closing he said that it
('62', 354, 12, 22, 703473) was a great regret to him to have done so, even in Andhradesha where Hindi had
('62', 354, 13, 23, 703552) progressed very much.
('62', 354, 13, 24, 703574) He had to speak in English to facilitate translation.
('62', 354, 13, 25, 703628) It would
('62', 354, 14, 26, 703637) not at all be difficult for the Andhras to learn Hindi as many of the words were derived
('62', 354, 15, 27, 703726) from Sanskrit out of which the Telugu language was formed.

('62', 355, 2, 3, 703954) December 28, 1933 The Harijan cause is like fire.
('62', 355, 2, 4, 704004) The more ghee you put into fire, the more it requires.
('62', 355, 2, 5, 704059) So also, the more you give to the Harijan cause, the more it requires.
('62', 355, 2, 6, 704130) Those who give to the cause gain, they never lose; and those who do not give undoubtedly lose.
('62', 355, 2, 7, 704225) What you gain by giving is merit.
('62', 355, 2, 8, 704259) What you lose by not giving is your self.
('62', 355, 2, 9, 704301) For men and women belonging to savarna Hindu castes have been persecuting Harijans now for ages.
('62', 355, 2, 10, 704398) And if we are just now passing through evil times, I am convinced that our treatment of Harijans has not a little to do with it.
('62', 355, 2, 11, 704527) I have, therefore, been asking the women of India to drive away the ghost of untouchability from their hearts.
('62', 355, 2, 12, 704638) It is wrong, it is sinful, to consider some people lower than ourselves.
('62', 355, 2, 13, 704711) On Gods earth nobody is low and nobody is high.
('62', 355, 2, 14, 704759) We are all His creatures; and just as in the eyes of parents all their children are absolutely equal, so also in Gods eyes all His creatures must be equal.
('62', 355, 2, 15, 704915) Therefore I ask you to believe me when I tell you that there is no sanction in religion for untouchability.
('62', 355, 2, 16, 705023) I would, therefore, ask you to give a place in your hearts to all the Harijans around you.
('62', 355, 2, 17, 705114) Welcome Harijan children in your own homes.
('62', 355, 2, 18, 705158) Go to Harijan quarters and look after their children and their homes; speak to Harijan women as to your own sisters.
('62', 355, 2, 19, 705275) This cause of Harijans is essentially for the women of India to tackle; and I hope that you, the Hindu women of this place, will do your duty.
('62', 355, 2, 20, 705418) I hope those of you, who have the wish and the ability to surrender all or any part of your jewellery, will do so.
('62', 355, 2, 21, 705533) There is one condition attached to the gift.
('62', 355, 2, 22, 705578) If you give anything whatsoever, it must not be replaced.
('62', 355, 2, 23, 705636) I want you to feel that you personally have given something to this cause, which you cannot do when you give rupees or notes.
('62', 355, 2, 24, 705762) For they come from either your parents or your husbands.
('62', 355, 2, 25, 705819) But jewellery is your own property.
('62', 355, 2, 26, 705855) When you surrender your jewellery without any intention of having it replaced by your parents or husbands, it is definitely your own sacrifice.
('62', 355, 2, 27, 705999) I want you all who have understood the spirit of the message I have delivered to you to make that definite sacrifice.

('62', 356, 1, 2, 706182) 383. SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, VIZAGAPATAM
('62', 356, 2, 3, 706225) December 28, 1933 You drove me today, on my alighting at the station, through a row of Harijans who were being fed at that time through the charity of some townsman.
('62', 356, 2, 4, 706391) Whilst he may be entitled to thanks for his liberality, I must confess that it was not a soul stirring scene.
('62', 356, 2, 5, 706501) I hung my head in shame as the car was driven through the road along which Harijan men and women were feeding.
('62', 356, 2, 6, 706612) Just imagine how you and I would feel if some insolent person drove his car through the road where we were taking our meals.
('62', 356, 2, 7, 706737) I know the custom under which caste dinners are given.
('62', 356, 2, 8, 706792) All traffic along the road on which dinners are given is entirely prohibited, so that it is possible for diners to have their meals and to be served in perfect peace.
('62', 356, 2, 9, 706959) As I have said repeatedly, this movement of purification goes down to the roots of our hearts.
('62', 356, 2, 10, 707054) I have not asked savarna Hindus to appear as patrons before Harijans and throw the leavings of their dishes to them.
('62', 356, 2, 11, 707171) But I have invited them to open out their hearts to Harijans and to ind there a sanctuary for them.
('62', 356, 2, 12, 707271) But what I saw today was like the act of a patron towards his dependents.
('62', 356, 2, 13, 707345) And do you know, not only my car was driven through the rows of people taking meals, but other cars followed and the crowd also followed these cars.
('62', 356, 2, 14, 707494) And I noticed that it was a hard thing for those poor people to protect their food from dust blowing on it.
('62', 356, 2, 15, 707602) It was not, to say the least, a becoming performance.
('62', 356, 2, 16, 707656) And you can now understand my grief at having been obliged to witness it.
('62', 356, 2, 17, 707730) I know there was no evil intention behind this act.
('62', 356, 2, 18, 707782) I know also that there was not a single person who had any desire to insult these Harijans who were given free meals.
('62', 356, 2, 19, 707900) I understand also that those who took me through that road thought it would please me to drive through the rows of Harijans taking meals.
('62', 356, 2, 20, 708038) I know it was nothing but simple thoughtlessness.
('62', 356, 2, 21, 708088) As we have been told by Shastras, to live a religious life is like walking on the edge of a sword.
('62', 356, 2, 22, 708187) And in a worldwide movement like this of self purification among millions of human beings, a single thoughtless act takes the shape of sin.
('62', 356, 2, 23, 708327) Every act of ours, therefore, in connection with this Harijan movement has to be dictated and dominated by punctiliousness, extreme caution and inward searching.
('62', 356, 2, 24, 708489) Having witnessed this scene, I thought it would be wrong on my part not to make a public reference to it.
('62', 356, 2, 25, 708595) By drawing your attention to it, I have endeavoured to warn the public taking part
('62', 357, 0, 1, 708678) 358 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('62', 357, 1, 2, 708720) in this movement of self purification against a repetition of the scene of this morning.
('62', 357, 1, 3, 708809) This brings me to what we are doing today through the length and breadth of India.
('62', 357, 1, 4, 708892) I have not the shadow of a doubt that untouchability is an unmitigated curse on Hinduism.
('62', 357, 1, 5, 708982) If the Shastras represent the will and wish of God, there can be no warrant whatsoever in them for untouchability, for which you find no parallel in any part of the world save India.
('62', 357, 1, 6, 709165) It is bad enough when dictated by selfish motives to consider ourselves high and other people low.
('62', 357, 1, 7, 709264) But it is not only worse but a double wrong when we tack religion to an evil like untouchability.
('62', 357, 1, 8, 709362) It, therefore, grieves me when learned pundits come forward and invoke the authority of the Shastras for a patent evil like untouchability.
('62', 357, 1, 9, 709502) I have said, and I repeat today, that we, Hindus, are undergoing a period of probation.
('62', 357, 1, 10, 709590) Whether we desire it or not, untouchability is going.
('62', 357, 1, 11, 709644) But if during this period of probation we repent for the sin, if we reform and purify ourselves, history will record that one act as a supreme act of purification on the part of the Hindus.
('62', 357, 1, 12, 709834) But if, through the working of the time spirit, we are compelled to do things against our will and Harijans come to their own, it will be no credit to the Hindus or to Hinduism.
('62', 357, 1, 13, 710012) But I go a step further and say that if we fail in this trial, Hinduism and Hindus will perish.
('62', 357, 1, 14, 710108) Harijan, 5 1 1934

('62', 357, 3, 16, 710137) SOME QUESTIONS It is wonderful how the very same questions are being asked again and again at the different places visited by me and this by those whom one would expect to be readers of Harijan or otherwise to be acquainted with what I have said on those questions.
('62', 357, 3, 17, 710403) But so long as they continue to be asked, I suppose I must deal with them and hope that the readers who are familiar with them will not mind the trespass on these columns.
('62', 357, 3, 18, 710575) I need not repeat the questions.
('62', 357, 3, 19, 710608) The following answers will suggest the kind of questions asked.
('62', 357, 3, 20, 710672) 1. There can be no compulsion in the matter of temple entry.
('62', 357, 3, 21, 710733) 2. No temple wil be opened to Harijans without the approval of a clear majority of trustees or an overwhelming majority of persons believing in temple worship and entitled to use the temple in question
('62', 358, 0, 1, 710935) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 359
('62', 358, 1, 2, 710982) for purposes of worship.
('62', 358, 1, 3, 711007) 3. There is no compulsion whatever in the Temple entry Bill or the Anti untouchability Bill.
('62', 358, 1, 4, 711100) Harijans should be subject to the same rules of admission as are applicable to the other Hindus.
('62', 358, 1, 5, 711197) 4. If anybody satisfies me that the Shastras enjoin untoucha bility as it is observed today, I shall at once give up the agitation.
('62', 358, 1, 6, 711329) 5. But my settled conviction is that modern untouchability is an inhuman institution having its root in selfishness and the desire for exploitation of fellow beings found to be amenable to suppression.
('62', 358, 1, 7, 711531) 6. The untouchables are made and unmade by census enum erators and commissioners as has been abundantly proved in these pages.
('62', 358, 1, 8, 711658) NO TOYS PLEASE Andhradesha easily beats other provinces in presenting toys and the like.
('62', 358, 1, 9, 711747) Some produce little silver cups, some trays, some other fancy things not easily portable.
('62', 358, 1, 10, 711837) I cannot induce buyers on the spot to bid for numerous things and however tempting they may be for the cause, they become a nuisance to carry and keep count of.
('62', 358, 1, 11, 711998) I would, there fore, advise organizers to discountenance, if not forbid, such gifts.
('62', 358, 1, 12, 712083) In several places heavy frames and portraits have been presented.
('62', 358, 1, 13, 712149) They become a positive burden and are unsalable in the market.
('62', 358, 1, 14, 712212) On no account should frames be presented.
('62', 358, 1, 15, 712254) I would like the tour to retain its serious character and be business like involving little or no waste in any matter.
('62', 358, 1, 16, 712373) I may mention incidentally that, in presenting purses, bank notes should be used wherever possible, instead of coins.
('62', 358, 1, 17, 712491) In swift travelling, covering ten to fifteen places in a day, it is difficult to count all the cash from day to day and keep accurate accounts.
('62', 358, 1, 18, 712635) In any case, the accountants, devoted though they are, are over worked and often have to keep late hours in order to keep themselves up to date.
('62', 358, 1, 19, 712780) Big organizations like the All India Harijan Sevak Sangh cannot be effi ciently and yet cheaply conducted without attention to minutest details and without the intelligent co operation of the workers and volunteers taking part in it.

('62', 359, 2, 3, 713103) This Society was established in Calcutta in1923. In the report on the flood relief work in Orissa sent by Sjt.
('62', 359, 2, 4, 713214) Harakhchand and pub lished in the Harijan Sevak, there is a mention of this Societys valuable services.
('62', 359, 2, 5, 713318) On my way to Bezwada from Delhi the other day, some workers of the above Society met me at Palwal station.
('62', 359, 2, 6, 713425) They are helping the flood victims in the district of Gurgaon.
('62', 359, 2, 7, 713488) At the station they gave me a report containing a detailed account of their work and told me : If you read this, you will know that we made no distinction between untouchables and others; in fact we paid special attention to the poor helpless Harijans. The account of the services rendered from November 19, 1933 to December 13, 1933 is to be found in this report.
('62', 359, 2, 8, 713853) The Societys volunteers worked in 144 villages.
('62', 359, 2, 9, 713901) They distributed 2,809 quilts, 1,846 shirts, 1,256 skirts and 872 maunds, 5 seers of grain among 4,098 flood victims.
('62', 359, 2, 10, 714019) They distributed medicines to 3,052 patients suffering from itch, cholera, cough and other maladies.
('62', 359, 2, 11, 714120) Wherever needed, the sick were given milk, barley, sago and other things.
('62', 359, 2, 12, 714194) Houses damaged by floods are being rebuilt.
('62', 359, 2, 13, 714238) The Society is working in seven places: Palwal, Dighout, Bannikheda, Banchari, Hodal, Hasanpur and Gulabad.
('62', 359, 2, 14, 714346) I thank the Society and the young volunteers who are working in the above seven places.
('62', 359, 2, 15, 714434) The number of Harijans and non Hindus helped by the Society is also separately given in the report.
('62', 359, 2, 16, 714534) As long as this pernicious tendency towards discriminating between man and man persists, even in times of common relief operations, so long, unfortunately, separate mention of Hindus, Harijans and non Hindus is and will continue to be necessary in this unfortunate land.

('62', 359, 5, 20, 714889) MANUDI, I felt happy after reading your long letter.
('62', 359, 5, 21, 714942) I daily think about you.
('62', 359, 5, 22, 714967) Tell Kusum that I cannot help her now.
('62', 359, 5, 23, 715006) What will it avail her to think of me ?
('62', 359, 5, 24, 715046) Let her go on repeating Ramanama.

('62', 360, 1, 3, 715159) You should teach her to do that.
('62', 360, 1, 4, 715192) Sing the Ramadhun to her.
('62', 360, 1, 5, 715218) You can sing many bhajans.
('62', 360, 1, 6, 715245) What can I say to comfort aunt Bali ?
('62', 360, 1, 7, 715283) If I were free from other duties, I would go to her and help her run her home and free her from her worries.
('62', 360, 1, 8, 715392) But it is impossible during this life that I can even stand in such relation to her.
('62', 360, 1, 9, 715477) What you write about death is perfectly true.
('62', 360, 1, 10, 715523) It will come to all of us sooner or later.

('62', 360, 5, 25, 716356) I have had no letters from Santok for some time.
('62', 360, 5, 26, 716405) You did well in meeting Jamnalalji.
('62', 360, 5, 27, 716441) Have you learnt the Marwari speech ?

('62', 360, 5, 29, 716538) Besides Om, Kisanbehn is accompanying me.
('62', 360, 5, 30, 716580) Has Om written to you about her ?
('62', 360, 5, 31, 716614) She is a friend of Prema behns.
('62', 360, 5, 32, 716646) I have caught cold.

('62', 361, 4, 7, 716915) Om and Kisan are quite happy.
('62', 361, 4, 8, 716945) Kisan probably does not remember you.
('62', 361, 4, 9, 716983) What did you do at Banaras?
('62', 361, 4, 10, 717011) I am sure you will have met Sumangal.

('62', 361, 9, 16, 717206) MY DEAR ALVA,
('62', 361, 10, 17, 717220) When I tell you that I am writing this between 3 and 4 a.m., before the morning prayer, you will understand the pressure under which I have to cope with my correspondence.
('62', 361, 10, 18, 717392) That is the reason for the delay in replying to your letter.
('62', 361, 10, 19, 717453) It was good of you to let me have that excellent letter.
('62', 361, 10, 20, 717510) I suppose you do know that I tried to meet you at Yeravda and then you were removed.
('62', 361, 10, 21, 717595) I trust you are a regular reader of Harijan.

('62', 362, 2, 3, 717913) CUDDAPAH STATION, January 1, 1934
('62', 362, 3, 4, 717947) BA, Send me a copy of the discourse I sent you last time.
('62', 362, 3, 5, 718005) 1 I got your letter only today.
('62', 362, 3, 6, 718037) I am writing this letter on my silence day.
('62', 362, 3, 7, 718081) Do not worry about Manilal.
('62', 362, 3, 8, 718109) I am sending your letter to him.
('62', 362, 3, 9, 718142) You need not get alarmed by what Pragji said.
('62', 362, 3, 10, 718188) Both are mature persons.
('62', 362, 3, 11, 718213) If they have made a mistake they will correct it.
('62', 362, 3, 12, 718263) Arrangement has already been made for jame e jamshed.
('62', 362, 3, 13, 718317) Mathuradas informs me that this has been done, and so I have done nothing further about it.
('62', 362, 3, 14, 718409) I hope you get it now.
('62', 362, 3, 15, 718432) All the same, I am inquiring again.
('62', 362, 3, 16, 718468) I will try about the Rama yana and the Bhagavata.
('62', 362, 3, 17, 718518) Dont feel the slightest hesitation in writing to Premlilabehn for anything you want.
('62', 362, 3, 18, 718603) After all, what are you likely to want ?
('62', 362, 3, 19, 718644) What few things you want she will send with great love.
('62', 362, 3, 20, 718700) But about anything which you do not require immediately, it will be enough if you write to me.
('62', 362, 3, 21, 718795) I will then make the necessary arrange ments.
('62', 362, 3, 22, 718841) Can you use your dentures ?
('62', 362, 3, 23, 718869) Do you gargle with potassium permanganate water ?
('62', 362, 3, 24, 718919) Thakkar Bapa is not in the party with me this time.
('62', 362, 3, 25, 718971) He will meet me on the 15th.
('62', 362, 3, 26, 719000) Just now Malkani is with me.
('62', 362, 3, 27, 719029) He also is working very hard, along with the others.
('62', 362, 3, 28, 719082) Chandra shankar keeps fairly good health.
('62', 362, 3, 29, 719124) Om and Kisan are taking good care of their health.
('62', 362, 3, 30, 719175) Om works as hard as she can.
('62', 362, 3, 31, 719204) She is a simple hearted and straightforward girl.
('62', 362, 3, 32, 719254) And so is Kisan.
('62', 362, 3, 33, 719271) Surendra has regained his strength.
('62', 362, 3, 34, 719307) The Andhra tour ends on the 3rd.
('62', 362, 3, 35, 719340) After that we shall go to Mysore.
('62', 362, 3, 36, 719374) Wherever I go, there is bound to be a lot of activity and some hardships too.
('62', 362, 3, 37, 719452) But I am carefully protected by everybody and so dont feel the hardships much.
('62', 362, 3, 38, 719531) As Mirabehn looks after the smallest detail, I dont feel the discomfort of travelling at all.
('62', 362, 3, 39, 719625) You will be permitted to receive a letter from me every week only if you forgo your right of receiving visitors.
('62', 362, 3, 40, 719738) I for one will go on sending a discourse every week.
('62', 362, 3, 41, 719791) Be satisfied with visitors who come to see the other women.
('62', 362, 3, 42, 719851) However, do as you wish.
('62', 362, 3, 43, 719876) If you are keen on having visitors, there would be many ready to go.
('62', 362, 3, 44, 719945) They would even wish to go.
('62', 362, 3, 45, 719973) We have deliberately made it a practice to receive the fewest

('62', 363, 1, 2, 720122) possible visitors.
('62', 363, 1, 3, 720141) But let me know your wish without any hesitation.
('62', 363, 1, 4, 720191) Janakibehn is all right.
('62', 363, 1, 5, 720216) I think I have already written to you about her son Ramakrishnas tonsils being removed.
('62', 363, 1, 6, 720304) Kamala has now resumed solid foods.
('62', 363, 1, 7, 720340) Kishorelal is still not free from fever.
('62', 363, 1, 8, 720381) But there is no cause for worry.
('62', 363, 1, 9, 720414) These days my silence commences on Sunday night.
('62', 363, 1, 10, 720463) I, therefore, dont speak till Monday night.
('62', 363, 1, 11, 720507) The silence will be broken today at ten minutes past nine.
('62', 363, 1, 12, 720566) Hence I shall hardly have to speak to anybody, since soon after it will be time to go to bed.
('62', 363, 1, 13, 720660) I have to get up at three in the morning.
('62', 363, 1, 14, 720702) Brijkrishnas fever has come down.
('62', 363, 1, 15, 720736) But he has yet to regain strength.
('62', 363, 1, 16, 720771) Hemibehn is no more.
('62', 363, 1, 17, 720792) Now the discourse.
('62', 363, 1, 18, 720811) Last time I wrote about the attributes of a bhakta.
('62', 363, 1, 19, 720863) I also explained that there could be no bhakti without service.
('62', 363, 1, 20, 720927) This time I will write about how one can serve, since people frequently ask me that question.
('62', 363, 1, 21, 721021) Some say that service is possible only under certain conditions.
('62', 363, 1, 22, 721086) Some others that it is possible only after certain studies.
('62', 363, 1, 23, 721146) I explained last week that these were wrong notions.
('62', 363, 1, 24, 721199) One can serve under any conditions.
('62', 363, 1, 25, 721235) If we offer up to Shri Krishna all our gifts and possessions, we shall get full marks.
('62', 363, 1, 26, 721322) Anybody who can give one crore but gives only half a crore, will not get more than 50 marks.
('62', 363, 1, 27, 721415) But he who has only one pie and gives it will get 100 marks.
('62', 363, 1, 28, 721476) If, therefore, you and the other women prisoners there behave in this manner towards the women with whom you come into contact or towards the officials, you are fufilling the dharma of service.
('62', 363, 1, 29, 721670) Behaving towards the officials in the spirit of service means never wishing them ill, showing them due respect and not deceiving them.
('62', 363, 1, 30, 721805) All the rules should be obeyed and the women undergoing imprisonment for criminal offen ces should be treated as if they were your blood sisters.
('62', 363, 1, 31, 721951) If you let them feel your love and see your purity of heart, that also will mean practising the dharma of service.
('62', 363, 1, 32, 722066) In both cases ones motives must be clean.
('62', 363, 1, 33, 722108) If a person behaves in a good way with a selfish motive or through fear, his actions cannot be reckoned as service.
('62', 363, 1, 34, 722224) We often see one person doing a thing with a selfish motive and another doing the same thing with a benevolent motive.
('62', 363, 1, 35, 722343) There can be no room for self interest in anything done as an offering to the Lord.
('62', 363, 1, 36, 722427) One who serves in this manner daily gains more strength.
('62', 363, 1, 37, 722484) His studies and his work, both are inspired by the motive of service.
('62', 363, 1, 38, 722554) Even the laughing or playing,eating or drinking of a person who is thus dedicated to service are informed with the spirit of service.
('62', 363, 1, 39, 722688) All his actions, therefore, will be innocent.
('62', 363, 1, 40, 722734) The Lord always gives to such bhaktas the strength they need.
('62', 363, 1, 41, 722796) You probably remember the three verses in the womens prayer
('62', 364, 0, 1, 722856) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 365
('62', 364, 1, 2, 722903) which have a bearing on this.
('62', 364, 1, 3, 722933) They are as follows :
('62', 364, 2, 4, 722955) As for those who worship Me, thinking on Me alone and nothing else, ever attached to me, I bear the burden of getting them what they need.
('62', 364, 3, 5, 723094) With Me in their thoughts, their whole soul devoted to Me, teaching one another, with Me ever on their lips, they live in contentment and joy 2
('62', 364, 4, 6, 723238) To these, ever in tune with Me, worshipping Me with affectionate devotion, I give the power of selfless action, whereby they come to Me !
('62', 364, 5, 7, 723376) Refer to the Anasaktiyog for the meaning of these verses.
('62', 364, 5, 8, 723434) You will find them in Chapters 9 and 10. Remember that we read the Gita to put its teaching into practice.
('62', 364, 5, 9, 723541) All that I have said above is, you should know, on the basis of the Gita.

('62', 364, 10, 21, 724105) You should ask him and find out.
('62', 364, 10, 22, 724138) One need not hesitate to ask ones father about his financial condition.

('62', 365, 5, 17, 725390) January 1, 1934
('62', 365, 6, 18, 725406) MANILAL AND SUSHILA, I have not yet received the letter which is due from you.
('62', 365, 6, 19, 725485) I hope you got the long letters which I wrote to you.
('62', 365, 6, 20, 725539) Ba is worrying about you a great deal in jail.
('62', 365, 6, 21, 725586) She has been upset by some things that Pragji has said.
('62', 365, 6, 22, 725642) She believes that you, Manilal, have quarrelled with every body there.
('62', 365, 6, 23, 725713) I do not believe this, of course.
('62', 365, 6, 24, 725747) I merely write what Ba has written to me.
('62', 365, 6, 25, 725789) She has asked me to convey her exact words.
('62', 365, 6, 26, 725833) Since she is in jail and can write only one letter, I naturally feel that I should satisfy her wishes, whatever they are.
('62', 365, 6, 27, 725955) That is the only reason why I have mentioned this.
('62', 365, 7, 28, 726006) I keep very good health.
('62', 365, 7, 29, 726031) The details are always given in Harijan.
('62', 365, 7, 30, 726072) Nanabhai continues to be in poor health.
('62', 365, 7, 31, 726113) Kishorelal has been having fever for a long time and it does not go.
('62', 365, 7, 32, 726182) I inquire and get reports about him regularly.
('62', 365, 7, 33, 726229) I trust he will be all right in a few days.
('62', 365, 7, 34, 726273) Santoks mother has passed away.
('62', 365, 7, 35, 726305) Kashis sister, Hemi, is also dead.
('62', 365, 7, 36, 726340) Devdas is well.
('62', 365, 7, 37, 726356) After his release, he will go to Madras to be with Lakshmi at the time of her delivery.
('62', 365, 7, 38, 726444) I dont think it is necessary for me now to write anything about the differences among you there.

('62', 366, 5, 9, 726929) I shall certainly be happy if you join me.
('62', 366, 5, 10, 726972) If you find it convenient, you may complete the whole tour.
('62', 366, 5, 11, 727032) Our mode of living is, of course, simple.
('62', 366, 5, 12, 727074) We travel by third class and work hard day and night.
('62', 366, 5, 13, 727128) We have to do physical work and make do with whatever food and accommodation we get.
('62', 366, 5, 14, 727213) If you are physically strong and if your mode of living is simple, you will feel no hardship.
('62', 366, 5, 15, 727307) If you have the courage, come and have this experience.
('62', 366, 5, 16, 727363) I would certainly welcome a young man of your ability and straightforwardness.
('62', 366, 5, 17, 727442) Send a wire if you decide to come.
('62', 366, 5, 18, 727477) We shall be touring in Mysore State for about seven days.
('62', 366, 5, 19, 727535) If, therefore, you come, buy a ticket for Bangalore.
('62', 366, 5, 20, 727588) You will know there where I am touring.
('62', 366, 5, 21, 727628) Send a telegram to me at Bangalore.
('62', 366, 5, 22, 727664) I will get it wherever I am and will make the necessary arrangements.
('62', 366, 5, 23, 727734) Someone will meet you at Bangalore station.
('62', 366, 5, 24, 727778) You will not be stranded even if the telegram does not reach me.

('62', 366, 9, 29, 727959) SURENDRA, I learn that you started crying and returned to Bombay out of fear of being beaten.
('62', 366, 9, 30, 728053) There is no reason for you to feel upset or ashamed about it.
('62', 366, 9, 31, 728115) Have you not read how scared I used to be at the age of seventeen or eighteen ?
('62', 366, 9, 32, 728195) I would however also advise you not to go to jail out of a false sense of shame.
('62', 366, 9, 33, 728276) This time a few will have to go to jail repeatedly.

('62', 367, 1, 3, 728439) Serve there and go to jail when God prompts you and gives you full courage.
('62', 367, 1, 4, 728515) Remember that God always gives the strength to bear physical pain to those who have surrendered them selves completely to him.
('62', 367, 1, 5, 728642) But such strength is not acquired by thinking.
('62', 367, 1, 6, 728689) It is a gift from God, which His devotees invariably receive.
('62', 367, 1, 7, 728751) Follow the course which you find the easiest for yourself.

('62', 367, 7, 13, 728969) VIDYA, I have your letter.
('62', 367, 7, 14, 728996) It is not a reply to my letter.
('62', 367, 7, 15, 729028) Perhaps you got it late.
('62', 367, 7, 16, 729053) I was of course confident that Kakaji would send you a reply and that too a good one.
('62', 367, 7, 17, 729139) If you have to go to Karachi, then do travel alone in daytime.
('62', 367, 7, 18, 729202) Do not fear anyone.
('62', 367, 7, 19, 729222) Have faith that God is there to protect us.
('62', 367, 7, 20, 729266) I want to see you fearless, industrious, sociable and physically strong.
('62', 367, 7, 21, 729339) And I have no doubt that you can be.
('62', 367, 7, 22, 729376) How is Mahadev ?
('62', 367, 7, 23, 729393) How much milk does he take ?
('62', 367, 7, 24, 729422) Does he trouble you now ?
('62', 367, 7, 25, 729448) Do you take him for outing ?
('62', 367, 7, 26, 729477) What is the news about Anand ?
('62', 367, 7, 27, 729508) What do you study ?
('62', 367, 7, 28, 729528) Read Hindi books daily.
('62', 367, 7, 29, 729552) Study English also as much as possible.

('62', 369, 1, 2, 731342) I have been writing to Ba every week and will continue to do so.
('62', 369, 1, 3, 731407) As desired by her, I send her some discourses on the Gita just as I used to do from Yeravda Mandir.
('62', 369, 1, 4, 731507) Mahadev is now permitted to write and receive only one letter.
('62', 369, 1, 5, 731570) He tries to include several in one.
('62', 369, 1, 6, 731606) He will get others letters through Jivanji.
('62', 369, 1, 7, 731650) He is being tested severely indeed.
('62', 369, 1, 8, 731686) I am sure he will get an M.A. degree even in this.
('62', 369, 1, 9, 731737) He is buried in the translation of the Gita.
('62', 369, 1, 10, 731782) You know Kishorelals condition.
('62', 369, 1, 11, 731814) He refuses to part with his fever.

('62', 369, 2, 13, 731911) Swami and Gomati.
('62', 369, 2, 14, 731929) He will abide by their advice.
('62', 369, 2, 15, 731960) I got a letter from Ba yesterday.
('62', 369, 2, 16, 731994) Om made copies of it, one of which I am sending to you.
('62', 369, 2, 17, 732050) Om is a very active girl.
('62', 369, 2, 18, 732076) Besides, she is eager to learn everything as quickly as she can.
('62', 369, 2, 19, 732141) Being frank and truth ful, she is progressing very well.
('62', 369, 2, 20, 732198) Kisans health is not as good as it used to be.
('62', 369, 2, 21, 732245) Otherwise she also is a hard worker.
('62', 369, 2, 22, 732282) Both the girls are extremely simple in their habits.
('62', 369, 2, 23, 732335) They have become intimate friends.
('62', 369, 2, 24, 732370) Radhakant Malaviya came yesterday to see me.
('62', 369, 2, 25, 732415) He has brought with him a scheme for preserving milk in dry ice and wants my help in carrying it out.
('62', 369, 2, 26, 732517) But to ask for my help in such an enterprise is as futile as to churn sand for butter.
('62', 369, 2, 27, 732604) Probably you know that he has been to England for practical training.
('62', 369, 2, 28, 732674) Malkani has been working very hard.
('62', 369, 2, 29, 732710) He is filling Thakkar Bapas place well enough.
('62', 369, 2, 30, 732757) The entire staff works sincerely and leaves nothing to be desired.

('62', 371, 1, 6, 735449) My letter to any one of you should be regarded as letters to all.
('62', 371, 1, 7, 735515) By the time you are discharged I shall be travelling in the ex treme south of India.
('62', 371, 1, 8, 735600) If you think that it is worth while coming all the way merely to see me, you shall come.
('62', 371, 1, 9, 735689) I would strongly advise you to restrain yourself and do all the talking through corres pondence.
('62', 371, 1, 10, 735786) Of course you should see your mother and also Narandas.
('62', 371, 1, 11, 735842) They are both within easy reach.
('62', 371, 1, 12, 735875) But the final decision rests with you.
('62', 371, 1, 13, 735914) My advice to all the others is just what I am giving to you.
('62', 371, 1, 14, 735975) I am glad you have kept so well.
('62', 371, 1, 15, 736008) I have heard about Velanbehn and Durgabehn, also Lilavati.
('62', 371, 1, 16, 736067) They must all write to me when they are discharged.
('62', 371, 1, 17, 736119) I hope you have all made the best use of your time.
('62', 371, 1, 18, 736171) My health is excellent.
('62', 371, 1, 19, 736195) The last weight was 108 lb.
('62', 371, 1, 20, 736223) My food is milk and oranges and one green vegetable plain boiled without salt.
('62', 371, 1, 21, 736302) I take other fruit when it easily comes my way.
('62', 371, 1, 22, 736350) This is either fresh grapes or pomegranate.
('62', 371, 1, 23, 736394) Generally speaking I take no dates at present.
('62', 371, 1, 24, 736441) I do not seem to need them.
('62', 371, 1, 25, 736469) My work commences at 3 a.m.
('62', 371, 1, 26, 736497) and ends generally at 9 p.m.
('62', 371, 1, 27, 736526) Of course I try to get some sleep in the middle of the day.
('62', 371, 1, 28, 736586) Your Hindi writing as also your Gujarati is not bad.
('62', 371, 1, 29, 736639) I hope the Ramadan fast has not weakened you.
('62', 371, 1, 30, 736685) Has Amina been taking it ?
('62', 371, 1, 31, 736712) Tell her I often receive news about her children who are getting on nicely.
('62', 371, 1, 32, 736788) I have just got a report from their Urdu teacher.
('62', 371, 1, 33, 736838) Love to you all BAPU [PS.]

('62', 372, 2, 3, 737019) January 2, 1934
('62', 372, 3, 4, 737035) DEAR SATIS BABU, Your letter of 30th ultimo has given me much relief.
('62', 372, 3, 5, 737105) The money you have recieved was meant to ease some pressure.
('62', 372, 3, 6, 737166) It was the utmost that could be given to you.
('62', 372, 3, 7, 737212) I hope your workers will succeed.
('62', 372, 3, 8, 737246) It is most exacting and exasperating work.
('62', 372, 3, 9, 737289) They must be prepared to take insults as cheerfully as they would take cheques and bank notes.
('62', 372, 3, 10, 737384) I like the idea of Dr. Roy personally fixing the tour programme.
('62', 372, 3, 11, 737449) I see in the papers received today that he had a serious accident.
('62', 372, 3, 12, 737516) I hope it is not so serious as reported.
('62', 372, 3, 13, 737557) I have wired but you will give me full details.
('62', 372, 3, 14, 737605) I am glad you have regained your weight.
('62', 372, 3, 15, 737646) But 128 is not enough for your build.
('62', 372, 3, 16, 737684) There is no reason why you should not have your fine muscles which you used to have before.
('62', 372, 3, 17, 737776) Regarding the body as Gods instrument, you are bound to keep it as fit as it is possible to keep it consistently with the obvious and necessary limits.
('62', 372, 3, 18, 737928) I hope Arun 1 is doing well.
('62', 372, 3, 19, 737957) He has to attend on me when I tour in Bengal.
('62', 372, 3, 20, 738003) But he wont be allowed if he is in a weak state of health.
('62', 372, 3, 21, 738062) BAPU [PS.] What about Bengali Harijan ?

('62', 372, 7, 26, 738216) By Gods grace everything will turn out well.
('62', 372, 7, 27, 738261) I came to know only yesterday that Lakshmi 3 is expecting.
('62', 372, 7, 28, 738320) I have advised that if Manjukeshabehn offers to shoulder the responsibility,

('62', 373, 1, 2, 738637) Lakshmi may go to Bardoli for her delivery, otherwise she should get herself admitted in the Vadilal Hospital at Ahmedabad.
('62', 373, 1, 3, 738761) It has all the facilities, and some Ashram women also are working in it and they will be able to look after her.
('62', 373, 1, 4, 738874) Let me know if you have any suggestion to make in this regard.
('62', 373, 1, 5, 738937) I will decide finally after I hear from Maruti 1 and Laskhmi.
('62', 373, 1, 6, 738999) I have made the necessary arrangements for you to get a copy of the Harijanbandhu.
('62', 373, 1, 7, 739082) Let me know if you do not get it.
('62', 373, 1, 8, 739116) What help did Sunderjibhai give ?
('62', 373, 1, 9, 739150) Let me have his address.
('62', 373, 1, 10, 739175) I have forgotten it completely.
('62', 373, 1, 11, 739207) A girls hostel is being run in the Sabarmati Harijan Ashram.
('62', 373, 1, 12, 739268) Are you willing to send the girls there ?
('62', 373, 1, 13, 739310) If yes, I may inquire.
('62', 373, 1, 14, 739333) They may admit them there.

('62', 373, 5, 21, 739580) MATHURADAS, I spoke to Shankaran.
('62', 373, 5, 22, 739614) I also had a talk with a lawyer who is a good man.
('62', 373, 5, 23, 739665) We came to the decision that Sasmals help should be sought.
('62', 373, 5, 24, 739725) Calling upon the services of a lawyer from outside is correct.
('62', 373, 5, 25, 739788) There are few lawyers in Madras handling criminal cases, and such as there are, are not of the first rank.
('62', 373, 5, 26, 739895) That is why people have to look outside.
('62', 373, 5, 27, 739936) But you have nothing to do right now.
('62', 373, 5, 28, 739974) If there is anything, I shall let you know.
('62', 373, 5, 29, 740018) Tell Shankaran that as he has met me, you are not required to do anything.
('62', 373, 5, 30, 740093) As for Bas inquiry, I am not aware of any good books in Gujarati except Tribhuvandass Nani Shikhaman.
('62', 373, 5, 31, 740195) A book of this kind is needed for Marutis Lakshmi.
('62', 373, 5, 32, 740246) Do you know of any such book?
('62', 373, 5, 33, 740276) Write to me if you know of any.
('62', 373, 5, 34, 740308) Which is the best book of this kind in English?
('62', 373, 5, 35, 740356) Consult Jivaraj.

('62', 374, 5, 14, 740951) Khadi too is in the hands of Rama.
('62', 374, 5, 15, 740986) Khadi will flourish if it has Rama in it and that is possible only when we have Rama in us.
('62', 374, 5, 16, 741078) Let us therefore make all efforts for khadi but let us not worry about it.
('62', 374, 5, 17, 741153) Rama will do the worrying.
('62', 374, 5, 18, 741180) The right to worry is His only, our dharma is but to serve.
('62', 374, 5, 19, 741240) The less you worry, the greater will be the success.

('62', 374, 8, 24, 741440) CUDDAPAH, January 2, 1934 2
('62', 374, 9, 25, 741468) GANDHIJI : The Harijan movement goes to the root of the evil.
('62', 374, 9, 26, 741530) If untouchability goes, the castes as we know them today go.
('62', 374, 10, 27, 741591) HARIJAN WORKERS : Surely not.
('62', 374, 11, 28, 741621) G. I talk of the extreme form of untouchability.
('62', 374, 11, 29, 741670) But the evil is so widespread that in some form or other it runs through the whole Hindu social system and corrupts it.
('62', 374, 11, 30, 741790) The distinction of high and low is

('62', 374, 13, 32, 741870) 2 Extracted from Chandrashankar Shuklas Weekly Letter 3 A Harijan worker had asked whether Gandhiji wanted the caste system to
('62', 375, 0, 1, 741997) 376 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('62', 375, 1, 2, 742039) at the bottom of untouchability.
('62', 375, 1, 3, 742072) If the extreme form goes, the rest is bound to go.
('62', 375, 1, 4, 742123) If it does not, our movement will be a mere camouflage.
('62', 375, 1, 5, 742179) So long as the idea of high and low is not abolished, untouchability cannot be said to have been abolished.
('62', 375, 2, 6, 742287) H. W. What, then, of the varna which you seek to defend ?
('62', 375, 3, 7, 742345) But you must know my definition of it.
('62', 375, 3, 8, 742384) It is as different from the present caste system as chalk is from cheese.
('62', 375, 3, 9, 742458) Varna say I understand it is an economic law which operates, whether we know it or not.
('62', 375, 3, 10, 742546) Conformation to it will bring happiness to man kind.
('62', 375, 3, 11, 742599) Disregard for it is disrupting society today all over the world.
('62', 375, 3, 12, 742664) Varna is the antithesis of the doctrine of might is right.
('62', 375, 3, 13, 742723) It abolishes all distinctions between high and low.
('62', 375, 4, 14, 742775) H. W. But nobody gives the meaning you give to varna.
('62', 375, 4, 15, 742829) G. That may be.
('62', 375, 4, 16, 742845) Evolution of human thought is evolution of the meaning of words.
('62', 375, 4, 17, 742910) I have no difficulty in seeing my meaning in the original mantra from which the theory of varna is derived, 1 nor in the Gita verses referring to varna.
('62', 375, 4, 18, 743063) 2. Regulations about dining and marriage have no direct connection with varna.
('62', 375, 4, 19, 743142) The distinguishing feature of varna is occupation.
('62', 375, 5, 20, 743193) H. W. Then you will restrict everyone to his fathers occupation ?
('62', 375, 6, 21, 743259) G. Neither I nor anybody else can impose the restriction on anyone.
('62', 375, 6, 22, 743327) Varnadharma is not a man made law to be imposed or relaxed at his will.
('62', 375, 6, 23, 743399) It is natural to man in his regenerate state.
('62', 375, 6, 24, 743445) He may disregard it to his cost.
('62', 375, 6, 25, 743478) Everyone is free to follow or disobey it.
('62', 375, 6, 26, 743520) It was discovered in India and followed more or less faithfully and knowingly for centuries.
('62', 375, 6, 27, 743613) It is being followed ignorantly and helplessly even now by the bulk of the people.
('62', 375, 6, 28, 743696) In the eye of that law, Brahmin and Bhangi are absolutely on an equal footing.
('62', 375, 6, 29, 743775) A Bhangi who does his work willingly and faithfully will find favour with God.
('62', 375, 6, 30, 743854) A Brahmin who, no matter how learned he may be, does not follow his calling will incur divine displeasure.
('62', 375, 6, 31, 743961) The law does not confer privileges, it defines duties.
('62', 375, 6, 32, 744016) Truest democracy can be evolved only by a due recognition of and obedience to the law.
('62', 375, 6, 33, 744103) Thus, in my opinion, there is no evil in varna.
('62', 375, 6, 34, 744151) The evil consists in considering one varna as higher than another.
('62', 375, 7, 35, 744218) H. W. Surely, the varna that you describe exists only in your imagination !
('62', 375, 7, 36, 744294) What we see around us is the solid fact of hundreds of castes, each claiming to be higher than some other.
('62', 375, 8, 37, 744401) 1 Rigveda, x, Purushasukta 2 Vide, for instance, Bhagavad Gita, IV.

('62', 376, 1, 2, 744516) G. That is unfortunately so.
('62', 376, 1, 3, 744545) I am simply answering your question and showing you the vital difference between caste and varna.
('62', 376, 1, 4, 744643) Castes are a human manufacture, are daily weakening and have to go.
('62', 376, 1, 5, 744711) Varna as defined by me may be said to exist in my imagination.
('62', 376, 1, 6, 744774) Its definition is not imaginary.
('62', 376, 1, 7, 744807) It is inherent in the mantra on which it is based and is given in so many words in the Bhagavad Gita.

('62', 376, 4, 11, 744984) Replying to the addresses 1 and acknowledging the purse and other presents, Gandhiji said that the Cuddapah Municipality built beautiful houses for the Harijans under their employ.
('62', 376, 4, 12, 745165) The quarters were kept clean and tidy.
('62', 376, 4, 13, 745204) He was very glad to find a co operatvie society and a temple in their midst, and adequate water facilities.
('62', 376, 5, 14, 745312) This place is well worth a visit.
('62', 376, 5, 15, 745346) I congratulate the Municipality on having provided to the most useful servants of the town quarters the like of which I have not so far seen anywhere during the tour.
('62', 376, 5, 16, 745513) I wish other municipalities would follow your example.
('62', 376, 6, 17, 745568) Gandhiji then appealed to the audience to co operate with him wholeheartedly in ameliorating the conditions of Harijans.

('62', 376, 9, 21, 745802) JAMNALAL, I got your letter written from Calcutta.
('62', 376, 9, 22, 745853) I could not judge from the letter whether or not you had met Satis Babu during your stay there.
('62', 376, 9, 23, 745949) I suppose you did meet him.
('62', 376, 9, 24, 745977) You havent mentioned anything about your health, either.
('62', 376, 9, 25, 746034) Write about it in your next letter.
('62', 376, 9, 26, 746070) The fact that Shivprasad escaped unhurt is indeed a remarkable thing.
('62', 376, 9, 27, 746140) The tour is progressing very well.
('62', 376, 9, 28, 746175) My body is standing the strain better than I had expected.
('62', 376, 9, 29, 746234) There is, therefore, no cause at all for worry.
('62', 376, 9, 30, 746282) Om is doing well enough.
('62', 376, 9, 31, 746307) She is not a girl who will let others worry for her.
('62', 376, 9, 32, 746360) She is slowly getting trained for the position of secretary.

('62', 377, 1, 3, 746788) I ask her to do only as much work as she can do without strain.
('62', 377, 1, 4, 746852) I am sure you know that Kisan is accom panying me.
('62', 377, 1, 5, 746903) She is a very good girl.
('62', 377, 1, 6, 746928) She has become very friendly with Om.
('62', 377, 1, 7, 746966) Her health went down in jail.
('62', 377, 1, 8, 746996) Before that she was fairly strong and was quite smart.
('62', 377, 1, 9, 747051) The tour seems to have benefited her.
('62', 377, 1, 10, 747089) At present Malkani is with me.
('62', 377, 1, 11, 747120) I neednt say anything about him.
('62', 377, 1, 12, 747153) He is working hard.
('62', 377, 1, 13, 747173) Damodar is working satisfactorily.
('62', 377, 1, 14, 747208) He has proved his sincerity and capacity.
('62', 377, 1, 15, 747250) Did you send the sum which was to be sent to Delhi from the Harijan account ?
('62', 377, 1, 16, 747328) Gosibehn will have to be paid something every month.
('62', 377, 1, 17, 747381) Pay that also from some account.
('62', 377, 1, 18, 747414) Pay her what Mathuradas suggests.
('62', 377, 1, 19, 747448) She should have been given the full amount from Bombay, but the people there are not giving it.
('62', 377, 1, 20, 747544) I will write now, but while the correspondence is going on she must get the amount from somewhere.
('62', 377, 1, 21, 747643) Blessings from BAPU PS.
('62', 377, 1, 22, 747667) Before Morning Prayer, Wednesday How is it that Janakibehn complains against your temper ?
('62', 377, 1, 23, 747758) If there is any truth in her complaint, overcome your weakness.
('62', 377, 1, 24, 747822) I asked Om and she also tells me that sometimes you make even Madan Mohan weep.
('62', 377, 1, 25, 747902) Tara has always been a sincere worker.
('62', 377, 1, 26, 747941) If she keeps good health she will fully prove her worth.
('62', 377, 1, 27, 747998) I had a wire from Dr. Sharma (of Delhi).
('62', 377, 1, 28, 748039) He has sold his property for Rs. 10,000 and paid off his debt.
('62', 377, 1, 29, 748102) Now he wishes to come and live in the Ashram.
('62', 377, 1, 30, 748148) He will come with his wife.
('62', 377, 1, 31, 748176) I have advised him to write to you.
('62', 377, 1, 32, 748212) I think he should be taken in.
('62', 377, 1, 33, 748243) If he proves worthy, well and good.
('62', 377, 1, 34, 748279) Otherwise he will be asked to leave the Ashram.
('62', 377, 1, 35, 748327) I hope you work with due regard to your health.

('62', 378, 1, 2, 748720) would not have any objection for earmarking the sum 1 for the Kesava Vidyanilayam a residential school for Harijans in memory of the late lamented P. Kesava Pillai provided a workable scheme and workers were forthcoming.
('62', 378, 1, 3, 748941) The moneys that were collected would of course be spent for imparting education to Harijans and providing other facilities for their uplift.
('62', 378, 1, 4, 749082) Neither grants of money nor mere removal of physical untouchability were sufficient to complete the process of purification which the savarna ought to undergo to atone for their past sins and neglect.
('62', 378, 1, 5, 749283) What was necessary was to banish the very idea of distinction between high and low, touchable and untouchable from their thought.
('62', 378, 1, 6, 749413) This was easy if people could control their mind.
('62', 378, 1, 7, 749463) But generally the reverse was true and hence the difficulty.
('62', 378, 1, 8, 749524) Hinduism would suffer extinction if untouchability continued to exist.
('62', 378, 1, 9, 749595) He prayed the Almighty to give them the will and courage to serve the Harijan cause and remove the evil.

('62', 378, 4, 13, 749786) The real ornament of woman is her character, her purity.
('62', 378, 4, 14, 749843) Metal and stones can never be real ornaments.
('62', 378, 4, 15, 749889) The names of women like Sita and Damayanti have become sacred to us for their unsullied virtue, never for their jewellery, if they wore any.
('62', 378, 4, 16, 750030) My asking from you your jewellery has also a wider significance.
('62', 378, 4, 17, 750095) Several sisters have told me that they feel all the better for getting rid of their jewels.
('62', 378, 5, 18, 750187) I have called this an act of merit in more ways than one.
('62', 378, 5, 19, 750245) No man or woman is entitled to the possession of wealth, unless he or she has given a fair share of it to the poor and the helpless.
('62', 378, 5, 20, 750378) It is a social and religious obligation and has been called a sacrifice by the Bhagavad Gita.
('62', 378, 5, 21, 750472) He who does not offer this sacrifice has been called a thief.
('62', 378, 5, 22, 750534) 5 The Gita has enumerated many forms of sacrifice; but what greater sacrifice can there be than to serve the poor and the needy ?
('62', 378, 5, 23, 750664) For us today there can be no sacrifice higher than to forget the distinctions of high and low and to realize the equality of all men.
('62', 378, 5, 24, 750798) I also wish to bring home to the women of India that real ornamentation lies, not in loading the body with metal and stones, but in purifying the heart and developing the beauty of the soul.

('62', 379, 1, 3, 751554) The women who witnessed the scene were amazed at what was happening.
('62', 379, 1, 4, 751623) And then there was a shower of ornaments.
('62', 379, 1, 5, 751665) And do you think she looked less handsome because of her having given away the ornaments ?
('62', 379, 1, 6, 751756) Rather she looked to me more handsome.

('62', 379, 6, 19, 752459) January 4, 1934
('62', 379, 7, 20, 752475) Gandhiji thanked the citizens for the purse and hoped that every one of them, if they had not already done so, would get rid of untouchability from their hearts.
('62', 379, 7, 21, 752637) He read in their address that there were 800 Haijans living in Doddaballapur and that fifty per cent of the Harijan children were attending schools.
('62', 379, 7, 22, 752786) They were entitled to congratulations on this account.
('62', 379, 7, 23, 752841) But they could not possibly give themselves satisfaction by showing that so many Harijan children attended Harijan school.
('62', 379, 7, 24, 752964) It was absolutely necessary for them to teach Harijan boys and girls and for this it was

('62', 380, 1, 2, 753128) necessary for them to root out untouchability from their heart.
('62', 380, 1, 3, 753192) It was wrong to consider a single person as untouchable.
('62', 380, 1, 4, 753249) They should all forget that any single human being was lower than themselves.
('62', 380, 1, 5, 753327) In conclusion, Gandhiji hoped that God would give them all strength to blot out the curse of untouchablility.

('62', 380, 4, 9, 753512) Questions were put to Gandhiji about temple entry by Harijans.
('62', 380, 4, 10, 753575) Gandhiji said
('62', 380, 5, 11, 753589) that the opposition to temple entry was on the wane and that he found practically no
('62', 380, 6, 12, 753674) opposition through out his present tour to his work.
('62', 380, 6, 13, 753727) Asked what they should do if the majority were in faovur of temple entry and the State remained neutral, Gandhiji said : Let the majority and the minority fight it out.
('62', 380, 6, 14, 753896) The State will not interfere.
('62', 380, 6, 15, 753926) Only when the majority and the minority come to a clash, will the Government interfere and that too to maintain peace and tranquillity.
('62', 380, 6, 16, 754062) The majority cannot be obstructed by the minority.
('62', 380, 6, 17, 754113) To another question, Mahatma Gandhi replied that there was no such thing as utter majority.

('62', 380, 7, 20, 754341) I am not new to you, nor are you new to me.
('62', 380, 7, 21, 754385) But the mission that brings me here today is different from the mission that had brought me here years ago.
('62', 380, 7, 22, 754493) 2 Your address itself has made clear what I expect of you.
('62', 380, 7, 23, 754552) I thank you for the purse that has been presented to me on behalf of the Harijans this afternoon.
('62', 380, 7, 24, 754650) In your address you have recounted many of the virtues to which I might even be a stranger.
('62', 380, 7, 25, 754742) You have showered upon me compliments that may be wholly undeserved.
('62', 380, 7, 26, 754811) You have been good enough to admit that you are getting more and more convinced
('62', 380, 8, 27, 754891) 1 These included K. Ranga Iyengar, T. Subramanyam and Narayana Setty.
('62', 380, 8, 28, 754961) 2 Gandhiji had visited Mysore State in connection with Deshbandhu Memorial Fund collections and stayed at Nandi Hills from April 19 to the end of August 1927 to recoup his health; vide Vol. XXXIX.

('62', 381, 1, 2, 755200) that the eradication of untouchability from our society will not only purify Hinduism, but will transmute our national weakness into na tional strength and bring about greater solidarity among our people professing different religious faiths.
('62', 381, 1, 3, 755443) After that admission I had expected a recounting on your part of the many things that you might have done on behalf of the Harijans.
('62', 381, 1, 4, 755576) You express regret that, barring a few individual efforts, you have done little yet for the removal of untouchability.
('62', 381, 1, 5, 755695) Happily the best of our ability requires the purification of our own hearts.
('62', 381, 1, 6, 755772) If we really mean that on Gods earth there is no one low and no one high, we shall accomplish the mission that has brought me here today.
('62', 381, 1, 7, 755910) This belief in the distinction between the high and the low has eaten into the very vitals of Hinduism and what I have stated from a thousand platforms is but this simple truth that, if we do not now get rid of this canker, there is the impending danger of Hinduism itself perishing.
('62', 381, 1, 8, 756194) I therefore hope and pray that every one of those who are here present at this meeting will realize the truth of what I have said and will make the best possible effort to get rid of this curse of untouchability.
('62', 381, 2, 9, 756407) Proceeding, Mahatmaji expressed his regret at not being able to visit all parts of the town as he would have wished.
('62', 381, 2, 10, 756524) Owing to physical weakness, it was not possible for him to visit public institutions doing useful work.
('62', 381, 2, 11, 756628) He hoped that the people of Tumkur would take the will for the deed.

('62', 381, 5, 16, 756857) You have in the opening portion of your address expressed anxiety about my health on account of the constant travels.
('62', 381, 5, 17, 756975) Who would show anxiety, if not you the mothers of India, for your children ?
('62', 381, 5, 18, 757052) And I am one among the millions of your children.
('62', 381, 5, 19, 757102) But you should know that the way you can relieve my anxiety is by doing according to the message that I have come to tell you.
('62', 381, 5, 20, 757229) You can relieve my anxiety by paying handsomely for the mission that I am con ducting.

('62', 382, 1, 3, 757626) The silver and copper that you may give me is, truly speaking, according to our custom, not your property.
('62', 382, 1, 4, 757733) That belongs to your parents or to your husbands.
('62', 382, 1, 5, 757783) But what I want is something that you can definitely call your own and that can only be your jewellery.
('62', 382, 1, 6, 757887) But the giving up of your jewellery is the least of all the things that I want you to do.
('62', 382, 1, 7, 757977) It can only be a singing of your determination to carry out the message to its full extent.
('62', 382, 1, 8, 758069) And that message is that you should consider the Harijans as your own blood brothers and blood sisters and as your own children.
('62', 382, 1, 9, 758198) It is wrong and sinful to consider a single human being as an untouchable.
('62', 382, 1, 10, 758273) God has created all men and women alike.
('62', 382, 1, 11, 758314) Although our forms may be different and our dispositions may be different we are still, at the bottom, one.
('62', 382, 1, 12, 758422) Even as the leaves of one tree are one, whether they are small or big, so I want you to have no distinction of untouchable and touchable.
('62', 382, 1, 13, 758560) And that is what I call purification of the heart.

('62', 382, 3, 16, 758672) January 4, 1934
('62', 382, 4, 17, 758688) FRIENDS, I am deeply touched by your welcome.
('62', 382, 4, 18, 758734) I do not want all this enthusiasm of yours and all this exhibition of affection towards me to waste away without turning them to good use.
('62', 382, 4, 19, 758873) If you therefore have patience with me for a few brief moments, you will see that I turn all that enthusiasm and affection to good account.
('62', 382, 4, 20, 759013) What I am about to do will also be a test of the genuineness of your enthusiasm and your affection.
('62', 382, 4, 21, 759113) You know the message that I want to tell you.
('62', 382, 4, 22, 759159) I would like us all, every one of us, to purify our heart of the curse of untouchability.
('62', 382, 4, 23, 759249) In one of the many addresses that I had the honour and pleasure of receiving today after entering the border of Mysore State, it was truly stated that this curse of untouchability had permeated Hindu society to such an extent that it almost ruled our lives and the signatories to the address were good enough to say that the message I was trying to deliver to the Hindus of India was producing its effect and went on to admit that, if we could but get rid of this poison of untouchability, all our differences even between different communities would vanish.
('62', 383, 0, 1, 759808) 384 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('62', 383, 1, 2, 759850) There you see what I am asking every one of us to do.
('62', 383, 1, 3, 759904) I am pleading with you that we should get rid of this position of untouchability all along the line, so that we wont have only a particular class labeled as Harijans but we should all become Harijans, namely, and truly, children of God.
('62', 383, 1, 4, 760141) Today if we appeared before our Maker with this uncleanliness in our hearts, He will disown us because we have ourselves become disinherited.
('62', 383, 1, 5, 760283) And this little purse that you have given me, I regard as earnest of your determination that you will henceforth cease to regard any being on earth as lower than yourselves.
('62', 383, 1, 6, 760457) If among earthly parents there is no grade among their children, do you think that God has grades among His children, the God Whom we consider as the One and only Being, if He may be called a being, Who holds the scales of justice absolutely even ?
('62', 383, 1, 7, 760706) If you have actually understood the spirit of my message, you will understand when I say to you that those who give to the Harijan cause gain.
('62', 383, 1, 8, 760849) I go further and contend that you can never give to much too this cause.

('62', 383, 3, 11, 760970) During my frequent travels I have noticed that the reception committees are not too mindful of expense in catering for the wants of guests.
('62', 383, 3, 12, 761110) They will insist on producing sweets or other delicacies and a multiplicity of dishes.
('62', 383, 3, 13, 761197) I have firmly discountenanced these at all times, but this time when I am making collections for the Harijan cause, which I regard as a mission of penance and purification, I feel pained when there is any attempt at lavish hospitality.
('62', 383, 3, 14, 761433) In two places I observed that Gujarati cooks were brought in to produce Gujarati dishes.
('62', 383, 3, 15, 761522) I regard this as a wholly unnecessary procedure.
('62', 383, 3, 16, 761571) I believe that we should be able to accommodate ourselves to the food eaten in the provinces other than our own.
('62', 383, 3, 17, 761684) I know that this is not so simple a question as it appears.
('62', 383, 3, 18, 761744) I know southerners who have made a Herculean effort to take to Gujarati food and failed.
('62', 383, 3, 19, 761833) Gujaratis will not take to the southern mode of cooking.
('62', 383, 3, 20, 761890) Bengal produces dainties which the other provinces will not easily relish.
('62', 383, 3, 21, 761965) If we would be national instead of provincial, we would have to have an interchange of habits as to food, simplify our tastes and produce healthy dishes that all can take with impunity.
('62', 383, 3, 22, 762151) This means a careful study of the foods taken by different
('62', 383, 4, 23, 762210) 1 A Gujarati version of this appeared in Harijanbandhu, 31 12 1933
('62', 384, 0, 1, 762277) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 385
('62', 384, 1, 2, 762324) provinces, castes and denominations.
('62', 384, 1, 3, 762361) Unfortunately, or fortunately, there are not only different combinations in different provinces, but there are different styles in the same province, among the different communities.
('62', 384, 1, 4, 762544) It is necessary, therefore, for national workers to study the foods and the methods of perparing them in the various provinces and discover common, simple and cheap dishes which all can take without upsetting the digestive apparatus.
('62', 384, 1, 5, 762778) In any case it must be a matter of shame for workers not to know the manners and customs of different provinces and communities.
('62', 384, 1, 6, 762907) In liberal household cooks ought to be able to cook foods eaten in the various provinces.
('62', 384, 1, 7, 762997) Why should not a Gujarati be able to produce dishes which a Tamilian or an Andhra or a Bengali ordinarily eats ?
('62', 384, 1, 8, 763110) I know that we cannot meet at the top.
('62', 384, 1, 9, 763149) Nor is such a meeting necessary or desirable.
('62', 384, 1, 10, 763195) Rich people will have not only provincial combinations but specialities designed for their own households.
('62', 384, 1, 11, 763302) These cannot be universalized.
('62', 384, 1, 12, 763333) What can be and should be aimed at are common dishes for common people.
('62', 384, 1, 13, 763405) This I know is easily possible if we have the mind.
('62', 384, 1, 14, 763457) But to make this possible, volunteers will have to learn the art of cooking and for this purpose they will have also to study the values of different foods and evolve common dishes easily and cheaply prepared.
('62', 384, 1, 15, 763667) I have strayed somewhat from my main purpose which is to ask organizers of the tour in the provinces not to pamper us but to be rigorously simple and economical in catering for us.
('62', 384, 1, 16, 763848) We are or profess to be conducting a mission of self purification and represen ting the cause of the outcastes of Hindu humanity.
('62', 384, 1, 17, 763978) As such we have no right to the satisfaction of any but the barest wants and creature comforts.
('62', 384, 1, 18, 764074) Fried things and sweets must be strictly eschewed.
('62', 384, 1, 19, 764125) Ghee ought to be most sparingly used.
('62', 384, 1, 20, 764163) More than one green vegetable simply boiled would be regarded as unnecessary.
('62', 384, 1, 21, 764241) Expensive fruit should be always avoided.
('62', 384, 1, 22, 764283) I know that I am the culprit in the matter of fruit.
('62', 384, 1, 23, 764336) Friends would pamper me and go out of the way to procure the richest fruit for me.
('62', 384, 1, 24, 764419) I can only assure them that I do not need any other fruit than oranges, which experience has proved to be necessary for me.
('62', 384, 1, 25, 764543) In spite to all my vaunted abstinence,I know that of my party I am the costliest member to feed.
('62', 384, 1, 26, 764640) I am sorry that it should be so, but mother goat to whose milk I owe my bodily strength and sister orange who keeps me fresh cannot compete in cheapness with rice and wheat.
('62', 384, 1, 27, 764814) Let not my numerous hosts, however add to my indebtedness by importing tempting superfluities.
('62', 384, 1, 28, 764909) Let them not pander to my weak nesses, if they will help me to do my duty towards Harijans.

('62', 385, 7, 24, 766175) I also dont have much faith in it.

('62', 385, 7, 27, 766313) But if the doctor says you are, what is one to do ?
('62', 385, 7, 28, 766365) I have not been weighed recently.
('62', 385, 7, 29, 766399) But I keep good health.
('62', 385, 7, 30, 766423) I also eat well.

('62', 386, 5, 13, 767087) BHAI MAMA, I have your letter.
('62', 386, 5, 14, 767118) I have suggested not that the management of the institutions should be handed over to the Harijan Sevak Sangh but that the Harijan Sevak Sangh should provide their expenses.
('62', 386, 5, 15, 767292) From now on, therefore, it will be necessary to satisfy the Sangh.
('62', 386, 5, 16, 767359) When somebody provides us funds it is only fair that we satisfy them about the way we spend the funds and the way we run the institutions.
('62', 386, 5, 17, 767498) Sardar did not mean by the words used in his letter the other world.
('62', 386, 5, 18, 767567) He meant in jail or outside jail.
('62', 386, 5, 19, 767601) Is not that, too, the other world ?
('62', 386, 5, 20, 767637) We can call it the other world on the earth.
('62', 386, 5, 21, 767682) But you need not get alarmed or start worrying because of that.
('62', 386, 5, 22, 767746) For the present, you are expected to devote yourself exclusively to your [work] 2. Those who wish to go to the other world on the earth will certainly get their turn.
('62', 386, 5, 23, 767913) It is a matter of a few days only.

('62', 387, 8, 19, 769106) MY DEAR NAPOLEON, I have your letter.
('62', 387, 8, 20, 769144) Why do you say you do not know what to write?
('62', 387, 8, 21, 769190) Smart children like you can write a lot.
('62', 387, 8, 22, 769231) You can write about your studies, your friends, your experiences.
('62', 387, 8, 23, 769297) I hope Gangabas 2 going has not grieved you.
('62', 387, 8, 24, 769342) There was a girl called Lucy.
('62', 387, 8, 25, 769372) She had six brothers and sisters of whom some had died.
('62', 387, 8, 26, 769428) Still she used to say that they were seven.
('62', 387, 8, 27, 769472) 3 That implied great wisdom.
('62', 387, 8, 28, 769501) For, it is not through the body that somebody is a brother or a sister.

('62', 389, 1, 3, 771497) I would like you to be able to say the same thing about drink.
('62', 389, 1, 4, 771560) What is the use of paying for some coloured water which makes us so mad that we forget the distinction between mother, wife and sister ?
('62', 389, 1, 5, 771697) I have heard Harijans telling me that drink is prescribed for them on occasions of marriage and death.
('62', 389, 1, 6, 771800) I can tell you, without fear of contradiction, that is a suggestion of the devil.
('62', 389, 1, 7, 771882) It is nowhere written in scriptures.
('62', 389, 1, 8, 771919) I would ask you, brothers and sisters, not to go near the devil.
('62', 389, 1, 9, 771984) I hope you will take my advice to heart and it will give me great joy when you will be able to say that you have given up drink also.

('62', 389, 3, 12, 772175) January 5, 1934 It has given me much pleasure to renew acquaintance after six long years.
('62', 389, 3, 13, 772265) As you are aware, I came to Mysore State in order to regain my health that I had lost during the tour which I was conduc ting at that time.
('62', 389, 3, 14, 772405) And naturally I have the most pleasant recollections of my stay in Mysore.
('62', 389, 3, 15, 772480) From His Highness the Maharaja Saheb and his Dewan and other officials to the subjects of H.H. the Maharaja Saheb, I experienced nothing but the warmest affection.
('62', 389, 3, 16, 772644) You can, therefore, understand more fully probably than before how much joy it must have given me to have come in your midst again You have added to the joy and pleasure by asking me to perform the ceremony of unveiling a portrait of the late Sjt.
('62', 389, 3, 17, 772892) Venkatakrishnayya, the Grand Old Man of Mysore.
('62', 389, 3, 18, 772940) I congratulate the artist upon his effort, because it is a faithful representation of the figure which was quite famliar to me.
('62', 389, 3, 19, 773068) Perhaps, all of you do not know that I had the pleasure and privilege of seeing the Grand Old Man of Mysore in flesh and blood during my last visit.
('62', 389, 3, 20, 773217) I had then become acquainted with his many virtues.
('62', 389, 3, 21, 773269) I knew than that he occupied a unique place in your hearts.
('62', 389, 3, 22, 773329) I am quite sure you do not expect me or want me to recount his many virtures.
('62', 389, 3, 23, 773407) You who were on the spot knew them much better than I could possibly do during a brief visit.
('62', 389, 3, 24, 773501) I only hope that those of his virtues for which you and I prize his memory will be translated into our lives.
('62', 389, 3, 25, 773611) We may not flatter ourselves with the belief that we have discharged the obligation to his memory by your inviting me to unveil this

('62', 390, 1, 3, 773852) I must now pass on to the mission that has brought me here.
('62', 390, 1, 4, 773912) The Municipal address reminds me that I should see things which are worth seeing, so that I may carry away happy impressions of the effort that has been and is being made here on behalf of the Harijans.
('62', 390, 1, 5, 774115) The Reception Committee with very great forethought had arranged to take me, before bringing me to this meeting, to various cheries 1 and showed me the improvements made during these six years.
('62', 390, 1, 6, 774309) And you are quite right in thinking that after an examination of these places I should carry away nothing but happy impressions of what has been done on behalf of Harijans.
('62', 390, 1, 7, 774482) I must congratulate the State and the Municipality of Mysore on the neatness and cleanliness I observed in all the places visited this afternoon.
('62', 390, 1, 8, 774628) And I am glad for the assurance that the Municipality will not lose any time in looking after the domestic comforts of the Harijans of this city.
('62', 390, 1, 9, 774774) In my opinion, sweepers in every city are its noblest servants.
('62', 390, 1, 10, 774838) It must be a matter of humiliation and shame to have the sweepers and scavengers consigned to the dirtiest places and utterly neglected.
('62', 390, 1, 11, 774975) In my opinion, they hold the key of the health of every city in their pockets.
('62', 390, 1, 12, 775054) Any city that dares neglect its scavengers and sweepers commits the crime of neglecting the health of its citizens.
('62', 390, 1, 13, 775170) But my mission covers a much wider theme than the econo mic welfare of Harijans.
('62', 390, 1, 14, 775251) We are, no doubt, bound to jealously guard their economic and educational welfare.
('62', 390, 1, 15, 775334) But this is not enough, if we are do reparation to Harijans for the untold hardships to which we have subjected them for centuries past.
('62', 390, 1, 16, 775471) They are entitled to precisely the same rights and privileges as any other citizen.
('62', 390, 1, 17, 775555) And as Hindus they are entitled to the same social amenities and religious privileges that any other Hindu is entitled to.
('62', 390, 1, 18, 775678) My mission, therefore, is to invite savarna Hindus to wash themselves clean of the guilt of untouchability.
('62', 390, 1, 19, 775786) And if, during the short period of grace open to savarna Hindus, they fail to do this duty, I have not the shadow of a doubt that Hinduism will perish.
('62', 390, 1, 20, 775938) You can now understand that this cannot be done by a municipality or even the Maharaja Saheb himself.
('62', 390, 1, 21, 776040) If you and I will not change our hearts, what can even Rajas and Maharajas do ?
('62', 390, 1, 22, 776120) It is, therefore, my privilege, as it is my duty, to invite you to cleanse your hearts of untouchability, the distinction of high and low.
('62', 390, 1, 23, 776259) If you understand thoroughly the spirit of this message,

('62', 391, 1, 2, 776371) the change of heart is an incredibly simple performance; and you can see in the twinkling of an eye how, if this change comes about in savarna Hindu hearts, the economic, social and religious progress of Harijans must follow.
('62', 391, 1, 3, 776597) It will then be a sign and seal of this change of heart.
('62', 391, 1, 4, 776654) All these purses you have been kind enough to give me I consider as an earnest of your determination to make that change of heart.
('62', 391, 1, 5, 776785) May God give you the strength to do it and save Hinduism from impending doom.

('62', 391, 3, 8, 776912) [Before January 6, 1934]
('62', 391, 4, 9, 776937) You should know that our duty to Harijans does not end with giving them good houses or giving them separate wells, schools and so on.
('62', 391, 4, 10, 777071) If we gave them all these and still kept them untouchables, it would only mean replacing iron chains by golden ones; but the slave would still be a slave.
('62', 391, 4, 11, 777226) Harijans must have all the amenities that we enjoy.
('62', 391, 4, 12, 777278) But I go further and say, you must absorb them, you must bridge the gulf that lies today between them and you.
('62', 391, 4, 13, 777389) The purification we are striving for is not complete till we have purged our hearts of this distinction.
('62', 391, 4, 14, 777494) You and I may not be satisfied with anything less.
('62', 391, 5, 15, 777545) You, mothers, should wash your children every day, and so should you wash yourselves.
('62', 391, 5, 16, 777631) In the morning you should have what I call internal wash, that is to say, the first thing you should do on getting up is to take Ramanama and then pray to God that you should pass the day in sacredness, so that no wrong word may pass your lips and no wrong act may be done by you.
('62', 391, 5, 17, 777912) And then you should give yourselves an external wash.
('62', 391, 6, 18, 777966) At Anantapur 3, opening a water tap for them, he said : May this water be the water of life to you.
('62', 391, 6, 19, 778066) Water is an emblem of purity.
('62', 391, 6, 20, 778096) Just as we purify the body by bathing with water, so can we become pure in heart by a morning wash, i.e., by taking the name of God.
('62', 391, 6, 21, 778229) I am trying every moment of my life to be guided by ahimsa,

('62', 392, 1, 3, 778529) I am essentially a lover of peace.
('62', 392, 1, 4, 778564) I do not want to create dissensions.
('62', 392, 1, 5, 778601) And I assure those who oppose me that I shall not do a single thing which I know may be contrary to truth and love.
('62', 392, 2, 6, 778717) But we have created a hope in the hearts of Harijans.
('62', 392, 2, 7, 778771) They have begun to feel that they are going to be freed from this serfdom.
('62', 392, 2, 8, 778846) I expect of you that you will fulfil it.
('62', 392, 2, 9, 778887) It is said in all religions of the world that, if the poor are deceived, if the hopes given to them are not fulfilled, they heave a sigh of despair, a curse.
('62', 392, 2, 10, 779045) And I have no doubt that, if, after all that we have said and promised, we play false, the curse of these poor people is bound to descend on us and we shall perish.

('62', 392, 5, 14, 779285) BHAI PARIKSHITLAL, At the moment I cannot think of anything that I can do from here about the laws regarding Bhundi Bhunchhi 2. You have done the right thing in writing to the Dewan.
('62', 392, 5, 15, 779468) Please let me know if there has been any reply from him.
('62', 392, 5, 16, 779525) If I get an authoritative report on the subject from a newspaper correspondent in Kutch, I would publish it in Harijan.
('62', 392, 5, 17, 779645) Is the report that you have received authentic ?
('62', 392, 5, 18, 779694) Please inquire and let me know.
('62', 392, 5, 19, 779726) Try and get a copy of the legislation.
('62', 392, 5, 20, 779765) Most probably it was published in Navajivan.
('62', 392, 5, 21, 779810) The cheque which Chhagan lal Joshi has sent to you is an instalment of that sum of Rs. 5,700. I had made arrangements for it before I got your letter regar ding the use of a disinfectant.
('62', 392, 5, 22, 779998) Hence the cheque.
('62', 392, 5, 23, 780016) I will discuss the matter further when I meet Thakkar Bapa on the 16th.

('62', 393, 2, 4, 780612) He must have a character above reproach.
('62', 393, 2, 5, 780653) His eyes must be clean so that they may not offend.
('62', 393, 2, 6, 780705) His hands also must be clean and his touch must be pure and gentle.
('62', 393, 2, 7, 780773) His heart will not harbour a single impure thought.
('62', 393, 2, 8, 780825) His ears must be turned to listen to the music of the spheres, his feet will take him to the purest work, never to dens of evil and he will give his ear to all he hears but will spare his voice.
('62', 393, 3, 9, 781020) In the end Gandhiji exhorted them to join one of the greatest of reform movements in modern times.

('62', 393, 10, 20, 781570) January 7, 1934 My connection with the co operative movement is of a per functory character.
('62', 393, 10, 21, 781663) I tried to understand it as interpreted by Sir Daniel Hamilton I know what boon it can become to agriculturists.
('62', 393, 10, 22, 781776) I wish to tell you what I said long ago at a co operatives meeting at Bombay, when I had the honour of being invited by Lord Willingdon .
('62', 393, 10, 23, 781914) It is necessary for co operative societiesto trace the course of every pice lent.
('62', 393, 10, 24, 781996) Find out what the borrower is doing with his money.
('62', 393, 10, 25, 782048) This thought has never left me.
('62', 393, 11, 26, 782080) 1 An address was presented to Gandhiji at the Provincial Co operative Apex Bank Hall.

('62', 394, 1, 2, 782247) Gandhiji made a touching reference to the late Mr. K. H. Ramayya, Registrar of Co operative Societies.
('62', 394, 1, 3, 782350) He said that while he was in Bangalore six years ago, he used to meet the late Mr. Ramayya often and used to cut jokes with him.
('62', 394, 1, 4, 782479) It was only yesterday that he had learnt of the passing away of Mr. Ramayya.
('62', 394, 1, 5, 782556) Mahatma was really sorry for this.
('62', 394, 1, 6, 782591) The great work that he had done for the cause of Co operation in the State was too well known to need repetition by him.

('62', 394, 2, 8, 782767) 431. SPEECH AT CIVIC RECEPTION, BANGALORE
('62', 394, 3, 9, 782809) January 7, 1934 I am deeply grateful to the Bangalore City Municipality for presenting me with this address.
('62', 394, 3, 10, 782918) You have reminded me in your address that you were good enough to do me the honour of giving me such an address when I was in your midst last time.
('62', 394, 3, 11, 783066) And it flatters me to see that I still retain a corner of your hearts.
('62', 394, 3, 12, 783137) I tender you my congratulations upon all the things that you have done and are doing on behalf of the Harijans whose cause has brought me here.
('62', 394, 3, 13, 783281) I tender also my respectful congratulations to His Highness for the liberality with which his Government has been dealing with this problem.
('62', 394, 3, 14, 783422) You have admitted in your address that, while so much is being done by the Municipality for the Harijans, much more yet remains to be done.
('62', 394, 3, 15, 783562) It would be wrong on my part if I did not re echo that sentiment expressed in your address.
('62', 394, 3, 16, 783654) During the morning peregrinations, I had the painful duty of witnessing some of the habitations occupied by the Harijans.
('62', 394, 3, 17, 783776) It is difficult to call them even huts.
('62', 394, 3, 18, 783816) I had, therefore, not hesitated to describe them as holes.
('62', 394, 3, 19, 783875) These holes are no protection whatever to the Harijans against wind, rain and sun.
('62', 394, 3, 20, 783958) These dwellings are built of debris, which the Harijans could lay their hands upon.
('62', 394, 3, 21, 784042) You have every right to pride yourselves upon the beauty of Bangalore.
('62', 394, 3, 22, 784113) I am free to confess that Bombay cannot be described as Bombay, the beautiful.
('62', 394, 3, 23, 784192) There are such hideous and ugly spots in Bombay that it is a misnomer to call that city beautiful.
('62', 394, 3, 24, 784291) Comparative speaking, therefore, I have no hesitatio whatever in giving Bangalore the first prize for a beautiful city.
('62', 394, 3, 25, 784411) But I would like you not to be satisfied with the comparative merit.
('62', 394, 3, 26, 784480) I would like you to set before yourselves a minimum standard of comfort for the poorest of your citizens.
('62', 394, 4, 27, 784586) Proceeding, Mahatmaji thanked the citizens for the kind invitation extended to him to come over to Bangalore and stay for a short time after his all India tour.
('62', 395, 0, 1, 784747) 396 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('62', 395, 1, 2, 784789) I have experienced so much kindness and so much attention that I assure you that I need no temptation whatever to bring me here if only the call of duty enables me to take advantage of your hospitality and your climate.
('62', 395, 2, 3, 785009) Mahatma Gandhi next said that the touching reference in the address to the absence of his wife had moved him deeply.
('62', 395, 2, 4, 785126) They had taken the way that duty had shown them.
('62', 395, 2, 5, 785175) Her duty had taken her away to Yeravda and his duty had him in their midst.
('62', 395, 2, 6, 785251) He assured them that nothing would give them both greater pleasure than to enjoy their hospitality once more.
('62', 395, 2, 7, 785361) The Hindu, 8 1 1934
('62', 395, 3, 8, 785381) 432. SPEECH AT TEMPERANCE ASSOCIATION, BANGALORE January 7, 1934
('62', 395, 4, 9, 785446) It is a matter of pleasure to me that you have invited me to meet you and say a few words on the subject of temperance.
('62', 395, 4, 10, 785566) Some of you perhaps know that this is one of the matters that I took up before I was known to anybody and before I had conceived the thought of entering the political arena.
('62', 395, 4, 11, 785740) When as a young man I went to South Africa, I observed that the coolies, indentured Indians, were fast going down owing to the drink habit.
('62', 395, 4, 12, 785880) The law in South Africa made it a crime for indentured Indians to carry drink home.
('62', 395, 4, 13, 785964) They could drink as much as they liked at the canteen.
('62', 395, 4, 14, 786019) The result was that many women were found literally lying in gutters.
('62', 395, 4, 15, 786089) It was not a thing of which any Indian could be proud.
('62', 395, 4, 16, 786144) I pleaded with the Government, but mine was a voice in the wilderness.
('62', 395, 4, 17, 786215) So the thing went on.
('62', 395, 4, 18, 786237) But it made a lasting impression on my mind.
('62', 395, 4, 19, 786282) I knew what I had to do when I came to India after a long exile.
('62', 395, 4, 20, 786347) I am not a temperance man.
('62', 395, 4, 21, 786374) I am a prohibition man.
('62', 395, 4, 22, 786398) I fought with my countrymen in South Africa and said, We should not fight for an equal right to drink. I could not persuade them for a long time, but I did succeed in persuading a majority of them that to fight for rights was one thing and to fight for indulgence in vice was another.
('62', 395, 4, 23, 786683) If the whites were not punished by the State for drinking, we could not plead for the same exemption.
('62', 395, 4, 24, 786785) Here, in India, the Government are trading in liquor.
('62', 395, 4, 25, 786839) I know from bitter experience of Harijans that they drink in spite of themselves.
('62', 395, 4, 26, 786921) I have in mind an esteemed co worker in Calcutta, namely, Satis Chandra Das Gupta.
('62', 396, 0, 1, 787004) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 397
('62', 396, 1, 2, 787051) gave up a remunerative job.
('62', 396, 1, 3, 787079) He was and is still considered the right hand man of Dr. Roy.
('62', 396, 1, 4, 787141) He gave up his chemical work and today he lives near bastis.
('62', 396, 1, 5, 787202) He administered pledges to Harijans not to drink.
('62', 396, 1, 6, 787252) These they broke again and again.
('62', 396, 1, 7, 787286) That broke his heart and he fasted for 15 days.
('62', 396, 1, 8, 787334) It had a marvellous effect on the Harijans.
('62', 396, 1, 9, 787378) They said they would not now go back on their pledges.
('62', 396, 1, 10, 787433) Satis Babu had to go through that agony.
('62', 396, 1, 11, 787474) It was a joy for him.
('62', 396, 1, 12, 787496) A worker who fights drink tooth and nail has to go through this.
('62', 396, 1, 13, 787561) Many Harijans have said to me, Take away this temptation from us and we shall be all right.
('62', 396, 1, 14, 787653) Do not put it in our way. When we are not able to control ourselves in so many things, how much less can the Harijans and the labourers control themselves ?
('62', 396, 1, 15, 787810) I have lived, eaten and drunk with them.
('62', 396, 1, 16, 787851) They have no places of recreation.
('62', 396, 1, 17, 787886) They live in wretched holes.
('62', 396, 1, 18, 787915) They have no money to spend for creature comforts.
('62', 396, 1, 19, 787966) What little they get, therefore, goes to canteens.
('62', 396, 1, 20, 788017) I only give you the description to show you how keenly and bitterly I feel in connection with the drink evil.
('62', 396, 1, 21, 788127) I have not the shadow of a doubt that we shall not be able to combat this evil successfully till prohibition comes.
('62', 396, 1, 22, 788243) I have fixed views about prohibition.
('62', 396, 1, 23, 788281) I have given you the result of my experience that, without prohibition, it is impossible to bring about sober habits among the labouring population in India.
('62', 396, 1, 24, 788439) And I have observed that the Harijans are most addicted to this vice.
('62', 396, 1, 25, 788509) India is a country in which total prohibition can succeed.
('62', 396, 1, 26, 788568) People are not habitually given to drink.
('62', 396, 1, 27, 788610) It is not a fashionable vice.
('62', 396, 1, 28, 788640) The climate does not demand its use.
('62', 396, 1, 29, 788677) But government revenue is touched by prohibition.
('62', 396, 1, 30, 788727) Therefore they say, Find other sources of income before you ask us for total prohibition. I say, If you get revenue from impure sources and then say, Replace this revenue, you cannot be heard.
('62', 396, 1, 31, 788920) There should be no bargaining about it. Harijan, 19 1 1934

('62', 397, 2, 3, 789064) January 7, 1934 It gives me very great pleasure to see Mr. V. P. Madhava Rao 2 present here.
('62', 397, 2, 4, 789157) I had the pleasure of meeting him six years ago when I was in your midst.
('62', 397, 2, 5, 789231) That, in spite of his advanced age, he should have come here to give me his blessings must move the hardest heart.
('62', 397, 2, 6, 789346) I regard it as a blessing for the Harijan work I am doing and it is a matter of great joy and solace that such a great gathering of learned men of Mysore who have seen so much life should be here to bless his movement.
('62', 397, 2, 7, 789565) But, I miss the presence, at this meeting, of Mr. Humza Hussain, who was the Chairman of the Reception Committee when I came here six years ago.
('62', 397, 2, 8, 789710) I have a vivid recollection of his many kindnesses and how I wish he had been here at this meeting to greet me as on old friend.
('62', 397, 2, 9, 789839) May God give his soul peace.
('62', 397, 2, 10, 789868) I am very grateful to you for the purse that you have presented me.
('62', 397, 2, 11, 789936) I was almost going to say a good purse, but I have hesitated to use this adjective, because I know that the citizens of Bangalore are quite able to put together a larger purse and I know that by the time I say goodbye to you, I shall have many generous contributions to the cause of Harijans.
('62', 397, 2, 12, 790229) After all, it is the least reparation that we can do to these brothers and sisters whom Hindus have systematically suppressed.
('62', 397, 2, 13, 790356) I have read your address from top to bottom.
('62', 397, 2, 14, 790401) And I congra tulate you and the Maharaja Sahebs Government on the many things that you have been able to recite in that address.
('62', 397, 2, 15, 790530) But, neither the State nor the people of Mysore nor I can find any cause for satisfaction unless untouchability is entirely rooted out from our hearts.
('62', 397, 2, 16, 790682) While I gratefully acknowledge all that you have done for Harijans, I ask you not to rest content till all Harijans enjoy all the rights that savarna Hindus enjoy in all walks of life.
('62', 397, 2, 17, 790867) Let us undergo this necessary purification, while there is this brief moment of probation still left to us by God.
('62', 397, 2, 18, 790982) Be sure, if you fail in this hour, Gods wrath will swiftly descend on the Hindus.
('62', 397, 2, 19, 791064) But, one word to Harijan brothers and sisters.
('62', 397, 2, 20, 791111) You cannot be free from this self purification.
('62', 397, 2, 21, 791159) You too have to make your sacrifices at the common altar.
('62', 397, 2, 22, 791217) And that consists in the strict observance of

('62', 398, 1, 2, 791494) sanitation, internal and external.
('62', 398, 1, 3, 791529) Secondly, in giving up carrion and beef eating wherever that habit still persists.
('62', 398, 1, 4, 791612) In every part of the civilized world, carrion is abhorred with detestation.
('62', 398, 1, 5, 791688) It is considered unfit for human consumption.
('62', 398, 1, 6, 791734) And no one can call himself a Hindu and partake of beef.
('62', 398, 1, 7, 791791) The sacredness of the cow and her worship is an integral part of Hinduism.
('62', 398, 1, 8, 791866) Thirdly, I would ask every Harijan man and woman present here to give up the habit of drink.
('62', 398, 1, 9, 791959) Let no Harijan say that savarna Hindus also drink.
('62', 398, 1, 10, 792010) It is no answer.
('62', 398, 1, 11, 792027) I would beseech you, as a fellow Harijan by calling, to shun all the vices of savarna Hindus.
('62', 398, 1, 12, 792121) In spite of all the reparations that savarna Hindus make to you, in the presence of God after all, in the ultimate end, your salvation rests in your own hands.
('62', 398, 1, 13, 792281) It was therefore a matter of great joy when day before yesterday 1 Harijans gave me their assurance that they had given up beef eating and would try to give up drink.
('62', 398, 1, 14, 792448) Let us all pray to God that He may give strength to the Harijans to carry out their resolve to leave off drink.

('62', 398, 3, 17, 792613) BANGALORE, January 7, 1934 It is for you to supplement the work done by the State.
('62', 398, 3, 18, 792696) 3 You may find workers to go and live in the midst of Harijans.
('62', 398, 3, 19, 792760) This is merely all illustration.
('62', 398, 3, 20, 792793) The rule is, you begin where the State ends.
('62', 398, 3, 21, 792838) The State cannot attend to individuals.
('62', 398, 3, 22, 792878) That is the prerogative of private persons.
('62', 398, 3, 23, 792922) Each worker should measure his own capacity.
('62', 398, 3, 24, 792967) We must not do anything for spectacular effect.
('62', 398, 3, 25, 793015) Our work may not be pretentious, but it must be solid.
('62', 398, 3, 26, 793070) We have to come in intimate touch with the peoplesavarnas as well as Harijans.
('62', 398, 3, 27, 793149) Such contact with the people can never be established by the State.
('62', 398, 3, 28, 793217) That is essentially the work of the Social reformer.
('62', 398, 3, 29, 793270) Temple entry work is to be done by workers specially qualified for that work.
('62', 398, 3, 30, 793348) If they show character, it will move the Harijan mass.
('62', 398, 3, 31, 793403) The workers must not go in the midst of Harijans as strangers or patrons but go as friends and servants.
('62', 398, 3, 32, 793508) Such work is being done in Wardha.
('62', 398, 3, 33, 793543) If there is one true worker, he will mutiply himself.

('62', 399, 8, 10, 794217) I had news of Pragji for the first time from you.
('62', 399, 8, 11, 794267) Do you have any friends in Dharwar ?
('62', 399, 8, 12, 794304) Let me know whenever you get a letter from there.

('62', 399, 8, 14, 794385) Keep me informed about yourself and the children.
('62', 399, 8, 15, 794435) Address your letters to Wardha.
('62', 399, 8, 16, 794467) Did you write the letter yourself or did you get it written by somebody else ?

('62', 399, 12, 20, 794670) BA, I have still not received your letter, but I believe it will reach me after some wandering.
('62', 399, 12, 21, 794766) I hope you are getting the newspaper now.
('62', 399, 12, 22, 794808) You must have received the Bhagavat and the Ramayana.
('62', 399, 12, 23, 794862) Write for anything else you may wish to have.
('62', 399, 12, 24, 794908) I had a letter from Manilal, as also one from Sushila.
('62', 399, 12, 25, 794963) They are both well.
('62', 399, 12, 26, 794983) Manilal is unperturbed and asks you not to worry about him.
('62', 399, 12, 27, 795043) Sita is growing up fast.
('62', 399, 12, 28, 795068) She is always playing about.
('62', 399, 12, 29, 795097) Devdas has been released earlier than expected.
('62', 399, 12, 30, 795145) He has gone to Ahmedabad.
('62', 399, 12, 31, 795171) I had a wire from him.
('62', 399, 12, 32, 795194) Perhaps he will visit you.

('62', 400, 1, 2, 795291) There were letters from Ramdas and Nimu too.
('62', 400, 1, 3, 795336) I keep on writing to Manu, but again there has been no letter from her.
('62', 400, 1, 4, 795408) Kishorelals fever has come down a little and so it can be hoped that he will have fully recovered in a few days.
('62', 400, 1, 5, 795521) There is nothing but good news about Mani.
('62', 400, 1, 6, 795564) Om, Kisan, Chandrashankar, etc., are all well.
('62', 400, 1, 7, 795611) I am in Bangalore today.
('62', 400, 1, 8, 795636) Everyone has been inquiring after you.
('62', 400, 1, 9, 795675) Shankerlal and Gulzarilal have come here.
('62', 400, 1, 10, 795717) There is to be a meeting of the Panch regarding the workers wages.
('62', 400, 1, 11, 795784) Tomorrow is Tuesday, and so it will meet tomorrow.
('62', 400, 1, 12, 795835) Afterwards I have to go to Malabar.
('62', 400, 1, 13, 795871) I will be going to the area which you once visited.
('62', 400, 1, 14, 795923) Urmila Devis 1 son has a job in Madras now.
('62', 400, 1, 15, 795967) I keep good health.
('62', 400, 1, 16, 795987) There is no cause at all for worry.
('62', 400, 1, 17, 796023) At every place people come in large crowds and give me purses, jewellery, etc.
('62', 400, 1, 18, 796102) Kanti is better now.
('62', 400, 1, 19, 796123) I see that Bal will be seeing me in a few days.
('62', 400, 1, 20, 796171) His health also is quite good.
('62', 400, 1, 21, 796202) I hope all of you there are well.
('62', 400, 1, 22, 796236) What progress have Shanta and Lalita made in their studies ?
('62', 400, 1, 23, 796297) And now the discourse.
('62', 400, 1, 24, 796320) Today I will write something about what the Gita says concerning yajna.
('62', 400, 1, 25, 796392) The subject is introduced in Chapter III.
('62', 400, 1, 26, 796434) In that chapter the Lord says that he who eats without performing yajna eats stolen food 2. This is a very serious statement indeed, for eating stolen food is like swallowing raw mercury.
('62', 400, 1, 27, 796622) Nobody can digest it and, if anyone eats it, he will get eruptions all over the body.
('62', 400, 1, 28, 796708) Hence Akho Bhagat has said : Eating stolen food is like swallowing raw mercury. If, therefore, a person stops performing yajna even for a while, he becomes a thief.
('62', 400, 1, 29, 796873) All of us should know that this yajna means.
('62', 400, 1, 30, 796918) Fortunately for us, it is easy for all whose heart is in the right place.
('62', 400, 1, 31, 796992) It requires no wealth, no intellect nor education.
('62', 400, 1, 32, 797043) Yajna means any act of service.
('62', 400, 1, 33, 797075) Only about a person whose whole life is a ceaseless yajna can it be said that he does not eat stolen food.
('62', 400, 1, 34, 797182) Hence those who do just a little work as yajna may be said to be not guilty of theft to that extent.
('62', 400, 1, 35, 797283) Looking at the matter from this point of view, we see that all of us are guilty of theft more or less.
('62', 400, 1, 36, 797386) Our yajna can be said to be perfect only when we have shed all selfishness.
('62', 400, 1, 37, 797462) To do this means to give up the sense of I and mine, to cease feeling that this belongs to me and that to somebody else, that this is my son and that somebody elses.
('62', 400, 1, 38, 797628) There should not be even a trace of such a feeling in ones heart.
('62', 400, 1, 39, 797694) He alone can do this who offers up his all to Shri Krishna.
('62', 400, 1, 40, 797754) He who has done that does everything with God as witness, as

('62', 401, 1, 4, 797978) Happiness and sufferring are the same to him.
('62', 401, 1, 5, 798024) He uses his body, mind, intellect, possessionsall that is hisfor the service of others.
('62', 401, 1, 6, 798112) All of us cannot do such perfect yajna.
('62', 401, 1, 7, 798152) If, however, we have the aspiration in our heart to serve the whole world, what work is there which most people can do and which would include service to the whole world ?
('62', 401, 1, 8, 798324) Asking this question, we found that the answer was spinning, which is the work that countless people can do in the spirit of service.
('62', 401, 1, 9, 798458) One who spins will have done that much labour for the service of the world.
('62', 401, 1, 10, 798534) But I mention this only as an example.
('62', 401, 1, 11, 798573) What I wished to explain was the meaning and importance of yajna.
('62', 401, 1, 12, 798639) I shall be satisfied if I have been able to explain it.

('62', 401, 7, 24, 799192) The mill owners will arrive tomorrow.
('62', 401, 7, 25, 799230) I have told them that I would be able to give five hours for the meeting.
('62', 401, 7, 26, 799304) We are leaving for Malabar tomorrow night.
('62', 401, 7, 27, 799347) The pressure of work remains heavy.
('62', 401, 7, 28, 799383) But I keep good health.
('62', 401, 7, 29, 799407) Subba Rao 1 came and examined me yesterday.
('62', 401, 7, 30, 799451) He was pleased.
('62', 401, 7, 31, 799467) The blood pressure was 155 100. This is excellent.

('62', 402, 1, 3, 799948) 1He wanted my permission to sell off his car.
('62', 402, 1, 4, 799994) Soon after, I got a wire from Thakkar Bapa, informing me that he was really willing to sell it.
('62', 402, 1, 5, 800090) I, therefore, gave my consent, although I didnt understand the position at all.
('62', 402, 1, 6, 800170) In such matters I depend entirely on you.
('62', 402, 1, 7, 800212) I, therefore, often follow the example of Ekalavya.
('62', 402, 1, 8, 800264) He made a clay image of Dronacharya and learnt archery by practising before it so that he could become Arjunas equal.
('62', 402, 1, 9, 800382) I form a mental image of you and consult it.
('62', 402, 1, 10, 800427) Assuming that you would advise me to give my consent in this matter, I sent a wire saying yes.

('62', 402, 1, 12, 800593) I see this from his loving reply to my letter of condolence.

('62', 402, 1, 14, 800683) I see from .
('62', 402, 1, 15, 800696) s 3 letter that he is not happy.
('62', 402, 1, 16, 800729) I have asked him what the reason is.
('62', 402, 1, 17, 800766) Munshi has resumed practice.
('62', 402, 1, 18, 800795) You must have read about Jivraj.
('62', 402, 1, 19, 800828) Dr. Bidhan may be said to have returned from the jaws of death.
('62', 402, 1, 20, 800892) He tells me so in reply to a wire which I had sent to him.
('62', 402, 1, 21, 800951) A bone is fractured.
('62', 402, 1, 22, 800972) He will have to be in bed for some 15 days at least.
('62', 402, 1, 23, 801025) I had a letter from Mama in which he has referred to a letter of yours.
('62', 402, 1, 24, 801097) He says that it is not practicable now to collect separate contributions and keep separate accounts for the Harijan work, nor will the people give such contributions.
('62', 402, 1, 25, 801264) Hence, for Navasari, Godhra and other centres for which separate funds and accounts were being maintained, budgets within our means have been passed and it has been decided to obtain the money from the funds of the Harijan Sevak Sangh.
('62', 402, 1, 26, 801500) The control of the institutions concerned will not be changed.
('62', 402, 1, 27, 801563) The only change will be that they will receive reasonable grants and will run under the supervision of the Harijan Sevak Sangh.
('62', 402, 1, 28, 801691) Their independent existence will in no way be endangered.
('62', 402, 1, 29, 801749) Mama has volunteered to devote himself wholly to this work for the present.
('62', 402, 1, 30, 801825) I plainly refuse to guide anbody.
('62', 402, 1, 31, 801859) I dont feel inclined in my heart to do so.
('62', 402, 1, 32, 801902) If you have any questions to ask or wish to know more about the Harijan Sevak Sangh, you can write to me.
('62', 402, 1, 33, 802008) I dont know what I should tell you.
('62', 402, 1, 34, 802044) If, however, you give me the slightest indication as to what you want, I will give, that is, send all the required information.
('62', 402, 1, 35, 802172) You need have no fear that I myself will write out the reply.
('62', 402, 1, 36, 802234) I spare my hand and brain unnecessary exertion and economize time in

('62', 403, 1, 3, 802455) Devdas has been released before his time.
('62', 403, 1, 4, 802497) There was a wire from him.
('62', 403, 1, 5, 802524) He will of course come and see me.
('62', 403, 1, 6, 802559) The wire was sent from Ahmedabad.
('62', 403, 1, 7, 802593) Most probably he will pay a visit to Ba.
('62', 403, 1, 8, 802634) Manilal and Sushila write to me.
('62', 403, 1, 9, 802667) His affairs are all right.
('62', 403, 1, 10, 802694) Keshu also has got a good job.
('62', 403, 1, 11, 802725) Ramdas is very much upset.
('62', 403, 1, 12, 802752) He can enjoy no peace of mind at all.
('62', 403, 1, 13, 802790) It seems that Kishorelal is steadily improving.
('62', 403, 1, 14, 802838) Brijkrishna has survived.
('62', 403, 1, 15, 802864) He can walk a little now.
('62', 403, 1, 16, 802890) Jamnalal has a cold and so on.
('62', 403, 1, 17, 802921) Shankerlal thinks that his health is certainly not too good.
('62', 403, 1, 18, 802982) But his weight has increased and he has now reached about 200 lb.

('62', 403, 7, 26, 803246) SHANTIKUMAR, I am often hoping for a letter from you and when I dont get any I take it that you have refrained from writing out of consideration for me.
('62', 403, 7, 27, 803399) I hope the operation 1 went off well.
('62', 403, 7, 28, 803437) Please write or get someone to write to me sometimes.
('62', 403, 7, 29, 803491) Normally, I am told, it is a simple operation.
('62', 403, 7, 30, 803538) I suppose you do read Harijan.

('62', 404, 2, 3, 803886) January 8, 1934
('62', 404, 3, 4, 803902) BHAISHRI MUNSHI, I have your letter.
('62', 404, 3, 5, 803939) I have not received Lilavatis so far.
('62', 404, 3, 6, 803977) I will send you the literature on the Bills regarding untouchability.
('62', 404, 3, 7, 804047) If I cannot get a whole loaf of bread I shall be willing to accept even a quarter.
('62', 404, 3, 8, 804130) It is only when I am offered instead of bread a stone purporting to be bread that I refuse to accept it.
('62', 404, 3, 9, 804235) But I have no fear that you will ever give me a stone instead of bread.
('62', 404, 3, 10, 804307) Please, therefore, continue to give me whatever you can.
('62', 404, 3, 11, 804364) I see no harm if a party like the one you suggest comes into existence.
('62', 404, 3, 12, 804436) Please go through the changes that I have made in your draft.
('62', 404, 3, 13, 804498) 1 The reference to civil disobedience is not proper.
('62', 404, 3, 14, 804551) An element of corruption had certainly crept into it.
('62', 404, 3, 15, 804605) But even a reference to that is completely out of place in this draft.
('62', 404, 3, 16, 804676) Our opponents are bound to take advantage of it.
('62', 404, 3, 17, 804725) We might even take that risk if such reference were relevant.
('62', 404, 3, 18, 804787) Nor was corruption the cause of my suspending that part of civil disobedience which I have done.
('62', 404, 3, 19, 804884) This party is not being formed in order to attract other parties to it.
('62', 404, 3, 20, 804956) The reason for forming it is that those Cogressmen who do not or cannot take part in the civil disobedience movement desire to ensure their continued [political] existence and to do some service.
('62', 404, 3, 21, 805152) I, therefore, consider any reference to other parties as unnecessary.
('62', 404, 3, 22, 805222) After the party is formed, it may start negotiations with other parties for any purpose.
('62', 404, 3, 23, 805311) What its name will be will have to be thought over.
('62', 404, 3, 24, 805363) Just as you thought it proper to consult me, I would advise you to consult Jawaharlal too.
('62', 404, 3, 25, 805454) If you endanger your health by running about too much, you are going to hear from me.

('62', 405, 2, 3, 805871) BANGALORE, January 8, 1934
('62', 405, 3, 4, 805898) RAMDAS, I got both your letters.
('62', 405, 3, 5, 805931) Do not worry about your having opened Manilals letter.
('62', 405, 3, 6, 805986) You are free to open any letter.
('62', 405, 3, 7, 806019) How can I possibly keep anything secret from you all.
('62', 405, 3, 8, 806073) You fear your own shadow, fancying a whole lot of misfortunes.
('62', 405, 3, 9, 806136) Both of you have resolved to stay on there and have the necessary experience.
('62', 405, 3, 10, 806214) You should therefore stick to the place now.
('62', 405, 3, 11, 806259) Go on cheerfully doing what you can and be happy.
('62', 405, 3, 12, 806309) If you do that, you will certainly get over your diffidence.
('62', 405, 3, 13, 806370) I may say I have now begun to understand why you suffer.
('62', 405, 3, 14, 806427) Without knowing it, you are trying to appear better than you are, wish to do so, but you should check such a wish.
('62', 405, 3, 15, 806542) One should not feel miserable at what one is.
('62', 405, 3, 16, 806588) One should try to improve oneself but should not worry ifone fails.
('62', 405, 3, 17, 806656) That is the essence of the Bhagavad Gitas teaching and therein lies true.
('62', 405, 3, 18, 806730) Humility you have in ample measure but you feel sore in your mind fancying that you lack something.
('62', 405, 3, 19, 806830) To do so is the very opposite of humility.
('62', 405, 3, 20, 806873) Humility always makes one contented with what one is.
('62', 405, 3, 21, 806927) Why should you, seeing someones palace, pull down your little hut?
('62', 405, 3, 22, 806994) Why should you not think of your hut as much better than a palace?
('62', 405, 3, 23, 807061) It is not true that those who live in palaces are happier than those who live in huts.
('62', 405, 3, 24, 807148) Happiness consists in being contented.
('62', 405, 3, 25, 807187) Why need you feel sore over your inability to overcome your impure thoughts?
('62', 405, 3, 26, 807264) Everyone in this humility world is full of blemishes.
('62', 405, 3, 27, 807318) Out of countless persons who try to overcome their impure thoughts, only one succeeds in doing so.
('62', 405, 3, 28, 807417) The vast majority should be satisfied with doing the best they can and leave the result to God.
('62', 405, 3, 29, 807513) You need not feel the least constraint in writing anything to me.
('62', 405, 3, 30, 807579) You should make it a rule to write to me at least once a week.
('62', 405, 3, 31, 807642) You will feel light in your heart if you do so.
('62', 405, 3, 32, 807690) Never entertain such futile thoughts that you could not write to me because you were unworthy.
('62', 405, 3, 33, 807785) Should you on your own think yourself unworthy, or feel so only if I thought you unworthy?
('62', 405, 3, 34, 807876) Will you try to curb my thoughts?
('62', 405, 3, 35, 807910) If God thinks me worthy, why should I think myself to be unworthy?
('62', 405, 3, 36, 807977) God never regards anyone as unworthy.
('62', 405, 3, 37, 808015) How, then, could parents with feet of clay think their offspring unworthy?
('62', 405, 3, 38, 808090) Are they themselves likely to be so perfect that they can claim the right to judge their offspring and
('62', 406, 0, 1, 808193) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 407
('62', 406, 1, 2, 808240) think them unworthy?
('62', 406, 1, 3, 808261) No one is competent to judge who in this world is worthy and who is not.
('62', 406, 1, 4, 808334) All of us being imperfect, we should bear with one another and do the best we can and purify ourselves.
('62', 406, 1, 5, 808438) Parents have no right to sit in judgment over their offspring, nor has a husband the right to sit in judgment over his wife.
('62', 406, 1, 6, 808563) This is implicit in ahimsa.
('62', 406, 1, 7, 808591) Therefore overcome your sense of frustration and take heart.

('62', 406, 7, 16, 809088) January 10, 1934 Early in the morning, I entered Malabarwith due deference to our friends who call themselves sanataniststhe land of inequalities.
('62', 406, 7, 17, 809235) As I was passing by familiar places the face of a solitary Nayadi, whom I had seen during the previous visit, rose before my eyes.
('62', 406, 7, 18, 809366) 2 It was about ten or eleven in the morning when, in the midst of a discussion about untouchability, unapproachability and invisibility, all forms of which are found in no part of the world except in Malabar, a shrill voice was heard.
('62', 406, 7, 19, 809601) Those who were talking to me said, We can show you a live Nayadi. The public road was not for him.
('62', 406, 7, 20, 809700) Unshod, he was walking across the fields with a noiseless tread.
('62', 406, 7, 21, 809765) I went out with the friends and saw the Nayadi.
('62', 406, 7, 22, 809813) I asked him to come and talk to me.
('62', 406, 7, 23, 809849) Evidently he was frightened and he did not know when a blow would descend upon him.
('62', 406, 7, 24, 809933) Trembling he talked to me.
('62', 406, 7, 25, 809960) I told him that the public road was a much for him as for me.
('62', 406, 7, 26, 810022) He said, It cannot be so.
('62', 406, 8, 27, 810048) 1 The meeting, held at 8.15 in the morning, was attended by about 4,000 persons.
('62', 406, 8, 28, 810129) Addresses of welcome were presented to Gandhiji by the Municipality and the Taluk Board.

('62', 407, 1, 2, 810313) may not walk on the public road.
('62', 407, 1, 3, 810346) I close that scene and ask the sanatanists or anybody else to show me the authority in defence of this inhuman conduct.
('62', 407, 1, 4, 810466) You will find me smiling with you, laughing with you, and cracking jokes with you, but you may also know that behind all those jokes and smiles and laughs, the face of the Nayadi and that scene will keep haunting me throughout my tour in Malabar.
('62', 407, 1, 5, 810713) As I was coming here, I was greeted by black flag demonstrators mixed with national flag demonstrators.
('62', 407, 1, 6, 810817) I tell you that I appreciated the black flag demonstrators more than the national flag demons trators because I could see untruth in its nakedness behind the black flag.
('62', 407, 1, 7, 810987) What if those who had black flags had smeared themselves as Brahmins do ?
('62', 407, 1, 8, 811061) He is no Brahmin merely because he carries a black flag or red flag and has marks on his forehead.
('62', 407, 1, 9, 811160) Brahminhood is not known by external marks.
('62', 407, 1, 10, 811204) The scriptures I swear by and in whose defence I would love to die tell me that he alone is a Brahmin who knows Brahman.
('62', 407, 1, 11, 811325) Brahminhood is the essence of humanity, self effacement, pity.
('62', 407, 1, 12, 811388) All those virtues which our ancestors have taught us to prize have to incarnate themselves in a Brahmin.
('62', 407, 1, 13, 811493) He is a Brahmin who is a living treasure of scriptures, but not he who makes a demonstration of untruth by carrying a black flag.
('62', 407, 1, 14, 811623) I have come to Malabar to speak out of the very depths of my soul.
('62', 407, 1, 15, 811690) There are many things in Malabar over which, as you know, I have gone into raptures.
('62', 407, 1, 16, 811775) You have scenery which is second to none in the world.
('62', 407, 1, 17, 811830) Man, if he behaves himself, can live an easy life in Malabar.
('62', 407, 1, 18, 811892) Woman in Malabar is the freest in India.
('62', 407, 1, 19, 811933) All the women I have seen in Malabar have a majesty which has always commanded my respect.
('62', 407, 1, 20, 812024) As you know, I had the pleasure of meeting the ex Maharani of Travancore.
('62', 407, 1, 21, 812098) Her simplicity commanded my admiration and at first sight I fell in love with her.
('62', 407, 1, 22, 812181) But there is nothing to be proud of in the Malabar untouchability.
('62', 407, 1, 23, 812248) It is the vilest thing on earth.
('62', 407, 1, 24, 812281) I want you to wipe out this shame of untouchability from Malabar; and if you can do it, the whole of India naturally will follow; and you can do it if you will.
('62', 407, 1, 25, 812442) I have entered Malabar in high hopes.
('62', 407, 1, 26, 812480) It is for you to fulfil it or frustrate it.
('62', 407, 1, 27, 812524) Only write down this prophecy in your hearts that, if untouchability as we practise it today lives, Hinduism perishes.
('62', 407, 1, 28, 812643) I ask you to believe in what I am saying and to save Hinduism from impending doom.
('62', 407, 1, 29, 812726) You have the opportunity of making your choice.
('62', 407, 1, 30, 812774) Make it now or never.

('62', 408, 2, 4, 812955) I have come here to ask you to do penance.
('62', 408, 2, 5, 812998) I have come here to ask you to forget that there can be a single human being who can be called untouchable.
('62', 408, 2, 6, 813106) You, the women of Malabar, are freer than any women in any other part of India.
('62', 408, 2, 7, 813186) And if you choose to, you can save Hinduism from peril.
('62', 408, 2, 8, 813242) Even if millions of people came and said that untouchability was a divine institution, I will repeat it is an institution of the devil.
('62', 408, 2, 9, 813378) I have just now come from a little settlement where I saw Nayadi brethren and some sisters.
('62', 408, 2, 10, 813470) It is your shame and my shame that they have got to live on a little rice thrown at them from a distance.
('62', 408, 2, 11, 813576) I have nothing more to say to you.
('62', 408, 2, 12, 813611) And if you want to commence by doing penance, then you will commence by discarding your ornaments and silver to contribute funds to help these helpless human beings.

('62', 408, 4, 15, 813846) January 10, 1934 Well, I have received this address, which I suppose you have not read.
('62', 408, 4, 16, 813934) Therefore whatever is written in the address will have very little value and this I regard as a breach of truth.
('62', 408, 4, 17, 814047) As a matter of fact, if you would have read this address to me in Malayalam, then I might have known that you represented your own feelings and it would have some educative value.
('62', 408, 4, 18, 814227) Also, your lot was not unknown to me.
('62', 408, 4, 19, 814265) I have just now come to Malabar, as I am touring in other parts of India for one purpose only, namely, to abolish distinction between Nayadis and non Nayadis.
('62', 408, 4, 20, 814424) There is no sin as great as unapproachability or untouchability.
('62', 408, 4, 21, 814489) So long as Harijans are crushed by that devil called untouchability, we have to work to crush that devil.
('62', 408, 4, 22, 814595) I want that untouchability must be wiped out of Hinduism, or Hinduism would perish.
('62', 408, 4, 23, 814679) I would like you to take part in the movement for purification in the best manner possible, taking advantage of every other facility that might be offered, in the way of education, to your children and yourself.

('62', 409, 3, 6, 815295) January 10, 1934
('62', 409, 4, 7, 815312) FRIENDS, I thank you for the address presented to me and the purse.
('62', 409, 4, 8, 815380) This is the first place in Malabar where an address has been presented by women.
('62', 409, 4, 9, 815461) By that if you mean that you represent the women of the taluk, then it means that men have no addresses to present to me.
('62', 409, 4, 10, 815583) It may be that you are not touched by the spirit of self purification.
('62', 409, 4, 11, 815654) I see that the women of Malabar have not summoned sufficient strength to present an address both on behalf of men and women.
('62', 409, 4, 12, 815779) The women must lead the battle against untouchability.
('62', 409, 4, 13, 815834) In point of education, Malabar women are much more advanced than their sisters in other presidencies.
('62', 409, 4, 14, 815936) I want you to turn this to the best possible advantage.
('62', 409, 4, 15, 815992) When I put to auction articles presented to me I hope that women would put to shame men by taking them for higher prices.
('62', 409, 4, 16, 816114) I can point out that you can commence this today by offering one bangle, necklace, etc.
('62', 409, 4, 17, 816202) But you are smiling or laughing.
('62', 409, 4, 18, 816235) I take it seriously.
('62', 409, 4, 19, 816256) Women in less advanced parts of India like Madras and Andhra commenced to bid by offering two or three bangles.
('62', 409, 4, 20, 816368) I shall be presently putting the womens spirit to rest as soon as I finish a few remarks.
('62', 409, 4, 21, 816458) I want to tell the sisters who have gathered here that after I entered into Malabar this morning I have been considering what special message I can deliver, because Malabar shows this disease of untouchability in a most aggravated form.
('62', 409, 4, 22, 816695) I feel that if the women of Malabar determine to work for this cause with redoubled energy, this devil can be wiped out.
('62', 409, 4, 23, 816816) In others parts of the world, women won their rights by making sacrifices and suffering.
('62', 409, 4, 24, 816905) But for Malabar women it should be a double speciality, and that for the simple reason that the women of Malabar occupy in India a most unique position.
('62', 409, 4, 25, 817058) Therefore, if the women of Malabar led a battle against the devil of untouchability, it would be wiped out soon.
('62', 409, 4, 26, 817171) It is only in Malabar, I discovered on entering, that they are dressed in spotless white garments.
('62', 409, 4, 27, 817270) It is only of late that the fashion has grown among women of wearing variegated colour garments.
('62', 409, 4, 28, 817367) Yet, I have noticed that colours are not so much loved in these parts as one

('62', 410, 1, 2, 817491) would find in other parts of India.
('62', 410, 1, 3, 817527) I do not know the secret of your domestic life.
('62', 410, 1, 4, 817575) But I have flattered myself with the belief that this white garment of women of Malabar represents their internal purity.
('62', 410, 1, 5, 817697) I hope that my belief would be well placed if untouchability is removed root and branch in Malabar.
('62', 410, 1, 6, 817797) I suppose, in point of education, the women of Malabar will carry the palm.
('62', 410, 1, 7, 817873) What I want the women of Malabar to do is to save Hinduism from impending danger.
('62', 410, 1, 8, 817955) I would like you to throw over board your laziness and indifference whatever it may be.
('62', 410, 1, 9, 818043) I would like you to keep watch very vigilantly as you would do over babies.
('62', 410, 1, 10, 818119) You will treat your babies with affection.
('62', 410, 1, 11, 818162) It is not so with your religion.
('62', 410, 1, 12, 818195) The more vigilant you are, the more scientifically precise you would be.
('62', 410, 1, 13, 818268) Before you, the women of Malabar, lies a mission.
('62', 410, 1, 14, 818318) Will you try to abolish the distinction between high and low ?
('62', 410, 1, 15, 818381) Believe me, those whom we are considering as lower than ourselves are not lower in the estimation of God.
('62', 410, 1, 16, 818487) The prevalence of untouchability is due to insolence which leads to devilish interpretation of religious books.
('62', 410, 1, 17, 818599) I have never been in the habit of using exaggerated language and if I may seem to be using strong language, I feel that this con viction of mine is a very fundamental one.
('62', 410, 1, 18, 818771) What I have stated in addressing women applies to men also.
('62', 410, 1, 19, 818831) You are not free from dis belief.
('62', 410, 1, 20, 818865) Religion requires more men and women to guard it.
('62', 410, 1, 21, 818915) To put it briefly, the present movement stands for self purification.

('62', 410, 4, 25, 819071) MY DEAR BHAKTI, It is just 3.20 a.
('62', 410, 4, 26, 819106) and I have finished reading your letter undated.
('62', 410, 4, 27, 819155) Women will not think of dates!
('62', 410, 4, 28, 819186) They work for eternity and therefore they disregard human divisions of time!
('62', 410, 4, 29, 819263) Your accusation is, from your point of view, justified.
('62', 410, 4, 30, 819319) We have been rushing at such a speed that it has become impossible to keep pace with the correspondence.
('62', 410, 4, 31, 819424) Your letter (previous) is lying with me somewhere but I had no time.Today for very shame I take your letter first in order that it may not go into a bottomless file.
('62', 410, 4, 32, 819590) Though neither Mira nor I have written to you for some time, you are ever before the minds eye.
('62', 410, 4, 33, 819686) Your inseparableness, your ever genial faces and your

('62', 411, 1, 3, 819893) I know you are doing good work there.
('62', 411, 1, 4, 819931) I did read about the church peoples revolt against Hitler.

('62', 411, 1, 7, 820093) I am surprised to learn that you are not getting Harijan regu larly.
('62', 411, 1, 8, 820162) I am writing to the Editor at once.
('62', 411, 1, 9, 820198) I hope both of you are prospering in every sense of the term.
('62', 411, 1, 10, 820260) I say nothing about me, as you will learn all about me from Harijan.

('62', 411, 6, 17, 820527) January 11, 1934
('62', 411, 7, 18, 820544) FRIENDS, I would like you all to give me perfect silence.
('62', 411, 8, 19, 820602) We have here a forcible illustration of the age old truth that Man proposes but God disposes.
('62', 411, 8, 20, 820696) I had hoped to be able to speak to you on subjects of the greatest importance to you, to me and to the whole of the Hindu world.
('62', 411, 8, 21, 820825) Instead of being able to do that, I have been obliged to devote precious forty minutes to a scene that I witnessed this morning.
('62', 411, 8, 22, 820954) 4 I found two fellow countrymen lying here, stretched on the platform, one of them bleeding through the mouth and both of them apparently senseless.
('62', 411, 8, 23, 821103) The first thing, therefore, that

('62', 411, 9, 25, 821233) 2 The meeting was attended by about 2,000 people.
('62', 411, 9, 26, 821283) 3 This sentence has been taken from the Hindu report.
('62', 411, 10, 27, 821337) 4 Just before the meeting started there had been a scuffle between the volunteers and two sanatanists, Radheswara Sastri and Kalpanathji, resulting in serious injuries to both.
('62', 412, 0, 1, 821514) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 413
('62', 412, 1, 2, 821561) fell to me to do was to give the best attention that was possible for me to these fellow countrymen.
('62', 412, 1, 3, 821662) And so they have been sent under the charge of Prof.
('62', 412, 1, 4, 821715) Malkani to the dispensary here for medical attention.
('62', 412, 1, 5, 821769) In so far as a lay nurse like me can judge, I do not think that their lives are in any way in danger.
('62', 412, 1, 6, 821871) And let us all pray that they may soon be up and doing.
('62', 412, 1, 7, 821927) I understand from the two other friends who have come here on behalf of the All India Varnashrama Swarajya Sangh that they had all come here on behalf on this Sangh.
('62', 412, 1, 8, 822093) They had as perfect a right to attend this meeting as any single one of you.
('62', 412, 1, 9, 822170) They had a perfect right to stage a hostile demonstration, if they intended to, on a peaceful footing.
('62', 412, 1, 10, 822273) However repugnant it might appear to me that those who represent sanatan dharma should resort to such demonstration, I perfectly recognized their right to make such a demonstration yester day at Palghat, and I had no hesitation in making public refe rence at the meeting there to their demonstration more than to the demonstration of those who had come to greet me out of affection for me and sympathy for the cause.
('62', 412, 1, 11, 822690) And I gave then and there the reason for my saying that I appreciated this black flag demonstration more than the demonstration of affection.
('62', 412, 1, 12, 822832) I must not repeat the reason here, but I must refer you to the public speech 1 , if at all it finds publication in any of the local journals.
('62', 412, 1, 13, 822974) Here I want only to say that it was a matter of deep grief to me to find that these two countrymen were hurt, no matter for what cause, no matter by whom.
('62', 412, 1, 14, 823129) If any single volunteer or any single person connected with the organization of this meeting had any hand in assaulting these friends, I have no hesitation in saying that he has disgraced the cause and has hurt Hinduism, which he thought he was serving.
('62', 412, 1, 15, 823383) I have said repeatedly that this cause of Hinduism can only be served by men and women who are above suspicion and who have a character to keep and to lose.
('62', 412, 1, 16, 823540) In a movement of self purification there is no room for a hasty word, for a hasty action, for abuse, certainly not for bodily harm.
('62', 412, 1, 17, 823672) And if there are any persons here present who were instrumental in causing hurt to these countrymen of ours, whose lives should be as dear to you and to me as our own blood relations, then I invite them to purge themselves of that guilt by making a public declaration of their having done this injury and taking the pledge never to repeat such a dishonourable act.

('62', 413, 1, 2, 824120) Keenly and deeply as I feel the taint of untouchability and deeply as I feel convinced that, if this untouchability is not removed root and branch from Hinduism, Hinduism is bound to perish, I would not have untouchability removed by force or show of force or compulsion of any kind whatsoever.
('62', 413, 1, 3, 824415) Removal of untouchability is not a matter of law or of compulsion.
('62', 413, 1, 4, 824482) Removal of untouchability is a matter of change of heart, perfect purification on the part of millions of Hindus.
('62', 413, 1, 5, 824596) And that can only be brought about by the sacrifice of thousands of workers themselves, and not by causing injury to other people.
('62', 413, 1, 6, 824727) Hence has every scripture that I have read pronounced from the house tops that religion can only be defended by tapascharya.
('62', 413, 1, 7, 824852) I will, therefore, beseech every one of you, who crowd round me wherever I go, to remember that this movement is a movement of personal, individual self purification and self conviction.
('62', 413, 1, 8, 825039) And if you cannot approach this question from that point of view, I would far rather that I was deserted by you and that all the meetings were deserted by you.
('62', 413, 1, 9, 825199) And if any man or woman is eager to come and listen to me or to give me an ounce of milk, he or she should do so, provided he or she has got that complete identification with the cause and a perfect spirit of self purification.
('62', 413, 1, 10, 825427) Having said this and having made this declaration of my faith under the shadow of the great temple of Guruvayur, I would like to make this appeal from the bottom of my heart to those who are organizing the activities of the Varnashrama Swarajya Sangh, and kindred bodies also, to understand that they will not defend what they call sanatan dharma by staging demonstrations of the character that they have been doing.
('62', 413, 1, 11, 825844) They sent a body of men throughout the tour in C. P. who wanted to fall prostrate before the car and impede my progress at every stage.
('62', 413, 1, 12, 825980) There were often clashes between volunteers who were looking after me and this body of six or seven young men.
('62', 413, 1, 13, 826091) Fortunately, no serious or untoward event happened, though scratches certainly were inflicted on either side even during the C. P. tour, I quickly made friends with those people who were staging those obstructive demonstrations and told them as earnestly as I could that that was not the way to protect Hinduism.
('62', 413, 1, 14, 826404) 1 Some of them were youngsters who did not even know what they were doing.
('62', 413, 1, 15, 826479) With the exception of one, I doubt if any of them had any idea of the elements of Hinduism.
('62', 413, 1, 16, 826571) And I had hoped here also that, if there were such men

('62', 414, 1, 2, 826710) who wanted to stage demonstrations, I should come in touch with them, discuss with them, understand them and know who they were.
('62', 414, 1, 3, 826839) But I was sorry that hardly had I put my foot in Malabar when I was faced with the scene that I witnessed here.
('62', 414, 1, 4, 826951) It would have been better if I had been able to make their acquaintance before and ascertained what they wanted to do.
('62', 414, 1, 5, 827070) But they chose to take a different course.
('62', 414, 1, 6, 827113) I still invite them to meet me and tell me what they would exactly want me to do; and, short of stopping this tour, I would make every facility for them, and every convenience for them to express their thoughts or even to make whatever peaceful demonstrations that they might want to stage.
('62', 414, 1, 7, 827404) But what I am most anxious to avoid is goondaism in every shape and form on the part of either party.
('62', 414, 1, 8, 827506) I give the same credit to those who call themselves sanatanists for honesty of purpose that I would claim for myself, but both must have an equal right to give expression to their views and mould public opinion.
('62', 414, 1, 9, 827718) After all, sanatan dharm is not the prerogative of one set of people.
('62', 414, 1, 10, 827788) I claim myself to be a representative of sanatan dharma in every sense of the term that they claim.
('62', 414, 1, 11, 827888) I base my vehement oppo sition to untouchability upon the same Shastras by which they swear, and I should stand by my interpretation of the Shastras even though I were the solitary one amongst the millions of Hindus; because the same Shastras tell me that I may not resist the inner call of my fundamental being.
('62', 414, 1, 12, 828201) Thank God, however, that I do not stand alone in the interpretation that I have been placing before you.
('62', 414, 1, 13, 828306) On the contrary, there are learned shastris who have just as much right to interpret the Shastras as those who call themselves the exponents of sanatan dharma.
('62', 414, 1, 14, 828466) And they give precisely the same interpretation that I have placed before tens of thousands of men and women.
('62', 414, 1, 15, 828576) And it is my settled conviction, based upon an unbroken experience extending over a period of nearly fifty years, that untouchability as we practise it today has absolutely no warrant whatsoever in the Hindu Shastras.
('62', 414, 1, 16, 828794) I claim that Harijans have precisely the same common rights of worship, of use of public institutions and in all other walks of life that the tallest of Hindus enjoy in common with the rest of Hindu mankind.
('62', 414, 1, 17, 829002) And, therefore, I have not the shadow of a doubt that caste Hindu will not have performed their elementary duties by Harijans until they have thrown open the gates of Guruvayur and such ancient temples to the Harijans, precisely on the same terms on which they are open to other Hindus.
('62', 414, 1, 18, 829289) But I have infinite patience; and, as you know, although
('62', 415, 0, 1, 829346) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 416
('62', 415, 1, 2, 829388) Kelappans fast had progressed for many days, although many of these reformers were actually in the temple threatening to declare a sym pathetic fast with Kelappan and although the reformers thought that the prize was almost within their grasp, I sent a peremptory tele gram 1 from my own fasting bed, calling upon Kelappan to suspend the fast and to withdraw the men who were inside the Guruvayur temple.
('62', 415, 1, 3, 829793) And I did so because I felt that the fast was premature and I smelt coercion in it.
('62', 415, 1, 4, 829877) I mention this in order to show that I will not be guilty of being party to the opening of a single temple under coercion.
('62', 415, 1, 5, 830000) But I do want temples to be opened where public opinion is absolutely and clearly ripe for the opening of those temples.
('62', 415, 1, 6, 830121) If there is any legal obstruction in the process, I want that legal obstruction to be removed.
('62', 415, 1, 7, 830216) That is the meaning, and the only meaning, of the Temple entry Bill, and no other.
('62', 415, 1, 8, 830299) This Bill simply removes the power lessness that many trustees today feel about opening the temples under their charge because of the legal obstruction.
('62', 415, 1, 9, 830452) There is not the slightest trace of compulsion or coercion about this Temple entry Bill or the kindred Bill called the Anti untouchability Bill.
('62', 415, 1, 10, 830597) But I heard a whisper this morning that behind this temple entry agitation there is a nefarious design, if not on my part, on the part of my co workers, that we should take possession of these temples and own them.
('62', 415, 1, 11, 830812) I have no hesitation whatsoever in categorically denying this statement.
('62', 415, 1, 12, 830885) I have certainly no such design whatsoever, and I do not know of a single co worker who has any such design.
('62', 415, 1, 13, 830994) And if there is any such co worker who has such a design, he has no place whatsoever on this platform.
('62', 415, 1, 14, 831097) The possession will remain undoubtedly in the hands of those who are today lawfully in possession.
('62', 415, 1, 15, 831196) A kindred question that was asked was whether behind this there was also a design to undermine Brahminism.
('62', 415, 1, 16, 831303) I can only tell you that I cannot be guilty of any such design; for, to me to undermine Brahmi nism is to undermine Hinduism.
('62', 415, 1, 17, 831429) This does not mean endorsement of the claim that the Brahmins, so called, may put forth today.
('62', 415, 1, 18, 831524) No man can be accepted as a Brahmin by society merely by reason of his birth.
('62', 415, 1, 19, 831602) The Shastras themselves say that a born Brahmin who does not act according to the requirements of Brahminism will forfeit his right to be called a Brahmin by the people in general.
('62', 415, 1, 20, 831783) There are Brahmins themselves today in this very movement who say that they cannot be called Brahmins unless they carry out the precepts of the Shastras

('62', 416, 0, 1, 831993) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 417
('62', 416, 1, 2, 832040) referring to them.
('62', 416, 1, 3, 832059) I believe that the Brahmin is the cornerstone of Hinduism, as of every other religion.
('62', 416, 1, 4, 832146) But there you must understand the meaning of the word Brahmin.
('62', 416, 1, 5, 832209) The Brahmin is the person who has realized Brahman.
('62', 416, 1, 6, 832261) If he has not that realization in every act of his, he shows that he is ever after it and nothing else.
('62', 416, 1, 7, 832365) Such a Brahmin demands my ten thousand prostrations every morning, but not the Brahmin who is dictated by self, who is multiplying himself 1 day after day and thinks mostly of himself, rarely of others, nor even the Brahmin who smears himself with ashes from top to toe and can punctiliously and correctly recite the Vedas.
('62', 416, 1, 8, 832689) It may be necessary for him to smear himself with ashes.
('62', 416, 1, 9, 832746) It is necessary for him to translate the Vedas in his own life.
('62', 416, 1, 10, 832810) It is necessary for him to exhibit Brahman in every act of his life.
('62', 416, 1, 11, 832879) It is necessary for him to be pure and to impart that purity to all his surroundings.
('62', 416, 1, 12, 832965) It is necessary for him to be ever ready to die so that others may live.
('62', 416, 1, 13, 833038) Now you understand what regard I have for the true Brahmin and Brahminism.
('62', 416, 1, 14, 833113) Having heard this probably the writer of a printed letter which was placed in my hands this morning does not want replies to the several questions which he has put me and to which he has expected replies this morning.
('62', 416, 1, 15, 833331) But I can say this much to him that, if he wants a detailed reply to everyone of the questions that he has raised here, he can get it by turning to the file of Harijan.
('62', 416, 1, 16, 833500) He will there find also that, in putting the interpretations that he has put in his letter on several things, he has undoubtedly misread the message of the Gita and the message of Hinduism.
('62', 416, 2, 17, 833690) Lastly he has asked for an interview with me.
('62', 416, 2, 18, 833736) I am sorry that he cannot have it at Guruvayur, but he can have it at Calicut on the 16th instant at ten oclock in the morning.
('62', 416, 2, 19, 833864) I had an invitation for a discussion yesterday at Palghat with some learned pundits.
('62', 416, 2, 20, 833949) I was sorry to have to disappoint them so far as Palghat was concerned, because, when I received their invitation, I was making preparations for leaving Palghat.
('62', 416, 2, 21, 834111) But I have given them ten oclock in the morning at Calicut on the 16th instant, and I would be glad to see this friend and any other friends who may wish to converse with me on every one of the points that I have discussed here and any other points that may arise in the course of that discussion.
('62', 416, 2, 22, 834409) Though the 16th instant is supposed to be an off day, it is not a day of recreation for me.
('62', 416, 2, 23, 834501) Therefore I was obliged to restrict the interview to half an hour in my letter to the
('62', 416, 3, 24, 834587) 1 The Hindu report here has; who has multiplied insults.
('62', 417, 0, 1, 834644) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 418
('62', 417, 1, 2, 834686) pundits.
('62', 417, 1, 3, 834695) But I propose now to devote one hour for that discussion, so that the pundits may have the whole half hour to themselves, if they chose to take it.
('62', 417, 1, 4, 834843) 1 I have absolutely nothing to withhold from any single person, nor have I the slightest desire to hide my ignorance.
('62', 417, 1, 5, 834961) I have already set forth my limits.
('62', 417, 1, 6, 834997) I do not profess to be a learned man in any sense of the term.
('62', 417, 1, 7, 835060) I profess to be a humble seeker, ever ready and ever anxious to follow literally every precept of Hindu religion as I know it.
('62', 417, 1, 8, 835187) I, therefore, freely confess that, if the pundits or anybody else invited me to to a recital of the Vedas or an exposition of the Vedas and so on, they would floor me entirely.
('62', 417, 1, 9, 835364) But they will not easily dislodge me from the position that I occupy.
('62', 417, 1, 10, 835434) If a knowledge of God or if a knowledge of the fundamental precepts of Hinduism had depended upon a meticulous knowledge of all the Vedas and a forest of books, then hardly any person would be able to say, I know something of God..
('62', 417, 1, 11, 835666) But these scriptures say that to know God is possible for every single human being on earth if he purifies his heart.
('62', 417, 1, 12, 835784) I must thank you sincerely for the silence with which you have listened to me.
('62', 417, 1, 13, 835863) Now I want you to join me in prayer to God Almighty that He may direct our steps in the right direction and that He may give us the strength that is necessary to exorcize this devil of untouchability from our hearts.
('62', 417, 1, 14, 836080) Lastly, please remember that those who believe that untouchability is an evil and who believe also that it can be exorcized only by self purification should never hurt a single hair of those who are opposing this movement.
('62', 417, 1, 15, 836303) On the contrary, you and I have to see to it that we win them over by our own correct conduct and by gentle persuasion.
('62', 417, 1, 16, 836423) I, therefore, ask you to treat those two friends, who are now in the dispensary, and those who might be representing the Varnashrama Swarajya Sangh, with respect and affection and as your guests.
('62', 417, 1, 17, 836619) Irrespective of what they may do, let them experience the warmth of your hospitality and affection and not your bitter reproach.

('62', 417, 2, 19, 836793) 1 The pundits did not accept the invitation.
('62', 417, 2, 20, 836838) Instead they wrote to Gandhiji that they would see him if he was prepared to discuss the Shastras with them not for an hour but for days together and that too in Sanskrit.

('62', 418, 1, 2, 837057) 449. SPEECH AT PATTAMBI 1
('62', 418, 2, 3, 837083) January 11, 1934
('62', 418, 3, 4, 837100) It has given me some surprise that in Malabar, the land of eternal green, you have to use artificial paper flowers.
('62', 418, 3, 5, 837216) I thought that in Malabar, where Nature has been so beneficent to you, you could avoid all artificiality.
('62', 418, 3, 6, 837322) But I suppose that in order to appreciate the beauty of this land you require the help of a person who comes from a treeless desert as I do.
('62', 418, 3, 7, 837463) Just as you have gone in for artificiality in the matter of flowers, you go in for artificiality in the matter of untouchability, and then you think that that artificial product comes from Divinity itself.
('62', 418, 3, 8, 837669) I have come to warn you against the belief that untouchability, unapproachability or invisibility can have any divine sanction.
('62', 418, 3, 9, 837797) In my opinion it is one of the greatest sins that we, Hindus, have been committing against man and God.
('62', 418, 3, 10, 837901) You degrade human beings, as we have been doing in this part of the world, and then to say that they are what they are because of their past deeds is a complete caricature of the law of karma.
('62', 418, 3, 11, 838094) I claim to know somewhat, from first hand evidence, of the working of the law of karma, because practically a period of fifty years I have devoted to find out what this law of karma could be.
('62', 418, 3, 12, 838286) And this much I do know that to apply it to everybody else but ourselves is to distort it altogether; and if I had more time than I have at my disposal, I could show to the satisfaction of every one of you that you can never apply the law of karma as you apply it to the Nayadis and others.
('62', 418, 3, 13, 838577) If we were to apply the law of karma as I have suggested, that is to say, towards ourselves, you would find the land here and elsewhere transformed.
('62', 418, 3, 14, 838726) I have, therefore, come to beseech every one of you to exorcize this ghost of untouchability.
('62', 418, 3, 15, 838820) If you do not, you may be sure that that ghost will eat us up.
('62', 418, 3, 16, 838883) Harijan, 19 1 1934
('62', 418, 4, 17, 838902) 450. NOTES FRIENDLY DISCUSSION ALWAYS WELCOME During my brief stay in Madras I saw in the papers that a public appeal signed by certain gentlemen was made to me.
('62', 418, 4, 18, 839064) In it, I was asked to hold a public discussion about untouchability.
('62', 418, 4, 19, 839133) Later on I received a printed copy of that appeal, with the following opening words typed at the top :
('62', 418, 5, 20, 839236) 1 Extracted from Chandrashankar Shuklas Weekly Letter
('62', 419, 0, 1, 839290) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 420
('62', 419, 1, 2, 839332) As a man posing to know more, please come out and discuss.
('62', 419, 2, 3, 839391) say, No time, no time.
('62', 419, 2, 4, 839414) It is a shame to say so when your very existence is
('62', 419, 3, 5, 839466) questioned.
('62', 419, 3, 6, 839478) World will laugh at you and will mock at you.
('62', 419, 4, 7, 839524) Then follows this astonishing paragraph :
('62', 419, 5, 8, 839566) Abandoning all his political activities which had really brought him
('62', 419, 6, 9, 839635) into the limelight of Indian politics, destroyingfor all practical purposes
('62', 419, 7, 10, 839711) the great Indian National Congress which had made him its virtual dictator and
('62', 419, 8, 11, 839790) blindly entrusted its destiny into his hands and agonizing not merely the orthodox sanatanadharmis but also all lovers of Indian nationalism in the
('62', 419, 9, 12, 839938) land, Mr. Gandhi has, of late, begun a whirlwind propaganda against
('62', 419, 10, 13, 840006) untouchability and in favour of temple entry legislation, whereon he has been putting forth his ipse dixits and obiter dicta before the public, not as his own
('62', 419, 11, 14, 840165) individual views or in the name of Rousseau, Tolstoy, Lenin, etc., but under
('62', 419, 12, 15, 840242) the banner of sanatan dharma, sociology, abstract justice and so on!
('62', 419, 13, 16, 840311) I had some such appeal again whilst I was travelling in Nellore District.
('62', 419, 14, 17, 840385) telegram inviting me to a discussion says :
('62', 419, 15, 18, 840429) It appears to us that you have not understood the Hindu dharma and have
('62', 419, 16, 19, 840501) been leading the Hindus astray from the path of true moral and religious life.
('62', 419, 16, 20, 840580) I was not able to reply to these invitations there and then : the last invitation was received at Venkatagiri 1 at 10 oclock at night.
('62', 419, 16, 21, 840715) The next day I was to reach Tirupati, near which I was to go to the proposed discussion.
('62', 419, 16, 22, 840804) I had to be content with sending a verbal message to my host at Tirupati.
('62', 419, 16, 23, 840878) As to the first invitation, I had sent the message that I was ready to hold a friendly discussion with anybody and to be convinced of my error, if it could be brought home to me.
('62', 419, 16, 24, 841057) I had to say that my time was limited and that the discussion would only take place, at my decision, wherever it might be for the time being.
('62', 419, 16, 25, 841199) My limitations I had set forth in these columns times without number : I am no Sanskrit scholar, but I know sufficient to detect errors in translations that may be given to me.
('62', 419, 16, 26, 841376) I claim to have read the Shastras to my satisfaction, and I claim to have endeavoured from my youth upwards to put into practice the fundamental precepts of the Shastras.
('62', 419, 16, 27, 841547) Thus I have no hesitation in putting before the public, with the utmost confidence, the conclusions I have reached regarding certain fundamentals of Hinduism.
('62', 419, 16, 28, 841706) One of the conclusions I have reached is
('62', 419, 17, 29, 841747) 1 On December 30, 1933
('62', 420, 0, 1, 841770) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 421
('62', 420, 1, 2, 841817) that there is no warrant in the Shastras for untouchability as it is practised today.
('62', 420, 1, 3, 841903) My conclusion is supported by shastris no less learned than those who challenge my conclusion, and the former claim to be just as good sanatanists as those who hold the opposite view, but I always believe in regarding opponents with respect and, therefore, listening to what they might have to say.
('62', 420, 1, 4, 842202) I have held discussions with them more than once, and these have resulted in strengthening my convictions.
('62', 420, 1, 5, 842309) Therefore, whilst I feel that myopinion will not be shaken by any such discussions, I am quite willing to find time for those who could be good enough to suit themselves to my daily engagements.
('62', 420, 1, 6, 842504) I dare not disturb the programme that has been settled in advance for several months to come.
('62', 420, 1, 7, 842598) I have already had discussions with sanatanists during the tour at several places.
('62', 420, 1, 8, 842681) If those who write to me directly or indirectly through the Press will observe the laws of common courtesy and if they have the desire to find a basis for common work, I have no doubt that there are many points of agreement, even on the question of temple entry and the proposed legislation.
('62', 420, 1, 9, 842973) Much mis understanding can be removed by mutual and friendly discussion.
('62', 420, 1, 10, 843046) I may mention for the information of the general reader that, as against sanatanists who are enraged against me and fling all sorts of abuses at me, I frequently meet those who, having understood the central point of my message, have become supporters.
('62', 420, 1, 11, 843299) I have no weapon with me except the one of an appeal to the reason and heart of the people.
('62', 420, 1, 12, 843391) The reform that I am advocating can only come through a change of heart on the part of millions of Hindus.
('62', 420, 1, 13, 843498) Therefore, it is in the interest of my mission that I lose not a single opportunity of meeting my opponent, whenever it is possible for me to do so.

('62', 420, 4, 16, 843718) BHAI GOVINDBHAI,
('62', 420, 5, 17, 843735) I have written to you saying that I had written a long letter to Shri Aurobindo.
('62', 420, 5, 18, 843816) I have received no reply till today.
('62', 420, 5, 19, 843853) I have written to you in reply to your English letter, too, and

('62', 421, 5, 6, 844148) January 13, 1934
('62', 421, 6, 7, 844165) MANILAL AND SUSHILA, I got the letters from both of you.
('62', 421, 6, 8, 844222) I hope you get my letters regularly.
('62', 421, 6, 9, 844259) Of late I have not missed a single mail.
('62', 421, 6, 10, 844300) With my last letter I had enclosed a copy of Bas letter.
('62', 421, 6, 11, 844357) Sushila has given sufficiently detailed news about Shanti.
('62', 421, 6, 12, 844416) If he does not waste money in fanciful ventures, I am satisfied.
('62', 421, 6, 13, 844481) Sushila wishes to know who are in my party.
('62', 421, 6, 14, 844525) I think I have already written about that.
('62', 421, 6, 15, 844568) Chandrashankar, Mirabehn, Om, Kisanbehn (Premabehns friend), Professor Malkani (Thakkar Bapas represen tative), two accountantsVishwanath and Damodarone store keeper Sharma and one typistthese form the party.
('62', 421, 6, 16, 844777) Personally I like Sita being talkative and mischievous.
('62', 421, 6, 17, 844833) It is for the parents to put these qualities to good use.
('62', 421, 6, 18, 844891) They can in this way impart a good deal of education.
('62', 421, 6, 19, 844945) Naughtiness and talkativeness are a kind of energy, like steam.
('62', 421, 6, 20, 845009) The energy of steam is conserved and used to drive big trains and steamboats.
('62', 421, 6, 21, 845087) A childs energy can be used in a similar manner.
('62', 421, 6, 22, 845136) If we understand it and use it wisely, it can produce excellent results.
('62', 421, 6, 23, 845209) Instead of making Sita write the letters of the alphabet, you should teach her just now to draw geometrical figures.
('62', 421, 6, 24, 845326) After that you may teach her to draw pictures of objects and last of all to write the letters.
('62', 421, 6, 25, 845421) But before doing that you should teach her to recognize the letters, and to understand the meaning of words.
('62', 421, 6, 26, 845530) You can give her some knowledge daily through stories.
('62', 421, 6, 27, 845585) You can easily teach her some thing about history, geography, science and tell her
('62', 421, 7, 28, 845668) 1 According to the addressee, he communicated the contents of this letter to Mother and inquired if it was true that Gandhiji had asked for at least a line in Shri Aurobindos hand; and Shri Aurobindo has written a full letter in his own hand which he does not usually do.
('62', 421, 7, 29, 845940) In reply, Shri Aurobindo wrote in pencil on the note : Yes, I wrote to him a short letter explaining the nature of my retirement and regretting that I could not break my rule as long as the reason for it existed.
('62', 421, 7, 30, 846153) It was addressed to Bangalore, I believe, and ought to have reached him, unless it has been pocketed by the C.I.D. I suppose even if he had left Banaglore it would have been forwarded to him.
('62', 421, 7, 31, 846345) You can write and inform him of the fact.
('62', 422, 0, 1, 846387) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 423
('62', 422, 1, 2, 846434) stories from the Ramayana and the Mahabharata.
('62', 422, 1, 3, 846481) She can learn all these things in play.
('62', 422, 1, 4, 846521) This will not tire you; on the contrary you will enjoy teaching her in this manner.
('62', 422, 1, 5, 846605) Through this you yourself will learn something daily and Sita will get the best possible education.
('62', 422, 1, 6, 846705) She can learn English, Gujarati and also Hindi at the same time.
('62', 422, 1, 7, 846770) What help do you give to Manilal ?
('62', 422, 1, 8, 846805) Did either of you see West ?
('62', 422, 1, 9, 846834) Please meet him and give me some news of him.
('62', 422, 1, 10, 846880) I shall be satisfied if he is not unhappy.
('62', 422, 1, 11, 846923) You should show yourself always ready to help.
('62', 422, 1, 12, 846970) Ba seems to be all right.
('62', 422, 1, 13, 846996) This time she does not appear to enjoy as much freedom as before.
('62', 422, 1, 14, 847062) I did not understand Pragjis letter to you.
('62', 422, 1, 15, 847106) I do not remember in what context we had the talk and what I had said.
('62', 422, 1, 16, 847177) In any case, what I may have said does not apply to you two.
('62', 422, 1, 17, 847238) The facts are not the same in all cases.
('62', 422, 1, 18, 847279) We may have dicussed what his duty was in India.
('62', 422, 1, 19, 847328) It is of course true in a sense that, if the struggle here succeeds, the solution of the problem in that country will soon follow.
('62', 422, 1, 20, 847459) But that certainly does not mean that anybody should leave that country and come away to India.
('62', 422, 1, 21, 847555) The rule that better is death in the discharge of ones duty 1
('62', 422, 2, 22, 847617) is perfectly true in this case.
('62', 422, 2, 23, 847649) You two, therefore, should go on doing the work which is your dharma at present.
('62', 422, 2, 24, 847730) It will be enough if you do not depart from the path of dharma in doing that work.
('62', 422, 2, 25, 847813) Devdas has been released.
('62', 422, 2, 26, 847839) He will spend his time in Delhi and other places for the present.
('62', 422, 2, 27, 847905) He will come and see me.
('62', 422, 2, 28, 847930) He has kept good health.

('62', 422, 2, 35, 848176) Write to Devdas and Lakshmi.
('62', 422, 2, 36, 848205) And continue to write to Ramdas and Nimu regularly.

('62', 423, 2, 3, 848545) January 13, 1934
('62', 423, 3, 4, 848562) DAHYABHAI, I have your letter.
('62', 423, 3, 5, 848593) I got three letters almost simultaneously which may be regarded as an instance of telepathy.
('62', 423, 3, 6, 848686) Mahadev is being tested severely.
('62', 423, 3, 7, 848720) Possibly he might suffer a little loss of health, though no other hardship.
('62', 423, 3, 8, 848796) I have sent a detailed message in reply to the letter to Jivanji.
('62', 423, 3, 9, 848862) However, the next time you have a chance write as follows : 1
('62', 423, 4, 10, 848924) Whilst I need not receive Mahadevs letters, he must not think that I cannot have time to read them.
('62', 423, 4, 11, 849024) The Gita portion was technical and I felt that there was no immediate need for me to give my opinion.
('62', 423, 4, 12, 849126) And the fact is that I have so little regard for my own technical meaning of the verses.
('62', 423, 4, 13, 849215) Where the meaning does not fit in with my interpretation as a whole, I should naturally have to examine it but speaking in general terms one meaning would be to me as good as any other and therefore I should readily accept Mahadevs considered interpretation in preference to my own which after all must have been an adoption of some single authors version.
('62', 423, 4, 14, 849572) He should therefore prosecute his researches and his work of translation without waiting for my opinion.
('62', 423, 4, 15, 849677) When it is all completed of course I shall have ample time, God willing, to go through it.
('62', 423, 4, 16, 849768) I take it that Mahadev has read B. Shaws Adventures of the Black Girl in Her Search for God.
('62', 423, 4, 17, 849861) I am sending him today, Adventures of the White Girl in Her Search for God by Cff.
('62', 423, 4, 18, 849944) Maxwell.
('62', 423, 4, 19, 849953) If he gets it safely, he will acknowledge it in his next letter.
('62', 423, 4, 20, 850018) When I reach Belgaum I shall try to see Mani and Mahadev.

('62', 424, 2, 3, 850292) January 13, 1934
('62', 424, 3, 4, 850309) FRIENDS, I am very much obliged to you for the addresses and the purse you have presented to me.
('62', 424, 3, 5, 850406) You know the nature of the mission at the present moment taking me from one end of India to the other.
('62', 424, 3, 6, 850509) In pursuance of that mission early this morning I have come here to ask you to rid yourselves of the devil of untouchability from your hearts.
('62', 424, 3, 7, 850652) I see in all your addresses there is one note running, namely, that this monster of untouchability might be laid low.
('62', 424, 3, 8, 850770) Let us not make the mistake of supposing that this is a work that has got to be done by somebody else.
('62', 424, 3, 9, 850873) It is essentially a work that has got to be done by everybodyby himself or herselffor it is a matter essentially of a change of heart on the part of the caste Hindus or savarna Hindus as they are called.
('62', 424, 3, 10, 851077) They have to cease to think that they are caste Hindus or that some of them are savarnas and others avarnas.
('62', 424, 3, 11, 851186) This distinction of high and low has destroyed society altogether and as we want to save ourselves from impending destruction, we must cease to think that anybody on earth is lower than ourselves.
('62', 424, 3, 12, 851383) The poison of untouchability has spread so far and so wide that even amongst caste and caste there is a grave degree of untouchabilty.
('62', 424, 3, 13, 851518) In this distinction of high and low, we have gone further, and the poison has enveloped all the communities.
('62', 424, 3, 14, 851627) There is untouc hability not merely amongst Hindus and Hindus, savarnas and avarnas, savarnas and savarnas, but there is untouchability also between Hindus, Muslims, Parsis, and Christians.
('62', 424, 3, 15, 851817) I am convinced that, whilst there may be other reasons for inter communal quarrels, I have no doubt whatsoever that untouc hability is the main and deciding reason for the majority of these quarrels.
('62', 424, 3, 16, 852017) Therefore, if we will exorcize this principal manifestation of the devil of untouchability, I have not even a shadow of doubt that we will be able to right the wrong all along the line.
('62', 424, 3, 17, 852203) One of your addresses mentions that most of the temples are not open to Harijans and that only one temple, opened by the followers of Shri Narayana Guru, is open to Harijans.
('62', 424, 3, 18, 852378) I congratula te the trustees of the temple on their liberality and I hope that their example will be followed by other trustees; but it will largely depend upon the temple going public to bring about that change.
('62', 424, 3, 19, 852591) If the temple goers are sincerely penitent
('62', 424, 4, 20, 852634) 1 The meeting, which was attended by more than 6,000 people, was held at the Tellicherry maidan at 7.30 a.

('62', 425, 1, 2, 852783) and feel that hitherto they have done serious wrongs to Harijans by prohibiting them from entering the temples, I have no doubt that their expression of opinion cannot be challenged and the temples will be soon opened.
('62', 425, 1, 3, 853002) I am therefore hoping that you will organize public opinion so that the temples may soon be opened to Harijans precisely on the same terms as they are open to other Hindus.
('62', 425, 1, 4, 853175) I am surprised to discover that there was in some place near here bad blood between untouchables and untouchables, that is between Pulayas and Thiyyas.
('62', 425, 1, 5, 853327) I do hope that the Harijans all over will set their house in order and rid themselves of untouchability within untouchability.
('62', 425, 1, 6, 853454) Now you have given me this purse which I only consider as a token of your determination to deal with this evil in a final manner.

('62', 425, 3, 9, 853643) January 13, 1934
('62', 425, 4, 10, 853660) FRIENDS, I have a peculiar pleasure in being in your midst since you are in a part of French India.
('62', 425, 4, 11, 853760) I had the pleasure of visiting Chandanagore in Bengal more than once.
('62', 425, 4, 12, 853830) But this is my first visit to French India in this part of the country.
('62', 425, 4, 13, 853902) For me whether it is French India or British India it is one and the same country.
('62', 425, 4, 14, 853985) The same blood flows through my veins that goes through yours, the same soil, the same atmosphere, the same manners and customs and many things too numerous to mention are common to all of us.
('62', 425, 4, 15, 854178) But for the difference in the uniform of your police and the French language I read here and there I would notice no difference whatsoever.
('62', 425, 4, 16, 854318) Therefore it is a matter of no surprise to me that you have, whilst I am passing through Malabar, invited me and presented me with a purse for the Harijan cause.
('62', 425, 4, 17, 854480) Indeed I would have been surprised, and painfully surprised, if I had found that, whilst I was actually passing through this road, you took no notice whatsoever of the self styled representative of the Harijans.
('62', 425, 4, 18, 854692) Therefore I am glad to be able to be present in your midst even though it is only for a few minutes.
('62', 425, 4, 19, 854793) I was glad to discover that an important temple in this place was thrown open to Harijans precisely on the same terms as to other Hindus.
('62', 425, 5, 20, 854931) 1 At the meeting Gandhiji was presented with addresses on behalf of the public and students of Hindi.
('62', 426, 0, 1, 855033) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 427
('62', 426, 1, 2, 855080) congratulate the trustees on having performed this very simple religious duty.
('62', 426, 1, 3, 855159) Now, I hope you know what I am after in pursuing this mission.
('62', 426, 1, 4, 855222) I would like you to understand that mere opening of temples, mere opening of schools for Harijans does not constitute the whole of my mission.
('62', 426, 1, 5, 855365) It means that savarna Hindus have got to purify their hearts and, make due reparations to the Harijans whom they have hitherto suppressed.
('62', 426, 1, 6, 855504) It means that we should abolish all distinctions of high and low and realize that we are children of one country and as such, should realize that, being children of one country, there can be no distinction of high and low.
('62', 426, 1, 7, 855727) May God help us to realize this very simple idea.
('62', 426, 1, 8, 855777) I am glad of this Hindi address and I would like every one of you here to appreciate this message of Hindi.
('62', 426, 1, 9, 855885) The Hindu, 16 1 1934
('62', 426, 2, 10, 855906) 456. SPEECH AT OPENING OF DISPENSARY, PAKKANARPURAM January 13, 1934 I have been invited to open the dispensary that you see in front of you in the name of a young brave worker who sacrificed himself for the sake of his country and died some years ago in about 1921. His name is Balakrishna Menon.
('62', 426, 2, 11, 856204) And this dispensary will be called after his name.
('62', 426, 2, 12, 856255) In those days of non co operation at its height, he, in common with others, was confined in jail and it is in his memory that this dispensary is to be named.
('62', 426, 2, 13, 856413) Medical relief has been given to hundreds of Harijans.
('62', 426, 2, 14, 856468) Within the last four or five months over two thousand patients have been treated free of charge.
('62', 426, 2, 15, 856565) Let us hope that this dispensary will grow day after day, that is to say, it would be an instrument of ever increasing service to ailing humanity.
('62', 426, 2, 16, 856712) I understand that a young medical practioner has offered to give his services free of charge.
('62', 426, 2, 17, 856806) Let us hope that such self sacrificing young men will multiply in this land.
('62', 426, 2, 18, 856883) We do need young medical men who have the requisite spirit of self sacrifice and who will consent to live in villages.
('62', 426, 2, 19, 857002) It is absolutely necessary that Harijans should receive medical aid.
('62', 426, 2, 20, 857071) I know and I am grieved that there are medical practitioners in India who disgrace their profession by refusing to touch Harijans lest the touch might pollute them.
('62', 426, 2, 21, 857236) Therefore, it fills me with joy whenever I find a medical practitioner who is entirely free from those superstitions and at the same time has the spirit of sacrifice to enable him to give his services free of charge.
('62', 426, 2, 22, 857453) Whilst giving medical relief, providing for education and arranging for free water supply are
('62', 427, 0, 1, 857547) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 428
('62', 427, 1, 2, 857589) necessary in the interests of Harijans, there is something still more necessary to be done by the savarna Hindus.
('62', 427, 1, 3, 857703) We have to cease to be patrons.
('62', 427, 1, 4, 857735) We have been oppressing the Harijans for centuries.
('62', 427, 1, 5, 857787) We have to purify ourselves from this taint of untouchability immediately and take the Harijans to our bosom.
('62', 427, 1, 6, 857897) We have to consider them as our blood brothers and sisters.
('62', 427, 1, 7, 857957) It is a sin to consider any single human being to be lower than ourselves.
('62', 427, 1, 8, 858032) It is blasphemy to consider that God can have any partiality with regard to His children.
('62', 427, 1, 9, 858122) I would consider this dispensary a success if it lends itself to eradicate the distinction of high and low to some extent.

('62', 427, 3, 12, 858305) January 13, 1934
('62', 427, 4, 13, 858322) DEAR SISTERS, I see that all of you are seized with a peculiar fear lest I might induce you and you might feel irresistibly tempted to part with all your ornaments.
('62', 427, 4, 14, 858487) Some of you have already begun to give your trinkets.
('62', 427, 4, 15, 858541) I propose to give you tonight a beautiful story of a girl called Kaumudi.
('62', 427, 4, 16, 858615) I saw her for the first time this morning at Badagara and in response to an appeal I made to the ladies to give their jewellery, and, if they had the desire, all their jewellery, this little girl KaumudiI call her little comparativelyI suppose she was about 20 years, probably 21 1 and she came forward and began with her two beauti ful bangles, the only bangles she had on her wrists.
('62', 427, 4, 17, 859001) I was more than satisfied but not she.
('62', 427, 4, 18, 859040) Out she came with her very beautiful necklace.
('62', 427, 4, 19, 859087) I thought she would stop at that.
('62', 427, 4, 20, 859121) But she would not.
('62', 427, 4, 21, 859140) Her hands involuntarily went to her ears and she suddenly thought there was something in her ears also, and was delighted to give her ear rings.
('62', 427, 4, 22, 859285) I was very deeply touched,but I suprressed my emotion at that time.
('62', 427, 4, 23, 859353) Istraightaway enquired whether she was an independent girl or whether she had obtained the consent of her father.
('62', 427, 4, 24, 859467) And I immediately learnt that she had done this in the presence of her father because he was on the platform helping me to get my addresses and other trinkets.
('62', 427, 4, 25, 859627) I then learnt that the father was also entirely with his girl in her giving everything that was on her person to
('62', 427, 5, 26, 859740) 1 In fact she was 16 years old; vide Vol. LVII, Kaumudis Renunciation, 19 1 1934.
('62', 428, 0, 1, 859822) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 429
('62', 428, 1, 2, 859869) the Harijan cause.
('62', 428, 1, 3, 859888) All she wanted was an autograph for her two bangles.
('62', 428, 1, 4, 859941) Of course I gave her more than my autograph.
('62', 428, 1, 5, 859986) I wrote there in Hindi that her great sacrifice would be a truer ornament than her gold and jewel things.
('62', 428, 1, 6, 860092) She went very delighted.
('62', 428, 1, 7, 860117) And I had her definite promise that she was not going to ask her father to replace those articles of jewellery.
('62', 428, 1, 8, 860229) She has enough and more articles to wear and jewellery also.
('62', 428, 1, 9, 860290) Of course for a Malabar girl this is not an amazing performance.
('62', 428, 1, 10, 860355) Because so far as my knowledge goes, Malabar girls are the simplest of all the girls in the world.
('62', 428, 1, 11, 860454) Somehow or other they have left on my mind the impression that they have the least desire for jewellery.
('62', 428, 1, 12, 860559) I may be wholly mistaken.
('62', 428, 1, 13, 860585) Anyway that is the impression that they have left on my mind.
('62', 428, 1, 14, 860647) I must conclude this soul stirring story by adding another story.
('62', 428, 1, 15, 860713) Now nearly ten years ago 1 or more there was a girl in Andhradesha who was married and when I made an appeal to the sisters thereit was an imposing meeting of women in a theatreshe was the first to give me her ornaments.
('62', 428, 1, 16, 860934) Although Sri Annapurnammas jewels wer comparatively simple, still her necklace or her chain as I might call it was a long heavy chain of pure gold.
('62', 428, 1, 17, 861082) I must not describe other articles of her jewellery.
('62', 428, 1, 18, 861135) Alas, she is no more.
('62', 428, 1, 19, 861157) But let me inform you that she was true to her promise cent percent that she would not replace those rich articles of jewellery.
('62', 428, 1, 20, 861286) She had very rich parents, who would gladly have given her all their jewellery to replace hers.
('62', 428, 1, 21, 861382) But from that time up to the time of her death which took place now three years ago 2 she never wore an article of jewellery.
('62', 428, 1, 22, 861508) It is my certain conviction that Annapurnamma gained by giving and so has Kaumudi.
('62', 428, 1, 23, 861591) I have lingered on those two very sacred illustrations and I want to tell you that in discarding your jewellery for a cause so sacred as the Harijan cause you will be doing nothing wonderful.
('62', 428, 1, 24, 861783) [Women have done such things] when they have taken up the defence of a sacred cause like this.
('62', 428, 1, 25, 861878) I have to ask you, to beseech you, to purify your hearts of the sin of untouchability, to treat Harijan boys and girls as if they are your own children, brothers and sisters.
('62', 428, 1, 26, 862053) We have for long ages supressed Harijans and today if we sacrifice our all for their sake we shall be only making some slight and tardy reparation for all the wrongs inflicted upon them in the name of religion.
('62', 428, 1, 27, 862264) Therefore, whatever you give, whether it is a trinket or heavy piece of jewellery or

('62', 429, 3, 7, 862889) January 13, 1934 I am much obliged to you for these addresses that have been presented to me this evening and I thank you for the self restraint you have imposed upon yourselves by not desiring to read these addresses to me.
('62', 429, 3, 8, 863114) Only you have thereby appreciated the fact that I have been going from one place to another from day to day, now for over two months, and at the end of the day I am therefore fatigued.
('62', 429, 3, 9, 863299) You, wise men that you are, have appreciated this act and absolved me from the duty of having to listen to these addresses.
('62', 429, 3, 10, 863423) You having exercised this self restraint, naturally it was up to me to read those addresses and be prepared.
('62', 429, 3, 11, 863532) But I must say to you that I had no notion whatsoever that I was to have all these addresses nor have I been given copies of these addresses.
('62', 429, 3, 12, 863674) Had I been given copies I would certainly have read them.
('62', 429, 3, 13, 863732) However I have no doubt whatsoever that these addresses contain nothing more than what I have noticed in the numerous addresses that I have been receiving throughout these two months or more.
('62', 429, 3, 14, 863924) Almost without exception they have expressed to me great joy, not only their sympathy with the cause that I am espousing for the time being but they have in these addresses signified their intention, nay their deter mination, of doing everythingthat these various bodies of gentlemen or ladies could possibly do in their own sphere to advance the Harijans cause.
('62', 429, 3, 15, 864287) It has given me a great deal of satisfaction and joy to discover that there is consensus of opinion on the part of the intelligentsia.
('62', 429, 3, 16, 864422) I would have been painfully surprised if it had been otherwise.
('62', 429, 3, 17, 864486) Not only has it been so with reference to the intelligentsia but as far as mere assent goes, I have found to my great delight the masses also are

('62', 429, 4, 19, 864673) Addresses were presented to Gandhiji on behalf of the Municipal Council, Malabar Chamber of Commerce, Taluk Board, Harijan Yuvak Sangh and other bodies.
('62', 430, 0, 1, 864826) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 431
('62', 430, 1, 2, 864873) equally with this movement.
('62', 430, 1, 3, 864901) I am not easily self deluded.
('62', 430, 1, 4, 864931) I have no doubt that I have, must have, my due share of self delusion or else life perhaps would be a positive burden to most of us if not to all of us.
('62', 430, 1, 5, 865084) But due allowance having been made for self delusion I can say that all these scenes that I witness every day cannot possibly be a matter of masses or classes coming to me to signify their praise or their satisfaction for services that I might have performed in a previous life or in days gone by.
('62', 430, 1, 6, 865382) This life has rushed and with me it has rushed with such rapidity that it is impossible for me to have a clear photography of the events that have happened and, that being the case, I should be intensely surprised and also disappointed that these classes and masses had signified not only their satisfaction and their sympathy by their presence at these meetings but also given me donations more or less and had done certain acts also as a consideration for those services.
('62', 430, 1, 7, 865856) I would let that pass by.
('62', 430, 1, 8, 865882) I am assuming that all your addresses contain a serious and solemn pledge that you are determined to do everything that is humanly possible for you to do to render the reparation that is overdue to the Harijans.
('62', 430, 1, 9, 866094) Malabar, if one were to draw the untouchability map of the whole of India, I suppose will easily wear the black crown and Malabar would be the blackest spot so far as untouchability is concerned.
('62', 430, 1, 10, 866290) It is a matter of regret but it is no use ignoring the fact.
('62', 430, 1, 11, 866351) I would turn this blackness to good account and I would invite you to gird up your loins and make such Heruclean effort that at the end of the struggle it may be possible to say of Malabar that Malabar had been in the vanguard of progress in this battle against the monster of untouc hability.
('62', 430, 1, 12, 866645) Let it be said of Malabar that Malabar counted no sacrifices too great for removing this evil of untouchability.
('62', 430, 1, 13, 866758) And what could be a better and more sacred reminder for this meeting than the portrait of Mr. K. Madhavan Nair ?
('62', 430, 1, 14, 866871) I had the pleasure of knowing him long ago.
('62', 430, 1, 15, 866915) When I first visited Calicut I had the honour of being introduced to him but I must confess that I did not know him so intimately as I came to know him when he paid me a visit at Yeravda.
('62', 430, 1, 16, 867103) I then came into very intimate touch with him, and when Mr. C. Rajagopalachariar was here and the Guruvayur referendum was going on, naturally I was corresponding with him as with other friends almost from day to day.
('62', 430, 1, 17, 867321) Then Smt.
('62', 430, 1, 18, 867331) Urmila Devi and my wife came into close contact with Mr. K. Madhavan Nair.
('62', 430, 1, 19, 867406) My wife is a simple woman.
('62', 430, 1, 20, 867433) She knows nothing, she does not know the English language, certainly she does not know Malayalam, but she was able to tell me in her very simple language
('62', 431, 0, 1, 867587) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 432
('62', 431, 1, 2, 867629) that she was very much struck by the simplicity of his character.
('62', 431, 1, 3, 867695) She merely strengthened the impression that Mr. Madhavan had left on my mind and that impression is still indelible.
('62', 431, 1, 4, 867812) I have the most vivid re collection of my contact with him and what struck me most was his transparent humility.
('62', 431, 1, 5, 867925) This is his faithful picture and I congratulate the artist on presenting the citizens of Calicut with this picture.
('62', 431, 1, 6, 868041) I think there you can easily see humility written in his features.
('62', 431, 1, 7, 868108) I dont think that the artist has enhanced the transparence of his humility.
('62', 431, 1, 8, 868184) I think the artist is incapable of doing that.
('62', 431, 1, 9, 868231) To look at Mr. Madhavan Nair and look at the living eye would give you a better illustration of that humility.
('62', 431, 1, 10, 868342) The whole of his behaviour is on the picture.
('62', 431, 1, 11, 868388) Mr. Madhavan Nair is in front of me today as I saw him in Yeravda.
('62', 431, 1, 12, 868455) He stands vividly before me and this is the one peculiar impression that he left on me.
('62', 431, 1, 13, 868543) I discovered also that he was a man of very few words.
('62', 431, 1, 14, 868598) You do not find many people who are economical in the use of language or their words.
('62', 431, 1, 15, 868684) In his contact with me Mr. Madhavan Nair showed this quality in a supreme degree.
('62', 431, 1, 16, 868766) His letters were compact, nice, neat and the briefest possible.
('62', 431, 1, 17, 868830) Whatever he had to say he expressed in a few words and he had finished.
('62', 431, 1, 18, 868902) That was the man.
('62', 431, 1, 19, 868920) If you were to recall the men who had died in body but are even now still living, you will discover that they are living not because of their intellectual gifts but because of virtues which you and I and every one of us can cultivate if we have the will and if we will make the necessary effort in order to cultivate them.
('62', 431, 1, 20, 869243) Therefore I would say you will be doing wrong to the memory of the man whom I have described as I have known him, if you think that you have performed your duty by calling upon me to unveil his portrait and for having witnessed this ceremony and having heard a few words in praise of his memory; nay, you will be doing wrong.
('62', 431, 1, 21, 869569) But you will be doing the right thing if you will treasure as a perpetual reminder to you that you also would like to be if not wholly at last some what like Mr. Madhavan Nair.
('62', 431, 1, 22, 869746) At the end, to put a finishing touch, Mr. Madhavan Nair died in harness so far as the Harijan cause is concerned.
('62', 431, 1, 23, 869860) He was a true co worker in the Harijan cause which is a matter of self purification, repentance and reparation.
('62', 431, 1, 24, 869972) I give you my evidence that Mr. Madhavan Nair, when he took up this cause, had the spirit in him, for every act that he did in connection with the Harijan cause was an act of sacrifice, repentance and reparation.
('62', 431, 1, 25, 870185) There was no meanness about anything that he did.
('62', 431, 1, 26, 870235) May his memory ever remain in my heart and in your own hearts.
('62', 431, 1, 27, 870298) I thank you once more for having presented me with addresses.
('62', 431, 1, 28, 870360) Since I think that this is not proper time for auctioning these
('62', 432, 0, 1, 870424) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 433
('62', 432, 1, 2, 870471) addresses, I hope that tomorrow you will help me to realize some money from these addresses because I know that Calicut will not send me away with disappointment.

('62', 432, 4, 5, 870705) January, 13, 1934 It was a great joy to me when I received the invitation to come to you to receive a purse for the Harijan cause and to speak a few words to you.
('62', 432, 4, 6, 870868) You have naturally expressed your sympathy with the cause.
('62', 432, 4, 7, 870927) But you boys ought not to be satisfied with the certificate that your Principal has given to the institution and therefore by implication to you also.
('62', 432, 4, 8, 871078) 2 You are called upon to do something much more vital, to regard untouchability not as an institution descended to us from Divinity but as an institution which has been devised by the devil himself for encompassing our undoing.
('62', 432, 4, 9, 871306) We, all of us, no matter to what faith we may belong, are children of the same Creator.
('62', 432, 4, 10, 871394) There is but one Creator.
('62', 432, 4, 11, 871420) We do say that with our lips, but we deny that profession in every walk of life and in so many of our activities.
('62', 432, 4, 12, 871534) That lie we ought to get rid of from our lives.
('62', 432, 4, 13, 871582) And who can do this better than the students?
('62', 432, 4, 14, 871628) You must therefore make the announcement fearlessly that if we are children of the same God, then we are all equal.
('62', 432, 4, 15, 871744) Do not in your mind cross examine and say, How can we be equal ? Some of you are very bright boys, and have received prizes and occupy front ranks in the classes, and how can those who are at the top of the class be on a par with those who are at the bottom of the class ?
('62', 432, 4, 16, 872017) This is a fine conundrum for you and me and you ought to solve it wisely and not unwisely.
('62', 432, 4, 17, 872108) Very often we solve these puzzles as we solve puzzles in arithmetic and geometry.
('62', 432, 4, 18, 872190) If you are able to solve
('62', 432, 5, 19, 872215) 1 Gandhiji then unveiled the portrait of K. Madhavan Nair.
('62', 432, 5, 20, 872274) Later during the day Gandhiji visited the office of the Mathrubhumi, a Malayalam daily, and addressing its staff described Mr. Madhavan Nair as the soul of the Trust due to whose ceaseless effort the paper occupied its unique place.
('62', 432, 5, 21, 872507) It was not too much to say that it had occupied a unique place in Malabar.
('62', 432, 5, 22, 872582) He appealed to the staff to follow in the steps of the late Mr. Madhavan Nair, who was whole heartedly in favour of the Harijan movement, without mental reservations or anything of the kind.
('62', 432, 5, 23, 872773) Pure and simple, it was a religious movement.
('62', 432, 5, 24, 872819) 2 The principal of the college had observed that Harijan boys in the institution were treated on a par with others.
('62', 433, 0, 1, 872935) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 434
('62', 433, 1, 2, 872977) these wisely, then I will give you illustrations of earthly parents.
('62', 433, 1, 3, 873046) Those of you who have brothers will realize that all have not the same degree of intelligence and of virtues.
('62', 433, 1, 4, 873156) You are not certainly of the same age.
('62', 433, 1, 5, 873195) You do not enjoy the same vigorous constitution.
('62', 433, 1, 6, 873244) And yet do you find your parents distinguishing between you and those who are brighter and more diligent ?
('62', 433, 1, 7, 873351) On the contrary perhaps your parents will give more to those who are helpless and are in need of help than to those who are brighter and well able to take care of themselves.
('62', 433, 1, 8, 873526) Do you suppose then that the Divine Father, the Father of all fathers that the world has ever seen, will treat some from their very birth to be untouchables and therefore the lowest and others to be the highest at the top of ladder ?
('62', 433, 1, 9, 873760) I suppose this is a self proved proposition of untouchability as you are practising it today.
('62', 433, 1, 10, 873854) The purse will be turned to good account if it is given as an earnest of your determination to change your hearts and to regard no person as untouchable on the face of the earth.
('62', 433, 1, 11, 874033) Religion teaches us to consider ourselves as the lowest and everybody else as the highest.
('62', 433, 1, 12, 874124) Do all of you behave like that ?
('62', 433, 1, 13, 874157) Untouchability has undoubtedly to go.
('62', 433, 1, 14, 874195) It is eating into the very vitals of our being and it crushes the very soul.
('62', 433, 1, 15, 874272) If you are able to understand my words then you will so change your hearts and transform them that you will not allow untouchability in any shape or form to find a residence in your hearts.
('62', 433, 1, 16, 874462) You will not allow untouchability towards boys belonging to other religions.
('62', 433, 1, 17, 874539) You will go to Harijan quarters, instead of wasting your time, you will go there, serve the Harijan boys, and find out what their wants are.
('62', 433, 1, 18, 874680) If your parents give you five pies or whatever it is, you must at least spare a portion of that money for the Harijan boys who are in greater need than yourselves.
('62', 433, 1, 19, 874844) You will give your leisure minutes for the service of Harijan boys and girls.
('62', 433, 1, 20, 874922) You will go to their quarters and sweep them.
('62', 433, 1, 21, 874968) You must teach them how to lead a clean life.
('62', 433, 1, 22, 875014) It is not enough that you clean your body but you must clean your heart and soul.
('62', 433, 1, 23, 875096) The first thing to do, when you get up from bed, is to ask God to keep you clean in heart and body.
('62', 433, 1, 24, 875196) If you will do these things, the purse that you have given is a token of your determination to get rid of untouc hability.

('62', 434, 3, 4, 875431) BHAI GHANSHYAMDAS, Malkani has shown me your letter.
('62', 434, 3, 5, 875484) I have written frankly to Biharilal.
('62', 434, 3, 6, 875521) I send you a copy of my letter.
('62', 434, 3, 7, 875553) We have to be outspoken and firm in our dealings with him.
('62', 434, 3, 8, 875612) It does not seem possible in this tour to achieve all that can be accomplished in a walking tour.
('62', 434, 3, 9, 875710) But whatever has been achieved appears to be good enough.
('62', 434, 3, 10, 875768) Public opinion has undergone a great change but not much change is evident in the conduct.
('62', 434, 3, 11, 875859) Let us see what happens.
('62', 434, 3, 12, 875884) I can see only Gods hand in this work.
('62', 434, 3, 13, 875923) This is not a trite observation.
('62', 434, 3, 14, 875956) This task is beyond the power of one lone person or even of thousands.
('62', 434, 3, 15, 876027) Nothing more can be written or said on this subject.
('62', 434, 3, 16, 876080) It simply means that my faith in God is grow ing stronger than ever.
('62', 434, 3, 17, 876149) I am having a direct experience of the feeble ness of my own powers.
('62', 434, 3, 18, 876218) I hope you are maintaining good health.

('62', 434, 7, 22, 876382) January 14, 1934
('62', 434, 8, 23, 876399) FRIENDS, It was not a task to me but a real pleasure to be able to drive through this very beautiful tract of the country.
('62', 434, 8, 24, 876522) I have learnt a great deal of what lies at the back of the addresses to which you have just now listened.
('62', 434, 8, 25, 876628) The deceased Subbiah Goundan, it seems, has left by his will all the landed property 2 he ever possessed for the Harijan cause.
('62', 434, 8, 26, 876756) It is a rare gift and a rather rich gift.
('62', 434, 8, 27, 876798) A great burden rests upon the executors of the will and the Trustees in connection with this Trust.
('62', 434, 8, 28, 876898) They cannot make of this colony the success that the testator must have desired it to become, unless they devote themselves heart and soul to the scheme which has to be worked under this bequest.
('62', 434, 8, 29, 877094) Let me hope that the Trustees or the executors are worthy of the trust that has been reposed in them and that they will discharge the
('62', 434, 9, 30, 877228) 1 The meeting was held to mark the opening of Muthal Thirunelli Harijan Colony under the auspices of the Sahodara Sangham.
('62', 434, 9, 31, 877351) 2 Amounting to 165 acres of land
('62', 435, 0, 1, 877384) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 436
('62', 435, 1, 2, 877426) trust to the entire satisfaction of the public.
('62', 435, 1, 3, 877474) I deliberately say the public because the Trust becomes public property immediately it is devoted to public use.
('62', 435, 1, 4, 877587) It is under this hope and with this assurance that I gladly declare this colony open and wish it every success.
('62', 435, 1, 5, 877699) The materials for the experiment or realization of the scheme are in front of us all.
('62', 435, 1, 6, 877785) We have in front of us not one or two but many Harijan brothers.
('62', 435, 1, 7, 877850) All of us witnessed the music and the dance that they gave us.
('62', 435, 1, 8, 877913) It was not a matter of enjoyment or amusement for us but it ought to carry a deep lesson to us.
('62', 435, 1, 9, 878009) I suppose all of you realized as I did at once that there was no music about their instrument nor was there any charm about the dance.
('62', 435, 1, 10, 878144) But that was the only thing that they do in order to pass their idle hours.
('62', 435, 1, 11, 878220) The responsibility for the want of music about their instrument and about their dance lies not upon their shoulders but upon your shoulders and my shoulders.
('62', 435, 1, 12, 878378) We need not have gone into their dance or their music in order to understand their primitive nature.
('62', 435, 1, 13, 878479) Their appearance, their dishevelled hair and everything about their person is sufficient to tell us how criminally neglectful we have been to our kith and kin.
('62', 435, 1, 14, 878639) They wear the same loin cloth or the scarf from years end to years end, till it turns into rags.
('62', 435, 1, 15, 878736) They rarely bathe and when they do bathe, you may take it from me that it will not be in specially clean water.
('62', 435, 1, 16, 878848) Again the responsibility for this disgraceful state of affairs is yours and mine.
('62', 435, 1, 17, 878930) And if I had the management of this colony I tell you I would straightaway invite these people to live in the colony, give them decent pay and insist upon their taking regular baths and transform them into presentable human beings.
('62', 435, 1, 18, 879162) I suppose that is precisely what we would do, each one of us, if we discovered suddenly that nearby was our own blood brother residing in precisely the same savage condition that these brothers of ours are living in.
('62', 435, 1, 19, 879379) And if that happy state of things is brought about without any loss of time, you and Iwill have more than well spent our time here.
('62', 435, 1, 20, 879511) This addresss almost concludes with these words May your efforts be crowned with success. Well, I can only say that my efforts can never be crowned with success unless your efforts are also crowned with success.
('62', 435, 1, 21, 879723) For, my efforts merely consist in inviting all the savarna Hindus to change of heart by serving Harijans in every way possible.
('62', 435, 1, 22, 879851) Lastly I ask these Harijan brothers to respond to the call of self purification.

('62', 436, 1, 2, 880000) 462. SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, CALICUT 1
('62', 436, 2, 3, 880041) January 14, 1934
('62', 436, 3, 4, 880058) FRIENDS, I have just got several purses on behalf of the citizens of Calicut which amount to Rs. 4,388 5 9. On the principle that you may not look a gift horse in the mouth I must in all courtesy thank you for the gifts that you have given on behalf of the Harijan cause.
('62', 436, 3, 5, 880330) But as a self chosen or self appointed Harijan servant I must lodge my respectful protest against the leanness of the purses from the capital of Malabar.
('62', 436, 3, 6, 880484) You will be surprised to learn that Bangalore, not the capital of Mysore, but the second city in Mysore, not as big as Malabar, produced much more than you have given this evening.
('62', 436, 3, 7, 880665) And I am fully aware of the capacity of Calicut to give for the Harijan cause.
('62', 436, 3, 8, 880744) But nothing is lost yet.
('62', 436, 3, 9, 880769) You have got here many tempting things, and at the end of a few remarks that I want to make, it is open to you and perfectly possible for you to make up for the deficiency and what is today undoubtedly a lean purse can be turned by you into a fat purse.
('62', 436, 4, 10, 881023) As I have said from many a platform after entering Malabar, if there was a map of untouchability made for the whole of India, Malabar would be marked as the blackest spot in all the land; and as matters stand today, I suppose you will admit that you will have to plead guilty to the charge.
('62', 436, 4, 11, 881314) Then if you are convinced of the sin of Malabar, as confessedly you are convinced by the very fact of your giving me this purse, you will admit that Malabar has to make the greatest reparation in order to rid itself of the greatest sin.
('62', 436, 4, 12, 881551) It does not matter, and it ought not to matter, the least little bit that some of you who are monied men do not originally come from Malabar.
('62', 436, 4, 13, 881693) Those who make their livelihood or their fortunes in Malabar should realize that every pie they get is tainted with this sin.
('62', 436, 4, 14, 881819) Therefore, in the matter reparation and repentance, they stand exactly on the same footing as the original Malayalis.
('62', 436, 4, 15, 881937) This morning they took me to a most beautiful bit of Malabar; they took me up the hills with the most romantic scenery.
('62', 436, 4, 16, 882057) There I was taken to a village called Kalpetta, and I recalled a hymnI think it was composed by Bishop Heber.
('62', 436, 4, 17, 882167) But whether it was composed by him
('62', 436, 5, 18, 882202) 1 The meeting was held at the beach at 6 p.
('62', 436, 5, 19, 882246) and was attended by 15,000 people.
('62', 436, 5, 20, 882281) 2 This paragraph has been taken from The Hindu.

('62', 437, 1, 2, 882371) or some other bishop, this is the line that I single out from that hymn for your edification.
('62', 437, 1, 3, 882465) It is said that, as he was approaching this Western coast of India, involuntarily this line came to his lips, or to his pen : Every prospect pleases, man alone is vile. 1 I have no doubt that he had not this black spot of untouchability in his mind when he wrote this line.
('62', 437, 1, 4, 882739) The orthodox interpretation of this line is wholly different from the one that I put upon it.
('62', 437, 1, 5, 882833) But poets can never be confined even in cages of their own construction.
('62', 437, 1, 6, 882906) Poets write for eternity.
('62', 437, 1, 7, 882932) Their words are charged with a meaning of which they have no conception when they utter or write them.
('62', 437, 1, 8, 883035) Scented breezes come from plantations that Nature has designed for man in Malabar.
('62', 437, 1, 9, 883118) But through untouchability he has violated Nature and thus become vile.
('62', 437, 1, 10, 883190) We have endeavoured to disfigure Gods mightiest creation, namely, man.
('62', 437, 1, 11, 883261) The soul of man presents a beauty never to be surpassed by any ravishing beauty of vegetation.
('62', 437, 1, 12, 883356) But the so called savarna Hindus or the so called high class Hindus arrogated to themselves the right of suppr essing a portion of Hindu humanity.
('62', 437, 1, 13, 883503) They endeavoured, however, vainly, as we shall presently see in a few years, perhaps.
('62', 437, 1, 14, 883589) But man has left no stone unturned to suppress, in the name of Divinity itself, the soul of man by putting thousands outside the pale of society.
('62', 437, 1, 15, 883735) I will tell you what I saw today in Kalpetta in the midst of the ravishing beauty of vegetation.
('62', 437, 1, 16, 883832) I saw wild specimens of humanity, with a stinking odour.
('62', 437, 1, 17, 883889) Please do not say hastily that that is why they are untouchables.
('62', 437, 1, 18, 883955) I want you to think with me a little more deeply than possibly you are prepared to do and realize with me that for this indescribably painful scene you and I are responsible.
('62', 437, 1, 19, 884130) These very men, in an hours time, if you desire, can be transformed into beings cleanly and outwardly as respectable as you and I may be.
('62', 437, 1, 20, 884268) A little hot water, or soap, a little white khaddar, and you will immediately find that they are just as presentable as you and I are.
('62', 437, 1, 21, 884403) Internally, God alone can be the judge between them and us.
('62', 437, 1, 22, 884463) It is quite possible, in fact, in my opinion it is quite certain, that we are much more sinful or much viler than they can be.
('62', 437, 1, 23, 884590) Our slates are sullied with writings not particularly creditable to us.
('62', 437, 1, 24, 884662) Their slates have still to be written upon.
('62', 437, 1, 25, 884706) Are you now surprised that, when I saw these countrymen of ours, I involuntarily said in my mind to the poet, you were right in saying,
('62', 437, 2, 26, 884842) 1 The lines are : What though the spicy breezes Blow soft oer Ceylons isle, Though every prospect pleases, And only man is vile.
('62', 438, 0, 1, 884971) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 439
('62', 438, 1, 2, 885018) Every prospect pleases, man alone is vile. Now, put your hand upon your heart and tell me whether, if you gave up all your wealth and all sisters discarded every article of jewellery of which they are possessed, would it be a sufficient reparation for the injuries that you have been partners in inflicting on these countrymen of ours ?
('62', 438, 1, 3, 885355) I wish to suggest to you that you will be fit servants of Harijans when you have begun the act of reparation by discarding all your possessions for their sake.
('62', 438, 1, 4, 885515) But I know that is an ideal state of things, and I know also that, if I could possibly carry you along those ideal lines, then India would again be really a land of thirty crores of gods.
('62', 438, 1, 5, 885703) But I am labouring under no such delusion.
('62', 438, 1, 6, 885746) I consider myself a practical idealist.
('62', 438, 1, 7, 885786) I take from human nature what it yields and go my way.
('62', 438, 1, 8, 885841) My business is to present to you the realities of the situation, to stimulate your intelligence and your imagination, to touch your hearts and then leave you to do the very best that you can possibly do for a cause so noble and so sacred as that of the Harijans.
('62', 438, 1, 9, 886104) I would like you, lastly, to realize that if we, that so called savarna Hindus, failed in this elementary duty by the Harijans during this brief period of probation, Hinduism will be a thing of the past.
('62', 438, 1, 10, 886308) History teaches us that many a civilization, many a culture perished beyond redemption because of the inherent weakness of the represen tatives of those bygone civilizations.
('62', 438, 1, 11, 886483) Do not, therefore, run away with the belief that Hinduism will be an exception and escape the impen ding doom, if we, Hindus, prove unworthy representatives of the price less treasures that the rishis have left for us.

('62', 439, 2, 3, 887182) BHAI VALLABHBHAI, It is four in the afternoon just now.
('62', 439, 2, 4, 887238) Today is my weekly silence day.
('62', 439, 2, 5, 887270) I am writing this in Nagji Purushottams bungalow in Calicut.
('62', 439, 2, 6, 887331) Devdas and Lakshmi arrived today.
('62', 439, 2, 7, 887365) Thakkar Bapa and Shankerlal will arrive tomorrow.
('62', 439, 2, 8, 887415) I will see the Zamorin 1 tomorrow at 2.30 in the afternoon and then will leave for Trichur at five.
('62', 439, 2, 9, 887515) The question is whether Lakshmi should go to Delhi for her delivery or remain in Madras.
('62', 439, 2, 10, 887604) She and Devdas will see Raja in about two days.
('62', 439, 2, 11, 887652) They will come to a final decision after that.
('62', 439, 2, 12, 887699) Devdas has got the permission to go to Delhi, but I think he should spend about six months in Madras to gain experience.
('62', 439, 2, 13, 887820) Lakshmi would not like her delivery to take place in his absence and Raja would not like it in his.
('62', 439, 2, 14, 887920) Thus there is a problem within a problem.
('62', 439, 2, 15, 887962) Doesnt the meaning of life consist in solving even such seemingly trivial problems in the right manner ?
('62', 439, 2, 16, 888067) I have specially called Shankerlal here for a brief discussion regarding khadi.
('62', 439, 2, 17, 888147) I observe that perhaps needless expenditure is being incurred in our department.
('62', 439, 2, 18, 888228) I wish to place before him what I have observed.
('62', 439, 2, 19, 888277) I think we should stop the needless expenditure on sending khadi from one province to another.
('62', 439, 2, 20, 888372) I incline finally towards the practice followed in Anantpur.
('62', 439, 2, 21, 888433) The practice followed at Saoli seems good.
('62', 439, 2, 22, 888476) Krishnadas [Gandhi] and Jajuji are experts and they comple ment each other perfectly.
('62', 439, 2, 23, 888562) Krishnadas is acquitting himself very well.
('62', 439, 2, 24, 888606) Keshu is quiet.
('62', 439, 2, 25, 888622) Ramdas is discontented.
('62', 439, 2, 26, 888646) He also will become calm by and by.
('62', 439, 2, 27, 888682) Devdas visited Ba.
('62', 439, 2, 28, 888701) He is full of praise for her courage.
('62', 439, 2, 29, 888739) She is of course harassad a little.
('62', 439, 2, 30, 888775) But without harassment there would be no pleasure in being in jail.
('62', 439, 2, 31, 888843) I paid a visit to Guruvayur.
('62', 439, 2, 32, 888872) There is no resentment there at all.
('62', 439, 2, 33, 888909) It is true, though, that the Varanashrama Sangh had sent pahelwans 2
('62', 439, 3, 34, 888978) from North India to demonstrate with black flags and get beaten up a little.
('62', 439, 3, 35, 889055) Two of them had taken control of the dais.
('62', 439, 3, 36, 889098) They got hold of a man by his feet, whereupon the young men there asked them to get down.
('62', 439, 3, 37, 889188) An altercation and fighting followed.
('62', 439, 3, 38, 889226) The pahelwans got beaten up a little.
('62', 439, 3, 39, 889264) They are quite all right, but they did their play 
('62', 439, 4, 40, 889315) 1 Of Calicut, now Kozhikode 2 Professional wrestlers

('62', 440, 1, 2, 889415) acting cleverly.
('62', 440, 1, 3, 889432) I sent the two to a dispensary and started the meeting and went on with it as if nothing had happened.
('62', 440, 1, 4, 889535) 1 The crowds continue to be as big as ever.
('62', 440, 1, 5, 889579) Small and big contributions continue to come in.
('62', 440, 1, 6, 889628) Another Annapurna, named Kaumudi, came into the limelight.
('62', 440, 1, 7, 889687) She gave all her ornaments.
('62', 440, 1, 8, 889715) 2 Who can harm him whom Rama protects ? So we will live as He ordains, do His bidding and dance as He wills.
('62', 440, 1, 9, 889824) Two Hungarian women, mother and daughter, met me in Bangalore.
('62', 440, 1, 10, 889887) Both are expert painters.
('62', 440, 1, 11, 889913) They lead a simple life.
('62', 440, 1, 12, 889938) Just now they have dedicated themselves to the service of India.
('62', 440, 1, 13, 890003) Bhajan music fills them with ecstasy.
('62', 440, 1, 14, 890041) N. seems likely to go to America.
('62', 440, 1, 15, 890075) S. too may go.
('62', 440, 1, 16, 890090) I have not written much to you about their doings.
('62', 440, 1, 17, 890141) What could I write ?
('62', 440, 1, 18, 890162) Besides, I dont have the time either.
('62', 440, 1, 19, 890200) Amala is getting on fairly well.
('62', 440, 1, 20, 890233) A letter from Mani is enclosed.
('62', 440, 1, 21, 890265) I have written to Swami for slivers and the books.
('62', 440, 1, 22, 890316) Since the books will not be of the same size, I dont know whether he will be able to pack them together.
('62', 440, 1, 23, 890421) But Swami is resourceful and, if it is possible, he will manage to do that.
('62', 440, 1, 24, 890497) Dahyabhai had sent to me Manis letter to you.
('62', 440, 1, 25, 890543) If I go to Belgaum, I will surely try to meet both.
('62', 440, 1, 26, 890595) But my going there is not certain.
('62', 440, 1, 27, 890630) Write to Mani that one need not be with ones elders in order to serve them.
('62', 440, 1, 28, 890706) If one does their work, one serves them.
('62', 440, 1, 29, 890747) It is not wrong to wish to be near them.
('62', 440, 1, 30, 890788) On the contrary, it is natural to do so.
('62', 440, 1, 31, 890829) But there is no necessary connection between serving them and being near them.
('62', 440, 1, 32, 890908) Poor girl, she would be thinking that her letter must have been forwarded directly to you.
('62', 440, 1, 33, 890999) But you must have noticed that it had made a trip to Sabarmati for a dip in the river.
('62', 440, 1, 34, 891086) 3 It thus got moistened at for or five places.
('62', 440, 1, 35, 891133) This is of course no new experience to us.
('62', 440, 1, 36, 891176) But it is our resolveis it not ?to remain contented with whatever happens.
('62', 440, 1, 37, 891251) I have not been able to satisfy Gordhanbhai.
('62', 440, 1, 38, 891296) But he doesnt write to me now.
('62', 440, 1, 39, 891327) Towards him, too, I have done my duty as I saw it.
('62', 440, 1, 40, 891378) I have asked him to let me know the total sum received from Vithalbhai and also to send me the correspondence between them.
('62', 440, 1, 41, 891502) If I get it, I think I shall have to publish it.

('62', 441, 1, 3, 891912) Even if, however, he writes everything only to you and if I get every such letter, I shall be fully satisfied.
('62', 441, 1, 4, 892023) I want you yourself to guide him in this matter.
('62', 441, 1, 5, 892072) I take it that you will write about Ba.
('62', 441, 1, 6, 892112) I have already written to you about Lakshmi.
('62', 441, 1, 7, 892157) I am writing to Mridula and Nandubehn.
('62', 441, 1, 8, 892196) 1 Devdas went and looked up Brijkrishna.
('62', 441, 1, 9, 892237) He is quite well.
('62', 441, 1, 10, 892255) He has survived.
('62', 441, 1, 11, 892272) He needs rest, which he is taking.
('62', 441, 1, 12, 892307) It is certain that Raja will be released on 6th February.
('62', 441, 1, 13, 892365) You should learn not to go on thinking about things, whatever the cause.
('62', 441, 1, 14, 892438) For that, you should either memorize the Gita or learn Sanskrit or go on reciting the Ramadhun both in the straight and the reverse order.
('62', 441, 1, 15, 892577) I get no time at all for worrying, so you neednt advise me not to worry.

('62', 441, 6, 20, 892769) January 15, 1934
('62', 441, 7, 21, 892786) GANGABEHN, I did get news of you from time to time.
('62', 441, 7, 22, 892838) I deliberately refrained from writing to you.
('62', 441, 7, 23, 892884) As you were permitted to receive only one letter I thought you should be able to get other more important letters.
('62', 441, 7, 24, 892999) But, whether I write or not, I always remember all the women workers.
('62', 441, 7, 25, 893069) My message to all the women is this : Irrespective of the resolution or promise made or given at the time of the march 2 to Ras, let all the women think again independently and take a fresh decision.
('62', 441, 7, 26, 893269) I will accept it.
('62', 441, 7, 27, 893287) I adhere to my previous view.
('62', 441, 7, 28, 893317) Nobody should persuade anybody else to adopt a particular course.
('62', 441, 7, 29, 893383) Everyone should decide for herself.
('62', 441, 7, 30, 893419) It is their religious duty to do so.
('62', 441, 7, 31, 893456) Each should act according to her capacity and her inclination.
('62', 441, 7, 32, 893519) It is an accident that I am out of prison.
('62', 441, 7, 33, 893562) No one should stay in the Red Bungalow.

('62', 442, 1, 6, 894157) Why should you be unhappy about it ?
('62', 442, 1, 7, 894194) However, things have not yet reached that stage.
('62', 442, 1, 8, 894243) It will indeed be good if they do.
('62', 442, 1, 9, 894278) It will be a real test for us.
('62', 442, 1, 10, 894309) Every one of the women should not expect a separate letter from me for the present, but I expect them all to write to me.
('62', 442, 1, 11, 894431) You should, of course, write for all.
('62', 442, 1, 12, 894469) And you should pour out whatever is in your heart.
('62', 442, 1, 13, 894520) If you need anybodys help for writing the letter, you may take it.
('62', 442, 1, 14, 894587) Everyone should tell me in her letter what work she has been doing.

('62', 443, 13, 15, 895931) MRIDU, It is of course too much to expect a letter from you.
('62', 443, 13, 16, 895992) When all of you consider me someone to be pitied, how can I expect any letter?
('62', 443, 13, 17, 896071) I think it is only due to his attitude that there is no acknowledgement of the letter I had written to Saralabehn.
('62', 443, 13, 18, 896186) I keep getting some new at least about all of you.
('62', 443, 13, 19, 896237) I am writing this letter to pass on Manis message.
('62', 443, 13, 20, 896288) She has received Rs. 30 from you.
('62', 443, 13, 21, 896322) She has received Rs. 25 from Nandubehn 1. Hence she does not at all need any more money.
('62', 443, 13, 22, 896411) She has written many other things.
('62', 443, 13, 23, 896446) But it only implies that she is at peace and her health is good.
('62', 443, 13, 24, 896511) There are fewer facilities this time.
('62', 443, 13, 25, 896549) There is no company at all.

('62', 443, 13, 28, 896681) You must be keeping yourself informed about me through the Harijan.

('62', 444, 7, 10, 897069) I must not attempt to write more Urdu.

('62', 444, 7, 15, 897239) I hope you got my letter in the jail.
('62', 444, 7, 16, 897277) I have told you that you should not come to me.
('62', 444, 7, 17, 897325) 2 I am far away from you.
('62', 444, 7, 18, 897351) But if you cannot resist the wish, you must come.
('62', 444, 7, 19, 897401) You should of course see your mother and Narandas.
('62', 444, 7, 20, 897452) In any case write to me fully.

('62', 445, 2, 3, 897719) [January 16, 1934] 2
('62', 445, 3, 4, 897740) Having travelled throughout Malabar I have no doubt that the removal of untouchability entirely rests with workers.
('62', 445, 3, 5, 897856) If they will prove their faith through character that is above reproach and through devotion that counts no sacrifice too great, the hearts of opponents will be melted.

('62', 445, 5, 8, 898105) BA, There is no letter from you probably because Devdas visited you.
('62', 445, 5, 9, 898174) But I hope you received my letter.
('62', 445, 5, 10, 898209) I have been writing every week regularly and also sending the discourses.
('62', 445, 5, 11, 898283) 3 Devdas came and saw me.
('62', 445, 5, 12, 898309) He arrived yesterday.
('62', 445, 5, 13, 898331) Lakshmi also has come.
('62', 445, 5, 14, 898354) Both are well.
('62', 445, 5, 15, 898369) We shall part today.
('62', 445, 5, 16, 898390) I think they will both go to Delhi after meeting Rajaji.
('62', 445, 5, 17, 898447) But it is not finally decided.
('62', 445, 5, 18, 898478) Devdas told me everything about you.
('62', 445, 5, 19, 898515) It is rather strange that they did not permit you to get oil for massage from outside.
('62', 445, 5, 20, 898602) But I was glad to learn from Devdas that you remain cheerful whether or not you get the oil or whether the food is good or bad.
('62', 445, 5, 21, 898730) If the reading of the Gita and other sacred books did not bear even this fruit, it is the same whether one had read them or not.
('62', 445, 5, 22, 898859) My discourse this time will therefore be about reading books.
('62', 445, 5, 23, 898921) We read in many works that reading of holy books by itself earns merit for one.
('62', 445, 5, 24, 899001) Such statements are intended to encourage us.
('62', 445, 5, 25, 899047) If we take them literally, we shall benefit nothing by reading them.
('62', 445, 5, 26, 899116) One should ponder deeply over what one reads.
('62', 445, 5, 27, 899162) Pondering deeply means thinking how we can apply their teaching in our life.
('62', 445, 5, 28, 899239) But today I have been having a large number of visitors and so I dont write more.
('62', 445, 5, 29, 899321) We are in Calicut today.

('62', 447, 1, 2, 900719) 475. SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, TRICHUR January 17, 1934
('62', 447, 2, 3, 900775) FRIENDS, It gives me very great pleasure to renew my acquaintance with you after so many years.
('62', 447, 2, 4, 900871) But that pleasure is not unmixed with pain because of the fact that in an enlightened State like Cochin untouchability is still flourishing.
('62', 447, 2, 5, 901012) It was perhaps whilst I was driving through the streets of Trichur this morning, to speak a few words to you, that I saw a Nayadi in flesh and blood.
('62', 447, 2, 6, 901162) He was shivering with fear.
('62', 447, 2, 7, 901190) It was a sign of humiliation for you, for me and for all Hindus.
('62', 447, 2, 8, 901255) It is high time that you wipe out that shame.
('62', 447, 2, 9, 901301) It is also a shame for us that there should be even at this stage menI dont know anything about womendefending untouchability, unapproachability and invisibility in the name of religion.
('62', 447, 2, 10, 901488) I venture to suggest to you that throughout the civilized world such a sin cannot possibly be hinted at in the name of religion.
('62', 447, 2, 11, 901617) His Highness the Maharaja by himself cannot possibly change your hearts, and I would be wholly wrong were I to go away with the belief that untouchability could be removed by a stroke of the pen.
('62', 447, 2, 12, 901813) Nor can this change be brought about by any sort of compulsion.
('62', 447, 2, 13, 901877) Therefore I would say to our sanatanists, or rather those who call themselves sanatanists, that they need not fear the propaganda that I am carrying on.
('62', 447, 2, 14, 902030) I have to appeal to your reason and to your hearts and urge you to do your best.
('62', 447, 2, 15, 902111) The Hindus claim to be essentially a nation of toleration.
('62', 447, 2, 16, 902170) And if there is such a thing as untouchability in Hinduism, it will become a religion of intolerance.
('62', 447, 2, 17, 902272) I therefore respectfully put to those who are today intending to do this propaganda against untouchability to wipe out this blot on Hinduism.
('62', 447, 2, 18, 902414) I have received several letters on this matter and most of the pricking letters that I have received on this problem are from Travancore and Cochin.
('62', 447, 2, 19, 902563) One word to reformers.
('62', 447, 2, 20, 902586) If we have sense of our own conviction, if we only understand the sanatanists, we should tolerate what our brethren may say of us.
('62', 447, 2, 21, 902717) After all it will depend upon the character of the reformers as to what is to be the nature of the reform that they are making.
('62', 447, 2, 22, 902845) The goal of this campaign against untouchability depends on the purity of the reformers in this campaign.
('62', 447, 2, 23, 902951) If they stick to their present character and ceaselessly endeavour in their task, then this monster of untouchability will be wiped out.
('62', 447, 2, 24, 903088) But patience is required
('62', 448, 0, 1, 903113) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 449
('62', 448, 1, 2, 903160) on the part of the reformers.
('62', 448, 1, 3, 903190) Surely, they must not lose faith though there is no support from the surroundings.
('62', 448, 1, 4, 903273) One word to Hindi friends.
('62', 448, 1, 5, 903300) I really expected that there would be so much atmosphere in Malabar about Hindi and so many Hindi scholars, that it would be easy for me to speak in Hindi altogether.
('62', 448, 1, 6, 903467) I was astonished, however, to find that there was no translator who would translate my Hindi speech, and there was so much disinclination on the part of the audience to allow a Hindi speech.
('62', 448, 1, 7, 903658) May I suggest to you that this disinclination also bars our way to progress in the campaign against untouchability?
('62', 448, 1, 8, 903774) I shall simply put it in one sentence.
('62', 448, 1, 9, 903813) There must be exchange of workers between North and South.
('62', 448, 1, 10, 903872) Though we have an inexhaustible supply of workers amongst the Hindi speaking people, if workers from the North cannot possibly come here and explain, it becomes an impossible barrier.
('62', 448, 1, 11, 904056) You may retort, what about you when you go to the North?
('62', 448, 1, 12, 904113) Why should not they understand our speech? If you will think a little deeper, you will realize that it is an impossible demand.
('62', 448, 1, 13, 904241) Among Malayalam, Telugu, Canarese, Tamil, what speech should the Northerner adopt?
('62', 448, 1, 14, 904324) I am myself a lover of all Indian languages.
('62', 448, 1, 15, 904369) And I have attempted at the age of sixty five to learn all these languages.
('62', 448, 1, 16, 904445) I have become a special lover of Southern languages.
('62', 448, 1, 17, 904498) But my intimate knowledge of this state of affairs demands that, if we are to work for such reform as [eradication of] untouchability, a common knowledge of Hindi is absolutely indispensable, because it is a language spoken by twenty crores out of thirty crores of people, and since we call ourselves Indians we can expect the thirty crores to try to understand the speech of twenty crores of people.

('62', 448, 3, 20, 904951) January 17, 1934 It is a matter of exceedingly great pleasure for me to renew your acquaintance.
('62', 448, 3, 21, 905048) The names Ezhavas and Thiyyas are not new to me at all, nor is the name of Shri Narayana Guru new to me.
('62', 448, 3, 22, 905153) I had the honour of meeting him and having long discussions with him while he was on this earth.
('62', 448, 3, 23, 905250) It was at that time I came in close contact with many Ezhavas and Thiyyas.
('62', 448, 3, 24, 905325) I met the leaders and had many friendly discussions with them.
('62', 448, 3, 25, 905388) 1 have very pleasant recollections of the
('62', 448, 4, 26, 905430) 1 This was in reply to the address of welcome by Thiyya Harijans.

('62', 449, 0, 1, 905563) 450 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('62', 449, 1, 2, 905605) affection I received from them without exception.
('62', 449, 1, 3, 905655) Since then constant correspondence has been kept up between them and myself.
('62', 449, 1, 4, 905732) Whilst some have differed from the view I have expressed, their affection has not suffered in any way.
('62', 449, 1, 5, 905835) I treasure that affection.
('62', 449, 1, 6, 905862) Therefore I am glad that I am once more in your midst.
('62', 449, 1, 7, 905917) I have carefully read the whole of your address.
('62', 449, 1, 8, 905966) All the remarks that you have made about the institution of caste, as you have interpreted it, have my fullest sympathy.
('62', 449, 1, 9, 906087) But you know from your experience that the vast majority of questions in this world have at least two sides.
('62', 449, 1, 10, 906196) They appear differently and bear different meanings also.
('62', 449, 1, 11, 906254) Caste, in so far as it is based on untouchability, is an institution of the devil, and we must get rid of it at any cost.
('62', 449, 1, 12, 906376) But I have explained repeatedly that caste expressed as varnadharma is an eternal law which we may not break except at our own risk.
('62', 449, 1, 13, 906509) There are many laws of Nature, which are still hidden from us.
('62', 449, 1, 14, 906572) That does not mean that they are not in existence or that they do not operate in our lives.
('62', 449, 1, 15, 906664) The law of varna was discovered by our ancestors ages ago; and, as I have understood and interpreted it, it has appeared to me a wholly beneficent law.
('62', 449, 1, 16, 906816) But like many laws and institutions of Nature this law of varna has been distorted, and we see it today in its hideous form.
('62', 449, 1, 17, 906941) ManHindu manhas disfigured it and made it doubly hideous by tainting it with untouchability.
('62', 449, 1, 18, 907034) Varnadharma is an economic law.
('62', 449, 1, 19, 907066) It is my certain conviction that, if the whole world followed that law, the strife that we see around us would cease at once.
('62', 449, 1, 20, 907192) It is pre eminently a law of concord, never of discord.
('62', 449, 1, 21, 907248) But I have not come here to give you a dissertation on the law of the varna.
('62', 449, 1, 22, 907325) I simply want to say that I am in full agreement with you in your fight against untouchability.
('62', 449, 1, 23, 907421) I entirely endorse your remarks that it has corrupted not Hindu society alone, but has affected other societies also.
('62', 449, 1, 24, 907539) The assumption of superiority of one class over another is a poison slowly killing us.
('62', 449, 1, 25, 907626) When Narayana Guru Swami enunciated his formula of one caste, one religion and one God, he had, in my opinion, no other meaning in his mind.
('62', 449, 1, 26, 907767) He said, I will not tolerate this assumption of superiority on the part of anybody. I do not recall in my many discussions with him that he had anything to say against the beneficent interpretation of varnadharma that I have given.
('62', 449, 1, 27, 907999) Let us not, therefore, destroy the tree for its bad or poisonous branches.
('62', 449, 1, 28, 908074) If you know anything whatsoever of gardening, you know that a gardener who finds diseased branches prunes them.
('62', 449, 1, 29, 908186) He deals with the whole tree if he finds the tree rotten at the root.
('62', 449, 1, 30, 908256) He will be considered a foolish gardener deserving summary dismissal who,
('62', 450, 0, 1, 908330) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 451
('62', 450, 1, 2, 908377) because he sees some diseased branches, lays the axe at the root.
('62', 450, 1, 3, 908443) In our society let us act as wise gardeners.
('62', 450, 1, 4, 908488) Let us understand the disease that is corroding Hinduism.
('62', 450, 1, 5, 908546) Let us get rid of untouchability or, in other words, of the evil of superiority and inferiority.
('62', 450, 1, 6, 908643) Let us first get rid of this evil and purify our hearts.
('62', 450, 1, 7, 908700) And when we shall have successfully done so, we shall be able to pronounce opinion on the working of the law of varna as I have explained it.
('62', 450, 1, 8, 908842) Today we know it chiefly as a species of untouchability.
('62', 450, 1, 9, 908899) Lastly, it is my conviction, and I want you to be infected with that conviction, that untouchability as I have described it to you is fast going.
('62', 450, 1, 10, 909045) And if you are fired by that conviction, I want you to put forth your best effort to exorcize that devil.

('62', 450, 2, 12, 909169) 477. SPEECH AT UNION CHRISTIAN COLLEGE, ALWAYE January 17, 1934 It is a matter of great pleasure to me to renew acquaintance with the students and professors of this college.
('62', 450, 2, 13, 909344) I have very pleasant recollections of my meeting with the students that were in the college at the time of my first visit.
('62', 450, 2, 14, 909467) It was good of you to think of me while I was passing through this part of the country.
('62', 450, 3, 15, 909555) My message is exceedingly simple.
('62', 450, 3, 16, 909589) It is no new truth that has dawned upon me today.
('62', 450, 3, 17, 909639) I have to the best of my ability striven to live up to it for the past fifty years.
('62', 450, 3, 18, 909723) And the more I have succeeded in living up to it, the greater has been my inward joy.
('62', 450, 3, 19, 909809) Nor is it for the first time that I am delivering this message to India.
('62', 450, 3, 20, 909882) But because of some incidents in the recent past, it comes to the people as a new thing.
('62', 450, 3, 21, 909971) My message is simply this that savarna Hindus, who have been considering themselves superior to those whom they have called untouchables, unapproachables, invisibles or avarna Hindus, should realize that this arrogation of superiority has no sanction whatsoever in the Shastras.
('62', 450, 3, 22, 910250) If I discovered that those scriptures, which are known as Vedas, Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, Smritis, etc., clearly showed that they claimed divine authority for untouchability as I have described it to you, then nothing on this earth would hold me to Hinduism.
('62', 450, 3, 23, 910511) I should throw it overboard as I should throw overboard a rotten apple.
('62', 450, 3, 24, 910583) My reason is offended and my heart is wounded at the
('62', 451, 0, 1, 910636) 452 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('62', 451, 1, 2, 910678) very thought that God Himself, who has created both savarna Hindus and avarna Hindus, should impose this bar sinister between His children.
('62', 451, 1, 3, 910818) The very thought that the rishis, who gave the Vedas and the Upanishads and who in every mantra that they pronounced taught the unity of God, could ever conceive of any such thing as untouchability as it is practised today in Hinduism must be repugnant to every intelligent person.
('62', 451, 1, 4, 911100) But prejudices and superstitions die hard.
('62', 451, 1, 5, 911143) They cloud the reason, befog the intellect and harden the heart.
('62', 451, 1, 6, 911208) And so you find learned men defending this untouchability.
('62', 451, 2, 7, 911267) But you, students, should know that behind this message there lurks also a much greater message.
('62', 451, 2, 8, 911364) This monster of untouchability has invaded every form of society in India; and the idea behind this message is that there should be not only no untouchability as between Hindus and Hindus, but that there should be no untouchability whatsoever between Hindus, Christians, Mussalmans, Parsis and the rest.
('62', 451, 2, 9, 911668) I am convinced that, if this great change of heart can be brought about among millions of savarna Hindus and their hearts can be purifiedas certainly they will be purifiedwe should live in India as people trusting each other and without any mutual distrust or suspicion.
('62', 451, 2, 10, 911939) It is untouchability with all its subtle forms that separates us from one another and makes life itself unlovely and difficult to live.
('62', 451, 3, 11, 912075) You can now, therefore, understand why I am drawing upon the sympathy of all Indians, to whatever faith they may belong.
('62', 451, 3, 12, 912196) Indeed I have not hesitated to ask the support of the whole world, not by way of pecuniary offering but by their sympathy, their prayers and their study of the question with all its implications.
('62', 451, 3, 13, 912392) I want their heart symp athy, which is infinitely greater than any pecuniary offering.
('62', 451, 3, 14, 912479) I do not stretch out my hand before them for money because they are not debtors to Harijans.
('62', 451, 3, 15, 912572) It is for savarna Hindus to discharge this debt.
('62', 451, 4, 16, 912621) To conclude, this prayerful support and sympathy can only be given by non Hindus, if they have no distrust of this movement and if they are satisfied that this is a movement of inward purification and deeply religious.
('62', 451, 4, 17, 912840) Remember that I have not idly given this message which has come straight from the heart.
('62', 451, 4, 18, 912929) I have gladly taken your purse which is a spontaneous offering from you.
('62', 451, 4, 19, 913002) But I have accepted it as a bond between you and myself and as a token of your
('62', 452, 0, 1, 913081) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1933 17 JANUARY, 1934 453
('62', 452, 1, 2, 913128) determination to give me the fullest support you are capable of giving.
('62', 452, 1, 3, 913200) And since I am a good accountant, I shall ask an account from you and shall want to know from time to time what part you have played in this movement.

('62', 452, 4, 6, 913413) [Before January 18, 1934] 2
('62', 452, 5, 7, 913441) DEAR FRIENDS,
('62', 452, 6, 8, 913455) It is altogether wrong and reprehensible for people to threaten to fast if I do not go to a particular place.
('62', 452, 6, 9, 913565) You can easily see that if many people issued such threats they can make it impossible for me to go anywhere.
('62', 452, 6, 10, 913675) I hope, therefore, that you will apologize and with draw your threat.
('62', 452, 7, 11, 913745) The Hindu, 18 1 1934
('62', 452, 8, 12, 913766) 1 Sundarraya Iyengar and other Harijan workers in a letter had informed Gandhiji of Iyengars intention to go on a fast from February 8, in case Gandhiji did not visit Kuppam during his forthcoming visit to Tiruppattur.

('62', 454, 22, 34, 915920) (B) CIRCULAR RE : CHANGE IN TOUR PROGRAMME
('62', 454, 23, 35, 915963) CAMP WARDHA, November 7, 1933
('62', 454, 24, 36, 915993) DEAR FRIEND,
('62', 454, 25, 37, 916006) RE: CHANGE IN GANDHIJIS PROGRAMME
('62', 454, 26, 38, 916040) It has been found necessary, quite unavoidable, to make a substantial alteration in
('62', 454, 27, 39, 916124) the order of the programme of Mahatmajis proposed tour, extending over 9 months November 1933 to July 1934. After touring in the Central Provinces, where the tour has commenced from today, and after attending the Central Board meeting at Delhi December 10 to 14he will go directly to Andhra, and the rest of the Madras Presidency, instead of going up to the Punjab, Sind, etc., and will thereafter work his way to Bengal and Assam and then westward.
('62', 454, 27, 40, 916574) The new order will, therefore, be as follows :
('62', 454, 28, 41, 916621) C. P., Delhi, Andhra, Madras City, Mysore States and Malabar District, Cochin
('62', 454, 29, 42, 916699) and Travancore, Tamil Nadu, Orissa, Calcutta, Bengal, Assam, Bihar, U.P., Punjab, Sind and Rajputana, Gujarat and Kathiawar, Bombay City, Maharashtra and Hyderabad Dn., and Karanataka at the end of July 1934.
('62', 455, 0, 1, 916908) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 456
('62', 455, 1, 2, 916950) The dates of the tour in the various provinces and other details are given in the
('62', 455, 2, 3, 917032) subjoined table.
('62', 455, 2, 4, 917049) The details of the tour in each province will be settled and filled up by the Provincial Secretaries in consultation with their Presidents in accordance with detailed instructions already issued.
('62', 455, 2, 5, 917245) But the four elementary rules to be observed are mentioned below :
('62', 455, 3, 6, 917312) (1)There should be full four hours cessation of public work for meals and
('62', 455, 4, 7, 917386) correspondence in the middle of the day, preferably from 10.0 a.m.
('62', 455, 4, 8, 917453) to 2.0 p.m.
('62', 455, 5, 9, 917465) (2)The days work should not begin earlier than 6.30 a.m.
('62', 455, 5, 10, 917522) and not [continue] later
('62', 455, 6, 11, 917547) than 8.0 p.m.
('62', 455, 7, 12, 917561) (3)Railway journey is any day preferable to motor journey, but where the latter is
('62', 455, 8, 13, 917644) unavoidable, it should not exceed 75 miles in one day.
('62', 455, 9, 14, 917699) (4)Mondays and Tuesdays in every week are nonworking days and should be
('62', 455, 10, 15, 917771) kept free of any travelling or public engagement.
('62', 455, 10, 16, 917821) To be accurate, the period from 8 p.m.
('62', 455, 10, 17, 917860) on Sunday to 8 p.m.
('62', 455, 10, 18, 917880) on Tuesday is reserved, 24 hours for silence and 24 hours for correspondence and other work.

('62', 455, 14, 22, 918044) (C) TOUR PROGRAMME PROVINCEWISE
('62', 455, 15, 23, 918076) THE PROGRAMME OF GANDHIJIS HARIJAN TOUR
('62', 455, 16, 24, 918116) Two days per week, preferably Monday and Tuesday, will be free from travelling
('62', 455, 17, 25, 918195) and appointments to give Gandhiji time for correspondence and writing for the Harijan.
('62', 455, 18, 26, 918282) Thus there will be five working days per week so far as the tour programme is concerned.

('62', 456, 20, 21, 919655) December 6, 1933
('62', 456, 21, 22, 919672) The offer made by the Aga Khan to Mr. Gandhi in London in 1931 still holds
('62', 456, 22, 23, 919747) If under Pandit Jawaharlals leadership, the Hindus and the Congress agree to the safeguards which the Muslims think necessary for their protection as an allIndia minority, the Muslim community will still be ready to serve as campfollowers of the majority community in Indias political struggle says Sir Mohammed Iqbal in a statement issued today referring to Pandit Jawaharlals charges against the communalist Muslim leaders.
('62', 456, 23, 24, 920173) Sir Mohammed Iqbal observes that the Aga Khan made a similar offer to Mr.
('62', 456, 24, 25, 920247) Gandhi in 1932 but Mr. Gandhi would not guarantee acceptance of his position by the Congress and also the Hindu and Sikh delegates did not endorse Mr. Gandhis position and further Mr. Gandhi wanted the Muslims not to support the untouchables claims.
('62', 456, 24, 26, 920497) After explaining the Muslim attitude towards nationalism and democracy, Sir Mohammed Iqbal puts the straight question to Pandit Jawaharlal, How is Indias problem to be solved if the majority community neither concedes the minimum necessary safeguards to the minority community, nor accepts a third partys award ?
('62', 456, 24, 27, 920810) The position can admit of two alternatives only.
('62', 456, 24, 28, 920859) Either, Indias majority community must accept for

('62', 457, 4, 5, 921330) EXTRACTS FROM JAWAHARLAL NEHRUS STATEMENT 1
('62', 457, 5, 6, 921374) I do not think that the Muslim communal organizations, chief of whom are the
('62', 457, 6, 7, 921451) Muslim AllParties Conference and the Muslim League, represent any large group of Muslims in India except in the sense that they exploit the prevailing communal sentiment.
('62', 457, 6, 8, 921622) But the fact remains that they claim to speak for Muslims, and no other organization has so far risen which can successfully challenge that claim.
('62', 457, 6, 9, 921769) Their aggressively communal character gives them a pull over the large number of nationalist Muslims who merge themselves in the Congress.
('62', 457, 6, 10, 921908) The leaders of these organizations are patently and intensely communal.
('62', 457, 6, 11, 921980) That, from the very nature of things, one can understand.
('62', 457, 7, 12, 922038) But it is equally obvious that most of them are definitely antinational and
('62', 457, 8, 13, 922114) political reactionaries of the worst kind.
('62', 457, 8, 14, 922157) Apparently they do not even look forward to any common nation developing in India.
('62', 457, 9, 15, 922240) At a meeting in the British House of Commons last year the Aga Khan, Sir
('62', 457, 10, 16, 922313) Mohammed Iqbal and Dr. Shafaat Ahmad Khan are reported (in The Statesman of December 31, 1932) to have laid stress on the inherent impossibility of securing any merger of Hindu and Moslem, political, or indeed, social, interests.
('62', 457, 10, 17, 922543) The speakers further pointed out the impracticability of ever governing India through anything but a British agency.
('62', 457, 10, 18, 922660) These statements leave no loophole for nationalism or for Indian freedom, now or even in the remote future.
('62', 457, 11, 19, 922768) I do not think that these statements represent the views of Muslims generally or
('62', 457, 12, 20, 922849) even of most of the communally inclined Muslims.
('62', 457, 12, 21, 922898) But they are undoubtedly the views of the dominant and politically clamorous group among the Muslims.
('62', 457, 12, 22, 923000) It is an insult to ones intelligence to link these views with those of nationalism and freedom, and of course any measure of real economic freedom is still further away from them.
('62', 457, 12, 23, 923180) Essentially, this is an attitude of pure reactionpolitical, cultural, national, social.
('62', 457, 12, 24, 923268) And it is not surprising that this should be so if one examines the membership of these organizations.
('62', 457, 12, 25, 923371) Most of the leading members are Government officials, exofficials, ministers, wouldbe ministers, knights and titleholders, big landlords, etc.
('62', 457, 12, 26, 923514) Their leader is the Aga Khan, the head of a wealthy religious group, who combines in himself, most remarkably, the feudal order and the politics and habits of the British ruling class, with which he has been intimately associated for many years.
('62', 457, 13, 27, 923760) Such being the leadership of the Muslims in India and at the Round Table
('62', 457, 14, 28, 923833) 1 Vide  Wanted a Manifestation of Christ in Daily Life , 30 3 1934
('62', 458, 0, 1, 923900) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1934 17 JANUARY, 1934 459
('62', 458, 1, 2, 923947) Conference it is no wonder that their attitude should be reactionary.
('62', 458, 1, 3, 924017) This reactionary policy went so far as to lead many of the Muslim delegates in London to seek an alliance with the most reactionary elements in British public lifeLord Lloyd and company.
('62', 458, 1, 4, 924204) And the final touch was given to it when Gandhiji offered personally to accept every single one of their communal demands, however illogical and exaggerated they might be, on condition that they assured him of their full support in the political struggle for independence.
('62', 458, 1, 5, 924477) That condition and offer were not accepted and it became clear that what stood in the way was not even communalism but political reaction.
('62', 458, 2, 6, 924616) Personally I think that it is generally possible to cooperate with communalists
('62', 458, 3, 7, 924696) provided the political objective is the same.
('62', 458, 3, 8, 924742) But between progress and reaction, between those who struggle for freedom and those who are content with servitude, and even wish to prolong it, there is no meeting ground.
('62', 458, 3, 9, 924915) And it is this political reaction which has stalked the land under cover of communalism and taken advantage of the fear of each community of the other.
('62', 458, 3, 10, 925067) It is the fear complex that we have to deal with in these communal problems.
('62', 458, 3, 11, 925144) Honest communalism is fear; false communalism is political reaction.
('62', 458, 4, 12, 925213) To some extent this fear is justified, or is at least understandable, in a minority
('62', 458, 5, 13, 925297) community.
('62', 458, 5, 14, 925308) We see this fear overshadowing the communal sky in India as a whole so far as Muslims are concerned; we see it as an equally potent force in the Punjab and Sind so far as the Hindus are concerned, and in the Punjab the Sikhs.
('62', 458, 6, 15, 925534) It was natural for the British Government to support and push on the reactionary
('62', 458, 7, 16, 925615) leaders of the Muslims and to try to ignore the nationalist ones.
('62', 458, 7, 17, 925681) It was also natural for
('62', 458, 8, 18, 925705) them to accede to most of their demands in order to strengthen their position in their own
('62', 458, 9, 19, 925796) community and weaken the national struggle.
('62', 458, 9, 20, 925840) A very little knowledge of history will
('62', 458, 10, 21, 925880) show that this has always been done by ruling powers.
('62', 458, 10, 22, 925934) The Muslim demands did not in
('62', 458, 11, 23, 925964) any way lessen the control of the British in India.
('62', 458, 11, 24, 926016) To some extent they helped the British
('62', 458, 12, 25, 926055) to add to their proposed special powers and to show to the world how necessary their
('62', 458, 13, 26, 926140) continued presence in India was.
('62', 458, 14, 27, 926173) I have written all this about the attitude of the Muslim communalist leaders not
('62', 458, 15, 28, 926254) only to complete the picture but because it is a necessary preliminary to the
('62', 458, 16, 29, 926332) understanding of the Hindu communal attitude.
('62', 458, 16, 30, 926378) There is no essential difference between
('62', 458, 17, 31, 926419) the two.
('62', 458, 17, 32, 926428) But there was this difference that the Congress drew into its ranks most of the
('62', 458, 18, 33, 926508) vital elements of Hindu society and it dominated the situation and thus circumstances did
('62', 458, 19, 34, 926598) not permit the Hindu communalists to play an important role in politics.
('62', 458, 19, 35, 926671) The Hindu
('62', 458, 20, 36, 926681) Mahasabha leaders largely confined themselves to criticizing the Congress.
('62', 458, 21, 37, 926756) however there was a lull in Congress activities, automatically the Hindu communalists
('62', 458, 22, 38, 926842) came more to the front and their attitude was frankly reactionary.
('62', 458, 23, 39, 926909) It must be remembered that the communalism of a majority community must of
('62', 459, 0, 1, 926984) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 460
('62', 459, 1, 2, 927026) necessity bear a closer resemblance to nationalism than the communalism of a minority group.
('62', 459, 1, 3, 927119) One of the best tests of its true nature is what relation it bears to the national struggle.
('62', 459, 1, 4, 927212) If it is politically reactionary or lays stress on communal problems rather than national ones, then it is obviously antinational.
('62', 459, 2, 5, 927343) I cannot hold the Mahasabha responsible for these statements 1 but as a matter of
('62', 459, 3, 6, 927425) fact they fit in with, and are only a slight elaboration of, the Mahasabha attitude.
('62', 459, 3, 7, 927510) And they bear out that many Hindu communalists are definitely thinking on the lines of co operation with British imperialism in the hope of getting favours.
('62', 459, 3, 8, 927667) It requires little argument to show that this attitude is not only narrowly communal but also antinational and intensely reactionary.
('62', 459, 4, 9, 927801) It is perfectly true that Hindu Mahasabha has stood for joint electorates right
('62', 459, 5, 10, 927881) through its career and this is obviously the only national solution of the problem.
('62', 459, 5, 11, 927965) It is also true that the Communal Award is an utter negation of nationalism and is meant to separate India into communal compartments and give strength to disruptive tendencies and thus to strengthen the hold of British imperialism.
('62', 459, 5, 12, 928198) But it must be borne in mind that nationalism cannot be accepted only when it profits the majority community.
('62', 459, 5, 13, 928308) The test comes in the provinces where there is a Muslim majority and in that test the Hindu Mahasabha has failed.
('62', 459, 6, 14, 928422) Nor is it enough to blame Muslim communalists.
('62', 459, 6, 15, 928469) It is easy enough to do so for
('62', 459, 7, 16, 928500) Indian Muslims as a whole are unhappily very backward and compare unfavourably with Muslims in all other countries.
('62', 459, 7, 17, 928616) The point is that a special responsibility does attach to the Hindus in India both because they are the majority community and because economically and educationally they are more advanced.
('62', 459, 7, 18, 928806) The Mahasabha, instead of discharging that responsibility, has acted in a manner which has undoubtedly increased the communalism of the Muslims and made them distrust the Hindus all the more.
('62', 459, 7, 19, 928998) The only way it has tried to meet their communalism is by its own variety of communalism.
('62', 459, 7, 20, 929088) One communalism does not end the other; each feeds on the other and both fatten.
('62', 459, 8, 21, 929169) I cannot say what following the Hindu or Muslim communal organizations have.
('62', 459, 9, 22, 929246) It is possible that in a moment of communal excitement each side may command the allegience of considerable numbers.
('62', 459, 9, 23, 929363) But I do submit that on both sides these organizations represent the rich upper class groups and the struggle for communal advantages is really an attempt of these groups to take as big a share of power and privilege for themselves as possible.
('62', 459, 9, 24, 929608) At the most, it means jobs for a few of our unemployed intellectuals.
('62', 459, 9, 25, 929678) How do these communal demands meet the needs of the masses ?
('62', 459, 9, 26, 929739) What is the programme of the Hindu Mahasabha or the Muslim League for the workers, the peasants and the lower middle classes, which form the great bulk of the nation ?
('62', 459, 9, 27, 929907) They have no programme except a negative one, as the Mahasabha hinted at Ajmer, of not disturbing the present social order.
('62', 459, 9, 28, 930031) This in itself shows that the controlling
('62', 459, 10, 29, 930073) 1 Made by Bhai Parmanand, Dr. Moonje and others
('62', 460, 0, 1, 930121) VOL. 62 : 8 OCTOBER, 1934 17 JANUARY, 1934 461
('62', 460, 1, 2, 930168) forces of these communal organizations are the upper class possessing social groups today.
('62', 460, 1, 3, 930259) The Muslim communalists tell us a great deal about the democracy of Islam but are afraid of democracy in practice; the Hindu communalists talk of nationalism and think in terms of a Hindu Nationalism.
('62', 460, 2, 4, 930460) Personally I an convinced that Nationalism can only come out of the ideological
('62', 460, 3, 5, 930540) fusion of Hindu, Muslim, Sikh and other groups in India.
('62', 460, 3, 6, 930597) That does not and need not
('62', 460, 4, 7, 930624) mean the extinction of any real culture of any group, but it does mean a common national
('62', 460, 5, 8, 930713) outlook, to which other matters are subordinated.
('62', 460, 5, 9, 930763) I do not think that HinduMuslim or other unity will come merely by reciting [it] 1 like a mantra.
('62', 460, 5, 10, 930861) That it will come I have no
('62', 460, 6, 11, 930889) doubt, but it will come from below, not above, for many of those above are too much
('62', 460, 7, 12, 930973) interested in British domination and hope to preserve their special privileges through it.
('62', 460, 8, 13, 931064) Social and economic forces will inevitably bring other problems to the front.
('62', 460, 8, 14, 931142) They will
('62', 460, 9, 15, 931152) create cleavages along different lines, but the communal cleavage will go.
('62', 460, 10, 16, 931227) I have been warned by friends, whose opinion I value, that my attitude towards
('62', 460, 11, 17, 931306) communal organizations will result in antagonizing many people against me.
('62', 460, 11, 18, 931381) That is
('62', 460, 12, 19, 931389) indeed probable.
('62', 460, 12, 20, 931406) I have no desire to antagonize any countryman of mine for we are in the
('62', 460, 13, 21, 931478) midst of a mighty struggle against a powerful opponent.
('62', 460, 13, 22, 931534) But that very struggle demands
('62', 460, 14, 23, 931565) that we must check harmful tendencies and always keep the goal before us.
('62', 460, 14, 24, 931639) I would be
('62', 460, 15, 25, 931650) false to myself, to my friends and comrades, so many of whom have sacrificed their all at
('62', 460, 16, 26, 931740) the altar of freedom and even to those who disapprove of what I say, if I remained a silent
('62', 460, 17, 27, 931832) witness to an attempt to weaken and check our great struggle for freedom.
('62', 460, 17, 28, 931906) Those, who, in
('62', 460, 18, 29, 931921) my opinion, are helping in this attempt may be perfectly honest in the beliefs they hold.
('62', 460, 18, 30, 932011) I do not challenge their bona fides.
('62', 460, 18, 31, 932048) But none the less, the beliefs may be wrong, anti
('62', 460, 19, 32, 932098) national and reactionary.
('62', 460, 20, 33, 932124) I write as an individual, and, in this matter, I claim to represent no one but myself.
('62', 460, 21, 34, 932211) Many may agree with me; I hope they do.
('62', 460, 21, 35, 932251) But whether they do so or do not, I must say
('62', 460, 22, 36, 932296) frankly what I have in my mind.
('62', 460, 22, 37, 932328) That is not perhaps the way of politicians, for, in
('62', 460, 23, 38, 932380) politics, people are very careful of what they say and do not say lest they offend some
('62', 460, 24, 39, 932468) group or individual and lose support.
('62', 460, 24, 40, 932506) But I am not a politician by choice; forces stronger
('62', 460, 25, 41, 932559) than me have driven me to this field and, it may be, that I have yet to learn the ways of
('62', 460, 26, 42, 932649) politicians.
