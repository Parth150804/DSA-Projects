('85', 0, 7, 11, 371) October 2, 1944
('85', 0, 8, 12, 387) When I approached him this morning and asked him whether he had any particular message to give to the country on this auspicious day, Gandhiji said: I am not accustomed to giving messages on such occasions.
('85', 0, 9, 13, 594) Gandhiji amidst laughter added: I want life for 125 years.
('85', 0, 9, 14, 653) But Malaviyaji cut it down by 25 years when he wired to me in Poona at Parnakuti that I must live for a hundred years.
('85', 0, 10, 15, 772) Bernard Shaws message arrived here today .
('85', 0, 10, 16, 815) that he would not send birthday messages to Gandhiji.
('85', 0, 10, 17, 869) Gandhiji laughed aloud and said: There you are.
('85', 0, 10, 18, 917) I did not know until a few years ago that I have a birthday.

('85', 1, 1, 2, 1039) 3. SPEECH AT KASTURBA MEMORIAL TRUST MEETING 1
('85', 1, 2, 3, 1086) SEVAGRAM, October 2, 1944 Gandhiji reminded them that the days gathering was not a public meeting.
('85', 1, 2, 4, 1185) There was an order prohibiting general meetings without previous Government permission throughout the Wardha district.
('85', 1, 2, 5, 1304) They all knew that he was a confirmed civil resister.
('85', 1, 2, 6, 1358) But this was not the occasion for civil disobedience.
('85', 1, 2, 7, 1412) Disobedience to be civil implies a certain procedure.
('85', 1, 2, 8, 1466) This was a meeting of the trustees and collectors of the Kasturba Gandhi National Memorial Fund for presentation of the collection.
('85', 1, 2, 9, 1598) Referring to the large number of people from Wardha and outside that had gathered there, he remarked that the reason for their presence on that occasion was that, for years, people all over India had got into the habit of celebrating his birthday according to both the Indian and the Christian calendar.
('85', 1, 2, 10, 1902) The intervening period between the two dates was also included in the observance.
('85', 1, 2, 11, 1984) This time, it had become known long before that he intended coming to Sevagram for receiving the purse on October 2. The Secretary, in his report, had told them how the idea of the Fund had originated.
('85', 1, 2, 12, 2186) They might like to know how he had come to be the President of the Trust.
('85', 1, 2, 13, 2260) The collections were started when he was in jail.
('85', 1, 2, 14, 2310) The trustees had asked for his consent to nominate him as their President.
('85', 1, 2, 15, 2385) After his accidental release 2, owing to illness, they were able to consult him and he had become President for the purpose of guiding the trustees as to how the money collected should be spent in a manner befitting the memory of the late Smt.
('85', 1, 2, 16, 2629) Kasturba.
('85', 1, 2, 17, 2639) The responsibility primarily rested on the trustees, but it rested on him most of all.
('85', 1, 2, 18, 2726) The money had to be spent in villages, which were not part of the cities.
('85', 1, 2, 19, 2800) The poorer and farther away from the cities, the better.
('85', 1, 2, 20, 2857) The Fund had to be spent for education and welfare of women and children only.
('85', 1, 2, 21, 2936) At first, the age limit for male children had been fixed at twelve years.
('85', 1, 2, 22, 3010) He himself had thought of raising it to sixteen.
('85', 1, 2, 23, 3059) But it was pointed out to him that in that case boys would get a disproportionate share, leaving the girls at a disadvantage and so their age limit was reduced to seven years.
('85', 1, 2, 24, 3235) As he had already remarked, the money was to be spent for education of women and children.
('85', 1, 2, 25, 3326) So long as he had any voice in the matter, the education would be of the basic education type.
('85', 1, 2, 26, 3421) The scope of basic education included the education of the entire society, beginning with the children and going up to adults and old men and women.
('85', 1, 2, 27, 3570) It had to be imparted through the practice of handicrafts, village sanitation and medical relief, preventive and curative, especially with regard to deficiency diseases.
('85', 1, 3, 28, 3740) 1 Gandhiji addressed the trustees and collectors of the Kasturba Gandhi National Memorial Fund in Hindustani.
('85', 1, 3, 29, 3850) On behalf of the trustees Sarojini Naidu presented him a purse of Rs. 80 lakhs, This report of the speech was issued to the Press by Pyarelal.
('85', 1, 3, 30, 3993) 2 On May 6, 1944
('85', 2, 0, 1, 4010) VOL.85 : 2 OCTOBER, 1944 3 MARCH, 1945 3
('85', 2, 1, 2, 4051) It was a tremendous work to carry out these reforms in the seven lakhs of Indias villages.
('85', 2, 1, 3, 4142) A sum of rupees seventy five lakhs or even of rupees one crore was a trifle, compared to the vastness of the task.
('85', 2, 1, 4, 4257) Seventy five per cent of the money collected from a particular area would be spent in that area, not being towns or cities, and the remaining twenty five per cent would go to the Central Fund.
('85', 2, 1, 5, 4450) But the money collected from big cities would all go to the Central Fund and nothing out of it would be spent in the cities.
('85', 2, 1, 6, 4575) In place of collection committees new committees would have to be formed to ensure proper spending of the money.
('85', 2, 1, 7, 4688) These committees might include some members of the collecting committees, but new names should be added.
('85', 2, 1, 8, 4793) If in any place ways and means of spending the money satisfactorily in accordance with the aims and objects of the Fund could not be found, the money would remain with the Central Fund.
('85', 2, 1, 9, 4979) On the other hand, if in any place suitable workers in adequate number could be found to carry out bigger plans satisfactorily, they would be given more money.
('85', 2, 2, 10, 5139) It was his wish that, as far as possible, money should be spent through the agency of women workers.
('85', 2, 2, 11, 5240) It was a matter of regret that women workers with suitable qualifications were not forthcoming in sufficient numbers.
('85', 2, 2, 12, 5358) The fault lay with the men who had kept the women enslaved in domestic drudgery.
('85', 2, 2, 13, 5439) They had to draw them out and push them to the fore.
('85', 2, 2, 14, 5492) After all men were not born efficient as a special creation.
('85', 2, 2, 15, 5553) It rested on them to produce more and efficient women workers.
('85', 2, 2, 16, 5616) Men, before they became efficient workers, were prone to make mistakes.
('85', 2, 2, 17, 5688) Therefore, they must not expect efficiency from women without giving them responsible work.
('85', 2, 2, 18, 5780) The Fund was collected in commemoration of an old illiterate village minded woman.
('85', 2, 2, 19, 5863) It would give peace to her departed soul if women, and especially old women, took a leading part in the execution of the object of the Memorial.
('85', 2, 2, 20, 6008) The collection had been made out of an overflow of enthusiasm and affection towards the memory of the departed soul.
('85', 2, 2, 21, 6125) He wanted them to see that it was spent in a way commensurate with that sentiment.
('85', 2, 2, 22, 6208) That was not a task merely for the twenty six trustees; hundreds of workers would be needed for it.
('85', 2, 2, 23, 6308) He had already said that to spend money properly was much more difficult than to collect it, unless they showed as much aptness in the former, as they had done in the latter.
('85', 2, 2, 24, 6483) So long as he was with them in the flesh, he would, of course, argue with them and fight with them, but it was for them to see that their work was so carried on as to give to the departed soul no cause for dissatisfaction.
('85', 2, 3, 25, 6706) The Hindu, 4 10 1944
('85', 2, 4, 26, 6727) 1 At one of the meetings of the Trust the question of Kasturbas outlook on life was raised during the discussion.
('85', 2, 4, 27, 6841) Gandhiji was reported to have said: Kasturbas outlook on life means the outlook represented by Kasturba Gandhi, not Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.

('85', 8, 7, 14, 13277) SEVAGRAM , October 7, 1944
('85', 8, 8, 15, 13304) DEAR JEHANGIRJI, In order that I may be understood by you as fully as possible I write this in English, though I should love to write to you in Gujarati.
('85', 8, 8, 16, 13458) For similar reason this will be typed.
('85', 8, 8, 17, 13497) Thank you for your cordial letter of greetings.
('85', 8, 8, 18, 13545) I would like you to make the cordiality concrete by attending the next meeting of the Trustees 1 to be held at Wardha on Saturday the 4th November.
('85', 8, 8, 19, 13693) Saturday has been specially chosen in order to enable the original Trustees to attend with minimum of inconvenience.
('85', 8, 8, 20, 13810) That you have already accepted the additional names proposed by me for the Board of Trustees and for the small Executive ought not to bear the meaning that the original trustees are to be sleeping members.

('85', 9, 0, 1, 14094) 10 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('85', 9, 1, 2, 14135) I know I am guilty of having given currency to the thought that the administration of trust funds should in practice be left to the Trustees of my choice.
('85', 9, 1, 3, 14290) I discovered my mistake before any mischief was done.
('85', 9, 1, 4, 14344) The more I think about it, the more I feel the narrowness underlying such a conception.
('85', 9, 1, 5, 14432) The whole board is a very happy combination and if most of the Trustees take an active interest in the administration of the Fund, we may expect even unthought of beneficial results.
('85', 9, 1, 6, 14615) An active combination and co operation of top city men and simple village minded men and women is not an everyday experience.
('85', 9, 1, 7, 14741) I trust therefore that you will make it convenient to attend the forthcoming meeting and even persuade the Trustees to do likewise, if indeed they need any persuading.

('85', 9, 5, 12, 15034) October 7, 1944
('85', 9, 6, 13, 15050) At the outset Jajuji read out the resolution submitted by Gandhiji before the workers of the A. I. S. A. in the September meeting.
('85', 9, 6, 14, 15181) There was a suggestion in that draft 2 that the A. I. V. I. A. and the Hindustani Talimi Sangh be also consulted while drawing the future plan of work of the A. I. S. A.
('85', 9, 7, 15, 15351) J. Should the Harijan Sevak Sangh, Goseva Sangh and Kasturba Trust be also included in this list?
('85', 9, 8, 16, 15449) G. Of course, inasmuch as they are as intimately connected with the programme of village reconstruction as the A. I. S. A., and have an economic background and outlook, not a political one.
('85', 9, 8, 17, 15639) The idea behind the merging of the Sanghs is only that of co orclinated service of the villages.
('85', 9, 8, 18, 15736) But the Kasturba Trust may well be kept out.
('85', 9, 9, 19, 15781) J. Keeping the Trust out would mean paralysing an organ of the united body.
('85', 9, 9, 20, 15857) Out of the six Sanghs we can easily form a united executive of one or more representatives from each Sangh.
('85', 9, 10, 21, 15965) 1 This and the subsequent discussions in Hindi with Shrikrishnadas Jaju, Secretary, All India Spinners Association, were reported by Swami Anand.
('85', 9, 10, 22, 16111) This translation is reproduced with alterations to bring it into conformity with the Hindi version appearing in Charkha Sanghka Navasamskaran.
('85', 9, 10, 23, 16254) 2 Vide Speech at A.I.S.A. Meeting II, 2 9 1944.
('85', 10, 0, 1, 16302) VOL.85 : 2 OCTOBER, 1944 3 MARCH, 1945 11
('85', 10, 1, 2, 16344) G. We can get our work done through the institutions of the Kasturba Trust, for their work is not anything different from village service.
('85', 10, 1, 3, 16483) Yet we should not include the Trust in it.
('85', 10, 1, 4, 16526) When I placed that resolution before the Charkha Sangh the Kasturba Trust was not in my mind.
('85', 10, 1, 5, 16620) I had only the A.I.V.I.A. and the Hindustani Talimi Sangh in view.
('85', 10, 1, 6, 16687) My idea was that the heads of these Sanghs should meet together and co ordinate their activities from the point of view of all round village service, and influence one another morally without any of them disturbing any of the others in its day to day work.
('85', 10, 1, 7, 16944) The only work of the Central Office of the A. I. S. A. should be to watch and give moral guidance.
('85', 10, 1, 8, 17043) It is quite possible that like Euclids point we might not be able to reach the ideal.
('85', 10, 1, 9, 17129) Decentra lization consists in bothering little about the practical details of the various centres but regulating the over all work on moral lines.
('85', 10, 1, 10, 17276) I know that I may not be able to get the Goseva Sangh, the Harijan Sevak Sangh and others to carry out this policy of decentralization.
('85', 10, 1, 11, 17412) But as service and total uplift of villages is the basis of all their activity I hope and trust the heads and workers of these Sanghs would of their own accord meet and think jointly how best to organize their work.
('85', 10, 1, 12, 17628) They would also have to consider, for example, why the work of the A. I. S.A. had to be arrested or modified.
('85', 10, 1, 13, 17738) One may argue that the work had not been arrested in any way.
('85', 10, 1, 14, 17800) The Sanghs work had expanded to cover 15,000 villages; 4_ crores of rupees had been distributed among the poor.
('85', 10, 1, 15, 17912) All this is no doubt true but we should not rest content with only this much.
('85', 10, 1, 16, 17990) Rather it should be a matter of regret for us that we have as yet accomplished only a hundredth part of our task.
('85', 10, 1, 17, 18104) A worker of the A. I. S. A. would hereafter not confine himself to khadi work alone but regard himself as well a representative of the A.I.V.I.A., the Goseva Sangh, etc., in the larger sense of the term.
('85', 10, 1, 18, 18308) And in so doing the worker should not feel that all this other work was beyond his sphere and that a new burden was being imposed upon him.
('85', 10, 1, 19, 18448) If he did so, it would mean that our policy and outlook were not really based on non violence.
('85', 10, 1, 20, 18543) Our worker should be able to identify himself with all that requires to be done in the village, that is, with the entire life of the village and yet feel as light as ever.
('85', 10, 2, 21, 18715) J. Like the A. I. S. A., should institutions such as the Goseva Sangh, the A. I. V. I. A. and the Hindustani Talimi Sangh also depute such workers to the villages?
('85', 11, 0, 1, 18879) 12 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('85', 11, 1, 2, 18920) G. Exactly so.
('85', 11, 1, 3, 18935) This is the real meaning of the merging of the Sanghs and of their having a united policy.
('85', 11, 1, 4, 19026) It does not mean any regimentation of work but it simply connotes working with the united moral strength of all and with a wholesome integrated outlook.
('85', 11, 2, 5, 19179) J. Will the A.I.S.A. have to run commercial and welfare departments separately?
('85', 11, 2, 6, 19259) I feel that to run all village activities with an all round outlook and to give general guidance to the workers will be the special function of the joint body of all the Sanghs.
('85', 11, 3, 7, 19437) G. I do not think so.
('85', 11, 3, 8, 19459) The joint body of the various Sanghs can once for all lay down administrative policies.
('85', 11, 3, 9, 19547) The arrangements so made must be honoured by all the Sanghs, which would greatly facilitate their managerial work.
('85', 11, 3, 10, 19662) My idea of the united body is that its work will expand like the mighty Krishna river, which starts as a tiny tickle of ten to twenty drops of water and ends as one vast Krishnasagar.
('85', 11, 3, 11, 19846) So also should flow the ceaseless stream of all sided work.
('85', 11, 3, 12, 19906) Such is my conception of the joint body.
('85', 11, 4, 13, 19947) J. The real problem is to obtain suitable workers.
('85', 11, 4, 14, 19998) You suggest various activities, but we cannot undertake them for want of workers.
('85', 11, 4, 15, 20080) Then again you insist that we should reach the seven lakhs of villages.
('85', 11, 5, 16, 20152) G. Of course, I do.
('85', 11, 5, 17, 20172) But when you fail I am there all along with you to share with you the blame.
('85', 11, 6, 18, 20249) J. So we are to take it that good workers are to be trained.
('85', 11, 6, 19, 20310) For the present we cannot hope to get thoroughly capable first grade workers.
('85', 11, 6, 20, 20388) We shall have to get on with second grade workers.
('85', 11, 6, 21, 20439) From among them we shall obtain first grade ones later.
('85', 11, 7, 22, 20495) G. Does the A.I.S.A. have about 2,000 workers?
('85', 11, 8, 23, 20542) J. About 3,000.
('85', 11, 9, 24, 20558) G. Well, then use them.
('85', 11, 9, 25, 20582) Place upon them the responsibility for this new type of work.
('85', 11, 9, 26, 20644) Also allow them greater freedom in their work.
('85', 11, 9, 27, 20691) We shall have to decentralize even at some risk.
('85', 11, 10, 28, 20740) J. I do not quite understand what you mean by decentralization.
('85', 11, 11, 29, 20804) G. We shall have to expand the work so that it covers every village.
('85', 11, 11, 30, 20873) This cannot be done by imposition from without.
('85', 11, 11, 31, 20921) The workers will have to be allowed to carry on the work themselves, more or less free of regulation by a central authority.
('85', 11, 11, 32, 21046) Were they to refuse to bear this much burden and wish to leave us we shall let them go ungrudgingly.
('85', 11, 11, 33, 21147) But we are not going to turn anybody out.
('85', 11, 11, 34, 21189) I like your idea of giving khadi cloth in exchange for hanks in Maharashtra.
('85', 11, 11, 35, 21266) This is not yet much in vogue.
('85', 11, 11, 36, 21297) But it is being done through workers already on our staff.
('85', 11, 11, 37, 21356) This is the way work will go on
('85', 12, 0, 1, 21388) VOL.85 : 2 OCTOBER, 1944 3 MARCH, 1945 13
('85', 12, 1, 2, 21430) and develop.
('85', 12, 1, 3, 21443) But workers who create obstructions will have to go.
('85', 12, 1, 4, 21496) I will have no hesitation in removing them.
('85', 12, 1, 5, 21540) If they disobey the policy of the A. I. S. A. they will have to quit.
('85', 12, 1, 6, 21610) And the Sangh is authorized to change its policy from time to time.
('85', 12, 1, 7, 21678) The plea of the workers that they were not aware of such changes will not be accepted.
('85', 12, 1, 8, 21765) Compulsory wearing of khadi, provident fund contributions, etc., were introduced in the course of the running of the Association and they were made applicable to all.
('85', 12, 1, 9, 21932) Those who could not accept them had to go.
('85', 12, 1, 10, 21975) Workers may leave us in this manner.
('85', 12, 1, 11, 22012) But we shall not remove them ourselves.
('85', 12, 1, 12, 22052) Nay, we shall require them to work along the new lines I have indicated.
('85', 12, 1, 13, 22125) On the other hand, we shall require those who would like to stay under our plan to work extensively on the new lines, others would naturally quit on their own.
('85', 12, 1, 14, 22285) Not for a moment did I think that we would have to disband the existing set of workers and start on a clean slate.
('85', 12, 1, 15, 22400) Suppose we have five workers at a centre and we feel that more work of various kinds can be carried out there, we shall ask them to take up manufacture of hand made paper and other village industries also, and if possible at the same time to produce more and more khadi and sell it in the neighbouring areas.
('85', 12, 1, 16, 22709) This is decentralization.

('85', 13, 2, 3, 23224) October 8, 1944
('85', 13, 3, 4, 23240) BHAI GANSHYAMDAS, I have talked to Sohanlalji 1 and to Devdas also.
('85', 13, 3, 5, 23308) I think that it should be easy enough to collect one lakh rupees towards a memorial for Mahadev.
('85', 13, 3, 6, 23405) So it doesnt seem proper to sell Sohanlaljis book 2 at higher than its market price for that purpose.
('85', 13, 3, 7, 23507) The book should be sold at its market price and on its own merit.
('85', 13, 3, 8, 23573) In this way the extent of public response to such a book may be ascertained.
('85', 13, 3, 9, 23650) The subject of Mahadevs memorial should be kept separate.
('85', 13, 3, 10, 23708) We shall talk about it when you come here.
('85', 13, 3, 11, 23751) Sohanlalji has agreed.
('85', 13, 3, 12, 23774) Devdas and Shriman have also accepted my point.
('85', 13, 3, 13, 23822) I understand, from what Devdas told me, that you feel some sort of a moral obligation [as you had agreed] that the book would be published for the Mahadev Memorial Fund.
('85', 13, 3, 14, 23992) In that case too it only means that one lakh rupees will be collected for that fund, isnt that so?
('85', 13, 3, 15, 24091) I fail to see any advantage in collecting it through the books when its impropriety is quite obvious to me.
('85', 13, 3, 16, 24199) A written order from you will be required for Parnerkars 33
('85', 13, 4, 17, 24259) appointment.
('85', 13, 4, 18, 24272) These days you hold all the authority.
('85', 13, 4, 19, 24311) The committee has been suspended.
('85', 13, 4, 20, 24345) If it is to be revived it will be done when we meet.
('85', 13, 4, 21, 24398) Lakshmanrao, who is the Secretary these days, needs your order; only then Parnerkar can take charge.
('85', 13, 4, 22, 24499) You must have read about my exploits in the newspapers.
('85', 13, 4, 23, 24555) More when we meet.
('85', 13, 4, 24, 24574) Your health must have improved in Mussoorie.

('85', 14, 2, 3, 24936) October 8, 1944
('85', 14, 3, 4, 24952) J. Please explain what should be the equipment and qualifications of workers.
('85', 14, 4, 5, 25030) G. For the present I shall not deal with other institutions but answer your question keeping in view the worker of the A. I. S. A. alone.
('85', 14, 4, 6, 25168) First, he should know, besides his mother tongue, the language of the province in which he is working as also the national language.
('85', 14, 4, 7, 25301) I do not feel that knowledge of English is essential.
('85', 14, 4, 8, 25355) He should know about the economic, social and political condition of the country and also something about the condition of the world.
('85', 14, 4, 9, 25489) This is rather difficult, it is true, but essential.
('85', 14, 4, 10, 25542) Unless he knows what is happening in other countries, their political set up, etc., how can he understand the relative conditions in India and where we are bound for?
('85', 14, 4, 11, 25709) He must have especially detailed knowledge of the conditions prevailing in and about his place of work.
('85', 14, 4, 12, 25813) So much in regard to his general preparation which is only a preliminary part of his equipment.
('85', 14, 4, 13, 25909) In regard to khadi, he should not only have thorough knowledge of the charkha, but he must also be well acquainted with the takli.
('85', 14, 4, 14, 26040) Spinning alone will not do.
('85', 14, 4, 15, 26068) He must know the entire science of khadi, i.e., evaluating the count, carding, identifying the variety of cotton, the kind of cotton required for a specific type of carding, spinning, etc.
('85', 14, 4, 16, 26257) He must be in touch with the history of improvements in technique, viz., how carding reached its present stage, the various improvements effected in the charkha.
('85', 14, 4, 17, 26419) He must also be able to repair and put the charkha in order.
('85', 14, 4, 18, 26480) It was in Yeravda that I systematically learnt spinning, repairing of the charkha, etc., and I had no one to help me either.
('85', 14, 4, 19, 26605) It means that the worker must know the elements of carpentry as well, for if he is not able to set right the damaged charkhas of the villagers, spinning will stop in the village and the cause will suffer.
('85', 14, 4, 20, 26810) I have dwelt upon the charkha so much because I regard it as the centre of village uplift.
('85', 14, 4, 21, 26901) In addition, the worker will have to see what other village crafts can prosper in his village.
('85', 14, 4, 22, 26996) The first in order among these crafts will be the bullock oil press.
('85', 14, 4, 23, 27065) Our worker would have to know its technique which has now been scientifically improved at Maganwadi under the supervision of Jhaverbhai Patel.
('85', 15, 0, 1, 27208) 16 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('85', 15, 1, 2, 27249) Another industry which may be introduced is hand made paper.
('85', 15, 1, 3, 27310) This has to be learnt not with the view of supplying paper to the whole country but in order to make the village self sufficient and capable of earning a little income.
('85', 15, 2, 4, 27479) J. If the work of hand made paper develops it will be like running a small factory.
('85', 15, 3, 5, 27563) G. I am only giving its outline.
('85', 15, 3, 6, 27596) Next to oil and hand made paper we must revive the handchakki (grinding stone)a vital thing in every village.
('85', 15, 3, 7, 27706) Otherwise flour mills which have been a source of anxiety to me for several years will be our fate.
('85', 15, 3, 8, 27806) Similarly in regard to rice.
('85', 15, 3, 9, 27835) Unless we inculcate among the villagers the habit of eating whole rice we shall not be able to solve the problem of food.
('85', 15, 3, 10, 27957) We must get our people in the villages to take to hand pounding of rice or handchakkis for husking paddy, for it is a well established fact that the white polished rice put out by mills and white sugar are harmful to health.
('85', 15, 3, 11, 28182) All the top experts are agreed upon it.
('85', 15, 3, 12, 28222) We do get enough literature on these subjects from America.
('85', 15, 3, 13, 28282) There brown, that is, yellow sugar has come in vogue.
('85', 15, 3, 14, 28336) So much so that traders sell the white polished sugar after colouring it with harmful colours.
('85', 15, 3, 15, 28431) Next take agriculture.
('85', 15, 3, 16, 28454) Our villagers depend on agriculture and cattle for ploughing.
('85', 15, 3, 17, 28516) I am rather ignorant in this respect for I have no personal experience.
('85', 15, 3, 18, 28588) But there is not a single village where we have no agriculture or cattle.
('85', 15, 3, 19, 28662) There is the buffalo, but except in Konkan and a few other places it is not much used for agriculture.
('85', 15, 3, 20, 28765) Even then it is not as if we have boycotted the buffalo.
('85', 15, 3, 21, 28822) Our worker will have to keep a careful eye on the cattle wealth of his village.
('85', 15, 3, 22, 28902) If we cannot use this wealth properly India is doomed to disaster and we also shall perish.
('85', 15, 3, 23, 28994) For these animals will then, as in the West, become an economic burden to us and we shall have no option before us save killing them.
('85', 15, 3, 24, 29128) Our worker, therefore, would have to acquire some knowledge at any rate about these things, and discover a non violent way of solving them.
('85', 15, 3, 25, 29268) Therein lies the solution to our problem of increasing population.
('85', 15, 3, 26, 29335) I do not know whether our non violent way will succeed or fail.
('85', 15, 3, 27, 29399) If it fails it will be our fault, not that of non violence.
('85', 15, 3, 28, 29459) It means that our sacrifice and efforts were insufficient.
('85', 15, 3, 29, 29518) Nevertheless all of us will have to make some effort.
('85', 15, 3, 30, 29572) Again, in the sphere of agriculture chaos reigns supreme.
('85', 15, 3, 31, 29630) In regard to agriculture, we must do our utmost to prevent further fragmentation of land, and to encourage people to take to co operative farming.
('85', 15, 3, 32, 29777) The village worker will fully examine
('85', 16, 0, 1, 29815) VOL.85 : 2 OCTOBER, 1944 3 MARCH, 1945 17
('85', 16, 1, 2, 29857) the circumstances prevailing in his village and induce the villagers to take up co operative farming.
('85', 16, 1, 3, 29959) Next to land is the question of water, not for agriculture but for drinking.
('85', 16, 1, 4, 30036) The worker will go and examine all the wells in the village.
('85', 16, 1, 5, 30097) It will be his duty to clean them both inside and around.
('85', 16, 1, 6, 30155) He will see how many wells of the village are fit for drinking water, whether the surroundings are clean, and whether there are any public urinals and latrines near them.
('85', 16, 1, 7, 30326) If they are near the wells, he will explain to the people the dangers involved in having them so near.
('85', 16, 1, 8, 30429) He will seek their co operation in having them removed to a distance.
('85', 16, 1, 9, 30499) He will thus attend to the cleanliness of the entire village.
('85', 16, 1, 10, 30561) Now we know about a workers field of activity.
('85', 16, 1, 11, 30608) He should have a thorough knowledge of village sanitation and efficient compost making.
('85', 16, 1, 12, 30696) He should convert this knowledge into practice.
('85', 16, 1, 13, 30744) Of course there will be division of work but it should not be like that of the railway porter showing the green signal or like the woman worker making soles in a leather factory.
('85', 16, 1, 14, 30923) Such people are incapable of doing any other work save their own.
('85', 16, 1, 15, 30989) This extreme division of work is degrading.
('85', 16, 1, 16, 31033) The village worker should acquire all round knowledge about building up the whole village.
('85', 16, 1, 17, 31124) There will be some sewing work in the village, smithy, carpentry, leather work, agriculture, etc.
('85', 16, 1, 18, 31222) The village worker should seek to bring about co operation among the workers in these various occupations so as to make them serve as harmonious parts of one whole and thus organize the villages.
('85', 16, 1, 19, 31418) All these activities appear to be too numerous but in fact they are not.
('85', 16, 1, 20, 31491) This should not be too difficult for a worker resolved to employ his body and mind fully.
('85', 16, 1, 21, 31581) Now for my last point.
('85', 16, 1, 22, 31604) If the worker going to the village has no faith in non violence, our work must fail.
('85', 16, 1, 23, 31689) If he concerns himself with economics alone and disregards ethics and morality, all our efforts are of no avail.
('85', 16, 1, 24, 31802) Non violence is the basis on which our work is to be built.
('85', 16, 1, 25, 31862) It will not do to ignore it.
('85', 16, 1, 26, 31891) In the initial stages people might achieve something even without it but ultimately the edifice of swaraj will not be raised without the foundation of ahimsa.
('85', 16, 1, 27, 32050) Workers must demonstrate non violence in everything they do.
('85', 16, 1, 28, 32111) They must be living embodiments of non violence.
('85', 16, 1, 29, 32160) If they cannot do this, their work will be but a showy nothing.
('85', 16, 1, 30, 32224) Our history is full of such instances.
('85', 16, 1, 31, 32263) Merely holding classes on non violence is of little use.
('85', 16, 2, 32, 32320) J. Would it not be better to have two workers instead of one in a village?
('85', 16, 2, 33, 32395) They could then divide the work between them and one could supplement the other.
('85', 17, 0, 1, 32476) 18 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('85', 17, 1, 2, 32517) G. Many people have asked me this question.
('85', 17, 1, 3, 32561) I am not going to lay down any definite rules in this regard.
('85', 17, 1, 4, 32623) I would prefer a worker to go alone.
('85', 17, 1, 5, 32660) He should tackle the situation single handed and become fearless in the process.
('85', 17, 1, 6, 32741) But if one is not enough you may send two.
('85', 17, 1, 7, 32784) We shall consider the position if lack of finances comes in the way.
('85', 17, 1, 8, 32853) But so far as I am concerned, I am prepared to go to the length of regarding one worker, if married, as two when both husband and wife serve in the village.
('85', 17, 2, 9, 33010) J. Experience often proves the contrary.
('85', 17, 2, 10, 33051) The wife of a worker is more a handicap to him than a support.
('85', 17, 3, 11, 33114) G. That is why I am not going to frame any rules or regulations about it.
('85', 17, 3, 12, 33188) Do you know that Rajaji insists on workers being married?
('85', 17, 4, 13, 33246) J. Some workers will be of higher calibre than others.
('85', 17, 4, 14, 33301) How do you like the idea of putting under one good worker five or six ordinary workers working in adjoining villages?
('85', 17, 5, 15, 33419) G. I have had talks about it with several friends.
('85', 17, 5, 16, 33470) It will not always be feasible.
('85', 17, 5, 17, 33502) I asked Timappa Naik to train a large number of workers as otherwise his work was likely to suffer.
('85', 17, 5, 18, 33602) He is a very capable and efficient worker of Karnataka.
('85', 17, 5, 19, 33658) He maintains himself on about six rupees.
('85', 17, 5, 20, 33700) He feels that only local workers could be trained at small expense.
('85', 17, 5, 21, 33768) He has trained such and they are working with him.
('85', 17, 6, 22, 33819) J. How much should we spend on a worker?
('85', 17, 7, 23, 33860) G. These are days of war made dearness.
('85', 17, 7, 24, 33900) I am afraid it may last for a fairly long time.
('85', 17, 7, 25, 33948) I am prepared to spend rupees fifty on a worker or even a hundred.
('85', 17, 8, 26, 34015) J. Besides food for the worker there is the burden of his family, of the education of his children, etc.
('85', 17, 9, 27, 34120) G. We shall take the middle way.
('85', 17, 9, 28, 34153) We shall leave out those with many burdens.
('85', 17, 9, 29, 34197) We shall confine ourselves to a family of four, husband, wife and two children, or at the most five.
('85', 17, 9, 30, 34298) I think it would be better not to take a bigger unit.
('85', 17, 10, 31, 34352) J. Many workers argue that they have the responsibility of maintaining their parents, brothers and sisters or other relatives.
('85', 17, 11, 32, 34479) G. We cannot take them.
('85', 17, 12, 33, 34503) J. While fixing the allowance of a worker, which was to be considered as of greater importance, his capacity or his family responsibilities?
('85', 17, 13, 34, 34644) G. To Vallabhswami I would give only five, not hundred.
('85', 17, 13, 35, 34700) But I would pay the maximum to one with a big family rather than let him go.
('85', 17, 13, 36, 34777) That is to say, both should live and neither should be envious of the other.
('85', 17, 13, 37, 34854) Nor should any entertain false hopes.
('85', 18, 0, 1, 34892) VOL.85 : 2 OCTOBER, 1944 3 MARCH, 1945 19
('85', 18, 1, 2, 34934) J. How much response should our workers expect from the villagers?
('85', 18, 1, 3, 35001) Would it be proper to impose some conditions on villages at the time of selection of our place of work?
('85', 18, 1, 4, 35105) The situation today is that workers who go to the villages are regarded as moneyed people and villagers think that they should extract from them as much benefit as possible.
('85', 18, 1, 5, 35279) Consequently the whole work is reduced to nought when the worker leaves the village after working for two years.
('85', 18, 2, 6, 35392) G. I think we should not impose any conditions.
('85', 18, 2, 7, 35440) For example, if we go and settle down for service among the aborigines, what terms can we lay down for them?
('85', 18, 2, 8, 35549) If we settle down and work resolutely in places where we have already gained some experience, our work will grow and prosper.
('85', 18, 2, 9, 35675) In the end everything depends on the worker himself.
('85', 18, 2, 10, 35728) If he wins the hearts of the villagers he will be able to get them to work with him.
('85', 18, 3, 11, 35813) J. How long may it take for a worker to become self sufficient?
('85', 18, 3, 12, 35877) Five years?
('85', 18, 4, 13, 35889) G. You yourself say five years.
('85', 18, 4, 14, 35921) The worker will go to the village with one months allowance in his pocket.
('85', 18, 4, 15, 35996) He will ask for a piece of land from the villagers and build his hut on it.
('85', 18, 4, 16, 36072) In case he obtains a vacant house he will occupy it.
('85', 18, 4, 17, 36125) Taking out the takli from his pocket he will sit under a tree and spin.
('85', 18, 4, 18, 36197) If the villagers have their spinning wheels he will repair them and spin along with them.
('85', 18, 4, 19, 36287) He will also gather the children of the village, play with them, tell them stories, teach them songs and do village cleaning.
('85', 18, 4, 20, 36413) Apart from his salary I am not going to give him a pie by way of capital to start an industry or anything else.
('85', 18, 4, 21, 36525) He will have to set up things by dint of his resourcefulness and love.
('85', 18, 4, 22, 36596) This will put to trial his passion for service and his ability.
('85', 18, 5, 23, 36660) J. It is a very hard test.
('85', 18, 6, 24, 36687) G. Yes.
('85', 18, 6, 25, 36695) We dont have to take up a sword, have we?
('85', 18, 6, 26, 36737) The way of love and service shown by me is the only way.
('85', 18, 6, 27, 36794) If we have to achieve swaraj by non violent means I have no other way.

('85', 20, 6, 18, 39319) You have to remember this much: 1. You should not rely upon me.
('85', 20, 6, 19, 39383) I may go to jail or I may die; or, I might not be able to get away from here.
('85', 20, 6, 20, 39461) If you do not have courage to undertake this experiment without me you had better not start on it.
('85', 20, 6, 21, 39560) 2. If you have the courage and self confidence you should find the required land.
('85', 20, 6, 22, 39642) 3. After securing the land you should prepare a blueprint indicating all the proposed arrangements.
('85', 20, 6, 23, 39742) The halls for treatment and experiment should be in the centre or in one corner.
('85', 20, 6, 24, 39823) They should be surrounded by decent huts for the residence of patients and children entrusted to our care.
('85', 20, 6, 25, 39930) The sanatorium should grow fruit, flowers, food grains and vegetables.
('85', 20, 6, 26, 40001) It should have cattle sheds and roads good enough for vehicles.
('85', 20, 6, 27, 40065) It should also have a gymnasium, a tank for bathing and other facilities.
('85', 20, 6, 28, 40139) All this cannot be built in a day.
('85', 20, 6, 29, 40174) But the entire project should be completed within five years.
('85', 20, 6, 30, 40236) Patients should be admitted right from the beginning.

('85', 24, 6, 13, 45352) 31. DISCUSSION WITH SHRIKRISHNADAS JAJU
('85', 24, 7, 14, 45392) October 10, 1944
('85', 24, 8, 15, 45409) J. How will the workers become self supporting?
('85', 24, 8, 16, 45457) Villagers can either give them money or grain, or give them employment.
('85', 24, 8, 17, 45529) Or they may run an industry and support the worker with a percentage of the profit.
('85', 24, 9, 18, 45613) G. Both courses may be adopted.
('85', 24, 9, 19, 45645) We shall surely pay the workers.
('85', 24, 9, 20, 45678) But apart from it the villagers or the worker himself can take up a craft for the sake of the village.
('85', 24, 9, 21, 45781) It may be possible for a good intelligent worker to work in the village and meet his own expenses as also those of his entire activities by his own intellectual work and take nothing from friends.
('85', 24, 9, 22, 45978) But earning money thus by the use of intellect alone is, as I have often said, a misuse of the intellect.
('85', 24, 9, 23, 46084) All such income must go to the country.
('85', 24, 10, 24, 46124) J. If our worker were to live on khadi production alone, it would not be possible for him to become self sufficient.
('85', 24, 10, 25, 46241) He would have to produce commercial khadi; and to earn profit, he must sell it, send it outside and do various other things.
('85', 24, 11, 26, 46366) G. This is not what I had visualized in my scheme.
('85', 24, 11, 27, 46417) I agree of course that if a village has to be made self supporting through the production of khadi alone, the surplus will have to be sent outside.
('85', 24, 11, 28, 46565) Once somebody explained that if we did not produce, in addition to self sufficient khadi, some amount of other khadi also, and our villagers had no other means of subsistence like land, etc., self sufficient khadi alone would not suffice to provide all their needs.
('85', 24, 11, 29, 46831) My idea of self sufficiency is that villages must be self sufficient in
('85', 25, 0, 1, 46903) 26 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('85', 25, 1, 2, 46944) regard to food, cloth and other basic necessities.
('85', 25, 1, 3, 46995) But even this can be overdone.
('85', 25, 1, 4, 47026) Therefore you must grasp my idea properly.
('85', 25, 1, 5, 47069) Self sufficiency does not mean narrowness.
('85', 25, 1, 6, 47112) To be self sufficient is not to be altogether self contained.
('85', 25, 1, 7, 47174) In no circumstances would we be able to produce all the things we need nor do we aim at doing so.
('85', 25, 1, 8, 47272) So though our aim is complete self sufficiency, we shall have to get from outside the village what we cannot produce in the village; we shall have to produce more of what we can in order thereby to obtain in exchange what we are unable to produce.
('85', 25, 1, 9, 47520) Only nothing of our extra produce would be sent to Bombay or far off cities.
('85', 25, 1, 10, 47597) Nor would we produce things with an eye to export to those cities.
('85', 25, 1, 11, 47664) That would run counter to my conception of swadeshi.
('85', 25, 1, 12, 47717) Swadeshi means serving my immediate neighbour rather than those far away.
('85', 25, 1, 13, 47791) Our outlook must be that we would serve the village first, then the neighbourhood, then the district and thereafter the province.
('85', 25, 1, 14, 47921) Working on these lines the A.I.S.A. must function only as the central protector of this policy.
('85', 25, 1, 15, 48017) We should not get involved in all sorts of complications.
('85', 25, 1, 16, 48075) We have three thousand workers and a large number of sales depots.
('85', 25, 1, 17, 48142) We shall not do away with them today.
('85', 25, 1, 18, 48180) But I am simply telling you of our new line of approach.
('85', 25, 2, 19, 48237) J. What should be the extent of a workers field of work?
('85', 25, 2, 20, 48294) Should it be an area of about five miles around his centre?
('85', 25, 3, 21, 48354) G. Yes, sometimes even less.
('85', 25, 3, 22, 48383) In Bengal and Bihar an area of five miles around the centre would cover many villages.
('85', 25, 4, 23, 48470) J. Why should we not define his field of activity as the area which he can cover if he left his centre in the morning, and returned to it after having a round by the evening?
('85', 25, 5, 24, 48645) G. Yes, we can do so.
('85', 25, 6, 25, 48667) J. Would the A.I.S.A. have to take up this work first?
('85', 25, 7, 26, 48722) G. Certainly, because the charkha is the sun round which other industries revolve like planets.
('85', 25, 7, 27, 48818) They would revolve rightly only when the suns movements are all right.
('85', 25, 7, 28, 48889) Today the village industries are behaving like comets.
('85', 25, 8, 29, 48944) J. The work against untouchability sometimes involves the worker in all kinds of difficulties.
('85', 25, 8, 30, 49039) How far may our worker entangle himself in them?
('85', 25, 9, 31, 49088) G. He should not involve himself in such troubles as would stop his work.
('85', 25, 9, 32, 49162) But there should be no place at all for untouchability in his personal life.
('85', 25, 9, 33, 49239) Our worker will draw water from the same well which the Harijans use.
('85', 25, 9, 34, 49309) He will clean up their wells and take all sanitary steps possible for proper drainage.
('85', 26, 0, 1, 49396) VOL.85 : 2 OCTOBER, 1944 3 MARCH, 1945 27
('85', 26, 1, 2, 49438) J. Then there is the political issue.
('85', 26, 1, 3, 49476) Suppose my self respect is wounded in the course of performance of my duties or my freedom is restricted, would it then be proper for me to offer civil disobedience?
('85', 26, 1, 4, 49642) It may be that I may keep aloof from other political disturbances, but in case of a general civil disobedience movement the worker cannot remain unconcerned.
('85', 26, 1, 5, 49800) What should he do under such circumstances?
('85', 26, 2, 6, 49844) G. General civil disobedience means a sort of anarchy in which everybody is a leader.
('85', 26, 2, 7, 49930) People start talking in terms of fighting.
('85', 26, 2, 8, 49973) But ordinarily we must follow the orders of the chief or the commander in charge of that movement.
('85', 26, 2, 9, 50072) Surely none can remain unconcerned in a movement of that nature.
('85', 26, 2, 10, 50137) Yet the worker would have to explain his position to the President of the A. I. S. A. who would give his opinion after taking all the pros and cons into consideration.
('85', 26, 2, 11, 50305) However, I am not thinking of general civil disobedience today.

('85', 27, 12, 19, 51687) October 11, 1944
('85', 27, 13, 20, 51704) J. I could not quite follow your views about decentralization.
('85', 27, 13, 21, 51767) Will you kindly throw more light on it?
('85', 27, 14, 22, 51807) G. My view is that we should let as many provinces as wish to be free to develop their work as they desire.
('85', 27, 14, 23, 51915) I would very much like them to take the entire responsibility on their own shoulders and recognize our authority only in the moral realm.
('85', 27, 14, 24, 52053) I would allow them to work with complete freedom if they follow my lines, are personally of sparkling character, and are prepared to take risk in honestly implementing our policy.
('85', 27, 14, 25, 52233) My only condition will be that they should sell all the khadi they produce in the villages near about the centre of production, the tehsil, the district or at the most the province.
('85', 28, 0, 1, 52415) VOL.85 : 2 OCTOBER, 1944 3 MARCH, 1945 29
('85', 28, 1, 2, 52457) should not, like the people of Chicacole, produce everything for Bombay and use nothing at home.
('85', 28, 2, 3, 52554) J. Chicacole is an exception, and is the only production centre in the country for fine khadi.
('85', 28, 3, 4, 52649) G. Yes, even in that case I would ask the producers and sellers to wear what they produce or sell.
('85', 28, 3, 5, 52748) They may send their articles outside but they must also wear them.
('85', 28, 3, 6, 52815) In case they go on producing fine khadi for Bombay but use only mill cloth themselves, their centre must cease to be run by the A. I. S. A. I would even insist that it be closed altogether.
('85', 28, 4, 7, 53005) J. Deducting something from the income of the craftsmen or women towards supply of khadi to them, we do make them wear some khadi.
('85', 28, 4, 8, 53136) But this seems to be a sort of imposition.
('85', 28, 4, 9, 53179) They do not take to it voluntarily.
('85', 28, 5, 10, 53215) G. I may put up with such a situation for a short period.
('85', 28, 5, 11, 53273) I do not expect people to take to khadi immediately and to accept non violence.
('85', 28, 5, 12, 53353) We must educate them in true economics and in non violence.
('85', 28, 5, 13, 53413) If we succeed in doveloping a true economic outlook in them, they would ultimately understand non violence as well.
('85', 28, 5, 14, 53529) An economics which runs counter to morality cannot be called true economics.
('85', 28, 5, 15, 53606) Our workers can develop an outlook of true economics in the villages only if they work under the inspiration of non violence and morality.
('85', 28, 5, 16, 53745) Their personal conduct should be of the purest nature and they should not be a party to any exploitation of the people.
('85', 28, 5, 17, 53865) If we try to cover India with khadi but ignore the miseries of the craftsmen, do not pay them living wages, do not share their weal and woe, or worry little if they are drunkards, it will not do at all.
('85', 28, 5, 18, 54068) It is better to burn all khadi to ashes than to pretend to work for the good of the country in this manner.
('85', 28, 5, 19, 54176) I would keep the drunkard and give him work, but I would befriend him and sweetly urge upon him daily to abstain from drink.
('85', 28, 5, 20, 54301) My aim is not to do the work of khadi only but to enter into the entire life of the villager.
('85', 28, 5, 21, 54395) I know that Chicacole khadi is very popular and that it fetches a good sale in far off provinces; but this pains me very much.
('85', 28, 5, 22, 54522) If we want to do khadi work successfully on the new lines in any province, district, taluk or village, we must not make one district lean on any other, or enter into competition with it.
('85', 28, 5, 23, 54709) All districts must meet their requirements themselves.
('85', 28, 5, 24, 54764) This would relieve us of our worries about sales.
('85', 28, 5, 25, 54814) It is quite possible that implementation of this new policy may
('85', 29, 0, 1, 54878) 30 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('85', 29, 1, 2, 54919) for the present reduce a centre to zero.
('85', 29, 1, 3, 54960) But later on the work is bound to progress.
('85', 29, 1, 4, 55004) Of course I cannot submit data and figures to prove what I say as I know nothing about them.
('85', 29, 1, 5, 55097) But you can of course supply them to me.
('85', 29, 1, 6, 55138) What I know, however, is that if khadi is to disseminate non violence, we shall have to follow this new policy, come what may.
('85', 29, 2, 7, 55265) J. Do you mean to say that the work of the A. I. S. A. will hereafter be entrusted to separate boards of trustees to be newly formed in each province?
('85', 29, 3, 8, 55416) G. I cannot say immediately what exactly would have to be done.
('85', 29, 3, 9, 55480) I know, however, that to promote decentralization such as I want, we would have to do away with the central control now dominating our every activity.
('85', 29, 3, 10, 55631) Today our machinery is top heavy.
('85', 29, 3, 11, 55665) Our approach and method being what they have been hitherto, this was inevitable.
('85', 29, 3, 12, 55746) It could have been avoided had I followed and insisted from the very beginning on our doing the right thing.
('85', 29, 3, 13, 55855) It is not that I was not aware that the work was not going on the right lines.
('85', 29, 3, 14, 55934) But I succumbed to the temptation of doing some work and let the work develop itself, resulting in the present centralization.
('85', 29, 4, 15, 56061) J. Yet we shall have to evolve some sort of constitution.
('85', 29, 4, 16, 56119) If the work of the provinces is to be entrusted to some body, registered societies with at least seven trustees for each would have to be set up.
('85', 29, 5, 17, 56265) If you allow me I shall soon bring about decentralization in sales.
('85', 29, 5, 18, 56333) Today khadi is such a profitable business and so full of opportunities for expansion that dealers and tradesmen are ready to take it up.
('85', 29, 5, 19, 56470) I am flooded with letters asking me for the transfer of one bhandar or the other.
('85', 29, 5, 20, 56552) But as a clear picture of the coming decentralization is not yet before my eyes I am not able to go ahead.
('85', 29, 5, 21, 56659) And even were we to entrust khadi work to some individual, trust or institution we shall have to insist on three things: (a) Purity of khadi, (b) Living wage and (c) Non profiteering.
('85', 29, 5, 22, 56843) If we are not able to control these three things the whole business will be reduced to a farce.
('85', 29, 5, 23, 56939) Whatever is to be done has to be done very carefully.
('85', 29, 5, 24, 56993) For example, take the case of the A. I. S. A. Every now and then we issue circulars to our branches to raise the wages and to impress upon the workers not to put the spinners to any difficulty whatsoever.
('85', 29, 5, 25, 57198) Nevertheless, our experience is that it is well nigh impossible to keep every worker of each centre in full control regarding such matters as accurate determination of the count of the yarn, correct payment of wages without adding or subtracting a pice or two here and there, and many little things of such nature.
('85', 29, 5, 26, 57513) And this happens even though our worker has no axe of his own to grind.
('85', 29, 5, 27, 57585) We appealed to purchasers of khadi to pay a higher price but those engaged in the craft did not receive an adequate wage.
('85', 29, 5, 28, 57707) This is as regards the conduct of workers and centres even when run under the direct supervision of the A. I. S. A. If however we introduce decentralization and the control slackens or is almost withdrawn, one cannot say what a fearful mess the certified dealers might not make of it.
('85', 29, 5, 29, 57992) Whether it is an individual or an
('85', 30, 0, 1, 58026) VOL.85 : 2 OCTOBER, 1944 3 MARCH, 1945 31
('85', 30, 1, 2, 58068) institution, there is acute rivalry among all those engaged in khadi work.
('85', 30, 1, 3, 58143) Even institutions indulge in a lot of profit making.
('85', 30, 1, 4, 58196) Under these circumstances if the A. I. S. A. keeps away from commercial sales, it would be a problem as to who should be entrusted with this responsibility or what sort of conditions or limitations should be imposed on them.
('85', 30, 1, 5, 58421) Again, if the provinces are to be left free to look after themselves, they do not have enough workers with the proper khadi outlook to be entrusted with the work.
('85', 30, 2, 6, 58584) G. Is there no way out of this difficulty?
('85', 30, 3, 7, 58627) J. The issue of provincial freedom will not be so difficult in some of the provinces, but it is bound to lead to complications in most of them.
('85', 30, 3, 8, 58771) For the present, I think, it would be wise to confine decentralization to the district, and not to extend it to the province.
('85', 30, 3, 9, 58897) The change should not be effected all at once.
('85', 30, 4, 10, 58944) G. For the present we may introduce decentralization in production only.
('85', 30, 4, 11, 59017) It should be binding on the producers to sell in their neighbourhood what they produce.
('85', 30, 4, 12, 59105) And it must be insisted that the central office should be consulted in case of distant sales.
('85', 30, 5, 13, 59199) J. What is the harm if we limit the sales area of a centre to its tehsil?
('85', 30, 6, 14, 59273) G. We may, but we must see that the producers or those who live in that village or in its neighbourhood wear the khadi produced.
('85', 30, 6, 15, 59402) We do of course recognize that khadi may be required to be produced for other places also.
('85', 30, 7, 16, 59493) J. We would ask workers to go to the centres that are well developed and to extend the work on the new lines as far as possible.
('85', 30, 7, 17, 59622) The A.I.S.A. will withdraw from those places where such workers take up work.
('85', 30, 7, 18, 59700) Thus decentralization will grow.
('85', 30, 7, 19, 59733) But one thing is important.
('85', 30, 7, 20, 59761) We shall ask the workers to sell khadi where they produce it, or in the tehsil or at the most in the district.
('85', 30, 7, 21, 59872) The A.I.S.A. will help in disposing of the surplus.
('85', 30, 7, 22, 59924) There is no loss in this work at present, as we know.
('85', 30, 7, 23, 59978) Today all the khadi that may be produced can easily be sold.
('85', 30, 7, 24, 60039) There is no worry as regards sales but only about transport.
('85', 30, 8, 25, 60100) G. Is the khadi sold in those centres where it is produced?
('85', 30, 9, 26, 60160) J. No, not even in the neighbourhood.
('85', 30, 9, 27, 60198) Today we have our bhandars in the headquarters of the district and sometimes at tehsils also.
('85', 30, 9, 28, 60292) We have also agents for taking khadi from the district bhandar and distributing it in other places in the district.
('85', 30, 9, 29, 60408) To those engaged in the craft we supply khadi after deducting two annas, four annas, or even eight annas in the rupee.
('85', 30, 9, 30, 60527) But apart from it, most of the khadi is sold in the cities.
('85', 30, 10, 31, 60587) G. As against this, I want the worker to go to his centre and produce only as much khadi as he can make the people there wear.
('85', 30, 10, 32, 60714) He must not produce for outsiders.
('85', 30, 10, 33, 60749) He should not rest content with training people in khadi production alone but should impart
('85', 31, 0, 1, 60841) 32 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('85', 31, 1, 2, 60882) instruction in other crafts also.
('85', 31, 1, 3, 60916) The earnings from these crafts will also go to the villagers and add to their meagre resources.
('85', 31, 1, 4, 61012) We shall take the unused or surplus khadi only if the villagers there tell us: We are producing khadi in a larger quantity than we can ourselves consume as we want cash for our other needs.
('85', 31, 1, 5, 61202) Please, therefore, buy our surplus khadi. It is quite possible that such villages as produce more khadi than they use will develop into centres of khadi production.
('85', 31, 1, 6, 61367) But I am not thinking now of them.
('85', 31, 1, 7, 61402) I have in mind only those villages where production of khadi will be carried on as a supplementary industry and so where the people will not depend for their living only on khadi but also on other industries.
('85', 31, 1, 8, 61611) That is how most of the villages will have to be organized.
('85', 31, 1, 9, 61671) This is decentralization in the true sense of the term.
('85', 31, 2, 10, 61727) J. Agriculture is the main occupation in the countryside.
('85', 31, 2, 11, 61785) The bullock oil press can also be run but it can provide a livelihood only to a few.
('85', 31, 2, 12, 61870) It is khadi alone that can in a large measure relieve unemployment among the poor.
('85', 31, 2, 13, 61953) But there is little scope for earning money through khadi produced for self sufficiency.
('85', 31, 2, 14, 62042) Should we desire to add a few pice to the coffers of the villagers, we shall have to encourage production of khadi for sale outside and we shall have to make arrangements for it.
('85', 31, 2, 15, 62221) Otherwise we cannot succeed in providing relief to those underemployed villagers who have work only for part of the year.
('85', 31, 3, 16, 62343) G. The trouble is that such khadi will continue to provide occupation to a few people only without spreading everywhere.
('85', 31, 4, 17, 62464) J. Spinning, I hope, will become universal.
('85', 31, 4, 18, 62508) Weaving of course will be a skilled craft carried on by a few as it is even today.
('85', 31, 4, 19, 62591) The fact is that so long as there are mills khadi production cannot be carried on on a large scale.
('85', 31, 4, 20, 62691) We began cloth self sufficiency work in Surgaon.
('85', 31, 4, 21, 62740) Ours was a five year programme.
('85', 31, 4, 22, 62772) Vallabhswamis experience is that people do take to khadi but not intelligently.
('85', 31, 4, 23, 62852) Once we withdraw from the centre, khadi also disappears.
('85', 31, 4, 24, 62909) Unless the people grasp the place of khadi in the entire economy of the village they will not stick to it.
('85', 31, 4, 25, 63016) The benefits derived from self sufficient khadi are so little that it offers hardly any attraction.
('85', 31, 5, 26, 63116) G. That also worries me.
('85', 31, 5, 27, 63141) Vallabhswamis words resound in my ears.
('85', 31, 5, 28, 63181) Party feeling developed in his village.
('85', 31, 5, 29, 63221) Fasting had to be resorted to.
('85', 31, 5, 30, 63252) I feel that behind it all there was a mistake in approach somewhere.
('85', 31, 5, 31, 63321) We offered inducements to the people, gave them facilities, but these do not serve our purpose.
('85', 31, 5, 32, 63417) We have to discover to what length khadi, by its own inherent strength, can carry India forward.
('85', 31, 5, 33, 63514) So far in our quest we have found that khadi is saleable in the cities but not in the villages.
('85', 31, 5, 34, 63610) We have not yet succeeded in making it acceptable to the villagers.
('85', 31, 5, 35, 63678) If we have been defeated we must confess our defeat.
('85', 31, 5, 36, 63731) We should learn from our past experience and adopt new methods of
('85', 32, 0, 1, 63797) VOL.85 : 2 OCTOBER, 1944 3 MARCH, 1945 33
('85', 32, 1, 2, 63839) work if needed.
('85', 32, 1, 3, 63855) That is why I say that we should stop producing khadi for the cities.
('85', 32, 1, 4, 63925) Today about a crore of rupees worth of khadi is sold in the cities.
('85', 32, 1, 5, 63993) We should hereafter make it clear to the cities that we cannot any more supply them ready made khadi but will teach them how to produce it, leaving them the option of either producing it themselves or getting it from the producer.
('85', 32, 1, 6, 64224) I am not enamoured of the sales of one crore of rupees worth of khadi in the cities.
('85', 32, 1, 7, 64309) We should put into khadi work not money but brain and heart.
('85', 32, 1, 8, 64370) In other words we shall now have ruthlessly to investigate the value of khadi in terms of its real potentialities.
('85', 32, 1, 9, 64485) In case we find it does not carry us as far as we claimed, let us give it up or lower our claim or let us take up some other basic occupation such as agriculture.
('85', 32, 1, 10, 64648) From the very beginning it has been my firm conviction that agriculture provides the only unfailing and perennial support to the people of this country.
('85', 32, 1, 11, 64801) We should take it up and see how far we can go with it as basis.
('85', 32, 1, 12, 64866) I would not at all mind if some of our young men serve the country by training themselves as experts in agriculture in place of khadi.
('85', 32, 1, 13, 65001) I have come to realize that we have yet to overcome a lot of difficulties.
('85', 32, 1, 14, 65076) The time has now come for us to pay attention to agriculture.
('85', 32, 1, 15, 65138) Till now I believed that improvement in agriculture was impossible unless we had the administration of the State in our own hands.
('85', 32, 1, 16, 65269) My views on this are now undergoing modification.
('85', 32, 1, 17, 65319) I feel that we can bring about improvements even under the present conditions, so that the cultivator may be able to make some income for himself from the land even after paying his taxes.
('85', 32, 1, 18, 65508) Jawaharlal says that any extra income to the peasant through the improvement of agriculture will be swallowed up under one pretext or the other by the alien Government.
('85', 32, 1, 19, 65677) But I feel that even if it were so, it should not hinder us from acquiring and spreading as much knowledge about agriculture as possible.
('85', 32, 1, 20, 65815) It may be that the Government will take away any additional income that may come to the villagers through improvements in agriculture.
('85', 32, 1, 21, 65950) If they do, we can protest and teach the people to resist and make it clear to the Government that it cannot loot us in this manner.
('85', 32, 1, 22, 66083) This is only by way of an illustration.
('85', 32, 1, 23, 66123) I therefore hold that we must hereafter find workers who will interest themselves in agriculture.
('85', 32, 2, 24, 66221) J. From the very beginning the question of agriculture as the main problem of the peasantry was before our eyes.
('85', 32, 2, 25, 66334) But we did not take it up because we thought it too difficult and also because we had to keep in view our own limitations.
('85', 32, 2, 26, 66457) Besides, in agriculture the peasant is today dependent on external factors altogether beyond his
('85', 33, 0, 1, 66554) 34 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('85', 33, 1, 2, 66595) control.
('85', 33, 1, 3, 66604) Supposing, for instance, we taught him better methods and he succeeded in producing more, his lot would still continue to be as bad as it always was if in the mean while the prices of cotton were reduced by half, a contingency which he can do nothing to prevent.
('85', 33, 1, 4, 66867) This is the terrible situation confronting him.
('85', 33, 2, 5, 66915) G. There is remedy for this also.
('85', 33, 2, 6, 66949) We did not train him on the right lines.
('85', 33, 2, 7, 66990) The capitalists induced him to sow commercial crops that would yield them money, so food crops became scarce.
('85', 33, 3, 8, 67100) J. This is inevitable where economics is subservient to the ruler or the capitalist.
('85', 33, 4, 9, 67185) G. The same is the condition in the field of cattle farming and dairying.
('85', 33, 4, 10, 67259) The cow and the bullock are intimately tied up with agriculture.
('85', 33, 4, 11, 67324) In this field also we have failed to play our part.
('85', 33, 4, 12, 67376) Therefore, our workers going to the villages will hereafter have to be alert and acquire the necessary knowledge to render effective service along all such lines.
('85', 33, 4, 13, 67539) God alone knows how far they would be able to accomplish all this.
('85', 33, 4, 14, 67606) But I have said what I had in my mind and what I thought fit.

('85', 34, 1, 8, 68502) How could you mistake all this for a reflection on you.
('85', 34, 1, 9, 68558) It shows what a sorry thing foreign speech is.
('85', 34, 1, 10, 68605) What is to be done?

('85', 36, 9, 23, 71536) 44. DISCUSSION WITH SHRIKRISHNADAS JAJU October 12, 1944
('85', 36, 10, 24, 71593) J. Before discussing the idea of decentralization further, I would like to place before you the present position of khadi work.
('85', 36, 10, 25, 71721) It will help us in our discourse.
('85', 36, 10, 26, 71755) Khadi work has been carried on along two lines:
('85', 36, 11, 27, 71803) (i) Production and sale of commercial khadi to the utmost extent.
('85', 36, 12, 28, 71869) (ii) Extending cloth self sufficiency as much as possible.
('85', 36, 12, 29, 71928) Today the A.I.S.A. is blamed for not discharging fully its responsibilities in both these respects.
('85', 36, 13, 30, 72028) G. May I interrupt?
('85', 36, 13, 31, 72048) Have we carried on sufficient research in regard to the self sufficiency programme to be able to prove that self sufficient khadi is cheaper than mill cloth?
('85', 36, 13, 32, 72206) In case we are not able to prove it, our villagers will not take to self sufficiency and the workers will have to face despair.
('85', 36, 13, 33, 72334) Now you may proceed.
('85', 37, 0, 1, 72355) 38 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('85', 37, 1, 2, 72396) J. There will be no cause for despair if we once grasp properly the limitations under which khadi work has to be carried on, whether it is commercial khadi or self sufficient khadi.
('85', 37, 1, 3, 72578) For instance, in spite of having made great progress as regards commercial khadi, it cannot be speeded up all of a sudden, for so long as there are textile mills khadi can develop only on public goodwill.
('85', 37, 1, 4, 72783) Besides, there are other difficulties.
('85', 37, 1, 5, 72822) Today, for instance, we produce one crore rupees worth of khadi.
('85', 37, 1, 6, 72887) Last year we discussed a scheme to increase it to five crores.
('85', 37, 1, 7, 72950) This meant that ignoring all other considerations, we had to make use of whatever workers were available, irrespective of their quality in order to push through our programme.
('85', 37, 1, 8, 73126) After careful calculation we reached the conclusion that even after our utmost efforts we shall not be able to produce more than one and a half times our maximum production, and that it would be quite impossible to increase production to two to four times.
('85', 37, 1, 9, 73383) Besides, there are other dangers in so recklessly increasing the work.
('85', 37, 1, 10, 73454) For then we shall have to recruit all sorts of workers who are neither conversant with khadi work nor observe truth and non violence.
('85', 37, 1, 11, 73588) This will not only injure the basic policy of the A.I.S.A. but also bring a bad name to it since the behaviour of the new workers may not always be becoming and clean.
('85', 37, 1, 12, 73756) I am, therefore, not in favour of developing work on such lines.
('85', 37, 2, 13, 73821) So also there are limitations in regard to cloth self sufficiency.
('85', 37, 2, 14, 73888) Even if the various processes from cotton cultivation to ginning, carding and spinning are carried out by the villagers in their own homes, weaving charges are so high that their net saving as compared with the price of mill cloth is very little, so little that the villager is not easily inclined to put himself to all the trouble involved.
('85', 37, 2, 15, 74230) Besides, mill cloth seems more attractive to him than khadi.
('85', 37, 3, 16, 74291) Moreover the reasons underlying our self sufficiency programme require to be explained to the villagers in a manner which will appeal to them.
('85', 37, 3, 17, 74434) They must see that only through working for self sufficiency the entire money of the village will remain in the village, that they can control the factors that make for their well being, that idle time will be profitably utilized and that the people of the village will become industrious.
('85', 37, 3, 18, 74724) In other words, self sufficiency khadi work can begin to have permanent effect only when carried out as part and parcel of the wider programme of non violent village uplift or village reconstruction.
('85', 37, 3, 19, 74924) A programme, which aims at making a certain number of villages self sufficient in cloth within a specific period, does not appeal to me.
('85', 37, 3, 20, 75061) We can succeed only to the extent to which we learn to work intelligently and with the backing of educated public opinion.
('85', 37, 3, 21, 75184) Work based on momentary sentiment or emotion does not endure.
('85', 37, 4, 22, 75246) The same is true about other village industries as well.
('85', 37, 4, 23, 75303) For the present the bullock oil press is running well in the countryside.
('85', 37, 4, 24, 75377) But there are serious misgivings as to whether it will continue always to do so.
('85', 37, 4, 25, 75458) The fact is that our village economic organization of which khadi, chakki and other village industries were the various main organs has collapsed.
('85', 37, 4, 26, 75605) Further, on account of mill competition, village made cloth, flour, rice, oil and everything else have become costlier.
('85', 37, 4, 27, 75725) Should we desire to reinstate them in their proper place, we should have to tackle the entire village economy and build it up anew.
('85', 37, 4, 28, 75857) Concentration and research on any single aspect will
('85', 38, 0, 1, 75910) VOL.85 : 2 OCTOBER, 1944 3 MARCH, 1945 39
('85', 38, 1, 2, 75952) be of little avail.
('85', 38, 1, 3, 75972) Inertia has seized our people.
('85', 38, 1, 4, 76003) Progress cannot be by leaps and bounds but very gradual.
('85', 38, 1, 5, 76060) The problem is very intricate indeed.
('85', 38, 2, 6, 76098) G. I would like to go even a step further.
('85', 38, 2, 7, 76141) I accept all that you say.
('85', 38, 2, 8, 76168) That is why for three days I opened my heart before the A.I.S.A, 1
('85', 38, 3, 9, 76235) and raised all these issues.
('85', 38, 3, 10, 76264) Now we have to do the work anew with the objective of all round village uplift.
('85', 38, 3, 11, 76344) Let us see how far we can go.
('85', 38, 3, 12, 76374) Even if our present activities have to be slackened or reduced to nought for some time on account of these changes, it does not matter.
('85', 38, 3, 13, 76510) We have created some sentiment about khadi among the people.
('85', 38, 3, 14, 76571) But if there is some error in what we told the people about the significance of khadi we must pause.
('85', 38, 3, 15, 76672) If ours was a wrong claim we must declare our error openly and withdraw our claim.
('85', 38, 3, 16, 76755) I would ask city dwellers to produce their own khadi.
('85', 38, 3, 17, 76809) I would forgo the temptation to supply khadi to them.
('85', 38, 3, 18, 76863) We shall go and settle in the villages.
('85', 38, 3, 19, 76903) In case workers want to leave us on account of this change we shall let them go.
('85', 38, 3, 20, 76984) Unless our head and heart are converted to this extent we cannot achieve the desired result.
('85', 38, 3, 21, 77077) We of the A. I. S. A. will merely direct policy.
('85', 38, 3, 22, 77126) By decentralizing our work as much as possible we shall free ourselves from day to day khadi work completely.
('85', 38, 3, 23, 77236) Thereafter we shall concentrate our energy and attention on the other activities or crafts carried out in the vicinity of the village we settle in.
('85', 38, 3, 24, 77384) Only then will the real substance of our work be realized.
('85', 38, 3, 25, 77443) All these years I remained under the delusion that we had made good job of it in that we had put four and a half crores of rupees in the pockets of the poor.
('85', 38, 3, 26, 77601) I became anxious to increase it to sixty crores, and I claimed swaraj would be in our hands if we produced sixty crores worth of khadi in a year.
('85', 38, 3, 27, 77747) Had I persisted along that line, I might perhaps have succeeded.
('85', 38, 3, 28, 77812) But now I realize that even if I had succeeded what was done in a year might possibly have been undone in the next.
('85', 38, 3, 29, 77928) Today our main concern should be to lay the foundation for this work as deep as possible.
('85', 38, 4, 30, 78018) J. It means that the city workers should curtail their present work (which is mainly concerned with pushing up sales in the commercial way) and start selling khadi in lieu of yarn.
('85', 38, 4, 31, 78199) They should also participate in the programme for the revival of other village industries.
('85', 38, 5, 32, 78290) 1 Vide Speech at A. I. S. A. Meeting I, 1 9 1944 and Speech at A. I. S. A. Meeting III, 3 9 1944.
('85', 39, 0, 1, 78388) 40 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('85', 39, 1, 2, 78429) G. Exactly.
('85', 39, 1, 3, 78441) In case we do not do it we shall be betraying ourselves and the world.
('85', 39, 1, 4, 78512) Today we rejoice in having sold khadi worth several thousand rupees in one day in the Kalbadevi Bhandar at Bombay.
('85', 39, 2, 5, 78627) J. If we arrange to give khadi in lieu of yarn, and the A.I.S.A. does not do it, private dealers would come forward and say that they would willingly take up the work, asking us merely to give them certificates.
('85', 39, 2, 6, 78839) If we agree to it we shall have to look into their accounts, their procedure, their work, etc., and we shall get engulfed in a maze of difficulties from which it would be hard to extricate ourselves.
('85', 39, 3, 7, 79039) G. Satis Babu says that we should give them freedom in this matter.
('85', 39, 4, 8, 79107) J. He holds that the entire production and sales work should be handed over to the people, and the A.I.S.A. should keep aloof.
('85', 39, 5, 9, 79234) G. It is essential for us to consider his proposal in detail.
('85', 39, 6, 10, 79296) J. In matters of money even good men have been found to have failed in resisting the temptations of earning extra profit .
('85', 39, 6, 11, 79419) Human nature being thus what it is, it is very dangerous to hand over khadi work to private persons.
('85', 39, 7, 12, 79520) G. I have my answer.
('85', 39, 7, 13, 79541) I do not know what exactly Satis Babus proposal means.
('85', 39, 7, 14, 79596) But in the picture before me there is no question of handing over khadi work to anybody.
('85', 39, 7, 15, 79685) We shall say only this much to city dwellers that if they want to put on khadi they cannot do so save according to the principle we have laid down.
('85', 39, 7, 16, 79833) It is not merely a principle of economics but also invariably of morals and ethics.
('85', 39, 7, 17, 79917) According to it everyone has to prepare his or her own khadi.
('85', 39, 7, 18, 79979) If there is no weaving arrangement in the city, weavers can be domiciled in the cities, or somewhere in the neighbourhood in colonies.
('85', 39, 7, 19, 80114) Weaving can be carried on there.
('85', 39, 7, 20, 80147) There need be no rivalry.
('85', 39, 7, 21, 80173) We shall explain to the city people that the khadi we are at present giving to them is of no use, as they are not able to know the extent of relief that the poor obtain thereby, and that therefore they should get khadi woven before their own eyes.
('85', 39, 7, 22, 80421) Thus we shall change our policy.
('85', 39, 7, 23, 80454) Today we ask the city people to take to khadi on the plea that it supports lakhs of people.
('85', 39, 7, 24, 80546) But this compels the A. I. S. A. to resort to trade and commerce.
('85', 39, 7, 25, 80612) Well, if the Sangh were to carry on commerce alone, it could easily support many people by doing so.
('85', 39, 7, 26, 80713) Hence we are not going to lend to khadi dealers the prestige of the A. I. S. A. We shall withdraw from that field of work so that the certificates will cease to have any meaning.
('85', 39, 7, 27, 80892) The only limitation that we shall observe is that if there is some extra khadi left over in a village or
('85', 40, 0, 1, 80997) VOL.85 : 2 OCTOBER, 1944 3 MARCH, 1945 41
('85', 40, 1, 2, 81039) locality after meeting the local need, and if that khadi is useful to the city people we shall permit it to be sold in the cities.
('85', 40, 1, 3, 81170) But the khadi should not be produced specially for export to the cities.
('85', 40, 1, 4, 81243) If this means a reduction in our work it matters little.
('85', 40, 1, 5, 81300) I am sure I am not providing true work relief to the people from the way in which I am doing khadi work today.
('85', 40, 1, 6, 81411) What I am doing is tempting them by the handsome wages of the A. I. S. A. This is not the way to make the work permanent.
('85', 40, 1, 7, 81533) If the poor want employment we must provide it.
('85', 40, 1, 8, 81581) But it must be in such a manner that they can secure earnings from their own neighbourhood instead of depending on distant cities .
('85', 40, 2, 9, 81713) J. I would like you to throw more light on this point.
('85', 40, 3, 10, 81768) G. Today we are not really able to help the villagers.
('85', 40, 3, 11, 81823) By offering the spinners three, four, six or eight annas I comfort myself with the belief that I have given them a livelihood.
('85', 40, 3, 12, 81950) But it amounts to nothing more than a dole, for the work that I am providing them is not of a permanent nature.
('85', 40, 3, 13, 82062) In case we get control of the State in our hands and by that means close all mills, it may perhaps then be possible to provide them permanent work.
('85', 40, 3, 14, 82210) But today I cannot hide from them the truth that I have been only trying to fill their idle hours.
('85', 40, 3, 15, 82309) If I have to provide them with some money I shall teach them other crafts also.
('85', 40, 3, 16, 82389) I shall fully acquaint them with the present economic situation and educate them in this regard.
('85', 40, 3, 17, 82486) No doubt I would wish to give work to every spinner who comes seeking it.
('85', 40, 3, 18, 82560) But I shall not send the khadi thus produced to Bombay.
('85', 40, 3, 19, 82616) I shall ask the workers to sell it in the neighbouring villages.
('85', 40, 3, 20, 82681) But this is not enough.
('85', 40, 3, 21, 82705) I must investigate what work other than spinning can be provided to them in the village.
('85', 40, 3, 22, 82794) Only by revising the entire economic life of the village can our work become permanent.
('85', 40, 3, 23, 82882) Whether for villagers or for us, I agree, cities will always have some sort of attraction.
('85', 40, 3, 24, 82973) Nevertheless we shall be free from our present day city life.
('85', 40, 3, 25, 83035) We shall show how in contrast to the cities more amenities can be provided in the villages.
('85', 40, 3, 26, 83127) But if we merely go on sending to Bombay the khadi produced in the village, this object can never be accomplished, however high a wage we may pay to the village spinners.
('85', 40, 3, 27, 83298) I allotted an hour every day for discussion with you because I believed that through such discussion my own thinking would be clarified.
('85', 40, 3, 28, 83435) I am convinced that we shall have to introduce fundamental changes in our mode of work.
('85', 40, 3, 29, 83523) If we are destined to fail we shall face it; we shall do so with full knowledge and alertness, not in our
('85', 41, 0, 1, 83629) 42 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('85', 41, 1, 2, 83670) ignorance or folly.
('85', 41, 1, 3, 83690) Even then If people laugh at me I shall bear it.
('85', 41, 1, 4, 83739) They might say: Gandhi wasted a crore of rupees.
('85', 41, 1, 5, 83788) But of course no one pocketed it. I need your help in deciding whether what I am saying is correct.
('85', 41, 1, 6, 83888) I would like to know your opinion.
('85', 41, 2, 7, 83923) J. When we send to the cities the khadi produced in the villages we provide immediate economic benefit to the villagers.
('85', 41, 2, 8, 84044) But if we stop doing so what else can we give them?
('85', 41, 3, 9, 84096) G. If I had my way I would say to those whom I have been supporting through khadi so far that they should get out of this rut and take to some other work.
('85', 41, 3, 10, 84251) We shall have to find other work for them, as we are doing in Sevagram where the majority of the population consists of Harijans.
('85', 41, 4, 11, 84381) J. The situation here in Sevagram is exceptional.
('85', 41, 4, 12, 84431) There are so many institutions here.
('85', 41, 4, 13, 84468) Guests are always coming in, new houses are under construction and various other activities are going on.
('85', 41, 4, 14, 84574) All this provides work to the people.
('85', 41, 5, 15, 84612) G. Everywhere I would try to create a similar situation.
('85', 41, 5, 16, 84669) We shall have to apply our mind and energy to discover new avenues of work.
('85', 41, 6, 17, 84745) J. What you say about agriculture, cattle breeding, etc., is perfectly correct.
('85', 41, 6, 18, 84825) But we should also consider how to provide permanent economic benefit to the villagers through khadi.
('85', 41, 6, 19, 84927) Had mill cloth not been there, it would have been easy.
('85', 41, 6, 20, 84983) But the question is what are we to do when we have the mills.
('85', 41, 7, 21, 85045) G. I would explain to the people that they could not get khadi like mill cloth.
('85', 41, 7, 22, 85125) I would try to bring it home to them that if khadi is dearer the extra money goes to the villager, his family and to the village, and that this provides security to the economy of the village.
('85', 41, 7, 23, 85318) I would explain to them the moral aspect as well.
('85', 41, 7, 24, 85368) Besides, I would teach them other methods of earning in the village.
('85', 41, 7, 25, 85437) I have now given up the idea that villagers can earn their living through doing khadi work alone.
('85', 41, 8, 26, 85535) J. It means that we have to set them to work by bringing home to them the moral and social value of khadi and other village industries.
('85', 41, 9, 27, 85671) G. Yes, I do not want to confine myself to khadi alone now.
('85', 41, 9, 28, 85731) I am, therefore, thinking of ways and means of improving the condition of the people through a rehabilitation of agriculture, cattle breeding and all other village industries.
('85', 41, 9, 29, 85907) My problem will be solved if I succeed even in half a dozen villages, for as is the part so is the whole.
('85', 41, 10, 30, 86013) J. That means we shall have to develop the villages keeping their allround progress in view.
('85', 41, 10, 31, 86106) We should emphasize not only the economic aspect of khadi but explain its moral and social aspect also.
('85', 42, 0, 1, 86210) VOL.85 : 2 OCTOBER, 1944 3 MARCH, 1945 43
('85', 42, 1, 2, 86252) G. From this point of view even Vallabhswamis method does not appeal to me, for he emphasizes only khadi and promises to make the entire village khadi clad within a certain period.
('85', 42, 1, 3, 86433) There was a time when this idea appealed to me immensely, but now I feel that khadi alone cannot revive the villages.
('85', 42, 1, 4, 86551) Village uplift is possible only when we rejuvenate village life as a whole, revive all village industries and make the entire village industrious.

('85', 43, 3, 6, 87566) I think a representation should be sent to the Central Government about the fine.
('85', 43, 4, 7, 87648) From a photostat: G.N. 2097
('85', 43, 5, 8, 87676) 48. DISCUSSION WITH SHRIKRISHNADAS JAJU
('85', 43, 6, 9, 87716) October 13, 1944
('85', 43, 7, 10, 87733) J. Today I would request you to throw more light on decentralization.
('85', 43, 7, 11, 87803) Narrowly viewed, there is even now decentralization in production because production centres are distributed all over the country.
('85', 43, 7, 12, 87934) But of course all capital is centralized in the Head Office.
('85', 43, 7, 13, 87995) I believe that the central control existing today is merely a control exercised by the A.I.S.A. in regard to policy.
('85', 43, 8, 14, 88112) Looking at the matter from the point of view of capital we must consider under whose initiative the work is to be carried on in the villages hereafter and who is to bear the profit or loss in the end.
('85', 43, 8, 15, 88313) Now there are three ways of doing this.
('85', 43, 9, 16, 88353) Our worker on the spot can carry on all the work.
('85', 43, 9, 17, 88403) Or, we may work through a committee of villagers interested in khadi work who may themselves raise shares, subscriptions, etc.
('85', 43, 9, 18, 88530) Or as a third course the artisans of khadi can form their own societies and carry on the work as their own.
('85', 43, 9, 19, 88638) If the worker remains solely in charge we shall have to hand over to him all the assets, money, property, etc.
('85', 43, 9, 20, 88749) Should he then be regarded as a trustee or should some condition be imposed upon him?
('85', 43, 9, 21, 88835) If the worker carries on his activities with an eye to personal profit there is every likelihood of undesirable developments.
('85', 43, 9, 22, 88961) I think the best way, therefore, would be to form co operative societies.
('85', 43, 9, 23, 89035) Selfish interests may lead to some mismanagement but this fear should not deter us.
('85', 43, 9, 24, 89119) We may have co operative societies not only for khadi but also for oil pressing, hand paper, etc.
('85', 43, 9, 25, 89217) In course of time these bodies in the various villages may, if necessary, merge into a union.

('85', 44, 0, 1, 89334) VOL.85 : 2 OCTOBER, 1944 3 MARCH, 1945 45
('85', 44, 1, 2, 89376) G. I do not have much to say on this point.
('85', 44, 1, 3, 89420) Wherever we can get reliable workers work should be started.
('85', 44, 1, 4, 89481) There is no harm in beginning simultaneously the three types of experiments you have enumerated.
('85', 44, 1, 5, 89578) But, as we had discussed yesterday, we can get rid of many worries if we do not hold ourselves responsible for khadi sales.
('85', 44, 1, 6, 89702) So long as khadi remains a saleable commodity, these worries are bound to be there.
('85', 44, 1, 7, 89786) I also realize that we cannot entirely get rid of them today.
('85', 44, 1, 8, 89848) But so long as we believe that khadi, like bread, must be made at home and that we should not maintain ourselves on bazar made biscuits even if cheaper, we shall have to explain to the people that to use bazar made goods is to court disaster.
('85', 44, 1, 9, 90091) If the people grasp the idea, we shall have to devise an easy method of khadi manufacture at home.
('85', 44, 1, 10, 90190) Our slogan will be cloth even like bread.
('85', 44, 1, 11, 90232) All difficulties will then disappear.
('85', 44, 1, 12, 90270) The co operative bodies will then have their own shape and form which need not now be anticipated.
('85', 44, 1, 13, 90369) When you said that there was decentralization in khadi production, I was about to contradict you.
('85', 44, 1, 14, 90467) Even in Lancashire some cloth is made at home, not for the use of the home but for the use of the masters.
('85', 44, 1, 15, 90574) It would be outrageous to call this decentralization.
('85', 44, 1, 16, 90628) So also in Japan everything is made at home; but it is not for the use of the home; it is all for the Government which has centralized the whole business.
('85', 44, 1, 17, 90783) Though things are made at home, and made in a better manner than in England, yet the producers cannot keep any of it for their home consumption.
('85', 44, 1, 18, 90928) The work is done at the behest of the Government which supplies ships and does everything else to carry such goods to the different markets of the world and thus draw wealth from other countries.
('85', 44, 1, 19, 91124) The same is happening in Lancashire.
('85', 44, 1, 20, 91161) Though millions of dhotis are made there, yet not a single one is available to any purchaser on the spot.
('85', 44, 1, 21, 91267) They are exported to the country for which they are scheduled, be it India, Africa or any other.
('85', 44, 1, 22, 91364) I would certainly not call this decentralization.
('85', 44, 1, 23, 91414) So also with khadi.
('85', 44, 1, 24, 91434) Our artisans produce not for themselves but for the A. I. S. A. to which they give their finished material for wages paid.
('85', 44, 1, 25, 91557) They were happy when we raised their wages.
('85', 44, 1, 26, 91601) But this is not decentralization.
('85', 44, 1, 27, 91635) What I mean by decentralization is that the artisan must produce for his own or his neighbours use and not for sale.
('85', 44, 1, 28, 91752) When we realize that khadi is not a commodity for sale but for self consumption only then we shall have grasped the message of khadi and understood the scope of its potentialities.
('85', 44, 1, 29, 91933) We may be
('85', 45, 0, 1, 91943) 46 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('85', 45, 1, 2, 91984) expected to clothe the whole country with khadi after getting political power.
('85', 45, 1, 3, 92063) Should we not therefore make such an arrangement from today so that we may be able to make the country self sufficient in clothing in case the future government of free India were to provide the requisite facilities to the A. I. S. A. and ask it, as an expert body, to do this task?
('85', 45, 1, 4, 92346) But if the government of the day were to close all its mills, and to charge us with this responsibility, we are apt to fail as things are today.
('85', 45, 1, 5, 92491) We should, therefore, know the extent to which khadi can take us.
('85', 45, 1, 6, 92557) I myself cannot say that I know it for certain.
('85', 45, 1, 7, 92605) But what I am quite clear about is that khadi should not be for sale but for self consumption.
('85', 45, 1, 8, 92700) Hence the necessity of changing the present policy of khadi work.
('85', 45, 1, 9, 92766) We have before us the task of reconstructing our whole country, and in this khadi is an important item.
('85', 45, 1, 10, 92870) So also there are oil pressing and other industries.
('85', 45, 1, 11, 92923) It is only if we look at the problem from the point of view of production for use rather than for sale that the country has everything to gain by Our work, and we shall be able to meet the situation squarely without withdrawing a single step when we obtain control over the reins of Government.
('85', 45, 2, 12, 93218) J. I presume what you mean is that we should direct all our efforts towards cloth self sufficiency, i.e., towards spinning for ones own consumption.
('85', 45, 3, 13, 93367) G. Exactly so.
('85', 45, 3, 14, 93382) But as I have no personal experience about it I cannot insist on it.
('85', 45, 3, 15, 93451) I first introduced khadi and only later studied its implications and experimented with it.
('85', 45, 3, 16, 93542) I find that I have been deceiving myself.
('85', 45, 3, 17, 93584) What I gave to the people was money in the form of wages and assured them that it contained swaraj.
('85', 45, 3, 18, 93684) People took me at my word and believed me, and continue to believe me.
('85', 45, 3, 19, 93755) But I have now my own misgivings as to how far such khadi can lead to swaraj.
('85', 45, 3, 20, 93833) I am afraid that khadi has no future if we continue it as today.
('85', 45, 4, 21, 93898) J. Do you visualize a stage in which the khadi bhandars running presently in the cities will be closed down?
('85', 45, 5, 22, 94007) G. Of course I do.
('85', 45, 6, 23, 94026) J. We shall then have to supply khadi to the people in lieu of yarn alone.
('85', 45, 7, 24, 94101) G. When we saw that we could not proceed without spinning we learnt spinning.
('85', 45, 7, 25, 94179) But we did not take to weaving.
('85', 45, 7, 26, 94211) However, now we feel that weavers will also have to be trained in the same manner.
('85', 45, 7, 27, 94294) Whatever changes we want to introduce we must introduce intelligently and with discrimination.
('85', 45, 7, 28, 94389) I may recall what we did about living wages in spinning.
('85', 45, 7, 29, 94446) We went along certain lines.
('85', 45, 7, 30, 94475) Slowly it dawned upon us that khadi so
('85', 46, 0, 1, 94514) VOL.85 : 2 OCTOBER, 1944 3 MARCH, 1945 47
('85', 46, 1, 2, 94556) produced was no philanthropy but an exploitation of spinners.
('85', 46, 1, 3, 94618) We then raised the wages.
('85', 46, 1, 4, 94644) I pleaded for eight annas.
('85', 46, 1, 5, 94671) The rest of you insisted on three annas.
('85', 46, 1, 6, 94712) I agreed to your three annas.
('85', 46, 1, 7, 94742) Then you raised it to four annas.
('85', 46, 1, 8, 94776) Similarly we may proceed in our new attempt.
('85', 46, 1, 9, 94821) First you must accept the principle, later we shall proceed in the light of our experience.
('85', 46, 1, 10, 94913) You have pointed out three possible ways of reorganizing the work on the new basis.
('85', 46, 1, 11, 94997) Think over them.
('85', 46, 1, 12, 95014) We have got our machinery in every province.
('85', 46, 1, 13, 95059) Provincial organizers are already there.
('85', 46, 1, 14, 95100) Call some of the workers and discuss the matter in detail with them.
('85', 46, 1, 15, 95169) True, it will mean some curtailment of our present work.
('85', 46, 1, 16, 95226) But that will not deter me.
('85', 46, 1, 17, 95254) Even if nobody else spins I shall go on spinning alone.
('85', 46, 1, 18, 95310) When we started khadi production I was told that khadi dhoti was impossible to produce.
('85', 46, 1, 19, 95398) I replied that I would put on sack cloth or a blanket but would not wear a mill dhoti.
('85', 46, 1, 20, 95485) And hardly a month passed when Maganlal produced a dhoti; Gangabehn Majmudar also sent me one and asked me to place an order for any number of them.
('85', 46, 2, 21, 95634) J. It means we shall have to stop the large scale sale of khadi in the cities and instead ask the people to take up spinning for themselves.
('85', 46, 2, 22, 95775) Consequently, at least for some time a lot of our work will come to a stop.
('85', 46, 3, 23, 95851) G. I agree that there is practical consideration behind what you say.
('85', 46, 3, 24, 95921) Today people have become paupers.
('85', 46, 3, 25, 95955) Therefore if you provide them with bread they will do whatever you ask them to do.
('85', 46, 3, 26, 96038) But if we carry on our work thoughtlessly we shall be deceiving them as well as ourselves.
('85', 46, 3, 27, 96129) The livelihood we provide them today is nothing but a sort of dole as is usually handed out during the time Of famine to the people who are offered work on the roads or quarries.
('85', 46, 3, 28, 96308) It does not have a lasting value.
('85', 46, 4, 29, 96342) J. Before asking khadi consumers to spin their own yarn we should consider how much we ourselves are devoted to spinning.
('85', 46, 4, 30, 96464) Let me take the instance of the A.I.S.A. workers.
('85', 46, 4, 31, 96514) Our rule requires every worker to spin at least 7_ hanks in a month.
('85', 46, 4, 32, 96583) But we have not had a satisfactory response.
('85', 46, 4, 33, 96628) Further, the number of spinners among the khadi customers is quite small.
('85', 46, 4, 34, 96702) Most of the spinners in the countryside spin only for wages, scarcely for their own use.
('85', 46, 4, 35, 96791) This is the situation.
('85', 46, 4, 36, 96814) I wonder how far the experiment you suggest can succeed under these circumstances.
('85', 46, 5, 37, 96897) G. At least this much should be clear to all that khadi is not an occupation or a craft merely for earning a livelihood.
('85', 46, 5, 38, 97018) None of us should harbour this idea.
('85', 46, 5, 39, 97055) For, if khadi is an industry it would have to be run purely on business lines.
('85', 46, 5, 40, 97134) The difference between khadi and mill cloth would then be that while a mill provides employment to a
('85', 47, 0, 1, 97235) 48 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('85', 47, 1, 2, 97276) few thousand people in a city, khadi brings a crore of rupees to those scattered about in fifteen thousand villages.
('85', 47, 1, 3, 97393) Both must then be classified as industries, and we would hardly be justified in asking anybody to put on khadi and boycott mill cloth.
('85', 47, 1, 4, 97528) Nor can such khadi claim to be the herald of swaraj.
('85', 47, 1, 5, 97581) On the other hand we have claimed that the real significance of khadi is that it is a means for uplifting the villages and thereby generating in the people the spontaneous strength for swaraj.
('85', 47, 1, 6, 97774) Such a claim cannot then be sustained.
('85', 47, 1, 7, 97813) It will not do to continue to help the villagers by appealing to the philanthropic sentiments of city dwellers.
('85', 47, 1, 8, 97925) What is required is that the villagers should be made strong to face lifes problems and march ahead.
('85', 47, 1, 9, 98026) If we encouraged mills, the nation might get sufficient cloth.
('85', 47, 1, 10, 98089) And if mills are nationalized cloth prices may also come down, people may not be exploited and may earn adequate wages.
('85', 47, 1, 11, 98209) But our reason for putting forward khadi is that it is the only way to redeem the people from the disease of inertia and indifference, the only way to generate in them the strength for freedom.
('85', 47, 1, 12, 98403) If other crafts are also thus revitalized, our villages could be made self sufficient and self reliant.
('85', 47, 1, 13, 98507) They would prepare their own soap from sajji clay.
('85', 47, 1, 14, 98558) That soap will not have the luring fragrance of soaps turned out in the factories of Tata and Godrej.
('85', 47, 1, 15, 98660) Its packing also will not be so attractive.
('85', 47, 1, 16, 98704) But it will have the quality of self sufficiency even like khadi.
('85', 47, 1, 17, 98770) But this grand picture of khadi as the means of all round uplift of the villages, which I have been putting forward for so long, is not being realized.
('85', 47, 1, 18, 98922) The talks I have had with the workers have led me to believe that I must now retrace my steps.
('85', 47, 1, 19, 99017) As the founder of khadi, I must not grudge doing so.
('85', 47, 1, 20, 99070) That is the call of truth.
('85', 47, 1, 21, 99097) I retrace my steps consciously or intelligently, and not in a mood of defeatism or of cowardice.
('85', 47, 1, 22, 99194) If there was any exaggeration in my claims for khadi it is but right that I must own it publicly and rectify it.
('85', 47, 2, 23, 99307) J. Our chief claim was that khadi was a craft whereby those who were forced to remain idle for a few months in the year could have some supplementary earning.
('85', 47, 3, 24, 99466) G. No, I did not stop at that.
('85', 47, 3, 25, 99497) I went further and claimed that it had the capacity to bring swaraj.
('85', 47, 4, 26, 99566) J. That is true, but you did not stress so much its life giving capacity as you are doing today.
('85', 47, 4, 27, 99663) About three lakhs of people are employed in khadi work.
('85', 47, 4, 28, 99719) They cannot quickly develop the manifold virtues (other than those of self sufficiency) that you desire.
('85', 47, 4, 29, 99824) They may do so in course of time.
('85', 47, 4, 30, 99858) What you want to do today is to stop khadi sales and make people spin for their own needs, do you not?
('85', 47, 5, 31, 99961) G. You are right.
('85', 48, 0, 1, 99979) VOL.85 : 2 OCTOBER, 1944 3 MARCH, 1945 49
('85', 48, 1, 2, 100021) J. But a closure of the sales would mean a suspension of spinning for wages.
('85', 48, 2, 3, 100098) G. Of course.
('85', 48, 2, 4, 100112) But the little amount of spinning we may then have would positively be such as can yield swaraj.
('85', 48, 2, 5, 100209) For basically that strength is inherent in spinning.
('85', 48, 3, 6, 100262) J. Today we are in contact with about three lakhs of people through khadi work.
('85', 48, 3, 7, 100342) Requiring people to spin for self sufficiency, we would reduce it to no more than thirty thousand.
('85', 48, 4, 8, 100441) G. These thirty thousand would later grow into three crores.
('85', 48, 4, 9, 100502) Be it as it may, I at least will not be guilty of betraying the cause.
('85', 48, 4, 10, 100573) Further, we shall then not have to cajole or coax the villagers and artisans to spin.
('85', 48, 4, 11, 100659) What we do today is to go to the villagers with a money bag like bankers and promise four or six annas for spinning.
('85', 48, 4, 12, 100776) Instead, we would enter into the life of the villagers.
('85', 48, 4, 13, 100832) The workers and the villagers would freely lay bare their hearts before each other.
('85', 48, 4, 14, 100916) We would raise the wage of the (woman) spinner.
('85', 48, 4, 15, 100964) I would pay her as much as to a man.
('85', 48, 4, 16, 101001) But I would tell her clearly that I am not interested in her spinning merely for a wage.
('85', 48, 4, 17, 101090) I would ask her to spin for herself.
('85', 48, 4, 18, 101127) I would promise to get her yarn woven, her children educated and trained in one craft or another.
('85', 48, 4, 19, 101225) I would enquire into her budget and promise every assistance.
('85', 48, 4, 20, 101287) I would try and relieve her of her woes.
('85', 48, 4, 21, 101328) Had we done this from the beginning and taken the right type of workers with us, we would have assuredly secured freedom by now.
('85', 48, 4, 22, 101457) But I have no regret for the past.
('85', 48, 5, 23, 101492) J. Do you think that you can get a large number of workers of this type?
('85', 48, 5, 24, 101565) If so, it is easy sailing.
('85', 48, 6, 25, 101592) G. The mistake was undoubtedly ours.
('85', 48, 6, 26, 101629) We did not keep this point of view ever before us.
('85', 48, 6, 27, 101680) Nor did we train workers for it.
('85', 48, 6, 28, 101713) Also we were in too much hurry.
('85', 48, 6, 29, 101745) Had we devoted ourselves to the task intelligently, we would have got the needed workers.
('85', 48, 7, 30, 101835) J. You have said many a time that good workers should go and settle in the villages.
('85', 48, 8, 31, 101920) G. Yes, in order that they may make khadi the emblem of non violence.
('85', 48, 8, 32, 101990) If we fail, our claim for khadi will lose all force.
('85', 48, 9, 33, 102043) J. After all we shall have to get our workers from the material that we have in our country today.
('85', 48, 10, 34, 102142) G. If that is our attitude there can be no swaraj through non violence.
('85', 48, 10, 35, 102214) In other words, people are not ready for my conception of swaraj.
('85', 48, 10, 36, 102280) I would then go my own way even if I have to work all alone.
('85', 49, 0, 1, 102341) 50 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('85', 49, 1, 2, 102382) would be happy if any of the A. I. S. A., A. I. V. I. A., Hindustani Talimi Sangh or other bodies co operate with me.
('85', 49, 1, 3, 102500) It is quite possible that people may not follow us.
('85', 49, 1, 4, 102552) It would then show that we are full of violence and that the non violence we talk about is not non violence but cowardice.
('85', 49, 2, 5, 102675) J. That is all right.
('85', 49, 2, 6, 102697) But the question is one of implementation.
('85', 49, 3, 7, 102740) G. We should then renounce the tall claim we have made.
('85', 49, 3, 8, 102796) We must stick to the truth.
('85', 49, 3, 9, 102824) Without hesitation, without flattering ourselves we must declare that we are weak like everybody else and that we are in no way better.
('85', 49, 3, 10, 102960) It would then be clear that swaraj, if and when obtained, will not be due to any special strength of ours.

('85', 52, 1, 2, 106174) 55. DISCUSSION WITH SHRIKRISHNADAS JAJU
('85', 52, 2, 3, 106214) October 14, 1944
('85', 52, 3, 4, 106231) J. If your programme of village reconstruction as a whole is to be taken up, we must select and train efficient workers.
('85', 52, 4, 5, 106352) Then there will be the question of training workers for which we would have to start vidyalayas in every province and frame syllabi for them.
('85', 52, 4, 6, 106494) There is a great dearth of able teachers.
('85', 52, 4, 7, 106536) Our first grade workers have confined themselves to their particular areasto their village, tehsil or district.
('85', 52, 5, 8, 106648) I do not quite see how the new work can be accomplished unless we divert some of these workers from their field to the training centres.
('85', 52, 5, 9, 106785) Who else can impart the right attitude and approach to village workers?
('85', 52, 6, 10, 106857) G. Khadi work started in the beginning from a single centre.
('85', 52, 6, 11, 106918) So also now we may begin with only one training centre.
('85', 52, 6, 12, 106974) We shall prepare graduates there and send them to other centres.
('85', 52, 6, 13, 107039) They will produce other workers who will start yet more centres.
('85', 52, 7, 14, 107104) J. It may involve a lot of time, from five to even ten years.
('85', 52, 8, 15, 107166) G. Possibly, but I do not think so.
('85', 52, 8, 16, 107202) Our first batch will consist of those who have already enough prior preparation, and so they will not take long to go out as full fledged workers.
('85', 52, 8, 17, 107349) Again, as soon as they have acquired a certain amount of efficiency we shall ask them to go out to the villages and add to their store of knowledge by dint of actual experience in the field.
('85', 52, 8, 18, 107540) I do not, therefore, feel that a large amount of time will have to be spent on training.
('85', 52, 8, 19, 107629) But even if it is, we should not worry.
('85', 52, 8, 20, 107669) If we do not get workers of the highest quality it does not matter.
('85', 52, 8, 21, 107737) We will try to obtain the finest material, but be ready to do with what we can get at present.
('85', 52, 9, 22, 107832) J. The workers we got in 1920 proved their worth.
('85', 52, 9, 23, 107882) Thereafter we did not secure that high type of workers in so large a measure.
('85', 52, 9, 24, 107960) Some did come indeed, and do come, but in very small numbers.
('85', 52, 10, 25, 108022) G. The fact is our method was defective and there was little in our programme to attract the better type.
('85', 52, 10, 26, 108128) There seemed to be little scope for intellectual development in our work.
('85', 52, 10, 27, 108202) Hence a large number of people did not feel attracted to it.
('85', 52, 10, 28, 108263) Besides the remunerative attraction present in other fields was not there.
('85', 52, 10, 29, 108338) But what was worse, a sort of ignorance and inertia characterized the khadi workers, which made others look down on them.
('85', 52, 10, 30, 108460) People felt that khadi workers did not dress properly, looked dirty and were quite often devoid of common sense.
('85', 52, 10, 31, 108573) The workers did not have adequate knowledge of the science of khadi and so did little to explain it to the people.
('85', 52, 10, 32, 108688) They were
('85', 53, 0, 1, 108698) 54 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('85', 53, 1, 2, 108739) often not in a position to answer the simple questions of those who wanted to know.
('85', 53, 1, 3, 108823) We did settle in the villages where we provided work to the villagers.
('85', 53, 1, 4, 108894) But the intellectual among us did not, to any large extent.
('85', 53, 1, 5, 108954) The few who worked did not have the attitude of an anxious and earnest devotee eager to explain his viewpoint to the people.
('85', 53, 1, 6, 109079) 1 If we had we would have become such experts in our work that we would have been in a position to declare before economists, We know all that you know.
('85', 53, 1, 7, 109232) But you lack the practical knowledge that we have.
('85', 53, 1, 8, 109283) This you can learn from us.
('85', 53, 2, 9, 109311) J. True.
('85', 53, 2, 10, 109320) Our knowledge is incomplete and we have very many defects.
('85', 53, 2, 11, 109379) But our scale of measuring values is also different.
('85', 53, 3, 12, 109432) G. May be, but we must have the capacity to tell them that their scale is not right.
('85', 53, 4, 13, 109517) J. But how to compare moral values with material values?
('85', 53, 5, 14, 109574) G. Then you could at least place those moral values before them and prove their worth.
('85', 53, 5, 15, 109661) If I come to realize today that khadi alone is not going to last I shall have to proclaim it to the world.
('85', 53, 5, 16, 109768) So far as the material value of khadi goes, even Government records show that there is a place for the spinning wheel as a means of relief, like stone breaking, road making, etc.
('85', 53, 5, 17, 109947) You also can establish this much that khadi has an invariable place as a relief measure.
('85', 53, 5, 18, 110036) But what we are required to prove above all is the need for khadi to establish a strong, non violent village economy.
('85', 53, 5, 19, 110154) We shall see what difficulties we come across in working the programme of self sufficiency.
('85', 53, 5, 20, 110246) Commercial khadi may continue for a time, but the essential programme of the A.I.S.A. hereafter must be that of self sufficiency, and workers should concentrate all their thought and energy on it.

('85', 57, 3, 5, 114983) Moreover, he happens to be in full sympathy with the way of life for which I stand.
('85', 57, 3, 6, 115067) This brochure is an attempt to interpret it in terms of modern political science.
('85', 57, 3, 7, 115149) Acharya Agrawal seems to have made an earnest study of modern literature on the subject.
('85', 57, 3, 8, 115238) I am sorry to have to say that I have not gone through the treatise with the attention it deserves.
('85', 57, 3, 9, 115338) Nevertheless I have read enough of it to be able to say that he has not misrepresented me in any place.
('85', 57, 3, 10, 115442) There is no pretence at an exhaustive presentation of the implications of the charkha economics.
('85', 57, 3, 11, 115539) It claims to be a comparative study of the charkha economics based on non violence and the industrial economics which to be paying must be based on violence, i.e., exploitation of the non industrialized countries.
('85', 57, 3, 12, 115753) Let me not anticipate the authors argument.
('85', 57, 3, 13, 115797) I commend the treatise to the careful attention of every student of the present deplorable condition of the country.

('85', 57, 6, 16, 115981) SEVAGRAM, October 16, 1944
('85', 57, 7, 17, 116008) Mrs. Vijayalaxmi Pandit has asked me to pen a few words about the late Ranjit Pandits unfinished rendering of Ritusanhar.
('85', 57, 7, 18, 116130) I consider myself wholly unfit to do justice to the authors effort nor does Vijayalaxmi expect me to attempt the impossible.
('85', 57, 7, 19, 116255) But the touching circumstances under which Ranjit Pandit made the effort need emphasising.
('85', 57, 7, 20, 116346) It is remakable how much India owes to political imprisonments.
('85', 57, 7, 21, 116410) Lokmanyas celebrated work on the Gita would not have seen the light of day but for his imprisonment nor Jawaharlal Nehrus world known works.
('85', 57, 7, 22, 116551) Ranjit Pandits Rajtarangini and his labours on Ritusanhar might not have been but for his imprison ments.
('85', 57, 7, 23, 116657) And he was ailing in the prison.
('85', 57, 7, 24, 116690) His literary labours made him forget his pain.
('85', 57, 7, 25, 116737) Instead of a preface the authors introductory notes
('85', 58, 0, 1, 116789) VOL.85 : 2 OCTOBER, 1944 3 MARCH, 1945 59
('85', 58, 1, 2, 116831) are deeply interesting and instructive.
('85', 58, 1, 3, 116871) It reveals to us Ranjit Pandit as a patriot and scholar.
('85', 58, 1, 4, 116928) Having known him intimately I know what talents he had.
('85', 58, 1, 5, 116984) It is a sad thought that such a son of India should have died in the prime of life.
('85', 58, 1, 6, 117068) I congratulate Vijayalaxmi on giving to India and the world her husbands last labour of love.

('85', 59, 3, 5, 118378) The inquiry is now on under Jajujis supervision.
('85', 59, 3, 6, 118427) Hence I will not express any clear opinion at the moment.

('85', 59, 8, 14, 118816) I beg your forgiveness for that.
('85', 59, 8, 15, 118849) However, though my misunderstanding you two may be pardonable, whose forgiveness am I to ask for having taken interest in your story of a theft and the remarks I made on hearing the report?
('85', 59, 8, 16, 119039) It has relieved me somewhat to know that Jinnah Saheb has punished me fairly well for that.
('85', 59, 8, 17, 119131) But for me this punishment is not enough.
('85', 59, 8, 18, 119173) The alternating improvement and worsening in your health is not a good sign.

('85', 60, 3, 5, 119619) He had passed on [the relevant things] for me to peruse.
('85', 60, 3, 6, 119676) He also gave me the letter addressed to you which I have read.
('85', 60, 3, 7, 119739) I find that no office bearer has made any allegation against you.
('85', 60, 3, 8, 119805) Bhai Dhotre 1 never had any suspicion.
('85', 60, 3, 9, 119844) And why should he?
('85', 60, 3, 10, 119863) You are not asking for the return of some money that had been given away.
('85', 60, 3, 11, 119937) You have only asked for the substantiation of any charges against you.
('85', 60, 3, 12, 120008) There is no allegation, however.
('85', 60, 3, 13, 120041) But I dont like your rejoinder to Jajuji.
('85', 60, 3, 14, 120083) It reads like a lawyers reply.
('85', 60, 3, 15, 120114) It is not worthy of a votary of non violence.
('85', 60, 3, 16, 120160) Jajuji had asked the questions only to refresh his memory and you ought to have answered them.
('85', 60, 3, 17, 120255) I want you to answer them even now.
('85', 60, 3, 18, 120291) Do you really have any khadi activity there these days?

('85', 61, 3, 6, 121285) Subsequently I came to know that this Harijan had come to you.
('85', 61, 3, 7, 121348) He is a good man; sort of a labourer and a little moody.
('85', 61, 3, 8, 121405) He insulted a lady and on being scolded he ran away the day before yesterday.
('85', 61, 3, 9, 121483) He was given the fare and sent home.
('85', 61, 3, 10, 121520) I think so long as such Harijans are willing to abide by our rules we should have a place for them.
('85', 61, 3, 11, 121620) Such a situation is the consequence of the sins of Hindu society.
('85', 61, 3, 12, 121686) I can however understand your difficulties.
('85', 61, 3, 13, 121730) The student who arrived here must have spoken to you.

('85', 62, 3, 4, 122694) BHAI SOHANLALJI, I have gone through both your letters.
('85', 62, 3, 5, 122750) I had a vague impression that you liked my idea.
('85', 62, 3, 6, 122799) It was this: It is a bad practice to over price a book to secure donations.
('85', 62, 3, 7, 122875) And associating a name with such a price rise is worse.
('85', 62, 3, 8, 122931) I have conveyed the same view to Ghanshyamdasji.
('85', 62, 4, 9, 122980) What shall I say about the merits and demerits of your work?
('85', 62, 4, 10, 123041) I have no capacity to judge poetry.
('85', 62, 4, 11, 123077) How can I speak about poems written in my own praise?
('85', 62, 4, 12, 123131) Of course I can say you have put in a lot of labour and no worthy labour is ever wasted.
('85', 62, 5, 13, 123220) If you sell your work at market price we would at least know its comparative value.
('85', 62, 5, 14, 123304) No special effort should be made to sponsor the sale.
('85', 62, 5, 15, 123358) Many books sell on their own merit without any effort.
('85', 62, 5, 16, 123413) You may realize your own expenses from the amount you have collected and, with the permission of the donors, send the balance to me for Harijan work or donate it for some altruistic work.

('85', 63, 7, 13, 124362) Vidya was a priceless girl with her thoughts always turned towards God.
('85', 63, 7, 14, 124434) I miss her probably as much as you do.
('85', 63, 7, 15, 124473) But Anand is simply disconsolate.
('85', 63, 7, 16, 124507) I tell him, in being so he fails to be true to Vidya.

('85', 64, 3, 5, 125541) But you have of course given your consent for it.
('85', 64, 3, 6, 125591) They wanted to marry even while I was in jail.

('85', 73, 7, 11, 136605) I never had any faith in the parliamentary programme.
('85', 73, 7, 12, 136659) I have tolerated it as I tolerate many things.
('85', 73, 7, 13, 136706) You know where my faith lies.

('85', 73, 12, 19, 136944) BHAI ATMARAM, I have just heard that in the name of non violence you have given up milk and milk products as also medicines.
('85', 73, 12, 20, 137069) I do not at all approve of this.
('85', 73, 12, 21, 137102) After all am I not the sole source of these beliefs?
('85', 73, 12, 22, 137155) You know that I do take milk although not cows or buffalos.
('85', 73, 12, 23, 137215) Hence there is now no point in my having given up milk.
('85', 73, 12, 24, 137271) We shall all give up milk when there is someone among us who will guide us towards intelligently giving up all milk as such.
('85', 73, 12, 25, 137396) Understand that the same

('85', 74, 1, 3, 137485) You can be said to have truly given up medicines if you ate all your food regarding it as medicine.
('85', 74, 1, 4, 137585) Know it to be your dharma to preserve your body which is to be utilized for public good.

('85', 74, 3, 11, 137994) But perhaps for Sanskrit accuracy of pronunciation is imperative.

('85', 74, 5, 20, 138515) Physical nearness is not always necessary for such support.
('85', 74, 5, 21, 138575) Some find it through correspondence, some through meditation and still others through the noble words of the dead, just as we meet Tulsidas every day.

('85', 75, 2, 3, 138974) SEVAGRAM, October 22, 1944
('85', 75, 3, 4, 139001) Congressmen should read without passion Dr. Mahmuds letters to the Viceroy and his statement to the Press releasing those letters.
('85', 75, 3, 5, 139132) The motive in writing the letters was undoubtedly pure.
('85', 75, 3, 6, 139188) He did not want his release before that of his colleagues of the Working Committee and yet the Government could not, consistently with their declaration, detain Dr. Mahmud after his unequivocal dissociation from the very start with the civil resistance clause of the A. I. C. C. Resolution 1 of 8th August 1942. Where Dr. Mahmud erred was in not informing his fellow detenus of the letters.
('85', 75, 3, 7, 139579) If he suppressed himself for so long he could not, without consultation and without authority from them, write to the Government what his mind was at the time the Resolution was passed.
('85', 75, 3, 8, 139765) The practical question for Congressmen is whether they are to make use of Dr. Mahmuds services or ostracize him for the impropriety he admits having committed.
('85', 75, 3, 9, 139925) I have no doubt whatsoever that they should make the best use possible of the services for which his long and unbroken connection with the Congress makes him eminently fit.
('85', 75, 3, 10, 140098) For me, in spite of his indiscretion, he remains the same dear friend he has been since the Khilafat and before.

('85', 76, 1, 2, 140617) 100. HINTS FOR CONSTRUCTIVE WORKERS 1
('85', 76, 2, 3, 140655) Workers should definitely realize that the constructive programme is the non violent and truthful way of winning purna swaraj.
('85', 76, 2, 4, 140782) Its wholesale fulfilment is complete independence.
('85', 76, 2, 5, 140833) Imagine all the forty crores of people engaged in the constructive programme which is designed to build up the nation from the very bottom upward.
('85', 76, 2, 6, 140980) Can anybody dispute the proposition that it must mean complete independence in every sense of the expression, including the ousting of foreign domination?
('85', 76, 2, 7, 141135) When the critics laugh at the proposition, what they mean is that forty crores of people will never co operate in the effort to fulfil the programme.
('85', 76, 2, 8, 141285) No doubt there is considerable truth in the scoff.
('85', 76, 2, 9, 141336) My answer is, it is worth the attempt.
('85', 76, 2, 10, 141375) Given an indomitable will on the part of a band of earnest workers, the programme is as workable as any other and more so than most.
('85', 76, 2, 11, 141508) Anyway, I have no substitute for it, if it is to be based on non violence.
('85', 76, 2, 12, 141583) Civil disobedience, mass or individual, is an aid to constructive effort and is a full substitute for armed revolt.
('85', 76, 2, 13, 141699) Just as military training is necessary for armed revolt, training in constructive effort is equally necessary for civil resistance.
('85', 76, 2, 14, 141831) And just as the use of arms becomes necessary only when an occasion demands it, even so is the use of civil resistance only occasional.
('85', 76, 2, 15, 141967) Therefore workers will never be on the look out for civil resistance.
('85', 76, 2, 16, 142037) They will hold themselves in readiness, if the constructive effort is sought to be defeated.
('85', 76, 2, 17, 142130) To take one or two illustrations, effort for communal friendship cannot be defeated, political pacts can.
('85', 76, 2, 18, 142236) But political pacts are required because of the previous lack of friendship.
('85', 76, 2, 19, 142313) Similarly khadi manufacture and its use cannot be defeated if both become fairly universal.
('85', 76, 2, 20, 142405) The manufacture and use are not to be brought about by imposing them upon the people, but they have to be intelligently accepted by them as some of the necessary items of the freedom movement, when it is worked from the villages as units.
('85', 76, 2, 21, 142644) Pioneers even in such programmes are likely to be obstructed.
('85', 76, 2, 22, 142706) They have had to go through the fire of suffering throughout the
('85', 76, 3, 23, 142771) 1 This was sent to the Workers Conference held in Bombay on October 28 and 29 under the presidentship of N. V. Gadgil.
('85', 76, 3, 24, 142890) Congressmen from Maharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka also participated in the Conference.
('85', 77, 0, 1, 142979) 78 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('85', 77, 1, 2, 143020) There is no swaraj without suffering.
('85', 77, 1, 3, 143058) In violence truth is the greatest sufferer; in non violence truth is ever triumphant.
('85', 77, 1, 4, 143144) If this preliminary observation has gone home to the reader he will find the constructive programme to be full of deep interest.
('85', 77, 1, 5, 143273) It should prove as absorbing as politics so called and platform oratory.
('85', 77, 1, 6, 143346) The detailed constructive programme is to be found in my pamphlet 1 on it, and Dr. Rajendra Prasads 2 which is a running commentary on it.
('85', 77, 1, 7, 143485) It should be remembered that it is illustrative, not exhaustive.
('85', 77, 1, 8, 143550) Local circumstances may suggest many more items not touched in the printed programme.
('85', 77, 1, 9, 143636) These are beyond the scope of a treatise on an all India programme.
('85', 77, 1, 10, 143704) They are necessarily for local workers to find out and do the needful.
('85', 77, 1, 11, 143775) In these hints I have singled out some items for fuller emphasis in the light of experience gained since the publication of the programme.
('85', 77, 1, 12, 143914) The kisan or the peasant, whether as a landless labourer or a labouring proprietor, comes first.
('85', 77, 1, 13, 144011) He is the son of the soil which rightly belongs or should belong to him, not to the absentee landlord or zamindar.
('85', 77, 1, 14, 144126) But in the non violent way the labourer cannot forcibly eject the absentee landlord.
('85', 77, 1, 15, 144211) He has so to work as to make it impossible for the landlord to exploit him.
('85', 77, 1, 16, 144287) Closest co operation amongst the peasants is absolutely necessary.
('85', 77, 1, 17, 144354) To this end, special organizing bodies or committees should be formed where there are none and those already in existence should be reformed where necessary.
('85', 77, 1, 18, 144512) The kisans are for the most part illiterate.
('85', 77, 1, 19, 144557) Both adults and young persons of school going age should be educated.
('85', 77, 1, 20, 144627) This applies to men as well as women.
('85', 77, 1, 21, 144665) Where they are landless labourers their wages should be brought to a level that would ensure a decent living which should mean balanced food, dwelling houses and clothing, which should satisfy health requirements.
('85', 77, 1, 22, 144879) Land laws should be examined.
('85', 77, 1, 23, 144909) The peasant indebtedness offers a limitless field for research.
('85', 77, 1, 24, 144973) The problem of cattle too is an integral part of agriculture in India and therefore requires the attention of workers skilled in this very intricate and somewhat baffling problem.
('85', 77, 1, 25, 145153) Closely allied to the kisan work is labour.
('85', 77, 1, 26, 145197) Here labour means industrial labour and, therefore, concentrated and centralized and
('85', 77, 2, 27, 145282) 1 Vide Constructive Programme: Its Meaning and Place; 13 12 1941. 2 ibid

('85', 78, 1, 2, 145397) much more limited in scope.
('85', 78, 1, 3, 145425) Moreover, it lends itself readily to political handling; being necessarily confined to the cities it attracts workers more easily than kisan work.
('85', 78, 1, 4, 145572) As part of constructive programme its primary aim is elevation of labour to its deserved status.
('85', 78, 1, 5, 145669) Therefore a labour workers aim should be to raise the moral and intellectual height of labour and thus by sheer merit to make him or her capable not merely of bettering his or her material condition but making labour master of the means of production instead of being the slave that it is.
('85', 78, 1, 6, 145959) Capital should be labours servant, not its master.
('85', 78, 1, 7, 146010) Labour should be able to support itself during strikes.
('85', 78, 1, 8, 146066) (Labour should be taught the science of conducting a successful non violent Labour should be made conscious of its duty from whose performance rights follow as a matter of course.
('85', 78, 1, 9, 146246) In a concrete form: (a) Labour should have its own unions.
('85', 78, 1, 10, 146305) (b) Education, both general and scientific, of both men and women should be regularly undertaken through night schools.
('85', 78, 1, 11, 146425) (c) Children of labourers should be educated after the Basic Education style.
('85', 78, 1, 12, 146503) (d) There should be a hospital, a creche and a maternity home attached to every centre.
('85', 78, 1, 13, 146591) (e) Labour strike.) All the work I have mentioned could be only done through unions mentioned in (a).
('85', 78, 1, 14, 146693) To my knowledge the Ahmedabad Union is the best managed union.
('85', 78, 1, 15, 146756) This does not mean that it has reached my ideal.
('85', 78, 1, 16, 146805) It is trying to.
('85', 78, 1, 17, 146822) If all the unions worked in the same direction, the lot of labour would be infinitely better than it is today.
('85', 78, 1, 18, 146933) Labour united and morally and intellectually trained would any day be superior to capital.
('85', 78, 1, 19, 147024) 1 Next in importance is the student class above the age of 12. Indeed if we had enough workers of the right type, I would go so far as to say that we should work among them as soon as they begin learning as infants.
('85', 78, 1, 20, 147240) For they have to be taken in hand from the school going age.
('85', 78, 1, 21, 147301) Indeed, I need not say that I have not in mind their political use.
('85', 78, 1, 22, 147369) For the present the schools are largely under Government control or are influenced by them.
('85', 78, 1, 23, 147461) Hence the students education is defective in a vital matter.
('85', 78, 1, 24, 147522) They are untouched by the political condition of the country save what they learn from the newspapers or platform orators.
('85', 78, 1, 25, 147645) They should have in a systematic

('85', 79, 1, 2, 147777) manner their present education supplemented by Congress workers.
('85', 79, 1, 3, 147842) How this can be fitted into the present system of education is a serious question.
('85', 79, 1, 4, 147925) But it has to be tackled.
('85', 79, 1, 5, 147951) Up to the matriculation standard co operation of parents is necessary.
('85', 79, 1, 6, 148022) I adhere to the view often expressed by me that the student world should be aloof from the political turmoil.
('85', 79, 1, 7, 148132) It would be different if there was mass civil disobedience.
('85', 79, 1, 8, 148192) But at any rate for the time being that is out of the question.
('85', 79, 1, 9, 148256) But they should have education in national consciousness.
('85', 79, 1, 10, 148314) It is the duty of an independent State to teach its citizens to be patriotic.
('85', 79, 1, 11, 148392) The education is imparted by a foreign agency.
('85', 79, 1, 12, 148439) It runs contrary to the national aspirations.
('85', 79, 1, 13, 148485) There should, therefore, be a body of workers whose duty it would be to undertake the big task of taking in hand the work mentioned above.
('85', 79, 1, 14, 148624) In this sense it is a new field and it is of vital importance to us.
('85', 79, 1, 15, 148693) We must recognize the fact that the students are not to be weaned from schools and colleges.
('85', 79, 1, 16, 148786) The rapidly increasing number of entrants is proof positive of it.
('85', 79, 1, 17, 148853) The best course, therefore, is to supplement their studies in an orderly manner.
('85', 79, 1, 18, 148934) Deliverance lies through national effort in this direction showing marked superiority over the foreign method.

('85', 81, 3, 9, 151734) That may happen.
('85', 81, 3, 10, 151751) I do not want it.
('85', 81, 3, 11, 151769) But I would face that risk if the upshot of living a conscious life of truth and non violence for over half a century is that India, too, has to go through a blood bath.

('85', 81, 3, 13, 152116) One has ceaselessly to be on the march body and soul.
('85', 81, 3, 14, 152170) My business is to stir up myself and my surroundings and shake us out of our complacency.
('85', 81, 4, 15, 152260) What reason had he to think that his fast would compel the people to think instead of paralysing their thinking?
('85', 81, 5, 16, 152373) While it might be presumptuous on the part of a puny individual like himself to think, he replied, that his fast would galvanize the people, it was his faith that he had not striven all those years in vain to live a life of truth and non violence, that gave him the right to speak through his fast.
('85', 81, 5, 17, 152672) Today millions are experiencing the pangs of hunger in passive helplessness.
('85', 81, 5, 18, 152749) Even a small fraction of this suffering undergone willingly and with knowledge could change the face of the situation.
('85', 81, 5, 19, 152868) How can I speak to these millions, or identify myself with them, without [under]taking this fast and knowing myself what pangs of hunger mean?
('85', 81, 6, 20, 153011) He could not point to any single thing in explanation of his urge to fast, he said, but the whole situation in its totality overwhelmed him.
('85', 81, 6, 21, 153152) The friends were not satisfied.
('85', 81, 6, 22, 153184) What guarantee was there that if anything happened to him as while you are there in the flesh to control it? the friends returned to the charge.
('85', 81, 6, 23, 153329) Because I do not want anarchy or chaos.
('85', 81, 6, 24, 153369) I must work for orderliness, not anarchy.
('85', 81, 6, 25, 153411) But if in that attempt anarchy comes in my way, I would not be deterred by it.
('85', 81, 6, 26, 153490) The world is thrilled by the reckless bravery of the Japanese.
('85', 81, 6, 27, 153553) Far greater courage and bravery are expected of non violence at this juncture if the law of the Jungle is to be replaced by the law of love.

('85', 82, 2, 3, 153815) WARDHA, October 23, 1944
('85', 82, 3, 4, 153840) Mr. Horniman 1 thoughtfully sent the following wire to Mr. Pyarelal on the 19th:
('85', 82, 4, 5, 153921) Can you confirm or deny the Allahabad report that Gandhiji is contemplating a fast to achieve communal unity?
('85', 82, 4, 6, 154031) Pyarelal sent the following reply:
('85', 82, 5, 7, 154066) Thanks.
('85', 82, 5, 8, 154074) Report without foundation.
('85', 82, 5, 9, 154101) The reply is accurate, in that I do not contemplate any fast to achieve communal unity or any particular end.
('85', 82, 5, 10, 154211) Yet the reply is not complete.
('85', 82, 5, 11, 154242) Ever since my premature discharge, I have been saying to myself and some friends that yet another fast is in store for me.
('85', 82, 5, 12, 154365) Of late what was vaguely felt has been taking a concrete shape, and so I have been sharing the feeling with a larger circle of friends.
('85', 82, 5, 13, 154501) The report has now crept into the Press.
('85', 82, 5, 14, 154542) It is as well for the public, therefore, to have a correct version of the talks I have been having with friends.
('85', 82, 5, 15, 154655) Fasting has a definite place in the scheme of satyagraha.
('85', 82, 5, 16, 154713) It is the last weapon in the armoury of non violence.
('85', 82, 5, 17, 154767) It is taken by way of penance, purification, protest.
('85', 82, 5, 18, 154821) If I am at fault, I must do penance.
('85', 82, 5, 19, 154858) My non violence rebels against the organized violence that surrounds me.
('85', 82, 5, 20, 154931) It takes many shapes.
('85', 82, 5, 21, 154953) Lying is as much violence as doing physical harm to a person.
('85', 82, 5, 22, 155015) I do not here refer only to the violence of the rulers.
('85', 82, 5, 23, 155071) I know this, that non violence has to be most active in the face of what may seem to be invincible violence.
('85', 82, 5, 24, 155180) But nothing is clear, nothing is certain.
('85', 82, 5, 25, 155222) What seems to me to be a call may be no call at all.
('85', 82, 5, 26, 155275) I am, therefore, testing myself, discussing the pros and cons with friends, and allowing myself to be acted upon.
('85', 82, 5, 27, 155389) I have never made fasting a fad.
('85', 82, 5, 28, 155422) I have never looked forward to it and yet it has often brought solace to the agonized soul, for real fasting puts the soul in tune with the Maker.
('85', 82, 5, 29, 155569) It puts life into ones prayer.
('85', 82, 5, 30, 155600) All the while, I am discussing the feeling with friends.
('85', 82, 5, 31, 155657) I am praying for light and guidance, without

('85', 83, 8, 22, 156699) You are needlessly alarmed.
('85', 83, 8, 23, 156727) There is no question of my doing anything.
('85', 83, 8, 24, 156770) However, Bapa and you may try to convince me that I have done nothing wrong.
('85', 83, 8, 25, 156847) For my part, I see my error clearly enough.
('85', 83, 8, 26, 156891) But I will be glad if it can be proved an illusion.
('85', 83, 8, 27, 156943) May not your sensitive heart be the cause of the repeated set backs in your health?

('85', 88, 5, 12, 162745) October 25, 1944
('85', 88, 6, 13, 162762) DEAR SIR TEJ, The Press cuttings on the breakdown of the talks 2 between Quaid e Azam Jinnah and me show that for the most part the criticism is unhelpful and in some cases even regrettable.
('85', 88, 6, 14, 162953) In the circumstances if a representative conference is held it might prove profitable.
('85', 88, 6, 15, 163040) Anyway it can do no harm.
('85', 88, 6, 16, 163066) No one is better able than your good self to take the lead in this matter.
('85', 88, 6, 17, 163141) 3 This conference should confine itself to an examination of the Pakistan issue in the light of the
('85', 88, 7, 18, 163241) 1 This was sent through Dr. Beni Prasad.
('85', 88, 7, 19, 163282) 2 Which were held from September 9 to September 27, 1944 3 In his letter dated October 14,1944, the addressee had written: Mrs. Pandit conveyed to me your message about the possibility of my calling a conference.
('85', 88, 7, 20, 163495) I have for a long time been thinking over it and I have come to the conclusion that not only have I no locus standi to call such a conference but that such a conference will not do any good.
('85', 88, 7, 21, 163686) In the first place I doubt very much whether Mr. Jinnah or the Hindu Sabha men will make any response as they can very easily dispose of me by saying that I have got no goods to deliver and I have got no party behind me.
('85', 88, 7, 22, 163907) Secondlyand this is more importantI fear that in a conference like this where people will be actuated by party feeling and will be afraid of criticism from their own following if they take an independent line, no solid results can be achieved and indeed what I fear is that our differences will come to the surface.
('85', 88, 7, 23, 164223) It is for this reason that I think that if you and Mr. Jinnah can appoint such a committee and that committee can submit a report, it may pave the way for a larger conference at that stage.
('85', 88, 7, 24, 164413) I am, therefore, definitely of the opinion that a conference should not be called at this stage.

('85', 89, 5, 9, 164826) About sadhana do as I have suggested.
('85', 89, 5, 10, 164864) Valjibhai 2 is here and he also says that he has checked up everything with Indian Opinion.
('85', 89, 5, 11, 164956) My information therefore must be correct.
('85', 89, 5, 12, 164998) You will however not be able to render me any personal service.
('85', 89, 5, 13, 165062) Besides the sword of a fast is hanging over my head.
('85', 89, 5, 14, 165115) I cannot say when the Ashram will go to pieces.
('85', 89, 5, 15, 165163) Hence, I think it is best for you to continue to work among the Baraiyas 3. I am convinced about what you say regarding education.
('85', 89, 5, 16, 165294) They should therefore have the training that is offered at present.

('85', 90, 5, 11, 166514) SEVAGRAM, October 26, 1944 The unbearable forces of injustice, exploitation and falsehood prevailing in this country and the world stifle me.
('85', 90, 5, 12, 166656) Government subsists on falsehood, but amongst us the number of people, who subsist on this falsehood and who have made injustice and exploitation the principles of their lives, is not small.
('85', 90, 5, 13, 166847) In the presence of this, good elements of life are entirely suppressed and appear helpless.
('85', 90, 5, 14, 166939) There is nothing left like moral public opinion.
('85', 90, 5, 15, 166988) On the one hand, there is a combination of violence effected on an unprecedented scale while, on the other, I have laid a claim that non violence has strength enough to oppose any amount of well organized and banded violence, and how to achieve it is the question.
('85', 90, 5, 16, 167253) There are too good elements in India and the world, but how to awaken them?
('85', 90, 5, 17, 167329) How can it be done?
('85', 90, 5, 18, 167349) Fast is the last resort of satyagraha.
('85', 90, 5, 19, 167388) When people cannot be made to do anything it is the right of a lone satyagrahi to resort to this final measure.
('85', 90, 5, 20, 167500) If my fast comes about it is possible that it will be the complaining voice of the exploited humanity before the world.
('85', 90, 6, 21, 167620) 1 The addressee had broken down while taking a walk alone.
('85', 90, 6, 22, 167679) 2 Daughter of Mohanlal Nayyar 3 The report in Gujarati was released to the Press by Mridula Sarabhai but subsequently she withdrew it on being informed that Gandhiji intended to issue a statement on the subject, which however is not available.
('85', 90, 6, 23, 167923) While sending this translation to the Home Department, the Deputy Director of the Intelligence Bureau inter alia wrote: These notes are of interest as they furnish some indications of the working of Gandhis mind.
('85', 91, 0, 1, 168136) 92 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('85', 91, 1, 2, 168177) Those who can foresee the possibility of mass movement, against the prevailing falsehood, they are at liberty to do it.
('85', 91, 1, 3, 168297) But the individual or the individuals who do it must shoulder its complete responsibility.
('85', 91, 1, 4, 168388) I cannot give my blessings to it.
('85', 91, 1, 5, 168422) Today, the circumstances are not favourable for it.
('85', 91, 1, 6, 168474) Besides, the public is full of resentment, and therefore the mass satyagraha would result in violence.
('85', 91, 1, 7, 168577) Our little violence will be met by hundredfold violence by Government.
('85', 91, 1, 8, 168648) We should not expect merciful treatment from them.
('85', 91, 1, 9, 168699) This does not mean that we should be a mute spectator of it, or that we should continue to suffer it.
('85', 91, 1, 10, 168801) Those who consider the present condition as oppressive, and find the laws encouraging injustice and exploitation and depriving of ones liberty, they can definitely resort to satyagraha.
('85', 91, 1, 11, 168987) Only that it should be done individually and it should not be devoid of politeness.
('85', 91, 1, 12, 169071) It can only be done with absolute non violence.
('85', 91, 1, 13, 169119) There are good many forces contained in it.
('85', 91, 1, 14, 169163) If a crore of people were to do individual satyagraha it would baffle Government.
('85', 91, 1, 15, 169245) Then Government would either be helpless or resort to use of guns.
('85', 91, 1, 16, 169312) You cannot sit silent after saying that individual satyagraha can be offered.
('85', 91, 1, 17, 169390) It is ones duty to do it.
('85', 91, 1, 18, 169416) If the public has any stamina, it can oppose thus the looting going on under its nose.
('85', 91, 1, 19, 169503) Leaving aside the question of a crore of people, if all (local) people do so at one place, it is enough.
('85', 91, 1, 20, 169608) If individual satyagraha is not approved, the prevailing falsehood of the present day should be opposed in any other way.
('85', 91, 1, 21, 169730) Today our own people are depriving the public of their food grains.
('85', 91, 1, 22, 169798) If they do not do it, people will not starve.
('85', 91, 1, 23, 169844) The cultivator, who produces food, does not get it to eat in spite of its being there.
('85', 91, 1, 24, 169931) We have no political power, otherwise its remedy would have been found.
('85', 91, 1, 25, 170003) This condition is terrible.
('85', 91, 1, 26, 170031) I cannot tolerate our people behaving thus, and collecting vast fortunes at the cost of peoples starvation.
('85', 91, 1, 27, 170139) If we can rid our people of falsehood and roguery, Governments falsehood cannot work.
('85', 91, 1, 28, 170225) Let us remove the corruption prevailing everywhere.
('85', 91, 1, 29, 170277) It is already there in the Government, but it has increased to a very great extent among those middlemen who live on brokerage.
('85', 91, 1, 30, 170405) If these people improve by themselves, others would do so.
('85', 91, 1, 31, 170464) Today the chain of violence is made up thus.
('85', 91, 1, 32, 170509) Against this we have to work non violently.
('85', 91, 1, 33, 170553) Fast is the last weapon of non violence.
('85', 91, 1, 34, 170594) CorruptionIt is both in the Government and other quarters.
('85', 91, 1, 35, 170653) If non Governmental corruption stops, the Government corruption
('85', 92, 0, 1, 170717) VOL.85 : 2 OCTOBER, 1944 3 MARCH, 1945 93
('85', 92, 1, 2, 170759) cannot go on.
('85', 92, 1, 3, 170773) Non violence has to bring about the union of good elements.
('85', 92, 1, 4, 170833) Violence brings about unity among wicked elements.
('85', 92, 1, 5, 170884) This is the first exhibition of violence.
('85', 92, 1, 6, 170926) The second is untouchability.
('85', 92, 1, 7, 170956) Hindu religion must understand that it is a sin.
('85', 92, 1, 8, 171005) If untouchability endures, Hindu religion will not survive.
('85', 92, 1, 9, 171065) If the former is removed, the latter is safe.
('85', 92, 1, 10, 171111) In the removal of untouchability and in trying to live as brethren Government cannot interfere.
('85', 92, 1, 11, 171207) The third exhibition is communal bitterness.
('85', 92, 1, 12, 171252) Political settlement may be effected or not.
('85', 92, 1, 13, 171297) As long as the present Government remains, it will not be possible; it would not be allowed.
('85', 92, 1, 14, 171390) But we can develop good relations between us.
('85', 92, 1, 15, 171436) We should not give any cause of complaint with regard to matters which are in our hands.
('85', 92, 1, 16, 171525) The conduct of Congressmen in Allahabad Municipality has grieved me much.
('85', 92, 1, 17, 171599) In short, we should develop good relations amongst us in the removal of untouchability and securing communal unity.
('85', 92, 1, 18, 171715) Government cannot interfere in such attempts.
('85', 92, 1, 19, 171761) Refer to the supplementary note to the previous suggestions on the constructive programme and ponder over them.
('85', 92, 1, 20, 171873) The meaning of your turning to me every moment for small things is that you do not want to use your intelligence.
('85', 92, 1, 21, 171987) Everyone should be his leader.
('85', 92, 1, 22, 172018) No harm if you commit a mistake.
('85', 92, 1, 23, 172051) I shall point it out.
('85', 92, 1, 24, 172073) You mend it and it should be considered as atonement.
('85', 92, 1, 25, 172127) By making mistakes we shall find the real path.
('85', 92, 1, 26, 172175) This does not mean that I would not guide you.
('85', 92, 1, 27, 172222) As long as I can do so, I shall continue to do it.
('85', 92, 2, 28, 172273) When Gandhiji was requested to take the public into confidence with regard to all that is troubling his mind and to postpone his fast until then, he said: I am neither in a hurry for the fast nor have a desire for it, but I think I will have to undertake it.
('85', 92, 2, 29, 172532) I neither know the time nor the duration of the fast.
('85', 92, 2, 30, 172586) I am trying to check that idea.
('85', 92, 2, 31, 172618) How could I be a mute witness of the terrible looting and falsehood going on in India and the world?
('85', 92, 2, 32, 172719) Then, what should I do?
('85', 92, 2, 33, 172743) Should I start mass satyagraha?
('85', 92, 2, 34, 172775) Or a revolution?
('85', 92, 2, 35, 172792) That is possible.
('85', 92, 2, 36, 172810) I can bring it about.
('85', 92, 2, 37, 172832) But I do not want to do it.
('85', 92, 2, 38, 172860) Non violence cannot remain in it.
('85', 92, 2, 39, 172894) I will not take that risk.
('85', 92, 2, 40, 172921) There is no atmosphere for it.
('85', 92, 2, 41, 172952) I can foresee it.
('85', 92, 2, 42, 172970) Therefore the satyagrahi has only one weapon left and it is the fast.
('85', 92, 2, 43, 173040) If I can move my forces thereby, I would do so.
('85', 92, 2, 44, 173088) But nothing is certain yet.
('85', 92, 2, 45, 173116) No decision has been taken on this fast question.
('85', 92, 2, 46, 173166) Every time the public knew it after the decision was taken.
('85', 92, 2, 47, 173226) This time I have been putting it
('85', 93, 0, 1, 173259) 94 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

('85', 93, 1, 3, 173408) If they and the public desire, they might contribute towards its prevention by lessening its causes.

('85', 93, 3, 6, 173569) 122. DISCUSSION WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF HINDUSTANI TALIMI SANGH
('85', 93, 4, 7, 173633) SEVAGRAM, [Before October 27, 1944] 1
('85', 93, 5, 8, 173671) The first question that arose was one bearing on the suggestion that the word basic education might be incorporated in the Trust Deed, so as to make it clear to all concerned that the education contemplated under the Fund 2 would be only of the basic type.
('85', 93, 5, 9, 173928) Gandhiji did not approve of it.
('85', 93, 5, 10, 173960) He did not wish to put any restraint upon the trustees.
('85', 93, 5, 11, 174016) If any unit did not want to adopt basic education, he would leave it free to follow any other system approved by the Board.
('85', 93, 5, 12, 174140) But the Talimi Sangh should have the confidence that no one will be able to find a better system than theirs.
('85', 93, 6, 13, 174250) Basic education would forge ahead through its intrinsic merit.
('85', 93, 6, 14, 174313) He knew that the reform would not come by mere argumentation.
('85', 93, 6, 15, 174375) It would come by ocular demonstration.
('85', 93, 6, 16, 174414) If they could carry their experiment to a successful end even in one village, the battle would be half won.
('85', 93, 6, 17, 174522) He was, therefore, content to go slow.
('85', 93, 6, 18, 174561) It was enough that the trustees had agreed to the money being spent for the education and welfare of women and children in the villages exclusively.
('85', 93, 6, 19, 174710) Your work is going chiefly to be among women.
('85', 93, 6, 20, 174756) I have always had a passion to serve womankind.
('85', 93, 6, 21, 174804) Ever since my arrival in India, the women have recognized in me their friend and servant.
('85', 93, 6, 22, 174894) They have come to look upon me as one of themselves.
('85', 93, 6, 23, 174947) I hold radical views about the emancipation of women from their fetters which they mistake for adornment.
('85', 93, 6, 24, 175053) If God wills it, I hope one day to place some of my conclusions before the public when my researches are completed.
('85', 93, 6, 25, 175169) My experience has confirmed me in the view that real advancement of women can come only by and through their own efforts.
('85', 93, 6, 26, 175291) I am, therefore, anxious that as many women workers as possible should be inspired to carry out the Talimi Sangh activities under the Trust.
('85', 93, 7, 27, 175432) The second suggestion put forth by the Talimi Sangh was that the age of the
('85', 93, 8, 28, 175508) 1 The report, date lined Wardha, October 27, 1944, mentions this discussion as having taken place recently.
('85', 93, 8, 29, 175616) 2 Kasturba Gandhi National Memorial Fund
('85', 94, 0, 1, 175657) VOL.85 : 2 OCTOBER, 1944 3 MARCH, 1945 95
('85', 94, 1, 2, 175699) boys to be covered by the scheme should be raised from 7 to 12.
('85', 94, 2, 3, 175763) Mahatma Gandhi explained why he had agreed to the reduction of the age limit for boys from 12 to 7 years.
('85', 94, 2, 4, 175869) It had been brought to his notice that, if there were equal facilities for the education of boys and girls, the mothers would send the boys to school but not the girls, as they would be loath to spare them from domestic work.
('85', 94, 2, 5, 176095) The result would be that the boys would get a disproportionate share of the benefit and keep out the girls.
('85', 94, 2, 6, 176203) But if in any place a sufficient number of girls was not forthcoming, they could take in boys above the age of seven, on condition that they would have to make room for the girls as soon as the latter came up and that their education was paid for.
('85', 94, 2, 7, 176451) The object was not to shut out boys above seven, but to prevent them from being a burden upon the Memorial Fund.
('85', 94, 2, 8, 176564) The Talimi Sangh should not fall back upon the Fund designed for women.
('85', 94, 2, 9, 176636) All that he was concerned about was that the money of the Kasturba Fund should not be diverted to the use of boys over seven at the expense of girls.
('85', 94, 3, 10, 176786) Is it desirable that there should be basic schools for girls exclusively if there was not enough room for both? somebody asked.
('85', 94, 3, 11, 176914) Mahatma Gandhi said he had no objection.
('85', 94, 3, 12, 176955) Supposing crores of boys come to us for education, are we to refuse them for lack of accommodation?
('85', 94, 3, 13, 177055) I tell you I wont.
('85', 94, 3, 14, 177074) I will let them sit under the shade of a tree, if necessary, put bamboo taklis into their hands and begin to educate them straightway through these.
('85', 94, 4, 15, 177223) As to adult education, Gandhiji observed that it had become clear to him that the scope of basic education had to be extended.
('85', 94, 4, 16, 177350) It should include the education of everybody at every stage of life.
('85', 94, 5, 17, 177419) A basic school teacher must consider himself a universal teacher.
('85', 94, 5, 18, 177485) As soon as he comes in contact with anybody, man or woman, young or old, he should say to himself: Now, what can I give to this person?
('85', 94, 6, 19, 177621) Wont that be supererogation on his part?
('85', 94, 6, 20, 177662) Supposing I come across an old man who is dirty and ignorant.
('85', 94, 6, 21, 177724) His village is his universe.
('85', 94, 6, 22, 177753) It would be my job to teach him cleanliness, to remove his ignorance and widen his mental horizon.
('85', 94, 6, 23, 177852) I need not tell him that I am to be his teacher.
('85', 94, 6, 24, 177901) I will try to establish a living contact with his mind and win his confidence.
('85', 94, 6, 25, 177980) He may reject my
('85', 94, 7, 26, 177997) 1 Earlier, talking to a friend, Gandhiji had said he had been thinking hard during his detention over the possibilities of the new education.
('85', 94, 7, 27, 178139) His mind had become restive.
('85', 94, 7, 28, 178168) He said: We must not rest content with our present achievements, we must penetrate the homes of the children, we must educate their parents; basic education must become literally education for life.
('85', 95, 0, 1, 178367) 96 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('85', 95, 1, 2, 178408) advances.
('85', 95, 1, 3, 178418) I wont accept defeat, but continue my effort till I succeed in making friends with him.
('85', 95, 1, 4, 178506) Once that is achieved, the rest must follow.
('85', 95, 1, 5, 178551) Again, I must have my eye on the children right from their birth.
('85', 95, 1, 6, 178617) I will go a step further and say that the work of the educationist begins even before that.
('85', 95, 1, 7, 178709) For instance, if a woman becomes pregnant, Ashadevi will go to her and tell her: I am a mother as you will be.
('85', 95, 1, 8, 178820) I can tell you from my experience what you should do to ensure the health of your unborn baby and your own. She will tell the husband what his duty towards his wife is and about his share in the care of their expected baby.
('85', 95, 1, 9, 179044) Thus the basic school teacher will cover the entire span of life.
('85', 95, 1, 10, 179110) Naturally, his activity will cover adult education.
('85', 95, 1, 11, 179162) Some work for adult education is being done in many places.
('85', 95, 1, 12, 179222) It is mostly concentrated among mill hands and the like in big cities.
('85', 95, 1, 13, 179293) No one has really touched the village.
('85', 95, 1, 14, 179332) Mere three Rs and lectures on politics wont satisfy me.
('85', 95, 1, 15, 179388) Adult education of my conception must make men and women better citizens all round.
('85', 95, 1, 16, 179472) To work out the syllabus and to organize the work of adult education is a more difficult task than preparation of the seven years course for children.
('85', 95, 1, 17, 179623) The common central feature of both will be the imparting of education through village crafts.
('85', 95, 1, 18, 179717) Agriculture will play an important part in adult education under the basic scheme.
('85', 95, 1, 19, 179800) Literary instruction must be there.Much information will be given orally.
('85', 95, 1, 20, 179874) There will be books more for the teachers than the taught.
('85', 95, 1, 21, 179933) We must teach the majority how to behave towards the minority and vice versa.
('85', 95, 1, 22, 180011) The right type of adult education should teach good neighbourliness and cut at the very root of untouchability and communal problem.
('85', 95, 1, 23, 180144) The particular industry which is to serve as the medium of instruction will be determined by local conditions in each place.
('85', 95, 1, 24, 180269) For instance, people in a village might tell you that they are interested in agriculture, but they are not interested in the spinning wheel.
('85', 95, 1, 25, 180410) In that case, you will choose the former as the medium of instruction.
('85', 95, 1, 26, 180481) You could make a beginning by taking a census of its cattle.
('85', 95, 1, 27, 180542) For instance, I find that almost everyone in Sevagram has a bullock and a bullock cart.
('85', 95, 1, 28, 180630) It seems wasteful.
('85', 95, 1, 29, 180649) The villagers should be taught co operation.
('85', 95, 1, 30, 180694) Again, we must inculcate in them the right principles of relationship between men and women.
('85', 95, 1, 31, 180787) Men get almost double the womens wages for identical work.
('85', 95, 1, 32, 180846) Sometimes men sit lazily at home and smoke while the women toil the whole day.
('85', 95, 1, 33, 180925) People should be

('85', 96, 1, 3, 181043) If you agree with me that the scope of basic education should be extended, you might have to change your constitution.

('85', 96, 5, 13, 181603) If you get her co operation, you two, otherwise you alone with the help of anybody whom you select, should go on working silently.
('85', 96, 5, 14, 181734) Consult me whenever necessary.
('85', 96, 5, 15, 181765) Everybody must be assigned his or her share of the work, and I should be informed about the arrangement.
('85', 96, 5, 16, 181870) Only those who can become one with the life in this village may stay here, others should leave and go where they like.
('85', 96, 5, 17, 181989) I will help them in that.

('85', 96, 10, 23, 182304) 2 If a fast is ordained for me, it is best that the wedding should be over before that time.

('85', 97, 11, 19, 183732) Think deeply over what I said yesterday.
('85', 97, 11, 20, 183773) This is what I say: unsteadiness of mind implies impurity of thought, it cannot be regarded as brahmacharya.
('85', 97, 11, 21, 183882) This is quite usual in youth, but he who aspires to be a brahmachari will grow steadier day by day.
('85', 97, 11, 22, 183982) Discuss this matter with Balkoba 2 or reach a conclusion by looking within yourself.

('85', 98, 2, 8, 184749) It shows your inadequate understanding.
('85', 98, 2, 9, 184789) I have spoiled nothing by setting up here the Khadi Vidyalaya, etc.
('85', 98, 2, 10, 184857) The organizations initially started by me had to work in close association with me.
('85', 98, 2, 11, 184941) If the people engaged in them could not live together as a family, then whose fault is it?
('85', 98, 2, 12, 185032) Maybe, the fault is his who sees it.

('85', 98, 2, 14, 185152) It is my belief that we have lost nothing by being truthful.
('85', 98, 2, 15, 185213) Again, after todays heart searching we have lost nothing.
('85', 98, 2, 16, 185271) We were in a slumber but now we are awake.
('85', 98, 2, 17, 185314) It is clear from what happened yesterday that it would not be right for us to continue as we have been doing.
('85', 98, 2, 18, 185424) Those who can be of greater service outside should certainly go.
('85', 98, 2, 19, 185489) What benefit can one derive from being near to me if one fails to understand my actions and the changes I make?
('85', 98, 2, 20, 185601) No doubt a fire bucket is a very useful thing but how can one become like a fire bucket just by using it as an illustration?
('85', 98, 2, 21, 185726) If you wish to be like a fire bucket then be quiet, be humble and be a sort of comfort for all, and do it after proper deliberation.
('85', 98, 2, 22, 185859) Continue the study of Sanskrit.
('85', 98, 2, 23, 185891) Your first task is to correct the wrong notions you have expressed in your letter.

('85', 102, 5, 14, 190101) I have been able to draft the letter only today.
('85', 102, 5, 15, 190150) I have not talked to Bapa, because my letter as usual, should have your approval.
('85', 102, 5, 16, 190232) If you do not like this draft, you may make one yourself which I can then place before Bapa.
('85', 102, 5, 17, 190325) If he refuses to sign it, I am willing to look into your complaint.
('85', 102, 6, 18, 190393) Blessings from BAPU [Draft] Bapu tells me that you insist on an open enquiry concerning my attitude towards you, or a letter of apology from me.
('85', 102, 6, 19, 190538) I know that I am quick tempered.
('85', 102, 6, 20, 190571) I have no complaints about your work.
('85', 102, 6, 21, 190609) but I hold that even though you are my co secretary, you are still under my control.
('85', 102, 6, 22, 190694) Such being my position, whenever you have opposed me, I have become impatient and lost my temper.
('85', 102, 6, 23, 190792) I know I ought not to lose my temper.
('85', 102, 6, 24, 190830) But I am an ordinary human being.
('85', 102, 6, 25, 190864) You should forgive me.
('85', 102, 6, 26, 190887) I hope you will.
('85', 102, 6, 27, 190904) You are free to publish this letter of apology whenever you wish.

('85', 103, 2, 3, 191378) October 29, 1944
('85', 103, 3, 4, 191395) My heart is heavily grieved by the injustice, exploitation and falsehood prevailing and increasing, day by day, in the world.
('85', 103, 3, 5, 191521) The best remedy for it is to awaken the good elements in the whole world.
('85', 103, 3, 6, 191595) Collective civil disobedience is the way for it, but it is not possible today.
('85', 103, 3, 7, 191674) It is very likely that such collective activity will result in violence.
('85', 103, 3, 8, 191747) If we are able to avoid unofficial falsehood and injustice, Government falsehood and injustice will be no more.
('85', 103, 3, 9, 191859) I feel I must do penance by fasting.
('85', 103, 3, 10, 191896) I am asked not to go on fast.
('85', 103, 3, 11, 191926) I do not know when and for what duration it will come but let me say that the way to avoid the fast is in the peoples hands.
('85', 103, 3, 12, 192051) I desire destruction of exploitation, injustice and falsehood.
('85', 103, 3, 13, 192114) If they are destroyed my fast will be unnecessary.
('85', 103, 3, 14, 192165) As a satyagrahi I cannot be a silent spectator of all these things.
('85', 103, 3, 15, 192233) Revolution or collective civil disobedience is not possible and hence I must move on my wheels of non violence through the fast.
('85', 103, 3, 16, 192362) I have expressed my views to someone today.
('85', 103, 3, 17, 192406) I express them to the whole country.
('85', 103, 3, 18, 192443) People can give their contribution in the work which I intend to do.
('85', 103, 3, 19, 192512) I cannot see people starve.
('85', 103, 3, 20, 192540) Their rights are snatched by others.
('85', 103, 3, 21, 192577) Nobody must do this.
('85', 103, 3, 22, 192598) We must avoid falsehood and badmashi.
('85', 103, 3, 23, 192636) We can improve those working as middlemen and thus lessen the burden upon the people.
('85', 103, 3, 24, 192722) Activities of exploitation are in full swing and have become unbearable.
('85', 103, 3, 25, 192795) Government stands firm and is maintaining its position on falsehood.
('85', 103, 3, 26, 192864) But injustice and the policy of exploitation among the people too cannot be ignored 2.

('85', 104, 4, 5, 193345) Your letter of the 25th July has been lying in Gandhijis file all this time.
('85', 104, 4, 6, 193422) He is very sorry he could not reply to it earlier.
('85', 104, 4, 7, 193473) He wanted to send you a helpful reply.
('85', 104, 4, 8, 193512) I am now to say that he is very sorry he does not know what help he can render in the matter.

('85', 105, 2, 3, 194336) October 29, 1944
('85', 105, 3, 4, 194353) I have read your letter.
('85', 105, 3, 5, 194378) Yes, you can take out what you want from my writings.
('85', 105, 3, 6, 194432) This work is good but you must do a lot of physical work.
('85', 105, 3, 7, 194490) It is very harmful to keep thinking of Vidya and go on weeping.
('85', 105, 3, 8, 194554) That remembrance is good which elevates the atman and awakens it.
('85', 105, 3, 9, 194620) The nature of atman is sat (truth) chit (awareness from heart, duly experienced) and ananda (bliss).
('85', 105, 3, 10, 194721) The test of both lies in blissthe inner bliss which finds outward expression.
('85', 105, 3, 11, 194799) If you do not get peace here it would be better to go to Andhradesha early.
('85', 105, 3, 12, 194875) I believe there you will get satsanga and treatment as well.

('85', 105, 7, 17, 195091) October 29, 1944
('85', 105, 8, 18, 195108) RANGA, You say that the earth rightly belongs or should belong to the peasant 2. By this, do you mean only that the peasant ought to gain control over the land he cultivates or that he should also gain effective voice and power in the society and over the State in which he is obliged to live?
('85', 105, 8, 19, 195402) If the kisans are to have only land and not effective political power, their position will be just as bad as in Soviet Russia where political power has been monopolized by the proletarian dictatorship while peasants were first allowed to gain some holdings and later were deprived of those
('85', 105, 9, 20, 195692) 1 The report of this and the other interview with N. G. Ranga on November 28, 1944, was released to the Press by Pyarelal with the following note: Soon after his release from prison Prof.
('85', 105, 9, 21, 195880) Ranga saw Gandhiji at Sevagram.
('85', 105, 9, 22, 195912) He had two interviews with him on 29th October, 1944 and 28th November, 1944. It was understood on both sides that the interviews were not for publication.
('85', 105, 9, 23, 196068) As, however, parts of those interviews have already appeared in the Press, I am, under Gandhijis instructions, releasing to the Press my full notes of the talks. At the first interview Prof.
('85', 105, 9, 24, 196259) Ranga presented Gandhiji with a lengthy written questionnaire.

('85', 106, 1, 2, 196464) holdings in the name of collectivization of land.
('85', 106, 2, 3, 196514) GANDHIJI: I do not know what has happened in Soviet Russia.
('85', 106, 2, 4, 196574) But I have no doubt that if we have democratic swaraj, as it must be if freedom is won through non violence, the kisan must hold power in all its phases including political power.
('85', 106, 3, 5, 196754) Am I right in interpreting your statement that land should not belong to the absentee landlord or zamindar and that ultimately the zamindari system has to be abolished, of course through non violent means?
('85', 106, 3, 6, 196960) But you should remember that I visualize a system of trusteeship regulated by the State.
('85', 106, 3, 7, 197049) In other words I do not want to antagonize the zamindars (and for that matter any class) without cause.
('85', 106, 4, 8, 197153) When you say that a peasant has so to work as to make it impossible for the landlord to exploit him does it include, apart from the satyagrahic campaigns and the legislative and administrative reforms, that the peasants may oblige the State through the exercise of their franchise and political influence to improve their individual and collective conditions and minimize the powers of the landlords?
('85', 106, 4, 9, 197554) Civil disobedience and non co operation are designed for use when people, i.e., the tillers of the soil, have no political power.
('85', 106, 4, 10, 197684) But immediately they have political power, naturally their grievances, whatever their character, will be ameliorated through legislative channels.
('85', 106, 4, 11, 197831) But he might not have all that political power, you will perhaps say.
('85', 106, 4, 12, 197901) My reply is that if swaraj is attained by the effort of the whole people, as it must be under non violence, the kisans must come into their own and have the uppermost voice.
('85', 106, 4, 13, 198075) But if it is not so and there is a sort of a workable compromise between the people and the Government on the basis of a limited franchise, the interests of the tiller of the soil will need close watching.
('85', 106, 4, 14, 198281) If the legislature proves itself to be incapable of safeguarding kisans interests they will of course always have the sovereign remedy of civil disobedience and non co operation.
('85', 106, 4, 15, 198460) But as I said as early as in 1921 1 in connection with Chirala Perala, ultimately, it is not paper legislation nor brave words or fiery speeches, but the power of non violent organization, discipline and sacrifice that constitutes the real bulwark of the people against

('85', 107, 1, 2, 198827) injustice or oppression.
('85', 107, 2, 3, 198852) You suggest that the existing kisan organizations should be reformed where necessary.
('85', 107, 2, 4, 198938) I quite recognize the need for Congressmen who have been working among kisans to re orientate the general political attitude of the kisan class organizations so that they will recognize the need for a united political leadership for winning our national freedom.
('85', 107, 2, 5, 199201) I am also convinced that the National Congress provides for us allespecially for peasantsthe most effective weapon and leadership to win freedom.
('85', 107, 2, 6, 199347) But is there any harm if we organize peasants into a Kisan Congress which accepts the political leadership of the Congress?
('85', 107, 2, 7, 199471) There may be gross self deception in this presentation.
('85', 107, 2, 8, 199527) When I said that the Kisan Sabhas should be reformed, I meant that up till now Kisan Sabhas have been formed not to wrest power from the Government, but to capture the Congress.
('85', 107, 2, 9, 199705) That applies to the student and labour organizations too.
('85', 107, 3, 10, 199763) You are partially right.
('85', 107, 3, 11, 199788) That was so in the past.
('85', 107, 3, 12, 199813) But we have now completely abandoned that idea.
('85', 107, 3, 13, 199861) Since you made your statement on the subject in 1938 1 the thing was completely given up.
('85', 107, 3, 14, 199951) We have adopted the word Congress not in a spirit of rivalry but because we want to be identified with the Congress.
('85', 107, 3, 15, 200068) We will have double membership.
('85', 107, 3, 16, 200100) Every member of the Kisan Congress will also be enrolled as a member of the National Congress.
('85', 107, 3, 17, 200195) Then why not run the Congress?
('85', 107, 3, 18, 200226) Why set up an independent and parallel organization?
('85', 107, 3, 19, 200279) Dont you see when Kisan Sabhas are bona fide organizations they are the Congress?
('85', 107, 3, 20, 200361) Today only a fraction of Indias population is represented on the Congress register.
('85', 107, 3, 21, 200445) The Congress aspires to represent the whole nation.
('85', 107, 3, 22, 200497) It claims by right of service to speak even for those who are not on its register.
('85', 107, 3, 23, 200580) When it becomes a fully national organization, de jure as it is today by moral right, the bulk of its membership will naturally consist of the kisans and they will be in a position to dictate its policy.
('85', 107, 4, 24, 200784) The trouble is that some of our Congress colleagues think we are ousting them from their legitimate position of power and privilege.
('85', 107, 4, 25, 200917) They may not be prepared to welcome our existence or trust our bona fides.
('85', 107, 4, 26, 200992) We want to avoid conflicts within the Congress by willingly accepting the political leadership of the Congress.
('85', 107, 4, 27, 201104) For executing our economic programme we want to have a separate class conscious organization which will derive power both for itself and the Congress from its

('85', 108, 1, 3, 201406) Unless we do that, others will come and confuse the kisans.
('85', 108, 1, 4, 201466) Here you have involved yourself in a fallacy.
('85', 108, 1, 5, 201512) You should work to make the Congress fully representative of the kisans.
('85', 108, 1, 6, 201585) Unless we get down to this fundamental thing and work from bottom upward, there will be no swaraj.
('85', 108, 1, 7, 201684) Every Congressman must make up his mind to make the Congress an honest organization, and therefore a kisan organization.
('85', 108, 1, 8, 201805) As for rights they should follow as a natural corollary from the performance of service.
('85', 108, 1, 9, 201894) Otherwise, there is only usurpation.
('85', 108, 2, 10, 201931) You have tried for the last twenty five years to rebuild the Congress organization and you know the result.
('85', 108, 2, 11, 202039) I along with others must plead guilty for my share in the responsibility for failure.
('85', 108, 2, 12, 202125) I must confess we have not got the confidence that we shall be able to so behave and act that the Congress will in the end become a kisan organization.
('85', 108, 2, 13, 202277) Our fear is that by following your line of action in spite of ourselves, we shall allow ourselves to be exploited by vested interests.
('85', 108, 2, 14, 202412) The very fact that the Birlas and their like are today prepared to give you shelter and you accept it from them prevents radical reform.
('85', 108, 2, 15, 202549) Therefore, though I shall feel the wrench, I shall feel unable to work on your lines.
('85', 108, 2, 16, 202635) Then you admit that whilst you will work under the aegis of the Congress, you will at the same time run a parallel, independent organization.
('85', 108, 2, 17, 202777) My mind runs in a straight line.
('85', 108, 2, 18, 202810) I do not understand this zigzag.
('85', 108, 2, 19, 202843) This can only lead to trouble when the Congress becomes an effective organization.
('85', 108, 2, 20, 202926) I am thinking of the millions of our downtrodden countrymen who do not know what to hope and what not to hope.
('85', 108, 2, 21, 203037) A parallel organization will only further confuse their minds.
('85', 108, 2, 22, 203100) It would be more logical to keep out of the Congress altogether.
('85', 108, 3, 23, 203165) We enter the Congress, but we do not fight for position and power.
('85', 108, 3, 24, 203232) Can you not treat us on the same footing as the Ahmedabad Labour Union?
('85', 108, 3, 25, 203304) Well, the proof of the pudding is in the eating.
('85', 108, 3, 26, 203353) It will all depend on the spirit in which it is done.
('85', 108, 3, 27, 203407) I have already expressed my apprehension.
('85', 108, 3, 28, 203449) It is for you to remove it.
('85', 108, 3, 29, 203477) You can model your organization after the Ahmedabad Labour Union.
('85', 108, 3, 30, 203543) All the Labour Union members are on the Congress register.
('85', 108, 3, 31, 203602) They are under the discipline of the Congress.
('85', 108, 3, 32, 203649) Yet they are a power in the Congress and in the Municipality.
('85', 108, 3, 33, 203711) You should confine yourself to Andhra alone.
('85', 108, 3, 34, 203756) All kisans should be automatically on your register.
('85', 108, 3, 35, 203809) But the purpose of enrolment should be educative, to make the kisans Congress minded and politically conscious.

('85', 109, 1, 2, 203963) I am glad you are laying special stress on adequate wages which will assure a minimum and decent standard of living for the landless peasants.
('85', 109, 1, 3, 204106) Do you not also recognize the need for achieving minimum prices for agricultural produce which will assure labouring proprietors a decent and minimum standard of living?
('85', 109, 1, 4, 204276) Of course I do.
('85', 109, 2, 5, 204292) The Bombay A. I. C. C. Resolution assures the masses that the power in the national Government and swaraj India ought to belong to the toilers on the fields, in the factories and elsewhere.
('85', 109, 2, 6, 204482) 1 Can we say that the spirit of the Resolution means that the Congress therefore stands for the achievement of democratic kisan mazdoor praja raj after the attainment of swaraj?
('85', 109, 2, 7, 204660) Not only after but before also.
('85', 109, 2, 8, 204692) The Congress stands for democratic kisan mazdoor praja raj.
('85', 109, 3, 9, 204752) Do not your new instructions envisage the development of kisan organizations from the village upwards, to provide for peasant leadership and co operative action, but working in harmony with the local National Congress Committee and their leadership?
('85', 109, 3, 10, 205002) I may say that the Haripura session 2 of the Congress has recognized the right of kisans to have their own class organizations.
('85', 109, 3, 11, 205130) But we are anxious, in the light of these four years experience, that Congressmen shall take the lead in organizing kisans into their own unions so that there can be real unity and co operation between kisan organizations and Congress Committees.
('85', 109, 3, 12, 205377) Kisan organization and Congress organization are to me convertible terms.
('85', 109, 3, 13, 205451) National Congress organizations to be true have either to be kisan organizations or nothing else.
('85', 109, 4, 14, 205549) Can we organize landless agricultural labour into their separate unions wherever there are workers to undertake such responsibilities in order to win for them the barest economic and social justice?
('85', 109, 4, 15, 205748) I do not envisage such unions in rivalry with the local peasant unions but as a supplement to them.
('85', 109, 4, 16, 205848) Yes, but as part of Congress reorganization work.
('85', 109, 5, 17, 205898) Your instructions do not specifically mention the need for awakening and organizing the Hill Tribes and people of backward areas known as the Excluded or Partially Excluded Areas.
('85', 109, 5, 18, 206078) These people number easily thirty million all over India and they are subject to many disabilities and they need our help very badly.
('85', 109, 5, 19, 206212) May we take it that Congressmen have to spare their energies to organize these people into their unions?
('85', 109, 5, 20, 206317) Certainly.
('85', 109, 5, 21, 206328) The aboriginal is as backward as the Harijan and more neglected.
('85', 109, 5, 22, 206393) He calls for all the humanitarian service that

('85', 110, 1, 2, 206570) Congressmen are capable of.
('85', 110, 1, 3, 206598) Unfortunately very few Congressmen have taken to it.
('85', 110, 2, 4, 206651) Can our peasants and their organizations undertake satyagraha campaigns against any oppressive measures or policies of a landlord or a revenue authority, i.e., after all possibilities for settlement by negotiations through the good offices of the local Congress Committees have failed?
('85', 110, 2, 5, 206937) We are aware of the 1939 Bombay A. I. C. C. instructions 1 regarding such campaigns and we accept that when there is a National Government with which the Congress co operates, peasants unions as well as local committees have to seek the guidance of the Provincial Congress Committees as to when and how to start and conduct such satyagraha campaigns.
('85', 110, 2, 6, 207288) They would be fools if they did not do that.
('85', 110, 3, 7, 207333) What flag do you recommend for peasant unions and handloom weavers unions and such other unions which agree to accept the National Congress leadership?
('85', 110, 3, 8, 207485) I may inform you that we have decided to drop the Red Flag and adopt the National Flag, with the typical class or professional emblem such as the plough or the loom placed in one corner in addition to the charkha which occupies already the central place.
('85', 110, 3, 9, 207740) I dont mind.
('85', 110, 3, 10, 207753) To differentiate you can have your class emblem by the side of the national emblem.
('85', 110, 4, 11, 207837) Do you not recognize the need for all the colonial peoples to try to come nearer to each other, learn from each others experience in their fight for freedom and help each other?
('85', 110, 4, 12, 208015) Colonial people is a badly chosen expression, oppressed races of the earth expresses the idea better.
('85', 110, 4, 13, 208117) Colonial in the English language means whites who have migrated to the Colonies.
('85', 110, 5, 14, 208198) Are we right in thinking that your stand against world imperialism is intended to benefit as much the African, Chinese, Red Indians and other non white masses as the 400 millions of India?
('85', 110, 5, 15, 208387) My correspondence with the Government while under detention shows that most clearly.
('85', 110, 6, 16, 208472) May we have your blessings for our attempt to build up the Colonial Peoples Freedom Front and thus develop a research, propaganda and ideological platform with merely advisory and informative functions?
('85', 110, 6, 17, 208675) I may inform you that several of our friends and your admirers in England, Africa and the West Indies, such as Mr. Reginald Reynolds, Miss Stock Kenyatta, Mr. George Padmore, have already been working on your lines for the emancipation of the colonial and coloured peoples.

('85', 111, 1, 2, 209034) I want to say Yes.
('85', 111, 1, 3, 209053) But I want to understand its implications.
('85', 111, 2, 4, 209096) The greatest social problem of the modern world is the exploitation of the vast masses of agricultural people by the industrial peoples and countries through the unequal exchanges imposed upon the former by the latter through their control over the world markets and finance and imperialist machinery.
('85', 111, 2, 5, 209398) Are we right in thinking that you stand for the abolition of this process of exploitation of the producers of primary commodities and the agricultural masses of the world?
('85', 111, 2, 6, 209570) Root and branch.
('85', 111, 3, 7, 209587) Are we right in thinking that ours is only a part of the general struggle of colonial peoples against world capitalism and imperialism and that India is the vanguard in the world movement of colonial and agricultural masses for freedom, economic and political?
('85', 111, 3, 8, 209848) I hope so.
('85', 111, 4, 9, 209859) Is it not our duty to allow Congressmen to join and work in local food councils and such other quasi official organizations now that every detail of a persons life has come within the price controls, grain procurement and requisition and acquisition and rationing activities of Government, provided we feel satisfied that we can render some effective help to our masses or prevent mischief?
('85', 111, 4, 10, 210250) They ought to be allowed if they can do without loss of initiative and independence and can really render effective help.
('85', 111, 4, 11, 210372) What shall those peasants do whose Gandhi Irwin salt privileges have been unjustly withdrawn or curtailed?
('85', 111, 4, 12, 210479) They should take the salt if it comes within the clause.
('85', 111, 4, 13, 210536) Do you not recognize the need for students and their Students Congress to understand, popularize and act upon the ideology of the I.N.C. consistently with their responsibilities as students?
('85', 111, 4, 14, 210727) Of course they should study and understand all that.

('85', 118, 8, 14, 218523) Shri A. V. Thakkar in a letter dated 16.10.1944 writes to me as follows :
('85', 118, 9, 15, 218597) Bapu had transferred Rs. 2,000/ to Shri Haribhau Phatak for Harijan work.
('85', 118, 9, 16, 218671) But no work seems to have been done so far.
('85', 118, 9, 17, 218715) A lot of correspondence has been passing between Shri Phatak and Shri Barve of Dhulia, the President of the Maharashtra Sangh.
('85', 118, 9, 18, 218842) The main point of contention seems to be that Shri Phatak would not agree to realize Rs. 3/ or Re.
('85', 118, 9, 19, 218941) 1/ from the Members of the Committee as required by the Constitution of the Sangh.
('85', 118, 10, 20, 219024) Gandhiji has desired me to draw your attention to it.

('85', 121, 1, 2, 222240) In reply to another question whether sufficient number of Harijan members could be co opted to the Harijan Sevak Sangh so as to form a Harijan majority, Gandhiji said: No.
('85', 121, 1, 3, 222412) It is a body of those who want to undergo prayashchitta 1 and this must be done by the caste Hindus only.
('85', 121, 1, 4, 222518) The touchables should serve the untouchables and the latter should accept the services of the former.
('85', 121, 2, 5, 222620) To the question when untouchability would be removed, Gandhiji said: Perhaps both of us may not live to see it.
('85', 121, 2, 6, 222732) But it is my firm conviction that untouchability will have to go if the Hindu religion is to live.

('85', 122, 7, 17, 224116) If on the earlier occasion it was that of the God of Truth, so will it be this time, too.

('85', 122, 7, 19, 224249) After declaring my intention to fast, I am examining myself.
('85', 122, 7, 20, 224310) If any argument against the fast convinces me beyond the shadow of a doubt, I would give up my intention, but if ultimately I get a clear call from the God of Truth, nobody will be able to dissuade me.

('85', 125, 7, 19, 228534) She wants that either you should bless her marriage to the boy of her choice, or, if that is not possible, you should never force her to marry anybody else.
('85', 125, 7, 20, 228691) I think you can have no objection to this.

('85', 126, 3, 5, 229085) I am not at all angry, my only consideration is my duty towards you.
('85', 126, 3, 6, 229154) I cannot share the financial responsibility.
('85', 126, 3, 7, 229199) Submit your budget to Jajuji.
('85', 126, 3, 8, 229229) You are sure to get the amount he sanctions.
('85', 126, 3, 9, 229274) It is not proper to trouble Bari Khan 2 for your expenses.
('85', 126, 3, 10, 229333) It would be better if you can get them from another brother, otherwise take them from the Ashram.
('85', 126, 3, 11, 229431) There is always a place for you in the Ashram, and positively so in my absence.
('85', 126, 3, 12, 229511) You should give up building castles in the air.

('85', 126, 7, 18, 229800) I like your ideas.
('85', 126, 7, 19, 229819) It would be better to carry on the work under a single authority.
('85', 126, 7, 20, 229885) I had once (before August 1942) made an unsuccessful attempt.
('85', 126, 7, 21, 229947) I am going to try again.
('85', 126, 7, 22, 229972) What was wrong in Bhai Amritlal writing a reply to you?
('85', 126, 7, 23, 230028) It was his effort at saving me the trouble.
('85', 126, 7, 24, 230072) The work that he is doing is for putting into practice Kakasahebs ideas.
('85', 126, 7, 25, 230145) Like you he does his work regarding it as his dharma.
('85', 126, 7, 26, 230199) The only difference is that I do not know you, whereas I know him well.
('85', 126, 7, 27, 230271) Why cant you all work in unison although you work independently?
('85', 126, 7, 28, 230336) From your letter I see that there is some difference between your way of thinking and mine.
('85', 126, 7, 29, 230428) I shall not discuss the point here as I dont have the time.
('85', 126, 7, 30, 230488) Tandonji 4 is likely to come here.

('85', 127, 2, 7, 231248) Negative non co operation is meant to achieve that end.
('85', 127, 2, 8, 231304) The example of Christian missionaries would not help because the way to realizing God as Truth is different.
('85', 127, 2, 9, 231413) I cannot describe that way.

('85', 127, 5, 23, 232026) All I wish is that you should have all that is to be gained there and come here when your time is up, and be worthy of your country.
('85', 127, 5, 24, 232159) I dont know whether I shall survive to see you.
('85', 127, 5, 25, 232207) And what does it avail to know about it beforehand?

('85', 129, 3, 4, 233633) DEAR SIR TEJ BAHADUR This is written in a hurry.
('85', 129, 4, 5, 233682) I suggest not a tentative public statement but a personal letter to a few representatives asking whether they favour the idea of calling a conference.
('85', 129, 4, 6, 233833) I have in mind not a centre but a board composed of representatives of the two States regulating matters of common concern and enforcing the treaty obligations.
('85', 129, 4, 7, 233994) The conference will meet to consider the causes of the failure of the talks, to find whose fault it was and to suggest an independent solution, if any.
('85', 129, 4, 8, 234146) It will inform and educate public opinion.
('85', 129, 4, 9, 234189) Thus there is no fear of failure unless the conference does not come to a unanimous decision or one tantamount to it.
('85', 129, 5, 10, 234307) You must keep well.

('85', 130, 10, 23, 236520) The influence of a university should travel beyond its four walls.
('85', 130, 10, 24, 236587) Religion should be a binding, not a disruptive force.

('85', 138, 12, 16, 247534) For this it is essential that those who are learning Hindustani acquire familiarity with the Devanagari and Persian scripts.
('85', 138, 12, 17, 247659) It is therefore the duty of this Sabha to get the right textbooks published and arrange examinati198ons in order to be able to certify that one knows both the scripts and can read and write Hindustani.
('85', 138, 12, 18, 247861) The Working Committee should lay down details regarding the curriculum and the examinations.

('85', 140, 7, 21, 250601) I am not going to worry you to come early.
('85', 140, 7, 22, 250644) You must not strain yourself even to come to Nagpur 1. You may even send your address or depute someone to read it for you.
('85', 140, 7, 23, 250768) If however you do come to Nagpur you will give yourself a few days for Sevagram, or Wardha whichever suits you best.

('85', 141, 5, 9, 251604) There is nothing particularly wrong with your health.
('85', 141, 5, 10, 251658) You have spoiled your health by over exertion and worry.
('85', 141, 5, 11, 251715) You ought to utilize your knowledge for the benefit of your own health.
('85', 141, 5, 12, 251787) Englishmen are not philosophers, but they keep themselves free from worry so as to preserve their health and for the sake of their health they never let any external trouble overcome them.
('85', 141, 5, 13, 251976) You have such capacity.
('85', 141, 5, 14, 252000) Stop worrying about me and about other matters.

('85', 141, 10, 23, 252319) [Before November 9, 1944] If everyone stuck to his dharma and did his duty why should I have to fast?
('85', 141, 10, 24, 252421) And how would God permit it?
('85', 141, 10, 25, 252450) But if people become unsettled and remain inactive the fast will not be stopped.
('85', 141, 10, 26, 252531) So long as I can work otherwise, there is no possibility of my resorting to a fast.
('85', 141, 10, 27, 252615) When there is no work for me or no work which can be taken from me, then alone will God ask me to go on a fast.
('85', 141, 11, 28, 252727) 1 Gulzarilal Nanda, Secretary of the Ahmedabad Textile Labour Association, had conveyed Gandhijis words to the Associations organ, Majoor Sandesh, in his letter from Wardha dated November 9, 1944.

('85', 142, 1, 3, 253012) Not that I should start a fast right away.
('85', 142, 1, 4, 253055) But when God bids me no one can prevent me from undertaking the fast.
('85', 142, 1, 5, 253125) Pray to God that I may not have to fast.
('85', 142, 1, 6, 253166) Prayer is the only thing that matters.
('85', 142, 1, 7, 253205) To do sincere work in the name of God is itself prayer.
('85', 142, 1, 8, 253261) I say what I feel.
('85', 142, 1, 9, 253280) There is not only one thing that disturbs me today, there are several.
('85', 142, 1, 10, 253351) I have only mentioned the thing that most perturbs me.
('85', 142, 1, 11, 253406) If something else comes up, I shall not hesitate to say it.
('85', 142, 1, 12, 253466) These have little to do with Congressmen.
('85', 142, 1, 13, 253508) People today are engaged in fraud, black marketing and amassing of wealth somehow.
('85', 142, 1, 14, 253591) There is no end to the lies they mouth.
('85', 142, 1, 15, 253631) Who can change their hearts?
('85', 142, 1, 16, 253660) I do not know whether my fast will do so.
('85', 142, 1, 17, 253702) I can only pray.
('85', 142, 1, 18, 253719) Gods will be done.
('85', 142, 1, 19, 253738) Nobody knows today what is going to happen.
('85', 142, 1, 20, 253782) If everyone does his duty it is possible that the fast will not come off.
('85', 142, 1, 21, 253856) One man cannot assume the whole burden, but the concerted effort of many people may bear fruit.
('85', 142, 1, 22, 253952) Let everyone calmly do his work without being despondent or becoming agitated.
('85', 142, 1, 23, 254031) This is all I ask for.
('85', 142, 1, 24, 254054) God too will want no more.

('85', 143, 12, 17, 255372) November 9, 1944 1. Obviously it is obligatory for a member of the Sabha to fulfil at any rate the condition laid down by you.
('85', 143, 12, 18, 255499) The objective of the Sabha is clearly stated in its constitution.
('85', 143, 12, 19, 255565) I do wish, however, that all Indians learn both the scripts and speak a language which could be understood by both Hindus and Muslims.
('85', 143, 12, 20, 255700) 2. The Hindi style and the Urdu style are like the Ganga and the Yamuna.
('85', 143, 12, 21, 255773) Hindustani is like the Saraswati.
('85', 143, 12, 22, 255807) It is concealed and yet not concealed.
('85', 143, 12, 23, 255846) The Sabha should endeavour to make it clearly discernible.
('85', 143, 13, 24, 255905) 1 Secretary, Hindustani Prachar Sabha, Wardha.
('85', 143, 13, 25, 255952) This note was in reply to the following questions: (1) It appears that, in 1942, when the Hindustani Prachar Sabha was formed, you intended and directed your efforts that persons enrolling themselves as members
('85', 144, 0, 1, 256163) VOL.85 : 2 OCTOBER, 1944 3 MARCH, 1945 145
('85', 144, 1, 2, 256206) 3. Hindustani Prachar Sabha will be complementary of both and will seek help from both.
('85', 144, 1, 3, 256294) But its work will be distinct from theirs, which could also be regarded as the same.
('85', 144, 1, 4, 256379) If the Sabha tried to undo the work of these two organizations, its own objective would be defeated.
('85', 144, 1, 5, 256480) How can you have Saraswati without the confluence [of the three]?
('85', 144, 1, 6, 256546) 4. The work of the Sabha will be, and should be, uniform all over the country.
('85', 144, 1, 7, 256625) The procedure may be modified here and there to suit the differing needs of the provinces.
('85', 144, 1, 8, 256716) 5. The new movement of the Hindustani Prachar Sabha should not create difficulties in the work of Rashtrabhasha Prachar Samiti, if the two co ordinate their activities.

('85', 144, 4, 11, 256941) Courtesy: Pyarelal
('85', 144, 6, 12, 256960) of the Hindustani Prachar Sabha must learn both the scripts of the Rashtrabhasha.
('85', 144, 6, 13, 257042) Do you, even today, expect that thing only from the members, or do you want that everybody, both old and young in the country, must learn both the scripts?
('85', 144, 6, 14, 257198) (2) Regarding the plan of work of Hindustani Prachar Sabha, some people understand that the Sabha aims at propagating both Hindi and Urdu but there are others who say that it aims at propagating neither Hindi nor Urdu but Hindustani.
('85', 144, 6, 15, 257432) In 1942, you were of opinion that the Saraswati in the shape of Hindustani had not yet made its appearance.
('85', 144, 6, 16, 257540) Is the situation different at present?
('85', 144, 6, 17, 257579) What is it that the Sabha will propagate if Hindustani has not yet made its appearance?
('85', 144, 6, 18, 257667) (3) Under the auspices of the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan a number of institutions are working for the propagation of Hindi and the Devanagari script, and the Anjuman Taraqqi e Urdu for that of Urdu and the Persian script.
('85', 144, 6, 19, 257885) Will the Hindustani Prachar Sabha be merely co ordinating the activities of these two institutions or will it be complementary of the two?
('85', 144, 6, 20, 258024) Or will it be a third body pursuing its own programme undoing the work of these two?
('85', 144, 6, 21, 258109) (4) Will the policy and programme of the Hindustani Prachar Sabha with respect to South India and the non Hindi provinces be the same as in the other provincesthat is, will the propagation of both the scripts be obligatory?
('85', 144, 6, 22, 258333) (5) Will the new policy of the Hindustani Prachar Sabha create difficulties in continuing the propagation of Rashtrabhasha as it is being carried on in South India and the other non Hindi provinces for the last so many years?

('85', 149, 1, 5, 264106) (2) There was no question of my refusal to have a Harijan on the executive of the Harijan Sevak Sangh.
('85', 149, 1, 6, 264209) As a matter of fact there are Harijans on the Central Board as well as its branches.
('85', 149, 1, 7, 264294) But I am opposed on principle to such appointments for the Sangh is formed of a body of caste Hindu penitents who are vowed to eradicate untouchability.
('85', 149, 1, 8, 264447) It is therefore a debtors association.
('85', 149, 1, 9, 264486) Harijans are creditors.
('85', 149, 1, 10, 264510) I expressed this opinion to a body of Harijans who recently interviewed me.

('85', 161, 10, 19, 277509) DEAR SARDAR DURLAB SINGH 2, This is my answer to your questions: 3
('85', 161, 11, 20, 277576) (1) My association with Rajaji in his formula 4 could not affect the Sikh position in the slightest degree, even if Quaid e Azam Jinnah accepted it.
('85', 161, 11, 21, 277725) The Lahore Resolution 5 of the Congress referred to by you stands.
('85', 161, 11, 22, 277792) The result of Quaid e Azam Jinnahs acceptance would have been that both of us would have gone to the Sikhs and others

('85', 162, 1, 2, 278228) interested to secure their acceptance.
('85', 162, 1, 3, 278267) I had made this clear in my letter 1 to Masterjee.
('85', 162, 1, 4, 278318) (2) I cannot understand the Akali indignation.
('85', 162, 1, 5, 278365) My meeting a deputation was unnecessary in view of my absolute assurance.
('85', 162, 1, 6, 278439) If Masterjee had wanted to bring his friends to me, in spite of my assurance, I would have gladly seen them as I did other friends who sought clarification from me.
('85', 162, 1, 7, 278604) (3) Maulana Saheb explained the implications of the Jagat Narain Lals Resolution 2 which please see.
('85', 162, 1, 8, 278705) But supposing that it is inconsistent with the Rajaji Formula and the Congress accepts the latter, there is nothing to prevent the Congress from rescinding the Resolution.
('85', 162, 1, 9, 278877) (4) How could I favour a contrary opinion when I have always given the closest collaboration to Sikh friends?
('85', 162, 1, 10, 278987) Those Sikhs, who do not accept the Congress creed, naturally refrain, like many others, from joining the Congress.
('85', 162, 1, 11, 279102) (5) I know nothing about the Sikandar 3 Baldev Singh Pact, much less about the Congress High Commands association with it.
('85', 162, 1, 12, 279225) Nor do I know the details of the Azad Punjab scheme.
('85', 162, 1, 13, 279278) I could never be guilty of blessing anything which is con trary to the national interest.
('85', 162, 1, 14, 279368) You can certainly have the assurance that the interests of the nationalist Sikhs, as also of all nationalists, are safe in my hands, also, I presume, in the Congress hands, though as you know I have no authority to speak on behalf of the Congress.
('85', 162, 1, 15, 279616) There are many inventions about me going the round.
('85', 162, 1, 16, 279668) I would warn friends against giving credence to any of them without reference to me.

('85', 173, 5, 17, 292719) You must have seen his reply to Rajajis wire.
('85', 173, 5, 18, 292765) He does not propose to make any public statement with regard to the Congress reorganization work as suggested by you.
('85', 173, 5, 19, 292883) He has favoured the formation of ad hoc unions of Congress workers for carrying out normal Congress work.
('85', 173, 5, 20, 292989) Dont you think that in these matters ad hoc committees should be free to frame their own rules and shape their policy according to local circumstances in the best possible manner they can ?
('85', 173, 5, 21, 293179) This does not involve any constitutional point.
('85', 173, 5, 22, 293227) All those who accept the policy and plan of work laid down by these bodies and abide by their discipline would of course be entitled to join these bodies.

('85', 174, 3, 5, 293725) Labour has made great strides in Ahmedabad.
('85', 174, 3, 6, 293769) But much remains yet to be done.
('85', 174, 3, 7, 293802) I cannot be satisfied till the respect for labour rises higher than that for capital, nor should labour be satisfied.
('85', 174, 3, 8, 293920) We will not attain that position till it has attained unity, 100 per cent honesty and education with knowledge.

('85', 175, 6, 11, 295417) I am not very keen just now to start a maternity hospital here.
('85', 175, 6, 12, 295481) Since Sushila will not devote all her time to this work I am thinking what her position in this project should be.

('85', 175, 6, 14, 295678) Sushila believes that with the time she will give, she can do justice both to the local maternity home and the Committee.
('85', 175, 6, 15, 295800) She should have a doctor under her to attend to the needs of the maternity home.
('85', 175, 6, 16, 295881) If you wish you may discuss the matter with her.
('85', 175, 6, 17, 295930) I have told Abid Ali that he should obtain an estimate of expenditure but should not incur any expenditure just now.

('85', 178, 6, 7, 299138) BHAI OMKARNATH, I read your statement fully.
('85', 178, 6, 8, 299183) Till this point I wrote in Hindi either inadvertently or because I was possessed by Hindi.
('85', 178, 6, 9, 299274) Why is your statement in English?
('85', 178, 6, 10, 299308) Your language too does not follow the English usage and hence sounds out of tune.
('85', 178, 6, 11, 299390) Very few among us have a perfect command over English.
('85', 178, 6, 12, 299445) And why must we?
('85', 178, 6, 13, 299462) When we cannot do without it we may scribble some kind of English to express our thoughts.
('85', 178, 6, 14, 299553) You want to place your thoughts before the Indian people.
('85', 178, 6, 15, 299611) They should therefore be either in Gujarati (your mother tongue) or Hindi (the national language).
('85', 178, 6, 16, 299710) This was only a point to note.
('85', 178, 6, 17, 299741) What have you to do with a charter?
('85', 178, 6, 18, 299777) Your own merit deserves to be your writ.
('85', 178, 6, 19, 299818) Certainly, you dont need State patronage.

('85', 179, 7, 13, 300938) I was glad to listen to the detailed news from Ahmedabad that you gave me.
('85', 179, 7, 14, 301013) But you know how greedy I am.
('85', 179, 7, 15, 301043) I shall be satisfied only if Ahmedabad helps me realize my dream, that is, if untouchability goes root and branch, men and women practise abstention as a matter of dharma and attain equality, the inequality between the rich and the labourers is removed, drink and gambling are stopped, all wear nothing but pure khadi whether at home or outdoors, ideal cleanliness of the heart as well as in outer life is observed and no one suffers hunger.
('85', 179, 7, 16, 301485) Do whatever you can out of this and persuade others to do so.
('85', 179, 7, 17, 301547) 3 What more shall I say?
('85', 179, 7, 18, 301572) Come again.

('85', 180, 3, 4, 301987) BHAISHRI DIWAN, I was pleased to read your letter.
('85', 180, 3, 5, 302038) You have not yet regained your full strength.
('85', 180, 3, 6, 302084) I dont like it.
('85', 180, 3, 7, 302100) Do the doctors and the vaids have no remedy?
('85', 180, 3, 8, 302145) Or is it that you are lax in your observance of the rules of hygiene?
('85', 180, 3, 9, 302215) True, my asking you this question may sound like the pot calling the kettle black, but it is not quite that.
('85', 180, 3, 10, 302324) No doubt, you must miss Babubhai at every step.
('85', 180, 3, 11, 302372) I had regarded you two as inseparable.
('85', 180, 3, 12, 302411) But he has left us all behind and gone ahead.
('85', 180, 3, 13, 302457) Herewith the reply to your student.
('85', 180, 3, 14, 302493) 1 Read it and tell him what you think right.

('85', 181, 3, 4, 302852) SURYAKANT PARIKH, The sincerity of your letter is unmistakable.
('85', 181, 3, 5, 302916) The leaders who are in jail are doing their duty by being there.
('85', 181, 3, 6, 302981) A satyagrahi in prison never rots.
('85', 181, 3, 7, 303016) He serves his cause by his imprisonment, nor can anyone say with certainty that he could have served the cause better if he had remained outside.
('85', 181, 3, 8, 303162) But it is the duty of those who are outside not to forget those who are in prison.
('85', 181, 3, 9, 303245) They must labour to get them out.
('85', 181, 3, 10, 303279) If we had the requisite strength, many of our leaders should not be today in jail.
('85', 181, 3, 11, 303362) In its absence, we must strive with whatever measure of strength we may possess.
('85', 181, 3, 12, 303443) I, therefore, like the idea of students abstaining from going to school on 9th, provided they devote the whole day to self purification and service.
('85', 181, 3, 13, 303592) There should be strictest adherence to truth and ahimsa in whatever they do.
('85', 181, 3, 14, 303669) Mass civil disobedience is today in abeyance; rather, it was never started but the fight for independence shall go on so long as independence is not attained.
('85', 181, 3, 15, 303828) Whatever your decision let the bounds of propriety be not transgressed and let the decision be taken after due consultation with your teachers and school management.
('85', 181, 3, 16, 303994) Do not forget that yours is not a Government school.
('85', 181, 3, 17, 304047) You must also remember what I have said in another place about the duties of students.

('85', 181, 5, 19, 304217) 1 The addressee, a student of the Proprietary High School, Ahmedabad, had written to Gandhiji on behalf of the School Committee asking how the 9th of each month was to be observed.
('85', 181, 5, 20, 304398) Since Gandhiji was receiving a large number of similar enquiries especially from students and incomplete extracts from this letter had appeared in the Press, this authorized translation was released to the Press on January 19, 1945. 2 The date, superscription, subscription and the address are from the Gujarati in Pyarelal Papers.

('85', 182, 1, 2, 304773) 283. SPEECH AT ALL INDIA TEACHERS TRAINING CAMP 1
('85', 182, 2, 3, 304823) SEVAGRAM, November 19, 1944
('85', 182, 3, 4, 304851) At the request of Shrimati Ashadevi, Gandhiji delivered a short address to them on the 19th instant, to explain the meaning of New Education.
('85', 182, 3, 5, 304993) He described in a few words how the Basic Education scheme was born.
('85', 182, 3, 6, 305062) In 1937 when the Congress took up power for a short term, as it afterwards turned out, in seven out of the eleven Provinces they were confronted with the question of popular education.
('85', 182, 3, 7, 305247) His advice was sought.
('85', 182, 3, 8, 305270) Like many others, he had been dissatisfied with the present system of education.
('85', 182, 3, 9, 305351) He felt that if education was to be linked with the living needs of the masses inhabiting the villages of India, it ought to be imparted through a basic craft.
('85', 182, 3, 10, 305511) He had no practical experience of agriculture.
('85', 182, 3, 11, 305558) But he was saturated with the idea of the charkha which he had identified with village life.
('85', 182, 3, 12, 305651) He, therefore, suggested that it should be used as a medium for the childrens education.
('85', 182, 3, 13, 305740) The idea appealed to Shri Aryanayakum, Shrimati Ashadevi and Dr. Zakir Husain and through their effort the Hindustani Talimi Sangh was founded.
('85', 182, 4, 14, 305884) Originally this New Education was intended to cover only the first seven years of a childs education, viz., from the seventh to the fourteenth year.
('85', 182, 4, 15, 306033) The experiment had already completed six years and was now entering upon the seventh.
('85', 182, 4, 16, 306119) As a result of further thought, he had come to the conclusion that this education should cover the whole of life from the moment of conception to the moment of death.
('85', 182, 5, 17, 306286) Referring to the prayer which had been recited at the beginning of the proceedings, he observed: There are several things in this prayer which are worthy of your note but I want to draw your attention to that particular portion of it which pledged the reciter to adherence to Truth in speech and action under all circumstances and at all times.
('85', 182, 5, 18, 306631) One mantra means: Lead me from untruth to Truth, from darkness to Light, from death to Immortality. Similarly the Islamic prayer, which has just been recited is an outpouring of the soul for Light and for being guided on to the straight path of Truth and Righteousness.
('85', 182, 5, 19, 306901) This quest for Truth is the Alpha and Omega of all education.
('85', 182, 5, 20, 306963) After finishing your training here you will go back to your respective Provinces to propagate this New Education.
('85', 182, 5, 21, 307077) You will keep this ideal of devotion to Truth before you.
('85', 182, 5, 22, 307135) Your work will be that of pioneers.
('85', 182, 5, 23, 307171) There will be no one to help or guide you with his previous experience.
('85', 182, 5, 24, 307243) You shall have to grope your way all by yourselves.
('85', 182, 5, 25, 307295) It is, therefore, not an easy task that you have before you.
('85', 182, 5, 26, 307356) Then this New
('85', 182, 6, 27, 307370) 1 Organized by the Hindustani Talimi Sangh and attended by about 50 students, the camp was inaugurated by Gandhiji in the afternoon.
('85', 182, 6, 28, 307503) This is the authorized version of Gandhijis speech, presumably in Hindi.
('85', 183, 0, 1, 307576) 184 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('85', 183, 1, 2, 307618) Education will not help you to get big jobs carrying high salaries and emoluments.
('85', 183, 1, 3, 307701) But yours will be the privilege to go among and serve the villagers in their villages.
('85', 183, 1, 4, 307788) Palatial buildings and costly equipment can, therefore, have no place in your scheme of work.
('85', 183, 1, 5, 307882) The school of my conception is one where classes are held in the open under the shade of a tree.
('85', 183, 1, 6, 307979) I know that it cannot be realized at present.
('85', 183, 1, 7, 308025) Some shelter will be necessary, perhaps always for protection against the sun, wind and rain.
('85', 183, 1, 8, 308119) True education can only be given under conditions of utmost simplicity.
('85', 183, 2, 9, 308191) Pointing to the building in which they were assembled, he continued: All the buildings here in the Talimi Sangh are built of local material and with the help of local artisans.
('85', 183, 2, 10, 308368) We have thereby established a living link between ourselves and the people.
('85', 183, 2, 11, 308444) That by itself is an education for the people and constitutes the foundation of our future educational work.
('85', 183, 2, 12, 308553) If you thoroughly assimilate this ideal of simplicity and its importance in the New Education, you will have justified your training here.
('85', 183, 2, 13, 308692) You will then appreciate your work.
('85', 183, 2, 14, 308728) That work consists of cleaning up.
('85', 183, 2, 15, 308763) Cleanliness of the mind and body is the first step in education.
('85', 183, 2, 16, 308828) Prayer does for the purification of the mind what the bucket and the broom do for the cleaning up of your physical surroundings.
('85', 183, 2, 17, 308957) That is why we always commence our proceedings with prayer.
('85', 183, 2, 18, 309017) No matter whether the prayer we recite is the Hindu prayer or the Muslim or the Parsi, its function is essentially the same, namely, purification of the heart.
('85', 183, 2, 19, 309177) God has innumerable names but the most beautiful and suitable in my opinion is Truth.
('85', 183, 2, 20, 309263) Let Truth, therefore, rule every action of our life, be it ever so insignificant.
('85', 183, 2, 21, 309345) Let every morsel of food that we eat be sanctified with His name and consecrated to His service.
('85', 183, 2, 22, 309442) If we eat only to sustain the body as an instrument of His service not only will it make our bodies and minds healthy and clean, the inner cleanliness will be reflected in our surroundings also.
('85', 183, 2, 23, 309637) We must learn to make our latrines as clean as our kitchens.
('85', 183, 2, 24, 309698) As with the individual so with society.
('85', 183, 2, 25, 309738) A village is but a group of individuals and the world, as I see it, is one vast village and mankind one family.
('85', 183, 2, 26, 309850) The various functions in the human body have their parallel in the corporate life of society.
('85', 183, 2, 27, 309944) What I have said about the inner and outer cleanliness of the individual, therefore, applies to the whole society.
('85', 183, 2, 28, 310059) In the mighty world, man, considered as an animal, occupies but an insignificant place.
('85', 183, 2, 29, 310147) Physically, he is a contemptible worm.
('85', 183, 2, 30, 310186) But God has endowed him with intellect and the faculty of discrimination between good and evil.
('85', 183, 2, 31, 310282) If we use this faculty to know
('85', 184, 0, 1, 310313) VOL.85 : 2 OCTOBER, 1944 3 MARCH, 1945 185
('85', 184, 1, 2, 310356) God we become a power for good.
('85', 184, 1, 3, 310388) Abuse of that talent converts us into an instrument of evil, so that we become like a scourge and a plague and fill this earth with strife and bloodshed and unhappiness and misery.
('85', 184, 1, 4, 310569) The struggle between the forces of good and evil is ceaseless and eternal.
('85', 184, 1, 5, 310644) The former have truth and ahimsa as weapons against the letters falsehood, violence and brute force.
('85', 184, 1, 6, 310745) There is nothing more potent in the universe than Gods name.
('85', 184, 1, 7, 310806) If we enthrone Him in our hearts and keep Him there always, we shall know no fear and lay for ourselves rich treasure in life.

('85', 187, 8, 21, 314828) I do not see any point now in complying with the restrictions imposed by the Government.

('85', 189, 6, 15, 317124) I saw Vidyas mobile samadhi 1. It is good but I am inclined towards the simple and subtle.
('85', 189, 6, 16, 317215) Let it be if you get peace and solace from it.
('85', 189, 6, 17, 317262) It is also transient and if you can free yourself of attachment for it your love for Vidya will become further purified.
('85', 189, 6, 18, 317383) You will better understand Vidyas true nature and your oneness will become clearer.
('85', 189, 6, 19, 317467) A photograph shows difference.
('85', 189, 6, 20, 317498) By identifying yourself with the unmanifest Vidya, that is with her spirit, non difference can be attained.
('85', 189, 6, 21, 317606) If you can keep the ashes in a little box which can be put in a pocket you may do so.
('85', 189, 6, 22, 317692) You do not have to do this because I am saying so, but only if you yourself fully understand its meaning and its importance.
('85', 189, 6, 23, 317817) Only then can it profit you.

('85', 206, 7, 10, 338337) Bapu was very glad to have your letter of 3rd inst.
('85', 206, 7, 11, 338389) He is sorry he cannot write to you himself as he has been forced to further curtail his work owing to overstrain.
('85', 206, 7, 12, 338503) In fact he has almost reached the limit of his capacity and has had natures warning signals which he cannot ignore.
('85', 206, 8, 13, 338619) He does not want to undertake a fast, but he is faced with a moral dilemma and he is praying to God for light.
('85', 206, 8, 14, 338730) He will not undertake the fast unless he has the clearest indication that it is the will of God.
('85', 206, 9, 15, 338827) I hope you had a favourable response from the trustees of the Kasturba Memorial Fund with regard to your proposal about your school.

('85', 207, 1, 2, 339442) 330. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS 1
('85', 207, 2, 3, 339472) SEVAGRAM, November 27, 1944 At present, the Hindustani prachar work is being carried on in Gujarat by Shri Amritlal Nanavati.
('85', 207, 2, 4, 339598) This work is in accordance with the scheme prepared by Kakasaheb in consultation with me.
('85', 207, 2, 5, 339688) Hindi prachar work is being conducted by the Rashtrabhasha Prachar Samiti, Wardha, appointed by the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan.
('85', 207, 2, 6, 339812) Both these activities are supposed to be undertaken for spreading the national language.
('85', 207, 2, 7, 339901) I regard myself as the founder of the Hindustani Prachar Sabha.
('85', 207, 2, 8, 339965) In 1925, the resolution about Hindustani was passed at the Cawnpore session of the Indian National Congress.
('85', 207, 2, 9, 340074) But no attempt was made to act upon the resolution.
('85', 207, 2, 10, 340126) The Hindustani Prachar Sabha was, therefore, established in Wardha on the 2nd May, 1942. The Sabha has defined Hindustani as follows:
('85', 207, 3, 11, 340260) Hindustani is that language which the Hindus, Muslims and all other people of villages and towns in Northern India speak, understandand use for mutual intercourse, which is written and read in both the Nagari and the Persian scripts, and the literary forms of which are recognized today as Hindi and Urdu.
('85', 207, 4, 12, 340566) But before the work of the Sabha could be started properly, many people of the country, including the founders of the Sabha, were thrust into jails on account of the August Resolution 3 of the Congress.
('85', 207, 4, 13, 340769) Shri Nanavati was not in jail, and he felt that he should start the Hindustani prachar work.
('85', 207, 4, 14, 340862) In my opinion he has served the country by doing this work.
('85', 207, 4, 15, 340922) Hindi and Urdu are the two literary styles of the same national language.
('85', 207, 4, 16, 340996) These two styles are, at present, diverging from each other.
('85', 207, 4, 17, 341057) From the point of view of RashtrabhashaHindustaniit is necessary to bring these two styles nearer to each other.
('85', 207, 4, 18, 341170) Without the knowledge of both these styles and the scripts this is impossible to achieve.
('85', 207, 5, 19, 341260) 1 This was issued on January 10, 1945, by Shriman Narayan, Honorary General Secretary, All India Hindustani Prachar Sabha, in order to remove misunderstandings about the object and work of the Sabha.
('85', 207, 5, 20, 341460) The Gujarati original appeared in Gujarat Samachar, 2 12 1944. 2 Gujarat Samachar has this paragraph in Hindi.

('85', 208, 0, 1, 341648) VOL.85 : 2 OCTOBER, 1944 3 MARCH, 1945 209
('85', 208, 1, 2, 341691) The venom of Hindu Muslim differences has entered the sphere of language as well.
('85', 208, 1, 3, 341773) I have been possessed with the idea of Hindu Muslim unity ever since my childhood.
('85', 208, 1, 4, 341856) In order to eliminate this poison of disunity in the domain of language, it is necessary to learn both the styles and the scripts.
('85', 208, 1, 5, 341987) If the Congress desires to conduct its work without Englishand this must be doneit is the duty of each Congressman to learn both the styles and the scripts.
('85', 208, 1, 6, 342144) This will result in the happy fusion of Hindi and Urdu, and the language that will thus evolve will be the natural Hindustani.
('85', 208, 1, 7, 342271) A question is asked whether the enthusiasm for learning both the styles and the scripts should be among both the Hindus and Muslims or only in one of them.
('85', 208, 1, 8, 342427) A misunderstanding lurks behind this question.
('85', 208, 1, 9, 342474) Those who make progress in the knowledge of languages will stand to gain: those who do not will be the losers.
('85', 208, 1, 10, 342585) Moreover, he who cherishes unity will take special pains to know both the styles and the scripts.
('85', 208, 1, 11, 342683) It should also be remembered that, in provinces like the Punjab, the Hindus, Muslims and all others know only Urdu.
('85', 208, 1, 12, 342799) To know at least this much is the duty of every patriot.
('85', 208, 1, 13, 342856) In a vast country like India, the more languages we strive to learn the better equipped shall we become for national service.
('85', 208, 1, 14, 342982) Should both the scripts and the styles be learnt by national workers and Congressmen only or by all?
('85', 208, 1, 15, 343083) My answer to this question is that all Indians should become Congressmen, and thus everybody should learn both the styles and the scripts.
('85', 208, 1, 16, 343222) In fact, the very question is irrelevant, because only a very limited number of men and women have so far developed this hobby of learning the national language.
('85', 208, 1, 17, 343384) We cannot go into raptures over the fact that a few thousands or a few lakhs of people appear at the Rashtrabhasha examinations.
('85', 208, 1, 18, 343513) Even the number of persons in the non Hindi and non Urdu areas who desire to learn only Hindi or Urdu is not sufficient to satisfy our ambition.
('85', 208, 1, 19, 343658) Is it not enough that those who desire to learn Urdu should do so through the Anjuman 1 and those who desire to learn Hindi should do so through the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan?
('85', 208, 1, 20, 343831) Not at all.
('85', 208, 1, 21, 343843) It was precisely because of this that the Congress passed the resolution on Hindustani and the need of establishing the Hindustani Prachar Sabha was felt.
('85', 208, 1, 22, 343998) The scopes of both the institutions (Sammelan and Anjuman) are restricted, and from my point of view, narrow as well.
('85', 208, 1, 23, 344116) It is my cherished desire that both these sister institutions should co operate with each other.
('85', 208, 1, 24, 344213) When that auspicious

('85', 209, 1, 2, 344301) day will really dawn, the work of the Hindustani Prachar Sabha will be deemed to be over.
('85', 209, 1, 3, 344391) So long as this situation does not arise, the Hindustani Prachar Sabha should continue to perform its duty.
('85', 209, 1, 4, 344499) I do hope that these two sister associations will not only tolerate but also welcome this third sister institution which seeks to establish unity between them.
('85', 209, 1, 5, 344659) In Gujarat many workers who are at present engaged in Hindi and Hindustani prachar work are my colleagues.
('85', 209, 1, 6, 344766) Some of them have sought my guidance.
('85', 209, 1, 7, 344804) This statement is my guidance to them.
('85', 209, 1, 8, 344843) If those who are working for the Wardha Samiti of the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan agree with my views on Hindustani prachar, they should take up this work as well.
('85', 209, 1, 9, 345002) They can certainly teach and coach for the Sammelan examinations those students who desire to learn only the Hindi style and the Devanagari script.
('85', 209, 1, 10, 345150) But they themselves should popularize both the styles and the scripts and should also try to persuade as many persons as they can to do the same.
('85', 209, 1, 11, 345296) So far as language is connected with the welfare of the nation, I regard Hindustani prachar work to be most essential.
('85', 209, 1, 12, 345415) There should never develop any conflict between the two activities (of Hindi and Hindustani).
('85', 209, 1, 13, 345509) Now a question arises as to what should be done by those who have so far learnt or may learn in future only Hindi or only Urdu.Such persons should learn the other style or script and sit for the Hindustani examinations which are to be conducted in both the scripts.
('85', 209, 1, 14, 345775) Those who have already learnt one style and script will find it very easy to answer the question papers.

('85', 214, 5, 10, 351388) Your worrying about my health is misplaced.
('85', 214, 5, 11, 351432) It is quite unnecessary to give any importance to the reeling ensations.
('85', 214, 5, 12, 351505) Nothing would have happened if I were not observing silence.
('85', 214, 5, 13, 351566) It am exhausted, no doubt.
('85', 214, 5, 14, 351593) I have therefore increased the amount of rest and I shall go on increasing it if I feel the need.

('85', 214, 5, 26, 352243) Sushila is trying to do something herself.
('85', 214, 5, 27, 352286) She is training a few girls, and she will carry on as she thinks right.
('85', 214, 5, 28, 352358) Thinking about a board of trustees I see that any scheme coming from outside will necessarily have to be examined.
('85', 214, 5, 29, 352473) So there will have to be a board.
('85', 214, 5, 30, 352507) I am considering its final form.
('85', 214, 5, 31, 352540) You too should think over it and write to me.
('85', 214, 5, 32, 352586) The onslaught of Ayurveda, homoeopathy, etc., is crushing.

('85', 218, 4, 12, 356622) One invariable rule is that it is to be offered by one who suffers tyranny.
('85', 218, 4, 13, 356698) The country should be able to stand by him.
('85', 218, 4, 14, 356742) I or anybody else who might lead the band of satyagrahis must drift with the current.
('85', 218, 4, 15, 356828) As things stand now it seems to be impossible.

('85', 218, 8, 21, 357102) Why should you be afraid in the night?

('85', 218, 8, 23, 357170) He keeps watch for us even while we are asleep, why should we be afraid then?
('85', 218, 8, 24, 357248) Sleep after reciting Ramanama and have no fear at all.

('85', 219, 2, 3, 357522) SEVAGRAM, November 28, 1944 You are going not only to have your ears treated but for nature cure in a wider sense.
('85', 219, 2, 4, 357637) My opinion is that your deafness is closely connected with the state of your mind.
('85', 219, 2, 5, 357720) Nature cure includes mental activity.
('85', 219, 2, 6, 357758) In this sense uttering Ramanama, reading the Gita, and so on, are part of nature cure.
('85', 219, 2, 7, 357845) Perhaps Rajujis 1 centre will provide this.
('85', 219, 2, 8, 357889) I have a feeling that Raju looks at nature cure in a spiritual way.
('85', 219, 2, 9, 357957) You too should make such an effort.
('85', 219, 2, 10, 357993) Give up all other thoughts.
('85', 219, 2, 11, 358021) Go there determined that you will be cured and you will get back your hearing.
('85', 219, 2, 12, 358100) Take the treatment that Raju advises and eat what he says you should.
('85', 219, 2, 13, 358170) Do some reading and writing.
('85', 219, 2, 14, 358199) Leave all thoughts of Vidya, Father, Mother, myself and Mahadev (son).
('85', 219, 2, 15, 358270) You will be doing good to them all by giving up their thought.
('85', 219, 2, 16, 358333) Detachment will help cure your ears.
('85', 219, 2, 17, 358370) Do not think about the ears.
('85', 219, 2, 18, 358399) Think about work.
('85', 219, 2, 19, 358417) Try and remove the shortcomings you notice in Rajus centre.
('85', 219, 2, 20, 358477) Get to know the patients there.
('85', 219, 2, 21, 358509) Speak to Gokhale or Babaji.
('85', 219, 2, 22, 358537) Learn the Gita from them.
('85', 219, 2, 23, 358563) Learn Telugu.
('85', 219, 2, 24, 358577) We from the North neglect the four Southern languages.
('85', 219, 2, 25, 358632) It is a great mistake.
('85', 219, 2, 26, 358655) In short you are going to Andhra for a new life.
('85', 219, 2, 27, 358704) You must give there what you have taken from here and you have to bring here what you find there.
('85', 219, 2, 28, 358802) Do spinning and other allied work regularly.
('85', 219, 2, 29, 358847) What more?
('85', 219, 2, 30, 358858) God is with you.
('85', 219, 3, 31, 358875) Blessings from BAPU [PS] It will be good if you show this to Gokhale and Babaji.
('85', 219, 3, 32, 358956) But do as you please.

('85', 220, 1, 2, 359126) 351. INTERVIEW TO N. G. RANGA
('85', 220, 2, 3, 359156) November 28, 1944
('85', 220, 3, 4, 359174) At the second interview 1 Prof.
('85', 220, 3, 5, 359206) Ranga placed before Gandhiji two alternative proposals for the re organization of the Kisan Sabhas and their co ordination with the Congress organization.
('85', 220, 3, 6, 359361) They were:
('85', 220, 4, 7, 359372) (1) To include in the kisan councils that may be formed one third representation from corresponding Congress Committees.
('85', 220, 4, 8, 359493) This would secure for them the co operation and the advice of the Congress.
('85', 220, 5, 9, 359569) (2) (a) To adopt Congress membership as a basic membership for the kisan organization.
('85', 220, 6, 10, 359656) (b) To constitute kisan councils out of rural delegates to the Congress Committees elected as per the present constitution.
('85', 220, 6, 11, 359780) Such kisan councils would be part of the Congress Committees while retaining their separate Corporate existence for dealing with the problems relating to the kisans.
('85', 220, 7, 12, 359946) (c) In addition to Congress members some non Congress but not anti Congress members also might be taken on the kisan councils to provide a suitable representation.
('85', 220, 8, 13, 360110) He felt that the first formula would be more acceptable than the second to most Kisan Sabhaites.
('85', 220, 8, 14, 360207) The final clause in the second formula too had the same object in view, namely, to make it acceptable to them.
('85', 220, 8, 15, 360318) GANDHIJI: But this is a variation upon what you suggested last time.
('85', 220, 8, 16, 360387) Then you suggested that the Kisan Sabha will have no member who is not a member of the Congress also.
('85', 220, 9, 17, 360489) RANGA : We want to have in our organization some non Congress kisans also who are not anti Congress but for various reasons could not afford to join the Congress.
('85', 220, 9, 18, 360652) GANDHIJI: Why do you want that?
('85', 220, 9, 19, 360684) You said that you did not want anything in opposition to the Congress.
('85', 220, 9, 20, 360755) So, if you have for your members only Congressmen, the kisan organization will deal with matters relating to the rights of kisans as against landlords and employers.
('85', 220, 9, 21, 360921) It wont deal with political questions.
('85', 220, 9, 22, 360960) I thought that I could reconcile myself to it.
('85', 220, 9, 23, 361007) I said I approached it with hesitation while it was for you to dispel my doubts.
('85', 220, 9, 24, 361088) So you better stick to your original proposal.
('85', 220, 10, 25, 361135) RANGA : It has been forcibly brought home to us that the Congress people feel nervous about this double membership.
('85', 220, 10, 26, 361251) So I thought the Kisan Sabha had better remain as a distinct body.
('85', 220, 10, 27, 361318) Our workers are used to that idea.
('85', 220, 10, 28, 361353) I have been able to
('85', 220, 11, 29, 361373) 1 For the earlier interview, vide Interview to N.G. Ranga, 29 10 1944.
('85', 221, 0, 1, 361444) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 222
('85', 221, 1, 2, 361486) persuade them that so far as politics is concerned we must accept Congress leadership.
('85', 221, 1, 3, 361573) The idea is that after the Congress elections are over the rural delegates will form themselves into a kisan council.
('85', 221, 1, 4, 361691) This kisan council will deal with matters relating to the kisans and in politics accept the lead of the Congress.
('85', 221, 1, 5, 361805) GANDHIJI: My suggestion is this.
('85', 221, 1, 6, 361838) You have your own organization where you register all the kisans.
('85', 221, 1, 7, 361904) As soon as the kisan becomes your member, he becomes also a Congress member.
('85', 221, 1, 8, 361981) Matters particularly bearing on the kisans and their relationship with the landlords, etc., are then tackled by your organization while political matters will be tackled by the Congress.
('85', 221, 2, 9, 362168) RANGA: In that case may we retain one anna for the kisan council out of the Congress membership fee of four annas?
('85', 221, 2, 10, 362283) GANDHIJI: You can do that subject to Congress approval.
('85', 221, 2, 11, 362339) This would mean that the Congress allows a gratuity of one anna to you for doing this special work.
('85', 221, 2, 12, 362439) If I were at the head of Congress affairs I would certainly allow it.
('85', 221, 3, 13, 362509) RANGA : In the mean time may we start with one anna membership from now on the clear understanding that those who are now enrolled are to become members of the Congress as soon as the Congress organization again begins to function?
('85', 221, 3, 14, 362741) Or we can take five annas from each member now and out of it keep four annas in trust for the Congress.
('85', 221, 3, 15, 362845) GANDHIJI: I am afraid you cannot do it today.
('85', 221, 3, 16, 362891) You must do it openly or not at all.
('85', 221, 3, 17, 362928) Do not collect the four annas Congress membership fee in advance.
('85', 221, 3, 18, 362994) I will suggest a better plan which I recommended to Shrimati Rama Devi.
('85', 221, 3, 19, 363066) Have a register of workers only.
('85', 221, 3, 20, 363099) Dont have Congress members just now.
('85', 221, 4, 21, 363136) RANGA: Cant we have something like a Congress Seva Sangh, an ad hoc body of Congress workers but not Congress members, to carry out Congress work?
('85', 221, 4, 22, 363283) GANDHIJI: Yes, you may do that.
('85', 221, 4, 23, 363315) But seeing that ours is a non violent body their work will only be to carry on the fifteen fold constructive programme.
('85', 221, 4, 24, 363435) That will avoid tussle with the Communists also.
('85', 221, 4, 25, 363484) Today you are not working for power but as Congress servants.
('85', 221, 4, 26, 363546) If you carry on your work silently and unostentatiously you become irresistible.
('85', 221, 4, 27, 363627) No one will come in unless he wants to work with you.
('85', 221, 4, 28, 363681) There will be no eloquence or Press publicity to attract power seekers.
('85', 221, 5, 29, 363753) RANGA: Eloquence by itself, I admit, is no good but has it not its use when coupled with solid public work?
('85', 221, 5, 30, 363861) GANDHIJI: Work by itself is eloquence.
('85', 221, 5, 31, 363900) Here there are workers in Khadi Vidyalaya, Hindustani Talimi Sangh and the Gram Seva Sangh, working themselves to death.
('85', 221, 5, 32, 364021) They make no speeches.
('85', 221, 5, 33, 364044) They speak to the villagers through their activity.

('85', 222, 1, 2, 364139) RANGA: As regards the Communists they have done a lot of harm so far as kisan work is concerned and as a result have become very unpopular.
('85', 222, 1, 3, 364279) There are two kisan organizations in Andhra, one Congress minded, the other Communist.
('85', 222, 1, 4, 364366) So far as we are concerned we keep the Communists out of our organization.
('85', 222, 1, 5, 364441) GANDHIJI: You wont be able to keep anybody out of primary membership by merely making rules.
('85', 222, 1, 6, 364534) But you can keep out trouble if you work on the lines I have indicated.

('85', 225, 3, 6, 369029) How can I tolerate this?
('85', 225, 3, 7, 369054) It means that a part of India can be independent, and the British rule will continue in the States ruled by the Princes and in the Muslim majority Provinces.
('85', 225, 3, 8, 369212) I can never be a willing witness to this.
('85', 225, 3, 9, 369254) I cannot understand how you can be.
('85', 225, 3, 10, 369290) You may, if you wish, meet Rajaji and seek clarification.
('85', 225, 3, 11, 369348) I have stated here the position as I have understood it.
('85', 225, 3, 12, 369405) See that in trying to secure something you do not lose everything.
('85', 225, 3, 13, 369472) Go thoroughly into the details.

('85', 229, 3, 8, 374427) It is my firm conviction that even from a purely modern point of view fasting has an important place.
('85', 229, 3, 9, 374529) It is as much necessary for the atman that takes on a body as for the body itself.

('85', 232, 3, 4, 378583) I am sorry to say that I am physically not so fit and fresh as I had expected to be and that I have decided to take complete rest for four weeks commencing from the 4th December in order that I may be able threafter to take up the work more energetically.
('85', 232, 3, 5, 378839) However, I warn the members not to take pity on me and spare me in the deliberations.
('85', 232, 3, 6, 378925) Shri Jajuji, the General Secretary of the Sangh, has discussed with me 2 the future policy of the Sangh in all its aspects for seven days devoting one hour daily to it The gist of those discussions has been sent to the members of the Board and other prominent khadi workers in the form of a circular letter.
('85', 232, 3, 7, 379233) Replies thereto have been received from a number of members and they are all before the Board for their consideration.
('85', 232, 3, 8, 379352) The chief thing that I want the members to consider is that so far the Sangh work was directed from the Central Office, but henceforth the work is to be decentralized and any province or district which wants to be autonomous is to be allowed to do so.
('85', 232, 3, 9, 379604) Workers must be prepared to go to organize such autonomous centres with the prestige and moral support of the Sangh.
('85', 232, 3, 10, 379721) The worker will be paid a maintenance for five years on an annually diminishing scale.
('85', 232, 3, 11, 379808) He should work there according to the fundamental principles and policy laid down by the Sangh.
('85', 232, 3, 12, 379904) It is not possible otherwise to decentralize the work in seven lakhs of villages.
('85', 232, 3, 13, 379986) There are two schools of thought current in the world.
('85', 232, 3, 14, 380041) One wants to divide the world into cities and the other into villages.
('85', 232, 3, 15, 380112) The village civilization and the city civilization are totally different things.
('85', 232, 3, 16, 380193) One depends on machinery and industrialization, the other rests on handicraft.
('85', 232, 3, 17, 380272) We have given preference to the latter.
('85', 232, 3, 18, 380312) After all, this industrialization and large scale production are only of comparatively recent growth.
('85', 232, 3, 19, 380414) We do not know how far it has contributed to our development and happiness, but we know this much that it has brought in its wake the recent world wars.
('85', 232, 3, 20, 380567) This second world war is not still over and even before it comes to an end we are hearing of a third world war.
('85', 232, 4, 21, 380679) 1 From Charkha Sanghka Navasamskaran 2 Between October 7 and 14
('85', 233, 0, 1, 380743) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 234
('85', 233, 1, 2, 380785) Our country was never so unhappy and miserable as it is at present.
('85', 233, 1, 3, 380853) In the cities people may be getting big profits and good wages, but all that has become possible by sucking the blood of villagers.
('85', 233, 1, 4, 380985) We do not want to collect lakhs and crores.
('85', 233, 1, 5, 381029) We do not always want to depend on money for our work.
('85', 233, 1, 6, 381084) If we are prepared to sacrifice our lives for the cause, money is nothing.
('85', 233, 1, 7, 381159) We must have faith and we must be true to ourselves.
('85', 233, 1, 8, 381212) If we have these, we shall be able to decentralize our capital of thirty lakhs in the villages to create national wealth amounting to three hundred crores.
('85', 233, 1, 9, 381368) To do that, the main thing that is necessary is to make the village self sufficient and self reliant.
('85', 233, 1, 10, 381470) But mind you, my idea of self sufficiency is not a narrow one.
('85', 233, 1, 11, 381533) There is no scope for selfishness or arrogance in my self sufficiency.
('85', 233, 1, 12, 381604) I am not preaching isolation.
('85', 233, 1, 13, 381634) We have to be humble as dust for a cause.
('85', 233, 1, 14, 381676) We have to mix with people even as sugar mixes itself with milk.
('85', 233, 1, 15, 381741) Though the villagers will be self sufficient so far as it is possible, they will devote their time also to their intellectual development for the creation of the consciousness for the contemplated non violent society of the future.
('85', 233, 1, 16, 381973) Cloth stands second to food as necessity.
('85', 233, 1, 17, 382015) If every village begins to produce its own cloth, its strength will greatly be enhanced.
('85', 233, 1, 18, 382104) But to achieve that we do not want to close down the textile factories by legislation.
('85', 233, 1, 19, 382191) We want to achieve our purpose by revolutionizing the psychology of the people.
('85', 233, 1, 20, 382271) By decentralization we want to produce cloth wherever cotton is grown.
('85', 233, 1, 21, 382342) But what of the city people who have taken to khadi now?
('85', 233, 1, 22, 382399) I would ask them to spin their own yarn and to find out for themselves weavers to weave that yarn into cloth.
('85', 233, 1, 23, 382509) It is absurd that the cloth should come from Manchester for the poor, who produce cloth for Bombay people.
('85', 233, 1, 24, 382616) It is also not proper to compel the poor to accept part of their wages in the form of khadi.
('85', 233, 1, 25, 382709) They should be so educated that they may Spin voluntarily and intelligently and may use with love and pride the cloth produced by them.
('85', 233, 1, 26, 382845) If the people of Bombay want to wear khadi they should spin for themselves or get their children and other dependents to spin.
('85', 233, 1, 27, 382972) If people pledged to khadi, spin for themselves, the practice will be contagious.
('85', 233, 1, 28, 383054) Even if we are able to produce khadi worth ten crores instead of one crore as at present our object of reaching the whole of India will not be achieved.

('85', 234, 1, 2, 383250) Gandhiji then read out the resolution 1 which he wanted the Board to consider and adopt.
('85', 234, 1, 3, 383339) Whilst explaining its implications he said: The workers of all our five constructive programme institutions (Charkha Sangh, Gram Udyog Sangh, Hindustani Talimi Sangh, Harijan Sevak Sangh, Goseva Sangh) should possess such knowledge that the politics of the whole country may be guided by them.
('85', 234, 1, 4, 383633) Today we are all the while thinking that our work will be able to make headway only when Rajaji becomes the Prime Minister of Madras.
('85', 234, 1, 5, 383767) But that is not proper.
('85', 234, 1, 6, 383791) In our present politics we are looking with longing eyes to the Viceroys Secretariat but if we do our work properly the Viceroy will have to come to us.
('85', 234, 1, 7, 383944) He will see our work and realize that it is not possible to keep such people in subjection or to rule over them.
('85', 234, 1, 8, 384057) When seven lakhs of villages will take up this work in the new spirit we shall not remain a subject nation.
('85', 234, 1, 9, 384165) Each one of our villages will be independent and self reliant.
('85', 234, 1, 10, 384228) That is true swaraj and that is true democracy.
('85', 234, 1, 11, 384276) I do not worry when we shall be able to attain our goal, but if we are sure of our path and if we have faith that it is the only true one, we should go on striving for it incessantly and uninterruptedly.

('85', 234, 3, 14, 384540) SEVAGRAM, December 1, 1944 That man proposes and God disposes constantly proves true in my case, as I expect it does in every case whether we realize it or not.
('85', 234, 3, 15, 384701) I was contemplating a food fast for reasons I hold to be entirely spiritual.
('85', 234, 3, 16, 384778) But for the time being, it is being replaced by a day to day work fast.
('85', 234, 3, 17, 384850) I had hoped that I had recovered sufficiently to be able to go through the routine work without interruption.
('85', 234, 3, 18, 384960) But natures warning has been sounding in my ears during the last ten days.
('85', 234, 3, 19, 385035) I was feeling fatigued.
('85', 234, 3, 20, 385059) Even after the noonday siesta, the brain seemed tired.
('85', 234, 3, 21, 385114) There was a complete disinclination to speak or write.
('85', 234, 3, 22, 385169) But I continued hoping that I would be all right without having to discontinue mental activity.
('85', 234, 3, 23, 385265) But nature would have her way.
('85', 234, 3, 24, 385296) Rajaji who saw me after a month detected a marked change in my face, and he said, You must stop all
('85', 234, 4, 25, 385396) 1 For the draft resolution, vide Speech at A.I.S.A. Meeting II, 2 9 1944 and for the resolution passed, vide Appendix Resolution Passed by A.I.S.A., on or before 3 12 1944.
('85', 235, 0, 1, 385569) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 236
('85', 235, 1, 2, 385611) this ceaseless mental activity if you want to avoid a disaster. I seized the suggestion.
('85', 235, 1, 3, 385700) He even went so far as to say that I should not mind disappointing invited workers of the Charkha Sangh, although I was looking forward eagerly to meeting them and discussing with them my plan for a new orientation of khadi work.
('85', 235, 1, 4, 385930) But I would not listen.
('85', 235, 1, 5, 385954) So I am going through these meetings in the best manner I can in the hope that no crisis will overtake me during the remaining two days of these meetings.
('85', 235, 1, 6, 386109) From the 4th to the 31st of this month, I have decided rigidly to discontinue all public activities, all interviews for public or private purposes and all correspondence of any nature whatsoever.
('85', 235, 1, 7, 386305) I shall read no newspapers during the period.
('85', 235, 1, 8, 386351) This abstention will be subject to exception for unforeseen circumstances of a grave nature.
('85', 235, 1, 9, 386444) I shall not deny myself the pleasure of reading non political literature in which I am interested.
('85', 235, 1, 10, 386543) This also I shall read without in any way unduly taxing the brain.
('85', 235, 1, 11, 386610) I have asked friends who were expecting to see me during the month to indulgently postpone their visits for the time being.
('85', 235, 1, 12, 386734) Let readers not be alarmed at what is only a precautionary measure.
('85', 235, 1, 13, 386802) Dr. Sushila Nayyar assures me that there is nothing physically wrong with me except that my old friends, the hookworms and the amoebae, have not left me.
('85', 235, 1, 14, 386956) I am able to take daily walks without the slightest strain and they will be continued.
('85', 235, 1, 15, 387043) I had hoped to make one or two public statements in connection with a lot of misrepresentations of my views and doings about the communal question and some other public questions.
('85', 235, 1, 16, 387223) I must forbear for the time being.
('85', 235, 1, 17, 387258) But I must repeat the warning I have given before, that nothing that is not authoritatively stated by me should be accepted by the public.
('85', 235, 1, 18, 387397) There are things which I have seen in the Press which I can only say I am incapable of having countenanced directly or indirectly.
('85', 235, 1, 19, 387528) There are some vital questions addressed to me by correspondents.
('85', 235, 1, 20, 387594) They will forgive me for my inability to deal with them for the moment.
('85', 235, 1, 21, 387666) If, after a month, they still feel the necessity, they will please repeat their letters and if all goes well, I shall gladly reply.
('85', 235, 1, 22, 387798) Starvation of millions, black markets, and what I cannot but describe as gambling, will continue to worry me as they do now.
('85', 235, 1, 23, 387923) I can but entreat my numerous co workers to do what they can to ease the situation, which can be done, I am perfectly sure, if those concerned will make up their minds that the claims of the famishing millions are the first charge on their care and attention.

('85', 237, 3, 4, 389501) AKBAR, I have made arrangements for a watch for you.
('85', 237, 3, 5, 389554) You will get it soon.
('85', 237, 3, 6, 389576) I have read all your letters.
('85', 237, 3, 7, 389606) You have been doing fine work.
('85', 237, 3, 8, 389637) God will bless you with success.
('85', 237, 3, 9, 389670) You will soon get lots of drugs, but they will not be very helpful.
('85', 237, 3, 10, 389738) So long as water, fire and earth are available, drugs are not necessary.
('85', 237, 3, 11, 389811) Give the people boiled water to drink.
('85', 237, 3, 12, 389850) This will cure most of the complaints.
('85', 237, 3, 13, 389889) Use soda [bicarb] if you have it.
('85', 237, 3, 14, 389923) Water containing soda will stop diarrhoea.
('85', 237, 3, 15, 389966) Food should be stopped.
('85', 237, 3, 16, 389990) Persuade the people patiently to stop eating.
('85', 237, 3, 17, 390036) You may even let them die who do not listen to you.
('85', 237, 3, 18, 390088) Search for village medicinal herbs.
('85', 237, 3, 19, 390124) You must have neem trees there.
('85', 237, 3, 20, 390156) If you persuade the people to chew its leaves and see that they fast, the fever will probably disappear.
('85', 237, 3, 21, 390261) Boil neem leaves in water and wash the blisters with that.
('85', 237, 3, 22, 390320) The water should be bearably hot.
('85', 237, 3, 23, 390354) Cover the blisters with a mud pack of clean earth.
('85', 237, 3, 24, 390405) Get clean cloth for bandaging the blisters.
('85', 237, 3, 25, 390449) If you can get tamarind you can give a solution of it in place of water mixed with lemon juice.
('85', 237, 3, 26, 390545) Revive peoples knowledge of nature cure remedies.
('85', 237, 3, 27, 390595) Local medicinal drugs should be made available.
('85', 237, 3, 28, 390643) Give rice water instead of milk.
('85', 237, 3, 29, 390676) If you mix jaggery with it, it will provide more energy.
('85', 237, 3, 30, 390733) Teach people the rules of hygiene.
('85', 237, 3, 31, 390768) If food is stopped to people suffering from fever or diarrhoea and they are put on boiled water, more than fifty per cent of the cases will recover.
('85', 237, 3, 32, 390917) I have no doubt in my mind about this at all.
('85', 237, 3, 33, 390963) Fifty per cent is a conservative guess.
('85', 237, 3, 34, 391003) For guinea worm, try fomentation with hot water and tie up the thing as it comes out.
('85', 237, 3, 35, 391089) Try also a poultice of onions.
('85', 237, 3, 36, 391120) You must have received the suggestions sent by Kishorelalbhai and Sushilabehn.
('85', 237, 3, 37, 391199) I have suggested only the simplest remedies.
('85', 237, 3, 38, 391244) Let Devibehn send whatever she wishes.
('85', 237, 3, 39, 391283) If cows, buffaloes or goats are offered, accept them.
('85', 237, 3, 40, 391337) To meateaters you may unhesitatingly give meat soup.
('85', 237, 3, 41, 391390) Soup means water in which meat has been boiled.
('85', 237, 3, 42, 391438) These things should be served hot after boiling them.
('85', 237, 3, 43, 391492) This is not the time for doing our religious duty of propagating vegetarianism.
('85', 237, 3, 44, 391572) Soup is bound to be useful where milk is not available.

('85', 238, 7, 9, 392009) December 2, 1944
('85', 238, 8, 10, 392026) BHAI KHWAJA, I had known it even earlier that my Muslim friends who are not with the League were a little angry with me because I went to Bombay to talk with Jinnah Saheb and did not talk with them.
('85', 238, 8, 11, 392225) As I have already written to you earlier, I can never be unfaithful to the Muslims or Islam.
('85', 238, 8, 12, 392318) I had never thought that I would have any settlement with Jinnah Saheb which would be against the interests of my Muslim friends who have joined me in making sacrifices or which would harm the genuine interests of any community in India.
('85', 238, 8, 13, 392556) Had any such situation arisen, I would have certainly consulted some of you.
('85', 238, 8, 14, 392633) I was distressed to learn that some of my Muslim friends think that in my friendliness with Jinnah Saheb I have ignored them.
('85', 238, 8, 15, 392759) That certainly is not the case.
('85', 238, 8, 16, 392791) It must be accepted that the majority of the Muslim community belongs to the Muslim League whose Quaid e Azam is Jinnah Saheb.
('85', 238, 8, 17, 392918) It must also be accepted that he is opposed to our line of action.
('85', 238, 8, 18, 392985) That is why I wished that either he should convert me to his course or I should convert him to mine, and if this could be done, the Hindus and Muslims would march together to freedom.
('85', 238, 8, 19, 393169) I failed in my attempt.
('85', 238, 8, 20, 393193) I wish that Maulana Sabeb and certain other friends, particularly Maulvi Hafizur Rehman Saheb, Mufti Kifayatullah Saheb and Maulana Syed Ahmed Saheb would take the trouble of meeting me here.
('85', 238, 8, 21, 393385) I would try to clear their doubts.
('85', 238, 8, 22, 393420) We can all work together and pray to God to show us the straight path to freedom.
('85', 238, 8, 23, 393502) If all of you cannot come, it would be enough if only

('85', 239, 5, 9, 393953) DEAR FRIEND 1, This is with reference to your letter of 2nd November last.
('85', 239, 5, 10, 394028) My letter 2 of 17th July to Mr. Churchill was, in my estimation, of a sacred character, not meant for the public eye.
('85', 239, 5, 11, 394146) I now contemplate an occasion or time when it might need publication without losing the sacred character.
('85', 239, 5, 12, 394252) Even so I do not wish to publish it without the Prime Ministers permission.
('85', 239, 5, 13, 394328) May I have it, in case I need to publish it?
('85', 239, 6, 14, 394373) I should tell you that I have shown the contents to a few friends.

('85', 241, 1, 2, 396419) requires complete overhauling.
('85', 241, 1, 3, 396450) There are now no settlers.
('85', 241, 1, 4, 396477) Therefore the clause about them should go.
('85', 241, 1, 5, 396520) There is no formal resignation or withdrawal by them.
('85', 241, 1, 6, 396574) If the law requires it, a formal resignation should be secured from each one of them.
('85', 241, 1, 7, 396660) Perhaps their physical withdrawal amounts to resignation.
('85', 241, 1, 8, 396718) The following new trustees may be added: Manilal, Jalbhai 1, Medh 2
('85', 241, 2, 9, 396786) Manilal should be the managing trustee and the manager of the Settlement, including Indian Opinion.
('85', 241, 2, 10, 396886) He should draw from the Trust 100 per month for the maintenance of his family and children and live on the land free of rent with the right to use for his household the fruits, vegetables and cereals grown on the Settlement.
('85', 241, 2, 11, 397111) He should maintain proper books of account in connection with the Settlement and Indian Opinion.
('85', 241, 2, 12, 397208) He should be free, subject to its being no additional burden on the Settlement, to remove Indian Opinion partly or wholly to Durban.
('85', 241, 2, 13, 397341) Such changes as may be necessary may be made in the Trust Deed.
('85', 241, 2, 14, 397405) In the event of my death before the Deed is prepared and signed by me, this letter may be treated by the present trustees as authority for the changes herein suggested.

('85', 241, 6, 22, 397824) And where is the cause for worry when a thing is from God?
('85', 241, 6, 23, 397883) I had a discussion with Manilal and Jalbhai when he was here.
('85', 241, 6, 24, 397945) This is the result.
('85', 241, 6, 25, 397965) Three new trustees should be added.

('85', 241, 6, 27, 398028) Manilal should be the manager of the settlement in my place.

('85', 242, 1, 4, 398609) There should be a clause added giving the trustees authority to sell the proceeds to be utilized for the objects of the trust.
('85', 242, 1, 5, 398736) If a Kasturba memorial is to be founded, on the Phoenix ground, it should be properly secured.
('85', 242, 1, 6, 398831) If you, the remaining trustees, approve of my suggestions, an amended deed may be prepared and sent to me for my signature.
('85', 242, 1, 7, 398955) Should I die before my signature is taken, this letter should be used by the trustees as my wish in the matter.
('85', 242, 1, 8, 399067) I hope that they will give effect to it and free Manilal from the uncertainty that hangs over him.
('85', 242, 1, 9, 399166) I feel too that those settlers who are not working on the settlement, although they may be deemed to have resigned, should formally do so, to avoid future complications.

('85', 248, 7, 20, 406998) This should include their children.
('85', 248, 7, 21, 407034) You should also go and inspect their homes.

('85', 250, 3, 4, 408923) KRISHNACHANDRA, My idea was that the khadi work should be learnt as part of the Talimi Sangh training while working for the Talimi Sangh itself, in accordance with the sincere wishes of the couple 1. The work going on in the Khadi Vidyalaya these days is very good.
('85', 250, 3, 5, 409189) The work of the Talimi Sangh depends on khadi.
('85', 250, 3, 6, 409236) Whether or not it depends as much or more on agriculture remains to be seen.
('85', 250, 3, 7, 409313) What I mean to say is that I had very high expectations from you.
('85', 250, 3, 8, 409379) And I still believe that they will be fulfilled.
('85', 250, 3, 9, 409428) If there is anything else, you may join me tomorrow during my walk.
('85', 250, 3, 10, 409496) I shall be taking a walk towards Sevagram [village].

('85', 250, 7, 15, 409690) Hence if khadi, which is the main plank of the constructive programme, is to be saved, it ought to become self supporting.
('85', 250, 7, 16, 409813) Those who do not spin have no right to wear khadi.
('85', 250, 7, 17, 409864) All those who wear khadi must spin so that khadi may survive.

('85', 251, 5, 9, 410709) Obviously I expect you to become an ideal teacher in Nayee Talim.
('85', 251, 5, 10, 410775) That sums up everything.
('85', 251, 5, 11, 410800) Wherever you go it will be at my instance only.
('85', 251, 5, 12, 410848) But you must develop the ability to get along with Aryanayakum and Ashadevi.
('85', 251, 5, 13, 410925) I am in no hurry.
('85', 251, 5, 14, 410943) You will yourself understand that the experience of comradeship with them is in itself a part of your training in Nayee Talim.
('85', 251, 5, 15, 411070) After all you have started your own Nayee Talim, havent you?
('85', 251, 5, 16, 411131) Yes, I consider it very essential that you acquire complete mastery of carding.
('85', 251, 5, 17, 411211) Start [learning] it in the Khadi Vidyalaya after taking permission from both of them.

('85', 252, 11, 18, 412447) Today is Christmas Day.
('85', 252, 11, 19, 412471) We hold all religions in equal respect and all such festivals deserve respect.
('85', 252, 11, 20, 412550) But our respect is different from the common kind.
('85', 252, 11, 21, 412601) For us such festivals are for meditation and introspection.
('85', 252, 11, 22, 412661) On such occasions we should search our hearts and cleanse it of all impurity.
('85', 252, 11, 23, 412739) We should know that

('85', 253, 1, 3, 413075) We should not harm others for what we regard as Truth or right.
('85', 253, 1, 4, 413139) We should be prepared to die for Truth and when the call comes give our life for it and sanctify it with our blood.
('85', 253, 1, 5, 413255) This in my view is the essence of all religions.
('85', 253, 1, 6, 413304) On this day we should ponder upon this and remember that Jesus mounted the Cross for what he considered to be the Truth.

('85', 253, 5, 10, 413569) BHAI BENARSIDAS, It is natural to feel sad at Fathers passing away but if we reflect for a moment we shall realize that it is futile to grieve over the inevitable.
('85', 253, 5, 11, 413733) Why then should one grieve?
('85', 253, 5, 12, 413761) And who is it that dies?
('85', 253, 5, 13, 413786) Surely not the jiva 1 which was always associated with us, which is with us now and will remain with us hereafter.
('85', 253, 5, 14, 413901) Fathers last words are very precious to me.
('85', 253, 5, 15, 413945) I shall regard them as a blessing.

('85', 254, 1, 2, 414145) 411. A THOUGHT FOR THE DAY 1
('85', 254, 2, 3, 414174) November 20, 1944 Innumerable are the names of God; but if a choice were to be made of one, it would be Sat or Satya, that is, Truth.
('85', 254, 2, 4, 414308) Hence verily Truth is God.
('85', 254, 2, 5, 414335) November 21, 1944 Realization of Truth is not at all possible without ahimsa.
('85', 254, 2, 6, 414413) That is why it has been said that ahimsa is the supreme dharma.
('85', 254, 2, 7, 414477) November 22, 1944 The quest of truth and the observance of non violence are impossible without brahmacharya, non stealing, non possession, fearlessness, equal respect for all religions, removal of untouchability and the like.
('85', 254, 2, 8, 414703) November 23, 1944 Brahmacharya here mean control over the sense organsin thought, word and deed.
('85', 254, 2, 9, 414800) One who, while remaining bodily chaste, is impure at heart shall not be deemed a true brahmachari.
('85', 254, 2, 10, 414899) November 24, 1944 Non stealing does not mean mere abstention from theft.
('85', 254, 2, 11, 414972) To keep or take what one does not need is also stealing.
('85', 254, 2, 12, 415029) And of course stealing is fraught with violence.
('85', 254, 2, 13, 415078) November 25, 1944 Non possession means that we should not hoard anything that we do not need today.
('85', 254, 2, 14, 415178) November 26,1944 Fearlessness should connote absence of all kinds of fearfear of death, fear of bodily injury, fear of hunger, fear of insult, fear of public disapprobation, fear of ghosts and evil spirits, fear of anyones anger.
('85', 254, 2, 15, 415408) Freedom from all these and such other fears constitutes fearlessness.
('85', 254, 2, 16, 415478) November 27,1944 Let us respect other religions even as we respect our own.
('85', 254, 3, 17, 415554) 1 At the request of Anand T. Hingorani Gandhiji on November 20, 1944, started the practice of writing a thought for each day and continued it for about two years.
('85', 254, 3, 18, 415717) Those written during the period covered by this volume are given here as a single item under the last date, namely, December 31, 1944. The thoughts were originally written in Hindi.
('85', 255, 0, 1, 415899) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 256
('85', 255, 1, 2, 415941) tolerance thereof is not enough.
('85', 255, 1, 3, 415974) November 28, 1944 Removal of untouchability means not merely touching the Harijans, but also looking upon them as our own kith and kin; in other words, treating them in the same way as we would our own brothers and sisters.
('85', 255, 1, 4, 416198) None is high, none low.
('85', 255, 1, 5, 416222) November 29, 1944 Yogah ChittavrittinirodhahThis is the first aphorism of Patanjalis Yoga Darshan 1. Yoga is controlling the activities of the mind.
('85', 255, 1, 6, 416371) Restraining the surging passions, suppressing them, that is yoga.
('85', 255, 1, 7, 416437) November 30, 1944 How can one is whose mind passions keep surging ever realize truth?
('85', 255, 1, 8, 416523) The upsurge of passions in the mind is like a tempest in the ocean.
('85', 255, 1, 9, 416591) The helmsman who holds fast to the helm in a storm remains safe.
('85', 255, 1, 10, 416656) Likewise, he triumphs who relies upon Ramanama when the mind is restless.
('85', 255, 1, 11, 416730) December 1, 1944 The bhajan Take Thou a Lesson from the Tree 2 is worth laying to ones heart.
('85', 255, 1, 12, 416824) The tree bears the heat of the sun, yet provides cool shade to us.
('85', 255, 1, 13, 416891) What do we do?
('85', 255, 1, 14, 416906) December 2, 1944 Let us always beware of false knowledge.
('85', 255, 1, 15, 416964) That which keeps or turns us away from Truth is false knowledge.
('85', 255, 1, 16, 417029) December 3, 1944 For the realization of Truth it is necessary to read the lives of the saints and reflect upon them.
('85', 255, 1, 17, 417146) December 4, 1944 Against whom shall we harbour enmity when God Himself says that He dwells in all living beings?
('85', 255, 1, 18, 417259) (Translation of todays bhajan.) December 5, 1944 The great lesson that we learn from the life of Mirabai is that she renounced her alleven her husbandfor the sake of God.
('85', 255, 1, 19, 417430) December 6, 1944 What can a person not accomplish by faith?
('85', 255, 1, 20, 417490) He can do everything.
('85', 255, 1, 21, 417512) December 7, 1944 Man can overcome mountains by faith.

('85', 256, 1, 2, 417642) December 8, 1944 He who concentrates on any one thing with singleness of purpose, will ultimately acquire the capacity to do everything.
('85', 256, 1, 3, 417779) December 9, 1944 True happiness does not come from without; it comes from within.
('85', 256, 1, 4, 417861) December 10, 1944 He who loses his individuality loses all.
('85', 256, 1, 5, 417921) December 11, 1944 The straight path is as difficult as it is simple.
('85', 256, 1, 6, 417990) Were it not so, all would follow the straight path.
('85', 256, 1, 7, 418042) December 12, 1944 Compassion is the essence of religion, so Tulsidas has said.
('85', 256, 1, 8, 418121) And he adds: Abandon not compassion as long as you live. Suppliants for compassion ourselves, all of us, how shall we take compassion, and on whom?
('85', 256, 1, 9, 418269) December 13, 1944 A sister said: I used to pray, but have now given it up. I asked: Why? She replied: Because I used to deceive myself. The reply is of course correct.
('85', 256, 1, 10, 418437) But let her give up deceiving.
('85', 256, 1, 11, 418468) Why give up praying?
('85', 256, 1, 12, 418489) December 14, 1944 Yesterdays bhajan was very melodious and worth pondering over.
('85', 256, 1, 13, 418570) It says in essence: God dwells neither in the temple, nor in the mosque.
('85', 256, 1, 14, 418643) Neither within, nor without.
('85', 256, 1, 15, 418672) If at all He is anywhere, it is in the hunger and the thirst of the humble folk.
('85', 256, 1, 16, 418753) Let us spin daily in order to sate their hunger and quench their thirst, or, with Ramanama on our lips, engage ourselves in some such labour for their sake.
('85', 256, 1, 17, 418910) December 15, 1944 Why is it that even ordinarily we do not escape untruth be it out of fear or even shame?
('85', 256, 1, 18, 419017) Would it not be better to adopt silence instead, or, shedding fear of one another, speak frankly what is in our mind?
('85', 256, 1, 19, 419135) December 16, 1944 Even a little untruth ruins a man, as a drop of poison ruins milk.
('85', 256, 1, 20, 419220) December 17, 1944 We are loath to devote time to things that matter, but hanker after worthless things and find pleasure in them!!!
('85', 256, 1, 21, 419352) December 18, 1944 Man is not God; call him not that.
('85', 256, 1, 22, 419405) But of Divine refulgence he
('85', 257, 0, 1, 419433) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 258
('85', 257, 1, 2, 419475) is part. December 19, 1944 Listen to the discourses of the sages, study the scriptures, become learned.
('85', 257, 1, 3, 419579) But if you have not enthroned God in your heart, you have achieved nothing.
('85', 257, 1, 4, 419655) December 20, 1944 We all desire mukti 1 but, perhaps, we do not know precisely what it means.
('85', 257, 1, 5, 419749) Deliverance from the cycle of birth and death is one of its several meanings.
('85', 257, 1, 6, 419827) December 21, 1944 The poet saint Narsinh says: A man of God seeks not deliverance from birth and death; he asks to be born again and again. Viewed from this angle, mukti takes on a somewhat different form.
('85', 257, 1, 7, 420033) December 22, 1944 Extreme non attachment is salvation, according to the Gita, and we find the same meaning given in the first verse of the Ishopanishad.
('85', 257, 1, 8, 420186) December 23, 1944 How to develop non attachment?
('85', 257, 1, 9, 420235) This can be done by regarding joy and sorrow, friend and foe, mine and thine, as all alike.
('85', 257, 1, 10, 420327) Thus another name for non attachment is equanimity.
('85', 257, 1, 11, 420379) December 24, 1944 As drops add up to make the ocean, we can be friendly and become an ocean of friendliness.
('85', 257, 1, 12, 420488) The world would be transformed if everyone in the world lived in a spirit of mutual amity.
('85', 257, 1, 13, 420579) December 25, 1944 Today is Christmas Day.
('85', 257, 1, 14, 420621) For us who believe in the equality of all religions, the birth of Jesus Christ is as worthy of veneration as that of Rama, Krishna, etc.
('85', 257, 1, 15, 420758) December 26, 1944 Illness itself should be a matter of shame for man.
('85', 257, 1, 16, 420828) Illness betokens some lapse.
('85', 257, 1, 17, 420857) Illness should not beset one whose body and mind are wholly sound.
('85', 257, 1, 18, 420924) December 27, 1944 Evil thoughts are also a sign of illness.
('85', 257, 1, 19, 420984) Let us, therefore, avoid evil thoughts.
('85', 257, 1, 20, 421024) December 28, 1944 One infallible means for escaping evil thoughts is Ramanama.

('85', 258, 1, 2, 421158) The Name should come not merely from the lips but from the heart.
('85', 258, 1, 3, 421224) December 29, 1944 Numerous are our ailments; numerous, too, are physicians and their treatments.
('85', 258, 1, 4, 421321) But we would be spared much bother if we regarded all diseases as one and Rama as the one and only Physician who can eradicate them.
('85', 258, 1, 5, 421454) December 30, 1944 How strange that we run after physicians who are mortals themselves but forget Rama, the immortal, eternal and never failing Physician!
('85', 258, 1, 6, 421608) December 31, 1944 Stranger still it is that, knowing that we, too, are mortal and that a doctors treatment can at best but prolong our life for a few more days, we still run from pillar to post to seek it.

('85', 259, 7, 13, 423134) Do not at all worry on my account.
('85', 259, 7, 14, 423169) I am paying for my sins.
('85', 259, 7, 15, 423194) I had too much of Ayurveda and I suffered.
('85', 259, 7, 16, 423237) And now I am slowly throwing off the poison.
('85', 259, 7, 17, 423282) I have therefore grown very weak but I am watching the developments.
('85', 259, 7, 18, 423351) Hook worm and amoeba, my old enemies, wont leave me.
('85', 259, 7, 19, 423404) All this is but flushing out the poison that I had taken.
('85', 259, 7, 20, 423462) I do not know what other suffering is in store for me.
('85', 259, 7, 21, 423517) I shall go on doing as God dictates.

('85', 261, 6, 14, 425900) In that case he should draw as much as he needs for his maintenance and it should be borne by the goshala.
('85', 261, 6, 15, 426007) If he is not useful he will be a burden to the Goseva Sangh and will not learn anything.
('85', 261, 6, 16, 426096) If we do not adopt such a policy the G. S. S. will become just another mushroom institution which we should not allow to happen.

('85', 264, 6, 17, 430490) Your bangles should be in your heart.

('85', 271, 6, 15, 440202) I find that you do not meet any naturopaths.
('85', 271, 6, 16, 440247) You now fight shy of coming here.
('85', 271, 6, 17, 440281) I have been of the opinion that a naturopath should be so endowed that he can mix well with others and be completely free from pride and anger.

('85', 273, 3, 6, 442180) Such as it is all we have.

('85', 273, 3, 11, 442489) So I took recourse to my naturopathy.
('85', 273, 3, 12, 442527) There is very little room for going wrong in naturopathy.
('85', 273, 3, 13, 442585) Every day I only gain something.

('85', 275, 9, 21, 446442) SEVAGRAM, January 10, 1945 Dr. Indubhushan Bhingare had published earlier the first edition of Sant Tukaram ki Rashtragatha.
('85', 275, 9, 22, 446567) The present edition is the revised one.
('85', 275, 9, 23, 446607) My knowledge of Marathi is very slight.
('85', 275, 9, 24, 446647) I like Tukaram very much.
('85', 275, 9, 25, 446673) But I could read only a few of his abhangas without effort.I therefore passed on Dr. Bhingares selection to Kundarji Diwan who took great pains to go through the whole thing.
('85', 275, 10, 26, 446848) 1 Romain Rolland died on December 30, 1944, in Vezelay, France.

('85', 276, 1, 3, 447018) Dr. Bhingare had selected a cheap one.
('85', 276, 1, 4, 447057) It hurt me very much.
('85', 276, 1, 5, 447079) I sent it to Shri Nandalal Bose, the renowned Santiniketan artist.
('85', 276, 1, 6, 447146) He has been kind enough to send me four pictures of Tukaram to go with the abhangas.
('85', 276, 1, 7, 447231) I sent the one that I thought the best among them to Bhingare and it will be published in this edition.

('85', 276, 4, 13, 447482) January 10, 1945 The Ishavasya gripped me during my Harijan tour of Travancore.
('85', 276, 4, 14, 447562) All my speeches invariably included the first verse of this Upanishad: All that is pervaded by God.
('85', 276, 4, 15, 447662) It all belongs to Him, therefore nothing belongs to you.
('85', 276, 4, 16, 447719) But in a way it is yours too.
('85', 276, 4, 17, 447749) But why get caught in the argument?
('85', 276, 4, 18, 447785) Renounce all, and all is yours.
('85', 276, 4, 19, 447817) Nothing will remain in your hands if you regard anything as yours. This was the note with which I concluded my Travancore tour and I felt that I had come by a treasure.
('85', 276, 4, 20, 447986) I told Vinoba and requested him to give me a simple Hindi rendering of the Ishavasya.
('85', 276, 4, 21, 448072) As is his wont he granted my request.

('85', 276, 8, 30, 448379) Your falling ill is not good and is contrary to our pact.
('85', 276, 8, 31, 448437) Dying is not an ideal.
('85', 276, 8, 32, 448460) Indulging in such things is false attachment.
('85', 276, 8, 33, 448506) You must free yourself from that.
('85', 276, 8, 34, 448540) Do preside over the meeting if you wish.
('85', 276, 8, 35, 448581) But your giving a lecture on the basis of a note sent from here is pointless.
('85', 276, 8, 36, 448659) You should give to the meeting what you have digested.

('85', 277, 1, 3, 448953) Your worrying about my health shows that you know neither God nor me.
('85', 277, 1, 4, 449023) If you knew God, you would realize that you, I and everyone else are solely in His hands.
('85', 277, 1, 5, 449113) If you knew me, you would know that I take every possible precaution.
('85', 277, 1, 6, 449183) There are lapses nonetheless, but what can one do about it.
('85', 277, 1, 7, 449243) However, I am maintaining good health.
('85', 277, 1, 8, 449282) Under any circumstances you need not worry.
('85', 277, 1, 9, 449326) I repeat you may come any time you wish.
('85', 277, 1, 10, 449367) You have nothing to do with the 26th of January.
('85', 277, 1, 11, 449416) You are all the time doing that work.

('85', 278, 4, 6, 450366) Q. What are your arguments in favour of this plan?
('85', 278, 4, 7, 450417) A. After my talks with Jinnah, Jinnah told many people that Gandhi had not even mentioned Interim Government.
('85', 278, 4, 8, 450527) Bhulabhais effort is a reply to this.
('85', 278, 4, 9, 450565) But if the intentions of the League are not genuine, nothing will come out of it.

('85', 280, 2, 3, 452554) SEVAGRAM, January 11, 1945 2
('85', 280, 3, 4, 452583) ZAKIR SAHEB, ARYANAYAKUMJI, SHRIMATI ASHADEVI AND BROTHERS AND SISTERS, I had hoped to speak a few words while opening this Conference, but God had willed otherwise.
('85', 280, 3, 5, 452749) I had to observe silence because of a cough, and other things.
('85', 280, 3, 6, 452812) Therefore I have written down what I wanted to say.
('85', 280, 3, 7, 452864) Although we have been working for Nayee Talim all these years, we have so far been, as it were, sailing in an inland sea which is comparatively safer.
('85', 280, 3, 8, 453015) We are now leaving the shoals and heading for the open sea.
('85', 280, 3, 9, 453075) So far our course was mapped out.
('85', 280, 3, 10, 453109) We have now before us uncharted waters, with the Pole Star as our only guide and protection.
('85', 280, 3, 11, 453202) That Pole Star is village handicrafts.
('85', 280, 3, 12, 453241) Our sphere of work now is not confined to Nayee Talim of children from seven to fourteen years; it is to cover the whole of life from the moment of conception to the moment of death.
('85', 280, 3, 13, 453424) This means that our work has increased tremendously.
('85', 280, 3, 14, 453477) Yet workers remain the same.
('85', 280, 3, 15, 453506) But that should not worry us.
('85', 280, 3, 16, 453536) Our guide and companion is Truth which is God.
('85', 280, 3, 17, 453583) He will never betray us.
('85', 280, 3, 18, 453608) But Truth will be our help only if we stand by it regardless of everything.
('85', 280, 3, 19, 453684) There can be in it no room for hypocrisy, camouflage, pride, attachment or anger.
('85', 280, 3, 20, 453766) We have to become teachers of villagers; that is to say, we have to become their servants in the true sense.
('85', 280, 3, 21, 453875) Our reward if any, has to come from within and not from without.
('85', 280, 3, 22, 453940) It should make no difference to us whether in our quest for Truth we have any human company or not.
('85', 280, 3, 23, 454040) Nor does Nayee Talim depend on outside financial help.
('85', 280, 3, 24, 454095) It must proceed on its own way, whatever critics might say.
('85', 280, 3, 25, 454155) I know that true education must be self supporting.
('85', 280, 3, 26, 454207) There is nothing to feel ashamed of in this.
('85', 280, 3, 27, 454252) It may be a novel idea if we can make good our claim and demonstrate that ours is the only method for the true development of the mind.
('85', 280, 3, 28, 454388) Those who scoff at Nayee Talim today will become its ardent admirers in the end and Nayee Talim will find universal acceptance.
('85', 280, 4, 29, 454516) 1 The four day conference, attended by more than 200 educationists, was held under the presidentship of Zakir Husain, who read out Gandhijis speech.

('85', 281, 0, 1, 454693) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 282
('85', 281, 1, 2, 454735) Seven lakhs of our villages, which are today the symbol of our poverty in every sense, ought to become prosperous in the real sense.
('85', 281, 1, 3, 454868) This prosperity will not come from outside; it will grow from within the villages as a result of the labour of every villager.
('85', 281, 1, 4, 454995) Whether this is a mere dream or a practical reality, this is the goal of Nayee Talim and nothing short of it.
('85', 281, 1, 5, 455105) May the God of Truth help us to realize it.
('85', 281, 1, 6, 455149) I have gone through the balance sheet of the Talimi Sangh.
('85', 281, 1, 7, 455208) It shows that whatever we have spent has been spent with due care and consideration.
('85', 281, 1, 8, 455293) It is a brief document.
('85', 281, 1, 9, 455317) I hope everyone will go through it carefully.
('85', 281, 1, 10, 455363) The question of language as such does not fall within the scope of Nayee Talim but the question of the medium of instruction does and that must always be the mother tongue.
('85', 281, 1, 11, 455536) This point cannot be over emphasized.
('85', 281, 1, 12, 455574) Equally important is the question of a national or all India language.
('85', 281, 1, 13, 455645) It can never be English.
('85', 281, 1, 14, 455670) English is undoubtedly the language of the rulers and of international commerce.
('85', 281, 1, 15, 455751) But Hindi Hindustani alone can be our national language.
('85', 281, 1, 16, 455808) At present ithas two forms.
('85', 281, 1, 17, 455836) In order to understand both the forms of the national language, viz., Hindi and Urdu, and for their natural synthesis we must learn the Devanagari and Persian scripts.
('85', 281, 1, 18, 456004) I find this lacking even in my immediate surroundings.
('85', 281, 1, 19, 456059) All our sign boards 1 must be written in both the scripts and there should be none amongst us who cannot easily read and write either.
('85', 281, 1, 20, 456194) I want to draw your attention also to another thing.
('85', 281, 1, 21, 456247) I consider the Sevagram centre to be an ideal centre for conducting the central experiment in Nayee Talim, as it is here that the Charkha Sangh is carrying out its main experiments.
('85', 281, 1, 22, 456429) Wardha is the centre for the other village industries.
('85', 281, 1, 23, 456484) Experiments for the improvement of cattle, which is service of the cow in the true sense, are also being conducted here.
('85', 281, 1, 24, 456605) Sevagram does not stand alone; there are nearly 20 villages lying about it in close proximity.
('85', 281, 1, 25, 456700) Therefore if experiments in Nayee Talim in its most natural form can be carried out anywhere, it is here.
('85', 281, 1, 26, 456806) The various institutions mentioned above are not rival organizations; they are complementary and are calculated to supplement one anothers efforts.
('85', 281, 1, 27, 456954) That is the hallmark of a revolution of love.

('85', 282, 3, 4, 457182) I have no partiality for any militant programme for 26th January.
('85', 282, 3, 5, 457248) According to my idea, the constructive programme is the programme.
('85', 282, 3, 6, 457315) Therefore, it should be prosecuted with redoubled zeal.
('85', 282, 3, 7, 457371) Flag salutation with the reading of the independence pledge 3 has become an inseparable item.
('85', 282, 3, 8, 457465) It should, therefore, be retained.
('85', 282, 3, 9, 457500) But I would avoid mass gatherings and processions.
('85', 282, 3, 10, 457551) My advice should be followed only if it appeals to the head and the heart.
('85', 282, 3, 11, 457626) However, if the significance of the constructive programme has been properly understood, I am sure my advice will not fail to find a ready response.

('85', 284, 8, 16, 460588) Trust me to Gods mercy.
('85', 284, 8, 17, 460612) He will do as He wills.
('85', 284, 8, 18, 460636) Come soon.
('85', 284, 8, 19, 460647) You are a strong willed woman.
('85', 284, 8, 20, 460678) Is it not Gods grace that you have the strength to look after so many children?
('85', 284, 8, 21, 460758) For you look after them, feed them, and so on, while doing your other work.
('85', 284, 8, 22, 460834) Sita is getting along very well indeed.
('85', 284, 8, 23, 460874) She feels perfectly at home.

('85', 285, 3, 4, 461155) LILI, I have your letter.
('85', 285, 3, 5, 461181) I am daily getting stronger.
('85', 285, 3, 6, 461210) I was glad that this time you felt satisfied.
('85', 285, 3, 7, 461256) You served me with great devotion and have gone there well in time.
('85', 285, 3, 8, 461324) It does not matter if you have lost a day; you have not missed your lessons.
('85', 285, 3, 9, 461401) Even where you are, it is me you are serving.
('85', 285, 3, 10, 461447) Do your work in that faith.

('85', 285, 3, 12, 461503) You are violating dharma in desiring to leave before I do.
('85', 285, 3, 13, 461562) What would happen if all the workers did that?
('85', 285, 3, 14, 461609) I never said that the students should observe a strike on the 9th.
('85', 285, 3, 15, 461676) 1 On the contrary they should devote themselves all the more to service on that day.

('85', 286, 3, 5, 462944) It reads well on paper but it appears to me to be largely unpractical.
('85', 286, 3, 6, 463015) I feel that the new type is made of sterner stuff and is revolutionary in the true sense of the term.

('85', 286, 8, 16, 463564) The problem is medical only in a very small measure.
('85', 286, 8, 17, 463617) The deterioration will continue in spite of your medical effort.
('85', 286, 8, 18, 463682) You have to act humanely and boldly as men and not as mere medical volunteers.
('85', 286, 8, 19, 463761) You have to be of the masses and tell the rulers the truth.
('85', 286, 8, 20, 463821) The disease is starvation appearing as malaria and what not.
('85', 286, 8, 21, 463882) Outsiders will bring little relief, money will bring less.
('85', 286, 8, 22, 463941) Give the people milk and other food, their dwellings and their boats and I am positive that no medicine will be needed.
('85', 286, 8, 23, 464061) Your report makes me more and more eager to rush to Bengal and make common cause with the starving dumb masses.

('85', 288, 7, 10, 465732) We shall provide him no paraphernalia because the villagers themselves will supply the things.
('85', 288, 7, 11, 465827) The worker will keep a takli with him one made from bamboo will be the best.

('85', 291, 8, 34, 470411) But dont come merely because I ask you to.

('85', 292, 3, 5, 470805) I have already refused it to Gomati.
('85', 292, 3, 6, 470842) She understood.
('85', 292, 3, 7, 470858) What is so novel about your marrying within your caste?
('85', 292, 3, 8, 470914) Still, if you want my blessing you have it.
('85', 292, 3, 9, 470958) Never mind if you both belong to the same caste; both of you should break the barriers of caste.

('85', 292, 6, 24, 471715) I have noticed your virtues as I have also experienced your unsteadiness.
('85', 292, 6, 25, 471789) I am therefore a little wary of you.
('85', 292, 6, 26, 471826) But you must not be afraid of me, a satyagrahi.
('85', 292, 6, 27, 471874) For I will never interfere with your good work.

('85', 293, 2, 4, 472753) But there has been so much tyranny everywhere that I shirk going anywhere for health.
('85', 293, 2, 5, 472839) I have made an exception in favour of Panchgani for it is so near Bombay and especially Poona.
('85', 293, 2, 6, 472934) But I want to avoid even Panchgani if I can.
('85', 293, 2, 7, 472979) Thus if I do not go to Mysore or anywhere else you know why.
('85', 293, 2, 8, 473040) 2. As to the election I am not enamoured of them.
('85', 293, 2, 9, 473090) The more you avoid them the better.
('85', 293, 2, 10, 473126) The more you silently follow the constructive programme the nearer you are to swaraj.
('85', 293, 2, 11, 473212) But after all I have said, you must follow your own mind.
('85', 293, 2, 12, 473270) You may weigh, if you like all I say.
('85', 293, 2, 13, 473308) But my saying should never replace your mind.

('85', 295, 2, 3, 475659) P. M. What should the students do to strengthen the Congress?
('85', 295, 3, 4, 475721) G. The students must identify themselves with the aims and ideals of the National Congress and, by being part and parcel of it, they must continue to struggle against the foreign rule.
('85', 295, 4, 5, 475906) P.M. Should the students organizations have a separate identity or should they align themselves with the different political parties?
('85', 295, 5, 6, 476040) G. Students should do in this case what they think proper and advantageous for their organization and if experience proves otherwise, they must give up party affiliations.
('85', 295, 5, 7, 476212) Students should not indulge in unnecessary abuse of students belonging to a different ideology.
('85', 295, 5, 8, 476308) However, they must strengthen the Indian National Congress and prepare it for the final fight for freedom by doing silent service.

('85', 295, 8, 13, 476656) The Indian Students Congress embodies to some extent the faith and aspirations of students who are opposed to the attitude of the Communist section.
('85', 295, 8, 14, 476805) Here are some of our questions: Have we the right to exclude Communists and oppose their attitude and tactics?
('85', 295, 8, 15, 476916) Please do not tell us that this is a minor provincial question.
('85', 295, 8, 16, 476980) We want your guidance in this matter.
('85', 295, 8, 17, 477018) GANDHIJI: I dislike the idea of excluding anybody because of his label.

('85', 298, 2, 4, 480337) You have poured out your heart in it, which was the right thing to do.
('85', 298, 2, 5, 480408) You are still unsteady.
('85', 298, 2, 6, 480432) For the unsteadiness to go you must remain in the institution and give yourself wholly to it.
('85', 298, 2, 7, 480526) So it should be the same to you whether it is Jajuji or Chimanlal or I. You should obey the head whoever he be.
('85', 298, 2, 8, 480638) Therein lies your training.
('85', 298, 2, 9, 480666) If, however, that is not possible for you, I shall not mind if you two live together away from the Ashram.

('85', 298, 2, 14, 480953) Whatever you do, you should do together and with deliberation and determination.
('85', 298, 2, 15, 481034) Even while remaining in the institution you will continue to serve the people.
('85', 298, 2, 16, 481113) In fact you will then do it better.
('85', 298, 2, 17, 481149) But even here you must do as you think best.
('85', 298, 2, 18, 481194) If you wish me to guide you, you will of course have my guidance whenever you ask it.
('85', 298, 2, 19, 481280) If you can be more specific about the difficulties you mention, I may perhaps be able to solve them.
('85', 298, 2, 20, 481381) The irregularity you mention cannot be tolerated.
('85', 298, 2, 21, 481431) Give me the details.
('85', 298, 2, 22, 481452) If something is unavoidable we shall put up with it, but we will do that with our eyes open.
('85', 298, 2, 23, 481545) I can understand about Nanavati.
('85', 298, 2, 24, 481578) He is ill, but he is a tried worker.
('85', 298, 2, 25, 481615) I believe that one should not eat for the pleasure of the palate.
('85', 298, 2, 26, 481681) Chimanlal is an old timer.
('85', 298, 2, 27, 481708) Well or ill he has stuck on.
('85', 298, 2, 28, 481737) He goes on working silently.
('85', 298, 2, 29, 481766) You should have regard for his services.
('85', 298, 2, 30, 481807) The secret of good life is strictness with oneself and generosity to co workers.
('85', 298, 2, 31, 481888) Why need you keep anything private?

('85', 299, 3, 4, 482119) VASUMATI, I have your letter.
('85', 299, 3, 5, 482149) I had your previous letters too.

('85', 299, 3, 9, 482255) It is good you went.

('85', 299, 3, 11, 482310) Akbar will no doubt look after you.
('85', 299, 3, 12, 482346) It is all the better that you have not carried with you a lot of medicines.
('85', 299, 3, 13, 482422) A number of ailments disappear with very slight treatment.
('85', 299, 3, 14, 482481) It is superstition to insist on drugs.
('85', 299, 3, 15, 482520) Local herbs are a different matter.
('85', 299, 3, 16, 482556) For stomach ache one should fast, drink hot water and take hot water fomentation.
('85', 299, 3, 17, 482638) If there are loose motions fasting is imperative.
('85', 299, 3, 18, 482688) If the patient insists he may be given a pinch of soda bi carb or powdered neem leaves.
('85', 299, 3, 19, 482776) If anybody has a headache, he should have a mud pack on the head and drink lots of water and so on.
('85', 299, 3, 20, 482876) This is just to point the way.
('85', 299, 3, 21, 482907) Have patience, think for yourself, repeat Ramanama and persuade others to do so.

('85', 300, 7, 18, 484470) My hearty blessings to you.
('85', 300, 7, 19, 484498) Since you have the support of all the eminent Congressmen, if you are defeated it will be because the majority of graduate voters are not Congress minded.
('85', 300, 7, 20, 484653) It will also show that in your province at least the Congress hold on the educated men is not as great as it should be.

('85', 301, 2, 3, 485081) January 19, 1945 It was good you wrote.
('85', 301, 2, 4, 485121) You could have said all that in one paragraph.
('85', 301, 2, 5, 485168) Brevity is an art.
('85', 301, 2, 6, 485187) If you cultivate that art you will have a means of achieving steadiness of mind.
('85', 301, 2, 7, 485268) Of course, if you cannot be brief, you have to say what you must, even if you are long winded.
('85', 301, 2, 8, 485363) I understand about privacy.
('85', 301, 2, 9, 485391) 1 The reason you give does not appeal to me.
('85', 301, 2, 10, 485436) Let critics say what they like.
('85', 301, 2, 11, 485468) I shall, however, respect your wish so long as it remains your wish.
('85', 301, 2, 12, 485537) I do not wish that you should hide Chimanlals defects as long as you see any in him.
('85', 301, 2, 13, 485622) I only expressed my opinion.
('85', 301, 2, 14, 485651) It may perhaps be of some help.
('85', 301, 2, 15, 485683) The same about Nanavati.
('85', 301, 2, 16, 485708) What you say surprises me.
('85', 301, 2, 17, 485735) I would ask him further if he were here.
('85', 301, 2, 18, 485776) I do think he will come back.
('85', 301, 2, 19, 485806) It would be good if you addressed brief notes to those who make mistakes or shirk work.
('85', 301, 2, 20, 485894) I only wish to help.
('85', 301, 2, 21, 485915) But would it not make it difficult to improve things if I did not mention what you wrote, did not know the names nor what lapses had occurred?
('85', 301, 2, 22, 486058) You should have definite work.
('85', 301, 2, 23, 486089) I assume you have.
('85', 301, 2, 24, 486108) But if that is not so, I am willing to give you whatever help you ask for.
('85', 301, 2, 25, 486183) You should welcome any new suggestions I make.
('85', 301, 2, 26, 486230) They may seem new, but in fact they are not new.
('85', 301, 2, 27, 486279) They are at the very root of our way of life.
('85', 301, 2, 28, 486325) If I am not to make such suggestions, my presence here is useless.
('85', 301, 2, 29, 486392) How many of the suggestions I make can be implemented is of course another matter and that is for you to decide.
('85', 301, 2, 30, 486505) I was indeed very happy to read about brahmacharya.
('85', 301, 2, 31, 486557) 2 I believe it applies to both of you.

('85', 302, 3, 8, 487231) She likes the work very much.
('85', 302, 3, 9, 487261) She is taught by Sushilabehn and Prabhashanker.
('85', 302, 3, 10, 487309) Along with nursing, she also takes lessons in English, etc., from Bhansalibhai and others.
('85', 302, 3, 11, 487400) But she is still careless, I am not fully satisfied.
('85', 302, 3, 12, 487453) I had her sleep with me for three nights.
('85', 302, 3, 13, 487495) I wanted to continue the practice.
('85', 302, 3, 14, 487530) I would then have been able to correct her sleeping posture.

('85', 304, 5, 21, 490871) The illness is all gone.
('85', 304, 5, 22, 490896) The weakness is still there but he is slowly regaining lost strength and the whole day silence is serving as his strong shield.

('85', 305, 3, 5, 491518) What you say is correct.
('85', 305, 3, 6, 491543) The matter took a turn for the worse because the Government of Sind interfered.
('85', 305, 3, 7, 491623) They ought to withdraw the ordinance.

('85', 327, 12, 22, 520525) SEVAGRAM January 26, 1945 With the independence of India is bound up freedom for the whole of exploited humanity in the worldfor even exploiters i.e.,
('85', 328, 0, 1, 520676) VOL.85 : 2 OCTOBER, 1944 3 MARCH, 1945 329
('85', 328, 1, 2, 520719) imperialist England and other imperialisms.
('85', 328, 2, 3, 520763) Referring to an incident that occurred that morning in front of the Ashram, when the police attempted to interfere with the normal village cleaning programme of the workers, Gandhiji said that it had been repeatedly announced that there was to be no militant programme on the Independence Day and after that it was not possible for anyone to offer civil resistance.
('85', 328, 2, 4, 521129) Members of the various institutions in Sevagram worked under his guidance.
('85', 328, 2, 5, 521204) Gandhiji said he had placed the Constructive Programme before the country years ago and it was the only way of attaining swaraj, i.e., full freedom through truth and non violence.
('85', 328, 2, 6, 521384) While he did not want a militant programme he had also said that if anyone interfered with the execution of constructive work, he expected the people to die rather than turn back.
('85', 328, 2, 7, 521564) One such occasion arose that morning when a batch 1
('85', 328, 3, 8, 521616) proceeding mutely with pickaxes, shovels, broomsticks and baskets was stopped.
('85', 328, 3, 9, 521695) They were not carrying fighting weapons and yet the police would allow them to proceed only if they broke up file.
('85', 328, 3, 10, 521810) In such circumstances, non violence would be sheer cowardice if they yielded and bent before authority.
('85', 328, 3, 11, 521914) Their hymn for that evening was exceptionally appropriate, Gandhiji continuing said, and its central theme was, that true happiness lay only in the womb of unhappiness.
('85', 328, 3, 12, 522083) For the hearers it meant that true happiness, i.e., swaraj, came only through unhappiness, i.e., self suffering.
('85', 328, 3, 13, 522196) The volunteers did right in refusing to break up file and at the same time not breaking through the police cordon.
('85', 328, 3, 14, 522311) Though the police had fire arms they were rendered useless through the dignified and yet firm attitude of the volunteers.
('85', 328, 3, 15, 522433) 2 They were neither to invite firing nor avoid it and for them real authority was the dictate of their hearts which Gandhiji would call God or Truth.
('85', 328, 3, 16, 522583) For me, true independence is convertible with God.
('85', 328, 3, 17, 522634) Tilak has given a mantra that Swaraj is our birthright.
('85', 328, 3, 18, 522690) It is a simple one.
('85', 328, 3, 19, 522710) I will only add that the way to realize the mantra is through truth andnon violence and I claim that that way is possible only if millions work the Constructive Programme.
('85', 328, 3, 20, 522882) Concluding, Gandhiji warned the volunteers not to gloat over their success, for, if they did so, that very pride would prove their destruction.
('85', 328, 3, 21, 523026) Humility, he said, should be their touchstone.

('85', 330, 6, 13, 524842) I have made some arrangement for the newspapers.
('85', 330, 6, 14, 524891) You want other newspapers besides the Bombay papers.
('85', 330, 6, 15, 524944) Even among the Bombay papers you do not get the Chronicle on the same day.
('85', 330, 6, 16, 525019) Many persons want it, and it is not possible to refuse them.
('85', 330, 6, 17, 525080) The same is true about the Patrika.
('85', 330, 6, 18, 525116) You will get both of them but late.
('85', 330, 6, 19, 525152) And if you get the Gujarati, Hindi and Marathi papers, you ought not to insist on the English ones.
('85', 330, 6, 20, 525252) If I could have your whole letter shown to the persons concerned it would have made my task easier.
('85', 330, 6, 21, 525352) Since you have forbidden it I have not shown it to anybody.
('85', 330, 6, 22, 525412) I do understand your problem, but I cannot offer you much guidance unless I go deeper into the matter.
('85', 330, 6, 23, 525515) What took place before me today was a spectacle worth watching.
('85', 330, 6, 24, 525579) Both of you had lost your tempers.
('85', 330, 6, 25, 525614) You were not aware of it, either of you.
('85', 330, 6, 26, 525655) Each could see the other partys error, but neither his own.

('85', 331, 1, 4, 526072) The atmosphere in Sevagram having become vitiated I do not wish that you should go there.
('85', 331, 1, 5, 526162) I myself am waiting and watching.
('85', 331, 1, 6, 526196) I have already suggested that it would be enough if someone from the Talimi Sangh goes.
('85', 331, 1, 7, 526284) He must be given the first place.
('85', 331, 1, 8, 526318) He may do what he can.
('85', 331, 1, 9, 526341) If he does not, then we shall see.
('85', 331, 1, 10, 526376) But I see that co workers have not been able to put up with your nature.
('85', 331, 1, 11, 526449) They cannot fully appreciate your worth.
('85', 331, 1, 12, 526490) I, therefore, do wish that since you both are now capable of observing brahmacharya even though living together and alone with each other, you should select a village within about four miles from here, settle down there and take up some work.
('85', 331, 1, 13, 526733) I will continue to guide you in whatever matters you wish.
('85', 331, 1, 14, 526792) So much for my wish.
('85', 331, 1, 15, 526813) The decision will have to be made by you two on your own, even if it should go against my wish.
('85', 331, 1, 16, 526909) You can use turmeric and salt.
('85', 331, 1, 17, 526940) I am not sure about pepper.
('85', 331, 1, 18, 526968) If anybody wishes to add it later, he may do so.
('85', 331, 1, 19, 527017) What the vaidya 1 says is for ordinary men and women.
('85', 331, 1, 20, 527071) In my view, a brahmachari should shun all these things, including even salt and turmeric.
('85', 331, 1, 21, 527161) If absolutely necessary, he may take them as medicine but not for the pleasure of the six flavours.
('85', 331, 1, 22, 527261) But I do not insist; I do not forbid them.
('85', 331, 1, 23, 527304) My observation may even be erroneous.
('85', 331, 1, 24, 527342) I have lived for more than forty years without condiments, and for nearly thirty without salt.
('85', 331, 1, 25, 527437) It might have been a mistake on my part.

('85', 334, 8, 18, 531469) You have time.
('85', 334, 8, 19, 531484) Write in Hindi to those who know Hindi, in Sindhi to Sindhis and to others in English if you so wish.
('85', 334, 8, 20, 531586) I have written to you that you may come by all means.
('85', 334, 8, 21, 531640) And in my opinion it would be better if Gokhale and Babaji also came.
('85', 334, 8, 22, 531710) Since it is all the same, why should we leave those two there?
('85', 334, 8, 23, 531773) They also look upon that place as a prison.
('85', 334, 8, 24, 531817) I have not sent them to jail.

('85', 337, 1, 3, 534502) A list of books with their prices will look more respectable.
('85', 337, 1, 4, 534564) I would like you not to take any help from Amritlal Sheth.
('85', 337, 1, 5, 534623) He will certainly send you whatever you ask for.
('85', 337, 1, 6, 534672) Your present need shows that this is not going to be your last request.
('85', 337, 1, 7, 534744) This is significant for me, for it shows how costly present day education is.
('85', 337, 1, 8, 534822) And at the end of it, you wont earn anything more than your livelihood.
('85', 337, 1, 9, 534894) I have heard of many doctors who are unable to make both ends meet.
('85', 337, 1, 10, 534962) Only a few have made good on their own strength.
('85', 337, 1, 11, 535011) A good many have had to resort to influence even after passing their examination.
('85', 337, 1, 12, 535093) In writing this it is not at all my purpose to persuade you to give up your study.
('85', 337, 1, 13, 535176) You must finish it now.
('85', 337, 1, 14, 535200) I do wish to suggest, though, that the knowledge you acquire at such a great cost should be used for service of the people.
('85', 337, 1, 15, 535324) I am glad that you are keeping Suru from the lure of ornaments, etc.
('85', 337, 1, 16, 535393) It remains to be seen how long you will succeed.
('85', 337, 1, 17, 535442) Let Bali 1 pay a visit to you, though I cannot bring myself to approve of it.
('85', 337, 1, 18, 535520) It will mean unnecessary expenditure over a long journey, with no benefit except momentary satisfaction.
('85', 337, 1, 19, 535625) But she has done a great deal for you.
('85', 337, 1, 20, 535664) She is a very affectionate woman.
('85', 337, 1, 21, 535698) Do, therefore, welcome her.

('85', 337, 1, 23, 535801) I have, however, permitted her to go to you.
('85', 337, 1, 24, 535846) You may come whenever you wish and live here as long as you like.
('85', 337, 1, 25, 535912) You have been doing excellent work as regards spinning, etc.
('85', 337, 1, 26, 535973) Keep up your strictness.
('85', 337, 1, 27, 535998) Sincere men, however few, are the best.
('85', 337, 1, 28, 536038) I should certainly like to go there, but somehow I do not feel the urge.

('85', 337, 1, 30, 536155) I do not know, though, what help he will give you.

('85', 337, 2, 32, 536242) I observe silence the whole day.
('85', 337, 2, 33, 536275) Give up the idea of going to Bombay.
('85', 337, 2, 34, 536312) Personally I should like you to remain where you are and learn all the four languages of the South.

('85', 339, 3, 5, 538054) The following appear to be the minimum qualifications for such workers: (1) Spinning of certain quantity of yarn regularly each month.
('85', 339, 3, 6, 538189) (2) Giving preference to such articles for personal consumption as are locally manufactured on the basis of cottage industries.
('85', 339, 3, 7, 538317) (3) To have full and active faith in non violence and truth as understood by Mahatmaji.
('85', 339, 3, 8, 538405) Mahatmaji, it is understood, told Mr. Sinha that the above test was good and it could easily be made stiffer.

('85', 339, 7, 12, 538594) BHULABHAI DESAI, I understand that the steps would be somewhat as follows : The League agrees with us as to the composition of the interim Government at the Centre.
('85', 339, 7, 13, 538759) (The agreed nominees will be responsible to the elected legislature.)The League agrees that if the proposal is accepted by the G[overnor] G[eneral] the first step to be taken by the new Government will be to release the Working Committee.
('85', 339, 7, 14, 538998) On this being done, the G. G. will be requested to accept the composition agreed upon (with the addition of members representing the elected parties or elements).
('85', 339, 7, 15, 539161) On the G.G. agreeing, an interim Government would be formed and when the Working Committee is thereafter released, you will be good enough to tell them that this step was taken with your approval.

('85', 340, 3, 4, 539985) Q. If the new provisional Government is formed while the Working Committee is still in detention and if the new Government releases them, why do you see danger in the way of a permanent solution of the Hindu Muslim question ?

('85', 341, 8, 26, 542274) I understand what you say regarding Bachu.
('85', 341, 8, 27, 542317) The sea is close to Ghogha and to Bhavnagar.
('85', 341, 8, 28, 542362) Will not its cooling effect be enough?
('85', 341, 8, 29, 542401) I shall consider how much I should leave over for you after Manubhai 2 and Vijaya 3 arrive.

('85', 342, 1, 2, 542796) 572. LETTER TO MUNNALAL G. SHAH February 1, 1945
('85', 342, 2, 3, 542845) MUNNALAL, You tried to be brief but failed.
('85', 342, 2, 4, 542889) I am sure you have omitted something.
('85', 342, 2, 5, 542927) To be brief means that you should say everything you want to in as few words as possible.
('85', 342, 2, 6, 543017) I will show you how to do this when I have the time and the opportunity to do so.
('85', 342, 2, 7, 543099) It was not in anger that I wrote what I did about Burhanpur.
('85', 342, 2, 8, 543160) I was not happy about you or Kanchan going there.
('85', 342, 2, 9, 543210) But knowing your limitation, I agreed unreservedly.
('85', 342, 2, 10, 543262) After you had gone there, I saw from your letters that your going there had been fruitful.
('85', 342, 2, 11, 543353) You made your family happy and you could also improve things to some extent.
('85', 342, 2, 12, 543430) Besides, there is certainly work to do in the town.
('85', 342, 2, 13, 543482) Hence, in order to see you become steady and have the proper environment, I also suggested your taking up work there.
('85', 342, 2, 14, 543600) My intention of course is that you should stay on here and learn through experience.
('85', 342, 2, 15, 543685) But evenfor doing that, you must have equipoise and you must live in conformity with social norms.
('85', 342, 2, 16, 543784) If you do not do that, you will not mature.
('85', 342, 2, 17, 543828) I, therefore, included that also in my suggestions.
('85', 342, 2, 18, 543880) You may forgive Gopalrao and others, but you must know their mistake.
('85', 342, 2, 19, 543950) I saw sarcasm in Pandurangs letter.
('85', 342, 2, 20, 543986) I did not like the letter.
('85', 342, 2, 21, 544013) Their explanation for all this lies chiefly in what you two, perhaps four, namely, you and Kanchan, Chimanlal and Shakaribehn, are by nature.
('85', 342, 2, 22, 544155) These two women cannot be considered different from other women.
('85', 342, 2, 23, 544220) Perhaps you do not know how many of my plans came to nothing because of Bas limitations.
('85', 342, 2, 24, 544309) I exercised as much strictness as I could.
('85', 342, 2, 25, 544352) But the limitation would always show itself.
('85', 342, 2, 26, 544397) You may be sure it will be the same in this case.
('85', 342, 2, 27, 544447) I have explained the rule to you.
('85', 342, 2, 28, 544481) If, after understanding it, you come to the conclusion that you two should run the Ashram, I would consent to your doing so.
('85', 342, 2, 29, 544606) Even if you run it in a way different from the way it is run at present, I would let you do so.
('85', 342, 2, 30, 544702) Or if you decide that the Ashram should be disbanded, I would consent to that too.
('85', 342, 2, 31, 544785) The correct and best thing would be that all four of you should wake up now while carrying on your present work, and do the best you can.
('85', 342, 2, 32, 544923) You may seek from me whatever help I can give you.
('85', 342, 2, 33, 544974) If Chimanlal also did not understand about Prahlad, ask me when I have free time and when both are present; I will tell you.
('85', 342, 2, 34, 545099) Writing about it will make the letter too long.
('85', 342, 2, 35, 545147) I will see about the newspapers.

('85', 343, 8, 22, 546205) I shall give the verdict if I get the claim of the T. M. E., your reply and the claimants rejoinder either in the national language or the State language or even in Marathi.

('85', 359, 3, 5, 566187) You can give Anand 1 mosambi juice in warm water.

('85', 359, 3, 7, 566325) You can give him honey mixed in hot water, or pure jaggery.

('85', 362, 1, 7, 570222) If the female parent has not that much discretion and regard for her husbands religion, the marriage becomes superficial.

('85', 362, 5, 22, 570905) My second suggestion is that you should cook jowar ghensh instead of dalia.
('85', 362, 5, 23, 570981) To cook ghensh the jowar should be turned into flour and the flour should then be cooked.

('85', 364, 6, 14, 573133) Let the three member committee stay, but Shantabehn should consult only you and you should take up the entire responsibility.

('85', 371, 9, 18, 582973) Those who have had Western education or those who are not craftsmen will not be inclined or eager to become craftsmen.
('85', 371, 9, 19, 583092) I have seen quite a number of such cases.
('85', 371, 9, 20, 583134) 2. Things will continue to happen sporadically.
('85', 371, 9, 21, 583182) They will not follow any sequence.

('85', 372, 2, 4, 583646) My interest in leper work is as old as my residence in South Africa.

('85', 372, 4, 10, 583947) February 10, 1945
('85', 372, 5, 11, 583965) Mahatma Gandhi addressed a few words to the gathering.
('85', 372, 5, 12, 584020) 3 He told them he had accidentally seen the address which they had presented to Shri Kanu Gandhi, the organizer of the camp.
('85', 372, 5, 13, 584145) They had said some very nice things in it, but if, as it often happened, it all began and ended with the presentation of the address, without their carrying back with them something of enduring value from the camp, theirs would be merely loves labour lost.
('85', 372, 5, 14, 584402) He expected them to develop what they had gained during their month of training a hundredfold and become true gramsevaks, servants of the villagers in deed as well as in name.
('85', 372, 5, 15, 584578) They had been selected for training out of a large number of applicants.
('85', 372, 5, 16, 584651) It was for them to vindicate their selection by going back as messengers and torch bearers of samagra gramseva to their respective provinces.
('85', 372, 5, 17, 584793) They should go to villages as scavengers and sweep them and clean them and serve the villagers as their humble servants.
('85', 372, 5, 18, 584914) They should teach those who wished to learn spinning and other village handicrafts in the best way they could.
('85', 372, 5, 19, 585025) They should never feel helpless in the absence of outside help.
('85', 372, 5, 20, 585089) In their work, if they had really assimilated the spirit of the teaching that had been imparted to them, it ought to develop their intellect and heart no less than their bodies.
('85', 372, 5, 21, 585267) Therefore it should develop their character.
('85', 372, 5, 22, 585312) Their success would depend more on the purity of their hearts than on their skill and knowledge.
('85', 372, 5, 23, 585409) If they lacked moral purity they would prove a blight instead of a blessing to the villagers among whom they might settle.
('85', 372, 6, 24, 585532) 1 T. N. Jagadisan, leprosy relief worker of Madras, and Dr. M. R. G. Cochrane of Vellore met Gandhiji and presented to him a proposal for organizing under the Kasturba Memorial Fund rural leprosy work for the benefit of women and children.
('85', 372, 6, 25, 585772) Since Gandhiji was observing silence he wrote out his reply.
('85', 372, 6, 26, 585833) 2 Vide also Remark in Visitors Book, 12 12 1944. 3 On the death anniversary, according to the Indian calendar, of Kasturba Gandhi, a twenty four hour spinning yajna was organized in which Gandhiji participated.
('85', 372, 6, 27, 586044) Kanu Gandhis Samagra Gramseva Shibir also concluded on this day.
('85', 373, 0, 1, 586109) THE COLLECED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 374
('85', 373, 1, 2, 586150) He was glad to note, Gandhiji went on, that though they came from different provinces, they had all been able to take and flourish on the same diet.
('85', 373, 1, 3, 586299) It should lead to a better realization of our oneness as a nation.
('85', 373, 1, 4, 586366) Customs, dress, food and language were bound to be to a certain extent different in different provinces, but the essential unity underneath this apparent diversity had to be fully grasped and a working uniform standard evolved if they were to realize their destiny as a nation.
('85', 373, 2, 5, 586644) Lastly, Mahatma Gandhi exhorted them all to learn Hindustani and acquire proficiency in both the Urdu and the Hindi scripts.
('85', 373, 2, 6, 586769) Hindustani meant not a highflown Sanskritized Hindi or Persianized Urdu, but a simple dialect which both Hindus and Muslims spoke in the villages of the North.
('85', 373, 2, 7, 586929) The villagers did not understandhighflown Hindi or Urdu.
('85', 373, 2, 8, 586986) Their language was either simple and plain Hindustani or a provincial dialect irrespective of their caste or creed.
('85', 373, 2, 9, 587102) Highflown and sophisticated style in Hindi and Urdu were the disease of cities, bred of mutual distrust.
('85', 373, 2, 10, 587207) So long as that state lasted it was incumbent on them to learn both the Hindi and Urdu scripts.
('85', 373, 2, 11, 587303) The third party was there no doubt to accentuate and exploit their differences, but, if they really felt that Hindus and Muslims were kith and kin, blood brethren, no one on earth could divide them or keep them divided.
('85', 373, 2, 12, 587523) There was a popular saying that it needed two to start a quarrel.
('85', 373, 2, 13, 587589) He was there to tell them that true ahimsa did not need to wait for a gesture from the other side.
('85', 373, 2, 14, 587688) If they understood their own part of the duty and acted accordingly, success would assuredly be theirs.

('85', 373, 4, 18, 588014) If this is so, it calls for serious reflection on our part.

('85', 376, 2, 5, 590989) After reading he should return it to me.
('85', 376, 2, 6, 591030) 1. In regard to myself, I have taken the position that even when [a particular form of personal service] may not be necessary a personmay be allowed to offer it after he has been told sojust for his satisfaction.
('85', 376, 2, 7, 591243) That is why I let the girls massage my legs.
('85', 376, 2, 8, 591288) I would not let any others do so.
('85', 376, 2, 9, 591322) I dont mind what Bhansali does, for I have complete faith in him.
('85', 376, 2, 10, 591388) Nobody is privileged.
('85', 376, 2, 11, 591410) Nobody can be privileged.
('85', 376, 2, 12, 591436) This must be clear.
('85', 376, 2, 13, 591456) 2. The responsibility for anything that you may permit Champa to do will be yours.
('85', 376, 2, 14, 591539) I will not guide you.
('85', 376, 2, 15, 591561) You are free to be as strict as you like.
('85', 376, 2, 16, 591603) I have told Champa that she may secure from you whatever liberty she wants, but must not ask for my permission, since the daily supervision over her is not mine.
('85', 376, 2, 17, 591765) 3. The Ashram manager should be a sthitaprajna, a gunatita 1 and a bhakta.
('85', 376, 2, 18, 591840) For this see Chapter II, XII and XIV [of the Gita].
('85', 376, 2, 19, 591892) 4. For learning English, why should anybody want to hear it read by someone else?
('85', 376, 2, 20, 591974) One may read it for oneself.
('85', 376, 2, 21, 592003) Bhansali may read from Ramakrishna and explain in Gujarati.
('85', 376, 2, 22, 592063) Nobody is forbidden to read English by himself.
('85', 376, 2, 23, 592111) One may learn any Indian language, and Bhansali may teach it.
('85', 376, 2, 24, 592173) I would never say that those who knew English should forget their knowledge, except perhaps sarcastically.
('85', 376, 2, 25, 592280) I myself know English and love the language.
('85', 376, 2, 26, 592325) But the language must be used only when necessary and not other wise.
('85', 376, 2, 27, 592395) 5. Omprakash should hand over his watch to the Ashram.
('85', 376, 2, 28, 592450) I think I shall be able to get Rs. 30 for it.
('85', 376, 2, 29, 592496) This would be the right thing to do.
('85', 376, 2, 30, 592533) But if O. prefers to pay that sum to the Ashram and keep the watch himself, he may do so.
('85', 376, 2, 31, 592623) 6. Certainly, it is ones duty to learn an Indian language, i.e., ones mother tongue.
('85', 376, 2, 32, 592708) 7. Ordinarily it is desirable that the class should be conducted at the place fixed for the purpose.
('85', 376, 2, 33, 592809) This has been written in Gujarati unconsciously.

('85', 378, 6, 13, 594993) MUNNALAL, A discussion was going on between Shakaribehn and you when I was in the bathroom.
('85', 378, 6, 14, 595085) Both of you were talking at the top of your voices.
('85', 378, 6, 15, 595137) The discussion was between you two only, and was not meant for anybody else to hear.
('85', 378, 6, 16, 595222) How can this be tolerated?
('85', 378, 6, 17, 595249) You should try and somehow learn to exercise control over your voice.
('85', 378, 6, 18, 595319) It is a matter of common sense how loudly one should talk on what occasion.
('85', 378, 6, 19, 595395) Please bear in mind that others will do what you do.
('85', 378, 6, 20, 595448) What you preach will be like so much writing on water.
('85', 378, 6, 21, 595503) You were to send me the dalia cooked at your place.
('85', 378, 6, 22, 595555) Did you forget to do so, or was the dalia not good enough to send?
('85', 378, 6, 23, 595622) Why not try to make ghensh or raab of jowar flour?
('85', 378, 6, 24, 595673) Are you afraid that nobody will like it?
('85', 378, 6, 25, 595714) Are all the people so fastidious?
('85', 378, 7, 26, 595748) Blessings from BAPU [PS] I have still to write about one thing more.

('85', 379, 5, 8, 596287) MUNNALAL, I tasted the dalia.
('85', 379, 5, 9, 596317) I had asked for a sample only from what was cooked in the kitchen.
('85', 379, 5, 10, 596384) What was sent had been left in the cooker for two hours.
('85', 379, 5, 11, 596441) It had puffed up but even then it tasted half cooked.
('85', 379, 5, 12, 596495) There were hard grains, and bran stuck in the mouth.
('85', 379, 5, 13, 596548) I think we cannot cook dalia from jowar as we can from wheat.
('85', 379, 5, 14, 596610) After the flour has been removed, no nutrient is left.
('85', 379, 5, 15, 596665) The jowar, therefore, should be turned into fine flour and soaked in water, and then ghensh or raab should be prepared from it.
('85', 379, 5, 16, 596793) Your reading of the Gita is too slow.
('85', 379, 5, 17, 596831) This also is an art.

('85', 380, 2, 4, 597482) It is not meant for others and it would not apply to servants.
('85', 380, 2, 5, 597545) It should apply to Ram Prasad; he is not an inmate of the Ashram.
('85', 380, 2, 6, 597611) Our Ashram is no more an ashram in the real sense.
('85', 380, 2, 7, 597662) But wherever I stay becomes a kind of an ashram.
('85', 380, 2, 8, 597711) I had even objected to calling it an ashram; but everybody started referring to it by that name and I acquiesced.
('85', 380, 2, 9, 597825) This does not in any way mean that those who have taken the vow can break it.

('85', 381, 5, 8, 599149) Write to her that Ram Narayan should make a confession in writing, exactly describing his role.
('85', 381, 5, 9, 599245) If doing so invites greater punishment, he should accept it.
('85', 381, 5, 10, 599306) That will be his atonement.
('85', 381, 5, 11, 599334) But he should do it only if it is acceptable to his mind and heart.
('85', 381, 5, 12, 599402) Notwithstanding what is said above, if there is any legal loophole and he can be acquitted, he should take the opportunity.
('85', 381, 5, 13, 599526) In his statement he should say that the statement is by way of atonement.
('85', 381, 5, 14, 599600) If there is a legal escape, he will certainly be freed.
('85', 381, 5, 15, 599656) The Government will not misinterpret his statement.

('85', 381, 8, 22, 600043) February 15, 1945
('85', 381, 9, 23, 600061) Referring to the amount of one crore and twenty four lakhs that had been collected, Gandhiji remarked that though he was impatient to speed up the work, he was not going to allow the Fund to be squandered away or loosely handled.
('85', 381, 9, 24, 600291) It had been collected in the name of an illiterate and simple hearted woman.
('85', 381, 9, 25, 600368) He had his detractors, not so Ba.
('85', 381, 9, 26, 600402) Therefore, the work done in her memory must be cent per cent honest.
('85', 381, 10, 27, 600471) 1 The addressee in her letter dated February 5, 1945, had mentioned that her husband, Ram Narayan Chaudhary, had in 1942 advised a student that sabotage activities would be in conformity with non violence and had now discovered, after Gandhijis clarification of the matter, that he was mistaken.
('85', 381, 10, 28, 600767) He was anxious to atone for the mistake.
('85', 381, 10, 29, 600808) 2 Gandhiji Addressed the Secretaries of the Provincial Committees of the Kasturba Gandhi National Memorial Fund.
('85', 382, 0, 1, 600921) VOL.85 : 2 OCTOBER, 1944 3 MARCH, 1945 383
('85', 382, 1, 2, 600964) did not care for numbers of workers.
('85', 382, 1, 3, 601001) If he could find even two capable men or women in the meeting he would begin work with their help and expand it as more suitable workers came forward.
('85', 382, 1, 4, 601152) So far as he was concerned he would like to exclude men altogether from the various Provincial Committees formed under the Trust and fill them with women.
('85', 382, 1, 5, 601307) But he would not have them unless they were at least as capable if not better than men.
('85', 382, 1, 6, 601395) Otherwise he would be exploiting them.
('85', 382, 1, 7, 601434) He had never done so.
('85', 382, 1, 8, 601456) One crore and twenty four lakhs was a mere drop in the ocean when distributed among seven lakhs of Indias villages.
('85', 382, 1, 9, 601572) India was spending more than a crore a day on the war, but one crore and twenty four lakhs for the service of women and children appeared a big sum in the eyes of everybody.
('85', 382, 1, 10, 601746) That gave only a measure of the topsyturvydom to which they had got used.
('85', 382, 1, 11, 601820) Referring to the way in which the money was to be spent, Gandhiji divided it into three heads.
('85', 382, 1, 12, 601915) The first in order was medical relief for women and children in the villages.
('85', 382, 1, 13, 601993) From the schemes that had come everybody seemed to think in terms of maternity homes and free hospitals for women and children.
('85', 382, 1, 14, 602121) He recognized the need of this kind of work but he frankly confessed that he had yet to feel his way to it.
('85', 382, 1, 15, 602229) What kind of medical institutions they were to have and what system of medicine they were to adopt was a ticklish question.
('85', 382, 1, 16, 602353) It was taxing his mind and he requested them all to give their serious attention to it.
('85', 382, 1, 17, 602441) So far as he was concerned, prevention is better than cure was his motto.
('85', 382, 1, 18, 602515) If he had his way he would make sanitation and hygiene work the principal activity under this head.
('85', 382, 1, 19, 602615) It did not matter if in doing so they had to exclude a certain class of hard and difficult cases.
('85', 382, 1, 20, 602713) Some of the patients might even die.
('85', 382, 1, 21, 602750) He could steel his heart to lose them.
('85', 382, 1, 22, 602789) But it broke his heart to see even one healthyman fall sick.Our village folk must be taught to look after their health.
('85', 382, 1, 23, 602909) The root causes were poverty and ignorance.
('85', 382, 1, 24, 602953) In order of importance these two came first.
('85', 382, 1, 25, 602998) Education was to be along the lines of Nayee Talim.
('85', 382, 1, 26, 603050) As a matter of fact, everything else was included in and was an essential part of Nayee Talim as he conceived its scope.
('85', 382, 1, 27, 603171) They had to better their economic condition through khadi and village industries.
('85', 382, 1, 28, 603253) Today, the sole occupation of woman amongst us was supposed to be to bear children, cook for her husband and otherwise drudge for the household.
('85', 382, 1, 29, 603398) This was a shame.
('85', 382, 1, 30, 603416) Not only was woman condemned to domestic slavery, but when she went out as a labourer to earn wages, though she worked harder than the man, she was paid less.
('85', 382, 1, 31, 603575) Children were forced to go to work at an early age.
('85', 382, 1, 32, 603627) Some of them worked often as much as the men but were paid even less than women.
('85', 382, 1, 33, 603708) This state of affairs must be put an end to.
('85', 382, 1, 34, 603753) He had received no scheme for this kind of work so far.
('85', 382, 1, 35, 603809) The children in the villages began to earn at an early age.
('85', 382, 1, 36, 603869) Their parents could not afford to send them to school and spend on their education like the city folk.
('85', 382, 1, 37, 603972) Their education should fit them for some useful industry or other and it should help to put them on their legs.
('85', 382, 1, 38, 604084) The work outlined by him was original and difficult.
('85', 382, 1, 39, 604137) There were very few men fit to carry it out.
('85', 382, 1, 40, 604182) Many of them even lacked the desire to train themselves for it.
('85', 382, 1, 41, 604246) Such men should not come on the Kasturba Gandhi National Memorial Fund Committees and if they were on them already they should resign and make way for others.

('85', 383, 1, 2, 604446) At the end, he invited questions but appealed to the audience to spare.
('85', 383, 1, 3, 604518) him as far as possible.
('85', 383, 1, 4, 604542) His energy was limited.
('85', 383, 1, 5, 604566) He observed silence, he told them, practically for the whole day these days from 3.15 a.m.
('85', 383, 1, 6, 604657) to 8.15 p.
('85', 383, 1, 7, 604668) He broke it for a short time during the meeting days.
('85', 383, 2, 8, 604722) A friend asked what should be considered the maximum population of a village.
('85', 383, 2, 9, 604800) Gandhiji replied that for the present he would set the outside limit at 2,000. This was subject to adjustments later on.
('85', 383, 2, 10, 604921) He knew an overwhelming majority of villages in India had a population between 500 and 1,000 or even less.
('85', 383, 2, 11, 605028) He would like them to begin with the smallest village and then work upwards.
('85', 383, 2, 12, 605105) He knew of some villages in Gujarat which were miniature towns.
('85', 383, 2, 13, 605169) Rich towns folk had gone and settled there with their wealth.
('85', 383, 2, 14, 605231) The money of the Fund was not to be spent on such villages.
('85', 383, 3, 15, 605291) Q. What means would you suggest for the economic uplift of the villagers?
('85', 383, 3, 16, 605365) A. True all round uplift of the villages cannot but result in their economic betterment.
('85', 383, 3, 17, 605454) Except maternity work, all the other items outlined by me would directly result in their economic uplift as well.
('85', 383, 4, 18, 605568) Q. If you were in charge of a district how would you set about the work?
('85', 383, 5, 19, 605641) A. A district is too big a bite for me.
('85', 383, 5, 20, 605681) If I can successfully organize work in one village I would be satisfied.
('85', 383, 5, 21, 605754) It will serve as a model for the rest of the seven lakhs of villages to follow.
('85', 383, 5, 22, 605834) We have not set about village work in right earnest so far.
('85', 383, 5, 23, 605894) We have only tinkered with it here and there amateurishly.
('85', 383, 5, 24, 605953) I myself was an amateur.
('85', 383, 5, 25, 605978) But now we are determined to do better.
('85', 383, 6, 26, 606018) Q. Some people engage in constructive work only as a side line to their political work.
('85', 383, 6, 27, 606106) The result is that they can do justice to neither.
('85', 383, 6, 28, 606157) There should be proper supervision to prevent it.
('85', 383, 7, 29, 606207) A. I entirely agree that constructive work and political work should not be mixed.
('85', 383, 7, 30, 606290) To me constructive work done properly is all sufficient.
('85', 383, 7, 31, 606347) It leaves no necessity for any other programme.
('85', 383, 7, 32, 606395) As for supervision, there is the old man who is your Secretary and the young woman, the Organizing Secretary of the TrustI mean Thakkar Bapa and Mridulabehn.
('85', 383, 8, 33, 606553) Q. Today the Provincial Committees have an overwhelming majority of men.
('85', 383, 8, 34, 606626) In how much time do you hope to be able to replace them by women?
('85', 383, 8, 35, 606692) A. I would, if I could, turn out all the men today and myself follow suit.
('85', 383, 8, 36, 606767) But I would take women on their merit, not merely because they were women.
('85', 383, 8, 37, 606842) If we could find suitable workers I would certainly wish to spend the money in our hands fairly fast.
('85', 383, 8, 38, 606944) Anyway, I do hope and expect that by the time the present fund is expended, women would have become capable of managing their own affairs.
('85', 383, 9, 39, 607083) Q. If you do not find suitable women workers, why should not the Fund be used
('85', 384, 0, 1, 607161) VOL.85 : 2 OCTOBER, 1944 3 MARCH, 1945 385
('85', 384, 1, 2, 607204) to train them up?
('85', 384, 2, 3, 607222) A. That is exactly our object and it is for that purpose that you are all here.
('85', 384, 2, 4, 607302) But everything must be done in a way befitting the memory of her in whose name the Fund has been collected.
('85', 384, 3, 5, 607410) Q. What is to be done in a province like Sind where it is too unsafe for any woman to venture out and work in the villages?
('85', 384, 4, 6, 607534) A. So long as women do not come forward, it goes without saying that men have to work in their place.
('85', 384, 4, 7, 607636) But I have no doubt that you should be able to find women to go to work in the villages.
('85', 384, 4, 8, 607725) Muslim women at any rate should have nothing to fear in Sind.
('85', 384, 4, 9, 607787) Anyway the worst that can happen to a woman is that she might lose her life.
('85', 384, 4, 10, 607864) I am convinced that no one can molest a woman if she has the determination and will to resist and is not afraid of dying.
('85', 384, 4, 11, 607986) I know of a young missionary girl who went all alone in the midst of Negroes inthe wilds of Africa.
('85', 384, 4, 12, 608086) Yet she was not afraid and no one ever cast an evil eye on her.
('85', 384, 4, 13, 608150) We have such women amongst us also.
('85', 384, 4, 14, 608186) One of them was with me only two days ago.
('85', 384, 4, 15, 608229) She went to Dacca all alone when Hindus and Muslims had run amok.
('85', 384, 4, 16, 608295) No one dared to touch her.
('85', 384, 4, 17, 608322) To enable women to shed their cowardice and to face danger undaunted should in fact be one of the results of our activity under the Kasturba Gandhi National Memorial Fund scheme.
('85', 384, 5, 18, 608501) Q. If we take up work just in one village the pressure of the surrounding area would swamp our work.
('85', 384, 5, 19, 608602) We cant make any headway unless we tackle the whole area at once.
('85', 384, 6, 20, 608668) A. My experience is different.
('85', 384, 6, 21, 608699) If we put off taking a necessary step till everyone else is ready for it we shall never make a move on.
('85', 384, 6, 22, 608803) We must have the courage to take the plunge even if we are all alone.
('85', 384, 6, 23, 608873) There are certain difficulties in the way but we have to overcome them.
('85', 384, 6, 24, 608945) Many of the difficulties that deter us are imaginary.
('85', 384, 6, 25, 608999) For instance, no one hinders my work here in Sevagram.
('85', 384, 6, 26, 609054) If I can only move the hearts of the people of Sevagram that is all that I need to do.
('85', 384, 6, 27, 609141) If we cannot succeed in one village we cannot possibly do so in a hundred.
('85', 384, 6, 28, 609216) Even if we can get a certain law passed by the State, who is going to enforce it in the villages unless there is awakening among the people themselves.
('85', 384, 6, 29, 609368) For that we have to begin with one village and then extend our field farther and farther.
('85', 384, 7, 30, 609458) Q. Those that are already doing constructive work are being drafted for work under the Kasturba Gandhi National Memorial Fund.
('85', 384, 7, 31, 609585) There are no new workers forthcoming.
('85', 384, 7, 32, 609623) In order to do justice to the Kasturba Gandhi National Memorial Fund work those who take up work under the Trust should not be burdened with other preoccupations.
('85', 385, 0, 1, 609786) THE COLLECED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 386
('85', 385, 1, 2, 609827) A. It is true that for many years we have not been able to draw sufficient fresh workers but Mridulabehn tells me that there is no dearth of women workers, if only the men folk remove the stranglehold.
('85', 385, 1, 3, 610029) I have told her that I would take her side and help her to produce as many women workers as she can.
('85', 385, 2, 4, 610130) Q. Many people who have collected large amounts for the Fund or have contributed substantially to it want to be included in the Provincial Committees.
('85', 385, 2, 5, 610281) Should we take them on?
('85', 385, 3, 6, 610305) A. The golden rule is that collecting money or contributing money should neither qualify nor disqualify a man from becoming a member of the Provincial Committee if he is otherwise fitted for it.But if anyone thinks that he has a right to be on the committee because of what he has contributed or collected, such a claim cannot be entertained and he should be excluded.
('85', 385, 3, 7, 610674) We must not have unwieldy bodies and we must not draw men who are already engaged in one sphere of work into another.
('85', 385, 3, 8, 610792) There are some men who are good at parliamentary work.
('85', 385, 3, 9, 610847) I would not like them to be stigmatized for it.
('85', 385, 3, 10, 610895) But if they leave it for something for which they have no aptitude merely because it is the fashion of the hour, I would take them to task for it just as I would take them to task if they sought to advance their parliamentary ambitions under cover of constructive work.
('85', 385, 4, 11, 611165) Q. The custom of slavery of women is still prevalent in some States.
('85', 385, 4, 12, 611234) Cant the Fund be used to do something for them?
('85', 385, 4, 13, 611282) Anyone who tries to help these women is clapped into prison under trumped up charges.
('85', 385, 4, 14, 611368) A. Send these women to me and I shall look after them.
('85', 385, 4, 15, 611423) They can all perform an exodus from the States where their elementary rights are denied.

('85', 385, 6, 21, 611742) My presence in Durgabehns room between 3 and 4.30 should be sufficient.
('85', 385, 6, 22, 611814) But if Bapa and others wish something else, please let me know.
('85', 385, 6, 23, 611878) The Mandal can meet for a longer time and carry on routine business.

('85', 386, 3, 4, 612131) BHAI LAKSHMI BABU, We cannot accept even one of the three conditions even though we concede that the speech was provocative.
('85', 386, 3, 5, 612256) The constructive programme of today has nothing to do with any movement such as that of 1942. Even if we are opposed to the violent activities of Shri Jayaprakash, we cannot accept any of the three conditions.
('85', 386, 3, 6, 612466) In other words, we shall not get those things done by coercion.
('85', 386, 3, 7, 612530) If freedom of India is common cause between us and the Government, why this discrimination ?
('85', 386, 3, 8, 612623) The truth of the matter is that the Bihar government has committed a mistake in arresting people 1 and instead of admitting the mistake, it wants to throw the responsibility on us.
('85', 386, 3, 9, 612804) We shall not accept that responsibility even if they destroy us.
('85', 386, 3, 10, 612869) Even if they seek to prevent us from carrying on our peaceful work, we shall march ahead.

('85', 388, 1, 2, 614556) 662. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS
('85', 388, 2, 3, 614584) WARDHA, February 17, 1945 I have delayed giving my opinion on the Bihar Governments challenge to Congress workers 1 in the hope that the storm was an isolated mistake and that it will correct itself.
('85', 388, 2, 4, 614784) I find I was mistaken.On top of the happenings in Bihar comes news that Shri Purushottamdas Tandon has been rearrested.
('85', 388, 2, 5, 614904) The workers in Bihar are well known, and of them one is an ex Prime Minister and another is ex Finance Minister.
('85', 388, 2, 6, 615017) Tandonji is the Speaker of the U. P. Assembly.
('85', 388, 2, 7, 615064) Now comes news that Shri Gopabandhu Chowdhury of Orissa, equally well known too, has been rearrested.
('85', 388, 2, 8, 615166) This is one picture.
('85', 388, 2, 9, 615187) The other is, the Viceroy holds talks with Sjt.
('85', 388, 2, 10, 615235) Bhulabhai Desai.
('85', 388, 2, 11, 615252) The air is thick with rumours of big changes.
('85', 388, 2, 12, 615298) The rumour hardly squares with the news I have summarized and which the public knows already.
('85', 388, 2, 13, 615392) Congressmen in Bihar were busy devising concerted measures to give effect to the fifteen point constructive programme sketched by me and in a manner suggested by me when the principal men were arrested though the programme has no political fIavour, using the term politics in its understood sense.
('85', 388, 2, 14, 615690) I have not hesitated to say that the universal adoption in practice in India of the programme must lead to the attainment of complete independence without either civil non violent disobedience or even a parliamentary programme.
('85', 388, 2, 15, 615918) There would then be no necessity for either.
('85', 388, 2, 16, 615963) The British would not find it worth while to stay in India to rule.
('85', 388, 2, 17, 616031) They would stay, if they do, as full citizens.
('85', 388, 2, 18, 616078) In the language of 1942, as rulers they would quit India; for their soldiers would be without occupation, their huge industries without use.
('85', 388, 2, 19, 616219) That day may not come, but it should be the non violent soldiers dream which he must try daily to realize and if in its pursuit he is thwarted, he has his non violent resistance to fall back upon, otherwise called civil disobedience and non co operation.
('85', 388, 2, 20, 616474) Mass civil disobedience is nobodys responsibility except, as yet, mine.
('85', 388, 2, 21, 616546) It was not offered in 1942. Nobody who has not permeated the masses can
('85', 388, 3, 22, 616618) 1 On January 28, 1945, the Bihar Government interned Srikrishna Sinha, ex Premier, Bihar, Anugraha Narayan Sinha, ex Finance Minister, Prof.

('85', 389, 0, 1, 616932) THE COLLECED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 390
('85', 389, 1, 2, 616973) shoulder it.
('85', 389, 1, 3, 616986) Indeed, the masses simply will not move.
('85', 389, 1, 4, 617027) That is my conviction based on the experience I have gained.
('85', 389, 1, 5, 617088) Hitherto the action in Bihar is defended on the ground of an alleged speech by Shri Prajapati Mishra.
('85', 389, 1, 6, 617190) The text of that speech has been suppressed.
('85', 389, 1, 7, 617235) There is no question of his or any Congressman making exciting speeches in the prosecution of the constructive programme or about non violent resistance or much less about resorting to violence or even approving of it.
('85', 389, 1, 8, 617454) That there is no plan under the present conditions to offer any form of mass civil disobedience has been clearly stated by me and I know that Congressmen all over the country are acting on the advice I have offered.
('85', 389, 1, 9, 617670) But abstention even from referring to the theoretical possibility of resistance and the like cannot be forced or even made a condition of prosecuting theconstructive programme.
('85', 389, 1, 10, 617847) It has undoubtedly independence political, social and economicas its aim.
('85', 389, 1, 11, 617921) It is a moral non violent revolution in all the departments of life of a big nation, at the end of which caste and untouchability and such other superstitions must vanish, differences between Hindu and Muslim must become things of the past, enmity against Englishmen or Europeans must be wholly forgotten and Princes and capitalists must live as perfect friends with the whole mass of India as the real and legal trustees of the people for all the wealth they may possess.
('85', 389, 1, 12, 618394) Is there anything wrong in the attempt?
('85', 389, 1, 13, 618434) What are Government protestations about Indian independence if they will not tolerate the movement I have sketched except on conditions impossible of acceptance?
('85', 389, 1, 14, 618596) Are they not satisfied with the extraordinary power they possess?
('85', 389, 1, 15, 618662) Must they keep without trial the best known as well as the least known Indians in their custody, lest the latter should preach independence from one end of the country to the other and non violent acts in pursuit thereof?
('85', 389, 1, 16, 618884) Must they rearrest released persons the moment they speak and act as free men, if their speech or act does not please the authority?
('85', 389, 1, 17, 619017) Another painful experience I am undergoing which I must share with the public is the number of reports of assault and torture resorted to for purposes of extorting confessions from prisoners.
('85', 389, 1, 18, 619209) Some cases are already before the public, such as the notable one at Kolhapur.
('85', 389, 1, 19, 619288) 1 Many other instances of comparatively recent occurrence have been brought to my notice.
('85', 389, 1, 20, 619378) One particular case I have in mind related to a young lad who, on my advice, gave himself up to the police because he had been wanted.
('85', 389, 1, 21, 619513) If some of the reports that one hears are not well
('85', 389, 2, 22, 619564) 1 It was alleged that Kashibai Hanbar was stripped and tortured by a police officer of Kolhapur State to extract information about her son who was declared a political absconder.

('85', 390, 1, 2, 619786) founded, I am satisfied several others are perfectly genuine.
('85', 390, 1, 3, 619848) Is it not time this practice of torture and ill treatment of people held in captivity is firmly discountenanced and put an end to by the powers that be?
('85', 390, 1, 4, 620001) In August 1942, instead of needlessly precipitating a quarrel with the people, if the authority had listened to the pleading of the Congress, India would have enjoyed independence and the war would have already ended with honour for the Allies and happiness for the suppressed peoples of the earth.
('85', 390, 1, 5, 620300) That is my retrospection.
('85', 390, 1, 6, 620326) If things go on as they are doing in India, the victory that the Allies will have will be only so called, because they will also have India and other nations in the same plight bleeding at their feet.
('85', 390, 1, 7, 620527) Such a victory can only lead in the near future to a bloodier war if possible than the one that will have closed.
('85', 390, 1, 8, 620641) For, as I have said elsewhere, victory won at the expense of India will mean that, out of the ashes of Fascism, Nazism and Japanese militarism will have risen a new monster that will seek to eat all it sees and in the attempt will be eaten up, leaving I know not what.
('85', 390, 1, 9, 620910) It has given me no pleasure to pen this statement.
('85', 390, 1, 10, 620961) There is much more I can say but I shall say no more for the present.

('85', 390, 3, 13, 621081) Narahari Parikh is one of those who joined the Satyagraha Ashram when it was first founded at Kochrab.
('85', 390, 3, 14, 621184) Whatever, therefore, Chi.
('85', 390, 3, 15, 621210) Vanamala has learnt, she has learnt at the Ashram.
('85', 390, 3, 16, 621261) She is untouched by any Government school and the education imparted there.
('85', 390, 3, 17, 621337) It can therefore be said that she knows how to work hard.
('85', 390, 3, 18, 621395) She has however gone out to collect material for Kasturbas biography.
('85', 390, 3, 19, 621465) In this she has also secured contributions from others.
('85', 390, 3, 20, 621521) Up to the time of writing I have not been able to look at these.
('85', 390, 3, 21, 621586) It was Chi.
('85', 390, 3, 22, 621598) Vanamalas wish that I should go through what she has written.
('85', 390, 3, 23, 621660) Poor girl, she would write about Kasturba but how could she forget me, with whom she romped around and played as a child?
('85', 390, 3, 24, 621782) I see she has painstakingly collected her facts and ordered them neatly.
('85', 390, 3, 25, 621855) Her language is homely and simple.
('85', 390, 3, 26, 621890) I see no artificiality in it.

('85', 390, 4, 32, 622254) This should be sent only if Narahari passes it.
('85', 390, 4, 33, 622302) In any case Vanamala must pass it.

('85', 391, 1, 3, 622399) Vanamala thought of taking something from this.
('85', 391, 1, 4, 622447) But on reading Sushilabehns account she found that Sushilabehns writing had a natural flow which she could not disturb.
('85', 391, 1, 5, 622567) The original is in Hindi and its Gujarati translation is reproduced in this collection.
('85', 391, 1, 6, 622655) Sushilabehn after all holds a doctors degree.
('85', 391, 1, 7, 622701) She has besides an interest in vocal and instrumental music, painting andliterature.
('85', 391, 1, 8, 622786) She takes interest in public affairs too.
('85', 391, 1, 9, 622828) The late Mahadev noticed these qualities of her and took a keen interest in them.
('85', 391, 1, 10, 622910) But he has departed from us.
('85', 391, 1, 11, 622939) His life is ended.
('85', 391, 1, 12, 622958) Readers should keep this in mind when they read Sushilabehns article.
('85', 391, 1, 13, 623028) So much for the authors.
('85', 391, 1, 14, 623053) But they both assert that if I myself do not say something about Ba the work will remain incomplete.
('85', 391, 1, 15, 623154) Since I am writing this foreword to the book perhaps it will be appropriate if I say something about Ba.
('85', 391, 1, 16, 623259) I certainly intend to write more fully about Ba when I have the time.
('85', 391, 1, 17, 623329) Here I shall only answer the question, if I can, why Ba was able to attract people to her.
('85', 391, 1, 18, 623420) Bas chief virtue was her voluntary identification of herself with me.
('85', 391, 1, 19, 623490) I did not draw her forth.
('85', 391, 1, 20, 623516) The quality blossomed in Ba on its own when the time came.
('85', 391, 1, 21, 623575) I never knew that Ba had this thing hidden in her.
('85', 391, 1, 22, 623626) My earlier experience showed her a very stubborn person.
('85', 391, 1, 23, 623683) If I tried to compel her in any way she would do exactly what she herself wanted.
('85', 391, 1, 24, 623765) This led to bitterness between usshort or prolonged.
('85', 391, 1, 25, 623818) But as my public life gradually developed, Ba blossomed more and more and freely merged herself in me, that is, in my work.
('85', 391, 1, 26, 623942) In time no distinction remained between me and my workwhich was service.
('85', 391, 1, 27, 624015) Ba too became one with that work.
('85', 391, 1, 28, 624049) This quality perhaps most naturally arises from the Indian soil.
('85', 391, 1, 29, 624114) At least that seems to me the chief reason for Bas sentiments.
('85', 391, 1, 30, 624177) The reason why this virtue reached its pinnacle in Ba is to be found in our brahmacharya.
('85', 391, 1, 31, 624267) It came more naturally to Ba than to me.
('85', 391, 1, 32, 624308) In the beginning Ba was not even aware of it.
('85', 391, 1, 33, 624354) The idea came to me and Ba took it up and made it her own.
('85', 391, 1, 34, 624413) In the result the relationship between us was as one between true friends.
('85', 391, 1, 35, 624488) Since 1906in fact since 1901all the time Ba was with me, she had nothing outside of my work.
('85', 391, 1, 36, 624581) She could have lived apart.
('85', 391, 1, 37, 624609) There would have been no difficulty in her living apart from me.
('85', 391, 1, 38, 624674) But being a friend she yet considered it her duty as a woman and a wife to merge herself in my work.
('85', 391, 1, 39, 624775) Ba gave the paramount place to the service of my person and till death never ceased from the task of attending on me.

('85', 396, 8, 18, 630770) As things stood, such a course was fraught with grave risk.
('85', 396, 8, 19, 630830) There was no atmosphere for it.

('85', 398, 7, 15, 632999) He will report to you in detail.
('85', 398, 7, 16, 633032) Liaquat Sahebs performances and things going on in the country frighten me.
('85', 398, 7, 17, 633108) 1 They should frighten you too.
('85', 398, 7, 18, 633140) Do what is just and proper.
('85', 398, 7, 19, 633168) It does not matter if the thing fizzles out.
('85', 398, 7, 20, 633213) 2 Once the consent of the Working Committee is obtained, the form you want to give it shall be all right.
('85', 398, 7, 21, 633319) Your English should harmonize with my Gujarati.

('85', 399, 3, 4, 633843) NARANDAS, Your statement is good.
('85', 399, 3, 5, 633877) Yes, organize a camp.
('85', 399, 3, 6, 633899) Everybody must pay the full amount, and that in advance.
('85', 399, 3, 7, 633956) That is what was done here.
('85', 399, 3, 8, 633984) Those who cannot pay may not come.
('85', 399, 3, 9, 634019) Dont mind that.
('85', 399, 3, 10, 634035) If such persons have influence with anybody in their areas, the latter may send the money.
('85', 399, 3, 11, 634126) If you permit outsiders to join, they will feel uncomfortable.
('85', 399, 3, 12, 634189) If any such persons turn up though not invited through a notice, consider at that time what to do.
('85', 399, 3, 13, 634288) You have not sent the conditions, etc., to be fulfilled by the candidates.
('85', 399, 3, 14, 634363) I should like to see them.
('85', 399, 3, 15, 634390) Bhai Kher 1 is undoubtedly a priceless jewel.
('85', 399, 3, 16, 634436) If your body cannot stand the strain do not take a leading part.
('85', 399, 3, 17, 634501) Prabhu 2 still keeps indifferent health.
('85', 399, 3, 18, 634542) He is going to Nagpur tomorrow to get himself examined.
('85', 399, 3, 19, 634598) He should, therefore, be spared at present.
('85', 399, 3, 20, 634642) Kanaiyo 3 is busy trying to finish his own work.
('85', 399, 3, 21, 634691) The speeches made are to be printed.
('85', 399, 3, 22, 634728) I have also suggested to him that he should take charge of the kitchen here.
('85', 399, 3, 23, 634805) He will be involved in that, too.
('85', 399, 3, 24, 634839) It will, therefore, be difficult for him to go there in the immediate future.
('85', 399, 3, 25, 634917) If a camp is started, I assume that Khersaheb will spend a month there.

('85', 400, 1, 5, 635579) If you do I shall be happy.
('85', 400, 1, 6, 635607) There are many other instances like the two you have mentioned.
('85', 400, 1, 7, 635671) There is no limit to my disappointments.
('85', 400, 1, 8, 635712) But a ray of immortal hope lies hidden among hundreds and thousands of disappointments.
('85', 400, 1, 9, 635800) 2 And so I am still sanguine in spite of the disappointments.
('85', 400, 1, 10, 635862) There may be more in store.
('85', 400, 1, 11, 635890) Whether or not what you write about Kanu and Narayan is correct, only experience will show.
('85', 400, 1, 12, 635982) I dont cling to that hope, either.
('85', 400, 1, 13, 636017) What if they too decide to go in for modern education?
('85', 400, 1, 14, 636072) I am prepared for all that.

('85', 400, 6, 30, 636810) But being a child she has forgotten about it.

('85', 401, 3, 6, 637513) There is no cause for it.
('85', 401, 3, 7, 637539) Nothing has been spoilt.
('85', 401, 3, 8, 637564) The matter has been talked out, which is only to the good.
('85', 401, 3, 9, 637623) We have got to look for the land.
('85', 401, 3, 10, 637657) All that has happened is that the matter has been somewhat delayed.
('85', 401, 3, 11, 637725) We are meeting in Bombay.

('85', 401, 3, 13, 637809) We dont want to keep anyone by force.
('85', 401, 3, 14, 637847) And would a forced association bring credit?
('85', 401, 3, 15, 637892) It is a stupendous task.
('85', 401, 3, 16, 637917) I am not at all scared even though it is mainly my work.
('85', 401, 3, 17, 637974) What you have created will of course go on.
('85', 401, 3, 18, 638018) I am not so much interested in it.
('85', 401, 3, 19, 638053) But I am certainly interested in what is being done in Andhra, because it islike village work.
('85', 401, 3, 20, 638148) Now I learn that even that has defects.
('85', 401, 3, 21, 638188) But if the finding is correct it is a great discovery.
('85', 401, 3, 22, 638243) I dont like your drawing conclusions so hastily.
('85', 401, 3, 23, 638292) If you persist in it you will not be able to achieve anything great.
('85', 401, 3, 24, 638361) Certainly you will not be able to serve the villages.
('85', 401, 3, 25, 638415) Please bear in mind that as from today you are in possession of the Sevagram land.

('85', 401, 3, 27, 638527) That experiment is to be conducted directly under my supervision.
('85', 401, 3, 28, 638593) You should understand the work being done and bring credit to it.
('85', 401, 3, 29, 638659) Only then can you be said to have made an advance.
('85', 401, 3, 30, 638710) However, for this you will have to take to simplicity.
('85', 401, 3, 31, 638765) I think the Bangalore venture is no good.

('85', 404, 7, 22, 642499) 689. TALK WITH DEVDAS GANDHI 2
('85', 404, 8, 23, 642530) SEVAGRAM, February 20, 1945
('85', 404, 9, 24, 642558) I told Bapu that Sjt.
('85', 404, 9, 25, 642580) Bhulabhai has received his letter regarding consultations with the Working Committee members.
('85', 404, 9, 26, 642674) I drew his attention to the fact that the above was there in his Gujarati draft, but was not there in Bhulabhais latest English draft.
('85', 404, 9, 27, 642809) Bapu said that the Gujarati draft only could be considered correct because the English version followed as an explanatory one.

('85', 405, 0, 1, 643024) THE COLLECED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 406
('85', 405, 1, 2, 643065) However Bapus independent opinion was that to meet and consult the Working Committee should be considered as an inevitable condition to act upon.
('85', 405, 2, 3, 643211) QUESTION : But if the new government releases the Working Committee immediately and at that time if the Working Committee is free to give its independent opinion, and at present as prisoners if they dont give any opinion, will it not be more beneficial ?
('85', 405, 2, 4, 643466) ANSWER: No.
('85', 405, 2, 5, 643478) In that case Bhulabhai will not be able to carry public opinion with him.
('85', 405, 2, 6, 643552) And also it will not be fair to the Working Committee.
('85', 405, 2, 7, 643607) Q. If it is possible to meet the Working Committee, will you accompany Bhulabhai or not ?
('85', 405, 2, 8, 643697) A. If Bhulabhai wishes so, I am prepared to go with him.
('85', 405, 2, 9, 643754) Q. Will you try to persuade the Working Committee to accept this plan ?
('85', 405, 2, 10, 643826) A. Yes.
('85', 405, 2, 11, 643834) Q. What are your arguments in favour of this plan ?
('85', 405, 2, 12, 643886) A. If the League is prepared to work together with the Congress in any way it is desirable.
('85', 405, 2, 13, 643978) After the Bombay talks, Jinnah has told many people that Gandhi did not even mention about the interim government.
('85', 405, 2, 14, 644093) Bhulabhais efforts are in themselves a reply to him.
('85', 405, 2, 15, 644146) But if the intentions of the League are not genuine, nothing will come out.
('85', 405, 2, 16, 644222) I am surprised at the Statement of Jinnah and Liaquat Khan.
('85', 405, 2, 17, 644282) In case Liaquat Khan has not even asked Jinnah, then it is a question how far we can rely on Liaquats talks.
('85', 405, 2, 18, 644391) Arrests have again started and that is a bad sign.
('85', 405, 2, 19, 644442) Now Bhulabhai must talk in a firm tone and tell the Viceroy that this will not do.
('85', 405, 2, 20, 644525) Q. Do we keep aside the question of the Viceroys veto ?
('85', 405, 2, 21, 644581) A. Bhulabhai says that it is a question of procedure and I have accepted it.
('85', 405, 2, 22, 644658) However, it means that the Government will not act with Viceroys veto against the vote of the Assembly.
('85', 405, 2, 23, 644762) Q. But if the Viceroy uses his veto and function ?
('85', 405, 2, 24, 644813) A. In that case there will be an understanding between Bhulabhai and Liaquat that the Government will resign.
('85', 405, 2, 25, 644923) Even now this fact must be made perfectly clear between them.
('85', 405, 2, 26, 644985) Q. On the basis of 4 4 2 will you even include the nationalist Muslims amongst the four of the Congress ?
('85', 405, 2, 27, 645091) But Bhulabhai should tell Liaquat that amongst his four he should take nationalist Muslims.
('85', 405, 2, 28, 645183) Q. Hindu Mahasabha ?
('85', 405, 2, 29, 645204) A. Viceroy will create Hindu Mahasabha and other such parties.
('85', 405, 2, 30, 645267) But we are not accepting them.
('85', 405, 2, 31, 645298) There are two parties Congress and League.
('85', 405, 2, 32, 645341) Sikhs and Harijans, we have accepted as a concession.
('85', 405, 2, 33, 645395) Q. Can we include persons like Shyamaprasad Mukherji amongst the four ?
('85', 406, 0, 1, 645467) VOL.85 : 2 OCTOBER, 1944 3 MARCH, 1945 407
('85', 406, 1, 2, 645510) A. If Bhulabhai wants to take them, then I would not raise any objection.
('85', 406, 1, 3, 645584) Q. If previous consultation with the Working Committee which is in jail is essential, then why should not the Working Committee members in jail form the Government ?
('85', 406, 1, 4, 645750) A. That time has not yet come.
('85', 406, 1, 5, 645781) At present the talk is only limited to Assembly members.
('85', 406, 1, 6, 645838) Q. But what about the Whites ?
('85', 406, 1, 7, 645869) A. The white, black, all only those who are appointed by the Congress and League can come, except the Commander in Chief.
('85', 406, 1, 8, 645991) Others will be responsible to them.

('85', 406, 4, 13, 646174) February 21, 1945
('85', 406, 5, 14, 646192) MUNNALAL, The programme on the 22nd 1 must be carried out.
('85', 406, 5, 15, 646251) They have already consulted me.
('85', 406, 5, 16, 646283) The Gita and spinning in the morning is the right thing, also the Ramayana.
('85', 406, 5, 17, 646359) I have never believed, let alone saying, any such thing about Kanchan as you attribute to me.
('85', 406, 5, 18, 646453) I did explain to you what I believed, and you have also accepted its truth.
('85', 406, 5, 19, 646529) Kanchan told Sushilabehn that she wants to live with you and have children.
('85', 406, 5, 20, 646605) I asked her on the very day she left and my impression is that she admitted that it was so.
('85', 406, 5, 21, 646697) If this is true, what you write is not correct.
('85', 406, 5, 22, 646745) My own view is that after having slept in the same bed with me once it was wrong to discontinue it through ignorance.
('85', 406, 5, 23, 646863) I did not know who forbade her.
('85', 406, 5, 24, 646895) I spoke neither to you nor to her about this.
('85', 406, 5, 25, 646941) I am mentioning this for the first time to you.
('85', 406, 5, 26, 646989) This is all I wish to say.My experiment, as you know, has been suspended.
('85', 406, 5, 27, 647063) If any woman comes to me now, she will do so not for the sake of my experiment but in order to receive from me the spiritual strength I possess.
('85', 406, 5, 28, 647208) I think I have such strength, though I am not sure whether I am right or wrong in my belief.
('85', 406, 5, 29, 647301) I have no fear at all that I may take unworthy advantage of anybody or violate my cherished vow.
('85', 406, 5, 30, 647398) You are wrong in believing that you are gaining nothing here.
('85', 406, 5, 31, 647460) But if such be your belief, now or later you must leave the Ashram.
('85', 406, 5, 32, 647528) To depend on servants for anything will be the fall of you both.
('85', 406, 5, 33, 647593) But we may engage for service a person whom we look upon as a brother or sister, with the object of helping him or her to advance in

('85', 407, 0, 1, 647763) THE COLLECED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 408
('85', 407, 1, 2, 647804) If he or she leaves us, we should do without him or her and carry on our work as best as we can.
('85', 407, 1, 3, 647901) I should welcome such a situation for myself.
('85', 407, 1, 4, 647947) We would then have neither money nor so called servants, but that would be a real test for us.
('85', 407, 1, 5, 648042) I have already been tested in this manner.
('85', 407, 1, 6, 648085) I have been discussing this with Kanubhai and trying to tempt him.
('85', 407, 1, 7, 648152) If he can give us the benefit of his recent experience and do something for us, all of you should welcome it.
('85', 407, 1, 8, 648262) I understand about the dalia.
('85', 407, 1, 9, 648292) If you send some, I will examine it.
('85', 407, 1, 10, 648329) I am still of the view that jowar grain should not be ground coarse and flour removed.
('85', 407, 1, 11, 648416) I think I have now said practically everything I wished to say.
('85', 407, 1, 12, 648480) Nor have I the time for more.
('85', 407, 1, 13, 648510) If there is anything left out remind me.

('85', 407, 6, 20, 648770) It is as well that while living in the Ashram we do not get involved in troubles.
('85', 407, 6, 21, 648852) Do participate in the discussions.
('85', 407, 6, 22, 648887) You have to do many other things for the Ashram, Do not buy books as long as you can manage with the books from the Library.

('85', 408, 7, 10, 649469) February 22, 1945
('85', 408, 8, 11, 649487) MUNNALAL, I understand about Kanchan.
('85', 408, 8, 12, 649525) My judgment approves of her opposition.
('85', 408, 8, 13, 649565) For you have observed no limit in harassing her and now you yourself tell her that from the social point of view your reason does not approve of the thing.
('85', 408, 8, 14, 649721) Kanchan is bound to interpret that you are opposed.
('85', 408, 8, 15, 649773) You also desire children, and that is why you cannot regard either yourself or Kanchan fit for brahmacharya.
('85', 408, 8, 16, 649882) You have tested yourself much.
('85', 408, 8, 17, 649913) I should advise you now to set up house separately so that both of you can be happy.
('85', 408, 8, 18, 649998) If you give up the thought of brahmacharya and live as a householder no harm will follow.
('85', 408, 8, 19, 650088) If you wish later to observe abstinence, you will be able to do so.
('85', 408, 8, 20, 650156) It seems to me that a separate establishment for you two and brahmacharya go ill together.
('85', 408, 8, 21, 650247) However, do what your heart bids.
('85', 408, 8, 22, 650281) Kanaiyo tells me that you like his suggestion.
('85', 408, 8, 23, 650328) I have made a few suggestions.
('85', 408, 8, 24, 650359) For two days he is going to Wardha.
('85', 408, 8, 25, 650395) When Sushila comes from Nagpur, he will return here.
('85', 408, 8, 26, 650448) Meanwhile, all of you may think things over.
('85', 408, 8, 27, 650493) In my absence you are bound to be under less pressure.
('85', 408, 8, 28, 650548) I understand about servants.
('85', 408, 8, 29, 650577) In this matter also you should regard my view only as a suggestion.
('85', 408, 8, 30, 650645) You should do whatever all of you like and think.
('85', 408, 8, 31, 650695) About newspapers, Ramprasad tells me that these days he himself gets them at half past one.
('85', 408, 8, 32, 650787) It would be better if you discussed the matter further with him.
('85', 408, 8, 33, 650852) If you can take charge of the newspapers, you may do so.
('85', 408, 8, 34, 650909) I would not at all advise you, though, to take it up.
('85', 408, 8, 35, 650963) However, have a talk with Pyarelal.
('85', 408, 8, 36, 650999) My desire to run away from here also has at the back of it the consideration of the convenience of you all.
('85', 408, 8, 37, 651107) But we need not think about this matter.
('85', 408, 8, 38, 651148) If it is to happen it will happen in the natural

('85', 409, 1, 3, 651246) And then neither I nor you nor anybody else will be able to stop it.

('85', 409, 5, 8, 651459) February 22, 1945 1. There is no need to make confessions to the Government or anybody.
('85', 409, 5, 9, 651547) One should certainly confess to friends.
('85', 409, 5, 10, 651588) If reparation can be made to those to whom damage was done, it should be made.
('85', 409, 5, 11, 651667) The institution in which they work should be informed.
('85', 409, 5, 12, 651722) In specific cases this advice can be modified.
('85', 409, 5, 13, 651769) 2. I must say as to this I am doubtful.
('85', 409, 5, 14, 651809) The above may be taken to apply here too.
('85', 409, 5, 15, 651851) 3. They can carry on constructive work on the above condition.
('85', 409, 5, 16, 651914) But if I am asked I shall still say that what they did was not right.
('85', 409, 5, 17, 651984) It is purely a moral question.
('85', 409, 5, 18, 652015) 4. I am afraid we cannot stop them.
('85', 409, 5, 19, 652051) Of course it would be good if they kept out.
('85', 409, 5, 20, 652096) 5. My answer is the same as above.
('85', 409, 5, 21, 652131) 6. In a way it remains the duty of the Congress to secure their release.
('85', 409, 5, 22, 652204) 7. The critics have not read my statement carefully.
('85', 409, 5, 23, 652257) I have condemned the deeds not the doers.
('85', 409, 5, 24, 652299) Violent acts have to be
('85', 409, 6, 25, 652323) 1 The questions answered in this note were forwarded to Gandhiji by the addressee in his letter of February 11. The questions were, briefly, as follows: (l) Some constructive workers who had indulged in sabotage in 1942 have repented and taken up constructive work.
('85', 409, 6, 26, 652589) Is it the duty of such workers to volunteer confessions to the police and be ready to accept punishment?
('85', 409, 6, 27, 652694) Or should they confess only to their friends and acquaintances?
('85', 409, 6, 28, 652758) (2) Some say they had been carried away into doing what they did and it is enough to regret it in their own hearts and get on with work.
('85', 409, 6, 29, 652895) Will this not be deceiving you?
('85', 409, 6, 30, 652927) (3) Some say they had acted in the belief that what they were doing was right and though the futility of it has become clear to them they see no reason for regretting what they did.
('85', 409, 6, 31, 653109) Can such workers take up constructive work?
('85', 409, 6, 32, 653153) (4) There are some people who have become too fond of violent activity.
('85', 409, 6, 33, 653225) They think if and when the people are ready for it, it should be taken up.
('85', 409, 6, 34, 653300) Since that is not so
('85', 410, 0, 1, 653321) VOL.85 : 2 OCTOBER, 1944 3 MARCH, 1945 411
('85', 410, 1, 2, 653364) condemned.
('85', 410, 1, 3, 653375) This should not be an obstacle to help being rendered to the concerned families.
('85', 410, 1, 4, 653456) 8. How can I stop ridicule?
('85', 410, 1, 5, 653484) The best way to stop it is to ignore it.
('85', 410, 1, 6, 653525) If this is inadequate, ask againbut only if it seems inadequate even after repeated readings.

('85', 410, 10, 18, 654018) Can such people be taken into organizations doing constructive work?
('85', 410, 10, 19, 654087) (5) Some want to use constructive work to mobilize people for violent revolution.
('85', 410, 10, 20, 654169) Will they have a place in such organizations?
('85', 410, 10, 21, 654215) (6) Is it the duty of the Congress to try and secure release of those convicted on charges of violence even if such people have not given up faith in the ways of violence?
('85', 410, 10, 22, 654387) (7) Some feel you were hasty in condemning acts of sabotage, that you have in a way disowned workers who had indulged in these acts, with the result that people have stopped giving help to their families.
('85', 410, 10, 23, 654592) What do you have to say?
('85', 410, 10, 24, 654617) (8) Some so called Gandhians in Maharashtra not only condemn violent activities but even make fun of them which hurts the dignity of young men who were involved in these activities.
('85', 410, 10, 25, 654799) Would you not want to stop them being ridiculed?
('85', 410, 10, 26, 654848) 1 The addressee explains that Gandhiji had selected one particular pen to autograph for him a photograph of himself and Kasturba Gandhi.
('85', 410, 10, 27, 654985) 2 The addressee had requested Gandhiji to translate into English the Daily Thoughts he wrote for him.

('85', 411, 1, 2, 655176) 696. SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING
('85', 411, 2, 3, 655206) SEVAGRAM, February 22, 1945 This day marks the end of a solar year since Bas departure from the earth.
('85', 411, 2, 4, 655309) According to the lunar calendar, the anniversary fell on Mahashivaratri Day.
('85', 411, 2, 5, 655386) 1 This is no occasion for mourning.
('85', 411, 2, 6, 655422) On the contrary, it should be celebrated with the same joy as a day of birth.
('85', 411, 2, 7, 655500) I do not make much distinction between birth and death.
('85', 411, 2, 8, 655556) The atman has neither birth nor death.
('85', 411, 2, 9, 655595) We loved Bas atman which is immortal.
('85', 411, 2, 10, 655633) We spend days like this outwardly in religious rites.
('85', 411, 2, 11, 655687) We had 24 hours non stop spinning.
('85', 411, 2, 12, 655722) To me it was a religious observance.
('85', 411, 2, 13, 655759) At Balvant Sinhas suggestion, we also have had the reading of the Ramayana which lasted throughout the day.
('85', 411, 2, 14, 655867) In the morning we recited the Gita.
('85', 411, 2, 15, 655903) But these outward acts do not satisfy us.
('85', 411, 2, 16, 655945) We should go through these rites with full consciousness and understanding and invoke God.
('85', 411, 2, 17, 656036) God is not somewhere up above or down below.
('85', 411, 2, 18, 656081) He is in our hearts.
('85', 411, 2, 19, 656102) In fact He is everywhere.
('85', 411, 2, 20, 656128) When scientists say that they can create a vacuum, what they mean is that a vessel can be emptied of air but something still remains.
('85', 411, 2, 21, 656262) Physical scientists have discovered thatthere is something subtler than air.
('85', 411, 2, 22, 656339) Those with religious leanings realize that God is everywhere and is witness to all our acts.
('85', 411, 2, 23, 656432) Yesterday, I said that we must first wipe out our sins.
('85', 411, 2, 24, 656488) There was a marriage celebration yesterday.
('85', 411, 2, 25, 656532) Five minutes before [the function] I went to inspect the latrine.
('85', 411, 2, 26, 656598) It smelled.
('85', 411, 2, 27, 656610) I found excreta uncovered.
('85', 411, 2, 28, 656637) Is this not a sign of our outer sin?
('85', 411, 2, 29, 656674) We are guilty of a great error in keeping the latrine thus.
('85', 411, 2, 30, 656734) We might have committed other sins as well.
('85', 411, 2, 31, 656778) We have, therefore, to see that our latrines and kitchens are absolutely clean.
('85', 411, 2, 32, 656858) We have to see that the kitchen runs smoothly; we must ask why we hurt one another, why the flies and mosquitoes breed.
('85', 411, 2, 33, 656978) All these are indicative of our sin.
('85', 411, 2, 34, 657015) I have not yet succeeded in finding out the cause of their growth but that does not absolve us of our sin.
('85', 411, 2, 35, 657122) On this sacred day we plied the charkha and observed many other religious ceremonies.
('85', 411, 2, 36, 657208) Now the test, whether we deserve to undertake it or not, lies in the fact whether we observe cleanliness or not.
('85', 411, 2, 37, 657321) You may not call it a sin, only a shortcoming.
('85', 411, 2, 38, 657368) But to me the two are the same.
('85', 411, 2, 39, 657400) We are punished for these sins not in the life to come but in this very life.
('85', 411, 2, 40, 657478) Viewed thus, life becomes simple and full of joy.
('85', 411, 3, 41, 657528) 1 Vide Speech at Sevagram, 10 2 1945.
('85', 412, 0, 1, 657566) VOL.85 : 2 OCTOBER, 1944 3 MARCH, 1945 413
('85', 412, 1, 2, 657609) I had a letter from Kanti.
('85', 412, 1, 3, 657636) He has mentioned what two learned persons said to him.
('85', 412, 1, 4, 657691) One of them said that he did not consider spinning to be a religious duty.
('85', 412, 1, 5, 657766) If he span, it was because it had become a convention to do so.
('85', 412, 1, 6, 657830) It is obvious that spinning in imitation of others cannot be termed a religious act.
('85', 412, 1, 7, 657915) Such spinning will not win us swaraj.
('85', 412, 1, 8, 657953) We will win it only if we understand its science and appreciate its potentiality.
('85', 412, 1, 9, 658035) Spinners who spin imitatively and therefore mechanically should not be found, of all places, in the Ashram.
('85', 412, 1, 10, 658143) Everyone here does not ply the charkha and I put up with it.
('85', 412, 1, 11, 658204) I cannot forbid those who spin just because others do.
('85', 412, 1, 12, 658259) But I may as well tell them that this is not going to help them achieve their aim.
('85', 412, 1, 13, 658342) The other learned person said that he did not believe in prayer.
('85', 412, 1, 14, 658407) It is not his fault.
('85', 412, 1, 15, 658428) The blame lies with us, for we, who believe in prayer, do not make our prayers manifest in our lives and actions.
('85', 412, 1, 16, 658542) He has warned that those who have gathered round me are not all genuine believers and that I am doomed to despair.
('85', 412, 1, 17, 658657) But I do not find any particular signs of despair in me.
('85', 412, 1, 18, 658714) I do my duty and speak of it to others.
('85', 412, 1, 19, 658754) But if they do not care to act on it, it does not affect me.
('85', 412, 1, 20, 658815) This learned friend gives discourses on the Gita, attends the prayer but he does so only because it is a convention.
('85', 412, 1, 21, 658932) If ones mind wanders during prayer and does not lose itself in meditation, it is clear that one does not fully participate in prayer not withstanding the physical presence.
('85', 412, 1, 22, 659105) There is in that case a conflict between the body and the mind in which the mind is the winner.
('85', 412, 1, 23, 659201) What I mean to say is that if we consider this to be a sacred day then we must with all our heart do all we can in the name of an old woman who, though unlettered, was an embodiment of purity.
('85', 412, 1, 24, 659394) Let all our actions be sincere.

('85', 416, 3, 7, 663273) Her condition was not so bad at the time she was put under your treatment.
('85', 416, 3, 8, 663348) On top of your medicine Chandi Prasad made her take a lot of milk.
('85', 416, 3, 9, 663415) Her condition further deteriorated.

('85', 417, 2, 3, 664299) February 24, 1945 With women men should behave as they would with men.
('85', 417, 2, 4, 664370) Two men would not deliberately embrace or kiss each other, or sleep together.
('85', 417, 2, 5, 664448) But if there is a reason, one man would touch another, sit by his side, or sit on the same seat.
('85', 417, 2, 6, 664545) We must behave with women in the same manner.
('85', 417, 2, 7, 664591) We must forget the distinction of sex as far as possible.
('85', 417, 2, 8, 664649) There is distinction between men and women but it should have no place in our normal dealings.
('85', 417, 2, 9, 664744) The consciousness of this distinction arises either in the case of carnal desire or outside it in that of a genuine desire for progeny.
('85', 417, 2, 10, 664880) Let us forget this second category.
('85', 417, 2, 11, 664916) Probably one in a million may be resorting to intercourse for purposes of procreation.
('85', 417, 2, 12, 665003) I have not come across any such person so far.
('85', 417, 2, 13, 665050) I do not consider association with women or keeping away from them in conformity with the conventional restraints of brahmacharya asrealbrahmacharya.
('85', 417, 2, 14, 665200) My relationships are covered by this explanation.
('85', 417, 2, 15, 665250) Whatever you may hear to the contrary must be rejected offhand.
('85', 417, 2, 16, 665314) Think of this instead of being curious about my relation ships.

('85', 418, 11, 20, 666915) The very basis of your argument is brute force.
('85', 418, 11, 21, 666963) How can I, therefore, reason with you?
('85', 418, 11, 22, 667002) According to me, the instances which you have cited may go against you.

('85', 423, 2, 3, 672090) AS AT SEVAGRAM, February 26, 1945 1
('85', 423, 3, 4, 672126) Q. In your letter 2 of September 14, 1944, to Mr. Jinnah, you said as follows: You, ask for my conception of the basis for a provisional interim government.
('85', 423, 3, 5, 672283) I would have told you if I had any scheme in mind. Did you never discuss even the outlines of any scheme during the course of your conversations?
('85', 423, 4, 6, 672429) A. What I told Quaid e Azam was the exact truth.
('85', 423, 4, 7, 672478) I had no idea of what he meant, for he never told me what he had in mind.
('85', 423, 4, 8, 672552) Therefore I can answer your question by saying we never discussed the outlines of any scheme of interim government except what I have said.
('85', 423, 5, 9, 672692) Q. In answering the first question, please refer to Mr. Jinnahs letter of September 14, in which he said, You, being the sponsor of this Gandhiji Rajaji formula, should give me some rough idea and picture of it so that I may understand what this part of the formula means. Did you give any reply to this?
('85', 423, 5, 10, 672997) If so, what?
('85', 423, 5, 11, 673010) If not, why not?
('85', 423, 6, 12, 673027) A. The foregoing answer deals with your second question.
('85', 423, 7, 13, 673084) Q. In his letter of September 17, Mr. Jinnah says that the word (Pakistan) has now become synonymous with the Lahore Resolution 3.
('85', 423, 7, 14, 673215) Did you ask him whether in accordance with the Lahore Resolution of the All India Muslim League, a scheme of Constitution, in accordance with the basic principles providing for the assumption finally by the respective regions of all powers such as Defence, External Affairs, Communications, Customs and such other matters as may be necessary, had been prepared?
('85', 423, 7, 15, 673577) Was your attention drawn to any such scheme by Mr. Jinnah?
('85', 423, 8, 16, 673636) Quaid e Azams position unfortunately was that while he could come as far as seeing me and trying to convince me of his position, he, the President of the League, could not discuss details with me, a mere individual.
('85', 423, 8, 17, 673852) But so far as I could gather from our conversations, he had no prepared scheme.
('85', 423, 8, 18, 673932) As the correspondence shows, he had referred me to two books both of which I read, but neither of which could help me to understand Quaid e Azams exactposition.
('85', 423, 8, 19, 674093) One thing he insisted upon was that if I first accepted the Pakistan of his conception, he could then discuss other things with me even though I was but an individual.
('85', 423, 9, 20, 674261) 1 From Gandhi Sapru Papers 2 Vide Letter to M. A. Jinnah, 14 9 1944. 3 Vide Resolution passed by All India Muslim League, 23 3 1940.
('85', 424, 0, 1, 674394) VOL.85 : 2 OCTOBER, 1944 3 MARCH, 1945 425
('85', 424, 1, 2, 674437) Q. Is it true that the real breakdown between you and Mr. Jinnah came about on the question of Central authority or Government?
('85', 424, 1, 3, 674565) Please refer in this connection to Mr. Jinnahs letter of September 25, 1 clause (d), in which he says, If these vital matters (suggested in the quotation from your letter with which clause d begins) are to be administered by some central authority, you do not indicate what sort of authority or machinery will be set up to administer these matters, and how and to whom again that authority will be responsible. Did you, at any stage, indicate to him that you wanted a Central Government or a Central Legislature to deal with a limited number of subjects, such as Foreign Affairs, Defence, Internal Communications, Customs, Commerce and the like?
('85', 424, 2, 4, 675211) A. It can be said that the breakdown took place because we could not come to an agreement of the two nation theory of Quaid e Azams.
('85', 424, 2, 5, 675344) As the correspondence will show I wanted to avoid a Central Government.
('85', 424, 2, 6, 675416) I suggested an authority acceptable to both the parties, but he would insist first on complete partition as between two nations and then an agreement between them as on foreign affairs, etc.
('85', 424, 2, 7, 675607) He would not agree to anything simultaneous.
('85', 424, 3, 8, 675652) Q. In that very clause (clause d), Mr. Jinnah says, According to the Lahore Resolution, as I have already explained to you, all these matters, which are the life blood of any State, cannot be delegated to any Central authority or Government. Then he says that the matter of security of the two States and the natural and mutual obligations that may arise out of physical contiguity will be for the constitution making body of Pakistan and that of Hindustan, or [any] other party concerned, to deal with on the footing of their being two independent States. Did you understand Mr. Jinnahs position to be that he intended that Pakistan and Hindustan should be completely independent sovereign States with no connection between them except by a treaty?
('85', 424, 3, 9, 676402) If so, did he tell you what was to happen if either party broke the treaty and what was the authority which could enforce the provisions of such a treaty?
('85', 424, 3, 10, 676557) A. Of course, he wanted two independent sovereign States with no connection between them except by a treaty.
('85', 424, 3, 11, 676666) If any party broke the treaty, the consequence would be what has happened throughout the world up till now, i e., war.
('85', 424, 3, 12, 676785) Therefore I did not ask and he did nottell me as to what would happen if either party broke the treaty.
('85', 424, 4, 13, 676889) Q. As regards the C. R. Formula 2, can you explain why Mr. Jinnah was opposed to clause (2) of that formula, which demanded a plebiscite of all the inhabitants on the basis of adult suffrage or other practical franchise?
('85', 424, 4, 14, 677110) Did you understand him to say that in the areas demarcated for Pakistan the minorities shall be given a chance of expressing their choice of staying in Pakistan or not being separated from the rest of the country?
('85', 424, 5, 15, 677324) 1 Vide Letter from M. A. Jinnah, 25 9 1944. 2 Vide Appendix C. Rajagopalacharis Formula, before 5 8 1942.
('85', 425, 0, 1, 677430) THE COLLECED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 426
('85', 425, 1, 2, 677471) A. Quaid e Azam would not have the plebiscite of the Muslims because he thought the League represented the Muslims of India and that the other communities should have no voice as to Pakistan which was Muslims exclusive right wherever they were in a majority.
('85', 425, 2, 3, 677730) Q. Please refer to your proposals contained in the letter of the 24th of September in which you said there shall be a treaty of separation which should also provide for the efficient and satisfactory administration of Foreign Affairs, Defence, Internal Communications, Customs, Commerce and the like, which must necessarily continue to be the matter of common interest between the contracting parties. Please explain how that treaty would provide for the efficient and satisfactory administration of these matters, and whether you contemplated any machinery which could give effect to the decisions embodied in that treaty.
('85', 425, 2, 4, 678354) If so, what is the nature of that machinery which you had in mind?
('85', 425, 3, 5, 678421) A. I suggested a board composed of representatives of both the States.
('85', 425, 3, 6, 678492) It was to be an arbitration board with administrative powers.
('85', 425, 3, 7, 678554) For the due carrying out of its decisions, it would largely or solely depend upon the goodwill of the parties or States.
('85', 425, 3, 8, 678675) But I should not object to a machinery jointly devised by the two States.
('85', 425, 4, 9, 678749) Q. Have you any objection to the provinces or States enjoying the fullest autonomy with residuary powers vested in them?
('85', 425, 5, 10, 678870) A. None whatsoever.
('85', 425, 6, 11, 678890) Q. How do you reconcile Mr. Jagat Narain Lals Resolution 1 of the All India Congress Committee with the line that you took in regard to the division of India in the course of your conversations and correspondence with Mr. Jinnah?
('85', 425, 7, 12, 679120) A. I depended first upon the decisive interpretation given by the President, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, and secondly on my own, meaning that the Jagat Narain Lal Resolution should be read together with the others bearing on the question.
('85', 425, 7, 13, 679356) For these latter were not cancelled by the Jagat Narain Lal Resolution.
('85', 425, 8, 14, 679428) Q. Please refer to Appendix C of the pamphlet known as Gandhi Jinmah Talks, and send to the Committee a short memorandum explaining any points in that summary which you may consider necessary.
('85', 425, 8, 15, 679621) In this connection please refer to your Press statement 2 dated September 28, 1944, in the course of which you stated as follows: In that respect the Lahore Resolution is quite sound.
('85', 425, 8, 16, 679805) Where there is an obvious Muslim majority, they should be allowed to constitute a separate State by themselves, and that has been fully conceded in the Rajaji Formula or my formula.
('85', 425, 8, 17, 679987) But if it means utterly independent sovereignty so that there is to be nothing in common between the two, I hold it is an impossible proposition.
('85', 425, 8, 18, 680133) That means war to

('85', 426, 1, 2, 680310) the knife. What did you mean by saying war to the knife, and why did you consider that proposition to be an impossible proposition?
('85', 426, 2, 3, 680442) A. War to the knife is a simple English idiom.
('85', 426, 2, 4, 680489) I have never known it used in the literal sense.
('85', 426, 2, 5, 680538) It simply means a determined quarrel between parties.
('85', 426, 2, 6, 680592) I hold that if there is nothing in common between the two or nothing which does not come in conflict with each others culture there can be no friendly mutual agreement.
('85', 426, 3, 7, 680761) Q. In your Press statement dated September 28, 1944, you said: I urge that apart from the two nation theory, if I could accept the principle of division of India in accordance with the demand of the League, he should accept it.
('85', 426, 3, 8, 680989) But unfortunately it was just there that we split. Please explain this more clearly.
('85', 426, 4, 9, 681074) A. I think I am explicit enough.
('85', 426, 4, 10, 681107) I meant that apart from conceding the two nation theory, I accepted the concrete suggestion of division of India as between members of the same family and therefore reserving for partnership things of common interest.
('85', 426, 4, 11, 681325) But Quaid e Azam would have nothing short of the two nation theory and therefore complete dissolution amounting to full sovereignty in the first instance.
('85', 426, 4, 12, 681480) It was just here that we split as I have said herein before.
('85', 426, 5, 13, 681541) Q. Are you prepared to admit that the Muslims in India are a separate nation?
('85', 426, 5, 14, 681619) If so, then why do you deny the Muslims the right of having a separate independentState?
('85', 426, 5, 15, 681708) If you are not prepared to admit that the Muslims are a separate nation, then on what principle do you agree to a division of India to the limited extent to which you seem to have agreed in the course of your conversation and correspondence with Mr. Jinnah?
('85', 426, 5, 16, 681966) In this connection, please refer to your interview to the News Chronicle on September 29, 1944, 1 which is printed at page 64 of the pamphlet known as Gandhi Jinnah Talks.
('85', 426, 5, 17, 682138) A. Although I could not agree to the two nation theory, I agreed on the basis of members of a family desiring severance of the family tie in matters of conflict but not in all matters so as to become enemies one of the other as if there was nothing common between the two except enmity.

('85', 427, 2, 3, 682642) WARDHA, February 26, 1945
('85', 427, 3, 4, 682668) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, I am glad to see you all assembled here at the invitation of Principal Shriman Narayan.
('85', 427, 3, 5, 682778) Dr. Abdul Haq was to have arrived here today, but he is now expected tomorrow.
('85', 427, 3, 6, 682857) This association and I wish to have his help.
('85', 427, 3, 7, 682903) Likewise Sjt.
('85', 427, 3, 8, 682917) Tandon was to come and I was feeling very happy.
('85', 427, 3, 9, 682966) Shriman Narayanji had wired to him also.
('85', 427, 3, 10, 683007) I am sorry that he is unable to come, being ill.
('85', 427, 3, 11, 683056) Let us hope that he will recover from his illness soon.
('85', 427, 3, 12, 683112) The task confronting you is, in one way, small, in another way big.
('85', 427, 3, 13, 683180) It is small because it requires only very small effort, and yet it promises great consequences.
('85', 427, 3, 14, 683276) Dr. Tarachand tells us that what is known by various names today was originally one language spoken in the North by both Hindus and Muslims.
('85', 427, 3, 15, 683417) It is a sad thing that those who were once one have become divided.
('85', 427, 3, 16, 683485) Their language, too, has either been split or is being split, into Urdu and Hindi.
('85', 427, 3, 17, 683568) As a result of the efforts of Sjt.
('85', 427, 3, 18, 683603) Tandon the Congress at Kanpur 2 gave the name Hindustani to the language which is spoken by both the communities and decided on two scripts, Devanagari and Urdu.
('85', 427, 3, 19, 683765) But the Congress could not implement the resolution.
('85', 427, 3, 20, 683818) In 1942, the Hindustani Prachar Sabha took up this work at the instance of the late Shri Jamnalal Bajaj but he passed away soon after.
('85', 427, 3, 21, 683953) In 1942, Congress leaders and others were arrested; I was among them.
('85', 427, 3, 22, 684023) I was released later on medical grounds.
('85', 427, 3, 23, 684064) Even during my illness I followed the progress of the work that was being done by Sjt.
('85', 427, 3, 24, 684151) Nanavati to propagate Hindustani.
('85', 427, 3, 25, 684185) It gave me joy to find that it held out the prospect of success.
('85', 427, 3, 26, 684250) I see no reason why what was at one time the common language of both Hindus and Mussalmans should not again become one.
('85', 427, 3, 27, 684370) In Northern India, we are the descendants of those Hindus and Muslims who spoke and wrote the same language.
('85', 427, 3, 28, 684479) It should not require even half the labour to revive that old common language than it would to create two different languages, Urdu and Hindi.
('85', 427, 3, 29, 684622) Village folk in Northern India, whether Hindus or Mussalmans, even today speak the same tongue and some even write the same language.
('85', 427, 3, 30, 684756) It is for you to decide what should be done to bring our labours to a successful completion.
('85', 427, 3, 31, 684849) The function of the Hindustani

('85', 428, 1, 2, 685062) Prachar Sabha is to implement your decisions.
('85', 428, 1, 3, 685108) I am sorry that, for reasons of health, I observe silence for the whole day so far as possible.
('85', 428, 1, 4, 685204) During the last three months I had to break my silence during day time only perhaps on three occasions.
('85', 428, 1, 5, 685308) Today, it being Monday, I am observing my weekly silence.
('85', 428, 1, 6, 685366) I hope that it will not interfere with our work.
('85', 428, 1, 7, 685415) I now leave the conference in your hands.
('85', 428, 1, 8, 685457) Shriman Narayan will conduct the rest of the proceedings.
('85', 428, 1, 9, 685515) Todays proceedings will go on in my presence till 5.30 p.
('85', 428, 1, 10, 685573) Tomorrow our work will commence at 3 p.
('85', 428, 1, 11, 685613) I shall then place my thoughts before you.

('85', 431, 11, 16, 689796) Please forgive me.
('85', 431, 11, 17, 689815) My silence continues for the whole day.
('85', 431, 11, 18, 689855) It is not that it cannot be broken.
('85', 431, 11, 19, 689891) But I want to continue it for as long as I can and smoothly carry on my work.
('85', 431, 11, 20, 689969) So I observe silence.
('85', 431, 11, 21, 689991) If I squandered my energy, I might collapse in a month.
('85', 431, 11, 22, 690047) My attachment to truth and non violence would not permit this.
('85', 431, 11, 23, 690110) But if necessity should arise I could spend this energy with both hands.

('85', 431, 11, 25, 690208) These days I have adopted the latter course.
('85', 431, 11, 26, 690253) I want to explain to you what the Hindustani Prachar Sabha is.
('85', 431, 11, 27, 690316) Its aim is to make as many people as possible learn Hindi and Urdu styles and the Devanagari and the Urdu scripts.
('85', 431, 11, 28, 690431) There was a time when the people of North India spoke one common language.
('85', 431, 11, 29, 690506) We are their descendants.
('85', 431, 11, 30, 690532) Today we see that the gulf between Hindi and Urdu is widening.
('85', 431, 11, 31, 690595) Protagonists of Hindi use difficult words from Sanskrit and

('85', 432, 1, 5, 690857) They will continue to speak the language which they have been used to speaking for years.
('85', 432, 1, 6, 690947) It is the task of people like me to stop Hindi and Urdu from running into separate orbits.
('85', 432, 1, 7, 691038) I shall say to both sides that the way adopted by them is not proper.
('85', 432, 1, 8, 691108) The villagers will not understand their bombastic words.
('85', 432, 1, 9, 691165) If we learn to write both the scripts, the two languages in the long run will become one.
('85', 432, 1, 10, 691255) The problem of script is not so complicated.
('85', 432, 1, 11, 691300) Let both the scripts continue for ever.
('85', 432, 1, 12, 691340) Or there is no objection if every province started writing the national language in its own script leaving aside these two.
('85', 432, 1, 13, 691464) But the language should be one.
('85', 432, 1, 14, 691496) Today we have become slothful.
('85', 432, 1, 15, 691527) Today we have on our heads the burden of English.
('85', 432, 1, 16, 691577) But English is also not so difficult.
('85', 432, 1, 17, 691615) We can learn English in six months.
('85', 432, 1, 18, 691651) But we want to learn to think in English and study the sciences.
('85', 432, 1, 19, 691716) So it takes time.
('85', 432, 1, 20, 691734) We waste as many as fourteen valuable years learning English and yet cannot master it.
('85', 432, 1, 21, 691821) Today if weask a teacher of English to express his ideas in Hindustani, he pleads inability.
('85', 432, 1, 22, 691914) Because of his education through English, he is not able to express his ideas in Hindustani.
('85', 432, 1, 23, 692007) Then how can he teach Hindustani to his students?
('85', 432, 1, 24, 692057) This is our sorry plight.
('85', 432, 1, 25, 692083) This also leads to lethargy.
('85', 432, 1, 26, 692112) We should not be afraid of learning two scripts.
('85', 432, 1, 27, 692161) Somebody might say that there are other eight or ten good scripts.
('85', 432, 1, 28, 692228) Why should we not learn them?
('85', 432, 1, 29, 692258) I do suggest that we learn at least one of the scripts of the South also.
('85', 432, 1, 30, 692332) There are four languages there.
('85', 432, 1, 31, 692364) You should not be frightened of them.
('85', 432, 1, 32, 692402) You are living in Hindustan.
('85', 432, 1, 33, 692431) If you want to serve your Hindustani brethren, why should you be afraid of the labour of learning at least two scripts?
('85', 432, 1, 34, 692551) We have to learn only one language.
('85', 432, 1, 35, 692587) It is our misfortune that we have to use two scripts.
('85', 432, 1, 36, 692641) But I would gladly learn all the languages of India.
('85', 432, 1, 37, 692694) If we have the interest, we shall not find the task too hard.
('85', 432, 1, 38, 692756) Today your number is very small, but it does not matter.
('85', 432, 1, 39, 692813) All of you must at any rate learn the two scripts.
('85', 432, 1, 40, 692864) I do not want to speculate on what splendid consequences would follow.
('85', 432, 1, 41, 692935) It is idleness which prevents one from learning other languages.
('85', 432, 1, 42, 693000) 1 If anyone comes to me, I can arrange for teaching him not only Hindustani but ten or twelve other important languages.
('85', 432, 1, 43, 693121) If anyone says I cant study Urdu (Hindustani), I would say you are unfit for staying in India as it is the language of many. I invited you for

('85', 433, 4, 10, 693822) WARDHA, February 27, 1945 Dr. Tarachand has poured out his heart while explaining the significance of the history of Hindustani words commonly used in the villages.
('85', 433, 4, 11, 693987) 1 I was not able to ask Tarachandji to finish soon because I myself was gripped by what he said.
('85', 433, 4, 12, 694084) He said things which he could have as well said at a gathering of pundits.
('85', 433, 4, 13, 694159) I am not a pundit.
('85', 433, 4, 14, 694178) However, I was listening with interest along with others.
('85', 433, 4, 15, 694236) He did not repeat anything and that is why I did not stop him.
('85', 433, 4, 16, 694299) 2 Later he narrated how he first joined the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan and left the Bharatiya Sahitya Sammelan after the Nagpur meeting, after which he took up the Hindustani work for making it the national language.
('85', 433, 4, 17, 694512) I want and desire real democracy even in this field.
('85', 433, 4, 18, 694565) I followed what Anand Kausalyayan said.
('85', 433, 4, 19, 694605) He spoke hesitantly.
('85', 433, 4, 20, 694626) On behalf of the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan he said that the burden of two scripts should be avoided as far as possible.
('85', 433, 4, 21, 694743) Even today, I happen to be in the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan.
('85', 433, 4, 22, 694801) I did not go there on my own.
('85', 433, 4, 23, 694831) Jamnalalji used to drag me with him into whatever work he happened to do.
('85', 433, 4, 24, 694905) He took me to Indore 3 where I gave a new thing to the Sammelan.
('85', 433, 4, 25, 694970) They all digested it.
('85', 433, 4, 26, 694992) I said Hindi is that language which both Hindus and Muslims speak and which people write in both the scripts. The resolution moved by me was passed.
('85', 433, 4, 27, 695141) I had it included in the Sammelans constitution.
('85', 433, 4, 28, 695190) It is a different matter that it was later amended.
('85', 433, 4, 29, 695242) Hence I should not feel sorry if now I quit the Sammelan.
('85', 433, 5, 30, 695300) 1 This sentence is from The Hitavada.
('85', 433, 5, 31, 695338) 2 The rest of the paragraph is from The Hitavada.
('85', 433, 5, 32, 695388) 3 In April 1935
('85', 434, 0, 1, 695404) VOL.85 : 2 OCTOBER, 1944 3 MARCH, 1945 435
('85', 434, 1, 2, 695447) There are many among us who are trying to unify Hindi and Urdu.
('85', 434, 1, 3, 695511) Some wonder why it is necessary.
('85', 434, 1, 4, 695544) I want real democracy.
('85', 434, 1, 5, 695567) Democracy degenerates into hypocrisy if people become yes men.
('85', 434, 1, 6, 695630) That is why I asked them not to follow others blindly but express their true opinion.
('85', 434, 1, 7, 695716) I dont want Hindi to die nor Urdu to be banished.
('85', 434, 1, 8, 695766) What I wish is that both should become useful to us.
('85', 434, 1, 9, 695819) The law of satyagraha says that one can clap with one hand.
('85', 434, 1, 10, 695879) It may not produce sound, but what of that?
('85', 434, 1, 11, 695923) If you stretch one hand, the other one will follow automatically.
('85', 434, 1, 12, 695989) Haq Saheb had said something in Nagpur, which I could not then understand.
('85', 434, 1, 13, 696064) I did not accept his Hindi alias Urdu.
('85', 434, 1, 14, 696103) It would have been better if I had accepted his point.
('85', 434, 1, 15, 696158) He came for friendship, but was met with opposition and turned almost an enemy.
('85', 434, 1, 16, 696238) But I have no enemy.
('85', 434, 1, 17, 696259) Then, how can Haq Saheb be one?
('85', 434, 1, 18, 696291) That is why today we are again on the same platform.
('85', 434, 1, 19, 696344) An all India literary conference was held at Nagpur, but it was its first and last session.
('85', 434, 1, 20, 696436) We had gathered to come closer, but were divided.
('85', 434, 1, 21, 696486) What was the use of such a gathering?
('85', 434, 1, 22, 696524) It was a literary conference of all India not only Hindustani and so my speech on the occasion was full of Sanskrit words.
('85', 434, 1, 23, 696647) If I were again required to speak before such a gathering, I should speak the same language.
('85', 434, 1, 24, 696740) Anandji says that everybody will find great difficulty in learning two scripts.
('85', 434, 1, 25, 696820) I say there is no difficulty; and if there is, it will have to be overcome.
('85', 434, 1, 26, 696896) For, if this is not overcome, how shall we be able to face greater difficulties?
('85', 434, 1, 27, 696977) I live for Hindu Muslim unity.
('85', 434, 1, 28, 697008) I know the propagation of Hindustani will bring about this unity.
('85', 434, 1, 29, 697074) But I am not holding out this temptation right now.
('85', 434, 1, 30, 697126) I say, let Hindi and Urdu both prosper.
('85', 434, 1, 31, 697166) I have to take work from both.
('85', 434, 1, 32, 697197) Even today, Hindustani exists but we do not utilize it.
('85', 434, 1, 33, 697253) This is the age of Hindi and Urdu.
('85', 434, 1, 34, 697288) These are two streams from which the third will flow.
('85', 434, 1, 35, 697342) Hence it will not do if the first two dry up.
('85', 434, 1, 36, 697388) The villagers will follow my language.
('85', 434, 1, 37, 697427) They will not be able to follow a language which is full of Sanskrit and Arabic Persian words.
('85', 434, 1, 38, 697522) If those in the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan should say that they are going to sponsor a Sanskritized language, then, as far as I am concerned, the Sammelan does not exist.
('85', 434, 1, 39, 697689) The language of the villages is only one.
('85', 434, 1, 40, 697731) They cannot have two languages.
('85', 434, 1, 41, 697763) The champions of Hindi want me to blow the trumpet for Hindi only and to forget Urdu.
('85', 434, 1, 42, 697849) But I am a satyagrahi believing in ahimsa.
('85', 434, 1, 43, 697892) How can I do this?
('85', 434, 1, 44, 697911) I cannot do this work all alone.
('85', 434, 1, 45, 697944) I need everybodys help.
('85', 434, 1, 46, 697968) I am a mahatma precisely because I am aware of my limitations and never go beyondthem.
('85', 435, 0, 1, 698055) THE COLLECED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 436
('85', 435, 1, 2, 698096) is why Moulvi Abdul Haq has come.
('85', 435, 1, 3, 698130) I have no wings.
('85', 435, 1, 4, 698147) The veterans are called here so that they may give me wings.
('85', 435, 1, 5, 698208) If they do I shall soar high and say, Look, it is well done, is it not? Else I shall lie in the dust and stay there.
('85', 435, 1, 6, 698325) I am considered a big man also in the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan.
('85', 435, 1, 7, 698387) Not in that capacity, but in a general way, I would like to say that nothing will be done against the interest of the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan.
('85', 435, 1, 8, 698529) But people will have to take the trouble to learn both the scripts.
('85', 435, 1, 9, 698597) I want to take work from Anandji also.
('85', 435, 1, 10, 698636) I am told that the Muslim boys do not learn the Devanagri script.
('85', 435, 1, 11, 698702) I would say if it is so you have lost nothing but they have lost something.
('85', 435, 1, 12, 698778) What do you lose by learning one more script?
('85', 435, 1, 13, 698824) Such a little thing brings such a great gain.
('85', 435, 1, 14, 698870) I had said the same thing to Hasrat Mohani.
('85', 435, 1, 15, 698914) But it did not serve the purpose at that time, because a satyagraha had started.
('85', 435, 1, 16, 698995) I did not tell all of you to court arrest but I did.
('85', 435, 1, 17, 699048) It is not just foolishness on the part of those who are in jail.
('85', 435, 1, 18, 699113) Jawahar, Vallabhbhai and Maulana Saheb are already in jail.
('85', 435, 1, 19, 699173) They are not fools.
('85', 435, 1, 20, 699193) If they come out by resorting to flattery they will be dead in my eyes, and if they die during imprisonment, I shall not shed a single tear, I shall say they died a noble death.
('85', 435, 1, 21, 699371) Because while there, they serve India.
('85', 435, 1, 22, 699410) If Hindi and Urdu are unified Saraswati like the Hooghly will be bigger than the Ganga and the Yamuna.
('85', 435, 1, 23, 699513) The Hooghly is a dirty river, I do not drink its water.
('85', 435, 1, 24, 699569) But if this one becomes like the Hooghly it will be a grand river.
('85', 435, 1, 25, 699636) Now the question of funds.
('85', 435, 1, 26, 699663) Those who would like to contribute may give either to me or to Shriman Narayan.
('85', 435, 1, 27, 699743) Everybody should contribute according to his capacity.
('85', 435, 1, 28, 699798) Those who contribute may do so for the cause, not to gain fame.

('85', 436, 4, 8, 700498) February 28, 1945
('85', 436, 5, 9, 700516) MAGANBHAI, You will see that I have been able to correct up to page 13. The corrections are self explanatory.
('85', 436, 5, 10, 700626) From clause 8 onwards confusion has started.
('85', 436, 5, 11, 700671) It seems as if you felt tired or wrote piecemeal and the link was broken.
('85', 436, 5, 12, 700745) Clauses 8 to 12 relating to the work to be done do not seem consistent.
('85', 436, 5, 13, 700817) I have taken this up in haste soon after the prayer.
('85', 436, 5, 14, 700870) Maybe, therefore, I myself have got confused in my mind.
('85', 436, 5, 15, 700927) But I feel that you should have a separate paragraph, with a heading, for self purification.
('85', 436, 5, 16, 701020) This can come somewhere earlier.
('85', 436, 5, 17, 701053) What follows is useful but it should be said differently and arranged in a different manner.
('85', 436, 5, 18, 701146) I can do all this for you.
('85', 436, 5, 19, 701173) But I would have to spare more time for that, which I do not have.
('85', 436, 5, 20, 701240) Nor is it right that I should do your cooking for you.
('85', 436, 5, 21, 701295) It should be enough for me to tell you whether what you have done is done badly or indifferently.
('85', 436, 5, 22, 701393) Please, therefore, revise the whole of thatportion and, if you wish, show it to me.
('85', 436, 5, 23, 701477) But it will be all right even if you dont.
('85', 436, 5, 24, 701520) Reject what does not appeal to you from among the suggestions I have made.
('85', 436, 5, 25, 701595) Kishorelal is ill.
('85', 436, 5, 26, 701614) I myself will not trouble him.
('85', 436, 5, 27, 701645) I advise you also not to do so.
('85', 436, 5, 28, 701677) Do what you yourself can.
('85', 436, 5, 29, 701703) I am in better health than Kishorelal just now and so I have managed to do this much.
('85', 436, 5, 30, 701789) Otherwise I should have refused and also dissuaded you from approaching Kishorelal.
('85', 436, 5, 31, 701873) I have not revised this.

('85', 437, 7, 17, 702540) It does not matter if Kumarappa does not provide you the money.
('85', 437, 7, 18, 702604) But should you not have his consent to whatever you do?
('85', 437, 7, 19, 702660) If you carry on your activities on the strength of money when you dont have the consent of the institution to which you belong, it is sure to cause them some embarrassment.
('85', 437, 7, 20, 702833) If youcannot have Kumarappas consent you have only to have patience and try to persuade him.

('85', 440, 6, 12, 706132) DEAR FRIEND,
('85', 440, 7, 13, 706145) Yours of 15th inst.
('85', 440, 7, 14, 706165) Gandhiji writes in reply to your questions 2: 1. Quit India resolution 3 so called is wholly consistent with ahimsa and truth.
('85', 440, 7, 15, 706292) I hope you see nothing wrong in the phrase.
('85', 440, 7, 16, 706336) 2. There was no question of success partly or wholly resulting from the mere phrase or the resolution itself.
('85', 440, 7, 17, 706446) Evidently you have not studied the correspondence that led to the fast.
('85', 440, 7, 18, 706518) 4 It was wholly aimed at the misdeeds of the Government.
('85', 440, 8, 19, 706575) 1 This was written by Narahari Parikh.
('85', 440, 8, 20, 706614) The addressee was the Secretary General of the United Party of India.
('85', 440, 8, 21, 706684) 2 The questions, briefly summarized, were: (i) Whether the Quit India resolution was consistent with ahimsa and truth.
('85', 440, 8, 22, 706803) (ii) If it was, did Gandhiji realize any portion of his success from it or from his historic Linlithgow fast?
('85', 440, 8, 23, 706913) What was in his mind when he told Louis Fischer that he might not call off the civil disobedience movement even if there was violence?
('85', 440, 8, 24, 707048) (iii) Did it not show that he was not as firm about ahimsa as before the August 1942 movement?
('85', 440, 8, 25, 707143) (iv) Did it not show that freedom of the country was dearer to Gandhiji than ahimsa?
('85', 440, 8, 26, 707228) (v) Could not the counter violence of some of his associates be attributed to a decrease in his own faith in non violence?

('85', 441, 1, 2, 707525) The fast had great results.
('85', 441, 1, 3, 707553) You should study the whole event.
('85', 441, 1, 4, 707587) You should also know that a satyagrahi is never attached to results.
('85', 441, 1, 5, 707656) His acts, great or small, have their own worth.
('85', 441, 1, 6, 707704) My reply to Louis Fischer is complete.

('85', 441, 1, 8, 707815) Therefore, I said I might not call off the movement in future even if there was violence.
('85', 441, 1, 9, 707905) My trial never came.
('85', 441, 1, 10, 707926) For, I was arrested before I could start the movement.
('85', 441, 1, 11, 707981) 3. Certainly not.
('85', 441, 1, 12, 707999) 4. You are quite wrong.
('85', 441, 1, 13, 708023) I would never put freedom or anything before ahimsa and truth.
('85', 441, 1, 14, 708086) 5. It is clear to me that you have only superficially studied the movement as also ahimsa.
('85', 441, 2, 15, 708177) Gandhiji observes silence, and the above is a copy of what he has writer down.

('85', 442, 3, 4, 708810) PREMA, I am able to reach your letter only today.
('85', 442, 3, 5, 708860) I am helpless.
('85', 442, 3, 6, 708875) Do not trust the newspapers.
('85', 442, 3, 7, 708904) I have given no decision.
('85', 442, 3, 8, 708930) I have stated two views which seem contradictory.
('85', 442, 3, 9, 708980) The view that there should be no enrolment is the later one and is the result of fuller thought.
('85', 442, 3, 10, 709077) But nobody is forbidden to enrol members.
('85', 442, 3, 11, 709119) I have had no talk with Patil.
('85', 442, 3, 12, 709150) It is possible that Khurshedbehn or somebody showed me the resolutions.
('85', 442, 3, 13, 709222) But what does my consent mean?
('85', 442, 3, 14, 709253) Everybody, whether Gandhian or anti Gandhian, should act on his own responsibility.
('85', 442, 3, 15, 709337) One may say there is no such thing as Gandhism.
('85', 442, 3, 16, 709385) I have met Socialists more often.
('85', 442, 3, 17, 709419) Much of what they say has appealed to me.
('85', 442, 3, 18, 709461) Or you may say they have come closer to me.
('85', 442, 3, 19, 709505) But nobody should speak in my name.
('85', 442, 3, 20, 709541) I do not like people going underground but I do not condemn those who do.
('85', 442, 3, 21, 709615) It is the act of going underground that I condemn.
('85', 442, 3, 22, 709666) Understand the distinc tion.
('85', 442, 3, 23, 709695) There was no one with me during my talks with Jinnah Saheb.
('85', 442, 3, 24, 709755) 1 There were so few of us.
('85', 442, 3, 25, 709782) Rajaji was one.
('85', 442, 3, 26, 709798) The others didnt even know anything about it.
('85', 442, 3, 27, 709844) I understand all the rest.
('85', 442, 3, 28, 709871) But I do not have the time to go into the details.
('85', 442, 3, 29, 709922) Keep on the path you have chosen.
('85', 442, 3, 30, 709956) Get as many sincere women as you can and go on with the work.
('85', 442, 3, 31, 710018) Do not take upon yourself the burden of the whole country.
('85', 442, 3, 32, 710077) Take upon yourself only what you can do.
('85', 442, 3, 33, 710118) If there are any more questions you want to ask me you may.
('85', 442, 4, 34, 710178) Blessings from BAPU [PS] There has been no such thing as despair in my life and there never will be.
('85', 442, 4, 35, 710279) I would not despair even if everybody died.
('85', 442, 4, 36, 710323) What I am saying is right and what Bhulabhai is doing is also right.

('85', 443, 5, 6, 710848) MUNNALAL, I have read the whole thing.
('85', 443, 5, 7, 710887) It seems to me I shall have to pay attention to a few things.
('85', 443, 5, 8, 710949) I will not go too deeply into it.
('85', 443, 5, 9, 710983) Do not expect any help from me but accept whatever help I can give.
('85', 443, 5, 10, 711051) It is right that I should see my faults.
('85', 443, 5, 11, 711092) It keeps me vigilant.
('85', 443, 5, 12, 711114) In your view it is useless.
('85', 443, 5, 13, 711142) It would be good if we could start a separate catering service.
('85', 443, 5, 14, 711206) But that will not be possible.
('85', 443, 5, 15, 711237) By and large we should serve to the guests the same food that we cook for ourselves.
('85', 443, 5, 16, 711322) I understand about Kanchan.
('85', 443, 5, 17, 711350) It will be a triumph for you if you secure her testimonial.

('85', 443, 5, 19, 711437) Do not think that she is not fully awake.
('85', 443, 5, 20, 711479) To the extent that she is not, the fault lies with youand me.
('85', 443, 5, 21, 711541) I do not distrust you.
('85', 443, 5, 22, 711564) If I did, you would have left.
('85', 443, 5, 23, 711595) It should be for me to decide what work to assign to whom, dont you think?
('85', 443, 5, 24, 711670) Forget Sevagram means forget the village, not the Ashram.
('85', 443, 5, 25, 711728) In telling you that you may have a separate establishment I have shown that such a step has my consent and my encouragement.
('85', 443, 5, 26, 711853) If even then you do not do that, I shall take it as a matter of special credit to both of you.
('85', 443, 5, 27, 711948) I cannot bear the thought of your refraining from having a separate establishment under the slightest pressure from me.
('85', 443, 5, 28, 712068) Kanchan seems to wish to have one.
('85', 443, 5, 29, 712103) I do want you to play a major role in stabilizing the kitchen.
('85', 443, 5, 30, 712166) But you should do it my way.

('85', 444, 7, 14, 712944) March 1, 1945
('85', 444, 8, 15, 712958) VICHITRA, I am answering in pencil.
('85', 444, 8, 16, 712994) Later I shall have it copied out in ink.
('85', 444, 8, 17, 713035) The truth is that I want to make the beginning with the kind of person you mention.
('85', 444, 8, 18, 713119) If with his help we can achieve expansion, well and good, but if we cannot it will not matter.
('85', 444, 8, 19, 713214) Because in the long run only the new outlook can help us to expand the work.
('85', 444, 8, 20, 713291) If we stick to the old way, the work will come to a standstill.
('85', 444, 8, 21, 713355) Khadi will end up by being merely an occupation for the poor.
('85', 444, 8, 22, 713417) This will not satisfy anyone.
('85', 444, 8, 23, 713447) If workers have doubts in their hearts, we shall patiently have to remove them.
('85', 444, 8, 24, 713527) When I say that we should sincerely believe in the Charkha Sangh as the symbol of truth and non violence and dedicate ourselves to propagating the idea, it does not at all mean that what we had so far been doing was a mistake.
('85', 444, 8, 25, 713754) We have benefited from that too.
('85', 444, 8, 26, 713787) But it would be foolish to imagine that we can continue to do so, for we have certainly gained in knowledge.
('85', 444, 8, 27, 713896) If the new outlook destroys the fruits of our past work, then we have not understood the new outlook.
('85', 444, 8, 28, 713998) It is like the elephants foot that covers all other things.
('85', 444, 8, 29, 714058) Yes, what will

('85', 445, 1, 2, 714151) certainly happen is that we shall not be content any more to carry on in the old way and we shall be spared the outcry for expanding it.
('85', 445, 1, 3, 714288) We have some recent instances of this which I shall not go into here.
('85', 445, 1, 4, 714358) It will be false attachment if in our desire to expand the old we forget the new which is priceless.
('85', 445, 1, 5, 714459) It will be unbecoming, if obsessed with the old, we lose hold of the new.
('85', 445, 1, 6, 714533) If the old activity can be competently pursued by others they may by all means pursue it.
('85', 445, 1, 7, 714623) The question you ask as regards the institution I can answer only if you show me that it is not merely hypothetical but is based on facts.
('85', 445, 1, 8, 714762) We shall let the Punjab go ahead with the work if it can, provided we do not have to invest any funds.
('85', 445, 1, 9, 714865) There can of course be no question of not wearing khadi.
('85', 445, 1, 10, 714922) Women spinners may continue to spin.
('85', 445, 1, 11, 714959) How far we may commit funds for this is a practical question.
('85', 445, 1, 12, 715021) Each case can be dealt with on the basis of its own merits.
('85', 445, 1, 13, 715081) We should not invest any capital in silk and allied activities.
('85', 445, 1, 14, 715145) If, however, there are funds to spare and it is found beneficial to have stocks in khadi bhandars then we may have stocks of silks and woollens.
('85', 445, 1, 15, 715290) There must be the khadi spirit behind all this and we should ensure genuineness.
('85', 445, 1, 16, 715371) In the case of Kashmir, if the State does not impose upon us restrictions which we cannot accept, I should accept money from them under two conditions.
('85', 445, 1, 17, 715523) All the institutions should be prepared to lose their funds.
('85', 445, 1, 18, 715584) Maybe if the Charkha Sangh stakes its all nothing will be lost.
('85', 445, 1, 19, 715648) But they must do so on their own responsibility.
('85', 445, 1, 20, 715697) Whether the thing has my blessings or not should make no difference.
('85', 445, 1, 21, 715766) One must base oneself on the situation as it is.
('85', 445, 1, 22, 715815) It is indeed the duty of the Sangh to satisfy the public as well as the workers.
('85', 445, 1, 23, 715896) If however there is a higher duty, we must pursue it, too.
('85', 445, 1, 24, 715955) After all, khadi and all other work we have done has been informed only by this view.

('85', 445, 5, 29, 716142) SHRIPAD, What can be done if others become slack.
('85', 445, 5, 30, 716192) I find that those who have somebodys backing are able to carry on.

('85', 446, 1, 2, 716321) I merely mean that a Congressman will never go and beg.
('85', 446, 2, 3, 716377) Even though Congressmen may also have taken part in it, it was not a Congress movement.
('85', 446, 2, 4, 716465) Speeches and resolutions of the 7th and 8th 2 are a proof of this.
('85', 446, 2, 5, 716532) I alone could have launched the movement and I did not in any manner start it.
('85', 446, 2, 6, 716611) A wrong impression was created, no doubt.
('85', 446, 2, 7, 716653) But what of that?
('85', 446, 2, 8, 716671) See what Maulana Abul Kalam has to say.
('85', 446, 2, 9, 716711) Laying down ones life was not forbidden but violence was.
('85', 446, 2, 10, 716769) I have written much about parliamentary work.
('85', 446, 2, 11, 716815) Bari is here.

('85', 446, 6, 16, 716974) SEVAGRAM, March 1, 1945
('85', 446, 7, 17, 716998) KRISHNACHANDRA, I have your letter.
('85', 446, 7, 18, 717034) My experiment can succeed; it can also fail.
('85', 446, 7, 19, 717079) It can fail in the sense that I may not be able wholly to be free from passion.
('85', 446, 7, 20, 717159) In satyagraha there is no room for failure causing the least harm.
('85', 446, 7, 21, 717226) If my experiment is that of a satyagrahi, no harm at all can come to anyone.
('85', 446, 7, 22, 717303) I am answering in brief.
('85', 446, 7, 23, 717328) You may write to me again if you do not get the meaning.
('85', 446, 7, 24, 717385) I did have experiments with Ba, but that was not enough.
('85', 446, 7, 25, 717442) If emission took place then, it would have been less regrettable morally than any emission occurring now.
('85', 446, 7, 26, 717548) Emission was a possibility then.
('85', 446, 7, 27, 717581) I feel it is not a possibility now.
('85', 446, 7, 28, 717617) Occasion once came in my life when I came very near to emission.
('85', 446, 7, 29, 717682) But I was saved.
('85', 446, 7, 30, 717699) I have mentioned this in one of my articles.
('85', 446, 7, 31, 717744) This question gives me the impression that you do not understand the problem fully.
('85', 446, 7, 32, 717828) It is surprising that you asked the question without trying first to get the correct information from me.
('85', 446, 7, 33, 717934) What does it mean?
('85', 446, 7, 34, 717953) What kind of trust is this?
('85', 446, 7, 35, 717981) I do not have much time.
('85', 446, 7, 36, 718006) If you want to know, I shall acquaint you with the facts.
('85', 446, 7, 37, 718064) Then if questions occur to you that will be legitimate.

('85', 447, 3, 4, 718325) KRISHNACHANDRA, Your letter.
('85', 447, 3, 5, 718354) You should find your answer in my letter.
('85', 447, 3, 6, 718396) The idea is this.
('85', 447, 3, 7, 718414) I deliberately want to become a eunuch mentally.
('85', 447, 3, 8, 718463) If I succeed in this then I become one physically also.
('85', 447, 3, 9, 718519) That alone is true brahmacharya.
('85', 447, 3, 10, 718552) I saw an opportunity and seized it.
('85', 447, 3, 11, 718588) If it is satyagraha it can never cause physical harm, nor even moral harm.
('85', 447, 3, 12, 718663) That is to say, it can only do good.
('85', 447, 3, 13, 718700) This is what experience proves.
('85', 447, 3, 14, 718732) What can happen when a bad person meets a good person?
('85', 447, 3, 15, 718787) If my conduct is trusted there can be no harm, whoever may be my associate.
('85', 447, 3, 16, 718863) This in any case must be clear.
('85', 447, 3, 17, 718895) My reference is not to 35 years but 21 years.

('85', 447, 7, 22, 719104) DEVIPRASAD 2, I deal with your letter today.
('85', 447, 7, 23, 719149) You cannot categorically say either that I would or would not come on a full moon day.
('85', 447, 7, 24, 719236) My going there or not going there would be guided by considerations of duty.
('85', 447, 7, 25, 719313) Bread comes first and adornment afterwards.
('85', 447, 7, 26, 719357) That has always been my belief.
('85', 447, 7, 27, 719389) But since you are here, do whatever you conveniently can.
('85', 447, 7, 28, 719447) Learn here what true art is.
('85', 447, 7, 29, 719476) The art teacher should first take up some work which would enable him to earn his livelihood.
('85', 447, 7, 30, 719570) Later on he may paint and teach painting.
('85', 447, 7, 31, 719612) Such artists alone will teach true art.
('85', 447, 7, 32, 719652) You will remember what I had said about the broom.
('85', 447, 7, 33, 719703) Sweeping is a great art.
('85', 447, 7, 34, 719728) Where to keep the broom, how to handle it,should there be one broom or different brooms for different jobs, should one stand erect or bend while sweeping, should one raise dust or sprinkle water

('85', 448, 1, 2, 720103) before sweeping, does one sweep the corners, pay attention to the walls and the roofall these questions should occur to an artist.
('85', 448, 1, 3, 720234) Only then would he find beauty in sweeping.
('85', 448, 1, 4, 720278) There is therefore a place for a true artist in Nayee Talim.
('85', 448, 1, 5, 720339) I have already told you who is a true artist.
('85', 448, 1, 6, 720385) Nanda Babu comes very close to my ideal, though perhaps he is not the perfect ideal.
('85', 448, 1, 7, 720470) However, he is so big a man that it would be highly improper for me to say anything in criticism of him.
('85', 448, 1, 8, 720575) Read the article I wrote on my talks with Gurudev.

('85', 452, 6, 9, 725452) DEAR DR.
('85', 452, 6, 10, 725461) TARACHAND, I understand and appreciate the principle involved in No.
('85', 452, 6, 11, 725530) 7 of your scheme.
('85', 452, 6, 12, 725548) If full local autonomy is granted to Western Bengal and East Punjab as proposed in Nos.
('85', 452, 6, 13, 725636) l and 2 of your scheme, it may overcome the objections of the Muslim League and obviate the necessity of dividing Bengal or Punjab.
('85', 452, 6, 14, 725768) This part of your scheme should be treated as an essential condition and not be considered as mere detail.
('85', 452, 6, 15, 725875) I do not follow the argument in No.
('85', 452, 6, 16, 725911) 5. If, however, the people of the areas concerned are agreeable to dispense with a plebiscite, I would not insist on it.
('85', 452, 6, 17, 726032) It is a matter for consideration what, apart from a plebiscite, would be a satisfactory proof of the people being agreeable to the proposal.
('85', 452, 6, 18, 726173) I presume that the step embodied in No.
('85', 452, 6, 19, 726213) 4 will be simultaneous with and an integral part of the whole scheme.
('85', 452, 6, 20, 726283) Apart from and independent of these proposals I may add that if you can induce the League to accept the award of a board, say consisting of yourself and Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, I would accept it.
('85', 452, 6, 21, 726478) You will mark the changes I have made in your draft, which I enclose herewith.

('85', 453, 1, 2, 726628) [ENCLOSURE]
('85', 453, 2, 3, 726640) (a) that Mahatma jis terms are an acceptance of the claim for separation according to a reasonable in terpretation of the Muslim League resolution of 1940
('85', 453, 3, 4, 726795) Suggested changes shown in margin.
('85', 453, 3, 5, 726830) My interpretation of Mahatmajis letter of 24th September, 1944, to Mr. Jinnah is as follows: (a) that Mahatmaji accepts the Muslim claim for separation as contained in the Muslim League resolution of 1940. 1
('85', 453, 4, 6, 727038) (b) Mahatmaji is agreeable to the appointment of a commission consisting of representatives of the Congress and the League immediately for the delimitation of the boundaries of the separate sovereign States.
('85', 453, 4, 7, 727246) (c) Mahatmaji wants that the sovereign States will immediately enter into a treaty for the purpose of (i)safeguarding interests of minorities, (ii) establishing a machinery for the administration of subjects of common concern.
('85', 453, 4, 8, 727473) But Mahatmaji desires that the wishes of the inhabitants of the areas to be demarcated into sovereign States should be ascertained by a plebiscite.
('85', 453, 4, 9, 727621) Mahatmaji does not agree with the theory that the Hindus of the whole of India or the Muslims of the whole of India constitute two separate nations.
('85', 453, 4, 10, 727770) In my (Tarachands) opinion Mahatmaji has substantially accepted the Muslim demand and agreed to the establishment of two sovereign and independent States in India.
('85', 453, 4, 11, 727934) The differences between Mahatmaji and Mr. Jinnah are: (1) Mahatmaji wants before separation a plebiscite.
('85', 453, 4, 12, 728040) (2) He does not believe in the theory of religious or communal nationality.
('85', 453, 5, 13, 728116) 1Vide Appendix Resolution Passed by All India Muslim League, 23 3 1940.

('85', 454, 1, 2, 728231) (b) The subjects of each federation will be full nationals and no discrimina tion will be made among them in the matter of vot ing or other wise on the ground of race or creed.
('85', 454, 2, 3, 728408) (3) He desires that the machinery for administration of matters of common interest should be embodied in the treaty of separation.
('85', 454, 3, 4, 728539) I suggest that the differences between Mahatmaji and Mr. Jinnah can be eliminated provided an agreement is arrived at as follows: (1) The sovereign and independent States in the North West and East and in the rest of India should be federations.
('85', 454, 3, 5, 728785) The units of these federations will be, in the North West:
('85', 454, 4, 6, 728844) (i) Baluchistan,
('85', 454, 5, 7, 728861) (ii) North West Frontier Province,
('85', 454, 6, 8, 728896) (iii) Western and Central Punjab,
('85', 454, 7, 9, 728930) (iv) South Eastern Punjab (one or two units)
('85', 454, 8, 10, 728975) (v) Sind.
('85', 454, 8, 11, 728985) (2) These units will have certain subjects including culture, education, personal law, etc., under the control of the governments of the units.
('85', 454, 8, 12, 729129) The federal government will have the usual federal and common subjects under its control.
('85', 454, 9, 13, 729219) (3) Similarly there may be units in Bengal, if the inhabitants of Bengal so desire and the remaining India will form one federation.
('85', 454, 10, 14, 729352) (4) These two federations will by treaty establish a confederation of independent and sovereign fede rations for the administration of matters of com mon interest, e.
('85', 454, 10, 15, 729519) g., defence, customs, foreign affairs, communications.
('85', 454, 11, 16, 729574) (5) The establishment of the confederation eliminates the necessity of a plebiscite, which therefore need not be held.
('85', 454, 12, 17, 729693) (6) The subjects of each federation will be the full nationals and no discrimination will be made among them on the ground of race or creed.
('85', 454, 13, 18, 729834) (7) The establishment of federations in different regions obviates the need for any large adjustment of the present boundaries of the provinces.
('85', 454, 14, 19, 729979) (8) The provisions about the establishment of federations and confederations will be embodied in the treaty of separation.

('85', 456, 8, 19, 731897) Your way wasclear.
('85', 456, 8, 20, 731916) You should not have said anything.

('85', 456, 8, 23, 732071) Why should then there be any need for separate arrangements for the Ashram?
('85', 456, 8, 24, 732147) Everyone can feed there.
('85', 456, 8, 25, 732172) A catering service could mean that one should be served what one ordered, subject to the normal limitations of the service.
('85', 456, 8, 26, 732296) The present kitchen itself may be turned into a catering service.
('85', 456, 8, 27, 732362) That would solve the problem and save us all from bother.

('85', 456, 8, 31, 732561) Rama was not the only avatar.
('85', 456, 8, 32, 732591) Narasimha also was one, and so were the Fish and the Tortoise.
('85', 456, 8, 33, 732654) Werent the monkeys partial avatars?
('85', 456, 8, 34, 732690) The question you have raised ought not to have been raised at all.
('85', 456, 8, 35, 732757) I do not see the Ashram as a hospital.
('85', 456, 8, 36, 732796) But in any case this work serves a useful purpose.

('85', 459, 4, 5, 735827) BOMBAY VIEW, MATHERAN, October 12, 1944
('85', 459, 5, 6, 735867) RESPECTED BAPU,
('85', 459, 6, 7, 735883) Received your letter dated the 9th.
('85', 459, 7, 8, 735919) I too believe in freedom of speech.
('85', 459, 7, 9, 735955) But the question before me on the night of 1 8 39 was to quell the dreadful riot that had just begun.
('85', 459, 7, 10, 736057) It was my duty to take promptly all the measures that were imperative to bring the situation under control.
('85', 459, 7, 11, 736165) And I had (also) to see that some three or four papers that fanned the (communal) passion did not add fuel to the fire.
('85', 459, 7, 12, 736285) I did not think I was disregarding the principle of freedom of speech in keeping a check on it when it was misused.
('85', 459, 7, 13, 736401) Even today I do Dot think so.
('85', 459, 8, 14, 736431) My Jaipur speech was the result of my study of that problem.
('85', 459, 8, 15, 736492) You will not find any contradiction in it if I put it (before you) point by point.
('85', 459, 9, 16, 736575) (1) Sanskrit is our most valuable treasure.
('85', 459, 9, 17, 736619) With its help alone we can make our languages as powerful as English and French.
('85', 459, 10, 18, 736700) (2) The power of our language which can express thought and creative endeavour belongs in general to the Sanskrit element.
('85', 459, 10, 19, 736823) And so, if we are going to evolve in India a medium for expressing our thoughts and literature there is no alternative except resorting to the use of Sanskrit words.
('85', 459, 10, 20, 736989) Today I have before me the problem of the technical terms for law, philosophy and psychology.
('85', 459, 10, 21, 737083) Where can we have the Indian medium except from Sanskrit?
('85', 459, 10, 22, 737141) I do not think I have drifted away from your stand at Nagpur (and) Indore and which I had accepted.
('85', 459, 11, 23, 737241) (3) I do not also see any opposition to the Congress policy in my address.
('85', 459, 11, 24, 737316) As I have understood, the Congress aims to make the colloquial Hindustani a common medium for the whole country.
('85', 459, 11, 25, 737429) But how can the colloquial Hindustani be the medium of thought or literature?
('85', 459, 11, 26, 737507) The moment it attempts to be (any) such thing, it has got to seek the help of Sanskrit or Perso Arabic words.
('85', 459, 11, 27, 737617) I cannot speak in that language unless I use Sanskrit words.
('85', 459, 11, 28, 737678) There is no intentional Sanskritization; nothing else is possible.
('85', 459, 12, 29, 737745) (4) If Hindustani is to be the medium in the legislatures or the colleges, there are bound to be two forms of the language: one will be Sanskritized (and) the other Persianized.

('85', 460, 1, 2, 738043) (5) One reason why you have not liked my address may be that in one paragraph the experiment of the Hindustani Samiti (carried on) under your guidance is criticized.
('85', 460, 1, 3, 738209) What the Samiti is attempting to do is not the propagation of colloquial Hindustani but evolving a new style.
('85', 460, 1, 4, 738319) Among its characteristics are: (1) abandoning the tatsama forms of Sanskrit words, (2) incorporating the tatsama forms of Persian words, (3) introducing an Arabic or a Persian word in the form of an Urdu word even if a tatsama Sanskrit word has been traditionally accepted, (4) giving preference to Persian words in cases where both Sanskrit and Persian words are current.

('85', 460, 7, 10, 738777) SEVAGRAM,
('85', 460, 8, 11, 738787) October 29, 1944
('85', 460, 9, 12, 738804) Talks about the possibility of Gandhiji going on a fast have upset many friends and co workers.
('85', 460, 9, 13, 738900) Their love for him makes them shudder at the very thought of his undergoing the ordeal of another fast at his age and in his present state of health.
('85', 460, 9, 14, 739050) Although he is keeping fairly fit and is putting in a full days work his reserve of energy is low.
('85', 460, 9, 15, 739149) He is still slightly anaemic and the two intestinal parasites, hook worm and amoebae, which are lying latent at present, can get the upper hand at any moment if his general condition is run down.
('85', 460, 9, 16, 739345) Moreover, they feel that a fast on his part at this stage will add to the general demoralization and increase the popular bitterness against the Government.
('85', 460, 10, 17, 739502) Gandhiji is not perturbed by considerations of his age or his frailness.
('85', 460, 10, 18, 739575) His stand has always been that if God wants to take work from him He will spare him.
('85', 460, 10, 19, 739660) If his work is over, there is no point in prolonging his sojourn in this world.
('85', 460, 10, 20, 739740) However, friends have a right to feel that it is not wise to tempt Providence too often.
('85', 460, 11, 21, 739829) As for the risk of increase of demoralization and bitterness as a result of the fast, he does not think it likely.
('85', 460, 11, 22, 739944) A purely non violent act cannot result in such a thing.
('85', 460, 11, 23, 740000) Asked as to why he thinks he may have to fast, he said that ever since his release from prison he had an instinctive feeling that another fast lay in store for him.
('85', 460, 11, 24, 740165) Of late that feeling had taken a more concrete form.
('85', 460, 11, 25, 740218) The organized violence and slaughter of Truth all over has oppressed him deeply.
('85', 460, 11, 26, 740299) To take a few illustrations, the cause of millions dying of starvation according to him is not altogether scarcity of food.
('85', 460, 11, 27, 740423) Food is allowed to rot in godowns while people die for the want of it.
('85', 460, 11, 28, 740494) It is a sad

('85', 461, 1, 2, 740595) tale of mismanagement and corruption.
('85', 461, 1, 3, 740633) Those who grow food have to go without it.
('85', 461, 1, 4, 740676) The Government officials, instead of being their protectors, are acting as their exploiters.
('85', 461, 1, 5, 740769) And it is not the Government officials alone who are to blame.
('85', 461, 1, 6, 740832) Our own people, middlemen, petty traders and big merchants have not hesitated to make money at the cost of human life.
('85', 461, 1, 7, 740951) It is a tragedy.
('85', 461, 1, 8, 740968) Unofficial and official exploitation go on side by side.
('85', 461, 1, 9, 741025) Without the former, the latter can have no locus standi.
('85', 461, 1, 10, 741082) From top to bottom the whole system is corrupt.
('85', 461, 1, 11, 741130) The Government connives at unofficial corruption.
('85', 461, 1, 12, 741180) That is the way in which violence works.
('85', 461, 1, 13, 741221) It organizes all the forces of evil.
('85', 461, 1, 14, 741258) As against this non violence must act by organizing all the forces of goodness.
('85', 461, 1, 15, 741338) If the nation had the control of the Government, this terrible bribery and corruption, which might if at all find its parallel in the bribery and corruption of Lord Clives days, would not take place.
('85', 461, 1, 16, 741538) A national government having the confidence of the people can very largely mitigate their sufferings.
('85', 461, 1, 17, 741640) But there seems to be no chance of it.
('85', 461, 1, 18, 741679) He described to what lengths he had gone to woo the Viceroy.
('85', 461, 1, 19, 741740) But the Government were blinded by the intoxication of power.
('85', 461, 1, 20, 741802) The vision of victory, which would be no victory but merely preparation for another war, had made them indifferent.
('85', 461, 1, 21, 741918) How was he to demonstrate the efficacy of non violence under the circumstances?
('85', 461, 1, 22, 741998) How could he relieve the sufferings of the dumb millions?
('85', 461, 1, 23, 742056) By conducting a mass movement?
('85', 461, 1, 24, 742087) He had already showed why it was not to be thought of.
('85', 461, 1, 25, 742142) He could not lead or bless a mass civil disobedience movement today.
('85', 461, 1, 26, 742211) Then what could he do?
('85', 461, 1, 27, 742234) He had claimed that non violence was always more than a match for violence however well organized.
('85', 461, 1, 28, 742333) How could he make that claim good?
('85', 461, 1, 29, 742368) At the beginning of the War, English friends had written to him asking how individual pacifists could fight spreading wave of violence and bloodshed.
('85', 461, 1, 30, 742518) He had suggested fasting as one of the remedies.
('85', 461, 1, 31, 742567) Some of them had laughed at the suggestion, but he stuck to it.
('85', 461, 1, 32, 742631) A time might come for him to test that remedy in his own case.
('85', 461, 1, 33, 742694) That was perhaps the only way to wake up the conscience of mankind.
('85', 461, 2, 34, 742762) Untouchability was another manifestation of violence.
('85', 461, 2, 35, 742816) He had repeated it from house tops that if untouchability lived Hinduism must perish.
('85', 461, 2, 36, 742902) The two could not go on side by side.
('85', 461, 2, 37, 742940) Though much progress was made why did it still persist?
('85', 461, 3, 38, 742996) there was the question of communal disharmony.
('85', 461, 3, 39, 743043) It was also a manifestation of violence.
('85', 461, 3, 40, 743084) He had striven against it from his early youth.
('85', 461, 4, 41, 743132) Why did his non violence appear to be impotent in the face of these various manifestations of untruth and violence?
('85', 461, 4, 42, 743248) Was he an unworthy exponent of non violence?
('85', 461, 4, 43, 743293) Should he not again crucify the flesh in order to become a better instrument?
('85', 461, 4, 44, 743371) Knowing the remedy, how could he evade it?
('85', 461, 4, 45, 743414) That the fast might fail to bring about the desired result or might end in death should not be a deterrent.
('85', 461, 5, 46, 743522) Asked about the nature of the fast, he said he did not know it himself.
('85', 461, 5, 47, 743594) He was still groping.
('85', 461, 5, 48, 743616) He was not aware as to when it would come, if at all.
('85', 461, 5, 49, 743670) All he could say was that the call was insistent.
('85', 461, 5, 50, 743720) If the fast did come, he hoped that the people would not become panicky or grief stricken.
('85', 461, 5, 51, 743811) He expected them to co operate with him in clearing the air of
('85', 462, 0, 1, 743874) VOL.85 : 2 OCTOBER, 1944 3 MARCH, 1945 463
('85', 462, 1, 2, 743917) violence in every shape or form.
('85', 462, 1, 3, 743950) That was the best way of ending the fast and even of preventing it.

('85', 462, 4, 8, 744115) Personal October 25, 1944
('85', 462, 5, 9, 744141) MY DEAR GANDHIJI, I have just read in The Hindustan Times of the 24th of October your statement issued after the enquiry made by Mr. Horniman as to whether you are contemplating another fast to achieve communal unity.
('85', 462, 5, 10, 744359) I know I have no place as an adviser in these matters and I am most reluctant to offer advice to anyone in regard to any matter which is based on spiritual considerations.
('85', 462, 5, 11, 744531) I am approaching the whole thing from a secular point of view.
('85', 462, 5, 12, 744594) I think it would be a great mistake to undertake a fast at this time of your life.
('85', 462, 5, 13, 744677) The consequences might be disastrous.
('85', 462, 5, 14, 744715) I do not think that your fast will be helpful in the solution of the communal problem.
('85', 462, 5, 15, 744802) You may undertake a fast by way of penance, purification or protest, but the real question is as to what effect it is going to produce on the minds of those without whose agreement there can be no communal settlement.
('85', 462, 5, 16, 745020) I do not think those who are taking a different view will be at all influenced by your fast.
('85', 462, 5, 17, 745113) Indeed some of them may uncharitably suggest that you are putting undue pressure on them.
('85', 462, 5, 18, 745203) Personally speaking I think that it is very necessary that you must continue to live.
('85', 462, 5, 19, 745289) Your failure on the last occasion does not mean that you will always fail.
('85', 462, 5, 20, 745364) Your motives are pure and I think your approach to the whole question is sound, if I may respectfully say so.
('85', 462, 5, 21, 745474) What you have not been able to achieve so far, God willing, you may achieve it a few months later.
('85', 462, 5, 22, 745573) I consider it my duty to write to you as plainly as I possibly can against the step which is said to be within your contemplation.
('85', 462, 5, 23, 745704) You will forgive me if I have encroached upon your time .

('85', 463, 6, 7, 746099) MY DEAR MAHATMAJI,
('85', 463, 7, 8, 746118) Your two letters of the 1st and the 3rd of November were handed over to me yesterday at the Wardha station by Devdas.
('85', 463, 7, 9, 746236) I also received your letter through Dr. Beni Prasad.
('85', 463, 8, 10, 746289) I have not issued any statement about an All Parties Conference but have written to certain friends and am awaiting their replies.
('85', 463, 8, 11, 746420) The idea seems to me to be vague and indefinite.
('85', 463, 8, 12, 746469) We must decide as to who are the persons to be invited and what will be the agenda.
('85', 463, 8, 13, 746553) It is quite clear that the gentlemen whom we invite will not come there in their representative capacity.
('85', 463, 8, 14, 746659) Your presence at the Conference will be a source of great strength and you can certainly make a statement telling us in plain language as to what led to the breakdown of the conversations at Bombay.
('85', 463, 8, 15, 746858) You say the Conference may meet to consider the causes of the failure of the talks and to find whose fault it was which led to the breakdown.
('85', 463, 8, 16, 747000) I should not advise that Conference to find whose fault it was, because once we do it will lead to interminable controversy.
('85', 463, 8, 17, 747125) If we call such a Conference and hear you I think we may consider what further steps it is necessary to take to solve the problem.
('85', 463, 8, 18, 747256) From this point of view the proposed conference will be an exploratory one and may thus inform and educate public opinion.
('85', 463, 9, 19, 747379) I am very anxious that you should on no account undertake a fast.
('85', 463, 9, 20, 747445) I know how deeply spiritual you are and I also know that in your case the call of religion means much more than in the case of 99 out of a hundred.
('85', 463, 9, 21, 747593) You will pardon me if I take a matter of fact and practical view of the thing.
('85', 463, 9, 22, 747672) I am definitely certain that although it may bring solace to your heart and you may feel that you have done the penance for what you consider to be the evils of the present day, your fast will not melt the heart of your opponents.
('85', 463, 9, 23, 747903) On the contrary I feel some of them may be uncharitable enough to attribute to you unworthy motives.
('85', 463, 9, 24, 748004) Never before in our history was it more necessary than now that you should live to guide the people of this country on tile true path of nationalism.
('85', 463, 9, 25, 748154) My own conviction is and has been for years that irrespective of what the British Government may or may not do this monster of communalism should be killed.
('85', 463, 9, 26, 748311) Whatever your critics may say I honestly believe that you are the one man in the country who does not think on communal lines and it would be a disaster for the country if it was deprived at this juncture of your guidance.

('85', 464, 1, 2, 748618) You are the one man who can withstand opposition, ridicule and even the attribution of unworthy motives to you.
('85', 464, 1, 3, 748730) Above all you have the courage to take the right line.
('85', 464, 1, 4, 748785) I am saying that in absolute sincerity even though I differ from you and have differed from you in regard to civil disobedience.
('85', 464, 2, 5, 748914) I have told Devdas that according to my information some changes in high quarters may be expected, but whether that information is true or not, the existing situation cannot last very long and when the time comes for practical steps to be taken towards the settlement of national differences I believe your voice will be the determining factor.
('85', 464, 2, 6, 749259) I do not want that voice to be silenced.
('85', 464, 2, 7, 749300) I am, therefore, appealing to you with all the earnestness I am capable of not to undertake such a fast.
('85', 464, 3, 8, 749405) As regards my coming to Wardha if I can get away on the evening of the 7th or the 8th and arrangements can be made for reservations from Wardha to Itarsi and from Itarsi to Allahabad I should in response to your message like to break journey at Wardha for a few hours.

('85', 466, 2, 3, 752115) LETTER FROM DURLAB SINGH 1
('85', 466, 3, 4, 752142) LAHORE, November 12, 1944
('85', 466, 4, 5, 752168) RESPECTED BAPUJI,
('85', 466, 5, 6, 752186) The Congress had promised in its Lahore Resolution of 1929 that no constitution would be acceptable to the Congress which does not give the fullest satisfaction to the Sikhs.
('85', 466, 5, 7, 752361) You know a large number of Sikhs are perturbed over Rajajis proposals.
('85', 466, 5, 8, 752432) Supposing Mr. Jinnah had accepted the proposals in full, or in an amended form, what would have been the position of the Sikhs in that?
('85', 466, 6, 9, 752568) Even the Akalis feel very indignant because you did not touch the question of meeting a Sikh deputation as suggested by Master Tara Singh in his letter.
('85', 466, 6, 10, 752721) Can you please make it clear why it was not considered desirable to invite the Sikh leaders before proceeding to Mr. Jinnah for the talks?
('85', 466, 7, 11, 752860) Mr. Jagat Narain Lals Resolution clearly states that the Congress would be no party to the vivisection of the country.
('85', 466, 7, 12, 752979) Is it not a fact that Rajajis proposals run counter to that resolution?
('85', 466, 7, 13, 753051) The Sikh public is made to believe that Gandhiji does not favour the idea of the Sikhs remaining in the Congress because of their belief in the sword.
('85', 466, 8, 14, 753202) Master Tara Singh and other responsible Akali leaders have often declared in the Press and on the platform that the Sikander Baldev Singh Pact was enacted with the consent and blessings of the Congress High Command and Sardar Patels special representative who was present in the Punjab throughout the negotiations and that the Sardar was kept informed of all the developments.
('85', 466, 8, 15, 753579) Further, it is said that the Azad Punjab scheme was introduced with your consent and blessings.
('85', 466, 8, 16, 753675) The nationalist Sikhs regard both the schemes as anti national and opposed to the interests of the country and the community.
('85', 466, 8, 17, 753801) Can you kindly guide us in the matter?
('85', 466, 9, 18, 753840) In the end I will request you, Bapuji, to give a general assurance to the nationalist Sikhs that their interests are safe in your hands and that they will not be sacrificed at any cost.
('85', 466, 9, 19, 754026) The heart of the Sikh masses is with the Congress and nationalism and patriotism are their proud heritage.
('85', 466, 9, 20, 754133) They cannot depart from these principles, but let them have this satisfaction at least that the Congress will do no injustice to them and .
('85', 466, 9, 21, 754273) that they will have their proper place in free India.
('85', 466, 10, 22, 754327) Praying for your long life, Yours sincerely, DURLAB SINGH

('85', 467, 2, 3, 754528) RESOLUTION PASSED BY A.I.S.A. 1
('85', 467, 3, 4, 754560) [On or before December 3, 1944]
('85', 467, 4, 5, 754592) A meeting of the Board of Trustees of the Charkha Sangh was held at Sevagram on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd December 1944, under the presidentship of Shree Gandhiji and the following decisions were taken:
('85', 467, 5, 6, 754790) The roots of the spinning wheel lie in the villages and the consummation of the ideal of the Charkha Sangh is to be completely decentralized among the villages of India to bring about an all round improvement of village life.
('85', 467, 5, 7, 755016) This meeting of the Board of Trustees of the Charkha Sangh therefore resolves that with a view to this end the following changes should be made in the policy of the Sangh:
('85', 467, 6, 8, 755188) (i) As many qualified workers as are ready and are selected by the Board should be sent to work in the villages.
('85', 467, 7, 9, 755301) (ii) The activities of the existing sale depots and production centres of khadi should be curtailed.
('85', 467, 8, 10, 755402) (iii) Necessary changes should be made in the curricula of the existing khadi training centres and their scope broadened.
('85', 467, 8, 11, 755524) New training centres should also be opened.
('85', 467, 9, 12, 755568) (iv) If in any area (not bigger than a district) the workers ask to be made self sufficient and autonomous in order to begin work on the new lines laid down by the Charkha Sangh the Sangh should, if it approves of their plans, withdraw from that area but continue to give its recognition and moral support so long as the work is carried on according to its policy.
('85', 467, 10, 13, 755933) (v) A Joint Board of the nominees of the Charkha Sangh, Gram Udyog Sangh, Harijan Sevak Sangh and Goseva Sangh should be constituted to meet from time to time and issue instructions in terms of the new policy.
('85', 467, 11, 14, 756143) The Sangh shall be represented in the Joint Board by its President, its Secretary and Shri Dhirendra Majmudar, while the other four Sanghs shall have two nominees each besides Gandhiji.

('85', 468, 1, 2, 756432) GUIDELINES FOR PROPOSED INTERIM GOVERNMENT 1
('85', 468, 2, 3, 756477) January 5, 1945
('85', 468, 3, 4, 756493) The following were the various steps proposed to be taken in this behalf as they emerged from their discussion and the elucidations provided by Gandhiji from time to time:
('85', 468, 4, 5, 756665) 1. The Congress and the League would agree that they would join in forming an Interim Government in the Centre (a) consisting of equal numbers of persons nominated by the Congress and the League in the Central Legislature, (b) representatives of minorities, and (c) the Commander in Chief.
('85', 468, 5, 6, 756955) 2. While the Government would be formed and would function within the framework of the existing Government of India Act, it would be clearly understood between the Congress and the League that any measure not passed by the House should not be enforced or sought to be enforced by any of the powers of the Governor General under the Constitution.
('85', 468, 5, 7, 757301) This would serve to eliminate in action the veto of the Governor General and make the nominees responsible to the elected Legislature.
('85', 468, 6, 8, 757436) 3. The European member, if one had to be included, should be the choice of the Congress and the League.
('85', 468, 7, 9, 757540) 4. It should be agreed between the Congress and the League in advance that if such Interim Government was formed their first step would be to release the members of the Working Committee.
('85', 468, 7, 10, 757728) A firm and clear commitment of the League in regard to this would be a preliminary proof of its bona fides.
('85', 468, 8, 11, 757836) 5. Bhulabhai must make sure before committing himself to anything that the agreement he had in view had the previous approval of Jinnah and the whole thing should be clarified and reduced to writing so as not to lead to any ambiguity or misunderstanding afterwards.
('85', 468, 9, 12, 758102) 6. If such a Government was formed at the Centre, the next step would be to get the withdrawal of Governors rule in the Provinces and to form, as soon as possible, Provincial Governments on the lines of a coalition.
('85', 468, 10, 13, 758318) 7. At the proper moment Gandhiji would tell the Working Committee that Bhulabhai had acted with his approval.

('85', 469, 4, 5, 758612) February 1,1945
('85', 469, 5, 6, 758628) DEAR GANDHIJI, My last letter to you was dated 28th September, 1944. You had promised in an earlier letter that you will refer the question of our moral bona fides and your what I may call anti Communist file to your worthy colleagues.
('85', 469, 5, 7, 758864) I hope they have reached their conclusions and reported to you.
('85', 469, 5, 8, 758928) But I have not heard anything from you yet.
('85', 469, 5, 9, 758972) You perhaps do not know that your name is being used against us in the recent Congressmens Conferences and even otherwise by persons who pretend to know your mind, etc.
('85', 469, 5, 10, 759141) I know that most of what they attribute to you could never have been said by you.
('85', 469, 5, 11, 759223) But my own lips are sealed till my correspondence with you is concluded over the questions you asked me and they were very serious questions, doubting our elementary patriotic and moral bona fides.
('85', 469, 5, 12, 759421) I hope with the help of your Working Committee colleagues you have reached the conclusion that we are not unworthy children of our great people.
('85', 469, 5, 13, 759566) Great things are happening in the world but our country is going to pieces.
('85', 469, 5, 14, 759642) We are anxious to write to you on the big political issues but as I wrote to you before it will be waste of your time and mine till you are convinced about our intellectual honesty and moral integrity.
('85', 469, 5, 15, 759844) I understand from Dr. Mahmud that you think that you are the aggrieved party.
('85', 469, 5, 16, 759922) This is exactly the opposite of what we feel.
('85', 469, 5, 17, 759968) I of course, meant no offence but only expressed my indignation at my Party being slandered and offered to go into the dock straightaway.
('85', 469, 5, 18, 760106) I do not know what else I could do.
('85', 469, 5, 19, 760142) Bhulabhai and Mrs. Naidu had promised to speed up the matter but I have not heard from them at all.
('85', 469, 5, 20, 760242) Rajaji told me that he had already told you all that he had to.
('85', 469, 5, 21, 760306) May I request you for an answer as soon as you can and to get your colleagues speed up their report to you.
('85', 469, 5, 22, 760414) I could send Mohan to pick up the answer and answer any further questions he feels himself qualified to tackle.
('85', 469, 5, 23, 760526) I am going to Bengal for three weeks today.
('85', 469, 5, 24, 760570) Could your answer be ready by the time I am back?
('85', 469, 5, 25, 760620) Mohan will be very busy in my absenceand will find it very difficult to come there in February unless you specially want him to; but any date after 7 March will be best.
('85', 469, 6, 26, 760790) With respectful salutations, Yours sincerely,

('85', 470, 4, 6, 761091) I have been reading the news about your health in the newspapers.
('85', 470, 4, 7, 761157) I have now much pleasure in sending you herewith a copy of the questionnaire framed by the committee of which I am the Chairman.
('85', 470, 4, 8, 761286) I dare say your attention has already been called to it.
('85', 470, 4, 9, 761343) I shall be extremely grateful to you if you will favour the committee with a short memorandum stating your views generally and answering the questions or such of them as you prefer to answer.
('85', 470, 4, 10, 761535) So far there has been a good response to the committee excepting in certain quarters.
('85', 470, 4, 11, 761621) Mr. Jinnah has declined to recognize the committee or to meet me as Chairman of the committee though he has no objection to meeting me in my individual capacity.
('85', 470, 4, 12, 761783) Dr. Ambedkar promised support when we first met in November last at Delhi but has withdrawn it because he has objection to the personnel of the committee.
('85', 470, 4, 13, 761938) The attitude of the Sikhs has been very encouraging so far.
('85', 470, 4, 14, 761998) I am going on the 16th of January to Lahore to see the Sikh and Hindu leaders and shall try also to meet such Muslim leaders as have no objection to meeting me.
('85', 470, 4, 15, 762159) The work of the committee is being done at great pressure.
('85', 470, 4, 16, 762218) We have already collected much material and more will be ready soon.
('85', 470, 4, 17, 762287) I do not wish to trouble you with details but I shall be extremely grateful if you will favour me with a short memorandum.
('85', 470, 4, 18, 762410) I am also sending you separately the two pamphlets already brought out, others are in the course of being printed.
('85', 470, 5, 19, 762525) With kindest regards and best wishes for your early recovery,
