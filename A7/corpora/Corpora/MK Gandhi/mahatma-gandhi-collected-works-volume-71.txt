('71', 0, 2, 3, 61) [February 25, 1937] 2
('71', 0, 3, 4, 83) GANDHIJI: I shall certainly give you my reaction to Christianity.
('71', 0, 3, 5, 149) Even when I was 18 I came in touch with good Christians in London.
('71', 0, 3, 6, 216) Before that I had come in touch with what I used then to call beef and beer bottle Christianity, for these were regarded as the indispensable criteria of a man becoming a Christian, with also a third thing, namely, adoption of a European style of dress.
('71', 0, 3, 7, 470) Those Christians were parodying St. Pauls teachingCall thou nothing unclean.
('71', 0, 3, 8, 547) I went to London, therefore, with that prejudice against Christianity.
('71', 0, 3, 9, 618) I came across good Christians there who placed the Bible in my hands.
('71', 0, 3, 10, 688) Then I met numerous Christians in South Africa, and I have since grown to this belief that Christianity is as good and as true a religion as my own.
('71', 0, 3, 11, 837) For a time I struggled with the question, which was the true religion out of those I know?
('71', 0, 3, 12, 928) But ultimately I came to the deliberate conviction that there was no such thing as only one true religion, every other being false.
('71', 0, 3, 13, 1060) There is no religion that is absolutely perfect.
('71', 0, 3, 14, 1109) All are equally imperfect or more or less perfect, hence the conclusion that Christianity is as good and true as my own religion.
('71', 0, 3, 15, 1239) But so also about Islam or Zoroastrianism or Judaism.
('71', 0, 3, 16, 1293) I therefore do not take as literally true the text 3 that Jesus is the only begotten Son of God.
('71', 0, 3, 17, 1390) God cannot be the exclusive father and I cannot ascribe exclusive divinity to Jesus.
('71', 0, 3, 18, 1475) He is as divine as Krishna or Rama or Mahomed or Zoroaster.
('71', 0, 3, 19, 1535) Similarly I do not regard every word of the Bible as the inspired word of God even as I do not regard every word of the Vedas or the Koran as inspired.
('71', 0, 3, 20, 1687) The sum total of each of these books is certainly inspired, but I miss that inspiration in many of the things taken individually.
('71', 0, 3, 21, 1817) The Bible is as much a book of religion with me as the Gita and the Koran.
('71', 0, 3, 22, 1892) Therefore I am not interested in weaning you from Christianity and making you a Hindu, and I would not relish your designs upon
('71', 0, 4, 23, 2020) 1 Extracted from Mahadev Desais Weekly Letter.
('71', 0, 4, 24, 2067) Dr. Crane was a clergyman from America, who had given up active service in the midst of World War I in disgust for its violence.
('71', 0, 4, 25, 2196) He wanted to know Gandhijis attitude towards Christianity and also religion in general.

('71', 1, 0, 1, 2349) 2 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 1, 1, 2, 2389) me, if you had any, to convert me to Christianity!
('71', 1, 1, 3, 2440) I would also dispute your claim that Christianity is the only true religion.
('71', 1, 1, 4, 2517) It is also a true religion, a noble religion, and along with other religions it has contributed to raise the moral height of mankind.
('71', 1, 1, 5, 2651) But it has yet to make a greater contribution.
('71', 1, 1, 6, 2698) After all what are 2,000 years in the life of a religion?
('71', 1, 1, 7, 2756) Just now Christianity comes to yearning mankind in a tainted form.
('71', 1, 1, 8, 2823) Fancy Bishops supporting slaughter in the name of Christianity.
('71', 1, 2, 9, 2887) CRANE: But, when you say that all religions are true, what do you do when there are conflicting counsels?
('71', 1, 3, 10, 2993) G. I have no difficulty in hitting upon the truth, because I go by certain fundamental maxims.
('71', 1, 3, 11, 3088) Truth is superior to everything and I reject what conflicts with it.
('71', 1, 3, 12, 3157) Similarly that which is in conflict with non violence should be rejected.
('71', 1, 3, 13, 3231) And on matters which can be reasoned out, that which conflicts with Reason must also be rejected.
('71', 1, 4, 14, 3329) C. In matters which can be reasoned out?
('71', 1, 5, 15, 3370) G. Yes, there are subjects where Reason cannot take us far and we have to accept things on faith.
('71', 1, 5, 16, 3468) Faith then does not contradict Reason but transcends it.
('71', 1, 5, 17, 3525) Faith is a kind of sixth sense which works in cases which are without the purview of Reason.
('71', 1, 5, 18, 3618) Well then, given these three criteria, I can have no difficulty in examining all claims made on behalf of religion.
('71', 1, 5, 19, 3734) Thus to believe that Jesus is the only begotten son of God is to me against Reason, for God cant marry and beget children.
('71', 1, 5, 20, 3857) The word son there can only be used in a figurative sense.
('71', 1, 5, 21, 3916) In that sense everyone who stands in the position of Jesus is a begotten son of God.
('71', 1, 5, 22, 4001) If a man is spiritually miles ahead of us we may say that he is in a special sense the son of God, though we are all children of God.
('71', 1, 5, 23, 4135) We repudiate the relationship in our lives, whereas his life is a witness to that relationship.
('71', 1, 6, 24, 4231) C. Then you will recognize degrees of divinity.
('71', 1, 6, 25, 4279) Would you not say that Jesus was the most divine?
('71', 1, 6, 26, 4329) G. No, for the simple reason that we have no data.
('71', 1, 6, 27, 4380) Historically we have more data about Mahomed than anyone else because he was more recent in time.
('71', 1, 6, 28, 4478) For Jesus there are less data and still less for Buddha, Rama and Krishna; and when we know so little about them, is it not preposterous to say that one of them was more divine thananother?
('71', 1, 6, 29, 4668) In fact even if there were a great deal of data available, no judge should shoulder the burden of sifting all the evidence, if only for the reason that it requires a highly spiritual person to guage
('71', 2, 0, 1, 4867) VOL.71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 3
('71', 2, 1, 2, 4908) the degree of divinity, of the subjects he examines.
('71', 2, 1, 3, 4961) To say that Jesus was 99 per cent divine, and Mahomed 50 per cent, and Krishna 10 per cent, is to arrogate to oneself a function which really does not belong to man.
('71', 2, 2, 4, 5127) C. But, let us take a debatable point.
('71', 2, 2, 5, 5166) Supposing I was debating between whether violence is justified or not.
('71', 2, 2, 6, 5237) Mahomedanism would say one thing, Christianity another.
('71', 2, 3, 7, 5293) G. Then I must decide with the help of the tests I have suggested.
('71', 2, 4, 8, 5360) C. But does not Mahomed prescribe the use of the sword in certain circumstances?
('71', 2, 4, 9, 5441) G. I suppose most Muslims will agree.
('71', 2, 4, 10, 5479) But I read religion in a different way.
('71', 2, 4, 11, 5519) Khan Saheb Abdul Ghaffar Khan derives his belief in non violence from the Koran, and the Bishop of London derives his belief in violence from the Bible.
('71', 2, 4, 12, 5672) I derive my belief in non violence from the Gita, Whereas there are others who read violence in it.
('71', 2, 4, 13, 5772) But if the worst came of the worst and if I came to the conclusion that the Koran teaches violence, I would still reject violence, but I would not therefore say that the Bible is superior to the Koran or that Mahomed is inferior to Jesus.
('71', 2, 4, 14, 6011) It is not my function to judge Mahomed and Jesus.
('71', 2, 4, 15, 6061) It is enough that my non violence is independent of the sanction of scriptures.
('71', 2, 4, 16, 6141) But the fact remains that religious books have a hold upon mankind which other books have not.
('71', 2, 4, 17, 6236) They have made a greater impression on me than Mark Twain or, to take a more appropriate instance, Emerson.
('71', 2, 4, 18, 6344) Emerson was a thinker.
('71', 2, 4, 19, 6367) Jesus and Mahomed were through and through men of action in a sense Emerson would never be.
('71', 2, 4, 20, 6459) Their power was derived from their faith in God.
('71', 2, 5, 21, 6508) C. I will take a concrete instance now to show what I mean.
('71', 2, 5, 22, 6568) I was terribly shocked on Monday.
('71', 2, 5, 23, 6602) I counted 37 cows slain on the streets by Muslims in the name of religion, and in offence to the Hindu sentiment.
('71', 2, 5, 24, 6716) I asked the Hindu friend who travelled with me why the Muslims did so.
('71', 2, 5, 25, 6787) He said it was part of their religion.
('71', 2, 5, 26, 6826) Is it part of their spiritual growth? I asked him.
('71', 2, 5, 27, 6877) He said it was.
('71', 2, 5, 28, 6893) I met a Mussalman who said, We both please God and ourselves.
('71', 2, 5, 29, 6955) Now here was a Mussalman revelling in a thing that outrages you and me too.
('71', 2, 5, 30, 7031) Do you think all this is counter to the Koran?
('71', 2, 5, 31, 7078) G. I do indeed 1. Just as many Hindu practices, e.g., untouchabilityare no part of Hindu religion, I say that cow slaughter is no part of Islam.
('71', 2, 5, 32, 7223) But I do not wrestle with the Muslims who believe that it is part of Islam.
('71', 2, 6, 33, 7299) 1 Here Gandhiji referred the interviewer to the article Need for Tolerance, 13 3 1937
('71', 3, 0, 1, 7385) 4 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 3, 1, 2, 7425) C. What do you say to the attempts to convert?
('71', 3, 2, 3, 7472) G. I strongly resent these overtures to utterly ignorant men.
('71', 3, 2, 4, 7534) I can perhaps understand overtures made to me, as indeed they are being made.
('71', 3, 2, 5, 7612) For they can reason with me and I can reason with them.
('71', 3, 2, 6, 7668) But I certainly resent the overtures made to Harijans.
('71', 3, 2, 7, 7723) When a Christian preacher goes and says to a Harijan that Jesus was the only begotten son of God, he will give him a blank stare.
('71', 3, 2, 8, 7853) Then he holds out all kinds of inducements which debase Christianity.
('71', 3, 3, 9, 7923) C. Would you say a Harijan is not capable of reason?
('71', 3, 4, 10, 7976) G. He is.
('71', 3, 4, 11, 7986) For instance, if you try to take work out of him without payment, he will not give it.
('71', 3, 4, 12, 8073) He also has a sense of ethical values.
('71', 3, 4, 13, 8112) But when you ask him to understand theological beliefs and categories he will not understand anything.
('71', 3, 4, 14, 8215) I could not do so even when I was 17 and had a fair share of education and training.
('71', 3, 4, 15, 8300) The orthodox Hindus have so horribly neglected the Harijan that it is astonishing how he adheres to the Hindu faith.
('71', 3, 4, 16, 8417) Now I say it is outrageous for others to shake his faith.
('71', 3, 5, 17, 8475) C. What about a man who says he is commanded by God to do violence?
('71', 3, 6, 18, 8543) G. There you would not put another God before him.
('71', 3, 6, 19, 8594) You need not disturb his religion, but you will disturb his reason.
('71', 3, 7, 20, 8662) C. But take Hitler.
('71', 3, 7, 21, 8682) He says he is carrying out Gods behest in persecuting the Jews and killing his opponents.
('71', 3, 8, 22, 8772) G. You will not pit one word of God against another word of God.
('71', 3, 8, 23, 8837) But you will have to bear down his reason.
('71', 3, 8, 24, 8880) For him you will have to produce a miracle which you will do when Christians will learn the art of dying without killing in defence of what they hold dearer then religion.
('71', 3, 8, 25, 9052) But we can go on arguing like this endlessly.
('71', 3, 8, 26, 9098) And then I may tell you that you are talking against time.
('71', 3, 9, 27, 9157) And with this Gandhiji looked at the watch.
('71', 3, 10, 28, 9201) C. Just one question, then.
('71', 3, 10, 29, 9229) Would you say then that your religion is a synthesis of all religions?
('71', 3, 11, 30, 9300) G. Yes, if you will.
('71', 3, 11, 31, 9321) But I would call that synthesis Hinduism, and for you the synthesis will be Christianity.
('71', 3, 11, 32, 9411) If I did not do so, you would always be patronizing me, as many Christians do now, saying, How nice it would be if Gandhi accepted Christianity, and Muslims would be doing the same, saying, How nice it would be if Gandhi accepted Islam! That immediately puts a barrier between you and me.
('71', 3, 11, 33, 9700) Do you see that?
('71', 4, 0, 1, 9717) VOL.71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 5
('71', 4, 1, 2, 9758) C. I do.
('71', 4, 1, 3, 9767) Just one last question.
('71', 4, 1, 4, 9791) In your Hinduism do you basically include the caste system?
('71', 4, 2, 5, 9851) G. I do not.
('71', 4, 2, 6, 9864) Hinduism does not believe in caste.
('71', 4, 2, 7, 9900) I would obliterate it at once.
('71', 4, 2, 8, 9931) But I believe in varnadharma, which is the law of life.
('71', 4, 2, 9, 9987) I believe that some people are born to teach and some to defend and some to engage in trade and agriculture and some to do manual labour, so much so that these occupations become hereditary.
('71', 4, 2, 10, 10178) The law of varna is nothing but the law of conservation of energy.
('71', 4, 2, 11, 10245) Why should my son not be a scavengar if I am one?
('71', 4, 3, 12, 10295) C. Indeed?
('71', 4, 3, 13, 10306) Do you go so far?
('71', 4, 3, 14, 10324) G. I do, because I hold a scavengers profession in no way inferior to a clergymans.
('71', 4, 4, 15, 10408) C. I grant that, but should Lincoln have been a wood chopper rather than President of the U.S.A.?
('71', 4, 5, 16, 10506) G. But why should not a wood chopper be a President of the United States?
('71', 4, 5, 17, 10580) Gladstone used to chop wood.
('71', 4, 6, 18, 10609) C. But he did not accept it as his calling.
('71', 4, 6, 19, 10653) G. He would not have been worse off if he had done so.
('71', 4, 6, 20, 10708) What I mean is, one born a scavenger must earn his livelihood by being a scavenger, and then do whatever else he likes.
('71', 4, 6, 21, 10828) For a scanvenger is as worthy of his hire as a lawyer or your President.
('71', 4, 6, 22, 10901) That, according to me, is Hinduism.
('71', 4, 6, 23, 10937) There is no better communism on earth, and I have illustrated it with one verse from the Upanishads which means: God pervades allanimate and inanimate.
('71', 4, 6, 24, 11089) Therefore renounce all and dedicate it to God and then live.
('71', 4, 6, 25, 11150) The right of living is thus derived from renunciation.
('71', 4, 6, 26, 11205) It does not say, When all do their part of the work I too will do it.
('71', 4, 6, 27, 11275) It says, Dont bother about others, do your job first and leave the rest to Him.
('71', 4, 6, 28, 11355) Varnadharma acts even as the law of gravitation.
('71', 4, 6, 29, 11404) I cannot cancel it or its working by trying to jump higher and higher day by day till gravitation ceases to work.
('71', 4, 6, 30, 11518) That effort will be vain.
('71', 4, 6, 31, 11544) So is the effort to jump over one another.
('71', 4, 6, 32, 11587) The law of varna is the antithesis of competition which kills.

('71', 4, 7, 34, 11668) 2. LETTER TO KAMALNAYAN BAJAJ
('71', 4, 8, 35, 11698) SEGAON, February 26, 1937
('71', 4, 9, 36, 11724) KAMALNAYAN, I got your letter.
('71', 4, 9, 37, 11755) You are getting more and more involved and here everybody is talking of calling you back soon.
('71', 4, 9, 38, 11850) Your father in 
('71', 5, 0, 1, 11866) 6 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 5, 1, 2, 11906) law wants it to be early.
('71', 5, 1, 3, 11932) So does Jankibehn.
('71', 5, 1, 4, 11951) Father also is practically of the same view.
('71', 5, 1, 5, 11996) I am neutral, though I dont believe that you will bring home much from there.
('71', 5, 1, 6, 12074) But I wouldnt approve of calling you back so long as you are eager to continue there.
('71', 5, 1, 7, 12160) If you wish to take up business, you should give up your desire for a degree.
('71', 5, 1, 8, 12238) What will you do after becoming a barrister?
('71', 5, 1, 9, 12283) Or a graduate?
('71', 5, 1, 10, 12298) As I understand you, you wish to earn money.
('71', 5, 1, 11, 12343) You do not wish to live on Fathers money or to become a sannyasi.
('71', 5, 1, 12, 12409) If I am right, business is the proper field for you endeavour.
('71', 5, 1, 13, 12472) If you agree with this, give up the desire to be a barrister or to get a degree.
('71', 5, 1, 14, 12553) Your English must have improved sufficiently by now.
('71', 5, 1, 15, 12606) If, however, you are keen on a degree and on going to Oxford or Cambridge, you may see Deenbandhu Andrews.
('71', 5, 1, 16, 12713) Those whom I know at Oxford and Cambridge, I know through him.
('71', 5, 1, 17, 12776) Please, therefore, see him.
('71', 5, 1, 18, 12804) He will make the necessary arrangement for you.
('71', 5, 1, 19, 12852) He lives at Cambridge.
('71', 5, 1, 20, 12875) You know him, of course, but I am writing to him all the same.
('71', 5, 1, 21, 12938) He will, therefore, remember when you write to him.
('71', 5, 1, 22, 12990) His address is: Masters Lodge, Pembroke College, Cambridge.
('71', 5, 1, 23, 13050) Do whatever you do after full deliberation.
('71', 5, 1, 24, 13094) Keep writing to me.
('71', 5, 1, 25, 13114) You do seem to be a little lazy about writing.

('71', 5, 4, 29, 13253) February 26, 1937
('71', 5, 5, 30, 13271) KRISHNACHANDRA, Your letter.
('71', 5, 5, 31, 13300) What I meant was that if nothing is settled about you till then, you should do in July whatever you want to do.
('71', 5, 5, 32, 13412) I shall also help you to the best of my ability.
('71', 5, 5, 33, 13461) I hardly know anything about Ramana Maharshi.
('71', 5, 5, 34, 13507) Whatever I know is only at second hand.

('71', 5, 7, 36, 13622) 4. OUR CATTLE WEALTH
('71', 5, 8, 37, 13643) This is being written on Bakr Id daya day of rejoicing for Mussalmans and grief for Hindus.
('71', 5, 8, 38, 13735) It is day of grief for Hindus because their Mussalman brethern slaughter cows for sacrifice though
('71', 6, 0, 1, 13834) VOL.71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 7
('71', 6, 1, 2, 13875) they know that the cow is an object of worship and veneration for Hindus.
('71', 6, 1, 3, 13949) Though I hold the cow as much in veneration as any Hindu and am responsible for bringing into being the in my opinion only scientific society for effectively protecting the cow, I have never sympathized with the Hindu grief and the implied anger against Mussalmans on Bakr Id.
('71', 6, 1, 4, 14226) The latter are undoubtedly foolish and obstinate in that they slaughter the cow and needlessly wound Hindu susceptibility.
('71', 6, 1, 5, 14349) For there is no religious obligation on the part of Mussalmans to kill the cow on Bakr Id or any other day.
('71', 6, 1, 6, 14457) I have heard some Mussalmans arguing that Hindus by their worship of the cow make it obligatory on them to kill the cow.
('71', 6, 1, 7, 14578) This borders on compulsion.
('71', 6, 1, 8, 14606) But if the Mussalman is foolish and obstinate, the Hindu is criminally ignorant and indirectly becomes party to the slaughter of the cow by the Mussalman.
('71', 6, 1, 9, 14761) For cows are sold by Hindus as a rule.
('71', 6, 1, 10, 14800) Hindu grief and anger are uncalled for.
('71', 6, 1, 11, 14840) Hindu ignorance is responsible for many more deaths of cows than the deaths casused by the Mussalmans slaughter of the cow for one day in the year.
('71', 6, 1, 12, 14988) Be it noted that Hindus are apparently quite reconciled to cow slaughter on days other than Bakr Id.
('71', 6, 1, 13, 15089) I have in my possession startling authentic figures showing the annual slaughter of cattle and deaths from natural causes.
('71', 6, 1, 14, 15212) According to the livestock census of 1935 about 80 per cent die naturally and 20 per cent are slaughtered.
('71', 6, 1, 15, 15319) The percentage of natural death, however, varies according to locality.
('71', 6, 1, 16, 15391) Where grazing conditions are good and cultivation careful, natural deaths fall as low as 7 per cent, and in famine zones they rise to 30 per cent.
('71', 6, 1, 17, 15538) In the Bombay Presidency (British) it is estimated that there were, in 1935, 74.5 lakhs of cattle.
('71', 6, 1, 18, 15637) Of these 9 lakhs died naturally against 2 lakhs by slaughter, i.e., 12 per cent against 3 per cent.
('71', 6, 1, 19, 15737) In 1935 in British India, including Bengal and Bihar and Orissa, there were over eight crores of cows against just under three crores of buffaloes.
('71', 6, 1, 20, 15885) Comparison between the census of 1935 and 1930 shows that buffalo wealth is on the increase three times that of the cow.
('71', 6, 1, 21, 16006) Now it is common knowledge that the cow is generally owned by Hindus.
('71', 6, 1, 22, 16076) If they removed their unpardonable ignorance, they could easily prevent many deaths from natural causes.
('71', 6, 1, 23, 16181) I reproduce immediately below this note two extracts 1 showing why so many cattle die annually and what can and should be done to prevent this
('71', 6, 2, 24, 16324) 1 These are not reproduced here.
('71', 7, 0, 1, 16357) 8 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 7, 1, 2, 16397) tremenduous waste of wealth.
('71', 7, 1, 3, 16426) Time was when the number of cows was the measure of mans wealth.
('71', 7, 1, 4, 16491) Today the cows are a drag on a mans possessions.
('71', 7, 1, 5, 16540) It is almost like depreciation of currency.
('71', 7, 1, 6, 16584) The only difference is that prevention of depreciation of cattle or rather cow currency is possible by internal effort.
('71', 7, 1, 7, 16704) The effort is threefold: (1) No waste of energy over persuading Mussalmans to give up cow slaughter, whether for sacrifice or food.
('71', 7, 1, 8, 16836) They must be put on their own honour.
('71', 7, 1, 9, 16874) (2) Exclusive concentration on improvement of the cow and therefore giving up of buffalo milk and ghee.
('71', 7, 1, 10, 16978) (3) Exclusive use of dead cattle hide and free use other than for food of all the parts of carcasses, and improvement in tanning.
('71', 7, 1, 11, 17108) The material for improvement is ready at hand in the numerous pinjarapoles and goshalas covering the whole land.
('71', 7, 1, 12, 17221) The only thing needful is to remove certain prejudices and to conduct these institutions on sound scientific lines.

('71', 7, 2, 14, 17356) 5. VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE VICES
('71', 7, 3, 15, 17387) A khadi worker writes: 1
('71', 7, 4, 16, 17412) It is good question.
('71', 7, 4, 17, 17433) There should be no comparison of vices.
('71', 7, 4, 18, 17473) As for me, I look upon untruth as the root cause of all sins.
('71', 7, 4, 19, 17535) No institution which tolerates untruth can serve the community or survive for long.
('71', 7, 4, 20, 17619) But when a man resorts to untruthfulness, it assumes various forms.
('71', 7, 4, 21, 17687) It is a kind of immorality.
('71', 7, 4, 22, 17715) Untruth rarely parades itself in naked form.
('71', 7, 4, 23, 17760) An immoral person commits three sins.
('71', 7, 4, 24, 17798) He is guilty of untruthfulness because he hides his misbehaviour.
('71', 7, 4, 25, 17864) The misbehaviour itself is a sin.
('71', 7, 4, 26, 17898) And thirdly, it demoralizes the other person with whom he misbehaves.
('71', 7, 4, 27, 17968) All other vices which the correspondent has mentioned are abstract.
('71', 7, 4, 28, 18036) We can neither see them nor catch them.
('71', 7, 4, 29, 18076) They can be discussed only when they become manifest in action.
('71', 7, 4, 30, 18140) Then only is it possible to think of remedies for them.
('71', 7, 4, 31, 18196) Suppose a man hates another.
('71', 7, 4, 32, 18225) As long as that hatred does not lead to some action, the hatred cannot be criticized nor can the jealous person be improved.
('71', 7, 4, 33, 18350) But when that
('71', 7, 5, 34, 18364) 1 The letter is not translated here.
('71', 7, 5, 35, 18401) The correspondent had asked whether vices like untruth, jealousy and hatred were not more harmful than sexual lapses.
('71', 8, 0, 1, 18519) VOL.71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 9
('71', 8, 1, 2, 18560) hatred causes any harm to another, then it can be condemned and the person deserves punishment.
('71', 8, 1, 3, 18656) The fact is, sexual immorality is given a long rope in the social as well as the legal code, although it causes great harm to society.
('71', 8, 1, 4, 18791) The thief gets stringent punishment and the poor fellow is almost ostracized by society.
('71', 8, 1, 5, 18880) But the fashionable debauchee moves freely and goes scot free.
('71', 8, 1, 6, 18943) The law turns a blind eye to him.
('71', 8, 1, 7, 18977) I am convinced that an institution pledged to the service of millions should have no room for debauchees, just as it has no place for thives and rowdies.
('71', 8, 1, 8, 19131) [From Hindi] Harijan Sevak, 27 2 1937
('71', 8, 2, 9, 19169) 6. WHY SHOULD THREE ANNAS BE PAID?
('71', 8, 3, 10, 19204) I am discussing here a difficulty which I am faced with in Segaon in trying to put into practice to some extent the ideas which I had expressed regarding the rate of wages earned by women spinners for yarn spun by them.
('71', 8, 3, 11, 19424) I engage in, or permit, as little discussion as possible on the experiments which I am carrying on in Segaon and the hopes which I am entertaining because my experiments are still at a preliminary stage.
('71', 8, 3, 12, 19628) I neither show definite results nor see any myself.
('71', 8, 3, 13, 19680) I regard myself as an extremely cautious worker.
('71', 8, 3, 14, 19729) I work out each task in a scientific spirit.
('71', 8, 3, 15, 19774) A devotee of truth cannot function in any other way.
('71', 8, 3, 16, 19827) While working in that manner, I feel it would be thought improper for me to write anything at this stage about my experiments in Segaon.
('71', 8, 3, 17, 19964) But there can be nothing improper in saying what I have been unable to accomplish to this day.
('71', 8, 3, 18, 20059) Now, in my opinion, anyone who puts in one hour of diligent work should get one anna.
('71', 8, 3, 19, 20145) So that a woman who spins skilfully for an hour should also be paid one anna.
('71', 8, 3, 20, 20223) I have been unable to make any experienced person put this into effect; and that is as it should be.
('71', 8, 3, 21, 20324) If crores of Indians start earning an anna an hour, India would become an economically prosperous country.
('71', 8, 3, 22, 20431) Today, the average annual income of an Indian is fifty to sixty rupees; this is not the minimum income.
('71', 8, 3, 23, 20535) If instead, the minimum income becomes one hundred and eighty rupees no one would starve.
('71', 8, 3, 24, 20625) However, in Segaon, to this day, I have not been able to pay three annas for eight hours work to any unemployed person.
('71', 8, 3, 25, 20745) In Segaon the rate for a man is three annas and for a woman five to six pice.
('71', 8, 3, 26, 20823) Children of fifteen or sixteen earn something in between.
('71', 9, 0, 1, 20881) 10 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 9, 1, 2, 20922) could have my way, I would see to it that women are paid the same wages as men.
('71', 9, 1, 3, 21002) But I have been unable to do even this little bit.
('71', 9, 1, 4, 21053) And I have been unable to pay, or make others pay, the same rate to the unemployed as is paid to labourers in Segaon.
('71', 9, 1, 5, 21171) This is because the rate I have mentioned applies to those who do not ordinarily remain unemployed.
('71', 9, 1, 6, 21271) What I desire is the capacity to pay three annas for eight hours labour to whosover comes in search of work.
('71', 9, 1, 7, 21380) I have not been able to achieve that or make much progress.
('71', 9, 1, 8, 21440) I cannot accept that I alone am to blame for this.
('71', 9, 1, 9, 21491) Partly no doubt my own failing is responsible.
('71', 9, 1, 10, 21538) But it is for this reason that I have proved for myself and others like me the necessity for living in village.
('71', 9, 1, 11, 21650) It is not true that a few months stay in the villages enables one to solve all its problems.
('71', 9, 1, 12, 21743) I have never imagined it can.
('71', 9, 1, 13, 21773) One can have a grasp of rural problems and find solutions for them only when one stays in a village like a true villager from three to five years.
('71', 9, 1, 14, 21920) Here I have merely noted the difficulties experienced in paying even the unemployed the wage of three annas.
('71', 9, 1, 15, 22029) At the root of this difficulty I see our inveterate idleness.
('71', 9, 1, 16, 22091) The unemployed are so indifferent that if entrusted with some work of which they have no experience, they are not even prepared to consider it.
('71', 9, 1, 17, 22235) They have formed the habit of agreeing to everything, so they will nod their heads in assent to any suggestion but will do nothing beyond that.
('71', 9, 1, 18, 22379) However, by mentioning these difficulties I have by no means expressed my despondency.
('71', 9, 1, 19, 22466) I have expressed my sympathy towards other colleagues who experience similar difficulty.
('71', 9, 1, 20, 22555) Idleness which has persisted for years cannot be got rid of all at once.
('71', 9, 1, 21, 22628) Patience is what is required.
('71', 9, 1, 22, 22658) We do not wish to give three annas or even more for eight hours work by way of a gift, but we wish to create conditions where people can earn this amount.
('71', 9, 1, 23, 22813) In trying to achieve this lies the education and the test of social workers as well as villagers.
('71', 9, 1, 24, 22911) [From Gujarati] Harijanbandhu, 28 2 1937
('71', 9, 2, 25, 22952) 7. DEFINITION OF POVERTY
('71', 9, 3, 26, 22977) While discussing the question of providing work to the poor living in villages, a gentleman writes to say:
('71', 9, 4, 27, 23084) You had once said that those who engaged labourers to plough their fields could not be called poor.
('71', 9, 4, 28, 23184) But that is not enough.
('71', 9, 4, 29, 23208) Can it be said that those who do not suffer from want of food and clothing and do not have to incur debts are not poor?
('71', 10, 0, 1, 23328) VOL.71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 11
('71', 10, 1, 2, 23370) This question may be answered in the affirmative as well as in the negative.
('71', 10, 1, 3, 23447) If we consider the matter from the standpoint of health, few persons in the Indian climate suffer from want of clothes.
('71', 10, 1, 4, 23567) This is because innumerable persons can do with loincloths, and it may be said that it does not harm the health.
('71', 10, 1, 5, 23680) But even persons said to belong to the middle class do not get a proper diet from the nutritional standpoint.
('71', 10, 1, 6, 23790) Except for a few wealthy people, all others are unable to get sufficient milk, ghee, vegetables and fruit.
('71', 10, 1, 7, 23897) They may well afford a drop of dirty milk adulterated with water, and a small quantity of vegetables, but they never get fruit.
('71', 10, 1, 8, 24025) And because of the want of these three things, crores of people in India, including those of the middleclass, can never maintain good health.
('71', 10, 1, 9, 24167) Hence, if we examine the matter from the standpoint of health, the number of poor people increases greatly.
('71', 10, 1, 10, 24275) This however is not the standpoint of the correspondent.
('71', 10, 1, 11, 24332) For him the question of poverty has arisen in the context of the problem of a minimum wage.
('71', 10, 1, 12, 24424) My definition of poverty, if considered from that standpoint would run as follows: Those who, despite working the whole day, cannot earn even three annas are all poor, because the correspondent has before him only the problem of providing work to the unemployed in the villages.
('71', 10, 1, 13, 24703) Although this is an imperfect definition, it is of importance to workers.
('71', 10, 1, 14, 24777) The reason being that if poverty is considered from the standpoint of health, etc., all villagers and many city dwellers also would be regarded as poorand actually, they are so.
('71', 10, 1, 15, 24955) But such a definition confuses the workers.
('71', 10, 1, 16, 24999) This does not mean that such persons should not be served.
('71', 10, 1, 17, 25058) The village worker is constantly faced with problems of sanitation, health and economic betterment.
('71', 10, 1, 18, 25158) He is constantly faced with problems of how people should get pure milk and butter milk in their own villages, how they can obtain vegetables and fruit, how those who do not get sufficient coverings for the winter can do so.
('71', 10, 1, 19, 25383) And his skill lies in solving these.
('71', 10, 1, 20, 25420) But no one can solve all problems at once.
('71', 10, 1, 21, 25463) It is for this very reason that I have given a working definition of poverty so that everyone can realize that it is their dharma to serve the maximum number of poor people and make a beginning in that direction.

('71', 11, 3, 5, 25888) I see no necessity for you to do anything which would hurt your parents feelings.
('71', 11, 3, 6, 25970) It is only when parents push the children into an obviously immoral course of action that the latter are entitled to disregard them.
('71', 11, 3, 7, 26103) There is nothing of the sort in your case.
('71', 11, 3, 8, 26146) In many matters your parents are ready to go along with you.
('71', 11, 3, 9, 26207) You can do a lot of service even while doing business.
('71', 11, 3, 10, 26262) The ability to earn an honest cowrie is not easy to acquire.
('71', 11, 3, 11, 26323) Even doing that is a form of service and also tests ones intelligence.
('71', 11, 3, 12, 26394) For the present, therefore, continue patiently to do what you are doing.
('71', 11, 3, 13, 26467) Continue to write to me whenever necessary.

('71', 12, 13, 24, 28172) DEAR GURUDEV, Your letter 2 has caused me much distress.
('71', 12, 13, 25, 28229) That a letter 3 which was written out of love and reverence should have been so misunderstood is a revelation.
('71', 12, 13, 26, 28340) There was no question of suspicion and, therefore, no question of misjudging you.

('71', 14, 9, 21, 31662) There is no reason at all to be scared of hip baths.
('71', 14, 9, 22, 31715) The secret is that you should not feel cold while sitting in the tub and the body should be sufficiently warm after coming out of the tub.
('71', 14, 9, 23, 31854) For this, you should bring warmth to the body either by walking or by covering yourself up in bed or by pouring over yourself a few mugs of hot water after the hip bath.

('71', 15, 1, 2, 32065) Friction bath can be taken .
('71', 15, 1, 3, 32094) 1 The bather should perch on a stool, with the private parts kept away from the edge of the stool.
('71', 15, 1, 4, 32193) They should then be rubbed with a piece of cloth repeatedly soaked in the tub water.
('71', 15, 1, 5, 32278) This is what is called friction bath.
('71', 15, 1, 6, 32316) The idea behind it is as follows: there is a complex of nerves at the opening of the organ.
('71', 15, 1, 7, 32408) The effect on them spreads throughout the body with lightning speed.
('71', 15, 1, 8, 32477) This effect is quite the opposite of that produced by masturbation and other bad habits.
('71', 15, 1, 9, 32566) And this checks many diseases and cures many others.
('71', 15, 1, 10, 32619) Garlic should not be chewed.
('71', 15, 1, 11, 32648) It should be ground and mixed with vegetables like a sauce.
('71', 15, 1, 12, 32708) Some people take it with curds.
('71', 15, 1, 13, 32740) If youcan get fresh garlic it is better than dry garlic.
('71', 15, 1, 14, 32797) If sweet limes and oranges are available no other fruits are required.
('71', 15, 1, 15, 32868) If you can get good palm gur, you can carry on well with it.
('71', 15, 1, 16, 32929) You must get good milk.
('71', 15, 1, 17, 32953) A person like you cannot stay where good milk is not available.
('71', 15, 1, 18, 33017) Garlic never gives a cold, rather it cures a cold.
('71', 15, 1, 19, 33068) I can say without hesitation that the increase in Chimanlals weight is due to his taking earth treatment.

('71', 16, 5, 27, 35222) He must make a determined effort to improve it, within the limits voluntarily accepted by him.
('71', 16, 5, 28, 35317) In the matter of improving ones health, lethargy is a sin.
('71', 16, 5, 29, 35376) The human body is both a Kurukshetra and a dharmakshetra.

('71', 17, 2, 3, 35703) March 3, 1937
('71', 17, 3, 4, 35717) It was impossible to come to India and go away without seeing you, they said to Gandhiji, to which Gandhiji jokingly said: And yet you come here at the fag end of your visit.
('71', 17, 4, 5, 35892) With Gandhiji the only topic they discussed was that of cementing the relation between India and Egypt.
('71', 17, 5, 6, 35996) GANDHIJI: I should heartily welcome the co operation.
('71', 17, 6, 7, 36050) SHEIKH IBRAHIM EL GIBALI: We hope the day will not be far off when India regains her past glory and revives her ancient civilization.
('71', 17, 6, 8, 36184) We have many things in common, climate, colour, food, and we are orientals.
('71', 17, 6, 9, 36260) The time has come for us to come closer together.
('71', 17, 7, 10, 36310) HABIB AHMED : We have discovered it is not good fot both the countries to rely on their older generations.
('71', 17, 7, 11, 36417) They should rely more on the younger generations.
('71', 17, 7, 12, 36467) Our youths should go to India and yours should come to Egypt as sportsmen.
('71', 17, 8, 13, 36542) G. Not only may we have an exchange and a mixing together in the field of sport but we should have it in the field of education.
('71', 17, 8, 14, 36671) We should invite professors from Egypt and you should invite those from India, so that we may develop cultural contacts.
('71', 17, 9, 15, 36792) SHEIKH IBRAHIM EL GIBALI: This end can be attained if there is an intellectual fusion of blood between both countries.
('71', 17, 9, 16, 36911) G. That is true, and to reach some kind of solution I would suggest your making a public declaration of this kind.
('71', 17, 9, 17, 37026) I make an offer.
('71', 17, 9, 18, 37043) If you kindly send an Egyptian lad of intelligence and resourcefulness, we will welcome him and adopt him here.
('71', 17, 9, 19, 37155) You will see the maker of this place, Jamnalal Bajaj.
('71', 17, 9, 20, 37209) There is not a public institution here which does not owe its existence to him.
('71', 17, 9, 21, 37289) He has had no college education, but he has a heart of gold and he has lavishly given of his gold for the welfare of the country.
('71', 17, 9, 22, 37419) He has a school here where he has Hindu and Mussalman boys.
('71', 17, 9, 23, 37479) There is provisionthere for Urdu teaching for Mussalman boys.
('71', 17, 9, 24, 37541) He has secured a Principal who is an ideal teacher.
('71', 17, 9, 25, 37593) So if you will send a promising lad, we will adopt him here and he will be like a seed which will grow into a mighty tree.
('71', 17, 9, 26, 37716) Then there is the Jamia Millia in Delhi where there are fine men like Dr. Zakir Husain, Prof.
('71', 17, 9, 27, 37810) Mujeeb; and you can exchange boys and professors with the Jamia.

('71', 18, 9, 19, 39000) SURENDRA, I am having consultations about the date of your marriage.
('71', 18, 9, 20, 39069) I gather that you desire the marriage to take place in proper style.
('71', 18, 9, 21, 39138) You are even thinking of a gathering of friends.
('71', 18, 9, 22, 39187) If that is so, please let me know your reason.
('71', 18, 9, 23, 39234) One reason I have understood.
('71', 18, 9, 24, 39264) You feel that all of us elders have enjoyed celebrations of marriages in our time andnow we are out to stop persons like you from doing that, and you ask why.
('71', 18, 9, 25, 39423) This is a pure misconception.
('71', 18, 9, 26, 39453) If, according to our custom, we regard marriage as a festive occasion, a person can enjoy the celebration only once.
('71', 18, 9, 27, 39570) Now as regards myself, I may tell you that whatever happened when I was only twelve years of age.
('71', 18, 9, 28, 39668) My parents did not ask for my consent in regard to anything.
('71', 18, 9, 29, 39729) If anybody had enjoyed the celebrations, it was they and the other relatives.
('71', 18, 9, 30, 39807) I am not aware of having enjoyed the occasion.
('71', 18, 9, 31, 39854) Whatever fun I may have had at that time was much in the same way as children enjoy play.
('71', 18, 9, 32, 39944) I had no sense at all of the responsibility of the occasion.

('71', 19, 1, 2, 40103) celebration.
('71', 19, 1, 3, 40116) I do not know anything of Kishorelal.
('71', 19, 1, 4, 40154) You need not, therefore, envy my enjoyment.
('71', 19, 1, 5, 40198) What I wish is that on the day fixed you should come alone.
('71', 19, 1, 6, 40258) I will get all the religious ceremonies performed and, after they are over, you may take away Manu on the very same day.
('71', 19, 1, 7, 40379) If you want to have a gathering of friends, you may have one at Akola or Bombay.
('71', 19, 1, 8, 40460) I have no zest at all for such things.
('71', 19, 1, 9, 40499) I am not talking about renunciation but only about common duty.
('71', 19, 1, 10, 40563) Nowadays some thinkers have elevated sensual enjoyment to the position of a dharma.
('71', 19, 1, 11, 40647) I have not been able to accept this view.
('71', 19, 1, 12, 40689) In my opinion marriage is a means of observing self control.
('71', 19, 1, 13, 40750) It is desirable that men and women should have only one connection and not many.
('71', 19, 1, 14, 40831) This is their duty.
('71', 19, 1, 15, 40851) Marriage should be for service, not for self indulgence.
('71', 19, 1, 16, 40908) The relationship of man and woman is only for progeny and should have no other purpose.
('71', 19, 1, 17, 40996) This is the ideal.
('71', 19, 1, 18, 41015) Certainly one cannot say that this ideal is wrong simply because it cannot be attained.
('71', 19, 1, 19, 41103) But if it is right, it is ones duty to follow it in practice to the best of ones ability.
('71', 19, 1, 20, 41193) And if such is indeed ones duty, then the marriage ceremony should be made as religious, quiet and austere as possible.
('71', 19, 1, 21, 41313) If you understand this, then you and Manu should look upon marriage as a new birth and should enter it with a sense of duty.
('71', 19, 1, 22, 41438) Do not regard marriage as a festive occasion but enter the householders estate with the blessings of elders and with full understanding of the meaning of marriage.
('71', 19, 1, 23, 41602) If you have understood this, you will give up insisting on inviting anybody.
('71', 19, 1, 24, 41679) If I can I will stop even Nanabhai, Neelkanth and others from coming and wasting money on travelling.
('71', 19, 1, 25, 41781) Notwithstanding these views of mine, however, I do not wish to hurt you.
('71', 19, 1, 26, 41854) You may, therefore, unhesitatingly let me know whatever you desire.
('71', 19, 1, 27, 41922) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] Manu has read this letter and agrees with me.

('71', 20, 9, 17, 42998) SEGAON, WARDHA, March 5, 1937 DEAR RAJARAM, I was glad to have your letter and to notice that you stood the strain of the election campaign without any physical ill effect.
('71', 20, 9, 18, 43171) I hope that you will make the wisest use of the position you have obtained.

('71', 21, 2, 3, 43459) SEGAON, WARDHA, March 5, 1937
('71', 21, 3, 4, 43489) MAMA, I got your letter.
('71', 21, 3, 5, 43514) I have studied the plan.
('71', 21, 3, 6, 43539) I once again remembered the original ashram at Godhra.
('71', 21, 3, 7, 43594) After spending Rs. 3,000, how many untouchables will you have uplifted?
('71', 21, 3, 8, 43666) I cannot understand your scheme.
('71', 21, 3, 9, 43699) I was under the impression that you would spend at the most Rs. 1,000. Your plan is suitable not for a temple but for a princes court or palace.
('71', 21, 3, 10, 43844) But what can I say when a donor like Sardar is ready to satisfy you?
('71', 21, 3, 11, 43913) But if I got Rs. 3,000, I would spend out of it not more than Rs. 1,000 on a hut for myself, fencing and the temple, and spend the rest in the service of the Harijans in other ways.
('71', 21, 3, 12, 44095) Kaka has gone to Calcutta.
('71', 21, 3, 13, 44122) I am sending your plan first to Vinoba and then to Kishorelal.
('71', 21, 3, 14, 44185) At the earliest I could have replied yesterday, but that could not be done.

('71', 21, 7, 18, 44362) [March 5, 1937] 2
('71', 21, 8, 19, 44380) Mr. Keithahn...
('71', 21, 8, 20, 44396) was not quite sure what was at the back of Gandhijis mind when he said that all religions were not only true but equal.
('71', 21, 8, 21, 44516) Scientifically, he felt, it was hardly correct to say that all religions are equal.
('71', 21, 8, 22, 44600) People would make comparisons between animists and theists.
('71', 21, 8, 23, 44660) I would say, said Mr. Keithahn, it is no use comparing religions.
('71', 21, 8, 24, 44726) They are different ways.
('71', 21, 8, 25, 44751) Do you think we can explain the thing in different terms?
('71', 21, 9, 26, 44809) GANDHIJI: You are right when you say that it is impossible to compare them.
('71', 21, 9, 27, 44885) But the deduction from it is that they are equal.
('71', 21, 9, 28, 44935) All men are born free and equal, but one is much stronger or weeker than another physically and mentally.
('71', 21, 9, 29, 45041) Therefore superficially there is
('71', 21, 10, 30, 45074) 1 Extracted from Mahadev Desais Weekly Letter.
('71', 21, 10, 31, 45121) R.R. Keithahn was an American missionary.
('71', 21, 10, 32, 45163) 2 From the manuscript of Mahadev Desais Diary
('71', 22, 0, 1, 45209) VOL.71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 23
('71', 22, 1, 2, 45251) noequality between the two.
('71', 22, 1, 3, 45279) But there is an essential equality: in our nakedness.
('71', 22, 1, 4, 45333) God is not going to think of me as Gandhi and you as Keithahn.
('71', 22, 1, 5, 45396) And what are we in this mighty universe?
('71', 22, 1, 6, 45437) We are less than atoms, and as between atoms there is no use asking which is smaller and which is bigger.
('71', 22, 1, 7, 45543) Inherently we are equal.
('71', 22, 1, 8, 45568) The differences of race and skin and of mind and body and of climate and nation are transitory.
('71', 22, 1, 9, 45664) In the same way essentially all religions are equal.
('71', 22, 1, 10, 45717) If you read the Koran, you must read it with the eye of the Muslim; if you read the Bible, you must read it with the eye of the Christian; if you read the Gita, you must read it with the eye of a Hindu.
('71', 22, 1, 11, 45920) Where is the use of scanning details and then holding up a religion to ridicule?
('71', 22, 1, 12, 46001) Take the very first chapter of Genesis or of Matthew.
('71', 22, 1, 13, 46055) We read a long pedigree and then at the end we are told that Jesus was born of a virgin.
('71', 22, 1, 14, 46144) You come up against a blind wall.
('71', 22, 1, 15, 46178) But I must read it all with the eye of a Christian.
('71', 22, 2, 16, 46230) K. Then even in our Bible, there is the question of Moses and Jesus.
('71', 22, 2, 17, 46299) We must hold them to be equal.
('71', 22, 3, 18, 46330) G. Yes.
('71', 22, 3, 19, 46338) All prophets are equal.
('71', 22, 3, 20, 46362) It is a horizontal plane.
('71', 22, 4, 21, 46388) K. If we think in terms of Einsteins relativity all are equal.
('71', 22, 4, 22, 46451) But I cannot happily express that equality.
('71', 22, 5, 23, 46495) G. This is why I say they are equally true and equally imperfect.
('71', 22, 5, 24, 46561) The finer the line you draw, the nearer it approaches Euclids true staight line, but it never is true straight line.
('71', 22, 5, 25, 46678) The tree of religion is the same, there is not that physical equality between the branches.
('71', 22, 5, 26, 46770) They are all growing, and the person who belongs to the growing branch must not gloat over it and say, Mine is the superior one.
('71', 22, 5, 27, 46899) None is superior, none is inferior, to the other.
('71', 22, 5, 28, 46949) Harijan, 13 3 1937
('71', 22, 6, 29, 46968) 28. DISCUSSION WITH A ROMAN CATHOLIC PRIEST 1
('71', 22, 7, 30, 47014) [March 5, 1937] 2
('71', 22, 8, 31, 47032) A Roman Catholic Father who saw Gandhiji the other day asked how Gandhiji proposed to break the caste.
('71', 22, 9, 32, 47135) GANDHIJI: It is already breaking.
('71', 22, 9, 33, 47169) All it requires is education, and under the education that is being imparted for some time it is breaking.
('71', 22, 9, 34, 47276) But by education I do not mean literary education but
('71', 22, 10, 35, 47330) 1 Extracted from Mahadev Desais Weekly Letter 2 From the manuscript of Mahadev Desais Diary
('71', 23, 0, 1, 47422) 24 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 23, 1, 2, 47463) thespread of true knowledge.
('71', 23, 1, 3, 47492) Caste has no religious basis, but it is certainly regarded as bound up with religion, though it is not derived from the scriptures.
('71', 23, 1, 4, 47624) Untouchability is the last word on caste, and as soon as untouchability goes, caste goes.
('71', 23, 1, 5, 47714) The outcaste has been all over the world.
('71', 23, 1, 6, 47756) In Europe the Jews were outcastes and confined to the ghettos where life was much worse than in the untouchables quarters.
('71', 23, 1, 7, 47879) The degradation to which the outcastes in India are reduced is bad enough, but what one knew of ghettos from Israel Zangwills works, which years ago I read at the instance of a friend, was something blood curdling.
('71', 23, 1, 8, 48094) Such a thing cannot happen in India, because of the non violence of a sort that we are practising.
('71', 23, 1, 9, 48193) However, though we have no ghettos, there is nothing to choose between them and untoucha bility.
('71', 23, 1, 10, 48290) Take untouchability out and the fabric of caste is destroyed.
('71', 23, 2, 11, 48352) And here Gandhiji explained the distinction between caste and varna, which
('71', 23, 3, 12, 48427) was not only a law for the Hindus but a universal law, to which we confirm, with or
('71', 23, 4, 13, 48511) without knowledge, and if we do not, we do so at our peril.
('71', 23, 4, 14, 48571) Caste had been the best
('71', 23, 5, 15, 48595) target for missionaries to assail Hinduism with, and rightly, but caste in the sense of
('71', 23, 6, 16, 48683) varna and trade guilds, as Sir W. W. Hunter 1 described it, will live forever.
('71', 23, 6, 17, 48762) CATHOLIC FATHER: If Hinduism became monotheistic, Christianity and Hinduism can serve India in co operation.
('71', 23, 7, 18, 48871) G. I would love to see the co operation happen, but it cannot if the present day Christian mission persist in holding up Hinduism to ridicule and saying that no one can go to Heaven unless he renounces and denounces Hinduism.
('71', 23, 7, 19, 49097) But I can conceive a good Christian, silently working away, and shedding the sweet aroma of his life on Hindu communities, like the rose which does not need any speech to spread its fragrance but spreads it because it must.
('71', 23, 7, 20, 49321) Even so a truly spiritual life.
('71', 23, 7, 21, 49353) Then surely there would be peace on earth and goodwill among men.
('71', 23, 7, 22, 49419) But not so long as there is militant or muscular Christianity.
('71', 23, 7, 23, 49482) This is not to be found in the Bible, but you find it in Germany and other countries.
('71', 23, 8, 24, 49568) R.C.F. But if Indians begin to believe in one God and give up idolatry, dont you think the whole difficulty will be solved?
('71', 23, 9, 25, 49692) G. Will the Christians be satisfied with it?
('71', 23, 9, 26, 49737) Are they all united?
('71', 23, 10, 27, 49758) R. C .F. Of course all the Christian sects are not united.
('71', 23, 11, 28, 49817) 1 A member of the Viceroys Council, he directed the statistical survey of Indian Empire (1869 81), whose reports were later condensed in The Imperial Gazetteer of India.
('71', 24, 0, 1, 49987) VOL.71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 25
('71', 24, 1, 2, 50029) G. Then you are asking only a theoretical question.
('71', 24, 1, 3, 50081) And may I ask you, is there any amalgamation between Islam and Christianity, though both are said to believe in one God?
('71', 24, 1, 4, 50202) If these two have not amalgamated, there is less hope of amalgamation of Christians and Hindus along the lines you suggest.
('71', 24, 1, 5, 50326) I have my own solution, but the first instance I dispute the description that Hindus believe in many gods and are idolators.
('71', 24, 1, 6, 50451) They do say there are many gods, but they also declare unmistakably that there is One God, God of gods.
('71', 24, 1, 7, 50555) It is therefore not proper to suggest that Hindus believe in many gods.
('71', 24, 1, 8, 50627) They certainly believe in many worlds.
('71', 24, 1, 9, 50666) Just as there is a world inhabited by men and another by beasts, so also is there one inhabited by superior beings called gods, whom we do not see but who nevertheless exist.
('71', 24, 1, 10, 50841) The whole mischief is created by the English rendering of the words deva or devta for which you have not found a better term than god.
('71', 24, 1, 11, 50976) But god is Ishwara, Devadhideva, God of gods.
('71', 24, 1, 12, 51022) So you see it is the word god, used to describe different divine beings, that has given rise to such confusion.
('71', 24, 1, 13, 51134) I believe that I am a thorough Hindu but I never believe in many gods.
('71', 24, 1, 14, 51205) Never even in my childhood did I hold that belief, and no one ever taught me to do so.
('71', 24, 1, 15, 51292) As for idol worship, you cannot do without it in some form or other.
('71', 24, 1, 16, 51361) Why does a Mussalman give his life for defending a mosque which he calls a house of God?
('71', 24, 1, 17, 51450) And why does a Christian go to a church and when he is required to take an oath swear by the Bible?
('71', 24, 1, 18, 51550) Not that I see any objection to it.
('71', 24, 1, 19, 51586) And what is it if not idolatry to give untold riches for building mosques and tombs?
('71', 24, 1, 20, 51671) And what do the Roman Catholics do when they kneel before Virgin Mary and before saintsquite imaginary figures in stone or painted on canvas or glass?
('71', 24, 2, 21, 51822) R. C .F. But I keep my mothers photo and kiss it in veneration of her.
('71', 24, 2, 22, 51893) But I do not worship it, nor do I worship saints.
('71', 24, 2, 23, 51943) When I worship God, I acknowledge Him as Creator and greater than any human being.
('71', 24, 3, 24, 52026) G. Even so, it is not the stone we worship but it is God we worship in images of stone or metal however crude they may be.
('71', 24, 4, 25, 52149) R. C .F. But villagers worship stones as God.
('71', 24, 5, 26, 52195) G. No, I tell you they do not worship anything that is less than God.
('71', 24, 5, 27, 52265) When you kneel before Virgin Mary and ask for her intercession, what do you do?
('71', 24, 5, 28, 52345) You ask to establish contact with God through her.
('71', 24, 5, 29, 52396) Even so a Hindu seeks to establish contact with God through a stone image.
('71', 24, 5, 30, 52471) I can understand your asking for the Virginsintercession.
('71', 24, 5, 31, 52529) Why are Mussalmans filled with awe and
('71', 25, 0, 1, 52568) 26 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 25, 1, 2, 52609) exultation when they enter a mosque?
('71', 25, 1, 3, 52646) Why, is not the whole universe a mosque?
('71', 25, 1, 4, 52687) And what about the magnificent canopy of heaven that spreads over you?
('71', 25, 1, 5, 52758) Is it any less than a mosque?
('71', 25, 1, 6, 52788) But I understand and sympathize with the Muslims.
('71', 25, 1, 7, 52838) It is their way of approach to God.
('71', 25, 1, 8, 52874) The Hindus have their own way of approach to the same Eternal Being.
('71', 25, 1, 9, 52943) Our media of approach are different, but that does not make Him different.
('71', 25, 2, 10, 53018) R. C .F. But the Catholics believe that God revealed to them the true way.
('71', 25, 3, 11, 53093) G. But why do you say that the will of God is expressed only in one book called the Bible and not in others?
('71', 25, 3, 12, 53202) Why do you circumscribe the power of God?
('71', 25, 4, 13, 53244) R. C .F. But Jesus proved that he had received the word of God through miracles.
('71', 25, 5, 14, 53325) G. But that is Mahomeds claim too.
('71', 25, 5, 15, 53360) If you accept Christian testimony you must accept Muslim testimony and Hindu testmony too.
('71', 25, 6, 16, 53451) R. C. F. But Mahomed said he could not do miracles.
('71', 25, 7, 17, 53503) He did not want to prove the existence of God by miracles.
('71', 25, 7, 18, 53562) But he claimed to receive messages from God.
('71', 25, 8, 19, 53607) R. C. F. We are glad the Congress has had a great success.
('71', 25, 8, 20, 53666) But what about its veering round to communism?
('71', 25, 9, 21, 53713) G. Has it?
('71', 25, 9, 22, 53724) I do not see it.
('71', 25, 9, 23, 53741) But if it does, and if it is not the Russian model, I do not mind it.
('71', 25, 9, 24, 53811) For what does communism mean in the last analysis?
('71', 25, 9, 25, 53862) It means a classless societyan ideal that is worth striving for.
('71', 25, 9, 26, 53927) Only I part company with it when force is called to aid for achieving it.
('71', 25, 9, 27, 54001) We are all born equal, but we have all these centuries resisted the will of God.
('71', 25, 9, 28, 54082) The idea of inequality, of high and low is an evil, but I do not believe in eradicating evil from the human breast at the point of the bayonet.
('71', 25, 9, 29, 54226) The human breast does not lend itself to that means.
('71', 25, 10, 30, 54279) R. C. F. When Hinduism comes to power, will it not make a united front against Christianity?
('71', 25, 10, 31, 54372) There are all the signs of Hinduism coming to power.
('71', 25, 10, 32, 54425) And if it happens here, as it is happening in Spain, Indian Christians will be despised and persecuted and swept off.
('71', 25, 11, 33, 54543) G. It is an impossible picture.
('71', 25, 11, 34, 54575) There is no such thing as Hindu rule, there will be no such thing.
('71', 25, 11, 35, 54642) How can anyone eradicate a population of seven million Christians?
('71', 25, 11, 36, 54709) And that persupposes the
('71', 26, 0, 1, 54734) VOL.71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 27
('71', 26, 1, 2, 54776) destruction of Mussalmans too!
('71', 26, 1, 3, 54807) Let me tell you that no Hindu in his wildest imagination ever thought of this.
('71', 26, 1, 4, 54886) Will the world tolerate any such thing?
('71', 26, 1, 5, 54926) If Hinduism ever sought to do it, it would be committing suicide.
('71', 26, 1, 6, 54992) But I tell you that has never been the desire of the Hindus.
('71', 26, 1, 7, 55053) Hinduism was well able to destroy the first Christians that came.
('71', 26, 1, 8, 55119) Why did it not do anything of the kind?
('71', 26, 1, 9, 55159) Travancore is a brilliant example of toleration.
('71', 26, 1, 10, 55208) I was asked while I was there to see the most ancient church where St. Thomas is said to have planted the first Cross.
('71', 26, 1, 11, 55327) Why should he have been allowed to plant it?
('71', 26, 2, 12, 55372) R. C. F. But in St. Francis Xaviers time 1 there came a time when Christians
('71', 26, 3, 13, 55449) were persecuted.
('71', 26, 3, 14, 55466) But I do not know history and my information may be incorrect.
('71', 26, 4, 15, 55529) what makes me afraid is what I actually saw and heard in Japan.
('71', 26, 4, 16, 55593) There I heard in a
('71', 26, 5, 17, 55612) public speech a responsible man saying, Buddhism is the religion of Japan, we must
('71', 26, 6, 18, 55695) consolidate it, all other religions should be destroyed.
('71', 26, 7, 19, 55752) G. Well, well, no Hindu dreams of such a thing.
('71', 26, 7, 20, 55800) Even if he dreamt it, it would be impossible.
('71', 26, 8, 21, 55846) But now the Father revealed his bugbearArya Samaj!
('71', 26, 9, 22, 55897) G. I agree that the Arya Samaj represents a type of militant Hinduism, but they never believed in the cult of the sword.
('71', 26, 9, 23, 56018) The worst thing they are capable of is to ask you to become a Hindu if you went and spoke on their platform!
('71', 26, 10, 24, 56127) R. C. F. But I have heard Arya Samajists say that Christianity is a Western religion, and as everything that comes from the West is to be discarded, Christianity must also be discarded.
('71', 26, 11, 25, 56313) G. I have never heard of the talk of Christianity being blotted out of India.
('71', 26, 11, 26, 56391) The Arya Samaj is a community that asks its followers to go to the ends of the earth to preach Arya Dharma, but they have not yet done so.
('71', 26, 11, 27, 56530) It has a firm foothold in the Punjab.
('71', 26, 11, 28, 56568) Arya supremacy in the sense you dread is an inconceivable thing.
('71', 26, 11, 29, 56633) The Hindus are really not the major community if you put the rest together.
('71', 26, 11, 30, 56709) But why should I prolong the discussion?
('71', 26, 11, 31, 56750) It is not a practical proposition at all.

('71', 27, 1, 2, 56902) 29. AS OTHER SEE US
('71', 27, 2, 3, 56922) Here is a letter 1 which has been lying on my file for some time:
('71', 27, 3, 4, 56988) Your attitude towards religious conversion and particularly the hope
('71', 27, 4, 5, 57057) you entertain for the Depressed Classes within the fold of Hinduism,
('71', 27, 5, 6, 57126) overlooks the prevalent practices of Hinduism as it exists in India today...
('71', 27, 6, 7, 57203) Any religion is judged by its fruits.
('71', 27, 6, 8, 57241) Here is a contrast.
('71', 27, 6, 9, 57261) Take the case of the Christian religion, whether Roman Catholic or Protestant.
('71', 27, 6, 10, 57340) The funds that are collected from the rich and poor are carefully accounted for and repaid in the form of medical and educational service.
('71', 27, 6, 11, 57479) Religious worship is open to all alike.
('71', 27, 6, 12, 57519) The number of schools, colleges, dispensaries, hospitals and orphanges admirably served by their religious institution bear eloquent testimony to the quality of faith that is in them.
('71', 27, 6, 13, 57703) It is not a theology and philosophy which they possess but the self sacrificing service which they render in abundant measure towards all that is a contrast to the service rendered by the temples and mutts.
('71', 27, 6, 14, 57910) What are the uses of the wealth of temples and mutts?
('71', 27, 6, 15, 57964) Are not these weapons of superstition and oppression?
('71', 27, 6, 16, 58018) The heads of these mutts live princely lives with vast endowments,.
('71', 27, 6, 17, 58086) I am informed that there are regular lawyers to collect dues and serve the interests of these religious heads, swamis and gurus.
('71', 27, 6, 18, 58215) This state of affairs is an oppression worse than popery in its worst days.
('71', 27, 6, 19, 58291) Not merely the accumulated wealth and the annual collections, which in all these mutts must amount to several crores, are never properly accounted for, but this gigantic system of ghastly exploitation continues to be supported by the most intellectual leaders of the people as if Hindu society will break up by questioning it.
('71', 27, 6, 20, 58618) This is practical Hinduism.
('71', 27, 6, 21, 58646) Why should there be any surprise that the Depressed Classes alone should revolt against a system which denies them equal rights to worship the Deity but keeps them also in perpetual social excommunication?
('71', 27, 6, 22, 58852) Why is it that no one ventures to question the priestly oppression, this draining away annually the wealth of the people without any service whatever?
('71', 27, 7, 23, 59003) It is exploitation by religious heads that has crushed the people,
('71', 27, 8, 24, 59070) and the money lender and the State combined have finished the process.
('71', 27, 9, 25, 59141) not more work and harder work, and the variety of cottage industries that
('71', 27, 10, 26, 59215) thesehalf dead half living masses require, but more vocational schools and
('71', 27, 11, 27, 59290) dispensaries, maternity and child welfare centres and better food.
('71', 27, 12, 28, 59357) State is not moved very easily by your Herculean endeavours, Hinduism

('71', 28, 1, 2, 59506) requires a far more drastic purge as it has been established some thousands of
('71', 28, 2, 3, 59585) years longer than this alien Government.
('71', 28, 3, 4, 59626) Bishops and priests of the Christian religion, in spite of the fierce criticism levelled against them in this land and every other country, render humanitarian service unequalled by any other class of human beings who follow any other faith or no faith, and are approachable to all people.
('71', 28, 3, 5, 59916) It is good to see ourselves as others see us.
('71', 28, 3, 6, 59962) Try as we may, we are never able to know ourselves fully as we are, especially the evil side of us.
('71', 28, 3, 7, 60062) This we can do only if we are not angry with our critics but will take in good part whatever they might have to say.
('71', 28, 3, 8, 60179) Anyway, I propose to examine the foregoing criticism as dispassionately as I can.
('71', 28, 3, 9, 60261) The grave limitations of Hinduism as it is seen today in practice must be admitted.
('71', 28, 3, 10, 60345) Many mutts and their administration are undoubtedly a disgrace to Hinduism.
('71', 28, 3, 11, 60421) The money that is poured into some of them does not return to the worshippers in the form of service.
('71', 28, 3, 12, 60523) This state of things must be ended or mended.
('71', 28, 3, 13, 60569) Humanitarian work done by Christian missions must also be admitted.
('71', 28, 3, 14, 60637) But these admissions of mine must not be interpreted to mean endorsement of the deductions of the writer.
('71', 28, 3, 15, 60743) Economic and educational relief is required by most poor Indians in common with Harijans.
('71', 28, 3, 16, 60833) But the latter suffer from special disabilities.
('71', 28, 3, 17, 60882) It is not a question of what disabilities they resent.
('71', 28, 3, 18, 60937) It is the duty of the so called superior Hindus to break the chains that bind the Harijans even though they may hug them.The admission by the writer of the sublimity of Hinduism as expounded by Vivekanand and Radhakrishanan should have led to his discovery of its percolation down to the masses.
('71', 28, 3, 19, 61233) I make bold to say that in spite of the crudeness which one sees among the villagers, class considered, in all that is good in human nature they compare favourably with any villagers in the world.
('71', 28, 3, 20, 61430) This testimony is borne out by the majority of travellers who from the times of Huen Tsang down to the present times have recorded their impressions.
('71', 28, 3, 21, 61580) The innate culture that the villagers of India show, the art which one sees in the homes of the poor, the restraint with which the villagers conduct themselves, are surely due to the religion that has bound them together from time immemorial.
('71', 28, 3, 22, 61823) In his zeal to belittle Hinduism, the writer ignores the broad fact that Hinduism has produced a race of reformers who have successfully combated prejudices, superstitions and abuses.
('71', 28, 3, 23, 62007) Without any drum beating Hinduism has devised a system of relief of the poor which has been the envy of many foreign admirers.
('71', 28, 3, 24, 62134) I myself feel that
('71', 29, 0, 1, 62153) 30 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 29, 1, 2, 62194) it leaves much to be desired.
('71', 29, 1, 3, 62224) It has its evil side.
('71', 29, 1, 4, 62246) But from the philanthropic standpoint it has wholly justified itself.
('71', 29, 1, 5, 62316) It is not the Indian habit to advertise charities through printed reports and the like.
('71', 29, 1, 6, 62404) But he who runs may see the free kitchens and free medical relief given along indigenous lines.
('71', 29, 1, 7, 62500) The writer belittles village work.
('71', 29, 1, 8, 62535) It betrays gross ignorance.
('71', 29, 1, 9, 62563) If the mutts and the revenue offices were extinguished and free schools were opened, the people would not be cured of their inertia.
('71', 29, 1, 10, 62696) Mutts must be reformed, the revenue system must be overhauled, free primary schools must be established in every village.
('71', 29, 1, 11, 62818) But starvation will not disappear because people pay no revenue and mutts are destroyed and schools spring up in every village.
('71', 29, 1, 12, 62946) The greatest education in the villages consists in the villagers being taught or induced to work methodically and profitably all the year round whether it be on the land or at industries connected with the villages.
('71', 29, 1, 13, 63162) Lastly, my correspondent seems to resent acceptance by us of humanitarian services by missionaries.
('71', 29, 1, 14, 63262) Will he have an agitation led against these missionary institutions?
('71', 29, 1, 15, 63331) Why should they have non Christian aid?
('71', 29, 1, 16, 63371) They are established with the view of weaning Indians from their ancestral faith even as expounded by Vivekanand and Radhakrishnan.
('71', 29, 1, 17, 63503) Let them isolate the institutions from the double purpose.
('71', 29, 1, 18, 63562) It will be time enough then to expect non Christian aid.
('71', 29, 1, 19, 63619) The critic must be aware of the fact that even as it is some of these institutions do get non Christian aid.
('71', 29, 1, 20, 63728) My point is that there should be no complaint if they do not receive such aid so long as they have an aim which is repugnant to the non Christian sentiment.

('71', 29, 4, 24, 63959) AMTUL SALAAM, I got your letter today, Saturday.
('71', 29, 4, 25, 64008) You seem to have reached there quite in time.
('71', 29, 4, 26, 64054) Amtul 1 was saved miraculously .
('71', 29, 4, 27, 64087) 2 You have asked me to suggest a name for the girl.
('71', 29, 4, 28, 64139) But what do I know about that.
('71', 29, 4, 29, 64170) I can only think of Amina or Fatima.

('71', 30, 1, 3, 64383) It is for you, therefore, to choose the name.
('71', 30, 1, 4, 64429) You have suggested that I should write to Amtul, but you have not given me even her full name.
('71', 30, 1, 5, 64524) Please, therefore, show the following to her.
('71', 30, 1, 6, 64570) I congratulate you on both you and your daughter having been saved by God.
('71', 30, 1, 7, 64645) But Amtul Salaam tells me that you had wanted a boy.
('71', 30, 1, 8, 64698) I know that many women have such a wish.
('71', 30, 1, 9, 64739) But it is not a proper wish.
('71', 30, 1, 10, 64768) Why should we give so much importance to whether it is a boy or a girl?
('71', 30, 1, 11, 64840) We should be happy with whatever God sends us.
('71', 30, 1, 12, 64887) May God give you both a long life.
('71', 30, 1, 13, 64922) You may certainly write to Maulana Saheb 1 whatever you wish and obtain any fatwa that you like.
('71', 30, 1, 14, 65019) I only wish to see you at peace with yourself anyhow.
('71', 30, 1, 15, 65073) I have had a talk with Kanu.
('71', 30, 1, 16, 65102) He says that he had no wish whatever to give up his present work.
('71', 30, 1, 17, 65168) If he had not been engrossed in the Ramayana work, he would have liked to do khadi work with you.
('71', 30, 1, 18, 65266) But he feels that he would be violating his pledge if he gave up the work to which he has dedicated himself.
('71', 30, 1, 19, 65375) If, therefore, you want Kanus help in khadi work, you can have it only in Wardha.
('71', 30, 1, 20, 65457) Now that you have got work of your liking there, your health must improve.
('71', 30, 1, 21, 65532) But you are bound to continue to be ill so long as your mind is not at peace.

('71', 31, 4, 6, 66424) 32. HOW TO BEGIN 2
('71', 31, 5, 7, 66443) My invitation in these columns some time back to such khadi workers as may be anxious to become adepts in the various processes relating to the production of Khadi, 3 has evoked a wide reponse and I have already received several communications on the subject.
('71', 31, 5, 8, 66703) The object of the following remarks is to set forth a few practical hints for the guidance of these friends.
('71', 31, 5, 9, 66812) The first essential condition for anyone who wants to become master of any subject is to have a living faith in it.
('71', 31, 5, 10, 66928) He must next have the eagerness to learn and readiness to make the necessary sacrifice for its sake.
('71', 31, 5, 11, 67029) Books, teachers and other accessories of education are of course necessary in a more or less degree, but passion for knowledge and eagerness to learn are the most essential of all.
('71', 31, 5, 12, 67210) Given these, the other things will follow of themselves.
('71', 31, 5, 13, 67267) I would therefore suggestto these intending students of the khadi science that they can at once make a begining by finiding out what processes relative to khadi production are being carried out in their immediate neighbourhood and picking up all the useful information with regard to them available there.
('71', 31, 5, 14, 67573) The main task that faces a student of the khadi science today is collation and co ordination of personal experience.
('71', 31, 5, 15, 67690) A number of different processes relating to the production of khadi are today in vogue in different parts of the country.
('71', 31, 5, 16, 67812) But there is no single person today who fully knows all of them.
('71', 31, 5, 17, 67877) And yet complete, detailed knowledge of all these different processes is necessary before the science of khadi can be developed.
('71', 31, 5, 18, 68006) The task is obviously beyond the compass of a single individual.
('71', 31, 5, 19, 68071) But if there are a number of persons

('71', 32, 0, 1, 68311) VOL.71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 33
('71', 32, 1, 2, 68353) who are truly fired by a scientific spirit of research and they apply themselves to the task in a systematic manner, they will, by pooling their talents and experience, be able to evolve a living, growing science of khadi in a short time.
('71', 32, 1, 3, 68592) But before they can do that, they will need to have themselves collectively mastered all the processes of khadi production that are in vogue in the country today.
('71', 32, 1, 4, 68755) To take a concrete instance, several varieties of khadi are produced in different parts of Andhra today, employing different methods of carding.
('71', 32, 1, 5, 68900) Now any khadi worker in Andhra who is anxious to acquire the science of khadi can begin by mastering all these various methods.
('71', 32, 1, 6, 69028) For this he need not quit his province.
('71', 32, 1, 7, 69068) Let him by way of a start pick up the process which is current in his immediate neighbourhood.
('71', 32, 1, 8, 69163) A scientific study of carding would, of course, include a knowledge of the construction of the carding bow on the part of the student.
('71', 32, 1, 9, 69298) He would further need to know the materials from which the gut string and other component parts of a carding bow are made and how; what exactly the length of a carding bow should be in order to yield the best results, and the effects of departure from the standard length; where precisely the stroke on the bow string should be delivered and the reason why, and so on in respect of a host of other questions about which even the best of our professional carders today know little and care even less.
('71', 32, 1, 10, 69798) Similarly, with regard to cotton a worker who takes up a study of carding as a science would need to know all about the different varieties of cotton; the length, strength and fineness of their respective fibres, the various processes through which it has to pass before it reaches his hands; where it is grown; what is the yield per acre and the total money value of the crop; what is the extent of the area under cotton; what was the crop grown there previously which has been displaced, or was the area under question lying fallow before; what difference it would make to the cultivator if another crop were substituted in place of cotton; etc.
('71', 32, 1, 11, 70446) Thus his practical experience will be illumined by scientific knowledge and give him such a firm grip of his subject and an insight into its intricacies that to master the other processes of carding prevailing in different parts of Andhra will become comparatively an easy thing for him and take but little time.
('71', 32, 1, 12, 70759) If, further, he keeps regular notes of his experiments and experiences, they will in time take the place of an authoritative treatise on the science of carding.
('71', 32, 1, 13, 70920) It will be thus seen that no khadi worker need leave his field of work in order to learn the science of khadi.
('71', 32, 1, 14, 71031) If he is fired by the spirit
('71', 33, 0, 1, 71060) 34 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 33, 1, 2, 71101) of inquiry and has patience and capacity for concentrated application in a sufficient measure, he will , by applying himself to an intensive study of the processes for which his neighbourhood offers special facilities, not only become a specialist in those particular processes but also gradually widen the scope of his knowledge so as to deserve the name science.

('71', 34, 6, 14, 73012) MY DEAR REBEL, I have an excuse for writing to you.
('71', 34, 6, 15, 73064) You have left a small blue bottle.
('71', 34, 6, 16, 73099) It contains a white powder resembling epsom salt.
('71', 34, 6, 17, 73149) What is it?
('71', 34, 6, 18, 73161) I do hope you had no trouble in the train.
('71', 34, 6, 19, 73204) The moral is no onion, no sweet potatoes, a fair quanity of garlic.
('71', 34, 6, 20, 73272) Bowels ought no to be loose.
('71', 34, 6, 21, 73301) Hip and friction sitz baths and garlic ought to set the bowels right and eradicate eczema.
('71', 34, 6, 22, 73392) You must take at least 3 lb.
('71', 34, 6, 23, 73421) of milk per day.
('71', 34, 6, 24, 73438) Try unboiled fresh milk twice a day.
('71', 34, 6, 25, 73475) It must be taken whilst it is yet warm from the udder.
('71', 34, 6, 26, 73530) Your place is vacant and looks dismal.
('71', 34, 6, 27, 73569) Fancy doing without ones Secretary ever at your side!
('71', 34, 6, 28, 73623) But such is life, everything fleeting, only God is, nothing else is.
('71', 34, 7, 29, 73692) I have written it breaking up the sandhi.
('71', 34, 7, 30, 73734) BAPU [PS.] Forgot to give you Hindi Anasaktiyoga.

('71', 35, 2, 4, 74039) Why have you given no description of the journey?
('71', 35, 2, 5, 74089) If you dont worry, your health is bound to remain good.
('71', 35, 2, 6, 74145) Take hip baths.
('71', 35, 2, 7, 74161) Eat garlic.
('71', 35, 2, 8, 74173) Procure fresh milk.
('71', 35, 2, 9, 74193) Take ghee and butter in sufficient quantity.
('71', 35, 2, 10, 74238) And eat whatever fruit you can get.
('71', 35, 2, 11, 74274) Rajkumari left this morning.
('71', 35, 2, 12, 74303) She was reluctant to go.
('71', 35, 2, 13, 74328) She will stay for four days in Delhi.
('71', 35, 2, 14, 74366) Amtul Salaam has gone to Indore.
('71', 35, 2, 15, 74399) She left on Tuesday.
('71', 35, 2, 16, 74420) The house has becomes empty now.
('71', 35, 2, 17, 74453) Khan Saheb also is not here.
('71', 35, 2, 18, 74482) And there is plenty of milk.
('71', 35, 2, 19, 74511) Everybody is fine.
('71', 35, 2, 20, 74530) Bhansali is still in hospital.
('71', 35, 2, 21, 74561) He is better now.

('71', 35, 7, 26, 74699) BHAI VIYOGI HARI, Anasaktiyoga in Hindi should be available at the Sasta Sahitya Mandal.
('71', 35, 7, 27, 74788) If it is available there or anywhere else, do arrange to send a copy of it to Rajkumari Amrit Kaur, care of Mr. Fielden, 4, Bhagwandas Road, New Delhi.

('71', 35, 11, 33, 75113) It would be best to write immediately about things I ought to know.
('71', 35, 11, 34, 75181) I will leave here for Delhi on Sunday.
('71', 35, 11, 35, 75220) I dont think I shall have much time to talk with Devdas.
('71', 35, 11, 36, 75277) The whole day I shall be busy meeting people.You can certainly study in Mysore also.
('71', 35, 11, 37, 75362) The climate is undoubtedly good and Mysore has a university of its own.

('71', 36, 8, 10, 75775) If you have read the appeal 3 and you do not agree with the Bishops reading, you should pass on to him your own interpretation.

('71', 36, 13, 16, 76036) MY DEAR TILAKAM,
('71', 36, 14, 17, 76053) I was glad to hear from you at last.
('71', 36, 14, 18, 76090) Whatever others do or do not do, we do believe in ahimsa and have to persevere in the sure hope that it will triumph in the end.
('71', 36, 14, 19, 76219) Mathuradas Trikumji will certainly see you and properly guide you also.
('71', 36, 14, 20, 76291) You do not need any other introduction to him beyond this letter.
('71', 36, 14, 21, 76357) You can tell him that you were with me at Kingsley Hall in London, that you were in the Sabarmati for some time and that you are still in touch with me.

('71', 37, 5, 12, 76963) AMTUL SALAAM, I got your letter.
('71', 37, 5, 13, 76996) I am replying to it as soon as I got it.
('71', 37, 5, 14, 77037) I will reach Delhi on the 15th and will have to stay there, it seems, up to the 18th.
('71', 37, 5, 15, 77123) Perhaps it may be a day longer.
('71', 37, 5, 16, 77155) Yes, you are right in believing that you need not go to Rajkot now.
('71', 37, 5, 17, 77223) Pilani is far away from Delhi and is not on the way to Delhi either.
('71', 37, 5, 18, 77292) But you can certainly go there whenever you wish to.
('71', 37, 5, 19, 77345) You yourself had written to me saying that you wished to ask for a fatwa from Maulana Saheb.
('71', 37, 5, 20, 77438) I was very glad to learn that Amtul keeps good health.
('71', 37, 5, 21, 77493) The stiches also must have been removed now, and the baby must be fine, too.
('71', 37, 5, 22, 77570) Rajkumari also has left, and so we are very few here now.
('71', 37, 5, 23, 77628) Harjivan also left today.

('71', 37, 8, 27, 77780) NARANADAS, You of course read what I have been writing about khadi these days.
('71', 37, 8, 28, 77859) And you have also read Maganlals book 1. Will you, taking that book as your guide or according to any other plan you like, write

('71', 38, 0, 1, 78012) VOL.71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 39
('71', 38, 1, 2, 78054) something on the science of khadi?
('71', 38, 1, 3, 78089) For a historical account, you will need literature on the subject.
('71', 38, 1, 4, 78156) If you dont have it or have no time to read it, please see if you can write a book giving an account of the work being done now and giving information about all the processes from cotton onwards.
('71', 38, 1, 5, 78352) You must have read my questionnaire and Lakshmidass article.
('71', 38, 1, 6, 78413) We must have a book giving all that information.
('71', 38, 1, 7, 78462) Kamu writes that she has now started going to school.
('71', 38, 1, 8, 78516) I read your printed programme.
('71', 38, 1, 9, 78547) I didnt like it as well as I did your statement.
('71', 38, 1, 10, 78596) The portion in dialogue form is certainly excellent, but it cant be said to have been artistically interwoven with the rest.
('71', 38, 1, 11, 78721) That, however, is a minor defect.
('71', 38, 1, 12, 78755) I notice spelling mistakes too.
('71', 38, 1, 13, 78787) The Vidyapith dictionary is an authority for us.
('71', 38, 1, 14, 78836) I dont know if it contains the words peen, reeban, chipia, etc.
('71', 38, 1, 15, 78900) If it, you should look them up.
('71', 38, 1, 16, 78932) Now the dictionary does not at all give the word pin.
('71', 38, 1, 17, 78986) In English the vowel is short and we should spell the word accordingly.
('71', 38, 1, 18, 79058) I went through the rules about spelling and there also it is stated that words borrowed from foreign languages should be spelt in conformity with their spellings in those languages.
('71', 38, 1, 19, 79240) Moreover, the word peen has a definite meaning in Gujarati.
('71', 38, 1, 20, 79300) The dictionary explains it as thick, wellfed, rounded.
('71', 38, 1, 21, 79355) At first sight I didnt get the meaning of peen, but I made it out as I proceeded further.
('71', 38, 1, 22, 79445) In the dialogue you have spelt the word as cheepeeo.
('71', 38, 1, 23, 79498) It should be cheepio.
('71', 38, 1, 24, 79520) It is followed in the same sentence by reeban 1. In English the word is pronounced asriban and that is how it should be spelt according to the rule given in the dictionary.
('71', 38, 1, 25, 79693) The word is not given in the dictionary, though there is no harm in using it all the same.
('71', 38, 1, 26, 79784) You will find many more of similar other spelling mistakes.
('71', 38, 1, 27, 79844) I see no poetry in the bhajan or song He is the witless man.
('71', 38, 1, 28, 79905) The language jars on the ear and the thought also is none too pleasant.
('71', 38, 1, 29, 79977) The very first syllable augurs ill.
('71', 38, 1, 30, 80013) There is no such word as murakh.
('71', 38, 1, 31, 80046) The word is moorakh.
('71', 38, 1, 32, 80067) The thought in the line feeds the foreigner lovingly is indicative of ill will.
('71', 38, 1, 33, 80147) It does not befit a follower of non violence.
('71', 38, 1, 34, 80193) And if a foreigner is hungry, why should not one feed him lovingly?
('71', 38, 1, 35, 80261) Of course the meaning in the authors mind is different, but the reader is not concerned with the meaning in an authers mind if it is not expressed in his language.
('71', 38, 1, 36, 80425) In the phrase, deshana dukkhne tane, the syllable na, should be nasalized.
('71', 38, 1, 37, 80500) The expression to serve the stones of unemployment lacks moderation.
('71', 38, 1, 38, 80569) The metaphor also is not happy.
('71', 38, 1, 39, 80601) The thought in The fine noose of
('71', 38, 2, 40, 80634) 1 Ribbon
('71', 39, 0, 1, 80643) 40 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 39, 1, 2, 80684) the craze for fancifulness is touched with bitterness.
('71', 39, 1, 3, 80739) A noose cannot be discribed as fine, nor can it be said that the word fine has been used ironically.
('71', 39, 1, 4, 80840) The word greeva is not in keeping with the authors attempt to use rustic language.
('71', 39, 1, 5, 80923) The spelling januni is incorrect.
('71', 39, 1, 6, 80957) The word is janani.
('71', 39, 1, 7, 80977) But I will not go on with this criticism.
('71', 39, 1, 8, 81019) Go through the second part from this point of view.
('71', 39, 1, 9, 81071) I felt the whole poem crabbed and unpleasant.
('71', 39, 1, 10, 81117) The other song also didnt interest me.
('71', 39, 1, 11, 81156) I have not read it carefully, though.
('71', 39, 1, 12, 81194) But Vidhatara did catch my eye.
('71', 39, 1, 13, 81226) Nanavati suggests that it must have been a misprint.
('71', 39, 1, 14, 81279) The author must have written Vidhatra.
('71', 39, 1, 15, 81318) If that is correct, please note that the dictionary gives no word like Vidhatra.
('71', 39, 1, 16, 81399) It gives Vidhata and Vidhatri.
('71', 39, 1, 17, 81430) A poet has no right to alter spellings of words without sufficient reason.

('71', 39, 9, 33, 82110) MAMA, It is very strange that you saw anger in my letter 1. Maybe mere admonition is considered anger, but if no admonition is given there is also the fear that a person may not wake up.

('71', 40, 1, 3, 82530) I know this also, that it is an aspect of ahimsa.
('71', 40, 1, 4, 82580) If I saw the letter written to you I would certainly be able to know whether there was ahimsa or only himsa in it.
('71', 40, 1, 5, 82695) I do not know Vinobas and Kishorelals views.
('71', 40, 1, 6, 82740) I have certainly not met them.
('71', 40, 1, 7, 82771) I do not remember to have sent a copy of my letter to them.
('71', 40, 1, 8, 82831) Be that as it may, even after reading Raijis letter, I stick to my views.
('71', 40, 1, 9, 82905) I believe that one should not yield to the temptation of solving a problem.

('71', 40, 5, 15, 83177) March 12, 1937
('71', 40, 6, 16, 83192) BHAI RAIJI, I got your letter.
('71', 40, 6, 17, 83223) It was good that you wrote.
('71', 40, 6, 18, 83251) I could not agree with your argument.
('71', 40, 6, 19, 83289) The idea of serving many aims in planning the construction of temples does not appeal to me.
('71', 40, 6, 20, 83382) In my opinion, good lies in implementing all these ideas gradually.
('71', 40, 6, 21, 83450) How can a person whom we would not like to keep in our house be permitted to stay in a temple?
('71', 40, 6, 22, 83545) A temple should never be allowed to be a shelter for vagabonds.
('71', 40, 6, 23, 83609) Only holy men are a worthy sight in a temple compound.
('71', 40, 6, 24, 83664) If you brothers cherish the idea of making the temple Gods abode, then it is desirable that you do not transform it into a place of self seeking.
('71', 40, 6, 25, 83810) If your ideas are carried out, God will suffocate in that place although it may be called a temple.
('71', 40, 6, 26, 83910) I would personally wish that you should never copy the failings of the Hindus who consider themselves as belonging to the upper castes.
('71', 40, 6, 27, 84046) I may remind you that Bhangi friends twice took an oath before me that they would give up drinking and twice broke it.
('71', 40, 6, 28, 84165) But I too am made of ordinary clay as you are.
('71', 40, 6, 29, 84212) So we need not put a high value on the knowledge that you may be able to gain from me, but, if you desire to make the temple a true abode of God, then do not make it a shelter for persons of doubtful worth and a place for storing utensils of use to the community.

('71', 41, 1, 2, 84618) installed inside a pledge to abjure drink, and cling to it; then although the temple may have taken only Rs. 5 to build instead of Rs. 5,000, it will still become a shrine of pilgrimage.
('71', 41, 1, 3, 84805) I should like the place where Mama stays to be such a holy place, and a temple like that cannot be built by spending money.

('71', 41, 5, 7, 85032) 47. THE COW
('71', 41, 6, 8, 85044) The cow is an object of worship and veneration to millions in India.
('71', 41, 6, 9, 85113) I count myself among them.
('71', 41, 6, 10, 85140) The cow shed in Segaon is in front of me.
('71', 41, 6, 11, 85182) I cannot escape its inmates even if I would.
('71', 41, 6, 12, 85227) And when I was arguing the question of the masses of Harijans with Christian friends, I said, The majority of Harijans can no more understand the presentation of Christianity than my cows. This comparision shocked my friends so much that the shock has travelled to America and I have begun to receive letters from America telling me how my comparision is being used to discredit me and my claim to serve Harijans.
('71', 41, 6, 13, 85641) The critics seem to say, You can have little regard for Harijans if you compare them to the cow. Nevertheless I am unrepentant.
('71', 41, 6, 14, 85769) My American credit will be little worth if it can be demolished on the very first shock however trivial it might be.
('71', 41, 6, 15, 85886) But I hold that my comparison was as innocuous as it was appropriate.
('71', 41, 6, 16, 85956) It was innocuous because of the unique place the cow occupies in India.
('71', 41, 6, 17, 86028) It was appropriate because in the matter of understanding the presentation of Christianity the ordinary Harijan can no more take it in than the cow.
('71', 41, 6, 18, 86177) That the dullest Harijan can be trained to understand it in course of time, whereas the cow never can, is irrelevant for the simple reason that the discussion related to the present condition, not to future possibility.
('71', 41, 6, 19, 86397) My point would be better understood if I extend the comparision and say that my five year old grandson or my sixty eight year old wife can no more understand the presentation than my cow, though both my wife and my grandson are objects of tender care and attention.
('71', 41, 6, 20, 86663) I could say of myself that I can no more read the Chinese alphabet today than my worshipful cow.
('71', 42, 0, 1, 86760) VOL.71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 43
('71', 42, 1, 2, 86802) The truth of this last statement is not in any way altered by the fact that if someone began to teach my cow and me the difficult alphabet, I should beat the cow hollow, if the poor venerable mother ever consented to enter the competition.
('71', 42, 1, 3, 87042) Let my critics and credulous friends understand that apart from the comparison, I stand on unassailable ground when I assert that it is a travesty of religion to seek to uproot from the Harijans simple minds such faith as they have in their ancestral religion and to transfer their allegiance to another, even though that other may be as good as and equal to the original in quality.
('71', 42, 1, 4, 87426) Though all soils have the same predominantcharaterstics, we know that the same seeds do not fare equally well in all soils.
('71', 42, 1, 5, 87550) I have some excellent tree cotton seeds which thrive excellently in certain parts of Bengal.
('71', 42, 1, 6, 87643) But Mirabehn has not succeeded as yet in getting the same result from the same seeds in the Varoda soil.
('71', 42, 1, 7, 87748) But I should be unable to subscribe to the formula, if the attempt was made to advance it, that the Varoda soil is inferior to the Bengal soil.
('71', 42, 1, 8, 87892) But my fear is that though Christian friends nowadays do not say or admit that Hindu religion is untrue, they must harbour in their breasts the belief that Hinduism is an error and that Christianity as they believe it is the only true religion.
('71', 42, 1, 9, 88137) Without some such thing it is not possible to understand, much less to appreciate, the C.M.S. appeal from which I reproduced in these columns some revealing extracts the other day.
('71', 42, 1, 10, 88318) 1 One could understand the attack on untouchability and many other errors that have crept into Hindu life.
('71', 42, 1, 11, 88425) And if they would help us to get rid of the admitted abuses and purify our religion, they would do helpful constructive work which would be gratefully accepted.
('71', 42, 1, 12, 88586) But so far as one can understand the present effort, it is to uproot Hinduism from the very foundation and replace it by another faith.
('71', 42, 1, 13, 88722) It is like an attempt to destroy a house which though badly in want of repair appears to the dweller quite decent and habitable.
('71', 42, 1, 14, 88851) No wonder he welcomes those who show him how to repair it and even offer to do so themselves.
('71', 42, 1, 15, 88945) But he would most decidedly resist those who sought to destroy the house that had served well him and his ancestors for ages, unless he, the dweller, was convinced that the house was beyond repair and unfit for human habitation.
('71', 42, 1, 16, 89174) If the Christian world entertains that opinion about the Hindu house, Parliament of Religions and International Fellowship are empty phrases.
('71', 42, 1, 17, 89316) For both the terms presuppose

('71', 43, 1, 2, 89424) equality of status, a common platform.
('71', 43, 1, 3, 89463) There cannot be a common platform as between inferiors and superiors, or the enlightened and the unenlightened, the regenerate and the unregenerate, the high born and the low born, the caste man and the outcaste.
('71', 43, 1, 4, 89676) My comparison may be defective, may even sound offensive.
('71', 43, 1, 5, 89734) My reasoning may be unsound.
('71', 43, 1, 6, 89763) But my proposition stands.

('71', 43, 2, 8, 89809) 48. ANDREWS ON TRAVANCORE
('71', 43, 3, 9, 89835) Deenbandhu Andrews writes:
('71', 43, 4, 10, 89862) The arrival of each new number of Harijan is one of the exciting events
('71', 43, 5, 11, 89934) of the week in my old college rooms at Cambridge, where I have been busy
('71', 43, 6, 12, 90007) lecturing this term: but this morning the paper exceeded my highest
('71', 43, 7, 13, 90075) expectation.
('71', 43, 7, 14, 90088) For it told me of the wonderful visit to Travancore, and the joy of
('71', 43, 8, 15, 90156) the Harijans as they entered the temples freely to meet you and take part in the
('71', 43, 9, 16, 90237) prayers which you conducted within the temple walls.
('71', 43, 9, 17, 90290) Many years ago, I had
('71', 43, 10, 18, 90312) gone down into Travancore at your requestboth to Vaikom, where I
('71', 43, 11, 19, 90377) witnessed the great Satyagraha struggle, and also to Kottayam.
('71', 43, 11, 20, 90440) Outside Kottayam, in the country district, multitudes of the avarnas had come to meet
('71', 43, 12, 21, 90526) me and to receive your message.
('71', 43, 12, 22, 90558) At one place, nearly two thousand had
('71', 43, 13, 23, 90596) collected.
('71', 43, 13, 24, 90607) Their misery and suffering haunted me afterwards and I could not
('71', 43, 14, 25, 90672) think of anything else.
('71', 43, 14, 26, 90696) Again, at Vaikom where I stayed with the Satyagrahis,
('71', 43, 15, 27, 90750) I saw once more the misery and suffering of those who were prevented from
('71', 43, 16, 28, 90824) going on the road outside the temple.
('71', 43, 16, 29, 90862) On that occasion, I went and pleaded
('71', 43, 17, 30, 90899) with the Nambudiri Brahmins, but in vain.
('71', 43, 17, 31, 90941) Now it was wonderful beyond
('71', 43, 18, 32, 90969) measure to read how that old Satyagraha struggle, with all its bravery and
('71', 43, 19, 33, 91044) endurance, had at last found its completion!
('71', 43, 19, 34, 91089) For not merely the roads but the temple itself had been entered by the savarnas and avarnas together!
('71', 43, 20, 35, 91191) now long to hear is this, that some at least of Nambudiri Brahmins, who have
('71', 43, 21, 36, 91268) so truly sought to undo the harm done in the past, may also be led to offer to
('71', 43, 22, 37, 91347) these Harijans, whom they have thus welcomed as brothers, a brotherly wage
('71', 43, 23, 38, 91422) for the full work which they perform.
('71', 43, 23, 39, 91460) Only in that brotherly way can the
('71', 43, 24, 40, 91495) victory become complete.
('71', 43, 24, 41, 91520) From all I hear, the Proclamation is being worked so effectively that the economic salvation which Deenbandhu wants to hear of is bound to come and that sooner than one may expect.
('71', 43, 24, 42, 91701) For, addressing a meeting of Pulayas, Pariahs and others on the Ist instant at

('71', 44, 1, 2, 91822) Trivandrum, the Dewan Sir C.P. Ramaswami Aiyar is reported to have said:
('71', 44, 2, 3, 91895) The Maharaja regarded the Temple entry Proclamation not as an end in itself, but as the first step in the rehabilitation of the State.
('71', 44, 2, 4, 92030) What was needed was educational upliftment, economic upliftment and social integration.
('71', 44, 2, 5, 92118) For this, the co operation of the Ruler and the people was necessary.
('71', 44, 2, 6, 92188) Out of consi deration for the class of people who were being lifted up, it had been decided to omit the word depressed from Government documents and publications.
('71', 44, 2, 7, 92351) He ventured to say the time would come when the Depressed Classes would forget that name.

('71', 44, 4, 9, 92460) 49. MARRIED BRAHMACHARYA 1
('71', 44, 5, 10, 92487) A friend writes:
('71', 44, 6, 11, 92504) I have long since held with you that self control is the only sovereign method for attaining birth control.
('71', 44, 6, 12, 92612) That the sexual act is meant for procreation only, and apart from it, in any shape or form , would amount to unnatural gratification of lust, needs no proof.
('71', 44, 6, 13, 92770) But sometimes this brings one up against a grave dilemma.
('71', 44, 6, 14, 92828) Supposing that the sexual act, once or twice, fails to lead to conception, what is one to do then?
('71', 44, 6, 15, 92927) Where is one to draw the limit?
('71', 44, 6, 16, 92959) It is hard finally to give up all hope of begetting offspring.
('71', 44, 6, 17, 93022) On the other hand, unlimited indulgence in the sexual act must result in the man being drained of all vitality.
('71', 44, 6, 18, 93134) Again, should such a person be told to regard his failure to beget progeny on the first or the second chance, as a mark of adverse fate and on that score to abstain from having any further intercourse thereafter?
('71', 44, 6, 19, 93347) But that would require an exceptional degree of self possession and spiritual strength on the part of the person concerned.
('71', 44, 6, 20, 93471) Instances of people begetting progeny in their declining years after repeated failure during the years of manhood and youth are by no means either unknown or rare.
('71', 44, 6, 21, 93635) That makes the observance of complete abstinence still more difficult, and the position becomes further complicated when the parties happen to be otherwise healthy and free from any physical defect.
('71', 44, 6, 22, 93834) I admit the difficulty, but the difficulty is inherent in the problem itself.
('71', 44, 6, 23, 93912) The road to any progress is strewn with such difficulties and the story of mans ascent in the scale of evolution is co extensive with the history of the successful overcoming of these
('71', 44, 7, 24, 94096) 1 The Hindi original of this was published in Harijan Sevak, 13 3 1937. The translation is by Pyarelal.
('71', 45, 0, 1, 94200) 46 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 45, 1, 2, 94241) difficulties.
('71', 45, 1, 3, 94255) Take the story of the attempts to conquer the Himalayas.
('71', 45, 1, 4, 94312) The higher you go the steeper becomes the climb, the more difficult the ascent, so much so that its highest peak still remains unvanquished.The enterprise has already exacted a heavy toll of sacrifice.
('71', 45, 1, 5, 94514) Yet every year sees fresh attempts made only to end in failure like their predecessors.
('71', 45, 1, 6, 94602) All that has, however, failed to damp the spirit of the explorers.
('71', 45, 1, 7, 94669) If that is the case with the conquest of the Himalayas, what about the conquest of self, which is a harder job by far, even as the reward is richer?
('71', 45, 1, 8, 94818) The scaling of the the Himalayas can, at best, give a temporary feeling of elation and triumph.
('71', 45, 1, 9, 94914) But the reward of the conquest of self is a spiritual bliss that knows no waning and grows ever more and more.
('71', 45, 1, 10, 95025) It is a welll known maxim of the science of brahmacharya that insemination in the case of a man who has properly kept the rules of brahmacharya cannot, ought not to, fail to lead to conception.
('71', 45, 1, 11, 95219) And this is just as it should be.
('71', 45, 1, 12, 95253) When a man has completely conquered his animality, involuntary incontinence becomes impossible, and the desire for sexual gratification for its own sake ceases altogether.
('71', 45, 1, 13, 95425) Sexual union then takes place only when there is a desire for offspring.
('71', 45, 1, 14, 95498) This is the meaning of what has been described as married brahmacharya.
('71', 45, 1, 15, 95570) In other words, a person who obeys this rule, though leading a married life, attains the same state as, and is equal in merit to, one who completely abstains from the sexual act, which is only a means for procreation, never for self indulgence.
('71', 45, 1, 16, 95815) In practice, it is true, this ideal is seen to be rarely realized in its completeness.
('71', 45, 1, 17, 95902) But in shaping our ideals we cannot think in terms of our weaknesses or the possible lapses.
('71', 45, 1, 18, 95995) The present tendency, however, is to take a complete swing round, and the protagonists of contraceptives have almost set up self indulgence as their ideal.
('71', 45, 1, 19, 96151) Self indulgence obviously can never be an ideal.
('71', 45, 1, 20, 96200) There can be no limit to the practice of an ideal.
('71', 45, 1, 21, 96251) But unlimited self indulgence, as everybody would admit, can only result in certain destruction of the individual or the race concerned.
('71', 45, 1, 22, 96388) Hence self control alone can be our ideal, and it has been so regarded from the earliest times.
('71', 45, 1, 23, 96484) Therefore we have to explore the means of its attainment, not to circumvent it.
('71', 45, 1, 24, 96564) It has become my settled conviction that most of the difficulties that are experienced in connection with the practice of brahmacharya are due to our ignorance about its laws and would of themselves disappear if we discovered them.
('71', 45, 1, 25, 96796) Let us, for instance, examine the poser propounded by our correspondent in the ideal light.
('71', 45, 1, 26, 96888) In the ideal state, in the first place, such a contingency will never arise, because in a normally healthy couple, who have from their childhood upward observed the rules of brahmacharya, sexual union can never prove

('71', 46, 1, 2, 97147) infertile.
('71', 46, 1, 3, 97158) In practice, however, anomalies do arise.
('71', 46, 1, 4, 97200) The only rule that can be laid down in such instances is that coitus may be permittedonce at the end of the monthly period till conception is established.
('71', 46, 1, 5, 97355) If its object is achieved it must be adjured forthwith, for mere sensual gratification should never be its object.
('71', 46, 1, 6, 97470) It is my faith based on my experience that bodily and mental health increases in the same ratio as bodily and mental chastity.
('71', 46, 1, 7, 97597) Nor is it to be wondered at.
('71', 46, 1, 8, 97626) A substance that is capable of producing such a wounderful being as man, cannot but be transmuted into matchless energy and strength.
('71', 46, 1, 9, 97760) Anyone can test for himself the truth of this observation of the Shastras for himself by personal experience.
('71', 46, 1, 10, 97870) And the rule holds good in respect of woman no less than man.
('71', 46, 1, 11, 97932) The real difficulty, however, is that we vainly expect to be free from outward manifestations of lust, while harbouring it in our minds, with the result that physically and mentally we become utter wrecks, and our lives, in the words of the Gita become a living lie or hypocrisy personified.

('71', 47, 6, 10, 99080) BHAI PARIKSHITLAL, I got your letter.
('71', 47, 6, 11, 99118) The description of the Harijan school at Edarpura appears to be good but I refrain from publishing it.
('71', 47, 6, 12, 99221) There have been instances in the past when, after a favourable description about a school or an institution was received and published, our subsequent experience of it was bitter.
('71', 47, 6, 13, 99401) Either we do not have the courage to publish such experience or it seems improper to do so.
('71', 47, 6, 14, 99493) If, however, one occasionally comes across a description like the one you have given, one may derive what joy one can from it and then forget about it.
('71', 47, 6, 15, 99645) One would then be saved from the kind of embarrassing situation mentioned above.
('71', 47, 6, 16, 99726) If it is a really good school, it will surely go on progressing.
('71', 47, 6, 17, 99791) Such a school cares for no praise.
('71', 47, 6, 18, 99826) I have not seen many reasons to hope that because of our description of a school others will immediately copy its example.
('71', 47, 6, 19, 99949) However, I have not made it a rule in my mind that such descriptions should never be published.
('71', 47, 6, 20, 100045) Whenever, therefore, you feel it very necessary to publish a particular description, please write to me.

('71', 48, 10, 12, 100568) 170 It is difficult to say how far these figures are reliable.
('71', 48, 10, 13, 100631) But I think it may safely be assumed that if they err at all it is on the side of understatement.
('71', 48, 10, 14, 100729) The actual production of the handlooms is probably higher.
('71', 48, 10, 15, 100788) We ought to be able to convert all these handlooms to the use of hand spun yarn, but we are powerless to do that today.
('71', 48, 10, 16, 100908) Our charkha yarn today is neither of sufficient strength nor is it produced in sufficient quantity.
('71', 48, 10, 17, 101008) So long as we cannot produce hand spun yarn that will stand comparison with the mill yarn in strength and uninformity, the handloom weaver will refuse to handle it and for very good reason too.
('71', 48, 10, 18, 101202) In the first place, the employement of weak and uneven yarn reduces the quantity of cloth that he can turn out in a given time and thus affects his earning capacity.
('71', 48, 10, 19, 101368) Secondly, the handloom weaver today has specialized more or less in higher lines of production while our output of hand spun yarn of fine count is extremely meagre and that too is confined mostly to Andhra.
('71', 48, 10, 20, 101575) The solution of the difficulty involves a complete mastery of the khadi science.
('71', 48, 10, 21, 101656) But I am not asking anybody to tackle this problem today.
('71', 48, 10, 22, 101714) It can for the present wait.
('71', 48, 10, 23, 101743) There are a number of other problems whichwill have to be successfully tackled before we can cope with the question of the handloom.
('71', 48, 10, 24, 101876) Only let it be borne in mind that this

('71', 56, 7, 34, 112440) Cant you come to an understanding with Jayaprakash about that?
('71', 56, 7, 35, 112503) Doesnt he expect your help for some time?
('71', 56, 7, 36, 112545) That would of course be the proper course.

('71', 57, 7, 8, 112894) MY DEAR IDIOT, You want me to give you news.
('71', 57, 7, 9, 112939) But you have not armed me with your pen.
('71', 57, 7, 10, 112980) You can write away for hours and still find more to write.
('71', 57, 7, 11, 113039) I cant carry on for minutes, if I have to do mere chatting.
('71', 57, 7, 12, 113099) Here goes the morning prayer bell.
('71', 57, 7, 13, 113134) If you think that the first relevant portion of the London letter may be published, copy it and send.
('71', 57, 7, 14, 113236) Sardar Datar Singh met me day before yesterday and we talked about his dairy.
('71', 57, 7, 15, 113314) You should go and see it.
('71', 57, 7, 16, 113340) He has one in Lahore now.
('71', 57, 7, 17, 113366) There is no likelihood of my seeing the Governor General.
('71', 57, 7, 18, 113424) I leave on Sunday, possibly tomorrow.
('71', 57, 7, 19, 113462) All seems to have ended well at the A. I. C. C. But there have been little storms which have not made me quite happy 1. They make one think.
('71', 57, 7, 20, 113603) Mahadev returns today or rather tonight.
('71', 57, 7, 21, 113644) He had an hour with Subhas Chandra Bose, evidently after his release.
('71', 57, 7, 22, 113714) I am glad Mahadev went in time to greet him as a free man.
('71', 57, 7, 23, 113773) But who knows whether he is now free or he was freer when he was a prisoner.
('71', 57, 7, 24, 113850) Your description of the Manganwal village is very hopeful.
('71', 57, 7, 25, 113909) Of course everywhere the difficulty is about workers.
('71', 57, 7, 26, 113963) They have to be found or prepared locally.
('71', 57, 7, 27, 114006) Importation is not possible for nowhere is there a plethora of supply.
('71', 57, 7, 28, 114077) I have got to stop now for there are visitors surrounding me.

('71', 58, 2, 3, 114361) DELHI, March 19, 1937
('71', 58, 3, 4, 114383) Asked for his comments on the resolution 1 of the A. I. C. C., Gandhiji said: This is not now within my province.
('71', 58, 3, 5, 114497) I being now aloof from the day to day activities of the Congress, it is not for me to forecast how the resolution would work out in the actualities of provincial politics.
('71', 58, 3, 6, 114669) My interest at present is confined to that of tendering advice and assisting in drafting 2.
('71', 58, 4, 7, 114761) Denying very firmly any intention to make office acceptance virtually impossible, he said: The resolution is a downright honest resolution, without the slightest mental reservation but it must be read as an indivisible whole.
('71', 58, 4, 8, 114987) If Governors want Congressmen to take office, I can see nothing in the resolution to make it even awkward to them to give the fullest satisfaction to the Congress leaders in their representative Provinces this of course within the very limited sphere in which Provincial Governors have discretion and the resolution has asked for nothing more.
('71', 58, 4, 9, 115331) Any leader summoned by the Governor in terms of the Act to form his Cabinet will naturally use the Congress resolution by way of illustration and he will ask for an assurance in cases covered by the resolution.
('71', 58, 5, 10, 115542) Asked if he would indicate some of the details of the plan of work of Congress Ministries, Gandhiji said that that could be best done by those who were likely to be in office themselves.

('71', 58, 7, 13, 115783) Pyarelal has unearthed the following instructive extract on the suttee and widowhood from the treatise on universal histroy by Diodorus the Sicilian who lived in the age of Julius Caesar.
('71', 58, 8, 14, 115971) Now it was an ancient law among the Indians that when young men and maidens were minded to wed they did not marry according to the judgment of the parents, but by mutual consent.
('71', 58, 8, 15, 116150) But when espousals were made between

('71', 59, 1, 2, 116355) persons of immature age, mistakes of judgment were of frequent occurrence, and when both sides repented their union, many of the women became depraved, and through incontinence fell in love with other men, and when at last they wished to leave the husbands they had first chosen, but could not in decency do so openly, they got rid of them by poison, a means of destroying life which they could readily procure in their country which produces in great quantity and variety drugs of fatal potency, some of which cause death if merely introduced as powder into food and drink.
('71', 59, 1, 3, 116930) But when this nefarious practice had become quite prevalent, and many lives had been sacrificed, and when it was found that the punishment of the guilty had no effect in deterring other wives from their career of iniquity, they passed a law ordaining that a wife, unless she was pregnant or had already borne children, should be burned along with the deceased husband, and that if she did not choose to obey the law she sould remain a widow to the end of her life, and be for ever excomm unicated from the sacrifices and other solemnities as being an impious person.
('71', 59, 1, 4, 117497) If these extracts give a faithful account of the origin of the two inhuman customs, we have reason to thank Heavens for the suppression of the suttee by law imposed upon us.
('71', 59, 1, 5, 117671) No outside impo sition can cure Hindu society of the enforced widowhood of girls who dont even know what marriage is.
('71', 59, 1, 6, 117789) The reform can come first by the force of enlightened public opinion among Hindus, secondly by parents recognizing the duty of marrying their girl widows.
('71', 59, 1, 7, 117944) This they can do, where the girls consent is lacking, by educating their minds to the correctness of their marrying.
('71', 59, 1, 8, 118061) Naturally this refers to girls under age.
('71', 59, 1, 9, 118103) Where the so called widows have grown to maturity and they do not desire to marry, nothing is necessary save to tell them that they are free to marry precisely as if they were maidens unmarried.
('71', 59, 1, 10, 118298) It is difficult to break the chains of prisoners who hug them, mis taking them as ornaments, as girls and even grown up women do regard their silver or golden chains and rings as ornaments.

('71', 59, 2, 12, 118507) 71. AN ILLUSION
('71', 59, 3, 13, 118523) I received this letter 1 last November.
('71', 59, 3, 14, 118563) But owing to pressure of work I could not write anything up till now.
('71', 59, 3, 15, 118633) The writer is a scholar of
('71', 59, 4, 16, 118660) 1 Not translated here.
('71', 59, 4, 17, 118683) The correspondent had said that caste Hindus ill treated Harijans because they were poor and suggested that unless their economic conditions were improved, anti untouchability activities would bear no fruit.
('71', 60, 0, 1, 118891) VOL.71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1935 61
('71', 60, 1, 2, 118933) Lahore.
('71', 60, 1, 3, 118941) It is surprising that he should be labouring under such a grave misapprehension.
('71', 60, 1, 4, 119022) Perhaps the recent miracle of Travancore has removed his misapprehension.
('71', 60, 1, 5, 119096) Still there are many people who harbour such misconceptions.
('71', 60, 1, 6, 119157) So, it would be better to reply to his letter.
('71', 60, 1, 7, 119204) In Travancore the Harijans behind the strong movement for temple entry were not wanting in money.
('71', 60, 1, 8, 119302) Their leader was, and still is, Shri Govindan, an ex judge of Travancore.
('71', 60, 1, 9, 119376) Money brought them no peace.
('71', 60, 1, 10, 119405) Temple entry has brought them peace; we witness it for ourselves.
('71', 60, 1, 11, 119471) They are very pleased with the Maharaja and Maharani.
('71', 60, 1, 12, 119525) Even if the Maharaja had bestowed half his kingdom on them, it would not have achieved what temple entry has achieved.
('71', 60, 1, 13, 119644) This miracle shows that man values many things more than wealth.
('71', 60, 1, 14, 119709) Man sacrifices his all for self respect.
('71', 60, 1, 15, 119750) People have suffered many hardships in the cause of religion, and have even embraced death for it.
('71', 60, 1, 16, 119849) When Hindus observe untouchability towards non Hindus, there is certainly hatred in it.
('71', 60, 1, 17, 119937) But as the non Hindus are strong, they do not feel it as much as the Harijans do, who in spite of belonging to the same religion are considered untouchables.
('71', 60, 1, 18, 120095) It is also not right to say that there are restrictions in the matter of eating and drinking even among the four castes.
('71', 60, 1, 19, 120216) The difference between this and untouchability is like that between an elephant and an ant.
('71', 60, 1, 20, 120308) Untouchables are outcastes.
('71', 60, 1, 21, 120336) However rich they may be, if they do anything outside their custom they are flogged.
('71', 60, 1, 22, 120421) It is my firm belief that Hindus alone are responsible for the grievances of the Harijans.
('71', 60, 1, 23, 120512) They have made injustice their dharma.
('71', 60, 1, 24, 120551) To describe their problem as an economic one is tantamount to denying their present situation.
('71', 60, 1, 25, 120646) From the way this correspondent writes it appears that though he is a Hindu, he keeps himself a little outside the Hindu society.
('71', 60, 1, 26, 120776) There are no Brahmins who are hated by Rajputs or any other caste Hindus.
('71', 60, 1, 27, 120850) On the other hand, we find that a Brahmin or any other caste Hindu is worshipped even by the rich if he embraces poverty.
('71', 60, 1, 28, 120972) In the end, even after having read the correspondents letter with due care and courtesy, I do not regret anything I have said or done regarding untouchability.

('71', 61, 8, 14, 122048) A national school was founded in Rajkot sixteen years ago chiefly through the efforts of the late Shri Revashankar Jagjivan Jhaveri and with the help of Shri Jamnadas Gandhi.
('71', 61, 8, 15, 122223) Last month, its sixteenth anniversary was celebrated under the chairmanship of Shri Narahari Parikh.
('71', 61, 8, 16, 122324) There are three sections in that schoolthe Vinay, the Kumar and the Bal Mandir.
('71', 61, 8, 17, 122404) In all, 190 students110 boys and 80 girlsare studying there.
('71', 61, 8, 18, 122465) I quote below a paragraph from Shri Narandas Gandhis statement 2that deserves attention.
('71', 61, 8, 19, 122554) It is a matter for rejoicing that interest can be created in this way in khadi amongst girls and boys.
('71', 61, 8, 20, 122657) It is significant to note that cotton too is grown in the school, that a dairy is run and foodstuff necessary

('71', 61, 9, 23, 123116) The statement amongst other things, explained that children at the Vidyalaya showed a keen interest in khadi.
('71', 61, 9, 24, 123226) The Vidyalay a conducted classes to teach sewing, weaving, farming and dairying, besides running a provision store.

('71', 62, 1, 2, 123384) for a balanced diet also prepared there.
('71', 62, 1, 3, 123425) If these activities are properly developed and the boys and girls are taught in the skills needed for them in a manner which they would understand, their minds would truly develop.
('71', 62, 1, 4, 123606) It is an illusion to believe that a childs intellect develops by cramming it with facts which have no relevance to his life.
('71', 62, 1, 5, 123731) These may well provide entertainment to the intellect, they cannot develop it, because their intellect will not be able to discriminate.
('71', 62, 1, 6, 123868) But whenever a boy or a girl has to perform some activity and that activity is not taught to him in a mechanical fashion but the reason behind each activity is explained, in such cases the childs intellect develops readily, he acquires self awareness, self respect and self reliance.

('71', 62, 4, 10, 124260) Question: It is all right that you teach us tailoring and high class shoe making.
('71', 62, 4, 11, 124342) But that is not what our villagers want.
('71', 62, 4, 12, 124383) We must learn something that our villagers need.
('71', 62, 4, 13, 124432) Answer: You are partly right and partly wrong.
('71', 62, 4, 14, 124479) The villagers may not need these things, but the city people need them.
('71', 62, 4, 15, 124551) Why should they not depend on you rather than others for these things?
('71', 62, 4, 16, 124622) If thereby a living contact can be established between the cities and the villages, it will be very good.
('71', 62, 4, 17, 124728) You have got to teach the villagers whatever you learn here.
('71', 62, 5, 18, 124789) Q. If we are to do tanning and scavenging which are the occupations of our
('71', 62, 6, 19, 124864) forefathers and which have kept us untouchables for centuries, how are you going to
('71', 62, 7, 20, 124948) destroy untouchability?
('71', 62, 8, 21, 124972) 1 This is extracted from Weekly Letter by Mahadev Desai, who had repo rted that Gandhiji spent half an hour with the inmates of the Harijan Industrial Home in Harijan Colony, where he was staying.
('71', 62, 8, 22, 125169) After some friendly talk with the boys they were invited to put questions.
('71', 62, 8, 23, 125244) Mahadev Desai had also explained that the Home, which had about 33 boys, imparted training in tailoring, shoe making and carpentry, in addition to teaching Hindi and arithmetic.
('71', 62, 8, 24, 125422) They lived a clean, healthy corporate life doing cooking, washing, sweeping, grinding, etc., by turns.
('71', 62, 8, 25, 125525) and scavenging of neighbouring villages every Sunday morning.

('71', 63, 1, 3, 125768) Dont you know that I am a master scavenger?
('71', 63, 1, 4, 125812) But nobody treats me as an untouchable.
('71', 63, 1, 5, 125852) Why should they then treat you as an untouchable?
('71', 63, 1, 6, 125902) And if they treated you as a touchable only after you give up professions which are so useful to the community, where is the merit?
('71', 63, 1, 7, 126034) Untouchability will not be removed that way.
('71', 63, 1, 8, 126079) For then they will treat as untouchables those who will next do these unclean tasks.
('71', 63, 1, 9, 126164) Untouchability cannot be destroyed that way.
('71', 63, 1, 10, 126209) It can be destroyed by the so called untouchables also doing the unclean tasks, and by impressing on the orthodox that however unclean those tasks, they are as honourable as any other and more useful than many.

('71', 63, 4, 14, 126531) With regard to the first question 2, Gandhiji said that he would give his attention to that.
('71', 63, 4, 15, 126624) Reverting to the second question 3 he said: There is no cause dearer to my life than the cause of Hindu Muslim unity and since.
('71', 63, 4, 16, 126752) I have taken up this cause I have staked my life on several occasions on this issue.
('71', 63, 4, 17, 126837) All those Muslim leaders who come in closer touch with me know that I have this object every moment in my eye and every minute a fire is kindling in my heart.
('71', 63, 5, 18, 126996) Mahatmaji, however, told the Jamiat leaders that he had been pondering over fresh avenues of real Hindu Muslim unity.
('71', 63, 5, 19, 127114) Mahatmaji thought that the present situation when the Congress has been returned in a majority in elections in most of the Provinces might help in this task.

('71', 63, 7, 22, 127540) They also suggested establishing a separate institution for creating a better understanding among the different communities of India on the lines of All India Spinners Association and Harijan Sevak Sangh.

('71', 64, 3, 5, 127865) Your love letters to hand.
('71', 64, 3, 6, 127892) I do not like your pain in the toe.
('71', 64, 3, 7, 127928) Why do you want dal or ghee in cooking vegetables?
('71', 64, 3, 8, 127979) Both are quite unnecessary, I am sure.
('71', 64, 3, 9, 128018) And where is the difficulty in having local earth bandage?

('71', 64, 3, 12, 128211) Therefore you must not omit them unless you find that they hurt.
('71', 64, 3, 13, 128276) I hope the books have reached you.
('71', 64, 3, 14, 128311) The parcel was given to R. to be sent to you.
('71', 64, 3, 15, 128357) No, I did not see the paper, nor have I received payment.
('71', 64, 3, 16, 128415) I shall see what is possible about your parcel of hand made paper.
('71', 64, 3, 17, 128482) Of course you should belong to All India Spinners Association and take much more interest than you have done in the wheel.
('71', 64, 3, 18, 128605) Though all has ended well it has cost me much but not more than was warranted by the occasion.
('71', 64, 3, 19, 128700) Jawaharlal rose to the highest height when he apologized to the Committee 1 for his speech before the Convention 2. The apology has brought him nearer to the Committee than anything else he has done during these anxious days.

('71', 65, 3, 4, 129595) PRABHA, It is Monday today, and morning just now.
('71', 65, 3, 5, 129645) Thinking that I may not get time after the day has advanced, I am writing a few lines just now.
('71', 65, 3, 6, 129741) I got your note.
('71', 65, 3, 7, 129758) Jayaprakash has not come to take away the Jaggery.
('71', 65, 3, 8, 129809) I havent seen him at all for three days.
('71', 65, 3, 9, 129850) Mridu has just left me.
('71', 65, 3, 10, 129874) I havent talked about the matter with her.
('71', 65, 3, 11, 129917) The main point, however, I have already discussed.
('71', 65, 3, 12, 129968) Am I right in believing that your staying there will also depend on your state of mind?
('71', 65, 3, 13, 130056) It seems to me that much will depend on Jayaprakashs wish.
('71', 65, 3, 14, 130115) Once you settle down in the new place, the road will be clear.
('71', 65, 3, 15, 130178) When can you leave that place?
('71', 65, 3, 16, 130209) We are now leaving this evening.
('71', 65, 3, 17, 130242) We have to reach Madras on the 26th and return to Wardha on the 31st, leaving Madras on the 30th.
('71', 65, 3, 18, 130340) You must procure a tub for hip bath.
('71', 65, 3, 19, 130377) If possible, take friction bath.
('71', 65, 3, 20, 130410) A tub doesnt seem necessary for that.
('71', 65, 3, 21, 130448) You will find out from experience.
('71', 65, 3, 22, 130483) Do you get hand ground flour?

('71', 65, 7, 30, 130804) Mridula usually gives me the news, happy or sad, of the family.

('71', 66, 3, 5, 131383) Vidya had promised to rest and not to try to come to see whilst I was in Delhi.
('71', 66, 3, 6, 131463) But I saw that she needed to come to me.
('71', 66, 3, 7, 131504) I share with you the honour of being parent both to Vidya and Anand.
('71', 66, 3, 8, 131573) I could see that she would have fared worse if she could not have come to me.
('71', 66, 3, 9, 131651) You were right in asking her not to venture out to Delhi, and she was right in satisfying her soul hunger.
('71', 66, 3, 10, 131758) I do hope you did not find her any the worse for her coming to Delhi.

('71', 67, 8, 9, 132653) KANTI 1, I could not write to you earlier.
('71', 67, 8, 10, 132696) I had a talk with Devdas.
('71', 67, 8, 11, 132722) If you wish to go to Mysore, you may do so.
('71', 67, 8, 12, 132766) If the expenses increase by your going there, Devdas will earn the money or raise it.
('71', 67, 8, 13, 132852) It is, therefore, not necessary for you to join Wilson [College, Bombay] for want of money or Devdass consent.
('71', 67, 8, 14, 132963) You may go to Trivandrum if you like.
('71', 67, 8, 15, 133001) If you get a cargo ship and desire to go by it, there is no objection.
('71', 67, 8, 16, 133072) It is certainly good to travel thus.
('71', 67, 8, 17, 133109) Devdas will bear the expense of the voyage, but if he does not, then you may ask me for it.
('71', 67, 8, 18, 133201) It would not be proper to take it from me if he can bear it.
('71', 67, 8, 19, 133262) I know Devdas could not see you.
('71', 67, 8, 20, 133295) On my asking him he told me that he had tried to see you but could not.
('71', 67, 8, 21, 133367) He did not send for you because his programme was uncertain.
('71', 67, 8, 22, 133428) One should not mind such things.
('71', 67, 8, 23, 133461) And in any case one should never be suspicious.
('71', 67, 8, 24, 133509) You may take from Nimu or Ramdas whatever money you immediately need.
('71', 67, 8, 25, 133579) We, i.e., Ba, Manu, Kanu (Junior), Mahadev, Pyarelal and I are leaving for Madras today.
('71', 67, 8, 26, 133668) We shall be there for three days, and shall be back on the 31st.

('71', 68, 1, 2, 133949) Did you cancel your proposed trip to Rajkot?
('71', 68, 1, 3, 133994) Do you wish to have Amtul Salaam with you?
('71', 68, 1, 4, 134037) She thinks that you do, but Devdass impression and mine is that you do not.
('71', 68, 1, 5, 134113) If that is the case, please write to her frankly.
('71', 68, 1, 6, 134163) She is making herself needlessly unhappy.
('71', 68, 1, 7, 134205) She was with me in Delhi as long as I was there.
('71', 68, 1, 8, 134254) My language need not be considered mathematical just because I use mathematical terms.
('71', 68, 1, 9, 134341) But if it is as exact as mathematics, that is, if its successive steps in reasoning are logical and exact, it may be described as mathematical.
('71', 68, 1, 10, 134485) If my language has that quality, it is because of my worship of truth.
('71', 68, 1, 11, 134556) One who wants to learn only a subject of intellectual study can very well do so from a person without character, and such a person may certainly be intelligent also.
('71', 68, 1, 12, 134722) For instance, a craftsman without character may be highly proficient in his craft.
('71', 68, 1, 13, 134805) But the highest intelligence or craftsmanship without good character can never do good to the world or serve it.
('71', 68, 1, 14, 134918) The effect of such service will be temporary.
('71', 68, 1, 15, 134964) That is why the Gita says: Worship me and I will give you intelligence and whatever else you need.
('71', 68, 1, 16, 135063) Worship memeans serve memy creation.
('71', 68, 1, 17, 135100) After writing these sheets I went to the library and after returning I am now drinking milk and am dictating this while doing so.
('71', 68, 1, 18, 135230) I had taken your letter to the library, just to see whether I had omitted to reply to any point.
('71', 68, 1, 19, 135327) I am replying in brief to what has been left out.
('71', 68, 1, 20, 135377) A self controlled man should be busy in service for all the twenty four hours.
('71', 68, 1, 21, 135456) If it is merely doing anything even a demon can do it.
('71', 68, 1, 22, 135511) This is in the character of a Ravana.
('71', 68, 1, 23, 135549) But such a person cannot be regarded as a self controlled man.
('71', 68, 1, 24, 135612) Activity is threefold: of body, mind and soul.
('71', 68, 1, 25, 135659) In pure service there is a combination of the three.
('71', 68, 1, 26, 135712) I do know that it is not an easy task to interpret ahimsa in mathematical language.
('71', 68, 1, 27, 135796) I am trying to do that.
('71', 68, 1, 28, 135820) And what is true of ahimsa is also true of all other things, e.g., spinning, village industries, etc.
('71', 68, 1, 29, 135922) But perhaps you will understand all this on your own if you start reading the three journals 1. I am expecting from you work of that level.
('71', 68, 1, 30, 136062) I have torn up your letter.
('71', 68, 1, 31, 136090) Nothing from it will pass to Delhi.
('71', 68, 1, 32, 136126) If you decide to go to Trivandrum, and if you do not take a ship and if you can free yourself from there, then why not join us in Madras?

('71', 69, 2, 3, 136498) March 26, 1937
('71', 69, 3, 4, 136513) Mahatmaji expressed his intention to speak in Hindi and .
('71', 69, 3, 5, 136571) said: It is not my purpose to hear my own voice.
('71', 69, 3, 6, 136620) I would like that you should all hear it and, what is more important, understand it; for otherwise there can be neither pleasure nor profit in speaking.
('71', 69, 3, 7, 136773) So kindly raise your hands, those who understand mepartially or fully.
('71', 69, 4, 8, 136844) A good number of hands went up.
('71', 69, 4, 9, 136876) And now those who cannot understand me, please put up your hands.
('71', 69, 5, 10, 136942) Gandhiji looked round at those with lifted hands and seeing Mr. G. A. Natesan among them cried out: Shame, shame!
('71', 69, 6, 11, 137056) It is a shame,Mr. Natesan agreed and added, and I am very sorry indeed. Gandhiji at once took the opportunity to impress upon those present the need for learning Hindi: You understand on whom I have just now cried shame.
('71', 69, 6, 12, 137277) It is my good old friend, Mr. Natesan.
('71', 69, 6, 13, 137316) Of course, I would not take that liberty with others.
('71', 69, 6, 14, 137370) I have known him since 1915 when I came here from South Africa and he and I understand each other.
('71', 69, 6, 15, 137469) He is a great publisher and editor.
('71', 69, 6, 16, 137505) He has also brought out translations of great Sanskrit works.
('71', 69, 6, 17, 137567) He has enthusiasm and youthfulness for such work.
('71', 69, 6, 18, 137617) But what has he done in regard to Hindi?
('71', 69, 6, 19, 137658) He may say, Oh I am old. Perhaps, he is, in body.
('71', 69, 6, 20, 137708) But let not the mind get old.
('71', 69, 6, 21, 137738) Let it go on adding to its store of knowledge.
('71', 69, 6, 22, 137785) For, one whose mind has not become old can do great good to himself and to his fellowmen.
('71', 69, 6, 23, 137875) There are still some personshappily, they are very fewwho seem to consider it a sin to look upon Hindi Hindustani as the national language and a greater sin to study it.
('71', 69, 6, 24, 138045) I can say from my experience that those who recognize the place of Hindi as the national language will take to its study with enthusiasm and earnestness, whether it be their mother tongue or not.
('71', 69, 6, 25, 138241) Otherwise, they may not be able to contribute to its growth as the national language.
('71', 69, 6, 26, 138327) Hindi cannot take the place of the different provincial languages nor is that the aim of Hindi prachar.
('71', 69, 6, 27, 138431) On the other hand, the spread of the national

('71', 70, 1, 2, 138574) language will accelerate the growth of the provincial languages and vice versa.
('71', 70, 1, 3, 138654) A strong and virile national language requires healthy development of the provincial languages.
('71', 70, 1, 4, 138750) If the latter be weak and anaemic, how can the former at all grow?
('71', 70, 2, 5, 138817) Gujarati, I said to myself, cannot be the language.
('71', 70, 2, 6, 138869) Not more than a thirtieth part of the people of the country speaks it.
('71', 70, 2, 7, 138940) How am I to find Tulsi Ramayana therein?
('71', 70, 2, 8, 138981) What about Marathi, then, I wondered.
('71', 70, 2, 9, 139019) I love Marathi.
('71', 70, 2, 10, 139035) I claim among the Marathi speaking people some staunch co workers.
('71', 70, 2, 11, 139102) I know the Maharastrians efficiency, capacity for self sacrifice, and their learning.
('71', 70, 2, 12, 139188) And yet I did not think Marathithe language that Lokamanya Tilak wielded so wonderfully wellcould be our rashtrabhasha.
('71', 70, 2, 13, 139308) When I was thus reasoning this out, let me tell you that I did not know the actual number of people speaking Hindi, and yet I instinctively felt that only Hindi could take that place, and no other.
('71', 70, 2, 14, 139506) Did I not appreciate Bengali?
('71', 70, 2, 15, 139536) I did, and I thought highly of it as the language of Chaitanya, Ram Mohun Roy, Ramakrishna, Vivekananda and Rabindranath Tagore.
('71', 70, 2, 16, 139665) And yet I felt that we could not make even Bengali the language of inter provincial intercourse.
('71', 70, 3, 17, 139762) I was convinced long ago, and my conviction has grown stronger since from experience, that if any Indian language can ever become Indias national languageand some one must become the national language if Indians are to become a nationthat language was only Hindi, and I have always directed my efforts in its cause.
('71', 70, 3, 18, 140078) No doubt, in the South we are up against a great problem in this matter.
('71', 70, 3, 19, 140151) But we cannot see how a language of the South, Tamil or Telugu or any other, can serve as the national language.
('71', 70, 3, 20, 140264) I honestly tried to learn Telugu and Tamil.
('71', 70, 3, 21, 140308) Indeed there was a time when I could speak in Tamil quite as well as I am now speaking Hindi.
('71', 70, 3, 22, 140402) I had sufficient material when I was in South Africa to assist me in this, because I had to work in the midst of Tamils.
('71', 70, 3, 23, 140523) but I must confess, to my regret and shame, that I have not kept up touch with it and have forgotten what little I knew of that language.
('71', 70, 3, 24, 140661) I am not wholly responsible for it.
('71', 70, 3, 25, 140697) The blame for it rests partly on my Tamil friends.
('71', 70, 3, 26, 140748) I have taken a girl 2 from Tamil Nad into my household as my daughter in law.
('71', 70, 3, 27, 140826) But instead of compelling me to keep touch with Tamil, she has learnt Hindi and Gujarati and speaks and writes in

('71', 71, 1, 4, 141221) Nor is my Hindi particularly good.
('71', 71, 1, 5, 141256) My friends behind, who are all proficient in Hindi, laugh at my Hindi pronunciation and grammar.
('71', 71, 1, 6, 141353) I know both are erratic for I have not studied either.
('71', 71, 1, 7, 141408) It will do for my purpose if I am able to express my thoughts so as to be understood.
('71', 71, 1, 8, 141494) If I attempt to be grammatical, I am afraid the results will not be very complimentary to me.
('71', 71, 1, 9, 141588) I must, on this occasion, express my regret at the absence of any book to help Hindi speaking people to learn Tamil.
('71', 71, 1, 10, 141705) If they want to learn Tamil, they have to do it through English.
('71', 71, 1, 11, 141770) We have not shown the zeal in this cause which some Western Missionaries have evinced.
('71', 71, 1, 12, 141857) I would appeal to Tamils and also my North Indian friends to remedy this defect.
('71', 71, 1, 13, 141938) I am thankful to my South Indian friends for the enthusiasm they have shown in learning Hindi but I must say it is not sufficient.
('71', 71, 1, 14, 142069) It is a unique event that the session of the All India Sahitya Sammelan is being held in Madras, where Tamil is the chief language.
('71', 71, 1, 15, 142201) Tamil, of all the Dravidian languages, has borrowed least from Sanskrit.
('71', 71, 1, 16, 142274) This, no doubt, is a handicap to Tamilians in learning Hindi.
('71', 71, 1, 17, 142336) But still they have striven to learn the language.
('71', 71, 2, 18, 142387) I certainly congratulate you on what you have achieved.
('71', 71, 2, 19, 142443) But I should be satisfied only when distinguished people like my friend G. A. Natesan, member of the Council of State, give half an hour each day to the study of Hindi.
('71', 71, 2, 20, 142612) Let him not plead old age.
('71', 71, 2, 21, 142639) If he is not too old to edit the Indian Review, if he is not too old to study Sanskrit and issue Sanskrit publications one after another, if he is not too old to go to the Council of State, why should he be too old to learn Hindi?
('71', 71, 2, 22, 142870) What I mean to say is this.
('71', 71, 2, 23, 142898) Up till now only the middleclass people have taken up the study of Hindi.
('71', 71, 2, 24, 142972) When will our distinguished leaders take it up?
('71', 71, 2, 25, 143020) When will the Advocate General find half an hour to leave his briefs aside and devote it to Hindi?
('71', 71, 2, 26, 143119) I want men and women among the most distinguished of the South to study Hindi.

('71', 72, 1, 2, 143316) 84. SHAMEFUL IF TRUE
('71', 72, 2, 3, 143337) A correspondent in British Malabar writes: 1
('71', 72, 3, 4, 143382) I desire you kindly to comment on the following incident which has
('71', 72, 4, 5, 143449) agitated me considerably.
('71', 72, 4, 6, 143475) A public procession was organized by the
('71', 72, 5, 7, 143516) Congress workers of our village on the eve of the General Elections to the
('71', 72, 6, 8, 143591) Assembly.
('71', 72, 6, 9, 143601) A Harijan boy of the place wished to go along with the
('71', 72, 7, 10, 143656) procession.
('71', 72, 7, 11, 143668) But the organizers requested him to keep away, mildly saying to
('71', 72, 8, 12, 143732) him, Of course, as you know, we are in full sympathy with you.
('71', 72, 8, 13, 143795) But the
('71', 72, 9, 14, 143803) procession has to go through by lanes along which you people are not
('71', 72, 10, 15, 143872) generally allowed.
('71', 72, 10, 16, 143891) Then again, we fear that the orthodox may make this a
('71', 72, 11, 17, 143945) plea for voting against the Congress.
('71', 72, 11, 18, 143983) We, therefore, consider it prudent
('71', 72, 12, 19, 144018) that you do not accompany us. The poor boy returned with a heavy
('71', 72, 13, 20, 144083) This ill treatment of the noble Harijan lad, if the report is true, deserves severe condemnation, and victory at elections or in other matters is not worth anything if it is bought with the suppression of Harijan liberty.
('71', 72, 13, 21, 144305) The prohibition against Harijans making use of the roads in the place mentioned is an illegal act and ought not to be tolerated for a single day.
('71', 72, 13, 22, 144451) Workers should reason with the objectors, and if they do not listen, a test case should be made by taking a few Harijans through the prohibited streets.
('71', 72, 13, 23, 144604) One would have thought that in Malabar at least such things as are described by the correspondent would not happen.

('71', 72, 15, 26, 144769) Just lately I read a review of your conference 2 with Mrs. Sanger, the
('71', 72, 16, 27, 144840) birth control advocate.
('71', 72, 16, 28, 144864) I was so deeply moved that I am writing you to express
('71', 72, 17, 29, 144919) my appreciation for your stand.
('71', 72, 17, 30, 144951) God bless you for your courage.
('71', 72, 18, 31, 144983) I realize it will take centuries to educate the public to higher ideals, but
('71', 72, 19, 32, 145060) there is no time like the present to begin.
('71', 72, 19, 33, 145104) I fear she mistakes passion for love,
('71', 72, 20, 34, 145142) for love is of the spirit and never born of lust.

('71', 73, 0, 1, 145279) 74 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 73, 1, 2, 145320) Dr. Alexis Carrel agrees with you, in that sex control is not harmful
('71', 73, 2, 3, 145390) except to those who feed their passions and are already unbalanced.
('71', 73, 3, 4, 145458) Sanger is wrong in saying that most doctors believe abstinence is harmful.
('71', 73, 4, 5, 145533) find many leading doctors and scientists belonging to the American Social
('71', 73, 5, 6, 145607) Hygiene Association hold that control is beneficial.
('71', 73, 6, 7, 145660) You are doing a noble work.
('71', 73, 6, 8, 145688) You are one of the few who have this
('71', 73, 7, 9, 145725) higher spiritual viewpoint on the sex question.
('71', 73, 8, 10, 145773) Let us keep up the good work so that youth may know the truth, for the hope of the future is in their hands.
('71', 73, 9, 11, 145882) I add a quotation from one of my talks to boys: .
('71', 73, 9, 12, 145932) Creation physical, mental and spiritualis joy and life.
('71', 73, 9, 13, 145988) If you are merely seeking the sensations of the flesh with no thought of creating, or even trying to avoid the aim of creation you are perverting nature and killing your spiritual powers.
('71', 73, 10, 14, 146176) I know this is like a prophet crying in the wilderness, but I am convinced of the truth of it, and I can but point the way.
('71', 73, 10, 15, 146300) This is one of the letters 1 which I occasionally get from America in condemnation of the use of contraceptives.
('71', 73, 10, 16, 146413) Current literature that India imports weekly from the Far West would have us believe that in America none but idiots and imbeciles oppose the use of this modern method of deliverance from the bondage of the superstition which imprisons the body and crushes it by denying it its supreme enjoyment.
('71', 73, 10, 17, 146710) That literature produces as much momentary intoxication as the act which it teaches and incites us to perform without incurring the risk of its oridinary result.
('71', 73, 10, 18, 146872) I do not put before the readers of Harijan merely letters of individual condemnation received from the West.
('71', 73, 10, 19, 146981) They have their use for me as a seeker but very little for the general reader.
('71', 73, 10, 20, 147060) This letter, however, from a teacher of boys with thirty years experience behind him has a definite value.
('71', 73, 10, 21, 147167) It should serve as a guide for Indian teachers and the publicmen and womenwho are carried away by the overwhelming tide.
('71', 73, 10, 22, 147288) The use of contraceptives is infinitely more tempting than the whisky bottle.
('71', 73, 10, 23, 147366) But it is not more lawful than the sparkling liquid for its fatal temptation.
('71', 73, 10, 24, 147444) Nor can opposition to the use of either be given up in despair because their use seems to be growing.
('71', 73, 10, 25, 147546) If the opponents have faith in their mission, it has to be pursued.
('71', 73, 10, 26, 147614) A voice in the wilderness has a potency which voices uttered in the midst of the madding crowd lack.

('71', 74, 1, 2, 147802) voice in the wilderness has meditation, deliberation and unquenchable faith behind it, whilst the babel of voices has generally nothing but the backing of the experience of personal enjoyment or the false and sentimental pity for the unwanted children and their suffering mothers.
('71', 74, 1, 3, 148083) Argument of personal experience has as much weight as an act of a drunkard.
('71', 74, 1, 4, 148159) The argument of pity is a trap into which it is dangerous to fall.
('71', 74, 1, 5, 148226) Sufferings of unwanted children and of equally unwanted motherhood are punishments or warnings devised by beneficent nature.
('71', 74, 1, 6, 148351) Disregard of the law of discipline and restraint is suicide.
('71', 74, 1, 7, 148412) Ours is a state of probation.
('71', 74, 1, 8, 148442) If we refuse to bear the yoke of discipline we court failure like cowards, we avoid battle and give up the only joy of living.
('71', 74, 1, 9, 148569) Harijan, 27 3 1937
('71', 74, 2, 10, 148588) 86. THE MEANING OF IT I have a wire from Gwalior saying that the notice board in Mahakaleshwar temple in Ujjain, prohibiting the entry into it of Harijans and those who may be associating with or working with them, has been withdrawn by the Maharaja.
('71', 74, 2, 11, 148839) Before one can pronounce an opinion on the notice it is necessary to know its full meaning.
('71', 74, 2, 12, 148931) If the prohibition is not withdrawn but only the offending notice board is, the withdrawal brings no relief to the insulted Harijans and their caste associates.
('71', 74, 2, 13, 149092) It may even bring punishment to the unwary who seeing the notice board withdrawn may venture to enter the temple.
('71', 74, 2, 14, 149206) If it means withdrawal of the prohibition itself, one would expect a notification to that effect.
('71', 74, 2, 15, 149304) And if the prohibition is withdrawn from one temple, why not from all State owned temples of which I am informed there are nearly fifty in Gwalior State?
('71', 74, 2, 16, 149458) I hope, therefore, that the State authorities will clear the point and tell the public what the withdrawal of the notice board means.
('71', 74, 2, 17, 149592) Indeed there seems to be a timidity on the part of the Princes and their advisers on this matter of doing elementary justice to the poorest and the neediest of their people, and that, too, in a matter which has first class religious value but which costs them nothing materially.
('71', 74, 2, 18, 149872) The most striking example of Travancore should have shown them that if they threw open their temples to Harijans there would be no resentment.
('71', 74, 2, 19, 150015) But it may be that the Princes are afraid of the middle class Hindus with whom they come in daily contact and that they are not concerned about the silent sufferersthe bulk of the poorestwhether they be Harijans or others.
('71', 74, 2, 20, 150238) Save for a few Princes who may be counted on the fingers of ones hands the vast majority have themselves no religious scruples about untouchability.

('71', 75, 0, 1, 150396) 76 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 75, 1, 2, 150437) Hindu Princes who are supposed to be custodians of the faith, as is shown by the titles they assume, continue to neglect this obvious duty of throwing open their temples to Harijans?
('71', 75, 1, 3, 150620) I drew attention the other day 1 to the title of the Maharaja of Travancore.
('71', 75, 1, 4, 150697) Now I learn from D. B. Har Bilas Sarda that the Maharajas of Oodeypore 2 are entitled Diwans inasmuch as they are ministers of the deity of their clan, and that whenever they visit their temples in Oodeypore they officiate like priests for the deity.
('71', 75, 1, 5, 150948) I would therefore respectfully urge the Princes and their advisers boldly and unequivocally to throw open the temples in their respective States and prove themselves worthy trustees of their faith.

('71', 75, 3, 8, 151194) The following has been received from Shri L. N. Gopalaswami, Secretary, Tamil Nad Harijan Sevak Sangh:
('71', 75, 4, 9, 151297) I am very glad to communicate to you the very good news regarding the settlement of troubles between a big section of the Nattars called the Tennilai Nattarsand the Harijans of that locality.
('71', 75, 5, 10, 151489) The following is the true translation of the agreement entered into between the heads of both the parties: COPY OF THE AGREEMENT DATED FEBURARY 24, 1937
('71', 75, 6, 11, 151642) We, the Harijans and Nattars of Tennilai Nadu, have in the presence of Smt.
('71', 75, 6, 12, 151718) Kamala Sivasubramaniam, Secretary, Harijan Sevak Sangh, Karaikudi, today resolved to forget and forgive all the differences in the past between the two communities.
('71', 75, 6, 13, 151883) In token thereof we have set our hand to the conditions of the agreement referred to below:
('71', 75, 7, 14, 151975) 1. The Harijans will not be forced to do labour.
('71', 75, 7, 15, 152024) They are at perfect liberty to take wages for the work they do and refuse to do work for those who do not pay.
('71', 75, 7, 16, 152135) 2. Wearing of dress: The Harijans are entitled to use shirts and upper clothes as they like, and the women all kinds of ornaments as they please.
('71', 75, 7, 17, 152281) But on the car day festival of Kandadevi and Eluvancottah, the males will not wear shirts as the chief Nattars themselves do not do so.
('71', 75, 7, 18, 152417) 3. The Harijans can build any type of houses they please according to their wishes and capacities.

('71', 76, 2, 4, 152858) One may hope also that the terms will be strictly observed by the Nattars.
('71', 76, 2, 5, 152933) But it is humiliating to find that a portion of Indian humanity cannot wear the dress or ornaments they like and receive wages for their labour except by the grace of another supposed to be superior to them but in reality no better than the first.

('71', 76, 9, 14, 153427) March 27, 1937 The Mahamahopadhyayas speech has whetted my appetite for a study of Tamil, which neither age nor desire would deter me from undertaking, but only the want of time makes difficult.
('71', 76, 9, 15, 153622) The object of this conference is to collect gems from all provincial literatures and to make them available through Hindi.
('71', 76, 9, 16, 153745) For this purpose I would make an appeal to you.
('71', 76, 9, 17, 153793) Of course everyone must know his own language thoroughly well, and he should also know the great literature of other Indian languages through Hindi.
('71', 76, 9, 18, 153942) But it is also the object of this conference to stimulate in our people the desire to know languages of other provinces, e.g., Gujaratis should know Tamil, Bengalis should

('71', 77, 0, 1, 154175) 78 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 77, 1, 2, 154216) know Gujarati and so on.
('71', 77, 1, 3, 154241) And I tell you from experience that it is not at all difficult to pick up another Indian language.
('71', 77, 1, 4, 154340) But to this end a common script is quite essential.
('71', 77, 1, 5, 154392) It is not difficult to achieve in Tamil Nad.
('71', 77, 1, 6, 154437) For look at this simple fact: over 90 per cent of our people are illiterate.
('71', 77, 1, 7, 154514) We have to start with a clean state with them.
('71', 77, 1, 8, 154561) Why should we not start making them literate by means of a common script?
('71', 77, 1, 9, 154635) In Europe they have tried the experiment of a common script quite successfully.
('71', 77, 1, 10, 154715) Some people even go the length of saying that we might adopt the Roman script from Europe.
('71', 77, 1, 11, 154806) After a good deal of controversy there is a consensus of opinion that the common script can be Devnagari and none else.
('71', 77, 1, 12, 154926) Urdu is claimed as a rival, but I think neither Urdu nor Roman has the perfection and phonetic capacity of Devnagari.
('71', 77, 1, 13, 155044) Please remember that I say nothing against your languages.
('71', 77, 1, 14, 155103) Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada must be there and will be there.
('71', 77, 1, 15, 155170) But why not teach the illiterate in these parts these languages through the Devnagari script?
('71', 77, 1, 16, 155264) In the interest of the national unity we desire to achieve, the adoption of Devnagari as a common script is so essential.
('71', 77, 1, 17, 155386) Here it is a question of just shedding our provincialism and narrowness, there are no difficulties at all.
('71', 77, 1, 18, 155493) Not that I do not like Tamil or Urdu scripts.
('71', 77, 1, 19, 155539) I know both.
('71', 77, 1, 20, 155552) But service of the motherland, to which all my life is being given and without which life would be insupp ortable for me, has taught me that we should try to lift unneccessary burdens off our people.
('71', 77, 1, 21, 155752) The burden of knowing many scripts is unnecessary and easily avoidable.
('71', 77, 1, 22, 155824) I would appeal to men of letters of all provinces to resolve their differences on this point and be agreed on this matter of prime importance.
('71', 77, 1, 23, 155967) Then and then only can the Bharatiya Sahitya Parishad be a success.
('71', 77, 1, 24, 156035) Then you have to think of ways and means for carrying on our work.
('71', 77, 1, 25, 156102) Hans is now defunct.
('71', 77, 1, 26, 156123) 1 Its founder was Premchandji who is no more.
('71', 77, 1, 27, 156169) Unfortunately Premchandji did not leave anyone to take his place.
('71', 77, 1, 28, 156235) Indeed, there was none that could adequately fill his place, for he was an unrivalled writer.
('71', 77, 1, 29, 156329) But that was not the reason for the stopping of the Hans.
('71', 77, 1, 30, 156387) It ceased even when he was alive.
('71', 77, 1, 31, 156421) Its cessation was dueit was a pityto the paucity of the number of men who sympathized with or took sufficient interest in the method of work adopted by the journal.
('71', 77, 1, 32, 156586) All the articles there were drawn from different provincial languages and were written in the Nagari script.

('71', 78, 1, 2, 156784) you accept the ideal of a common script, it would be your duty to earnestly work for this objective of the Parishad.
('71', 78, 1, 3, 156901) Kakasaheb has told you that he is issuing periodical booklets now, but the whole thing cannot yet be said to have caught on.
('71', 78, 1, 4, 157026) I want you to shed your apathy and lend a helping hand.
('71', 78, 1, 5, 157082) You must remember that the whole work falls on the shoulders of the chief workers of the Sammelan.
('71', 78, 1, 6, 157181) Our work suffers not for want of funds, but for want of workers.
('71', 78, 1, 7, 157246) We want them from every province.
('71', 78, 1, 8, 157280) Kakasaheb said that we had limited the number of our governing body to 50 members, but that does not mean that it does not want more workers.
('71', 78, 1, 9, 157422) Today our literature is in the interest of the few, i.e., of the few literates.
('71', 78, 1, 10, 157502) Even among the literates there would be few who are really interested in literature.
('71', 78, 1, 11, 157587) Our country lives in the villages, but we have not gone to the villages to do the countrys work.
('71', 78, 1, 12, 157684) What I saw in Segaon is to be seen in every Indian village.
('71', 78, 1, 13, 157744) You will be surprised that out of about six hundred villagers in Segaon, not two can read good literature.
('71', 78, 1, 14, 157851) Every day a gentleman goes to the village to read out to them the days news from the dailies.
('71', 78, 1, 15, 157945) But it is with great hardship that he is able to get two villagers to listen to him.
('71', 78, 1, 16, 158030) You can very well understand from this whata stupendous task it must be to carry good literature to their door.
('71', 78, 1, 17, 158142) It is the aim of the Parishad to remove that defect.
('71', 78, 1, 18, 158195) I am not mad after any particular script, but I want you to take a considered and dispassionate view of the question.
('71', 78, 1, 19, 158313) I appeal to you to give this Parishad as much assistance as you can.
('71', 78, 2, 20, 158382) Kakasaheb has told you the kind of literature to which we have limited ourselves.
('71', 78, 2, 21, 158464) I am not fond of literature for its own sake, I do not make a fetish of literacy either.
('71', 78, 2, 22, 158553) Literacy must be one of the many means for intellectual development, but we have had in the past intellectual giants who were unlettered.
('71', 78, 2, 23, 158691) That is why we have confined ourselves only to literature of the cleanest and healthiest kind.
('71', 78, 2, 24, 158786) How can we have this, unless we have your hearty co operation and unless you are prepared to select suitable literature in your respective languages?

('71', 79, 2, 3, 159077) Shri Kakubhai writes to say from Bombay: 1
('71', 79, 3, 4, 159120) This increase may be regarded as fairly satisfactory.
('71', 79, 3, 5, 159174) There is no reason to be pleased at the daily sale of khadi worth Rs. 1,000 in the biggest khadi bhandar in the country, and that too, in a city like Bombay.
('71', 79, 3, 6, 159332) For me the sale of khadi is the best thermometer for measuring Indias peaceful progress.
('71', 79, 3, 7, 159421) The reader should also bear in mind that this Rs. 1,000 includes orders which have been received from outside also.
('71', 79, 3, 8, 159537) How many shops are there in Bombay which sell mill cloth both foreign and Indian?
('71', 79, 3, 9, 159619) What is their daily sale?
('71', 79, 3, 10, 159645) And how many khadi shops are there?
('71', 79, 3, 11, 159681) We shall have to hang our heads in shame if these figures are compared.
('71', 79, 3, 12, 159753) Despite this, we can derive satisfaction from the fact that khadi worth Rs. 1,000 is being sold and, this time, an increase in sale has been recorded.
('71', 79, 3, 13, 159904) Shri Kakubhai cannot give any reason for the increase in sale.
('71', 79, 3, 14, 159967) I found from my conversation with Shri Vithaldas Jerajani that this sale was in no way connected with the enthusiasm about the Legislative Assembly.
('71', 79, 3, 15, 160116) Had it been the case, the increase would have amounted to not one, but many thousands.
('71', 79, 3, 16, 160203) Hence, there is some other reason behind it.
('71', 79, 3, 17, 160248) I presume that people have increasingly begun to understand the significance of khadi, and those who wear khadi are satisfied by the higher rate paid to women spinners and thus their enthusiasm for wearing it has increased.
('71', 79, 3, 18, 160472) If my guess is correct, it is something that should encourage khadi workers.
('71', 79, 3, 19, 160549) I have found out something of practical significance.
('71', 79, 3, 20, 160603) The softness and durability of khadi have increased to a considerable extent ever since the rate for spinning has been increased and the work of women spinners is being supervised.
('71', 79, 3, 21, 160784) The reason for this is obvious.
('71', 79, 3, 22, 160816) And that too is something that should encourage us.
('71', 79, 3, 23, 160868) If readers of Harijanbandhu can throw some light on this, they should write to me.

('71', 79, 4, 25, 160992) 1 The letter is not translated here.
('71', 79, 4, 26, 161029) The correspondent had given details to show that the sale of khadi had increased notwithstanding the rise in prices.
('71', 79, 4, 27, 161146) He had expressed the hope that it would increase further.

('71', 80, 2, 3, 161300) [March 28, 1937] 2
('71', 80, 3, 4, 161319) If the Congress went on as usual while we passed resolutions in support of Hindi as the common language, our work would be painfully slow.
('71', 80, 3, 5, 161458) This resolution appeals to the Congress to exclude the use of English as a language of inter provincial communication.
('71', 80, 3, 6, 161577) English, it says, should not be allowed to take either the place of the provincial languages or of Hindi.
('71', 80, 3, 7, 161683) If English had not ousted the languages of the people, the provincial languages would have been wonderfully rich today.
('71', 80, 3, 8, 161803) If England had adopted French as the language of her national deliberations we should have had no English literature today.
('71', 80, 3, 9, 161927) French was the language there after the Norman conquest.
('71', 80, 3, 10, 161984) But then the tide turned in favour of English undefiled.
('71', 80, 3, 11, 162041) That created the great English literature we know.
('71', 80, 3, 12, 162092) What Yakub Hussain Saheb said was quite right.
('71', 80, 3, 13, 162139) The Mussalman contact had a great influence on our culture and civilization, so much so that there were men like the late Pandit Ajodhyanath who were perfect scholars in Persian and Arabic.
('71', 80, 3, 14, 162329) If they had given to their mother tongue all the time that they gave to the study of Arabic and Persian, the mother tongue would have made great progress.
('71', 80, 3, 15, 162484) Then English came to occupy the unnatural position it does until this day.
('71', 80, 3, 16, 162559) University professors can wax eloquent in English but will not be able to express their thoughts in their own mother tongue.
('71', 80, 3, 17, 162684) Sir C. V. Ramans researches are all contained in his papers in English.
('71', 80, 3, 18, 162756) They are a sealed book to those who do not know English.
('71', 80, 3, 19, 162813) But look at the position in
('71', 80, 4, 20, 162841) 1 The speech is extracted from Mahadev Desais Weekly Letter.
('71', 80, 4, 21, 162902) Before Gandhijis speech the Parishad had passed a resolution, drafted by C. Rajagop alachari, which read: This Conference appeals to the Working Committee of the Indian National Congress to resolve not to use English in future in the proceedings of the Congress, the A. I. C. C. and the Working Committee and to use Hindi Hindustani instead; provided that those who are not able to express themselves fully in Hindi Hindustani may use English.
('71', 80, 4, 22, 163346) If a member who is unable to express himself in Hindi Hindustani desires to speak in his provincial language, he may do so, and arrangements may be made for translating such a speech into Hindi Hindustani.
('71', 80, 4, 23, 163552) If any person finds it necessary on any occasion to speak in English to make himself understood by any section of the audience, he may do so with the permission of the Chairman. 2 Gandhi 1915 1948: A Detailed Chronology
('71', 81, 0, 1, 163772) 82 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 81, 1, 2, 163813) Russia.
('71', 81, 1, 3, 163821) Even before the Revolution they resolved to have all their textbooks (including scientific) in Russian.
('71', 81, 1, 4, 163925) That really prepared the way for Lenins Revolution.
('71', 81, 1, 5, 163977) We cannot establish real mass contacts until the Congress decides to have all its deliberations in Hindi and of its provincial organizations in the pvovincial languages.
('71', 81, 2, 6, 164147) The resolution becomes as much a business of the Bharatiya Parishad as of the Sammelan, for the Bharatiya Parishad is intended to advance the cause of the provincial languages, and if the Congress does not adopt the resolution its object will be to that extent frustrated.
('71', 81, 3, 7, 164420) It is not that I am making a fetish of language.
('71', 81, 3, 8, 164469) It is not that I would refuse to have swaraj if I could have it at the cost of our language, as indeed I should refuse to have it at the cost of Truth and Non violence.
('71', 81, 3, 9, 164638) But I insist so much on the language because it is a powerful means of achieving national unity, and the more firmly it is established the broader based will be our unity.
('71', 81, 4, 10, 164810) Dont be alarmed at my proposal of everyone learning Hindi plus a language of other provinces, besides his mother tongue.
('71', 81, 4, 11, 164931) Languages are easily learnt.
('71', 81, 4, 12, 164960) Max Muller knew 14 languages; and I know a German girl who knew 11 languages when she came here five years ago and now knows two or three Indian languages.
('71', 81, 4, 13, 165116) But you have created before your minds eye a bugbear and somehow feel that you cannot express yourselves in Hindi.
('71', 81, 4, 14, 165231) It is our mental laziness that we have made no progress in spite of Hindustani being adopted in our Congress constitution these 12 years.
('71', 81, 5, 15, 165369) Yakub Hussain Saheb asked me why I insisted so much on Hindi Hindustani and was not content with having simple Hind ustani as the common language.
('71', 81, 5, 16, 165516) I must take you through the genesis of the whole thing.
('71', 81, 5, 17, 165572) It was as early as 1918 that as President of the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan I suggested 1 to the Hindi speaking world to broaden their definition of Hindi to include Urdu.
('71', 81, 5, 18, 165740) When I presided over the Sammelan once again in 1935 2 I had the word Hindi properly defined as a language that was spoken both by Hindus and Mussalmans and written in Devnagari or Urdu script.
('71', 81, 5, 19, 165934) My object

('71', 82, 1, 2, 166104) in doing so was to include in Hindi the high flown Urdu of Maulana Shibli and the high flown Hindi of Pandit Shyamsunderdas.
('71', 82, 1, 3, 166229) Then came the Bharatiya Sahitya Parishad, also an off shoot of the Sammelan.
('71', 82, 1, 4, 166306) At my suggestion the name Hindi Hindustani was adopted in the place of Hindi.
('71', 82, 1, 5, 166384) Abdul Huq Saheb stoutly opposed me there.
('71', 82, 1, 6, 166426) I could not accept his suggestion.
('71', 82, 1, 7, 166461) I should have done violence to myself and to the Sammelan if I had given up the word Hindi which was the word of the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan and which I had persuaded them to define so as to include Urdu.
('71', 82, 1, 8, 166665) We must remember that the word Hindi is not of Hindu coinage, it was coined after the Muslim advent to describe the language which Hindus of the North spoke and studied.
('71', 82, 1, 9, 166835) So many Mussalman writers of note have described their language as Hindi.
('71', 82, 1, 10, 166909) And why now this quarrel over words when Hindi is defined to include the variations spoken and written by Hindus and Mussalmans?
('71', 82, 1, 11, 167038) Than there is another factor to be considered.
('71', 82, 1, 12, 167085) So far as South Indian languages are concerned it is only Hindi with a large number of Sanskrit words that can appeal to them, for they are already familiar with a certain number of Sanskrit words and the Sanskrit sound.
('71', 82, 1, 13, 167306) When the twoHindi and Hindustani or Urduamalgamate and really become the all India language, daily augmented by the introduction of provincial words, we shall have a vocabulary richer even than the English vocabulary.
('71', 82, 1, 14, 167524) I hope you now understand why I insist on Hindi Hindustani.
('71', 82, 1, 15, 167584) And then I would give a tip to such of you as dread the advent of Hindi Hindustani as the only language of the Congress.
('71', 82, 1, 16, 167705) Invest in a Hindi daily or a good book, read aloud part of it regularly even for five minutes, select passages from well known Hindi writings andspeeches and repeat them to yourselves, for correct intonation, make a point of learning a few Hindi words every day, and I assure you that such regular practice will be enough to enable you to express yourselves well in Hindi Hindustani in six months time and without putting an undue strain on your memory.

('71', 83, 2, 3, 168247) MADRAS, March 28, 1937 Representative: As the reputed co author of the resolution 2 of the A. I. C. C. on office acceptance, can you throw some light on the position as it has emerged today?
('71', 83, 2, 4, 168438) GANDHIJI: It is definite that I am not saying anything about politics.
('71', 83, 2, 5, 168509) That must be understood.
('71', 83, 2, 6, 168534) R. Are you aware that an opinion has been expressed that each side has but tried to put the other in the wrong and that that opinion seems to be held by responsible public men?
('71', 83, 2, 7, 168711) G. I do not know about it.
('71', 83, 2, 8, 168738) I have not yet seen this evenings papers.
('71', 83, 2, 9, 168780) The interviewer had to switch on to other topics and he sought Gandhijis views on the progress of Hindi in South India with particular reference to the resolution 3 adopted by the All India Sahitya Sammelan that day urging the exclusive use of Hindi in Congress deliberations.
('71', 83, 2, 10, 169057) G. The progress made in the matter of Hindi is comparatively speaking good.
('71', 83, 2, 11, 169133) Whereas some years back there was hardly anybody who knew Hindi, today there is a big establishment looking after the training in Hindi of several thousands of boys and girls and men and women.
('71', 83, 2, 12, 169327) That is a sign of progress.
('71', 83, 2, 13, 169355) But I cannot say I am satisfied with the response from all the four Provinces of the South so far as the leaders of public opinion are concerned.
('71', 83, 2, 14, 169501) I very much fear they have not taken up the study of Hindi seriously so as to be able to carry on conversation in Hindi or to understand what is going on in the Hindi Press or to be able to speak to the multitude in northern Provinces.
('71', 83, 2, 15, 169737) It is therefore a happy thing that for the first time in the history of a southern Province, the Hindi Sammelan was invited and had its sittings in Madras.
('71', 83, 2, 16, 169893) I hope and believe the prejudice that Hindi was intended to supplant the provincial languages has by this time been set at rest.
('71', 83, 2, 17, 170022) Indeed the effort of the Sammelan is to strengthen the provincial

('71', 84, 1, 2, 170343) languages also.
('71', 84, 1, 3, 170359) If the provincial languages are not strong, Hindi as a language of inter provincial intercourse would not be able to thrive.
('71', 84, 1, 4, 170484) Love of Hindi as the rashtrabhasha must go hand in hand with love of provincial languages.
('71', 84, 1, 5, 170575) It was indeed a great thing that with unanimous consent, this resolution asking the Working Committee of the Congress to stop the use of English in all India proceedings has been passed.
('71', 84, 1, 6, 170762) I have no doubt that English has enjoyed a status and importance in public affairs which it should never have enjoyed.
('71', 84, 1, 7, 170881) He who runs can see that this usurpation by English of the place that belongs to Hindi or Hindustani has to that extent delayed the progress of Hindi and also of the vernaculars.
('71', 84, 1, 8, 171060) It is not a very flattering admission on our part that the riches and discoveries of physical sciences cannot be accurately described in the provincial languages or in Hindi.
('71', 84, 1, 9, 171235) I am convinced that it is sheer laziness on our part which makes us say so.
('71', 84, 1, 10, 171311) These two conferences, the Sammelan and the Bharatiya Sahitya Parishad, will have rendered a useful service if the eyes of leaders of opinion in the South are opened to this obvious fact.
('71', 84, 1, 11, 171499) R. If, as you say, the fear that the spread of Hindi may be prejudicial to the growth of provincial languages is dying down, is not the suggestion for the adoption of a common script for all Indian languages likely to be a disturbing factor?
('71', 84, 2, 12, 171741) G. That is a question very well put.
('71', 84, 2, 13, 171778) It should be most unfortunate if the suggestion that we should have a common script for the provincial languages disturbs in any way the provincial mind that it is an attempt directly or indirectly to undermine the importance of provincial languages.
('71', 84, 2, 14, 172029) I can say without fear of contradiction that nothing was farther from my thoughts than that by the adoption of a common script the chances of provincial languages should be reduced.
('71', 84, 2, 15, 172211) On the other hand, a common script would remove a great difficulty from the path of persons wanting to learn languages of India other than their own and would thereby facilitate the study of those languages.
('71', 84, 2, 16, 172419) My observation was based on personal experience and that of the experience of co workers.
('71', 84, 2, 17, 172509) We are an illiterate nation, illiterate in the sense that hardly seven per cent of the people of India can trace their own alphabet.
('71', 84, 2, 18, 172642) What are you going to do to the other ninety or ninety three per cent?
('71', 84, 2, 19, 172713) Should the seven or ten per cent of literates, because they are associated with a particular form of script and because they have associated the provincial sound with those signs, impose those signs on the ninety or
('71', 85, 0, 1, 172929) 86 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 85, 1, 2, 172970) ninetythree per cent and make it difficult for them to learn other provincial languages?
('71', 85, 1, 3, 173059) A little care for the illiterate masses and a little thought about all India should convince the seven per cent of provincial literates of the necessity of adopting a common script.
('71', 85, 1, 4, 173241) Has the adoption of a common script in Europe prevented the growth of different European languages in any shape or form?
('71', 85, 2, 5, 173362) Conversation then turned on the rural uplift work which was being carried on in Segaon village and Gandhiji sat up and said: You can talk to me freely of it.
('71', 85, 2, 6, 173520) You can talk to me of khadi, the Charkha, basket making and paper making.
('71', 85, 3, 7, 173594) R. Had paper making made great progress in your Segaon reconstruction scheme?
('71', 85, 3, 8, 173672) G. If I get a contract for paper from newspapers, I hope to be able to supply their requirements, though I am not just now competing with the paper mills.
('71', 85, 3, 9, 173827) For, were I to enter into that competition just now, I must needs neglect the anti malaria work.
('71', 85, 4, 10, 173924) Speaking of malaria, Gandhiji said that preventive measures and diet were the most important items in anti malaria work.
('71', 85, 4, 11, 174045) Administration of quinine, he said, was of no avail unless food was given to the people at the same time.
('71', 85, 4, 12, 174151) Gandhiji added: I have got to give them milk or buttermilk in all cases without exception and advise the adoption of a diet which would enable them to survive the disease.
('71', 85, 4, 13, 174323) I am convinced that diet is more important than drugs and good food better than constant drugging.
('71', 85, 5, 14, 174422) An interesting piece of information which Gandhiji gave out in this connection was that he had hardly taken drugs except on two occasions.
('71', 85, 6, 15, 174561) R. Would you suggest a six month plan for Congress members of the Legislatures on these lines of rural work as the Legislatures, apparently, will have a holiday for the period?
('71', 85, 7, 16, 174738) G. Jawaharlal can prescribe one.
('71', 85, 8, 17, 174771) Gandhiji then answered a few questions about khadi.
('71', 85, 8, 18, 174823) At first, he said, he was inclined to think that enthusiasm for it had abated.
('71', 85, 8, 19, 174902) But the monthly increases in the sales of khadi made him hesitate to pronounce any opinion that love of khadi had abated.
('71', 85, 8, 20, 175024) It was certainly true, he said, that whereas formerly a forest of khadi caps was visible, one did not see such demonstrations now.
('71', 85, 8, 21, 175155) That, however, was no test of the real love of khadi.
('71', 85, 8, 22, 175209) Gandhiji added: I do notice this happy result of the increase in the wages of spinners that it has not affected the demand for khadi, as some workers feared it might affect and I should be surprised if, at a date not very distant, we do not adopt a further rise in the spinners wages.

('71', 86, 1, 2, 175536) Whilst therefore Gandhiji had absolutely no sense of despair about the progress of khadi, he could not, he said, conceal from himself or from the Press and the public his desire for much greater progress than what made so far.
('71', 86, 1, 3, 175763) Conceived as a supplementary occupation for the millions of underfed villagers of India, Gandhiji said: Khadi should command the sympathy and support of town dwellers and others who required a certain amount of clothing for covering themselves.

('71', 86, 3, 6, 176056) MADRAS, March 30, 1937 Having brooded over the refusal of the Governors to give the assurances asked for by invited Congress leaders in the Majority Provinces, I feel that I must give my opinion on the situation that has arisen in the country.
('71', 86, 3, 7, 176300) I have had three cables from London shown to me asking for my opinion.
('71', 86, 3, 8, 176371) Friends in Madras too have pressed for its publication.
('71', 86, 3, 9, 176427) Though it is departure from my self imposed rule, I can no longer withstand the pressure especially as I am the sole author of the office acceptance clause of the Congress resolution 1 and the originator of the idea of attaching a condition to office acceptance.
('71', 86, 3, 10, 176690) My desire was not to lay down any impossible condition.
('71', 86, 3, 11, 176746) On the contrary, I wanted to devise a condition that could be easily accepted by the Governors.
('71', 86, 3, 12, 176842) There was no intention whatsoever to lay down a condition whose acceptance would mean any the slightest abrogation of the Constitution.
('71', 86, 3, 13, 176978) Congressmen were well aware that they could not and would not ask for any such amendment.
('71', 86, 3, 14, 177068) The Congress policy was and is not to secure an amendment, but an absolute ending of the Constitution which nobody likes.
('71', 86, 3, 15, 177190) Congressmen were and are also aware that they could not end it by mere acceptance of office, even conditional.
('71', 86, 3, 16, 177301) The object of that section of the Congress which believed in office acceptance was, pending the creation, by means consistent with the Congress creed of non violence, of a situation that would transfer all power to the people, to work the offices so as to strengthen the Congress which has been shown predominantly to represent mass opinion.
('71', 86, 3, 17, 177643) I felt that this object could not be secured unless there was a gentlemanly understanding between the Governors and their Congress Ministers that they would not exercise their special powers of

('71', 87, 0, 1, 177887) 88 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 87, 1, 2, 177928) interference so long as the Ministers acted within the Constitution.
('71', 87, 1, 3, 177997) Not to do so would be to court an almost immediate deadlock after entering upon office.
('71', 87, 1, 4, 178085) I felt that honesty demanded that under standing.
('71', 87, 1, 5, 178135) It is common cause that the Governors have discretionary powers.
('71', 87, 1, 6, 178200) Surely there was nothing extra constitutional in their saying that they would not exercise their discretion against Ministers carrying on constitutional activities.
('71', 87, 1, 7, 178365) It may be remembered that the understanding was not to touch the numerous other safeguards over which the Governors had no power.
('71', 87, 1, 8, 178495) A strong party with the decisive backing of the electorate could not be expected to put itself in the precarious position of being in dread of interference at the will of the Governors.
('71', 87, 1, 9, 178681) The question may be put in another way.
('71', 87, 1, 10, 178721) Should the Governors be courteous to the Ministers or discourteous?
('71', 87, 1, 11, 178789) I hold that it would be distinctly discourteous if they interfered with their Ministers in matters over which law gave the latter full control and with which the Governors were under no legal obligation to interfere.
('71', 87, 1, 12, 179006) A self respecting Minister conscious of an absolute majority at his back could not but demand the assurance of non interference.
('71', 87, 1, 13, 179135) Have I not heard Sir Samuel Hoare 1 and other Ministers saying in so many words that ordinarily the Governors would not use their admittedly large powers of interference?
('71', 87, 1, 14, 179306) I claim that the Congress formula has asked for nothing more.
('71', 87, 1, 15, 179368) It has been claimed on behalf of the British Government that the Act gives autonomy to the Provinces.
('71', 87, 1, 16, 179470) If that is so, it is not the Governors but the Ministers who are during their period of office responsible for the wise adminstration of their Provinces.
('71', 87, 1, 17, 179624) Responsible Ministers sensible of their duty could not submit to interference in the pursuance of their daily duty.
('71', 87, 1, 18, 179740) It does therefore appear to me that once more the British Government has broken to the heart what it has promised to the ear.
('71', 87, 1, 19, 179866) I doubt not that they can and will impose their will on the people till the latter develop enough strength from within to resist it, but that cannot be called working provincial autonomy.
('71', 87, 1, 20, 180054) By flouting the majority obtained through the machinery of their creation, they have in plain language ended the autonomy which they claim the Constitution has given to the Provinces.
('71', 87, 1, 21, 180238) The rule

('71', 88, 1, 2, 180327) therefore will now be the rule of the sword, not of the pen, nor of the indisputable majority.
('71', 88, 1, 3, 180422) Anyway that is the only interpretation which with all the goodwill in the world, I can put upon Government action.
('71', 88, 1, 4, 180537) For I believe in the cent per cent honesty of my formula whose acceptance might have prevented a crisis and resulted in a natural, orderly and peaceful transference of power from the bureaucracy to the largest and fullest democracy known to the world.

('71', 88, 3, 7, 180864) MY DEAR IDIOT, This is being written in the moving train.
('71', 88, 3, 8, 180922) You must have had the letter I asked Mahadev to write to you.
('71', 88, 3, 9, 180984) In Madras I had no time for anything but the work before me.
('71', 88, 3, 10, 181045) And I worked to the breaking point.
('71', 88, 3, 11, 181081) The reason was a discovery of great impurity in the Secretary of the SabhaPandit Harihar Sharma.
('71', 88, 3, 12, 181178) Ammu Swaminathan was not in Madras.
('71', 88, 3, 13, 181214) You did well in sending me the wire about your foot for your letter was alarming.
('71', 88, 3, 14, 181296) I hope you are now completly free.
('71', 88, 3, 15, 181331) You should discover the cause of it.
('71', 88, 3, 16, 181368) Yes, I would like you to give up even the spoonful of dal and equally give up vegetable or anything cooked or fried in ghee or oil.
('71', 88, 3, 17, 181500) I know you do not touch oil.
('71', 88, 3, 18, 181529) Do take raw onion with raw garlic, tomatoes and some green leaf.
('71', 88, 3, 19, 181594) Increase the quantity of milk.
('71', 88, 3, 20, 181625) If you have a good cow, once during the day try raw milk.
('71', 88, 3, 21, 181683) I evidently forgot to send you Dinshaw Mehtas address.
('71', 88, 3, 22, 181738) It is Dr. Dinshaw Mehta, Healthatorium, near City Station, Poona City.
('71', 88, 3, 23, 181809) Did you ever get from him the steaming kettle?
('71', 88, 3, 24, 181856) I have asked him to send it to you per V. P. P. Jullundur City address.
('71', 88, 3, 25, 181928) Heat has commenced in these parts.
('71', 88, 3, 26, 181963) But it is not unbearable as yet.
('71', 88, 3, 27, 181996) Mira says they had a bad storm in my absence.
('71', 88, 3, 28, 182042) Wardha weather seems to have changed.

('71', 89, 4, 12, 182683) Navin had come to Madras.
('71', 89, 4, 13, 182709) Paparamma 1 also had come.
('71', 89, 4, 14, 182736) But Saraswati could not.
('71', 89, 4, 15, 182761) The work in Madras was quite heavy.
('71', 89, 4, 16, 182797) Do you know Kamalabai of Madras who was doing publicity work?
('71', 89, 4, 17, 182859) She is here.
('71', 89, 4, 18, 182872) Anna 2 has fallen with her.
('71', 89, 4, 19, 182900) So for the time being she has to give up publicity work 3. Most probably she and Gomatibehn will stay with me.
('71', 89, 4, 20, 183011) I will test her then.
('71', 89, 4, 21, 183033) A man falls if he is a little careless.
('71', 89, 4, 22, 183073) You dont have to think much about staying with Mridula.
('71', 89, 4, 23, 183129) When you get sufficient self confidence to be able to work in Bihar independently, you can take up such work.
('71', 89, 4, 24, 183239) If you have such self confidence now, you neednt go to Mridula.
('71', 89, 4, 25, 183303) There is, thus, nothing to worry about.
('71', 89, 4, 26, 183343) If one does thework that comes to one unsought, without worrying about things and with single minded attention, one is bound to be at peace with oneself.

('71', 90, 3, 5, 183777) I wrote 1 yesterday but forgot to tell you that when I saw the cartoon 2 I felt what you felt.
('71', 90, 3, 6, 183872) The joke was quite innocent.
('71', 90, 3, 7, 183901) Only a suspicious mind could find a sinister purpose behind the cartoon.
('71', 90, 3, 8, 183974) But the suspicion is there and has to be taken account of.
('71', 90, 3, 9, 184033) Therefore you were wholly right in drawing Devdass attention to the cartoon.

('71', 90, 3, 13, 184281) You will tell me if this reaches you earlier.

('71', 91, 1, 12, 186083) You must have exercise in the fresh air.

('71', 91, 5, 25, 186681) Even when I wrote them, it resulted in considerable harm and the Arya Samaj suffered some injustice.

('71', 92, 3, 4, 187268) BRIJKRISHNA, I got your letter yesterday on my return from Madras.
('71', 92, 3, 5, 187335) It is unworthy of you to hold that I discourage you from joining me because of your faults: moreover, it is unjust to me.
('71', 92, 3, 6, 187457) I have forbidden you from coming simply because I think living with me would be an idle waste of time.
('71', 92, 3, 7, 187560) But if you have no peace otherwise, you may certainly come here and stay as long as you deem it fit.
('71', 92, 3, 8, 187661) What would happen if your health suffered?
('71', 92, 3, 9, 187704) Even this point may be overlooked for the time being.
('71', 92, 3, 10, 187758) This much then for your living with me.
('71', 92, 3, 11, 187798) Now for your predicament.
('71', 92, 3, 12, 187824) I think you should get married.
('71', 92, 3, 13, 187856) There is no grave error attached to marrying; every widower does it, which is certainly better than continually harbouring lustful thoughts.
('71', 92, 3, 14, 187997) It is difficult to pronounce any opinion on wealth.
('71', 92, 3, 15, 188049) I would only say this much that even the earning of wealth can be a mode of service, and in that too some ethical restraints must be observed and the prescribed rule should be applied to money making and the wealth should be as far as possible used for the benefit of society.
('71', 92, 3, 16, 188326) Your anguish increases as you try to work beyond your strength.
('71', 92, 3, 17, 188390) Ethics should not be misinterpreted in any way.

('71', 93, 5, 22, 190123) BAPA, You did very very well in writing to me.
('71', 93, 5, 23, 190170) Your letter came to me as a surprise.
('71', 93, 5, 24, 190208) I had a talk with Malkani, though Ghanshyamdas had asked me not to tell him, and suggested to him to be ready to leave Harijan Niwas.
('71', 93, 5, 25, 190342) I then informed Ghanshyamdas.
('71', 93, 5, 26, 190372) Of course I made it clear that I did not find Malkanis work altogether useless, but that there would be no difficulty at all in removing him.
('71', 93, 5, 27, 190514) He then said he was himself doubtful but he would see and think over it.
('71', 93, 5, 28, 190587) I am sending your letter to him.
('71', 93, 5, 29, 190620) I am not insisting at all [on keeping him].
('71', 93, 5, 30, 190664) You also may discuss the matter with him.

('71', 94, 3, 6, 190915) If his leaving brings greater benefit to the Harijan Niwas it is our duty promptly to remove him from there.

('71', 94, 7, 11, 191154) On the 26th ultimo there was the convocation of the Hindi Prachar University for giving certificates to those young men and women who had passed its final examination.
('71', 94, 7, 12, 191322) I was invited 1 to present the certificates to the graduates.
('71', 94, 7, 13, 191384) They had to take a threefold vow which pledged them to the spread of Hindi Hindustani, service of the motherland and personal purity for the good name of the University.
('71', 94, 7, 14, 191554) I drew the special attention of the graduates to the last two parts of the pledge.
('71', 94, 7, 15, 191637) The authors of the pledge, however, had a special intention in inserting the clauses about service and personal purity.
('71', 94, 7, 16, 191757) They were evidently of opinion that if the young men and women who passed through the institution spread Hindi in the spirit of service, and if their personal purity was assured, these two factors would enhance the prestige of the graduates and they would themselves be the best advertising media for popularizing Hindi Hindustani.
('71', 94, 7, 17, 192089) I therefore reminded them of the pledge that they had just taken.
('71', 94, 7, 18, 192155) In order to enforce my argument, I quoted to the graduates the instance of the reported fall of a Hindi teacher who had already damaged the cause of Hindi prachar.
('71', 94, 7, 19, 192319) When I referred to this report I had little thought of what was in store for me.
('71', 94, 7, 20, 192400) For the morning following I had a letter placed in my hands giving detailed information of the fall from purity of Pandit Harihar

('71', 95, 1, 2, 192642) Sharma, 1 the prime author of the pledge and the Secretary of the Sabha.
('71', 95, 1, 3, 192715) He is also a member of the Satyagraha Ashram from its foundation.
('71', 95, 1, 4, 192781) He and his wife qualified themselves for Hindi prachar work.
('71', 95, 1, 5, 192842) He has been for years the soul of the Hindi movement in the South.
('71', 95, 1, 6, 192909) At the Ashram he was held in high esteem.
('71', 95, 1, 7, 192951) He was easily among those who were always regarded above suspicion, above reproach.
('71', 95, 1, 8, 193035) I could not therefore believe the letter.
('71', 95, 1, 9, 193077) I spoke to him the next morning; and though he resisted the imputation for a while, the concealment became too unbearable for him and he confessed everything.
('71', 95, 1, 10, 193236) According to the Ashram code he gave me permission to refer to the sin in public.
('71', 95, 1, 11, 193318) I at once broke the news to the executive.
('71', 95, 1, 12, 193361) They were unprepared for the stunning news.
('71', 95, 1, 13, 193405) Pandit Sharma tendered resignation on the ground of the fall.
('71', 95, 1, 14, 193467) The executive will have accepted the resignation and the administration will have been overhauled.
('71', 95, 1, 15, 193566) Kakasaheb stayed in Madras to advise the executive of the Hindi Prachar Sabha.
('71', 95, 1, 16, 193645) But for me the matter does not end there.
('71', 95, 1, 17, 193687) It may be thought that events like this do not need publicity.
('71', 95, 1, 18, 193750) Those who think so evidently do not know the full facts.
('71', 95, 1, 19, 193807) The institution with which I am intimately connected have to deal with masses of mankind, both men and women.
('71', 95, 1, 20, 193917) They work through hundreds of volunteers.
('71', 95, 1, 21, 193959) These have no authority but the moral.
('71', 95, 1, 22, 193998) The volunteer workers inspire confidence because purity of personal life is assumed about them.
('71', 95, 1, 23, 194094) Their influence will wane immediately they lose credit for purity.
('71', 95, 1, 24, 194161) Publicity has never harmed the institutions or the persons involved in sin.
('71', 95, 1, 25, 194237) It behoves the workers throughout India to learn the lesson from Pandit Sharmas fall that they must be ever watchful of themselves and not be found napping and unready to resist when the enemy assails them.
('71', 95, 1, 26, 194444) This remark applies perhaps with greater force to Hindi teachers in the South than to others.
('71', 95, 1, 27, 194538) There is no purdah there.
('71', 95, 1, 28, 194564) Girls there have been found to be more interested in Hindi than boys.
('71', 95, 1, 29, 194634) Teachers by reason of their very occupation exercise over their pupils a moral authority which disarms suspicion and creates a confidence which would ordinarily be wanting.
('71', 95, 1, 30, 194807) Indeed a suggestion has already been made to the effect that in order to be fool proof the Hindi Prachar Sabha should stop private

('71', 96, 1, 2, 195024) tuition of girls altogether.
('71', 96, 1, 3, 195053) I have not been able to subscribe to the view.
('71', 96, 1, 4, 195100) Lapses will take place no matter how careful one is.
('71', 96, 1, 5, 195153) There cannot, therefore, be overcarefulness.
('71', 96, 1, 6, 195198) But to stop private tuition of girls is to admit moral bankruptcy.
('71', 96, 1, 7, 195265) There is no warrant for panic.
('71', 96, 1, 8, 195296) So far as I know, the Hindi teachers in general have done their work without blemish in the matter of personal purity.
('71', 96, 1, 9, 195415) I have not suppressed from the public any proved lapses.
('71', 96, 1, 10, 195472) We may not invite temptations nor may we shut ourselves in iron cages in order to avoid them altogether.
('71', 96, 1, 11, 195577) We must be prepared to face them when they come uninvited.
('71', 96, 1, 12, 195636) Sharma fell because he invited temptation.
('71', 96, 1, 13, 195679) He trusted himself too much.
('71', 96, 1, 14, 195708) Let the public that is interested in Hindi prachar work not be curious about the future of Pandit Sharma or about the details of his error.
('71', 96, 1, 15, 195848) He will be with me whilst he is reforming himself.
('71', 96, 1, 16, 195899) His disappearance from the organization does not mean the close of a career of service.
('71', 96, 1, 17, 195987) Indeed if this fall has taught him the lesson of his life, he will have lost nothing nor Hindi prachar a worker of his calibre.
('71', 96, 1, 18, 196115) To err is human, to own up ones error and to so act as to be proof against it is manly.
('71', 96, 1, 19, 196203) Let us hope that he has the manly quality necessary for the task and pray that he may become a better servant for the fall.

('71', 96, 3, 23, 196434) Fourteen highly educated Indian Christians occupying impor tant social positions have issued a joint manifesto setting forth their views on the missionary work among Harijans.
('71', 96, 3, 24, 196610) The document has been published in the Indian Press.
('71', 96, 3, 25, 196663) I was disinclined to publish it in Harijan, as after having read it more than once I could not bring myself to say anything in its favour and I felt that a critical review of it might serve no useful purpose.
('71', 96, 3, 26, 196872) But I understand that my criticism is expected and will be welcomed no matter how candid and strong it may be.
('71', 96, 3, 27, 196983) The reader will find the manifesto published in full in this issue.
('71', 96, 3, 28, 197051) The heading 1 is also the authors.They seem to have fallen between

('71', 97, 1, 2, 197441) two stools in their attempt to sit on both.
('71', 97, 1, 3, 197485) They have tried to reconcile the irreconcilable.
('71', 97, 1, 4, 197534) If one section of Christians has been aggressively open and militant, the other represented by the authors of the manifesto is courteously patronizing.
('71', 97, 1, 5, 197686) They would not be aggressive for the sake of expedience.
('71', 97, 1, 6, 197743) The purpose of the manifesto is not to condemn unequivocally the method of converting the illiterate and the ignorant but to assert the right of preaching the Gospel to the millions of Harijans.
('71', 97, 1, 7, 197938) The key to the manifesto is contained in paragraphs 7 and 8. This is what one reads in paragraph 7:
('71', 97, 2, 8, 198038) Men and women individually and in family or village groups will continue to seek the fellowship of the Christian Chruch.
('71', 97, 2, 9, 198159) That is the real movement of the Spirit of God.
('71', 97, 2, 10, 198207) And no power on earth can stem that tide.
('71', 97, 2, 11, 198249) It will be the duty of the Christian Church in India to receive such seekers after the truth as it is in Jesus Christ and provide for them instruction and spiritual nurture.
('71', 97, 2, 12, 198423) The Church will cling to its right to receive such people into itself from whatever religious group they may come.
('71', 97, 2, 13, 198538) It will cling to the further right to go about in these days of irreligion and materialism to awaken spiritual hunger in all.
('71', 97, 2, 14, 198664) These few sentences are striking instance of how the wish becomes father to the thought.
('71', 97, 2, 15, 198753) It is an unconscious process but not on that account less open to criticism.
('71', 97, 2, 16, 198830) Men and women do not seek the fellowship of the Christian Church.
('71', 97, 2, 17, 198896) Poor Harijans are no better than the others.
('71', 97, 2, 18, 198941) I wish they had real spiritual hunger.
('71', 97, 2, 19, 198980) Such as it is, they satisfy by visits to the temples, however crude they may be.
('71', 97, 2, 20, 199061) When the missionary of another religion goes to them, he goes like any vendor of goods.
('71', 97, 2, 21, 199149) He has no special spiritual merit that will distinguish him from those to whom he goes.
('71', 97, 2, 22, 199237) He does, however, possess material goods which he promises to those who will come to his fold.
('71', 97, 2, 23, 199332) Then mark, the duty of the Christian Church in India turns into a right.
('71', 97, 2, 24, 199405) Now when duty becomes a right it ceases to be a duty.
('71', 97, 2, 25, 199459) Performance of a duty requires one qualitythat of suffering and introspection.
('71', 97, 2, 26, 199538) Exercise of a right requires a quality that gives the power to impose ones will upon the resister through sanctions devised by the claimant or the law whose aid he invokes in the exercise of his right.
('71', 97, 2, 27, 199740) I have the duty of paying my debt, but I have no right to thrust the owed coppers (say) into the pocket of an unwilling creditor.
('71', 97, 2, 28, 199870) The duty of taking spiritual message is performed by the messenger becoming a fit vehicle by prayer and fasting.
('71', 97, 2, 29, 199983) Conceived as a right, it may easily become an imposition on unwilling parties.
('71', 97, 2, 30, 200062) Thus the manifesto, undoubtedly designed to allay suspicion and soothe the ruffled feelings of Hindus, in my opinion, fails to accomplish its purpose.
('71', 97, 2, 31, 200213) On the contrary, it leaves a bad taste in the

('71', 98, 1, 2, 200301) I venture to suggest to the authors that they need to re examine their position in the light of my remarks.
('71', 98, 1, 3, 200409) Let them recognize the fundamental difference between rights and duties.
('71', 98, 1, 4, 200482) In the spiritual sphere, there is no such thing as a right.

('71', 98, 3, 7, 200599) The secretary of a goshala writes: 1
('71', 98, 4, 8, 200636) It is my firm belief that by making good use of the hide of a dead animal religion is not violated, nor should sanatanist Hindus feel offended over this.
('71', 98, 4, 9, 200790) Yes, it is certainly a lapse of religion if full use of the hide of a dead animal is not made because it increases cow slaughter.
('71', 98, 4, 10, 200920) The price of a cow decreases day by day and so cows are easily sold and taken straight to slaughter houses.
('71', 98, 4, 11, 201028) If we consider goseva as an inseparable part of Hindu religion, we can neither look down upon the tanners profession nor consider them untouchable.
('71', 98, 4, 12, 201176) The cow dies solely from our ignorance.
('71', 98, 4, 13, 201216) Dharma cannot be protected by merely talking about it; that can be done only by understanding the meaning of the Shastras and by practising it.
('71', 98, 4, 14, 201360) I have written several times that if the goshalas in India know their duty and adhere to it faithfully, then cow slaughter can be done away with and cows milk will be easily available to everyone.
('71', 98, 4, 15, 201557) There is no exaggeration of any kind in this statement.
('71', 98, 4, 16, 201613) Almost all cows are owned by Hindus.
('71', 98, 4, 17, 201650) If they adhere to their dharma and refrain from selling cows which is the cause of cow slaughter, there can be no cow slaughter.
('71', 98, 4, 18, 201779) Let every goshala become an ideal dairy, that is, self reliant, and let experts on dairying and animal husbandry work in it.
('71', 98, 4, 19, 201904) A self reliant goshala must prosper from day to day.
('71', 98, 4, 20, 201957) It can also make proper use of the hides of the dead cattle.
('71', 98, 4, 21, 202018) This amounts to saying that with the increase in cattle wealth, our knowledge will also grow; and this will be a great help to us in reducing unemployment in the country.
('71', 98, 4, 22, 202189) Even if one goshala will accomplish this task, other goshalas will follow it.

('71', 98, 5, 24, 202304) 1 The letter is not translated here.
('71', 98, 5, 25, 202341) The correspondent had said that till then the practice of the goshala was to give away dead cattle without any charge.
('71', 98, 5, 26, 202460) However, in that year they had had the hides removed and sold, which had resulted in great dissatisfaction among orthodox Hindus.

('71', 99, 7, 18, 203323) I have removed the paragraph about bread making.
('71', 99, 7, 19, 203372) It is trivial.
('71', 99, 7, 20, 203387) Otherwise it is readable though it still does not answer the picture I drew of an ideal report.

('71', 100, 3, 6, 204262) Shankerrao is not of the School.

('71', 100, 7, 14, 204509) Your eyes must have been completely cured.
('71', 100, 7, 15, 204552) There was nothing in the Bharatiya [Sahitya] Parishad 1 to make it a success.

('71', 101, 6, 9, 205911) The matter should be finalized.
('71', 101, 6, 10, 205943) The Governors say that the condition demanded by Congress leaders is not in conformity with the Reforms Act.
('71', 101, 6, 11, 206052) Have you examined what legal validity their objection has?
('71', 101, 6, 12, 206111) If you feel that what the Governors say is right, then you will have to convince me.
('71', 101, 6, 13, 206196) If you think that the Governors could have accepted the Congress condition without violating the Act, you ought to publish that opinion under the signatures of some good lawyers there.
('71', 101, 6, 14, 206381) Please attend to this urgently.

('71', 101, 11, 22, 206690) It is good that you have begun with butter.
('71', 101, 11, 23, 206734) Ultimately you will have to begin with milk and I have no objection if you do so.
('71', 101, 11, 24, 206816) I have to some extent even put into practice what I am thinking at present.
('71', 101, 11, 25, 206892) You will know more when I can implement all the ideas.

('71', 102, 5, 7, 207327) What has been done regarding Hindi Hindustani has been well done.
('71', 102, 5, 8, 207393) A start should certainly be made towards putting into effect the statement that has been issued.
('71', 102, 5, 9, 207490) The suggestion about a conference is good but in the atmosphere that prevails I have some doubt about its success.
('71', 102, 5, 10, 207605) But what can one do about it?
('71', 102, 5, 11, 207635) Success is bound to come sooner or later if we make the effort.
('71', 102, 5, 12, 207699) So you must continue your endeavours as and when you find the opportunity.
('71', 102, 5, 13, 207774) There is no cause for worry on account of my health.

('71', 102, 8, 16, 207963) I still maintain my objection to Kamaladevi.
('71', 102, 8, 17, 208008) You can have Mridula instead if you want two women.
('71', 102, 8, 18, 208060) There must be other women in the A.I.C.C. Maulana would remain if pressed.
('71', 102, 8, 19, 208135) I would like Jamnalalji to be spared.
('71', 102, 8, 20, 208173) But that is a matter between you, Rajen Babu and him.
('71', 102, 8, 21, 208227) I do not mind too many from U.P. You cant help it.
('71', 102, 8, 22, 208278) I take it you will discuss the list with those whom you want to retain.
('71', 102, 8, 23, 208350) I cant think of anyone else or anything else.

('71', 103, 1, 2, 208991) I think I told you that I used to like her.
('71', 103, 1, 3, 209035) Her ability is unquestioned.
('71', 103, 1, 4, 209064) But I have known things which have worried me about her.
('71', 103, 1, 5, 209121) I should unhesitatingly take Sarup 1. But I can understand the delicacy.
('71', 103, 1, 6, 209194) Satyavati deserves the place apart from her fanaticism which makes her sometimes a dangerous ally.
('71', 103, 1, 7, 209293) You may show my objection to Kamaladevi if you know her sufficiently.
('71', 103, 1, 8, 209363) For I do not say this behind her back.
('71', 103, 1, 9, 209402) I believe she knows my opinion.
('71', 103, 1, 10, 209434) It hurts me to hold that opinion, but how can I help myself?
('71', 103, 1, 11, 209495) There fore let not my opinion weigh with you unduly.
('71', 103, 1, 12, 209548) If those whom you want do not object, you should have her.
('71', 103, 1, 13, 209607) Of course I am partial to Mridula.
('71', 103, 1, 14, 209642) But Satyavati has a longer record of service and has from a public point of view a better right.
('71', 103, 1, 15, 209739) Mridula is a brick so far as work and loyalty are concerned.
('71', 103, 1, 16, 209800) She will be the youngest member, if the choice falls on her.
('71', 103, 1, 17, 209861) If I had to make the selection of course the choice will be Satyavati almost for the reasons that make you exclude Sarup.

('71', 103, 4, 28, 210453) You should persevere as you have begun.
('71', 103, 4, 29, 210493) I am stupid at remembering things.
('71', 103, 4, 30, 210528) You will now have to bear the burden of my forgetfulness.

('71', 104, 6, 19, 211675) The dishonesty of their argument is transparent.
('71', 104, 6, 20, 211724) It has acerbated almost every Indian whose opinion counts.
('71', 104, 6, 21, 211783) Bhulabhais is a lawyers opinion.
('71', 104, 6, 22, 211816) This autonomy is still born.

('71', 105, 2, 3, 212490) Unrevised April 5, 1937
('71', 105, 3, 4, 212514) MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL, Why should you become ill?
('71', 105, 3, 5, 212561) Having become ill, why will you not give yourself rest?
('71', 105, 3, 6, 212617) I thought you were going to steal away somewhere after Indu came.
('71', 105, 3, 7, 212683) Please give my love to her when she arrives.
('71', 105, 3, 8, 212728) I must send her a line with this.
('71', 105, 3, 9, 212762) Now about your grouse.
('71', 105, 3, 10, 212785) Somehow or other everything I say and even perhaps do jars on you.
('71', 105, 3, 11, 212852) Silence was impossible.
('71', 105, 3, 12, 212876) I thought in the context the words courtesy and discourtesy came out all right.
('71', 105, 3, 13, 212956) Yours is the first note of complaint from the Congress side about the statement 1. I could not help myself if the complaint was universal.
('71', 105, 3, 14, 213095) I am glad you have written.
('71', 105, 3, 15, 213123) You must bear with me till my understanding becomes clear or your fears are dispelled.
('71', 105, 3, 16, 213210) I apprehend no harm from my statement.
('71', 105, 3, 17, 213249) Is there anything at the back of your mind that I do not understand?
('71', 105, 3, 18, 213318) Kamaladevi travelled with us from Wardha to Madras.
('71', 105, 3, 19, 213370) She was coming from Delhi.
('71', 105, 3, 20, 213397) She came to my compartment twice and had long chats.
('71', 105, 3, 21, 213450) At last she wanted to know why Sarojini Devi was excluded 2, why Laxmipati was being kept away by Rajaji, why Anasuyabai was excluded, and so on.
('71', 105, 3, 22, 213596) I then told her of my part in her exclusion, and told her almost all that [I] could remember of the note I wrote for you on that silent Monday.
('71', 105, 3, 23, 213740) Of course, I told her I had no hand in Sarojinis exclusion at first or inclusion after.
('71', 105, 3, 24, 213828) I told her also that Rajaji, so far as I knew, had nothing to do with Ls exclusion.
('71', 105, 3, 25, 213912) I thought you should know this.
('71', 105, 3, 26, 213944) I hope this will find you fully restored.

('71', 106, 8, 17, 214712) How can one have ones way in everything?

('71', 106, 8, 21, 214975) When life itself is short and extremely uncertain, what can we say of our activities?
('71', 106, 8, 22, 215061) Only dharma abides; it is imperishable because it is related to the atman.
('71', 106, 8, 23, 215136) And dharma lies in truth and ahimsa.
('71', 106, 8, 24, 215173) Whatever we do while following it is proper.
('71', 106, 8, 25, 215218) And what if, in doing it, we get daily something new to do or have to wander from place to place every day?
('71', 106, 8, 26, 215326) What difference does it make whether we have a broom in our hand or a pen?
('71', 106, 8, 27, 215401) We should be content with whatever comes to us unsought.
('71', 106, 8, 28, 215458) We should bring credit to whatever work we do.
('71', 106, 8, 29, 215505) Stay there as long as Father desires.
('71', 106, 8, 30, 215543) Go to Sitab Diyara if you think it necessary and to Ahmedabad when Jayaprakash permits you to do so.
('71', 106, 8, 31, 215644) Who would force you to stay on if you did not feel happy there?
('71', 106, 8, 32, 215708) I have written to Poona regarding Harijan.

('71', 109, 3, 4, 218990) BHAISHRI MUNSHI,
('71', 109, 4, 5, 219007) The performance of the Bharatiya Sahitya Parishad was nothing to be proud of.
('71', 109, 4, 6, 219085) And how could it be that you, the father of the Parishad, 1 did not attend?
('71', 109, 4, 7, 219161) I was only in the background and Kaka was busy at that very time with many other things.
('71', 109, 4, 8, 219250) In these circumstances, I feel that it is nothing but sinful to propose a big scheme.
('71', 109, 4, 9, 219336) Personally I would be ready to wind up the Parishad even on my own responsibility.
('71', 109, 4, 10, 219419) Or we should remain satisfied with whatever we three can achieve with our own sincere efforts.
('71', 109, 4, 11, 219514) I did not at all blame you for not being able to come to Madras.
('71', 109, 4, 12, 219579) Do invite suggestions regarding the consititution of Gujarat Sahitya Parishad.
('71', 109, 4, 13, 219658) Have you received any from those for whose satisfaction the committee is formed?
('71', 109, 4, 14, 219739) It would be better to announce a date for the meeting of the committee.

('71', 109, 9, 18, 219933) I got your letter.
('71', 109, 9, 19, 219952) I am replying to you at the Rajkot address.
('71', 109, 9, 20, 219996) Paparamma was not in a position to go to Belgaum.
('71', 109, 9, 21, 220046) Ramchandran is quite ill.
('71', 109, 9, 22, 220072) He had an attack of pleurisy.
('71', 109, 9, 23, 220102) He is better now but is taking rest.
('71', 109, 9, 24, 220139) His nerves also have become weak.
('71', 109, 9, 25, 220173) He did not permit Saraswati to come because he is still afraid that her studies may be disturbed.
('71', 109, 9, 26, 220271) It is surprising that your thumb is still not cured.
('71', 109, 9, 27, 220324) Did you try mud treatment?

('71', 110, 1, 2, 220670) it much easier to write.
('71', 110, 1, 3, 220695) I myself had tried a mud bandage as help in writing with the tired thumb, and I had been able to continue working.
('71', 110, 1, 4, 220810) Manu has spared you and so it will not be necessary for you to come to Belgaum just for the sake of the wedding.
('71', 110, 1, 5, 220923) But you probably know that Ba herself is coming there.
('71', 110, 1, 6, 220978) If, therefore, your stay there for a few days is likely to satisfy your aunts, you can come to Belgaum.
('71', 110, 1, 7, 221082) And from there you can go to Mysore.
('71', 110, 1, 8, 221119) If it can be arranged this way, you can be present at the wedding and, after the function at Belgaum is over, you can go to Mysore.
('71', 110, 1, 9, 221251) Devdass letter is all right.
('71', 110, 1, 10, 221280) I do not remember to have used the word strong, though I cannot say, either, that I didnt use it.
('71', 110, 1, 11, 221378) Even if I did, what is the harm?
('71', 110, 1, 12, 221411) Even if your desire is no more than a simple wish, there is no harm in satisfying it.
('71', 110, 1, 13, 221497) Going to Mysore should depend on your own will.
('71', 110, 1, 14, 221545) It should be enough if Devdas gives his consent.
('71', 110, 1, 15, 221594) If you do not wish, why should you go?
('71', 110, 1, 16, 221633) I am firm in my view.
('71', 110, 1, 17, 221655) I personally prefer Mysore to Bombay, both from the point of view of the climate and of peace of mind.
('71', 110, 1, 18, 221758) I do not know whether education there will be of the standard of Wilson College.
('71', 110, 1, 19, 221839) But according to me that depends more on the student.
('71', 110, 1, 20, 221893) I have come across many dullards educated in Wilson College and very intelligent Mysoreans who have never gone out of Mysore.
('71', 110, 1, 21, 222019) But the best course is that you should go to Mysore and see things for yourself and then decide as you like.

('71', 110, 5, 28, 222342) Can you see anybody who has no worries?
('71', 110, 5, 29, 222382) Everybody has some trouble or other.
('71', 110, 5, 30, 222419) Is even Jayaprakash at peace?
('71', 110, 5, 31, 222449) Is Jawaharlal?
('71', 110, 5, 32, 222464) Or Rajendra Babu?
('71', 110, 5, 33, 222482) What more worries have you than they?
('71', 110, 5, 34, 222520) Whether you stay with Father or with in laws or with me, everywhere you have to do service, havent you?
('71', 110, 5, 35, 222624) If you think that their cases are different in that they invite worries voluntarily, then even that is not proper.
('71', 110, 5, 36, 222739) They also have to submit to others wishes.
('71', 110, 5, 37, 222782) We are all dependent on others even as much as we are independent.
('71', 110, 5, 38, 222849) In fact you are very fortunate.
('71', 110, 5, 39, 222881) Stop worrying now.
('71', 110, 5, 40, 222900) As for going to Mridula, do as Jayaprakash says.

('71', 111, 6, 12, 223496) You are very ambitious.
('71', 111, 6, 13, 223520) If you wish to be successfulyou must improve your handwriting.

('71', 111, 6, 15, 223693) But the belief that one who is careless about little things can be careful about bigger things is a fallacy.
('71', 111, 6, 16, 223802) You are a worshipper of non violence.
('71', 111, 6, 17, 223840) Politeness is an integral part of non violence because impoliteness causes pain, politeness does not.
('71', 111, 6, 18, 223942) A boy who addresses his mother as his fathers wife is telling the truth but as his language is rude it is violent and is frowned upon in good society.

('71', 112, 1, 6, 225114) If so I would like you to translate literally one verse every day.
('71', 112, 1, 7, 225181) I am using both the translations you left for me.
('71', 112, 1, 8, 225231) None satisfies my taste.

('71', 116, 1, 2, 231747) 137. WONDERFUL IF TRUE
('71', 116, 2, 3, 231770) During our morning and evening walks, Khan Saheb Abdul Ghaffar Khan and I often talk on matters of common interest.
('71', 116, 2, 4, 231886) Having travelled in the Frontier territories as far as Kabul and beyond and knowing the Frontier tribes well, he often describes to me the habits and customs of these simple folk.
('71', 116, 2, 5, 232066) He tells me that these tribesmen who are untouched by the so called civilization live principally on maize and barley, bread and lentils supplemented at times by buttermilk.
('71', 116, 2, 6, 232240) They get meat but rarely.
('71', 116, 2, 7, 232266) The only way I could account for their well known hardiness was their open air life and invigorating climate.
('71', 116, 2, 8, 232376) Khan Saheb promptly added:
('71', 116, 3, 9, 232403) That is not enough.
('71', 116, 3, 10, 232423) The secret of their strength lies in their chaste lives.
('71', 116, 3, 11, 232480) They marry, both men and women, after full maturity.
('71', 116, 3, 12, 232533) Unfaithfulness, adultery or unmarried love are practically unknown.
('71', 116, 3, 13, 232601) Union out of wedlock is punishable by death.
('71', 116, 3, 14, 232646) The injured party has the right to take the life of the wrongdoer.
('71', 116, 3, 15, 232713) If this chastity is so universal as Khan Saheb describes it, it furnishes us in India a lesson that we should take to heart.
('71', 116, 3, 16, 232838) I suggested to Khan Saheb that if the fine physique of the tribesmen was largely due to their continence, there must be perfect co operation between the mind and the body.
('71', 116, 3, 17, 233010) For, if the mind hankered after satisfaction of the flesh and the body resisted, there must be tremendous waste of vital energy, leaving the body thoroughly exhausted.
('71', 116, 3, 18, 233178) Khan Saheb agreed that that was a fair deduction and that, so far as he was able to judge, he felt that the tribesmen were so habituated to continence outside marriage that young men and women never seemed to desire sexual satisfaction outside marriage.
('71', 116, 3, 19, 233432) Khan Saheb also told me that the women in the tribal areas never observed the purdah, there was no false prudery there, the women were fearless, roamed about anywhere freely, were well able to take care of themselves and defend their honour without seeking or needing male protection.
('71', 116, 3, 20, 233717) Khan Saheb, however, admits that this continence not being based on reason or enlightened faith breaks down when these men and women of the hills come in contact with civilized or soft life where departure from the custom carries no punishment and publicopinion looks upon unfaithfulness and adultery with more or less indifference.
('71', 116, 3, 21, 234050) This opens up reflections which I must not discuss just now.
('71', 116, 3, 22, 234111) My purpose in writing this just now is to seek corroboration and further light from those who know these tribesmen, as Khan Saheb does, and to suggest to young men and women of the plains that observance of continence, if it is really natural to the tribesmen, as Khan Saheb thinks it is, should be equally natural to us, if only we
('71', 117, 0, 1, 234444) 118 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 117, 1, 2, 234486) would inhabit our thought world with the right kind of thoughts and deal summarily with the intruders.
('71', 117, 1, 3, 234589) Indeed, if the right kind settle down in sufficiently large numbers, the intruders will be crowded out no doubt.
('71', 117, 1, 4, 234702) The process requires courage.
('71', 117, 1, 5, 234732) But self restraint never accrues to the faint hearted.
('71', 117, 1, 6, 234787) It is the beautiful fruit of watchfulness and ceaseless effort in the form of prayer and fasting.
('71', 117, 1, 7, 234885) The prayer is not vain repetition nor fasting mere starvation of the body.
('71', 117, 1, 8, 234960) Prayer has to come from the heart which knows God by faith, and fasting is abstinence from evil or injurious thought, activity or food.
('71', 117, 1, 9, 235096) Starvation of the body when the mind thinks of a multiplicity of dishes is worse than useless.

('71', 117, 3, 12, 235245) In all other parts of India where swadeshi exhibitions permitting mill cloth are held the A. I. S. A. has as a rule refused to exhibit khadi.
('71', 117, 3, 13, 235387) And the rule has answered the purpose for which it was framed.
('71', 117, 3, 14, 235450) From U.P., however, the pressure has come to relax the rule.
('71', 117, 3, 15, 235511) But I have hitherto resisted the temptation.
('71', 117, 3, 16, 235556) U.P. khadi workers made a special reference for their guidance.
('71', 117, 3, 17, 235620) They are almost all Congressmen no less ardent than the others, but they have dedicated themselves to the Congress service through its constructive and the most difficult programme, khadi.
('71', 117, 3, 18, 235809) Appreciating their difficulty I referred the question to Shri Jawaharlal Nehru for his opinion.
('71', 117, 3, 19, 235905) I have received the following reply 1 from him:
('71', 117, 4, 20, 235953) I have your letter of the 5th March enquiring about khadi at exhibitions.
('71', 117, 4, 21, 236027) This matter has been repeatedly discussed by us in the course of the past year ever since my return from Europe.
('71', 117, 5, 22, 236140) The question you have put is not easy to answer.
('71', 117, 5, 23, 236189) The average khadi worker seems to be of opinion that khadi should not be exhibited if mill cloth is allowed there.
('71', 117, 5, 24, 236304) Other Congress workers are usually of a contrary opinion on the ground that at such exhibitions there is usually a good sale of khadi.
('71', 117, 5, 25, 236439) Obviously the opinion of the khadi worker, who is presumed to be an expert at his job and who is anxious to push khadi, should be almost final.
('71', 117, 5, 26, 236583) I would therefore hesitate to give my decision against him unless I succeed in convincing him.
('71', 117, 5, 27, 236678) I imagine that from a certain long distance view it is better even to incur some loss now so as to avoid producing any confusion in the public mind as to what khadi is and what it is not.
('71', 117, 5, 28, 236866) This can only be done by

('71', 118, 0, 1, 236928) VOL.71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 119
('71', 118, 1, 2, 236971) adherence to the present policy of banning certified khadi sales in such exhibitions.
('71', 118, 1, 3, 237057) At the same time, I find that uncertified khadi is sold at such exhibitions and plenty of people patronize it.
('71', 118, 1, 4, 237168) There are quite large numbers of people as you know who are not particularly keen on buying certified khadi, but who are prepared to do so if it comes their way.
('71', 118, 1, 5, 237330) The point is: are we to cater for the people in any especial measure, or are we to concentrate on holding fast to those who desire to use pure khadi only?
('71', 118, 1, 6, 237485) This question has not only its business side but its psychological side.
('71', 118, 1, 7, 237558) Khadi has on the one hand built up a firm foundation for itself, and there is a body of men in the country who must have pure khadi whatever the cost or the trouble.
('71', 118, 1, 8, 237724) At the same time khadi does not spread as rapidly as it might among other classes who only occasionally patronize it.
('71', 118, 1, 9, 237842) For khadi workers the object should be to develop the khadi habit in the latter.
('71', 118, 1, 10, 237923) That habit comes largely from appeals, to the mind or heart and partly from sheer habit.
('71', 118, 1, 11, 238012) Ordinarily speaking, it would be a good thing to have as many casual purchasers as possible so that they may get used to buying and wearing khadi and thus develop the real habit.
('71', 118, 1, 12, 238191) The present policy to some extent keeps away this casual purchaser and thus reduces the field from which regular khadi buyers might be drawn.
('71', 118, 1, 13, 238333) Therefore, if you want my final opinion, I cannot give it very definitely, and because of my not being definite I must respect the opinions of others who are working for khadi.
('71', 118, 1, 14, 238510) I am, however, inclined to think that it might be preferable to allow khadi to be exhibited and sold in these exhibitions under certain conditions which would prevent as far as possible (1) something else being mistaken for khadi and the distinction between khadi and mill cloth being clearly preserved (2) the exclusion of partly foreign stuffs from the exhibition.
('71', 118, 1, 15, 238877) In the absence of final opinion which he is unable to give, he would respect the opinions of others who are working for khadi.
('71', 118, 1, 16, 239004) He is, however, inclined to think that it might be preferable to allow khadi to be exhibited and sold in these exhibitions. My own experience, however, tells me that it is dangerous to befog the mass mind by putting khadi in juxtaposition with the gaudy mill made cloth.
('71', 118, 1, 17, 239275) It is very like putting human beings side by side with robots.
('71', 118, 1, 18, 239338) Human beings may be worsted in the competition if they allow themselves to be compared to robots.
('71', 118, 1, 19, 239436) Even so will khadi fare, in comparision with mill made cloth.
('71', 118, 1, 20, 239498) The planes of the two are different.
('71', 118, 1, 21, 239535) The aims are opposite.
('71', 118, 1, 22, 239558) Khadi gives work to all, mill cloth gives work to some and deprives many of honest labour.
('71', 118, 1, 23, 239649) Khadi serves the masses, mill cloth is intended to serve the classes.
('71', 118, 1, 24, 239719) Khadi serves labour, mill cloth exploits it.
('71', 118, 1, 25, 239764) My experience is backed by that of the khadi workers throughout

('71', 119, 3, 4, 240129) WARDHA, April 10, 1937 I have read Lord Lothians appeal 1 to me with the respect it deserves.
('71', 119, 3, 5, 240223) I have a vivid recollection of the talks with him among other friends.
('71', 119, 3, 6, 240294) The provincial autonomy then pictured was a real stuff unlike what the present Constitution is supposed to give.
('71', 119, 3, 7, 240407) Lord Zetlands elaborate statement 2 confirms my view and hardens the universal suspicion of the British statements intentions.
('71', 119, 3, 8, 240534) So long as they wish to bolster up imperialistic designs, India, which the Congress represents, will never reconcile itself to them.
('71', 119, 3, 9, 240667) I believe in friendship with Britain, not with imperialistic exploitation.
('71', 119, 3, 10, 240742) I am free to confess ignorance of the Government of India Act and a greater ignorance of the Select Committees Report.
('71', 119, 3, 11, 240861) My advice to the Congress to adopt my resolution on a conditional acceptance of office was based on an assurance of lawyers amongCongressmen that the Governors could give the required assurance without an infringement of the Act.
('71', 119, 3, 12, 241091) 3 I do not, therefore, need even Sir Samuel Hoares past declarations to support me.
('71', 119, 3, 13, 241175) If, therefore, he disclaims having ever made the statement which I aver having heard him make, I accept his disclaimer without argument.
('71', 119, 3, 14, 241312) The dismal fact stares India in the face that British statement imposed an Act on India against her declared wishes and then instead of leaving its interpretation to impartial tribunals impose their own upon her and call this transaction autonomy.
('71', 119, 3, 15, 241560) Lawyers, Mussalman, Parsi and Hindu, whom the Government have hitherto honoured with their partronage, declared that the Governors can without an infringement give the required assurance.
('71', 119, 3, 16, 241748) I regard the British statesmens interpretation as non judicial, arbitrary and interested.

('71', 120, 1, 2, 242091) At the same time I recognize that other lawyers give an interpretation favourable to the British Government.
('71', 120, 1, 3, 242200) Therefore I invite them to appoint an arbitration tribunal of three judges of whom one will be appointed by the Congress, another by the British Government with power to the two to appoint a third to decide whether it is competent for the Governors to give the required assurance described by me.
('71', 120, 1, 4, 242497) And since the legality of the present Ministries has been questioned, I would refer that question also to the proposed tribunal.
('71', 120, 1, 5, 242626) There is precedent for such a course.
('71', 120, 1, 6, 242664) If they would accept my proposal I would advise the Congress to do likewise.
('71', 120, 1, 7, 242741) I mean every word of my previous statement 1. I want right to prevail.
('71', 120, 1, 8, 242812) There is here no question of diplomacy with India.
('71', 120, 1, 9, 242863) It is a question of life and death.
('71', 120, 1, 10, 242899) Office will be accepted if only progress towards her goal is accepted, not otherwise.
('71', 120, 1, 11, 242985) It, therefore, pains me to find Lord Zetland playing upon the old familiar tune of divide and rule.
('71', 120, 1, 12, 243085) The Congress cannot exist for two days if it disregards the interests of minorities.
('71', 120, 1, 13, 243170) It cannot bring about mass rule by dividing India into factions.
('71', 120, 1, 14, 243235) The Congress Ministries, if they ever come into existence, will dig their own graves without the Governors safeguards the moment they trample upon the rights of the minorities or resort to injustice otherwise.
('71', 120, 1, 15, 243445) I regret to have to say it but, to be true, I must say that Lord Zetlands speech is that of one who is conscious of his sword rather than of his right.
('71', 120, 1, 16, 243597) His Lordship is again misleading when he says that the Congress wants to be treated as a privileged body.
('71', 120, 1, 17, 243703) It does not.
('71', 120, 1, 18, 243716) Anyone representing a most decisive majority like the Congress.
('71', 120, 1, 19, 243780) would want the gentlemanly assurance that the Congress has asked for.

('71', 121, 7, 10, 244469) 141. INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT OR DISSIPATION?
('71', 121, 8, 11, 244515) During my recent wanderings in Travancore and Madras I found that most of the students and intellectuals who came into touch with me were an instance of intellectual dissipation rather than intellectual development.
('71', 121, 8, 12, 244731) The fault lies in the modern system of education which encourages this vicious tendency, misdirects the mind, and thereby hinders its development instead of helping it.
('71', 121, 8, 13, 244900) My experiments in Segaon have only confirmed this impression.
('71', 121, 8, 14, 244962) But they are as yet too incomplete to be cited as evidence.
('71', 121, 8, 15, 245022) The views on education that I am now going to set forth have been held by me right from the time of the founding of the Phoenix settlement in South Africa in the year 1904.
('71', 121, 9, 16, 245195) I hold that true education of intellect can only come through a proper exercise and training of the bodily organs, e.g., hands, feet, eyes, ears, nose, etc.
('71', 121, 9, 17, 245352) In other words, an intelligent use of the bodily organs in a child provides the best and quickest way of developing his intellect.
('71', 121, 9, 18, 245483) But unless the development of the mind and body goes hand in hand with a corresponding awakening of the soul, the former alone would prove to be a poor lop sided affair.
('71', 121, 9, 19, 245653) By spiritual training I mean education of the heart.
('71', 121, 9, 20, 245706) A proper and all round development of the mind, therefore, can take place only when it proceeds pari passu with the education of the physical and spiritual faculties of the child.
('71', 121, 9, 21, 245886) They constitute an indivisible whole.
('71', 121, 9, 22, 245924) According to this theory, therefore, it would be a gross fallacy to suppose that they can be developed piecemeal or independently of one another.
('71', 121, 10, 23, 246070) 1 The Gujarati original of this appeared in Harijanbandhu, 11 4 1937. This is a translation by Pyarelal.
('71', 122, 0, 1, 246175) VOL.71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 123
('71', 122, 1, 2, 246218) The baneful effects of absence of proper co ordination and harmony among the various faculties of body, mind and soul respectively are obvious.
('71', 122, 1, 3, 246362) They are all around us; only we have lost perception of them owing to our present perverse associations.
('71', 122, 1, 4, 246467) Take the case of our village folk.
('71', 122, 1, 5, 246502) From their childhood upward they toil and labour in their fields from morning till night like their cattle in the midst of whom they live.
('71', 122, 1, 6, 246641) Their existence is a weary, endless round of mechanical drudgery unrelieved by a spark of intelligence or higher graces of life.
('71', 122, 1, 7, 246770) Deprived of all scope for developing their mind and soul, they have sunk to the level of the beast.
('71', 122, 1, 8, 246870) Life to them is a sorry bungle which they muddle through anyhow.
('71', 122, 1, 9, 246935) On the other hand what goes by the name of education in our schools and colleges in the cities today is in reality only intellectual dissipation.
('71', 122, 1, 10, 247081) Intellectual training is there looked upon as something altogether unrelated to manual or physical work.
('71', 122, 1, 11, 247186) But since the body must have some sort of physical exercise to keep it in health, they vainly try to attain that end by means of an artificial and otherwise barren system of physical culture which would be ridiculous beyond words if the result was not so tragic.
('71', 122, 1, 12, 247449) The young man who emerges from this system can in no way compete in physical endurance with an ordinary labourer.
('71', 122, 1, 13, 247563) The slightest physical exertion gives him headache; a mild exposure to the sun is enough to cause him giddiness.
('71', 122, 1, 14, 247676) And what is more, all this is looked upon as quite natural.
('71', 122, 1, 15, 247736) As for the faculties of the heart, they are simply allowed to run to seed or to grow anyhow in a wild undisciplined manner.
('71', 122, 1, 16, 247860) The result is moral and spiritual anarchy.
('71', 122, 1, 17, 247903) And it is regarded as something laudable!
('71', 122, 1, 18, 247945) As against this, take the case of a child in whom the education of the heart is attended to from the very beginning.
('71', 122, 1, 19, 248062) Supposing he is set to some useful occupation like spinning, carpentry, agriculture, etc., for his education and in that connection is given a thorough, comprehensive knowledge relating to the theory of the various operations that he is to perform and the use and construction of the tools that he would be wielding.
('71', 122, 1, 20, 248379) He would not only develop a fine, healthy body but also a sound, vigorous intellect that is not merely academic but is firmly rooted in and is tested from day to day by experience.
('71', 122, 1, 21, 248560) His intellectual education would include a knowledge of mathematics and the various sciences that are useful for an intelligent
('71', 123, 0, 1, 248688) 124 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 123, 1, 2, 248730) and efficient exercise of his avocation.
('71', 123, 1, 3, 248771) If to this is added literature by way of recreation, it would give him a perfect, well balanced, all round education in which the intellect, the body and the spirit have all full play and develop together into a natural, harmonious whole.
('71', 123, 1, 4, 249010) Man is neither mere intellect nor the gross animal body, nor the heart or soul alone.
('71', 123, 1, 5, 249096) A proper and harmonious combination of all the three is required for the making of the whole man and constitutes the true economics of education.
('71', 123, 1, 6, 249242) To say that this kind of education can only be given after we have attained our independence would, I am afraid, be like putting the cart before the horse.
('71', 123, 1, 7, 249398) The advent of independence would be incredibly hastened if we could educate millions of our people through an intelligent exercise of their respective vocations like this and teach them that they live for the common good of all.

('71', 123, 4, 10, 249689) WARDHA, April 12, 1937
('71', 123, 5, 11, 249712) You ask me to give you a special message for the readers of your 1,300 American newspapers, whom you serve.
('71', 123, 5, 12, 249820) I would like Americans first of all to know my limitations and our internal politics.
('71', 123, 5, 13, 249906) They should know that I am not even a primary member of the Congress.
('71', 123, 5, 14, 249976) Whatever influence I possess is purely moral.
('71', 123, 5, 15, 250022) Congressmen recognize in me the author of purely non violent action and its technique and, therefore, so long as the Congress retains its creed of truth and non violence, Congressmen are likely to be guided by my advice whenever it has anything to do, directly or indirectly, with non violent action, but those who can speak with authority are the President of the Congress i.e., Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, and the Working Committee, i.e., the Congress Cabinet.
('71', 123, 5, 16, 250482) I function purely as a humble adviser.
('71', 123, 6, 17, 250521) For me the present issue is not political, but moral, It is a fight between truth and untruth; non violence and violence and right and

('71', 124, 1, 2, 250699) might; for I hold that Lord Zetland could not have uttered the speech 1
('71', 124, 2, 3, 250771) he did, unless he was conscious of the might of the sword behind him.
('71', 124, 2, 4, 250841) It seems as if British statesmen are repenting of even the limited electorate they have created in India.
('71', 124, 2, 5, 250947) If they were not, they ought to have bowed to the will of the majority as represented by their elected leaders.
('71', 124, 2, 6, 251059) Surely, it is violence to impose nominated Ministries on the electorate of their creation.
('71', 124, 2, 7, 251150) The crisis is of their own making.
('71', 124, 2, 8, 251185) It is presumption on their part to interpret Acts of their Parliament.
('71', 124, 2, 9, 251256) Their jurisprudence has taught us that no man can take the law into his own hands, not even the king.
('71', 124, 2, 10, 251358) Evidently, the maxim does not apply to the British Ministers.
('71', 124, 2, 11, 251420) Proof of the pudding is in the eating.
('71', 124, 2, 12, 251459) I have offered 2 an honourable way out.
('71', 124, 2, 13, 251499) Let a judicial tribunal of joint creation give the interpretation.
('71', 124, 2, 14, 251566) It will be time for them to plead incompetence when the tribunal finds in favour of their interpretation.
('71', 124, 2, 15, 251672) Till then Congress demand for assurances must be held valid.
('71', 124, 2, 16, 251733) I must repeat that the latest gesture is one of the sword not of goodwill; certainly not of democratic obedience to the will of a democratic majority.

('71', 127, 7, 26, 255832) April 13, 1937
('71', 127, 8, 27, 255847) HARIBHAU, I have your letter.
('71', 127, 8, 28, 255877) You have made a big change as regards hip bath.
('71', 127, 8, 29, 255925) Really useful changes can be made by the patient himself, with the help of Kuhnes and Justs books.
('71', 127, 8, 30, 256024) Nature cure remedies are not like ordinary drugs.
('71', 127, 8, 31, 256074) A patient can say that a particular drug does not suit him, but only the vaidya who is treating him can say which one is likely to suit.
('71', 127, 8, 32, 256211) In nature cure, on the other hand, the patient himself knows which remedies benefit him and, after he has submitted himself to several restrictions, can himself decide as to what kind of remedies to employ and in what measures.
('71', 127, 8, 33, 256439) The reason is that the guide can never know as well as the patient can, the changes that take place in the latters body.
('71', 127, 8, 34, 256560) Do make whatever changes seem necessary.
('71', 127, 8, 35, 256601) But keep me informed, as you did this time.
('71', 127, 8, 36, 256645) I certainly wish that if no definite change is clearly visible this month, then you may spend a day in Delhi.
('71', 127, 8, 37, 256755) Saraswati Gadodia owes her job to this remedy.
('71', 127, 8, 38, 256802) Her guru is a kind maulvi.
('71', 127, 8, 39, 256829) The only attraction for going to Delhi is that you can have the benefit of the advice of both.
('71', 127, 8, 40, 256924) I carefully went

('71', 128, 1, 2, 256984) through Bhandaris book for five minutes.
('71', 128, 1, 3, 257025) I was not attracted by it.
('71', 128, 1, 4, 257052) What I want is Indian equivalents for technical terms, not definitions.
('71', 128, 1, 5, 257124) A definition of a motor car can be given, but I heard it described as air car only in Champaran.
('71', 128, 1, 6, 257221) I cannot, therefore, give my opinion all at once.
('71', 128, 1, 7, 257271) If you or somebody else tells me its special merits, then only can I express an opinion.
('71', 128, 1, 8, 257360) There was a telegram from Bhandari to which I have not been able to reply, since I did not have a dictionary.
('71', 128, 1, 9, 257470) Please convey this to him so that I need not write to him.
('71', 128, 1, 10, 257529) What you have written about surgery is quite correct.

('71', 128, 5, 14, 257692) [Before April 14, 1937] 2
('71', 128, 6, 15, 257718) MISSIONARY: I have been following your comments on the statement regarding mass movement made by the Indian Christians.
('71', 128, 6, 16, 257838) I wonder if those who made the statement were thinking of anything in the nature of a legal right.
('71', 128, 6, 17, 257937) It is, I think, a moral right they claim here rather than a legal one.
('71', 128, 6, 18, 258008) GANDHIJI: My criticism would apply even if they had used the word moral right.
('71', 128, 6, 19, 258087) But it is clear that they mean a legal right, because for one thing there is no such thing as a moral right, and secondly because in the very next para of the manifesto, in which they have referred to the Karachi Resolution 3 on Fundamental Rights, they make it clear that they mean by right legal right.
('71', 128, 6, 20, 258392) A moral right, if there is any such thing, does not need any asserting and defending.
('71', 128, 7, 21, 258478) The main purpose of the manifesto was to check the agitation that is going on in certain quarters.
('71', 128, 7, 22, 258577) I admit that if it was meant to be a protest, it was not properly drafted.
('71', 128, 7, 23, 258652) That is why I have called it an unfortunate document And is there anything like a moral right?
('71', 128, 7, 24, 258747) Give me an illustration.
('71', 128, 8, 25, 258772) Have I not a moral right to speak?
('71', 128, 9, 26, 258807) 1 This is extracted from Weekly Letter by Mahadev Desai, who had reported: An Indian Christian missionary had a long talk with Gandhiji the other day during which he put to Gandhiji questions arising from Gandhijis recent criticism of a joint manifesto issued by several influential Indian Christians.

('71', 129, 0, 1, 259271) 130 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 129, 1, 2, 259313) It is not a moral right, but a legal right.
('71', 129, 1, 3, 259357) There is no right but is legal.
('71', 129, 1, 4, 259389) Divorced from legality moral right is a misnomer.
('71', 129, 1, 5, 259439) And therefore you either enforce a right or fight for it.
('71', 129, 1, 6, 259497) Whereas nobody asserts ones duty.
('71', 129, 1, 7, 259531) He humbly performs it.
('71', 129, 1, 8, 259554) I shall take an illustration.
('71', 129, 1, 9, 259584) You are here.
('71', 129, 1, 10, 259598) You feel like preaching to me the Gospel.
('71', 129, 1, 11, 259640) I deny the right and ask you to go away.
('71', 129, 1, 12, 259681) If you regard praying for me a duty,you will quietly go away and pray for me.
('71', 129, 1, 13, 259759) But if you claim the right to preach to me, you will call the police and appeal to them for preventing my obstructing you.
('71', 129, 1, 14, 259882) That leads to a clash.
('71', 129, 1, 15, 259905) But your duty no one dare question.
('71', 129, 1, 16, 259941) You perform it here or elsewhere, and if your prayers to God to change my heart are genuine, God will change my heart.
('71', 129, 1, 17, 260060) What Christianity, according to my interpretation of it, expects you to do is to pray to God to change my heart.
('71', 129, 1, 18, 260173) Duty is a debt.
('71', 129, 1, 19, 260189) Right belongs to a creditor, and it would be a funny thing indeed if a devout Christian claimed to be a creditor!
('71', 129, 2, 20, 260303) You have objected to Christian propaganda on the ground that Harijans are illiterate and ignorant.
('71', 129, 2, 21, 260402) What would you say of propaganda amongst non Harijans?
('71', 129, 2, 22, 260457) I have the same objection, because the vast mass of people of India would not understand the pros and cons of Christianity better than a cow.
('71', 129, 2, 23, 260599) I repeat this simile in spite of the fact that it has been objected to.
('71', 129, 2, 24, 260671) When I say I do not understand logarithms any better than my cow, I do not mean any insult to my intelligence.
('71', 129, 2, 25, 260782) In matters of theology the non Harijan masses can understand no better than Harijans.
('71', 129, 2, 26, 260868) I would take you to Segaon and show you that there is no distinction, so far as capacity to understand such things is concerned, between Harijans and non harijans.
('71', 129, 2, 27, 261032) Try to preach the principles of Christianity to my wife.
('71', 129, 2, 28, 261089) She can understand them no better than my cow.
('71', 129, 2, 29, 261136) I can, because of the training that I have had.
('71', 129, 3, 30, 261184) But we do not preach any theology.
('71', 129, 3, 31, 261219) We simply talk of the life of Christ and tell them what a comfort His life and teaching have been to us.
('71', 129, 3, 32, 261324) He has been our guide, we say, and ask others also to accept Him as their guide.
('71', 129, 3, 33, 261405) Oh yes, you do say that.
('71', 129, 3, 34, 261430) But when you say I must accept Jesus in preference to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, you will have to go into deep waters.
('71', 129, 3, 35, 261547) That is why I say, let your life speak to us, even as the rose needs no speech but simply spreads its perfume.
('71', 129, 3, 36, 261658) Even the blind who do not see the rose perceive its fragrance.
('71', 129, 3, 37, 261721) That is the secret of the Gospel of the rose.
('71', 129, 3, 38, 261767) But the Gospel that Jesus preached is more subtle and fragrant than the Gospel of the rose.
('71', 129, 3, 39, 261859) If the rose needs no agent, much less does the Gospel of Christ need any agent.
('71', 129, 4, 40, 261939) But then your objection is to the commercial aspect of the Christian propaganda.
('71', 129, 4, 41, 262020) Every true Christian will agree that no baits should be offered.
('71', 130, 0, 1, 262085) VOL.71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 131
('71', 130, 1, 2, 262128) But what else is Christianity as it is preached nowadays?
('71', 130, 1, 3, 262186) Not unless you isolate the proselytizing aspect from your educational andmedical institutions are they any worth.
('71', 130, 1, 4, 262300) Why should students attending Mission schools and colleges be compelled or even expected to attend Bible classes?
('71', 130, 1, 5, 262414) If they must understand the message of Jesus, why not also of Buddha, Zoroaster and Mahomed?
('71', 130, 1, 6, 262507) Why should the bait of education be offered for giving education [sic]?
('71', 130, 2, 7, 262579) That was the old way, not the modern way.
('71', 130, 2, 8, 262621) I can cite to you any number of modern examples.
('71', 130, 2, 9, 262670) Is not the Bishop of Dornakal a modern?
('71', 130, 2, 10, 262710) And what else is his open letter to the Depressed Classes of India?
('71', 130, 2, 11, 262778) It is full of baits.
('71', 130, 3, 12, 262799) He represents a type of Christianity which I do not approve.
('71', 130, 3, 13, 262860) But where there is no compulsion to attend the Bible classes, and only education is given, what objection is there to educational institutions run by Missions?
('71', 130, 3, 14, 263020) There is a subtle kind of propaganda when you expect students to attend Bible classes.
('71', 130, 4, 15, 263107) As regards hospitals, I think philanthrophy without the dynamic[s] of some religious teaching will not tell.
('71', 130, 4, 16, 263216) Then you commercialize your gift, for at the back of your mind is the feeling that because of your service some day the recipient of the gift will accept Christ.
('71', 130, 4, 17, 263378) Why should not your service be its own reward?
('71', 130, 5, 18, 263425) But leave alone these.
('71', 130, 5, 19, 263448) I think I can cite instances of exceptionally fine people who attract people to them by the example of their lives.
('71', 130, 5, 20, 263564) I too can cite such instances.
('71', 130, 5, 21, 263595) Andrews is one such.
('71', 130, 5, 22, 263616) But they are exceptions.
('71', 130, 6, 23, 263641) But then you must judge Christianity by its best representatives, and not the worst.
('71', 130, 6, 24, 263726) I am not judging Christianity as a religion.
('71', 130, 6, 25, 263771) I am talking of the way Christianity is being propagated, and you cannot judge it by exceptions, even as you may not judge the British system of Government by some fine specimens of Englishmen.
('71', 130, 6, 26, 263965) No, let us think of the bulk of your people who preach the Gospel.
('71', 130, 6, 27, 264032) Do they spread the perfume of their lives?
('71', 130, 6, 28, 264075) That is to me the sole criterion.
('71', 130, 6, 29, 264109) All I want them to do is to live Christian lives, not to annotate them.
('71', 130, 6, 30, 264181) I have come to this view after laborious and prayerful search, and I am glad to say that there is a growing body of Christians who accept my view.
('71', 130, 7, 31, 264328) Then, I should be obliged to hear from you your attitude to the personality of Jesus.
('71', 131, 0, 1, 264414) 132 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 131, 1, 2, 264456) I have often made it clear.
('71', 131, 1, 3, 264484) I regard Jesus as a great teacher of humanity, but I do not regard him as the only begotten son of God.
('71', 131, 1, 4, 264588) That epithet in its material interpretation is quite unacceptable.
('71', 131, 1, 5, 264655) Metaphorically we are all begotten sons of God, but for each of us there may be different begotten son of God in a special sense.
('71', 131, 1, 6, 264785) Thus for me Chaitanya may be the only begotten son of God.
('71', 131, 2, 7, 264844) But dont you believe in the perfection of human nature, and dont you believe that Jesus had attained perfection?
('71', 131, 2, 8, 264957) I believe in the perfectability of human nature.
('71', 131, 2, 9, 265006) Jesus came as near to perfection as possible.
('71', 131, 2, 10, 265052) To say that he was perfect is to deny Gods superiority to man.
('71', 131, 2, 11, 265115) And then in this mater I have a theory of my own.
('71', 131, 2, 12, 265165) Being necessarily limited by the bonds of flesh, we can attain perfection only after dissolution of the body.
('71', 131, 2, 13, 265275) Therefore God alone is absolutely perfect.
('71', 131, 2, 14, 265318) When he descends to earth, He of His own accord limits Himself.
('71', 131, 2, 15, 265382) Jesus died on the Cross because he was limited by the flesh.
('71', 131, 2, 16, 265443) I do not need either the prophecies or the miracles to establish Jesuss greatness as a teacher.
('71', 131, 2, 17, 265539) Nothing can be more miraculous than the three years of his ministry.
('71', 131, 2, 18, 265608) There is no miracle in the story of the multitude being fed on a handful of loaves.
('71', 131, 2, 19, 265692) A magician can create that illusion.
('71', 131, 2, 20, 265729) But woe worth the day on which a magician would be hailed as the Saviour of humanity.
('71', 131, 2, 21, 265815) As for Jesus raising the dead to life, well, I doubt if the men he raised were really dead.
('71', 131, 2, 22, 265907) I raised a relatives child from supposed death to life, but that was because the child was not dead, and but for my presence there she might have been cremated.
('71', 131, 2, 23, 266068) But I saw that life was not extinct.
('71', 131, 2, 24, 266105) I gave her an enema and she was restored to life.
('71', 131, 2, 25, 266155) There was no miracle about it.
('71', 131, 2, 26, 266186) I do not deny that Jesus had certain psychic powers and he was undoubtedly filled with the love of humanity.
('71', 131, 2, 27, 266295) But he brought to life not people who were dead but who were believed to be dead.
('71', 131, 2, 28, 266377) The laws of Nature are changeless, unchangeable, and there are no miracles in the sense of infringement or interruption of Natures laws.
('71', 131, 2, 29, 266514) But we limited beings fancy all kind of things and impute our limitations to God.
('71', 131, 2, 30, 266596) We may copy God, but not He us.
('71', 131, 2, 31, 266628) We may not divide Time for Him, Time for Him is eternity.
('71', 131, 2, 32, 266686) For us there is past, present and future.
('71', 131, 2, 33, 266728) And what is human life of a hundred years but less than a mere speck in the eternity of Time?

('71', 132, 6, 8, 267103) MY ADVICE TO THE CONGRESS HAS ALWAYS
('71', 132, 7, 9, 267140) BEEN THAT OFFICE ACCEPTANCE WOULD BE A FATAL BLUNDER
('71', 132, 8, 10, 267193) WITHOUT A PREVIOUS UNDERSTANDING REGARDING SAFEGUARDS

('71', 132, 16, 18, 267611) THEY DISLIKE.

('71', 132, 21, 26, 267844) THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT TO SHOW THE CONGRESS
('71', 132, 22, 27, 267888) BY EVERY MEANS OPEN WITHIN THEIR CONSTITUTION
('71', 132, 23, 28, 267934) THAT THE CONGRESS CAN ADVANCE TOWARDS ITS

('71', 133, 18, 23, 269398) 1 In this, Lord Lothian had said: .
('71', 133, 18, 24, 269434) the Governors could constitutionally give the assurance which the Congress Committee asks for, would not the minority in each Province protest vehemently against their giving this promise and would not such an undertaking conflict with the basic principle of constitutional democracy, namely, that neither the party in a majority nor the Governor should be able to exercise arbitrary power without appeal to anybody?
('71', 133, 18, 25, 269851) The discretion which a Governor has to exercise is whether his special responsibility will better be discharged by accepting or rejecting the advice of his Ministry when attempts at agreement have failed.
('71', 133, 18, 26, 270056) His decision, as all past history shows, largely depends on whether the majority in the Legislature is united and resolute and whether it can count on the support of the electorate in the event of a dissolution.

('71', 133, 18, 29, 270368) 3 In its issue dated April 10,which read: The Congress put before the electors the definite statement that the safeguards and special powers in the present Act make it absolutely impossible for a Congress majority to put through its social programme for dealing with poverty and unemployment.
('71', 133, 18, 30, 270661) If the Act is really such that there is the slightest difficulty in the Governors telling Congress leaders that there is nothing to prevent them going ahead with the programme outlined in the election manifesto, then we have to admit that we too have been mistaken about the Act.

('71', 134, 9, 16, 271854) Interviewed by the Associated Press as regards Lord Lothians letter 3 to the London Times, Mahatma Gandhi said that he had nothing to add to what he already stated in his cable 4 to the London Times (which Reuter had cabled to India).
('71', 134, 9, 17, 272089) He added, however, that if he had anything to say further he would do so at Poona.

('71', 135, 2, 3, 272934) The interviewer referred to Mr. Rajagopalacharis statement, in which he said that Mahatma Gandhi was in the thick of it and, before Mahatma Gandhi could be asked whether this meant his coming back to the Congress, Gandhiji forestalled the interviewer and said: It means nothing more nothing less than what it says.
('71', 135, 2, 4, 273249) I am in the thick of it.
('71', 135, 2, 5, 273274) I am not rejoining the Congress at present if that is what you mean.

('71', 135, 5, 10, 273500) I am glad you were able to go to the villages.
('71', 135, 5, 11, 273547) It is certainly good news that the surrounding villages are voluntarily taking village reform.
('71', 135, 5, 12, 273642) No good work but spreads like the perfume of a rose.
('71', 135, 5, 13, 273695) You will take the additional man carefully.

('71', 135, 8, 20, 274006) I respond to the situation as it arises.
('71', 135, 9, 21, 274047) Regarding the future course of action Gandhiji said there was nothing to add to the former statements as nothing fresh had occured.
('71', 135, 10, 22, 274179) Later when he was shown the statement of the Madras leader, Mahatma Gandhi after a cursory persual opined that it needed careful study before he could give his opinion on it.
('71', 135, 10, 23, 274354) He added that he would do so as early as possible tomorrow after

('71', 136, 1, 2, 274462) carefully going through it.
('71', 136, 1, 3, 274490) All he would say was that the suggestion contained in the statement, which had the backing of all communities, needed great consideration.
('71', 136, 2, 4, 274629) A large crowd turned out at the station for darshan and Mahatma Gandhi taking the opportunity started collecting funds for Harijans.

('71', 136, 4, 7, 274843) April 16, 1937
('71', 136, 5, 8, 274858) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, Please speak up if my voice does not reach you.
('71', 136, 5, 9, 274928) I shall speak a little louder.
('71', 136, 5, 10, 274959) I have agreed to say a few words before the President starts the discussion.
('71', 136, 5, 11, 275036) During the next six days I shall try to participate in the meetings as much as I can.
('71', 136, 5, 12, 275122) One thing I wish to mention right at the outset.
('71', 136, 5, 13, 275171) When I arrived in the morning, someone remarked that if the Faizpur Congress was Jawaharlals, the Hudli Congress was going to be Gandhis.
('71', 136, 5, 14, 275309) It was conveyed to me by the President or someone else.
('71', 136, 5, 15, 275365) I know it was said in jest.
('71', 136, 5, 16, 275393) But it pained me that such a thing should be said even in jest.
('71', 136, 5, 17, 275457) It is a sin to imagine even in jest that there can be any rivalry between Jawaharlal and me, or the Congress and the Gandhi Seva Sangh.
('71', 136, 5, 18, 275593) The Gandhi Seva Sangh is not opposed to the Congress.
('71', 136, 5, 19, 275647) It is meant to serve the Congress.
('71', 136, 5, 20, 275682) How could the Sangh be opposed to the Congress when it was conceived in order to carry out the constructive programme of the Congress?
('71', 136, 5, 21, 275817) But I would go even further.
('71', 136, 5, 22, 275846) The Congress represents the millions.
('71', 136, 5, 23, 275884) The Sangh represents us.
('71', 136, 5, 24, 275909) The members of the Sangh are either their own representatives or the representatives of truth and non violence.
('71', 136, 5, 25, 276021) You can say that the whole world should be the representative of truth and non violence.
('71', 136, 5, 26, 276110) But that is a different matter.
('71', 136, 5, 27, 276142) The members of the Sangh would, under the present situation, represent only themselves.
('71', 136, 5, 28, 276230) But do we not want to be the representatives of the millions as well?
('71', 136, 5, 29, 276300) And it is the Congress which is pledged to be the voice of the suffering millions.
('71', 136, 5, 30, 276383) How, then, can there be any opposition between us and the Congress?
('71', 136, 5, 31, 276451) I would go to the extent of saying that the Sangh can have rivalry with none at all.
('71', 136, 5, 32, 276536) Let no one suggest even in jest that there can possibly be any rivalry between the Sangh and the Congress.
('71', 136, 5, 33, 276643) For, it would be an untruth.
('71', 136, 5, 34, 276672) And it is forbidden to speak an untruth even in jest.
('71', 136, 5, 35, 276726) Anyone who hears it must promptly stop it.
('71', 136, 5, 36, 276769) I wish to give you a warning.
('71', 136, 5, 37, 276799) Surely, we do not

('71', 137, 0, 1, 276880) 138 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 137, 1, 2, 276922) intend to indulge in a fight with anyone.
('71', 137, 1, 3, 276964) We cannot even talk in such terms.
('71', 137, 1, 4, 276999) Another thing which I wish to suggest is whether it would not be better to change the name of the Gandhi Seva Sangh.
('71', 137, 1, 5, 277116) You have asso ciated my name with the Sangh.
('71', 137, 1, 6, 277161) This does not mean that my field of operation is limited only to this.
('71', 137, 1, 7, 277232) I wish to make the whole of India my field of activity.
('71', 137, 1, 8, 277288) I have suggested a way and you have accepted it.
('71', 137, 1, 9, 277337) But it is not good for us to worship an individual.
('71', 137, 1, 10, 277389) Only an ideal or a prin ciple can be worshipped.
('71', 137, 1, 11, 277438) You have agreed to carry out the progra mme I placed before the country in 1920. Only that part of it which you have assimilated and digested belongs to you.
('71', 137, 1, 12, 277596) My faith in that programme is brighter than ever.
('71', 137, 1, 13, 277646) But will you abandon the pro gramme if I say that my faith in it has dwindled?
('71', 137, 1, 14, 277725) You cannot give it up even if I do so.
('71', 137, 1, 15, 277764) You should not become my worshippers.
('71', 137, 1, 16, 277802) You can worship truth and non violence.
('71', 137, 1, 17, 277842) When you have accepted a thing, it belongs to you independently.
('71', 137, 1, 18, 277907) And only what independently belongs to you can be really yours.
('71', 137, 1, 19, 277971) Like food, only what you have assimlated would serve you any purpose.
('71', 137, 1, 20, 278041) When we accept someones ideas but do not digest them, absorb them intellectually but not emotionally anddo not translate them into practice, it is a kind of indigestion.
('71', 137, 1, 21, 278211) It is an intellectual luxury.
('71', 137, 1, 22, 278241) Ill digested ideas are much worse than ill digested food.
('71', 137, 1, 23, 278299) There is a cure for ill digested food; but ill digested ideas harm the spirit and there is no cure for it.
('71', 137, 1, 24, 278406) It is right that I should help you.
('71', 137, 1, 25, 278442) You have right to pick up a quarrel with me if I say anything which is contrary to what I said in 1920. You must consider independently whether I have improved upon those ideas or allowed them to degenerate.
('71', 137, 1, 26, 278650) Let me tell you that day by day I am marching ahead in the direction of progress and the application of my principles covers a wider field.
('71', 137, 1, 27, 278790) You will have to judge if I am progressing in the right direction.
('71', 137, 1, 28, 278857) You cannot do so if you do not exercise your power of independent judgment.
('71', 137, 1, 29, 278933) The world will ridicule you if you keep on sticking to my name.
('71', 137, 1, 30, 278997) But there is another and graver danger.
('71', 137, 1, 31, 279037) I have a fear that the Sangh may degenerate into a sect.
('71', 137, 1, 32, 279094) If such a thing is possible while I am still alive, what may not happen when I am gone?
('71', 137, 1, 33, 279182) Whenever a difficult situation arises, you would refer to my writings in Young India and Harijan and swear by them to support your own argument.
('71', 137, 1, 34, 279327) It would be proper to cremate all my writings with my body.
('71', 137, 1, 35, 279387) I am not saying this out of any sense of modesty.
('71', 137, 1, 36, 279437) Have I not already said that the world is not going to lose anything even if all our Vedas are destroyed and only the first mantra of Ishopanishad survives?
('71', 137, 1, 37, 279594) And what purpose would be served even by that mantra if we do not understand it and follow it in our actions?
('71', 138, 0, 1, 279704) VOL.71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 139
('71', 138, 1, 2, 279747) Whatever I have said or written is useful only to the extent that it can help you in understanding and digesting the principles of truth and non violence.
('71', 138, 1, 3, 279902) Hence you must give a serious thought to what I am saying today.
('71', 138, 1, 4, 279967) My faith in truth and non violence becomes stronger every day.
('71', 138, 1, 5, 280030) And as I go on applying these principles to my life, I go on making progress, and with that my ideas acquire a fresh quality.
('71', 138, 1, 6, 280156) This does not mean that I am disorganized and my mind is not steady, or that my intellect is becoming shaky.
('71', 138, 1, 7, 280265) I claim that my intellect has not lost its sharpness even though I have aged.
('71', 138, 1, 8, 280343) It is not as if I was making thoughtless statements.
('71', 138, 1, 9, 280396) My intellect continues to grow and in the matter of truth and non violence it comes face to face with new things every day.
('71', 138, 1, 10, 280520) And I find new light in them.
('71', 138, 1, 11, 280550) I find new meanings in them every day.
('71', 138, 1, 12, 280589) Hence, I continue to give new suggestions to the organizations like the Spinners Association, Harijan Sevak Sangh, Village Industries Association etc.
('71', 138, 1, 13, 280740) This means that these organizationsand their organizers are very much alive.
('71', 138, 1, 14, 280817) And like a tree they will go on acquiring a changing quality assuming ever new forms.
('71', 138, 1, 15, 280903) Their merit is that they should grow and progress.
('71', 138, 1, 16, 280954) They would meet their downfall if they do not do so.
('71', 138, 1, 17, 281007) I for one do not feel at all that I am going down.
('71', 138, 1, 18, 281058) I want you to march with me in the direction of progress.
('71', 138, 1, 19, 281116) I am not keen to know what would happen when I am dead.
('71', 138, 1, 20, 281172) My only desire is that the Sangh should always grow like a tree.
('71', 138, 1, 21, 281237) If you worship the idealsnot meyou should remove my name from the name of the Sangh.
('71', 138, 1, 22, 281322) You should not be so much attached to my name.
('71', 138, 1, 23, 281369) You must measure each action of yours with the yardstick of truth and non violence.
('71', 138, 1, 24, 281453) If you make this your yardstick, you will be able to deliberate on all problems without any fear even after I am gone.
('71', 138, 1, 25, 281572) All of you who have come here should always be fully awake.
('71', 138, 1, 26, 281632) You are going to face problems which will demand from you a fresh outlook.
('71', 138, 1, 27, 281707) I hope that with the light of truth you will be able to do so.

('71', 138, 4, 31, 282014) 1 The resolutions are not reproduced here.
('71', 139, 0, 1, 282057) 140 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 139, 1, 2, 282099) When the scheme was inaugurated many workers had grave doubts about its success.
('71', 139, 1, 3, 282180) They had thought that the consequent rise in the price of khadi will adversely affect the sales.
('71', 139, 1, 4, 282277) Experience has dispelled the fears and the Council is anxious to take a further step forward, if it can at all be taken, at an early date.
('71', 139, 1, 5, 282416) Whilst, therefore, there need be no haste about taking the further step, workers may not be lazy about it either.
('71', 139, 1, 6, 282530) They should know that the goal is eight annas per day of eight hours.
('71', 139, 1, 7, 282600) We have only nominally reached three annas which are evenly distributed between increase and efficiency.
('71', 139, 1, 8, 282705) The efficiency earnings do not directly affect the sale price.
('71', 139, 1, 9, 282768) If anything, the efficiency of spinners improves the quality of khadi.
('71', 139, 1, 10, 282839) The direct increase in the wages undoubtedly raises the prices, but its burden is broken by the improvement in quality.
('71', 139, 1, 11, 282959) Then the increase is sojudiciously regulated as to affect the poorest buyer not at all or very slightly.
('71', 139, 1, 12, 283064) I have no manner of doubt that if only the workers will themselves be more efficient, more vigilant and more faithful, they will hasten the day when spinners can easily earn eight annas per day of eight hours work without involving a phenomenal rise in the sale price.
('71', 139, 1, 13, 283333) More scientific knowledge must improve the capacity of hand gins, carding bows and spinning wheels.
('71', 139, 1, 14, 283433) Greater observation of spinners work must result in their being more skilled and more efficient.
('71', 139, 1, 15, 283530) Greater grasp of administrative detail and greater faithfulness must mean a substantial decrease in overhead charges.
('71', 139, 1, 16, 283648) In other words, our ignorance of the science of khadi is at the bottom of our present inability to reach the goal of eight annas per day.
('71', 139, 1, 17, 283786) The resolution is intended as a spur to effort.
('71', 139, 1, 18, 283834) God helps only the ever watchful.

('71', 139, 2, 20, 283887) 158. BAD IF TRUE
('71', 139, 3, 21, 283904) Shri P. O. Philip of the National Christian Council has received the following complaint from Travancore:
('71', 139, 4, 22, 284010) Many thanks for your letter.
('71', 139, 4, 23, 284039) I am consoled by the fact that the Mahatma will use his influence in removing the ill feeling of the caste Hindus in Travancore towards Christians and the Depressed Class converts.
('71', 139, 4, 24, 284220) Last week, while my evangelist Jacob was returning from a Church in North Travancore after the baptism of eight Pariahs, he was stopped by a Hindu Excise (Government) peon and was seriously assulted.
('71', 139, 4, 25, 284420) One of his eyes is injured by the blows.
('71', 139, 4, 26, 284461) The peon said the evangelist had no business to teach and prepare people for baptism after the Temple entry Proclamation.
('71', 139, 4, 27, 284583) I have written about this to the The Madras Mail and the Manorama, but my note has not appeared
('71', 140, 0, 1, 284679) VOL.71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 141
('71', 140, 1, 2, 284722) in the papers.
('71', 140, 1, 3, 284737) Will you please give publicity to the hideous act?
('71', 140, 1, 4, 284788) Such acts are not isolated ones, but are perpetrated with the knowledge of influential caste Hindus who want to suppress if possible the progress of Christianity.
('71', 140, 1, 5, 284951) You may forward a copy of this note to Mr. Gandhi.
('71', 140, 1, 6, 285002) Communal hatred is on the increase after the Temple entry Proclamation!
('71', 140, 1, 7, 285074) A similar complaint was received by me a few weeks ago through the same source.
('71', 140, 1, 8, 285154) I have forwarded the papers to the Travancore Harijan Sevak Sangh for investigation.
('71', 140, 1, 9, 285239) Meantime I have the foregoing.
('71', 140, 1, 10, 285270) The brief postcard contains most serious allegations.
('71', 140, 1, 11, 285324) The writer claims that 1. the acts are not isolated; 2. they are perpetrated with the knowledge of influential caste Hindus; 3. caste Hindus want to suppress if possible the progress of Christianity; 4. communal hatred is on the increase after the Temple entry Proclamation.
('71', 140, 1, 12, 285599) Now these statements ought not to be lightly made.
('71', 140, 1, 13, 285650) I advise the writer to furnish proofs to the Harijan Sevak Sangh who, I promise, will thoroughly investigate the whole complaint.
('71', 140, 1, 14, 285780) The Sangh has a retired High Court judge as its President and a most conscientious and cultured man as its Secretary.
('71', 140, 1, 15, 285898) I myself will have no hesitation in denouncing the slightest departure by caste Hindus from the strictest non violence.
('71', 140, 1, 16, 286018) It is difficult for me to see why communal hatred should be on the increase because of the Temple entry Proclamation.
('71', 140, 1, 17, 286136) Certainly I observed none during my recent tour in Travancore.
('71', 140, 1, 18, 286199) And in so far as specific charges of molestation are concerned I would advise Shri Philips correspondent to file complaints in the local courts.
('71', 140, 1, 19, 286344) I may mention that I received complaints of a contrary nature from caste Hindus alleging that Harijans living in or near Christian cheris were molested by Christians.
('71', 140, 1, 20, 286511) I refused to publish the statements and referred the writers to the local courts.
('71', 140, 1, 21, 286593) I would have likewise treated the foregoing postcard but for the very serious allegations contained in it.
('71', 140, 1, 22, 286700) They could only be dealt with publicly and by a public investigation.

('71', 140, 3, 25, 286825) This school has gone through several vicissitudes because of the inexperience of the management.
('71', 140, 3, 26, 286922) The A. I. V. I. A. has to cut its way as it proceeds through an unbeaten track.
('71', 140, 3, 27, 287002) A years experience and
('71', 141, 0, 1, 287025) 142 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 141, 1, 2, 287067) experimenting have made the management less ambitious.
('71', 141, 1, 3, 287122) The teachers themselves are training themselves through experimenting.
('71', 141, 1, 4, 287193) And when the next terms commences, there will be greater preparedness than hitherto.
('71', 141, 1, 5, 287278) Here is the unambitious but more realistic prospectus of the school: 1
('71', 141, 2, 6, 287349) The academic year of the All India Village Industries Association Training School for Village Workers will begin from Ist July 1937. .
('71', 141, 3, 7, 287484) 1. Hindi will be the medium of instruction.
('71', 141, 4, 8, 287528) 2. The course will be as far as may be for a period of 12 months, of which two months will have to be spent in village uplift centres for practical study.
('71', 141, 4, 9, 287683) In the first 10 months training in the following industries, together with some theoretical knowledge for village work, will be given:
('71', 141, 5, 10, 287818) 1. Paddy husking and grinding
('71', 141, 6, 11, 287848) 2. Paper making
('71', 141, 7, 12, 287864) 3. Oil pressing by ghani
('71', 141, 8, 13, 287889) 4. Date palm gur making
('71', 141, 9, 14, 287913) 5. Bee keeping
('71', 141, 10, 15, 287928) Students will have to select one of the above industries and devote six hours every day to it.
('71', 141, 11, 16, 288023) 3. Students will be examined at the end of the year and, if found necessary, the course may be prolonged.
('71', 141, 12, 17, 288129) 4. Applicants for admission should not be less than 18 years of age and should possess a healthy body.
('71', 141, 12, 18, 288232) On arrival, such of those as the School Committee requires will undergo preliminary examination and will be expected to pass a test equal to what is known as the Vernacular Middle Course, and may be rejected if they do not possess adequate knowledge.
('71', 141, 12, 19, 288483) They should have a working knowledge of Hindi, should be habitual wearers of khadi and should be prepared to do manual work such as sanitary service, kitchen work and spinning, and such other work as may be required under the discipline of the School.
('71', 141, 12, 20, 288735) Let the applicants study the prospectus carefully.
('71', 141, 12, 21, 288786) Those who are disinclined to do manual labour and apply themselves to the practical learning of the industry of their choice will be disappointed.
('71', 141, 12, 22, 288933) Those who appreciated the necessity of mastering the industries mentioned will find ample scope for their talents.

('71', 142, 1, 2, 289147) 160. FOR STUDENTS
('71', 142, 2, 3, 289165) Though this letter 1 was received about the end of February last, I am able to deal with it only now.
('71', 142, 2, 4, 289267) It raises issues of great importance, each demanding large enough space for two columns of Harijan.
('71', 142, 2, 5, 289367) But I must be brief.
('71', 142, 2, 6, 289388) The very difficulties the student raises, though serious in their setting, are of his own making.
('71', 142, 2, 7, 289486) The very mention of them must show the falsity of his position and of the educational system in our country.
('71', 142, 2, 8, 289595) It turns education into a purely commercial product to be converted into money.
('71', 142, 2, 9, 289675) For me education has a much nobler purpose.
('71', 142, 2, 10, 289719) Let the student count himself as one among millions and he will discover that millions of young men and women of his age cannot fulfil the conditions which he will have his degree to do.
('71', 142, 2, 11, 289906) Why should he make himself responsible for the maintenance of all the relatives he mentions?
('71', 142, 2, 12, 289999) Why should the grown up ones, if of sound body, not labour for their maintenance?
('71', 142, 2, 13, 290081) It is wrong to have many drones to one busy beethough a male.
('71', 142, 2, 14, 290143) The remedy lies in his unlearning many things.
('71', 142, 2, 15, 290190) He must revise his ideas of education.
('71', 142, 2, 16, 290229) His sisters ought not to repeat the expensive education that he had.
('71', 142, 2, 17, 290298) They can develop their intelligence through learning some handicraft in a scientific manner.
('71', 142, 2, 18, 290391) The moment they do so, they have development of the mind side by side with that of the body.
('71', 142, 2, 19, 290484) And if they will learn to regard themselves as servants of humanity rather than its exploiters, they will have development of the heart, i.e., the soul as well.
('71', 142, 2, 20, 290645) And they will become equal earners of bread with their brother.
('71', 142, 2, 21, 290709) I might as well discuss here his sisters marriage to which reference has been made in the letter.
('71', 142, 2, 22, 290807) I do not know what is meant by marriage taking place sooner rather than later.
('71', 142, 2, 23, 290886) In no case need it take place before they are 20 years old.
('71', 142, 2, 24, 290946) It is no use thinking so many years in advance.
('71', 142, 2, 25, 290994) And if he will revise the whole scheme of life, he willhave the sisters to choose their partners and the ceremony need never cost more than five rupees each, if that.
('71', 142, 2, 26, 291161) I have been present at several such ceremonies.
('71', 142, 2, 27, 291209) And the husbands or their elders have been graduates in fair circumstances.
('71', 142, 3, 28, 291285) 1 The letter is not reproduced here.
('71', 142, 3, 29, 291322) The correspondent said that Gandhiji had not done justice to a student in his reply; vide Notes, sub title A Students Difficulty, 9 1 1937 He also asked for a detailed, practical and comprehensive solution to some of his personal problems.
('71', 143, 0, 1, 291562) 144 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 143, 1, 2, 291604) It is pathetic to find the student so helpless as not to know how and where to have spinning lessons.
('71', 143, 1, 3, 291706) Let him make a diligent search in Lucknow and he will find that there are young men enough to teach him.
('71', 143, 1, 4, 291811) But he need not confine himself to spinning, though it too is fast becoming a full time occupation able to give a village minded man or woman his or her livelihood.
('71', 143, 1, 5, 291976) I hope I have said here sufficient to enable him to dot the is and cross the ts.
('71', 143, 1, 6, 292057) And now for contraceptives.
('71', 143, 1, 7, 292085) Even here, the difficulty is imaginary.
('71', 143, 1, 8, 292125) He is wrong in underrating his wifes intelligence.
('71', 143, 1, 9, 292176) I have no doubt whatsoever that if she is the ordinary type of womanhood, she will readily respond to his self restraint.
('71', 143, 1, 10, 292298) Let him be true to himself and ask himself whether he has enough of it himself.
('71', 143, 1, 11, 292378) All the evidence in my possession goes to show that it is man who lacks the power of self restraint more than woman.
('71', 143, 1, 12, 292495) But there is no need for belittling his own inability to exercise restraint.
('71', 143, 1, 13, 292572) He must manfully face the prospect of a large family and discover the best means of suporting them.
('71', 143, 1, 14, 292672) He must know that against the millions who are strangers to the use of contraceptives, there are possibly a few thousand who use them.
('71', 143, 1, 15, 292807) The millions are in no dread of having to breed their children though the latter may not all be wanted.
('71', 143, 1, 16, 292911) I suggest that it is cowardly to refuse to face the consequences of ones acts.
('71', 143, 1, 17, 292990) Persons who use contraceptives will never learn the virtue of self restraint.
('71', 143, 1, 18, 293068) They will not need it.
('71', 143, 1, 19, 293091) Self indulgence with contraceptives may prevent the coming of children but will sap the vitality of both men ad womenperhaps more of men than of women.
('71', 143, 1, 20, 293243) It is unmanly to refuse battle with the devil.
('71', 143, 1, 21, 293290) Let my correspondent resolve upon self restraint as the only sure and honourable method of avoiding unwanted children.
('71', 143, 1, 22, 293409) What though he and his fail in the effort a hundred times?
('71', 143, 1, 23, 293468) Joy is in the battle.
('71', 143, 1, 24, 293490) The result comes by the grace of God.

('71', 143, 3, 27, 293570) The reader will remember Rajkumari Amrit Kaurs letter 1 to me published in these columns some weeks ago.
('71', 143, 3, 28, 293675) She received on it, some time ago, a letter from an English friend.
('71', 143, 3, 29, 293743) She sent it to me to read.
('71', 143, 3, 30, 293770) It contained so much that was good that I asked for permission to publish the relevant portion.
('71', 143, 3, 31, 293866) This she readily gave and copied it for me.
('71', 143, 3, 32, 293910) Here are the passages:
('71', 143, 4, 33, 293933) 1 Vide A Christian Letter, 30 1 1937
('71', 144, 0, 1, 293970) VOL.71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 145
('71', 144, 1, 2, 294013) I have been meaning to write to you ever since I read in Harijan your fine letter to Mr. Gandhi.
('71', 144, 1, 3, 294110) I want to tell you how very much I feel with you about what you said with regard to missionary work and to thank you for saying it in your own way to a man like Mahatmaji.
('71', 144, 1, 4, 294282) When I was in India, first as a very undeveloped girl thrust into a C. M. S. atmosphere, very many years ago, I felt that the approach of the missionaries to the people of India was all wrong and I had lonely times of being up against the whole system and yet not exactly being able to formulate my idea or talk to others with any chance of being understood.
('71', 144, 1, 5, 294641) I was also set wondering if we as British people had any right to be ruling India, and I remember expressing this in those early days and being firmly dealt with!
('71', 144, 1, 6, 294804) But ever since those days as my thought life has developed I have been getting to feel that fundamentally the whole position of the British in India was wrong and that the missionaries as a whole were sharing in the superiority complex of those who ruled.
('71', 144, 1, 7, 295060) I am regarded, I know, as a real black sheep in missionary circles.
('71', 144, 1, 8, 295128) So I can thoroughly sympathize with criticism that I am sure you have met with from those quarters!
('71', 144, 1, 9, 295228) But what you said needed saying by someone who was a Christian and who yet saw a different way of sharing her faith with others.
('71', 144, 1, 10, 295357) And it makes all the difference when someone like you who is known and has a position in the country says these things.
('71', 144, 2, 11, 295477) We sing in our Churches in England that grand hymn, whose words I expect you know, written by that inspired blind poet George Matheson:
('71', 144, 3, 12, 295613) Gather us in; we worship only thee
('71', 144, 4, 13, 295648) In varied names we stretch a common hand;
('71', 144, 5, 14, 295690) In diverse forms a common soul we see;
('71', 144, 6, 15, 295729) In many ships we seek one spirit land;
('71', 144, 7, 16, 295768) Gather us in.
('71', 144, 8, 17, 295782) Each sees one colour in Thy rainbow light,
('71', 144, 9, 18, 295825) Each looks upon one tint and calls it heaven,
('71', 144, 10, 19, 295871) Thou art the fulness of OUR partial sight;
('71', 144, 11, 20, 295914) We are not perfect till we find the seven;
('71', 144, 12, 21, 295957) Gather us in.
('71', 144, 13, 22, 295971) Anyway it is a step beyond From Green Lands lcy Mountains!
('71', 144, 13, 23, 296030) But I sometimes wonder if the people here who sing this realize its implications.

('71', 145, 3, 4, 296235) MY DEAR REBEL, Your letter.
('71', 145, 3, 5, 296263) It is now just before morning prayer time.
('71', 145, 3, 6, 296306) The night was quite cool.
('71', 145, 3, 7, 296332) I slept on the beautiful soft ground.

('71', 145, 3, 10, 296421) If we are to re introduce village articles after being used to the Western style, we shall have to be patient and inventive.
('71', 145, 3, 11, 296546) That the pen requires constant dipping is a good point.
('71', 145, 3, 12, 296602) It lessens fatigue.
('71', 145, 3, 13, 296622) That the fountain pen saves time is not an unmixed blessing.
('71', 145, 3, 14, 296683) The village pen and ink undoubtedly admit of improvement.
('71', 145, 3, 15, 296741) That can only come when you and I use these things.
('71', 145, 3, 16, 296793) The rule to which you took objection has been altered so as to answer your objection.
('71', 145, 3, 17, 296879) There was a dispute between Transvaal and British Gover nments.
('71', 145, 3, 18, 296943) The matter was referred to arbitration by the Governments.

('71', 145, 8, 26, 297229) We should investigate.

('71', 146, 2, 5, 297764) I am just telling you my impression after reading the whole biography of the Prophet.
('71', 146, 2, 6, 297850) If I start looking for imperfections and faults, I can find many but while doing so a man begins to despair and there is no reason to despair.
('71', 146, 2, 7, 297993) I left out about the hearing of the inner voice because while replying I did not have your letter before me.
('71', 146, 2, 8, 298102) One who wants to hear the inner voice should observe five yamas 2. The rules laid down for the observance of yamas should be adhered to and in order to do that one should devote as much time as possible to the repetition of His name so that it becomes as orderly as natural as breathing and the repetition should become as the beating of our heart.
('71', 146, 2, 9, 298451) We do not hear our heartbeats but the heart goes on beating.
('71', 146, 2, 10, 298512) Similarly the repetition of His name should go on.
('71', 146, 2, 11, 298563) I have written on the subject many times in my articles.

('71', 146, 5, 16, 298755) April 17, 1937
('71', 146, 6, 17, 298770) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, At the outset I wish to say a few things which are not relevant to the subject under discussion.
('71', 146, 6, 18, 298889) Dr. Batra is here.
('71', 146, 6, 19, 298908) I had requested him to give a helping hand in the sanitation arrangements.
('71', 146, 6, 20, 298983) He told me a few things which I want to tell you about.
('71', 146, 6, 21, 299039) First, the soil here is sandy.
('71', 146, 6, 22, 299070) For washing we need alkali in more or less degree.
('71', 146, 6, 23, 299121) Sand contains no alkali.
('71', 146, 6, 24, 299146) It is to be found only in earth.
('71', 146, 6, 25, 299179) Therefore earth is our soap.
('71', 146, 6, 26, 299208) We cannot wash our hands as effectively with sand as with earth.
('71', 146, 6, 27, 299273) We should remember that there should either be earth placed in heaps outside latrins or members should use soap to wash their hands.
('71', 146, 7, 28, 299406) 1 The addressee had been repeatedly writing to Gandhiji about the short comings of Islam.
('71', 146, 7, 29, 299496) 2 According to Patanjalis Yogasustra, these are: ahimsa (non violence), satya (truth), asteya (non stealing), brahmacharya (celibacy) and aparigraha (non possession).
('71', 147, 0, 1, 299663) 148 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 147, 1, 2, 299705) Second, it has been noticed that some people put their soiled utensils into the drums filled with water.
('71', 147, 1, 3, 299810) This is bad for health and bad according to tradition.
('71', 147, 1, 4, 299865) Third, those who serve are sometimes seen to serve liquids with their hands instead of with ladles.
('71', 147, 1, 5, 299965) We should always serve liquids with a spoon or a ladle.
('71', 147, 1, 6, 300021) Devotees of Truth should pay attention to small things.
('71', 147, 1, 7, 300077) If they do not, they are lazy and laziness is a form of violence.
('71', 147, 1, 8, 300143) Now take the subject under consideration.
('71', 147, 1, 9, 300185) It is a good thing that this discussion is taking place.
('71', 147, 1, 10, 300242) I have myself been confused and I am still not very clear.
('71', 147, 1, 11, 300301) I do not wholly agree with what Gangadharrao 1
('71', 147, 2, 12, 300348) and Acharya Bhagwat have said: It is of course correct that a man cannot go by his own opinion in everything.
('71', 147, 2, 13, 300458) Where we are not sure of the correctness of our opinion we should consult our elders.
('71', 147, 2, 14, 300544) The consultation is necessary.
('71', 147, 2, 15, 300575) But it is not so here.
('71', 147, 2, 16, 300598) I myself wanted to know your opinion as to whether we should go into Legislatures.
('71', 147, 2, 17, 300681) This is not something which we should decide for all time.
('71', 147, 2, 18, 300740) I know that my opposition to going into Legislatures has not considerably softened.
('71', 147, 2, 19, 300824) But there has been no loss of principle here.
('71', 147, 2, 20, 300870) And where there is no loss of principle involved I like to know what peoples wishes are.
('71', 147, 2, 21, 300959) I am a worshipper of Truth and I am also a servant of the people.
('71', 147, 2, 22, 301025) I am affected by the atmosphere.
('71', 147, 2, 23, 301058) My response is generally in conformity with the atmosphere.
('71', 147, 2, 24, 301118) What I said at Patna was correct for the time.
('71', 147, 2, 25, 301165) What I said at Faizpur was also correct.
('71', 147, 2, 26, 301206) I keep myself equipped for meeting the needs of the season.
('71', 147, 2, 27, 301266) If it rains I use an umbrella, if it is cold I can wrap myself in woollens and in summer there is muslin which is light as air or some such thing to cover me.
('71', 147, 2, 28, 301425) People have agreed that this is right.
('71', 147, 2, 29, 301464) There has been no change in my ideas.
('71', 147, 2, 30, 301502) But I express them in keeping with the prevailing wind.
('71', 147, 2, 31, 301558) Now I take the question Kakasaheb has posed.
('71', 147, 2, 32, 301603) He asks whether I am the same man who had advocated non co operation from 1920 to 1922 or whether I have changed.
('71', 147, 2, 33, 301717) My answer is that I am the same man.
('71', 147, 2, 34, 301754) If I was a non co operator then, I am a non co operator now.
('71', 147, 2, 35, 301815) But the fact is that even at that time I was in reality a co operator.
('71', 147, 2, 36, 301886) A British magistrate had told me that, though I showed myself as a non co operator, at heart I sought co operation I told him that he was right.
('71', 147, 2, 37, 302031) Non co operation is not something I have accepted for all time.
('71', 147, 2, 38, 302095) When I find that India can advance through co operation, I will accept
('71', 147, 3, 39, 302166) 1 Gangadharrao Deshpande, also known as Karnataka Kesari
('71', 148, 0, 1, 302223) VOL.71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 149
('71', 148, 1, 2, 302266) co operation.
('71', 148, 1, 3, 302280) Following my 21day 1 fast I had said in a statement that co operation was my religion and that I would die for co operation provided I got it with honour.
('71', 148, 2, 4, 302435) Today We are going into the Legislatures not to give but to take co operation.
('71', 148, 2, 5, 302514) The atmosphere today is changed.
('71', 148, 2, 6, 302547) We will have to seek remedies to suit the change in the atmosphere.
('71', 148, 2, 7, 302615) I must refer here to something Premabehn said 2 yesterday.
('71', 148, 2, 8, 302674) Whether she said it in jest or as sacrasm does not matter.
('71', 148, 2, 9, 302733) But I cannot understand what kind of jest it was.
('71', 148, 2, 10, 302783) It was no occasion for jest.
('71', 148, 2, 11, 302812) I could only conclude that she said it out of her experience.
('71', 148, 2, 12, 302874) If that was so, it is not right.
('71', 148, 2, 13, 302907) My own experience is the opposite.
('71', 148, 2, 14, 302942) I have not become what I am in the sense it has been suggested.
('71', 148, 2, 15, 303006) Truth came to me when I was yet an infant.
('71', 148, 2, 16, 303049) Ahimsa came to me when I was eighteen.
('71', 148, 2, 17, 303088) My intellect was not mature then.
('71', 148, 2, 18, 303122) Even today I do not pride myself on my intellect.
('71', 148, 2, 19, 303172) At school the teachers did not consider me a very bright boy.
('71', 148, 2, 20, 303234) They knew I was a good boy, but not a bright boy.
('71', 148, 2, 21, 303284) I never knew first class and second class.
('71', 148, 2, 22, 303327) I barely passed.
('71', 148, 2, 23, 303344) I was a dull boy.
('71', 148, 2, 24, 303362) I could not even speak properly.
('71', 148, 2, 25, 303395) Even when I went to South Africa I went ony as a clerk.
('71', 148, 2, 26, 303451) I did not go anywhere, like Pherozeshah Mehta, charging a thousand rupees as days fee.
('71', 148, 2, 27, 303538) I was to get  150 annually.
('71', 148, 2, 28, 303566) My knowledge of rules and regulations was nil.
('71', 148, 2, 29, 303613) I am not a learned man.
('71', 148, 2, 30, 303637) I am a worshipper of Truth.
('71', 148, 2, 31, 303665) In South Africa I found myself in the midst of Muslims.
('71', 148, 2, 32, 303721) Mohammed I know only as a name.
('71', 148, 2, 33, 303753) About Muslims I knew nothing.
('71', 148, 2, 34, 303783) I told them the story of Harishchandra.
('71', 148, 2, 35, 303823) Even this absurdity influenced them a great deal.
('71', 148, 2, 36, 303873) Much later I took to politics.
('71', 148, 2, 37, 303904) But the groundwork had been laid much before.
('71', 148, 2, 38, 303950) When I saw that in the interests of Truth and non violence I had to take part in politics I did so.
('71', 148, 2, 39, 304050) But my experience is that my influence among people is not because of my political work.
('71', 148, 2, 40, 304139) This is hundred per cent true.
('71', 148, 2, 41, 304170) If at Saswad the experience is different, I do not know.
('71', 148, 2, 42, 304227) But this has been my experience all along.
('71', 148, 2, 43, 304270) I went to Champaran also at the request of
('71', 148, 3, 44, 304313) 1 From May 8 to 29 1933 2 She had spoken on the question of members of the Gandhi Seva Sangh standing for election to the Legislativve Councils.
('71', 148, 3, 45, 304458) On Gandhijis explaining to her that her thoughts were immature, she had resolved not to make any public speech for a year.
('71', 148, 3, 46, 304581) Vide also Letter to Premabehn Kantak.,13 5 1937.
('71', 149, 0, 1, 304630) 150 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 149, 1, 2, 304672) Brijkrishore Babu 1. I had merely seen him.
('71', 149, 1, 3, 304716) People also knew him only as a lawyer.
('71', 149, 1, 4, 304755) He had not even heard of the Congress.
('71', 149, 1, 5, 304794) I told them all not even to mention the Congress.
('71', 149, 1, 6, 304844) Rajendra Babu never even dreamt of bringing him into the Congress.
('71', 149, 1, 7, 304911) This occured to me later.
('71', 149, 1, 8, 304937) Even today there are thousands in India who have no need of swaraj.
('71', 149, 1, 9, 305005) Take Segaon itself, where I live.
('71', 149, 1, 10, 305039) It is in Maharashtra and people in Maharashtra are very political minded.
('71', 149, 1, 11, 305113) But even they dont ask for swaraj.
('71', 149, 1, 12, 305148) I do not mention Congress to them, because they will not understand it.
('71', 149, 1, 13, 305220) They understand the question of untouchability and they also oppose untouchability.
('71', 149, 1, 14, 305304) To women I talk about the charkha, about children.
('71', 149, 1, 15, 305355) If I speak to them about the Legislatures they may ask me if I would bring them a couple of bags of foodgrains from there.
('71', 149, 1, 16, 305478) What is the condition of India as a whole today?
('71', 149, 1, 17, 305527) The talk of bread is all that the people understand.
('71', 149, 1, 18, 305580) They have no use for politics.
('71', 149, 1, 19, 305611) I have led campaigns in all parts of India, but never in the name of the Congress.
('71', 149, 1, 20, 305694) Nowhere have I worked in that fashion.
('71', 149, 1, 21, 305733) Today in Champaran people in their thousands talk about the Congress.
('71', 149, 1, 22, 305803) It is the fruit of those six months of work in the course of which the Congress was not so much as mentioned.
('71', 149, 1, 23, 305913) They repect the Congress because they consider these gentlemen their well wishers.
('71', 149, 1, 24, 305996) There may be some amongst you, too, who think that Truth and non violence will advance only through politics.
('71', 149, 1, 25, 306106) I must tell them very clearly that Truth and non violence are not dependent on anything.
('71', 149, 1, 26, 306195) They are independent forces.
('71', 149, 1, 27, 306224) If you want to be the worshippers of what Khan Saheb calls Allah, what I call Rama and Christian call Christ or God, you may do so.
('71', 149, 1, 28, 306356) If you dont wish so, no harm is done to Him.
('71', 149, 1, 29, 306401) If God is independent of you and me, He does not need politics.
('71', 149, 1, 30, 306465) He does not need you and me.
('71', 149, 1, 31, 306494) There are millions who are in quest of Him.
('71', 149, 1, 32, 306538) Very few have had a glimpse of Him.
('71', 149, 1, 33, 306574) I myself have been worshipping him for the last fifty years.
('71', 149, 1, 34, 306635) In Him I find daily new strength, new things.
('71', 149, 1, 35, 306681) If today I find it necessary to argue with you it means that I have not been able to imbibe all these things to the extent I should have.
('71', 149, 1, 36, 306819) What is moral strength?
('71', 149, 1, 37, 306843) Ramanama is the same thing for all.
('71', 149, 1, 38, 306879) But when one man utters the name it makes an impact.
('71', 149, 1, 39, 306932) Anothers uttering makes none.
('71', 149, 1, 40, 306962) What is the reason?
('71', 149, 1, 41, 306982) The reason is that
('71', 149, 2, 42, 307001) 1 Father of Prabhavati
('71', 150, 0, 1, 307024) VOL.71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 151
('71', 150, 1, 2, 307067) one has merged oneself in it.
('71', 150, 1, 3, 307097) Another plays upon it as one might on a sitar or a violin.
('71', 150, 1, 4, 307156) A parrot also utters Ramanama, but it does not touch its heart.
('71', 150, 1, 5, 307220) It cannot understand its significance.
('71', 150, 1, 6, 307259) I am not a worshipper of small things.
('71', 150, 1, 7, 307298) Can a man who has been saying that no man is his guru, who has accepted no living person as his guru, be a worshipper of something that depends on politics?
('71', 150, 1, 8, 307455) Truth and non violence are precious commodities.
('71', 150, 1, 9, 307504) They are neutral; they are unique things and the articles needed for their worship are also unique.
('71', 150, 1, 10, 307604) Let Premabehn not forget all this.
('71', 150, 1, 11, 307639) Jamnalalji has said that if we go into the Legislatures today we cannot pursue Truth and non violence.
('71', 150, 1, 12, 307742) He has uttered something of great import.
('71', 150, 1, 13, 307784) I dont agree with it.
('71', 150, 1, 14, 307806) If Truth and non violence cannot be pursued, then democracy also cannot be practised, for in that case it will be against Truth and non violence.
('71', 150, 1, 15, 307952) If you believe in democracy we shall have to work for the good of the millions.
('71', 150, 1, 16, 308032) To do good to the millions we cannot all of us assemble in one place.
('71', 150, 1, 17, 308102) We shall have to elect a few representatives.
('71', 150, 1, 18, 308148) If they are true servants of the people, if they are true democrats, they will, with a pure heart, try to understand the wishes of the people and will voice them.
('71', 150, 1, 19, 308311) When in 1920 the question arose of amending the objective of the Congress and Bipin Chandra Pal suggested democratic swaraj in place of swaraj, I opposed it because when I analyse swaraj I find that without democracy there can be no swaraj.
('71', 150, 1, 20, 308552) What Pal intended was implied in the word swaraj itself.
('71', 150, 1, 21, 308609) In swaraj, too, the Legislatures will retain more or less their present structure, though it is possible there may be some change in the external form.
('71', 150, 1, 22, 308761) Let us sit as we are sitting here instead of in chairs and palaces.
('71', 150, 1, 23, 308829) About one third of the people who should have the right to vote have acquired the franchise.
('71', 150, 1, 24, 308922) After some time the number ofvoters may reach 120 million.
('71', 150, 1, 25, 308981) It is no small thing that today 30 million people can vote.
('71', 150, 1, 26, 309041) Thousands of our workers have approached them and this had never been done before.
('71', 150, 1, 27, 309124) The Congress message has spread more widely.
('71', 150, 1, 28, 309169) It is not a small thing.
('71', 150, 1, 29, 309194) I had been thinking whether it is right for members of the Gandhi Seva Sangh to carry this message.
('71', 150, 1, 30, 309294) I told those who asked me that there was no harm in doing so.
('71', 150, 1, 31, 309356) So long as there is room in the Congress for Truth and non violence, so long as it does not say good bye to the programme of 1920, we shall continue to be an organ of the Congress.
('71', 150, 1, 32, 309537) We are not an
('71', 151, 0, 1, 309551) 152 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 151, 1, 2, 309593) institution created under the Congress.
('71', 151, 1, 3, 309633) We are a voluntary organization.
('71', 151, 1, 4, 309666) The All India Spinners Association, and All India Village Industries Association are organization created by the Congress.
('71', 151, 1, 5, 309789) But Gandhi Seva Sangh is not created by the Congress.
('71', 151, 1, 6, 309843) It came into existence in 1923 to save the programme of 1920 at a time when I was undergoing six years imprisonment and when there was no talk of my being released.
('71', 151, 1, 7, 310008) Even if the Congress gives up constructive programme tomorrow, the Sangh will not cease to exist.
('71', 151, 1, 8, 310106) It will carry on that programme.
('71', 151, 1, 9, 310139) Constructive programme is the permanent programme of Gandhi Seva Sangh.
('71', 151, 1, 10, 310211) If it gives it up it will cease to be.
('71', 151, 1, 11, 310250) In 1923 Motilalji and other leaders had taken the Councils programme in hand.
('71', 151, 1, 12, 310328) It was not for us to quarrel with them.
('71', 151, 1, 13, 310368) We also had to keep intact this real programme of the Congress because I know that if the Congress gives up the programme of 1920, it will be destroyed.
('71', 151, 1, 14, 310521) What else could we have done in such a situation?
('71', 151, 1, 15, 310571) Today also I say that there is no other programme besides this.
('71', 151, 1, 16, 310635) But constructive programme is not like Truth and non violence valid for all time.
('71', 151, 1, 17, 310717) Take the charkha.
('71', 151, 1, 18, 310735) If you go to the North Pole or to the Himalayan peaks or to Tibet, the talk of cotton wont do.
('71', 151, 1, 19, 310830) Still I say that the constructive programme is for the good of our millions.
('71', 151, 1, 20, 310907) Legislatures are only for a few.
('71', 151, 1, 21, 310940) But the contructive programme is for all.
('71', 151, 1, 22, 310982) Therefore it is right for me to stay with the thirty crores who stand appart from the three crore.
('71', 151, 1, 23, 311081) Only a few will go, can go, into the Legislatures.
('71', 151, 1, 24, 311132) I have told people who have written to me asking my advice not to get themeselves into this.
('71', 151, 1, 25, 311225) But they did the very opposite saying they couldnt help it.
('71', 151, 1, 26, 311285) Sardar took away forcibly even those people whom we wanted to keep.
('71', 151, 1, 27, 311353) The example of Dr. Gopichand of the Punjab is before you.
('71', 151, 1, 28, 311411) The same thing happened with others.
('71', 151, 1, 29, 311448) Sardar was responsible for this betrayal.
('71', 151, 1, 30, 311490) I had to say that what he had done was right.
('71', 151, 1, 31, 311536) If he had not done it he would have been defeated at any rate in Gujarat.
('71', 151, 1, 32, 311610) If I had told Rajaji not to go, he would not havegone.
('71', 151, 1, 33, 311665) But if today I am asked, I shall say that what he did was right.
('71', 151, 1, 34, 311730) The matter has an interesting history.
('71', 151, 1, 35, 311769) Rajaji asked my opinion, but after going, not before.
('71', 151, 1, 36, 311823) He considered it his duty to go and he went.
('71', 151, 1, 37, 311868) I said I did not like it.
('71', 151, 1, 38, 311894) But he did the right thing.
('71', 151, 1, 39, 311922) Much work has been done in Madras.
('71', 151, 1, 40, 311957) The workers there are members of the Spinners Association.
('71', 151, 1, 41, 312016) Most of the work was done through them.
('71', 152, 0, 1, 312056) VOL.71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 153
('71', 152, 1, 2, 312099) Today Rajagopalachari has left.
('71', 152, 1, 3, 312131) Tomorrow if I ask Sardar Vallabhbhai, Rajendra Babu or Jamnalalji, they may also leave.
('71', 152, 1, 4, 312219) But then our Sangh will be reduced into a small band.
('71', 152, 1, 5, 312273) We want that everyone should become a member of the Sangh.
('71', 152, 1, 6, 312332) But thequestion before me today is, if we stop everyone who is with us from going into the Conuncils, will it not harm our own work?
('71', 152, 1, 7, 312465) For where will the Congress find men?
('71', 152, 1, 8, 312503) And members of the Gandhi Seva Sangh did just this.
('71', 152, 1, 9, 312555) I feel that they have done their duty.
('71', 152, 1, 10, 312594) If they had not done so the Congress would not have been victorious in the same degree as it is.
('71', 152, 1, 11, 312691) The Sangh is of no importance as compared with the Congress.
('71', 152, 1, 12, 312752) The Congress is of the millions.
('71', 152, 1, 13, 312785) We cannot leave it.
('71', 152, 1, 14, 312805) It has accepted this programme on a permanent basis.
('71', 152, 1, 15, 312858) It is not that they have accepted it under duress.
('71', 152, 1, 16, 312909) The thing is clear before us.
('71', 152, 1, 17, 312939) We cannot give it up.
('71', 152, 1, 18, 312961) Those who go into the Legislatures today do not go in to Governments Legislatures.
('71', 152, 1, 19, 313044) They go into their own Legislatures.
('71', 152, 1, 20, 313081) What I have said is the truth.
('71', 152, 1, 21, 313112) We have become the representatives of the people.
('71', 152, 1, 22, 313162) Formerly only the representatives of the Government or of a handful of people went into the Legislatures.
('71', 152, 1, 23, 313268) The eprentatives of the people have laid down their condition before the Government.
('71', 152, 1, 24, 313353) If Truth and non violence have to be practised in Legislatures, who will do so if not you?
('71', 152, 1, 25, 313444) We have to increase the strength of the Congress.
('71', 152, 1, 26, 313494) You may ask, well, why in that case have I gone out of the Congress?
('71', 152, 1, 27, 313563) If I have gone out of the Congress, it is in order to be able to serve it better.
('71', 152, 1, 28, 313645) So long as the Congress needs my services I shall continue to render them.
('71', 152, 1, 29, 313720) I do not feel any isappointment.
('71', 152, 1, 30, 313753) I have not gone to settle in Segaon out of any frustration.
('71', 152, 1, 31, 313813) Whatever little strength I have is for the Congress.
('71', 152, 1, 32, 313866) The Congress is mine.
('71', 152, 1, 33, 313888) The ideas I am placing before you have been influenced by the opinions of you all.
('71', 152, 1, 34, 313971) In brief, what I wish to say is that we have to find a place for this programme.
('71', 152, 1, 35, 314052) But the estriction is that we shall continue our own work till then.
('71', 152, 1, 36, 314121) If our leader, Kishorelalnot Vallabhbhaiorders us, we shall go into the Councils also.
('71', 152, 1, 37, 314208) Dharmadhikari asks whether as satyagrahis we can enter institutions opposed to us to voice our opposition there.
('71', 152, 1, 38, 314321) Yes, why shouldnt we?
('71', 152, 1, 39, 314343) But you must always remember the limits of satyagraha.
('71', 152, 1, 40, 314398) We shall not go to betray or to offer violence.
('71', 152, 1, 41, 314446) It may even be our duty to go in order to offer our open opposition.
('71', 152, 1, 42, 314515) But here this is not the question.
('71', 152, 1, 43, 314550) Legislatures are not institutions opposed to us.
('71', 152, 1, 44, 314599) I like Legislatures.
('71', 152, 1, 45, 314620) They are mine.
('71', 152, 1, 46, 314635) The Governor has been made the
('71', 153, 0, 1, 314666) 154 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 153, 1, 2, 314708) But the institution is mine.
('71', 153, 1, 3, 314737) The Governor of Orissa knows this.
('71', 153, 1, 4, 314772) With the help of Legislatures I wish to destroy this system.
('71', 153, 1, 5, 314833) We are going into the Legislatures to gain strength.
('71', 153, 1, 6, 314886) We are not going into the Legislatures to paralyse them.
('71', 153, 1, 7, 314943) We go even to our enemy in order to change his heart.
('71', 153, 1, 8, 314997) Supposing there is a meeting of drunkards and it invites us to go and speak on the evils of drinking.
('71', 153, 1, 9, 315099) We shall certainly go.
('71', 153, 1, 10, 315122) Someone may say they may burn us.
('71', 153, 1, 11, 315156) Well, what of it?
('71', 153, 1, 12, 315174) We shall die.
('71', 153, 1, 13, 315188) What is important is, why we go.
('71', 153, 1, 14, 315221) Do we go to advance Truth or to obstruct it?
('71', 153, 1, 15, 315266) Let us go into the Legislatures to pursue Truth.
('71', 153, 1, 16, 315315) After all the Legislatures are ours.
('71', 153, 1, 17, 315352) Arent they?
('71', 153, 1, 18, 315364) The majority there is ours.
('71', 153, 1, 19, 315392) Now that we have an opportunity to accept the challenge, shall we stay out?
('71', 153, 1, 20, 315468) When we can openly go into the arena to meet our enemy, why shouldnt we?
('71', 153, 1, 21, 315541) We do not go to beg, but to sap the enemys strength.
('71', 153, 1, 22, 315594) Have we spent five lakhs or seven lakhs of rupees for nothing?
('71', 153, 1, 23, 315657) Today we have had to spend all this money.
('71', 153, 1, 24, 315700) When the Congress has risen in peoples esteem we will not have to spend even a cowrie.
('71', 153, 1, 25, 315787) We boast of a constructive programme.
('71', 153, 1, 26, 315825) I have been shouting in the pages of Harijan, how many charkha graduates are there?
('71', 153, 1, 27, 315909) How many graduates for removal of untouchability?
('71', 153, 1, 28, 315959) The answer is zero.
('71', 153, 1, 29, 315979) Had conditions been different, the question of spending anything would never have arisen.
('71', 153, 1, 30, 316069) We have to mobilize all our energies in order to serve.We have to march fully observing Truth and non violence.
('71', 153, 1, 31, 316181) We must always be armed with the two weapons of fearlessness and discipline.
('71', 153, 1, 32, 316258) We will have to use them in Parliament.
('71', 153, 1, 33, 316298) Carlyle once said that members of the House of Commons had not much need of common sense.
('71', 153, 1, 34, 316388) This is bound to be so where there is democracy.
('71', 153, 1, 35, 316437) The main thing a discipline.
('71', 153, 1, 36, 316466) Obey your leader and ply your taklis there in silence.
('71', 153, 1, 37, 316521) We need just such men.
('71', 153, 1, 38, 316544) They need no legal or constitutional knowledge.
('71', 153, 1, 39, 316592) Why should we not go into our own house?
('71', 153, 1, 40, 316633) It is true everyone cannot go.
('71', 153, 1, 41, 316664) Still everyone has to vote.
('71', 153, 1, 42, 316692) I do not agree with Appa.
('71', 153, 1, 43, 316718) Everybody has to be a primary voter.
('71', 153, 1, 44, 316755) You may ask me why I have not become a voter.
('71', 153, 1, 45, 316801) That is for a different reason.
('71', 153, 1, 46, 316833) Not that I have not been given the right to vote, only I did not want to be a voter.
('71', 153, 1, 47, 316918) My position is different and it is valid only for myself.
('71', 153, 1, 48, 316976) The members of the Sangh are votaries of Truth.
('71', 153, 1, 49, 317024) He whom the Gandhi Seva Sangh orders to go will go.
('71', 153, 1, 50, 317076) The question is not of individuals.
('71', 153, 1, 51, 317112) It is not a question of temptation of self interest.
('71', 153, 1, 52, 317165) He who goes there out or greed or self interest will be or brtraying not only the Gandhi Seva Sangh but also Truth.
('71', 153, 1, 53, 317281) He who thinks of the charkha all the 24 hours can do so in the Legislatures also.
('71', 153, 1, 54, 317363) He does not have to exercise his mind there.
('71', 153, 1, 55, 317408) He has merely to raise his band at a signal from his leader.
('71', 153, 1, 56, 317469) It is not a predicament.
('71', 153, 1, 57, 317494) It is our dharma.
('71', 153, 1, 58, 317512) We are the servants of Daridranarayana.
('71', 153, 1, 59, 317552) We shall go there as servants and if the Congress
('71', 154, 0, 1, 317602) VOL.71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 155
('71', 154, 1, 2, 317645) gives the call.
('71', 154, 1, 3, 317661) If we can form ministeries on our own conditions, then we have found the way to swaraj.
('71', 154, 1, 4, 317749) If such men go into the Legislatures, we shall not meet with defeat even in one of the eleven provinces.
('71', 154, 1, 5, 317854) If the Congress does not call us we should remain where we are.
('71', 154, 1, 6, 317918) This is not a question of superior or inferior.
('71', 154, 1, 7, 317966) The constructive programme and this programme are both equal.
('71', 154, 2, 8, 318028) As regards the oath of allegiance, I should ask no one to go there who has a conscientious objection to the oath.
('71', 154, 2, 9, 318142) It is not a religious oath, so far as I understand the constitution, and it is wholly consistent with the demand for immediate and concrete independence.

('71', 154, 5, 13, 318411) At the instance of Sardar, Shrimati Bhaktibehn 2 Shri Ashabhai, Shri Ravishankar 3, who is the priest of the Dharalas and the Baraiyas, and Shri Ravjibhai 4 approached me on behalf of the Kaira district.
('71', 154, 5, 14, 318615) Sardar also happened to be present.
('71', 154, 5, 15, 318651) These representatives had heard that I was inclined to hold the Congress session in the Bardoli taluk.
('71', 154, 5, 16, 318754) I had read the report of the enquiry committee.
('71', 154, 5, 17, 318802) After a long and friendly discussion, I think I was able to persuade the representatives to shift the venue of the Congress session to the Bardoli taluk.
('71', 154, 5, 18, 318956) I had only one strong argument to support me.
('71', 154, 5, 19, 319002) Kaira is a strong district.
('71', 154, 5, 20, 319030) No one is ignorant of the sacrifice made by Ras.
('71', 154, 5, 21, 319079) I also believe that Ras would do credit to whatever task it takes upon itself.
('71', 154, 5, 22, 319158) However, when other districts or taluks wish to compete, it is the dharma of the strong competitor to withdraw in favour of the weak.
('71', 154, 5, 23, 319292) I suggested such a sacrifice to the representatives, and they accepted my proposal.
('71', 154, 5, 24, 319376) When Darbar Saheb heard of this decision, he was annoyed and he wrote to me an affectionate but strongly worded letter in which he justified by many arguments the worthiness of the Kaira district.
('71', 154, 5, 25, 319573) I would give only one reply to those who hold such a view: If you wish to add to the strength of the Congress, i.e., of Gujarat, will you allow those who are weak to become strong, or allow those who are strong to become even more so?
('71', 154, 5, 26, 319808) Ras has become more famous for its strength in the already strong Kaira district.
('71', 154, 5, 27, 319890) Hence the above
('71', 154, 6, 28, 319906) 1 What follows is from Harijan, 1 5 1937 2 Bhaktiba, wife of Darbar Gopaldas Desai 3 Ravishankar Vyas, popularly known as Ravishankar Maharaj 4 Raojibhai Patel
('71', 155, 0, 1, 320066) 156 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 155, 1, 2, 320108) was my first and final reply to the supporters of Ras.
('71', 155, 1, 3, 320163) Many other things were discussed in the mean time because, where many side issues have to be considered, a single consideration does not make a person act; there are many factorspalpable and less palpablethat must be considered.
('71', 155, 1, 4, 320392) In whichever village of Gujarat the Congress is held, all Gujaratis have to work for it on the understanding that it is being held in Gujarat taken as a whole.
('71', 155, 1, 5, 320552) The most important task at the annual session of the Congress should be to make the exhibition impressive.
('71', 155, 1, 6, 320659) It is an indispensable part of the session.
('71', 155, 1, 7, 320703) We increase our efficiency by organizing a beautiful exhibition; hundreds of thousands of persons get valuable training; the entire rural area becomes revitalized as our primary purpose is to encourage cottage industries.
('71', 155, 1, 8, 320925) Hence I hope that Gujaratis will forget that the Congress is to be held in the Bardoli taluk and keep reminding themselves that it is to be held in Gujarat and use all their energies in consolidating the constructive work of the Congress.
('71', 155, 1, 9, 321164) Gujarat is backward in many matters.
('71', 155, 1, 10, 321201) In one matter it lags behind all other Provincesin abolishing untouchability.
('71', 155, 1, 11, 321279) The caste discrimination which is practised here is not seen in any other Provinces.
('71', 155, 1, 12, 321364) That kind of discrimination should be totally done away with.
('71', 155, 1, 13, 321426) Gujarat also falls behind other Provinces in so far as the production of khadi is concerned.
('71', 155, 1, 14, 321519) In fact Bardoli had taken the pledge that within six months the spinning wheel would ply in every home and no other cloth but khadi would be used there and untouchability would be totally wiped out.
('71', 155, 1, 15, 321718) Will Bardoli and the entire people of Gujarat start making preparation from today so that khadi would be really introduced?
('71', 155, 1, 16, 321842) Hundreds of thousands of rupees are spent by Gujarat in the name of goseva but does anybody know the value of mother cow?
('71', 155, 1, 17, 321964) How much cows milk is produced?
('71', 155, 1, 18, 321996) And how much difficulty is experienced in selling what little is produced!
('71', 155, 1, 19, 322071) It is Sardars pledge to supply cows milk to everyone at the Congress session.
('71', 155, 1, 20, 322149) If that pledge is to be kept, Bardoli taluk should start collecting cows right now and an exhibition of cows and bullocks, the like of which has never been seen, should be held at the time of the Congress session.
('71', 155, 1, 21, 322363) Moreover, Surat district is notorious for drinking.
('71', 155, 1, 22, 322415) If the evil is totally given up in that district before the Congress session, that would be a very creditable achievement.
('71', 155, 1, 23, 322538) Women can play an important role in all these tasks.
('71', 155, 1, 24, 322591) Will they do so?
('71', 155, 1, 25, 322608) Will the Patidars, the Dharalas, Baraiyas, Thakores, whatever you call them, plunge into the tasks I have mentioned, looking upon the holding of the Congress in Bardoli taluk as if it was being held in the Kaira district or in Ras itself?
('71', 155, 1, 26, 322847) The sacrifice of Ras is great; so is its renown.
('71', 155, 1, 27, 322896) If, despite the
('71', 156, 0, 1, 322912) VOL.71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 157
('71', 156, 1, 2, 322955) Congress not being held there, Ras makes its own handsome contribution, it will add to its own prestige and to that extent strengthen itself also.

('71', 156, 3, 5, 323182) HUDLI, [April 18, 1937] 2
('71', 156, 4, 6, 323208) You must know that I do not believe in ceremonies, except to the extent that they awaken in us a sense of duty.
('71', 156, 4, 7, 323320) I have had that attitude of mind ever since I began to think for myself.
('71', 156, 4, 8, 323393) The mantras you have repeated and the vows you have taken were all in Sanskrit, but they were all translated for you.
('71', 156, 4, 9, 323511) We had the Sanskrit text because I know that the Sanskrit word has a power under the influence of which one would love to come.
('71', 156, 4, 10, 323639) One of the wishes expressed by the husband during the ceremony is that the bride may be the mother of a good and healthy son.
('71', 156, 4, 11, 323765) The wish did not shock me.
('71', 156, 4, 12, 323792) It does not mean that procreation is obligatory but means that if progeny is wanted, marriage performed in a strictly religious spirit is essential.
('71', 156, 4, 13, 323941) He who does not want a child need not marry at all.
('71', 156, 4, 14, 323993) Marriage for the satisfaction of sexual appetite is no marriage.
('71', 156, 4, 15, 324058) It is Vyabhicharaconcupiscence.
('71', 156, 4, 16, 324090) Todays ceremony, therefore, means that the sexual act is permitted only when there is a clear desire by both for a child.
('71', 156, 4, 17, 324212) The whole conception is sacred.
('71', 156, 4, 18, 324244) The act has therefore to be performed prayerfully.
('71', 156, 4, 19, 324295) It is not preceded by the usual courtship designed to provide sexual excitement and pleasure.
('71', 156, 4, 20, 324389) Such union may only be once in a lifetime, if no other child is desired.
('71', 156, 4, 21, 324462) Those who are not morally and physically healthy have no business to unite, and if they do, it is vyabhicharaconcupiscence.
('71', 156, 4, 22, 324586) You must unlearn the lesson, if you have learnt it before, that marriage is for the satisfaction of animal appetite.
('71', 156, 4, 23, 324703) It is a superstition.
('71', 156, 4, 24, 324725) The whole ceremony is performed in the presence of the sacred fire.
('71', 156, 4, 25, 324793) Let the fire make ashes of all the lust in you.
('71', 156, 4, 26, 324841) I would also ask you to disabuse yourselves of another
('71', 156, 5, 27, 324896) 1 Extracted from Mahadev Desais Weekly Letter.
('71', 156, 5, 28, 324943) The newly married couples were Manu and Surendra Mashruwala, and Nirmala and Ishwardas.
('71', 156, 5, 29, 325031) The weddings took place on the same day.
('71', 156, 5, 30, 325072) All outward show and ceremony was eschewed, no invitations to friends or relations were issued .

('71', 157, 1, 2, 325292) superstition which is rampant nowadays.
('71', 157, 1, 3, 325332) It is being said that restraint and abstinence are wrong and free satisfaction of the sexual appetite and free love is the most natural thing.
('71', 157, 1, 4, 325475) There was never a more ruinous superstition.
('71', 157, 1, 5, 325520) You may be incapable of attaining the ideal, your flesh may be weak, but do not therefore lower the ideal, do not make irreligion your religion.
('71', 157, 1, 6, 325665) In your weak moments remember what I am telling you.
('71', 157, 1, 7, 325718) The remembrance of this solemn occasion may well steady and restrain you.
('71', 157, 1, 8, 325792) The very purpose of marriage is restraint and sublimation of the sexual passion.
('71', 157, 1, 9, 325873) If there is any other purpose, marriage is no consecration, but marriage for other purposes besides having progeny.
('71', 157, 1, 10, 325989) You are being united in marriage as friends and equals.
('71', 157, 1, 11, 326045) If the husband is called swamin, the wife is swaminieach master of the other, each helpmate of the other, each co operating with the other in the performance of lifes tasks and duties.
('71', 157, 1, 12, 326230) To you boys I would say that if you are gifted with better intellects and richer emotions, infect the girls with them.
('71', 157, 1, 13, 326349) Be their true teachers and guides, help them and guide them, but never hinder them or misguide them.
('71', 157, 1, 14, 326450) Let there be complete harmony of thought and word and deed between you, may you have no secrets from each other, may you be one in soul.
('71', 157, 1, 15, 326587) Dont be hypocrites, dont break your health in the vain effort of performing what may be impossible for you.
('71', 157, 1, 16, 326695) Restraint never ruins ones health.
('71', 157, 1, 17, 326730) What ruins ones health is not restraint but outward suppression.
('71', 157, 1, 18, 326795) A really self restrained person grows every day from strength to strength and from peace to more peace.
('71', 157, 1, 19, 326899) The very first step in self restraint is the restraint of thoughts.
('71', 157, 1, 20, 326967) Understand your limitations and do only as much as you can.
('71', 157, 1, 21, 327027) I have placed the ideal before youthe right angle.
('71', 157, 1, 22, 327078) Try as best as you can to attain the right angle.
('71', 157, 1, 23, 327128) But if you fail, there is no cause for grief or shame.
('71', 157, 1, 24, 327183) I have simply explained to you that marriage is consecration, a new birth, even as the sacred thread ceremony is a consecration and a new birth.
('71', 157, 1, 25, 327328) Let not what I have told you alarm you or weaken you.
('71', 157, 1, 26, 327382) Always aim at complete harmony of thought and word and deed.
('71', 157, 1, 27, 327443) Always aim at purifying your thoughts and everything will be well.
('71', 157, 1, 28, 327510) There is nothing more potent than thought.
('71', 157, 1, 29, 327553) Deed follows word and word follows thought.
('71', 157, 1, 30, 327597) The world is the result of a mighty thought, and where the thought is mighty and pure the result is always mighty and pure.
('71', 157, 1, 31, 327721) I want you to go hence armed with the armour of a noble ideal, and I assure you no temptation can harm you, no impurity can touch you.
('71', 157, 1, 32, 327856) Remember the various ceremonies that have been explained to you.
('71', 157, 1, 33, 327921) Look at the simple looking ceremony of madhuparka.
('71', 157, 1, 34, 327972) The whole world is full of madhusweet nectar or honeyif only you will partake of it after the rest of the world has taken its share of it.

('71', 158, 1, 2, 328154) means enjoyment by means of renunciation.
('71', 158, 1, 3, 328196) QUESTION: But if there is no desire for progeny, should there be no marriage?
('71', 158, 2, 4, 328274) ANSWER: Certainly not.
('71', 158, 2, 5, 328297) I do not believe in Platonic marriages.
('71', 158, 2, 6, 328337) In certain rare cases men are known to have married women to protect the latter and not for any physical union at all.
('71', 158, 2, 7, 328456) But those cases are very rare indeed.
('71', 158, 2, 8, 328494) You must read all that I have written on pure married life.
('71', 158, 2, 9, 328554) What I read in the Mahabharata is daily growing upon me.
('71', 158, 2, 10, 328611) Vyasa is described therein as having performed niyoga.
('71', 158, 2, 11, 328666) He is not described as beautiful, but he was the reverse of it.
('71', 158, 2, 12, 328730) His form is represented as terrible, he made no amorous gestures, but he smeared his whole body with ghee before he performed the union.
('71', 158, 2, 13, 328867) He performed the act not for lust but for procreation.
('71', 158, 2, 14, 328922) The desire for a child is perfectly natural, and once the desire is satisfied there should be no union 1. Nurturing carnal desires is a transgression of the law.
('71', 158, 2, 15, 329084) The desire for progeny is a natural desire.
('71', 158, 2, 16, 329128) In woman, one finds that there is a desire to become a mother.
('71', 158, 2, 17, 329191) That desire is not the same as sexual desire.
('71', 158, 2, 18, 329237) Anyone who wishes to become a mother, once she has had sexual intercourse, will have no further desire for it.
('71', 158, 2, 19, 329348) She will keep thinking only of her child, she will make efforts to see that her child is healthy, free from any diseases and is born with the best possible sanskaras 2. This natural rule is practised among animals as well.
('71', 158, 2, 20, 329571) The reason why lustfulness is increasing in the world is that no one is aware of this kind of marriage.
('71', 158, 2, 21, 329675) This pure dharma is not difficult to practise.
('71', 158, 2, 22, 329722) Just as even dry roti arouses the interest of anyone who is hungry, similarly, the practice of dharma, self control, also becomes interesting.Anyone who practises self restraint finds it easy to develop his other senses.
('71', 158, 2, 23, 329943) Manu calls the first son alone dharmaja, all the rest are kamaja (born out of desire).
('71', 158, 2, 24, 330030) Our Shastras have been written from experience, not for the sake of writing.
('71', 158, 2, 25, 330107) The practice of seemingly difficult rules (laws) would become easy if we keep purifying our thoughts and practising these.
('71', 158, 2, 26, 330230) That gives in a nutshell the law of sexual relations.
('71', 158, 2, 27, 330284) And what is God but the Law?
('71', 158, 2, 28, 330313) And to obey God is to perform the Law.
('71', 158, 2, 29, 330352) Remember that you were thrice asked to repeat: I will not transgress the Law in any respect. Even if we had a handful of men and women prepared to abide by the Law, we should have a race of men and women stalwart and true.

('71', 159, 1, 2, 330777) ceased to look at Ba sexually.
('71', 159, 1, 3, 330808) I took the vow of abstinence when I was in the prime of youth and health, when I was young enough to enjoy married life in the accepted sense of the term.
('71', 159, 1, 4, 330963) I saw in a flash that I was born, as we all are, for a sacred mission.
('71', 159, 1, 5, 331034) I did not know this when I was married.
('71', 159, 1, 6, 331074) But on coming to my senses I felt that I must see that the marriage subserved the mission for which I was born.
('71', 159, 1, 7, 331186) Then indeed did I realize true dharma.
('71', 159, 1, 8, 331225) True happiness came into our lives only after the vow was taken.
('71', 159, 2, 9, 331290) That dharma of restraint can only be practised when all the things which nurture sexual desires are renounced, when sharing the same bed as well as suggestive gestures are eschewed.
('71', 159, 2, 10, 331472) I realized all this when I became awakened.
('71', 159, 2, 11, 331516) If the satisfying of sexual desires is not the purpose of marriage, what then is its purpose?
('71', 159, 2, 12, 331610) I realized that public service was the answer to this question and I was also able to convince Ba of this.
('71', 159, 2, 13, 331717) Although she is illiterate she stood beside me in all that I did and became the object of praise, not because of me but in her ownright.
('71', 159, 2, 14, 331854) She may look frail but at the age of sixty nine she can keep toiling day and night.
('71', 159, 2, 15, 331938) If, however, we had given in to sexual craving, what would have been our plight?
('71', 159, 2, 16, 332019) And yet I woke up late in the sense that I had lived the married life for some years.
('71', 159, 2, 17, 332105) You are lucky enough to be aroused in good time.
('71', 159, 2, 18, 332154) Circumstances when I was married were as unpropitious as they could be.
('71', 159, 2, 19, 332226) For you they are as propitious as they could be.
('71', 159, 2, 20, 332275) There was one thing though that I possessed and that carried me through.
('71', 159, 2, 21, 332348) It was the armour of truth.
('71', 159, 2, 22, 332376) That protected me and saved me.
('71', 159, 2, 23, 332408) Truth has been the very foundation of my life.
('71', 159, 2, 24, 332455) Brahmacharya and ahimsa were born later out of truth.
('71', 159, 2, 25, 332509) Whatever, therefore, you do, be true to yourselves and to the world.
('71', 159, 2, 26, 332578) Hide not your thoughts.
('71', 159, 2, 27, 332602) If it is shameful to reveal them, it is more shameful to think them.

('71', 159, 5, 31, 332830) What does the word dwija mean?
('71', 159, 5, 32, 332861) It means twice born.
('71', 159, 5, 33, 332882) Today you have taken a new birth, so you have acquired knowledge today of which you were ignorant so far.
('71', 159, 5, 34, 332988) The shastri has told you that you are now worthy of studying the Vedas.

('71', 160, 1, 2, 333262) fuller meaning of studying of the Vedas is a life in conformity with dharma.
('71', 160, 1, 3, 333339) So far your life was devoid of the consciousness of dharma and adharma but now you have acquired that consciousness.
('71', 160, 1, 4, 333456) During a famine, the sage Vishwamitra stole meat out of hunger.
('71', 160, 1, 5, 333520) Having done that, he had to perform many ceremonies before eating it.
('71', 160, 1, 6, 333590) No meal can be taken without taking a bath and performing the sandhya.
('71', 160, 1, 7, 333661) Hence he began these ceremonies.
('71', 160, 1, 8, 333694) But, while in the middle of these activities, he realized how low he had fallen!
('71', 160, 1, 9, 333775) He had committed theft merely to appease his stomach, and that too of meat.
('71', 160, 1, 10, 333851) He who was satisfied with fruit and vegetables and had reached the vanaprastha stage of his life had coveted meat!These thoughts made him aware of his dharma.
('71', 160, 1, 11, 334010) He took the piece of meat back to the butcher from whom he had stolen it and begged forgiveness.
('71', 160, 1, 12, 334107) The latter was embarrassed at the sage seeking his forgiveness and said, King among sages, this shop is yours, satisfy your hunger as much as you wish. This made a deep impression on the sage.
('71', 160, 1, 13, 334300) He told the butcher that as from that day the latter was his guru.
('71', 160, 1, 14, 334367) There follows a long conversation between the two which is narrated in the Mahabharata.
('71', 160, 1, 15, 334455) However, it is irrelevant for your purpose.
('71', 160, 1, 16, 334499) I narrated this story to you so that you would get an idea of what religious life is like.
('71', 160, 1, 17, 334590) You have already taken a vow to keep your thoughts pure for twelve years and study while observing brahmacharya, but as from today you have begun thinking from the standpoint of dharma.
('71', 160, 1, 18, 334776) You should not make the mistakes you have been making in the past as you have a new birth now.
('71', 160, 1, 19, 334871) And, before you do anything you shall ask yourself whether what you are doing is right or wrong.
('71', 160, 1, 20, 334968) The sacred thread is useful from this standpoint.
('71', 160, 1, 21, 335018) Otherwise, there is no need to believe that dwija means a Brahmin.
('71', 160, 1, 22, 335085) A Brahmin is one who has awareness of Brahman.
('71', 160, 1, 23, 335132) If, after receiving the sacred thread, we do not take a new birth, if we do not begin a life in accordance with dharma, it makes little difference whether we wear it or not.
('71', 160, 1, 24, 335306) I do not ask anyone to wear the sacred thread, as it has become a mere outward ceremony.
('71', 160, 1, 25, 335395) But those who wish to imbibe consciousness of dharma from the ceremony may well wear the sacred thread.

('71', 162, 5, 19, 337507) LILA, Dwarkadas seems to have committed some mistake in the diet.
('71', 162, 5, 20, 337573) I would prefer that he should go to Rajkot.
('71', 162, 5, 21, 337617) But it would be equally good if he came to Wardha.
('71', 162, 5, 22, 337668) In any case it would be definitely good for him to leave Bombay.
('71', 162, 5, 23, 337733) Possibly he may not get at Wardha the facilities he will have at Rajkot.
('71', 162, 5, 24, 337806) Your bread was altogether ill baked.
('71', 162, 5, 25, 337843) Nobody could eat it.
('71', 162, 5, 26, 337864) Everybody had to throw it away.
('71', 162, 5, 27, 337896) You will learn in time by keeping on trying like this, but one should draw a lesson from every error.
('71', 162, 5, 28, 337998) A mango tree does not bear fruit in a short time.
('71', 162, 5, 29, 338048) Haste will not pay in learning cooking.
('71', 162, 5, 30, 338088) We shall reach on the 24th.
('71', 162, 5, 31, 338116) Here it has been raining all the time.

('71', 163, 3, 4, 338402) DEAR C. R., Personally I think it is better to ignore Rajahs letter.
('71', 163, 3, 5, 338471) But you may take notice of it, if you think it necessary in the public interest.

('71', 163, 7, 11, 338782) For today you may consider me the President.
('71', 163, 7, 12, 338827) For I shall have to do most of the talking particularly on the subject of Kishorelals 1
('71', 163, 8, 13, 338915) intended resignation.
('71', 163, 8, 14, 338937) He insists on resigning as President.
('71', 163, 8, 15, 338975) I do not like it.
('71', 163, 8, 16, 338993) I had no suspicion at all of his intention to resign.
('71', 163, 8, 17, 339047) There is something in it which is contrary to dharma.
('71', 163, 8, 18, 339101) He came to see me in the morning.
('71', 163, 8, 19, 339135) That is why I have been late by a few minutes.
('71', 163, 8, 20, 339182) In the course of our talk I asked him a few questions.
('71', 163, 8, 21, 339237) From his answers I could only conclude that what he intends to do is contrary to dharma.
('71', 163, 8, 22, 339326) It is impossible of course that Kishorelal should deliberately do anything which is contrary to dharma.
('71', 163, 8, 23, 339430) He is a godfearing man.
('71', 163, 8, 24, 339454) But even godfearing men sometimes do things, albeit unknowingly, which are contrary to dharma.
('71', 163, 8, 25, 339549) I say this from my own experience as well as that of others.
('71', 163, 8, 26, 339610) The intention always is to pursue dharma.
('71', 163, 8, 27, 339652) The effect is violation of it.
('71', 163, 8, 28, 339683) If Kishorelal persists in his intention to resign there is going to be a violation of dharma.
('71', 163, 8, 29, 339777) I can cite many instances of the kind, only I do not wish to take up your time.
('71', 163, 8, 30, 339857) I did not of course wish to press Kishorelal.
('71', 163, 8, 31, 339903) I did question him thoroughly.
('71', 163, 8, 32, 339934) From his own answers I could see that his resgination would bring no good either to

('71', 164, 1, 2, 340085) the Sangh or to him personally.
('71', 164, 1, 3, 340117) He himself is the best judge of his dharma.
('71', 164, 1, 4, 340161) I cannot presume to judge for him.
('71', 164, 1, 5, 340196) My duty is merely to help him in what he may consider his dharma.
('71', 164, 1, 6, 340262) I would have done so in such a situation.
('71', 164, 1, 7, 340304) But he was not able to say definitely that that was his dharma.
('71', 164, 1, 8, 340368) Gomati was with him.
('71', 164, 1, 9, 340389) I have respect for her intelligence.
('71', 164, 1, 10, 340426) I inquired from her.
('71', 164, 1, 11, 340447) She could not say much, except that Kishorelal had been distressed during the last two days.
('71', 164, 1, 12, 340540) In my opinion this was not a sufficient reason.
('71', 164, 1, 13, 340588) It would not justify my telling Kishorelal to do as he contemplated.
('71', 164, 1, 14, 340657) Then I sent for Nathji 1 .
('71', 164, 1, 15, 340684) He is very intimate with Kishorelal.
('71', 164, 1, 16, 340721) Kishorelal has great respect for him.
('71', 164, 1, 17, 340759) I knew that in case of doubt Kishorelal would seek his advice.
('71', 164, 1, 18, 340822) I also know him well.
('71', 164, 1, 19, 340844) I asked him.
('71', 164, 1, 20, 340857) I saw that he was inclined to agree with me.
('71', 164, 1, 21, 340902) He told me he would have a talk with Kishorelal.
('71', 164, 1, 22, 340951) I had no intention of making use of Nathjis influence with him.
('71', 164, 1, 23, 341015) If both Kishorelal and Gomati clearly felt that it was Kishorelals dharma to resign I would ask you to let him go.
('71', 164, 1, 24, 341130) But Nathji told me that he could not say anything in the matter and that I should order Kishorelal.
('71', 164, 1, 25, 341230) Well, generally I do not like to order even children.
('71', 164, 1, 26, 341284) But sometimes I order even old men.
('71', 164, 1, 27, 341320) I agreed to do so.
('71', 164, 1, 28, 341339) I told Kishorelal that he could not leave at this juncture.
('71', 164, 1, 29, 341399) It will not distress Kishorelal to obey because he is conscious of dharma.
('71', 164, 1, 30, 341474) He has agreed.
('71', 164, 1, 31, 341489) I have told you this because you must know.
('71', 164, 1, 32, 341533) It is now for you and for me to remove the doubt that assails him.
('71', 164, 1, 33, 341600) We are votaries of truth and non violence.
('71', 164, 1, 34, 341643) None of course can boast of fully pursuing truth and non violence.
('71', 164, 1, 35, 341710) To boast of any such thing would be conceit.
('71', 164, 1, 36, 341755) But while we may not boast we have a right to try.
('71', 164, 1, 37, 341806) Kishorelal fears we are giving up truth and non violence.
('71', 164, 1, 38, 341864) The parliamentary programme has created an enthusiasm amongst us.
('71', 164, 1, 39, 341930) We have come to feel that swaraj will be more quickly obtained through that programme.
('71', 164, 1, 40, 342017) Therefore the question of the means employed ceases to be considered.
('71', 164, 1, 41, 342087) The brute in man is awakened.
('71', 164, 1, 42, 342117) I concede that this possibility is there in our accepting the programme.
('71', 164, 1, 43, 342190) And it is of course agreed that there is a good deal of the brute in man.
('71', 164, 1, 44, 342264) Externally God has made us quite different from animalsfor instance, we have hands which animals do not have.
('71', 164, 1, 45, 342374) But the inner distinction is of much greater importance.
('71', 164, 1, 46, 342431) A sign of this inner distinction is mans ability to judge between the essential and the inessential.
('71', 164, 1, 47, 342532) The brute in us will show itself in any case.
('71', 164, 1, 48, 342578) May be, in the Councils programme there are greater chances for the brute to manifest itself.
('71', 164, 1, 49, 342672) But we have been born as men, which will be justified if we subdue the beast.
('71', 164, 1, 50, 342750) We have to

('71', 165, 0, 1, 342782) 166 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 165, 1, 2, 342824) bring out through our conduct the distinction between us and the animals.
('71', 165, 1, 3, 342898) In this lies our humanness.
('71', 165, 1, 4, 342926) It is not godliness.
('71', 165, 1, 5, 342947) I know the Councils programme is such that we may indulge in abusing the British.
('71', 165, 1, 6, 343029) We may deliver harsh worded speeches.
('71', 165, 1, 7, 343067) There is a lot of room for conceit, too.
('71', 165, 1, 8, 343108) We have to keep away from all this.
('71', 165, 1, 9, 343144) So we have to have a man who has an awareness of this.
('71', 165, 1, 10, 343199) That is why we made Kishorelal our President.
('71', 165, 1, 11, 343245) Gandhi Seva Sanghs work cannot be carried on with money.
('71', 165, 1, 12, 343302) If it could, we would have proposed Jamnalalji as our President and he would have agreed.
('71', 165, 1, 13, 343392) But he told us to look for a fitter person and withdrew.
('71', 165, 1, 14, 343449) If Jamnalalji collects a crore of rupees for the Sangh it will not benefit the Sangh, it will only harm it.
('71', 165, 1, 15, 343557) Kishorelaldoes not have a pice he can call his own.
('71', 165, 1, 16, 343609) He was considered fit to be the President.
('71', 165, 1, 17, 343652) Kishorelals argument is that the parliamentary programme is full of temptations.
('71', 165, 1, 18, 343733) But is that any reason why we should keep away from it?
('71', 165, 1, 19, 343789) Should we not face the temptations?
('71', 165, 1, 20, 343825) Kishorelal answers that so far we have remained untouched by temptations, that even today we look upon the things with suspicion.
('71', 165, 1, 21, 343955) Then there are a number of important things to do.
('71', 165, 1, 22, 344006) Under the circumstances, why should we unnecessarily take upon ourselves this botheration?
('71', 165, 1, 23, 344097) I say you are going at my instance.
('71', 165, 1, 24, 344133) The responsibility is mine.
('71', 165, 1, 25, 344161) So far we have not gone.
('71', 165, 1, 26, 344186) But can anyone say our hearts, too, were untouched?
('71', 165, 1, 27, 344238) From the point of view of truth and non violence, it can be dharma to accept something that we had earlier rejected.
('71', 165, 1, 28, 344355) Our dharma is not one sided.
('71', 165, 1, 29, 344384) So much for Kishorelals doubts.
('71', 165, 1, 30, 344416) Then he also says that the language of the resolutions of the Congress these days does not give expression to truth.
('71', 165, 1, 31, 344533) This charge, too, is one sided.
('71', 165, 1, 32, 344565) He who proposes a resolution expresses his thoughts.
('71', 165, 1, 33, 344618) The resolutions of the Congress also express the truth as the Congress sees it.
('71', 165, 1, 34, 344698) We smell untruth in them.
('71', 165, 1, 35, 344724) The resolution says that we are going into the Councils to wreck the Constitution.
('71', 165, 1, 36, 344807) How can we show consideration for what we intend to destroy?
('71', 165, 1, 37, 344868) Before 1920 the feeling was: why look towards a thing which we do not wish to accept?
('71', 165, 1, 38, 344954) Kishorelal feels that so far we had kept the flow of water blocked and that now we are breaking the dyke, which must release the water.
('71', 165, 1, 39, 345090) So long we had talked of boycotting Councils, schools, courts, etc., and of destroying them.
('71', 165, 1, 40, 345183) Today we are speaking a different language.
('71', 165, 1, 41, 345227) There are others also who share this feeling.
('71', 165, 1, 42, 345273) All this is being said with reference to the manifesto of the Congress.
('71', 165, 1, 43, 345345) How can we consider the language of the manifesto?
('71', 165, 1, 44, 345396) The manifesto is not that of Jawaharlal alone.
('71', 165, 1, 45, 345443) Vallabhbhai, Rajendra Babu and I have our share in it.
('71', 165, 1, 46, 345498) I have not forgotten it.
('71', 165, 1, 47, 345523) I read it over two or three times.
('71', 165, 1, 48, 345558) It is not contradicted by the Congress resolution concerning acceptance
('71', 166, 0, 1, 345630) VOL.71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 167
('71', 166, 1, 2, 345673) of office.
('71', 166, 1, 3, 345684) The practical part of that resolution has been drafted by me.
('71', 166, 1, 4, 345746) Jawaharlal thought that it was not in conformity with the remaining three fourths of the resolution and with the manifesto.
('71', 166, 1, 5, 345870) He interprets the manifesto in one way, I in another.
('71', 166, 1, 6, 345924) I see nothing wrong in it.
('71', 166, 1, 7, 345951) The language is open to two different interpretations; of this there is no doubt.
('71', 166, 1, 8, 346033) But a satyagrahi can use language which may be interpreted in two different ways.
('71', 166, 1, 9, 346115) Truth, as I know it, does not demand that the words a satyagrahi utters should have only one meaning.
('71', 166, 1, 10, 346217) What he says may have not two but several different meanings.
('71', 166, 1, 11, 346279) The condition merely is that the meaning should not be hidden, words should not be used for deception and should be necessary [to convey the meaning].
('71', 166, 1, 12, 346430) The intention in using the language should not be to hide truth.
('71', 166, 1, 13, 346495) When we frankly speak a language admitting two interpretations, we are not giving up truth.
('71', 166, 1, 14, 346587) Sometimes it also happens that we intend only one meaning but those who hear us read two meanings in what we say.
('71', 166, 1, 15, 346701) Here also truth is not violated.
('71', 166, 1, 16, 346734) An outstanding instance is the Vedas.
('71', 166, 1, 17, 346772) The Gita also has two meanings: one spiritual, the other material.
('71', 166, 1, 18, 346839) There are also various other meanings.
('71', 166, 1, 19, 346878) We cannot say the language of Tulsidas has only one meaning.
('71', 166, 1, 20, 346939) So many meanings are read in his language that poor Tulsidas would never have imagined.
('71', 166, 1, 21, 347027) But this does not prove either the authors or their commentators false.
('71', 166, 1, 22, 347099) The language of the servant of truth does not always yield only one meaning.
('71', 166, 1, 23, 347176) There is nothing to fear if in the same resolution Jawaharlal reads one meaning and I another.
('71', 166, 1, 24, 347271) I have told him that his own interpretation may not necessarily be true.
('71', 166, 1, 25, 347344) I had a discussion with him on the subject of office acceptance.
('71', 166, 1, 26, 347409) The resolution was an independent document.
('71', 166, 1, 27, 347453) Jawaharlals contention was that it was not in conformity with the background of the manifesto 1. I told him that if he so desired I could make it conform to it.
('71', 166, 1, 28, 347614) For when I say that I shall wreck the Constitution I mean I shall wreck it through non violence.
('71', 166, 1, 29, 347711) Please remember this condition of mine.
('71', 166, 1, 30, 347751) I can bring about freedom by remaining inside it.
('71', 166, 1, 31, 347801) If we have courage and independence of spirit, we can wreck the Constitution through non violence.
('71', 166, 1, 32, 347900) Jawaharlal does not think it is possible though he would of course be happy if this could be done.
('71', 166, 1, 33, 347999) He mistrusts the human race a little.
('71', 166, 1, 34, 348037) He says we would not be able to do anything there.
('71', 166, 1, 35, 348088) He therefore places his faith in class struggle.
('71', 166, 1, 36, 348137) This is the fundamental difference between him and me.
('71', 166, 1, 37, 348192) I say capital is insentient but the capitalist is not so.
('71', 166, 1, 38, 348250) It is possible

('71', 167, 1, 2, 348381) to change his heart.
('71', 167, 1, 3, 348402) He says this has never happened before.
('71', 167, 1, 4, 348442) He quotes instances from history in support of his contention.
('71', 167, 1, 5, 348505) I hear what he says.
('71', 167, 1, 6, 348526) But my contention is, if it is not possible through non violence to do what has not been done so far, which is the other power with which it can be done?
('71', 167, 1, 7, 348680) If it cannot be done, then non violence loses all significance.
('71', 167, 1, 8, 348744) Never till I die can I accept thisprovided of course I retain my ideas till I die.
('71', 167, 1, 9, 348827) Today it is my firm conviction that non violence will triumph.
('71', 167, 1, 10, 348890) Even if we are all defeated non violence will still triumph.
('71', 167, 1, 11, 348951) I shall continue to say it until my last moment.
('71', 167, 1, 12, 349000) Personally I would want to change the heart of the Government also.
('71', 167, 1, 13, 349068) That is why we are going into the Councils.
('71', 167, 1, 14, 349112) If I accept office it will be to gain swaraj.
('71', 167, 1, 15, 349158) If we cannot secure office no harm will be done.
('71', 167, 1, 16, 349207) I loose nothing.
('71', 167, 1, 17, 349224) In either case I win.
('71', 167, 1, 18, 349246) He who considers it improper to accept office with a view to wrecking the Constitution will naturally not accept office.
('71', 167, 1, 19, 349367) But if we come pledging ourselves to truth, non violence, fearlessness and unselfishness and accept Ministerships on our own conditions, we can win the battle of swaraj and establish a constitution of our own making in place of the present one.
('71', 167, 1, 20, 349612) Jawaharlal does not think so.
('71', 167, 1, 21, 349642) There is no point in hiding the fact that he holds opinions which are different from mine.
('71', 167, 1, 22, 349733) Obviously Rajendra Babu, Vallabhbhai, Rajaji and others are inclined in one way, Jawaharlal in another.
('71', 167, 1, 23, 349837) Nevertheless we are all working together.
('71', 167, 1, 24, 349879) It is certainly a matter of wonder.
('71', 167, 1, 25, 349915) But it is a necessity.
('71', 167, 1, 26, 349938) After all we have to live in the world.
('71', 167, 1, 27, 349978) We have to work with patriots holding views different from our own.
('71', 167, 1, 28, 350046) Therefore we have to work in a spirit of co operation and compromise.
('71', 167, 1, 29, 350116) For this we shall have to take the initiative.
('71', 167, 1, 30, 350163) There is no doubt that Jawaharlal is inclined to be rash.
('71', 167, 1, 31, 350221) He says harsh things.
('71', 167, 1, 32, 350243) Sometimes he calls people names.
('71', 167, 1, 33, 350276) But he knows the worth of his colleagues.
('71', 167, 1, 34, 350318) He understands discipline and restraint.
('71', 167, 1, 35, 350359) Jawaharlal works with his colleagues in the belief that one day he will convert them to his view and he hopes that his contact with them will one day change their opinions.
('71', 167, 1, 36, 350532) Three ideologies have thus been in conflict in the Congress.
('71', 167, 1, 37, 350593) Even when I was in the Working Committee there was this conflict between two or three ideologies.
('71', 167, 1, 38, 350691) I purposely made Vithalbhai the secretary.
('71', 167, 1, 39, 350734) Even so the drafting of the resolutions always had to be done by me.
('71', 167, 1, 40, 350803) They always admitted of two interpretations.
('71', 167, 1, 41, 350848) I saw no objection to this because I have to carry the others with me.
('71', 167, 1, 42, 350919) Truth and non violence are the creed of the Congress.
('71', 167, 1, 43, 350973) Still no one has accepted them as their creed.
('71', 167, 1, 44, 351020) Those who have accepted them as a creed belong to this Sangh.
('71', 167, 1, 45, 351082) Having admitted that we have so far pursued truth and non violence, Kishorelal asks, supposing we adopt policies in future which would mean giving up of truth and non violence in practice, then?
('71', 167, 1, 46, 351277) I say to him, In that case
('71', 168, 0, 1, 351304) VOL.71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 169
('71', 168, 1, 2, 351347) your leaving the Sangh will not help.
('71', 168, 1, 3, 351385) In that case you will have to wind up the Sangh, you will have to bury it.
('71', 168, 1, 4, 351460) You must then say that neither you nor anyone else can run the Sangh. He asks me, Who is he to say this. I tell him that it is his right.
('71', 168, 1, 5, 351598) He is the chief of the Sangh.
('71', 168, 1, 6, 351628) It is therefore also his duty.
('71', 168, 1, 7, 351659) If the members of the Sangh practise untruth and violence, he will then have to say that it should be wound up.
('71', 168, 1, 8, 351771) Others may persist in continuing the Sangh.
('71', 168, 1, 9, 351815) But in that case it will have ceased to be a body wedded to truth and non violence.
('71', 168, 1, 10, 351899) I do not say this without deliberation.
('71', 168, 1, 11, 351939) I have thought a good deal over the matter.
('71', 168, 1, 12, 351983) I have ordered Kishorelal to continue at his post.
('71', 168, 1, 13, 352034) He has agreed to stay and he is non sorry for it.
('71', 168, 1, 14, 352084) This tale now ends here.
('71', 168, 1, 15, 352109) Let me now explain the policy we have adopted on the Councils question.
('71', 168, 1, 16, 352181) The resolution does not mean that all of you are now free to go to the Councils.
('71', 168, 1, 17, 352262) We have only one programmethe constructive programme.
('71', 168, 1, 18, 352316) Swaraj depends only upon this.
('71', 168, 1, 19, 352347) You have to devote yourself only to this.
('71', 168, 1, 20, 352389) I do not even dream, no one ever does, that we can secure swaraj through Legislative Assemblies.
('71', 168, 1, 21, 352486) But if we can promote the constructive programme even with the help of Legislative Assemblies, why should we not do so?
('71', 168, 1, 22, 352606) We shall certainly further the constructive programme through these bodies.
('71', 168, 1, 23, 352682) We shall also work outside.
('71', 168, 1, 24, 352710) Then we shall certainly secure swaraj.
('71', 168, 1, 25, 352749) Jawaharlal believes that we can fight the Government there.
('71', 168, 1, 26, 352809) Fight we certainly can and fight we may.
('71', 168, 1, 27, 352850) But we shall not sacrifice truth and non violence even one whit.
('71', 168, 1, 28, 352915) We have to prepare for civil disobedience.
('71', 168, 1, 29, 352958) Jawaharlal also says that we have to prepare for civil disobedience.
('71', 168, 1, 30, 353027) But he does not consider non violence the only means.
('71', 168, 1, 31, 353081) To him non violence is not the supreme dharma.
('71', 168, 1, 32, 353128) If for the sake of the freedom of India he feels compelled to cut the throats of Englishmen, he will not hesitate.
('71', 168, 1, 33, 353243) But he will do it openly, not in a clandestine manner.
('71', 168, 1, 34, 353298) This is not my policy.
('71', 168, 1, 35, 353321) I have given the sovereign place to non violence.
('71', 168, 1, 36, 353371) Swaraj coming through violence will be no swaraj for me.
('71', 168, 1, 37, 353428) I shall therefore never agree to it.You also share my view.
('71', 168, 1, 38, 353488) To Jawaharlal violence may well not be dispensable, but if swaraj could be gained through non violence he would be happy.
('71', 168, 1, 39, 353610) He, therefore, co operates with me in my experiments.
('71', 168, 1, 40, 353664) We are adopting a new policy.
('71', 168, 1, 41, 353694) We are going into the Councils to strengthen the old policy.
('71', 168, 1, 42, 353755) We are there to break the walls.
('71', 168, 1, 43, 353788) What will happen if, in the name of the three crores of voters, other people go into the Councils and say that they do not want the charkha?
('71', 168, 1, 44, 353929) I say that you have to go to Councils to further the cause of the charkha.
('71', 168, 1, 45, 354004) You go there as the representatives of the people.
('71', 168, 1, 46, 354055) You will say that the charkha had been going on even before.
('71', 169, 0, 1, 354116) 170 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 169, 1, 2, 354158) It is true, but it has been going on without thought.
('71', 169, 1, 3, 354212) If we had plied the charkha knowing its implications, we should have secured swaraj by now, and it would not have been necessary for us to go to the Councils.
('71', 169, 1, 4, 354371) Let us ply the charkha with knowledge.
('71', 169, 1, 5, 354410) I again affirm what I had said in 1920 that if we ply the charkha with knowledge, swaraj is in our hands.
('71', 169, 1, 6, 354516) You will say that I make statements which have no meanings.
('71', 169, 1, 7, 354576) I do say things which have many meanings.
('71', 169, 1, 8, 354618) Here, too, the charkha has to be given a wide interpretation.
('71', 169, 1, 9, 354680) I still say that if the whole country plies the charkha with deliberation we shall not have so much as to mention the Councils.
('71', 169, 1, 10, 354808) Today that is not so.
('71', 169, 1, 11, 354830) Today we must come into close contact with the representatives of the three crores of voters.
('71', 169, 1, 12, 354924) We must take from them as much as we can.
('71', 169, 1, 13, 354966) Why should we not ?
('71', 169, 1, 14, 354986) It does not mean that all of us should go to the Councils or that all those who wish to go should be permitted to do so.
('71', 169, 1, 15, 355107) We shall inquire fully into the merits of each case.
('71', 169, 1, 16, 355160) We shall also need a parlimentary committee.
('71', 169, 1, 17, 355205) It must have both Rajendra Babu and Vallabhbhai on it.
('71', 169, 1, 18, 355260) This means that we are not opening the doors of the Legislatures for all the members of the Sangh.
('71', 169, 1, 19, 355359) Nor are we opening the doors of the Sangh.
('71', 169, 1, 20, 355402) We are opening the doors of the Legislatures only for those who have pledged themselves to the constructive programme and without whom the Congress risks loosing seats.
('71', 169, 1, 21, 355571) Let us leave Kishorelal to decide the matter.
('71', 169, 1, 22, 355617) No one else can decide this.
('71', 169, 1, 23, 355646) If tomorrow Satyamurti asks me if I would admit him into the Sangh, I shall say no.
('71', 169, 1, 24, 355730) .My relations with Satyamurti are excellent.
('71', 169, 1, 25, 355775) Sometimes out of consideration for me he lets his daughter ply a charkha.
('71', 169, 1, 26, 355849) But he does not believe in the charkha and he cannot be a member of the Sangh, however much help he may render us.
('71', 169, 1, 27, 355964) This is by way of an instance.
('71', 169, 1, 28, 355995) This shows that we have not opened our doors to everyone.
('71', 169, 1, 29, 356053) We have opened the doors for our own people.
('71', 169, 1, 30, 356098) Supposing we want that Jethalal should not go, shall we give up the Anantpur seat?
('71', 169, 1, 31, 356181) If Dr. Khare says that he has to be sent, I may say that he is an uncouth person, that he does not know anything beyond the charkha, cannot even speak properly.
('71', 169, 1, 32, 356342) But if nevertheless Dr. Khare insists on Jethalal being sent, I shall say to Jethalal: Please go and ply your charkha there.
('71', 169, 1, 33, 356467) At least one votary of Charkha was found necessary there.
('71', 169, 1, 34, 356525) I am glad of it.
('71', 169, 1, 35, 356542) If everyone going there believes in the charkha, the effectiveness of the charkha will increase. Let us therefore try and see that everyone going there should be a votary of the charkha.
('71', 169, 1, 36, 356729) But we must not appease the people.
('71', 169, 1, 37, 356765) We must not flatter them.
('71', 169, 1, 38, 356791) Such people have gone.
('71', 169, 1, 39, 356814) Sardar tells me that if Dr. Gopichand had not gone, we would have lost the seat.
('71', 169, 1, 40, 356895) There have been several such people.
('71', 169, 1, 41, 356932) If it has not been the case everywhere it is a
('71', 170, 0, 1, 356979) VOL.71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 171
('71', 170, 1, 2, 357022) matter of shame.
('71', 170, 1, 3, 357039) If everywhere we can send representatives of the charkha and the villagers, we should do so.
('71', 170, 1, 4, 357132) You will become really capable when you develop for your work a thousand times the love that you feel for it today.
('71', 170, 1, 5, 357248) Then you will not go on your own but under popular pressure.
('71', 170, 1, 6, 357309) If you have a socialist rival he will withdraw in your favour.
('71', 170, 1, 7, 357372) Only then is there any point in your going.
('71', 170, 1, 8, 357416) If the socialist has a chance of going and he does not see any need for you to go, you should let him.
('71', 170, 1, 9, 357519) I do not wish to cause mutual quarrels.
('71', 170, 1, 10, 357559) I am one who left the Congress in order to avoid quarrels.
('71', 170, 1, 11, 357618) When I was in the Congress I said I wanted Kelkar.
('71', 170, 1, 12, 357669) I had sufficient faith in my own skill to feel that he would do the least harm if he worked with me.
('71', 170, 1, 13, 357770) I want that it should be made impossible for anyone else to go except those who have faith in the charkha.
('71', 170, 1, 14, 357877) If Vallabhbhai gives up the charkha, he will no longer remain the Sardar of Gujarat.
('71', 170, 1, 15, 357962) And if in that case he fights the election on his own and wins, it would be a matter of shame for the Sangh, it would be a matter of shame for Bardoli, a matter of shame for Gujarat.
('71', 170, 1, 16, 358145) It would also be a matter of shame for us.
('71', 170, 1, 17, 358188) Whom then shall we send?
('71', 170, 1, 18, 358213) One is told that the charkhawalas have no intellect.
('71', 170, 1, 19, 358266) This is true to some extent.
('71', 170, 1, 20, 358295) If we ply the charkha like automatons, it is no discipline.
('71', 170, 1, 21, 358355) There is the story of Ekalavya in the Mahabharata.
('71', 170, 1, 22, 358406) Think over it.
('71', 170, 1, 23, 358421) It is not mere poetry.
('71', 170, 1, 24, 358444) There is truth in it.
('71', 170, 1, 25, 358466) Clay is not sentient and an image has no strength, but for Ekalavya, the image of Dronacharya was not clay.
('71', 170, 1, 26, 358574) He saw in it Guru Dronacharya himself.
('71', 170, 1, 27, 358613) How could his indomitable faith fail?
('71', 170, 1, 28, 358651) If we have such a faith in the charkha, it can become for us a living image.
('71', 170, 1, 29, 358728) We can then put into it all our resolve.
('71', 170, 1, 30, 358769) The charkha is for us a symbol of ahimsa.
('71', 170, 1, 31, 358811) The real thing here is not the image, but our attitude towards it.
('71', 170, 1, 32, 358878) In one sense the world is real, in another God alone is the one thing real.
('71', 170, 1, 33, 358954) Both are true in different ways.
('71', 170, 1, 34, 358987) If we can see God in our symbol it represents truth for us.
('71', 170, 1, 35, 359047) Non violence is not for fools.
('71', 170, 1, 36, 359078) We will have to use our intelligence.
('71', 170, 1, 37, 359116) Non violence has place both for knowledge and action, that is, both forthe intellect and the organs of the body.
('71', 170, 1, 38, 359229) Today these are used for the destruction of non violence.
('71', 170, 1, 39, 359287) What we want is that these should become hand maidens of non violence.
('71', 170, 1, 40, 359358) Only when we make the organs of our body hand maidens of non violence will they acquire strength.
('71', 170, 1, 41, 359456) If non violence cannot be effective in this field, where else can it be so?
('71', 170, 1, 42, 359532) I shall not leave any field out of fear.
('71', 170, 1, 43, 359573) If I leave any field fearing that non violence will be of no use, then there can be no such thing as non violence.
('71', 170, 1, 44, 359688) And what field shall I give up?
('71', 170, 1, 45, 359720) My body will continue to function, the organs of the body will continue to be active.
('71', 170, 1, 46, 359806) I do not
('71', 171, 0, 1, 359815) 172 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 171, 1, 2, 359857) wish to commit suicide.
('71', 171, 1, 3, 359881) I shall not block my ears and my nose.
('71', 171, 1, 4, 359920) What then shall I do?
('71', 171, 1, 5, 359942) There is only one way open to me and that is to make all the limbs of my body hand maidens of non violence.
('71', 171, 1, 6, 360050) The other method was tried by Kishorelal.
('71', 171, 1, 7, 360092) That was many years ago.
('71', 171, 1, 8, 360117) He went into solitude to discipline himself.
('71', 171, 1, 9, 360162) When a train whistled past, it broke his solitude.
('71', 171, 1, 10, 360213) One day when I went to him on my usual visit, he told me that the whistling of the train troubled him and that he was thinking of plugging his ears with cottonwool or rubber.
('71', 171, 1, 11, 360388) I told him to try that method also.
('71', 171, 1, 12, 360424) But it was only an external aid.
('71', 171, 1, 13, 360457) He was not able to concentrate on God, so he heard the sound of the whistle.
('71', 171, 1, 14, 360534) Kishorelal himself saw this and so when the next day I told him to put cottonwool or rubber into his ears he said that that was no longer necessary.
('71', 171, 1, 15, 360683) We have ears but they are not for misuse.
('71', 171, 1, 16, 360725) The same is true of the other organs.
('71', 171, 1, 17, 360763) The organs are there to sustain the body.
('71', 171, 1, 18, 360805) Our mouth eats to nourish the body.
('71', 171, 1, 19, 360841) If we eat for the pleasure of the palate we shall not be pursuing non violence.
('71', 171, 1, 20, 360921) Even if someone forcibly sends us to the Councils we shall have our own views.
('71', 171, 1, 21, 361000) Kishorelal fears once we go there we shall forget all our ideas.
('71', 171, 1, 22, 361065) I share his fear.
('71', 171, 1, 23, 361083) But why should I shirk because of it?
('71', 171, 1, 24, 361121) If you do not have a living faith in the charkha and the rest of the constructive programme of the Congress, the fears of Kishorelal will prove true.
('71', 171, 1, 25, 361271) But I have faith in you.
('71', 171, 1, 26, 361296) If I did not have it, I would not have come here.
('71', 171, 1, 27, 361346) Why should I distrust you?
('71', 171, 1, 28, 361373) I have frankly told you everything.
('71', 171, 1, 29, 361409) There is here no departure from policy.
('71', 171, 1, 30, 361449) Last evening the language used was different but that is the way with language.
('71', 171, 1, 31, 361529) Language acquires lucidity in the course of work.
('71', 171, 1, 32, 361579) There is no doubt that harmony of thought, word and deed is the sign of truth.
('71', 171, 1, 33, 361658) But ideas advance and language is left behind.
('71', 171, 1, 34, 361705) I wondered why I was not able to convince Kishorelal.
('71', 171, 1, 35, 361759) My language was vague.
('71', 171, 1, 36, 361782) I listened to the discussion and my ideas became clear.
('71', 171, 1, 37, 361838) But the language did not become clear.
('71', 171, 1, 38, 361877) When I meditate after giving thought to a matter my language becomes clearer and clearer each day.
('71', 171, 1, 39, 361976) But I have not yet had time for this.
('71', 171, 1, 40, 362014) In accepting the Councils programme we are not getting away from non violence.
('71', 171, 1, 41, 362093) In taking this step, I am making you advance two steps in the direction of non violence.
('71', 171, 1, 42, 362182) If you can understand them and act accordingly you shall during this year make progress such as you have never been able to make before.
('71', 171, 1, 43, 362319) The time has come when India must choose either this way or that.
('71', 171, 1, 44, 362385) It seems to me that at this juncture you cannot keep yourselves shut up in a room.
('71', 171, 1, 45, 362468) It is yet to be shown whether as a nation we are moving towards truth and non violence or not.
('71', 171, 1, 46, 362563) It would be cowardice for you to turn away from three crores of voters.
('71', 171, 1, 47, 362635) Even if we have truth and non violence on our
('71', 172, 0, 1, 362681) VOL.71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 173
('71', 172, 1, 2, 362724) tongues and something else in our hearts, what I have said will bear fruit.
('71', 172, 1, 3, 362800) If you are not hypocrites you will go to the Assemblies with full faith in non violence and advance towards the goal.
('71', 172, 1, 4, 362918) If you prove to be hypocrites it will not distress me.
('71', 172, 1, 5, 362973) It would do us good if hypocrisy is exposed.
('71', 172, 1, 6, 363018) When life leaves the body we burn it, even though it be that of a person as dear as a father, and we cast the ashes in the Ganga.
('71', 172, 1, 7, 363148) If the soul of the Sangh, which is truth and non violence, leaves it, it will be the duty of Kishorelal to consign it to the flames.
('71', 172, 1, 8, 363281) The Sangh will get vigour only if it is a living thing.
('71', 172, 1, 9, 363337) If even today it has no life in it we are all hypocrites and it will be no use for the Sangh to continue to exist.
('71', 172, 1, 10, 363452) Shastris tell me that truth and non violence are subtle things.
('71', 172, 1, 11, 363516) They ask how one can form organizations out of abstract things.
('71', 172, 1, 12, 363580) I assert that truth and non violence can be organized.
('71', 172, 1, 13, 363635) If non violence cannot be organized, it is not a dharma.
('71', 172, 1, 14, 363692) If there is anything special about me, it is only this, that I am organizing truth and non violence.
('71', 172, 1, 15, 363793) Otherwise they will cease to be the eternal verities that they are to me.
('71', 172, 1, 16, 363867) To me truth and non violence are not unreal things and if they cannot become our collective dharma they are false.
('71', 172, 1, 17, 363982) What I want to do and want to die after doing, is to organize non violence.
('71', 172, 1, 18, 364058) And if it is not valid in every field it is false.
('71', 172, 1, 19, 364109) I assert that in every walk of life, non violence has its use.
('71', 172, 1, 20, 364172) I speak the language of the Jains.
('71', 172, 1, 21, 364207) They say that the rule should admit of no exception.
('71', 172, 1, 22, 364260) This is also the language of geometry.
('71', 172, 1, 23, 364299) A right angle must have 90 degrees.
('71', 172, 1, 24, 364335) If there is any sphere of life in which non violence is ineffective it is false.
('71', 172, 1, 25, 364416) Please remember this.
('71', 172, 1, 26, 364438) If you all take the opposite path and give up the charkha and non violence, I will say that you never had faith in truth and non vilence.
('71', 172, 1, 27, 364576) Believe it that though it may be without your knowing it, you were all votaries of violence., I do not condemn you.
('71', 172, 1, 28, 364692) You have come to the Sangh after careful thought and in the name of truth.Remember that truth and non violence are not for hermits.
('71', 172, 1, 29, 364824) These eternal principles apply in courts, legislatures and other spheres of human endeavour.
('71', 172, 1, 30, 364917) Your faith is going to be put to a severe test.
('71', 172, 1, 31, 364965) Do not run away in fright.
('71', 172, 1, 32, 364992) You are being given today a difficult question paper.
('71', 172, 1, 33, 365046) Neither you nor I know whether you will pass or not.
('71', 172, 1, 34, 365099) Even so, why should I fear ?
('71', 172, 1, 35, 365128) I do not want to render you impotent and stupid.
('71', 172, 1, 36, 365177) Truth and non violence are not for the stupid.
('71', 172, 1, 37, 365224) Why cannot Kanti, Bal, Tansukh 1
('71', 172, 2, 38, 365257) and others develop their minds by plying the charkha?
('71', 172, 2, 39, 365311) Why do they have to go the the college ?
('71', 172, 2, 40, 365352) If those of us who ply the charkha cannot show the intelligence that Kanti, Bal and Tansukh do, I shall say that
('71', 172, 3, 41, 365465) 1 Tansukh Bhatt
('71', 173, 0, 1, 365481) 174 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 173, 1, 2, 365523) we should also go to colleges.
('71', 173, 1, 3, 365554) But in truth in Kanti and others there has not been a development of the intellect, only a play of intellect.
('71', 173, 1, 4, 365664) The inquiry into our pursuit of truth and non violence makes for development of the intellect.
('71', 173, 1, 5, 365759) If they do not, then either they or we are false.
('71', 173, 1, 6, 365809) Since it is impossible for truth and non violence to be false, we ourselves are proved to be false.
('71', 173, 1, 7, 365909) The whole of the constructive programme is a reasearch into us.
('71', 173, 1, 8, 365973) I continue to ply the charkha.
('71', 173, 1, 9, 366004) I am now 69 years of age.
('71', 173, 1, 10, 366030) Therefore it cannot be said that my intellect is not developing.
('71', 173, 1, 11, 366095) What I am saying, I say deliberately and in full command of myself.
('71', 173, 1, 12, 366163) Bal, Kanti and Tansukh are not developing their intellects by going to colleges.
('71', 173, 1, 13, 366244) You may say that even those who work do not develop their intellects.
('71', 173, 1, 14, 366314) The reason is that they work like automatons.
('71', 173, 1, 15, 366360) My intellect will continue to develop till the moment I die.
('71', 173, 1, 16, 366421) The charkha is also the prop for my intellect but it does not stray into wrong paths.
('71', 173, 1, 17, 366507) I have no time to see, hear or read pleasurable things.
('71', 173, 1, 18, 366563) I discover Daridranarayana through the charkha and have vision of God.
('71', 173, 1, 19, 366634) This is the way my intellect has been developing and will continue to develop all my life.
('71', 173, 1, 20, 366725) The testing of a man is not complete till he dies.
('71', 173, 1, 21, 366776) If at the moment of death a mans intellect does not retain its brilliance I will say that he has not succeeded.
('71', 173, 1, 22, 366888) There is no rule that the intellect of those who ply the charkha cannot shine.
('71', 173, 1, 23, 366967) Only you should do it intelligently.
('71', 173, 1, 24, 367004) If you work as a carpenter, you must develop the science of carpentry.
('71', 173, 1, 25, 367075) Today I am formulating some stiff questions for the science of the charkha.
('71', 173, 1, 26, 367151) Because it absorbs all my faculties when I am immersed in the charkha I am in a state of bliss.
('71', 173, 1, 27, 367247) I am not yet able to say where the limits of the constructive programme lie.
('71', 173, 1, 28, 367324) The instance of the clay image shows only this.
('71', 173, 1, 29, 367372) In the constructive programme we have all round development.
('71', 173, 1, 30, 367433) The charkha is a mantra.
('71', 173, 1, 31, 367458) When I see those who ply the charkha discouraged, I am baffled.
('71', 173, 1, 32, 367522) Why is it that they are lacking in spiritual development?
('71', 173, 1, 33, 367580) What I am telling you concerns eternal truth, because I am able to experience it.
('71', 173, 1, 34, 367662) If I have gone to settle in Segaon it is not because I feel frustrated.
('71', 173, 1, 35, 367734) When the call comes I will even say that I shall not budge from Segaon.
('71', 173, 1, 36, 367806) I do not work there like a machine.
('71', 173, 1, 37, 367842) Truth and non violence develop the body, the intellect and the spirit.
('71', 173, 1, 38, 367913) If there is not all round development of all our faculties through truth and non violence we are hypocrites.
('71', 173, 1, 39, 368022) What service I have rendered ever since 1920 has been only through the charkha, though Hindu Muslim unity and through the campaign for eradication of untouchability.
('71', 173, 1, 40, 368188) I have always said that these reflect truth and non violence.
('71', 173, 1, 41, 368250) These were the shortest path to their discovery.
('71', 174, 0, 1, 368299) VOL.71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 175
('71', 174, 1, 2, 368342) Going into Legislatures is also a means towards approaching truth and non violence.
('71', 174, 1, 3, 368426) Otherwise Parliament for us is taboo.
('71', 174, 1, 4, 368464) That can be the only reason and there is no other for any interest we may have in the Councils programme.
('71', 174, 1, 5, 368570) Truth and non violence are ends as well as means.
('71', 174, 1, 6, 368620) If good and truthful men go into the Legislatures, those institutions can also become an effective means to furthering truth and non violence.
('71', 174, 1, 7, 368763) If this does not happen the failure will be ours and not theirs.
('71', 174, 1, 8, 368828) It will only mean that our intellects have not developed.
('71', 174, 1, 9, 368886) So much for the Councils programme.
('71', 174, 1, 10, 368922) Now I take Balubhais question.
('71', 174, 1, 11, 368953) The substance of the questions is whether we should go to the villages to serve or for political awakening.
('71', 174, 1, 12, 369061) I find it somewhat strange that after seventeen years of effort in furtherance of this programme such a question should be asked.
('71', 174, 1, 13, 369191) To me there is no political education apart from the constructive programme.
('71', 174, 1, 14, 369268) Our aim is merely the propagation of the charkha and such other things.
('71', 174, 1, 15, 369340) This does not mean that we do not wish to give the villagers political education.
('71', 174, 1, 16, 369422) But there is no such thing as political education by itself.
('71', 174, 1, 17, 369483) We should keep in touch with them without harbouring any motive.
('71', 174, 1, 18, 369548) We have to develop their strength.
('71', 174, 1, 19, 369583) I go to them with the programme of eradication of untouchability and the like and give them education.
('71', 174, 1, 20, 369686) Political education is just that.
('71', 174, 1, 21, 369720) If I do something apart from this and go the the villagers seeking votes, I shall be doing exactly what we blame the missionaries for doing.
('71', 174, 1, 22, 369861) I shall never talk to them about what is to my interest even if it should be intimately connected with the politics of the country.
('71', 174, 1, 23, 369993) Constructive programme is thus in itself a political education.
('71', 174, 1, 24, 370057) This is what I did in South Africa.
('71', 174, 1, 25, 370093) There also the question before me was not of numbers.
('71', 174, 1, 26, 370147) I never talked to the so called coolies about politics.
('71', 174, 1, 27, 370203) I did not organize them from any political motive.
('71', 174, 1, 28, 370254) The question of the  3 tax came later.
('71', 174, 1, 29, 370293) The organization came in useful for the satyagraha battle later.
('71', 174, 1, 30, 370358) During that battle I saw God face to face many times, so many times that even if I were a dunce I should not forget it.
('71', 174, 1, 31, 370478) I had not hoped that the organization I was building would bring such large results.
('71', 174, 1, 32, 370563) This is the way I conducted political education in South Africa.
('71', 174, 1, 33, 370628) It was not the whole of South Africa, only the Transvaal.
('71', 174, 1, 34, 370686) What I want to show is that the way I carried on the work of political education was by rendering silent, selfless service.
('71', 174, 1, 35, 370810) The people among whom I worked came of their own accord and began to shout Long live the Congress.
('71', 174, 1, 36, 370909) If the prestige that the South African Indian Congress today enjoys is not the result of political education, what else can it be?
('71', 174, 1, 37, 371040) Hertzog is saying the same thing today.
('71', 174, 1, 38, 371080) I continued this policy on my return to India from South
('71', 175, 0, 1, 371137) 176 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 175, 1, 2, 371179) Africa.
('71', 175, 1, 3, 371187) I worked in the Kheda district but did not so much as mention the Congress.
('71', 175, 1, 4, 371263) I talked solely of land revenue.
('71', 175, 1, 5, 371296) I worked among the labourers and did not mention the Congress.
('71', 175, 1, 6, 371359) In Champaran again I did not work in the name of the Congress.
('71', 175, 1, 7, 371422) My colleagues and I belonged to the Congress and that was enough, but when you go to Champaran today what do you see?
('71', 175, 1, 8, 371540) Is the Congress anywhere else as strong today as it is in Champaran?
('71', 175, 1, 9, 371609) On the strength of Champaran, Rajendra Babu rules Bihar today.
('71', 175, 1, 10, 371672) But even today I would not talk about the Congress there.
('71', 175, 1, 11, 371730) Knowledge is to be given where there is curiosity.
('71', 175, 1, 12, 371781) Today they do not even have bread.
('71', 175, 1, 13, 371816) What shall I gain by talking to them of things outside Champaran?
('71', 175, 1, 14, 371882) What shall I gain by teaching them geography, or history, or politics?
('71', 175, 1, 15, 371953) What shall I gain by talking to them about the problems of the whole country?
('71', 175, 1, 16, 372031) Considering all things, I have come to the conclusion that we cannot give political education by trying to give such education.
('71', 175, 1, 17, 372159) I have showed you through various instances what may be called real political education.
('71', 175, 1, 18, 372248) Political education is not something apart.
('71', 175, 1, 19, 372292) In 1920 I made boycott an essential part of the political programme.
('71', 175, 1, 20, 372361) I said: Forget parliament, forget law courts, forget even educational instituutions. People started saying that this man who has undertaken such terrible work is quite ridiculous.
('71', 175, 1, 21, 372541) In 1920 I made the charkha the centre of politics.
('71', 175, 1, 22, 372592) I made it a weapon for a battle.
('71', 175, 1, 23, 372625) In Bardoli also it was made an essential part of civil disobedience.
('71', 175, 1, 24, 372694) That is why the condition was laid down that the whole of Bardoli should adopt khadi inside of six months.
('71', 175, 1, 25, 372801) This was the language of the Congress at that time.
('71', 175, 1, 26, 372853) Vithalbhai 1 cajoled me.
('71', 175, 1, 27, 372878) But what shall I say of my shame?
('71', 175, 1, 28, 372912) What shall I say of Sardars shame?
('71', 175, 1, 29, 372947) Even today Bardoli has not fulfilled the condition of the charkha.
('71', 175, 1, 30, 373014) Prohibition has not been achieved nor has untouchability been eradicated.
('71', 175, 1, 31, 373088) Today I would not launch a campaign on the strength of Bardoli.
('71', 175, 1, 32, 373152) But this is my way of political education.
('71', 175, 1, 33, 373195) If the Congress tries some other method it will not succeed.
('71', 175, 1, 34, 373256) I am not saying this out of pride.
('71', 175, 1, 35, 373291) It only shows how unshakable is my faith.
('71', 175, 1, 36, 373333) If the Congress does not have faith in these things, why does it not give them up?
('71', 175, 1, 37, 373416) I say with all the force I can command that if these things are bad or useless they should not be accepted out of consideration for Gandhi.
('71', 175, 1, 38, 373556) Balubhai has passed M.A., L.L.B., but that does not mean that he remembers what he read of politics.
('71', 175, 1, 39, 373657) And he is not the only one.
('71', 175, 1, 40, 373685) We, all of us, educated people, have proved ineffective in giving political education to the people.
('71', 175, 1, 41, 373786) Our English education has made us useless.
('71', 175, 1, 42, 373829) The heritage left by out forefathers has been squandered.

('71', 176, 1, 2, 373953) I must tell you that it is only through these things that political education can be carried on.
('71', 176, 1, 3, 374050) It is not something separate.
('71', 176, 1, 4, 374080) If it is our conviction that the charkha in itself constitutes political education we shall not get tired or accept defeat.
('71', 176, 1, 5, 374204) If socialists come let them.
('71', 176, 1, 6, 374233) They are my friends.
('71', 176, 1, 7, 374254) They do not quarrel with me and I do not wish to quarrel with them.
('71', 176, 1, 8, 374322) They want to conduct political education by a different method.
('71', 176, 1, 9, 374386) Their means and mine differ.
('71', 176, 1, 10, 374415) But our goal is the same.
('71', 176, 1, 11, 374441) I put the same programme before them, too.
('71', 176, 1, 12, 374484) I also say that all land belongs to God.
('71', 176, 1, 13, 374525) But merely on the basis of this the socialists cannot claim all land as their property.
('71', 176, 1, 14, 374613) I cannot today advocate talking away land from those who own it.
('71', 176, 1, 15, 374678) I too want that we should all be possessors of Jamnalaljis wealth, but all the 30 crores of our people, not I alone.
('71', 176, 1, 16, 374795) All land belongs to God, that is, to the people.
('71', 176, 1, 17, 374844) But doesnt this mean that Jamnalaljis land should be partitioned in 30 crores little bits?
('71', 176, 1, 18, 374935) How are these 30 crores to become owners of the land?
('71', 176, 1, 19, 374989) Who should make them owners or make themselves the owners on their behalf is the question.
('71', 176, 1, 20, 375080) Someone has to come forward as their representative.
('71', 176, 1, 21, 375133) Therefore if Jamnalalji becomes our trustee and remembers that this wealth belongs to 30 crores of people, what is the harm?
('71', 176, 1, 22, 375258) He has given me all the Sevagram land.
('71', 176, 1, 23, 375297) But I cannot take it, for I am a fool.
('71', 176, 1, 24, 375336) I do not understand these things.
('71', 176, 1, 25, 375370) His manager understands them better than I. Today I take all the profit, he takes all the loss.
('71', 176, 1, 26, 375466) If you want to make use of the wealth of rich men like Jamnalalji and Rameshwardas Birla, make use of my talent.
('71', 176, 1, 27, 375579) I cannot derive much profit from the Segaon property because I have neither men nor the intelligence.
('71', 176, 1, 28, 375681) I do not want even a cowrie from outside Segaon.
('71', 176, 1, 29, 375730) I have all the means; only I have been slack.
('71', 176, 1, 30, 375776) Today if I build a house he has to pay for it.
('71', 176, 1, 31, 375823) This is hundred per cent true.
('71', 176, 1, 32, 375854) I grab as much as I can digest.
('71', 176, 1, 33, 375886) What more can I ask from any rich man?
('71', 176, 1, 34, 375925) Come, I invite you to go to some other village of Jamnalalji and settle there in the way I have settled in Seagon.
('71', 176, 1, 35, 376040) But the man should be one approved by me and willing to carry out my programme.
('71', 176, 1, 36, 376120) This however is an entirely different matter.
('71', 176, 1, 37, 376166) My subject was the charkha.
('71', 176, 1, 38, 376194) There was a time when C. P. Ramaswamy Aiyar thought that the charkha was a political weapon.
('71', 176, 1, 39, 376287) Mohammed Ali called it our gun, Khadilkar cited a verse from the Gita.
('71', 176, 2, 40, 376358) Here no effort undertaken is lost, no disaster befalls. Even better than this is the second half: Even a little of this righteous course delivers one from great fear. I do not regret my friendship with Mohammed Ali.
('71', 176, 2, 41, 376574) He was an honest and godfearing man.
('71', 176, 2, 42, 376611) He used to say what he considered moral
('71', 176, 3, 43, 376651) 1 Bhagavad Gita, II.
('71', 177, 0, 1, 376672) 178 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 177, 1, 2, 376714) and true at that time.
('71', 177, 1, 3, 376737) Yet he also said that in the path of God it is permissible for us to take up the sword and even to utter falsehoods.
('71', 177, 1, 4, 376854) But people of all religions say this.
('71', 177, 1, 5, 376892) Among Christians also there is no restriction.
('71', 177, 1, 6, 376939) The sanatanists say it openly, and even cite a verse from Manusmriti as authotity, that uttering of untruth is permissible for saving a cow, when talking to women and on such occasions as marriage, etc.
('71', 177, 1, 7, 377142) Even adharma becomes established in the name of dharma.
('71', 177, 1, 8, 377198) But it shows the majesty of dharma.
('71', 177, 1, 9, 377234) Sanatanists tell me that I am a heretic, that I know nothing of dharma and adharma, that my truth is more harmful than untruth.
('71', 177, 1, 10, 377362) This shows how far adharma can go in the name of dharma.
('71', 177, 1, 11, 377419) It is true that we go to the villages to impart political education to the people.
('71', 177, 1, 12, 377502) But as I am trying to say, the way of political education is the furthering of constructive programme.
('71', 177, 1, 13, 377605) We should not even utter the word political among the people.
('71', 177, 1, 14, 377667) The same applies to dharma.
('71', 177, 1, 15, 377695) We should not even mention the word dharma.
('71', 177, 1, 16, 377739) Tell them simply to clean their lavatories well and to bathe.
('71', 177, 1, 17, 377801) But dharma is beyond their comprehension.
('71', 177, 1, 18, 377843) This is not a result of their inferiority but of our littleness.
('71', 177, 1, 19, 377908) I hesitate to talk to them about truth and non violence.
('71', 177, 1, 20, 377965) We have kept them suppressed.
('71', 177, 1, 21, 377995) I can only talk to them about the way they should conduct themselves.
('71', 177, 1, 22, 378065) How can I speak to them about brahmacharya.
('71', 177, 1, 23, 378109) They cannot even pronounce the word.
('71', 177, 1, 24, 378146) When they pronounce it as bharamchar 1 and cannot even understand it, it is bharamchar for them.
('71', 177, 1, 25, 378243) I want to understand their morals.
('71', 177, 1, 26, 378278) I want to win their confidence.
('71', 177, 1, 27, 378310) If one of them comes to me and says he has relations with his sister in law how can I condemn him?
('71', 177, 1, 28, 378409) The sin is on our heads.
('71', 177, 1, 29, 378434) I want to teach them bit by bit without mentioning truth and non violence.
('71', 177, 1, 30, 378509) I know no other way.
('71', 177, 1, 31, 378530) If we want non violent swaraj it can come only thus and here no one can oppose us, whether it be England or America.
('71', 177, 1, 32, 378647) The question that Balubhai now asks was answered by me 17 years ago.
('71', 177, 1, 33, 378716) In 1920 everyone was mad about the charkhaMotilalji, Mohammed Ali, Shaukat Ali, Abbas Tyabji and others.
('71', 177, 1, 34, 378821) Everyone had started spinning.
('71', 177, 1, 35, 378852) Everyone thought that nothing was to be gained through Parliament.
('71', 177, 1, 36, 378919) Today I have become much more tolerant, so that I can even permit people going into Parliament.
('71', 177, 1, 37, 379015) This is a well tried method of giving political education.
('71', 177, 1, 38, 379074) This is the way people can be trained.
('71', 177, 1, 39, 379113) If Segaon tomorrow becomes self sufficient, if people keep the village clean, do not covet even a pie of anothers, what more will be lacking for their freedom?
('71', 177, 1, 40, 379273) They will say: Who is Jamnalal Sheth?
('71', 177, 1, 41, 379311) We till the land and it is ours.
('71', 177, 1, 42, 379344) The land was there before Jamnalalji was born.
('71', 177, 1, 43, 379391) We shall not

('71', 178, 0, 1, 379425) VOL.71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 179
('71', 178, 1, 2, 379468) be frightened.
('71', 178, 1, 3, 379483) We shall not resort to hooliganism.
('71', 178, 1, 4, 379519) If Jamnalaljis manager comes we shall not assault him.
('71', 178, 1, 5, 379574) We shall simply remove him from our land. These things will have to be taught to them.
('71', 178, 1, 6, 379661) Granted that people are the real owners of the land.
('71', 178, 1, 7, 379714) But how am I to get it accepted?
('71', 178, 1, 8, 379747) There are only two ways.
('71', 178, 1, 9, 379772) Force and persuasion.
('71', 178, 1, 10, 379794) The way of persuasion is the way of dharma.
('71', 178, 1, 11, 379838) If you cannot adopt it, then what Kishorelal says is true.
('71', 178, 1, 12, 379897) Then the socialists will prove that they had been in the right.
('71', 178, 1, 13, 379961) Then I shall have to tell you to follow them.
('71', 178, 1, 14, 380007) They also stand for the good of the people.
('71', 178, 1, 15, 380051) If they cannot influence the people it would be a matter of shame to me.
('71', 178, 1, 16, 380124) But you came into the field of service before they did.
('71', 178, 1, 17, 380180) You have also worked very hard.
('71', 178, 1, 18, 380212) If you cannot influence people it would be a matter of greater shame to me.
('71', 178, 1, 19, 380288) But how is this to be done?
('71', 178, 1, 20, 380316) Merely repeating constructive programme like a parrot will not do.
('71', 178, 1, 21, 380383) Your programme is more vigorous than that of the Spinners Association.
('71', 178, 1, 22, 380454) In the Spinners Association there are some people who fulfil the tasks allotted to them.
('71', 178, 1, 23, 380543) But among you there are those who have intelligently and thoughtfully developed it into a science.
('71', 178, 1, 24, 380642) The spheres of work of the Spinners Association and the Village Industries Association are limited.
('71', 178, 1, 25, 380742) The same is true of bodies like Goseva Sangh.
('71', 178, 1, 26, 380788) Your sphere of work is wider.
('71', 178, 1, 27, 380818) The Gandhi Seva Sangh is a large organization.
('71', 178, 1, 28, 380865) It is not a rival of the Congress.
('71', 178, 1, 29, 380900) The Congress too is a large organization.
('71', 178, 1, 30, 380942) But it has been built by the people.
('71', 178, 1, 31, 380979) It reflects the strength as well as the weakness of the people.
('71', 178, 1, 32, 381043) But your organization is voluntary.
('71', 178, 1, 33, 381079) It is a coming together of those who have undertaken to fulfil the entire programme issuing from truth and non violence.
('71', 178, 1, 34, 381200) It is a mighty tree of which Spinners Association and Village Industries Association are branches.
('71', 178, 1, 35, 381299) The Sangh is indicative of your strength.
('71', 178, 1, 36, 381341) Or should I say the power of truth and non violence will find expression through it?
('71', 178, 1, 37, 381426) Jamnalalji may well have built it up, but it is not his organization.
('71', 178, 1, 38, 381496) He himself became only an ordinary member and said that he would never become an office bearer.
('71', 178, 1, 39, 381592) This shows not only his humility but also his wisdom.
('71', 178, 1, 40, 381646) We want to bring about an all round advancement of India through what we call constructive work.
('71', 178, 1, 41, 381743) There are various organizations which have taken up each a separate item of the programme.
('71', 178, 1, 42, 381834) Your work should be an example to them.
('71', 178, 1, 43, 381874) Today one cannot say it is.
('71', 178, 1, 44, 381902) We must, therefore, very clearly declare that our work is constructive work and that we are going into Parliament for furthering that work.
('71', 178, 1, 45, 382042) If what I have said has not satisfied you entirely, the reason can only be that I have not been able to couch my language in legalistic
('71', 179, 0, 1, 382178) 180 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 179, 1, 2, 382220) phraseology.
('71', 179, 1, 3, 382233) But it is clearer than day before yesterday.
('71', 179, 1, 4, 382278) My language is imperfect.
('71', 179, 1, 5, 382304) The language of one who is himself imperfect must be imperfect, too.
('71', 179, 1, 6, 382373) If after 17 years of explaining I have not been able to explain myself, then I am imperfect and so are you who cannot understand.
('71', 179, 1, 7, 382503) Thakkar has sent me a letter.
('71', 179, 1, 8, 382533) It is an interesting letter worth reading out.
('71', 179, 1, 9, 382580) I have not the time but I must read out to you just one sentence from this letter.
('71', 179, 1, 10, 382663) He says: Last year I had to be in Dhulia itself and I may have to live there in future, too, but my faith in village work has not diminished one jot and no desire has arisen in me for life in a city. The workers who have not wholly given up the love for city life have had their faith in the charkha somewhat slackened.
('71', 179, 1, 11, 382983) This gives rise to doubts.
('71', 179, 1, 12, 383010) To me the charkha is everything.
('71', 179, 1, 13, 383043) I am living in a village and devote most of my time to the charkha.
('71', 179, 1, 14, 383111) About political matters I merely offer advice and then forget about it.
('71', 179, 1, 15, 383183) I do my writing for the constructive programme and for it I work.
('71', 179, 1, 16, 383249) I do not despair though the members of the Gandhi Seva Sangh have not been doing their work with full awakening.
('71', 179, 1, 17, 383362) The charkha work does not end with giving women two pice or two annas.
('71', 179, 1, 18, 383433) If through the charkha we cannot develop our minds, then we should let it go.
('71', 179, 1, 19, 383511) It is my faith that the charkha will bring us swaraj.
('71', 179, 1, 20, 383565) Kishorelal seems to fear that you have accepted the charkha for my sake and that you will give it up when I am no more.
('71', 179, 1, 21, 383685) He therefore wants to keep you away from temptations.
('71', 179, 1, 22, 383739) Even if I should be the only one with faith in the charkha, I shall be proud to die working for it.
('71', 179, 1, 23, 383839) My pride while plying the charkha or serving the Harijans will be pardonable.
('71', 179, 1, 24, 383917) After all we have to commune with God through some means or other.
('71', 179, 1, 25, 383984) Why not then through the charkha?
('71', 179, 1, 26, 384018) You may say that I have worked for the charkha or that the charkha has worked for me.
('71', 179, 1, 27, 384104) If the devotee is the slave of God, God also is the slave of the devotees slave.
('71', 179, 1, 28, 384185) It is in this sense I am speaking to you.
('71', 179, 1, 29, 384227) If we cannot create an atmosphere in which the charkha can bring about the development of the mind, Kanti and Bal have no alternative but to go to the college.
('71', 179, 1, 30, 384387) They do not have the originality of Ekalavya.
('71', 179, 1, 31, 384433) If you understand what I am trying to say, there will be no reason for you to be in two minds.
('71', 179, 1, 32, 384528) The main thing is concentrationone pointedness of attention.
('71', 179, 1, 33, 384589) Kishorelal prepared his speech with such concentration as if it was meant for the entire world.
('71', 179, 1, 34, 384685) I was witness to it.
('71', 179, 1, 35, 384706) To him the Sangh is the whole world.
('71', 179, 1, 36, 384743) He also prepared a summary of it for your convenience.
('71', 179, 1, 37, 384798) He works without attachment.
('71', 179, 1, 38, 384827) He is another Yudhishthira, which I am not.
('71', 179, 1, 39, 384871) I shall be happy if I can acquire the strength of even a Bhima or an Arjuna.
('71', 179, 1, 40, 384948) People call me a karmayogi.
('71', 179, 1, 41, 384976) I do not know whether I am a karmayogi
('71', 180, 0, 1, 385015) VOL.71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 181
('71', 180, 1, 2, 385058) or any other yogi, but I cannot live without workthis I know.
('71', 180, 1, 3, 385120) When something sinks into my heart, I cannot be at peace till I have put it into practice.
('71', 180, 1, 4, 385211) People may say I am mad in saying that I wish to die with the charkha in my hand.
('71', 180, 1, 5, 385293) I do not wish to die holding a string of beads.
('71', 180, 1, 6, 385341) For concentration the charkha is my beads.
('71', 180, 1, 7, 385384) God appears to me in thousands of forms.
('71', 180, 1, 8, 385425) Sometimes I see him in the charkha, sometimes in Hindu Muslim unity, sometimes in the eradication of untouchability.
('71', 180, 1, 9, 385542) I move as my feeling draws me.
('71', 180, 1, 10, 385573) When I wish to enter a room in an institution, I do so and I feel there the presence of God.
('71', 180, 1, 11, 385666) In the Gita God has said that He looks to the well being of those who worship Him.
('71', 180, 1, 12, 385749) You must be firm in this faith if you have understood me.

('71', 180, 3, 15, 385901) 175. SPEECH AT GANDHI SEVA SANGH MEETING, HUDLI IV
('71', 180, 4, 16, 385952) HUDLI, April 20, 1937 Let me now come to Mamas proposal.
('71', 180, 4, 17, 386009) The proposal is: Since it is the aim of the Sangh to look upon the constructive programme of the Indian National Congress as a dharma and make it a success, in a programme like the removal of untouchability it is the duty of the members of the Sangh to come into direct contact with sweepers and other Harijan brethren and convince them as well as others that they make no distinctions in their treatment of the Harijans.
('71', 180, 4, 18, 386431) Let them give a place to Harijans in their homes, receive Harijans in the same way as they would receive others, seek opportunities to eat with them.
('71', 180, 4, 19, 386581) Let them keep some Harijan members in their houses, bring up some Harijan children, go to the Harijan colonies and serve them in various ways and lovingly participate in their work and prove thereby that none of the jobs the Harijans have to do is lowly.
('71', 180, 5, 20, 386836) VALLABHBHAI PATEL: This proposal justifies the fear of the sanatanists.
('71', 180, 6, 21, 386908) From removal of untouchability you want to proceed step by step to intermarriage.
('71', 180, 6, 22, 386990) (Laughter) GANDHIJI: For ordinary people, removal of untouchability is sufficient.
('71', 180, 6, 23, 387073) But, for you, mere touch is not enough.
('71', 180, 6, 24, 387113) You must continue to proceed further.
('71', 180, 6, 25, 387151) Your field of progress is unlimited.
('71', 180, 6, 26, 387188) Ordinary people can look up only to the sky.
('71', 180, 6, 27, 387233) But scientists claim that they can
('71', 181, 0, 1, 387268) 182 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 181, 1, 2, 387310) look through the whole expanse of the milky way.
('71', 181, 1, 3, 387359) It is not known if something exists beyond that.
('71', 181, 1, 4, 387408) But truth pierces through the sky and reaches beyond.
('71', 181, 1, 5, 387462) We have to imbibe truth in our lives.
('71', 181, 1, 6, 387500) We find that under the guise of truth, untruth is being respected by people.
('71', 181, 1, 7, 387577) It is the aim of religion to strengthen the idea of brotherhood, to minimize the unnatural distinctions between man and man.
('71', 181, 1, 8, 387702) But today, in the very name of religion, the Harijans are being treated with contempt.
('71', 181, 1, 9, 387789) I have already said that untruth, by itself, is powerless, it is dependent.
('71', 181, 1, 10, 387865) It can never stand on its own without the support of truth.
('71', 181, 1, 11, 387925) But I wish to point out to you that if untruth can succeed so much in the name of truth, how much more would truth itself succeed?
('71', 181, 1, 12, 388056) Who can measure the extent of its success?
('71', 181, 1, 13, 388099) For us, who are the members of the Sangh, there should be no place for any unjust distinctions in our hearts.
('71', 181, 1, 14, 388209) It may seem strange, but as far as I am concerned, such a feeling of distinction disappeared from the day I ate a bit of mutton with a Muslim boy.
('71', 181, 1, 15, 388356) 1 Eating mutton was and is a bad thing.
('71', 181, 1, 16, 388396) But this small thing saved me from something else as well.
('71', 181, 1, 17, 388455) By tasting a little mutton I realized that there was nothing particularly to rave about it.
('71', 181, 1, 18, 388547) That saved me in England and I did not betray my mother.
('71', 181, 1, 19, 388604) I have not spoken to the millions about interdining and intermarriage.
('71', 181, 1, 20, 388675) We do not have inter dining and intermarriage even with Brahmins.
('71', 181, 1, 21, 388741) My mother, while observing some pious vows, would not take food even from my hands.
('71', 181, 1, 22, 388825) The Hindu masses still follow quite a few restrictive practices in the matter of inter dining and intermarriage.
('71', 181, 1, 23, 388938) Even I have followed certain restrictions in this regard.
('71', 181, 1, 24, 388996) That is the reason why I have not spoken to the masses about these.
('71', 181, 1, 25, 389064) But if I suggest to you that you should go to the extent of inter dining and intermarrying with Harijans I would not be violating truth.
('71', 181, 1, 26, 389201) Let me talk to you on a religious point.
('71', 181, 1, 27, 389242) I am talking about religion as a matter of day to day practice.
('71', 181, 1, 28, 389306) It is not something related to any particular occasion.
('71', 181, 1, 29, 389362) You have really not much control in the matter of intermarriage.
('71', 181, 1, 30, 389427) You should certainly not bring compulsion on your children in this matter.
('71', 181, 1, 31, 389502) Inter dining is a different matter.
('71', 181, 1, 32, 389538) If your mother says that it is irreligion, you must tell her that you would take the food cooked by her as well as the food cooked by an untouchable, and it would not matter that you were forsaken by her on that account.
('71', 181, 1, 33, 389759) You cannot compel your mother or even your wife.
('71', 181, 1, 34, 389808) We must have two separate establishments in such a situation.
('71', 181, 1, 35, 389870) If wecannot exercise force over them, we cannot do it over religion either.
('71', 181, 1, 36, 389946) In other words, we cannot coerce our own sons.
('71', 181, 1, 37, 389993) Our mothers and wives may well consider it their duty to forsake us.
('71', 181, 1, 38, 390062) Let us stay apart without

('71', 182, 1, 2, 390177) being enemies of each other.
('71', 182, 1, 3, 390206) In such a situation I would treat them more affectionately.
('71', 182, 1, 4, 390266) I would try not to hurt their feelings.
('71', 182, 1, 5, 390306) But at the same time I would not hurt the feelings of Harijans in order to please them.
('71', 182, 1, 6, 390394) Only truth and Hinduism can teach me this.
('71', 182, 1, 7, 390437) For me, religion, truth and Hinduism are inter changeable terms.
('71', 182, 1, 8, 390502) If there is an element of untruth in Hinduism, I cannot accept that particular aspect of Hinduism as religion.
('71', 182, 1, 9, 390613) If, on this account, the entire Hindu community forsakes me and I am left all alone, I would still proclaim that I am not alone, they who forsake me are alone.
('71', 182, 1, 10, 390773) For, truth is on my side.
('71', 182, 1, 11, 390799) And truth is God Himself .
('71', 182, 2, 12, 390826) I would accept the hospitality even from a leper.
('71', 182, 2, 13, 390876) But the manner of acceptance would be different.
('71', 182, 2, 14, 390925) I would tell him affectionately that he should allow me to cook the food and fetch the water.
('71', 182, 2, 15, 391019) As far as I am personally concerned, for the sake of love, I would even take the food and the water offered by a leper if he really insists.
('71', 182, 2, 16, 391160) I would be even willing to die for his love.
('71', 182, 2, 17, 391205) But the whole world cannot accept his hospitality in this spirit.
('71', 182, 2, 18, 391271) Hence, I too would accept it in the same manner that the entire society can accept.
('71', 182, 2, 19, 391355) I followed the same principle in the case of Parachure Shastri.
('71', 182, 2, 20, 391419) But that is a different case.
('71', 182, 2, 21, 391449) We should not confuse diesease with the issue of untouchability.
('71', 182, 2, 22, 391514) They are two absolutely different problems.
('71', 182, 2, 23, 391558) The question relating to the sweeper is altogether different from the question relating to the leper.
('71', 182, 2, 24, 391660) We have an opportunity of teaching the sweeper habits of cleanliness if we come in greater contact with him.
('71', 182, 2, 25, 391769) And, is it not also true that if any sweeper invites me or you for a meal he would himself be concerned about washing himself clean and donning clean clothes and offer us cleanly prepared food?
('71', 182, 2, 26, 391963) Please do not confuse the issue of poverty with this.
('71', 182, 2, 27, 392017) The problem of poverty is economic, whereas the problem of abolition of untouchability is religious or spiritual.
('71', 182, 2, 28, 392131) My religion will not be destroyed if I do not solve the problem of poverty of a poor peasant.
('71', 182, 2, 29, 392225) But if I allow the untouchability to persist even in the case of a wealthy Harijan, my religion will cease to exist.
('71', 182, 2, 30, 392342) That is the reason why the begining of an act of service should be only with the Harijan.
('71', 182, 3, 31, 392432) Then Gandhiji moved the following resolution pertaining to goseva.
('71', 182, 4, 32, 392499) Economic and moral uplift of India is one of the aims of the Sangh and the protection of our cows is non violence in its concrete from and it implies economic benefits to millions of people.
('71', 182, 4, 33, 392690) That is why the attention of the members of the Sangh is being drawn towards goseva.
('71', 182, 4, 34, 392775) It is the duty of
('71', 182, 5, 35, 392793) 1 Someone had interposed that Harijans would have to be careful about cleanliness if others were to eat with them, for one could not accept hospitality from a leper.
('71', 183, 0, 1, 392959) 184 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 183, 1, 2, 393001) the members of the Sangh to study animal husbandry as much as possible and try their utmost to protect our cows.
('71', 183, 1, 3, 393114) The least they can do is to use cows milk and its products instead of buffalos milk, etc., as far as possible, and make cows milk and its products popular.
('71', 183, 1, 4, 393270) I am not laying any particular stress on this resolution today.
('71', 183, 1, 5, 393334) If there is doubt in your mind and you wish to discuss it, we may as well abandon it.
('71', 183, 1, 6, 393420) For, this is a novel thing.
('71', 183, 1, 7, 393448) Its language is distinct from that of the Congress.
('71', 183, 1, 8, 393500) The things Kishorelal mentioned in the course of his introductory speech are easy no doubt; but they cannot provide enough work.
('71', 183, 1, 9, 393629) As the issue in this form concerns none but the Hindus, I did not bring this proposal before the Congress.
('71', 183, 1, 10, 393736) This is an inseparable part of Hinduism.
('71', 183, 1, 11, 393777) The sanatanists consider my way of goseva as a thing to be shunned and partonize goseva organizations.
('71', 183, 1, 12, 393880) But this is their gross ignorance.
('71', 183, 1, 13, 393915) I have described the popular practice of goseva as the devouring of cows.
('71', 183, 1, 14, 393989) And, I have still not withdrawn my words.
('71', 183, 1, 15, 394031) People are terribly angry with me on this account.
('71', 183, 1, 16, 394082) But, even if they sever my head, I would say only what is truth.
('71', 183, 1, 17, 394147) Our religion exhorts us first to protect the cow and then the Brahmin.
('71', 183, 1, 18, 394218) Cow protection is an inseparable part of our religion.
('71', 183, 1, 19, 394273) But today we do not protect, but rather devour our cows.
('71', 183, 1, 20, 394330) We should lay down our lives for the sake of the cow.
('71', 183, 1, 21, 394384) But today we are allowing the cow to die for us.
('71', 183, 1, 22, 394433) Hinduism generally regards suicide as a sin.
('71', 183, 1, 23, 394478) But in certain situations, our religion not only permits but also exhorts us to resort to suicide.
('71', 183, 1, 24, 394577) In view of this, we must kill ourselves if it is necessary in order to save the cow.
('71', 183, 1, 25, 394662) All that this resolution lays down is that the members of the Sangh should insist on using only cows milk and ghee.
('71', 183, 1, 26, 394778) It is not a question of taking a vow.
('71', 183, 1, 27, 394816) Insisting on cows milk means that if it is necessary to take buffalos milk or ghee to save life, it should be taken.
('71', 183, 1, 28, 394933) But if it is a vow, it leaves no such scope.
('71', 183, 1, 29, 394978) If you wish, instead of saying insist on using you may say as far as possible use which would soften both the language and the sentiment.
('71', 183, 1, 30, 395116) Tomorrow if I go to Dhotres house, I would insist and I must.
('71', 183, 1, 31, 395178) I would do the same everywhere.
('71', 183, 1, 32, 395210) For me as far as possible is a meaningless phrase.
('71', 183, 2, 33, 395261) VALLABHBHAI PATEL: One who is ill or has to be always travelling, cannot even insist.
('71', 183, 2, 34, 395347) GANDHIJI: In such a situation, insistence would include taking buffalos milk or ghee.
('71', 183, 2, 35, 395433) Saying as far as possible is a different thing.
('71', 183, 2, 36, 395481) It commits you to nothing.
('71', 183, 2, 37, 395508) I look at it from the point of view of religion.
('71', 183, 2, 38, 395557) And for me, service of religion and service of the country mean the same thing.
('71', 183, 2, 39, 395637) That is the responsibility of persons like Jamnalalji.
('71', 183, 2, 40, 395692) I have got a

('71', 184, 1, 3, 395779) 1 Why cant they throw away a couple of lakhs in that experiment?
('71', 184, 2, 4, 395844) Discussing the next annual meeting of the Sangh and invitations from Bengal, U.P. and Utkal for this Gandhiji said: I am particularly partial to Orissa.
('71', 184, 2, 5, 395997) We can also expect to raise larger funds there that at Hudli.
('71', 184, 2, 6, 396059) But, in my view, it would not be proper to give travelling expenses.
('71', 184, 2, 7, 396128) The members must attend the convention at their own expense.
('71', 184, 2, 8, 396189) As for those who cannot spend their own money, Gopa Babu can collect the necessary sums to be given to them on the recommendation of the office.
('71', 184, 2, 9, 396334) And, if even he cannot make such an arrangement, those members should not be invited.
('71', 184, 2, 10, 396420) But under no circumstances should the Sangh give travelling expenses.
('71', 184, 2, 11, 396490) Gopa Babu has agreed to all the conditions.
('71', 184, 2, 12, 396534) There is one more reason.
('71', 184, 2, 13, 396560) The Congress has done the least amount of work in Orissa.
('71', 184, 2, 14, 396618) It is a miracle that the Congress has won a majority there.
('71', 184, 2, 15, 396678) Only one of the Congress candidates was defeated there, and even that on my account.
('71', 184, 2, 16, 396763) He was such a naive person that it was good for the Congress that he was defeated.
('71', 184, 2, 17, 396846) The poor Oriyas are considered to be slack people.
('71', 184, 2, 18, 396897) When they are giving an invitation, we must forget about Bihar and Bengal.
('71', 184, 2, 19, 396972) I had followed the same principle in deciding in favour of Gujarat for the Congress.
('71', 184, 2, 20, 397057) It was a tussle between Ras and Bardoli.
('71', 184, 2, 21, 397098) I said that Ras had a stronger case and should give in.
('71', 184, 2, 22, 397154) Hence the partiality to Bardoli even at the cost of hurting Ras.

('71', 185, 8, 17, 398719) CORRESPONDENT: You say you do not seek any the slightest abrogation of the Government of India Act.
('71', 185, 8, 18, 398819) Do you not thereby mean that you do not want an immediate amendment but that you contemplate it at some time?
('71', 185, 8, 19, 398929) GANDHIJI: That is wholly a mistaken view.
('71', 185, 8, 20, 398971) I want no amendment whatsoever, immediate or distant.
('71', 185, 8, 21, 399025) For the Congress insists, so do I, on the complete repeal of the Act so that it might be substituted at the earliest possible moment by an Act of the people themselves.
('71', 185, 8, 22, 399194) What I want, before Congressmen accept office, is an assurance which I still hold is within the power of the Governors to give, that they will not interfere with the day to day administration of the Province.
('71', 185, 8, 23, 399403) For, under the Act, it is not they but the Ministers who are responsible for the administration of the Province within the sphere prescribed by the
('71', 185, 9, 24, 399551) 1 The special correspondent had reported: In the last two or three days, I have had the privilege of fairly long conversations on the political situation with Mahatma Gandhi.
('71', 185, 9, 25, 399726) My purpose was to try and clarify and, if possible, to determine the precise scope of the assurances demanded of the Governors by the leaders of the Congress in the six Provinces where the Congress has been returned in a majority in the last electiuos.
('71', 185, 9, 26, 399979) The final interview which I had this morning on reaching Poona, and of which a report is given below, sums up the present position of the Congress in this matter.
('71', 186, 0, 1, 400142) VOL.71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 187
('71', 186, 1, 2, 400185) All talk, therefore, of the constitutional inability of the Governors to give an assurance baffles me and makes me suspect the motives of the British politicians who have the working of the Act within their power.
('71', 186, 1, 3, 400399) Do you mean that under no circumstances whatsoever can a Governor interfere if an emergency of a grave nature in his opinion arises?
('71', 186, 1, 4, 400532) That is a fair question.
('71', 186, 1, 5, 400557) I certainly do not mean any such thing.
('71', 186, 1, 6, 400597) I can conceive of the possibility of a Minister making a stupid blunder, so as to harm the people in whose name he is acting.
('71', 186, 1, 7, 400723) The Governors duty will then be plain.
('71', 186, 1, 8, 400762) He would reason with the Ministers and if the Ministers do not listen, he will dismiss the Cabinet.
('71', 186, 1, 9, 400862) The assurance contemplates non interference, not non dismissal.
('71', 186, 1, 10, 400926) But dismissal when there is a clear majority in the Assembly would mean dissolution and fresh election.
('71', 186, 1, 11, 401030) That will always be open to the Governor to precipitate, as it would be open to the Provincial Cabinet to do.
('71', 186, 1, 12, 401140) But such a crisis cannot occur from day to day.
('71', 186, 1, 13, 401188) What, therefore, I want is an absolutely honourable understanding which is incapable of a double interpretation by honourable parties.
('71', 186, 2, 14, 401323) May I then take it that you would not mind such assurances being given even in Provinces where the Congress is not in a majority?
('71', 186, 2, 15, 401453) So fat as I am concerned, not only would I not mind it as a confirmed democrat, I would not have for the Congress what may not be given to other parties where they enjoy a clear majority.
('71', 186, 3, 16, 401641) I take it you are aware of the special responsibilities of the Governors.
('71', 186, 3, 17, 401715) I am afraid I must confess my ignorance.
('71', 186, 4, 18, 401756) May I then tell you that they are responsible when there is a grave menace to peace and tranquillity or to the legitimate rights of the minorities or to Service rights, Indian States, etc.?
('71', 186, 4, 19, 401946) But if the Governors are reponsible, Ministers who are worth their salt are surely still more responsible for peace and tranquillity, for the actual protection of the rights of the minorities, rights of the Statesif by States is meant the people of the States as well as the Princes.
('71', 186, 4, 20, 402230) I cannot imagine rights of Princes against the people within their jurisdiction.
('71', 186, 4, 21, 402311) And even in all these, the pity of it is that the so called autonomy has been boiled down so much by statue that the Governors discretion is extremely limited.
('71', 186, 4, 22, 402471) There is one thing, however, if I were a Congress Minister I would not be willingly responsible for, as I would be for other things you have mentionedI mean the rights of the Services.
('71', 186, 4, 23, 402656) By that one guarantee, in my opinion, the framers of the Act have reduced autonomy to a farce.
('71', 186, 4, 24, 402751) But under the assurance I have contemplated, I have not envisaged a reduction of those rights which are guaranteed by the Act itself.
('71', 186, 4, 25, 402885) While the Act
('71', 187, 0, 1, 402899) 188 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 187, 1, 2, 402941) remains in force the Congress Ministers will take office knowing well the handicap under which they will labour from the very commencement of their career.
('71', 187, 1, 3, 403097) I nevertheless feel that, if the assurance contemplated by the Congress resolution is given, the Ministers can, in spite of the handicap, so consolidate their position that they can, even acting within the Constitution, compel the repeal of the Act and hasten the day of the meeting of the Constituent Assembly whose Act will be accepted by the British peopleunless they want to govern India by the naked sword.

('71', 187, 3, 6, 403574) POONA, April 22, 1937
('71', 187, 4, 7, 403596) When interviewed by the Associated Press regarding the Madras leaders appeal to the Congress and the Government for solving the present impasse, Mahatma Gandhi said: I read it with respectful attention and so far as I am concerned I hope I have made my position so clear as to leave no room for any misunderstanding.
('71', 187, 4, 8, 403913) I have also shown now, according to my interpretation, that the offic acceptance resolution is so eminently reasonable.
('71', 187, 4, 9, 404033) Therefore, their appeal needs an answer more from the Government than from me.

('71', 187, 6, 12, 404172) April 22, 1937 Having been buried in out of the way Kumri all these days, I had not seen the papers that you have kindly shown me.
('71', 187, 6, 13, 404303) It is very difficult for me to believe that the Maharaja of Cochin has passed the orders 2 described in the cutting before me.
('71', 187, 6, 14, 404430) I can understand his and his family members discontinuing worship in the Koodalmanikkam Temple, but I cannot understand the order that clearly interferes with the rights of the Maharaja of Travancore and the rights of priests who would be presumed to know religion as much as the Maharaja of Cochin himself.
('71', 187, 6, 15, 404738) And if it is true that the savarna Hindus who have visited Travancore temples are prohibited from entering the Cochin

('71', 188, 1, 2, 405006) temples and having access to wells, etc., apart from its being unworkable it is unsurpassed in irreligiousness.
('71', 188, 1, 3, 405118) I cannot understand how Sir Shanmukham Chetty could have failed to dissuade the Maharaja from the action which seems to me to be indefensible even from the point of view of staunch sanatanists.
('71', 188, 1, 4, 405312) I can only hope that the reports in the papers fail to give the correct version of the situation; and in any case I hope that better counsels will prevail in Cochin.

('71', 188, 3, 7, 405523) SEGAON, WARDHA, April 23, 1937
('71', 188, 4, 8, 405554) MY DEAR REBEL, Your letters before me.
('71', 188, 4, 9, 405593) Returned this morning.
('71', 188, 4, 10, 405616) This will go to Simla.
('71', 188, 4, 11, 405639) I have the prospectus, etc.
('71', 188, 4, 12, 405667) That letter was over weight and carried a fine of two annas.
('71', 188, 4, 13, 405728) It is so hot that we are melting.
('71', 188, 4, 14, 405762) I am in no mood to write at length.
('71', 188, 4, 15, 405798) Yes, I leave for Allahabad on 25th and return on 29th.
('71', 188, 4, 16, 405853) The weather this time has been cruel in so many parts of India.
('71', 188, 4, 17, 405917) What is this eczema again?
('71', 188, 4, 18, 405944) Do you mean the same patches?
('71', 188, 5, 19, 405974) Yours, ROBBER

('71', 188, 7, 22, 406055) 182. CURSE OF DRINK
('71', 188, 8, 23, 406075) A sister writes:
('71', 188, 9, 24, 406092) On going to the village, I was more than grieved to hear of the havoc drink is working among these people.
('71', 188, 9, 25, 406199) Some of the women were in tears.
('71', 188, 9, 26, 406232) What can they do?
('71', 188, 9, 27, 406250) There is not a woman who would not like to banish alcohol for all time from out midst.
('71', 188, 9, 28, 406337) It is the cause of so much domestic misery, poverty, ruined health and physique.
('71', 188, 9, 29, 406418) As usual it is the woman who has to bear the burden of this self indulgence on the part of man.
('71', 188, 9, 30, 406514) What can I advise the women to do?
('71', 188, 9, 31, 406549) It is so hard to face anger and even cruelty.
('71', 188, 9, 32, 406595) How I wish the leaders in this Province would concentrate on the removal of this evil rather than expend time, energy and brain on the injustice of the Communal Award.
('71', 188, 9, 33, 406763) We are so apt
('71', 189, 0, 1, 406777) 190 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 189, 1, 2, 406819) to neglect the things that really matter for such trivialities as would settle themselves if the moral stature of our people were raised.
('71', 189, 1, 3, 406957) Cant you write an appeal to the prople on the question of drink?
('71', 189, 1, 4, 407022) It is sad to see these people literally going to perdition because of the curse.
('71', 189, 1, 5, 407103) My appeal to those who drink will be vain.
('71', 189, 1, 6, 407146) It must be.
('71', 189, 1, 7, 407158) They never read Harijan.
('71', 189, 1, 8, 407183) If they do, they do so to scoff.
('71', 189, 1, 9, 407216) They can have no interest in being informed of the evil of the drink habit.
('71', 189, 1, 10, 407292) They hug the very evil.
('71', 189, 1, 11, 407316) But I would like to remind this sister, and through her all the women of India, that at the time of the Dandi march the women of India did listen to my advice and made the fight against drink and the plying of the wheel their speciality.
('71', 189, 1, 12, 407554) Let the writer recall the fact that thousands of women fearlessly surrounded drink shops and often successfully appealed to the addicts to give up the habit.
('71', 189, 1, 13, 407712) In the prosecution of their self imposed mission they put up with the abuses of the addicts and sometimes even assaults by them.
('71', 189, 1, 14, 407841) Hundreds went to gaol for the crime of picketing drink shops.
('71', 189, 1, 15, 407903) Their zealous work produced a marvellous effect all over the country.
('71', 189, 1, 16, 407973) But unfortunately with the cessation of civil disobedience, and even before the cessation, the work slackened.
('71', 189, 1, 17, 408084) Into the reasons for the slackening I need not go.
('71', 189, 1, 18, 408135) But the work still awaits workers.
('71', 189, 1, 19, 408170) The womens pledge remains unfulfilled.
('71', 189, 1, 20, 408209) It was not taken for a definite period only.
('71', 189, 1, 21, 408254) It could not be fulfilled until prohibition was proclaimed throughout India.
('71', 189, 1, 22, 408331) The womens was the nobler part.
('71', 189, 1, 23, 408363) Theirs was to bring about prohibition by emptying drink shops by an appeal to the best in man.
('71', 189, 1, 24, 408458) Could they have continued the work, their gentleness combined with earnestness would most assuredly have weaned the drunkard from his habit.
('71', 189, 1, 25, 408599) But nothing is lost.
('71', 189, 1, 26, 408620) The women can still organize the campaign.
('71', 189, 1, 27, 408663) If the wives of those of whom the writer writes are in earnest, they can surely convert their husbands.
('71', 189, 1, 28, 408767) Women do not know what influence for good they can exert on their husbands.
('71', 189, 1, 29, 408843) They wield it unconsciously no doubt, but that is not enough.
('71', 189, 1, 30, 408905) They must have that consciousness, and the consciousness will give them the strength and show them the way to deal with their partners.
('71', 189, 1, 31, 409041) The pity of it is that most wives do not interest themselves in their husbands doings.
('71', 189, 1, 32, 409128) They think they have no right to do so.
('71', 189, 1, 33, 409168) It never occurs to them that it is their duty to become guardians of their husbands character, as it is the latters to be guardians of their wives character.
('71', 189, 1, 34, 409326) And yet what can be plainer than that husband and wife are equal sharers of each others virtues and vices?
('71', 189, 1, 35, 409433) But who but a woman can effectively awaken the wives to a sense of their power and duty?
('71', 189, 1, 36, 409522) This is but a part of the womens movement against drink.
('71', 190, 0, 1, 409579) VOL.71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 191
('71', 190, 1, 2, 409622) There must be enough women with proper equipment to study the statistics of drink, the causes that induce the habit and the remedies against it.
('71', 190, 1, 3, 409767) They must learn the lesson from the past and realize that mere appeals to the addicts to give up drink cannot produce lasting effects.
('71', 190, 1, 4, 409902) The habit has to be regarded as a disease and treated as such.
('71', 190, 1, 5, 409965) In other words, some women have to become research students and carry on researches in a variety of ways.
('71', 190, 1, 6, 410071) In every branch of reform constant study giving one a mastery over ones subject is necessary.
('71', 190, 1, 7, 410165) Ignorance is at the root of failures, partial or complete, of all reform movements whose merits are admitted.
('71', 190, 1, 8, 410275) For every project masquerading under the name of reform is not necessarily worthy of bring so designated.
('71', 190, 1, 9, 410381) Harijan, 24 4 1937
('71', 190, 2, 10, 410400) 183. THE CAUSE OF IT
('71', 190, 3, 11, 410421) A Bangalore correspondent asks:
('71', 190, 4, 12, 410453) You say that a married couple may have sexual union only when there is a mutual desire for a child and on no other account.
('71', 190, 4, 13, 410577) Please let me know why one should wish for a child at all.
('71', 190, 4, 14, 410636) Many people wish for children without fully realizing the responsibilities of parenthood, and many more wish for children fully knowing that they are incapable of discharging the responsibilities of a parent.
('71', 190, 4, 15, 410845) Many persons who are physically and mentally unfit for parenthood wish for children.
('71', 190, 4, 16, 410930) Dont you think that it is wrong for these persons to procreate?
('71', 190, 5, 17, 410994) I would like to know the motive behind the desire for children.
('71', 190, 5, 18, 411058) Many people wish for children to bequeath their possesions and to break the monotony of their life.
('71', 190, 5, 19, 411158) A few people wish for a male child lest the gates of Heaven would not be opened for them.
('71', 190, 5, 20, 411248) Are not these prople wrong in wishing for a child?
('71', 190, 5, 21, 411299) It is good to seek causes for things.
('71', 190, 5, 22, 411337) But it is not always possible to discover them.
('71', 190, 5, 23, 411385) The desire for children is universal.
('71', 190, 5, 24, 411423) But I do not know any convincing cause, if to see oneself perpetuated through ones descendants is not a sufficient and convincing cause.
('71', 190, 5, 25, 411560) My proposition, however, is not vitiated if the cause I give for the desire is not found sufficiently convincing.
('71', 190, 5, 26, 411674) The desire is there.
('71', 190, 5, 27, 411695) It seems to be natural.
('71', 190, 5, 28, 411719) I am not sorry for having been born.
('71', 190, 5, 29, 411756) It cannot be unlawful for me to see the best in me reproduced.
('71', 190, 5, 30, 411819) Anyway till I see evil in procreation itself and till I see that the sexual act for mere pleasure is justifiable, I must hold that the sexual act is justified only where there is desire for children.
('71', 190, 5, 31, 412019) I understand that this was so clear to the makers of Smritis that Manu described only the first born as children born of
('71', 191, 0, 1, 412140) 192 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 191, 1, 2, 412182) dharma and the rest of kamalust.
('71', 191, 1, 3, 412215) The more throught I give to the subject as dispassionately as is possible, the more convinced I feel about the correctness of the position I have taken and am enforcing.
('71', 191, 1, 4, 412385) It is becoming clearer to me that the difficulty lies in our ignorance of the subject with which needless secrecy is being associated.
('71', 191, 1, 5, 412520) Our thought is clouded.
('71', 191, 1, 6, 412544) We dread to face consequences.
('71', 191, 1, 7, 412575) We resort to half measures as if they were perfect or final and thus render them most difficult of execution.
('71', 191, 1, 8, 412685) If our thoughts were clear, if we became sure of our ground, our speech and action would be firm.
('71', 191, 1, 9, 412783) Thus if I am sure that every morsel of food I take is for building and sustaining the body, I shall never desire to take food for the pleasure of the palate.
('71', 191, 1, 10, 412941) I shall further realize that if I have any desire to eat things because they are tasty, and apart from hunger or the thought of sustaining the body, it is a token of disease and I should seek to cure myself of it and not satisfy it as if it was lawful or healthy.
('71', 191, 1, 11, 413205) Even so if I am quite clear that the sexual act, apart from the unquestioned desire for progeny, is unlawful and detrimental to the body, mind and soul, surely resistance to the desire will become easy far easier than when I am not clear whether the gratification of mere desire is or is not lawful and beneficial.
('71', 191, 1, 12, 413520) If I am quite clear about the unlawfulness of the desire, I shall treat it as if it were a disease and repel its attacks with all my vigour.
('71', 191, 1, 13, 413661) I shall feel the stronger for the resistance.
('71', 191, 1, 14, 413707) They are wrong, even untruthful, who claim that they do not like the act but are helpless and therefore resistance leaves them weak and defeated.
('71', 191, 1, 15, 413853) If all such people were to examine themselves, they would discover that their thoughts deceive them.
('71', 191, 1, 16, 413954) Their thoughts cherish the desire and their speech is a false interpreter of their thoughts.
('71', 191, 1, 17, 414047) If on the other hand the speech is a true interpreter of the thoughts there can be no such thing as weakness.
('71', 191, 1, 18, 414157) Defeat there may be.
('71', 191, 1, 19, 414178) Weakness never.
('71', 191, 2, 20, 414194) The correspondents objection to procreation by unhealthy parents is perfectly valid.
('71', 191, 2, 21, 414279) They can have or should have no desire for progeny.
('71', 191, 2, 22, 414331) They are deceiving themselves and the world if they say that they perform the sexual act for progeny.
('71', 191, 2, 23, 414433) In an examination of any subject truthfulness is always assumed.
('71', 191, 2, 24, 414498) Desire for progeny must not be feigned in order to cover the pleasure of sexual union.

('71', 193, 2, 5, 416012) I have been travelling to inaccessible places, hence the delay in acknowledging your letter.
('71', 193, 2, 6, 416105) If you will forward the one lakh of rupees, I will forward the amounts to institutions that I may select.
('71', 193, 2, 7, 416211) Meantime, if the cheque for one lakh is received by me I shall bank it and send you proper receipts from the institutions concerned as the money is disbursed from time to time.

('71', 193, 6, 16, 416908) BHAI BHAGWANJI, I got both your letters only yesterday.
('71', 193, 6, 17, 416964) I returned from a tour of the villages yesterday and saw your letters.
('71', 193, 6, 18, 417035) You did very well indeed in writing to me but if I cannot make use of your letters, how can I solve the matter?
('71', 193, 6, 19, 417147) I advise you to call both Nanalal and Prabhashankar 1
('71', 193, 7, 20, 417201) and guide them properly, shedding all fear.
('71', 193, 7, 21, 417245) There was a time when Prabhashankar used to treat your advice as sacred word, and that lightened my burden, too.
('71', 193, 7, 22, 417358) Your letters throw a new light on the situation.
('71', 193, 7, 23, 417407) You should now put this business on the right lines as Ratilals lawyer, friend of the Mehta family and lover of justice.
('71', 193, 7, 24, 417528) I shall be able to do very little from here.
('71', 193, 7, 25, 417573) Think over this.
('71', 193, 7, 26, 417590) Ratilal and Champa 2 , both are completely under the influence of Prabhashankar.
('71', 193, 7, 27, 417671) They will do exactly as he desires.
('71', 193, 7, 28, 417707) To Ratilal he is in the place of a father.

('71', 194, 1, 4, 418092) If you are unable to do anything besides writing to me, then please permit me to make use of your letters or write to me a letter such as I can use.

('71', 194, 3, 8, 418432) 189. LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI
('71', 194, 4, 9, 418463) April 24, 1937
('71', 194, 5, 10, 418478) NARANDAS, I had got your letter.
('71', 194, 5, 11, 418511) I had a talk with Shankerlal 1 at Hudli about Jaisukhlal.
('71', 194, 5, 12, 418569) Shankerlal says that there is no connection between the charge against him and his being relieved.
('71', 194, 5, 13, 418668) But he is of the opinion that there is not sufficient work in Kathiawar to justify payment of Rs. 75 to Jaisukhlal and that his work would not be worth that much anywhere else either.
('71', 194, 5, 14, 418852) Jaisukhlal has not mastered the art of running a store, or of producing khadi, nor that of working in a spirit of co operation with others.
('71', 194, 5, 15, 418992) But he has no doubt at all regarding Jaisukhlals integrity.
('71', 194, 5, 16, 419052) If this statement of Shankerlal is correct, then no injustice is done to Jaisukhlal.
('71', 194, 5, 17, 419137) If you do not agree with Shankerlals explanation, then you may employ him in the work you are doing for the spread of khadi.
('71', 194, 5, 18, 419262) Take from him such work as will enable him to earn Rs. 75 or something more if he can.
('71', 194, 5, 19, 419349) You can do this and, if he has the ability to earn Rs. 75 through khadi work, may help him to develop in.
('71', 194, 5, 20, 419455) I myself am observing the extremely suspicious nature of Jaisukhlal and it has caused me much pain,.
('71', 194, 5, 21, 419556) He sees Chhaganlal Joshi at the back of all his misfortunes, while I myself have been able to see no such thing in any matter.
('71', 194, 5, 22, 419683) I know Chhaganlals merits and defects very well.
('71', 194, 5, 23, 419732) I have even lived with him.
('71', 194, 5, 24, 419760) I have seen in him no such failing that he would be after a man and do him ill just out of spite.
('71', 194, 5, 25, 419858) His opinions are very often baseless.
('71', 194, 5, 26, 419896) I also know that he lacks the capacity to cite evidence in support of his views.
('71', 194, 5, 27, 419977) I have not informed you till now and on inquiring I find that Kanaiyo also has not done so.
('71', 194, 5, 28, 420069) He was fairly ill during the Hudli trip.
('71', 194, 5, 29, 420110) Either from over exertion or for some other reason, he had got fever.

('71', 195, 0, 1, 420200) 196 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 195, 1, 2, 420242) He had got it as soon as we arrived there and it came down after four days.
('71', 195, 1, 3, 420318) But he did not suffer in the least.
('71', 195, 1, 4, 420354) The treatment also was the best possible.
('71', 195, 1, 5, 420396) It consisted in his drinking as much water as he couldhe took hot water with lime juice and salt, then he was put on water mixed with honey, and then he was given fruit and then milk.
('71', 195, 1, 6, 420580) He is still on milk and fruit.
('71', 195, 1, 7, 420611) He used to get good sleep.
('71', 195, 1, 8, 420638) It can practically be said that he did not require any nursing.
('71', 195, 1, 9, 420702) He was not given any special comfort apart from a cot.
('71', 195, 1, 10, 420757) He was given no privacy at all, nor was there any such facility.
('71', 195, 1, 11, 420822) Today he has come riding five miles on bicycle of his own free will.
('71', 195, 1, 12, 420891) There was no necessity for him to come for the sake of any work.
('71', 195, 1, 13, 420956) But once he feels well he cannot sit idle.
('71', 195, 1, 14, 420999) And I do not stop him from exerting himself within the limits of his strength.
('71', 195, 1, 15, 421078) The matter was not at all worth writing to you about.
('71', 195, 1, 16, 421132) There was no cause for worry.
('71', 195, 1, 17, 421162) We had an experienced doctor with us But even his help was not taken.
('71', 195, 1, 18, 421232) He did wish to give some medicine, but I emphatically forbade any medicine.
('71', 195, 1, 19, 421308) Kanaiyo also has great faith in fasting as of course I too have.
('71', 195, 1, 20, 421373) This time a special feature of my treatment was that I did not try enema at all.
('71', 195, 1, 21, 421454) It could have been given with some special arrangement, but he used to pass stools in the normal course.
('71', 195, 1, 22, 421559) I, therefore, did not insist on giving him enema.
('71', 195, 1, 23, 421609) He did not suffer in the least; no doubt it was thanks to his fast and also to the purity of his life.
('71', 195, 1, 24, 421712) At the time of giving away Manu and Nirmala, he had insisted on attending, and had joined in singing Vaishnava jana.
('71', 195, 1, 25, 421829) Kanti also arrived exactly on the day of kanyadan 1. Manu was therefore very happy, although she spared Kanti, having persuaded herself to be content with Kanus presence.
('71', 195, 1, 26, 422000) How is Kumis work going on?
('71', 195, 1, 27, 422028) If she gets her daughter admitted in the National School, exempt her from payment of fees.

('71', 197, 3, 4, 423619) April 25, 1937
('71', 197, 4, 5, 423634) Q. Do you think that there is a ny real anxiety on the part of the Britishers to
('71', 197, 5, 6, 423715) establish a contact between the Viceroy and the spokesman of the Indian National
('71', 197, 6, 7, 423796) Congress?
('71', 197, 7, 8, 423806) A. I do not think there is any.
('71', 197, 8, 9, 423838) Will you of your own accord seek an opportunity to meet the Viceroy?
('71', 197, 10, 10, 423907) Will you go if the initiative comes from the Viceroy?
('71', 197, 11, 11, 423961) I have no status.
('71', 197, 11, 12, 423979) The only party to be invited is the President of the Congress.
('71', 197, 12, 13, 424042) Will you be satisfied if the Viceroy gives you the necessary assurances and
('71', 197, 13, 14, 424118) asks you not to press for assurances from provincial Governors?
('71', 197, 14, 15, 424182) Do you not think that if the Congress does not accept office, the minority
('71', 197, 15, 16, 424257) Ministries will win over the electorate by their ameliorative measures?
('71', 197, 16, 17, 424329) I should not be surprised.

('71', 197, 18, 19, 424380) 1 The correspondent had reported: Mahatma Gandhi passed through Nagpur on Sunday, 25 4 1937, by the Grand Trunk Express.
('71', 197, 18, 20, 424501) He was accompanied by Mr. Mahadev Desai.
('71', 197, 18, 21, 424542) Huddled up in a third class crowded compartment sat the Mahatma, with files and books piled about him.
('71', 197, 18, 22, 424645) His secretartiat was with him and even in the train typing was being done.
('71', 197, 18, 23, 424720) One wonders if it was not a new formula for the Working Committee.
('71', 197, 18, 24, 424787) On the arrival of the train a set of questions was handed in to Mahatmaji to which he wrote his replies. 2 The reporter had explained: In view of his reply to the previous question Gandhiji gave no reply to this question. 3 In Interview to Associated Press of India, 26 4 1937, Gandhiji said that this answer was reported just the contrary to what I meant.

('71', 198, 2, 3, 425216) NAGPUR, [ April 25, 1937] 2
('71', 198, 3, 4, 425244) Q. Would you be satisfied with the assurance from the Governors on the lines given by Sir Samuel Hoare and quoted 3 by you?
('71', 198, 3, 5, 425368) A. I would be satisfied with the assurance with a definition of the word ordinarily which everybody can understand.
('71', 198, 4, 6, 425484) Will you kindly give me your own definition of the work ordinarily?
('71', 198, 4, 7, 425552) A. definition has really to come from those who want to introduce the adverb.
('71', 198, 4, 8, 425630) I have not introduced the word ordinarily in the Congress resolution 4 .
('71', 198, 4, 9, 425703) Congress meaning is quite clear.
('71', 198, 4, 10, 425736) For, it asked for an assurance in connection with a definite programme.
('71', 198, 4, 11, 425808) If that programme and everything similar to that programme is pursued by the Congress there should be no interference on the part of the Governor.
('71', 198, 4, 12, 425955) If in the opinion of the Governors the worst happens as Lord Lothian has suggested, the Governors can dismiss the Cabinet, dissolve the Assemblies and appeal to the electorate to find out whom the electorate will support.
('71', 198, 4, 13, 426177) If the Congress aim is to create deadlocks, what point is there is asking for any assurance from the Governors?
('71', 198, 4, 14, 426289) As I have already said and as I have read the Congress resolution, the aim of the Congress is not to create deadlocks,, but its aim undoubtedly is to make Congress position so irresistible as to replace the present Act, which nobody likes, by an Act which will represent the will of the masses.
('71', 198, 4, 15, 426584) This will be brought about by constitutional means permissible under the Act itself.
('71', 198, 4, 16, 426669) And if the Congress by force of its majority and by skill of Congress Ministers advances its own constitutional position to such a pitch that the British Ministers cannot possibly resist it except by force of arms, surely there can be nothing to grumble at.
('71', 198, 5, 17, 426927) You have said 4 that the Congress wanted non interference not non dismissal.
('71', 198, 5, 18, 427004) Will you please explain the difference between the two?
('71', 198, 5, 19, 427060) As a gentleman I cannot possibly ask for a promise that the Cabinet may never be dismissed.
('71', 198, 5, 20, 427152) But I can ask that there should be no

('71', 199, 1, 2, 427586) interference in the day to day administration.
('71', 199, 1, 3, 427633) I do not want the Cabinet to be in a position of having to resign on the slightest pretext; for honourable resignation there must be honourable cause that anybody could see.
('71', 199, 1, 4, 427807) If I have no assurance of non interference the Governor may submit his Ministers to pinpricks which they would feel but which may not give them understandable cause to take to the public in justifying resignation.
('71', 199, 1, 5, 428021) I would never put the Congress Cabinet in such embarrassing and humiliating position.
('71', 199, 1, 6, 428107) The same thing would apply to the Governors.
('71', 199, 1, 7, 428152) They would look incredibly foolish if on the slightest pretext they dismissed the Cabinet.
('71', 199, 1, 8, 428243) Therefore, if Governors are gentlemen and want to preserve the honour of the nation whom they represent they will think fifty times before dismissing the Cabinet.
('71', 199, 1, 9, 428406) I want to put them in that position so that there shall be no pinpricks from the Governors as all Ministers who worked under the Montford reforms have testified.
('71', 199, 1, 10, 428568) Their position was made unbearable and humiliating and yet they were unable to resign, perhaps they would not.

('71', 201, 3, 6, 431760) My answer was that I should be surprised if minority Ministries would win over the electorate by their ameliorative measures in case Congress did not accept office.
('71', 201, 3, 7, 431925) A slip of paper containing questions was handed to me through the crowd into the railway compartment which was none too empty.
('71', 201, 3, 8, 432052) I hurriedly wrote out the answer in pencil.
('71', 201, 3, 9, 432096) If the reporter maintains that I wrote the word not, I would very much like to see the original.

('71', 202, 13, 26, 433659) Questioned whether he still adhered to the view that if Governors gave assurance to the effect that ordinarily they would not interfere with constitutional activities of the Congress Ministers, the Congress would accept office, Gandhiji said,

('71', 203, 1, 2, 434129) in this matter his position should be properly understood.
('71', 203, 1, 3, 434188) Gandhiji did not think that mere addition of the word ordinarily to the formula would satisfy him or the Congress.
('71', 203, 1, 4, 434303) Such assurance would be acceptable to him only if the qualifying word was properly interpreted to our satisfaction.
('71', 203, 1, 5, 434419) Gandhiji further declared: We should know the meaning of ordinarily beforehand.
('71', 203, 2, 6, 434499) Our correspondent then drew Gandhijis attention to Prof.
('71', 203, 2, 7, 434556) Keiths 2 latest constitutional pronouncement published in todays Leader and asked him about the Congress position vis a vis Governors special powers.
('71', 203, 3, 8, 434706) Gandhiji smiled and said it was stale news and he had read it already in some paper yesterday.
('71', 203, 3, 9, 434801) As I read Professor Keiths statement I saw that he entirely endorsed the Congress position that the Congress does not seek any abrogation of the Act.
('71', 203, 4, 10, 434951) Asked whether it would not be unconstitutional for the Congress Ministry to attempt to trample over the legitimate rights of the minorities, Gandhiji declared that it would not only be unconstitutional but suicidal.

('71', 203, 5, 12, 435198) 202. HARIJANS ON BEGAR
('71', 203, 6, 13, 435221) The newspapers have given publicity to the threat of certain Harijans in certain villages to transfer their allegiance to the Christian Missions seeking to wean them from Hinduism under promise of better treatment, and especially freedom from begar 3 to which they are subjected by savarna Hindus.
('71', 203, 6, 14, 435519) It seems that representatives of the Hindu Mission and of the Harijan Sevak Sangh visited the aggrieved Harijans and got the savarna Hindus to promise better treatment.
('71', 203, 6, 15, 435688) The storm has abated for the time being.
('71', 203, 6, 16, 435729) I do not know what would have been the gain to the Missions concerned if the Harijans had gone over to their fold and how far the Harijans could have been claimed as bona fide converts.
('71', 203, 6, 17, 435915) This I know that such proselytizing efforts demoralize society, create suspicions and bitterness and retard the all round progress of society.
('71', 203, 6, 18, 436058) If, instead of wanting the so called conversion as the price of better treatment, Christian Missions co operated with Harijan sevaks in their effort to ease the burderns of Harijans, their help would be welcomed and the evolution of society would be hastened.
('71', 203, 6, 19, 436318) But I write this more to awaken savarna conscience than to

('71', 204, 0, 1, 436508) VOL.71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 205
('71', 204, 1, 2, 436551) criticize the Mission methods brought to light.
('71', 204, 1, 3, 436599) The system of forced labour exacted by petty land owners from Harijans and other classes called backward is almost universal in India.
('71', 204, 1, 4, 436734) The petty landlords are mostly Hindus.
('71', 204, 1, 5, 436773) Harijans and others can legally resist forced labour.
('71', 204, 1, 6, 436827) They are slowly but surely being awakened to a sense of their rights.
('71', 204, 1, 7, 436897) They are numerous enough to enforce them.
('71', 204, 1, 8, 436939) But all grace will be gone when savarna Hindus impotently resign themselves to their merited fate.
('71', 204, 1, 9, 437038) Better surely by far if they will recognize their duty of regarding Harijans as blood brothers, entitled to the respect that belongs to man and to receive due payment for services voluntarily performed.
('71', 204, 1, 10, 437241) It is the privilege of Harijan savaks, no matter to what organization they belong, to befriend Harijans to study their condition in detail, to approach savarna Hindus and show them as gently as possible what their duty is towards those whom they have treated as outcastes of society and deprived even of legal rights.
('71', 204, 1, 11, 437559) From the papers before me I further find that in Ode and some other villages in Gujarat the savarna Hindus take from Harijans who dispose of their dead cattle half the hide.
('71', 204, 1, 12, 437733) This is unlike the usual practice of allowing the Harijans to own the dead cattle they remove.
('71', 204, 1, 13, 437828) In some cases Harijans not only retain the dead cattle they remove, but receive a payment for the labour of removing carcasses.
('71', 204, 1, 14, 437956) The matter demands more investigation and fair adjustment.
('71', 204, 1, 15, 438015) If Harijans were better treated and if savarna Hindus had no horror of dead cattle and had no superstitious laws of pollution, they would learn the art of flaying the dead cattle and turning every part of the carcasses into wealth, both to the benefit of themselves and the Harijans whom they may invite to help them in the process of disposing of their dead cattle.

('71', 204, 2, 18, 438537) The terms were also given.
('71', 204, 2, 19, 438564) The time for sending the essays having elapsed, the Board of Examiners entered upon their task and have reported that none of the essays fulfil the conditions laid down.
('71', 204, 2, 20, 438734) The following is their report 1 .
('71', 204, 2, 21, 438768) The prize has not been withdrawn by the donor.
('71', 204, 2, 22, 438815) The examiners, Prof.

('71', 205, 1, 2, 438996) Kumarappa, have kindly signified their readiness to examine any further essays that may be sent.
('71', 205, 1, 3, 439093) I would, however, advise competitors, if any are willing, to strictly conform to the requirements laid down by the examiners.
('71', 205, 1, 4, 439219) It is clear from their note and it is but natural that no essay will pass muster unless it reaches the level expected by them, and none will reach that level unless writers are industrious enough to study the necessary literature on the subject and build on their study an original thesis.
('71', 205, 1, 5, 439509) It may be that the prize is not sufficiently tempting for such an effort.
('71', 205, 1, 6, 439583) If that is so, I can only say that those who write for the mere monetary value of prizes hardly ever realize the expectations of donors.
('71', 205, 1, 7, 439720) Without love of subject itself, high merit is not to be expected in difficult competitions like the one about the system of barter.
('71', 205, 1, 8, 439852) The time for handing in the essays is fixed as 31st December, 1937. All essays should be addressed to Prof.
('71', 205, 1, 9, 439960) J.C. Kumarappa, Maganwadi, Wardha.
('71', 205, 1, 10, 439995) No further extension of time will be given, and if no effort succeeds the prize will be finally withdrawn.

('71', 205, 3, 13, 440142) A friend writes: 2
('71', 205, 4, 14, 440161) About two and a half years ago this city was convulesd by a social tragedy.
('71', 205, 4, 15, 440237) A Vaishya gentleman had a sixteen year old daughter.
('71', 205, 4, 16, 440290) She had a maternal uncle aged twenty one years studying in college in the same city.
('71', 205, 4, 17, 440375) The two fell secretly in love with each other.
('71', 205, 4, 18, 440422) The girl is said to have become pregnant.
('71', 205, 4, 19, 440464) When the true state of affairs at last became known, the lovers committed suicide by taking poison.
('71', 205, 4, 20, 440564) The girl died immediately but the boy died a couple of days afterwards in the hospital .
('71', 205, 4, 21, 440653) At the time when the storm was at its height and nobody had a kind word to say about the deceased unfortunate lovers, I shocked everybody by expressing my opinion that under the afore mentioned circumstances the young lovers ought to have been allowed to have their way.
('71', 205, 4, 22, 440924) But mine remained a voice in the wilderness.
('71', 205, 4, 23, 440969) What is your opinion in the matter?
('71', 205, 4, 24, 441005) I have deliberately kept back the name of the correspondent and the place at the request of the writer as he did not want old sores to be reoponded by a revival of an old controversy.
('71', 205, 4, 25, 441189) All the same I feel that a public discussion of this delicate topic is necessary.
('71', 205, 4, 26, 441271) In my opinion such marriages as are interdicted in a particulars society cannot be recongnized all at once or at the will of an individual.
('71', 205, 4, 27, 441411) Nor has society

('71', 206, 1, 2, 441617) or relatives of parties concerned any right to impose their will upon and forcibly curtail the liberty of action of the young people who may want to contract such marriages.
('71', 206, 1, 3, 441791) In the instance cited by the correspondent both the parties had fully attained maturity.
('71', 206, 1, 4, 441880) They could well think for themselves.
('71', 206, 1, 5, 441918) No one had a right forcibly to prevent them from marrying each other if they wanted to.
('71', 206, 1, 6, 442006) Society could at the most refuse to recognize the marriage, but it was the height of tyranny to drive them to suicide.
('71', 206, 1, 7, 442125) Marriage taboos are not universal and are largely based on social usage.
('71', 206, 2, 8, 442198) These alliances are not taboo in every society.
('71', 206, 2, 9, 442246) The Christian, Muslim, Parsi and other communities do not observe this taboo.
('71', 206, 2, 10, 442324) It is not even taboo in all Hindu varnas.
('71', 206, 2, 11, 442366) The same varna has different customs in different Provinces.
('71', 206, 2, 12, 442427) Among the so called high caste Brahmins of the South, such alliances are not only not tabooed, but on the contrary are considered commendable.
('71', 206, 3, 13, 442570) The usage varies from Province to Province and as between different divisions.
('71', 206, 3, 14, 442649) This does not mean that the youth may ride roughshod over all established social customs and inhibitions.
('71', 206, 3, 15, 442755) Before they decide to do so, they must convert public opinion to their side.
('71', 206, 3, 16, 442832) In the meantime, the individuals concerned ought patiently to bide their time, or, if they cannot do that calmly and quietly, to face the consequences of social ostracism.
('71', 206, 3, 17, 443004) At the same time it is equally the duty of society not to take up a heartless, step motherly attitude towards those who might disregard or break the established conventions.
('71', 206, 3, 18, 443178) In the instance described by my correspondent the guilt of driving the young couple to suicide certainly rests on the shoulders of society if the version that is before me in correct.

('71', 207, 6, 14, 444429) Shri Narahari Parikh, Secretary of the Goseva Sangh, has sent me a brief description of his tour in some Kathiawar States which he undertook for examining the cattle wealth there.
('71', 207, 6, 15, 444609) I hope to publish it in Harijanbandhu, in two instalments.
('71', 207, 6, 16, 444668) The following [item in this issue] is the first of these.
('71', 207, 6, 17, 444726) 1 There was a time when Kathiawar cows were highly praised.
('71', 207, 6, 18, 444786) That variety still exists but it is gradually disappearing.
('71', 207, 6, 19, 444846) This wealth, which is being destroyed, may still be saved and fresh additions made to it if the rulers of Kathiawar and their officials put in the effort.
('71', 207, 6, 20, 445001) There is room for improvement in all industries.
('71', 207, 6, 21, 445050) Each one of these could be made more paying.
('71', 207, 6, 22, 445095) But this possibility is perhaps the greatest in animal husbandry.
('71', 207, 6, 23, 445161) Knowledge, diligence and patience are all that is required.
('71', 207, 6, 24, 445221) According to our present knowledge, it is even claimed that the health of the human race is especially dependent upon our cattle wealth, i.e., on cows milk.
('71', 207, 6, 25, 445378) India is a country where one expects the cows to be of the highest quality.
('71', 207, 6, 26, 445454) But they are of the poorest quality and are at present a burden on the land.
('71', 207, 6, 27, 445531) Shri Purushottam Joshi of the Bhavnagar institution, who is an expert in animal husbandry, suggests the following three ways of looking after cows: 1. Vagrant bulls should be castrated and used as bullocks.
('71', 207, 6, 28, 445738) 2. Good pedigree bulls should be kept in every village and these should be well cared for.
('71', 207, 6, 29, 445829) 3. Every farmer should have his own cow.
('71', 207, 7, 30, 445870) 1 The articles,which appeared under the title Cow protection in Kathiawar, are not translated here.

('71', 208, 4, 7, 446314) MY DEAR IDIOT, Your letter awaited me yesterday when I reached Wardha.
('71', 208, 4, 8, 446385) Allahabad was a taxing time.
('71', 208, 4, 9, 446414) There was no wrangling.
('71', 208, 4, 10, 446438) But the discussions in which I had to engage was a strain.
('71', 208, 4, 11, 446497) The heat was terrible.
('71', 208, 4, 12, 446520) The nights on the terrace delightful.
('71', 208, 4, 13, 446558) Jawaharlal was pale and weak.
('71', 208, 4, 14, 446588) He must have sailed for Burma by now.
('71', 208, 4, 15, 446626) The trip will do him good.
('71', 208, 4, 16, 446653) I have asked him to take no less than a month.
('71', 208, 4, 17, 446700) After it he, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and I are to meet for a few days.
('71', 208, 4, 18, 446771) You should write to Prabhavati, if you have not already.
('71', 208, 4, 19, 446828) Her address is: C/o Brij Kishore Prasad, Srinagar, Sewan, Bihar.
('71', 208, 4, 20, 446893) The heat is growing here.
('71', 208, 4, 21, 446919) It is not trying for me.
('71', 208, 4, 22, 446944) But I have to go to Gujarat for 20 days to fix up Gujarat Affairs.

('71', 208, 4, 27, 447169) I could not get anything to give to Manu on your behalf.
('71', 208, 4, 28, 447226) So you have to think of something inexpensive and useful.

('71', 209, 6, 10, 447668) PRABHA, I was eagerly waiting for your letter.
('71', 209, 6, 11, 447715) I found two letters yesterday on returning from Allahabad.
('71', 209, 6, 12, 447774) If you dont write your address and as a result dont receive my letters, is it my fault?
('71', 209, 6, 13, 447862) I had written to you at Patna C/o The Searchlight since I had forgotten your residential address there.
('71', 209, 6, 14, 447966) Thereafter I went to Allahabad.
('71', 209, 6, 15, 447998) I waited for your letter but didnt get any.
('71', 209, 6, 16, 448042) And I also thought I would write to you after returning to Wardha.
('71', 209, 6, 17, 448109) Now, tell me, who is to blame for this?
('71', 209, 6, 18, 448149) Certainly not you, but am I to blame, either?
('71', 209, 6, 19, 448195) Please remember this, that you should give your complete address in every letter.
('71', 209, 6, 20, 448277) I have already given you Rajkumaris address.
('71', 209, 6, 21, 448322) Here it is again: Shri Rajkumari Amrit Kaur, Manorville, Simla.
('71', 209, 6, 22, 448386) As Jawaharlal was not well, the meeting was arranged at Allahabad.
('71', 209, 6, 23, 448453) I would have been happy if you could have come there.
('71', 209, 6, 24, 448507) How is your health?
('71', 209, 6, 25, 448527) Is the pressure of work heavy?
('71', 209, 6, 26, 448558) What do you eat?
('71', 209, 6, 27, 448575) Vasumati is here.

('71', 210, 3, 4, 449001) BHAI GHANSHYAMDAS, Regarding the mill affairs, ethics demand that the labourers should be told that unless they behave properly the mill will remain closed and no new recruits wil be made.
('71', 210, 3, 5, 449190) You can work with fresh labour only when the old lot vacate the quarters without giving trouble.
('71', 210, 3, 6, 449287) I think this way is not only ethical but also economic.
('71', 210, 3, 7, 449343) Do question further if this does not cover the whole problem.

('71', 210, 9, 16, 449757) The nights are cool.
('71', 210, 9, 17, 449778) I quite agree with you that Lionel 1 should give up the present job and do what he can in England.
('71', 210, 9, 18, 449877) I wish you could persuade him to give up the job and go back to England.
('71', 210, 9, 19, 449950) Shummy 2 is right about his fear of infection.
('71', 210, 9, 20, 449997) You may not expose your dear ones to risks which they and their parents will not willingly run.
('71', 210, 9, 21, 450093) I am glad you have resumed Sanskrit study.
('71', 210, 9, 22, 450136) You wont give up Hindi on any account.

('71', 211, 5, 9, 450933) Wherever you take me, you will have to look after a big crowd.
('71', 211, 5, 10, 450996) I wont be able to dissuade anybody from joining.
('71', 211, 5, 11, 451045) I personally dont mind, but we must consider the convenience of the owner 1 of the bungalow in which we are lodged.
('71', 211, 5, 12, 451161) Mirabehn has already served notice.

('71', 213, 3, 4, 453705) KANTI, I have your letter.
('71', 213, 3, 5, 453732) Your programme is good.
('71', 213, 3, 6, 453756) The earlier you reach Bangalore, the better will it be from the point of view of the weather.
('71', 213, 3, 7, 453850) It is good that you learnt from Bali the history about your mother.
('71', 213, 3, 8, 453918) It is not an ordinary history.
('71', 213, 3, 9, 453949) And Chanchi was the most modest among all the sisters.
('71', 213, 3, 10, 454004) She had the strength to live creditably in any condition.
('71', 213, 3, 11, 454062) I wrote to Amtul Salaam only two days ago and told her that she might by all means stay in her town.
('71', 213, 3, 12, 454163) I doubted whether she would be happy there.
('71', 213, 3, 13, 454207) But I see that she will experience no difficulty in staying anywhere there because of her fathers influence.
('71', 213, 3, 14, 454316) Moreover I learnt an extraordinary thing about her that she rides.
('71', 213, 3, 15, 454383) But since I have permitted her she might not stay.
('71', 213, 3, 16, 454434) Let us now see what she does.

('71', 213, 3, 21, 454662) The letter was opened through oversight.
('71', 213, 3, 22, 454703) I could not understand who this Khan 2
('71', 213, 4, 23, 454742) After that I saw Paparammas signature and understood.

('71', 213, 4, 26, 454942) Perhaps it might have been demolished by now.

('71', 214, 3, 4, 455460) BHAI BENARSIDAS, The purpose of the tour of Mauritius, etc., is quite different from the purpose behind the tour of Sumatra and other countries.
('71', 214, 3, 5, 455605) Burma, Sumatra, Java, Siam, etc., have some connection with Eastern culture and it seems natural enough for them to have links with Indian languages.
('71', 214, 3, 6, 455755) It does not of course imply that they will all learn Hindi, yet one need not be surprised if some of them do study it.

('71', 214, 8, 12, 456117) I know that Agatha Harrison has been keeping you in touch with things as they are shaping here.
('71', 214, 8, 13, 456213) 1 Everything that is possible to bring about peace is being done but it is not an easy job.
('71', 214, 8, 14, 456305) My special contribution, therefore, is negative.
('71', 214, 8, 15, 456354) The Congress leaders have, in my opinion, been acting with the greatest restraint in the face of grave provocation.
('71', 214, 8, 16, 456470) I should have no hesitation in seeking an interview with Lord Linlithgow under ordinary circumstances but at the present juncture, if I made any such attempt, it would be wrong.
('71', 214, 8, 17, 456648) For, the right person to interview the Viceroy is naturally Jawaharlal Nehru.
('71', 214, 8, 18, 456726) But he has no faith whatsoever in seeking such interviews because he thinks that nothing good can come out of them.

('71', 216, 5, 14, 459197) I had already written a letter to you before you could demand one.
('71', 216, 5, 15, 459264) Just then I got the letter informing me that both of you were coming here.
('71', 216, 5, 16, 459339) I, therefore, kept back my letter.
('71', 216, 5, 17, 459374) Now you have cancelled your coming here altogether.

('71', 217, 7, 9, 460319) BHAI SATYANARAYANA, I have shown your scheme to Anna also.
('71', 217, 7, 10, 460378) His views are enclosed.
('71', 217, 7, 11, 460402) What you have written about Punjabi in the first paragraph does not seem to be correct.
('71', 217, 7, 12, 460490) For, if Punjabi is quite similar to Hindi, are not Bengali, Oriya, Assamese and Sindhi also very much like Hindi?
('71', 217, 7, 13, 460604) But at the same time it can be said that Hindustani and Urdu are also as much in use as Punjabi in the Punjab.
('71', 217, 7, 14, 460715) So whatever work is to be done there should be carried on only through local people.
('71', 217, 7, 15, 460800) It is for this reason that just as no activity is carried on by the Hindi Prachar Samiti in the United Provinces, there should be none in the Punjab also.
('71', 217, 7, 16, 460955) You must keep in mind that we do not propagate Hindi where Urdu is spoken.
('71', 217, 7, 17, 461030) We consider Urdu speaking people as Hindi speaking ones.
('71', 217, 7, 18, 461087) As for the rest of the scheme my view is that all the activities should be self sufficient.
('71', 217, 7, 19, 461179) Let me give you one more idea.
('71', 217, 7, 20, 461210) I am of the opinion that we have attempted nothing original in our method of teaching, i.e., we have hardly made any efforts for making the learning of Hindi easy and interesting as has been done in the case of English.
('71', 217, 7, 21, 461430) Who amongst us can tell how many days it takes to teach Hindi, or in how many days the script may be taught?
('71', 217, 7, 22, 461539) We have not evolved a model self teaching primer in any of the Indian languages.
('71', 217, 7, 23, 461620) Some little effort has been made in Tamil, etc., but I see nothing original, nothing extraordinary in it.
('71', 217, 7, 24, 461726) If we can do something on these lines the spread

('71', 218, 1, 3, 461924) We do have a good many teachers in the South because of the Dakshin Bharat [Hindi] Prachar [Sabha] but do we have someone who can take up this kind of task?

('71', 218, 5, 10, 462336) WARDHA, May 6, 1937
('71', 218, 6, 11, 462356) Q. I take it that you had much to do with the latest resolution 1 of the Working
('71', 218, 7, 12, 462437) Committee on office acceptance.
('71', 218, 7, 13, 462469) If so, is there any truth in the suggestion that you
('71', 218, 8, 14, 462522) have yielded to the left wingers?
('71', 218, 8, 15, 462556) A. As a matter of fact there were no left wingers and right wingers this time.
('71', 218, 8, 16, 462635) The only question discussed was about the form the resolution had to take.
('71', 218, 9, 17, 462710) Do you not see that there is very little difference between Mr. Butlers 2
('71', 218, 10, 18, 462784) statement and the Working Committees resolution?
('71', 218, 10, 19, 462833) If that is so, why is there the slightest difficulty about Mr. Butlers instructing the Governors to offer office to the Congress leaders in terms of the Congress Resolution?
('71', 218, 11, 20, 463007) 1 Passed at Allahabad on April 28, which read: :The past record of the British Government as well as its present attitude show that without the specific assurances as required by the Congress, popular Ministers will be unable to function properly and without irritating interference.
('71', 218, 11, 21, 463291) The assurances do not contemplate abrogation of the right of the Governor to dismiss the Ministry or dissolve the provincial Assembly when serious differences of opinion arise between the Governor and his Ministers.
('71', 218, 11, 22, 463507) But this Committee has grave objection to Ministers having to submit to interference by the Governor with the alternative of themselves having to resign their office instead of the Governors taking the responsibility of dismissing them. 2 Under Secretary of State for India; addressing the House of Commons on April 26, he said: His Majestys Government have no intention of countenancing the use of special powers for purposes other than those for which Parliament intended them.
('71', 218, 11, 23, 463987) It is certainly not their intention that the Governors, by a narrow or legalistic interpretation of their own responsibilities should trench upon the wide powers which it was the purpose of Parliament to place in the hands of Ministers and which it is desired they should use in furtherance of the programmes they have advocated.
('71', 219, 0, 1, 464317) 220 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 219, 1, 2, 464359) Leaving Lord Zetlands speech 1 aside for the moment, what is the discourtesy you detect in Mr. Butlers statement?
('71', 219, 1, 3, 464473) I have never known a great party, commanding a majority that the Congress does, having such a thing as office thrown at it, and its leaders treated as if they were petitioners.
('71', 219, 1, 4, 464650) If they were Ministers would they have to send applications to the Governors for interviews and run the risk of their applications being summarily rejected?
('71', 219, 1, 5, 464807) I had thought that in autonomy the Ministers got the audience of their Governors for the asking and often the Governors had to give in to the Ministers where the latter had felt displeased or offended.
('71', 219, 1, 6, 465009) The British Government know that the Congress is out for complete independence.
('71', 219, 1, 7, 465089) It seems to me that the British Cabinet resent this attitude of Congress.
('71', 219, 1, 8, 465163) If so, they should plainly tell the Congress and the world that they will not tolerate complete independence and should cease to play with the word autonomy.
('71', 219, 1, 9, 465321) If on the other hand they do not mind natural evolution of India to its destiny, whatever it may be, they must treat the Congress with the consideration its position demands and disarm suspicion that, owing to their speech and action, is deepening.

('71', 219, 4, 14, 465761) But I fear it is no contribution to the removal of the deadlock.
('71', 219, 4, 15, 465826) The last resolution of the Working Committee is the clearest possible annotation of the All India Congress Committees resolution, in accordance with which assurances were asked for.
('71', 219, 4, 16, 466008) Now the world knows what was meant.
('71', 219, 4, 17, 466044) Surely, it is no strain upon the Constitution Act for the Governors to give the assurance that whenever a situation
('71', 219, 5, 18, 466160) 1 Of April 8, in reply to Lord Lothian, it read: The demand made of the Governors was one which without amendment of the Constitution they could not possibly accept .
('71', 219, 5, 19, 466327) I would add that even if the Constitution admitted a pledge of this kind being given , the giving of it would have involved a grave breach of faith with 2 The giving of it would have involved a grave breach of faith with the minorities and others in India .
('71', 219, 5, 20, 466585) Opinions might differ as to the extent and necessity for such safeguards but it could not be doubted that the minorities in India themselves attached the utmost importance to them. 3 The interview was on Lord Zetlands address to the House of Lords on May 6; vide Appendix Lord Zetlands Speech, 6 5 1937. 4 ibid

('71', 220, 1, 3, 467171) Citing the performances of Minstries formed by Governors in the face of universal opposition does not improve matters but strengthens suspicion.
('71', 220, 1, 4, 467316) In my opinion, the Congress is in earnest and wants to make a serious effort, if it takes office to make a substantial advance by that method towards its unequivocal goal of complete independence in so far as it is constitutionally possible to make that advance.

('71', 221, 1, 2, 469309) 226. COCHIN TRAVANCORE
('71', 221, 2, 3, 469332) My worst fears have come true and Cochin and Travancore are at war with each other.
('71', 221, 2, 4, 469416) The pity of it is that the war is over a matter of vital interest to Hinduism and therefore to the whole of India.
('71', 221, 2, 5, 469531) It is a war between light and darkness.
('71', 221, 2, 6, 469571) I am loath to think that the population of Cochin is behind the Cochin Maharajas action.
('71', 221, 2, 7, 469660) He may regulate worship in the Cochin temples under his jurisdiction in any manner he likes.
('71', 221, 2, 8, 469753) But even the most orthodox Hinduism would hardly permit him to regulate the private conduct of the visitors to the Cochin temples.
('71', 221, 2, 9, 469884) In no temple in India where Harijans are not permitted to worship are trustees authorized to scrutinize the actions of savarna Hindus who are entitled as a matter of right to visit the temples.
('71', 221, 2, 10, 470078) In Cochin the Maharaja has interfered in respect of a temple 1
('71', 221, 3, 11, 470141) over which he has no exclusive control.
('71', 221, 3, 12, 470181) The Maharaja of Travancore, too, possesses substantial right over the temples in question.
('71', 221, 3, 13, 470272) The Cochin order is clearly an interference with that right.
('71', 221, 3, 14, 470333) If Travancore has sinned, it is no concern of Cochin.
('71', 221, 3, 15, 470387) The Cochin order is an interference with the right of private judgment.
('71', 221, 3, 16, 470459) In this crisis the duty of the public seems to me to be clear.
('71', 221, 3, 17, 470522) Meetings should be held all over the country condemning the Cochin orders and asking for their withdrawal.
('71', 221, 3, 18, 470629) The most orthodox Hindus can surely join such protest meetings even though they may not be in favour of throwing open all temples to Harijans.
('71', 221, 3, 19, 470772) Seeing that the Cochin public is directly interested in the action of its Maharaja, they may lead the agitation.
('71', 221, 3, 20, 470885) The pundits of India should dispassionately examine the orders and express their unbiased opinion.
('71', 221, 3, 21, 470984) I am inclined to think that the Travancore Durbar may well invite the opinion of pundits on the single question of the religious propriety of the Cochin order and undertake to abide by their opinion.
('71', 221, 3, 22, 471184) In other words, Travancore may well offer to abide by the verdict of an arbitration tribunal consisting of unbiased pundits who will be universally accepted as such.
('71', 221, 3, 23, 471350) The opinion of an assembly of such pundits would be the nearest approach to an arbitration tribunal.
('71', 221, 3, 24, 471451) For, whilst the

('71', 222, 1, 2, 471693) Travancore Durbar had a perfect right to open to Harijans the temples within their sole jurisdiction and ownership and without reference to the opinion of pundits, it would hardly be right to propound a new Smriti in respect of temples where there is joint jurisdiction.
('71', 222, 1, 3, 471964) The Harijan cause must be always and everywhere above suspicion.
('71', 222, 1, 4, 472029) Travancores glorious action is capable of standing meticulous scrutiny on the ground of moral correctness.

('71', 222, 3, 7, 472187) Since the foregoing 1 was written the following was received from Shri C.K. Parameswaran Pillai, President, Kerala Harijan Sevak Sangh...
('71', 222, 4, 8, 472325) In a letter to The Madras Mail from somebody from Ernakulam, dated the 20th April, 1937, it is stated that considerable resentment is felt here at the criticisms in Travancore of the Cochin Governments order regarding the Koodalmanikkam Temple at Irinjalakuda, and the vast majority of the Hindus in the State support the Governments action....
('71', 222, 4, 9, 472670) Again on the 23rd April The Madras Mails own correspondent wrote to that paper that leading citizens of Irinjalakuda support the Cochin Governments declaration that the temple was defiled by the participation in its ceremonies of tantris who had officiated in temples to which avarnas were admitted....
('71', 222, 5, 10, 472973) The Cochin Legislative Council has been passing resolutions year after year recommending to Government the abolition of untouchability.
('71', 222, 5, 11, 473109) Resoutions were also passed at public meetings on several occasions in support of temple entry for Harijans.
('71', 222, 5, 12, 473218) Having reasons, therefore, to doubt therefore, to doubt the correctness of the statement in The Madras Mail, I went
('71', 222, 6, 13, 473334) to Ernakulam on the 25th April accompanied by Sjt.
('71', 222, 6, 14, 473385) M. Govindan, B.A.,B.L., retired Judge and the President of the Trivandrum District Committee of the Harijan Sevak Sangh, to study the real situation of affairs in Cochin.
('71', 222, 6, 15, 473556) I interviewed several important persons including the Thachudaya Kaimal, the administrator of the Koodalmanikkam Temple, and the Prisendent of the S.N.D.P. Yogam.
('71', 222, 6, 16, 473719) I am now in a position, to say difinitely that there is no foundation for the statement in The Madras Mail that the majority of the
('71', 222, 7, 17, 473851) people of Cochin support the action of the Cochin Government in excommunicating the tantris.
('71', 222, 7, 18, 473944) The Hindu of the 23rd April has published two

('71', 223, 1, 3, 474231) denouncing in unmistakable terms the action taken by the Cochin Government against the Nedumpally Nambudiri the tantri
('71', 223, 2, 4, 474350) concerned...
('71', 223, 2, 5, 474363) From the social and moral standpoint the action of the Cochin Government is unjustifiable and inconsistent.
('71', 223, 2, 6, 474471) The dharmashastras clearly lay down that anybody who takes a sea voyageeven a person who remains in the sea for three consecutive daysbecomes a patita.
('71', 223, 2, 7, 474623) It was for this reason that Professor (now Sir) Ramunny Menon was ostracized by the Cochin Government and prohibited from entering into Cochin temples.
('71', 223, 2, 8, 474775) A few years later when the Cochin Maharajas son returned from England after his education, the rule was abrogated and admission was given to all England returned men to temples.
('71', 223, 2, 9, 474953) The Cochin temples became polluted then, and the Travancore Government might have taken such steps against the Nedumpally Nambudiripad at that time which the Cochin Government have now taken.
('71', 223, 2, 10, 475145) If in fact we apply strictly the rules of the dharmashastras to the present day, the savarna Hindus will all have to be treated as patitas and they cannot enter the temples there.
('71', 223, 2, 11, 475325) But in these progressive days no reasonable Government will think of doing such an unreasonable thing.
('71', 223, 2, 12, 475428) I hope, therefore, that the Cochin Government will reconsider their order and withdraw the same.
('71', 223, 2, 13, 475525) The Dewan, Sir R. K. Shanmukham Chetty, is a cultured man of modern views and a supporter of the Justice Party.
('71', 223, 2, 14, 475637) I have no doubt that he will do what is proper and restore public confidence in his administration.

('71', 223, 5, 18, 475903) The first letter referred to in the foregoing was inadvertently destroyed.
('71', 223, 5, 19, 475978) Happily the reader has the gist of it in this.
('71', 223, 5, 20, 476025) Shri Hara Dayal Nag says, truly, that if the temple untouchability is not destroyed, the temples have to be; and if temples go, with them must disappear Hinduism as we know it.

('71', 224, 3, 4, 476374) MY DEAR REBEL, This is being written on paper prepared by Prabhu Dayal.
('71', 224, 3, 5, 476446) He has brought a fair lot of paper and has been showing it to me with great pride.
('71', 224, 3, 6, 476529) I thought therefore that I should let you see his handiwork.
('71', 224, 3, 7, 476590) This is not the best specimen but it was a convenient size for me to cut.
('71', 224, 3, 8, 476664) Well, normal men are just as good and as bad as normal women.
('71', 224, 3, 9, 476726) You have been known to have behaved just as badly as if not worse than Lionel.
('71', 224, 3, 10, 476805) And I see from your letter to Mira that you do not give me any news about your health thus leaving me to infer that you are keeping quite well.
('71', 224, 3, 11, 476949) But now I understand you are not keeping extra well.
('71', 224, 3, 12, 477002) Why should I not know all this?
('71', 224, 3, 13, 477034) And you have been taking medicines too!
('71', 224, 3, 14, 477074) You must let me know accurately what the matter is with you.
('71', 224, 3, 15, 477135) Balkrishna 1 is just as you left him.
('71', 224, 3, 16, 477173) I thought I had told you as much.
('71', 224, 3, 17, 477207) I am glad you are giving so much time to Sanskrit.
('71', 224, 3, 18, 477258) Your Hindi writing is a trifle too large but you are erring on the safe side; when the hand has settled you will soon begin to write the natural size.
('71', 224, 3, 19, 477409) I have not had a bill from Mehta.
('71', 224, 3, 20, 477443) He was given the full address.
('71', 224, 3, 21, 477474) But an evil fate hangs about your address which no one but I would write correctly.
('71', 224, 3, 22, 477558) I hope you had to pay nothing extra.
('71', 224, 3, 23, 477595) I hope it will be of use.
('71', 224, 3, 24, 477621) You should write to Dinsha Mehta to send you the bill for the kettle.

('71', 225, 6, 13, 478375) If it is a fact, tell me in detail how far you have progressed during this period.

('71', 225, 9, 21, 478882) Kumri is a small village, about seventeen miles from Belgaum.
('71', 225, 9, 22, 478944) Shri Gangadharrao has built an ashram there.
('71', 225, 9, 23, 478989) The annual meeting of the Gandhi Seva Sangh was to have been held in Hudli but the rain god intervened and the members of the Sangh ran from the pandal and took shelter under the roof of the weaving school of the Kumri

('71', 226, 0, 1, 479239) VOL.71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1935 227
('71', 226, 1, 2, 479282) Ashram.
('71', 226, 1, 3, 479290) After a great deal of discussion, some important resolutions were passed there, of which the following are the most noteworthy.
('71', 226, 1, 4, 479418) I give these 1 in the original Hindi language.
('71', 226, 1, 5, 479465) The Hindi is so simple that no reader will need a translation.
('71', 226, 1, 6, 479528) Despite this, if anyone fails to understand them, he should get them translated by someone who knows Hindi.
('71', 226, 1, 7, 479636) As regards the first [three] resoultions, it would be sufficient to say that the changes made have been introduced with a view to the expansion of constructive work.
('71', 226, 1, 8, 479802) These are not made as alternatives or additions to constructive work.
('71', 226, 1, 9, 479872) The object of the permission 2 is merely to assist it.
('71', 226, 1, 10, 479927) If this objective is not clearly understood, the fears of Shri Kishorelal may perhaps prove true.
('71', 226, 1, 11, 480025) The Sangh exists for the very purpose of keeping constructive work alive, for making it interesting and for spreading it from Kashmir to Cape Comorin and from Karachi to Dibrugarh.
('71', 226, 1, 12, 480206) This is because constructive work has been regarded as the mark of truth and non violence.
('71', 226, 1, 13, 480297) For its success contact has to be established with three crores of voters.
('71', 226, 1, 14, 480372) In order to make this contact effective, if some members of the Gandhi Seva Sangh have to enter Legislatures, it becomes a clear duty of the Sangh to make provision for it.
('71', 226, 1, 15, 480545) The fourth resolution is almost self evident.
('71', 226, 1, 16, 480591) No matter how many wells and ponds are added, they will prove useful.
('71', 226, 1, 17, 480661) They increase the countrys wealth and, moreover, wells, ponds and such otherwater reservouirs constructed by the Sangh, will of course be open to all Harijans.
('71', 226, 1, 18, 480821) Hence if these are built at appropriate sites, they will provide water to innumerable thirsty Harijans and the donors as well as the Sangh will earn the blessings of the beneficiaries.
('71', 226, 1, 19, 481006) Hence, those who wish to do so should send contributions, without a second thought, to the Sangh for the purpose of digging wells for Harijans.
('71', 226, 1, 20, 481150) The fifth resolution is an all embracing one.
('71', 226, 1, 21, 481196) The assumption behind it is that village welfare work begins with the service of Bhangis, i.e., with village sanitation.
('71', 226, 1, 22, 481317) How this can be done is explained in the resolution.
('71', 226, 1, 23, 481370) It is worth noting that the task of providing medicines and running schools has not been considered essential.
('71', 226, 1, 24, 481481) There is no mention in the resolution of spinning and such other crafts.
('71', 226, 1, 25, 481554) The implication is that these things will have to be done, but the
('71', 226, 2, 26, 481621) 1 Not translated here.
('71', 226, 2, 27, 481644) The resolution dealt with the constructive programme through charkha, wells for drinking water, use and propagation of Hindi, eradication of untouchability, and cow protection.

('71', 227, 0, 1, 482002) 228 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 227, 1, 2, 482044) stress is laid on what one has to start with.
('71', 227, 1, 3, 482090) This is because the aim of the resolution is to remove the fear entertained by some members of being boycotted while doing the work of sanitation.
('71', 227, 1, 4, 482237) In the sixth resolution the propagation of Hindi has been advocated and the methods indicated.
('71', 227, 1, 5, 482332) As long as leaders feel it infra dig to appear for an examination in Hindi, others will not be very enthusiastic about it.
('71', 227, 1, 6, 482455) So long as public institutions do not carry on their business in Hindi or so long as Hindi translations are not made available where the use of English is found indispensable, Hindi cannot be propagated on a large scale.
('71', 227, 1, 7, 482676) Here Hindi includes Hindustani.
('71', 227, 1, 8, 482708) There is no distinction between the two from the point of view of the Sangh.
('71', 227, 1, 9, 482785) The Sangh has through the seventh resolution demonstrated its zeal for national education, but the national Vidyapiths have been entrusted with the task, and that is as it should be.
('71', 227, 1, 10, 482968) By the eighth resolution, the meaning of the abolition of untouchability from the standpoint of the Sangh has been clarified.
('71', 227, 1, 11, 483094) The limits which have been accepted by the Harijan Sevak Sangh for crores of persons so far as the abolition of untouchability is concerned, are in no way sufficient for members of the Sangh who regard truth and non violence from my standpoint.
('71', 227, 1, 12, 483339) So long as there are restrictions as regards inter dining and intermarriage, untouchability is bound to survive to some extent.
('71', 227, 1, 13, 483467) It is necessary for members of the Sangh to give up these restrictions.
('71', 227, 1, 14, 483539) Anyone who sincerely serves Harijans cannot possibly observe such restrictions.
('71', 227, 1, 15, 483619) Although the ninth resolution is not related to the constructive work of the Congress, it is closely connected with the economic condition of India.
('71', 227, 1, 16, 483768) Crores of rupees are lost because of our indifference towards our cattle wealth.
('71', 227, 1, 17, 483849) The struggle between the cow and the buffalo on the one hand and between cattle and man on the other can continue only to the detriment of all the three.
('71', 227, 1, 18, 484003) This is because if cows are allowed to perish, buffaloes are bound to follow suit and drag human beings behind.
('71', 227, 1, 19, 484115) The latter will survive if cows do, but buffaloes have either to return to their original wild state or continue to survive in a very small number.
('71', 227, 1, 20, 484263) The Sangh has pointed out the easy, straight and consequently inexpensive way of escaping such an untimely death; and that is to insist upon using cows milk and nothing but cows milk and its products.
('71', 227, 1, 21, 484464) This objective will probably be achieved without much difficulty if an all out effort is

('71', 228, 7, 14, 485617) Powerful people very often get away with misdeeds and so we cannot hope to convince anybody if we criticize such conduct for there is considerable truth in the popular maxim.
('71', 228, 7, 15, 485792) That is why even Tulsidas wrote: The powerful are never guilty. But the big may do whatever they like; how does that concern us?
('71', 228, 7, 16, 485921) What reply can we give to those who take cover behind the misdeeds of big people to hide their own?

('71', 229, 6, 13, 486716) Lilavatis shortcomings are numerous but she has as many virtues.
('71', 229, 6, 14, 486781) Either she should win you over or you have to win her over.
('71', 229, 6, 15, 486841) Please think over this.

('71', 229, 12, 29, 487405) You have been a little hasty in forming your opinion about Lilavati.
('71', 229, 12, 30, 487474) She is proud and is prone to anger, but has no malice at all.
('71', 229, 12, 31, 487536) You have to learn much from everybody.

('71', 230, 7, 13, 488194) But don't tax yourself.

('71', 232, 6, 16, 490953) BARDOLI, [MAY 11, 1937 ] 5
('71', 232, 7, 17, 490980) CONGRESS WORKER: But it is 11 miles from the Railway Station, and you have said that the place should not be more than seven miles from the Station.
('71', 232, 7, 18, 491129) Sydla is two furlongs and Afwa only two miles.
('71', 232, 8, 19, 491176) GANDHIJI: If I said seven miles, I meant seventy.
('71', 232, 8, 20, 491226) At any rate that should be our aim.
('71', 232, 8, 21, 491262) We have ultimately to reach the villages which are considered inaccessible today.
('71', 232, 8, 22, 491344) And where else can you have this vast supply of water and so much open space for the thousands of people we are going to have, as also for the numerous cows we shall need for
('71', 232, 9, 23, 491519) 1 Harihar Sharma 2 Wife of Surendra Mashruwala 3 Surendra Mashruwala 4 Some Congress workers who disapproved of Haripura ('town of God') as the Congress venue, met Gandhiji at Swaraj Ashram.
('71', 232, 9, 24, 491710) This is extracted from the "Weekly Letter" by Mahadev Desai, who had reported: "We spent two days in Bardoli .
('71', 232, 9, 25, 491821) .Ever since we have decided to hold the Congress in villages, the selection of the venue .
('71', 232, 9, 26, 491912) becomes an additional problem .
('71', 232, 9, 27, 491944) There are several villages in Bardoli taluka that have made themselves famous during recent years by their sacrifice and suffering .
('71', 232, 9, 28, 492077) But Gandhiji showed them that we could not afford to go by that consideration alone.
('71', 232, 9, 29, 492162) The place selected should be in the heart of villages and it should have natural advantages .
('71', 232, 9, 30, 492256) Haripura, therefore, which is beautifully situated on the river Tapti, with vast stretches of unarable land right on its bank easily captured Gandhiji's heart." 5 From The Hindu, 13 5 1937 and 19 5 1937
('71', 233, 0, 1, 492459) 234 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 233, 1, 2, 492501) And then what a charming name is Haripura!
('71', 233, 1, 3, 492544) Hari meaning God.
('71', 233, 2, 4, 492562) It will be frightfully expensive, everything having to be carried ten miles by motor lorries and buses.
('71', 233, 2, 5, 492666) It is not in the centre of the taluk, as are other places, and the village people will be hard put to it in going from one end of the taluk to the other.
('71', 233, 2, 6, 492820) Why should we fight shy of the distances and why should we have motor lorries?
('71', 233, 2, 7, 492899) We have any number of bullock carts in the taluk.
('71', 233, 3, 8, 492949) If we have the Congress at Afwa, we can have water from Bardoli at little expense.
('71', 233, 3, 9, 493032) The ginning companies would readily oblige us with their engines for electricity and something like Rs. 15,000 would be saved.
('71', 233, 3, 10, 493159) That means that we should always have our Congress in the vicinity of towns and cities!
('71', 233, 3, 11, 493247) Why should we not do without electricity?
('71', 233, 3, 12, 493289) And while people from Surat and the neighbouring villages will flock to Afwa near Bardoli, what about the Raniparaj peoplethe hill peoplewhom we want to acquaint somewhat with the Congress?
('71', 233, 3, 13, 493479) You must not be swayed by my argument unless it appeals to your reason and experience.

('71', 233, 7, 19, 493757) Otherwise how could a letter sent to you C/o Searchlight go astray?
('71', 233, 7, 20, 493825) But take a lesson from this, that I dont forget to write to you.
('71', 233, 7, 21, 493890) I reply to you as soon as I receive your letter.

('71', 234, 1, 2, 494542) which can certainly be described as good.
('71', 234, 1, 3, 494584) Tithal is right on the sea coast, so it will be sufficiently cool.

('71', 234, 1, 5, 494698) Just now we are in Navsari.

('71', 234, 6, 16, 495236) I am surprised at my remarks 1 being misunderstood.
('71', 234, 6, 17, 495288) I still maintain that whilst Lord Zetland's statement is agreeably worded, it does not remove the deadlock in the sense that it gives no specific answer to the specific Congress demand, namely, that the method in which the Governors will use their powers of interference whenever they fear an emergency would be that of dismissal of the Ministry rather than expecting the Ministry to resign or submit to the Governor's wishes.
('71', 234, 6, 18, 495715) I hold that this is perfectly consitutional and equally honourable for both parties.
('71', 234, 6, 19, 495800) The Governors will reason with their Ministers.
('71', 234, 6, 20, 495848) The Ministers would be bound courteously to listen to what they say.But if reason fails to carry conviction the only proper course for both parties would be for the Governors to dismiss such Ministers and dissolve the Assembly or take whatever measures may be open to them constitutionally.

('71', 235, 2, 3, 496612) TITHAL, BULSAR, MAY 12, 1937
('71', 235, 3, 4, 496641) VIJAYA, I met Naranbhai 1 .
('71', 235, 3, 5, 496669) Sardar also was present.
('71', 235, 3, 6, 496694) We had a long talk.
('71', 235, 3, 7, 496714) His love for you is boundless.
('71', 235, 3, 8, 496745) When I talked about Manubhai 2 he started crying.
('71', 235, 3, 9, 496795) He said: "If she wants to marry only with our consent, why does she bring up Manubhai's name every time?
('71', 235, 3, 10, 496900) We will never be pleased with that marriage.
('71', 235, 3, 11, 496945) She has taken a pledge to remain unmarried.
('71', 235, 3, 12, 496989) Let her keep it.
('71', 235, 3, 13, 497006) But if at all she wants to marry, then there are two or three good young men in our community; she may select one of them." This is the substance of what he said.
('71', 235, 3, 14, 497169) I pacified him.
('71', 235, 3, 15, 497185) I told him that you were not bent upon marrying him.
('71', 235, 3, 16, 497238) If you at all marry, I said, you would marry Manubhai, but that if your parents would not gladly give you their blessings you would be prepared to remain unmarried.
('71', 235, 3, 17, 497403) I also told him that you certainly wished that they should not press you to marry anybody else.
('71', 235, 3, 18, 497499) Sardar also spoke in favour of Manubhai.
('71', 235, 3, 19, 497540) He said that now in this age girls should be given some freedom; after having educated them we should not expect that they should always obey our wishes.
('71', 235, 3, 20, 497694) But all this had no effect on Naranbhai.
('71', 235, 3, 21, 497735) I have assured him that I would not marry you off to Manubhai secretly.
('71', 235, 3, 22, 497807) Now my advice is that if you wish you may send this letter to Manubhai.
('71', 235, 3, 23, 497879) Even if you don't do that, you may, if you think it proper, write to him and tell him that your marriage is likely to be delayed and may not even come off.
('71', 235, 3, 24, 498035) I am sure you would not wish to marry after the death of your parents.
('71', 235, 3, 25, 498106) Both of you should wish that they may live long.
('71', 235, 3, 26, 498155) It would be a different matter if your patience, your blameless conduct and Manubhai's purity should melt their hearts.
('71', 235, 3, 27, 498275) But I do not think that in this case anything except time and the conduct of you both can have any effect.
('71', 235, 3, 28, 498382) If occasion arises I would certainly be ready to say more.
('71', 235, 3, 29, 498441) But I shall not have the courage to hurt them.
('71', 235, 3, 30, 498488) Sardar is going to try.
('71', 235, 3, 31, 498512) I see that Manubhai has become impatient.
('71', 235, 3, 32, 498554) He should have patience.
('71', 235, 3, 33, 498579) You must have got my last letter 3 .

('71', 236, 5, 9, 499212) KANTI, Only today I got your letter.
('71', 236, 5, 10, 499249) We reached here just today.
('71', 236, 5, 11, 499277) Bal has come.
('71', 236, 5, 12, 499291) Tomorrow he will leave for that side.
('71', 236, 5, 13, 499329) You have been travelling a good deal and also gathering a lot of experience.
('71', 236, 5, 14, 499406) Did you carefully see the old family houses in Porbandar?
('71', 236, 5, 15, 499464) Each and every room has a history.
('71', 236, 5, 16, 499499) I didn't know at all that Navin was there.
('71', 236, 5, 17, 499542) You may by all means stay in Bangalore.

('71', 236, 6, 21, 499667) Perhaps you will get more experience in Bangalore.
('71', 236, 6, 22, 499718) Devdas says that your letters to him are very short.
('71', 236, 6, 23, 499771) Write in detail.
('71', 236, 6, 24, 499788) Describe your daily programme also.
('71', 236, 6, 25, 499824) Harilal has again become unbalanced.
('71', 236, 6, 26, 499861) He has again written a letter to the newspapers saying all kinds of things.
('71', 236, 6, 27, 499937) He has left the Swami with whom he was staying.
('71', 236, 6, 28, 499985) It is difficult to say what he will do now.
('71', 236, 6, 29, 500029) I have put my trust in God.
('71', 236, 6, 30, 500057) He may do as He wills.
('71', 236, 6, 31, 500080) I am accompanied by Ba, Kano, Manu, Kanaiyo, Mahadev, Pyarelal and Radhakishan.
('71', 236, 6, 32, 500160) Sharda (Chimanlal's) is expected to come.
('71', 236, 6, 33, 500202) You may come whenever you wish.
('71', 236, 6, 34, 500234) There is enough room here.
('71', 236, 6, 35, 500261) I am getting good experience of Bachu.
('71', 236, 6, 36, 500300) I am convinced that the intellect can be fully developed while learning different crafts.
('71', 236, 6, 37, 500390) This is not to forbid literary studies, but only to say that the intellect can be best developed through crafts.
('71', 236, 6, 38, 500503) Literary studies then become a very easy task and take their proper place.

('71', 238, 3, 4, 501714) MY DEAR IDIOT, Your two letters of 7th and 11th respectively have just come in.
('71', 238, 3, 5, 501794) We arrived here yesterday 3 p.m.
('71', 238, 3, 6, 501827) Whether four days gap is too long or not is a matter of opinion.
('71', 238, 3, 7, 501892) I certainly missed your letter in Bardoli as also here yesterday.
('71', 238, 3, 8, 501958) But you are always excused.
('71', 238, 3, 9, 501986) I do not want your letters at the cost of your health or your work.
('71', 238, 3, 10, 502054) But I want them when you can give them to me without strain and stress.
('71', 238, 3, 11, 502126) Your letter to the Municipality is good.
('71', 238, 3, 12, 502167) If no relief is immediately given, you should certainly expose the Municipality.
('71', 238, 3, 13, 502248) Why not write to Lady Linlithgow?
('71', 238, 3, 14, 502282) Invite her to visit the quarters.
('71', 238, 3, 15, 502316) I am not going to issue a certificate of merit until you possess excellent health.
('71', 238, 3, 16, 502399) And you can do it, if you will be carefree and take plenty of milk, juicy fruit and salads.
('71', 238, 3, 17, 502491) What is the quantity of milk you take now?
('71', 238, 3, 18, 502534) I do not believe in your reserving things to be told to me when we meet.
('71', 238, 3, 19, 502607) You either forget them or the things are too stale to bear telling or there is no time.
('71', 238, 3, 20, 502695) When you have a hailstorm, why can't you say "God knows best?" If He does not, who does?
('71', 238, 3, 21, 502784) When we have what we call magnificent weather, why should we thank God, and why not when there is uncomfortable hailstorm?
('71', 238, 3, 22, 502907) I can understand not thanking at all.
('71', 238, 3, 23, 502945) But we do, whether we say it in so many words or not, every time we feel pleased.
('71', 238, 3, 24, 503027) To be pleased is to express thanks by action.

('71', 239, 2, 4, 503371) We may not make light of the matter.
('71', 239, 2, 5, 503408) It is serious enough in Bapu's opinion, and will need a considerable amount of propaganda.
('71', 239, 2, 6, 503499) But it is clear that we may not finance it.
('71', 239, 2, 7, 503543) This sort of spoon feeding cannot last long.
('71', 239, 2, 8, 503588) However Bapu thinks you may ask Parameswaran Pillai to submit you a detailed budget.
('71', 239, 2, 9, 503673) We can then examine it and be in a better position to decide.
('71', 239, 2, 10, 503735) We shall expect you here on the 20th.

('71', 239, 6, 16, 503899) PREMA, Only today I got your letter and I am replying to it immediately.
('71', 239, 6, 17, 503972) Your previous letter is still lying in my file.
('71', 239, 6, 18, 504020) But let me dispose of this.
('71', 239, 6, 19, 504048) I will see about the other later.
('71', 239, 6, 20, 504082) Tell Sushila that, if all of you had come here, I could have accommodated you but wouldnt have been able to give you the privacy you had there.
('71', 239, 6, 21, 504226) Nor the cold of that place, if your description of it is correct.
('71', 239, 6, 22, 504292) Here we do feel the heat.
('71', 239, 6, 23, 504318) I dont know if injustice has been done to Nariman.
('71', 239, 6, 24, 504369) 2 Why should it be assumed that the leader of Bombay should become the leader of the whole Presidency?
('71', 239, 6, 25, 504472) And can anybody misguide or coerce all the representatives of three Provinces?
('71', 239, 6, 26, 504551) If injustice has been done, why do all those representatives, who are still alive, put up with it?
('71', 239, 6, 27, 504650) I, therefore, don't understand this talk about injustice.
('71', 239, 6, 28, 504708) I don't even
('71', 239, 7, 29, 504721) 1 In his letter dated May 7 to Mahadev Desai, the addressee had written: "Parameswaran Pillai wants financial help for carrying on propaganda work.
('71', 239, 7, 30, 504869) I don't know how Bapu thinks about it, but personally I should not like to give undue importance to Cochin order.
('71', 239, 7, 31, 504983) Perhaps thereby we would not help the cause." 2 K.F. Nariman, President, Bombay Provincial Congress Committee, who was defeated in the Bombay Legislature leadership election, had charged Vallabhbhai Patel with bringing about his defeat.
('71', 239, 7, 32, 505220) This led to a prolonged controversy which was finally settled by arbitrators, who declared Vallabhbhai Patel free from blame.

('71', 240, 1, 3, 505438) I felt that the whole agitation was got up.
('71', 240, 1, 4, 505482) But if I don't understand this matter properly, you may reason with me and convince me.
('71', 240, 1, 5, 505570) I have no antipathy to Nariman.
('71', 240, 1, 6, 505602) My attitude has nothing to do with the charges which have been levelled against him.
('71', 240, 1, 7, 505687) The truth or falsehood of these charges can be inquired into whenever Nariman wishes.
('71', 240, 1, 8, 505773) I learnt only today that he is your friend.
('71', 240, 1, 9, 505817) I have expressed my opinion in a perfectly objective spirit.
('71', 240, 1, 10, 505878) I was pained to read about .
('71', 240, 1, 11, 505907) 1 I have published only what both of them told me and that, too, becuase she wanted me to publish it.
('71', 240, 1, 12, 506009) It seems to me that .
('71', 240, 1, 13, 506031) 2 makes no distinction between truth and falsehood.
('71', 240, 1, 14, 506083) You may show her this.
('71', 240, 1, 15, 506106) I had written to Dev.
('71', 240, 1, 16, 506128) I have received his reply.
('71', 240, 1, 17, 506155) I did not write immediately.
('71', 240, 1, 18, 506184) I was glad to learn that the work in Saswad has not been given up.
('71', 240, 1, 19, 506251) I believe in the saying, "Not to embark upon a thing in the first instance." If you take up any other work now, cling to it.
('71', 240, 1, 20, 506376) It would have been better if you four had asked me to give you an appointment.
('71', 240, 1, 21, 506455) I accept your argument that I wouldn't have been able to say much without knowing the position at Saswad.
('71', 240, 1, 22, 506561) You are also right in saying that this is only the beginning of my experience of village life, and that, therefore, all of us are equal in that respect.
('71', 240, 1, 23, 506714) Even so, my ideas have an element of originality in them, and the power behind them comes from ahimsa.
('71', 240, 1, 24, 506817) I think, therefore, that all four of you would have learnt something from me.
('71', 240, 1, 25, 506895) I like your effort to learn the art of thinking for I had found your speech 3 at Hudli lacking in thought.
('71', 240, 1, 26, 507002) Your ideas there seemed to me like so much smoke emitted by your brain.
('71', 240, 1, 27, 507074) They were not outpourings of the heart.
('71', 240, 1, 28, 507114) I wanted to spare some time and discuss them with you and convince you, as clearly as two and two make four, that there was no real thinking behind them.
('71', 240, 1, 29, 507268) But you left in a great hurry and so I did not get any opportunity.
('71', 240, 1, 30, 507336) Since I was in no hurry to prove to you your lack of thought, I didn't hold you back.
('71', 240, 1, 31, 507422) I was sure that you yourself would sooner or later see this deficiency in you.
('71', 240, 1, 32, 507501) And now I see your admission of it in this very letter of yours.
('71', 240, 1, 33, 507566) It is understandable that you do not see this deficiency in the ideas you expressed at Hudli.
('71', 240, 1, 34, 507660) But if you really learn how to think, you are

('71', 242, 1, 3, 509118) Bapu read both the letter and the enclosure and said you are wrong in thinkingas you seem to do with The Statesman 1that he is now making an additional demand.
('71', 242, 1, 4, 509278) He has made Government's work definitely easier by making the Congress demand free from ambiguity and no one can now say as Lord Zetland has done 2 that if an assurance were given it would lead to endless discussions about interpretation and allegations of breach of faith.
('71', 242, 1, 5, 509552) If the bare assurance 3 that Bapu has now reduced the Congress demand to is granted, there will be no questions of interpretation and no fear of breach of faith.
('71', 242, 1, 6, 509714) I am surprised that you do not see this.
('71', 242, 1, 7, 509755) You seem to have read more meaning in my sentence than I had meant.
('71', 242, 1, 8, 509823) 4 I meant to say that if the speech had been made two months ago it would have gone a long way in bringing about an understanding.
('71', 242, 1, 9, 509954) That is to say, from that statement to the assurance asked for by Bapu would have been a very easy step.
('71', 242, 1, 10, 510059) He has publicly recognized the conciliatory tone in which the speech was couched, but it leaves him enough loop hole to say that he meant nothing more than is laid down in the Government of India Act.
('71', 242, 1, 11, 510260) They must be prepared to face the fact that a new convention is being asked for by the party commanding the biggest majority in the country and it must be given.
('71', 242, 1, 12, 510422) Lord Lothian's letter 5 contains nothing new.
('71', 242, 1, 13, 510468) He wrote a much longer letter to Bapu on similar lines.
('71', 242, 2, 14, 510524) But more when we meet.

('71', 242, 3, 19, 511328) You also say that 'had he, viz., Zetland, said this right in the beginning, there would have been no impasse.' That shows that there is nothing wrong with the speech itself .

('71', 243, 6, 16, 512218) 256. THE CONSTRUCTIVE PROGRAMME The Working Committee has emphasized the necessity of the members of the Legislatures and other workers taking the constructive programme of 1920 to the three crore villagers between whom and their representatives a direct contact has been established.
('71', 243, 6, 17, 512503) The representatives may if they choose neglect them, or give them some paltry or even substantial relief from financial burdens; but they cannot give them self confidence, dignity and the power of continuously bettering their own position unless they will interest them in the fourfold constructive programme i.e., universal production and use of khadi through universal hand spinning, Hindu Muslim or rather communal unity, promotion of total prohibition by propaganda among those who are addicted to the drink habit, and removal by Hindus of untouchability root and branch.
('71', 243, 6, 18, 513079) It was announced in 1920 and 1921 from a thousand platforms that attainment of swaraj by the non violent method was impossible without these four things.
('71', 243, 6, 19, 513233) I hold that it is not less true today.
('71', 243, 6, 20, 513272) It is one thing to improve the economic condition of the masses by State regulation of taxation, and wholly another for them to feel that they have bettered their condition by their own sole personal effort.
('71', 243, 6, 21, 513480) Now this they can only do through hand spinning and other village handicrafts.
('71', 243, 6, 22, 513559) Similarly it is one thing to regulate communal conduct by

('71', 244, 1, 2, 513705) means of pacts between leaders, voluntary or imposed by the State; it is wholly different for the masses to respect one another's religious and outward observances.
('71', 244, 1, 3, 513870) This cannot be done unless the legislators and workers would go out among the villagers and teach them mutual toleration.
('71', 244, 1, 4, 513992) Again it is one thing to impose, as we must, prohibition by law, and another to sustain it by willing obedience to it.
('71', 244, 1, 5, 514111) It is a defeatist, arm chair mentality which says that it cannot work without an expensive and elaborate system of espionage.
('71', 244, 1, 6, 514237) Surely if the workers went out to the villagers and demonstrated the evil of drink wherever it is prevalent, and if research scholars found out the causes of alcoholism and proper knowledge was imparted to the people, prohibition should not only prove inexpensive but profitable.
('71', 244, 1, 7, 514517) This is a work essentially for women to handle.
('71', 244, 1, 8, 514565) Lastly, we may banish by statute, as we must, the evil consequences of untouchability.
('71', 244, 1, 9, 514652) But we cannot have real independence unless people banish the touch me not spirit from their hearts.
('71', 244, 1, 10, 514753) The masses cannot act as one man or with one mind unless they eradicate untouchability from their hearts.
('71', 244, 1, 11, 514859) Thus this and the three other items are a matter of true mass education.
('71', 244, 1, 12, 514932) And it has become imperatively necessary now that three crores of men and women have rightly or wrongly power put into their hands.
('71', 244, 1, 13, 515064) However hedged in it is, Congressmen and others who want the suffrages of these voters have it in their hands either to educate the three crores of mankind along the right lines or the wrong.
('71', 244, 1, 14, 515256) It would be the wrong line to neglect them altogether in matters which most vitally concern them.

('71', 244, 3, 17, 515398) With reference to my note 1 in Harijan of 17th April, 1937, about the alleged ill treatment of Christians by Hindus, I have received two letters.
('71', 244, 3, 18, 515544) One is from Shri C.K. Parameswaran Pillai, President of the Kerala Harijan Sevak Sangh, and the other from Dr. M.E. Naidoo of Nagercoil.
('71', 244, 3, 19, 515681) Shri Pillai writes:
('71', 244, 4, 20, 515701) I read in the Harijan your statement regarding the complaint made by Father Petro about the interference of an Excise peon with some new converts to Christianity.
('71', 244, 4, 21, 515864) As soon as I returned from Madras I wrote to this priest for detailed information regarding the incidents referred to in his card.

('71', 245, 1, 2, 516091) from him I sent a reminder yesterday.
('71', 245, 1, 3, 516129) If he gives me sufficient materials, I will enquire into the matter and make a report.
('71', 245, 1, 4, 516216) Dr. Naidoo writes a long letter sending me countercomplaints.
('71', 245, 1, 5, 516278) He cites 12 cases of disturbances by Christians during the last two years.
('71', 245, 1, 6, 516353) They are taken from his periodical reports made to the kerala provincial Harijan Sevak Sangh.
('71', 245, 1, 7, 516447) I take the following extracts 1 from his letter.
('71', 245, 1, 8, 516496) Of course the counter complaints cannot disapprove the charges brought by Father Petro.
('71', 245, 1, 9, 516584) I hope, therefore, that he will reply to Shri Shri Pillais letter and enable him to deal with or refute the charges brought by him.
('71', 245, 1, 10, 516716) It is the duty of the Harijan Sevak Sangh to promote harmony betweem Harijans and others with whom they come in daily contact.
('71', 245, 1, 11, 516843) It is equally its duty to protect Harijans from ill treatment as also to protect others from being molested by them.

('71', 245, 3, 14, 517005) A FRIEND WRITES: 3
('71', 245, 4, 15, 517024) In the current issue of Harijan Sevak in your article entitled A Moral Dilemma 4 you have observed, Many marriage taboos appear to have grown out of social customs.
('71', 245, 4, 16, 517189) 5 They are nowhere seen to rest on any vital, moral or religious principle. My own instinct based upon my experience tells me that probably these taboos were promulgated out of eugenic considerations.
('71', 245, 4, 17, 517390) It is a well known principle of the science of eugenics that the issue resulting from the crossing of exogamous elements is eugenically fitter than the product of endogamous unions.
('71', 245, 4, 18, 517572) That is the reason why in Hinduism sagotra ( ) and sapinda ( ) marriage are interdicted.
('71', 245, 4, 19, 517661) On the other hand if we admit social custom with all its kaleidoscopic variety and change to be sole reason for these taboos, we are left with no strong reason why marriages between paternal uncle and niece, or for the matter of that between brother and sister, should absolutely be tabooed.
('71', 245, 4, 20, 517953) If, as you say, the begetting of progeny be the only legitimate object of marriage then the choice of partners would become purely a question of eugenic harmony.
('71', 245, 4, 21, 518115) Are all other considerations to be ruled
('71', 245, 5, 22, 518156) 1 Not reproduced here 2 The Hindi original of this appeared in Harijan Sevak, 15 5 1937, of which this is a slightly abridged translation by Pyarelal.

('71', 245, 5, 24, 518390) 4 Vide A Moral Dilemma, 29 5 1937 5 In Pyarelals translation, however, this reads: Marriage taboos are not universal and are largely based on social usage.

('71', 246, 1, 2, 518589) out of court as relatively unimportant?
('71', 246, 1, 3, 518629) If not, what should be their order of precedence?
('71', 246, 1, 4, 518679) I would set it down as follows; 1. mutual attraction or love; 2. eugenic fitness; 3. approval and consent of the respective families concerned; and consideration for the interest of the social order to which one belongs; 4. spiritual development.
('71', 246, 1, 5, 518926) What do you say to it?
('71', 246, 2, 6, 518949) I entirely agree with you that a married person who confines the sex act strictly to the purpose of procreation should be regarded as a brahmachari.
('71', 246, 2, 7, 519098) I also hold with you that in the case of a married couple who have practised the rule of purity and self control before and after marriage a single act of union must lead to conception.
('71', 246, 2, 8, 519284) In support of your first point there is in our Shastras the celebrated story of Vishwamitra and Arundhati, the wife of Vasishtha who in spite of her one hundred sons was greeted by Vishwamitra as a perfect brahmacharini, whose command even the elements were bound to obey because her connubial relations with her husband were purely directed to the attainment and discharge of the function of motherhood.
('71', 246, 2, 9, 519689) But I doubt whether even the Hindu Shastras would support your ideal of having only one offspring irrespective of whether it is male or female.
('71', 246, 2, 10, 519833) It seems to me, therefore, that if you liberalize your ideal of married life so as to include the begetting of one male offspring in addition to the possible female ones, it would go a long way towards satisfying many married couples.
('71', 246, 2, 11, 520068) I do not know what the scientific basis for the various taboos in respect of marriage relationships is.
('71', 246, 2, 12, 520172) But it seems to me clear that a social custom or usage that helps the practice of virtue and self control should have the sanctity of a moral law.
('71', 246, 2, 13, 520319) If it is eugenic considerations that are at the root of interdiction of marriages between brother and sister, then they ought to apply equally to cousin marriages.
('71', 246, 2, 14, 520483) A safe rule of conduct, therefore, would be as a rule to respect such taboos where they exist in a marriage enumerated by my correspondent.
('71', 246, 2, 15, 520623) But I would change their order of importance and put 'love' last in the list.
('71', 246, 2, 16, 520701) By giving it the first place, the other conditions are liable to be overshadowed by it altogether and rendered more or less nugatory.
('71', 246, 2, 17, 520835) Therefore, spiritual development ought to be given the first place in the choice for marriage.
('71', 246, 2, 18, 520930) Service should come next, family considerations and the interest of the social order should have the third place, and mutual attraction or 'love' the fourth and the last place.
('71', 246, 2, 19, 521107) This means that 'love' alone, where the other four conditions are not fulfilled, should not be held as a valid reason for marriage.
('71', 246, 2, 20, 521239) At the same time, marriage where there is no love should equally be ruled out even though all the other conditions are fully complied with.
('71', 246, 2, 21, 521379) I should score out the condition of eugenic fitness, because the begetting of offspring being the central purpose of marriage, eugenic
('71', 247, 0, 1, 521514) 248 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 247, 1, 2, 521556) fitness cannot be treated merely as a condition, it is the sine qua non of marriage.
('71', 247, 1, 3, 521641) Hindu Shastras certainly show a marked bias in favour of the male offspring.
('71', 247, 1, 4, 521718) But this orginated at a time when physical warfare was the order of the day and adequate man power was a sine qua non of success in the struggle for existence.
('71', 247, 1, 5, 521878) The number of sons that a man had was therefore then looked upon as a mark of virility and strength and to facilitate the begetting of numerous offspring even polygamy was sanctioned and encouraged.
('71', 247, 1, 6, 522077) But if we regard marriage as a sacrament, there is room in it only for one offspring, and that is why in our Shastras the first offspring, described as [dharmaja], i.e., 'duty born', all subsequent issues being referred to as [kamaja], i.e., lust born'.
('71', 247, 1, 7, 522331) I make no distinction between son and daughter.
('71', 247, 1, 8, 522379) Such distinction is in my opinion invidious and wrong.
('71', 247, 1, 9, 522434) The birth of a son or a daughter should be welcome alike.
('71', 247, 1, 10, 522492) The story of Vishwamitra and Vasishtha is good as an illustration of the principle that the sexual act performed solely for the purpose of begetting offspring is not inconsistent with the highest ideal of brahmacharya.
('71', 247, 1, 11, 522711) But the whole of that story need not be taken literally.
('71', 247, 1, 12, 522768) Sexual intercourse for the purpose of carnal satisfaction is reversion to animality, and it should therefore be man's endeavour to rise above it.
('71', 247, 1, 13, 522914) But failure to do so as between husband and wife cannot be regarded as a sin or a matter of obloquy.
('71', 247, 1, 14, 523015) Millions in this world eat for the satisfaction of their palate; similarly millions of the husbands and wives indulge in the sex act for their carnal satisfaction and will continue to do so and also pay the inexorable penalty in the shape of numberless ills with which nature visits all violations of its order.
('71', 247, 1, 15, 523327) The ideal of absolute brahmacharya or of married brahmacharya is for those who aspire to a spiritual or higher life; it is the sine qua non of such life.

('71', 249, 8, 17, 526110) One who has malice stings.
('71', 249, 8, 18, 526137) Lilavati speaks out on the instant whatever she feelbut harbours no ill will afterwards.
('71', 249, 8, 19, 526226) Anybody who has malice cannot tolerate the happiness of others and will never hesitate to harm him or her when an opportunity occurs.
('71', 249, 8, 20, 526360) I have not seen Lilavati ever doing this.
('71', 249, 8, 21, 526402) To speak sarcastically is not a sign of malice.
('71', 249, 8, 22, 526450) It is just a way of speaking with some.
('71', 249, 8, 23, 526490) It is a fact that she looks up to very few with respect.
('71', 249, 8, 24, 526547) But that is only a sign of pride.
('71', 249, 8, 25, 526581) One who is eager to have good relations with others should keep silent and serve them as much as possible.
('71', 249, 8, 26, 526688) You have less thinking power and have, therefore, less capacity for weighing things.
('71', 249, 8, 27, 526773) You should therefore, practise writing and expressing your thoughts clearly so that you may learn to think clearly.
('71', 249, 8, 28, 526889) And you must study some book of deep wisdom.
('71', 249, 8, 29, 526934) Such a book is the Ramayana or the Gita.
('71', 249, 8, 30, 526975) You have very straightforward nature and a strong moral character, and they

('71', 250, 6, 11, 527575) It will be enough for me if you and Lilavati only adjust yourselves to each other.
('71', 250, 6, 12, 527658) It was certainly good that all the pent up feelings came out that day.
('71', 250, 6, 13, 527729) I followed what you have written about Mirabehn.
('71', 250, 6, 14, 527778) If she had no shortcomings at all, she would be a saint.
('71', 250, 6, 15, 527835) We should only see everybody's virtues.
('71', 250, 6, 16, 527875) Is there anybody who has no shortcomings?
('71', 250, 6, 17, 527917) We should not, therefore, even think about them.
('71', 250, 6, 18, 527966) If we look at people's shortcomings only, we would be sure to go mad and be left alone in the world.
('71', 250, 6, 19, 528067) I understand about Chiranjilal.
('71', 250, 6, 20, 528099) If we bear in mind that we are servants, then anyone being a leader should not hurt us.
('71', 250, 6, 21, 528187) We may not submit to anybody's order for our selfish interest, but for the sake of service we may make ourselves slaves of the whole world.

('71', 251, 3, 14, 529051) Anna is a very experienced man.
('71', 251, 3, 15, 529083) I had heard all that he had to say.
('71', 251, 3, 16, 529119) I have requested him to console Lilavati.
('71', 251, 3, 17, 529161) He can do it.

('71', 252, 1, 5, 530335) What you say is of course true.
('71', 252, 1, 6, 530367) One should be satisfied, as you say, with that much for public service.
('71', 252, 1, 7, 530439) One should not feel embarrassed in asking to be paid enough for subsistence in return.

('71', 252, 1, 12, 530811) You may send her over here whenever you wish.

('71', 252, 1, 14, 530926) I would certainly not consign her to just any kind of place.
('71', 252, 1, 15, 530987) If, however, you send her over to me, you must notthen worry about her.

('71', 255, 1, 2, 535197) 271. THE REED V. THE FOUNTAIN PEN 1
('71', 255, 2, 3, 535233) I am tempted to share with the reader the following letter 2 received by Mahadev Desai:
('71', 255, 3, 4, 535321) Some time back in an article entitled Wanted Rural mindedness, you recommended, as a step in that direction, the adoption of the reedpen in the place of the fountain pen.
('71', 255, 3, 5, 535492) I was struck by your argument, and after reading Bapu's interpretation of the A. I. V. I. A. membership pledge 3 , I laid aside my fountain pen and took to the reed, nine months back.
('71', 255, 3, 6, 535676) I was not altogether unused to the reed pen.
('71', 255, 3, 7, 535721) .After a month of baffling experience, however, I was again forced to return to the fountain pen a sadder and a wiser man.
('71', 255, 3, 8, 535844) The reasons which compelled the change were as follows:
('71', 255, 4, 9, 535900) 1. It took three hours to copy out matter, using a reed pen, that could be done with the fountain pen in one hour and a half.
('71', 255, 5, 10, 536026) 2. It took at least from a quarter of an hour to three quarters of an hour to mend one reed pen by means of an indigenous village knife.
('71', 255, 6, 11, 536163) 3. The fountain pen enables you to make short jottings and entries, so indispensable in the course of village work, while standing, or while you are on the move.
('71', 255, 6, 12, 536325) When I reverted to the use of the reed pen, I invariably found that my diary writing and maintanance of other daily records and registers fell heavily into arrears.
('71', 255, 7, 13, 536490) Surely, it is no part of the policy of the A.I.V.I.A. to slave drive its workers to the very limit of their capacity .
('71', 255, 8, 14, 536609) At the same time it would be unconscionable to go on using the fountain pen in the teeth of the clear injunction of the A.I.V.I.A. .
('71', 255, 9, 15, 536742) As I write this another argument occurs to me.
('71', 255, 9, 16, 536789) Perhaps you will find it to be specious as the preceding ones.
('71', 255, 9, 17, 536852) Bapu welcomes the Singer machine as an aid to the tailer's needle; why should he not extend the same welcome to other domestic tools and appliances that are no less helpful to the individual householder .
('71', 255, 9, 18, 537057) .The A.I.V.I.A. does not oppose the use of the plough, the spinning wheel and the fly shuttle loom in the place respectively of the hoe, the takli and the old fashioned simple pit loom by the cultivator if he feels so inclined.
('71', 255, 9, 19, 537285) Why stop at that and interdict the use, further, of more advanced and efficient appliances of a like nature?
('71', 255, 9, 20, 537394) Is not your insistence on the use of the inefficient and fragile reed pen in the place of a metal nib of a piece with asking people in this age of iron and electricity to discard

('71', 256, 1, 3, 537929) You have applied yourself to the task of improving village tools.
('71', 256, 1, 4, 537995) I would like you to suggest the nature and extent of the improvements which you would like to see effected.
('71', 256, 1, 5, 538103) The above letter is written partly in jest, partly in earnest and partly as a dialectical exercise for its own sake in which the writer obviously luxuriates.
('71', 256, 1, 6, 538261) His whole argument boils down to this that modern appliances are capable of more speed then their earlier prototypes.
('71', 256, 1, 7, 538379) If the consideration of speed were ruled out, there would hardly be left anything from his argument for me to answer.
('71', 256, 1, 8, 538497) But the village movement, as I conceive it, does not discount speed or efficiency of production.
('71', 256, 1, 9, 538594) Our village folk need all the efficiency that we can give them and more.
('71', 256, 1, 10, 538667) The A.I.V.I.A. is doing its level best to increase the speed of production consistently with its ideal and self imposed limits.
('71', 256, 1, 11, 538795) Already the speed of the takli has been increased beyond the wildest expectations of its protagonists.
('71', 256, 1, 12, 538898) But this was achieved without the slightest sacrifice of the principle of ruralmindedness.
('71', 256, 1, 13, 538989) More, I claim that the marvellous ingenuity and skill which rendered this possible could only spring from a village brain.
('71', 256, 1, 14, 539112) The limiting principle that was kept in view in effecting improvement in the speed of the takli , the spinning wheel and other domestic tools should hold good in respect of the writing pen too.
('71', 256, 1, 15, 539306) The rush and hurry of the town have no place in the village.
('71', 256, 1, 16, 539367) The village dweller has not to work under high pressure or to speed about from place to place in motor cars and trams like the city dwellers.
('71', 256, 1, 17, 539509) All this work is done by the easier and more natural modes of locomotion.
('71', 256, 1, 18, 539583) Similarly the fountain pen can have no place in his economy.
('71', 256, 1, 19, 539644) I might, perhaps, reluctantly go so far as to admit the steel nib as a compromise, but that is all.
('71', 256, 1, 20, 539744) The steel nib in my opinion has spelt the death of the calligraphist's art the mending of a reed pen was itself an art.
('71', 256, 1, 21, 539864) It called into play the artistic skill and the personality of the scribe that was reflected in the characters which he traced.
('71', 256, 1, 22, 539991) All that has gone with the advent of the steel pen.
('71', 256, 1, 23, 540043) But the steel pen has not done even half the mischief that the fountain pen is doing.
('71', 256, 1, 24, 540129) The introduction of the fountain pen in the village, to me, marks the beginning of the end of the existence of the village as such and its slow metamorphosis into the city.
('71', 256, 1, 25, 540302) The analogy of the Singer machine v.
('71', 256, 1, 26, 540339) the tailor's needle adduced by the writer is misleading.
('71', 256, 1, 27, 540396) The Singer machine was intended to supplement the work of the needle.
('71', 256, 1, 28, 540466) It was never intended to be introduced into every hut and home.
('71', 256, 1, 29, 540530) The purpose which it was calculated to serve and which it has actually served is to increase the speed of the individual needle to such an extent as to make hand stitching a profitable whole time avocation for the needy, unemployed

('71', 257, 1, 2, 540804) of the cities.
('71', 257, 1, 3, 540819) The fountain pen has rendered an analogous service to the art of stenography, and as such it can certainly claim a place as a useful adjunct of city life.
('71', 257, 1, 4, 540974) The argument that I have used in connection with the fountain pen applies mutatis mutandis to the other points raised by the correspondent in question.
('71', 257, 1, 5, 541126) Clearly it is not possible to lay down hard and fast rules in all such cases.
('71', 257, 1, 6, 541204) Let everybody strive to cultivate and practise the principle of rural mindedness as best as he or she can.
('71', 257, 1, 7, 541311) Only let the worker from the city who goes out to work in the villages take care that he does not turn the heads and confuse the intelligence of the simple minded village folk, whom ostensibly he is anxious to serve but whose requirements and standards of values and utility are altogether different from that of the city dweller.

('71', 259, 1, 3, 543976) However, I am sorry that the inmates at Segaon do not regard the world as one family.
('71', 259, 1, 4, 544062) For a devoted servant of the people such a feeling is essential.
('71', 259, 1, 5, 544127) Those in whom it is born are seen bahaving with a family spirit wherever they go, although the other people might be utter strangers to them and all of them might have different spheres of activity.
('71', 259, 1, 6, 544326) Moreover, family spirit does not require mutual co operation.
('71', 259, 1, 7, 544388) Among members of the same family, some may be so straightforward by nature that they live in harmony with other members of the family who are curt.
('71', 259, 1, 8, 544536) There is truth in your complaint that Segaon has become a dharmashala.
('71', 259, 1, 9, 544607) But what can I do?
('71', 259, 1, 10, 544626) I feel helpless.
('71', 259, 1, 11, 544643) Although I keep off many, there are some whom I simply cannot.
('71', 259, 1, 12, 544706) But I do hope that we shall succeed in cultivating a family spirit in Segaon.
('71', 259, 1, 13, 544784) If we do not succeed, then it is certain that we will be able to achieve nothing at Segaon.
('71', 259, 1, 14, 544876) I will, of course, be vigilant myself and also keep a watch on all others.
('71', 259, 1, 15, 544951) But the result will depend on the joint efforts of us all.

('71', 260, 2, 3, 546055) MAY 17, 1937
('71', 260, 3, 4, 546068) MY DEAR AGATHA, Your letter has just come.
('71', 260, 3, 5, 546111) And I hasten to answer.
('71', 260, 3, 6, 546135) Could I be more definite than when I said if Mr. Butler and Lord Zetland meant what the papers made out they did, why not straightway give the assurances in terms of the (Congress) resolution?
('71', 260, 3, 7, 546328) I have now gone a step further and said in so many words that when there is an emergency dismiss the Ministers.
('71', 260, 3, 8, 546440) The Bombay Governor's speech 1 , as I read it, is a denial of what Lord Zetland is supposed to have yielded in his recent speech 2 .
('71', 260, 3, 9, 546573) You must have seen the text.
('71', 260, 3, 10, 546602) And why is my remark on complete independence a knotty point?
('71', 260, 3, 11, 546664) Is it not in the Congress creed?
('71', 260, 3, 12, 546697) Is it not in the very resolution which was shown to the Governors and to which they raised no objection?
('71', 260, 3, 13, 546802) Perhaps you do not know the difficulties we have to combat here.
('71', 260, 3, 14, 546867) It is impossible to have mental reservations when you have millions of mankind to deal with, especially when you are training them not for an armed rebellion but for a peaceful revolution as yet unknown to history.
('71', 260, 3, 15, 547082) I want you therefore not to be agitated over what the diplomats say there or here.
('71', 260, 3, 16, 547165) Your and my first and last care is to hold on to the anchor at all costs but say nothing in anger, nothing equivocal, nothing short of the whole truth and then leave the result to the unseen and uncanny Power that over rules all our pet decisions at Its own sweet will.

('71', 261, 1, 4, 548046) I write not a line without deep conviction.
('71', 261, 1, 5, 548090) Zetland gave me some hope, Bombay 1 has shattered it if what he says is what Zetland meant.
('71', 261, 1, 6, 548182) But my conviction about the rightness of our position grows with their double dealing.
('71', 261, 1, 7, 548269) I would far rather cancel our resolution and accept office without any condition than accepting office under the delusion that Zetland's speech with Butler's annotation was a near enough response to our resolution.
('71', 261, 1, 8, 548484) Of course my conviction abides that unconditional acceptance would be fatal.
('71', 261, 1, 9, 548561) The other would be still more so.
('71', 261, 1, 10, 548595) The only honourable course therefore is to remain as we are till we get what we want and in the manner we want it.
('71', 261, 1, 11, 548710) But if all this sounds hopelessly unreal to you, you should resist me for my sake and what is more for the sake of the cause.

('71', 263, 6, 11, 550997) I wish you were here to share them.
('71', 263, 6, 12, 551033) We walk through the sea water every morning and evening.
('71', 263, 6, 13, 551090) It is a bracing walk.
('71', 263, 6, 14, 551112) Kanu the little one enjoys it most.
('71', 263, 6, 15, 551148) We are almost 25 strong now.
('71', 263, 6, 16, 551177) And presently we shall perhaps double the record.
('71', 263, 6, 17, 551227) Tithal is a little village.
('71', 263, 6, 18, 551255) It has only a few bungalows.
('71', 263, 6, 19, 551284) We are in Bhulabhai's.
('71', 263, 6, 20, 551307) He has hired another to take in the overflow.
('71', 263, 6, 21, 551353) He bears all the expenses.
('71', 263, 6, 22, 551380) I expect to leave this on 30th.
('71', 263, 6, 23, 551412) I do not mind the Seagon heat.
('71', 263, 6, 24, 551443) I must not absent myself for any length of time.
('71', 263, 6, 25, 551492) I am glad you were able to make a collection from the Club for Harijans.
('71', 263, 6, 26, 551565) Of course, the principal portion should go to the Harijans and khadi.
('71', 263, 6, 27, 551635) But I know you cannot, may not, force the pace.
('71', 263, 6, 28, 551683) This suppuration of the toe I do not like.
('71', 263, 6, 29, 551726) Nevertheless, it is good that the poison is coming out.
('71', 263, 6, 30, 551782) Are you having the hip baths?
('71', 263, 6, 31, 551812) What about the friction baths?
('71', 263, 6, 32, 551843) I wish you could master them and do them correctly.
('71', 263, 6, 33, 551895) Are you continuing garlic?
('71', 263, 6, 34, 551922) What about onion?
('71', 263, 6, 35, 551940) No fried things I hope.
('71', 263, 6, 36, 551964) And about dal 1?
('71', 263, 6, 37, 551981) Even a spoonful is poison for you.
('71', 263, 6, 38, 552016) Purest milk and butter if needed with green vegetables and juicy fruit is your food.
('71', 263, 6, 39, 552101) What is the quantity of milk?
('71', 263, 6, 40, 552131) Have you written to Balkrishna?

('71', 264, 2, 3, 552345) CHIMANLAL, I have been meaning to write to you all these days but in the mean time I got your letter today.
('71', 264, 2, 4, 552453) Sharda is fine.
('71', 264, 2, 5, 552469) For the present she seems to be happy.
('71', 264, 2, 6, 552508) If she can stay with me cheerfully, I am ready to relieve you of your responsibility regarding her.
('71', 264, 2, 7, 552608) I will fix her up where and when I think proper.
('71', 264, 2, 8, 552657) She will stay with me, of course, till she recoups her health.
('71', 264, 2, 9, 552720) I will give her whatever treatment I deem fit.
('71', 264, 2, 10, 552767) Just now she says she is quite ready to stay with me.
('71', 264, 2, 11, 552821) She also says that both you and Shakaribehn 1 are ready to entrust her to me.
('71', 264, 2, 12, 552899) She had not told me that she was suffering from leucorrhoea.
('71', 264, 2, 13, 552960) She felt shy.
('71', 264, 2, 14, 552974) It seems to have become chronic.
('71', 264, 2, 15, 553007) But I think it can be cured.
('71', 264, 2, 16, 553036) It will take time though.
('71', 264, 2, 17, 553062) I also understand about her marriage.
('71', 264, 2, 18, 553100) I have been thinking about the matter ever since she told me about it.
('71', 264, 2, 19, 553171) But marriage is out of the question till her health improves.
('71', 264, 2, 20, 553233) I would favour marrying her outside the caste and, if possible, even outside the Province.
('71', 264, 2, 21, 553324) But that remains to be seen.
('71', 264, 2, 22, 553353) Sharda herself is ready for this and she says that both of you also will be ready.
('71', 264, 2, 23, 553436) So much about Babu 2 .
('71', 264, 2, 24, 553459) Now regarding you two.
('71', 264, 2, 25, 553482) Babu is 20; but in some matters she is wiser than her age.
('71', 264, 2, 26, 553541) She seems to be much concerned for you both.
('71', 264, 2, 27, 553586) You haveShakariben hasRs. 3,000 and it is on that that you live at present.
('71', 264, 2, 28, 553662) I do not mind that.
('71', 264, 2, 29, 553682) You need not worry even after that amount is spent.
('71', 264, 2, 30, 553734) You ought not to care so much for possessions.
('71', 264, 2, 31, 553781) But since you have the money, let it remain.
('71', 264, 2, 32, 553826) I would not mind if, despite your having that money, you earn more somewhere by honest means.
('71', 264, 2, 33, 553920) But so long as you have it, it would be more becoming of you both to do public work without accepting anything.
('71', 264, 2, 34, 554032) But this is my personal view.
('71', 264, 2, 35, 554062) If it does not apeal to you, you may certainly follow another path.
('71', 264, 2, 36, 554130) Babu also told me that Vijapur did not suit you and that you wished to go somewhere else.
('71', 264, 2, 37, 554220) When I mentioned Rajkot, she said that that was the last place you would like to go to.
('71', 264, 2, 38, 554308) The reason, that the estrangement between Narandas and you still persists, pains me.
('71', 264, 2, 39, 554393) Being inmates of the Ashram, you two should be more than blood brothers to each other.
('71', 264, 2, 40, 554480) You ought to overcome your mutual antipathy.
('71', 264, 2, 41, 554525) I am sure that there is no deeper cause behind it.
('71', 264, 2, 42, 554576) You both have no personal interest to serve.
('71', 264, 2, 43, 554621) Why this enmity, then?
('71', 264, 2, 44, 554644) Hence, whatever disagreement you have must be one of principles only.
('71', 264, 2, 45, 554714) Why be afraid

('71', 265, 1, 2, 554820) of such disagreement?
('71', 265, 1, 3, 554842) If you wish, I may go deeper into the cause of this disagreement.
('71', 265, 1, 4, 554908) Whether you go to Rajkot or not, your antipathy to each other must end.
('71', 265, 1, 5, 554980) Babu says further that you prefer your own place.
('71', 265, 1, 6, 555030) I think nothing would be better than that, if you could settle down there.
('71', 265, 1, 7, 555105) If you stay there, the expenditure also would be less and you could serve the village more easily.
('71', 265, 1, 8, 555204) If, therefore, you can decide to stay in your village, you should do so.
('71', 265, 1, 9, 555277) If you wish, you may come and see me after the 25th.
('71', 265, 1, 10, 555330) I shall leave this place for Wardha on the 30th.
('71', 265, 1, 11, 555379) Don't worry at all about Babu.

('71', 266, 5, 13, 556603) LILAVATI, I have only today learnt of your vow of silence.
('71', 266, 5, 14, 556662) I can find no fault with it if the vow has been taken with understanding.
('71', 266, 5, 15, 556736) But if it is done out of anger, give it up.
('71', 266, 5, 16, 556780) Munnalal 1 and Anna write that you have a mind to pay a visit to Nagpur, but that you are refraining from asking me because you think I would not approve.
('71', 266, 5, 17, 556935) You do not have to ask me at all.
('71', 266, 5, 18, 556969) I have already given you permission to go to Nagpur or Bombay, wherever you want.
('71', 266, 5, 19, 557051) I would like you to live in a place where you can remain cheerful and where you can make all round progress.
('71', 266, 5, 20, 557160) If I say that I would not like your going to Nagpur or Bombay I only mean that if I were in your place I would not go there.
('71', 266, 5, 21, 557285) But this view has no value if it does not go well with you.
('71', 266, 5, 22, 557345) Hence, instead of your staying on in a suffocating place, I would really wish that you should go to either Nagpur or Bombay and come back refreshed.
('71', 266, 5, 23, 557494) Come only after you are well.
('71', 266, 5, 24, 557524) Ultimately, your good lies only in your hands, not mine.
('71', 266, 5, 25, 557581) I am now counting the days of my coming there.
('71', 266, 5, 26, 557628) It is not as if I had anything special to do here and Sardar had no purpose in keeping me here beyond making me enjoy the sea air.
('71', 266, 5, 27, 557759) I did have some work at Bardoli.
('71', 266, 5, 28, 557792) But then that some work does crop up wherever I may be is a different matter.

('71', 267, 3, 4, 558137) DEAR DR.
('71', 267, 3, 5, 558146) GODBOLE, I have now gone through your book carefully.
('71', 267, 3, 6, 558200) It is good so far as it goes.
('71', 267, 3, 7, 558230) Its price is prohibitive.
('71', 267, 3, 8, 558256) You have gone beyond the scope of the book which its title suggests but the chapters are scrappy.
('71', 267, 3, 9, 558354) Thus your examination of vegetarian and non vegetarian foods reproduces authorities quoted in vegetarian literature and contains nothing original.
('71', 267, 3, 10, 558501) I should expect an original contribution from an Indian scholar.
('71', 267, 3, 11, 558566) Then the chapter on breeding and feeding is very superficial.
('71', 267, 3, 12, 558628) Dairy experts tell me that breeding is the only thing.
('71', 267, 3, 13, 558683) Feeding is said to produce little impression on the milk yield.
('71', 267, 3, 14, 558747) I miss a chapter on comparison between buffalo and cow.
('71', 267, 3, 15, 558803) Can both be supported?
('71', 267, 3, 16, 558826) Which is the more economical animal?
('71', 267, 3, 17, 558863) As you may be aware, separated milk is being widely recommended by Dr. Aykroyd 1 .
('71', 267, 3, 18, 558946) But I do not find in your book enough instruction as to the ways in which it can be used.
('71', 267, 3, 19, 559036) I am myself making experiments within the limits of a villager and had hoped to find assistance in your book.
('71', 267, 3, 20, 559146) Nor have you examined the indigenous methods of using milk.

('71', 267, 7, 26, 559344) I got your letter only this morning.
('71', 267, 7, 27, 559381) Whose fault is it if I get your letters late and then in spite of my replying by return of post you also got my letters late?
('71', 267, 7, 28, 559507) You yourself had asked for permission to live in a village, which I gave.
('71', 267, 7, 29, 559581) What more could you do than riding, serving Harijans, lightening the burden of the poor and helping in digging wells?
('71', 267, 7, 30, 559699) So I readily consented.
('71', 267, 7, 31, 559723) But I would certainly like it even if you went to the frontier and did something similar.
('71', 267, 7, 32, 559813) I had to leave for Allahabad suddenly, for since Jawaharlal was ill the Working Committee could not be held anywhere else and they required my presence.
('71', 267, 7, 33, 559966) At Sardar's insistence, I am staying in a village called Tithal on the sea coast near Bulsar.

('71', 268, 7, 17, 560995) The weather here is, of course, comparatively cool.
('71', 268, 7, 18, 561047) But it is not favourable for work.
('71', 268, 7, 19, 561082) Here I am having more sleep.
('71', 268, 7, 20, 561111) I just like to go on sleeping.
('71', 268, 7, 21, 561142) All the same the heat of Segaon is certainly not here.
('71', 268, 7, 22, 561197) You, however, should keep yourself cool with wet clothes.
('71', 268, 7, 23, 561255) You did well in sending my letter to Manubhai.
('71', 268, 7, 24, 561302) The spiritual benefit of not coming with me here was evident, for it was also your duty to stay there.
('71', 268, 7, 25, 561405) There was pleasure and fun of a sort in coming with me.
('71', 268, 7, 26, 561461) And one who can deny oneself even such innocent pleasures certainly advances one's spiritual welfare.
('71', 268, 7, 27, 561563) You no doubt have strength of mind.
('71', 268, 7, 28, 561599) You have added to it by not coming.
('71', 268, 7, 29, 561635) Do you see this?
('71', 268, 7, 30, 561652) It is good that you and Indu go with Anna and hear the Gita.
('71', 268, 7, 31, 561713) You do well too in helping in milking the cow.
('71', 268, 7, 32, 561760) The penknife could not be traced here, which means that it is lost.

('71', 273, 2, 3, 567338) The reader will find elsewhere an authentic and exhaustive note 1
('71', 273, 3, 4, 567404) on the Koodalmanikkam controversy prepared by Shri G. Ramachandran, Secretary of the Kerala Harijan Sevak Sangh.
('71', 273, 3, 5, 567517) The note is authentic in the sense that it is based purely on official records.
('71', 273, 3, 6, 567597) Add to this note the following from the Kerala Harijan Sevak Sangh's office in Trivandrum:
('71', 273, 4, 7, 567688) In the issue of Harijan of 8th May in the article, "Cochin Travancore" 2 by Mahatmaji, in paragraph three, the following sentences are found: "The pundits of India should dispassionately examine the orders and express their unbiased opinion.
('71', 273, 4, 8, 567930) I am inclined to think that the Travancore Durbar may well invite the opinion of pundits on the single question of the religious propriety of the Cochin order and undertake to abide by their opinion.
('71', 273, 4, 9, 568130) In other words, Travancore may well offer to abide by the verdict of an arbitration tribunal consisting of unbiased pundits who will be universally accepted as such.
('71', 273, 4, 10, 568296) The opinion of an assembly of such pundits would be the nearest approach to an arbitration tribunal.
('71', 273, 4, 11, 568397) For, whilst the Travancore Durbar had a perfect right to open to Harijans the temples within their sole jurisdiction and ownership and without reference to the opinion of pundits, it would hardly be right to propound a new Smriti in respect of temples where there is joint jurisdiction." I am herewith forwarding a true copy of a judgment of the Chief Court of Cochin which discusses the Kaimal's position with regard to the Koodalmanikkam Temple.
('71', 273, 4, 12, 568845) This judgment shows the Kaimal to be the supreme spiritual authority in all matters connected with that Temple, and therefore the opinion of the pundits in this instance seems to be unnecessary.
('71', 273, 4, 13, 569040) These enable the reader to form his own judgment as to the propriety or otherwise of the action of the Cochin Durbar.
('71', 273, 4, 14, 569158) If the note and the Cochin Court judgment are to be trusted, evidently the Cochin Durbar's action was wholly wrong.
('71', 273, 4, 15, 569274) This is not to say that the Kaimal's action was right in the religious sense.
('71', 273, 4, 16, 569352) But if it was not, the only course open to the Cochin Durbar was to reason with the Kaimal, notKaimal, not to force his hands as was done.
('71', 273, 4, 17, 569491) The Kaimal evidently becomes the supreme and final authority on spiritual matters after his appointment by the Travancore Durbar.
('71', 273, 4, 18, 569621) Like the king he can do no wrong.
('71', 273, 4, 19, 569655) But even he may not long resist the opinion of his peers.
('71', 273, 4, 20, 569713) And the only way the Cochin Durbar or anyone else can influence the

('71', 274, 1, 2, 569921) Kaimals judgment is, I presume, by evoking the opinion of pundits learned in spiritual matters.
('71', 274, 1, 3, 570017) And legally speaking even their opinion has no binding effect on the Kaimal.

('71', 274, 2, 5, 570113) 304. RELIGIOUS OATH AND NON RELIGIOUS
('71', 274, 3, 6, 570151) Shri Shivaprasad Gupta, the great philanthropist of Benares, writes:
('71', 274, 4, 7, 570220) After hearing the Harijan of May 1st read to me, I have been pondering over the note Gandhi Seva Sangh and Legislatures.
('71', 274, 4, 8, 570341) I reread it today, I also read the Weekly Letter, but I could not give rest to the surging thought rising in my mind.
('71', 274, 5, 9, 570459) The last paragraph 1 of the note reads: It is not a religious oath, so far as I understand the Constitution, and it is wholly consistent with the demand for immediate and concrete independence." The following are the questions that arise in my mind:
('71', 274, 6, 10, 570709) 1. Are oaths of several and different kinds?
('71', 274, 6, 11, 570754) 2. Can an oath taken in the name of God, or in the alternative form where one has to affirm solemnly, be classed in two categories, religious oath and non religious oath?
('71', 274, 6, 12, 570925) 3. What is the governing idea behind a non religious oath?
('71', 274, 6, 13, 570984) 4. How can an oath of allegiance to the person of a king be consistent with the demand for immediate and concrete independence?
('71', 274, 6, 14, 571112) This demand, at least to me, means depriving the same sovereign of his sovereignty.
('71', 274, 7, 15, 571196) I would very much like your answer to these pertinent questions.
('71', 274, 7, 16, 571261) My answer to the first and the second questions is Yes.
('71', 274, 7, 17, 571317) The answer to the other two questions may be gathered from what follows.
('71', 274, 7, 18, 571390) An oath may be taken in the name of God and yet may not be styled religious.
('71', 274, 7, 19, 571467) An oath that a witness takes in a court of law is a legal not a religious oath, breach of which would carry legal consequences.
('71', 274, 7, 20, 571595) An oath taken by Members of Parliament may be called a constitutional not a religious oath, breach of which may involve mundane consequences.
('71', 274, 7, 21, 571737) Breach of a religious oath carries no legal consequences, but in the opinion of the taker does carry divine punishment.
('71', 274, 7, 22, 571857) This does not mean that any of the three varieties of oaths is less binding than the others on a conscientious man.
('71', 274, 7, 23, 571973) A conscientious witness will tell the truth, not for fear of the legal consequence, but he will do so in every case.
('71', 274, 7, 24, 572090) The legislator's oath has
('71', 274, 8, 25, 572116) 1 Vide Sacrifice of Ras, 18 4 1937
('71', 275, 0, 1, 572151) 276 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 275, 1, 2, 572193) an interpretation in terms of the Constitution which prescribes the oath.
('71', 275, 1, 3, 572267) The interpretation may be given in the Constitution itself or may grow up by usage.
('71', 275, 1, 4, 572351) So far as I understand the British Constitution, the oath of allegiance simply means that the legislator will in pushing forward his policy or point conform to the Constitution.
('71', 275, 1, 5, 572529) I hold that it is open to the legislator consistently with his oath under the British Constitution to adopt measures in the Legislature for complete independence.
('71', 275, 1, 6, 572692) That to my mind is the saving grace of the British Constitution.
('71', 275, 1, 7, 572757) I fancy that the members of the Union Parliament of South Africa take substantially the same oath as the members in India, but it is open to that Parliament today to declare complete independence without any violation of the oath of allegiance.
('71', 275, 1, 8, 573002) It is because I have a profound conviction that the British Constitution in theory permits of the fulfilment of the highest ambition of an individual or the nation of which he is a member that I advised the Workiing Committee to accept my formula for office acceptance.
('71', 275, 1, 9, 573272) And it is in the same conviction that I am struggling to get the British Government to respond to it.
('71', 275, 1, 10, 573374) I am painfully conscious that they would prolong the agony to the breaking point.
('71', 275, 1, 11, 573456) But I know that if we have faith and grit we shall win at every point and reach our goal without shedding a drop of blood.
('71', 275, 1, 12, 573579) The British people apply the same laws to the game of politics that they apply to the game of football which I believe is their invention.
('71', 275, 1, 13, 573718) They give no quarter to the opponent and ask for none.
('71', 275, 1, 14, 573773) The fundamental difference in our case is that we have abjured the use of arms.
('71', 275, 1, 15, 573853) This has confounded them.
('71', 275, 1, 16, 573879) They do not believe our protestations.
('71', 275, 1, 17, 573918) They do not mind our agitation for complete independence so long as we keep it within the constitutional limit.
('71', 275, 1, 18, 574030) What else can the legislators do or are they to do inside their Assemblies?
('71', 275, 1, 19, 574106) They may not take there pistols in their pockets.
('71', 275, 1, 20, 574156) That would be a flagrant breach of the oath and also the law.
('71', 275, 1, 21, 574218) Shri Shivaprasad Gupta need not worry himself over the propriety of the oath by Congressmen.
('71', 275, 1, 22, 574311) If the agitation for complete independence was inconsistent with the oath, surely the British Government themselves would have raised that preliminary objection even to the candidature of Congressmen.

('71', 276, 9, 13, 575085) MAY 22, 1937
('71', 276, 10, 14, 575098) DEAR DR.
('71', 276, 10, 15, 575107) HARDIKER, I got your letter 3 yesterday.
('71', 276, 10, 16, 575148) My opinion is that you should confer with the Provincial Committee there and on its agreeing you should take possession subject to the protest that the Seva Dal for whose work the building was constructed still remains under the ban.
('71', 276, 10, 17, 575382) Before you consult the Committee it might be as well to ascertain from the Government whether the delivery of the buildings is to mean the lifting of the ban on the Dal.
('71', 276, 10, 18, 575552) By the time the possessions is taken,

('71', 276, 11, 21, 575870) The building and other movable property used as training camp for the Seva Dal volunteers were attached by the Government in 1932. The property which belonged to A.I.C.C. was transferred to Karnataka Provincial Congress Committee in 1931, after Seva Dal's recognition as a subordinate body of the Congress.
('71', 276, 11, 22, 576177) The addressee was doubtful of the use of the building as the ban on Seva Dal had not yet been lifted.

('71', 277, 5, 9, 576622) PRABHA, I got your letter.
('71', 277, 5, 10, 576649) Don't ruin your health.
('71', 277, 5, 11, 576673) It is good that you paid a visit to Hazaribagh.

('71', 277, 5, 13, 576807) I didn't send for you at Allahabad because I thought Jaya prakash might not like it.
('71', 277, 5, 14, 576892) I would not like to displease him unnecessarily.
('71', 277, 5, 15, 576941) I consider it my duty to respect his wishes as far as possible.
('71', 277, 5, 16, 577005) It is quite proper that you should stay with Father as long as you can.
('71', 277, 5, 17, 577077) You will certainly be a great help to him.
('71', 277, 5, 18, 577120) You should give him courage and tell him that he should not at all worry.
('71', 277, 5, 19, 577194) You should also try to understand why he keeps worrying.
('71', 277, 5, 20, 577251) Why have they called you to Sitab Diara?
('71', 277, 5, 21, 577292) Is Sitab Diara hotter or cooler?
('71', 277, 5, 22, 577325) In which of the two places can you have greater facility regarding vegetables?
('71', 277, 5, 23, 577404) Manu has now gone to Rajkot.
('71', 277, 5, 24, 577433) In Segaon, only Vasumati, Vijaya, Lilavati, Nanavati, Munnalal and Balvantsinha are left now.
('71', 277, 5, 25, 577527) It is quite hot there.

However, in his letter dated July 6, the addressee in formed Gandhiji of his reluctance to take over the building which were found to be in bad shape.
('71', 277, 6, 30, 578057) He had accordingly communicated to the Inspector: ".

('71', 278, 7, 14, 578780) MAY 22, 1937 If we want to impart education best suited to the needs of villagers, we should take the Vidyapith to the villages.
('71', 278, 7, 15, 578909) We should convert it into a training school in order that we might be able to give practical training to teachers in terms of the needs of villagers.
('71', 278, 7, 16, 579059) You cannot instruct the teachers in the needs of villagers through a training school in a city.
('71', 278, 7, 17, 579155) Nor can you so interest them in the condition of villages.
('71', 278, 7, 18, 579214) To interest city dwellers in villages and make them live in them is no easy task.
('71', 278, 7, 19, 579296) I am finding daily confirmation of this in Segaon.
('71', 278, 7, 20, 579347) I cannot give the assurance that our year's stay in Segaon has
('71', 278, 8, 21, 579410) 1 This is extracted from "Weekly Letter" By Mahadev Desai, who had reported: "The convener of the small conference of the teachers in Gujarat national schools which met at Tithal on the 22nd May had sent to the invitees a questionnaire which speaks for itself: 1. What is the education best suited to the needs of our villages and most beneficial to them?
('71', 278, 8, 22, 579766) 2. How to combat mass illiteracy and ignorance?
('71', 278, 8, 23, 579814) 3. Is literacy indispensable for intellectual growth?
('71', 278, 8, 24, 579868) Is the system of starting instruction with teaching the alphabet and reading and writing prejudicial to intellectual growth?
('71', 278, 8, 25, 579993) 4. The need of making vocational training the pivot of all instruction.
('71', 278, 8, 26, 580065) 5. The future of the present national schools.
('71', 278, 8, 27, 580112) 6. The possibility of imparting all education through the mother tongue of the children.
('71', 278, 8, 28, 580201) 7. In what essentials of national education are existing schools lacking?
('71', 278, 8, 29, 580275) 8. The necessity of making Hindi Hindustani compulsory in the early years of primary and secondary education.' On Gandhiji being invited to give his views on these points, he made observations giving individual examples.
('71', 278, 8, 30, 580496) I epitomize them below leaving out the latter, which while they were interesting to the few friends to whom he spoke are of little use to the general reader."
('71', 279, 0, 1, 580655) 280 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 279, 1, 2, 580697) made of us villagers or that we have become one with them for common good.
('71', 279, 1, 3, 580772) Then as to primary education my confirmed opinion is that the commencement of training by teaching the alphabet and reading and writing hampers their intellectual growth.
('71', 279, 1, 4, 580943) I would not teach them the alphabet till they have had an elementary knowledge of history, geography, mental arithmetic and the art (say) of spinning.
('71', 279, 1, 5, 581094) Through these three I should develop their intelligence.
('71', 279, 1, 6, 581151) Question may be asked how intelligence can be developed through the takli or the spinning wheel.
('71', 279, 1, 7, 581248) It can be, to a marvellous degree, if it is not taught merely mechanically.
('71', 279, 1, 8, 581324) When you tell a child the reason for each process, when you explain the mechanism of the takli or the wheel, when you give him the history of cotton and its connection with civilization itself and take him to the village field where it is grown, and teach him to count the rounds he spins and the method of finding the evenness and strength of his yarn, you hold his interest and simultaneously train his hands, his eyes and his mind.
('71', 279, 1, 9, 581759) I should give six months to this preliminary training.
('71', 279, 1, 10, 581814) The child is probably now ready for learning how to read the alphabet, and when he is able to do so rapidly, he is ready to learn simple drawing, and when he has leant to draw geometrical figures and the figures of birds, etc., he will draw, not scrawl, the figures of the alphabet.
('71', 279, 1, 11, 582097) I can recall the days of my childhood when I was being taught the alphabet.
('71', 279, 1, 12, 582173) I know what a drag it was.
('71', 279, 1, 13, 582200) Nobody cared why my intellect was rusting.
('71', 279, 1, 14, 582243) I consider writing as a fine art.
('71', 279, 1, 15, 582277) We kill it by imposing the alphabet on little children and making it the beginning of learning.
('71', 279, 1, 16, 582373) Thus we do violence to the art of writing and stunt the growth of the child when we seek to teach him the alphabet before its time.
('71', 279, 1, 17, 582505) Indeed in my opinion what we have reason to deplore and be ashamed of is not so much illiteracy as ignorance.
('71', 279, 1, 18, 582615) Therefore adult education, too, should have an intensive programme of driving out ignorance through carefully selected teachers with an equally carefully selected syllabus according to which they would educate the adult villager's mind.
('71', 279, 1, 19, 582852) This is not to say that I would not give them a knowledge of the alphabet.
('71', 279, 1, 20, 582927) I value it too much to despise or even belittle its merit as a vehicle of education.
('71', 279, 1, 21, 583012) I appreciate Prof.
('71', 279, 1, 22, 583031) Laubach's immense labours in the way of making the alphabet easy and Prof.
('71', 279, 1, 23, 583106) Bhagwat's great and practical contribution in the same direction.
('71', 279, 1, 24, 583172) Indeed I have invited the latter to come to Segaon whenever he chooses and try his art on the men, women and even children of Segaon.
('71', 279, 1, 25, 583306) As to the necessity and value of regarding the teaching of village handicrafts as the pivot and centre of education I have no

('71', 280, 1, 2, 583475) manner of doubt.
('71', 280, 1, 3, 583492) The method adopted in the institutions in India, I do not call education, i.e., drawing out the best in man, but a debauchery of the mind.
('71', 280, 1, 4, 583631) It informs the mind anyhow, whereas the method of training the mind through village handicrafts from the very beginning as the central fact would promote the real, disciplined development of the mind resulting in conservation of the intellectual energy and indirectly also the spiritual.
('71', 280, 1, 5, 583919) Here, too, I must not be understood to belittle fine arts.
('71', 280, 1, 6, 583978) But I would not misplace them.
('71', 280, 1, 7, 584009) Matter misplaced has been rightly described as dirt.
('71', 280, 1, 8, 584062) In proof of what I am saying, I can only cite the tons of worthless and even indecent literature that is pouring in upon us with the result which he who runs may see.

('71', 280, 3, 11, 584274) Shri Jerajani writes to say: 1
('71', 280, 4, 12, 584305) This suggestion is worth considering, and if a register of customers is maintained at each centre, it is likely to prove useful.
('71', 280, 4, 13, 584434) The only doubt may be regarding its feasibility.
('71', 280, 4, 14, 584483) I would regard it as practical if a complete list could be compiled speedily and at little additional cost.
('71', 280, 4, 15, 584591) A list of workmen poses no difficulties.
('71', 280, 4, 16, 584632) And, ordinarily it may be said that those workmen who are once registered continue to work for good.
('71', 280, 4, 17, 584733) But customers keep changing every day.
('71', 280, 4, 18, 584772) It cannot be said with certainty that the individual who purchases khadi worth one anna today is bound to come back for more.
('71', 280, 4, 19, 584898) However, if the list is to be complete, even such a customer's name must be recorded.
('71', 280, 4, 20, 584984) What is its utility?
('71', 280, 4, 21, 585005) If a list is to be compiled, should it consist only of customers of a certain kind?
('71', 280, 4, 22, 585089) In order that such a list should prove useful, it should be maintained in alphabetical order.
('71', 280, 4, 23, 585183) If this is attempted, it will necessarily entail some expenses.
('71', 280, 4, 24, 585247) Should a list then be made of those who give a certain yearly subscription?
('71', 280, 4, 25, 585323) If this be the case, what benefit do they get out of it?
('71', 280, 4, 26, 585380) As I have no experience in this matter, I can only frame such questions.
('71', 280, 4, 27, 585453) Shri Jerajani's suggestion has been published here in order to invite discussion.

('71', 281, 1, 2, 585770) 311. VERY OLD QUESTIONS
('71', 281, 2, 3, 585794) I have received a letter.
('71', 281, 2, 4, 585820) Its substance is as follows: Our country does not manufacture any dyes.
('71', 281, 2, 5, 585892) But the khadi sold in our country comes in many coloured prints.
('71', 281, 2, 6, 585957) Obviously the dyes used could only be foreign.
('71', 281, 2, 7, 586004) I cannot understand how we can tolerate it.
('71', 281, 2, 8, 586048) India can certainly manufacture its own dyes.
('71', 281, 2, 9, 586094) Why then foreign chemical dyes on a sacred thing like khadi?
('71', 281, 2, 10, 586155) For patriotic reasons khadi is of course best for wearing for Indians but why shouldn't it be as fine as muslin?
('71', 281, 2, 11, 586268) There was a time when India used to produce muslin for the entire world.
('71', 281, 2, 12, 586341) All these three questions were discussed at length when Navajivan was first started.
('71', 281, 2, 13, 586426) Ordinarily such questions are not raised these days.
('71', 281, 2, 14, 586479) As the correspondent desires that replies should be given only through the columns of the Harijanbandhu, I give these here.
('71', 281, 2, 15, 586603) Ever since I accepted khadi as the focal point of swadeshi in the year 1918, I have been repeatedly saying that we should keep the pledge of swadeshi not because we hate what is foreign but because the welfare of the country is rooted in swadeshi.
('71', 281, 2, 16, 586851) Hence we should certianly accept those foreign products which we cannot produce immediately, which are needed by the country and the introduction of which would not harm the country in any way.
('71', 281, 2, 17, 587045) Everyone can think of examples of such foreign goods.
('71', 281, 2, 18, 587099) Regarding the propagation of khadi, the question of using [foreign] dyes arose at the very outset.
('71', 281, 2, 19, 587198) The Spinners' Association did not exist at that time.
('71', 281, 2, 20, 587252) I had given the opinion that wherever indigenous dyes were not available, there should be no bar to using foreign ones.
('71', 281, 2, 21, 587372) But the utmost effort should be made for producing the best possible indigenous dyes.
('71', 281, 2, 22, 587458) The same policy continues even now.
('71', 281, 2, 23, 587494) Experiments with indigenous dyes are being made and they are being used whenever it is convenient to do so.
('71', 281, 2, 24, 587602) The needs of those who would not use foreign dyes are met by white khadi.
('71', 281, 2, 25, 587676) The propaganda for khadi is not for its own sake, nor is it unthinking.
('71', 281, 2, 26, 587748) The following is the trend of thought behind the khadi shastra.
('71', 281, 2, 27, 587812) If Indians use nothing but khadi, crores of women spinners, carders, washermen, dyers and such other persons could get a livelihood; and crores of rupees will remain in the country and go into the pockets of half starved and wholly or partially unemployed
('71', 282, 0, 1, 588068) VOL.71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 283
('71', 282, 1, 2, 588111) villagers.
('71', 282, 1, 3, 588122) The Spinners Association by investing a negligible amount of capital has to date put almost three and a half crores of rupees into the pockets of such artisans.
('71', 282, 1, 4, 588283) Had these earnings gone to a hundred or two or even ten or twenty thousand persons in cities, it would have been announced by the beating of drums.
('71', 282, 1, 5, 588431) But no one is surprised because this amount has found its way without any fanfare, into the homes of hundreds of thousands of starving villagers.
('71', 282, 1, 6, 588577) But I regard it as a minor miracle.
('71', 282, 1, 7, 588613) No one is deprived of his livelihood by the use of foreign dyes, no new industry is prevented from coming up because of this and khadi has been given an impetus.
('71', 282, 1, 8, 588775) I do believe that chemical dyes can be made in India but that is a distinct and independent industry.
('71', 282, 1, 9, 588877) However, it is the dharma of the wealthy to take up that venture.
('71', 282, 1, 10, 588943) Such risks are beyond the scope of a khadi worker.
('71', 282, 1, 11, 588994) Even today mill like khadi is produced in sufficient quantity to meet the demand.
('71', 282, 1, 12, 589076) Even the patolas 1 of Patan are available today if anyone wished to wear them.
('71', 282, 1, 13, 589155) But there are few such generous persons who would pay the price.
('71', 282, 1, 14, 589220) If anyone expects that the same quality of khadi should be available at a price comparable to mill made mull, I would tell him that it is impossible, and it should be impossible, to have hand made mull without the use of force against the workmen.

('71', 284, 1, 6, 591396) In spite of my regarding dogs and human beings as equal, I cannot feel the same in respect of illness of dogs as of men.
('71', 284, 1, 7, 591517) But I hope for your sake that he is fully restored.
('71', 284, 1, 8, 591569) The moral from this domestic illness may be that you cannot serve man and dogs at the same time and therefore dogs should not be kept as pets.

('71', 284, 6, 21, 592259) Whatever the temptations or pressure, dont break the rules you have accepted for yourself.
('71', 284, 6, 22, 592350) Both of you should daily recite the 12th chapter 1 attentively and ponder over it.
('71', 284, 6, 23, 592433) By now you both must have learnt it by heart.

('71', 285, 3, 5, 592856) But nowadays there is such great pressure of work here that I could not get time to write a long reply.
('71', 285, 3, 6, 592960) You should keep on writing, so that your thoughts may become clear.
('71', 285, 3, 7, 593028) I shall then be able to understand you and guide you better.
('71', 285, 3, 8, 593089) But I will say one thing here.
('71', 285, 3, 9, 593120) My inability to visit Segaon more often has certainly pained me.
('71', 285, 3, 10, 593185) My only consolation was that the cause was not my laziness but inability to get away from other jobs.
('71', 285, 3, 11, 593287) But this is not to deny or extenuate my failure.
('71', 285, 3, 12, 593336) I did not mean that we have not been able to do anything at all.
('71', 285, 3, 13, 593401) But whatever we have done cannot be said to be of much value.
('71', 285, 3, 14, 593463) I am not saying this by way of fault finding.
('71', 285, 3, 15, 593509) But we must think about the future.
('71', 285, 3, 16, 593545) You are, of course, doing that.

('71', 289, 1, 2, 598860) interference by the Governors, since I admit that circumstances could be conceived when intereference would be necessary, if the clause defining special powers of Governors was not abrogated.
('71', 289, 1, 3, 599052) I then said that I did not contemplate an irremovable Ministry except by an adverse vote of the House, but that I contemplated also dismissal byGovernors when a difference arose between them and their Ministers, which could not be got over by any reasoning.
('71', 289, 1, 4, 599310) I perferred dismissal to voluntary resignation becuase I wanted the burden of dismissal to rest on Governors shoulders.
('71', 289, 1, 5, 599430) That would check or minimize opposition pinpricks and make the working of offices by a party which is frankly opposed to the Act and the British Imperial system tolerably smooth.
('71', 289, 1, 6, 599609) Now, if the difference between dismissal and what Lord Zetland has offered is very little, surely it is up to the Government to make up the difference rather than for the Congress to yield.
('71', 289, 1, 7, 599799) To show that my original position is not [at] all altered, I would be entirely satisfied if assurances were given as was contemplated by the resolution of the A. I. C. C. The latest resolution of the Working Committee is but an interpretation of the A. I. C. C. resolution, not an advance or impro vement on it.

('71', 290, 3, 6, 601052) I saw no fault in your conduct towards Manu.
('71', 290, 3, 7, 601097) How could you help if you came to like her?
('71', 290, 3, 8, 601141) You put the proposal before me in a manner befitting a young man.
('71', 290, 3, 9, 601207) I dont think that you violated propriety in any way by doing so.
('71', 290, 3, 10, 601272) Had I thought that your father would be pleased, I would have certainly suggested your name to Manu and she would have accepted my proposal.
('71', 290, 3, 11, 601413) But, thinking that it would be impossible to obtain Fathers blessings, you suppressed your desire and thereby enhanced yours and the Chhaya familys reputation.
('71', 290, 3, 12, 601573) You may make any use of this letter that you like.
('71', 290, 3, 13, 601624) It is time to think what work you should take up in future.
('71', 290, 3, 14, 601684) We shall do that when we meet.

('71', 290, 10, 21, 601869) What do we know?
('71', 290, 10, 22, 601886) Rama didnt know that he would have to go to the forest.
('71', 290, 10, 23, 601942) Send Amtul Salaam.
('71', 290, 10, 24, 601961) We will not give insulin and still cure diabetes.

('71', 291, 3, 4, 602217) NANAVATI, I got your letter after a long time.
('71', 291, 3, 5, 602264) Nimu has been here for the last five days.
('71', 291, 3, 6, 602307) For the present she will stay here.
('71', 291, 3, 7, 602343) Nothing is decided about the future.
('71', 291, 3, 8, 602380) If you have made up your mind to spend the whole summer in Segaon, then reduce your work and sleep at least for ten hours daily, full eight hours at night and full two hours during the day, either at one stretch or piecemeal.
('71', 291, 3, 9, 602606) The weight must remain constant.
('71', 291, 3, 10, 602639) The cause of the pain is obviously weakness.
('71', 291, 3, 11, 602684) I hope you are taking hip baths regularly.

('71', 291, 9, 20, 603020) I shall enquire from Munnalal about milk.
('71', 291, 9, 21, 603062) Your argument seems to be quite correct.
('71', 291, 9, 22, 603103) I will not turn you out or anyone else.
('71', 291, 9, 23, 603143) But I will not stop those who go away of their own accord.
('71', 291, 9, 24, 603202) I shall extract from everyone as much work as possible.
('71', 291, 9, 25, 603258) Although all are engaged in something or other, according to me it is still not sufficient.
('71', 291, 9, 26, 603350) Never to give up even at the cost of life is also one of my mottos.
('71', 291, 9, 27, 603418) To dismiss everyone after having permitted them to stay would be to admit defeat and prove oneself a fool.
('71', 291, 9, 28, 603525) I dont mind looking a fool as I already am one but this will certainly be painful.
('71', 291, 9, 29, 603608) So how can I stand discomfiture?

('71', 292, 3, 4, 603846) Revered Bapujis instructions are that if the thread snaps while spinning it should be joined rather than thrown away.
('71', 292, 3, 5, 603964) It will lessen the wastage.
('71', 292, 3, 6, 603992) The best thing would be to spin in such a way that there would be no occasion for joining.
('71', 292, 3, 7, 604083) Usually the thread snaps only because of its unevenness.
('71', 292, 3, 8, 604140) There will not be any wastage if as soon as the thread becomes thinner than usual, the sliver is broken off and put along with the thin thread and spun again.
('71', 292, 3, 9, 604299) Professional spinners follow this method.

('71', 292, 7, 15, 604539) Jawaharlals letter to Ammu is inoffensive.
('71', 292, 7, 16, 604582) It wont do for women to have tender skin.
('71', 292, 7, 17, 604624) His viewpoint should be appreciated.
('71', 292, 7, 18, 604661) You were right in not circulating the letter.
('71', 292, 7, 19, 604707) It may be read, if necessary, at some meeting where you can watch and correct misunderstanding.
('71', 292, 7, 20, 604803) But just as it is necessary to understand his viewpoint, it is also necessary for you to recognize your limitations.
('71', 292, 7, 21, 604920) You stand midway between two forces.
('71', 292, 7, 22, 604957) You will therefore never become a democratic organization.
('71', 292, 7, 23, 605016) 2 Perhaps your title is a misnomer.
('71', 292, 7, 24, 605052) You may retain it but define your limitations.
('71', 292, 7, 25, 605099) This theme can be further considered whenwe meet in July.
('71', 292, 7, 26, 605157) (Is it not?) I hope the pin head has closed from the bottom.
('71', 292, 7, 27, 605218) I am hoping that you will meet Kallenbach.

('71', 293, 3, 4, 605578) VIJAYA, You have given your daily programme in sufficient detail.
('71', 293, 3, 5, 605644) It is fine.
('71', 293, 3, 6, 605656) It is through selfishness that you are grieving over grandmothers death.
('71', 293, 3, 7, 605729) Her house had become dilapidated.
('71', 293, 3, 8, 605763) Should she, even then, continue to stay in it merely for serving others?
('71', 293, 3, 9, 605836) Why should you envy her if she goes to live in a new house?
('71', 293, 3, 10, 605896) Just because we do not know the meaning of death, through our selfishness we grieve over it.
('71', 293, 3, 11, 605989) If you understand this simple truth, then you will give up crying.
('71', 293, 3, 12, 606056) I have had two letters from Manubhai.
('71', 293, 3, 13, 606094) I have preserved them for you.
('71', 293, 3, 14, 606125) I intended to show them to you when I return there.
('71', 293, 3, 15, 606177) But if you have lost patience, then let me know and I shall send them immediately by return of post.
('71', 293, 3, 16, 606278) I have presumed that you are not impatient in such matters.
('71', 293, 3, 17, 606338) I, therefore, did not send them immediately when they were received and today also I am not sending them.
('71', 293, 3, 18, 606444) Now I will do as you wish.
('71', 293, 3, 19, 606471) I hope you have regained your normal health.

('71', 293, 8, 23, 606657) May 27, 1937
('71', 293, 9, 24, 606670) MUNNALAL, I cannot cope with your letters.
('71', 293, 9, 25, 606713) I go on replying as replies to your questions occur to me.
('71', 293, 9, 26, 606772) You have not at all been at fault in reminding me that I have hardly been able to go to the town.
('71', 293, 9, 27, 606870) Your motive was pure.
('71', 293, 9, 28, 606892) You have yourself understood my helplessness and thereby proved the justice of your criticism.
('71', 293, 9, 29, 606987) What does Balvantsinha write about milk?
('71', 293, 9, 30, 607028) I think that he should be given as much separated milk for the cows as he needs.
('71', 293, 9, 31, 607109) What could be your reason for refusing?
('71', 293, 9, 32, 607149) It is certainly good that the he goat was saved.
('71', 293, 9, 33, 607198) But I cannot accept, without knowing more facts, that your

('71', 294, 1, 2, 607300) intention of going on a fast was true satyagraha.
('71', 294, 1, 3, 607350) Sometimes satyagraha seems to fail and duragraha 1 seems to succeed.
('71', 294, 1, 4, 607419) Still satyagraha remains satyagraha and duragraha remains duragraha.
('71', 294, 1, 5, 607488) In other words, we can judge nothing from the results.
('71', 294, 1, 6, 607543) The counsel You have no right to the fruit 2 should always be kept in mind.
('71', 294, 1, 7, 607619) The relations with Jamnalalji and his house [at Segaon] should be no obstacle.
('71', 294, 1, 8, 607698) It all depends on the manner in which we use them.
('71', 294, 1, 9, 607749) We do hope that we shall always use them for a good purpose.
('71', 294, 1, 10, 607810) The meaning you have given of the Gita verse will do for you personally, but it assumes belief in the Divine incarnation of Krishna.
('71', 294, 1, 11, 607943) People cannot recognize me because I am in the form of a human being. 3 This statement is taken to refer to Krishna in human form and not to the God hidden in all beings.
('71', 294, 1, 12, 608114) One is free to believe this.
('71', 294, 1, 13, 608143) The ultimate result of both the meanings is the same.

('71', 294, 7, 20, 608403) But I would like it if you kept yourself bound voluntarily.
('71', 294, 7, 21, 608463) You are, however, entrusting your welfare to me.
('71', 294, 7, 22, 608512) But do I know my own?
('71', 294, 7, 23, 608534) However, I value your faith.
('71', 294, 7, 24, 608563) Even if I make mistakes in guiding you, still because of your faith your welfare is assured.
('71', 294, 7, 25, 608656) I have already written 4 to Munnalal regarding separated milk.
('71', 294, 7, 26, 608719) I think Balvantsinha ought to be given milk.
('71', 294, 7, 27, 608764) But you should ask Munnalal and understand his reason.

('71', 295, 3, 16, 609747) A thing is certainly a sin for him to whom it appears so and he should wash it off as soon as possible.
('71', 295, 3, 17, 609851) You may use the remaining amount.
('71', 295, 3, 18, 609885) For the future, both of you should have trust in God.

('71', 295, 7, 28, 610465) Since he wishes to leave Vijapur, I casually suggested why he shouldnt go to Rajkot.
('71', 295, 7, 29, 610550) Sharda replied to the question saying that that was the last place he would go to.
('71', 295, 7, 30, 610633) This reminded me of the ill feeling between you two.
('71', 295, 7, 31, 610686) On my asking whether that was the only reason, she said, Yes.
('71', 295, 7, 32, 610748) I thereupon, wrote 2 to Chimanlal admonishing him why two old inmates of the Ashram, whose relation should be closer than that of two brothers, should harbour such ill feeling?

('71', 296, 5, 16, 611550) I think he is a nice young man.
('71', 296, 5, 17, 611582) There seems to be nothing wrong in what he has written and what he believes.
('71', 296, 5, 18, 611659) So there is no need to harp on it.

('71', 296, 5, 20, 611817) Your need at present appears to be urgent as Raghunandan requires assistance in the Press.
('71', 296, 5, 21, 611908) But in my opinion you should let Deka gain full experience.
('71', 296, 5, 22, 611968) He will then be more useful.
('71', 296, 5, 23, 611997) Satyavatis case is pitiable.
('71', 296, 5, 24, 612026) She mentions her weaknesses; what are they precisely?
('71', 296, 5, 25, 612080) The help granted to her for her convalescence is quite proper.
('71', 296, 5, 26, 612143) But it is difficult to say how far you are qualified to guide her.
('71', 296, 5, 27, 612210) Know that it all depends on your self confidence.
('71', 296, 5, 28, 612260) I am quite partial to her, but she is as wilful as she is courageous.
('71', 296, 5, 29, 612330) It will be for her own good if she listens to you.
('71', 296, 5, 30, 612381) I return her letters.
('71', 296, 5, 31, 612403) I hope Mother is all right.

('71', 297, 2, 3, 612584) TITHAL, BULSAR, May 28, 1937
('71', 297, 3, 4, 612613) NARANDAS, I got your letter.
('71', 297, 3, 5, 612642) I was not concerned with Kamus deserts, but only with her need.
('71', 297, 3, 6, 612706) I do believe that she can afford to pay from her own resources.
('71', 297, 3, 7, 612770) But I couldnt persuade her to do so.
('71', 297, 3, 8, 612807) I didnt like to enter into an argument with her and, therefore, decided to pay her Rs.30. I didnt know about Rs. 10. You read the figure as 30 correctly.
('71', 297, 3, 9, 612961) If you know who pays her Rs. 10, let me know.
('71', 297, 3, 10, 613007) I will write to Kamu.
('71', 297, 3, 11, 613029) I have already written to you concerning.
('71', 297, 3, 12, 613071) 1 Kusum 2 seems to have taken a vow of silence towards me.

('71', 297, 7, 18, 613284) The reader will find a fair notice in Mahadev Desais Weekly Letter of the opening to Harijans of its important temple by the ruler of Lathi State.
('71', 297, 7, 19, 613431) The event is of great value to Kathiawar.
('71', 297, 7, 20, 613473) And Thakoresaheb Prahladsinghiji deserves the congratulations of all lovers of Hinduism and humanity.
('71', 297, 7, 21, 613575) Published reports show that there was not a murmur against the act and that the savarna Hindus partook in the proceedings without any reserve.
('71', 297, 7, 22, 613718) I draw from this the same inference I drew from the Travancore Proclamation.
('71', 297, 7, 23, 613795) For the people religious proclamations of a ruler have the sanction of Smritis.
('71', 297, 7, 24, 613875) I am unable on any other basis to account for the unanimous welcome extended to the generous action of the Thakoresaheb of Lathi.
('71', 297, 7, 25, 614005) I have bitter experiences of the obstinacy of the savarnas of Lathi.
('71', 297, 7, 26, 614074) They would not come to the Harijan quarters.
('71', 297, 7, 27, 614119) There was difficulty in getting medical attendance for a Harijan woman who was dying of

('71', 298, 1, 2, 614308) pneumonia.
('71', 298, 1, 3, 614319) There were distinctions observed at the State dispensary.
('71', 298, 1, 4, 614377) It must be said in passing that these disabilities were not peculiar to Lathi, they were common to all parts of Kathiawar and outside it in Gujarat.
('71', 298, 1, 5, 614526) Indeed in some vital matters untouchability is worse in Gujarat than elsewhere and worst in Kathiawar.
('71', 298, 1, 6, 614629) Nor do I imagine that with the opening of the temple in Lathi all the disabilities have disappeared in practice.
('71', 298, 1, 7, 614742) Nevertheless in the ready co operation of the savarna Hindus in the worthy action of the Thakoresaheb of Lathi, as in Travancore, one finds a quick solution of the untouchability problem.
('71', 298, 1, 8, 614930) For if my reasoning is sound, the other Indian chiefs have but to copy the examples of Travancore and Lathi and untouchability will lose its sharp edge, even though it may not die out altogether inthe States of India.
('71', 298, 1, 9, 615148) And if it does on that large scale, British India cannot but be affected by the phenomenon.
('71', 298, 1, 10, 615240) One fails to see, why the princes move so slowly in this matter which is one of life and death to a large portion of Hindu humanity.
('71', 298, 1, 11, 615373) Would that the princes recognized their obvious duty of purging Hinduism of the virus of untouchability and took timely action.
('71', 298, 1, 12, 615501) The Thakoresaheb of Lathi is reported to have said in his address that as soon as he gets suitable priests and teachers he would like to open more temples and cover them with schools for all classes of children.
('71', 298, 1, 13, 615713) I would suggest to him the same remedy I put before the authorities in Travancore.
('71', 298, 1, 14, 615796) A small training schoold should be opened in Lathi for giving practical training in conducting services and schools in temples.
('71', 298, 1, 15, 615924) There is no reason why both the offices should not be combined in one person.
('71', 298, 1, 16, 616002) A school master has as much need to be pure in heart as a priest and vice versa.
('71', 298, 1, 17, 616083) Nor need a priest be ignorant of the art of teaching.
('71', 298, 1, 18, 616137) At the present moment the most deplorable thing is that the temple priests are as a rule ignorant men often devoid of character.
('71', 298, 1, 19, 616266) The training course need not be longnot beyond six months.
('71', 298, 1, 20, 616325) If the salaray offered is attractive, the school should draw well read youths of character beyond reproach.
('71', 298, 1, 21, 616433) My suggestion no doubt implies that the reform of Lathi has its root in spirituality.

('71', 299, 2, 3, 616606) TITHAL, BULSAR, May 29, 1937
('71', 299, 3, 4, 616635) MY DEAR IDIOT, I have already told you I leave here 10th June, reach Segaon 12th June, not to leave it (D.V.) till the meeting of the Haripura Congress.
('71', 299, 3, 5, 616788) So I expect you in July and thereafter you will take your seconds, minutes or hours whatever you can get and have advice, guidance, and orders at your wish!
('71', 299, 3, 6, 616945) Yes, Kumarappa does feel that his interpretation was right and mine wholly wrong and misleading and when he told me that Bahadurji had agreed with him, I told him I must have his opinion in writing.
('71', 299, 3, 7, 617144) He said he would get it.
('71', 299, 3, 8, 617169) I do not know what happened after.
('71', 299, 3, 9, 617204) I still maintain that he has no legal sense.
('71', 299, 3, 10, 617249) But what does that matter?
('71', 299, 3, 11, 617276) He has good sense, he is a faithful worker.
('71', 299, 3, 12, 617320) I would therefore be pleased if he proves to be right in his interpretation.
('71', 299, 3, 13, 617397) I shall then have to blow out my legal brain which people thought I had.
('71', 299, 3, 14, 617470) Your pin head is an eternal pin prick for me.
('71', 299, 3, 15, 617516) You must not neglect it.
('71', 299, 3, 16, 617541) You must worry Shummys life out of him and get it right, your preocupations notwithstanding.
('71', 299, 3, 17, 617634) Your dal is also a pin head.
('71', 299, 3, 18, 617663) I speak not from prejudice but experience.
('71', 299, 3, 19, 617706) You cannont judge results from what ordinarily healthy men can eat seemingly without harm.
('71', 299, 3, 20, 617797) I tell you a tea spoonful of dal has been known to upset delicate stomachs and yours is extra delicate.
('71', 299, 3, 21, 617901) You do get enough protein from your milk and chapati when you take enough.
('71', 299, 3, 22, 617976) I wish you would consult Menkel 1, the food specialist.
('71', 299, 3, 23, 618032) I am not sure of the spelling of his name.
('71', 299, 3, 24, 618075) I would be sorry if you miss meeting Kallenbach.
('71', 299, 3, 25, 618124) He has no desire to see anything in India.
('71', 299, 3, 26, 618167) He has come just to be with me as long as he can.
('71', 299, 3, 27, 618217) He is not sure how long he can stay.
('71', 299, 3, 28, 618254) Although he has become a big architect and his firm has four branches employing 35 architects, he remains in his personal life just as simple as when I left him in 1914. I hope you have the lace from Bombay.

('71', 300, 2, 3, 618679) May 29, 1937
('71', 300, 3, 4, 618692) PREMA, I shall not probably be able to reply to the whole of your letter.
('71', 300, 3, 5, 618766) I will try, though.
('71', 300, 3, 6, 618786) I have certainly issued no order forbidding you to make speeches.
('71', 300, 3, 7, 618852) And even if I have issued any, I withdraw it.
('71', 300, 3, 8, 618898) I wish to order no one.
('71', 300, 3, 9, 618922) What can I have to say if your views change?
('71', 300, 3, 10, 618967) You will follow your nature, as everybody should do.
('71', 300, 4, 11, 619020) The fact that pure love doesnt care for touch certainly doesnt mean that all touch is impure.
('71', 300, 4, 12, 619114) I had pure love for my mother, but Iused to massage her legs when they ached.
('71', 300, 4, 13, 619192) There was no impurity in that touch.
('71', 300, 4, 14, 619229) Touch prompted by lust is evil.
('71', 300, 4, 15, 619261) I would, therefore, say that anybody who says that pure love is impossible without touch doesnt know what pure love is.
('71', 300, 4, 16, 619381) I still do not understand what you wish to suggest regarding Nariman.
('71', 300, 4, 17, 619451) Who did him injustice and how?
('71', 300, 4, 18, 619482) At least for the sake of truth you should come out frankly with what you have in mind.
('71', 300, 4, 19, 619569) I find it intolerable that there should be a difference of opinion between us in a matter like this.
('71', 300, 4, 20, 619670) If you are convinced that injustice has been done to Nariman, you should prove that to me, for, though unwillingly, I had to interest myself in the affair.
('71', 300, 4, 21, 619826) I have, moreover, assured Nariman that I shall be ready to study his case whenever he wishes.
('71', 300, 4, 22, 619920) But whether or not he comes, your duty is clear.
('71', 300, 5, 23, 619969) What you have assumed regarding .
('71', 300, 5, 24, 620003) 2 is not correct.
('71', 300, 5, 25, 620021) The evidence which you have got is of no value.
('71', 300, 5, 26, 620069) Before believing in such a thing you should ask the person concerned.
('71', 300, 5, 27, 620139) I dont wish to suggest that no such untruth has been practised.
('71', 300, 5, 28, 620203) But the matter should be carefully investigated.
('71', 300, 5, 29, 620252) If somebody tells me that Prema did a certain thing, should I believe it without asking you whether it is correct?
('71', 300, 6, 30, 620367) Maybe what you said at Hudli came from your heart.
('71', 300, 6, 31, 620418) But what you said in your speech was different from what you say now.
('71', 300, 6, 32, 620488) Will you admit this much?
('71', 300, 6, 33, 620514) Be that as it may, I have told you that my experience was different from your reasoning.

('71', 301, 7, 8, 620986) LILAVATI, I got your letter.
('71', 301, 7, 9, 621015) Did I say that when I wrote a letter to anybody in Segaon, there would always be a letter for you, too, along with it?
('71', 301, 7, 10, 621134) If I have said that, you should regard it as impossible.
('71', 301, 7, 11, 621191) For, sometimes I may have to write only two lines to somebody, and I cannot decide in advance that I must write to you even when I have hardly time for that.
('71', 301, 7, 12, 621349) But it has certainly been the case that I have written the largest number of letters to you and not a single week has passed without my dictating one to you.
('71', 301, 7, 13, 621507) I think there has never been a gap of more than two days.
('71', 301, 7, 14, 621565) You can find out the number from the diary.
('71', 301, 7, 15, 621609) It will certainly be good if you can stay without ruining your health.
('71', 301, 7, 16, 621680) I dont feel the heat as much as the others do.
('71', 301, 7, 17, 621727) Perhaps it is because I keep moving about and do not have to sit near the stove.
('71', 301, 7, 18, 621808) So how can I feel the heat?
('71', 301, 7, 19, 621836) But now it is decided.

('71', 303, 17, 17, 624481) NARANDAS, I got your letter.
('71', 303, 17, 18, 624510) I understand what you say regarding Chimanlal.
('71', 303, 17, 19, 624557) I am sending your note to him.
('71', 303, 17, 20, 624588) What else but a misunderstanding can there be behind this?
('71', 303, 17, 21, 624647) I have deliberately placed Kamalas burden on you.
('71', 303, 17, 22, 624697) I dont believe anybody else to be capable of shouldering it.
('71', 303, 17, 23, 624758) Read my letter to her.
('71', 303, 17, 24, 624781) Decide for yourself in regard to anything she demands and inform me after taking necessary action, so that if I have any comment to make I may do so.
('71', 303, 17, 25, 624931) Ask me immediately where you have a doubt.
('71', 303, 17, 26, 624974) After knowing all the details from her, give her permission to write letters where you think it

('71', 304, 1, 2, 625113) proper.
('71', 304, 1, 3, 625121) Keep every minute of hers occupied.
('71', 304, 1, 4, 625157) She may study, sew, teach, spin, sweep, carddo everything that her strength permits.
('71', 304, 1, 5, 625242) Point out to her any defect that you may observe in her.
('71', 304, 1, 6, 625299) As regards Kamu I hear that the payment of Rs. 10 will be stopped from this month.
('71', 304, 1, 7, 625382) There was a wire from Vijaya 1 from Chorwad: Send Kanubhai. I have replied: Wishes to stay here till tenth.
('71', 304, 1, 8, 625490) Why do you send for him earlier? What you wrote regarding Kishorelalbhais speech didnt seem to me to call for a reply.
('71', 304, 1, 9, 625609) Personally I see nothing objectionable in the suggestion regarding the addition of cotton seed as a form of subscription for the Goseva Sangh, nor can we find fault withanybody who may spin the whole quantity at a time rather than a little daily.
('71', 304, 1, 10, 625856) It is possible that this will nullify our object in requiring everybody to pay subscription in the same form or some other object as well.
('71', 304, 1, 11, 625995) We need not think that Kishorelal has committed any error because the way he looks at the matter differs from ours in accepting yarn as a form of subscription.
('71', 304, 1, 12, 626155) I dont see anything to criticize in what he has said regarding equal respect for all religions.
('71', 304, 1, 13, 626251) If we see an error in any religion why shouldnt we point it out when occasion demands?
('71', 304, 1, 14, 626338) That we must make sure that the occasion is proper, is a different matter.
('71', 304, 1, 15, 626413) If you have read any other meaning, let me know.

('71', 304, 6, 20, 626601) TITHAL, June 1, 1937 I am very anxious that Congressmen should take office but only if Government show their willingness to conciliate the Congress.
('71', 304, 6, 21, 626750) If, as has been said, Lord Zetland has conceded all but the question of dismissal, the Congress asks Government to come a little way to meet it.
('71', 304, 6, 22, 626895) The conciliatory moves so far have come from the

('71', 305, 0, 1, 626988) 306 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 305, 1, 2, 627030) Congress.
('71', 305, 1, 3, 627040) It would have been easy at Allahabad to close the door by putting a narrow interpretation on the Delhi resolution.
('71', 305, 1, 4, 627155) Instead it was kept open.
('71', 305, 1, 5, 627181) The only obstacle, so far as can at present be seen, is the Congress demand that in the event of serious disagreement between a Governor and his Congress Ministers, the Governor should dismiss them.
('71', 305, 1, 6, 627380) I personally would be satisfied, however, if the Governor gave an undertaking that in such a case he would demand his Ministers resignation.
('71', 305, 2, 7, 627521) Mr. Gandhi refused to agree that it was a small matter for the Congress, because his idea was to make the Governor think fifty times before he took the responsibility of dismissing his Ministers.
('71', 305, 2, 8, 627717) In other words, Mr. Gandhi wished to take advantage of the ordinary human virtueit may be weaknessof not wishing to look a fool.
('71', 305, 2, 9, 627846) Congress critics had said that this demand was merely a trifle.
('71', 305, 2, 10, 627910) [Mr. Gandhi asked:] If it is so, why not give the Congress the trifle?
('71', 305, 3, 11, 627981) In any case, Mr. Gandhi affirmed, the object of the Congress demand was to test the sincerity of British Government.
('71', 305, 3, 12, 628098) Did they want the Congress in office, or did they not?
('71', 305, 3, 13, 628153) In South Africa, Britain meticulously conciliated the Boer.
('71', 305, 3, 14, 628213) In India, however, such a gesture was lacking.
('71', 305, 3, 15, 628260) Indeed all the moves towards solving the impasse had come from the Congress.
('71', 305, 3, 16, 628337) Now the Congress did not demand any legal change.
('71', 305, 3, 17, 628387) But it was being talked at instead of being talked to.
('71', 305, 3, 18, 628442) It would appear that British statesmen and the provincial Governors were addressing the world and not the Congress.
('71', 305, 3, 19, 628558) In fact, they might be accused of attempting as ever to discredit and isolate the Congress.
('71', 305, 4, 20, 628650) If Congressmen took office, they would be doing so with a full sense of their responsibility.
('71', 305, 4, 21, 628744) Therefore, unless the Government recognized its policy of wrecking the Act and achieving independence by constitutional means as perfectly legitimate, they would not welcome the rule of the Congress majority.
('71', 305, 4, 22, 628953) Mr. Gandhi did not see any constitutional obstacle or impropriety in the Viceroy taking steps in an attempt to end the deadlock.
('71', 305, 4, 23, 629082) It was known that the Viceroy had conferred with provincial Governors before they summoned the Congress leaders.
('71', 305, 4, 24, 629195) Surely, then, there was no obstacle to his asking the Congress President to meet him.
('71', 305, 4, 25, 629281) [Mr. Gandhi said:] I do not say that this is necessary.
('71', 305, 4, 26, 629337) It is enough if the Congress demand in accordance with the Allahabad resolution 1 is complied with.
('71', 305, 5, 27, 629437) If Government would not make a gesture, the deadlock must continue.
('71', 305, 5, 28, 629505) The result might in the end be the application of Section 93, that is, the suspension of the

('71', 306, 1, 2, 629709) democratic portion of of the new Constitution.
('71', 306, 1, 3, 629756) Mr. Gandhi was prepared for that and its possible consequences.
('71', 306, 1, 4, 629820) He preferred open oppression under a state of autocracy to veiled oppression of, and interference with, Congress Ministers.
('71', 306, 1, 5, 629944) Though he was ready to face it, oppression was the last thing he desired.
('71', 306, 1, 6, 630018) It would increase the existing bitterness and hatred between Britain and India.
('71', 306, 1, 7, 630098) He himself would die in an effort to prevent the tragedy, but there must come a time when his effort would be fruitless.
('71', 306, 1, 8, 630219) Mr. Gandhi concluded: Nobody has yet said that the present Congress condition for accepting office is unconstitutional.
('71', 306, 1, 9, 630339) The Congress had gone as far as it could, consistent with self esteem and with its avowed object.
('71', 306, 1, 10, 630437) The next move must come from the Government, if they really want the Congress to take office.

('71', 307, 1, 4, 631915) It is not always possible to lay ones hands on the evil that violence works.
('71', 307, 1, 5, 631992) Thus it is not possible to weigh the evil wrought by hanging a murderer, though we may heave a sigh of relief when he is put out.
('71', 307, 1, 6, 632122) Faith would be meaningless, if we were able always to account for everything.

('71', 309, 3, 4, 634453) MUNNALAL, Indu has given me your letters.
('71', 309, 3, 5, 634495) After reading them, I wonder whether to laugh, weep or be angry and I was inclined to do these things in that order and I finally decided not to do any of them.
('71', 309, 3, 6, 634656) I could not follow what Indu told me orally, nor have I been able to judge whose fault it must have been.
('71', 309, 3, 7, 634762) I hope to reach there on the 11th instead of the 12th.
('71', 309, 3, 8, 634817) I shall listen to the story when I come there.
('71', 309, 3, 9, 634864) Or perhaps by that time the cloud might have cleared.
('71', 309, 3, 10, 634918) Therefore I wish to say nothing about the discord.
('71', 309, 3, 11, 634969) Do what you can to settle it among yourselves.
('71', 309, 3, 12, 635016) You have written to me saying that I have thrust on you the burden of winning over Lilavati, Balvantsinha and others.
('71', 309, 3, 13, 635134) If I had put on you the burden of village service for which you and others are in Segaon, you would have been able to carry it.
('71', 309, 3, 14, 635262) But this very distinction that you have made is not proper.
('71', 309, 3, 15, 635322) We have resolved that village service is not different from overcoming anger, etc.The equation would be: To win over Lilavati and others is to overcoming anger and that is equal to serving the villages.
('71', 309, 3, 16, 635525) But so long as you regard them as two separate things, they will remain so from your point of view.
('71', 309, 3, 17, 635625) I have, however, solved this problem, too.
('71', 309, 3, 18, 635668) As I have already told you and Balvantsinha, you can have separate arrangements for your meals, etc.
('71', 309, 3, 19, 635769) You will have to deal only with me.
('71', 309, 3, 20, 635805) You should spend all your time in the service chosen by you.
('71', 309, 3, 21, 635866) After careful thinking, you rejected the suggestion.
('71', 309, 3, 22, 635919) And I also see that you were right in doing so.
('71', 309, 3, 23, 635967) Nobody has ever been able to serve by living in this manner.
('71', 309, 3, 24, 636028) We are not born independent.
('71', 309, 3, 25, 636057) From conception to death we are and will remain dependent on others.

('71', 309, 3, 27, 636175) We will discuss it when we meet and find time.
('71', 309, 3, 28, 636222) You dont have to think what your duty should have been as regards that goat.
('71', 309, 3, 29, 636299) 2 It was simply obstinacy on your part.

('71', 310, 5, 10, 637229) TITHAL, [June] 1 2, 1937
('71', 310, 6, 11, 637254) CHIMANLAL, From your letter I sent to Narandas the portion concerning him.
('71', 310, 6, 12, 637329) He has replied to it.
('71', 310, 6, 13, 637351) What do you say about it?
('71', 310, 6, 14, 637377) I have not shown that letter to Sharda.
('71', 310, 6, 15, 637417) It is likely that being of sharp intellect she may start brooding and become sentimental and even start worrying.
('71', 310, 6, 16, 637531) If I let her read it, I would even have to enter into discussion with her, and that is bound to have an adverse effect on her health.
('71', 310, 6, 17, 637665) All this is not necessary.
('71', 310, 6, 18, 637692) You should, therefore, send your reply directly to me, so that she may not have to get involved in this matter at all.
('71', 310, 6, 19, 637811) I see from Narandass letter that there is nothing but a simple difference of opinion.
('71', 310, 6, 20, 637897) And if it is only a case of honest difference of opinion, there is no reason for unhappiness or anger.
('71', 310, 6, 21, 638000) If you give a reasoned reply meeting every point, send back Narandass letter to me so as to enable me to think over the matter, for I might have forgotten the contents of Narandass letter by the time I get your reply.
('71', 310, 6, 22, 638218) Sharda is keeping good health.
('71', 310, 6, 23, 638249) She takes long walks and eats well.
('71', 310, 6, 24, 638285) On Sunday she weighted 80 lb.
('71', 310, 6, 25, 638315) I consider it a good sign.

('71', 311, 3, 5, 638569) All the people there write to me to have no worry on their account and to stay on in Tithal as long as I wish to.
('71', 311, 3, 6, 638683) And yet they allor rather many of themcreate causes for worry and pass them on to me.
('71', 311, 3, 7, 638769) But I refuse to worry any more.
('71', 311, 3, 8, 638801) I will not leave this place before the 10th instant, though I shall certainly try to leave on the 10th and expect to reach there on the 11th morning.
('71', 311, 3, 9, 638951) And then I shall listen to the various problems, viz., water, milk, the bullock, the cow, the well, the farm and Munnalals fast and give my decision on everything.

('71', 312, 3, 5, 639855) I have never known you to be disrespectful to anybody.
('71', 312, 3, 6, 639910) In the speech referred to there was no disrespect.
('71', 312, 3, 7, 639961) I am surprised Patwardhan thought I had said anything to resent the manner of your speech.
('71', 312, 3, 8, 640052) My remark was directed to the matter.
('71', 312, 3, 9, 640090) I instanced your speech as an act of indiscipline.
('71', 312, 3, 10, 640141) You should not have criticized the action of leaders in pursuance of a mode of action decided upon by the A. I. C. C. I still hold that you were wrong.

('71', 312, 12, 25, 640730) MUNNALAL, Today I am trying to answer several letters of yours.
('71', 312, 12, 26, 640794) Try to analyse and understand the reasons why you worry about Kanchan.
('71', 312, 12, 27, 640865) She is now well settled and studies as much as she can.
('71', 312, 12, 28, 640921) She couldnt be in a better place than where she is at present.
('71', 312, 12, 29, 640984) What then is the point

('71', 313, 1, 2, 641156) in worrying about her?
('71', 313, 1, 3, 641179) Is it that you wish to live with her?
('71', 313, 1, 4, 641217) If that is so, there is no real cause for your worry.
('71', 313, 1, 5, 641271) It is simply a question of your desire.
('71', 313, 1, 6, 641311) If you are trying to curb that desire, we should consider whether you ought to do so.
('71', 313, 1, 7, 641397) The villagers live on jowar and besan 1. You will never be able to copy them in that.
('71', 313, 1, 8, 641483) One should know ones limitations.
('71', 313, 1, 9, 641517) Hence, the reasoning behind your decision to resume solid food is wrong.
('71', 313, 1, 10, 641590) Whether from the economic or the moral point of view, which is economical in the long run for youto eat solid food and fall ill or live on milk which is costlier and work regularly?
('71', 313, 1, 11, 641772) There is only one golden key in being able to live a true life.
('71', 313, 1, 12, 641836) One should plunge into whatever work of service comes to one unsought, surrendering everything to Shri Krishna, and being wholly engrossed in the work.
('71', 313, 1, 13, 641988) Even the thoughts in ones mind should be about how to complete the task and not whether the work is proper or not.
('71', 313, 1, 14, 642103) That we have employed a Bhangi and are building a road is certainly a form of service.
('71', 313, 1, 15, 642190) We are in a position to make people spend money in this way.
('71', 313, 1, 16, 642251) If we dont use our advantage we would prove ourselves fools.
('71', 313, 1, 17, 642312) And, besides, the money is given by the zamindar.
('71', 313, 1, 18, 642362) That we thus make him take interest in the village, though it be indirectly, is no small thing.
('71', 313, 1, 19, 642458) We need not postpone the cleaning of a village and wait for the village people themselves to start doing something.
('71', 313, 1, 20, 642574) If we can melt the heart of the zamindar in every village, our task would be made very much easier.
('71', 313, 1, 21, 642674) However, we have to keep in view all the limbs of society and the limits of each would be the limits of our strength.
('71', 313, 1, 22, 642792) My wish to live alone in Segaon did not mean that it was not possible to enlarge the field of service so long as other people lived there.
('71', 313, 1, 23, 642931) I only wanted to see what one man could do, to see for my own sake whether I could carry on the work by myself.
('71', 313, 1, 24, 643043) The plan could not be carried out and others joined me.
('71', 313, 1, 25, 643099) I must then use their services and they should give them.
('71', 313, 1, 26, 643157) The relations with Jamnalalji should not be allowed to become an obstacle.
('71', 313, 1, 27, 643232) If they make us soft and comfort loving, we would fall off like dried leaves, and that deservedly.
('71', 313, 1, 28, 643331) If we think of nothing but service every hour of the day and strive to remain pure, people will understand us even though a multi millionaire may be living with us.

('71', 314, 1, 2, 643552) I see from your letters that you spend most of your time in dreaming, and that prevents your work from shining out.
('71', 314, 1, 3, 643668) Your motive is pure, but you start running before you have learnt to walk and even while running you dream of flying.
('71', 314, 1, 4, 643786) The result is that you not only do not run or fly but cannot even walk.
('71', 314, 1, 5, 643858) During your illness you could somehow carry on your work, but can you be satisfied with that?
('71', 314, 1, 6, 643952) I have now answered all your letters.
('71', 314, 1, 7, 643990) I kept the letters in front of me and went on consulting them.
('71', 314, 1, 8, 644053) I am sure you do not want me to reply sentence by sentence.
('71', 314, 1, 9, 644113) The foregoing replies will help you to resolve all your difficulties.
('71', 314, 1, 10, 644183) I would, however, advise you to stop thinking in this manner altogether and to complete fully whatever task you have undertaken.
('71', 314, 1, 11, 644312) If you do so, all your problems will solve themselves by and by without any effort on your part and you will be filled with such happiness as you have never known before.

('71', 314, 4, 19, 644807) You rightly jest about Tithal.
('71', 314, 4, 20, 644838) If I have to stay at Tithal for a longer period, do suggest Tithal instead of Bombay.
('71', 314, 4, 21, 644924) When you suggested coming out of the scorching heat of Segaon, did you not mean that you would come only when the weather became cool?
('71', 314, 4, 22, 645059) There was indeed another simpler reason for not giving preference to Tithal.
('71', 314, 4, 23, 645136) But if you want to have any more argument on that point, do so on Friday.
('71', 314, 4, 24, 645210) It is good news that Nanavati has been gaining weight.

('71', 317, 7, 13, 648897) Should I have asked to be made one?
('71', 317, 7, 14, 648933) It is possible that, if I ask for it, Devchandbhai, Narbheram and Prabhashankar would appoint me.
('71', 317, 7, 15, 649031) But should I on that account become a judge?
('71', 317, 7, 16, 649076) It is only in some exceptional cases that I agree to become an arbitrator, and whenever I have done so I have given clearcut decisions.
('71', 317, 7, 17, 649212) But it is outside my field to be an arbitrator.
('71', 317, 7, 18, 649260) My special field is to find a solution by persuading the parties.
('71', 317, 7, 19, 649326) But I do not always succeed in such efforts and, moreover, I have to take considerable pains.
('71', 317, 7, 20, 649420) You should have compassion for me and not put before me complicated cases.
('71', 317, 7, 21, 649495) I would have to spare a lot of time for them.
('71', 317, 7, 22, 649541) How can I manage that?
('71', 317, 7, 23, 649564) Hence I can only put up with your [harsh] opinion.

('71', 318, 3, 5, 649848) In this condition what can you do by staying there 1?
('71', 318, 3, 6, 649902) How much can you do even for the spread of the charkha?
('71', 318, 3, 7, 649958) One wonders whether your living there is the right thing from the point of view of service.

('71', 318, 7, 11, 650150) 371. COCHIN UNTOUCHABILITY A Cochin correspondent writes:
('71', 318, 8, 12, 650208) I have just gone through your article 2 Cochin Travancore in the Harijan, dated May 8, 1937. I find that you have, perhaps unwittingly, done a
('71', 318, 9, 13, 650351) distinct disservice to the cause of truth.
('71', 318, 10, 14, 650394) The controversy about the Koodalmanikkam Temple can in no sense be
('71', 318, 11, 15, 650461) regarded as a war between light and darkness; at any rate, there is not the
('71', 318, 12, 16, 650537) slightest intention among the people of Cochin to hug darkness as a virtue in
('71', 318, 13, 17, 650615) itself, worth putting up a fight for.
('71', 318, 14, 18, 650653) You seem to be labouring under a misapprehension when you say that even the most orthodox Hinduism would hardly permit him (the Cochin Maharaja) to regulate the private conduct of the visitors to the Cochin temples.
('71', 318, 14, 19, 650869) In no temple in India where Harijans are not permitted to worship are trustees authorized to scrutinize the actions of savarna Hindus who are
('71', 318, 15, 20, 651011) entitled, as a matter of right, to visit the temples. So far as the Cochin Government are concerned, they have not sought to regulate the private conduct of visitors to Cochin temples.
('71', 318, 15, 21, 651196) They have also not sought to exercise any scrutiny into the actions of savarna Hindus who are entitled, as a matter
('71', 318, 16, 22, 651312) of right, to visit the temples.
('71', 318, 17, 23, 651344) What they have done is simply to declare as polluted, so far as Cochin temples are concerned, the tantris who have performed religious worship in
('71', 318, 18, 24, 651490) the temples of Travancore thrown open to avarnas.
('71', 318, 18, 25, 651540) There is no sort of ban
('71', 318, 19, 26, 651564) 1 In Nepal 2 Vide Cochin Travancore, 8 5 1937
('71', 319, 0, 1, 651610) 320 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 319, 1, 2, 651652) imposed on entry into Cochin temples of savarna Hindus who have
('71', 319, 2, 3, 651716) worshipped in Travancore temples.
('71', 319, 3, 4, 651750) Even this ban on tantris was imposed by Cochin not because of any spite or malice against a sister State, but solely at the instance of the vaideekans and vadhyars who, from time immemorial, have been recognized and acknowledged as spiritual directors in such matters.
('71', 319, 4, 5, 652019) You observe that in Cochin the Maharaja has interfered in respect of a temple over which he has no exclusive control.
('71', 319, 4, 6, 652137) The Maharaja of Travancore, too, possesses substantial rights over the temple in question.
('71', 319, 4, 7, 652228) The Cochin order is clearly an interference with that right. History, tradition, usage, customall these point to the fact that, while the right of the Maharaja of Travancore in respect of the Koodalmanikkam Temple begins and ends with the nomination of a Thachudaya Kaimal, the Maharaja of Cochin has always exercised, as President of the Yogakkars, enormous powers with regard to its affairs, both spiritual and secular.
('71', 319, 4, 8, 652650) The very fact that the present Kaimal, when the recent troubles arose, solicited advice and guidance from the Maharaja of Cochin shows conclusively enough that the substantial rights alleged to be possessed by Travancore do not include, at any rate, the right to have a voice in the adjudication of spiritual affairs relating to the temple.
('71', 319, 5, 9, 652991) It may interest you, in this connection, to know that in a recent speech at Thiruvalla, Sir C. P. Ramaswami Aiyar, the Dewan of Travancore, admitted that the Travancore Government had no complaint whatever to make in regard to what has happened in the Koodalmanikkam Temple.
('71', 319, 5, 10, 653266) Is this not a proof that Travancore itself does not find any fault with the attitude of Cochin?
('71', 319, 6, 11, 653362) Your suggestion that the opinion of pundits might be invited on the issues involved is certainly one that ought to commend itself to all.
('71', 319, 6, 12, 653500) But how do you justify, I wonder, your appeal in the same breath to the people of Cochin to hold protest meetings against the order of the Maharaja and lead an agitation for throwing open all temples to Harijans?
('71', 319, 6, 13, 653713) Why not wait till the pundits give their opinion at least?
('71', 319, 6, 14, 653772) Whilst the Travancore Durbar had a perfect right to open to Harijans the temples within their sole jurisdiction and ownership and without reference to the opinion of pundits, it would hardly be right to propound a new Smritiin respect of temples where there is joint jurisdiction.
('71', 319, 6, 15, 654053) The Harijan cause must be always and everywhere above suspicion. This is a perfectly sensible position to take up, and we in Cochin would certainly be glad if no attempt is made in Travancore to propound a new Smriti in respect of temples where there is joint jurisdiction.
('71', 319, 6, 16, 654327) I gladly publish this letter.
('71', 319, 6, 17, 654357) The order reffered to of the Mahar aja of Cochin reads as follows: The Maharaja of Cochin is of opinion that proper purificatory ceremonies should be performed in the Koodalmanikkam Temple without any
('71', 320, 0, 1, 654558) VOL.71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 321
('71', 320, 1, 2, 654601) His Highness considers that the temples has been polluted by entry into and participating in ceremonies by persons who have officiated in other temples where the entry of avarnas has been allowed.
('71', 320, 1, 3, 654798) The Maharaja of Cochin has now definitely ordered that any person who has taken part in the conduct of ceremonies in temples which have been polluted by the entry of avarnas thereby becomes polluted and loses the right to enter temples in Cochin until proper prayashchittams are performed.
('71', 320, 1, 4, 655088) Such persons are prohibited from entering temples, touching tanks and wells until they perform the required purificatory ceremonies.
('71', 320, 1, 5, 655221) My note was based upon a summary of the order above quoted.
('71', 320, 1, 6, 655281) There is no mention in it of tantris.
('71', 320, 1, 7, 655319) And are not tantris savarna Hindus?
('71', 320, 1, 8, 655355) My contention was and is that savarna Hindus because they visit or officiate in temples visited by Harijans do not become Harijans.
('71', 320, 1, 9, 655487) But I did err in thinking that the order applied to all savarna Hindus who had visited Travancore temples, whereas it is restricted to those who officiated at Travancore temples.
('71', 320, 1, 10, 655666) Whilst, therefore, I gladly admit the error as to quantity, my argument remains unaffected.
('71', 320, 1, 11, 655758) The Maharaja has surely extended the doctrine of untouchability by regarding savarnas as untouchables because they did not believe in untouchability.
('71', 320, 1, 12, 655908) But the authentic and exhaustive note 1 since published in Harijan disposes of most of the contentions of my correspondent.
('71', 320, 1, 13, 656032) For, according to that note neither the Maharaja of Cochin nor of Travancore has any jurisdiction over the administration of the Koodalmanikkam Temple.
('71', 320, 1, 14, 656184) When, therefore, Sir C. P. Ramaswami Aiyar said that Travancore had no complaint, he merely stated the legal position.
('71', 320, 1, 15, 656303) The only party who has the right and whose duty it is to complain is the Thachudaya Kaimal.
('71', 320, 1, 16, 656395) And one may hope that he will not rest content till he has secured complete freedom from interference with his exclusive right to regulate the admission of worshippers and officiating tantris.
('71', 320, 1, 17, 656588) The correspondent has surely confused the issue by suggesting that my advice to the Hindus of Cochin to agitate for the throwing open of temples to Harijans is inconsistent with my proposal to refer to pundits the question of the legality of declaring, as the Cochin Maharajas order does, savarna Hindus as untouchables.
('71', 320, 1, 18, 656909) And now that it is known that the Maharaja had no right to issue the order he did, the proposed reference becomes unnecessary except as an academic proposition.

('71', 321, 2, 3, 657214) Thakkar Bapa sends me the following statement which he received during his recent tour in the Nizams Dominions:
('71', 321, 3, 4, 657326) About six months ago an event which took place at Karepally, Warangal District, Nizams Dominions, describes the methods adopted by the Christian missionaries to make conversions of Hindus and especially Harijans.
('71', 321, 3, 5, 657539) Some days previous to the appointed date, the village teachers sent out news of the coming event into all the surrounding villages and made sure that the people of all castes of Hindus and especially Harijans were present on the occasion in large numbers.
('71', 321, 3, 6, 657795) Then the pastor arrived at the place bringing with him a girl, about 12 years old, who he said would cure all that were presented to her of all sorts of diseases and also show them the real path of realization of God.
('71', 321, 4, 7, 658013) The pastor then stood and said addressing those present: You believe in
('71', 321, 5, 8, 658085) gods who are dead and gone.
('71', 321, 5, 9, 658113) Your Rama was born, behaved and acted like an
('71', 321, 6, 10, 658159) ordinary mortal and then died.
('71', 321, 6, 11, 658190) So was the case with Krishna also, who had
('71', 321, 7, 12, 658233) many more vices to his credit.
('71', 321, 7, 13, 658264) Here is before you a person who is the very
('71', 321, 8, 14, 658308) incarnation of Christ.
('71', 321, 8, 15, 658331) Christ is in her now, which fact you can verify yourself
('71', 321, 9, 16, 658388) by being cured of your diseases at the mere touch of her hands.
('71', 321, 9, 17, 658452) Why believe in
('71', 321, 10, 18, 658467) gods who are past and no more effective?
('71', 321, 10, 19, 658508) You should all believe in and follow
('71', 321, 11, 20, 658545) the path of Jesus Christ who was born to Virgin Mary, preached the Gospel
('71', 321, 12, 21, 658619) which leads to salvation, died outwardly but rose again on the third day to
('71', 321, 13, 22, 658695) redeem the sinning millions of the world.
('71', 321, 14, 23, 658737) A subscription of one anna per head and two annas for a metal cross were
('71', 321, 15, 24, 658810) charged.
('71', 321, 15, 25, 658819) They were told that unless they wore the cross at all times and
('71', 321, 16, 26, 658883) believed in the truth and efficacy of Christianity, there would not be any good
('71', 321, 17, 27, 658963) effect in the case of diseased patients.
('71', 321, 18, 28, 659004) This happened on two occasions.
('71', 321, 18, 29, 659036) On the third occasion, the Secretary of
('71', 321, 19, 30, 659076) the District Committee and friends visited them and told them that theycould
('71', 321, 20, 31, 659153) preach their religion as they wanted to, but they should not wound the feelings
('71', 321, 21, 32, 659233) of the people by repeating unpleasant things which were not true.
('71', 321, 21, 33, 659299) The local
('71', 321, 22, 34, 659309) police then stopped the proceedings fearing there might be breach of peace in
('71', 321, 23, 35, 659387) the place.
('71', 321, 23, 36, 659398) If it is true, it stands self condemned.
('71', 321, 23, 37, 659439) I would like the Mission concerned to investigate the complaint and throw light on it.

('71', 322, 3, 4, 659662) MANILAL AND SUSHILA, I have liked your letter.
('71', 322, 3, 5, 659709) It is indeed true that my statements contain several implications.
('71', 322, 3, 6, 659776) Therefore, the meaning that you have read is possible.
('71', 322, 3, 7, 659831) But the statement also implies the other meaning that you have suggested.
('71', 322, 3, 8, 659905) Truth need not be made bitter.
('71', 322, 3, 9, 659936) Nor need it be embellished.
('71', 322, 3, 10, 659964) If one person wounds another with a sword and a witness describes the incident, such description by itself is not bitter, though the consequences of the testimony may be bitter for the assailant.
('71', 322, 3, 11, 660160) But that doesnt make truth itself bitter.
('71', 322, 3, 12, 660202) If, however, the description of the assault was full of exaggerations, we might say that truth had been made bitter.
('71', 322, 3, 13, 660319) After saying this, I may add that if I had to make a choice, I would certainly prefer bitter truth to untruth agreeably.
('71', 322, 3, 14, 660440) If, in trying to change bitter into agreeable language, you are likely to kill truth, you had better stick to bitter language.
('71', 322, 3, 15, 660567) You have always been unlucky in the matter of helpers.
('71', 322, 3, 16, 660622) You have never had a really good man.
('71', 322, 3, 17, 660660) But you have got a good helper in Sushila.
('71', 322, 3, 18, 660703) I wonder how you could have managed to pull on if you didnt have her.
('71', 322, 3, 19, 660773) Even from the point of view of self interest, therefore, Sushila must improve her health with good food, exercise and water treatment.
('71', 322, 3, 20, 660908) Mr. Kallenbach has at last arrived.
('71', 322, 3, 21, 660944) He is fine.
('71', 322, 3, 22, 660956) For the present he is here.
('71', 322, 3, 23, 660984) Tithal may be described as a small village about six or seven furlongs from the sea coast.
('71', 322, 3, 24, 661075) We are staying in that village.
('71', 322, 3, 25, 661107) We are leaving on the 10th and shall reach Segaon on the 11th.
('71', 322, 3, 26, 661170) I have just got a letter from Harilal.
('71', 322, 3, 27, 661209) I am enclosing it as a sample.
('71', 322, 3, 28, 661240) I have gone through the Phoenix Trust.
('71', 322, 3, 29, 661279) There is no need to make any changes in it.
('71', 322, 3, 30, 661323) But if you have any suggestion to make, it can perhaps be carried out.
('71', 322, 3, 31, 661394) So it is you who should draft something and send it to me, instead of my drafting anything.
('71', 322, 3, 32, 661486) I had a talk with
('71', 322, 4, 33, 661504) 1 From the postcript it is clear that this letter was completed by Gandhiji after he had received Narandas Gandhis letter about Khushalchand Gandhis death; vide the following two items.

('71', 323, 13, 19, 662529) You are a man of boundless good fortune.

('71', 323, 13, 21, 662690) But you had the good fortune to be by his side when the end came, while I remained here, though this was of course but as it should have been.
('71', 323, 13, 22, 662833) How could I have, yielding to my love, gone there to be by his side?
('71', 323, 13, 23, 662902) It was your dharma to be by his side and you, therefore, took my place.
('71', 323, 13, 24, 662974) You did perfectly right in not forcing medicine into his mouth or permitting them to give him injections during the last hour to enable him to take a few more

('71', 324, 6, 13, 663581) MANUDI, I got your letter.
('71', 324, 6, 14, 663608) You havent used your brains properly.
('71', 324, 6, 15, 663646) Why do you think that it was your aunt who tempted you or that only Surendra could tempt you?
('71', 324, 6, 16, 663740) As soon as you were separated from me, you entered a vast field of temptations.
('71', 324, 6, 17, 663820) You are a very credulous, simple hearted and weak girl.
('71', 324, 6, 18, 663876) All of us are so to some degree.
('71', 324, 6, 19, 663909) That is why we voluntarily raise a hedge in the form of rules round ourselves for our protection.
('71', 324, 6, 20, 664007) I think you have put up a few such hedges.
('71', 324, 6, 21, 664050) I wish, and beg of you, that you should never cross them, no matter who tempts you, whether aunt or husband, mother, father or uncle, or an utter stranger.
('71', 324, 6, 22, 664206) We are leaving this place on the 10th.
('71', 324, 6, 23, 664245) Have you followed my letter?
('71', 324, 6, 24, 664274) Your sitar and shoes have been sent to Bombay with Vasumati.

('71', 325, 1, 3, 664780) Still, since you want it here is one.
('71', 325, 1, 4, 664818) It is good that you get your letters revised by others.
('71', 325, 1, 5, 664874) That will help you to make your thoughts clear if they are confused.
('71', 325, 1, 6, 664943) The words left out by you [and supplied in the revision] will make your meaning clear.
('71', 325, 1, 7, 665030) How jealous of you that while all of you experience heat you dont want me to do that!
('71', 325, 1, 8, 665116) I have made up my mind to return on the 11th.
('71', 325, 1, 9, 665162) Generally it does not rain so early in Wardha and hence I will have some experience of the heat there.
('71', 325, 1, 10, 665265) Since even those who hadnt eaten food from our kitchen had vomiting, we should look for its cause in something other than the food.
('71', 325, 1, 11, 665397) Probably it is water.
('71', 325, 1, 12, 665419) Put some potassium permanganate in the well.
('71', 325, 1, 13, 665464) Store boiled water as before and use it.
('71', 325, 1, 14, 665505) It is also possible that the people had eaten more than they could digest in the excessive heat and that had caused the vomiting.
('71', 325, 1, 15, 665635) We can find other such reasons also if we think about the matter carefully.
('71', 325, 1, 16, 665711) For that, however, I will have to examine things on the spot.
('71', 325, 1, 17, 665773) I postpone that till I return there.
('71', 325, 1, 18, 665810) You have done well in closing the night school for the present.
('71', 325, 1, 19, 665874) If we attempt more than we can manage, we may do more harm than good.

('71', 325, 3, 21, 666038) 378. MY MISTAKE
('71', 325, 4, 22, 666054) In the issue of Harijanbandhu dated 16th May, I have said in an article entitled A Moral Dilemma 2, that amongst South Indian Brahmins the marriage of a maternal uncle to his niece is permissible, and so, too amongst Parsis and Muslims.
('71', 325, 4, 23, 666291) Professor Balvantrai Thakore 3 has, in an interesting letter, corrected this error of mine.
('71', 325, 4, 24, 666383) He points out that amongst the Brahmins of the South the children of a brother and sister are permitted to marry, but not a girl and her maternal uncle.
('71', 325, 4, 25, 666536) Poet Chaman informs us that such an alliance is prohibited amongst Muslims.
('71', 325, 4, 26, 666612) I am grateful to both these gentlemen for the correction.
('71', 325, 4, 27, 666670) I was actually aware of such an alliance between the

('71', 326, 1, 2, 666926) children of a brother and sister.
('71', 326, 1, 3, 666960) And I regard it as unpardonable on my part to have come to the conclusion and to have made a categorical statement that an alliance would be permissible between a girl and her maternal uncle.
('71', 326, 1, 4, 667152) I should have realized that in these matters presumptions such as mine have no place.
('71', 326, 1, 5, 667238) If I presumed, I should have indicated the uncertainly.
('71', 326, 1, 6, 667294) However, I categorically asserted something for which I had no actual evidence as if I had it.
('71', 326, 1, 7, 667389) And, as a result, my fidelity to truth has been blemished.
('71', 326, 1, 8, 667448) For this lapse I must beg forgiveness from readers.
('71', 326, 1, 9, 667500) They will be generous and forgive me, but my conscience will not forgive me so easily.
('71', 326, 1, 10, 667587) From this mistake I learnt the lesson that one has to exercise great care before coming to certain conclusions.
('71', 326, 1, 11, 667699) I shall henceforth try to be more careful to avoid such mistakes.

('71', 326, 5, 18, 667934) But at the moment I am inclined to say this.
('71', 326, 5, 19, 667979) Just as you dont need my opinion when deciding whether or no to give something to many others who may approach you for help, so also please assume that you dont need it in this case, too, and do what you think is proper.
('71', 326, 5, 20, 668200) If you must have my opinion, then you will have to wait for some time.
('71', 326, 5, 21, 668271) I hope that you are able to get some rest, do a lot of walking and observe the necessary restrictions on food.

('71', 327, 7, 23, 669848) The heart would remain pure because of it just as the body stays pure because of the circulation of blood.
('71', 327, 7, 24, 669955) This repetition of Ramanama should continue even while working or sleeping.
('71', 327, 7, 25, 670031) The test of it is that we do not get a single impure thought.

('71', 330, 4, 26, 674906) TITHAL, June 8, 1937
('71', 330, 5, 27, 674927) MY DEAR REBEL, The letter of 3rd came in today with that of 6th.
('71', 330, 5, 28, 674992) Mahadev is inquiring.
('71', 330, 5, 29, 675014) Mira has been well and yet she gets fever now and then.
('71', 330, 5, 30, 675070) She is ready to go to a hill station.
('71', 330, 5, 31, 675108) I forget what you had said about her coming to you.
('71', 330, 5, 32, 675160) My impression is that you had finally said No; she has an impression that you might have said Yes.
('71', 330, 5, 33, 675259) If you feel like taking her, you must see Shummy and let him decide.
('71', 330, 5, 34, 675328) She is an easy guest in a well ordered home.
('71', 330, 5, 35, 675373) But that is nothing.
('71', 330, 5, 36, 675394) You must decide without the slightest reserve.
('71', 330, 5, 37, 675441) Your No wont be misunderstood.
('71', 330, 5, 38, 675472) You will see what I have said 1 in Harijan.
('71', 330, 5, 39, 675516) If that is not enough you will tell me.

('71', 331, 1, 2, 675692) You may have political sense.
('71', 331, 1, 3, 675722) I have none.
('71', 331, 1, 4, 675735) But I claim the non violent sense to which you from the camphorated 1 area must be a stranger!
('71', 331, 1, 5, 675830) My solution is in furtherance of non violence.
('71', 331, 1, 6, 675877) That has been my policy and it has served me well.
('71', 331, 1, 7, 675928) I seem to possess the requisite acumen when I am assiduously accused of lacking it.
('71', 331, 1, 8, 676012) How else can they belittle my proposal?
('71', 331, 1, 9, 676052) 2 But am I not a free lance?
('71', 331, 1, 10, 676081) Congress can repudiate the suggestion, refuse office altogether or retrace its step and accept it unconditionally.
('71', 331, 1, 11, 676196) You should write to Vithaldas about the lace.
('71', 331, 1, 12, 676242) It is made in Andhra.
('71', 331, 1, 13, 676264) Send him specimens of what you would like.
('71', 331, 2, 14, 676307) BAPU [PS.] You may wire me about Mira at Wardha.

('71', 331, 6, 20, 676495) You are worrying needlessly.
('71', 331, 6, 21, 676524) It is your right to accept others service so long as you remain ill.
('71', 331, 6, 22, 676593) To take tea is not such a great crime that you should leave the Ashram on that account.
('71', 331, 6, 23, 676681) It is only for more important reasons that one should leave the Ashram.
('71', 331, 6, 24, 676753) It would be a different thing, of course, if you yourself dont like staying there.
('71', 331, 6, 25, 676836) As long as you are sincerely trying to observe the principal vows, there is no need at all for you to run away.

('71', 332, 3, 4, 677360) DEAR PROFESSOR, Sardar has handed me your letter of 31st ultimo for reply.
('71', 332, 3, 5, 677435) I entirely agree with you that the Congress has to think out a policy and give the lead on the reported kidnappings.
('71', 332, 3, 6, 677552) We must first of all be sure of the facts and therefore have an impartial inquiry.
('71', 332, 3, 7, 677635) The burden must be thrown on the Frontier Congressmen of tracing and bringing back by such influence as they may possess on tribesmen the kidnapped girls.
('71', 332, 3, 8, 677790) If the kidnappings are purely political, why do they kidnap only girls?
('71', 332, 3, 9, 677862) If they are instigated by the Government, we must have some proof for the statement.
('71', 332, 3, 10, 677947) Whilst we may have resolutions on the Government Frontier policy we must express our disapproval of the kidnappings and appeal to the tribesmen and enunciate our policy for the guidance of Congressmen generally and of Frontier Congressmen, in particular.

('71', 333, 9, 10, 679245) [Before June 10, 1937] 3
('71', 333, 10, 11, 679270) The pity is that most of our cow protection associations will keep cows and buffaloes both and try to run them and make them paying concerns by selling buffalos milk.
('71', 333, 10, 12, 679437) The cow, they think, is uneconomic, not knowing that if the cow was exclusively taken care of, and all attention concentrated on increasing her yield of milk, in making her a good breeder, and on making use of every bit of her carcass after she is dead, she would be more than an economic proposition.
('71', 333, 10, 13, 679739) If someone could convince me that both the cow and the buffalo could be protected, without our having to feed on them or slaughtering them, I should be only too willing to include both in my scheme.
('71', 333, 10, 14, 679938) The fact, however, is that the buffalo, apart from her milk, is an uneconomic animal.
('71', 333, 10, 15, 680024) Except in a few wet regions of India the buffalo is useless for agricultural purposes, and so we either starve or kill the male progeny.
('71', 333, 10, 16, 680161) Some of the best known dairies priding themselves on the wonderful milk yield of their cows have been found to be doing away with the male calves.
('71', 333, 10, 17, 680308) We have to make them good milkers and good mothers of fine plough bullocks.
('71', 333, 10, 18, 680384) It is no use saying that there is no demand for cows milk.
('71', 333, 10, 19, 680443) If we refused to supply any other milk, and if we ensured a supply of the richest and purest and safest milk, everyone would enlist himself as our regular customer.

('71', 334, 0, 1, 680825) VOL.71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 335
('71', 334, 1, 2, 680868) But the first thing is to eliminate the buffalo.
('71', 334, 1, 3, 680917) It is like the exclusive emphasis on khadi.
('71', 334, 1, 4, 680961) You cannot promote khadi by dividing your attention between khadi and mill cloth.
('71', 334, 1, 5, 681043) But we have not given the necessary attention to her feed and her upkeep.
('71', 334, 1, 6, 681117) Show the best results and I tell you you will not have to complain of lack of patronage.
('71', 334, 1, 7, 681206) Why is there such a mad run on a certain companys shares?
('71', 334, 1, 8, 681264) Because people know that it is going to be a highly paying concern.
('71', 334, 1, 9, 681332) If you could make people believe that yours also would be a payingconcern, they would rush to offer their patronage to you.
('71', 334, 1, 10, 681456) Concentrate on one.
('71', 334, 1, 11, 681476) Take a city like Bombay, take a census of the children, enlist the names of people who will buy only cows milk for their children, and make your dairy an exclusive cows milk supplier for children.
('71', 334, 1, 12, 681673) Dont you know how they popularize an article like tea?
('71', 334, 1, 13, 681728) They distribute free packets of tea, they run free tea houses.
('71', 334, 1, 14, 681791) You can do likewise and popularize cows milk.
('71', 334, 1, 15, 681837) Your ambition should be to cater to the needs of the whole of Bombay.
('71', 334, 1, 16, 681907) There is a demand for cows milk in a city like Calcutta.
('71', 334, 1, 17, 681964) The best Haryana breed are imported to Calcutta, but as soon as the cows go dry they go to the butcher.
('71', 334, 1, 18, 682068) The result is that the Haryana cow is getting scarce in the Punjab.
('71', 334, 1, 19, 682136) No, the cow need not go to the butcher at all.
('71', 334, 1, 20, 682183) She will have more than paid for her upkeep for her dry years by her rich yield of milk and progeny, and after death, she would fetch the same value as she did when alive.
('71', 334, 1, 21, 682355) The cow can either be protected by the State or by those who are really religiously inclined.
('71', 334, 1, 22, 682449) The State we may leave aside for the moment, it is the religiously inclined who should rise to the occasion and bring to bear knowledge and industry to the task.
('71', 334, 1, 23, 682611) Humanitarianism without knowledge is futile and may even be harmful.

('71', 334, 4, 28, 682915) Of course, you should not mind what Rafi says.
('71', 334, 4, 29, 682962) I do, however, feel that your position is different from mine.
('71', 334, 4, 30, 683025) I can speak and write as an intermediary from a detached point of view; you could not do so.

('71', 335, 1, 2, 683208) I had your letter drawing my attention to a portion of Ghanshyamdass letter 1. I had observed it before but it did not make any appeal to me.
('71', 335, 1, 3, 683350) Of course, there is force in his argument.
('71', 335, 1, 4, 683393) But from my standpoint it is irrelevant.
('71', 335, 1, 5, 683434) I want a sign from them before I take office, and I regard that sign as indispensable.
('71', 335, 1, 6, 683521) Therefore, for me acceptance continues to be a fatal blunder till our condition, whatever it may be, is satisfied.
('71', 335, 1, 7, 683636) The fact, therefore, that my condition may be demonstrably childish or meaningless does not affect my position.
('71', 335, 1, 8, 683748) What was this incident about asking for your ticket?

('71', 337, 6, 16, 686235) NOT A POLITICAL ORGANIZATION
('71', 337, 7, 17, 686264) As lovers of Hindi know the next session of the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan is to take place in Simla.
('71', 337, 7, 18, 686362) A correspondent who is working in Simla writes to say that there is a suspicion that the Sammelan is a political organization with anti Muslim tendencies.
('71', 337, 7, 19, 686517) Having been twice its President, I can unhesitatingly say that it is a purely non political organization.
('71', 337, 7, 20, 686623) It has Rajas and Maharajas as its patrons.
('71', 337, 7, 21, 686666) It has numerous non Congressmen who are identified with it.
('71', 337, 7, 22, 686726) Rajas and Maharajas often attend the sessions.
('71', 337, 7, 23, 686773) His Highness the Maharaja of Baroda has been one of its Presidents.
('71', 337, 7, 24, 686841) So far as I know it has no anti Muslim tendencies.
('71', 337, 7, 25, 686892) I could not have presided if I had suspected any.
('71', 337, 7, 26, 686942) I hope by anti Muslim is not meant anti Urdu.
('71', 337, 7, 27, 686988) Many use anti Urdu and anti Muslim as synonymous terms.
('71', 337, 7, 28, 687044) But that is a superstition.
('71', 337, 7, 29, 687072) Urdu is the common language of many Hindus and Mussalmans in the Punjab, Delhi and Kashmir.
('71', 337, 7, 30, 687164) It is also significant that at the session of the Sammelan held in Indore in 1935 it defined Hindi to mean that

('71', 338, 1, 3, 687555) I hope, therefore, that even if anti Muslim has been used in the sense of anti Urdu, the suspicion to which my correspondent refers will be dispelled and that the work of preparations for the session of the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan to be held in Simla will proceed without any suspicion about its object or attitude.
('71', 338, 2, 4, 687870) THE SOCIAL BAIT A friend who has had occasion to study the work of the Salvation Army sends me the following interesting note:
('71', 338, 3, 5, 687997) The Salvation Army is essentially a religious body with aggressive evangelism as its main characteristic.
('71', 338, 3, 6, 688103) The social work the Army does has from the first been regarded by the Army leaders as an organized warfare against social evils in order to clear the way for evangelization. This is from the Encyclopaedia Britannica (14th edition).
('71', 338, 3, 7, 688335) It further says that It was realized that the physical and the environmental condition of many of the people, especially in great cities, made it extremely difficult for them to apprehend the spiritual message which the Army had to deliver.
('71', 338, 3, 8, 688576) Therefore various social activities arose, diverse in character but all actuated by the same purpose, and General Booth himself in one of his letters to his son has said that the social works is the bait, but it is salvation that is the hook that lands the fish.
('71', 338, 4, 9, 688839) The object and the work of this Mission according to its Founder is to seek the conversion of the neglected crowds of people who are living without God and without hope, and to gather those so converted into Christian Fellowship. It is also stated in the Salvation Army Year Book for 1937 that upon Salvationists everywhere was urged the importance of personal evangelismthat each one was responsible before God for the salvation of others.
('71', 338, 4, 10, 689280) Personal touch, personal conversation, personal effort, it was pointed out, was of paramount importance nay, was the duty of every wearer of our uniform. Thus Every Soldier a Soul winner became and remains an inspiring slogan.
('71', 338, 4, 11, 689507) Of course what is true of the Army is more or less true of all Christian Missions.
('71', 338, 4, 12, 689590) Their social work is undertaken not for its own sake but as an aid to the salvation of those who receive social service.
('71', 338, 4, 13, 689711) The history of India would have been written differently if the Christians had come to India to live their lives in our midst and permeate ours with their aroma if there was any.
('71', 338, 4, 14, 689890) There would then have been mutual goodwill and utter absence of suspicion.
('71', 338, 4, 15, 689965) But say some of them, If what you say had held good with Jesus there wouldhave been no Christians. To answer this would land me in a controversy in which I have no desire to engage.
('71', 338, 4, 16, 690147) But I may be

('71', 339, 1, 3, 690274) He called men to repentance.
('71', 339, 1, 4, 690303) It was he who said, Not everyone that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. 1

('71', 339, 3, 6, 690489) 398. HARIJANS
('71', 339, 4, 7, 690503) But as for Harijans themselves, I certainly do not agree that they are stupid, or unintelligent, or lacking in religious sense.
('71', 339, 4, 8, 690631) They are not even unsophisticated.
('71', 339, 4, 9, 690666) If we tried to use the high pressure methods of which you accuse us, I assure you, we would get no results among them.
('71', 339, 4, 10, 690785) To me they are just nice people very much like myself and my brothers and sisters and friends.
('71', 339, 4, 11, 690880) To be sure, they are oppressed and illiterate, even unkempt, but they are thoughtful, spiritual minded, generous, kindly; in character they seem to me above, rather than below, the average of mankind.
('71', 339, 4, 12, 691081) I like them better than savarnasbut that is my bad taste, perhaps.
('71', 339, 5, 13, 691148) Still, I cannot figure out how you can live among them and hold such a superficial attitude towards them.
('71', 339, 5, 14, 691254) The only explanation that comes to my mind is that you either do not know them or you are insincere.
('71', 339, 5, 15, 691355) The latter is unworthy of attention.
('71', 339, 5, 16, 691392) But the former might be truefor we sometimes know least those who live in the same house with us.
('71', 339, 5, 17, 691490) Harijans do have strong self protective complex that is hard to get past.
('71', 339, 5, 18, 691564) A reserve past which they will not readily let an outsider come.
('71', 339, 5, 19, 691629) They may be in awe of your Mahatmaship (as we all are, a little) or it may be because they think you are a reincarnation of Rama (as they do think).
('71', 339, 5, 20, 691778) Maybe you begin by trying to uplift themit seems to be against human nature to appreciate being uplifted.
('71', 339, 5, 21, 691884) Maybe you still unconsciously have a little high caste attitudesavarna Christians have that
('71', 339, 6, 22, 691976) trouble sometimes.
('71', 339, 6, 23, 691995) It may be your city outlook.
('71', 339, 6, 24, 692024) Whatever it is, you are not seeing them as I see them.
('71', 339, 7, 25, 692079) I admit I have certain advantages.
('71', 339, 7, 26, 692114) I myself am a villager, so can enter into their life of farming, gardening, raising chickens, pigs, goats, cows.
('71', 339, 7, 27, 692227) As a nurse I could help them in sickness and teach them how to have better health.
('71', 339, 7, 28, 692310) I was an untouchable to savarna Hindus, as they were, and was glad to be
('71', 339, 8, 29, 692383) allowed to get water out of a decent cattle trough rather than the tanks the pigs and buffaloes wallowed in, when I toured in the villages.
('71', 339, 8, 30, 692523) So I wasnt an outsider to their lifenot even a visitor.
('71', 339, 8, 31, 692579) I was, as they said, a relative, one of themselves.
('71', 339, 8, 32, 692631) It naturally followed that we would love and respect each other
('71', 339, 9, 33, 692695) 1 St. Matthew, VII.
('71', 340, 0, 1, 692715) VOL.71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 341
('71', 340, 1, 2, 692758) and that we would trust each other spiritually.
('71', 340, 1, 3, 692806) Our spiritual communion was always on terms of equality.
('71', 340, 1, 4, 692863) I received as much from them as I gavemaybe more.
('71', 340, 1, 5, 692913) At least I can testify that some of the deepest spiritual thinking, the most exquisite spiritual attainment, that I have ever known, I have seen in the souls of Depressed Class Hindusand I dont mean exceptional, educated ones, I mean illiterate villagers.
('71', 340, 1, 6, 693169) But would I have seen it if I had been haggling them to become Christians?
('71', 340, 1, 7, 693244) I assure you I would not!
('71', 340, 2, 8, 693270) Occasionally for information I asked one who was thorougly familiar with Christian doctrine, what he thought of it, pro and con, and he answered me as readily and frankly as if I had asked whether to feed an ox oil cake or jowari and why.
('71', 340, 3, 9, 693509) To be sure they talk politics and economics, but it is only the spiritual interest that holds them till midnight, brings them back at dawn, and in the hot noonday with the plea, If you knew how we want to hear that God loves us, you wouldnt want to rest.
('71', 340, 4, 10, 693764) If you cannot meet that need, you cannot hold the Depressed Classesif you can meet it you will hold them.
('71', 340, 4, 11, 693870) For that is what they are askingyes, and Shudras, too, and even some merchants and Brahmins.
('71', 340, 4, 12, 693963) This is an extract from a long letter 1 received from an American sister who has lived for years in India as a Missionary.
('71', 340, 4, 13, 694086) I heartily endorse the last statement in the extract.
('71', 340, 4, 14, 694140) Of course, if I cannot meet their spiritual needs, I cannot hold the Harijans.
('71', 340, 4, 15, 694219) But I am not so stupid as to think that I or any single person can supply the spiritual needs of his neighbour.
('71', 340, 4, 16, 694331) Spiritual needs cannot be supplied through the intellect or through the stomach even as the needs of the body cannot be supplied through the spirit.
('71', 340, 4, 17, 694480) One can paraphrase the famous saying of Jesus and say Render unto the body that which is its, and unto the spirit that which is its. And the only way I can supply my neighbours spiritual needs is by living the life of the spirit without even exchanging a word with him.
('71', 340, 4, 18, 694750) The life of the spirit will translate itself into acts of love for my neighbour.
('71', 340, 4, 19, 694831) Therefore I have not a shadow of doubt that Hinduism will (and rightly) lose Harijans if the so called caste Hindus will not love Harijansthe outcaste Hinduseven as themselves.
('71', 340, 4, 20, 695008) If they will just do that and nothing else, Hinduism is safe and so are Harijans and they.
('71', 340, 4, 21, 695099) If they will not, they and Hinduism will surely perish.
('71', 340, 4, 22, 695155) The so called high caste Hindus may spend millions for Harijans, but if they do not do the one thing needful, i.e., regard the Harijans as their spiritual equals, the material

('71', 341, 1, 2, 695438) aid will stink in their nostrils and will be and deserve to be thrown away as so much waste.
('71', 341, 1, 3, 695531) But to admit that Harijans have the same spiritual need as the rest of us, is not to say that they would understand the intellectual presentation of Christianity as much as I would, for instance.
('71', 341, 1, 4, 695727) I put them on the same level as my own wife.
('71', 341, 1, 5, 695772) Her spiritual needs are no less than mine, but she would no more understand the presentation of Christianity than any ordinary Harijan would.
('71', 341, 1, 6, 695914) The reason is obvious.
('71', 341, 1, 7, 695937) We came together practically as children.
('71', 341, 1, 8, 695979) My studies went on in spite of marriage.
('71', 341, 1, 9, 696020) She never attended a school before marriage.
('71', 341, 1, 10, 696065) I neglected her educational training.
('71', 341, 1, 11, 696103) Presentation, with a view to conversion, of a faith other than ones own, can only necessarily be through an appeal to the intellect or the stomach or both.
('71', 341, 1, 12, 696259) I do maintain in spite of the extract I have quoted that the vast mass of Harijans, and for that matter Indian humanity, cannot understand the presentation of Christianity, and that generally speaking their conversion wherever it has taken place has not been a spiritual act in any sense of the term.
('71', 341, 1, 13, 696560) They are conversions for convenience.
('71', 341, 1, 14, 696598) And I have had overwhelming corroboration of the truth during my frequent and extensive wanderings.
('71', 341, 1, 15, 696698) The writer has no warrant for suggesting that I do not know or love Harijans sufficiently because I attribute to Harijans inability to receive Christian teachings.
('71', 341, 1, 16, 696862) My attitude is not superficial as she will have it to be.
('71', 341, 1, 17, 696920) Whatever it is, it is based on deep experience and observation dependent not on days or even a years contact, but on close contact for years with tens of thousands of Indias masses, not as a superior being but feeling as one of them.
('71', 341, 1, 18, 697154) But she is wholly right when she says, whatever it is, you are not seeing them as I see them. They are my kith and kin, breathing the same air, living the same life, having the same faith, the same aspirations, and the same earth sustaining us in life as it will in death!

('71', 342, 11, 18, 698695) He says if you feel it unavoidable you can certainly write any particular part of your letter in English, but since you have started writing in Hindi you should continue it.
('71', 342, 11, 19, 698869) You should increase the practice of Hindi.
('71', 342, 11, 20, 698912) Even if you find it difficult to express any thoughts, you should not care much.
('71', 342, 11, 21, 698993) And as a last resort there is always the freedom to write in English.
('71', 342, 12, 22, 699063) Now [Bapuji] will write only if there is anything to write about after getting more news about Vidya.

('71', 343, 2, 3, 699481) June 12, 1937 You must know that this work is for your own benefit, and not for the benefit of the malguzar.
('71', 343, 2, 4, 699590) He had never even thought of this.
('71', 343, 2, 5, 699625) But you will not keep your promise and I have come to express my pain to you.
('71', 343, 2, 6, 699703) You must remember that this is a recurring task.
('71', 343, 2, 7, 699752) Every year the road will have to be renewed and stone will have to be supplied by you.
('71', 343, 2, 8, 699839) If you do not co operate with me, all the labour that we have put in this year will be wasted.
('71', 343, 2, 9, 699934) This year the profits from the village have not been equal to the tasks we have undertaken, and it was never my purpose to draw upon Jamnalaljis other income for the purposes of this village.
('71', 343, 2, 10, 700126) I shall therefore have to find the expense from the donations I receive for Segaon work.
('71', 343, 2, 11, 700215) You will therefore understand the gravity of the breach of promise.
('71', 343, 2, 12, 700283) I therefore appeal to those of you who have not kept their promises to cart the stones to the other road.
('71', 343, 2, 13, 700389) I shall ask Jamnalalji to pay for the stones and use the proceeds for the welfare of Segaon.
('71', 343, 2, 14, 700482) But I am told that you are indifferent to all that is happening, that you do not care whether you have the road here or not.
('71', 343, 2, 15, 700607) I ask you to put your heads together and decide whether you should co operate with us or not.
('71', 343, 2, 16, 700701) I do not refer to untouchability.
('71', 343, 2, 17, 700735) There is no untouchability involved in this work, nor in the revival of your handicrafts.
('71', 343, 2, 18, 700825) If you co operate, I can assure you that your income will easily be doubled.
('71', 343, 2, 19, 700902) Then there is the question of sanitation.
('71', 343, 2, 20, 700944) I cannot make your village neat and clean and sweet smelling without your co operation.
('71', 343, 2, 21, 701032) We have engaged a scavenger here.
('71', 343, 2, 22, 701066) We pay for his service, but it is for you to keep your streets and lanes clean.
('71', 343, 2, 23, 701146) We have
('71', 343, 3, 24, 701154) 1 This is extracted from Weekly Letter by Mahadev Desai, who had reported: When I was there last Saturday I found him addressing a little meeting of the villagers.
('71', 343, 3, 25, 701318) There were very few women, but there was a good attendance of men.
('71', 343, 3, 26, 701385) The occaion was the making of a road through the village to Gandhijis quarters, and meeting a road that ran to Wardha.
('71', 343, 3, 27, 701504) The Wardha road is being built at Jamnalaljis cost.
('71', 343, 3, 28, 701556) The village road was proposed by the villagers themselves.
('71', 343, 3, 29, 701615) They had given a written undertaking signed by no less than 70 people, each of whom had agreed to bring cartloads of stone for three days, the other expenses to be met by Gandhiji, at whose disposal Jamnalalji had placed all the profits accruing to him from the village, for the public good of the village.
('71', 343, 3, 30, 701922) But when the work was actually begun the workers were hard put to it in persuading the signatories to keep their pledge.
('71', 343, 3, 31, 702043) From 15 to 20 people had kept their promise.
('71', 343, 3, 32, 702088) The rest had not.
('71', 343, 3, 33, 702106) But Gandhiji could not break his pledge.
('71', 343, 3, 34, 702147) He saw the thing through.
('71', 343, 3, 35, 702173) He explained the whole situation to the villagers.

('71', 344, 10, 16, 703004) MY DEAR REBEL, Your letter.
('71', 344, 10, 17, 703032) I have no doubt that the Harijan article 3 will be copied elsewhere.
('71', 344, 10, 18, 703101) It ought to give satisfaction.
('71', 344, 10, 19, 703132) But as I have said, [if] anything more is required, you will let me know.
('71', 344, 10, 20, 703206) The Muslim distrust
('71', 344, 11, 21, 703226) 1 Mahadev Desai had concluded the report: The old Patel, the leader of the village, said that what Gandhiji had said was all right, and he was grateful and happy that Gandhiji was in their midst.
('71', 344, 11, 22, 703422) But two things they could not do.
('71', 344, 11, 23, 703456) Untouchability they could not possibly give up and they could not cart human manure.
('71', 344, 11, 24, 703541) In all other matters he would promise their co operation. 2 Mirabehn explains: "I had gone to Dalhousie where Bapu had sent me on account of bad health.
('71', 344, 11, 25, 703694) I stayed at the house of Dr. and Mrs. Dharmavir where Subhas Babu was also staying at that time." 3 Vide Notes sub title Not A Political Organization, 12 6 1937

('71', 345, 1, 3, 703947) But if anyone can do it you are the person.
('71', 345, 1, 4, 703991) You must therefore study the whole question so thoroughly as to be able to answer every objection.
('71', 345, 1, 5, 704090) Whatever you cannot answer, you will pass on to me and I shall deal with it.
('71', 345, 1, 6, 704167) I am afraid this writing is too faint to decipher.
('71', 345, 1, 7, 704218) If it is, you will let me know.
('71', 345, 1, 8, 704250) I would like you even to return the letter so that I can have the lesson imprinted on my memory.
('71', 345, 1, 9, 704347) The ink was too thick.
('71', 345, 1, 10, 704370) I addedwater.
('71', 345, 1, 11, 704384) It has served my purpose but I doubt if the writing won't fade by the time this reaches you.

('71', 345, 6, 19, 704708) DEAR RAGHAVAN, You are keeping me regularly posted with the doings of the Sabha.
('71', 345, 6, 20, 704789) I have carefully read your letter to the members about the difficulty you are finding in coping with the responsibility that Rajagopalachari has thrust on you.
('71', 345, 6, 21, 704949) Having put your hands to the plough, I would like you to hold on to it till you find a firmer hand yourself.
('71', 345, 6, 22, 705058) Rajagopalachari when he mentioned your name was most enthusiastic about you and all I have since heard confirms what he told me.
('71', 345, 6, 23, 705187) Is it not your experience that those who are most wanted for a particular cause have already several causes which they have to serve?
('71', 345, 6, 24, 705321) Such is the paucity of true workers all the world over.
('71', 345, 6, 25, 705377) But it is much more felt in our country.
('71', 345, 6, 26, 705418) I, therefore, hope that you will not think of giving up what you have taken up without finding an efficient substitute.

('71', 346, 8, 10, 706095) MY DEAR REBEL, Having just got your letter, this is just to tell you I understand and appreciate your 'No' 1. I had expected it.
('71', 346, 8, 11, 706224) Mira went yesterday to Dalhousie, having got Subhas's wire.
('71', 346, 8, 12, 706284) Why should you worry about explaining the 'No' to me?
('71', 346, 8, 13, 706338) Must every 'yes' and every 'no' need explaining?
('71', 346, 8, 14, 706387) Love that demands such explanations must be sorry stuff.
('71', 346, 8, 15, 706444) Mine never is.
('71', 346, 8, 16, 706459) It can stand many "nos so long as there is a yes' interspersed.

('71', 347, 3, 4, 706784) MY DEAR REBEL, Herewith Andrews's letter.
('71', 347, 3, 5, 706826) Can't cheer those who won't be cheered.
('71', 347, 3, 6, 706866) I am positive that you have no cause to feel depressed.
('71', 347, 3, 7, 706922) You will feel depressed even when you do the right thing, if so doing you are likely to wound somebody's susceptibility.
('71', 347, 3, 8, 707043) How are you to cheer such stupid people?
('71', 347, 3, 9, 707084) Are they to be told to do the wrong thing in order to escape depression?
('71', 347, 3, 10, 707157) Read Chapter 6 of the Gita or Japji.
('71', 347, 3, 11, 707194) You will find in the latter many passages to dispel your depression which is a form of ignorance.
('71', 347, 3, 12, 707292) I suppose Jawaharlal wrote to me at the same time that he wrote to you.
('71', 347, 3, 13, 707364) For in his letter to me also he alludes to his sore throat, etc.
('71', 347, 3, 14, 707429) He is likely to be with me during the last week of the month.

('71', 348, 9, 14, 708543) I have also noted down the date.

('71', 351, 2, 8, 711840) She couldn't get rid of her fever.
('71', 351, 2, 9, 711875) Your asking for exemption from fees does not seem proper.
('71', 351, 2, 10, 711933) It was not proper either, that the lawyer should have been fined.
('71', 351, 2, 11, 711999) If you can carry on without staying in a hostel, it would be worth while to save that expense.
('71', 351, 2, 12, 712094) I had understood from what you said that you would stay with Ramji and thus save boarding and lodging expenses.
('71', 351, 2, 13, 712206) If, however, you think that staying in a hostel will be of great benefit to you, never mind the expense.
('71', 351, 2, 14, 712311) You did well in giving Devdas all the details.
('71', 351, 2, 15, 712358) You cannot by any means be but in the category of the poor.
('71', 351, 2, 16, 712418) Only those who have none to support them can be called poor.
('71', 351, 2, 17, 712479) How much was the lawyer fined?
('71', 351, 2, 18, 712510) Take care of your health.
('71', 351, 2, 19, 712536) Even when you don't get time to write, you should drop a postcard at least once in a week.
('71', 351, 2, 20, 712627) But if you can write a letter as long as 50 postcards every week, then that is what you should do.

('71', 352, 2, 3, 713500) June 15, 1937
('71', 352, 3, 4, 713514) BHAI NATHUBHAI, The period of vanapravesh will last up to 58. 1 In these many years you can do a lot.
('71', 352, 3, 5, 713616) When a man enters the forest he is bound to make friends with trees, leaves, birds and animals.
('71', 352, 3, 6, 713712) He would attain fearlessness, be acquainted with Nature, would live in the midst of men and animals and know what man's place in the world is and, by the time he emerges from the forest, would have gathered such knowledge which would be helpful to himself and which would enable him to guide his neighbours.
('71', 352, 3, 7, 714020) We have to create such a forest in our heart.
('71', 352, 3, 8, 714066) If physical desires lose their keenness and we become inward looking, we shall have gained much.
('71', 352, 3, 9, 714163) You have done a bit of research to discover my mistake.
('71', 352, 3, 10, 714219) I have also had letters from four or five other Gujarati friends from the South in that regard.
('71', 352, 3, 11, 714315) Indu stayed for quite some time with me and we talked at length on many things.
('71', 352, 3, 12, 714395) He is still a child.
('71', 352, 3, 13, 714416) He is not yet aware of his responsibilities.
('71', 352, 3, 14, 714461) But he does have some good qualities.
('71', 352, 3, 15, 714499) He has great regard for Kanti.
('71', 352, 3, 16, 714530) He wishes to share in lightening the burden that has fallen on you.
('71', 352, 3, 17, 714598) Hence I hope that he will do something.
('71', 352, 3, 18, 714638) Now he will be staying under the direct care of Kanti.
('71', 352, 3, 19, 714693) Everything, therefore, will be well.

('71', 352, 9, 24, 714845) BHAI JETHALAL, I have your letter.
('71', 352, 9, 25, 714880) Now observe the 30th July but instead of the 30th you can observe the 31st because July has thirty one days.
('71', 352, 9, 26, 714989) Do send the book of Vinoba.
('71', 352, 9, 27, 715017) I suppose the Mobile Weaving School of Travancore must be mentioned only in the pages of his book; I somehow could find no trace of it there.

('71', 353, 0, 1, 715235) 354 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 353, 1, 2, 715277) my going to Gujarat.
('71', 353, 1, 3, 715298) Of course, I was expected to go there for two or three days to inspect the site for the Congress.
('71', 353, 1, 4, 715396) But then I also have no reason for not going either.
('71', 353, 1, 5, 715449) I may say that Sardar's keen insistence dragged me.
('71', 353, 1, 6, 715501) But this is not real defence.
('71', 353, 1, 7, 715531) If sardar's insistence can persuade me to do something wrong, his other importunities may persuade me to commit greater wrongs.
('71', 353, 1, 8, 715659) In spite of knowing all this I could not withstand his insistence.
('71', 353, 1, 9, 715726) Now about cow's ghee.
('71', 353, 1, 10, 715748) I charge Rs. 3 per seer or even two and a half.
('71', 353, 1, 11, 715796) I charge according to the cost.
('71', 353, 1, 12, 715828) I am able to get this much because there are people like Jamnalalji and I am able to insist on their using cow's ghee prepared in Wardha.
('71', 353, 1, 13, 715966) But I shall not be able to carry on this Rs. 3 per seer business for long.
('71', 353, 1, 14, 716041) Your ghee of course cannot be sold even free of cost because we cannot accept an agency for buffalo's ghee.
('71', 353, 1, 15, 716149) Moreover your ghee is adulterated.
('71', 353, 1, 16, 716184) It is my firm belief that this business of yours is wrong.
('71', 353, 1, 17, 716243) As you do not abide by the regulations of the Goseva Sangh, you do not get any help from them and therefore make adulterated ghee at home.
('71', 353, 1, 18, 716382) Naturally it fetches lower price in the market.
('71', 353, 1, 19, 716430) Nowadays ghee made out of pure buffalo's milk fetches a good price in the market.
('71', 353, 1, 20, 716512) Ghee made from from pure cow's milk fetches a lower price.
('71', 353, 1, 21, 716571) So if at the moment you make no distinction between the cow and the buffalo, you should engage yourself in making ghee only out of buffalo's milk.
('71', 353, 1, 22, 716718) You will surely succeed in it.
('71', 353, 1, 23, 716749) I can understand that it will not give you mental satisfaction.
('71', 353, 1, 24, 716813) But if you derive any mental satisfaction from mixing cow's milk with buffalo's, it is a false satisfaction.
('71', 353, 1, 25, 716922) Hence it is my sincere advice that you should either make ghee out of pure cow's milk and sell it at the normal rate or, failing that, find some other occupation which would be beneficial to the villages.
('71', 353, 1, 26, 717127) Obtain from the public whatever cannot be met by the income from the business.
('71', 353, 1, 27, 717206) But this after all is my opinion.
('71', 353, 1, 28, 717240) There is no absolute rule that you have to follow my advice in such matters.
('71', 353, 1, 29, 717317) Of course I would never insist.
('71', 353, 1, 30, 717349) So think over my argument and do only what you think proper.
('71', 353, 1, 31, 717410) Kishorelalbhai will of course read this, and, if possible, Vinoba, too.
('71', 353, 1, 32, 717482) I shall try to send their opinions along with this.

('71', 354, 3, 5, 717733) Third class travelling is safe only with me.
('71', 354, 3, 6, 717778) However, it is well that you reached Dalhousie 1 safely.

('71', 354, 3, 8, 717917) I hope you have all my letters.
('71', 354, 3, 9, 717949) Only yesterday I could not send you anything.
('71', 354, 3, 10, 717995) Dr. Dharmavir's wire of safe arrival was duly received.
('71', 354, 3, 11, 718051) I am sure you will be restored there.
('71', 354, 3, 12, 718089) No rain here yet.

('71', 354, 8, 22, 718398) DEAR FRIEND, I welcome your letter.
('71', 354, 8, 23, 718434) I must admit that the decision, after meeting in Delhi and thereafter, I had forgotten.
('71', 354, 8, 24, 718522) But the recollection does not affect what I said 2 at Hudli.
('71', 354, 8, 25, 718583) My charge was against those who had come to induce me to preside at the meeting in Belgaum.
('71', 354, 8, 26, 718675) I was most disinclined knowing well that my programme would not be popular nor my method of work.
('71', 354, 8, 27, 718773) But Gangadharrao whom I knew very well bore down my opposition and assured me that Mr. Chikodi and others would whole heartedly work out the scheme.
('71', 354, 8, 28, 718922) Gangadharrao himself admits that he failed.
('71', 354, 8, 29, 718966) He could not even personally confine himself to cow's milk, nor Mr. Chikodi who was to be active worker in the movement.
('71', 354, 8, 30, 719087) As I said the collapse of the

('71', 355, 1, 2, 719267) resolution of the big body was tragic, through no fault of anybody.
('71', 355, 1, 3, 719335) But my fault was in not sufficiently realizing that my method of working out the cow protection programme would not be popular and that I would have to show results by experimenting.
('71', 355, 1, 4, 719518) That experiment is still going on.
('71', 355, 1, 5, 719553) Tanning at Ahmedabad did not succeed, because the so called experts were not really experts.
('71', 355, 1, 6, 719646) But as it always existed in my imagination it has taken shape in Wardha and Bengal.
('71', 355, 1, 7, 719730) In Wardha the experiment is being conducted under my direct supervision and in Bengal under the supervision of one of my colleagues.
('71', 355, 1, 8, 719863) I can still show no striking results because the experiment is novel and difficult.
('71', 355, 1, 9, 719947) This programme is not any part of the village movement, although it can be.
('71', 355, 1, 10, 720023) It is being worked out independently as part of the scheme not of village improvement but of cow protection.
('71', 355, 1, 11, 720132) My point remains that those who invited me in Belgaum to take up the cow protection work were previously in that field and should not have given it up because I failed or seemed to fail.

('71', 357, 12, 17, 722643) KRISHNACHANDRA, It is surprising that you do not notice the unity of thought between my current writings and what I wrote in Anasaktiyoga 3 .
('71', 357, 12, 18, 722785) We creatures are not all dharmaja progeny, but kamaja.
('71', 357, 12, 19, 722840) Let us suppose that a man in full control of his passion desires progeny and a suitable mate, too, who desires progeny only from him and is not moved by passion.
('71', 357, 12, 20, 723002) Their son would be dharmaja.
('71', 357, 12, 21, 723031) But this does not imply that none among their ancestors were kamaja.
('71', 357, 12, 22, 723100) 4 Thus what I mean is that
('71', 357, 13, 23, 723127) 1 In "Letter to Mirabehn", 19 6 1937, however ,Gandhiji says that they came on the 19th.

('71', 358, 1, 2, 723568) though we are full of imperfections we should make an effort at any rate to rid ourselves of them.
('71', 358, 1, 3, 723667) I cannot say from personal experience whether it is possible or not to procreate dharmaja offspring but I do hold that the remark in the Adiparva of Mahabharta regarding Vyasji stems from experience.
('71', 358, 1, 4, 723867) 1 It is possible that it is only a poetic fancy and not an actual experience.
('71', 358, 1, 5, 723945) But this takes away nothing from my argument because if a couple come together not moved by passion but only for the sake of progeny, their brahmacharya is in no was lessened.
('71', 358, 1, 6, 724121) But there can be only one single offspring of this kind.
('71', 358, 1, 7, 724178) This is a description of the ideal state.
('71', 358, 1, 8, 724220) And we must try to reach it to the extent we can.
('71', 358, 1, 9, 724270) Procreation is no obligatory duty, but the desire for it is no sin either.
('71', 358, 1, 10, 724345) Thus marriage is impermissible for one who has no wish for progeny, i.e., satisfaction of passion should never be the ground for marriage.
('71', 358, 1, 11, 724484) Married people should follow their duty keeping this ideal in view.
('71', 358, 1, 12, 724552) Write to me when all your efforts for securing a job have failed.
('71', 358, 1, 13, 724618) Please bear in mind that I have no idea what resources I may have then.
('71', 358, 1, 14, 724690) And in case you have to come here you should settle down contentedly because you should not limit your services on the basis of the amount of salary you may get.

('71', 358, 6, 18, 724930) Thakkar Bapa had his attention drawn to the so called conversion to Christianity in Shahabad District.
('71', 358, 6, 19, 725033) He thereupon called for a report on the statements made to him.
('71', 358, 6, 20, 725097) The following is the report 2 made by the local Harijan Sevak Sangh:
('71', 358, 7, 21, 725166) In the district of Shahbad, about 40 years ago, a Methodist Episcopal Christian Mission was established at Arrah.
('71', 358, 7, 22, 725280) Through its efforts a large number of Harijans, numbering about three thousand, were converted to Christianity up to the year 1931. .
('71', 358, 7, 23, 725414) Last year a Roman Catholic Mission appeared on the scene.
('71', 358, 7, 24, 725472) Since then, the activities of both the Missions have increased .
('71', 358, 7, 25, 725537) .Enquiry has revealed that they have been successful in getting
('71', 358, 8, 26, 725601) 1 Vide Advice to Newly Married Couples, 18 4 1937 2 Only excerpts are reproduced here.
('71', 359, 0, 1, 725688) 360 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 359, 1, 2, 725730) some new Christian converts from the Rabidas (Chamar) community amongst whom their activities are mainly confined.
('71', 359, 1, 3, 725845) Roughly their method of work may be described as follows: After having visited the village and created familiarity with the Harijans they at once start a school and put it in charge of a Harijan teacher who either himself is an influential man or related to such a one.
('71', 359, 1, 4, 726115) Whenever they come to learn that some tension or actual litigation is going on between the Harijans and other villagers they at once seize the opportunity to take up the side of the poor Harijans and help them with money and advice.
('71', 359, 1, 5, 726348) They are thus hailed as saviours and conversion follows as if to repay the obligation.
('71', 359, 2, 6, 726435) As their work is scattered throughhout the thana in the remotest
('71', 359, 3, 7, 726500) villages, the present enquiry could not be exhaustive .
('71', 359, 3, 8, 726556) The one remarkable feature of these recent conversions is that they take place en masse.
('71', 359, 3, 9, 726645) Whenever a village Harijan leader accepts the new faith almost all
('71', 359, 4, 10, 726712) belonging to his clan follow him .
('71', 359, 4, 11, 726747) In all cases of conversions new or old, not a single instance can be found in which the acceptance of the new faith was due to any religious conviction .
('71', 359, 4, 12, 726901) The reasons, therefore, of conversions may be roughly described as economic or socioeconomic.
('71', 359, 4, 13, 726995) Generally, the Harijans have to submit to a number of unjust exactions and to suffer from humiliating treatment which are now resented by them .
('71', 359, 4, 14, 727140) Those of the new and the old who are still continuing as nominal Christians are willing to return to Hinduism if their grievances are removed.
('71', 359, 4, 15, 727283) Their grievances as disclosed during the enquiry are briefly indicated below: 1. They are forced to labour for their maliks and other caste Hindus of their villages at about half or even less wages then they would get for the same kind of labour in other villages.
('71', 359, 4, 16, 727548) 2. They are forced to labour for their maliks and other caste Hindu villgers on occasions of marriages and deaths in their families on almost no wages.
('71', 359, 5, 17, 727700) 3. They are charged six annas per year per family as mutharfa (house
('71', 359, 7, 18, 727769) 4. They have to pay Re.
('71', 359, 7, 19, 727793) 1, Rs. 2 and Rs. 3 or Rs. 4 for the hide of every dead cow, bullock or buffalo respectively to their owners if they fail to deliver a corresponding number of pairs of shoes to them.
('71', 359, 8, 20, 727975) 5. Their wives are paid only four annas for a male or two annas for a female child born in the house of the caste Hindu villagers where they have to work as midwives during confinement, and even these payments are not regularly made.
('71', 359, 9, 21, 728209) 6. They are forced to work for their maliks and caste Hindu villgers even
('71', 359, 10, 22, 728283) at the sacrifice of their own agricultural needs or when they are ill or engaged in their social or religious functions.
('71', 360, 0, 1, 728404) VOL.71 : 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 361
('71', 360, 1, 2, 728448) 7. The levy of the Chowkidari tax on them is generally excessive.
('71', 360, 2, 3, 728514) 8. They are not allowed to draw water from wells used by caste Hindus.
('71', 360, 3, 4, 728585) 9. They are not allowed to enter temples nor are Brahmin priests available to recite religious kathas at their houses.
('71', 360, 3, 5, 728704) If what is said in the report about the conversions be true, it is from my standpoint reprehensible.
('71', 360, 3, 6, 728805) Such superficial conversions can only give rise to suspicion and strife.
('71', 360, 3, 7, 728878) But if a missionary body or individuals choose to follow the methods described in the report, nothing can be done to prevent them.
('71', 360, 3, 8, 729009) It is therefore much more profitable to turn the searchlight inward and to discover our own defects.
('71', 360, 3, 9, 729110) Fortunately the report enables us to do so.
('71', 360, 3, 10, 729154) Nine causes are enumerated to show why Harijans are induced to leave the Hindu fold.
('71', 360, 3, 11, 729239) Seven are purely economic, one is social, and one is purely religious.
('71', 360, 3, 12, 729310) Thus they are reduced economically, degraded socially and boycotted from religious participation.
('71', 360, 3, 13, 729408) The wonder is not that they leave Hinduism; the wonder is that they have not done so for so long and that so few leave their ancestral faith even when they do.
('71', 360, 3, 14, 729568) The moral is obvious.
('71', 360, 3, 15, 729590) Let us make every discovery, such as the one made in Shahabad, an occasion for greater self purification, greater dedication to the harijan cause, greater identification with the Harijans.
('71', 360, 3, 16, 729779) It should result in the local Sangh collecting more workers than it has for doing on the one hand service among the Harijans and on the other propaganda among the so called caste Hindus, not in the shape of reviling them but showing them that religion does not warrant the treatment that is meted out to Harijans by them.

('71', 360, 4, 18, 730120) 429. KHADI AT HARIPURA
('71', 360, 5, 19, 730143) Dastane is anxious that something striking should happen at Haripura so as to make khadi much more popular than it is.
('71', 360, 5, 20, 730262) There are other workers who no doubt anticipate great things from Haripura about khadi.
('71', 360, 5, 21, 730350) Bardoli's promise to be wholly self sustained about khadi made in 1921 still remains unredeemed.
('71', 360, 5, 22, 730447) Painful to tell, Bardoli like other places falls back on Wardha for its cheap and well coloured khadi.
('71', 360, 5, 23, 730550) The khadi method excludes concentration.
('71', 360, 5, 24, 730591) Wardha is in no need of outside patronage.
('71', 360, 5, 25, 730634) And if it began to rely on it, it would harm itself and khadi in the long run.
('71', 360, 5, 26, 730713) The secret of success in khadi is for each taluk or at least district to produce and use its own khadi.
('71', 361, 0, 1, 730817) 362 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 361, 1, 2, 730859) But Sjt.
('71', 361, 1, 3, 730868) Dastane says, though the Working Committee has re emphasized the fourfold programme of 1920, there is hardly an M.L.A. who talks about it to his constituency.
('71', 361, 1, 4, 731027) And if the khadi lovers, too, do not show application or orginality, khadi has a poor chance of becoming universal.
('71', 361, 1, 5, 731143) There is force in what Sjt.
('71', 361, 1, 6, 731171) Dastane says.
('71', 361, 1, 7, 731185) But things are not quite as bad as he perhaps imagines.
('71', 361, 1, 8, 731241) In Nalwadi, Vinoba is practically concentntrating the whole of his attention on khadi.
('71', 361, 1, 9, 731328) He is making experiments to see whether the minimum of three annas per day of eight hours for spinners is an easily realizable proposition.
('71', 361, 1, 10, 731468) It bids fair to succeed.
('71', 361, 1, 11, 731493) There is a boy 16 year old who is a villager of quite the ordinary type.
('71', 361, 1, 12, 731566) He is earning four annas per day.
('71', 361, 1, 13, 731600) If the average villager has a sufficient ocular demonstration of the possibility of earning three annas per day, and if he or she knows that there is an organization that will take in all the standard yarn that can be produced, there will be a spontaneous response.
('71', 361, 1, 14, 731866) Now this kind of very solid work does not admit of haste or a spectacular display.
('71', 361, 1, 15, 731949) Then there is one great difficulty in the way.
('71', 361, 1, 16, 731996) The spinners, weavers and other artisans engaged in khadi production are expected to use khadi for their own wear.
('71', 361, 1, 17, 732111) This means popular education in the economics of khadi, a change in the mentality of the poor artisans who do not know anything of why they are so helpless and poor and still less of how they can help themselves to get rid of their ignorance and poverty.
('71', 361, 1, 18, 732366) The spread of such education means again a large number of workers possessing love of khadi and an adequate knowledge of the economics and the technique of khadi.
('71', 361, 1, 19, 732529) Thus there are very natural difficulties to be overcome in the attempt to make khadi universal.
('71', 361, 1, 20, 732625) Let Sjt.
('71', 361, 1, 21, 732634) Dastane and others who feel like him about khadi make a deep study of the science and make their own experiments if they have any original contribution to make or pursue the beaten track and give to the work their exclusive attention.

('71', 361, 3, 24, 732909) Not many people know what is phooka.
('71', 361, 3, 25, 732946) Still fewer know that there is an association in Calcutta called the Anti phooka Association.
('71', 361, 3, 26, 733040) Its patrons are Maharajadhiraja Sir Bijoy Chand Mahatab Bahadur and Justice Sir L. W. J. Costello.
('71', 361, 3, 27, 733139) Its president is Shri Ramkumar

('71', 362, 1, 2, 733214) Bangar.
('71', 362, 1, 3, 733222) The office is at 65 Pathuriaghata Street.
('71', 362, 1, 4, 733264) The Secretary thus describes the process of phooka:
('71', 362, 2, 5, 733316) I have to inform you that the atrocities of phooka are perpetrated on
('71', 362, 3, 6, 733386) each milch animal twice daily.
('71', 362, 3, 7, 733417) The four legs of the animal are tied to four
('71', 362, 4, 8, 733462) strong posts and two men hold the animal so tightly that she cannot make
('71', 362, 5, 9, 733535) any movement of her limbs whatsoever.
('71', 362, 5, 10, 733573) A bamboo rod or pipe, 22 inches
('71', 362, 6, 11, 733605) long and 8 inches in circumference, is then forcibly pushed into the
('71', 362, 7, 12, 733674) generative organ of the animal, and then one man begins to blow air into
('71', 362, 8, 13, 733747) the uterus, causing it to be fully distended thereby.
('71', 362, 8, 14, 733801) This inflammation
('71', 362, 9, 15, 733819) causes extra pressure on the glands which helps the milkman to extract the
('71', 362, 10, 16, 733894) last drop of milk.
('71', 362, 10, 17, 733913) The milking also is indescribably cruel, and it is
('71', 362, 11, 18, 733964) continued to the great pain of the animal till blood comes out of the udder.
('71', 362, 12, 19, 734041) Sometimes a few drops of the blood get mixed up with the milk.
('71', 362, 12, 20, 734104) Unable to
('71', 362, 13, 21, 734114) make any movements, the animal silently bears this inhuman torture and
('71', 362, 14, 22, 734185) her great pain is manifested only by the copious perspiration and tears that
('71', 362, 15, 23, 734262) flow down her body and cheeks.
('71', 362, 15, 24, 734293) This is repeated twice daily and the animal
('71', 362, 16, 25, 734337) invaribly swoons after each operation.
('71', 362, 16, 26, 734376) It is difficult to conceive anything more torturing or revolting than the process described by the Secretary.
('71', 362, 16, 27, 734486) From the proceedings of a meeting of the Association it appears that the practice results in the sterility of the cows and she buffaloes subjected to the torture.
('71', 362, 16, 28, 734649) They are therefore transferred to butchers after they cease to yield milk even in spite of phooka.
('71', 362, 16, 29, 734748) The Association undertakes the prosecution of the torturers.
('71', 362, 16, 30, 734809) It engages plain clothes detectives to discover the culprits.
('71', 362, 16, 31, 734871) The activity of the Association is good as far as it goes.
('71', 362, 16, 32, 734930) But it does not appear to me to go far enough.
('71', 362, 16, 33, 734977) Punishment of a few criminals won't stop the inhumanity.
('71', 362, 16, 34, 735034) It is necessary to carry on propaganda among the offenders and educate them to understand the evils of the system.
('71', 362, 16, 35, 735149) Of course the surest way of dealing with the evil is for the Corporation to take charge of the whole of the milk supply of Calcutta and change the gwalas into its paid servants.
('71', 362, 16, 36, 735327) They would then not be open to temptation as they are now.
('71', 362, 16, 37, 735386) They will be under sanitary supervision.
('71', 362, 16, 38, 735427) Milking will be done under proper control.
('71', 362, 16, 39, 735470) The citizens will have a guarantee of having pure milk for their money.
('71', 362, 16, 40, 735542) And there is not the slightest reason why the milk supply department should not be self supporting.
('71', 362, 16, 41, 735642) The citizens will gladly pay an extra pie, if an increase in the selling price becomes necessary.
('71', 362, 16, 42, 735740) Of course the milk supply has to

('71', 365, 1, 6, 738936) She is charmed with the eternal snows which she sees daily.

('71', 372, 1, 2, 749029) I have listened to the Viceroy's statement most attentively, but I am sorry that I cannot make any statement.
('71', 372, 1, 3, 749139) The Working Committee will finally decide on July 5 on the grave issue that is before the country and I hope that no Congressman will want to anticipate the decision of the Working Committee and offer criticism.
('71', 372, 2, 4, 749351) The conversation then turned to the Segaon village and village folk.
('71', 372, 2, 5, 749420) Mahatma Gandhi said that the village had considerably improved and that there were better cows in the village than elsewhere in Wardha.
('71', 372, 2, 6, 749556) People were healthy and they had plenty of fresh air even more than he because they were bold people, not sophisticated.

('71', 372, 4, 9, 749738) SEGAON (WARDHA) June 23, 1937
('71', 372, 5, 10, 749768) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('71', 372, 5, 11, 749801) It is unfortunate but it is true that I have not been able to appreciate the utility of your method as a contribution to the communal tangle.
('71', 372, 5, 12, 749943) That does not mean that there is no value in cultural contact.
('71', 372, 5, 13, 750006) I think it has great value.
('71', 372, 5, 14, 750034) But I am more than doubtful as to the possibility of organizing such contact.
('71', 372, 5, 15, 750112) I do not know if I have expressed myself clearly.
('71', 372, 5, 16, 750162) Rabindranath has, of all the men of the world, perhaps, made the largest contribution in that direction.
('71', 372, 5, 17, 750267) But it has not been through any organization.
('71', 372, 5, 18, 750313) His writings have compelled attention.
('71', 372, 5, 19, 750352) I should be delighted if your writings serve the same purpose.
('71', 372, 5, 20, 750415) But then you do not need my certificate or anybody else's, even as the Poet does not.
('71', 372, 5, 21, 750501) I wonder if I have made my position clear.
('71', 372, 5, 22, 750544) I, somehow or other, feel that yours is a different position.
('71', 372, 5, 23, 750606) Maybe that I have not understood it and, therefore, I have been indifferent to it.
('71', 372, 5, 24, 750689) I would be satisfied if I can make you believe that my indifference is not due to cussedness or even to want of study of your thought expressed by you.
('71', 372, 5, 25, 750841) The moment I begin to appreciate your method you will find me advertising it in my own humble way.
('71', 372, 5, 26, 750940) But you seem to be paralysed without my advertisement and this hurts me.
('71', 372, 5, 27, 751013) Why should you need my advertisement?
('71', 372, 5, 28, 751051) Surely the names you have gathered round yourself are far better judges of your work than I ever can be.
('71', 372, 5, 29, 751156) It is easy enough now to answer your questions.
('71', 372, 5, 30, 751204) The solid work for villages that I have in mind is the work such as the Spinners' Association is doing among thousand of artisans irrespective of their caste or creed.
('71', 372, 5, 31, 751372) I hope to publish statistics showing
('71', 373, 0, 1, 751409) 374 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 373, 1, 2, 751451) the number of artisans with whom the Spinners' Association has established contactnot political but purely economic.
('71', 373, 1, 3, 751568) Of course, anyone who has faith in such kind of contact can work for it if he has the desire to learn the technique.
('71', 373, 1, 4, 751685) This work is necessarily confined to the villages because the bulk of these artisans are to be found in the villages and these are the people who are in need of the assistance of the kind we are offering.
('71', 373, 1, 5, 751890) The third and the fourth question are answered in the foregoing paragraphs.
('71', 373, 1, 6, 751966) The fifth question is answered in the preliminary paragraph.
('71', 373, 1, 7, 752027) You do not seem to have kept a copy of your letter.
('71', 373, 1, 8, 752079) I am, therefore, returning your letter in order to enable you to see if I have covered all your questions.
('71', 373, 1, 9, 752186) If I have not, you should tell me and I shall make another endeavour to answer your questions.

('71', 373, 5, 14, 752405) BHAI BHAGWANJI, It was good that you visited Vadavashram near Khambhat.
('71', 373, 5, 15, 752477) I can never feel hurt by anything you write.
('71', 373, 5, 16, 752522) How can there be any objection to your letting me know whatever you think?
('71', 373, 5, 17, 752597) As long as you are alive, how is it possible that the good name and reputation of Karsanji Mulchand would be lost?
('71', 373, 5, 18, 752712) How can I explain that I had spared no effort in writing to Bhai Narbheram about you?
('71', 373, 5, 19, 752798) I may not have told you that I had also entered into correspondence with Prof.
('71', 373, 5, 20, 752877) Thakore regarding the matter.
('71', 373, 5, 21, 752907) If I didn't do so, the reason must have been that there was nothing important in it.
('71', 373, 5, 22, 752992) But I had tried my level best.
('71', 373, 5, 23, 753023) I was not in a position to arbitrate in the dispute between you two.
('71', 373, 5, 24, 753092) I had neither the necessary material nor the time.
('71', 373, 5, 25, 753143) You have now sent a letter for Devchandbhai.
('71', 373, 5, 26, 753188) I do not know what I shall be able to do in that regard.
('71', 373, 5, 27, 753245) I am sending that letter to Devchandbhai.
('71', 373, 5, 28, 753287) I shall let you know if I get a reply from him.
('71', 373, 5, 29, 753335) And if I can do anything in the matter, I certainly will.

('71', 374, 2, 3, 753582) SEGAON, WARDHA, June 24, 1937
('71', 374, 3, 4, 753612) DEAR LORD LOTHIAN, My deepest thanks for your long letter 1. I appreciate the patient effort you are making to convince me of the correctness of your advice.
('71', 374, 3, 5, 753770) With much of what you say I wholly agree.
('71', 374, 3, 6, 753812) The question of office acceptance will now be finally decided at the forthcoming meeting of the Working Committee of the Congress.
('71', 374, 3, 7, 753943) The Viceroy has just said 2 the last word about the Government's attitude.
('71', 374, 3, 8, 754018) I admit that it is an improvement upon the first speech 3 on the situation by Lord Zetland.
('71', 374, 3, 9, 754110) Whatever the decision of the Working Committee may beand you will have known it before this reaches youwhat I would like to write upon is the fundamental difference between the colonies and India.
('71', 374, 3, 10, 754307) So far as I know, the colonists were armed and knew the use of arms.
('71', 374, 3, 11, 754376) The vast majority of thirty millions of voters here are unarmed, do not know the use of arms and perhaps would not like to be armed even if they were left absolutely free to do sosuch is Indian culture.
('71', 374, 3, 12, 754579) Though, therefore, I have pinned my faith to working along constitutional lines, I have, as every Indian has, either to think out a programme whereby every adult can be trained in the use of arms or find a substitute.
('71', 374, 3, 13, 754797) At my instance, the Congress has for the last eighteen years attempted to experiment with the substitute called non violent non co operation, civil resistance, etc.
('71', 374, 3, 14, 754962) For myself I have rejected the idea of achieving freedom by the use of arms in the last resort and I have accepted as its final substitute the use of non violence in every shape and form.
('71', 374, 3, 15, 755150) The use of arms is not an unexplored field, that of non violence has possibilities of infinite exploration.
('71', 374, 3, 16, 755258) Hence my eagerness to discover a formula whereby, consistently with the Congress creed of complete independence, office acceptance may be possible.
('71', 374, 3, 17, 755406) But I must confess that I have not the faith that you have in the possibility of the existing Act to expand into an instrument of complete freedom.
('71', 374, 3, 18, 755554) On the contrary, I believe in common with the vast majority of educated Indians that it is incapable of giving India what it wants and the sooner it is replaced by something of Indian design the better.

('71', 375, 0, 1, 755915) 376 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 375, 1, 2, 755957) Of course, the Act does contemplate militarization of India at a snail's pace and therefore it is not so repugnant to those overwhelming numbers of Indians who want India to develop military power as it is to me who would if I could take India along a wholly different route.
('71', 375, 1, 3, 756233) Now, if you think that my reasoning is erroneous and that it is possible for India to attain her full height without the back ground of either military training or of non violent training, you should come to India during next autumn if only to teach me.
('71', 375, 1, 4, 756487) In any case, if the Congress decides upon office acceptance it will be the beginning of real difficulty in one way and your coming is likely to be helpful.
('71', 375, 1, 5, 756643) If the Congress decides otherwise, you will perhaps yourself feel impelled to come here in order that you might not leave a single stone unturned to avert a calamity which it would be if the rule of the sword replaces the rule of the electorate, that is, democracy, however, incipient it might be.

('71', 375, 5, 11, 757050) June 24, 1937
('71', 375, 6, 12, 757064) KANTI, I got your letter.
('71', 375, 6, 13, 757090) I read also your letter to Mahadev.
('71', 375, 6, 14, 757126) The latter I consider an excellent letter.
('71', 375, 6, 15, 757169) You have been able to describe very vividly the struggle going on in your heart.
('71', 375, 6, 16, 757250) Your decision is of course good.
('71', 375, 6, 17, 757283) If you have determination, and indeed you have it, any college will be good for you.
('71', 375, 6, 18, 757368) But compared to Bombay, Bangalore is superior because there you will have more freedom.
('71', 375, 6, 19, 757456) The fact that the Principal has sent his son to Bombay counts little with me, for in doing so he has merely put a higher value on Bombay degrees.
('71', 375, 6, 20, 757602) For you such value has, and I think should have, secondary importance.
('71', 375, 6, 21, 757673) It is not the university that brings credit to a brilliant student but the latter that brings credit to a university.
('71', 375, 6, 22, 757791) There is a small village in England named Louth.
('71', 375, 6, 23, 757840) Tennyson was a pupil in that school and because of that even today the teachers of that school take great pride in it.
('71', 375, 6, 24, 757959) In the same way you should bring glory to the college in Bangalore.
('71', 375, 6, 25, 758027) What pains me particularly when I see people going to England or the West is that those who seek prestige for themselves by going to the West gain none, but, of course, they certainly raise the value of Western degrees.
('71', 375, 6, 26, 758247) One can understand that those who seek prestige do not gain any, for many who hold Western degrees remain
('71', 376, 0, 1, 758353) VOL.71 : 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 377
('71', 376, 1, 2, 758397) unemployed.
('71', 376, 1, 3, 758409) But anyone who has ability, whether he holds a degree from the East or from the West, does acquire prestige.
('71', 376, 1, 4, 758518) The late Dr. Tribhovandas was only an L.M.&S. He used to charge Rs. 1,000 a day as fee.
('71', 376, 1, 5, 758606) He was unrivalled both as physician and surgeon.
('71', 376, 1, 6, 758655) And in the art of restoring a nose that had been cut off, he has had no equal anywhere in the world.
('71', 376, 1, 7, 758756) The chief reason was that at that time dacoits had made it a custom to cut the noses of high officials.
('71', 376, 1, 8, 758860) Had Tribhovandas been diffident he would have called in some English doctor in such cases.
('71', 376, 1, 9, 758951) But being courageous he held the knife and the needle in his own hands and restored the noses in all or almost all cases.
('71', 376, 1, 10, 759073) If a man is honest, he is sure to become proficient through experience.
('71', 376, 1, 11, 759145) I have written all this to strengthen you in your decision, for people will continue to put before you all sorts of arguments that might persuade you to revise your decision.
('71', 376, 1, 12, 759320) Your aim is to acquire knowledge.
('71', 376, 1, 13, 759354) It is not as if after getting a degree one need gain no further knowledge.
('71', 376, 1, 14, 759429) It is possible that real knowledge is acquired only after getting a degree because that has been the experience of most people.
('71', 376, 1, 15, 759557) Regarding your lodging and boarding make whatever arrangement you think will suit you from the point of view of health and studies.
('71', 376, 1, 16, 759689) I did get Saraswati's letter and had also replied to her.
('71', 376, 1, 17, 759747) It is likely that the reply might have been delayed.
('71', 376, 1, 18, 759800) There is one sentence in your letter, "Some of the manners of the people over here seem very uncivilized." Who are those people?
('71', 376, 1, 19, 759929) Ba, Kanu and Kusum Desai are expected here the day after tomorrow.
('71', 376, 1, 20, 759996) It is cool now.
('71', 376, 1, 21, 760012) The first rains of the season have not been satisfactory.

('71', 377, 3, 4, 760324) KANAIYO,
('71', 377, 4, 5, 760333) I got your letter.
('71', 377, 4, 6, 760352) I will wait for you after the time limit you have fixed.
('71', 377, 5, 7, 760409) A sister from Madras had come here the day before yesterday and left the same day.
('71', 377, 5, 8, 760492) Pyarelal says that you know her.
('71', 377, 5, 9, 760525) Her name is Soundaram.
('71', 377, 5, 10, 760548) She had also brought her vina, which was worth Rs. 150. The chief reason of its high value was its decoration.
('71', 377, 5, 11, 760659) Without the decoration it would be worth only Rs. 80. But what I like most was her mastery in playing on the vina.
('71', 377, 5, 12, 760774) She sang, too, to the accompaniment of the vina.
('71', 377, 5, 13, 760823) Her voice is sweet.
('71', 377, 5, 14, 760843) During all that time I remembered you.
('71', 377, 5, 15, 760882) She said she would come again some other time.
('71', 377, 5, 16, 760929) You have not followed my questions about book keeping.
('71', 377, 5, 17, 760984) That only means that you have not understood the technical terms of book keeping.
('71', 377, 5, 18, 761066) So to that extent you probably do not know book keeping.
('71', 377, 5, 19, 761123) Show that letter to Narandas.
('71', 377, 5, 20, 761153) If he does not understand my terms, then I will have to admit that I do not know the technical language of book keeping and, therefore, could not use it correctly.
('71', 377, 5, 21, 761317) Narandas knows book keeping throughly well.
('71', 377, 5, 22, 761361) I learnt just enough of it for my legal practice, with my own effort, and it is possible, therefore, that I do not know the technical terms as well as an expert in book keeping.
('71', 377, 5, 23, 761539) In short, what I had asked from you was a summary, or 'abstract' as it is called in English, of the different accounts in the ledger.
('71', 377, 5, 24, 761673) If neither the register nor the abstracts are available here, we cannot know what the credit or debit balances are in the different accounts.
('71', 377, 5, 25, 761815) And such occasions are bound to arise when it becomes necessary to know the figures.
('71', 377, 5, 26, 761900) Do complete the accounts.
('71', 377, 5, 27, 761926) While you are there, try to perfect your knowledge of book keeping.
('71', 377, 5, 28, 761994) Similarly you may increase your knowledge of music as much as you wish to.
('71', 377, 5, 29, 762069) You are doing well in planning to go to Chorwad a little earlier.
('71', 377, 5, 30, 762135) Amtul Salaam's amount has been received.
('71', 377, 5, 31, 762176) I see that you go to bed at 11. I consider it too late.
('71', 377, 5, 32, 762232) Everybody should form the habit of going to bed by 10. But you should of course follow the convenience of others there.

('71', 378, 7, 10, 762742) BRIJKRISHNA, Enclosed is Deka's letter.
('71', 378, 7, 11, 762782) I wrote to you immediately after meeting him.
('71', 378, 7, 12, 762828) You must have got that letter 1. Convey your decision to him.
('71', 378, 7, 13, 762890) My idea was that you can call Deka for mazdoor seva 2 whenever you want to.
('71', 378, 7, 14, 762966) If you send for him for sundry other tasks mazdoor seva will suffer.
('71', 378, 7, 15, 763035) Deka himself holds that if he has to go to Delhi, and he would like to do so, he has to have some training at the Mazdoor Sangh.
('71', 378, 7, 16, 763164) Now the course has to be decided between you and Deka.
('71', 378, 7, 17, 763219) I remember having written to you on these lines.

('71', 380, 3, 7, 765455) I wonder if the Spanish bombing and the British are exactly alike.
('71', 380, 3, 8, 765522) How has the extent of the British damage been known?

('71', 380, 3, 10, 765642) Don't smile or be angry that I do not know these things so well as you do.
('71', 380, 3, 11, 765717) I can learn very little from the little I see of the newspapers.

('71', 380, 3, 14, 765872) Maybe these will throw some light.

('71', 383, 2, 5, 769832) I have no grouse against your literary pursuits but they should be secondary to physical labour.
('71', 383, 2, 6, 769929) Tolstoy says that his mind became pure only after he started doing eight hours of physical work every day and only then did his writing become pure.
('71', 383, 2, 7, 770078) Your case is the reverse of this.
('71', 383, 2, 8, 770112) You appear to have no interest at all in doing physical labour.
('71', 383, 2, 9, 770176) That is why I have been dissuading you from joining me.
('71', 383, 2, 10, 770232) You do not need to fast.
('71', 383, 2, 11, 770257) You must be at a place where there is some activity or other going on.
('71', 383, 2, 12, 770328) Only when you have worked hard and have tired yourself out physically should you pursue literary activity if at all.
('71', 383, 2, 13, 770445) Please consider this and write to me.

('71', 383, 4, 18, 770701) 464. UNFORTUNATE BUT INDISPENSABLE
('71', 383, 5, 19, 770736) The Secretary of the local Harijan Sevak Sangh of Jamshedpur applied to a lady among others for a subscription and he received the following reply:
('71', 383, 6, 20, 770884) It is some time since your letter of 5th February appealing for funds was
('71', 383, 7, 21, 770958) received by me.
('71', 383, 8, 22, 770974) I appreciate the good work your Association is doing at Jamshedpur, but, on principle, I cannot bring myself to send any subscription to any Association that calls itself 'Harijan' just because of the interpretation put upon that word in this country.
('71', 383, 9, 23, 771226) I am convinced that as long as any member of a society is classified by a
('71', 383, 10, 24, 771300) name that savours of inferiority, that section of society will never be raised.
('71', 383, 11, 25, 771380) would abolish from our vocabulary the words 'Harijan', 'Depressed Class', and
('71', 383, 12, 26, 771458) all such other appellations of the same meaning, which are used to distinguish
('71', 383, 13, 27, 771537) people who should never be separately described from their fellow beings.
('71', 383, 13, 28, 771611) The objection raised by the lady is not new.
('71', 383, 13, 29, 771656) The adoption of the name 'Harijan' was not a matter of choice, it was one of compulsion.
('71', 384, 0, 1, 771745) VOL.71 : 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 385
('71', 384, 1, 2, 771789) So long as the suppressed classes exist, it will be necessary to have some designation for them.
('71', 384, 1, 3, 771886) Thus Indians in South Africa were popularly distinguished from the rest as 'coolies' or 'sammies'.
('71', 384, 1, 4, 771985) This was resented by them.
('71', 384, 1, 5, 772012) Protests were made with more or less effect not against a distinguished name but against a name which in itself carried reproach and signified inferiority.
('71', 384, 1, 6, 772168) So ultimately they came to be classified as Indians as they should have been from the beginning.
('71', 384, 1, 7, 772265) Even thus were untouchables called by various names denoting reproach and inferiority.
('71', 384, 1, 8, 772352) The Government officers have devised names such as 'depressed', 'backward'.
('71', 384, 1, 9, 772428) Now they are known as 'scheduled classes'.
('71', 384, 1, 10, 772471) For the reformers, the name 'Harijan' was suggested by someone who belonged to the suppressed classes.
('71', 384, 1, 11, 772574) And that name has been adopted by the Harijan Sevak Sangh, being in its meaning absolutely free from reproach and even fitting in the sense that the despised of man are the dear ones of God, which is what 'Harijan means.
('71', 384, 1, 12, 772795) What, therefore, is possible and is being done is to remove the last trace of inferiority, but it is not possible to do away with a special name for those whose inferiority is abolished even from the hearts of caste Hindus, so long as the necessity for knowing the liberated ones from the rest exists.
('71', 384, 1, 13, 773097) I hope, therefore, that the objecting lady will recognize the inevitability of a separate designation for the suppressed class, but appreciate the fact that the word chosen by the Sangh has absolutely no reproach about it, and therefore give her subscription and become an active helper in a cause than which none can be found worthier.

('71', 384, 2, 15, 773453) 465. ARE THERE DIFFERENT OATHS?
('71', 384, 3, 16, 773485) On reading my article 1 on 'Religious Oath and Non religious', a Quaker friend wrote to a common friend who has passed on the letter to me.
('71', 384, 3, 17, 773625) I copy the letter 2 below:
('71', 384, 4, 18, 773652) It appears to me that Mr. Gandhi is dealing with two quite distinct questions in this article.
('71', 384, 4, 19, 773747) I wholly agree with his answer to one of them as, with due respect, I wholly disagree with the other .
('71', 384, 4, 20, 773850) I agree wholly with him that a Congressman need not worry over the propriety of the oath.
('71', 384, 4, 21, 773940) 2. But the Mahatma's subtle mind is too much for me when he draws distinctions between religious and non religious oaths.
('71', 384, 4, 22, 774062) At any rate we simple
('71', 384, 5, 23, 774084) 1 Vide Religious Oath and Non Religious,22 5 1937 2 Only extracts are reproduced here.
('71', 385, 0, 1, 774171) 386 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 385, 1, 2, 774213) Quakers look at it thus: Religion is man's search for God, and his reference of all life to the life of God.
('71', 385, 1, 3, 774322) An affirmation, or promise, to tell the truth and do the truth, is a reference of the self back to the life of God, for Truth is a part of Gods essential nature.
('71', 385, 1, 4, 774484) Therefore all such promises are religious acts.
('71', 385, 1, 5, 774532) The Quakers object to oaths, because they claim to be religious people, that is, people who fear God, and intend to observe the truth without swearing in the name of God.
('71', 385, 1, 6, 774703) As you know, after a long struggle and much suffering they obtained the right to affirm instead of swearing.
('71', 385, 1, 7, 774812) But affirmation or oath, both are for us religious acts; unless by religion one means something apart from the most part of life.
('71', 385, 1, 8, 774942) I should not agree that a Court of Law or a Parliament was something apart from religion for a religious man.
('71', 385, 1, 9, 775052) We, Quakers, are clear that all life is religious for the religious man, and have no particular use for a segregated 'religion' .
('71', 385, 2, 10, 775182) Cuttings from two Indian newspapers criticizing the article have also been sent to me.
('71', 385, 3, 11, 775269) What I find after reading the letter and the cuttings is that it is very difficult for me to make myself fully intelligible especially when I write on anything out of the way.
('71', 385, 3, 12, 775445) The only thing for me is to endeavour to elucidate my point so long as there is anything to elucidate.
('71', 385, 4, 13, 775548) I can see no subtlety about my argument.
('71', 385, 4, 14, 775589) But I see the clearest possible distinction between the oath or affirmation that a person takes before a court of law, a legislature and before his God perhaps daily at the time of rising and retiring.
('71', 385, 4, 15, 775791) They have different functions, different incidences.
('71', 385, 4, 16, 775844) The Quaker friend in my opinion surrenders the whole position when he agrees with me in my interpretation of the legislative or constitutional oath.
('71', 385, 4, 17, 775993) His quarrel is purely over my designation of oaths.
('71', 385, 4, 18, 776045) If my designation is faulty, I would accept any other which succinctly shows the distinction I have pointed out and which the friend accepts by implication.
('71', 385, 4, 19, 776202) The mere linguistic meaning of the legislative oath is wholly different from the meaning that the law and tradition have given to it.
('71', 385, 4, 20, 776336) One not knowing the law and the tradition will certainly have the objection that Shri Shivprasad Gupta has raised.
('71', 385, 4, 21, 776451) Mere grammatical or linguistic meaning of a sentence divorced from its context and history has often been found erroneous and sometimes positively mischiev ous.
('71', 385, 4, 22, 776612) Therefore, knowing the context of the legislative oath, I had no hesitation in saying that there was not the slightest strain on or violation of truth when I suggested that a Congressman could, consis

('71', 386, 1, 2, 776858) tently with his creed of complete independence and his resolution of wrecking the Constitution Act, take the oath required by law shortly described by me as legislative.
('71', 386, 1, 3, 777028) And here again my statement must be interpreted in its context and historical perspective.
('71', 386, 1, 4, 777119) A Congressman entering the Legislature will strive for gaining complete independence working within the law, and so will he try to wreck the Act working within the law.
('71', 386, 1, 5, 777288) If he can work for its amendment, he can quite properly work for its repeal, i.e., wrecking.
('71', 386, 1, 6, 777381) Indeed his deadlocks also will be within the law.
('71', 386, 1, 7, 777431) And he won't be frightened or hang his head low if his opponent twits him by saying that he is after all working the Constitution.
('71', 386, 1, 8, 777562) He will not, must not, care so long as he knows his mind, hides nothing and is downright honest in all his dealings.
('71', 386, 1, 9, 777679) Of course I agree with the Quaker friend that for a religiously or spiritually minded man religion or rather religious attitude pervades all his thoughts, words and acts.
('71', 386, 1, 10, 777850) But having said this I must adhere to my statement that for the multitudinous purposes of life we find it necessary to distinguish our activities as social, political, mercantile, religious, etc.
('71', 386, 1, 11, 778046) These divisions can be extended almost to infinity.
('71', 386, 1, 12, 778098) But the seeker of God will apply his godly attitude even to his sports if he finds time for them.

('71', 386, 3, 15, 778241) June 26, 1937 I forgot to write to you about one thing.
('71', 386, 3, 16, 778297) You referred to Devdas's third child.
('71', 386, 3, 17, 778335) I agree with you that he should stop now.

('71', 386, 3, 20, 778445) I do not know who is greater sinner.
('71', 386, 3, 21, 778482) They passionately love each other.
('71', 386, 3, 22, 778517) And then love expresses itself in the painful fashion.
('71', 386, 3, 23, 778572) I suppose they cannot help themselves.
('71', 386, 3, 24, 778611) I know what an effort it is to exercise self restraint when physical love is let loose.
('71', 386, 3, 25, 778699) Duty separated us for long intervals.
('71', 386, 3, 26, 778737) That gave me time for thinking and disciplining myself.
('71', 386, 3, 27, 778793) After the appearance of Devdas I had fairly conquered the animal in me.
('71', 386, 3, 28, 778865) Intense public activity of an exacting nature cast upon me a burden which I could not carry at the some time as making additions to the family.
('71', 386, 3, 29, 779009) Thus did nature help me.
('71', 386, 3, 30, 779034) And my greatest good luck was that in Ba I had a companion who never tempted me, so far as I can recall.
('71', 386, 3, 31, 779139) Such is not the case with the present generation.
('71', 386, 3, 32, 779189) I do not know that it was better in my generation.
('71', 386, 3, 33, 779240) Ba is perhaps an exceptional woman.
('71', 386, 3, 34, 779276) So you see I have boundless charity for Devdas.
('71', 386, 3, 35, 779324) And yet how I wish the terrible burden on Lakshmi could be removed.

('71', 388, 16, 19, 781652) I have written to Ramjibhai.
('71', 388, 16, 20, 781681) If what you say is correct, it is painful.
('71', 388, 16, 21, 781724) But if the sentiments you have expressed in your letter to him are mere politeness, they do not become a satyagrahi.
('71', 388, 16, 22, 781841) A satyagrahis language is bound to be extremely courteous, but that courtesy is also full of truth.
('71', 388, 16, 23, 781941) You say: Seeing your step, new khadi workers like me in Kathiawar lose heart.
('71', 388, 16, 24, 782019) If you still think over the matter and change your opinion, please do so and reassure workers like me. You cannot be called a new khadi worker at all.
('71', 388, 16, 25, 782170) And a khadi worker like you would not lose courage because of a co workers fall but would become more firm, would dedicate himself more whole heartedly and cultivate greater efficiency.
('71', 388, 16, 26, 782356) But if you have really lost courage because of Ramjibhais giving up of khadi work,

('71', 389, 1, 4, 782634) For there are bound to be a good many hurdles in our khadi and other activities and, if our faith does not spring from within but is dependent on others, all our activities will fail.
('71', 389, 1, 5, 782818) There must be a few whose faith would be more immovable even than the Himalayas and would remain steadfast till death.

('71', 389, 4, 10, 783107) 472. A GREAT EXPERIMENT 1
('71', 389, 5, 11, 783133) The Ahmedabad Labour Union has of late started a great experiment which is likely to prove of great interest and importance to all labour organizations.
('71', 389, 5, 12, 783286) The essence of the experiment consists in training its members to a supplementary occupation in addition to their principal occupation in the mills so that in the event of a lock out, strike or loss of employment otherwise, they would always have something to fall back upon instead of being faced with the prospect of starvation.
('71', 389, 5, 13, 783617) A mill hands life is ever full of vicisssitudes.
('71', 389, 5, 14, 783666) Thrift and economy no doubt provide a sort of remedy and it would be criminal to neglect them.
('71', 389, 5, 15, 783761) But the savings thus made cannot carry one far, seeing that the vast bulk of our mill labourers are always struggling on the margin of bare subsistence.
('71', 389, 5, 16, 783914) Moreover it would never do for a working man during strike or unemployment to rest idly at home.
('71', 389, 5, 17, 784011) There is nothing more injurious to his morale and self respect than enforced idleness.
('71', 389, 5, 18, 784098) The working class will never feel secure or develop a sense of self assurance and strength unless its members are armed with an unfailing subsidiary means of subsistence to serve as a second string to their bow in a crisis.
('71', 389, 5, 19, 784322) The idea of a subsidiary occupation for the mill hands was first conceived by me during the eventful twenty three days strike of the Ahmedabad mill hands in the year 1918. It occurred to me then that if the strike was to be successful the mill hands must have an occupation that would maintain them wholly or partly.
('71', 389, 5, 20, 784639) They must not

('71', 390, 1, 2, 784802) rely upon doles.
('71', 390, 1, 3, 784819) During the strike many of them were employed on unskilled labour.
('71', 390, 1, 4, 784885) It was then that I mooted my suggestion to teach mill hands a subsidiary occupation.
('71', 390, 1, 5, 784970) But my suggestion remained a dead letter till the next strike came.
('71', 390, 1, 6, 785038) A sort of a beginning was made then.
('71', 390, 1, 7, 785075) But it was difficult to bring into being all of a sudden an effective organization for teaching subsidiary occupations.
('71', 390, 1, 8, 785195) With the end of the second strike died also the effort to find and teach suitable occupations.
('71', 390, 1, 9, 785290) An organized and systematic effort is now being made by the Labour Union in that direction.
('71', 390, 1, 10, 785382) Mill hands are being taught to select occupations which they can practise in their leisure hours at home and which would give them substantial relief in times of unemployment.
('71', 390, 1, 11, 785558) These are ginning, cleaning, carding and spinning of cotton, weaving, tailoring, soap and paper making, type setting, etc.
('71', 390, 1, 12, 785681) I hold that a working knowledge of a variety of occupations is to the working class what metal is to the capitalist.
('71', 390, 1, 13, 785798) A lobourers skill is his capital.
('71', 390, 1, 14, 785832) Just as the capitalist cannot make his capital fructify without the co operation of labour, even so the working man cannot make his labour fructify without the co operation of capital.
('71', 390, 1, 15, 786017) And if both labour and capital have the gift of intelligence equally developed in them and have confidence in their capacity to secure a fair deal, each at the hands of the other, they would get to respect and appreciate each other as equal partners in a common enterprise.
('71', 390, 1, 16, 786291) They need not regard each other as inherently irreconcilable antagonists.
('71', 390, 1, 17, 786365) But the difficulty is that whilst today capital is organized and seems to be securely entrenched, labour is not.
('71', 390, 1, 18, 786478) The intelligence of the working man is cramped by this soulless, mechanical occupation which leaves him little scope or chance to develop his mind.
('71', 390, 1, 19, 786626) It has prevented him from realizing the power and full dignity of his status.
('71', 390, 1, 20, 786704) He has been taught to believe that his wages have to be dictated by capitalists instead of his demanding his own terms.
('71', 390, 1, 21, 786824) Let him only be organized along right lines and have his intelligence quickened, let him learn a variety of occupations, and he will be able to go about with his head erect and never be afraid of being without means of sustenance.
('71', 390, 1, 22, 787055) It is the grossest of superstitions for the working man to believe that he is helpless before the employers.
('71', 390, 1, 23, 787164) The effort of the Labour Union in Ahmedabad is to dispel this superstition in a concrete manner.
('71', 390, 1, 24, 787261) Its experiment, therefore, ought to be welcomed by all concerned.
('71', 390, 1, 25, 787327) Success will depend on an inflexible determination on the part of the Labour Union to follow up the good beginning that has
('71', 391, 0, 1, 787451) 392 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 391, 1, 2, 787493) been made, with unflagging perseverance.
('71', 391, 1, 3, 787534) It must have the right sort of instructors who can arouse among the workers an intelligent interest in their work.
('71', 391, 1, 4, 787649) A handicraft plied merely mechanically can be as cramping to the mind and soul as any other pursuit taken up mechanically.
('71', 391, 1, 5, 787772) An unintelligent effort is like a corpse from which the sprit has departed.

('71', 391, 2, 7, 787866) 473. MY NOTES
('71', 391, 3, 8, 787880) IS IT THEN NO MISTAKE?
('71', 391, 3, 9, 787903) Many people seem to have been hurt on reading my note entitled My Mistake 1 .
('71', 391, 3, 10, 787981) Of course readers of Harijanbandhu are all Gujaratis.
('71', 391, 3, 11, 788035) But Gujaratis are scattered in all Provinces and among them those who are alert know the customs and practices of the people in whose midst they live.
('71', 391, 3, 12, 788186) I have received letters from such persons residing in places as far off as Malabar, Tamilnadu, Andhradesh and Karnataka.
('71', 391, 3, 13, 788307) All of them write that my presumption was correct.
('71', 391, 3, 14, 788358) In all these Provinces, amongst Hindus both high and low so called, not only do marriages take place between a maternal uncle and his niece (sisters daughter) but these marriages are highly estemed in most cases.
('71', 391, 3, 15, 788571) One correspondent asked for a lawyers opinion.
('71', 391, 3, 16, 788618) The lawyer wrote back that not only are such marriages customary in the South, but that they are also clearly sanctioned by law.
('71', 391, 3, 17, 788747) Thus, although the correction made by Professor Thakore does not to a certain extent hold good, the manner in which I drew my conclusion was nevertheless faulty.
('71', 391, 3, 18, 788909) The fact that what I had presumed happens to be true with regard to Hindu society, may be regarded as an accident.
('71', 391, 3, 19, 789024) From the fact that the children of a brother and sister are permitted to marry, I had no right to conclude that a girl could marry her maternal uncle.
('71', 391, 3, 20, 789175) Hence Professor Thakore has indeed done me a sevice.
('71', 391, 3, 21, 789228) I can understand the love of the gentlemen who have written to me having regard for my prestige.
('71', 391, 3, 22, 789325) I thank them for having informed me and I also compliment them for ascertaining the customs and practices of the Provinces in which they happen to reside.
('71', 391, 3, 23, 789480) Because such marriages are acceptable in the South, no one should conclude that the attempt to make them acceptable in places where they are prohibited, will be welcomed.
('71', 391, 3, 24, 789651) The field for marriages is so wide that where it is prohibited among relatives, there is hardly

('71', 392, 1, 2, 789819) any need for going against the prohibition.
('71', 392, 1, 3, 789863) The reforms which Hindu society needs are those concerning the breaking of inter caste barriers.
('71', 392, 1, 4, 789960) These restrictions are truly detrimental to social progress.
('71', 392, 1, 5, 790021) Hence it would be a real reform to permit inter provincial and inter caste marriages.

('71', 392, 6, 16, 790468) The idea was to bridge it.
('71', 392, 6, 17, 790495) The bridge was made but the rushing water destroyed the earth work in front of and behind the bridge.
('71', 392, 6, 18, 790597) The water might easily have destroyed Khandus and Prahlads houses if the rain had continued 1. Therefore at considerable expense the sluit is reduced to its original state.
('71', 392, 6, 19, 790770) But there is no rain worth speaking about.
('71', 392, 6, 20, 790813) And Bombay had already 30 inches!
('71', 392, 6, 21, 790847) Ba returns tomorrow.
('71', 392, 6, 22, 790868) Spinning by the women has restarted.

('71', 395, 8, 15, 794094) They had brought 112 mangoes from the bazaar in Wardha.
('71', 395, 8, 16, 794150) They were excellent.

('71', 395, 10, 32, 795050) It is by accepting office and working, that is, by taking charge of the machinery that Congress can achieve its purpose more rapidly and satisfactorily....

('71', 398, 3, 12, 798192) You have said nothing new in suggesting that the common language may be written in either script, Devanagari or Persian.
('71', 398, 3, 13, 798313) You will read my credo 2 in Harijan.
('71', 398, 3, 14, 798350) But the name Hindi will never be changed.
('71', 398, 3, 15, 798392) You might as well change your own name to please people!
('71', 398, 3, 16, 798449) Hindi is the original name.
('71', 398, 3, 17, 798477) It is the utmost one can do to adopt Hindustani violence in the air and this demand for the change of name not by an individual but by an institution is violence which ought not to be submitted to.
('71', 398, 3, 18, 798675) There is no logic or reason in it.

('71', 399, 9, 14, 799983) What weight need we attach to Shankars allegations?
('71', 399, 9, 15, 800035) He has always been like that.
('71', 399, 9, 16, 800065) You do not seem to have read the letter I wrote to him.
('71', 399, 9, 17, 800121) I have severely reprimanded him, though I have not written all that you said.
('71', 399, 9, 18, 800199) I will write that, too.
('71', 399, 9, 19, 800223) Write to Shantikumar and tell him that I will decide now.
('71', 399, 9, 20, 800281) You can send for a flask from Bombay.
('71', 399, 9, 21, 800319) How can you get an exactly similar One?
('71', 399, 9, 22, 800359) The goat seems to be proving a costly affair.I am in a fix.

('71', 400, 2, 4, 800820) NIMU, I got your letter last evening.
('71', 400, 2, 5, 800858) I am not thinking about you just now.
('71', 400, 2, 6, 800896) I have no doubt at all in my mind about the rightness of Ramdas going to S.A. I can think of no other way of helping him to build up his body.
('71', 400, 2, 7, 801039) The state of things you describe is dangerous.
('71', 400, 2, 8, 801086) He should not in any circumstances miss this opportunity of going to S.A. rather than be bed ridden here.
('71', 400, 2, 9, 801192) If he can build up his body into a fine state, everything else will get all right.
('71', 400, 2, 10, 801275) Your duty is to reassure him.
('71', 400, 2, 11, 801305) If you remain undecided, he will not be able to go anywhere in peace of mind.
('71', 400, 2, 12, 801383) There is nothing more to say for the moment.
('71', 400, 2, 13, 801428) Kanam is doing fine as if he had not left the place at all.

('71', 400, 6, 21, 801841) Regret inbility advance loan. I understand that you have not given him any assurance about the loan.
('71', 400, 6, 22, 801942) So I do not see any need for you giving it.

('71', 401, 9, 12, 802567) KRISHNACHANDRA, The doubt you have raised is extermely pertinent.
('71', 401, 9, 13, 802633) I cannot say now how I could dicate such a meaningless sentence.
('71', 401, 9, 14, 802698) 2 Read it as follows: "But it should never be taken that the ancestors of an adharmaja were all dharmaja themselves or that his future progeny will all be dharmaja." There is no harm in learning and practising hatha yoga for the sake of physical health, but all the instructors are not fully well versed in it.
('71', 401, 9, 15, 803009) It has also been my experience that those who do not know the science and techniques of hatha yoga can even cause harm.
('71', 401, 9, 16, 803129) Moreover, everyone is not capable of performing each and every asana.
('71', 401, 9, 17, 803199) All this simply means that you must use your discretion in the matter.

('71', 402, 2, 3, 803673) SEGAON, [Before July 3, 1937]
('71', 402, 3, 4, 803703) GANDHIJI: It involved intensive education, not in the three Rs, but in changed ways of thinking and changed ways of life.
('71', 402, 3, 5, 803825) To bring about that change in the people's mentality is a Herculean task.
('71', 402, 3, 6, 803899) But it is such because the way is the non violent way, the way of persuasion.
('71', 402, 3, 7, 803977) This method is any day slower than the method of compulsion, but it is also surer and stabler.
('71', 402, 4, 8, 804072) AMERICAN: But would it in any way help if the British were to retire?
('71', 402, 4, 9, 804142) Would you have been better if the British had retired 150 years ago?
('71', 402, 4, 10, 804211) I have no doubt.
('71', 402, 4, 11, 804228) We should begin anew and without at least the political handicap.
('71', 402, 4, 12, 804294) You talk of the pax Britannica.
('71', 402, 4, 13, 804326) I do not deny that they have introduced education of a sort, have built schools and colleges, and built an unrivalled railway system, But our difficulty is this, that whereas elsewhere all these things have made the countries prosperous, they have brought about an opposite result here.
('71', 402, 4, 14, 804613) Not only the wealth of the land but even our intelligence has been drained away.
('71', 402, 4, 15, 804694) The very life hope is gone.
('71', 402, 4, 16, 804722) I will not say that a miracle would happen the moment the British retire.
('71', 402, 4, 17, 804796) Only we shall begin our history anew.
('71', 402, 4, 18, 804834) India will then have her destiny in her own hands.
('71', 402, 4, 19, 804885) And mind you we do not want the British to go, if they will stay as friends and voluntary co operators.
('71', 402, 5, 20, 804989) But why, if they don't want this rule, do they tolerate it?
('71', 402, 5, 21, 805049) Why is a united will lacking?
('71', 402, 5, 22, 805079) There are numerous causes which I cannot go into now.
('71', 402, 5, 23, 805133) All have their share in it, but the root cause is perhaps indefinable.
('71', 402, 5, 24, 805204) The will is actively absent today, though indefinitely it is there.
('71', 402, 6, 25, 805272) Have the Government reserved to themselves power to overrule the people's will because they think that India is incapable of self government?
('71', 402, 7, 26, 805414) 1 This is extracted from "Weekly Letter" by Mahadev Desai, who had reported: "A youthful American was full of questions about the poverty of India, the meaning and reach of the village industries revival programme and the implications of the British rule in India.
('71', 402, 7, 27, 805679) To one accustomed to quick results, the village reconstruction programme is bound to look a tame affair.
('71', 402, 7, 28, 805784) But Gandhiji does not hesitate to tell all such people as he does our own people, that the programme is a Herculean task and takes a Herculean resolve to achieve it."
('71', 403, 0, 1, 805951) 404 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 403, 1, 2, 805993) I do not think so, nor do I suspect that even the British think so.
('71', 403, 1, 3, 806061) If they did so, they would not have drawn up this Constitution.
('71', 403, 1, 4, 806125) No, it is an honest effort to make Provinces autonomous.
('71', 403, 1, 5, 806182) Otherwise why should they arm an electorate of 30 millions with the power to vote?
('71', 403, 1, 6, 806265) The honest effort is, however, vitiated by the fact that simultaneous effort is being made to maintain the British connection practically by force.
('71', 403, 1, 7, 806413) And this they do for exploiting India, Harijan 3 7 1937

('71', 403, 2, 9, 806493) STRUNK 1
('71', 403, 3, 10, 806502) SEGOAN, [Before July 3, 1937]
('71', 403, 4, 11, 806532) GANDHIJI: What we mean by independence is that we will not live on the sufferance of any people on earth and that there is a big party in India which will die in vindicating this position.
('71', 403, 4, 12, 806721) But we will not die killing, though we might be killed.
('71', 403, 4, 13, 806777) It is a novel experiment, I know.
('71', 403, 4, 14, 806811) Herr Hitler, I know, does not accept the position of human dignity being maintained without the use of force.
('71', 403, 4, 15, 806921) Many of us feel that it is possible to achieve independence by non violent means.
('71', 403, 4, 16, 807003) It would be a bad day for the whole world if we had to wade through blood.
('71', 403, 4, 17, 807078) If India gains her freedom by a clash of arms, it will indefinitely postpone the day of real peace for the world.
('71', 403, 4, 18, 807192) History is a record of perpetual wars, but we are trying to make new history,and I say this as I represent the national mind so far as non violence is concerned.
('71', 403, 4, 19, 807354) I have reasoned out the doctrine of the sword, I have worked out its possibilities and come to the conclusion that man's destiny is to replace the law of the jungle with the law of conscious love.
('71', 403, 4, 20, 807551) The aspiration for independence is the aspiration that fires all nations in Europe.
('71', 403, 4, 21, 807635) But that independence does not exclude voluntary partnership.
('71', 403, 4, 22, 807697) Imperialistic ambition is inconsistent with partnerhip.
('71', 403, 5, 23, 807753) Strunk had heard vaguely about Gandhiji's view on machines, and Western civilization, Western medicine, etc.
('71', 403, 5, 24, 807862) He wanted to know them at first hand.
('71', 403, 6, 25, 807900) 1 This is extracted from "Weekly Letter" by Mahadev Desai, who had reproted: "Capt.
('71', 403, 6, 26, 807984) Strunk, representative of the official daily newspaper in Germany and a member of Hitler's staff, visited Segaon with a view to investigate conditions in India.
('71', 403, 6, 27, 808145) He wanted to know the content of independence and how far people of India seriously meant it."
('71', 404, 0, 1, 808240) VOL.71 : 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 405
('71', 404, 1, 2, 808284) G. I have said that we cannot accept Western models holusbolus.
('71', 404, 1, 3, 808348) I do not believe in mechanization of India.
('71', 404, 1, 4, 808392) I think that rural reconstruction is possible!
('71', 404, 2, 5, 808439) STRUNK: Are you lilely to change these views after you have gained your objective of independence?
('71', 404, 2, 6, 808538) These views represent my permanent convictions.
('71', 404, 2, 7, 808586) But my opposition to machinery, railways, etc., does not mean that as soon as we are independent we should uproot all of them.
('71', 404, 2, 8, 808713) They will be used for the benefit of the nation instead of the strategic military purpose they are principally meant to fulfil today.
('71', 404, 3, 9, 808847) S. Sometimes you direct your speech against Western sanitation and Western
('71', 404, 4, 10, 808922) surgery.
('71', 404, 4, 11, 808931) What is your future plan with regard to India?
('71', 404, 4, 12, 808978) G. I am glad you have asked the question.
('71', 404, 4, 13, 809020) I have said nothing with regard to Western sanitation.
('71', 404, 4, 14, 809075) In fact I derived my idea of rural sanitation from Poore, an English doctor, and I have copied it here.
('71', 404, 4, 15, 809179) But I have spoken against Western medicine which I have called the concentrated essence of black magic.
('71', 404, 4, 16, 809283) My view springs out of my non violence, for my soul rebels against vivisection.
('71', 404, 4, 17, 809363) You do not know that I had very nearly taken the medical line when in order to respect the wishes of my dead father I took up law.
('71', 404, 4, 18, 809494) But in South Africa I again thought of medicine.
('71', 404, 4, 19, 809543) When I was told I should have to do vivisection, my soul rebelled against it.
('71', 404, 4, 20, 809621) Why should, I said, have to practise cruelty on lower animals which I would never practise upon myself?
('71', 404, 4, 21, 809725) But I do not despise all medical treatment.
('71', 404, 4, 22, 809769) I know that we can learn a lot from the West about safe maternity and the care of infants.
('71', 404, 4, 23, 809860) Our children are born anyhow and most of our women are ignorant of the science of bringing up children.
('71', 404, 4, 24, 809964) Here we can learn a good deal from the West.
('71', 404, 4, 25, 810009) But the West attaches an exaggerated importance to prolonging man's earthly existence.
('71', 404, 4, 26, 810096) Until the man's last moment on earth you go on drugging him even by injecting.
('71', 404, 4, 27, 810175) That, I think, is inconsistent with the recklessness with which they will shed their lives in war.
('71', 404, 4, 28, 810274) Though I am opposed to war, there is no doubt that war induces reckless courage.
('71', 404, 4, 29, 810355) Well, without ever having to engage in a war I want to learn from you the art of throwing away my life for a noble cause.
('71', 404, 4, 30, 810477) But I do not want that excessive desire of living that Western medicine seems to encourage in man even at the cost of tenderness for subhuman life.
('71', 404, 4, 31, 810625) However, I like the emphasis the Western medical science places upon prevention of disease.
('71', 405, 0, 1, 810717) 406 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 405, 1, 2, 810759) S. There is so much over production of intelligence in India and so much educated unemployment.
('71', 405, 1, 3, 810855) Could not this army of educated young men be utilized by being sent to the villages?
('71', 405, 1, 4, 810940) G. That movement has commenced.
('71', 405, 1, 5, 810972) But it is only in its infancy.
('71', 405, 1, 6, 811003) And then there is no over production of intelligence but over production of degrees.
('71', 405, 1, 7, 811088) The brain power has not at all increased, only the art of memorizing has been stimulated, and these degrees can't be carted to the villages.
('71', 405, 1, 8, 811229) Only the brains, if there are any left, can be used.
('71', 405, 1, 9, 811282) This reading for degrees has deprived us of initiative.
('71', 405, 1, 10, 811338) It makes us upfit to go to the villages.
('71', 405, 1, 11, 811379) The mechanical university study deprives us of the desire for originality; years of memorizing causes a fatigue of the mind that makes most of us fit for clerical work.
('71', 405, 1, 12, 811548) Nevertheless the village movement has come to stay.
('71', 405, 2, 13, 811600) As Capt.
('71', 405, 2, 14, 811609) Strunk prepared to leave, Gandhiji introduced him to Mr. Kallenbach.
('71', 405, 2, 15, 811678) G. Here is a live Jew and a German Jew, if you please.
('71', 405, 2, 16, 811733) He was a hot pro German during the War.
('71', 405, 3, 17, 811773) Strunk was surprised to see a German Jew sitting there barebodied and in
('71', 405, 4, 18, 811846) a khadi dhoti.
('71', 405, 4, 19, 811861) G. Then I should like to understand from you why the Jews are being persecuted in Germany.
('71', 405, 5, 20, 811952) Strunk tried to explain.
('71', 405, 5, 21, 811977) So many Jews had taken part during the War and
('71', 405, 6, 22, 812024) Germany had nothing to say against them.
('71', 405, 6, 23, 812065) It is the Jews who overran Germany after
('71', 405, 7, 24, 812106) the War, who ousted Germans from their jobs, and who "guided" the fight against
('71', 405, 8, 25, 812186) Hitler that were not being tolerated.
('71', 405, 9, 26, 812224) S. I personally think we have just overdone it.
('71', 405, 9, 27, 812272) That's the mistake revolutions always do.
('71', 405, 9, 28, 812314) Oh, there is such a lot of hate in Europe.
('71', 405, 9, 29, 812357) And it has reached its climax in Spain.
('71', 405, 9, 30, 812397) It is cruel, heartless, stupid, inhumanthis Spanish War.
('71', 405, 9, 31, 812454) It can't be compared with any other war.
('71', 405, 10, 32, 812495) Harijan, 3 7 1937
('71', 405, 11, 33, 812513) 494. HINDI V. URDU
('71', 405, 12, 34, 812532) A correspondent says a great deal is being written against me in the Urdu Press in regard to my attitude towards Urdu.
('71', 405, 12, 35, 812651) They even go so far to suggest that though I speak about Hindu Muslim unity I am the most communally minded of all the Hindus.
('71', 406, 0, 1, 812778) VOL.71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 407
('71', 406, 1, 2, 812821) I have no desire to defend myself against the suggestion referred to by my correspondent.
('71', 406, 1, 3, 812911) My life must be my credentials on my attitude regarding the Hindu Muslim question.
('71', 406, 1, 4, 812994) But the Hindi Urdu question is an evergreen.
('71', 406, 1, 5, 813039) Though I have expressed my views often enough on this question, they will bear repetition.
('71', 406, 1, 6, 813130) I shall simply enunciate my belief without advancing any argument in support.
('71', 406, 1, 7, 813208) I believe that 1. Hindi, Hindustani and Urdu are words denoting the same language spoken in the North by Hindus and Mussalmans and written in either Devanagari or Perisian script; repetition.
('71', 406, 1, 8, 813400) I shall simply enunciate my belief without advancing any argument in support.
('71', 406, 1, 9, 813478) I believe that 1. Hindi, Hindustani and Urdu are words denoting the same language spoken in the North by Hindus and Mussalmans and written in either Devanagari or Persian script; 2. Hindi was the name for this language used both by Hindus and Mussalmans before the word Urdu came to be used; 3. the word Hindustani also came to be used later (the date unknown to me) to denote the same speech; 4. both Hindus and Mussalmans should try to speak the language as understood by the vast mass of the people in the North; 5. at the same time many Hindus and many Mussalmans will persist in using Sanskrit words and persian or Arabic words respectively and exclusively.
('71', 406, 1, 10, 814141) This we shall have to bear so long as mutual distrust and aloofness continue.
('71', 406, 1, 11, 814219) Those Hindus who care to know a certain class of Mussalman thought will study Urdu written in Persian script, and similarly those Mussalmans who care to know a certain class of Hindu thought will study Hindi written in Devanagari script; 6. ultimately when our hearts have become one and we all are proud of India as our country, rather than our Provinces, and shall know and practise different religions as derived from one common source, as we know and relish different fruits of the same tree, we shall reach a common language with a common script whilst we shall retain provincial languages for provincial use; 7. the attempt to force one script or one form of Hindi on any Province or district or people is detrimental to the best interest of the country; 8. the common language question should be viewed apart from the religious differences;
('71', 407, 0, 1, 815067) 408 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 407, 1, 2, 815109) 9. Roman script cannot and should not be the common script of India.
('71', 407, 1, 3, 815178) The rivalry can only be berween Persian and Devanagari.
('71', 407, 1, 4, 815234) Apart from its intrinsic merit the latter should be the common script for all India because most of the provincial scripts have their origin in Devanagari and it is for them by far the easiest to learn.
('71', 407, 1, 5, 815437) At the same time no attempt whatsoever should be made to foist it upon Mussalmans and for that matter on those others who do not know it.
('71', 407, 1, 6, 815575) 10. I served the cause of Urdu, if it may be distinguished from Hindi, when at Indore 1 the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan at my instance accepted the definition given in Clause I, and when at Nagpur 2 at my instance the Bharatiya Sahitya Parishad accepted the definition and called the common langugage of inter provincial intercourse Hindi or Hindustani, thus giving fullest scope to both Mussalmans and Hindus to identify themselves with the effort to enrich the common language and to interpret the best provincial thought in that language.

('71', 407, 2, 8, 816130) 495. A PLEA FOR THE VILLAGE CART
('71', 407, 3, 9, 816163) Shri Ishverbhai S. Amin of Baroda sends me a long note on animal power v.
('71', 407, 3, 10, 816237) machine power.
('71', 407, 3, 11, 816252) From it I copy the following relevant portion 3 .
('71', 407, 4, 12, 816302) Animal power is not costlier than machine power in fields or short distance work and hence can compete with the latter in most cases.
('71', 407, 4, 13, 816436) The present day tendency is towards discarding animal power in preference to machine power.
('71', 407, 5, 14, 816528) Take for example a bullock driven cart, costing Rs. 100 and Rs. 200 for the bullocks.
('71', 407, 5, 15, 816614) The bullocks can drive the cart at least 15 miles per day with a load of 16 Bengal maunds on rough sandy village roads.
('71', 407, 5, 16, 816734) This service will cost....
('71', 407, 5, 17, 816761) in total Rs. 1/6 per day., A one ton motor lorry will cost for 15 mles ....
('71', 407, 5, 18, 816837) Rs. 2/12, i.
('71', 407, 5, 19, 816850) e., Rs 1/6 per cartload of 16 Bengal maunds ....
('71', 407, 5, 20, 816899) A moror lorry may compete when it has to carry loads at a stretch for a long distance on a good metal road, where bullock carts seem too slow and uneconomical....
('71', 407, 5, 21, 817062) It is the slowness only which goes againjst the bulocks cart....
('71', 407, 5, 22, 817127) If a farmer has his own cart and travels in it, he has not to spend anything in the form of ready money but uses the produce of his own field in producing power by feeding bullocks.
('71', 407, 5, 23, 817309) Really grass and grain should be looked upon by the farmer as his petrol, and the cart the motor lorry, and bullocks the engine converting grass into power.
('71', 407, 5, 24, 817466) The machine will neither consume grass nor will it yield manure,
('71', 407, 6, 25, 817531) 1 In April 1935. 2 In April 1936. 3 Only extracts are reproduced here.

('71', 408, 1, 2, 817645) an article of vast importance.
('71', 408, 1, 3, 817676) Then the villager has to have his bullocks; in any case he has his grass.
('71', 408, 1, 4, 817750) And if he has a cart, he is maintaining the village carpenter and the blacksmith; and if he is keeping a cow, he is maintaining a hydrogenation plant converting vagetabele oil into solid butter or ghee and also at the same time a bullock manufacturing machine thus serving a twofold purpose.
('71', 408, 1, 5, 818042) The invasion of the motor lorry may or may not succeed.
('71', 408, 1, 6, 818098) It would be wisdom if intelligent workers will study the pros and cons and definitely guide the villagers.
('71', 408, 1, 7, 818205) Shri Ishverbhais note should pro voke the thought of all village workers in the direction indicated in it.

('71', 408, 2, 9, 818330) 496. WHAT SHOULD BE DONE?
('71', 408, 2, 10, 818356) The letter, notice and application quoted below 1 are well worth reading.
('71', 408, 2, 11, 818430) I have omitted names and addresses.
('71', 408, 2, 12, 818466) The correspondent who has written this letter is devoted to ahimsa.
('71', 408, 2, 13, 818534) This question is pertinent.
('71', 408, 2, 14, 818562) One who resists the oppressor is, to some extent, saved; but one who has no strength to resist gets beaten.
('71', 408, 2, 15, 818670) What should a devotee of ahimsa do in such circumstances?
('71', 408, 2, 16, 818728) Should the oppressed be advised to hit back or at least take the matter to the court?
('71', 408, 2, 17, 818814) Both these proceedings are lawful.
('71', 408, 2, 18, 818849) The law allows a person to defend himself if he is illegally assaulted.
('71', 408, 2, 19, 818921) He of course has the right to go to the court.
('71', 408, 2, 20, 818968) But a devotee of ahimsa will not give such advice.
('71', 408, 2, 21, 819019) He believes that tit for tat is not the true way of ending oppression in the world.
('71', 408, 2, 22, 819103) The world has hitherto followed this path; but it has not reduced oppression only its forms may have changed.
('71', 408, 2, 23, 819213) As devotee of ahimsa will advise the oppressed to resort to non co operation.
('71', 408, 2, 24, 819291) No one can be compelled to slave for another.
('71', 408, 2, 25, 819337) Hence those Harijans who are oppressed should learn to quit the oppressors lands.
('71', 408, 2, 26, 819419) The questions naturally arises: Where should they go after quitting these lands?
('71', 408, 2, 27, 819500) It is the duty of a Harijan sevak to find some work or other for such helpless Harijans.
('71', 408, 2, 28, 819589) This should not be difficult.
('71', 408, 2, 29, 819619) The path of ahimsa is no doubt difficult, but its ultimate result is permanent and beneficial to both.
('71', 408, 2, 30, 819722) The world has been returning blow for a blow, but it has neither enhanced happiness not removed injustice and oppression.
('71', 408, 2, 31, 819844) My experience tells me that the only way to remove these is ahimsa.
('71', 408, 3, 32, 819912) 1 Not reproduced here.
('71', 408, 3, 33, 819935) They described the harassment of Harijan labourrers by landlords in villages.
('71', 408, 3, 34, 820013) The correspondent had asked whether the labourers should be advised to retaliate.
('71', 409, 0, 1, 820095) 410 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 409, 1, 2, 820137) What I have said is the ultimate remedy.
('71', 409, 1, 3, 820178) But after deciding that blow is no answer for blow and before advising non co operation, the non violent worker will approach the landlords and endeavour to explain to them their duty.
('71', 409, 1, 4, 820363) It may well be that the landlords may melt a little.
('71', 409, 1, 5, 820416) Public opinion can be roused against such oppression when the oppressor becomes stubborn and refuses to listen to anyone; then the best remedy is non co operation, that is, getting on without him.
('71', 409, 1, 6, 820613) It need not be feared that when oppressed Chamars resort to non co operation the other castes would join hands with the oppressor.
('71', 409, 1, 7, 820744) At the moment the question is only of the oppressed.
('71', 409, 1, 8, 820797) If others do join hands, they too can be taught the lesson of non co operation.

('71', 409, 8, 19, 821349) Students have always the problem of how to spend their school vacations.
('71', 409, 8, 20, 821422) Shri Narnadas Gandhis letter quoted below 1 tells us how some students of the Rajkot National School spent their vacation.
('71', 409, 9, 21, 821545) 1 The letter is not translated here.
('71', 409, 9, 22, 821582) The correspondent had recounted how two students spun 200 hanks during their vacation lasting 62 days.
('71', 409, 9, 23, 821685) Ten students and one teacher lived a very simple life working amongst six villages near Rajkot.
('71', 409, 9, 24, 821781) In this group, there were two Harijan boys and one Khoja boy and the response from the

('71', 410, 1, 2, 821911) I would look upon this programme as a commendable one.
('71', 410, 1, 3, 821966) In this way students gained prectical knowledge and developed their intellect, as the work they did seems to have been done intelligently and with keen zest.
('71', 410, 1, 4, 822124) Very often during vacations students spend huge sums on railway fares and travel to distant places and return empty handed.
('71', 410, 1, 5, 822248) It will be no small gain if they come to know the villages and the villagers in their own neighbourhood, serve them and carry out propaganda for the charkha and sanitation.

('71', 415, 2, 3, 829352) APPENDIX I
('71', 415, 3, 4, 829363) RESOLUTION PASSED AT A.I.C.C. MEETING, DELHI 1
('71', 415, 4, 5, 829410) March 16, 1937
('71', 415, 5, 6, 829425) The All India Congress Committee records its high appreciation of the magnificent response of the country to the call of the Congress during the recent elections and the approval by the electorate of the Congress policy and programme.
('71', 415, 5, 7, 829660) The Congress entered these elections with its objective of independence and its total rejection of the new Constitution; and the demand for a Constituent Assembly to frame Indias Constitution.
('71', 415, 5, 8, 829853) The declared Congress policy was to combat the new Act and end it.
('71', 415, 5, 9, 829920) The electorate has, in an overwhelming majority, set its seal of approval on this policy and programme, and the new Act, therefore, stands condemned and utterly rejected by the people through the self same democratic process which has been invoked by the British Government, and the people have further declared that they desire to frame their own constitution, based on national independence, through the medium of a Constituent Assembly elected by adult franchise.
('71', 415, 5, 10, 830387) This Committee, therefore, demands on behalf of the people of India that the new Constitution be withdrawn.
('71', 415, 5, 11, 830495) In the event of the British Government still persisting with the new Constitution in defiance of the declared will of the people, the All India Congress Committee desire to impress upon all Congress members of the Legislatures that their work inside and outside the Legislatures must be based on the fundamental Congress policy of combating the new Constitution and seeking to end it, a policy on the basis of which they sought the suffrage of the electorate and won their overwhelming victory in elections.
('71', 415, 5, 12, 831003) That policy must inevitably lead to deadlocks with the British Government and bring out still further the inherent antagonism between British Imperialism and Indian Nationalism and expose the autocratic nature of the new Consititution.
('71', 415, 6, 13, 831239) THE BACKGROUND
('71', 415, 7, 14, 831254) While the British Governments reform as proposed in the Government of India Act (1935) had been totally rejected by the Bombay Congress session, at the Working Committee meeting held at Allahabad in April, 1936, the members differed widely in their views on the subject of office acceptance.
('71', 415, 7, 15, 831546) In the absence of a consensus, it was decided to review the matter after the elections in February, 1937. When the results of the elections were announced, the Congress had the majority of seats in five Provinces, namely, Madras, the United Provinces, the Central Provinces, Bihar and Orissa.
('71', 415, 7, 16, 831839) It was the biggest single Party in four Provinces,

('71', 416, 1, 3, 832140) In the Legislative Assmeblies of Sind and the Punjab, the Congress was in a minority.

('71', 416, 15, 19, 832566) Orissa 60 36 The following is extracted from the resolution passed by the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee in Madras on March 10, 1937: The Tamil Nadu Congress Committee is convinced on good grounds that the people of this Province, who have expressed their unqualified confidence in the Congress leadership, are strongly and definitely in favour of the Congress Party accepting ministerial responsibilities with a view to carrying out the policy of the Congress and the programme laid down in the Congress manifesto, and that they will be extremely disappointed if any other decision is adopted.
('71', 416, 15, 20, 833160) The Provincial Congress Committee is of the opinion that accepting the ministerial offices by the Congress in Legislatures will strengthen the Congress Party and develop the sanctions necessary for achieving the Congress goal, by creating the psychology of confidence between the masses and the forces of repression that have been hitherto employed against them by the bureaucracy .
('71', 416, 15, 21, 833543) The Provincial Congress Committee therefore is clearly of the opinion that in all the Provinces where Congressmen are in majorities in Provincial Legislatures, so as to enable them to function as stable Ministries without having to depend upon doubtful non Congress groups, the Congressmen should accept ministerial offices on behalf of the Party.
('71', 416, 16, 22, 833891) In his speech on the A.I.C.C. resolution, C. Rajagopalachari said:
('71', 416, 17, 23, 833958) Let us not distrust each other.
('71', 416, 17, 24, 833990) Do not think we are hankering after jobs .
('71', 416, 17, 25, 834033) When they went to the Governor they had to tell him what they proposed to
('71', 417, 0, 1, 834107) 418 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 417, 1, 2, 834149) do and ask him if he would use his special powers.
('71', 417, 1, 3, 834200) If the Governor refused to give an answer, they would come back.
('71', 417, 1, 4, 834265) If he said he would use them, then also as self respecting men they would come back; but if he said he would not use them, they would take his words at their face value.
('71', 417, 1, 5, 834435) If later he broke those words, they could come out.
('71', 417, 2, 6, 834487) Jawaharlal Nehru said that though he also continued the opposition .
('71', 417, 2, 7, 834556) he eventually agreed again in deference to the wishes of Mahatma Gandhi and with a view to keeping up solidarity, which, in his view, was essential to fight the new Constitution.
('71', 417, 3, 8, 834735) The A.I.C.C. then took up consideration of the draft of the oath which every Congress Legislator will be required to take affirming allegiance to Congress and the country on the first day of the National Convention Session. The draft, prepared by Jawaharlal Nehru and revised by Gandhiji, read:
('71', 417, 4, 9, 835030) I, Member of this All India Convention, pledge myself to the service of India and to work in the Legislatures and outside for the independence of India and the ending of the exploitation and poverty of her people.
('71', 417, 4, 10, 835244) I pledge myself to work under the discipline of the Congress for the furtherance of Congress ideals and objectives to the end that India may be free and independent and her millions freed from the heavy burdens they suffer from.
('71', 417, 5, 11, 835473) Pattabhi Sitaramayya explains thus the question of assurances:
('71', 417, 6, 12, 835536) Apart from the question of the academic and theoretical issues involved in this affair, it would be just as well to study in detail the significance of the demands made by the Congress that the Governors shall not use their special powers of interference or set aside the advice of Ministers in regard to the constitutional activities.
('71', 417, 6, 13, 835872) These special powers relate to certain groups, interests and areas.
('71', 417, 6, 14, 835940) The groups are the minorities, the interests are the vested interests of the British and the areas are the excluded and the semi excluded areas in British India, and the Indian States.
('71', 417, 6, 15, 836125) By this demand it is meant that the Governors should only act like the Governors in the Provinces of Australia (Section 51).
('71', 417, 6, 16, 836250) They should not have the power to dismiss Ministers at their pleasure, that the salaries should be fixed as desired by the leader of the House (Section 50), that they should not preside over the Council of Ministers, that they should not interfere or make Ordinances (Section 55 88), or Acts on grounds of menace to peace and tranquillity, that they had nothing to do with the appointment of Advocate General (Section 56), or with the making of the police rules: (Section 57) with violent crimes (  59) with the framing of rules of business allocating the duties of Ministers (  62) dissolving the Assembly (  74) introduction of Bills (  75) assenting to Bills

('71', 418, 3, 5, 837612) LORD LOTHIANS LETTER TO THE TIMES 1
('71', 418, 4, 6, 837648) The statement 2seems to be based on a complete misunderstanding of the way in which the system of responsible government works in practice and of paragraphs 7 and 8 of the Instrument of Instructions to Governors.
('71', 418, 5, 7, 837861) Responsible government has been the method by which the Canadian and Australian Federation and South Africa and New Zealand each have attained full national self government by constitutional means, often in the early days against the opposition both of Governors and the British Government.
('71', 418, 5, 8, 838152) In every case the Governor or Governor General was endowed with veto powers and other responsibilities of his own.
('71', 418, 6, 9, 838267) I venture to assert that in no case has a Ministry possessed of a majority in the Legislature asked, and that it certainly never received, any assurance that the Governor would not use his special powers.
('71', 418, 6, 10, 838472) Yet these powers and responsibilities in the hands of Governors have not prevented steady advance to full self government.
('71', 418, 7, 11, 838595) That is because the issue turns not so much on the legal power as on the responsibilitythat responsibility, Mr. Gandhi once told me himself, was Indias first need to exercise.
('71', 418, 8, 12, 838771) I do not think, therefore, that Mr. Gandhi had hitherto any legitimate ground for saying that the British Government flouted the majority or failed to give effect to the principle of provincial autonomy.

('71', 419, 1, 2, 839098) Governors simply acted in the manner always contemplated at the Round Table Conference and repeatedly proclaimed by Ministers as being the ordinary practice under the system of responsible Government.
('71', 419, 2, 3, 839299) I am sure that British public opinion hopes and expects that majorities returned by the new electorate will take over responsibility under the Constitution for the Government of their Provinces.
('71', 419, 2, 4, 839494) If Congress leaders take the course ordinarily adopted under responsible government and, without asking for assurances, accept office, formulate their practical proposals of reform, pass them into law and advise the Governor that they will find themselves endowed with both power and responsibility for the Government of their Provinces, I am sure Mr. Gandhi will find by following this step that he will have taken a tremendous step towards that transference of power from the bureaucracy to the largest and fullest democracy known in the world which he hopes to bring about.

('71', 419, 6, 8, 840176) August 22, 1936
('71', 419, 7, 9, 840192) For more than fifty years the Indian National Congress has laboured for the freedom of India, and ever, as its strength grew and it came to represent more and more the nationalist urge of the Indian people and their desire to put an end to exploitation by British Imperialism, it came into conflict with the ruling power.
('71', 419, 7, 10, 840514) During the recent years the Congress has led great movements for national freedom and has sought to develop sanctions whereby such freedom can be achieved by peaceful mass action and the disciplined sacrifice and suffering of the Indian people.
('71', 419, 7, 11, 840759) To the lead of the Congress the Indian people have responded in an abundant measure and thus confirmed their inherent right to freedom.
('71', 419, 7, 12, 840895) That struggle for freedom still continues and must continue till India is free and independent.
('71', 419, 7, 13, 840991) These years have seen the development of an economic crisis in India and the world which has led to a progressive deterioration in the condition of all classes of our people.
('71', 419, 7, 14, 841166) The poverty stricken masses are today in the grip of an even more abject poverty and destitution, and this growing disease urgently and insistently demands a radical remedy.
('71', 419, 7, 15, 841340) Poverty and unemployment have long been the lot of our peasantry and industrial workers; today they cover and crush other classes alsothe artisan, the trader, the small merchant, the middle class intelligentsia.
('71', 419, 7, 16, 841552) For the vast millions of our countrymen the problem of achieving national independence has become an

('71', 420, 1, 2, 841802) urgent one, for only independence can give us the power to solve our economic and social problems and end the exploitation of our masses.
('71', 420, 1, 3, 841940) The growth of the national movement and the economic crisis have resulted in the intense repression of the Indian people and the suppression of civil liberties, and the British Government has sought to strengthen the imperialist bonds that envelop India and to prepetuate the domination and exploitation of the Indian people by enacting the Government of India Act of 1935. .
('71', 420, 1, 4, 842316) In the international sphere crisis follows crisis in an ever deepening degree and world war hangs over the horizon.
('71', 420, 1, 5, 842432) The Lucknow Congress called the attention of the nation to this grave situation in India and the world, and declared its opposition to the participation of India in an imperialist war and its firm resolve to continue the struggle for the independence of India.
('71', 420, 1, 6, 842693) The Congress rejected in its entirety the Constitution imposed upon India by the new Act and declared that no constitution imposed by outside authority and no constitution which curtails the sovereignty of the people of India, and does not recognize their right to shape and control fully their political and economic future, can be accepted.
('71', 420, 1, 7, 843036) Such a constitution, in its opinion, must be based on the independence of India as a nation and it can only be framed by a Constituent Assembly.
('71', 420, 1, 8, 843181) The Congress has always laid stress on the development of the strength of the people and the forging of sanctions to enforce the peoples will.
('71', 420, 1, 9, 843324) To this end it has carried on activities outside the Legislatures.
('71', 420, 1, 10, 843391) The Congress holds that real strength comes from thus organizing and serving the masses.
('71', 420, 1, 11, 843480) Adhering to this policy and objective, but in view of the present situation and in order to prevent the operation of forces calculated to strengthen alien domination and exploitation, the Congress decides to contest seats in the coming elections for the provincial Legislatures.
('71', 420, 1, 12, 843759) But the purpose of sending Congressmen to the Legislatures under the new Act is not to co operate in any way with the Act but to combat it and seek to end it.
('71', 420, 1, 13, 843918) It is to carry out, in so far as is possible, the Congress policy of rejection of the Act, and to resist British imperialism in its attempts to strengthen its hold on India and its exploitation of the Indian people.
('71', 420, 1, 14, 844134) In the opinion of the Congress, activity in the Legislatures should be such as to help in the work outside, in the strengthening of the people, and in the development of the sanctions which are essential to freedom.
('71', 420, 1, 15, 844350) The new Legislatures, hedged and circumscribed by safeguards and special powers for the protection of British and other vested interests, cannot yield substantial benefits, and they are totally incapable of solving the vital problems of poverty and unemployment.
('71', 420, 1, 16, 844613) But they may well be used by British imperialism for its own purposes to the disadvantage and injury of the Indian people.
('71', 420, 1, 17, 844736) The Congress representatives will seek to resist this, and to take all possible steps to end the various regulations, Ordinances and Acts which oppress the Indian people and smother their will to freedom.
('71', 420, 1, 18, 844941) They will work for the establishment of civil liberty, for the release of political prisoners and detenus, and to repair the wrongs done to the peasantry and to public institutions in the course of national struggle.
('71', 420, 2, 19, 845158) The Congress realizes that independence cannot be achieved through these Legislatures, nor can the problem of poverty and unemployment be effectively

('71', 421, 1, 2, 845350) tackled by them.
('71', 421, 1, 3, 845367) Nevertheless the Congress places its general programme before the people of India so that they may know what it stands for and what it will try to achieve, whenever it has the power to do so .
('71', 421, 2, 4, 845560) Pending the formulation of a fuller programme, the Congress reiterates its declaration made at Karachithat it stands for a reform of the system of land tenure and rent and an equitable adjustment of the burden on agricultural land, giving immediate relief to the smaller peasantry by a substantial reduction of agricultural rent and revenue now paid by them and exempting uneconomic holdings from payment of rent and revenue.
('71', 421, 3, 5, 845986) The communal decision, which forms part of the new Act, has led to much controversy and the Congress attitude towards it has been misunderstood by some people.
('71', 421, 3, 6, 846146) The rejection in its entirety of the new Act by the Congress inevitably involves the rejection of the communal decision.
('71', 421, 3, 7, 846267) Even apart from the Act as a whole the communal decision is wholly unacceptable as being inconsistent with independence and the principle of democracy.
('71', 421, 3, 8, 846419) The Congress therefore, holds that the right way to deal with the situation created by the communal decision is to intensify our struggle for independence and, at the same time, to seek a common basis for an agreed solution which helps to strengthen the unity of India.
('71', 421, 4, 9, 846689) The question of accepting Ministers or not in the new Legislatures was postponed for a decision by the Lucknow Congress.
('71', 421, 4, 10, 846810) The A.I.C.C. is of opinion that it will be desirable for this decision to be taken after the elections.
('71', 421, 4, 11, 846914) What ever the decision on this question might be, it must be remembered that, in any event, the Congress stands for the rejection of the new Act, and for no co operation in its working.
('71', 421, 4, 12, 847100) The object remains the samethe ending of the Act.
('71', 421, 4, 13, 847150) With a view to this end every endeavour will be made to prevent the introduction and functioning of the federal part of the scheme, which is intended to perpetuate the domination of imperialist interests and the feudal interests of the States over the whole country and prevent all progress towards freedom.
('71', 421, 4, 14, 847458) It must be borne in mind that the new provincial Assemblies will form the electorate for the proposed federal central Legislature and the composition of those provincial Legislatures will materially affect the fate of the federal Constitution.
('71', 421, 5, 15, 847702) With this great and inspiring goal before us, for which so many men and women of India have suffered and sacrificed their all under the banner of the Congress, and for which today thousands of our countrymen are suffering silently and with brave endurance, we call upon our people with full hope and confidence to rally to the cause of the Congress, of India, of freedom.

('71', 422, 2, 3, 848184) LORD ZETLANDS SPEECH 1
('71', 422, 3, 4, 848207) May 6, 1937
('71', 422, 4, 5, 848219) If a quasi legal formula could be devised to regulate the varied and changing relationships between the Governor and his Ministry, it would have been embodied in the Act.
('71', 422, 4, 6, 848390) It was just because there was no such formula that it was emphasized again and again in the course of the discussions preceding the Bill that it would be the spirit in which the Constitution was worked that would be of the first importance for its success.
('71', 422, 4, 7, 848647) It is here that such unfortunate misunderstandings have arisen.
('71', 422, 4, 8, 848711) In some quarters a great deal more has been read into that part of the Act which imposes certain obligations upon a Governor that it actually contains.
('71', 422, 5, 9, 848863) In its most recent pronouncement, the Congress declared that the past record and the present attitude of the British Government showed that without the assurances demanded a popular Ministry would be exposed to constant irritating interference.
('71', 422, 5, 10, 849108) This differs so profoundly from the picture of a popular Ministry functioning under the Act as I have always seen it that it is perhaps desirable that I should describe the working of the Constitution in Indian Provinces as I always contemplated it.
('71', 422, 5, 11, 849358) Since I was a member not only of the Select Committee, but the Round Table Conference, I may claim to know something of the intentions of those who framed the measure and the spirit in which it was conceived.
('71', 422, 6, 12, 849567) First let it not be supposed that the field of Government may be divided into two parts in which the Governor and Ministry operate separately at the risk of clashes between them.
('71', 422, 6, 13, 849746) The essence of the new Constitution is that the initiative and responsibility for the whole Government of the Province, though in form vested in the Governor, passes to the Ministry as soon as it takes office.
('71', 422, 6, 14, 849956) It will be the Governors duty to help Ministers in their task in every way, particularly by his political experience or administrative knowledge.
('71', 422, 7, 15, 850102) The reserved powers of which so much has been made by the Congress will not normally be in operation; indeed they only come into the picture if he considers that the carefully limited special responsibilities laid upon him by the Act and impressed upon him by the Instrument of Instructions are involved, but even if the question of their use does arisehere is emphasized the spirit in which it was intended that the Constitution should be workedit would be altogether wrong to assume that a Governor would immediately set himself in open opposition to his Ministry.

('71', 423, 1, 2, 850958) That is the last thing in the world that I should either expect or desire.
('71', 423, 1, 3, 851033) A Governor whose advice and support has been valuable to a Ministry in the conduct of its own affairs will surely be able to lay his own difficulties before them the moment he sees a risk that he and his Ministers may not see eye to eye in a matter for which special responsibility has been laid upon him by parliament.
('71', 423, 1, 4, 851353) Just as Ministers can count upon the assistance of the Governor in their difficulties, so could he in his turn rely upon receiving the sympathetic consideration of his Ministers for a difficulty in his own position which, maybe, could be met by some modification of their proposals that would not materially affect the Ministrys programme.
('71', 423, 2, 5, 851693) In any case a discussion of the matter between men working together for a
('71', 423, 3, 6, 851767) common purpose is likely at least to secure that points of difference between them are
('71', 423, 4, 7, 851854) narrowed.
('71', 423, 4, 8, 851864) It will then be for each having regard to the interests of the Province as a
('71', 423, 5, 9, 851941) whole to consider whether the points of difference so narrowed and defined justify a
('71', 423, 6, 10, 852026) break in a fruitful relationship.
('71', 423, 6, 11, 852060) It would doubtless be too much to hope that occasions
('71', 423, 7, 12, 852114) will never arise in which neither side can with good conscience give way.
('71', 423, 7, 13, 852188) But if my
('71', 423, 8, 14, 852198) picture of the working of Government under the Act is true and if the relations
('71', 423, 9, 15, 852278) between the Governor and his Ministry are those of partners in a common enterprise,
('71', 423, 10, 16, 852362) there can be no possible question of the Governors interfering constantly and
('71', 423, 11, 17, 852440) embarrassingly in the responsibilities and work of the Ministries.
('71', 423, 12, 18, 852507) It is certainly not the intention that Govenors by a narrow or legalistic
('71', 423, 13, 19, 852581) interpretation of their own responsibilities should trench upon the wide power which
('71', 423, 14, 20, 852666) it was the purpose of parliament to place in the hands of Ministries and which it is our
('71', 423, 15, 21, 852755) desire they should use in the furtherance of the programmes which they advocated.
('71', 423, 16, 22, 852837) the working of the Constitution as far as it at present is possible to judge, I find
('71', 423, 17, 23, 852922) happy confirmation of the picture as I have always seen it.
('71', 423, 18, 24, 852982) Both in the Provinces in which Ministries are working with majorities in the
('71', 423, 19, 25, 853059) Legislatures and those in which minority Ministries are functioning, a bold
('71', 423, 20, 26, 853135) programme has been drawn up as far as I know without the smallest attempt on the
('71', 423, 21, 27, 853216) part of any Governor to interfere.
('71', 423, 22, 28, 853251) Is it too much to hope that those who have so far hesitated to accept
('71', 423, 23, 29, 853321) responsibilities of office from a mistaken sense of fear lest they should be unduly
('71', 423, 24, 30, 853405) hampered in their tasks will derive reassurance and encouragement from the object 
('71', 423, 25, 31, 853488) lesson provided by the actual working of the Constitution in their midst?
('71', 423, 26, 32, 853562) hardly say that I hope devoutly and in all sincerity that it may be so.

('71', 424, 2, 3, 853720) KOODALMANIKKAM TEMPLE CONTROVERSY 1
('71', 424, 3, 4, 853756) At Irinjalakuda in the Cochin State there is an ancient and important Hindu temple known as the Koodalmanikkam Devaswom.
('71', 424, 3, 5, 853877) The Devaswom owns extensive lands in Travancore, Cochin and Malabar.
('71', 424, 3, 6, 853946) The management of the affairs of the Temple, both spiritual and temporal, is vested in a person who is designated the Thachudaya Kaimal which literally means the Chief of Lord, who owns the building (Temple).
('71', 424, 3, 7, 854155) This person is appointed by His Highness the Maharaja of Travancore in exercise of His Highnesss immemorial right recognized and confirmed by the treaties between Travancore and Cochin in 1761, 1765 and 1805. The nomination and consecration of the Kaimal are no mere secular acts but are attended with elaborate ceremonies which have deep religious significance and are relevant in indicating the status of the Kaimal in relation to the Temple.
('71', 424, 3, 8, 854600) By virtue of the nomination and consecration ceremonies, the nominee, who was originally a Nair by birth, becomes clothed with the spiritual dignity and status of the highest Brahmin, and his spiritual eminence is considered superior even to that of His Highness the Maharaja of Cochin.
('71', 424, 3, 9, 854887) For according to tradition even his Highness the Maharaja of Cochin has to touch the pole of the Kaimals palanquin just when the Kaimal enters it to be taken in procession round the Temple.
('71', 424, 3, 10, 855077) He assumes the name of the deity and is called Manikkam Keralan and manages the spiritual and temporal affairs of the Devaswom.
('71', 424, 3, 11, 855205) When he dies purificatory ceremonies are performed in the Temple and Brahmins perform the cremation ceremony; and sraddham for the dead Kaimal is performed in the Temple.
('71', 424, 3, 12, 855376) The idea is that with the consecration the Kaimal becomes the visible representative of the presiding deity.
('71', 424, 4, 13, 855485) With the death of a former Kaimal in 1850, disputes arose as to the right of the Maharaja of Travancore to appoint the successor.
('71', 424, 4, 14, 855615) The contention was put forward by Cochin that the Kaimal had no right of management of the Temple and that the right to nominate the Kaimal could be exercised by Travancore only when the Temple building itself stood in need of repair.
('71', 424, 4, 15, 855850) Travancore repudiated this plea and asserted the right of the Maharaja of Travancore to appoint a Kaimal to be in management of the spiritual and temporal affairs of the Temple whenever that office fell vacant.
('71', 424, 4, 16, 856061) The matter was referred to arbitration; and after protracted enquiry, the Abritrator Mr. J.C. Hannyngton decided that Cochins contentions were untenable, that the Travancore nominee had entire management and control of the whole of the Temple concerns and its endowments.
('71', 424, 4, 17, 856333) The Kaimal was then appointed and duly consecrated, but Cochin again contested before its own local courts the right of the Kaimal to institute suits on behalf of the Devaswom or to collect the rents and profits independently of the Yogakkars, who, it was alleged, were still the owners of the Temple.
('71', 424, 4, 18, 856635) Travancore contended that the Kaimal was the supreme spiritual and temporal authority of the Koodalmanikkam Temple and had the sole right of

('71', 425, 0, 1, 856839) 426 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('71', 425, 1, 2, 856881) management of all affairs concerning the Temple and that the status and powers of the Kaimal did not depend on the pronouncement of the Municipal Courts of Cochin.
('71', 425, 1, 3, 857045) The Madras Government accepted the contentions of the Travancore Government.
('71', 425, 1, 4, 857122) The Resident was directed to advise the Cochin Durbar to restore to the Kaimal by legislation or proclamation the powers of which he had been found to have been deprived by the judicial decisions in Cochin.
('71', 425, 1, 5, 857329) The Cochin Durbar took the matter in appeal before the Secretary of State who confirmed the decision of the Madras Government.
('71', 425, 1, 6, 857456) Meanwhile, the Kaimal who was then in office died and another Kaimal had to be appointed.
('71', 425, 1, 7, 857546) The States could not agree as to the best method of providing such control and eventually, after long pending negotiations, it was agreed that the British Resident might be constituted as the Controlling Authority with reference specially to the management of the properities and incomes belonging to the Devaswom.
('71', 425, 1, 8, 857861) A scheme of management was accordingly drawn up and agreed to by all the parties concerned in which the spiritual authority of the Kaimal as the chief religious authority to clear all doubts in connection with the internal management of the temple was expressly affirmed and provision was made whereby (a) the Kaimal was not to exceed a certain scale of personal expenditure prescribed for him, (b) the Kaimal had to keep correct accounts of all receipts and expenditure and submit financial statements, as audited, to the Governments of Travancore and Cochin and to the Controlling Authority, (c) the Kaimal was subject to be removed by the Controlling Authority, from the management of the Devaswom properties and incomes if, on enquiry in the manner prescribed in the scheme, the Kaimal was found guilty of mismanagement and misconduct which rendered his further continuance in control of the Temple undesirable.
('71', 425, 1, 9, 858777) The only right of the Yogakkars recognized in the scheme was that the annual accounts should be read out from the Temple to the Yogakkars on a prescribed day of every year.
('71', 425, 2, 10, 858950) This, in brief, is the present position of the Kaimal; and the Kaimal now in office functions under the provisions of the scheme outlined above.
('71', 425, 2, 11, 859095) It will thus be clear that after a dispute which lasted for over seventy years the status and functions of the Kaimal, both spiritual and temporal, were finally settled when the proclamation and scheme of management were promulgated in 1917. Everything was calm and smooth until some time after the Travancore Temple entry Proclamation.
('71', 425, 2, 12, 859432) There was no question that the Kaimal was not the supreme spiritual authority to regulate and settle all matters of a religious nature.
('71', 425, 2, 13, 859568) But when tantris who had officiated in Travancore temples entered and officiated in the Koodalmanikkam Temple, Cochin revived the contention as to the Yogakkars right to control the Kaimals action in regard to religious practices and to issue directions to him.
('71', 425, 2, 14, 859830) On representations made by some of them, His Highness the Maharaja of Cochin declared on the 15th April that the Temple was polluted because a tantri who officiated in a Travancore temple which was open to avarnas had officiated in the Koodalmanikkam Temple, and that purificatory ceremony in the Temple was necessary before the utsavam festival could commence.
('71', 425, 2, 15, 860192) The vazhivadoos or offerings of the Cochin Maharaja were also ordered to be withdrawn until further orders.
('71', 425, 2, 16, 860300) On the 17th April, the Resident issued directions to the Kaimal asking the latter to follow the instructions
('71', 426, 0, 1, 860409) VOL. 71: 25 FEBRUARY, 1937 5 JULY, 1937 427
('71', 426, 1, 2, 860453) issued by the Maharaja of Cochin.
('71', 426, 1, 3, 860487) The Kaimal obeyed the directions of the Resident.
('71', 426, 1, 4, 860537) Encouraged obviously by the action of the Resident, the Cochin Government again issued orders to the Kaimal to prohibit the entry into the Temple or the tank of all persons who had participated in ceremonies in Travancore temples, unless they performed prayaschittam.
('71', 426, 1, 5, 860805) The Kaimal protested against the action of the Cochin Maharaja and complained about the scope of the Residents orders.
('71', 426, 1, 6, 860924) Travancore had no concern with the action taken by the Cochin Government with respect to the subjects of the Cochin State and was merely interested in preserving the authority which the Kaimal assumed when he was invested with that office on nomination by His Highness the Maharaja of Travancore.
('71', 426, 1, 7, 861221) According to Travancore, the only authority competent to declare whether under the circumstances there was pollution or not and whether purificatory ceremony was required or not was the Kaimal as the spiritual head of the Devaswoma position affirmed even in the scheme promulgated by the Cochin Maharaja with the consent of Travancore and the British Government.
('71', 426, 1, 8, 861584) Any order passed by the Maharaja of Cochin or the Resident without reference to the Kaimal and opposed to his (Kaimals) own declaration would be ineffective and without jurisdiction.
('71', 426, 1, 9, 861767) The Resident has subsequently made his position clear as is evident from the interviews given by him to the Press.
('71', 426, 1, 10, 861882) The direction given by him to the Kaimal did not purport to be an interference with the exercise of the discretion vested in the Kaimal in religious matters but were intended to maintain status quo mainly as aprecautionary measure to preserve law and order.
('71', 426, 1, 11, 862140) According to Travancore, the powers of the Resident as Controlling Authority are limited to those expressly specified in the Scheme and no proper occasion had arisen for the intervention of the Resident either as Controlling Authority or as representative of the Paramount Power, for, in either capacity, the Resident had no jurisdiction in giving directions on religious matters solely within the cognizance of the Kaimal.
('71', 426, 1, 12, 862564) If there was any apprehension of breaches of the peace, there is nothing to show that the Cochin Government could not have dealt with the situation adequately.
('71', 426, 1, 13, 862724) The Kaimal himself has stated in an interview that even without the Residents intervention the Utsavam festival would have passed off peacefully, and that this would have been possible even though some of the sanatanist tantris had non co operated.
('71', 426, 1, 14, 862973) The Kaimal has subsequently exercised his discretion and declared that in the circumstances stated there was no pollution whatever.
('71', 426, 1, 15, 863105) Travancore contends that this declaration finally settles the controversy and that the Resident having substantially upheld the discretionary authority of the Kaimal in spiritual matters Travancore has no more any reason to complain.
('71', 426, 1, 16, 863339) It may be of interest to note that even in the not distant past there have been instances when ancient religious customs and usages have been departed from in Cochin on the ground that they were unreasonable.
('71', 426, 1, 17, 863548) Men who had cropped their hair and men who had crossed the sea had no admission into temples in Cochin.
('71', 426, 1, 18, 863652) But the prohibition does not now exist.
('71', 426, 1, 19, 863692) The ground on which, in the present case, the Maharaja of Cochin declared in favour of pollution, is not sanctioned by the Shastras or by usage.
