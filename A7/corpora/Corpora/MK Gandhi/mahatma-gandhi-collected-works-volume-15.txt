('15', 0, 2, 3, 72) AHMEDABAD, May 21 [1915]
('15', 0, 3, 4, 97) MY DEAR FRIEND, Here am I now hoping to settle down.
('15', 0, 3, 5, 150) The boys are at the Gurukul, Hardwar, I have wired for them and they may be here any day.
('15', 0, 3, 6, 240) Two cottages have been placed at my disposal.
('15', 0, 3, 7, 286) They are isolated from this big city.
('15', 0, 3, 8, 324) There are 3 acres of ground attached to them.
('15', 0, 3, 9, 370) Living there I shall conduct the Institution 1 along our lines and shall search for an agricultural plot.
('15', 0, 3, 10, 476) I pleaded for admission to the Society after Mr. Gokhales death as I knew that such was his wish.
('15', 0, 3, 11, 574) 2 Of course, my admission could not mean any alteration of my views.
('15', 0, 3, 12, 643) They are too firmly fixed to be altered.
('15', 0, 3, 13, 684) I find here nothing but confirmation.
('15', 0, 3, 14, 722) I am passing through a curious phase.
('15', 0, 3, 15, 760) I see around me on the surface nothing but hypocrisy, humbug and degradation and yet underneath it I trace a divinity I missed there as elsewhere.
('15', 0, 3, 16, 907) This is my India.
('15', 0, 3, 17, 925) It may be my blind love or ignorance or a picture of my own imagination.
('15', 0, 3, 18, 998) Anyway it gives me peace and happiness.
('15', 0, 3, 19, 1038) It fills me with hope and confidence without which no man could work.
('15', 0, 3, 20, 1108) I wonder if you will stick to your carpentry and restaurant keeping.
('15', 0, 3, 21, 1177) Both are good education.
('15', 0, 3, 22, 1202) Your diary does not even give me an idea of your monthly expenses.
('15', 0, 3, 23, 1269) Does Polak continue to give you satisfaction by way of letters?
('15', 0, 3, 24, 1333) Do you do any reading at all?
('15', 0, 3, 25, 1363) Have the rosary and Imitation of Christ disappeared from your view entirely?
('15', 0, 3, 26, 1440) With love,

('15', 1, 3, 4, 1799) UMIYASHANKER, I have your letter.
('15', 1, 3, 5, 1833) I returned only yesterday, after visiting Rajkot and Limbdi.
('15', 1, 3, 6, 1894) I have no personal relation with Hussain Tyobji so that I could write to him.
('15', 1, 3, 7, 1972) However, Chhabildas should apply immediately, or you may do so on his behalf.
('15', 1, 3, 8, 2050) may mention my name and say that I know him well and will be ready to give a guarantee [on his behalf].
('15', 1, 3, 9, 2154) If he then inquires of me, I shall be able to say something.
('15', 1, 3, 10, 2215) Have you done anything about what you were to send me concerning Chhotu?

('15', 1, 9, 16, 2446) BHAISHRI KUNVARJI, I do not see the least possibility of my being able to attend the conference this time.
('15', 1, 9, 17, 2553) I feel there is need for me to stay here at present.
('15', 1, 9, 18, 2606) I find I have been away from the students too long and should not therefore leave at once.
('15', 1, 9, 19, 2697) I must therefore look for another occasion to visit Surat.

('15', 2, 3, 4, 2991) DEAR MR. NATESAN, I have your letter enclosing cheque for Rs. 3,000 for which please find receipt herewith.
('15', 2, 3, 5, 3099) I notice that the Bangalore talk has been much misrepresented and that Mrs. Besant has done me no justice whatsoever.
('15', 2, 3, 6, 3217) I saw the talk only the day before yesterday and it is a parody of what I actually said.
('15', 2, 3, 7, 3306) I never sent Mrs. Besant any explanation for publication I now hear that she has published what purports to be an explanation from me.
('15', 2, 3, 8, 3441) Could you please send me the copies if you have seen them.
('15', 2, 4, 9, 3500) Yours sincerely,

('15', 2, 9, 19, 4020) Servants of India Society may not admit you as you are only a matriculate.

('15', 3, 3, 4, 4317) DEAR SIR, Mr. Natesan 1 has sent me your letters addressed to him and to me.
('15', 3, 3, 5, 4394) I thank you for both.
('15', 3, 3, 6, 4416) Your son 2 has been in correspondence with me.
('15', 3, 3, 7, 4463) His last letter stated that he was driven away by you.
('15', 3, 3, 8, 4518) I therefore wrote to him yesterday saying that in that case he was free to come to me.
('15', 3, 3, 9, 4605) His ultimate aim seems to be to join the Servants of India Society.
('15', 3, 3, 10, 4673) If your boy comes here and is found to be not of mature age so far as I am concerned he will be certainly sent back to you.
('15', 3, 3, 11, 4797) I take no boysunder age without the consent of their parents.
('15', 3, 3, 12, 4859) You may therefore fully depend upon my co operation with you.

('15', 3, 9, 18, 5165) MY DEAR FRIEND,
('15', 3, 10, 19, 5181) I feel like crying out to you Do come and help me! Mrs, Gandhi is again down with her swellings.
('15', 3, 10, 20, 5278) She has lost all power of resistance.
('15', 3, 10, 21, 5316) She weeps like a child, is ever angry with me as if I was the party responsible for her swellings.
('15', 3, 10, 22, 5415) I am over head and ears in work.
('15', 3, 10, 23, 5448) This institution costs me much trouble.

('15', 4, 1, 3, 5659) I am not dejected but I feel lonely.
('15', 4, 1, 4, 5696) You know what I mean.
('15', 4, 1, 5, 5718) Heaven knows what will happen.
('15', 4, 1, 6, 5749) There are so many sick people on the Farm.
('15', 4, 1, 7, 5792) I want hours of solitude and have not a minute of it.
('15', 4, 1, 8, 5846) Do buck up and prepare for the struggle of the spirit when you are able to come here.
('15', 4, 1, 9, 5932) I know nothing about some honour 1 that has been conferred upon me.
('15', 4, 1, 10, 6000) I have just received a letter of congratulations.

('15', 4, 6, 18, 6238) MAGANLAL, I have your letter.
('15', 4, 6, 19, 6268) I see that you are rather upset.
('15', 4, 6, 20, 6301) The fault, I am sure, is mine.
('15', 4, 6, 21, 6332) In attempting to ride too many horses at a time, I am in danger of falling off all of them.
('15', 4, 6, 22, 6424) I have not quite, for my enthusiasm proceeds from an eager desire for service.
('15', 4, 6, 23, 6503) I may not, however, be able to hold on long if I continue to go the way I am doing, forgetting all about service.
('15', 4, 6, 24, 6617) Be patient.
('15', 4, 6, 25, 6629) I intend to send you all, on suitable occasions, to different places, so that you may see things for yourselves.
('15', 4, 6, 26, 6742) Everything will depend on what help we get and how many we can have with us here.
('15', 4, 6, 27, 6824) I am perfectly confident of this, at any rate, that I shall satisfy the aspirations of you all; meanwhile, I do feel that the life you have all led so far has not been in vain, that, on the contrary, you have learnt much.
('15', 4, 6, 28, 7046) I am not unaware that you have not attained to a state of perfect non attachment, for I have not attained it myself and I know that you are yet to reach even my level.
('15', 4, 6, 29, 7214) If we stop making noise about the vows, we shall not find ourselves in unhappy situations as we occasionally do.
('15', 4, 6, 30, 7327) And now one question.
('15', 4, 6, 31, 7349) Explain to me what you mean by not having attained to a state of perfect non attachment.
('15', 4, 6, 32, 7438) I can explain [how that is so with me].
('15', 4, 6, 33, 7478) For example, I observe brahmacharya, but not in all its subtle aspects.
('15', 4, 6, 34, 7550) I cannot say that my

('15', 5, 1, 3, 7702) 2. I maintain truthfulness, but I cannot say that I am never guilty of exaggeration, consciously or unconsciously.
('15', 5, 1, 4, 7817) To say what I like saying and not to say anything which I do like saying casts a shadow on the vow of truthfulness.
('15', 5, 1, 5, 7933) 3. I make untiring efforts to control the palate but I observe that I extract the utmost pleasure from the five articles [I permit myself in a day].
('15', 5, 1, 6, 8082) But I do want to keep these and other vows inviolate and make progress in them day by day, and I am quite confident that 1 shall succeed.
('15', 5, 1, 7, 8220) I feel that I am not likely now to depart from a literal observance.

('15', 5, 5, 11, 8451) RESPECTED SHRI RANCHHODBHAI,
('15', 5, 6, 12, 8480) Having been very busy with various affairs, I could not write earlier.
('15', 5, 6, 13, 8551) Those at Hardwar were expected to arrive any day and so I could not go to Gondal nor could I stay on [at Rajkot].
('15', 5, 6, 14, 8665) I have taken up residence in two bungalows here.
('15', 5, 6, 15, 8714) Efforts [for acquiring land] will now be taken up.
('15', 5, 6, 16, 8765) Boarding expenses have to be found by me.

('15', 5, 6, 19, 8863) Things have not made as much progress as we would have liked, for the various articles take a long time in arriving.
('15', 5, 6, 20, 8980) Could you send from there someone to teach [us] how to operate an indigenous loom?
('15', 5, 6, 21, 9063) Could you secure me such a loom and some sample of handloom cloth woven on it?
('15', 5, 6, 22, 9142) Do you know any teacher, a man of character, who can teach Sanskrit and Gujarati?
('15', 5, 6, 23, 9224) We may pay him.
('15', 5, 6, 24, 9240) We shall be satisfied if we get one for a short period.

('15', 8, 3, 4, 12725) RESPECTED SHRI RANCHHODBHAI,
('15', 8, 4, 5, 12754) I have your letter.
('15', 8, 4, 6, 12774) Thanks for your criticism.
('15', 8, 4, 7, 12801) The portion concerning parents is written with the best intentions but I shall make changes in it all the same.
('15', 8, 4, 8, 12913) As for the other points, instead of carrying on a discussion in letters, I hope to have a full talk about them when we meet.
('15', 8, 4, 9, 13038) I will sacrifice this life itself to uphold the sanatana dharma as I understand it.
('15', 8, 5, 10, 13122) I want coarse cloth as well as fine hand woven cloth.
('15', 8, 5, 11, 13176) I shall be glad, therefore, if you send it from there as well as from Palanpur.
('15', 8, 5, 12, 13256) Please send the loom and the man who will teach how to operate it, as soon as they can possibly arrive.
('15', 8, 6, 13, 13360) Respectful greetings from

('15', 8, 11, 19, 13577) I send herewith a copy of the scheme [of the Ashram].
('15', 8, 11, 20, 13631) Return it after you have gone through it You may also send any comments you feel like making.
('15', 8, 11, 21, 13725) If, moreover, there are any men of learning in Bhavnagar to whom copies should be sent, give me their names.

('15', 9, 6, 7, 14381) AHMEDABAD, Vaishakh Vad 13 [June 10, 1915] 1
('15', 9, 7, 8, 14426) RESPECTED SHRI RANCHHODBHAI, I wrote to you yesterday in the midst of many preoccupations.
('15', 9, 7, 9, 14517) I think some of your questions I should answer right now.
('15', 9, 7, 10, 14575) I have a little time on hand today and, since I leave for Poona in the evening, I set down a few things this very moment.
('15', 9, 7, 11, 14697) There need be no congratulations on [the award of] the Kaiseri Hind medal.
('15', 9, 7, 12, 14772) 2 One may get it and also lose it.
('15', 9, 7, 13, 14807) I do want a medal, but of a different kind altogether.
('15', 9, 7, 14, 14862) There is no knowing when I shall get it, if ever.
('15', 9, 7, 15, 14912) The English article which is sold as flour is often no flour but a mixture of other things.
('15', 9, 7, 16, 15004) There is fraud in [the sale of] this article.
('15', 9, 7, 17, 15050) The retailer, being a third party, may not perhaps be involved in it.
('15', 9, 7, 18, 15120) Handloom cloth is only an example.
('15', 9, 7, 19, 15155) The vow of swadeshi implies that every article should be swadeshi.
('15', 9, 7, 20, 15222) Kindly permit me to say that the observance of this vow has a subtle moral bearing.
('15', 9, 7, 21, 15306) Arithmetic will certainly include oral sums and Indian accountancy.
('15', 9, 7, 22, 15374) It cannot be that Gujaratis will never look outside Gujarat.
('15', 9, 7, 23, 15435) They will go everywhere in India.
('15', 9, 7, 24, 15469) They are to serve the nation.
('15', 9, 7, 25, 15499) If they do not know the languages of Madras, they can have no contact with the people there.
('15', 9, 7, 26, 15592) As for English, it can be of service only to those who know English.
('15', 9, 7, 27, 15661) Shankar 3 had learnt all the languages of India.
('15', 9, 7, 28, 15710) Vallabh 4, who belonged to the land of the Dravids, had learnt Gujarati.
('15', 9, 8, 29, 15783) 1 This was written on the next day after Letter to Ranchhodlal Patwari, 9 6 1915. 2 Gandhiji was awarded this medal on June 26 at Poona.

('15', 10, 0, 1, 15973) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 11
('15', 10, 1, 2, 16014) There are at present hundreds of Gujaratis in Madras who know Tamil.
('15', 10, 1, 3, 16083) [In] Europe, people in the various countries know four or five European languages.
('15', 10, 1, 4, 16166) It is very easy to acquire such proficiency in languages.
('15', 10, 1, 5, 16224) The time wasted over English will, if saved, be sufficient for the purpose of these other languages.
('15', 10, 1, 6, 16325) Pupils are to receive education which will incline them to do nothing but national service when their studies are over.
('15', 10, 1, 7, 16445) If, on growing up, they leave the Ashram, the education will have failed to that extent.
('15', 10, 1, 8, 16534) Should any occasion of the kind arise, the student will be free [to follow his inclination].
('15', 10, 1, 9, 16627) It is not the aim, however, that the students should return to their parents and get lost in the sea of practical affairs.
('15', 10, 1, 10, 16750) I have had bitter experience that, when provision is made for exceptional circumstances, parents conveniently fall ill.
('15', 10, 1, 11, 16870) While they are still in the stage of brahmacharya, students must not go to attend marriages.
('15', 10, 1, 12, 16963) They are to be surrounded with a new kind of atmosphere and I always feel that, if there is frequent breaking away from this, building of character is impossible.
('15', 10, 1, 13, 17126) As for dress, a single uniform is prescribed for the present, it being necessary to do this for several reasons.
('15', 10, 1, 14, 17239) I think I have given very deep thought to the subject of milk.
('15', 10, 1, 15, 17302) It is a legacy of our non vegetarian past.
('15', 10, 1, 16, 17345) It is objectionable from so many points of view that it ought to be avoided altogether.
('15', 10, 1, 17, 17433) Quite a number of boys have gone through the experiment for several years and I have observed no ill effects on their health.
('15', 10, 1, 18, 17559) More [about this] when we meet.
('15', 10, 1, 19, 17591) I shall try to respect peoples sentiments in every way I can without compromising the aims of the Ashram.
('15', 10, 1, 20, 17697) We have secured four teachers.
('15', 10, 1, 21, 17728) One of them will stay with us.
('15', 10, 1, 22, 17759) Others live in the neighbourhood and come over daily for teaching.
('15', 10, 1, 23, 17826) If a teacher is not a man of character, he will be of no use to us.
('15', 10, 2, 24, 17894) Respectful greetings from
('15', 10, 3, 25, 17920) MOHANDAS For washing clothes, I use for the present an Indian soap which is free from fat.

('15', 11, 10, 15, 18665) MAHATMAJI, As I was preoccupied with making all sorts of arrangements after the boys arrival from Gurukul, I could not write to you earlier.
('15', 11, 10, 16, 18806) The boys can never forget the love you showered on them, I am highly obliged to you for giving shelter to my boys and colleagues.
('15', 11, 10, 17, 18936) I have started an Ashram at Ahmedabad at any rate for the time being.
('15', 11, 10, 18, 19006) A Hindi version of its rules and regulations is being prepared, When ready, it will be sent to you for your opinion.

('15', 12, 7, 9, 20134) MY DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('15', 12, 7, 10, 20170) The omission of your dairy altogether is, I feel, a retrogression.
('15', 12, 7, 11, 20237) It was a good measure of discipline.
('15', 12, 7, 12, 20274) Your diary gave me an insight into yourself for that particular week as nothing else could.
('15', 12, 7, 13, 20366) Do please therefore resume your diary if you can.
('15', 12, 7, 14, 20416) This has been a sad week.
('15', 12, 7, 15, 20442) Bombay has so weighed me down that I am in a most melancholy mood.
('15', 12, 7, 16, 20509) If I had to live in Bombay for one year, I would die.
('15', 12, 7, 17, 20563) I am glad just now you are not with me.
('15', 12, 7, 18, 20603) I go about barefoot.
('15', 12, 7, 19, 20624) There is hardly a road clean enough to make you feel safe about your tread.
('15', 12, 7, 20, 20700) This has not got on my nerves so much hitherto because I have not had the opportunity of walking much.
('15', 12, 7, 21, 20803) And the closets!
('15', 12, 7, 22, 20820) I know you would vomit eternally if you merely looked at them.
('15', 12, 7, 23, 20883) Now what is the duty of a reformer in this position?
('15', 12, 7, 24, 20936) Can the city life be mended?
('15', 12, 7, 25, 20965) If not, can he by working in a city perpetuate the life?
('15', 12, 7, 26, 21022) Suppose he succeeded in getting clean roads and clean closets, not by any means an easy task, what will he have gained?
('15', 12, 7, 27, 21142) How is he to deal with the filth within?
('15', 12, 7, 28, 21183) How will he regulate the morality of the people?
('15', 12, 7, 29, 21232) These are awful questions and I have to answer them, you have to answer them.
('15', 12, 7, 30, 21310) The enclosed is a partial or complete answer.

('15', 13, 5, 18, 22422) AHMEDABAD, June [16] 2, 1915
('15', 13, 6, 19, 22451) DEAR MR. PETIT,
('15', 13, 7, 20, 22467) I beg to submit herewith an account of the income and expenditure as up to the 31st January 1915 in connection with the passive resistance movement in South Africa.
('15', 13, 7, 21, 22632) Publication of the account has been delayed beyond my desire and expectation.
('15', 13, 7, 22, 22710) It was Mr. Gokhales intention that the accounts should be published along with a statement about the disposal of the balance in hand.
('15', 13, 7, 23, 22844) As he was the prime mover in India and remained in closest touch with the movement to the end, I never did anything without consultation with him, and through him with your Committee.
('15', 13, 7, 24, 23028) It was his intention that before the accounts were finally published, I should confer with your Committee.
('15', 13, 7, 25, 23135) The cruel hand of Death having removed him from us, the matter of publication has been further delayed, and it is only now that it has become possible to submit the accounts to the public.
('15', 13, 8, 26, 23324) 1 This was sent to the addressee, Jehangir Bomanji Petit, who was Secretary of the South African Indian Fund, as a draft.
('15', 13, 8, 27, 23446) It was eventually printed and made public on October 31, 1915, with additions and alterations indicated in footnotes.
('15', 13, 8, 28, 23564) 2 Vide Diary for 1915.
('15', 14, 0, 1, 23587) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 15
('15', 14, 1, 2, 23628) The income includes not only the monies received through you but includes also those received from Madras, Rangoon, London and various parts of Africa, Passive Resistance School, etc.
('15', 14, 1, 3, 23812) Thus, of the 27,324.0.7, 8,424.0.7 were monies other than those received through you.
('15', 14, 1, 4, 23898) As to expenditure, there are some items which require explanation.
('15', 14, 1, 5, 23965) Relief which takes up nearly 3,000/ means assistance given to Passive Resisters or their families, and it is a recurring item.
('15', 14, 1, 6, 24092) There are widows of Passive Resisters who died during the struggle without leaving anything for those left behind them.
('15', 14, 1, 7, 24212) There are children of Passive Resisters and Passive Resisters themselves who require support.
('15', 14, 1, 8, 24306) 1 Farm upkeep and improvements mean expenses in connection with the Phoenix Settlement which became the Passive Resistance Farm after the transference to Phoenix of Passive Resisters from Tolstoy Farm belonging to Mr. Kallenbach.
('15', 14, 1, 9, 24536) Phoenix Settlement consists of 100 acres of land originally bought by me for locating the printing works of Indian Opinion.
('15', 14, 1, 10, 24660) Though the legal title vested in me for some years, I never made personal use of the property.
('15', 14, 1, 11, 24755) During the struggle, however, I divested myself of the legal title and it is now held by Trustees for public purposes defined in a registered Trust deed.
('15', 14, 2, 12, 24909) This property is still being used for housing Passive Resisters or their families.
('15', 14, 2, 13, 24992) Settlers who are living on the land receive no wages but take out of the income from Indian Opinion, and other sources just enough for their maintenance.
('15', 14, 2, 14, 25146) The journal has never been and can never become an entirely self supporting proposition.
('15', 14, 2, 15, 25235) The English portion of it is mainly of an educative character for the European public amongst whom it is distributed gratis.
('15', 14, 2, 16, 25360) It was a powerful weapon in the armoury of Passive Resistance and continues to be the only recorder of accurately sifted facts about our countrymen in South Africa and of Passive Resistance movement.
('15', 14, 2, 17, 25560) It is in no sense a commercial enterprise.
('15', 14, 2, 18, 25603) This settlement will still need assistance.
('15', 14, 3, 19, 25647) The third item is Valiama Hall.
('15', 14, 3, 20, 25679) This is an institution founded in the memory of the late Valiama, a girl of 17 who died shortly after her discharge from prison of fever contracted therein.
('15', 14, 3, 21, 25836) Its use will be

('15', 14, 4, 23, 26008) 3 In the published letter, this sentence reads: It is to this settlement that assistance has been given to the extent mentioned in the account.
('15', 15, 0, 1, 26152) 16 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 15, 1, 2, 26193) chiefly educational.
('15', 15, 1, 3, 26214) The Tamil portion of our countrymen have suffered most.
('15', 15, 1, 4, 26270) Johannesburg is one of the largest Indian centres.
('15', 15, 1, 5, 26321) It gave the largest number of Passive Resisters, and the Tamils were the foremost among them.
('15', 15, 1, 6, 26415) The late sister belonged to Johannesburg.
('15', 15, 1, 7, 26457) No better use of the Passive Resistance funds could be conceived than to have a permanent hall in Johannesburg for the public needs of the community.
('15', 15, 1, 8, 26607) The institution will be registered in the name of Messrs Kachalia, the Chairman of the British Indian Association, Thambi Naidoo and Polak for the purposes mentioned above.
('15', 15, 1, 9, 26780) This will cost probably 4,000. I hope that this disposal of the funds will commend itself to your Committee as being strictly in accordance with the purposes for whichthe monies were sent to South Africa, namely, relief of Passive Resisters and furtherance of the struggle.
('15', 15, 1, 10, 27054) The available balance should, in my opinion, remain as it has done, in the names of Messrs A. H. West and Maganlal K. Gandhi as a trust with instructions to utilize the funds from time to time for furtherance of measures being adopted to secure just administration of local laws and the removal of the remaining disabilities and for relief of Passive Resisters, if further relief than what I have already adverted to is necessary.
('15', 15, 1, 11, 27485) Co operation of Messrs Cachalia, Parsee Rustomjee and other Passive Resisters is sought whenever extraordinary expenditure has to be incurred.
('15', 15, 2, 12, 27628) Whilst the actual courting of imprisonment has ceased, the struggle for removal of the remaining disabilities itself has by no means ceased and this brings me to a brief statement of its results.
('15', 15, 2, 13, 27824) 2 In its last stages, nearly 25,000 Indians actively participated in it, that is, one sixth of the total Indian population in South Africa.
('15', 15, 2, 14, 27964) The balance of the community practically but with few exceptions supported the struggle whether by contributions in cash or in kind or by holding meetings in support 3, etc.
('15', 15, 2, 15, 28138) It began in the Transvaal with the passing of
('15', 15, 3, 16, 28184) 1 In the published letter, this paragraph is replaced by the following: Bulk of the unexpended balance, viz., Rs. 215,000 has been cabled to me from Durban.
('15', 15, 3, 17, 28341) In accordance with the desire of your Committee, I have handed this sum to you.
('15', 15, 3, 18, 28421) In my opinion, the saving of such a large sum shows that utmost economy has been used in handling the funds.
('15', 15, 3, 19, 28530) It is perhaps necessary at this stage to give in its briefest outline an account of the struggle to the maintenance of which the mother country contributed so generously. 2 In the published letter, this sentence reads: Whilst the actual courting of imprisonment has ceased, the struggle itself has by no means ended. 3 These two words are omitted in the published letter.

('15', 16, 2, 3, 29269) (1) Repeal of the Asiatic Act.
('15', 16, 2, 4, 29300) (2) Removal of the racial or colour disqualification as to immigration from the Union legislation.
('15', 16, 2, 5, 29399) (3) Removal of the legal disabilities of Indian wives.
('15', 16, 2, 6, 29454) (4) Removal of the annual Poll Tax of 3, which was payable by ex indentured Indians, their wives and grown up children.
('15', 16, 2, 7, 29574) (5) Just administration of existing laws with due regard to vested rights.
('15', 16, 2, 8, 29649) All these points are covered by the settlement of the last year which are considered 2 to be a complete vindication of Passive Resistance and I venture to state that if more has not been gained, more was not and could not be asked 3 for as an item in Passive Resistance, for a Passive Resister has to frame his minimum as well as his maximum and he dare not ask for more nor can he be satisfied with less.
('15', 16, 2, 9, 30055) But I do not wish to be understood to mean that nothing further remains to be done in South Africa, or that everything has been gained.
('15', 16, 2, 10, 30191) We have only fought for removal of legal disabilities as to immigration, but administratively it tells more heavily upon us than other nations.
('15', 16, 2, 11, 30335) In accepting administrative inequality, we have given due regard to existing conditions and prejudices.
('15', 16, 2, 12, 30439) 4 We fought to keep the theory of the British Constitution intact so that practice may some day approach the theory as near as possible.
('15', 16, 2, 13, 30576) There are still certain laws in South Africa, for instance, the Law 3 of 1885, Trade Licence Laws of the Cape and Natal which continue to cause worry.

('15', 16, 3, 16, 30817) At the time of the settlement, the points of Passive Resistance were as follows: 2 The published letter has I consider instead of are considered.
('15', 16, 3, 17, 30963) 3 In the published letter, this portion of the sentence reads:  .

('15', 16, 3, 19, 31061)  4 In the published letter, these two sentences are replaced by the following: We have only fought for removal of legal disabilities as to immigration but administratively we have taken note of existing conditions and prejudices.

('15', 17, 1, 2, 31332) Administration of the Immigration Law is not all it should be.
('15', 17, 1, 3, 31395) For these, however, Passive Resistance [is not] applied and is at present inapplicable, its application being confined to grievances which are generally felt in a community and are known to hurt its self respect or conscience.
('15', 17, 1, 4, 31622) Any of our 1 grievances referred to by me may any day advance to that stage.
('15', 17, 1, 5, 31699) Till then only the ordinary remedies of petition, etc., can be and are at present being applied 2. Letters received from South Africa show that difficulties are being experienced in some cases acutely by our countrymen and if not much has been heard of them in India just now, it is because of the extraordinary self restraint of our countrymen in South Africa during the crisis that has overtaken the Empire.
('15', 17, 1, 6, 32109) This struggle has defined principles and removed disabilities which were in the shape of a national insult.
('15', 17, 1, 7, 32217) The larger question of the treatment of British Indians who came there 3 from outside can only be dealt with here 4 and for the question of the local disabilities still unredressed, your Committee will have to exercise a ceaseless watch and assist as heretofore the efforts of our countrymen in South Africa.
('15', 17, 1, 8, 32526) I feel that I ought to place on record my strong conviction, based upon close personal observation extending over a period of twenty years, that the system of indentured emigration is an evil which cannot be mended but can only be ended.
('15', 17, 1, 9, 32764) No matter how humane the employers may be, it does not lend itself to the moral well being of the men affected by it.
('15', 17, 1, 10, 32882) I therefore feel that your Committee should lose no time in approaching the Government of India with a view to securing entire abolition of the system for every part of the Empire.
('15', 17, 1, 11, 33063) Before closing, I am bound to mention that the struggle would not have ended so soon and even as satisfactorily as it did, but for the generous support rendered by the Motherland under the leadership of the great and saintly patriot whose death we all mourn and but for the very sympathetic and firm attitude taken by the noble man who at present occupies the Viceregal chair.

('15', 20, 8, 12, 36411) Narandas.
('15', 20, 8, 13, 36421) That ultimately he is to live with me is his own desire as also yours and mine.
('15', 20, 8, 14, 36501) My only purpose in employing Narandas in a job is that thereby he should earn something and contribute to your expenses.
('15', 20, 8, 15, 36622) I feel that you should fix the figure of your needs, and that I should meet them and that you should then free Narandas.
('15', 20, 8, 16, 36743) The Ashram needs one or two persons.
('15', 20, 8, 17, 36780) If Narandas comes, the need will be met.
('15', 20, 8, 18, 36821) I am looking for someone whom I can engage as a paid assistant.
('15', 20, 8, 19, 36885) Why should I then not give the opportunity to Narandas?
('15', 20, 8, 20, 36941) Maganlal and Manilal are kept fully occupied with the teaching of Sanskrit and they are quite engrossed in it.
('15', 20, 8, 21, 37052) This being so, we are short of teachers.
('15', 20, 8, 22, 37093) On myself also, I have placed an excessive burden, with the result that I have to leave undone some other things which require my attention.
('15', 20, 8, 23, 37234) Hence, if Narandas joins me, I will be saved from many difficulties.
('15', 20, 8, 24, 37303) Please do not think of the matter from a purely worldly point of view.
('15', 20, 8, 25, 37374) Consider only what is good for Narandas and for us all in coming to a decision.
('15', 20, 8, 26, 37454) Since Narandas also will read this letter, I am not writing to him
('15', 20, 9, 27, 37521) 1 From the reference to Narandas, it appears that this letter was written before the one to the addressee dated September 24, 1915. Jeth Sud 11 in the year 1915 corresponded to June 23.

('15', 21, 7, 9, 38004) MY DEAR FRIEND, Your letters, last two, have been brief and contained a trace of bitterness.
('15', 21, 7, 10, 38097) The bitterness was due to the brevity of my letters.
('15', 21, 7, 11, 38150) But if you knew the rush under which I have been living you would not have grumbled.
('15', 21, 7, 12, 38235) You might have imagined that during that time the letters to you were the only writing work that I probably did.
('15', 21, 7, 13, 38348) I hope however that your next letter will be less gloomy.
('15', 21, 7, 14, 38406) Your overlooking the diary is a fatal omission.
('15', 21, 7, 15, 38454) The omission too is partly due, I fear, to anger.
('15', 21, 7, 16, 38504) But it is again a fall.
('15', 21, 7, 17, 38528) Do please resume the diary.
('15', 21, 7, 18, 38556) I am having extraordinary difficulties.
('15', 21, 7, 19, 38596) I do not know that what they mean.
('15', 21, 7, 20, 38631) I can only hope that they will chasten us all.
('15', 21, 7, 21, 38678) The difficulties arise from our strangely simple life.
('15', 21, 7, 22, 38733) The people around us do not understand us.
('15', 21, 7, 23, 38776) There is one man who strikes and swears at the boys and prevents them even from using water we are entitled to.
('15', 21, 7, 24, 38888) Things are getting better somewhat.
('15', 21, 7, 25, 38924) But new situations give rise to new difficulties.

('15', 22, 7, 11, 39990) THE GENERAL TRAFFIC MANAGER G. I. P. RAILWAY BOMBAY
('15', 22, 8, 12, 40042) SIR, I travelled on the 27th instant from Poona to Bombay on 3rd class return ticket, taking the 16.45 train last Saturday from Kirkee.
('15', 22, 8, 13, 40178) As my ticket was only as far as Dadar and as I wished to go as far as Victoria Terminus, I informed an official that I was travelling beyond my destination.
('15', 22, 8, 14, 40335) I attempted to give the information at Dadar but succeeded in giving it only at Parel.
('15', 22, 8, 15, 40422) The official, who I subsequently learnt was a brakesman, told me to inform the bada 2 Guard.
('15', 22, 8, 16, 40515) I could not do so as he was in a far off compartment.
('15', 22, 8, 17, 40569) At Masjid the authorities collected from me the fare from Dadar and the usual penalty, notwithstanding my protest.
('15', 22, 8, 18, 40684) They ascertained too from the brakesman that I had duly informed him.
('15', 22, 8, 19, 40754) The authorities at Masjid said that in order to enable them to exempt me from the penalty, I should produce a certificate from the Guard or the Station Master.
('15', 22, 8, 20, 40914) You will see that I could not procure the certificate without the risk of missing the train.
('15', 22, 8, 21, 41007) I asked for the certificate from the only official whom I could safely approach.
('15', 22, 8, 22, 41088) And he would not grant one.
('15', 22, 8, 23, 41116) I bring this incident to your notice as I have often observed that 3rd class

('15', 23, 1, 3, 41335) I shall be obliged if you will kindly inquire into this matter.
('15', 23, 1, 4, 41399) In my opinion, either Station Masters should be instructed not to charge penalties when information has been given about over travelling to any railway official of the company or strict instructions should be given as to promp issue of certificates by the officials concerned.
('15', 23, 1, 5, 41676) If it was not competent for the brakesman to issue the certificate, was it not his duty to immediately inform the Guard that a passenger wasover travelling and that he had applied for the usual certificate?
('15', 23, 1, 6, 41883) I enclose herewith the receipt for this fare and the penalty.

('15', 23, 8, 15, 42256) But imagine a person travelling almost continuously in a crowded 3rd class compartment and being besieged by visitors immediately on landing.
('15', 23, 8, 16, 42398) What is one to say in such circumstances?
('15', 23, 8, 17, 42440) I did not during my travels get a moment to myself.
('15', 23, 8, 18, 42492) And now too it is continuous work.
('15', 23, 8, 19, 42527) But I can now attend to some of my correspondence.
('15', 23, 8, 20, 42578) Dr. Mehta asks me whether I am going to try for your entry here.
('15', 23, 8, 21, 42643) It is an impossibility.
('15', 23, 8, 22, 42667) Things are becoming stricter and there seems to be no way out of the difficulty.
('15', 23, 8, 23, 42748) At the same time I am going to make a desperate effort when I meet the Viceroy in the natural course.
('15', 23, 9, 24, 42850) 1 In his reply dated July 18, the Acting Deputy Traffic Manager (Commercial) said: From enquiries made, I find that you did not intimate at Dadar your intention to ride on to V. Terminus, and since you had already ridden as far as Parel before any intimation was given to the train staff, you were correctly encessed, and I cannot grant you any relief. 2 From the contents

('15', 24, 1, 2, 43264) The medal has worried me.
('15', 24, 1, 3, 43290) It was announced without con sultation.
('15', 24, 1, 4, 43330) To refuse a medal would have been churlish.
('15', 24, 1, 5, 43374) I therefore said nothing about it.
('15', 24, 1, 6, 43409) I wrote a note to the Viceroy when at length a formal letter conferring the medal came to me.
('15', 24, 1, 7, 43503) It is not considered the same as a title.
('15', 24, 1, 8, 43545) It was presented last week 1at a Government at home.

('15', 24, 2, 11, 43702) She has lost faith in my treatment.
('15', 24, 2, 12, 43738) She has become a most difficult patient.
('15', 24, 3, 13, 43779) I am receiving much critism on the scheme.
('15', 24, 3, 14, 43822) I may some day be able to send you copies of some of it.
('15', 24, 3, 15, 43879) Here as you may imagine, I have no copying assistance.
('15', 24, 4, 16, 43934) I am myself keeping fairly well.
('15', 24, 4, 17, 43967) Somehow or other I cannot regain my original vigour.
('15', 24, 5, 18, 44020) My food just now is only nuts and dried figs or dates and lemons.
('15', 24, 5, 19, 44086) We are badly off for fruit in this place.

('15', 25, 6, 6, 45040) AHMEDABAD, July 9 [1915] 1
('15', 25, 7, 7, 45067) MY DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('15', 25, 7, 8, 45103) I must say I feel nothing about your being interned.
('15', 25, 7, 9, 45156) It was to come.
('15', 25, 7, 10, 45172) You have a rare opportunity for disciplining yourself and of affecting your neighbours.
('15', 25, 7, 11, 45260) You will have plenty of time to think.
('15', 25, 7, 12, 45299) This prolongation may mean more prolonged sepa ration between us.
('15', 25, 7, 13, 45365) But we shall learn to live together more intimately even though we may be separated bodily.
('15', 25, 7, 14, 45457) In thousand and one things I miss you.
('15', 25, 7, 15, 45496) In some experiences I feel glad you are not with me.
('15', 25, 7, 16, 45549) In fullness of time, when we meet, we shall [have] grown, let us hope, better and better able to reach our common goal.
('15', 25, 7, 17, 45669) The life here has become most regular and nobody has leisure for idle talk.
('15', 25, 7, 18, 45745) Boys who wanted to have their ambition fulfilled, I do not encroach upon their time for study.
('15', 25, 7, 19, 45840) They appreciate this very much.
('15', 25, 7, 20, 45872) My diet just now consists of soaked figs, monkey nuts and lemons.
('15', 25, 7, 21, 45938) This is a somewhat trying place for cheap fruit.
('15', 25, 7, 22, 45987) Those who were saltless remain so here also and some now and then become fruitarians for a week or so.
('15', 25, 7, 23, 46090) All are learning Hindi, Sanskrit, Tamil, Gujarati and Arithmetic.
('15', 25, 7, 24, 46156) They have 4 hours of study, apart from their morning study.
('15', 25, 7, 25, 46216) How about your cabinet making?
('15', 25, 7, 26, 46247) This ought not to be interrupted.

('15', 26, 2, 3, 46543) July 11, 1915
('15', 26, 3, 4, 46557) MR. PRESIDENT, BROTHERS AND SISTERS, Perhaps, it is impudent on my part to add anything to the feeling words that have been spoken by Mrs. Ranade.
('15', 26, 3, 5, 46704) The fact that she is the widow of the masters master adds solemnity to the proceedings, which I can only mar by any remarks I may make.
('15', 26, 3, 6, 46840) But, claiming as I do to be one of Mr. Gokhales disciples, you will forgive me if I say a few words which are personal titbits.
('15', 26, 3, 7, 46968) It was on board the Cronprinz some years ago, 2 that I found myself in the masters company together with a common friend, Mr. Kallenbach 3, a German.
('15', 26, 3, 8, 47118) Let me say that all Germans are not fiends, nor; are all German soldiers Friend.
('15', 26, 3, 9, 47199) 4 Mr. Kallenbach is a German and a soldier, but I feel that no purer minded person to day walks the earth in Europe than Mr. Kallenbach.
('15', 26, 3, 10, 47336) He was accepted as a worthy companion by Mr. Gokhale, who used to play with him the game of quoits.
('15', 26, 3, 11, 47436) Mr. Gokhale had just then, during the voyage from England to Cape Town, picked up that g ame, and he very nearly gave Mr. Kallenbach a beating in the game.
('15', 26, 3, 12, 47592) I fancy that was a drawn game between them, and, let me add, Mr. Kallenbach, so far as I am aware, is one of the cleverest players of quoits in South Africa.
('15', 26, 3, 13, 47750) Just after that we had our meals at which Mr. Gokhale was talking to me with reference to the result of the game.
('15', 26, 3, 14, 47864) He thought I never indulged in such sports and that I was against them.
('15', 26, 3, 15, 47936) He expostulated with me in kind words and said, Do you know why I want to enter into such competition with Europeans?
('15', 26, 3, 16, 48054) I certainly want to do at least as much as
('15', 26, 4, 17, 48097) 1 While seconding the following resolution moved by Mrs. Ramabai Ranade: The Conference places on record its sense of, profound grief at the irreparable loss the country and the Empire have sustained in the untimely and the universally mourned death of the late Mr. Gopal Krishna Gokhale, than whom no more self sacrificing and devoted patriot and no more far sighted statesman ever consecrated his life in the cause of his country. 2 In 1912 3 Gandhijis co worker in South Africa, who had placed at the disposal of the satyagrahis the Tolstoy Farm; Vide Letter to H. Kallenbach, 30 5 1910. 4 During the First World War, Britain and, with her, India considered Germany as an enemy country
('15', 27, 0, 1, 48786) 28 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 27, 1, 2, 48827) they can do for the sake of our country.
('15', 27, 1, 3, 48868) It is said, rightly or wrongly, that we are an inferior people in many matters, and so far as I can do itand this he said in all humilityI certainly want to show that we are at least their equals, if not their superiors. That was one incident.
('15', 27, 1, 4, 49112) On board the same steamer, we were engaged in a hot discussion in connection with.
('15', 27, 1, 5, 49195) our dear motherland, and he was mapping out for me, as a father would for his child, a programme that I was to follow in India if I ever happened to see the motherland again, and, in connection therewith, there was one thing he said: We lack in India character; we want religious zeal in the political field. Shall we then follow the spirit of the master with the same thoroughness and the same religious zeal, so that we can safely teach a child politics?
('15', 27, 1, 6, 49652) One of his missions in life, I think, was to inculcate the lesson that whatever we do, we should do with thoroughness.
('15', 27, 1, 7, 49771) This it is not possible for us mortals to imitate in any degree of perfection.
('15', 27, 1, 8, 49850) Whatever he did, he did with a religious zeal; that was the secret of his success.
('15', 27, 1, 9, 49933) He did not wear his religion on his sleeve; he lived it.
('15', 27, 1, 10, 49990) Whatever he touched, he purified; wherever he went, he recreated an atmosphere around him which was fragrant.
('15', 27, 1, 11, 50100) When he came to South Africa, he electrified the people there not only by his magnificent eloquence but by the sincerity of his character and by the religious devotion with which he worked.
('15', 27, 1, 12, 50290) What was that devotion?
('15', 27, 1, 13, 50314) Ailing though he was, he was awake the whole night practically when he was to have seen General Smuts; he did so in order to prepare the case for his countrymen with a thoroughness that surprised the leader of the Boer Government.
('15', 27, 1, 14, 50545) What was the result?
('15', 27, 1, 15, 50566) The result was that he got the promise from the South African Government that the 3 tax would be gone in a few years, and the 3 tax is no more.
('15', 27, 1, 16, 50710) It is no more there to grind down so many thousands of our countrymen.
('15', 27, 1, 17, 50781) Mr. Gokhale is dead, but it is possible for you and for me to make his spirit live in us and through us.
('15', 27, 1, 18, 50886) (Hear, hear.) We are about to pass resolutions which would expect us, the chosen representatives, or, it may be, the self elected representatives of the people to do certain things.
('15', 27, 1, 19, 51068) Shall we discharge our trust with the masters devotion?
('15', 27, 1, 20, 51124) The people we represent will base their verdict not upon our speeches but upon our actions, and how shall we act?
('15', 27, 1, 21, 51238) We have a right to pass this resolution if we act in the spirit of the master.
('15', 27, 1, 22, 51317) With these words, I have much pleasure in seconding this resolution.

('15', 29, 9, 11, 53428) MY DEAR FRIEND, There is no letter from you for this week.
('15', 29, 9, 12, 53487) There is a pencil letter from you complaining of want of news from me.
('15', 29, 9, 13, 53558) Events have moved with me so swiftly that I did not know what to say and what to omit.
('15', 29, 9, 14, 53645) Names of men and places I omitted as I could not give you the history of men and geography of places I visited.
('15', 29, 9, 15, 53757) Bolpur I left as it never was the intention to settle down there.
('15', 29, 9, 16, 53823) The boys services were required in the nursing department at a fair in a holy place and they left.
('15', 29, 9, 17, 53922) They then went to Gurukul whilst I was touring through Madras.
('15', 29, 9, 18, 53985) After finishing Madras I took up quarters at Ahmedabad and sent for the company.
('15', 29, 9, 19, 54066) At Madras the two friends who interested themselves in the scheme are lawyers of note.
('15', 29, 9, 20, 54153) But so many have interested themselves in it.
('15', 29, 9, 21, 54199) Few are willing to adopt it themselves.

('15', 30, 1, 2, 54611) However I feel that it is the right thing.
('15', 30, 1, 3, 54654) There is something noble in a 7 year old lad thinking he is working for his meal and he is studying for his country.
('15', 30, 1, 4, 54771) There is something great if a boy of seven does not look forward to leaving the place when he is learning and altering his life.
('15', 30, 1, 5, 54900) After a number of years whether many will do this or not is not the question.
('15', 30, 1, 6, 54978) What is of importance is that some are making a serious attempt to live such a life.
('15', 30, 1, 7, 55063) There was a verse we read at the morning prayer today.
('15', 30, 1, 8, 55118) Pain and pleasure, happiness and misery are without doubt results of some previous causes set in motion by ourselves. This thought gives us the faculty for bearing pains without fear or anxiety.
('15', 30, 1, 9, 55313) If we add to this the thought that what passes as a misery may not be misery at all but divine discipline.
('15', 30, 1, 10, 55420) 1 If a man about to commit a heinous crime is prevented by snake bite from fulfilling his purpose, the bite was surely a blessing for him.
('15', 30, 1, 11, 55559) Our analysis of events is often faulty.
('15', 30, 1, 12, 55599) The remedy therefore lies in trying to remain unaffected by outward circumstances.

('15', 31, 8, 17, 57597) MY DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter, also the cable sent by Mr. Turner to whom I am writing.
('15', 31, 8, 18, 57689) I do not know that you expected any cable in reply.
('15', 31, 8, 19, 57741) My heart is with you.
('15', 31, 8, 20, 57763) I have unpacked our goods and as a perpetual reminder I am using your favourite wooden pillow which you will recall you did not want to leave behind.
('15', 31, 8, 21, 57913) In trying to reduce things to order, I ever think of you, I ever miss you.
('15', 31, 8, 22, 57988) As it is, I am simply preparing the house as if I wanted to receive you.
('15', 31, 8, 23, 58061) That is, you are positively with me when I am cleaning up the compound and the closets.
('15', 31, 8, 24, 58149) I ask myself whether you would approve of my work and the method of cleaning.
('15', 31, 8, 25, 58227) Your suggestions and your nose I miss so much.
('15', 31, 8, 26, 58274) But for better or for worse we must live for some time in physical separation.
('15', 31, 8, 27, 58353) Only we must so act that we should be nearer in spirit if we have to put up with this enforced physical separation.

('15', 32, 2, 3, 58860) Your life there must be a model for the others.
('15', 32, 2, 4, 58908) How I would love to think that you are there vindicating your German birth, your ancestral faith and our joint ideals.
('15', 32, 2, 5, 59027) You vindicate the first two if you realize the third.
('15', 32, 2, 6, 59081) And i know you will not fail.
('15', 32, 3, 7, 59111) I shall expect from you a full description of the life there.
('15', 32, 4, 8, 59173) I hope you will allow anything there to irritate you and that you will act with the greatest calmness of mind and sufficient detachment.
('15', 32, 5, 9, 59310) Life here is growing sweeter I think.
('15', 32, 5, 10, 59348) It is difficult but worth trying.
('15', 32, 5, 11, 59382) More and more order is being evolved.
('15', 32, 5, 12, 59420) Narandas, Maganlals brother, is also coming to us.
('15', 32, 5, 13, 59471) That means that all the boys of this particular cousin of mine are to devote themselves to this kind of life.
('15', 32, 5, 14, 59581) It is wonderful sacrifice.
('15', 32, 5, 15, 59608) Narandas you will love when you see him.
('15', 32, 5, 16, 59649) There is something so good about all the Chhaganlal brothers.
('15', 32, 5, 17, 59711) My brothers boys and their wives have disappointed me completely and so has my sister 1. This is strange.
('15', 32, 5, 18, 59817) And yet not quite so strange.
('15', 32, 5, 19, 59847) Harilal is more and more going away from me.
('15', 32, 5, 20, 59892) What was before hard for him to follow is now not even worth following.
('15', 32, 5, 21, 59964) He has come to the conclusion that there is nothing good in the institution.
('15', 32, 5, 22, 60041) Such is the might of inertia.

('15', 33, 3, 10, 60817) It will be advisable to have this done through some lawyer friend of yours there.

('15', 33, 9, 24, 61527) These should be duly advertised in the press and there should certainly be vigorous newspaper agitation.

('15', 34, 7, 8, 62384) The subject of physical contact [whether it is rightly prohibited] is a large one.
('15', 34, 7, 9, 62467) I think we are committing a great sin in treating a whole class of people as untouchables and it is owing to the existence of this class that we have still some revolting practices among us.
('15', 34, 7, 10, 62658) Not to eat in company with a particular person and not to touch him are two very different things.
('15', 34, 7, 11, 62757) No one is an untouchable now.
('15', 34, 7, 12, 62787) If we dont mind contact with a Christian or a Muslim, why should we mind it with one belonging to our own religion?
('15', 34, 7, 13, 62903) No defence of untouchability is possible now, either from the point of view of justice or that of practical common sense.

('15', 35, 4, 7, 63575) I have not even read the things you are referring to.
('15', 35, 4, 8, 63629) The conversations between us were private and must remain so.
('15', 35, 4, 9, 63691) The draft sent by you hardly does justice to the interview.
('15', 35, 4, 10, 63751) I never said that I spoke for the Congress party or with its authority.
('15', 35, 4, 11, 63823) I simply came as a friend and admirer and for friends.
('15', 35, 4, 12, 63878) I did not know what view the Congress party would take.
('15', 35, 4, 13, 63934) I simply put a tentative proposal before you.

('15', 39, 3, 7, 69477) They want to retain you longer for their own purpose; this, they cannot do.
('15', 39, 3, 8, 69553) Even during September, you should have only to go for their case, for a day or two, at their expense.
('15', 39, 3, 9, 69655) Directors are always much too greedy and look at only one side of a question.

('15', 40, 4, 5, 70650) MY DEAR FRIEND,
('15', 40, 5, 6, 70666) I have not missed more than two weeks to my knowledge.
('15', 40, 5, 7, 70721) So when you do not get my letters, you will presume that the fault is not mine.
('15', 40, 6, 8, 70801) I am glad you have received all the things in good order.
('15', 40, 6, 9, 70859) Have you been using the sticks?

('15', 40, 7, 14, 71061) He has not yet decided how he will act in India.
('15', 40, 7, 15, 71110) He does not feel like joining me.
('15', 40, 7, 16, 71144) Jamnadas too has gone back to Rajkot.
('15', 40, 7, 17, 71182) His is a pathetic case.
('15', 40, 7, 18, 71206) He is most undecided.
('15', 40, 7, 19, 71228) I can weave Indian tape.
('15', 40, 7, 20, 71253) The mechanical arrangement is very simple.
('15', 40, 7, 21, 71296) Here it is.
('15', 40, 8, 22, 71308) It represents a bunch of strings that receives the warp.
('15', 40, 8, 23, 71365) A wooden knife serves to press the woof home.
('15', 40, 8, 24, 71411) A bobbin made of reed unwinds the woof.
('15', 40, 8, 25, 71451) The tape is from half an inch to two inches in width.

('15', 41, 3, 4, 71949) MY DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('15', 41, 3, 5, 71985) The life here is becoming more and more intense.
('15', 41, 3, 6, 72034) We have now a handloom on the premises.
('15', 41, 3, 7, 72074) It is calculated that it will start work tomorrow.
('15', 41, 3, 8, 72125) I hope to send you the pattern we may turn out.
('15', 41, 3, 9, 72173) Manilal is fully occupied in that work.
('15', 41, 3, 10, 72213) Languages occupy most of the inmates.
('15', 41, 3, 11, 72251) Thus there is hardly a minute free for anybody.
('15', 41, 3, 12, 72299) They have all become very studious.
('15', 41, 3, 13, 72335) Poor Ramdas has always some ailment or another and I find it difficult to get him to reach his original strength.
('15', 41, 3, 14, 72449) I am trying hard.
('15', 41, 3, 15, 72467) The others are keeping well.
('15', 41, 3, 16, 72496) Manilal is becoming stouter.
('15', 41, 3, 17, 72525) Maganlal is regaining his strength.
('15', 41, 3, 18, 72561) Mrs. Gandhi has become very active again.
('15', 41, 3, 19, 72603) I expect a collapse any day.
('15', 41, 3, 20, 72632) Such is life here.
('15', 41, 3, 21, 72651) Your presence can complete the life.
('15', 41, 3, 22, 72688) We sang this evening When I survey the wondrous cross.
('15', 41, 3, 23, 72743) How nice it would have been to have had you to join!

('15', 41, 8, 33, 73174) They are all Tamils and in each case overeating is the cause.

('15', 42, 1, 4, 73403) The third is a new man from Madras.
('15', 42, 1, 5, 73439) Then we have rearrangement in the Ashram as we have a paid carpenter now working in the premises.

('15', 44, 9, 22, 77470) This is an extreme step.
('15', 44, 9, 23, 77495) It caused a breach between Mrs. Gandhi and myself.

('15', 45, 6, 11, 78301) DEAR MR. SHASTRIAR, When I took in Naiker, Mrs. Gandhi did not kick.
('15', 45, 6, 12, 78370) Now I had to decide whether I was to take in a grown up Gujarati Dhed 2 with his wife.
('15', 45, 6, 13, 78457) 3 I decided to take him and she rebelled against it and so did another lady at the Ashram.
('15', 45, 6, 14, 78548) There was quite a flutter in the Ashram.
('15', 45, 6, 15, 78589) There is a flutter even in Ahmedabad.
('15', 45, 6, 16, 78627) I have told Mrs. Gandhi she could leave me and we should part good friends.
('15', 45, 6, 17, 78703) The step is momentous because it so links me with the suppressed classes mission that I might have at no distant time to carry out the idea of shifting to some Dhed quarters and sharing their life with the Dheds.
('15', 45, 6, 18, 78916) It would mean much even for my staunchest co workers.
('15', 45, 6, 19, 78970) I have now given you the outline of the story.
('15', 45, 6, 20, 79017) There is nothing grand about it.
('15', 45, 6, 21, 79050) It is of importance to me because it enables me to demonstrate the efficacy of passive resistance in social questions and when I take the final step, it will embrace swaraj, etc.

('15', 46, 4, 9, 80182) These included Ramdas and Devdas.
('15', 46, 4, 10, 80216) They were all treated after our fashion partial or total starvation and hip baths.
('15', 46, 4, 11, 80299) You know what a Pariah is.
('15', 46, 4, 12, 80326) He is what is called an untouchable.
('15', 46, 4, 13, 80363) The widows son whom I have taken is a Pariah but that did not shock Mrs. Gandhi so much.
('15', 46, 4, 14, 80452) Now I have taken one from our own parts and Mrs.Gandhi as also Maganlals wife were up in arms against me.
('15', 46, 4, 15, 80558) They made my life miserable so far as they could.
('15', 46, 4, 16, 80608) I told them they were not bound to stay with me.
('15', 46, 4, 17, 80657) This irritated them the more.
('15', 46, 4, 18, 80687) The storm has not yet subsided.
('15', 46, 4, 19, 80719) I am however unmoved and comparatively calm.
('15', 46, 4, 20, 80764) The step I have taken means a great deal.
('15', 46, 4, 21, 80806) It may alter my life a bit, i.e., I may have to completely take up Pariah work, i.e., I might have to become a Pariah myself.
('15', 46, 4, 22, 80932) We shall see.
('15', 46, 4, 23, 80946) Anyway let my troubles brace you up if they can.
('15', 46, 4, 24, 80995) Andrews and Pearson were with me for a day.
('15', 46, 4, 25, 81039) I lent the latter some of your books.
('15', 46, 4, 26, 81077) They are both on their way to Fiji in order to investigate the indenture question.
('15', 46, 4, 27, 81160) Harilal was here for a few days.
('15', 46, 4, 28, 81193) He is gone.
('15', 46, 4, 29, 81205) His wife is here with her children.
('15', 46, 4, 30, 81241) I am sending you a piece of cloth from what has been woven by us.
('15', 46, 4, 31, 81307) It is Manilals work.
('15', 46, 4, 32, 81328) Sewing is mine and Devdass.
('15', 46, 4, 33, 81356) May it serve to wipe your hand and may the spirit that has prompted the gift serve to strengthen the inner man in you.
('15', 46, 4, 34, 81475) With love,

('15', 47, 1, 2, 81628) 57. LETTER TO KHUSHALCHAND GANDHI
('15', 47, 2, 3, 81662) AHMEDABAD, Bhadarva Vad 1, September 24, 1915
('15', 47, 3, 4, 81708) RESPECTED KHUSHALBHAI, I realized after meeting Narandas that you repent having given him the permission and the chief cause for remorse is that I have admitted a learned dhea 1 [to the ashram] .
('15', 47, 3, 5, 81904) That would have hurt the feelings of Santok too.
('15', 47, 3, 6, 81953) In fact, no one should feel bad about it because in Phoenix we shared food with everyone.
('15', 47, 3, 7, 82043) But the same thing is viewed differently here.
('15', 47, 3, 8, 82090) There is no need for you to feel sorry.
('15', 47, 3, 9, 82130) Narandas has taken a very good step.
('15', 47, 3, 10, 82167) If I was not worried about the unhappiness of my sister in law, I would have boldly asked Narandas to come here.
('15', 47, 3, 11, 82280) However, on considering everything, I thought it was better for Narandas to go to Madras with his wife.
('15', 47, 3, 12, 82384) There Tamil....
('15', 47, 3, 13, 82400) 2 Santok and the two girls are going.
('15', 47, 3, 14, 82438) Maganlal is accompanying them to Bombay today.
('15', 47, 3, 15, 82485) By doing so, Narandas, Jamna, Santok and the girls would not be caught in the storm 3 that threatens the Ashram.
('15', 47, 3, 16, 82598) They would not be banished from the caste and so their sorrow will be a little less.
('15', 47, 3, 17, 82683) Jamnadas is no doubt there.
('15', 47, 3, 18, 82711) There is no need for him to come here.
('15', 47, 3, 19, 82750) It is Chhaganlals duty to stay on in Phoenix.
('15', 47, 3, 20, 82796) Now remain Maganlal and his children.
('15', 47, 3, 21, 82834) Let him be caught in the storm along with me.
('15', 47, 3, 22, 82880) Those who live with me, should never expect that they will never have external problems because those who live with me should learn to welcome problems and realize that purification lies in that.
('15', 47, 3, 23, 83076) I have told Maganlal that he should go to Madras for a short period if he wanted to.
('15', 47, 3, 24, 83161) There is no objection if Maganlal goes to Madras and Narandas comes here.
('15', 47, 3, 25, 83235) I have asked the two brothers to do what is convenient to them.
('15', 47, 3, 26, 83299) I am going to fulfil your desire once Narandas is relieved from his job.

('15', 47, 4, 28, 83424) 3 As a consequence of Gandhijis decision to admit an untouchable family to the Ashram.

('15', 48, 1, 2, 83599) I do not think that a more satisfactory arrangement can be worked out.
('15', 48, 1, 3, 83670) It contains truth and dharma indeed is included in it.
('15', 48, 1, 4, 83725) I wish that you should be at peace.

('15', 48, 7, 11, 83947) MAGANLAL, I have again written 2 to respected Khushalbhai.
('15', 48, 7, 12, 84006) You should handle the situation there quite calmly.
('15', 48, 7, 13, 84058) Do what will please the self.
('15', 48, 7, 14, 84088) If Santok wants to return, let her.
('15', 48, 7, 15, 84124) It will be all right even if she goes to Madras.
('15', 48, 7, 16, 84173) She need only observe all the Ashram rules there.
('15', 48, 7, 17, 84223) If you want, you may stay on there [for some time] or go to Madras.
('15', 48, 7, 18, 84291) There have been two letters for you, which, for the present, I dont send on.
('15', 48, 7, 19, 84368) Narandas should remain determined.
('15', 48, 7, 20, 84403) He should be confident and fearless about the future.
('15', 48, 7, 21, 84457) Keshu came round very soon.
('15', 48, 7, 22, 84485) Already, he is playing about today.
('15', 48, 7, 23, 84521) Two of his different groups [of subjects] are under my charge.
('15', 48, 7, 24, 84584) I am therefore in a better position to observe how he does.
('15', 48, 7, 25, 84644) Purushottam 3 has felt nothing.
('15', 48, 7, 26, 84676) He had his usual meal.
('15', 48, 7, 27, 84699) Dudabhai will arrive on Sunday morning.
('15', 48, 7, 28, 84739) Things have been happening at Phoenix, it seems.
('15', 48, 7, 29, 84788) 4 Chhaganlal appears to have cut off his connection altogether.
('15', 48, 7, 30, 84852) The price of Indian Opinion has been reduced to one penny.
('15', 48, 7, 31, 84911) It seems he has been hasty.
('15', 48, 7, 32, 84939) This also must be for a good end.
('15', 48, 7, 33, 84973) More when you are here.

('15', 49, 6, 7, 85428) AHMEDABAD, September 26 [1915] 1
('15', 49, 7, 8, 85461) MY DEAR WEST, I have your typewritten letter.
('15', 49, 7, 9, 85507) I note the changes made and I accept them.
('15', 49, 7, 10, 85550) The central idea is that Indian Opinion should be kept up at any cost.
('15', 49, 7, 11, 85621) If you can be totally independent of public support, i.e., from the Passive Resistance Fund, so much the better.
('15', 49, 7, 12, 85734) This means revision of the account sent to you by me.
('15', 49, 8, 13, 85788) Fortunately there was delay on my side.
('15', 49, 8, 14, 85828) The new scheme requires a revision which I shall do shortly.
('15', 49, 8, 15, 85889) I am not going to keep the large sum with me but it will be handed over to the Trust.
('15', 49, 8, 16, 85975) As for part of the payment to Pragji 3 and Imam Saheb 4 being, debited to the P. R. Fund, I am inclined to think that they were present at the meeting, where the matter was settled.
('15', 49, 8, 17, 86157) But if they object, the amounts could be debited to the P. R. Fund as assistance to Indian Opinion.
('15', 49, 8, 18, 86257) In either case, the money has to come from the P. R. Fund.
('15', 49, 8, 19, 86316) It was debited by way of relief as the whole amount could not be a legitimate charge against Indian Opinion.
('15', 49, 8, 20, 86425) But for their being passiveresisters, we could not have availed ourselves of their services.
('15', 49, 8, 21, 86518) But it was a matter of account keeping.
('15', 49, 8, 22, 86558) I should be prepared to defend the outlay in any case.
('15', 49, 8, 23, 86613) Unless Chhaganlal is bodily incapable, his withdrawal from

('15', 50, 1, 2, 87051) Indian Opinion is a bad sign.
('15', 50, 1, 3, 87081) However I must not grumble.
('15', 50, 1, 4, 87109) You who are on the spot must know what is best.
('15', 50, 1, 5, 87157) The ideals we are working are common to us and you will work according to your own way.
('15', 50, 1, 6, 87245) Hence the Phoenix Trust.
('15', 50, 1, 7, 87270) I can only advise from this distance.
('15', 50, 1, 8, 87308) Auditing, if it is to cost anything appreciable, is useless.
('15', 50, 1, 9, 87369) Our books contain all the transactions.
('15', 50, 1, 10, 87409) The bank balance represents the savings from the Fund, etc.
('15', 50, 1, 11, 87469) However, even in this matter you know best what should be done.
('15', 50, 1, 12, 87533) Mr. Rustomjees warning is now superfluous as I shall not be handling the funds any more.
('15', 50, 1, 13, 87622) For the Phoenix funds there are the trustees and they may, subject to the sanction of the schemers, do the needful.
('15', 50, 1, 14, 87738) This exhaust the points raised by you.
('15', 50, 1, 15, 87777) The amount fixed for Polak should stand until he himself feels that he can dispense with it.

('15', 50, 9, 30, 88493) I have told you that a time may come when I may irresistibly take a step which may result in my being left alone.

('15', 51, 7, 11, 88978) MY DEAR FRIEND, I have to make this Herculean effort just now under extraordinary difficulties.
('15', 51, 7, 12, 89074) It is now nearing 9 p.m.
('15', 51, 7, 13, 89099) Mrs. Gandhi who has been making my life hell for me is just now at me.
('15', 51, 7, 14, 89170) But I must not miss this weekly communion.
('15', 51, 7, 15, 89213) I give you this news to show that peace is not to be found from without.
('15', 51, 7, 16, 89286) I am not at war with myself in spite of the disturbance I have mentioned above.
('15', 51, 7, 17, 89366) She however does succeed in making me angry at times and throwing me off my balance.

('15', 52, 4, 5, 89941) MY DEAR FRIEND, I hope you have received my letter the one that did not reach you in time.
('15', 52, 4, 6, 90032) There was no omission [on] my side.
('15', 52, 4, 7, 90068) We are all so short handed that I do not like to ask anyone to write to you.
('15', 52, 5, 8, 90145) Here there is no extensive piece of ground for cultivation hardly one acre.
('15', 52, 5, 9, 90221) There are two roomy houses with little plots of ground attached.
('15', 52, 5, 10, 90286) We are doing only a little vegetable gardening.
('15', 52, 5, 11, 90334) Water is drawn from two wells.
('15', 52, 5, 12, 90365) These are rustic wells, with primitive contrivances for drawing water.
('15', 52, 5, 13, 90436) The dispute was paltry, out of cussedness.
('15', 52, 5, 14, 90479) The man felt polluted because the boys fetched water from his side of the well.
('15', 52, 5, 15, 90559) It was no water dispute.
('15', 52, 6, 16, 90584) We are now weaving our own cloth, sewing things, too, ourselves.
('15', 52, 7, 17, 90649) The buildings were ready for our occupation.
('15', 52, 7, 18, 90694) They are hired houses.
('15', 52, 7, 19, 90717) We are not on our own ground yet.
('15', 52, 7, 20, 90751) Manilal has completed his weaving lessons.
('15', 52, 7, 21, 90794) He has now gone to a village to complete his course.
('15', 52, 7, 22, 90847) Maganlal too has nearly picked it up.
('15', 52, 7, 23, 90885) Devdas is becoming an expert tailor.
('15', 52, 7, 24, 90922) He is turning out a fine student.
('15', 52, 8, 25, 90956) But the life here owing to the untouchable problem has become most difficult for me.
('15', 52, 8, 26, 91041) Mrs. Gandhi is the cause.
('15', 52, 8, 27, 91067) And yet as I have told you I am internally at peace.
('15', 52, 8, 28, 91120) Now good bye.

('15', 53, 3, 4, 91385) MY DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('15', 53, 3, 5, 91421) Mrs. Gandhi has become a little better but before she could regain her sanity I had to undertake partial starvation.
('15', 53, 3, 6, 91538) I lived without nuts for a few days.
('15', 53, 3, 7, 91575) Just now we have about 40 guests.
('15', 53, 3, 8, 91609) Of these 37 are from an institution about 150 miles from here.
('15', 53, 3, 9, 91672) So we have been obliged for the last 4 days to cook for about 80 people.
('15', 53, 3, 10, 91745) Fortunately there are some fine workers and the guests themselves do their share of the work.
('15', 53, 3, 11, 91839) They assist in the kitchen, in water carrying and grinding.
('15', 53, 3, 12, 91899) Carpentry is going strong.
('15', 53, 3, 13, 91926) We are making sectional book cases.
('15', 53, 3, 14, 91962) I think I mentioned this to you.
('15', 53, 3, 15, 91995) Your books will be housed in one of them.
('15', 53, 3, 16, 92037) When you see these you will like them.
('15', 53, 3, 17, 92076) There will be five sections to each.
('15', 53, 3, 18, 92113) The cost will come to about 6 each.
('15', 53, 3, 19, 92149) Cheap enough you will say.
('15', 53, 3, 20, 92176) But according to the measure here 6 for a book case is rather a heavy charge.
('15', 53, 3, 21, 92254) I wish I could give you a sketch of the handlooms but I cannot.
('15', 53, 3, 22, 92318) It is an intricate affair.
('15', 53, 3, 23, 92345) You cannot have any notion from my description because I cannot give you a technical description.
('15', 53, 3, 24, 92443) Suffice it to say that it has as much string work as wood work.
('15', 53, 3, 25, 92507) The cost of the simplest loom is under 7. Maganlal is to leave for Madras in a day or two in order to finish his Tamil study and his handloom experience.
('15', 53, 3, 26, 92661) There is a big and rather good handloom business in Madras.
('15', 53, 3, 27, 92721) Did I tell you that we all remain in the house bare bodied?
('15', 53, 3, 28, 92781) All we wear is dhotar the cloth round the waist.
('15', 53, 3, 29, 92830) It is the sanest thing we could have done.
('15', 53, 3, 30, 92873) I receive visitors, both English and Indian, in that condition.
('15', 53, 3, 31, 92937) So you will see that the cost of clothing will be very little.
('15', 53, 3, 32, 93000) We shall confine ourselves to our own production.
('15', 53, 3, 33, 93050) And now good bye.
('15', 53, 3, 34, 93068) The bell has gone to serve the boys.
('15', 53, 3, 35, 93105) Do come soon and take your share in the serving.
('15', 53, 4, 36, 93154) Yours always, OLD FRIEND From the original: Gandhi Kallenbach Correspondence.

('15', 54, 1, 2, 93397) SPEECH ON INDENTURED INDIAN LABOUR AT BOMBAY 1
('15', 54, 2, 3, 93444) October 28, 1915
('15', 54, 3, 4, 93461) Mr. Gandhi, who was loudly cheered by the audience, said that the question of indentured labour was just now a topical question, because those true and real friends of India, Messrs Andrews and Pearson, were conducting an enquiry 2 in Fiji.
('15', 54, 3, 5, 93702) The Fiji Islands absorbed the largest number of indentured Indians at the present moment.
('15', 54, 3, 6, 93792) Messrs Andrews and Pearson were not the first to interest the Indians in this question, but it was the deceased statesman, Mr. Gokhale, who first impressed Indians with the importance of their duties in connection with this question.
('15', 54, 3, 7, 94026) Mr. Gandhi here read the resolution 3 introduced by Mr. Gokhale in the Viceregal Council and his speech 4 upon it demanding the total abolition of the indenture system and commented upon it at some length.
('15', 54, 3, 8, 94232) The resolution which Mr. Gokhale brought before the Council was defeated by a majority, though all 5 the non official members of the Council voted for the abolition.
('15', 54, 3, 9, 94398) However much a benign and sympathetic Viceroy wished to remove this abominable system of indenture from the Indian Statute Book, there was a very serious difficulty in his way and that was the report by the two Commissioners, who were sent by Lord Hardinge, namely, Messrs MacNeill and Chimanlal, 6 which was contained in two bulky volumes.
('15', 54, 3, 10, 94739) All might not care to wade through the rather dull pages of those volumes, but to him who knew what real indentured labour was they were of great interest.
('15', 54, 3, 11, 94895) They might, however, take upon trust that the report recognised that indentured labour should continue just as it was, if certain conditions were fulfilled.
('15', 54, 3, 12, 95052) Those conditions, Mr. Gandhi said, were impossible of fulfilment.
('15', 54, 3, 13, 95118) And the recommendations, which these two great Commissioners made, showed that they really could not seriously have meant that the system of indenture which existed today in Fiji, Jamaica, Guiana and other colonies should be continued a minute longer than was actually necessary.
('15', 54, 3, 14, 95398) The speaker here referred to the previous commission and said that the defects which Messrs MacNeill and Chimanlal had pointed out were patent to all.
('15', 54, 3, 15, 95549) Their report contained nothing new.
('15', 54, 3, 16, 95585) But there was unofficial investigation on behalf of some philanthropic body in England some forty years
('15', 54, 4, 17, 95689) 1 Under the auspices of the District Congress Committee at the Empire Theatre, Sir Ibrahim Rahimtullah presiding 2 The results were published in their Report on Indentured Labour in Fiji.

('15', 55, 0, 1, 96224) 56 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 55, 1, 2, 96265) ago, and in that book an unvarnished tale was given, which told in graphic language what were the hardships under the system.
('15', 55, 2, 3, 96391) In this connection, Mr. Gandhi quoted a statement made by the Prime Minister of Natal in which he said that the system of indenture was a most inadvisable thing and that the sooner it was terminated, the better for the indentured labourer and the employer.
('15', 55, 2, 4, 96648) Lord Selborne said the same thing when he was the High Commissioner in South Africa: he said that it was worse for the employer than the employed, because it was a system perilously near to slavery.
('15', 55, 2, 5, 96847) Sir William Hunter 1 wrote a beautiful series of letters in 1895 when he first brought himself to study the system personally and compared the system of indenture, after due investigation, to a state bordering on slavery.
('15', 55, 2, 6, 97069) On one occasion he used the expression semi slavery.
('15', 55, 2, 7, 97122) Mr. Gandhi said if he erred in making these statements, he erred in Lord Selbornes company.
('15', 55, 2, 8, 97214) And it was in connection with this system that these two worthy gentlemen, the Commissioners, had seen fit to report and advise the fulfilment of certain conditions which in the very nature of the contract were impossible of fulfilment.
('15', 55, 2, 9, 97451) The conditions were that unsuitable emigrants be excluded; the proportion of females to males to be raised from 40 to 50 per cent.
('15', 55, 2, 10, 97582) The speaker could not understand what they meant by unsuitable emigrants being excluded.
('15', 55, 2, 11, 97671) The Commissioners themselves told them that it was not easy to find labour in India.
('15', 55, 2, 12, 97756) India was not pining to send her children out as semi slaves.
('15', 55, 2, 13, 97818) Lord Sanderson 2 stated that it was the surplus population from India that went out from dissatisfaction with the economic condition in India.
('15', 55, 2, 14, 97961) But they must remember that there were 500 recruiting licences issued in the year 1907. Could they conceive the significance of the extraordinary state of things which required one recruiter to 17 labourers?
('15', 55, 2, 15, 98169) The Colonial Governments had their sub agents in India for this indentured labour to be collected.
('15', 55, 2, 16, 98268) They were paid a sum of Rs. 25 for each cooly recruited, and this sum of Rs. 25 was divided between the recruiter and the sub agent.
('15', 55, 2, 17, 98401) Mr. Gandhi thought the mental state of those recruiters must be miserable, who could send so many of their countrymen as semi slaves.
('15', 55, 2, 18, 98535) After having seen what the recruiting agents did and after having read the many gross mis statements they made, he was not surprised that thousands and thousands of their countrymen were becoming indentured labourers.
('15', 55, 2, 19, 98753) The Commissioners devoted several pages to the immorality prevailing on the estates.
('15', 55, 2, 20, 98838) It was not forty women for sixty men, but the statement was made that these men did not marry these women, but kept them and that
('15', 55, 3, 21, 98968) 1 (1840 1900), historian, an authority on Indian affairs and author of Indian Empire; served in India for 25 years, was sympathetic to lndian aspirations; member of the British Committee of the Indian National Congress in London 2 Chairman of the Committee appointed by the British Government in England to investigate conditions in the Crown Colonies of Jamaica, Trinidad, British Guiana and Fiji.
('15', 56, 0, 1, 99367) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 57
('15', 56, 1, 2, 99408) many of these women were prostitutes.
('15', 56, 1, 3, 99446) Mr. Gandhi said he would decline to send his children out of the country under such an indenture, if he was worthy of his salt.
('15', 56, 1, 4, 99574) But thousands of men and women had gone.
('15', 56, 1, 5, 99615) What did they think of that in India?
('15', 56, 2, 6, 99653) The conditions were that rigorous provisions should be either expunged from the Ordinances and that the Protector should control employers.
('15', 56, 2, 7, 99793) As for the regulations made to protect these labourers, they could take it from him, Mr. Gandhi said, that there were a great many flaws in them and a coach and four could be easily driven through these.
('15', 56, 2, 8, 99997) The aim of the rules was to make the employer supreme.
('15', 56, 2, 9, 100052) Here was capital ranged against labour with artificial prop for capital and not labour.
('15', 56, 3, 10, 100140) Mr. Gandhi condemned the protectors of emigrants.
('15', 56, 3, 11, 100190) They were men belonging to that very class to which employers belonged; they moved among them and was it not only natural that they should have their sympathies on the side of the employers?
('15', 56, 3, 12, 100381) How was it then possible that they could do justice to the labourer against the employer?
('15', 56, 3, 13, 100471) He knew many instances when magistrates had meted out justice to the indentured labourer, but it was impossible to expect such a thing from the Protectors of Emigrants.
('15', 56, 3, 14, 100640) The labourer was bound hand and foot to the employer.
('15', 56, 3, 15, 100694) If he committed an offence against his employer, he first of all had to undergo a course of imprisonment; then the days that the labourer had spent in the jail were added to his indenture and he was taken back to his master to serve again.
('15', 56, 3, 16, 100934) The Commissioners had nothing to say against these rules.
('15', 56, 3, 17, 100992) There was nobody to judge the Protector of Emigrants if he gave a wrong judgment, but in the case of the magistrate he could be criticised.
('15', 56, 3, 18, 101132) Again, the Commissioners said that these prisoners should be put into separate jails.
('15', 56, 3, 19, 101218) But the Colonial Government would be bankrupt if they built jails for hundreds of prisoners that were imprisoned.
('15', 56, 3, 20, 101332) They were not able to build jails for the passive resisters.
('15', 56, 3, 21, 101393) Then the Commissioners said that the labourer should be allowed to redeem his indenture by payment of a graduated redemption fee.
('15', 56, 3, 22, 101523) They made a mistake in thinking him to be an independent man.
('15', 56, 3, 23, 101585) He was not his own master.
('15', 56, 3, 24, 101612) Mr. Gandhi said he had known of English girls, well educated, who were decoyed, and who were not indentured, unable to free themselves.
('15', 56, 3, 25, 101748) How was it then possible for an indentured labourer to do this?
('15', 56, 3, 26, 101812) Then the Commissioners said the special needs of Indian children in the matter of primary education should receive consideration.
('15', 56, 3, 27, 101942) As for education, Mr. Gandhi said, no doubt, some work of that kind was being done by some of the philanthropic missions, but nothing substantial was being done or could be expected.
('15', 56, 3, 28, 102125) Mr. Balfour 1 compared the labourer under an indenture to a soldier.
('15', 56, 3, 29, 102194) But the soldier was a responsible man and he could rise to a high position.
('15', 56, 3, 30, 102270) But an indentured labourer remained a labourer.
('15', 56, 3, 31, 102318) He had no privileges.
('15', 56, 3, 32, 102340) His wife was also included under his disabilities, so also his son.
('15', 56, 3, 33, 102408) In Natal the finger of scorn was pointed at these

('15', 57, 1, 2, 102593) people.
('15', 57, 1, 3, 102601) Never could an indentured Indian rise to a higher post than that of labourer.
('15', 57, 1, 4, 102679) And what did the labourer bring when he returned to India?
('15', 57, 1, 5, 102738) He returned a broken vessel, with some of the artificial and superficial signs of civilization, but he left more valuable things behind him.
('15', 57, 1, 6, 102879) He might bring some sovereigns also with him.
('15', 57, 1, 7, 102925) They should decline to perpetuate this hateful system of indenture because it robbed them of their national self respect.
('15', 57, 2, 8, 103047) If they could consider well over what he had said, they would try and abolish the system in a years time and this one taint upon the nation would have gone and indentured labour would be a thing of the past.
('15', 57, 2, 9, 103255) He wanted to remove thecause of the ill treatment of Indians in the Colonies.
('15', 57, 2, 10, 103333) However protected that system might be, it still remained a state bordering upon slavery.
('15', 57, 2, 11, 103423) It would remain, said Mr. Gandhi, a state based upon full fledged slavery and it was a hindrance to national growth and national dignity.

('15', 58, 8, 19, 105630) MY DEAR FRIEND,
('15', 58, 9, 20, 105646) Not a week just now passes but has its surprises for me.
('15', 58, 9, 21, 105703) Chhaganlal seems to be dangerously ill.
('15', 58, 9, 22, 105743) He has been persistently coughing blood and says he is going down.
('15', 58, 9, 23, 105810) He eats little.
('15', 58, 9, 24, 105826) I had to telegraph saying he should be sent if still ill.
('15', 58, 9, 25, 105884) Things at Phoenix are not moving well otherwise.
('15', 58, 9, 26, 105933) Pragji has not much heart in the work.
('15', 58, 9, 27, 105972) I do not know that I can spare anybody from here.
('15', 58, 9, 28, 106022) Maganlal went on Thursday to Madras with his wife and the two daughters.
('15', 58, 9, 29, 106095) Fakiri and another have joined him.
('15', 58, 9, 30, 106131) Maganlal is to finish his Tamil course and handloom work.
('15', 58, 9, 31, 106189) So he can be ill spared just now.
('15', 58, 9, 32, 106223) Mrs. Gandhi continues to cause trouble.
('15', 58, 9, 33, 106263) So you see my difficulties are fairly thick.
('15', 58, 9, 34, 106308) They give me food for thought but no anxiety.
('15', 58, 9, 35, 106354) I know that I can but do little.
('15', 58, 9, 36, 106387) You are afraid of the increasing intensity of life here.

('15', 59, 6, 8, 106906) AHMEDABAD, October 31 [1915] 1
('15', 59, 7, 9, 106937) MY DEAR WEST, I have your indictment.
('15', 59, 7, 10, 106975) If you do not speak out, who would?
('15', 59, 7, 11, 107011) I value your friendship just because you always say exactly what you mean.
('15', 59, 7, 12, 107086) Now for the reply.
('15', 59, 7, 13, 107105) I could not consult anyone there as to allocations because I was not there.
('15', 59, 7, 14, 107181) The Phoenix allocations were discussed between us there.
('15', 59, 7, 15, 107238) Relief allocations needed no discussion.
('15', 59, 7, 16, 107279) Valiama Hall allocation was settled there.
('15', 59, 7, 17, 107322) The 1,000 for Polaks expenses, should he have to return to England penniless, was a matter which was fixed there but I am not able to say that it was positively discussed.
('15', 59, 7, 18, 107494) But I suggest that it is again an expense about which I should not deem consultation necessary.
('15', 59, 7, 19, 107590) If the community has any respect for itself, it could not send them away starving.
('15', 59, 7, 20, 107673) It would be pure passive resistance relief.
('15', 59, 7, 21, 107717) I would not dream about publishing it in the accounts sheet.
('15', 59, 7, 22, 107778) We are not bound to disclose the names of the resisters helped.
('15', 59, 7, 23, 107842) Mr. Petits statement was published after consultation with me.
('15', 59, 7, 24, 107905) Mine was delayed at his instance.
('15', 59, 7, 25, 107939) I have brought every item; including Polaks 1,000 to the Committees notice.
('15', 59, 7, 26, 108015) I am even going to bring to Mr. Petits notice your and Rustomjis dissent.
('15', 59, 7, 27, 108089) You suggest that you could not take interest which is tainted nor would you take the help offered.
('15', 59, 7, 28, 108188) I congratulate you.
('15', 59, 7, 29, 108208) The strongeryou are, the better.
('15', 59, 7, 30, 108241) The allocations suggested by me were due to our collective weakness.
('15', 59, 7, 31, 108310) But you will not find me weakening you if you

('15', 60, 0, 1, 108491) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 61
('15', 60, 1, 2, 108532) are strong.
('15', 60, 1, 3, 108544) You suggest that for Phoenixs improvement, I would have to send you money from elsewhere.
('15', 60, 1, 4, 108634) This I could not do.
('15', 60, 1, 5, 108655) Even when we discussed there, it was clearly understood that the charges should come out of the passive resistance funds, as we were running Phoenix as a P. R. farm and wanted to make it more and more a refuge for indentured Indians who may be in distress.
('15', 60, 1, 6, 108912) If therefore you want the help, it can only come out of the fund.
('15', 60, 1, 7, 108978) I would certainly welcome any decision you may come to as to not receiving any help.
('15', 60, 1, 8, 109063) The money does not belong to South Africa.
('15', 60, 1, 9, 109106) The Committee here has control over it.
('15', 60, 1, 10, 109146) They asked that the funds be transferred to them, subject to such allocations as I may suggest.
('15', 60, 1, 11, 109242) I am now having no definite allocations but shall receive monies for you in S.A. as you there may desire from time to time.
('15', 60, 1, 12, 109366) This gives the Committee here the fullest control.
('15', 60, 1, 13, 109417) I shall act as the go between.
('15', 60, 1, 14, 109448) As to books, you are quite wrong.
('15', 60, 1, 15, 109482) Our books contain all the receipts and all disbursements.
('15', 60, 1, 16, 109540) We need no audit, we owe nobody anything and no one has a legal right to ask us to do anything except the Committee.
('15', 60, 1, 17, 109657) Individual subscribers may ask.
('15', 60, 1, 18, 109689) Them we could satisfy.
('15', 60, 1, 19, 109712) Not a penny has been yet spent which could not be brought within the scope of the fund.
('15', 60, 1, 20, 109800) Relief to resisters includes Polak, Thambi and even Mr. Cachalia.
('15', 60, 1, 21, 109866) I do not think we have received the loan given to him.
('15', 60, 1, 22, 109921) So will it include Chhaganlal, Maganlal, Pragji, etc.
('15', 60, 1, 23, 109975) It will most decidedly include Naidoos and other passive resisters children.
('15', 60, 1, 24, 110052) It will not include me and my family simply because our expenses are found otherwise.
('15', 60, 1, 25, 110138) As I am or rather have been the controller of the funds, I have desired to remain free from personal help.
('15', 60, 1, 26, 110245) But if I had no one else to help me, I should not hesitate to draw for self and children.
('15', 60, 1, 27, 110335) Only then I would at least make that clear to the public.
('15', 60, 1, 28, 110393) No such precaution is necessary regarding other passive resisters as I cover them.
('15', 60, 1, 29, 110476) I need not discuss your proposal to invest in land, as we no longer have the funds under our control.
('15', 60, 1, 30, 110578) I have cabled 1 you regarding Chhaganlal.
('15', 60, 1, 31, 110620) He seems to be breaking up.
('15', 60, 1, 32, 110648) If so, he should be sent here.

('15', 61, 1, 5, 111089) I think I have now exhausted all the material points raised by you.
('15', 61, 1, 6, 111157) I mean material in view of the new state of things.
('15', 61, 1, 7, 111209) Now you may all consider and let me know your decision.
('15', 61, 1, 8, 111265) I have P. R. a/c to 31st Jan.

('15', 61, 6, 15, 111613) Chhaganlal might be sent here if he was still ill.
('15', 61, 6, 16, 111664) Khushalbhai was very pleased.
('15', 61, 6, 17, 111694) The reply came Chhaganlal better, West. I can see from this that he is not likely to come in the near future.
('15', 61, 6, 18, 111804) I am writing all the same that, if they can spare Chhaganlal, he may come away.
('15', 61, 6, 19, 111884) The printing of the satyagraha account is nearly over.
('15', 61, 6, 20, 111939) Keshu is enjoying himself.
('15', 61, 6, 21, 111966) He had slight fever for a day.
('15', 61, 6, 22, 111997) All the children sleep by my side.
('15', 61, 6, 23, 112032) I take their lessons and that is a great advantage.
('15', 61, 6, 24, 112084) I take all the lessons of Naransami and Parthasarathi with the exception of Sanskrit, and I intend to continue doing so for the present.
('15', 61, 6, 25, 112221) Ba has calmed down a little.

('15', 62, 5, 6, 112836) MY DEAR WEST, I forgot to mention that Valiama Hall had to go.
('15', 62, 5, 7, 112899) I saw that the Committee 2 do not like the idea.
('15', 62, 5, 8, 112948) It would have sanctioned it if I had insisted, but I did not especially in view of the condition of the community there.
('15', 62, 5, 9, 113069) I have your wire about Chhaganlal.
('15', 62, 5, 10, 113104) 3 Letters recently received from Chhaganlal have been alarming.
('15', 62, 5, 11, 113168) And I felt that if he was not keeping well, it was better to send him here.
('15', 62, 5, 12, 113244) The latest from him says that even if he was well, he could not only be spared but that his retirement would cause relief.
('15', 62, 5, 13, 113367) If he can be spared, he may be sent.
('15', 62, 5, 14, 113404) If you need [an] assistant from here, I would send after 3 months or thereabout.
('15', 62, 5, 15, 113485) I cabled 4 too saying that audit was unnecessary.
('15', 62, 5, 16, 113535) You could gain nothing by auditing especially now.
('15', 62, 5, 17, 113586) If we decide not to take any public funds, our books can be only simple.
('15', 62, 5, 18, 113659) All you will then have will be receipts from Indian Opinion and book sales and expenditure.
('15', 62, 5, 19, 113751) What is left for Polak is earmarked.
('15', 62, 5, 20, 113788) If you would not handle it there, it now could be transferred here.
('15', 62, 5, 21, 113856) But I hope that you will all consider that allotment to be necessary.
('15', 62, 5, 22, 113926) Valiama Hall ground may be kept or it may be sold and the proceeds returned here.
('15', 62, 5, 23, 114008) Maganlal has gone to Madras to finish his Tamil studies.

('15', 65, 2, 3, 117254) November 15, 1915
('15', 65, 3, 4, 117272) The entrusting of this resolution to me has given me a welcome opportunity to express my sentiments about Sir Pherozeshah in public.
('15', 65, 3, 5, 117405) He was the lion of the Bombay Municipal Corporation and I too have sometimes heard the roaring of this lion.
('15', 65, 3, 6, 117514) Many were the battles he fought with Sir George Clarke 2, Lord Harris 3, successive Viceroys and many Governors in India.
('15', 65, 3, 7, 117636) No wonder that the whole of India mourns the death of such a valiant leader.
('15', 65, 3, 8, 117713) But there is selfishness behind this expression of grief.
('15', 65, 3, 9, 117771) If many more among us could live and die as he lived and died we would in that case have nothing to grieve for.
('15', 65, 3, 10, 117883) A little while ago, India was lamenting the death of the Honble Mr. Gokhale.
('15', 65, 3, 11, 117960) Before these tears had dried, we have had another stunning blow.
('15', 65, 3, 12, 118025) It would not be fair to compare these two great men.
('15', 65, 3, 13, 118078) They did their best, each according to his lights.
('15', 65, 3, 14, 118129) Mr. Gokhale was a selfless man and as such deserved the title of rishi.
('15', 65, 3, 15, 118201) There are two epithets which describe Sir Pherozeshah.
('15', 65, 3, 16, 118256) In the first place, he was the Father of the Bombay Municipal Corporation and, in the second, he was the uncrowned king of Bombay, say rather, of the whole of Indiaa king chosen by the subjects themselves.
('15', 65, 3, 17, 118462) He took the lead on every public issue and the people had come to have such confidence in him that they would do whatever he wanted them to do.
('15', 65, 3, 18, 118606) That was because of the respect that people, not only of Bombay city but of the whole Presidency, had for his judgment.
('15', 65, 3, 19, 118726) There was none to challenge his position in the Presidency.
('15', 65, 3, 20, 118786) At a time when the people of India expect to win important political rights, no one is left, we may say, who could speak to the Government on our behalf.
('15', 65, 3, 21, 118940) I have read somewhere that those who love their friends dearly love them all the more in their death; likewise, if we are overflowing with love at this moment, it is because of the great qualities of Sir Pherozeshah.
('15', 65, 3, 22, 119157) We may have crossed him often enough when he was alive, spoken well or
('15', 65, 4, 23, 119228) 1 Held in Premabhai Hall, Sir Chinubhai presiding; Gandhiji proposed the condolence resolution.

('15', 66, 1, 2, 119540) ill of him; but, now that he has gone, we are not to look at his faults.
('15', 66, 1, 3, 119613) It is but our duty that we should hold a condolence meeting on his death.
('15', 66, 1, 4, 119687) We must not, however, stop with this.
('15', 66, 1, 5, 119725) It was Sir Pherozeshahs desire that we, too, all of us, should render public service as he did and we shall have done our duty to him only if we render such service.
('15', 66, 1, 6, 119891) His body, which was mortal, has perished but what he did will live on.
('15', 66, 1, 7, 119962) His interest in public service was so keen that he would get his clients cases adjourned or let go his fees, suffer all manner of inconvenience even to attend meetings of the Bombay Municipal Corporation.
('15', 66, 1, 8, 120167) He would sometimes not go to the Assembly; he considered the work of the Corporation of greater importance.
('15', 66, 1, 9, 120275) He did not like being absorbed exclusively in political activities.
('15', 66, 1, 10, 120343) It was his principle that whatever one took up, one must carry to success and he, therefore, gave his best attention to the work of the Bombay Corporation.
('15', 66, 1, 11, 120499) There is no city in India in which a member has rendered such services in the field of municipal work as Sir Pherozeshah has done.
('15', 66, 1, 12, 120630) The world has admired the services of Mr. Chamberlain 1 as President of Birmingham Municipality, but Sir Pherozeshah did, single handed, work for Bombay which it would have taken four Chamberlains to do.
('15', 66, 1, 13, 120834) The right memorial to Sir Pherozeshah would be for all municipalities to work in the manner he did.
('15', 66, 1, 14, 120934) The daily political discussions in Sir Pherozeshahs office were unfailingly echoed immediately in the public at large, so important and influential were his views.
('15', 66, 1, 15, 121098) He was more of an Indian than a Parsi and believed that the unity of India could be achieved only by turning the entire population into a single community.
('15', 66, 1, 16, 121254) The discussions in his office were mainly concerned with how we could fight fearlessly for our rights.
('15', 66, 1, 17, 121357) He had to suffer much while doing public service.
('15', 66, 1, 18, 121407) He once gave me the best advice on this subject.
('15', 66, 1, 19, 121456) I was insulted by an Englishman once and I was about to file a suit for damages against him.
('15', 66, 1, 20, 121549) Sir Pherozeshah told me then that, if I wished to do any good to myself or the country, I should swallow the insult and that I should swallow similar insults in future as well.
('15', 66, 1, 21, 121726) Indeed, I have had to swallow them on numerous occasions.
('15', 66, 1, 22, 121784) I must admit that whatever capacity for work I possess I owe to this advice.
('15', 66, 1, 23, 121861) If we pay tributes to him today, it is because of his good sense, his courage and faith.
('15', 66, 1, 24, 121950) I feel like making a suggestion about how we may perpetuate the memory of this great man whom Ahmedabad mourns today.
('15', 66, 1, 25, 122068) This public hall is so small that the city should be ashamed of

('15', 67, 1, 3, 122266) It is my submission, therefore, that the people of Ahmedabad should build a big public hall in memory of Sir Pherozeshah Mehta.
('15', 67, 1, 4, 122394) His magnificence, too, deserves to be understood.
('15', 67, 1, 5, 122444) He was lavish in spending money.
('15', 67, 1, 6, 122477) Mr. Gokhale, Mr. Ishvar Chandra Vidyasagar 1 and others held one view about how one should live and Pherozeshah held another, which, however, did no harm.
('15', 67, 1, 7, 122632) Ahmedabad ought to put up a memorial to so great a man and I hope my appeal will find favour with the people of Ahmedabad.

('15', 68, 2, 3, 124034) November 21,1915
('15', 68, 3, 4, 124051) At a public meeting held at the Premabhai Hall, Ahmedabad, on November 21, 1915, to celebrate the birthday of the famous philosopher of Gujarat, Shrimad Rajchandra 1, Gandhiji, who occupied the chair, dwelt in the course of his opening remarks on the appropriateness of the celebration of the great philosophers birthday.
('15', 68, 4, 5, 124373) Dealing with the life of Rajchandra, Mr. Gandhi mentioned that he had come in close personal contact with him and, so far as he was competent to judge, he declared it to be his deliberate opinion that the deceased was one of the best religious philosophers of modern times in India.
('15', 68, 4, 6, 124656) He was incomparable in true perception, he was free from attachment, and had true vairagya in him.
('15', 68, 4, 7, 124755) 2 He followed no narrow creed.
('15', 68, 5, 8, 124786) He was a universalist and had no quarrel with any religion in the world.
('15', 68, 5, 9, 124859) In the West, the speaker had found Tolstoy and Ruskin among the best philosophers and he did not hesitate to put the deceased above both of them.
('15', 68, 5, 10, 125005) The deceased outdid them in religious experience.
('15', 68, 5, 11, 125055) The faith of the deceased was a robust faith, such as could only be based upon the true realisation of the self.
('15', 68, 5, 12, 125168) Upon the speakers own life, the deceased had exercised a very powerful influence.
('15', 68, 5, 13, 125250) There was a suitable and certain sublimity and genuineness about the writings of the deceased, which gave them peculiar charm and enabled them to have a powerful hold upon the reader.
('15', 68, 6, 14, 125434) Concluding, Mr. Gandhi hoped that those who had attended the celebration would take the trouble of studying the writings of the deceased Mahatma and he promised that they would feel all the better for their trouble.

('15', 69, 3, 4, 126274) The Ashram activities are in full swing.
('15', 69, 3, 5, 126315) It has at present 33 inmates in all, three of whom are Dheds.
('15', 69, 3, 6, 126377) These latter have become a serious issue.
('15', 69, 3, 7, 126419) Ahmedabad is considered to be a stronghold of sanatana dharma 2. Hence the issue of the Dheds has led to a storm.
('15', 69, 3, 8, 126533) At first we thought the entire Ashram would be outcast, and that may yet happen.
('15', 69, 3, 9, 126614) The boys have made much progress in their study of Sanskrit, Hindi and Tamil.
('15', 69, 3, 10, 126692) They are being taught carpentry and hand weaving.
('15', 69, 3, 11, 126742) Two carpenters are engaged in the Ashram.
('15', 69, 3, 12, 126784) In a few days, we shall send you some cloth woven on looms by our own hands.
('15', 69, 3, 13, 126861) The boys have made tables, etc.
('15', 69, 3, 14, 126893) They are now working at book cases for holding books.

('15', 69, 9, 20, 127070) MY DEAR FRIEND,
('15', 69, 10, 21, 127086) You have asked me to tell you more about Andrews and Pearson than I have done.
('15', 69, 10, 22, 127165) I came in very close touch with both of them in Santiniketan.
('15', 69, 10, 23, 127227) We came nearer one another than we ever were.
('15', 69, 10, 24, 127273) They are both now in Fiji investigating the indenture question.
('15', 69, 10, 25, 127337) Before going, they passed some time here.
('15', 69, 10, 26, 127379) They were quite happy.
('15', 69, 10, 27, 127402) They are to be back in two months time.
('15', 69, 10, 28, 127442) Pearson is a full fledged teacher at Santiniketan.
('15', 69, 10, 29, 127493) Andrews is the Poets mentor.
('15', 69, 10, 30, 127522) He takes no part in

('15', 70, 1, 2, 127879) teaching.
('15', 70, 1, 3, 127889) Andrews was at deaths door recently having had a severe attack of cholera.
('15', 70, 1, 4, 127964) He was better when he left.
('15', 70, 2, 5, 127992) Maganlal was upon his trial when the Pariah was admitted.
('15', 70, 2, 6, 128050) He stood it well.
('15', 70, 2, 7, 128068) He remains as much attached to the Ashram as ever.
('15', 70, 2, 8, 128119) But what I said in my letter holds good.
('15', 70, 2, 9, 128160) My soul may take me anywhere any day and I may find myself without the staunchest of my co workers at that time.
('15', 70, 2, 10, 128273) It will certainly be no fault of theirs.
('15', 70, 2, 11, 128314) I cannot expect them to understand or follow me in all my flights.
('15', 70, 3, 12, 128381) Mrs. Gandhi still remains disturbed.
('15', 70, 3, 13, 128418) She does not want to live away from me.
('15', 70, 3, 14, 128458) If she could overcome the strong desire to live with me, she would have left me long ago.
('15', 70, 4, 15, 128548) Jeki had a son born to her in Fiji.
('15', 70, 4, 16, 128584) She is now in Rangoon.
('15', 70, 4, 17, 128607) I have not met her.
('15', 70, 4, 18, 128627) Dr. Mehta was here the other day.
('15', 70, 4, 19, 128661) He told me she was well.
('15', 70, 5, 20, 128686) Indian Opinion has been reduced in size.
('15', 70, 5, 21, 128727) The price too has been reduced.
('15', 70, 5, 22, 128759) It is 1d.
('15', 70, 5, 23, 128769) Ritch has returned to South Africa.
('15', 70, 6, 24, 128805) This finishes the budget of news.
('15', 70, 7, 25, 128839) You say you have not influenced your surroundings, if anything you have been influenced by them.
('15', 70, 7, 26, 128936) I do not gather it from your letters.
('15', 70, 7, 27, 128974) In any event one certainly cannot be too much on ones guard.
('15', 70, 7, 28, 129035) True worth of a man seems to me to consist in his capacity to resist his surroundings.
('15', 70, 7, 29, 129122) It is the measure of his self realization.
('15', 70, 7, 30, 129165) If we control ourselves we cannot be controlled by others, not even by our surroundings, not fashion, nor food, nor spectacles, nor games, nor company, nor hobbies.
('15', 70, 7, 31, 129330) There is no true happiness without this real self rule.
('15', 70, 7, 32, 129386) You have a unique opportunity of acquiring it.
('15', 70, 7, 33, 129433) May it be your lot to do so.
('15', 70, 8, 34, 129462) With love,

('15', 71, 2, 3, 129650) November 28, 1915
('15', 71, 3, 4, 129668) I know that you will dislike my expressing, amidst all this gaiety, views which you will find unpleasant; I must, all the same, tell you what I feel.
('15', 71, 3, 5, 129818) It may, of course, be questioned whether, holding the views that I do, I should have come to a gathering such as this; it is still more open to question whether I should express them.
('15', 71, 3, 6, 130002) It is love which prompted me to come here and, again, it is love which has prompted me to stand up and speak.
('15', 71, 3, 7, 130112) You are all very happy and I too am happy to see you honour Bhai Nanalal.
('15', 71, 3, 8, 130186) He has succeeded in gaining admission into the Indian Civil Service.
('15', 71, 3, 9, 130255) 2 He deserves to be honoured for his hard work.
('15', 71, 3, 10, 130303) 3 But I should not like other students to follow his example and enter the civil service.
('15', 71, 3, 11, 130393) Our students do not need at present the kind of example Civilians provide; they stand in need of the example set by the lives of Mr. Dadabhai, Mr. Gokhale and Mr. Pherozeshah Mehta.
('15', 71, 3, 12, 130575) If I may use the words of the late Mr. Gokhale, what we need at present is characters not labels.
('15', 71, 3, 13, 130673) Bhai Nanalals father spent Rs. 30,000 to make him a Civilian; I believe he could have put that money to better use instead; and Bhai Nanalal, even if he had remained an ordinary man, could have rendered better service to India in some other capacity, if he had so chosen.
('15', 71, 3, 14, 130945) Civilians have to come to India in plenty, and many more will come; but it doesnt look as if they have been particularly useful to the country.
('15', 71, 3, 15, 131089) Bhoja Bhagat 4 was a cobbler but, working as a cobbler, he succeeded in raising himself; and so also Akha Bhagat 5, who was a goldsmith.
('15', 71, 3, 16, 131226) Thus, if one wishes, one can progress spiritually even while pursuing ones vocation.
('15', 71, 3, 17, 131311) And so also Bhai Nanalal could have been more useful to the country if he had devoted himself to its service while pursuing some vocation.
('15', 71, 3, 18, 131450) You are in love with labels and you think that it is something to have acquired one.
('15', 71, 3, 19, 131535) On the contrary, as I believe, the man is crushed beneath them, loses his truth.
('15', 71, 4, 20, 131616) 1 In honour of N. C. Mehta, who had been admitted to the Indian Civil Service 2 The source is damaged here.

('15', 72, 1, 2, 131891) We have no need at present of labels like B.A., M.A., Baronet, K.C.S.I., C.I.E., Sir, the Honble, etc.
('15', 72, 1, 3, 131994) We need men who will rise above the desire for all such honours and work.
('15', 72, 1, 4, 132068) People need education which will enable everyone to express his thoughts with the utmost freedom.
('15', 72, 1, 5, 132166) Today, all over the country there is an atmosphere of fear, so much so that we feel afraid, unnecessarily, even to express our views.
('15', 72, 1, 6, 132300) We need an education that will blow up all such notions and make us truly fearless.
('15', 72, 1, 7, 132384) We dont need labels.
('15', 72, 1, 8, 132405) I know many of you will not like this discordant note.
('15', 72, 1, 9, 132460) But, whispering into my ear a little while ago, Bhai Nanalal asked me why the people in India are so much impressed by success at examinations.
('15', 72, 1, 10, 132604) He said he could speak nothing of this but asked me if I wouldnt like to say something.
('15', 72, 1, 11, 132692) It is this hint from him which prompted me to say a few things which I had in mind.
('15', 72, 1, 12, 132776) You may accept what appeals to you and throw away or leave behind in this hall what may seem rubbish to you.
('15', 72, 1, 13, 132885) I wouldnt mind it either way.
('15', 72, 1, 14, 132915) I wish Bhai Nanalal all success in doing his duty, that is, in loyally serving theGovernment and comporting himself with the people, over whom he will be placed in authority, not as their superior but as one of them; for he should know that the people are not the slaves of the officers, it is the officers who are their servants.
('15', 72, 1, 15, 133246) May God give Bhai Nanalal long life and may he fulfil all our dreams about his serving the country.
('15', 72, 1, 16, 133346) If he does, I should be happy.
('15', 72, 1, 17, 133377) If things do not turn out so and he goes the way others do, I wish that he then performs prayashchita 1 and, should I come to hear of it all, I too would do prayashchita for having attended this function and addressed it.
('15', 72, 1, 18, 133599) It is not enough merely to acquire a means to a good income; there is much else one has to do afterwards and we need at present the character, the education and the men that will teach us how to do this.

('15', 73, 2, 3, 133931) SATYAGRAHA ASHRAM,
('15', 73, 3, 4, 133950) AHMEDABAD, Girmit 2 is a corrupt form of the English word agreement.
('15', 73, 3, 5, 134019) The term cannot be dispensed with.
('15', 73, 3, 6, 134054) What it suggests, agreement does not.
('15', 73, 3, 7, 134092) There is no alternative word in the language.
('15', 73, 3, 8, 134138) The document under which thousands of labourers used to emigrate and still emigrate to Natal and other countries on contract for five years is known by the labourers and the employers as girmit.
('15', 73, 3, 9, 134333) A labourer so emigrating under girmit is a girmitio 3. About 12,000 such indentured labourers emigrate annually from India, mostly to the Fiji Islands near Australia, Jamaica near South America, British Guiana, Dutch Guiana and Trinidad.
('15', 73, 3, 10, 134571) The late Mr. Gokhale, a brave soul, held indenture to be a state bordering on slavery; it was described in the same terms by the famous historian, the late Sir William Wilson Hunter; the same analogy was used by Mr. Harry Escombe, a well known former Minister of Natal.
('15', 73, 3, 11, 134841) Indenture is indeed a state of semi slavery.
('15', 73, 3, 12, 134886) Like the slave before him, the indentured labourer cannot buy his freedom.
('15', 73, 3, 13, 134961) A slavewas punished for not working; so also is an indentured labourer.
('15', 73, 3, 14, 135033) If he is negligent, does not attend work for a day, if he answers back,he will suffer imprisonment for any one of these lapses.
('15', 73, 3, 15, 135161) A slave could be sold and handed over by one owner to another, so too the indentured labourer can be transferred from one employer to another.
('15', 73, 3, 16, 135304) The children of a slave inherited the taint of slavery; much in the same way, the children of an indentured labourer are subject to laws specially passed for them.
('15', 73, 3, 17, 135468) The only difference between the two states is that while slavery ended only with life, an indentured labourer can be free after a certain number of years.
('15', 73, 3, 18, 135623) It should be noted, moreover, that indenture came after the abolition of slavery and that indentured labourers were recruited to take the place of slaves.

('15', 74, 1, 3, 135973) In the countries to which they emigrate, they receive no moral or religious education.
('15', 74, 1, 4, 136060) Most of them are unmarried.
('15', 74, 1, 5, 136088) On every ship carrying indentured labourers, there is provision for taking women to the extent of 40 per cent.
('15', 74, 1, 6, 136199) Some of these are women of ill fame.
('15', 74, 1, 7, 136236) They do not, as a rule, enter into a marriage alliance.
('15', 74, 1, 8, 136292) In this state of affairs, even if 20 per cent of the men wish to marry, they cannot.
('15', 74, 1, 9, 136377) Going to lands so far away, they get into the habit of drinking.
('15', 74, 1, 10, 136442) Women, who in India would never touch wine, are sometimes found lying dead drunk on the roads.
('15', 74, 2, 11, 136537) After all this degradation, the profit which they point to is that the economic condition of these people improves.
('15', 74, 2, 12, 136653) Everyone will admit that even though we may stand to gain economically by selling our souls, we ought not to do so.
('15', 74, 3, 13, 136769) How is it that this thing has been allowed to go on for fifty years now?
('15', 74, 3, 14, 136842) None of us will be prepared to submit himself to a condition such as this.
('15', 74, 3, 15, 136917) How then did we tolerate it for our own brethren?
('15', 74, 3, 16, 136967) In raising this question, I have not the least desire to make people feel sorry for the past, but the question helps us to realize our duty in the present.
('15', 74, 3, 17, 137123) The late Mr. Gokhale introduced, in March 1912, a resolution in the Imperial Legislative Council, asking for the repeal of the law governing indenture and demanding that the emigration of indentured labourers from India be stopped.
('15', 74, 3, 18, 137355) At that time, 22 members took a pledge that they would bring forward the resolution every year till indenture was abolished.
('15', 74, 3, 19, 137480) It is for us, the survivors, to fulfil that pledge.
('15', 74, 3, 20, 137532) Mr. Andrews and Mr. Pearson have gone to Fiji for this very purpose.
('15', 74, 3, 21, 137601) It is not too much to say, therefore, that every educated Indian is in duty bound to apply his mind to this question and join in discussing it so as to help in getting it finally settled.
('15', 74, 4, 22, 137789) This is not the place to go into details; for those, however, who wish to study the subject, there is literature in plenty and easily accessible: in particular, the debates in the Imperial Legislative Council on the resolution mentioned above, the Lord Sanderson Committee Report and the report of Messrs MacNeill and Chimanlal on the condition of indentured labourers.
('15', 74, 4, 23, 138159) If any paper gets a special note prepared on this literature, it is bound to prove useful.

('15', 76, 3, 12, 140234) You must work with faith to see that it does not change.
('15', 76, 3, 13, 140291) Even if it should change, if you do not succumb to the change it will change automatically again.
('15', 76, 3, 14, 140389) We must remember that the Ashram is still in its infancy.

('15', 76, 8, 21, 140747) Right up to the moment of death, he thought only of service to the country; the Servants of India Society was his very life to him.
('15', 76, 8, 22, 140879) I came into closer contact with him than others did and I observed that he was a man of great capacity.
('15', 76, 8, 23, 140983) He knew both how to live and how to die.

('15', 77, 8, 15, 142052) He must read Gujarati.

('15', 77, 8, 18, 142192) Or leave the matter to await my return.
('15', 77, 8, 19, 142232) He ought to be told to do grinding.

('15', 78, 3, 4, 143023) Dignity of labour means that students should wash their own clothes and do their own personal work like cooking, cleaning of utensils and so on.
('15', 78, 3, 5, 143168) They should abandon any false sense of shame in body labour.
('15', 78, 3, 6, 143229) I am against machines because big industries like steel and coal dehumanize men.
('15', 78, 3, 7, 143310) Rather than destroy big and small industries we must establish a balance between them and give first place to village industries.
('15', 78, 3, 8, 143440) I do accept the importance of primary education.
('15', 78, 3, 9, 143489) But I know many person who cannot read and write, yet are able to work efficiently, because of their intuitive understanding.
('15', 78, 3, 10, 143615) Hence, we cannot afford to wait for education.
('15', 78, 3, 11, 143662) History today teaches strife, treachery and intrigue, whereas it should give greater importance to noble deeds.
('15', 78, 3, 12, 143774) Man has no right to drink milk, because whether in human beings or animals nature has intended milk only for the young.
('15', 78, 3, 13, 143894) Hence whatever the arguments, there is no justification for drinking milk.
('15', 78, 3, 14, 143969) I believe in varnashramadharma but I do not believe in castes.
('15', 78, 3, 15, 144032) Vranashramadharma means that a man should find satisfaction in getting his livelihood from his ancestral occupation.
('15', 78, 3, 16, 144149) I am always in quest of truth.
('15', 78, 3, 17, 144180) For the sake of truth I have abandoned many of my ideas and acquired new ones.
('15', 78, 3, 18, 144259) I have never hesitated to give up the old and accept the new and will never hesitate as long as I live.

('15', 79, 2, 3, 144748) December 8, 1915
('15', 79, 3, 4, 144765) He [Gandhiji] expressed his great happiness at the unprecedented enthusiasm displayed by the people of Bhavnagar that day and the day before and offered them his heartfelt thanks.
('15', 79, 3, 5, 144945) He gave very useful advice to students and youth in general, appealed to the people of Bhavnagar to subscribe to the Memorial Fund for his guru, the late widely respected Honble Mr. Gopal Krishna Gokhale and explained the aims of the Servants of India Society established by him as also the great things expected of it.
('15', 79, 3, 6, 145265) Proceeding, he said: I was invited four months ago by the people of Bhavnagar to visit this place, but I could not do so then owing to certain circumstances.
('15', 79, 3, 7, 145423) But now that I am here, I see that my not coming here then has in a way furthered the purpose of my visit, for then Sir Prabhashanker was not here and, now that he is here, I have had the honour of receiving this address from the blessed hands of so popular an officer as he; what is more, there will beI am perfectly sure of thisa most substantial gain to the Memorial Fund for the late Honble Mr. Gokhale for which I have especially come here.

('15', 79, 8, 12, 145979) I am grateful to all my friends of the [Modh] community, who invited me here, for the love they have shown to me.
('15', 79, 8, 13, 146093) My Modh friends showed me the same love even when I landed in Bombay.
('15', 79, 8, 14, 146163) I do not deserve it, for I have rendered no service to the community.
('15', 79, 8, 15, 146233) Besides, my friends and members of the community ask me sometimes what good I have done to it, and accuse me of forsaking swadharma 2 and taking up paradharma 3. In reply, I shall merely say that I serve the

('15', 80, 1, 3, 146814) You express unbounded love for me at the moment but remember, friends, not to obstruct me when I do something which you may not approve of.
('15', 80, 1, 4, 146954) Even in those circumstances, I shall crave your blessings.
('15', 80, 1, 5, 147013) I feel so sad that even my own people do not know me.
('15', 80, 1, 6, 147067) I cannot keep with me a thing like this 1 made of silver, since I observe the rule of non possession.
('15', 80, 1, 7, 147169) If I do, a thief may try to steal it and I may then have to resort to violence for protecting it; this, again, will violate my rule of non violence.
('15', 80, 1, 8, 147318) I will therefore get it melted and use the money for the purposes of the Ashram.

('15', 81, 12, 22, 149226) People at Bhavnagar were very enthusiastic.

('15', 82, 5, 10, 150199) BHAISHRI 5 MAGANBHAI, I have received your mail from Bagasara.
('15', 82, 5, 11, 150262) If you wish to pay a visit to Dharmaj, you may do so after I come.
('15', 82, 5, 12, 150329) I am worried all the time that Shanti has still not got over his cough and Shivprasad is not rallying; I fret about it night and day.
('15', 82, 5, 13, 150463) I am making enquiries.
('15', 82, 5, 14, 150486) I am also consulting vaidyas.
('15', 82, 5, 15, 150516) Do we suffer from some major deficiency?
('15', 82, 5, 16, 150557) We must find out what it is and where it lies.
('15', 82, 5, 17, 150604) The visit to Porbundar is off.
('15', 82, 5, 18, 150635) We shall reach Limbdi on Monday evening.

('15', 83, 2, 3, 151513) HADALA, Sunday [December 12, 1915]
('15', 83, 3, 4, 151548) BHAISHRI 1 MAGANBHAI, I visited Bagasara today.
('15', 83, 3, 5, 151596) I got another batch of letters there.
('15', 83, 3, 6, 151634) There was one from Shivpujan too.
('15', 83, 3, 7, 151668) His argument seems to be correct.
('15', 83, 3, 8, 151702) We cannot experiment with the children who are put in our charge.
('15', 83, 3, 9, 151768) Therefore, if you consider it necessary, please introduce immediately provision of ghee and milk for the sick and for others who desire to take these.
('15', 83, 3, 10, 151919) Supply ghee to those who want it and arrange to get milk in sufficient quantity.
('15', 83, 3, 11, 152000) I think there is need to effect this change and watch matters for a few months.
('15', 83, 3, 12, 152080) It is certainly bad that so many should be in poor health.
('15', 83, 3, 13, 152139) If anyone needs buttermilk, we should give it to him and see.
('15', 83, 3, 14, 152201) Nobody should deprive himself of ghee from shyness.
('15', 83, 3, 15, 152253) Only those who are under a vow may abstain from ghee, or those who even though not under a vow want to do without it.
('15', 83, 3, 16, 152371) Shanti should not be given oil even in vegetables.
('15', 83, 3, 17, 152422) The expenditure on dried fruit should be brought down.
('15', 83, 3, 18, 152477) Shivpujan complains of undercooking.
('15', 83, 3, 19, 152514) Look into the matter.
('15', 83, 3, 20, 152536) Everything should be cooked well even if it takes more time.
('15', 83, 3, 21, 152597) I have nothing to say about the money sent for Anna.
('15', 83, 3, 22, 152650) Both of you enjoy a certain position and so what you have done at the moment can be justified.
('15', 83, 3, 23, 152745) This cannot be done for Mama 2. Payment could not be made to Krishnaswamy because there was no question of his becoming manager.
('15', 83, 3, 24, 152874) Mama of course has almost reached the position of manager.
('15', 83, 3, 25, 152933) Moreover in such work we must have one strict rule.
('15', 83, 3, 26, 152985) I am sending Shivpujans letter for you to see.
('15', 83, 3, 27, 153032) Be more lenient, not less, in my absence.
('15', 83, 3, 28, 153074) I do not wish that the students should have complaints to make against you.
('15', 83, 3, 29, 153150) It is necessary that Shivprasad, Shanti, Chhotam and others should get well at once.
('15', 83, 3, 30, 153235) Give milk to Sundaram.
('15', 83, 3, 31, 153258) He can have only a dhoti which we all have.

('15', 84, 9, 12, 153985) Gandhi in reply said he would now try his best to get Government to abolish the Customs arrangements at Viramgaon.
('15', 84, 9, 13, 154100) 2 His ostensible reason for touring Kathiawar was to collect subscriptions for the Gokhale Memorial Fund.
('15', 84, 9, 14, 154206) He collected some Rs. 250 at the meeting.
('15', 84, 10, 15, 154248) On the 15th December Gandhi visited Wadhwan City and Camp when he addressed meetings and asked for subscriptions towards the Fund.

('15', 86, 9, 16, 157198) Mr. Gandhi in support of the Resolution 2 said that they could not keep their industries if their industrial population went away from India and returned, if it ever did, a broken reed, a moral wreck.
('15', 86, 9, 17, 157399) The two adjectives, injurious and immoral were not chosen haphazard but they bore the imprimatur of their deceased countryman, Mr. Gokhale.
('15', 86, 9, 18, 157539) He urged them to insist on the abolition of the system even while the war was going on.

('15', 87, 7, 9, 158551) MY DEAR FRIEND, I have come to Bombay for the Congress week.
('15', 87, 7, 10, 158612) There is no sincerity about anything.
('15', 87, 7, 11, 158650) Much cry and little work proverb applies most appropriately.

('15', 87, 7, 15, 158862) Mrs. Gandhi is not here.

('15', 87, 12, 27, 159293) December 28, 1915
('15', 87, 13, 28, 159311) Mr. M. K. Gandhi (Bombay) moved Resolution X regarding India and the Colonies on 28th December 1915 at the 30th Indian National Congress session held at Bombay.
('15', 87, 13, 29, 159472) He said:
('15', 87, 14, 30, 159481) MR. PRESIDENT AND FRIENDS, The resolution that stands in my name reads thus:
('15', 88, 0, 1, 159558) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 89
('15', 88, 1, 2, 159599) This Congress regrets that the existing laws affecting Indians in South Africa and Canada have not, in spite of the liberal and imperialistic declarations of Colonial statesmen, been justly and equally administered and this Congress trusts that the self governing Colonies will extend to the Indian emigrants equal rights with European emigrants and that theImperial Government will use all possible means to secure the rights which have been hitherto unjustly withheld from them, thus causing widespread dissatisfaction and discontent.
('15', 88, 1, 3, 160136) May I please appeal to the Press to alter the word equally to equitably because that was the word given last night at the Subjects Committee meeting?
('15', 88, 2, 4, 160286) Friends, it is an irony of fate that, whilst this vast assembly will be regretting the attitude, the hostile attitude that has been adopted by the self governing Colonies, a contingent of your countrymen formed in South Africa will be nearing the theatre of war in order to help the sick and the wounded.
('15', 88, 2, 5, 160591) I am in possession of facts in connection with this contingent formed in South Africa, which shows that it is composed of the middle classes which, according to The Times of India, are going to form the future self governing nation.
('15', 88, 2, 6, 160824) These men are drawn from ex indentured Indians and their children; they are drawn from the petty hawkers, the toilers and the tradersall these men compose this great contingent.
('15', 88, 2, 7, 161002) And yet the Colonies do not consider it necessary to alter their attitude, nor do I see the logic in their altering their policy.
('15', 88, 2, 8, 161132) It is the fashion now a days to consider that because we have taken our humble share in the war by not being disloyal to the Government at the present juncture, we are entitled to rights which have been hitherto withheld from us as if those rights were withheld from us because our loyalty was suspected.
('15', 88, 2, 9, 161437) No, my friends.
('15', 88, 2, 10, 161453) If they have been withheld from us, the reasons are different and those reasons will have to be altered.
('15', 88, 2, 11, 161558) They are due, some of them, to undying prejudices; they are due, some of them, to economic causes and these will have to be examined.
('15', 88, 2, 12, 161692) The prejudices will have to be borne down.
('15', 88, 2, 13, 161735) What are the hardships that our countrymen are labouring under in South Africa, in Canada and in the other self governing Colonies?
('15', 88, 2, 14, 161867) In South Africa, the settlement of 1914 secured what the passive resisters were fighting for and nothing more and they were fighting for the restoration of legal equality in connection with emigration
('15', 89, 0, 1, 162068) 90 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 89, 1, 2, 162109) from British India and certain other things.
('15', 89, 1, 3, 162154) That legal equality has been restored, the other things granted, but the domestic troubles still remain, and if it was not the custom unfortunately inherited for the last thirty years that the language, the predominant language in the assembly, should be English, our Madras friends will have taken good care to learn one of the northern vernaculars and then there are men enough from South Africa who would tell you in one of our own tongues the difficulties that we have to go through even now in South Africa.
('15', 89, 1, 4, 162667) They are in connection with the holding oflanded property; they are in connection with men who, having been once domiciled in South Africa, return to South Africa; there are difficulties in connection with the admission of their children and in connection with trade licences.
('15', 89, 1, 5, 162944) These are, it I may call them so, bread and butter difficulties.
('15', 89, 1, 6, 163009) There are other difficulties which I shall not enumerate just now.
('15', 89, 1, 7, 163076) In Canada, it is not possible for those brave Sikhs who are domiciled there to bring their wives and children.
('15', 89, 1, 8, 163187) (Cries of Shame.) That is the difficulty in Canada.
('15', 89, 1, 9, 163239) The law is the same but the administration is vilely unequal.
('15', 89, 1, 10, 163301) I feel that this unequal administration will not be altered because of the splendid aid which India is said to have rendered to the Empire.
('15', 89, 1, 11, 163441) Then how are these difficulties to be met?
('15', 89, 1, 12, 163484) I do not intend to go into details, but the Congress proposes that this difficulty can be met by an appeal to the sense of justice of Colonial statesmen and by an appeal to the Imperial Government.
('15', 89, 1, 13, 163682) I fear that the Congress can only do this.
('15', 89, 1, 14, 163725) Lord Hardinge, only a few months ago, made a fervent appeal to Indian publicists and to Indian statesmen for helping him to come to an honourable solution which will retain the dignity of India and at the same time not cause any trouble to the self governing Colonies.
('15', 89, 1, 15, 163994) Lord Hardinge is still waiting for an answer.
('15', 89, 1, 16, 164040) That answer is not supplied by the Congress nor can it be supplied by the Congress.
('15', 89, 1, 17, 164124) It has to be supplied by associations such as the Imperial Citizenship Association, the specialists, if I may call them so.
('15', 89, 1, 18, 164248) The Congress has given them the lead and it is for these associations to frame the details in which they will have to examine the rival claims and offer to Lord Hardinge a detailed solution, a solution which will satisfy the Colonial Governments as well as the Indian people and will not take away any thing whatsoever from the just demands that this resolution makes.
('15', 89, 1, 19, 164617) With these words, I have much pleasure in proposing this resolution.
('15', 89, 1, 20, 164686) (Loud applause.)

('15', 122, 7, 11, 207527) January 2, 1916
('15', 122, 8, 12, 207543) You have laid me under a heavy debt by inviting me to attend this function and declare open the Arya Samaj temple and I am thankful likewise to the Samaj and to the people of Surat for asking me to preside over this celebration.
('15', 122, 8, 13, 207772) Let me tell you at the outset that I am not an Aryasamajist, as members of the Samaj, and others as well, know.
('15', 122, 8, 14, 207884) At the same time, I ought to say that I bear no ill will to the Samaj either.
('15', 122, 8, 15, 207962) I am not a member of this body just as I am not a member of any other body.
('15', 122, 8, 16, 208038) There are numerous other bodies like the Arya Samaj in India and they all do their best by way of service, but I have especial respect for the Samaj.
('15', 122, 8, 17, 208188) I have developed good relations with Munshiramji of the Gurukul at Hardwar.
('15', 122, 8, 18, 208264) My sons and other friends of mine had occasion to stay in that Gurukul 2 and it is not easy to forget the love which prompted all that was done for them.
('15', 122, 8, 19, 208418) The whole of India knows its work as much as I do.
('15', 122, 8, 20, 208469) Swami Dayanand, the adored founder of the Samaj, was a rare man and I must acknowledge that I have come under his influence.
('15', 122, 8, 21, 208594) I have had occasion to talk about the Arya Samaj at many places.
('15', 122, 8, 22, 208659) In my opinion, the Samaj could
('15', 122, 9, 23, 208690) 1 Gandhiji arrived at Surat to perform the opening ceremony of an Arya Samaj temple on January, 2, 1916; videSpeech at Salej, 9 1 1916
('15', 122, 10, 24, 208825) 2 The Phoenix party had stayed at Gurukul for some time and, in 1915 at the Kumbha Mela at Hardwar, it assisted the Volunteer Corps of the Servants of India Society.
('15', 122, 10, 25, 208991) Later, Gandhiji also joined the party.
('15', 123, 0, 1, 209030) 124 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 123, 1, 2, 209072) do very useful work if some change was brought about in it.
('15', 123, 1, 3, 209132) What needs to be changed is this,that some of the spokesmen of the Samaj seem to be only too ready to enter into violent controversy to gain their end.
('15', 123, 1, 4, 209284) They could, however, achieve their purpose without recourse to controversy.
('15', 123, 1, 5, 209360) I discussed this matter in Hardwar and mention it again here today.
('15', 123, 1, 6, 209428) The service that the Arya Samaj renders is not different from that of the Hindu religion.
('15', 123, 1, 7, 209518) If one examines different bodies like the Brahmo Samaj 1, the Sikh Samaj, etc., one sees that all of them express the truths of the Hindu religion.
('15', 123, 1, 8, 209666) Only the names differ.
('15', 123, 1, 9, 209689) Just as individual persons are mentioned by name for the purpose of a census, so are the various sects listed with some public good in view.
('15', 123, 1, 10, 209830) If you examine the basic principles of all the sects, they will be found to differ in no way from those of the Hindu religion.
('15', 123, 1, 11, 209957) The trend of the discussions at present going on shows unmistakably that a time will certainly come when all the sects of Hindus will be included under the single term Hinduism.
('15', 123, 1, 12, 210135) There are different religious groups in India like Hindus, Parsis, Muslims and so on, but for purposes of national work they all get united.
('15', 123, 1, 13, 210276) This will show that the spirit of religion is active in all.
('15', 123, 1, 14, 210337) Let it be remembered that without this spirit, no great task was ever ventured upon or ever will be.
('15', 123, 1, 15, 210438) I shall now make a few observations I feel like making on this occasion.
('15', 123, 1, 16, 210511) They will serve my own purpose and will also help me to discharge my duty.
('15', 123, 1, 17, 210586) I have been given half an hour now and one hour in the evening, a total of one and a half hours, for speaking, but it is beyond me to speak so long and see that you digest all that I say.
('15', 123, 1, 18, 210774) I like to have the shortest possible time for a speech and I have had good experience in the matter.
('15', 123, 1, 19, 210875) I have been at a good many places during the last 30 years and I have noticed that where there is much speaking, there is little work.
('15', 123, 1, 20, 211010) This charge has long been made against the whole of India.
('15', 123, 1, 21, 211069) It is made by Europeans, that is, by people from the West.
('15', 123, 1, 22, 211128) We deserve it.
('15', 123, 1, 23, 211143) It has been remarked even at a session of the Congress that we are fed only on speeches and discourses.
('15', 123, 1, 24, 211247) When shall we break free of this?
('15', 123, 1, 25, 211281) We are very much at fault on this count and find ourselves in a miserable plight in consequence.
('15', 123, 1, 26, 211378) As you know, there is much hunger in India, and it has always been hunger for spiritual food.
('15', 123, 1, 27, 211472) If, on occasions of such celebrations, the day is spent merely in listening to speeches for seven or eight hours, when can we have time for work?
('15', 123, 1, 28, 211618) If we had spent as much of our lives in work as
('15', 123, 2, 29, 211666) 1 A socio religious reform movement started by Raja Ram Mohan Roy
('15', 124, 0, 1, 211732) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 125
('15', 124, 1, 2, 211774) we have in listening to speeches, how much could have been accomplished in India by now.
('15', 124, 1, 3, 211863) If we had spent in doing sums in arithmetic all the time we wasted on speeches, I think India would be now on the threshold of swaraj.
('15', 124, 1, 4, 211998) We shall never get swaraj by listening to speeches and discourses, sitting in pandals like this.
('15', 124, 1, 5, 212095) It is to be had only through sacrifice of self and by making ourselves worthy of it.
('15', 124, 1, 6, 212180) I brought up this matter for discussion in the Congress session, at Hardwar and wherever else I went and, having got this opportunity today, place it before you.
('15', 124, 1, 7, 212342) Whenever I have occasion to speak, I have my say in brief and I shall continue to follow that practice.
('15', 124, 1, 8, 212446) I appeal to the speakers [today] to proceed apace likewise.
('15', 124, 1, 9, 212506) We arrange programmes of as many as seven hours of speeches at these gatherings.
('15', 124, 1, 10, 212587) If the men who have assembled here were given a hoe and a shovel each and made to work at digging the land here for that number of hours, and the land were sown, we should certainly have a good crop next year.
('15', 124, 1, 11, 212797) If I could take the leading workers of the Arya Samaj round the town and make them clean up the dirty spots, they would certainly earn the gratitude of the people of Surat.
('15', 124, 1, 12, 212970) We see that the people of the West are more keen on work than on speeches.
('15', 124, 1, 13, 213045) If at all you want to imitate them, imitate them in their good qualities.
('15', 124, 1, 14, 213119) You will learn much therefrom.
('15', 124, 1, 15, 213150) If, instead, you adopt foreign ways from them, you will invite your undoing.
('15', 124, 1, 16, 213227) If we could reduce the programme of speeches today from seven to four hours and give the three hours thus saved to doing something useful, the time would be better spent.
('15', 124, 1, 17, 213398) If merely listening to speeches could accomplish anything or cure our ailments, why, they arrange reading from the Bhagavat at so many places and these draw large audiences, but we shall find on several of these occasions that quite a few in the audience are dozing.
('15', 124, 1, 18, 213665) If we could get everything by submitting to speeches, we need do nothing else.
('15', 124, 1, 19, 213744) Only let the Brahmins go on with their readings from holy books and Puranas and our salvation would be assured.
('15', 124, 1, 20, 213856) Indians, thus enjoy speaking and hearing others speak and paying compliments to themselves.
('15', 124, 1, 21, 213948) They go to extremes in these matters.
('15', 124, 1, 22, 213986) If, instead, we were to hold our tongues, there is much we could learn.
('15', 124, 1, 23, 214058) Speaking hinders reflection.
('15', 124, 1, 24, 214087) If, on the other hand, you do something, be it what it may, that will lead to a discussion and the people will be enabled to draw some lesson from it.
('15', 124, 1, 25, 214238) I would, therefore, entreat you to employ every available minute in doing your duty.
('15', 124, 1, 26, 214323) A great saint has said that, if at any time too many ideas rush into ones mind.
('15', 124, 1, 27, 214403) one should not lose ones judgement.
('15', 124, 1, 28, 214439) One should not act upon them
('15', 125, 0, 1, 214468) 126 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 125, 1, 2, 214510) immediately.
('15', 125, 1, 3, 214523) One should sleep over them for a night and examine them with oneself from every point of view so as to cast out such of them as are of no value, discuss the rest with ones wife, exchange views with her and cut out those which are found unsound.
('15', 125, 1, 4, 214768) The idea that remains at the end, if one feels with all ones soul that it is true, one may act upon it and place it before the world undeterred by any attacks that may follow.
('15', 125, 1, 5, 214944) Only an idea that is held with such conviction can be translated into action, and no time will be wasted in consequence.
('15', 125, 1, 6, 215065) I respectfully submit that it is very necessary to take full thought before embarking upon any course of action.
('15', 125, 1, 7, 215178) It will be impudence on my part to tell you what ought to be done.
('15', 125, 1, 8, 215245) By my saying so, moreover, the thing will not be done.
('15', 125, 1, 9, 215300) What I have told you today is but my own experience and I would humbly request you, therefore, to accept from it only what may appeal to you as right.
('15', 125, 1, 10, 215451) Rather than imitate the West, it would be far more profitable to us to reject everything that they offer us.
('15', 125, 1, 11, 215560) If only you consider, they dont have speeches in Europe as we have, for they get no time to listen to any.
('15', 125, 1, 12, 215667) In order to make the progress that they are making, there are certain rights we must demand and secure from the Government.
('15', 125, 1, 13, 215791) For that purpose, we must get ready for a struggle.
('15', 125, 1, 14, 215843) I know that the honour people give me these days is because of the fight I gave to the Government for securing our rights and because of the suffering I went through in doing so.
('15', 125, 1, 15, 216022) We have to deserve such rights.
('15', 125, 1, 16, 216054) May you, therefore, read and think and learn from others in order to make yourselves so worthy and be fit to give a fight to the Government along the path of truth!
('15', 125, 1, 17, 216219) If the workers of this Samaj take the lead in doing this duty, that would be more profitable.
('15', 125, 1, 18, 216313) With these words I request your permission to resume my seat.
('15', 125, 2, 19, 216375) Replying to some observations of the speakers who followed him, Gandhiji said:
('15', 125, 3, 20, 216454) It is not enough that today, acting upon a hint from me, you did not indulge in long speeches to make things easy for me.
('15', 125, 3, 21, 216576) It will make me happier to know that you will never do so.
('15', 125, 3, 22, 216635) Pandit Ramchandraji put me an important question in the course of his speech.
('15', 125, 3, 23, 216713) He asked me to say how the world of the Arya Samaj could be made more useful and popular.
('15', 125, 3, 24, 216803) It is not only here that the question has come up.
('15', 125, 3, 25, 216854) It was also discussed when I was at Hardwar.
('15', 125, 3, 26, 216899) I have no time just now to answer it.
('15', 125, 3, 27, 216937) I shall argue with Panditshri about it if he visits me at Ahmedabad.
('15', 125, 3, 28, 217006) It will also be necessary to take into account the views of those who have different ideas on the subject.
('15', 125, 3, 29, 217113) I was asked by my guru, the late Mr. Gokhale, not to get involved in such controversies and
('15', 126, 0, 1, 217205) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 127
('15', 126, 1, 2, 217247) hence I avoid them.
('15', 126, 1, 3, 217267) This is not a controversy, however, with people not ones own.
('15', 126, 1, 4, 217329) I look upon members of this Samaj as my friends and I owe it to them to offer my advice.
('15', 126, 1, 5, 217418) I have been tested on the anvil and have stood the test; it is my duty, therefore, to share my experience with my friends.
('15', 126, 1, 6, 217541) We must strive every day for Indias progress.
('15', 126, 1, 7, 217587) 1In reply to one Balkrishna who argued against Gandhijis advice to refrain from controversies, he said: Following the advice of my guru, Mr. Gokhale, I do not enter into argument with anyone.
('15', 126, 1, 8, 217779) With the new year, I must remind myself of this and, since the issue has come up, I shall say that it is a very delicate one and the question cannot therefore be answered without some discussion.
('15', 126, 1, 9, 217975) I am not partial to anyone.
('15', 126, 1, 10, 218003) If I feel that I can serve India better by becoming a member of the Samaj, I will become one and when I feel that way, I shall immediately say so in public.
('15', 126, 1, 11, 218160) At the moment, I cannot give any reply to Mr. Balkrishna.
('15', 126, 1, 12, 218218) However, if he comes to Ahmedabad any time, I shall discuss the matter with him and satisfy him.

('15', 126, 5, 16, 218440) January 3, 1916
('15', 126, 6, 17, 218456) It is very surprising that students who deliver speeches in English do not see whether or not the audience can follow what they say.
('15', 126, 6, 18, 218589) Nor do they consider whether those who understand English will feel interested or bored by their broken, incorrect English.
('15', 126, 6, 19, 218713) It is a sad state of affairs that growing young people turn away from their own mother tongue and become such devoted lovers of a foreign language.
('15', 126, 6, 20, 218861) Those who argue that a new era has come to prevail in our country through foreign contacts, how much do they care to explain their new ideas to the people around them?
('15', 126, 6, 21, 219029) They ought to consider whether the new era will draw closer or recede farther by their prating in a language which their parents do not know, which their brothers and sisters do not know, and their servants, wives, children and

('15', 127, 1, 2, 219417) kinsfolk cannot follow.
('15', 127, 1, 3, 219441) There are some who think that English is our national language and that sooner or later it will be the language of all the people of the country, but this does not seem correct to me.
('15', 127, 1, 4, 219625) If we take a handful of persons who have received English education to be the nation, it must be said that we do not understand the meaning of the word nation.
('15', 127, 1, 5, 219785) I am sure it can never happen that 300 million people will pick up English, so that it becomes our national language.
('15', 127, 1, 6, 219903) Those who have been fortunate enough to acquire new knowledge and new ideas must explain their ideas to their friends?
('15', 127, 1, 7, 220022) kinsfolk and fellow countrymen.
('15', 127, 1, 8, 220054) To those young men who argue that they cannot express their ideas in their own language, I can only say that they are a burden to the motherland.
('15', 127, 1, 9, 220200) It does not become any son worthy of the name to slight his mother tongue, to turn away his face from it, instead of removing what imperfections it may have.
('15', 127, 1, 10, 220358) If we of the present generation neglect the mother tongue, future generations will have occasion to feel sorry for us.
('15', 127, 1, 11, 220477) We shall never cease being reproached by them.
('15', 127, 1, 12, 220524) I hope that all the students present here will take a vow that they will not use English at home unless it is absolutely necessary to do so.
('15', 127, 2, 13, 220665) Parents also should be on their guard against being carried away by the tide of the modern age.
('15', 127, 2, 14, 220761) We do want the English language, but we do not want it to destroy our own language.
('15', 127, 2, 15, 220845) Our societywill be reformed only through our own language.
('15', 127, 2, 16, 220904) We can ensure simplicity and dignity in communication only through our own language.
('15', 127, 2, 17, 220989) Students, and their parents as well, should all aspire for a high level of proficiency in their own tongue.
('15', 127, 2, 18, 221097) If this library opened by me helps to weaken rather than nourish our language, I cannot help feeling sorry when I hear of the fact.

('15', 128, 2, 3, 221349) January 3, 1916
('15', 128, 3, 4, 221365) What can the heart speak when it is attuned to other hearts?
('15', 128, 3, 5, 221426) I was told by many even in South Africa that, when I returned to India, others might or might not help me, but that there was a Patidar 2 Youth Association which would be only too ready to help me in my work.
('15', 128, 3, 6, 221635) It was my wish all along to come here and visit this institution at the first available opportunity after returning to India and that makes me all the more delighted.
('15', 128, 3, 7, 221802) How far this Association helps me will be seen when the time comes, but it certainly has men of character.

('15', 128, 6, 10, 221988) January 3, 1916
('15', 128, 7, 11, 222004) SISTERS AND BROTHERS, I should have been here at two but I could not; kindly forgive me for that.
('15', 128, 7, 12, 222102) I find myself in difficulties wherever I go.
('15', 128, 7, 13, 222147) I have one or two days at my disposal and too many people to meet and too many places to see, with the result that I cannot always manage to be punctual.
('15', 128, 7, 14, 222301) Nor can I deny myself to anyone.
('15', 128, 7, 15, 222334) Yesterday, a subject was suggested to me for a speech, but I did not like to speak on it.
('15', 128, 7, 16, 222424) It has again been suggested today.
('15', 128, 7, 17, 222459) I shall, therefore, as desired, place before you what few ideas I can.
('15', 128, 7, 18, 222530) We find everyone in India in a state of fear, so much so that a father and a son dare not speak frankly to each other.
('15', 128, 7, 19, 222649) The reason for this, you will find, is that it has become difficult to speak the truth.
('15', 128, 7, 20, 222737) One is always in doubt whether ones words will please the other person or not.
('15', 128, 7, 21, 222816) So long as this is our condition, we shall never be able to speak the truth.
('15', 128, 7, 22, 222893) While this state of fear continues, we shall always remain backward and shall always be dogged by misery.
('15', 128, 7, 23, 222999) From the prevalent atmosphere, it seems that the people are eager for something to be done.
('15', 128, 7, 24, 223091) What is that something?
('15', 128, 8, 25, 223115) 1 In reply to an address from the Surat District Patidar Youth Association 2 Landlord 3 On the second day of the celebration
('15', 129, 0, 1, 223240) 130 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 129, 1, 2, 223282) Allow me to point out that we shall have to suffer whatever work we take up.
('15', 129, 1, 3, 223359) In taking up any work, we must first decide on the course we want to follow and then go ahead fearlessly.
('15', 129, 1, 4, 223465) We are afraid at the sight of a policeman.
('15', 129, 1, 5, 223508) We feel afraid if it is but a station master.
('15', 129, 1, 6, 223554) Why this fear?
('15', 129, 1, 7, 223569) It is there because we are afraid of speaking the truth.
('15', 129, 1, 8, 223626) Though they are men in authority, they are in a way our servants, since their services are paid for from public revenues.
('15', 129, 1, 9, 223748) Why, then, should we be afraid of those whom we have ourselves appointed?
('15', 129, 1, 10, 223822) Only when people become fearless will they wipe out this charge of timidity.
('15', 129, 1, 11, 223899) I would say that fear springs in a man from within, that no one puts the fear into him.
('15', 129, 1, 12, 223987) If you stand by the side of a wild animal, like a tiger, utterly fearless, he will play with you; if you try to run away, he will kill you.
('15', 129, 1, 13, 224127) If, for example, you run because of the barking of a dog, he will run after you, but he will play with you if you face him fearlessly.
('15', 129, 1, 14, 224262) Government officers are in fact our servants.
('15', 129, 1, 15, 224308) We should entertain no fear of them, though we should not behave rudely to them either.
('15', 129, 1, 16, 224396) There must be courtesy even in dealing with servants.
('15', 129, 1, 17, 224450) We should follow truth, and be fearless in doing so.
('15', 129, 1, 18, 224503) A coward is himself afraid and fills others with fear.
('15', 129, 1, 19, 224558) Such is the condition of affairs in families and communities.
('15', 129, 1, 20, 224620) Where, then, shall we voice the demand for reform?
('15', 129, 1, 21, 224671) Everyone who desires reform in his community only talks about the matter before others, saying: Oh yes!
('15', 129, 1, 22, 224775) There is need for such a reform, certainly.
('15', 129, 1, 23, 224819) But you know what our community is like!
('15', 129, 1, 24, 224860) The members would raise a storm. To be afraid in this way and do nothing is no credit to ones manliness.
('15', 129, 1, 25, 224965) The other members of the community would not feel for our daughter as we do.
('15', 129, 1, 26, 225042) I know the way caste affairs are managed; everywhere there is the same story.
('15', 129, 1, 27, 225120) Parents remain in great fear for their daughters.
('15', 129, 1, 28, 225170) Any reform that is necessary in this matter must be carried out.
('15', 129, 1, 29, 225235) If that is not done, to what end do bodies like the Arya Samaj exist?
('15', 129, 1, 30, 225305) The poet Akha has said; Live as you will, Realize God anyhow, anyway.
('15', 129, 2, 31, 225375) We are to seek Hari 1 through these activities.
('15', 129, 2, 32, 225423) We cannot attain Him till we have realized the self.
('15', 129, 2, 33, 225476) This country is ever in the forefront with words, but hindmost in action.
('15', 129, 2, 34, 225550) This charge against our country must go, however.
('15', 129, 2, 35, 225600) It was my experience in South Africa that people spoke with a profuse flow of words at meetings, declared themselves ready in their speeches even for imprisonment, but, when the testing time came, they made themselves scarce.
('15', 129, 2, 36, 225826) A man is one person when

('15', 130, 1, 2, 225902) speaking and another when the time for action comes.
('15', 130, 1, 3, 225955) Then, fear takes possession of his heart.
('15', 130, 1, 4, 225997) Till you have driven out that fear, you will make no progress, material or spiritual.
('15', 130, 1, 5, 226083) People in India will know real life only when they have shed all fear.
('15', 130, 1, 6, 226154) The country has a population of three hundred million.
('15', 130, 1, 7, 226209) Even if only a few of these come forward, they will give a lead to the rest.
('15', 130, 1, 8, 226286) One good coin is of greater worth than millions of bad ones.
('15', 130, 1, 9, 226347) With these words, I beg leave to resume my seat.
('15', 130, 1, 10, 226396) I should tell you that I have yet another appointment elsewhere.
('15', 130, 1, 11, 226461) Kindly give me leave, therefore, and go on with the rest of the programme.

('15', 130, 5, 15, 226628) January 3, 1916
('15', 130, 6, 16, 226644) SISTERS AND BROTHERS, I have grown weary listening to my praises on this occasion and I am sure you too are tired, as it has grown so late, and you must be disinclined to hear a long speech.
('15', 130, 6, 17, 226835) That you all shout no means nothing in particular; I know it only signifies our good manners in India.
('15', 130, 6, 18, 226938) I thank you very much indeed for the sentiments you have expressed about my wife.
('15', 130, 6, 19, 227020) The reason, as far as I know for all that is being said about me and my wife is that the sentiments the high souled Shri Gokhale expressed about us here 2, in India, are still echoing.
('15', 130, 6, 20, 227205) We, husband and wife, were not the only ones in South Africa to have gone to gaol; there were many others.
('15', 130, 6, 21, 227312) A young girl of 17, fresh from Vanitavishram 3, went to gaol, and her husband too.
('15', 130, 6, 22, 227395) While in gaol, he died of an illness.
('15', 130, 6, 23, 227433) It has become a custom in India to show respect to anyone who happens to be present.
('15', 130, 6, 24, 227518) India needs to wake up; without an awakening, there can be no progress.
('15', 130, 6, 25, 227590) To bring it about in the country, one must place some programme before it.
('15', 130, 6, 26, 227665) The question then is: how to bring about awakening and spread understanding in the country.
('15', 130, 6, 27, 227757) I had a key with me for this purpose; it was this: I first learnt the language of the people through whom I had
('15', 130, 7, 28, 227869) 1 Under the auspices of the District Bar Association 2 While Gandhiji was in South Africa 3 A girls school
('15', 131, 0, 1, 227976) 132 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 131, 1, 2, 228018) to work and I told them, in their own language, of the situation in which I found myself, seeking from them the line of action which would best meet the needs of that situation.
('15', 131, 1, 3, 228196) It was entirely because of this approach that they could appreciate the situation as I saw it and they came to my help.
('15', 131, 1, 4, 228316) Then, again, once on coming out of gaol I received a letter, telling me that the leaders had left and asking me what I could do by myself.
('15', 131, 1, 5, 228455) But lo!
('15', 131, 1, 6, 228463) 20,000 men were afire without there being anyone to lead themsuch is the experience I have had.
('15', 131, 1, 7, 228559) What did it matter if all had left?
('15', 131, 1, 8, 228595) If, therefore, you desire to work for the good of India, give primary education to its three hundred million people, not the kind of education that goes by that name at present but such education as will impart to them the knowledge that is required in these times.
('15', 131, 1, 9, 228861) Teach them why it is that India is growing more and more abject.
('15', 131, 1, 10, 228926) The poor and the illiterate should know that this is happening because they are being deprived of everything.
('15', 131, 1, 11, 229036) In consequence of this abject attitude, men are in a constant state of fear and are afraid of anyone in authority, even a policeman.
('15', 131, 1, 12, 229169) There is so much of fear in India today that a father and a son distrust each other and cannot exchange ideas.
('15', 131, 1, 13, 229280) We should, therefore, spread the right kind of knowledge in order that we might end this state of affairs.
('15', 131, 1, 14, 229387) I came by such knowledge in 1896 in a mantra 1 I learnt from the late Mr. Gokhale.
('15', 131, 1, 15, 229470) Surat is a city of heroes.
('15', 131, 1, 16, 229497) Blessed by the poet Narmad 2, it enjoys immortal fame.
('15', 131, 1, 17, 229552) It has suffered frequently from the ravages of fire and flood but it continues on its even course, fair to all.
('15', 131, 1, 18, 229664) From the very same city of Surat came Ahmad Mahomed 3 and Sorabji Shapurji 4, who carried on a brave fight in South Africa and were imprisoned again and again but did not lose heart in the least.
('15', 131, 1, 19, 229860) Such are the heroes who belong to Surat and I have great respect for this town.
('15', 131, 1, 20, 229940) When I returned to India, I wanted that my first visit should be to Surat but unforeseen circumstances prevented this.
('15', 131, 1, 21, 230059) I am extremely grateful to the people of this city for the affection they have showered on me today.
('15', 131, 1, 22, 230160) I hope that you will continue to give me the same love and help me whenever I need your services.
('15', 131, 1, 23, 230258) I dont propose to spend away what I have saved from my earnings, for I am a bania.
('15', 131, 1, 24, 230341) I shall

('15', 132, 1, 3, 230756) I dont ask for any money from you for my own purpose.
('15', 132, 1, 4, 230810) But I only hope that anything that I may ask for a public cause, you will be generous enough to give.
('15', 132, 1, 5, 230912) What I want from you is some contribution to the Memorial Fund for the late Mr. Gokhale.
('15', 132, 1, 6, 231001) I have been able to collect thirteen to fourteen thousand from towns in Kathiawar and I hope I shall get a good sum from a city like Surat.
('15', 132, 1, 7, 231141) I have heard that Surat has done nothing in this matter, I called today on Mr. Adwani, the District Judges and mentioned the matter to him.
('15', 132, 1, 8, 231281) He told me that nothing had been done about it; but that he would be happy if something was done, that he encouraged such an effort and would agree to put down Rs. 50/ as his contribution.
('15', 132, 1, 9, 231470) You know how very important this project is.
('15', 132, 1, 10, 231515) It is necessary to preserve Mr. Gokhales legacy.
('15', 132, 1, 11, 231564) And so let everyone, from the highest to the lowest, give anything he thinks fit.
('15', 132, 1, 12, 231646) It has been said of Surat that it is slow to be roused but that, when need arises, it wakes up and does what no other city will be able to do.
('15', 132, 1, 13, 231789) Once again, I thank the people of Surat for the great love they have shown me and beg leave to resume my seat.

('15', 132, 5, 17, 232005) January 3, 1916
('15', 132, 6, 18, 232021) This gathering reminds me of South Africa, where the Hindus, Parsis and Muslims had become one.
('15', 132, 6, 19, 232117) I find here in Surat the same bond of brotherhood between Hindus and Muslims which I have found wherever I have moved in India.
('15', 132, 6, 20, 232245) From among my old friends in South Africa whom I have met here, Abdul Kadir Bawazeer shared much suffering with me.
('15', 132, 6, 21, 232361) If I were to speak about that, I would take long and I dont have all that time.
('15', 132, 6, 22, 232441) I shall, therefore, tell you in brief that I returned to India with the desire to render equal service to both the communities, Hindus and Muslims.
('15', 132, 6, 23, 232589) We shall accomplish the tasks that face us in India only when my Hindu, Muslim and Parsi brethren feel that they are all one.
('15', 132, 6, 24, 232715) It would be best if the community that happened to be in the majority [at any place] realized that it was for

('15', 133, 1, 2, 232948) that community to see that there were no quarrels.
('15', 133, 1, 3, 232999) The leaders of each community should regard themselves as belonging to both communities and lead any movement accordingly.
('15', 133, 1, 4, 233122) With the growth of brotherly relations between these two communities, you will have better zeal for work.
('15', 133, 1, 5, 233228) In South Africa, Hindus and Muslims live as brothers.
('15', 133, 1, 6, 233282) In a right cause, a community can win even if it fights single handed.
('15', 133, 1, 7, 233353) It is the same God, service to whom ensures our salvation; if, then, our two communities live in harmony, we shall have all that we want dropping into our hands, so to say.
('15', 133, 1, 8, 233526) To ensure this, we must behave with no fear in our hearts, and with a mind that is ever the same.
('15', 133, 1, 9, 233624) Finally, I thank you for the kind things you have said in your address and in the speeches and pray to God that I may make no distinction of Hindu and Muslim and may ever serve both.
('15', 133, 1, 10, 233807) May you also pray likewise.

('15', 133, 6, 16, 234036) It would be greatly for Indias good if our people were like the late Mr. Hoosen Dawad 2. You can achieve much if you follow his example.
('15', 133, 6, 17, 234173) When in Surat, I called on Mr. Hudson, the Collector.
('15', 133, 6, 18, 234227) On my requesting him to be of help to the Indians going to South Africa, he asked me how he could help those who wanted to secure false certificates on the basis of incorrect statements.
('15', 133, 6, 19, 234414) I would advise you, therefore, not to follow such practices.
('15', 133, 6, 20, 234475) Going to South Africa is likely to bring you no great profit.
('15', 133, 6, 21, 234537) We should rather strive to earn honestly whatever we can here in India.

('15', 134, 5, 6, 235255) January 4, 1916
('15', 134, 6, 7, 235271) I have come here to see an old friend of mine.
('15', 134, 6, 8, 235318) Hindus and Muslims should become united; that is the desire I have expressed at every place.
('15', 134, 6, 9, 235411) I hope both these communities will help me.
('15', 134, 6, 10, 235455) When I started from Kathor in a small bullock cart; I was in a hurry and as I wished, for the sake of my personal convenience, to reach here early, I did not mind when bullocks were struck with a goad.
('15', 134, 6, 11, 235657) Hinduism, however, teaches us that we should not hurt cows and bullocks.
('15', 134, 6, 12, 235730) The sacred book of Islam stresses the importance of compassion.
('15', 134, 6, 13, 235794) I felt that it was cruel to strike bullocks with a goad.
('15', 134, 6, 14, 235851) In England, this is a punishable offence, but here no action is taken in the matter.
('15', 134, 6, 15, 235936) The scriptures of both the religions lay down that we should not inflict cruelty on even the meanest of creatures.
('15', 134, 6, 16, 236051) I also will have to answer for this in the court of the Almighty.
('15', 134, 6, 17, 236117) When I come here again, it will make me happy to see that the sticks are no longer spiked.
('15', 134, 6, 18, 236208) If I do not find that you have done so., I shall prefer going on foot rather than in the bullock cart.
('15', 134, 6, 19, 236311) We should not strike animals which happen to be weak.
('15', 134, 6, 20, 236365) Let us remember that if any person strikes us, we abuse him.
('15', 134, 6, 21, 236426) Finally, I thank you for the kindness shown to me.

('15', 135, 2, 3, 236635) January 5, 1916
('15', 135, 3, 4, 236651) Gentlemen, I am sorry I could not be here before you yesterday and you had all, therefore, to go back disappointed.
('15', 135, 3, 5, 236767) 1 We, satyagrahis, can have our way in everything on which we set our heart, but in the face of an accident we are helpless.
('15', 135, 3, 6, 236892) I am grateful to you all for your being so full of love and respect for me.
('15', 135, 3, 7, 236968) The credit for the work done by me in South Africa should go to Fakira Koli 2 and others who helped me.
('15', 135, 3, 8, 237072) What I did there was to explain dearly to my countrymen the new laws enacted there and get them amended through satyagraha.
('15', 135, 3, 9, 237196) My efforts were for the most part successful.
('15', 135, 3, 10, 237242) I could guide the people there along the right path.
('15', 135, 3, 11, 237295) In India, I find things are different.
('15', 135, 3, 12, 237334) Here, if I asked people to go through some suffering, they would turn their back in fear.
('15', 135, 3, 13, 237424) I pray to God to give me strength that I might do some little service to my country and my countrymen.
('15', 135, 3, 14, 237527) Navsari 3 owes much to its Parsi population.
('15', 135, 3, 15, 237572) I congratulate this small community, which plays a leading part in every field.
('15', 135, 3, 16, 237652) Relatively to other [Indian] communities in South Africa, this community is so small that its members are as the little stones found in a heap of wheat.
('15', 135, 3, 17, 237805) Even so, the Parsis played their part very bravely, and Parsee Rustomjee especially deserves great honour.
('15', 135, 3, 18, 237912) 4 I express my thanks to you all for the great honour the members of the Koli community and other gentlemen have done me.
('15', 135, 4, 19, 238034) Refusing the silver casket presented along with the address, Gandhiji said: I do not keep with me such valuable articles.
('15', 135, 4, 20, 238156) I want to put it to sale and use the proceeds for some good work.

('15', 136, 2, 3, 238852) AHMEDABAD, January 13, 1916
('15', 136, 3, 4, 238880) DEAR MR. SHASTRIAR, You have anticipated me.
('15', 136, 3, 5, 238925) I had told Dr. Deva that I would place my conclusions before you, if possible, during the Congress week.
('15', 136, 3, 6, 239030) I was unable to do so.
('15', 136, 3, 7, 239053) Now, however, that the members have already begun to consider the question, perhaps it is unnecessary for me to set forth my conclusions.
('15', 136, 3, 8, 239191) The members are coming to a just decision in not having me as a member.
('15', 136, 3, 9, 239263) Whilst there is possibility of co operation when we are working independently, I can see that I would, as a member, become a disturbing factor.
('15', 136, 3, 10, 239407) The methods of the Society as such are so totally different from mine in many respects.
('15', 136, 3, 11, 239495) Our common discipleship would constitute an indissoluble bond though we would be following out Mr. Gokhales work from different view points.

('15', 136, 10, 19, 239830) Even six letters in a year you do not call a brilliant performance.
('15', 136, 10, 20, 239898) Do you?
('15', 136, 10, 21, 239906) However I must
('15', 136, 11, 22, 239921) 1 Gandhiji writes in The Story of My Experiments with Truth: I saw clearly that, when there was such a sharp division amongst the members of the Society over admitting me, by far the best course for me was to withdraw my application for admission and save those opposed to me from a delicate situation.
('15', 136, 11, 23, 240224) Therein I thought lay my loyalty to the Society and Gokhale.
('15', 136, 11, 24, 240285) .The withdrawal of my application made me truly a member of the Society. Part V, Ch. Vl.

('15', 137, 1, 3, 240617) You might at least have given me the credit for uttering no such nonsense as Mrs. Besants correspondent attributed to me.
('15', 137, 1, 4, 240739) Natarajan 1
('15', 137, 2, 5, 240751) apologised for reproducing the calumny.
('15', 137, 2, 6, 240791) What I did say bore a totally different construction.
('15', 137, 2, 7, 240845) I made use of a Gujarati proverb in defence of my proposition that man continually did an injustice to woman by using her for his lusts.
('15', 137, 2, 8, 240982) I have taken such vow as you attribute to me about anger.
('15', 137, 2, 9, 241040) And if I had, I agree with you that it would lose all point by being disclosed.
('15', 137, 2, 10, 241120) I quite agree with you that Polak has done more during the past 18 months than what he did even in India.
('15', 137, 2, 11, 241226) I would certainly feel delighted if Thambi 2 came.
('15', 137, 2, 12, 241277) But it is not a nice thing to pay his debts out of the passive resistance funds.

('15', 137, 6, 17, 241535) I had no idea whatsoever that you had planned to present an a ddress to me on the last day of the celebrations.
('15', 137, 6, 18, 241647) I have never received from anywhere else as much money as has been presented to me here at Bavla 5. Hereafter, I shall have occasions to accept such funds and they will always be rightly used.
('15', 137, 6, 19, 241840) I have so far done no work in this country and yet the affection showered on me is beyond measure.
('15', 137, 6, 20, 241939) Serving the motherland is not possible as long as ones heart is not purified.
('15', 137, 6, 21, 242017) Even those who fight with weapons are required to give up their attachment to life.
('15', 137, 6, 22, 242101) Similarly, if we have some disease, we have to sacrifice our bodies for the sake of our souls.

('15', 138, 6, 10, 243204) You have got to take your LL.B. I would wish that no one helps you in becoming a barrister.
('15', 138, 6, 11, 243296) If your health does not suffer in the process of becoming a lawyer.
('15', 138, 6, 12, 243364) It should be a blessing for you.
('15', 138, 6, 13, 243397) The fact that you could think only of five poisons as medicines for your body is the bad effect of your past actions.

('15', 138, 6, 17, 243738) You must work only from there.
('15', 138, 6, 18, 243769) I shall get the work done through you.

('15', 139, 6, 8, 244674) [Before February 4, 1916]
('15', 139, 7, 9, 244700) All that you do, and all you enjoy, What you offer in sacrifice, what you give in charity, All austerities that you go through, Render up everything to me.
('15', 139, 8, 10, 244856) When, smiling and playing my way through life, I see Hari revealed to me, a visible presence, Then shall I consider my life To have attained its true end.
('15', 139, 8, 11, 245011) Muktanands 3 Lord, who sports with us, O Odha 4 !
('15', 139, 8, 12, 245061) He is the thread of our lives.
('15', 139, 8, 13, 245092) The counsel Shri Krishna addressed to Arjuna was, as it were, addressed by Lady India to Mahatma Gokhale and taken to heart by the latter, such was the manner of life of this great, departed soul.
('15', 139, 8, 14, 245289) It is a fact known to everyone that all his activities, all his joys and thesacrifices he made, all the suffering he went through, were dedicated to Mother India.
('15', 139, 8, 15, 245452) The state of Odhavas mind 5 with regard to Shri Krishna, as depicted by Muktanand, was that of the late Gokhale with regard to India.
('15', 139, 8, 16, 245586) What is the message of a life such as this?
('15', 139, 8, 17, 245630) The Mahatma did not leave even this unsaid.
('15', 139, 8, 18, 245674) When dying, he sent for the members of the Servants of India Society who were then present and told them: Do

('15', 140, 1, 2, 246090) not occupy yourselves with writing my biography or spend your time in putting up my statues.
('15', 140, 1, 3, 246183) If you are true servants of India, dedicate your lives to the fulfilment of our aims, to the service of India. We know, too, what he felt in his heart about the meaning of that service.
('15', 140, 1, 4, 246369) The Congress should of course be kept alive, the true condition of the country should be placed before the people through speeches and writings and efforts made to have education provided to every Indian.
('15', 140, 1, 5, 246574) What was the aim behind all this?
('15', 140, 1, 6, 246608) And how was it to be realized?
('15', 140, 1, 7, 246639) In answering these questions, we get to know his point of view.
('15', 140, 1, 8, 246703) Framing a constitution for the Servants [of India] Society, he laid down that the duty of its members would be to spiritualize political life in India.
('15', 140, 1, 9, 246855) This embraces everything.
('15', 140, 1, 10, 246881) His was a religious life.
('15', 140, 1, 11, 246907) My soul stands witness that, in all that he did, at all times, he acted wholly in the spirit of religion.
('15', 140, 1, 12, 247013) Some twenty years ago, this Mahatmas sentiments sometimes appeared to be those of an atheist.
('15', 140, 1, 13, 247107) He said once: I dont have Ranades 1 faith.
('15', 140, 1, 14, 247150) How I should like to have it! Even at that time, however, I could see a religious bent of mind in his actions.
('15', 140, 1, 15, 247261) It would not be wrong to say that his very doubt proceeded from such a bent of mind.
('15', 140, 1, 16, 247346) He who lives in the manner of a sadhu, whose desires are simple, who is the image of truth, is full of humility, who represents the very essence of truth and has wholly renounced his ego, such a one is a holy soul, whether he knows it or not.
('15', 140, 1, 17, 247589) Such a one was Mahatma Gokhale, as I could see from my twenty years acquaintance with him.
('15', 140, 2, 18, 247680) In 1896, I discussed [with leaders] in India the question of in dentured labour in Natal.
('15', 140, 2, 19, 247770) At that time, I knew the Indian leaders only by name.
('15', 140, 2, 20, 247824) This was the first occasion when I had contact with he le aders at Calcutta, Bombay, Poona and Madras.
('15', 140, 2, 21, 247927) The late Gokhale was then known as a follower of Ranade.
('15', 140, 2, 22, 247984) He had already at this time de dicated his life to the Fergusson College.
('15', 140, 2, 23, 248058) I was a mere youth, with no experience.
('15', 140, 2, 24, 248098) The bond which developed between us on the occasion of our very first meeting in Poona never came to exist between any other leader and me.
('15', 140, 2, 25, 248238) Sure enough, all that I had heard about Mahatma Gokhale was confirmed by my own experience; but especially the effect which the soft expression on his lotus like face had on me has still not vanished from my mind.
('15', 140, 2, 26, 248452) I instantly recognized him as dharma incarnate.
('15', 140, 2, 27, 248500) I had an audience with Shri Ranade, too, at that

('15', 141, 1, 2, 248698) time, but I could get no glimpse into his heart.
('15', 141, 1, 3, 248747) I could only see him as Gokhales mentor.
('15', 141, 1, 4, 248788) Whether it was that he was much senior to me in age and experience or that there were some other reasons, whatever the reason, I could not understand Shri Ranade as well as I could Gokhale.
('15', 141, 2, 5, 248978) After this contact with him in 1896, Gokhales political life be came my ideal.
('15', 141, 2, 6, 249057) That very time he took possession of my heart as my guru in matters political.
('15', 141, 2, 7, 249136) He edited the Quarterly of the Sarvajanik Sabha, he made Fergusson College illustrious by teaching there.
('15', 141, 2, 8, 249242) He gave evidence before the Welby Commission 1 and demonstrated his true worth to India.
('15', 141, 2, 9, 249331) He created so fine an impression on Lord Curzon 2
('15', 141, 3, 10, 249381) by his ability that the latter, who feared none, feared him.
('15', 141, 3, 11, 249442) By his performance in the Central Legislative Assembly, he brought credit to India.
('15', 141, 3, 12, 249526) At the risk of his life, he served on the Public Service Commission.
('15', 141, 3, 13, 249595) He did all this and much more.
('15', 141, 3, 14, 249626) Others have given a far better account of these things than I could hope to.
('15', 141, 3, 15, 249703) Moreover, one cannot claim that his message, as I have understood it and defined it here, may be clearly deduced from these actions of his.
('15', 141, 3, 16, 249843) I, therefore propose to conclude this article by relating what I have myself known and what exemplifies his message.
('15', 141, 4, 17, 249960) The satyagraha struggle made so profound an impression on his mind that, though his health absolutely forbade it, he decided to pay a visit to South Africa.
('15', 141, 4, 18, 250117) He went there in 1912. The Indians in South Africa gave him a right royal welcome.
('15', 141, 4, 19, 250200) On the very next day after his arrival in Cape Town, there was a meeting in the local Town Hall.
('15', 141, 4, 20, 250297) The Mayor was in the chair.
('15', 141, 4, 21, 250325) Gokhale was in no condition to attend meetings and make speeches.
('15', 141, 4, 22, 250391) But he left intact all the countless and taxing engagements that had been fixed.
('15', 141, 4, 23, 250472) Following this decision, he attended the meeting in the Town Hall.
('15', 141, 4, 24, 250539) At that very first appearance, he conquered the hearts of the whites in Cape Town.
('15', 141, 4, 25, 250622) Everyone felt that a great soul was visiting South Africa.
('15', 141, 4, 26, 250681) Mr. Merriman 3, a prominent leader in South Africa and a man of character and liberal views, had this to say when they met: Sir, a visit by a person like you brings a breath of fresh air into this land of ours.
('15', 141, 5, 27, 250892) 1 The Royal Commission on Expenditure (popularly known as the Welby Commission) appointed in 1894 to consider the question of apportionment of military expenditure between England and India 2 (1859 1925), Viceroy of India, 1899 1905 3 (1841 1926), M.L.A., Union of South Africa
('15', 142, 0, 1, 251170) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 143
('15', 142, 1, 2, 251212) As the late Mr. Gokhales tour progressed, this first impression became stronger.
('15', 142, 1, 3, 251293) At every place the distinction between whites and Coloureds was forgotten for the moment.
('15', 142, 1, 4, 251383) There were meetings in all places like the one held in Cape Town.
('15', 142, 1, 5, 251449) The whites and Indians sat in the same rows at these meetings and, according equal honour to the late Mr. Gokhale, earned similar honour for themselves.
('15', 142, 1, 6, 251602) There was a dinner in his honour in Johannesburg.
('15', 142, 1, 7, 251652) It was attended by nearly three hundred prominent whites.
('15', 142, 1, 8, 251710) The Mayor was in the chair.
('15', 142, 1, 9, 251738) The whites in Johannesburg are not likely to be awed by anyone.
('15', 142, 1, 10, 251802) If they have some multi millionaires among them, they have also men who know peoples worth.
('15', 142, 1, 11, 251894) These vied with one another in shaking hands with Mr. Gokhale.
('15', 142, 1, 12, 251957) There was only one reason for this.
('15', 142, 1, 13, 251993) In his speeches, the audiences saw Gokhales overflowing love for his motherland and a sense of fairness, at the same time.
('15', 142, 1, 14, 252116) He wanted his country to be treated with the fullest respect and honour but did not want that any other country should be humiliated.
('15', 142, 1, 15, 252250) If he was anxious to see all the rights of his countrymen preserved, he was equally anxious to see that the rights of others were not jeopardized in the process.
('15', 142, 1, 16, 252412) Because of this, everyone felt a genuine sweetness in his utterances.
('15', 142, 1, 17, 252482) Mr. Gokhale believed that he delivered in Johannesburg his best speech 1 in South Africa.
('15', 142, 1, 18, 252572) It lasted more than three quarters of an hour but I never felt that anyone in the audience was bored.
('15', 142, 1, 19, 252674) How did he make this speech?
('15', 142, 1, 20, 252703) He started preparing for it six days in advance.
('15', 142, 1, 21, 252752) He acquainted himself with the history of the question, as much as was necessary for his purpose, posted himself with the relevant figures and, sitting up late the preceding night, got ready with his language.
('15', 142, 1, 22, 252962) The result was as I have stated.
('15', 142, 1, 23, 252995) He satisfied both the whites and his own people.
('15', 142, 1, 24, 253044) I shall never forget while I live the pains he took to prepare himself for his meeting with Generals Botha and Smuts in Pretoria, the capital of South Africa.
('15', 142, 1, 25, 253203) On the day before the interview, he closely examined Mr. Kallenbach and me.
('15', 142, 1, 26, 253279) He got up at three oclock and woke us up.
('15', 142, 1, 27, 253321) He had finished with the literature he had been supplied and now wanted to cross examine me, in order to make sure whether he was fully prepared.
('15', 142, 1, 28, 253467) I told him politely that he need not have exerted himself so much, that we would fight it out if we obtained nothing then, but that we did not want him to be sacrificed for our sake.
('15', 142, 1, 29, 253650) But how would a man, who had made it a rule to throw himself

('15', 143, 1, 2, 253763) heart and soul into everything that he undertook, listen to my words?
('15', 143, 1, 3, 253833) How shall 1 describe his manner of cross examining [me]?
('15', 143, 1, 4, 253890) How shall I praise his thoroughness?
('15', 143, 1, 5, 253927) Such pains could have only one result.
('15', 143, 1, 6, 253966) The cabinet promised Mr. Gokhale that a Bill conceding the satyagrahis demands would be introduced in Parliament in the ensuing session and that the annual tax of 3 on the indentured labourers would be repealed.
('15', 143, 1, 7, 254178) The promises were not kept at the time mentioned.
('15', 143, 1, 8, 254228) Did Mr. Gokhale hold his peace thereafter?
('15', 143, 1, 9, 254271) Not for a moment.
('15', 143, 1, 10, 254289) I am sure his exertions in 1913 to secure the fulfilment of the promises must have shortened his life by at least ten years.
('15', 143, 1, 11, 254414) This is what his doctors believe.
('15', 143, 1, 12, 254448) It is difficult to give an idea of the labour he went through in that year in rousing India and collecting funds.
('15', 143, 1, 13, 254562) India was in an uproar about the issue of South Africa.
('15', 143, 1, 14, 254618) The power which brought this about was Mr. Gokhales.
('15', 143, 1, 15, 254671) Lord Hardinge made a speech in Madras 1 which will go down in history.
('15', 143, 1, 16, 254742) This too was owing to Gokhale.
('15', 143, 1, 17, 254773) Those who were the nearest to him bear witness that, worrying himself over the South African issue, he became permanently bed ridden.
('15', 143, 1, 18, 254907) Even so, till the very last he refused to rest.
('15', 143, 1, 19, 254955) He would receive, at midnight, telegrams from South Africa as long as letters.
('15', 143, 1, 20, 255034) He attended to them immediately and drafted a reply on the instant.
('15', 143, 1, 21, 255102) A telegram would be sent to Lord Hardinge the same moment and a statement for the Press prepared.
('15', 143, 1, 22, 255200) In attending to the question, he delayed his meal and delayed going to bed, ignored the difference between day and night.
('15', 143, 1, 23, 255322) Such single minded and selfless devotion would be possible only to an elevated soul.
('15', 143, 2, 24, 255407) On the Hindu Muslim question, too, his approach was ever the most religious.
('15', 143, 2, 25, 255484) Once a man dressed as a sadhu went to see him, claiming to speak for Hindus.
('15', 143, 2, 26, 255561) He would have the Muslims treated as
('15', 143, 3, 27, 255598) 1 Replying to addresses of welcome of the Mahajan Sabha and Madras Provincial Conference Committee at Madras on November 24, 1913, Lord Hardinge said: Recently your compatriots in South Africa have taken matters into their own hands by organising what is called passive resistance to laws which they consider invidious and unjustan opinion which we who watch their struggle from afar cannot but share.
('15', 143, 3, 28, 256000) They have violated as they intend to violate those laws with full knowledge of the penalties involved and ready with all courage and patience to endure those penalties.
('15', 143, 3, 29, 256169) In all this they have the sympathy of India deep and burning and not only of India but of all those who, like myself, without being Indians themselves, have feelings of sympathy for the people of this country. Vide Lord Hardinges Speech, 3 12 1913.
('15', 144, 0, 1, 256418) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 145
('15', 144, 1, 2, 256460) inferior and the Hindus as superior.
('15', 144, 1, 3, 256497) When Mr. Gokhale refused to play this game, he was accused of wanting in pride as a Hindu.
('15', 144, 1, 4, 256588) Knitting his brows, he replied in a voice that pierced the heart: If Hinduism consists in doing what you say, I am not a Hindu.
('15', 144, 1, 5, 256716) Please leave me. One sannyasi left another and walked off.
('15', 144, 1, 6, 256775) Mr. Gokhale possessed in an eminent degree the quality of fearlessness.
('15', 144, 1, 7, 256847) Among the qualities that make for the religious way of life this occupies almost the first place.
('15', 144, 1, 8, 256945) There was a reign of terror in Poona after the assassination of Lieutenant Rand 1. Mr. Gokhale was in England at that time.
('15', 144, 1, 9, 257069) He made a famous speech there in defence of Poona.
('15', 144, 1, 10, 257120) Some of the statements he made in that speech could not subsequently be proved.
('15', 144, 1, 11, 257200) After some time, he returned to India.
('15', 144, 1, 12, 257239) He apologized to the British troops against whom he had levelled charges.
('15', 144, 1, 13, 257313) This action even displeased a section of the Indian people.
('15', 144, 1, 14, 257373) Some persons advised the Mahatma to retire from public life.
('15', 144, 1, 15, 257434) A few ignorant Indians did not even hesitate to accuse him of pusillanimity.
('15', 144, 1, 16, 257511) To all of them, he replied in words at once earnest and gentle: What I have undertaken at no ones order, I can abandon at no ones order.
('15', 144, 1, 17, 257648) I should be happy to have popular opinion on my side while performing my duty; should I not be so fortunate, however, that too may be just as well. He believed that ones duty lay in working.
('15', 144, 1, 18, 257839) I never observed that while doing anything, he considered its effect on popular opinion from the point of view of his personal fortunes.
('15', 144, 1, 19, 257976) If it ever became necessary to mount the gallows for the sake of the country, I believe he had the strength to do so fearlessly and with a smile on his face.
('15', 144, 1, 20, 258134) I know that, often enough, mounting the gallows would have been a far easier thing for him than to be in the condition he had to pass through.
('15', 144, 1, 21, 258277) He was in such painful situations more than once but he never gave way.
('15', 144, 1, 22, 258349) All these instances would seem to point to this lesson, that if we would learn anything from the life of this great patriot, it should be to emulate his religious attitude.
('15', 144, 1, 23, 258522) All of us cannot go into the Central Legislative Assembly, nor do we always observe that doing so necessarily means serving the nation.
('15', 144, 1, 24, 258658) We all cannot join the Public Service Commission and all those who do are not patriots.
('15', 144, 1, 25, 258746) We may not, everyone of us, acquire his learning, nor do we see that every
('15', 144, 2, 26, 258821) 1 In 1897, W. C. Rand, I.C.S., and Lieutenant Ayerst were assassinated in Poona while on plague duty.
('15', 144, 2, 27, 258923) Damodar Hari Chapekar and his brother were tried and executed for the murder.

('15', 145, 1, 2, 259043) learned person is a servant of the country.
('15', 145, 1, 3, 259087) All of us, however, can cultivate virtues like fearlessness, truthfulness, fortitude, justice, straightforwardness, firmness of purpose, and dedicate them to the service of the nation.
('15', 145, 1, 4, 259272) This is the religious way.
('15', 145, 1, 5, 259299) This is what the mahavakya 1, that political life should be spiritualized, means.
('15', 145, 1, 6, 259381) He who follows this line will always know the path he should take.
('15', 145, 1, 7, 259448) He will earn a share in the legacy left by the late Shri Gokhale.
('15', 145, 1, 8, 259514) It is the divine assurance that anyone acting in this spirit will come by all the other gifts he needs.
('15', 145, 1, 9, 259618) The life of the late Shri Gokhale is an irrefutable proof of this.

('15', 146, 8, 19, 261190) February 5, 1916
('15', 146, 9, 20, 261207) YOUR HIGHNESS AND BROTHERS, I feel ashamed that before you I cannot speak well in Hindi.
('15', 146, 9, 21, 261296) You know that I used to live in South Africa.
('15', 146, 9, 22, 261342) It was there that I learnt a little Hindi while working with my Indian brethren.
('15', 146, 9, 23, 261423) You will therefore forgive me my failing.
('15', 146, 9, 24, 261465) I had not thought that I would have to speak at this gathering.
('15', 146, 9, 25, 261529) And I am not fit to deliver a speech.
('15', 146, 9, 26, 261567) I have been told to say something.
('15', 146, 9, 27, 261602) Although it is beyond my capacity to say much, I shall speak to you about a few things that come to my mind.
('15', 146, 9, 28, 261711) You are perhaps not aware that I have with me thirty to thirty five men and women.
('15', 146, 9, 29, 261794) They have taken a pledge to use Hindi.
('15', 146, 9, 30, 261833) I also corresponded with this body.
('15', 146, 9, 31, 261869) I was in need of some books which I could not get.
('15', 146, 9, 32, 261920) The Sabha has done something and I offer it my thanks and

('15', 147, 1, 2, 262093) congratulations and pray to God that it may increase its membership every day.
('15', 147, 1, 3, 262172) It should try to prepare the books that I wanted.
('15', 147, 1, 4, 262222) Its office holders are all M.A.s and B.A.s and LL.B.s and they have read those books in English.
('15', 147, 1, 5, 262319) From those of its office holders who are lawyers, I want to know whether they do their court work in English or in Hindi.
('15', 147, 1, 6, 262441) If they do it in English, I will say to them that they should do it in Hindi.
('15', 147, 1, 7, 262519) To those young men who are students, I will say that they should take a vow to use Hindi for writing letters to one another.
('15', 147, 1, 8, 262644) Freedom cannot be gained without literature.
('15', 147, 1, 9, 262689) People should therefore bring to the masses the advanced thoughts and new ideas that are available in English.
('15', 147, 1, 10, 262800) Tomorrow Dr. J. C. Bose will be making a speech.
('15', 147, 1, 11, 262849) If he speaks in Bengali, I will have no quarrel with him.
('15', 147, 1, 12, 262907) I will have a quarrel with him if he speaks in English.
('15', 147, 1, 13, 262963) It is the duty of the Nagari Pracharini Sabha to translate into Hindi the books that Dr. Bose has written in English.
('15', 147, 1, 14, 263081) When a learned book is published in Germany, the very next week it is translated into English.
('15', 147, 1, 15, 263176) That is why that language is so mature.
('15', 147, 1, 16, 263216) It should be the same with Hindi.
('15', 147, 1, 17, 263250) However much people may exalt their own language, real glory will belong only to the language which produces great scholars and that language alone will spread in the country.
('15', 147, 1, 18, 263426) If Tamil produces great scholars, we shall all begin to speak Tamil.
('15', 147, 1, 19, 263495) The language in which a poet like Tulsidas wrote his poetry is certainly sacred and no language can stand before it.
('15', 147, 1, 20, 263612) Our chief task is to learn Hindi, but even so we shall learn other languages also.
('15', 147, 1, 21, 263695) If we learn Tamil, we shall be able to teach Hindi to Tamil speakers also.

('15', 147, 4, 24, 263818) 123. SPEECH AT BENARES HINDU UNIVERSITY
('15', 147, 5, 25, 263858) February 6, 1916
('15', 147, 6, 26, 263875) The following is the full text of the speech delivered on February 4th 1 on the occasion of the opening of the Benares Hindu University.
('15', 147, 6, 27, 264012) Gandhiji, who edited the report for G. A. Natesan, wrote: I have merely removed some of the verbiage which in cold print would make the speech bad reading: Friends, I wish to tender my humble apology for the long delay

('15', 148, 1, 2, 264292) that took place before I was able to reach this place.
('15', 148, 1, 3, 264347) And you will readily accept the apology when I tell you that I am not responsible for the delay nor is any human agency responsible for it.
('15', 148, 1, 4, 264487) (Laughter.) The fact is that I am like an animal on show and lay keepers in their over kindness always manage to neglect a necessary chapter in this life and that is pure accident.
('15', 148, 1, 5, 264668) In this case, they did not provide for the series of accidents that happened to usto me, my keepers!
('15', 148, 1, 6, 264769) and my carriers.
('15', 148, 1, 7, 264786) Hence this delay.
('15', 148, 2, 8, 264804) Friends, under the influence of the matchless eloquence of the lady (Mrs. Besant) who has just sat down, pray, do not believe that our University has become a finished product and that all the young men who are to come to the University that has yet to rise and come into existence, have also come and returned from it finished citizens of a great empire.
('15', 148, 2, 9, 265160) Do not go away with any such impression and if you, the student world to which my remarks are supposed to be addressed this evening, consider for one moment that the spiritual life, for which this country is noted and for which this country has no rival, can be transmitted through the lip, pray, believe me you are wrong.
('15', 148, 2, 10, 265483) You will never be able merely through the lip to give the message that India, I hope, will one day deliver to the world.
('15', 148, 2, 11, 265604) I myself have been fed up with speeches and lectures.
('15', 148, 2, 12, 265658) I except the lectures that have been delivered here during the last two days from this category, because they were necessary.
('15', 148, 2, 13, 265784) But I do venture to suggest to you that we have now reached almost the end of our resources in speech making, and it is not enough that our ears are feasted, that our eyes are feasted, but it is necessary that our hearts have got to be touched and that our hands and feet have got to be moved.
('15', 148, 2, 14, 266078) We have been told during the last two days how necessary it is, if we are to retain our hold upon the simplicity of Indian character, that our hands and feet should move in unison with our hearts.
('15', 148, 2, 15, 266275) But this is only by way of preface, I wanted to say it is a matter of deep humiliation and shame for us that I am compelled this evening under the shadow of this great college, in this sacred city, to address my countrymen in a language that is foreign to me.
('15', 148, 2, 16, 266535) I know that if I was appointed an examiner to examine all those who have been attending during these two days this series of lectures most of those who might be examined upon these lectures would fail.
('15', 148, 2, 17, 266737) And why?
('15', 148, 2, 18, 266746) Because they have not been touched.
('15', 148, 2, 19, 266782) I was present at the
('15', 149, 0, 1, 266803) 150 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 149, 1, 2, 266845) sessions of the great Congress in the month of December.
('15', 149, 1, 3, 266902) There was a much vaster audience, and will you believe me when I tell you that the only speeches that touched that huge audience in Bombay were the speeches that were delivered in Hindustani?
('15', 149, 1, 4, 267094) In Bombay, mind you, not in Benares where everybody speaks Hindi.
('15', 149, 1, 5, 267160) But between the vernaculars of the Bombay Presidency on the one hand; and Hindi on the other, no such great dividing line exists as there does between English and the sister languages of India; and the Congress audience was better able to follow the speakers in Hindi.
('15', 149, 1, 6, 267429) I am hoping that this University will see to it that the youths who come to it will receive their instruction through the medium of their vernaculars.
('15', 149, 1, 7, 267580) Our language is the reflection of ourselves, and if you tell me that our languages are too poor to express the best thought, then I say that the sooner we are wiped out of existence, the better for us.
('15', 149, 1, 8, 267782) Is there a man who dreams that English can ever become the national language of India?
('15', 149, 1, 9, 267869) (Cries of Never.) Why this handicap on the nation?
('15', 149, 1, 10, 267920) Just consider for one moment what an unequal race our lads have to run with every English lad.
('15', 149, 1, 11, 268015) I had the privilege of a close conversation with some Poona professors.
('15', 149, 1, 12, 268087) They assured me that every Indian youth, because he reached his knowledge through the English language, lost at least six precious years of life.
('15', 149, 1, 13, 268233) Multiply that by the number of students turned out by our schools and colleges and find out for yourselves how many thousand years have been lost to the nation.
('15', 149, 1, 14, 268394) The charge against us is, that we have no initiative.
('15', 149, 1, 15, 268448) How can we have any if we are to devote the precious years of our life to themastery of a foreign tongue?
('15', 149, 1, 16, 268554) We fail in this attempt also.
('15', 149, 1, 17, 268584) Was it possible for any speaker yesterday and today to impress his audience as was possible for Mr. Higginbotham?
('15', 149, 1, 18, 268698) It was not the fault of the previous speakers that they could not engage the audience.
('15', 149, 1, 19, 268785) They had more than substance enough for us in their addresses.
('15', 149, 1, 20, 268848) But their addresses could not go home to us.
('15', 149, 1, 21, 268893) I have heard it said that after all it is English educated India which is leading and which is doing all the things for the nation.
('15', 149, 1, 22, 269025) It would be monstrous if it were otherwise.
('15', 149, 1, 23, 269069) The only education we receive is English education.
('15', 149, 1, 24, 269121) Surely we must show something for it.
('15', 149, 1, 25, 269159) But suppose that we had been receiving during the past fifty years education through our vernaculars, what should we have had today?
('15', 149, 1, 26, 269292) We should have today a free India, we should have our educated men,
('15', 150, 0, 1, 269360) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 151
('15', 150, 1, 2, 269402) not as if they were foreigners in their own land but speaking to the heart of the nation; they would be working amongst the poorest of the poor, and whatever they would have gained during the past 50 years would be a heritage for the nation.
('15', 150, 1, 3, 269644) (Applause.) Today even our wives are not the sharers in our best thought.
('15', 150, 1, 4, 269718) Look at Professor Bose 1 and Professor Ray 2 and their brilliant researches.
('15', 150, 1, 5, 269795) Is it not a shame that their researches are not the common property of the masses?
('15', 150, 1, 6, 269878) Let us now turn to another subject.
('15', 150, 1, 7, 269914) The Congress has passed a resolution about self government and I have no doubt that the All India Congress Committee and the Moslem League will do their duty and come forward with some tangible suggestions.
('15', 150, 1, 8, 270121) But I, for one, must frankly confess that I am not so much interested in what they will be able to produce as I am interested in anything that the student world is going to produce or the masses are going to produce.
('15', 150, 1, 9, 270338) No paper contribution will ever give us self government.
('15', 150, 1, 10, 270395) No amount of speeches will ever make us fit for self government.
('15', 150, 1, 11, 270460) It is only our conduct that will fit us for it.
('15', 150, 1, 12, 270508) (Applause.) And how are we trying to govern ourselves?
('15', 150, 1, 13, 270563) I want to think audibly this evening.
('15', 150, 1, 14, 270601) I do not want to make a speech and if you find me this evening speaking without reserve, pray, consider that you are only sharing the thoughts of a man who allows himself to think audibly, and if you think that I seem to transgress the limits that courtesy imposes upon me, pardon me for the liberty I may be taking.
('15', 150, 1, 15, 270918) I visited the Viswanath Temple last evening and as I was walking through those lanes, these were the thoughts that touched me.
('15', 150, 1, 16, 271045) If a stranger dropped from above on to this great temple and he had to consider what we as Hindus were, would he not be justified in condemning us?
('15', 150, 1, 17, 271193) Is not this great temple a reflection of our own character?
('15', 150, 1, 18, 271253) I speak feelingly as a Hindu.
('15', 150, 1, 19, 271283) Is it right that the lanes of our sacred temple should be as dirty as they are?
('15', 150, 1, 20, 271363) The houses round about are built anyhow.
('15', 150, 1, 21, 271404) The lanes are tortuous and narrow.
('15', 150, 1, 22, 271439) If even our temples are not models of roominess and cleanliness, what can our self government be?
('15', 150, 1, 23, 271537) Shall our temples be abodes of holiness, cleanliness and peace as soon as the English have retired from India, either of their own pleasure or by compulsion, bag and baggage?
('15', 150, 1, 24, 271712) I entirely agree with the President of the Congress that before we think of self government, we shall have to do the necessary plodding.
('15', 150, 1, 25, 271849) In every city there are two divisions, the cantonment and the city proper.
('15', 150, 1, 26, 271924) The city mostly is a stinking den.
('15', 150, 1, 27, 271959) But we are a people unused

('15', 151, 1, 2, 272088) to city life.
('15', 151, 1, 3, 272102) But if we want city life, we cannot reproduce the easy going hamlet life.
('15', 151, 1, 4, 272176) It is not comforting to think that people walk about the streets of Indian Bombay under the perpetual fear of dwellers in the storeyed buildings spitting upon them.
('15', 151, 1, 5, 272341) I do a great deal of railway travelling.
('15', 151, 1, 6, 272382) I observe the difficulty of third class passengers.
('15', 151, 1, 7, 272434) But the Railway Administration is by no means to blame for all their hard lot.
('15', 151, 1, 8, 272513) We do not know the elementary laws of cleanliness.
('15', 151, 1, 9, 272564) We spit anywhere on the carriage floor, irrespective of the thought that it is often used as sleeping space.
('15', 151, 1, 10, 272673) We do not trouble ourselves as to how we use it; the result is indescribable filth in the compartment.
('15', 151, 1, 11, 272776) The so called better class passengers over awe their less fortunate brethren.
('15', 151, 1, 12, 272854) Among them I have seen the student world also.
('15', 151, 1, 13, 272901) Sometimes they behave no better.
('15', 151, 1, 14, 272934) They can speak English and they have worn Norfolk Jackets and therefore claim the right to force their way in and command seating accommodation.
('15', 151, 1, 15, 273079) I have turned the searchlight all over and as you have given me the privilege of speaking to you, I am laying my heart bare.
('15', 151, 1, 16, 273204) Surely we must set these things right in our progress towards self government.
('15', 151, 1, 17, 273283) I now introduce you to another scene.
('15', 151, 1, 18, 273321) His Highness the Maharajah, who presided yesterday over our deliberations, spoke about the poverty of India.
('15', 151, 1, 19, 273430) Other speakers laid great stress upon it.
('15', 151, 1, 20, 273472) But what did we witness in the great pandalin which the foundation ceremony was performed by the Viceroy?
('15', 151, 1, 21, 273578) Certainly a most gorgeous show, an exhibition of jewellery which made a splendid feast for the eyes of the greatest jeweller who chose to come from Paris.
('15', 151, 1, 22, 273733) I compare with the richly bedecked noblemen the millions of the poor.
('15', 151, 1, 23, 273803) And I feel like saying to these noblemen: Thereis no salvation for India unless you strip yourselves of this jewellery and hold it in trust for your countrymen in India. (Hear, hear and applause.) I am sure it is not the desire of the King Emperor or Lord Hardinge that in order to show the truest loyalty to our King Emperor, it is necessary for us to ransack our jewellery boxes and to appear bedecked from top to toe.
('15', 151, 1, 24, 274224) I would undertake at the peril of my life to bring to you a message from King George himself that he expects nothing of the kind.
('15', 151, 1, 25, 274354) Sir, whenever I hear of a great palace rising in any great city of India, be it in British India or be it in India which is ruled by our great chiefs, I become jealous at once and I say: Oh, it is the money that has come from the agriculturists. Over 75 per cent of the population are agriculturists and Mr. Higginbotham told us last night in his own felicitous language that they are the men who grow two blades of grass in the place of one.
('15', 151, 1, 26, 274797) But there cannot be much spirit of self government about us if we take away or allow others to take away from them almost the whole of the results of their labour.
('15', 151, 1, 27, 274961) Our salvation can only

('15', 152, 1, 2, 275026) come through the farmer.
('15', 152, 1, 3, 275051) Neither the lawyers, nor the doctors, nor the rich landlords are going to secure it.
('15', 152, 2, 4, 275136) Now, last but not the least, it is my bounden duty to refer to what agitated our minds during these two or three days.
('15', 152, 2, 5, 275255) All of us have had many anxious moments while the Viceroy was going through the streets of Benares.
('15', 152, 2, 6, 275355) There were detectives stationed in many places.
('15', 152, 2, 7, 275403) We were horrified.
('15', 152, 2, 8, 275422) We asked ourselves: Why this distrust?
('15', 152, 2, 9, 275461) Is it not better that even Lord Hardinge should die than live a living death? But a representative of a mighty Sovereign may not.
('15', 152, 2, 10, 275591) He might find it necessary even to live a living death.
('15', 152, 2, 11, 275647) But why was it necessary to impose these detectives on us?
('15', 152, 2, 12, 275706) We may foam, we may fret, we may resent but let us not forget that India of today in her impatience has produced an army of anarchists.
('15', 152, 2, 13, 275842) I myself am an anarchist, but of another type.
('15', 152, 2, 14, 275889) But there is a class of anarchists amongst us, and if I was able to reach this class, I would say to them that their anarchism has no room in India if India is to conquer the conqueror.
('15', 152, 2, 15, 276075) It is a sign of fear.
('15', 152, 2, 16, 276097) If we trust and fear God, we shall have to fear no one, not Maharajahs, not Viceroys, not the detectives, not even King George.
('15', 152, 2, 17, 276225) I honour the anarchist for his love of the country.
('15', 152, 2, 18, 276277) I honour him for his bravery in being willing to die for his country; but I ask him: Is killing honourable?
('15', 152, 2, 19, 276385) Is the dagger of an assassin a fit precursor of an honourable death?
('15', 152, 2, 20, 276454) I deny it.
('15', 152, 2, 21, 276465) There is no warrant for such methods in any scriptures.
('15', 152, 2, 22, 276521) If I found it necessary for the salvation of India that the English should retire, that they should be driven out, I would not hesitate to declare that they would have to go, and I hope I would be prepared to die in defence of that belief.
('15', 152, 2, 23, 276761) That would, in my opinion, be an honourable death.
('15', 152, 2, 24, 276812) The bomb thrower creates secret plots, is afraid to come into the open, and when caught pays the penalty of misdirected zeal.
('15', 152, 2, 25, 276938) I have been told: Had we not done this, had some people not thrown bombs, we should never have gained what we have got with reference to the partition movement 1. (Mrs. Besant: Please stop it.) This was what I said 2 in Bengal when Mr. Lyons presided at the meeting.
('15', 152, 2, 26, 277205) I think what I am saying is necessary.
('15', 152, 2, 27, 277244) If I am told to stop, I shall obey.
('15', 152, 2, 28, 277280) (Turning to the Chairman) I await your orders.
('15', 152, 2, 29, 277327) If you consider that by my speaking as I am, I am not serving the country and the Empire, I shall certainly stop.
('15', 152, 2, 30, 277441) (Cries of Go on.) (The

('15', 153, 1, 2, 277644) Chairman: Please explain your object.) I am explaining my object.
('15', 153, 1, 3, 277710) 1 am simply (Another interruption.) My friends, please do not resent this interruption.
('15', 153, 1, 4, 277798) If Mrs. Besant this evening suggests that I should stop, she does so because she loves India so well, and she considers that I am erring in thinking audibly before you young men.
('15', 153, 1, 5, 277977) But even so, I simply say this that I want to purge India of the atmosphere of suspicion on either side; if we are to reach our goal, we should have an empire which is to be based upon mutual love and mutual trust.
('15', 153, 1, 6, 278192) Is it not better that we talk under the shadow of this college than that we should be talking irresponsibly in our homes?
('15', 153, 1, 7, 278314) I consider that it is much better that we talk these things openly.
('15', 153, 1, 8, 278382) I have done so with excellent results before now.
('15', 153, 1, 9, 278432) I know that there is nothing that the students are not discussing.
('15', 153, 1, 10, 278499) There is nothing that the students do not know.
('15', 153, 1, 11, 278547) I am therefore turning the searchlight towards ourselves.
('15', 153, 1, 12, 278605) I hold the name of my country so dear to me that I exchange these thoughts with you and submit to you that there is no reason for anarchism in India.
('15', 153, 1, 13, 278755) Let us frankly and openly say whatever we want to say to our rulers and face the consequences if what we have to say does not please them.
('15', 153, 1, 14, 278894) But let us not abuse.
('15', 153, 1, 15, 278916) I was talking the other day to a member of the much abused Civil Service.
('15', 153, 1, 16, 278990) I have not very much in common with the members of that Service, but I could not help admiring the manner in which he was speaking to me.
('15', 153, 1, 17, 279128) He said: Mr. Gandhi, do you for one moment suppose that all we, Civil Servants, are a bad lot, that we want to oppress the people whom we have come to govern? No, I said.
('15', 153, 1, 18, 279299) Then, if you get an opportunity, put in a word for the much abused Civil Service., And I am here to put in that word.
('15', 153, 1, 19, 279417) Yes, many members of the Indian Civil Service are most decidedly overbearing, they are tyrannical, at times thoughtless.
('15', 153, 1, 20, 279538) Many other adjectives may be used.
('15', 153, 1, 21, 279573) I grant all these things and I grant also that after having lived in India for a certain number of years, some of them become somewhat degraded.
('15', 153, 1, 22, 279718) But what does that signify?
('15', 153, 1, 23, 279746) They were gentlemen before they came here, and if they have lost some of the moral fibre, it is a reflection upon ourselves.
('15', 153, 1, 24, 279871) (Cries of No.) Just think out for yourselves, if a man who was good yesterday has become bad after having come in contact with me, is he responsible that he has deteriorated or am I?
('15', 153, 1, 25, 280054) The atmosphere of sycophancy and falsity that surrounds them on their coming to India demoralises them as it would many of us.
('15', 153, 1, 26, 280181) It is well to take the blame sometimes.
('15', 153, 1, 27, 280221) If we are to receive self government, we shall have to take it.
('15', 153, 1, 28, 280285) We shall never be granted self government.
('15', 153, 1, 29, 280328) Look at the history of the British Empire

('15', 154, 1, 2, 280412) and the British nation; freedom loving as it is, it will not be a party to give freedom to a people who will not take it themselves.
('15', 154, 1, 3, 280545) Learn your lesson if you wish to from the Boer War.

('15', 154, 5, 8, 280925) February 7, 1916
('15', 154, 6, 9, 280942) Speaking last night at one of the lectures inaugurated in connection with the University week in Benares, Mr. Gandhi referred to the precautions taken by the authorities to protect the Viceroy while he was in Benares.
('15', 154, 6, 10, 281160) Mr. Gandhi was asked to explain briefly what he was about to say.
('15', 154, 6, 11, 281226) Eventually all the princes present left in a body, and, though Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya 2 explained that what Mr. Gandhi meant was that it was a shame to themselves that such a course was thought necessary because of the misdeeds of a few misguided youths, the meeting dispersed at once.
('15', 154, 7, 12, 281517) Mr. Gandhi, today, wrote a letter of explanation to the Maharaja of Darbhanga 3 in which, after expressing his regret at last nights incident, he says: My sole object in referring to the Viceregal visit was to express the very strong views I hold against all acts of violence and so called anarchy.
('15', 154, 7, 13, 281816) In common with most of us, I felt deeply humiliated that extraordinary precautions should have been rendered necessary for the protection of the person of one of the noblest of Viceroys when he was, in a special sense, our honoured guest in this sacred city.
('15', 154, 7, 14, 282075) My mission in life is to preach and assist in securing the utmost freedom for my country but never by violence to the person of any human being, even under the greatest provocation.

('15', 156, 2, 3, 283987) February 9, 1916
('15', 156, 3, 4, 284004) Mr. Gandhi, who arrived in Bombay yesterday afternoon from Benares, being interviewed about the incident which interrupted his speech at Benares, said that he was unable to say what particular remarks of his were objected to, nor did Mrs. Besant point out any such remarks.
('15', 156, 3, 5, 284278) She only appealed to the Chairman to stop him.
('15', 156, 3, 6, 284325) Mr. Gandhi said his speech that evening was practically a repetition, in so far as it related to anarchism, of what he had said 1 at the Calcutta meeting last year of which the Hon.
('15', 156, 3, 7, 284507) Mr. Lyons was Chairman.
('15', 156, 3, 8, 284531) At this point, the audience wanted the speaker to go on, but Mr. Gandhi said that he would not do so unless he received the Chairmans permission to continue.
('15', 156, 3, 9, 284689) He also asked the audience not to resent, as it was inclined, Mrs. Besants interruption, as anybody who might feel aggrieved against the speakers remarks had a right to ask for a ruling from the Chair.
('15', 156, 4, 10, 284891) Continuing, Mr. Gandhi said: And I proceeded with my speech only after the Maharaja of Darbhangas permission, which he gave after considering the matter for a while and cautioning me to explain matters briefly.
('15', 156, 4, 11, 285102) I proceeded, but still noticed a stir on the platform, and that Mrs. Besant was whispering to the Princes who were sitting near her that I was neither withdrawing nor explaining and saying that they ought not to stay.
('15', 156, 5, 12, 285320) The next thing I observed was that the Princes rose one after another and as the Chairman also left, I could not finish my speech.
('15', 156, 6, 13, 285451) In reply to a question whether he would like to withdraw any of the remarks he had made at the meeting, Mr. Gandhi emphatically declared that every word was well considered and well weighed.
('15', 156, 6, 14, 285642) Continuing, he said: That I could ever endorse methods of violence is unthinkable.
('15', 156, 6, 15, 285725) I was not eager to speak at all.
('15', 156, 6, 16, 285758) I did so under great pressure from friends, as I was credited with having some influence over the student population of the country.
('15', 156, 6, 17, 285891) I was asked to speak about the violence which has unfortunately been the creed of some impulsive youths, owing to which we had to witness the humiliating spectacle of extraordinary precautions having to be taken for the protection of the

('15', 157, 1, 3, 286478) Throughout the whole of my remarks, there was not a word of endorsement of violent deeds.
('15', 157, 1, 4, 286568) I did give the misguided youths credit for patriotic motives, but I showed that the action was all the worthier of condemnation, in that it did irreparable harm in the long run.
('15', 157, 1, 5, 286746) In fact, the whole of my speech was intended to direct the searchlight towards ourselves and to show that for many of our difficulties, we were alone responsible.
('15', 157, 1, 6, 286909) It is my firm belief that, but for Mrs. Besants hasty and ill conceived interruption, nothing would have happened and my speech in its completed state would have left no room for any doubt as to my meaning.
('15', 157, 2, 7, 287116) Questioned as to whether it was a fact that the Hon.
('15', 157, 2, 8, 287169) Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya apologised to the meeting after the incident had occurred, Mr. Gandhi replied: Mr. Malaviya did address the meeting.
('15', 157, 2, 9, 287314) But I could trace no apology in his remarks.
('15', 157, 2, 10, 287359) He merely said that I had spoken at his special request and my sole intention was to show how suicidal methods of violence were.

('15', 157, 5, 13, 287579) February 14, 1916
('15', 157, 6, 14, 287597) It was not without much diffidence that I undertook to speak to you at all.
('15', 157, 6, 15, 287673) And I was hard put to it in the selection of my subject.
('15', 157, 6, 16, 287730) I have chosen a very delicate and difficult subject.
('15', 157, 6, 17, 287783) It is delicate because of the peculiar views I hold upon swadeshi, and it is difficult because I have not that command of language which is necessary for giving adequate expression to my thoughts.
('15', 157, 6, 18, 287980) I know that I may rely upon your indulgence for the many shortcomings you will no doubt find in my address, the more so when I tell you that there is nothing in what I am about to say, that I am not either already practising or am not preparing to practise to the best of my ability.
('15', 157, 6, 19, 288264) It encourages me to observe that last month you devoted a week to prayer in the place of an address.
('15', 157, 6, 20, 288365) I have earnestly prayed that what I am about to say may bear fruit and I know that you will bless my words with a similar

('15', 158, 1, 2, 288609) prayer.
('15', 158, 1, 3, 288617) After much thinking, I have arrived at a definition of swadeshi that perhaps best illustrates my meaning.
('15', 158, 1, 4, 288723) Swadeshi is that spirit in us which restricts us to the use and service of our immediate surroundings to the exclusion of the more remote.
('15', 158, 1, 5, 288862) Thus, as for religion, in order to satisfy the requirements of the definition, I must restrict myself to my ancestral religion.
('15', 158, 1, 6, 288990) That is the use of my immediate religious surroundings.
('15', 158, 1, 7, 289046) If I find it defective, I should serve it by purging it of its defects.
('15', 158, 1, 8, 289118) In the domain of politics, I should make use of the indigenous institutions and serve them by curing them of their proved defects.
('15', 158, 1, 9, 289249) In that of economics, I should use only things that are produced by my immediate neighbours and serve those industries by making them efficient and complete where they might be found wanting.
('15', 158, 1, 10, 289441) It is suggested that such swadeshi, if reduced to practice, will lead to the millennium.
('15', 158, 1, 11, 289530) And as we do not abandon our pursuit after the millennium because we do not expect quite to reach it within our time, so may we not abandon swadeshi even though it may not be fully attained for generations to come.
('15', 158, 1, 12, 289745) Let us briefly examine three branches of Swadeshi as sketched above.
('15', 158, 1, 13, 289814) Hinduism has become a conservative religion and therefore a mighty force because of the Swadeshi spirit underlying it.
('15', 158, 1, 14, 289933) It is the most tolerant because it is non proselytising, and it is as capable of expansion today as it has been found to be in the past.
('15', 158, 1, 15, 290070) It has succeeded not in driving, as I think it has been erroneously held, but in absorbing Buddhism.
('15', 158, 1, 16, 290171) By reason of the swadeshi spirit, a Hindu refuses to change his religion not necessarily because he considers it to be the best, but because he knows that he can complement it by introducing reforms.
('15', 158, 1, 17, 290371) And what I have said about Hinduism is, I suppose, true of the other great faiths of the world, only it is held that it is specially so in the case of Hinduism.
('15', 158, 1, 18, 290532) But here comes the point I am labouring to reach.
('15', 158, 1, 19, 290582) If there is any substance in what I have said, will not the great missionary bodies of India, to whom she owes a deep debt of gratitude for what they have done and are doing, do still better and serve the spirit of Christianity better, by dropping the goal of proselytising but continuing their philanthropic work?
('15', 158, 1, 20, 290897) I hope you will not consider this to be an impertinence on my part.
('15', 158, 1, 21, 290965) I make the suggestion in all sincerity and with due humility.
('15', 158, 1, 22, 291027) Moreover, I have some claim upon your attention.
('15', 158, 1, 23, 291076) I have endeavoured to study the Bible.
('15', 158, 1, 24, 291115) I consider it as part of my scriptures.
('15', 158, 1, 25, 291155) The spirit of the Sermon
('15', 159, 0, 1, 291180) 160 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 159, 1, 2, 291222) on the Mount competes almost on equal terms with the Bhagavad Gita for the domination of my heart.
('15', 159, 1, 3, 291321) I yield to no Christian in the strength of devotion with which I sing, Lead, kindly Light and several other inspired hymns of a similar nature.
('15', 159, 1, 4, 291465) I have come under the influence of noted Christian missionaries belonging to different denominations.
('15', 159, 1, 5, 291567) And I enjoy to this day the privilege of friendship with some of them.
('15', 159, 1, 6, 291638) You will perhaps therefore allow that I have offered the above suggestion not as a biased Hindu but as a humble and impartial student of religion with great leanings towards Christianity.
('15', 159, 1, 7, 291826) May it not be that the Go Ye unto All the World message has been somewhat narrowly interpreted and the spirit of it missed?
('15', 159, 1, 8, 291950) It will not be denied, I speak from experience, that many of the conversions are only so called.
('15', 159, 1, 9, 292047) In some cases, the appeal has gone not to the heart but to the stomach.
('15', 159, 1, 10, 292119) And in every case, a conversion leaves a sore behind it which, I venture to think, is avoidable.
('15', 159, 1, 11, 292216) Quoting again from experience, a new birth, a change of heart, is perfectly possible in every one of the great faiths.
('15', 159, 1, 12, 292335) I know I am now treading upon thin ice.
('15', 159, 1, 13, 292375) But I do not apologise, in closing this part of my subject, for saving that the frightful outrage that is just going on in Europe, perhaps, shows that the message of Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of Peace, has been little understood in Europe, and that light upon it may have to be thrown from the East.
('15', 159, 1, 14, 292676) I have sought your help in religious matters, which it is yours to give in a special sense.
('15', 159, 1, 15, 292768) But I make bold to seek it even in political matters.
('15', 159, 1, 16, 292822) I do not believe that religion has nothing to do with politics.
('15', 159, 1, 17, 292886) The latter divorced from religion is like a corpse only fit to be buried.
('15', 159, 1, 18, 292960) As a matter of fact, in your own silent manner, you influence politics not a little.
('15', 159, 1, 19, 293045) And I feel that if the attempt to separate politics from religion had not been made, as it is even now made, they would not have degenerated, as they often appear to do.
('15', 159, 1, 20, 293215) No one considers that the political life of the country is in a happy state.
('15', 159, 1, 21, 293292) Following out the swadeshi spirit, I observe the indigenous institutions and the village panchayats hold me.
('15', 159, 1, 22, 293401) India is really a republican country, and it is because it is that that it has survived every shock hitherto delivered.
('15', 159, 1, 23, 293521) Princes and potentates, whether they were Indian born or foreigners, have hardly touched the vast masses except for collecting revenue.
('15', 159, 1, 24, 293657) The latter in their turn seem to have rendered unto Caesar what was Caesars and for the rest have done much as they have liked.
('15', 159, 1, 25, 293785) The vast organisation of caste answered not only the religious wants of the community, but it answered too its political needs.
('15', 159, 1, 26, 293913) The villagers

('15', 160, 1, 2, 293969) managed their internal affairs through the caste system, and through it they dealt with any oppression from the ruling power or powers.
('15', 160, 1, 3, 294105) It is not possible to deny of a nation that was capable of producing the caste system its wonderful power of organisation.
('15', 160, 1, 4, 294228) One had but to attend the great Kumbha Mela at Hardwar last year to know how skilful that organisation must have been, which without any seeming effort, was able effectively to cater for more than a million pilgrims.
('15', 160, 1, 5, 294445) Yet is it the fashion to say that we lack organising ability.
('15', 160, 1, 6, 294507) This is true, I fear, to a certain extent, of those who have been nurtured in the new traditions.
('15', 160, 1, 7, 294605) We have laboured under a terrible handicap owing to an almost fatal departure from the swadeshi spirit.
('15', 160, 1, 8, 294709) We the educated classes have received our education through a foreign tongue.
('15', 160, 1, 9, 294787) We have therefore not reacted upon the masses.
('15', 160, 1, 10, 294834) We want to represent the masses, but we fail.
('15', 160, 1, 11, 294880) They recognise us not much more than they recognise the English officers.
('15', 160, 1, 12, 294954) Their hearts are an open book to neither.
('15', 160, 1, 13, 294996) Their aspirations are not ours.
('15', 160, 1, 14, 295028) Hence there is a break.
('15', 160, 1, 15, 295052) And you witness not in reality failure to organise, but want of correspondence between the representatives and the represented.
('15', 160, 1, 16, 295180) If during the last fifty years we had been educated through the vernaculars, our elders and our servants and our neighbours would have partaken of our knowledge; the discoveries of a Bose or a Ray would have been household treasure as are the Ramayan and the Mahabharat.
('15', 160, 1, 17, 295451) As it is, so far as the masses are concerned, those great discoveries might as well have been made by foreigners.
('15', 160, 1, 18, 295565) Had instruction in all the branches of learning been given through the vernaculars, I make bold to say that they would have been enriched wonderfully.
('15', 160, 1, 19, 295716) The question of village sanitation, etc., would have been solved long ago.
('15', 160, 1, 20, 295791) The village panchayats would be now a living force in a special way, and India would almost be enjoying self government suited to its requirements and would have been spared the humiliating spectacle of organised assassination on its sacred soil.
('15', 160, 1, 21, 296038) It is not too late to mend.
('15', 160, 1, 22, 296066) And you can help if you will, as no other body or bodies can.
('15', 160, 1, 23, 296128) And now for the last division of swadeshi.
('15', 160, 1, 24, 296171) Much of the deep poverty of the masses is due to the ruinous departure from swadeshi in the economic and industrial life.
('15', 160, 1, 25, 296293) If not an article of commerce had been brought from outside India, she would be today a land flowing with milk and honey.
('15', 160, 1, 26, 296415) But that was not to be.
('15', 160, 1, 27, 296439) We were greedy and so was England.
('15', 160, 1, 28, 296474) The connection between England and India was based clearly upon an error.
('15', 160, 1, 29, 296548) But she (England) does not remain in India in
('15', 161, 0, 1, 296594) 162 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 161, 1, 2, 296636) It is her declared policy that India is to be held in trust for her people.
('15', 161, 1, 3, 296712) If this be true, Lancashire must stand aside.
('15', 161, 1, 4, 296758) And if the swadeshi doctrine is a sound doctrine, Lancashire can stand aside without hurt, though it may sustain a shock for the time being.
('15', 161, 1, 5, 296899) I think of swadeshi not as a boycott movement undertaken by way of revenge.
('15', 161, 1, 6, 296975) I conceive it as a religious principle to be followed by all.
('15', 161, 1, 7, 297037) I am no economist, but I have read some treatises which show that England could easily become a self sustained country, growing all the produce she needs.
('15', 161, 1, 8, 297192) This may be an utterly ridiculous proposition, and perhaps the best proof that it cannot be true is that England is one of the largest importers in the world.
('15', 161, 1, 9, 297351) But India cannot live for Lancashire or any other country before she is able to live for herself.
('15', 161, 1, 10, 297449) And she can live for herself only if she produces and is helped to produce everything for her requirements within her own borders.
('15', 161, 1, 11, 297580) She need not be, she ought not to be, drawn into the vortex of mad and ruinous competition which breeds fratricide, jealousy and many other evils.
('15', 161, 1, 12, 297727) But who is to stop her great millionaires from entering into the world competition?
('15', 161, 1, 13, 297811) Certainly, not legislation.
('15', 161, 1, 14, 297839) Force of public opinion, proper education, however, can do a great deal in the desired direction.
('15', 161, 1, 15, 297937) The handloom industry is in a dying condition.
('15', 161, 1, 16, 297984) I took special care during my wanderings last year to see as many weavers as possible, and my heart ached to find how they had lost, how families had retired from this once flourishing and honourable occupation.
('15', 161, 1, 17, 298196) If we follow the swadeshi doctrine, it would be your duty and mine to find out neighbours who can supply our wants and to teach them to supply them where they do not know how to, assuming that there are neighbours who are in want of healthy occupation.
('15', 161, 1, 18, 298449) Then every village of India will almost be a self supporting and self contained unit exchanging only such necessary commodities with other villages where they are not locally producible.
('15', 161, 1, 19, 298636) This may all sound nonsensical.
('15', 161, 1, 20, 298668) Well, India is a country of nonsense.
('15', 161, 1, 21, 298706) It is nonsensical to parch ones throat with thirst when a kindly Mahomedan is ready to offer pure water to drink.
('15', 161, 1, 22, 298820) And yet thousands of Hindus would rather die of thirst than drink water from a Mahomedan household.
('15', 161, 1, 23, 298920) These nonsensical men can also, once they are convinced that their religion demands that they should wear garments manufactured in India only and eat food only grown in India, decline to wear any other clothing or eat any other food.
('15', 161, 1, 24, 299154) Lord Curzon set the fashion for tea drinking.
('15', 161, 1, 25, 299200) And that pernicious drug now bids fair to overwhelm the nation.
('15', 161, 1, 26, 299264) It has already undermined the digestive apparatus of hundreds of thousands

('15', 162, 1, 2, 299381) of men and women and constitutes an additional tax upon their slender purses.
('15', 162, 1, 3, 299459) Lord Hardinge can set the fashion for swadeshi and almost the whole of India will foreswear foreign goods.
('15', 162, 1, 4, 299566) There is a verse in the Bhagavad Gita, which, freely rendered, means masses follow the classes.
('15', 162, 1, 5, 299662) It is easy to undo the evil if the thinking portion of the community were to take the swadeshi vow even though it may for a time cause considerable inconvenience.
('15', 162, 1, 6, 299825) I hate interference in any department of life.
('15', 162, 1, 7, 299872) At best, it is the lesser evil.
('15', 162, 1, 8, 299904) But I would tolerate, welcome, indeed plead for, stiff protective duty upon foreign goods.
('15', 162, 1, 9, 299995) Natal, a British colony, protected its sugar by taxing the sugar that came from another British colony, Mauritius.
('15', 162, 1, 10, 300110) England has sinned against India by forcing free trade upon her.
('15', 162, 1, 11, 300175) It may have been food for her, but it has been poison for this country.
('15', 162, 2, 12, 300247) It has often been urged that India cannot adopt swadeshi in the economic life at any rate.
('15', 162, 2, 13, 300338) Those who advance this objection do not look upon swadeshi as a rule of life.
('15', 162, 2, 14, 300416) With them, it is a mere patriotic effort not to be made if it involved any self denial.
('15', 162, 2, 15, 300504) Swadeshi, as defined here, is a religious discipline to be undergone in utter disregard of the physical discomfort it may cause to individuals.
('15', 162, 2, 16, 300648) Under its spell, the deprivation of pin or a needle, because these are not manufactured in India need cause no terror.
('15', 162, 2, 17, 300767) A swadeshi will learn to do without hundreds of things which today he considers necessary.
('15', 162, 2, 18, 300858) Moreover, those who dismiss swadeshi from their minds by arguing the impossible forget that swadeshi, after all, is a goal to be reached by steady effort.
('15', 162, 2, 19, 301013) And we would be making for the goal even if we confined swadeshi to a given set of articles, allowing ourselves as a temporary measure to use such things as might not be procurable in the country.
('15', 162, 3, 20, 301210) There now remains for me to consider one more objection that has been raised against swadeshi.
('15', 162, 3, 21, 301305) The objectors consider it to be a most selfish doctrine without any warrant in the civilized code of morality.
('15', 162, 3, 22, 301416) With them, to practise Swadeshi is to revert to barbarism.
('15', 162, 3, 23, 301475) I cannot enter into a detailed analysis of the proposition.
('15', 162, 3, 24, 301535) But I would urge that Swadeshi is the only doctrine consistent with the law of humility and love.
('15', 162, 3, 25, 301633) It is arrogance to think of launching out to serve the whole of India when I am hardly able to serve even my own family.
('15', 162, 3, 26, 301754) It were better to concentrate my effort upon the family and consider that through them I was serving the whole nation and, if you will, the whole of humanity.
('15', 162, 3, 27, 301913) This is humility and it is love.
('15', 162, 3, 28, 301946) The motive
('15', 163, 0, 1, 301957) 164 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 163, 1, 2, 301999) will determine the quality of the act.
('15', 163, 1, 3, 302038) I may serve my family regardless of the sufferings I may cause to others, as, for instance, I may accept an employment which enables me to extort money from people.
('15', 163, 1, 4, 302203) I enrich myself thereby and then satisfy many unlawful demands of the family.
('15', 163, 1, 5, 302281) Here I am neither serving the family nor the State.
('15', 163, 1, 6, 302333) Or I may recognise that God has given me hands and feet only to work with for my sustenance and for that of those who may be dependent upon me.
('15', 163, 1, 7, 302477) I would then at once simplify my life and that of those whom I can directly reach.
('15', 163, 1, 8, 302560) In this instance, I would have served the family without causing injury to anyone else.
('15', 163, 1, 9, 302648) Supposing that everyone followed this mode of life, we would have at once an ideal State.
('15', 163, 1, 10, 302738) All will not reach that state at the same time.
('15', 163, 1, 11, 302786) But those of us who, realising its truth, enforce it in practice will clearly anticipate and accelerate the coming of that happy day.
('15', 163, 1, 12, 302920) Under this plan of life, in seeming to serve India to the exclusion of every other country, I do not harm any other country.
('15', 163, 1, 13, 303045) My patriotism is both exclusive and inclusive.
('15', 163, 1, 14, 303092) It is exclusive in the sense that in all humility I confine my attention to the land of my birth, but it is inclusive in the sense that my service is not of a competitive or antagonistic nature.
('15', 163, 1, 15, 303287) Sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas 1 is not merely a legal maxim, but it is a grand doctrine of life.
('15', 163, 1, 16, 303390) It is the key to a proper practice of ahimsa or love.
('15', 163, 1, 17, 303444) It is for you, the custodians of a great faith, to set the fashion and show by your preaching, sanctified by practice, that patriotism based on hatred killeth and that patriotism based on love giveth life.

('15', 164, 2, 3, 303907) February 16, 1916
('15', 164, 3, 4, 303925) MR. CHAIRMAN AND DEAR FRIENDS, I have so often said that I am not myself fond of hearing my own voice and I assure you that this morning also I retained the same position.
('15', 164, 3, 5, 304097) It was only, if you will believe me, my great regard for the students, whom I love, whom I respect and who I consider are the hope of future India that moved me to accept this invitation to speak to you this morning.
('15', 164, 3, 6, 304314) I did not know what subject to choose.
('15', 164, 3, 7, 304353) A friend has handed me a slip here asking me whether I would enlighten the students on the Benares incident.
('15', 164, 3, 8, 304462) (Hear, hear.) I fear I shall have to disappoint that friend and those of you who associate yourselves with that view.
('15', 164, 3, 9, 304580) I dont think that you need lay any stress upon that incident.
('15', 164, 3, 10, 304642) These are the passing waves which will always come and go.
('15', 164, 3, 11, 304701) I should therefore this morning fear rather if I can possibly do so and pour my soul out to you with reference to something which I treasure so much above everything else.
('15', 164, 4, 12, 304873) To many of the students who came here last year to converse with me, I said 3 I was about to establish an institutionan Ashram somewhere in India, and it is about that place that I am going to talk to you this morning.
('15', 164, 4, 13, 305092) I feel and I have felt during the whole of my public life that what we need, what any nation needs, but we perhaps of all the nations of the world need just now, is nothing else and nothing less than character building.
('15', 164, 4, 14, 305312) And this is the view propounded by that great patriot, Mr. Gokhale.
('15', 164, 4, 15, 305380) (Cheers.) As you know, in many of his speeches, he used to say that we would get nothing, we would deserve nothing unless we had character to back what we wished for.
('15', 164, 5, 16, 305547) 1 With Rev.
('15', 164, 5, 17, 305559) George Pittendrigh of the Madras Christian College in the chair.
('15', 164, 5, 18, 305624) This was published with the following note by the Editor, Indian Review: We have received several enquiries from our readers regarding Mr. Gandhis new organisation, the Satyagrahashram.
('15', 164, 5, 19, 305810) We are glad to be able to give the following account of the Ashram from a special report of the speech that Mr. Gandhi delivered sometime ago in Madras.
('15', 164, 5, 20, 305963) The report has since had the benefit of Mr. Gandhis revision and may, therefore, be taken as an authoritative exposition of the aims and objects of Mr. Gandhis Satyagrahashram.
('15', 164, 5, 21, 306140) 2 This paragraph is from The Hindu, 16 2 1916.
('15', 164, 6, 22, 306187) 3 Vide Speech at Gokhale Club, Madras, 20 4 1915.
('15', 165, 0, 1, 306237) 166 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 165, 1, 2, 306279) Hence his founding of that great body, the Servants of India Society.
('15', 165, 1, 3, 306349) And as you know, in the prospectus that has been issued in connection with the Society, Mr. Gokhale has deliberately stated that it was necessary to spiritualise the political life of the country.
('15', 165, 1, 4, 306546) You know also that he used to say so often that our average was less than the average of so many European nations.
('15', 165, 1, 5, 306661) I do not know whether that statement by him, whom, with pride, I consider to be my political guru, has really foundation in fact, but I do believe that there is much to be said to justify it in so far as educated India is concerned ; not because we, the educated portion of the community, have blundered, but because we have been creatures of circumstances.
('15', 165, 1, 6, 307019) Be that as it may, this is the maxim of life which I have accepted, namely, that no work done by any man, no matter how great he is, will really prosper unless he 1 has a religious backing.
('15', 165, 1, 7, 307209) But what is religion?
('15', 165, 1, 8, 307231) the question will be immediately asked.
('15', 165, 1, 9, 307271) I, for one, would answer, not the religion which you will get after reading all the scriptures of the world; it is not really a grasp by the brain, but it is a heart grasp.
('15', 165, 1, 10, 307444) It is a thing which is not alien to us, but it is a thing which has to be evolved out of us.
('15', 165, 1, 11, 307537) It is always within us, with some consciously so; with others, quite unconsciously.
('15', 165, 1, 12, 307621) But it is there; and whether we wake up this religious instinct in us through outside assistance or by inward growth, no matter how it is done, it has got to be done if we want to do anything in the right manner and anything that is going to persist.
('15', 165, 2, 13, 307872) Our scriptures have laid down certain rules as maxims of life and as axioms which we have to take for granted as self demonstrated truths.
('15', 165, 2, 14, 308011) The shastras tell us that without living according to those maxims, we are incapable even of having a reasonable perception of religion.
('15', 165, 2, 15, 308148) Believing in these implicitly for all these long years and having actually endeavoured to reduce to practice these injunctions of the shastras, I have deemed it necessary to seek the association of those who think with me in founding this institution.
('15', 165, 2, 16, 308400) And I shall venture this morning to place before you the rules that have been drawn up and that have to be observed by everyone who seeks to be a member of that Ashram.
('15', 165, 3, 17, 308569) Five of these are known as Yamas, and the first and the foremost is, the
('15', 165, 4, 18, 308642) 1 it in New India
('15', 166, 0, 1, 308660) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 167
('15', 166, 1, 2, 308702) VOW OF TRUTH
('15', 166, 2, 3, 308715) Not truth simply as we ordinarily understand it, that as far as possible we ought not to resort to a lie, that is to say, not truth which merely answers the saying, Honesty is the best policy implying that if it is not the best policy, we may depart from it.
('15', 166, 2, 4, 308974) But here Truth, as it is conceived, means that we have to rule our life by this law of Truth at any cost.
('15', 166, 2, 5, 309080) And in order to satisfy the definition, I have drawn upon the celebrated illustration of the life of Prahlad 1. For the sake of Truth, he dared to oppose his own father, and he defended himself, not by retaliation by paying his father back in his own coin, but in defence of Truth, as he knew it, he was prepared to die without caring to return the blows that he had received from his father or from those who were charged with his fathers instructions.
('15', 166, 2, 6, 309534) Not only that: he would not in any way even parry the blows.
('15', 166, 2, 7, 309595) On the contrary, with a smile on his lips, he underwent the innumerable tortures to which he was subjected, with the result that at last, Truth rose triumphant, not that Prahlad suffered the tortures because he knew that some day or other in his very life time he would be able to demonstrate the infallibility of the law of Truth.
('15', 166, 2, 8, 309927) That fact was there; but if he had died in the midst of torture, he would still have adhered to Truth.
('15', 166, 2, 9, 310030) That is the Truth that I would like us to follow.
('15', 166, 2, 10, 310080) There was an incident I noticed yesterday.
('15', 166, 2, 11, 310123) It was a trifling incident, but I think these trifling incidents are like straws which show which way the wind is blowing.
('15', 166, 2, 12, 310246) The incident was this: I was talking to a friend who wanted to talk to me aside, and we were engaged in a private conversation.
('15', 166, 2, 13, 310374) A third friend dropped in and he politely asked whether he was intruding.
('15', 166, 2, 14, 310448) The friend to whom I was talking said: Oh, no, there is nothing private here. I felt taken aback a little, because, as I was taken aside, I knew that so far as this friend was concerned, the conversation was private.
('15', 166, 2, 15, 310665) But he immediately, out of politeness, I would call it over politeness, said there was no private conversation and that he (the third friend) could join.
('15', 166, 2, 16, 310819) I suggest to you that this is a departure from my definition of Truth.
('15', 166, 2, 17, 310890) I think that the friend should have, in the gentlest manner possible, but still openly and frankly, said: Yes, just now, as you properly say, you would be intruding without giving the slightest offence to the person if he was himself a gentlemanand we are bound to consider everybody to be a gentleman unless he
('15', 166, 3, 18, 311202) 1 Prahlad was a devotee of God persecuted by his unbelieving father, the demon king, Hiranyakashipu.
('15', 166, 3, 19, 311303) Gandhiji often spoke of him as an ideal satyagrahi.
('15', 167, 0, 1, 311355) 168 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 167, 1, 2, 311397) proves to be otherwise.
('15', 167, 1, 3, 311421) But I may be told that the incident, after all, proves the gentility of the nation.
('15', 167, 1, 4, 311505) I think that it is over proving the case.
('15', 167, 1, 5, 311547) If we continue to say these things out of politeness, we really become a nation of hypocrites.
('15', 167, 1, 6, 311642) I recall a conversation I had with an English friend.
('15', 167, 1, 7, 311696) He was comparatively a stranger.
('15', 167, 1, 8, 311729) He is a Principal of a College and has been in India for several years.
('15', 167, 1, 9, 311801) He was comparing notes with me, and he asked me whether I would admit that we, unlike most Englishmen, would not dare to say No when it was No that we meant.
('15', 167, 1, 10, 311959) And I must admit that I immediately said Yes.
('15', 167, 1, 11, 312005) I agree with that statement.
('15', 167, 1, 12, 312034) We do hesitate to say No, frankly and boldly, when we want to pay due regard to the sentiments of the person whom we are addressing.
('15', 167, 1, 13, 312167) In this Ashram, we make it a rule that we must say No when we mean No, regardless of consequences.
('15', 167, 1, 14, 312266) This, then, is the first rule.
('15', 167, 1, 15, 312297) Then we come to the
('15', 167, 2, 16, 312317) DOCTRINE OF AHIMSA
('15', 167, 3, 17, 312336) Literally speaking, ahimsa means non killing.
('15', 167, 3, 18, 312382) But to me it has a world of meaning and takes me into realms much higher, infinitely higher, than the realm to which I would go, if I merely understood by ahimsa non killing.
('15', 167, 3, 19, 312557) Ahimsa really means that you may not offend anybody, you may not harbour an uncharitable thought even in connection with one who may consider himself to be your enemy.
('15', 167, 3, 20, 312725) Pray notice the guarded nature of this thought; I do not say whom you consider to be your enemy, but who may consider himself to be your enemy.
('15', 167, 3, 21, 312869) For one who follows the doctrine of ahimsa, there is no room for an enemy; he denies the existence of an enemy.
('15', 167, 3, 22, 312981) But there are people who consider themselves to be his enemies, and he cannot help that circumstance.
('15', 167, 3, 23, 313083) So, it is held that we may not harbour an evil thought even in connection with such persons.
('15', 167, 3, 24, 313176) If we return blow for blow, we depart from the doctrine of ahimsa.
('15', 167, 3, 25, 313243) But I go further.
('15', 167, 3, 26, 313261) If we resent a friends action or the so called enemys action, we still fall short of this doctrine.
('15', 167, 3, 27, 313361) But when I say we should not resent, I do not say that we should acquiesce; but by resenting I mean wishing that some harm should be done to the enemy, or that he should be put out of the way, not even by any action of ours, but by the action of somebody else, or, say, by Divine agency.
('15', 167, 3, 28, 313649) If we harbour even this thought, we depart from this doctrine of ahimsa.
('15', 167, 3, 29, 313722) Those who join the Ashram have to literally accept that meaning.
('15', 167, 3, 30, 313787) That does not mean that we practise that doctrine in its entirety.
('15', 167, 3, 31, 313854) Far from it.
('15', 167, 3, 32, 313867) It is an ideal which we have to reach, and it is an ideal to be reached even at
('15', 168, 0, 1, 313947) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 169
('15', 168, 1, 2, 313989) this very moment, if we are capable of doing so.
('15', 168, 1, 3, 314038) But it is not a proposition in geometry to be learnt by heart: it is not even like solving difficult problems in higher mathematics; it is infinitely more difficult than solving those problems.
('15', 168, 1, 4, 314232) Many of you have burnt the midnight oil in solving those problems.
('15', 168, 1, 5, 314299) If you want to follow out this doctrine, you will have to do much more than burn the midnight oil.
('15', 168, 1, 6, 314398) You will have to pass many a sleepless night, and go through many a mental torture and agony before you can reach, before you can even be within measurable distance of this goal.
('15', 168, 1, 7, 314577) It is the goal, and nothing less than that, you and I have to reach if we want to understand what a religious life means.
('15', 168, 1, 8, 314699) I will not say much more on this doctrine than this: that a man who believes in the efficacy of this doctrine finds in the ultimate stage, when he is about to reach the goal, the whole world at his feet, not that he wants the whole world at his feet, but it must be so.
('15', 168, 1, 9, 314969) If you express your loveahimsain such a manner that it impresses itself indelibly upon your so called enemy, he must return that love.
('15', 168, 1, 10, 315104) Another thought which comes out of this is that, under this rule, there is no room for organised assassinations, and there is no room for murders even openly committed, and there is no room for any violence even for the sake of your country, and even for guarding the honour of precious ones that may be under your charge.
('15', 168, 1, 11, 315427) After all, that would be a poor defence of honour.
('15', 168, 1, 12, 315478) This doctrine of ahimsa tells us that we may guard the honour of those who are under our charge by delivering ourselves into the hands of the man who would commit the sacrilege.
('15', 168, 1, 13, 315656) And that requires far greater physical and mental courage than the delivering of blows.
('15', 168, 1, 14, 315744) You may have some degree of physical powerI do not say courageand you may use that power.
('15', 168, 1, 15, 315834) But after that is expended, what happens?
('15', 168, 1, 16, 315876) The other man is filled with wrath and indignation, and you have made him more angry by matching your violence against his; and when he has done you to death, the rest of his violence is delivered against your charge.
('15', 168, 1, 17, 316094) But if you do not retaliate, but stand your ground, between your charge and the opponent, simply receiving the blows without retaliating, what happens?
('15', 168, 1, 18, 316246) I give you my promise that the whole of the violence will be expended on you, and your charge will be left unscathed.
('15', 168, 1, 19, 316364) Under this plan of life, there is no conception of patriotism which justifies such wars as you witness today in Europe.
('15', 168, 1, 20, 316484) Then there is the
('15', 168, 2, 21, 316502) VOW OF CELIBACY
('15', 168, 3, 22, 316518) Those who want to perform national service, or those who want
('15', 169, 0, 1, 316580) 170 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 169, 1, 2, 316622) to have a glimpse of the real religious life, must lead a celibate life, no matter if married or unmarried.
('15', 169, 1, 3, 316730) Marriage but brings a woman closer together [sic] with the man, and they become friends in a special sense, never to be parted either in this life or in the lives that are to come.
('15', 169, 1, 4, 316911) But I do not think that, in our conception of marriage, our lusts should necessarily enter.
('15', 169, 1, 5, 317003) Be that as it may, this is what is placed before those who come to the Ashram.
('15', 169, 1, 6, 317082) I do not deal with that at any length.
('15', 169, 1, 7, 317121) Then we have the
('15', 169, 2, 8, 317138) VOW OF CONTROL OF THE PALATE
('15', 169, 3, 9, 317167) A man who wants to control his animal passions easily does so if he control his palate.
('15', 169, 3, 10, 317255) I fear this is one of the most difficult vows to follow.
('15', 169, 3, 11, 317312) I am just now coming after having inspected the Victoria Hostel.
('15', 169, 3, 12, 317377) I saw there, not to my dismay, though it should be to my dismay, but I am used to it now, that there are so many kitchens, not kitchens that are established in order to serve caste restrictions, but kitchens that have become necessary in order that people can have the condiments, and the exact weight of the condiments, to which they are used in the respective places from which they come.
('15', 169, 3, 13, 317768) And therefore we find that for the Brahmins themselves there are different compart ments and different kitchens catering for the delicate tastes of all these different groups, I suggest to you that this is simply slavery to the palate, rather than mastery over it.
('15', 169, 3, 14, 318033) I may say this: Unless we take our minds off from this habit, and unless we shut our eyes to the tea shops and coffee shops and all these kitchens, and unless we are satisfied with foods that are necessary for the proper maintenance of our physical health, and unless we are prepared to rid ourselves of stimulating, heating and exciting condiments that we mix with our food, we will certainly not be able to control the overabundant, unnecessary, exciting stimulation that we may have.
('15', 169, 3, 15, 318520) If we do not do that, the result naturally is, that we abuse ourselves and we abuse even the sacred trust given to us, and we become less than animals and brutes.
('15', 169, 3, 16, 318683) Eating, drinking and indulging passions we share in common with the animals, but have you ever seen a horse or a cow indulging in the abuse of the palate as we do?
('15', 169, 3, 17, 318847) Do you suppose that it is a sign of civilization, a sign of real life that we should multiply our eatables so far that we do not even know where we are; and seek; dish after dish until at last we have become absolutely mad and run after the newspaper sheets which give us advertisements about these dishes?
('15', 169, 3, 18, 319154) Then we have the
('15', 170, 0, 1, 319171) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 171
('15', 170, 1, 2, 319213) VOW OF NON THIEVING I suggest that we are thieves in a way.
('15', 170, 1, 3, 319273) If I take anything that I do not need for my own immediate use, and keep it, I thieve it from somebody else.
('15', 170, 1, 4, 319382) I venture to suggest that it is the fundamental law of Nature, without exception, that Nature produces enough for our wants from day to day, and if only everybody took enough for himself and nothing more, there would be no pauperism in this world, there would be no man dying of starvation in this world.
('15', 170, 1, 5, 319687) But so long as we have got this inequality, so long we are thieving.
('15', 170, 1, 6, 319756) I am no socialist and I do not want to dispossess those who have got possessions; but I do say that, personally, those of us who want to see light out of darkness have to follow the rule.
('15', 170, 1, 7, 319944) I do not want to dispossess anybody.
('15', 170, 1, 8, 319981) I should then be departing from the rule of ahimsa.
('15', 170, 1, 9, 320033) If somebody else possesses more than I do, let him.
('15', 170, 1, 10, 320085) But so far as my own life has to be regulated, I do say that I dare not possess anything which I do not want.
('15', 170, 1, 11, 320195) In India we have got three millions of people having to be satisfied with one meal a day, and that meal consisting of a chapati containing no fat in it, and a pinch of salt.
('15', 170, 1, 12, 320369) You and I have no right to anything that we really have until these three million are clothed and fed better.
('15', 170, 1, 13, 320479) You and I, who ought to know better, must adjust our wants, and even undergo voluntary starvation in order that they may be nursed, fed and clothed.
('15', 170, 1, 14, 320628) Then there is the vow of non possession which follows as a matter of course.
('15', 170, 1, 15, 320705) Then I go to the
('15', 170, 2, 16, 320722) VOW OF SWADESHI The vow of swadeshi is a necessary vow.
('15', 170, 2, 17, 320778) But you are conversant with the swadeshi life and the swadeshi spirit.
('15', 170, 2, 18, 320849) I suggest to you we are departing from one of the sacred laws of our being when we leave our neighbour and go out somewhere else in order to satisfy our wants.
('15', 170, 2, 19, 321009) If a man comes from Bombay here and offers you wares, you are not justified in supporting the Bombay merchant or trader so long as you have got a merchant at your very door, born and bred in Madras.
('15', 170, 2, 20, 321208) That is my view of swadeshi.
('15', 170, 2, 21, 321237) In your village, so long as you have got your village barber, you are bound to support him to the exclusion of the finished barber who may come to you from Madras.
('15', 170, 2, 22, 321401) If you find it necessary that your village barber should reach the attainment of the barber from Madras, you may train him to that.
('15', 170, 2, 23, 321533) Send him to Madras by all means, if you wish, in order that he may learn his calling.
('15', 170, 2, 24, 321619) Until you do that, you are not justified in going to another barber.
('15', 170, 2, 25, 321688) That is swadeshi.
('15', 170, 2, 26, 321706) So, when we find that there are many things that we cannot
('15', 171, 0, 1, 321765) 172 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 171, 1, 2, 321807) get in India, we must try to do without them.
('15', 171, 1, 3, 321853) We may have to do without many things which we may consider necessary, but believe me, when you have that frame of mind, you will find a great burden taken off your shoulders, even as the Pilgrim did in that inimitable book, Pilgrims Progress: There came a time when the mighty burden that the Pilgrim was carrying on his shoulders unconsciously dropped from him, and he felt a freer man than he was when he started on the journey.
('15', 171, 1, 4, 322285) So will you feel freer men than you are now, immediately you adopt this swadeshi life.
('15', 171, 1, 5, 322372) We have also the
('15', 171, 2, 6, 322389) VOW OF FEARLESSNESS
('15', 171, 3, 7, 322409) I found, throughout my wanderings in India, that India, educated India, is seized with a paralysing fear.
('15', 171, 3, 8, 322515) We may not open our lips in public; we may not declare our confirmed opinion in public; we may hold those opinions; we may talk about them secretly; and we may do anything we like within the four walls of our house,but those are not for public consumption.
('15', 171, 3, 9, 322772) If we had taken a vow of silence, I would have nothing to say.
('15', 171, 3, 10, 322835) When we open our lips in public, we say things which we do not really believe in.
('15', 171, 3, 11, 322917) I do not know whether this is not the experience of almost every public man who speaks in India.
('15', 171, 3, 12, 323014) I then suggest to you that there is only one Being, if Being is the proper term to be used, Whom we have to fear, and that is God.
('15', 171, 3, 13, 323145) When we fear God, we shall fear no man, no matter how high placed he may be.
('15', 171, 3, 14, 323222) And if you want to follow the vow of truth in any shape or form, fearlessness is the necessary consequence.
('15', 171, 3, 15, 323330) And so you find, in the Bhagavad Gita, fearlessness is declared as the first essential quality of a Brahmin.
('15', 171, 3, 16, 323439) We fear consequences, and therefore we are afraid to tell the truth.
('15', 171, 3, 17, 323508) A man who fears God will certainly not fear any earthly consequence.
('15', 171, 3, 18, 323577) Before we can aspire to the position of understanding what religion is, and before we can aspire to the position of guiding the destinies of India, do you not see that we should adopt this habit of fearlessness?
('15', 171, 3, 19, 323789) Or shall we over awe our countrymen even as we are over awed?
('15', 171, 3, 20, 323851) We thus see how important this fearlessness vow is.
('15', 171, 3, 21, 323903) And we have also the
('15', 171, 4, 22, 323924) VOW REGARDING THE UNTOUCHABLES
('15', 171, 5, 23, 323955) There is an ineffaceable blot that Hinduism today carries with it.
('15', 171, 5, 24, 324022) I have declined to believe that it has been handed to us from immemorial times.
('15', 171, 5, 25, 324102) I think that this miserable, wretched, enslaving spirit of untouchableness must have come to us when we were in
('15', 172, 0, 1, 324214) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 173
('15', 172, 1, 2, 324256) the cycle of our lives, at our lowest ebb, and that evil has still stuck to us and it still remains with us.
('15', 172, 1, 3, 324365) It is, to my mind, a curse that has come to us, and as long as that curse remains with us, so long I think we are bound to consider that every affliction that we labour under in this sacred land is a fit and proper punishment for this great and indelible crime that we are committing.
('15', 172, 1, 4, 324650) That any person should be considered untouchable because of his calling passes ones comprehension; and you, the student world, who receive all this modern education, if you become a party to this crime, it were better that you received no education whatsoever.
('15', 172, 1, 5, 324911) Of course, we are labouring under a very heavy handicap.
('15', 172, 1, 6, 324968) Although you may realise that there cannot be a single human being on this earth who should be considered to be untouchable, you cannot react upon your families, you cannot react upon your surroundings, because all your thought is conceived in a foreign tongue, and all your energy is devoted to that.
('15', 172, 1, 7, 325270) And so we have also introduced a rule in this Ashram that we shall receive our
('15', 172, 2, 8, 325349) EDUCATION THROUGH THE VERNACULARS
('15', 172, 3, 9, 325383) In Europe, every cultured man learns, not only his language, but also other languages, certainly three or four.
('15', 172, 3, 10, 325495) And even as they do in Europe, in order to solve the problem of language in India, we, in this Ashram, make it a point to learn as many Indian vernaculars as we possibly can.
('15', 172, 3, 11, 325670) And I assure you that the trouble of learning these languages is nothing compared to the trouble that we have to take in mastering the English language.
('15', 172, 3, 12, 325823) We never master the English language; with some exceptions, it has not been possible for us to do so; we can never express ourselves as clearly as we can in our own mother tongue.
('15', 172, 3, 13, 326003) How dare we rub out of our memory all the years of our infancy?
('15', 172, 3, 14, 326067) But that is precisely what we do when we commence our higher life, as we call it, through the medium of a foreign tongue.
('15', 172, 3, 15, 326189) This creates a breach in our life for bridging which we shall have to pay dearly and heavily.
('15', 172, 3, 16, 326283) And you will see now the connection between these two thingseducation and untouchablenessthis persistence of the spirit of untouchableness even at this time of the day in spite of the spread of knowledge and education.
('15', 172, 3, 17, 326502) Education has enabled us to see the horrible crime.
('15', 172, 3, 18, 326554) But we are seized with fear also and, therefore, we cannot take this doctrine to our homes.
('15', 172, 3, 19, 326646) And we have got a superstitious veneration for our family traditions and for the members of our family.
('15', 172, 3, 20, 326750) You say, My parents will die if I tell them that I, at
('15', 173, 0, 1, 326805) 174 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 173, 1, 2, 326847) least, can no longer partake of this crime. I say that Prahlad never considered that his father would die if he pronounced the sacred syllables of the name of Vishnu 1. On the contrary, he made the whole of that household ring, from one corner to another, by repeating that name even in the sacred presence of his father.
('15', 173, 1, 3, 327169) And so you and I may do this thing in the sacred presence of our parents.
('15', 173, 1, 4, 327243) If, after receiving this rude shock, some of them expire, I think that would be no calamity.
('15', 173, 1, 5, 327336) It may be that some rude shocks of the kind might have to be delivered.
('15', 173, 1, 6, 327408) So long as we persist in these things which have been handed down to us for generations, these incidents may happen.
('15', 173, 1, 7, 327525) But there is a higher law of Nature, and in due obedience to that higher law, my parents and myself should make that sacrifice, and then we follow
('15', 173, 2, 8, 327672) HAND WEAVING
('15', 173, 3, 9, 327685) You may ask: Why should we use our hands? and say the manual work has got to be done by those who are illiterate.
('15', 173, 3, 10, 327799) I can only occupy myself with reading literature and political essays. I think that we have to realise the dignity of labour.
('15', 173, 3, 11, 327925) If a barber or shoe maker attends a college, he ought not to abandon the profession of barber or shoe maker.
('15', 173, 3, 12, 328034) I consider that a barbers profession is just as good as the profession of medicine.
('15', 173, 4, 13, 328118) Last of all, when you have conformed to these rules, I think then, and not till then, you may come to
('15', 173, 5, 14, 328220) POLITICS
('15', 173, 6, 15, 328229) and dabble in them to your hearts content, and certainly you will then never go wrong.
('15', 173, 6, 16, 328316) Politics, divorced of religion, have absolutely no meaning.
('15', 173, 6, 17, 328376) If the student world crowd the political platforms of this country, to my mind it is not necessarily a healthy sign of national growth; but that does not mean that you, in your student life, ought not to study politics.
('15', 173, 6, 18, 328596) Politics are a part of our being; we ought to understand our national institutions, and we ought to understand our national growth and all those things.
('15', 173, 6, 19, 328749) We may do it from our infancy.
('15', 173, 6, 20, 328780) So, in our Ashram, every child is taught to understand the political institutions of our country, and to know how the country is vibrating with new emotions, with new aspirations, with a new life.
('15', 173, 6, 21, 328977) But we want also the steady light, the infallible light, of religious faith, not a faith
('15', 173, 7, 22, 329066) 1 One of the Hindu trinity, regarded as Preserver of the Universe
('15', 174, 0, 1, 329132) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 175
('15', 174, 1, 2, 329174) which merely appeals to the intelligence, but a faith which is indelibly inscribed on the heart.
('15', 174, 1, 3, 329271) First, we want to realise that religious consciousness, and immediately we have done that, I think the whole department of life is open to us,andit should then be a sacred privilege of students and everybody to partake of that whole life, so that, when they grow to manhood, and when they leave their colleges, they may do so as men properly quipped to battle with life.
('15', 174, 1, 4, 329642) Today what happens is this: much of the political life is confined to student life; immediately the students leave their colleges and cease to be students, they sink into oblivion, they seek miserable employments, carrying miserable emoluments, rising no higher in their aspirations, knowing nothing of God, knowing nothing of fresh air or bright light, and nothing of that real vigorous independence that comes out of obedience to these laws that I have ventured to place before you.
('15', 174, 2, 5, 330127) CONCLUSION I am not here asking you to crowd into the Ashram, there is no room there.
('15', 174, 2, 6, 330213) But I say that every one of you may enact that Ashram life individually and collectively.
('15', 174, 2, 7, 330303) I shall be satisfied with anything that you may choose from the rules I have ventured to place before you and act up to it.
('15', 174, 2, 8, 330427) But if you think that these are the outpourings of a mad man, you will not hesitate to tell me that it is so, and I shall take that judgment from you undismayed.

('15', 174, 3, 10, 330606) The Indian Review, February, 1916
('15', 174, 4, 11, 330640) 129. SPEECH AT MADRAS SOCIAL SERVICE LEAGUE 2
('15', 174, 5, 12, 330686) February 16, 1916
('15', 174, 6, 13, 330704) I have been asked to speak to you this evening about social service.
('15', 174, 6, 14, 330773) If this evening you find that I am not able to do sufficient justice to this great audience, you will ascribe it to so many engagements that I hastily and unthinkingly accepted.
('15', 174, 6, 15, 330951) It was my desire that I should have at least a few moments to think out what I shall have to say to you but it was not to be.
('15', 174, 6, 16, 331077) However, as our Chair Lady 3 has said, it is work we want and not speeches.
('15', 174, 6, 17, 331153) I am aware that you will have lost very little, if anything at all, if you find at the end of
('15', 174, 7, 18, 331247) 1 This paragraph is from New India, 16 2 1916.
('15', 174, 8, 19, 331294) 2 At its annual meeting held in the Madras Christian College 3 Mrs. Whitehead, who presided
('15', 175, 0, 1, 331386) 176 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 175, 1, 2, 331428) this evenings talk that you have listened to very little.
('15', 175, 2, 3, 331486) For social service, as for any other service on the face of the earth, there is one condition indispensable, viz., proper qualifications on the part of those who want to render that service.The question to be asked is whether those of us who are already engaged in this kind of service and those who aspire to render that service, possess the necessary qualifications; because you will agree with me that servants, if they can mend matters, can also spoil matters, and in trying to do service, however well intentioned that service might be, if they are not qualified for that service, they will be rendering not service but disservice.
('15', 175, 2, 4, 332123) What are those qualifications?
('15', 175, 2, 5, 332154) I imagine I should almost repeat to you the qualifications that I described this morning to the students in the Y.M.C.A. Hall, 2 because they are of universal application and are necessary for any class of work, much more in social service at this time of the day in our national life in our dear country.
('15', 175, 2, 6, 332460) It seems to me that we do require truth in one hand and fearlessness in the other hand.
('15', 175, 2, 7, 332548) Unless we carry the torch light of truth, we shall not see the stall 3 in front of us and unless we carry the quality of fearlessness we shall not be able to give the message that we might want to give and on proper occasion.
('15', 175, 2, 8, 332774) When the occasion for testing us comesand such occasions do not occur to men so often as they might imagine, they come but rarely, they are special privileges when that supreme final test comes, unless we have this fearlessness in the other hand, I feel sure we shall be found wanting.
('15', 175, 2, 9, 333060) But let me remind you also that these two qualities may be trained in us 4 in a manner detrimental to ourselves and to those with whom we may come in contact.
('15', 175, 2, 10, 333219) This is a dangerous statement almost to make, as if truth could be ever so handled, and in making that statement I would like you also to consider that truth comes not as truth but only as truth so called.
('15', 175, 2, 11, 333425) 5 You will recall the instance of Ravana and Rama and that of Lakshman and Indrajit in that inimitable book the Ramayana.
('15', 175, 2, 12, 333547) Lakshman and Indrajit both possessed the same qualities.
('15', 175, 2, 13, 333604) Both had performed austerities, both had attained a certain amount of self control.
('15', 175, 2, 14, 333688) It was therefore most difficult to conquer Indrajit.
('15', 175, 2, 15, 333741) We find

('15', 176, 1, 2, 333982) what Indrajit possessed was mere dross and what Lakshman possessed was of great assistance not only to him, not only to the side on whose behalf he was fighting, but to us, to whom he has left a treasure to cherish and to value.
('15', 176, 1, 3, 334211) What was that additional quality that Lakshman possessed?
('15', 176, 1, 4, 334269) Lakshman was divinely guided.
('15', 176, 1, 5, 334299) He had religious perception.
('15', 176, 1, 6, 334328) His life was guided upon 1 principle and based upon religion, and the life of Indrajit upon irreligion.
('15', 176, 1, 7, 334432) Indrajit knew not where he was going.
('15', 176, 1, 8, 334470) Life without religion is life without principle and life without principle is like a ship without a rudder.
('15', 176, 1, 9, 334578) Just as a ship without a rudder and the helmsman will be tossed about from place to place and will never reach its destination, so will a man without religious backing, without the hard 2 grasp of religion, be tossed about on this stormy ocean of the world without ever reaching its destined goal.
('15', 176, 1, 10, 334876) So I suggest to every social servant not to run away with the idea that he will be able to serve his fellow countrymen without these two qualities duly sanctified by religious perception and divine guidance.
('15', 176, 1, 11, 335084) Immediately we have these two qualities, even our mistakes which we would still commit will not be mistakes that would redound to our discredit or injure the cause that we may handle or the persons of the communities we may want to serve.
('15', 176, 1, 12, 335323) Our Chair Lady was good enough to take me to the Pariah Village just behind the compound of the Bishops house and described to me the condition that little village was in before this League commenced its operations there.
('15', 176, 1, 13, 335545) After seeing the village, I make bold to state that it is a model of cleanliness and order and it is much cleaner than some of the busiest and the most central parts of Madras.
('15', 176, 1, 14, 335722) That is undoubtedly a creditable piece of work on the part of the Social Service League; and if the League can penetrate into the recesses of Madras and do the same kind of work, certain things which I have noticed in Madras will be conspicuous by their absence when I next pay my visit to this great city.
('15', 176, 1, 15, 336029) (Cheers.) These things stare us in the face and have got to be remedied.
('15', 176, 1, 16, 336102) When our Pariah brethren are amenable to reason and persuasion, shall we say that the so called higher classes are not equally amenable to reason and persuasion and are not amenable to hygienic laws which are indispensable in order to live the city life?
('15', 176, 1, 17, 336357) We may do many things with immunity but when we immediately transfer ourselves to crowded streets where we have

('15', 177, 1, 3, 336674) Do we do that?
('15', 177, 1, 4, 336689) 1 It is no use saddling the Municipality with responsibilities for the condition in which we find not only the central parts of Madras, but of every city in India without exception.
('15', 177, 1, 5, 336871) No municipality in the world will be able to override the habits of a class of people which have been handed to them from generation to generation.
('15', 177, 1, 6, 337019) It is a work that can be done only by patient toil and divine guidance.
('15', 177, 1, 7, 337091) With these two immutable weapons in our hands, it can be done only by such bodies as Social Service Leagues.
('15', 177, 1, 8, 337200) We are pulsating with a new life and a new vision which will add dignity to our nationality and will carry the banner of progress forward.
('15', 177, 1, 9, 337339) The question of sanitary reform in big cities is practically a hopeless task if we expect our municipalities to do this unaided by this voluntary work.
('15', 177, 1, 10, 337491) Far be it from me to absolve the municipalities from their own responsibilities.
('15', 177, 1, 11, 337572) There is a great deal still left to be done by them.
('15', 177, 1, 12, 337625) Only the other day I read with a great degree of pain a report about the proceedings of the Bombay Municipality, and the deplorable fact in it is that a large part of the time of the Municipality was devoted to talking over trifles while they neglected matters of great moment.
('15', 177, 1, 13, 337903) 2 Municipalities will be able to do very little unless there is a demand for further improvement from the people themselves.
('15', 177, 1, 14, 338028) In one of the model principalities in India, officials and others complained that in spite of their ceaseless vigilance and efforts, it was not possible for them to turn the people away from the ways they had adopted and which had become part of their being.
('15', 177, 1, 15, 338287) Still the principality showed signs of visible progress.
('15', 177, 1, 16, 338344) The Dewan of the place assured him that had it not been for the valuable assistance rendered by the Social Service League, people would not have done half of what they had done.
('15', 177, 1, 17, 338522) Terrorism of officials is of no avail.
('15', 177, 1, 18, 338561) I agree with that celebrated saint who said: It is far better that people should even remain drunkards rather than that they should become sober at the point of the sword. If a man, after an appeal is made to his heart and after due effort is made to redeem him from bad ways, continues to believe he must drink himself to death, I am afraid we must allow him to do so; we cannot help it; we are not going to heap evil upon evil.
('15', 177, 1, 19, 338991) It is no use doing physical harm to the man.
('15', 177, 1, 20, 339036) He may cease to drink for the time being, but he will return to it again and

('15', 178, 1, 2, 339228) There is little merit in the physical denial when there is no mental co operation.
('15', 178, 1, 3, 339311) The streets of Kashi, the most sacred place for the Hindus, are dirty.
('15', 178, 1, 4, 339382) The same dirt was to be seen even in the sanctuary where the din and noise was very great.
('15', 178, 1, 5, 339473) In such a place there should be perfect orderliness, peace, silence, gentleness and humility.
('15', 178, 1, 6, 339567) All these things, I regret to say, were conspicuous by their absence.
('15', 178, 1, 7, 339637) The priests do not accept anything less than a rupee from the devotees.
('15', 178, 1, 8, 339709) That could not have been the position of Kashi Viswanath in ages gone by.
('15', 178, 1, 9, 339783) When people are transported to Kashi in a railway Express by millions and when the surroundings are altered, one condition of orderly progress is that people should respond to the new conditions.
('15', 178, 1, 10, 339979) What is true of Kashi Viswanath is true in the majority of cases in our holy temples.
('15', 178, 1, 11, 340065) Here is a problem for the Social Service League.
('15', 178, 1, 12, 340114) It must not be a problem for Government or municipality.
('15', 178, 1, 13, 340171) Immediately you begin going to schools, you leave temples alone.
('15', 178, 1, 14, 340236) Before we fit ourselves for this work, we should revolutionise the educational system.
('15', 178, 1, 15, 340323) We are today in a false position and I promise that we shall incur the curse of the next generation for this great tragedy enacted before us.
('15', 178, 1, 16, 340465) It is a matter for thinking and redressing.
('15', 178, 1, 17, 340509) The task may be Herculean, but this reward will be adequate.
('15', 178, 1, 18, 340570) I have placed a few thoughts before you at random and I hope that they will sink deep into you and exercise your hearts.
('15', 178, 1, 19, 340691) You should never rest satisfied until you have put your shoulder to the wheel and assisted to the best of your ability to bring about the necessary reform.

('15', 178, 1, 21, 340928) Do not dominate those who wrongly think they are your inferiors, seeing your costume.
('15', 178, 1, 22, 341014) If you do so, you will be dis qualified for rendering social service.

('15', 178, 4, 25, 341124) [Before February 17, 1916]
('15', 178, 5, 26, 341151) Mr. M. K. Gandhi writes to us: Mrs. Besants reference in New India and certain other references to the Benares Incident perhaps render it necessary for me to return to the subject, however disinclined I may be to do so.
('15', 178, 5, 27, 341371) Mrs. Besant denies my statement with reference to her whispering to the
('15', 179, 0, 1, 341443) 180 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 179, 1, 2, 341485) Princes.
('15', 179, 1, 3, 341494) 1 I can only say that if I can trust my eyes and my ears, I must adhere to the statement I have made.
('15', 179, 1, 4, 341596) She occupied a seat on the left of the semi circle on the other side of the Maharaja of Darbhanga, who occupied the chair, and there was at least one Prince, perhaps, there were two who were sitting on her side.
('15', 179, 1, 5, 341808) Whilst I was speaking, Mrs. Besant was almost behind me.
('15', 179, 1, 6, 341865) When the Maharaja rose, Mrs. Besant had also risen.
('15', 179, 1, 7, 341917) I had ceased speaking before the Rajahs actually left the platform.
('15', 179, 1, 8, 341985) She was discussing the incident with a group round her on the platform.
('15', 179, 1, 9, 342057) I gently suggested to her that she might have refrained from interrupting, but that if she disapproved of the speech after it was finished, she could have then dissociated herself from my sentiments.
('15', 179, 1, 10, 342257) But she, with some degree of warmth, said, How could we sit still when you were compromising everyone of us on the platform?
('15', 179, 1, 11, 342382) You ought not to have made the remarks you did. This answer of Mrs. Besants does not quite tally with her solicitude for me which alone, according to her version of the incident, prompted her to interrupt the speech.
('15', 179, 1, 12, 342599) I suggest that if she merely meant to protect me, she could have passed a note round or whispered into my ears her advice.
('15', 179, 1, 13, 342722) And, again, if it was for my protection, why was it necessary for her to rise with the Princes and to leave the hall as I hold she did along with them?
('15', 179, 1, 14, 342874) So far as my remarks are concerned, I am yet unable to know what it was in my speech that seems to her to be open to such exception as to warrant her interruption.
('15', 179, 1, 15, 343038) After referring to the Viceregal visit and the necessary precautions that were taken for the Viceroys safety, I showed that an assassins death was anything but an honourable death, and said that anarchism was opposed to our shastras and had no room in India.
('15', 179, 1, 16, 343297) I said then where there was honourable death, it would go down history as men who died for their conviction.
('15', 179, 1, 17, 343406) But when a bomb thrower died, secretly plotting all sorts of things, what could he gain?
('15', 179, 1, 18, 343495) I then went on to state and deal with the fallacy that had not bomb throwers thrown bombs, we should never have gained what we did with reference to the Partition Movement.
('15', 179, 1, 19, 343668) It was at about this stage that Mrs. Besant appealed to the chair to stop me.
('15', 179, 1, 20, 343746) Personally, I will desire a publication of the whole of my speech 2
('15', 179, 2, 21, 343814) whose trend was a sufficient warrant for showing that I could not possibly incite the students to deeds of violence.
('15', 179, 2, 22, 343931) Indeed it was

('15', 180, 1, 2, 344111) conceived in order to carry on a rigorous self examination.
('15', 180, 1, 3, 344171) I began by saying that it was a humiliation for the audience and myself that I should have to speak in English.
('15', 180, 1, 4, 344283) I said that English having been the medium of instruction, it had done a tremendous injury to the country, and as I conceive I showed successfully that had we received training during the past 50 years in higher thought in our own vernaculars, we would be today within reach of our goal.
('15', 180, 1, 5, 344571) I then referred to the self government Resolution passed at the Congress and showed that whilst the All India Congress Committee and theAll India Moslem League would be drawing up their paper about the future constitution, their duty was to fit themselves by their own action for self government.
('15', 180, 1, 6, 344868) And in order to show how short we fell of our duty, I drew attention to the dirty condition of the labyrinth of lanes surrounding the great temple of Kashi Viswanath and the recently erected palatial buildings without any conception as to the straightness or the width of the streets.
('15', 180, 1, 7, 345153) I then took the audience to the gorgeous scene that was enacted on the day of the foundation and suggested that if a stranger not knowing anything about Indian life had visited the scene, he would have gone away under the false impression that India was one of the richest countries in the world such was the display of jewellery worn by our noblemen.
('15', 180, 1, 8, 345505) And turning to the Maharajas and the Rajahs, I humorously suggested that it was necessary for them to hold those treasures in trust for the nation before we could realise our ideals, and I cited 1 the action of the Japanese noblemen who considered it a glorious privilege, even though there was no necessity for them, to dispossess themselves of treasures and lands which were handed to them from generation to generation.
('15', 180, 1, 9, 345928) I then asked the audience to consider the humiliating spectacle of he Viceroys person having to be protected from ourselves when he was our honoured guest.
('15', 180, 1, 10, 346084) And I was endeavouring to show that the blame for these precautions was also on ourselves, in that they were rendered necessary because of the introduction of organised assassination in India.
('15', 180, 1, 11, 346277) Thus I was endeavouring to show, on the one hand, how the students could usefully occupy themselves in assisting to rid the society of its proved defects and, on the other, wean themselves even in thought from methods of violence.
('15', 180, 1, 12, 346508) I claim that with twenty years experience of public life in the course of which I had to address on scores of occasions turbulant

('15', 181, 1, 2, 346731) audiences, I have some experience of feeling the pulse of my audience.
('15', 181, 1, 3, 346802) I was following closely how the speech was being taken and I certainly did not notice that the student world was being adversely affected.
('15', 181, 1, 4, 346941) Indeed some of them came to me the following morning and told me that they perfectly understood my remarks which had gone home.
('15', 181, 1, 5, 347069) One of them, a keen debater, even subjected me to cross examination and seemed to feel convinced by a further development of the argument such as I had advanced in the course of my speech.
('15', 181, 1, 6, 347258) Indeed I have spoken now to thousands of students and others of my countrymen throughout South Africa, England and India; and by precisely the arguments that I used that evening, I claim to have weaned many from their approval of anarchical methods.
('15', 181, 1, 7, 347508) Finally, I observe that Mr. S. S. Setlur, of Bombay, who has written on the incident to The Hindu in no friendly mood towards me, and who I think in some respects totally unfairly has endeavoured to tear me to pieces, and who was an eye witness to the proceedings, gives a version different from Mrs. Besants.
('15', 181, 1, 8, 347818) He thinks that the general impression was not that I was encouraging the anarchists but that I was playing the role of an apologist for the Civilian bureaucrat The whole of Mr. Setlurs attack upon me shows that if he is right I was certainly not guilty of any incitement to violence and that the offence consisted in my reference to jewellery, etc.
('15', 181, 1, 9, 348167) In order that the fullest justice might be done both to Mrs. Besant and myself, I would make the following suggestion.
('15', 181, 1, 10, 348286) She says that she does not propose to defend herself by quoting the sentence which drove the Princes away and that that would be playing into the enemies hands; according to her previous statement, my speech is already in the hands of detectives so that, so far as my safety is concerned, her forbearance is not going to be of the slightest use.
('15', 181, 1, 11, 348632) Would it not therefore be better that she should either publish a verbatim report if she has it or reproduce such sentiments in my speech as in her opinion necessitated her interruption and the Princes withdrawal?
('15', 181, 1, 12, 348846) I will, therefore, conclude this statement by repeating what I have said before; 1 that but for Mrs. Besants interruption, I would have concluded my speech within a few minutes and no possible misconception about my views on anarchism would have arisen.

('15', 182, 6, 8, 349659) [February 17, 1916]
('15', 182, 7, 9, 349679) Last evening at the Anderson Hall, Madras, under the auspices of the Christian College Associated Societies, a joint debate was held on the subject, Shall the Vernaculars be the Media of Instruction in our Schools and Colleges? with Mr. M. K. Gandhi in the chair.
('15', 182, 8, 10, 349943) Mr. A. S. Rajam opened the debate on the subject in a short speech.
('15', 182, 9, 11, 350011) The Chairman then wound up the debate and said that certainly the question of racial difference would not occur if vernaculars were to be made the media of instruction in schools and colleges.
('15', 182, 9, 12, 350204) In our country, they were one Nation, and even before the English advent, they did form one Nation and had one common religion.
('15', 182, 9, 13, 350332) There were histories to show that our sacred saga had travelled from one part of the country to another in those days for the purpose of religious gatherings, and thus brotherly feelings always existed among the people.
('15', 182, 9, 14, 350552) For the real progress of the country and for the welfare of the masses, this problem ought to be solved by the authorities concerned at an early date.
('15', 182, 9, 15, 350703) These objections against the introduction of vernaculars were all baseless and the best thing was for the people themselves to solve this question, and educate the masses of the country through the media of vernaculars.
('15', 182, 9, 16, 350923) The rulers themselves would then have to learn the vernaculars of the country in the interests of proper administration.
('15', 182, 10, 17, 351044) A hearty vote of thanks to the Chairman terminated the proceedings.

('15', 183, 2, 3, 351246) February 19, 1916
('15', 183, 3, 4, 351264) A meeting to celebrate the anniversary of the late Mr. Gokhales death was held in the Kirloskar Theatre, Poona City, on the 19th instant.
('15', 183, 4, 5, 351402) There were about 2,000 persons present.
('15', 183, 5, 6, 351442) Mr. H. W. Wadia, Bar at Law, presided.
('15', 183, 6, 7, 351481) Mr. Gandhi, who came down to Poona at the invitation of the Deccan Sabha, hoped that the anniversary would be celebrated with due regularity and it would take the form of stock taking on the part of those who revered the memory of the deceased and wanted to show their reverence by taking some part of the activity of the deceased.
('15', 183, 6, 8, 351813) 1 Mr. Gokhales work in the Imperial Council and on the Public Service Commission showed great ability and patriotism.
('15', 183, 6, 9, 351931) He worked on the South African question regardless of his health and it had, in Mr. Gandhis opinion, cost him ten years of his life.
('15', 183, 6, 10, 352064) The speaker suggested that behind all the work of Mr. Gokhale lay his great spirituality.
('15', 183, 6, 11, 352154) It was because Mr. Gokhale felt it necessary to spiritualise the political life of the country that he had brought the Servants of India Society into being.
('15', 183, 6, 12, 352311) Mr. Gokhale once said to the speaker that there were moments when he doubted the efficacy of much of the political work and was distressed by severe disappointments, but he was saved from such a situation by a consciousness of the faith that he had deep down in him in the existence of the permanent element and it was this faith, thought Mr. Gandhi, which made him triumph over all disappointments and persist in the work.
('15', 183, 7, 13, 352735) The speaker said that he had toured the country during the past year in accordance with the wishes of Mr. Gokhale, and now without his advice to guide him, he was at a loss to know whether he was drifting in the right or the wrong direction.
('15', 183, 7, 14, 352977) In the course of his travels, he found that the country was vibrating with a passionate spirit of patriotism, but the bugbear of fear loomed large on the horizon.
('15', 183, 7, 15, 353140) Social endeavour was impeded by the overawing power of spiritual authority, and in the path of political activity lay the barrier of political authority.
('15', 183, 7, 16, 353294) They were the slaves of circumstances, but they were themselves to blame.
('15', 183, 7, 17, 353368) It had become impossible for them to voice in public the opinions uttered in their homes.
('15', 183, 7, 18, 353458) The spiritual liberty of the people was usurped by the priests; in politics they were afraid to give expression to their views.
('15', 183, 7, 19, 353586) This was a regrettable state of affairs and showed that they were lacking

('15', 184, 1, 3, 353915) Until they had driven out this craven spirit fromtheir hearts, they were unworthy of undertaking the great charge bequeathed to them.
('15', 184, 1, 4, 354049) The heroes of the past were still with them in spirit.
('15', 184, 1, 5, 354104) Faith in the lives of the great departed, sincerity, humanity and patriotism would enable them to weather the storm and establish their country in its destined place among the nations of the world.
('15', 184, 2, 6, 354302) The president in thanking Mr. Gandhi for his address said that he was not prepared to say anything about the apprehensions and hopes which Mr. Gandhi had spoken of, but would merely mention that he did not agree with him.
('15', 184, 2, 7, 354524) He had considerable experience of politics and entertained the brightest hopes for India....
('15', 184, 3, 8, 354617) The Honble Mr. R. P. Paranjpe proposed a vote of thanks to Mr. Gandhi and the Chairman.

('15', 184, 7, 14, 354963) So now I shall only leave on Monday and reach there on Tuesday.
('15', 184, 7, 15, 355027) Most probably I shall leave by the Gujarat Mail.
('15', 184, 7, 16, 355076) If Santok accompanies me, I shall leave by the Kathiawar Express.
('15', 184, 7, 17, 355142) Most Probably she will come with me.

('15', 185, 2, 3, 355536) February 23, 1916
('15', 185, 3, 4, 355554) Everyone here knows the gentleman who will soon address us.
('15', 185, 3, 5, 355614) Hence I need not speak at length by way of introducing him.
('15', 185, 3, 6, 355674) He has taken up the mission of founding a university for Indian women.
('15', 185, 3, 7, 355745) The task will entail the revival of different regional languages.
('15', 185, 3, 8, 355811) He proposes to start in June an examining and teaching university.
('15', 185, 3, 9, 355878) It is said that in our society as it is today men suffer from ardhangavayu 2 and this charge is by and large well founded because we are not able to make our better halves keep pace with us.
('15', 185, 3, 10, 356069) Circumstances are chiefly responsible for this state of affairs.
('15', 185, 3, 11, 356134) Karve has undertaken this work in order to improve the condition of women and has set about it briskly.
('15', 185, 3, 12, 356238) I must indeed admit that his enthusiasm is matchless.
('15', 185, 3, 13, 356292) If I may introduce him in the words of Mr. Gokhale, he is truth incarnate.
('15', 185, 3, 14, 356367) We are therefore confident that, even if his work is not crowned with all the success one may hope for, no harm is likely to result from it any time.
('15', 185, 3, 15, 356517) He has devoted twenty years of service to the Fergusson College and has been managing a widows home for as many years.
('15', 185, 3, 16, 356636) Now, at the age of 59, he has started on a new venture, a mark of the highest self sacrifice and zeal.
('15', 185, 3, 17, 356739) In Gujarat, we do not have the spirit of self sacrifice that we find in Poona.
('15', 185, 3, 18, 356818) This should make us feel ashamed of ourselves; Gujarat has, therefore, much to learn from the life of Prof.
('15', 185, 4, 19, 356926) Concluding the proceedings, Gandhiji said: Mrs. Vidyagauri[s 3 speech] invites some comments.
('15', 185, 4, 20, 357020) We shall accept equality of rights for women, but I think their education should differ from mens, as their nature and functions do.
('15', 185, 4, 21, 357153) In progressive countries, women receive the very highest education but, after it is over, they do not have to perform the same duties as men and in our country women have never to compete with men for a livelihood.
('15', 185, 4, 22, 357368) The help this institution receives from us, whatever it be, will not gounavailing to us.

('15', 186, 6, 8, 358047) CHHAGANLAL, I have just returned, having been to Madras, where I saw Chi.
('15', 186, 6, 9, 358121) Maganlal and Jamnadas, and to Bombay, where I saw Shri Khushalbhai and others.
('15', 186, 6, 10, 358200) Santok and the two girls have come away with me, for their work there was over and Maganlal had to be all over Madras.
('15', 186, 6, 11, 358319) I have advised him to return, after completing his study of Tamil.
('15', 186, 6, 12, 358386) He tells me he has done a good job of learning weaving.
('15', 186, 6, 13, 358442) Jamnadas and his wife will stay on in Madras.
('15', 186, 6, 14, 358488) One cant say that Jamnadass health is normal again.
('15', 186, 6, 15, 358540) The rest are flourishing.
('15', 186, 6, 16, 358566) Khushalbhai and all of us wish that you should now come away 2. It seems improper for you to engage in business there.
('15', 186, 6, 17, 358685) Do what you think best about the house and the small farm.
('15', 186, 6, 18, 358744) I dont think anyone can be sent over from here just now, nor has there been any such demand.
('15', 186, 6, 19, 358837) Rather, Mr. Pragji writes to say that, if anyone were to be sent, Bhaga would have to be relieved.
('15', 186, 6, 20, 358936) You need not be much concerned about your coming over here.
('15', 186, 6, 21, 358996) It is but natural that I should want you to be with me.
('15', 186, 6, 22, 359052) If you wish, however, I shall make other arrangements.
('15', 186, 6, 23, 359107) Once you are here, everything will be managed.
('15', 186, 6, 24, 359154) I find that Khushalbhai and Devbhabhi 3 have taken very well to Bombay.
('15', 186, 6, 25, 359226) There is no limit to what I get from them, as though they owe a debt to me.
('15', 186, 6, 26, 359302) I am not even allowed to feel that we are only cousins.

('15', 187, 4, 7, 360065) 137. INDENTURED LABOUR
('15', 187, 5, 8, 360088) The question of indentured labour is a seasonable subject for more reasons than one.
('15', 187, 5, 9, 360173) Messrs Andrews and Pearson have just re turned from Fiji after finishing their self imposed labours for the sake of India which they have learnt to love as they love their mother land.
('15', 187, 5, 10, 360358) Their report is about to be issued.
('15', 187, 5, 11, 360394) There Mr. Malaviya has given notice for leave to move a resolution 2 in the Imperial Council which will, if adopted, commit the Government to a repeal of the system of indentured labour.
('15', 187, 5, 12, 360581) Mr. Malaviyas resolution will be, it may be re called, a continuation of the late Mr. Gokhales work in 1912, when in a speech full of fervour and weighted with facts and figures, he moved his resolution demanding repeal of this form of labour.
('15', 187, 5, 13, 360825) The deceased statesmans resolution was thrown out only by the force of official majority.
('15', 187, 5, 14, 360915) The moral victory lay with Mr. Gokhale.
('15', 187, 5, 15, 360955) The death knell of the system was rung when that resolution was moved.
('15', 187, 5, 16, 361026) The Govern ment, as it could not then abolish the system, outvoted Mr. Gokhale but did not fail to note that they must hurry forward to do so at an early date.
('15', 187, 5, 17, 361186) Mr. Malaviyas proposed resolution and the report of Messrs Andrews and Pearson, which latter, it is known, is to suggest total abolition of the system, will enable Lord Hardinge fittingly to close his most eventful viceroyalty removing this long standing and acknowledged grievance.
('15', 187, 5, 18, 361469) These lines will be merely an attempt to give personal observations and to indulge in a few reflections upon the question.
('15', 187, 5, 19, 361592) For facts and figures, the readers and the public workers must look up Mr. Gokhales speech referred to above and Messrs Andrews and
('15', 187, 6, 20, 361724) 1 Imam Abdul Kadir Bawazeer 2 In March, 1916, Madan Mohan Malaviya moved a resolution in the Imperial Legislative Council for the abolition of the indenture system.
('15', 188, 0, 1, 361889) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 189
('15', 188, 1, 2, 361931) Pearsons forthcoming report.
('15', 188, 2, 3, 361960) Indentured labour is admittedly a remnant of slavery.
('15', 188, 2, 4, 362014) The late Sir William Wilson Hunter, when his attention was drawn to it in 1895, was the first to call it a state perilously near to slavery.
('15', 188, 2, 5, 362155) Most legislation only partly reflects the public opinion of its time.
('15', 188, 2, 6, 362225) Legislation abolishing slavery was really a bit in advance of public opinion, and that was a big bit.
('15', 188, 2, 7, 362327) And its effect, like that of all such legislation, was largely neutralized by the dissatisfied slave owner resorting to the dodge of indentured labour.
('15', 188, 2, 8, 362479) The yoke, if it fell from the Negros black neck, was transferred to the brown neck of the Indian.
('15', 188, 2, 9, 362577) In the process of transfer, it had to be somewhat polished, it had to be lightened in weight and even disguised.
('15', 188, 2, 10, 362690) Nevertheless, in all its essentials, it retained its original quality.
('15', 188, 2, 11, 362761) The hideousness of the system was forcefully demonstrated when the curse descended upon South Africa in the shape of indentured labourers from China for working the gold mines.
('15', 188, 2, 12, 362938) It was no mere election cry that the l ate Sir Henry Campbell Bannerman 1 had taken up when he made the British Isles from end t o end ring with denunciation of t he system.
('15', 188, 2, 13, 363112) No cost was counted as too great for ridding South Africa of the evil.
('15', 188, 2, 14, 363183) The great multi millionaires of Johannesburg spared nothing to be enabled to hold on to the indentured Chinaman.
('15', 188, 2, 15, 363296) They asked for breathing time.
('15', 188, 2, 16, 363327) The House of Commons remained unmoved.
('15', 188, 2, 17, 363366) Mine owners had to shift for themselves.
('15', 188, 2, 18, 363407) The interests of humanity overrode all other considerations.
('15', 188, 2, 19, 363468) The mines were threatened to be closed.
('15', 188, 2, 20, 363508) The House did not care.
('15', 188, 2, 21, 363532) The millions promised to Mr. Chamberlain 2 would not be forthcoming.
('15', 188, 2, 22, 363601) The House laughed.
('15', 188, 2, 23, 363620) Within six months of the passage of the measure for the abolition of Chinese indentured labour, every Chinese labourer had been repatriated bag and baggage.
('15', 188, 2, 24, 363777) The mines survived the shock.
('15', 188, 2, 25, 363807) They discovered other methods of life.
('15', 188, 2, 26, 363846) And now be it said to the credit of the mine owners as well as of the Conservatives who opposed the measure, that both these classes recognize that the abolition was a great deliverance.
('15', 188, 3, 27, 364033) Indian indentured labour is not less demoralising.
('15', 188, 3, 28, 364084) It has persisted because its bitterness like that of a sugared pill has been cleverly though unconsciously concealed.
('15', 188, 3, 29, 364202) The one great distinction between the two classes was that the Chinese were brought in without a

('15', 189, 1, 3, 364572) Had the Chinese remained, they would have sapped the very foundations of society.
('15', 189, 1, 4, 364654) The Indian labourers confine the evil to themselves.
('15', 189, 1, 5, 364707) This may be unimportant to non Indians.
('15', 189, 1, 6, 364747) But for us, the wonder is that we have allowed the sin to continue so long.
('15', 189, 1, 7, 364823) This business about the women is the weakest and the irremediable part of the evil.
('15', 189, 1, 8, 364907) It therefore needs a somewhat closer inspection.
('15', 189, 1, 9, 364956) These women are not necessarily wives.
('15', 189, 1, 10, 364995) Men and women are huddled together during the voyage.
('15', 189, 1, 11, 365049) The marriage is a farce.
('15', 189, 1, 12, 365074) A mere declaration by man and woman made upon landing before the Protector of Immigrants that they are husband and wife constitutes a valid marriage.
('15', 189, 1, 13, 365224) Naturally enough, divorce is common.
('15', 189, 1, 14, 365261) The rest must be left to the imagination of the reader.
('15', 189, 1, 15, 365317) This is certainthat the system does not add to the moral well being of India.
('15', 189, 1, 16, 365395) And it is suggested that no amount of figures adduced to show that the labourer is far richer at the end of his contract of labour than when he entered upon it can be allowed to be any set off against the moral degradation it involves.
('15', 189, 2, 17, 365631) There is another most powerful consideration to be urged against the continuance of this system.
('15', 189, 2, 18, 365728) The relations between Englishmen and Indians in India are not of the happiest.
('15', 189, 2, 19, 365807) The average Englishman considers himself to be superior to the average Indian and the latter is generally content to be so considered.
('15', 189, 2, 20, 365942) Such a state of things is demoralizing to both and a menace to the stability of the British Empire.
('15', 189, 2, 21, 366042) There is no reason why every Englishman should not learn to consider every Indian as his brother, and why every Indian should not cease to think that he is born to fear every Englishman.
('15', 189, 2, 22, 366229) Be thatas it may, this unnatural relationship is reflected in an exaggerated form outside India when the artificial state of indentured service under the white employer is set up.
('15', 189, 2, 23, 366409) Unless, therefore, the relation between the English and ourselves is put on a correct footing in India, any transference of Indian labourers to far off lands, whether parts of the Empire or otherwise, even under a free contract must harm both employer and employed.
('15', 189, 2, 24, 366675) I happen to have the privilege of knowing most humane employers of Indian labourers in Natal.
('15', 189, 2, 25, 366769) They were their men.
('15', 189, 2, 26, 366790) But they do not, they cannot, give them more than the most favoured treatment that their cattle receive.
('15', 189, 2, 27, 366895) I use this language in no uncharitable spirit.
('15', 189, 2, 28, 366942) The humanest of employers cannot escape the limitations of his class.
('15', 189, 2, 29, 367012) He instinctively feels that the Indian labourer is inferior to him and can never be equal to him.
('15', 189, 2, 30, 367110) Surely no indentured Indian, no matter how clever and faithful he may be, has ever
('15', 190, 0, 1, 367193) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 191
('15', 190, 1, 2, 367235) inherited his masters state.
('15', 190, 1, 3, 367264) But I know English servants who have risen to their masters state even as Indian servants have risen to their Indian masters state.
('15', 190, 1, 4, 367396) It is not the Englishmans fault that the relationship with his Indian employees has not been progressive.
('15', 190, 1, 5, 367502) It is beyond the scope of these lines to distribute the blame, if there is any, on either side, or to examine the causes for the existence of such a state of things.
('15', 190, 1, 6, 367668) I have been obliged to advert to it to show that apart from all other considerations, the system of indentured labour is demonstrably so degrading to us as a nation that it must be stopped at any cost and that now.

('15', 190, 4, 9, 367949) February 26, 1916
('15', 190, 5, 10, 367967) About seven thousand people led by the Honble Mr. Bhurgri and the Honble Mr. Ghulam Hussein, both Mahomedan members of the Bombay Legislative Council, gave a public reception to Mr. Gandhi at Hyderabad and a procession of fifty carriages took three hours to pass through the crowded streets owing to numerous stops for Mr. Gandhi to be garlanded.
('15', 190, 5, 11, 368314) A eulogistic address in a sandalwood casket was presented to Mr. Gandhi at a public meeting, where all the speeches were in English except that of Mr. Gandhi, who preferred to speak in Hindustani.
('15', 190, 6, 12, 368511) Mr. Gandhi said that his political guru, the late Mr. Gokhale, had imposed on him one years silence and had bidden him to travel and see things.
('15', 190, 6, 13, 368656) The period had passed now and he could speak.
('15', 190, 6, 14, 368702) Self government for India was in the air.
('15', 190, 6, 15, 368744) A scheme was to be framed by the Congress and the League leaders at Allahabad, but how many knew what was wanted?
('15', 190, 6, 16, 368858) It could not be given and taken mechanically.
('15', 190, 6, 17, 368904) They could only get as much of swaraj as they fitted themselves for, they had to fulfil certain conditions and they could fulfil them.
('15', 190, 6, 18, 369039) One condition was that they should adopt swadeshi whole heartedly.
('15', 190, 6, 19, 369106) Swaraj and swadeshi must go together.
('15', 190, 6, 20, 369144) Then their motto should be Fear God rather than man, be the man King or Guru or Moulvi. Then they must treat their depressed and poor brethren as human beings.
('15', 190, 6, 21, 369304) Mr. Gandhi also reminded his hearers that they could best honour their leaders by copying the virtues which they ascribed to those leaders.
('15', 190, 6, 22, 369444) He concluded with an appeal for funds being raised for the Servants of India Society.
('15', 190, 7, 23, 369530) At the conclusion of his speech, he was loudly cheered.
('15', 190, 7, 24, 369586) At the end Vande Mataram and another national song of the famous Digambar 1 were sung, the audience standing.

('15', 191, 2, 3, 369817) February 27, 1916
('15', 191, 3, 4, 369835) On 27th February, l916, Gandhiji unveiled before a large gathering the portrait of the late Mr. G. K. Gokhale in the Holmstead Hall, Hyderabad (Sind).
('15', 191, 3, 5, 369986) The Collector was also amongst those present.
('15', 191, 4, 6, 370032) Mr. Gandhi, speaking Hindustani, said that character was the cornerstone of Mr. Gokhales work and success.
('15', 191, 4, 7, 370139) Not only public men, but Government officials, traders, clerks, coolies and others could elevate and serve the country if duty, and not authority or self, was the ruling motive.
('15', 191, 4, 8, 370317) Want of a sense of duty and the spirit of service caused their miseries.
('15', 191, 4, 9, 370390) Mr. Gokhale founded the Servants of India Society for development of character and he wanted to spiritualise political life.
('15', 191, 4, 10, 370515) The leaders must not seek praise but serve the country as a duty.
('15', 191, 4, 11, 370581) If I did not emulate the virtues of Mr. Gokhale, I would prove myself unworthy of this unveiling of his portrait.
('15', 191, 4, 12, 370695) And if you would not emulate his virtues, you would prove yourself unfit for joining in this ceremony.
('15', 191, 5, 13, 370798) In conclusion, Mr. Gandhi appealed for aid for the Servants of India Society.

('15', 191, 8, 16, 370948) February 28, 1916
('15', 191, 9, 17, 370966) During the course of the day, Mr. Gandhi visited the Narishala, Navalrai Hiranand Academy, Nava Vidyalaya High School, and Kundanmal Girls School.
('15', 191, 9, 18, 371113) In the afternoon, Mr. Gandhi was the guest of the Gujarati and Deccani residents of Hyderabad, who had assembled in the house of Mr. P. G. Mankad in Hirabag.
('15', 191, 9, 19, 371271) Mr. Gandhi was given an address and garlanded.
('15', 191, 9, 20, 371318) After that he drove to the Central Jail accompanied by Diwan Wadhumal Belaram and his brothers, and strange to say that the request made to the Superintendent to allow Mr. Gandhi to see the inside of the Jail was ungraciously refused by him for reasons best known to him.
('15', 191, 9, 21, 371590) Mr. Gandhi then went to the Holmstead Hall where he gave a short discourse on vaccination.
('15', 191, 10, 22, 371681) He said that he had not given special attention to the subject, but had bestowed some thought on it.
('15', 191, 10, 23, 371782) He thought as the vaccine serum was obtained by a process which spelt torture to the cow, vaccination contravened the fundamental principle of

('15', 192, 1, 2, 372018) Hinduism which is ahimsa.
('15', 192, 1, 3, 372044) He said that orthodox Hindus objected to vaccination, since injection through the arm was tantamount to taking through the mouth.
('15', 192, 1, 4, 372174) He then said that vaccination with human lymph was open to objection not only on the same grounds, but also because it involved the risk of contracting infectious diseases.
('15', 192, 1, 5, 372347) He said that it was not a fact that all those who were not vaccinated were attacked with small pox, nor that those who were so attacked succumbed to it.
('15', 192, 1, 6, 372500) He further stated that it was left to the choice of every individual to go in for vaccination or not.
('15', 192, 1, 7, 372602) But if the law of compulsory vaccination was in force in a place and if some person objected to vaccination on religious grounds, every Indian should stand by him, for compulsion in one form might lead to compulsion in other directions also.

('15', 192, 4, 10, 372950) February 29, 1916
('15', 192, 5, 11, 372968) In reply to the welcome address presented by the Citizens Association, Karachi, on February 29, 1916, Mr. Gandhi spoke in Hindi to the following effect: I have been travelling in various parts of India, and in the course of my travels, I have been struck with the fact that throughout India the hearts of the people are in a special degree drawn towards me.
('15', 192, 5, 12, 373326) All brothers of Hindustan without distinction of creed or caste have been showing this attachment.
('15', 192, 5, 13, 373425) But I feel convinced that this remarkable attachment to me is meant not for me but as a fitting tribute of admiration to all those noble brothers and sisters of ours in South Africa, who underwent such immense trouble and sacrifices including incarceration in jails for the service of the Motherland.
('15', 192, 5, 14, 373726) It is undoubtedly this consideration which leads you to be so very kind to me.
('15', 192, 5, 15, 373805) It was they who won the struggle and it was by reason of their unflinching determination to do or die that so much was achieved.
('15', 192, 5, 16, 373934) Hence I take it that whatever tribute is paid to me, is in reality and in truth paid to them.
('15', 192, 6, 17, 374028) In the course of my tour in India, I have been particularly struck with one thing and that is the awakening of the Indian people.
('15', 192, 6, 18, 374158) A new hope has filled the hearts of the people, hope that something is
('15', 192, 7, 19, 374229) 1The Bombay Chronicle, 1 3 19l6, in its brief report had here: He recommended passive resistance on the part of those having religious objection and said that the public should support those who were prepared for going to jail.
('15', 193, 0, 1, 374457) 194 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 193, 1, 2, 374499) going to happen which will raise the Motherland to a higher status.
('15', 193, 1, 3, 374567) But side by side with this spirit of hope, I also had amongst my country men, awe not only of the Government but also of heads of castes and the priestly class.
('15', 193, 1, 4, 374728) As a result of this, we are afraid to speak out what is in us.
('15', 193, 1, 5, 374791) So long as this spirit remains, there will be, and there can be, no true progress.
('15', 193, 1, 6, 374874) You know that at the last session of the Congress, a re solution was passed about self government.
('15', 193, 1, 7, 374973) For the attainment of that ideal, you and I, all of us, must work and persevere.
('15', 193, 1, 8, 375054) In pursuance of that resolution, the Committees of the Congress and the Moslem League will soon meet together and they will decide what they think proper.
('15', 193, 1, 9, 375209) But the attainment of self government depends not on their saying or doing anything but upon what you and I do.
('15', 193, 1, 10, 375321) Here in Karachi, commerce is predominant and there are many big merchants.
('15', 193, 1, 11, 375396) To them, I wish to address a few words.
('15', 193, 1, 12, 375436) It is a misapprehension to think that there is no scope in commerce for serving the Mother country.
('15', 193, 1, 13, 375536) If they are inspired by the spirit of truth, merchants can be immensely useful tothe country.
('15', 193, 1, 14, 375630) The salvation of our country, remember, is not in the hands of others but of ourselves, and more in the hands of merchants in some respects than the educated people; for I s trongly feel that so long as there is no swadeshism, there can be no self government (Hear, hear), and for the spread of swadeshism Indian merchants are in a position to do a very great deal.
('15', 193, 1, 15, 375996) The swadeshi wave passed through the country at one time.
('15', 193, 1, 16, 376054) But I understand that the movement had collapsed largely because Indian merchants had palmed off foreign goods as swadeshi articles.
('15', 193, 1, 17, 376187) By Indian merchants being honest and straightforward in their business, they could achieve a great deal for the regeneration and uplift of the country.
('15', 193, 1, 18, 376339) Hence merchants should faithfully observe what Hindus call dharma and Mohammedans call iman 1 in their business transactions.
('15', 193, 1, 19, 376465) Then shall India be uplifted.
('15', 193, 1, 20, 376495) In South Africa, our merchants rendered valuable help in the struggle and yet because some of them weakened, the struggle was prolonged somewhat.
('15', 193, 1, 21, 376641) It is the duty of the educated classes to mix freely with Indian merchants and the poor classes.
('15', 193, 1, 22, 376738) Then will our journey to the common and cherished goal be less irksome.

('15', 194, 3, 4, 376991) Unveiling the portrait of Gokhale at the Khalihdina Hall, Karachi, on Tuesday
('15', 194, 4, 5, 377069) the 29th February 1916, Mahatma Gandhi spoke as follows:
('15', 194, 5, 6, 377126) In Hyderabad, Sind, also, I was asked to unveil a portrait of Mr. Gokhale; and there I put to myself and to those present a question which I put to myself and to you now.
('15', 194, 5, 7, 377297) That question is: What right have I to unveil the portrait of Mr. Gokhale and what right have you to join in the ceremony?
('15', 194, 5, 8, 377420) Of course, to unveil a portrait or to join in it is nothing great or important in itself.
('15', 194, 5, 9, 377510) But the question really involved in the ceremony is important, viz., are your hearts and is my heart in reality so much moved as to copy the glorious example of the great man?
('15', 194, 5, 10, 377686) The function will have no real significance unless we follow in his footsteps.
('15', 194, 5, 11, 377765) And if we do follow him, we shall be able to achieve a great deal.
('15', 194, 5, 12, 377832) Of course, it is not possible for all of us to achieve what Mr. Gokhale did in the Imperial Legislative Council.
('15', 194, 5, 13, 377945) But the way in which he served the Motherland, the whole hearted devotion with which he did it day and night without ceasing all this it is in our power to do as the great one did.
('15', 194, 5, 14, 378126) And I hope that when you leave this hall, you will bear in mind to follow him and the give expression to your regard for him.
('15', 194, 5, 15, 378252) You know that the best achievement of Mr. Gokhale according to himself was the establishment of the Servants of India Society.
('15', 194, 5, 16, 378379) This great institution he has left behind him; and it lies with us to support it and continue its noble work.
('15', 194, 5, 17, 378489) It would be best if we could join the Society.
('15', 194, 5, 18, 378536) But that will involve the question of our being fit for it.
('15', 194, 5, 19, 378596) But if we are not in a position to join the Society, we can all do the next best thing, viz., render pecuniary aid and swell the funds of the Society.

('15', 195, 2, 3, 378868) February 29, 1916
('15', 195, 3, 4, 378886) I am very grateful to the friends from Gujarat for the honour they have done me today.
('15', 195, 3, 5, 378973) Wherever I have gone, Gujaratis have welcomed me as they have done here.
('15', 195, 3, 6, 379046) They are more my neighboursthough all the people in the country are my neighbours and I wish therefore to be of special service to them.
('15', 195, 3, 7, 379183) However, I must tour the whole of India and it would not be right for me, therefore, to stay in Gujarat all the time.
('15', 195, 3, 8, 379301) I have observed that Gujaratis have spread out as far as Calcutta, to the Madras as well as the Bengal Presidency for purposes of business.
('15', 195, 3, 9, 379441) Even in South Africa, the major part of the business community is from Gujarat.
('15', 195, 3, 10, 379521) In Karachi, the Gujarati population is much larger than at any of these places, so much so that, though the Sindhis are in a majority here, Karachi being a part of Sind, at first sight it might appear that the Gujarati population in the city was larger than the Sindhi.
('15', 195, 3, 11, 379791) There are three communities in GujaratGujarati Hindus, Gujarati Parsis and Gujarati Muslims, and all these three have spread over different parts of the country, most of them for business.
('15', 195, 3, 12, 379980) It is not the right way for a business man merely to earn and lay by money and get rich anyhow by exploiting the poor.
('15', 195, 3, 13, 380099) In that way, even the Pindaris used to get wealthy by robbing people.
('15', 195, 3, 14, 380169) I see no difference between a man who cheats in business and one who slaps another and forces him to partwith his money.
('15', 195, 3, 15, 380290) Business men should follow truth in their business and not bear hard on people through their operations.
('15', 195, 3, 16, 380395) I dont mean to suggest that this is what you do in your business.
('15', 195, 3, 17, 380461) Whenever you may have committed sins, you must have felt the fear of God as well and you must have done kindness, too, now and then.
('15', 195, 3, 18, 380594) It should be the chief aim of a business man to study this virtue of kindness.
('15', 195, 3, 19, 380673) Our education is no education if it only makes us physicians or lawyers.
('15', 195, 3, 20, 380746) We should try to develop our business.
('15', 195, 3, 21, 380785) One living example of this is provided by Sir Dorab 2 and Ratan Tata.
('15', 195, 3, 22, 380855) Sir Dorab does not educate any of his sons for the profession of a physician or a lawyer.
('15', 195, 3, 23, 380945) He will perhaps have quite a number of such physicians in his

('15', 196, 1, 4, 381375) India has none to equal this man.
('15', 196, 1, 5, 381409) Mr. Chamberlain of Birmingham was also a true business man and, though he is no more, his memory is still cherished in the business world.
('15', 196, 1, 6, 381548) Business men may protest and say that they only know business and do not meddle with other things.
('15', 196, 1, 7, 381647) They should not, however, take up any such attitude.
('15', 196, 1, 8, 381700) They, too, should be in tune with the atmosphere around them.
('15', 196, 1, 9, 381762) In fact, the very scriptures of Muslims, Hindus and Parsis enjoin them to serve the people while they carry on their business.
('15', 196, 1, 10, 381889) He is no worthy business man who, in times of famine, raises the prices so high that the people simply break down.
('15', 196, 1, 11, 382004) This kind of thing ruins both the people and the business men.
('15', 196, 1, 12, 382067) The failure of the swadeshi movement is also to be attributed to the business men.
('15', 196, 1, 13, 382150) Everyone blames it on the Bombay Presidency where the people, keen only on making money, took no interest in promoting the sale of swadeshi goods.
('15', 196, 1, 14, 382297) Just as the Kshatriyas duty is not killing [but protecting], so also the business mans duty is not amassing wealth.

('15', 196, 11, 26, 382931) True, public life in Madras is quite on a large scale but this is due to the much greater student population there.

('15', 197, 1, 3, 383225) It does not seem to be so in Madras.
('15', 197, 1, 4, 383262) In the whole of India, it is in Poona that we come across persons from among whom a large number may emerge one day as leaders of the masses.
('15', 197, 1, 5, 383404) In Bombay, things are so.
('15', 197, 1, 6, 383430) Public life there depends on only one or two gentlemen.
('15', 197, 1, 7, 383486) It is the charge of outsiders against Sind that its people are apathetic.
('15', 197, 1, 8, 383560) I dont think so.
('15', 197, 1, 9, 383577) There is as much public spirit in this province as in any other.
('15', 197, 1, 10, 383642) I think the public spirit in Sind will excel that of Bombay.

('15', 197, 11, 24, 384463) My life here is curious.
('15', 197, 11, 25, 384488) I feel like a stranger in the midst of so many who think they know me.
('15', 197, 11, 26, 384559) There is kinship only to a certain extent.
('15', 197, 11, 27, 384602) Everything I say pleases often, sometimes wounds, rarely convinces and still more rarely is conviction followed by action.
('15', 197, 11, 28, 384725) All this you will see some day when peace takes the place of this seeming never to be ending war.
('15', 197, 11, 29, 384823) But I am quite happy in my aloofness.

('15', 198, 1, 2, 384903) that I am right.
('15', 198, 1, 3, 384920) It is this inner happiness which I would like you to have.
('15', 198, 1, 4, 384979) And your present position is just the experience that should give you the happiness I have described.
('15', 198, 1, 5, 385081) You have leisure for introspection and no worry save what you will give yourself.
('15', 198, 1, 6, 385163) Man does not live by bread alone. Animal enjoyment is the least part of ones life.
('15', 198, 1, 7, 385246) But we have made it the most important of all indeed in some cases it has become the only important part of life.
('15', 198, 1, 8, 385360) This ought to be changed.
('15', 198, 1, 9, 385386) Each one of us can do it in our own case.
('15', 198, 1, 10, 385428) Will you not use your opportunity?
('15', 198, 1, 11, 385463) Ramdas is now better.
('15', 198, 1, 12, 385485) He is not yet sufficiently acclimatized.
('15', 198, 1, 13, 385526) That accounts for his indifferent health.
('15', 198, 1, 14, 385568) He is, however, gaining ground and is likely to be all right in a short time.
('15', 198, 1, 15, 385646) Fakiri is still far from well.
('15', 198, 1, 16, 385677) He does cause anxiety.
('15', 198, 1, 17, 385700) He is unable to restrain his palate.

('15', 198, 4, 22, 385887) Saturday [March 11, 1916] 1
('15', 198, 5, 23, 385915) MAGANLAL, Herewith a letter 2 received here.
('15', 198, 5, 24, 385960) Enclosed with it was an advertisement, which I need not send on.
('15', 198, 5, 25, 386025) I shall leave on the 15th instead of on the 14th.
('15', 198, 5, 26, 386075) I am thinking of taking along both Devdas and Prabhudas.
('15', 198, 5, 27, 386132) Ramdas will of course be there.
('15', 198, 5, 28, 386164) You must put your heart in Tamil and get through with it.
('15', 198, 5, 29, 386222) Shivram has left and there is no one to attend to Tamil now.
('15', 198, 5, 30, 386283) I think, therefore, that the thing can be done only when one of us gets trained up.
('15', 198, 5, 31, 386367) At present, I can only think of you.
('15', 198, 5, 32, 386404) I have it in my mind to send others also to learn Tamil.
('15', 198, 5, 33, 386461) It seems that Anna will not come at all.
('15', 198, 5, 34, 386502) Soyabeans are grown in India.
('15', 198, 5, 35, 386532) I saw the grain in the farms in Sind.
('15', 198, 5, 36, 386570) They sell there whatever seed we want.
('15', 198, 6, 37, 386609) 1 Gandhiji was in Sind from February 26, l916 and in Karachi on March 2, 1916. He reached Hardwar on the 14th accompanied by Ramdas, Devdas and Prabhudas, Chhaganlal Gandhis son.
('15', 198, 6, 38, 386788) The letter seems to have been written a little before that date.

('15', 199, 1, 3, 386944) Does he, too, go ahead with Tamil?
('15', 199, 1, 4, 386979) Call on the Reverends Simon and Lazarus.
('15', 199, 1, 5, 387020) I am sure you will find among the Christians someone who will be ready to teach.
('15', 199, 1, 6, 387101) If you have gone far enough, make it a practice to read a newspaper.
('15', 199, 1, 7, 387170) Krishnasami, it seems, lives there.
('15', 199, 1, 8, 387206) He is penitent, indeed.

('15', 199, 7, 14, 387438) DEAR MAGANBHAI, I cannot forget Fakiri.
('15', 199, 7, 15, 387478) We have a lot to learn from his death.
('15', 199, 7, 16, 387517) I shall write about it when I have the leisure.
('15', 199, 7, 17, 387565) I shall definitely be here till the 20th, and maybe till the 21st.
('15', 199, 7, 18, 387632) The subsequent programme has not yet been fixed.
('15', 199, 7, 19, 387681) Manilal will have gone to Ajmer.
('15', 199, 7, 20, 387714) If not, he should go at once.

('15', 199, 12, 25, 387969) March 18, 1916
('15', 199, 13, 26, 387984) Even if Nanak Chand had not told us that the gotras of the Untouchables are the same as those of other Rajputs, even then we would not consider them untouchables.
('15', 199, 13, 27, 388147) For it is our duty to love all.
('15', 199, 14, 28, 388179) 1 Gandhiji had stayed at Gurukul Kangri from March 14 to 20, 1916. Friday during this period fell on March 17.

('15', 200, 1, 2, 388332) Sir Sankaran Nair told me we had lost India through inequity to the Untouchables.
('15', 200, 1, 3, 388414) I believe it so.
('15', 200, 1, 4, 388431) We shall realize it if someone else gave us the same disgraceful treatment.
('15', 200, 1, 5, 388507) No, we have really sinned grievously.
('15', 200, 1, 6, 388545) For the sake of our souls, our own good, must we repent and be restored.
('15', 200, 1, 7, 388618) We must undergo a prayaschit.
('15', 200, 1, 8, 388648) And what is the prayaschit?
('15', 200, 1, 9, 388676) What is the practical solution?
('15', 200, 1, 10, 388708) I can tell you that in a minute.
('15', 200, 1, 11, 388741) First, we must clearly realize that we have to attain not their salvation but ours by treating them as equals, by admitting them to our schools, etc.
('15', 200, 1, 12, 388891) We only copy the missionaries.
('15', 200, 1, 13, 388922) To those responsible for the active working out of the question, I would suggest simply to think and act more seriously and sincerely and find out what ought to be done.

('15', 200, 4, 16, 389158) Thursday, Phagan 15 [March 19, 1916] 1
('15', 200, 5, 17, 389197) BHAISHRI MAGANBHAI, I have your letter.
('15', 200, 5, 18, 389237) You are worked up.
('15', 200, 5, 19, 389256) You have done well in expressing to me what you feel deeply.
('15', 200, 5, 20, 389317) We have to act only according to our capacity.
('15', 200, 5, 21, 389364) If therefore you cannot follow the pattern of life at the Ashram, it is only proper that you should leave.
('15', 200, 5, 22, 389471) It is futile to think about south Africa.
('15', 200, 5, 23, 389513) You are physically not fit for a long journey.
('15', 200, 5, 24, 389560) Then, Mr. Polak is not certain about himself.
('15', 200, 5, 25, 389606) He is in an awkward situation.
('15', 200, 5, 26, 389637) I am sure you can do nothing there.
('15', 200, 5, 27, 389673) You cannot join the Servants of India Society with a view to earning money.
('15', 200, 5, 28, 389749) There is only one way of earning money, which everyone else follows.
('15', 200, 5, 29, 389818) In your case your health is a hindrance.
('15', 200, 5, 30, 389859) My opinion is that unless you had resorted to stealing you could not have earned more money openly than you have been able to earn through the Satyagraha Movement.
('15', 200, 5, 31, 390023) It cannot be said that your economic condition would have been better if you had not joined the struggle.
('15', 200, 5, 32, 390129) Hence, if you cannot continue in the Ashram with a firm mind, you must explain the situation to your father.
('15', 200, 5, 33, 390238) You must stay at home and agree to whatever solution your father suggests.
('15', 200, 5, 34, 390313) You must follow his wishes and do as he says, whatever the gain may be.
('15', 200, 5, 35, 390385) For your trouble,
('15', 200, 6, 36, 390403) 1 From the reference to Fakiris death it would appear that this letter was written in 1916; vide the preceding item.

('15', 201, 1, 2, 390603) you should do as he says.
('15', 201, 1, 3, 390629) In the end even doing this will take you forward.
('15', 201, 1, 4, 390679) Even in this kind of self indulgence there is spiritual sublimity.
('15', 201, 1, 5, 390746) I feel much sympathy for you.
('15', 201, 1, 6, 390776) It is as difficult for you to leave the Ashram as it is to continue there.
('15', 201, 1, 7, 390851) Nobody else is in a situation like yours.
('15', 201, 1, 8, 390893) Think maturely.
('15', 201, 1, 9, 390909) I am abandoning the idea going to the Punjab and other places.
('15', 201, 1, 10, 390972) I hope to reach there by Saturday evening or latest by Sunday.
('15', 201, 1, 11, 391035) We shall talk when we meet about what I have been feeling about Fakiris death.
('15', 201, 1, 12, 391114) I can understand that your wife cannot work.
('15', 201, 1, 13, 391159) She has come this time with an ulterior motive.
('15', 201, 1, 14, 391207) There really is a snare laid for you.

('15', 201, 6, 19, 391398) March 20, 1916
('15', 201, 7, 20, 391413) These village schools have, I find, no common educational standard.
('15', 201, 7, 21, 391481) Some are doing as good work as the schools for the rich but some impart very poor education.
('15', 201, 7, 22, 391574) To be fair to the Untouchables, one must send ones own children to such schools for depressed classes and make sure that the educational standard is not allowed to fall low.
('15', 201, 7, 23, 391748) But one thing more.
('15', 201, 7, 24, 391768) Let not the education be such as to transform these village workers into khansamas, dirty hands, petty sub clerks in unhealthy towns.
('15', 201, 7, 25, 391902) Let the education enable them to follow the occupations of their fathers, to follow them more scientifically, to follow them with greater skill.
('15', 201, 7, 26, 392047) Let the schools create an attachment for village life, for village crafts, for open air independence and for service among our own.

('15', 202, 1, 2, 392297) 153. SPEECH AT GURUKUL ANNIVERSARY
('15', 202, 2, 3, 392332) March 20, 1916
('15', 202, 3, 4, 392347) The following is the text of Mr. Gandhis speech at the anniversary of the Gurukul, as written out by himself: I propose to reproduce only as much of it as in my opinion is worth placing on record with additions where they may be found necessary.
('15', 202, 3, 5, 392593) The speech, it may be observed, was delivered in Hindi.
('15', 202, 3, 6, 392649) After thanking Mahatmaji Munshi Ram for his great kindness to my boys to whom he gave shelter on two occasions and acted as father to them and after stating that the time for action had arrived rather than for speeches, I proceeded: I owe a debt of gratitude to the Arya Samaj.
('15', 202, 3, 7, 392927) I have often derived inspiration from its activity.
('15', 202, 3, 8, 392979) I have noticed among the members of the Samaj much self sacrifice.
('15', 202, 3, 9, 393046) During my travels in India, I came across many Arya Samajists who were doing excellent work for the country.
('15', 202, 3, 10, 393155) I am therefore grateful to Mahatmaji, that I am enabled to be in your midst.
('15', 202, 3, 11, 393232) At the same time, it is but fair to state that I am frankly a Sanatanist.
('15', 202, 3, 12, 393306) For me Hinduism is all sufficing.
('15', 202, 3, 13, 393340) Every variety of belief finds protection under its ample fold.
('15', 202, 3, 14, 393403) And though the Arya Samajists and the Sikhs and the Brahmo Samajists may choose to be classed differently from the Hindus, I have no doubt that at no distant future they will be all merged in Hinduism and find in it their fullness.
('15', 202, 3, 15, 393635) Hinduism, like every other human institution, has its drawbacks and its defects.
('15', 202, 3, 16, 393716) Here is ample scope for any worker to strive for reform, but there is little cause for secession.
('15', 202, 4, 17, 393814) SPIRIT OF FEARLESSNESS Throughout my travels, I have been asked about the immediate need for India.
('15', 202, 4, 18, 393914) And, perhaps, I would not do better than repeat this afternoon the answer I have given elsewhere.
('15', 202, 4, 19, 394012) In general terms, a proper religious spirit is the greatest and most immediate need.
('15', 202, 4, 20, 394097) But I know that this is too general an answer to satisfy anybody.
('15', 202, 4, 21, 394163) And it is an answer true for all time.
('15', 202, 4, 22, 394202) What, therefore, I desire to say is, that owing to the religious spirit being dormant in us, we are living in a state of perpetual fear.
('15', 202, 4, 23, 394339) We fear the temporal as well as the spiritual authority.
('15', 202, 4, 24, 394396) We dare not speak out our minds before our priests and our pandits.
('15', 202, 4, 25, 394464) We stand in awe of the temporal power.
('15', 202, 4, 26, 394503) I am sure that in so doing we do a disservice to them and us.
('15', 202, 4, 27, 394565) Neither the spiritual teachers nor our
('15', 203, 0, 1, 394604) 204 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 203, 1, 2, 394646) political governors could possibly desire that we should hide the truth from them.
('15', 203, 1, 3, 394729) Lord Wellington, speaking to a Bombay audience, has been saying recently that he had observed that we hesitated to say No when we really meant it and advised his audience to cultivate a fearless spirit.
('15', 203, 1, 4, 394932) Of course, fearlessness should never mean want of due respect or regard for the feelings of others.
('15', 203, 1, 5, 395032) In my humble opinion, fearlessness is the first thing indispensable before we could achieve anything permanent and real.
('15', 203, 1, 6, 395153) This quality is unattainable without religious consciousness.
('15', 203, 1, 7, 395215) Let us fear God and we shall cease to fear man.
('15', 203, 1, 8, 395263) If we grasp the fact that there is a divinity within us which witnesses everything we think or do and which protects us and guides us along the true path, it is clear that we shall cease to have any other fear on the face I if the earth, save the fear of God.
('15', 203, 1, 9, 395523) Loyalty to the Governor of governors supersedes all other loyalty and gives an intelligent basis to the latter.
('15', 203, 2, 10, 395635) MEANING OF SWADESHI
('15', 203, 3, 11, 395655) And when we have sufficiently cultivated this spirit of fearlessness, we shall see that there is no salvation for us without true swadeshi, not the swadeshi which can be conveniently put off.
('15', 203, 3, 12, 395847) Swadeshi for me has a deeper meaning.
('15', 203, 3, 13, 395885) I would like us to apply it in our religious, political and economic life.
('15', 203, 3, 14, 395960) It is not, therefore, merely confined to wearing on occasion swadeshi cloth.
('15', 203, 3, 15, 396037) That we have to do for all time, not out of a spirit of jealousy or revenge, but because it is a duty we owe to our dear country.
('15', 203, 3, 16, 396167) We commit a breach of the swadeshi spirit certainly if we wear foreign made cloth, but we do so also if we adopt the foreign cut.
('15', 203, 3, 17, 396297) Surely, the style of our dress has some correspondence with our environment.
('15', 203, 3, 18, 396374) In elegance and tastefulness, it is immeasurably superior to the trousers and the jacket.
('15', 203, 3, 19, 396464) An Indian, wearing a shirt flowing over his pyjamas with a waist coat on it without a necktie and its flaps hanging loose behind, is not a very graceful spectacle.
('15', 203, 3, 20, 396628) Swadeshi in religion teaches one to measure the glorious past and re enact it in the present generation.
('15', 203, 3, 21, 396733) The pandemonium that is going on in Europe shows that modern civilization represents forces of evil and darkness, whereas the ancient, i.
('15', 203, 3, 22, 396871) e., Indian, civilization represents in its essence the divine force.
('15', 203, 3, 23, 396940) Modern civilization is chiefly materialistic, as ours is chiefly spiritual.
('15', 203, 3, 24, 397016) Modern civilization occupies self in the investigation of the laws of matter, and employs human ingenuity in inventing of discovering means of production and weapons of destruction; ours is chiefly
('15', 204, 0, 1, 397214) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 205
('15', 204, 1, 2, 397256) occupied in exploring spiritual laws.
('15', 204, 1, 3, 397294) Our shastras lay down unequivocally that a proper observance of truth, chastity, scrupulous regard for all life, abstention from coveting others possessions and refusal to hoard anything but what is necessary for our daily wants is indispensable for a right life; that without it a knowledge of the divine element is an impossibility.
('15', 204, 1, 4, 397629) Our civilization tells us with daring certainty that a proper and perfect cultivation of the quality of ahimsa which, in its active form means purest love and pity, brings the whole world to our feet.
('15', 204, 1, 5, 397830) The author of this discovery gives a wealth of illustration which carries conviction with it.
('15', 204, 2, 6, 397924) THE DOCTRINE OF AHIMSA Examine its result in the political life.
('15', 204, 2, 7, 397989) There is no gift so valued by our shastras as the gift of life.
('15', 204, 2, 8, 398053) Consider what our relations would be with our rulers if we gave absolute security of life to them.
('15', 204, 2, 9, 398152) If they could but feel that, no matter what we might feel about their acts, we would hold their bodies as sacred as our own, there would immediately spring up an atmosphere of mutual trust, and there would be such frankness on either side as to pave the way for an honourable and just solution of many problems that worry us today.
('15', 204, 2, 10, 398484) It should be remembered that in practising ahimsa, there need not be any reciprocation, though, as a matter of fact, in its final stages, it commands reciprocation.
('15', 204, 2, 11, 398649) Many of us believe, and I am one of them, that through our civilization we have a message to deliver to the world.
('15', 204, 2, 12, 398764) I render my loyalty to the British Government quite selfishly.
('15', 204, 2, 13, 398827) I would like to use the British race for transmitting this mighty message of ahimsa to the whole world.
('15', 204, 2, 14, 398931) But that can only be done when we have conquered our so called conquerors; and you, my Arya Samaj friends, are perhaps specially elected for this mission.
('15', 204, 2, 15, 399086) You claim to examine our scriptures critically; you take nothing for granted and you claim not to fear to reduce your belief to practice.
('15', 204, 2, 16, 399224) I do not think that there is any room for trifling with or limiting the doctrine of ahimsa.
('15', 204, 2, 17, 399316) You dare, then, to reduce it to practice regardless of immediate consequences which would certainly test the strength of your convictions.
('15', 204, 2, 18, 399455) You would not only produce salvation for India, but you would render the noblest service that a man can render to humanitya service moreover, which you would rightly assert the great Swami 1 was born for.
('15', 204, 2, 19, 399660) This swadeshi is to be considered as a very active force to be ceaselessly employed with an ever increasing

('15', 205, 1, 3, 399870) It is not meant for the lazy, but it is essentially meant for them who would gladly lay down their lives for the sake of truth.
('15', 205, 1, 4, 399998) It is possible to dilate upon several other phases of swadeshi, but I think I have said enough to enable you to understand what I mean.
('15', 205, 1, 5, 400134) I only hope that you, who represent a school of reformers in India, will not reject what 1 have said without thorough examination.
('15', 205, 1, 6, 400265) And, if my word has commended itself to you, your past record entitles me to expect you to enforce in your own lives the things of eternity about which I have ventured to speak to you this afternoon, and cover the whole of India with your activity.
('15', 205, 2, 7, 400514) WORK OF THE ARYA SAMAJ
('15', 205, 3, 8, 400537) In concluding my report of the above speech, I would like to state what I did not in speaking to that great audience and it is this.
('15', 205, 3, 9, 400670) I have now twice visited the Gurukul.
('15', 205, 3, 10, 400708) In spite of some vital difference with my brethren of the Arya Samaj, I have a sneaking regard for them, and it, and perhaps the best result of the activity of the Arya Samaj is to be seen in the establishment and the conduct of the Gurukul.
('15', 205, 3, 11, 400950) Though it depends for its vitality entirely upon the inspiring presence of Mahatmaji Munshi Ram, it is truly a national and self governing and self governed institution.
('15', 205, 3, 12, 401120) It is totally independent of Government aid or patronage.
('15', 205, 3, 13, 401178) Its war chest is filled not out of monies received from the privileged few, but from the poor many who make it a point of honour from year to year to make a pilgrimage to Kangri and willingly give their mite for maintaining this National College.
('15', 205, 3, 14, 401425) Here at every anniversary a huge crowd gathers and the manner in which it is handled, housed and fed evinces no mean power of organisation.
('15', 205, 3, 15, 401565) But the most wonderful thing about it all is that the crowd consisting of about the thousand men, women and children is managed without the assistance of a single policeman and without any fuss or semblance of force, the only force that subsists between the crowd and the managers of the institution is that of love and mutual esteem.
('15', 205, 3, 16, 401900) Fourteen years are nothing in the life of a big institution like this.
('15', 205, 3, 17, 401971) What the collegiates who have been just turned out during the last two or three years will be able to show, remains to be seen.
('15', 205, 3, 18, 402099) The public will not and cannot judge men or institutions except through the results that they show.
('15', 205, 3, 19, 402199) It makes no allowance for failures, it is a most exacting judge.
('15', 205, 3, 20, 402264) The final appeal of the Gurukul as of all popular institutions must be to this judge.
('15', 205, 3, 21, 402350) Great responsibility therefore rests upon the shoulders of the students who have been discharged from
('15', 206, 0, 1, 402452) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 207
('15', 206, 1, 2, 402494) the college and who have entered upon the thorny path of life.
('15', 206, 1, 3, 402557) Let them beware.
('15', 206, 1, 4, 402574) Meanwhile hose who are well wishers of this great experiment may derive satisfaction from the fact that we have it as an indisputable rule of life, that as the tree is, so will the fruit be.
('15', 206, 1, 5, 402765) The tree looks lovely enough.
('15', 206, 1, 6, 402795) He who waters it is a noble soul.
('15', 206, 1, 7, 402829) Why worry about what the fruit is likely to be?
('15', 206, 2, 8, 402877) INDUSTRIAL TRAINING
('15', 206, 3, 9, 402897) As a lover of the Gurukul, I may be permitted to offer one or two suggestions to the Committee and the parents.
('15', 206, 3, 10, 403009) The Gurukul boys need a thorough industrial training if they are to become self reliant and self supporting.
('15', 206, 3, 11, 403118) It seems to me that in our country in which 85 per cent of the population is agricultural and perhaps 10 per cent occupied in supplying the wants of the peasantry, it must be part of the training of every youth that he has a fair practical knowledge of agriculture and hand weaving.
('15', 206, 3, 12, 403401) He will lose nothing if he knows a proper use of tools, can saw a piece of board straight and build a wall that will not come down through a faulty handling of the plumbers line.
('15', 206, 3, 13, 403580) A boy who is thus equipped will never feel helpless in battling with the world and never be in want of employment.
('15', 206, 3, 14, 403695) A knowledge of the laws of hygiene and sanitation as well as the art of rearing children should also form a necessary part of [the training of] the Gurukul lads.
('15', 206, 3, 15, 403857) The sanitary arrangements at the fair left much to be desired.
('15', 206, 3, 16, 403920) The plague of flies told its own tale.
('15', 206, 3, 17, 403959) These irrepressible sanitary inspectors incessantly warned us that in point of sanitation all was not well with us.
('15', 206, 3, 18, 404075) They plainly suggested that the remains of our food and excreta needed to be properly buried.
('15', 206, 3, 19, 404169) It seemed to me to be such a pity that a golden opportunity was being missed of giving to the annual visitors practical lessons on sanitation.
('15', 206, 3, 20, 404312) But the work must begin with the boys.
('15', 206, 3, 21, 404351) Then the management would have at the annual gathering three hundred practical sanitary teachers.
('15', 206, 3, 22, 404449) Last but not least, let the parents and the Committee not spoil their lads by making them ape European dress or modern luxuries.
('15', 206, 3, 23, 404578) These will hinder them in their afterlife and are antagonistic to brahmacharya.
('15', 206, 3, 24, 404658) They have enough to fight against in the evil inclinations common to us all.
('15', 206, 3, 25, 404735) Let us not make their fight more difficult by adding to their temptations.

('15', 207, 3, 4, 404945) The Dayanand Anglo Vedic School boys were taken to the Arya Samaj hall in the evening and Mr. Gandhi addressed them for a short time only as he was feeling unwell.
('15', 207, 4, 5, 405109) He exhorted the audience to have the courage of their convictions, and in copying or imitating those who directed or ruled, not to be guided by outward show, such as styles, dress, or by customs, such as meat eating.
('15', 207, 4, 6, 405326) He exhorted them to be true to themselves and then they would be true to India.

('15', 207, 6, 9, 405468) March 30, 1916
('15', 207, 7, 10, 405483) DEAR MR. PETIT, I have your letter covering check for Rs. 500 on a/c of passive resistance expenses for which I thank you.
('15', 207, 7, 11, 405606) I enclose herewith statement required by you.
('15', 207, 7, 12, 405652) It is not [the] final list.
('15', 207, 7, 13, 405680) For instance, the widows sometimes require travelling expenses.
('15', 207, 7, 14, 405744) These are allowed when necessary.
('15', 207, 7, 15, 405778) Such expenses were incurred only two months ago.
('15', 207, 7, 16, 405827) Imam Saheb has just lost his father and he was paid Rs. 300. He has not only lost all he had but he has incurred much odium from his erstwhile friends.
('15', 207, 7, 17, 405979) The result is that he has lost the trade he used to carry on.
('15', 207, 7, 18, 406041) He is now here.
('15', 207, 7, 19, 406057) Until he is suited it may be necessary to give him help from time to time.
('15', 207, 7, 20, 406132) Maganlal Gandhi and his brothers are my nephews.
('15', 207, 7, 21, 406181) They are training under me for national service.
('15', 207, 7, 22, 406230) One of the brothers 1 who is free is earning but not enough to bear the whole burden of supporting the parents.
('15', 207, 7, 23, 406342) Maganbhai Patels is a similar case.
('15', 207, 7, 24, 406378) Moreover, he is a chronic sickbed.
('15', 207, 7, 25, 406413) Then there is the case of Sorabji Adajania.
('15', 207, 7, 26, 406457) He holds from a friend a scholarship.
('15', 207, 7, 27, 406495) But owing to unforeseen circumstances he may need additional help up to say [Rs.] 500.

('15', 208, 2, 4, 406852) I need hardly say that the information I am giving you is confidential.
('15', 208, 2, 5, 406924) It relates to some public spirited men who are accepting support after pressure from me.
('15', 208, 2, 6, 407013) The rule has been never to disclose the names of those who have been receiving maintenance money.
('15', 208, 2, 7, 407111) The only person apart from the few intimate co workers in S.A. who knew anything about the support given was Mr. Gokhale.

('15', 209, 2, 3, 407771) FROM M.K. GANDHI AHMEDABAD, April 1 [1916] 1
('15', 209, 3, 4, 407816) MY DEAR FRIEND, I am at last in Ahmedabad, for some weeks at any rate.Your things are now being collected.
('15', 209, 3, 5, 407923) The next mail you should receive them.
('15', 209, 3, 6, 407962) I am trying to manufacture biscuits without an oven.
('15', 209, 3, 7, 408015) You will like them.
('15', 209, 3, 8, 408035) I never previous to the letter under reply received any letter regarding your things.
('15', 209, 3, 9, 408121) I never received the wooden pillow you have referred to in several letters of yours.
('15', 209, 3, 10, 408206) During the week I resolved not to admit to the Ashram for one year anyone either young or old.
('15', 209, 3, 11, 408301) Newcomers have taxed me too much and they have disturbed the ever tenor of the life of the Ashram.
('15', 209, 3, 12, 408400) I know you would have, had you been here, long ago pushed me to this decision.
('15', 209, 3, 13, 408479) However, I have come to it after bitter experience.
('15', 209, 3, 14, 408531) We are now exactly 30, young and old.
('15', 209, 3, 15, 408569) Of these Maganlal and Jamnadas are in Madras training in Tamil and hand weaving.
('15', 209, 3, 16, 408650) Jamnadass wife is also learning hand weaving.
('15', 209, 3, 17, 408696) The Pariah members wife having proved untrustworthy has left the Ashram.
('15', 209, 3, 18, 408769) During the travels just completed, I went to a place called Dehradun.
('15', 209, 3, 19, 408839) It is at the base of the Himalayas.
('15', 209, 3, 20, 408875) You will love the place.
('15', 209, 3, 21, 408900) The air is bracing and there are so many walks to the Himalayan hills.
('15', 209, 3, 22, 408971) Of course I was there only for a day but was able to know much about the place.
('15', 209, 3, 23, 409051) Ramdas, Prabhudas and Devdas were with me.
('15', 209, 3, 24, 409094) Have I told you that I have just begun to take cooked food?
('15', 209, 3, 25, 409154) The price of fruitarian food is prohibitive here and one cannot get even dates and monkey nuts at certain places for love or money.
('15', 209, 3, 26, 409286) This is a sad discovery.
('15', 209, 3, 27, 409311) It tells its own tale.
('15', 209, 3, 28, 409334) It is there however and one has to put up with it.
('15', 209, 3, 29, 409385) This is the 6th day of cooked food.
('15', 209, 3, 30, 409421) I take rice and dholl, a vegetable and a lemon.
('15', 209, 3, 31, 409469) This makes 4 articles.

('15', 210, 1, 2, 409565) going to add oil.
('15', 210, 1, 3, 409583) I have felt extremely weak during the six days and not half as satisfied as with the fruitarian meal.
('15', 210, 1, 4, 409685) I shall see what the addition of oil does for me.
('15', 210, 1, 5, 409735) Later on I shall take wheat or some other corn.
('15', 210, 2, 6, 409783) Chhaganlal is due here about the middle of the month.
('15', 210, 2, 7, 409837) West and Pragji are in charge at Phoenix.
('15', 210, 3, 8, 409879) I have written to Polak about you.
('15', 210, 3, 9, 409914) Every one of our company is just now involved in his own special troubles.
('15', 210, 3, 10, 409989) This war has naturally disturbed individuals in all parts of the world.
('15', 210, 4, 11, 410061) Ramdas is getting stronger.
('15', 210, 4, 12, 410089) Devdas has lost in health.
('15', 210, 4, 13, 410116) He thinks too much.
('15', 210, 4, 14, 410136) He has developed a tremendous sense of responsibility.
('15', 210, 4, 15, 410191) And he has become such a fine student.
('15', 210, 4, 16, 410230) I have been trying to wean him from his studies.
('15', 210, 4, 17, 410279) I do not know how far I shall succeed.Budri is due here today.
('15', 210, 4, 18, 410342) Sivpujan too has become a regular student but not so accurate as Devdas.
('15', 210, 5, 19, 410415) Fakiris death 1 was a glorious death.
('15', 210, 5, 20, 410453) I have seen few dying such a peaceful death.
('15', 210, 5, 21, 410498) He was conscious to the last moment.
('15', 210, 5, 22, 410535) He was screaming with pain.
('15', 210, 5, 23, 410563) I said, Fakiri, take the name of God.
('15', 210, 5, 24, 410601) He began to utter the sacred syllable and went off to sleep from which he never awoke.
('15', 210, 5, 25, 410688) The cremation ceremony was the simplest.
('15', 210, 5, 26, 410729) We gave information to nobody.
('15', 210, 5, 27, 410760) We fasted for half the day.
('15', 210, 5, 28, 410788) We chanted hymns before the body was taken to the crematorium.
('15', 210, 6, 29, 410851) With love to you from us all,

('15', 211, 7, 11, 411897) 1 The application was made on a printed form.
('15', 211, 7, 12, 411943) 2 The sum of Rs. 25 accompanying the application is found credited to the Deposits Account in the Societys books under this date.
('15', 211, 7, 13, 412073) The deposit was refunded on April 26 after the Managing Committee had, by a special resolution passed at a meeting held on the 19th, nominated Gandhiji an honorary life member.
('15', 211, 7, 14, 412250) 3 A footnote to the printed form says that women and teachers with pay of less than thirty rupees a month will be enrolled life members on payment of Rs. 25. The ordinary subscription for life membership was Rs. 50.

('15', 212, 3, 4, 412562) DEAR MR. MOHAMMED ALI 1, I have a reply from the Commissioner saying that under instructions from the Government of India my application for permissionto see you must be rejected.
('15', 212, 3, 5, 412742) The authorities have evidently failed to appreciate my motive in wanting to see you.
('15', 212, 3, 6, 412827) The only thing I as a passive resister can do in circumstances such as these is to bow to the decision of the Government of India.
('15', 212, 3, 7, 412958) I do hope your disease is now under control.
('15', 212, 3, 8, 413003) With regards to you all,

('15', 212, 8, 13, 413196) April 16, 1916 Mr. Patil was one of the ornaments of Ahmedabad.
('15', 212, 8, 14, 413260) If Ahmedabad had appreciated this, the people would have filled this hall to crowding.
('15', 212, 8, 15, 413347) When I received the invitation to settle in Ahmedabad, leaving Bombay, one of my friends assured me that, Mr. Patil being one of the signatories to the invitation, it was safe to accept it.
('15', 212, 8, 16, 413537) This showed that Mr. Patil was true to his word and modest as well.
('15', 212, 8, 17, 413605) Next, as for the premature death of Mr. Patil, I would suggest that we should inquire 3 why political leaders die at an early age.
('15', 212, 8, 18, 413736) In my opinion, such deaths are due to their neglecting their health.

('15', 213, 2, 3, 414175) SATYAGRAHA ASHRAM, AHMEDABAD, Chaitra Vad 2, Thursday, April 20, 1916
('15', 213, 3, 4, 414245) THE EDITOR, PRAJABANDHU
('15', 213, 4, 5, 414269) SIR, I write this hoping that you will permit me to place before your readers some of the many reflections which have occurred to me, and still occur, by reason of Bhai Govindrao Appaji Patils death at a premature age.
('15', 213, 4, 6, 414488) I have purposely used the adjective premature to denote the age of the deceased.
('15', 213, 4, 7, 414569) Any age below 50 should be considered premature, and Bhai Govindrao died before he was 50. It is a matter of no small grief that the untimely death of our first leaders deprives us of the benefit of their ripest years.
('15', 213, 4, 8, 414788) It seems we suffer from a kindof vanity.
('15', 213, 4, 9, 414829) We and our leaders seem to believe that there is some virtue in remaining more or less ailing and, accordingly, if the leaders leave us in their premature age, we see an especial virtue in the fact.
('15', 213, 4, 10, 415028) I think our leaders, and others too, but particularly our leaders, should consider it a sin to be taken ill or to remain ill, even if illness should come to them while serving the public.
('15', 213, 4, 11, 415216) If we go over all such cases among the leaders, right from the late Justice Telang 2 down to Bhai Govindrao we shall find that the illness of many of them was such as could have been prevented.
('15', 213, 4, 12, 415410) It is the duty of every one of us, especially of our leaders, to know how to maintain sound health.
('15', 213, 4, 13, 415510) I know from experience that we ourselves, in many cases, sow the seeds of premature death in our very childhood and, in some measure, our parents do this for us out of their ignorance and inordinate affection.
('15', 213, 4, 14, 415720) We generally depart from physical brahma charya, through marriage, or even otherwise, right in our childhood.
('15', 213, 4, 15, 415830) We choose many articles of food merely for their taste or only for the purpose of putting on fat.
('15', 213, 4, 16, 415928) The diet of those who have to use mental

('15', 214, 1, 2, 416149) energy and who lead a sedentary life should differ in its composition from that of others.
('15', 214, 1, 3, 416240) As a matter of fact, the diet of such people is seldom chosen in the light of this consideration.
('15', 214, 1, 4, 416338) I believe that, in a climate like that of Ahmedabad, excessive use of ghee is sure to damage the health of those who work only with the brain.
('15', 214, 1, 5, 416481) They should use pulses in very small quantities.
('15', 214, 1, 6, 416530) Those who have to do physical labour cannot do without a liberal use of pulses, but to others who do little physical work, too much of pulses will be like poison.
('15', 214, 1, 7, 416693) Almost all students complain of constipation, the reason being that they have in their diet an excessive quantity of spices, pulses and such other things, which are bound to lead to constipation.
('15', 214, 1, 8, 416889) They then damage their stomach by taking castor oil, Epsom salt or fruit salt, and ultimately fall a prey to death.
('15', 214, 1, 9, 417005) Our normal diet does not contain the vitamins which fresh fruits provide.
('15', 214, 1, 10, 417079) If we regularly ate fresh fruits in place of the usual diet, on a particular day of the week, constipation would disappear and our blood would become pure.
('15', 214, 1, 11, 417235) I do not suggest that a major change should be introduced in our diet at once.
('15', 214, 1, 12, 417314) I realize that our people would not agree to do so.
('15', 214, 1, 13, 417366) But they can, in order to ensure good health, reduce the quantity of spices, make a cautious use of pulses and begin taking fruits, etc.
('15', 214, 1, 14, 417503) It cannot be arguedthat this will require any very strenuous efforts.
('15', 214, 1, 15, 417573) The habit of taking tea or cocoa is really very dangerous.
('15', 214, 1, 16, 417632) I think those who insist on having tea would do well to study what the people of the tea drinking countries do and how they prepare tea.
('15', 214, 1, 17, 417769) But we have made no such study.
('15', 214, 1, 18, 417801) I do not know if people elsewhere consume all the tannin in tea, as we do here.
('15', 214, 1, 19, 417881) The Chinese do not allow tea leaves to remain in boiling water for more than half a minute; they strain the tea soon after adding the leaves.
('15', 214, 1, 20, 418023) The colour of the mixture would show that very little tannin had been absorbed in the water.
('15', 214, 1, 21, 418116) It should not be allowed to become more yellow than blades of hay, and never reddish in any case.
('15', 214, 1, 22, 418214) This is the kind of tea which millions of Chinese drink.
('15', 214, 1, 23, 418271) They never use milk in their tea.
('15', 214, 1, 24, 418305) They do not know what it is to milk cows.
('15', 214, 1, 25, 418347) They rarely use sugar in their tea.
('15', 214, 1, 26, 418383) If at all tea can be prepared so as to cause no harm, this is the way.
('15', 214, 1, 27, 418454) Here is what a man, highly experienced and famous, Doctor Cantlie by name, has to say.
('15', 214, 1, 28, 418541) He believes that the Chinese take tea because it is the easiest way of drinking pure water.
('15', 214, 1, 29, 418633) Below the boiling point, water cannot absorb the colour of tea, and so they take tea in place of simple water; that is, they use water which has been tested [for its temperature].
('15', 214, 1, 30, 418813) We are as careless about exercise as about diet.
('15', 214, 1, 31, 418862) To stroll one or
('15', 215, 0, 1, 418879) 216 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 215, 1, 2, 418921) two miles at a leisurely pace is no exercise.
('15', 215, 1, 3, 418967) To hit a billiard ball one or two hundred times with a cue is also no exercise.
('15', 215, 1, 4, 419047) When exercise is taken in this manner in a room with foul smelling air, the effect is bound to be harmful.
('15', 215, 1, 5, 419154) In our predicament, when no other form of exercise is convenient, walking is the best exercise.
('15', 215, 1, 6, 419250) But exercise is worth the name only if one can walk six miles at a stretch in the morning and again in the evening.
('15', 215, 1, 7, 419366) The walking should be done briskly, at a speed of four miles an hour.
('15', 215, 1, 8, 419436) Thoreau used to walk for eight hours daily when he wrote his best book.
('15', 215, 1, 9, 419508) Tolstoy testifies to the fact that while writing his best books he never used to sit at his desk before he had had plenty of exercise.
('15', 215, 1, 10, 419643) He always used to work on a farm.
('15', 215, 1, 11, 419677) [Some people say:] We cannot spare a minute from the lients work or from public work, and take exercise. Such talk is s heer vanity.
('15', 215, 1, 12, 419810) It would seem to proceed from a belief that but for us public work would go to the dogs.
('15', 215, 1, 13, 419899) The Grand Old Man of India, Dadabhai 1, has been observing all the general rules of hygiene and has never departed from his routine of exercise, etc.
('15', 215, 1, 14, 420049) Hence, we see him alive to this day, and it would be in no way surprising if this rishi were to live a hundred years like those of old times.
('15', 215, 1, 15, 420191) We violate one of the precepts of the Gita and suffer dire consequences.
('15', 215, 1, 16, 420264) It says that a person who eats without performing yajna is a thief; 2 the true meaning of yajna here is physical labour on a farm.
('15', 215, 1, 17, 420395) If we would make it a rule to work hard, to work, that is, with a shovel for four hours every day in a field, for the purpose of digesting our food, and would observe other rules [of hygiene], premature deaths might be far fewer among us.
('15', 215, 1, 18, 420634) When we begin to feel ashamed of falling ill, we shall undoubtedly acquire good health.
('15', 215, 1, 19, 420722) In my humble opinion it is the person, whether man or woman, that has discovered, by experiments, the rules to be followed in order to preserve his or her health even while engaged in public work, who can render any great service to the country.

('15', 216, 5, 6, 421193) MY DEAR FRIEND,
('15', 216, 6, 7, 421209) If you were here, you would go out into the jungle and like Job give way to crying bitterly.
('15', 216, 6, 8, 421302) Such is the misery we are passing through just now.
('15', 216, 6, 9, 421354) Naransamy still obstinately clings to his fever, the after effect of smallpox.
('15', 216, 6, 10, 421433) Chhotam is down with it and so are Bala and Parthasarathy.
('15', 216, 6, 11, 421492) Maganlal is sick, Vrajlal (one of the strongest workers) is sick.
('15', 216, 6, 12, 421558) Two more are on the sick bed and I have an attack of pleurisy which may develop heaven knows to what extent.
('15', 216, 6, 13, 421667) The only sound ones are Maganbhai, Manilal, Jamnadas and Mrs. Gandhi.
('15', 216, 6, 14, 421737) And they may collapse any day.
('15', 216, 6, 15, 421768) Our trust is in God.
('15', 216, 6, 16, 421789) He has a right to try us.
('15', 216, 6, 17, 421815) May we have the strength to go through the fire.
('15', 216, 6, 18, 421864) And let our sorrows bring you some comfort.
('15', 216, 6, 19, 421908) Yours are of a different type and avoidable.
('15', 216, 6, 20, 421953) Do then rise from them and learn that those who are near and dear to you are also suffering in their own way.
('15', 216, 6, 21, 422063) There is no escape from it in this wide, wide world.
('15', 216, 7, 22, 422116) The parcel containing biscuits and sticks is leaving today.
('15', 216, 7, 23, 422176) I shall await your criticism.

('15', 217, 5, 6, 422621) MY DEAR FRIEND,
('15', 217, 6, 7, 422637) Sickness is still there.
('15', 217, 6, 8, 422662) Thambi has written recalling his other boys.
('15', 217, 6, 9, 422707) I have told him that if such is his final decision I shall certainly send them.
('15', 217, 7, 10, 422787) Round the dark cloud the silver lining just now is made by Mrs. Gandhi, Ramdas and Maganlal.
('15', 217, 7, 11, 422880) Mrs. Gandhi has just now risen to her fullest height.
('15', 217, 7, 12, 422934) She keeps well and uses herself for the Ashram.
('15', 217, 7, 13, 422982) Maganlal is engaged in developing the weaving industry.
('15', 217, 7, 14, 423038) Ramdas makes an excellent uncomplaining nurse.
('15', 217, 7, 15, 423085) Manilal is, of course, all right.
('15', 217, 7, 16, 423119) But I have specially singled out the three as outstanding personalities just now.
('15', 217, 7, 17, 423201) At the time of writing my pleurisy is still a cause of care if not also of anxiety.
('15', 217, 8, 18, 423285) You ask why I have taken up [the] 5 articles vow.
('15', 217, 8, 19, 423335) Well, Hardwar is a holy place.
('15', 217, 8, 20, 423366) The Fair I attended occurs only every 13 years.
('15', 217, 8, 21, 423414) I felt that I ought to do something.
('15', 217, 8, 22, 423451) Hence the vow.
('15', 217, 8, 23, 423466) I have now been on cooked food for over a fortnight.
('15', 217, 8, 24, 423519) I do not know that I feel appreciably the worse for it.
('15', 217, 8, 25, 423575) Some say in appearance I have improved.
('15', 217, 8, 26, 423615) Cooked food had not a fair chance yet.
('15', 217, 8, 27, 423654) I have taken very little oil.
('15', 217, 8, 28, 423684) In fact mostly I avoid oil altogether.
('15', 217, 8, 29, 423723) The cost is only 1 d.
('15', 217, 8, 30, 423745) The difference in cost is tremendous.
('15', 217, 8, 31, 423783) These are the places I have visited.
('15', 217, 8, 32, 423820) It is a very rough map 2 but perhaps you will follow:
('15', 217, 9, 33, 423874) I have marked only those I can recall at present.
('15', 217, 10, 34, 423924) Surely you had a right to ask for biscuits and they are gone.
('15', 217, 10, 35, 423986) I hope you will receive them in good order.
('15', 217, 10, 36, 424030) With them has been packed a piece of towel made at the Ashram.
('15', 217, 10, 37, 424093) A bundle of sticks too has left and so [has] a box containing your clothes.

('15', 218, 11, 18, 425154) The principal object for the holding of the Conference was to effect a reconciliation between the two political parties.
('15', 218, 11, 19, 425275) 4 Home Rule must be granted to India and all classes should present a united front in demanding it.
('15', 218, 11, 20, 425375) If Home Rule should be granted, no particular class would dominate, otherwise it would not be Home Rule.
('15', 218, 11, 21, 425480) He for one would oppose any party or class that wanted to set itself above the others.
('15', 218, 11, 22, 425567) He made no distinction between the higher and the lower classes and did not look with disdain upon a man simply because he was a sweeper or a barber, nor did
('15', 218, 12, 23, 425725) 1 A political worker of Karnatak, popularly known as Lion of Karnatak 2 Gandhiji arrived in Belgaum on April 29 to attend the Bombay Provincial Conference.
('15', 218, 12, 24, 425881) 3 Gandhiji had accepted the invitation to attend the Conference but later on there were rumours that he might not attend it.
('15', 218, 12, 25, 426006) On an enquiry from the addressee, Gandhiji wrote this reply.

('15', 219, 1, 2, 426136) he look up to anyone merely because he was a Brahmin.
('15', 219, 1, 3, 426190) His religion taught him to consider all men alike, without distinction of class or creed.
('15', 219, 1, 4, 426280) Home Rule would not be granted so long as there were differences between them.
('15', 219, 1, 5, 426359) He promised to do all in his power to remove their disabilities.

('15', 219, 4, 8, 426515) May 1, 1916
('15', 219, 5, 9, 426527) Mr. Gandhi spoke as follows in Hindustani....
('15', 219, 5, 10, 426573) He was an outsider in the sense that he was not a member of the nationalist party or for that matter of any party.
('15', 219, 5, 11, 426688) He had no mental desire for listening to the speeches or to his own voice but he had felt it his duty as an aspirant for national service to study all the institutions he could and hence it was that he found himself at the Belgaum Conference.
('15', 219, 5, 12, 426931) He was desirous of being present there as he was anxious to see the inauguration of an era of peace between the two great parties which, he was assured, would take place at Belgaum.
('15', 219, 5, 13, 427113) It was a matter to him, therefore, of great pleasure that the foundation for unity was being laid at the Conference.
('15', 219, 5, 14, 427230) He heartily supported the resolution 2 moved by Mr. Tilak.
('15', 219, 5, 15, 427289) He was sure he was not expected to endorse every word of the resolution on the report that was adopted.
('15', 219, 5, 16, 427393) It should be enough that he found himself in agreement with the main draft of the resolution.
('15', 219, 5, 17, 427487) Had the wording of the resolution been in his own hand, he would probably have omitted some expressions.
('15', 219, 5, 18, 427592) Mr. Tilaks speech left nothing to be desired and he if worked as he was sure he would, and the nationalist party as a whole also worked truly in the spirit of the resolution and Mr.
('15', 219, 6, 19, 427774) 1 This Conference, held from 29th April to 1st May, was attended by leading Nationalists from Bombay, C.P. and Berar and was held after the Poona meeting of January 16, 1916, which had postponed settlement of the question of limitation on the number of delegates from political bodies of two years standing which had received automatic affiliation after the amendment of the Congress constitution in 1915. 2 Tilaks resolution, carried unanimously, read as follows: That this conference adopts the reports of Messrs Belvi, Baptista and Tilak, and as in the interest of our Motherland under the present circumstances it is desirable to unite, resolves to accept, the constitution of the Congress as amended at its last sessions, though the amendment is highly unsatisfactory, and appoints a Committee composed of the following gentlemen, to do further work from within: G. S. Khaparde, J. Baptista, D. V. Belvi, B. G. Tilak and N. C. Kelkar (Secretary). Vide Source Material for a History of the Freedom Movement in India (Bombay Government),Letter to F.S.

('15', 220, 1, 2, 428895) Tilaks remarks, he was sure that the coming union would be a great blessing to the motherland.
('15', 220, 1, 3, 428990) It was for that reason that he found himself in disagreement with Mr. Baptista, who seemed to be so much in tune with the pleaders.
('15', 220, 1, 4, 429122) If they approached the question in the pleaders spirit they would be constantly picking holes.
('15', 220, 1, 5, 429217) What was needed was to approach the national question as common men.
('15', 220, 1, 6, 429286) They would then overlook the faults and defects in their erstwhile opponents but would ever seek points of agreement and contact.
('15', 220, 1, 7, 429416) Indeed if the party returned to the Congress fold with an absolutely honest and selfless spirit, ever thinking of the country and its cause and never thinking of party or personal gain, God would be with them and with God with them the nation could then [go] forward in the face of the worlds opposition.

('15', 221, 5, 7, 430711) It is not a rule with me to write about happenings in the Ashram myself and so it didnt occur to me to write about Fakiri.

('15', 221, 7, 14, 431182) You have succumbed to a bad temptation.
('15', 221, 7, 15, 431222) I wish you could save yourself from that.
('15', 221, 7, 16, 431264) There is only one way.
('15', 221, 7, 17, 431287) While in service, make the ultimate good your only concern: indulge in no pleasures and, as much as you can, render disinterested service to others; so, you will have some inward peace.

('15', 222, 5, 6, 432201) They are good questions 1 you have asked me.
('15', 222, 6, 7, 432246) There must be occasions when I feel agitated.
('15', 222, 7, 8, 432292) I do get the unworthy thought sometimes that it would have been better if events had followed a different course from what they did.
('15', 222, 7, 9, 432425) Regret I feel often enough.
('15', 222, 8, 10, 432453) I may be guilty of partiality sometimes, but so rarely that I dont recollect any such instance.
('15', 222, 9, 11, 432549) I am not able to do everything I want to.
('15', 222, 10, 12, 432591) I see my imperfections every moment and am constantly struggling to get rid of them.

('15', 223, 4, 5, 433481) MY DEAR FRIEND,
('15', 223, 5, 6, 433497) I have two letters this week from you.
('15', 223, 5, 7, 433536) You want all the news from here.
('15', 223, 5, 8, 433569) I think I have supplied you with it.
('15', 223, 5, 9, 433606) Today Harilals wife, who has been here for a few days, leaves for Calcutta to join her husband.
('15', 223, 5, 10, 433702) Manilal goes as escort.
('15', 223, 5, 11, 433726) We shall be today 20 in the Ashram when Chanchi has gone.
('15', 223, 5, 12, 433784) Maganlal is doing well with his handloom work.
('15', 223, 5, 13, 433831) Ramdas and Devdas are going forward with their studies, which consist of Sanskrit, Gujarati, Tamil and Hindi.
('15', 223, 5, 14, 433941) I am their sole teacher.
('15', 223, 5, 15, 433966) Pra bhudas is with his father just now.
('15', 223, 5, 16, 434006) I do not know what Chhaganlal will do in the end.
('15', 223, 5, 17, 434056) Maganbhai has left the Ashram for good.
('15', 223, 5, 18, 434096) He could not as he said bear the responsibility.
('15', 223, 5, 19, 434145) He could not comply with all the rules.
('15', 223, 5, 20, 434185) So now Maganlal is the only responsible man left with me barring Manilal.
('15', 223, 5, 21, 434259) There are other new men.
('15', 223, 5, 22, 434284) They are good but still untired.
('15', 223, 5, 23, 434317) What I have said may yet come true everyone may find it necessary to leave me.
('15', 223, 5, 24, 434396) I think I have strength to face that situation.
('15', 223, 5, 25, 434444) You say you are morose there.
('15', 223, 5, 26, 434474) Can you not see much in the above to give you strength and comfort?
('15', 223, 5, 27, 434542) To be confined ought not to make the difference it seems to make in your life.
('15', 223, 5, 28, 434621) Oh, if you could but see there are millions much worse off than you are.
('15', 223, 5, 29, 434694) What of the combatants themselves?
('15', 223, 5, 30, 434729) What of the families they leave behind?
('15', 223, 5, 31, 434769) I wish you could get out of the Slough of Despond and make the best use of the situation as it faces you.

('15', 224, 2, 3, 435102) June 4, 1916
('15', 224, 3, 4, 435115) I am tired of conferences and speeches and now of hearing my own voice as well.
('15', 224, 3, 5, 435195) When Lord Buddha decided to work for the emancipation of the world, he did not convene a conference and get it to pass resolutions.
('15', 224, 3, 6, 435327) Nor did Jesus Christ do anything of the sort.
('15', 224, 3, 7, 435373) But not being blessed with such greatness, we convene such conferences because, I think I am right in this, we lack the requisite strength for our work.
('15', 224, 3, 8, 435526) This happens all over the country; and so I dont say that yours is the only instance.
('15', 224, 3, 9, 435612) There is something novel about the origin of this conference and its procedure of work.
('15', 224, 3, 10, 435700) I believe at the same time that it does serve a useful purpose.
('15', 224, 3, 11, 435764) The work here is not done through long speeches.
('15', 224, 3, 12, 435813) I am glad to see that everyone speaks to the point and keeps himself to the subject.
('15', 224, 3, 13, 435898) We must have formed the habit of speaking briefly and to the point through the business atmosphere of Gujarat.
('15', 224, 3, 14, 436009) In the changes taking place today in our communities, we have observed [their] rise and fall through their own actions and deserts.
('15', 224, 3, 15, 436141) Champaneri Banias were once Vaniks 2; then by vocation they became Ghanchis 3. In the caste set up of India, it is in no way impossible that through better education and economic advance they may again become Vaniks or attain even a higher status, or that they may be degraded to a level lower than that of Ghanchi.
('15', 224, 3, 16, 436457) Our sin in despising the Antyajas 4 degrades the entire Hindu society.
('15', 224, 3, 17, 436528) Dhulabhai 5 Dhed, who stays with me and who has accompanied me here, once asked a woman for some water.
('15', 224, 3, 18, 436632) On the woman inquiring about his caste, Dhulabhai replied that he wasDhed.
('15', 224, 3, 19, 436707) The lady said: I dont believe it.
('15', 224, 3, 20, 436741) You are quite well dressed and clean; you do not look like a Dhed.
('15', 224, 3, 21, 436808) Here is water for you. So saying
('15', 224, 4, 22, 436841) 1 At the Conference of Friendly Associations of Communities 2 Members of a Hindu caste traditionally engaged in trade, commerce and banking 3 Those who make and sell seed oils 4 Lowest caste among Hindus traditionally charged with sanitary duties 5 Probably a misprint for Dudabhai, who had joined the Ashram on September 26, 1915; vide Diary for 1915

('15', 225, 1, 2, 437235) she gave him water to drink.
('15', 225, 1, 3, 437264) But Dhulabhai, after drinking the water, told her again that he was a Dhed and that he did not wish to deceive her.
('15', 225, 1, 4, 437380) In bearing with the abuses she then showered on him, Dhulabhai showed courage and strength of mind.
('15', 225, 1, 5, 437480) In just the same way, the entire Hindu society despises the Dhed people and, as long as this does not change, we shall not be able to convince the whites of South Africa and elsewhere of the utter injustice of the aversion they show for us.
('15', 225, 1, 6, 437721) Today I take a pledge that, if I am wrong in any belief of mine and if someone from amongst you proves it, I will accept the correction in all humility.
('15', 225, 1, 7, 437874) But, at the same time, I also take another pledge that I will not rest till I make you change this wrong belief of yours in regard to the Antyajas.

('15', 225, 5, 11, 438099) June 5, 1916
('15', 225, 6, 12, 438112) I am in India to learn what I ought to do and I cannot say how long I shall take to do so.
('15', 225, 6, 13, 438203) Even in standing now before you to speak, my aim is to learn something.
('15', 225, 6, 14, 438275) I have not come prepared to speak on the subject; I thank you all the same for this opportunity to express my ideas.
('15', 225, 6, 15, 438392) Newspapers report my speeches, but sometimes I am not rightly understood and my meaning is distorted, which is not good for a satyagrahi which I claim to be.
('15', 225, 6, 16, 438550) I shall be happy, therefore, if reports of my speeches are shown to me before they are published: this is my request.
('15', 225, 6, 17, 438668) I was quite pleased with the work of the Conference yesterday, for people spoke briefly and to the point.
('15', 225, 6, 18, 438774) I for one believe that the time for conferences is long past and the time has now come for us to show some results and hold our peace; our words, when they follow such action, will have an effect all their own.
('15', 225, 6, 19, 438985) This was the way of the divinely inspired Buddha, Jesus, Mahomed and others and of Martin Luther likewise.
('15', 225, 6, 20, 439092) I have devoted much thought to the subject of the caste system 2 and come to the conclusion that Hindu society cannot dispense with it, that it lives on because of the discipline of caste.

('15', 226, 1, 2, 439501) caste or varnavyavastha 1. Our society was organized in this manner for the purpose of self control, that is, for self denial.
('15', 226, 1, 3, 439628) Certainly, there is a difference between varnavyavastha in the West and among us; but there is varnavyavastha everywhere, all the same.
('15', 226, 1, 4, 439764) So long as there are among human beings impulses which tend to a godly life and those which tend to a demoniac life, so long will the division of society into communities remain.
('15', 226, 1, 5, 439943) It is a vain effort to replace this structure by one single community.
('15', 226, 1, 6, 440014) Communities, too, may be born and may die.
('15', 226, 1, 7, 440057) Mr. Lyall has affirmed in a book of his not only that among Hindus communities have made their appearance and died out, but also that, while outsiders may have joined the Hindu fold, there is no evidence that the Hindu society converted others to the Hindu faith as Christians did to theirs.
('15', 226, 1, 8, 440349) Members of non Hindu faiths and sects became Hindus in course of time.
('15', 226, 1, 9, 440420) the status of a community depends on its function in society and not on the scriptures.
('15', 226, 1, 10, 440508) It need not be imagined that caste rests on the idea that members of a community may eat together and marry among themselves.
('15', 226, 1, 11, 440634) If friendly relations depended on eating together and inter marriage, the German and the British would not be fighting against each other.
('15', 226, 1, 12, 440773) The Rajputs 2 of Kathiawar do sit together at meals and marry among themselves but have no end of internecine strife and fighting.
('15', 226, 1, 13, 440904) Of course, these caste restrictions have something of value in them.
('15', 226, 1, 14, 440973) It is but natural that a father and daughter want to remain in the same social group and hence communities or groups naturally come to have their distinctive organizations.
('15', 226, 1, 15, 441146) But the evils which have found their way into the various communities must be eradicated without delay.
('15', 226, 1, 16, 441250) Though it is important that we apply our minds to the social problems concerning unmarried girls, widows, widowers, etc.,and they do require capacity to think this has nothing to do with a knowledge of letters.
('15', 226, 1, 17, 441461) There are 60 million untouchables in our country.
('15', 226, 1, 18, 441511) It is necessary to improve their condition, because this is a blot on Hindu society, one which India will have to atone for at a heavy price.
('15', 226, 1, 19, 441653) During my campaigns in South Africa, the whites used to ask me what right we had to demand better treatment from them when we were guilty of ill treating the untouchables among us.

('15', 227, 1, 2, 442217) held the same view about the imperative need for the uplift of this down trodden class.
('15', 227, 1, 3, 442305) In the Punjab, people treat the untouchables fairly well when they need their services but, when the need is over, they return to their old ways.
('15', 227, 1, 4, 442451) Conduct of this kind has nothing religious in it.
('15', 227, 1, 5, 442501) We must maintain good relations with these classes all the time; success will assuredly be ours in anything we do from a religious motive.

('15', 227, 10, 15, 442991) MY DEAR WEST, We must agree to differ as to the accounts.
('15', 227, 10, 16, 443049) All I want is passive resistance expenditure after the date of the last account published and bank balance.
('15', 227, 10, 17, 443157) Surely this is all in your books.
('15', 227, 10, 18, 443191) I should despair if you told me that we had no passive resistance a/c in our ledgers.
('15', 227, 10, 19, 443277) I know that this is not so.
('15', 227, 10, 20, 443305) Will you kindly send me these items?
('15', 227, 10, 21, 443342) So much for the business part.
('15', 227, 10, 22, 443373) Your conversational letter I have.

('15', 228, 1, 2, 443877) of you as I have known you.
('15', 228, 1, 3, 443905) I never doubted that you would be able to make your way among the officials by your very bluntness.
('15', 228, 1, 4, 444005) The novelty of resistance may shock them at first but pleases them afterwards.
('15', 228, 1, 5, 444084) Even they must get tired of nodders if one may coin that noun.
('15', 228, 1, 6, 444147) And you will have to continue to do that work whether the people appreciate it or not or rather want it or not.
('15', 228, 1, 7, 444259) Appreciation need not be looked for.
('15', 228, 1, 8, 444296) Do please send me all the correspondence you wish to.
('15', 228, 1, 9, 444350) I promise to go through it all.
('15', 228, 1, 10, 444382) Do not think that South Africa disappears from my mind.
('15', 228, 1, 11, 444438) How can it?
('15', 228, 1, 12, 444450) I owe much to S.A., i.e.
('15', 228, 1, 13, 444475) to friendships formed there.
('15', 228, 1, 14, 444504) In my moments of sadness recollection of friends working there is no small comfort.
('15', 228, 1, 15, 444588) Your successes and your failures are alike matters of deepest interest to me.
('15', 228, 1, 16, 444666) Is your little school still going on?
('15', 228, 1, 17, 444704) How is Granny 1 doing?
('15', 228, 1, 18, 444727) Is she still as fresh as before?
('15', 228, 1, 19, 444760) The very thought of her and her working away is an inspiration.
('15', 228, 1, 20, 444824) Just now I am reading to the Ashram at prayer time Pilgrims Progress.
('15', 228, 1, 21, 444894) I often think of Mrs. Wests sweet voice and want her to sing to us When I survey the wondrous cross!
('15', 228, 1, 22, 444995) The whole of Phoenix rises before us whenever we sing our favourite hymns.
('15', 228, 1, 23, 445070) With love to you all,
('15', 228, 2, 24, 445092) Yours sincerely,

('15', 228, 7, 29, 445285) MY DEAR FRIEND, This letter will make you sick.
('15', 228, 7, 30, 445333) Yet I must give you the information Manilal has deceived me again.
('15', 228, 7, 31, 445400) He gave some money to Harilal and disowned all knowledge of it when I questioned him.
('15', 228, 7, 32, 445486) He had no leg to stand on.
('15', 228, 7, 33, 445513) He confessed his fault immediately.
('15', 228, 7, 34, 445549) But the

('15', 229, 1, 2, 445779) incident showed the boys extreme weakness.
('15', 229, 1, 3, 445822) He has therefore left the Ashram for Madras and has to throw himself on his own resources.
('15', 229, 1, 4, 445913) If he makes proper use of this disciplinary period, one may yet make something of him.
('15', 229, 1, 5, 446000) He is a very weak boy.
('15', 229, 1, 6, 446023) I have been fasting during the week.
('15', 229, 1, 7, 446060) I fasted 3 days.
('15', 229, 1, 8, 446077) I broke it yesterday.
('15', 229, 1, 9, 446099) The last day found me very weak and suffering much.
('15', 229, 1, 10, 446151) I am all right now and not much the worse for the fast.
('15', 229, 1, 11, 446207) You will please therefore not worry about me or Manilal.
('15', 229, 1, 12, 446264) Apart from this incident the Ashram is going forward.
('15', 229, 1, 13, 446318) The handloom weaving is being pressed forward for all it is worth.
('15', 229, 1, 14, 446385) We hope to make the place self supporting in a years time.
('15', 229, 1, 15, 446444) This I know you will like immensely.
('15', 229, 1, 16, 446481) Of shifting to Dehradun or elsewhere, only when you are here.
('15', 229, 1, 17, 446543) The climate of Ahmedabad is by no means so bad or at all bad.
('15', 229, 1, 18, 446605) Only the boys were becoming acclimatised and I had not yet found out the food proper for the climate.
('15', 229, 1, 19, 446707) Now I think I have hit upon it.
('15', 229, 1, 20, 446739) All the smallpox patients are now hale and hearty and probably by the time you are here, the marks will have all gone.
('15', 229, 1, 21, 446858) Naransamy has gained.
('15', 229, 1, 22, 446880) He has almost lost his deafness and he is daily growing fatter.
('15', 229, 1, 23, 446944) There are some new men whom you will be delighted to meet.
('15', 229, 1, 24, 447003) They are strong and conscientious workers.
('15', 229, 1, 25, 447046) Of old and experienced hands Maganlal is the only one left.
('15', 229, 1, 26, 447106) But then he is a host in himself and he is not likely to desert me.
('15', 229, 1, 27, 447174) I do hope that by this time at least you are in possession of all your things.

('15', 229, 5, 33, 447417) June 24, 1916
('15', 229, 6, 34, 447431) A public meeting of the citizens of Bombay was held in the Empire Theatre on the evening of Saturday, the 24th June 1916, to uphold the liberty of the Press and protest against the Press Act of 1910, under the auspices of the Indian Press Association.
('15', 229, 6, 35, 447683) Mr. B. G. Horniman, Editor of the Bombay Chronicle, presided.
('15', 229, 7, 36, 447745) 1 A brief report of this appeared in The Bombay Chronicle, 26 6 1916.
('15', 230, 0, 1, 447815) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 231
('15', 230, 1, 2, 447857) It was a very largely attended meeting.
('15', 230, 1, 3, 447897) There were not a few Hindu Deccani and Gujaratiladies among the audience.
('15', 230, 1, 4, 447971) Principal among them was the wife of the Honourable Mr. Chimanlal Setalvad with her daughters and daughters in law.
('15', 230, 2, 5, 448087) Messrs Gandhi, Horniman and Jamnadas D. Dharamsey were received on arrival with loud cheers.
('15', 230, 2, 6, 448180) In the case of Mr. Gandhi cheers were called for once more by an occupant of one of the upper galleries.
('15', 230, 2, 7, 448285) Mr. Gandhi delivered his address in Gujarati, urging that that was the true way of being faithful to his motherland.
('15', 230, 3, 8, 448402) Mr. Gandhi said:
('15', 230, 4, 9, 448419) MR. PRESIDENT, DEAR SISTERS AND BROTHERS, I see that in this hall there are several persons laughing, because I have commenced to speak in Gujarati.
('15', 230, 4, 10, 448568) (Laughter.) You see we want to have swaraj; and when we get it, I am sure you will agree with me that we ought to carry on our business in the Gujarati tongue.
('15', 230, 4, 11, 448728) (Laughter.) Crores and crores of our people for whom the swaraj will have to be carried on, it is impossible to deal with in English, to which they are quite foreign.
('15', 230, 4, 12, 448895) It is undoubtedly the fact that in this assembly we have to speak to a majority of English speaking people, and to them I beg to tender an apology for venturing to address the meeting in my own native tongue.
('15', 230, 4, 13, 449104) (Laughter.) It may be said that besides those who know English in this hall, there are not a few who speak Marathi.
('15', 230, 4, 14, 449220) I know that there are those who speak that language, but to them I would respectfully say that hereafter they should learn the Gujarati language, so that when they have occasion to hear my Gujarati speech, they will be able to follow me somehow or other.
('15', 230, 4, 15, 449475) (Laughter.) The resolution that is placed in my hands runs thus: That this meeting of loyal and law abiding Indian subjects of His Majesty the King Emperor, believing the existence of a free public Press to be one of the first essentials of a healthy and progressive State and necessary to the proper development, political and moral, of civilized peoples; and further that the extension and maintenance of freedom in all departments of public life is the surest guarantee of popular progress and contentment and of mutual trust between the Government and the people, asks that the Press in this country should enjoy the utmost liberty of expression, subject to the legal restraints of the ordinary law and of penalties inflicted only after proper trial and conviction.
('15', 230, 4, 16, 450245) (Cheers.)
('15', 230, 5, 17, 450255) (Mr. Gandhi explained the resolution in Gujarati.) Up to now, this Press Act was considered to be innocent and
('15', 231, 0, 1, 450366) 232 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 231, 1, 2, 450408) innocuous, so far as the high class journalists were concerned; in fact, that was the promise given by the Government at the time when this law was passed to the elected members of the Legislative Council of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor General.
('15', 231, 1, 3, 450665) Those members accepted the enactment under that promise.
('15', 231, 1, 4, 450722) They were assured thatthe law would be made operative against only offending journalists.
('15', 231, 1, 5, 450812) But from what has now happened in the case of New India, it may be said that the promise was illusory.
('15', 231, 1, 6, 450915) We are here disillusioned now as to the real character of this law on account of the attack made by the Government against Mrs. Annie Besant.
('15', 231, 1, 7, 451057) (Cheers.) That circumstance has awakened us to the true nature of the law.
('15', 231, 1, 8, 451132) Where is the security from this law when zulum 1 is practised under it on respectable journalists?
('15', 231, 1, 9, 451231) Remember that it is said that at this moment our Government are in a troublous condition.
('15', 231, 1, 10, 451321) Remember also that we, the people of this country, say that what is a troublous condition of the Government is a troublous condition to us.
('15', 231, 1, 11, 451461) (Hear, hear.) And yet in the midst of this condition if Government are prepared to drag us into the clutches of these severe laws, what would be our fate after the war is over?
('15', 231, 1, 12, 451638) What will then happen to us is on the knees of the gods.
('15', 231, 1, 13, 451695) (Laughter.) What can we do now but to bear our fate with resignation?
('15', 231, 1, 14, 451765) That is our only duty.
('15', 231, 1, 15, 451788) We must take heart that our present fate will change for the better in the future.
('15', 231, 1, 16, 451871) It must.
('15', 231, 1, 17, 451880) I have no faith in these meetings and in these resolutions.
('15', 231, 1, 18, 451940) (Laughter.) It is simply a waste of time to hold these meetings and carry these resolutions.
('15', 231, 1, 19, 452033) But what else can we do?
('15', 231, 1, 20, 452058) There is no alternative for usthe subject peopleto do aught but place on record our view on a given subject.
('15', 231, 1, 21, 452167) And, therefore, I have come here in response to an invitation.
('15', 231, 1, 22, 452230) I feel that something should be done in this mattersomething done so that our complaint may reach the ears of the Government.
('15', 231, 1, 23, 452356) (Hear, hear.) Whatever we may say here with a view to expressing our feelings on the subject, it is an undoubted fact that we cannot express a hundredth part of what we actually feel in our minds on account of this outrageous enactment.
('15', 231, 1, 24, 452593) We read newspapers.
('15', 231, 1, 25, 452613) Yes, we do.
('15', 231, 1, 26, 452625) But are you sure that you read the real thoughts of the editor.
('15', 231, 1, 27, 452689) I think not.
('15', 231, 1, 28, 452702) Independent views of writers are not published.
('15', 231, 1, 29, 452750) What is published is otherwise and, therefore, one can say that it is advisable to read the opposite into the words that appear in the newspapers.
('15', 231, 1, 30, 452897) (Laughter.) I am not at all exaggerating.
('15', 231, 1, 31, 452939) I have myself been editor of a newspaper for several years and can

('15', 232, 0, 1, 453019) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 233
('15', 232, 1, 2, 453061) explain from personal experience the difficulties which the editor has to undergo in the true discharge of his duties I am not disputing the fact that some restraint is necessarily to be exercised on newspapers, but there is this to be remembered that in the exercise of such a restraint, discretion and limit should not be lost sight of.
('15', 232, 1, 3, 453400) It is only with unwarranted restraint that I quarrel.
('15', 232, 1, 4, 453454) For flimsy reasons, Government officials ought not to exercise restraint on the peoples right to express their views.
('15', 232, 1, 5, 453572) (Cheers.) Restraint means inducement to indulge in fallacious or misleading thoughts.
('15', 232, 1, 6, 453658) That leads one to become the enemy of my Government.
('15', 232, 1, 7, 453711) (Laughter.) My genuine feelings are suppressed; I cannot give free vent to them; I write the reverse of what I feel.
('15', 232, 1, 8, 453828) By reason of such enactments, there cannot be an unalloyed affection for our rulers among the 30 crores of our countrymen.
('15', 232, 1, 9, 453951) There should be pure justice administered in India.
('15', 232, 1, 10, 454003) (Cheers.) The Government are like our trustees or protectors.
('15', 232, 1, 11, 454065) To speak the truth I do not like the word trustee.
('15', 232, 1, 12, 454116) India is no longer in a state of childhood, and, therefore, she does not require a trustee or a protector.
('15', 232, 1, 13, 454223) India is one of the most ancient countries; she is one of the most experienced countries; can her subjects be said with propriety to be inexperienced or in a state of childhood?
('15', 232, 1, 14, 454401) No; we Indians stand in no need of a protector.
('15', 232, 1, 15, 454449) All that he need do for us is to dispense pure justice.
('15', 232, 1, 16, 454505) We, the people of India, are as liberal in our views as we are innocent of any mischievous tendencies; all that we are is that we are despondent.
('15', 232, 1, 17, 454651) But we will never be guilty of anything disloyal.
('15', 232, 1, 18, 454701) Under these circumstances, I beg to appeal to the Government to do everything that is just and righteous; if that is done, there would be no necessity for these meetings.
('15', 232, 1, 19, 454872) (Hear, hear and laughter.) That is a general request.
('15', 232, 1, 20, 454926) My special request to them is on behalf of the newspaper writers.
('15', 232, 1, 21, 454992) I say, Do not harass the respectable editors and proprietors. I further say, Treat us as generously as you would the English people.
('15', 232, 1, 22, 455125) We the people of India are not a race of hypocrites.
('15', 232, 1, 23, 455178) (Laughter.) We are enlightened, good and civilized people. (Hear, hear.) To my newspaper writer brethren I say, Say openly whatever you have to say. (Hear, hear.) That is our duty.
('15', 232, 1, 24, 455359) We should rely on ourselves to expatiate on our grievances, but we must not forget that we have to do that under certain restrictions born of politeness and sobriety.
('15', 232, 1, 25, 455526) Whenever we are face to face with a political catastrophe, we should never hesitate to say in as clear terms as possible what we feel and desire to say.
('15', 232, 1, 26, 455679) (Hear, hear.) For such plain speaking and honest pleading of our cause if we are punished by the Government, well, let
('15', 233, 0, 1, 455798) 234 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 233, 1, 2, 455840) them do so.
('15', 233, 1, 3, 455852) (Hear, hear and laughter.) What can they do if the worst comes to the worst?
('15', 233, 1, 4, 455929) They will take our bodies at best.
('15', 233, 1, 5, 455964) (Laughter.) Very well, if our bodies are taken away, our souls will become free.
('15', 233, 1, 6, 456045) (Hear, hear and roars of laughter.)

('15', 233, 6, 11, 456170) MY DEAR CHARLIE, It is no use having Tota Ram there.
('15', 233, 6, 12, 456223) I have met him.
('15', 233, 6, 13, 456239) He will not help.
('15', 233, 6, 14, 456257) Indenture system has to go because it is bad in itself and is a remnant of slavery.
('15', 233, 6, 15, 456341) If it can be done away with today, it should be without considering any interest whatsoever.

('15', 233, 11, 19, 456563) FROM M. K. GANDHI AHMEDABAD, July 24, 1916
('15', 233, 12, 20, 456606) MY DEAR FRIEND, The wooden pillow you describe never reached me.
('15', 233, 12, 21, 456671) I am asking Dr. Jivraj Mehta.
('15', 233, 12, 22, 456701) All of us appreciated the portrait of yourself and companions you have sent.
('15', 233, 12, 23, 456778) We all think that you are looking well.
('15', 233, 12, 24, 456818) But I know that you are not mentally as happy as you ought to be.
('15', 233, 12, 25, 456884) I have been reading Pilgrims Progress to the boys.
('15', 233, 12, 26, 456935) Christian and Hopeful are in the grip of Giant Despair.
('15', 233, 12, 27, 456991) The latter suggests to them suicide.
('15', 233, 12, 28, 457028) Christian half succumbs to the suggestion.
('15', 233, 12, 29, 457071) Hopeful strenuously fights against it and argues that when we find ourselves in a tight corner, we should think of those who might be in a still tighter [one].
('15', 233, 12, 30, 457231) The argument is good.
('15', 233, 12, 31, 457253) There are millions in a much worse condition than you are in.
('15', 233, 12, 32, 457315) And then, after all, happiness is a mental state.
('15', 233, 12, 33, 457365) And no one

('15', 234, 1, 2, 457418) but ourselves can control that state.
('15', 234, 1, 3, 457456) In the midst of plenty a man may be most miserable and another amid penury may be as happy as the smiling sun.
('15', 234, 1, 4, 457567) Why worry about your South Africa affairs?
('15', 234, 1, 5, 457610) After all you were ready to let them go.
('15', 234, 1, 6, 457651) Let them go.
('15', 234, 1, 7, 457664) So much the less burden.
('15', 234, 1, 8, 457689) Whilst under restraint you are looked after.
('15', 234, 1, 9, 457734) When the restraint is removed, you will come to the Ashram and bring with you a pair of sturdy hand and feet.
('15', 234, 1, 10, 457844) We are employing ours to make us self sustained.
('15', 234, 1, 11, 457893) You will find yourself in such an independent comm unity and take your natural place.
('15', 234, 1, 12, 457979) With love,

('15', 234, 5, 17, 458124) [Before July 26, 1916] 2
('15', 234, 6, 18, 458149) No one doubts that railway passengers are put to many hardships.
('15', 234, 6, 19, 458214) Against many of these, we have the remedy in our own hands.
('15', 234, 6, 20, 458274) Unity is in the air all over India.
('15', 234, 6, 21, 458310) If we did no more than resort to this, quite a few of the hardships could be overcome.
('15', 234, 6, 22, 458397) This article makes some suggestions on how they could be.
('15', 234, 6, 23, 458455) Those into whose hands this may fall are requested to read it carefully and afterwards to read it out to others who cannot read.
('15', 234, 6, 24, 458584) The reader will easily guess that the cost of paper and printing must have been met by someone with a public spirit and, in view of that at any rate, he will realize that the article should not be treated lightly merely because he has got it free.
('15', 234, 6, 25, 458832) To the authorities, I shall say: If you are a station master, you can remove many of the hardships of passengers.
('15', 234, 6, 26, 458946) Using courtesy in your dealings with poor passengers, you set an example to your subordinates.
('15', 234, 6, 27, 459041) If you are a ticket collector, with a little reflection you will realize that the poor should receive the same time and attention that
('15', 234, 7, 28, 459176) 1 This was published as a pamphlet and distributed gratis in Gujarat during 1916 17. 2 A summary of this pamphlet appeared in Kathiawar Times, 26 7 1916.
('15', 235, 0, 1, 459330) 236 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 235, 1, 2, 459372) you give to first and second class passengers.
('15', 235, 1, 3, 459419) The railways depend on the poor for their existence and you owe your salaries largely to the money received from them.
('15', 235, 1, 4, 459538) Some booking clerks abuse the poor, address them slightingly, and on top of that delay issuing tickets to them as long as they can.
('15', 235, 1, 5, 459670) This is no way of showing ones importance.
('15', 235, 1, 6, 459713) Issuing a ticket without delay to anyone asking for it saves the latters time and you lose nothing by doing so.
('15', 235, 1, 7, 459825) If you are a policeman, you should refrain from accepting bribes, resolve not to shove the poor people about but behave towards them with kindness.
('15', 235, 1, 8, 459973) You should understand that you are servants of the people and not their masters.
('15', 235, 1, 9, 460054) It is your duty to help them out of their difficulties.
('15', 235, 1, 10, 460110) That you should yourself become the cause of difficulties is sheer injustice.
('15', 235, 1, 11, 460188) To educated passengers, I shall say: Most of you like showing that you are educated and that you have some patriotism in you.
('15', 235, 1, 12, 460314) If you use your patriotism in doing good to the illiterate and poor passengers with whom you come into contact, you will be doing national service without having to search for an occasion.
('15', 235, 1, 13, 460503) For instance, if a passenger is being ill treated, you can help him in a number of ways, Even if you do not generally travel third class, your doing so occasionally just to get experience is likely to benefit the third class passengers very much.
('15', 235, 1, 14, 460750) If you go in their midst, without disclosing your status, for purchasing tickets, etc., it will be easy for you to find a remedy for the difficulties you will experience in the process and the facilities offered to you will be available before long to the people at large.
('15', 235, 1, 15, 461023) Sometimes educated people themselves become the cause of injustice to third class passengers.
('15', 235, 1, 16, 461117) They are impatient to get their tickets first, may enjoy special facilities in trains and occupy more space than they need; the poor are put to difficulties in consequence.
('15', 235, 1, 17, 461290) The educated class must certainly refrain from making itself a cause of injustice in this manner, if it can do nothing else.
('15', 235, 1, 18, 461415) It is your duty to write to the authorities about any deficiencies that you may observe on stations or trains.
('15', 235, 1, 19, 461526) To passengers in general, I shall say: No matter what category of passengers you belong to, educated
('15', 236, 0, 1, 461627) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 237
('15', 236, 1, 2, 461669) or uneducated, rich or poor, if you bear in mind the following suggestions, 75 per cent of the hardships of passengers will disappear in a moment: 1. You will lose nothing, and others will gain through your restraint, if, instead of pushing yourself forward when getting to the platform or boarding the train, you dont mind being the last and act accordingly.
('15', 236, 1, 3, 462029) 2. Having taken your seat in the train, you should know that, up to the number indicated, others have as much right to a seat [in the compartment] as you.
('15', 236, 1, 4, 462184) Hence, if you stop others from entering, you will violate the moral law through falsehood and will also break a Railway regulation.
('15', 236, 1, 5, 462316) 3. If you have with you only as much luggage as third class passengers are entitled to carry, others will be able to sit in comfort.
('15', 236, 1, 6, 462449) If you can afford to carry more luggage, you had better put the excess in the luggage van and pay the additional charge.
('15', 236, 1, 7, 462570) 4. Your luggage should be of a kind that can be easily stowed away under a bench or placed on the shelf.
('15', 236, 1, 8, 462675) 5. If you are well to do and have no philanthropic intentions, you should seek your comfort by purchasing an upper class ticket.
('15', 236, 1, 9, 462804) By purchasing a third class ticket out of sheer miserliness, you will make yourself a burden on the poor.
('15', 236, 1, 10, 462910) But even if you do not want to travel upper class, you should certainly not use your funds so as to make your luggage and yourself a nuisance to your fellow passengers.
('15', 236, 1, 11, 463079) 6. You should bear in mind that all long distance passengers are entitled to some facility for sleeping; you can have, therefore, no more than your share of sleep.
('15', 236, 1, 12, 463243) 7. If you are a smoker, you should consider that, being in a train, you can smoke only with others permission and so as not to inconvenience them.
('15', 236, 1, 13, 463390) 8. If, when you want to spit, you do so where the passengers rest their feet, the place will become extremely dirty and there is a risk of one contracting some disease; those other passengers, moreover, who are particular about rules of cleanliness will find your dirty habit intolerably painful.
('15', 236, 1, 14, 463687) 9. If you use the railway lavatories with due care, everyone will be the happier for that.
('15', 236, 1, 15, 463778) In using them carelessly, you take no thought of the passengers who may follow you.

('15', 237, 1, 2, 463904) 10. Instead of making distinctions when you travel, such as that you are a brahmin or a Vaisya or a Sudra and someone else belongs to another class or that you are a Hindu and another a Muslim, or that you are from Bombay Presidency and another from Madras Presidency, and creating ill will in consequence, if you think of all as children of India who have for the once assembled under one roof, and cherish a brotherly feeling for all, you will be happy this very moment and bring glory to India.

('15', 237, 5, 6, 464507) July 27, 1916
('15', 237, 6, 7, 464521) In brief, the significance of satyagraha consists in the quest for a principle of life.
('15', 237, 6, 8, 464609) We did not say to anyone in so many words that our fight was in pursuance of this quest.
('15', 237, 6, 9, 464698) If we had said so, the people there would only have laughed at us.
('15', 237, 6, 10, 464765) We only made known the secondary aim of our movement, which was that the Government there, thinking us lowly and mean, was making laws to oust us from the country, and that it was right for us to defy these laws and show that we were brave.
('15', 237, 6, 11, 465006) Suppose the Government passes a law saying that Coloured persons shall wear yellow caps; in fact, a law of this kind was made in Rome for the Jews.
('15', 237, 6, 12, 465154) If the Government intended to treat us in a similar fashion and made a Law that appeared to humiliate us, it was for us to make it clear to the Government that we would not obey such a law.
('15', 237, 6, 13, 465344) If a child says to his father: Please put on your turban the wrong side up for me, the father understands that the child wants to have a laugh at his expense and at once obeys the command.
('15', 237, 6, 14, 465533) But when someone else, with uncharitable motives, says the same thing, he clearly answers, Look, brother, so long as my head is on my shoulders, you cannot humiliate me in this manner.
('15', 237, 6, 15, 465718) You conquer my head first and then make me wear my turban in any fashion you please. The Government there in a similar way, thinking the Indians lowly, wanted to treat them as slaves and as far as possible to prevent their coming

('15', 238, 1, 2, 466089) into the country.
('15', 238, 1, 3, 466107) And with this end in view, it began inventing ever new laws such as putting names of Indians in a separate register, making them give finger prints in the manner of thieves and bandits, forcing them to live in particular areas, forbidding their movement beyond a specified boundary, making rules for them to walk on particular foot paths and board specified carriages in trains, treating their wives as concubines if they could not produce marriage certificates, levying from them an annual tax of forty five rupees per capita, etc., etc.
('15', 238, 1, 4, 466646) Often a disease manifests itself in the body in various forms.
('15', 238, 1, 5, 466709) The disease in this case, as has been explained, was the evil purpose of the Government of South Africa, and all the rules and regulations mentioned above were the various forms that it took.
('15', 238, 1, 6, 466901) We, therefore, had to prepare ourselves to fight against these.
('15', 238, 1, 7, 466965) There are two ways of countering injustice.
('15', 238, 1, 8, 467009) One way is to smash the head of the man who perpetrates injustice and to get your own head smashed in the process.
('15', 238, 1, 9, 467124) All strong people in the world adopt this course.
('15', 238, 1, 10, 467174) Everywhere wars are fought and millions of people are killed.
('15', 238, 1, 11, 467236) The consequence is not the progress of a nation but its decline.
('15', 238, 1, 12, 467301) Soldiers returning from the front have become so bereft of reason that they indulge in various anti social activities.
('15', 238, 1, 13, 467420) One does not have to go far for examples.
('15', 238, 1, 14, 467462) In the Boer War, when the British won a victory at Mafeking, the whole of England, and London in particular, went so mad with joy that for days on end everyone did nothing but dance night and day!
('15', 238, 1, 15, 467659) They freely indulged in wickednesses and rowdyism and did not leave a single bar with a drop of liquor in it.
('15', 238, 1, 16, 467769) The Times, commenting, said that no words could describe the way those few days were spent, that all that could be said was that the English nation went amafficking [a Mafeking].
('15', 238, 1, 17, 467948) 1 Pride makes a victorious nation bad tempered.
('15', 238, 1, 18, 467996) It falls into luxurious ways of living.
('15', 238, 1, 19, 468036) Then for a time, it may be conceded, peace prevails.
('15', 238, 1, 20, 468089) But after a short while, it comes more and more to be realized that the seeds of war have not been destroyed but have become a thousand times more nourished and mighty.
('15', 238, 1, 21, 468258) No country has ever become, or will ever become, happy through victory in war.
('15', 238, 1, 22, 468337) A nation does not rise that way, it only falls further.
('15', 238, 1, 23, 468393) In fact, what comes to it is defeat, not victory.
('15', 238, 1, 24, 468443) And if, perchance, either our act or our purpose was ill conceived, it brings disaster to both belligerents.
('15', 238, 2, 25, 468552) 1 The London crowds behaved extravagantly on the relief of Mafeking (May 17, 1900).
('15', 239, 0, 1, 468636) 240 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 239, 1, 2, 468678) But through the other method of combating injustice, we alone suffer the consequences of our mistakes, and the other side is wholly spared.
('15', 239, 1, 3, 468818) This other method is satyagraha.
('15', 239, 1, 4, 468851) One who resorts to it does not have to break anothers head; he may merely have his own head broken.
('15', 239, 1, 5, 468951) He has to be prepared to die himself suffering all the pain.
('15', 239, 1, 6, 469012) In opposing the atrocious laws of the Government of South Africa, it was this method that we adopted.
('15', 239, 1, 7, 469114) We made it clear to the said Government that we would never bow to its outrageous laws.
('15', 239, 1, 8, 469202) No clapping is possible without two hands to do it, and no quarrel without two persons to make it.
('15', 239, 1, 9, 469301) Similarly, no State is possible without two entities [the rulers and the ruled].
('15', 239, 1, 10, 469382) You are our sovereign, our Government, only so long as we consider ourselves your subjects.
('15', 239, 1, 11, 469474) When we are not subjects, you are not the sovereign either.
('15', 239, 1, 12, 469534) So long as it is your endeavour to control us with justice and love, we will let you to do so.
('15', 239, 1, 13, 469629) But if you wish to strike at us from behind, we cannot permit it.
('15', 239, 1, 14, 469695) Whatever you do in other matters, you will have to ask our opinion about the laws that concern us.
('15', 239, 1, 15, 469794) If you make laws to keep us suppressed in a wrongful manner and without taking us into confidence, these laws will merely adorn the statute books.
('15', 239, 1, 16, 469941) We will never obey them.
('15', 239, 1, 17, 469966) Award us for it what punishment you like, we will put up with it.
('15', 239, 1, 18, 470032) Send us to prison and we will live there as in a paradise.
('15', 239, 1, 19, 470091) Ask us to mount the scaffold and we will do so laughing.
('15', 239, 1, 20, 470148) Shower what sufferings you like upon us, we will calmly endure all and not hurt a hair of your body.
('15', 239, 1, 21, 470249) We will gladly die and will not so much as touch you.
('15', 239, 1, 22, 470303) But so long as there is yet life in these our bones, we will never comply with your arbitrary laws.
('15', 239, 2, 23, 470403) It all began on a Sunday evening in Johannesburg when I sat on a hillock with another gentleman called Hemchandra.
('15', 239, 2, 24, 470518) The memory of that day is so vivid that it might have been yesterday.
('15', 239, 2, 25, 470588) At my side lay a Government Gazette.
('15', 239, 2, 26, 470625) It contained the several clauses of the law concerning Indians.
('15', 239, 2, 27, 470689) As I read it, I shook with rage.
('15', 239, 2, 28, 470722) What did the Government take us for?
('15', 239, 2, 29, 470759) Then and there I produced a translation of that portion of the Gazette which contained the said laws and wrote under it: I will never let these laws govern me. This was at once sent for publication to Indian Opinion at Phoenix.
('15', 239, 2, 30, 470987) I did not dream at the time that even a single Indian would be capable of the unprecedented heroism the Indians revealed or that the satyagraha movement would gain the momentum it did.
('15', 239, 3, 31, 471172) Immediately, I made my view known to fellow Indians and
('15', 240, 0, 1, 471228) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 241
('15', 240, 1, 2, 471270) many of them declared their readiness for satyagraha.
('15', 240, 1, 3, 471324) In the first conflict, people took part under the impression that our aim would be gained after only a few days of suffering.
('15', 240, 1, 4, 471450) In the second conflict, there were only a very few people to begin with but later many more came along.
('15', 240, 1, 5, 471554) Afterwards when, on the visit of Mr. Gokhale, the Government of South Africa pledged itself to a settlement, the fight ceased.
('15', 240, 1, 6, 471681) Later, the Government treacherously refused to honour its pledge; on which a third satyagraha battle became necessary.
('15', 240, 1, 7, 471800) Gokhale at that time asked me how many people I thought would take part in the satyagraha.
('15', 240, 1, 8, 471891) I wrote saying they would be between 30 and 60. But I could not find even that number.
('15', 240, 1, 9, 471978) Only 16 of us took up the challenge.
('15', 240, 1, 10, 472015) We were firmly decided that so long as the Government did not repeal its atrocious laws or make some settlement, we would accept every penalty but would not submit.
('15', 240, 1, 11, 472180) We had never hoped that we should find many fellow fighters.
('15', 240, 1, 12, 472241) But the readiness of one person without self interest to offer himself for the cause of truth and country always has its effect.
('15', 240, 1, 13, 472370) Soon there were twenty thousand people in the movement.
('15', 240, 1, 14, 472426) There was no room for them in the prisons, and the blood of India boiled.
('15', 240, 1, 15, 472500) Many people say that if Lord Hardinge had not intervened, a compromise would have been impossible.
('15', 240, 1, 16, 472599) But these people forget to ask themselves why it was that Lord Hardinge intervened.
('15', 240, 1, 17, 472683) The sufferings of the Canadian Indians were far greater than those of the South African Indians.
('15', 240, 1, 18, 472780) Why did he not use his good offices there?
('15', 240, 1, 19, 472823) Where the spiritual might of thousands of men and women has been mustered, where innumerable men and women are eager to lay down their lives, what indeed is impossible?
('15', 240, 1, 20, 472992) There was no other course open for Lord Hardinge than to offer mediation and he only showed his wisdom in adopting it.
('15', 240, 1, 21, 473111) What transpired later is well known to you: the Government of South Africa was compelled to come to terms with us.
('15', 240, 1, 22, 473226) All of which goes to show that we can gain everything without hurting anybody and through soul force or satyagraha alone.
('15', 240, 1, 23, 473348) He who fights with arms has to depend on arms and on support from others.
('15', 240, 1, 24, 473422) He has to turn from the straight path and seek tortuous tracks.
('15', 240, 1, 25, 473486) The course that a satyagrahi adopts in his fight is straight and he need look to no one for help.
('15', 240, 1, 26, 473584) He can, if necessary, fight by himself alone.
('15', 240, 1, 27, 473630) In that case, it is true, the outcome will be somewhat delayed.
('15', 240, 1, 28, 473694) If I had not found as many comrades in the South African fight as I did, all that would have happened is that you would not have seen me here in your midst today.
('15', 240, 1, 29, 473857) Perhaps all my life would have had to be spent in the struggle there.
('15', 240, 1, 30, 473927) But what of that?
('15', 240, 1, 31, 473945) The gain
('15', 241, 0, 1, 473954) 242 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 241, 1, 2, 473996) that has been secured would only have been a little late in coming.
('15', 241, 1, 3, 474064) For the battle of satyagraha one only needs to prepare oneself.
('15', 241, 1, 4, 474128) We have to have strict self control.
('15', 241, 1, 5, 474165) If it is necessary for this preparation to live in forests and caves, we should do so.
('15', 241, 1, 6, 474252) The time that may be taken up in this preparation should not be considered wasted.
('15', 241, 1, 7, 474335) Christ, before he went out to serve the world, spent forty days in the wilderness, preparing himself for his mission.
('15', 241, 1, 8, 474453) Buddha too spent many years in such preparation.
('15', 241, 1, 9, 474502) Had Christ and Buddha not undergone this preparation, they would not have been what they were.
('15', 241, 1, 10, 474597) Similarly, if we want to put this body in the service of truth and humanity, we must first raise our soul by developing virtues like celibacy, non violence and truth.
('15', 241, 1, 11, 474764) Then alone may we say that we are fit to render real service to the country.
('15', 241, 1, 12, 474841) In brief, the aim of the satyagraha struggle was to infuse manliness in cowards and to develop the really human virtues, and its field was the passive resistance against the Government of South Africa.

('15', 242, 9, 10, 475899) DEAR MR. PETIT, I have yours of the 11th instant.
('15', 242, 9, 11, 475949) I have been a few days answering your letter as I have been able only today to spare a few minutes for going into a/cs.
('15', 242, 9, 12, 476069) As a result I feel that the minimum required for the Passive Resisters here who are receiving support is likely to be Rs. l5,000. In going through the accounts I observe that I have overdrawn on the Passive Resistance account more than Rs. 500. Will you therefore kindy favour me with the cheque for Rs. 1000 on a/c.
('15', 242, 9, 13, 476386) I have not received the balance from South Africa.
('15', 242, 9, 14, 476437) 2 As I have already informed you, 3 disbursements have still to be made there.
('15', 242, 9, 15, 476516) It will be some time before they would be able to .say what sum they would require there in South Africa.

('15', 243, 2, 3, 476860) AHMEDABAD, September 5 [1916] 1
('15', 243, 3, 4, 476892) MY DEAR MILLIE, I have your letter today.
('15', 243, 3, 5, 476934) Even if Henry comes, you will be there to receive this letter.
('15', 243, 3, 6, 476997) I had Henrys long letter but I did not wish to interfere with his plans, so I said nothing.
('15', 243, 3, 7, 477089) I quite share your feeling that if his stay there can only increase the bitterness of his soul, it is better that he should not be so near the fire.
('15', 243, 3, 8, 477238) All the same it will be a calamity for South Africa, his permanent withdrawal.
('15', 243, 3, 9, 477317) Both the races will lose a common friend.
('15', 243, 3, 10, 477359) But at times, it is better to lose ones friends.
('15', 243, 3, 11, 477408) We sometimes know them only after the are gone.
('15', 243, 3, 12, 477456) Yes, you will feel very lonely.
('15', 243, 3, 13, 477488) I fear very much that you will never have a really settled life.
('15', 243, 3, 14, 477553) You will, therefore, have to find peace in preparedness to move on when required.
('15', 243, 3, 15, 477635) I do not share Henrys optimism about the London practice.
('15', 243, 3, 16, 477693) Anyway I shall be perfectly useless in helping him in that direction.
('15', 243, 3, 17, 477763) I know not a soul to whom I could appeal for such help.
('15', 243, 3, 18, 477819) If however, he cannot find his way to settle in London, he will find little difficulty in doing so here.
('15', 243, 3, 19, 477924) There is ample scope for his energy in India.
('15', 243, 3, 20, 477970) But I will not anticipate the future.
('15', 243, 3, 21, 478008) I do not fear the intimate issue.
('15', 243, 3, 22, 478042) We have a common belief in the goodness of God.
('15', 243, 3, 23, 478090) Though the path immediately in front of us may be full of darkness, as to the destination to be reached, there never would be any doubt.
('15', 243, 3, 24, 478227) Of course, I shall go to Bombay to meet Henry unless his coming synchronizes with the Provincial Conference meeting here.
('15', 243, 3, 25, 478349) Morgan Bush affair is a sad thing.
('15', 243, 3, 26, 478384) Thambi never wrote again to me.
('15', 243, 3, 27, 478416) I am ready to send the boys if he wants them.
('15', 243, 3, 28, 478462) We are here a busy nine all engaged in hand weaving.
('15', 243, 3, 29, 478515) To me it appears as a great thing.
('15', 243, 3, 30, 478550) But we shall see.
('15', 243, 3, 31, 478568) Just now we expect that we shall be self supporting in a years time through this work.

('15', 244, 5, 7, 479123) AHMEDABAD, September 10, 1916
('15', 244, 6, 8, 479153) MY DEAR FRIEND, I was examining yesterday one of your boxes to see if time had done any damage.
('15', 244, 6, 9, 479249) I did not see much damage done but it brought to mind the old days when we cooked our own meals.
('15', 244, 6, 10, 479346) I compared those times to the present ones.
('15', 244, 6, 11, 479390) It saddened me to think that you were not here to share the greater simplicity.
('15', 244, 6, 12, 479470) Everything in the box that I examined betrayed greater luxury than is allowed at present.
('15', 244, 6, 13, 479560) I cannot give you an adequate picture of it.
('15', 244, 6, 14, 479605) The life has to be seen.
('15', 244, 6, 15, 479630) There is much left undone before the life can become grandly simple.
('15', 244, 6, 16, 479699) There is a shoddiness about it which I would like to get rid of.
('15', 244, 6, 17, 479764) But that cannot be until we have built our own cottages.
('15', 244, 6, 18, 479821) News from South Africa show that Polak may leave South Africa in October for India.
('15', 244, 6, 19, 479905) He does not want to settle here.
('15', 244, 6, 20, 479938) He wants to see if he can get Indian connections for practice in London.
('15', 244, 6, 21, 480011) There is not much hope of it.
('15', 244, 6, 22, 480041) I know you write regularly but the delivery has become irregular.
('15', 244, 6, 23, 480107) There is again nothing from you this week.
('15', 244, 6, 24, 480150) I hope mine you receive regularly.
('15', 244, 6, 25, 480185) There is again a storm in the Ashram.
('15', 244, 6, 26, 480223) The Pariah family had temporarily gone.
('15', 244, 6, 27, 480263) They returned yesterday.
('15', 244, 6, 28, 480288) Mrs. Maganlal therefore suddenly decided to leave.
('15', 244, 6, 29, 480339) I offered no opposition and she with her children has gone to Rajkot.
('15', 244, 6, 30, 480409) Poor Maganlal!
('15', 244, 6, 31, 480424) He is going through the most terrible times of his life.
('15', 244, 6, 32, 480481) He feels most keenly this separation from those that [are] nearest him.
('15', 244, 6, 33, 480553) He does not know what his duty is.
('15', 244, 6, 34, 480588) He does not want to leave me and he can hardly bear the present blow.
('15', 244, 6, 35, 480658) The Maganlal of olden days  robust, jovial, quickhanded and quick witted is no more to be seen.
('15', 244, 6, 36, 480754) He has aged.
('15', 244, 6, 37, 480767) He is careworn.
('15', 244, 6, 38, 480783) He is rarely healthy.
('15', 244, 6, 39, 480805) He is absent minded, without hope, without peace.
('15', 244, 6, 40, 480855) I do not
('15', 245, 0, 1, 480864) 246 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 245, 1, 2, 480906) know what to do for him and how to help him.
('15', 245, 1, 3, 480951) One can only trust that time will heal all the wounds and that he will yet be his old self again.
('15', 245, 1, 4, 481049) Manilal is at Madras ever finding out ways of ease and luxury.
('15', 245, 1, 5, 481112) The life of discipline is gone for him.
('15', 245, 1, 6, 481152) That of indulgence has begun.
('15', 245, 1, 7, 481182) He has seen friends.
('15', 245, 1, 8, 481203) They have begun to fondle him.
('15', 245, 1, 9, 481234) He has not been able to resist them.
('15', 245, 1, 10, 481271) Heaven knows what he will now be when he returns from Madras.
('15', 245, 1, 11, 481333) Most of the inmates of the Ashram have gone out for a picnic.
('15', 245, 1, 12, 481395) They have taken roasted wheat and gram flour with them for food with radishes as a salad.
('15', 245, 1, 13, 481485) The distance is only five miles.
('15', 245, 1, 14, 481518) They return in the evening.

('15', 245, 6, 20, 481710) AHMEDABAD, September 14, 1916
('15', 245, 7, 21, 481740) MY DEAR FRIEND, I was assisting the carpenter yesterday.
('15', 245, 7, 22, 481797) Here carpenters have to practically make their own tools.
('15', 245, 7, 23, 481855) They make their own handles.
('15', 245, 7, 24, 481884) They turn one tool into some other.
('15', 245, 7, 25, 481920) The carpenter here wanted a handle to his screwdriver.
('15', 245, 7, 26, 481975) I had to assist him at that.
('15', 245, 7, 27, 482004) He made it out of a piece of ebony.
('15', 245, 7, 28, 482040) I thought he had turned out a piece of art in about two hours.
('15', 245, 7, 29, 482103) You will probably laugh at it.
('15', 245, 7, 30, 482134) As I was sitting opposite the carpenter, I thought of you and asked myself what you would say to it all  the manner of working it, pressing two hours in the middle of his work, giving so much time to a mere handle!
('15', 245, 7, 31, 482349) Such is life here.
('15', 245, 7, 32, 482368) For me there is poetry in it.
('15', 245, 7, 33, 482398) There is no mad rush in this sort of life.
('15', 245, 7, 34, 482441) Polak is expected here in a months time.
('15', 245, 7, 35, 482482) There is no cable yet.
('15', 245, 7, 36, 482505) I may receive one any day.
('15', 245, 7, 37, 482532) Naransamy, Parthasarathy and Bala are all down.
('15', 245, 7, 38, 482580) The first two have a violent attack of indigestion.
('15', 245, 7, 39, 482632) Naransamy is out of danger now.
('15', 245, 7, 40, 482664) The other two have been very severely ill but they were never in the danger zone.
('15', 245, 7, 41, 482746) All have yielded to home treatment.

('15', 246, 4, 7, 483018) AHMEDABAD, September 14, 1916
('15', 246, 5, 8, 483048) MY DEAR WEST, I have your letter and copy of letter to Mr. Rustomjee.
('15', 246, 5, 9, 483118) You know that my heart is with you.
('15', 246, 5, 10, 483154) I will say nothing about your letter except to say that it hurts me to think that you felt so hurt.
('15', 246, 5, 11, 483254) For once you have taken Mr. Rustomjee seriously.
('15', 246, 5, 12, 483303) I know that you must soon after writing that letter have regained your usual gaiety and philosophic calm.
('15', 246, 5, 13, 483409) In any event this is merely to say that you have the power to vote to yourself as much as you need per month.
('15', 246, 5, 14, 483519) Please use it without hesitation.
('15', 246, 5, 15, 483553) Funds you have there.
('15', 246, 5, 16, 483575) I shall answer for you and your use of them.
('15', 246, 5, 17, 483620) I see nothing wrong in your using the funds.
('15', 246, 5, 18, 483665) They were sent for the struggle.
('15', 246, 5, 19, 483698) You and a few others now are in the struggle which must be maintained.
('15', 246, 5, 20, 483769) I hope therefore that you will not argue with me again about the rightness of the act.
('15', 246, 5, 21, 483856) Imam Saheb now sees the thing properly.
('15', 246, 6, 22, 483896) Mr. Petit has asked me more than once for the balance of the fund.
('15', 246, 6, 23, 483963) What is the balance there now.
('15', 246, 6, 24, 483994) Do please also send me the items of expenditure after the date up to which the accounts were rendered.
('15', 246, 6, 25, 484097) We return only the balance which is left after providing for your losses there.
('15', 246, 7, 26, 484177) It is sad to think that Polak leaves South Africa.
('15', 246, 7, 27, 484228) He is a big asset.
('15', 246, 7, 28, 484247) We are mad after handloom work.
('15', 246, 7, 29, 484279) So more later.

('15', 247, 3, 6, 484575) You have never been out of [my] mind.
('15', 247, 3, 7, 484613) I have not been a regular letter writer as other duties have claimed me almost exclusively.
('15', 247, 3, 8, 484705) My heart goes out to you all.
('15', 247, 3, 9, 484735) You have my full sympathy and support.
('15', 247, 3, 10, 484774) I entirely agree with you that you must have enough to maintain yourselves.
('15', 247, 3, 11, 484850) Albert has the power in his own hands, and I am asking him to use it freely.
('15', 247, 3, 12, 484927) You will learn more from my letter 1 to Albert.
('15', 247, 3, 13, 484975) Do let me have a cheerful letter in reply.

('15', 247, 9, 21, 485395) In my view, for women as well as men, Tulsis Ramayana seems the best.
('15', 247, 9, 22, 485465) All Hindus must be conversant with the Gita.
('15', 247, 9, 23, 485510) Complete education here must include elementary arithmetic and geography.
('15', 247, 9, 24, 485584) Moral education too is to be included and that would cover the duties of a housewife.
('15', 247, 9, 25, 485670) I have not found it necessary to give any special importance to music, drawing, etc.
('15', 247, 9, 26, 485755) Keeping in view the conditions in the country I feel a general knowledge of agriculture, and weaving, and health education should be included in the education for every

('15', 248, 1, 3, 486047) So long as we cannot create schools giving such education, all parents should themselves educate their children or engage private tutors.

('15', 248, 8, 11, 486392) These sheets are old and pleasant reminders.
('15', 248, 8, 12, 486437) I am using up all this stock.
('15', 248, 9, 13, 486467) I do not know that I shall welcome your exchange.
('15', 248, 9, 14, 486517) That may mean complete cutting off.
('15', 248, 9, 15, 486553) At the same time probably you are right in having accepted the exchange when you had the choice.
('15', 248, 9, 16, 486650) I shall eagerly await your letters until the fate is decided.Yes, Polak is coming.
('15', 248, 9, 17, 486733) He has not yet left South Africa for there is no cable.
('15', 248, 9, 18, 486789) He has not been appreciated.
('15', 248, 9, 19, 486818) Here we are still at the looms more concentrated than ever.
('15', 248, 10, 20, 486878) Parthasarathy and Bala I am presently sending to South Africa.
('15', 248, 10, 21, 486941) They want to go.

('15', 249, 6, 8, 487324) Sickness I cannot get rid of in spite of the greatest care and precaution.

('15', 249, 6, 13, 487531) Imam Saheb is just recovering.
('15', 249, 6, 14, 487562) The three Naidoo boys only just recovered.
('15', 249, 6, 15, 487605) This means nearly half the company needing attention.
('15', 249, 6, 16, 487659) If I had only doctoring and nursing to attend to I should not mind but the kitchen and the looms and some public work  this fills the cup.
('15', 249, 6, 17, 487798) And yet I know I should not mind.
('15', 249, 6, 18, 487832) I need Jobs patience.
('15', 249, 6, 19, 487854) All this news should make you see that yours is by no means the worst state and yet if you feel miserable it is clearly a case of mind is its own place, it can make heaven of hell and hell of heaven.

('15', 250, 1, 2, 488443) 191. ON AHIMSA: REPLY TO LALA LAJPAT RAI
('15', 250, 2, 3, 488484) October, 1916
('15', 250, 3, 4, 488498) Had Lala Lajpat Rai 1 first ascertained what I had actually said on ahimsa, his remarks 2 in The Modern Review for last July would not have seen the light of day.
('15', 250, 3, 5, 488661) Lalaji rightly questioned whether I actually made the statements imputed to me.
('15', 250, 3, 6, 488741) He says, that if I did not, I should have contradicted them.
('15', 250, 3, 7, 488802) In the first place, I have not yet seen the papers which have reported the remarks in question or those wherein my remarks were criticised.
('15', 250, 3, 8, 488942) Secondly, I must confess that I would not undertake to correct all the errors that creep into reports that appear in the public press about my speeches.
('15', 250, 3, 9, 489095) Lalajis article has been much quoted in the Gujarati newspapers and magazines; and it is perhaps as well for me to explain my position.
('15', 250, 3, 10, 489231) With due deference to Lalaji, I must join issue with him when he says that the elevation of the doctrine of ahimsa to the highest position contributed to the downfall of India.
('15', 250, 3, 11, 489408) There seems to be no historical warrant for the belief that an exaggerated practice of ahimsa synchronised with our becoming bereft of many virtues.
('15', 250, 3, 12, 489557) During the past fifteen hundred years, we have as a nation given ample proof of physical courage, but we have been torn by internal dissensions and have been dominated by love of self instead of love of country.
('15', 250, 3, 13, 489769) We have, that is to say, been swayed by the spirit of irreligion rather than of religion.
('15', 250, 4, 14, 489859) I do not know how far the charge of unmanliness can be made good against the Jains.
('15', 250, 4, 15, 489943) I hold no brief for them.
('15', 250, 4, 16, 489969) By birth I am a Vaishnavite 3, and was taught ahimsa in my childhood.
('15', 250, 4, 17, 490039) I have derived much religious benefit from Jain religious works, as I have from scriptures of the other great faiths of the world.
('15', 250, 4, 18, 490170) I owe much to the living company of the deceased philosopher Raja Chand Kavi 4 who was a Jain by birth.
('15', 250, 4, 19, 490274) Thus though my views on ahimsa are a result of my study of most of the faiths of the world, they are now no longer

('15', 251, 1, 2, 490809) dependent upon the authority of these works.
('15', 251, 1, 3, 490854) They are a partof my life and if I suddenly discovered that the religious books read by me bore a different interpretation from the one I had learnt to give them, I should still hold to the new of ahimsa as I am about to set forth here.
('15', 251, 2, 4, 491091) Our shastras seem to teach that a man who really practises ahimsa in its fullness has the world at his feet, he so affects his surroundings that even the snakes and other venomous reptiles do him no harm.
('15', 251, 2, 5, 491296) This is said to have been the experience of St. Francis of Assisi.
('15', 251, 3, 6, 491363) In its negative form, it means not injuring any living being, whether by body or mind.
('15', 251, 3, 7, 491450) I may not therefore hurt the person of any wrong doer, or bear any ill will to him and so cause him mental suffering.
('15', 251, 3, 8, 491568) This statement does not cover suffering caused to the wrong doer by natural acts of mine which do not proceed from ill will.
('15', 251, 3, 9, 491693) It, therefore, does not prevent me from withdrawing from his presence a child whom he, we shall imagine, is about to strike.
('15', 251, 3, 10, 491818) Indeed the proper practice of ahimsa required me to withdraw the intended victim from the wrong doer, if I am in any way whatsoever the guardian of such a child.
('15', 251, 3, 11, 491980) It was therefore most proper for the passive resisters of South Africa to have resisted the evil that the Union Government sought to do to them.
('15', 251, 3, 12, 492125) They bore no ill will to it.
('15', 251, 3, 13, 492154) They showed this by helping the Government whenever it needed their help.
('15', 251, 3, 14, 492228) Their resistance consisted of disobedience of the orders of the Government, even to the extent of suffering death at their hands.
('15', 251, 3, 15, 492358) Ahimsa requires deliberate self suffering, not a deliberate injuring of the supposed wrong doer.
('15', 251, 4, 16, 492455) In its positive form, ahimsa means the largest love, the greatest charity.
('15', 251, 4, 17, 492530) If I am a follower of ahimsa, I must love my enemy.
('15', 251, 4, 18, 492582) I must apply the same rule to the wrong doer who is my enemy or a stranger to me, as I would to my wrong doing father or son.
('15', 251, 4, 19, 492708) This active Ahimsa necessarily includes truth and fearlessness.
('15', 251, 4, 20, 492772) A man cannot deceive the loved ones; he does not fear or frighten him or her.
('15', 251, 4, 21, 492850) vHk;nku (Gift of life) is the greatest of all gifts.
('15', 251, 4, 22, 492903) A man who gives it in reality disarms all hostility.
('15', 251, 4, 23, 492956) He has paved the way for an honourable understanding.
('15', 251, 4, 24, 493010) And none who is himself subject to fear can bestow that gift.
('15', 251, 4, 25, 493072) He must therefore be himself fearless.
('15', 251, 4, 26, 493111) A man cannot then practise ahimsa and be a coward at the same time.
('15', 251, 4, 27, 493179) The practice of ahimsa calls forth the greatest courage.
('15', 251, 4, 28, 493236) It is the most soldierly of a

('15', 252, 1, 2, 493308) soldiers virtues.
('15', 252, 1, 3, 493326) General Gordon 1 has been represented in a famous statue as bearing only a stick.
('15', 252, 1, 4, 493408) This takes us far on the road to ahimsa.
('15', 252, 1, 5, 493449) But a soldier, who needs the protection of even a stick, is to that extent so much the less a soldier.
('15', 252, 1, 6, 493552) He is the true soldier who knows how to die and stand his ground in the midst of a hail of bullets.
('15', 252, 1, 7, 493652) Such a one was Ambarish who stood his ground without lifting a finger, though Durvasa did his worst?
('15', 252, 1, 8, 493753) The Moors, who were being powdered by the French gunners, rushed into the guns mouth with Allah on their lips, showed much the same type of courage.
('15', 252, 1, 9, 493902) Only theirs was the courage of desperation.
('15', 252, 1, 10, 493946) Ambarishs was due to love.
('15', 252, 1, 11, 493973) Yet the Moorish valour, readiness to die, conquered the gunners.
('15', 252, 1, 12, 494038) They frantically waved their hats, ceased firing and greeted their erstwhile enemies as comrades.
('15', 252, 1, 13, 494136) And so the South African passive resisters in their thousands were ready to die rather than sell their honour for a little personal ease.
('15', 252, 1, 14, 494274) This was ahimsa in its active form.
('15', 252, 1, 15, 494310) It never barters away honour.
('15', 252, 1, 16, 494340) A helpless girl in the hands of a follower of ahimsa finds better and surer protection than in the hands of one who is prepared to defend her only to the point to which his weapons would carry him.
('15', 252, 1, 17, 494538) The tyrant, in the first instance, will have to walk to his victim over the dead body of her defender, in the second, he has but to overpower the defender, for it is assumed that the canon of propriety in the second instance will be satisfied when the defender has fought to the extent of his physical valour.
('15', 252, 1, 18, 494848) In the first instance, as the defender has matched his very soul against the mere body of the tyrant, the odds are that the soul in the latter will be awakened, and the girl will stand an infinitely greater chance of her honour being protected than in any other conceivable circumstancebarring, of course, that of her own personal courage.
('15', 252, 1, 19, 495188) If we are unmanly today, we are so, not because we do not know how to strike, but because we fear to die.
('15', 252, 1, 20, 495294) He is no follower of Mahavira, the apostle of Jainism, or of Buddha or of the Vedas, who being afraid to die, takes flight before any danger, real or imaginary all the while wishing that some body else would remove the danger by destroying the person causing it.
('15', 252, 1, 21, 495557) He is no follower of ahimsa (I agree with Lalaji) who does not care a straw if he kills a man by inches by deceiving him in trade, or who will protect by force of arms a few cows and make away with the butcher, or who in order to do a

('15', 253, 1, 3, 496048) All these are actuated by hatred, cowardice and fear.
('15', 253, 1, 4, 496102) Here love of the cow or the country is a vague thing intended to satisfy ones vanity or soothe a stinging conscience.
('15', 253, 1, 5, 496220) Ahimsa, truly understood, is, in my humble opinion, apanacea for all evils mundane and extra mundane.
('15', 253, 1, 6, 496322) We can never overdo it.
('15', 253, 1, 7, 496346) Just at present, we are not doing it at all.
('15', 253, 1, 8, 496391) Ahimsa does not displace the practice of other virtues, but renders their practice imperatively necessary before it can be practised even in its rudiments.
('15', 253, 1, 9, 496547) Lalaji need not fear the ahimsa of his fathers faith.
('15', 253, 1, 10, 496601) Mahavira and Buddha were soldiers, and so was Tolstoy.
('15', 253, 1, 11, 496656) Only they saw deeper and truer in their profession, and found the secret of a true, happy, honourable and godly life.

('15', 253, 4, 15, 496922) 192. THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF EDUCATION 1
('15', 253, 5, 16, 496961) The word education is on everyones lips these days.
('15', 253, 5, 17, 497013) The schoolswhether Government or privateare packed with students.
('15', 253, 5, 18, 497079) There is not enough accommodation in colleges.
('15', 253, 5, 19, 497126) A number of students seeking admission to Gujarat College had to go back disappointed.
('15', 253, 5, 20, 497213) Despite this infatuation for education, hardly anyone pauses to consider what education really is, whether the education we have so far received has done us any good, or good commensurate with the effort put in.
('15', 253, 5, 21, 497425) We think as little about the meaning of education, as about its aims and objects!
('15', 253, 5, 22, 497507) For most people the main aim seems to be to qualify for some kind of a job.
('15', 253, 5, 23, 497583) Usually, people belonging to different trades or vocations, on receiving this education, give up their traditional modes of earning a livelihood and look instead for jobs and, when they succeed, think that they have risen a step higher.
('15', 253, 5, 24, 497820) In our schools we find boys belonging to various vocational communities such as masons, blacksmiths, carpenters, tailors, cobblers, etc.
('15', 253, 5, 25, 497957) But, on receiving education, instead of improving the standards of their traditional vocations, they give them up as

('15', 254, 1, 2, 498219) something inherently inferior and consider it an honour to become clerks.
('15', 254, 1, 3, 498293) The parents too share this false notion.
('15', 254, 1, 4, 498334) Thus, disloyal both to caste and to the functions most natural to us, we sink deeper into slavery.
('15', 254, 1, 5, 498433) During my tours, I found this condition prevailing everywhere in India and it has often made my heart bleed.
('15', 254, 1, 6, 498542) Education is not an end in itself but only a means and that alone can be called education which makes us men of character.
('15', 254, 1, 7, 498665) No one can claim that the education being given in our schools produces this result.
('15', 254, 1, 8, 498750) Rather, we shall come across many instances of young people having dissipated their character while at school.
('15', 254, 1, 9, 498861) An impartial English writer has said that as long as there is no continuity between schools and homes in India, the pupils will not have the benefit of either.
('15', 254, 1, 10, 499021) Our youths learn one thing from parents at home and from the general environment, and another at school.
('15', 254, 1, 11, 499126) The pattern at school is often found incompatible with that in the home.
('15', 254, 1, 12, 499199) The lessons in our readers are regarded as of little relevance to conduct.
('15', 254, 1, 13, 499274) We cannot put the knowledge so acquired to any practical use in our daily life.
('15', 254, 1, 14, 499354) The parents are indifferent to what is taught at school.
('15', 254, 1, 15, 499411) The labour spent on studies is considered useless drudgery which has to be gone through that one might take the final examination, and once this is over we manage to forget as quickly as possible what we had studied.
('15', 254, 1, 16, 499628) The charge levelled against us by some Englishmen that we are mere imitators is not entirely baseless.
('15', 254, 1, 17, 499731) One of them, in his arrogance, has likened us to blotting paper in relation to civilization.
('15', 254, 1, 18, 499824) He believes that as blotting paper absorbs the superfluous ink, even so we take in only the superfluities, that is the evils of Western civilization.
('15', 254, 1, 19, 499974) That, indeed, we must admit, is our condition to some extent.
('15', 254, 1, 20, 500036) Thinking about the causes of this condition, I have come to the conclusion that the chief fault lies in education being imparted to us through the medium of English.
('15', 254, 1, 21, 500202) It takes about twelve years to get the matriculation certificate.
('15', 254, 1, 22, 500268) We acquire precious little of knowledge over this long period.
('15', 254, 1, 23, 500331) Our main effort is not directed towards integrating any such knowledge with our work and putting it to practical use, but towards gaining, somehow, command of the English language.
('15', 254, 1, 24, 500512) It has been stated by experts that, if what has to be taught to the students up to the matriculation class was imparted to them through their own mother tongue, there would be a saving of at least five years.
('15', 254, 1, 25, 500721) At this rate, on ten thousand matriculates, the people are put to a loss of fifty thousand years!
('15', 254, 1, 26, 500819) This is a very grave situation.
('15', 254, 1, 27, 500851) Not only that, we also impoverish our own languages in this way.
('15', 254, 1, 28, 500916) When I hear people say
('15', 255, 0, 1, 500939) 256 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 255, 1, 2, 500981) as they often do that Gujarati is a poor language, it makes me feel indignant.
('15', 255, 1, 3, 501060) If Gujarati, a beloved daughter of Sanskrit, is poor, the fault is not that of the language, but of ourselves who are its guardians.
('15', 255, 1, 4, 501193) We have neglected it and despised it.
('15', 255, 1, 5, 501231) How can it then acquire the lustre and strength which it ought to have?
('15', 255, 1, 6, 501303) A gulf has been created between us and our families.
('15', 255, 1, 7, 501356) To our parents, to others in our families, to our women, and to our domesticswith whom we live for the greater part of our timeour school education is as some hidden wealth.
('15', 255, 1, 8, 501530) Its use is denied to them.
('15', 255, 1, 9, 501557) It should be easy enough for us to see that where conditions are so unnatural, the people can never hope to rise.
('15', 255, 1, 10, 501671) If we were not mere pieces of blotting paper, after fifty years of this education we should have witnessed a new spirit in our masses.
('15', 255, 1, 11, 501806) But we have no bond of understanding with them.
('15', 255, 1, 12, 501854) They look upon us as modernized and keep away from us and we look upon them as an uncivilized lot and despise them.
('15', 255, 2, 13, 501970) Turning to higher education being imparted in colleges, we find the same state of affairs.
('15', 255, 2, 14, 502061) We waste a good deal of our time there, seeking to put our knowledge on a surer foundation.
('15', 255, 2, 15, 502153) We begin there to grow indifferent to our own language.
('15', 255, 2, 16, 502209) Many of us even develop a feeling of contempt towards the mother tongue.
('15', 255, 2, 17, 502282) We communicate with one another in English, full of errors in pronunciation and grammar.
('15', 255, 2, 18, 502371) We have not yet coined in our own languages correct technical terms for various sciences, and we do not fully understand the English terms.
('15', 255, 2, 19, 502511) By the time we have done with our college education, our intelligence loses all vigour and our bodies their strength.
('15', 255, 2, 20, 502629) The medicine bottle becomes our life long companion.
('15', 255, 2, 21, 502682) And yet the people think, and we too, that we are their ornament, their guardians and the makers of their future.
('15', 255, 3, 22, 502796) If the young men of Gujarat who pass out of various colleges seriously mean to become as guardians to the people, I should regard them as brave.
('15', 255, 3, 23, 502941) Although I have drawn a very gloomy picture of our system of education, yet in this gloom lie seeds that may grow into hope.
('15', 255, 3, 24, 503066) I do not mean to suggest in this article that no Indian should know English.
('15', 255, 3, 25, 503143) Let us; do what they have done in Russia and what they are doing in South Africa and Japan.
('15', 255, 3, 26, 503235) In Japan, a few selected people acquire a high knowledge of English, translate whatever is worth importing from European civilization into their own language and so make it accessible to all, thus saving the people from the useless labour of having to learn English themselves.
('15', 255, 3, 27, 503513) Quite a large number among us are familiar with English.
('15', 255, 3, 28, 503570) They may further increase their

('15', 256, 1, 2, 503644) knowledge of it.
('15', 256, 1, 3, 503661) And those whose health allows it and whose mental vigour is still intact may undertake to translate into Gujarati such ideas from English and other foreign languages as are likely to do good to our masses.
('15', 256, 1, 4, 503867) If we strive long enough, we can change the present trend of education and impart the knowledge of new sciences and new ideas only through the medium of Gujarati.
('15', 256, 1, 5, 504030) It is not impossible to impart the knowledge of the sciences of medicine, navigation and electricity through Gujarati.
('15', 256, 1, 6, 504149) It is absurd to think that one can have a knowledge of anatomy or perform an operation of bone surgery only after one has acquired a knowledge of English.
('15', 256, 1, 7, 504304) Not less than eighty five per cent of Indias population are engaged in agriculture.
('15', 256, 1, 8, 504388) Ten per cent are engaged in various other crafts and a majority of them are weavers.
('15', 256, 1, 9, 504473) The remaining five per cent belong to the various professions.
('15', 256, 1, 10, 504536) If these latter really desire to serve the people, they must acquire some knowledge at least about the occupations of the ninety five per cent of the people.
('15', 256, 1, 11, 504694) And it should be the duty of the ninety five per cent to acquire a proper knowledge of their traditional occupations.
('15', 256, 1, 12, 504812) If this view be correct, our schools must provide for the teaching of these two occupationsagriculture and weaving to the pupils from childhood onwards.
('15', 256, 1, 13, 504965) In order to create the right conditions for imparting a good knowledge of agriculture and weaving, all our schools should be located, not in the densely populated parts of towns or cities, but in places where big farms may be developed and where classes may be conducted in the open air.
('15', 256, 1, 14, 505253) In such schools, sports for the boys will consist in ploughing the fields.
('15', 256, 1, 15, 505328) The idea that, if our boys and youths do not have football, cricket and such other games, their life should become too drab is completely erroneous.
('15', 256, 1, 16, 505477) The sons of our peasants never get a chance to play cricket, but there is no dearth of joy or innocent zest in their life.
('15', 256, 1, 17, 505600) Thus, it is not difficult to change the present trends in education.
('15', 256, 1, 18, 505669) Public opinion must be in favour of this change.
('15', 256, 1, 19, 505718) The Government then will have no option but to introduce changes.
('15', 256, 1, 20, 505784) Those who like the above scheme should come forward to undertake experiments on these lines while public opinion is in the making.
('15', 256, 1, 21, 505915) When the people see the happy results of these experiments, they will of their own accord want to take them up.
('15', 256, 1, 22, 506027) I think such experiments will not entail much expenditure.
('15', 256, 1, 23, 506086) I have not, however, written this article with a commercial mentality.
('15', 256, 1, 24, 506157) My chief object was to ask readers to consider the meaning of real education and I shall hold my effort to have been duly rewarded if this article is of any help to them.

('15', 257, 1, 2, 506443) 193. THE HINDU CASTE SYSTEM 1
('15', 257, 2, 3, 506473) The Hindu social structure has endured, I believe, on the foundation of the caste system.
('15', 257, 2, 4, 506563) Sir William Hunter says in his History of India that, thanks to the continuing existence of the institution of caste, there has been no need for any law for the poor (pauper law) in India.
('15', 257, 2, 5, 506752) This seems to me a sound view.
('15', 257, 2, 6, 506783) The caste system contains within it the seed of swaraj.
('15', 257, 2, 7, 506839) The different castes are so many divisions of an army.
('15', 257, 2, 8, 506894) The general does not know the soldiers individually but gets them to work through the respective captains.
('15', 257, 2, 9, 507001) In like manner, we can carry out social reform with ease through the agency of the caste system and order through it our religious, practical and moral affairs as we choose.
('15', 257, 2, 10, 507175) The caste system is a perfectly natural institution.
('15', 257, 2, 11, 507228) In our country, it has been invested with a religious meaning; elsewhere, its utility was not fully realized and so it remained a mere form, with the result that the countries concerned did not derive much benefit from it.
('15', 257, 2, 12, 507451) These being my views, I am opposed to the movements which are being carried on for the destruction of the system.
('15', 257, 2, 13, 507565) However, any defects in the caste system which we may find must certainly be removed and for that purpose we must first study its real nature.
('15', 257, 2, 14, 507708) As I pointed out earlier, we have given a religious meaning to the system.
('15', 257, 2, 15, 507783) It is merely an agency for ensuring self control.
('15', 257, 2, 16, 507833) The caste defines the limits within which one may enjoy life; that is to say, we are not free to seek any happiness outside the caste.
('15', 257, 2, 17, 507968) We do not associate with members of other communities for eating or enter into marriage relationships with them.
('15', 257, 2, 18, 508081) With an arrangement of this kind, there is a good chance that loose conduct will be kept down.
('15', 257, 2, 19, 508176) The idea that coming together for purposes of eating promotes friendship is contradicted by experience.
('15', 257, 2, 20, 508280) If it did, the great war being waged today in Europe would never have started.
('15', 257, 2, 21, 508359) The bitterest quarrels are among relatives.
('15', 257, 2, 22, 508403) We have needlessly exaggerated the importance of eating.
('15', 257, 2, 23, 508460) The process of eating is as unclean as evacuation, the only difference being that, while evacuation ends in a sense of relief, eating, if ones tongue is not held in control, brings
('15', 257, 3, 24, 508641) 1 The article was originally published in Bharat Sevak, a Marathi monthly, in its issue of October, 1916.
('15', 258, 0, 1, 508747) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 259
('15', 258, 1, 2, 508789) discomfort.
('15', 258, 1, 3, 508801) Just as we attend to evacuation, etc., in private, we should likewise eat and perform other actions common to all animals always in private.
('15', 258, 1, 4, 508942) The purpose of eating is to sustain the body.
('15', 258, 1, 5, 508988) If this statement is correct, obviously, the less ostentation we make about it, the better.
('15', 258, 1, 6, 509080) The same thing is true of marriage.
('15', 258, 1, 7, 509116) Prohibition of marriage with anyone not belonging to ones community promotes self control, and self control is conducive to happiness in all circumstances.
('15', 258, 1, 8, 509272) The larger the area over which the net is cast, the greater the risk.
('15', 258, 1, 9, 509342) That is the reason why I see nothing wrong in the practice of choosing the husband or the wife from among persons of equal birth.
('15', 258, 1, 10, 509472) Even in countries where class differentiation does not rest on religion, they guard against hybrid unions.
('15', 258, 1, 11, 509579) This is the meaning of the phrase blue blood in England.
('15', 258, 1, 12, 509636) Lord Salisbury 1 used to boast that he belonged to the same stock as Elizabeth.
('15', 258, 1, 13, 509716) It was a fact which seemed to him and the British people worth being proud of.
('15', 258, 2, 14, 509795) In this way, the restrictions in regard to eating and marriage are, as a general rule, wholesome.
('15', 258, 2, 15, 509893) There is, of course, and there will always be, room for exceptions.
('15', 258, 2, 16, 509961) This has been accepted by Hindu society, whether it knows the fact or not.
('15', 258, 2, 17, 510036) Rightly considered, however, there are no exceptions.
('15', 258, 2, 18, 510090) If I eat in the company of a Bhangi 2, there being, from my point of view, greater self control in doing so, the community should have nothing to do in the matter.
('15', 258, 2, 19, 510254) Or, if I fail to get a suitable bride from my own community and I am likely, if I remain unmarried, to contract vicious habits, it will, in these circumstances, be an act of self control on my part to marry a girl of my choice from any community and hence my action will not be a violation of the fundamental principle of the caste system.
('15', 258, 2, 20, 510594) It would be for me to demonstrate that my purpose in taking such a step in disregard of the general rule was discipline of the flesh, and this would appear from my subsequent conduct.
('15', 258, 2, 21, 510778) Meanwhile?
('15', 258, 2, 22, 510789) however, I should not resent being denied the usual privileges that go with membership of a community but ought to continue doing my duty by it.
('15', 258, 2, 23, 510934) The caste system has other laws besides those relating to eating and marriage.
('15', 258, 2, 24, 511013) It has, ready at hand, the means for providing primary education.
('15', 258, 2, 25, 511079) Every community can make its own arrangements for [such] education.
('15', 258, 2, 26, 511147) It has machinery for election to the Swaraj Sabha

('15', 259, 1, 3, 511334) Every community with some standing may elect its own representatives.
('15', 259, 1, 4, 511404) It has ready provision for arbitration and tribunals to solve disputes.
('15', 259, 1, 5, 511476) Each community should itself resolve disputes among its own members.
('15', 259, 1, 6, 511545) If it becomes necessary to raise an army for war, we have already as many battalions as we have communities.
('15', 259, 1, 7, 511654) The caste system has struck such deep roots in India that I think it will be far more advisable to try to improve it, rather than uproot it.
('15', 259, 1, 8, 511795) Some may argue that, if these views about the caste system are right, one will have to admit that the more numerous the communities, the better it would be, and that, if that came about, every ten persons would form a community.
('15', 259, 1, 9, 512024) There is no substance in this argument.
('15', 259, 1, 10, 512064) The rise and disappearance of communities does not depend upon the will of particular individuals or groups.
('15', 259, 1, 11, 512173) In Hindu society, communities have been formed, have disappeared and have gone through improvements according to the needs of the times and the process is taking place even today, visibly or invisibly.
('15', 259, 1, 12, 512375) The Hindu caste system is not merely an inert, lifeless institution but a living one and has been functioning according to its own law.
('15', 259, 1, 13, 512511) Unfortunately, today we find it full of evils like ostentation and hypocrisy, pleasure seeking and quarrels.
('15', 259, 1, 14, 512620) But this only proves that people lack character; we cannot conclude from it that the system itself is bad.

('15', 260, 3, 4, 513359) I am grateful to the Reception Committee for giving me this privilege of proposing the election of the President today.
('15', 260, 3, 5, 513479) When I was in Delhi some days ago, I happened to read a Persian couplet in the beautiful Divan e Am and Divan e Khas there 2. The couplet means ; If there is a paradise anywhere on this earth, it is here, it is here, it is here. The thoughts which the couplet aroused in me then revive in my mind as I move this proposal.
('15', 260, 3, 6, 513801) The words proceeded from the pride of kingly power and wealth.
('15', 260, 3, 7, 513864) There can be no such paradise on this earth, because in the course of time even that place is bound to be destroyed.
('15', 260, 3, 8, 513981) If, however, we turn to good use this occasion of our meeting, we may some time get into the paradise that is invisible.
('15', 260, 3, 9, 514102) It is a matter of no little pride for us that moderate and extremist leaders have met together today.
('15', 260, 3, 10, 514204) India is a country situated in the temperate zone.
('15', 260, 3, 11, 514255) We desire that this conference should give birth to a temperate party which would secure for us all that we demand.
('15', 260, 3, 12, 514371) Ahmedabad is a commercial city and it is but natural that its business acumen should be manifest in every undertaking.
('15', 260, 3, 13, 514490) It has chosen as President a person who holds a respected position in the eyes of both parties.
('15', 260, 3, 14, 514586) It decided accordingly that it would be in the fitness of things to elect as President a learned Muslim gentleman.
('15', 260, 3, 15, 514701) This is not for the first time that Ahmedabad has shown such wisdom.
('15', 260, 3, 16, 514770) It has done so on many previous occasions.
('15', 260, 3, 17, 514813) Our President, Mr. Jinnah, is an eminent lawyer; he is not only a member of the Legislature but also the President of the biggest Islamic Association in India.
('15', 260, 3, 18, 514973) He has placed us under a great obligation by accepting the presidentship of this small conference.
('15', 260, 3, 19, 515072) All of you must have rejoiced at it as much as I have done.
('15', 260, 3, 20, 515132) We should feel, in regard to all, that they belong to us.
('15', 260, 3, 21, 515190) The feeling which we outwardly show, that moderates or extermists, Surtis or Kathiawaris or Ahmedabadis, Hindus or Muslims, all are our brethren, should be there in our hearts, Muslims and others will then be so enslaved by our love that there will be no need to establish societies for the protection of animals.
('15', 260, 3, 22, 515504) Instead, our Muslim brethren

('15', 261, 1, 3, 515788) If we develop such feeling, this occasion, indeed the whole movement, will yield the expected result as a matter of course.
('15', 261, 1, 4, 515912) I know the Presidents job is like walking on the edge of a sword; let him utilize to the full the advantages he enjoys in virtue of the important position which he occupies.

('15', 261, 5, 9, 516267) October 22, 1916
('15', 261, 6, 10, 516284) At the Bombay Provincial Conference held in Ahmedabad, Gandhiji moved, on October 22, 1916, the following resolution:
('15', 261, 7, 11, 516402) That this Conference views with deep concern and alarm the working of the Defence of India Act as exemplified in the recent cases of Mrs. Besant and others and strongly urges upon Government the immediate necessity of providing in connection with the Defence of India Act the same safeguards as exist in England in relation to the Defence of the Realm Act.
('15', 261, 7, 12, 516759) It respectfully requests that Government may also be pleased to cancel at an early date the order prohibiting Mrs. Annie Besant from entering the limits of this Presidency.
('15', 261, 8, 13, 516932) Speaking in Gujarati, Mr. Gandhi said he thought the only thing Mrs. Besant seemed to have done was that she had been actively conducting the Home Rule agitation in India, and if that was the reason why the Bombay Government had prohibited her, then their late Viceroy Lord Hardinge was equally liable to be prohibited from entering the Presidency because it was His Lordship who had first raised this question.
('15', 261, 8, 14, 517344) Apart from that, there were three other grounds on which they should stand by Mrs. Besant, viz., gallantry, pity, and self interest.
('15', 261, 8, 15, 517477) Government had, as it were, laid its hands on a lady and, as a nation noted for chivalry, they should do all they could do to remove the indignity.
('15', 261, 8, 16, 517625) Then there was the question of pity.
('15', 261, 8, 17, 517662) They felt pity for Government because, with all its powers to bring the offending person to justice under the existing laws, it had found it necessary to resort to this measure against a lady.
('15', 261, 8, 18, 517855) Lastly, the question of self interest lay in the fact that they wanted Mrs. Besant in their Presidency because nobody could carry on the agitation better

('15', 262, 1, 2, 518051) than she.
('15', 262, 1, 3, 518061) The fact that no reason was given for the Government order was significant.
('15', 262, 1, 4, 518137) He warmly commended the resolution for acceptance.

('15', 263, 2, 3, 519668) October 23, 1916
('15', 263, 3, 4, 519685) On 23rd October, 1916, the third and concluding day of the Bombay Provincial Conference at Ahmedabad, Gandhiji moved the following resolution: That this Conference strongly urges the necessity of abolition of the indenture system as early as possible, the system being a form of slavery which socially and politically debases labourers and is seriously detrimental to the economic and moral interests of the country.
('15', 263, 4, 5, 520102) Mr. Gandhi, in moving the resolution, spoke in Gujarati explaining the various difficulties existing at present.

('15', 263, 8, 9, 520306) Gandhiji moved the following resolution: This Conference brings to the special notice of Government the inconvenience, hardship and annoyance caused to persons coming from Kathiawar into British territory by levy of customs duties and especially by the stringency of the rules and the manner of their enforcement for such levy at the Viramgam Railway station and at other stations which border on Gujarat and earnestly prays for the removal of the levy at an early date.
('15', 263, 9, 10, 520777) Moving the resolution, Gandhiji said: The people of Kathiawar are under the authority of two governments.
('15', 263, 9, 11, 520883) They are subjects of Indian Princes and the latter are subject to the authority of the British Government.
('15', 263, 9, 12, 520990) The idea behind the levy was to prevent the smuggling of goods from foreign countries.
('15', 263, 9, 13, 521077) Since arrangements for that purpose exist at the ports, why should the people have to bear this tax?

('15', 264, 5, 7, 521555) AHMEDABAD, November 1, 1916
('15', 264, 6, 8, 521583) DEAR MR. AJIT PRASAD,
('15', 264, 7, 9, 521605) I well remember having met you at Bombay.
('15', 264, 8, 10, 521647) I took action about Pandit Arjan Lal in the early part of the year but I understood then that the Government had positive proof in their possession of a damaging nature.
('15', 264, 8, 11, 521817) Since then I have become lukewarm.
('15', 264, 8, 12, 521852) I would like to discuss the matter further with you before taking further steps.
('15', 264, 8, 13, 521933) I know the argument that we ask not for an unconditional discharge but for a proper trial.
('15', 264, 8, 14, 522024) The most effective appeal can however be based only on real innocence of the party concerned.
('15', 264, 8, 15, 522118) If I come to Lucknow during the Congress meet, we shall discuss the whole matter.

('15', 265, 7, 12, 522761) November 9, 1916
('15', 265, 8, 13, 522778) Shrimad [Rajchandra] led his life in a spirit of the highest detachment.
('15', 265, 8, 14, 522851) There are two classes of people in this meeting.
('15', 265, 8, 15, 522900) In one class are those who look upon Shrimad Rajchandra with a feeling of devotion; and in the other those who are here only as spectators at a show.
('15', 265, 8, 16, 523050) Whether or not this jayanti will be successfully celebrated depends essentially on the former.
('15', 265, 8, 17, 523145) Those who revere Shrimad should show this reverence in their own dealings.
('15', 265, 8, 18, 523220) If the followers of Shrimad show themselves virtuous in their behaviour, that would have a great effect on society.
('15', 265, 8, 19, 523336) Religion rests on conduct.
('15', 265, 8, 20, 523363) If you can improve your manner of living, you will be able to improve society.
('15', 265, 8, 21, 523442) Shrimad has had a profound influence on me.
('15', 265, 8, 22, 523486) I would, therefore, say to his followers that Shrimads name is in their hands.
('15', 265, 8, 23, 523565) They should emulate, in the right spirit, the ideals and the conduct of Shrimad.
('15', 265, 8, 24, 523646) Otherwise, an element of hypocrisy will creep into such jayanti celebrations.
('15', 265, 8, 25, 523724) Strive as much as you can to avoid being hypocritical.
('15', 265, 8, 26, 523779) If there is a true feeling of devotion in them, those who are here as mere spectators will go back infected by it.

('15', 266, 7, 12, 524455) That there has been loss in your affairs is no virtue of yours.
('15', 266, 7, 13, 524519) You would have prevented the loss if you could have.
('15', 266, 7, 14, 524572) I appreciate your anxiety to be and feel totally independent before you can live in comfort with me.
('15', 266, 7, 15, 524673) All I say is when the agony of the war is over, you will first hasten here and then arrange your programme.

('15', 267, 6, 8, 525792) I am making experiments but they do not answer completely.
('15', 267, 6, 9, 525851) The slightest indulgence tells upon the boys.

('15', 267, 6, 14, 526130) This illness taxes me much.
('15', 267, 6, 15, 526158) The introduction of the Pariah family had already put an undue strain on me and now comes the sickness.
('15', 267, 6, 16, 526262) However we make merry and go on.
('15', 267, 6, 17, 526295) Only I should like you to be with me on such occasions.

('15', 268, 5, 10, 527320) 1 I am sure you will not have when we come to the end of it all.
('15', 268, 5, 11, 527385) You have never wanted to live an aimless and selfish life.
('15', 268, 5, 12, 527444) Those who want to find happiness in realizing essential oneness of all life, as I know you do, cannot fail to gain a great deal from the experiences such as you are having.
('15', 268, 5, 13, 527617) Anyway all you learnt is now being tested in a manner least expected by you or me.
('15', 268, 5, 14, 527700) But do not worry over your South African affairs.
('15', 268, 5, 15, 527750) It will be time to do so when the war is over.
('15', 268, 5, 16, 527797) Your next few letters will now be my special care.
('15', 268, 5, 17, 527848) Remember Lead Kindly Light.
('15', 268, 5, 18, 527876) Lay stress upon one step enough for me.
('15', 268, 5, 19, 527916) It is not given to us to peep into the future.
('15', 268, 5, 20, 527963) If we but take care of the present, the future will take care of itself.
('15', 268, 6, 21, 528036) All but Polak, a member, and I have gone a picknicking today.
('15', 268, 6, 22, 528098) It is a Sunday and it is at the present moment about 4 p.m.
('15', 268, 6, 23, 528158) This is our winter season and the weather is superb.
('15', 268, 6, 24, 528211) This is just the time of the year when one could walk out for the whole day.
('15', 268, 7, 25, 528288) With love from us all,
('15', 268, 8, 26, 528311) Yours always, OLD FRIEND

('15', 269, 1, 2, 528517) 206. LETTER TO A. H. WEST
('15', 269, 2, 3, 528543) AHMEDABAD, December 12, 1916
('15', 269, 3, 4, 528572) MY DEAR WEST, This is not the draft letter that Polak refers to in his letter to you herewith.
('15', 269, 3, 5, 528667) But what I am now saying is in substance what is in the draft letter.
('15', 269, 3, 6, 528737) We have all thought over your proposal and feel that we can no longer rely upon support from the P. R. fund.
('15', 269, 3, 7, 528846) The Phoenix trustees are not all agreed upon the support being so received.
('15', 269, 3, 8, 528922) The Committee here will at the most just tolerate the withdrawal of fund[s] for sustaining Indian Opinion.
('15', 269, 3, 9, 529029) And the public there will also look upon such support with strong disfavour.
('15', 269, 3, 10, 529106) In the circumstances, we can only fall back upon local support or failing that reduce the paper to any extent we choose.
('15', 269, 3, 11, 529227) In this matter you should have absolute control.
('15', 269, 3, 12, 529276) By you, I mean you, Devi 1 and Sam 2 and anyone who may be sent from here.
('15', 269, 3, 13, 529351) I observe that Pragji must now leave.
('15', 269, 3, 14, 529389) He wants to.
('15', 269, 3, 15, 529402) Bhaga too goes.
('15', 269, 3, 16, 529418) Chhaganlal is ready to come over and work under you loyally.
('15', 269, 3, 17, 529479) Or if you will not shoulder the responsibility, he will work the paper with your loyal co operation.
('15', 269, 3, 18, 529580) I do hope you will agree to Chhaganlals return.
('15', 269, 3, 19, 529628) If you dont, Chhaganlal will come with his family to work on the same terms as above.
('15', 269, 3, 20, 529714) And if you do not favour Maganlals return, Manilal and Ramdas can be sent.
('15', 269, 3, 21, 529789) They of course can only work under your directions.
('15', 269, 3, 22, 529841) Manilal should find no difficulty in gradually editing the Gujarati part.
('15', 269, 3, 23, 529915) For the time being, he will simply translate what you want him to.
('15', 269, 3, 24, 529982) If you favour Chhaganlals return, cable simply Chhaganlal and I shall know.
('15', 269, 3, 25, 530058) If you want Maganlal, cable simply Maganlal.
('15', 269, 3, 26, 530103) And if you want Manilal and Ramdas, cable simply Manilal.
('15', 269, 3, 27, 530161) If you want only Manilal, you may cable Manilal without Ramdas.
('15', 269, 3, 28, 530225) I shall write later about the accounts.
('15', 269, 3, 29, 530265) We do not need to publish
('15', 269, 4, 30, 530291) 1 The addressees sister, Ada West; Devi was the Indian name given to her by Gandhiji.

('15', 270, 1, 2, 530523) them now.
('15', 270, 1, 3, 530533) I have only to inform Mr. Petit how we propose to deal with the balance.
('15', 270, 1, 4, 530606) Transvaal Indian Womens Association funds are not with me.
('15', 270, 1, 5, 530665) They are in the balance with you.
('15', 270, 1, 6, 530699) Even if you disagree, you should bank the amount due separately in consultation with Miss Schlesin and hand the receipt to her.
('15', 270, 1, 7, 530827) They want it banked to bear interest.
('15', 270, 1, 8, 530865) And they are right.
('15', 270, 1, 9, 530885) Polak has gone to Madras.
('15', 270, 1, 10, 530911) I am preparing for the Congress.
('15', 270, 1, 11, 530944) I want to write on many matters, not about the press or Phoenix.
('15', 270, 1, 12, 531009) But this must wait till after my return from Lucknow.
('15', 270, 1, 13, 531063) I wrote 1 to Pragji when he told me that you all did not want Chhaganlal, that I would not send him.
('15', 270, 1, 14, 531164) So said Polak too.
('15', 270, 1, 15, 531183) But after consultation with Chhaganlal and examining the situation here, I came to the conclusion that I must at least let you know it and let you decide one way or the other.
('15', 270, 1, 16, 531359) With love to you all,
('15', 270, 2, 17, 531381) Yours sincerely,

('15', 270, 7, 22, 531546) AHMEDABAD, December 17, 1916
('15', 270, 8, 23, 531575) MY DEAR FRIEND, I have two letters from you together.
('15', 270, 8, 24, 531629) I hope that by the time this reaches you, uncertainty about your fate will have vanished and that you would feel settled so far as it is possible to feel like that in these times.
('15', 270, 8, 25, 531809) You have added up your gains and losses.
('15', 270, 8, 26, 531850) It is a difficult task.
('15', 270, 8, 27, 531874) We often deceive ourselves and what may appear to be losses may be gains in reality and vice versa.
('15', 270, 8, 28, 531974) The measure of progress is the measure of resistance to temptations.
('15', 270, 8, 29, 532043) The world may judge us by a single fall.
('15', 270, 8, 30, 532084) But we might in spite thereof have risen if we have resisted numerous temptations previous to the fall and after the fall we are conscious of it and sincerely desirous of retracing the steps.
('15', 270, 8, 31, 532276) To count losses and

('15', 271, 1, 2, 532370) gains therefore is not an easy matter by any means.
('15', 271, 2, 3, 532422) Dr. Mehta has been here for a few days.
('15', 271, 2, 4, 532462) Polak is returning tomorrow from Madras.
('15', 271, 2, 5, 532503) Manilal and Ramdas will be soon with me, as they will be going to South Africa to help West.
('15', 271, 2, 6, 532596) I think I have already informed you of this move.
('15', 271, 2, 7, 532646) Of the four boys I shall therefore have only Devdas.
('15', 271, 2, 8, 532699) With best love,

('15', 271, 6, 13, 532881) December 22, 1916
('15', 271, 7, 14, 532899) Mr. M. K. Gandhi delivered an instructive lecture on Does economic progress clash with real progress? at a meeting of the Muir Central College Economic Society held on Friday evening in the physical science theatre.
('15', 271, 7, 15, 533115) The Hon.
('15', 271, 7, 16, 533124) Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya presided.
('15', 271, 7, 17, 533162) There was a good gathering of ladies and gentlemen, European and Indian, besides a large number of students.
('15', 271, 7, 18, 533271) Among those present were Dr. E. G. Hill, the Hon.
('15', 271, 7, 19, 533321) Dr. Sundar Lal, the Hon.

('15', 271, 8, 31, 533700) 1 Amaranatha Jhas Diary has the following entries: December 22, 1916 From 3 to 5 stayed at Malaviyajis house, talking to Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Polak.
('15', 271, 8, 32, 533847) Then to the college physics theatre where Mr. Gandhi read his paper before the Economic Society.
('15', 271, 8, 33, 533944) I took his paper from him which was written on sheets on which was printed his South African address, Tolstoy Farm, Johannesburg.
('15', 271, 8, 34, 534074) He asked me to request Mr. Chintamani [Editor, The Leader] to send to him the proofs for correction December 23, 1916 From 11 to 4 stayed at Malaviyajis house, talking to Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Polak, Ramdas Gandhi, Mr. Medh (who has been several times to jail for passive resistance).
('15', 271, 8, 35, 534356) Mr. Chintamani sent the proofs of Mr. Gandhis lecture for correction.
('15', 271, 8, 36, 534426) I asked for and obtained from Mr. Gandhi the original manuscript.
('15', 271, 8, 37, 534492) He said, This lecture is worthier of the waste paper basket than your desk. Amaranatha Jha: A Memorial Volume, Ed.

('15', 272, 2, 8, 534961) Pandit Malaviya to the chair and welcomed Mr. Gandhi in their midst.
('15', 272, 3, 9, 535030) The Hon.
('15', 272, 3, 10, 535039) Pandit Malaviya in introducing Mr. Gandhi said that his was a name honoured throughout India and wherever Indians lived.
('15', 272, 3, 11, 535160) His name was also appreciated by a large number of Europeans who understood his character.
('15', 272, 3, 12, 535251) It was always an instruction to him to read of the work he had done and of the life he had led.
('15', 272, 4, 13, 535347) Mr. Gandhi then delivered the following lecture: When I accepted Mr. Kapildeva Malaviyas invitation to speak to you upon the subject of this evening, I was painfully conscious of my limitations.
('15', 272, 4, 14, 535542) You are an economic society.
('15', 272, 4, 15, 535571) You have chosen distinguished specialists for the subjects included in your syllabus for this year and the next.
('15', 272, 4, 16, 535684) I seem to be the only speaker ill fitted for the task set before him.
('15', 272, 4, 17, 535754) Frankly and truly, I know very little of economics, as you naturally understand them.
('15', 272, 4, 18, 535840) Only the other day, sitting at an evening meal, a civilian friend deluged me with a series of questions on my crankisms.
('15', 272, 4, 19, 535961) As he proceeded in his cross examination, I being a willing victim, he found no difficulty in discovering my gross ignorance of the matters.
('15', 272, 4, 20, 536102) I appeared to him to be handling with a cocksureness worthy only of a man who knows not that he knows not.
('15', 272, 4, 21, 536209) To his horror and even indignation, I suppose, he found that I had not even read books on economics by such well known authorities as Mill, Marshall, Adam Smith and a host of such other authors.
('15', 272, 4, 22, 536404) In despair, he ended by advising me to read these works before experimenting in matters economic at the expense of the public.
('15', 272, 4, 23, 536531) He little knew that I was a sinner past redemption.
('15', 272, 4, 24, 536583) My experiments continue at the expense of trusting friends.
('15', 272, 4, 25, 536643) For, there come to us moments in life when about some things we need no proof from without.
('15', 272, 4, 26, 536735) A little voice within us tells us, You are on the right track, move neither to your left nor right, but keep to the straight and narrow way. With such help we march forward slowly indeed, but surely and steadily.
('15', 272, 4, 27, 536948) That is my position.
('15', 272, 4, 28, 536969) It may be satisfactory enough for me, but it can in no way answer the requirements of a society such as yours.
('15', 272, 4, 29, 537080) Still it was no use my struggling against Mr. Kapildeva Malaviya.
('15', 272, 4, 30, 537146) I knew that he was intent upon having me to engage your attention for one of your
('15', 273, 0, 1, 537228) 274 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 273, 1, 2, 537270) evenings.
('15', 273, 1, 3, 537280) Perhaps you will treat my intrusion as a welcome diversion from the trodden path.
('15', 273, 1, 4, 537362) An occasional fast after a series of sumptuous feasts is often a necessity.
('15', 273, 1, 5, 537438) And as with the body, so, I imagine, is the case with the reason.
('15', 273, 1, 6, 537504) And if your reason this evening is found fasting instead of feasting, I am sure it will enjoy with the greater avidity the feast that Rao Bahadur Pandit Chandrika Prasad has in store for you for the 12th of January.
('15', 273, 2, 7, 537720) Before I take you to the field of my experiences and experiments, it is perhaps best to have a mutual understanding about the title of this evenings address: Does economic progress clash with real progress?
('15', 273, 2, 8, 537927) By economic progress, I take it, we mean material advancement without limit and by real progress we mean moral progress, which again is the same thing as progress of the permanent element in us.
('15', 273, 2, 9, 538122) The subject may therefore be stated thus: Does not moral progress increase in the same proportion as material progress? I know that this is a wider proposition than the one before us.
('15', 273, 2, 10, 538306) But I venture to think that we always mean the larger one even when we lay down the smaller.
('15', 273, 2, 11, 538399) For we know enough of science to realise that there is no such thing as perfect rest or repose in this visible universe of ours.
('15', 273, 2, 12, 538528) If therefore material progress does not clash with moral progress, it must necessarily advance the latter.
('15', 273, 2, 13, 538635) Nor can we be satisfied with the clumsy way in which sometimes those who cannot defend the larger proposition put their case.
('15', 273, 2, 14, 538761) They seem to be obsessed with the concrete case of thirty millions of India stated by the late Sir William Wilson Hunter to be living on one meal a day.
('15', 273, 2, 15, 538914) They say that before we can think or talk of their moral welfare, we must satisfy their daily wants.
('15', 273, 2, 16, 539015) With these, they say, material progress spells moral progress.
('15', 273, 2, 17, 539078) And then is taken a sudden jump: what is true of thirty millions is true of the universe.
('15', 273, 2, 18, 539168) They forget that hard cases make bad law.
('15', 273, 2, 19, 539210) I need hardly say to you how ludicrously absurd this deduction would be.
('15', 273, 2, 20, 539283) No one has ever suggested that grinding pauperism can lead to anything else than moral degradation.
('15', 273, 2, 21, 539383) Every human being has a right to live and therefore to find the wherewithal to feed himself and where necessary to clothe and house himself.
('15', 273, 2, 22, 539524) But, for this very simple performance, we need no assistance from economists or their laws.
('15', 273, 3, 23, 539616) Take no thought for the morrow 1 is an injuction which finds an echo in almost all the religious scriptures of the world.

('15', 274, 1, 2, 539802) well ordered society, the securing of ones livelihood should be and is found to be the easiest thing in the world.
('15', 274, 1, 3, 539917) Indeed, the test of orderliness in a country is not the number of millionaires it owns, but the absence of starvation among its masses.
('15', 274, 1, 4, 540053) The only statement that has to be examined is whether it can be laid down as a law of universal application that material advancement means moral progress.
('15', 274, 2, 5, 540209) Now let us take a few illustrations.
('15', 274, 2, 6, 540246) Rome suffered a moral fall when it attained high material affluence.
('15', 274, 2, 7, 540315) So did Egypt and so perhaps most countries of which we have any historic record.
('15', 274, 2, 8, 540396) The decendants, kinsmen of the royal and divine Krishna, too, fell when they were rolling in riches.
('15', 274, 2, 9, 540497) We do not deny to the Rockefellers and the Carnegies possession of an ordinary measure of morality but we gladly judge them indulgently.
('15', 274, 2, 10, 540634) I mean that we do not even expect them to satisfy the highest standard of morality.
('15', 274, 2, 11, 540718) With them material gain has not necessarily meant moral gain.
('15', 274, 2, 12, 540780) In South Africa, where I had the privilege of associating with thousands of our countrymen on most intimate terms, I observed almost invariably that the greater the possession of riches, the greater was their moral turpitude.
('15', 274, 2, 13, 541006) Our rich men, to say the least, did not advance the moral struggle of passive resistance as did the poor.
('15', 274, 2, 14, 541112) The rich mens sense of self respect was not so much injured as that of the poorest.
('15', 274, 2, 15, 541196) If I were not afraid of treading on dangerous ground, I would even come nearer home and show you that possession of riches has been a hindrance to real growth.
('15', 274, 2, 16, 541356) I venture to think that the scriptures of the world are far safer and sounder treatises on laws of economics than many of the modern text books.
('15', 274, 2, 17, 541501) The question we are asking ourselves this evening is not a new one.
('15', 274, 2, 18, 541569) It was addressed to Jesus two thousand years ago.
('15', 274, 2, 19, 541619) St. Mark 1
('15', 274, 3, 20, 541630) has vividly described the scene.
('15', 274, 3, 21, 541663) Jesus is in his solemn mood; he is earnest.
('15', 274, 3, 22, 541707) He talks of eternity.
('15', 274, 3, 23, 541729) He knows the world about him.
('15', 274, 3, 24, 541759) He is himself the greatest economist of his time.
('15', 274, 3, 25, 541809) He succeeded in economising time and spacehe transcended them.
('15', 274, 3, 26, 541872) It is to him at his best that one comes running, kneels down, and asks: Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life? And Jesus said unto him: Why callest thou me good?
('15', 274, 3, 27, 542057) There is none good but one, that is God.
('15', 274, 3, 28, 542098) Thou knowest the commandments.
('15', 274, 3, 29, 542129) Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother. And he answered and said unto him: Master, all these have I observed from my youth. Then Jesus

('15', 275, 0, 1, 542367) 276 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 275, 1, 2, 542409) beholding him, loved him and said unto him: One thing thou lackest.
('15', 275, 1, 3, 542477) Go thy way, sell whatever thou hast and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heavencome take up the cross and follow me. And he was sad at that saying and went away grievedfor he had great possessions.
('15', 275, 1, 4, 542692) And Jesus looked round about and said unto his disciples: How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God. And the disciples were astonished at his words.
('15', 275, 1, 5, 542868) But Jesus answereth again and saith unto them: Children, how hard it is for them that trust in riches to enter into the kindgom of God.
('15', 275, 1, 6, 543004) It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God ! Here you have an eternal rule of life stated in the noblest words the English language is capable of producing.
('15', 275, 1, 7, 543230) But the disciples nodded unbelief as we do even to this day.
('15', 275, 1, 8, 543291) To him they said as we say today: But look how the law fails in practice.
('15', 275, 1, 9, 543365) If we sell all and have nothing, we shall have nothing to eat.
('15', 275, 1, 10, 543428) We must have money or we cannot even be reasonably moral. So they state their case thus.
('15', 275, 1, 11, 543517) And they were astonished out of measure saying among themselves: Who then can be saved? And Jesus looking upon them saith: With men it is impossible but not with God, for with God all things are possible. Then Peter began to say unto him: Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee. And Jesus answered and said: Verily I say unto you there is no man that has left house or brethren or sisters; or father or mother, or wife or children or lands for my sake and the Gospels, but he shall receive one hundred fold, now in this time houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands with persecutions and in the world to come eternal life.
('15', 275, 1, 12, 544172) But many that are first shall be last and the last first. You have here the result or reward, if you prefer the term, of following the law.
('15', 275, 1, 13, 544312) I have not taken the trouble of copying similar passages from the other non Hindu scriptures and I will not insult you by quoting in support of the law stated by Jesus passages from the writings and sayings of our own sages, passages even stronger if possible than the Biblical extracts I have drawn your attention to.
('15', 275, 1, 14, 544631) Perhaps the strongest of all the testimonies in favour of the affirmative answer to the question before us are the lives of the greatest teachers of the world.
('15', 275, 1, 15, 544791) Jesus, Mahomed, Buddha, Nanak, Kabir, Chaitanya, Shankara, Dayanand, Ramakrishna were men who exercised an immense influence over and moulded the character of thousands of men.
('15', 275, 1, 16, 544968) The world is the richer for their having lived in it.
('15', 275, 1, 17, 545022) And they were all men who deliberately embraced poverty as their lot.
('15', 276, 0, 1, 545092) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 277
('15', 276, 1, 2, 545134) I should not have laboured my point as I have done, if I did not believe that, in so far as we have made the modern materialistic craze our goal, in so far are we going downhill in the path of progress.
('15', 276, 1, 3, 545337) I hold that economic progress in the sense I have put it is antagonistic to real progress.
('15', 276, 1, 4, 545428) Hence the ancient ideal has been the limitation of activities promoting wealth.
('15', 276, 1, 5, 545508) This does not put an end to all material ambition.
('15', 276, 1, 6, 545559) We should still have, as we have always had, in our midst people who make the pursuit of wealth their aim in life.
('15', 276, 1, 7, 545674) But we have always recognised that it is a fall from the ideal.
('15', 276, 1, 8, 545738) It is a beautiful thing to know that the wealthiest among us have often felt that to have remained voluntarily poor would have been a higher state for them.
('15', 276, 1, 9, 545895) That you cannot serve God and Mammon is an economic truth of the highest value.
('15', 276, 1, 10, 545975) We have to make our choice.
('15', 276, 1, 11, 546003) Western nations today are groaning under the heel of the monster god of materialism.
('15', 276, 1, 12, 546088) Their moral growth has become stunted.
('15', 276, 1, 13, 546127) They measure their progress in .
('15', 276, 1, 14, 546160) American wealth has become the standard.
('15', 276, 1, 15, 546201) She [sic] is the envy of the other nations.
('15', 276, 1, 16, 546245) I have heard many of our countrymen say that we will gain American wealth but avoid its methods.
('15', 276, 1, 17, 546342) I venture to suggest that such an attempt if it were made is foredoomed to failure.
('15', 276, 1, 18, 546426) We cannot be wise, temperate and furious 1 in a moment.
('15', 276, 1, 19, 546482) I would have our leaders to teach us to be morally supreme in the world.
('15', 276, 1, 20, 546555) This land of ours was once, we are told, the abode of the gods.
('15', 276, 1, 21, 546619) It is not possible to conceive gods inhabiting a land which is made hideous by the smoke and the din of null chimneys and factories and whose roadways are traversed by rushing engines dragging numerous cars crowded with men mostly who know not what they are after, who are often absent minded, and whose tempers do not improve by being uncomfortably packed like sardines in boxes and finding themselves in the midst of utter strangers who would oust them if they could and whom they would in their turn oust similarly.
('15', 276, 1, 22, 547138) I refer to these things because they are held to be symbolical of material progress.
('15', 276, 1, 23, 547223) But they add not an atom to our happiness.
('15', 276, 1, 24, 547266) This is what Wallace, the great scientist, has said as his deliberate Judgement.
('15', 276, 2, 25, 547347) In the earliest records which have come down to us from the past, we find ample indications that general ethical considerations and conceptions, the accepted standard of morality, and the conduct resulting from these were in no degree inferior to those which prevail to day.

('15', 277, 0, 1, 547730) 278 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 277, 1, 2, 547772) In a series of chapters, he then proceeds to examine the position of the English nation under the advance in wealth it has made.
('15', 277, 1, 3, 547901) He says:
('15', 277, 2, 4, 547910) This rapid growth of wealth and increase of our power over nature put too great a strain upon our crude civilization, on our superficial Christianity, and it was accompanied by various forms of social immorality almost as amazing and unprecedented.
('15', 277, 2, 5, 548159) He then shows how factories have risen on the corpses of men, women and children, how as the country has rapidly advanced in riches, it has gone down in morality.
('15', 277, 2, 6, 548322) He shows this by dealing with insanitation, life destroying trades, adulteration, bribery and gambling.
('15', 277, 2, 7, 548426) He shows how, with the advance of wealth, justice has become immoral, deaths from alcoholism and suicide have increased.
('15', 277, 2, 8, 548547) the average of premature births and congenital defects has increased, and prostitution has become an institution.
('15', 277, 2, 9, 548661) He concludes his examination by these pregnant remarks:
('15', 277, 3, 10, 548717) The proceedings of the divorce courts show other aspects of the result of wealth and leisure, while a friend who had been good deal inLondon society assured me that both in country houses and in London various kinds of orgies were occasionally to be met with which would hardly have been surpassed in the period of the most dissolute emperors.
('15', 277, 3, 11, 549061) Of war, too, I need say nothing.
('15', 277, 3, 12, 549094) It has always been more or less chronic since the rise of the Roman Empire; but there is now undoubtedly a disinclination for war among all civilized peoples.
('15', 277, 3, 13, 549253) Yet the vast burden of armaments, taken together with the most pious declarations in favour of peace, must be held to show an almost total absence of morality as a guiding principle among the governing classes.
('15', 277, 3, 14, 549464) Under the British aegis, we have learnt much, but it is my firm belief that there is little to gain from Britain in intrinsic morality, that if we are not careful, we shall introduce all the vices that she has been a prey to, owing to the disease of materialism.
('15', 277, 3, 15, 549727) We can profit by that connection only if we keep our civilization, and our morals, straight, i.e., if instead of boasting of the glorious past, we express the ancient moral glory in our own lives and let our lives bear witness to our past.
('15', 277, 3, 16, 549967) Then we shall benefit her and ourselves.
('15', 277, 3, 17, 550008) If we copy her because she provides us with rulers, both they and we shall suffer degradation.
('15', 277, 3, 18, 550103) We need not be afraid of ideals or of reducing them to practice even to the uttermost.
('15', 277, 3, 19, 550190) Ours will only then be a truly spiritual nation when we shall show more truth than gold, greater fearlessness than pomp of power and wealth, greater charity than love of self.
('15', 277, 3, 20, 550366) If we will but clean

('15', 278, 1, 2, 550429) town houses, our palaces and temples of the attributes of wealth and show in them the attributes of morality, we can offer battle to any combinations of hostile forces without having to carry the burden of a heavy militia.
('15', 278, 1, 3, 550652) Let us seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and the irrevocable promise is that everything will be added with us.
('15', 278, 1, 4, 550781) These are real economics.
('15', 278, 1, 5, 550807) May you and I treasure them and enforce them in our daily life.
('15', 278, 2, 6, 550871) An interesting discussion followed in the course of which several students put questions to the lecturer.
('15', 278, 3, 7, 550977) Jevons said .
('15', 278, 3, 8, 550991) It was necessary for economists to exist.
('15', 278, 3, 9, 551033) It was not their business to lay down what the end should be.
('15', 278, 3, 10, 551095) That was the business of philosophers.
('15', 278, 4, 11, 551134) Gidwani, president of the society, thanked the lecturer for his address.
('15', 278, 5, 12, 551207) Higginbottom said that there was no economic problem which could be separated from the moral problem.
('15', 278, 6, 13, 551309) Mr. Gandhi in the course of his remarks referred to Mr. Jevons remark about the need for economist and said that it was said that dirt was matter misplaced.
('15', 278, 6, 14, 551466) So also when an economist was misplaced, he was hurtful.
('15', 278, 6, 15, 551523) He certainly thought that the economist had a place in the economy of nature when he occupied the humble sphere for which he was created.
('15', 278, 6, 16, 551661) If an economist did not investigate the laws of God and show them how to distribute wealth so that there might not be poverty, he was a most unwelcome intrusion on the Indian soil.
('15', 278, 6, 17, 551842) He would also suggest for the reflection of their economic students and professors that what might be good for England and America need not necessarily be good for India.
('15', 278, 6, 18, 552013) He thought that most of the economic laws which were consistent with moral laws were of universal application, but there might be in their restricted application some distinction and difference.
('15', 278, 6, 19, 552208) So he would utter the note of warning that Indian conditions being in some respects so essentially different from the English and American conditions, it was necessary to bring to bear on the matters that presented themselves to the economists a fresh mind.
('15', 278, 6, 20, 552466) If they did so, both Indians and the economists would derive benefit.
('15', 278, 6, 21, 552536) Mr. Higginbottom, he said, was studying the real economics that were so necessary for India and reducing his studies inch by inch to practice and that was the safest guide to follow, whether they were students or professors.
('15', 278, 6, 22, 552761) Referring to a question by a student, he said that a man should not hoard money for selfish ends, but if he wished to hoard money as a trustee for the millions of India, he would say that he might have as much riches as he could.
('15', 278, 6, 23, 552991) Ordinarily, economists prescribed laws for the rich people.
('15', 278, 6, 24, 553051) It was against those economists that he would always cry out.
('15', 278, 7, 25, 553113) As regards another question, whether factories should not be replaced by
('15', 279, 0, 1, 553186) 280 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 279, 1, 2, 553228) cottage industries, Mr. Gandhi spoke approvingly of the suggestion but said that the economists should first of all examine with patience their indigenous institutions.
('15', 279, 1, 3, 553397) If they were rotten, they must be wiped but and if there were remedies which could be suggested for their betterment, they should improve them.
('15', 279, 2, 4, 553541) As regards intercourse with other nations, he said that he did not think that they necessarily advanced one little bit in their moral growth by bringing their masses with others into physical contact and pointed to Indians in South Africa as an instance.
('15', 279, 2, 5, 553796) The rapid locomotion such as steamers, trains and others dislocated so many of their ideals and created a great deal of mischief.
('15', 279, 3, 6, 553926) As regards the question what was the minimum and the maximum wealth a man should havehe would answer in the words of Jesus, Ramkrishna and others who said none.
('15', 279, 4, 7, 554087) The Hon.
('15', 279, 4, 8, 554096) Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya in his concluding remarks offered a cordial vote of thanks to Mr. Gandhi for his excellent address.
('15', 279, 4, 9, 554224) The ideals which Mr. Gandhi put before them, he said, were so high that he did not expect that all of them would be prepared to subscribe to all of them.
('15', 279, 4, 10, 554378) But he was sure they would agree with the main object he put before them, namely, that they should go for the welfare of man as the test of all economic questions with which they dealt.

('15', 279, 6, 12, 554587) 209. SPEECH AT ALLAHABAD ON EDUCATION, ANCIENT AND MODERN
('15', 279, 7, 13, 554645) December 23, 1916
('15', 279, 8, 14, 554663) Mr. Gandhi addressed in Hindi a public meeting at Allahabad at Munshi Ram Prasads garden under the chairmanship of the Hon.
('15', 279, 8, 15, 554787) Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya.
('15', 279, 8, 16, 554816) The gathering was a record one even for Munshi Ram Prasads garden where some of the largest public meetings have been held.
('15', 279, 9, 17, 554940) Mr. Gandhi, who on rising was greeted with loud and prolonged cheers, said that that he should have felt difficultyof which he was ashamedin addressing the meeting in Hindi, was a striking commentary on the system of modern education which was a part of the subject of his lecture that evening.
('15', 279, 9, 18, 555235) He would, however, prefer to speak in Hindi although he had greater facility of expression in English.
('15', 279, 9, 19, 555338) Describing the modern system of education, he said that real education was considered to have begun at the college at the age of 16 or 17. The education received in school was not useful.
('15', 279, 9, 20, 555526) For instance, an Indian student, while he knew well the geography of England, did not possess a sufficient knowledge of the geography of his own country.
('15', 279, 9, 21, 555680) This history of India which they were taught was greatly distorted.
('15', 279, 9, 22, 555748) Government

('15', 280, 1, 2, 555801) service was the aim of their education.
('15', 280, 1, 3, 555841) Their highest ambition was to become members of the Imperial Legislative Council.
('15', 280, 1, 4, 555923) The boys abandoned their hereditary occupations, and forsook their mother tongue.
('15', 280, 1, 5, 556005) They were adopting the English language, European ideas and European dress.
('15', 280, 1, 6, 556081) They thought in English, conducted all their political and social work and all commercial transactions, etc., in English and thought that they could not do without the English language.
('15', 280, 1, 7, 556267) They had come to think that there was no other road.
('15', 280, 1, 8, 556320) Education through English had created a wide gulf between the educated few and the masses.
('15', 280, 1, 9, 556411) It had created a gulf in the families also.
('15', 280, 1, 10, 556455) An English educated man had no community of feelings and ideas with the ladies of his family.
('15', 280, 1, 11, 556549) And, as had been said, the aspirations of the English educated men were fixed on Government service and at the most on membership of the Imperial Legislative Council.
('15', 280, 1, 12, 556716) He for one could never commend a system of education which produced such a state of things and men educated under such system could not be expected to do any great service to the country.
('15', 280, 1, 13, 556904) Mr. Gandhi did not mean that the English educated leaders did not feel for the masses.
('15', 280, 1, 14, 556991) On the other hand, he acknowledged that the Congress and other great public movements were initiated and conducted by them.
('15', 280, 1, 15, 557115) But, at the same time, he could not help feeling that the work done during all these years would have been much more and much greater progress would have been made if they had been taught in their mother tongue.
('15', 280, 1, 16, 557327) It was unfortunate, said the speaker, that a feeling had come over them that there was no path to progress other than that which I was being followed.
('15', 280, 1, 17, 557478) They found themselves helpless.
('15', 280, 1, 18, 557510) But it was not manliness to assume all attitude of helplessness.
('15', 280, 2, 19, 557575) Mr. Gandhi then described the ancient system of education and said that even elementary education imparted by the village teacher taught the student all that was necessary for their occupations.
('15', 280, 2, 20, 557770) Those who went in for higher education became fully conversant with the science of wealth, Artha Shastra, ethics and religion, Dharma Shastra.
('15', 280, 2, 21, 557913) In ancient times, there were no restrictions on education.
('15', 280, 2, 22, 557972) It was not
('15', 280, 3, 23, 557983) controlled by the State but was solely in the hands of the Brahmins who shaped the system of education solely with an eye to the welfare of the people.
('15', 280, 3, 24, 558135) It was based on restraint and brahmacharya.
('15', 280, 3, 25, 558179) It was due to such a system of education that Indian
('15', 280, 4, 26, 558232) civilization had outlived so many vicissitudes through thousands of years, while such ancient civilizations as those of Greece, Rome and Egypt had become extinct.
('15', 280, 4, 27, 558395) No doubt the wave of a new civilization had been passing through India.
('15', 280, 4, 28, 558467) But he was sure that it was transitory, it would soon pass away and Indian civilization would be revivified.
('15', 280, 4, 29, 558576) In ancient times, the basis of life was self restraint but now it was enjoyment.
('15', 280, 4, 30, 558657) The result was that people had become powerless cowards and forsook the truth.
('15', 280, 4, 31, 558736) Having come under the influence of another civilization, it might be necessary to adapt our own civilization in certain respects to our new environment but we should not make any radical change in a civilization which was acknowledged even by some western scholars to be the best.
('15', 280, 4, 32, 559017) It might be urged that it was necessary to
('15', 281, 0, 1, 559060) 282 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 281, 1, 2, 559102) adopt the methods and instruments of western civilization to meet the material forces of that civilization.
('15', 281, 1, 3, 559210) But the forces born of spirituality, the bedrock of Indian civilization, were more than a match for material forces.
('15', 281, 1, 4, 559327) India was pre eminently the land of religion.
('15', 281, 1, 5, 559373) It was the first and the last duty of Indians to maintain it as such.
('15', 281, 1, 6, 559443) They should draw their strength from the soul, from God.
('15', 281, 1, 7, 559500) If they adhered to that path, swarajya which they were aspiring to and working for would become their handmaid.

('15', 281, 5, 10, 559720) December 28, 1916
('15', 281, 6, 11, 559738) Mr. M. K. Gandhi (Bombay) moving Resolution No.
('15', 281, 6, 12, 559786) IX on Indentured Labour on 28th December 1916 at the 31st Indian National Congress Session held at Lucknow said:
('15', 281, 7, 13, 559899) MR. PRESIDENT, BROTHER DELEGATES, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I notice that there is an appeal made to me by my Tamil brethren that I should speak to them in English and I am going partly to accede to their importunity, but I want to make an appeal in return that during the next year if they do not learn the lingua franca, which I know will be the lingua franca (Hear, hear), when swaraj is granted to the whole of India, if you do not do so during the ensuing year, you will do so at your peril, so far as I am concerned.
('15', 281, 7, 14, 560418) (Cheers.) I shall read the resolution in English, which I propose to read afterwards in Hindi also.
('15', 281, 7, 15, 560518) The resolution runs as follows: (a) This Congress strongly urges that indentured emigration should be stopped by prohibiting the recruitment of such labour within the ensuing year.
('15', 281, 7, 16, 560699) (b) In the opinion of this Congress, it is highly desirable that at least one representative Indian selected after consultation with associations voicing Indian public opinion be appointed by the Government of India to take part in the forthcoming inter departmental Conference to be held in London for the consideration of this question.
('15', 281, 7, 17, 561038) (c) This Congress earnestly requests that the reports of Mr. Marjoribanks and Honble Mr. Thambi Marakkyar and of the inter departmental Committee be published for general
('15', 282, 0, 1, 561209) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 283
('15', 282, 1, 2, 561251) information and discussion before any action is taken thereupon.
('15', 282, 1, 3, 561316) The pressmen and the delegates who have copies of the resolution with them will kindly note that there is a verbal alteration in clause (a), that instead of the word during, the resolution will read within.
('15', 282, 1, 4, 561523) It is made at the instance of a friend who is afraid that the Government might consider that we would be satisfied if indentured emigration was suspended during the ensuing year, whereas our meaning is that it should be abolished for ever.
('15', 282, 1, 5, 561763) In clause (b) also, you will note that there is an addition of the word Indian before the words public opinion.
('15', 282, 2, 6, 561875) Mr. Gandhi read the resolution in Hindi and explained the object of the resolution.

('15', 282, 5, 9, 562097) December 29, 1916
('15', 282, 6, 10, 562115) What I have got to say I shall say afterwards.
('15', 282, 6, 11, 562162) I shall begin with the lessons I have learnt from the speakers who have preceded me.
('15', 282, 6, 12, 562247) I hail from Gujarat.
('15', 282, 6, 13, 562268) My Hindi is broken.
('15', 282, 6, 14, 562288) I speak to you, brothers, in that broken Hindi of mine, because even if I speak a little of English, I have the feeling that I am committing a sin.
('15', 282, 6, 15, 562436) I need not speak to you about the glories of Hindi.
('15', 282, 6, 16, 562488) Your desire to hear from me about the glories of Hindi is as if someone who regularly bathes in the Ganga should invoke that river to come to him.
('15', 282, 6, 17, 562635) If someone living in Rajputana were to make such a supplication, it would be different.
('15', 282, 6, 18, 562723) That you should study Hindi and master Devnagari is not for me to tell you.
('15', 282, 6, 19, 562799) It is as absurd as asking Muslims to learn Urdu.
('15', 282, 6, 20, 562848) You say, I am a man not of speech but of action.
('15', 282, 6, 21, 562897) Then do what I say.
('15', 282, 6, 22, 562917) Gentlemen, you see that the Christian Literature Depot and Bible Society is going all round the world.
('15', 282, 6, 23, 563020) It scatters its books everywhere.
('15', 282, 6, 24, 563054) It has them translated into all the languages and then distributes them at the right places.
('15', 282, 6, 25, 563147) Even to the aborigines and working people in Africa it provides the Bible in their own languages.
('15', 282, 6, 26, 563245) It spends crores of rupees on this job.
('15', 282, 6, 27, 563285) They do not simply hold conferences like we do.
('15', 282, 7, 28, 563333) 1 Gandhi presided at the Conference.
('15', 283, 0, 1, 563370) 284 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 283, 1, 2, 563412) Sometimes they do meet but only to collect money or to submit their reports.
('15', 283, 1, 3, 563489) If we had men to teach Hindi, to do work, even the people of Madras would be knowing Hindi today.
('15', 283, 1, 4, 563587) It is not mere conferences but work that we needwork such as the Christian Literature Depot and Bible Society is doing.
('15', 283, 1, 5, 563707) All work requires money.
('15', 283, 1, 6, 563732) But there is no paucity of money.
('15', 283, 1, 7, 563766) There is paucity only of workers.
('15', 283, 1, 8, 563800) If we have workers, people in Gujarat, Madras, South India and elsewhere can learn Hindi.
('15', 283, 1, 9, 563890) Let more and more books be translated into Hindi, let people go out and teach, and let those coming in be taught.
('15', 283, 1, 10, 564004) If workers are sent to the South or to Gujarat to teach and disseminate Hindi, they will not be entirely unpaid, they will get subsistence wages.
('15', 283, 1, 11, 564150) In olden times, the age of the rishis, there was great self sacrifice, and learning was imparted without payment.
('15', 283, 1, 12, 564264) I wanted to learn Hindi but found no one in Ahmedabad to teach me.
('15', 283, 1, 13, 564331) I learnt my Hindi from a Gujarati gentleman who had only a working knowledge of the language and who had spent 15 or 20 years in Benares.
('15', 283, 1, 14, 564469) If the conference sends out men, a large number of people will be able to learn Hindi.
('15', 283, 1, 15, 564556) You want swaraj.
('15', 283, 1, 16, 564573) So do I. But the way to gain swaraj is a different one altogether [from what is usually adopted].
('15', 283, 1, 17, 564671) Swaraj cannot be got by mere talking.
('15', 283, 1, 18, 564709) You must first do some work yourselves and then only seek aid from the Government.
('15', 283, 1, 19, 564792) Government aid will not be forthcoming before that.
('15', 283, 1, 20, 564844) If you first go forward on your own, the Government will follow you.
('15', 283, 1, 21, 564913) A Government never of itself takes the first step.
('15', 283, 1, 22, 564964) You go out and teach Hindi to people and put in earnest work.
('15', 283, 1, 23, 565026) Only when you have done some work will the Government listen to you, otherwise it will throw your applications aside.
('15', 283, 1, 24, 565144) The task is a big one, but if you have the will you can construct the edifice of swaraj.
('15', 283, 1, 25, 565233) Panditji (Malaviyaji) has dwelt at length on our past glory.
('15', 283, 1, 26, 565294) English first had a vocabulary of a thousand words.
('15', 283, 1, 27, 565346) Now it has increased to a hundred thousand.
('15', 283, 1, 28, 565390) There are books in that language on all subjects, such as jurisprudence, medicine, etc.
('15', 283, 1, 29, 565478) People say Hindi has nothing and that we cannot do without English.
('15', 283, 1, 30, 565546) At times people have to put up with great inconvenience owing to ignorance of English.
('15', 283, 1, 31, 565633) I grant that it is so.
('15', 283, 1, 32, 565656) On the trains people have to suffer much on account of English.
('15', 283, 1, 33, 565720) So much so, that people like me get pushed about for speaking Hindi.
('15', 283, 1, 34, 565789) But those who have work to do cannot take notice of it.
('15', 283, 1, 35, 565845) However backward Hindi may be as compared to English, we must advance its status.
('15', 283, 1, 36, 565927) Our ancient rishis lived under rigid rules of conduct.
('15', 283, 1, 37, 565982) They showed great self sacrifice.
('15', 283, 1, 38, 566016) We must gird up our loins and do them honour by renouncing all self interest.
('15', 283, 1, 39, 566094) In Government

('15', 284, 1, 2, 566150) councils English alone counts.
('15', 284, 1, 3, 566181) It is said that the Viceroy and others know no language except English and that therefore it is necessary to use only English.
('15', 284, 1, 4, 566308) But I assert that if I know how to speak and if there is something in my speech from which the Viceroy may benefit, he will certainly hear it even if it is made in Hindi.
('15', 284, 1, 5, 566479) If necessary he will get it translated.
('15', 284, 1, 6, 566519) Or a C.I.D. man will come and take a report of it.
('15', 284, 1, 7, 566570) It is from the people themselves that I ask for swaraj If you have received this swaraj from the people, you will get it also from the Government.
('15', 284, 1, 8, 566717) Once you have done this, you will become truly fearless and your aspirations will be fulfilled.

('15', 284, 5, 12, 566936) December 29, 1916
('15', 284, 6, 13, 566954) BROTHERS, Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya has dwelt at length on the past glory of Hindi.
('15', 284, 6, 14, 567040) But this in itself will not make for the spread of the National Language.
('15', 284, 6, 15, 567114) You cannot get the merit of a dip in the Bhagirathi 1 by merely saying that the glory of the Bhagirathi is great.
('15', 284, 6, 16, 567228) Bhagirath prayatna 2 is required if we want Hindi to spread.
('15', 284, 6, 17, 567289) Which language do you employ when you petition the Viceroy or the Government?
('15', 284, 6, 18, 567367) If you have not been employing Hindi, do so now.
('15', 284, 6, 19, 567416) You may say that you will not be heard if you use that language.
('15', 284, 6, 20, 567481) I say to you: Speak in your language, write in your language.
('15', 284, 6, 21, 567543) If they have got to hear what you say, they shall hear.
('15', 284, 6, 22, 567599) I will say what I have to say in my own language.
('15', 284, 6, 23, 567649) He who has to listen will listen.
('15', 284, 6, 24, 567683) If you act on this resolve, the status of Hindi will rise.
('15', 284, 6, 25, 567742) Hindi has not made much headway in all provinces so far.
('15', 284, 6, 26, 567799) The rashtra bhasha 3 is not yet popular in the rashtra sabha 4. Whose fault is it?
('15', 284, 6, 27, 567882) I say it is yours.
('15', 284, 7, 28, 567901) 1 Bhagirath, after heroic efforts, brought down the Ganga from heaven; hence the river is also called Bhagirathi.

('15', 285, 0, 1, 568075) 286 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 285, 1, 2, 568117) needed and still need some one knowing Hindi to teach me the language.
('15', 285, 1, 3, 568188) But there was none to be found in Ahmedabad who could give lessons to me and to those in my Ashram.
('15', 285, 1, 4, 568288) Hindi has not spread in Madras yet.
('15', 285, 1, 5, 568324) You have made no effort to that end.
('15', 285, 1, 6, 568361) Please find five or ten people who will go to Madras and spread Hindi.
('15', 285, 1, 7, 568432) Pay them proper remuneration.
('15', 285, 1, 8, 568462) It is not difficult to find the funds for, after all, you spend so much money on these conferences.
('15', 285, 1, 9, 568562) If such an effort is made, Hindi is bound to spread everywhere.

('15', 285, 5, 13, 568700) [About December 29/31, 1916]
('15', 285, 6, 14, 568729) NATIONAL LANGUAGE
('15', 285, 7, 15, 568747) Q. Do you consider it necessary that the business of the Congress should be conducted in Hindi, our national language?
('15', 285, 7, 16, 568866) A. I do.
('15', 285, 7, 17, 568875) So long as public business is not conducted in Hindi, the country cannot make progress.
('15', 285, 7, 18, 568963) So long as the Congress does not use Hindi for all its work, swaraj is not possible.
('15', 285, 8, 19, 569048) Q. But how can it be possible for people of all the provinces all of a sudden to learn Hindi and start speaking it?
('15', 285, 8, 20, 569164) A. I do not say that the provinces should all give up their own languages and start speaking, and writing Hindi.
('15', 285, 8, 21, 569277) In provincial matters, the provincial languages may be used.
('15', 285, 8, 22, 569338) But national questions ought to be deliberated in the national language only.
('15', 285, 8, 23, 569416) It is not a very difficult mater.
('15', 285, 8, 24, 569450) It can be easily done.
('15', 285, 8, 25, 569473) We should use Hindi for the work that we are today doing in English.
('15', 285, 9, 26, 569542) SWARAJ OF CONGRESS
('15', 285, 10, 27, 569561) Q. What do you think of the swaraj resolution passed by the Congress and the way it is going to be implemented A. It may be good or it may be bad, but I do not have any high opinion of it.
('15', 285, 11, 28, 569750) Q. Why so?
('15', 285, 11, 29, 569761) A. Because ill will is inherent in it.
('15', 285, 12, 30, 569800) Q. There wouldnt seem to be any ill will in it and if it has it is only towards
('15', 286, 0, 1, 569880) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 287
('15', 286, 1, 2, 569922) the bureaucracy.
('15', 286, 1, 3, 569939) A. It may be towards the bureaucracy, but it is ill will all the same.
('15', 286, 1, 4, 570010) Therefore I have no high opinion of it.
('15', 286, 1, 5, 570050) But I cannot say that the venture is unworthy or that it will fail.
('15', 286, 1, 6, 570118) Ill will does not everywhere do harm.
('15', 286, 1, 7, 570156) Ill will has to be shown towards ill will when we wish to remove it from our hearts.
('15', 286, 1, 8, 570241) But this is not my way.
('15', 286, 1, 9, 570265) This is not the Indian waythe ancient, traditional way; this is the Western way.
('15', 286, 2, 10, 570346) Q. Then what is your or rather our own Indian way?
('15', 286, 2, 11, 570397) A. We shall not go into it now.
('15', 286, 3, 12, 570429) INSTITUTION OF VARNASHRAM
('15', 286, 4, 13, 570455) Q. What are your views on the system of the four varnas?
('15', 286, 4, 14, 570512) A. It is a very good institution.
('15', 286, 4, 15, 570546) It has done much good to the country.
('15', 286, 4, 16, 570584) It must be preserved.
('15', 286, 5, 17, 570606) Q. If there are only four varnas in Hindu society and if they are to remain as they are, in which varna would you include the untouchable castes?
('15', 286, 5, 18, 570752) A. The untouchable castes owe their existence to the excesses of the system.
('15', 286, 5, 19, 570829) The four varnas ostracised them through undue excesses.
('15', 286, 5, 20, 570885) Their place is inside the system.
('15', 286, 6, 21, 570919) Q. If that is so, in which varna ought they to be placed?
('15', 286, 7, 22, 570977) Answering this question, Gandhiji explained at length how in the normal flow of society they would all find the varnas to which they were entitled.
('15', 286, 8, 23, 571125) SHUDDHI MOVEMENT OF ARYA SAMAJ
('15', 286, 9, 24, 571156) Q. What will be the solution of the Hindu Muslim question?
('15', 286, 9, 25, 571215) A. This question cannot be solved finally.
('15', 286, 9, 26, 571258) What happened in other countries will happen here.
('15', 286, 9, 27, 571309) Hindus and Muslims will remain as two communities and this will do no harm to the country.
('15', 286, 10, 28, 571400) Q. The Arya Samaj converts Muslims to Hinduism through shuddhi.
('15', 286, 10, 29, 571464) If this
('15', 286, 11, 30, 571472) practice does not violate religion and if one can conceive that through it all the Muslims can become Hindus, will it not solve the question?
('15', 286, 11, 31, 571614) A. But it is not the right path.
('15', 286, 11, 32, 571647) It is not the path of religion.
('15', 286, 11, 33, 571679) It is not natural and the dream of converting all the Muslims to Hinduism is a vain one.

('15', 287, 2, 3, 571907) December 31, 1916
('15', 287, 3, 4, 571925) The Muslim League resumed its sitting this morning, the attendance being as large as yesterday.
('15', 287, 3, 5, 572021) Mr. Wazir Hassan, Secretary of the League, presented the report of the reform committee appointed at Bombay last year.
('15', 287, 3, 6, 572140) The report was on the same lines as the report that was placed before the National Congress this year.
('15', 287, 4, 7, 572243) A resolution protesting against the treatment of Indians in the Colonies was next put from the chair (Mr. Jinnah) and carried.
('15', 287, 5, 8, 572370) At this stage, Mr. Gandhi who was present at the meeting was asked to address the meeting.
('15', 287, 6, 9, 572461) He exhorted them to conduct their proceedings in Urdu if they wished to carry out their resolution to maintain Urdu as the lingua franca of India.
('15', 287, 6, 10, 572608) He further urged
('15', 287, 7, 11, 572625) them to take some interest in Hindu literature which would enable them to arrive at a permanent rapprochement with the Hindus.
('15', 287, 7, 12, 572752) In the Colonies, Hindus and Mussalmans had always co operated in taking concerted measures and, if that example was followed in India, the coveted prize would soon be theirs.
('15', 287, 7, 13, 572927) He also advised them that in the course of their propaganda they should not be afraid of the Government because it was in the nature of Englishmen to bow before the strong and ride over the weak.

('15', 291, 1, 2, 577740) It was at Agra that this letter came accidentally to my hands.
('15', 291, 1, 3, 577803) It was printed in the Government press and was marked private.
('15', 291, 1, 4, 577866) But it came to my hands through the mistake of some pressman along with a book.
('15', 291, 1, 5, 577946) The moment I saw it I was startled, and on seeing the danger that stood before the country, I resolved to expose the conspiracy before the Congress somehow or other, and I handed it over to Mr. Horniman 1. But at that time l made a suggestion that Mr. Curtis should be given 24 hours notice to make any explanation which he thought fit.
('15', 291, 1, 6, 578283) But others thought it was ones duty to publish it then and there, and that there was no necessity to give such a notice; I also agreed to this.
('15', 291, 1, 7, 578427) If underneath our houses somebody digs a mine and fills it with explosives, and if our enemy thinks of blowing it up when there is a gathering there, and he sends a chit round marked Private and confidential, it is our duty to catch hold of it and expose it.

('15', 293, 10, 15, 581793) NARANDAS, I have resolved on two changes: one, that in buying land for the farm our object should be to have a good return by way of yield, the object being that even a man with a family may be drawn to this work; two, to start a national school 2, be it on a big scale or small, and engage well educated teachers for it.
('15', 293, 10, 16, 582115) Paid men should be engaged for both these purposes and the payment should be at market rates.

('15', 295, 3, 4, 584593) PROSPECTUS
('15', 295, 4, 5, 584604) For many years past, several friends and I have felt that our present education is not national and that in consequence people do not get from it the benefit they ought to.
('15', 295, 4, 6, 584777) Our children languish as a result of this education.
('15', 295, 4, 7, 584830) They become incapable of any great achievement and the knowledge they acquire does not spread among the massesnot even in their families.
('15', 295, 4, 8, 584968) Nor do the young people have any aim in mind in taking this modern education except to get a job and make money.
('15', 295, 4, 9, 585081) It is one of the fundamental principles of education that it should be planned with a view to the needs of the people.
('15', 295, 4, 10, 585200) This idea finds no place at all in our schools.
('15', 295, 4, 11, 585248) Wherever I have travelled in India, I have discussed this question with the leaders and, without exception, almost every one has admitted that our educational system must change.
('15', 295, 4, 12, 585427) To look to the Government for this will be sheer waste of time.
('15', 295, 4, 13, 585491) The Government will wait on public opinion and, being foreign, move very timidly; it cannot understand our needs, its advisers may be ill informed or they may have interests of their own to serve.
('15', 295, 4, 14, 585688) For a variety of such reasons, it will probably be quite long before there is any serious change in the present system; the time that passes meanwhile is so much loss to the people.
('15', 295, 4, 15, 585870) It is, however, not intended to suggest here that we should not try to get the Government to move.
('15', 295, 4, 16, 585969) Let petitions be made to it and let public opinion be ascertained.
('15', 295, 4, 17, 586036) But the best petition to the Government will be an actual demonstration by us and this will also be the easiest way of cultivating public opinion.
('15', 295, 4, 18, 586183) It has accordingly been decided, in consultation with some educated gentlemen, to start a national school.
('15', 295, 4, 19, 586290) Education in the School Basic principle: The education will be physical, intellectual and religious.
('15', 295, 4, 20, 586391) For physical education, there will be training in agriculture and hand weaving and in the use of carpenters and blacksmiths tools incidental to these.
('15', 295, 4, 21, 586542) That will provide sufficient exercise for the pupils.
('15', 295, 5, 22, 586596) 1 Vide the preceding item.
('15', 296, 0, 1, 586623) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 297
('15', 296, 1, 2, 586665) In addition, they will be given drill, which is both an entertainment [and a practical utility] 1 and, as part of this, they will be taught how to march in squads and how each one may work with quiet efficiency in case of accidents such as fire.
('15', 296, 1, 3, 586911) They will have instruction on how to preserve health and on home remedies for ordinary ailments, with as much of physiology and botany as may be necessary for the purpose.
('15', 296, 1, 4, 587083) For intellectual training, they will study Gujarati, Marathi, Hindi and Sanskrit as compulsory subjects.
('15', 296, 1, 5, 587188) Urdu, Tamil and Bengali will also be taught.
('15', 296, 1, 6, 587233) There will be no teaching of English during the first three years.
('15', 296, 1, 7, 587300) In addition, the pupils will be taught Mathematics (Arithmetic, Algebra and Geometry).
('15', 296, 1, 8, 587387) Instruction in multiplication tables, Indian book keeping and the measures, weights, etc., currently in use will begin at once and the rest of the curriculum will be covered progressively.
('15', 296, 1, 9, 587576) There will be instruction in History, Geography, Elements of Astronomy and Elements of Chemistry.
('15', 296, 1, 10, 587674) By way of instruction in religion, pupils will be taught general ethical principles and we are hopeful that the teachers will demonstrate by their conduct that the essence of religion is good character.
('15', 296, 1, 11, 587877) All teaching will be through Gujarati, right up to the highest stage, and most of it will be oral during the first few years.
('15', 296, 1, 12, 588003) The intention is to put across to the children, before they learn to read and write, quite a few things orally by way of stories, as was the practice in old days, and so help their minds to grow, and to give them some general knowledge as they play about, rather than repress them by doing nothing more than remarking, Oh dear, dear!
('15', 296, 1, 13, 588337) How dirty, and so on.
('15', 296, 2, 14, 588359) EXPLANATION
('15', 296, 3, 15, 588371) The aim at present is that after a few years of such education, the students equipment will approximate to that of a well informed graduate.
('15', 296, 3, 16, 588512) That is, he will have a reduced load by way of learning English and, during the time so saved, he will be given all the useful knowledge a graduate acquires.
('15', 296, 3, 17, 588670) He will be freed from the fear of examinations.
('15', 296, 3, 18, 588718) All the students will be tested from time to time, but that

('15', 297, 0, 1, 588813) 298 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 297, 1, 2, 588855) will be by the teachers of the school itself.
('15', 297, 1, 3, 588901) The use to which the student puts his abilities after leaving school will be the true measure of the worth of his education.
('15', 297, 1, 4, 589026) Every opportunity will be taken to rid his mind of the fallacious notion that the aim of education is to get employment.
('15', 297, 1, 5, 589147) And, finally, every pupil joining this school is likely to develop such self confidence in a few years that he will not be troubled with doubts or fears about how he will make a living.
('15', 297, 1, 6, 589333) A pupil who has been in the school for five years will be fixed up, if he so desires, in some work in the school itself and be paid for it.
('15', 297, 1, 7, 589473) The school will make arrangements with some factories, etc., so that they provide training in vocations and give a start to those who wish to set themselves up independently.
('15', 297, 1, 8, 589648) If, after ten years of study, anyone wants to pursue a subject further, necessary arrangements for the purpose are left to the future.
('15', 297, 2, 9, 589783) FREE EDUCATION No fees will be charged in this school, the expenses being met from donations received.
('15', 297, 3, 10, 589886) TEACHERS Paid teachers will be engaged and will be, all of them, grown up men who have reached the college level or possess equivalent attainments.
('15', 297, 3, 11, 590034) The idea is that children should have the best teachers in the early stages.

('15', 297, 8, 17, 590400) It is full of complaints against me regarding absence of any letter from me.

('15', 297, 8, 19, 590512) Last week I gave you my reasons for it.

('15', 298, 1, 3, 590750) We are well here.
('15', 298, 1, 4, 590768) From the 1 health point of view the condition of the Ashram has been never so good as now.

('15', 298, 1, 6, 590909) I met Andrews in Lucknow.

('15', 298, 6, 18, 591353) DEAR DR.
('15', 298, 6, 19, 591362) DEVA 3, I have your p.c.
('15', 298, 6, 20, 591387) I feel that every time we met to celebrate the anniversary, we should take a step in advance in keeping with the ideals for which Mr. Gokhale stood.
('15', 298, 6, 21, 591536) Such is the suggestion I have made locally and it has been accepted.
('15', 298, 6, 22, 591605) This year, therefore, here we shall probably publish a Gujarati translation of all Mr. Gokhales speeches.
('15', 298, 6, 23, 591711) I make a similar suggestion for Poona.
('15', 298, 6, 24, 591750) There we may resolve at the meeting to translate his speeches in Marathi if they are not already translated or do some other practical thing.
('15', 298, 6, 25, 591892) I would so like that he may live more and more in us and through us and thereby through the whole nation.
('15', 298, 6, 26, 591998) This will not happen unless at such functions we take progressive steps.
('15', 298, 6, 27, 592071) I am pulled in opposite directions by two attractionsone from Poona and the other from Ahmedabad.
('15', 298, 6, 28, 592169) There are reasons for which I should like to be in Ahmedabad that day.
('15', 298, 6, 29, 592240) There are equally good reasons which tell me I should go to Poona.
('15', 298, 6, 30, 592307) You shall decide as to what I should do.

('15', 299, 1, 3, 592650) For the business meeting after the celebration, I think there should be two.
('15', 299, 1, 4, 592727) Both may be the same day with sufficiently long intervals.
('15', 299, 1, 5, 592786) The first may be confined only to the usual friends.
('15', 299, 1, 6, 592839) The other may be of a more general character to which the Tilak group may come.

('15', 299, 6, 12, 593118) [February 1, 1917] 2
('15', 299, 7, 13, 593139) The following is the introduction written by Mr. M. K. Gandhi to Dr. P. J. Mehtas Self Government Series Pamphlet No.
('15', 299, 7, 14, 593257) I entitled Vernaculars as Media of Instruction in Indian Schools and Colleges: It is to be hoped that Dr. Mehtas labour of love will receive the serious attention of English educated India.
('15', 299, 7, 15, 593447) The following pages were written by him for the Vedanta Kesari of Madras and are now printed in their present form for circulation throughout India.
('15', 299, 7, 16, 593596) The question of vernaculars as media of instruction is of national importance; neglect of the vernaculars means national suicide.
('15', 299, 7, 17, 593726) One hears many protagonists of the English language being continued as the medium of instruction pointing to the fact that English educated Indians are the sole custodians of public and patriotic work.
('15', 299, 7, 18, 593928) It would be monstrous if it were not so.
('15', 299, 7, 19, 593969) For, the only education given in this country is through the English language.
('15', 299, 7, 20, 594048) The fact, however, is that the results are not at all proportionate to the time we give to our education.
('15', 299, 7, 21, 594154) We have not reacted on the masses.
('15', 299, 7, 22, 594189) But I must not anticipate Dr. Mehta.
('15', 299, 7, 23, 594226) He is in earnest.
('15', 299, 7, 24, 594244) He writes feelingly.
('15', 299, 7, 25, 594265) He has examined the pros and cons and collected a mass of evidence in support of his arguments.
('15', 299, 7, 26, 594361) The latest pronouncement on the subject is that of the Viceroy.
('15', 299, 7, 27, 594425) Whilst His Excellency is unable to offer a solution, he is keenly alive to the necessity of imparting instruction in our

('15', 300, 1, 2, 594677) schools through the vernaculars.
('15', 300, 1, 3, 594710) The Jews of Middle and Eastern Europe, who are scattered in all parts of the world, finding it necessary to have a common tongue for mutual intercourse, have raised Yiddish to the status of a language and have succeeded in translating into Yiddish the best books to be found in the worlds literature.
('15', 300, 1, 4, 595011) Even they could not satisfy the souls yearning through the many foreign tongues of which they are masters; nor did the learned few among them wish to tax the masses of the Jewish population with having to learn a foreign language before they could realise their dignity.
('15', 300, 1, 5, 595282) So they have enriched what was at one time looked upon as a mere jargonbut what the Jewish children learnt from their mothersby taking special pains to translate into it the best thought of the world.
('15', 300, 1, 6, 595483) This is a truly marvellous work.
('15', 300, 1, 7, 595516) It has been done during the present generation, and Websters Dictionary defines it as a polyglot jargon used for inter communication by Jews from different nations.
('15', 300, 1, 8, 595681) But a Jew of Middle and Eastern Europe would feel insulted if his mother tongue were now so described.
('15', 300, 1, 9, 595784) If these Jewish scholars have succeeded, within a generation, in giving their masses a language, of which they may feel proud, surely it should be an easy task for us to supply the needs of our own vernaculars which are cultured languages.
('15', 300, 1, 10, 596024) South Africa teaches us the same lesson.
('15', 300, 1, 11, 596065) There was a duel there between Taal, a corrupt form of Dutch, and English.
('15', 300, 1, 12, 596140) The Boer mothers and the Boer fathers were determined that they would not let their children, with whom they in their infancy talked in Taal, be weighed down with having to receive instruction through English.
('15', 300, 1, 13, 596350) The case of English here was a strong one.
('15', 300, 1, 14, 596393) It had able pleaders for it.
('15', 300, 1, 15, 596422) But English had to yield before Boer patriotism.
('15', 300, 1, 16, 596471) It may be observed that they rejected even the High Dutch.
('15', 300, 1, 17, 596530) The school masters, therefore, who are accustomed to speak the polished Dutch of Europe, are compelled to teach the easier Taal.
('15', 300, 1, 18, 596659) And literature of an excellent character is at the present moment growing up in South Africa in the Taal, which was only a few years ago the common medium of speech between simple but brave rustics.
('15', 300, 1, 19, 596858) If we have lost faith in our vernaculars, it is a sign of want of faith in ourselves; it is the surest sign of decay.
('15', 300, 1, 20, 596976) And no scheme of Self Government, however benevolently or generously it may be bestowed upon us, will ever make us a self governing nation, if we have no respect for the languages our mothers speak.

('15', 301, 2, 3, 597283) SATYAGRAHA ASHRAM, AHMEDABAD, Maha Sud 10, Samvat 1973, [February 1, 1917]
('15', 301, 3, 4, 597358) I wish Bhai Karsandas 2 success in his endeavour.
('15', 301, 3, 5, 597408) Eating or drinking, awake or asleep, sitting or standing, Bhai Karsandas Chitalia always has the Bhagini Samaj uppermost in his mind.
('15', 301, 3, 6, 597542) He believes that the service of women is the service of the country and that the service of women is possible through the Bhagini Samaj.
('15', 301, 3, 7, 597679) That is why Bhai Karsandas has become the moving spirit of the Bhagini Samaj.
('15', 301, 3, 8, 597757) In doing so, he is fully keeping the pledge he has taken for the Servants of India Society.
('15', 301, 3, 9, 597849) This is his belief.
('15', 301, 3, 10, 597869) Once Bhai Deodhar remarked in jest that some way would have to be found to cure Bhai Karsandas of the obsession.
('15', 301, 3, 11, 597982) This remark was by way of a homage and the homage was genuine.
('15', 301, 3, 12, 598045) India badly needs persons who can be so totally dedicated to their work.
('15', 301, 3, 13, 598118) I know Karsandas to be such a person, so I could not decline his request to write the foreword.
('15', 301, 3, 14, 598214) Since I had to write the foreword, I was forced to read the book by Bhogindrarao Divetia.
('15', 301, 3, 15, 598304) Many problems concerning women have been discussed in this work in a beautiful, easy and concise language.
('15', 301, 3, 16, 598411) Instead of asserting his views, Devatia has merely expressed them by way of suggestions.
('15', 301, 3, 17, 598500) It has struck me as a distinctive trait of Divetias writing.
('15', 301, 3, 18, 598561) In a book about women, for that matter even about men, meant for the general reader, assertions become a hindrance.
('15', 301, 3, 19, 598677) I hope that the reader will not infer that because I am writing this introduction I approve of all the reforms the author advocates.
('15', 301, 3, 20, 598810) Bhai Divetia has placed his views before the reader in an interesting manner.
('15', 301, 3, 21, 598888) it may be hoped that his writing will be widely read.
('15', 301, 3, 22, 598942) In his dialogues the writer has depicted the husband as a teacher to his wife.
('15', 301, 3, 23, 599021) This seems pretty realistic.
('15', 301, 3, 24, 599050) We desire girls education.
('15', 301, 3, 25, 599077) But we have yet to discover what type of education it should be.
('15', 301, 3, 26, 599142) For the present, we are only experimenting.
('15', 301, 3, 27, 599186) But we are not going to bring about womens education merely through girls schools.

('15', 302, 1, 2, 599488) of girls disappear from before our eyes by becoming victims to child marriage as early as at the age of twelve.
('15', 302, 1, 3, 599600) They become housewives!
('15', 302, 1, 4, 599624) So long as this sinful custom does not disappear from amongst us, men will have to learn to be the teachers of women.
('15', 302, 1, 5, 599742) [The fulfilment of] many of our hopes lies in their education in this respect.
('15', 302, 1, 6, 599821) So long as our women do not cease to be objects of our lust and our cooks and do not become our better halves, sharing our happiness and misery, all our efforts will be futile.
('15', 302, 1, 7, 599998) Some people regard their wives as animals.
('15', 302, 1, 8, 600041) Some of the things in our old Sanskrit texts, as also a famous couplet of Tulsidas, are to blame for this.
('15', 302, 1, 9, 600148) Tulsidas has written in one place: drums, boors, shudras, animals and women, all are fit to be beaten. I am a devotee of Tulsidas.
('15', 302, 1, 10, 600279) But my devotion is not blind.
('15', 302, 1, 11, 600309) Either the above couplet is an interpolation, or if it is really by Tulsidas, he must have written it without thought, only expressing the prevalent attitude.
('15', 302, 1, 12, 600468) As for the utterances in the Sanskrit texts, the idea seems to have become fixed that every verse coined in Sanskrit is the word of the scriptures.
('15', 302, 1, 13, 600616) We must get rid of this false notion and do away with this age old attitude that regards women as inferior creatures.
('15', 302, 1, 14, 600734) On the other hand, some of us, blinded by passion, worship women as a goddess or treat her as a doll and decorate her with ornaments as we decorate the idols every day.
('15', 302, 1, 15, 600903) It is necessary for us to free ourselves of this wrong worship also.
('15', 302, 1, 16, 600972) Shiva had Uma, Rama had Sita, Nala had Damayanti.
('15', 302, 1, 17, 601022) When our women, too, participate in our discussions, argue with us, understand and support our utterances, with their extraordinary intuition, understand and share our external troubles and bring to us the balm of peace, then, and not till then, will our salvation become possible.
('15', 302, 1, 18, 601304) There is very little chance of bringing about such a situation merely through girls schools.
('15', 302, 1, 19, 601397) So long as we carry round our necks the millstone of child marriage, husbands will have to act as teachers to their wives.
('15', 302, 1, 20, 601520) And such education must not be confined to a knowledge of letters.
('15', 302, 1, 21, 601587) Gradually they can be introduced to subjects like polities and social reform.
('15', 302, 1, 22, 601665) Literacy should not be a precondition to this.
('15', 302, 1, 23, 601712) Husbands will have to change their attitude towards their wives.
('15', 302, 1, 24, 601777) Is it not possible for a woman to remain a student till she attains maturity and for the husband to observe brahmacharya till such time?
('15', 302, 1, 25, 601914) Unless we were crushed with insensibility and inertia, we would certainly not subject a girl of twelve or fifteen to the great strain of child bearing.
('15', 302, 1, 26, 602066) The very thought should make us shudder.
('15', 302, 1, 27, 602107) There are classes for married women and lectures are arranged for them.
('15', 302, 1, 28, 602179) All this is fine.
('15', 302, 1, 29, 602197) Those who are engaged in such activities are

('15', 303, 1, 2, 602284) sacrificing their time and that too is a matter of credit to them.
('15', 303, 1, 3, 602351) At the same time so long as men do not do their duty as stated above, we are not likely to get very good results.
('15', 303, 1, 4, 602465) With a little thought, everyone will find this self evident.
('15', 303, 1, 5, 602526) Hence, it may be expected that if the Bhagini Samaj can spread among husbands the desire to educate their wives, its objectives can be attained faster.

('15', 303, 4, 9, 602794) February 4, 1917
('15', 303, 5, 10, 602811) Today we, men, have assembled here to register our protest against this system and tomorrow there is to be a meeting of women in the Mahadev 2 temple of Sathodara Nagars 3. These womens meetings started with the one at Kanpur.
('15', 303, 5, 11, 603038) As Mr. Polak and Mr. Andrews report, women labourers suffer very much in the Colonies and hence women too should join in the protest.
('15', 303, 5, 12, 603172) I have seen in Natal the conditions of indentured women and know what they suffer.
('15', 303, 5, 13, 603255) Girmit [agreement] is an English term and means binding oneself under a contract to work as a labourer.
('15', 303, 5, 14, 603359) But the Indian labourers in the Colonies understand by the term girmitio a slave, because they feel their condition to be no better than that of slaves.
('15', 303, 5, 15, 603512) When the British people had succeeded in putting an end to legalized traffic in slaves, they required another race to work as slaves for them.
('15', 303, 5, 16, 603655) They have been recruiting these from among Negroes and our people.
('15', 303, 5, 17, 603722) As Mr. Curtis says 4, we are only a little better than Negroes.
('15', 303, 5, 18, 603786) The law permitting recruitment of indentured labour came into being 50 years ago.
('15', 303, 5, 19, 603868) It had the result of placing Indians in the same condition as slaves.
('15', 303, 5, 20, 603938) The late Sir William Hunter himself described it as slavery.
('15', 303, 5, 21, 603999) It was in 1896 that a protest was first made against this enslaving law.
('15', 303, 5, 22, 604072) It had no effect then and things remained as they were up to 1911. In that year, the practice was prohibited only in respect of Natal.
('15', 303, 5, 23, 604207) In Fiji, however, the condition of

('15', 304, 1, 2, 604465) Indian labourers has been worse than it was in Natal.
('15', 304, 1, 3, 604519) There was a strong public opinion in Natal, but there is none in Fiji.
('15', 304, 1, 4, 604590) Lord Hardinge declared last year 1 that the law would be repealed very soon.
('15', 304, 1, 5, 604667) We had hoped then that it would go after a year or 50. But we hear now, one and a half years after the declaration, that the law will remain for five more years and that afterwards they would see what could be done.
('15', 304, 1, 6, 604883) This report has revived our concern for the sufferings of our fellow countrymen and it has become our duty now to raise a strong protest to ensure the immediate repeal of the law.
('15', 304, 1, 7, 605063) The agitation was launched at Allahabad and, meetings having already been held at Madras, Poona and other places, we also have met here to register our protest.
('15', 304, 1, 8, 605224) Mr. Andrews has dedicated his life to this struggle.
('15', 304, 1, 9, 605277) Mr. Gokhale had the fullest confidence in him and, at his instance, Mr. Andrews and Mr. Pearson went to Fiji to see things for themselves.
('15', 304, 1, 10, 605416) He [Mr. Andrews] had 300 with himthis was all he had and this he made over to the Satyagraha Fund at Lahore.
('15', 304, 1, 11, 605525) He no longer wants to be styled Reverend, but thinks it an honour to be known as Tagores disciple.
('15', 304, 1, 12, 605624) Mr. Polak is known to you.
('15', 304, 1, 13, 605651) He is young, and if the young people here were to do even a tenth of what he has done, we should have swaraj this moment.

('15', 304, 5, 17, 605861) [After February 7, 1917]
('15', 304, 6, 18, 605886) There is no doubt that we are engaged in a severe struggle for the preservation of our honour and that, if we do not take care, the promise made by Lord Hardinge that indentured labour should soon be a thing of the past may be reduced to a nullity.
('15', 304, 6, 19, 606135) The Viceregal pronouncement just made 2 seems to set at rest one fear that the system may be prolonged for a further period of five years which, as Sir Ramakrishna Bhandarkar showed at Poona, would in reality mean ten years.
('15', 304, 6, 20, 606360) We are thankful to Lord Chelmsford for his assurance.
('15', 304, 6, 21, 606414) And we are thankful, too, to that good Englishman Mr. C.F. Andrews, for the lead that he gave us in the matter.

('15', 305, 1, 2, 606689) information from Fiji that five years extension was taken by the planters of those lands as a settled fact, he forsook his sick bed and his rest at Shantiniketan and sounded for us the call of duty.
('15', 305, 2, 3, 606888) But if one cloud that threatened to destroy our hopes seems to have disappeared, another equally dangerous looms on the horizon.
('15', 305, 2, 4, 607017) The conditions of abolition as stated by Lord Hardinge last March 1
('15', 305, 3, 5, 607085) are these:
('15', 305, 4, 6, 607096) On behalf of His Majestys Government, he the Secretary of State has asked us, however, to make it clear that the existing system of recruiting must be maintained until new conditions under which labour should not be permitted to proceed to the Colonies should have been worked out in conjunction with the Colonial Office and the Crown Colonies concerned; until proper safeguards in the Colonies should have been provided and until they should have had reasonable time to adjust themselves to the change, a period which must necessarily depend on circumstances and conditions imperfectly known at present.
('15', 305, 5, 7, 607701) Those of us who know anything of the system knew that it was well nigh impossible to find new conditions which would be economically sound for the planters and morally sound for us.
('15', 305, 5, 8, 607883) We felt that the Government would soon find this out for themselves and that, in view of Lord Hardinges whole hearted disapproval of the system, his view of the nearness of the end would coincide with our 2 own.
('15', 305, 5, 9, 608095) But now a different situation faces us.
('15', 305, 5, 10, 608135) Nearly a year has gone by and we discover that the planters of Fiji have been led to believe that they will have five years more of the system and at the end of it new conditions may after all be a change in name but not in substance.
('15', 305, 5, 11, 608370) Let Mr. Bonar Laws 3 despatch speak for itself.
('15', 305, 5, 12, 608418) Writing under date March 4, 1916, to the Acting Governor of Fiji, he says:
('15', 305, 6, 13, 608493) The Secretary of State for India is satisfied that it would not be possible for the Government of India to continue to defeat by a bare official majority resolutions in their Legislative Council, urging the abolition of indenture; that in his opinion the strong and universal feeling in India on this

('15', 306, 1, 2, 609291) subject makes it a question of urgency and that he has accepted the conclusion that indentured emigration must be abolished.
('15', 306, 1, 3, 609416) He then proceeds:
('15', 306, 2, 4, 609434) Though, from the point of view of the Colonies concerned, the decision which the Indian Government and the Secretary of State for India have taken is to be regretted, I recognize that the final decision upon this question must rest with the Indian Government.
('15', 306, 2, 5, 609694) Thus, the humanities of the question are tacitly supposed to be no concern of the Colonies.
('15', 306, 2, 6, 609786) Now mark this significant paragraph culled from the same illuminating despatch:
('15', 306, 3, 7, 609866) I have, therefore, agreed to the appointment of an inter departmental committee to consider what system should be substituted for the system of indenture, should be allowed for a further period of five years and should cease at the end of that period.
('15', 306, 3, 8, 610118) .The Secretary of State for India is anxious that the change of system should be brought about with as little disturbance as possible to the economic interests of the Colonies and that he has made it clear that the existing system must be maintained until a properly safeguarded system has been devised.
('15', 306, 3, 9, 610422) Mr. Andrews has been twitted for having referred to the five years extension.
('15', 306, 3, 10, 610500) Let his critics explain away Mr. Bonar Laws emphatic pronouncement published in the Fiji newspapers.
('15', 306, 3, 11, 610601) What with the official statement and the Secretary of State for Indias solicitude for the economic interests of the planters, our cause may easily be lost if we are found unwatchful.
('15', 306, 3, 12, 610784) In the light of the Viceregal speech and Mr. Bonar Laws despatch, our duty seems to be clear.
('15', 306, 3, 13, 610878) We must strengthen the Governments hands where necessary and even stimulate their activity so that this inter departmental committee is not allowed to frustrate our hopes.
('15', 306, 3, 14, 611050) It is a body wherein the influence of the Crown Colonies and the Colonial Office will be preponderant.
('15', 306, 3, 15, 611153) It is a body which has to find a substitute which would be acceptable to us.
('15', 306, 3, 16, 611230) As I hold, it will be a vain search if the mere well being of the labourer is to be the primary consideration.
('15', 306, 3, 17, 611341) But if the planters can have their own way, we know that they will urge an impossible substitute and, in the event of its rejection by us, they will, in accordance with Mr. Bonar Laws despatch, claim continuance of recruiting under indenture.
('15', 306, 3, 18, 611584) It must therefore be clearly understood that the onus of producing an acceptable substitute rests with them and not with us.
('15', 306, 3, 19, 611709) They have had
('15', 307, 0, 1, 611723) 308 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 307, 1, 2, 611765) more than a year already.
('15', 307, 1, 3, 611791) Lord Hardinges despatch urging total abolition is dated the 15th October 1915. The committee is to sit in May next.
('15', 307, 1, 4, 611907) This period for finding a substitute is long enough in all conscience.
('15', 307, 1, 5, 611978) Either Mr. Andrews harrowing picture of the conditions of life in Fiji is true or it is untrue.
('15', 307, 1, 6, 612074) We believe it to be true and it has never been seriously attacked.
('15', 307, 1, 7, 612141) And in waiting for over a year, we shall have waited almost beyond the point of endurance.
('15', 307, 1, 8, 612232) Substitute or no substitute, we are entitled for the sake of our own honour and reputation and indeed that of the Empire to the unconditional abolition of this last remnant of slavery.
('15', 307, 1, 9, 612417) Natal stopped 1 the system without the provision of a substitute.
('15', 307, 1, 10, 612483) Mauritius has done likewise.
('15', 307, 1, 11, 612512) The Johannesburg mines survived not only the shock of an abrupt termination of Chinese labour but the withdrawal of every Chinese labourer from the country as fast as transport could be got ready.
('15', 307, 1, 12, 612709) Capital is both bold and timid.
('15', 307, 1, 13, 612741) If only we shall do our duty, if only the Government of India will steel their hearts against the blandishments of the Fijian and West Indian planters, there is no doubt that these people will know how to save millions without Indias having to go to their rescue.

('15', 307, 4, 16, 613106) February 9, 1917
('15', 307, 5, 17, 613123) At a public meeting held at the Excelsior Theatre, Bombay, on February 9, 1917, under the presidentship of Sir Jamsetji Jeejibhoy, a resolution, moved by Sir N.G. Chandavarkar, demanding the immediate abolition of indentured labour, was unanimously passed.
('15', 307, 5, 18, 613380) Mr. H. A. Wadia then proposed that the chairman of the meeting be authorised to communicate the resolution to His Majestys Secretary of State for India and H. E. the Viceroy and Governor General of India by telegram.
('15', 307, 6, 19, 613597) Mr. M. K. Gandhi supporting the resolution said that, yielding to the command of his friends on the platform, he had undertaken to speak to them in English on that occasion.
('15', 307, 6, 20, 613771) The resolution which he supported asked that the preceding resolution be sent to the Secretary of State for India and H. E. the Viceroy by telegram.
('15', 307, 6, 21, 613920) What was the meaning of this?
('15', 307, 6, 22, 613950) They had fixed with great deliberation the
('15', 307, 7, 23, 613993) 1 The indenture system was brought to an end in Natal by the Indian Governments refusal in 1911 to allow recruitment.

('15', 308, 1, 2, 614153) 31st of May of this year as the last date on which this remnant of slavery should come to an end.
('15', 308, 1, 3, 614251) (Applause.) It meant that they had slept for nearly 50 years and allowed this system to continue, but that immediately they were awakened to their sense of responsibility and duty, they did not like to sleep for a day longer and it was, therefore, that they wished that the resolution should be wired without a moments delay.
('15', 308, 1, 4, 614577) In passing that resolution, they were strengthening the hands of the Government and were awakening the Colonies to a sense of their duty to consider India as an integral part of the Empire.
('15', 308, 1, 5, 614767) It would also strengthen the Viceroys hands, and H. E. the Viceroy could say that he would no longer govern India if they were not ready to remove the blot of indentured labour before the 31st of May.
('15', 308, 1, 6, 614968) (Applause.) The honour of the people of India was at stake and they were bound to think of it, waking or sleeping.
('15', 308, 1, 7, 615083) He asked them to remember the 31st of May.
('15', 308, 1, 8, 615126) Till then let them not sleep.

('15', 308, 5, 16, 615632) We shall succeed in our aim only if we approach the intending recruits themselves in their homes and dissuade them from joining up; and this task is yours.

('15', 309, 3, 5, 616033) Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya and other friends, I venture to draw public attention to a suggestion I have made to my Ahmedabad friends regarding the celebration of the Gokhale anniversary on the 19th instant.
('15', 309, 3, 6, 616241) It is to the effect that we should at these meetings take a definite practical step from year to year to promote some public object in keeping with the teachings of the deceased patriot.
('15', 309, 3, 7, 616428) Ahmedabad will probably raise subscriptions for translating and publishing in Gujarati Mr. Gokhales speeches to be ready for circulation at the latest on the next anniversary.
('15', 309, 3, 8, 616604) Other centres may translate other works or may raise subscriptions to found scholarships for some special training.
('15', 309, 3, 9, 616720) If some such definite and not very ambitious steps are taken at the hundreds of meetings that will be held yearly, the educational advance we shall have in a few years will, it is held, be not inconsiderable.

('15', 310, 3, 6, 617420) You are right in what you say about education.
('15', 310, 3, 7, 617467) It is good that you should go on harassing me on the subject.
('15', 310, 3, 8, 617529) That will keep me more vigilant.
('15', 310, 3, 9, 617562) I shall not misunderstand your worrying me or be impatient with it.

('15', 310, 3, 11, 617753) He should make the necessary arrangements to get it printed on Monday.
('15', 310, 3, 12, 617824) Whatever collection is possible, he should make at the meeting itself.
('15', 310, 3, 13, 617895) You are right in saying that, since the school curriculum provides for Marathi, 3 we too should start learning it.

('15', 310, 6, 21, 618449) February 19, 1917
('15', 310, 7, 22, 618467) Gandhiji presided at a crowded meeting held at Godhra on February 19, 1917 in connection with the Gokhale anniversary, when a resolution was moved appointing a committee to take steps to keep green the memory of Gokhale by furthering the cause of education in the district which was so dear to his heart.
('15', 310, 8, 23, 618772) 1 The first two pages of the letter are not available.
('15', 310, 8, 24, 618827) 2 Gandhiji arrived in Godhra on February 19 and presided over the Gokhale death anniversary meeting.

('15', 311, 0, 1, 618978) 312 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 311, 1, 2, 619020) After the resolution was supported and adopted, Mr. Gandhi rose to deliver his presidential address.
('15', 311, 1, 3, 619121) The first point he touched was the religious catholicity of Mr. Gokhale, who, on one occasion, rebuked a seeming sadhu who drew a sharp line of difference between Hindus and Mahomedans.
('15', 311, 1, 4, 619307) Religious convictions were fast dwindling in this country everywhere, but then another religion was developing and that was love of country.
('15', 311, 1, 5, 619448) Mr. Gokhale cultivated this religion to the highest level to the point where he laid down his life in the service of the Motherland.
('15', 311, 2, 6, 619581) Mr. Gandhi dwelt in his own inimitable and impressive manner on two great qualities of Mr. Gokhale which should always go with patriotism: love of truth and fearlessness.
('15', 311, 2, 7, 619752) Whilst most people expressed opinions which would be palatable to the hearers, Mr. Gokhale always gave to the officials and the public the result of his mature studies and deliberation.
('15', 311, 3, 8, 619938) Mr. Gandhi advised all officials, high or low, to take a leaf from the career of Mr. Gokhale who, though highly placed in life as a member of the Imperial Legislative Council, was always kind and gentle towards all his fellow countrymen.
('15', 311, 3, 9, 620176) Mr. Gandhi remarked that the feeling of patriotism which pervaded thousands of men, young and old, was running to waste like the river Ganges, which flowed from the Himalayas into the Bay of Bengal, for want of the sterling qualities of truthfulness and fearlessness.
('15', 311, 4, 10, 620444) Finally, Mr. Gandhi urged the people of the city to support energetically the Committee which had been appointed to further the cause of education in the district and thanked all who had given him such a magnificent and hearty welcome to the city.

('15', 311, 6, 13, 620769) February 23, 1917
('15', 311, 7, 14, 620787) Seeing sister Sarojini 2 today, I was reminded of Lord Colin Campbell who came out to India as Commander in Chief at the time of the Mutiny in 1857. In those days, military officers used camels very freely for transporting luxury articles and they were not available in sufficient number for carrying provisions, etc.
('15', 311, 7, 15, 621105) Lord Colin Campbell, therefore, kept only one camel for himself and thus tacitly

('15', 312, 1, 2, 621438) reminded the other officers of their duty.
('15', 312, 1, 3, 621481) This had the effect of reducing in some measure the discontent among the troops.
('15', 312, 1, 4, 621562) Though Sarojini travels first class, the luggage she carries is contained in just two boxes.
('15', 312, 1, 5, 621655) I have observed her life at home and come to respect her for that.
('15', 312, 1, 6, 621722) She has had four children, the youngest being now 13. At present, therefore, she lives very nearly like one in the vanaprastha 1
('15', 312, 2, 7, 621851) stage of life.
('15', 312, 2, 8, 621866) Though a millionaires daughter and a millionaires wife, she runs her house with great skill.
('15', 312, 2, 9, 621959) She yearns for one thing only, lndias advance.
('15', 312, 2, 10, 622006) If she has lashed out at us, it is to urge us to strive for perfection.
('15', 312, 2, 11, 622078) Hindus and Muslims are the same to her.
('15', 312, 2, 12, 622118) English has almost become her mother tongue.
('15', 312, 2, 13, 622163) But she believes we shall make no progress unless Indian languages come into their own.
('15', 312, 2, 14, 622251) Let us purge ourselves of all our weaknesses and make her lofty ideals our own.

('15', 312, 6, 18, 622406) February 26, 1917
('15', 312, 7, 19, 622424) SISTERS AND BROTHERS, It is obvious that I, a resident of Ahmedabad, can have no knowledge of civic affairs in Surat.
('15', 312, 7, 20, 622542) When I arrived here, it was suggested to me that I should take the chair.
('15', 312, 7, 21, 622616) I was rather surprised.
('15', 312, 7, 22, 622640) I felt that I was not the proper person to do so.
('15', 312, 7, 23, 622690) As I knew little about the civic affairs here, I respected the suggestion of local friends and told them that they could put forward my name if my taking the chair would help matters.
('15', 312, 7, 24, 622874) I am quite conscious of my responsibility.
('15', 312, 7, 25, 622917) I cannot claim, moreover, that I have come here prepared for the matters to be debated and the resolutions to be passed.
('15', 312, 7, 26, 623038) This is why I feel I am not the proper person.
('15', 312, 7, 27, 623085) I shall request you all, sisters and brothers, to overlook any deficiency that you may observe in me.
('15', 312, 7, 28, 623187) Before I start the proceedings, I shall deliver Mrs. Sarojini Naidus message.
('15', 312, 7, 29, 623265) When she was in Ahmedabad, I told her it would be good if she could go to Surat.
('15', 312, 7, 30, 623346) But she said she had an important engagement on Sunday.
('15', 312, 7, 31, 623402) Later, there was a telegram from Dr. Hora and I told her
('15', 312, 8, 32, 623459) 1 The third of the four stages of life, when one prepares for complete renunciation 2 The meeting was held under the auspices of the District Association
('15', 313, 0, 1, 623613) 314 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 313, 1, 2, 623655) again that Surat should not feel disappointed and asked her to come along.
('15', 313, 1, 3, 623730) I also found out from her the nature of her engagement to see if I could urge her to come.
('15', 313, 1, 4, 623821) The lady has been in bad health for several years past.
('15', 313, 1, 5, 623877) She has such strength of mind, however, and such is her love for the motherland, that, when occasion demands, she makes it possible to meet it.
('15', 313, 1, 6, 624021) God alone knows from where she gets the strength, but she who looked worn out just a moment earlier betrays no signs of suffering on her face when she is at work.
('15', 313, 1, 7, 624184) So wonderful is her strength.
('15', 313, 1, 8, 624214) There is to be a big meeting in Bombay on the 27th and she must conserve her health to be able to make a complete success of it.
('15', 313, 1, 9, 624343) As her coming to Surat would have made this impossible, she did not know how to manage it.
('15', 313, 1, 10, 624434) Even so, we should make every sacrifice and agitate on this issue; if for no other reason, out of consideration for this lady who, an ornament to India, goes up and down all over the country taking no thought of her health.
('15', 313, 1, 11, 624658) There is no religion among us which does not forbid our undertaking a second task before we have completed the first.
('15', 313, 1, 12, 624776) You have come forward at this meeting to take upon yourself a great responsibility.
('15', 313, 1, 13, 624860) But one has no right to assume an additional burden before one has fully discharged a duty already undertaken.
('15', 313, 1, 14, 624971) What I have in mind is this: I was here last year and you promised to collect a fund for the saint like Gokhale.
('15', 313, 1, 15, 625084) I have heard nothing further about it.
('15', 313, 1, 16, 625123) Mr. Adwani put down Rs. 50/ and the matter never went beyond that.
('15', 313, 1, 17, 625190) I met him in Godhra but did not have the courage to mention the subject to him.
('15', 313, 1, 18, 625270) It is not yet too late for you to raise something for the fund, though, of course, collections for the Fund in the charge of Mr. Jehangir Petit are over.
('15', 313, 1, 19, 625424) I think even the Trust Deed in respect of that Fund is ready.
('15', 313, 1, 20, 625486) It is still open to you, however, to send contributions to the Servants of India Society.
('15', 313, 1, 21, 625576) And so everyone should pay, each according to his means.
('15', 313, 1, 22, 625633) Perhaps Surat, the object of Narmadashankers 1 praises, thought that it would either pay in thousands or nothing.
('15', 313, 1, 23, 625747) But I would say that, if you subscribe Rs. 100/ this time, you will be able to pay Rs. 1,000/ next time.
('15', 313, 1, 24, 625852) The matter is important for this reason: Mrs. Naidu has been sacrificing herself for the cause.
('15', 313, 1, 25, 625948) Besides, Mahatma Gokhale was drawn into it in 1896 and in 1912 he made the cause his own.
('15', 313, 1, 26, 626038) I know also that his speeches at the time affected his health.
('15', 313, 1, 27, 626101) You should, therefore remind yourselves of your promise to raise a fund in memory of this man who had even sacrificed his life for this cause, and give to it to the best
('15', 313, 2, 28, 626271) 1 A Gujarati poet also called Narmad

('15', 314, 1, 2, 626350) of your means.
('15', 314, 1, 3, 626365) The gentleman who proposed me [to the chair] said that, of the two questions, that concerning volunteers [for the Army] was the more important one.
('15', 314, 1, 4, 626513) I shall say, though, that the question of in denture is more important.
('15', 314, 1, 5, 626585) It is of course right that we express satisfaction over the right of offering ourselves as volunteers, but the satisfaction will avail us nothing unless we follow up the expression of it with necessary action.
('15', 314, 1, 6, 626795) In regard to the issue of indenture, on the other hand, it is our unceasing duty to see that no town or village, known or unknown, goes without a protest against this system.
('15', 314, 1, 7, 626970) You know that I have come from Delhi.
('15', 314, 1, 8, 627008) I have had meetings with His Excellency the Viceroy and other leaders of the nation.
('15', 314, 1, 9, 627093) Like Mrs. Sarojini Naidu and the late Mr. Gokhale, Mr. Andrews too has made sacrifices.
('15', 314, 1, 10, 627181) As he pondered over this problem, he was so upset in mind that he took ill.
('15', 314, 1, 11, 627257) Even his speech, which has been translated into every language, had to be read out by Mr. Polak.
('15', 314, 1, 12, 627354) We should now hold public meetings for the purpose.
('15', 314, 1, 13, 627406) We do not at all embarrass the Government by doing so; on the contrary, we strengthen its hands.
('15', 314, 1, 14, 627503) The Government itself has admitted that the system is immoral and brings no benefit whatever.
('15', 314, 1, 15, 627597) Possibly there is some economic gain but, in view of the moral degradation it has brought about, it must be ended.
('15', 314, 1, 16, 627712) This is an issue on which there is no difference of opinion.
('15', 314, 1, 17, 627773) The Editor of The Times of India asks who should solve this problem and when.
('15', 314, 1, 18, 627851) Pat will come the reply: that is exclusively Indias right.
('15', 314, 1, 19, 627910) On this matter, we can imagine things far more vividly than the Viceroy.
('15', 314, 1, 20, 627983) I shall give only one illustration of this.
('15', 314, 1, 21, 628027) The worthy Baji Gauri is ill and her younger sister has been attending on her and has suffered in health in consequence.
('15', 314, 1, 22, 628148) I, as a resident of Ahmedabad, will not feel this as much as people here, and none will feel as much as the younger sister.
('15', 314, 1, 23, 628272) If it were otherwise, I would be by her bed side all the time.
('15', 314, 1, 24, 628335) In the same way, the Viceroy cannot imagine as well as we can the condition of our own brothers and sisters.
('15', 314, 1, 25, 628444) We should lay down a time limit and say that we would tolerate the system up to May 31 and that, if it continued even a day longer, thousands will lay down their lives.
('15', 314, 1, 26, 628613) The system has been in existence for fifty years.
('15', 314, 1, 27, 628663) It is a matter of shame for us that, in all these years, it is only recently that we have taken up discussion of a resolution like this.
('15', 314, 1, 28, 628800) I do not, however, wish to go into that matter.
('15', 314, 1, 29, 628848) I have had 20 years, experience of this problem and it is but natural, therefore, that my heart should cry out before you and my imagination grow active; I hope you will forgive me if I set out these things before you at such length.
('15', 314, 1, 30, 629082) The system is but a
('15', 315, 0, 1, 629102) 316 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 315, 1, 2, 629144) form 1 of slavery.
('15', 315, 1, 3, 629163) We have in it, under the British Empire, elements of the very system which England claims proudly to have abolished; this system can be described as slavery for a limited period.
('15', 315, 1, 4, 629342) All the essential elements of the earlier system are present in this, and one more.
('15', 315, 1, 5, 629426) It makes one shudder to know all.
('15', 315, 1, 6, 629460) The system brings Indias womanhood to utter ruin, destroys all sense of modesty.
('15', 315, 1, 7, 629541) That in defence of which millions in this country have laid down their lives in the past is lost under it.
('15', 315, 1, 8, 629648) I am not here to excite your feelings.
('15', 315, 1, 9, 629687) Mr. Andrews can be far more effective in that way than I. He has given quite a vivid picture.
('15', 315, 1, 10, 629781) I wish that, when you read the literature on this subject which I have here, you feel as excited as I do.
('15', 315, 1, 11, 629887) I pray for Smt.
('15', 315, 1, 12, 629903) Baji Gauri again; may God help her to a speedy recovery.
('15', 315, 1, 13, 629960) However, her suffering is nothing as compared to that of our sisters beyond the seas.
('15', 315, 1, 14, 630046) If, to our misfortune, Baji Gauris atman should leave her body, it would have ascended to a higher existence.
('15', 315, 1, 15, 630156) But which astronomer here, in this hall, can predict the future of the thousands of her sisters who suffer moral degradation?
('15', 315, 1, 16, 630282) Every one of us has it in him to treat this disease.
('15', 315, 1, 17, 630335) We should be ready to sacrifice our all to that end.
('15', 315, 1, 18, 630388) We should respectfully tell the Viceroy that the practice must be abolished before May 31. Let us take a pledge today that we will not suffer the thing beyond that date.
('15', 315, 1, 19, 630558) I shall close this chapter here.
('15', 315, 1, 20, 630591) I confess myself ignorant in the matter of the right of joining as volunteers.
('15', 315, 1, 21, 630670) When I first took up the issue, I wondered why India had been denied this right.
('15', 315, 1, 22, 630751) Perhaps we did not deserve it.
('15', 315, 1, 23, 630782) The right is now ours.
('15', 315, 1, 24, 630805) Today, the educated class in India understands my ideas.
('15', 315, 1, 25, 630862) I am entirely opposed to fighting with arms.
('15', 315, 1, 26, 630907) I have no faith in the thing.
('15', 315, 1, 27, 630937) Possession of arms for our or others defence will serve no useful purpose; nor have we the requisite strength.
('15', 315, 1, 28, 631048) I believe that, in place of the strength of a Kshatriya pitted against an armed opponent, soul force will prove far more potent.
('15', 315, 1, 29, 631177) There was a great British warrior, General Gordon by name.
('15', 315, 1, 30, 631236) The man who drew his portrait has won high praise [for his work].
('15', 315, 1, 31, 631302) He put into Gordons hand neither a sword nor a gun, but only a stick: I would even say that, had the painter drawn him with folded hands and put light in his eyes, on the lips and the entire face, to suggest that the whole world could not shake him from his purpose, that would have been the true Kshatriya character.
('15', 315, 1, 32, 631620) Such are my views, but all do not find them acceptable.
('15', 315, 2, 33, 631676) 1 Literally, a shadow

('15', 316, 1, 2, 631740) Some of them have little use for these views and others perhaps do not have the strength to follow them in practice.
('15', 316, 1, 3, 631857) In this matter, your duty is [not to run away from an enemy] 1; it will be a grave lapse if you do, saying in excuse ahimsa paramo dharmah 2. You wish destruction of your enemy some way or other.
('15', 316, 1, 4, 632053) Because you cherish belief in non violence, it does not mean that you are effectively observing the rule, for in that rule there is no place for running away in fear.
('15', 316, 1, 5, 632220) It is your duty to defend those among the Indian people who want themselves, their women, their moral standards and their wealth to be defended.
('15', 316, 1, 6, 632365) How to do this?
('15', 316, 1, 7, 632381) Those who have no faith in the principle which is dear to me and which I embrace may certainly take up arms.
('15', 316, 1, 8, 632490) It is for this reason that I welcome the right of enlisting as volunteers which has been granted to us.
('15', 316, 1, 9, 632594) I shall advise the people in this hall to join up.
('15', 316, 1, 10, 632645) If anyone asks me whether he would be offered a commission or not, I would tell him to reserve such grumbling for the future, and not be too particular for the present and so miss the opportunity offered.
('15', 316, 1, 11, 632850) Let us tell the Government that we are ready.
('15', 316, 1, 12, 632896) That will be worthy of us.
('15', 316, 1, 13, 632923) I now request Advocate Mr. Bejanji to move the first resolution.
('15', 316, 2, 14, 632988) Concluding, Gandhiji said: Before dissolving the meeting, I thank you and the organisers.
('15', 316, 2, 15, 633078) One thing more: I wanted to make a suggestion concerning collections for the Gokhale Fund, a suggestion which I have made elsewhere.
('15', 316, 2, 16, 633211) Those who are ready to work as volunteers for this purpose should now post themselves at the gate, and anyone who wants to pay something may give it to them.
('15', 316, 2, 17, 633369) If this is done, the credit for it will go to Surat.
('15', 316, 2, 18, 633422) I have with me the resolution 3 of which Mr. Thakoreram wanted a translation.
('15', 316, 2, 19, 633500) I shall send the translation on to him and he can publish it with necessary changes.

('15', 318, 2, 3, 635162) March 2, 1917
('15', 318, 3, 4, 635176) In the course of the day (2nd instant), Gandhi visited the Home Rule League Headquarters twice.
('15', 318, 3, 5, 635272) On both occasions he spoke to the members, associates and college students on passive resistance and austerity.
('15', 318, 3, 6, 635384) The love of dress, which Gandhi has noticed among Sindhis, has impressed him unfavourably.
('15', 318, 3, 7, 635475) One of the members asked him why he went about bare footed.
('15', 318, 3, 8, 635535) He replied that unless he maintained austerity, he could not expect the masses to believe in his sincerity.
('15', 318, 3, 9, 635643) He said that India was too poor and that those who could afford to spend money on dress should refrain from spending it in that way and give it to the poor.
('15', 318, 3, 10, 635800) Jethmal 1, of the Hindvasi, questioned him about passive resistance and Gandhi explained its value by examples from his South African experiences.
('15', 318, 4, 11, 635947) He also visited the Hardevi Bai Girls Schools and said a few words to the children on education.
('15', 318, 5, 12, 636044) He met the Cutchhi and Gujarati community at the Parsi Theatre in the afternoon and told them about indentured labour.

('15', 318, 8, 15, 636235) March 2, 1917
('15', 318, 9, 16, 636249) On his visit, Mr. Gandhi made a definite pronouncement with regard to the duty of Indians to join the Defence of India Force in the Parsi Theatre public meeting, Karachi.
('15', 318, 9, 17, 636420) He said that lndians had been pressing for admission in the army, time and again, and now as the permission had been granted, they should join in overwhelming numbers, and thus fulfil their duty to the Motherland.
('15', 318, 9, 18, 636634) Mr. Gandhi said that, in speaking as he had done, he had spoken not as a Passive Resister, but as one claiming to know the Indian mind and understanding Indias present conditions.
('15', 318, 9, 19, 636814) He held very strong views about the use of weapons even in self defence but he knew that his views were not shared by those of his countrymen who had for years past been agitating for the reform that had now come.
('15', 318, 9, 20, 637028) It is an opportunity of a life time that no lover of his country should miss.

('15', 319, 1, 2, 637537) laid stress firstly and chiefly on this point.
('15', 319, 1, 3, 637584) Sir Krishna Gupta exhorted Indians to first demand entrance in the army, and now as the door had been opened, if they did not avail themselves of this golden opportunity, they would disgrace themselves, their leaders and their country.
('15', 319, 1, 4, 637820) Business men ought not to allow their business to stand in the way of their duty.
('15', 319, 1, 5, 637902) Rather, should they know that after all they would be protecting their own business in protecting their own country.
('15', 319, 1, 6, 638019) If the enemy took possession of their country, because they did not care or were unable to defend it, their business would pass.
('15', 319, 1, 7, 638148) In Mr. Gandhis opinion, this Bill 1 was the first instalment of swaraj, and if they rejected the Governments advances, they would be rejecting swaraj.
('15', 319, 1, 8, 638299) It should be accepted unconditionally.
('15', 319, 1, 9, 638338) It would be time enough, after the whole hearted acceptance of the scheme, to attack its defects and to purge it of them.

('15', 319, 4, 12, 638529) March 2, 1917
('15', 319, 5, 13, 638543) Under the auspices of the Citizens Association, Karachi, a public meeting was held in the Khalikdina Hall on the 2nd instant to protest against the continuance of the system of indentured labour.
('15', 319, 5, 14, 638739) The Honble Mr. Harchandrai, President of the Association, was in the chair....
('15', 319, 6, 15, 638818) M. K. Gandhi arrived after the time fixed and informed the audience that he could not attend throughout as he had to catch the mail train to Calcutta, having been invited by the Maharaja of Cassimbazar to be present in that city on the 6th instant.
('15', 319, 7, 16, 639067) After speaking in Hindi for half an hour, he left the Hall.
('15', 319, 8, 17, 639127) He began by requesting the assembly to send a telegram of condolence to A. M. Kachalia, who had just lost his nephew 2, and explained how much Mr. Kachalia had done for Indians in South Africa.
('15', 319, 8, 18, 639321) Gandhi then spoke on indentured labour.
('15', 319, 8, 19, 639361) After mentioning the various evils of the system, he told the audience that Indians must insist on its abolition by the 31st of May this year.
('15', 319, 8, 20, 639504) If their request were not acceded to, all practical steps should be taken to prevent Indians from leaving the country for labour in Fiji.
('15', 319, 8, 21, 639642) Every effort should be made to teach the people to hate the system and to clamour for its suppression.

('15', 320, 2, 3, 639931) March 6, 1917
('15', 320, 3, 4, 639945) At a public meeting held at the Town Hall, Calcutta, on March 6, 1917, under the presidentship of Maharaja Manindra Chandra Nandi, Gandhiji made a statement on indentured emigration to South Africa.
('15', 320, 4, 5, 640144) Mr. M. K. Gandhi, in seconding the resolution moved by the chair, said they all expressed their sympathy to Mahomed Kachalia who had recently lost his son.
('15', 320, 4, 6, 640300) Mr. Kachalia was the president of the Transvaal British Indian Association.
('15', 320, 4, 7, 640376) He was one of the passive resisters and went to jail again and again.
('15', 320, 4, 8, 640446) Mr. Gandhi said that the Government did not allow Mr. Malaviya to introduce his Bill because the Government wanted to introduce a measure which would satisfy the people.
('15', 320, 4, 9, 640616) They all knew that the Viceroy was in sympathy with them, but the Secretary of State for India was opposed to them.
('15', 320, 4, 10, 640732) He was to weigh the interests of Colonial planters at [the cost?] of the Indians in a scale of gold.
('15', 320, 4, 11, 640833) Sitting at a long distance, the Secretary of State could not understand the feeling of the Indians.
('15', 320, 4, 12, 640933) India believed that Mr. Andrews report 1 was true.
('15', 320, 4, 13, 640984) The planters had engaged their best men to go to England and they were pressing for time.
('15', 320, 4, 14, 641074) If India did not rise to the occasion, the planters would gain the day.
('15', 320, 4, 15, 641146) It was not the Secretary of State for India but the people who could say when this system should be abolished and they fixed the 31st May for its abolition.
('15', 320, 4, 16, 641303) They could not contemplate with calmness the shifting of dates from season to season.
('15', 320, 4, 17, 641389) It was their duty to say that India could not tolerate this wrong a minute longer than the 31st May.
('15', 320, 4, 18, 641490) No substitute to be brought forward by the London Conference was acceptable to India.

('15', 321, 7, 11, 642495) MANILAL, You must have by now grown an old hand there.
('15', 321, 7, 12, 642550) Medh 2 and Pragji will be with you in a few days so that you will feel the atmosphere of India for some time longer yet.
('15', 321, 7, 13, 642671) Do not worry yourself but at the same time take proper treatment for your cough.
('15', 321, 7, 14, 642752) By way of treatment, deep breathing and a teaspoonful of olive oil will suffice.
('15', 321, 7, 15, 642833) You will be able to increase the quantity by and by.
('15', 321, 7, 16, 642886) It can be taken as it is, mixed with a tomato.
('15', 321, 7, 17, 642933) If you can give up tea, coffee and cocoa, that will help all the more in getting rid of the cough completely.
('15', 321, 7, 18, 643043) Think carefully about these things and carry them out.
('15', 321, 7, 19, 643098) Do not neglect deep breathing for any reason.
('15', 321, 7, 20, 643144) Keep up your studies in the way 1 have shown you.
('15', 321, 7, 21, 643194) Do not give up doing sums on any account.
('15', 321, 7, 22, 643236) A few must be done every day.
('15', 321, 7, 23, 643266) I would advise you not to pass over any, believing that you know the method.
('15', 321, 7, 24, 643343) As you do more and more sums, both of the simple and the difficult kind, you will grow more proficient.
('15', 321, 7, 25, 643447) Do not be slack about them.
('15', 321, 7, 26, 643475) The same about Sanskrit, and finally, English.
('15', 321, 7, 27, 643522) In regard to this last, for the present ponder over what I have taught you from Ruskin.

('15', 323, 1, 6, 645666) While Mr. and Mrs. Polak travel on public business, they are anxious to locate their children in some hillside place where Mr. Polaks sister in law could find suitable company.
('15', 323, 1, 7, 645843) She is a stranger to India.

('15', 323, 7, 15, 646116) 251. OUR SYSTEM OF EDUCAT1ON
('15', 323, 8, 16, 646145) March, 24, 1917
('15', 323, 9, 17, 646161) It has become customary with us to judge whatever we do by Western standards.
('15', 323, 9, 18, 646239) We claim that oriental civilization is superior to the occidental, but our behaviour is contrary to what we say.
('15', 323, 9, 19, 646352) That is why the education of Indian children has become hybrid.
('15', 323, 9, 20, 646416) Our educational institutions do not produce heirs to the traditions of our saints and seers.
('15', 323, 9, 21, 646509) It is very sad.
('15', 323, 9, 22, 646525) I have been thinking on the matter for a long time and I put before the readers the conclusions to which I have come.
('15', 323, 9, 23, 646643) No one will quarrel with the principle that pupils should be imparted a general knowledge of the basic occupations of the country.
('15', 323, 9, 24, 646774) According to this principle, all our boys should be taught farming and weaving, for nearly 95 per cent of the countrys population is engaged in agriculture, while 90 per cent of these used to be engaged in weaving.
('15', 323, 9, 25, 646989) So long as the educated among us do not pay attention to these two important matters, we cannot have any idea of the misery of our
('15', 324, 0, 1, 647120) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 325
('15', 324, 1, 2, 647162) tens of millions of agriculturists and hundreds of thousands of weavers, nor can there be any improvement in these two pursuits.
('15', 324, 1, 3, 647291) We shall not be able to do any work if our body is not healthy.
('15', 324, 1, 4, 647355) So it is necessary to educate boys in the principles of health and hygiene right from childhood.
('15', 324, 1, 5, 647452) Dharma is the basis of everything.
('15', 324, 1, 6, 647487) A correct knowledge of the scriptures, however, is not possible without a knowledge of Sanskrit.
('15', 324, 1, 7, 647584) Therefore, every Hindu boy must also learn some Sanskrit.
('15', 324, 1, 8, 647642) But I think it is very difficult to establish gurukuls everywhere.
('15', 324, 1, 9, 647709) General education should end with the imparting of general knowledge.
('15', 324, 1, 10, 647779) Special arrangements can be made for boys who are endowed with extraordinary capacities.
('15', 324, 1, 11, 647868) In teaching history and geography, the method followed by the Government should be changed.
('15', 324, 1, 12, 647960) In teaching these subjects, the emphasis should generally be on knowledge concerning India.
('15', 324, 1, 13, 648052) My experience is that many a boy knows where Middlesex is but he has no idea about Kathiawar or Sorath.
('15', 324, 1, 14, 648156) In history they are given a comprehensive knowledge of the United Kingdom, but our Shivaji they consider merely a bandit.
('15', 324, 1, 15, 648278) Our boys can solve intricate mathematical problems but are ignorant of simple arithmetic useful in business.
('15', 324, 1, 16, 648387) They have very little knowledge of the indigenous tables.
('15', 324, 1, 17, 648445) Instruction to pupils in all provinces should be given in their mother tongue.
('15', 324, 1, 18, 648524) Besides this, they should acquire knowledge of two or three other Indian languages.
('15', 324, 1, 19, 648608) English should be taught only to a small number of boys and as a foreign language.
('15', 324, 1, 20, 648691) I am convinced that so long as we are not free of our fondness for English, we cannot achieve real swaraj.
('15', 324, 1, 21, 648798) Some friends tell me that in the ordinary business of life, like travelling by train or reading a telegram, we are at sea if we do not know English.
('15', 324, 1, 22, 648947) But we ourselves are responsible for this state of affairs.
('15', 324, 1, 23, 649007) If through a feeling of inferiority we ignore our religion, our serfdom will only become worse.
('15', 324, 1, 24, 649103) And millions of our brethren who are never likely to learn English will be reduced to slaves and an unbridgeable gulf will form between them and the English educated.
('15', 324, 1, 25, 649270) The education that is in vogue has no impact on our homes either, although as a rule the whole country should be influenced by the lives of students.
('15', 324, 1, 26, 649420) Even a little of perfume will spread its fragrance all round.
('15', 324, 1, 27, 649482) It should be so with the life of a student.
('15', 324, 1, 28, 649526) In my opinion, the

('15', 325, 4, 9, 650034) Having made the choice, you must be content to suffer.

('15', 325, 11, 24, 650756) Every mail day found me out of reach of the mail steamer.
('15', 325, 11, 25, 650814) And I was too preoccupied to anticipate the mail day.
('15', 325, 11, 26, 650868) The reason for this rush was the indenture question which took up all my energy.

('15', 334, 7, 8, 663366) MAGANLAL, I have already dropped you a postcard, which you will get along with this.
('15', 334, 7, 9, 663451) I wrote it immediately on receiving the order.
('15', 334, 7, 10, 663498) Since they have not yet arrested me, l am writing more in this.
('15', 334, 7, 11, 663562) It is literally true that I did not stop even to wash my face.
('15', 334, 7, 12, 663625) The Police Inspector [actually] said, You may wash your face, etc., before you send your reply, while I said to myself, I shall do so only after sending my reply. They arrested me when I was on my way to a village for carrying on the inquiry.
('15', 334, 7, 13, 663868) They then put me in a bullock cart and were taking me away.
('15', 334, 7, 14, 663928) A senior police officer met us on the way and served the order upon me.
('15', 334, 7, 15, 664000) At first he only said, The Collector wants you. I turned back saying nothing.
('15', 334, 7, 16, 664078) I have refused to leave the District.
('15', 334, 7, 17, 664116) The penalty for this crime is six months imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1,000. I am awaiting further developments.
('15', 334, 7, 18, 664231) Herewith the statement of accounts up to date.
('15', 334, 7, 19, 664278) Let Chhaganlal make the credit and debit entries accordingly.
('15', 334, 7, 20, 664340) I have given the necessary details.

('15', 334, 7, 23, 664466) I shall describe it to you when we meet.
('15', 334, 7, 24, 664507) It is less hot than there.
('15', 334, 7, 25, 664534) People are very poor.
('15', 334, 7, 26, 664556) What a sad plight for the region where Shri Ramachandra lived, enjoyed himself and performed deeds of valour!
('15', 334, 7, 27, 664666) To go to jail here under such circumstances is a great joy to me.
('15', 334, 7, 28, 664732) It suggests an auspicious outcome.
('15', 334, 7, 29, 664767) I wish your work goes on with double speed.

('15', 336, 11, 12, 667163) DEAR MR. MAFFEY 2, I have come to this district to learn for myself whether there is truth in the allegations of the ryots against the planters.
('15', 336, 11, 13, 667308) I saw the Secretary of the Planters Association and then the Commissioner of the Division 3, and sought their co operation.
('15', 336, 11, 14, 667432) Both politely rejected my advances and dissuaded me from my pursuit.
('15', 336, 11, 15, 667501) I could not accept their advice, and have been proceeding with my work.
('15', 336, 11, 16, 667573) The Magistrate has served upon me an order 4 asking me to leave the District.
('15', 336, 11, 17, 667651) The grounds for the order are such as I cannot subscribe to.
('15', 336, 11, 18, 667712) I have therefore been reluctantly obliged to disobey the order and tell the magistrate that I shall suffer the penalty for the breach.
('15', 336, 12, 19, 667847) My motive is national service and that, too, so long as it is consistent with humanitarian dictates.
('15', 336, 12, 20, 667948) I understand, because my South African work was considered to be humanitarian that I was awarded.

('15', 336, 12, 22, 668076) 6 So long as my humanitarian motive is questioned, so long must I remain undeserving of holding the medal.

('15', 337, 1, 2, 668469) I am therefore asking my people to return the medal to you, 1 and I shall feel honoured to receive it back if it is returned to me when my motive is no longer questioned.
('15', 337, 2, 3, 668640) As to the question itself, so far as I have been able to examine the evidence, given to me, it shows that the planters have successfully used the Civil and Criminal Courts and illegal force to enrich themselves at the expense of the ryots, and that the ryots are living under a reign of terror and that their property, their persons, and their minds are all under the planters heels.
('15', 337, 2, 4, 669024) One man graphically said to me: We belong to the planters, not to the Sircar 2. Thana 3 is nowhere, the planters are everywhere.
('15', 337, 2, 5, 669153) We take what they allow, and we keep what they permit. I had hoped that a deeper examination would have toned down the impression formed by me.
('15', 337, 2, 6, 669297) Had I been left free, I would have concluded my studies and placed the results at the disposal of the authorities.
('15', 337, 2, 7, 669412) I wish that His Excellency would consider the matter serious enough to have an independent inquiry made.
('15', 337, 2, 8, 669517) The local administration admit that they are sitting upon a mine so dangerous that they cannot tolerate my presence.
('15', 337, 2, 9, 669634) And yet they manage to be satisfied with the slow inquiry of a settlement officer.
('15', 337, 2, 10, 669717) Everything will depend upon swiftness and the proper choice of the members of the Committee of Inquiry.
('15', 337, 2, 11, 669821) This is the least that the ryots are entitled to.
('15', 337, 2, 12, 669871) Will you please place this before the Viceroy and ask for his forgiveness for sending such a long letter in the midst of many imperative calls upon his time.
('15', 337, 2, 13, 670029) The urgency of the matter is the sole excuse for this letter.

('15', 338, 3, 4, 670353) The programme of study should be gone through as if I was not imprisoned, that is 1. Villages should be visited systematically and notes of evidence of everyone examined should be taken.
('15', 338, 3, 5, 670540) 2. Where the party consents to sign the notes, his signature or thumb impression should be taken.
('15', 338, 3, 6, 670638) 3. Evidence should be taken even where the parties decline to sign.
('15', 338, 3, 7, 670706) Reason for refusal should be noted.
('15', 338, 3, 8, 670742) 4. Evidence of pleaders who had anything to do with the case of the ryots should be requested and it should be after the pattern suggested for Gorakh Babu 3. For this, evidence as many workers as would come forward should be taken.
('15', 338, 3, 9, 670974) It is to be wished that many workers who would come forward would not be deterred from pursuing their inquiry even though they may receive notice of removal.
('15', 338, 3, 10, 671132) They should quietly go to gaol if they are summoned and tried for disobedience.
('15', 338, 3, 11, 671212) I suggest that no defence be offered.
('15', 338, 3, 12, 671250) The ryots should be instructed definitely not to use violence whether regarding their own grievances or regarding imprisonment of those who may come to assist them.
('15', 338, 3, 13, 671415) But they can be and should be told that where they know they are being unjustly treated, that is, required to plant indigo when they need not, rather than go to law, they should simply refuse to plant indigo and if for so refusing they are imprisoned they should suffer imprisonment.
('15', 338, 3, 14, 671699) This requires very careful explanation.
('15', 338, 3, 15, 671739) Where the workers do not understand the working of this quiet resistance or do not appreciate the force of it, they may drop this point of the programme.
('15', 338, 3, 16, 671893) When the workers of this first class are exhausted or not found at all, second class workers should be enlisted to collect evidence at

('15', 339, 1, 4, 672506) All documents should be collected and classified.
('15', 339, 1, 5, 672556) The work ought not to take more than six weeks.
('15', 339, 1, 6, 672604) At the end of the inquiry the whole of the evidence oral or documentary should be printed for private circulation.
('15', 339, 1, 7, 672719) In the first instance if no one will print it, it should be typed.
('15', 339, 1, 8, 672786) All the papers and evidence should be collected at one spot and sifted and mars halled under one mans direction.

('15', 339, 1, 10, 672996) Further action should be taken after consultation with a small all India committee under Panditjee 2 or Mr. Shastri 3. There should be a demand for an impartial inquiry containing a number (equal with that of the planters representatives) of Indians representing the ryots.
('15', 339, 1, 11, 673270) Our representatives must be of our choice.
('15', 339, 1, 12, 673313) Pending inquiry planters should institute no civil suits for damages, etc., and an impartial person should be present at the time of distribution of wages daily or otherwise.
('15', 339, 1, 13, 673488) Workers should be paid where necessary.
('15', 339, 1, 14, 673528) If funds cannot be raised locally, the Imperial Citizenship Association should be asked.

('15', 340, 3, 8, 674659) The authorities do not want me.
('15', 340, 3, 9, 674691) They have asked me to leave.

('15', 340, 3, 11, 674733) I am therefore to be tried for contempt.
('15', 340, 3, 12, 674774) 1 You will not hear from me now for some months, perhaps.
('15', 340, 3, 13, 674832) I have asked Chhaganlal 2 to write to you.

('15', 340, 8, 22, 675138) I am recalling the best days of South Africa.
('15', 340, 8, 23, 675184) And to have them in a place where Rama and Janaka lived!
('15', 340, 8, 24, 675241) The people are rendering all assistance.
('15', 340, 8, 25, 675282) We shall soon find our Naidoos 3 and Sorabjis 4 and Imams 5. I dont know that we shall stumble upon a Cachalia 6. I am still without the necessary summons for contempt.

('15', 341, 1, 2, 675765) I sent you last night the papers to your Allahabad address.
('15', 341, 1, 3, 675825) The papers ought to have gone to Bankipore last night.
('15', 341, 1, 4, 675880) But they did not somehow.
('15', 341, 1, 5, 675906) I am now sending you a special messenger.
('15', 341, 1, 6, 675948) Please show them to Muzharul Haque 1 too.
('15', 341, 1, 7, 675990) He has telegraphed offering to come if required.
('15', 341, 1, 8, 676039) I have replied saying he may come after my imprisonment.
('15', 341, 1, 9, 676096) Whilst I am free, I want only volunteers who will go from village to village and hear what the people have to say.
('15', 341, 2, 10, 676211) From the memorandum of instructions 2 hurriedly drawn up last night you will observe what is wanted.
('15', 341, 2, 11, 676312) Two things may be done by the leaders there: urgent demand for an impartial quick inquiry, a body of staunch learned volunteers (100) who would go to different villages and live there protecting the people from molestation and gathering information.
('15', 341, 2, 12, 676562) If the authorities object to the volunteers, they should not take no for an answer.
('15', 341, 2, 13, 676646) The volunteers should be, so far as possible, Beharees.
('15', 341, 2, 14, 676702) Theirs should be the credit.
('15', 341, 3, 15, 676731) I still feel that so far as you are concerned, you need not throw yourself into the fray.
('15', 341, 3, 16, 676821) I have asked Andrews to come.
('15', 341, 3, 17, 676851) I want you to feel free and prepared to go to England and settle there.
('15', 341, 3, 18, 676923) I cannot go into all the reasons just now.
('15', 341, 4, 19, 676966) Gorakh Prasad Babu here will give you all the information during my absence.
('15', 341, 4, 20, 677043) If there is no summons I disappear in the villages tomorrow and may not return for two days.

('15', 342, 3, 10, 678107) If you want me to choose for you seeing that you are here, your natural place is not to quit the place until the ryots have their freedom to breathe like men.

('15', 342, 3, 12, 678303) Every days inquiry confirms me in my opinion that the position in many respects is worse than in Fiji.

('15', 344, 2, 3, 680414) [MOTIHARI,] April 18, 1917
('15', 344, 3, 4, 680441) Mr. Gandhi appeared before the District Magistrate on Wednesday, the 18th instant.
('15', 344, 3, 5, 680524) He read the statement printed below, and being asked to plead and finding that the case was likely to be unnecessarily prolonged, pleaded guilty.
('15', 344, 3, 6, 680670) The Magistrate would not award the penalty but postponed judgement till 3 p.m.
('15', 344, 3, 7, 680749) Meanwhile he was asked to see the Superintendent and then the District Magistrate.
('15', 344, 3, 8, 680832) The result was that he agreed not to go out to the villages, pending instructions from the Government as to their view of his mission.
('15', 344, 3, 9, 680967) The case was then postponed up to Saturday, April 21.With the permission of the Court, I would like to make a brief statement showing why I have taken the very serious step of seemingly disobeying the order made under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
('15', 344, 3, 10, 681229) In my humble opinion, it is a question of difference of opinion between the local administration and myself.
('15', 344, 3, 11, 681338) I have entered the country with motives of rendering humanitarian and national service.
('15', 344, 3, 12, 681426) I have done so in response to a pressing invitation to come and help the ryots, who urge they are not being fairly treated by the indigo planters.
('15', 344, 3, 13, 681573) I could not render any help without studying the problem.
('15', 344, 3, 14, 681631) I have, therefore, come to study it with the assistance, if possible, of the administration and the planters.
('15', 344, 3, 15, 681741) I have no other motive and I cannot believe that my coming here can in any way disturb the public peace or cause loss of life.
('15', 344, 3, 16, 681868) I claim to have considerable experience in such matters.
('15', 344, 3, 17, 681925) The administration, however, have thought differently.
('15', 344, 3, 18, 681980) I fully appreciate their difficulty, and I admit too, that they can only proceed upon information they receive.
('15', 344, 3, 19, 682092) As a law abiding citizen, my first instinct would be, as it was, to obey the order served upon me.
('15', 344, 3, 20, 682191) I could not do so without doing violence to my sense of duty to those for whom I have come.
('15', 344, 3, 21, 682283) I feel that I could just now serve them only by remaining in their midst.
('15', 344, 3, 22, 682357) I could not, therefore, voluntarily retire.
('15', 344, 3, 23, 682401) Amid this conflict of duty, I could only throw the responsibility of removing me from them on the administration.
('15', 344, 3, 24, 682515) I am fully conscious of the fact that a person, holding in the public life of India a position such as I do, has to be most careful in setting examples.
('15', 344, 3, 25, 682668) It is my firm belief that in the complex constitution

('15', 345, 1, 2, 682764) under which we are living, the only safe and honourable course for a self respecting man is, in the circumstances such as face me, to do what I have decided to do, that is, to submit without protest to the penalty of disobedience.
('15', 345, 1, 3, 682995) I have ventured to make this statement not in any way in extenuation of the penalty to be awarded against me, but to show that I have disregarded the order served upon me, not for want of respect for lawful authority, but in obedience of the higher law of our beingthe voice of conscience.

('15', 346, 7, 22, 685143) I have got word that Government officials have been asked to co operate with me fully.
('15', 346, 7, 23, 685230) 5 So it would seem that my having to go to jail has been postponed for the time being.

('15', 347, 1, 5, 686240) there is scarcity of fruit even in such a fertile land.

('15', 347, 2, 15, 686797) But I would not interfere.

('15', 351, 8, 14, 691743) DEAR MR. LEWIS 3, I have your note of even date.
('15', 351, 8, 15, 691792) I thank you for having sent me your letter 4 to Mr. Heycock for perusal, I appreciate the frankness that pervades it, and it is, on the whole, a very fair summary of what has happened between us.
('15', 351, 8, 16, 691988) As to the guns, I think you are somewhat unnecessarily offended.
('15', 351, 8, 17, 692053) I mentioned the matter to you on Mr. Heycocks suggestion, and if you admit the propriety of my having spoken to you about the matter, I could not be blamed for having told the aggrieved parties that there was a probability of their getting back their guns.
('15', 351, 8, 18, 692310) This, if anything, was done to create a good impression about yourself an impression which, I am happy to say, I carried with me [when] I first met you and which I have had no reason to

('15', 352, 1, 3, 692694) There was certainly no interference on my part with your authority.
('15', 352, 2, 4, 692762) I venture to think that your deduction, too, that in the estimation of the raiyats I am superseding local authority is hardly warranted by facts.
('15', 352, 2, 5, 692908) My mission is to invoke the help of local authority in their aid, and to stimulate its interest in them more fully than heretofore.
('15', 352, 3, 6, 693040) I anticipate no trouble, because I always make it a point to seek an interview with the planters wherever I go, to tell the people that relief is to come not from me but from the planters and the Government, and that they are in no case to use violence or stop work but continue it as before as if there was no enquiry being made by me, and also because the enquiry is absolutely open and attended by representatives of the police department, as also the planters.
('15', 352, 4, 7, 693505) You are less than fair to Babu Brajkishore Prasad.
('15', 352, 4, 8, 693556) Together with other friends from Bihar, he is helping me very materially.
('15', 352, 4, 9, 693630) In this enquiry he has no status apart from me: hence he and the other friends have not called on you.
('15', 352, 4, 10, 693733) But I must state that their assistance has been of the greatest value to me.
('15', 352, 5, 11, 693810) Perhaps it is but fair to the planters to say that Mr. Still 1 has of his own motion invited me to visit his dehat 2 and remain there aslong as I like and that Mr. Cox has written to me saying that he is arranging a meeting with some leading planters, and concludes you may be sure that we wish to assist you in your enquiry.
('15', 352, 5, 12, 694136) This perhaps is in conflict with your statement, By the planters he (I) is regarded with great suspicion as their natural enemy.
('15', 352, 6, 13, 694265) I wish to serve my countrymen and the planters through the Government where their assistance is necessary.

('15', 354, 1, 3, 695982) 1 Yes, I have felt anxious about him these months having heard nothing from or of him.
('15', 354, 1, 4, 696069) I have been writing most regularly to him.
('15', 354, 1, 5, 696112) He gave me, when his departure was imminent, his new address and I wrote several letters to that address.
('15', 354, 1, 6, 696218) Having received no acknowledgement of these letters I resumed writing to his Douglas address.
('15', 354, 1, 7, 696312) But I have practically no acknowledgment of all these letters of mine.
('15', 354, 1, 8, 696383) Pray tell him that we all think of him and miss him so often.
('15', 354, 1, 9, 696445) I miss him most of all.
('15', 354, 1, 10, 696469) Just now I am in the northern part of India.
('15', 354, 1, 11, 696514) It is a country Where every prospect pleases, man alone is vile. 2 Here at first my presence was resented by the local authority.
('15', 354, 1, 12, 696644) I received a summons to leave the country.
('15', 354, 1, 13, 696687) I declined.
('15', 354, 1, 14, 696699) I was summoned to answer a charge of contempt.
('15', 354, 1, 15, 696746) I pleaded guilty.
('15', 354, 1, 16, 696764) But the court had not the courage to sentence me.
('15', 354, 1, 17, 696814) Meanwhile came instructions from the superior authority that the proceedings against me should be withdrawn and that I should be allowed to proceed with my work.
('15', 354, 1, 18, 696976) My work is to examine the condition of the peasantry who are working under the indigo planters who are alleged to be treating the peasantry in a most high handed manner.
('15', 354, 1, 19, 697146) I have been carrying on my inquiry and I find the position to be as bad as it was painted.
('15', 354, 1, 20, 697237) I am still going on with the inquiry.
('15', 354, 1, 21, 697275) It is here I miss our friends presence.
('15', 354, 1, 22, 697315) I cannot imagine myself doing this class of work without him.
('15', 354, 1, 23, 697377) I know he would have been delighted to be in the thick of it.
('15', 354, 1, 24, 697439) He would have walked with me to the villages and lived with me among the simple folk.
('15', 354, 1, 25, 697525) He would have seen the planters.
('15', 354, 1, 26, 697558) He would have made friends with them and would have played an important part in bringing about a settlement.
('15', 354, 1, 27, 697667) But that was not to be.
('15', 354, 1, 28, 697691) He must pay the penalty that modern civilization exacts from us man against man to gain mans so called freedom.
('15', 354, 1, 29, 697803) It is like darkness being used to dispel darkness.
('15', 354, 1, 30, 697854) We are living in an age of materialism.
('15', 354, 1, 31, 697894) We are always hoping for the best to happen though unconsciously doing the opposite to achieve the best.
('15', 354, 1, 32, 697999) I hope with you that the agony will soon end.
('15', 354, 1, 33, 698045) But the hope is against my reason.
('15', 354, 1, 34, 698080) My reason tells me that the peace which we shall have will be mockery; it will be an armed truce to me, it will be the outcome not of one party admitting being in the wrong but both being fairly exhausted and deserving rest.
('15', 354, 1, 35, 698305) Such a peace is bound to

('15', 355, 1, 3, 698726) Whilst I write this setting on a stool in a hamlet, I am not forgetful of the distress you are passing through there.
('15', 355, 1, 4, 698844) We are only a glimpse of what you are going through.
('15', 355, 1, 5, 698897) I wish that all this great sacrifice had been made for a better cause.
('15', 355, 1, 6, 698968) But nature has her own ways.
('15', 355, 1, 7, 698997) Good often comes out of evil.
('15', 355, 1, 8, 699027) Let us hope it will in this case also.
('15', 355, 2, 9, 699066) I am glad our friend is flourishing so far as his bodily health goes.
('15', 355, 2, 10, 699136) Pray tell him not to worry over his South African affairs.
('15', 355, 2, 11, 699195) He left them in the best hands available and there they must rest.
('15', 355, 2, 12, 699262) The circumstances that will face him on his release will provide their own remedy.
('15', 355, 3, 13, 699345) I hope you will make sure of this reaching our friend even if it means your having to go to him.
('15', 355, 3, 14, 699442) If you will give me the privilege of paying for your journey, I should be gald to do so.
('15', 355, 4, 15, 699531) Now that you have commenced writing, I hope you will allow yourself to be the link between our friend and me.
('15', 355, 4, 16, 699641) Unless there is anything of importance I shall not write to you until I hear from you.
('15', 355, 4, 17, 699728) To make sure of this reaching you, I am having the letter sent by registeres post.
('15', 355, 5, 18, 699811) Thanking you most sincerely for having written to me about our friend.

('15', 356, 3, 6, 700244) Ahmedabad would be very hot these days.

('15', 357, 3, 5, 701501) To say I thank you would be in your case an empty form.
('15', 357, 3, 6, 701557) Your interest is much deeper.
('15', 357, 3, 7, 701587) My experiences here give the greatest joy.
('15', 357, 3, 8, 701630) The suffering I see around me gives me equal pain.
('15', 357, 3, 9, 701681) I know that you feel for me because you would like to be in the thick of it all yourself.
('15', 357, 3, 10, 701771) But your work is cut out for you.
('15', 357, 3, 11, 701805) For those who are at a distance from you, you can but pray.
('15', 357, 3, 12, 701865) And that you are doing with all your heart.
('15', 357, 3, 13, 701909) I may not be able to leave this place for six months.
('15', 357, 3, 14, 701963) One of these days, I shall describe to you the nature of the work I am doing here.
('15', 357, 3, 15, 702046) Do please go to the Ashram whenever you can.

('15', 357, 8, 22, 702313) BHAISHRI KAKA, I have your letter.
('15', 357, 8, 23, 702348) It is good you went over to the Ashram.
('15', 357, 8, 24, 702388) I may perhaps need you here 2 but I will not ask for your help.
('15', 357, 8, 25, 702452) Your work at present is to lose yourself in the National School experiment.

('15', 358, 1, 2, 702695) I think it is a very important experiment.
('15', 358, 1, 3, 702738) 1 should like you to see Prof.
('15', 358, 1, 4, 702769) Shah and start work immediately.
('15', 358, 1, 5, 702802) Write to Mr. Sadashiv to tell him that he may possibly be needed.
('15', 358, 1, 6, 702868) I will call him up then.
('15', 358, 1, 7, 702893) Is he ready to come along with his family?
('15', 358, 1, 8, 702936) He must give at least six months.
('15', 358, 1, 9, 702970) Perhaps more.
('15', 358, 2, 10, 702984) If Shastris plot is not otherwise inconvenient and the water there is good, it should be secured without any delay.
('15', 358, 2, 11, 703100) Do you think it will be possible to put up tents or thatched huts while Construction work is under way?
('15', 358, 2, 12, 703204) I dont care if the analysts report on the soil is not favourable.
('15', 358, 2, 13, 703270) The water must be good.
('15', 358, 2, 14, 703294) For the school, we want 12 to 20 pupils for the present.
('15', 358, 2, 15, 703351) It will be better if they are drawn from good families.
('15', 358, 2, 16, 703407) Rather, let them be what they are.
('15', 358, 2, 17, 703442) If it is decided to settle on Shastris plot, boys from adjoining villages may be invited.
('15', 358, 2, 18, 703532) However, so long as we can get them from Ahmedabad city, it will be preferable not to bring in villagers to join the experiment.
('15', 358, 2, 19, 703661) But one need not be particular in this matter; we should carry on with any boys who may join.
('15', 358, 3, 20, 703755) If the teacher has any real worth in him, the mechanical side of education will take care of itself.
('15', 358, 3, 21, 703856) If they tell stories from the Ramayana, everyone will follow them as well as he can.
('15', 358, 3, 22, 703941) In agriculture, they will acquire equal proficiency.
('15', 358, 3, 23, 703994) Spiritual awakening will require [a mind disposed that way through] early influences.
('15', 358, 3, 24, 704080) How can we know whether we shall come upon such influences in cities or villages?
('15', 358, 3, 25, 704162) Show this to Prof.
('15', 358, 3, 26, 704181) Shah and request him on my behalf to take up this work in all earnestness.
('15', 358, 3, 27, 704256) I shall write to him if I find time.
('15', 358, 4, 28, 704293) Kripalani is in Muzaffarpur.
('15', 358, 4, 29, 704322) He wanted to know from me what he should do.
('15', 358, 4, 30, 704367) I told him 1 that, since he was here, he should join in the work here.
('15', 358, 4, 31, 704438) There has been no reply from him.

('15', 359, 9, 18, 705384) DEAR MILLIE, Your letter and wire were redirected here and come into my hands today.
('15', 359, 9, 19, 705469) Henceforth, please write at the above address.
('15', 359, 9, 20, 705516) Simply Bettiah, Champaran will do.
('15', 359, 9, 21, 705551) I am sorry to hear the news about Henrys illness.
('15', 359, 9, 22, 705601) Somehow I do not share your gloomy forebodings.
('15', 359, 9, 23, 705649) He has marvellous recuperative powers and I think he will quickly recover his original vigour.
('15', 359, 9, 24, 705744) What I do feel, however, is that both of you should join Ceilia at Ooty.
('15', 359, 9, 25, 705817) Mama too wrote saying that Ceilia was not keeping well.
('15', 359, 9, 26, 705873) But I go further to say that even if she were well, she ought not alone to have charge of a child, especially a child so wonderful as Leon.
('15', 359, 9, 27, 706013) Ooty will do Henry good and may do you also good.
('15', 359, 9, 28, 706063) If the high altitude does not suit you all, you should go to Bangalore.
('15', 359, 9, 29, 706135) It has perhaps the finest climate in India.
('15', 359, 9, 30, 706179) Even Belgaum or Poona will be alright for

('15', 360, 1, 2, 706410) But somehow or other, I prefer Banglore.
('15', 360, 1, 3, 706451) Change to any such place will be the best tonic for Henry.
('15', 360, 1, 4, 706510) And he must live on the plainest foods such as we have at the Ashram.
('15', 360, 1, 5, 706580) Everything simply boiled.
('15', 360, 1, 6, 706606) As for Waldo, I must differ from your views.
('15', 360, 1, 7, 706651) It is because Waldo is a trust that you may not play with him.
('15', 360, 1, 8, 706714) I would not mind your being vaccinated if you chose to be.
('15', 360, 1, 9, 706773) But to add a weakness causing operation to an already weak constitution is to do infinite harm to it.
('15', 360, 1, 10, 706875) It is not obligatory on you to travel or to live in insanitary surroundings.
('15', 360, 1, 11, 706952) By all means take all reasonable precautions that the science of hygiene may suggest.
('15', 360, 1, 12, 707038) If the worst fear is realized and Waldo has smallpox, why should you consider yourself guilty?
('15', 360, 1, 13, 707133) It is not a dangerous disease.
('15', 360, 1, 14, 707164) And natural smallpox if properly treated does not leave the patient debilitated.
('15', 360, 1, 15, 707245) But the purest lymph is not as pure as you may imagine.
('15', 360, 1, 16, 707301) By having him vaccinated, you will expose Waldo to an additional risk to his health.
('15', 360, 1, 17, 707386) Pock marks, if you are afraid of them, are really nothing.
('15', 360, 1, 18, 707445) By proper treatment, in course of time they disappear.
('15', 360, 1, 19, 707500) Did you see Bala and Naransamy?
('15', 360, 1, 20, 707532) They had confluent smallpox of the most virulent type.
('15', 360, 1, 21, 707587) The marks are growing or were growing fainter daily under the treatment of anointing with oil and rubbing thereafter.
('15', 360, 1, 22, 707705) Pray read my plan for Waldo twice, then pray and then do as the voice within you bids you.
('15', 360, 1, 23, 707796) Do please write to me frequently if you cannot write to me daily about Henrys health.
('15', 360, 1, 24, 707882) It is Gods mercy that when every member of the family is down, you are keeping well.
('15', 360, 1, 25, 707967) I do hope you wont have a nervous breakdown after Henry rises from his sick bed which he will soon do, I am sure.
('15', 360, 1, 26, 708081) My work is steadily progressing.
('15', 360, 1, 27, 708114) I have come in touch with many planters too and often meet the collector, etc.
('15', 360, 1, 28, 708193) I cannot leave this place for some months to come.

('15', 361, 3, 4, 708560) MY DEAR MILLIE,
('15', 361, 4, 5, 708576) Just a line before leaving for Bettiah.
('15', 361, 4, 6, 708616) Your telegram of yesterday has frightened me.
('15', 361, 4, 7, 708662) Immediately on receipt of your wire, I wrote to you a long letter about Henry and Ceilia.
('15', 361, 4, 8, 708752) I do still hope that [you] have received it.
('15', 361, 4, 9, 708797) The postal hours in Bettiah are most inconvenient.
('15', 361, 4, 10, 708848) I have to trust to chance friends to post the letters and it is possible that the one who takes the letter might have missed the post for which my letter to you was intended.
('15', 361, 5, 11, 709023) It alarms me to find that fever has not yet left Henry and I have telegraphed to you to wire or write to me at Bettiah.
('15', 361, 6, 12, 709143) I came in yesterday on the invitation of the Government to see Honble Mr. Maude 2 .
('15', 361, 6, 13, 709227) I had two hours interview.
('15', 361, 6, 14, 709254) I shall write more about this later.
('15', 361, 6, 15, 709291) The matter is critical.
('15', 361, 6, 16, 709315) I dare not gone down to you.
('15', 361, 6, 17, 709344) Please use the wire freely if necessary.

('15', 362, 9, 17, 710349) I do hope you received my wire from Bankipore and I am sending another one just now.
('15', 362, 9, 18, 710434) How I wish I could be by Henrys side.
('15', 362, 9, 19, 710472) But it cannot be.
('15', 362, 9, 20, 710490) The position here is so serious that I dare not leave this place.
('15', 362, 9, 21, 710556) I had an important interview with a member of the Government.
('15', 362, 9, 22, 710618) I am preparing a general letter of which you shall have a copy.

('15', 363, 8, 9, 711424) JAMNADAS 2, I had been waiting for a letter from you, as one waits for the rains.
('15', 363, 8, 10, 711506) I got one and I am satisfied.
('15', 363, 8, 11, 711536) The same post brought a letter of yours sent on by Narandas.
('15', 363, 8, 12, 711597) I shall keep on writing to you.
('15', 363, 8, 13, 711629) I shall be measured by your success.
('15', 363, 8, 14, 711666) If you should not come up to my expectations, my judgment would be rated at zero; I have staked so much on you.
('15', 363, 8, 15, 711778) My conscience would also tell me that I am not at all a good judge of men.
('15', 363, 8, 16, 711853) You will therefore always have my blessings and my encouragement.
('15', 363, 8, 17, 711919) I pray God may give you all necessary strength.
('15', 363, 8, 18, 711967) If the two of you live an ideal life, you will be the saving of many a young man.
('15', 363, 8, 19, 712049) It is very much my desire that all of you, on whom I have placed my hopes, should be not merely what I am but free of all my faults, that you may do better than I. There will be nothing wrong in your aiming so high.
('15', 363, 8, 20, 712265) It is not much of a miracle that a son should preserve the capital, what pleases the father more and brings greater credit to himself is that he should add to it.
('15', 363, 8, 21, 712428) For some time yet I shall have no choice but to stay on here.
('15', 363, 8, 22, 712490) You must be getting all the news through Doctor Saheb, so I dont give any here.
('15', 363, 8, 23, 712570) If the food there does not disagree with you, be in no hurry to make too many changes in it.
('15', 363, 8, 24, 712663) Your duty at present is to see that you flourish in health and that you teach the boys and raise them

('15', 364, 6, 6, 713062) BETTIAH, May 13, 1917
('15', 364, 7, 7, 713084) MY DEAR ESTHER, Pray do not apologize for writing to me.
('15', 364, 7, 8, 713141) Your letters are most welcome.
('15', 364, 7, 9, 713172) I am sure that your duty is to fulfil your undertaking with the Mission with all your heart.
('15', 364, 7, 10, 713265) You can come to the Ashram only when they relieve you and when you feel in the clearest possible terms that you will come to render the service of humanity in greater fullness.
('15', 364, 7, 11, 713442) When that time comes, the Ashram will receive you as one of its own.
('15', 364, 7, 12, 713511) Meanwhile you are of course always free to go [to] the Ashram and stay there as long as you like.
('15', 364, 7, 13, 713609) At the Ashram, we are now trying an experiment in education to serve as a pattern.
('15', 364, 7, 14, 713692) When you go there, I am sure you will like the teaching staff.
('15', 364, 7, 15, 713755) They are all, I think, good men and sane.
('15', 364, 7, 16, 713797) My work here gives me greater and greater joy day by day.
('15', 364, 7, 17, 713855) The poor raiyats delight in simply sitting round me, feeling that they can trust me to do the right thing.
('15', 364, 7, 18, 713962) I only hope I am worthy of all this love.
('15', 364, 7, 19, 714004) I constantly see the planters and do not despair of appealing to their sense of justice on behalf of the raiyats who have groaned under the weight of oppression all these long years.
('15', 364, 7, 20, 714187) I shall send you a copy of my representation 1 to the Government.
('15', 364, 7, 21, 714253) You may not understand some points in it.
('15', 364, 7, 22, 714295) Do not hesitate to ask me please.

('15', 365, 2, 3, 714481) BETTIAH, May 13, 1917
('15', 365, 3, 4, 714503) In accordance with the suggestions made by Honble Mr. Maude 2, I beg to submit herewith the preliminary conclusions which I have arrived at as a result of the inquiry being made by me into the agrarian condition of the raiyats of Champaran.
('15', 365, 3, 5, 714744) At the outset I would like to state that it was not possible for me to give the assurance which Mr. Maude would have liked me to have given, viz., that the vakil friends who have been assisting me would be withdrawn.
('15', 365, 3, 6, 714961) I must confess that this request has hurt me deeply.
('15', 365, 3, 7, 715014) It has been made ever since my arrival here.
('15', 365, 3, 8, 715059) I have been told, that is, after the withdrawal of the order of removal from the District, that my presence was harmless enough and that my bona fides were unquestioned, but that the presence of the vakil friends was likely to create a dangerous situation.
('15', 365, 3, 9, 715316) I venture to submit that if I may be trusted to conduct myself decorously, I may be equally trusted to choose helpers of the same type as myself.
('15', 365, 3, 10, 715462) I consider it a privilege to have the association, in the difficult tasks before me, of these able, earnest and honourable men.
('15', 365, 3, 11, 715590) It seems to me that for me to abandon them is to abandon my work.
('15', 365, 3, 12, 715656) It must be a point of honour with me not to dispense with their help until anything unworthy is proved against them to my satisfaction.
('15', 365, 3, 13, 715792) I do not share the fear that either my presence or that of my friends can create a dangerous situation.
('15', 365, 3, 14, 715896) The danger, if any exists, must lie in the causes that have brought about strained relations between the planters and the raiyats.
('15', 365, 3, 15, 716027) And if the causes were removed, there never need be any fear of a dangerous situation arising in Champaran so far as the raiyats are concerned.
('15', 365, 3, 16, 716171) Coming to the immediate purpose of this representation, I beg to state that nearly four thousand raiyats have been examined and their statements taken after careful cross examination.
('15', 365, 3, 17, 716355) Several villages have been visited and many judgments of courts studied.
('15', 365, 3, 18, 716428) And the inquiry is, in my opinion, capable of sustaining the following
('15', 365, 4, 19, 716499) 1 This was sent to the Chief Secretary, Bihar & Orissa.
('15', 365, 4, 20, 716555) 2 Member of the Executive Council, Bihar & Orissa, in his talk with Gandhiji on 10th May; vide Note By Honble W. Maude on Interview with Gandhiji, 10 5 1917.
('15', 366, 0, 1, 716713) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 367
('15', 366, 1, 2, 716755) conclusions:
('15', 366, 2, 3, 716768) Factories or concerns in the district of Champaran may be divided into two classes(1) those that have never had indigo plantations, and (2) those that have:
('15', 366, 3, 4, 716925) (1) The concerns which have never grown indigo have exacted abwabs known by various local names equal in amount at least to the rent paid by the raiyats.
('15', 366, 3, 5, 717079) This exaction, although it has been held to be illegal, has not altogether stopped.
('15', 366, 4, 6, 717163) (2) The indigo growing factories have grown indigo either under the tinkathia system or khuski.
('15', 366, 4, 7, 717259) The former has been most prevalent and has caused the greatest hardship.
('15', 366, 4, 8, 717332) The type has varied with the progress of time.
('15', 366, 4, 9, 717379) Starting with indigo, it has taken in its sweep all kinds of crops.
('15', 366, 4, 10, 717447) It may now be defined as an obligation presumed to attach to the raiyats holding whereby the raiyat has to grow a crop on 3/20 of the holding at the will of the landlord for a stated consideration.
('15', 366, 4, 11, 717645) There appears to be no legal warrant for it.
('15', 366, 4, 12, 717690) The raiyats have always fought against it and have only yielded to force.
('15', 366, 4, 13, 717764) They have not received adequate consideration for the services.
('15', 366, 4, 14, 717828) When, however, owing to the introduction of synthetic indigo the price of the local product fell, the planters desired to cancel the indigo sattas 1. They, therefore, devised a means of saddling the losses upon the raiyats.
('15', 366, 4, 15, 718052) In lease hold lands they made the raiyats pay tawan, i.e., damages to the extent of Rs. 100/ per bigha in consideration of their waiving their right toindigo cultivation.
('15', 366, 4, 16, 718223) This, the raiyats claim, was done under coercion.
('15', 366, 4, 17, 718273) Where the raiyats could not find cash, hand notes and mortgage bonds were made for payment in instalments bearing interest at 12 per cent per annum.
('15', 366, 4, 18, 718422) In these the balance due has not been described as tawan, i.e., damages, but it has been fictitiously treated as an advance to the raiyat for some purpose of his own.
('15', 366, 5, 19, 718589) In mukarrari 2 lands, the damage has taken the shape of sharahbeshi sattas, meaning enhancement of rent in lieu of indigo cultivation.
('15', 366, 5, 20, 718724) The enhancement according to the survey report has in
('15', 366, 6, 21, 718778) 1 Agreements 2 A permanent tenure.
('15', 367, 0, 1, 718813) 368 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 367, 1, 2, 718855) the case of 5,955 tenancies amounted to Rs. 31,062, the pre enhancement figure being Rs. 53,865. The total number of tenancies affected is much larger.
('15', 367, 1, 3, 719007) The raiyats claim that these sattas were taken from them under coercion.
('15', 367, 1, 4, 719080) It is inconceivable that the raiyats would agree to an enormous perpetual increase in their rents against freedom from liability to grow indigo for a temporary period which freedom they were strenuously fighting to secure and hourly expecting.
('15', 367, 1, 5, 719324) Where tawan has not been exacted, the factories have forced the raiyats to grow oats, sugarcane, or such other crops under the tinkathia system.
('15', 367, 1, 6, 719469) Under the tinkathia system, the raiyat has been obliged to give his best land for the landlords crops; in some cases the land in front of his house has been so used; he has been obliged to give his best time and energy also to it, so that very little time has been left to him for growing his own cropshis means of livelihood.
('15', 367, 1, 7, 719796) Cart hire sattas have been forcibly taken from the raiyats for supplying carts to the factories on hire insufficient even to cover the actual outlay.
('15', 367, 1, 8, 719946) Inadequate wages have been paid to the raiyats whose labour has been impressed, and even boys of tender age have been made to work against their will.
('15', 367, 1, 9, 720097) Ploughs of the raiyats have been impressed and detained by the factories for days together for ploughing factory lands for a trifling consideration and at a time when they required them for cultivating their own lands.
('15', 367, 1, 10, 720316) Dasturi 1 has been taken by the notoriously ill paid factory amlas 2 out of the wages received by the labourers, often amounting to a fifth of their daily wage, and also out of the hire paid for carts and ploughs.
('15', 367, 1, 11, 720530) In some villages, the chamars 3 have been forced to give up to the factories the hides of dead cattle belonging to the raiyats.
('15', 367, 1, 12, 720658) Against the carcases the chamars used to supply the raiyats with shoes and leather straps for ploughs and their women used to render services to the latters families at child birth.
('15', 367, 1, 13, 720840) Now they have ceased to render

('15', 367, 2, 15, 720909) 2 Staff.

('15', 368, 1, 2, 721009) these valuable services.
('15', 368, 1, 3, 721034) Some factories have for the collection of such hides opened hides godowns.
('15', 368, 1, 4, 721109) Illegal finesoften of heavy amountshave been imposed by factories upon raiyats who have proved unbending.
('15', 368, 1, 5, 721215) Among the other (according to the evidence before me) methods adopted to bend the raiyats to their will, the planters have impounded the raiyats cattle, posted peons on their houses, withdrawn from them barbers, dhobis, carpenters, and smiths services; have prevented the use of village wells and pasture lands by ploughing up the pathway and lands just in front of or behind their homesteads, have brought or promoted civil suits, or criminal complaints against them, and resorted to actual physical force and wrongful confinements.
('15', 368, 1, 6, 721749) The planters have successfully used the institutions of the country to enforce their will against the raiyats and have not hesitated to supplement them by taking the law in their own hands.
('15', 368, 1, 7, 721939) The result has been that the raiyats have shown an abject helplessness such as I have not witnessed in any part of India where I have travelled.
('15', 368, 2, 8, 722084) They are members of District Boards and assessors under the Chaukidari Act and keepers of pounds.
('15', 368, 2, 9, 722182) Their position as such has been felt by the raiyats.
('15', 368, 2, 10, 722235) The roads which the latter pay for at the rate of half an anna per rupee of rent paid by them are hardly available to them.
('15', 368, 2, 11, 722359) Their carts and bullocks which perhaps most need the roads are rarely allowed to make use of them.
('15', 368, 2, 12, 722458) That this is not peculiar to Champaran does not in any way mitigate the grievance.
('15', 368, 3, 13, 722541) I am aware that there are concerns which form exceptions to the rule laid down, but as a general charge the statements made above are capable of proof.
('15', 368, 4, 14, 722693) I am aware, too, that there are some Indian zamindars who are open to the charges made above.
('15', 368, 4, 15, 722787) Relief is sought for in their cases as in those of the planters.
('15', 368, 4, 16, 722852) Whilst there can be no doubt the latter have inherited a vicious system, they with their trained minds and superior position have reduced it to an exact science, so that the raiyats would not only have been unable to raise their heads above water but would have sunk deeper still had not the Government granted some protection.
('15', 368, 4, 17, 723180) But that protection has been meagre and provokingly slow and has often come too late to be appreciated by the raiyats.
('15', 369, 0, 1, 723299) 370 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 369, 1, 2, 723341) It is true that the Government await the Settlement Officers report on some of the matters covered by this representation.
('15', 369, 1, 3, 723464) It is submitted that when the raiyats are groaning under the weight of oppression, such as I have described above, an inquiry by the Settlement Officer is a cumbersome method.
('15', 369, 1, 4, 723640) With him the grievances mentioned herein are but an item in an extensive settlement operation.
('15', 369, 1, 5, 723735) Nor does his inquiry cover all the points raised above.
('15', 369, 1, 6, 723791) Moreover, grievances have been set forth herein which are not likely to be disputed.
('15', 369, 1, 7, 723876) And they are so serious as to require immediate relief.
('15', 369, 1, 8, 723932) That tawan and sharahbeshi sattas and abwabs have been exacted cannot be questioned.
('15', 369, 1, 9, 724017) I hope it will not be argued that the raiyats can be fully protected as to these by recourse to law.
('15', 369, 1, 10, 724118) It is submitted that where there is wholesale exaction, courts are not a sufficient protection for the raiyats and the administrative protection of the Sarkar 1 as the supreme landlord is an absolute necessity.
('15', 369, 2, 11, 724329) The wrongs are twofold.
('15', 369, 2, 12, 724353) There are wrongs which are accomplished facts and wrongs which continue.
('15', 369, 2, 13, 724426) The continuing wrongs need to be stopped at once and a small inquiry may be made as to past wrongs, such as damages and abwabs already taken and sharahbeshi payments already made.
('15', 369, 2, 14, 724606) The raiyats should be told by proclamation and notices distributed broadcast among them that they are not only not bound to pay abwabs, tawan and sharahbeshi charges but that they ought not to pay them, that the Sarkar will protect them if any attempt is made to enforce payment thereof.
('15', 369, 2, 15, 724894) They should further be informed that they are not bound to render any personal service to their landlords and that they are free to sell their services wherever they choose and that they are not bound to grow indigo, sugar cane or any other crop unless they wish to do so and unless it is profitable for them.
('15', 369, 2, 16, 725204) The Bettiah Raj leases given to the factories should not be renewed until the wrongs are remedied and should, when renewed, properly safeguard the raiyats rights.
('15', 369, 3, 17, 725367) As to dasturi, it is clear that better paid and educated men should substitute the present holders of responsible offices and that no countenance should be given to the diminution in raiyats wages by illegal exaction of dasturi.
('15', 369, 3, 18, 725596) I feel sure that the planters are quite capable of dealing with the evil, although it is in their language as old as the Himalayas.

('15', 370, 1, 2, 725783) The raiyats being secured in their freedom, it would be no longer necessary to investigate the question of the inadequacy or otherwise of the consideration in the indigo sattas and cart hire sattas, and the wages.
('15', 370, 1, 3, 725997) The raiyats by common agreement should be advised to finish indigo or other crops for the current year.
('15', 370, 1, 4, 726101) But thenceforth, whether it is indigo or any other crop, it should be only under a system of absolute free will.
('15', 370, 2, 5, 726214) It will be observed that I have burdened this statement with as little argument as possible.
('15', 370, 2, 6, 726307) But if it is the desire of the Government that I should prove any of my conclusions, I shall be pleased to tender the proofs on which they are based.
('15', 370, 3, 7, 726457) In conclusion, I would like to state that I have no desire to hurt the planters feelings.
('15', 370, 3, 8, 726547) I have received every courtesy from them.
('15', 370, 3, 9, 726589) Believing as I do that the raiyats are labouring under a grievous wrong from which they ought to be freed immediately, I have dealt, as calmly as is possible for me to do so, with the system which the planters are working.
('15', 370, 3, 10, 726812) I have entered upon my mission in the hope that they as Englishmen born to enjoy the fullest personal liberty and freedom will not fail to rise to their status and will not begrudge the raiyats the same measure of liberty and freedom.
('15', 370, 4, 11, 727047) I am sending copies to the Commissioner of the Tirhut Division, the Collector of Champaran, the Subdivisional Officer of Bettiah, the Manager of the Bettiah Raj, the Secretaries, respectively, of the Bihar Planters Association and the District Planters Association.
('15', 370, 4, 12, 727313) I am circulating them also among those leaders of public opinion in the country who have kept themselves in touch with the work being done by my colleagues and myself.
('15', 370, 4, 13, 727481) The copies are being marked not for publication, as there is no desire to invite a public discussion of the question unless it becomes absolutely necessary.
('15', 370, 5, 14, 727638) I need hardly give the assurance that I am at the disposal of the Government whenever my presence may be required.

('15', 371, 2, 3, 727916) BETTIAH, May 14, 1917
('15', 371, 3, 4, 727938) CONFIDENTIAL Since the withdrawal of the order of the Magistrate served on Mr. Gandhi, the work of recording statements has continued without interruption.
('15', 371, 3, 5, 728094) Nearly 4000 statements have been taken.
('15', 371, 3, 6, 728134) Rayats have flocked to the two stations, Motihari and Bettiah.
('15', 371, 3, 7, 728197) The rush has been so great that the volunteers have not been able to cope with the work from day to day.
('15', 371, 3, 8, 728302) The volunteers are all local pleaders who have performed their work with great zeal and devotion.
('15', 371, 3, 9, 728400) Babu Brajakishore Prasad has superintended this part of the work.
('15', 371, 3, 10, 728466) The names of the other volunteers are: Babu Rajendra Prasad 2, Babu Dharanidhar 3, Babu Gorakh Prasad, Babu Ramnawami Prasad 4, Babu Sambhusaran 5 and Babu Anugrah Narain Sinha 6. Chance comers have also assisted occasionally.
('15', 371, 3, 11, 728693) Several villages have been visited and hundreds of rayats have been seen in their homes.
('15', 371, 3, 12, 728782) Planters have been always invited to attend the meetings with the rayats.
('15', 371, 3, 13, 728856) They have, however, not attended.
('15', 371, 3, 14, 728890) Their jamadars 7 have.
('15', 371, 3, 15, 728913) Planters have been individually seen by Mr. Gandhi and there was a conference between representative planters and him.
('15', 371, 3, 16, 729032) The planters were quite courteous but uncompromising.
('15', 371, 3, 17, 729086) They overstated their case,
('15', 371, 4, 18, 729114) 1 These appear to have been prepared by Gandhiji from time to time to brief his co workers and also (vide Note III) editors of the sympathetic papers to enable them to write with understanding of the real situation in Champaran.
('15', 371, 4, 19, 729343) Numbers III, V and VI in this series are signed by Gandhiji; No.
('15', 371, 4, 20, 729408) IV has not become available and it is not clear if this is No.

('15', 372, 1, 2, 730093) inasmuch as they claimed that they had always acted as benefactors of their rayats and that they had protected them from the rapacity of moneylenders.
('15', 372, 1, 3, 730244) Frequent interviews have taken place between the local officials and Mr. Gandhi.
('15', 372, 1, 4, 730325) The former have been more open than the planters and have certainly shown a desire for amicable settlement.
('15', 372, 1, 5, 730433) The officials have never concealed their opinion that they did not approve of the mission.
('15', 372, 1, 6, 730524) Some of them only reluctantly carried out the Government instructions to give Mr. Gandhi every facility.
('15', 372, 1, 7, 730629) The result has been that it has not been always an easy matter to obtain information from them.
('15', 372, 1, 8, 730725) They have expressed stronger disapproval of the presence of the helpers mentioned above.
('15', 372, 1, 9, 730814) The Sub divisional Officer at Bettiah often said 1 that he was afraid of a conflagration taking place any day by reason of the inquiry.
('15', 372, 1, 10, 730950) He said that the rayats had grown bolder and had formed a highly exaggerated notion of the results of the mission.
('15', 372, 1, 11, 731065) He even reported to the Government that unless the inquiry could be stopped, he could not be responsible for the peace of the district under his charge.
('15', 372, 1, 12, 731218) Some planters, too, went to Ranchi to complain to the Government that they were afraid of their own safety if the inquiry was continued.
('15', 372, 1, 13, 731355) It was on account of this that Mr. Gandhi was invited to meet Honble Mr. Maude at Bankipur on the 10th instant.
('15', 372, 2, 14, 731467) An outwork has been burnt down.
('15', 372, 2, 15, 731499) 2 The planters grew nervous and even suggested that it might be due to our inquiry.
('15', 372, 2, 16, 731583) There seems to be no connection between the fire and the inquiry.
('15', 372, 3, 17, 731649) Mr. Maude suggested 3 that the inquiry might now usefully be closed entirely and that Mr. Gandhi might submit his report to the Government.
('15', 372, 3, 18, 731789) and that if the inquiry could not be stopped, Mr. Gandhi should withdraw the pleader friends from the district.
('15', 372, 3, 19, 731901) Mr. Gandhi stated that the inquiry could not be entirely stopped but that he had advanced far enough to enable him to frame preliminary conclusions, that he could not as a point of honour think of dispensing with the help of the pleader friends whom he considered to be as sober and honourable as himself and who were of the greatest assistance to him in his work.
('15', 372, 3, 20, 732266) Mr. Maude was quite conciliatory in his conversation.

('15', 373, 1, 2, 732524) The enclosed representation 1 is the result of the interview.
('15', 373, 1, 3, 732586) The inquiry continues except to the extent that, instead of statements being recorded as heretofore by the volunteers, Mr. Gandhi will himself, as soon as he is free to be able to do so, sit for a few hours daily among the rayats and after hearing their statements 2 record his impressions.
('15', 373, 1, 4, 732877) The representation is deliberately an understatement.
('15', 373, 1, 5, 732931) The condition of the rayat is far worse than is pictured there.
('15', 373, 1, 6, 732995) It is not capable of being understood by a layman.
('15', 373, 1, 7, 733046) The planters rule has practically supplanted the rule of the local Government.
('15', 373, 1, 8, 733125) Nobody has the courage to speak up for the rayats.
('15', 373, 1, 9, 733176) The latter do not readily get the assistance of the local mukhtars 3. Many have privately come to Mr. Gandhi and told him much worse stories of oppression than have been recorded in the statements.
('15', 373, 1, 10, 733374) In Fiji and Natal, the evil was represented by a single law.
('15', 373, 1, 11, 733435) The evil was dealt with, if the law could be removed.
('15', 373, 1, 12, 733489) In Champaran, the evil is like a weed growing everywhere and anyhow and in growing has smothered all law and order.
('15', 373, 1, 13, 733605) The very laws for the protection of the rayats have been used by the planters to reduce them to serfdom.
('15', 373, 1, 14, 733710) As the planters have placed themselves above law, even decrees of courts have had no binding effect on them in many cases.
('15', 373, 1, 15, 733833) The evil, therefore, will require a tremendous effort before it is checked.
('15', 373, 1, 16, 733909) No stone is being left unturned to induce the planters to do justice without the necessity of a great and very serious public agitation.
('15', 373, 1, 17, 734046) The desire is, by inviting the Government to deal with the planters firmly, to avoid the publication of a report which is bound to stagger India.
('15', 373, 1, 18, 734192) Public men and women of India will never be able to sit still if the report has ever to be published until the wrongs it will narrate are remedied.
('15', 373, 1, 19, 734340) The mere narration is calculated to rouse passions and therefore every effort is being made to bring about a settlement without any public agitation.
('15', 373, 1, 20, 734490) If the settlement comes or even if it does not, it is necessary to post volunteers in villages to act as links between the planters and rayats, to steel the latters hearts and by their very presence to protect them from the tyranny of the amlas, etc.
('15', 373, 1, 21, 734741) The volunteers will be expected to remain in the villages for at least six months.
('15', 373, 1, 22, 734824) Their work will be smooth, if the Government approve of their

('15', 374, 1, 2, 735026) pre sence; it will be risky if they do not.
('15', 374, 1, 3, 735070) It is to be done in any event.
('15', 374, 1, 4, 735101) Whilst they are in the villages, they will teach the village boys and girls and will give the rayats lessons in elementary sanitation.
('15', 374, 1, 5, 735236) It may be stated that the rayat are the most backward and ignorant of almost any in India.
('15', 374, 1, 6, 735327) Education is admittedly in the lowest stage in this dis trict.
('15', 374, 1, 7, 735390) Sanitation is of the worst type.
('15', 374, 1, 8, 735423) Children are ill looking because they are ill fed.
('15', 374, 1, 9, 735474) The adult population suffers from some disease or other.
('15', 374, 1, 10, 735531) Many suffer from an ugly growth on the throat called goitre.
('15', 374, 1, 11, 735592) They have no physical or moral stamina.
('15', 374, 1, 12, 735632) Even the Rajputs are seized with a fear which it is humiliating to observe.
('15', 374, 1, 13, 735708) The present volunteers are pledged to the work above sketched.
('15', 374, 1, 14, 735771) It is not expected that Bihar will contribute many more volunteers of the type required.
('15', 374, 1, 15, 735860) The greatest care is being exercised in choosing them.
('15', 374, 1, 16, 735915) They have to be learned, responsible and sober men.
('15', 374, 1, 17, 735967) Those who will receive these notes are expected kindly to use their influence in securing volunteers and getting them to send their names.
('15', 374, 1, 18, 736106) At least a hundred such volunteers are required.
('15', 374, 1, 19, 736155) Those who need support for their families will have it given them, so far as it is on a moderate scale.

('15', 376, 8, 9, 738101) DEAR MILLIE, I have just received your letter.
('15', 376, 8, 10, 738148) Matheran is not habitable in the month of June.
('15', 376, 8, 11, 738196) And Bombay is likely to suit Ceilia best then.
('15', 376, 8, 12, 738243) If you are not living with the Petits, a flat in Colaba will give you a splendid breeze.
('15', 376, 8, 13, 738332) It is difficult for me to believe that Henry can be so bad as you have described him.
('15', 376, 8, 14, 738418) It is indeed a great relief that he is where he receives a brotherly attention and has best possible medical advice.
('15', 376, 8, 15, 738535) I shall anxiously await a daily bulletin from you.
('15', 376, 8, 16, 738586) If you do not give me a letter, give me only p.c.
('15', 376, 8, 17, 738636) please.
('15', 376, 8, 18, 738644) Is Waldo alright now?
('15', 376, 8, 19, 738666) How do you find the weather there?
('15', 376, 8, 20, 738701) Does the doctor say that both Henry and Waldo will be entirely free from the poison?
('15', 376, 8, 21, 738786) You know what the doctors generally say.
('15', 376, 8, 22, 738827) They say that once the poison has entered the system, it does not leave it for years.
('15', 376, 8, 23, 738913) Of course I do not believe it and Henrys body being so pure cannot be so shattered as to be liable to a recurrence of the attack.
('15', 376, 8, 24, 739043) However, the greatest care has to be used during convalescence if complete cure is to be attained.
('15', 376, 8, 25, 739142) Is Leon keeping well?

('15', 377, 5, 6, 739713) The correspondence speaks for itself.
('15', 377, 5, 7, 739751) It only remains for me to add that, so far as I am aware, there is not the slightest connection between the fire and myself.
('15', 377, 5, 8, 739876) Your message says that a whole factory has been burnt down, whereas the District Magistrates letter shows that a portion only of the outworks has been affected by the fire.

('15', 377, 10, 15, 740318) Olaha factory is an outwork of the Tarkalia concern.
('15', 377, 10, 16, 740371) The buildings burnt down were the engine room, press house and cake house.
('15', 377, 10, 17, 740446) The value of the buildings has been roughly estimated at twenty thousand rupees but this is only a very rough estimate.
('15', 377, 10, 18, 740566) No manager or Assistant Manager is in residence at the outwork.
('15', 377, 10, 19, 740630) There are, however, factory servants to look after the buildings.
('15', 377, 10, 20, 740696) The outwork is situated about twenty miles south west of Motihari.
('15', 377, 10, 21, 740763) The fact that the buildings were burnt down shortly after you came to the district and that your visit of enquiry has caused considerable excitement, etc., may possibly account for the rumours of all kinds which you say have come before you.
('15', 377, 10, 22, 741005) Yours sincerely, W.B. HEYCOCK

('15', 378, 2, 3, 741108) BETTIAH, May 17, 1917
('15', 378, 3, 4, 741130) DEAR SIR, Butai Sahu Halwai, Gulli Sahu Kanu, and Bhardul Thakore Badai of Raxaul Bazar have shown me receipts they hold for lands leased them by you.
('15', 378, 3, 5, 741281) They say that their houses are burnt down and that they are now being prevented from rebuilding and are being asked to vacate the lands in their possession.
('15', 378, 3, 6, 741438) Will you kindly let me know whether there is any truth in the above statements and if so why they are being prevented from rebuilding?
('15', 378, 4, 7, 741573) Yours faithfully,

('15', 378, 9, 12, 741738) CHHAGANLAL, There is no harm in sending the report of the Benares speech as revised by me.
('15', 378, 10, 13, 741829) You need not henceforth send Jamnadass letters here for he has resumed writing to me.
('15', 378, 10, 14, 741915) The one you sent this time, I am forwarding to Narandas.
('15', 378, 10, 15, 741972) He doesnt seem to have seen it.
('15', 378, 10, 16, 742004) You may inform me if there is anything particular in his letter.
('15', 378, 10, 17, 742069) You need not send a puggree for me here.
('15', 378, 10, 18, 742110) I am carrying on with what I have.
('15', 378, 10, 19, 742145) If you have not made the dhotis, get them ready.
('15', 378, 10, 20, 742194) I see that I shall need them.
('15', 378, 10, 21, 742224) I hope you have supplied more yarn to Umreth.
('15', 378, 10, 22, 742270) See that you dont drop that work.
('15', 378, 10, 23, 742304) I am of the opinion that, if Saiyad Mahomed and others agree to come on the same terms as Lalji, they should be admitted.
('15', 378, 10, 24, 742426) I see that we shall have to produce

('15', 379, 1, 3, 742612) We should also not take upon ourselves the responsibility for winding the bobbins.
('15', 379, 1, 4, 742695) Let them bring along their children.
('15', 379, 1, 5, 742732) If any poor people send their children to learn, these should be paid.
('15', 379, 1, 6, 742803) We may engage them in work only for some time; during the rest of the time we should teach them.
('15', 379, 1, 7, 742900) In short, I feel it is necessary that we should start a workshop.
('15', 379, 1, 8, 742966) By and by, we shall see our way.
('15', 379, 1, 9, 742999) In this connection, I also think sometimes that, if we can get some honest, paid men, it would be advisable to engage them.
('15', 379, 1, 10, 743123) They can be set to domestic chores and those [of us] who are at present occupied with this work can be released.
('15', 379, 1, 11, 743236) I think of this again and again.
('15', 379, 1, 12, 743269) But the idea will have to be carefully weighed.
('15', 379, 1, 13, 743317) It will perhaps be convenient, for our purpose, to engage an elderly widow, if we know of any.
('15', 379, 1, 14, 743412) I keep thinking along these lines during moments of leisure; however, since I think of these things so far away from you, you need not attach much weight to them.
('15', 379, 1, 15, 743575) If you carry them out, it will be on your own responsibility.
('15', 379, 1, 16, 743637) Seek all possible help from Vrajlal on this question.
('15', 379, 1, 17, 743691) He will be especially in a position to say something about it since the responsibility is his.

('15', 379, 6, 21, 743917) BETTIAH, Vaishakh Vad 11 [May 17, 1917] 1
('15', 379, 7, 22, 743959) BHAISHRI NARAHARI, I have your letter.
('15', 379, 7, 23, 743998) I went through it carefully.
('15', 379, 7, 24, 744027) I do believe that you have done nothing wrong in taking the step you have taken.
('15', 379, 7, 25, 744108) I am writing to Chhaganlal straightaway to pay you Rs. 75 a month.
('15', 379, 7, 26, 744175) It would be a great thing if you can live in such a way as to be able to carry on without needing more.
('15', 379, 7, 27, 744279) You will have to exercise enough self control even to do so.
('15', 379, 7, 28, 744340) I see that the time has not come yet when we have people who will manage without money or with the barest minimum of it.
('15', 379, 7, 29, 744461) For that a change in the entire atmosphere in every family is necessary.
('15', 379, 7, 30, 744534) This criticism is especially applicable to

('15', 380, 1, 2, 744658) Gujarat.
('15', 380, 2, 3, 744667) I doubt whether you will be able to bear the combined burden of your teaching work and translating Gokhales speeches.
('15', 380, 2, 4, 744785) My ideas about education are very exacting.
('15', 380, 2, 5, 744829) If we want to pour our souls into the pupils, we should constantly exercise our mind on how to teach them.
('15', 380, 2, 6, 744936) We should not get angry with them.
('15', 380, 2, 7, 744971) Passing on to them in the best possible language from day to day whatever we wish to give them, will take up much of our time.
('15', 380, 2, 8, 745098) Moreover, we must for the present think of teaching methods as well.
('15', 380, 2, 9, 745167) Everything will have to be taught in a new way.
('15', 380, 2, 10, 745215) All the same, you have no option now but to finish the translations.
('15', 380, 2, 11, 745284) I say this only to point out your future responsibilities and those of all other teachers.
('15', 380, 3, 12, 745375) I have not treated Geography as a separate subject.
('15', 380, 3, 13, 745427) That is why I have said that those who teach History should also teach Geography.
('15', 380, 3, 14, 745509) However, if you think that they should be treated as separate subjects for the time being, you may do so.
('15', 380, 3, 15, 745615) We will make what changes we find on experience to be necessary.
('15', 380, 4, 16, 745680) The teachers will have to come together at least once a week to exchange ideas and make such changes as may be called for.
('15', 380, 4, 17, 745803) The intelligent students should be consulted and their suggestions invited about methods of teaching.
('15', 380, 5, 18, 745905) The students health is the collective responsibility of the teachers; the main responsibility, however, will rest on the teacher in charge of hygiene.
('15', 380, 6, 19, 746056) The teachers should read up the subjects in the curriculum which they do not know.
('15', 380, 6, 20, 746139) Especially Hindi.
('15', 380, 6, 21, 746157) I can see from my work here how very essential Hindi is.
('15', 380, 6, 22, 746214) I find that I shall have to ask for volunteers from other places.
('15', 380, 6, 23, 746280) Difficulties will arise about those of them who do not know Hindi.
('15', 380, 6, 24, 746347) I see it proved every day that education is altogether incomplete without Hindi.
('15', 380, 7, 25, 746428) It would be good, I think, if Anandshankarbhai or Keshavlal bhai 1 could spare one hour daily or a few hours every week so that the teachers Gujarati may attain a really high standard and they may follow old Gujarati books without any difficulty.
('15', 380, 7, 26, 746675) We may consider in this hour what progress we can at present make in Gujarati, which books should be considered good and what equivalents for unfamiliar

('15', 381, 2, 5, 747139) These pillars of the Gujarati language will also be better enlightened in this way and have occasion to think about some matters to which they have given no thought.
('15', 381, 2, 6, 747305) The teachers technical vocabulary will become uniform and points about spelling, etc., will be settled.
('15', 381, 2, 7, 747409) At present, each of us has his own rules, or has no rules at all, to go by.

('15', 381, 8, 14, 747684) DEAR MILLIE, Your description of Henry still sounds unbelievable.
('15', 381, 8, 15, 747750) The mind simply refuses to think that he can be so pulled down.
('15', 381, 8, 16, 747814) I shall still retain my faith in the vitality of his system and believe that he will quickly regain his original strength.
('15', 381, 8, 17, 747937) My heart goes out to poor Waldo.
('15', 381, 8, 18, 747970) It must be terrible for him to be without a companion.
('15', 381, 8, 19, 748025) I like Dr. Saprus advice which does not apply to Henry at all.
('15', 381, 8, 20, 748088) He has never dreamt impossible dreams, he has always settled down like a respectable man as a conscientious man can feel settled in this unsettled world and he has always been a practical man of affairs and as such won esteem.
('15', 381, 8, 21, 748315) His life up to the present is unimpeachable evidence of all this.
('15', 381, 8, 22, 748381) I have found that most people here and elsewhere are highly unpractical, and falsely believing themselves to be matter of fact men, render themselves incapable of dreaming dreams impossible or otherwise and therefore remain totally dry as dust.
('15', 381, 8, 23, 748626) Good dreams are to the soul what fresh air is to the body.

('15', 382, 5, 9, 749181) BETTIAH, May 19, 1917
('15', 382, 6, 10, 749203) DEAR MR. HOLTTUM 2, I thank you for having come to Sariswa 3 and having sent your carriage.
('15', 382, 6, 11, 749295) After you and Mr. Lewis had withdrawn, I sat with the people who must have numbered over 500 and talked to them.
('15', 382, 6, 12, 749408) I told them that you wanted to do justice, that you were ready to take back the zirat 4 lands and that you considered that it was more profitable to you to get it back.
('15', 382, 6, 13, 749577) I told them too that in your opinion the people had taken the zirat lands from your predecessor not only willingly but most eagerly, that it was given to the raiyats not in lieu of indigo cultivation but it was given in order to relieve the raiyats from liability to supply labour to the landlord.
('15', 382, 6, 14, 749875) I further told them that you had shown me Mr. Barclays 5 letter to Mr. Gourlay 6 confirming the view and finally told them, whilst on this point, that if they returned the

('15', 382, 8, 17, 750259) 6 W. R. Gourlay, Director of Agriculture, Bengal and former S.D.O. of Bettiah, who conducted in 1908 a confidential enquiry into the affairs of indigo plantations in Champaran at the instance of the Bengal Government and submitted his recommendations the following year
('15', 383, 0, 1, 750529) 384 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 383, 1, 2, 750571) zirat lands, you expected them to grow indigo again as before up to the termination of the period of their contracts and I assured them that I would plead with you that it would be quite unfair to ask for raiyats to revert to indigo growing (for reasons to be presently stated).
('15', 383, 1, 3, 750850) I then invited those who wanted to abandon the zirat at once, although they had paid for the full agricultural year.
('15', 383, 1, 4, 750967) As a result, over 175 gave in their names there and then and men have been streaming in during the two days.
('15', 383, 1, 5, 751076) The total has reached nearly 500 up to the time of writing.
('15', 383, 1, 6, 751136) In going through the khatians 1, the receipts and the amounts charged against the zirat land, I find in 70 tenancies that on an average the raiyats are paying you Rs. 24.5.3 per bigha 2 of zirat land.
('15', 383, 1, 7, 751337) The largest amount charged is Rs. 91.7.3 per bigha and the smallest is Rs. 7.8.0 per bigha.
('15', 383, 1, 8, 751429) Incidentally, I observe that whilst 27 bighas of kasht 3 land pay Rs. 59.13.6, 27 bighas of zirat land pay you Rs. 659.7.0. It seems that in the vast majority of cases, the raiyats hold less than one bigha of zirat land.
('15', 383, 1, 9, 751650) The rate fixed varies with the extent of their kasht holding and not with the quality of the zirat.
('15', 383, 1, 10, 751750) And they are paying as much as Rs. 1 8 0 per bigha of kasht land in addition to from six annas to 12 annas per katha 4 of zirat.
('15', 383, 1, 11, 751879) And the kathas of zirat seem to vary with the bighas of kasht and in no case amounting to more than 3 kathas per bigha.
('15', 383, 1, 12, 751999) The average worked out for fifty villagers comes to 1_ kathas per bigha.
('15', 383, 1, 13, 752072) This, in my opinion, hardly bears out Mr. Barclays contention.
('15', 383, 1, 14, 752135) It rather bears out the raiyats contention that the settlement of zirat is another form of the tinkathia and was designed to cover the losses suffered by the concern when the price of indigo fell.
('15', 383, 1, 15, 752332) The raiyats insist that pressure was effectively put upon them to take zirat land.
('15', 383, 1, 16, 752415) Their contention seems to be borne out by the readiness with which they have come forward to surrender it.
('15', 383, 1, 17, 752522) For the last ten years, the raiyats have been paying what according to the above view amounts to tawan for not growing indigo.
('15', 383, 1, 18, 752649) And the concern has on that account an average of more than Rs. 100 per bigha of tinkathia.
('15', 383, 1, 19, 752741) In the circumstances and regard being had to the fact that you believe it to be advantageous for you to receive back the zirat land, I hope you will not press for reversion to indigo growing.
('15', 383, 2, 20, 752933) 1 Records of rights 2 A measure of land: 1,600 sq.
('15', 383, 2, 21, 752984) In Champaran, the bigha is much larger.

('15', 384, 0, 1, 753082) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 385
('15', 384, 1, 2, 753124) I notice that in some cases damages have been settled on kathas taken out of the kasht land of the raiyats.
('15', 384, 1, 3, 753232) I venture to think that, if you would see your way to accept my suggestion, take back the zirat and forgo the future damage whether tacked on to the zirat or to the kasht land, one of the sorest points of dispute between the concern and the raiyats would be amicably settled and you will have set an example which would be advantageously followed by the other planters.
('15', 384, 1, 4, 753602) In describing the process adopted by the concern for recovering losses on indigo from the raiyats, I have hitherto confined myself to your mukarrari land.
('15', 384, 1, 5, 753757) On tikka land, you seem to have accepted the system followed elsewhere.
('15', 384, 1, 6, 753829) You have taken handnotes for balance of tawan payable by the raiyats bearing heavy rate of interest.
('15', 384, 1, 7, 753930) I suggest that the outstanding handnotes may be cancelled.
('15', 384, 1, 8, 753989) The raiyats for the sake of peace and compromise should say nothing as to refund either on the hunda above referred to or the tawan already collected and of which the handnotes represent the balance.
('15', 384, 1, 9, 754189) As to the fines, I must confess that there is overwhelming evidence to show that they have been imposed on recalcitrant raiyats.
('15', 384, 1, 10, 754318) This complaint is almost universal.
('15', 384, 1, 11, 754354) I told the raiyats that you said that only nominal fines were imposed when the raiyats came to you for adjustment of their mutual quarrels and that you refunded these to the winners.
('15', 384, 1, 12, 754537) The raiyats resolutely protested and said that the fines even as much as Rs. 25 at a time and more were imposed for the so called offences against the concern.
('15', 384, 1, 13, 754697) The raiyats are equally firm in their complaint against your jamadar, Gokul Missir, and I would be pleased to place the evidence before you if you will care to go further into the matter.
('15', 384, 1, 14, 754885) With reference to the method (I understand only recently adopted) of the charging for permission to build new buildings or to rebuild, you justified the charge on the ground that the earth on the raiyats tenement belonged to the landlord and if the raiyats used it for building purposes, they must pay for it.
('15', 384, 1, 15, 755195) I find, on looking up the Bengal Tenancy Act, that the law allows the raiyats to build without any interference from the landlord so long as they build for the benefit of their holdings.
('15', 384, 1, 16, 755382) It seems to me that the charge is not warranted by law and I hope that you will waive it in future.
('15', 384, 1, 17, 755482) There remains then the question of cutting trees.
('15', 384, 1, 18, 755532) The section of the Bengal Tenancy Act dealing with the subject clearly allows the
('15', 385, 0, 1, 755614) 386 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 385, 1, 2, 755656) raiyat to cut without previous notice to or permission of the landlord.
('15', 385, 1, 3, 755728) But I understand that of late years the landlords have all over been receiving half of the timber cut.
('15', 385, 1, 4, 755831) I do not know whether the custom has been proved; this is a large question which can await settlement.
('15', 385, 1, 5, 755934) I await papers promised by you regarding Kodai Pan.
('15', 385, 1, 6, 755986) As to Sitaram Tewari 1, I think Rs. 36 on 11 kathas is a clerical error and I venture to suggest that it would be graceful on your part to recognize the error and take the rent at the usual assessment rate.
('15', 385, 1, 7, 756193) I would beg of you to carefully consider the points mentioned herein and, if you can grant relief to your raiyats in accordance with the suggestions made above, I do not doubt that it will lead to a lasting peace between your concern and its raiyats and, what is more, it will be a simple act of justice.

('15', 385, 10, 17, 756771) Just now we have more than we need.
('15', 385, 10, 18, 756807) If you cannot think of using it for any other purpose you can think of, send it to the Ashram to be kept for an emergency fund.
('15', 385, 10, 19, 756935) The Ashram too has no present need of money.
('15', 385, 10, 20, 756980) You will not perhaps be surprised to learn that all the pecuniary assistance in my work has come, in a way, in answer to prayer.
('15', 385, 10, 21, 757109) I have not been obliged to beg, i.e., for conducting the missions I have undertaken.

('15', 386, 5, 6, 757519) BETTIAH, May 20, 1917
('15', 386, 6, 7, 757541) DEAR MR. HEYCOCK, I have hitherto refrained from bringing to your notice statements, which have continued to stream in, to the effect that the raiyats are being prevented from coming in to me and that those who have come in have been subjected to all kinds of pinpricks by the kothi amlas and in some cases by the managers themselves.
('15', 386, 6, 8, 757876) I have discounted some of the statements.
('15', 386, 6, 9, 757918) I have taken down a few.
('15', 386, 6, 10, 757943) But if what I have heard about the doings of the Belwa and the Dhokraha concerns is true, it is calculated to end on one side at least, the friendly spirit in which the inquiry has hitherto been carried on.
('15', 386, 6, 11, 758150) I am most anxious to continue and to increase the friendly spirit.
('15', 386, 6, 12, 758217) I am straining every [nerve], so far as in me lies, to so conduct my mission that nothing but good will should be left behind, when its labours are finished.
('15', 386, 6, 13, 758375) I send you the statements 1 taken regarding the Belwa and the Dhokraha concerns.
('15', 386, 6, 14, 758456) If the statements are true, they do not reflect any credit upon the concerns in question.
('15', 386, 6, 15, 758546) I enclose, too, my letter 2 to Mr. Holttum which was written before I heard of the fire and which was despatched before I took the statements of the Dhokraha men last evening after 6.30 P.M. I can understand and even appreciate the feelings which are bound to fill those who are called upon to contemplate the prospect of having to forego huge incomes which they have hitherto been in the habit for a long time of receiving from their raiyats.
('15', 386, 6, 16, 758990) One cannot, therefore, mind any legitimate effort on their part to hold on to what they have considered as their rights.
('15', 386, 6, 17, 759111) But what is reported to have happened at the Belwa and Dhokraha dehats does not in my opinion fall under such a category.

('15', 387, 0, 1, 759345) 388 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 387, 1, 2, 759387) It is a known fact that the desire of the planters generally is, that my friends and I should not carry on our work.
('15', 387, 1, 3, 759504) I can only say that nothing but physical force from the Government or an absolute guarantee that the admitted or provable wrongs of the raiyats are to stop for ever, can possibly remove us from the District.
('15', 387, 1, 4, 759712) What I have seen of the conditions of the raiyats is sufficient to convince me that if we withdrew at this stage, we would stand condemned before man and God and, what is most important of all, we would never be able to forgive ourselves.
('15', 387, 1, 5, 759951) But the mission is totally of peace.
('15', 387, 1, 6, 759988) I cannot too often give the assurance that I bear no ill will against the planters.
('15', 387, 1, 7, 760072) I have been told that this is true of myself but that my friends are fired with an anti English feeling and that for them this is an anti English movement.
('15', 387, 1, 8, 760228) I can only say that I do not know a body of men who have less of that feeling than my friends.
('15', 387, 1, 9, 760323) I was not prepared for this pleasant revelation.
('15', 387, 1, 10, 760372) I was prepared for some degree of ill will.
('15', 387, 1, 11, 760416) I would have held it excusable.
('15', 387, 1, 12, 760448) I do not know that I have not been guilty of it myself under circumstances which have appeared to me most provoking.
('15', 387, 1, 13, 760565) But if I found that any of my associates were, in the conduct of this mission, actuated by any ill will at all, I should disassociate myself entirely from them and insist upon their leaving the mission.
('15', 387, 1, 14, 760768) At the same time, the determination to secure a freedom for the raiyats from the yoke that is wearing them down is inflexible.
('15', 387, 1, 15, 760895) Cannot the Government secure that freedom?
('15', 387, 1, 16, 760938) This is a natural exclamation.
('15', 387, 1, 17, 760969) My answer is that they cannot, in cases like this, without such assistance as is afforded to them by my mission.
('15', 387, 1, 18, 761082) The Government machinery is designedly slow.
('15', 387, 1, 19, 761127) It moves, must move, along the line of least resistance.
('15', 387, 1, 20, 761184) Reformers like myself, who have no other axe to grind but that of reform they are handling for the time being, specialize and create a force which the Government must reckon with.
('15', 387, 1, 21, 761364) Reformers may go wrong by being overzealous, indiscreet or indolent and ignorant.
('15', 387, 1, 22, 761446) The Government may go wrong by being impatient of them or over confident of their ability to do without them.
('15', 387, 1, 23, 761556) I hope, in this case, neither catastrophe will take place and the grievances, which I have already submitted and which are mostly admitted, will be effectively redressed.
('15', 387, 1, 24, 761727) Then the planters will have no cause to fear or suspect the mission of which I have the honour to be in charge and they will gladly accept the assistance of volunteers who will carry on the work of education and sanitation among the villagers and act as links between them and the raiyats.
('15', 388, 0, 1, 762017) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 389
('15', 388, 1, 2, 762059) Pray, excuse the length of this letter as also its argumentative character.
('15', 388, 1, 3, 762135) I could not avoid it, if I was to place my true position before you.
('15', 388, 1, 4, 762204) In bringing the two matters which have necessitated this communication, I have no desire to seek legal relief.
('15', 388, 1, 5, 762315) But I ask you to use such administrative influence as you can to preserve the friendly spirit which has hitherto prevailed between the kothis and my friends and myself.
('15', 388, 2, 6, 762484) I do not wish to suggest that the kothis in question are responsible for the fire.
('15', 388, 2, 7, 762567) That is the suspicion of some of the raiyats.
('15', 388, 2, 8, 762613) I have talked to hundreds of them about the two fires.
('15', 388, 2, 9, 762668) They say that the raiyats are not responsible for them, that they have no connection with the mission.
('15', 388, 2, 10, 762771) I readily accept this repudiation because we are incessantly telling the raiyats that this is not a mission of violence or reprisals and that any such thing on their part can only delay relief.
('15', 388, 2, 11, 762965) But if the kothis may not be held responsible for them, they may not seek to establish a connection between them and the mission.
('15', 388, 2, 12, 763095) Fires have taken place before now, and, mission or no mission, they will take place for ever.
('15', 388, 2, 13, 763189) Neither party may blame the other without the clearest possible proofs.
('15', 388, 3, 14, 763261) There is talk, too, about the lives of the planters being in danger.
('15', 388, 3, 15, 763330) Surely this cannot be serious talk.
('15', 388, 3, 16, 763366) Anyway, the mission cannot render them less safe than they are.
('15', 388, 3, 17, 763430) The character of the mission is wholly against any such activity.
('15', 388, 3, 18, 763496) It is designed to seek relief by self suffering, never by doing violence to the supposed or real wrongdoer.
('15', 388, 3, 19, 763604) And this lesson has been inculcated among the raiyats in season and out of season.Lastly, there is, I fear, ample proof of intimidation such as is described in the statements thereto attached.
('15', 388, 3, 20, 763797) Intimidation can only mean more trouble all round without meaning the slightest relief to the planters in the shape of retention of the present system.
('15', 388, 3, 21, 763949) I seek such help as you can vouchsafe in the circumstances I have ventured to place before you.
('15', 388, 3, 22, 764045) I am sending a copy to Mr. Lewis.

('15', 389, 3, 10, 764651) He has gone through all the articles.
('15', 389, 3, 11, 764689) Hope they are not mixed up.

('15', 390, 2, 3, 765954) (Dated Bettiah, the 20th May 1917)
('15', 390, 3, 4, 765989) BETTIAH, May 21 1, 1917
('15', 390, 4, 5, 766013) CONFIDENTIAL This is the 3rd note on the situation in Champaran.
('15', 390, 4, 6, 766078) The planters are, it is evident, trying to quash the mission or to discredit it.
('15', 390, 4, 7, 766159) The first remedy to secure their end was to tell the Government that their lives were in danger, owing to the presence of the mission in Champaran, and to suggest that there should be a commission appointed to investigate the relations between the planters and rayats.
('15', 390, 4, 8, 766428) Their lives are no more in danger now than they were before.
('15', 390, 4, 9, 766489) The rayats are too docile, and too much cowed down to attempt any such thing even if they wished it; moreover, the creed of the mission is absence of violence under every conceivable circumstance.
('15', 390, 5, 10, 766686) Mr. Gandhi himself, in his letter 2 to the Viceroy, written just after his arrival, suggested a commission, when he was about to be imprisoned.
('15', 390, 5, 11, 766830) But in the light of the discoveries since made, any commission can only delay relief.
('15', 390, 5, 12, 766916) And the leaders, after knowing the situation as it is partly disclosed in the representation to the Government already sent to them, cannot contemplate the possibility of the grievances continuing for an indefinite time.
('15', 390, 5, 13, 767137) Most of the serious grievances are admitted.
('15', 390, 5, 14, 767182) They have not disappeared because the Government have been supine.
('15', 390, 5, 15, 767249) They have been afraid to apply the remedies with firmness.
('15', 390, 5, 16, 767308) They have placed too much reliance upon the good faith of the planters.
('15', 390, 5, 17, 767380) And the planters have disregarded both the laws and the Government instructions.
('15', 390, 5, 18, 767461) No commission can deal with such a situation.
('15', 390, 5, 19, 767507) The Government alone can do it, if they wish or are forced.
('15', 390, 5, 20, 767567) It is clear that the planters want a commission, which would supplant and extinguish the activities of the mission.
('15', 390, 5, 21, 767683) The workers in the cause cannot, without doing the greatest violence to their conscience, retire in favour of a commission.
('15', 390, 5, 22, 767807) The appointment of the
('15', 390, 6, 23, 767830) 1 Gandhiji appears to have begun this note on the 20th and to have concluded it on the 21st.

('15', 391, 0, 1, 767980) 392 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 391, 1, 2, 768022) commission can, therefore, be accepted only if the continuing wrongs are remedied now, and if the members appointed on the commission are such as to inspire confidence, and this on the understanding that the mission is to continue its work.
('15', 391, 1, 3, 768263) The scope of it will be changed if a commission is appointed, i.e., the mission instead of conducting the enquiry will be collecting evidence to be placed before the commission, and taking the villagers statements.
('15', 391, 1, 4, 768478) The wrongs that must be redressed before a commission is accepted are (i) the abolition, not in name but in reality, of abwabs or illegal cesses exacted by the planters, (ii) the abolition of the damages in lieu of the indigo cultivations whether in a lump sum or by way of sharahbeshi, (iii) the abolition of tinkanthia in every shape or form, (iv) the abolition of the custom of imposing fines on raiyats, (v) the abolition of force in exacting labour or other obedience to the planters will.
('15', 391, 2, 5, 768973) What, therefore, the commission will enquire into will be: (l) the condition of the tenure of planters; (2) the propriety and possibility of securing for the rayats a refund of the illegal cesses already taken by the planters; (3) the condition under which labour has been received by the landlords; (4) the sufficiency or otherwise of the wages received by the labourers; (5) the causes of the deep poverty of the masses and their utter helplessness.
('15', 391, 3, 6, 769425) The above points have merely to be mentioned to know that the planters contemplate a commission totally different from the one we should accept.
('15', 391, 4, 7, 769570) The safest plan, therefore, for the Press and the public, in so far as it may be necessary to give an opinion, is to insist on the redress of the admitted wrongs first, and then accept appointment of a commission, if found necessary, it being always understood that the workers continue their work, in any event.
('15', 391, 5, 8, 769883) The second method adopted by the planters is to seize or create incidents in order to make the Government nervous about the mission and to intimidate the mission and its helpers.
('15', 391, 6, 9, 770062) One fire 1 has already been so used.
('15', 391, 6, 10, 770099) The popular belief is that the damage done is slight and that it is the work of the planters themselves.
('15', 391, 6, 11, 770204) But that idea may be dismissed.
('15', 391, 6, 12, 770236) The fire may be accepted as an accident or the act of an incendiary, not in any way connected

('15', 392, 1, 2, 770395) with the mission.
('15', 392, 1, 3, 770413) Mr. Heycocks letter 1, in answer to Mr. Gandhis question 2, shows that (1) the damage done is at the mostRs. 20,000; he himself emphasises the fact that it is a rough estimate, i.e., given by the planters; (2) he has no evidence that there is the slightest connection between the enquiry and the fire.
('15', 392, 2, 4, 770715) To this may be added the fact that no member of the mission has gone to these parts, and that the outwork was not in use, when the fire broke out.
('15', 392, 2, 5, 770862) Another fire 3 broke out on the 19th instant.
('15', 392, 2, 6, 770908) A katcheri 4
('15', 392, 3, 7, 770921) has been burnt down.
('15', 392, 3, 8, 770942) It is not known whether it has been utilised by the planters for the end suggested above.
('15', 392, 3, 9, 771032) That fire did take place in a place just newly visited by the mission.
('15', 392, 3, 10, 771103) Mr. Gandhi went there on Wednesday and the fire broke out, on Friday last.
('15', 392, 3, 11, 771178) Immediately on the outbreak of the fire, information was brought to Mr. Gandhi that it was probably the work of the kothi people.
('15', 392, 3, 12, 771308) A statement 5 has been recorded to the effect that a factory man was seen the very evening removing a bundle of papersthe inference being that the papers were removed prior to setting the katcheri on fire.
('15', 392, 3, 13, 771514) Support is lent to the story from the fact that the manager and the Sub Divisional Officer were present at the enquiry for a short time on Wednesday, that the rayats mentionedfirmly that they were forcibly made to take zirat land, which was made to bear the losses which the concern suffered owing to the fall in the price of indigo, that the manager in bravado said that he would gladly take the zirat back, that Mr. Gandhi promptly invited the names of those who wanted to surrender the zirat land.
('15', 392, 3, 14, 772015) This mishap (to the concern) must have (so the theory runs) enraged the manager, and in order to discredit the enquiry, he must have instigated the fire.
('15', 392, 3, 15, 772169) On Thursday, the day previous to the fire, the manager went to a neighbouring village, and spoke roughly to the people, inasmuch as they had surrendered their zirat, and threatened them by saying he would insist on their re growing indigo.
('15', 392, 3, 16, 772409) The rayats remained unmoved.
('15', 392, 3, 17, 772438) This would be an additional reason for starting the fire.
('15', 392, 3, 18, 772496) This, however, is purely an impression which may have no foundation in facts.
('15', 392, 3, 19, 772574) One thing is certain that the mission has

('15', 393, 1, 2, 772885) absolutely nothing to do with the fires.
('15', 393, 1, 3, 772926) The value of the katcheri is unknown.
('15', 393, 1, 4, 772964) It is not likely to be more than Rs. 200. 1
('15', 393, 2, 5, 773008) The third method adopted is continuous pinpricks administered to the villagers.
('15', 393, 2, 6, 773088) The latest instance of organised intimidation is where factory amlas went to a village, and molested the labourers of a small zamindar, who is a co sharer in a small zamindari with the factory, and who declines to surrender his share to it, and who is alleged to have circulated among the rayats the news of the mission.
('15', 393, 2, 7, 773409) Statements have been received abundantly proving the alleged intimidation.
('15', 393, 2, 8, 773484) Reports are continuously being received from individual rayats to the effect that they are threatened with all kinds of penalties for going to Mr. Gandhi and they come at considerable risk to themselves.
('15', 393, 3, 9, 773688) Needless to say that nothing will deter the workers from continuing their work.
('15', 393, 3, 10, 773768) To abandon it would mean a terrible wrong done to the rayats.
('15', 393, 3, 11, 773830) The presence of a body of workers, always listening to the simple but pathetic tale of their woes, and the knowledge that they are striving to help them and that the latter would go to them in the hour of need have buoyed them up and have given them hope and courage.
('15', 393, 3, 12, 774098) The workers will be unworthy of their cause and country, if through fear or anything else, they for a moment thought of withdrawing until the rayats are able to breathe free.
('15', 393, 4, 13, 774273) Mr. Gandhi has addressed to the District Magistrate of Champaran a letter 2 on the incidents above set forth.
('15', 393, 4, 14, 774383) Copies of this letter and other documents will be sent herewith or will shortly follow.
('15', 393, 4, 15, 774471) The precautions thus taken may restrain the planters in their plan of intimidation.
('15', 393, 4, 16, 774555) But the situation may develop at any moment and lawlessness may break out in intense form.
('15', 393, 4, 17, 774646) It will now be understood that if this happens, the fault will in no way be that of the members of the mission, and that the public will understand that the mission will continue its work.
('15', 393, 4, 18, 774835) The foregoing emphasises the need for getting volunteers ready, so that they may start at a moments notice.
('15', 393, 4, 19, 774943) The volunteers must be grown up, responsible, sober and educated men.
('15', 393, 4, 20, 775013) They should be inured to hardships or ready to bear hardships; they should come prepared to see the struggle through, they must have workable knowledge of Hindi (Tamils alone are, therefore, ineligible, unless

('15', 394, 7, 9, 775699) MY DEAR MILLIE, I see that as your labours are about to finish (thank God) the heat is beginning to tell on you.
('15', 394, 7, 10, 775812) It is ever thus.
('15', 394, 7, 11, 775829) Somehow or other Providence is the kindest when it puts us through the sorest trials.
('15', 394, 7, 12, 775915) Please tell Henry he ought to have sent me the speeches to which he has written his eloquent preface.
('15', 394, 7, 13, 776017) But if the preface is eloquent it is not written from the depth of his heart.
('15', 394, 7, 14, 776095) If he had, he would have shown the sham underlying it all without wounding anybody.
('15', 394, 7, 15, 776179) The preface leaves on one the impression that there was no other side to the picture.
('15', 394, 7, 16, 776265) And yet it obtrudes itself on one wherever we go.
('15', 394, 7, 17, 776315) So, I shall charitably assume that Henry thought he might for once at least leave it alone.

('15', 396, 7, 8, 777839) BETTIAH, The 21st May, 1917
('15', 396, 8, 9, 777867) This morning at about 10 a.m.
('15', 396, 8, 10, 777897) some men came from Dhokraha and informed Mr. Gandhi that some officers had been there.
('15', 396, 8, 11, 777984) He was questioning them on the occurrence, when one of them said that he had heard that the doors of the kachahri had
('15', 396, 9, 12, 778102) been removed by the factory men before the fire.
('15', 396, 9, 13, 778151) I suggested that a local inspection might give us useful information.
('15', 396, 9, 14, 778221) Mr. Gandhi accepted the suggestion and asked me to go to Dhokraha personally.
('15', 396, 9, 15, 778299) Accordingly, I proceeded to the scene at once.I reached Dhokraha at about 11.30 a.m.
('15', 396, 9, 16, 778384) In the kothi I found only a cartman.
('15', 396, 9, 17, 778421) He denied having been present during the time the fire was raging and informed me that the chaukidar 1
('15', 396, 10, 18, 778524) I asked him to fetch the chaukidar.
('15', 396, 10, 19, 778560) Meanwhile I proceeded to inspect the kachahri.
('15', 396, 11, 20, 778607) This kachahri is situated inside the compound of the residential bungalow of the manager of the concern.
('15', 396, 11, 21, 778712) It consists of a single room about 21 feet by 15 feet roughly.
('15', 396, 12, 22, 778775) The entire roof work has come down.
('15', 396, 12, 23, 778811) The walls are made of bricks, plastered with mud.
('15', 396, 12, 24, 778861) The whitewash on the walls, both inside and outside, is unaffected.
('15', 396, 12, 25, 778929) Black was noticeable at the top at four or five places only.
('15', 396, 12, 26, 778990) The appearance of the upper portion of the wall gives one the impression that the rafter of the roof must have been pulled away to prevent the spreading of the fire.
('15', 396, 12, 27, 779156) The roof was thatched with straw over which was placed a covering of country tiles.
('15', 396, 12, 28, 779240) .At places in the heap of rubbish were noticeable charred rafters, both outside and inside the room.
('15', 396, 12, 29, 779341) There was found a heap of partly burnt papers.
('15', 396, 12, 30, 779388) I examined them.
('15', 396, 12, 31, 779405) They were all siahas 2 and sattas.
('15', 396, 12, 32, 779440) The siahas were for the

('15', 397, 1, 3, 779617) .The doors as well as the frames of the three windows were altogether untouched by fire.
('15', 397, 1, 4, 779706) The door C was not found in the buildings, nor was its framework there.
('15', 397, 1, 5, 779778) This door is about 7_ feet by 5 feet.
('15', 397, 1, 6, 779816) There were clear indications of the framework of the door being removed.
('15', 397, 1, 7, 779889) The plaster had given way.
('15', 397, 1, 8, 779916) The mud underneath the framework was quite clean.
('15', 397, 1, 9, 779966) At the door D, the framework was charred all along, but not damaged much.
('15', 397, 1, 10, 780040) There were a few hinges sticking to it.
('15', 397, 1, 11, 780080) I examined them and the fresh removal of the rust from them clearly suggested that the screws had been taken out of them.
('15', 397, 1, 12, 780202) One or two screws were found still in the holes.
('15', 397, 1, 13, 780251) The door appertaining to this framework was not there.
('15', 397, 1, 14, 780306) There were no indications in the debris of the frame or the door in their burnt condition.
('15', 397, 1, 15, 780397) No panes were found at C. There were about half a dozen small pieces of glass.
('15', 397, 2, 16, 780476) This room is said to have been formerly used as an office where rent was collected.
('15', 397, 2, 17, 780560) About 2 or 3 years back, it was stated, this office was closed and all the papers of the concern were removed to Loheria.
('15', 397, 2, 18, 780682) Only a chaukidar remains in this
('15', 397, 3, 19, 780715) compound.
('15', 397, 3, 20, 780725) A house about a hundred yards away from the residential bungalow is occupied by the kothi men.
('15', 397, 4, 21, 780820) The examination of the debris showed that the contents of the room when the fire broke out could only have been meagre.
('15', 397, 4, 22, 780940) I estimate the damage to be under Rs. 200.

('15', 397, 11, 29, 781160) CHHAGANLAL, This letter is only for you two brothers 2. We must not turn away from the temper of the times.
('15', 397, 11, 30, 781268) Whatever your parents may say, deep down they do wish that their devoted son and their daughter in law should be with them.
('15', 397, 11, 31, 781392) One of you two brothers should certainly stay with them.

('15', 398, 1, 2, 781687) go to Rajkot.
('15', 398, 1, 3, 781701) If the times were not awry why would families break up?
('15', 398, 1, 4, 781757) Hence, I am convinced that if Khushalbhai does not come to Ahmedabad, one of you brothers must stay at Rajkot.
('15', 398, 1, 5, 781868) We assume that there is nothing wrong in our women going to their in laws or their parents for delivery.
('15', 398, 1, 6, 781973) This too I think is not right.
('15', 398, 1, 7, 782004) Why should Narandas send Jamna to Rajkot?
('15', 398, 1, 8, 782046) Why cant you see that if the delivery cannot take place in Bombay, it is not a fit place to live in?
('15', 398, 1, 9, 782147) Who will see Jamna through her delivery?
('15', 398, 1, 10, 782188) Had Dev Bhabhi 1 not been an invalid it would have been simple.
('15', 398, 1, 11, 782252) Now she cannot be expected to attend to such jobs.
('15', 398, 1, 12, 782303) It is our duty to make our parents feel in their old age that it is not only we who are their children but that they are the progenitors of the world at large.
('15', 398, 1, 13, 782463) This can happen only when we do not make them slave for us.
('15', 398, 1, 14, 782523) It is the duty of a husband to be with his wife during child birth.
('15', 398, 1, 15, 782591) (This last is a separate idea but I am mentioning it here.) Why is Santok at Morvi?
('15', 398, 1, 16, 782675) I am troubled by the information.
('15', 398, 1, 17, 782709) Her duty solely was to serve the sick at Rajkot.
('15', 398, 1, 18, 782758) She should not have left the house at Rajkot even for a single moment.
('15', 398, 1, 19, 782829) That is my view.
('15', 398, 1, 20, 782846) I realize that if Santok does not feel so she cannot be forced to do it.
('15', 398, 1, 21, 782919) I am writing this for consideration of the matter to the extent that Maganlal has sympathy with it.
('15', 398, 1, 22, 783019) Maganlal too is one of us.
('15', 398, 1, 23, 783046) All that he can say is: this is worth doing and this is not. He cannot go beyond that.
('15', 398, 1, 24, 783133) It occurs to me that I should put before you two the question whether our education has in some way harmed the purity of filial devotion.
('15', 398, 1, 25, 783271) If you think it proper let Narandas read this letter.
('15', 398, 1, 26, 783325) My mind is otherwise occupied and right now I have some other work to attend to.
('15', 398, 1, 27, 783406) Hence, I have not found the peace of mind that is requisite for writing this letter.
('15', 398, 1, 28, 783491) Usually I have peace at this time.
('15', 398, 1, 29, 783526) It is just six oclock in the morning.
('15', 398, 1, 30, 783564) I am hesitating for fear that Narandas may not realize the import of my writing.
('15', 398, 1, 31, 783645) You two know me quite well and so I do not hesitate to put my jumbled ideas before you.
('15', 398, 1, 32, 783733) Jamnadas may read this letter.

('15', 399, 3, 11, 784341) As for the expenses on the looms which you ask for, write to Chi.
('15', 399, 3, 12, 784407) Maganlal.
('15', 399, 3, 13, 784417) He will send what he thinks fit.
('15', 399, 3, 14, 784450) You dont say what progress you have made.
('15', 399, 3, 15, 784492) I dont know whether you devote all your time to your work.
('15', 399, 3, 16, 784551) You are growing more proficient in weaving day by day; you should both devote yourselves entirely to that work.
('15', 399, 3, 17, 784663) Then alone will you succeed.
('15', 399, 3, 18, 784692) You may, if so inclined, send Chi.
('15', 399, 3, 19, 784727) Chhotam to Ahmedabad.
('15', 399, 3, 20, 784749) Send him only if he is agreeable.
('15', 399, 3, 21, 784783) It is necessary to win him over.
('15', 399, 3, 22, 784816) Dont force him to go.
('15', 399, 3, 23, 784838) It is because he was very eager to go with you that I allowed him.
('15', 399, 3, 24, 784905) He will get along in Ahmedabad only if he is himself willing.
('15', 399, 3, 25, 784967) I shall never approve of your going to South Africa.
('15', 399, 3, 26, 785020) I see nothing but harm in your submitting to Ratanshis 2 desire in this matter.
('15', 399, 3, 27, 785100) He keeps on writing but so far he has not sent a single pie.
('15', 399, 3, 28, 785161) If you go there, I think your life will be wasted as his has been.
('15', 399, 3, 29, 785228) If you wish, you may send this letter to Ratanshi.
('15', 399, 3, 30, 785279) I think weaving has a bright future, if only you two devote yourselves to it.

('15', 401, 3, 5, 787073) They further state that this was done as a punishment for their having come previously and made statements before my colleagues at Motihari.

('15', 401, 11, 15, 787695) SIR, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 19th and the 21st instant.
('15', 401, 11, 16, 787795) I am grateful for the letters and the assurances contained therein.

('15', 402, 1, 2, 788005) I am suggesting that [as] the matters complained of by me required immediate treatment, it was not contemplated that the Government could pass orders without receiving reports from the local officers and without hearing the landlords.
('15', 402, 1, 3, 788240) Had I intended otherwise, the sending of copies of my note 1 to the local officers and the Planters Associations would have been purposeless.
('15', 402, 1, 4, 788382) If I may be permitted to say so, the instructions to the local officers and the invitation to the Planters Associations to send in their reports or observations, as the case may be, before the 30th June next largely meets the situation in point of time.
('15', 402, 1, 5, 788636) With reference to the legal aspect and the decisions of courts, they have not escaped attention.
('15', 402, 1, 6, 788733) But I venture to submit that legal decisions or legal technicalities cannot for a moment be allowed to perpetuate wrongs suffered by vast masses of people.
('15', 402, 1, 7, 788889) With much respect, but every confidence, I submit that the situation presented by me raises grave moral issues which in order that justice may be done might necessitate disregard of legal technicalities and legal decisions where they are in conflict with real justice.
('15', 402, 1, 8, 789158) The vast inequality between landlords and rayats renders it well nigh impossible for courts of law or even Settlement Officers to arrive at the truth in cases brought before them.
('15', 402, 1, 9, 789338) I see illustrations of the proposition just submitted multiplying before me every day.
('15', 402, 1, 10, 789425) Instances are not wanting of wrongs having been rectified in spite of their having been countenanced by courts of justice.
('15', 402, 1, 11, 789548) Regarding abwabs, I may be permitted to point out that the inclusion of a penalty clause in the forthcoming Bettiah Raj leases will grant only partial and tardy relief.
('15', 402, 1, 12, 789717) For the leases will not cover the whole of the tenancies affected, and with respect to a wrong which has been unanimously admitted, the postponement of relief till the termination of and the renewal of the leases means unnecessary delay.
('15', 402, 1, 13, 789955) I take it that the leases will not be renewed until the agrarian condition is placed on a sound basis.
('15', 402, 1, 14, 790058) It may be added that a penalty clause in his lease is no remedy against a landlord who places himself above law.
('15', 402, 1, 15, 790171) In my humble opinion, therefore, the issue of a notice warning landlords against exacting abwabs, salami 2, fines, etc., or impressing labour, carts, or ploughs and informing raiyats that they ought not to pay them and that they are not bound to give their landlords their labour

('15', 403, 9, 10, 790945) DEAR MR. HEYCOCK, I have just now before me men from Ramsingh Chhatauni who tell me that they were beaten by Mr. Irwin on Sunday night.
('15', 403, 9, 11, 791081) They say there are men too who saw an assault committed on a third man and themselves by the factory men.
('15', 403, 10, 12, 791187) Another man tells me that over fifty bighas of their own land was taken away from them by the kothi in exchange for some other land for which they did not then care and do not now care.If these statements are true, they are serious.
('15', 403, 10, 13, 791420) As there appears to be some tension, I want as far as is possible to avoid for a little time having to go to the dehats.
('15', 403, 10, 14, 791541) But I feel however that I should visit Chhatauni this evening.
('15', 403, 10, 15, 791604) And I shall leave here at 5.30 p.m.

('15', 404, 9, 16, 792794) I hope you, dont mind my having taken the liberty.
('15', 404, 9, 17, 792845) Those who do not grow indigo, also want to make illegal gains.
('15', 404, 9, 18, 792908) Hence they force the raiyats on their land to labour for them at a trifling wage or none at all at times and make them pay extras apart from rents.
('15', 404, 9, 19, 793056) Yes, the condition is no better than that of slaves.
('15', 404, 9, 20, 793109) The further papers I have sent you will throw more light on the question.
('15', 404, 9, 21, 793183) I must say that the planters are not alone to blame.
('15', 404, 9, 22, 793236) The planters happen to be English.
('15', 404, 9, 23, 793271) Indian landlords are not better and some of them are much worse.
('15', 404, 9, 24, 793336) It is undoubtedly the ignorance on this point of public men that has permitted the wrong to continue so long.
('15', 404, 9, 25, 793446) Governments rarely move except under pressure.

('15', 405, 7, 11, 794132) The cobra when asked by Nala, told him that he was bitten so as to transform his appearance and so enable him successfully to hide his identity during his banishment.

('15', 405, 7, 13, 794377) After a long silence I received a letter from Natesan 3 today in which he says that he has been away in Ooty, etc.
('15', 405, 7, 14, 794492) This may account for his silence.
('15', 405, 7, 15, 794526) But he is, I know, very careless about answering letters.

('15', 406, 1, 2, 795253) 332. SPREADING HINDI 1
('15', 406, 2, 3, 795276) Hindi alone can become the common language of the educated people of India.
('15', 406, 2, 4, 795352) All that has to be considered is how this can be brought about.
('15', 406, 2, 5, 795416) The place that English is trying to usurp today, and which it is impossible for it to take, must be given to Hindi; for it alone has the right to it.
('15', 406, 2, 6, 795566) This place cannot go to English, for it is a foreign language and very difficult for us to learn.
('15', 406, 2, 7, 795664) Learning Hindi is childs play in comparison.
('15', 406, 2, 8, 795709) The number of those speaking Hindi is almost 65 million.
('15', 406, 2, 9, 795766) The Bengali, Bihari, Oriya, Marathi, Gujarati, Rajasthani, Punjabi and Sindhi languages are sisters of Hindi.
('15', 406, 2, 10, 795876) People speaking these languages can understand and speak a little of Hindi.
('15', 406, 2, 11, 795952) If we include these, the number is almost 220 million.
('15', 406, 2, 12, 796007) How then can English, which even a hundred thousand Indians cannot speak correctly, compete successfully with a language which is so widely used?
('15', 406, 2, 13, 796153) That to this day we have not even begun conducting our national business in Hindi is because of our cowardice, lack of faith and ignorance of the greatness of the Hindi language.
('15', 406, 2, 14, 796332) If we give up our cowardice, cultivate faith and realize the greatness of the Hindi language, Hindi will begin to be used for the work of our national and Provincial councils and Government or ganizations.
('15', 406, 2, 15, 796538) The beginning should be made in the Provinces.
('15', 406, 2, 16, 796585) If there is some difficulty in this, it is for people speaking the Dravidian languages like Tamil, etc., but we have the remedy for this too.
('15', 406, 2, 17, 796727) Hindi knowing men who are zealous, brave, full of self respect and energetic should be sent to Madras and other provinces to teach Hindi without receiving payment.
('15', 406, 2, 18, 796891) With the help of such heroic missionaries, the educated people of Madras, etc.
('15', 406, 2, 19, 796970) can learn Hindi in a very short time.
('15', 406, 2, 20, 797008) If we have the right spirit, the solution is as simple as the rule of three.
('15', 406, 2, 21, 797085) The more instructors are sent, the faster will be the spread of Hindi.
('15', 406, 2, 22, 797156) Besides the sending of teachers, self instruction books should also be prepared.
('15', 406, 2, 23, 797237) These books should be distributed free.
('15', 406, 2, 24, 797277) Famous speakers should also be sent to bring home to the people the importance of learning Hindi.
('15', 406, 2, 25, 797375) What it is necessary to do in Tamil Nad for the spread of Hindi, it is desirable to do in Bombay and other provinces.
('15', 406, 2, 26, 797493) Hindi books should be prepared for people speaking Marathi, Gujarati, etc., and

('15', 407, 1, 2, 797695) workers should be sent to those areas.
('15', 407, 1, 3, 797734) This work requires money.
('15', 407, 1, 4, 797760) The well to do among us should not take it as a burden.
('15', 407, 1, 5, 797816) It is their duty to assist in this gigantic enterprise.
('15', 407, 1, 6, 797872) It is necessary to set up a small committee to organize this.
('15', 407, 1, 7, 797934) It will be proper to see that only active workers are put on it.
('15', 407, 1, 8, 797999) One important matter is implied in this submission and that is that no distinction is made between Hindi and Urdu.
('15', 407, 1, 9, 798114) Indeed, why should we quarrel with our Muslim brethren?
('15', 407, 1, 10, 798170) They may use the Persian script.
('15', 407, 1, 11, 798203) A few among us know the Persian script and more will learn it.
('15', 407, 1, 12, 798266) So long as our Muslim brethren have not learnt the Devnagari, both the scripts will continue to be used for national work.
('15', 407, 1, 13, 798389) However, this is a matter we can decide in a fraternal spirit with our Muslim brethren.
('15', 407, 1, 14, 798477) Right now the chief task is to spread the national language throughout India in the Devnagari script.

('15', 407, 5, 18, 798677) CHHAGANLAL, I am sending you a letter from Prabhudas.
('15', 407, 5, 19, 798731) He is not with me at present.
('15', 407, 5, 20, 798761) I am going to tell him that he has written the letter half heartedly.
('15', 407, 5, 21, 798831) He should write on a good paper without smudging it and in detail.
('15', 407, 5, 22, 798898) I will tell him that.
('15', 407, 5, 23, 798920) You too may write to him something to that effect.
('15', 407, 5, 24, 798971) I do not want to hurt him, still I want him to make progress.
('15', 407, 5, 25, 799033) He is very happy here goes for walks.
('15', 407, 5, 26, 799071) He complains of headaches in the afternoon.
('15', 407, 5, 27, 799115) It seems there is some problem with his eyes.
('15', 407, 5, 28, 799161) He may require glasses after his eyes are examined.
('15', 407, 5, 29, 799213) His health is improving here.
('15', 407, 5, 30, 799243) He is able to eat well.
('15', 407, 5, 31, 799267) He takes ghee, curd, fruit, etc., in plenty.
('15', 407, 5, 32, 799312) I am sending Mahatmajis letter 2 for all of you to read.
('15', 407, 6, 33, 799369) 1 The letter appears to have been written before the one to the addressee dated May 30, 1917; Vide Guide to London, 1893 94. The Tuesday preceding May 30 was May 29, which may well be the date when this letter was written.

('15', 409, 9, 12, 801387) DEAR SIR, Owing to certain statements made by your raiyats of Tola Gujpura Ramsingh, Chhatauni, I paid on Friday last a surprise visit to the Tola at about 8 p.m.
('15', 409, 9, 13, 801550) I met over fifty villagers and they pointed out to me a piece of land said to be 51 bighas in extent which (they said) had been recently converted by you into zirat.
('15', 409, 9, 14, 801716) They said that in most cases they were given an equivalent in extent but not in quality.
('15', 409, 9, 15, 801805) They pointed out the village pasturage bordering on the converted zirat which (they said) had now become practically inaccessible owing to the fear of their cattle being impounded.
('15', 409, 9, 16, 801986) They showed me also the only way (according to their statement) leading to the cattle pound, and said that they could not for the same fear use it as it passed by the zirat.
('15', 409, 9, 17, 802160) The men bitterly complained that the dispossession which they hold was forcible had caused them a great loss.
('15', 409, 9, 18, 802270) They stated that at the time of conversion they were made to put their thumb impressions to certain documents the contents of which they did not know and the

('15', 410, 1, 2, 802492) copies of which they were not given.
('15', 410, 2, 3, 802529) Hiraman Lohar, who was one of the party, told me that he was assaulted on Sunday, the 20th instant, by your employees for having remonstrated with them on their trying to take his bhusa 1, and that he was only released on the importunity of the villagers who intervened on his behalf.
('15', 410, 2, 4, 802814) Nepali and Japal, nephew and son, respectively, of Hiraman, told me that as a result of the occurrence they were on their way to me.
('15', 410, 2, 5, 802947) The cry was raised that they were going to the thana.
('15', 410, 2, 6, 803001) Your men thereupon ran after them, seized them (so it is stated) and took them to you.
('15', 410, 2, 7, 803088) They added that you whipped them.
('15', 410, 2, 8, 803122) One of them showed strong marks on his calves and on his back.
('15', 410, 2, 9, 803185) They were sent by you to the murghikhana 2 and were fined Rs. 10 each.
('15', 410, 2, 10, 803256) They were released at midnight on their promising to secure the fines in the morning.
('15', 410, 2, 11, 803342) For these fines a guarantee was given by Mahajan Liladhar Sah to your representative the next morning.
('15', 410, 3, 12, 803445) Jadu Rai, of village Katha, son of Man Singh Rai, came to me at Motihari on the 26th instant and said that he held six bighas of land, that he had paid Rs. 75 as tawan in lieu of indigo cultivation, that for failure to supply a plough to the factory and to pay a fine of Rs. 10 in default he was dispossessed of his land and made to sign a document.
('15', 410, 3, 13, 803795) He showed me a receipt No.
('15', 410, 3, 14, 803822) 102 dated 1323 [sic] for Rs. 14.6.9.
('15', 410, 4, 15, 803859) I feel it but right that I should bring to your notice matters of the character above referred to.
('15', 410, 4, 16, 803958) I should esteem it a favour if you would throw light on the incidents I have described.

('15', 411, 2, 3, 804268) BETTIAH, May 30, 1917
('15', 411, 3, 4, 804290) I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th instant on the agrarian situation in Champaran.
('15', 411, 3, 5, 804410) I shall be pleased to wait on His Honour at Ranchi on Monday next, the 4th June, at midday.
('15', 411, 3, 6, 804502) Your letter raises issues which it is impossible for me to ignore if I am faithfully to serve the cause that keeps me in Champaran.
('15', 411, 3, 7, 804634) It is part of the raiyats case that the planters will stop short of nothing to gain their end.
('15', 411, 3, 8, 804729) I have noticed ever since my arrival the very great and undue influence that the planters enjoy over everybody and in everything.
('15', 411, 3, 9, 804859) They have striven their best to have me removed from Champaran.
('15', 411, 3, 10, 804923) They have not hesitated to impute motives to the honourable men who at considerable personal sacrifice have been giving me valuable assistance.
('15', 411, 3, 11, 805067) They have without doubt used at least moral suasion in keeping the raiyats from coming to me.
('15', 411, 3, 12, 805161) At Dhokraha I witnessed the sorrowful spectacle of two or three men declaiming, in the presence of the Manager and the Subdivisional Officer, on the virtues of the kothi in front of a crowd of nearly 500 men who complained bitterly against the kothi about zirat land forced on them and fines exacted from them for disobedience.
('15', 411, 3, 13, 805489) These witnesses were brought by the Manager from Loheria to say that Loheria had no complaint and that the Dhokraha complaints were due to the machinations of one or two agitators.
('15', 411, 3, 14, 805670) Since then many Loheria raiyats have come and complained precisely in the same manner as Dhokraha men.
('15', 411, 3, 15, 805773) It should be noted that if full justice is done to the raiyats, planters stand to lose huge yearly incomes and many privileges they have hitherto enjoyed.
('15', 411, 3, 16, 805928) In the circumstances, I do not entirely discount the statement the raiyats make to me that the fires have been instigated by the kothis in question to discredit my mission and to remove me from their midst.
('15', 411, 3, 17, 806135) The raiyats add that they might be given some credit for selfishness and that their self interest should deter them from incendiarism or such other acts.
('15', 411, 3, 18, 806289) I have submitted to the District Magistrate the results of my inquiry 1 into the Dhokraha fire.
('15', 411, 3, 19, 806385) I beg to enclose copy of my letter to Mr. Heycock 2. I

('15', 412, 1, 2, 806524) am, however, willing to disbelieve the raiyats theory and put down the fire to natural accidents.
('15', 412, 1, 3, 806622) I may add, however, that in the Dhokraha fire, it was the roofing alone that was burnt.
('15', 412, 1, 4, 806710) But I venture to suggest that even if it is the wilful act of a maniacal raiyat done in the excitement caused by my presence; it would be no justification for my removal, unless the Government are satisfied that I have been directly or indirectly instrumental in causing the fires.
('15', 412, 1, 5, 806992) Finally, there have been fires in the kothis before my arrival and that the excitement in Champaran as admitted by the Commissioner was in existence long before I entered Bihar.
('15', 412, 1, 6, 807170) I wish respectfully to warn the Government that they will have utterly misunderstood the position if they remove me from the raiyats.
('15', 412, 1, 7, 807304) I have no desire to do aught except promote peace between the planters and the raiyats so as to secure to the raiyats the freedom and dignity that should belong to all mankind.
('15', 412, 2, 8, 807481) I ask the Government to dismiss from their minds the theory suggested by the planters that the present excitement is caused by mischievous persons for private reasons.
('15', 412, 2, 9, 807649) Planters are too powerful to be touched by any person, no matter how mischievous he may be.
('15', 412, 2, 10, 807741) The raiyats say that they never deserved the police guards that were placed in their villages and that they were part of the policy of repression pursued by the planters.
('15', 412, 2, 11, 807912) It is admitted that in Sathi the Manager was more to blame than the raiyats, and yet the raiyats had to pay with their blood and money.
('15', 412, 2, 12, 808048) It is all peace there now, because the Manager knows his work.
('15', 412, 2, 13, 808111) I have before me statements from over 7,000 raiyats from all parts of Champaran.
('15', 412, 2, 14, 808192) I have seen all of them though I have found it impossible personally to take down their statements.
('15', 412, 2, 15, 808292) It is difficult for me to believe that they all tell lies at the instigation of a few mischievous men.
('15', 412, 3, 16, 808395) I enclose copies of my letters 1 addressed to the Manager of the Motihari concern.
('15', 412, 3, 17, 808478) I have not had any reply to my first communication.
('15', 412, 3, 18, 808530) Probably there is the other side to the story, but the incidents described show at what risk the raiyats come to me.
('15', 412, 3, 19, 808647) I quote what Mr. Johnston 2, one time Subdivisional Officer in Bettiah Subdivision, had to say in 1914 regarding the methods adopted by planters to bend the raiyats to their will:
('15', 412, 4, 20, 808827) There are four methods prevalent in this subdivision compelling recalcitrant tenants to pay up.
('15', 412, 4, 21, 808923) The commonest way is by putting peons on, the petitions do not
('15', 412, 5, 22, 808986) 1 Vide letters to Irwin, 24 5 1917 & 30 5 1917.

('15', 413, 0, 1, 809112) 414 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 413, 1, 2, 809154) allege that this has been done.
('15', 413, 1, 3, 809186) The next way is to attach crops standing on khalihan 1,
('15', 413, 2, 4, 809242) but this also is not alleged.
('15', 413, 2, 5, 809272) Then sometimes the barbers and washermen are stopped from rendering their services; the petitioners only fear this, it has not been done yet.
('15', 413, 2, 6, 809414) Finally, a very effective means is to impound the raiyats cattle either in a private
('15', 413, 3, 7, 809499) pound or if the D. B. pound is leased out to the landlord then in it.
('15', 413, 4, 8, 809569) The report itself is otherwise hostile to the raiyats.
('15', 413, 4, 9, 809624) I am of opinion that it did not do justice to the raiyats.
('15', 413, 4, 10, 809683) I give this opinion in all humility and after having thoroughly gone into the situation.
('15', 413, 4, 11, 809772) It is often forgotten that it is not necessary for the planters to resort to force actually in every case.
('15', 413, 4, 12, 809879) The fact that it is there to be used on the slightest attempt at the show of independence is enough to prevent recalcitrancy.
('15', 413, 4, 13, 810005) I respectfully submit that planters have had it their own way long enough [so] that the raiyats are in a condition of paralysis.
('15', 413, 4, 14, 810134) They are worthy of patient care and attention from the Government.
('15', 413, 4, 15, 810201) But the latter will not render that help, unless they are prepared to believe the raiyats story (exaggerated no doubt it will be) in preference to the planters.
('15', 413, 5, 16, 810362) I tender my apology for the length of this communication.
('15', 413, 5, 17, 810420) If I have been over frank, the cause I espouse must be my excuse.
('15', 413, 5, 18, 810486) It is too great to admit of tinkering.
('15', 413, 5, 19, 810525) I hope that at a crisis like the one that faces the Government and the people of India, the Government do not wish me to conceal my feelings.
('15', 413, 6, 20, 810667) I am deeply grateful to His Honour that he has decided to have a personal conversation with me.
('15', 413, 6, 21, 810763) I shall hope for the sake of the raiyats that nothing I may say or do will adversely affect their cause, and that I shall find the right word in His Honours presence so that he can appreciate the awfulness of the raiyats position even as I do.

('15', 414, 5, 6, 811212) The matters seem to be reaching a crisis as will appear from the enclosed letter 1 from the Government and reply 2 thereto.
('15', 414, 5, 7, 811336) If Mr. Gandhi and his colleagues are removed, it is expected that the leaders will one after another step into the breach.
('15', 414, 5, 8, 811459) In order to do this, it is necessary to realize the inner situation here.
('15', 414, 5, 9, 811533) It is this: raiyats are so paralysed and have suffered so long that they had begun to believe that deliverance was never coming.
('15', 414, 5, 10, 811662) They now feel the warmth of the proximity of their own countrymen who are at least willing to listen to them if they can render no effective help.
('15', 414, 5, 11, 811809) This has been enough to rouse their drooping spirits.
('15', 414, 5, 12, 811863) It will be cruel to leave them unguarded until the question is settled and their independence guaranteed to them.
('15', 414, 5, 13, 811977) Forcible removal of the mission is likely to lead to terrorism and under it to recantation of the statements hitherto made.
('15', 414, 5, 14, 812101) A further note with the papers referred to in the reply to the Chief Secretary will follow.

('15', 415, 3, 6, 812655) I have made no attempt to remember this one.
('15', 415, 4, 7, 812700) I think history and geography, which have been mentioned as separate subjects, should be included under Gujarati.
('15', 415, 4, 8, 812814) We want to develop the intellect through the Gujarati language.
('15', 415, 4, 9, 812878) For that purpose, we may use a language book one day and a text on history the next.
('15', 415, 4, 10, 812963) We should orally go over the matter to be taught and then make [the students] read something on it.
('15', 415, 4, 11, 813063) This will reduce the quantum of literature by a little, but that should not matter.
('15', 415, 4, 12, 813147) If the history and the geography being taught are of the same country, the latter will be easy to learn and prove interesting.
('15', 415, 4, 13, 813274) As for history, to the extent that we treat it as literature, we may give [the students] some well phrased pithy sentences.
('15', 415, 4, 14, 813398) For instance, We look upon Ramachandra as an avatar, as God Himself.
('15', 415, 4, 15, 813467) The term avatar is of Sanskrit origin.
('15', 415, 4, 16, 813506) Avatru means to descend.
('15', 415, 4, 17, 813531) Gods descent (to this earth) is his avatar.
('15', 415, 4, 18, 813575) But at the moment we are not thinking of Rama as an avatar.
('15', 415, 4, 19, 813635) We shall only consider the Rama of history. Whether these sentences have any life in them, you teachers know best.
('15', 415, 4, 20, 813750) But they are good enough to illustrate my point.
('15', 415, 4, 21, 813799) This will cover literature all right.
('15', 415, 4, 22, 813837) We may compose many such sentences as we narrate the history of Ramachandra.
('15', 415, 4, 23, 813914) We may first dictate them or write them out on the blackboard and then tell the story.
('15', 415, 4, 24, 814001) We may deliberately use some difficult words, as we do so.
('15', 415, 4, 25, 814060) The pupils will want to know their meanings and so the discussion will proceed.
('15', 415, 4, 26, 814140) Since he was born in Ayodhya, it will be necessary to explain its geography.
('15', 415, 4, 27, 814217) There will of course be a map.
('15', 415, 4, 28, 814248) How far it is from Ahmedabad, how one may arrive there, what it is like today, whether it answers to the poets description of itall this is literature, history, and geography combined.

('15', 416, 1, 2, 814603) first make up your mind, while telling a story like this, how much literature you wish to teach, how much of history and how much of geography and then be as one with the pupils.
('15', 416, 1, 3, 814782) Sanskrit should be simplified and, if it is grouped with Marathi and the two taught on alternate days, there will be some saving of time.
('15', 416, 1, 4, 814920) It may not be that there will be one or the other of the two languages every day, but the principle will apply.
('15', 416, 1, 5, 815032) We must reduce the hours for each.
('15', 416, 1, 6, 815067) So long as we have only the Ashram boys in the school, there is no need to provide separately for religious instruction.
('15', 416, 1, 7, 815188) It will suffice to tell them the stories we want to at prayer time.
('15', 416, 2, 8, 815256) I am of the view that, if Kaka 1 is an expert in drill, the classes should start and end with it.
('15', 416, 2, 9, 815354) It will be enough to have it for five minutes at the commencement and five minutes at the end.
('15', 416, 2, 10, 815449) This is to be followed after the movements have been learnt.
('15', 416, 2, 11, 815510) Time should be found on one of the week days for teaching the movements.
('15', 416, 2, 12, 815583) What is taught on that day may be practised for a week.
('15', 416, 3, 13, 815639) Agricultural work will be difficult till some land has been obtained.
('15', 416, 3, 14, 815709) Perhaps it will be best to drop it for the time being.
('15', 416, 3, 15, 815764) The man who teaches us should be one who has himself been a successful farmer.
('15', 416, 3, 16, 815843) If a gardener is available, he should remain on the farm and teach us various techniques, which we, teachers and pupils, may learn for a year or two.
('15', 416, 3, 17, 815993) We may then go into the science of agriculture.
('15', 416, 3, 18, 816041) It will not be possible to provide for some hours of agricultural work to all the boys every day.
('15', 416, 3, 19, 816139) But they can learn the work only if every week different classes are given two or three days by turns.
('15', 416, 3, 20, 816242) Forty minutes are not enough for the purpose.
('15', 416, 3, 21, 816288) They may suffice for learning the science of agriculture theoretically.
('15', 416, 3, 22, 816360) The same is true of weaving.
('15', 416, 3, 23, 816389) Both will require constant practice.
('15', 416, 3, 24, 816426) It will be necessary, therefore, to set apart days on which pupils can give at least two hours at a stretch.
('15', 416, 3, 25, 816535) If Shri Pandya knows both the theory and the practice of agriculture and if he agrees to join, no doubt he will be very useful.
('15', 416, 3, 26, 816663) As a rule, a man coming from a Government agricultural school cannot, I believe, be of much help to us.
('15', 416, 3, 27, 816767) Ask Maganlal to tell the story of Nagin Babu of Santiniketan.
('15', 416, 3, 28, 816829) It was not his fault.
('15', 416, 3, 29, 816851) How could he help it?
('15', 416, 4, 30, 816873) It is not necessary to teach carpentry till a boy is twelve.
('15', 416, 4, 31, 816934) A child is not able even to lift or use a hammer.
('15', 416, 4, 32, 816984) At a later age, we shall have no option but to teach it.
('15', 416, 4, 33, 817041) It should be treated as a part of agriculture.

('15', 417, 1, 2, 817141) This is not done in India.
('15', 417, 1, 3, 817168) It is, however, a kind of work which we shall not be able to do till we have moved to our own land.
('15', 417, 1, 4, 817268) You must find a Gujarati equivalent for workshop.
('15', 417, 1, 5, 817318) Will karakhanu do?
('15', 417, 1, 6, 817337) Someone had mentioned metric system in the curriculum.
('15', 417, 1, 7, 817392) Henceforward, we should be careful about using such terms.
('15', 417, 1, 8, 817451) There are so many points like these over which we have to break our heads.
('15', 417, 1, 9, 817526) If you do that, our children will enjoy the fruits.
('15', 417, 1, 10, 817578) It will be enough to give every division one hour weekly for hygiene.
('15', 417, 1, 11, 817648) The teacher should keep a watch whether the things taught in these hours are acted upon during the rest of the week.
('15', 417, 1, 12, 817765) Because the pupil doesnt have another hour for the subject on the other days, it does not mean that the teacher has forgotten what he taught in that week.
('15', 417, 1, 13, 817920) If a boy attends the school with his nails grown and filled with dirt, the teacher can ask him, even during the period for arithmetic, why his nails are dirty and what he had been taught on this point.
('15', 417, 1, 14, 818122) It is certain that Professor (what is the Gujarati for this?
('15', 417, 1, 15, 818183) Or, will it have to be retained in the language just as it is?) Kripalani will join.
('15', 417, 1, 16, 818268) He will take a trial for some time.
('15', 417, 1, 17, 818304) If the thing is not beyond his capacity, he will join.
('15', 417, 1, 18, 818359) For the present, he just cannot get away from here.
('15', 417, 1, 19, 818411) I have written at length on some points, saying things which may appear rather silly.
('15', 417, 1, 20, 818497) My anxiety to make myself quite clear was the reason.
('15', 417, 2, 21, 818551) Vandemataram from
('15', 417, 3, 22, 818569) MOHANDAS Something remains yet.
('15', 417, 3, 23, 818601) Music will have to be left out till we get a teacher for it.
('15', 417, 3, 24, 818662) Since due weight is not attached to it, the thing has remained with actors and bhaktas 1. We must consider before taking in an actor.
('15', 417, 3, 25, 818796) A bhakta we are not likely to get.
('15', 417, 3, 26, 818831) Write to the Gandharva [Maha]vidyalaya and see if you succeed.
('15', 417, 3, 27, 818894) Will you please send a list of the equipment needed for science?
('15', 417, 3, 28, 818959) I hesitate to buy costly equipment before we have become stable.
('15', 417, 3, 29, 819024) If any books are wanting, it will be good if you make a list of them as well.
('15', 417, 3, 30, 819102) Please treat all my observations as no more than suggestions for consideration.
('15', 417, 3, 31, 819182) Whether or not they should be implemented is left to the inclinations of you all.

('15', 418, 5, 6, 819509) CHHAGANLAL, I have received letters of both of you.
('15', 418, 5, 7, 819561) The situation here has taken a serious turn.
('15', 418, 5, 8, 819606) 1 Hence I shall not be able to write fully.
('15', 418, 6, 9, 819650) If it is absolutely necessary to go to Rajkot, it seems proper that you go there.
('15', 418, 6, 10, 819732) Maganlal certainly cannot leave.
('15', 418, 6, 11, 819765) I very well realize that even you cannot leave.
('15', 418, 6, 12, 819813) But I am certain that one of you should be there.
('15', 418, 6, 13, 819863) If something untoward happened all of us would repent.
('15', 418, 6, 14, 819918) If Fulchand can be persuaded to go to Ahmedabad you should entrust him with your work and go.
('15', 418, 6, 15, 820012) And I suggest appointing another clerk.
('15', 418, 7, 16, 820052) If it is possible to shift to a new place for the monsoon this should be done.
('15', 418, 7, 17, 820131) But do not insist upon it too much.
('15', 418, 7, 18, 820167) If the curriculum seems too strenuous, some adjustments should be made.
('15', 418, 7, 19, 820239) However, neither weaving nor agriculture should be neglected.

('15', 419, 3, 5, 820969) The problem here has suddenly taken so serious a turn that it has become doubtful whether I will get the time to look into the papers you have sent me.
('15', 419, 3, 6, 821121) You will read the report of the whole affair 2. This at least I feel .

('15', 419, 3, 10, 821340) One or two additional teachers will be needed.
('15', 419, 3, 11, 821387) Look for them.

('15', 420, 1, 3, 822598) I think they do everything except making the woof in the jail.
('15', 420, 1, 4, 822661) I feel that we should see how a woof made of yarn works.
('15', 420, 1, 5, 822718) If the instrument meant for use as woof can be made of yarn, it may be necessary to have it for finer work like that of silk.
('15', 420, 1, 6, 822844) At present we have to see how much we can weave without the help of machines.

('15', 421, 1, 3, 824247) You should explain to him politely but firmly that dharma does not consist in these notions about being defiled by contactwith this or the other thing.
('15', 421, 1, 4, 824399) As Akha has sung: That one may be defiled by touch of others, like a superfluous limb is this notion. Here, I am being showered with love.
('15', 421, 1, 5, 824538) There is no end to peoples suffering.
('15', 421, 1, 6, 824576) I am getting a wonderful experience of villages.
('15', 421, 2, 7, 824625) If Mavji is otherwise a good man, fix a pay for him.
('15', 421, 2, 8, 824678) It is necessary that such men get trained and pick up everything about weaving, so that we can employ thousands of them.
('15', 421, 3, 9, 824799) Show all the accounts to the gentleman who has come forward to pay the expenses of the Ashram.
('15', 421, 3, 10, 824894) If he does, I see nothing wrong in accepting what he gives.
('15', 421, 3, 11, 824954) I am writing 1 to Prabhudas to tell him that he may now come here if he wants to.
('15', 421, 3, 12, 825036) It is quite true that, had Chhaganlal been late this time, he would have been too late to be of any help.
('15', 421, 3, 13, 825142) As things have by chance come off in time at the last hour, one feels as if everything has been all right.
('15', 421, 4, 14, 825249) You want to know when my work here will be over.
('15', 421, 4, 15, 825298) From the magnitude of the task, it would seem that it might take years.
('15', 421, 4, 16, 825370) If I go by my faith, I think it will take six months.
('15', 421, 4, 17, 825424) I have here men of sterling worth to help me.
('15', 421, 4, 18, 825470) More are likely to join.
('15', 421, 4, 19, 825495) I continue to have Gods mercy in abundance.
('15', 421, 4, 20, 825539) It is not true that Prabhudass brain has grown dull for want of milk.
('15', 421, 4, 21, 825609) Chhaganlal wonders if this is so.The reason is to be found in Prabhudass passing from one phase of growth to another.
('15', 421, 4, 22, 825727) When passing through an important change of this kind, many people feel disturbed in one way or another.
('15', 421, 4, 23, 825832) Moreover, as I could see while teaching Prabhudas, he worked very hard competing with Devdas.
('15', 421, 4, 24, 825926) He has some excellent qualities.
('15', 421, 4, 25, 825959) He has exerted himself beyond his limits, considering his age and capacity.
('15', 421, 4, 26, 826035) He feels exhausted now.
('15', 421, 5, 27, 826059) Blessings from

('15', 422, 3, 4, 826285) DEAR MR. HEYCOCK, I think I promised to refer you to the report from which I had quoted to you regarding the methods the factories adopted to make the raiyats to do their will.
('15', 422, 3, 5, 826462) 1 This report is dated the 22nd July 1914 and is signed by Mr. E. H. Johnston, S.D.O., Bettiah.

('15', 423, 2, 3, 827233) BETTIAH, Jeth Sud 11, Samvat 1973 [June 1, 1917]
('15', 423, 3, 4, 827282) MAGANLAL, The friend Kishorelal about whom Chandulal wrote has arrived here.
('15', 423, 3, 5, 827359) But his health is not too good and I am sending him back.
('15', 423, 3, 6, 827417) He is a fine man.
('15', 423, 3, 7, 827435) I have suggested to him that he may join the school.
('15', 423, 3, 8, 827488) I take it that you will let him join.
('15', 423, 3, 9, 827526) In the letter I posted this morning, I could not complete the point towards the end.
('15', 423, 3, 10, 827611) If Fulchand and Narahari were not included among the inmates, the idea was to suggest that, at the critical hour, they should be free to get some experience of jail here if they so desire.
('15', 423, 3, 11, 827800) It is because of Sankalchand that the school has started.
('15', 423, 3, 12, 827858) Even if he wants to, he cannot come here.
('15', 423, 3, 13, 827900) I cannot imagine the school without Kaka at present.
('15', 423, 3, 14, 827953) Sankalchand cannot run it by himself.
('15', 423, 3, 15, 827991) And so Kaka must remain.
('15', 423, 3, 16, 828016) He doesnt have anything more to learn here.
('15', 423, 3, 17, 828060) I think he is a veteran.
('15', 423, 3, 18, 828085) He can work hard enough.
('15', 423, 3, 19, 828110) What he has to learn is to serve, tied down to one spot, and he has now such an opportunity.
('15', 423, 3, 20, 828203) Mama can work half the time in the school and half on the loom or he can work all the time on the loom.
('15', 423, 3, 21, 828307) He is much in the same position as Kaka.
('15', 423, 3, 22, 828348) All that is to be learnt here is to suffer, when the hour comes, and go to jail.
('15', 423, 3, 23, 828429) Mama has passed the test in this school.
('15', 423, 3, 24, 828470) Without Chhotalal, how could you run the loom by yourself?
('15', 423, 3, 25, 828529) For him, moreover, going to jail is a kind of indulgence, so to say.
('15', 423, 3, 26, 828598) Jail is no hardship to him.
('15', 423, 3, 27, 828626) If there is hardship anywhere, it is there.
('15', 423, 3, 28, 828670) That, too, he bears and will go on bearing.
('15', 423, 3, 29, 828714) If Santok remains there, the girls will be looked after and Vrajlal can also be free of the kitchen.
('15', 423, 3, 30, 828815) Chhaganlal can be spared if Khushalbhai has gone over there.
('15', 423, 3, 31, 828876) Punjabhai will then keep accounts as well as he may.
('15', 423, 3, 32, 828929) Who will be asking for them?
('15', 423, 3, 33, 828958) This is the arrangement that occurs to me.
('15', 423, 3, 34, 829001) No one from among the teachers is obliged to join in work of this kind, nor do I expect them to.
('15', 423, 3, 35, 829098) All that I have suggested is that, even if any of them want to join, only two can be spared.
('15', 423, 3, 36, 829191) For the immediate present, however, I dont see the need for anyone besides Devdas to come.
('15', 423, 3, 37, 829282) When you, Mama and Chhotalal have acquired full mastery over the loom, you yourselves will take up the fight, without depending on me, for the uplift of handloom workers.
('15', 423, 3, 38, 829453) When Sankalchand and others are in full
('15', 424, 0, 1, 829493) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 425
('15', 424, 1, 2, 829535) command of the National School, the teachers will themselves take up the struggle for the spread of that type of education everywhere.
('15', 424, 1, 3, 829670) If I am a free man and alive, I shall join in that effort too.
('15', 424, 1, 4, 829733) If not, this struggle will have shown the way to you all.
('15', 424, 1, 5, 829791) One pointed is the intellect that functions with a purpose, son of Kuru!
('15', 424, 1, 6, 829864) Many branched and infinite are the movements of the intellect devoid of purpose.
('15', 424, 2, 7, 829945) This covers everything.
('15', 424, 2, 8, 829969) Once we have decided what we want and are resolved not to be deterred by anything that may follow, the developments will show us the way.
('15', 424, 2, 9, 830107) There is not much to be learnt in how I listen to peoples tales [of suffering] and take the, statements.
('15', 424, 2, 10, 830212) This contains a reply to Mamas letter too.
('15', 424, 2, 11, 830255) Show him the whole letter.
('15', 424, 2, 12, 830282) It seems you have forgotten about the letter to Narandas, or the one from him, that you were to send to me.
('15', 424, 2, 13, 830390) You may employ any labour that may be necessary except for weaving.
('15', 424, 2, 14, 830458) As to the charges, we can go as far as reasonable market rates.
('15', 424, 2, 15, 830522) What you say about the plan of the house seems all right to me.
('15', 424, 2, 16, 830586) If you go to live there, put up the hedge immediately.
('15', 424, 2, 17, 830641) What it will be of, you may consider and decide.
('15', 424, 2, 18, 830690) I have already given the plan I should like.
('15', 424, 2, 19, 830735) See that the verandahs around the house are wide enough.
('15', 424, 2, 20, 830792) It will be all right to have the teachers rooms in front, as also those for Lalji and others.
('15', 424, 2, 21, 830886) I cant think [about the arrangement] for respected Khushalbhai.
('15', 424, 2, 22, 830950) You may do so yourself.
('15', 424, 2, 23, 830974) It also remains to be seen what he decides in response to my letter 2. I think we shall have to spend up to Rs. 20,000 on the buildings; we can manage that.
('15', 424, 2, 24, 831131) We shall be receiving Rs. 2,000 annually from Doctor Saheb.
('15', 424, 2, 25, 831191) He has not so far paid the sum [for this year] but I take it that he will do so now.
('15', 424, 2, 26, 831276) Let him know your needs.
('15', 424, 2, 27, 831301) I am treating the land as a separate item.
('15', 424, 2, 28, 831344) If you think it necessary to use full baked bricks for the construction of the buildings, do so.
('15', 424, 2, 29, 831441) The Executive Engineer there is Mr. Tyobji.
('15', 424, 2, 30, 831485) He will help you.
('15', 424, 2, 31, 831503) Punjabhai was with me when he took me to see the jail.
('15', 424, 2, 32, 831558) Yes, it is quite right to pay the salaries from the Ashram reserves.
('15', 424, 2, 33, 831627) We shall see what to do when some one donates money for the school.
('15', 424, 2, 34, 831695) The teachers quarters will also be constructed out of

('15', 425, 1, 2, 831829) the Ashram funds.
('15', 425, 1, 3, 831847) They should, if they can, pay rent at the rate of six per cent, or any other rate which may be considered reasonable, onthe cost of the land and all the other expenses.
('15', 425, 1, 4, 832016) This answers all your points.

('15', 425, 4, 6, 832062) What Chhaganlal says about Jivanlalbhai having been paid up to the 15th is not right.
('15', 425, 4, 7, 832148) I have already arranged that a fortnights salary should be remitted to him in advance and that subsequently he should be paid on the first of every month.
('15', 425, 4, 8, 832303) You can make sure by looking into the cheque book and consulting Fulchand.
('15', 425, 4, 9, 832378) It is not our idea that we should meet our expenses in the future out of the interest.
('15', 425, 4, 10, 832465) As far as possible, we shall live within whatever we receive, unasked, for the expenses.
('15', 425, 4, 11, 832554) But, to the extent that we fail in our tapascharya, we shall appeal for donations.
('15', 425, 4, 12, 832637) This is the way all great undertakings in the world are carried on.
('15', 425, 4, 13, 832705) Institutions which are maintained out of interest lose vitality in the end.
('15', 425, 4, 14, 832781) People will maintain any institution that they need.
('15', 425, 4, 15, 832834) If the Shriji [temple] were without its rich wealth, the priests would be more concerned with their spiritual state.
('15', 425, 4, 16, 832951) The teachers need not get alarmed by this view of mine or by the proposed arrangement.
('15', 425, 4, 17, 833038) In the notes lying with Shukla Saheb 1 and Revashankarbhai, there is sufficient reserve to meet their needs for four years.
('15', 425, 4, 18, 833162) I have, all the same, written to the Doctor asking him to undertake the responsibility of meeting all the expenses for the present, and I think he will.
('15', 425, 4, 19, 833315) Send him a complete estimate for the year.
('15', 425, 4, 20, 833358) When I am outside [jail] the question does not arise.

('15', 426, 2, 3, 833622) RANCHI, June 4, 1917
('15', 426, 3, 4, 833643) DEAR MAHARAJA SAHEB BAHADUR 1, In accordance with your suggestion, I reduce to writing my views about the proposed inquiry.
('15', 426, 3, 5, 833767) In my opinion, simultaneously with the appointment of a Committee of Enquiry (or arbitration, as suggested herein below), there should be declaration regarding the various points referred to in my letter to the Government dated the 13th May last.
('15', 426, 3, 6, 834014) 2 Tinkathia in every shape and form, hand notes being balances of tawan and hundas as in the Dhokraha kothi, should be declared as abolished or cancelled.
('15', 426, 3, 7, 834169) I have no desire, if I can help it, to lead evidence as to the coercive methods adopted by the planters to bend the raiyats to their will except in so far as it may be necessary regarding sharahbeshi and tawan.
('15', 426, 3, 8, 834380) I am anxious to see cordial relations established between the planters and the raiyats.
('15', 426, 3, 9, 834468) And in any inquiry that is the result of a mutual understanding, an investigation into methods of coercion can find no place.
('15', 426, 3, 10, 834594) There would then remain only the question of sharahbeshi, sattas and individual hardships, in the shape of raiyats having been dispossessed of their lands, etc., and the refund of tawan and sharahbeshi already taken.
('15', 426, 3, 11, 834811) These the Committee will investigate.
('15', 426, 3, 12, 834849) Sharahbeshi payments should meanwhile be suspended.
('15', 426, 3, 13, 834901) The Committee will confine its attention to sharahbeshi sattas not covered by the forthcoming judgment of the High Court, the latter to be accepted as final by both the parties.
('15', 426, 3, 14, 835079) Inquiry into sharahbeshi sattas will then naturally be postponed till after the judgment of the High Court.
('15', 426, 3, 15, 835187) Upon the Committee being appointed, the scope of our work will be altered.
('15', 426, 3, 16, 835262) It will then consist in collecting, collating and leading evidence and in simultaneously carrying out the educative and

('15', 427, 1, 2, 835545) protective programme sketched before you.
('15', 427, 1, 3, 835587) Such a Committee, then, may be in the nature of an arbitration of which the planters and the raiyats nominees (one of each) will be members with the right to them to appoint an umpire.
('15', 427, 1, 4, 835772) The decision of the arbitration should be treated as final and binding on both the parties.
('15', 427, 1, 5, 835864) Behind it, in the place of judicial authority, will be that of the Government, if either party failed to carry out the award of the arbitration.
('15', 427, 1, 6, 836009) This is a domestic quarrel and if it is settled in the manner indicated by me, it will create a healthy precedent.
('15', 427, 1, 7, 836124) If, however, it may not be in the nature of an arbitration, it will then be a Committee appointed by the Government, two members being the same as under the arbitration scheme and the president being a High Court Judge.
('15', 427, 1, 8, 836344) If there is any point herein which requires elucidation and if it is so desired, I shall be prepared to wait on the Council at any time required.
('15', 427, 2, 9, 836490) I remain,

('15', 427, 8, 14, 836637) June 5, 1917
('15', 427, 9, 15, 836650) I discussed with Mr. Gandhi this afternoon, Chief Secretary being present, the question of the step to be taken in connection with the Champaran situation.
('15', 427, 9, 16, 836806) I explained to Mr. Gandhi that he had now had ample time to obtain all the information he needed, and that the raiyats were getting in an excited state, and it was ecessary in
('15', 427, 10, 17, 836982) some way to put an end to a situation which was rapidly becoming a d angerous one.
('15', 427, 10, 18, 837065) It is impossible for Mr. Gandhi himself to settle the questions which have been raised, as the planters would not recognise his authority; also for him to attempt to do so would be assuming the functions of Government.
('15', 427, 10, 19, 837284) Government had intended to postpone their consideration of the points at issue until the settlement report had been received, but they recognise that, in present circumstances, this is no longer possible.
('15', 427, 10, 20, 837489) It was decided, therefore, to appoint a Committee consisting of a senior
('15', 427, 11, 21, 837562) 1 This is a note by Lt. Governor, shown to Gandhiji and altered by him.
('15', 428, 0, 1, 837634) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 429
('15', 428, 1, 2, 837676) revenue officer from another province (Mr. Sly) as President, and the following members:Mr. Rainy, Deputy Secretary, Financial Department, Government of India; Mr. Adami, Legal Remembrancer; Mr. D. Reid, representative of the planters on the Legislative Council; Raja Harihar Prasad Narayan Singh of Amawan, as the representative of the zamindars; and Mr. Gandhi himself as the representative of the raiyats.
('15', 428, 1, 3, 838085) The appointment of the last three gentleman, of course, could only be made
('15', 428, 2, 4, 838160) with their consent, and I asked Mr. Gandhi if he would agree to serve.
('15', 428, 2, 5, 838231) He said at first that he would prefer to remain outside the Committee, so that he might lead the evidence.
('15', 428, 2, 6, 838338) But, after some discussion, he admitted that there were advantages in his being on the Committee, provided that it was recognised by Government that he had his own pronounced views which he might not readily change, and also that he would wish to place his own evidence before the Committee in the form of a written statement, on which the other members of the Committee would of course examine him.
('15', 428, 2, 7, 838738) He also wished that he might be given freedom to produce witnesses for examination.
('15', 428, 2, 8, 838822) I said that even if he were on the Committee, he would have as much freedom in these respects as if he had remained outside it.
('15', 428, 2, 9, 838950) Mr. Gandhi then asked for time to consult Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya, and promised to let me know his decision as soon as he had seen that gentleman at Bankipore.
('15', 428, 3, 10, 839114) Mr. Gandhi agreed that the following terms of reference to the Committee were suitable, namely:
('15', 428, 4, 11, 839210) To enquire into the relations between landlord and tenant in the Champaran district as also into all disputes arising out of the manufacture and cultivation of indigo.
('15', 428, 4, 12, 839378) The Committee to examine the material already available, supplementing it by such further enquiry, local and otherwise, as they consider desirable.
('15', 428, 4, 13, 839526) They should report their conclusions to Government, if possible by the 15th October, and state the measures they recommend in order to remove any abuse or grievance which they might find to exist.
('15', 428, 5, 14, 839723) Mr. Gandhi asked if it might be taken as certain that the above terms of reference covered all the points I mentioned in his note of 13th May 1, including the question of sharahbeshi sattas, although a case relating to them is pending in the
('15', 428, 6, 15, 839965) High Court.
('15', 428, 6, 16, 839977) I replied in the affirmative.
('15', 428, 7, 17, 840007) Mr. Gandhi presumed that the term material already available would include any evidence which he might wish to tender.
('15', 428, 7, 18, 840126) I again replied in the affirmative.
('15', 428, 8, 19, 840162) Mr. Gandhi said that in his opinion the proceedings of the Committee should be of an informal and summary nature.
('15', 428, 8, 20, 840276) I said I was inclined to agree but thought this might be left to the discretion of the Commissioners.
('15', 428, 9, 21, 840378) Mr. Gandhi, on his part, undertakes at once to put a stop to his
('15', 428, 10, 22, 840443) 1 Vide Report on Condition of Ryots in Champaran, 13 5 1917.
('15', 429, 0, 1, 840504) 430 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 429, 1, 2, 840546) enquiry and to abstain henceforth from taking a single statement, and also from visiting any dehat or allowing any of his assistants to do so.
('15', 429, 1, 3, 840689) Mr. Gandhi does not want the raiyats to feel that
('15', 429, 2, 4, 840739) A he has deserted them, and is unwilling on that account to leave the district altogether, pending the assembly of the Committee.
('15', 429, 2, 5, 840869) But he undertakes not to go beyond Bettiah and Motihari; after short visits to these places, he will go on a visit to Ahmedabad.
('15', 429, 3, 6, 840998) Mr. Gandhi asked that orders should issue at once putting a stop to illegal acts, such as the levy of abwabs and the impressment of labour.
('15', 429, 3, 7, 841138) I said we could not do this
('15', 429, 4, 8, 841166) unless at the same time we issued a notice which the planters asked us to issue, stating
('15', 429, 5, 9, 841255) that Mr. Gandhi had no official recognition.
('15', 429, 5, 10, 841300) Mr. Gandhi said he would be quite
('15', 429, 6, 11, 841334) willing to see both statements made; but finally he agreed that in lieu of any such
('15', 429, 7, 12, 841418) notice precise instructions should be issued to the local officers to take vigorous
('15', 429, 8, 13, 841502) action to prevent all abuses that may come to light.
('15', 429, 8, 14, 841555) For instance, the taking of abwabs must, as far as possible, be finally stopped, use being made where necessary
('15', 429, 9, 15, 841667) of the power of refusing to renew leases.
('15', 429, 9, 16, 841709) Similarly, the illegal impressment of labour,
('15', 429, 10, 17, 841755) carts and ploughs must by all means be prevented wherever it comes to notice.
('15', 429, 11, 18, 841833) Mr. Gandhi asked that warnings should be sent to planters not to impress carts or coolies or collect abwabs, etc., during the interval which will elapse before the
('15', 429, 12, 19, 841997) report of the Committee is received.
('15', 429, 12, 20, 842034) I replied that the planters would take offence, if Government were to issue such a warning, as it would imply a prejudging of their case, but said that when the planter member of the Committee is appointed, I would point out to him the harm that would be done if such practices occurred, and ask him to consider the desirability of making such a communication to his brother planters.
('15', 429, 13, 21, 842419) The following action should now be taken:
('15', 429, 14, 22, 842461) (1) The Government of India should be informed briefly of the decision arrived at, and it should be mentioned that Mr. Tanner has been selected as Secretary instead of Mr. Tallents.
('15', 429, 15, 23, 842643) (2) Mr. Reid and the Raja of Amawan should be asked if they will serve on the Committee.
('15', 429, 16, 24, 842732) (3) A letter should be sent to the Commissioner informing him of the fact that it has been decided to refer the whole question of the agrarian conditions in Champaran to a Committee, the constitution of which will be communicated to him as soon as possible and that, meanwhile, Mr. Gandhi has agreed (as at A above).
('15', 429, 16, 25, 843049) The Planters Association should also be informed of the decision arrived at.
('15', 429, 17, 26, 843126) (4) A short resolution to be drafted appointing the Committee, so that it

('15', 431, 6, 8, 844848) The indigo planters are out to make trouble and therefore my return might be delayed.
('15', 431, 6, 9, 844934) l will see.
('15', 431, 6, 10, 844946) Herewith a postcard.
('15', 431, 6, 11, 844967) If, as slated in it, the man comes there, take him in.
('15', 431, 6, 12, 845022) If he knows Hindi, entrust him with teaching work.
('15', 431, 6, 13, 845073) Otherwise, any other work you think him fit for.
('15', 431, 6, 14, 845122) I have asked him to go there directly.
('15', 431, 6, 15, 845161) As for your going to Rajkot, do what you think is proper.
('15', 431, 7, 16, 845219) Prabhudass body is getting quite strong.
('15', 431, 7, 17, 845260) Though he still suffers from headaches, that does not matter.
('15', 431, 7, 18, 845322) Very fine work was done at Ranchi.
('15', 431, 7, 19, 845357) 3 Devdas has given you a full report.
('15', 431, 7, 20, 845395) I myself am not in a position to write more.
('15', 431, 7, 21, 845440) The reports which Devdas sends also should not appear in the newspapers.
('15', 431, 8, 22, 845513) Blessings from
('15', 431, 9, 23, 845528) BAPU [PS.] Bhai Pragji has asked for money.
('15', 431, 9, 24, 845572) I have told him that volunteers must not be enlisted by paying them.
('15', 431, 9, 25, 845641) Boarding and lodging is all that may be offered to them.
('15', 431, 9, 26, 845698) The travelling expenses also should be borne by them.
('15', 431, 9, 27, 845752) I see no harm in the matter relating to the Doctor being printed in Rajkot.
('15', 431, 9, 28, 845828) But the cost must not exceed what it would be in Ahmedabad.

('15', 431, 12, 33, 846254) Gandhiji was appointed a member of the Committee as a representative of the peasants.

('15', 432, 2, 3, 846412) BETTIAH, June 9, 1917
('15', 432, 3, 4, 846434) MY DEAR ESTHER, As you will have seen from the papers sent to you, I have been to Ranchi, from which place I returned only yesterday to find your letters.
('15', 432, 3, 5, 846589) Yours is a difficult question to answer.
('15', 432, 3, 6, 846630) The total effect of Euro pean activity has not been for the good of India.
('15', 432, 3, 7, 846705) The general body of Europeans who have come to India have succumbed to the vices of the East instead of imposing their own virtues on the East.
('15', 432, 3, 8, 846849) It could not well be otherwise.
('15', 432, 3, 9, 846881) Religion has not made a lasting impression on them, as we see demonstrated even by the present war.
('15', 432, 3, 10, 846981) My theory is that modern civilization is decidedly anti Christian.
('15', 432, 3, 11, 847048) And what Europeans have brought to India is that civilization, not the life of Jesus.
('15', 432, 3, 12, 847134) You and a handful of others are striving to represent that life.
('15', 432, 3, 13, 847199) It is bound to leave its mark upon the soil.
('15', 432, 3, 14, 847244) But it must take time.
('15', 432, 3, 15, 847267) The mills of God grind slowly. You and people like you are not affected by the evil that stares you in the face.
('15', 432, 3, 16, 847380) You get behind it, discover the good lying underneath and add it to your own stock, thus producing a perfect blend.
('15', 432, 3, 17, 847496) What I want is a reciprocity of that method.
('15', 432, 3, 18, 847541) And so I welcomed your visit to the Ashram, as I welcome that of many European friends who are true to their best traditions and are broadminded enough to take in the best that this land has to give.
('15', 432, 3, 19, 847741) Have I made myself clear?
('15', 432, 3, 20, 847767) Please discuss this further and freely with me.
('15', 432, 3, 21, 847815) I am likely to serve on the Committee the Government are about to appoint.
('15', 432, 3, 22, 847890) I am presently framing a general note 1 which will give you the details of the visit to Ranchi.
('15', 432, 3, 23, 847986) It was a good thing I went.
('15', 432, 3, 24, 848014) Mrs. Gandhi and Devdas are here now and so is Polak.
('15', 432, 3, 25, 848067) Had I been arrested, Mrs. Gandhi and Devdas would have worked among the poor raiyats and heartened them for the struggle.
('15', 432, 3, 26, 848189) I am most anxious for you to meet Mrs. Gandhi at the earliest moment.
('15', 432, 3, 27, 848259) Please dont think that I am killing myself with work.

('15', 433, 3, 5, 848661) I was able to extract the contents without much difficulty.
('15', 433, 3, 6, 848721) The taking of statements in Bettiah has been stopped as from yesterday.
('15', 433, 3, 7, 848793) I am going to Motihari tomorrow to stop the taking of statements there.

('15', 433, 10, 14, 849114) BHAISHRI [RAOJIBHAI], I have your letter.
('15', 433, 10, 15, 849156) I was a little sad to read it.
('15', 433, 10, 16, 849187) You depict your condition to be very miserable.
('15', 433, 10, 17, 849235) One does so to some extent and then gets out of it.
('15', 433, 10, 18, 849287) But this letter of yours instead of showing such spirit creates an impression that you are never going to get out of your melancholy.
('15', 433, 10, 19, 849421) I shall be very much disappointed if such is going to be the result.
('15', 433, 10, 20, 849490) I have entertained high hopes about you and expected that you will ultimately get strong and will most certainly put up a fight.
('15', 433, 10, 21, 849619) There is no need of volunteers just now.
('15', 433, 10, 22, 849660) They will be required after four months.
('15', 433, 10, 23, 849701) You will be able to play your part as a volunteer only if you shake off your melancholy and get strong.
('15', 433, 10, 24, 849805) You will have to do the work without any remuneration.

('15', 434, 7, 11, 850385) The Associated Press message 1 becomes a perfect mystery if it is taken for granted, as I think it must be, that the leakage could not have taken place from my side.
('15', 434, 7, 12, 850551) Apart from the intrinsic evidence the message bears of not having been received from my side, I may say that I had given the details of the interview to no one in Bankipore before 6 p.m., i.e., till after the arrival of the Honble Pundit Malaviyaji and several things alluded to in the message were not even mentioned during the conversation 2 I had with Mr. Malaviyaji and four other friends.

('15', 434, 14, 20, 851209) I received your booklet 3 as I was going to the station.

('15', 435, 1, 2, 851454) have years ago in South Africa.
('15', 435, 1, 3, 851486) I read the booklet years ago when I found myself in the company of some very dear Christian friends.
('15', 435, 1, 4, 851587) I have read it again today with better appreciation if one may write in this manner of a sacred work like this.
('15', 435, 1, 5, 851699) For me truth and love are interchangeable terms.
('15', 435, 1, 6, 851748) You may not know that the Gujarati for passive resistance is truth force.
('15', 435, 1, 7, 851822) I have variously defined it as truth force, love force or soul force.
('15', 435, 1, 8, 851892) But truly there is nothing in words.
('15', 435, 1, 9, 851929) What one has to do is to live a life of love in the midst of the hate we see everywhere.
('15', 435, 1, 10, 852018) And we cannot do it without unconquerable faith in its efficacy.
('15', 435, 1, 11, 852083) A great queen named Mirabai lived two or three hundred years ago.
('15', 435, 1, 12, 852149) She forsook her husband and everything and lived a life of absolute love.
('15', 435, 1, 13, 852223) Her husband at last became her devotee.
('15', 435, 1, 14, 852263) We often sing in the Ashram some fine hymns composed by her.
('15', 435, 1, 15, 852324) You shall hear and one of these days sing them when you come to the Ashram.

('15', 436, 2, 3, 852746) MOTIHARI , Jeth Vad 6 [June 11, 1917] 1
('15', 436, 3, 4, 852786) CHHAGANLAL, I have come to Motihari for a day.
('15', 436, 3, 5, 852833) I have noticed that by mistake, Devdas has put the letter in my bag.
('15', 436, 3, 6, 852902) I am returning it.
('15', 436, 3, 7, 852921) I saw here the Nitishatak which was sent for Prabhudas.
('15', 436, 3, 8, 852977) It carries a shloka, the meaning of which is given thus: Just as a good woman wants her breasts pinched with nails as sharp as sword, similarly a brave man wants his chestthe symbol of victory, attacked by swords as sharp as nails.
('15', 436, 3, 9, 853209) I felt very unhappy on reading it.
('15', 436, 3, 10, 853244) There is hardly any book which does not carry something that needs to be omitted before we put it into the hands of the children.
('15', 436, 3, 11, 853374) How could Bhartrihari write such shlokas in his Nitishatak.
('15', 436, 3, 12, 853434) Only in an age of extreme debauchery can one think of such thoughts.
('15', 436, 3, 13, 853503) I find it simply impossible that any woman, leading a disciplined life, would want her breasts pinched or any good man would enjoy making such assaults.
('15', 436, 3, 14, 853656) That suggests a highly debauched state.
('15', 436, 3, 15, 853696) A good woman can never be in such a state.
('15', 436, 3, 16, 853739) Such comparison cannot even be thought of while writing shlokas for the Nitishatak.
('15', 436, 3, 17, 853823) That such shlokas and ideas are found even in good collections, brings to mind two things.
('15', 436, 3, 18, 853914) First, that in our original books, the periods of debauchery and self control have been mixed up.
('15', 436, 3, 19, 854012) Second, that the compilers of this age give little thought to the contents of the literature they place before the society.
('15', 436, 3, 20, 854136) Under these circumstances, we have to give books to the children after careful consideration of the contents.
('15', 436, 3, 21, 854246) After reading the above mentioned shloka, an innocent child like Prabhudas would feel that to pinch a young womans breasts is not something bad and that even a righteous man can derive such pleasure.
('15', 436, 3, 22, 854446) We will have to make great efforts to improve this atmosphere and save our youth.
('15', 436, 3, 23, 854528) Some of these writings should be shown to the young people and then the viciousness pointed out.
('15', 436, 3, 24, 854625) For, we cannot keep such vicious books hidden from them for long.
('15', 436, 3, 25, 854691) So I feel that whatever book we give to

('15', 437, 1, 3, 855045) I feel the need for our teachers to deliberate over such books.
('15', 437, 1, 4, 855109) They, too, have to learn quite a lot and think quite a lot.
('15', 437, 1, 5, 855169) Even books like the Bhagawat should be read out to the children and they may not be allowed to keep it with them.

('15', 437, 3, 8, 855344) There is a dhoti in it.
('15', 437, 3, 9, 855368) But the dhotis woven by Valji have spoiled me.
('15', 437, 3, 10, 855415) The spoiled me hesitated to wear coarse cloth.
('15', 437, 3, 11, 855462) I will try to console myself arguing that one should not differentiate between fine and coarse cloth in a gift of hand woven khadi which is a rare thing.
('15', 437, 3, 12, 855616) Devdas too has given me some pieces.
('15', 437, 3, 13, 855653) It is difficult for me to say whether I will be able to come there or not.

('15', 438, 1, 5, 856922) As long as the bill is not drafted, I cannot leave Champaran.

('15', 438, 7, 11, 857188) DEAR MR. MCPHERSON, I went over to Motihari yesterday and formally stopped the taking of statements.
('15', 438, 7, 12, 857289) I have told the raiyats that the Government are about to appoint a committee of inquiry which is likely to commence its work about the middle of July next and which will listen to their tale in so far as it may be necessary.
('15', 438, 7, 13, 857514) And I have told them that in view of the above mentioned decision of the Government, it is no longer necessary for me to take their statements.
('15', 438, 7, 14, 857658) I am shifting the headquarters to Motihari where my work and that of my colleagues will consist in studying and analysing the evidence we have already collected and in putting it in a presentable form.
('15', 438, 7, 15, 857860) The raiyats will still continue to come to us for information and guidance.
('15', 438, 7, 16, 857936) I do notice that to allow them to talk to us in any manner they choose is a great relief to them and they readily accept the advice that is given to them.
('15', 438, 7, 17, 858091) They are being told not to disturb the existing situation pending the inquiry except where it is manifestly illegal and in no case to take the law in their own hands.
('15', 438, 7, 18, 858258) I am not leaving for Ahmedabad till the resolution 1 appointing the committee is published and the hot controversy going on in the Press has subsided a little.
('15', 438, 7, 19, 858418) If you could please drop me a wire as to when the resolution is likely to be gazetted, I shall be obliged.

('15', 439, 8, 9, 858963) CONFIDENTIAL AND NOT FOR PUBLICATION MOTIHARI, June 17, 1917
('15', 439, 9, 10, 859024) As it will be remembered, prior to the publication of the Government Resolution 1 appointing the Committee of Inquiry, Mr. Gandhi was summoned to Ranchi, the Government intention then being to remove him and his co workers from Champaran.
('15', 439, 9, 11, 859263) There was an exhaustive discussion 2 of the whole situation between the Lieutenant Governor and Mr. Gandhi.
('15', 439, 9, 12, 859371) The latter saw also the other members of the Executive Council 3 and after two days discussion the Government desired to appoint a Committee and suggested that, in that event, Mr. Gandhi should stop taking statements.
('15', 439, 9, 13, 859589) He readily accepted the suggestion.
('15', 439, 9, 14, 859625) The Lieutenant Governor inquired if he would then withdraw his co workers and himself from Champaran.
('15', 439, 9, 15, 859727) Mr. Gandhi said he could not do so, and his colleagues and he would be occupied in marshalling the evidence and preparing for the Committee.
('15', 439, 9, 16, 859868) They could not do this well, out of Champaran.
('15', 439, 9, 17, 859915) Moreover, he could not let the raiyats think that he had, in any way, deserted them.
('15', 439, 9, 18, 860000) The Lieutenant Governor then did not press the point but hoped that, pending the meeting of the Committee, neither Mr. Gandhi nor his companions would go to the villages.
('15', 439, 9, 19, 860171) This, too, was agreed to.
('15', 439, 9, 20, 860197) The taking of statements and visits to the villages have now been entirely stopped.
('15', 439, 9, 21, 860281) The headquarters have been removed to

('15', 440, 1, 3, 860673) In all cases, they are being advised, pending the result of the inquiry, not to disturb the existing situation and it is Mr. Gandhis firm opinion that whilst the mission has undoubtedly strengthened the raiyats in their resolve to combat coercion and heartened them for a struggle to gain their freedom, its presence serves to restrain any excess on the part of the raiyats who without guidance might easily be betrayed into action which might harm them in the end.
('15', 440, 1, 4, 861139) The Committee meets about the 15th of July.
('15', 440, 1, 5, 861183) 1 During the interval, Mr. Gandhi is paying a flying visit to Ahmedabad, returning to Motihari at the latest on the 28th instant.
('15', 440, 1, 6, 861313) As to the constitution of the Committee, Mr. Gandhi has accepted his own appointment on the clear understanding that he should be free to give his own evidence and prepare and give the evidence of the raiyats and be as to this in the same position in which he would be if he was not a member of the Committee.
('15', 440, 1, 7, 861623) He has done so with the approval of the Honble Pandit Malaviyaji and Bihar friends, whom he met at Bankipore on his return from Ranchi.
('15', 440, 1, 8, 861759) The other nominations seem to have been made by the Government with much care and with a view to secure an equitable finding by the Committee.
('15', 440, 1, 9, 861902) There was throughout the discussion at Ranchi a deep desire on the part of the Lieutenant Governor to arrive at a fair settlement.
('15', 440, 1, 10, 862033) An unauthorised statement has been circulated by the Associated Press to the effect that Mr. Gandhi has advised private inquiry.
('15', 440, 1, 11, 862162) In substance the report is true.
('15', 440, 1, 12, 862195) Evidence collected is of an inflammatory nature and a heated newspaper discussion of the evidence is bound to create an atmosphere which will interfere with the conducting of a dispassionate inquiry.
('15', 440, 1, 13, 862395) The mission has no wish to unnecessarily injure the planters interest and so in their interest and to demonstrate that the mission desired nothing but justice for the raiyats, a private inquiry was suggested.
('15', 440, 1, 14, 862604) The raiyats could not be hurt by this procedure.
('15', 440, 1, 15, 862653) It is not to be inferred that the report was to be withheld from the public.
('15', 440, 1, 16, 862730) On the appearance, however, of the Asso ciated Press statement, Mr. Gandhi wired 2 to the Government saying that, as the suggestion was wholly in the planters interest, he withdrew

('15', 441, 1, 2, 863115) it and would welcome a public inquiry if the planters so desired.
('15', 441, 1, 3, 863181) It should be understood that whilst no more volunteers are required at present, no matter what the final result of the Government inquiry is, they will be required soon after the publication of the Governments decision on the Committees report.
('15', 441, 1, 4, 863426) Their work will be the most important and lasting and therefore it will be the final and essential stage of the mission.
('15', 441, 1, 5, 863547) Volunteers should, without any advertisement in the Press, be got ready and where they do not know Hindi but possess other qualifications, they should be advised to learn Hindi sufficient for the purpose.
('15', 441, 1, 6, 863752) They have to be grown up, reliable, hard working men who would not mind taking the spade and repairing or making village roads and cleaning village cesspools and who will in their dealings with the landlords guide the raiyats aright.
('15', 441, 1, 7, 863986) Six months of such training cannot fail to do incalculable good to the raiyats, the workers and the country at large.

('15', 441, 7, 13, 864270) I am going to Ahmedabad for 4 days.

('15', 442, 2, 3, 864690) [AHMEDABAD, June 23, 1917] 1
('15', 442, 3, 4, 864719) I take it that all of you have dedicated your lives to the school and I should like, therefore, to acquaint you with the present state of our finances.
('15', 442, 3, 5, 864871) We have Rs. 10,000 in cash in the Ashram Fund.
('15', 442, 3, 6, 864918) Besides this, I have jewellery and other gifts worth Rs. 20,000 given to me when I left for India.
('15', 442, 3, 7, 865017) A friend, again, has promised to buy and donate land and this should mean Rs. 10,000. We have thus a total of Rs. 40,000 or thereabouts.
('15', 442, 3, 8, 865154) It is my wish that the gifts l have received should not be put to sale in my life time, though of course they will be used in the service of the nation and we may dispose of them if we find that necessary.
('15', 442, 3, 9, 865360) This means that, even if we get no help just now and the position continues as at present, we have enough money to meet our needs for four years.
('15', 442, 3, 10, 865506) I am confident, though, that we shall get all the money we need.
('15', 442, 3, 11, 865571) It may happen, however, that we displease everyone as a result of our principles and that we get no money.
('15', 442, 3, 12, 865678) At such a time, the teachers will have two courses open to them.
('15', 442, 3, 13, 865743) One that they leave the school and take up some other work.
('15', 442, 3, 14, 865803) As for this, none of you is so entirely good for nothing that he cannot make a living somehow.
('15', 442, 3, 15, 865898) The other course is to continue to run the school, no matter what happens, maintaining yourselves, if need be, on no more than the plainest bread.
('15', 442, 3, 16, 866045) If it becomes necessary for you even to go begging for money, you should.
('15', 442, 3, 17, 866119) In other words, you should be ready to turn yourselves into beggars for the sake of the school.
('15', 442, 4, 18, 866215) OBJECTS OF SCHOOL l.
('15', 442, 4, 19, 866236) To adopt a new method of education.
('15', 442, 4, 20, 866272) 2. To pay special attention to character building, the aim being that ten per cent of the pupils at any rate get trained for national service.
('15', 442, 4, 21, 866415) 3. To raise the status of the Gujarati language.

('15', 443, 7, 12, 867531) I am of the view that they must live under the constant supervision of their mothers and nowhere else.
('15', 443, 7, 13, 867634) There should be holidays in summer and the school should be shifted to a cooler place.
('15', 443, 7, 14, 867721) This, I believe, will enable the teacher and the pupils to work very much better at other times.
('15', 443, 7, 15, 867818) The teachers and the pupils should spend the holidays together.
('15', 443, 7, 16, 867882) English should be an optional subject.
('15', 443, 7, 17, 867921) One should know good, at any rate correct, English.
('15', 443, 7, 18, 867973) It would be excellent if we could get an English teacher for the purpose, but I can think of no one at present except Miss Schlesin.
('15', 443, 7, 19, 868106) If only she would come, we could want nothing better.
('15', 443, 7, 20, 868160) She is a very capable person.
('15', 443, 7, 21, 868190) A pupil of the school should be able to talk in English with any Englishman without being nervous.
('15', 443, 7, 22, 868289) Drawing will be taught not as a fine art 2 but because the pupil should be able to draw for practical purposes, draw maps, for instance, and straight lines, have a good hand writing and should know memory drawing.

('15', 444, 1, 2, 868632) Rules should be framed for discipline 1in the school, but no compulsion should be used to enforce obedience to them; they [the pupil] should feel inclined to obey them on their own.
('15', 444, 1, 3, 868814) One should keep a watch on them whether they do.
('15', 444, 1, 4, 868863) If any of them does not, we should express our disapproval and advise him.
('15', 444, 1, 5, 868938) To start with, 100 pupils should be admitted to the school, all of whom can pay for their own expenses.
('15', 444, 1, 6, 869042) Nothing may be spent from the School Fund for any of the pupils.
('15', 444, 1, 7, 869107) If there is a good but poor student, we may secure help for him from one of our friends and beg of another for his fees; but the School Fund cannot be used for the purpose.
('15', 444, 1, 8, 869280) History, Geography, Science and Hygiene can be part of Gujarati.

('15', 444, 5, 14, 869681) I returned from Ahmedabad yesterday afternoon after an absence of eleven days.
('15', 444, 5, 15, 869760) My co workers have not made it a point of absenting themselves from Champaran but most of them have been absent off and on for their own businesses.
('15', 444, 5, 16, 869909) They have not been in evidence as their work has been confined to preparing for me a digest of the evidence collected by me and giving information to the inquirers.
('15', 444, 5, 17, 870074) There is I think complete absence of stir as the taking of evidence and visits to the dehats have been religiously avoided.

('15', 445, 3, 5, 870564) Dr. Deva of the Servants of India Society has been appointed by the Society to serve with me during the rest of my stay and work in Champaran.
('15', 445, 3, 6, 870707) Though his services are not required at the present moment, he has come to study my method of work so that his work may be the easier when the volunteers go out to the villages to render assistance.
('15', 445, 3, 7, 870906) Dr. Deva is naturally anxious to report himself to you and to wait on you whenever you can send an appointment for him.

('15', 446, 2, 3, 871926) MOTIHARI, June 30, 1917
('15', 446, 3, 4, 871950) SIR, I have hitherto successfully resisted the temptation of either answering your or Mr. Irwins criticism of the humble work I am doing in Champaran.
('15', 446, 3, 5, 872101) Nor am I going to succumb now except with regard to a matter which Mr. Irwin has thought fit to dwell upon and about which he has not even taken the trouble of being correctly informed.
('15', 446, 3, 6, 872287) I refer to his remarks on my manner of dressing.
('15', 446, 3, 7, 872336) My familiarity with the minor amenities of western civilization has taught me to respect my national costume, and it may interest Mr. Irwin to know that the dress I wear in Champaran is the dress I have always worn in India except that for a very short period in India I fell an easy prey in common with the rest of my countrymen to the wearing of semi European dress in the courts and elsewhere outside Kathiawar.
('15', 446, 3, 8, 872751) I appeared before the Kathiawar Courts now 21 years ago in precisely the dress I wear in Champaran.
('15', 446, 3, 9, 872851) One change I have made and it is that having taken to the occupation of weaving and agriculture and having taken the vow of swadeshi, my clothing is now entirely hand woven and hand sewn and made by me or my fellow workers.
('15', 446, 3, 10, 873075) Mr. Irwins letter suggests that I appear before the ryots in a dress I have temporarily and specially adopted in Champaran to produce an effect.
('15', 446, 3, 11, 873220) The fact is that I wear the national dress because it is the most natural and the most becoming for an Indian.
('15', 446, 3, 12, 873331) I believe that our copying of the European dress is a sign of our degradation, humiliation and our weakness; and that we are committing a national sin in discarding a dress which is best suited to the Indian climate and which, for its simplicity, art and cheapness, is not to be beaten on the face of the earth and which answers hygienic requirements.
('15', 446, 3, 13, 873683) Had it not been for a false pride and equally false notions of prestige, Englishmen here would long ago have adopted the Indian constume.
('15', 446, 3, 14, 873821) I may mention incidentally that I do not go about Champaran bare headed.
('15', 446, 3, 15, 873894) I do avoid shoes for sacred reasons, but I find too that it is more natural and healthier to avoid them whenever possible.
('15', 447, 0, 1, 874017) 448 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 447, 1, 2, 874059) I am sorry to inform Mr. Irwin and your readers that my esteemed friend Babu Brijkishore Prasad, the Ex hon.
('15', 447, 1, 3, 874168) member of council, still remains unregenerate and retains the provincial cap and never walks barefoot and kicks up a terrible noise even in the house we are living in by wearing wooden sandals.
('15', 447, 1, 4, 874362) He has still not the courage, in spite of most admirable contact with me, to discard his semi anglicised dress and whenever he goes to see officials puts his legs into the bifurcated garment and on his own admission tortures himself by cramping his feet in inelastic shoes.
('15', 447, 1, 5, 874636) I cannot induce him to believe that his clients wont desert him and the courts wont punish him if he wore his more becoming and less expensive dhoti.
('15', 447, 1, 6, 874786) I invite you and Mr. Irwin not to believe the stories that the latter hears about me and my friends, but to join me in the crusade against educated Indians abandoning their manners, habits and customs which are not proved to be bad or harmful.
('15', 447, 1, 7, 875030) Finally, I venture to warn you and Mr. Irwin that you and he will ill serve the cause both of you consider is in danger by reason of my presence in Champaran if you continue, as you have done, to base your strictures on unproved facts.
('15', 447, 1, 8, 875266) I ask you to accept my assurance that I should deem myself unworthy of the friendship and confidence of hundreds of my English friends and associatesnot all of them fellow cranksif in similar circumstances I acted towards them differently from my own countrymen.

('15', 447, 6, 13, 875618) MY DEAR ESTHER, I have your two letters before me.
('15', 447, 6, 14, 875669) I returned from Ahmedabad on the 28th.
('15', 447, 6, 15, 875708) I had a nice time there.
('15', 447, 6, 16, 875733) The city life I have always found, to be chilling; the village life, free, invigorating and godly.
('15', 447, 6, 17, 875832) Why has God given us so many gifts, powers, skill to invent if we are not to use them? You have asked a question which I have asked myself and thousands are always asking.
('15', 447, 6, 18, 876004) My humble opinion is
('15', 448, 0, 1, 876025) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 449
('15', 448, 1, 2, 876067) that God has placed temptations in our way the strength of which is the same as that of the possibilities of rise in moral grandeur.
('15', 448, 1, 3, 876200) We may use our inventive faculty either for inward growth or for outward indulgence.
('15', 448, 1, 4, 876285) I may devote my talents for utilizing the falls from the Himalayas; I only increase mankinds facilities for indulgence.
('15', 448, 1, 5, 876405) I may use my talents for discovering laws which govern the falls from the Himalayas within me; I serve myself and mankind by adding to the permanent happiness.
('15', 448, 1, 6, 876565) You will make up for yourself countless illustrations showing that all our talents are to be utilized only for inward growth which can come from self restraint alone.
('15', 448, 1, 7, 876732) Do please remember me to Mr. Bittmann 1 and thank him on my behalf for permitting you to come to the Ashram whenever you are free.
('15', 448, 1, 8, 876863) Your experience of the young man is nothing extraordinary.
('15', 448, 1, 9, 876922) Pray do not be impatient to reform men and women whom you meet.
('15', 448, 1, 10, 876986) The first and the last thing we have to attend to is to reform ourselves.
('15', 448, 1, 11, 877060) In trying to reform, we seem to be judging.
('15', 448, 1, 12, 877104) These young men often become worse for our handling.
('15', 448, 1, 13, 877157) The safest course is to let such men leave us when they are found wanting.
('15', 448, 1, 14, 877232) I have not sufficiently expressed myself.
('15', 448, 1, 15, 877274) But you will understand.

('15', 450, 1, 3, 879640) This propaganda must be carried on in spite of Government prohibition and to that extent it may be considered illegal but for a passive resister not unlawful.
('15', 450, 1, 4, 879799) There are various other methods which I am unwilling to advise until passive resistance in its present form has soaked into us a bit.
('15', 450, 1, 5, 879933) This, however, I should like to add that in this method there is no idea of punishment of the wrong doer.
('15', 450, 1, 6, 880039) There can, therefore, be no retaliation and no boycott.
('15', 450, 1, 7, 880095) But there should be swadeshi of the purest type, not as a retaliatory measure but as the law of our being.

('15', 451, 3, 4, 881534) DEAR FRIEND, All these days the expenses on the Satyagraha Ashram and its various activities could be met entirely from help voluntarily given by some friends; but these activities have now expanded so much that it does not seem possible to meet the expenses without asking for help.
('15', 451, 3, 5, 881818) The activities of the Ashram can be divided under the following heads: (1) Boarding and lodging expenses of the Ashram inmates: The present strength of the Ashram, including adults and children, may be put down at 30. The expenses on their account, including rent, amount to Rs. 400/ a month.
('15', 451, 3, 6, 882111) This figure includes expenditure on guests.
('15', 451, 3, 7, 882155) (2) Hand weaving: No one in the Ashram knew this two years ago.
('15', 451, 3, 8, 882219) Today practically everyone knows something of it.
('15', 451, 3, 9, 882269) Some of them may actually be regarded as experts.
('15', 451, 3, 10, 882319) There are seven looms working in the Ashram and five more under its supervision.
('15', 451, 3, 11, 882400) This activity has taken up a capital of Rs. 3,000/ .
('15', 451, 3, 12, 882453) Cloth gets sold as soon as it is produced.
('15', 451, 3, 13, 882496) Cloth worth Rs. 500/ has been sold up to this time.
('15', 451, 3, 14, 882548) This work has enabled four families which had given up weaving to resume it and in all 17 persons make their living by it.
('15', 451, 3, 15, 882671) One family has learnt weaving recently and taken to it for a living.
('15', 451, 3, 16, 882740) It cannot be said yet that it makes enough for a livelihood.
('15', 451, 3, 17, 882801) The expectation is that in ten years thousands of weavers who have given up weaving as a profession will have resumed it.
('15', 451, 3, 18, 882923) It is admitted on all hands that, even if the textile mills stay, there is sufficient scope in the country for hand weaving.
('15', 451, 3, 19, 883048) This activity involves some loss at present but ultimately there should benone.
('15', 451, 3, 20, 883128) The current expenditure may be put down at Rs. 100/ a month.
('15', 451, 4, 21, 883189) 1 Vide Letter to Fulchand Shah, 3 7 1917, which says: I sent one copy to Ambalalbhai yesterday. The printed copy, however, bears the date Ashadh Vad 9, Samvat 1973, corresponding to July 13, 1917.
('15', 452, 0, 1, 883386) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 453
('15', 452, 1, 2, 883428) [(3)] The third activity is the National School.
('15', 452, 1, 3, 883477) We in the Ashram believe that the great harm that is being done to the country will continue so long as education is not given along national lines.
('15', 452, 1, 4, 883626) Accordingly, a National School has been started as an experiment.
('15', 452, 1, 5, 883692) The aim is to give higher education through the mother tongue and in a manner that will impose no strain.
('15', 452, 1, 6, 883798) If the experiment succeeds, the intention is to ask the Government itself to provide such education, and to carry on ceaseless agitation for the purpose.
('15', 452, 1, 7, 883952) Likewise, if the success of the experiment can be demonstrated, it is likely that private enterprise may start other experiments of a similar nature.
('15', 452, 1, 8, 884102) In this experiment, both mental and physical education is provided.
('15', 452, 1, 9, 884170) A curriculum extending over 13 years is visualized.
('15', 452, 1, 10, 884222) This will include, besides training corresponding to a graduates, instruction in the Hindi language, in agriculture and weaving.
('15', 452, 1, 11, 884351) The responsibility for conducting this experiment has been undertaken by Professor Sankalchand Shah, formerly Professor of Science at Gujarat College.
('15', 452, 1, 12, 884502) He has worked for ten years with Professor Gajjar 1. His assistants are Shri Narahari Parikh, LL.B., Shri Dattatreya Kalelkar, B.A., Shri Fulchand Shah, B.A., Shri Kishorelal Mashruwala 2, B.A.,LL.B., and my nephew, Chhaganlal Gandhi.
('15', 452, 1, 13, 884737) We are looking for one or two more teachers, who should be men of character.
('15', 452, 1, 14, 884814) In the study of Sanskrit, Shastri Girijashankar of Ahmedabad has been giving help.
('15', 452, 1, 15, 884897) Professor Anandshankar Dhruva supervises the experiment and makes suggestions.
('15', 452, 1, 16, 884976) Help is also sought from other men of learning.
('15', 452, 1, 17, 885024) The teachers draw maintenance allowance according to their needs.
('15', 452, 1, 18, 885090) The experiment costs at present Rs 500/ a month.
('15', 452, 1, 19, 885139) This does not include rent since it has been included in the expenditure for the Ashram.
('15', 452, 1, 20, 885228) The number of students at present is 12. The experiment has reached such a stage that it is proposed to admit day students now.
('15', 452, 1, 21, 885356) So far, the students were either boys from the Ashram or sons of the teachers.
('15', 452, 1, 22, 885435) [(4)] The fourth activity is propagation of the Hindi language.
('15', 452, 1, 23, 885499) There is no room for any difference of opinion about Hindi being

('15', 453, 1, 2, 885857) entitled to the place which is at present usurped by English, but, to our misfortune, such a difference does exist.
('15', 453, 1, 3, 885973) The educated class must have a common language and that can only be Hindi.
('15', 453, 1, 4, 886048) It will be easy to work among the masses through it.
('15', 453, 1, 5, 886101) And therefore the delay in Hindi gaining its rightful place means so much of harm to the nation.
('15', 453, 1, 6, 886198) Efforts are being made in the country to stop this harm.
('15', 453, 1, 7, 886255) The work by the Ashram will add one more to these efforts.
('15', 453, 1, 8, 886314) The first step in this work consists mainly in securing Hindi teachers and training them.
('15', 453, 1, 9, 886404) I estimate the monthly expenditure on this work at not less than Rs. 200/ .
('15', 453, 1, 10, 886480) [(5)] The fifth category consists of my political activities, on such matters only in which I can see my way.
('15', 453, 1, 11, 886590) The only expenditure in this is on railway fare for me and my co workers.
('15', 453, 1, 12, 886664) It hardly comes to Rs. l00/ a month.
('15', 453, 1, 13, 886701) So far, I have had to make no effort to find it.
('15', 453, 1, 14, 886750) All the same, I include it here.
('15', 453, 1, 15, 886783) Thus, the total monthly expenditure comes to: Rs. For running Ashram 400 Weaving 100 School 500 Propagation of Hindi 200 My railway fare 100 1,300 approximately.
('15', 453, 1, 16, 886945) The expenditure on the National School will increase by and by, so that it will not be an over estimate to put the total expenditure at Rs. 1,500/ .
('15', 453, 1, 17, 887094) A large plot of land is required for all these activities.
('15', 453, 1, 18, 887153) Such a plot, admeasuring about 55 bighas, has already been purchased on the banks of the Sabarmati near the Sabarmati jail.
('15', 453, 1, 19, 887277) Efforts are proceeding to buy some more.
('15', 453, 1, 20, 887318) A workshop for weaving, living rooms, kitchens for the Ashram and a building for the National School are to be constructed on this land.
('15', 453, 1, 21, 887455) This is likely to cost Rs. 100,000. The responsibility for supervising the building construction has been taken over by Shri Amritlal Thakkar of the Hind Sevak Samaj 1.
('15', 453, 2, 22, 887624) My needs, therefore, adding a years expenses to the cost of the buildings, come to Rs. 118,000. For the land, I have drawn upon

('15', 454, 1, 3, 887841) There will be a trust for this land and the buildings.
('15', 454, 2, 4, 887896) If these ventures meet with your approval, I have no option but to hold out my hand to you and you have none but to give, to the best of your means, and induce others to give to the best of theirs.
('15', 454, 2, 5, 888094) If you desire to help only in regard to a particular item in the programme, your contribution will be spent accordingly.
('15', 454, 2, 6, 888215) Even if, however, you see nothing but eccentricity in all my activities, it is my request that all those who know me should help me that I may satisfy my own self.
('15', 454, 2, 7, 888379) So long as I do not myself see my error, these activities will remain my very life.
('15', 454, 2, 8, 888463) They sum up my services to the country.
('15', 454, 2, 9, 888503) I wanted to go myself and see you personally but I see no possibility of my being free to leave Champaran for about nine months.
('15', 454, 2, 10, 888632) The activities will continue meanwhile and so also the expenses.
('15', 454, 3, 11, 888697) I dont want at present to go a begging through newspapers.
('15', 454, 3, 12, 888756) Before doing so, it is necessary to make some progress with the work and gather more experience.
('15', 454, 3, 13, 888853) Kindly send what help you can directly to Satyagraha Ashram, Ahmedabad; alternatively, you may send it to me at the Motihari address.
('15', 454, 3, 14, 888987) I also request you to obtain some help from your friends, if you possibly can.
('15', 454, 3, 15, 889066) If you are not in a position yourself to offer monetary help, I would like you to solicit such help from friends who can.
('15', 454, 3, 16, 889188) I do not want anyone to move outside his own circle for the purpose.
('15', 454, 4, 17, 889257) Careful accounts are maintained for all categories of activities.
('15', 454, 4, 18, 889323) It is intended to circulate an abstract of the accounts among friends every year.
('15', 454, 5, 19, 889405) You may ask me any questions you like to.

('15', 455, 3, 4, 889720) MAGANLAL, I have written 2 to Mr. Ewbank 3 and told him that my ignorance of the subject is profound.
('15', 455, 3, 5, 889822) I shall be busy in Champaran for some months.
('15', 455, 3, 6, 889868) If, all the same, he wants me to speak, in the hope that I shall have the time, and if he sends me literature on the subject, I shall try to write out something 4. Never mind if you have kept on the house maid for some time longer.
('15', 455, 3, 7, 890100) I had a letter from Fakira.
('15', 455, 3, 8, 890128) In reply 5, I have asked him to go there.
('15', 455, 3, 9, 890170) You and Chhotalal must get rid of cooking and miscellaneous chores.
('15', 455, 3, 10, 890238) Unless that is done, I am, afraid, we shall make no progress in weaving.
('15', 455, 3, 11, 890311) How this can be brought about, it is for you to consider.
('15', 455, 3, 12, 890369) Set Satyadevji 6 to the quern.
('15', 455, 3, 13, 890400) It doesnt matter if he has been supplied chillies.
('15', 455, 3, 14, 890451) That is a yajna 7 for us on his account.
('15', 455, 3, 15, 890492) Let us see if it is rewarded.
('15', 455, 3, 16, 890522) I wonder.
('15', 455, 3, 17, 890532) One neednt worry if he takes chillies only for the sake of health.
('15', 455, 3, 18, 890599) A yajna must be performed cheerfully.
('15', 455, 3, 19, 890637) We have done what we have done because we think it right and so must we do everything and supply him [the chillies] with love and in cheerfulness.
('15', 455, 3, 20, 890784) I am sending the enclosed cutting to be preserved.

('15', 458, 1, 2, 895006) expenses were met from support given by friends without the necessity of a formal appeal being made to them.
('15', 458, 1, 3, 895115) The expenses including those of a considerable number of temporary visitors have amounted to Rs. 400/ per month on an average.
('15', 458, 1, 4, 895242) But its activity has gradually widened and includes (i) weaving by means of handlooms, (ii) an experiment in evolving a national type of education, (iii) spread of Hindi as a common medium for educated India.
('15', 458, 1, 5, 895451) These activities mean much greater expenditure of money than has come to me as above stated.
('15', 458, 1, 6, 895544) For developing them a permanent habitation on a fairly large plot of land is a necessity.
('15', 458, 1, 7, 895634) Out of funds already in my possession over fifty bighas of land has been purchased on the banks of the Sabarmati on a healthy site some distance from the central gaol.
('15', 458, 1, 8, 895802) It affords an easy access to the College students who have in ever increasing numbers been making use of the Ashram Library which contains a fair volume of selected literature and newspapers and magazines, the latter being kindly supplied free of charge by the respective publishers.
('15', 458, 1, 9, 896086) According to a rough estimate made by Mr. Amritlal Thakkar of the Servants of India Society, who is drawing up the plans, the cost of the buildings will be Rs. 100,000. The educational experiment is costing Rs. 500/ per month.
('15', 458, 1, 10, 896313) The handloom industry Rs. 100/ per month.
('15', 458, 1, 11, 896355) The Hindi propaganda for the ensuing year will cost Rs. 200/ per month.
('15', 458, 1, 12, 896427) The educational and Hindi expenditure are a progressive charge.
('15', 458, 1, 13, 896491) To these may be added my own travelling expenses Rs. 100/ per month in connection with one public activity or other.
('15', 458, 1, 14, 896608) These last are easily met.
('15', 458, 1, 15, 896635) Thus the whole figure comes to capital expenditure of Rs. 100,000 and Rs. 1,300, say Rs. 1500, allowing extra Rs. 200/ per month for progressive expenditure, making rupees 18,000/ for the next twelve months.
('15', 458, 1, 16, 896843) I shall attempt only the briefest description of the activities mentioned above.
('15', 458, 1, 17, 896924) The handloom weaving is in a dying condition.
('15', 458, 1, 18, 896970) Everyone admits that whatever may be the future of the mill industry, the handlooms ought not to be allowed to perish.
('15', 458, 1, 19, 897089) Dr. Mann 1 in his recent pamphlet says that probably one of the causes of the growing poverty observed by him in particular villages was the destruction of handlooms which complemented agricultural occupation.
('15', 458, 1, 20, 897299) The object of the Ashram, therefore, is for every inmate to learn hand weaving

('15', 459, 1, 2, 897499) and thus study at first hand the secrets and defects of the art and then find out the means of saving the industry.
('15', 459, 1, 3, 897615) Every inmate, though none belongs to the weaving class, now knows something of the art.
('15', 459, 1, 4, 897703) And a few have attained considerable skill in the art.
('15', 459, 1, 5, 897758) The Ashram is already supporting weaving families numbering 17 souls and one family having learnt the art at the Ashram has set up inde pendently and is trying to support itself from the business.
('15', 459, 1, 6, 897955) Seven looms are working at the Ashram.
('15', 459, 1, 7, 897994) It has involved a capital expenditure of Rs. 3,000/ .
('15', 459, 1, 8, 898048) It ought soon to be self supporting.
('15', 459, 1, 9, 898085) Ne arly Rs. 500 worth of stuff has already been sold by the Ashram and many who have hitherto used the shoddy mill made stuff, whether foreign or home made, are using the durable Ashram made cloth.
('15', 459, 1, 10, 898283) This enterprise is expected in 10 years time to resuscitate hundreds of weavers who have for the moment abandoned their trade in hopeless despair.
('15', 459, 1, 11, 898430) The system of education at present in vogue is, it is held, wholly unsuited to Indias needs, is a bad copy of the western model and it has by reason of the medium of in struction being a foreign language sapped the energy of the youths who have passed through our schools and colleges and has prduced an army of clerks and office seekers.
('15', 459, 1, 12, 898769) It has dried up all originality, impoverished the vernaculars and has deprived the masses of the benefit of higher knowledge which would otherwise have percolated to them through the intercourse of the educated classes with them.
('15', 459, 1, 13, 898999) The system has resulted in creating a gulf between educated India and the masses.
('15', 459, 1, 14, 899081) It has stimulated the brain but starved the spirit for want of a religious basis for education and emaciated the body for want of training of handicrafts.
('15', 459, 1, 15, 899236) It has criminally neglected the greatest need of India in that there is no agricultural training worth the name provided in the course.
('15', 459, 1, 16, 899372) The experiment now being carried on at the Ashram seeks to avoid all t he defects above noted.
('15', 459, 1, 17, 899467) The medium of instruction is the provincial vernacular.
('15', 459, 1, 18, 899523) Hindi is taught as a common medium and handloom weaving and agriculture are taught from he very commencement.
('15', 459, 1, 19, 899633) Pupils are taught to look up to these as a means of livelihood and the knowledge of letters as a training for the head and the heart and as a means of national service.
('15', 459, 1, 20, 899802) The curriculum has been mapped so as to cover all the essentials of the graduate course in the existing institutions within a period of 13 years.
('15', 459, 1, 21, 899948) The experiment is in the hands of Professor Shah, late of the Gujarat College.
('15', 459, 1, 22, 900027) Mr. Shah was associated with Professor Gajjar for 10 years.
('15', 459, 1, 23, 900087) He is assisted by Mr. Narhari, B.A., LL.B., Mr. Fulchand Shah, B.A., Mr. Dattatreya Kalelkar, B.A., Mr. Chhaganlal Gandhi and Mr. Kishorelal Mashruwala, B.A., LL.B. All but the last named have pledged themselves exclusively to he work for life on a pittance enough to support them and their families.
('15', 459, 1, 24, 900388) Mr. Kishorelal has given

('15', 460, 1, 2, 900455) his services free for one year, having means of his own, and will if he finds the work congenial at the end of the year cast in his lot with the rest.
('15', 460, 1, 3, 900606) The experiment is confined to about 12 lads including two girls belonging to the Ashram or being children of the teachers.
('15', 460, 1, 4, 900729) It is being supervised by Professor Anandshankar Dhruva, Vice Principal of the Gujarat College.
('15', 460, 1, 5, 900825) I build the highest hopes upon it.
('15', 460, 1, 6, 900860) My faith in it is unquenchable.
('15', 460, 1, 7, 900892) It may fail but if it does, the fault must not be in the system but with us the workers.
('15', 460, 1, 8, 900981) If it succeeds, voluntary institutions after its model can be multiplied and the Government called upon to adopt it.
('15', 460, 1, 9, 901098) That Hindi ought at the earliest moment to displace English seems to be a self demonstrated proposition.
('15', 460, 1, 10, 901203) Hindi can not only become the common medium between the educated classes but it opens the door to the hearts of the masses in a way which no other vernacular does and English certainly never can.
('15', 460, 1, 11, 901399) Madras alone presents a difficulty but I have sufficient faith in the spirituality and the imaginative faculty of the southerners to know that they will not be long before they take up Hindi as the common medium.
('15', 460, 1, 12, 901612) No presidency in India has the same aptitude for learning languages that Madras has.
('15', 460, 1, 13, 901697) That is my South African experience.
('15', 460, 1, 14, 901734) Although the preponderating element there is Dravidian, the Tamils and the Telugus picked up Hindi instead of the Hindustani speaking races picking up Tamil or Telugu.
('15', 460, 1, 15, 901902) It is then for these experiments that I ask for your pecuniary support.
('15', 460, 1, 16, 901974) I hope you will send me what you can, if you at all agree with any of the activities.
('15', 460, 1, 17, 902060) You may earmark your donation if you wish.
('15', 460, 1, 18, 902103) A trust will be created of the land and buildings.
('15', 460, 1, 19, 902154) Accurate account of the expenditure in the various branches is being kept and an abstract will be rendered to the donors.
('15', 460, 1, 20, 902276) I do not want if I can help it as yet to make an appeal through the Press.
('15', 460, 1, 21, 902351) The activities have not advanced far enough to warrant such an appeal.
('15', 460, 1, 22, 902422) But I do not hesitate to approach with confidence those who know me personally either to assist me themselves or advise their friends to do so.

('15', 461, 2, 3, 902807) BANKIPORE, July 7, 1917
('15', 461, 3, 4, 902831) DEAR MR. MAFFEY, I am on my way to Ranchi in connection with the work of the Champaran committee.
('15', 461, 3, 5, 902929) I write this regarding the Annie Besant agitation.
('15', 461, 3, 6, 902980) As I am taking part in it by keeping myself in touch with the leaders and pressing on their attention my views regarding it, 1 I feel that I could not do so without His Excellency knowing the fact and knowing also my position in the agitation.
('15', 461, 3, 7, 903224) In my humble opinion, the internments are a big blunder.
('15', 461, 3, 8, 903281) Madras was absolutely calm before then.
('15', 461, 3, 9, 903321) Now it is badly disturbed.
('15', 461, 3, 10, 903348) India as a whole had not made common cause with Mrs. Besant but now she is on a fair way towards commanding Indias identity with her methods.
('15', 461, 3, 11, 903490) Having had breathing time, I had gone down to Ahmedabad for some work connected with the institution I am conducting there, I passed through Bombay and Allahabad on my return and I was able to gauge the situation.
('15', 461, 3, 12, 903704) I myself do not like much in Mrs. Besants method.
('15', 461, 3, 13, 903754) I have not liked the idea of the political propaganda being carried on during the War.
('15', 461, 3, 14, 903841) In my opinion, our restraint will have been the best propaganda.
('15', 461, 3, 15, 903906) But the whole country was against me.
('15', 461, 3, 16, 903944) And no one could deny Mrs. Besants great sacrifice and love for India or her desire to be strictly constitutional, nor could the countrys right to carry on the propaganda be denied if it chose to do so.
('15', 461, 3, 17, 904147) Many of us have respectfully differed from Mrs. Besant but all have recognised her powers and devotion.
('15', 461, 3, 18, 904251) The Congress was trying to capture Mrs. Besant.
('15', 461, 3, 19, 904299) The latter was trying to capture the former.
('15', 461, 3, 20, 904344) Now they have almost become one.
('15', 461, 3, 21, 904377) I plead with all the earnestness I can command for the boldest policy, i.e., to acknowledge the blunder in the frankest manner and to withdraw the orders of internment and to declare that the country has the right to carry on any propaganda that is not subversive of the British Constitution and is totally free from violence.
('15', 461, 3, 22, 904704) Such an act will be a demonstration of strength, not of weakness.
('15', 461, 3, 23, 904770) Only a government having the desire always to do the right and the power to crush the wrong can do it.

('15', 462, 1, 2, 904956) If unfortunately timid counsels prevail, there will be no rest in the country and the cult of violence will surely spread.
('15', 462, 1, 3, 905079) Open violence one could understand and deal with.
('15', 462, 1, 4, 905129) That may not be practised, but secret violence would be attempted.
('15', 462, 1, 5, 905196) No one would be or feel responsible for it.
('15', 462, 1, 6, 905240) Young minds without any lead from anybody in particular are, I regretfully observe, drifting in that direction.
('15', 462, 1, 7, 905352) My life is dedicated to the preventing of the spread of the disease and its uprooting in so far as it has gained a foothold.
('15', 462, 1, 8, 905477) I have presented to the youths and to Indians in general in my humble way a better and more effective method and that is the method of soul force or truth force or love force which for want of a better term I have described as passive resistance.
('15', 462, 1, 9, 905724) And I am asking the leaders to adopt this method fully and boldly at this critical juncture.
('15', 462, 1, 10, 905817) It involves self suffering and that alone throughout.
('15', 462, 1, 11, 905871) No government in the world can afford continually to imprison or molest innocent men; the British Government cannot afford it.
('15', 462, 1, 12, 905998) It is its great secret and character that even when it does wrong, it seeks to justify it before the world on moral grounds.I think I have sufficiently explained myself.
('15', 462, 1, 13, 906168) I hope, I shall not be misunderstood.
('15', 462, 1, 14, 906206) I ask for forgiveness for the presumption in writing this letter and earnestly pray for the acceptance of my proposal.
('15', 462, 2, 15, 906325) Please place this before His Excellency.
('15', 462, 2, 16, 906366) If my presence is required at Simla, I am at H.E.s disposal.

('15', 463, 5, 9, 906954) I know you will like it.
('15', 463, 5, 10, 906979) The letter has created quite a stir here.
('15', 463, 5, 11, 907021) It has been favourably received so far.

('15', 463, 13, 22, 907463) You ought not to be ill.
('15', 463, 13, 23, 907488) There is much work to be done for the country, and what will happen if the countrys soldiers become ill?
('15', 463, 13, 24, 907593) Keeping this in mind, I hope, you will try to rid yourself of the ailment.
('15', 463, 13, 25, 907668) Physicians will not be able to remove t he ailment.
('15', 463, 13, 26, 907720) The cause of the illness is self indulgence, its cure restraint.

('15', 465, 3, 12, 910793) I will then go to Motihari.
('15', 465, 3, 13, 910821) Your letters should continue to be directed there.
('15', 465, 3, 14, 910872) There is a possibility that I may have to go to Bombay before the 29th in connection with [the internment of] Annie Bai 2. Do tell me every time how Muljibhai keeps.
('15', 465, 3, 15, 911038) Punjabhai was to leave for Marwar.
('15', 465, 3, 16, 911073) Has he left?
('15', 465, 3, 17, 911086) Have the books expected from Bombay arrived?

('15', 465, 4, 19, 911190) Maganlal knows about this.
('15', 465, 4, 20, 911217) Are the Ashram inmates able to utilize the presence of Swamiji for learning Hindi?
('15', 465, 4, 21, 911300) I suppose the women are not able to do so.

('15', 465, 7, 26, 911430) I see that this is a laborious job.
('15', 465, 7, 27, 911466) You should inform me only when there is some notable item of expenditure or income.
('15', 465, 7, 28, 911550) Otherwise dont worry.

('15', 466, 1, 2, 912002) 381. A FEW WORDS TO ORPHANAGES 1
('15', 466, 2, 3, 912035) [Before July 11, 1917]
('15', 466, 3, 4, 912058) In the course of my travels in India, I have examined a number of orphanages, some of them closely and others cursorily, and have expressed my views on some of them before the managers.
('15', 466, 3, 5, 912244) Like anyone else, I also think well of my ideas and I feel that it will not be amiss to place them before the public.
('15', 466, 3, 6, 912362) An anathashrama may be correctly defined as a place which gives shelter to those who are anatha 2 and makes them sanatha 3. In respect of such institutions, the term anatha is especially applied to children who have no living parents or guardians.
('15', 466, 3, 7, 912610) Their claim is, or ought to be, to make good the want of a guardian.
('15', 466, 3, 8, 912679) Anathashram is a translation of the English term orphanage.
('15', 466, 3, 9, 912739) Though this is the meaning of the term anatha, besides children, young men who can earn their livelihood are also accommodated in orphanages.
('15', 466, 3, 10, 912881) In addition, the disabled, the lame, the crippled and the blind are also admitted and now even foundling boxes have been introduced in orphanages.
('15', 466, 3, 11, 913028) It is my opinion that this way one of the purposes is served fully.
('15', 466, 3, 12, 913096) Though, superficially considered, it might suggest a more philanthropic attitude, on deeper reflection it will be seen that this state of affairs comes of a commercial mentality.
('15', 466, 3, 13, 913275) I have no doubt that the future of the orphanages is the same as that of misers who would earn the highest interest on their moneys and so ultimately ruin themselves.
('15', 466, 3, 14, 913442) I have used the word future only to be on the safe side.
('15', 466, 3, 15, 913499) Personally, I see their degradation in the present.
('15', 466, 3, 16, 913551) An arrangement like this is a sign of our fear, of our lack of faith.
('15', 466, 3, 17, 913621) We assume that, for all our institutions, we get help from the rich only with the utmost efforts.
('15', 466, 3, 18, 913719) We cannot but protect the disabled and we are bound to take care of babies born in secret; so let us manage that from whatever we have received. This is an abject attitude.
('15', 466, 3, 19, 913892) I am convinced that for a good cause money will be available even in this poor country of India.
('15', 466, 3, 20, 913989) It is for those in charge to prove that the cause is good.
('15', 466, 3, 21, 914048) Institutions have

('15', 467, 1, 3, 914410) Whether or no this view is right, one thing is certain, that, in trying to ride three horses at once the orphanages succeed in managing none.
('15', 467, 1, 4, 914552) In these conditions, how can the orphans cease to be orphans?
('15', 467, 1, 5, 914614) They are constantly reminded of the fact of their being such.
('15', 467, 1, 6, 914676) We would never want to leave our children in charge of these institutions.
('15', 467, 1, 7, 914751) Here is the real test of an orphanage.
('15', 467, 1, 8, 914790) We would not welcome the companionship of the disabled, the blind, or the crippled for our children.
('15', 467, 1, 9, 914891) If these institutions were [really] the guardians of those without any guardians, we would find the managers children among the inmates.
('15', 467, 1, 10, 915028) They would have no hesitation in placing their children in the midst of the orphans, if for no other reason, at least in order to test themselves.
('15', 467, 1, 11, 915175) I submit, on the strength of my extensive experience, that this is not too excessive an expectation.
('15', 467, 1, 12, 915276) That the orphans are placed with the disabled is not all; the other arrangements also are mostly such that the children are constantly reminded of their destitute condition.
('15', 467, 1, 13, 915450) If orphanages were reserved for orphans alone, they could be self supporting in a very short time.
('15', 467, 1, 14, 915549) We have much to learn from the Salvation Army 1 in this respect.
('15', 467, 1, 15, 915614) The orphanages which they run have a soul in them.
('15', 467, 1, 16, 915665) Ours are by comparison soulless.
('15', 467, 1, 17, 915698) They have given refuge to thousands of children, have made men of them, have found employment for them.
('15', 467, 1, 18, 915802) The children in our orphanages have not been given this sense of security.
('15', 467, 1, 19, 915877) Some have been found petty jobs.
('15', 467, 1, 20, 915910) These may be left out of account.
('15', 467, 1, 21, 915944) The general practice in our orphanages is to send away the children when they come of age.
('15', 467, 1, 22, 916035) Not so with the Salvation Army.
('15', 467, 1, 23, 916067) In its institutions the orphans, when they come of age, start working in its factories, in the same way that a son in the family who has grown up is regarded as an additional shield and support for the family.
('15', 467, 1, 24, 916277) It is necessary that such a family feeling be injected in our institutions too.
('15', 467, 1, 25, 916357) We can educate them in the institutions and find work for them in the factories of the institutions even as we provide them with lodging, boarding and clothing.
('15', 467, 1, 26, 916518) We can launch great national experiments in the institutions, can impart education on national lines, teach them crafts, teach them agriculture, and save the professions which are dying out.
('15', 467, 1, 27, 916709) If affairs are managed in this manner, the

('15', 468, 1, 2, 916877) orphans of today can become teachers, artisans, and leaders in their own orphanages.
('15', 468, 1, 3, 916962) We can also raise an Indian Defence Force suited to our conditions from among the inmates of such orphanages.
('15', 468, 1, 4, 917072) If I am right in these calculations, a common standard can be set up for all the institutions by bringing together the heads of all the institutions, or at least of those in the Bombay Province, and consulting their views.
('15', 468, 1, 5, 917295) If there is a central executive body for all, it can supervise them and make such changes as are called for by experience.
('15', 468, 1, 6, 917418) If we are not ready for such an integrated scheme, a policy like the one indicated above can surely be introduced in those institutions which have more of life in them.
('15', 468, 2, 7, 917587) In some institutions, I noted a tendency to coax children into staying on there.
('15', 468, 2, 8, 917668) To me this seems to be an ill considered thing to do.
('15', 468, 2, 9, 917722) The boys who do not want to continue in the orphanages are not orphans but free persons [who can look after themselves].
('15', 468, 2, 10, 917843) The worth of an orphanage should not be judged by the number of inmates, but rather by the number of citizens it turns out.
('15', 468, 3, 11, 917967) There are enough institutions to meet the needs of the disabled.
('15', 468, 3, 12, 918032) That, wherever necessary, such institutions should be set up separately, requires no elaborate proof.
('15', 468, 3, 13, 918134) The problem of admitting foundlings is a serious one.
('15', 468, 3, 14, 918188) I am not yet convinced that providing for such admissions is ethically sound.
('15', 468, 3, 15, 918266) I have a kind of feeling that such facilities lead to increase in indulgence.
('15', 468, 3, 16, 918344) It can in no way be proved that keeping alive every creature that is born, no matter how, is a part of humanitarianism.
('15', 468, 3, 17, 918464) It is indeed futile to make such an effort.
('15', 468, 3, 18, 918508) One detects a hidden pride behind it.
('15', 468, 3, 19, 918546) I, for one, realize every moment from experience that the term humanitarianism is not easy to understand.
('15', 468, 3, 20, 918652) I have in some measure made that subject my own and hence I have ventured to be so emphatic.
('15', 468, 3, 21, 918745) Humanitarianism does not mean saving a definite number of lives.
('15', 468, 3, 22, 918810) It is the very property of the soul.
('15', 468, 3, 23, 918847) Because of this fact, living creatures in the presence of a compassionate soul have an immediate and direct experience of its compassion.
('15', 468, 3, 24, 918985) There is no room for arithmetic in humanitarianism.
('15', 468, 3, 25, 919037) Unclean flour is infested with numberless lives.
('15', 468, 3, 26, 919086) To preserve such flour is no humanitarianism.
('15', 468, 3, 27, 919132) It lies rather in covering up the flour with earth or destroying it, though either way the vermin in the flour perish.
('15', 468, 3, 28, 919251) Numberless vermin perish even in the process of keeping our bodies clean.
('15', 468, 3, 29, 919325) Pure humanitarianism will seek ways to prevent the infesting of the flour
('15', 469, 0, 1, 919399) 470 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 469, 1, 2, 919441) and keeping the body from becoming unclean.
('15', 469, 1, 3, 919485) So also, pure humanitarianism will look for the cause of surreptitious admissions and take measures to promote moral purity.
('15', 469, 1, 4, 919610) It will not encourage and shield laxity by accepting the burden of such admissions.
('15', 469, 1, 5, 919694) I need hardly say that my criticism is only meant to be helpful and is not prompted by a desire to cast aspersions.
('15', 469, 1, 6, 919810) It is also not true that all the comments apply to every institution.
('15', 469, 1, 7, 919880) The sole purpose of this article is to see that all the institutions attain the highest possible level.
('15', 469, 1, 8, 919984) In almost all our institutions, we notice more of the attitude of the vanik 1 than anything else.
('15', 469, 1, 9, 920082) It is imperative to keep this in the background and give prominence to the (venturesome) spirit of the Kshatriya, to the (far sighted) vision of the Brahmin, above all, to the Sudras spirit (of service).

('15', 469, 6, 14, 920387) MY DEAR ESTHER,
('15', 469, 7, 15, 920403) I have just returned from Ranchi to find your letter awaiting me.
('15', 469, 7, 16, 920469) You never told me you had taken to vegetarianism.
('15', 469, 7, 17, 920519) I am sure it is the proper thing for this climate, apart from its religious value.
('15', 469, 7, 18, 920602) A convert to vegetarianism is often told to eat of pulses, butter, cheese and milk more than during the meat eating period.
('15', 469, 7, 19, 920726) This is a mistake.
('15', 469, 7, 20, 920745) Pulses may be eaten only sparingly.
('15', 469, 7, 21, 920781) If one takes a fair quantity of milk, very little butter is required.
('15', 469, 7, 22, 920851) In my opinion, it is wrong to possess unnecessary things; they presuppose defence of things possessed against those who may covet them.
('15', 469, 7, 23, 920987) They require care and attention which might well be devoted to more important matters and loss of them always leaves a pang, no matter how detached you may feel about them.

('15', 470, 5, 10, 921772) Napkins and handkerchiefs too are needed.
('15', 470, 5, 11, 921814) Also some kind of cloth for scarves.
('15', 470, 5, 12, 921851) And caps as well.
('15', 470, 5, 13, 921869) Cant the women living there be asked to work on these?
('15', 470, 5, 14, 921924) They may be paid a small amount.
('15', 470, 5, 15, 921957) The caps must be hand stitched, even if they cost more.
('15', 470, 5, 16, 922013) Did you get my letter 1 about Santok?
('15', 470, 5, 17, 922051) It has not been acknowledged.
('15', 470, 5, 18, 922081) Tell Fulchand not to send me the accounts every week.
('15', 470, 5, 19, 922135) It will be enough if he sends, from time to time, items of special note.
('15', 470, 5, 20, 922208) 1. How much Hindi, and how well, is the Swamiji able to teach?

('15', 471, 2, 3, 922816) BETTIAH, July 19, 1917
('15', 471, 3, 4, 922839) The Champaran Agrarian Enquiry Committee resumed their sitting today.
('15', 471, 3, 5, 922909) At the outset the Chairman 1 said some of the written statements put before them contained events relating to specific acts of coercion alleged to have occurred many years ago.
('15', 471, 3, 6, 923086) Some were about twenty or twenty five years old.
('15', 471, 3, 7, 923135) It was quite impossible for them for their inquiry to extend back to such remote periods.
('15', 471, 3, 8, 923225) Their inquiry related to the present agrarian conditions of Champaran District and their concern with the past history would be inasmuch as it would elucidate present conditions.
('15', 471, 3, 9, 923404) He did not think any advantage would accrue by inquiring into individual cases that occurred a long number of years ago and he ruled the Committee should confine itself to more recent events for the reason that there was a special inquiry made by Mr. Gourlay in 1909 which dealt with all agrarian conditions prior to that date and he proposed the Committee should undertake only an inquiry of conditions after Mr. Gourlays inquiry.
('15', 471, 3, 10, 923836) That seemed to him to be the reasonable time to adopt.
('15', 471, 3, 11, 923891) The second point he wished to put forward was that certain incidents referred to matters which had been the subject of decisions of judicial courts of the country.
('15', 471, 3, 12, 924055) Again, it would be useless for them to attempt to review those cases.
('15', 471, 3, 13, 924125) Already those cases had been heard and decided by judicial courts and it was not in the province of the Committee to revise the decisions of the judicial courts of the country.
('15', 471, 3, 14, 924302) Therefore, so far as those cases were concerned, all that they could consider was the judicial record and not any extra facts connected with it.
('15', 471, 4, 15, 924447) Mr. Gandhi said he wished to say just a few words on the subject as he was responsible for putting in those statements.
('15', 471, 4, 16, 924567) He bowed to the Chairmans ruling but he thought it was necessary to put those matters in statement as otherwise he would not have done justice to those men unless he allowed them to give their story in its historical sequence.
('15', 471, 4, 17, 924794) He did not wish the Committee to go behind judicial decisions, but he thought the Committee should have an opportunity of having the full story of the ryots.
('15', 471, 5, 18, 924952) The Chairman said they could not enquire into allegations that judgements of courts were based on false facts.
('15', 471, 6, 19, 925063) Mr. Gandhi said he agreed, but he thought it was proper not to withhold anything from the Committee.

('15', 472, 3, 4, 925330) Mr. Gandhi, who questioned witness [Mr. A. Ammon 1], said the case about Sant Raut was not that his house was looted, but that when he returned in January he found his field granaries, grain, utensils, sal tree logs, etc.
('15', 472, 3, 5, 925552) looted.
('15', 472, 4, 6, 925560) Witness replied that it was not true, so far as he knew.
('15', 472, 4, 7, 925617) He did not know that Sant had filed a petition a few days before the alleged occurrence before the magistrate saying he was in fear of these things being looted.
('15', 472, 4, 8, 925779) He heard of the loot for the first time from the newspapers.

('15', 472, 8, 12, 925940) MAGANLAL, Your birthday has come and gone.
('15', 472, 8, 13, 925983) That means your body has one year less to live.
('15', 472, 8, 14, 926031) I have built on you hopes much like Shaikhchallis 2, so that in wishing continuing growth of purity in you, I serve my interest as well.
('15', 472, 8, 15, 926168) You are all that I have and all I desire.
('15', 472, 8, 16, 926210) It is my prayer to God and my blessing to you that you realize all your high aspirations, live long and grow healthier, that you become an ideal for your family, for the country and the world at large.

('15', 473, 3, 4, 926843) TO THE SECRETARY PASSENGERS GRIEVANCES COMMITTEE
('15', 473, 4, 5, 926892) RANGOON
('15', 473, 5, 6, 926900) SIR, I have the honour to submit the enclosed note on the matter before your Committee for its consideration.
('15', 473, 7, 7, 927010) Yours faithfully,
('15', 473, 8, 8, 927028) [ENCLOSURE]
('15', 473, 11, 9, 927040) GRIEVANCES
('15', 473, 12, 10, 927051) The undersigned has considerable experience of travelling, having travelled in several parts of the world during the past 25 years.
('15', 473, 13, 11, 927183) The undersigned had occasion during 1901 1 and again in 1915 2
('15', 473, 14, 12, 927246) to travel to Burma.
('15', 473, 14, 13, 927266) The undersigned used to travel, as a rule, first class up to nearly 4 years ago.
('15', 473, 14, 14, 927347) Latterly he has travelled as a deck passenger.
('15', 473, 14, 15, 927394) In the opinion of the undersigned: 1. Deck passengers making use of the British India Steam Navigation Service do not receive adequate attention from the Companys employees or the police.
('15', 473, 14, 16, 927582) 2. The passengers are hustled about by both, are spoken to roughly, often sworn at and not unoften assaulted.
('15', 473, 14, 17, 927692) 3. The employees do not put themselves out for receiving complaints.
('15', 473, 14, 18, 927761) 4. The crew maltreat the passengers and almost invariably take

('15', 474, 1, 2, 927981) bribes.
('15', 474, 1, 3, 927989) 5. Passengers are huddled together anyhow, there being absolutely no supervision as to how and where they seat themselves; the result is that the strongest or the richest secure the best accommodation.
('15', 474, 1, 4, 928191) 6. Female passengers are similarly treated as in clause (5) and have no privacy of any kind reserved for them.
('15', 474, 1, 5, 928302) 7. The deck is often in a filthy condition.
('15', 474, 1, 6, 928346) 8. There is no control over the passengers behaviour; the result is that dirty passengers spit and eat anywhere and anyhow, much to the discomfort of the cleanly ones.
('15', 474, 1, 7, 928514) 9. Closets are filthy beyond description; closets allotted for females are often used by men; Mrs. Gandhi had to be specially accompanied each time she wanted to use the closets.
('15', 474, 1, 8, 928693) There are, as a rule, no locks to the doors.
('15', 474, 1, 9, 928738) 10. Bathing accommodation, such as it is, is often taken up by the crew.
('15', 474, 1, 10, 928811) There is hardly any facility for washing clothes.
('15', 474, 1, 11, 928861) 11. Accommodation referred to in (9) and (10) is too little for the number of passengers taken.
('15', 474, 1, 12, 928957) 12. During his voyages, the undersigned felt that the passengers taken were too many for the space reserved for deck passengers.
('15', 474, 1, 13, 929086) 13. There seemed to be no control over the disposition of the luggage of the passengers; the result was that much space was taken up by the passengers luggage.
('15', 474, 1, 14, 929246) 14. The undersigned found that through ignorance, fear, laziness and such other causes, passengers seemed to be reluctant to make complaints.
('15', 474, 2, 15, 929388) REMEDIES
('15', 474, 3, 16, 929397) PART II In the opinion of the undersigned: 1. There should be special, trusted representatives of the Company approved by the Government who would go out of their way to understand deck passengers and their grievances.
('15', 474, 3, 17, 929616) 2. For the wharves assistance of trustworthy volunteers should be sought from known organisations conducted in the interest of the passengers.
('15', 474, 3, 18, 929759) 3. Deck, closet and bathing accommodation should be increased.
('15', 475, 0, 1, 929822) 476 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 475, 1, 2, 929864) 4. The representatives mentioned in clause (1) of Part II should inspect every ship and satisfy themselves as to [clause] (3) [of] Part II.
('15', 475, 1, 3, 930004) 5. The representatives aforesaid should meet every steamer and inquire of the passengers as to their experiences.
('15', 475, 1, 4, 930118) 6. Medical Officer on board should be empowered and be expected to look after the physical comforts of the passengers in every way.
('15', 475, 1, 5, 930250) The undersigned was told by a medical officer that the looking after the accomodation of passengers, their cleanliness, the closet arrangement, their condition did not fall within his province.
('15', 475, 1, 6, 930444) 7. An instruction book in several vernaculars should be issued for the passengers and a copy handed to each passenger on his receiving his ticket.
('15', 475, 1, 7, 930591) Should the Committee desire further information from the undersigned, he will gladly endeavour to give it.

('15', 476, 3, 4, 931915) DEAR SHANKERLAL AND JAMNADAS,
('15', 476, 4, 5, 931945) I have already replied to the telegrams from both of you.
('15', 476, 4, 6, 932003) Except for going there, I have done everything I could.
('15', 476, 4, 7, 932059) And I would have gone if it had at all been possible.
('15', 476, 4, 8, 932113) The Champaran Committee has been working without interruption.
('15', 476, 4, 9, 932176) Its tenure is for three months.
('15', 476, 4, 10, 932208) The time limit has been set by me.
('15', 476, 4, 11, 932243) How can I ask it to suspend its functioning for a week?
('15', 476, 4, 12, 932299) And how can I remain absent?
('15', 476, 4, 13, 932328) If this task is accomplished you can take it that it will be a great step forward towards swaraj.
('15', 476, 4, 14, 932426) I must not harm it in any way.
('15', 476, 5, 15, 932457) However, I am sure that if all of you remain firm on the path of truth, nothing will go wrong there either.
('15', 476, 5, 16, 932565) I am prepared to fight by your side even in the face of the opposition from the whole country.
('15', 476, 5, 17, 932660) I do not have the strength to handle the work single handed.
('15', 476, 5, 18, 932721) After settling the affairs there, both or either one of you should come over if possible.
('15', 476, 5, 19, 932811) More I shall explain.

('15', 477, 2, 3, 933295) MOTIHARI, July 26, 1917
('15', 477, 3, 4, 933319) The only witness examined today by the Champaran Agrarian Enquiry Committee was Mr. W. S. Irwin, Manager of Motihari Limited.
('15', 477, 3, 5, 933445) Examined by the Chairman, witness said his concern consisted of six factories.
('15', 477, 3, 6, 933524) It was an indigo concern before, but it was not now.
('15', 477, 3, 7, 933577) He converted the tinkathia system in 1911 by taking their tawan of sharahbeshi.
('15', 477, 3, 8, 933657) Under the tinkathia obligation every ryot had to work three cottahs 2 of indigo.
('15', 477, 3, 9, 933738) The claim was against every ryot.
('15', 477, 3, 10, 933772) Witness had taken sharahbeshi in mukarrari villages and tawan in thikadari villages.
('15', 477, 4, 11, 933857) Asked whether he claimed that an exclusive right was created because the Raj had allowed it, witness said that the Raj had taken a good deal more than they were allowed to collect under the terms of their leases.
('15', 477, 4, 12, 934070) When he said Government recognised the obligation he meant that they recognised it tacitly, because they said that so long as indigo was grown rents could not be raised.
('15', 477, 5, 13, 934240) Witness then gave similar evidence to the previous witnesses about the imposition of fines and employment of labour.
('15', 477, 6, 14, 934357) To Mr. Gandhi, witness said he had not fined any person Rs. 500/ when told that Mr. Gandhi had a man who alleged witness had fined him a thousand rupees.
('15', 477, 6, 15, 934511) Witness said:
('15', 477, 7, 16, 934525) If Mr. Gandhi were to remain in this part of the country for the length of time I have (and it is 35 years), he would be convinced what a consummate liar the Champaran ryot is. There were several good qualities in the Champaran ryot, but certainly truth was not one of them.
('15', 477, 7, 17, 934800) Before his letter to The Pioneer, there was not a
('15', 477, 8, 18, 934850) single complaint made against him.
('15', 477, 9, 19, 934885) Mr. Gandhi said that from Mr. Heycocks (Collectors) summary, it appeared during the last four years, 27 petitions had been sent to the Collector from 20 different villages against the factory.
('15', 477, 10, 20, 935078) Witness said he had thirty thousand tenants, and if in four years 27 petitions were sent, it was natural they might not come to his notice.
('15', 477, 11, 21, 935218) Witness was next questioned about specific cases of oppression and in one it was alleged he had destroyed the crop of one Lakhan Rai.
('15', 477, 12, 22, 935352) 1 This report is included in full as a sample of such reports.

('15', 478, 0, 1, 935514) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 479
('15', 478, 1, 2, 935556) Witness said that in November 1914 at a court auction sale he had purchased a
('15', 478, 2, 3, 935634) certain plot of one Alam.
('15', 478, 2, 4, 935660) A portion of the holding was in Lakhan Rais name as a
('15', 478, 3, 5, 935714) sub ryot, but at the attestation Lakhan Rai told the SettlementOfficer he was no
('15', 478, 4, 6, 935795) longer a sub ryot.
('15', 478, 4, 7, 935814) Witness here produced a certified copy to substantiate his
('15', 478, 5, 8, 935873) statement and aid that at the time there was a crop of oats on the land and he let
('15', 478, 6, 9, 935956) Lakhan Rai have half of it.
('15', 478, 6, 10, 935984) In May last he ordered the whole of this land to be prepared for indigo and it was then discovered that in two cottahs in a corner Lakhan
('15', 478, 7, 11, 936122) Rai had surreptitiously sown china.
('15', 478, 7, 12, 936158) This he had absolutely no right to do, and
('15', 478, 8, 13, 936201) witness man ploughed up the whole land.
('15', 478, 8, 14, 936241) The crop was of wry poor quality and the
('15', 478, 9, 15, 936282) damage was very slight.
('15', 478, 10, 16, 936306) With regard to a second incident about which he was asked, witness admitted
('15', 478, 11, 17, 936382) that to a certain extent he was in the wrong.
('15', 478, 11, 18, 936428) The story relating to this incident, he said, was that about the 23rd May last his Gumashta 1 reported to him that three
('15', 478, 12, 19, 936549) factory carts had gone to complainants village to bring the factorys half share of batai bhusa.
('15', 478, 12, 20, 936645) There at the instigation of Bataidar, his cartmen assaulted and the bhusa
('15', 478, 13, 21, 936719) was thrown from the carts.
('15', 478, 13, 22, 936746) When the men went to witness he admitted he gave them a
('15', 478, 14, 23, 936802) few cuts on the leg with a light riding cane, but he was very angry at the time.
('15', 478, 15, 24, 936883) had assaulted his men badly.
('15', 478, 15, 25, 936912) It was true he had threatened to fine them, but he had not
('15', 478, 16, 26, 936971) actually done so.
('15', 478, 16, 27, 936989) As for their being shut up in witnesss hen house, it was absolutely
('15', 478, 17, 28, 937057) The men were nowhere near it.
('15', 478, 18, 29, 937087) MR. GANDHI: Then half of the ryots story is true?
('15', 478, 19, 30, 937137) It was true he had converted some of the ryots lands into zirat lands, but he
('15', 478, 20, 31, 937215) had given lands in exchange and there was no complaint about it.
('15', 478, 20, 32, 937280) On the exchange
('15', 478, 21, 33, 937296) lands, the ryots had actually sown and reaped their crops.
('15', 478, 21, 34, 937355) Witness had to convert these lands, as it was necessary to have all zirat lands in one place to ensure effective
('15', 478, 22, 35, 937468) supervision.
('15', 478, 22, 36, 937481) It was the practice in all zamindaris to effect this exchange of lands.
('15', 478, 23, 37, 937553) This concluded witnesss evidence and the Committee shortly after left for
('15', 478, 24, 38, 937627) Bettiah to go to villages in the interior where they intend to have local inspection.

('15', 479, 2, 3, 937844) GUEST HOUSE, BETTIAH, July 27, 1917
('15', 479, 4, 4, 937880) POUNDSMr. Gandhi considered that pounds should be directly managed by the Board and not auctioned.
('15', 479, 5, 5, 937979) (1) Cost of Cultivation:Mr. Reid said it cost planters Rs. 7 to Rs. 8 per acre for zirat cultivation.
('15', 479, 5, 6, 938081) Raja Kirtyanand Sinha 1 confirmed this from his own experience.
('15', 479, 5, 7, 938145) Mr. Gandhi said that raiyats estimated it not below
('15', 479, 6, 8, 938197) Rs. 20 or Rs. 25 per acre, but he would examine the question further after seeing the factory book.
('15', 479, 7, 9, 938297) Mr. Gandhi urged that voluntary contracts should be limited to one year.
('15', 479, 8, 10, 938370) SHARAHBESHIAs regards enhancement of rent in lieu of tinkathia (sharahbeshi) recognized at the resettlement, Mr. Gandhi thought that it ought to be
('15', 479, 9, 11, 938518) revised and reduced to the ordinary enhancement allowed for rise in prices.
('15', 479, 9, 12, 938594) The President and other members were not prepared to agree and it was pointed out that under the law the enhancement could not be touched in most cases.
('15', 479, 10, 13, 938747) TAWANAll agreed that tawan was an unjustifiable practice and should be
('15', 479, 11, 14, 938818) stopped for the future.
('15', 479, 11, 15, 938842) The question was then discussed as to what action, if any, should be taken in cases where it had already been taken.
('15', 479, 11, 16, 938959) Mr. Gandhi thought that where sums had already been paid, no action could be taken, but that factories should be required to cancel all outstanding debts on this account.
('15', 479, 11, 17, 939130) He recognized that this could only be applied to factories which were still the property of the persons who had taken the bonds and had not been sold in the meantime.
('15', 479, 11, 18, 939297) This could be enforced by the Court of Wards refusing to renew the leases of thikadars 2 who refused to agree to
('15', 479, 12, 19, 939410) this arrangement.
('15', 479, 12, 20, 939428) Other members felt that there were difficulties in the proposal which required further consideration.

('15', 480, 3, 4, 939888) 2. If in the case of existing thikas the estate decided to renew the leases, (they)

('15', 481, 2, 3, 941112) BETTIAH, July 29, 1917
('15', 481, 3, 4, 941135) In my humble opinion (1) the existence of the committee is due to the evils of the tinkathia system; (2) its chief function is to deal with it in an equitable manner; and (3) it is expected to make such recommendations as would settle the matter once for all, would restore harmony between zamindars or thikadars and the raiyats andwould prevent future disputes whether in the shape of law suits or otherwise.
('15', 481, 3, 5, 941545) If tinkathia is abolished for a consideration, the committee will have neglected its primary duty.
('15', 481, 3, 6, 941644) The committee has been appointed in spite of the tinkathia system being the subject matter of a law suit.
('15', 481, 3, 7, 941750) The committee has overwhelming proof before it to know that tinkathia has bound the raiyat like the coil of a serpent from which whether it be legal or not the raiyats have ever striven to get free and from which the Government have hitherto made unsuccessful attempts to free them.
('15', 481, 3, 8, 942033) Official evidence before us goes to show that it has taxed the officials wit to the utmost in their endeavour to get out of it; they attribute everything to tinkathia.
('15', 481, 3, 9, 942201) There is much truth in Mr. Whittys remark that though he can produce no direct evidence to show that tinkathia is responsible for the abwabs, etc., he has felt it to be so.
('15', 481, 3, 10, 942374) In the circumstances the committee, I venture to submit, is bound to condemn it in unequivocal terms and advise its abolition without any consideration whatsoever being paid by the raiyats.
('15', 481, 3, 11, 942564) The legality of slavery, when once its sinfulness was recognized, did not require a price from the slave for his freedom.
('15', 481, 3, 12, 942686) It is submitted therefore that the least the committee can do is: (1) to abolish tinkathia unconditionally; (2) to abolish sharahbeshi without interference with the past collections at the sharahbeshi rates; (3) to cancel sharahbeshi whether registered as a matter of contract or compromise subject however to enhancement of the pre sharahbeshi rent as in kham 1 or thika villages.

('15', 482, 0, 1, 943104) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 483
('15', 482, 1, 2, 943146) The result of such a settlement will mean withdrawal of the High Court case and lasting peace so far as tinkathia and sharahbeshi are concerned.
('15', 482, 1, 3, 943291) The result of leaving the matter to be decided as a matter of law pure and simple will be a fruitful source of interminable disputes in which the longest purse alone must win.
('15', 482, 1, 4, 943467) It will promote bitterness between parties and reopening of many cases in the event of the raiyats winning, decided under the Sweeney 1 Settlement and will mean a loss to the landlord of the enhancement offered under the foregoing scheme.
('15', 482, 1, 5, 943706) Neither the Government nor the committee can contemplate with equanimity such a state of things.
('15', 482, 1, 6, 943803) Finally, if tawan is bad, sharahbeshi is worse from the raiyats standpoint.
('15', 482, 1, 7, 943879) The former has pinched the present party, the latter leaves a legacy to generations yet unborn.
('15', 482, 1, 8, 943975) We know too that sharahbeshi was proposed and taken when indigo was no longer a profitable proposition for the planter and that the Rajpur concern has shown that khuski indigo has been taken up practically without any extra cost to the planter.
('15', 482, 1, 9, 944220) So with sharahbeshi he has a fair prospect of having obtained the utmost enhancement in his rents and a continuance of profits from indigo under another form.

('15', 483, 6, 8, 945367) NADIAD, August 3, 1917
('15', 483, 7, 9, 945390) MY DEAR ESTHER, You have raised big questions.
('15', 483, 7, 10, 945437) I think the command of Jesus is unequivocal.
('15', 483, 7, 11, 945482) All killing is bad for one who is filled with love.
('15', 483, 7, 12, 945534) He will not need to kill.
('15', 483, 7, 13, 945560) He will not kill.
('15', 483, 7, 14, 945578) He who is filled with pity for the snake and does not fear him will not kill him and the snake will not hurt him.
('15', 483, 7, 15, 945692) This state of innocence is the one we must reach.
('15', 483, 7, 16, 945742) But only a few can reach it.
('15', 483, 7, 17, 945771) It seems to me to be impossible for nations to reach it.
('15', 483, 7, 18, 945828) Equal progress in all is an inconceivable situation.
('15', 483, 7, 19, 945881) Nations will therefore always fight.
('15', 483, 7, 20, 945918) One of them will be less wrong than the other.
('15', 483, 7, 21, 945965) A nation to be in the right can only fight with soul force.
('15', 483, 7, 22, 946025) Such a nation has still to be born.
('15', 483, 7, 23, 946061) I had hoped that India was that nation.
('15', 483, 7, 24, 946101) I fear I was wrong.
('15', 483, 7, 25, 946121) The utmost I expect of India is that she may become a great restraining force.
('15', 483, 7, 26, 946200) But she must acquire the ability to fight and suffer before she can speak to the world with any degree of effect.The pertinent question for you and me is what is our duty as individuals.
('15', 483, 7, 27, 946387) I have come to this workable decision for myself, I will not kill anyone for any cause whatsoever but be killed by him if resistance or his will render my being killed necessary. I would give similar advice to everybody.
('15', 483, 7, 28, 946608) But where I know that there is want of will altogether, I would advise him to exert his will and fight.
('15', 483, 7, 29, 946712) There is no love where there is no will.
('15', 483, 7, 30, 946753) In India there is not only no love but hatred due to emasculation.
('15', 483, 7, 31, 946820) There is the strongest desire to fight and kill side by side with utter helplessness.
('15', 483, 7, 32, 946906) This desire must be satisfied by restoring the capacity for fighting.
('15', 483, 7, 33, 946976) Then comes the choice.
('15', 483, 7, 34, 946999) Yes, the very act of forgiving and loving shows superiority in the doer.
('15', 483, 7, 35, 947072) But that way of putting the proposition begs the question, who can love?
('15', 483, 7, 36, 947145) A mouse as mouse cannot love a cat.
('15', 483, 7, 37, 947181) A mouse cannot

('15', 484, 1, 2, 947238) be commonly said to refrain from hurting a cat.
('15', 484, 1, 3, 947286) You do not love him whom you fear.
('15', 484, 1, 4, 947321) Immediately you cease to fear, you are ready for your choiceto strike or to refrain.
('15', 484, 1, 5, 947406) To refrain is proof of awakening of the soul in man; to strike is proof of body force.
('15', 484, 1, 6, 947493) The ability to strike must be present when the power of the soul is demonstrated.
('15', 484, 1, 7, 947575) This does not mean that we must be bodily superior to the adversary.
('15', 484, 1, 8, 947644) This is not a satisfactory letter but I think you will follow my argument.
('15', 484, 1, 9, 947719) But in matters such, as these, prayer is the thing.

('15', 484, 12, 23, 948261) Mr. Gandhi suggested that the report should specify the more general kinds of abwab, so that there could be no doubt as to their condemnation.
('15', 484, 12, 24, 948404) This was agreed to.
('15', 484, 14, 25, 948424) FINESThe outstanding point to be settled about fines was the recommendation in respect of cases to which the landlord was a party.
('15', 484, 14, 26, 948555) The President
('15', 484, 15, 27, 948569) 1 Found with Gandhijis correspondence of 1917, the letter is placed in that year.

('15', 485, 1, 2, 948750) said that, in his opinion, to adopt Mr. Gandhis suggestion that in all such cases the matter should go to a court would be injurious to the raiyats and would moreover
('15', 485, 2, 3, 948917) require legislation.
('15', 485, 2, 4, 948938) He thought Mr. Gandhis objection might be met if it were clearly laid down and understood
('15', 485, 3, 5, 949028) (1) that the payment was entirely voluntary,
('15', 485, 4, 6, 949073) (2) that if the raiyat thought he was not liable, or that the payment was
('15', 485, 5, 7, 949147) excessive, it was open for him to refuse to pay.
('15', 485, 6, 8, 949196) Mr. Gandhi said that as the fines were few, so also would be the number of cases in which the landlords would have to report to the court.
('15', 485, 6, 9, 949335) He thought the power of the landlord over the raiyats was so great that it would be difficult to ensure that
('15', 485, 7, 10, 949444) payments were voluntary.
('15', 485, 7, 11, 949469) After some discussion it was agreed, on the suggestion of Mr. Reid, that the assessing of damages should be left to arbitration....

('15', 485, 14, 17, 949754) I got your letter.
('15', 485, 14, 18, 949773) It has been misplaced; moreover, being very busy with my work, I forgot all about it.
('15', 485, 14, 19, 949859) I can hardly keep an account of births and deaths.
('15', 485, 14, 20, 949910) In these matters, I have ceased to be of any use to the family.
('15', 485, 14, 21, 949974) These tides and ebbs scarcely affect me either.
('15', 485, 14, 22, 950022) This is the third death in the family I have heard of in recent days.
('15', 485, 14, 23, 950092) I think for a moment and then the thing goes out of my mind.
('15', 485, 14, 24, 950153) This condition has come to me with no effort on my part but I feel it is worth while cultivating it.
('15', 485, 14, 25, 950254) Death is but an inevitable transformation of the present state.
('15', 485, 14, 26, 950318) Why should it occasion fear?
('15', 485, 14, 27, 950347) Birth is also a sign of the same process of change.
('15', 485, 14, 28, 950399) Why do we hail it with joy?
('15', 485, 14, 29, 950427) The aspiration for deliverance from both the contingencies, for us as well as for the whole world, is described as supreme purushartha 1, Such being the case, what consolation shall I give to Anand?
('15', 485, 14, 30, 950626) She is given to religious
('15', 485, 15, 31, 950652) 1 Deliverance from both birth and death is the last of the four ends of life, viz., dharma, artha (material prosperity), kama (pleasure), moksha (liberation).

('15', 486, 8, 9, 951090) (1) Cost of Cultivation 1: Mr. Gandhi said that he had not yet got certain
('15', 486, 9, 10, 951165) figures from Mr. Jameson 2 but subject to anything new that these might disclose, it was recorded as the conclusion of the Committee that the maximum cost was Rs. 15 per bigha (8_ hath laggi 3) or Rs. 10 an
('15', 486, 11, 11, 951372) (2) Mr. Gandhi said the cost of seed of country crops was small but the President remarked that for rabi 4 crops, it was a considerable item.
('15', 486, 12, 12, 951514) Khuski IndigoMr. Gandhi suggested that a minimum rate should be fixed for khuski indigo.
('15', 486, 12, 13, 951603) Mr. Reid thought that there might be a danger of this suggestion
('15', 486, 13, 14, 951668) extending to other crops, e.g., sugarcane.
('15', 486, 13, 15, 951711) After discussion it was agreed that during the transition stage in view of the past history of indigo, it was desirable that the Association, with the approval of the Commissioner, should fix a minimum rate for khuski indigo, the transition stage being considered to last until Government was satisfied that the raiyats knew that they need not grow indigo unless they liked.
('15', 486, 15, 16, 952086) Compensation for abolition of tinkathiaThe next point for discussion was
('15', 486, 16, 17, 952159) whether on abolition of the system, compensation was to be allowed in case where the growing of indigo was recorded as an incident of the tenancy.
('15', 486, 16, 18, 952306) The President, in putting his view before the Committee, said he was anxious to remove anything unjust to the raiyats.
('15', 486, 16, 19, 952425) He thought that perhaps Mr. Gandhi from his experience of a

('15', 487, 2, 4, 952771) before the meeting was that a special court should be created to deal with these cases.
('15', 487, 2, 5, 952859) This court would decide, subject to appeal to a special judge,
('15', 487, 3, 6, 952922) (a) if the incident of tenancy existed, and if so
('15', 487, 4, 7, 952972) (b) a fair rate for commutation of the incident.
('15', 487, 5, 8, 953021) The commutation should be made by an addition to rent and not by a lump sum.
('15', 487, 5, 9, 953098) In fixing a fair rent as commutation, the court should
('15', 487, 6, 10, 953153) (a) consider the loss incurred by the raiyat under tinkathia
('15', 487, 7, 11, 953214) (b) the actual enhanced rents paid in similar circumstances for commutation, and
('15', 487, 8, 12, 953295) (c) in no circumstances fix a total rent which was not fair and equitable
('15', 487, 9, 13, 953369) The enhancement might be made progressive if it exceeded 25 per cent.
('15', 487, 10, 14, 953439) Mr. Gandhi said he did not wish to enter into legal points but merely to regard the question from the point of view of equity.
('15', 487, 10, 15, 953566) The result of the proposal would be that raiyats in villages under direct management would be placed in a better position than raiyats in indigo villages, although the latter had borne this heavy burden in the past
('15', 487, 11, 16, 953781) which was inequitable.
('15', 487, 11, 17, 953804) He thought that the evil of the system had not been properly recognised by the Committee.
('15', 487, 11, 18, 953894) Government had never agreed that indigo growing was an obligation, and all the papers showed that the system and its accompaniments formed an intolerable burden on the raiyats.
('15', 487, 11, 19, 954071) The proposal did not free the raiyats; on
('15', 487, 12, 20, 954113) the other hand, it was a free gift to the planters, it was the planters who wished to give up indigo because, whatever might be the case now, indigo was not paying when the conversions were made, and it was not fair to the raiyats to make them pay for
('15', 487, 13, 21, 954365) giving up indigo.
('15', 487, 13, 22, 954383) He had considered the matter from the landlords point of view, as was shown by his agreement in the matter of tawan.
('15', 487, 13, 23, 954500) In the present question, he could not separate the raiyats of mukarrari villages from those of thika villages.
('15', 487, 14, 24, 954611) were in the same position and should be regarded in the same way.
('15', 487, 14, 25, 954677) He could not therefore agree to anything beyond an enhancement of rent under the ordinary provision of the law, and opposed any special enhancement in lieu of tinkathia.
('15', 487, 15, 26, 954847) foresaw complications in the action proposed.
('15', 487, 15, 27, 954893) A settlement by a special court would take some months, which was undesirable in the present state of unrest.
('15', 487, 15, 28, 955003) An immediate and automatic remedy was required, and this would be the merit of his suggestion of an enhancement at a fixed rate on the ground of the rise in prices, that is, of 3 annas in the rupee all round.
('15', 487, 16, 29, 955212) The President pointed out that in comparing the position of the non indigo raiyats with the indigo raiyats, it had to be considered that in villages where abwab were taken, they were higher than sharahbeshi, and, that where abwab were not taken (e.g., Madhuban Estate), the rent was enhanced to a
('15', 488, 0, 1, 955509) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 489
('15', 488, 1, 2, 955551) higher pitch than elsewhere.
('15', 488, 1, 3, 955580) Admittedly in Bettiah kham villages these
('15', 488, 2, 4, 955622) considerations did not apply but it was impossible to secure absolute equality, and in any case the proposal would improve the position of the raiyat who had been
('15', 488, 3, 5, 955785) growing indigo.
('15', 488, 3, 6, 955801) As to the criticism that the proposal was a free gift to planters, he said that it was only proposed to allow an enhancement where the legal property of the planter existed and even then the full value of this property was not being given.
('15', 488, 3, 7, 956041) He did not think the difficulties of the special court would be great.
('15', 488, 3, 8, 956112) The settlement records would give a good basis and the area to be dealt with was not large.
('15', 488, 4, 9, 956204) Mr. Rainy 1 said the proposal was similar to that adopted in Chhota Nagpur where legislation compelled the computation of predial conditions.
('15', 488, 4, 10, 956346) He denied that Government had never recognised the fact that the obligation might be an incident of tenancy, for section 29 proviso (iii) was clear evidence that they had and so was the Boards letter No.
('15', 488, 4, 11, 956550) 5032 R(A) dated the 16th October, 1912, regarding Mr. Irwins sharahbeshi.
('15', 488, 4, 12, 956624) Mr. Gandhi said that if the legal right was not consistent with equity or
('15', 488, 5, 13, 956698) had been grossly abused as in this case, no compensation should be given.
('15', 488, 6, 14, 956772) Mr. Reid said that most of the raiyats took their holdings under an agreement to grow indigo.
('15', 488, 6, 15, 956866) Mr. Gandhi said the complaint was not against indigo itself but against the manner and method of growing it.
('15', 488, 6, 16, 956975) the complaint was not against the system but against the moral and intellectual damage caused by it to the raiyats by keeping them backward.
('15', 488, 6, 17, 957116) The President pointed out that his proposal gave much to the raiyats, viz., freedom
('15', 488, 7, 18, 957200) (1) from growing indigo if they did not wish,
('15', 488, 8, 19, 957246) (2) from having their best lands selected for indigo,
('15', 488, 9, 20, 957300) (3) from supervision by factory servants,
('15', 488, 10, 21, 957342) (4) from paying compensation for this freedom except in cases where the obligation was the legal property of the landlord and even then full compensation would not be given.
('15', 488, 11, 22, 957516) Mr. Gandhi said that this included nothing that was not offered by the planters themselves but Mr. Rainy pointed out that whereas the planters offered their own terms, the proposal contemplated that they should be compelled to accept terms fixed by a court.
('15', 488, 12, 23, 957774) The President said that Mr. Gandhis position practically amounted to the proposition that the raiyats should get off paying an equitable rent on the ground of past oppression, which position did not appear to him to be sound.
('15', 488, 13, 24, 958000) At this stage, the meeting adjourned.

('15', 489, 2, 3, 958270) August 11, 1917
('15', 489, 3, 4, 958286) Resuming the discussion of the previous day, Mr. Gandhi said that the average amount of sharahbeshi taken was about 50 per cent of the rent.
('15', 489, 3, 5, 958427) The note circulated by
('15', 489, 4, 6, 958450) Raja Kirtyanand Sinha suggested a compromise of an enhancement of four annas in the rupee to cover sharahbeshi and ordinary enhancement on the score of rise in
('15', 489, 5, 7, 958610) prices.
('15', 489, 5, 8, 958618) He was anxious to meet the views of his fellow members so far as that was possible, and he was prepared to agree to a small enhancement over and above that admissible for a rise in prices but would not support a penal enhancement.
('15', 489, 5, 9, 958849) The greatest difficulty would be as regards the sharahbeshi already taken.
('15', 489, 5, 10, 958924) He thought that
('15', 489, 6, 11, 958940) anything very much larger than the enhancement allowed for the rise in prices would be near the danger point.
('15', 489, 6, 12, 959050) The President said that he understood the proposal to be that, in cases where the obligation to grow indigo existed as an incident of tenancy or had been commuted by sharahbeshi, a slight enhancement though not a penal one in
('15', 489, 7, 13, 959276) excess of the enhancement generally admissible for a rise in prices should be allowed.
('15', 489, 7, 14, 959363) He pointed out that it was impossible to fix a definite figure for the total enhancement, because it was still uncertain what enhancement would eventually be allowed by the courts on account of the rise in prices.
('15', 489, 7, 15, 959577) The proposal therefore could only refer to the amount of enhancement above this figure.
('15', 489, 7, 16, 959665) He asked Mr. Gandhi to what extra enhancement he was prepared to agree.
('15', 489, 7, 17, 959737) Mr. Gandhi said he thought not more than one anna in the rupee.
('15', 489, 8, 18, 959801) The President said that the facts were that by a settlement between the planters and raiyats, there had been a sharahbeshi enhancement of 50 per cent, which
('15', 489, 9, 19, 959958) Mr. Gandhi thought excessive because the legal property in exchange for which this enhancement was taken was inequitable and therefore the enhancement should be reduced.
('15', 489, 9, 20, 960128) Mr. Gandhi added that there was also the fact that the tenants were not paying rents and in one case their resistance had been successful.
('15', 489, 9, 21, 960267) By adopting his suggestion, the Committee would put a stop at once to the present trouble and it was not open to the Committee to shift responsibility by suggesting another tribunal.
('15', 489, 9, 22, 960450) Mr. Adami held the view that one anna was not sufficient and, considering the difficulties which had been pointed out by Mr. Rainy, he would be inclined to adopt the suggestion of a general settlement of rents in mukarrari villages by a special
('15', 489, 10, 23, 960695) tribunal in all cases where the obligation still existed or where it had been converted.
('15', 489, 10, 24, 960784) Raja Kirtyanand Sinha supported the proposal in his note for an enhancement of four annas in the rupee.
('15', 489, 10, 25, 960888) Mr. Gandhi remarked that if Mr. Adamis proposal was accepted, the Committee would only have half done its work, but his main objection to it was
('15', 490, 0, 1, 961033) 491 VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917
('15', 490, 1, 2, 961075) that it would add to a ferment which already existed.
('15', 490, 1, 3, 961129) The Committee had the right to confer with the planters and he thought it would be far better if they could come to some agreement with the planters without the necessity of appointing any tribunal which would delay a final agreement.
('15', 490, 1, 4, 961364) Mr. Reid pointed out that the three concerns mainly affected were Motihari, Pipra and Turkaulia and he was prepared to put the proposal before these three concerns.
('15', 490, 1, 5, 961529) The President remarked that it should first be decided whether the proposal was to be put before the planters as a final one which they could adopt or not or merely as a basis for discussion.
('15', 490, 1, 6, 961721) He inclined to the latter.
('15', 490, 1, 7, 961748) There was a tremendous advantage in getting the question settled without reference to any court and, as he himself doubted whether one anna was adequate, he thought the suggestion should be used as a basis for discussion.
('15', 490, 1, 8, 961970) Mr. Gandhi said that he would not go so far as to say that he could not agree to anything above one anna, but at the same time he could not say that he would go beyond this point.
('15', 490, 1, 9, 962150) The one anna was pure concession on his part, because he did not think the raiyats should be called upon to
('15', 490, 2, 10, 962258) pay any enhancement beyond that allowed by the rise in prices.
('15', 490, 2, 11, 962321) Mr. Reid doubted if the planters would agree to anything under eight annas enhancement and pointed out that even in Pipra which had taken the biggest enhancement, the rents were only Rs. 2 an acre.
('15', 490, 3, 12, 962519) Mr. Reid then suggested that it would be a fairer proposal if the amount of sharahbeshi was reduced by a fixed percentage, say, by 25 per cent.
('15', 490, 3, 13, 962663) Mr. Gandhi said
('15', 490, 4, 14, 962679) he would be very willing to consider that as a basis for a settlement and would be prepared to go a long way to get good will established.
('15', 490, 4, 15, 962818) It was generally agreed that this was a fairer basis for discussion than the original proposal, and that Messrs Irwin 1, Hill 2, and Norman 3 should be asked to come on the following day in order that the proposal might be put to them.
('15', 490, 5, 16, 963054) TawanThe proposal left over for decision from the first meeting was that no action should be taken in cases where tawan had been already paid but that outstanding bonds on account of tawan should be cancelled.
('15', 490, 5, 17, 963264) The President said
('15', 490, 6, 18, 963283) one difficulty about this proposal was that some bonds were mixed and included amounts taken on accounts other than tawan, and some sort of enquiry would therefore
('15', 490, 7, 19, 963447) be necessary before the question of these bonds could be finally disposed of.
('15', 490, 7, 20, 963525) The other difficulty was that the proposal worked unequally both on raiyats
('15', 490, 8, 21, 963601) and planters.
('15', 490, 8, 22, 963615) Mr. Gandhi pointed out that the first difficulty could be got over by examining the factory books, and he would leave it to the Bettiah Raj to satisfy itself that outstanding amounts on account of tawan had been foregone.
('15', 490, 8, 23, 963837) Mr. Reid
('15', 490, 9, 24, 963846) said that he thought the only factory where such mixed bonds were taken was

('15', 491, 1, 2, 964085) Bairia where in some cases the debts of raiyats had been taken over and added to the tawan.
('15', 491, 1, 3, 964177) He would be inclined to apply the same suggestion to tawan that he made in the case of sharahbeshi, namely, to deduct a percentage from outstandings and to refund a percentage on the tawan already paid.
('15', 491, 1, 4, 964380) This would only apply to thika
('15', 491, 2, 5, 964411) villages.
('15', 491, 3, 6, 964421) The next point considered was whether the Raj could claim an enhancement of rent in cases where tawan had been taken.
('15', 491, 3, 7, 964539) Mr. Rainy said he was inclined to agree
('15', 491, 4, 8, 964579) to the proposal that no enhancement should be applied for in such cases, but the President felt that the interests of the Bettiah Raj also needed consideration.
('15', 491, 4, 9, 964740) He would propose that the Raj should not be debarred from claiming an enhancement of rent in cases where tawan had been taken but that for a period of years, say five, the enhanced
('15', 491, 5, 10, 964921) rent should not be realized.
('15', 491, 5, 11, 964950) Mr. Gandhi suggested that the enhancement of rent should be foregone until the following settlement.
('15', 491, 5, 12, 965051) Mr. Rainy remarked that the 15 year period could not be justified if the amount of tawan taken did not cover 15 times the
('15', 491, 6, 13, 965173) enhancement.
('15', 491, 6, 14, 965186) His idea was that the Raj should forego enhancement so far as it was covered by the tawan.
('15', 491, 6, 15, 965277) Mr. Reid pointed out that the Raj was to blame to some extent
('15', 491, 7, 16, 965339) for the position.
('15', 491, 7, 17, 965357) After discussion, it was decided to recommend that in cases where tawan had been taken, the Raj was not to be debarred from claiming enhancement but
('15', 491, 8, 18, 965506) it would forego realisation of the enhancement for a period of seven years.
('15', 491, 9, 19, 965582) Mr. Gandhi made the following proposals:
('15', 491, 10, 20, 965623) (1) That the Committee should make a general recommendation that the orders passed by Government on the Committees report should be communicated in the vernacular to the raiyats.
('15', 491, 10, 21, 965802) This was accepted.
('15', 491, 11, 22, 965821) (2) That the kerosene oil monopoly should be stopped.
('15', 491, 11, 23, 965875) This was agreed to.
('15', 491, 12, 24, 965895) (3) He proposed that raiyats should be informed that dasturi was illegal.
('15', 491, 12, 25, 965969) It was agreed to say in the report that it had been brought to notice that amla took commissions on payments which were entirely illegal and that every effort should be made to stop them and to recommend that a proclamation should be issued to the raiyats, informing them that this dasturi was not legally payable.
('15', 491, 13, 26, 966284) (4) He suggested that some officer should be deputed to enquire periodically if the orders of Government on the Committees recommendations were being carried out.
('15', 491, 13, 27, 966447) It was agreed that a paragraph should be included to emphasise that an important part of the duties of the district staff would be to see that Government orders on the recommendation were carried out which would apply especially to the staff of the Bettiah Raj until Government was satisfied that the full effect of these orders had been secured.

('15', 492, 2, 3, 966966) August 12, 1917
('15', 492, 3, 4, 966982) At the resumption of the discussion, Messrs Irwin (Motihari), Norman (Pipra) and Hill (Turkaulia) were present by invitation.
('15', 492, 3, 5, 967108) The President explained that this discussion must be entirely confidential.
('15', 492, 3, 6, 967184) The Committee had come to the unanimous conclusion that the tinkathia system should go and should be replaced by the khuski
('15', 492, 4, 7, 967308) system under short term agreement.
('15', 492, 4, 8, 967343) It had, therefore, been necessary to consider the question of the commutation of the indigo obligation both in cases where it still existed and in cases where it had already been commuted .
('15', 492, 4, 9, 967533) Mr. Gandhi had said that he was prepared to consider the possibility of a settlement on certain lines.
('15', 492, 4, 10, 967636) He, therefore, asked Mr. Gandhi to put his proposal before the planters present.
('15', 492, 4, 11, 967717) Mr. Gandhi said that his object was to promote harmony; he had no doubt that sharahbeshi had caused considerable difficulty to the raiyats, seeing the large
('15', 492, 5, 12, 967874) numbers that had protested against it.
('15', 492, 5, 13, 967913) At the time of conversion of the obligation, indigo was not profitable and it was mutually beneficial to both parties to cancel the obligation.
('15', 492, 5, 14, 968057) Any burden imposed; therefore, on the raiyats beyond the ordinary legal
('15', 492, 6, 15, 968129) enhancements was one against which they were justified in protesting.
('15', 492, 6, 16, 968199) As to the amount of the ordinary enhancement about which on the previous day there appeared to be some doubt, he referred to the judgment of the special judge in special appeal No.
('15', 492, 6, 17, 968380) 14 of 1916, and said that it appeared from that that the enhancement eventually decided on would be three annas and not four annas eight pies.
('15', 492, 6, 18, 968523) He had suggested as a concession an extra anna on account of sharahbeshi.
('15', 492, 6, 19, 968597) The planter would no doubt
('15', 492, 7, 20, 968624) consider that it called for considerable self denia1 on their part to give up anything of the sharahbeshi which they had already obtained, but he appealed to them to think of the raiyats position; he would be prepared to accept a proposal on the basis of an all round reduction in the sharahbeshi already taken which was perhaps a better basis
('15', 492, 8, 21, 968968) for discussion.
('15', 492, 8, 22, 968984) He pointed out how desirable it was that some figure should be agreed upon between the parties because, in the event of this not being done either of the ways suggested, the only course remaining was the settlement of rents by a special tribunal which would give rise to endless quarrels, and would postpone settlement of the disputes over a considerable period.
('15', 492, 8, 23, 969347) If, however, the planters would prefer to have a special tribunal, he would be prepared to consider the proposal.
('15', 492, 8, 24, 969461) The President remarked that so far as the discussion had gone, the Committee favoured a settlement on the lines of proportionate reduction of sharahbeshi taken rather than the proposal
('15', 492, 9, 25, 969646) to an all round enhancement of a certain amount on the original rents, because the former was more equitable table in view of the varying conditions of different concerns.
('15', 492, 9, 26, 969818) Mr. Reid said he had a long talk that morning with the three planters present.
('15', 492, 9, 27, 969897) At first they had been averse from agreeing to any decrease to the
('15', 493, 0, 1, 969964) 494 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 493, 1, 2, 970006) enhancement which had been mutually agreed upon and approved by the Settlement Court.
('15', 493, 1, 3, 970092) Their view was that they had valuable property which the Committee was asking them to give up in part.
('15', 493, 1, 4, 970195) He had put the view to them that it was extremely desirable to avoid future litigation and t rouble even if it involved some sacrifice on their part.
('15', 493, 1, 5, 970345) Finally, they had agreed reluctantly to remit a certain proportion.
('15', 493, 1, 6, 970413) Mr. Hill, however, had pointed out that his enhancements were low and that he thought that the reduction in his case should be less than in that of others.
('15', 493, 1, 7, 970569) Mr. Gandhi said he was prepared to accept the principle of a different rate of reduction for different concerns but the difficulty was that the Committee had not got the figures before them and he doubted if the settlement records would give them sufficient data for arriving at a proper variation in the reduction without further enquiry.
('15', 493, 1, 8, 970909) The President said that the advantage of getting a settlement by agreement was immense not only to the planters but also to the raiyats .
('15', 493, 1, 9, 971047) If the Committee could decide on a particular percentage of
('15', 493, 2, 10, 971107) reduction, they would get a long way towards settlement and he, therefore, thought that an endeavour should be made to get down to a particular figure.
('15', 493, 2, 11, 971259) The alternative to a settlement by agreement was one which would lead to increased bitterness of feeling and even then the decisions of the special court might not be accepted with good will.
('15', 493, 2, 12, 971451) He would, therefore, ask the planters to state what was the outside figure of the reduction of the sharahbeshi enhancement to which they are prepared to agree.
('15', 493, 3, 13, 971611) Messrs Irwin and Norman said they were prepared to forego 25 per cent and Mr. Hill said he was repared to forego 20 per cent as a maximum.
('15', 493, 3, 14, 971750) Mr. Gandhi said that he was not in a position at present to say off hand what percentage of reduction he would consider to be fair and he was not sure whether the Committee were in a position to arrive at a figure at the present moment.
('15', 493, 3, 15, 971987) Mr. Gandhi wanted to know if the planters would agree to leave the percentage to be fixed by the Committee.
('15', 493, 3, 16, 972095) The planters explained their position to be that if the Committee recommended any deduction up to 25 per cent, they would accept it; if the Committee recommended a higher figure than 25 per cent, they would oppose it; and on the understanding that this would be binding on all with no possibility of litigation outside such agreement.
('15', 493, 3, 17, 972430) The President remarked that he thought that any agreement would require binding by legislation and that it now remained for the Committee to try and arrive at some agreement on the percentage.
('15', 493, 3, 18, 972623) He pointed out that in all these sharahbeshi cases, the
('15', 493, 4, 19, 972679) enhanced rents had been passed by the Settlement Courts as fair and equitable, so that the Committee could be quite certain that any rents fixed after such a reduction of sharahbeshi as was proposed would be a fortiori fair to the raiyats.
('15', 493, 4, 20, 972919) In disputed cases,
('15', 493, 5, 21, 972938) the rent had only been passed as fair and equitable by the Settlement Courts where they held that the tinkathia obligation was proved and the original rent was low.
('15', 493, 6, 22, 973103) thought, therefore, that there was no fear that the new rents after reduction would not be fair and equitable.
('15', 493, 6, 23, 973214) Mr. Gandhi observed that the Settlement Officer was, in his opinion, wrong in the decisions he gave and had misinterpreted the law.
('15', 493, 6, 24, 973346) He doubted
('15', 494, 0, 1, 973357) 495 VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917
('15', 494, 1, 2, 973399) whether the Settlement Courts decisions would stand legal scrutiny.
('15', 494, 1, 3, 973467) He also thought that the settlement decisions were wrong in equity and again referred to the judgment of the Special Judge in Special Appeal No.
('15', 494, 1, 4, 973612) 14 of 1916 in which the contention of the Settlement Officer that Re.
('15', 494, 1, 5, 973682) 0 4 8 per rupee was an unfair enhancement had been upheld by the Special Judge.
('15', 494, 1, 6, 973762) If the Settlement Courts had considered Re.
('15', 494, 1, 7, 973806) 0 4 8 to be an unfair enhancement and had allowed only 3 annas, how could they in other cases hold enhancements rising as high as l00 per cent to be fair and equitable?
('15', 494, 1, 8, 973975) Mr. Rainy thought that Mr. Gandhi was confusing a legal enhancement with a fair and equitable rent.
('15', 494, 1, 9, 974075) The applications of the Bettiah Raj for the settlement of their rent depended on the presumption that the existing rents were fair and equitable.
('15', 494, 1, 10, 974221) In the sharahbeshi cases, that presumption did not arise because the rents were specially
('15', 494, 2, 11, 974311) It was necessary to distinguish carefully the legal and equitable points of view.
('15', 494, 3, 12, 974393) Mr. Gandhi said that in determining what was a fair and equitable rent, the outturn of the soil alone should not be taken into consideration.
('15', 494, 3, 13, 974535) It did not follow because the rent was only a small proportion of the produce, that it was too low.
('15', 494, 3, 14, 974635) His difficulty was that his view point and that of the planters were different and there were no cases so difficult to settle by agreement as those in which the view point differed.
('15', 494, 3, 15, 974817) He could not agree to a penal enhancement and the proposal of a 25 per cent reduction at present appeared to him to involve a penal enhancement.
('15', 494, 3, 16, 974962) He wanted an opportunity to examine the figures before deciding.
('15', 494, 3, 17, 975027) Mr. Irwin instanced the case of Bisambharpur, a village belonging to petty maliks 1 and not in lease to him although entirely
('15', 494, 4, 18, 975153) surrounded by Bettiah Raj villages which he held in lease; the rates of rent in Biasambharpur varied from Rs. 9 to Rs. 14 a bigha, whereas the rate of rent in the surrounding villages in lease to him only averaged Rs. 4 to Rs. 5 a bigha, even including the sharahbeshi.
('15', 494, 4, 19, 975423) He did not see how it was possible to contend that from the raiyats standpoint, the proposal was a favourable one, as it would give them a
('15', 494, 5, 20, 975562) considerable advantage.
('15', 494, 5, 21, 975586) Mr. Gandhi, however, said that the legal position from the raiyats stand point was not hopeless.
('15', 494, 7, 22, 975683) Mr. Gandhi said that he worked out the figures as follows:
('15', 494, 8, 23, 975742) The sharahbeshi enhancement varied from 19 or 20 annas up to 30 or 32 annas per bigha.
('15', 494, 8, 24, 975829) A 25 per cent reduction would reduce these enhancements to amounts
('15', 494, 9, 25, 975896) varying from 14 annas 9 pies or 15 annas to 22 annas 6 pies or 24 annas.
('15', 494, 9, 26, 975969) According to his calculation, if the rent rate was Rs. 2 6 0 per bigha, the enhancement under his proposal would be 10 annas per bigha only and the difference between this and the
('15', 494, 10, 27, 976149) results of the other proposal was very considerable.
('15', 494, 10, 28, 976202) The President said that in
('15', 494, 11, 29, 976229) 1 Owners or proprietors
('15', 495, 0, 1, 976253) 496 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 495, 1, 2, 976295) Motihari, the sharahbeshi was 60 per cent of the former rent.
('15', 495, 1, 3, 976357) It was now proposed to
('15', 495, 2, 4, 976380) reduce it to 47 per cent, whereas Mr. Gandhis proposal would give only 25 per cent; the difference was, therefore, one of 20 per cent.
('15', 495, 2, 5, 976515) Mr. Rainy pointed out that it was misleading in some cases to judge by percentage because in cases where the percentage was high, e.g., Pipra, the absolute amount of the rent was low.
('15', 495, 2, 6, 976699) The President pointed out that both in Turkaulia and Motihari the raiyats had paid
('15', 495, 3, 7, 976782) enhanced rents for 6 years with no objections, save in a very few cases, and he thought that a reduction of 25 per cent was a very considerable concession to the raiyats.
('15', 495, 3, 8, 976953) Mr. Gandhi said that he looked at it from the point of view of what the raiyats had the right to demand 6 years ago, because it was only through their
('15', 495, 4, 9, 977104) ignorance of their legal position that they had not raised any objections before.
('15', 495, 4, 10, 977186) The President said that he saw no other way of avoiding a tribunal except settlement by consent, and it was very uncertain whether the raiyats would get such good terms from
('15', 495, 5, 11, 977360) the tribunal as those now offered.
('15', 495, 5, 12, 977395) Even if Mr. Gandhi was not satisfied that the present rent including sharahbeshi reduced as proposal was fair and equitable, could
('15', 495, 6, 13, 977526) he not be satisfied that rent was capable of being easily paid?
('15', 495, 6, 14, 977590) Mr. Gandhi said that he thought the Champaran raiyat was poor and he was not prepared to admit that the rent could be paid easily.
('15', 495, 6, 15, 977721) Mr. Gandhi said that the class of raiyats had to be considered as well as the possibilities of the soil and the Champaran raiyat was by nature a bad
('15', 495, 7, 16, 977870) cultivator.
('15', 495, 7, 17, 977882) In his opinion, if rents were apparently low, there was generally a very good reason for it.
('15', 495, 7, 18, 977975) He considered that the raiyats had fully paid for this concession of
('15', 495, 8, 19, 978044) abstention from rent enhancement and his view of the legal position was that the raiyats could free themselves from the obligation without paying any compensation.
('15', 495, 9, 20, 978208) In saying this, he did not mean to imply that he wished indigo to disappear; he would advise the raiyats to grow indigo, provided they got reasonable rates for it.
('15', 495, 10, 21, 978372) Rainy said on the basis of Mr. Sweeneys figures of produce the Pipra rents were very low, the Motihari rents moderate and even the Turkaulia rents were not high; if 25 per cent of the sharahbeshi, was taken off, it would give an ample margin of safety.
('15', 495, 11, 22, 978625) Gandhi said he could not bring himself to accept the proposal of a 25 per cent reduction.
('15', 495, 11, 23, 978715) Mr. Reid inquired whether the alternative to a settlement by agreement was the suggestion of a tribunal.
('15', 495, 11, 24, 978820) Mr. Gandhi said that if the Committee could not come to an agreement, he would be prepared to accept the suggestion of a tribunal, but he asked whether the Committee could not recommend a higher reduction.
('15', 495, 11, 25, 979026) The President said that he thought the Committee had got the highest possible figures out of the planters and he was not prepared to agree to higher figure.
('15', 495, 11, 26, 979183) He could not imagine that any raiyats would ever regret having accepted this proposal; the only raiyats who might be discontented were the few raiyats who still grew indigo.
('15', 495, 11, 27, 979357) Mr. Gandhi said that the raiyats thought that they could get rid of sharahbeshi by legal methods even
('15', 495, 12, 28, 979459) in cases where it had been settled under section 10 (C).
('15', 495, 12, 29, 979516) He did not see, therefore, that they would regret not accepting the present proposal.
('15', 496, 0, 1, 979602) 497 VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917
('15', 496, 1, 2, 979644) Mr. Gandhi enquired what was to be done in the case of the Jalaha concern in the event of the Committee reaching a conclusion on the general question.
('15', 496, 1, 3, 979795) In that concern, sharahbeshi had been taken by making tenants surrender their holdings
('15', 496, 2, 4, 979882) which were then resettled with their relatives on an enhanced rent.
('15', 496, 2, 5, 979950) The Civil Court had held in some cases that the old tenants should be restored at the former rent.
('15', 496, 2, 6, 980049) The President said that this was the first occasion that the matter had been brought to his notice and he thought that they ought to ascertain the facts and hear what Mr. Jameson had to say before coming to any conclusion about it.
('15', 496, 3, 7, 980281) Returning to the general question, Mr. Adami said that the equity of the
('15', 496, 4, 8, 980354) position would be to wash out the past 50 years and put the parties back in the
('15', 496, 5, 9, 980434) position they would have been if indigo had not been grown.
('15', 496, 5, 10, 980494) Mr. Gandhi said that this could not be done as the raiyat had given up far more than he had gained during
('15', 496, 6, 11, 980600) that period.
('15', 496, 6, 12, 980613) Mr. Rainy pointed out the high rents in Madhuban Babus estate.
('15', 496, 6, 13, 980676) Mr. Gandhi admitted that Indian zamindars had enhanced their raiyats rents.
('15', 496, 7, 14, 980752) President then said that as Mr. Gandhi could not agree to the 25 per cent reduction,
('15', 496, 8, 15, 980837) there were two courses openthe Committee could recommend the view of the
('15', 496, 9, 16, 980910) majority that a 25 per cent reduction was fair; Mr. Gandhi would in a note of dissent
('15', 496, 10, 17, 980996) give his reasons for thinking that a higher figure was required and it could be left to
('15', 496, 11, 18, 981084) Government to decide between these two views and legislate accordingly.
('15', 496, 12, 19, 981156) course, however, could only be adopted if he was satisfied that the decision of
('15', 496, 13, 20, 981236) Government whatever it might be would be accepted.
('15', 496, 13, 21, 981287) If it was not accepted, the
('15', 496, 14, 22, 981315) position of strife and unrest would still remain and in that event the Committee would
('15', 496, 15, 23, 981402) have to recommend the alternative procedure of settlement of rents by a special
('15', 496, 16, 24, 981482) tribunal.
('15', 496, 16, 25, 981492) He hoped that in the interest of peace, it would be possible to adopt the first
('15', 496, 17, 26, 981572) alternative, it being understood that whatever Government decided would be loyally
('15', 496, 18, 27, 981655) accepted.
('15', 496, 18, 28, 981665) Mr. Gandhi said that he could promise to accept the decision of Government and would refrain from advising the raiyats to resist it.
('15', 496, 18, 29, 981798) Mr. Reid enquired what should
('15', 496, 19, 30, 981828) be done as regards pending legislation.
('15', 496, 19, 31, 981868) Mr. Gandhi said that he thought it desirable to
('15', 496, 20, 32, 981916) forward their recommendation to Government at once, so that a decision might be
('15', 496, 21, 33, 981996) reached and pending legislation stopped as soon as possible.
('15', 496, 21, 34, 982057) Mr. Adami pointed out
('15', 496, 22, 35, 982079) that the legislation would take time and the President added that Government would
('15', 496, 23, 36, 982162) probably decide first to publish the Committees report and give time to the public
('15', 496, 24, 37, 982245) and the parties to consider the proposals.
('15', 496, 24, 38, 982288) It would facilitate the preparation of the
('15', 496, 25, 39, 982331) report and possibly I ncrease the chance of Government being able to arrive at a
('15', 496, 26, 40, 982412) decision if Mr. Gandhi could put before the Committee the reduction to which he was
('15', 496, 27, 41, 982496) prepared to go.
('15', 496, 27, 42, 982512) Mr. Gandhi said that he would go through the figures again and give
('15', 496, 28, 43, 982580) his minimum figure.

('15', 497, 5, 5, 982740) BETTIAH, August 12, 1917
('15', 497, 6, 6, 982765) MY DEAR ESTHER,
('15', 497, 7, 7, 982781) I have a moment to spare today.
('15', 497, 7, 8, 982813) The lines you send are good and true.
('15', 497, 7, 9, 982851) Belief and hope are great.
('15', 497, 7, 10, 982878) They are indispensable for success.
('15', 497, 7, 11, 982914) But love is greater.
('15', 497, 7, 12, 982935) I find here that too great a strain is put upon it.
('15', 497, 7, 13, 982987) Only this morning a powerfully built man came to me and insisted on my giving him help which was not in my power to give him.
('15', 497, 7, 14, 983113) He would not leave me.
('15', 497, 7, 15, 983136) I begged of him.
('15', 497, 7, 16, 983153) He began weeping and beating his breast.
('15', 497, 7, 17, 983194) His case is nothing.
('15', 497, 7, 18, 983215) He came out of hope and love.
('15', 497, 7, 19, 983245) How would I, wanting to love him, treat him?
('15', 497, 7, 20, 983290) Assuming that his weeping was sincere, must I put up with his presence and go on talking to him?
('15', 497, 7, 21, 983387) Such problems arise every day.
('15', 497, 7, 22, 983418) Love has to be patient.
('15', 497, 7, 23, 983442) How to apply the injunction in cases such as I have quoted?
('15', 497, 7, 24, 983502) The only safe guide is the monitor within if one is pure minded and sure of ones sincerity.
('15', 497, 7, 25, 983594) We often deceive ourselves.
('15', 497, 8, 26, 983622) You may write for the time being to Ahmedabad which I expect to reach within a week from now.
('15', 497, 8, 27, 983716) The Committee will have finished its deliberations within 3 days from today.
('15', 497, 9, 28, 983793) What treatment did you receive when you had the snake bite?
('15', 497, 9, 29, 983853) How did you manage to get bitten?
('15', 497, 9, 30, 983887) Where did it bite you?
('15', 497, 9, 31, 983910) Was the snake caught and killed?
('15', 497, 9, 32, 983943) I am always interested in the question of snake bites and snakes.
('15', 497, 10, 33, 984009) With love from us all,

('15', 498, 3, 4, 984170) DEAR SHANKERLAL, 1 have your letter.
('15', 498, 3, 5, 984207) The work of the Committee is likely to be completed in two or three days.
('15', 498, 3, 6, 984281) 2 After that I shall pay a short visit to Ahmedabad.
('15', 498, 3, 7, 984334) Perhaps we can meet then.
('15', 498, 3, 8, 984360) It is true that you have not been able to come here because of pressure of work.
('15', 498, 3, 9, 984441) You are carrying on a great campaign.
('15', 498, 3, 10, 984479) Bear in mind that even if thousands of people have to go to jail there may not be any tangible gain.
('15', 498, 3, 11, 984580) I am giving this warning so that in future you do not lose patience and faith.
('15', 498, 3, 12, 984659) Bhai Chandulal must have received my letter of yesterday.

('15', 498, 9, 18, 984843) MY DEAR HENRY, Here are two letters, I cannot think of anyone else.
('15', 498, 9, 19, 984911) If you do please tell me.
('15', 498, 9, 20, 984937) You will use the letters as you please.
('15', 498, 9, 21, 984977) I am in the thick of committee 3 work.
('15', 498, 9, 22, 985016) I cannot therefore send you a love letter.
('15', 498, 9, 23, 985059) That shall be reserved for Millie and she will need it in your absence.
('15', 498, 9, 24, 985131) Of course she knows that she has more slaves than one to be at her service.
('15', 498, 9, 25, 985207) Yes, I will send you duplicates.
('15', 498, 9, 26, 985240) I may be able to leave for Ahmedabad during the next 4 or 5 days.
('15', 498, 9, 27, 985306) With love,

('15', 499, 4, 6, 985726) BETTIAH, August 13, 1917
('15', 499, 5, 7, 985751) DEAR MR. SLY, I have thought, slept, prayed and read 1 Cor.
('15', 499, 5, 8, 985811) XIII which latter I always do before coming to the committee meetings.
('15', 499, 5, 9, 985882) I have discussed the question with my friends too.
('15', 499, 5, 10, 985933) I was surprised to find in Babu Brajkishore the strongest supporter of Mr. Rainys energetic defence of the fairness of the enhancement so far as it is measured by the outturn.
('15', 499, 5, 11, 986109) All the others resisted him.
('15', 499, 5, 12, 986138) Babu Brajkishore to my astonishment held his ground and said that on the score of lowness of rent he was entirely at one with Mr. Sweeneys finding.
('15', 499, 5, 13, 986286) His argument however is totally unconvincing.
('15', 499, 5, 14, 986332) But all my friends held that I would sell the raiyats cause, if I agreed to the planters proposition.
('15', 499, 5, 15, 986434) They unanimously appreciated the fact that the planters who are so strong in every way had at all accepted the idea of a reduction of sharahbeshi.
('15', 499, 5, 16, 986581) The majority of them would have me to buy peace from the committee even though it may mean a big sacrifice.
('15', 499, 5, 17, 986689) I thought that I ought to mention these pleasing incidents.
('15', 499, 5, 18, 986749) They augur well for the future.
('15', 499, 5, 19, 986781) My friends who represent, as I hold, the culture of Bihar are not fanatics as planter friends have so often urged.
('15', 499, 5, 20, 986896) There is no greater fanatic among us than myself.
('15', 499, 5, 21, 986946) Now for my offer which is absolutely final.
('15', 499, 5, 22, 986990) My last state was to accept the Raja Sahebs proposition 1. That reduced to percentage represents a reduction of 55 per cent as against the planters 25 per cent.
('15', 499, 5, 23, 987151) And if I am to write a dissenting minute, I should write in defence of that offer with the clearest conscience.
('15', 499, 5, 24, 987263) For the sake of securing unanimity among ourselves, I am prepared to accept a reduction of 40 per cent only, i.e., 15 per cent more than the planters
('15', 499, 6, 25, 987413) 1 Raja Kirtyanand Sinhas proposal circulated to members, Select Document No.

('15', 500, 1, 2, 987552) For me this borders, in my language, upon the penal.
('15', 500, 1, 3, 987605) Under the planters offer, they get Re.
('15', 500, 1, 4, 987644) 0 6 7 per rupee, under mine Re.
('15', 500, 1, 5, 987676) 0 5 3 per rupee.
('15', 500, 1, 6, 987693) My final offer therefore covers all possibilities, the possibility even of Mr. Whittys 1 appeal succeeding.
('15', 500, 1, 7, 987801) My own original offer was a rise of Re.
('15', 500, 1, 8, 987841) 0 3 0 in the rupee.
('15', 500, 1, 9, 987861) That is equivalent to a reduction of 66 per cent.
('15', 500, 1, 10, 987911) My present offer represents a reduction of 40 per cent.
('15', 500, 1, 11, 987967) I have therefore put up 26 per cent.
('15', 500, 1, 12, 988004) If then pressure is now to be applied, it must be not to me but to the planters.
('15', 500, 1, 13, 988085) Mr. Irwin has without the slightest justification taken large sums in tawan and has collected sharahbeshi for the past 6 years.
('15', 500, 1, 14, 988213) He can have little to grumble about if he accepts my offer.
('15', 500, 1, 15, 988273) For both Turkaulia and Peeprah, there is evidence before the committee of sufficient pressure exerted upon the raiyats to vitiate sharahbeshi.
('15', 500, 1, 16, 988416) We have it on record that Mr. Sweeney in coming to his decision on coercion had not read the judgment in Lomraj Singhs case nor had he the full Bench decision before him on undue influence.
('15', 500, 1, 17, 988606) It is settled law now that there is no distinction between undue influence and coercion.
('15', 500, 1, 18, 988695) I just mention these facts to show that we as a committee dare not ignore them.
('15', 500, 1, 19, 988775) It is not possible to base our decision merely on the theoretical ground of the so called lowness of rent.
('15', 500, 1, 20, 988882) I am sure the committee will think a hundred times before putting on the Government the strain of arbitrating upon a figure dispute between its members.
('15', 500, 1, 21, 989035) I have gone to the furthest limit in order to avoid any such calamity.
('15', 500, 1, 22, 989106) If you and the other members cannot find it in your conscience to accept my approach, I shall sorrowfully write my minute of dissent but it will be, as I have said, in support of 55 per cent reduction.
('15', 500, 1, 23, 989308) 40 per cent reduction is for the consideration of the members (and the planters only, if, in your opinion, they should be consulted again).
('15', 500, 2, 24, 989448) Yours sincerely,
('15', 500, 3, 25, 989465) M. K. GANDHI I have omitted decimals in my figures.

('15', 501, 2, 3, 989814) August 14, 1917
('15', 501, 3, 4, 989830) The President said that a letter 1 received from Mr. Gandhi stated that a compromise on the basis of a reduction of 25 per cent was outside the possibility of his acceptance.
('15', 501, 3, 5, 990005) Mr. Gandhi further wrote that provided he obtained the unanimous consent of the Committee, he would agree to a 40 per cent reduction, but if that was not accepted, he would in a note of dissent recommend a reduction of 55 per cent.
('15', 501, 3, 6, 990237) The President put this proposal to the meeting.
('15', 501, 3, 7, 990285) Mr. Reid said that he could not recommend the planters to give up more than 25 per cent and it would be useless for him to go to them again.
('15', 501, 3, 8, 990426) In particular, he referred to the case of Mr. Hill where the reduction of 25 per cent would bring his rents down to little more than he could have got from the ordinary enhancement on the ground of rise in prices.
('15', 501, 3, 9, 990640) Mr. Gandhi said that he would always be prepared to recognise the principle of a different reduction in different concerns.
('15', 501, 3, 10, 990764) The President, however, pointed out that it was clear that the proposal for a settlement by compromise had failed.
('15', 501, 3, 11, 990879) He assumed that Mr. Gandhi would now write a minute of dissent advocating a 55 per cent reduction.
('15', 501, 3, 12, 990978) He did not wish to press him for further concessions, but asked him to consider one point.
('15', 501, 3, 13, 991069) Both parties were anxious not to have a special tribunal or to have matters settled by the ordinary courts.
('15', 501, 3, 14, 991177) If the report went up with the recommendation in its present form, Government would have to arbitrate between a reduction of 25 per cent and one of 55 per cent, and he was very doubtful if Government would consent to arbitrate between such wide limits, though they might possibly be inclined to arbitrate between the narrower limits of 25 per cent and 40 per cent.
('15', 501, 3, 15, 991542) He, therefore, asked Mr. Gandhi if it would not be possible in his minute of dissent to put his figure at 40 per cent.
('15', 501, 3, 16, 991661) Mr. Gandhi said he did not see why Government should refuse to arbitrate if the limits were wide.
('15', 501, 3, 17, 991759) The President then made another suggestion that if he approached Government on the subject of arbitration on the basis that Mr. Gandhi stated in his minute of dissent his willingness to abide by the decision of Government, he asked whether Mr. Gandhi would object to his telling Government that an offer of compromise at 40 per cent had been made from his side.
('15', 501, 3, 18, 992121) Mr. Gandhi said he was willing to let Government know all the facts including the fact that he had offered to compromise at 40 per cent but was not prepared to agree that the limits for arbitration should be any other than between 25 per cent and 55 per cent.
('15', 501, 3, 19, 992381) Mr. Reid pointed out that the planters offer of 25 per cent was final and it should be put in on the same basis as Mr. Gandhis final offer of 40 per cent.
('15', 501, 3, 20, 992536) Mr. Gandhi said that he was willing for Government to arbitrate between the extreme limits of no reduction at all and a 100 per cent reduction and also that they should know that the planters were prepared to go as far as 25 per cent and that he was
('15', 501, 4, 21, 992786) 1 Vide the preceding item.
('15', 502, 0, 1, 992813) 503 VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917
('15', 502, 1, 2, 992855) prepared to go as far as 40 per cent.
('15', 502, 1, 3, 992893) He was also prepared to state this in his minute of dissent in order to show how reasonable he had been.
('15', 502, 1, 4, 992998) The President then said that he had a final proposal to put forward.
('15', 502, 1, 5, 993067) He knew that Mr. Gandhi was aware of his personal view that the raiyats would be well advised to accept 25 per cent.
('15', 502, 1, 6, 993184) He had gone through Mr. Gandhis views and had done his best to realise the raiyats
('15', 502, 2, 7, 993267) position.
('15', 502, 2, 8, 993277) He was personally unwilling to put forward any proposal for arbitration by Government, because the Committee would thus have failed in its full task and because the Government could hardly be in a better position to arbitrate than the Committee.
('15', 502, 2, 9, 993523) As Mr. Gandhi was willing to allow Government to arbitrate, he asked if he would have sufficient trust in him to leave the arbitration in his hands, subject to three conditions:
('15', 502, 3, 10, 993701) (1) That in no case would he arbitrate at a figure lower than the mean between 25 per cent and 40 per cent,
('15', 502, 4, 11, 993809) (2) He would endeavour to secure the consent of the planters to the figure which he fixed, and
('15', 502, 5, 12, 993904) (3) He would endeavour to secure the unanimous consent of the Committee.
('15', 502, 6, 13, 993977) Mr. Gandhi agreed that the Committee should bear the burden itself, if possible.
('15', 502, 6, 14, 994058) He doubted whether it was possible for the President at this stage to bring a fresh mind to bear on the situation, particularly after the President had advocated enhancement of rent in lieu of abwab which was diametrically opposed to his views.
('15', 502, 7, 15, 994303) The President said that he could only arbitrate between the limits of 25 per cent and 40 per cent and, as a matter of fact, had already practically fixed a figure.
('15', 502, 7, 16, 994467) Mr. Gandhi said that in that case, as the President had made up his mind, he could not agree as there was no hope of his being able to convince the President of the justice of the raiyats case.
('15', 502, 7, 17, 994661) The President then said that as the offer had not been accepted, he now
('15', 502, 8, 18, 994733) wished to put before the Committee another proposal.
('15', 502, 8, 19, 994786) The utmost limit to which the planters would agree was 25 per cent.
('15', 502, 8, 20, 994854) The utmost limit to which Mr. Gandhi would agree on behalf of the raiyats was 40 per cent.
('15', 502, 8, 21, 994945) There was a difference of 15 per cent.
('15', 502, 9, 22, 994984) In thinking out a possible means of bridging this chasm, a solution had occurred to him while considering Mr. Gandhis arguments.
('15', 502, 9, 23, 995113) Mr. Irwin had, in the course of the discussion on the 12th of August, stated that his mukarrari leases were unprofitable
('15', 502, 10, 24, 995234) on the old rental and Mr. Gandhis reply to this was that the planters should have squeezed the Bettiah Raj and not the raiyats.
('15', 502, 10, 25, 995362) The lines, therefore, on which he had
('15', 502, 11, 26, 995400) thought of a solution were that the Committee should recommend a reduction in sharahbeshi approximating to 40 per cent, of which the planters would be
('15', 502, 12, 27, 995551) responsible for 25 per cent and the Bettiah Raj would bear the balance until the next settlement.
('15', 502, 12, 28, 995649) He proposed a limitation of period as regards the contribution of the Bettiah Estate by analogy with the case of tawan, in which it had been decided that the
('15', 502, 13, 29, 995807) Raj should forego enhanced rents for a certain period.
('15', 502, 13, 30, 995862) Mr. Gandhi said that the
('15', 503, 0, 1, 995887) 504 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 503, 1, 2, 995929) proposal was attractive in theory but he would want a strong evidence that the mukarrari leases were not a paying proposition before he could agree.
('15', 503, 1, 3, 996078) The President
('15', 503, 2, 4, 996092) pointed out that Mr. Whitty had told him that on the whole the profit on the mukarrari leases was very small.
('15', 503, 2, 5, 996202) At the time they were given the jama was fixed at
('15', 503, 3, 6, 996252) the full rental or in excess thereof and the increase of rent since that time had been small.
('15', 503, 3, 7, 996346) Mr. Gandhi thought that they could state in the report that one planter had given evidence that the mukarrari leases without indigo involved a loss and that if
('15', 503, 4, 8, 996506) this was proved to the satisfaction of the Court of Wards to be generally the case, the Committee recommended that the Bettiah Estate should bear part of the burden.
('15', 503, 4, 9, 996672) He did not think that on the evidence before him they could definitely make a proposal of this nature because hitherto all the enquiries had been directed towards the relations between the planters and the raiyats without considering the position of the Bettiah
('15', 503, 5, 10, 996934) Estate.
('15', 503, 5, 11, 996942) The President said that his proposition was that whatever balance there was between 25 per cent and the figure agreed upon should be borne by the Raj.
('15', 503, 5, 12, 997093) This would be done by the Raj reducing their mukarrari rental by this figure for a period of years.
('15', 503, 6, 13, 997193) He had satisfied himself that the proposal was equitable, as far as the Estate was concerned.
('15', 503, 6, 14, 997287) The mukarrari jama received by the Bettiah Estate was high owing to the
('15', 503, 7, 15, 997359) indigo industry; the Estate had, therefore, profited by the industry and, if the obligation of indigo growing had to be commuted, it was fair that a portion of this should be borne by the Estate.
('15', 503, 7, 16, 997555) Moreover, if there was no settlement of the present dispute by agreement, the Estate might find it hard to realise their jamas owing to the
('15', 503, 8, 17, 997695) difficulties of the planters and further from the point of view of a good landlord, the Estate should contribute towards the settlement of the dispute.
('15', 503, 8, 18, 997847) As the Estate was now getting an enhancement of rents in its kham and thika villages, its finances would be well able to bear this extra payment.
('15', 503, 8, 19, 997993) The actual amount of sharahbeshi, so far as it
('15', 503, 9, 20, 998040) could be ascertained, was about Rs. 1_ lakhs, 15 per cent of which was Rs. 22,500, this being the maximum amount which the Estate would have to forego annually if the full reduction of 40 per cent was fixed.
('15', 503, 9, 21, 998248) He did not think that it was just that the Raj should forego it in perpetuity and for that reason he limited it to a period extending up to the next settlement 15 or 20 years hence.
('15', 503, 9, 22, 998430) Mr. Gandhi said that before agreeing he would have to satisfy himself that the Estate had not profited by indigo and he would like to know the circumstances under which the leases had originally been given.
('15', 503, 9, 23, 998637) The President thought that the Estate could equitably bear part of the burden whether the leases had been favourable or not because but for indigo the Estate would not have secured such high jamas.
('15', 503, 9, 24, 998835) Mr. Reid pointed out that in addition to the high jama, very large nazarana had been paid at the time the leases were given.
('15', 503, 9, 25, 998960) Mr. Gandhi observed
('15', 503, 10, 26, 998980) that the taking of the leases was a commercial bargain and, if owing to present circumstances the bargain turned out unprofitable, that was no reason why the Bettiah Raj should suffer now.
('15', 503, 10, 27, 999169) The President said that it was just because it was a commercial bargain that the Bettiah Estate should now bear a part of the burden of giving up the
('15', 504, 0, 1, 999319) 505 VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917
('15', 504, 1, 2, 999361) obligation on which the bargain was based.
('15', 504, 1, 3, 999404) Mr. Gandhi replied that the Bettiah Raj and the planters were the only parties to the bargain and he asked why the Raj should pay because accidents had happened.
('15', 504, 1, 4, 999566) The material before the Committee was he thought, too small to come to a conclusion.
('15', 504, 1, 5, 999651) The President said that the only additional evidence that was required as far as he could see was information as to the rental paid in each village and a comparison of that with the mukkarrari jama.
('15', 504, 2, 6, 999850) Gandhi said that if the planters were going to get the same amount of indigo on the khuski system by paying a fair rate he did not see that any loss would accrue to them
('15', 504, 3, 7, 1000020) from the commutation.
('15', 504, 3, 8, 1000042) Mr. Adami pointed out that if a struggle went on between the planters and the raiyats, the Bettiah Estate would inevitably lose money by it and it
('15', 504, 4, 9, 1000189) was therefore to the interests of the Estate to make some sacrifice in order to bring about a settlement.
('15', 504, 4, 10, 1000295) Mr. Gandhi replied that these were considerations outside the main point of the equity of making the Raj pay but he was willing to embody in the report a statement of the planters case against the Bettiah Raj but he did not think that the Committee were called upon to decide that case.
('15', 504, 4, 11, 1000582) Mr. Adami said he thought they might state the outside limit to which the two parties would go namely, 25 per cent and 40 per cent.
('15', 504, 4, 12, 1000714) After stating the case for the planters against the Estate he suggested that the Estate should pay the difference if Government found the case to be proved.
('15', 504, 4, 13, 1000871) The President asked if the Committee could not go further and find that it was proved.
('15', 504, 4, 14, 1000958) Mr. Gandhi doubted whether they could get sufficient information as to the mukarrari leases.
('15', 504, 4, 15, 1001051) The President pointed out that the information from the
('15', 504, 5, 16, 1001107) Government records was that the Maharaja himself gave the leases in order to get security for the sterling loan.
('15', 504, 6, 17, 1001220) Mr. Gandhi said that he looked at the matter purely as a commercial transaction and could not see why the Bettiah Raj should pay anything because the transaction had become unprofitable to the planters.
('15', 504, 6, 18, 1001423) He thought that by friendly relations and good will in the district there was a future for indigo.
('15', 504, 6, 19, 1001522) Mr. Reid observed that after the next settlement, the planters would be bearing the full burden.
('15', 504, 6, 20, 1001619) Mr. Gandhi pointed out that they would get the usual enhancement at that time on the ground of rise in prices but the President observed that the planters would never get back the 25 per cent which they were now giving up.
('15', 504, 6, 21, 1001842) Mr. Rainy said that, under
('15', 504, 7, 22, 1001869) 1 Some indigo planters secured permanent leases from the Bettiah Raj in 1888, taking advantage of the latters necessity to obtain a loan of 475,000 which was floated in England on the security of the indigo planters.
('15', 504, 7, 23, 1002086) The loan was negotiated through a Calcutta firm with the help of another in London and was within the knowledge of the Government of India and the Lt. Governor of Bengal.
('15', 504, 7, 24, 1002257) A condition attached to the loan was that the Maharaja of Bettiah could appoint a successor to T. M. Gibbon, the then Manager of the Raj and an ex planter, only with the approval of the Lt. Governor of Bengal.

('15', 505, 0, 1, 1002534) 506 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 505, 1, 2, 1002576) the provisions of the Bengal Tenancy Act, once the landlord had foregone his rent enhancement, he could never recover it.
('15', 505, 1, 3, 1002698) Mr. Gandhi remarked that Indian thikadars
('15', 505, 2, 4, 1002740) were able to drive a coach and four through the Bengal Tenancy Act; although the big estates could not do this, the small estates found it easy to get their tenants to pay enhanced rents.
('15', 505, 2, 5, 1002928) Mr. Reid said that he had no objection to accept the proposal if Mr. Gandhi agreed to it, though he considered it hard on the planters.
('15', 505, 2, 6, 1003064) Mr. Rainy said that he agreed with Mr. Gandhi that it was necessary for the Committee to be sure of its ground.
('15', 505, 2, 7, 1003176) He would not have hesitated to suggest the proposal to the Raj with a view to promoting a settlement of the dispute if there had been a Maharaja but, as Government was trustee for the management of the Estate, it was necessary to consider the proposal carefully before suggesting it.
('15', 505, 2, 8, 1003460) He did not think that the Estate could divest itself of responsibility for the present position.
('15', 505, 2, 9, 1003557) The President asked if it would not be sufficient if the Committee examined the correspondence regarding the mukarrari leases and considered the mukarrari jama and the rentals of the villages
('15', 505, 3, 10, 1003749) both at the time when the leases were granted and at present.
('15', 505, 3, 11, 1003811) Mr. Gandhi thought that this would not be sufficient as the Court of Wards would want to know if there was going to be a loss to the planters in future; that the Committee was now bringing in a third party and was bound to consider that partys position.
('15', 505, 3, 12, 1004065) Mr. Reid asked why they could not leave it to Government; but the President pointed out that if possible the Committee ought to decide for themselves.
('15', 505, 3, 13, 1004216) He said that if this proposal was not accepted, there was no alternative but to recommend a special tribunal or to leave the decision of cases to the ordinary Court.
('15', 505, 3, 14, 1004382) If there had been only one dissent to the proposal about Government arbitration, it might have been possible to leave it to Government but Raja Kirtyanand Sinhas dissent made arbitration impossible.
('15', 505, 3, 15, 1004581) He thought the planters stood to lose by this course and that the raiyats stood to lose
('15', 505, 4, 16, 1004669) even more.
('15', 505, 4, 17, 1004680) Mr. Adami said that it was clearly to the interests of the Raj to agree to the proposal which should be recommended to Government who would naturally consult the Board of Revenue before passing orders.
('15', 505, 4, 18, 1004882) He was prepared to accept the proposal.
('15', 505, 4, 19, 1004922) Raja Kirtyanand Sinha also said he was prepared to accept the proposal, though the ultimate orders of Government would depend on the view taken by the Court of Wards.
('15', 505, 4, 20, 1005089) Mr. Rainy agreed but that the Committee should try and convince Government that the proposal was a fair one.
('15', 505, 4, 21, 1005198) Mr. Gandhi said that even if he satisfied himself that the proposal was fair, he would not agree to let the Raj bear the loss for so long a period as 15 years.
('15', 505, 4, 22, 1005358) Mr. Reid pointed out that it was for Government to satisfy itself on the point.
('15', 505, 4, 23, 1005438) Mr. Gandhi said he thought he would be on dangerous ground if he accepted the proposal without knowing the facts, and even so he could not accept it without knowing what was going to happen in future.
('15', 505, 4, 24, 1005639) He thought that the Committee could not bind down the Raj to a prospective loss.
('15', 505, 4, 25, 1005720) He, therefore, put forward an alternative proposal.
('15', 505, 4, 26, 1005772) He said that the dispute was merely as to figures and that if the Committee had accepted his view, there would have been no need to bring the Bettiah Raj into
('15', 506, 0, 1, 1005931) 507 VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917
('15', 506, 1, 2, 1005973) consideration.
('15', 506, 1, 3, 1005988) He proposed that the planters on the one side and he on the other on behalf of raiyats should put their views to arbitration, not by Government, nor by the
('15', 506, 2, 4, 1006144) Committee but by a separate body.
('15', 506, 2, 5, 1006178) He proposed as arbitrators Mr. Apperley 1 and Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya who would select a third arbitrator as an umpire between them, or, if the Committee did not agree to that, he would suggest Mr. Heycock.
('15', 506, 2, 6, 1006389) Both parties would state their case to the arbitrators who would have before them also the views of the Committee.
('15', 506, 2, 7, 1006504) They would then give their decision which would be embodied in the Committees report.
('15', 506, 2, 8, 1006590) Mr. Reid said that he could not agree to this proposal.
('15', 506, 2, 9, 1006646) The planters had already gone to the full extent of their concession and he was sure that they would not agree to this suggestion of arbitration.
('15', 506, 2, 10, 1006792) Mr. Rainy also thought that the planters would not consent.
('15', 506, 2, 11, 1006852) With a 25 per cent reduction, the average enhancement in the Turkaulia concern would be 4 annas 10 pies; if the rates of permissible enhancement in the Sardar Sub division worked out at much the same as they had in the Bettiah Sub division, the Turkaulia concern could go to the Munsifs Court and get the enhancement at 4 annas 8 pies in the rupee; it was clear, therefore, that it would be no advantage to them to consent to an arbitration which would almost certainly involve a loss.
('15', 506, 2, 12, 1007338) The President said that in these circumstances the matter would have to be left in the position that his proposal regarding the Bettiah Raj was supported by the majority of the Committee, and Mr. Gandhi would not oppose it if Government satisfied itself that it was fair to the Bettiah Estate.
('15', 506, 2, 13, 1007632) Failing that, the alternative solution of a special tribunal would be recommended.
('15', 506, 3, 14, 1007715) The President then said there was one small point which he desired to bring to notice.
('15', 506, 3, 15, 1007802) Mr. Gandhi had all along agreed that raiyats should have their rents
('15', 506, 4, 16, 1007871) enhanced by the amount permissible on account of the rise in prices.
('15', 506, 4, 17, 1007940) There was a possibility of difficulty arising in the Rajghat concern owing to its forbearance.
('15', 506, 4, 18, 1008035) He asked therefore if Mr. Gandhi agreed to a special recommendation that in the Rajghat concern there should be an enhancement of rent on the ground of rise in prices and an increase of rent on the ground of excess area by the application of section 112, Bengal Tenancy Act.
('15', 506, 4, 19, 1008310) Mr. Gandhi agreed.
('15', 506, 5, 20, 1008329) Tawan: In connection with the question of tawan, Mr. Gandhi said that he had been looking up cases of tawan in recently leased villages and had made a list of the cases in which he thought indigo sattas had been taken merely for the purposes of releasing tawan and he suggested that in any case where tawan
('15', 506, 6, 21, 1008636) had been taken in villages where indigo had been grown for less than 10 years, the whole of the tawan should be refunded.
('15', 506, 6, 22, 1008758) The President asked if the Committee could not agree to a general recommendation that, if tawan had been imposed in a
('15', 506, 7, 23, 1008876) village within the last few years which had never grown indigo, the whole should be refunded Mr. Reid suggested that the decision of such cases should be left to the
('15', 506, 8, 24, 1009042) 1 Perhaps F. W. Apperley, Manager of Rajghat Concern
('15', 507, 0, 1, 1009095) 508 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 507, 1, 2, 1009137) Bettiah Raj.
('15', 507, 1, 3, 1009150) Mr. Rainy pointed out that the objectionable cases were those in which it was certain that sattas had been executed for the purpose of taking tawan and
('15', 507, 2, 4, 1009302) nothing else.
('15', 507, 2, 5, 1009316) It was unsafe to rely on dates in this matter and he could not agree to a fixed period of 10 years.
('15', 507, 2, 6, 1009416) He thought that it would be easy to find a form of words to which they could all agree and suggested that they should recommend that when it appeared to the Bettiah Estate that indigo sattas were taken with the object of taking tawan and not for growing indigo the Estate should insist on the whole of the tawan
('15', 507, 3, 7, 1009728) being refunded.
('15', 507, 3, 8, 1009744) The President suggested the addition that where the factory after growing indigo for one year proceeded to take tawan it should be presumed that the sattas were taken for the purposes of levying tawan and nothing else.
('15', 507, 3, 9, 1009963) This was
('15', 507, 4, 10, 1009972) agreed too.
('15', 507, 5, 11, 1009984) Thika Leases: Mr. Gandhi suggested that the Committee should recommend that thika leases should be for short periods only.
('15', 507, 5, 12, 1010107) The President said that in his experience short term leases were a very great temptation to the thikadars to fleece the raiyats.
('15', 507, 5, 13, 1010236) The policy in the Central Provinces had been to lengthen the leases but to
('15', 507, 6, 14, 1010311) impose strict conditions as to their cancellation and he thought that this policy was much wiser than that of short leases.
('15', 507, 6, 15, 1010435) Mr. Gandhi withdrew his suggestion.
('15', 507, 7, 16, 1010471) Special Tribunal: As regards the proposals for the special tribunal Mr. Gandhi
('15', 507, 8, 17, 1010550) suggested as an amendment that an appeal should be allowed to the High Court.
('15', 507, 8, 18, 1010628) Mr. Rainy thought that if any amendment was necessary it was in the other direction, his idea being that the tribunal should be composed of a senior Revenue Officer and a senior Judicial Officer and that there should be no appeal from their decision.
('15', 507, 8, 19, 1010879) What was wanted was finality, and several appeals would make matters little better than if they were left to be dealt with by the ordinary courts.
('15', 507, 8, 20, 1011026) Mr. Gandhi said that he would prefer a special court of three members if there was to be no appeal but would like to think the matter over.
('15', 507, 9, 21, 1011166) The Committee then adjourned.

('15', 507, 14, 26, 1011318) DEAR MR. NORMAN,
('15', 507, 15, 27, 1011335) Here are some statements from your raiyats.
('15', 507, 15, 28, 1011379) I have been sending some of such statements to the Collector.
('15', 507, 15, 29, 1011441) He however is loath to take executive action.
('15', 507, 15, 30, 1011487) From his standpoint he is right.
('15', 507, 15, 31, 1011520) I want to

('15', 508, 7, 11, 1012034) DEAR SHRI JAMNALAL, I have your letter.
('15', 508, 7, 12, 1012074) I have come here for a few days.
('15', 508, 7, 13, 1012107) There is no need for you to go to Champaran.

('15', 508, 12, 18, 1012329) August 24, 1917
('15', 508, 13, 19, 1012345) It would seem that what we have been fighting for was within our reach.
('15', 508, 13, 20, 1012417) The officials think that the lawyers and doctors in the country, having nothing else to do, go on talking endlessly and discussing political matters but this meeting proves them wrong.
('15', 508, 13, 21, 1012602) The Government has prohibited students [from attending political meetings], but that has not kept away all of them.
('15', 508, 13, 22, 1012718) 3 And now the business community is also realizing the importance of political
('15', 508, 14, 23, 1012797) 1 From the reference to Champaran, the letter appears to have been written in 1917. 2 The meeting was held under the auspices of the local Home Rule League to demand the release of Mrs. Besant and her co workers.
('15', 508, 14, 24, 1013010) Gandhiji was in the chair.
('15', 508, 14, 25, 1013037) 3 In May June 1917, the Madras, Bombay and Bengal Governments issued orders prohibiting student in schools and colleges from attending or taking part in political meetings.

('15', 509, 1, 3, 1013263) It is my view that, until the business community takes charge of all public movements in India, no good can be done to the country.
('15', 509, 1, 4, 1013395) British merchants have earned a name by fighting for their freedom.
('15', 509, 1, 5, 1013463) Ahmedabad is the capital of Gujarat and wields much influence.
('15', 509, 1, 6, 1013526) If business men elsewhere start taking livelier interest in political agitations, as you of Ahmedabad are doing, India is sure to achieve her aim.

('15', 509, 9, 14, 1013823) I still have two of your letters to answer.
('15', 509, 9, 15, 1013867) Do not give up the morning prayer.
('15', 509, 9, 16, 1013902) And I want you to remember Indian dates.
('15', 509, 9, 17, 1013943) I have to go to Champaran again.
('15', 509, 9, 18, 1013976) Take care of your health.
('15', 509, 9, 19, 1014002) You write nothing about it.
('15', 509, 9, 20, 1014030) You will have received my previous letters.
('15', 509, 9, 21, 1014074) It does not cause me pain that your thoughts are turning towards marriage.
('15', 509, 9, 22, 1014149) I shall certainly help to the extent I can if you will accept my choice.
('15', 509, 9, 23, 1014222) I am looking around for a girl.
('15', 509, 9, 24, 1014254) No money must be spent on marriage.
('15', 509, 9, 25, 1014290) There will be some little expenditure, but that hardly matters.
('15', 509, 9, 26, 1014354) One thing is certain.
('15', 509, 9, 27, 1014376) You must marry only after you have begun to earn.
('15', 509, 9, 28, 1014426) I do not think it will be difficult for you to find some means of livelihood.
('15', 509, 9, 29, 1014504) My advice is this: for the present you should with a steady mind continue to work for Indian Opinion.
('15', 509, 9, 30, 1014606) Make the position of the paper sound.
('15', 509, 9, 31, 1014644) Only when you find that it can carry on without you should you come away.
('15', 509, 9, 32, 1014718) If you can find independent means of livelihood there and can side by side work for Indian Opinion, there can be no objection to it.
('15', 509, 9, 33, 1014851) Consult Mr. West.
('15', 509, 9, 34, 1014869) See that your name is not disgraced.
('15', 509, 9, 35, 1014906) Whatever work you may choose to do it will not pain me so long as it does not degrade you.
('15', 509, 9, 36, 1014997) My happiness lies in your satisfaction.
('15', 509, 9, 37, 1015037) You may fearlessly pour out your feelings to me.

('15', 510, 1, 2, 1015128) Your criticism of .
('15', 510, 1, 3, 1015148) 1 appears to be mistaken.
('15', 510, 1, 4, 1015174) If he goes to what are (to him) innocent dances and if no expenditure is involved, there can be no harm.
('15', 510, 1, 5, 1015279) It is true that I do not easily believe bad things said about a person I have come to trust.
('15', 510, 1, 6, 1015372) It is a virtue, not a failing.
('15', 510, 1, 7, 1015403) Still, you must write to me whatever comes to your notice.
('15', 510, 1, 8, 1015462) Tell Miss Schlesin to write to me.
('15', 510, 1, 9, 1015497) I am awaiting her arrival.
('15', 510, 1, 10, 1015524) Tell her also that there are some ten letters from me she has not answered.
('15', 510, 1, 11, 1015600) Remember me to all the others.
('15', 510, 1, 12, 1015631) Visit Mr. Phillip and Mr. Doke.

('15', 510, 1, 14, 1015738) In that case write to them.

('15', 510, 7, 23, 1016090) August 31, 1917
('15', 510, 8, 24, 1016106) On the morning of 31st August, certain words of Bapuji created in me the mixed feelings of love, dismay and joy.
('15', 510, 8, 25, 1016219) I shall now try to pen in this letter my short talk with him on that day, although it cannot be easily put into words.
('15', 510, 8, 26, 1016338) Bapuji said: It is not without reason that I have asked you to visit my place every day.
('15', 510, 8, 27, 1016427) I want you to come and stay with me.
('15', 510, 8, 28, 1016464) I have seen your capacity during the last three days.
('15', 510, 8, 29, 1016518) I have found in you just the type of young man for whom I have been searching for the last two years.
('15', 510, 8, 30, 1016620) Will you believe me if I tell you that I have got in you the man I wantedthe man to whom I can entrust all my work some day and be at ease, and on whom I can rely with confidence?
('15', 510, 8, 31, 1016800) You have to come to me.
('15', 510, 8, 32, 1016824) Leave the Home Rule League, Shri Jamnadas and everything else.
('15', 510, 8, 33, 1016887) I have spoken like this only to three persons before this, Mr. Polak, Miss Schlesin and Shri Maganlal.

('15', 511, 1, 3, 1017186) They are regularity, fidelity and intelligence.
('15', 511, 1, 4, 1017234) When I first picked up Maganlal, to all appearances he had nothing special about him.
('15', 511, 1, 5, 1017320) But today you are surprised by his personality.
('15', 511, 1, 6, 1017368) He was not educated.
('15', 511, 1, 7, 1017389) I trained him first for press work.
('15', 511, 1, 8, 1017425) He learnt composing in Gujarati and then in English, Hindi, Tamil and other languages.
('15', 511, 1, 9, 1017512) I was surprised at the speed at which he mastered the art.
('15', 511, 1, 10, 1017571) Since then he has shown his skill in various kinds of work.
('15', 511, 1, 11, 1017631) Let us, however, leave aside Maganlal.
('15', 511, 1, 12, 1017670) The intelligence I have found in you I did not see in him.
('15', 511, 1, 13, 1017729) I am confident that you will be useful to me in various ways because of your good qualities.
('15', 511, 2, 14, 1017822) 1 listened to all this with surprise and shyness, without speaking a single word.
('15', 511, 2, 15, 1017904) I interrupted by saying, I have never shown you anything I have done, to which he answered as follows: How do you know?
('15', 511, 2, 16, 1018024) I can judge people in a very short time.
('15', 511, 2, 17, 1018065) I judged Polak within five hours.
('15', 511, 2, 18, 1018099) He read my letter published in a newspaper and wrote me a letter.
('15', 511, 2, 19, 1018165) He then came to see me and I at once saw what he was, and since then he became my man.
('15', 511, 2, 20, 1018252) He married and started his practice as a pleader only after he joined me.
('15', 511, 2, 21, 1018326) He told me before marriage that he must earn a little for his children.
('15', 511, 2, 22, 1018398) I told him plainly, You are mine and the responsibility to provide for you and your children is mine, not yours.
('15', 511, 2, 23, 1018511) I am getting you married, as I see no objection to your marrying. His marriage was celebrated at my residence.
('15', 511, 2, 24, 1018622) But to revert to the point under discussion.
('15', 511, 2, 25, 1018667) I advise you to give up all thought about the Home Rule League or Jamnadas.
('15', 511, 2, 26, 1018743) Go to Hyderabad.
('15', 511, 2, 27, 1018760) Enjoy yourself for a year or so.
('15', 511, 2, 28, 1018793) Enjoy the pleasures of life to your satisfaction.
('15', 511, 2, 29, 1018843) The moment you start feeling that you are losing yourself, resign from there and come and join me.
('15', 511, 3, 30, 1018942) At this I told him that I was prepared even then to join him.
('15', 511, 3, 31, 1019004) But he replied: I know that you are prepared but I want you to see a little more of life and enjoy yourself.
('15', 511, 3, 32, 1019113) I would need your knowledge of the Co operative Movement also.
('15', 511, 3, 33, 1019176) We have to free that department from its defects.
('15', 511, 3, 34, 1019226) Do not be anxious about anything and come back to me after enjoying life for a little longer.
('15', 511, 3, 35, 1019320) I need you for me personally, not for the school, nor for any other work.
('15', 511, 3, 36, 1019394) You may continue where you are for a year or six months.
('15', 511, 3, 37, 1019451) I shall manage without you till then.
('15', 511, 4, 38, 1019489) Send me back this letter after you have read it, for I have given Bapus talk in his own words.
('15', 511, 4, 39, 1019584) They may be forgotten in course of time.

('15', 512, 6, 6, 1019868) As Mr. Gandhi has made a statement 1 which appears by wire in our columns, I think it well to say that my interruption was due to the fact that the Englishman behind me, who, I concluded, was a C.I.D. officer, made the remark, Everything he says is being taken down and will be sent to the Commissioner. As several things said were capable of a construction that I knew Mr. Gandhi could certainly not mean to convey, I thought it better to suggest to the Chairman that politics were out of place in that meeting.
('15', 512, 6, 7, 1020381) I did not suggest to the Princes to leave nor do I know who did.
('15', 512, 6, 8, 1020446) I am well aware Mr. Gandhi would rather be killed than kill.
('15', 512, 6, 9, 1020507) But I do think that his remarks were capable of misconstruction and I feared for his personal safety under conditions existing in Benares.
('15', 512, 6, 10, 1020646) How far from any wish of his is any disturbance of the public peace was shown by his view that we ought not to embarrass the Government even by holding the Congress.

('15', 512, 10, 13, 1020881) The above 2 came to us from the Madras Mail.
('15', 512, 10, 14, 1020926) Mr. Gandhi telephoned to ask if I would put in a statement from him, and I answered yes.
('15', 512, 10, 15, 1021015) I presume that the above from the Madras Mail is the statement.
('15', 512, 11, 16, 1021079) I regret that I must traverse the first paragraph of the statement.
('15', 512, 11, 17, 1021147) I do not see how, if Mrs. Besant was almost behind me, he could have seen me whispering to the princes on the far side of the Maharaja of Darbhanga, nor how they could have heard my whispers; there was one prince on my side, who did not move till after all the rest had gone.
('15', 512, 11, 18, 1021423) I did not leave with the princes, but remained with my friends round me, and in fact Mr. Gandhi says, was discussing with them, while he also says that l left along with the princes.
('15', 512, 11, 19, 1021606) I did not leave till some minutes after the meeting was over, and then not even by the way they went, but by a path which led towards my house from the platform.

('15', 513, 1, 2, 1021981) I have no report of Mr. Gandhis speech, but he desires me to mention the statements which I thought necessitated the interruption.
('15', 513, 1, 3, 1022112) I answer that I thought that in a non political meeting, with princes and many others present who would suffer from Government displeasure, he should not have twice spoken of the possibility of the English being driven bag and baggage out of the country and of his being ready, if he thought Indians fit for self Government which he did not, to march with thousands of his countrymen to the muzzle of English guns and die gloriously; that it was unwise to say bluntly, I am an anarchist, without explaining what he meant, and to speak of bombs bringing about the annulment of the partition of Bengal, with praise of the heroism of those who threw them.
('15', 513, 1, 4, 1022765) I know very well how such statements would appear in a C.I.D. report, as I have suffered from such reports, and I appealed to the Chairman.
('15', 513, 1, 5, 1022905) If the meeting had been called by Mr. Gandhi, it would have been no ones business but his own what he chose to say; as it was, the University Committee, to which I belong, was responsible to those we had invited.
('15', 513, 1, 6, 1023118) It may be that I ought to have left Mr. Gandhi to go his own way, despite the .
('15', 513, 1, 7, 1023198) and the complaints all around me.
('15', 513, 1, 8, 1023232) I meant to do him a kindness and prevent the more violent interruption which would have probably taken place, had I remained silent.
('15', 513, 1, 9, 1023365) l am glad that Mr. Gandhi has explained what he meant to say, though I regret his misstatement about myself.
('15', 513, 1, 10, 1023474) Mr. S. S. Setlurs letter, which I subjoin from the Hindu, gives accurately what occurred.
('15', 513, 2, 11, 1023564) New India, 17 2 1916
('15', 513, 4, 12, 1023585) Those who have read Mr. Gandhis statement on his speech, and his request to me to state the remarks to which I objected, will at once recognize his perfect innocence of all wrong intention.
('15', 513, 5, 13, 1023775) But now that Mr. Gandhi himself has forced my hand, asking for what I had refused to others, I am free to speak out, and to say why words which, from another, would have connoted wrong, were, so far as his intent was concerned, innocent of harm.
('15', 513, 5, 14, 1024021) Moreover, he did not know, as I knew, that the students before him were seething with anger in consequence of the way in which they had been treated by the C.I.D. officers, a number of them interned in the College for the daya gratuitous and provocative insultand also of the way in which respectable men in the town had been arrested during previous days, and others, men and even old women, very roughly used.
('15', 513, 5, 15, 1024433) It was a rather gun powder audience, and I feared that some of them, not knowing Mr. Gandhis principle of non resistance, might take his remarks on the results of bomb throwing as a justification for the use of such means, despite his strictures on them.
('15', 513, 6, 16, 1024688) To consider the remarks themselves, what Mr. Gandhi said as to the English leaving India by compulsion was, I venture to think, unwise, but it did not bear the
('15', 513, 7, 17, 1024848) 1 This is from what appeared with the caption In Defence of M. K. Gandhi under the signature of Annie Besant in the editorial columns.

('15', 514, 1, 2, 1025025) sense that it would have had in my own mouth, since I am actively working for Home Rule.
('15', 514, 1, 3, 1025114) If I had said it, it would have been a threat, because it would have been naturally connected in the minds of many with my demand that India should be a self governing nation, and although I work only for the abolition of bureaucratic rule, and hope that many an Englishman will help in the working of the responsible Government of the future, It would naturally have been said: Why should you suggest such a thing, if you do not want to bring it about? But no such motive can be imputed to Mr. Gandhi, for he distinctly said: You are not fit for self government, and he told the students not to be led away by himself into the idea that they were.
('15', 514, 1, 4, 1025763) IF HE THOUGHT THEM READY, which he did not, he would be willing to march up to the mouth of the guns and die.
('15', 514, 1, 5, 1025873) But it must be remembered that from Mr. Gandhis lips this does not mean fighting, as it would mean from mine.
('15', 514, 1, 6, 1025983) He has already led a crowd against armed men, willing to die but not to slay.
('15', 514, 1, 7, 1026061) His resistance has always been passive, the heroic endurance of suffering, NEVER the infliction of it.
('15', 514, 1, 8, 1026164) And therefore I say that he cannot be judged as an active politician should be.
('15', 514, 1, 9, 1026244) He has risked the lives of himself and his followers, but never those of his opponents.
('15', 514, 2, 10, 1026332) It was unwise to say boldly: I am an anarchist, in a country where anarchism connotes bombs.
('15', 514, 2, 11, 1026425) Now Mr. Gandhi is a philosophic anarchist, like Tolstoy, whom he closely resembles.
('15', 514, 2, 12, 1026509) Many of the noblest and purest men and women in Europe are anarchists in the sense in which Mr. Gandhi used the word.
('15', 514, 2, 13, 1026627) Prince Kropotkin, Edward Carpenter, Walt Whitman, are all men of this school; they are true mystics, and the God within guides them; they need no outside law.
('15', 514, 2, 14, 1026786) The Madras Mail was annoyed that Mr. Gandhi was, apparently, compared to Tolstoy, but Mr. Gandhi is the greater of the twosave from the literary standpoint.
('15', 514, 2, 15, 1026943) Tolstoy lived as a peasant and made shoes for his living; Gandhi lives similarly, and helps in the work of his community.
('15', 514, 2, 16, 1027065) Tolstoy was detested by the Russian Government as Gandhi by the South African; but Gandhi has suffered for his people as Tolstoy never did.
('15', 514, 2, 17, 1027205) Tolstay lived a long way off, so Anglo Indians can afford to admire him, but Gandhi is close at hand, so must be reviled.
('15', 514, 2, 18, 1027327) Both are men of the prophet type and are admired by most peopleat a distance.
('15', 514, 3, 19, 1027405) I have been turning up my speech of 1894, delivered in the pandal of the Madras Congress of that year, and it is curiously applicable, in its remarks on the Prophet, to the philosophic idea of anarchism, the without Government of the far off Golden Age, when none shall teach his brother but all shall be taught of God.
('15', 514, 3, 20, 1027725) The Prophets, like Tolstoy, Gandhi, Carpenter, proclaim that far off ideal, but the work a day world is not ready for it, nor will be for many thousands of years.
('15', 514, 3, 21, 1027888) Only when a man is guided by an interior compulsion, the divine law within, can he afford to dispense with the compulsion of outer law.
('15', 514, 3, 22, 1028024) But what outer law does Gandhi need, who leads a life of utter selflessness, of purity, of simplicity, of daily, hourly, self abnegation?
('15', 514, 3, 23, 1028162) Such men are priceless assets of the nation which gives them birth, and they inspire to heroism and to nobility of character.
('15', 514, 3, 24, 1028288) Hence, I say, that while we may consider some of Mr. Gandhis views as suited better for a far off posterity than for today, and while we regard his politicsif

('15', 515, 1, 2, 1028489) we so name themas impracticable, and even as a hindrance in the path of constitutional change, we would, tens of thousands of us, stand round him, in any attack from Anglo Indians or from the bureaucracy, as one man, and we honour and venerate him for his life and his lofty ideals, even when we think his words unwise in the difficult circumstances of the time.

('15', 515, 4, 5, 1028885) AHIMSA PARAMO DHARMAHA TRUTH OR A FAD?
('15', 515, 5, 6, 1028924) By Lala Lajpat Rai
('15', 515, 6, 7, 1028943) There is no religion higher than truth, nor a course of conduct nobler than Ahimsa Paramo Dharmah.
('15', 515, 6, 8, 1029042) Rightly understood and rightly applied to life, the latter makes a man a saint and a hero.
('15', 515, 6, 9, 1029133) Misunderstood and misapplied, it makes a man cowardly and craven, base and stupid.
('15', 515, 6, 10, 1029216) There was a time when the Indians understood it rightly and made only the proper use of it and they were a race of truthful, noble and brave people.
('15', 515, 6, 11, 1029365) Then came a time when some good people, thoroughly well intentioned and otherwise saintly, made a fad of it, placed it not only at the top of all other virtues, but made it the sole test of a good life.
('15', 515, 6, 12, 1029568) They overdid it not only in their own lives but converted it into a supreme national virtue at the cost of everything else.
('15', 515, 6, 13, 1029692) All other virtues which ennoble men and nations were thrown into the background and subordinated to this, according to them, the supreme test of goodness, courage, bravery, heroism, all lapsed.
('15', 515, 6, 14, 1029886) Honour and self respect were thrown into the shade.
('15', 515, 6, 15, 1029938) Patriotism, love of country, love of family, honour of the race were all extinguished.
('15', 515, 6, 16, 1030025) It was this perverted use or misuse of ahimsa (non killing), or its exaggerated importance at the cost of everything else, that brought about the social, political and moral downfall of the Hindus.
('15', 515, 6, 17, 1030223) They forgot that manliness was as good a virtue as ahimsa.
('15', 515, 6, 18, 1030282) In fact the former was in no way inconsistent with the latter, if rightly applied.
('15', 515, 6, 19, 1030365) They overlooked the fact that individual as well as national interests made it incumbent that the weak should be protected against the strong, and that the aggressor and the usurper, the thief and the scoundrel, the lustful villain and the infamous violator of womens chastity, the ruffian and the cheat, should be prevented from inflicting injustice and doing harm.
('15', 515, 6, 20, 1030732) They ignored the fact that humanity required that the fear of righteous indignation and of the consequences that flow therefrom, should deter the soul of the evilly disposed people from harming innocence, violating purity and depriving others of their just rights.
('15', 515, 6, 21, 1030997) They failed to realize the importance and the sublimity of the truth that whosoever allows or tolerates forceful dominance of evil or tyranny and oppression, in a way abets and encourages it and is partly responsible for the prosperity and strength of the evil doer.
('15', 515, 6, 22, 1031264) Ahimsa overdone and misapplied is a gangrene that poisons the system, enervates the faculties and converts men and women into half lunatic, hysterical, unnerved creatures, good for
('15', 516, 0, 1, 1031445) VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 31 AUGUST, 1917 517
('15', 516, 1, 2, 1031487) nothing that requires the energetic pursuits of noble ends and noble virtues.
('15', 516, 1, 3, 1031565) It converts men into monomaniacs and cowards.
('15', 516, 1, 4, 1031611) The founders of the Jain religion were saintly people, pledged to a life of self abnegation and self mortification.
('15', 516, 1, 5, 1031727) Their followers, the Jain sadhus, are amongst the most saintly people who have achieved the greatest possible success in killing passions and subduing desires both of the senses and the mind.
('15', 516, 1, 6, 1031919) The Tolstoyian ahimsa has been known and practised in India for three thousand years.
('15', 516, 1, 7, 1032005) There is no country on the face of the globe which contains so many and such profound ahimsa ists as India does and which she has been having for centuries.
('15', 516, 1, 8, 1032162) Yet there is no country on the face of the globe which is so downtrodden, so bereft of manly virtues, as India of today is or as India of the last fifteen hundred years has been.
('15', 516, 1, 9, 1032341) Some people may say that it was not the practice of ahimsa that brought about this fall but the desertion of other virtues.
('15', 516, 1, 10, 1032465) I am, however, inclined to insist that the perversion of this truth was at least one of those causes that resulted in Indias forsaking the path of honour, manliness and virtue.
('15', 516, 1, 11, 1032642) The worst is that people who profess an absolute faith in the doctrine, prove by their own practice that a perverted use of such a truth necessarily leads to a life of hypocrisy, unmanliness and cruelty.
('15', 516, 1, 12, 1032846) I was born in a Jain family.
('15', 516, 1, 13, 1032875) My grandfather had an all covering faith in ahimsa.
('15', 516, 1, 14, 1032927) He would rather be bitten by a snake than kill it.
('15', 516, 1, 15, 1032978) He would not harm even a vermin.
('15', 516, 1, 16, 1033011) He spent hours in religious exercise.
('15', 516, 1, 17, 1033049) To all appearances, he was a very virtuous person, who held a high position in his fraternity and commanded great respect.
('15', 516, 1, 18, 1033172) One of his brothers was a sadhu, a high priest who was an exalted leader of his order.
('15', 516, 1, 19, 1033259) This last named gentleman was one of the noblest types of ascetics I have ever met with in my life.
('15', 516, 1, 20, 1033359) He lived up to his principles and excelled in the mortification of the flesh and in keeping down his passions and desires.
('15', 516, 1, 21, 1033482) Yet according to the best standards of ethics, his life was barren and unnatural.
('15', 516, 1, 22, 1033564) I loved and respected him, but I could not follow his creed, nor did he ever show any anxiety to make me do it.
('15', 516, 1, 23, 1033676) His brother, however, i.e., my own grandfather, was a different sort of person.
('15', 516, 1, 24, 1033756) He believed in ahimsa, that perverted ahimsa which forbids the taking of any life under any circumstances whatsoever, but he considered all kinds of trickeries in his trade and profession as not only valid but good.
('15', 516, 1, 25, 1033972) They were permissible according to the ethics of his business.
('15', 516, 1, 26, 1034035) I have known many persons of that faith who would deprive the minor and the widow of their last morsel of food in dealings with them but who would spend thousands in saving lice or birds or other animals standing in danger of being killed.
('15', 516, 1, 27, 1034275) I do not mean to say that the Jains of India are in any way more immoral than the rest of the Hindus or that ahimsa leads to immorality of that kind.
('15', 516, 1, 28, 1034425) Far be it from me to make such an unfounded insinuation.
('15', 516, 1, 29, 1034482) In their own way the Jains are a great community, charitable, hospitable, and intelligent and shrewd men of business.
('15', 516, 1, 30, 1034600) So are some of the other communities 0among the Hindus.
('15', 516, 1, 31, 1034656) What I mean is that the practice of ahimsa in its extreme form has in no way made them better than or morally superior to the other communities.
('15', 516, 1, 32, 1034801) In fact, they are the people who pre eminently suffer from hooliganism and other manifestations of force, because they are more helpless than others, on account of their inherited fear and dislike of force.
('15', 516, 1, 33, 1035008) They cannot defend themselves, nor the honour of those dear and

('15', 517, 1, 4, 1035191) It is good for Europe to have given birth to a Tolstoy.
('15', 517, 1, 5, 1035247) But the case of India is different.
('15', 517, 1, 6, 1035283) In India we do not advocate force and violence for purposes of oppression or usurpation or aggression.
('15', 517, 1, 7, 1035386) India, I trust, will never come to that.
('15', 517, 1, 8, 1035427) But we cannot afford to be taught that it is sinful to use legitimate force for purposes of self defence or for the protection of our honour and the honour of our wives, sisters, daughters and mothers.
('15', 517, 1, 9, 1035629) Such a teaching is unnatural and pernicious.
('15', 517, 1, 10, 1035674) We condemn illegal or unlawful force in the attainment of a lawful object, but we cannot afford to sit silent when a great and a respected man tells our young men that we can only guard the honour of those who are under our charge by delivering ourselves into the hands of the men who would commit the sacrilege and that this requires far great physical and mental courage than delivering blows.
('15', 517, 1, 11, 1036070) Suppose a ruffian assaults our daughter.
('15', 517, 1, 12, 1036111) Mr. Gandhi says that according to his conception of ahimsa, the only way to protect the honour of our daughter is to stand between her and her assailant.
('15', 517, 1, 13, 1036265) But what becomes of the daughter if her assailant fells us and then completes his diabolical intention?
('15', 517, 1, 14, 1036369) According to Mr. Gandhi, it requires greater mental and physical courage to stand still and let him do his worst than to try to stop him by matching our force against his.
('15', 517, 1, 15, 1036541) With great respect for Mr. Gandhi, this has no meaning.
('15', 517, 1, 16, 1036597) I have the greatest respect for the personality of Mr. Gandhi.
('15', 517, 1, 17, 1036660) He is one of those persons whom l idolize.
('15', 517, 1, 18, 1036703) I do not doubt his sincerity.
('15', 517, 1, 19, 1036733) I do not question his motives.
('15', 517, 1, 20, 1036764) But I consider it my duty to raise an emphatic protest against the pernicious doctrine he is reported to have propounded.
('15', 517, 1, 21, 1036886) Even a Gandhi should not be allowed to poison the minds of Young India on this subject.
('15', 517, 1, 22, 1036974) No one should be at liberty to pollute the fountains of national vitality.
('15', 517, 1, 23, 1037049) Not even Buddha, much less Christ, even preached that.
('15', 517, 1, 24, 1037104) I do not know if even the Jains would go to that length.
('15', 517, 1, 25, 1037161) honourable life would be impossible under such conditions.
('15', 517, 1, 26, 1037220) A man who has such a faith cannot consistently resist anyone acting as he likes.
('15', 517, 1, 27, 1037301) Why did Mr. Gandhi then injure the feelings of the white men of South Africa by raising the standard of revolt against their cherished policy of excluding the Indians from that country?
('15', 517, 1, 28, 1037487) To be logical he should have left the country bag and baggage and advised his countrymen to do the same as soon as the South Africans expressed a wish to exclude them.
('15', 517, 1, 29, 1037655) Why, under such circumstances, any resistance would be himsa.
('15', 517, 1, 30, 1037717) After all physical himsa is only a development of mental himsa.
('15', 517, 1, 31, 1037781) If it is a sin to contemplate the worsting of a thief or a robber or any enemy, of course, it is a greater sin to resist him by force.
('15', 517, 1, 32, 1037916) The thing is so absurd on the face of it, that I feel inclined to doubt the accuracy of the report of Mr Gandhis speech.
('15', 517, 1, 33, 1038037) But the Press has been freely commenting on the speech and Mr Gandhi issued no disclaimer.
('15', 517, 1, 34, 1038128) In any case I feel that I cannot sit silent and let this doctrine go as an unquestioned sublime truth to be followed by Young India, so long as the speech remains uncontradicted or unexplained Mr. Gandhi wants to create a world of imaginary perfection.
('15', 517, 1, 35, 1038381) Of course he is free to do it, as he is free to ask others to do it.
('15', 517, 1, 36, 1038450) But in the same way I consider it my duty to point out his error.

GANDHI, We entirely corroborate your statement made by you today to the Commissioner (Tirhut Division) that you have come to this division at the request of the public men of the province to investigate the question of the relations between the indigo planters and Indian raiyats and give us the benefit of your expert assistance in any way you can We were party to the invitation.
('15', 518, 5, 6, 1039113) We further corroborate your statement that you were asked by most of us to move the resolution in the matter before the last Congress but that you declined to do so on the ground that you had not studied the question on the spot.
('15', 518, 5, 7, 1039343) We invited you because we thought that having expert experience you would be the best and most proper person to make a thorough constitutional and impartial inquiry into the matter which would be to the interest of the parties concerned.

('15', 518, 12, 16, 1039787) Nearly all the leading men of this province, numbering about 81, attended the Lucknow Sessions of the Congress as delegates.
('15', 518, 12, 17, 1039912) The Bihar delegates to the Congress at Lucknow requested the Honble Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya and Mr. Gandhi to go to Muzaffarpur and Champaran and study the question about the planters and the raiyats.
('15', 518, 12, 18, 1040117) They promised to visit Muzaffarpur as early as possible.
('15', 518, 12, 19, 1040174) Mr. Gandhi was also requested by Bihar delegates to move a resolution on the subject in the Congress but he declined to do so on the ground that he had not studied the question on the spot.

('15', 519, 8, 8, 1040937) Now therefore I do hereby order you to abstain from remaining in the District which you are required to leave by the next available train.

('15', 519, 17, 16, 1041272) Mr. M. K. Gandhi has come here in response to what he describes as an insistent public demand to inquire into the conditions under which Indians workon indigo plantations and desires the help of the local administration.
('15', 519, 17, 17, 1041493) He came to see me this morning and I explained that the relations between the planters and the ryots had engaged the attention of the administration since the sixties, and that we were particularly concerned with a phase of the problem in Champaran now; but that it was doubtful whether the intervention of a stranger in the middle of the treatment of our case would not prove an embarrassment.
('15', 519, 17, 18, 1041888) I indicated the potentialities of disturbances in Champaran, asked for credentials to show an insistent public demand for his inquiry and said that the matter would probably need reference to Government.
('15', 519, 18, 19, 1042092) I expected that Mr. Gandhi would communicate with me again before he proceeds to Champaran but I have been informed since our interview that his object is likely to be agitation rather than a genuine search for knowledge and it is possible that he may proceed without further reference.
('15', 519, 18, 20, 1042379) I consider that there is a danger of

('15', 520, 1, 3, 1042528) I have the honour to request you to direct him by an order under section 144 Cr.
('15', 520, 1, 4, 1042609) P. C. to leave it at once if he should appear.

('15', 520, 6, 12, 1042857) NOTE BY HONBLE W. MAUDE ON INTERVIEW WITH GANDHIJI
('15', 520, 7, 13, 1042908) May 10, 1917
('15', 520, 9, 14, 1042921) On the 10th May I had a very long talk with Mr. Gandhi....
('15', 520, 10, 15, 1042980) Our conversation was extremely frank and discursive and I cannot attempt to reproduce the gist of it all.
('15', 520, 10, 16, 1043086) The upshot of it was that when I suggested that he must have got a very considerable amount of evidence together by now and might be in a position to make his report, he consented at once to send up a preliminary report, and in the meantime to stop the recording of evidence by his assistants and only make enquiries quietly by himself, visiting only fresh dehats where he is especially invited either by the planter or by the raiyats.
('15', 520, 10, 17, 1043522) I suggested that he should dispense with the services of his assistants and he said he could not make any definite promise about that, and that he was really grieved at the want of faith in the motives and intentions of those assistants.
('15', 520, 10, 18, 1043760) He insisted that if anyone believed that they were regarding it or talking about it behind the scenes as an anti European movement, they would be quite mistaken as there was no suggestion of such a thing.
('15', 520, 10, 19, 1043965) He said he had intended to lay certain definite proposals before the planters which if they accepted he would be able to destroy all his papers and go away; but he admitted that he did not think it would be much use, and that one or two suggestions he had made to planters individually had not met with the response which he had hoped for.
('15', 520, 10, 20, 1044305) I said I did not think it would be the slightest use his approaching the planters, and he could scarcely expect them to regard him as in any way authorised to lay proposals of any kind before them.
('15', 520, 10, 21, 1044503) It would be better if he wrote a report on such materials as he had already collected and sent it to Government or to the Government of India if he preferred that channel.
('15', 520, 10, 22, 1044675) He said he hadnt the slightest desire to go to the Government of India and his idea had been to approach the planters themselves first, if they failed to go to the local officers, if they didnt satisfy him to the Local Government, if they did not satisfy him to the Government of India, and if they didnt satisfy him to appeal as a last resort to pubic opinion in India.
('15', 521, 0, 1, 1045046) 522 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('15', 521, 1, 2, 1045088) In conclusion, he asked to whom he ought to address his report, to the Collector or Commissioner or Local Government.
('15', 521, 1, 3, 1045206) I said it would perhaps be best if he addressed it to the Government as it would relieve the Collector and Commissioner of the necessity of wondering whether they were called on to discuss it in sending it up.
('15', 521, 1, 4, 1045416) He would send a copy to the local officers as a matter of courtesy, and Government could call for any remarks or information as might appear advisable.
('15', 521, 1, 5, 1045568) I said it had been rumoured that he intended to subject Muzaffarpur and Darbhanga to the same process as Champaran, and he said he had so far never had any such intention, though he might visit other parts of the province in a general way in order to complete his knowledge of India generally.
('15', 521, 1, 6, 1045862) I specially commended to his notice a visit to the South of Gaya and the adjoining parts of Hazaribagh where he would find a condition of tenantry in comparison with which the Champaran raiyats are independent and courageous.
('15', 521, 1, 7, 1046088) We wound up a two hours conversation with a most interesting talk of the Colonial emigration question which, however, does not concern this file.

('15', 521, 8, 30, 1047220) You will also have to grow indigo. We have not been obliged to pay anything up to now for grazing cattle.
('15', 521, 8, 31, 1047326) We listened but said nothing.
('15', 521, 8, 32, 1047356) He spoke to his men and went away.
