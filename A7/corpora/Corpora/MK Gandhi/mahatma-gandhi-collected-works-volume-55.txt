('55', 0, 3, 4, 98) KAKU, I got your letter written in a beautiful hand.
('55', 0, 3, 5, 151) You have plenty of things to write about.
('55', 0, 3, 6, 193) Even if you give an account of what you did during the last year, you will have enough material.
('55', 0, 3, 7, 290) You should regard spinning as yajna and do it regularly.

('55', 0, 15, 20, 850) You will get eight if you leave space between the words and use a good pen.
('55', 0, 15, 21, 926) Why does man have no root?
('55', 0, 15, 22, 953) A man carries his root wherever he goes.
('55', 0, 15, 23, 994) A tree has its root under the ground because it comes out of the ground.
('55', 0, 15, 24, 1067) Man is born from his mothers body, and his root also comes out with him at the time of his birth.
('55', 0, 15, 25, 1165) One may say that the navel is his root.

('55', 1, 5, 5, 1489) 4. LETTER TO NARAYAN M. KHARE
('55', 1, 6, 6, 1519) February 10, 1932
('55', 1, 7, 7, 1537) PANDITJI, I got Barves book.
('55', 1, 7, 8, 1566) I will dip into it when I get time.
('55', 1, 8, 9, 1602) Your explanation about the first doubt is quite correct.
('55', 1, 8, 10, 1659) I have felt that that is the implication of Chapter XVII.
('55', 1, 8, 11, 1717) Ultimately one has to rely on faith.
('55', 1, 8, 12, 1754) We see again and again that what seems to be the truth to one does not often appear so to others.
('55', 1, 8, 13, 1852) However, to follow truth as one sees it is like walking on the razors edge.
('55', 1, 8, 14, 1928) Anyone who tries to do so ought to remain wide awake and rigidly follow all the rules and restrictions.
('55', 1, 8, 15, 2032) The lazy, the licentious, and the hypocrites can claim no right to act according to their view of truth.
('55', 1, 8, 16, 2137) That privilege belongs only to the sadhak, the seeker after truth.
('55', 1, 8, 17, 2204) As for the second doubt, I think that the sadhak will not trouble himself with deciding what is and what is not for general good.
('55', 1, 8, 18, 2334) He would say that he was not interested in the question, and that universal good lay in truth since truth was the supreme Being.
('55', 1, 8, 19, 2463) While all other names of God suggested only one aspect of His, truth signified His perfect essence, so that a person who opposed truth could never accomplish anybodys good.
('55', 1, 8, 20, 2636) Truth necessitates harmony of thought, speech and act.
('55', 1, 8, 21, 2691) That is, one must follow truth as one sees it and always be faithful to it in thought, speech and action.
('55', 1, 8, 22, 2797) But a false notion is widely prevalent among us.
('55', 1, 8, 23, 2846) We are not always bound to answer a question asked by anyone.
('55', 1, 8, 24, 2908) There is no violation of truth in refraining from giving an answer.
('55', 1, 8, 25, 2976) To keep silent when it is ones duty to reply to a question amounts to telling a lie.
('55', 1, 8, 26, 3061) For example, if my father asked me whether I had stolen a piece of gold, I would be bound to answer the question.
('55', 1, 8, 27, 3175) However, if even my father asked me whether somebody had stolen a thing, I would not be bound to answer.
('55', 1, 8, 28, 3280) If, therefore, I did not reply, I would not be telling a lie.
('55', 1, 8, 29, 3342) I remember the chapter in
('55', 2, 0, 1, 3368) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 3
('55', 2, 1, 2, 3412) Gitarahasya 1. I did not agree with the suggestion in it.
('55', 2, 1, 3, 3470) If you tell a lie under force of circumstances, you are certainly not telling the truth.
('55', 2, 1, 4, 3559) There never can be an occasion when one must tell a lie.
('55', 2, 1, 5, 3616) If there can be such an occasion, then it would follow that the principle of following truth in speech and action wasimperfect.
('55', 2, 1, 6, 3744) There can be no exception to a principle, and hence there can be no atonement for untruth spoken knowingly.
('55', 2, 1, 7, 3852) Or the only possible atonement would be never to do so again.
('55', 2, 1, 8, 3914) Atonement is possible only when some error is committed in ignorance.
('55', 2, 1, 9, 3984) I think that this answers your second question too.
('55', 2, 1, 10, 4036) Ask again if anything is still left out.
('55', 2, 1, 11, 4077) I have not revised this letter.

('55', 2, 5, 14, 4199) 5. LETTER TO SHARDA C. SHAH
('55', 2, 6, 15, 4227) February 10, 1932
('55', 2, 7, 16, 4245) SHARDA, What you have written is as good as saying that you like pakodas but not chapatis.
('55', 2, 7, 17, 4336) But a person whose body acquires such a tendency should be considered diseased.
('55', 2, 7, 18, 4416) A healthy person will never be able to satisfy his hunger by eating pakodas.
('55', 2, 7, 19, 4493) He would ask only for bread.
('55', 2, 7, 20, 4522) The same is true about the Gita.
('55', 2, 7, 21, 4555) Once your mind has awakened, you are bound to like the Gita.
('55', 2, 7, 22, 4616) You must think that there is something still lacking so long as you cannot like the Gita.
('55', 2, 7, 23, 4706) But I, who prepare such recipes, should also be blamed.
('55', 2, 7, 24, 4762) My prescription of the Gita for you is defective and that is the reason why you are not able to absorb it.
('55', 2, 7, 25, 4869) What is the remedy?

('55', 3, 2, 3, 5082) February 11, 1932
('55', 3, 3, 4, 5100) MIRA, I have your letter which consoles me.
('55', 3, 3, 5, 5144) Those who believe in Gods guidance just do the best they can and never worry.
('55', 3, 3, 6, 5222) The sun has never been known to have suffered from overstrain and yet who slaves with such unexampled regularity as he!
('55', 3, 3, 7, 5342) And why should we think that the sun is inanimate?
('55', 3, 3, 8, 5393) The difference between him and us may bethat he has no choice, we have a margin no matter how precarious it may be.
('55', 3, 3, 9, 5509) But no more speculation of this sort.
('55', 3, 3, 10, 5547) Suffice it for us that we have his brilliant example in the matter of tireless energy.
('55', 3, 3, 11, 5634) If we completely surrender ourselves to His will and really become ciphers, we too voluntarily give up the right of choice and then we need no wear and tear.
('55', 3, 3, 12, 5792) I have just commenced almond paste instead of milk.
('55', 3, 3, 13, 5844) I was daily decreasing the quantity of milk because it was not suiting me.
('55', 3, 3, 14, 5919) It may be that while I am resting, I do not need animal proteid.
('55', 3, 3, 15, 5984) I am simply trying.
('55', 3, 3, 16, 6004) Therefore, if you have more almond paste we had in London, please bring the bottles with you.
('55', 3, 3, 17, 6098) Just now I am flourishing on dates, tomatoes and almond paste, of course with lemon and honey water twice during 24 hours.
('55', 3, 3, 18, 6221) It is too early yet to say how I shall fare without milk.
('55', 3, 3, 19, 6279) I shall not do anything consciously to injure my health, much as I would love to give up milk altogether.
('55', 3, 3, 20, 6385) There may be no time for you to tell me when you come, therefore let me know by letter how you washed the woollen blankets.
('55', 3, 3, 21, 6509) Did you soak them in cold water or warm and how long?
('55', 3, 3, 22, 6563) How much Lux did you use, in how much water?
('55', 3, 3, 23, 6608) I propose to use powdered Apana soap.
('55', 3, 3, 24, 6646) I am in no hurry.
('55', 3, 3, 25, 6664) I take it that you share my letters with the Ashram and that you get from the Ashram what may be worth knowing.
('55', 3, 3, 26, 6776) I had a letter directly from the Privats.
('55', 3, 3, 27, 6818) They seem to have thoroughly enjoyed their stay and I am glad.
('55', 3, 3, 28, 6881) Do you ever meet Manilal our host and his wife?
('55', 3, 3, 29, 6929) If you meet Pyare Ali tell him or send him word not to send any more dates.
('55', 3, 3, 30, 7005) I have about 20 lb.
('55', 3, 3, 31, 7025) from Jerajani.
('55', 3, 3, 32, 7040) Moreover what Pyare Ali gets are old dates and, therefore, they are weevily.

('55', 5, 1, 3, 8499) Your duty now is to complete your work there.
('55', 5, 1, 4, 8545) Study as hard as you can without impairing your health.
('55', 5, 1, 5, 8601) You should learn the wisdom of the swan.
('55', 5, 1, 6, 8642) Do you ever read Tulsidas?
('55', 5, 1, 7, 8669) It is very useful to read him regularly.
('55', 5, 1, 8, 8710) His work contains this verse:
('55', 5, 2, 9, 8740) All things in the world,
('55', 5, 3, 10, 8765) Both living and non living,
('55', 5, 4, 11, 8793) God has created a mixture of good and evil.
('55', 5, 5, 12, 8837) The sage will, like the swan,

('55', 5, 7, 14, 8895) Leaving out the water of evil.
('55', 5, 7, 15, 8926) In the same way you should accept the good which you see there and keep away from the evil.
('55', 5, 7, 16, 9018) Moreover you are there as Indias representative and should always represent what is good in the country.
('55', 5, 7, 17, 9123) Keep away from the evils of India even for the sake of the country where you are.
('55', 5, 7, 18, 9205) Ever since I came to know you at the Sassoon Hospital, I have never imagined you capable of any evil.

('55', 6, 8, 16, 10846) The correct reasoning, however, is this.

('55', 7, 16, 22, 12293) You must learn to avoid even the few mistakes which you make in reciting the Gita verses.

('55', 8, 8, 9, 12983) MATHURI, I will forgive you everything except writing a bad hand.
('55', 8, 8, 10, 13049) You should write each letter [in a word] as neatly as you draw a picture.
('55', 8, 8, 11, 13123) Gajanan is there to help you.
('55', 8, 8, 12, 13153) If you ask him he will teach you how to do so.
('55', 8, 8, 13, 13200) It is a sort of game.
('55', 8, 8, 14, 13222) You need not spend much time inpractising.

('55', 8, 14, 22, 13533) SHANTA, Why should you feel shy because Sardar is here?
('55', 8, 14, 23, 13589) Is it because he is Sardar or because he is a Patel?
('55', 8, 14, 24, 13642) If for the former reason, how long can you escape him?
('55', 8, 14, 25, 13697) And as for being a Patel, he is no more one.

('55', 9, 7, 11, 14449) It does not seem, at least from here, that there is anything about your Hindi teaching that deserves special notice.

('55', 9, 12, 17, 14801) February 13, 1932
('55', 9, 13, 18, 14819) BOYS AND GIRLS, There is one thing which I noticed in English children but miss in those at the Ashram.
('55', 9, 13, 19, 14923) Most of you cannot think what to write in a letter.
('55', 9, 13, 20, 14975) This should not be.
('55', 9, 13, 21, 14995) In this respect English children are smarter.
('55', 9, 13, 22, 15041) I cannot say with certainty whether or not children outside the Ashram are like you.
('55', 9, 13, 23, 15126) You should overcome this weakness.
('55', 9, 13, 24, 15161) So many things happen every day around you that, if you properly observe them, you would be able to write enough to fill pages.
('55', 9, 13, 25, 15289) Why then should you be unable to think of anything to write about when you sit down to write to me?
('55', 9, 13, 26, 15389) One can write all that one did, saw and thought during a day.
('55', 9, 13, 27, 15451) You can say in a letter why you

('55', 10, 1, 3, 15667) You may also say what good thoughts or bad ones came to you on that day.
('55', 10, 1, 4, 15740) It is possible that you are not sure whether you can write about these things in a letter.
('55', 10, 1, 5, 15831) If so, let me tell you that you need have no such doubts.
('55', 10, 1, 6, 15889) You can write just as you would talk to me.
('55', 10, 1, 7, 15933) I shall now see what progress you make next week.
('55', 10, 1, 8, 15983) Letter writing also is an art.
('55', 10, 1, 9, 16014) All our art springs from devotion to truth.
('55', 10, 1, 10, 16058) Anyone who sits down to write a letter with the thought that he would write pure truth and pour out his love, is bound to write an interesting letter, since truth itself is God.
('55', 10, 1, 11, 16236) There will always be art in anything we do or say or write with truth as witness and as object of our worship.

('55', 10, 6, 16, 16476) February 13, 1932
('55', 10, 7, 17, 16494) DEAR SISTERS,
('55', 10, 8, 18, 16508) Your nest is now almost empty.
('55', 10, 8, 19, 16539) However, I write down in these letters, as I remember them from time to time, the things that I thought worth noting.
('55', 10, 8, 20, 16657) As these letters are preserved, they may be of some use perhaps when you reassemble in future.
('55', 10, 8, 21, 16752) You have heard the name of M. Rolland.
('55', 10, 8, 22, 16791) He is a great European writer and a saintly man.
('55', 10, 8, 23, 16840) I went to see him.
('55', 10, 8, 24, 16859) He has a sister who also may now be regarded aged, like him.
('55', 10, 8, 25, 16920) She has remained unmarried with the sole purpose of helping her brother.
('55', 10, 8, 26, 16993) The language of the two, the brother and the sister, is French.
('55', 10, 8, 27, 17057) Rolland does not know English, but the sister does.
('55', 10, 8, 28, 17109) One may say that the sister has merged her identity in her brothers.
('55', 10, 8, 29, 17178) She looks after Rollands needs in every respect.
('55', 10, 8, 30, 17227) She works as his secretary and also as interpreter when Englishmen come to see him.
('55', 10, 8, 31, 17311) Rolland has delicate health, and the sister guards it too.
('55', 10, 8, 32, 17370) Though such examples of renunciation are rare in this world, we do come across them in the West.
('55', 10, 8, 33, 17467) If there are any in our country, I do not know about them.
('55', 10, 8, 34, 17526) By linking up celibacy with moksha we have made it rare, and it has also, therefore, become difficult to observe.
('55', 10, 8, 35, 17640) On the other hand, in the West women observe it of their own free will for the
('55', 11, 0, 1, 17719) 12 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 11, 1, 2, 17760) sake of service to parents or a brother or some other cause, and they find it easy to observe.
('55', 11, 1, 3, 17855) I wish to draw two lessons from this.
('55', 11, 1, 4, 17893) One, the observance of brahmacharya for any selfless purpose is good, and two, its observance is perfectly easy for anybody who has, like Rollands sister, a concrete reason, for his self imposed task leaves such a person no time at all.
('55', 11, 1, 5, 18130) Besides these two, there is of course the particular lesson that women have to learn from this example.

('55', 11, 5, 9, 18336) 20. A LETTER
('55', 11, 6, 10, 18349) February 13, 1932
('55', 11, 7, 11, 18367) CHI., This is what I mean when I say that I think of God every moment.
('55', 11, 7, 12, 18438) During waking hours there is no time when I am not aware that God dwells within and observes everything.
('55', 11, 7, 13, 18543) This awareness is intellectual and has been achieved through long practice.
('55', 11, 7, 14, 18619) I do not say that my heart has such awareness, since I do not think that I am free from all fear.
('55', 11, 7, 15, 18717) I do feel afraid of snakes, etc.
('55', 11, 7, 16, 18750) Even though I look upon death as a friend, I also see deep seated within me the desire to live.
('55', 11, 7, 17, 18846) It seems that I love life and also that I would be ready to die.
('55', 11, 7, 18, 18911) These two feelings together are strange, and because of this weakness I do not think I can say that my awareness of God is a matter of the heart also.
('55', 11, 7, 19, 19062) That the intellect accepts that He dwells in the heart is another matter.
('55', 11, 7, 20, 19136) One who actually feels the presence of God in his heart would be wholly free from blind attachment to the body.
('55', 11, 7, 21, 19248) I can see that I have not reached that stage, and yet so complete and firm is the intellectual acceptance of this idea that I also feel it is slowly sinking into the heart.
('55', 11, 7, 22, 19421) I cannot go further than this.
('55', 11, 8, 23, 19452) I trust you are no more rigid about food.
('55', 11, 8, 24, 19494) It is necessary to take fruit along with milk, and preferably fresh fruit.
('55', 11, 8, 25, 19569) A small quantity of uncooked leafy vegetables also should be included.
('55', 11, 8, 26, 19640) Tomato and lettuce are considered good.
('55', 11, 8, 27, 19680) There is a science of diet too, and it should not be disregarded.
('55', 11, 8, 28, 19746) We know that our food ought to be sattvik,
('55', 11, 9, 29, 19789) 1 Omission as in the source

('55', 12, 1, 2, 19862) but we have to learn from experience which food can be considered sattvik.
('55', 12, 1, 3, 19937) It is not necessary that ones food should have all the characteristics of sattvik food mentioned in the Gita.
('55', 12, 1, 4, 20047) 1 Experience shows that we need fire very little.
('55', 12, 1, 5, 20097) Personally, I am certain in my mind that it is sufficient that our food is ripened by the sun.
('55', 12, 1, 6, 20192) All that I wish to say is that we should give the body what it requires from among the things which are acceptable to us.

('55', 12, 7, 13, 20506) Ramarajya means rule of the people.
('55', 12, 7, 14, 20542) A person like Rama would never wish to rule.
('55', 12, 7, 15, 20587) God calls Himself a servant of his servants.

('55', 12, 12, 21, 20914) February 13, 1932
('55', 12, 14, 22, 20932) I got your letter.
('55', 12, 14, 23, 20951) Whenever a letter from me is delivered late to you, you should examine the postmark and let me know the date [of its clearance].
('55', 12, 15, 24, 21080) To what term has Kisan been sentenced?
('55', 12, 15, 25, 21119) Where is she kept?

('55', 13, 0, 1, 21231) 14 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 13, 1, 2, 21272) must be taken out and kept in the right places, and, if they contain any other material, all the items will have to be listed and properly disposed of.
('55', 13, 1, 3, 21424) If you do not know what to do about them, send the list to me.
('55', 13, 1, 4, 21487) I will then be able to tell you what to do.
('55', 13, 1, 5, 21531) Even if some of the books belong to other people, it does not matter.
('55', 13, 1, 6, 21601) If they bear the names of their owners, they can easily be kept separately from the others.
('55', 13, 1, 7, 21693) If they bear no names there will be no harm if the Ashram stamp is put on them.
('55', 13, 1, 8, 21773) If, afterwards, these books are claimed by any persons, they should be handed over to them.
('55', 13, 1, 9, 21865) Our duty is to take all possible care of the books while they are in our possession.
('55', 13, 1, 10, 21950) Which statement of mine did you interpret to mean that, according to me, the Ashram had nothing to do with education?
('55', 13, 1, 11, 22068) My view is this: literary educationformal educationis given a secondary place in the Ashram.
('55', 13, 1, 12, 22161) That is why the Ashram could not be made a Vidyapith.
('55', 13, 1, 13, 22215) But such education is certainly useful and necessary, and that is why the Vidyapith was established.
('55', 13, 1, 14, 22316) The Ashram and the Vidyapith supplement each other.
('55', 13, 1, 15, 22368) Because of this limitation of its sphere of activities, the collection of books in the Ashram should be restricted.
('55', 13, 1, 16, 22484) 1 The Vidyapith can have no such restriction.
('55', 13, 1, 17, 22530) The restrictions on it relate to its internal experiments.
('55', 13, 1, 18, 22589) The Ashram has a big name and certain extravagant notions have come to be formed about it, so that it receives books on all kinds of subjects and in many languages.
('55', 13, 1, 19, 22754) The Vidyapith is the right place where they can be preserved.
('55', 13, 1, 20, 22816) The Ashram, on the other hand, should have only such books as relate to the subjects which we study.
('55', 13, 1, 21, 22917) What books fall in this class, you and others can easily decide.
('55', 13, 1, 22, 22982) Whenever you cannot decide you may consult me.
('55', 13, 1, 23, 23029) Personally, however, I dont see what difficulty you can experience in this matter.
('55', 13, 1, 24, 23112) After so many years of the Ashrams existence, we should be able to tell immediately what kinds of books we generally require.
('55', 13, 1, 25, 23238) If at any time we require some other books, we can take advantage of the collection in the Vidyapith.
('55', 13, 1, 26, 23340) We should not regard the Ashram and the Vidyapith as two independent institutions.
('55', 13, 1, 27, 23423) Their spheres of activity are different, but the two have much in common between them and that area is gradually expanding.
('55', 13, 1, 28, 23547) If you do not understand any point in this, ask me again.
('55', 13, 1, 29, 23605) I am sure I do not consciously refuse to hear or observe
('55', 13, 2, 30, 23662) 1 The addressee had objected to the transfer of books to the Vidyapith as this would be so much loss to the Ashram.

('55', 14, 1, 2, 23823) anything against a person about whom my views are formed.
('55', 14, 1, 3, 23881) 1 I always hear what others say, but my views may not change.
('55', 14, 1, 4, 23943) I think it would be wrong for anyone to change, quickly, views formed after careful observation.
('55', 14, 1, 5, 24040) It would, of course, be obstinacy never to change them.
('55', 14, 1, 6, 24096) Hence, that too would be wrong.
('55', 14, 1, 7, 24128) But there should be a sound reason for changing such a view.
('55', 14, 1, 8, 24189) Often I require the evidence of proved facts.
('55', 14, 1, 9, 24235) I cherish this nature of mine, which has saved me from many dangers and kept my relations with people unclouded by suspicion.
('55', 14, 1, 10, 24361) You are, therefore, free to ask me what you like.
('55', 14, 1, 11, 24411) You will not get such an opportunity again.
('55', 14, 1, 12, 24455) The distinction you have made is correct.
('55', 14, 1, 13, 24497) 2 The writer of articles in Young India is one person, and the man whom the inmates of the Ashram know intimately is another.
('55', 14, 1, 14, 24623) In Young India, I might present myself as one of the Pandavas, but, in the Ashram, how can I help showing myself as I am?
('55', 14, 1, 15, 24745) I am, moreover, a votary of truth and can make no attempt consciously to hide my weaknesses.
('55', 14, 1, 16, 24838) Hence, the Kauravas dwelling in me make their presence felt in one way or another.
('55', 14, 1, 17, 24921) Havent you said that a conflict is always going on in me between the divine and the demoniac?
('55', 14, 1, 18, 25015) I feel, however, that the Kauravas are being vanquished.
('55', 14, 1, 19, 25072) But one cannot yet be positive about that.
('55', 14, 1, 20, 25115) As Solon 3 has said, the final judgment about a man can be expressed only after his death.
('55', 14, 1, 21, 25206) I have known cases in which crores were reduced to a cowrie in a moment.
('55', 14, 1, 22, 25279) I have, therefore, no pride in me at all.

('55', 15, 2, 3, 25831) YERAVDA MANDIR, February 13, 1932
('55', 15, 3, 4, 25865) SHANKERLAL, I have your letter.
('55', 15, 3, 5, 25897) If you think it is proper, write a letter to Ramanathan pointing out the faults in his thinking.
('55', 15, 3, 6, 25994) Maybe it is our duty to write to him, considering he has served us for so long.
('55', 15, 3, 7, 26074) Let him misuse if he must what we write to him.
('55', 15, 3, 8, 26122) This is only a suggestion.
('55', 15, 3, 9, 26149) The weaver Ramji 1 writes that he does not have any yarn.
('55', 15, 3, 10, 26207) Narandas may have mentioned this to you.
('55', 15, 3, 11, 26248) But since he has written to me, I am drawing your attention to it.
('55', 15, 3, 12, 26315) Are you able to meet Gulzarilal?
('55', 15, 3, 13, 26348) His wife is perhaps there with him.
('55', 15, 3, 14, 26384) How is his physical condition?
('55', 15, 3, 15, 26415) Does he get the food his body needs.
('55', 15, 3, 16, 26452) Who is now in his place?
('55', 15, 3, 17, 26477) We are both keeping well.
('55', 15, 3, 18, 26503) I have given up milk for the time being as it does not suit me.
('55', 15, 3, 19, 26567) Instead of that, I am taking roasted and ground almonds which I had brought from England.
('55', 15, 3, 20, 26657) It keeps me in good health.
('55', 15, 3, 21, 26685) It remains to be seen whether or not the weight is maintained.
('55', 15, 3, 22, 26748) You must be having information about Mridulas health.
('55', 15, 3, 23, 26802) Let me know how she is.

('55', 16, 1, 4, 27397) Those who find their happiness in self denial should seek opportunities to practise it in all circumstances.
('55', 16, 1, 5, 27506) The field for such opportunities is unlimited.
('55', 16, 1, 6, 27553) One should not seek self denial which will tear apart the skin on ones back.
('55', 16, 1, 7, 27630) Such self denial is forbidden.
('55', 16, 1, 8, 27661) Let him remember the following two shlokas:
('55', 16, 2, 9, 27705) Those men who, wedded to pretentiousness and arrogance, possessed by the violence of lust and passion, practise fierce austerity not ordained by Shastras.
('55', 16, 3, 10, 27860) They, whilst they torture the several elements that make up their bodies, torture Me to dwelling in them; know them to be of unholy re solves.

('55', 17, 3, 4, 29046) NARANDAS, I got both your packets.
('55', 17, 3, 5, 29081) The fact that Ramji does not get yarn means, does it not, that we are short of it.
('55', 17, 3, 6, 29164) Is the position likely to be the same at other places too?
('55', 17, 3, 7, 29223) You alone can explain this.
('55', 17, 3, 8, 29251) I think you know that Madanmohan Bauhra wishes to come here for my darshan.
('55', 17, 3, 9, 29327) Read my reply to him.
('55', 17, 3, 10, 29349) The problem of Budhabhai and Parvati seems a difficult one.
('55', 17, 3, 11, 29409) Personally, I feel that they should live separately for some time.

('55', 17, 3, 13, 29523) If something else occurs to you, write to me.
('55', 17, 3, 14, 29569) Does Parvati behave properly in the Ashram?
('55', 17, 3, 15, 29613) Does she observe the rules?
('55', 17, 3, 16, 29641) You are being tested fairly well, it seems.
('55', 17, 3, 17, 29685) February 12, 1932
('55', 17, 4, 18, 29703) You have to carry a fairly good burden on account of the dairy.

('55', 17, 4, 20, 29851) It will be enough if Parnerkar can live there quietly.
('55', 17, 4, 21, 29906) Let him do what he wishes.
('55', 17, 4, 22, 29933) My views about the orchard should be treated as those of a man without experience in that field.
('55', 17, 4, 23, 30030) That is, unless they are confirmed by an expert, count them as no better than deserving to be thrown into the river Sabarmati.
('55', 17, 4, 24, 30157) Get some news about Prabhudas.
('55', 17, 4, 25, 30188) If it is necessary, as his guardian, write to the authorities where he was sentenced to and inquire in which jail he is kept.

('55', 18, 6, 12, 31677) Immediately on my landing I entrusted the research to Advocate Munshi, a member of the Bombay University Senate, and two other educationist 4 friends.
('55', 18, 6, 13, 31828) But they too like me find themselves civil resistance prisoners.
('55', 18, 6, 14, 31893) I had asked Advocate Munshi to put himself in direct touch with you.
('55', 18, 6, 15, 31962) But his arrest came so soon after mine that I hardly think he could have corresponded with you.

('55', 18, 6, 18, 32204) As I found in you a fellow seeker after the truth, I was most anxious to give you satisfaction either by confirming my statement or withdrawing it as publicly as I had made it.

('55', 21, 3, 4, 35715) DEAR SISTERS, Regardless of your number, someone among you should still shoulder the responsibility and keep your Association going.
('55', 21, 3, 5, 35848) Prayers should continue without any change.
('55', 21, 3, 6, 35892) I should regularly get a letter on behalf of all the women.
('55', 21, 3, 7, 35952) Otherwise I, too, am likely by and by to get tired of writing.
('55', 21, 3, 8, 36015) Who among you has charge of my letters and preserves them?
('55', 21, 3, 9, 36074) I will write today about a school that struck me as a wonderful institution.
('55', 21, 3, 10, 36151) One or two men and one or two women run it jointly.
('55', 21, 3, 11, 36203) They believe that even the dullest child responds to the law of love.
('55', 21, 3, 12, 36273) And, accordingly, they have taken in hand the work of educating abandoned orphans who have become practically mindless.
('55', 21, 3, 13, 36393) The school is run according to certain principles which their teacher has discovered through experiments in the method of love.
('55', 21, 3, 14, 36521) These men and women have dedicated their lives to such children, who do not know that they are destitute and have no parents.
('55', 21, 3, 15, 36647) They are brought up in open air and sunshine; the building they live in stands on spacious open ground.
('55', 21, 3, 16, 36751) They are cured chiefly with the help of music.
('55', 21, 3, 17, 36798) They make some slow artistic movements to the accompaniment of music, and even become absorbed in them.
('55', 21, 3, 18, 36902) The women teachers treat the children as their own.
('55', 21, 3, 19, 36954) They have their meals with the children, keep them cheerful and busy in games the whole day and gradually bring them out of their stupor.
('55', 21, 3, 20, 37092) These kind hearted men and women have been carrying on this experiment for the last three or four years only.
('55', 21, 3, 21, 37202) This wonderful school is situated very near to where Mr. Horace Alexander lives.
('55', 21, 3, 22, 37283) Seeing the school, I bowed my head in reverence and wondered what love could not do.
('55', 21, 3, 23, 37368) It can make the dumb speak and the lame climb a mountain.

('55', 23, 10, 20, 39709) You are sure that beating necessarily involves violence but it is not so.
('55', 23, 10, 21, 39783) Supposing somebody has been bitten by a snake and is about to faint.
('55', 23, 10, 22, 39852) In that case he will have to be fed even if it means beating him.
('55', 23, 10, 23, 39918) This is no violence because this beating is inspired by love and is for the good of the patient.But supposing I have an ill feeling for you in my mind but do not beat you for want of an opportunity.
('55', 23, 10, 24, 40117) Such an ill feeling is violence.
('55', 23, 10, 25, 40150) The origin of violence lies in our own minds.

('55', 25, 6, 12, 42060) PREMA, Your letter was very good.
('55', 25, 6, 13, 42094) I was glad that you wrote quite freely.
('55', 25, 6, 14, 42134) This is my reply to your criticism 1. I must hear what the persons concerned have to say in their defence.
('55', 25, 6, 15, 42241) Only after that can I express my opinion in each case.
('55', 25, 6, 16, 42296) In a general way, however, I can say that, whenever some freedom was permitted, it was done not as a privilege but as a matter of necessity.
('55', 25, 6, 17, 42437) I have formed the impression that those who permit themselves any freedom do so not out of lethargy but because their bodies, or say their natures, demand it.
('55', 25, 6, 18, 42596) We ought not to sit in judgment over others.
('55', 25, 6, 19, 42641) We may not even be aware of the effort they make [to follow the rules].
('55', 25, 6, 20, 42713) This does not mean that such persons have no imperfection in them.
('55', 25, 6, 21, 42780) If they did not have any, why did they join the Ashram at all?
('55', 25, 6, 22, 42843) They are not hypocrites.
('55', 25, 6, 23, 42868) There is a great error in believing that everyone should or can do what one does.
('55', 25, 6, 24, 42950) If I tried to lift a weight which Hariyomal 2 can, I would die that very moment.
('55', 25, 6, 25, 43031) Similarly, it would be wrong of him to envy me my weakness.
('55', 25, 6, 26, 43091) Many have said that people deceive me.
('55', 25, 6, 27, 43130) I dont say that no one deceives me, but the number of such persons is certainly not large.

('55', 26, 1, 2, 43421) have observed that many persons cannot, when they are away from me, keep up the standard of behaviour which they preserve when I am there.
('55', 26, 1, 3, 43560) Some even leave me for this reason.
('55', 26, 1, 4, 43596) There are many such instances and that is why I have been accused of possessing a kind of magnetism.
('55', 26, 1, 5, 43697) But this is not likely to satisfy you or others.
('55', 26, 1, 6, 43746) Nor have I said this to defend myself.
('55', 26, 1, 7, 43785) I have only explained my attitude.
('55', 26, 1, 8, 43820) The real position, however, is this, and I have held this belief for many years.
('55', 26, 1, 9, 43901) The deficiencies of the Ashram reflect my own.
('55', 26, 1, 10, 43948) I have told many people that they cannot know me by meeting me.
('55', 26, 1, 11, 44012) When they meet me, I may even impress them as being good.
('55', 26, 1, 12, 44070) Even if I am not good, people would believe that I was because I am a lover of truth.
('55', 26, 1, 13, 44156) My love of truth casts a momentary spell over people.
('55', 26, 1, 14, 44210) In order to know me, people should see the Ashram in my absence.
('55', 26, 1, 15, 44275) There would be no error and no injustice to me in believing that all its deficiencies are a reflection of my own deficiencies.
('55', 26, 1, 16, 44402) It is but true that I have drawn the crowd which has gathered in the Ashram.
('55', 26, 1, 17, 44479) If, though living in the Ashram, they have not been able to overcome their weaknesses but have, on the contrary, developed more, the fault is not theirs but mine.
('55', 26, 1, 18, 44642) The imperfection of my spiritual striving is responsible for this state of affairs.
('55', 26, 1, 19, 44726) Nor is it that I do not observe or know about my shortcomings.
('55', 26, 1, 20, 44789) All that I can say is that they are there despite my best efforts to overcome them.
('55', 26, 1, 21, 44873) And, moreover, I am convinced that, because I am ceaselessly striving to improve the Ashram, it has not, on the whole, fallen altogether from its ideal.
('55', 26, 1, 22, 45026) I derive some satisfaction from the thought that every one of the three Ashrams which I established served or has served its immediate aim.
('55', 26, 1, 23, 45166) I will not, however, deceive myself or anybody else with this comforting thought.
('55', 26, 1, 24, 45248) I wish to travel far and there are hills and valleys to be crossed on the way.
('55', 26, 1, 25, 45327) I am resolved, however, to continue the journey.
('55', 26, 1, 26, 45376) And I rest in peace in the knowledge that there is no defeat in the quest for truth.
('55', 26, 1, 27, 45461) It is true indeed that the Ashram has not been able to attract the learned class.
('55', 26, 1, 28, 45543) The reason is that I dont regard myself as a learned man.
('55', 26, 1, 29, 45601) The few learned men who were drawn to the Ashram joined it not in order to pursue their learned callings but to receive and nurse something else altogether.
('55', 26, 1, 30, 45758) They [are] seekers after truth.
('55', 26, 1, 31, 45790) The quest of truth may be undertaken even by the illiterate, by children and by theold, by women and by men.
('55', 26, 1, 32, 45899) Literary education sometimes serves as the golden lid which covers the face of truth.
('55', 26, 1, 33, 45985) I do not, by saying this,
('55', 27, 0, 1, 46011) 28 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 27, 1, 2, 46052) condemn such education, but only put it in its proper place.
('55', 27, 1, 3, 46113) It is one of the means [in the pursuit of truth].
('55', 27, 1, 4, 46163) We have selected most of the prayers from Sanskrit because it is chiefly Hindus who joined the Ashram.
('55', 27, 1, 5, 46266) We have no aversion to prayers in other languages.
('55', 27, 1, 6, 46317) Dont we use such prayers occasionally?
('55', 27, 1, 7, 46356) If, instead of a large number of Hindus, a large number of Muslims had joined the Ashram, prayers from the Koran would be recited every day and I would even join such prayers.
('55', 27, 1, 8, 46532) Does this answer your doubts?
('55', 27, 1, 9, 46562) Does it satisfy you?
('55', 27, 1, 10, 46583) If it does not, ask me again and again.

('55', 27, 4, 17, 46907) I wrote that to Kamu many years ago.
('55', 27, 4, 18, 46944) Doctors are now gradually coming to the conclusion that all diseases have one common cause and that, therefore, their main remedy also should be one.
('55', 27, 4, 19, 47094) If anybody disregards modifications of that one remedy, that would not do him much or any harm.
('55', 27, 4, 20, 47190) It might be said that the disease was not cured.
('55', 27, 4, 21, 47239) But what even if the disease is cured?
('55', 27, 4, 22, 47278) Surely the body does not become immune to death.
('55', 27, 4, 23, 47327) Hence, if anybody sticks to only one remedy with faith, he commits no sin.
('55', 27, 4, 24, 47402) This is also true about spiritual maladies.
('55', 27, 4, 25, 47446) The cause is always one, and that is the ego.
('55', 27, 4, 26, 47492) The remedy also is onegiving up the ego, that is, reducing oneself to a cipher.
('55', 27, 4, 27, 47572) How will one who is a cipher steal?
('55', 27, 4, 28, 47608) How will he tell a lie or commit adultery?
('55', 27, 4, 29, 47651) The very questions you have asked spring from ignorance.
('55', 27, 4, 30, 47708) Let us take just one example.
('55', 27, 4, 31, 47738) Of course you do not steal in the ordinary sense, but you are right in thinking that your lack of control in eating is a form of stealing.
('55', 27, 4, 32, 47877) The remedy for this kind of stealing and the ordinary kind must be the same, that is, to give up the habit, to stop eating what you should not.

('55', 28, 1, 2, 48136) But who is it that eats such food?
('55', 28, 1, 3, 48171) The ego self.
('55', 28, 1, 4, 48185) Once that has vanished, the other self, though eating, will not be eating and will only give the body its wages.
('55', 28, 1, 5, 48298) There will be no more question, then, of indulging the palate.
('55', 28, 1, 6, 48361) Probably you will accept all this with your reason, but it will have meaning only if it sinks into the heart.
('55', 28, 1, 7, 48471) We live in the Ashram and seek good company, sing bhajans, etc., daily, in order that this truth may sink into the heart.
('55', 28, 1, 8, 48593) Some day we shall find what we are seeking.
('55', 28, 1, 9, 48637) In other words, our malady in the form of the ego will be cured.
('55', 28, 1, 10, 48702) From this you should be able to deduce all the answers, and if you cannot, no matter how much I write and explain, you will not feel satisfied.

('55', 29, 2, 3, 49807) SHIVABHAI, I have your letter.
('55', 29, 2, 4, 49838) There is not the slightest doubt that if we condone or take direct or indirect advantage of the untruth spoken or practised by a person with whom we associate, we become party to his untruth.
('55', 29, 2, 5, 50030) It is for this reason that Tulsidas advises us to seek the company of the good.
('55', 29, 2, 6, 50110) However, in practical life we cannot always live up to the ideal.
('55', 29, 2, 7, 50176) We have to bear with our co workers.
('55', 29, 2, 8, 50213) We may consider the circumstances in each case and act within the limits of our capacity.
('55', 29, 2, 9, 50303) We ought not to join where untruth is being deliberately practised, but having once found ourselves in a certain situation, it may not be possible to force ourselves out of it.
('55', 29, 2, 10, 50480) Where the situation is ab initio permeated with untruth, we have of course the weapon of non co operation.
('55', 29, 2, 11, 50587) Surely, it cannot be claimed that no one practises untruth in the Ashram.
('55', 29, 2, 12, 50661) Still, we do not close down the Ashram, nor do we condone untruth; but we bear with our associates and strive to advance further every day.
('55', 29, 2, 13, 50801) Nobody in this world can do more than this.
('55', 29, 2, 14, 50845) Have you come to know about the new method of spinning the takli?
('55', 29, 2, 15, 50911) It is being practised at Wardha.
('55', 29, 2, 16, 50944) One can draw 160 rounds in half an hour by following it.

('55', 31, 4, 16, 53573) CHAPTER I 3
('55', 31, 5, 17, 53585) Tuesday Morning, November 11, 1930 The Gita is a small portion of the Mahabharata.
('55', 31, 5, 18, 53668) The latter is generally looked upon as a historical work.
('55', 31, 5, 19, 53726) To us, however, the Mahabharata and the Ramayana are not historical works but are treatises on religion.
('55', 31, 5, 20, 53831) Or, if we call them histories, they narrate the
('55', 31, 6, 21, 53879) 1 Rukmini Benarsilal Bazaj, daughter of Maganlal Gandhi 2 Written during Gandhijis incarceration in Yeravda Central Prison in 1930 and 1932, these were sent weekly along with letters to Narandas Gandhi for being read out at the Ashram prayer meetings.
('55', 31, 6, 22, 54131) Gandhiji commenced the series with Chapter Xll; vide Letter to Behramji Khambhatta, 4 11 1930. The following week Gandhiji sent Chapter I, with a general introductory note on the Gita.
('55', 31, 6, 23, 54316) All the chapters are given here under February 19/21, 1932, the date of despatch of the letter to Narandas Gandhi, which carried the discourse on Chapter XVllI and concluded the series; vide the following item.
('55', 31, 6, 24, 54527) The translation is reproduced from the Discourses on the Gita (Navajivan Publishing House, Ahmedabad 14, 1960) with slight changes to bring the text into conformity with the Gujarati original.
('55', 31, 6, 25, 54720) The Translators Preface in the Discourses on the Gita says: Gandhijis Gujarati translation of the Gita was published on March 12, 1930, the never to be forgotten day on which he marched to Dandi from Sabarmati.
('55', 31, 6, 26, 54931) A member of the Ashram who read it found it very difficult to understand and complained about it to Gandhiji who was then in Yeravda Prison.
('55', 31, 6, 27, 55072) Thereupon, he wrote a series of letters to the Ashram in which he devoted one letter to each chapter on the Gita.
('55', 31, 6, 28, 55186) . For Gandhijis discourses on the Gita at Ashram prayer meetings in 1926, vide Discourses on the Gita, and for his Gujarati translation of the Gita with a commentary thereon written in 1929, vide Anasaktiyoga.
('55', 31, 6, 29, 55396) 3 This was sent along with Letter to Narandas Gandhi 11 11 1930; vide Letter to Narandas Gandhi, 11 11 1930
('55', 32, 0, 1, 55504) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 33
('55', 32, 1, 2, 55549) history of the human soul; they do not tell of what happened thousands of years ago, but depict what takes place in the heart of every human being today.
('55', 32, 1, 3, 55703) Both the works describe the eternal war between the God and the demon in manbetween Rama and Ravana.
('55', 32, 1, 4, 55804) The Gita does this in the form of a dialogue between Arjuna and Krishna.
('55', 32, 1, 5, 55877) The dialogue is narrated to the blind Dhritarashtra by Sanjaya.
('55', 32, 1, 6, 55941) Literally Gita means that which is sung.
('55', 32, 1, 7, 55982) The adjective applies to the noun Upanishad, which is understood, and so the full meaning of the phrase is the Upanishad which was sung.
('55', 32, 1, 8, 56119) Upanishad means knowledge teaching.
('55', 32, 1, 9, 56155) The word Gita, therefore, means Shri Krishnas teaching to Arjuna.
('55', 32, 1, 10, 56221) In reading the Gita we should feel that Shri KrishnaGoddwells in our hearts as the holy spirit within us, and that when, yearning for knowledge, like Arjuna, we take our spiritual difficulties to Him and seek His guidance, seek refuge in Him, He is ever ready to instruct us.
('55', 32, 1, 11, 56497) We slumber, but the Lord within us is ever awake.
('55', 32, 1, 12, 56547) He is only waiting for spiritual yearning to be awakened in us.
('55', 32, 1, 13, 56611) We, however, do not know how to question Him, do not even feel the desire to do so.
('55', 32, 1, 14, 56695) And so we read a work like the Gita every day and meditate over its teaching.
('55', 32, 1, 15, 56773) By doing so, we wish to awaken spiritual yearning in us and learn what questions to put to the Lord.
('55', 32, 1, 16, 56874) Whenever we are faced with spiritual difficulties, we turn to the Gita for their solution and obtain peace of mind through it.
('55', 32, 1, 17, 57001) This is the spirit in which we should read the work.
('55', 32, 1, 18, 57054) It is as it were our revered guru, our mother, and we should have faith that we shall be safe if we seek shelter in her lap.
('55', 32, 1, 19, 57179) We can get all our spiritual difficulties solved through the Gita.
('55', 32, 1, 20, 57246) Anyone who daily meditates over the teaching of the Gita in this manner will ever experience new joy in his study and find new meanings.
('55', 32, 1, 21, 57383) There is no spiritual problem which the Gita cannot solve, though it may be that owing to our imperfect faith we do not know how to read and understand the work.
('55', 32, 1, 22, 57545) We read the Gita as daily spiritual practice so that our faith may increase from day to day and we may become vigilant.
('55', 32, 1, 23, 57665) I give here, for the guidance of the inmates of the Ashram, the meaning of the Gita which my daily meditation over its teaching has revealed or reveals to me.
('55', 32, 1, 24, 57824) When the Pandavas and the Kauravas gathered together on the battle field of Kurukshetra (the field of Kuru) with their armies, Duryodhana, the king of the Kauravas, approached Drona (his teacher in the science of war) and named the leading warriors on either side.
('55', 32, 1, 25, 58089) As a signal for the battle to begin, conch shell horns were sounded on both the sides and Shri Krishna who was Arjunas charioteer drove his
('55', 33, 0, 1, 58229) 34 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 33, 1, 2, 58270) chariot into a place between the two armies.
('55', 33, 1, 3, 58315) The scene which greeted Arjunas eyes unnerved him, and he said to Shri Krishna: How can I attack these in battle?
('55', 33, 1, 4, 58429) I might readily enough if I had to fight with strangers, but these are my kinsmen.
('55', 33, 1, 5, 58512) The Kauravas and the Pandavas are first cousins.
('55', 33, 1, 6, 58561) We were brought up together.
('55', 33, 1, 7, 58590) Drona is our teacher as well as the Kauravas.
('55', 33, 1, 8, 58636) Bhishma is a revered elder for both.
('55', 33, 1, 9, 58673) How can I fight against him?
('55', 33, 1, 10, 58702) It is true that the Kauravas are miscreants and doers of evil deeds.
('55', 33, 1, 11, 58771) They have wronged the Pandavas and deprived them oftheir lands.
('55', 33, 1, 12, 58835) They have insulted the saintly Draupadi.
('55', 33, 1, 13, 58876) But what shall I gain by killing them?
('55', 33, 1, 14, 58915) They are fools indeed.
('55', 33, 1, 15, 58938) But shall I also be equally foolish?
('55', 33, 1, 16, 58975) I have some little knowledge.
('55', 33, 1, 17, 59005) I can discriminate between right and wrong.
('55', 33, 1, 18, 59049) I thus see that it is a sin to fight against relatives.
('55', 33, 1, 19, 59105) Never mind if they have taken wrongful possession of the Pandavas share in the kingdom.
('55', 33, 1, 20, 59193) Never mind even if they kill us.
('55', 33, 1, 21, 59226) But how dare we raise our hand against them?
('55', 33, 1, 22, 59271) O Krishna, I will not fight against my kith and kin. With these words, Arjuna sank down on the seat of the chariot, being overwhelmed by grief.
('55', 33, 1, 23, 59415) Here ends the first Chapter which is entitled The Sorrow of Arjuna.
('55', 33, 1, 24, 59483) All of us should feel pain even as Arjuna did.
('55', 33, 1, 25, 59530) No acquisition of knowledge is possible unless there is in us a sense of something lacking and a desire to know the truth.
('55', 33, 1, 26, 59653) If a man is not curious even to know what is wrong and what is right, what is the use of religion for him?
('55', 33, 1, 27, 59760) The battle field of Kurukshetra only provides the occasion for the dialogue between Arjuna and Krishna.
('55', 33, 1, 28, 59864) The real Kurukshetra is the human heart, which is also a dharmakshetra (the field of righteousness) if we look upon it as the abode of God and invite Him to take hold of it.
('55', 33, 1, 29, 60038) Some battle or other is fought on this battle field from day to day.
('55', 33, 1, 30, 60107) Most of these battles arise from the distinction between mine and thine, between kinsmen and strangers.
('55', 33, 1, 31, 60211) Therefore, as we shall find later on, the Lord tells Arjuna that attraction (raga) and repulsion (dvesha) lie at the root of sin.
('55', 33, 1, 32, 60341) When I look upon a person or thing as mine, raga takes hold of my mind; and when I look upon him as a stranger, aversion or hatred enters the mind.
('55', 33, 1, 33, 60489) Therefore we must forget the distinction between mine and thine.
('55', 33, 1, 34, 60554) That is to say, we must give up our likes and dislikes.
('55', 33, 1, 35, 60610) This is the teaching of the Gita and all other scriptures.
('55', 33, 1, 36, 60669) To say this is one thing; to practise it is quite another.
('55', 33, 1, 37, 60728) The Gita is there to teach us how to practise We will try to understand the method it recommends.
('55', 34, 0, 1, 60826) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 35
('55', 34, 1, 2, 60871) CHAPTER II 1
('55', 34, 2, 3, 60884) Monday Morning, November 17, 1930 When Arjuna had picked himself up a little, the Lord rebuked him and said: How is it that this delusion has come to you?
('55', 34, 2, 4, 61039) It is unworthy of a warrior like you. But even then Arjuna stuck to his first position, refused to fight and said: If in order to get it, I have toslay elders and other relations, I do not want not only a kingdom on this earth but even the delights of paradise.
('55', 34, 2, 5, 61301) My mind gropes in darkness.
('55', 34, 2, 6, 61329) I do not know where my duty lies.
('55', 34, 2, 7, 61363) I put myself into your hands.
('55', 34, 2, 8, 61393) Please guide me. Finding that Arjuna was bewildered and aspired after knowledge, Krishna had pity on him and proceeded to explain things to him: Your sorrow is for nothing, and you utter words about wisdom without understanding.
('55', 34, 2, 9, 61622) You have evidently forgotten the distinction between the body and the embodied soul.
('55', 34, 2, 10, 61707) The soul never dies; but the body passes through childhood, youth and old age and perishes in the end.
('55', 34, 2, 11, 61810) The body is born but the soul is birthless and unchanging.
('55', 34, 2, 12, 61869) It ever was, is now and will be there for all time to come.
('55', 34, 2, 13, 61929) For whom then do you grieve?
('55', 34, 2, 14, 61958) Your grief arises from a delusion.
('55', 34, 2, 15, 61993) You look upon these Kauravas as your own, but you are aware that their bodies will come to an end.
('55', 34, 2, 16, 62092) And as for the souls which inhabit these bodies, no one can destroy them.
('55', 34, 2, 17, 62166) The soul cannot be wounded by weapons, burned by fire, dried by the wind or drowned in water.
('55', 34, 2, 18, 62260) Then again, consider this from the standpoint of your duty as a warrior with an army under his command.
('55', 34, 2, 19, 62364) If you refuse to fight this righteous war, the consequences will be the very reverse of what you expect and you will become an object of ridicule.
('55', 34, 2, 20, 62511) You have always enjoyed the reputation of being a brave man.
('55', 34, 2, 21, 62572) But if now you withdraw from the battle, you will be supposed to have been driven from it by fear.
('55', 34, 2, 22, 62671) If it were part of your duty to flee in the face of danger, disgrace would not matter, but if you retire from battle now, you will have failed to discharge your duty, and people will be justified in condemning your flight.
('55', 34, 2, 23, 62894) Thus far, I have tried to reason out things, draw a distinction between the body and the soul and remind you of your duty as a warrior.
('55', 34, 2, 24, 63030) But let me now explain karmayoga (the method of action).
('55', 34, 2, 25, 63087) A practitioner of karmayoga never comes to harm.
('55', 34, 2, 26, 63136) It has nothing to do
('55', 34, 3, 27, 63157) 1 This was sent along with Letter to Narandas Gandhi, 13/17 11 1930; vide Letter to Narandas Gandhi
('55', 35, 0, 1, 63257) 36 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 35, 1, 2, 63298) with chopping logic.
('55', 35, 1, 3, 63319) It is something to be translated into action and experience.
('55', 35, 1, 4, 63380) An ounce of practice is more profitable than tons of argumentation.
('55', 35, 1, 5, 63448) And this practice too must not be vitiated by speculation about its fruit.
('55', 35, 1, 6, 63523) Literalists perform Vedic rites directed to the acquisition of material rewards.
('55', 35, 1, 7, 63604) If one rite does not yield the expected fruit, they have recourse to another, and being disappointed once more, they take up a third.
('55', 35, 1, 8, 63738) And thus they suffer from utter mental confusion.
('55', 35, 1, 9, 63788) As a matter of fact, it is up to us to do our duty without wasting a single thought on the fruits of our action.
('55', 35, 1, 10, 63901) To fight is the duty you have to discharge at present.
('55', 35, 1, 11, 63956) Gain or loss, defeat or victory, is not in your power.
('55', 35, 1, 12, 64011) Why should you carry the needless burden of thinking about them and be like the dog who walks under a cart and imagines that it is being drawn by himself and not by the bullocks?
('55', 35, 1, 13, 64190) Defeat and victory, heat and cold, pleasure and pain come to a man in turn and he must put up with them.
('55', 35, 1, 14, 64295) Without worrying about the fruit of action, a man must devote himself to the performance of his duty with an evenness of temper.
('55', 35, 1, 15, 64424) This is yoga, or skill in action.
('55', 35, 1, 16, 64458) The success of an act lies in performing it, and not in its result, whatever it is.
('55', 35, 1, 17, 64542) Therefore be calm and do your duty regardless of consequences. On hearing all this Arjuna said: The course of conduct you have mapped out for me seems to be beyond my capacity.
('55', 35, 1, 18, 64719) Not to worry about defeat or victory, not to waste a thought on the result how can one attain such evenness of temper and steadfastness in spirit?
('55', 35, 1, 19, 64866) How does a man with such attainments behave, and how are we to recognize him? The Lord replied: O King, one who renounces all the cravings which torment the heart and derives his contentment from within himself is said to be a sthitaprajna or samadhistha (one stable in spirit).
('55', 35, 1, 20, 65145) He is unruffled in adversity, and he does not hanker after happiness.
('55', 35, 1, 21, 65215) Pleasure and pain are felt through the five senses.
('55', 35, 1, 22, 65267) Therefore this wise man draws his senses away from sense objects even as a tortoise draws in his limbs.
('55', 35, 1, 23, 65371) The tortoise withdraws into his shell when he apprehends danger.
('55', 35, 1, 24, 65436) But in the case of human beings sense objects are ready to attack the senses at all times; therefore their senses must always be drawn in, and they should be ever ready to fight against sense objects.
('55', 35, 1, 25, 65637) This is the real battle.
('55', 35, 1, 26, 65662) Some people resort to self mortification and fasting as weapons of defence against sense objects.
('55', 35, 1, 27, 65760) These measures have their limited use.
('55', 35, 1, 28, 65799) The senses do not make for sense objects so long as a man is fasting, but fasting
('55', 36, 0, 1, 65881) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 37
('55', 36, 1, 2, 65926) alone does not destroy his relish for them.
('55', 36, 1, 3, 65970) On the other hand that relish may be heightened when the fast is broken, and a man can get rid of it only with the grace of God.
('55', 36, 1, 4, 66099) The senses are so powerful that they drag a man behind them by force if he is not on his guard.
('55', 36, 1, 5, 66195) Therefore a man must always keep them under control.
('55', 36, 1, 6, 66248) This end he can achieve only if he turns his eyes inward, realizes God who resides in his heart and is devoted to Him.
('55', 36, 1, 7, 66367) One who thus looks upon Me as His goal and surrenders his all to Me, keeping his senses in control, is a yogi stable in spirit.
('55', 36, 1, 8, 66495) On the other hand, if a man is not master of his senses, he is always musing on the objects of sense and conceives an attachment for them, so that he can hardly think of anything else.
('55', 36, 1, 9, 66680) From thisattachment arises desire; and when the desire is thwarted he gets angry.
('55', 36, 1, 10, 66762) Anger drives him nearly mad.
('55', 36, 1, 11, 66791) He cannot understand what he is about.
('55', 36, 1, 12, 66830) He thus loses his memory, behaves in a disorderly manner and comes to an ignoble end.
('55', 36, 1, 13, 66916) When a mans senses rove at will, he is like a rudderless ship which is at the mercy of the gale and is broken to pieces on the rocks.
('55', 36, 1, 14, 67050) Men should therefore abandon all desires and restrain their senses, so that these do not indulge in undesirable activity.
('55', 36, 1, 15, 67172) The eyes then will look straight and that too only at holy objects; the ears will listen to hymns in praise of God or to cries of distress; hands and feet will be engaged in service.
('55', 36, 1, 16, 67355) Indeed all the organs of sense and of action will be employed in helping a man to do his duty and making him a fit recipient of the grace of God.
('55', 36, 1, 17, 67501) And once the grace of God has descended upon him, all his sorrows are at an end.
('55', 36, 1, 18, 67582) As snow melts in the sunshine, all pain vanishes when the grace of God shines upon him and he is said to be stable in spirit.
('55', 36, 1, 19, 67708) But if a man is not stable minded, how can he think good thoughts?
('55', 36, 1, 20, 67775) Without good thoughts there is no peace, and without peace there is no happiness.
('55', 36, 1, 21, 67857) Where a stable minded man sees things clear as daylight, the unstable man distracted by the turmoil of the world is as good as blind.
('55', 36, 1, 22, 67991) On the other hand what is pure in the eyes of the worldly wise looks unclean to and repels the stable minded man.
('55', 36, 1, 23, 68105) Rivers continuously flow into the sea, but the sea remains unmoved; in the same way all sense objects come to the yogi, but he always remains calm like the sea.
('55', 36, 1, 24, 68266) Thus one who abandons all desires, is free from pride and selfishness and behaves as one apart, finds peace.
('55', 36, 1, 25, 68375) This is the condition of a perfect man of God, and he who is established therein even at the final hour attains the beatitude of Brahman.
('55', 37, 0, 1, 68513) 38 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 37, 1, 2, 68554) CHAPTER III 1
('55', 37, 2, 3, 68568) Monday Morning, November 24, 1930 When Krishna had thus set forth the marks of identification for a sthitaprajna person, Arjuna received the impression that one had only to sit quiet in order to attain such a state, as Krishna had not made the slightest reference to any need for action on his part.
('55', 37, 2, 4, 68868) He therefore asked Krishna: It seems as if you hold that knowledge is superior to action.
('55', 37, 2, 5, 68958) If so, why are you urging me to this terrible deed and thus confusing my mind?
('55', 37, 2, 6, 69037) Please tell me clearly where my welfare lies. Krishna replied: O sinless Arjuna, since the beginning of time seekers have taken one or the other of two different paths.
('55', 37, 2, 7, 69206) In one of these the pride of place is given to knowledge and in the other it is given to action.
('55', 37, 2, 8, 69303) But you will find that freedom from action cannot be attained without action, that wisdom never comes to a man simply on account of his having ceased to act.
('55', 37, 2, 9, 69461) Man does not become perfect merely by renouncing everything.
('55', 37, 2, 10, 69522) Dont you see that every one of us is doing something or other all the time?
('55', 37, 2, 11, 69598) Our very nature impels us to action.
('55', 37, 2, 12, 69635) Such being the law of nature, one who sits with folded hands but lets his mind dwell on the objects of sense is a fool and may even be called a hypocrite.
('55', 37, 2, 13, 69790) Rather than indulge in such senseless inactivity, is it not better that a man should control the senses, overcome his likes and dislikes, and engage himself in some activity or other without fuss and in a spirit of detachment?
('55', 37, 2, 14, 70017) Do your allotted duty, restraining the organs of sense, for that is better than inaction.
('55', 37, 2, 15, 70107) An idler will only meet his end the sooner for his idleness.
('55', 37, 2, 16, 70168) But while acting, remember that action leads to bondage unless it is performed in a spirit of sacrifice.
('55', 37, 2, 17, 70273) Sacrifice (yajna) means exerting oneself for the benefit of others, in a word, service.
('55', 37, 2, 18, 70361) And where service is rendered for services sake, there is no room for attachment, likes and dislikes.
('55', 37, 2, 19, 70463) Perform such a sacrifice; render such service.
('55', 37, 2, 20, 70510) When Brahma created the universe, He created sacrifice along with it, as it were, and said to mankind: Go forth into the world; serve one another and prosper.
('55', 37, 2, 21, 70669) Look upon all creatures as gods.
('55', 37, 2, 22, 70702) Serve and propitiate those gods, so that being pleased they will be gracious to you and fulfil your wishes unasked. Therefore understand that whoever enjoys the fruits of the earth, without serving the people and without having first given them their share, is a thief.
('55', 37, 3, 23, 70972) 1 This was sent along with Letter to Narandas Gandhi, 21/25 11 1930; vide Letter to Narandas Gandhi, 21/25 11 1930
('55', 38, 0, 1, 71087) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 39
('55', 38, 1, 2, 71132) And he who enjoys them after having given all creatures their share is entitled to such enjoyment and is thus freed from sin.
('55', 38, 1, 3, 71258) On the other hand, those who labour only for themselves are sinners and eat the fruit of sin.
('55', 38, 1, 4, 71352) It is a law of nature that creatures are sustained by food, food production depends on the rains, and the rains descend on the earth on account of yajna, that is to say, the labour of all creatures.
('55', 38, 1, 5, 71551) There is no rain where there are no creatures, and it does rain where they are there.
('55', 38, 1, 6, 71637) All live by labour; none can remain idle and live, and if this is true of the lower forms of life, it is still more applicable to man.
('55', 38, 1, 7, 71772) Action takes its origin from Brahma and Brahma from the imperishable Brahman; therefore the imperishable Brahman is present in all kinds of sacrifice or service.
('55', 38, 1, 8, 71934) And whoever breaks this chain of mutual service is a sinner and he lives in vain.
('55', 38, 1, 9, 72016) Tuesday Morning When a man enjoys peace of mind and contentment, it may be said that there is nothing left for him to do.
('55', 38, 1, 10, 72138) He does not stand to gain by action or by inaction.
('55', 38, 1, 11, 72190) He has no personal interests to serve; and yet he must not cease to offer sacrifice.
('55', 38, 1, 12, 72275) Therefore do your duty from day to day without entertaining likes and dislikes and in a spirit of detachment.
('55', 38, 1, 13, 72385) He who acts in such a spirit enjoys the beatific vision.
('55', 38, 1, 14, 72442) Then again, if even a selfless king like Janaka reached perfection all the while working for the good of the people, how can you behave in a way different from his?
('55', 38, 1, 15, 72607) Whatever a good and great man does, common people imitate.
('55', 38, 1, 16, 72666) Take My own case for instance.
('55', 38, 1, 17, 72697) I have nothing to gain by action, and yet ceaselessly do I pour myself out in action.
('55', 38, 1, 18, 72783) Hence it is that people too go on working more or less.
('55', 38, 1, 19, 72839) But what would happen if I ceased to work?
('55', 38, 1, 20, 72882) The world would collapse if the sun, the moon and the stars ceased to move.
('55', 38, 1, 21, 72958) And it is I who set them in motion and regulate their activity.
('55', 38, 1, 22, 73022) But there is a difference between My attitude and the attitude of the common man.
('55', 38, 1, 23, 73104) I act in the spirit of perfect detachment while he harbours attachment and works in his own interest.
('55', 38, 1, 24, 73206) If a wise man like you ceased to act, others too would do the same and their minds would be unsettled.
('55', 38, 1, 25, 73309) Therefore do your duty without attachment, so that others might not cease to work and might gradually learn to work without attachment.
('55', 38, 1, 26, 73445) Man is bound to work in obedience to and in conformity with his own nature.
('55', 38, 1, 27, 73521) Only a fool thinks that he himself is the doer.
('55', 38, 1, 28, 73569) To breathe is a part of mans nature; when an insect settles upon the eye, the eyelid moves of its own accord.
('55', 38, 1, 29, 73679) And nobody says: I take in the air or I move the eyelid.
('55', 38, 1, 30, 73736) In the same manner why should not all human actions be
('55', 39, 0, 1, 73791) 40 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 39, 1, 2, 73832) performed in accordance with the qualities of nature?
('55', 39, 1, 3, 73886) Why should there be any egoism about it?
('55', 39, 1, 4, 73927) In order that a man may be able thus to act naturally and without attachment, the best thing for him to do is to dedicate all his actions to Me and perform them without egoism as a mere instrument in My hands.
('55', 39, 1, 5, 74137) When a man thus gets over selfishness, all his actions are natural and free from taint and he escapes many a trouble.
('55', 39, 1, 6, 74255) Actions then have no binding force for him.
('55', 39, 1, 7, 74299) Action being natural, it is sheer egoism to outrage nature and to claim to be inactive.
('55', 39, 1, 8, 74387) The victim of such egoism will externally appear not to act, but his mind is always active in scheming.
('55', 39, 1, 9, 74491) This is worse than external activity and has all the greater binding force.
('55', 39, 1, 10, 74567) As a matter of fact the senses feel attraction and aversion for their respective objects.
('55', 39, 1, 11, 74657) For instance the ears like to hear some things and do not like to hear other things.
('55', 39, 1, 12, 74742) The nose likes to smell the rose, and does not like to smell dirt.
('55', 39, 1, 13, 74809) This is also true of the other organs of sense.
('55', 39, 1, 14, 74857) Therefore what man has to do is not to submit to these two robbers, namely, attraction and repulsion.
('55', 39, 1, 15, 74959) If one wishes to escape their attentions, he must not go about in search of action.
('55', 39, 1, 16, 75043) He must not hanker after this today, that tomorrow and the other thing the day after.
('55', 39, 1, 17, 75129) But he should hold himself ready to render for the sake of God such service as falls to his share.
('55', 39, 1, 18, 75228) Thus he will cultivate within himself the feeling that whatever he does is in fact an act of God and not his own, and his egoism will be a thing of the past.
('55', 39, 1, 19, 75386) This is svadharma (ones own duty).
('55', 39, 1, 20, 75421) One must stick to svadharma, for it is the best for oneself at any rate.
('55', 39, 1, 21, 75494) Paradharma (anothers duty) may appear to be better, but even so it should be looked upon as dangerous.
('55', 39, 1, 22, 75597) Moksha (salvation) lies in embracing death while doing ones own duty. When Krishna said that action performed by one who is free from likes and dislikes is sacrifice, Arjuna asked: What is it that makes a man commit sin?
('55', 39, 1, 23, 75818) Very often it seems as if he were driven to sin by some outsider against his own will. Krishna replied: The slave drivers in this case are kama (desire) and krodha (anger).
('55', 39, 1, 24, 75991) These are like blood brothers.
('55', 39, 1, 25, 76022) If desire is not satisfied, anger is the inevitable consequence.
('55', 39, 1, 26, 76087) One who is the slave of desire and anger is said to be inspired by rajoguna (the quality of passion), which is mans greatest enemy and against which he has to fight day in, day out.
('55', 39, 1, 27, 76269) As dust hides a mirror, smoke suffocates a fire and the womb covers the embryo, even so anger deprives knowledge of its lustre and suffocates it.
('55', 39, 1, 28, 76415) And desire is insatiable like fire, and taking possession of mans senses, mind and intellect, knocks him
('55', 40, 0, 1, 76520) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 41
('55', 40, 1, 2, 76565) Therefore first control your senses, and then conquer the mind.
('55', 40, 1, 3, 76629) When you have done this, the intellect also will obey your orders.
('55', 40, 1, 4, 76696) For, though among the senses, the mind and the intellect, the mind is greater than the senses and the intellect is greater than the mind, the soul is the greatest of all.
('55', 40, 1, 5, 76867) Man has no idea of his own strength or soul force, and tends to believe that the senses, the mind and the intellect are not amenable to his control.
('55', 40, 1, 6, 77016) But when once he has gained confidence in soul force, everything else becomes easy as a matter of course.
('55', 40, 1, 7, 77122) And desire, anger and their countless hosts hold no terror for him who has mastered the senses, the mind and the intellect.
('55', 40, 2, 8, 77246) [NOTE.] I call this chapter the key to an understanding of the Gita, and the gist of it is that life is given us for service and not for enjoyment.
('55', 40, 2, 9, 77394) We have therefore to impart a sacrificial character to our lives.
('55', 40, 2, 10, 77460) Intellectual assent to this proposition is only the first step, but such assent and conduct in terms of that assent are bound to rid our heart of its impurities in course of time.
('55', 40, 2, 11, 77640) But what is real service?
('55', 40, 2, 12, 77666) In order to obtain the right answer to this question, restraint of the senses is essential, as it gives us a clearer and clearer vision of the God of truth.
('55', 40, 2, 13, 77823) Service rendered with selfish motives ceases to be sacrifice.
('55', 40, 2, 14, 77885) Hence the urgent need for the spirit of detachment.
('55', 40, 2, 15, 77937) When this is understood, all manner of controversies lose their meaning for us.
('55', 40, 2, 16, 78017) Did Krishna really ask Arjuna to kill his relatives?
('55', 40, 2, 17, 78070) Could such killing ever be a part of ones duty? Questions like these are set at rest for ever.
('55', 40, 2, 18, 78165) When detachment governs our actions, even the weapon raised in order to strike an enemy down falls out of our hand.
('55', 40, 2, 19, 78281) But a mere pretence of detachment serves no useful purpose.
('55', 40, 2, 20, 78341) If only we persevere in our effort, detachment may come to us perhaps the very first day, or maybe only after a thousand years.
('55', 40, 2, 21, 78469) We must not worry over the time this takes, for the effort carries within itself the seeds of success.
('55', 40, 2, 22, 78572) We must however be on our guard and make sure that it is a genuine effort, and that there is no self deception.
('55', 40, 2, 23, 78684) And this is certainly possible for us all.
('55', 40, 3, 24, 78727) CHAPTER IV 2
('55', 40, 4, 25, 78740) Monday Morning [December 1, 1930] The Lord says to Arjuna: The yoga of selfless action which I commend to you is an ancient truth; I am not propounding any new doctrine.
('55', 40, 4, 26, 78910) I have declared it to you, as you are my devoted friend, in order to heal the conflict in your mind.
('55', 40, 4, 27, 79011) Whenever goodness weakens and evil grows from strength to strength, I incarnate Myself and
('55', 40, 5, 28, 79102) 1 This note has also appeared under the date of writing in Letter to Narandas Gandhi, 24 11 1930 2 This was sent along with Letter to Narandas Gandhi, November 27/December 3, 1930; vide Letter to Narandas Gandhi, 27 11 1930 , 3 12 1930.
('55', 41, 0, 1, 79339) 42 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 41, 1, 2, 79380) protect the good and destroy the wicked.
('55', 41, 1, 3, 79421) Those who are aware of this power (maya) of Mine are confident that evil is bound to go under.
('55', 41, 1, 4, 79516) I am always by the good mans side.
('55', 41, 1, 5, 79551) He never strays from the strait and narrow path and he comes to Me at last, for he meditates on Me and hides himself in Me and thus is delivered from passion and anger and is purified by austerity and wisdom.
('55', 41, 1, 6, 79760) As a man sows, so he reaps.
('55', 41, 1, 7, 79788) None can escape from the operation of the laws I have made.
('55', 41, 1, 8, 79848) I established the four varnas (classes, not castes) by the different distribution of qualities and actions.
('55', 41, 1, 9, 79956) However I am not their author, for I do notdesire the fruits of action and have nothing to do with the merit or demerit arising therefrom.
('55', 41, 1, 10, 80095) This divine maya (course of action) is worth knowing.
('55', 41, 1, 11, 80149) All activities prevalent in the world are subject to divine laws, and yet God is not defiled by them.
('55', 41, 1, 12, 80251) Therefore He is, and also is not, their author.
('55', 41, 1, 13, 80299) And a man who does likewise and acts in a spirit of detachment without being defiled by actions and by the yearning for their fruit is sure to be saved.
('55', 41, 1, 14, 80452) In action he sees inaction and he understands at once what is wrong action.
('55', 41, 1, 15, 80528) Wrong actions are all those that are inspired by desire and cannot be performed in the absence of desire, such for instance as theft, adultery and the like.
('55', 41, 1, 16, 80685) These simply cannot be done in a spirit of detachment.
('55', 41, 1, 17, 80740) Therefore those who do the duty that lies nearest without desire and scheming for the fruit of the action may be said to have burnt up their actions in the fire of wisdom (jnana).
('55', 41, 1, 18, 80920) A man who has thus abandoned the attachment to the fruit of action is always contented, always independent.
('55', 41, 1, 19, 81028) He has his mind under control.
('55', 41, 1, 20, 81059) He gives up all his possessions.
('55', 41, 1, 21, 81092) And his activity is natural like the bodily functions of a healthy individual.
('55', 41, 1, 22, 81171) He is free from any pride or even consciousness that he is acting on his own.
('55', 41, 1, 23, 81249) He has the realization that he is a mere instrument of the divine will.
('55', 41, 1, 24, 81321) What does it matter whether he meets with success or with failure?
('55', 41, 1, 25, 81388) He is neither elated by the one, nor unnerved by the other.
('55', 41, 1, 26, 81448) All his work is done as a sacrifice (yajna), that is to say, as service to the world.
('55', 41, 1, 27, 81534) He meditates upon God in all his actions and in the end comes to Him.
('55', 41, 1, 28, 81604) There are many forms of sacrifice, the root of which lies in purity and service, such as, for instance, control of the senses, charity and pranayama (breath control) practised with a view to self purification.
('55', 41, 1, 29, 81814) Knowledge of these can be acquired from a wise teacher (guru) through humility, earnestness and service.
('55', 41, 1, 30, 81919) If anybody indulges in various activities which he thinks are yajna, without any understanding of what yajna is, he will only do harm to himself and to the world.
('55', 41, 1, 31, 82082) It is therefore necessary that all actions should
('55', 42, 0, 1, 82132) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 43
('55', 42, 1, 2, 82177) be performed intelligently.
('55', 42, 1, 3, 82205) This wisdom (jnana) is not mere book learning.
('55', 42, 1, 4, 82252) In it there is no room for doubt.
('55', 42, 1, 5, 82286) It begins with faith and ends in experience.
('55', 42, 1, 6, 82331) It enables a man to see all beings in himself and to see himself in God so that everything appears to him to be actually informed by God.
('55', 42, 1, 7, 82469) Such wisdom effects the salvation of the worst of sinners.
('55', 42, 1, 8, 82528) It releases the seeker from the bondage of action, so that he is not affected by its results.
('55', 42, 1, 9, 82622) There is nothing else in the world so holy as this wisdom.
('55', 42, 1, 10, 82681) Therefore try to obtain it with a heart full of faith in God and with the senses under control, so that you will enjoyperfect peace of mind.
('55', 42, 2, 11, 82822) [NOTE.] The third, the fourth and the following fifth chapter should be read together, as they explain to us what the yoga of selfless action (anasakti) is and what are the means of practising it.
('55', 42, 2, 12, 83019) If these three chapters are properly understood, the reader will have less difficulty in tackling what follows.
('55', 42, 2, 13, 83131) The remaining chapters deal in detail with the ways and means of achieving anasakti.
('55', 42, 2, 14, 83216) We should study the Gita from this point of view, and if we pursue this study we shall find without much trouble a solution of the problems which confront us from day to day.
('55', 42, 2, 15, 83391) This calls for daily practice.
('55', 42, 2, 16, 83422) Let everybody try it.
('55', 42, 2, 17, 83444) If for instance he is angry, let him remember the verse dealing with anger and subdue that enemy.
('55', 42, 2, 18, 83542) Supposing we heartily dislike somebody, or are impatient or gluttonous or in doubt as to whether we should do or should not do something or other, all these difficulties can be solved with the help of Mother Gita if we have faith in it and give it constant study.
('55', 42, 2, 19, 83806) Our daily recitation of the Gita as well as this series of letters is a means to this end.
('55', 42, 3, 20, 83897) CHAPTER V 2
('55', 42, 4, 21, 83909) December 9, 1930 Arjuna said: You speak highly of knowledge, so that I am inclined to think that action is unnecessary.
('55', 42, 4, 22, 84029) But then you also praise action, thus making me feel that unselfish performance of action is the thing to do.
('55', 42, 4, 23, 84139) My mind will be at peace only if you tell me definitely which of the two is better. The Lord replied: Sannyasa means knowledge and karmayoga means selfless action.
('55', 42, 4, 24, 84303) Both of them are good, but if I had to choose between the two, I should say that yoga or selfless action is better.
('55', 42, 4, 25, 84419) The man who does not hate anyone or anything, does not long for anything and is free from the pairs of opposites such as heat and cold,
('55', 42, 5, 26, 84555) 1 This note has also appeared under the date of writing in Letter to Narandas Gandhi 2 This was sent along with Letter to Narandas Gandhi, 4/9 12 1930; vide Letter to narandas Gandhi4/9 12 1930
('55', 43, 0, 1, 84749) 44 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 43, 1, 2, 84790) pleasure and pain, is a sannyasi (wise man, literally, one who renounces the world), no matter whether he is or is not a performer of action.
('55', 43, 1, 3, 84932) He easily casts off the chain that binds him.
('55', 43, 1, 4, 84978) Only the ignorant speak of wisdom and action as different, not the learned.
('55', 43, 1, 5, 85054) The fruit of both is the same; both lead to an identical goal.
('55', 43, 1, 6, 85117) Therefore he who sees them as one sees truly.
('55', 43, 1, 7, 85163) The man of pure wisdom achieves his object by merely willing it, and has no need to perform an outward act.
('55', 43, 1, 8, 85271) When the city of Mithila was on fire, others were bound to rush to it and fight the fire.
('55', 43, 1, 9, 85361) But King Janaka contributed to this fight by his mental determination only, for his servants were ready to obey his commands.
('55', 43, 1, 10, 85487) If he had run about with a water pot to quench the fire, he would only have done harm; others would have stared at him and failed to perform their own duty, or at the most would have rushed here and there with a view to the Kings safety.
('55', 43, 1, 11, 85725) But it is not given to every one of us to become a Janaka at once.
('55', 43, 1, 12, 85792) It is indeed a very difficult task to reach a Janaka like state.
('55', 43, 1, 13, 85857) Only one in a million can reach it as the fruit of service extending over many lives, and it is not a bed of roses either.
('55', 43, 1, 14, 85980) As a man goes on performing selfless action, his thought grows from strength to strength and he resorts less and less to external action.
('55', 43, 1, 15, 86118) But he is hardly conscious of this change, and he has not this change in view either.
('55', 43, 1, 16, 86204) He is devoted only to service, with the result that his power of rendering service increases to such an extent that he hardly seems to rest from service.
('55', 43, 1, 17, 86358) And finally his service is limited to thought alone, just as an object in extraordinary motion seems to be at rest.
('55', 43, 1, 18, 86474) It is obviously improper to say that such a man does nothing.
('55', 43, 1, 19, 86536) But this lofty state can, as a rule, be only imagined, and not experienced.
('55', 43, 1, 20, 86612) Hence my preference for karmayoga.
('55', 43, 1, 21, 86647) Millions derive the fruit of sannyasa (wisdom, literally, renunciation) from selfless action alone.
('55', 43, 1, 22, 86747) They would fall between two stools if they tried their hand at sannyasa.
('55', 43, 1, 23, 86820) If they take to sannyasa, it is very likely that they will become hypocrites, and as they have ceased to perform action, they are lost altogether.
('55', 43, 1, 24, 86967) But a man who has purified himself by means of selfless action, who has his mind and his senses under control and who has identified himself with all beings, loving them as himselfsuch a man stands apart from action although he is acting all the time, and is not bound by it.
('55', 43, 1, 25, 87243) He talks, he walks, he takes part in normal human activity, but his activity seems to be merely a function of his organs of sense, and he himself seems to be doing nothing.
('55', 43, 1, 26, 87416) The bodily functions of a physically healthy person are natural and spontaneous.
('55', 43, 1, 27, 87497) His stomach for instance functions independently of
('55', 44, 0, 1, 87549) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 45
('55', 44, 1, 2, 87594) him; he has not to bother about its functioning.
('55', 44, 1, 3, 87643) Similarly a spiritually healthy person, though acting through his body, is not tainted by it and may be said to be doing nothing.
('55', 44, 1, 4, 87773) Therefore a man should dedicate all his actions to Brahma (God) and perform them on His behalf, so that in spite of his activity he does not earn either merit or demerit and is untouched by either, like a lotus leaf which is untouched by water.
('55', 44, 2, 5, 88018) Tuesday Morning
('55', 44, 3, 6, 88034) Therefore a yogi (man of selfless action), performing action with the body, mind and understanding in a spirit of detachment and without egotism, purifies himself and enters into peace.
('55', 44, 3, 7, 88220) The non yogi, on the other hand, being attached to the fruit of action, is a prisoner bound by his own desires.
('55', 44, 3, 8, 88332) The yogi lives blissfully in the city with nine gates, that is, his body, having renounced all actions by his mind, and realized that there is nothing at all that he himself is doing or getting done.
('55', 44, 3, 9, 88532) The man with a purified soul does not commit sin, nor does he do any meritorious deed.
('55', 44, 3, 10, 88619) He who acts in a spirit of detachment, having destroyed his egotism and renounced the fruit of action, becomes a mere machine moving at the will and pleasure of the Master Mechanic or an instrument in the hands of God.
('55', 44, 3, 11, 88838) The question, therefore, of his earning merit or demerit does not arise.
('55', 44, 3, 12, 88911) On the other hand, the ignorant man is always counting his merit and demerit, and sinking deeper and deeper into the pit, so that in the end the only thing he has earned is demerit.
('55', 44, 3, 13, 89093) But as regards the man who destroys his own ignorance by knowledge from day to day, his spontaneous actions grow purer and purer, and appear perfect and meritorious in the worlds eyes.
('55', 44, 3, 14, 89278) He sees all things with an equal eye.
('55', 44, 3, 15, 89316) He is equi minded towards a learned and humble Brahma knowing Brahmin, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a degraded human being who is worse than a beast.
('55', 44, 3, 16, 89467) That is to say, he serves them all with equal devotion.
('55', 44, 3, 17, 89523) He does not honour any one of them or treat another with contempt.
('55', 44, 3, 18, 89590) The man of selfless action holds himself to be the worlds debtor, and he repays what he owes to everyone else and does him full justice.
('55', 44, 3, 19, 89727) Here on earth he takes the creation captive and is filled with the spirit of the Supreme.
('55', 44, 3, 20, 89817) He is not elated if anybody does something pleasant; nor is he pained if foul abuse is poured upon him.
('55', 44, 3, 21, 89921) The man attached to the world seeks happiness from outside himself.
('55', 44, 3, 22, 89989) On the other hand, he who acts in a spirit of selfless detachment discovers the spring of eternal peace in himself, having withdrawn his mind from
('55', 45, 0, 1, 90136) 46 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 45, 1, 2, 90177) external objects.
('55', 45, 1, 3, 90195) All sensual pleasures are a source of pain.
('55', 45, 1, 4, 90239) One should resist the rush of desire, anger and the like.
('55', 45, 1, 5, 90297) The selfless yogi is constantly engaged in doing good to all creatures.
('55', 45, 1, 6, 90369) His mind is free from doubt.
('55', 45, 1, 7, 90398) He is not of the world though he is in the world.
('55', 45, 1, 8, 90448) He turns his eyes inward by means of pranayama (control of breath), etc., and conquers desire, fear and anger.
('55', 45, 1, 9, 90559) He knows Me alone to be the supreme Lord of all, the Friend, and the recipient of sacrificial offerings, and enters into My peace.
('55', 45, 2, 10, 90690) CHAPTER VI 1
('55', 45, 3, 11, 90703) Tuesday Morning, December 16, 1930 The Lord said: The man who does his duty without any selfish desire for fruit may be called a sannyasi as well as a yogi.
('55', 45, 3, 12, 90860) But he who abstains from action altogether is only an idler.
('55', 45, 3, 13, 90921) The root of the matter is that one should not allow his mind to flit from one object of desire to another and from that to a third.
('55', 45, 3, 14, 91053) He who would practise yoga, i.e., evenness of temper (samatvam), cannot but perform action.
('55', 45, 3, 15, 91145) The man who has achieved such evenness of temper will be serene, because his mere thoughts are charged with the strength of action.
('55', 45, 3, 16, 91277) A yogi is one who is not attached to the objects of sense or to action and whose mind has ceased to roam restlessly.
('55', 45, 3, 17, 91394) A man can be saved or ruined by himself alone.
('55', 45, 3, 18, 91441) Therefore he becomes his own friend or his own enemy as the case may be.
('55', 45, 3, 19, 91514) To one who has subdued his mind, his soul is a friend; while the soul is an enemy for him who has failed to achieve self control.
('55', 45, 3, 20, 91644) The test for self control is that heat and cold, pleasure and pain, honour and dishonour do not disturb ones inner serenity.
('55', 45, 3, 21, 91769) He is a yogi who is a man of knowledge as well as experience, who is unwavering and master of his senses and to whom gold, stone and earth seem all alike.
('55', 45, 3, 22, 91924) He regards with an equal eye friend and foe, sinner and saint.
('55', 45, 3, 23, 91987) With a view to attaining this state a man should stabilize his mind, divest it of all sensual desires, and meditate in solitude on the Supreme Self.
('55', 45, 3, 24, 92136) It is not enough to practise yogic asanas (postures), etc.
('55', 45, 3, 25, 92195) In order to achieve evenness of temper, one must scrupulously keep the major observances (vratas), such as brahmacharya (chastity) and the like.
('55', 45, 3, 26, 92340) A man who thus takes his place on a firm seat, keeps the observances and concentrates his mind on God, enters into perfect peace.
('55', 45, 4, 27, 92470) 1 This was sent along with Letter to Narandas Gandhi, 13/16 12 1930; vide Letter to Narandas Gandhi, 13/16 12 1930
('55', 46, 0, 1, 92585) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 47
('55', 46, 1, 2, 92630) This equanimity is not for one who overeats or merely fasts, nor for one who is too much addicted to sleep or to vigils.
('55', 46, 1, 3, 92751) Its seeker has to keep a sense of proportion in all his actions such as eating and drinking, sleeping and keeping awake.
('55', 46, 1, 4, 92872) To overeat one day and fast the next day, to oversleep for a day and keep a vigil the next, to work hard for a day and pass the next in idleness is no characteristic of a yogi.
('55', 46, 1, 5, 93049) The yogi is stable minded at all times, and is without effort free from all desires.
('55', 46, 1, 6, 93134) He is like an unflickering lamp burning in a windless place.
('55', 46, 1, 7, 93195) He is not tossed to and fro by dramatic events on the world stage or by hisown brain waves.
('55', 46, 1, 8, 93287) Such mental poise can be acquired by slow but steady effort.
('55', 46, 1, 9, 93348) The mind is fickle and restless, but it should be gradually stabilized, for a man can have peace of mind only when he is firm of understanding.
('55', 46, 1, 10, 93492) In order thus to stabilize the mind, he should constantly fix it on the soul.
('55', 46, 1, 11, 93570) He will then see all beings in himself and himself in all beings, for he will see Me in all beings and all beings in Me.
('55', 46, 1, 12, 93691) He who is absorbed in Me, and sees Me everywhere ceases to be himself, so that he is at all times attuned to Me irrespective of what he is doing, and is incapable of sin. Yoga thus described seemed to Arjuna to be a tall order, and he exclaimed: How is one to achieve such equanimity?
('55', 46, 1, 13, 93976) The human mind is restless like a monkey, and as difficult to control as the wind.
('55', 46, 1, 14, 94059) How is it to be curbed? The Lord replied: You are right.
('55', 46, 1, 15, 94116) But if a man earnestly sets about conquering attachment and aversion, yoga will not be difficult for him to practise.
('55', 46, 1, 16, 94234) But it should be clear to you that it is not for one who cannot control his mind. Then Arjuna posed another question: Supposing a man has faith, but is lax in his effort and is thus unsuccessful in perfecting himself, what happens to him?
('55', 46, 1, 17, 94473) Is he destroyed like a broken cloud in the sky? The Lord said: Such a man of faith is never lost, for no one who takes the right path ever comes to an evil end.
('55', 46, 1, 18, 94634) After death he lives for a time in some celestial world according to his merit and is then reborn on the earth into a holy family.
('55', 46, 1, 19, 94765) But such a birth is difficult to obtain.
('55', 46, 1, 20, 94806) He then regains the mental impressions developed in his former lives, and struggling harder for perfection, reaches the supreme goal.
('55', 46, 1, 21, 94940) Thus making an assiduous effort some attain equanimity soon, while others do so after a number of lives in accordance with the measure of their faith and endeavour.
('55', 47, 0, 1, 95105) 48 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 47, 1, 2, 95146) evenness of temper is superior to asceticism, to knowledge and to sacred rites, for these latter are after all only means to the end of equanimity.
('55', 47, 1, 3, 95294) Do you therefore become evenminded and a yogi.
('55', 47, 1, 4, 95341) And even among yogis hold him to be the best who dedicates his all to Me and worships Me alone in full faith.
('55', 47, 2, 5, 95451) [NOTE.] Pranayama (control of breath) and asanas (yogic postures) are referred to appreciatively in this chapter, but we should remember that at the same time the Lord has stressed the need for brahmacharya, i.e., keeping the observances calculated to take us nearer and nearer to God.
('55', 47, 2, 6, 95737) It should be clearly understood that the mere practice of asanas and the like can never take us to the goal of evenmindedness.Asanas and pranayama may be of some slight help in steadying the mind and making it single purposed, provided that they are practised to that end.
('55', 47, 2, 7, 96010) Otherwise they are no better than other methods of physical training.
('55', 47, 2, 8, 96080) They are very useful indeed as physical exercise and I believe that this type of exercise is good for the soul, and may be performed from a bodily standpoint.
('55', 47, 2, 9, 96239) But I have observed that these practices do only harm when indulged in for the acquisition of supernormal powers (siddhi) and the performance of miracles.
('55', 47, 2, 10, 96394) This chapter should be studied as a summary of the teaching in the preceding three chapters.
('55', 47, 2, 11, 96487) It cheers us up in our spiritual struggle.
('55', 47, 2, 12, 96530) We should never be down hearted and give up the endeavour to reach evenness of temper.
('55', 47, 3, 13, 96617) CHAPTER VII 2
('55', 47, 4, 14, 96631) Tuesday Morning [December 23, 1930] The Lord said: O King, I will tell you how a man who devotes his whole mind to Me, takes refuge in Me and practises karmayoga can have perfect knowledge of Me free from the shadow of a doubt.
('55', 47, 4, 15, 96859) I will declare to you this knowledge based on experience, which having been known, nothing more here remains to be known.
('55', 47, 4, 16, 96981) Hardly one from among thousands strives to acquire this knowledge, and perhaps one only of these strivers makes a success of it.
('55', 47, 4, 17, 97110) Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intellect and egoism this is the eightfold composition of My prakriti (nature).
('55', 47, 4, 18, 97228) This is the lower nature; the other is higher nature, that is, life.
('55', 47, 4, 19, 97297) This world is born of these two natures, that is to say, from the coming together of body and soul.
('55', 47, 4, 20, 97397) Therefore I am the cause of the origin and destruction of all things.
('55', 47, 4, 21, 97467) As pearls are strung on a thread, even so is the world held
('55', 47, 5, 22, 97527) 1 This note has also appeared under the date of writing in Letter to Narandas Gandhi, 13/16 12 1930 2 This was sent along with Letter to Narandas Gandhi, 18/23 12 1930; vide Letter to Narandas Gandhi, 18/23 12 1930

('55', 48, 1, 2, 97787) together by Me.
('55', 48, 1, 3, 97803) Thus I am the taste in the waters, the light in the sun and the moon, the syllable Om in the Vedas, the sound in ether, the spirit of enterprise in men, the sweet smell in the earth the brightness in fire, the life in all that lives, the austerity of ascetics, the intelligence of the intelligent, the pure strength of the strong, and the craving of all beings which does not run counter to righteousness.
('55', 48, 1, 4, 98209) In short you should understand that all that belongs to the states of sattva 1, rajas 2
('55', 48, 2, 5, 98297) and tamas 3 proceeds from Me, and depends upon Me alone.
('55', 48, 2, 6, 98354) People deluded by these three qualities (gunas) do not recognize Me Who am imperishable.
('55', 48, 2, 7, 98443) My maya made of these qualities is hard to overcome.
('55', 48, 2, 8, 98496) But those who take refuge in Me pass beyond this maya, that is, the three gunas.
('55', 48, 2, 9, 98577) Foolish evil doers cannot think of coming to Me even in their dreams.
('55', 48, 2, 10, 98647) Being steeped in illusion, they roam in darkness and do not acquire knowledge.
('55', 48, 2, 11, 98726) But the doers of good deeds worship Me.
('55', 48, 2, 12, 98766) Some of them do so in order to obtain relief in their distress; others seek for knowledge of Me.
('55', 48, 2, 13, 98863) A third group are inspired by a desire to get something for themselves while others worship Me with understanding, thinking it to be their duty.
('55', 48, 2, 14, 99008) Worship of Me means service of My creation.
('55', 48, 2, 15, 99052) This service is rendered by some because of their misery, by others in order to gain some advantage, by a third group out of curiosity as regards the outcome of such activity and by a fourth group who know what they are about and for whom service of others is something that they cannot do without.
('55', 48, 2, 16, 99351) These last are My wise devotees, dearer to Me than all the rest of them.
('55', 48, 2, 17, 99424) Or rather they know Me best and are nearest to Me.
('55', 48, 2, 18, 99475) Their wisdom is the fruit of a quest extending over a number of lives, and when they have acquired this wisdom, they see nothing in the world except Me, Vasudeva.
('55', 48, 2, 19, 99638) But those who are smitten by a variety of desires resort to other deities.
('55', 48, 2, 20, 99713) I alone, however, am the giver of rewards commensurate with the devotion of each.
('55', 48, 2, 21, 99795) The achievement too of these devotees of limited understanding is limited, but they rest content with it.
('55', 48, 2, 22, 99901) These men in their ignorance imagine that they know Me through the senses.
('55', 48, 2, 23, 99976) They do not realize that My imperishable and supreme form is beyond the reach of the senses and cannot be grasped with the hands, the ears, the nose, the eyes.
('55', 48, 2, 24, 100136) Thus the ignorant do not recognize Me though I am the Creator of all things.
('55', 48, 2, 25, 100213) This is my yogamaya (creative power).

('55', 49, 0, 1, 100321) 50 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 49, 1, 2, 100362) Pleasure and pain are the necessary consequence of likes and dislikes and keep mankind under the influence of delusion.
('55', 49, 1, 3, 100482) But those who have freed themselves from delusion and purified their thoughts and actions hold firmly to their vows and offer Me constant worship.
('55', 49, 1, 4, 100629) They know Me in the form of perfect Brahman (the Absolute) as well as of individual selves embodied as various kinds of creatures (adhyatma), and My creative action (karma).
('55', 49, 1, 5, 100803) Those who thus know Me as the One who governs the material (adhibhuta) and the divine (adhidaiva) aspects and the sacrifices (adhiyajna) and have attained evenness of temper, are released from the bondage of birth and death after they have died.
('55', 49, 1, 6, 101049) Because they have acquired the knowledge of reality their mind ceases to dwell on trivialities; they see the whole universe to be filled with the spirit of God and are absorbed in Him.
('55', 49, 2, 7, 101234) CHAPTER VIII 1
('55', 49, 3, 8, 101249) Monday Morning, December 29, 1930 Arjuna asked: You spoke of Brahman (the Absolute), adhyatma, karma, adhibhuta, adhidaive and adhiyajna, but I do not understand the meaning of all these words.
('55', 49, 3, 9, 101443) Again you say that at the hour of death you are revealed to those who know you as adhibhuta, etc., and have attained evenness of temper.
('55', 49, 3, 10, 101580) Please explain all this to me. The Lord replied: Brahman is the imperishable supreme aspect of God, and adhyatma is the individual soul living in the body of all beings as the doer and the enjoyer.
('55', 49, 3, 11, 101778) Karma is the process through which all beings come into existence, or in other words, the process of creation.
('55', 49, 3, 12, 101889) Adhibhuta is Myself as the perishable body, and adhiyajna is the individual soul purified through sacrifice.
('55', 49, 3, 13, 101998) Thus whether as the body or as the foolish soul or as the purified soul or as Brahman, it is I who am everywhere.
('55', 49, 3, 14, 102112) And never doubt this that he who meditates on Me in all these aspects at the hour of death, forgets himself, is careful of nothing and desirous of nothing will be united with Me.
('55', 49, 3, 15, 102291) Whatever a man constantly dwells on in his mind and remembers at the time of death is realized by him.
('55', 49, 3, 16, 102394) Therefore at all times you should remember Me and set your mind and heart upon Me and you will surely come to Me.
('55', 49, 3, 17, 102508) You may say that it is hard thus to stabilize the mind.
('55', 49, 3, 18, 102564) But you take it from Me that one can become single minded by daily practice and constant endeavour, for as I told you just now, all embodied

('55', 50, 1, 2, 102818) beings are in the essence Myself in various forms.
('55', 50, 1, 3, 102869) For this he should prepare himself from the very first so that his mind does not go astray at the time of death, but is steeped in devotion, keeps the life force (prana) steady, and thinks only of Me as the Omniscient the Ancient, the Ruler, the subtle supporter of all and dispeller of ignorance like the sun which drives darkness away.
('55', 50, 1, 4, 103207) This supreme state is known to the Vedas as Akshara (the Imperishable) Brahman and is reached by sages who have freed themselves from likes and dislikes.
('55', 50, 1, 5, 103361) All who desire to reach it observe brahmacharya, i.e., keep body, mind and speech under control and give up all objects of sense in these three ways.
('55', 50, 1, 6, 103511) Men and women who die, having controlled the senses and uttering the sacred syllable Om and remembering Me as they depart, reach the supreme state.
('55', 50, 1, 7, 103659) Theirmind is never distracted by other thoughts, and when they have thus come to Me, they are not reborn into this painful condition.
('55', 50, 1, 8, 103793) To come to Me is the only means of breaking the vicious circle of birth and death.
('55', 50, 1, 9, 103876) Men measure time by the human span of a hundred years, and during that period do thousands of questionable deeds.
('55', 50, 1, 10, 103990) But time is infinite.
('55', 50, 1, 11, 104012) A thousand yugas (ages) make up the day of Brahma; compared with it a human day or even a hundred years of human life are as nothing.
('55', 50, 1, 12, 104146) What is the use of counting such infinitesimal measures of time?
('55', 50, 1, 13, 104211) Human life is as only a moment in the in finite cycle of time.
('55', 50, 1, 14, 104274) It is up to us therefore to think of God alone to the exclusion of all else.
('55', 50, 1, 15, 104351) How can we afford to run after momentary pleasures?
('55', 50, 1, 16, 104403) Creation and dissolution have gone on unceasingly during Brahmas day and night and will do so in future too.
('55', 50, 1, 17, 104512) Brahma who creates and dissolves beings is only an aspect of Me.
('55', 50, 1, 18, 104577) He is the unmanifested which cannot be perceived by the senses.
('55', 50, 1, 19, 104641) Beyond this unmanifested there is yet another unmanifested aspect of Mine of which I have spoken to you.
('55', 50, 1, 20, 104746) He who reaches it is not reborn, for there is no day or night so far as this is concerned.
('55', 50, 1, 21, 104837) This is a calm and immovable aspect, which can be realized only by single minded devotion.
('55', 50, 1, 22, 104928) It supports and pervades the whole universe.
('55', 50, 1, 23, 104973) It is said that one who dies in the bright half of the month during Uttarayana (the northward movement of the sun from January to July) comes to Me if he is mindful of Me at the last moment, and that he who dies in the dark half of the month during Dakshinayana (the southward movement from July to January) is reborn into the
('55', 51, 0, 1, 105300) 52 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 51, 1, 2, 105341) Uttarayana and the bright fortnight here may be interpreted to mean the path of selfless service; and Dakshinayana and the dark half of month to mean selfishness.
('55', 51, 1, 3, 105504) The path of service is the path of knowledge, and the path of selfishness is the path of ignorance.
('55', 51, 1, 4, 105604) He who treads the path of knowledge is released from the bondage of birth and death, while he who takes the path of ignorance becomes a bondslave.
('55', 51, 1, 5, 105751) After having realized the difference between the two, who would be so foolish as to prefer to walk the way of ignorance?
('55', 51, 1, 6, 105872) All men should learn to discriminate between the paths, renounce all fruits of merit, act in a spirit of detachment and discharge their duty with all their heart and soul, and thus endeavour to reach the supreme state described by Me.
('55', 51, 2, 7, 106107) CHAPTER IX 1
('55', 51, 3, 8, 106120) Monday Morning [January 5, 1931] Having described the lofty state of a yogi in the last verse of the preceding chapter, the Lord now naturally proceeds to sing the glory of bhakti (devotion).
('55', 51, 3, 9, 106312) For the yogi in terms of the Gita is neither a dry as dust man of knowledge, nor a devotee carried away by his own enthusiasm, but a selfless performer of action imbued with the spirit of wisdom as well as devotion.
('55', 51, 3, 10, 106528) So the Lord said: As you are free from hatred, I shall now tell you the secret of wisdom, a knowledge of which will contribute to your welfare.
('55', 51, 3, 11, 106672) This is the holy knowledge above all other and is easy to translate into action.
('55', 51, 3, 12, 106753) Those who have no faith in it fail to find Me.
('55', 51, 3, 13, 106800) Men cannot perceive My unmanifested form by their senses; yet it pervades the universe.
('55', 51, 3, 14, 106888) It supports the universe; the universe does not support it.
('55', 51, 3, 15, 106948) Again in a sense it may be said that all these beings are not in Me, and I am not in them.
('55', 51, 3, 16, 107039) Although I am the source of all beings and their sustainer, they are not in Me and I am not in them; for in ignorance they do not know Me and are not devoted to Me.
('55', 51, 3, 17, 107204) Know this to be My divine mystery.
('55', 51, 3, 18, 107239) But though it seems as if I am not in these beings, I am like the air moving everywhere.
('55', 51, 3, 19, 107328) All creatures pass into My nature at the end of a cycle and are reborn at the beginning of creation.
('55', 51, 3, 20, 107429) These acts are Mine, but they do not bind Me, for I act in a spirit of detachment and am indifferent as to the fruit they bear.
('55', 51, 3, 21, 107557) These events happen as such is
('55', 51, 4, 22, 107588) 1 This was sent along with Letter to Narandas Gandhi, 1/6 1 1931; vide Letter to Narandas Gandi, 1/6 1 1931

('55', 52, 1, 2, 107741) My nature.
('55', 52, 1, 3, 107752) But people do not recognize Me in such a guise and deny My existence altogether.
('55', 52, 1, 4, 107833) They entertain vain aspirations, perform vain actions and are full of ignorance, so that they can be said to partake of the nature of demons.
('55', 52, 1, 5, 107975) But those who abide in the divine nature know and worship Me as the imperishable Creator.
('55', 52, 1, 6, 108065) They are firm in their determination.
('55', 52, 1, 7, 108103) They are always striving for virtue, praising Me, and meditating on Me.
('55', 52, 1, 8, 108175) Others again believe Me to be one or to be many.
('55', 52, 1, 9, 108224) There are countless attributes of Me; therefore those who believe Me to be many think of different attributes as so many different faces of Mine.
('55', 52, 1, 10, 108370) But one and all, they are My devotees.
('55', 52, 1, 11, 108409) I am the intention to offer a sacrifice, I the sacrifice itself, I the offering made to the spirits of the fathers, I the herb, I the sacred verse (mantra), I the oblation, I the fire to which it is offered.I am the Father of this world, I the Mother, the supporter and the Grandsire, the object of knowledge, the syllable Om, Rig Veda, Sam Veda and Yajur Veda.
('55', 52, 1, 12, 108771) I am the end of the pilgrims path, the sustainer, the Lord, the Witness.
('55', 52, 1, 13, 108844) I am the shelter, the lover, the origin, the dissolution, heat and cold, being and non being.
('55', 52, 1, 14, 108938) Those who perform the rites mentioned in the Vedas do so in order to gain their fruit.
('55', 52, 1, 15, 109025) They may thus attain the world of heaven, but they have to return to the world of mortals and to die.
('55', 52, 1, 16, 109127) But if a man meditates upon Me with an undistracted mind and worships Me alone, I bear all his burdens, supply all his needs and protect his possessions.
('55', 52, 1, 17, 109281) Some others who worship other deities with faith in their hearts are victims of ignorance, but they are really worshipping Me for I am the Lord of all sacrifices.
('55', 52, 1, 18, 109444) However, they do not know Me in My comprehensive nature and therefore are unable to reach the supreme state.
('55', 52, 1, 19, 109553) Worshippers of the gods go to the world of the gods, the ancestor worshippers to the world of the fathers and those who worship the spirits go to the spirits, while those who worship Me with the right approach come to Me.
('55', 52, 1, 20, 109775) I accept the offering of love made by seekers, even if it be only a leaf or a flower.
('55', 52, 1, 21, 109861) Therefore whatever you do, do it only as an offering to Me, so that your responsibility for the good and evil results will cease altogether.
('55', 52, 1, 22, 110002) As you will have renounced all the fruits of action, there will be no more births and deaths for you.
('55', 52, 1, 23, 110104) I am the same to all beings; none is hateful or dear to Me.
('55', 52, 1, 24, 110164) But those who worship Me with devotion are in Me, and I am in them.
('55', 52, 1, 25, 110232) This is not partiality but only the natural consequence of their devotion.
('55', 52, 1, 26, 110307) Devotion indeed works wonders.
('55', 52, 1, 27, 110338) He who worships Me in utter devotion becomes a saint even if he has been a sinner.
('55', 52, 1, 28, 110421) As darkness vanishes before the sun, a man
('55', 53, 0, 1, 110464) 54 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 53, 1, 2, 110505) abandons his evil ways as soon as he comes to Me.
('55', 53, 1, 3, 110555) Therefore know for certain that My devotee shall not perish.
('55', 53, 1, 4, 110616) He becomes a man of religion and enters into My peace.
('55', 53, 1, 5, 110671) Those who are born in the so called lower castes and illiterate women, Vaishyas and Sudras who take refuge in Me come to Me.
('55', 53, 1, 6, 110796) It goes without saying that so do Brahmins and Kshatriyas who lead a holy life.
('55', 53, 1, 7, 110876) Every devotee enjoys the fruit of his devotion.
('55', 53, 1, 8, 110924) Therefore you who have been born in this unsubstantial world should worship Me and work out your salvation.
('55', 53, 1, 9, 111032) Fix your mind on Me, be devoted to Me, offer your sacrifices for My sake, prostrate yourself before Me.
('55', 53, 1, 10, 111136) And if you are intent on Me and reduce yourself to zero by attuning yourself to Me, you are sure to come to Me.
('55', 53, 2, 11, 111248) Tuesday Morning, [January 6, 1931]
('55', 53, 3, 12, 111283) We learn from this Chapter that devotion (bhakti) means attachment (asakti) to God.
('55', 53, 3, 13, 111367) This is the royal road to the cultivation of a selfless spirit.
('55', 53, 3, 14, 111431) Therefore we are told at the very beginning that devotion is the sovereign yoga and is easy to practise.
('55', 53, 3, 15, 111536) It is easy to practise if it takes hold of our heart, but hard going if it does not.
('55', 53, 3, 16, 111621) Hence it has been described as something for which we have to offer our life itself as the price.
('55', 53, 3, 17, 111719) But he who has plunged into it enjoys perfect bliss though it scares the mere spectator.
('55', 53, 3, 18, 111808) Sudhanva 1 was laughing as he lay in the boiling oil while the bystanders were seized with terror and anxiety.
('55', 53, 3, 19, 111919) The untouchable Nanda is said to have danced as he was tried by the ordeal of fire.
('55', 53, 3, 20, 112003) 2 We need not bother whether or not these are true stories.
('55', 53, 3, 21, 112063) But the fact is that a man reaches such a state of calmness and imperturbability when he is absorbed in something or other.
('55', 53, 3, 22, 112187) He forgets himself.
('55', 53, 3, 23, 112207) But who would set his heart on anything except God?
('55', 53, 3, 24, 112259) Do not prefer the bitter neem to sugarcane or the glow worm to the sun and the moon. The ninth chapter thus shows that renunciation of the fruit of action is impossible without devotion (bhakti).
('55', 53, 3, 25, 112455) Its last verse sums up the whole chapter and in a word means, Seeking nothing, give yourself utterly to Me.
('55', 53, 4, 26, 112563) 1 Son of King Hansadhwaj of Champavati in the Mahabharata.
('55', 53, 4, 27, 112622) He was thrown into boiling oil for disobeying his father who was an atheist; but he came out unscathed because of his devotion to God.
('55', 53, 4, 28, 112757) 2 Nanda was not subjected to any ordeal.
('55', 53, 4, 29, 112798) The legend is that he went up in flames as he entered the shrine.

('55', 54, 1, 2, 112909) CHAPTER X 1
('55', 54, 2, 3, 112921) Monday Morning, January 12, 1931 The Lord said: Hear once more what I say with a view to the welfare of devotees.
('55', 54, 2, 4, 113035) Even gods and great sages do not know my beginning, for the very simple reason that I am without beginning myself and am the origin of the universe including gods and sages.
('55', 54, 2, 5, 113209) The wise man who knows Me to be unborn and without beginning isliberated from all sins, for when he realizes Me as such and himself as My child or as part and parcel of Me, he overcomes the human liability to sin.
('55', 54, 2, 6, 113423) Ignorance of ones real nature is the root of sin.
('55', 54, 2, 7, 113473) As all beings derive from Me, so do the various natures distributed to them, such as for instance forgiveness, truth, joy andsorrow, birth and death, fear and fearlessness.
('55', 54, 2, 8, 113646) Those who know all these to be My glorious manifestations easily become even minded, as they cease to be egotistic.
('55', 54, 2, 9, 113762) Their heart is fixed on Me.
('55', 54, 2, 10, 113790) They dedicate their all to Me.
('55', 54, 2, 11, 113821) I am the only subject of their conversation.
('55', 54, 2, 12, 113866) They glorify Me and live in happiness and contentment.
('55', 54, 2, 13, 113921) To these loving worshippers always aware of Me I grant the power of understanding, by means of which they come to Me. Arjuna then praised the Lord: You are the Supreme Brahman, the highest Abode, and the Lord.
('55', 54, 2, 14, 114131) You yourself say that sages worship you as the First of the Gods, the Birthless, the All pervading.
('55', 54, 2, 15, 114231) O Lord, O Father, no one knows your real nature; it is known to you alone.
('55', 54, 2, 16, 114306) Now please tell me your glorious manifestations, and explain to me how I may recognize you by meditation. The Lord replied: There is no end to My divine manifestations, but I shall name the chief of these only.
('55', 54, 2, 17, 114517) I am the atman (soul) dwelling in the heart of all beings.
('55', 54, 2, 18, 114576) I am the beginning, the middle and the end of them all.
('55', 54, 2, 19, 114632) Of the Adityas I am Vishnu.
('55', 54, 2, 20, 114660) Among the lights I am the light giving sun.
('55', 54, 2, 21, 114704) Of the Maruts (windgods) I am Marichi.
('55', 54, 2, 22, 114743) Among the stars I am the moon.
('55', 54, 2, 23, 114774) Of the Vedas I am the Sama Veda.
('55', 54, 2, 24, 114807) Of the gods I am Indra.
('55', 54, 2, 25, 114831) Of the sense organs I am the mind.
('55', 54, 2, 26, 114866) Of beings I am consciousness.
('55', 54, 2, 27, 114896) Of the Rudras I am Shankara (Siva).
('55', 54, 2, 28, 114932) Of the Yakshas and Rakshasas I am Kubera.
('55', 54, 2, 29, 114974) Of the Daityas (demons) I am Prahlada.
('55', 54, 2, 30, 115013) Of beasts I am the lion.
('55', 54, 2, 31, 115038) Of birds I am the eagle.
('55', 54, 2, 32, 115063) Indeed I am even the gambling of the cheats.
('55', 54, 2, 33, 115108) Whatever, good or evil, happens in this world happens only by My permission.
('55', 54, 2, 34, 115185) Realizing this, men should give up their pride and steer clear of evil,
('55', 54, 3, 35, 115257) 1 This was sent along with videLetter to Narandas Gandhi, 12 1 1931
('55', 55, 0, 1, 115325) 56 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 55, 1, 2, 115366) for I am the dispenser of the fruits of their good and bad deeds.
('55', 55, 1, 3, 115432) You should realize that only a single fraction of Mine sustains the entire universe.
('55', 55, 2, 4, 115517) CHAPTER XI 1
('55', 55, 3, 5, 115530) Monday Morning and Afternoon [January 19, 1931] Arjuna, asking the Lord for a favour, said: O Supreme Lord, by teaching me the truth about the soul, you have dispelled my ignorance.
('55', 55, 3, 6, 115712) You are All, the Creator and the Destroyer, being Imperishable Yourself.
('55', 55, 3, 7, 115785) If possible, please let me have a vision of your divine Form. The Lord said: There are thousands of my divine forms in various colours.
('55', 55, 3, 8, 115921) The Adityas 2, the Vasus 3 and the Rudras 4all are unified in My body, as well as all things, animate and inanimate.
('55', 55, 3, 9, 116038) But you cannot see this My form with those fleshly eyes.
('55', 55, 3, 10, 116095) Therefore I give you divine sight with which to see Me. Sanjaya said to Dhritarashtra: O king, speaking thus to Arjuna, the Lord revealed to him His marvellous form which defies description.
('55', 55, 3, 11, 116286) We see a single sun in the sky every day, but supposing a thousand suns were blazing in the sky, the glory of what Arjuna saw was more dazzling than their accumulated light.
('55', 55, 3, 12, 116460) The ornaments and the weapons of that form were similarly divine.
('55', 55, 3, 13, 116526) Arjunas hair then stood erect.
('55', 55, 3, 14, 116557) And he spoke, shaking all over. Arjuna said: O God, I see everything and everybody within your body.
('55', 55, 3, 15, 116658) Brahma and Siva are there, and so are the sages and the holy serpents.
('55', 55, 3, 16, 116729) I see you with countless arms and faces, and find no beginning, middle or end.
('55', 55, 3, 17, 116808) You shine like a mass of insufferable light, and blaze like fire.
('55', 55, 3, 18, 116874) You are the ultimate foundation of the universe, the Ancient of Days, and the guardian of eternal law.
('55', 55, 3, 19, 116977) Wherever I look, I see parts of your body.
('55', 55, 3, 20, 117020) The sun and the moon are your eyes as it were.
('55', 55, 3, 21, 117067) You pervade heaven and earth.
('55', 55, 3, 22, 117097) Your splendour burns up the universe.
('55', 55, 3, 23, 117135) This world is seized with awe.
('55', 55, 3, 24, 117166) The gods, the sages, and the siddhasall are standing with clasped hands and sing your praise.
('55', 55, 3, 25, 117260) On seeing this stupendous form and brilliance I lose my nerve.
('55', 55, 3, 26, 117323) My patience and peace are gone.
('55', 55, 3, 27, 117355) O God, have mercy on me.
('55', 55, 3, 28, 117380) I see these people rush into your mouth frightful with tusks as moths fly into a

('55', 56, 1, 3, 117653) Who are you with such an awful form?
('55', 56, 1, 4, 117690) I cannot understand your ways. The Lord said: I am Time, the destroyer of worlds.
('55', 56, 1, 5, 117772) You may or may not fight, but the warriors on both the sides are bound to perish.
('55', 56, 1, 6, 117854) You are only an instrument of the divine will. Arjuna said: O God, home of all the worlds, you are the Imperishable, Being and non Being and what is beyond either of them.
('55', 56, 1, 7, 118026) You are the First of the Gods, the Ancient of Days; you are the refuge of the world.
('55', 56, 1, 8, 118111) You are the one thing which is to be known.
('55', 56, 1, 9, 118155) You are Vayu (wind), Yama (the God of Death and Judgment), Agni (fire) and Prajapati (the Creator).
('55', 56, 1, 10, 118255) Hail to you a thousand times.
('55', 56, 1, 11, 118285) Now please show me your original form again. The Lord then said: I showed My world wide Form to you, because I love you.
('55', 56, 1, 12, 118406) You have seen today something the vision of which cannot be won by Vedic or any other studies, rituals, alms or austerities.
('55', 56, 1, 13, 118531) Do not be bewildered because you have seen it.
('55', 56, 1, 14, 118578) Cast away fear, be calm and see my familiar form.
('55', 56, 1, 15, 118628) That shape of Mine which you have seen is hard to see even for the gods and can be seen only by pure devotion.
('55', 56, 1, 16, 118739) Whoever works for Me, makes Me his supreme good,becomes my devotee, frees himself from attachment and loves all beings, comes to me. NOTE.
('55', 56, 1, 17, 118878) This chapter, like the tenth; I have deliberately cut short.
('55', 56, 1, 18, 118939) This one is full of poetry and therefore should be read frequently either in the original or in translation, so that we may be imbued with the spirit of devotion.
('55', 56, 1, 19, 119102) Whether we are or not thus imbued can be found by applying the acid test mentioned in the last verse.
('55', 56, 1, 20, 119204) Devotion is impossible in the absence of total self surrender and all embracing love.
('55', 56, 1, 21, 119290) Self surrender and a sense of solidarity with all living beings become easy of attainment if we meditate on God as world destroying time into whose gaping mouths the universe rushes to its doom.
('55', 56, 1, 22, 119485) This fate is bound to overtake us too all of a sudden, whether we wish for it or not.
('55', 56, 1, 23, 119571) Thus all distinctions of small and big, high and low, man and woman, men and the lower animals, disappear.
('55', 56, 1, 24, 119678) Seeing that we are all a mere morsel in the mouth of God as the Destroyer, we should become humble and reduce ourselves to zero and cultivate friendship with everyone else.
('55', 56, 1, 25, 119851) If we do this, we shall cease to be afraid of this terrible Form of God.
('55', 56, 1, 26, 119924) On the other hand it will give us peace of mind.

('55', 57, 1, 2, 120014) CHAPTER XII 1
('55', 57, 2, 3, 120028) Tuesday Morning, November 4, 1930 Arjuna asks the Lord: Some devotees adore a personal (sakara) God while others worship the Absolute (nirakara).
('55', 57, 2, 4, 120174) Which of these two courses is better? The Lord replies: Those who fix their minds on Me (as the One Life in all) with perfect faith and are absorbed in Me are My devotees indeed.
('55', 57, 2, 5, 120353) But those who worship the Absolute and restrain and subdue their senses are equiminded towards all living beings and serve them without looking on some as of a superior and others as of an inferior gradethey also will come to Me.
('55', 57, 2, 6, 120583) Neither of these two classes of devotees is superior to the other.
('55', 57, 2, 7, 120650) But a full realization of the Absolute is almost impossible for an embodied being.
('55', 57, 2, 8, 120733) The Absolute is devoid of all attributes and thus difficult for men even to imagine.
('55', 57, 2, 9, 120818) Therefore they are all worshippers of a personal God, whether they are aware of it or not.
('55', 57, 2, 10, 120909) Do you therefore place your mind in Me (the personal God in the universal form) and offer Me your all.
('55', 57, 2, 11, 121012) If this is not possible, try to restrain the aberrations of the mind; that is to say, by observing the yamas and niyamas, and with the help of pranayama and yogic exercises, obtain control over the mind.
('55', 57, 2, 12, 121216) If even this is beyond your capacity, perform all actions for My sake, so that your delusion will be destroyed, and you will be imbued with the spirit of detachment and devotion.
('55', 57, 2, 13, 121395) If you cannot do even this, renounce the fruits of action, that is, cease to have a desire for the fruits of action, and do the task which is allotted to you.
('55', 57, 2, 14, 121554) A man can never have any say as regards the fruit of his action, as the nature of the fruit is determined by a number of independent factors.
('55', 57, 2, 15, 121696) Be you therefore a mere instrument in My hands.
('55', 57, 2, 16, 121744) I have thus described four methods, none of which is superior to the others.
('55', 57, 2, 17, 121821) You may adopt any one of the four you like.
('55', 57, 2, 18, 121865) It may seem as if the path of knowledge (hearing the doctrine, pondering over it, etc.) is easier to take than that of yamas, niyamas, pranayama, asanas, etc.
('55', 57, 2, 19, 122024) Meditation in worship is easier still and the renunciation of the fruit the easiest of all.
('55', 57, 2, 20, 122116) But the same method is not equally well suited for all.
('55', 57, 2, 21, 122172) And some seekers have to adopt all the four methods, which are inter connected.
('55', 57, 2, 22, 122252) You must become a devotee one way or other; you may take any path that leads

('55', 58, 1, 2, 122534) to this destination.
('55', 58, 1, 3, 122555) Let me tell you what the true devotee is like.
('55', 58, 1, 4, 122602) He does not hate or bear ill will to any living creature.
('55', 58, 1, 5, 122660) He looks on all with love and compassion.
('55', 58, 1, 6, 122702) He is free from the delusion of I and mine.
('55', 58, 1, 7, 122746) He reduces himself to zero.
('55', 58, 1, 8, 122774) Pleasure and pain, are equally acceptable to him.
('55', 58, 1, 9, 122824) He forgives the wrong doer even as he expects to be forgiven himself.
('55', 58, 1, 10, 122894) He is always contented with his lot, and is unshakable in his resolve.
('55', 58, 1, 11, 122965) He dedicates his intellect and mind and all to Me.
('55', 58, 1, 12, 123016) He never molests his fellow creatures; these are therefore never afraid of him.
('55', 58, 1, 13, 123096) He does not allow himself to become perturbed by the world.
('55', 58, 1, 14, 123156) He is free from exultation, sorrow, anger, fear and the like.
('55', 58, 1, 15, 123218) He seeks nothing for himself.
('55', 58, 1, 16, 123248) He is pure and skilful in action.
('55', 58, 1, 17, 123282) He renounces every undertaking.
('55', 58, 1, 18, 123314) 1 Although he is firm in his resolve, he is indifferent as regards the success or failure of his action; that is to say, he is not anxious about its result.
('55', 58, 1, 19, 123471) He is alike to friend and foe.
('55', 58, 1, 20, 123502) Honour and insult are the same to him.
('55', 58, 1, 21, 123541) He is silent and content with whatcomes.
('55', 58, 1, 22, 123582) He moves freely as if he were alone.
('55', 58, 1, 23, 123619) He has a steady mind at all times and places.
('55', 58, 1, 24, 123665) A devotee who behaves like this in faith is dear to Me. 2
('55', 58, 2, 25, 123723) CHAPTER XIII Monday Morning [January 25, 1932] The Lord said: Kshetra (the Field) is another name for the
('55', 58, 3, 26, 123829) 1 In his Letter to Narandas Gandhi, 13/17 11 1930 (vide Letter to Narandas Gandhi, 13/17 11 1930), Gandhiji had explained: The devotee renounces all undertakings.
('55', 58, 3, 27, 123992) This means the devotee will not draw up schemes of future expansion.
('55', 58, 3, 28, 124061) For example, if a merchant who deals in cloth now has any plans of selling fire wood as well in the future, or if he, having one shop only, thinks of opening five more shops, that would be arambha (undertaking) on his part, and the devotee will have none of it.
('55', 58, 3, 29, 124323) This principle is applicable to service of the nation as well.
('55', 58, 3, 30, 124386) For instance, a worker in the khadi department today will not take up cow keeping tomorrow, agriculture the day after and medical aid on the fourth day.
('55', 58, 3, 31, 124539) He will do his best in whatever has come to him.
('55', 58, 3, 32, 124588) When I am free from egoism, nothing remains for me to do.
('55', 58, 3, 33, 124646) The Lord has bound me with a cotton thread; I am His, no matter where He leads me.
('55', 58, 3, 34, 124729) I have been stabbed with the dagger of love. A devotees every activity is planned by God.
('55', 58, 3, 35, 124819) It comes to him as in the natural course of things.
('55', 58, 3, 36, 124871) He therefore rests content with, this, that or anything else (;su dsu fpr~A_ This is the meaning of renouncing all undertakings.
('55', 58, 3, 37, 125000) The devotee does not cease to work; indeed he is nothing if not a worker.
('55', 58, 3, 38, 125074) He only ceases to think needless thoughts about his work.
('55', 58, 3, 39, 125132) It is these that he has to renounce. 2 The chapters which follow are from M.M.U./II.
('55', 59, 0, 1, 125217) 60 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 59, 1, 2, 125258) human body and kshetrajna means one who knows the Field.
('55', 59, 1, 3, 125315) Understand Me as the knower of the Field in all bodies.
('55', 59, 1, 4, 125371) Real knowledge means discrimination between the Field and the knower of the Field.
('55', 59, 1, 5, 125454) The five great elements, namely, earth, water, fire, air and ether, individuality (ahamkara), intellect, the unmanifest, the ten senses 1, mind, the five sense objects, desire and hatred, pleasure and pain, sanghata (the power of combination inherent in the constituents of the body), consciousness and cohesion, these constitute the Field with its modifications.
('55', 59, 1, 6, 125818) Knowledge of these is essential, as they have to be renounced.
('55', 59, 1, 7, 125881) Wisdom is the foundation on which such renunciation can be based.
('55', 59, 1, 8, 125947) Wisdom here means and includes humility, unpretentiousness, non violence, forgiveness, rectitude, service of the teacher, purity, steadfastness, self restraint, indifference to sense objects, absence of egoism, insight into the evil of birth, death, old age, disease and pain, detachment from wife and children, hearth and home, friends and relations, equimindedness to good and bad fortune, whole hearted devotion to God, love of solitude, dislike for the enjoyment of sensual pleasures in company with others, thirst for knowledge of the soul, andat last the beatific vision.
('55', 59, 1, 9, 126525) And the reverse of this is ignorance.
('55', 59, 1, 10, 126563) Now let me tell you something about that which has to be known with a view to salvation.
('55', 59, 1, 11, 126652) That is beginningless supreme Brahman.
('55', 59, 1, 12, 126691) Brahman is beginningless because it is unborn and was there when there was nothing.
('55', 59, 1, 13, 126775) It is neither sat (existent) nor asat (non existent) but beyond them both.
('55', 59, 1, 14, 126850) But from another standpoint it can be called sat, because it is eternal.
('55', 59, 1, 15, 126923) Human beings cannot recognize it as such; therefore it is said to be beyond even sat.
('55', 59, 1, 16, 127009) It pervades the whole universe.
('55', 59, 1, 17, 127041) It may be said to have a thousand hands and feet, and though it seems to have hands and feet, it is devoid of the organs of sense for it does not need these organs.
('55', 59, 1, 18, 127206) Sense organs are transitory while Brahman is eternal.
('55', 59, 1, 19, 127260) And although being all pervasive and all sustaining, it may be said to be enjoying the qualities (gunas), it is free from them.
('55', 59, 1, 20, 127388) Where there are gunas, there is change (vikara), but Brahman is changeless.
('55', 59, 1, 21, 127464) It may be said to be outside all beings, because it is out for those who do not know it.
('55', 59, 1, 22, 127553) And it is within all
('55', 59, 2, 23, 127574) 1 The five organs of perception, viz., ears, skin, eyes, palate and nose, and the five organs of action, viz., tongue, feet, hands and the organs of evacuation and reproduction
('55', 60, 0, 1, 127751) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 61
('55', 60, 1, 2, 127796) beings as it is all pervading.
('55', 60, 1, 3, 127827) Similarly it is both moving and unmoving.
('55', 60, 1, 4, 127869) It is subtle and hence imperceptible.
('55', 60, 1, 5, 127907) It is distant as well as near.
('55', 60, 1, 6, 127938) It is undivided in the sense that it is imperishable though name (nama) and form (rupa) perish, but it also seems to be divided as we say that it is within all creatures.
('55', 60, 1, 7, 128109) It creates, preserves and destroys.
('55', 60, 1, 8, 128145) It is the light of lights beyond darkness, and the end of all knowledge.
('55', 60, 1, 9, 128218) Brahman which is planted in every heart is jneya, the one thing worth knowing.
('55', 60, 1, 10, 128297) All knowledge is a means to the end of being united with it.
('55', 60, 1, 11, 128358) Not revised.
('55', 60, 1, 12, 128371) God and his maya (nature) are both without beginning.
('55', 60, 1, 13, 128425) Modifications (vikaras) are born of maya and these give rise to various kinds of action (karma).
('55', 60, 1, 14, 128522) On account of maya, the soul experiences pleasure and pain and the fruit of merit (punya) and demerit (papa).
('55', 60, 1, 15, 128632) He who, having realized this, does his duty in a spirit of detachment is not born again in spite of his activity, for he beholds the face of God in all faces, and seeing that not a leaf moves but by the divine will, he is free from egotism, understands that he is separate from the body and that the soul, though living in the body, remains by means of knowledge unaffected like the omnipresent ether. Finished at about 2 p.m.
('55', 60, 2, 16, 129059) CHAPTER XIV 1
('55', 60, 3, 17, 129073) Silence Day, January 25, 1932
('55', 60, 4, 18, 129103) The Lord said: Once more I will teach you that supreme wisdom which enabled sages to reach the highest perfection.
('55', 60, 4, 19, 129218) People who find that wisdom and do their duty accordingly are delivered from the cycle of births and deaths.
('55', 60, 4, 20, 129327) O Arjuna, know Me to be the Father and Mother of all beings.
('55', 60, 4, 21, 129388) The three gunas born of nature, viz., sattva (goodness), rajas (passion) and tamas (ignorance) bind the soul down.
('55', 60, 4, 22, 129503) They may be described respectively as the highest, the middling and the lowest.
('55', 60, 4, 23, 129583) Of these sattva is pure and unsullied and gives light; it is therefore the source of happiness.
('55', 60, 4, 24, 129679) Rajas arises from attachment and craving and makes a man indulge in all manner of activities.
('55', 60, 4, 25, 129773) Tamas is rooted in ignorance and delusion and makes one negligent and indolent.
('55', 60, 4, 26, 129853) In short, sattva makes for happiness, rajas for restlessness and tamas for sloth.
('55', 60, 4, 27, 129935) Sometimes sattva prevails, overpowering rajas and tamas; at other times rajas prevails,
('55', 60, 5, 28, 130023) 1 This was sent along with Letter to Narandas Gandhi, 23/25 1 1932; vide Letter to Narandas Gandhi, 23/25 1 1932
('55', 61, 0, 1, 130136) 62 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 61, 1, 2, 130177) overpowering sattva and tamas; at still other times tamas prevails, overpowering sattva and rajas.
('55', 61, 1, 3, 130276) When the light of wisdom shines through all the activities of the body it may be known that sattva is increasing.
('55', 61, 1, 4, 130390) Where greed, bustle, unrest and competition are observed, rajas is the ruler.
('55', 61, 1, 5, 130468) And the predominance of tamas is characterized by ignorance, sloth and delusion.
('55', 61, 1, 6, 130549) If sattva prevails in a mans life, he is born in the sinless worlds of the great sages after death.
('55', 61, 1, 7, 130649) If rajas dominates his life, he is born among those who are attached to action.
('55', 61, 1, 8, 130729) And if tamas is the ruling principle, he returns to the womb of the senseless.
('55', 61, 1, 9, 130808) The fruit of sattvik action is purity, while the fruit of rajas is pain and the fruit of tamas is ignorance.
('55', 61, 1, 10, 130917) A sattvik man rises to the higher regions; a rajasik person remains in this world, while a tamasik individual sinks to the underworld.
('55', 61, 1, 11, 131052) When a man perceives no doer of action other than these qualities and knows Me who am beyond them he enters into My nature.
('55', 61, 1, 12, 131176) When the dweller in the body has overcome the three qualities from which all bodies arise, he is freed from birth and death, old age and pain and drinks the nectar of eternal life. On hearing that one who transcends the qualities makes such great progress on the pilgrims path, Arjuna asked: What are the marks of such perfection?
('55', 61, 1, 13, 131507) How does such a perfect being conduct himself?
('55', 61, 1, 14, 131554) And how does he cross over the qualities?The Lord replied: A man is said to have risen above the qualities when he is not angry if the light and knowledge of sattva or the activity and bustle of rajas or the delusion and ignorance of tamas are there and is not wishful if they are not.
('55', 61, 1, 15, 131840) He sits like one who is unconcerned and is not disturbed by the qualities.
('55', 61, 1, 16, 131915) He stands apart unmoved, being aware that they are the doers of all actions.
('55', 61, 1, 17, 131992) He is even minded to pleasure and pain as well as to a lump of earth, a stone and gold.
('55', 61, 1, 18, 132080) The pleasant and the unpleasant are alike to him.
('55', 61, 1, 19, 132130) He is unaffected by either praise or blame.
('55', 61, 1, 20, 132174) He is the same in honour and evil fame.
('55', 61, 1, 21, 132214) He is alike to friend and foe.
('55', 61, 1, 22, 132245) And he has abandoned all undertakings.
('55', 61, 1, 23, 132284) Do not think that this is a goal you can never reach and that therefore you need not exert yourself.
('55', 61, 1, 24, 132385) What I have described is the state of a perfect man.
('55', 61, 1, 25, 132438) The way to it is to serve Me with single minded devotion.
('55', 61, 1, 26, 132496) From the third chapter onwards I have pointed out that a man cannot so much as even breathe without action (karma), from which no human being can ever hope to escape.
('55', 61, 1, 27, 132663) He who would transcend the qualities should dedicate all his actions to Me, and cease to desire their fruits.
('55', 61, 1, 28, 132773) If he does this, his actions will not be an impediment to his progress, for I am Brahman, moksha, the eternal dharma and joy for
('55', 62, 0, 1, 132902) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 63
('55', 62, 1, 2, 132947) When a man reduces himself to zero, he sees Me alone everywhere.
('55', 62, 1, 3, 133012) He is guna atita (one who has transcended the qualities).
('55', 62, 2, 4, 133070) CHAPTER XV 1
('55', 62, 3, 5, 133083) Night, January 31, 1932 2
('55', 62, 4, 6, 133109) The Lord said: This world is like an ashvattha (sacred fig) tree with roots above and branches below and with the Vedic hymns as its leaves.
('55', 62, 4, 7, 133250) And he who knows it knows the Vedas.
('55', 62, 4, 8, 133287) The branches of this cosmic tree nourished by the qualities shoot to heaven and sink to earth.
('55', 62, 4, 9, 133382) Sense objects are its sprouts.
('55', 62, 4, 10, 133413) It is these things of the senses which bind the soul with the bonds of karma in the world of men.
('55', 62, 4, 11, 133511) The real nature of this tree cannot be known here, nor its beginning, nor end, nor foundation.
('55', 62, 4, 12, 133606) This strongly rooted cosmic tree should be cut down with the weapon of non co operation, so that the soul may rise to a higher world from which there is no return [to the world of mortals].
('55', 62, 4, 13, 133796) With this end in view a man should engage himself in the constant worshipof the Ancient of Days, from whom all this activity (the cosmic process) seems to flow.
('55', 62, 4, 14, 133957) The wise man who is free from pride and delusion, victorious over the vice of attachment and devoted to the Supreme Soul, who is free from cravings and to whom pleasure and pain are alikethat wise man reaches the state which is beyond all change, and which does not need to be illumined by the sun, the moon or fire.
('55', 62, 4, 15, 134274) That is my Supreme abode.
('55', 62, 4, 16, 134300) An eternal part of Myself tansformed into the individual soul in this world draws to itself the senses including the mind which reside in matter.
('55', 62, 4, 17, 134446) When the soul enters the body or leaves it, it takes these senses with it even as the wind carries fragrance from its places.
('55', 62, 4, 18, 134572) It enjoys sense objects with the help of the ear, the eye, the senses of touch and taste, the nose and the mind.
('55', 62, 4, 19, 134685) The ignorant cannot recognize it as it goes or stays or enjoys itself under the influence of the qualities, but the sages see it [with the eye of wisdom].
('55', 62, 4, 20, 134840) Striving yogis see it living in their own bodies, but those who have not achieved evenness of temper cannot see it even if they try.
('55', 62, 4, 21, 134973) The light of the sun that illumines all the world, that which is in the moon and in fire

('55', 63, 1, 3, 135295) Permeating the soil 1 I sustain all living beings.
('55', 63, 1, 4, 135346) I become the sapproducing moon and feed the plants.
('55', 63, 1, 5, 135398) Becoming the fire of life in the bodies of all living creatures and being united with the life breaths, I digest the four kinds of food.
('55', 63, 1, 6, 135535) I abide in all hearts.
('55', 63, 1, 7, 135558) From Me are memory and wisdom as well as their absence.
('55', 63, 1, 8, 135614) I am that which is to be known by all the Vedas.
('55', 63, 1, 9, 135663) So also I am the Author of Vedanta and the Knower of the Vedas.
('55', 63, 1, 10, 135727) There may be said to be two kinds of personalities in this world, namely, kshara (the perishable) and akshara (the imperishable).
('55', 63, 1, 11, 135857) The perishable is all beings; and the imperishable is I who am the same for ever.
('55', 63, 1, 12, 135939) But beyond either is the highest spirit who is called the Supreme Soul, and who, pervading all, sustains the three worlds.
('55', 63, 1, 13, 136062) This too is I. I therefore transcend the perishable and even the imperishable, and am known in the world as well as in the Vedas as the Supreme Reality.
('55', 63, 1, 14, 136215) The wise man who recognizes Me as such knows all that need be known, and serves Me with his whole being.
('55', 63, 1, 15, 136320) O sinless Arjuna, I have told you this most secret teaching.
('55', 63, 1, 16, 136381) By knowing this a man becomes truly wise and reaches the shores of salvation.
('55', 63, 2, 17, 136459) CHAPTER XVI 2
('55', 63, 3, 18, 136473) February 7, I 932 The Lord said: I will now point out the distinction between the divine and the demoniacal natures.
('55', 63, 3, 19, 136590) I have earlier described at length what is meant by divine nature but I will repeat its distinctive features.
('55', 63, 3, 20, 136700) Among the signs of the divine are fearlessness, purity of heart, wisdom, evenness of temper, self control, alms giving, sacrifice, study of the scriptures, austerity, straightforwardness, non violence, truth, freedom from anger, renunciation, peacefulness, not speaking evil of others, compassion to all living beings, absence of greed, gentleness, modesty, absence of fickleness, vigour, forgiveness, fortitude, purity, internal as well as external, freedom from malice and pride.
('55', 63, 3, 21, 137182) Among the signs of the demoniacal are hypocrisy, arrogance, conceit, anger, cruelty and ignorance.
('55', 63, 3, 22, 137281) The divine nature leads to liberation while the demoniacal

('55', 64, 1, 2, 137535) leads to bondage.
('55', 64, 1, 3, 137553) O Arjuna, you are born with endowments of the divine nature.
('55', 64, 1, 4, 137614) I will say something more about the demoniacal nature, so that people may easily give it up.
('55', 64, 1, 5, 137707) Men of such a nature do not know what to do and what to refrain from doing.
('55', 64, 1, 6, 137783) There is no purity or truth in them, so that they do not observe the rules of good conduct.
('55', 64, 1, 7, 137875) They hold that the world is unreal, without basis or rule.
('55', 64, 1, 8, 137934) For them sex is all the world so that they think of nothing except enjoyment of the objects of sense.
('55', 64, 1, 9, 138036) They do horrible deeds.
('55', 64, 1, 10, 138060) They are dull witted.
('55', 64, 1, 11, 138082) They hold fast to their wicked thoughts and all their activity is directed only to the destruction of the world.
('55', 64, 1, 12, 138195) Their desires are insatiable.
('55', 64, 1, 13, 138225) They are full of hypocrisy, pride and arrogance.
('55', 64, 1, 14, 138274) They are thus plagued by innumerable cares.
('55', 64, 1, 15, 138318) They want fresh sensual pleasures every day.
('55', 64, 1, 16, 138363) They are ensnared in nooses of a hundred idle hopes, and by unlawful means amass wealth in order to gratify their desires.
('55', 64, 1, 17, 138486) I got this today; I will get that tomorrow.
('55', 64, 1, 18, 138530) I killed this one enemy today; I will also kill others.
('55', 64, 1, 19, 138586) I am a man of might.
('55', 64, 1, 20, 138607) I have great possessions.
('55', 64, 1, 21, 138633) Who is my equal?
('55', 64, 1, 22, 138650) With a view to fame I will sacrifice to the gods, give alms and make merry. They say this to themselves with a chuckle, and being caught in the net of delusion, go to hell at last.
('55', 64, 1, 23, 138831) Men with such a nature, given over to pride, speak ill of others and thus hate God who dwells in all hearts.
('55', 64, 1, 24, 138940) They are therefore frequently born in the wombs of degraded parents.
('55', 64, 1, 25, 139009) There are three gates to hell, leading to the ruin of the soul: lust, anger and greed.
('55', 64, 1, 26, 139096) Therefore we should renounce them all.
('55', 64, 1, 27, 139135) Turning aside from them, men go by the strait and narrow path and reach the highest state.
('55', 64, 1, 28, 139226) He who disregards the scriptures composed of eternal principles and gives himself up to pleasure cannot attain happiness or peace characteristic of the right way.
('55', 64, 1, 29, 139389) Therefore in deciding what you must do and what you must not do, you should acquire the knowledge of fundamental and immutable principles from wise men and think and act accordingly.
('55', 65, 0, 1, 139572) 66 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 65, 1, 2, 139613) CHAPTER XVII 1
('55', 65, 2, 3, 139628) February 14, 1932 Arjuna asked: What happens to those who serve in faith, neglecting the prevailing code of conduct? The Lord replied: There are three kinds of faith, characterized by sattva, rajas or tames as the case may be.
('55', 65, 2, 4, 139855) As is a mans faith, so is he.
('55', 65, 2, 5, 139885)  Sattvik men worship the gods; rajasik men worship demigods and demons; and tamasik men worship the spirits of the dead.
('55', 65, 2, 6, 140006) The nature of a mans faith cannot be ascertained offhand.
('55', 65, 2, 7, 140064) In order to assess it correctly, one must know the precise nature of his food, austerity, sacrifice and alms giving.
('55', 65, 2, 8, 140181) Foods which make for long life and increase the vital force, energy, strength and health are said to be sattvik.
('55', 65, 2, 9, 140294) Rajasik foods are violently bitter, sour, hot or pungent and give rise to disease and aches and pains.
('55', 65, 2, 10, 140397) And cooked food which is stale or gives out a bad smell and the leavings of others are said to be tamasik.
('55', 65, 2, 11, 140504) The sacrifice which is offered as a matter of duty without expecting a reward and with mental concentration is said to be sattvik.
('55', 65, 2, 12, 140635) A rajasik sacrifice is that in which a reward is desired and which is offered for outward show.
('55', 65, 2, 13, 140731) And a tamasik sacrifice is one in which scriptural rules are disobeyed, no eatables or alms are given away and no hymns are chanted.
('55', 65, 2, 14, 140864) Honouring the saintly purity, brahmacharya and non violence constitute austerity of the body.
('55', 65, 2, 15, 140958) Truthful, pleasant and beneficial speech as well as a study of the scriptures is austerity of speech.
('55', 65, 2, 16, 141060) Andcheerfulness, gentleness, silence, self control and purity of motivethese are called austerity of the mind.
('55', 65, 2, 17, 141171) Such austerity of the mind, body and speech as is practised without desire of fruit by men with an evenness of temper is said to be sattvik.
('55', 65, 2, 18, 141312) Austerity practised for ostentation and with a view to gaining honour is said to be rajasik.
('55', 65, 2, 19, 141405) And austerity done by obstinate fools with self torture or with the object of hurting others is said to be tamasik.
('55', 65, 2, 20, 141521) A gift made in due place, due time and to a fit recipient without expecting a reward and with a feeling that it is right for a man to give is said to be sattvik.
('55', 65, 2, 21, 141683) A gift made grudgingly with a view to
('55', 65, 3, 22, 141721) 1 This was sent along with Letter to Narandas Gandhi, 11/15 2 1932; vide Letter to Narandas Gandhi, 11/15 2 1932
('55', 66, 0, 1, 141834) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 67
('55', 66, 1, 2, 141879) getting something in return is regarded as rajasik.
('55', 66, 1, 3, 141931) And the gift which is given in a contemptuous spirit, and without honour done to the recipient and without considering the proper time and place for it is said to be tamasik.
('55', 66, 1, 4, 142106) Brahman is designated in the Vedas as Om tat sat.
('55', 66, 1, 5, 142156) Therefore men of faith pronounce the sacred syllable Om when they commence any rite of sacrifice, alms giving or austerity.
('55', 66, 1, 6, 142280) This single syllable stands for Brahman.
('55', 66, 1, 7, 142321) Tat means that.
('55', 66, 1, 8, 142337) And sat means satya, beneficient.
('55', 66, 1, 9, 142371) That is to say, God is one, He alone is, He alone is truth and the benefactor of the world.
('55', 66, 1, 10, 142463) He who offers a sacrifice, makes gifts or practises austerity with a realization of this truth and in a spirit of dedication is a man of sattvik faith.
('55', 66, 1, 11, 142615) And he is free from blame if he knowingly or unknowingly does something different from the correct procedure in the spirit of dedication.
('55', 66, 1, 12, 142753) But acts undertaken in the absence of such a spirit are said to be performed without faith and therefore are asat (unreal).
('55', 66, 2, 13, 142877) CHAPTER XVIII 1
('55', 66, 3, 14, 142893) February 21, 1932
('55', 66, 4, 15, 142911) Even after he had pondered over the teaching in all the previous Chapters, there was still a doubt in Arjunas mind.
('55', 66, 4, 16, 143027) So he said: The sannyasa of the Gita seems to be different from renunciation as currently understood.
('55', 66, 4, 17, 143129) Are sannyasa and tyaga really different? While resolving Arjunas doubt in answer to this question, the Lord summarized the Gita doctrine in a concise manner: Some actions are motivated by desire.
('55', 66, 4, 18, 143325) Various activities are indulged in by men with a view to fulfilling various desires.
('55', 66, 4, 19, 143410) These are called kamya actions.
('55', 66, 4, 20, 143442) Then again there are certain necessary and natural actions such as breathing, eating, drinking, Iying down, sitting, etc., with aview to keep the body [a fit instrument of service].
('55', 66, 4, 21, 143624) And thirdly there are actions done with a view to serving others.
('55', 66, 4, 22, 143690) Giving up kamya actions is sannyasa, and renunciation of fruits of all actions is tyaga as recommended to you all along.
('55', 66, 4, 23, 143811) Some people maintain that there is evil, no matter how little, in all actions whatever.
('55', 66, 4, 24, 143899) Even so, a man must not give up actions done with a view to yajna (sacrifice), that is to say, the service of others.
('55', 66, 4, 25, 144017) Alms giving and austerity are included in yajna.
('55', 66, 4, 26, 144066) But even while
('55', 66, 5, 27, 144081) 1 This was sent along with Letter to Narandas Gandhi, 19/21 2 1932; vide Letter to Narandas Gandhi, 19/21 2 1932
('55', 67, 0, 1, 144194) 68 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 67, 1, 2, 144235) serving others, a man should act in a spirit of detachment.
('55', 67, 1, 3, 144295) Otherwise his activity is likely to be mixed up with evil.
('55', 67, 1, 4, 144354) Renunciation owing to ignorance of duties that must be done is said to be inspired by tamas.
('55', 67, 1, 5, 144447) Giving up any action merely because it involves physical suffering is said to be rajasik.
('55', 67, 1, 6, 144537) But service rendered to others because of a feeling that it must be done and without the desire for the fruits is real sattvik tyaga.
('55', 67, 1, 7, 144671) In this tyaga therefore there is no giving up of all actions, but only of the fruit of duties that must be done, and of course of other, that is, kamya actions.
('55', 67, 1, 8, 144832) When a [wise] man acts in such a selfless spirit, all his doubts are dispelled, his motives are pure and he has no thought of personal comfort and discomfort.
('55', 67, 1, 9, 144991) He who does not abandon the fruits of action must enjoy or put up with the natural consequences of his own acts, and is thus a bondslave for ever.
('55', 67, 1, 10, 145138) But he who gives up the fruits of action achieves freedom.
('55', 67, 1, 11, 145197) And why should a man feel attachment for action?
('55', 67, 1, 12, 145246) It is idle for anybody to imagine that he himself is a doer.
('55', 67, 1, 13, 145307) There are five causes for the accomplishment of all actions, namely, this body, the doer, the various instruments, efforts, and last but by no means the least, providence.
('55', 67, 1, 14, 145479) Realizing this, a man should give up pride.
('55', 67, 1, 15, 145523) He who does something without egoism may be said to be not doing it in spite of his doing it, for he is not bound by his action.
('55', 67, 1, 16, 145652) Of a humble man who has reduced himself to zero it may be said that he does not kill though he kills.
('55', 67, 1, 17, 145754) This does not mean that the man in spite of his humility may kill and yet be unaffected by the killing.
('55', 67, 1, 18, 145858) For no occasion can arise for such a man to indulge in violence.
('55', 67, 1, 19, 145923) There are three things that inspire action: knowledge, the object of knowledge and the knower.
('55', 67, 1, 20, 146018) And there are three constituents of action: the organ, the deed and the doer.
('55', 67, 1, 21, 146096) The thing to be done is the object of knowledge; the method of doing it is knowledge and he who knows it is the knower.
('55', 67, 1, 22, 146216) After he has thus received an impulse toaction, he performs an action in which the senses serve as instruments.
('55', 67, 1, 23, 146328) Thought is thus translated into action.
('55', 67, 1, 24, 146368) That by which a man is able To see one changeless Life in all the lives and to realize the essential unity that underlies all diversities is sattvik knowledge.
('55', 67, 1, 25, 146528) In rajasik knowledge one holds that there are different souls in different creatures, while in tamasik knowledge a
('55', 68, 0, 1, 146643) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 69
('55', 68, 1, 2, 146688) man does not know a thing and imagines that everything is mixed up without rhyme or reason.
('55', 68, 1, 3, 146780) Similarly there are three kinds of action.
('55', 68, 1, 4, 146823) Action in which there are no likes and dislikes and no desire for personal gains is sattvik.
('55', 68, 1, 5, 146916) That in which there are desires for enjoyment, egoism and restlessness is rajasik action.
('55', 68, 1, 6, 147006) And tamasik action is one in which no thought at all is given to personal capacity and consequential injury or violence and which is undertaken through delusion.
('55', 68, 1, 7, 147168) So also there are three classes of doers.
('55', 68, 1, 8, 147210) Of course having understood the action it could not be difficult to know the doer.
('55', 68, 1, 9, 147293) A sattvik doer is free from attachment and egoism and yet firm and enterprising and is neither elated by success nor worried by failure.
('55', 68, 1, 10, 147430) A rajasik doer is impassioned, greedy and violent, slave by turns of sorrow and of joy and of course desires to obtain the fruit of his actions.
('55', 68, 1, 11, 147575) And a tamasik doer is unsystematic, procrastinating, obstinate, malicious and indolent; in short, without an iota of self culture.
('55', 68, 1, 12, 147706) Intellect, firmness and happiness also are said to be of three kinds.
('55', 68, 1, 13, 147776) The sattvik intellect is able properly to distinguish between action and non action,
('55', 68, 2, 14, 147861) What must be done, and what must not be done, What should be feared, and what should not be feared, What binds and what emancipates the soul.
('55', 68, 2, 15, 148003) The rajasik intellect tries to draw these distinctions but generally fails to do so correctly, while the tamasik intellect looks upon wrong as right and sees all things contrariwise of truth. Firmness is the power of taking up some thing and sticking to it through thick and thin.
('55', 68, 2, 16, 148284) It is more or less inherent in all things; otherwise the world could not subsist for a single moment.
('55', 68, 2, 17, 148386) Firmness is sattvik when there is a constantly maintained balance between the activities of the mind, the vital airs (pranas) and the senses.
('55', 68, 2, 18, 148528) The firmness by which a man holds fast to duty, pleasure and wealth from attachment and with a view to personal advantage is rajasik.
('55', 68, 2, 19, 148662) And firmness is tamasik,
('55', 68, 3, 20, 148687) wherewith the fool Cleaves to his sloth, his sorrow and his fears, His vanity and despair.
('55', 68, 3, 21, 148778)  Sattvik happiness is the
('55', 68, 4, 22, 148804) pleasure that endures, Banishing pain for aye, bitter at first
('55', 69, 0, 1, 148867) 70 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 69, 1, 2, 148908) As poison to the soul, but afterwards Sweet as the taste of amrit.
('55', 69, 1, 3, 148975) It arises from true self knowledge.
('55', 69, 1, 4, 149011)  Rajasik happiness arises from sensual enjoyment.
('55', 69, 2, 5, 149061) Sweet As amrit is its first taste, but its last Bitter as poison.
('55', 69, 2, 6, 149127) And tamasik happiness is that
('55', 69, 3, 7, 149157) which springs From sloth and sleep and foolishness.
('55', 69, 4, 8, 149209) EDWIN ARNOLD This threefold classification is thus applicable to all things.
('55', 69, 4, 9, 149286) The duties of the four varnas are fixed by reason of the dominance or recession of the qualities planted in each.
('55', 69, 4, 10, 149400) A Brahmins conduct is characterized by calmness, self discipline, austerity, purity, forgiveness, uprightness, wisdom, experience and faith in God.
('55', 69, 4, 11, 149548) The characteristics of a Kshatriya are valour, splendour, firmness, resourcefulness, not flying from battle, open handedness and leadership.
('55', 69, 4, 12, 149689) A Vaishyas task is to till the ground, tend cattle, venture trade, and service is the Sudras work.
('55', 69, 4, 13, 149788) This is not to say that a member of any one of these classes may not be endowed with qualities characteristic of other classes or is not entitled to cultivate them in himself.
('55', 69, 4, 14, 149964) But qualities and work as mentioned above serve as signs for the recognition of a mans varna.
('55', 69, 4, 15, 150058) If the qualities and tasks of each varna are recognized, there is no undesirable competition or feeling of hatred among them.
('55', 69, 4, 16, 150184) There is no question here of high and low.
('55', 69, 4, 17, 150227) But if each does his duty selflessly according to his nature, he will reach perfection.
('55', 69, 4, 18, 150315) Therefore ones own duty, though it appears to be valueless, is better than the duty of another which seems to be easy.
('55', 69, 4, 19, 150434) A man may remain free from sin when he performs the task naturally allotted to him, as he is then free from selfish desires; the very wish to do something else arises from selfishness.
('55', 69, 4, 20, 150619) For the rest, all actions are clouded by defects as fire by smoke.
('55', 69, 4, 21, 150686) But the natural duty is done without desire for its fruit, and thus loses its binding force.
('55', 69, 4, 22, 150779) The calm yogi who has been sanctified by thus performing his own duty, who has his mind under control, who has given up the five sense objects, who has overcome likes and dislikes, who lives in solitude, i.e., whose eyes are turned inward, who achieves mastery of his mind, body and speech by abstemiousness, who is ever conscious

('55', 70, 1, 2, 151155) of the living presence of God, and who has given up pride, desire, anger, acquisitiveness and the likethat yogi is fit to be united with Brahman.
('55', 70, 1, 3, 151301) He is equi minded towards all men.
('55', 70, 1, 4, 151336) He neither rejoices nor indulges in grief.
('55', 70, 1, 5, 151379) Such a devotee has true knowledge of God and is absorbed in Him.
('55', 70, 1, 6, 151444) Thus taking refuge in Me, he gains the eternal place.
('55', 70, 1, 7, 151498) Therefore dedicate your all to Me, regard Me as the supreme object of your love, and with discrimination, fix your mind on Me.
('55', 70, 1, 8, 151625) As you do this, you will overcome all difficulties.
('55', 70, 1, 9, 151677) But if out of egoism you do not listen to Me, you will perish.
('55', 70, 1, 10, 151740) The one thing needful is that, abandoning all conflicting views, you should come to Me alone for shelter, and thus be freed from sin.
('55', 70, 1, 11, 151874) Do not tell this truth to anyone who is not a devotee, austere in life, and hating Me, does not wish to listen.
('55', 70, 1, 12, 151986) But one who communicates this great secret to My devotees will surely come to Me in virtue of his devotion. After having thus reported to Dhritarashtra the dialogue between Arjuna and Krishna, Sanjaya said: Where there is Krishna, the prince of yoga, and Arjuna with his bow and arrows, there are prosperity, victory, happiness and fundamental morality. [NOTE.] Krishna to whom the epithet prince of yoga has here been applied means pure knowledge based on spiritual experience, and by referring to Arjuna as an archer it is suggested that where there is action in accordance with such knowledge, the doer obtains every wish that is not contrary to lofty morals.

('55', 70, 3, 14, 152697) 50. LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI
('55', 70, 4, 15, 152727) Afternoon, February 19/21, 1932
('55', 70, 5, 16, 152759) NARANDAS, I got your post in due time.
('55', 70, 5, 17, 152798) Tell Bhai Valji that I have started reading and revising his translation 1 today.
('55', 70, 5, 18, 152880) You will of course inquire from time to time after those who are imprisoned and lodged in the Sabarmati Jail, but you should also keep yourself informed in which jails the others are lodged.
('55', 70, 5, 19, 153071) Lilavati came and saw me.
('55', 70, 5, 20, 153097) It was good of her.
('55', 70, 6, 21, 153117) 1Vide Letter to Narandas Gandhi,27 1 1932, footnote 1.
('55', 71, 0, 1, 153172) 72 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 71, 1, 2, 153213) Read my letter to Champa.
('55', 71, 1, 3, 153239) If she is willing to endure her lot and live with Ratilal, there will be no problem.
('55', 71, 1, 4, 153324) If, however, she is not willing, I think we cannot force her to live with him.
('55', 71, 1, 5, 153403) Ratilal may have to be put in the asylum again.
('55', 71, 1, 6, 153451) The whole problem is a difficult one.
('55', 71, 1, 7, 153489) Do what you think best.
('55', 71, 1, 8, 153513) In any case, keep Doctor 1 informed.
('55', 71, 1, 9, 153550) Chimanlal must take rest.
('55', 71, 1, 10, 153576) His body gives no service and no one is able to diagnose the disease.
('55', 71, 1, 11, 153646) Krishnamaiyadevi has certainly not acted properly in staying on in Calcutta.
('55', 71, 1, 12, 153723) You did well in writing to her.
('55', 71, 1, 13, 153755) Did you get Lakshmi 2
('55', 71, 2, 14, 153777) examined by a doctor for her swelling?
('55', 71, 2, 15, 153816) Is she expecting?
('55', 71, 2, 16, 153834) That can be a cause.
('55', 71, 2, 17, 153855) You should ask her or find out through Lakshmibehn.
('55', 71, 2, 18, 153907) Yajna does not merely mean work for the good of others; it also means body labour.
('55', 71, 2, 19, 153990) If men did not do body labour, that is, did not cultivate land and grow crops, the rains would stop.
('55', 71, 2, 20, 154091) My own belief is that natural phenomena are connected with moral behaviour.
('55', 71, 2, 21, 154167) I have no proof for this.
('55', 71, 2, 22, 154193) It is my faith.
('55', 71, 2, 23, 154209) Such faith can do no harm in any case.
('55', 71, 2, 24, 154248) Little research is done about such matters in the present age, and what is written about them in ancient books is treated as superstition.
('55', 71, 2, 25, 154387) It is true, of course, that they contain many superstitious ideas.
('55', 71, 2, 26, 154454) Who can sift truth from error in these books?
('55', 71, 2, 27, 154500) In the company of thieves even an honest man is taken for a thief.
('55', 71, 2, 28, 154567) That being so, we should not interpret yajna strictly but accept all possible meanings which satisfy our moral sense and connect the phenomenon of rain with yajna sounderstood.In the Gita as in other scriptures, we find one and the same word used in different senses.
('55', 71, 2, 29, 154835) Of course, all work done as yajna should be inspired with the motive of service.
('55', 71, 2, 30, 154916) Send this to Bhai Jivram.
('55', 71, 3, 31, 154942) Evening, February 21, 1932
('55', 71, 4, 32, 154969) I have just finished Chapter XVIII.
('55', 71, 4, 33, 155005) You will see that I have taken more freedom in this Chapter than in the others.
('55', 71, 4, 34, 155085) So far I used to give a simple translation, more or less, but I did not feel satisfied with that.
('55', 71, 4, 35, 155183) This time, I have given the general meaning of the Chapter, with a few comments intended to make the discussion easier to understand.
('55', 71, 4, 36, 155317) I have even omitted a few verses as unnecessary for our purpose.
('55', 71, 4, 37, 155382) I dont think, however, that I have omitted anything useful.
('55', 71, 4, 38, 155442) God willing, I will make another effort to explain the general meaning of the work

('55', 72, 6, 14, 156162) DEAR BOYS AND GIRLS, I see from Manis letter that no one undertakes to write to me on behalf of you all.
('55', 72, 6, 15, 156267) What a state of affairs is this?
('55', 72, 6, 16, 156300) What purpose would my writing serve if no one assumes responsibility for attending to the letter I address to all the children and if no one so much as even acknowledges receipt of the letter?
('55', 72, 6, 17, 156493) You should, therefore, write to me say whether you will send me a reply every week.
('55', 72, 6, 18, 156577) Do you remember what I told you about Miss Doriss school?
('55', 72, 6, 19, 156635) 2 Though the children there are under eight years of age, what a lot of work they do on their own responsibility!
('55', 72, 6, 20, 156749) Some of you are as much as sixteen years old.
('55', 72, 6, 21, 156795) Though grown up, they are counted among children.
('55', 72, 6, 22, 156845) If not all, they, at any rate, should assume all the more responsibilities.
('55', 72, 6, 23, 156921) At Phoenix, when Devdas and Prabhudas were twelve years old, they got other children to co operate with them and shouldered considerable responsibility.
('55', 72, 6, 24, 157074) They brought the mail from the post office and also went to post the letters.
('55', 72, 6, 25, 157152) They had to walk three miles through the jungle, but courageously they went.
('55', 72, 6, 26, 157229) They used to help in the printing press in a variety of ways and also fetched water from the spring.

('55', 73, 1, 2, 157559) In short, at one time Maganlal had only this batch of children to help him, and yet it was possible to cope with all the work, for the children worked as a team without sparing themselves either mentally or physically.
('55', 73, 1, 3, 157778) Think, then, how much more I would expect from you.
('55', 73, 1, 4, 157830) Send a reply to this and keep alive your association.

('55', 73, 4, 7, 157997) SISTERS, You have won, and I have been completely defeated.
('55', 73, 4, 8, 158057) I would always like that you should win and I should be defeated.
('55', 73, 4, 9, 158123) But I find it difficult to accept this defeat, for it has weakened the foundation of the Ashram.
('55', 73, 4, 10, 158220) However, though I have been defeated, Truth has won.
('55', 73, 4, 11, 158273) And what does it matter if, for the sake of Truth, thousands of [such] ashrams are reduced to ashes?
('55', 73, 4, 12, 158374) This is how it is your victory.
('55', 73, 4, 13, 158406) Several sisters believed that the friendship of .
('55', 73, 4, 14, 158456) 2 and .
('55', 73, 4, 15, 158464) 3 was not innocent.
('55', 73, 4, 16, 158484) Disregarding their view, I believed the contrary and defended them.
('55', 73, 4, 17, 158552) The womens judgmenthas proved correct and mine wrong.
('55', 73, 4, 18, 158606) The matter would have ended earlier if I had accepted your view.
('55', 73, 4, 19, 158671) But it was necessary that my capacity for judging people should be tested.
('55', 73, 4, 20, 158746) It was for my good and yours and for the good of the Ashram that it should be tested.
('55', 73, 4, 21, 158832) It was necessary that my pride should be humbled.
('55', 73, 4, 22, 158882) Let us hope that it has been.
('55', 73, 4, 23, 158912) Having known the generosity of your hearts, I ought to have heeded your warning, but I did not and you bore that too.
('55', 73, 4, 24, 159030) You did not forsake the company of a fool like me.
('55', 73, 4, 25, 159081) Personally I believe that you will lose nothing for not doing so.
('55', 73, 4, 26, 159147) Behind my folly were truth and pure love and trust in people.
('55', 73, 4, 27, 159209) God will therefore mend my mistake.
('55', 73, 4, 28, 159245) However, I will never disregard your warning in future and will learn from this bitter experience to be careful even in the smallest matters.

('55', 74, 9, 12, 159995) BHAI GHANSHYAMDAS,
('55', 74, 10, 13, 160014) I was awaiting your letter.
('55', 74, 10, 14, 160042) Yes, my health is good, so is Sardars.
('55', 74, 10, 15, 160081) I take honey and half a lemon in hot water at 4.30 in the morning, followed by one and a half tola of roasted, ground almonds and thirty dates in tomato juice at 7 oclock.
('55', 74, 10, 16, 160253) Lemon and honey in hot water is repeated at noon, and some vegetable, tomato, fifteen dates and one tola of almonds at 4 oclock.
('55', 74, 10, 17, 160382) I have started on vegetable only these two days, formerly I was taking thirty dates.
('55', 74, 10, 18, 160467) On some days I was taking papaya at four, but I can take it no longer, as vegetable constitutes the fifth article of food.
('55', 74, 10, 19, 160590) Neither is there any need for papaya.
('55', 74, 10, 20, 160628) It has been like this for about fifteen days.
('55', 74, 10, 21, 160674) Before that I used to take half a pound of milk in the morning and half a pound ofcurds in the evening, but I found milk a bit hard on digestion.
('55', 74, 10, 22, 160820) Anyway, I am always pleased to give up milk on any possible pretext; so I am off milk.
('55', 74, 10, 23, 160907) I do not know how long I can do without it.
('55', 74, 10, 24, 160951) My weight is steady at 106 lb.
('55', 74, 10, 25, 160982) Do send dates; though the ones I have are fresh and good.
('55', 74, 11, 26, 161040) They have been sent by Jerajani.You shall have to apply to Delhi or Bombay in order to visit me.

('55', 75, 6, 17, 162012) I was waiting for it.
('55', 75, 6, 18, 162034) We are both glad you are happy there.
('55', 75, 6, 19, 162072) 3 You find yourself there just when you were about to break under the strain.
('55', 75, 6, 20, 162150) I fancy that 12 oz.
('55', 75, 6, 21, 162170) 4 of milk will not be enough for you.
('55', 75, 6, 22, 162208) You should take 24 oz.

('55', 75, 7, 24, 162250) 1 A town in Michigan, known as The Health City 2 Dr. John Haynes Holmes 3 As a result of my sending abroad weekly bulletins of authentic news, regarding the Civil Disobedience movement, I had been served with a notice to quit Bombay.
('55', 75, 7, 25, 162484) As I had declined to comply, I was duly arrested, tried and sentenced to three months simple imprisonment, A class, and sent to Bombay female jail at Arthur Road.
('55', 75, 7, 26, 162647) There being no A class accommodation in the Debtors jail, which had been temporarily turned into a jail for female political prisoners, I was put with the C class prisoners for the first two nights, after which a small kitchen in the prison yard was rigged up as my cell.
('55', 75, 7, 27, 162919) But as nearly all the space was taken up by a large row of stoves, there was no room for me to sleep inside.
('55', 75, 7, 28, 163028) This was a piece of good luck as it meant I had to be allowed to wander by day amongst the other prisoners in the yard and to sleep under the sky at night, while the rest were locked up in their barrack.
('55', 75, 7, 29, 163232) It may be mentioned that the C class political prisoners were mostly well educated women, used to a high standard of living, certainly higher than the Ashram standard.
('55', 75, 7, 30, 163400) But the Bombay Government was particularly severe in its classification, Ba, Mrs. Naidu and myself being, as far as I can remember, the only women given A class in the whole Province.
('55', 75, 7, 31, 163584) A few were given B class and all the rest C.

('55', 76, 1, 9, 164209) I would like you to read Dutts abridged metrical rendering of the Mahabharata and Ramayana, Arnolds Indian Idylls and Pearls of the Faith.
('55', 76, 1, 10, 164348) You should induce your companions to take to spinning and carding if they have time given to them for that class of labour.
('55', 76, 1, 11, 164472) You should be able to do a great deal of Hindi there.
('55', 76, 1, 12, 164526) But no overstraining on any account.
('55', 76, 1, 13, 164563) You have this precious and unsought leisure.

('55', 76, 1, 15, 164756) which is very good.
('55', 76, 1, 16, 164776) You need have therefore no anxiety on that score.

('55', 77, 1, 2, 165318) 57. LETTER TO PREMABEHN KANTAK
('55', 77, 2, 3, 165349) February 25, 1932
('55', 77, 3, 4, 165367) PREMA, I got your letter.
('55', 77, 3, 5, 165393) You want from me inspired utterances which would touch the heart.
('55', 77, 3, 6, 165459) If I had a safe filled with them, I would open it and send some every week.
('55', 77, 3, 7, 165535) But I have no such safe.
('55', 77, 3, 8, 165560) The words which I pen or speak, come to me unsought.
('55', 77, 3, 9, 165613) Only such words have truth in them, for they are living words.
('55', 77, 3, 10, 165676) All other statements are insincere.
('55', 77, 3, 11, 165712) They may seem arresting, but I think they produce no abiding effect on the heart.
('55', 77, 3, 12, 165794) I can do nothing insincere.
('55', 77, 3, 13, 165822) During my student days in England, I attempted twice [to make prepared speeches] and failed on both occasions.
('55', 77, 3, 14, 165933) 1 I never tried again.
('55', 77, 3, 15, 165956) And what is true about my speaking is also true about my behaviour to you on all other occasions which you mention.
('55', 77, 3, 16, 166072) I remember the conversation we had regarding Mirabehn.
('55', 77, 3, 17, 166127) 2 I must have replied to you as I felt at the moment.
('55', 77, 3, 18, 166181) I can understand that my words did not produce a good impression on you.
('55', 77, 3, 19, 166254) That is a measure of the imperfection of my non violence.
('55', 77, 3, 20, 166312) I must have said only what I felt, but you might have felt a sting in my words.
('55', 77, 3, 21, 166392) One must speak the truth in words which are agreeable is not only a maxim of practical wisdom but is a moral principle.
('55', 77, 3, 22, 166512) Agreeable here means non violent.
('55', 77, 3, 23, 166546) If I had told you gently what I did excitedly, my words would not have left behind them the bitter memory which they have.
('55', 77, 3, 24, 166669) Truth stated in a spirit of non violence may hurt at the moment, but its ultimate effect must be as sweet as amrit.
('55', 77, 3, 25, 166785) This is an essential test of non violence.
('55', 77, 3, 26, 166828) I am writing this from my own bitter experience.
('55', 77, 3, 27, 166877) I may have spoken to you vehemently in defence of Mirabehn, but I have not made any man or woman weep as bitterly as I have made her.
('55', 77, 3, 28, 167011) My hardness of heart, impatience and ignorant attachment were responsible for such conduct.
('55', 77, 3, 29, 167103) I have felt Mirabehns self sacrifice to be beyond praise and, therefore, wish to see her perfect.
('55', 77, 3, 30, 167201) The moment I see any imperfection in her, my ignorant attachment makes me
('55', 77, 4, 31, 167275) 1Vide An Autobiography and An Autobiography 2 The addressee had been rebuked by Gandhiji when she complained against Mirabehns having blocked a passage; later she quoted this incident as proof of Gandhijis unwillingness to listen to complaints against those whom he trusted.

('55', 78, 1, 2, 167595) impatient and I rebuke her sharply.
('55', 78, 1, 3, 167631) The result is a flood of tears.
('55', 78, 1, 4, 167663) These instances have opened my eyes to the presence of violence in me and, recalling them, I have been trying to reform myself.
('55', 78, 1, 5, 167791) I, therefore, welcome your letters.
('55', 78, 1, 6, 167827) I do not know whether in return I shall be able to give you anything, but personally I benefit from them.
('55', 78, 1, 7, 167933) I realized this thingmy hard heartednessmore vividly in England.
('55', 78, 1, 8, 167998) Mira was the chief person in attendance on me.
('55', 78, 1, 9, 168045) There, too, I caused her to weep bitterly on the slightest provocation.
('55', 78, 1, 10, 168117) But I learnt a lesson from that experience.
('55', 78, 1, 11, 168161) God has never let any delusion of mine last for ever.
('55', 78, 1, 12, 168215) Even in the political sphere, whenever I have taken a false step God has immediately opened my eyes.
('55', 78, 1, 13, 168316) Your letters help that process of awakening.
('55', 78, 1, 14, 168361) You will now understand my previous letter 1 better.
('55', 78, 1, 15, 168414) How can we expect perfection from an imperfect being?
('55', 78, 1, 16, 168468) A blind man has collected a band of other blind folk.
('55', 78, 1, 17, 168522) But the blind man knows that he is blind, and also knows the cure for his blindness.
('55', 78, 1, 18, 168607) Hence, though living with blind people, he is confident that he will not lead them into a pit, nor will he himself fall into it.
('55', 78, 1, 19, 168736) He walks with a stick in is hand.
('55', 78, 1, 20, 168770) He feels the path ahead with the stick before taking every step.
('55', 78, 1, 21, 168835) And, therefore, things have gone well on the whole so far.
('55', 78, 1, 22, 168894) If, despite his using the stick, the blind man has occasionally strayed from the path, he has immediately realized his error and retraced his steps and led back his co workers.
('55', 78, 1, 23, 169071) So long as my blindness remains, even a person like you who loves me will continue to have reasons to criticize me.
('55', 78, 1, 24, 169187) When the blindness has disappeared, there will be no such grounds for criticism.
('55', 78, 1, 25, 169268) Meanwhile, let all of us, blind men and women, who are seekers after truth, describe the elephant as we perceive it.
('55', 78, 1, 26, 169385) Our descriptions will vary, but each will be perfectly true from the persons limited point of view.
('55', 78, 1, 27, 169485) After all, everyone of us will have but touched the elephant.
('55', 78, 1, 28, 169547) When our eyes open all of us will dance with joy and shout: How blind we were!
('55', 78, 1, 29, 169626) This is an elephant, about which we had read in the Gita.
('55', 78, 1, 30, 169684) How fortunate it would have been if our eyes had opened earlier.
('55', 78, 1, 31, 169749) But why should we worry if their opening is delayed?
('55', 78, 1, 32, 169802) Time has no meaning for God, or rather He measures it differently.
('55', 78, 1, 33, 169869) Ignorance, thus, will become transformed into knowledge.
('55', 78, 1, 34, 169926) I hope you will get from this an explanation of all the shortcomings you may have observed in me.
('55', 78, 1, 35, 170024) That does not mean, of course, that you should not put your doubts before me.

('55', 79, 10, 24, 171085) SHIVABHAI, I got your letter.
('55', 79, 10, 25, 171115) Every human being is liable to err.
('55', 79, 10, 26, 171151) However, nothing but good results to him who, on realizing his mistake, tries to mend it, since in the long run such a person learns not to make mistakes.
('55', 79, 10, 27, 171306) His conduct is inspired by love of truth.
('55', 79, 10, 28, 171348) Where there is such love, the erring man will not deceive himself or the world.
('55', 79, 10, 29, 171428) I would regard it as his error if Tolstoy expressed the opinion that you mention.
('55', 79, 10, 30, 171510) He expressed such mistaken opinions on several occasions.
('55', 79, 10, 31, 171568) His greatness lay in the fact that as soon as he realized his

('55', 80, 1, 2, 171709) mistake, he confessed it and corrected it.
('55', 80, 1, 3, 171752) Moreover, there were so many changes in his way of life that one should also take into account the time when he expressed a particular opinion.
('55', 80, 1, 4, 171896) In any case, in the matter of husband wife relationship, I myself am definitely of the opinion that the consent of both should be necessary for their union and not for living apart.
('55', 80, 1, 5, 172078) If that were not so, both would ordinarily remain in a fallen state.
('55', 80, 1, 6, 172147) It happens only in rare cases that both wake up at thesame time and remain awake together.

('55', 80, 7, 20, 172977) Is it not through the root?
('55', 80, 7, 21, 173005) We get our food through the stomach.
('55', 80, 7, 22, 173042) The food is turned into its essence there, and it is then digested and nourishes the body.

('55', 81, 11, 24, 174464) What would it avail even if it survives this time?
('55', 81, 11, 25, 174515) Every calamity, if we properly understand it, is a test.
('55', 81, 11, 26, 174572) And a test means suffering, that is, penance.
('55', 81, 11, 27, 174618) Now penance always purifies the person who undergoes it and also purifies the cause for which it is undertaken.

('55', 82, 6, 8, 175007) BHAGWANJI, I got your letter.
('55', 82, 6, 9, 175037) I did reply to you.
('55', 82, 6, 10, 175057) 1 It is certainly possible to acquire control over the sense organs.
('55', 82, 6, 11, 175126) The Shastras proclaim in the clearest words that such control is difficult, but they were composed to help people to acquire it.
('55', 82, 6, 12, 175255) It becomes possible through hard practice and the cultivation of disinterestedness.
('55', 82, 6, 13, 175339) Spiritual development and self realization go hand in hand.
('55', 82, 6, 14, 175399) The remedy for your mental agitation lies in you, and rest also depends on you.
('55', 82, 6, 15, 175479) I see many in jails who do no work, but all of them appear agitated.
('55', 82, 6, 16, 175548) Rest for the body is not true rest.
('55', 82, 6, 17, 175584) The sun that takes no rest even for a moment is always fresh.
('55', 82, 6, 18, 175646) The Lord says that, though He works ceaselessly without rest and without one moment of relaxation, He is the abode of peace.
('55', 82, 6, 19, 175771) You should, therefore, seek everything within yourself.At this time when the inmates of the Ashram are doing real work and not merely play acting, you find it uninteresting.
('55', 82, 6, 20, 175945) Though there are numerous weaknesses in the Ashram, I describe its work as real because it is not a shop doing business but a means of serving the world and a sincere attempt in that direction to the best of our ability.
('55', 82, 6, 21, 176166) For anybody who understands the things aright, the Ashram activities are in truth rest from work.

('55', 84, 8, 17, 178457) The place is certainly cold, but this is considered the best season.
('55', 84, 8, 18, 178526) Even persons who are ill go there in this season.

('55', 85, 2, 3, 178973) MY DEAR CHILD, I was delighted to have your letter again and the unexpected scribble from Nani 1. I see you have a cosmopolitan company 2. I only hope this does not give you more than your health can manage.
('55', 85, 2, 4, 179181) No, the Gita does not teach differently.
('55', 85, 2, 5, 179222) What it does teach is that all our acts must be natural and spontaneous even when unconscious.
('55', 85, 2, 6, 179317) When they are so, there is no thought of reward or result.
('55', 85, 2, 7, 179376) There is, therefore, in pure love no giving and no taking.
('55', 85, 2, 8, 179435) Put in another way there is no giving on earth without taking.
('55', 85, 2, 9, 179498) Love gives because it must; it is its nature.
('55', 85, 2, 10, 179544) It therefore does not calculate whether there is a corresponding gain.
('55', 85, 2, 11, 179615) It is unconscious of the giving and more so of the taking.
('55', 85, 2, 12, 179674) Love is its own reward.
('55', 85, 2, 13, 179698) When there is that ineffable love, there is a joy which is above all the so called joys we think we experience from outward circumstances.
('55', 85, 2, 14, 179837) It is that joy I want you to possess.
('55', 85, 2, 15, 179875) There was a time when you thought, I thought, you had it.
('55', 85, 2, 16, 179933) But you had not then gone through the fire.
('55', 85, 2, 17, 179977) The joy that will surely be yours one day will come out of the purifying richness of that fire.
('55', 85, 2, 18, 180073) It will steal over you when it does come.
('55', 85, 2, 19, 180115) May it come soon.

('55', 86, 6, 10, 180995) In spite of his struggles a man is carried away by passion, since to destroy it completely requires an immense effort.
('55', 86, 6, 11, 181114) Some things require comparatively less effort and some others require a much greater effort.
('55', 86, 6, 12, 181207) We require less effort to spin yarn of 10 or 20 counts, but none has progressed so far as to spin yarn of 200 counts.
('55', 86, 6, 13, 181325) To do that requires better equipment and a far greater effort.
('55', 86, 6, 14, 181388) We do know that they spun yarn of 200 counts in Bengal a hundred years ago.
('55', 86, 6, 15, 181464) If different degrees of effort are required in such a small matter as spinning, it is bound to be so in acquiring freedom from passion.
('55', 86, 6, 16, 181600) Knowing this, the more we meet with failure the greater should our efforts be.
('55', 86, 6, 17, 181679) Some mountaineers have been attempting to reach the top of the Himalayas.
('55', 86, 6, 18, 181753) But none has succeeded so far.

('55', 87, 0, 1, 182345) 88 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 87, 1, 2, 182386) particularly in the kitchen is due entirely to our shortcomings.
('55', 87, 1, 3, 182451) I list below for your information as many rules as I can think of.
('55', 87, 1, 4, 182518) If you follow them, you will not find the least difficulty in running the kitchen.
('55', 87, 1, 5, 182601) 1. Never lose your temper whatever happens, whether something is spoilt or broken.
('55', 87, 1, 6, 182684) Never be impatient.
('55', 87, 1, 7, 182704) Never worry about anything.
('55', 87, 1, 8, 182732) Find out the cause of the trouble and remove it.
('55', 87, 1, 9, 182781) 2. If a co worker does not finish his work or is lazy about it do not get irritated with him, but take upon yourself the additional burden.
('55', 87, 1, 10, 182921) 3. Do thoroughly and as perfectly as you can whatever you do.
('55', 87, 1, 11, 182983) 4. Never play with one another while in the kitchen.
('55', 87, 1, 12, 183036) Do not hit anybody even in jest.
('55', 87, 1, 13, 183069) 5. The best thing is not to speak a word unless necessary.
('55', 87, 1, 14, 183128) If anybody cannot control himself, he may talk in low whispers and make harmless and innocent jokes.
('55', 87, 1, 15, 183229) However, everybody should gradually form the habit of speaking nothing at all.
('55', 87, 1, 16, 183308) 6. If you do talk, do not indulge in malicious criticism of one another or back biting.
('55', 87, 1, 17, 183396) 7. It is enough for small boys to wear only tucked up dhotis in the kitchen.
('55', 87, 1, 18, 183473) The girls also, when sitting, should tuck up their skirts behind and wear only jackets above them.
('55', 87, 1, 19, 183572) It is not necessary for them to wear the half sari in the kitchen.
('55', 87, 1, 20, 183639) This saves cloth and minimizes the danger of clothes catching fire.
('55', 87, 1, 21, 183707) If anybody wears a shirt, the sleeves should be tucked up at the elbow.
('55', 87, 1, 22, 183779) 8. When anybody feels the urge to sneeze, he should hold the kerchief over his mouth before sneezing, so that he does not blow spittle from the mouth.
('55', 87, 1, 23, 183930) Use tie kerchief for blowing the nose and, if you perspire, wipe the drops with it.
('55', 87, 1, 24, 184014) One ought not to let the drops fall into anything.
('55', 87, 1, 25, 184065) This means that everyone must carry a handkerchief.
('55', 87, 1, 26, 184117) 9. For wiping the utensils, etc., there should be a separate towel in the kitchen and it should be washed everyday with soap.
('55', 87, 1, 27, 184243) 10. Everyone working in the kitchen should take special care to keep his nails clean.
('55', 87, 1, 28, 184329) They should be trimmed regularly.
('55', 87, 1, 29, 184363) If there is still any dirt under them, it should be removed with pointed straw.
('55', 87, 1, 30, 184443) 11. No one should touch or taste any cooked item for sampling it.
('55', 87, 1, 31, 184509) 12. If, to ascertain whether a vegetable or some similar dish has
('55', 88, 0, 1, 184575) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 89
('55', 88, 1, 2, 184620) been properly salted, it has to be tasted, the leader of the boys may take some in a spoon and taste it and, after doing so, immediately wash the spoon clean.
('55', 88, 1, 3, 184779) 13. If some special dish or dishes have to be cooked for a sick person or a person who is observing a vow, do not regard this as a burden but cook the thing cheerfully.
('55', 88, 1, 4, 184948) Experience will show that, if the time table for the various jobs has been strictly followed, no burden will be felt at all.
('55', 88, 1, 5, 185073) 14. Make it a point to arrive at the kitchen punctually at the time appointed for you.
('55', 88, 1, 6, 185160) Know that every minute matters, so that you should arrive two minutes earlier but never a minute later.
('55', 88, 1, 7, 185264) 15. If you have no work in the kitchen, do not remain there to gossip or just to look at the others working.
('55', 88, 1, 8, 185373) 16. The kitchen should be kept clean all the time.
('55', 88, 1, 9, 185424) All the things should be in their proper places.
('55', 88, 1, 10, 185473) After ones job is done, one should not leave without arranging the things in order.
('55', 88, 1, 11, 185557) In addition to these, you may introduce other rules that you may think of.
('55', 88, 1, 12, 185632) If you think that any of those given by me should be dropped, you may drop them with the consent of the elders.
('55', 88, 1, 13, 185744) But scrupulously follow whatever rules you lay down.
('55', 88, 1, 14, 185797) Everyone should make a copy of the rules and keep it with him.
('55', 88, 1, 15, 185860) I have often felt that the kitchen provides a means for us to test how far we practise the teaching of the Gita.
('55', 88, 2, 16, 185973) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] I am not writing a separate letter to the women today, since this one is already longer than I had intended it to be, and, moreover, such a letter should do quite well for them also.

('55', 90, 2, 3, 187731) February 29, 1932
('55', 90, 3, 4, 187749) There was once a wise man, named Socrates, who lived in Athens.
('55', 90, 3, 5, 187813) His unconventional ideas, which, however, spread love of truth and goodness, displeased the authorities, and he was sentenced to death.
('55', 90, 3, 6, 187949) In that country people were in those days sometimes sentenced to die by drinking poison.
('55', 90, 3, 7, 188038) Like Mirabai, Socrates was asked to drink a cup of poison.
('55', 90, 3, 8, 188097) Our purpose here is to discuss the substance of the concluding words of Socratess defence at the time of his trial.
('55', 90, 3, 9, 188213) We can all derive a moral from it.
('55', 90, 3, 10, 188248) Let us call Socrates by the name Sukrit.
('55', 90, 3, 11, 188289) The Arabs knew him as Sokrat.
('55', 90, 3, 12, 188319) This is what Sukrit said: It is my unshakable faith that no harm comes to a good man either in this world or the next.
('55', 90, 3, 13, 188438) God never forsakes good men and their friends.
('55', 90, 3, 14, 188485) I also believe that nobody ever dies before his time.
('55', 90, 3, 15, 188539) I dont look upon the sentence of death as a punishment.
('55', 90, 3, 16, 188595) The time has come for me to die and be delivered from the sufferings of this life.
('55', 90, 3, 17, 188678) That is why you have condemned me to die by drinking poison.
('55', 90, 3, 18, 188739) I am sure that my good lies in that.
('55', 90, 3, 19, 188776) I, therefore, bear no anger against my prosecutors or against those who have condemned me.
('55', 90, 3, 20, 188867) They may not have meant well by me, but they can do me no harm either.
('55', 90, 3, 21, 188938) I have one request to make to the council of elders.
('55', 90, 3, 22, 188991) If my sons forsake the path of goodness and follow that of evil, if they become lovers of wealth, punish them as you have punished me.
('55', 90, 3, 23, 189126) Punish them also if they become hypocrites and try to show themselves other than what they are.
('55', 90, 3, 24, 189222) If you do so, my sons and I will believe that you have acted justly. This is a request of Sukrit in regard to his sons.
('55', 90, 3, 25, 189342) The elders of the city who had assembled to pass judgment on him, did not know the law of non violence.
('55', 90, 3, 26, 189446) He, therefore, made the foregoing request and thereby warned his sons and told them what he expected of them, and also rebuked the elders gently for punishing him for doing good.
('55', 90, 3, 27, 189625) By suggesting to his sons that they should follow in his footsteps, he told them in effect that the path which he had shown to the citizens of

('55', 91, 6, 10, 190419) Evening, February 24, 1932
('55', 91, 7, 11, 190446) NARANDAS, I got your packet.
('55', 91, 7, 12, 190475) The issue of visitors has taken a serious turn and no solution seems to be in sight.
('55', 91, 7, 13, 190560) As you had hinted in your last letter, you also do not seem to have made any request for permission to see me.
('55', 91, 7, 14, 190671) This weeks post contains a letter by Lakshmi senior in which she complains against her letters being read [by you].
('55', 91, 7, 15, 190787) I think that once at prayer meeting you should ask all of them whether anybody has an objection against your reading his or her letters.
('55', 91, 7, 16, 190924) If any of them object, you need not read their letters, and even if you think that it is necessary to read them read only those of their letters which they permit you to read.
('55', 91, 7, 17, 191100) Dont mind if your letters become long.
('55', 91, 7, 18, 191139) I should like you to give me all the information which it is permissible for you to give.
('55', 91, 7, 19, 191229) Discuss with Shankerlal 1 the problem of increasing the quantity of yarn spun.
('55', 91, 7, 20, 191308) The Parnerkar affair is a painful one.
('55', 91, 7, 21, 191347) Show as much love and sympathy as you can.
('55', 91, 7, 22, 191390) I understand what you say about the Giri family.

('55', 92, 1, 3, 191685) If the agreement about visitors does not break down, even as many as five to seven persons can come and see me.
('55', 92, 1, 4, 191797) But, as far as possible, we should take care that they are not more than five.

('55', 92, 1, 7, 191994) Have you informed Dr. Jivraj [Mehta] that Triveni 2 does not keep good health?
('55', 92, 1, 8, 192073) Is it through obstinacy that Kusum does not try the remedy which I have suggested?
('55', 92, 1, 9, 192156) Revashankarbhais Dhiru had a bone whichhad decayed and he was cured by sun baths.

('55', 92, 1, 11, 192289) I had a fairly long talk with Mathew.
('55', 92, 1, 12, 192327) You will be happy to know that he spins and does a bit of other work.
('55', 92, 1, 13, 192397) Afternoon, February 29, 1932 I have not yet been able to start Bal Gita 3. Nor can I decide what else I can write and send.
('55', 92, 1, 14, 192521) This week, therefore, I send no special material.

('55', 93, 12, 24, 194421) DEAR MAJOR MARTIN, As you know, for two weeks now I have not had any visits.
('55', 93, 12, 25, 194498) They have been stopped because, I understand, the Government are revising the instructions that have been in force in this connection.
('55', 93, 12, 26, 194633) The suspense is tantalizing for me and inconvenient for those who wish to

('55', 94, 1, 2, 194752) visit me.
('55', 94, 1, 3, 194762) I would therefore like an early decision in the matter.
('55', 94, 1, 4, 194818) The question of seeing my companions who have been brought to this prison and on which I wrote 1 to you a fortnight ago is much more vital for me.
('55', 94, 1, 5, 194965) As I have said, this meeting of some of my companions now and then is a human want I may not deny myself without shaking and impairing the whole nervous system.
('55', 94, 1, 6, 195126) I had hoped that you would procure an early decision, as I have simply asked for a repetition of what was considered reasonable by the Government last year.
('55', 94, 1, 7, 195283) 2 I press for an early reply.

('55', 94, 6, 12, 195444) DEAR SISTER, I have been robbing you of lots of honey these days.
('55', 94, 6, 13, 195510) Both of us have to take it frequently with warm water, and so two bottles get exhausted in nine or ten days.
('55', 94, 6, 14, 195619) If you experience difficulty in getting honey, please let me know.
('55', 94, 6, 15, 195686) Sometimes the honey is mixed with dirt and sometimes there are pieces of cork in it.
('55', 94, 6, 16, 195771) That made me doubt whether the honey was collected from hives in the countryside.
('55', 94, 6, 17, 195853) If that is so, I would not regard it fit for our consumption, for in collecting such honey a great many bees are killed and, moreover, it is never clean.
('55', 94, 6, 18, 196007) I, therefore, eat only the honey which is collected scientifically.
('55', 94, 6, 19, 196075) Such honey is now collected in our country.
('55', 94, 6, 20, 196119) Please inquire how the honey which you send is collected and let me know.

('55', 95, 5, 10, 196815) What is the state of your mind?
('55', 95, 5, 11, 196847) I met Father several times and came into close contact with him.
('55', 95, 5, 12, 196912) He looked after me with great love.
('55', 95, 5, 13, 196948) He used to come and see me practically every day.
('55', 95, 5, 14, 196998) And he had literally encamped with Mahadev, Devdas and the others.
('55', 95, 5, 15, 197065) I tried hard to persuade him to return to India, but did not succeed.
('55', 95, 5, 16, 197135) Certainly he has in him a high degree of the spirit of self sacrifice.

('55', 95, 11, 22, 197331) I got your letter.
('55', 95, 11, 23, 197350) It is my habit to give to children names which suggest the qualities we wish them to have.
('55', 95, 11, 24, 197441) Following that practice, I suggest Gopal (lal or das) or Madhav (lal or das).
('55', 95, 11, 25, 197519) Both are names of the Lord whose pet (lal) or servant (das) I would like myself or anybody else to be.
('55', 95, 11, 26, 197622) Further, the word Gopal has two beautiful meanings: Go means a cow or a sense organ, so that the name would also signify one who keeps cows or one who controls the senses.
('55', 95, 11, 27, 197794) Madhav, too, means nearly the same thing.
('55', 95, 11, 28, 197836) Madhav is the destroyer of the demon Madhu, who dwells in our bodies.
('55', 95, 11, 29, 197906) If you have any difficulty in choosing between these two names you may cast lots and decide.
('55', 95, 11, 30, 197999) If the choice were left to me, I would prefer Gopal.
('55', 95, 12, 31, 198052) 1 The reference is to the following sentences in the letter dated February 2, 1932: I ate for many days the honey which you had given me for the voyage.

('55', 98, 8, 16, 201272) Now that you have entered upon your sixteenth year, you have become a responsible person.
('55', 98, 8, 17, 201362) Improve your health and dedicate yourself to the service of others for life.
('55', 98, 8, 18, 201439) And for this you should, of your own free will, observe the rules of Ashram life.
('55', 98, 8, 19, 201521) Now to your questions.
('55', 98, 8, 20, 201544) In the Ashram we keep no idol or image because there is before us Gods image in the form of the world and we should know God through it.
('55', 98, 8, 21, 201681) If we look at the sky, there are innumerable images there too, and if we wish we may meditate on any of them and think that God dwells there also.
('55', 98, 8, 22, 201828) In this connection, we should remember that persons like Imam Saheb and Amina did not find it necessary to have what people call an idol.
('55', 98, 8, 23, 201966) I have rivers and valleys to be crossed, which means that I have a

('55', 99, 1, 3, 202197) There can be no absolution from the sin of telling a lie knowingly, no matter how severe the prayashchitta one undergoes for it.
('55', 99, 1, 4, 202326) Prayashchitta wins forgiveness only for one who has told a lie in ignorance.
('55', 99, 1, 5, 202403) Do you understand this?
('55', 99, 1, 6, 202427) If not, ask me again.

('55', 100, 7, 17, 204042) I have known few persons as fortunate as he.
('55', 100, 7, 18, 204087) We would be happy to see him live long and be our guide and counsellor.
('55', 100, 7, 19, 204159) But, should he die now, even from the ordinary human point of view that should be no cause for grief.
('55', 100, 7, 20, 204261) Since, however, there is no further news from you, I assume that the cloud has vanished.
('55', 100, 7, 21, 204350) The issue of visitors has been partly settled.
('55', 100, 7, 22, 204397) Anyone from the Ashram can come and see me, though even from among the Ashram inmates those who are classed as political cannot come.
('55', 100, 7, 23, 204531) But there are none such at present, unless we count Valji among them.
('55', 100, 7, 24, 204601) If, therefore, anybody wishes to come next week, he may.
('55', 100, 7, 25, 204658) The Superintendent should be informed in advance.

('55', 103, 2, 3, 207194) March 6, 1932
('55', 103, 3, 4, 207208) During my incarceration in 1930 in the Yeravda Central Prison, I wrote weekly letters to the Satyagraha Ashrams containing a cursory examination of the principal Ashram observances.
('55', 103, 3, 5, 207390) 1 As the Ashram influence had already travelled beyond its geographical limits, copies of the letters were multiplied for distribution.
('55', 103, 3, 6, 207526) They were written in Gujarati.
('55', 103, 3, 7, 207557) There was a demand for translation into Hindi and other Indian languages, and also into English.
('55', 103, 3, 8, 207654) Shri Valji Desai gave a fairly full translation in English.
('55', 103, 3, 9, 207714) But seeing me in possession of comparative leisure during the recurrent incarceration, he has sent me his translation for revision.
('55', 103, 3, 10, 207846) I have gone through it carefully, and touched up several passages to bring out my meaning more to my liking.
('55', 103, 3, 11, 207955) I need hardly add that, if I was writing anew for the English reader, perhaps I should write a wholly new thing.
('55', 103, 3, 12, 208068) But that would be going beyond my commission.
('55', 103, 3, 13, 208114) And perhaps it is as well that even the English reader has the trend of my thought as expressed to the inmates of the Ashram, and in the year 1930. I have therefore taken the least liberty with the original argument.

('55', 103, 6, 16, 208364) 100. LETTER TO M. G. BHANDARI
('55', 103, 7, 17, 208394) March 6, 1932
('55', 103, 8, 18, 208408) DEAR MAJOR BHANDARI, You have kindly given me a copy of the fresh instructions issued by the Government about the weekly visits.
('55', 103, 8, 19, 208537) I appreciate the trust reposed in me regarding the determination as to who shall be considered political inmates of the Ashram.
('55', 103, 8, 20, 208665) I am anxious to be true to the trust.
('55', 103, 8, 21, 208703) But before I could do so, there should be a common definition of the adjective political between the Government and me.
('55', 103, 8, 22, 208823) I take political to mean those who are politically minded and are actually taking part in politics as apart
('55', 103, 9, 23, 208931) 1Vide footnote 1, Letter to Narandas Gandhi, 27 1 1932
('55', 104, 0, 1, 208986) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 105
('55', 104, 1, 2, 209032) from civil resistance.
('55', 104, 1, 3, 209055) For if by political are meant those who have been heretofore imprisoned as civil resisters or are believers in the doctrine of civil resistance, then there is no non political inmate in the Ashram.
('55', 104, 1, 4, 209253) If, however, the meaning is [as] I have given it, there are only three political inmates.
('55', 104, 1, 5, 209343) I mean Sjts.
('55', 104, 1, 6, 209356) Mahadev Desai, Pyarelal and Devdas Gandhi.
('55', 104, 1, 7, 209399) But if I may not see the first two, I may not see Devdas Gandhi for they are like Devdas to me.
('55', 104, 1, 8, 209495) As it so happens, they are all incarcerated.
('55', 104, 1, 9, 209540) I may also mention that at the present moment there are only boys and girls and the few adults who are reserved for looking after the youngsters and the multifarious industrial activities of the Ashram.
('55', 104, 1, 10, 209743) It is difficult, too, for me to submit a list of non Ashram friends till I know the definition that the Government have in mind of the term political.
('55', 104, 1, 11, 209894) I shall await reply to this before I submit a fairly full list for approval.
('55', 104, 1, 12, 209971) But, meanwhile, I give below illustrative names of those friends whom I regard as non political and whom I would put in the same category as my relatives.
('55', 104, 1, 13, 210126) Lady Thackersey, residenceYeravda Hill.
('55', 104, 1, 14, 210166) She is a social worker.
('55', 104, 1, 15, 210190) She helped me during my serious illness in 1923 when I was a patient in the Sasoon Hospital.
('55', 104, 1, 16, 210283) Trivedi of the Agriculture College, Poona.
('55', 104, 1, 17, 210326) He stands to me in the same close contact as Lady Thackersey.
('55', 104, 1, 18, 210388) Yeshvantprasad Desai, mill owner residing in Matunga.
('55', 104, 1, 19, 210442) He nursed me during the same illness and took up his abode in Poona for helping me.
('55', 104, 1, 20, 210526) Pyare Ali and his wife, living in retirement at a retreat near Thana, where they have taken in a few Muslim orphans.
('55', 104, 1, 21, 210643) They lived nearly a year at the Ashram.
('55', 104, 1, 22, 210683) They are a deeply religious couple.
('55', 104, 1, 23, 210719) These friends are in no sense political.
('55', 104, 1, 24, 210760) Pending reply to this letter, I have written to the Manager of the Ashram 1 to send those inmates who may wish to visit me.
('55', 104, 2, 25, 210884) Yours sincerely, M. K. GANDHI

('55', 105, 2, 3, 211140) March 7, 1932
('55', 105, 3, 4, 211154) I am not yet ready to write and send chapters of the Bal Gita.
('55', 105, 3, 5, 211217) As I was wondering what I should send this time, it occurred to me that I should give to the inmates of the Ashram my reminiscences of the Imam Saheb and should carry out this good resolution without delay.
('55', 105, 3, 6, 211424) I, therefore, wish to write out such reminiscences as occur to me and as I think I may narrate.
('55', 105, 3, 7, 211520) Imam Saheb went to South Africa about the same year as I (1893).
('55', 105, 3, 8, 211585) His real name was Abdul Kadir Bawazeer, but, as he served as Imam in South Africa, most people knew him as Imam Saheb.
('55', 105, 3, 9, 211704) I always addressed him by this name.
('55', 105, 3, 10, 211741) The Imam Sahebs father was the Muezzin of the famous Jumma Masjid in Bombay and served in that capacity right till his death.
('55', 105, 3, 11, 211867) He died only a few years ago, after the Imam Sahebs return to India.
('55', 105, 3, 12, 211936) He fell dead just as he was washing and getting ready for the azan 2. Such a death comes only to the blessed.
('55', 105, 3, 13, 212046) The Imam Sahebs forefathers were Arabs and had come to India and settled in the Konkan years ago.
('55', 105, 3, 14, 212144) Hence he knew the Konkani language too.
('55', 105, 3, 15, 212184) His mother tongue was Gujarati, but he had little schooling.
('55', 105, 3, 16, 212245) He knew Arabic well enough to be able to read from the Koran Sharif with a pleasing intonation, though not so well as to be able to understand everything in the Koran.
('55', 105, 3, 17, 212413) He had picked up, through contacts inpractical life, English, Dutch and Creole French.
('55', 105, 3, 18, 212500) Urdu, of course, he knew.
('55', 105, 3, 19, 212526) He had also a working knowledge of Zulu.
('55', 105, 3, 20, 212567) His intellect was so sharp that, if he had regularly studied in a school, he would have earned reputation as a great scholar.
('55', 105, 3, 21, 212693) Though he was not a lawyer, he had come to understand subtleties of law through practical experience.
('55', 105, 3, 22, 212795) The Imam Saheb had gone to South Africa for trade and had earned much.
('55', 105, 3, 23, 212866) When he gave up business, he kept coaches which he supplied on hire and had a fairly good income from that calling.
('55', 105, 3, 24, 212982) Being a man of independent temper, he never tried his fortune in big
('55', 105, 4, 25, 213051) 1 This was sent along with Letter to Narandas Gandhi; vide the following item.

('55', 106, 1, 2, 213199) business.
('55', 106, 1, 3, 213209) He had a sweet voice, and, since his father was a Muezzin, he occasionally officiated as Imam in the mosque in Johannesburg.
('55', 106, 1, 4, 213334) But he accepted no honorarium for his services.
('55', 106, 1, 5, 213382) The Imam Saheb had married twice.
('55', 106, 1, 6, 213416) Both the wives were Malays.
('55', 106, 1, 7, 213444) His first marriage was not successful, and so he married the lady whom we knew as his wife.
('55', 106, 1, 8, 213536) This marriage had given him much happiness.
('55', 106, 1, 9, 213580) He and the Haji Saheba served each other with great devotion.
('55', 106, 1, 10, 213642) He was a sincere friend.
('55', 106, 1, 11, 213667) So far as I know, the Imam Sahebs views about marriage had undergone a complete change and he had come to believe in monogamy.

('55', 106, 4, 14, 213869) March 7, 1932
('55', 106, 5, 15, 213883) NARANDAS, I infer from your second postcard that you must have returned to the Ashram.
('55', 106, 5, 16, 213970) I hope you got my postcard 1 despatched from here yesterday.
('55', 106, 5, 17, 214031) Through some visitor, send again a piece of leather for the soles.
('55', 106, 5, 18, 214098) I observe that there is one sole every month to be repaired.
('55', 106, 5, 19, 214159) There is no urgency about the leather.
('55', 106, 5, 20, 214198) Both the sandals have been re soled only recently, so that they will require no attention for two months at least.
('55', 106, 5, 21, 214313) It was only in order that it may be handy in case of necessity that I have asked you so early to send one.
('55', 106, 5, 22, 214420) All inmates of the Ashram who may be described as non political will be permitted now to visit me.
('55', 106, 5, 23, 214519) It is left to me to decide which of the inmates should be treated as political.
('55', 106, 5, 24, 214599) But whom theGovernment would class as political, I can know only when I receive its definition of the term.
('55', 106, 5, 25, 214707) I have, therefore, asked for such a definition.
('55', 106, 5, 26, 214755) 2 Meanwhile, anyone who wishes to come from there and whom you permit may come and see me, since, according to me, there is no one in the Ashram at present who may be described as political.
('55', 106, 5, 27, 214946) If nobody is particularly eager to come, it is not necessary for any of you to come merely to make us feel happy.
('55', 106, 5, 28, 215060) If, however, anybody wishes to come, I would not say No to him or her.
('55', 106, 5, 29, 215131) The Government has asked for a list of non politicals not living in the

('55', 107, 6, 21, 216217) We both are all right here.

('55', 108, 5, 14, 217608) March 7, 1932
('55', 108, 7, 15, 217622) I think Rama humbled your pride by making you forget to complete your sacrificial spinning.
('55', 108, 7, 16, 217714) 1 I dont count your lapse to be as serious as you do.
('55', 108, 7, 17, 217768) It is right, however, that you should regard it as big enough.
('55', 108, 7, 18, 217831) I say that Rama humbled your pride because if we, who are but puppets constantly liable to err, did not commit a single mistake in doing something, we are likely to be filled with pride (however subtle it may be).
('55', 108, 7, 19, 218045) Rama seems to have treated you in the same way as He or was it Siva?had treated Narad.
('55', 108, 7, 20, 218132) The incident has had two good resultsyour pride has been humbled and you will not make the same mistake again.
('55', 108, 7, 21, 218243) I have no comment to make here on the vivid sketches in your letter.
('55', 108, 7, 22, 218312) I have never believed that you are hard hearted.
('55', 108, 7, 23, 218361) Your criticisms help me.
('55', 108, 7, 24, 218386) Every one of us has virtues and weaknesses.
('55', 108, 7, 25, 218430) If you are less inclined to see the virtues of others, try to see them more often.
('55', 108, 7, 26, 218513) There was nothing in my letter to make Narandas ask questions about himself.
('55', 108, 7, 27, 218590) He does work in the spirit of yajna.
('55', 108, 7, 28, 218627) It is not his fault that I have left him no time to do any body labour.
('55', 108, 7, 29, 218699) This, too, is evidence of my lack of organizing ability.

('55', 109, 0, 1, 219032) 110 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

('55', 109, 1, 3, 219179) We have gone on the way we started.
('55', 109, 1, 4, 219215) I believe that it is still possible to change things, but I do not know how, and the Ashram has still not got a man or a woman, who will give more thought to the problem and enforce the Ashram rules more strictly.
('55', 109, 1, 5, 219429) Till we get such a person, we should tolerate the present conditions.
('55', 109, 1, 6, 219499) Let us always remember that the Ashram very much falls short of its ideal, for I believe it quite possible to organize things so well that everyone in it will do his or her share of body labour and good order will bepreserved.
('55', 109, 1, 7, 219726) Let us work in this faith.

('55', 111, 5, 9, 223108) March 11, 1932 2
('55', 111, 6, 10, 223125) DEAR SIR SAMUEL, You will perhaps recollect that at the end of my speech 3 at the Round Table Conference when the minorities claim was presented, I had said that I should resist with my life the grant of separate electorate to the Depressed Classes.
('55', 111, 6, 11, 223375) This was not said in the heat of the moment, nor by way of rhetoric.
('55', 111, 6, 12, 223444) It was meant to be a serious statement.
('55', 111, 6, 13, 223484) In pursuance of that statement, I had hoped on my return to India to mobilize public opinion against separate electorate, at any rate, for the Depressed Classes.
('55', 111, 6, 14, 223646) But it was not to be.
('55', 111, 6, 15, 223668) From the newspapers which I am permitted to read, I observe that any moment His Majestys Government may declare their decision.
('55', 111, 6, 16, 223796) At first I had thought that if the decision was found to create separate electorates for the Depressed Classes, I should take such steps as I might then consider necessary to give effect to my vow.
('55', 111, 6, 17, 223994) But I feel that it would be unfair to the British Government for me to act without giving previous notice.
('55', 111, 6, 18, 224101) Naturally they could not attach the significance I give to my statement.
('55', 111, 6, 19, 224174) I need hardly reiterate all the objections I have to the creation of
('55', 111, 7, 20, 224243) 1 Gandhijis letters from correspondents abroad were misdirected to the addressee.

('55', 112, 1, 2, 224533) separate electorates for the Depressed Classes.
('55', 112, 1, 3, 224581) I feel as if I was oneof them.
('55', 112, 1, 4, 224612) Their case stands on a wholly different footing from that of the others.
('55', 112, 1, 5, 224685) I am not against their representation in the legislatures.
('55', 112, 1, 6, 224744) I should favour every one of their adults, male or female, being registered as voters, irrespective of education or property qualifications, even though the franchise test may be stricter for the others.
('55', 112, 1, 7, 224948) But I hold that separate electorate is harmful for them and for Hinduism, whatever it may be from a purely political standpoint.
('55', 112, 1, 8, 225077) To appreciate the harm that separate electorates would do to them, one has to know how they are distributed amongst the so called caste Hindus, and how dependent they are on the latter.
('55', 112, 1, 9, 225263) So far as Hinduism is concerned separate electorate would simply vivisect and disrupt it.
('55', 112, 1, 10, 225353) For me the question of these classes is predominantly moral and religious.
('55', 112, 1, 11, 225428) The political aspect, important though it is, dwindles into insignificance compared to the moral and religious issue.
('55', 112, 1, 12, 225546) You will have to appreciate my feelings in this matter by remembering that I have been interested in the condition of these classes from my boyhood and have more than once staked my all for their sake.
('55', 112, 1, 13, 225748) I say this not to pride myself in any way.
('55', 112, 1, 14, 225791) For, I feel that no penance that caste Hindus may do can, in any way, compensate for the calculated degradation to which they have consigned the Depressed Classes for centuries.
('55', 112, 1, 15, 225969) But I know that separate electorate is neither penance nor any remedy for the crushing degradation they have groaned under.
('55', 112, 1, 16, 226093) I therefore respectfully inform His Majestys Government that in the event of their decision creating separate electorate for the Depressed Classes, I must fast unto death.
('55', 112, 1, 17, 226265) I am painfully conscious of the fact that such a step whilst I am a prisoner must cause grave embarrassment to His Majestys Government and that it will be regarded by many as highly improper on the part of one holding my position to introduce into the political field methods which they would describe as hysterical, if not much worse.
('55', 112, 1, 18, 226601) All I can urge in defence is that for me the contemplated step is not a method, it is part of my being.
('55', 112, 1, 19, 226705) It is a call of conscience which I dare not disobey, even though it may cost whatever reputation for sanity I may possess.
('55', 112, 1, 20, 226828) So far as I can see now, my discharge from imprisonment would not make the duty of fasting any the less imperative.
('55', 112, 1, 21, 226944) I am hoping, however, that all my fears are wholly unjustified and that the British Government have no intention whatever of
('55', 113, 0, 1, 227069) 114 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 113, 1, 2, 227111) creating separate electorate for the Depressed classes.
('55', 113, 1, 3, 227167) It is perhaps as well for me to refer to another matter that is agitating me and may also enforce a similar fast.
('55', 113, 1, 4, 227281) It is the wayrepression is going.
('55', 113, 1, 5, 227315) I have no notion when I may receive a shock that would compel the sacrifice.
('55', 113, 1, 6, 227392) Repression appears to me to be crossing what might be called the legitimate limit.
('55', 113, 1, 7, 227475) A Governmental terrorism is spreading through the land.
('55', 113, 1, 8, 227531) Both English and Indian officials are being brutalized.
('55', 113, 1, 9, 227587) The latter, high and low, are becoming demoralized by reason of the Government rewarding as meritorious, disloyalty to the people and inhuman conduct towards their own kith and kin.
('55', 113, 1, 10, 227769) The latter are being cowed down.
('55', 113, 1, 11, 227802) Free speech has been stifled.
('55', 113, 1, 12, 227832) Goondaism is being practised in the name of law and order.
('55', 113, 1, 13, 227891) Women who have come out for public service stand in fear of their honour being insulted.
('55', 113, 1, 14, 227980) And all this, as it seems to me, is being done in order to crush the spirit of freedom which the Congress represents.
('55', 113, 1, 15, 228098) Repression is not confined to punishing civil breaches of the common law.
('55', 113, 1, 16, 228172) It goads people to break newly made orders of autocracy designed for the most part to humiliate them.
('55', 113, 1, 17, 228274) In all these doings as I read them, I see no spirit of democracy.
('55', 113, 1, 18, 228340) Indeed, my recent visit to England has confirmed my opinion that your democracy is a superficial circumscribed thing.
('55', 113, 1, 19, 228458) In the weightiest matters decisions are taken by individuals or groups, without any reference to the Parliament, and these have been ratified by the Members having but a vague notion of what they were doing.
('55', 113, 1, 20, 228666) Such was the case with Egypt, the War of 1914, and such is the case with India.
('55', 113, 1, 21, 228746) My whole being rebels against the idea that in a system called democratic, one man should have the unfettered power of affecting the destiny of the ancient people numbering over three hundred millions, and that his decisions can be enforced by mobilizing the most terrible forces of destruction.
('55', 113, 1, 22, 229042) To me this is a negation of democracy.
('55', 113, 1, 23, 229081) And this repression cannot be prolonged without further embittering the already bitter relations between the two peoples.
('55', 113, 1, 24, 229203) In so far as I am responsible and can help it, how am I to arrest the process?
('55', 113, 1, 25, 229282) Not by stopping civil disobedience.
('55', 113, 1, 26, 229318) For me it is an article of faith.
('55', 113, 1, 27, 229352) I regard myself by nature a democrat.
('55', 113, 1, 28, 229390) Democracy of my conception is wholly inconsistent with the use of physical force for enforcing its will.
('55', 113, 1, 29, 229495) Civil resistance therefore has been conceived to be a proper substitute for physical force to be used wherever generally the latter is

('55', 114, 1, 3, 229707) It is a process of self suffering and a part of the plan is that in given circumstances a civil resister must sacrifice himself even by fasting to a finish.
('55', 114, 1, 4, 229864) That moment has not yet arrived for me.
('55', 114, 1, 5, 229904) I have no undeniable call from within for such a step.
('55', 114, 1, 6, 229959) But the events happening outside are alarming enough to agitate my fundamental being.
('55', 114, 1, 7, 230045) Therefore, in writing to you about the possibility of a fast regarding Depressed Classes, I felt that I would be untrue to you if I did not tell you also that there was another possibility, not remote, of such a fast.
('55', 114, 1, 8, 230263) Needless to say that from my side absolute secrecy has been maintained about all the correspondence I have carried on with you.
('55', 114, 1, 9, 230391) Of course Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Mahadev Desai, who has just been sent to join us, know all about it.

('55', 117, 8, 15, 234271) It is our duty to spin and hence, if we do not spin, we neglect our duty.
('55', 117, 8, 16, 234345) That means that we fall into a debt.
('55', 117, 8, 17, 234382) Just as the hand becomes dirty if we touch a dirty thing so if we tell a lie the mind is defiled, and that is worse than the hand becoming dirty.

('55', 118, 3, 5, 234919) Sannyasa does not mean the renunciation of all activities; it means only the renunciation of activities prompted by desire and of the fruits of action performed as duty.
('55', 118, 3, 6, 235089) This is real freedom from activity.
('55', 118, 3, 7, 235125) That is why one must learn to see inactivity in activity and activity in inactivity.
('55', 118, 3, 8, 235210) Freedom from activity means only one thing, and it is what I have explained above.
('55', 118, 3, 9, 235293) And still one must win such freedom.

('55', 118, 8, 20, 236046) I have been known, even during the past twelve years, to sacrifice friendships for the sake of what I have considered to be truth.

('55', 121, 7, 10, 239475) The left hand cannot write as fast as the right hand can.
('55', 121, 7, 11, 239533) True, Mahadevs help will be available, but dictating to him will be a new practice so far as letters written from jail are concerned.
('55', 121, 7, 12, 239667) I shall see how far I can follow that practice.
('55', 121, 7, 13, 239715) I shall have to observe whether I feel at ease in dictating Ietters which are prompted purely by love.
('55', 121, 7, 14, 239818) I will certainly dictate letters of business.
('55', 121, 7, 15, 239864) I was not in the least pained by your letter.
('55', 121, 7, 16, 239910) All of us must grow or deteriorate in some measure every day.
('55', 121, 7, 17, 239972) Nothing remains unchanging.
('55', 121, 8, 18, 240000) When I take the blame upon myself, I do not act out of false humility and do not exaggerate.
('55', 121, 8, 19, 240093) My taking the blame upon myself does not mean that others are exonerated.
('55', 121, 8, 20, 240167) But the leader must take the discredit for failure as he does the credit for success.
('55', 121, 8, 21, 240253) I accept the need for inter caste marriages up to a certain point.
('55', 121, 8, 22, 240320) If a husband has the right to divorce his wife, a wife should also have the right to divorce her husband.
('55', 121, 8, 23, 240426) But generally I am against the practice of divorce.
('55', 121, 8, 24, 240478) The bond of love ought to be indissoluble.
('55', 121, 8, 25, 240521) Boys and girls may be educated either separately or together.
('55', 121, 8, 26, 240583) It depends on the subject of study.
('55', 121, 8, 27, 240619) They will have to study law together.
('55', 121, 8, 28, 240657) I cannot lay down in this matter one single rule which can be followed in all countries and in all circumstances.
('55', 121, 8, 29, 240771) The problem is not a simple one.
('55', 121, 8, 30, 240804) No one has been able to demonstrate decisive results in any country in this field.
('55', 121, 8, 31, 240887) The whole matter is in an experimental stage.
('55', 121, 9, 32, 240933) 1 In her reply to Gandhijis letter dated February 25 (vide Letter to Premabehn Kantak, 25 2 1932.), the addressee had stated that if Gandhiji had stopped growing in stature whether in or out of jail, she would admire him less.

('55', 122, 7, 10, 241615) But those who dream, in the delirium of their joy, of building a flight of steps to reach the constellations live in ignorance.
('55', 122, 7, 11, 241743) I liked the curriculum 2. I dont think I can suggest just now any changes or improvements in it.
('55', 122, 7, 12, 241840) As regards Japan and China, our sympathy is bound to be on the side of the latter.
('55', 122, 7, 13, 241923) But the real position seems to be as I have described it in my letter to a child.
('55', 122, 7, 14, 242005) What you write about Jamnadas is true.
('55', 122, 7, 15, 242044) He seems troubled in mind but keeps his problem to himself.
('55', 122, 7, 16, 242104) If Sushila 3 can understand what troubles him, something can be done to help him.

('55', 122, 10, 20, 242431) 4 God has given us the various abilities to control them, and some to suppress them altogether.
('55', 122, 10, 21, 242527) He has given us a mouth not to go on speaking in season and out of season, but to speak for doing Gods work.
('55', 122, 10, 22, 242636) God has given us abilities for doing both good and evil but we have to get rid of the evil impulses completely.

('55', 123, 3, 6, 243250) But since you have asked me to write to you every week, I have written this letter.
('55', 123, 3, 7, 243334) However, in future bear in mind what I have said.

('55', 123, 7, 11, 243567) March 14, 1932
('55', 123, 8, 12, 243582) DEAR BOYS AND GIRLS, I got your letter.
('55', 123, 8, 13, 243622) It is not right for a brahmachari to attend to several things at a time.
('55', 123, 8, 14, 243695) He takes up only one thing at a time and concentrates all the energy of his body and mind on that thing.
('55', 123, 8, 15, 243800) If, therefore, you are occupied in manual work and there is no necessity for you to talk about anything relating to it, the proper thing would be to remain silent.
('55', 123, 8, 16, 243964) However, if we are playing or have gone out for a walk, talking is a part of the activity and so we can talk at that time.
('55', 123, 8, 17, 244087) Anybody who regulates his life strictly according to this principle, can make it full of interest.
('55', 123, 8, 18, 244186) And an institution where people work in complete silence and speak only when necessary impresses us as a very quiet place.
('55', 123, 8, 19, 244309) Not only do I see no harm in the girls putting on shorts and a shirt when doing exercises and also at other times, but I actually like the thing.
('55', 123, 8, 20, 244455) For the Ashram residents their goal in life has already been fixed, and it is that they are dedicated to the quest for truth.
('55', 123, 8, 21, 244581) To your question whether one should or should not aim to be like a soldier, I shall give an answer after you tell me in your next letter what all of you understand to be the meaning of the word soldier.
('55', 124, 0, 1, 244784) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 125
('55', 124, 1, 2, 244830) After travelling in many countries, I have found India to be the most beautiful country.
('55', 124, 1, 3, 244919) But since I am free, as I believe, from blind partiality, I have always been able to see much good in every country and so have found them all to be good and have appreciated the special excellence of each of them.
('55', 124, 1, 4, 245134) On the whole, however, I have felt that India is not inferior to any other country, that one finds in it all that one may want and that what one does not find in India is not quite essential for our life.
('55', 124, 1, 5, 245339) If the Ashram has money to spare and if the things are not likely to cost much, even at such a time as the present I would have no objection to having swings and slides made for you.
('55', 124, 1, 6, 245522) You should, however, bear one thing in mind, namely, that the Ashram should always be a poor peoples institution, and that just because the Ashram has the necessary money we will not be justified in getting anything we want.
('55', 124, 1, 7, 245747) And even things which befit poor people may be ordered only if the Ashram has the necessary funds.
('55', 124, 1, 8, 245846) The question, therefore, is only whether we can afford a thing and whether it is in keeping with our aim.

('55', 125, 2, 3, 246531) March 14, 1932
('55', 125, 3, 4, 246546) As we know, Imam Saheb had set much store by patriotic considerations in arranging the marriages of his two daughters.
('55', 125, 3, 5, 246665) He wanted to marry them to young men who would devote themselves to the service of the country, would make no difference between Hindus and Muslims and who would, by their manner of living, do honour to the Ashram ideal of life.
('55', 125, 3, 6, 246894) And so he selected two Gujarati Muslims from families of average means.
('55', 125, 3, 7, 246966) My first meeting with Imam Saheb may be said to have taken place in 1903 in South Africa after my return to that country.
('55', 125, 3, 8, 247088) He used to tell me that we had met once before that but I have no recollection of that meeting.
('55', 125, 3, 9, 247184) When I set up practice as a lawyer in Johannesburg, he used to accompany clients to my office.
('55', 125, 3, 10, 247279) He was an altogether different man then in appearance and manners.
('55', 125, 3, 11, 247346) He used to dress himself in English style, and wore a Turkish cap.
('55', 125, 3, 12, 247413) I immediately recognized his intelligence, but otherwise he did not produce a good impression on me at first.
('55', 125, 3, 13, 247523) I thought him rather obstinate, but, as I came to know him better, I liked him more and more.
('55', 125, 3, 14, 247617) I saw, as I had more and more experience of dealing with him, that what I had thought to be obstinacy was only his eagerness to understand fully the implications of every point.
('55', 125, 3, 15, 247795) If he held an opinion on any matter, he would not give it up till his reason was convinced of his error.
('55', 125, 3, 16, 247900) He would not take a lawyers word as gospel truth in legal matters merely because he himself was not a lawyer, but would argue against him even in such matters.
('55', 125, 3, 17, 248060) Though he had had no education, he had complete confidence in his judgement.
('55', 125, 3, 18, 248137) Moreover, he had a proud sense of self respect.
('55', 125, 3, 19, 248185) I, therefore, saw very soon that he had sufficient strength of mind to cling to his own view without being overawed by anybody.
('55', 125, 3, 20, 248313) In the beginning, Imam Saheb used to come to me on behalf of clients and explain their cases to me.
('55', 125, 3, 21, 248413) But he took interest in current affairs and would draw me into discussion about them.
('55', 125, 3, 22, 248499) He evinced keen interest in discussing the hardships of our countrymen in South
('55', 125, 4, 23, 248579) 1 This was sent along with Letter to Narandas Gandhi; vide the following item.

('55', 126, 1, 2, 248704) Africa and took part in the meetings, etc.
('55', 126, 1, 3, 248747) On most issues he supportedme, but he never hesitated to oppose me even in public whenever he did not approve of my stand.
('55', 126, 1, 4, 248870) Gradually, however, he was drawn towards me and, when the satyagraha commenced, proved himself as steadfast as a rock.
('55', 126, 1, 5, 248989) Some fell and some weakened, and some opposed me bitterly, but I dont remember Imam Saheb to have wavered at any time.
('55', 126, 1, 6, 249108) When he was imprisoned for the first time, nobody expected that he would remain strong till the end.
('55', 126, 1, 7, 249209) On the contrary, many persons told me, including some who held him in high respect, that he would not go to jail again, that he had a delicate constitution, was pleasure loving and had many wants.
('55', 126, 1, 8, 249406) This was on the whole true.
('55', 126, 1, 9, 249434) However, Imam Saheb never weakened, whereas I saw many who were known to be simple in their habits withdrawing from the struggle.
('55', 126, 1, 10, 249564) Imam Sahebs capacity for self sacrifice was very great, and, though he would think long before taking a decision, he showed wonderful strength in clinging to a decision once taken.
('55', 126, 1, 11, 249745) When Imam Saheb plunged into the struggle, he had no thought at all that he would have to break up his home and embrace a life of complete renunciation.
('55', 126, 1, 12, 249898) As soon, however, as he saw that if he wished to remain staunch in the satyagraha movement he would have to give up the attachment to his home, he did so almost in an instant.
('55', 126, 1, 13, 250074) This was no small sacrifice on his part.

('55', 126, 4, 16, 250190) Monday, March 14, 1932
('55', 126, 5, 17, 250213) NARANDAS, Mahadev has joined me in the nick of time for my right hand has just gone out of service.
('55', 126, 5, 18, 250313) By this I do not meant that it is continually paining, but I certainly mean that it would start doing so if I went on writing with it or doing any other work.
('55', 126, 5, 19, 250472) It may even happen that I shall never be able now to do much work with it, for, I see that, though I gave it complete rest during the return voyage from England, it has not recovered sufficiently well so that I could resume working with it.
('55', 126, 5, 20, 250713) We need not feel sorry even if it becomes useless for ever.
('55', 126, 5, 21, 250773) Sooner or later all the bodily organs will have become weak.
('55', 126, 5, 22, 250834) We need not, therefore, feel concerned when we see them gradually becoming so.
('55', 126, 5, 23, 250913) It is no small grace of God that I have taken from
('55', 127, 0, 1, 250964) 128 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 127, 1, 2, 251006) theright hand the service which I have done.
('55', 127, 1, 3, 251051) And, after all, as our [spiritual] dictionary 1 tells us, it is He who takes work from us, and He will do so as long as He wills and on His own condition.
('55', 127, 1, 4, 251206) Our hands and feet are His tools, and it will be enough if we knowingly do nothing to impair their efficiency.
('55', 127, 1, 5, 251317) We were foolish to the extent that we misused them in the past.
('55', 127, 1, 6, 251381) It is because we misuse our body that, when what we call old age arrives, our limbs and organs begin to decay.
('55', 127, 1, 7, 251492) To one who has never misused his bodily organs, old age will not be painful but, on the contrary, it will bring happiness.
('55', 127, 1, 8, 251615) If trees were thinking beings, we can easily see that they would feel no pain when their fruits, fully ripe, fell to the ground.
('55', 127, 1, 9, 251744) Rather, the knowledge that these fruits would be used by human beings would make them happy.
('55', 127, 1, 10, 251837) Similarly, he whose life is good must feel confident that when old age has worn out the strength of his body, his new condition will serve some greater good.
('55', 127, 1, 11, 251995) But, as things are, all this seems to us as mere wise talk, for we see no instances in the world, or very few, of perfectly happy old age.
('55', 127, 1, 12, 252134) Similarly, we rarely see a person who welcomes his death as a friend.
('55', 127, 1, 13, 252204) The health of all three of us may be described as good.
('55', 127, 1, 14, 252260) It is true that Mahadev has been suffering pain in the bone of one of his legs, but rest and sun bath will probably cure it.
('55', 127, 1, 15, 252385) There is no cause for worry.
('55', 127, 1, 16, 252414) You have given no news about Khushalbhai during the past week.
('55', 127, 1, 17, 252477) I infer from this that the cloud has dispersed for the time being.
('55', 127, 1, 18, 252544) The position about visitors is still not clear.
('55', 127, 1, 19, 252592) It is not improbable that the practice may have to be stopped.
('55', 127, 1, 20, 252655) However, I believe Jaisukhlal, Kashi, Lakshmi and Moti will have come and seen me in a day or two.
('55', 127, 1, 21, 252754) Haridas Gandhi 2 has been brought here.
('55', 127, 1, 22, 252794) He is still in the hospital.
('55', 127, 1, 23, 252823) We get reports about his health from time to time, but none of us has yet been able to see him.
('55', 127, 1, 24, 252919) Ramdas came and saw me.
('55', 127, 1, 25, 252943) Most probably I shall be able to see the others too.
('55', 127, 1, 26, 252996) I had expected a letter from Mirabehn, but I have received none so far.
('55', 127, 1, 27, 253068) It was reported in the newspapers that Gangabehn Jhaveri has been released.
('55', 127, 1, 28, 253144) It seems somebody paid the fine on her behalf.
('55', 127, 1, 29, 253191) Who was that person?
('55', 127, 1, 30, 253212) Do you get any news about Prabhavati?

('55', 128, 2, 10, 254018) If I can know how it is made and in what proportion the ingredients are mixed, we may be able to make it here.
('55', 128, 2, 11, 254129) It does not seem proper that you should send a parcel of the thing from there periodically, and even if I dont mind your doing so I must know the quantities of the ingredients, for otherwise I can not judge how much of the preparation I should eat daily.
('55', 128, 2, 12, 254384) I had read in the papers about Brijkishan 2.

('55', 128, 7, 18, 254609) I would prefer Madhavdas to Madhavlal.

('55', 129, 6, 12, 255442) I was glad that the marriage ceremony was simple.
('55', 129, 6, 13, 255492) Did you go for the ceremony alone or were you accompanied by any elders?
('55', 129, 6, 14, 255565) Manilal does not seem to have arrived last week, but there was a letter from him in which he said that he would be positively here in a fortnight or two.

('55', 129, 11, 25, 256141) I will make todays letter brief.
('55', 129, 11, 26, 256174) It is not good that your Association has not been working.
('55', 129, 11, 27, 256233) Even though your number has become small, it would be good if you can run the Association.
('55', 129, 11, 28, 256324) Its usefulness may not be apparent now, andit is also likely that there would be obstacles of various kinds in the beginning.
('55', 129, 11, 29, 256450) However, if you persist and carry it on, it is bound to prove useful.
('55', 129, 11, 30, 256520) To do so, you should find out collective activities, no

('55', 130, 1, 3, 256923) This does not at all mean that you are merely to add one more activity to several others; it means that the Association should take upon itself one or more of the activities being conducted at present.
('55', 130, 1, 4, 257125) Do not fall a victim to the false notion that women cannot work as a team.
('55', 130, 1, 5, 257200) I wrote to you earlier how much the women in other countries are able to do.

('55', 130, 6, 15, 257635) That your request for blessings comes on a printed card makes the request purely formal and to that extent it loses its value.
('55', 130, 6, 16, 257762) If blessings are worth soliciting, they are worth soliciting in a self written letter, which should also state some good resolutions made by the couple to mark the auspicious event.

('55', 131, 8, 12, 258843) I was thankful for the permission to see my son Ramdas Gandhi whilst the whole of my request was under consideration.
('55', 131, 8, 13, 258961) It is high time however that an early decision was given.
('55', 131, 8, 14, 259019) The matter has for me assumed extraordinary urgency because a co prisoner Haridas Gandhi is seriously ill and has lost considerable weight.
('55', 131, 8, 15, 259159) He has lived for a long time at the Ashram.
('55', 131, 8, 16, 259203) I believe that I exercise greater influence over him than his father and I know that the very fact of my seeing him will put life into him.
('55', 131, 8, 17, 259343) I would like the Government to realize that young men like Haridas who have come under my influence are no less to me than Ramdas Gandhi.
('55', 131, 8, 18, 259481) It is impossible for me therefore to be at ease whilst this matter of seeing the fellow prisoners is hanging fire, especially in view of serious illness of Sjt.

('55', 132, 2, 3, 260148) March 16, 1932 It is possible and necessary to treat human beings on terms of equality, but this can never apply to their morals 1. One would be affectionate and attentive to a rascal and to a saint; but one cannot and must not put saintliness and rascality on the same footing.

('55', 132, 6, 7, 260511) RAIHANA, I got your card.
('55', 132, 6, 8, 260537) In the letter which has been lost in transit, I had asked you whether there was any rule regarding the use of ze, and se, sin, hai, he.
('55', 132, 6, 9, 260673) For example, why should khaas be spelt with swad and why not with se or sin.
('55', 132, 6, 10, 260750) Why sin and not swad in salaam?
('55', 132, 6, 11, 260782) Or why not se?
('55', 132, 6, 12, 260797) In spelling galat, why toi and not te?
('55', 132, 6, 13, 260836) Then I had copied the following ghazal:
('55', 132, 7, 14, 260876) Life in this world called beautiful garden is only for a short while; you will enjoy the spectacle for a few days only.
('55', 132, 7, 15, 260996) O traveller, prepare for the march; residence on earth is short.
('55', 132, 7, 16, 261061) When the great Hakim Lukman was asked, How long will you live?rubbing his hands in despair he replied: Only a few days. After burial the angel of death said in the grave: You will sleep here only for a few days. 2
('55', 132, 8, 17, 261275) I trust you will consider this much enough for today, seeing that writing with the left hand takes time.
('55', 132, 8, 18, 261380) The Urdu handwriting is of course very bad, but I am sure you will have no difficulty in deciphering it.
('55', 132, 8, 19, 261485) Mahadev has now been brought to stay with us here.
('55', 132, 8, 20, 261536) He remembers your [favourite] bhajan Awake and arise, O traveller! Once it was even sung at prayer time.
('55', 132, 8, 21, 261641) Next time I shall send it to you in Urdu script.
('55', 132, 8, 22, 261690) Are you quite well?

('55', 133, 6, 12, 262437) But there are many Ashram inmates in that ward.
('55', 133, 6, 13, 262485) I would therefore for the time being drop out Sjt.

('55', 133, 11, 21, 262814) They may do so now.
('55', 133, 11, 22, 262834) The present position is that those inmates of the Ashram who do not take part in political activities can visit me.
('55', 133, 11, 23, 262950) About others, correspondence is going on.
('55', 133, 11, 24, 262992) Only those who are regularly engaged in Congress work can be described as taking part in political activities.
('55', 133, 11, 25, 263103) According to this criterion, only Mahadev, Devdas and Pyarelal can be described as doing that.
('55', 133, 11, 26, 263198) To some extent Valji also may be classed with them, but none of the others.
('55', 133, 11, 27, 263274) However, those who are carrying on picketing at present must be described [as political].
('55', 133, 11, 28, 263364) Since the whole business is left to my good faith, the final responsibility rests on me.

('55', 135, 3, 4, 265041) CHI., When manure is spread in the field, it becomes fine earth and the gases which are generated in the process serve as food for the trees.
('55', 135, 3, 5, 265183) Similarly, so long as the saliva remains in the mouth and the mouth is healthy, it helps to digest food.

('55', 135, 3, 7, 265334) Mixing with dust, it breeds germs.

('55', 136, 2, 3, 266183) March 20, 1932
('55', 136, 3, 4, 266198) CHI., It is true that in many places people take more freedom than is proper.
('55', 136, 3, 5, 266276) Such things always happen whenever there is popular awakening.
('55', 136, 3, 6, 266339) Self control cannot be forced on anybody.
('55', 136, 3, 7, 266381) We should be strict in our own conduct and be liberal towards others.
('55', 136, 3, 8, 266451) What we regard as excessive freedom may, however, be moderation for those concerned.
('55', 136, 3, 9, 266536) One person may take milk as medicine and another may consume it to pamper himself.
('55', 136, 3, 10, 266619) Such things happen every day.

('55', 136, 8, 15, 266769) GANGABEHN (JHAVERI), Narandas must have explained to you the whole position regarding your coming to see me.
('55', 136, 8, 16, 266878) The Governments order on the subject means that those who have been taking active part in the struggle cannot come.
('55', 136, 8, 17, 266994) This does not apply to relations.
('55', 136, 8, 18, 267028) I dont regard this issue as worth fighting for and, therefore, I think I should be satisfied with the facility which they permit.
('55', 136, 8, 19, 267158) You may write a letter and say in it what you wish to, or send a message with somebody else who may be coming.
('55', 136, 8, 20, 267269) You cannot ask me anything concerning the struggle.
('55', 136, 8, 21, 267321) A prisoner has no right, and is not fit, to express any opinion about anything concerning himself.
('55', 136, 8, 22, 267420) How did you keep in jail?
('55', 136, 8, 23, 267446) Narrate your experience.

('55', 137, 3, 5, 267780) You will see caves and many other things besides.
('55', 137, 3, 6, 267830) But there are many interesting things to see all around us, and we can see them even today.

('55', 137, 3, 8, 268000) Have you learnt to look at the sky?

('55', 137, 10, 17, 268534) PARASRAM, Brushing the teeth with datan 1 should be supplemented by the use of fingers.
('55', 137, 10, 18, 268622) That is, rub the gums vigorously with the fingers while gargling after you have brushed the teeth with datan and cleansed the tongue with the twig.
('55', 137, 10, 19, 268770) One suffering from pyorrhoea should brush theteeth with datan twice daily, and I would not think it too much to give half an hour each time.
('55', 137, 10, 20, 268911) I have come across negroes brushing their teeth at all times in the day.
('55', 137, 10, 21, 268984) The benefit from the use of datan is
('55', 137, 11, 22, 269021) 1 Same as datun; vide Letter to Tulsi Maher, 24 1 1932
('55', 138, 0, 1, 269076) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 139
('55', 138, 1, 2, 269122) not merely that the teeth are brushed with it, but also that all the poisonous matter in the gums is thrown out with the fluids discharged from the mouth while crushing the datan, as we spit out the fluids entirely.
('55', 138, 1, 3, 269338) I myself use nothing else except common salt with the datan.
('55', 138, 1, 4, 269399) Of course, my brushing the teeth does not mean much, because I have not a single tooth left in the upper jaw and even in the lower only a few remain.
('55', 138, 1, 5, 269549) Both the babul and the neem twigs are good for datan but perhaps the neem is likely to be better for one suffering from pyorrhoea as the bitterness of the neem is highly beneficial.
('55', 138, 1, 6, 269731) There is not the slightest need for the girls to use a fountain pen.
('55', 138, 1, 7, 269800) Really speaking, nobody in the Ashram should need a fountain pen.
('55', 138, 1, 8, 269866) Why should anybody be in such hurry?
('55', 138, 1, 9, 269903) For students at any rate, it is certainly a harmful thing to use.
('55', 138, 1, 10, 269969) The reed pen is the best for writing Gujarati, Hindi, Urdu and other Indian scripts.
('55', 138, 1, 11, 270054) We should teach the children to use it properly.
('55', 138, 1, 12, 270103) During prayers at the Ashram, none should start reciting or singing before the leader begins.
('55', 138, 1, 13, 270197) And again, the rule is that when he leads, only those can join in the recitation or singing who can do so in tune.
('55', 138, 1, 14, 270312) When the whole community sings harmoniously in one tune, their singing never fails to produce an effect.
('55', 138, 1, 15, 270417) Nor does silence fail.
('55', 138, 1, 16, 270440) Both are beneficial, each in its proper place.
('55', 138, 1, 17, 270487) In offering oblations, etc., at a sacrifice, the incantations used to be chanted aloud in the belief that thousands were witnessing the ceremony with reverence.
('55', 138, 1, 18, 270648) Once that became a custom, even when only five or ten persons are present the incantations at a sacrifice continue to be chanted aloud.
('55', 138, 1, 19, 270784) The observance of one principal vow mostly includes that of several minor ones.
('55', 138, 1, 20, 270864) Just as a neem tree comes out of another neem tree, so human beings are born from human beings, and just as the general properties of the neem are transmitted from one to another, so are those of human beings.
('55', 138, 1, 21, 271074) But because of several other factors which also operate, the transmission of all characteristics is not, as it should not be, maintained.
('55', 138, 1, 22, 271212) Moreover, we observe certain peculiarities in man also because of the difference that exists between man and other living creatures.

('55', 139, 8, 21, 272293) They should not play for stakes.

('55', 140, 1, 2, 272498) 151. IMAM SAHEB III 1
('55', 140, 2, 3, 272520) March 21, 1932
('55', 140, 3, 4, 272535) We should remember that Imam Saheb had set up his home in English style.
('55', 140, 3, 5, 272608) Haji Saheba had lived in that style from her very birth.
('55', 140, 3, 6, 272665) Fatima and Amina also were brought up like English children.
('55', 140, 3, 7, 272726) For one who had lived in this manner, it was extremely difficult to curtail his heavy expenditure and adopt an utterly simple mode of life.
('55', 140, 3, 8, 272866) For Imam Saheb, however, once he had made up his mind to do a particular thing, it was quite easy to carry out his resolve.
('55', 140, 3, 9, 272990) And, therefore, when I decided to leave Johannesburg and to settle in Phoenix, he himself proposed that he, too, would live there.
('55', 140, 3, 10, 273121) Though I knew his firmness of mind, I was completely at a loss what to say in reply to his proposal.
('55', 140, 3, 11, 273222) I described to him the hardships of life in Phoenix.
('55', 140, 3, 12, 273275) A man who had never put his body to the slightest trouble and had always lived surrounded by comforts and luxuries, I wondered how such a person would be able to start forthwith living like a labourer.
('55', 140, 3, 13, 273477) Even if he himself could bear the hardships of life in Phoenix, what about Haji Saheba, and Fatima and Amina, I asked.
('55', 140, 3, 14, 273596) Imam Sahebs reply was brief.
('55', 140, 3, 15, 273625) He said: I have put my trust in God.
('55', 140, 3, 16, 273662) And you do not know Haji Saheba.
('55', 140, 3, 17, 273695) She will always be ready to live where I live, and as I live.
('55', 140, 3, 18, 273757) If, therefore, you have no other difficulty in the matter, I have decided to come and live in Phoenix.
('55', 140, 3, 19, 273860) No one knows when the struggle will end.
('55', 140, 3, 20, 273901) I dont think I shall be able to carry on my old business of supplying coaches on hire, or take up any other occupation.
('55', 140, 3, 21, 274021) Like you, I too have realized that a satyagrahi should give up love of wealth and possessions. Imam Sahebs proposal pleased me very much.
('55', 140, 3, 22, 274159) I wrote to my co workers in Phoenix.
('55', 140, 3, 23, 274196) They also welcomed the proposal.
('55', 140, 3, 24, 274229) And so Imam Saheb and his family came over.
('55', 140, 3, 25, 274273) Many inmates of the Ashram probably do not know that Imam Saheb joined the residents of Phoenix in all their activities.
('55', 140, 3, 26, 274394) Everybody fetched water for his or her own use from a spring below.
('55', 140, 3, 27, 274462) It flowed at some depth below the level of the Phoenix Settlement.
('55', 140, 3, 28, 274529) The Phoenix buildings were on a hill and one had to climb about fifty feet to reach the place.
('55', 140, 3, 29, 274624) Imam Saheb had a delicate constitution even atthat time, but
('55', 140, 4, 30, 274685) 1 This was sent along with Letter to Narandas Gandhi; vide the following item.
('55', 141, 0, 1, 274764) 142 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 141, 1, 2, 274806) every morning one saw him walking down to the spring with a kavad 1
('55', 141, 2, 3, 274874) on his shoulders and climbing up slowly with the buckets filled with water.
('55', 141, 2, 4, 274950) The place now occupied by the spinning wheel in the Ashram was held in Phoenix by the printing press.
('55', 141, 2, 5, 275052) All the inmates, boys and girls, old men and women, educated and uneducated, had to work in some department of the press.
('55', 141, 2, 6, 275174) There were all kinds of big or small tasks, composing, folding the printed copies of the paper, making wrappers, pasting stamps, moving the wheel with the hand whenever the machine stopped, etc., etc.
('55', 141, 2, 7, 275375) Everybody was required to give some time and help in these tasks, especially on the day on which the journal was to be published.
('55', 141, 2, 8, 275505) Imam Saheb, Haji Saheba, Fatima and Amina, all four of them joined in this work.
('55', 141, 2, 9, 275586) Imam Saheb had learned composing.
('55', 141, 2, 10, 275620) For a man of his temper and habits and of his age, this was indeed wonderful.
('55', 141, 2, 11, 275698) In this way, Imam Saheb identified himself completely with the life at Phoenix.
('55', 141, 2, 12, 275778) He and the other members of his family were non vegetarian, but I dont remember any time when they cooked such food at Phoenix.
('55', 141, 2, 13, 275906) This, however, does not mean that Imam Saheb was in any way a less devout Muslim.
('55', 141, 2, 14, 275988) He never missed namaz, nor did he or his family ever fail to observe the roza.
('55', 141, 2, 15, 276067) By adopting the manner of life of the other inmates and making a sacrifice for their sake, he really demonstrated the nobility of Islamic culture.
('55', 141, 2, 16, 276214) Imam Sahebs capacity for self sacrifice was to be put to a still severe test.
('55', 141, 2, 17, 276292) He went to jail again several times, and proved himself a model prisoner.
('55', 141, 2, 18, 276366) When, however, in the year 1914 it was decided that most of the inmates of the Ashram should return to India, leaving only a few of them in Phoenix, Imam Saheb was put to a real test.
('55', 141, 2, 19, 276550) South Africa had practically become his home.
('55', 141, 2, 20, 276596) Haji Saheba, Fatima and Amina were complete strangers to India and did not know any Indian languagea little English and Dutch was all the language that they knew.
('55', 141, 2, 21, 276759) But Imam Saheb took no time to come to a decision.
('55', 141, 2, 22, 276810) He had made up his mind that he and his family would live wherever I did.
('55', 141, 2, 23, 276884) That was his self sacrifice for the cause of satyagraha and his contribution towards Hindu Muslim unity.
('55', 141, 2, 24, 276989) All the inmates of the Ashram know about his life after his coming to India.
('55', 141, 2, 25, 277066) I am convinced that he was rising higher day by day: his heart was becoming purer, his devotion to God was

('55', 142, 1, 2, 277319) becomingdeeper and his faith in the Ashram rules also was increasing.
('55', 142, 1, 3, 277389) But it is not my intention here to give reminiscences of his life in India.
('55', 142, 1, 4, 277465) I should like everybody who came into close contact with Imam Saheb to write down his experiences, and all such accounts to be put together with these reminiscences.

('55', 142, 4, 7, 277706) March 19/21, 1932
('55', 142, 5, 8, 277724) NARANDAS, I wrote a letter 1 to you yesterday and handed it over today for posting.
('55', 142, 5, 9, 277808) I hope you will get it in time.
('55', 142, 5, 10, 277840) It contains detailed instructions regarding visits and Champa.
('55', 142, 5, 11, 277903) In this letter, therefore, I dont say anything about these matters.
('55', 142, 5, 12, 277971) That letter also contains something more.
('55', 142, 5, 13, 278013) I saw Haridas Gandhi, Chhaganlal and Narasinhbhai today.
('55', 142, 5, 14, 278070) I shall now be able to see three [prisoners] every fortnight, and in this way I shall be able to know the conditions of the co workers who are lodged in this jail and help them whenever I can.
('55', 142, 5, 15, 278263) Haridas is considerably reduced, but his illness is more mental than physical.
('55', 142, 5, 16, 278342) He is being well looked after.
('55', 142, 5, 17, 278373) You will learn more details from my letter to Kamala.
('55', 142, 5, 18, 278427) If she wants to come and see Haridas, she may do so.
('55', 142, 5, 19, 278480) If she comes on a day on which other inmates of the Ashram are visiting me and her name is included in the five, she will be able to see both of us.
('55', 142, 5, 20, 278629) Hemprabhadevi frequently writes to me directly, and I also reply to her directly.

('55', 142, 5, 22, 278799) Let me hear whenever you get any news about Janakibehn and Jamnalal, though I believe Madanmohan 2 also will write to me from time to time.
('55', 142, 5, 23, 278939) I take it that Chimanlals operation is over.
('55', 142, 5, 24, 278984) Who performed it?

('55', 142, 5, 26, 279050) Take prompt measures and cure your scabies.
('55', 142, 5, 27, 279094) The application of the wet sheet pack is bound to cure it.
('55', 142, 5, 28, 279153) I dont know what advice I should give you regarding the land in Bidaj.

('55', 143, 2, 7, 279536) If he falls ill repeatedly for want of meat in his diet, and if he wishes to have it, we should inquire and find a place where he can get it.
('55', 143, 2, 8, 279678) If you dont approve of this, let me know.
('55', 143, 2, 9, 279720) I did this [in the past] for two or three co workers.
('55', 143, 2, 10, 279774) It is not, therefore, anything unusual which I am suggesting.
('55', 143, 2, 11, 279836) You should, if necessary, even free Hariyomal from active work and force him to attend to the improvement of his health.
('55', 143, 2, 12, 279957) What do you intend to do about Daya, who is being called away by her father?
('55', 143, 2, 13, 280034) You must have read my letter to her.

('55', 143, 6, 18, 280258) March 21, 1932
('55', 143, 7, 19, 280273) DEAR BOYS AND GIRLS, There is of course no sin if one has to go to answer calls of nature during the hours for manual work, but it is certainly a bad habit.
('55', 143, 7, 20, 280430) A boy or girl who feels interested in such work should attend to calls before joining it.
('55', 143, 7, 21, 280520) Moreover, one who has a fixed time for such calls would always go at that time.
('55', 143, 7, 22, 280600) If the hours for manual work come together, then a person would certainly have to go during that period.
('55', 143, 7, 23, 280705) For this reason, manual work is never prescribed for more than four consecutive hours.
('55', 143, 7, 24, 280792) Spinning is primarily an education, for it arouses in us a sense of the duty of service, we learn in it a very useful occupation and there is beautiful art in it.
('55', 143, 7, 25, 280955) One never goes to join any work unless the wish is there.
('55', 143, 7, 26, 281013) But children who are not properly trained never feel the desire to do a good thing.
('55', 143, 7, 27, 281097) The best rule, therefore, is to join in good work whether
('55', 143, 8, 28, 281155) 1 For the article Imam Saheb III which followed, vide the preceding item.
('55', 144, 0, 1, 281229) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 145
('55', 144, 1, 2, 281275) the desire is there or not.
('55', 144, 1, 3, 281303) A child who does this regularly comes to like the work in course of time, that is, he feels a desire to join it.
('55', 144, 1, 4, 281416) If we always follow only our desires, we would become self indulgent.We should try our best to save ourselves from that fate.
('55', 144, 1, 5, 281542) You may say of me that my favourite subjects were languages and geometry.
('55', 144, 1, 6, 281616) You can come when Narandas permits you to do so, but it would be good if you control your desire to come.
('55', 144, 1, 7, 281722) Remember that we are poor, wish to remain so and aspire to vie with our starving countrymen.
('55', 144, 1, 8, 281815) I will now narrate an incident.
('55', 144, 1, 9, 281847) I see here with my own eyes something I had formerly heard about.
('55', 144, 1, 10, 281913) We have here a cat which, when it wants to answer natures call, goes to a place where it would not be observed by anybody.
('55', 144, 1, 11, 282036) It finds for the purpose a dusty spot and, after answering the call, scratches the ground and covers up the faeces with earth.
('55', 144, 1, 12, 282163) After doing that, the cat sniffs at the spot and, if there is the slightest smell, it throws more earth on the spot.
('55', 144, 1, 13, 282280) On seeing this, I asked myself: Do all of us cover up the excreta as carefully as this cat does? We daily bow to Mother Earth and ask her forgiveness for walking on her with our feet; but do we cover up the ground after spitting, blowing our nose or passing urine, etc.?
('55', 144, 1, 14, 282551) Those who have not been observing this rule should start doing so immediately.

('55', 144, 5, 19, 282837) As one should not eat hastily, so also one should not write in a hurry.
('55', 144, 5, 20, 282909) The ideal is to avoid haste in all matters.
('55', 144, 5, 21, 282953) If a person has to do anything in haste, that means that he has been too slow before.
('55', 144, 5, 22, 283039) Non attachment and haste cannot go with each other.

('55', 145, 3, 4, 283277) BHAI, We did expect a letter from you.
('55', 145, 3, 5, 283316) All those who are born do not reach maturity.
('55', 145, 3, 6, 283362) 1 Moreover, when an epidemic breaks out the death rate goes up.
('55', 145, 3, 7, 283426) Hence I am not surprised by what you write.
('55', 145, 3, 8, 283470) It is a wonder and a matter of joy that the death rate has not been higher.
('55', 145, 3, 9, 283546) And, in any case, why should we grieve over death?
('55', 145, 3, 10, 283597) The death of one who is fit to die may deserve to be welcomed.
('55', 145, 3, 11, 283660) Moreover, is it not true that people die only to be born again?
('55', 145, 3, 12, 283724) Hence, there is no reason for sorrow at all.
('55', 145, 3, 13, 283769) One who has not learnt the art of going his way alone may be upset by external events.
('55', 145, 3, 14, 283856) But only they who are strong enough to stand alone will realize the God of Truth.

('55', 146, 3, 4, 284483) CHI., Do you remember my definition of God?
('55', 146, 3, 5, 284527) Instead of saying that God is Truth, I say that Truth is God.
('55', 146, 3, 6, 284589) I did not always think thus.
('55', 146, 3, 7, 284618) I realized this only four years ago.
('55', 146, 3, 8, 284655) But without knowing it I always acted as if it was so.
('55', 146, 3, 9, 284710) I have always known God as Truth.
('55', 146, 3, 10, 284744) There was a time when I doubted the existence of God, but even at that time I did not doubt the existence of Truth.
('55', 146, 3, 11, 284860) This Truth is not a material quality but is pure consciousness.
('55', 146, 3, 12, 284924) That alone holds the universe together.
('55', 146, 3, 13, 284964) It is God because it rules the whole universe.
('55', 146, 3, 14, 285011) If you follow this idea, it contains the answer to all your other questions.
('55', 146, 3, 15, 285088) If you have any difficulty, however, put your question to me.
('55', 146, 3, 16, 285150) For me this is almost a matter of direct experience.
('55', 146, 3, 17, 285203) I say almost because I have not seen face to face God Who is Truth.
('55', 146, 3, 18, 285271) I have had only a glimpse of Him.

('55', 148, 1, 5, 287326) Nothing has come with me which had no historical value.
('55', 148, 1, 6, 287382) Just now, therefore, everything should be kept in a safe place.
('55', 148, 1, 7, 287446) Those articles which you think can be utilized may be used.
('55', 148, 1, 8, 287506) Abhiman in the sense of firm determination is necessary in regard to yajna, but abhiman in the sense of pridethat pride which makes you think how strong you are and feel confident that you will never miss your yajnasuch Abhiman should be shunned.
('55', 148, 1, 9, 287753) I would have to answer your question about Meghji 1 only if I claimed that I could not be bound by human attachments.
('55', 148, 1, 10, 287871) We may try to free ourselves from their bondage, but should not give up tender ness of heart or our desire to serve human beings.
('55', 148, 1, 11, 288001) The thought of what will happen after someones death springs from foolishness, not from human attachment.
('55', 148, 1, 12, 288107) Everyone is to die sooner or later.
('55', 148, 1, 13, 288143) Knowing this, why should we worry over death?
('55', 148, 1, 14, 288189) Moreover, having surrendered ourselves as puppets in the hands of the Master, how can we bargain with Him?
('55', 148, 1, 15, 288296) He may make us dance as He wills.
('55', 148, 1, 16, 288330) After all, what matters is that we should be able to dance.
('55', 148, 1, 17, 288390) If a person can always dance, what else can he ask for?
('55', 148, 1, 18, 288446) It is very good indeed that you are making progress in your music.

('55', 148, 1, 23, 288767) I do not at all wish to tell you your defects.
('55', 148, 1, 24, 288814) Havent I pointed them out more than once?
('55', 148, 1, 25, 288856) Let me know how many of them you have overcome; we shall talk about others afterwards.
('55', 148, 1, 26, 288943) Devotees of God and such other people can cultivate equal mindedness only in a certain measure.
('55', 148, 1, 27, 289039) He in whom it becomes perfect must be God.
('55', 148, 1, 28, 289082) But, then, there is only one God.
('55', 148, 1, 29, 289116) Hence, even the most perfect human being will have equal mindedness in an imperfect measure.
('55', 148, 1, 30, 289209) That is why we see differences in peoples beliefs and conflicts among them.
('55', 148, 1, 31, 289285) We need not be unhappy about this.

('55', 149, 1, 4, 289730) If we try to do this, the presence of discord in the world will cease to hurt us and become bearable, may even seem beautiful.
('55', 149, 1, 5, 289857) We need not believe that everything in India is better than elsewhere.
('55', 149, 1, 6, 289928) Moreover, rise and fall is the law of the world.
('55', 149, 1, 7, 289977) On the whole, there is much good in India.
('55', 149, 1, 8, 290020) That is why it became a conquered country, and not a conquering country.
('55', 149, 1, 9, 290093) At the basis of this attitude is the belief that an oppressor is in a worse state than his slave.

('55', 150, 8, 14, 291560) Realizing the sense of brotherhood is the most important thing in the observance of brahmacharya.
('55', 150, 8, 15, 291658) We all are children of the same Father, how can we at all marry?
('55', 150, 8, 16, 291723) Food must be eaten only as medicine, not for pleasure of the palate.
('55', 150, 8, 17, 291792) Mind and body should be kept occupied in service.
('55', 150, 8, 18, 291842) Meditate over Satyanarayana 2. Cut off your hair regardless of peoples opinion if you feel it is your duty.
('55', 150, 8, 19, 291950) Remain ever absorbed in service as a form of devotion to God.
('55', 150, 8, 20, 292012) Keep up a constant struggle against the passions, holding them to be our real enemy.
('55', 150, 8, 21, 292097) This very struggle has been delineated in the Mahabharata.

('55', 151, 2, 3, 292370) MY DEAR AGATHA, You will recognize this hand 1. Mahadev came in just when my right hand had begun to refuse to work for me, not that there is any continuing pain but writing with it is difficult.
('55', 151, 2, 4, 292566) I do a fair amount of writing with the left hand and am using Mahadevs hand whenever I can.
('55', 151, 2, 5, 292658) You [talk] 2 of Dr. Ramchandra Rao.
('55', 151, 2, 6, 292694) I cant identify him He is not likely to be permitted to see me.

('55', 151, 5, 14, 293154) Please dont worry about my food.
('55', 151, 5, 15, 293187) I have not yet had to resume milk.
('55', 151, 5, 16, 293222) I fancy that when one is leading a quiet and contemplative life, one does not need the stimulation of milk and its vitamins.
('55', 151, 5, 17, 293347) I am keeping my weight and the required energy on a diet of bread, almond paste, green vegetable and tomatoes, and lemon.
('55', 151, 5, 18, 293469) I take also about 2 oz.
('55', 151, 5, 19, 293493) of honey daily mixed with hot water and a pinch of bicarbonate of soda.

('55', 152, 3, 9, 294274) Do you get any medical help there?
('55', 152, 3, 10, 294309) Did you go to Bhowali?
('55', 152, 3, 11, 294332) The very air of that place is as good as medicine.
('55', 152, 3, 12, 294383) How is it that you still dont improve?
('55', 152, 3, 13, 294422) I received only one letter from Sarojinidevi and replied to her.

('55', 152, 7, 19, 294836) I got the dates you sent for the second time.
('55', 152, 7, 20, 294882) They contain numerous caterpillars and weevils, which perhaps may have bred after the parcel reached here.
('55', 152, 7, 21, 294989) In any case, however, you should not send more dates until I ask for them.
('55', 152, 7, 22, 295064) The dates supplied here are not bad but, for some time, I wish to see if I cannot do without dates altogether.
('55', 152, 7, 23, 295175) It is not possible here to preserve in good condition a large stock of any eatables.
('55', 152, 7, 24, 295260) Moreover, friends outside should not spend either time or money on those in jail unless necessary.
('55', 152, 7, 25, 295359) When I need [anything] I will certainly ask [for it].

('55', 153, 2, 3, 295688) March 22, 1932
('55', 153, 3, 4, 295703) A devotee of the Gita never concerns himself with the question whether he can see God while in this body, for it is his duty to do work but he has no right to claim the fruit.
('55', 153, 3, 5, 295879) If so, why should we think about that to which we have no right?
('55', 153, 3, 6, 295944) All the same, it is my view that full realization of God is impossible while in this body.
('55', 153, 3, 7, 296035) We may almost reach the goal, but, because of the body, it seems impossible that we can go through the doorway.
('55', 153, 3, 8, 296147) We must, of course, feel continually the misery of separation from God, otherwise we would give up or relax our effort.
('55', 153, 3, 9, 296267) Such misery, however, should leadnot to despair but to hope, not to relaxation of effort but to even greater effort.
('55', 153, 3, 10, 296384) We have Gods assurance that however small the effort, it is never wasted.
('55', 153, 3, 11, 296458) In view of this, even the misery of separation should be a cause of joy to us, for we must have faith that one day we shall realize Him.

('55', 154, 9, 16, 297713) MY DEAR, In working out plans for self restraint, attention must not for a single moment be withdrawn from the fact that we are all sparks of the divine and, therefore, partake of its nature, and since there can be no such thing as self indulgence with the divine it must of necessity be foreign to human nature.
('55', 154, 9, 17, 298026) If we get a hard grasp of that elementary fact, we should have no difficulty in attaining self control, and that is exactly what is implied in the verses we sing every evening.
('55', 154, 9, 18, 298203) You will recall that one of the verses says that the craving for self indulgence abates only when one sees God face to face.

('55', 155, 8, 20, 299490) The Mahabharata is a poem and not history.
('55', 155, 8, 21, 299533) The poets aim in it is to show that, if man adopts the path of violence, he will necessarily have to resort to falsehood.
('55', 155, 8, 22, 299655) Even a person like Krishna cannot escape that necessity.

('55', 156, 1, 3, 299927) If I remember correctly, Vyasji also has represented them in that light.
('55', 156, 1, 4, 300000) If the plays which represent such incidents show that they are not worthy of imitation, there may be no harm in staging them.

('55', 159, 3, 8, 304809) You should have immediately sent to him the gist of the conversation.

('55', 159, 8, 22, 305420) Mahadev was just sent to me when I had again to fall back on the left hand.
('55', 159, 8, 23, 305496) I was glad to have your note.
('55', 159, 8, 24, 305526) Agatha has been keeping me informed to the extent that she can of your activities and the papers that I am allowed to receive do also now and then mention something of the activities of all the many friends who had interested themselves in this struggle and Hoyland has been telling me of the silent prayers.
('55', 159, 8, 25, 305835) I know that they are all precious and not one prayer of the heart is without an adequate response.
('55', 159, 8, 26, 305934) What though one does not see tangible results of all heartfelt prayers!
('55', 159, 8, 27, 306006) You are quite right in being happy for me to have this enforced rest.
('55', 159, 8, 28, 306076) If it had not come to me there would have been in all probability, a breakdown.

('55', 161, 8, 15, 307943) But I am not surprised.
('55', 161, 8, 16, 307967) Such correspondence was held up.
('55', 161, 8, 17, 308000) But the bar is now lifted at least so far as I am concerned and therefore presumably so far as my correspondents are concerned.
('55', 161, 8, 18, 308128) I therefore expect from you an answer almost per return.
('55', 161, 8, 19, 308185) Tell me how you and your companions are doing, what you are eating and how you are passing the days.
('55', 161, 8, 20, 308286) Mahadev has now joined us and we have become a merry company.
('55', 161, 8, 21, 308348) He is the most industrious spinner among us.
('55', 161, 8, 22, 308393) My weak arms wont let me try to outdo him.
('55', 161, 8, 23, 308436) My milkless diet continues without practically any change in the menu.
('55', 161, 8, 24, 308507) I think I did tell you about the addition of bread.

('55', 162, 3, 5, 308961) I therefore suspended the despatch for writing this.
('55', 162, 3, 6, 309014) You now know why I could not write, but then we are prisoners.
('55', 162, 3, 7, 309077) We may not expect the regularity that independent people can create for themselves.
('55', 162, 3, 8, 309161) But there is nothing to grumble at in these delays which must be regarded as inevitable.
('55', 162, 3, 9, 309250) Henceforth, let us hope, things will move on without interruption.
('55', 162, 3, 10, 309317) But whenever the unexpected hitch of any kind occurs, do not be anxious, but say, We are prisoners.
('55', 162, 3, 11, 309417) I am glad you have put on weight.
('55', 162, 3, 12, 309451) For your height and breadth, you can easily carry 132 lb.
('55', 162, 3, 13, 309509) But the heat is bad.
('55', 162, 3, 14, 309530) It is good to have dropped salt.
('55', 162, 3, 15, 309563) You might even drop milk and butter for two or three days and you will feel cool.
('55', 162, 3, 16, 309645) I am glad you are growing fond of reading.
('55', 162, 3, 17, 309688) Get someone to procure for you full translation of Ramayana by Griffiths and the translation of eleven principal Upanishads.
('55', 162, 3, 18, 309813) This will be enough for the present term.
('55', 162, 3, 19, 309855) For Hindi, you should procure Bala Ramayana.
('55', 162, 3, 20, 309900) As you now know the story, you will have no difficulty in following it in Hindi.
('55', 162, 3, 21, 309981) I had copy of Lord Irwins letter 2 before too.
('55', 162, 3, 22, 310028) I too have no news of Rolland.
('55', 162, 3, 23, 310059) But I do not worry.

('55', 166, 3, 4, 314186) SHANKERLAL, I received your telegram 1 this evening.
('55', 166, 3, 5, 314239) How did such an accident happen?
('55', 166, 3, 6, 314272) Were you present at the time of the operation ?
('55', 166, 3, 7, 314320) You have been placed under a great load.
('55', 166, 3, 8, 314361) But you believe in God.
('55', 166, 3, 9, 314385) There is assurance in the Gita that the load of a believer is borne by God.
('55', 166, 3, 10, 314461) Have faith in God and keep your mind free.
('55', 166, 3, 11, 314504) I shall expect your detailed letter.
('55', 166, 3, 12, 314541) Vallabhbhai and Mahadev also are terribly shocked.

('55', 166, 7, 17, 314729) March 28, 1932
('55', 166, 8, 18, 314744) John Ruskin was a great writer, teacher and religious thinker.
('55', 166, 8, 19, 314807) He died about 1880. 3 I suppose most inmates of the Ashram know that one book 4 of his had a great effect on me and that it was this book which inspired me to introduce an important change in my life practically on the instant.
('55', 166, 8, 20, 315035) He started in 1871 writing monthly letters addressed to factory workers.
('55', 166, 8, 21, 315108) I had read praise of these letters in some article of Tolstoy, but I had not been able to secure them till now.
('55', 166, 8, 22, 315220) I had brought with me [from England] a book about Ruskins workand his efforts in the field of constructive activities.
('55', 166, 8, 23, 315339) I read it here.
('55', 166, 8, 24, 315355) This book also mentioned the letters referred to above.
('55', 166, 8, 25, 315411) So I wrote to a

('55', 167, 0, 1, 315604) 168 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 167, 1, 2, 315646) woman disciple of Ruskin in England, who was none else but the author of that book.
('55', 167, 1, 3, 315730) Being a poor woman, she could not send me the volumes of these letters.
('55', 167, 1, 4, 315802) Through foolishness or false courtesy, I had not asked her to write to the Ashram for the money.
('55', 167, 1, 5, 315899) This good woman sent my letter to a friend of hers who was comparatively in better circumstances.
('55', 167, 1, 6, 315997) This friend was the editor of The spectator.
('55', 167, 1, 7, 316042) I had even met him while in England.
('55', 167, 1, 8, 316079) He sent me the four volumes in which these letters had been published.
('55', 167, 1, 9, 316150) I have been reading the first part.
('55', 167, 1, 10, 316186) The thoughts expressed in these letters are beautiful and resemble some of our own ideas, so much so that an outsider would think that the ideas which I have set forth in my writings and which we try to put into practice in the Ashram, I had stolen from these letters of Ruskin.
('55', 167, 1, 11, 316465) I hope readers will understand what is meant by stolen.
('55', 167, 1, 12, 316521) If an idea or ideal of life is borrowed from somebody but is presented as ones own conception, it is said to be stolen.
('55', 167, 1, 13, 316641) Ruskin has discussed many matters.
('55', 167, 1, 14, 316676) Here I will mention only a few of his ideas.
('55', 167, 1, 15, 316721) He says that it is a sheer error to suppose, as is generally done, that some education however little or however faulty is better than no literary education at all.
('55', 167, 1, 16, 316886) It is his view that we should strive for real education alone.
('55', 167, 1, 17, 316949) And then he says that every human being requires three things and three virtues.
('55', 167, 1, 18, 317030) Anyone who fails to cultivate them does not know the secret of life.
('55', 167, 1, 19, 317099) These six things should therefore form the basis of education.
('55', 167, 1, 20, 317162) Every child, whether boy or girl, should learn the properties of pure air, clean water and clean earth, and should also learn how to keep air, water and earth pure or clean and know their benefits.
('55', 167, 1, 21, 317360) Likewise, he has mentioned gratitude, hope and charity as the three virtues.
('55', 167, 1, 22, 317437) Anybody who does not love truth and cannot recognize goodness or beauty lives in his own selfconceit and remains ignorant of spiritual joy.
('55', 167, 1, 23, 317577) Similarly, he who has no hope, who has, in other words, no faith in divine justice, will never be cheerful in heart.
('55', 167, 1, 24, 317694) And he who is without love, that is, lacks the spirit of ahimsa, who cannot look upon all living things as his kith and kin, will never know the secret of living.
('55', 167, 1, 25, 317857) Ruskin has explained these ideas at great length in his wonderful language.
('55', 167, 1, 26, 317933) I hope I shall be able to write about them some time in a language which all the inmates of the Ashram can understand.
('55', 167, 1, 27, 318052) Today I rest content with the brief precis given above.
('55', 167, 1, 28, 318108) But I will say one thing, that what Ruskin has explained in his finished and cultivated prose with English readers in view, is practically thesame ideas which
('55', 168, 0, 1, 318267) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 169
('55', 168, 1, 2, 318313) we discuss in our rustic language and which we have been trying to put into practice.
('55', 168, 1, 3, 318399) I am comparing here not two languages, but two writers.
('55', 168, 1, 4, 318455) I cannot hope to equal Ruskins mastery of language.
('55', 168, 1, 5, 318507) But a time will certainly come when the love of our language will have become universal and we shall have writers like Ruskin who will have dedicated themselves heart and soul to it and will write as powerful Gujarati as the English of Ruskin.

('55', 168, 5, 10, 318902) Narandas kept me informed.
('55', 168, 5, 11, 318929) Now I am glad I have your letter.
('55', 168, 5, 12, 318963) It was very good of Dr. Sharma to treat you without making any charge.
('55', 168, 5, 13, 319034) You may send such books of his as he may recommend.
('55', 168, 5, 14, 319086) The question of deciding the place for you is a little difficult.
('55', 168, 5, 15, 319152) You must go to hill or to a sea side place.
('55', 168, 5, 16, 319196) I think you can go to Porbandar or Sasavne.
('55', 168, 5, 17, 319240) I cannot think of another place just now.
('55', 168, 5, 18, 319282) You must not lose your gain by any false step.
('55', 168, 5, 19, 319329) If any of your people are living in Mussoorie you need not hesitate to go there.
('55', 168, 5, 20, 319410) I agree with Narandas that you should not live at the Ashram during these hot days.
('55', 168, 5, 21, 319494) Of course you can come and see me whenever you wish.
('55', 168, 5, 22, 319547) Sardar Vallabhbhai and Mahadev are with me.
('55', 168, 5, 23, 319591) As my right hand causes a little trouble if I write with it, I have been using the left hand.

('55', 168, 7, 26, 319746) March 28, 1932
('55', 168, 8, 27, 319761) DEAR MR. EMERSON, I was distressed to read a note by the Director of Information, Bombay, that the Bombay Government intended to sell out beyond recall the lands of recalcitrant farmers of Ras and such other villages.
('55', 168, 8, 28, 319979) I do not know that you can recall the remark made by Lord
('55', 169, 0, 1, 320037) 170 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 169, 1, 2, 320079) Irwin last year, in the course of the conversations, that under a recurrence of the circumstances which had actuated the Government to sell out some holdings in Ras during the previous satyagraha campaign, the experiment must not be repeated.
('55', 169, 1, 3, 320322) I do not suggest that this remark was anything more than the then personal wish of Lord Irwin.
('55', 169, 1, 4, 320417) But I cannot help feeling hurt that all such generous wishes of an honourable and high functionary should be in danger of being set aside or overlooked.
('55', 169, 1, 5, 320570) And even apart from Lord Irwins obiter statement, I would like the legacies of bitternesses to be left either by Government officials or Congressmen to be reduced to a minimum, if they cannot be avoided altogether.
('55', 169, 1, 6, 320785) Surely all irrevocable acts which parties might possibly deplore in future or for which posterity may curse us should be avoided.

('55', 169, 6, 13, 321075) Vanity is emptiness: Self respect is substance.
('55', 169, 6, 14, 321123) No ones self respect is ever hurt except by self, vanity is always hurt from outside.
('55', 169, 6, 15, 321209) In the phrase Seeing God face to face, face to face is not to be taken literally.
('55', 169, 6, 16, 321291) It is a matter of decided feeling.
('55', 169, 6, 17, 321326) God is formless.
('55', 169, 6, 18, 321343) He can, therefore, only be seen by spiritual sightvision.

('55', 169, 10, 22, 321462) BHAI, In order to strengthen your mind, you should firmly adhere to the resolutions for the day which you make every morning.
('55', 169, 10, 23, 321588) After some time, you can make resolutions for a week and so gradually for your whole life.
('55', 169, 10, 24, 321679) You should not let a single worthless thought arise in your mind.
('55', 169, 10, 25, 321745) This is the reason for the great importance of Ramanama.
('55', 169, 10, 26, 321802) It is a tamboora, and other good thoughts are like the other

('55', 170, 1, 3, 321940) The tune on the tamboora must go on ceaselessly.
('55', 170, 1, 4, 321989) For good health, freedom from worry is essential.
('55', 170, 1, 5, 322039) In your case, I am sure that your health will improve if your mental illness is cured.

('55', 171, 1, 4, 323656) I attach no importance to dreams.

('55', 171, 1, 7, 323815) How many copies of the consolidated list of books do we have?
('55', 171, 1, 8, 323877) If we have more than one copy send one to me.
('55', 171, 1, 9, 323923) I have never written to you about the grown up women.
('55', 171, 1, 10, 323977) I feel inclined to do so this time.
('55', 171, 1, 11, 324013) They do not seem to come together for any common purpose.
('55', 171, 1, 12, 324071) That is, their Association has broken up.
('55', 171, 1, 13, 324113) I have written to Lakshmibehn and Durga on this matter, but I seem to have produced no effect on them.
('55', 171, 1, 14, 324216) The women should get the strength to assume responsibility for joint work.
('55', 171, 1, 15, 324291) If you have sufficient courage and confidence in yourself, take up this task.
('55', 171, 1, 16, 324369) If you do so, however, you must resolve not to be defeated.
('55', 171, 1, 17, 324429) We have, in fact, achieved nothing if we are able to do something when all the circumstances are favourable.

('55', 171, 1, 20, 324801) For that, our heart should be as large as the sea.
('55', 171, 1, 21, 324852) If we observe the defects of a person the very moment we see him or her and are deterred by them, our work would suffer.
('55', 171, 1, 22, 324973) Everyone has defects.
('55', 171, 1, 23, 324995) We have them and so have others.

('55', 171, 1, 25, 325125) I know thatthis is a difficult task.
('55', 171, 1, 26, 325162) I have been engaged in this one task all these years and yet I cannot say that I have succeeded in it.

('55', 173, 8, 14, 327345) As the leaves of a tree always live together, so do men with similar ideas and ways.
('55', 173, 8, 15, 327430) Their attraction for one another is natural.The number of ones co workers may be a million, but there can be only one friend, and that is God.
('55', 173, 8, 16, 327573) It is my view, and my experience, that other friendships are an obstacle in the way of friendship with God.
('55', 173, 8, 17, 327681) I do not know, and do not believe, that Lord Krishna could go from one place to another, without any physical means, through yogic power or some other power.
('55', 173, 8, 18, 327839) A real yogi shuns the exercise of any supernatural power, for his yoga is exclusively for self realization.

('55', 174, 2, 3, 328116) March 24/29, 1932
('55', 174, 3, 4, 328134) NARANDAS,
('55', 174, 4, 5, 328144) I got your packet yesterday.
('55', 174, 4, 6, 328173) Gangabehn came and saw me.
('55', 174, 4, 7, 328200) It is necessary that we should think about Indus health.
('55', 174, 4, 8, 328257) When he returned from Bangalore, he weighed 100 lb., and he is 90 now.
('55', 174, 4, 9, 328328) Discover the cause.
('55', 174, 4, 10, 328348) Know from him where and what he eats, what he used to eat in Bangalore and what was his way of life there, and how, according to him, he can keep better health in the Ashram.
('55', 174, 4, 11, 328523) If anybody does not keep good health in the Ashram, we should try and discover the cause and, if he or she does not improve with such measures and changes as we can try and as would be in keeping with the principles of the Ashram, we should send the person to some other place, to Visapur or Wardha, for instance.
('55', 174, 4, 12, 328837) Think over this problem and, if you consider it necessary, entrust the responsibility in this matter to one particular person.
('55', 174, 4, 13, 328964) You will not be able to look after every inmate of the Ashram.
('55', 174, 4, 14, 329027) You should be burdened only with the responsibility of giving the final decision.
('55', 174, 5, 15, 329109) I take it that you got the letter 1 which I wrote last week and in which I explained about visitors, and I do not dwell further on the subject in this letter.
('55', 174, 5, 16, 329268) I also wrote about Champa in that letter.
('55', 174, 5, 17, 329310) There were two or three other points too.
('55', 174, 6, 18, 329352) Indu has raised a very good question in his letter.
('55', 174, 6, 19, 329404) Read my reply 2 to him.
('55', 174, 6, 20, 329428) However, you, Panditji, Premabehn, Chimanlal, Valji and others in the Ashram who think on such matters should ponder over the problem.
('55', 174, 6, 21, 329563) Indu had asked whether Krishna did not do wrong in advising Arjuna to keep Shikhandi in front of him and kill Bhishma and in employing his Sudarshan wheel to hide the sun behind clouds, so that Jayadrath might be killed, and had raised the question whether plays which treated of such incidents should be performed in the Ashram.
('55', 174, 6, 22, 329893) I was very much pleased by his question.
('55', 174, 6, 23, 329934) If the general tendency of the drama is to show such actions as morally

('55', 175, 1, 2, 330133) wrong, I would have no objection to its being performed.
('55', 175, 1, 3, 330190) All the same, I do have some doubt about the propriety of such dramas being performed in the Ashram.
('55', 175, 1, 4, 330291) I dont think we do any good by repeatedly presenting to children unworthy actions of great men, even though we represent the actions as unworthy, unless it is absolutely necessary to tell them about such actions.
('55', 175, 1, 5, 330504) They will probably forget the unworthiness of the action and leave with the impression that we, too, could do what great men did.
('55', 175, 1, 6, 330634) It does not, therefore, seem proper to me to select such incidents and present them in dramatic performances before children.
('55', 175, 1, 7, 330760) I think that the dramas which we perform in the Ashram should be of a different type.
('55', 175, 1, 8, 330846) For instance, Rabindranaths Muktadhara.
('55', 175, 1, 9, 330886) Maithilisharan Guptas Anagh, which I recently read here, is also a good play and could be performed before the children there.
('55', 175, 1, 10, 331013) Its Hindi is simple and sweet and the moral is excellent.
('55', 175, 2, 11, 331071) I go and inquire after Haridas from time to time.
('55', 175, 3, 12, 331121) Do you get news about Krishnadas 1 from any source?
('55', 175, 3, 13, 331173) If you do not, write to Mahavir Prasad and ask him if he has any.
('55', 175, 4, 14, 331239) Amtulbehn may certainly come and see me.
('55', 175, 4, 15, 331280) Your scabies and Kanus ought to be cured now.
('55', 175, 5, 16, 331326) About the Vidyapith library, so far as we can judge from this distance, all of us feel that we should not introduce the kindof dyarchy which has been suggested.
('55', 175, 5, 17, 331487) It would mean control by two authorities.
('55', 175, 5, 18, 331529) Either they should hand over full control to us or should themselves exercise it properly as long as they retain it with them.
('55', 175, 5, 19, 331656) However, do only what seems best to you.
('55', 175, 5, 20, 331697) I shall not be able to see the women prisoners lodged in this jail, but I shall be permitted to write to them and receive letters from them.
('55', 175, 6, 21, 331838) Anandi had referred to Prema in her letter.
('55', 175, 6, 22, 331882) Read my reply 2 to her.
('55', 175, 6, 23, 331906) The matter requires further thought, however.
('55', 175, 6, 24, 331952) In teaching the children in the Ashram to be fearless and to stand erect, we have, unknowingly, taught them rudeness.
('55', 175, 6, 25, 332070) Even grown ups are not free from such rudeness and, sometimes, their rudeness assumes a painful

('55', 176, 0, 1, 332259) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 177
('55', 176, 1, 2, 332305) It seems that a guest had arrived in the Ashram and the boys did not answer his inquiries properly.
('55', 176, 1, 3, 332405) One directed him this way and another that way, and none would even reply to his questions.
('55', 176, 1, 4, 332497) And of course none took the trouble to accompany him to the office.
('55', 176, 1, 5, 332565) I understand from Anandis letter that she was somewhere near about but she felt unhappy afterwards and wrote to me about the incident, it seems, to confess her error and atone for it.
('55', 176, 1, 6, 332749) She has asked me about the duty of the inmates of the Ashram in such circumstances.
('55', 176, 1, 7, 332833) There is no doubt about what it is, but since the question has been raised you should draw everybodys attention to it.
('55', 176, 1, 8, 332952) Explain what I have written to Anandi, filling in the necessary details.
('55', 176, 1, 9, 333025) In my letter I could write only a sentence or two explaining the general principle.
('55', 176, 1, 10, 333109) Vanamala tells me in her letter that Mohans body temperature always remains 99.
('55', 176, 1, 11, 333189) Inquire about this.
('55', 176, 1, 12, 333209) If necessary, consult a doctor.
('55', 176, 1, 13, 333241) Why should a child of his age continually show 99 temperature?
('55', 176, 1, 14, 333304) Or, maybe, just because he is a child, on taking his temperature with a thermometer or examining his pulse, we may feel that he is having fever but in fact there may be no fever.
('55', 176, 1, 15, 333483) The heart beat of a very active child who is playing about the whole day is bound to be faster, and, therefore, he is bound to have more heat in him and the thermometer or the examination of his pulse may show a little fever.
('55', 176, 1, 16, 333709) In such a case, the real test is provided by the childs stool, the appearance of his tongue, his digestion and his weight.
('55', 176, 1, 17, 333832) A childs weight must show increase every weak.
('55', 176, 1, 18, 333879) His tongue should be clean and moist, he should be passing stool without effort and it must be well formed and without foul smell.
('55', 176, 1, 19, 334010) If all these signs are there, we need not pay any attention to what the pulse or the thermometer may tell us.
('55', 176, 1, 20, 334120) Every mother in the Ashram, and Jethalal too, should learn these things.
('55', 176, 1, 21, 334193) There was a letter from Amtul to which, as desired by her, I have replied at her Delhi address.
('55', 176, 1, 22, 334289) Tell her this if she has arrived there.
('55', 176, 1, 23, 334329) She may certainly come and see me.
('55', 176, 1, 24, 334364) I agree with you that it would be better for her not to live at Sabarmati in summer.
('55', 176, 1, 25, 334449) It would be very good if you can arrange for her to stay in Porbandar, Chorwad or Sasavne.
('55', 176, 1, 26, 334540) If she has relations in Mussoorie, she may go there.
('55', 176, 1, 27, 334593) It would also do her good if she can stay with Padma in Almora.
('55', 176, 1, 28, 334657) I have given this advice in my letter to her also.
('55', 176, 1, 29, 334708) Do help to accommodate her, if you can, as I have suggested.
('55', 176, 1, 30, 334769) On taking your letter in my hand, I read Pyare Alis name in it.
('55', 177, 0, 1, 334833) 178 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 177, 1, 2, 334875) At the place where he lives the air may be cool, and so Amtul will perhaps feel happy there and may also be able to help Pyare Ali.
('55', 177, 1, 3, 335007) Sultana 1 and other children are there, too.
('55', 177, 1, 4, 335052) However, treat all this as no more than suggestions.
('55', 177, 1, 5, 335105) Do what you think proper.
('55', 177, 1, 6, 335131) I and Gangabehn have started writing to each other.
('55', 177, 1, 7, 335183) She informs me that all the women prisoners are keeping well.
('55', 177, 1, 8, 335245) I got the leather sent by you for repairing sandal soles.
('55', 177, 1, 9, 335303) My experiment of milkless diet is continuing.
('55', 177, 1, 10, 335349) It has proceeded all right so far.
('55', 177, 1, 11, 335384) I deduce from this fact that for a person leading a quiet life milk is perhaps not necessary.
('55', 177, 1, 12, 335478) From the point of view of spiritual well being, it may even be harmful.
('55', 177, 1, 13, 335550) As yet, this is only an inference.
('55', 177, 1, 14, 335585) I can be positive only if the experiment continues successfully for a long time.
('55', 177, 1, 15, 335666) In my own case this is certainly true, that before I was attacked by dysentery in 1918 I could do without milk no matter how hard I was working.
('55', 177, 1, 16, 335811) However, these speculations serve no purpose just now.
('55', 177, 1, 17, 335866) All that is necessary is that I should let you know about the effects of the experiment from week to week.
('55', 177, 1, 18, 335973) For the present, let nobody even think of following my example.

('55', 178, 2, 3, 336357) March 29, 1932
('55', 178, 3, 4, 336372) DEAR BOYS AND GIRLS, As there was no letter from you this week, there was no need for me to write to you.
('55', 178, 3, 5, 336478) But this time I ignore the omission.
('55', 178, 3, 6, 336515) Knowledge should be given only to a jijnasu.
('55', 178, 3, 7, 336560) A jijnasu means a person who hungers for knowledge.
('55', 178, 3, 8, 336612) As a child fed by its mother even when it is not hungry will fall ill, so also, if you are not hungry for knowledge you will not be able to digest knowledge which is forced on you, that is, you will derive no benefit from it.
('55', 178, 3, 9, 336838) Hence, not only should I get a letter from you every week, but the letter should also be an interesting one.
('55', 178, 3, 10, 336947) Interesting means sweet, one which gave you pleasure in writing and will give me pleasure in reading.
('55', 178, 3, 11, 337049) If you are interested in lejim exercises, you may write an interesting letter on that subject but it may not be interesting to me because I may know nothing about these exercises and have no means here of knowing anything.
('55', 178, 3, 12, 337272) If you write such a letter, what can I write in reply?
('55', 178, 3, 13, 337327) Do you understand now the two conditions your letters must fulfil so that they may be interesting?
('55', 178, 3, 14, 337426) I, too, must fulfil those conditions in my letters.
('55', 178, 3, 15, 337478) That is why I once wrote to Sharda that, if you could take no interest in my letters about the Gita, the fault must be mine.
('55', 178, 3, 16, 337603) So be it.

('55', 180, 10, 16, 340081) March 31, 1932
('55', 180, 11, 17, 340096) KUSUM (SENIOR), Since you have taken a pledge that you will write, you should do so regularly.
('55', 180, 11, 18, 340191) That you have completed twenty four years means nothing at all.
('55', 180, 11, 19, 340255) You have a long span of life before you yet and should fulfil during it the hopes which I may have built on you.
('55', 180, 11, 20, 340368) Do go and visit Pyarelal.
('55', 180, 11, 21, 340394) Personally I think I am keeping very good health this time.
('55', 180, 11, 22, 340454) That I have been able to maintain my weight without milk and do not require enemas is enough for me.
('55', 180, 11, 23, 340555) I dont mind very much if I cannot write with the right hand.
('55', 180, 11, 24, 340616) I shall get used to writing with the left hand.
('55', 180, 11, 25, 340664) All three of us are doing well.

('55', 181, 3, 4, 340848) MOHAN, The letters you make vary in size.
('55', 181, 3, 5, 340890) Improve your hand.
('55', 181, 3, 6, 340909) It is a good thing that you rise early.
('55', 181, 3, 7, 340949) Do you know the tables?
('55', 181, 3, 8, 340973) If you do not, learn them.

('55', 181, 7, 11, 341079) March 31, 1932
('55', 181, 8, 12, 341094) As I had no news from you at all, at last I wrote to Taramati.
('55', 181, 8, 13, 341157) Then unexpectedly I got your letter yesterday and felt happy.
('55', 181, 8, 14, 341219) I do not worry about your loss of weight.
('55', 181, 8, 15, 341261) Your health should remain good in other respects.
('55', 181, 8, 16, 341311) From the point of view of climate, Nasik is excellent.
('55', 181, 8, 17, 341366) Write to me regularly from wherever you may be.
('55', 181, 8, 18, 341414) If writing to me comes in the way of your writing to others, ask one of those to whom you must write to convey your message to me.
('55', 181, 8, 19, 341545) The understanding between the authorities here and me is that I can write to any of my fellow prisoners.
('55', 181, 8, 20, 341650) This should mean that, if the prisoner chooses to reply to me, his letter should not count among the number he is entitled to write.
('55', 181, 8, 21, 341783) 1 A prisoner ought not to even think of the outside world.
('55', 181, 8, 22, 341842) Karmayoga for him would mean doing the duty which now has become his in jail.
('55', 181, 8, 23, 341920) In the verse cq_kS 'kj.kefUoPN 2; seek refuge in the attitude of detachment, etc., the word buddhi certainly does not mean the samkhya, or the path of knowledge.
('55', 181, 8, 24, 342082) Here it has the meaning which it bears in the phrase yogabuddhi, about which the Lord had promised to explain in the verse ,"kk rsfHkfgrk lka[;s cqf_;ksxsfRoeka J`.kqA3 Thus have I set before thee the attitude of Knowledge; hear now the attitude of Action, etc.
('55', 181, 8, 25, 342344) That is to say, if any comparison is to

('55', 182, 1, 2, 342489) be made at all, it is between karmayoga and bhaktiyoga.
('55', 182, 1, 3, 342545) But instead of making a comparison between jnanayoga, karmayoga and bhaktiyoga, the Gita aims at a synthesis of the three.
('55', 182, 1, 4, 342668) To practise any one of them perfectly, one must also practise the other two.
('55', 182, 1, 5, 342745) That is, the three are inseparable.
('55', 182, 1, 6, 342781) There is some indication of the superiority of karmayoga from among the three, but only because there is less risk in it of being deceived.
('55', 182, 1, 7, 342921) usgkfHkeuk'kksfLr izR;ok;ks u fo|rs1 Here no effort undertaken is lost, no disaster befalls, etc.
('55', 182, 1, 8, 343019) I believe that we must first grasp the general purport of the book we are trying to study.
('55', 182, 1, 9, 343110) In other words, our thinking about it should be independent.
('55', 182, 1, 10, 343171) As for rebirth, there is no room for doubt at all.
('55', 182, 1, 11, 343222) Our body changes a little every day, so that in seven years the whole gets changed altogether.
('55', 182, 1, 12, 343317) It seems to be the same because the form remains the same.
('55', 182, 1, 13, 343376) If the body can be transformed every seven years, there is no reason whatever to think that what we know as death means complete annihilation.
('55', 182, 1, 14, 343519) The atman is different from the body and it is certainly not destroyed when the body is destroyed.
('55', 182, 1, 15, 343618) Then, all that takes place at death is a change of state.
('55', 182, 1, 16, 343676) If a change of state is possible, why not a change of the body?
('55', 182, 1, 17, 343740) However, we can have a full discussion of this subject only when we meet.
('55', 182, 1, 18, 343814) Meanwhile, I certainly wish that you should be able to get rid of your doubts about certain conclusions.
('55', 182, 1, 19, 343919) For this purpose, you may put me any questions that you wish.
('55', 182, 1, 20, 343981) I dont think that I can write a smriti.
('55', 182, 1, 21, 344021) What I write or say has not been thought out in conformity with a system.
('55', 182, 1, 22, 344095) I have only enough strength to enable me to meet every situation as it arises in the course of my quest for truth.
('55', 182, 1, 23, 344210) That is to say, I am no Shastri, and only a person learned enough to write a Shastra can compose a smriti.
('55', 182, 1, 24, 344317) This suggestion was first made to me by Kishorelal.
('55', 182, 1, 25, 344369) I would certainly write such a treatise if I could.
('55', 182, 1, 26, 344421) I would be fortunate, however, if I can use rightly whatever powers God has given me.
('55', 182, 1, 27, 344507) We three are quite well.
('55', 182, 1, 28, 344532) The third is Mahadev.
('55', 182, 1, 29, 344554) [PS.] I see nothing wrong in your trying without concern for the result to come to see me.
('55', 182, 1, 30, 344645) I would be very happy if you succeed.

('55', 183, 3, 5, 344896) The best subject of study for girls is how to live a pure life.
('55', 183, 3, 6, 344960) As for other subjects, each may learn the subject in which she has interest.
('55', 183, 3, 7, 345037) Persons of the same age are not necessarily similar in nature.
('55', 183, 3, 8, 345100) The leaves of all plants do not show as if they felt shy in our presence.
('55', 183, 3, 9, 345174) I do not know why some of them do.
('55', 183, 3, 10, 345209) If any of the girls among you has an aptitude for research, let her discover the reason.

('55', 183, 8, 16, 345509) The thing which is seen settling down in urine is the natural salt.
('55', 183, 8, 17, 345577) Everyone has some of it more or less.
('55', 183, 8, 18, 345615) It is good if a new entrant is medically examined.
('55', 183, 8, 19, 345666) The question remains whether we can cope with it or no.
('55', 183, 8, 20, 345722) Neem stick, like babul stick, gives good service.

('55', 184, 3, 4, 346138) PANDITJI, Sardar is in excellent health, though he has lost some weight.
('55', 184, 3, 5, 346211) True, he had made a few changes in his food, but now he has practically returned to his normal diet.
('55', 184, 3, 6, 346312) From the authorities there was no objection at all to his doing so.
('55', 184, 3, 7, 346380) In the matter of food, the only restriction is what we lay down for ourselves.
('55', 184, 3, 8, 346459) The golden rule to follow in interpreting the Shastras is this: The various interpretations offered by the commentators may all be correct from their respective standpoints.
('55', 184, 3, 9, 346633) The seeker should faithfully adhere to the meaning that appeals to his heart and act accordingly.
('55', 184, 3, 10, 346731) It is for the Shastri to harmonize the different interpretations or to construct a system, and so on.
('55', 184, 3, 11, 346833) For the person wishing to construct a way of life for himself, there is only one harmony to be achieved between the meaning accepted by him and his daily life.

('55', 184, 8, 18, 347267) You must not let your weight increase.
('55', 184, 8, 19, 347306) Fast for a few days or live only on fruit.
('55', 184, 8, 20, 347349) All this weight is superfluous.

('55', 185, 3, 5, 347684) It will not be swaraj then.
('55', 185, 3, 6, 347712) In swaraj, people who are known for their wisdom will rule.
('55', 185, 3, 7, 347772) What they decide will be done.
('55', 185, 3, 8, 347803) Let us hope voters will count for less than they do today.
('55', 185, 4, 9, 347862) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] Mahadev is quite well.
('55', 185, 4, 10, 347911) The pain in his leg is much less.

('55', 185, 8, 17, 348388) I used to pray [as a child] because the elders in the family did.

('55', 186, 7, 14, 349175) You should know the names and properties of all the trees and varieties of grass which you grow there.
('55', 186, 7, 15, 349278) You should know where the Chandrabhaga 1 has its source.
('55', 186, 7, 16, 349335) You should also know the names of the insects, birds and other animals which you see there, and give names to such of them as have no names.
('55', 186, 7, 17, 349476) You should know the good and the bad points of the soil there, and also the history of the buildings in the neighbourhood.
('55', 186, 7, 18, 349599) Is not this enough?
('55', 186, 7, 19, 349619) How much of all this do you know?
('55', 186, 7, 20, 349653) Our capacity for observation can be increased by forming the habit of carefully examining things.
('55', 186, 7, 21, 349751) I learn to study the firmament with the help of a book.

('55', 187, 2, 3, 350110) April 3, 1932
('55', 187, 3, 4, 350124) NARANDAS, Generally I get your letters on Wednesday immediately on arrival.
('55', 187, 3, 5, 350200) This time, too, I have received a beautiful question from Indu: Can we practise sword and dagger exercises in the Ashram? 1 I dont know or remember when swords and daggers were introduced in the Ashram.
('55', 187, 3, 6, 350403) Nor do I remember whether, if they were introduced when I was there, I had been consulted.
('55', 187, 3, 7, 350494) Whether or not I was, I now think that these things have no place in the Ashram.
('55', 187, 3, 8, 350575) All of you should sit together and think over this matter and, if you feel that their introduction cannot be defended in any way, get rid of them immediately.
('55', 187, 3, 9, 350734) It seems to me that keeping lathis is the utmost limit to which we can go.
('55', 187, 3, 10, 350809) However, you and other responsible inmates of the Ashram should think independently over this matter and discuss it among yourselves.
('55', 187, 3, 11, 350943) If there are any other issues besides this, small or big, you should think over them too.
('55', 187, 3, 12, 351033) The other problem is about illness.
('55', 187, 3, 13, 351069) Anybody who falls ill, as Indu did, as soon as he or she comes to live in the Ashram, should be sent away to some other place.
('55', 187, 3, 14, 351196) For instance, Jamna 2 has returned there after gaining 12 lb.
('55', 187, 3, 15, 351258) of weight.
('55', 187, 3, 16, 351269) If she were to lose it all now, I would certainly feel very unhappy.
('55', 187, 3, 17, 351338) If a person keeps better health at some other place than he does in the Ashram, it would be good both for him and for the Ashram to send him to stay at that place.
('55', 187, 3, 18, 351502) We should try and discover the deficiencies of the Ashram because of which some persons do not keep good health there.
('55', 187, 3, 19, 351621) The water there is of course one cause, but there may be other factors too.
('55', 187, 3, 20, 351697) These are air and food.
('55', 187, 3, 21, 351721) We should find out if we are polluting the air in any way.
('55', 187, 3, 22, 351780) For this, we should examine whether the arrangements for the disposal of night soil and the excreta of cattle are satisfactory.
('55', 187, 3, 23, 351908) If Anandi is always ill, she should be sent somewhere.
('55', 187, 3, 24, 351963) Sharda told me that if I did not object, Velanbehn would send Anandi to live with her at Matheran.
('55', 187, 3, 25, 352062) Really speaking, my permission is not required at all.
('55', 187, 3, 26, 352117) It is for you to decide whether or not she should be permitted to go.
('55', 187, 3, 27, 352187) Personally, I see no objection to the suggestion.

('55', 188, 1, 2, 352516) sent to live with Sharda, that should certainly be done.
('55', 188, 1, 3, 352573) This solves the problem about only one of them.
('55', 188, 1, 4, 352621) I have asked you to think about the problem of all who keep bad health in the Ashram.
('55', 188, 1, 5, 352707) Tell Valji that I have carefully preserved the translation of Vratavichar 1 and that, if possible, I will even return it.
('55', 188, 1, 6, 352829) I feel now that I shall be able to do so.
('55', 188, 1, 7, 352871) I understand what you say about Champa.
('55', 188, 1, 8, 352911) Please remember that it is your responsibility to look after her.
('55', 188, 1, 9, 352977) You must have inferred from what I wrote above about Anandi that Harjivan 2 and Sharda 3 came and saw me.
('55', 188, 1, 10, 353083) If you canascertain how Lakshmi, Lilavati and others are doing, please write to me about them.
('55', 188, 1, 11, 353178) I got the leather for repairing the soles and the books.
('55', 188, 1, 12, 353235) The difficulty which the officials feel in permitting me to see the women prisoners lodged here is that they would have to be brought to the mens jail.
('55', 188, 1, 13, 353387) And I cannot certainly be taken to the womens jail.
('55', 188, 1, 14, 353439) Since this difficulty appeared genuine to me, I did not insist.
('55', 188, 1, 15, 353503) It was agreed, therefore, that we should be permitted to correspond.
('55', 188, 1, 16, 353572) I have already started writing.
('55', 188, 1, 17, 353604) Gangabehn informs me that all are well in the Ashram.
('55', 188, 1, 18, 353658) Continue the treatment till your scabies disappears completely.
('55', 188, 1, 19, 353722) It will benefit you in other ways too.
('55', 188, 1, 20, 353761) Is the Ashram bulletin being issued?
('55', 188, 1, 21, 353798) If it is, is a copy sent to me every time?
('55', 188, 1, 22, 353841) I have not seen any along with your letters for some weeks past.
('55', 188, 2, 23, 353906) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] I got today Prabhavatis letter.
('55', 188, 2, 24, 353964) She is in the Lucknow Central Jail.
('55', 188, 2, 25, 354000) Kanta also is there.
('55', 188, 2, 26, 354021) She has been promoted to A class.
('55', 188, 2, 27, 354055) Prabhavati has been demoted to B.
('55', 188, 2, 28, 354089) According to me Prabhavati has been promoted and Kanta demoted.
('55', 188, 2, 29, 354153) Prabhavati seems to be keeping good health.
('55', 188, 2, 30, 354197) She tells me that Jayaprakash is in Bombay.
('55', 188, 2, 31, 354241) For this week, Mahadev has sketched a fine word picture 4 which I send with this letter.

('55', 189, 2, 3, 354719) April 3, 1932
('55', 189, 3, 4, 354733) PREMA, I got your letter.
('55', 189, 3, 5, 354759) Indu has put me some fine questions.
('55', 189, 3, 6, 354796) Why should we do in the Ashram exercises with swords, jamaiya 1, etc.?
('55', 189, 3, 7, 354867) I have discussed this question in my letter 2 to Narandas.
('55', 189, 3, 8, 354926) Hence I do not say any thing about it here.
('55', 189, 3, 9, 354970) I have mentioned the question only to ask you whether it has also occurred to you, since you have been yourself learning these exercises.
('55', 189, 3, 10, 355108) I would not give to the Ashram the certificate which you do.
('55', 189, 3, 11, 355169) I would certainly be happy if it really deserved such a certificate.
('55', 189, 3, 12, 355238) You may have formed the impression that any person in the Ashram who takes up some work becomes wholly absorbed in it, but your impression is not correct.
('55', 189, 3, 13, 355393) Are we able to observe the Ashram vows faithfully?
('55', 189, 3, 14, 355444) It had been decided to teach Hindi, Urdu, Tamil, Telugu and Sanskrit in the Ashram, but we made only a half hearted effort.
('55', 189, 3, 15, 355568) Have we acquired proficiency in tanning?
('55', 189, 3, 16, 355609) Do we spin fine yarn of the highest count?
('55', 189, 3, 17, 355652) I can point to many such deficiencies, but what I have said is enough to justify my questioning [your certificate].
('55', 189, 3, 18, 355768) Everyone can pay single minded attention to lathi exercises.
('55', 189, 3, 19, 355829) But we can say likewise that everyone runs after sweets.
('55', 189, 3, 20, 355886) There are indeed many things in the world the pursuit of which requires no strenuous effort.
('55', 189, 3, 21, 355979) Since we are also animals in our nature, this quality [of pursuing a thing with single minded attention] is instinctive in us.
('55', 189, 3, 22, 356106) It does not have to be cultivated.
('55', 189, 3, 23, 356141) The question is whether or not [in a particular case] it deserves to be cultivated.
('55', 189, 3, 24, 356225) Every property of animal nature need not of course be regarded as something to be shunned.
('55', 189, 3, 25, 356316) How many persons take meals in the common kitchen these days?
('55', 189, 3, 26, 356378) Do you still make bread in the Ashram?
('55', 189, 3, 27, 356417) If yes, who is in charge of the work?
('55', 189, 3, 28, 356455) If you make good bread, send a loaf or two with any person who may come to see me.
('55', 189, 3, 29, 356538) If anyone from the Ashram meets Lakshmi, he or she should tell her that I do not remember not having replied to any letter from her.

('55', 190, 1, 2, 356753) She should, therefore, write to me.
('55', 190, 1, 3, 356789) Dikshits Jyotishshastra 1 has been translated into Gujarati.
('55', 190, 1, 4, 356850) I have got a copy of the translation with me.
('55', 190, 1, 5, 356896) Balls work will be available to me here, and so I dont want you to send a copy from there.
('55', 190, 1, 6, 356987) The books sent by Upton Sinclair belong to the Ashram.
('55', 190, 1, 7, 357042) Enter them in the catalogue and send me Boston and Brass Tacks.
('55', 190, 1, 8, 357106) Send a list of the rest.
('55', 190, 1, 9, 357131) I like the Upanishads.
('55', 190, 1, 10, 357154) But I dont consider myself fit to write a commentary on them.
('55', 190, 1, 11, 357216) You should know my love of jesting.
('55', 190, 1, 12, 357252) I can tell you only in jest that you ask me to describe your faults so that I may praise you 2. There is, of course, this truth in my remark, that if a person asks another who loves him or her to criticize him or her, he or she will hear only praise, for love covers defects as with a veil, or sees them as virtues.
('55', 190, 1, 13, 357568) It is the nature of love that it prompts one to point out on occasion the defects of the beloved one because one wants to see perfection in the person whom one loves.
('55', 190, 1, 14, 357735) Did Kisan tell you that I was praising you even when I described you as hysterical before Dhurandhar?
('55', 190, 1, 15, 357837) For, in that context you would have had to be held guilty of a more serious offence if I did not believe that you were hysterical.
('55', 190, 1, 16, 357968) You certainly are hysterical.
('55', 190, 1, 17, 357998) Sometimes you almost become mad; what does that signify?
('55', 190, 1, 18, 358055) Anyone who gives way to an emotional outburst is hysterical.
('55', 190, 1, 19, 358116) Do you understand what I mean?
('55', 190, 1, 20, 358147) I have always felt that Japans policy is regrettable.
('55', 190, 1, 21, 358201) She certainly deserved the victory over Russia but that does not make her policy worthy of emulation by others.
('55', 190, 1, 22, 358313) Just now, however, it will be enough if we take care of our own policy.
('55', 190, 1, 23, 358385) There is the Holy Being eternally awake with a million eyes to watch Japans policy.

('55', 191, 1, 2, 358695) 224. LETTER TO ASHRAM WOMEN Sunday, April 3, [1932] 1
('55', 191, 2, 3, 358749) DEAR SISTERS, Since I cannot write with the left hand as fast as I can with the right, I dictate this letter instead of writing it.
('55', 191, 2, 4, 358881) Whatever women do, how can you, being their elder, employ satyagraha against them? There is a big flaw in this argument and it is based on a misunderstanding of the nature of satyagraha.
('55', 191, 2, 5, 359068) In that question, you equate satyagraha with duragraha 2. Satyagraha makes no distinction between the young and the old, the prince and the pauper.
('55', 191, 2, 6, 359216) God also employs satyagraha against us.
('55', 191, 2, 7, 359256) His satyagraha is unceasing.
('55', 191, 2, 8, 359285) In essence, satyagraha means simply thisscrupulous regard for truth.
('55', 191, 2, 9, 359354) If God did not adhere to truth, the whole world would perish in an instant.
('55', 191, 2, 10, 359430) The point is that offering satyagraha is as much a duty as it is a privilege.
('55', 191, 2, 11, 359508) But I shall now take your own instance.
('55', 191, 2, 12, 359548) If you do not discuss my letters among yourselves and reply to them, I really need not write to you every week.
('55', 191, 2, 13, 359660) Even if I write, my letters will have no value and no effect.
('55', 191, 2, 14, 359722) A lover of truth never writes or speaks merely for the sake of writing or speaking.
('55', 191, 2, 15, 359806) There must be some definite purpose in his writing or speaking.
('55', 191, 2, 16, 359870) Ordinarily he should observe complete silence.
('55', 191, 2, 17, 359917) Really speaking, there can be nothing for me to tell you or anybody else, particularly while I am in prison.
('55', 191, 2, 18, 360026) Though I am imprisoned, the Government permits me to maintain limited contact with the outside world, and I avail myself of that freedom.
('55', 191, 2, 19, 360164) But I should do so only for writing letters with a definite aim.
('55', 191, 2, 20, 360229) A person like me should teach what he wishes to teach only through his own conduct.
('55', 191, 2, 21, 360313) Those who do not learn from my actions, how can they learn from my words?
('55', 191, 2, 22, 360387) This is the general rule.
('55', 191, 2, 23, 360413) But there are persons in the Ashram as also outside it who regard my manner of life as worth following and, for that very reason, want me to explain my ideas more clearly.
('55', 191, 2, 24, 360585) It is my duty to write to them.
('55', 191, 2, 25, 360617) You are included among these persons, but only if you ask me some questions.
('55', 191, 2, 26, 360694) That is why I told you that, if you do not reply to me, ask me no question or discuss nothing with me, why should I write to you?
('55', 191, 3, 27, 360824) 1 A part of this letter is given in Mahadevbhaini Diary, Guide to London, under the date April 4, 1932. 2 Opposite of satyagraha
('55', 192, 0, 1, 360953) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 193
('55', 192, 1, 2, 360999) I know that you feel shy.
('55', 192, 1, 3, 361025) I also know your nature.
('55', 192, 1, 4, 361050) You do what service you can and say nothing.
('55', 192, 1, 5, 361095) That is perfectly right, and it befits you.
('55', 192, 1, 6, 361139) But even though we should learn to live in that manner, after all we have to mix with one another.
('55', 192, 1, 7, 361238) Living in the Ashram means that we should live as a small community, that is, live together, have our meals together, work and spend our free time together and think together.
('55', 192, 1, 8, 361414) This is the meaning of the mantra which we recite before commencing every meal.
('55', 192, 1, 9, 361494) Animals also have some capacity for living and moving together.
('55', 192, 1, 10, 361558) But man has it in unlimited measure, and it must be so because it is his dharma to realize his oneness with all living creatures.
('55', 192, 1, 11, 361688) He cannot do this if he cannot live in a community.
('55', 192, 1, 12, 361740) You must, therefore, strive your best and cultivate this capacity.
('55', 192, 1, 13, 361807) Hence even if you do not meet regularly just now as members of an association, you should do so at least to qualify yourselves to get weekly letters from me and to reply to them.
('55', 192, 1, 14, 361986) In this manner you can make some progress [towards collective living].
('55', 192, 1, 15, 362057) When any of you write to me individually, I do reply to her.
('55', 192, 1, 16, 362118) But since I started the practice of writing a common letter to the women I have realized that I must write regularly something meant for all the women.
('55', 192, 1, 17, 362270) The women should discuss it and I should discuss the questions which they raise.
('55', 192, 1, 18, 362351) I think that I have now made quite clear what I wished to tell you and what I want from you.
('55', 192, 1, 19, 362444) This was only a preface to the letter.
('55', 192, 1, 20, 362483) Trivenibehn has asked me one question which concerns all women.
('55', 192, 1, 21, 362547) Today, therefore, I will discuss that.
('55', 192, 1, 22, 362586) She asks why women, not only the women in the Ashram but all women with whom she has come in contact, look as if they were dead and have no spirit in them at all.
('55', 192, 1, 23, 362749) There is some truth in her description, though of course it will not apply to all women.
('55', 192, 1, 24, 362838) The reasons which I have been able to discover are these: (1) lack of order in womens life; (2) excessive worries; (3) wrong upbringing; (4) adoption of unscientific measures at the time of child birth and during confinement; (5) lack of exercise; (6) eating food which is harmful to health; (7) the habit of remaining within the four walls of the home; (8) the habit of eating things which they ought not to eat; (9) in many cases, harmful thoughts which they do not try to regulate wisely, but repress.
('55', 192, 1, 25, 363343) These are the reasons which I can think of.
('55', 192, 1, 26, 363387) I do not mean that all of them apply in every case.
('55', 192, 1, 27, 363439) Every woman should think and find out which reason applies in her own case.
('55', 192, 1, 28, 363515) I have observed one great
('55', 193, 0, 1, 363541) 194 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 193, 1, 2, 363583) defect in our women, namely, that they hide their thoughts from the world.
('55', 193, 1, 3, 363658) As a result, their behaviour becomes hypocritical.
('55', 193, 1, 4, 363709) This can happen only to those who are habitually hypocritical.
('55', 193, 1, 5, 363772) I do not know anything in the world so poisonous as hypocrisy, and especially when the evil affects our middle class women who are suppressed throughout their lives it eats them up like a canker.
('55', 193, 1, 6, 363968) At every step they do things which they dislike in their hearts, and believe that they must do them.
('55', 193, 1, 7, 364069) If they only think a little, they will realize that they need not let themselves be suppressed by anybody in the world.
('55', 193, 1, 8, 364189) If they learn this first lesson and cultivate the courage to stand before the world just as they are, they will be able to eliminate the other causes which I have mentioned.
('55', 193, 1, 9, 364363) According to me, this is a very important letter.
('55', 193, 1, 10, 364413) Think over it again and again and ask me about anything in it which you do not understand.
('55', 193, 1, 11, 364504) If you read the letter twice or thrice, you will be able to understand it very clearly.

('55', 194, 12, 22, 365970) I did however glance through them.
('55', 194, 12, 23, 366005) They did not produce the impression the friends who sent them to me had expected.
('55', 194, 12, 24, 366087) I have learnt from childhood, and experience has confirmed the soundness of the teaching, that spiritual gifts should not be used for the purpose of healing bodily ailments.
('55', 194, 12, 25, 366261) I do however believe in abstention from

('55', 195, 1, 3, 366691) But this is purely on physical, hygienic grounds.
('55', 195, 1, 4, 366741) I do also believe in utter reliance upon God, but then not in the hope that He will heal me, but in order to submit entirely to His will, and to share the fate of millions who even though they wished to, can have no scientific medical help.
('55', 195, 1, 5, 366982) I am sorry to say, however, that I am not always able to carry out my belief into practice.
('55', 195, 1, 6, 367074) It is my constant endeavour to do so.
('55', 195, 1, 7, 367112) But I find it very difficult, being in the midst of temptation, to enforce my belief in full.

('55', 195, 3, 9, 367239) 229. LETTER TO SURENDRA
('55', 195, 4, 10, 367263) April 4, 1932
('55', 195, 5, 11, 367277) I did get your letter in which you wrote about brahmacharya.
('55', 195, 5, 12, 367338) We shall certainly discuss the subject when we meet.
('55', 195, 5, 13, 367391) The views which I had expressed at Imam Sahebs place have become stronger and are becoming stronger still.
('55', 195, 5, 14, 367498) That is, I find their truth being proved by experience.
('55', 195, 5, 15, 367554) That alone is true brahmacharya which remains inviolate at all times and in all conditions.
('55', 195, 5, 16, 367646) It is extremely difficult to cultivate such a state.
('55', 195, 5, 17, 367699) But that should not be surprising.
('55', 195, 5, 18, 367734) We owe our birth to lust, and love our body which is the fruit of lust.
('55', 195, 5, 19, 367806) It cannot but be difficult to get rid of this heritage of lust.
('55', 195, 5, 20, 367870) However, when we realize that the body is the abode of the priceless atman, our brahmacharya would remain inviolate even if Rambha came down from heaven and embraced us.
('55', 195, 5, 21, 368040) To everybody, his mother is as beautiful as Rambha, and the thought of this Mother Rambha banishes impure thoughts from his mind.
('55', 195, 5, 22, 368170) In like manner, the thought of any woman should banish impure thoughts from ones mind.
('55', 195, 5, 23, 368257) Need I go on?
('55', 195, 5, 24, 368271) Reflect over this again and again and understand all its implications.
('55', 195, 5, 25, 368342) If somebody is pleased by your punishing yourself 1 it is not correct to describe that as the effect of ahimsa.
('55', 195, 5, 26, 368454) But the matter is not important.
('55', 195, 5, 27, 368487) As your faith becomes stronger, your reason will develop.
('55', 195, 5, 28, 368545) The Gita seems to tell us that God Himself gives us the light of reason.
('55', 195, 5, 29, 368618) Our duty is to strengthen our faith.
('55', 195, 5, 30, 368655) It is, of course, necessary to understand the meaning of faith and reason in this context.

('55', 196, 1, 2, 368949) through true humility.
('55', 196, 1, 3, 368972) He who believes that he knows, knows nothing.
('55', 196, 1, 4, 369018) But he who believes that he knows nothing, acquires knowledge at the right time.
('55', 196, 1, 5, 369099) Even God cannot pour Ganga water into a pot that is full.
('55', 196, 1, 6, 369157) We should, therefore, always stand before God with empty hands.
('55', 196, 1, 7, 369221) Our vow of non possession means the same thing.
('55', 196, 1, 8, 369269) But I must stop here.

('55', 196, 11, 20, 369619) MANUDI, I got your letter, and read the whole of it twice.
('55', 196, 11, 21, 369678) You need not be scared.
('55', 196, 11, 22, 369702) It was very good that you saw the woeful condition of Harilal with your own eyes.
('55', 196, 11, 23, 369784) I knew all about him.
('55', 196, 11, 24, 369806) However, we should not give up hope of anyones future.
('55', 196, 11, 25, 369861) Nothing is beyond Gods power?
('55', 196, 11, 26, 369891) If there is still some merit to Harilals credit earned through good deeds in the past, it will bear fruit one day.
('55', 196, 11, 27, 370006) We should not pamper him or have false pity on him, but should make our hearts purer day by day.
('55', 196, 11, 28, 370103) That will have an effect on Harilal too.
('55', 196, 11, 29, 370144) You have got to harden your heart and write to him and tell him plainly that, as long as he does not give up drinking, he will have to assume that you do not exist.
('55', 196, 11, 30, 370309) If all of us adopt such a course, Harilal might take heed.
('55', 196, 11, 31, 370368) Often a drunkard gives up his evil habit when he is greatly shocked.
('55', 196, 11, 32, 370437) I liked your reply about marriage.
('55', 196, 11, 33, 370472) I am sure it will be all to your

('55', 197, 1, 2, 370640) good if you stick to your resolution.
('55', 197, 1, 3, 370678) In your childhood you were so ill that nobody hoped you would live.
('55', 197, 1, 4, 370746) You were saved because of Bas patient nursing and the treatment of the Ice Doctor 1. But owing to that illness, your growth had practically stopped for five years.
('55', 197, 1, 5, 370910) You are weak even now, and but for Balis 2 care, you would become ill again.
('55', 197, 1, 6, 370987) On this account, I always deduct at least five years from your actual age.
('55', 197, 1, 7, 371062) We have already fixed the earliest age for a woman to marry at twenty one years.
('55', 197, 1, 8, 371143) The age, therefore, which you have laid down for yourself for marrying is proper.
('55', 197, 1, 9, 371225) I would regard you as barely fit for marriage at the age of twenty five.
('55', 197, 1, 10, 371298) However, I do not wish to bind you to a pledge.
('55', 197, 1, 11, 371346) I write this only to tell you that your present resolution is right.
('55', 197, 1, 12, 371415) When Rami wished to get married at a younger age, I did not come in her way though I did not at all like that she should have married at that age.
('55', 197, 1, 13, 371562) As for you, there are many reasons why you should not marry early.
('55', 197, 1, 14, 371629) May God keep you firm in your resolution.
('55', 197, 1, 15, 371671) At present your duty is to apply yourself hard to your studies, build up a strong, healthy body, understand the path which Gita teaches and live accordingly.
('55', 197, 1, 16, 371829) Write to me from time to time.
('55', 197, 1, 17, 371860) You may come to see me if you wish.

('55', 198, 1, 2, 372610) I found from my experience of the dates this time.
('55', 198, 1, 3, 372661) I send most of the quantity to the leper hospital here and eat a little from the portion which is not spoiled.

('55', 198, 6, 13, 373135) Pencil handwriting is faint and becomes fainter day by day.
('55', 198, 6, 14, 373195) By the time the person to whom the letter is addressed gets it, the characters have become so faint that he can read the letter with difficulty, and sometimes it cannot be deciphered at all.
('55', 198, 6, 15, 373386) Moreover, with pencil you cannot make your handwriting really good.
('55', 198, 6, 16, 373454) Finally, pencil handwriting cannot be properly judged.
('55', 198, 6, 17, 373509) In future, as long as you can get ink and pen, resolve to use them in writing letters or anything else.

('55', 198, 11, 25, 373934) The teachers cunning will not avail her.

('55', 198, 11, 27, 374094) To do so it seems you must turn yourself into a boy to enter the jail!

('55', 199, 1, 3, 374329) Burn thy pride and smear thy body with its ashes; take up the broom of love and with it wipe out the distinctions of me and thee; reduce the notion of reality to dust and sprinkle it on thy prayer carpet; leave the carpet, break up the rosary, throw the sacred books in the river, seek the help of angels and be their servant; do not fast nor keep Ramzan, do not go to the mosque nor make obeisances; break to pieces the water jar for prayer cleansing and drink the wine of the joy of union; eat and drink but never be off thy guard; enjoy thy intoxication continuously; burn thy egotism.

('55', 199, 2, 7, 375257) It took me nearly three quarters of an hour to write this much.
('55', 199, 2, 8, 375321) The truth is that I should practise writing every day.
('55', 199, 2, 9, 375376) But I am rather ambitious and wishing to do all I can during this quiet interval, I cannot give much time to Urdu.
('55', 199, 2, 10, 375491) It was you who tempted me to try writing Urdu, for you used to write a few Urdu sentences and, trying to write in Urdu myself, I became your pupil !
('55', 199, 2, 11, 375640) What a pupil, and what a teacher !
('55', 199, 2, 12, 375675) It is indeed a great pair we make.

('55', 199, 2, 15, 375817) We remember you all very often.
('55', 199, 2, 16, 375849) Uncle Sardar and Mahadev proudly narrate many incidents about Father.

('55', 200, 3, 6, 376509) I got your postcard yesterday.
('55', 200, 3, 7, 376540) Why has Harilal 1 not written to me himself if he has really reformed himself?
('55', 200, 3, 8, 376619) Maybe he was too ashamed to write, in which case it is all right.
('55', 200, 3, 9, 376685) But there is no reason for him to feel ashamed.
('55', 200, 3, 10, 376733) Even the worst of men have mended themselves.
('55', 200, 3, 11, 376779) And then the world did not remember their earlier faults but on the contrary some of them came to be honoured as devotees.
('55', 200, 3, 12, 376902) If Harilal has really undergone a change of heart I regard it as happy news indeed.
('55', 200, 3, 13, 376986) But I have serious doubts.
('55', 200, 3, 14, 377013) People who are addicted like him often take vows only to break them, They have no spirit left in them.
('55', 200, 3, 15, 377116) They lose the strength to keep a vow.
('55', 200, 3, 16, 377154) Only a few blessed by God are saved.
('55', 200, 3, 17, 377191) I hope that Harilal would be one such.
('55', 200, 3, 18, 377230) Tell him to write.
('55', 200, 3, 19, 377249) 2 You should also keep me informed about him.
('55', 200, 3, 20, 377295) Harilals resolve [you say] is up to the month of Margashirsha according to the calendar followed there.
('55', 200, 3, 21, 377399) What does this mean?
('55', 200, 3, 22, 377420) If he stays perfectly clean up to Margashirsha, does it mean that he will go back to his old ways again?

('55', 201, 1, 7, 378577) However long the night may be it is bound to come to an end.
('55', 201, 1, 8, 378638) For me the same diet continues.
('55', 201, 1, 9, 378670) I feel well on it.
('55', 201, 1, 10, 378689) Do you see Andrews?

('55', 201, 5, 15, 378842) April 5 [1932] 1
('55', 201, 6, 16, 378859) BHAI MAITHILISHARAN, I had your letter.
('55', 201, 6, 17, 378899) I read Saket, Anagh, Panchvati and Jhankar with enjoyment.
('55', 201, 6, 18, 378958) I liked them very much.
('55', 201, 6, 19, 378982) But I do not consider myself at all qualified to make comments.
('55', 201, 6, 20, 379046) However, as you have asked for my opinion and I did gather impressions while reading I am putting them down as they occurred to me.
('55', 201, 6, 21, 379178) The expression of Urmilas grief, though beautiful in style, could hardly have had a place in Saket.
('55', 201, 6, 22, 379278) That Tulsidas did not say much about Urmila has been held against him.
('55', 201, 6, 23, 379349) But this omission I have not viewed as a fault.
('55', 201, 6, 24, 379397) I see in that the artistry of the poet.
('55', 201, 6, 25, 379437) The composition of Manas is such that a worthy character like Urmila is brought to notice only by ellipsis, in that lies the greatness of the work and such characters.
('55', 201, 6, 26, 379605) The character of Urmila and others could have been delineated only to enhance the impact of Sitajis character.
('55', 201, 6, 27, 379716) But Urmilas virtues were of no lesser order than Sitas.
('55', 201, 6, 28, 379772) Sitas sisters were of the same calibre as herself.
('55', 201, 6, 29, 379823) Manas is an incomparable scripture.
('55', 201, 6, 30, 379859) The praise of Sita and Rama rings through every page and every verse.
('55', 201, 6, 31, 379929) I expected to see the same characteristic in Saket.
('55', 201, 6, 32, 379981) I failed in this
('55', 201, 7, 33, 379998) 1 The year is inferred from the contents; vide also Letter to Maithilisharan Gupta, 26 4 1932 and Diary, 1932, entry under April 5.

('55', 202, 1, 2, 380176) to some extent for the reason explained above.
('55', 202, 1, 3, 380223) I may mention one more point.
('55', 202, 1, 4, 380253) The lamentations of Dasharatha and others described in Tulsidass Manas did not jar.
('55', 202, 1, 5, 380337) Tulsidasji could not have done anything different.
('55', 202, 1, 6, 380388) But such lamentations are not appreciated in a book of the present period.
('55', 202, 1, 7, 380463) It affects adversely the sentiment of valour as well as faith.
('55', 202, 1, 8, 380526) Those who have faith in the spirit and who consider worldly pleasures as transitory cannot find death and separation unbearable.
('55', 202, 1, 9, 380655) They might temporarily give way to grief but how can we expect pitiful lamentations from them?
('55', 202, 1, 10, 380750) I do not at all mean by all this that you should try to make any improvements in the second edition.
('55', 202, 1, 11, 380851) But it will be a different matter if you find any worth in my comments.
('55', 202, 1, 12, 380923) Mahadev is now with me.
('55', 202, 1, 13, 380947) I have dictated this to him as the right hand pains and writing with the left hand takes more time.
('55', 202, 2, 14, 381047) Yours MOHANDAS

('55', 202, 6, 18, 381165) BHAI TYAGIJI, I was glad to get your letter and gladder still to learn that you are nursing the plague patients.
('55', 202, 6, 19, 381278) I am not taking milk these days.
('55', 202, 6, 20, 381311) Here I can do with bread, almonds, dates, vegetables and lemons.
('55', 202, 6, 21, 381376) My views are the same as before.
('55', 202, 6, 22, 381409) I am awaiting a letter from Devsharmaji 1. My right hand pains only when writing, but it has been like this for one year and there is nothing special.
('55', 202, 6, 23, 381560) Balvirs handwriting is good.
('55', 202, 6, 24, 381589) Has he got rid of his former faults?
('55', 202, 6, 25, 381626) Mahadev is with me.

('55', 203, 1, 2, 381808) 239. LETTER TO C. F. ANDREWS
('55', 203, 2, 3, 381837) April 7, 1932
('55', 203, 3, 4, 381851) MY DEAR CHARLIE, I have your letters and enclosures, also copy of an article of yours in an old number of Modern Review.
('55', 203, 3, 5, 381972) I understand and even appreciate the moral repulsion against fasting unto death.
('55', 203, 3, 6, 382053) I have perhaps some repulsion, if not the same repulsion, against fasting unto death myself, but I remain unmoved.
('55', 203, 3, 7, 382168) There are many other things I have done and am still doing against my will, because I count my will as nothing before Gods will when I see it clearly before me.
('55', 203, 3, 8, 382329) I will make myself as certain as it is humanly possible to be, that the will that appears to me to be Gods is really His, and not the Devils.
('55', 203, 3, 9, 382471) But when I am clear about it, I rejoice in obeying that will, rather than mine, although I have no human companion to endorse it.
('55', 203, 3, 10, 382601) That this kind of fasting has a definite place in Hinduism, and properly so, I have not a shadow of a doubt, but it is a privilege that comes only to a few, and when it comes in obedience to a call from above, it has a mighty force.
('55', 203, 3, 11, 382834) Only, fasting unto death is a corrupt expression.
('55', 203, 3, 12, 382884) When I used it first, it had its definite meaning.
('55', 203, 3, 13, 382935) Now it is being used torn from its context and looks certainly barbarous.
('55', 203, 3, 14, 383009) But it is there, and its real meaning is unmistakable, and you can almost say that it is not so much of a fast unto death as it is a fasting unto a new life.
('55', 203, 3, 15, 383167) All the same, I value your letter and the information you give me about the English attitude.
('55', 203, 3, 16, 383261) I do want English sympathy in this big struggle.
('55', 203, 3, 17, 383310) I do want also to be understood.
('55', 203, 3, 18, 383343) You cannot therefore be too frank or too communicative with me.
('55', 203, 3, 19, 383407) I shall never misunderstand whatever these few English friends might have to say.
('55', 203, 3, 20, 383489) Kerby Pages article which you have sent I shall see as soon as I get the time, and if there is anything worth saying, I shall reduce it to writing.
('55', 203, 3, 21, 383637) I hope that your brothers septic teeth were extracted and that he had benefited by the extraction.
('55', 203, 3, 22, 383736) You know all about Verriers change of mind.
('55', 203, 3, 23, 383780) 1 He had changed it before your blessings were received, and you know

('55', 204, 1, 2, 383930) the reason also for the change.
('55', 204, 1, 3, 383962) Whilst I was prepared to bless the marriage, I cannot help saying that I blessed the change still more.
('55', 204, 1, 4, 384066) So much depended upon Verriers decision.
('55', 204, 1, 5, 384107) I told him that if it was a human want on his part, he must marry, no matter what misinterpretation might be put upon his action.
('55', 204, 1, 6, 384237) The change came over both Verrier and Mary without any prompting from anybody at all.
('55', 204, 1, 7, 384323) Our love to all.

('55', 204, 9, 17, 384606) April 7, 1932
('55', 204, 10, 18, 384620) The fear of tuberculosis is worse than the disease itself.
('55', 204, 10, 19, 384679) 3 The person who is suspected to have got it is always brooding over the disease and sees its symptoms in every discomfort that he suffers.
('55', 204, 10, 20, 384819) If he can be helped to get rid of this obsession, he recovers very soon.
('55', 204, 10, 21, 384892) Why do you worry over the problem of money?
('55', 204, 10, 22, 384936) 4 You ought to learn this lesson from me, for I am an expert in the subject.
('55', 204, 10, 23, 385013) Long before the country made me a Mahatma, I had learnt that, just as it is bad economics to do business with borrowed money, so it is a false conception of dharma to run a public institution with borrowed money.
('55', 204, 10, 24, 385226) And if the ablest workers of an institution have to go out
('55', 204, 11, 25, 385285) 1 The addressee, an overseer, had asked Gandhiji whether he had attained salvation and seen God face to face.
('55', 204, 11, 26, 385395) 2 Omission as in the source 3 The addressee had mentioned the proposal to remove Gijubhai Badhekas child to Panchgani for treatment.
('55', 204, 11, 27, 385528) 4 The addressee had expressed his fears about the financial position of Dakshinamurti, an educational institution, started by him in Bhavnagar.

('55', 205, 1, 2, 385714) begging for money to run it, I would say that that is like doing business with borrowed money.
('55', 205, 1, 3, 385809) Instead of fixing a specific number, why dont you follow this other method, namely, to admit only as many pupils as you can manage with the money which you get.
('55', 205, 1, 4, 385970) It is the easiest thing in the world to do that.
('55', 205, 1, 5, 386019) You have only to make up your mind; that is all.
('55', 205, 1, 6, 386068) At the beginning of every year, you should estimate the sum which you will need.
('55', 205, 1, 7, 386149) If you get it without having to go begging for it, you should carry on, otherwise you should close the institution.
('55', 205, 1, 8, 386265) Yours is an established institution now, with a glorious record.
('55', 205, 1, 9, 386330) You have efficient teachers.
('55', 205, 1, 10, 386359) Why, then, have you no faith?
('55', 205, 1, 11, 386389) Offer up your venture wholly as sacrifice to the Lord and resolve to run it in His name.
('55', 205, 1, 12, 386478) He will then keep it running if He so wills.
('55', 205, 1, 13, 386523) We have heard of none who loved the Lord and whose honour He did not uphold. We sang this bhajan at the time of the evening prayer today.
('55', 205, 1, 14, 386661) I was reminded of it by a letter which I wrote to a girl.
('55', 205, 1, 15, 386719) You say that the problem would not have worried you if Vallabhbhai or I had been out of jail.
('55', 205, 1, 16, 386813) But where is the problem?
('55', 205, 1, 17, 386839) And if there is any, who are we to solve it?
('55', 205, 1, 18, 386884) Can one blind man lead another blind man?
('55', 205, 1, 19, 386926) If you think that there is a problem, leave it to Him.
('55', 205, 1, 20, 386981) Do not dismiss all this as mere philosophizing, but try to act upon it.

('55', 206, 3, 4, 387688) MIRA, I have your letter.
('55', 206, 3, 5, 387714) 1 It seems to me that the trouble with the right hand will persist.
('55', 206, 3, 6, 387782) On coming here I began writing freely with the right hand and I soon discovered that it was no use.
('55', 206, 3, 7, 387882) It may be one sign of creeping old age.
('55', 206, 3, 8, 387922) If it is, it is cause neither for grief nor wonder.
('55', 206, 3, 9, 387974) Had I learnt to use the body merely as an instrument of service and His temple, old age would have been like a beautiful ripe fruit with all the qualities of its species at their highest.
('55', 206, 3, 10, 388162) It would be a stroke of good fortune if I escape merely with such disability.
('55', 206, 3, 11, 388240) But even this is idle speculation.
('55', 206, 3, 12, 388275) I have no business to speculate about these things.
('55', 206, 3, 13, 388327) It is enough to note such things and take reasonable precautions within the prescribed limits.
('55', 206, 3, 14, 388422) You will not therefore worry about the hand.
('55', 206, 3, 15, 388467) My weight stands at 106 lb.
('55', 206, 3, 16, 388495) except for the fasting day when it naturally dropped to 103_.
('55', 206, 3, 17, 388557) I take during 24 hours five to six slices of well toasted white bread, 30 dates, bowlful of boiled vegetable once, two spoonful of honey at 4.15 a.m.
('55', 206, 3, 18, 388707) with a pinch of soda and hot water and soda and lemon 2 twice.
('55', 206, 3, 19, 388770) I take two ounces (nearly) of almond paste.
('55', 206, 3, 20, 388814) This seems to satisfy me; if it fails, I shall go back to milk.
('55', 206, 3, 21, 388878) The bowels move perfectly twice or thrice daily without my medicament or appliances.
('55', 206, 3, 22, 388963) I sleep between 9 and 3.40 and twice during the daytime 20 minutes each time.
('55', 206, 3, 23, 389041) I spin 375 rounds in two days.
('55', 206, 3, 24, 389072) I have not begun carding yet.
('55', 206, 3, 25, 389102) Your supply 3 seems to be inexhaustible.
('55', 206, 3, 26, 389143) The balance of the time is given to reading and writing.
('55', 206, 3, 27, 389200) Just now I am reading Ruskins Fors Clavigera, a deeply human document.
('55', 206, 3, 28, 389271) He is dreadfully in earnest.
('55', 206, 3, 29, 389300) These letters are his last effort at self expression in word and deed.
('55', 206, 3, 30, 389371) Much time is taken up in writing and now also dictating letters.
('55', 206, 3, 31, 389436) As I am allowed to write to fellow prisoners, naturally there is more writing to be done than last time.
('55', 206, 3, 32, 389541) I am glad of it.
('55', 206, 3, 33, 389558) I sendsomething on moral problems to the Ashram every week.And now I have commenced the history 4 of the Ashram for the past five

('55', 207, 1, 2, 390026) This answers all your questions about self.
('55', 207, 1, 3, 390070) Vallabhbhai and Mahadev are doing excellently....
('55', 207, 1, 4, 390120) 1 In these matters we are subject to no restrictions that we would not impose upon ourselves.
('55', 207, 2, 5, 390214) Abstention from salt for a time can do no harm and does produce the results you have noticed for yourself.
('55', 207, 2, 6, 390321) The weakening effect you notice is temporary and can be greatly counteracted by taking fresh limes in some shape or other.
('55', 207, 2, 7, 390444) I suppose you know that I have gone without salt continuously for six or eight years without noticing any ill effect.
('55', 207, 2, 8, 390562) Many had joined me in the experiment, you may therefore prolong your saltless experiment to the extent that it benefits you.
('55', 207, 2, 9, 390687) Milk contains much free salt.
('55', 207, 2, 10, 390717) There is a saltish taste in raw milk.
('55', 207, 3, 11, 390755) I understand and appreciate all you say about yourself.
('55', 207, 3, 12, 390811) Let me put you at ease.
('55', 207, 3, 13, 390835) When I come out you shall certainly be with me and resume your original work of personal service.
('55', 207, 3, 14, 390933) I quite clearly see that it is the only way for your self expansion.
('55', 207, 3, 15, 391002) I shall no longer be guilty as I have been before of thwarting you in any way whatsoever.
('55', 207, 3, 16, 391092) My only consolation in thinking over the past is that in all I did I was guided by nothing else than the deepest love for you and regard for your well being.
('55', 207, 3, 17, 391250) I see once more that good government is no substitute for self government.
('55', 207, 3, 18, 391325) 2 A Gujarati proverb says what one sees for oneself may not be visible to the nearest friend even though he may have ever 3 so powerful a searchlight.
('55', 207, 3, 19, 391476) Both these proverbs may not be universally applicable.
('55', 207, 3, 20, 391531) They certainly are in your case.
('55', 207, 3, 21, 391564) You need therefore fear no interference from me henceforth.
('55', 207, 3, 22, 391624) And who can give me more loving service than you?
('55', 207, 4, 23, 391674) Mahadev has the hymns you sent him.
('55', 207, 4, 24, 391710) He is going to work at them.
('55', 207, 4, 25, 391739) I forgot to tell you that I have now developed the habit of studying the heavens.
('55', 207, 4, 26, 391821) As you see my pen is exhausted.
('55', 207, 4, 27, 391853) This is Mahadevs.
('55', 207, 4, 28, 391871) And it is now past bed time, 9.15. But I think I have left

('55', 208, 1, 2, 392198) nothing unanswered.
('55', 208, 1, 3, 392218) I have a full letter from Nurgis about Jal.
('55', 208, 1, 4, 392262) What a deliverance!
('55', 208, 1, 5, 392282) Love from us all.

('55', 208, 4, 8, 392452) 244. LETTER TO KUSUM DESAI
('55', 208, 5, 9, 392479) April 8, 1932
('55', 208, 6, 10, 392493) KUSUM (SENIOR) , I got your letters.
('55', 208, 6, 11, 392530) I did get Pyarelals letter, and had also replied to him.
('55', 208, 6, 12, 392587) You should now learn to pronounce Sanskrit words correctly and learn the grammar too.
('55', 208, 6, 13, 392673) This in addition to spinning on takli.
('55', 208, 6, 14, 392712) Do you suffer from constipation?
('55', 208, 6, 15, 392745) You should improve your health.
('55', 208, 6, 16, 392777) I had liked the first part of Saraswatichandra 1 very much, but you ought to read all the four parts.
('55', 208, 6, 17, 392879) You should also read the four parts of Kavyadohan.
('55', 208, 6, 18, 392930) Besides, you should read Karanghelo 2 and Vanaraj Chavdo, as also some writings of Narmadashankar 3 and Manilal Nabhubhai 4. If you read these works, you will have a complete understanding of the nature of the Gujarati language.
('55', 208, 6, 19, 393159) Perhaps you yourself can collect these books and send them.
('55', 208, 6, 20, 393219) I didnt know at all about the Raleigh bicycle having come to India.
('55', 208, 6, 21, 393287) I will write to Kingsley Hall.
('55', 208, 6, 22, 393318) I got Rollands books.
('55', 208, 6, 23, 393340) I will read them.
('55', 208, 6, 24, 393358) Taradevi 5 is here.
('55', 208, 6, 25, 393378) I had even a letter from her.
('55', 208, 6, 26, 393408) She and the other women are quite happy.
('55', 208, 6, 27, 393449) She has asked for a copy of the Ramayana.
('55', 208, 6, 28, 393491) I will send one to her.
('55', 208, 6, 29, 393515) I got two letters from Sushila.
('55', 208, 6, 30, 393547) If she could pick up enough courage to write, she wouldnt be Pyarelals sister, [would she?
('55', 208, 6, 31, 393638) ] The book about Lancashire has gone to [Chhaganlal] Joshi.
('55', 208, 6, 32, 393698) I will read it when it comes back to me, and give my opinion.
('55', 208, 6, 33, 393760) I have not collected many books this time.
('55', 208, 6, 34, 393803) But I do receive some from time to
('55', 208, 7, 35, 393838) 1 Gujarati novel by Govardhanram Tripathi 2 Gujarati novel by Nandshankar Mehta 3 1833 86; Gujarati poet, popularly known as Kavi Narmad 4 Dwivedi (1858 98); Gujarati man of letters and Vedantist thinker 5 Pyarelals mother
('55', 209, 0, 1, 394061) 210 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 209, 1, 2, 394103) I have not yet come across any which I should like to send toyou.
('55', 209, 1, 3, 394169) I have received the volumes of Ruskins Fors Clavigera; if you wish, I may send them to you.
('55', 209, 1, 4, 394261) Pyarelal will hardly get anything new even from them.
('55', 209, 1, 5, 394315) I get letters from Muriel, Agatha and Horace.
('55', 209, 1, 6, 394361) My weight remains what it was, that is, 106 lb.
('55', 209, 1, 7, 394409) This is the food which I take: almonds crushed into paste, dates, toast, lemon juice and a boiled vegetable with one meal.
('55', 209, 1, 8, 394532) So far I have been able to do without milk.
('55', 209, 1, 9, 394576) This time I dont suffer from constipation at all.
('55', 209, 1, 10, 394626) The hours of sleep have increased.
('55', 209, 1, 11, 394661) I see that the weakness of the hand persists but I feel no pain.
('55', 209, 1, 12, 394726) I read only for a little while.
('55', 209, 1, 13, 394758) Just now I am reading Ruskins Fors.
('55', 209, 1, 14, 394794) As for writing, I have finished the remaining discourses on the Gita.
('55', 209, 1, 15, 394864) I have now taken in hand a history of the Ashram.
('55', 209, 1, 16, 394914) I dictate to Mahadev.
('55', 209, 1, 17, 394936) The letters to Ashram inmates take a good deal of my time, particularly because I write with the left hand.
('55', 209, 1, 18, 395044) Spinning takes from one and a half to two hours.
('55', 209, 1, 19, 395093) Because of the trouble with the hand I deliberately do not spin longer.
('55', 209, 1, 20, 395165) I have made it a rule to spin 375 rounds in two days.
('55', 209, 1, 21, 395219) I have not carded any cotton so far.
('55', 209, 1, 22, 395256) I have still a stock of the slivers which Mira left with me.
('55', 209, 1, 23, 395317) Mahadev has started carding.
('55', 209, 1, 24, 395346) I was going to ask you about Harilal 1, but meanwhile you have picked up courage to question me on the subject.
('55', 209, 1, 25, 395458) I wished to ask you what you had done, and now you have turned round on me.
('55', 209, 1, 26, 395534) My condition remains.
('55', 209, 1, 27, 395556) Why cannot you write?
('55', 209, 1, 28, 395578) You should write what you can; it will be for me to revise and pass what you write.
('55', 209, 1, 29, 395662) You should overcome your hesitation and start writing.
('55', 209, 1, 30, 395717) It is probably out of lethargy that you do not try at all.
('55', 209, 1, 31, 395776) If so, overcome your lethargy.
('55', 209, 1, 32, 395807) If you do this, I will keep my promise of writing a foreword.
('55', 209, 1, 33, 395869) The book cannot be published just now, but it is very desirable that the writing should be over.
('55', 209, 1, 34, 395966) I may not perhaps be able to write the foreword after I am released.
('55', 209, 1, 35, 396035) I hope you realize that there is a reason for my insisting that you should start writing.
('55', 209, 1, 36, 396125) There will be no grace in publishing the letters without your essay.
('55', 209, 1, 37, 396194) You ought not to do that.
('55', 209, 2, 38, 396220) Blessings from BAPU

('55', 210, 1, 2, 396460) 245. LETTER TO PREMABEHN KANTAK
('55', 210, 2, 3, 396492) April 8, 1932
('55', 210, 3, 4, 396506) PREMA, Since Dhurandhar is here, I shall probably see him some time.
('55', 210, 3, 5, 396575) Instead of wishing to kill many birds with one stone, why not wish to bring down many berries with one hit?
('55', 210, 3, 6, 396683) You should never wish to kill a bird.
('55', 210, 3, 7, 396721) It was fortunate that you escaped being hurt by the tile.
('55', 210, 3, 8, 396779) 1 We should conclude from this that you are destined to do much more.
('55', 210, 3, 9, 396849) You need not at all feel confused about the problem concerning the women.
('55', 210, 3, 10, 396923) You may give your services if they want them and if you have confidence in yourself.
('55', 210, 3, 11, 397008) Otherwise you should forget the suggestion as if it had never been made.
('55', 210, 3, 12, 397081) You should have confidence in yourself not about your ability to teach the women, but about your humility, about your ability not to let any mis understanding occur and to manage any difficult situation that may arise.
('55', 210, 3, 13, 397300) We often hesitate to undertake a responsibility out of fear of humiliation, misund erstanding, etc.
('55', 210, 3, 14, 397400) If you can overcome such hesitation, you may take up the responsibility.
('55', 210, 3, 15, 397473) You do believe that all the women are good by nature.
('55', 210, 3, 16, 397527) They require the help of someone who can express their thoughts in words and maintain records for them.
('55', 210, 3, 17, 397631) An illiterate mother may have more sense and practical wisdom than her educated daughter, but, being illiterate, she may not be able to use them.
('55', 210, 3, 18, 397777) A daughter can supply this deficiency.
('55', 210, 3, 19, 397816) I should like you to do that.
('55', 210, 3, 20, 397846) I certainly dont believe that the Association was doing very good work when Gangabehn was there.
('55', 210, 3, 21, 397943) But on one pretext or another, she could bring all of them together.
('55', 210, 3, 22, 398012) It was her ambition to do this work and she sowed the seed.
('55', 210, 3, 23, 398072) She is doing similar work here too.
('55', 210, 3, 24, 398108) I should like to see that seed grown into a tree.
('55', 210, 3, 25, 398158) The women certainly do social work, but as individuals.
('55', 210, 3, 26, 398214) I should like them to assume responsibility as a body, for some social service.
('55', 210, 3, 27, 398294) This will create in them capacity for organization.
('55', 210, 3, 28, 398346) When such capacity has been created, individuals may come and go but the organization will remain.
('55', 210, 3, 29, 398445) God has given such capacity only to human beings.
('55', 210, 3, 30, 398495) In our country, women have not

('55', 211, 0, 1, 398636) 212 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 211, 1, 2, 398678) cultivated it so far.
('55', 211, 1, 3, 398700) The blame for this lies with the men.
('55', 211, 1, 4, 398738) But that is a question with which we need not concern ourselves just now.
('55', 211, 1, 5, 398812) If we believe that women must acquire this capacity for organization, we should try to cultivate it in them.
('55', 211, 1, 6, 398921) It does not matter if we commence only with my writing a letter to their Association and their replying to me.
('55', 211, 1, 7, 399032) Slowly (no matter, if very slowly) we may take up other activities.
('55', 211, 1, 8, 399100) If you have fully understood what I have suggested and if the suggestion has appealed to you, if the other women also approve of it and if they are ready to take interest in carrying it out, you may take up this work.
('55', 211, 1, 9, 399318) If, however, you see difficulties in carrying it out or see no meaning in it, you may drop the idea.
('55', 211, 1, 10, 399419) Dont pay attention just now to my request 1 to you to send me a list of books.
('55', 211, 1, 11, 399498) I dont want you, for the present, to send anything besides the books of Upton Sinclair which I have asked you to send.
('55', 211, 1, 12, 399617) I dont at all like the practice of converting a person from one religion to another.
('55', 211, 1, 13, 399702) I dont believe that marriage between a man and a woman professing different faiths is impossible or always undesirable.
('55', 211, 1, 14, 399822) I think the distinguishing features of Hinduism are cow protection and varnashrama.
('55', 211, 1, 15, 399906) Any nation that wants to rise should follow the path of truth and non violence.
('55', 211, 1, 16, 399986) I think I have answered all your questions.
('55', 211, 2, 17, 400030) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] My copy of the Gujarati Jodanikosh, second edition, published by the Vidyapith, is Iying there.

('55', 211, 6, 22, 400313) I got your letter and the Gujarati Gita and Ramayana.
('55', 211, 6, 23, 400367) I thank Maharajshri for both.

('55', 212, 1, 2, 400670) But nowadays learning and goodness rarely go together.
('55', 212, 1, 3, 400725) Hence I am a little indifferent towards such activities.
('55', 212, 1, 4, 400782) I am similarly indifferent, or even a little more so, towards public readings of the Gita and the Ramayana.
('55', 212, 1, 5, 400890) I put no value on such readings by persons who do not understand the meaning of what they read, or even if they understand it, read the scriptures loudlyas if merely doing that would earn them holy merit or read them for show or for fame.
('55', 212, 1, 6, 401129) I even believe that such readings actually do harm.
('55', 212, 1, 7, 401181) If Maharajshri has found a remedy for these evils and has succeeded in avoiding them in the readings organized by him, I have no doubt that they will do good to the people.
('55', 212, 1, 8, 401354) It should be remembered that I am a prisoner and a letter of this kind should not be used in public.
('55', 212, 1, 9, 401455) I request you, therefore, to be careful in this matter.

('55', 212, 6, 14, 401610) 1 and 2. We must believe in God if we believe in ourselves.
('55', 212, 6, 15, 401670) If living beings have existence God is the sum total of all life and this in my view is the strongest proof.
('55', 212, 6, 16, 401779) 3. The denial of God is injurious in the same way as denial of ourselves.
('55', 212, 6, 17, 401853) That is to say, to deny God is like committingsuicide.
('55', 212, 6, 18, 401908) The fact remains that it is one thing to believe in God and quite another to realize God emotionally and act accordingly.
('55', 212, 6, 19, 402030) Truly, no one in the world is an atheist; atheism is merely a pose.
('55', 212, 6, 20, 402098) 4. One can realize God only by ridding oneself totally of attachment, aversion, etc., and in no other way.
('55', 212, 6, 21, 402205) I hold that one who claims to have realized God has not truly done so.
('55', 212, 6, 22, 402276) Realization can be experienced, but is beyond description.
('55', 212, 6, 23, 402335) Of this I have no doubt.
('55', 212, 6, 24, 402360) 5. I can live only by having faith in God.
('55', 212, 6, 25, 402403) My definition of God must always be kept in mind.
('55', 212, 6, 26, 402453) For me there is no other God than Truth; Truth is God.

('55', 214, 3, 4, 403803) MANU, Your letter was well written.
('55', 214, 3, 5, 403839) The handwriting ought to improve.
('55', 214, 3, 6, 403873) How did you fall ill?

('55', 214, 8, 12, 404074) CHI., People worship the sacred tulsi because the plant is believed to possess certain virtues.
('55', 214, 8, 13, 404170) One should be angry with anger itself.
('55', 214, 8, 14, 404209) Because the other person forgets himself or herself, why should we do the same?
('55', 214, 8, 15, 404289) Grown up people also do wrong in getting angry.
('55', 214, 8, 16, 404337) Even when they become angry, one should cling to what one [believes] 2 to be the truth.
('55', 214, 8, 17, 404425) Did you get the letter which your elder brother 3 wrote to you?

('55', 214, 13, 23, 404696) Anybody who attempts to do something which is beyond his capacity lacks wisdom.
('55', 214, 13, 24, 404776) He deserves compliments who does his duty to the best of his ability.
('55', 214, 13, 25, 404846) Really speaking, a person need not be complimented for his devotion

('55', 215, 10, 14, 405614) April 9, 1932
('55', 215, 11, 15, 405628) JAMNALAL, All of us had been eagerly awaiting a letter from you.
('55', 215, 11, 16, 405693) It was a full one.
('55', 215, 11, 17, 405712) I am very happy that the food in this jail has agreed with you.
('55', 215, 11, 18, 405776) I had heard about Janakibehn and Kamalnayan.
('55', 215, 11, 19, 405821) If Vinoba has not taken a vow to the contrary, I think it is necessary that he should drink milk.
('55', 215, 11, 20, 405919) Even in that jail he seems to have adopted a strenuous programme.
('55', 215, 11, 21, 405985) In order to be able to keep it up, I think he should drink milk.
('55', 215, 11, 22, 406050) I am convinced that there must be some vegetable food which has the beneficial properties of milk but is free from its noxious one.
('55', 215, 11, 23, 406182) But those vaids who are sufficiently well read in their science to be able to discover it have never thought about the possibility of there being such a food and the task is beyond the capacity of laymen like us.
('55', 215, 11, 24, 406395) Or perhaps we can discover it, if we give all our attention to this one problem.
('55', 215, 11, 25, 406476) It is my firm conviction that it would be improper for any of us to do so.
('55', 215, 11, 26, 406551) It is therefore our duty to cling to the task which has fallen to our lot unsought.
('55', 215, 11, 27, 406635) I cannot help thinking that it is not proper for Vinoba to let his weight fall so low.
('55', 216, 0, 1, 406722) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 217
('55', 216, 1, 2, 406768) A fine group seems to have formed there with you.
('55', 216, 1, 3, 406818) I envy you your C class.
('55', 216, 1, 4, 406843) I had felt very happy when I heard that you were placed in that class.
('55', 216, 1, 5, 406914) I did not at all feel afraid that it might affect your health.
('55', 216, 1, 6, 406977) I have never doubted your ability to safeguard your own health and that of your companions.
('55', 216, 1, 7, 407069) Had you not been placed in C class, you would never have got the experience you are nowgetting.Tell Pyarelal that, as I have fully replied 1 to the letter which Kusum wrote at his instance, I dont dictate anything here.
('55', 216, 1, 8, 407289) He will probably get that reply before you get this letter.
('55', 216, 1, 9, 407349) Let me know if he does not.
('55', 216, 1, 10, 407377) All three of us are very well.
('55', 216, 1, 11, 407408) For the past two months, my diet has been bread, almonds, dates, one vegetable and a sour lime.
('55', 216, 1, 12, 407504) This keeps me all right.
('55', 216, 1, 13, 407529) I never feel the need for a laxative or an enema.
('55', 216, 1, 14, 407579) I am engaged at present in writing the history of the Ashram.
('55', 216, 1, 15, 407641) Writing letters takes up a good deal of my time.
('55', 216, 1, 16, 407690) In this small circle, we talk about you several times daily.
('55', 216, 1, 17, 407751) Convey our regards to all.

('55', 216, 6, 23, 407916) SHARDA, It is possible even to win a kingdom by truth, which means that there is nothing that cannot be attained with the help of truth.
('55', 216, 6, 24, 408053) But this does not mean that one should make such an attempt.
('55', 216, 6, 25, 408114) To do so would be tantamount to putting God to test.
('55', 216, 6, 26, 408167) He who worships God would covet no kingdom.
('55', 216, 6, 27, 408211) For him kingdom consists in following the path of truth.
('55', 216, 6, 28, 408268) I love all languages.
('55', 216, 6, 29, 408290) The meaning of yajna has been continually expanding.
('55', 216, 6, 30, 408343) Gujarati womens dress is quite good.
('55', 216, 6, 31, 408380) It requires two changes: an underwear, and a shirt in place of the blouse.

('55', 217, 3, 4, 408658) CHI., It depends on the nature of the vow.
('55', 217, 3, 5, 408701) Someone may take a vow of spinning for a certain number of hours, and another person may take a vow of spinning a certain number of rounds.
('55', 217, 3, 6, 408841) Some others may take a vow in regard to both, that is, to spin a minimum number of rounds and for a minimum number of hours.
('55', 217, 3, 7, 408966) One must fulfil in letter and spirit the vow which one has taken.
('55', 217, 3, 8, 409032) Our emotions and desires are sometimes ruled by God and sometimes by Satan.
('55', 217, 3, 9, 409108) We are tossed between them and that is why our emotions and desires are constantly changing.

('55', 217, 13, 22, 409687) That one should not speak anything to cause pain to a person does not mean that one should not speak anything which might pain him.
('55', 217, 13, 23, 409819) Though the speaker did not wish to cause pain, it is possible that

('55', 218, 1, 2, 409932) the other person will feel hurt.
('55', 218, 1, 3, 409965) When a father tells his son not to drink bhang, he does not wish to cause him pain but the latter [being addicted to bhang], feels hurt.
('55', 218, 1, 4, 410102) Nevertheless, it was the fathers duty to forbid the son to drink bhang.

('55', 218, 6, 11, 410415) DEAR BOYS AND GIRLS, I hope to get in the next letter a short report of your programme of work during the National Week 2. We here have not been able to do anything besides fasting and spinning a little more than on other days.
('55', 218, 6, 12, 410643) You still make mistakes in spelling words.
('55', 218, 6, 13, 410686) See that such mistakes do not occur.
('55', 218, 6, 14, 410723) You should learn from my deficiencies.
('55', 218, 6, 15, 410762) We have had that Jodani Kosh prepared in a hurry for people like you.
('55', 218, 6, 16, 410832) If you really keep awake during prayers, you have certainly advanced one step.
('55', 218, 6, 17, 410911) Mother Gita has already answered the question, What makes us commit sin? Desire and anger do that.
('55', 218, 6, 18, 411010) All of you will be able to see this truth if you recollect your own actions of this type in the past.
('55', 218, 6, 19, 411112) Think and verify the truth of this.
('55', 218, 6, 20, 411148) The Students Union is not independent to the extent that it functions subject to the Ashram rules.
('55', 218, 6, 21, 411247) The freedom of all such associations is limited to some extent.
('55', 218, 6, 22, 411311) The Students Union is of course free in its own field.
('55', 218, 6, 23, 411366) If I liked any manual work worth the name in my student days, I may perhaps say that I liked book binding and carpentry.
('55', 218, 6, 24, 411487) There are so many crafts and industries relating to spinning alone that the question of selecting some other work in addition does not arise.
('55', 218, 6, 25, 411629) In order to have a full knowledge of the science of spinning, one must have some knowledge of each of the following: agriculture, chemistry,

('55', 219, 1, 3, 412128) Think for yourselves and see whether a general knowledge of the subjects just mentioned is or is not essential for [proficiency in the] science of spinning.
('55', 219, 1, 4, 412285) I have enumerated here only the arts and the crafts which I could remember.
('55', 219, 1, 5, 412361) If you sit together and discuss, you will find some more to add to the list.
('55', 219, 1, 6, 412438) Let me know if you can think of more.
('55', 219, 1, 7, 412476) I hope that you will preserve my list at least.
('55', 219, 1, 8, 412524) We worship Krishna the perfect avatar of God and not the Krishna who is supposed to have done so many bad things.

('55', 221, 3, 12, 415661) We must hope that you avail yourself fully of the two thirds left and that you may be granted all means of service.
('55', 221, 3, 13, 415777) As you have the right aspirations I am sure that you will gradually develop the necessary strength of character and other qualities.
('55', 221, 3, 14, 415910) Continue writing.
('55', 221, 3, 15, 415928) I do get news about Devdas but there has been no recent news about Krishnan Nair.
('55', 221, 3, 16, 416010) I have been keeping excellent health, so have Sardar Vallabhbhai and Mahadev.
('55', 221, 3, 17, 416088) I have given up milk for the last two months and take almonds instead.
('55', 221, 3, 18, 416159) I take bread, one vegetable and lemons since giving up milk and seem to be thriving so far.
('55', 221, 3, 19, 416251) The weight is the same, i.e., 106 lb., as when I entered the jail.
('55', 221, 3, 20, 416318) The Gita Shabdanukrama was finished last year.
('55', 221, 3, 21, 416365) At present I am writing the history of the Ashram.
('55', 221, 3, 22, 416416) I read a little and of course spin.

('55', 222, 10, 13, 417062) A lover of truth feels undiminished joy till the end of his life.
('55', 222, 10, 14, 417128) He never regards himself as too old to keep on striving for a vision of the God of Truth.
('55', 222, 10, 15, 417218) He who undertakes every activity in order to see God, also called Truth, who sees Truth in everything [that exists] will not find old age an obstacle [in his quest].
('55', 222, 10, 16, 417384) So far as that quest is concerned, the seeker regards himself as immortal and for ever young.
('55', 222, 10, 17, 417478) I, for one, have been in this beautiful state of mind for years.
('55', 222, 10, 18, 417543) I have never felt old age as an obstacle to devoting myself to learning anything which I believed would take me nearer to the God of Truth.
('55', 222, 10, 19, 417683) A recent example of this is my desire for a study of the heavens.
('55', 222, 10, 20, 417749) Deep in my heart, I had felt often enough the desire to know something about the stars, but I had assumed that the numerous activities which claimed my attention did not permit me to satisfy it.
('55', 222, 10, 21, 417944) Maybe my belief was wrong, but so long as I did not myself see the error in it it could not but prevent me from making the necessary effort.
('55', 222, 10, 22, 418085) I think most probably I myself had prompted Shankerlal, during our

('55', 223, 1, 2, 418489) imprisonment in 1922 [to take up this study].
('55', 223, 1, 3, 418535) Books on the subject were received.
('55', 223, 1, 4, 418571) Shankerlal picked up enough knowledge to satisfy him.
('55', 223, 1, 5, 418625) I could find no time!
('55', 223, 1, 6, 418647) In 1930 31, I had the good fortune to enjoy Kakasahebs company [in jail].
('55', 223, 1, 7, 418721) He was well versed in this subject.
('55', 223, 1, 8, 418757) But I did not avail myself of the opportunity, for my desire was not strong enough then.
('55', 223, 1, 9, 418846) In 1931, I was filled with sudden enthusiasm during the last month of my stay in jail.
('55', 223, 1, 10, 418933) Why should I not give time to watch that which, to the outward eye, instantaneously reveals the presence of God?
('55', 223, 1, 11, 419046) How pathetic that one should see like an animal merely with the physical eye without the grand sight penetrating to the sensory nerves behind?
('55', 223, 1, 12, 419189) How could I let go this fine opportunity to watch the great divine lila 1?
('55', 223, 1, 13, 419264) I am now quenching the thirst which was awakened then for a knowledge of the heavens, and I have progressed so far that I cannot restrain myself from sharing with inmates of the Ashram the thoughts which fill my mind.
('55', 223, 1, 14, 419482) We are taught right from our childhood that our bodies are made of the five great elementsearth, water, akash, light and air.
('55', 223, 1, 15, 419608) We ought to know something about them, but in fact we know very little.
('55', 223, 1, 16, 419680) At the moment we are concerned with akash.
('55', 223, 1, 17, 419723) Akash means space.
('55', 223, 1, 18, 419742) If there were no space in our bodies, we would not be able to live even for a moment.
('55', 223, 1, 19, 419828) This is true about the universe too.
('55', 223, 1, 20, 419865) Our earth is surrounded by infinite space.
('55', 223, 1, 21, 419908) The blue which we see extending over us in all directions is akash.
('55', 223, 1, 22, 419976) The earth has poles.
('55', 223, 1, 23, 419997) It is a solid sphere, and its axis is 7,900 miles long.
('55', 223, 1, 24, 420053) But the akash is empty space.
('55', 223, 1, 25, 420083) If we imagine this space to have an axis, we shall have to imagine it to be of infinite length.
('55', 223, 1, 26, 420179) In this infinite space, the earth is like a mere particle of sand, and on this particle of sand each one of us is a particle, of such infinitesimal size that it is impossible to explain how small it is.
('55', 223, 1, 27, 420382) There is, therefore, no exaggeration at all in saying that, as bodies, we are mere ciphers.
('55', 223, 1, 28, 420474) Our body, as compared with the size of the earth, is a thousand times more insignificant than an ants is as compared with ours.
('55', 223, 1, 29, 420602) Why, then, should we feel attached to it?
('55', 223, 1, 30, 420644) Why should we grieve when a body perishes?
('55', 223, 1, 31, 420687) However, though in itself the human body is insignificant, it has indeed great value, for it is the house of the atman, in truth of the Paramatman, of the God of Truth, if we but realize it.
('55', 223, 2, 32, 420878) 1 Play, sport
('55', 224, 0, 1, 420892) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 225
('55', 224, 1, 2, 420938) If this thought sinks deep into our heart, we would never want to make it an instrument of enjoying gross pleasures.
('55', 224, 1, 3, 421055) And if we fill our imagination with the heavens and, realizing the meaning of their vastness, understand our utter insignificance, all our pride would vanish.
('55', 224, 1, 4, 421214) If the countless shining divinities in the sky did not exist, we would not have come into existence.
('55', 224, 1, 5, 421315) Inspite of the many discoveries of astronomers, our knowledge about the sky is practically nil.
('55', 224, 1, 6, 421411) What little we know tells us beyond the shadow of a doubt that if the sun god rested even for a day from his ever ceaseless tapascharya, we would perish.
('55', 224, 1, 7, 421565) Likewise, if the moon stopped raining down her cool rays, we would meet with the same fate.
('55', 224, 1, 8, 421657) And we can also infer that the countless stars which we see in the sky at night have some role in maintaining this world in existence.
('55', 224, 1, 9, 421792) Thus, we are most intimately connected with every living creature in the world and with everything that exists; everything depends for its existence on everything else.
('55', 224, 1, 10, 421961) Hence we ought to try and know something about our benefactors the shining divinities gliding in the sky.
('55', 224, 1, 11, 422067) There is one more reason why we ought to do this.
('55', 224, 1, 12, 422117) We have a saying among us: The hills look beautiful from a distance. There is much truth in this saying.
('55', 224, 1, 13, 422222) The sun, which keeps us alive from a distance, would instantly burn us to ashes if we went near it.
('55', 224, 1, 14, 422322) This is also true about the other heavenly bodies.
('55', 224, 1, 15, 422373) Since we know both the beneficial and the harmful properties of the things which surround us on this earth, we may sometimes feel aversion to them and even feel ourselves polluted by physical contact with some of them.
('55', 224, 1, 16, 422592) Of the divinities in the sky, however, we know only the merits.
('55', 224, 1, 17, 422656) Hence we never tire of watching them.
('55', 224, 1, 18, 422694) Knowledge about them can never harm us.
('55', 224, 1, 19, 422734) Moreover, as we meditate on these divinities, we can raise our imagination with ennobling ideas as high as we wish.
('55', 224, 1, 20, 422850) There is no doubt at all that every obstacle which we place between ourselves and the sky harms us physically, mentally and spiritually.
('55', 224, 1, 21, 422987) If we lived in a natural state, we would live under the sky for all the twenty four hours of the day.
('55', 224, 1, 22, 423089) If we cannot do that, we should spend in the open as many hours as we can.
('55', 224, 1, 23, 423164) We can watch the heavens, i.e., the stars, only at night, and we can do that best Iying on our backs.
('55', 224, 1, 24, 423266) Hence, anybody who wishes to derive the utmost profit from the observation of the stars should sleep in the open directly under the sky.
('55', 224, 1, 25, 423403) If there are tall buildings or trees near the place where one is sleeping, they will obstruct the view.
('55', 225, 0, 1, 423507) 226 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 225, 1, 2, 423549) Both children and grown ups love dramas and the spectacular scenes which they present.
('55', 225, 1, 3, 423636) But no drama composed or acted by human beings can even equal the great spectacle which Nature has arranged for us on the stage of the sky.
('55', 225, 1, 4, 423776) Moreover, in a theatre we may harm our eyes, breathe unclean air and also run a great risk of our moral sense being weakened.
('55', 225, 1, 5, 423902) On the other hand, this drama arranged by Nature can do us nothing but good.
('55', 225, 1, 6, 423979) Watching the stars soothes the eyes; to watch the stars, one must remain outdoors, and this gives fresh air to the lungs; and we have heard of no instance so far of harm having been done to moral character by watching the stars.
('55', 225, 1, 7, 424208) The more we meditate on this miracle of God, the more we grow spiritually.
('55', 225, 1, 8, 424283) Anybody who is afflicted by impure thoughts and gets dreams in his sleep should try to sleep in the open and let himself be absorbed in watching the stars.
('55', 225, 1, 9, 424439) He will soon fall into dreamless sleep.
('55', 225, 1, 10, 424479) When we are totally absorbed in the grand spectacle in the heavens, we seem to hear those shining bodies in their utter silence, singing the praise of God.
('55', 225, 1, 11, 424635) Let him, who has eyes to see, watch the ever changing patterns of this eternal dance.
('55', 225, 1, 12, 424721) Let him, who has ears to hear, listen to the silent music of these countless gandharvas.
('55', 225, 1, 13, 424810) Let us now try to learn something about these stars, or rather let me share with all co workers what little knowledge I have picked up.
('55', 225, 1, 14, 424946) The better method, of course, would be to learn something about the earth before proceeding to observation of the stars.
('55', 225, 1, 15, 425067) It is quite likely that the boys and girls in the Ashram who have had the benefit of Kakasahebs company already know the facts which I am going to describe.
('55', 225, 1, 16, 425224) I should be happy if that is so.
('55', 225, 1, 17, 425257) I am writing this for all inmates of the Ashram, children and grown ups, old and new.
('55', 225, 1, 18, 425343) Those to whom the subject is interesting will find the study quite easy.
('55', 225, 1, 19, 425416) The right time for the study of the sky is immediately after prayer.
('55', 225, 1, 20, 425485) We need not give it more than twenty minutes at a time.
('55', 225, 1, 21, 425541) Those who understand the true meaning of this study will regard it as a part of the prayer.
('55', 225, 1, 22, 425633) Those of the inmates who sleep in the open may spend as much time as they wish, when they are alone, in watching the stars.
('55', 225, 1, 23, 425757) As they become absorbed in the scene, they will soon fall asleep.
('55', 225, 1, 24, 425823) If they wake up during the night, they may spend some more time in looking at the sky.
('55', 225, 1, 25, 425910) Since the sky seems to be moving all the time, the scene keeps changing from second to second.
('55', 225, 1, 26, 426005) If we look at the sky at 8 p.m.
('55', 225, 1, 27, 426037) in the west, we shall see a grand figure.
('55', 226, 0, 1, 426079) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 227
('55', 226, 3, 2, 426125) S. This figure will be in the west.
('55', 226, 3, 3, 426161) I see it directly opposite me as I lie on my back with my head in the east.
('55', 226, 3, 4, 426237) No one who sees the figure from this position will ever forget it afterwards.
('55', 226, 3, 5, 426315) Since this is the bright half of the month, this and other constellations shine with a rather pale light, but even then this particular constellation is so bright that even a novice like me can spot it easily.
('55', 226, 3, 6, 426525) I shall refer next time to the beliefs which people formerly held about this group both in our country and in the West.
('55', 226, 3, 7, 426645) Just now, I shall only tell you that from the description of the position of this constellation in the Vedas, Tilak Maharaj was able to ascertain the date of the Vedas.
('55', 226, 3, 8, 426814) We have in the Ashram library, a copy of the treatise by the late Shri Dikshit which gives plenty of information on this subject.
('55', 226, 3, 9, 426944) My job is only to arouse interest in this direction.
('55', 226, 3, 10, 426997) Once that is done, I myself shall learn more about the subject from the inmates of the Ashram.
('55', 226, 3, 11, 427092) For m e, these constellations have become a means of communion with God.
('55', 226, 3, 12, 427165) May they be so for the inmates of the Ashram too.
('55', 226, 3, 13, 427215) Live as you like, But realize Hari somehow, anyhow.

('55', 226, 6, 17, 427385) April 11,1932
('55', 226, 7, 18, 427399) NARANDAS, I got your letter.
('55', 226, 7, 19, 427428) I am certainly happy that nobody comes to see me.
('55', 226, 7, 20, 427478) My chief reason is that such visits mean unnecessary expenditure.
('55', 226, 7, 21, 427544) It makes no difference who spends the money.
('55', 226, 7, 22, 427589) When a visit cannot be avoided, of course we dont mind.
('55', 226, 7, 23, 427645) In such circumstances we may go even to Ceylon.
('55', 226, 7, 24, 427693) Having said this, let me add that those to whom this view does not appeal need not act on it.
('55', 226, 7, 25, 427787) I certainly cannot measure the strength of feelings of those who are outside.

('55', 227, 1, 2, 427907) I am sure Tilakam will not go to Malabar.
('55', 227, 1, 3, 427949) He will have to be sent somewhere else.
('55', 227, 1, 4, 427989) If we can send him to Bombay, the arrangement is worth trying.
('55', 227, 1, 5, 428052) Sometimes it happens that Bombay suits persons whom Ahmedabad does not suit.
('55', 227, 1, 6, 428129) The air in Bombay is certainly like what it is in Malabar.
('55', 227, 1, 7, 428188) We know that it suited Jamna.
('55', 227, 1, 8, 428218) Write to Manilal (Revashankerbhais) and ask his view, or to Damodardas, if you approve of my suggestion.
('55', 227, 1, 9, 428323) I hope Manu has completely recovered now.
('55', 227, 1, 10, 428365) If Amtul doesnt have enough money, I think we should provide her the fare and other expenses.
('55', 227, 1, 11, 428459) I understand what you say about the Vidyapith library.
('55', 227, 1, 12, 428514) Do only what seems best to all of you.
('55', 227, 1, 13, 428553) It is now two months since I gave up milk.
('55', 227, 1, 14, 428596) I have observed no ill effects of the step.
('55', 227, 1, 15, 428640) The weight is maintained, more or less.
('55', 227, 1, 16, 428680) The strength also has remained unaffected.
('55', 227, 1, 17, 428723) I am, therefore, continuing the experiment.
('55', 227, 1, 18, 428767) As I have explained in a previous letter, I am gradually coming to the conclusion that people who do not lead a very strenuous life and who can sleep and rest regularly, can do without milk.
('55', 227, 1, 19, 428958) In other words, milk is necessary only for a life of rajasik activities.
('55', 227, 1, 20, 429031) I do realize Hariyomals worth.
('55', 227, 1, 21, 429062) See that he does not ruin his health through his obstinacy.
('55', 227, 1, 22, 429122) All of us know what Krishnamaiyadevi is, but we should tolerate her faults as we do the faults of a member of our family, should indeed go a little further than we would in the case of our own family members.
('55', 227, 1, 23, 429331) When you feel that the limit is reached, you may stop sending money.
('55', 227, 1, 24, 429400) I cannot say anything more than this from here.
('55', 227, 1, 25, 429448) You may give the permission asked for, for translating Anasaktiyoga into Malayalam.
('55', 227, 1, 26, 429532) I gather from your letter that Harihar Sharma is not in the Ashram at present.
('55', 227, 1, 27, 429611) My impression is that he is with Rajagopalachari.
('55', 227, 1, 28, 429661) What you say about Mathuradas is correct.
('55', 227, 1, 29, 429703) I have not received Jethalals report from Anantpur.
('55', 227, 1, 30, 429755) Nor have I had any letter from him.
('55', 227, 1, 31, 429791) If Harilal comes to the Ashram, I think he should be permitted to stay there only on condition that now he gives up drinking.
('55', 227, 1, 32, 429917) You should now consider how long Padma may stay on in Almora.
('55', 227, 1, 33, 429979) Ascertain her own view and also that of Sitla Sahais in the matter.

('55', 228, 1, 2, 430093) I think I have discussed sufficiently often in the past how people should act if a tiger makes its appearance in the Ashram.
('55', 228, 1, 3, 430218) Let them follow what they remember and what they have imbibed in their lives from all that I have said.
('55', 228, 1, 4, 430322) I have sent from here directly, through Chintamani Shastri, a letter of condolence about [the death of] Vishnu Kane of Sasvane.
('55', 228, 1, 5, 430450) Censor all letters.
('55', 228, 1, 6, 430470) Raojibhais letter should not have been passed.
('55', 228, 1, 7, 430517) I know that this will increase the burden on you.
('55', 228, 1, 8, 430567) But it is necessary [to do what I have suggested] in order to satisfy that by which we are always guided.

('55', 228, 5, 13, 430841) April 12, 1932
('55', 228, 6, 14, 430856) BHAISHRI HIRALAL, I got your books and your letter full of love.
('55', 228, 6, 15, 430921) I got them late by a week because Dahyabhai had forgotten to send them immediately.
('55', 228, 6, 16, 431005) The books will be useful to me, and your letter and notes will enhance their usefulness.
('55', 228, 6, 17, 431094) But I am not as ambitious as you seem to think I am.
('55', 228, 6, 18, 431147) I only wish to acquire sufficient general knowledge to be able to see God in the heavens more clearly.
('55', 228, 6, 19, 431250) Please send me a small book on astronomy which you think will suit my purpose.
('55', 228, 6, 20, 431329) I will take proper care of your books.
('55', 228, 6, 21, 431368) I have observed the care with which you have used them.
('55', 228, 6, 22, 431424) Generally I hesitate to borrow such books from friends for fear that they may be lost or damaged.
('55', 228, 6, 23, 431522) I cannot praise your industry and your neatness too much.
('55', 228, 6, 24, 431580) But dont you think that your claim to have discovered a master key may be a little exaggerated?
('55', 228, 6, 25, 431676) 2 What is that key?
('55', 228, 6, 26, 431696) Do you have convincing
('55', 228, 7, 27, 431719) 1Vide the preceding item.
('55', 228, 7, 28, 431745) 2 In The Diary of Mahadev Desai, Vol. I, Mahadev Desai explains: Hiralal Shah wrote to Bapu that he had found the master key of interpretation in certain subjects.
('55', 229, 0, 1, 431909) 230 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 229, 1, 2, 431951) reasons for believing that it is a key, and a master key at that?
('55', 229, 1, 3, 432017) Are those reasons accepted as convincing by experts?
('55', 229, 1, 4, 432070) What benefits do you promise from your discovery?
('55', 229, 1, 5, 432120) May it not be that there is the same drawback here as in the case of the spinning wheel,namely, that there is no master key at all?
('55', 229, 1, 6, 432252) I am certainly ready to be convinced by you and will weigh your arguments objectively.
('55', 229, 1, 7, 432339) But I should like you to cultivate the humility which would befit a dedicated seeker after truth.I know that it cannot be cultivated consciously.
('55', 229, 1, 8, 432485) But it lies behind every genuine discovery.
('55', 229, 1, 9, 432529) The man who has discovered some new truth remains doubtful about his discovery inspite of the immense evidence he may have in favour of his hypothesis.
('55', 229, 1, 10, 432681) The result is that, when ultimately he does put his discovery before the world, he has realized its truth with absolute conviction.
('55', 229, 1, 11, 432813) The people are astounded and believe him.
('55', 229, 1, 12, 432855) There is authority, there is irresistible power, in his words.
('55', 229, 1, 13, 432918) The world is immediately convinced by them.
('55', 229, 1, 14, 432962) It is simply awed by the proofs he adduces in support of his hypothesis, for he has examined it from every possible point of view.
('55', 229, 1, 15, 433093) If this is so about your discovery too, I should have nothing to say in the matter.
('55', 229, 1, 16, 433177) In that case, all honour to you.
('55', 229, 1, 17, 433210) It is my wish that it may be so.
('55', 229, 1, 18, 433243) All of us, that is, all three, are quite well.
('55', 229, 1, 19, 433290) Please tell Shankar on my behalf that he should not endanger his health, and ask him to write to me.

('55', 229, 6, 24, 433506) NARANDAS, I got your letter.
('55', 229, 6, 25, 433535) I have noted that the batch of visitors will arrive here on Thursday.
('55', 229, 6, 26, 433605) Send a cable to America and explain that as a matter of policy the Ashram does not claim exclusive rights [in its publications] or grant them to others.
('55', 229, 6, 27, 433758) Ask them to write and give details, so that we may think carefully about the request.
('55', 229, 7, 28, 433844) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] It was indeed a deliverance for poor Mani.
('55', 229, 7, 29, 433913) I felt happy on reading the news.

('55', 230, 5, 7, 434253) SHANTI, I got your second letter.
('55', 230, 5, 8, 434287) Whatever you do, do it patiently.
('55', 230, 5, 9, 434321) It would be good if you educate your wife a little.
('55', 230, 5, 10, 434373) I expect that Manilal will come in May.
('55', 230, 5, 11, 434413) He has taken more time than he had thought he would require in winding up his affairs.
('55', 230, 5, 12, 434500) Be careful in your expenses.
('55', 230, 5, 13, 434529) You should either educate your wife yourself or take Jamnadass advice for making some other arrangement for her education.

('55', 230, 9, 17, 434753) April 12, 1932
('55', 230, 10, 18, 434768) BHAISHRI KHAMBHATTA, I got your letter just when I had been thinking of you and wondering why there was no letter from you.
('55', 230, 10, 19, 434892) I gather from it that your health is all right.
('55', 230, 10, 20, 434940) I did get in course of time the letter which you wrote to me from England, and I have the impression that I also replied to it.
('55', 230, 10, 21, 435068) I am not aware that I always keep my hand under the head when sleeping.
('55', 230, 10, 22, 435140) It is possible that the hand got under the head sometimes.
('55', 230, 10, 23, 435199) I was careful in the matter after I got your letter and remained vigilant.
('55', 230, 10, 24, 435274) I can say, therefore, that I have never kept the hand in that position since then.
('55', 230, 10, 25, 435357) However, that seems to have had no effect on the condition of the hand.
('55', 230, 10, 26, 435429) No one has yet been able to make out the cause of this weakness.
('55', 230, 10, 27, 435494) As a precaution I even gave up writing with the right hand.
('55', 230, 10, 28, 435554) But afterwards the doctors also came to the conclusion that the pain was not caused by writers cramp.
('55', 230, 10, 29, 435656) If your massaging the hand is likely to cure the pain, I can certainly secure the necessary permission.
('55', 230, 10, 30, 435760) However, if you explain to me the exact manner of doing
('55', 231, 0, 1, 435816) 232 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 231, 1, 2, 435858) the massage, I would do it myself or ask Mahadev to do it.
('55', 231, 1, 3, 435917) But the fact is that the condition is not worth worrying about at all.
('55', 231, 1, 4, 435988) Nor is the pain continuous.
('55', 231, 1, 5, 436016) It occurs only when I use the hand to do certain things.
('55', 231, 1, 6, 436073) The surgeon here was of the opinion that the pain was a sign of old age and that, therefore, no cure was possible.
('55', 231, 1, 7, 436188) Certain weaknesses generally appear in old age, since we do not exercise sufficient self control in our earlier life.
('55', 231, 1, 8, 436306) This weakness may be one such, and there is no reason for sorrow or wonder if it is so.
('55', 231, 1, 9, 436394) Hence, apart from taking necessary precautions, I do not worry about the matter.
('55', 231, 1, 10, 436475) We have now a new doctor here, who believes that the pain can be cured.
('55', 231, 1, 11, 436547) Let me see what he can do.
('55', 231, 1, 12, 436574) I hope both of you enjoy peace of mind.
('55', 231, 1, 13, 436614) We three are happy.
('55', 231, 1, 14, 436634) You must of course have met Andrews.

('55', 231, 5, 18, 436809) April 13, 1932
('55', 231, 6, 19, 436824) DEAR MAJOR MARTIN, It was on the 6th of March that I wrote to Major Bhandari 1 about interviews with non political associates.
('55', 231, 6, 20, 436951) I sent a reminder 2 on the 30th March, but I am still without a reply.
('55', 231, 6, 21, 437022) It is high time that I got a reply about the illustrative list I have already submitted.
('55', 231, 6, 22, 437111) It causes me much inconvenience and some anxiety not to be able to see some of the friends I should like to see and who would like to see me.
('55', 231, 6, 23, 437253) The Government have been good enough to appreciate my desire to write to my prison associates about their welfare.
('55', 231, 6, 24, 437368) In virtue of the permission, I have been writing to some of them, but from Belgaum I can get no answer.
('55', 231, 6, 25, 437472) I have written to Shrimati Manibehn Patel.
('55', 231, 6, 26, 437515) She is Sardar Vallabhbhai Patels daughter, but she has been under the Ashram discipline for over ten years.
('55', 231, 6, 27, 437623) I knew from the letter that was received some time ago by her father that she had been

('55', 232, 1, 2, 437843) ailing.
('55', 232, 1, 3, 437851) I therefore wrote to her asking her to tell me all about her health, but I can get no answer.
('55', 232, 1, 4, 437945) Then there is Kaka Kalelkar whom you know well and who as you are aware has suffered from tuberculosis and requires special care.
('55', 232, 1, 5, 438075) I have written to him also and can get no reply.
('55', 232, 1, 6, 438124) The third is Prabhudas Gandhi 3 a nearly relatedcousin of mine, brought up under me as an infant whilst I was in South Africa.
('55', 232, 1, 7, 438251) He is suffering from the same disease as Kaka Kalelkar and has been under special treatment.
('55', 232, 1, 8, 438344) And there is Sjt.
('55', 232, 1, 9, 438362) Narahari Parikh, a member of the Ashram, an old associate.
('55', 232, 1, 10, 438421) He is also in the Belgaum prison.
('55', 232, 1, 11, 438455) I inquired about these last two of Kakasaheb Kalelkar, but can get no information.
('55', 232, 1, 12, 438538) Will you please get the necessary information about their health and diet and weight?
('55', 232, 1, 13, 438624) Absence of any news about them is a cause of considerable anxiety to me.
('55', 232, 1, 14, 438697) I shall be obliged if you will kindly ascertain for me whether the telegram 1 I handed to Major Bhandari addressed to Allahabad making inquiries about the injuries sustained by Mrs. Motilal Nehru and illness of her son in law Sjt.
('55', 232, 1, 15, 438928) Ranjit Pandit was duly sent.
('55', 232, 1, 16, 438957) I may mention that my relations with the Nehrus are more private and intimate than political, and naturally I am deeply interested in the health and general welfare of the members of the Nehru family.

('55', 232, 6, 21, 439286) MY DEAR CHILD, I am always glad when I hear from you.
('55', 232, 6, 22, 439340) Your letter is interesting and revealing.
('55', 232, 6, 23, 439382) You are still fretting somewhat.
('55', 232, 6, 24, 439415) That you should get over.
('55', 232, 6, 25, 439441) If we have trust in God, we should not worry even as we would not when we have a trustworthy doorkeeper or guard.
('55', 232, 6, 26, 439555) And who can be a better doorkeeper or guard than God the never failing.
('55', 232, 6, 27, 439627) It is not enough that we sing about such things or have a mere intellectual grasp.
('55', 232, 6, 28, 439710) It is necessary to feel the thing within.
('55', 232, 6, 29, 439752) Feeling is exactly like feeling pain or pleasure.

('55', 233, 3, 11, 440380) April 15, 1932
('55', 233, 4, 12, 440395) BHAI, I thought at length over your problem, considered it at night too and we three discussed it together.
('55', 233, 4, 13, 440503) The conclusion, in our firm opinion, is that your conception of dharma is in fact adharma.
('55', 233, 4, 14, 440594) During satyagraha, no satyagrahi can take any vow at all connected with it without obtaining the sanction of the President.
('55', 233, 4, 15, 440718) Your interpretation of your vow is a gross distortion.
('55', 233, 4, 16, 440773) The vow of madhukari has no place in the jail.
('55', 233, 4, 17, 440820) You have no right at present to judge whether or not you will have any sense of shame in going out for madukari after the release.
('55', 233, 4, 18, 440951) To envisage now the state of your mind upon leaving the jail would be to claim the role of God Almighty.
('55', 233, 4, 19, 441056) All three of us hold that your duty lies in accepting the food provided for C class prisoners in the spirit of an offering to God.
('55', 233, 4, 20, 441187) The duty of a sannyasi indicates the same.
('55', 233, 4, 21, 441230) Now, as regards clothes, the insistence upon wearing khadi only while in jail is in no way proper.
('55', 233, 4, 22, 441329) In this matter the duty of every satyagrahi prisoner is to refrain from insisting on wearing khadi until the Congress takes a decision in this.
('55', 233, 4, 23, 441473) This does not in any way affect your vow of self sufficiency.
('55', 233, 4, 24, 441535) I appeal to you to give up the fast, acknowledge your mistake and start eating.
('55', 233, 4, 25, 441615) It would be beneficial to remain on milk or fruit for a day or two because of the fast.
('55', 233, 4, 26, 441703) I am writing this from the medical point of view only.

('55', 233, 5, 29, 441822) Mahadev Desai explains: The addressee was under a vow of self sufficiency in cloth, so that he wore only clothes spun by himself, and secondly he had vowed to live on food obtained by madhukari (begging from a number of houses), and if that was not available, on milk and fruit.

('55', 235, 3, 4, 443426) MY DEAR, If almond paste agrees with you, by all means take it.
('55', 235, 3, 5, 443490) But you must give a fair trial to cod liver oil.
('55', 235, 3, 6, 443539) I have heard that it has a nasty taste, but you must cover the taste or take it as we take water without bringing the cup to the lips, so that it goes down the throat without touching the palate.

('55', 235, 8, 10, 443817) SHARDA, To ensure our spiritual welfare, we should scrupulously follow truth.
('55', 235, 8, 11, 443895) Since we are caught in the workings of Nature, we cannot escape her effects.
('55', 235, 8, 12, 443972) It is our duty to fight against evil effects.
('55', 235, 8, 13, 444018) I dont think there is any truth in the belief that the direction in which we keep our head when sleeping has an effect on us.
('55', 235, 8, 14, 444144) During the National Week, I spun twice as much as at other times.
('55', 235, 8, 15, 444210) Mahadev also spun for yajna during the Week twice as much as he does normally.
('55', 235, 8, 16, 444289) And, of course, we also fasted.
('55', 235, 8, 17, 444321) All of you did much more than that.
('55', 235, 8, 18, 444357) God ceaselessly employs satyagraha against us, for He does not tolerate untruth in us even for an instant.
('55', 235, 8, 19, 444464) God means Truth.
('55', 235, 8, 20, 444481) His satyagraha, therefore, cannot but be perfect.
('55', 235, 8, 21, 444531) Is not this clear?

('55', 236, 2, 5, 444841) Those who have been suppressed by society should courageously break their bonds.
('55', 236, 2, 6, 444922) This is the purpose for which the Ashram exists.
('55', 236, 2, 7, 444971) I wish that the women should understand this clearly and avail themselves of the opportunity [which they have got].

('55', 236, 6, 16, 445669) Do write her reminiscences.
('55', 236, 6, 17, 445697) You should all cultivate her virtues in yourselves.
('55', 236, 6, 18, 445749) If you do that, she will be still alive.
('55', 236, 6, 19, 445790) Truly speaking, however, the soul never dies.
('55', 236, 6, 20, 445836) The bodywhich the soul inhabits perishes.

('55', 237, 3, 7, 446250) All of you have seen her mouth.
('55', 237, 3, 8, 446282) When you walk towards the source, you should also observe the things which you come across on the banks.
('55', 237, 3, 9, 446387) We do not spin for money.
('55', 237, 3, 10, 446413) We should spin, and with careful attention, because spinning is the only work which millions can do.
('55', 237, 3, 11, 446514) As we spin, one of us will be able to invent a really good spinning wheel.

('55', 237, 8, 20, 446982) I will call you Desai after you have invented a prize winning spinning wheel.
('55', 237, 8, 21, 447060) The first Desais were called so in virtue of the posts which they held.
('55', 237, 8, 22, 447132) How good it would be if you also become a Desai by rendering some great service!
('55', 237, 8, 23, 447213) There is no fun for a son to be called a Desai because his father was called that.
('55', 237, 8, 24, 447296) Would it not be better to cling to the name given to one in childhood?

('55', 238, 1, 3, 447571) PRITHURAJ, I am addressing this letter c/o the Ashram, as you have not mentioned your address.
('55', 238, 1, 4, 447666) In your excellent letter you say nothing about the hand.
('55', 238, 1, 5, 447723) It is not true that the same person cannot be self reliant and also owe something to his parents.
('55', 238, 1, 6, 447821) Just as one inherits certain physical qualities from ones parents, so also one may inherit from them wealth and prestige too, It would be false pride to reject them.
('55', 238, 1, 7, 447987) A good sons duty is to make good use of them and add to them.
('55', 238, 1, 8, 448049) In this way, one should see that ones own efforts carry forward what the parents had achieved.
('55', 238, 1, 9, 448144) We should listen to everybodys advice, but do only what our conscience tells us.
('55', 238, 1, 10, 448225) And in order that our conscience may speak, we should observe the yama niyamas 1. Everybody cannot hear the inner voice.
('55', 238, 1, 11, 448346) We need divine ears to hear it.
('55', 238, 1, 12, 448378) Your handwriting shows considerable improvement, but it has not yet become sufficiently well formed.

('55', 239, 8, 13, 449732) April 18, 1932
('55', 239, 9, 14, 449747) There are many fanciful stories about the cluster of stars of which I drew a figure last time.
('55', 239, 9, 15, 449842) 2 No figure of this cluster shows all the stars in it.
('55', 239, 9, 16, 449897) Actually, there are many more stars than you will see in any such figure.
('55', 239, 9, 17, 449971) Hence the best thing is for everybody to make his or her own drawing and show by dots as many stars as can be seen with the naked eye.
('55', 239, 9, 18, 450106) If we follow this practice, we shall learn to recognize the different constellations much more quickly.
('55', 239, 9, 19, 450210) Moreover, the drawings which we ourselves make will be much better for our purpose than those we find in books, for, when the stars are observed from different places there are bound to be differences in the drawings which represent them.
('55', 239, 9, 20, 450449) It would be advisable for everybody to observe the stars from a fixed place and at a fixed time.
('55', 239, 9, 21, 450546) This suggestion is meant for those who wish to make drawings or who are beginners.
('55', 239, 9, 22, 450629) After we have become familiar with the different constellations, we shall be able to recognize these heavenly friends of ours, or these divinities, from wherever we observe them.
('55', 239, 9, 23, 450808) The Hindu, a daily of Madras, publishes a weekly, as does The Times of Bombay.

('55', 240, 1, 2, 451101) constellations visible during each month.
('55', 240, 1, 3, 451143) The Hindu gives such a map in its issue of the first week and The Times gives it in its issue of the second week.
('55', 240, 1, 4, 451257) If you can get either of these maps, you will learn much from it.
('55', 240, 1, 5, 451323) The hundredth number of Kumar is due to be published.
('55', 240, 1, 6, 451377) Shri Hiralal Shah has contributed some articles on this subject for that number.
('55', 240, 1, 7, 451458) He seems to have made a deep study of the subject.
('55', 240, 1, 8, 451509) Everybody who is curious may read those articles.
('55', 240, 1, 9, 451559) Having read those articles, I dont feel inclined to write much here.
('55', 240, 1, 10, 451628) I will only explain a little more clearly my point of view in studying the sky.
('55', 240, 1, 11, 451708) If I attempt more, I shall not be able to write on other subjects along with my weekly letters.
('55', 240, 1, 12, 451804) I may, however, write something occasionally, or in reply to somebodys question.
('55', 240, 1, 13, 451885) The constellation of which I drew a figure is known among us as Mriga or Mrigashirsha.
('55', 240, 1, 14, 451972) One of the months got its name, MargashirshaMagsharfrom this.
('55', 240, 1, 15, 452034) The months in our calendar got their names from the respective constellations.
('55', 240, 1, 16, 452113) In the West, the Mriga is known as Orion.
('55', 240, 1, 17, 452155) The constellation is imagined to be a hunter.
('55', 240, 1, 18, 452201) To its east, there are two very bright stars in a straight line.
('55', 240, 1, 19, 452266) They are imagined to be the hunters dogs.
('55', 240, 1, 20, 452308) The star in the west is the bigger dog and the one to the north is the smaller dog.
('55', 240, 1, 21, 452392) The cluster of stars which we see to its east and south, below the star which forms the fourth angle of the figure, is imagined to be a hare.
('55', 240, 1, 22, 452534) The dogs are running towards it.
('55', 240, 1, 23, 452567) The three stars in the middle are the jewels in the hunters waist band.
('55', 240, 1, 24, 452639) Those stars have also been shown as representing the following figures: The bigger of the two dogs is called Lubdhak among us, and those three stars represent the deers stomach.
('55', 240, 1, 25, 452817) The stars to the south represent the arrow shot by Lubdhak.
('55', 240, 1, 26, 452877) The three stars to the north outside the rectangle represent the deers head.
('55', 240, 1, 27, 452954) These may be beautiful fancies.
('55', 240, 1, 28, 452986) A great deal has been written about their origin, but personally I have read very little of all this.
('55', 240, 1, 29, 453088) There is, of course, no such figure in the sky.
('55', 240, 1, 30, 453136) Nor are the stars as near to us as they seem.
('55', 240, 1, 31, 453182) They are not what they look, but are suns far bigger than our sun.
('55', 240, 1, 32, 453249) Being millions and millions of miles away from us, they twinkle in the sky as mere points.
('55', 240, 1, 33, 453340) Our knowledge about these suns is very little.
('55', 240, 1, 34, 453387) But these dusters of stars serve the most illiterate as their friends.
('55', 240, 1, 35, 453458) If one looks at them even for a second, one would forget all ones misery and burst forth into praise of Gods supreme greatness.
('55', 240, 1, 36, 453586) One would realize that the stars were Gods
('55', 241, 0, 1, 453629) 242 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 241, 1, 2, 453671) messengers and kept watch and guarded us every night and consoled us in our suffering.
('55', 241, 1, 3, 453758) This is the real truth.
('55', 241, 1, 4, 453782) That they are suns and that they are very far from us are mere intellectual conceptions.
('55', 241, 1, 5, 453871) Their service to us in filling us with an awareness of God is the real truth for us.
('55', 241, 1, 6, 453956) From a scientific point of view, we may know a good many properties of water, but may not make any use of our knowledge.
('55', 241, 1, 7, 454077) The knowledge that it is something with which we can quench our thirst and keep our bodies clean, and its use for such purposes, are very important for us and this knowledge of the utility of water is for us the truth about it, even if, in real fact, it is a substance with other properties and uses too.
('55', 241, 1, 8, 454382) And the same is true about the stars.
('55', 241, 1, 9, 454420) They serve us in many ways.
('55', 241, 1, 10, 454448) I have drawn attention to what seems to me their chief function and suggested that one should fix ones mind on that and benefit from their message.
('55', 241, 1, 11, 454596) This is what people seem to have always done from the oldest times.
('55', 241, 1, 12, 454664) In the course of time, however, all kindsof other stories spread and the various myths concerning the stars arose.
('55', 241, 1, 13, 454779) We may certainly read all this in order to make the study more interesting, but we should not lose sight of the primary benefit which I have suggested.
('55', 241, 1, 14, 454931) Let us now turn our attention to two other groups to the north of Mriga.
('55', 241, 1, 15, 455004) The bigger group is known as the Saptarshi 1, and the smaller one is called Dhruvamatsya 2. I have shown seven stars in each group, but there are many more in the Saptarshi.
('55', 241, 1, 16, 455178) They are shown in the drawings which appear in The Times and The Hindu weeklies.
('55', 241, 1, 17, 455259) In Dhruvamatsya we shall not see more.
('55', 241, 1, 18, 455298) It being the bright half of the month just now, we can see only three, two members of the rectangle and the one at the end of the tail, which is called Dhruva 3. This is the only star which remains practically fixed and that is why it was a great help to sailors in old days.
('55', 241, 1, 19, 455574) Both these groups seem to revolve round Dhruva.
('55', 241, 1, 20, 455622) Here we find it very interesting to watch their motion every night.
('55', 241, 1, 21, 455690) Their positions change continually all through the night.
('55', 241, 1, 22, 455748) If we noted these positions from time to time, we would find that they trace quite a big arch.
('55', 241, 1, 23, 455843) In the West, these two groups are called the Great Bear and the Little Bear respectively.
('55', 241, 1, 24, 455933) In one of the books, I even saw beautiful drawings of them.
('55', 241, 1, 25, 455993) The Great Bear is also known as the

('55', 242, 1, 3, 456189) The Saptarshi serves as a clock during the night.
('55', 242, 1, 4, 456239) After some experience, we can always know the time of the night from the position of the Saptarshi.
('55', 242, 1, 5, 456339) However valuable these benefits and however interesting these names may be, they seem insignificant to me in comparison with the primary benefit.
('55', 242, 1, 6, 456485) We should aspire to be as pure as the sky and as bright as the stars.
('55', 242, 1, 7, 456555) We should pray to God, as the latter seem to be doing in their silence.
('55', 242, 1, 8, 456627) Just as they do not depart from their paths even for a moment, so let us never be remiss in doing what we are expected to do.

('55', 242, 4, 10, 456797) 288. LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI
('55', 242, 5, 11, 456828) April 15/18 1932
('55', 242, 6, 12, 456845) NARANDAS, You must have received my postcard 1 about the cable to be sent to America.
('55', 242, 6, 13, 456931) Bali and others came and saw me.
('55', 242, 6, 14, 456964) I was happy that they came.
('55', 242, 6, 15, 456992) I think henceforth we should not permit Harilal to stay in the Ashram.
('55', 242, 6, 16, 457063) I have written to him directly to tell him that he would not be permitted in future to stay there.
('55', 242, 6, 17, 457162) I have sent the letter through Jamnadas.
('55', 242, 6, 18, 457203) He begs to be allowed to stay at a place for a few days, and spend them in his habitual pleasures.
('55', 242, 6, 19, 457302) And then he goes and seeks shelter elsewhere, using the name of the place which he has left.
('55', 242, 6, 20, 457395) We let him stay in the Ashram so long in the hope that slowly he would change his ways there.
('55', 242, 6, 21, 457489) But on the contrary, he became worse.
('55', 242, 6, 22, 457527) You seem to have celebrated the National Week very well indeed.
('55', 242, 6, 23, 457591) I hope no one will fall ill in consequence of all that strain.
('55', 242, 6, 24, 457654) There is one more point in this connection to which I drew your attention once.
('55', 242, 6, 25, 457734) Let me do so again.
('55', 242, 6, 26, 457754) Instead of overstraining ourselves during this Week and, when it is over, spending a few days in rest and then resuming our old life, I think it would be much better if we utilize the Week to learn to be more vigilant and then keep up afterwards the increase in production which we effect.
('55', 242, 6, 27, 458044) In the language of the Gita, work done in the former manner would be an instance of

('55', 243, 0, 1, 458171) 244 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 243, 1, 2, 458213) demoniac work and work done in the latter manner an instance of God like work or the first rajasik work and the other sattvik work.
('55', 243, 1, 3, 458345) Here we celebrated the Week as I have suggested.
('55', 243, 1, 4, 458394) Mahadev started carding and spun a little more than he had been doing.
('55', 243, 1, 5, 458465) But I doubled the quantity of yarn spun daily and, if my right hand does not fail, I intend to keep up the increase.
('55', 243, 1, 6, 458582) Even if some of the inmates who fall ill in the Ashram stay elsewhere permanently, we should not mind the expense on their account.
('55', 243, 1, 7, 458714) Did we not start the Ashram in Almora for this very purpose?
('55', 243, 1, 8, 458775) Why cannot we start similar institutions at other places too?
('55', 243, 1, 9, 458837) If we do, then whenever we see that the air and water of the Ashram do not suit a person, as in the case of Jamna, he or she can go and live in one of those institutions.
('55', 243, 1, 10, 459008) It will not be very expensive to maintain such institutions, and, moreover, we shall be able to start work in those areas.
('55', 243, 1, 11, 459131) This is what we did in Wardha.
('55', 243, 1, 12, 459162) In the beginning, we sent Ramniklal or somebody else there.
('55', 243, 1, 13, 459222) 1 But we had started the Ashram in Wardha in order to keep it up, and so, when Ramniklal fell ill or found it difficult to work thereI forget what actually happenedwe sent Vinoba.
('55', 243, 1, 14, 459402) We dont have another Vinoba, but I think we can spare one of the workers from the Ashram and carry on the work at the new place.
('55', 243, 1, 15, 459531) If we can find a place on the sea coast, we should prefer it.
('55', 243, 1, 16, 459593) But perhaps this is a long term plan.
('55', 243, 1, 17, 459631) Even then this at any rate we can do immediately: find a suitable place on the sea coast and send some of the inmates there, at the same time making up our minds that if anybody does not improve even after trying two or three such places, he or she may die, but we will not go further than this in providing external help for their illness.
('55', 243, 1, 18, 459972) Whether we do or do not decide just now to fix any such limit, we must help those who keep bad health and who require change of air to get it.
('55', 243, 1, 19, 460115) Our letters in which we have expressed our views about calling Padma back to the Ashram seem to have crossed.
('55', 243, 1, 20, 460225) It seems she, too, wishes to return.
('55', 243, 1, 21, 460262) Ascertain the views of Sitla Sahai and Sarojinidevi and do what is necessary.
('55', 243, 1, 22, 460340) Jamna should either return to Bombay or select one of the places from Bardoli, Sasvane, Chorwad, Porbandar, Veraval, Mangarol, Ghogha and Gopanath.
('55', 243, 1, 23, 460488) I think the fact that Bombay suited Jamna means only that sea air suited her.
('55', 243, 1, 24, 460566) If this inference is incorrect we shall know through experience.
('55', 243, 1, 25, 460631) Any of the places which I think will suit Jamna will, I believe, suit Tilakam too.
('55', 243, 1, 26, 460714) I knew of course from the very beginning
('55', 243, 2, 27, 460755) 1 It was Ramniklal Modi.
('55', 244, 0, 1, 460780) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 245
('55', 244, 1, 2, 460826) that the expense on account of Krishnamaiyadevi, Padma and Radha was beyond the means of the Ashram, but, as we have tolerated many other improper things, my mind tolerates this expense too.
('55', 244, 1, 3, 461017) I do feel ashamed of it, of course.
('55', 244, 1, 4, 461053) I shall await a report from you of the views expressed on the issues raised by the question of lezim 1 exercises and the final decision arrived at.
('55', 244, 1, 5, 461201) The person who exercised his influence on behalf of Chandrakanta has not done her good.
('55', 244, 1, 6, 461289) If there are any important letters from abroad, which you think should be sent to me, make copies of them and send them to me.
('55', 244, 1, 7, 461416) The rest need not be sent.
('55', 244, 1, 8, 461443) If any correspondents have asked for autographs [inform them that] they cannot be sent.
('55', 244, 1, 9, 461531) I have not yet received the bottle containing the preparation of almonds and dates.
('55', 244, 1, 10, 461615) I think I know now how to make it.
('55', 244, 1, 11, 461650) I am informed by the jail authorities that Kaka, Narahari, Prabhudas and Manibehn keep good health.
('55', 244, 1, 12, 461750) I have received no letter from them.
('55', 244, 2, 13, 461787) Silence Day, April 18, 1932
('55', 244, 3, 14, 461815) I got a letter from Mahavir 2 directly.
('55', 244, 3, 15, 461855) I have written to him and told him that he should send a budget of the likely expenditureand fix the last date up to which he will stay.
('55', 244, 3, 16, 461992) I have asked him, in deciding this, to remember that our means are limited.
('55', 244, 3, 17, 462068) It seems that Nimu and the children do not keep good health in Lakhtar.
('55', 244, 3, 18, 462140) I, therefore, think that it will be better if you call them back there.
('55', 244, 3, 19, 462212) It seems the children find the heat at Lakhtar too much.
('55', 244, 3, 20, 462269) Compared to Lakhtar, Sabarmati is certainly cool.
('55', 244, 3, 21, 462319) If they prefer Vijapur, she may go and stay there.
('55', 244, 3, 22, 462370) But even if you feel that she should stay at some place other than the Ashram, I think you will be able to decide finally only after she returns there.
('55', 244, 3, 23, 462522) Like the thumb of the right hand, the elbow of the left hand too pains.
('55', 244, 3, 24, 462594) The doctor, therefore, has advised me to give rest to the left hand.
('55', 244, 3, 25, 462663) I have not felt any pain so far when drawing the thread with the left hand.
('55', 244, 3, 26, 462739) It is other movements which cause the pain.
('55', 244, 3, 27, 462783) As a precaution, however, from yesterday I have started using the right hand to rotate the wheel and the left hand to draw the thread.
('55', 244, 3, 28, 462918) Thus working the wheel with the left hand, I spun 95 rounds yesterday in three and a half hours and 85 rounds today in two and a half hours.
('55', 244, 3, 29, 463059) There is no

('55', 245, 1, 2, 463290) difficulty of a mechanical nature in making the necessary change in the Gandiva wheel for this purpose.
('55', 245, 1, 3, 463394) All that is necessary is to remove the spindle to the other side and fix the wheel on the left hand side.
('55', 245, 1, 4, 463500) What effect this change will have on the [left] hand will be known only after some time.
('55', 245, 1, 5, 463589) I had been spinning 375 rounds every day in the week, and I had wanted to keep that up.
('55', 245, 1, 6, 463677) But I have had to give up my intention for the present.
('55', 245, 1, 7, 463733) If, however, I get used to spinning with the left hand, that will be no small advantage.
('55', 245, 1, 8, 463822) I therefore do not feel unhappy about the rounds spun being so few.
('55', 245, 1, 9, 463890) My purpose in mentioning this is to induce people there who may have sufficient enthusiasm to learn to use their left hand as much as they do the right.
('55', 245, 1, 10, 464043) In Japan, the people are taught from their very childhood to use both the hands equally well.
('55', 245, 1, 11, 464137) This practice will give nearly if not exactly twice as much advantage as we have now.
('55', 245, 1, 12, 464223) If our left hand gives as good service as the right, the latter will get proper rest every day, and if the right hand ever becomes disabled we would be able to do all the work with our left hand.
('55', 245, 1, 13, 464419) This is no small advantage.
('55', 245, 1, 14, 464447) If this suggestion appeals to anybody there, he or she should start using the left hand to do some of the work which we normally do with the right hand.
('55', 245, 1, 15, 464600) The activities which immediately come to my mind in this connection are writing, spinning and eating.
('55', 245, 1, 16, 464702) If, however, we think a little about the matter, we shall be able to think of many things which we normally do with our right hand and which we can, with a little reflection and without much effort, train our left hand to do.
('55', 245, 1, 17, 464928) The stock of cotton with me is about to be exhausted.
('55', 245, 1, 18, 464982) If, therefore, you have some cotton of good quality, please send two pounds of it.

('55', 246, 13, 21, 466252) If we do that, the ignorance of other people also will probably disappear.
('55', 246, 13, 22, 466327) Ignorance means ignorance of ones duty, or disinclination to do ones duty even when one knows what it is.

('55', 247, 8, 13, 467202) If, however, we do not have the strength to lay down our life, we should help even by using violence.
('55', 247, 8, 14, 467304) Such violence does not cease tobe violence.
('55', 247, 8, 15, 467348) It remains an evil.

('55', 248, 5, 7, 468159) April 18, 1932
('55', 248, 6, 8, 468174) PARASRAM, You certainly wrote a fine poem for Vimal.
('55', 248, 6, 9, 468227) After all you are a father and do love him, and it is right that you should.
('55', 248, 6, 10, 468304) I do not believe that he does not take interest in study.
('55', 248, 6, 11, 468362) In a proper atmosphere, children learn spontaneously.
('55', 248, 6, 12, 468416) I have often found that they learn more outside the class room than inside it.
('55', 248, 6, 13, 468495) It is our duty, therefore, to create the school atmosphere even at home so that the children may spontaneously go on learning all the time what they can.
('55', 248, 6, 14, 468649) This is the true Montessori method.
('55', 248, 6, 15, 468685) But this means that all the grown up members should behave as teachers, that is, should have purity of character and should love the children.
('55', 248, 6, 16, 468828) This does not mean that we should close our schools, but it certainly means that we should, as quickly as we can, make the whole atmosphere of the Ashram like that of a school, and that all the grown up men and women should regard themselves as the childrensguardians and make themselves fit to be so.
('55', 248, 6, 17, 469130) If we do this, the children will no longer feel the hours in the class rooms boring.
('55', 248, 6, 18, 469215) You should not include for reading Saket and Anagh just because I have made that suggestion.
('55', 248, 6, 19, 469308) You may do so only if you like the suggestion and feel that some at least in the Ashram will appreciate it.
('55', 248, 6, 20, 469416) 1. You may give the children some work to be done outside the class room.
('55', 248, 6, 21, 469490) 2. When you go for a walk, sometimes being alone may be good for you, sometimes talking and sometimes reading and teaching, depending upon your mood at the time.
('55', 248, 6, 22, 469652) You should follow your inclination.
('55', 248, 6, 23, 469688) 3. All persons who deserve to be looked upon as our parents or gurus are also worthy of being revered as God !

('55', 249, 1, 3, 470037) It is, after all, in human nature that persons who are eager to follow rules will spontaneously be drawn to those who observe them most scrupulously.

('55', 249, 5, 8, 470452) What am I to write about, every week, unless the person writes something?
('55', 249, 5, 9, 470526) If Kusum continues to be ill, she should be forced to take rest.
('55', 249, 5, 10, 470591) I am afraid she will not recoup her health unless she takes rest.
('55', 249, 5, 11, 470657) I also will write to her.
('55', 249, 5, 12, 470683) It is now clear that the Sabarmati climate does not agree with you.
('55', 249, 5, 13, 470751) This means that you should not live in Sabarmati for any length of time.
('55', 249, 5, 14, 470824) You should not feel sorry at this, as it is not the particular plot of land that makes the Ashram.
('55', 249, 5, 15, 470923) Your training in the Ashram will have borne fruit if you observe all its rules wherever you live.
('55', 249, 5, 16, 471021) If you have been scrupulously observing the rules in Bombay, there must havebeen a considerable effect on the environment there.
('55', 249, 5, 17, 471150) I will write some time about the importance of observing the rules.

('55', 249, 10, 23, 471375) I cannot ask you to come here just now.

('55', 250, 1, 3, 471587) I have started the massage in the manner recommended by you.
('55', 250, 1, 4, 471648) It is being done with an oil I have, named Lakshadi oil.
('55', 250, 1, 5, 471705) I will let you know the result.
('55', 250, 1, 6, 471737) I hope Andrewss health is all right.

('55', 250, 11, 19, 472311) NIRMALA, Our spiritual progress will remain illusory till we learn to regard every person as our own brother or sister.
('55', 250, 11, 20, 472431) Why should we feel any difference between relations and others?
('55', 250, 11, 21, 472495) How should people who have no relations behave?
('55', 250, 11, 22, 472543) Or those who have lost theirs through death?
('55', 250, 11, 23, 472588) He who regards all human beings as his relations is never bereft of them, for they are [count] 1less.
('55', 250, 11, 24, 472690) Such relationship is the only true one, and all other relationships are false and transitory.

('55', 251, 8, 10, 473312) PADMA, I dont know who is there in Bhawali at present.
('55', 251, 8, 11, 473367) Nor do I know who are still free.
('55', 251, 8, 12, 473401) You can go to Bhawali only if you have cultivated some contacts there.
('55', 251, 8, 13, 473472) But personally I would also like it if you now returned to the Ashram.
('55', 251, 8, 14, 473543) We should trust to our fate.
('55', 251, 8, 15, 473572) What does Sarojinidevi desire?
('55', 251, 8, 16, 473603) It will also be necessary to know what Sitala Sahay desires.

('55', 251, 13, 23, 473931) PREMA, You were certainly not in a mood to write when you wrote that letter.
('55', 251, 13, 24, 474008) It was as long as your letters usually are, but it seemed to be incoherent.
('55', 251, 13, 25, 474084) Just as one should not eat when one is not hungry or go out for a walk when one does not feel like it, similarly one should not write a letter when one is not in a mood to write one.
('55', 251, 13, 26, 474267) Or, you may say

('55', 252, 1, 2, 474329) merely that you are tired and do not wish to write, and stop there.It is not a good sign that the end of the day finds you irritable rather than cheerful.
('55', 252, 1, 3, 474484) This is no evidence of a spirit of non attachment.
('55', 252, 1, 4, 474535) I advise you, nay urge you, to reduce your responsibilities.
('55', 252, 1, 5, 474596) That will do no harm either to you or to the Ashram.
('55', 252, 1, 6, 474649) Only work which is done with a cheerful mind bears fruit.
('55', 252, 1, 7, 474707) I see the co workers here every fortnight, and this time I had asked Dhurandhar to come with the others.
('55', 252, 1, 8, 474812) He keeps good health.
('55', 252, 1, 9, 474834) He has lost some weight, for he takes the diet prescribed for C class prisoners.
('55', 252, 1, 10, 474915) You will be permitted to visit him now, provided no one has visited him meanwhile.
('55', 252, 1, 11, 474998) I hope you wrote what you did about the questions arising from lezim exercises without giving careful thought to the subject.
('55', 252, 1, 12, 475124) You dont know where the doctrine of art for arts sake leads a person.
('55', 252, 1, 13, 475194) In its name, young men in the West have in this age descended right into hell.
('55', 252, 1, 14, 475273) Perhaps you didnt have a clear idea of what art means when you wrote the letter.
('55', 252, 1, 15, 475354) But, then, you yourself have warned me that there will be no sense or logic in your letter.
('55', 252, 1, 16, 475446) I will not, therefore, dwell further on this subject.
('55', 252, 1, 17, 475500) It is possible that you do not appear hysterical to yourself.
('55', 252, 1, 18, 475562) Kisan may also not see that you are so.
('55', 252, 1, 19, 475602) Or it may be that neither of you has understood the meaning of hysterical.
('55', 252, 1, 20, 475677) Perhaps you have never consulted a dictionary to find out.
('55', 252, 1, 21, 475736) Dont take it for granted that our M.A.s know English.
('55', 252, 1, 22, 475790) Moreover, very few people know the meanings of such technical terms.
('55', 252, 1, 23, 475859) You are a fine specimen of a hysterical woman.
('55', 252, 1, 24, 475906) Being hysterical is not necessarily a defect of character.
('55', 252, 1, 25, 475965) It is desirable, however, to overcome this tendency sooner or later.
('55', 252, 1, 26, 476034) But I will not lead you into a discussion of this subject.
('55', 252, 1, 27, 476093) I dont mind your thinking that you are not hysterical.
('55', 252, 1, 28, 476148) Since you always wish to do what seems right to you, I dont worry about the matter.
('55', 252, 1, 29, 476232) No one striving to follow good ever comes to harm. 1
('55', 252, 2, 30, 476285) Your statement was that it was the special excellence of the Ashram that no one in it who took up some work left it off.
('55', 252, 2, 31, 476406) I would regard that as a certificate.
('55', 252, 2, 32, 476444) Maybe the Ashram does not deserve it today, but we should certainly aspire to deserve it one day.
('55', 252, 2, 33, 476542) I am not unhappy about our failures.
('55', 252, 2, 34, 476579) I am aware of them and, therefore, I am vigilant.
('55', 252, 2, 35, 476629) The fact that we get no time to learn what we had wished to

('55', 253, 0, 1, 476709) 254 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 253, 1, 2, 476751) learn is only evidence of my shortcomings.
('55', 253, 1, 3, 476794) My organizing ability and my ability to teach are limited, and my sense of proportion in regard to time is also limited; nonetheless, if circumstances had not kept me away from the Ashram for much of the time, I would have somehow managed to fulfil most of the programme.
('55', 253, 1, 4, 477066) I say this from experience.
('55', 253, 1, 5, 477094) But we should think about the past only with a view to improving things in future if we can.
('55', 253, 1, 6, 477187) All of you should apply your minds and see if you can organize things and do what I have failed to do.
('55', 253, 1, 7, 477290) Find some time and think over what we had planned to do, what remains undone and how much of it can still be carried out.
('55', 253, 1, 8, 477412) Try to do whatever can be done.
('55', 253, 1, 9, 477444) If you think that nothing can be done, forget what cannot be helped.
('55', 253, 1, 10, 477513) We should not go on worrying about the matter.
('55', 253, 1, 11, 477560) To become a cipher means to shed the feeling, I am doing this.
('55', 253, 1, 12, 477623) There is no suggestion of pessimism in this.
('55', 253, 1, 13, 477668) Mahadev and I may claim to have done twice the normal amount of work during this Week.
('55', 253, 1, 14, 477755) This time, Sardar has not yet been inspired to take up spinning.

('55', 253, 5, 19, 477999) April 18, 1932
('55', 253, 7, 20, 478014) 1. I have never seen any difference between the Jain doctrine and the general Vedic doctrine.
('55', 253, 7, 21, 478108) The difference is only one of point of view.
('55', 253, 7, 22, 478153) The God of the Vedas is both a Doer and a non Doer.
('55', 253, 7, 23, 478205) Since the
('55', 253, 8, 24, 478215) 1 On the 6th and 13th, the first and the last day of the National Week 2 The addressee had put the following questions to Gandhiji: (i) What is the difference between the Gitas theism and the Jain doctrine that there is no God?
('55', 253, 8, 25, 478443) (ii) If action cannot be attributed to God, who bestows grace?
('55', 253, 8, 26, 478506) If a person following the path of devotion does not or cannot believe in Divine grace, what else can sustain his faith?
('55', 253, 8, 27, 478626) Is prayer anything more than an expression of a mans pious wishes?
('55', 253, 8, 28, 478693) (iii) What is the exact meaning of your statement, Truth is God?
('55', 254, 0, 1, 478758) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 255
('55', 254, 1, 2, 478804) whole world is pervaded by God, He is a Doer, and yet He is not that because He remains untouched.
('55', 254, 1, 3, 478903) He does not suffer the consequences of karma, since the world is not His karma in the sense in which we use the word.
('55', 254, 1, 4, 479021) Looked at from this point of view, the verses which you have quoted from the Gita can be reconciled with one another.
('55', 254, 1, 5, 479139) We should remember that the Gita is a poem.
('55', 254, 1, 6, 479183) God does not speak nor does He do anything.
('55', 254, 1, 7, 479227) We cannot say that God said anything to Arjuna.
('55', 254, 1, 8, 479275) The conversation between Lord Krishna and Arjuna is imaginary.
('55', 254, 1, 9, 479338) I at any rate do not believe that such a conversation took place between a real Krishna and a real Arjuna.
('55', 254, 1, 10, 479445) But there is nothing inappropriate or untruthful in the method adopted by the Gita.
('55', 254, 1, 11, 479529) It was a custom in those times to write religious works in such a form, and even today a learned writer would not be criticized for adopting a similar form.
('55', 254, 1, 12, 479686) Jainism stated the truth logically and unpoetically and, therefore, coldly, and said that there was no God who might be describedas Creator of the world.
('55', 254, 1, 13, 479840) It is not wrong to say this, but the ordinary mass of people do not respond to cold logic.
('55', 254, 1, 14, 479931) They always crave for poetry.
('55', 254, 1, 15, 479961) That is why even the rationalism of the Jains felt the need for temples, images and similar aids, for which pure nyaya 1
('55', 254, 2, 16, 480082) should have no use.
('55', 254, 2, 17, 480102) 2. The answer to your second question is contained in the answer to the first, as the question itself, I think, is contained in the first question.
('55', 254, 2, 18, 480250) The word grace is a poetic term.
('55', 254, 2, 19, 480283) Bhakti itself is poetry.
('55', 254, 2, 20, 480308) But poetry is not an unworthy or inferior or superfluous thing.
('55', 254, 2, 21, 480372) It is a very essential factor.
('55', 254, 2, 22, 480403) That water is composed of two parts of hydrogen and one part of oxygen is a factual statement, but to describe water as a gift of God is poetry.
('55', 254, 2, 23, 480548) It is essential for a full life that we should feel in this poetic way, but it is not essential that we should know the scientific truth about the composition of water.
('55', 254, 2, 24, 480717) Similarly, it is perfect logic to say that everything that happens is the effect of karma.
('55', 254, 2, 25, 480808) But the true nature of karma is an unfathomable mystery.
('55', 254, 2, 26, 480865) We mortals are so utterly ignorant that we cannot know all the karmas which are the cause of even the most ordinary event.
('55', 254, 2, 27, 480988) It is, therefore, true to say that everything happens through the grace of God.
('55', 254, 2, 28, 481068) Really speaking, that is the perfect truth.
('55', 254, 2, 29, 481112) Moreover, the atman dwelling in a body is imprisoned in it like the air in a jar, and, as that air cannot use its natural power so long as it believes itself
('55', 254, 3, 30, 481270) 1 Logic; for Gandhijis explanation of his meaning here, vide Letter to Purushottam Gandhi, 12 5 1932.
('55', 255, 0, 1, 481372) 256 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 255, 1, 2, 481414) unconnected with the air outside, so the atman imprisoned in a body remains cut off from the power of omnipotent God so long as it believes itself the doer of things.
('55', 255, 1, 3, 481581) For this reason, too, it is only when we say that everything which happens is done by God that we speak the perfect truth as befits a satyagrahi.
('55', 255, 1, 4, 481727) The desires of a votary of truth are good and, therefore, they are always fulfilled.
('55', 255, 1, 5, 481812) Accordingly, our prayers consisting of the verses which you have quoted 1 are bound to benefit the world also in the measure in which our prayers are sincere.
('55', 255, 1, 6, 481971) The world is not separate from us or we from the world.
('55', 255, 1, 7, 482027) All are connected with one another in their inmost essence and the actions of each have effects on all others.
('55', 255, 1, 8, 482138) Actions here include thoughts also.
('55', 255, 1, 9, 482174) Hence not a single thought is without its effect.
('55', 255, 1, 10, 482224) That is why we must cultivate the habit of thinking good thoughts.
('55', 255, 1, 11, 482291) 3. I was not led to the conclusion that Truth is God by considering that God is formless and so is Truth.
('55', 255, 1, 12, 482397) But I saw that Truth is the only perfect description of God.
('55', 255, 1, 13, 482458) All other descriptions areimperfect.
('55', 255, 1, 14, 482495) Even the word Ishvar 2 is a descriptive term, applied to an omnipotent something which cannot be described by human speech.
('55', 255, 1, 15, 482619) If we think of the etymological meaning of the word Ishvar, the word does not touch our heart.
('55', 255, 1, 16, 482714) Thinking of God as a ruler does not satisfy our mind.
('55', 255, 1, 17, 482768) It may produce a kind of fear in us, which deters us from sin and impels us to be virtuous.
('55', 255, 1, 18, 482860) But virtuous actions inspired by fear cease to be virtuous.
('55', 255, 1, 19, 482920) If we act virtuously, we should do so through love of virtue and not through expectation of any reward.
('55', 255, 1, 20, 483024) These and similar reflections resulted one day in my realizing that the statement that God is Truth is also imperfect.
('55', 255, 1, 21, 483143) The statement that Truth itself is God is a perfect statement as far as human speech can express anything perfectly.
('55', 255, 1, 22, 483260) We shall come to the same conclusion if we consider the etymological meaning of the word satya.
('55', 255, 1, 23, 483356) It is derived from the root sat, which means to exist eternally.
('55', 255, 1, 24, 483421) That which exists eternally is satya, Truth, it can be nothing else.
('55', 255, 1, 25, 483490) But belief in Truth as God should not diminish our faith, on the contrary, it should increase it.
('55', 255, 1, 26, 483588) That at any rate has been my experience.
('55', 255, 1, 27, 483629) By regarding Truth as God, we save ourselves from many a pitfall.
('55', 255, 1, 28, 483695) We no longer desire to see miracles or hear about them.
('55', 255, 1, 29, 483751) We may find difficulty in understanding what seeing God means; there can be no difficulty in understanding the meaning of seeing Truth.
('55', 255, 1, 30, 483887) Seeing Truth may itself be difficult, it

('55', 256, 1, 4, 484332) I will not be tired of answering your questions.
('55', 256, 1, 5, 484381) And I am confident that we shall find a satisfactory answer.
('55', 256, 1, 6, 484442) Maybe this fails to answer all the doubts that may arise in your mind; in that case you may ask me again and again.

('55', 256, 6, 12, 484737) NIMU, I received your letter.
('55', 256, 6, 13, 484767) Ramdas has sent on to me the letter you wrote to him.
('55', 256, 6, 14, 484821) I have written to Narandas and asked him to call you over to the Ashram.
('55', 256, 6, 15, 484894) Probably the children will get all right there.
('55', 256, 6, 16, 484942) Moreover, in the Ashram.
('55', 256, 6, 17, 484967) there are also such experienced women as Lakshmibehn, etc.
('55', 256, 6, 18, 485026) As a general rule, it is best to give no medicine to children.
('55', 256, 6, 19, 485089) If you are careful about what they eat, they will not fall ill.
('55', 256, 6, 20, 485153) If they do not pass stools with ease, you may give them a little quantity of castor oil.
('55', 256, 6, 21, 485242) It will be good if you write to me regularly every week.

('55', 257, 9, 10, 485752) April 19, 1932
('55', 257, 10, 11, 485767) MY DEAR, We are all sons of rishis and there should be no pride of priestly or any other class.
('55', 257, 10, 12, 485863) Priests are servants, voluntarily, of the people, and so are Kshatriyas.
('55', 257, 10, 13, 485936) And to keep up ones vow is the duty not merely of the priest and the warrior but of all mankind.
('55', 257, 10, 14, 486033) Therefore I should have respected your vow taken with deliberation and in a worthy manner without regard to your class.
('55', 257, 10, 15, 486153) But if you will respect your vow [you] must surround it with all the protection it needs, i.e., you must take all the rest that your system requires so that your vow may not be discredited and so that it may not be unduly tried.
('55', 257, 10, 16, 486382) Your decision not to draw anything save for your absolute necessity is quite good.

('55', 258, 1, 2, 486547) 307. LETTER TO SURENDRAJI
('55', 258, 2, 3, 486573) April 19, 1932
('55', 258, 3, 4, 486588) Your letter did not require immediate reply, and I also thought that as a prisoner I should keep myself within proper limits.
('55', 258, 3, 5, 486714) Hence I delayed replying to you.
('55', 258, 3, 6, 486747) I have completely forgotten what you had said in your previous letter (written to me when I was in England).
('55', 258, 3, 7, 486856) You should never hesitate to write to me anything you think about me.
('55', 258, 3, 8, 486926) It would be a weakness in you to feel such hesitation.
('55', 258, 3, 9, 486981) If friends and co workers put before me their criticism whenever they think that I am committing an error, I would learn much from it, because there would be no malice in their criticism.
('55', 258, 3, 10, 487169) Moreover, if we are displeased with anything which a friend may have done, it is a test of our friendship and love for him to tell him immediately what has displeased us.
('55', 258, 3, 11, 487340) Love is not love if it hesitates to speak out through consideration for the feelings of the person loved.
('55', 258, 3, 12, 487446) In the statement, true brahmacharya is that which remains inviolate in any condition 1, the word condition should be understood comprehensively.
('55', 258, 3, 13, 487591) That is true brahmacharya which does not succumb to any temptation or allurement.
('55', 258, 3, 14, 487673) If a beautiful young woman makes advances to the stone image of a man, there will be no effect on the latter.
('55', 258, 3, 15, 487783) A man is a true brahmachari if, in similar circumstances, he remains like a stone.
('55', 258, 3, 16, 487866) And that image neither hears with its ears nor sees with its eyes.
('55', 258, 3, 17, 487933) Similarly, a man also should not go seeking temptations.
('55', 258, 3, 18, 487990) Anybody who does that is not a brahmachari.
('55', 258, 3, 19, 488034) A brahmachari should not knowingly do anything which may be regarded as a sign of lust.
('55', 258, 3, 20, 488122) But your chief contention is this, that the sight and company of women are found in experience to be inimical to self control and must, therefore, be avoided.
('55', 258, 3, 21, 488281) This reasoning seems wrong to me.
('55', 258, 3, 22, 488315) That is not true self control or brahmacharya which can be preserved only by avoiding even such association with women as may occur in the ordinary course and is necessitated by our work of service.
('55', 258, 3, 23, 488514) It is only outward renunciation uninspired by genuine desirelessness.
('55', 258, 3, 24, 488584) The suppressed craving is bound to break through when it gets a suitable opportunity.
('55', 258, 3, 25, 488670) Scripture tells us that our pleasure

('55', 259, 0, 1, 488743) 260 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 259, 1, 2, 488785) in sense objects does not disappear completely till we have had a vision of the Supreme.
('55', 259, 1, 3, 488874) 1 But the converse is equally true.
('55', 259, 1, 4, 488910) Till our pleasure in sense objects has disappeared completely, we cannot see the Supreme.
('55', 259, 1, 5, 489000) In other words, our progress in regard to both is simultaneous.
('55', 259, 1, 6, 489064) The meaning of the last statement should be carefully understood.
('55', 259, 1, 7, 489130) Our pleasure in sense objects does indeed disappear only after we have had a vision of the Supreme.
('55', 259, 1, 8, 489230) That is, though our cravings may have subsided, our instinctive pleasure in sense objects will have survived somewhere deep in us and, therefore, till we have seen the Supreme there will always be a possibility of the cravings being aroused again.
('55', 259, 1, 9, 489478) After the vision of the Supreme, there can be no cravings whatsoever.
('55', 259, 1, 10, 489548) That means that such a man loses the consciousness of sex and becomes sexless.
('55', 259, 1, 11, 489627) That is to say, he ceases to be a figure and becomes a cipher, in other words, loses his self in God.
('55', 259, 1, 12, 489729) When craving has ceased altogether, there can be no pleasure in sense objects.
('55', 259, 1, 13, 489808) I think this is easy enough to understand.
('55', 259, 1, 14, 489851) If in this discussion we substitute the word Truth wherever the words Supreme, God, Brahman, Parabrahman, etc., occur, the argument will be clear and it will also be easy to understand the meaning of realization.
('55', 259, 1, 15, 490064) Self deception will not avail anybody here.
('55', 259, 1, 16, 490108) Those in the Ashram who, under the pretext of living according to the ideal of the Ashram being one family, gratify their lustful fancies mentally are the hypocrites of Chapter III [of the Gita].
('55', 259, 1, 17, 490304) Here we are talking about persons who scrupulously follow Truth and are considering how they should behave.
('55', 259, 1, 18, 490412) Hence, even if ninety nine per cent of the inmates of the Ashram act as above, so long as the remaining one percent sincerely try to live according to our ideal of the Ashram being one family, the aim of the Ashram will have been fulfilled and the manner of life which we have deliberately adopted in it will be justified.
('55', 259, 1, 19, 490735) We need not, therefore, think what others do, but consider only what is possible for ourselves.
('55', 259, 1, 20, 490831) But, at the same time, we should also take care not to imitate others without regard to our own limitations.
('55', 259, 1, 21, 490940) 2 Others may claim that they can live freely according to the ideal of our being one family, but we ourselves, if we feel that we do not have such strength, should avoid physical contact with women inmates without disputing the claim of those others.
('55', 259, 1, 22, 491191) We are carrying on a new and dangerous experiment in the Ashram.

('55', 260, 1, 2, 491407) join it without violating Truth may do so, and those who cannot may keep away from it.
('55', 260, 1, 3, 491494) We do not regard it as everybodys duty to mix freely with the women inmates.
('55', 260, 1, 4, 491571) All that we do is to permit such freedom.
('55', 260, 1, 5, 491613) Those members who can take it without violating dharma may do so, but those who are afraid of violating dharma by such freedom may, even though they live in the Ashram, keep themselves miles away from the company of women.
('55', 260, 1, 6, 491836) One inmate of the Ashram may be able to treat .
('55', 260, 1, 7, 491884) 1 as his daughter.
('55', 260, 1, 8, 491903) But another inmate may not be able to cultivate such a feeling towards her, though he wishes that he could.
('55', 260, 1, 9, 492011) It would then be his duty not to be free with her.
('55', 260, 1, 10, 492062) In this connection I have given the illustration of a corpse.
('55', 260, 1, 11, 492124) If you feel that it is wrong to imagine such a case even as an illustration, you may suppose A and B instead.
('55', 260, 1, 12, 492234) If C cannot feel towards B as A does, it is the moral duty of C, so long as he lives in the Ashram, never to touch B.
('55', 260, 1, 13, 492352) I have tried to enforce this rule in all cases in which I came to know the truth.
('55', 260, 1, 14, 492434) You should forget what happened about the chair.
('55', 260, 1, 15, 492483) No importance need be attached to it.
('55', 260, 1, 16, 492521) You are a sincere seeker, and, therefore, the ultimate result will assuredly be good.
('55', 260, 1, 17, 492607) So long as one has got reason, one is bound to use it.
('55', 260, 1, 18, 492662) It is not at all necessary to smother it.
('55', 260, 1, 19, 492704) You may commit errors, but you will learn through them and some day you will make experiments which will prove beneficial.
('55', 260, 1, 20, 492827) And it is not as if all your experiments suggested by your reason fail.
('55', 260, 1, 21, 492899) What does it matter if five such experiments in a hundred fail?
('55', 260, 1, 22, 492963) All of us have a right to make mistakes.
('55', 260, 1, 23, 493004) Whenever we realize that we have made a mistake, we shall start afresh and go forward.
('55', 260, 1, 24, 493091) I do not remember on what occasion I made it but the statement that a person who observes the vow [of brahmacharya] can render greater service to women is perfectly true.
('55', 260, 1, 25, 493262) And there can be no question that I must have served them better in the measure in which I have succeeded in my effort to observe it.

('55', 261, 2, 3, 493556) YERAVDA MANDIR, April 19, 1932
('55', 261, 3, 4, 493587) SUMANGAL PRAKASH, I have your letter.
('55', 261, 3, 5, 493625) It would have been better if efforts had not been made to have Chandrakanta given A class.
('55', 261, 3, 6, 493716) But what is done is done.
('55', 261, 3, 7, 493742) Now she must give up the facilities of A class or make the very least use of them.
('55', 261, 3, 8, 493825) I do remember that when I was in England I had a letter from you but I never had any time there to spare and I hardly wrote to anyone in this country.
('55', 261, 3, 9, 493976) Even if you wrote about Kanaiyalals death, I have completely forgotten about it.
('55', 261, 3, 10, 494057) What had been the matter with him?
('55', 261, 3, 11, 494092) I also remember about the scheme for the publishing house.
('55', 261, 3, 12, 494151) I do not recollect that I was able to go through it.
('55', 261, 3, 13, 494204) I take it that it is unnecessary now to say anything about it.
('55', 261, 3, 14, 494267) I had not been given the book about Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi.
('55', 261, 3, 15, 494329) You must, if necessary, follow a strict regimen and put your health in order.
('55', 261, 3, 16, 494407) It is now more than two months since I gave up milk.
('55', 261, 3, 17, 494460) I give up milk whenever a pretext presents itself and that is what happened this time.
('55', 261, 3, 18, 494547) This has not done me any harm and so long as no harm comes from it I shall continue to eschew milk.
('55', 261, 3, 19, 494647) In place of milk I take four tolas of roasted almonds ground to a paste.
('55', 261, 3, 20, 494720) In addition to this I take baked bread, dates, lemon and one vegetable a day such as white gourd, brinjal, etc.
('55', 261, 3, 21, 494832) I take sour lemon with soda bi carb.
('55', 261, 3, 22, 494869) In the early morning I have honey in hot water with a little soda.
('55', 261, 3, 23, 494936) That is my diet.
('55', 261, 3, 24, 494953) You are not to copy this.
('55', 261, 3, 25, 494979) You must have chiefly milk, curd and fresh fruit.
('55', 261, 3, 26, 495029) If you still feel hungry you may take greens and chapati or bread, but this is not to be a substitute for milk and fresh fruit.
('55', 261, 3, 27, 495157) It is difficult, if not impossible, to say how long my body will endure.
('55', 261, 3, 28, 495230) Whatever I may say will only be guessing.
('55', 261, 3, 29, 495272) I can not claim that my life has been one of self control from the beginning.
('55', 261, 3, 30, 495350) I have indulged myself in some form or other and so I cannot take from the body as much work as I should like.
('55', 261, 3, 31, 495461) Most of the others, too, are poorin health and, therefore, either do not see my physical weakness or ignore it.
('55', 261, 3, 32, 495573) Be that as it may.
('55', 261, 3, 33, 495592) All that I wish is that the few years that are left to me should be spent in some work or other of service.

('55', 262, 1, 3, 495818) The full span of a mans life is a hundred years.
('55', 262, 1, 4, 495867) For the reasons explained above I do not consider myself fit to reach that age.
('55', 262, 1, 5, 495947) It is good to have the teeth scraped by a machine.

('55', 262, 6, 12, 496208) BHAI SUMANGAL PRAKASH,
('55', 262, 7, 13, 496231) I have your letter.
('55', 262, 7, 14, 496251) Kanta must not be coerced into giving up the facilities she enjoys.
('55', 262, 7, 15, 496319) So long as she does not herself want to give up the privileges, she should not be made to do so.
('55', 262, 7, 16, 496416) To cite my example is right and not right.
('55', 262, 7, 17, 496459) It is right because so long as I am engaged in public work people are bound to take me as a model, which will only create misunderstandings, because what I expect others to practise I cannot for various reasons practise myself.
('55', 262, 7, 18, 496687) So there is a flaw in my leadership.
('55', 262, 7, 19, 496724) Citing my example might not be right because my position is very different from that of others.
('55', 262, 7, 20, 496820) One reason is my physical weakness.
('55', 262, 7, 21, 496856) Another reason is my title of Mahatma.
('55', 262, 7, 22, 496895) A third reason is my special situation.
('55', 262, 7, 23, 496935) In whatever class I may be I have to have special food, because my body and my vow demand it.
('55', 262, 7, 24, 497029) This applies to some extent to all prisoners.
('55', 262, 7, 25, 497075) It is a different matter that every prisoner cannot have this facility as easily as I can.
('55', 262, 7, 26, 497166) I am permitted interviews once every week instead of once every three months.
('55', 262, 7, 27, 497244) As for letters there is almost no restriction.
('55', 262, 7, 28, 497291) I have decided in my mind that I have no intimate friend.
('55', 262, 7, 29, 497349) I meet relatives, not because they are relatives but because my meeting them serves some moral purpose.
('55', 262, 7, 30, 497453) My writing letters also has the same end in view.
('55', 262, 7, 31, 497503) Whether deep down it gives me some kind of pleasure I do not know.
('55', 262, 7, 32, 497570) Thereseems little likelihood because withdrawal of permission to write letters or to see visitors would not upset me.
('55', 262, 7, 33, 497688) In 1930 I refused to avail myself of the facility of interviews because the Government would not
('55', 263, 0, 1, 497785) 264 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 263, 1, 2, 497827) accept my condition.
('55', 263, 1, 3, 497848) In 1922 I had stopped writing letters.
('55', 263, 1, 4, 497887) Lately I have been kept apart from others.
('55', 263, 1, 5, 497930) That also is a reason.
('55', 263, 1, 6, 497953) One should not make comparisons with me on this account, but if this is not obvious I would not like to persuade anyone by arguments.
('55', 263, 1, 7, 498087) There is no doubt a slight difference between one who has got A class after some efforts from outside the jail and one who has been given A class by the jail authorities themselves.
('55', 263, 1, 8, 498269) But it is no use stressing this difference.
('55', 263, 1, 9, 498313) The ideal should certainly be that there should be no classification, and where as a result of classification people have been given better classes they should give up the privileges of those classes.
('55', 263, 1, 10, 498514) Very few are today acting up to this idea.
('55', 263, 1, 11, 498557) Therefore one does not want to bring the least pressure to bear on a delicate girl such as Kanta.
('55', 263, 1, 12, 498655) She is a thoughtful girl and on her own practises such self control as she can.
('55', 263, 1, 13, 498735) Kanaiyalals untimely demise is distressing.
('55', 263, 1, 14, 498779) But instead of losing courage you must be doubly careful.
('55', 263, 1, 15, 498837) The prayer I made on behalf of Manilal was impelled not by wisdom but by a fathers love for his son.
('55', 263, 1, 16, 498938) Only one prayer is proper and that is May God do as He wills. Of course one may ask what meaning this prayer has.
('55', 263, 1, 17, 499052) The answer is that prayer should not be given a gross meaning.
('55', 263, 1, 18, 499115) It means that to free ourselves of attachments we become aware of the God dwelling in our hearts and conceiving Him as separate from us, we pray that we may not be taken where we are impelled by the mind but that we may be taken where God who is our Master takes us.
('55', 263, 1, 19, 499382) Whether our good lies in our dying or in our living we do not know.
('55', 263, 1, 20, 499450) Therefore we should not rejoice in life or tremble at the thought of death.
('55', 263, 1, 21, 499526) We should treat the two as the same and remain untouched.
('55', 263, 1, 22, 499584) This is the ideal and it may take a long time to attain to it.
('55', 263, 1, 23, 499647) Indeed very few can attain to it.
('55', 263, 1, 24, 499681) But this need not discourage us from pursuing it.
('55', 263, 1, 25, 499731) And the more difficulties we face in the pursuit the greater should be our efforts to overcome them.
('55', 263, 1, 26, 499832) If we think over the matter deeply we can conquer the palate.
('55', 263, 1, 27, 499894) We must not accept defeat.
('55', 263, 1, 28, 499921) Mans full span of life is considered to be a hundred years.
('55', 263, 1, 29, 499981) It can be more but however long it may be, time is an unending stream in which a human lifetime is not even a millionth part of a drop.
('55', 263, 1, 30, 500117) What can therefore attachment for it or calculation about it avail?
('55', 263, 1, 31, 500185) And any calculations we may make can never be definite.
('55', 263, 1, 32, 500241) We can only guess and say at the most how long a human life can be.
('55', 263, 1, 33, 500309) For the rest even the healthiest children meet with untimely
('55', 264, 0, 1, 500370) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 265
('55', 264, 1, 2, 500416) deaths.
('55', 264, 1, 3, 500424) We cannot even say that a man given to lustful pleasures will not enjoy a long life.
('55', 264, 1, 4, 500509) The most we can say is that a man who has been free from lust from the very beginning, who leads a simple life, stands a good chance of enjoying a long life span.
('55', 264, 1, 5, 500672) But to seek to conquer pleasures of sense for the sake of a long life is like digging up a mountain for the sake of a mouse.
('55', 264, 1, 6, 500797) We must conquer sensual pleasures for realizing the Self.
('55', 264, 1, 7, 500855) If self control leads to shortening of life rather than to prolonging it we should not care.
('55', 264, 1, 8, 500948) A life free of disease and long in years is the least significant result of self control.
('55', 264, 1, 9, 501038) Being in jail Kanta naturally cannot practise hydrotherapy.
('55', 264, 1, 10, 501098) Therefore the best way for her is to consult the best doctors.
('55', 264, 1, 11, 501161) It is possible that if she restricts herself to a diet of milk, curd and fruit she may have some relief in the matter of her menstrual trouble and her toothache.
('55', 264, 1, 12, 501323) Relief from pyorrhoea may be attained by chewing a datun for half an hour morning and evening and by massaging the gums inside and outside with a finely ground clean mixture of salt and charcoal powder.
('55', 264, 1, 13, 501526) I am not writing separately to Kanta.

('55', 264, 5, 18, 501740) KANTA, At last you are settled.
('55', 264, 5, 19, 501772) Now take full advantage of the solitude.
('55', 264, 5, 20, 501813) Give your friends what you have gained and take from them what is worth accepting from them.
('55', 264, 5, 21, 501906) If it is possible, write to me from there.
('55', 264, 5, 22, 501949) But the number of letters you write will be restricted.
('55', 264, 5, 23, 502005) It will therefore suffice if you write to Brother and he passes on to me what I should know from it.
('55', 264, 5, 24, 502106) Or tell Prabhavati to include in her letter what you wish to say.

('55', 265, 1, 2, 502405) 311. LETTER TO NRISIMHAPRASAD K. BHATT
('55', 265, 2, 3, 502444) April 20, 1932
('55', 265, 3, 4, 502459) My fear has come true.
('55', 265, 3, 5, 502482) You have seen a discrepancy between my advice to you and the fact that I myself toured the country to collect money for the service of the poor.
('55', 265, 3, 6, 502627) I was afraid that you would do so.
('55', 265, 3, 7, 502662) I, however, see no such discrepancy.
('55', 265, 3, 8, 502699) I did not feel any inconsistency with my views in this matter even when I started on my tour.
('55', 265, 3, 9, 502793) The difference between our two cases is this.
('55', 265, 3, 10, 502839) Dakshinamurti is your institution, as the Ashram is mine.
('55', 265, 3, 11, 502897) Your duty towards it is not to go out collecting money for it, but to teach and pour your soul into the pupils.
('55', 265, 3, 12, 503009) Similarly, my duty towards the Ashram is not to collect money for it but to observe its vows and help the other inmates to observe them, and to help in carrying on the various activities of the Ashram with greater vigour.
('55', 265, 3, 13, 503231) I must have faith that, if I do this duty, we shall get the money that we need.
('55', 265, 3, 14, 503311) The principle regarding the collection of a fund for the poor should be the opposite of this.
('55', 265, 3, 15, 503405) In that case my chief aim was to raise a fund.
('55', 265, 3, 16, 503452) You cannot go out to collect money for Dakshinamurti, but friends may certainly approach people for help to your institution.
('55', 265, 3, 17, 503578) It is their duty to do so.
('55', 265, 3, 18, 503605) Do you now see the difference between the two cases?
('55', 265, 3, 19, 503658) And this is not a new kind of difference, nor have I thought of it recently.
('55', 265, 3, 20, 503735) I bore this distinction in mind even in South Africa.
('55', 265, 3, 21, 503789) That is, when I realized it, I stopped seeking help for Phoenix, but I begged from door to door for a public institution there.
('55', 265, 3, 22, 503917) I, therefore, still suggest that you should resolve, if not immediately, as soon as may be, that you will not go out to collect money for the institution.
('55', 265, 3, 23, 504072) You should write toall friends who have been helping the institution and whom you know personally, and inform them of your decision, and then let the events take their own course.
('55', 265, 3, 24, 504252) The argument that our people do not yet appreciate institutions like yours and do not realize that it is their duty to give help to them on their own, is only a half truth.
('55', 265, 3, 25, 504425) We who manage such institutions lack faith in our work, and, therefore, the people have not been rightly educated about their duty of providing funds for them.
('55', 265, 3, 26, 504585) This is a vicious circle.
('55', 265, 3, 27, 504611) The people remain ignorant of their duty because we have not tried to educate them about it; and till they learn to give money on their own, we go begging from door to door.
('55', 265, 3, 28, 504785) Things will never change in this way.
('55', 265, 3, 29, 504823) The people will not learn their
('55', 266, 0, 1, 504855) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 267
('55', 266, 1, 2, 504901) duty and we shall not acquire faith in our work.
('55', 266, 1, 3, 504950) And the result will be that all our labour will be wasted.
('55', 266, 1, 4, 505009) Some of us, therefore, should risk everything and follow the way of faith.
('55', 266, 1, 5, 505084) You are in every respect qualified to take such a risk.
('55', 266, 1, 6, 505140) Your institution is relatively an old one and has acquired a reputation for itself.
('55', 266, 1, 7, 505224) Some of your teachers are selfless workers, and the pupils are taught with love.
('55', 266, 1, 8, 505305) We have evidence of this in the fact that you have succeeded in training some pupils by your method and that you have friends who give monetary help regularly.
('55', 266, 1, 9, 505465) Hence, even from the practical point of view, my advice does not seem unsound.
('55', 266, 1, 10, 505544) According to me, absolute faith in ones work is also the highest practical wisdom.
('55', 266, 2, 11, 505627) Why do you suppose that, if you raise your fees and become self supporting, only the rich will send their children to your institution?
('55', 266, 2, 12, 505763) You must be admitting some children free.
('55', 266, 2, 13, 505805) You should pass on that burden to the rich.
('55', 266, 2, 14, 505849) They will pay, and must pay, that tax if they want their children to be educated in your institution.
('55', 266, 2, 15, 505951) Why do you entertain any doubt about the value to the people of the education which you impart?
('55', 266, 2, 16, 506047) Personally I am firmly of the view, and my view is based on actual observation, that even our best institutions do not grow to their full capacity because their heads spend much of their time in begging money for them.
('55', 266, 2, 17, 506266) The head of a school should devote himself exclusively to the internal development of the institution.
('55', 266, 2, 18, 506369) Instead, I have seen heads wasting their valuable time in collecting funds.
('55', 266, 2, 19, 506445) Personally I feel that in doing so those heads betrayed ignorance of their real duty.
('55', 266, 2, 20, 506531) They did not have faith in teaching as a vocation.
('55', 266, 2, 21, 506582) We see the result.
('55', 266, 2, 22, 506601) You and all the teachers should meet once among yourselves, and then again in the presence of the friends who have been providing you with funds.
('55', 266, 2, 23, 506747) Make your resolution at that meeting.
('55', 266, 2, 24, 506785) The meeting should be called not to seek the advice of those friends but to make your resolution and announce it.
('55', 266, 2, 25, 506899) Faith does not wait for anybodys advice, and if you wait for advice you will stand to lose.
('55', 266, 3, 26, 506991) I stop here today.
('55', 266, 3, 27, 507010) If you wish to differ from me on this issue again, you may do so.
('55', 266, 3, 28, 507076) If you can spare time to write to me, I certainly have enough time to reply.
('55', 266, 3, 29, 507153) I cannot get so much time when I am outside.
('55', 266, 3, 30, 507198) You should, therefore, take the fullest advantage of my wider knowledge and experience.
('55', 266, 3, 31, 507286) If you fail to do so, you will be the loser.
('55', 266, 3, 32, 507331) I do not hesitate in the least or feel the slightest embarrassment in claiming that I am something of an expert in this matter.
('55', 266, 3, 33, 507459) It is for you

('55', 267, 1, 2, 507515) to accept or reject my claim.
('55', 267, 1, 3, 507545) But just as a man who knows a cure for snakebite but doubts or hides his ability would be a great fool, so also, if I know my special ability and still hide it from others I would be as good a fool as he.

('55', 267, 7, 11, 507902) Major Bhandari has read to me the reply received from Government to my letter 2 of the 13th April addressed to Major Martin regarding, among other things, an illustrative list 3 I had submitted of non political associates who might visit me.
('55', 267, 7, 12, 508144) In continuation of that correspondence I now submit as full a list of names of non political associates as I can think of.
('55', 267, 7, 13, 508267) I have given a brief description of the persons mentioned in the list.
('55', 267, 7, 14, 508338) On the contrary I have confined myself to those whom I may wish to see in the near future.
('55', 267, 7, 15, 508429) These are in no sense political people.
('55', 267, 7, 16, 508469) I, therefore, suggest that when I want to see others outside the list, the Superintendent may be permitted to decide whether they come within the prescribed limits or not.
('55', 267, 7, 17, 508641) For I find that if each case not mentioned in the list has to be submitted to Government, the delay caused in receiving the reply is likely to defeat the very object of my application.

('55', 269, 2, 3, 511082) April 21, 1932
('55', 269, 3, 4, 511097) DEAR SISTER, I got the cotton and the honey yesterday.
('55', 269, 3, 5, 511152) May I thank you?
('55', 269, 3, 6, 511169) The cotton seems to have been carded in a mill.
('55', 269, 3, 7, 511217) You probably know that it can be of no use to me.
('55', 269, 3, 8, 511267) May I remind you of what I said last year?
('55', 269, 3, 9, 511310) I had hoped then that you would stock good, hand ginned cotton, get it carded at your place and give it to people to spin.
('55', 269, 3, 10, 511433) I wanted you to send me some from such stock of cotton, or if you did not have it, to obtain some from a khadi store.
('55', 269, 3, 11, 511551) It seems that the people in the office here could not explain this to you properly.
('55', 269, 3, 12, 511635) Send me such cotton immediately if you can secure it.
('55', 269, 3, 13, 511689) I was asked to give a list of persons other than inmates of the Ashram whom I should like to meet.
('55', 269, 3, 14, 511788) I had sent a few such names, which included yours also.
('55', 269, 3, 15, 511844) The government has replied that you can come to see me.
('55', 269, 3, 16, 511900) You may, therefore, now come along with a party from the Ashram or by yourself whenever you wish to.

('55', 269, 6, 19, 512103) 314. LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI
('55', 269, 7, 20, 512134) April 21/22, 1932
('55', 269, 8, 21, 512152) NARANDAS, I get your post regularly on Wednesday every week.
('55', 269, 8, 22, 512213) I got it yesterday too.
('55', 269, 8, 23, 512237) The results of the spinning competition were excellent.
('55', 269, 8, 24, 512293) I had certainly guessed that your speed would be very high, but the speeds reached by the others, too, are very good.
('55', 269, 8, 25, 512411) I should be happier if all this makes a difference in the total output.
('55', 269, 8, 26, 512483) The pain in my left elbow is of the same kind as in the right hand thumb, and the doctor has been advising me for some time that I should give up spinning for a few days and give complete rest to the elbow.
('55', 269, 8, 27, 512690) I told you about this in my last letter.
('55', 269, 8, 28, 512731) At the moment, all that I can say is that my experiment is continuing.
('55', 269, 8, 29, 512802) I can draw yarn with the right hand with fairly good ease.
('55', 269, 8, 30, 512861) It is too early yet to say

('55', 270, 1, 2, 512934) whether this will cure the pain in the elbow completely.
('55', 270, 1, 3, 512991) However, there is no cause at all for worry.
('55', 270, 1, 4, 513036) I shall give you definite information on Tuesday when I seal the letters in a packet.
('55', 270, 1, 5, 513122) I have started dictating this letter on Thursday.
('55', 270, 1, 6, 513172) I was glad that Mathuradas came and saw me.
('55', 270, 1, 7, 513216) It would be a good thing if Tilakam goes to Calicut, but we should not send him at our own risk unless somebody there offers to take care of him and treat him well.
('55', 270, 1, 8, 513381) As regards Amtul, I am writing to her.
('55', 270, 1, 9, 513420) Read that letter 1. I told you in my previous letter what I wrote in reply to the letter 2 I had from Darjeeling.
('55', 270, 1, 10, 513534) You may come here whenever you wish to.
('55', 270, 1, 11, 513574) You will be able to see those women whom the previous visitors did not see.
('55', 270, 1, 12, 513650) I have been trying to do for Kaka everything I can from here.
('55', 270, 1, 13, 513712) Use Soniramjis money as you think proper.
('55', 270, 1, 14, 513754) It should certainly be used for supplying free copies of the Gita whenever you think it justified.
('55', 270, 1, 15, 513853) The person who stole things from your room must have known what it contained.
('55', 270, 1, 16, 513931) I cannot resist the temptation of saying that Jamna deserved the lesson.
('55', 270, 1, 17, 514004) Nobody should keep a single pice in his or her room.
('55', 270, 1, 18, 514057) Anything one has should be deposited in the safe of the Ashram and that, too, only when the person has no other alternative.
('55', 270, 1, 19, 514182) Except for books, a few spinning wheels and such other articles necessary for our work, we should have nothing in our rooms.
('55', 270, 1, 20, 514307) Even the clothes should be the minimum we require for our daily use.
('55', 270, 1, 21, 514376) As a rich man feels happier the longer the list of his possessions, we should feel happier the shorter it is.
('55', 270, 1, 22, 514486) Our ideal is to have no possessions worth keeping a record of.
('55', 270, 1, 23, 514549) So long as we continue to possess things, our burglar friends are bound to claim their share.
('55', 270, 1, 24, 514643) Since we do not voluntarily offer it, they seize it by force.
('55', 270, 1, 25, 514705) You will of course read the letter which I am going to write to Kusum.
('55', 270, 1, 26, 514776) It would certainly be good if she learns nursing.
('55', 270, 1, 27, 514826) I also believethat Mrs. Lazarus 3 will treat her well.
('55', 270, 1, 28, 514881) But it seems to me that at present the work is beyond Kusums strength.
('55', 270, 1, 29, 514952) If she cannot preserve her own health, how will she be able to help others to preserve theirs?
('55', 270, 1, 30, 515047) Nursing the sick imposes no small strain on ones strength.

('55', 271, 0, 1, 515237) 272 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 271, 1, 2, 515279) Sometimes a nurse has to be on duty the whole of the day and the night.
('55', 271, 1, 3, 515351) And she is on her feet all the time.
('55', 271, 1, 4, 515388) Most of the patients have little endurance.
('55', 271, 1, 5, 515432) They are irritable and demand immediate attention.
('55', 271, 1, 6, 515483) Hence anybody who is sincere in taking up this work must make her body and mind strong.
('55', 271, 1, 7, 515571) Of course this is true only about a woman who wishes to be a devoted nurse.
('55', 271, 1, 8, 515647) A nurse who doesnt care for her patients and whose heart is not in her work is a disgrace to her profession.
('55', 271, 1, 9, 515756) A nurses job, if done sincerely, is more arduous than a doctors.
('55', 271, 1, 10, 515821) Good doctors have always given credit to the nurses and claimed none for themselves.
('55', 271, 1, 11, 515906) If Kusum has understood all this and if we can be sure that she can make her body strong enough for the work, I would certainly encourage her in her idea.
('55', 271, 1, 12, 516061) Personally, I have always been of the view that a nurse should remain unmarried.
('55', 271, 1, 13, 516142) The best nurses in the world are found among the followers of the Catholic Church, and that religion also supplies the largest number.
('55', 271, 1, 14, 516277) All of them are required to remain unmarried.
('55', 271, 1, 15, 516323) This is a special merit of the Catholic Church.
('55', 271, 1, 16, 516371) Another noteworthy fact about it is that all teachers, from the primary to the highest level, are unmarried persons.
('55', 271, 1, 17, 516488) We see very few other teachers who can excel them.
('55', 271, 1, 18, 516539) April 22, 1932
('55', 271, 2, 19, 516554) Dhiru had asked me in his letter whether he might send a Magan spinning wheel or himself bring one, and I had replied to him and told him that he could send or bring one.
('55', 271, 2, 20, 516725) How is it that it has not yet come?
('55', 271, 2, 21, 516761) I thought about that spinning wheel especially because of the pain in my elbow.
('55', 271, 2, 22, 516841) Padma, too, has in her letter urged me to use that model, and so I am more keen about it today than I was when I wrote to Dhiru.
('55', 271, 2, 23, 516970) If the spinning wheel is ready, send it with anybody who may be coming to see me.
('55', 271, 2, 24, 517052) If it reaches Bombay, even Dahyabhai will bring it.
('55', 271, 2, 25, 517104) He comes every Saturday.
('55', 271, 2, 26, 517129) I have already written to you in my previous letter asking you to send me some cotton.
('55', 271, 2, 27, 517216) Read the letter which I have written to Vinabehn in regard to Kusum.
('55', 271, 2, 28, 517285) I need not write anything more.
('55', 271, 2, 29, 517317) Manibehn will be released from the Belgaum jail on May 14. I had a letter from her, in which she says that Keshu had agreed to make a spinning wheel for her.
('55', 271, 2, 30, 517475) If it is ready, ask him to send it to Dahyabhai in Bombay.
('55', 271, 2, 31, 517534) If it is not ready, ask him to make it by and by and send it.

('55', 272, 1, 2, 517748) 315. LETTER TO E. E. DOYLE
('55', 272, 2, 3, 517775) April 22, 1932
('55', 272, 3, 4, 517790) DEAR COL.
('55', 272, 3, 5, 517800) DOYLE, If you, will turn up the file left by Major Martin, you will find I am referring to a matter that has been pending for some time.
('55', 272, 3, 6, 517937) Kaka Kalelkar you know perhaps as well as I do.
('55', 272, 3, 7, 517985) He is at present in the Belgaum Central Prison.
('55', 272, 3, 8, 518033) He was transferred from Visapur to Belgaum.
('55', 272, 3, 9, 518077) I have been trying to get accurate information about his health and that of three other companions, but beyond getting a little vague information after considerable delay I have been able to make no headway.
('55', 272, 3, 10, 518285) In the reply Major Martin sent me just before he left, he said that he was asking for the information that I had sought.
('55', 272, 3, 11, 518406) The information already received by Major Bhandari shows that Kakasaheb is weak.
('55', 272, 3, 12, 518487) Probably he has lost weight and does not get cows milk which he used to get here.
('55', 272, 3, 13, 518569) Therefore if there are no political reasons to the contrary, I suggest his transfer to Yeravda, and if he can be put with me I should bring him up, I hope, to the weight he reached here in 1930, i.e., to 116 lb.
('55', 272, 3, 14, 518781) Of the other three prisoners referred to in my letter to Major Martin of 13th April, Narahari Parikh has nose trouble which often causes great pain.
('55', 272, 3, 15, 518930) His wife Mrs. Parikh writes saying that she cannot even get acknowledgment from the Belgaum Prison although she has sent reply paid postcards.
('55', 272, 3, 16, 519073) She has not heard from her husband at all and naturally she is worrying.
('55', 272, 3, 17, 519146) I have myself written to Kakasaheb inquiring not only about him but about the other three also, because they are all inmates of the Ashram, but I have no reply from him or them.
('55', 272, 3, 18, 519324) I would like to have their personal letters if I may.
('55', 272, 3, 19, 519378) I presume that the object of allowing me to hold correspondence with fellow prisoners was to give me the human satisfaction that I need in the way of getting information from them as to their well being.
('55', 272, 3, 20, 519582) I know that you have only just arrived and must be very busy.
('55', 272, 3, 21, 519644) I would not have worried you almost immediately on your arrival, but for the pressing necessity of the cases I have brought to your notice.
('55', 272, 4, 22, 519784) Yours sincerely, M. K. GANDHI Government of Bombay, Home Department, I.G.P. File No.

('55', 273, 2, 3, 520003) [April 22, 1932] 1
('55', 273, 3, 4, 520022) MIRA, Your expected letter has just arrived.
('55', 273, 3, 5, 520067) Like you I need not delay mine.
('55', 273, 3, 6, 520099) I am delighted that you have Kamaladevi with you and that she joins you at the morning prayer and sings bhajans in the evening.
('55', 273, 4, 7, 520227) Her vigorous skipping reminds me of the time when I used to skip for the same reason as Kamaladevi.
('55', 273, 4, 8, 520327) I had taught the boys also.
('55', 273, 4, 9, 520355) Ramdas was the gracefullest and best.
('55', 273, 4, 10, 520393) It is certainly a fine exercise especially in winter.
('55', 273, 4, 11, 520447) It is good that you are continuing your saltless experiment and that it is agreeing with you.
('55', 273, 4, 12, 520541) We have here a new doctor.
('55', 273, 4, 13, 520568) He is a Parsi Major.
('55', 273, 4, 14, 520589) He loves his work and has the innate dignified courtesy that you see invariably associated with a cultured Parsi.
('55', 273, 4, 15, 520703) He has been giving me electric massage for the right thumb and the left elbow.
('55', 273, 4, 16, 520782) The elbow has been causing pain for some time, but only when I work in particular ways.
('55', 273, 4, 17, 520870) He thinks that it may be necessary to stop spinning for some days.
('55', 273, 4, 18, 520937) Having done double work during the National Week, so far as my output is concerned, it is now about 85 rounds per day.
('55', 273, 4, 19, 521056) For I have anticipated Dr. Mehta by using the left hand for turning the wheel.
('55', 273, 4, 20, 521135) This is my fourth day.
('55', 273, 4, 21, 521158) I have made very good progress.
('55', 273, 4, 22, 521190) The right hand draws much more steadily and the thread is finer and more uniform.
('55', 273, 4, 23, 521272) This additional practice with the left hand again makes me think of the necessity of our trying to use the left hand equally with the right.
('55', 273, 4, 24, 521413) And we should teach the children 3 from now to be ambidexterous.
('55', 273, 4, 25, 521478) I have already written about this to Narandas.

('55', 273, 5, 27, 521713) She and I began to take too much interest in the well being of the rest of the prisoners with the result that we were both removed to the permanent womens jail inside the big Arthur Road jail, where we were placed in one of three small barracks, which had a common verandah.

('55', 274, 1, 2, 522123) As a result of the two days, fast, I suppose, I have lost 2 lb.
('55', 274, 1, 3, 522187) in weight.
('55', 274, 1, 4, 522198) There is nothing in this loss, if I do not lose steadily.
('55', 274, 1, 5, 522256) If I do, I shall go back to milk without the slightest hesitation.
('55', 274, 1, 6, 522323) I have given you this information only by way of report.
('55', 274, 1, 7, 522380) You must not brood over this loss of weight.
('55', 274, 1, 8, 522425) The history of the Ashram goes on, though slowly.
('55', 274, 1, 9, 522475) In order to overtake the arrears of correspondence, I have suspended it for the past three days.
('55', 274, 1, 10, 522572) I shall soon resume it.
('55', 274, 1, 11, 522596) Study of the heavens has come to stay.
('55', 274, 1, 12, 522635) I have now a few books on it.
('55', 274, 1, 13, 522665) This study puts me more in tune with the Infinite.
('55', 274, 1, 14, 522716) I wont need to card for spinning.
('55', 274, 1, 15, 522750) Mahadev has already begun.
('55', 274, 1, 16, 522777) He always cards more than he spins and this he does for me.
('55', 274, 1, 17, 522837) The present stock being so regularly replenished is not likely ever to be exhausted.
('55', 274, 1, 18, 522922) Radha is largely to blame for her bad health.
('55', 274, 1, 19, 522968) She broods too much, gives more time than necessary to external tidiness and does not give herself full rest as prescribed by medical men.
('55', 274, 1, 20, 523107) I am not now inclined to press for Almora.
('55', 274, 1, 21, 523150) We should learn the poor mans art of living.
('55', 274, 1, 22, 523195) I know that I am the greatest hindrance in our march towards that ideal.
('55', 274, 1, 23, 523268) You and the other survivors will have to re arrange many things that, by my identification with them, have been or will be left as they should not be.
('55', 274, 1, 24, 523419) We are all keeping well except that Vallabhbhais nose and constipation still worry him as before.
('55', 274, 1, 25, 523517) Dr. Mehta is now dealing with both the disorders and hopes to produce some relief in a short time.
('55', 274, 1, 26, 523616) Whilst this was being written in the midst of interruptions, we saw from the newspapers received, that Kamaladevi had been transferred to Belgaum.
('55', 274, 1, 27, 523763) A prisoner has no choice.
('55', 274, 1, 28, 523789) His or her body is not in his or her own keeping.
('55', 274, 1, 29, 523839) Love from us all.

('55', 275, 3, 5, 524067) Why dont you?
('55', 275, 3, 6, 524081) Only you should write a clear hand.
('55', 275, 3, 7, 524117) It will be good exercise for me.
('55', 275, 3, 8, 524150) Have I spelt your name correctly?
('55', 275, 4, 9, 524184) I have not yet got Doctor Sharmas books.
('55', 275, 4, 10, 524225) I shall read them when I get them and tell you all about them.
('55', 275, 4, 11, 524288) For you, I am in correspondence with Narandas.
('55', 275, 4, 12, 524335) 2 Of course you can go to the Ashram when you wish.
('55', 275, 4, 13, 524387) What I feel is that you should live where you keep well.
('55', 275, 4, 14, 524444) There are opportunities for service everywhere.
('55', 275, 4, 15, 524492) A kind word spoken at the right moment is good service.
('55', 275, 4, 16, 524548) Even a kind thought that would translate itself into action is good service.
('55', 275, 4, 17, 524625) It is idolatry to think that there is no service but what is rendered through the body.
('55', 275, 4, 18, 524713) You should tell me how you pass your day.

('55', 275, 9, 23, 524835) DEAR, I think that you have erred in judging the people in the Ashram.
('55', 275, 9, 24, 524906) It is very difficult for one person to say of another whether he or she has love or not.
('55', 275, 9, 25, 524995) We know nothing of the struggles that go on in the human breast between the forces of good and evil.
('55', 275, 9, 26, 525096) We are ready enough to see the defects of people but we are unable to know how many conquests they have made.
('55', 275, 9, 27, 525206) What I say is not intended to signify that we are all perfect in the Ashram.
('55', 275, 9, 28, 525283) Far from it.
('55', 275, 9, 29, 525296) But I do want to say that one member has no right to judge another.

('55', 276, 1, 3, 525537) I have also noticed that those who are very exact in the performance of their own duty are often uncharitable to others, especially when they do not see them as assiduous as themselves.
('55', 276, 1, 4, 525723) This is a grave defect and a hindrance in the path of ones progress.
('55', 276, 1, 5, 525792) If we take care of ourselves, God will take care of the others, if they will not do so themselves.
('55', 276, 1, 6, 525891) Nor does my writing mean that you are mechanically to shut your eyes and ears to what may be going on in front of you.
('55', 276, 1, 7, 526010) What I have suggested is in no sense a mechanical performance.
('55', 276, 1, 8, 526073) It is a mental attitude which comes from training.
('55', 276, 1, 9, 526124) Meanwhile wherever you notice lack of love, you must as gently as possible bring it to the notice of those in whom you detect the defect and if you have not got enough gentleness to do so you should bring it at least to the notice of Narandas and leave him to do what he likes.

('55', 276, 7, 13, 526468) We do not take stray dogs under protection in the Ashram.
('55', 276, 7, 14, 526526) If we start doing that, the Ashram would be full of them, and we would be so busy looking after them that we would forget our duty to human beings.
('55', 276, 7, 15, 526674) The mantra which we recite before starting to eat is praise of God.
('55', 276, 7, 16, 526742) We should offer thanks to God whenever we start doing something.
('55', 276, 7, 17, 526807) As far as possible, we should not use goods imported even from China and Japan.

('55', 277, 7, 10, 527398) April 22, 1932
('55', 277, 8, 11, 527413) PREMA, I have already written 1 to you about Dhurandhar.
('55', 277, 8, 12, 527470) He has not gone on hunger strike.
('55', 277, 8, 13, 527504) I think you should not force Anandi 2 to go out for a walk with you.
('55', 277, 8, 14, 527573) If she has no strength, she will not be able to walk.
('55', 277, 8, 15, 527627) It will be enough if you teach her pranayama and some passive exercises.
('55', 277, 8, 16, 527700) Do you know what passive exercises are?
('55', 277, 8, 17, 527740) Regarding conversion, I dont mean that it is never justified.
('55', 277, 8, 18, 527802) But no one should invite another person to change his or her religion.
('55', 277, 8, 19, 527873) In my view, the belief which underlies such practice, namely, that ones own religion is true and anothers false is an error.
('55', 277, 8, 20, 527998) When, however, a person has changed his religion under compulsion or in ignorance, there should be no objection to such a person rectifying his error, that is, returning to his original religion; on the contrary, he should be encouraged to do that.
('55', 277, 8, 21, 528247) His action is not conversion.
('55', 277, 8, 22, 528277) If I think that my religion is false, I should give it up.
('55', 277, 8, 23, 528336) And I may, I ought to, accept what seems to me good in any other religion.
('55', 277, 8, 24, 528411) If my religion seems to me imperfect, it is my duty to try to make it perfect.
('55', 277, 8, 25, 528490) It is also my duty to try to rid it of any evil which I may see in it.

('55', 278, 0, 1, 528638) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 279
('55', 278, 1, 2, 528684) I regard Mirabehn as a Christian, and now she also regards herself as a Christian.
('55', 278, 1, 3, 528767) I see no inconsistency in her being a Christian and reading the Gita with devotion.
('55', 278, 1, 4, 528851) Persons belonging to other faiths also join in our prayers with sincere feeling.
('55', 278, 1, 5, 528932) I really dont know what we shall do after we get swaraj.
('55', 278, 1, 6, 528989) God will lead me then, as He does today.
('55', 278, 1, 7, 529030) A man who believes in God does not plan what he will do in future.
('55', 278, 1, 8, 529097) He who plans is not a man of faith, or rather his faith is weak.
('55', 278, 1, 9, 529162) There are not three separate paths, knowledge, devotion and action, for the realization of God.
('55', 278, 1, 10, 529258) The three form one single path.
('55', 278, 1, 11, 529290) That one path is divided into three aspects for the sake of convenience [of discussion].
('55', 278, 1, 12, 529379) Water is a compound of hydrogen and oxygen, but it is neither the one nor the other.
('55', 278, 1, 13, 529464) Similarly, knowledge is not a self sufficient path of God realization, nor is devotion.
('55', 278, 1, 14, 529552) It may be said that the path of God realization is a chemical compound of all the three factors.
('55', 278, 1, 15, 529649) This metaphor is defective, but it explains what I mean.
('55', 278, 1, 16, 529706) The protection of Draupadis honour is not a miracle 1 like the conversion of water into wine.
('55', 278, 1, 17, 529800) The faith that God succours his devotees when they are in distress helps one, and the examples which support such faith are worth cherishing.
('55', 278, 1, 18, 529942) If, however, a person cultivates devotion in expectation of such help, his devotion is of no value.
('55', 278, 1, 19, 530042) I do not approve of a policy of compelling people to become strong.
('55', 278, 1, 20, 530110) There should be no compulsion at all in this matter.
('55', 278, 1, 21, 530163) I have not known anyone who liked to remain weak in body.
('55', 278, 1, 22, 530221) This is a matter for education.
('55', 278, 1, 23, 530253) We should put before the people the ideal of reducing their needs to a minimum.
('55', 278, 1, 24, 530333) Having done so, we need not concern ourselves with the result.
('55', 278, 1, 25, 530396) Where is compromise in this?
('55', 278, 1, 26, 530425) The question of compromise does not arise at all.
('55', 278, 1, 27, 530475) The standard of life of the starving poor ought to be raised.
('55', 278, 1, 28, 530537) But this is not a new idea.
('55', 278, 1, 29, 530565) Even now we are making efforts towards that end.

('55', 279, 2, 3, 530812) April 22, 1932
('55', 279, 3, 4, 530827) PARASRAM, Who helped you to write the letter in Gujarati?
('55', 279, 3, 5, 530885) Whoever it was, his handwriting is excellent.
('55', 279, 3, 6, 530931) I assume that the actual language was yours.
('55', 279, 3, 7, 530976) one may certainly enter into loving rivalry with a fellow disciple of ones guru or with anybody else.
('55', 279, 3, 8, 531078) That is, we can take everybody who can do something better than we as our ideal and advance.
('55', 279, 3, 9, 531171) There should be no trace of envy in this.
('55', 279, 3, 10, 531213) I have used the adjective loving above to suggest this.
('55', 279, 3, 11, 531269) In such rivalry, we should wish in our heart that the person whom we have accepted as our ideal will improve his skill day by day, so that the ideal which we seek to attain will always be rising higher as we progress.
('55', 279, 3, 12, 531487) Such a wish will have a beneficial result for us too, since we shall be continually advancing.
('55', 279, 3, 13, 531582) I am firmly of the view, and it is my experience too, that, if a person has violated a moral principle in any one sphere of his life, his action will certainly have an effect in other spheres.
('55', 279, 3, 14, 531775) In other words, the belief generally held that an immoral man may do no harm in the political sphere is quite wrong.
('55', 279, 3, 15, 531892) And so is the other belief that a person who violates moral principles in his business may be moral in his private life or in his conduct in family affairs.
('55', 279, 3, 16, 532049) Hence, whenever we do an evil we should overcome [the tendency towards] it.

('55', 280, 2, 5, 532763) My Urdu handwriting will not improve till I practise writing in Urdu regularly.

('55', 281, 2, 3, 534144) April [22] 1, 1932
('55', 281, 4, 4, 534163) Under a fathers rule, exploitation may go on and the pool suffer.
('55', 281, 4, 5, 534229) A mother, on the other hand, would spin always for her poor children.
('55', 281, 4, 6, 534299) 2 The sacred thread and the rosary may give some help in cultivating holiness.
('55', 281, 4, 7, 534378) But they are not very useful today.
('55', 281, 4, 8, 534414) A cow is looked upon as a mother because, like a mother, she gives milk.
('55', 281, 4, 9, 534487) Moreover, a woman feeds her own children till they are one year of age, whereas the cow gives milk to all of us, and that is why she is our mother too.
('55', 281, 4, 10, 534639) A mother receives much service from her children.

('55', 281, 11, 19, 535007) See me here on your way when you are released.

('55', 282, 1, 2, 535694) I see that you have really tried to improve your handwriting.
('55', 282, 1, 3, 535756) The result shows that anybody can improve his handwriting if he tries.
('55', 282, 1, 4, 535827) This is true about everything.
('55', 282, 2, 5, 535858) To learn the Gita by heart also means that we should understand the meaning of every verse and pronounce the words correctly.
('55', 282, 2, 6, 535984) Who teaches you the Gita?
('55', 282, 2, 7, 536010) Perhaps you will tell me this only when we meet.
('55', 282, 2, 8, 536059) But if there is time and if the jail authorities let you do so, write your last letter before you are released.

('55', 282, 3, 12, 536397) Fortunately for him or for Dahyabhai, some one of us noticed it and immediately sent it to him.
('55', 282, 3, 13, 536493) Yashodas health is none too good.
('55', 282, 3, 14, 536527) Indeed she has not been well for many years.
('55', 282, 3, 15, 536572) Dahyabhai comes every week and can see both of us.
('55', 282, 4, 16, 536623) Jivatram 1 is still out of prison and working.

('55', 282, 4, 27, 537022) I do not know where she is at present.
('55', 282, 4, 28, 537061) Most probably she is in Poona.

('55', 283, 2, 4, 537860) Your letter was received here today and immediately given to me.

('55', 283, 8, 12, 538149) It is not correct to say that Lord Krishna exhorted Arjuna to follow the way of violence.
('55', 283, 8, 13, 538239) He only prevented him from doing a great evil in the name of non violence.
('55', 283, 8, 14, 538314) Arjuna had already committed violence when he assembled the army.
('55', 283, 8, 15, 538380) He, therefore, had no other course open to him.
('55', 283, 8, 16, 538428) He was not afraid of violence.
('55', 283, 8, 17, 538459) But he did not wish to kill relation.
('55', 283, 8, 18, 538497) He did not regard it as evil to fight other people.

('55', 284, 7, 11, 539172) I think they cannot play the game of hututu 1. In this game, the players touch one another so frequently that impure feelings are likely to be aroused in some boy or girl.
('55', 284, 7, 12, 539344) We should avoid that danger.
('55', 284, 7, 13, 539373) We should know that, when grown up boys and girls mix together in such fashion, impure feelings are likely to be aroused.

('55', 288, 3, 8, 543557) I am now ready to spin on the Magan spinning wheel.

('55', 288, 3, 11, 543709) Anyway, I will now preserve that letter.
('55', 288, 3, 12, 543750) Please remember that it is not ones body alone that can render service to others.
('55', 288, 3, 13, 543832) You can also serve if you live a truly celibate life and become a very learned woman.
('55', 288, 3, 14, 543918) They are born to no purpose who, though endowed with a strong body, do not use it for service.
('55', 288, 3, 15, 544013) And the knowledge acquired by such persons also goes in vain.

('55', 288, 9, 22, 544346) RAMBHAU, The account which you have sent of your progress is good.
('55', 288, 9, 23, 544413) As one person may live in several houses one after another, so also there is nothing strange if he should dwell in different bodies one after another.
('55', 288, 9, 24, 544564) Who knows whether Rama did grieve 1 as much as he is said to have done, or whether he grieved at all?
('55', 288, 9, 25, 544666) What we read is a poets account.
('55', 288, 9, 26, 544699) It is perfectly true that such grieving would not be seen in a man of spiritual knowledge.
('55', 288, 9, 27, 544790) We should, therefore, believe that our

('55', 289, 6, 8, 545172) The sacred thread ceremony has lost its significance for me nowadays.
('55', 289, 6, 9, 545242) Still, if the sacred thread ceremony is deemed essential, it should be performed only after the boys attaining maturity.
('55', 289, 6, 10, 545363) The sacred thread ceremony means entering new life and since then constant endeavour should be made to lead a life of self control and service.

('55', 290, 3, 5, 546756) Writing will stop automatically when I can no longer use my hand.

('55', 290, 9, 27, 547946) My aim in asking you to complete your study of Urdu is that you should read Maulana Shiblis writings.

('55', 290, 9, 31, 548285) You can send for the
('55', 291, 0, 1, 548306) 292 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 291, 1, 2, 548348) books from Azamgarh, where his office and madrasah are.
('55', 291, 1, 3, 548404) Most probably, you were with me during that tour and saw the place.
('55', 291, 1, 4, 548472) The present incumbent of Maulana Shiblis religious office is Maulana Suleman Nadvi, since the former, as you must be aware, died some time ago.
('55', 291, 1, 5, 548616) I get quite good letters from Lakshmi.
('55', 291, 1, 6, 548655) That is, she replies to mine as a matter of religious duty.
('55', 291, 1, 7, 548715) Her letters are rather short.
('55', 291, 1, 8, 548745) But she seems helpless.
('55', 291, 1, 9, 548769) She admits that she cannot think of anything to write and so contents herself with a few sentences.
('55', 291, 1, 10, 548869) However, whatever little she writes she writes beautifully, and her Hindi may be said to be quite good.
('55', 291, 1, 11, 548973) She writes a pleasing hand and seems to be a quiet girl.
('55', 291, 1, 12, 549030) But why need I describe her to you ?
('55', 291, 1, 13, 549067) I have given here, though, the impression she has made on me.
('55', 291, 1, 14, 549129) She has been writing, it seems, to the Ashram inmates too.
('55', 291, 1, 15, 549188) We are happy here.
('55', 291, 1, 16, 549207) We do not feel that we are in a jail.
('55', 291, 1, 17, 549245) How can men be styled State prisoners unless they enjoy complete freedom about food, sleep and all else?
('55', 291, 1, 18, 549350) As for visitors, Dahyabhai comes every week and he sees both of us together; but Mahadev does not have our status and, therefore, cannot join us at the interview.
('55', 291, 1, 19, 549513) Occasionally someone comes from the Ashram too, andwe two see the visitor.
('55', 291, 1, 20, 549588) Durga and Jivanji came once and saw Mahadev.
('55', 291, 1, 21, 549633) Now we have decided for the present that Durga should not come and unnecessarily spend money.
('55', 291, 1, 22, 549727) However, she is free to change her mind if she wishes, as she has not taken a vow not to come.
('55', 291, 1, 23, 549822) This is our daily routine: All three of us get up at 3.45 a.m.
('55', 291, 1, 24, 549885) After we have prayed together, Mahadev goes back to sleep and we two take honey and water and then have a walk.
('55', 291, 1, 25, 549997) Afterwards I sleep for about a quarter of an hour.
('55', 291, 1, 26, 550048) At 6.30 all the three have our breakfast consisting of bread, tea, etc., my tea of course being crushed almonds mixed in water.
('55', 291, 1, 27, 550176) I like it and have so far not felt the want of milk.
('55', 291, 1, 28, 550229) That is the only joint meal during the day.
('55', 291, 1, 29, 550273) The other two who drink milk have their next meal at about mid day, and I have mine at 4 p.m.
('55', 291, 1, 30, 550367) In between, I eat dates and almonds.
('55', 291, 1, 31, 550404) At 4 p.m.
('55', 291, 1, 32, 550414) I eat some vegetables, bread and almonds.
('55', 291, 1, 33, 550456) Mahadev has been doing a lot of spinning and carding, giving the spare time, if any, to reading.
('55', 291, 1, 34, 550553) At present he has also to go through the proofs of the book being published by the Oxford Press.
('55', 291, 1, 35, 550650) I take about two of his hours for my work.
('55', 291, 1, 36, 550693) Owing to the pain in the hand, since the National Week I have been spinning with the left hand and drawing the thread with the right.
('55', 291, 1, 37, 550827) I have had enough
('55', 292, 0, 1, 550845) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 293
('55', 292, 1, 2, 550891) practice by now and experience no difficulty, though the speed has of course slowed down.
('55', 292, 1, 3, 550981) Formerly I used to spin 375 rounds or more a week, but I cannot maintain a steady speed now.
('55', 292, 1, 4, 551074) I rest satisfied with whatever I can spin in two to three hours.
('55', 292, 1, 5, 551139) The highest number of rounds I have been able to draw so far with the right hand is 182. However, I feel confident that gradually the speed will increase.
('55', 292, 1, 6, 551294) As for my reading, I could get Urdu readers here and am going through them.
('55', 292, 1, 7, 551370) I read Ruskin also and give some time to books on astronomy too, as I have of late fallen in love with watching the stars.
('55', 292, 1, 8, 551493) With all this, I also find time for a nap of 20 or 25 minutes during the day.
('55', 292, 1, 9, 551571) I have started writing the history of the Ashram, having completed the remaining chapters of the Gita 1 some time ago.
('55', 292, 1, 10, 551690) That is the account of time for us two.
('55', 292, 1, 11, 551730) As Sardar suffers from some trouble in his nose, he remains content with reading newspapers mostly and reading out something from them to me.
('55', 292, 1, 12, 551872) He reads a little from other things too, but he cannot read much as his nose begins running with the leaststrain.
('55', 292, 1, 13, 551986) During this jail term, I do not generally ask for books from the Ashram.
('55', 292, 1, 14, 552059) Friends have been sending me enough for me to live on.In fact they are too many alreadyover two hundred, as I guess.
('55', 292, 1, 15, 552176) Not that all of them are worth reading.
('55', 292, 1, 16, 552216) I liked very much Upton Sinelairs latest book which he sent me.
('55', 292, 1, 17, 552280) In the form of a novel, it gives a very good account of the working of the American Prohibition Law.
('55', 292, 1, 18, 552381) I am sending you the book, which is named Wet Parade.
('55', 292, 1, 19, 552435) Others of his books are there in the Ashram, but I believe that this new book has probably not arrived there.
('55', 292, 1, 20, 552545) Mahadev told me a story of how you lost some books.
('55', 292, 1, 21, 552597) I was not surprised to hear it, as I think I know well enough your capacity for losing things.
('55', 292, 1, 22, 552692) Pyarelal is in Dhulia jail, and Prabhudas is in Belgaum jail, where I hear that he is in very good health.
('55', 292, 1, 23, 552799) He has put on two more pounds of weight.
('55', 292, 1, 24, 552840) Kakasaheb is very weak.
('55', 292, 1, 25, 552864) Jamnalalji, Vinoba, Gulzarilal, etc., are in Dhulia jail.
('55', 292, 1, 26, 552922) Ramdas is here, and so also are Chhaganlal Joshi, Surendra, Mohanlal, Qureshi, etc.
('55', 292, 1, 27, 553006) I am permitted to see them occasionally.
('55', 292, 1, 28, 553047) Mathuradas is in Nasik jail.
('55', 292, 1, 29, 553076) Taramati writes to me occasionally.

('55', 293, 3, 6, 553342) What is your diet?
('55', 293, 3, 7, 553361) You should eat fruit in sufficient quantities.
('55', 293, 3, 8, 553408) You ought to improve your health.
('55', 293, 3, 9, 553442) You need not worry about Jamnalal or Kamalnayan or anybody else.

('55', 294, 3, 6, 554333) The address is correct.

('55', 294, 3, 9, 554457) If you have heard from Mathuradas, let me know immediately.
('55', 294, 3, 10, 554517) How is your own health?
('55', 294, 3, 11, 554541) Do you get any chance to meet anyone?
('55', 294, 3, 12, 554579) To the extent that your health will permit you must undertake some work of service.
('55', 294, 3, 13, 554663) Doing work of service helps one to attain peace of mind.
('55', 294, 3, 14, 554720) One may serve even ones neighbours.

('55', 294, 9, 25, 555221) If you put his anger in one scale and dharma in the other scale, the former would weigh as light as air.
('55', 294, 9, 26, 555326) But you should first decide whether you regard brahmacharya as dharma.
('55', 294, 9, 27, 555397) If you are firm, your father will soon calm down.

('55', 295, 3, 5, 555877) Without hair, the head remains clean.
('55', 295, 3, 6, 555915) For a woman, absence of hair is a sign that she is observing brahmacharya.
('55', 295, 3, 7, 555990) If girls and grown up women get their hair cropped, the practice would cease to be regarded as sign of widowhood.

('55', 297, 2, 3, 558335) April 25, 1932
('55', 297, 3, 4, 558350) Many thoughts occur to me as I write the history of the Ashram.
('55', 297, 3, 5, 558414) I become aware of our many short comings.
('55', 297, 3, 6, 558456) These reflections have led me to the conclusion that from time to time we should draw up a balance sheet of our progress.
('55', 297, 3, 7, 558578) A business man draws up a daily, a monthly and a half yearly balance sheet of his business, and a comprehensive balance sheet at the end of every year.
('55', 297, 3, 8, 558730) We are engaged in the business of spiritual seeking and, therefore, we should draw up a balance sheet of our spiritual progress.
('55', 297, 3, 9, 558859) Everybody should draw up such a balance sheet for himself or herself and all of us together for the Ashram as a whole.
('55', 297, 3, 10, 558978) If we do not follow this practice, we would become spiritually bankrupt, as a business man who is negligent in drawing up the balance sheet of his business would find himself financially bankrupt.
('55', 297, 3, 11, 559175) If we do not know whether we are progressing or going backwards in keeping our vows and in our other activities, we would become mechanical in all our work and, in the end, become less efficient even than machines.
('55', 297, 3, 12, 559390) In other words, we would incur loss in our business.
('55', 297, 3, 13, 559443) How is such a balance sheet to be drawn up?
('55', 297, 3, 14, 559487) I will answer this question by writing down a few questions.
('55', 297, 3, 15, 559548) 1. Are we untruthful in our thoughts, speech or actions?
('55', 297, 3, 16, 559605) We means every one of us.
('55', 297, 3, 17, 559631) 2. If that is the case, who are the guilty persons and on what occasions were they guilty of untruth?
('55', 297, 3, 18, 559733) What did they do when their guilt was discovered and also what action did the Ashram take?
('55', 297, 3, 19, 559824) 3. During all these years of the existence of the Ashram, have we made any progress in this matter or have we become worse ?
('55', 297, 3, 20, 559949) 4. We should ask these questions in regard to all the vows and whenever we discover short comings, we should try to think out suitable remedies and employ them.
('55', 297, 3, 21, 560110) We can do the same with regard to the various activities in which we are engaged.
('55', 297, 3, 22, 560192) We have to think about them from two different points of view.
('55', 297, 3, 23, 560255) From the economic point of view, the question we

('55', 298, 1, 2, 560440) should ask is this: Is the activity self supporting? It is our faith that if an activity is found economically self supporting, from the moral point of view also it is likely to have been carried on along proper lines.
('55', 298, 1, 3, 560659) If there is either loss or profit, we may be sure that there has been a violation of moral principles somewhere.
('55', 298, 1, 4, 560772) The second point of view is this: Is the activity carried on primarily with a religious motive? It is essential that all our activities in the Ashram should be carried on with a religious motive, for everything we do ought to be subordinate to dharma that is, to truth.
('55', 298, 1, 5, 561042) Concerning both theseour vows and the other activitiesI cannot help asking the following questions: 1. How is it that in the Ashram itself people deceive one another in small matters?
('55', 298, 1, 6, 561226) 2. When shall we cease to distrust one another?
('55', 298, 1, 7, 561274) What can we do to bring this about?
('55', 298, 1, 8, 561310) 3. How is it that burglars from outside still continue to raid the Ashram?
('55', 298, 1, 9, 561385) 4. Why is it that the inmates have too many personal possessions?
('55', 298, 1, 10, 561451) 5. Why have we not cultivated contacts with the neighbouring villages?
('55', 298, 1, 11, 561522) What is the best way of doing that?
('55', 298, 1, 12, 561558) 6. Why do people continually fall ill in the Ashram?
('55', 298, 1, 13, 561611) 7. What have we done for the labourers who work in the Ashram?
('55', 298, 1, 14, 561674) Why is it that they have not been attracted to come and live in the Ashram?
('55', 298, 1, 15, 561750) Or, rather, why should there be any labourers at all in the Ashram?
('55', 298, 1, 16, 561818) In the Ashram there should be no masters and labourers.
('55', 298, 1, 17, 561874) I can write down many more such questions.
('55', 298, 1, 18, 561917) But these are enough to show what I have in mind.
('55', 298, 1, 19, 561967) I should like all people, young and grown up, to start thinking.
('55', 298, 1, 20, 562032) This was certainly one of my aims in insisting that all inmates should maintain a diary.

('55', 299, 3, 4, 562252) NARANDAS, Change the name of Ashram Samachar.
('55', 299, 3, 5, 562298) The name has given rise to a needless argument whether it is not a newspaper.
('55', 299, 3, 6, 562376) Since it is not a newspaper in any sense of that word, a name which suggests that it is, should also be dropped.
('55', 299, 3, 7, 562489) The title should be Ashramvasi ane Anya Mitro Pratye 1, and at the end Shankarbhai should sign: Your servant, Shankar.
('55', 299, 3, 8, 562608) There should be no subscription.
('55', 299, 3, 9, 562641) No copy is sent to anybody who was not in the Ashram.
('55', 299, 3, 10, 562695) The [present or former] inmates of the Ashram who receive copies must be contributing towards its expenses.
('55', 299, 3, 11, 562803) If these changes are made, I would be able to send to Chhaganlal and Gangabehn the very copy you send without being obliged to make fresh copies.
('55', 299, 3, 12, 562949) I think this is quite clear.
('55', 299, 3, 13, 562978) If you have not sent the cotton, dont send it now.
('55', 299, 3, 14, 563029) I got a parcel from Lady Vithaldas.

('55', 299, 6, 22, 563399) Tell Jivanji that he should not forget to send with some intending visitor Mahadevs notes concerning the Round Table Conference and his diary of our stay in London and the other things which I have asked him to send.

('55', 300, 5, 6, 564225) I wish you will not take to heart what the Bishop has been saying.
('55', 300, 5, 7, 564292) Your church is in your heart.
('55', 300, 5, 8, 564322) Your pulpit is the whole earth.

('55', 300, 5, 10, 564395) And what is this Catholicism?
('55', 300, 5, 11, 564425) It is surely of the heart.
('55', 300, 5, 12, 564452) The formula has its use.
('55', 300, 5, 13, 564477) But it is made by man.
('55', 300, 5, 14, 564500) If I have any right to interpret the message of Jesus as revealed in the Gospels, I have no manner of doubt in my mind that it is in the main denied in the churches, whether Roman or English, High or Low.
('55', 300, 5, 15, 564705) Lazarus has no room in those places.
('55', 300, 5, 16, 564742) This does not mean that the custodians know that the Man of Sorrows has been banished from the buildings called Houses of God.
('55', 300, 5, 17, 564869) In my opinion, this excommuni cation is the surest sign that the truth is in you and with you.
('55', 300, 5, 18, 564964) But my testimony is worth nothing, if when you are alone with your Maker, you do not hear His voice saying, Thou art on the right path. That is the unfailing test and no other.

('55', 300, 9, 22, 565246) I have your letter.
('55', 300, 9, 23, 565266) Brahmacharya is a mental state.
('55', 300, 9, 24, 565298) It is undoubtedly helped by abstentiousness in all respects.
('55', 300, 9, 25, 565359) But diet plays the least part in giving one the necessary mental state.
('55', 300, 9, 26, 565431) Not that wrong diet will not hinder progress.
('55', 300, 9, 27, 565477) What I want to say is that right diet, taken in moderation, is not the only thing in the observance of brahmacharya though it is undoubtedly one of the necessary things.

('55', 301, 1, 2, 565976) Indulgence of the palate will be the surest sign of weak mental state which is repugnant to brahmacharya.
('55', 301, 1, 3, 566082) The sovereign remedy for the observance of brahmacharya is realization that the soul is a part of the Divine and that the Divine resides within us.
('55', 301, 1, 4, 566230) A heart grasp of the fact induces mental purity and strength.
('55', 301, 1, 5, 566292) You should therefore read such books as would enable you to grasp the central fact, cultivate such companionship as would constantly make you think of the Divine presence and follow all the directions given about fresh air, hip baths, etc., in my book called Self restraint v.

('55', 301, 5, 12, 566850) Seeing that God is to be found within, no research in physical sciences can give one a living faith in the Divine.
('55', 301, 5, 13, 566965) Some have undoubtedly been helped even by physical sciences, but these are to be counted on ones finger tips.
('55', 301, 5, 14, 567075) My suggestion therefore to you is not to argue about the existence of Divinity, just as you do not argue about your existence, but simply assume like Euclids axiom, that God is, if only because innumerable teachers have left their evidence and what is more their lives are an unimpeachable evidence.
('55', 301, 5, 15, 567375) And then, as evidence of your own faithr epeat Ramanama 3 every morning and every evening at least for a quarter of an hour each time and saturate yourself with the Ramayana reading.

('55', 302, 7, 11, 568124) DEAR COL.
('55', 302, 7, 12, 568134) DOYLE, I thank you for your two letters and am expecting early information about my four friends in the Belgaum prison.
('55', 302, 7, 13, 568254) Since writing to you last, I have received two letters, one from Manibehn Patel and one from Kakasaheb Kalelkar.
('55', 302, 7, 14, 568367) From both the letters I could see that the very information that I wanted was scratched out by the Jail authorities at Belgaum.
('55', 302, 7, 15, 568495) The letters therefore proved practically valueless for the purpose for which they were intended.
('55', 302, 7, 16, 568592) And reading between the lines I could also see that Kakasaheb was not at all well.
('55', 302, 7, 17, 568675) However as you have kindly promised prompt attention, I am not disturbing the peace of my mind.

('55', 302, 11, 21, 568901) DEAR MR. NATARAJAN, I am sure you must have read the reports of an exhibition given by an Indian yogi of his powers before an audience specially assembled at the Gokuldas Tejpal Hospital.
('55', 302, 11, 22, 569089) The yogi is reported to have eaten a live vipers head, nails, nitric acid, and the like, and that the Chief Justice and his wife were among the distinguished audience.

('55', 303, 1, 2, 569392) The report states that one lady was so disgusted at the eating of the vipers head that she abruptly left the hall before the exhibition was finished.
('55', 303, 1, 3, 569542) I do not know how you look at such exhibitions.
('55', 303, 1, 4, 569590) In my opinion they are degrading both for the demonstrator, as also for the public.
('55', 303, 1, 5, 569674) And if the demonstrator died, as he most likely would, if these demonstrations were continued, those who encouraged him by attending them, I should hold guilty of manslaughter.
('55', 303, 1, 6, 569851) I do not think that either science or humanity is served by such revolting exhibitions.
('55', 303, 1, 7, 569939) The text books on Hatha yoga clearly lay down that the Hathayogisare expected not to exhibit their yogic powers or make use of them for purposes of gain.
('55', 303, 1, 8, 570093) If you agree with me, will you not initiate an agitation in the daily Press for preventing such cruel exhibitions?
('55', 303, 1, 9, 570208) One man, I suppose you know, recently died in Rangoon precisely giving demonstrations such as the one reported in Bombay.

('55', 304, 5, 9, 572278) Vatsala desires me to write to you.
('55', 304, 5, 10, 572314) I do feel that we should encourage our children to take a step like this or that, if we cannot go so far as to encourage them, we ought to give them complete freedom to act as they wish.
('55', 304, 5, 11, 572501) Even if she changes her mind later, it is not as if hair will not grow again.

('55', 305, 3, 8, 573772) My study of the scriptures is insignificant and of literature even less.
('55', 305, 3, 9, 573845) My knowledge of the vernacular too is of the same order.
('55', 305, 3, 10, 573902) Being well aware of my own short comings, I gave you my impressions 2 just as they occurred to me.
('55', 305, 3, 11, 574001) My friends, knowing my deficiencies but also my devotion to Truth, ask for my opinion whatever its worth.
('55', 305, 3, 12, 574107) Prompted by love I sent you my comments, but I could never have expected such a beautiful, poetic letter in reply.
('55', 305, 3, 13, 574222) I shall preserve it and read it again; which means that I must re read Saket from the viewpoint expounded by you.
('55', 305, 3, 14, 574336) Although your language is pretty easy, Ioccasionally find it difficult to understand it fully, owing to my scanty knowledge of Hindi.
('55', 305, 3, 15, 574470) Yet another reason of my difficulty is my limited Hindi vocabulary.
('55', 305, 3, 16, 574538) Is there any dictionary of Hindi wherein I may find the meanings of all the difficult words used in Saket and such other books?
('55', 305, 3, 17, 574666) I know that a determined effort will by itself make many things clear.
('55', 305, 3, 18, 574737) My vandemataram to Ajmeriji 3. I remember his bhajans very well.
('55', 305, 3, 19, 574802) God willing, I shall listen to them again some time.
('55', 305, 3, 20, 574855) Yes, I have written 4 to Parasram to include Saket and Anagh in the Ashram curriculum.
('55', 305, 3, 21, 574942) Possibly a start has already been made.

('55', 306, 3, 6, 575565) Boys and girls cannot play such a game together.

('55', 306, 9, 13, 575837) DEAR MAJOR BHANDARI, After all if a letter had to be written about getting the specialists here, Sardar Vallabhbhai thought that he should write the letter himself.
('55', 306, 9, 14, 576002) Hence the enclosed from him.
('55', 306, 9, 15, 576031) You will see in that letter absence of any mention of 12 lb.
('55', 306, 9, 16, 576092) loss of weight.
('55', 306, 9, 17, 576108) Of course I wholly disagree with you and the other doctors that these local troubles have nothing to do with the digestive apparatus.
('55', 306, 9, 18, 576242) As a layman I strongly hold the conviction that the nose trouble has much to do with the loss of weight.
('55', 306, 9, 19, 576347) In Sardar Vallabhbhais case in spite of his strong will, I know that the constant and irritating attention that the trouble invites disturbs him as it would anybody.
('55', 306, 9, 20, 576513) If nothing else, the disturbance itself would be a sufficient cause to put a person off his food.
('55', 306, 9, 21, 576611) I know that in my case I should simply stop taking food if I had such trouble.
('55', 306, 9, 22, 576690) I would impute it to something wrong in the stomach in spite of medical opinion to the contrary.
('55', 306, 9, 23, 576787) All this however is merely by the way.

('55', 307, 2, 3, 577027) April 27, 1932
('55', 307, 3, 4, 577042) I will still not give up hope of your reformation, for I have not given up hope about myself.
('55', 307, 3, 5, 577136) I have always believed that I was a bad man when Ba carried you in her body, but after your birth I have been doing greater and greater penance for my former life.
('55', 307, 3, 6, 577300) How can I, therefore, give up all hope?
('55', 307, 3, 7, 577340) I will continue to hope as long as you and I are alive.
('55', 307, 3, 8, 577396) And hence, contrary to my usual practice, I am preserving your letter so that, when you have awakened, you may see the insolence of your letter and weep over it and laugh at your folly.
('55', 307, 3, 9, 577582) I am not preserving this letter to throw it in your face then, but only that I may laugh at it, if God wills that I should see that day.
('55', 307, 3, 10, 577719) All of us are full of short comings.
('55', 307, 3, 11, 577756) But it is our dharma to overcome them.

('55', 308, 3, 4, 579142) LAKSHMI, I got your letter.
('55', 308, 3, 5, 579170) You find it difficult to write in ink because you are not accustomed to doing so.
('55', 308, 3, 6, 579252) But once you get accustomed to it you will discover that it is easier to write in ink than with pencil.
('55', 308, 3, 7, 579356) Moreover, there is greater pressure on the fingers when we write with a pencil, and hence the hand gets tired sooner.
('55', 308, 3, 8, 579474) I myself had written the letter.
('55', 308, 3, 9, 579507) If the handwriting resembles this, then the letter was written with the left hand.
('55', 308, 3, 10, 579590) My handwriting is certainly bad.
('55', 308, 3, 11, 579623) No one should copy me in that respect.

('55', 308, 7, 16, 579822) April 28, 1932
('55', 308, 8, 17, 579837) NARANDAS, We have two iron machines for crushing nuts, like almonds, etc.
('55', 308, 8, 18, 579911) One was sent by Gregg and is brand new, and the other has been used for some time.
('55', 308, 8, 19, 579994) Keshu or Premabehn is likely to know about them.
('55', 308, 8, 20, 580043) They were used only by Pyarelal.
('55', 308, 8, 21, 580076) Perhaps Kusum will know where they are.
('55', 308, 8, 22, 580116) If you can find them, send one of them to me immediately.
('55', 308, 8, 23, 580174) By immediately I only mean that it may be sent with somebody who is coming here to see me, or by railway parcel if it does not cost more than eight annas.
('55', 308, 8, 24, 580329) Let Keshu examine the machine before it is sent.
('55', 308, 8, 25, 580378) He, too, has had some experience of using them.
('55', 308, 8, 26, 580426) My experiment with almonds is going on.
('55', 308, 8, 27, 580466) One person requires about five hours to crush them, and the quantity lasts me barely nine days.
('55', 308, 8, 28, 580562) If I eat more every day, it would probably last only six days.
('55', 308, 8, 29, 580625) Why should anybody, I thought, have to labour so much when we have a machine for the purpose ?
('55', 308, 8, 30, 580720) Hence this request.
('55', 308, 8, 31, 580740) Some almonds were crushed today and they will last me till Friday week.
('55', 308, 8, 32, 580812) If the machine arrives before then, the problem will be solved.

('55', 309, 6, 7, 581222) April 28, 1932
('55', 309, 7, 8, 581237) The question you have put me about the meaning of pinda and brahmanda is a big one.
('55', 309, 7, 9, 581321) But I will explain the idea in brief.
('55', 309, 7, 10, 581359) For our purpose, we may understand the word pinda to mean our body, and the word brahmanda to mean the earth.
('55', 309, 7, 11, 581469) Now, the statement [as in the pinda, so in the brahmanda] means that everything that is in the body is there in the earth, too, and likewise there is nothing in the earth which is not in our body.
('55', 309, 7, 12, 581666) The latter is composed of the same substance as the earth.
('55', 309, 7, 13, 581725) There are five elements of the earth, and the body is made of the same five elements.
('55', 309, 7, 14, 581811) Innumerable creatures exist on the earth and also in the body.
('55', 309, 7, 15, 581874) As one body perishes and another is born, so the substance of the earth also is continually undergoing transformations.
('55', 309, 7, 16, 581994) We can amplify this analogy still further.
('55', 309, 7, 17, 582037) But we can deduce from what I have said, that if we know the real nature of our body, we shall know the real nature of the earth as well and shall not have to go far afield in seareh of knowledge.
('55', 309, 7, 18, 582234) Our body is the nearest thing to us, and if we understand it we shall have attained our object.
('55', 309, 7, 19, 582330) If we try to know about the earth, our knowledge will always be incomplete.
('55', 309, 7, 20, 582406) That is why wise men have told us that there is nothing in the brahmanda which is not to be found in the pinda.
('55', 309, 7, 21, 582518) Therefore, if we know the self, that knowledge will include all other knowledge.
('55', 309, 7, 22, 582599) But we may also enjoy the knowledge of other things which we gain while we strive for knowledge of the self, since we shall be enjoying it asincidental to our pursuit of knowledge of the self .
('55', 309, 7, 23, 582793) 2. I think that Narasinhbhai has not thought deeply enough in interpreting the Gita.
('55', 309, 7, 24, 582878) We should not confuse the Krishna of the Gita with the Krishna of
('55', 309, 8, 25, 582944) 1 This is not available.

('55', 310, 1, 2, 583105) history.
('55', 310, 1, 3, 583114) The problem before Krishna was not that of violence or non violence.
('55', 310, 1, 4, 583183) Arjuna shrank not from violence but from having to kill his relations.
('55', 310, 1, 5, 583254) Krishna, therefore, explained to him that in doing ones duty one ought not to treat ones relations differently from others.
('55', 310, 1, 6, 583378) In the age when the Gita was composed, the men who influenced its thought did not raise the question whether the violence committed in war was right or not.
('55', 310, 1, 7, 583535) That question seems to have been raised only in modern times.
('55', 310, 1, 8, 583597) The principle of non violence was accepted even then by all Hindus; but opinions differed then, as they do now, as regards what involved violence and what did not.
('55', 310, 1, 9, 583761) Our descendants may see violence in many things in which we do not see it today.
('55', 310, 1, 10, 583842) For instance, we do destroy life when we consume milk or cook cereals.
('55', 310, 1, 11, 583913) It is conceivable that future generations may wish to refrain from such violence and stop drinking milk and cooking cereals.
('55', 310, 1, 12, 584038) Today we commit this violence and still claim without any hesitation that we observe non violence.
('55', 310, 1, 13, 584137) In exactly the same manner, war was regarded such a normal thing in the age of the Gita that people did not feel that they violated the principle of non violence by engaging in it.
('55', 310, 1, 14, 584318) The illustration of the war in the Gita, therefore, seems to me perfectly innocent.
('55', 310, 1, 15, 584402) If, however, we reflect over the teaching of the Gita as a whole and examine the characteristics of the sthitaprajna, of the man who has merged in the Brahman, of the bhakta or of the yogi, we can come to only one conclusion, namely, that the Shri Krishna who taught the path of the Gita was literally an avatar of ahimsa and his exhortation to Arjuna to fight does not in the least detract from the purity of his ahimsa.
('55', 310, 1, 16, 584824) On the contrary, if he had advised Arjuna to follow any other course, I am sure that the perfection of his knowledge would have been called in question and he would never have come to be worshipped as the most perfect avatar of God.

('55', 311, 3, 4, 585290) PARASRAM 1. It does not befit us to ask the questions you have asked about Maulana Shaukat Ali.
('55', 311, 3, 5, 585386) We should not pay attention to the short comings of other people or sit in judgment over anybody.
('55', 311, 3, 6, 585484) We should exhaust all our energies in examining ourselves.
('55', 311, 3, 7, 585543) As long as we can detect even a single weakness in ourselves and, despite it, inwardly wish that our relatives, acquaintances and friends should not cut off relations with us, we are not entitled to see short comings inothers or criticize them.
('55', 311, 3, 8, 585788) If we unintentionally see such short comings in anybody, we may, if it lies in our power and if it is proper for us to do so, ask the person concerned about them, but nobody else.
('55', 311, 3, 9, 585968) There is no gain in asking other people.
('55', 311, 3, 10, 586009) However, since you wished to ask me, you did quite well in doing so.
('55', 311, 3, 11, 586078) For otherwise I would not have had an opportunity to lecture to you in this way.
('55', 311, 3, 12, 586159) And now I reply to your question.
('55', 311, 3, 13, 586193) From a distance and on the basis of the known facts only, we should not approve of the Maulanas activities.
('55', 311, 3, 14, 586301) However, I cannot arrive at any definite opinion without hearing in detail about his activities from his own mouth.
('55', 311, 3, 15, 586417) According to me, it is not correct to say that the followers of the Prophet ought to, or may, do all things done by him.
('55', 311, 3, 16, 586538) All people are not entitled to do everything that the great men may have done.
('55', 311, 3, 17, 586617) We have seen that such imitation leads to undesirable results.
('55', 311, 3, 18, 586680) However, we find that Hindus, Muslims and followers of other faiths do not only not follow this golden rule always, but even act as if they were entitled to do certain things because the Prophets or avatars had done them.
('55', 311, 3, 19, 586902) Seeing that this is the general attitude, I am not surprised that the Maulana has cited the Prophets example.
('55', 311, 3, 20, 587012) 2. What we do about Bhishma and others we may also apply to social workers of the present day.
('55', 311, 3, 21, 587107) I feel that the present practice of (offering) jalanjali needs reform.
('55', 311, 3, 22, 587178) Everyone who has written to me on the subject had nothing but praise about the Ramayana class which you have been conducting.
('55', 311, 3, 23, 587304) Go on in the same interesting way.
('55', 311, 3, 24, 587339) It would be in my view a great achievement if all at the Ashram come to love speaking in Hindi and

('55', 312, 6, 10, 587939) You should behave courteously with everyone and make yourself useful wherever you live.

('55', 314, 7, 9, 589753) I am going to write about the subject 2; so I do not expatiate on it here.
('55', 314, 7, 10, 589828) You drew the attention of a responsible person to what you felt was a slip.
('55', 314, 7, 11, 589904) Now you have only to watch what he would do.
('55', 314, 7, 12, 589949) As for you, you have done your duty.

('55', 314, 10, 14, 590055) 1 Mahadev Desai explains: Bapu was deeply pained to read Sankeys article in Newsletter.
('55', 314, 10, 15, 590143) He said it was a vicious piece of writing and he felt he should write to its author.
('55', 314, 10, 16, 590228) The Sardar who was listening to the dictation remarked: Instead of writing such a longish letter, why dont you simply tell him that he is a liar? Bapu laughed and replied, In fact I have said something stronger still.
('55', 314, 10, 17, 590446) I say his conduct is ungentlemanly.
('55', 314, 10, 18, 590482) I go further and say that he has betrayed a friend or colleague.
('55', 314, 10, 19, 590547) This is something that would cut an Englishman to the quick, but I have written what I felt.
('55', 314, 10, 20, 590640) People like Shafi and the Aga Khan who met him every now and then must have told him all these lies.
('55', 314, 10, 21, 590741) And he not only believed them to be true, but never asked me about them and throws the blame on me now when I am in prison.... The keenness of Bapus feeling is evident from this sentence in the first draft of the letter....
('55', 314, 10, 22, 590965) Part of the sentence was later replaced with the following: You have given it after rendering me incapable of defending myself. .
('55', 314, 10, 23, 591095) It is not true again that my claim is exaggerated.
('55', 314, 10, 24, 591146) Why should our claim to independence be considered exaggerated?
('55', 314, 10, 25, 591210) It may be so considered if I propose to reduce England to slavery.
('55', 314, 10, 26, 591277) I set forth the Congress demand in my speeches but during the discussions I dealt with any number of formulas. (The Diary of Mahadev Desai, Vol I, pp.

('55', 316, 9, 12, 592927) PREMA, If the burden of work is excessive on you, I cannot accept your view that it cannot be reduced.
('55', 316, 9, 13, 593030) That view betrays ignorant attachment and weakness.
('55', 316, 9, 14, 593082) I can believe that the cause of your irritability lies in yourself and not in the weight of work on you.
('55', 316, 9, 15, 593187) If that is so, you will gradually learn to keep your balance, for you will not deceive yourself for a long time.
('55', 316, 9, 16, 593300) I do not, however, wish to pester you about this.
('55', 316, 9, 17, 593350) Try to harden your sensitive nature.
('55', 316, 9, 18, 593387) Among our books there are some Urdu ones.
('55', 316, 9, 19, 593429) A few of them are likely to be with Imam Saheb.
('55', 316, 9, 20, 593477) Inquire in the Ashram too.
('55', 316, 9, 21, 593504) If you cannot identify them, Parasram will certainly be able to do so.
('55', 316, 9, 22, 593575) If you find Sirat Un Nabi among these books, send it to me.
('55', 316, 9, 23, 593635) It is written by Maulana Shibli.
('55', 316, 9, 24, 593668) There is another biography of Nabi written by Dr. Mahomed Ali.
('55', 316, 9, 25, 593731) Send that too.
('55', 316, 9, 26, 593746) The Sirat is in two parts.You are surrounded on all sides by labourers, and the life which they lead is the only true life.
('55', 316, 9, 27, 593870) That has been the idea behind the Ashram.
('55', 316, 9, 28, 593912) True, the labourers should be seekers after truth.
('55', 316, 9, 29, 593963) Are you not one?
('55', 316, 9, 30, 593980) Are not the other women and the men also such seekers?

('55', 317, 1, 4, 594367) If you use your eyes, you cannot but see me.
('55', 317, 1, 5, 594412) My spirit dwells there, though the body may be here, and it will continue to dwell there even if the latter is reduced to ashes.
('55', 317, 1, 6, 594541) It is quite possible that when I am there in body, my soul may not be there.
('55', 317, 1, 7, 594618) Understand this truth and give up your ignorant idea.
('55', 317, 1, 8, 594672) One must feel discontent, but it should be regarding oneself.
('55', 317, 1, 9, 594734) The day one believes that one has become perfect, ones fall has begun.
('55', 317, 1, 10, 594805) Hence one ought to be discontented about oneself.
('55', 317, 1, 11, 594855) But such discontent does not mean that one should wish all the time to take up new duties.
('55', 317, 1, 12, 594946) I cannot, however, explain all this by argument.
('55', 317, 1, 13, 594995) Time will do its work.
('55', 317, 1, 14, 595018) Where you see pitch darkness today, you will see light tomorrow.
('55', 317, 1, 15, 595083) Premal Jyoti 1 seems to me to be the only bhajan which truthfully describes this condition of mind.
('55', 317, 1, 16, 595183) The meaning is very well brought out in Gujarati.
('55', 317, 1, 17, 595233) The original English is a marvellous creation, though.
('55', 317, 1, 18, 595288) I have been told that Dhurandhar keeps fairly good health.
('55', 317, 1, 19, 595347) What is your present weight?

('55', 318, 6, 10, 596566) Spinning is meant for the millions of Indians who do not have an occupation for six months in the year.
('55', 318, 6, 11, 596670) In short, a person may spin under any pretext; what his spinning adds to the wealth of the nation is the benefit we get from it.

('55', 319, 7, 10, 597591) May 2, 1932
('55', 319, 8, 11, 597603) I received a letter from Shri Bhagwanji regarding the self purification week celebrated in April last.
('55', 319, 8, 12, 597706) In that letter he draws my attention to the waste of cotton which occurs and he also suspects that some persons knowingly gave a higher figure for the yarn spun by them.
('55', 319, 8, 13, 597876) He states that the waste was of two kinds: one, the quantity of broken threads was more than permissible, and, two, since the spinning was done with excessive speed the count of the yarn spun was very low.
('55', 319, 9, 14, 598082) If anybody knowingly gave a wrong figure for the yarn spun by him or her, I would regard it as a serious matter.
('55', 319, 9, 15, 598195) Such conduct would be a blot on the good name of the Ashram.
('55', 319, 9, 16, 598256) The spinning done by a person who gives a wrong figure will not be accepted by God as yajna.
('55', 319, 9, 17, 598349) The figure entered in our records has no value.
('55', 319, 9, 18, 598397) The real value of the spinning done remains what it is.
('55', 319, 9, 19, 598453) It cannot be increased or diminished by entering a higher or lower figure in our record.
('55', 319, 9, 20, 598542) Besides, the cash value of the yarn is no more than a few annas; its real value lies in the sincerity of the motive with which the spinning is done.
('55', 319, 9, 21, 598691) That value can never be estimated by us.
('55', 319, 9, 22, 598732) It is recorded only in the divine book, for who but God can understand mans motives.
('55', 319, 10, 23, 598817) 1 This was sent along with Letter to Narandas Gandhi, 28 4/2 5 1932; vide the following item.

('55', 320, 0, 1, 599001) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 321
('55', 320, 1, 2, 599047) However, we have one test.
('55', 320, 1, 3, 599074) If such yajna does not yield the expected result in time, we may conclude that there is some impurity in us.
('55', 320, 1, 4, 599183) Let everybody examine his work from this point of view and, if anybody has been guilty of untruth, let him or her humbly confess it and so purify himself or herself.
('55', 320, 1, 5, 599349) We cannot, in the Ashram, keep a secret watch over anybody; most of the work is carried on the basis of trust in one another.
('55', 320, 1, 6, 599475) The Ashram cannot be run on any other basis.
('55', 320, 1, 7, 599520) Everybody, therefore, should know his duty and do it.
('55', 320, 1, 8, 599574) Let the inmates also think if they have been guilty of anything else besides giving wrong figures for yarn.
('55', 320, 1, 9, 599682) Were they slack in doing the spinning?
('55', 320, 1, 10, 599721) Did they do it as a task forced on them?
('55', 320, 1, 11, 599762) Did they give to it less than the appointed time?
('55', 320, 1, 12, 599812) Did they throw away the broken threads?
('55', 320, 1, 13, 599852) This is the condition for a true yajna: the person doing it should give his whole hearted attention to the work, and do it with all his skill and intelligence.
('55', 320, 1, 14, 600012) Let nobody believe that he or she may behave anyhow throughout the year and still be able to observe the rules explained above during the National Week.
('55', 320, 1, 15, 600165) It should be remembered that ones whole life in the Ashram has to be a continuous yajna.
('55', 320, 1, 16, 600254) Among all its activities, spinning is the supreme yajna.
('55', 320, 1, 17, 600311) The only difference between the National Week and the rest of the year is that we give more time to spinning during that Week.
('55', 320, 1, 18, 600438) I suggest that the following rules should be observed in future: 1. If the yarn is of less than 20 counts, the spinning should not be regarded as yajna.
('55', 320, 1, 19, 600591) 2. If the waste exceeds a fixed limit, the spinning should not be regarded as yajna.
('55', 320, 1, 20, 600676) 3. If the strength of the yarn comes to less than a fixed limit, then also the spinning should not be regarded as yajna.
('55', 320, 1, 21, 600797) In yajna or any other work, the neatness of the product and the sincerity with which the work is done are more important than the number or quantity of what is produced.
('55', 320, 1, 22, 600967) Fifty bullocks who are physically unfit will prove a burden on the owner, whereas one strong bullock will do his work well.
('55', 320, 1, 23, 601091) Fifty knives with blunt edges will not be useful in mincing vegetables, but one knife with a sharp edge will do the work perfectly.
('55', 320, 1, 24, 601223) We should, therefore, learn to give our full attention to every work which we do.
('55', 320, 1, 25, 601305) We should devote the next [National] Week exclusively to this subject.
('55', 320, 1, 26, 601376) I observe that some inmates find spinning a boring work and
('55', 321, 0, 1, 601436) 322 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 321, 1, 2, 601478) prefer something else.
('55', 321, 1, 3, 601501) There is one natural weakness in this attitude.
('55', 321, 1, 4, 601549) A person is bored by the work which he has to do every day and persuades himself that, if he had been doing some other work instead, he would not get bored in that manner.
('55', 321, 1, 5, 601721) However, if that other work becomes his daily work, he would ask for something else still.
('55', 321, 1, 6, 601812) Besides, consciously or unconsciously persons who do spinning think of the low earnings from that work.
('55', 321, 1, 7, 601916) According to the standpoint of Ashram this is a wrong attitude.
('55', 321, 1, 8, 601980) The wage for spinning is the lowest because it is the only work at present which millions can do and which can help them to earn a little money.
('55', 321, 1, 9, 602125) All of us, therefore, do voluntary spinning as yajna in order to popularize the work.
('55', 321, 1, 10, 602211) The idea behind yajna is that we dedicate the work to God and have faith that He will provide us the wherewithal for our maintenance.
('55', 321, 1, 11, 602345) Let everyone understand this significance of yajna and daily do the yajna of spinning with whole hearted devotion and with zest.

('55', 321, 4, 14, 602549) April 28/ [May 2, 1932] 1
('55', 321, 5, 15, 602575) NARANDAS, I have already written to you today a letter 2 about the problem of Harilal.
('55', 321, 5, 16, 602662) I hope you will receive it without delay.
('55', 321, 5, 17, 602704) I need not, therefore, write anything more about the matter.
('55', 321, 5, 18, 602765) Send more pills for Gangabehn made from ten tolas of chaiarj and ten tolas of asafoetida.
('55', 321, 5, 19, 602855) I had received the quantity which I had asked you earlier to send.
('55', 321, 5, 20, 602922) If, you send the pills with somebody who is coming here to see me, I will arrange for their being delivered to her.
('55', 321, 5, 21, 603038) Personally, I liked Tilakams going to Thana.
('55', 321, 5, 22, 603083) Others also may go, if they are not likely to be a burden on Pyare Ali.
('55', 321, 5, 23, 603155) That would look nice too, for we should be as happy to be a Muslims guest as a Hindus.
('55', 321, 5, 24, 603242) Besides, it would be a painful thing if anybody felt that, since Tilakam was not one of us and since he came from an Antyaja family, the present arrangement was good enough for him.
('55', 321, 5, 25, 603424) If Jamna willingly goes there, Noorbanu will shower love on her.
('55', 321, 5, 26, 603489) Since the first day that we met I have always felt a beautiful light of purity shining in her eyes.
('55', 321, 6, 27, 603589) 1 Inferred from the contents 2 Vide footnote on Letter to Narandas Gandhi, 28 4 1932
('55', 322, 0, 1, 603674) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 323
('55', 322, 1, 2, 603720) I hope Gangadevi is all right now.
('55', 322, 1, 3, 603755) I had a letter from Santok.
('55', 322, 1, 4, 603783) She says that she would like Radha to stay on in Deolali for four months more.
('55', 322, 1, 5, 603862) If that is likely to restore her health completely, it would be all right.
('55', 322, 1, 6, 603937) I have had no letter at all from Ba.
('55', 322, 1, 7, 603974) I cannot say that the change of hands in spinning has reduced the pain.
('55', 322, 1, 8, 604046) But I see that, had I not made this change, I would have been unable to continue working.
('55', 322, 1, 9, 604136) I can see from my experience of drawing the rounds with the right hand that slowly rotating the wheel causes much less strain in the elbow than drawing the rounds hour after hour.
('55', 322, 1, 10, 604316) I now draw about 200 rounds daily with the right hand.
('55', 322, 1, 11, 604371) That is five or ten more than the number I used to draw with the left hand a week ago.
('55', 322, 1, 12, 604458) The average then was 187_ [rounds] a day, or say rather that I kept up that average with an effort.
('55', 322, 1, 13, 604558) Of course, more time is spent now in spinning.
('55', 322, 1, 14, 604605) But in any case I had been giving more time in a week previously.
('55', 322, 1, 15, 604671) From every point of view, therefore, the present practice seems all right.
('55', 322, 1, 16, 604746) There is no cause at all for worrying about the condition of my hand.
('55', 322, 1, 17, 604816) There is, of course, no ban on printing copies of Watching the Heavens and the other articles I send, but I think it would be wiser not to print any.
('55', 322, 1, 18, 604966) Rather than print copies, the better course would be for somebody to dictate to a group of five to ten persons.
('55', 322, 1, 19, 605078) This would be more in keeping with our principles.
('55', 322, 1, 20, 605129) By following this practice, we would learn again the art of writing a neat hand.
('55', 322, 1, 21, 605210) The copies made in this manner could then be circulated among those who might wish to read the articles.
('55', 322, 1, 22, 605315) Those persons may make more copies if they wish to.
('55', 322, 1, 23, 605367) Or everybody should pass on the copy supplied to him, on the same day on which he receives it, to another person whose name is given to him.
('55', 322, 1, 24, 605508) In this way it will be possible to circulate a few copies among a large number of persons and all those who get them will read the article with special interest and derive greater benefit from it.
('55', 322, 1, 25, 605705) Think over this.
('55', 322, 2, 26, 605722) [May 2, 1932]
('55', 322, 3, 27, 605736) Read carefully what I have written about the work done during the National Week this time.
('55', 322, 3, 28, 605827) If you agree with me, show it to all others, and also try to follow in practice as much of it as can be done.
('55', 322, 3, 29, 605937) If you wish to make any changes in my suggestions, you may certainly do so.
('55', 322, 3, 30, 606013) I have, generally speaking, only my experience to go by.
('55', 322, 3, 31, 606070) In the Ashram you have a veritable mine of experience.
('55', 322, 3, 32, 606125) It is possibIe, therefore, that you will find some of my suggestions impracticable,
('55', 323, 0, 1, 606209) 324 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 323, 1, 2, 606251) but there is no doubt that we ought to pay attention to the fineness of the count and strength of yarn and to reducing waste.
('55', 323, 1, 3, 606377) At the examination, this was the method of evaluation formerly adopted.
('55', 323, 1, 4, 606449) The candidate was awarded marks equal to the figure of the count multiplied by that of the strength.
('55', 323, 1, 5, 606550) I do not know what method is followed now.
('55', 323, 1, 6, 606593) I would introduce the factor of waste in calculating the marksreduce the marks in proportion to the quantity of waste.
('55', 323, 1, 7, 606712) Mahadev and I have thought out this method.
('55', 323, 1, 8, 606756) Waste up to one tola for every pound [of yarn] may be condoned.
('55', 323, 1, 9, 606820) If the waste exceeds one tola, for every additional tola the marks arrived at by multiplying the figure of the count by that of the strength should be reduced by sixteen.
('55', 323, 1, 10, 606991) That is, the marks should be reduced by one for every 1/16 tola of waste.
('55', 323, 1, 11, 607065) If the waste is as much as ten tolas, the candidate should fail.
('55', 323, 1, 12, 607130) However, you yourself may decide whether waste, of one tola or of more than one tola per pound should be condoned.
('55', 323, 1, 13, 607245) I have given the figures merely as illustrations to explain my idea.
('55', 323, 1, 14, 607314) If I were an examiner, I would even take into account how the candidate sat when spinning, in what condition he maintained his spinning wheel, whether he kept the place where he sat for spinning quite clean and whether he could repair a spinning wheel when it went out of order, and calculate marks for all these.
('55', 323, 1, 15, 607628) This means that the work of the candidates would be constantly observed by somebody.
('55', 323, 1, 16, 607713) This observer would be one of the examiners at the test.
('55', 323, 1, 17, 607770) I would not mind if such a practice had the effect of reducing our output.
('55', 323, 1, 18, 607845) What is essential is that we should be sure in our minds that we were vigilant and were progressing from day to day.
('55', 323, 1, 19, 607962) I have stated in the accompanying note 1 that when the yarn spun is of less than 20 counts, the spinning should not be counted as yajna.
('55', 323, 1, 20, 608099) This does not mean that no credit should be given for the spinning done.
('55', 323, 1, 21, 608172) The candidate would go on spinning every day and be awarded marks for his work, the yarn could be made use of, but such a spinner should not be considered to be performing yajna.
('55', 323, 1, 22, 608351) He would be only a candidate.
('55', 323, 1, 23, 608381) Read the letter which I have written to Dr. Mehta.
('55', 323, 1, 24, 608432) Forward to Jetpur the letter which I have written to Manjula, Maganlals 2 wife.
('55', 323, 1, 25, 608512) I have forgotten her fathers name.
('55', 323, 1, 26, 608547) If you do not remember it, Champa or Ratilal will probably know it.
('55', 323, 1, 27, 608615) Read the letter before sealing it, and communicate the address to me also.
('55', 323, 1, 28, 608690) I have already written to you

('55', 324, 2, 9, 609310) The words are understood.
('55', 324, 2, 10, 609336) I have omitted them to save time.
('55', 324, 2, 11, 609370) As I write with the left hand, I naturally like to save as many words as I can.
('55', 324, 2, 12, 609450) You will observe that I pay more attention to making every letter in a ,word distinct.
('55', 324, 2, 13, 609537) I think that, if I write still more slowly, the handwriting with the left hand may be a little better.

('55', 325, 3, 5, 610406) I had hardly expected any reply to that letter.
('55', 325, 3, 6, 610454) I wrote it purely as a matter of duty that I thought I owed you.
('55', 325, 3, 7, 610519) However much we may differ in our views, in all I may do I want to be correct to the best of my ability and knowledge.
('55', 325, 3, 8, 610638) I quite agree with you that you could not possibly have said more than you have done in your letter under reply, so far as the first part is concerned.
('55', 325, 3, 9, 610790) As to the second part of your letter, it would ill become me, as a prisoner, to enter into any argument on merits.
('55', 325, 3, 10, 610905) I must therefore content myself by simply declaring my conviction that even the newspapers that I am permitted to receive show how grossly misinformed you must be with reference to the state of things in this country.

('55', 326, 6, 8, 612274) May 3, 1932
('55', 326, 7, 9, 612286) I got your letter.
('55', 326, 7, 10, 612305) I would not worry over the loss of twelve pounds of weight, if your strength has not gone down and you suffer from no particular disease.
('55', 326, 7, 11, 612443) I frequently write to Taramati, and this time she also has been writing fairly often.
('55', 326, 7, 12, 612529) In the last letter Dilip 2 also wrote two lines.
('55', 326, 7, 13, 612578) Of course I had to ask for that favour.
('55', 326, 7, 14, 612618) By now Taramati must have visited you.
('55', 326, 7, 15, 612657) According to me, rebirth is a fact proved by scientific experiments and by peoples memories of past lives.
('55', 326, 7, 16, 612764) To accept such memories as proof, we have to put trust in men who have narrated their experiences.
('55', 326, 7, 17, 612863) But so many persons have borne witness to their remembering their past lives that we cannot brush aside their evidence.
('55', 326, 7, 18, 612983) I would not, however, spend time convincing anybody about the reality of rebirth; nor would I enter into too much argument on the subject.
('55', 326, 7, 19, 613122) There are several things scientifically established, our disbelief in which is of no great consequence in our lives.
('55', 326, 7, 20, 613239) It is possible that rebirth may be so defined by somebody that the usual proof offered in support of it will not satisfy him.
('55', 326, 7, 21, 613365) My own definition of it is just this.
('55', 326, 7, 22, 613403) The soul does not cease to exist with the end of the body, but migrates from one existence to another, and that is rebirth.
('55', 326, 7, 23, 613527) That is, I would say that even Christians, Muslims and Zoroastrians who believe in the Day of Judgment believe in rebirth according to my definition of it.
('55', 326, 7, 24, 613683) The acquisition of another body, in my view, follows as a necessary corollary from this belief.
('55', 326, 7, 25, 613779) However, I know that the traditional Christian view does not permit it, though an increasing number of

('55', 327, 1, 2, 614028) Christians now believe in the possibility of the soul getting another body.
('55', 327, 1, 3, 614104) Lagnantar will not serve as a Gujarati equivalent of divorce.
('55', 327, 1, 4, 614166) Lagnantar means another marriage, which is possible even without a divorce.
('55', 327, 1, 5, 614242) If no current word is available, I would coin a new word Lagnabhanga.
('55', 327, 1, 6, 614312) On my asking Mahadev, he says that he was going to suggest this very word.
('55', 327, 1, 7, 614387) So we have, as the saying goes, two prescriptions of the same cure for an illness.
('55', 327, 1, 8, 614470) Taramati will probably find it difficult to get the Yeravda chakrathe Yeravda spinning wheelin Bombay.
('55', 327, 1, 9, 614573) I am writing to her and advising her to write to Bardoli or the Ashram and ask them to send it directly to you.
('55', 327, 1, 10, 614685) Your interpretation of Gita, XVIII.
('55', 327, 1, 11, 614721) [66] cannot contradict mine.
('55', 327, 1, 12, 614750) I do not now remember what the interpretation I offered in my letters was.
('55', 327, 1, 13, 614825) But I would certainly oppose your interpretation if you tried to make out the idea of surrender to God to be a path in itself unconnected with other duties.
('55', 327, 1, 14, 614982) I have often noticed that what we have said or wish to say had already been said by somebody else in different words.
('55', 327, 1, 15, 615100) Instead of noting a difference or contradiction between the two explanations, I see the identity of meaning.
('55', 327, 1, 16, 615209) What does it matter if the language differs?
('55', 327, 1, 17, 615254) I am aware that there are certain risks in following this method, but they exist only for those persons who twist the meanings of words to see and prove the identity of the meaning of the passages in question.
('55', 327, 1, 18, 615464) I dont think there is any such risk for a person who sees such identity spontaneously.
('55', 327, 1, 19, 615551) Hence, the question we face is, whether the better course is to form the habit of seeing identity of meaning or to proceed on the assumption that difference in language indicates difference in meaning.
('55', 327, 1, 20, 615753) In my view, it is dangerous to see difference in meaning in verbal difference.
('55', 327, 1, 21, 615832) I very much like to see identity rather than difference of meaning between Ishvar and Allah.
('55', 327, 1, 22, 615925) It seems that apart from Kishorelal and Jairamdas you have no other companions.
('55', 327, 1, 23, 616005) Ask them to write to me if they can without forgoing their right to write an ordinary letter, or include in such ordinary letter what they wish to write to me.
('55', 327, 1, 24, 616165) I had one letter from Jairamdas, to which I replied.
('55', 327, 1, 25, 616218) It is not at all necessary for you to let go writing a letter to Taramati for the sake of being able to write to me.
('55', 327, 1, 26, 616335) It would be enough if you include in your letter to Taramati whatever you wish to communicate to me; or, if you write in the letter to me what you wish to tell her, to that at any rate there can be no objection.
('55', 327, 1, 27, 616547) We three are happy here.

('55', 328, 1, 3, 616698) So far, the weight has been maintained.
('55', 328, 1, 4, 616738) And there is no complaint of constipation, so that I am carrying on with this diet for the present.
('55', 328, 1, 5, 616838) Mahadev points out that in Marathi they use the word vivahavichchheda for lagnabhanga.
('55', 328, 1, 6, 616925) Both the words had occurred to me but I liked legnabhanga better.
('55', 328, 1, 7, 616991) However, I would certainly accept the word vivahavichchheda and perhaps even prefer it since I supportthe view that the terms newly coined in Indian languages should be uniform.

('55', 328, 4, 12, 617278) May 3, 1932
('55', 328, 5, 13, 617290) DEAR SISTERS, I had intended to send this letter along with the post dispatched today, but forgot to do so as I was in some hurry and hard pressed for time.
('55', 328, 5, 14, 617447) After the packet of letters was handed over for posting, I remembered, and could still have written to you and sent the letter, but decided to put off.
('55', 328, 5, 15, 617599) I hope all of you help in nursing Gangadevi.
('55', 328, 5, 16, 617644) At the Ashram, it is our aim to create such an atmosphere that no one, including children and the old persons there, should feel the absence of relations.
('55', 328, 5, 17, 617799) Anybody who regulates his or her life by the principles of dharma should first look after those whom he or she does not regard as relations.
('55', 328, 5, 18, 617940) For, ones relations are not likely to remain uncared for, and if one makes it a point always to pay attention first to persons who are not ones relations, by and by one would learn to pay equal attention to relations and others.
('55', 328, 5, 19, 618169) It is a matter of congratulation that the children of Rabaris 1 are attending Manibehns classes.
('55', 328, 5, 20, 618266) I was glad to read what you wrote about the girls.
('55', 328, 5, 21, 618317) You will have taken a great step forward if you are able to act towards them exactly as you have indicated in your letter.
('55', 328, 5, 22, 618440) Two girls have put me this question in their letter: May girls use bob pins or hair pins?
('55', 328, 5, 23, 618530) Should they bind the hair with ribbons? I have replied to them as I thought fit, but I put the matter before you also.

('55', 329, 1, 3, 618774) At least they were not in the past.
('55', 329, 1, 4, 618810) In the West the women do their hair in different styles so that every woman needs a great number of hair pins and ribbons without number.
('55', 329, 1, 5, 618948) But we do not care for outward adornment and it does not befit us.
('55', 329, 1, 6, 619015) It is our duty to save every pie that we can, like misers; for the money which is given to us is not our property, we are only its trustees and, therefore, we are entitled to use out of it only just enough to feed and clothe the body.
('55', 329, 1, 7, 619250) I, therefore, believe that hair pins, etc., have no place in our life.
('55', 329, 1, 8, 619321) We should seek our happiness and that of our children only in such manner as befits us.

('55', 329, 6, 14, 619555) DEAR COL.
('55', 329, 6, 15, 619565) DOYLE, I thank you for your prompt reply 1 of 2nd instant in connection with my four friends and co workers in the Belgaum Central Prison.
('55', 329, 6, 16, 619704) 2 I thought that you would give me their weights.
('55', 329, 6, 17, 619754) I would still like to have them for additional satisfaction.
('55', 329, 6, 18, 619815) I am not free from anxiety yet about Kaka Kalelkar.
('55', 329, 6, 19, 619867) He often suffers from pain in the spine.
('55', 329, 6, 20, 619908) From the diet scale allowed to him I miss butter altogether.
('55', 329, 6, 21, 619969) You may remember that he had 4 oz.
('55', 329, 6, 22, 620004) of butter allowed to him here in addition to milk, bread and vegetables, and I know that he was able to take all that butter without suffering any harm and he was able to put on weight and feel energy coming to him, whereas when he was received here he felt weak and could with difficulty take regular exercise.
('55', 329, 6, 23, 620316) I would therefore like to know what his weight is now and whether he suffers from any pain in the spine.
('55', 329, 6, 24, 620421) The letter he was permitted to write to me distinctly states that he had that pain at the time of writing, i.e., on 13th April last.

('55', 330, 3, 5, 621000) But this I can say, that I should yield to no one in my desire for conciliation and peace.

('55', 330, 9, 20, 622119) If Mr. Gandhi shows a disposition to restore the relations which existed at the Round Table Conference, he will not find the slightest difficulty in conveying the fact to the Government without any intermediary.
('55', 330, 9, 21, 622331) The Government will consider the position thus created.
('55', 330, 9, 22, 622387) But one thing is quite clear, that there will be no question of making a bargain with the Congress as a condition of its co operation (The Hindu, 24 6 1932).

('55', 331, 1, 2, 622716) The jailor is the master of a prisoners body.
('55', 331, 1, 3, 622762) Hence, a satyagrahi should accept whatever food is served to him so long as he can do so with self respect and the food is not unclean or of a kind which he cannot eat.
('55', 331, 1, 4, 622931) He may eat it if he thinks that he can digest it, otherwise he may throw it away or return it if he has not already started eating it.
('55', 331, 1, 5, 623066) In this age, the laws of good health are generally observed in fixing prisoners food.
('55', 331, 1, 6, 623152) However, what should one do if they give only rotla and water?
('55', 331, 1, 7, 623215) One may discuss the matter courteously with the official but one cannot fight about it.
('55', 331, 1, 8, 623303) People can get many things, have got many things, by creating trouble for the authorities.
('55', 331, 1, 9, 623394) But we ought not to adopt such methods.
('55', 331, 1, 10, 623434) I, therefore, believe that you should not protest at all regarding the bhaji which is being served.
('55', 331, 1, 11, 623534) Those who wish may eat it and others may leave it.
('55', 331, 1, 12, 623585) We should thank God even if we get only rotlas and dal.

('55', 332, 3, 4, 624634) BHAI NANABHAI, Thinking about the matter objectively, I am indifferent whether Manilal and Sushila come or do not come.
('55', 332, 3, 5, 624754) In view of his vow, it would be good if they come but from the point of view of the health of all three 1 of them it would be better if they do not come.
('55', 332, 3, 6, 624908) Only they can tell how strictly they interpret his vow.
('55', 332, 3, 7, 624964) However, from what I know of Manilals nature I guess that he would not put an objective and strict interpretation on his vow and Sushila also, willingly or unwillingly, would identify herself with his point of view.
('55', 332, 3, 8, 625180) This is my analysis of their character.
('55', 332, 3, 9, 625220) They are both good and simple minded so that, wherever they are, they will take up some work of service and do their best.
('55', 332, 3, 10, 625343) As for revising Anasaktiyoga, I need the presence of Kishorelal.
('55', 332, 3, 11, 625408) Unless somebody wakes me up, I shall regard the book with a closed mind.

('55', 332, 9, 22, 625944) I got your letter.
('55', 332, 9, 23, 625963) If you ask reason for proof of the existence of God, what proof can reason give since God is above all reason?
('55', 332, 9, 24, 626074) For, if you say that nothing is beyond rational explanation, you will certainly run into difficulties.
('55', 332, 9, 25, 626177) If we give the highest place to reason, we shall be faced with serious difficulties.
('55', 332, 9, 26, 626262) Our own atman is beyond reason.

('55', 333, 1, 2, 626446) as they have tried to prove the existence of God.
('55', 333, 1, 3, 626496) But he who knows God and the atman with his intellect only does not know them at all.
('55', 333, 1, 4, 626582) Reason may be a useful instrument of knowledge at one stage.
('55', 333, 1, 5, 626643) But anybody who stops there will never enjoy the benefits of true spiritual knowledge, in the same way that intellectual knowledge of the benefits of eating food does not by itself help one to enjoy those benefits.
('55', 333, 1, 6, 626858) God or the atman is not an object of knowledge.
('55', 333, 1, 7, 626906) He Himself is the Knower.
('55', 333, 1, 8, 626932) That is why we say that He is above reason.
('55', 333, 1, 9, 626976) There are two stages of knowledge of God.
('55', 333, 1, 10, 627018) The first is faith, and the second and the last is first hand experience to which faith leads.
('55', 333, 1, 11, 627113) All great teachers of the world have testified to their having had such experience, and people whom the world would ordinarily dismiss as fools have also demonstrated their faith.
('55', 333, 1, 12, 627293) If we have faith, like theirs, one day we may have first hand experience too.
('55', 333, 1, 13, 627371) If a person sees somebody with his eyes but, being deaf, cannot hear him and then complains that he had not heard him, he would net be justified.
('55', 333, 1, 14, 627517) Similarly, to say that reason cannot know God betrays ignorance.
('55', 333, 1, 15, 627582) Just as hearing is not the function of the eyes, so also knowing God is not the function of the senses or of reason.
('55', 333, 1, 16, 627699) To know Him a different kind of faculty is required, and this is unshakable faith.
('55', 333, 1, 17, 627782) We know from experience that reason can be all too easily deceived.

('55', 333, 5, 23, 628043) ANASUYABEHN,
('55', 333, 6, 24, 628056) Dahyabhai first gave me the news about Indus illness.
('55', 333, 6, 25, 628110) I have now obtained more information from Shankerlal.
('55', 333, 6, 26, 628164) How did Indu fall ill?
('55', 333, 6, 27, 628187) How is she now?
('55', 333, 6, 28, 628203) Is it because of her illness that you are there?
('55', 333, 6, 29, 628252) How long will you remain there?
('55', 333, 6, 30, 628284) How are you?
('55', 333, 6, 31, 628297) Tell Saralabehn I am deliberately not writing any letter to her.
('55', 333, 6, 32, 628362) Of course I think of everybody.
('55', 333, 6, 33, 628394) We are well.

('55', 334, 7, 9, 628686) Take care of your health in every way possible.
('55', 334, 7, 10, 628734) If you are in good health, other things can be taken care of.
('55', 334, 7, 11, 628796) What advice can I give you at the moment?
('55', 334, 7, 12, 628838) What can I even suggest?
('55', 334, 7, 13, 628863) May God protect you.
('55', 334, 7, 14, 628884) I am writing a separate letter to Lilavati.
('55', 334, 7, 15, 628928) We have to consider about Gulzarilal.
('55', 334, 7, 16, 628966) But I am not worrying since Jamnalal is there.
('55', 334, 7, 17, 629013) Things here are proceeding well.
('55', 334, 7, 18, 629046) I have not yet felt the need to take milk.

('55', 335, 8, 12, 630188) Do you remember the frail little wife of Dahyabhai Yashoda.
('55', 335, 8, 13, 630248) She died on Sunday.
('55', 335, 8, 14, 630268) It was a deliverance for her.
('55', 335, 8, 15, 630298) She had fits and had almost lost her memory.
('55', 335, 8, 16, 630343) This means additional burden for Vallabhbhai.
('55', 335, 8, 17, 630389) For she has left behind her a bright boy about five years.
('55', 335, 8, 18, 630448) But he has broad shoulders.
('55', 335, 8, 19, 630476) My weight oscillates between 104 and 106. I am, therefore, not making any change.
('55', 335, 8, 20, 630558) I am trying to replace almond paste with ground nut paste.
('55', 335, 8, 21, 630617) If it agrees as well as almond, it will be good.

('55', 335, 8, 24, 630738) I am going to try it.

('55', 336, 1, 2, 631417) I am glad you have begun to use the left hand in place of the right.
('55', 336, 1, 3, 631486) It must be done not merely for writing.
('55', 336, 1, 4, 631526) Try to eat also with the left hand.
('55', 336, 1, 5, 631562) No special effort, save a little thought, seems to be necessary.
('55', 336, 1, 6, 631627) I am glad you had a few days with Sarojini 1 and that you were able to serve her.
('55', 336, 1, 7, 631709) What I have said about my being a hindrance is perfectly true.
('55', 336, 1, 8, 631772) I may help to start the thing, but, not being able to live up to it must hinder further progress.
('55', 336, 1, 9, 631870) The ideal of voluntary poverty is most attractive.
('55', 336, 1, 10, 631921) We have made some progress, but my utter inability to realize it fully in my own life has made it difficult at the Ashram for the others to do much.
('55', 336, 1, 11, 632070) They have the will but no finished object lesson.
('55', 336, 1, 12, 632120) We have two delightful kittens.
('55', 336, 1, 13, 632152) They learn their lessons from the mute conduct of their mother, who never has them out of her sight.
('55', 336, 1, 14, 632253) Practice is the thing.
('55', 336, 1, 15, 632276) And just now I fail so hopelessly in so many things.
('55', 336, 1, 16, 632329) But it is no use mourning over the inevitable.I have just had a card from Narandas saying that Gangadevi is no more.
('55', 336, 1, 17, 632446) She died cheerfully with Ramanama on her lips.
('55', 336, 1, 18, 632493) She and Totaramji were worthy of the Ashram.

('55', 337, 3, 4, 633130) DEAR COL.

('55', 337, 3, 6, 633215) Narahari Parikh and Prabhudas Gandhi were put together at Visapur, they were separated on being admitted to the Belgaum Central Prison.
('55', 337, 3, 7, 633351) They are all inmates of the Ashram.
('55', 337, 3, 8, 633387) Prabhudas Gandhi was Kaka Kalelkars pupil and Narahari Parikh his assistant and colleague.
('55', 337, 3, 9, 633478) I do not know that there was any reason for separating them from one another.
('55', 337, 3, 10, 633556) If there was none, you will perhaps agree that in the present state of the health of both Kaka and Prabhudas Gandhi, if all the three are together they can be mutually helpful.

('55', 337, 7, 14, 633845) May 7, 1932
('55', 337, 8, 15, 633857) DEAR COLONEL DOYLE, I wish to bring to your notice a matter that has reached the point of exasperation.
('55', 337, 8, 16, 633961) Over two months ago Sardar Vallabhbhai wrote two letters, one to his son at Bombay and one to Mr. G. V. Mavalankar at Ahmedabad, both of which were of a business type.
('55', 337, 8, 17, 634129) They were duly authorized, but never reached the addressees.
('55', 337, 8, 18, 634190) On March 26th Sjt.
('55', 337, 8, 19, 634209) Mahadev Desai wrote his monthly letter to his wife at the Ashram at Sabarmati.
('55', 337, 8, 20, 634288) The letter never reached her.
('55', 337, 8, 21, 634318) On the 28th ultimo I wrote, by permission, a letter addressed to the Ashram and meant for an erring boy of mine.
('55', 337, 8, 22, 634431) It was a most important letter in answer to his.
('55', 337, 8, 23, 634480) The letter was not delivered at the Ashram, though subsequent letters were delivered.
('55', 337, 8, 24, 634566) Almost invariably the Ashrampost reaches the Ashram two or three days after the due day of delivery.
('55', 337, 8, 25, 634667) I infer from this that the letters are delayed, where they are not withheld entirely, by some authority.
('55', 337, 8, 26, 634772) I know that correspondence of civil resisters is under strict censorship.
('55', 337, 8, 27, 634846) I have nothing to say against it.
('55', 337, 8, 28, 634880) But the correspondence sent from a prison, duly franked by prison authorities would, I should

('55', 338, 1, 2, 635020) imagine, be free from further censorship and consequent delay or danger of being withheld altogether.
('55', 338, 1, 3, 635122) I do not write letters uselessly and hope I am meticulous about observing the terms under which I am permitted to write these letters.
('55', 338, 1, 4, 635257) If they require a double censorship, it may be well to let us know.
('55', 338, 1, 5, 635325) If they are withheld even after being passed by prison authorities I think it is due to us that we should know at least the fact of detention.
('55', 338, 1, 6, 635468) The letter that I sent to my son was designed to affect the future course of his conduct and it had attached to it an original letter which my son had sent for my inspection and which he desired should be returned to him.
('55', 338, 1, 7, 635690) I have no desire whatsoever to write a single line that I would not like any Government official to see.
('55', 338, 1, 8, 635795) But I do feel hurt when even letters sent by prisoners that are held to be unobjectionable by prison authorities are delayed or intercepted in course of transmission.
('55', 338, 1, 9, 635962) I should, therefore, thank you if you would kindly enquire of proper authorities as to the fate of the letters in question.
('55', 338, 1, 10, 636086) I should be glad if it were discovered that my suspicions were groundless and that there had been no interference with this correspondence, and that the delays had been accidental and that the missing letters had been found and delivered to the addressees.

('55', 338, 5, 15, 636483) May 7, 1932
('55', 338, 6, 16, 636495) PREMA, If we make it a rule to draw up a balance sheet of our spiritual progress from time to time, we shall be able to get rid of unnecessary fears and appear to the world as we really are.
('55', 338, 6, 17, 636686) Obviously, this is true only about sincere people.
('55', 338, 6, 18, 636737) Those who are insincere will not be able to keep up the practice of drawing up such a balance sheet.
('55', 338, 6, 19, 636838) They will find it impossible.
('55', 338, 6, 20, 636868) I believe everything you say about Narandas.
('55', 338, 6, 21, 636913) He ought not to take up work beyond his strength.
('55', 338, 6, 22, 636963) No one should do that.
('55', 338, 6, 23, 636986) But generally man deceives himself.
('55', 338, 6, 24, 637022) He is generous towards himself, and when he has done a small thing he believes that he has exerted himself
('55', 339, 0, 1, 637129) 340 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 339, 1, 2, 637171) overmuch.
('55', 339, 1, 3, 637181) Ordinarily, therefore, when someone works hard I do not feel inclined to dissuade him from doing so.
('55', 339, 1, 4, 637282) But Narandass way is different.
('55', 339, 1, 5, 637314) He always takes too much work upon himself.
('55', 339, 1, 6, 637358) Since he generally does his work in time, a stranger may not perhaps see how much he had worked.
('55', 339, 1, 7, 637455) Hence it is but proper that Narandas should not undertake new burdens.
('55', 339, 1, 8, 637526) I have written to him to that effect.
('55', 339, 1, 9, 637564) 1 You should keep a watch.
('55', 339, 1, 10, 637591) My suggestion about a balance sheet is not likely to make anyone mechanical in his or her work.
('55', 339, 1, 11, 637687) If any person living in the Ashram becomes so, I would blame our method of running it.
('55', 339, 1, 12, 637774) I know that that method is not perfect.
('55', 339, 1, 13, 637814) But no one living in the Ashram has become mechanical in his or her work, and many who were mechanical have come to be filled with new life.
('55', 339, 1, 14, 637955) I infer from this that our method must be at least 51 per cent effective.
('55', 339, 1, 15, 638029) Those who are in charge of the various activities in the Ashram are not experts in their respective fields.
('55', 339, 1, 16, 638137) It is not their fault that they are not.
('55', 339, 1, 17, 638178) But it has always happened that the Ashram has either undertaken some new type of activity or has decided to carry on a traditional activity in a new manner, and, therefore, it has had to train its own experts.
('55', 339, 1, 18, 638389) This has resulted in some unnecessary expenditure of time and moneys and despite that the Ashram has not always done its work so well as to win praise.
('55', 339, 1, 19, 638541) The Ashram, however, exists not to win praise but toserve.
('55', 339, 1, 20, 638600) If it does the work of service so well that it wins praise for it, we may feel happy.
('55', 339, 1, 21, 638686) But, even if it is criticized, we should continue to serve.
('55', 339, 1, 22, 638746) The conclusion to be drawn from this is that, as we become progressively more efficient, we shall be able to do more work and shall feel the burden of work less and less.
('55', 339, 1, 23, 638917) Here is a recent experience.
('55', 339, 1, 24, 638946) When I started the practice of rotating the wheel with the left hand, on the first day I could spin only 93 rounds.
('55', 339, 1, 25, 639062) I also took more time and got more tired.
('55', 339, 1, 26, 639104) When my efficiency had increased relatively, I could spin more than 200 rounds in less time and felt less fatigued.
('55', 339, 1, 27, 639220) I have now started spinning on the Magan spinning wheel.
('55', 339, 1, 28, 639277) Yesterday I spun 24 rounds and spent much time.
('55', 339, 1, 29, 639325) Today I spun 56 rounds in less time.
('55', 339, 1, 30, 639362) The fatigue, too, was less.
('55', 339, 1, 31, 639390) What is true about an individual and his small task, is also true about an organization and its big undertakings.
('55', 339, 1, 32, 639504) Yoga is skill in work. 2 Work here means service, yajna.
('55', 339, 1, 33, 639561) All our difficulties arise from our inefficiency.
('55', 339, 1, 34, 639611) If we become efficient, what

('55', 340, 1, 2, 639752) seems a hardship today will become a source of joy.
('55', 340, 1, 3, 639804) I am convinced that in a wellorganized set up based on right principles, no tensions should be felt.
('55', 340, 1, 4, 639905) You have joined the Ashram to acquire this efficiency.
('55', 340, 1, 5, 639960) You will not learn it from anyone.
('55', 340, 1, 6, 639995) Everyone has to acquire it from the atmosphere in the Ashram.
('55', 340, 1, 7, 640057) If any person like you does not acquire it, he or she will not remain in the Ashram till the end.
('55', 340, 1, 8, 640155) I am not talking about those who have no ambition.
('55', 340, 1, 9, 640206) They will perhaps remain.
('55', 340, 1, 10, 640232) Since the Ashram is really an institution based on the principle of freedom, everyone in it may rise as high as he or she wishes.
('55', 340, 1, 11, 640362) But no one will be able to help a person who does not aspire to rise.
('55', 340, 1, 12, 640432) It is for you to create the atmosphere in which you can work well.
('55', 340, 1, 13, 640499) You can attract your friend to the Ashram.
('55', 340, 1, 14, 640542) Really speaking, however, that would be self centredness on your part.
('55', 340, 1, 15, 640613) All those who live there are your friends.
('55', 340, 1, 16, 640656) Give them what you have and receive from them what they have.
('55', 340, 1, 17, 640718) If you believe that you have nothing to learn from others except from one or two persons, you are sunk in the well of self delusion.
('55', 340, 1, 18, 640851) I think there is none in this world from whom we may not learn something.
('55', 340, 1, 19, 640925) What you write about Ramakrishna 1 is very likely to be true.
('55', 340, 1, 20, 640987) I do not regard myself as having attained any degree of spiritual realization, and I am sure, therefore, that I make mistakes again and again.
('55', 340, 1, 21, 641130) But being innocent mistakes, they seem to have done no harm so far.
('55', 340, 1, 22, 641198) I, therefore, continue on my path with an untroubled mind and also draw co workers into my experiments.
('55', 340, 2, 23, 641302) Blessings from BAPU
('55', 340, 3, 24, 641322) [PS.] Passive exercises help the weak; for example, massage, ardhashirshasana 2, ardhasarvasana lying down and raising the legs or the hands slowly upwards.
('55', 340, 3, 25, 641479) In all these, the patient remains passive and gives his or her mental co operation.
('55', 340, 3, 26, 641563) Do you follow this?
('55', 340, 3, 27, 641583) Prayers have often been attacked, but they have been kept up for 16 years.
('55', 340, 3, 28, 641658) How much time do they take?
('55', 340, 3, 29, 641686) How much of that time

('55', 341, 1, 3, 641899) Anyone who accepts the necessity of prayers will not grudge the time given to them.
('55', 341, 1, 4, 641983) We can point out a drawback in everyone.
('55', 341, 1, 5, 642024) On the whole, however, our prayers seem all right.

('55', 341, 6, 10, 642259) PARASRAM, The report is excellent.
('55', 341, 6, 11, 642294) It is not proper to take the name Kishorikant, 3 and the motive also behind taking such a name is unworthy.
('55', 341, 6, 12, 642402) It would have been better if the article about me had not been written.
('55', 341, 6, 13, 642474) But now you need not feel sorry for having written it.
('55', 341, 6, 14, 642529) You should not write any such article in future.
('55', 341, 6, 15, 642578) Your possessing books does not violate the vow of non possession.
('55', 341, 6, 16, 642644) They are not yours.
('55', 341, 6, 17, 642664) This is also true about slips of paper.
('55', 341, 6, 18, 642704) There is no universal rule that a person who has no children has an unfeeling heart.
('55', 341, 6, 19, 642789) We can try to know God through the study of chemistry, etc.
('55', 341, 6, 20, 642849) But that is possible only for a few.
('55', 341, 6, 21, 642886) Study of the sky is quite easy.
('55', 341, 6, 22, 642918) The effect of a diary depends on the kind of diary it is.

('55', 342, 4, 6, 643614) You must have read Fathers letter addressed to me.
('55', 342, 4, 7, 643665) It was first received there and then redirected to me.
('55', 342, 4, 8, 643720) I did not understand it clearly.
('55', 342, 5, 9, 643753) RUKMINI,
('55', 342, 6, 10, 643762) I got your letter.
('55', 342, 6, 11, 643781) As soon as you came down to the plains, both of you lost health again.
('55', 342, 6, 12, 643852) Does that mean that you should permanently stay at a hill station?
('55', 342, 6, 13, 643919) I hope that you have completely recovered now.
('55', 342, 6, 14, 643966) Do you take out Madhav for a walk every day?
('55', 342, 6, 15, 644011) See that you do not let the childs health suffer for any reason.
('55', 342, 6, 16, 644076) Write to me regularly.
('55', 342, 6, 17, 644099) If you follow Mirabehns practice and fix a day for writing to me, you will not have to try to remember.
('55', 342, 6, 18, 644203) You must have heard about Gangadevis death.

('55', 342, 10, 23, 644392) To observe the vow of non indulgence of the palate, we should eat, from among things acceptable to us, only as much as is necessary to keep our body healthy and strong.
('55', 342, 10, 24, 644561) If we observe this vow, we shall become healthy and remain so, shall find it easier to observe brahmacharya and acquire control over the mind in other ways too.

('55', 343, 3, 6, 644944) Only those like the Ashram who like freedom with self restraint.
('55', 343, 3, 7, 645009) True mercy has never done harm to anybody in this world.
('55', 343, 3, 8, 645066) We do not know the real facts about Prithviraj and, therefore, cannot say anything about his case.
('55', 343, 3, 9, 645165) In such matters, we should not cite examples from the past.

('55', 343, 7, 15, 645501) Even Urmilas protestations teach spiritual wisdom.
('55', 343, 7, 16, 645552) We should read the poem for its glorification of Rama.
('55', 343, 7, 17, 645607) Moreover, what comparison can there be between Urmilas separation from Lakshman and Durgas from Mahadev?
('55', 343, 7, 18, 645712) Yours is no separation at all.
('55', 343, 7, 19, 645743) You can write to him, see him if you wish to and get news about him from time to time.
('55', 343, 7, 20, 645830) Urmila had no such consolation.
('55', 343, 7, 21, 645862) How can we compare a forest with a jail temple, and fourteen years with two years?

('55', 347, 6, 10, 651292) Vallabhbhais sharp eyes detected a spiders web on it, and he immediately joked about it.
('55', 347, 6, 11, 651381) I discovered now the real source of Manibehns great love of neatness.
('55', 347, 6, 12, 651451) The envelopes in which I seal the letters for the Ashram are an illustration of this quality of Vallabhbhais.
('55', 347, 6, 13, 651561) Anybody who has not seen these envelopes should do so immediately.
('55', 347, 6, 14, 651628) Along with neatness, they exemplify great economy.
('55', 347, 6, 15, 651679) The letters which I write from here do not require very long envelopes.
('55', 347, 6, 16, 651751) It will, therefore, be observed that two envelopes are made out of the original one.
('55', 347, 6, 17, 651836) The brown paper which comes here in the form of packets, etc., is preserved and then used for making new flaps for the envelopes.
('55', 347, 6, 18, 651966) This was by way of introduction.
('55', 347, 6, 19, 651999) I noted Vallabhbhais comment, but at the moment I was impatient to try the spinning wheel.
('55', 347, 6, 20, 652090) The doctor had been advising me not to use the left hand even for turning the wheel.
('55', 347, 6, 21, 652175) Hence I thought that, if I could rotate the wheel with either foot, probably I would not have to drop spinning for a single day.
('55', 347, 6, 22, 652304) In my impatience to acquire control in managing the spinning wheel as soon as possible, I let the web remain where it was.
('55', 347, 6, 23, 652427) But I felt confident today that I would be able to work with my right hand, and so began observing the poor condition of the spinning wheel.
('55', 347, 6, 24, 652568) I saw that there was not only one web, but that there were webs in seven or eight places.
('55', 347, 6, 25, 652658) And the entire spinning wheel was

('55', 348, 0, 1, 652783) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 349
('55', 348, 1, 2, 652829) covered with dust.
('55', 348, 1, 3, 652848) The brass spindle bearers were covered with a sticky layer of grease and dust.
('55', 348, 1, 4, 652927) There was plenty of dust on the wooden boards too.
('55', 348, 1, 5, 652978) This should be deemed unpardonable.
('55', 348, 1, 6, 653014) The spinning wheel is the divine weapon of Daridranarayana.
('55', 348, 1, 7, 653074) It is the chief means of worship.
('55', 348, 1, 8, 653108) By neglecting it and allowing it to be covered with dust, we show lack of reverence for Him.
('55', 348, 1, 9, 653201) Generally, temples, mosques and other places of worship are kept clean.
('55', 348, 1, 10, 653273) But we believe that every spot on the earth is as sacred as a temple.
('55', 348, 1, 11, 653343) There is no place anywhere where God is not present.
('55', 348, 1, 12, 653396) To us, therefore, our bedrooms, dining rooms, libraries, lavatoriesall these are sacred as temples and should be kept clean as such.
('55', 348, 1, 13, 653529) All the more so a spinning wheel.
('55', 348, 1, 14, 653563) If we really believe in its power, none of us, from the very young to the old, would ever let a spinning wheel remain unclean.
('55', 348, 2, 15, 653690) I have already referred once to the cats love of cleanliness.
('55', 348, 2, 16, 653752) Recently I observed more evidence of it.
('55', 348, 2, 17, 653793) She gave birth to two kittens about a month and a half ago.
('55', 348, 2, 18, 653853) Their ways are wonderful.
('55', 348, 2, 19, 653879) The three are rarely found separated.
('55', 348, 2, 20, 653917) The mother cat lets the kitten suck whenever they indicate their desire.
('55', 348, 2, 21, 653990) The two cling to her and suck at the same time.
('55', 348, 2, 22, 654038) It is a sublime sight.
('55', 348, 2, 23, 654061) The mother has no feeling of false shame about the matter.
('55', 348, 2, 24, 654120) She does not perform all actions in public and anywhere.
('55', 348, 2, 25, 654177) As soon as the kitten could walk and play, she taught them the procedure to be followed for defecation.
('55', 348, 2, 26, 654281) She withdrew to a quiet spot where the earth was soft and dug out a small hollow.
('55', 348, 2, 27, 654363) She put the kitten in position over the hollow, afterwards covered the excreta with earth and made the spot as clean as it was before.
('55', 348, 2, 28, 654498) The kittens now follow that procedure every day.
('55', 348, 2, 29, 654547) They are a brother and a sister.
('55', 348, 2, 30, 654580) Four days ago, one of them was trying to dig a hollow in the earth, but the ground was rather hard.
('55', 348, 2, 31, 654680) The other one went to its help and the two together dug out a hollow of the required size.
('55', 348, 2, 32, 654771) After defecation, they covered up the excreta with earth and left the place.
('55', 348, 2, 33, 654848) Why should we not willingly do what these creatureseven the little onesdo?
('55', 348, 2, 34, 654923) The four words in the title are intended to suggest the same meaning.
('55', 348, 2, 35, 654993) Since we are conscious of ourselves as souls, our cleanliness must be both internal and external.
('55', 348, 2, 36, 655091) The former means truthfulness.
('55', 348, 2, 37, 655122) Truthfulness is the essence of purity, and is also another name for neatness.
('55', 348, 2, 38, 655200) If we are neat and tidy outwardly but have unclean minds, we make a false show or are guilty of pure hypocrisy, or that may be a sign of our lustfulness.
('55', 348, 2, 39, 655354) Thus, for men and women who strive to lead a
('55', 349, 0, 1, 655399) 350 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 349, 1, 2, 655441) life of self control, outward neatness is of value only if it is a sign of inner purity.
('55', 349, 1, 3, 655530) Our holiest temple is our body.
('55', 349, 1, 4, 655562) We should take care not to let it be infected with any impurity from outside.
('55', 349, 1, 5, 655640) We should not sully the purity of the mind with evil thoughts.
('55', 349, 1, 6, 655703) Anybody who follows this ideal of cleanliness will display neatness and tidiness in everything he does.
('55', 349, 1, 7, 655807) That would be his instinctive behaviour.

('55', 349, 4, 9, 655893) 425. LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI
('55', 349, 5, 10, 655924) May 4/9, 1932
('55', 349, 6, 11, 655938) NARANDAS, I got your letter.
('55', 349, 6, 12, 655967) Both the letter and the accompanying comments of Premabehn I found very useful.
('55', 349, 6, 13, 656047) I think you have become somewhat impatient.
('55', 349, 6, 14, 656091) The one virtue of your character which I value most is that you never undertake any work beyond your strength, do thoroughly whatever you take up and never lose your peace of mind.
('55', 349, 6, 15, 656272) We see a combination of these three virtues in very few persons.
('55', 349, 6, 16, 656337) I think you have shown it in your character.
('55', 349, 6, 17, 656382) It is now very necessary to take care that you do not lose this precious asset through impatience.
('55', 349, 6, 18, 656481) Everybody is not capable of doing everything.
('55', 349, 6, 19, 656527) We see a few persons who do many things but most people can do only a few things.
('55', 349, 6, 20, 656609) It is enough that you belong to the former class.
('55', 349, 6, 21, 656659) Provided you take care of your health and preserve your peace of mind and remain cheerful, I will say nothing against your taking upon yourself as much responsibility as you wish.
('55', 349, 6, 22, 656839) But one forgets this condition when one becomes impatient.
('55', 349, 6, 23, 656898) Maganlal forgot it and he paid a heavy price for it.
('55', 349, 6, 24, 656951) We should learn from his mistake.
('55', 349, 6, 25, 656985) Premabehn believes that you have taken upon yourself such a heavy burden that your body cannot bear the strain for long.
('55', 349, 6, 26, 657106) 1 Kusum also seems to agree with her.
('55', 349, 6, 27, 657144) Think over this and make whatever changes may be necessary.
('55', 349, 6, 28, 657204) If you have been hasty about anybody else, too, in any matter, you should rectify your mistake.
('55', 349, 6, 29, 657300) I think the following rules should be observed.
('55', 349, 6, 30, 657348) 1. Everyone should get one hour which he may spend as he likes.
('55', 349, 6, 31, 657412) Nobody should spend it in any work or activity which is part of
('55', 349, 7, 32, 657476) 1Vide also Letter to Premabehn Kantak, 7 5 1932
('55', 350, 0, 1, 657524) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 351
('55', 350, 1, 2, 657570) his daily routine.
('55', 350, 1, 3, 657589) 2. The period of silence at prayer time should be increased from one minute to five minutes.
('55', 350, 1, 4, 657682) One person should keep his eyes open and, when the five minutes are over, give a mild stroke on the bell.
('55', 350, 1, 5, 657788) 3. Spinning, etc., should be done only during the time left out of compulsory bodily labour like cooking, cleaning lavatories, helping in the dairy, working on the farm, washing and bathing, etc.
('55', 350, 1, 6, 657984) All these are essential activities.
('55', 350, 1, 7, 658020) We should so arrange our daily programme that we are able to do full justice to them.
('55', 350, 1, 8, 658106) 4. Sufficient time should be allowed to a person to leave one duty and take up another.
('55', 350, 1, 9, 658194) 5. If, as a result of arranging the work in this manner, it becomes necessary to engage paid labourers, you must engage a sufficient number of them.
('55', 350, 1, 10, 658343) But we should not treat them as labourers.
('55', 350, 1, 11, 658386) We should see to it that they get proper accommodation and clothes to wear and gradually we should draw them towards the Ashram rules.
('55', 350, 1, 12, 658521) These rules should be explained to them before they are engaged.
('55', 350, 1, 13, 658586) 6. If you can reduce the activities and do without paid labourers, that would certainly be the best course.
('55', 350, 1, 14, 658694) 7. Everybody, whether grown up or young, must go to bed as soon as it is nine.
('55', 350, 1, 15, 658773) Children under 12 should go to bed at eight.
('55', 350, 1, 16, 658818) You may revise these rules from time to time in the light of your experience there.
('55', 350, 1, 17, 658902) Though I think about these matters from here and raise issues for you to think over, you should carry out my suggestions only to the extent practicable.
('55', 350, 1, 18, 659055) I hope you do not discharge any labourers who are prepared to observe our conditions.
('55', 350, 1, 19, 659141) Though they work for wages, I regard them as inmates of the Ashram.
('55', 350, 1, 20, 659209) I had a long talk with Kusum, and so I do not say anything about the matter here.
('55', 350, 1, 21, 659291) Giridhari came and saw me recently Manibehn Parikh also was one of the party.
('55', 350, 1, 22, 659369) I cannot describe Dhirus health as satisfactory.
('55', 350, 1, 23, 659418) I got Dr. Sharmas books.
('55', 350, 1, 24, 659443) I also got Jodanikosh 1, etc.
('55', 350, 1, 25, 659473) The yarn spun by Chhakkaddas appears very clean and even in texture like silk.
('55', 350, 1, 26, 659552) I see that he has taken great care in spinning it.
('55', 350, 1, 27, 659603) Mahadev thinks that the count probably does not exceed 20. I have not examined the yarn carefully from that point of view.
('55', 350, 1, 28, 659726) But even if

('55', 351, 0, 1, 659824) 352 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 351, 1, 2, 659866) Mahadev is right, I would rate yarn of 20 counts which is strong and even in texture much higher than yarn of 40 counts which is weak and uneven in texture.
('55', 351, 1, 3, 660023) I am glad that Nimu has returned.
('55', 351, 1, 4, 660057) Will her mother stay there?
('55', 351, 1, 5, 660085) I should be happy if she does.
('55', 351, 1, 6, 660116) Ask Nimu to write to me every week without fail.
('55', 351, 1, 7, 660165) If she does, she will also be able to give some news which I may convey to Ramdas.
('55', 351, 1, 8, 660248) Jamna must run away to Bombay.
('55', 351, 1, 9, 660279) What is the name of the doctor who extracted Mathews tooth?
('55', 351, 1, 10, 660339) I think Mathew should be permitted to go and visit his father.
('55', 351, 1, 11, 660402) It seems to me that by and by he will become a fine worker.
('55', 351, 1, 12, 660462) He is good natured and gentle and his intentions are always good.
('55', 351, 1, 13, 660528) I have already written 1 to you that Gangabehn again requires asatotida powder and chaiarj, the same quantity as you sent before.
('55', 351, 1, 14, 660658) Mahadev got the parcel addressed to him.
('55', 351, 1, 15, 660699) It seems certain now that the packet 2 received from Jethalal has been lost.
('55', 351, 1, 16, 660776) What did it contain?
('55', 351, 1, 17, 660797) Who has signed the receipt?
('55', 351, 1, 18, 660825) If it is the rule in a jail to handcuff a prisoner when he is taken out and if a prisoner is so handcuffed he should not protest but, on the contrary, should cheerfully submit to being handcuffed.
('55', 351, 1, 19, 661022) This has been my view from the very beginning.
('55', 351, 1, 20, 661069) When I was taken out of jail in Pretoria and brought to a court to give evidence in a case, I was handcuffed.
('55', 351, 1, 21, 661179) I welcomed that, for I did not regard myself as different from other prisoners and never desired treatment different from theirs.
('55', 351, 1, 22, 661309) Today also I do not desire such treatment.
('55', 351, 1, 23, 661352) That there should be improvement in the treatment of prisoners is a separate issue, and the change should be brought about mostly by the efforts of people outside.
('55', 351, 1, 24, 661516) Prisoners can bring about a change only by obeying the harshest prison rules.
('55', 351, 1, 25, 661594) There is only one exception to this, which is really not an exception, namely, that a prisoner.
('55', 351, 1, 26, 661690) ought not to submit to anything which is humiliating.
('55', 351, 1, 27, 661744) The law does not permit humiliation of prisoners.
('55', 351, 1, 28, 661794) This may be taken as my general view.
('55', 351, 1, 29, 661832) Only those who had taken a vow to spin regularly before the struggle started may insist on being permitted to spin in jail.
('55', 351, 1, 30, 661956) There are very few such persons.
('55', 351, 1, 31, 661989) I cannot write more than this on this subject.
('55', 351, 1, 32, 662036) I have already written to you about Parvati.

('55', 352, 1, 3, 662302) We cannot be very rigid in such matters.
('55', 352, 1, 4, 662343) I have not received the cotton yet.
('55', 352, 1, 5, 662379) There is no hurry, of course, since I have already received four pounds from Lady Vithaldas.
('55', 352, 1, 6, 662472) May 9, 1932
('55', 352, 2, 7, 662484) I got the cotton.
('55', 352, 2, 8, 662502) The papayas were excellent.
('55', 352, 2, 9, 662530) The bread also was very good.
('55', 352, 2, 10, 662560) The cotton parcel cost a little too much.
('55', 352, 2, 11, 662602) But that is bound to happen sometimes.
('55', 352, 2, 12, 662641) The machine for crushing almonds was used the very next day after it arrived.
('55', 352, 2, 13, 662719) It saved much labour.
('55', 352, 2, 14, 662741) I have written 1 about cleanliness this time and what I have said should be carefully borne in mind.
('55', 352, 2, 15, 662842) Why did Dhiru bring the spinning wheel in such dirty condition?
('55', 352, 2, 16, 662906) Try and find out if Gangadevi gave any personal service to Totaram which some other woman also can give, and appoint someone for the purpose.
('55', 352, 2, 17, 663048) Are his requirements of food being looked after?
('55', 352, 2, 18, 663097) Jamna should leave and go away to Bombay without delay.

('55', 352, 8, 26, 663476) Just when, tired with other work, I had started writing this, your much awaited letter arrived.
('55', 352, 8, 27, 663572) Father and Mother are both very clever people and they know that my views very much resemble theirs.
('55', 352, 8, 28, 663673) That is why they ask you to follow my advice.
('55', 352, 8, 29, 663719) They have thus contrived to deprive you of your freedom.
('55', 352, 8, 30, 663776) And this innocent, crazy girl is now a prisoner of old people.
('55', 352, 8, 31, 663839) Let us see what happens.
('55', 352, 8, 32, 663864) After all, it does not matter that people like you and me are always drawn into their net.
('55', 352, 8, 33, 663955) The visit to Mount Abu seems to have done you no good.

('55', 353, 1, 9, 664524) Moreover, you are there to guide him.
('55', 353, 1, 10, 664562) Tell Hamida to write to me as soon as she leaves.
('55', 353, 1, 11, 664612) I had expected a letter from Rohini.
('55', 353, 1, 12, 664649) Many blessings to Kamalmiyan.
('55', 353, 1, 13, 664679) 1. I hope some day to give him a slap or two.
('55', 353, 1, 14, 664725) My bhrrr to the white beard.
('55', 353, 1, 15, 664754) Tell all that we think of them every day.
('55', 353, 1, 16, 664796) Some topic or other always crops up.
('55', 353, 1, 17, 664833) It is like what Hazarat says in his ghazal.
('55', 353, 1, 18, 664877) Even if one tries.
('55', 353, 1, 19, 664896) not to think about a thing, one does think about it.
('55', 353, 1, 20, 664949) Some things one cannot remember though one would like to, and some others one cannot forget though one tries to.
('55', 353, 1, 21, 665062) He never lets our wishes be fulfilled.
('55', 353, 1, 22, 665101) I was glad that you wrote the ghazal in the Gujarati script.

('55', 353, 7, 29, 665400) BHAI TOTARAMJI, I am overjoyed to learn that you are not grief tricken over Gangadevis death.
('55', 353, 7, 30, 665494) 2 The grief can be only out of self interest.
('55', 353, 7, 31, 665540) As for Gangadevi, she is released from pain and has undoubtedly attained a nobler state.
('55', 353, 7, 32, 665629) We all are thankful to you.
('55', 353, 7, 33, 665657) Chhaganlal and Gangabehn have expressed sorrow.
('55', 353, 7, 34, 665705) Chhaganlal grieves for her, remembering all her kindness to his children.
('55', 353, 7, 35, 665779) To me Gangadevi was the personification of renunciation, and her renunciation was combined with detachment which made it enduring.
('55', 353, 7, 36, 665910) It was an example to be emulated by us all.
('55', 353, 7, 37, 665954) I have found in you the quality of detachment.

('55', 354, 9, 18, 666896) However, if you wish you may let your hair remain.

('55', 354, 12, 23, 667087) May 10, 1932
('55', 354, 13, 24, 667100) When deciding what ones duty is, many questions may arise.
('55', 354, 13, 25, 667159) But when examining the teaching of the Gita, we have only to consider what Arjunas question was.
('55', 354, 13, 26, 667256) If a teacher goes beyond the scope of the question put to him, he would be a bad teacher, for the questioners attention would be fixed on his question and he would be in no fit state of mind to listen to other things.
('55', 354, 13, 27, 667474) The discussion may even be beyond his capacity and may, therefore, bore him.
('55', 354, 13, 28, 667551) Further,
('55', 355, 0, 1, 667560) 356 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 355, 1, 2, 667602) the reply to his question is likely to get lost in the discussion about irrelevant issues, in the same way that plants of grains in a field sometimes get buried under the weeds which grow round them.
('55', 355, 1, 3, 667802) From this point of view, Krishnas reply to Arjuna is perfect.
('55', 355, 1, 4, 667864) And when we leave Chapter I and come to Chapter II, we find that it breathes the pure spirit of ahimsa.
('55', 355, 1, 5, 667968) We should not, believing or claiming that Shri Krishna is the most perfect avatar of God, expect that we can get from his words a simple reply to every question that may arise in our minds in the same manner that we can find the meaning of a word by looking up a dictionary.
('55', 355, 1, 6, 668243) Even if we could find such replies, that would do us harm, for in that case nobody would strive for further advance or new discoveries.
('55', 355, 1, 7, 668379) Mans reason would simply atrophy.
('55', 355, 1, 8, 668413) Thus, the people of every age should strive to solve the problems of that age by their own hard labour and tapascharya.
('55', 355, 1, 9, 668533) We should, therefore, try to solve the problems which arise in the present age in regard to war and other issues with the help of the principles enunciated in a noble work like the Gita.
('55', 355, 1, 10, 668720) But even such help will be negligible.
('55', 355, 1, 11, 668759) We shall get real help only from what we learn through tapascharya.
('55', 355, 1, 12, 668827) Books on Ayurveda describe the properties of innumerable herbs and plants.
('55', 355, 1, 13, 668902) We may read those descriptions for guidance.
('55', 355, 1, 14, 668947) But the knowledge so gained will be useless, may even be burdensome, if the properties attributed to those herbs and plants do not pass the test of actual experience.
('55', 355, 1, 15, 669114) We have to seek solutions to the many difficult problems of life in exactly the same manner.
('55', 355, 1, 16, 669207) If you still wish to ask me any questions on this subject, please do.

('55', 355, 4, 19, 669326) 431. LETTER TO DEVDAS GANDHI
('55', 355, 5, 20, 669355) May 11, 1932
('55', 355, 6, 21, 669368) DEVDAS, Yesterday, the 10th, I got the letter you wrote on the 1st It was not delayed here.
('55', 355, 6, 22, 669460) According to me, this delay is not too long in the case of a prisoner.
('55', 355, 6, 23, 669531) After all, what is the value of his time?
('55', 355, 6, 24, 669573) 13/12 rupees per hour, for I think daily expense on account of a prisoner comes to Rs. 13. I think personally that the weakness of my hands is a symptom of old age.
('55', 355, 6, 25, 669738) Dont most old people suffer from some weakness or other?
('55', 355, 6, 26, 669795) We should remember that this weakness was there even when I

('55', 356, 1, 2, 669901) used to take milk.
('55', 356, 1, 3, 669920) Had it not been so, I would have perhaps got alarmed and resumed taking milk.
('55', 356, 1, 4, 669998) Has any of my experiments done me harm in the long run?
('55', 356, 1, 5, 670054) The only such case which I can remember is that of the last experiment, that is, Gopalraos experiment.
('55', 356, 1, 6, 670157) 1 I was hasty in starting it and waited too long before giving it up.
('55', 356, 1, 7, 670227) I persisted in it even though people were falling ill one after another.
('55', 356, 1, 8, 670300) From the economic point of view the experiment was a good one and Gopalrao had great faith in it.
('55', 356, 1, 9, 670398) Excepting this one, my impression about all other experiments is that I had benefited from them physically and spiritually.
('55', 356, 1, 10, 670522) This time I am wide awake.
('55', 356, 1, 11, 670549) I dont attach too much importance to the experiment.
('55', 356, 1, 12, 670602) After I am released from jail, I think I shall have to take milk and, therefore, here I wish to do without it only if I can do so without harm.
('55', 356, 1, 13, 670746) There is not the slightest cause for worrying about my health, as I have maintained my weight.
('55', 356, 1, 14, 670841) I will certainly go through the Urdu books which you have mcntioned, when they come.
('55', 356, 1, 15, 670926) This time I had intended to take up Urdu at a somewhat later stage since I wished to do some other reading before.
('55', 356, 1, 16, 671041) But Raihana began writing a few Urdu sentences in her letters to me and I thought that it would be good to reply to her in Urdu.
('55', 356, 1, 17, 671170) By and by I appointed her to be my Urdu teacher, and asked her to send me the corrections in the Urdu I wrote every week.
('55', 356, 1, 18, 671292) Of course this cannot satisfy me.
('55', 356, 1, 19, 671326) Hence I took out from the jail library here Urdu readers and began to study them.
('55', 356, 1, 20, 671408) As my Urdu handwriting is verybad, I have now procured a copy book and some tracing paper.
('55', 356, 1, 21, 671499) I am now trying to see how deep I can go into this study.
('55', 356, 1, 22, 671557) On the one hand is this Urdu, and on the other the Magan spinning wheel.
('55', 356, 1, 23, 671630) I am now giving my whole self to the Magan wheel since I had already decided to please Prabhudas and to test and utilize his abilities, and since to add to this the doctors here insisted on my giving complete rest to the left hand, which was possible only if I drew the yarn with the right hand and rotated the wheel with my foot.
('55', 356, 1, 24, 671961) I find it difficult to move the wheel with the foot and to draw the yarn with the right hand.
('55', 356, 1, 25, 672055) But I am confident that I shall succeed.
('55', 356, 1, 26, 672096) Some time ago I felt that I had acquired the necessary control, but lost it, today again I feel that I have partly regained it, though spinning in this manner takes quite a lot of time.
('55', 356, 1, 27, 672282) And third is Ruskin.
('55', 356, 1, 28, 672303) The study of economics, which was the fourth, has been suspended for the present.
('55', 356, 1, 29, 672385) The fifth thing is Maithilisharans Saket, which I wish to read carefully.
('55', 356, 1, 30, 672459) Mahadev and I have already

('55', 357, 0, 1, 672544) 358 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 357, 1, 2, 672586) read it once, and Vallabhbhai also has read it.
('55', 357, 1, 3, 672634) It seems to be a fine work.
('55', 357, 1, 4, 672662) I am sure if you secure a copy there and read it, you also will like it.
('55', 357, 1, 5, 672735) For you it will be very easy reading.
('55', 357, 1, 6, 672773) I shall send the book to you from here if you cannot get a copy from the Kalyan office.
('55', 357, 1, 7, 672861) And the sixth is watching the stars.
('55', 357, 1, 8, 672898) I have taken this up quite seriously.
('55', 357, 1, 9, 672936) During the day I read something on the subject and at night observe the particular stars carefully enough to be able to recognize them afterwards.
('55', 357, 1, 10, 673083) I wonder why I did not take serious interest in this subject earlier.
('55', 357, 1, 11, 673153) I always wished to do so, but the desire was not sufficiently strong to make me take up the pursuit immediately.
('55', 357, 1, 12, 673266) But now I see that everybody ought to cultivate as much acquaintance with the denizens of the sky as he conveniently can.
('55', 357, 1, 13, 673388) I believe that millions of people can, without much difficulty, acquire enough knowledge of them for their own satisfaction and raise themselves spiritually.
('55', 357, 1, 14, 673546) Anybody who tries to study the stars from a spiritual point of view will easily experience true joy of the heart and will be filled with greater devotion to God.
('55', 357, 1, 15, 673708) I do not know whether this is true of all, but I do know that such was the effect on me and that is why I have kept up the practice.
('55', 357, 1, 16, 673841) Probably you get no opportunity to see the sky at night.
('55', 357, 1, 17, 673898) When do they lock you up?
('55', 357, 1, 18, 673924) We three sleep directly under the sky.
('55', 357, 1, 19, 673963) Opposite we see the Venus shining, to our right is the Great Bear, and to the left the Swastika (the Southern Cross).
('55', 357, 1, 20, 674081) Leo roars right over our heads and Jupiter, too, is straight above us.
('55', 357, 1, 21, 674152) I read in Gujarati Hasan Nizamis Kavan Charit.
('55', 357, 1, 22, 674199) It did not make on me the impression it did on you.
('55', 357, 1, 23, 674251) When I read it I was not prejudiced against him, still I did notfeel that his motive was pure.
('55', 357, 1, 24, 674346) His language seems to be good, but for anybody who wants to read Urdu books for the sake of language there are many others equally good.
('55', 357, 1, 25, 674483) If one does not mind difficult words, Shiblis language has no small power.
('55', 357, 1, 26, 674558) I am sure you will like Upton Sinclairs Wet Parade.
('55', 357, 1, 27, 674610) There are many others of his books at the Ashram.
('55', 357, 1, 28, 674660) I got only two here, all the rest are there.
('55', 357, 1, 29, 674705) As for Mahadevs view of your capacity for losing books, you will know it from what follows.
('55', 357, 1, 30, 674797) You should not readily accept their no to your demand for a spinning wheel.
('55', 357, 1, 31, 674873) Carry on a courteous fight for it.
('55', 357, 1, 32, 674908) I will look into the book on health when it arrives.
('55', 357, 1, 33, 674961) Mahadev certainly did not receive the letter written to him from Delhi.
('55', 357, 1, 34, 675033) Lakshmi writes to me regularly and so do I to her.
('55', 357, 1, 35, 675084) Mahadev may or may not write to Durga a letter which will be a letter according to you.
('55', 357, 1, 36, 675172) But he asks me to add this here: His charge against you about losing books referred to the loss of as many as 80
('55', 358, 0, 1, 675285) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 359
('55', 358, 1, 2, 675331) books at the jail gate in 1930. It was the goodness of the stranger that he delivered them to us, but his goodness does not mitigate your carelessness.
('55', 358, 1, 3, 675483) If Mahadev had your company as he had twice formerly, he would have been much happier.
('55', 358, 1, 4, 675570) Sometimes when cooking he remembers you and recalls the Lucknow days when you did joint cooking.
('55', 358, 1, 5, 675667) When carding he remembers you daily (since you helped him in carding everyday).
('55', 358, 1, 6, 675747) And he unfailingly remembers you whenever he gets a good book to read (though he does not get much time to read, despite his having a whole heap of books with him, for spinning and carding take up four or five hours in the morning, then he spends two hours with me, and writing the diary in detail also takes up some time).
('55', 358, 1, 7, 676071) He remembers you when recalling memories of our stay in England, when singing bhajans at the time of prayer, when taking soda water in the evening, etc., etc.
('55', 358, 1, 8, 676230) If you read the Gitarahasya 1 in Hindi why didnt you read it in the Marathi original?
('55', 358, 1, 9, 676316) If you can read the whole of Shiblis volume you can make from it a beautiful book in Gujarati describing incidents in the Prophets life.
('55', 358, 1, 10, 676453) Kaka, Narahari, Mani and Prabhudas, all four of them underwent considerable suffering at Belgaum, but the problems have been nearly solved now.
('55', 358, 1, 11, 676597) I am in correspondence with all, (though not as regularly as I am with you).
('55', 358, 1, 12, 676674) But of course how long will the thing last!
('55', 358, 1, 13, 676718) Among newspapers, besides The Time [of India] we get The Leader, The [Bombay] Chronicle, The Hindu, and The Tribune.
('55', 358, 1, 14, 676835) Mahadev does not get much time to read them.
('55', 358, 1, 15, 676880) You know his indifference in the matter,but he pastes a good many cuttings.
('55', 358, 1, 16, 676956) (It is Sardar who reads the papers to us both.) The load of correspondence is getting heavier day by day.
('55', 358, 1, 17, 677062) In addition to the Ashram post, we get quite a good number of letters from other places (that is, from England and America).
('55', 358, 1, 18, 677187) The entertaining letter 2 which Romain Rolland wrote to an American friend about our stay with him has been published in India.
('55', 358, 1, 19, 677315) You will find quite a good deal of useful material from Mahadevs Diary and his album of cuttingshe keeps copies of important correspondence too.
('55', 358, 1, 20, 677460) Jamnalalji, Pyarelal, Vinoba, and Manilal Kothari, all of them are happy in the Dhulia jail.
('55', 358, 1, 21, 677553) Mathuradas and Kishorelal are at Nasik, Ramdas, Chhaganlal, Surendra and others are here, Kanti and other youngsters are at Visapur, and most of the Ashram women excepting Ba are hereI am in fairly regular correspondence with all these.

('55', 359, 5, 12, 678461) Do not give up the work which you have begun.
('55', 359, 5, 13, 678507) Look upon it as part of your education.
('55', 359, 5, 14, 678547) Why should we not treat everybody as a friend?
('55', 359, 5, 15, 678594) Exclusive friendships may even result in bitterness.
('55', 359, 5, 16, 678647) But our life will be full of joy if we regard everybody as a friend.
('55', 359, 5, 17, 678716) If you wish to spare the time required for the preparation of dramatics, etc., from the hours of manual work, you should consider whether the others can do without your help.
('55', 359, 5, 18, 678891) We should do what farmers and shepherds children do.
('55', 359, 5, 19, 678944) Why not spare the time for dramatics from the study hours?
('55', 359, 5, 20, 679003) Think over this and let me know.

('55', 360, 3, 6, 679584) When it becomes impossible to use my hand now, I rotate the wheel with my foot.
('55', 360, 3, 7, 679664) Since the slivers are very bad, my speed does not exceed 100 rounds.
('55', 360, 3, 8, 679733) When I start using better slivers, it will go at any rate to 160. As regards your digestion, take the measures I have described in my letter to Sarojini.
('55', 360, 3, 9, 679887) In addition to them, you should drink in the morning a glass of warm water with ten grains of soda mixed in it.

('55', 360, 8, 15, 680245) Aminabehns children have taught [the lesson] that parents should observe self restraint.

('55', 360, 8, 17, 680361) Men and women who observe celibacy can have no children.
('55', 360, 8, 18, 680418) If there are no births, there will be fewer to die.

('55', 361, 2, 3, 680762) May 11/12, 1932
('55', 361, 3, 4, 680778) PREMA, I asked you about your weight and diet 1 because I felt some doubt concerning your health.
('55', 361, 3, 5, 680876) What was your highest weight in the past?
('55', 361, 3, 6, 680918) Dont they cook tomatoes or bhaji any time?
('55', 361, 3, 7, 680961) They had decided to plant lettuce, what happened to that?
('55', 361, 3, 8, 681019) You yourself can plant lettuce or fenugreek in a small bed.
('55', 361, 3, 9, 681079) They will sprout in but a few days.
('55', 361, 3, 10, 681115) You must include some fresh green leaves in your diet.
('55', 361, 3, 11, 681170) Since one can eat them uncooked only in small quantities, growing them is no difficult matter.
('55', 361, 3, 12, 681265) I dont know why tomatoes cannot be grown all the year round.
('55', 361, 3, 13, 681326) Ask someone.
('55', 361, 3, 14, 681339) I met Dhurandhar immediately [after he was brought here] and visit him from time to time, for I had come to know him closely during the March.
('55', 361, 3, 15, 681482) Moreover, since I take interest in your life I take in his too, for your sake.
('55', 361, 3, 16, 681561) This is an instance not of special love for an individual, but of non violence.
('55', 361, 3, 17, 681641) If we bear love for one person so that we feel aversion to others or cannot love them, then that would be an instance of special love.
('55', 361, 3, 18, 681776) I believe that I bear no such love for any person.
('55', 361, 3, 19, 681827) I do all that I do for you because I think you require such attention from me, because you expect it and because I believe it is in my interest to do so for I expect much from you.
('55', 361, 3, 20, 682008) If you see practical shrewdness behind this attitude, I would not quarrel with you.
('55', 361, 3, 21, 682092) Personally I think this is the mark of a non violent nature.
('55', 361, 3, 22, 682153) I hope you have not forgotten about the Urdu books.
('55', 361, 3, 23, 682205) If all the people have decided to leave the Ashram at the same time, I do not approve of that.
('55', 361, 3, 24, 682300) But now the Ashram has been in existence for so long that I would not argue about any matter nor complain against anything connected with it.
('55', 361, 3, 25, 682442) Realizing that something is wrong somewhere, I try to get things right whenever such an occasion arises, and dissuade people from leaving it if I can do so without much trouble.
('55', 361, 3, 26, 682620) If the Ashram is likely to be deserted completely and if you can stay behind cheerfully, do so, and leave when other workers return.
('55', 361, 3, 27, 682753) However, it is for Narandas and you to decide what is the right course for you to adopt.
('55', 361, 3, 28, 682842) How can I judge from here?

('55', 362, 1, 2, 682959) May 12, 1932
('55', 362, 2, 3, 682972) I send with this an article by Montessori in the weekly Hindu.
('55', 362, 2, 4, 683035) Mahadev liked it and so I asked him to take out the cutting.
('55', 362, 2, 5, 683096) Read it.
('55', 362, 2, 6, 683105) See if you find anything in it worth accepting.
('55', 362, 2, 7, 683153) Otherwise throw it away.
('55', 362, 2, 8, 683178) Sushila will be permitted to see me.
('55', 362, 2, 9, 683215) If, therefore, you wish to bring her along when you come, you may do so.
('55', 362, 2, 10, 683288) I did not intentionally leave any of your questions unanswered.
('55', 362, 2, 11, 683352) I still cannot recollect which question I left unanswered.
('55', 362, 2, 12, 683411) If you ask it again, I will reply to it.
('55', 362, 2, 13, 683452) The problem about the type of education imparted in the Ashram is an old one.
('55', 362, 2, 14, 683530) I dont think it is proper to make any comparison with a boarding school.
('55', 362, 2, 15, 683603) The whole burden is borne by Narandas, and he may, therefore, act as he thinks best.
('55', 362, 2, 16, 683688) You can help him in arriving at a decision.
('55', 362, 2, 17, 683732) Personally, I would apply one rule, namely, that the proposal should appeal to the children.
('55', 362, 2, 18, 683825) Everything which they do unwillingly will fail in its aim and will have helped in perpetuating the tradition of compulsion.
('55', 362, 2, 19, 683949) We can stop observing holidays if and only if the children welcome the idea.
('55', 362, 2, 20, 684026) I will not pass judgment about anything which you did in the Ashram school.
('55', 362, 2, 21, 684102) If I were there, I would certainly interfere from time to time, but I will say nothing from here.
('55', 362, 2, 22, 684200) As you follow the practice of self examination, you will correct yourself whenever you go wrong.
('55', 362, 2, 23, 684297) I dont know if I had tried to teach you knowledge of the Brahman, but in any case you betrayed your ignorance by claiming that you had it.
('55', 362, 2, 24, 684436) The arguments which you went on to advance serve only to prove your ignorance.
('55', 362, 2, 25, 684515) An intellectual understanding of the concept of the Brahman does not amount to a knowledge of It.
('55', 362, 2, 26, 684613) Knowledge of the Brahman awakens in the heart.
('55', 362, 2, 27, 684660) And it is not true that one who has attained to that state renounces all external activity.
('55', 362, 2, 28, 684752) Outwardly, the spiritually awakened man and the ignorant may look alike, but the motives which inspire their activities are as poles asunder.
('55', 362, 2, 29, 684894) Ramanama is not incompatible with knowledge of the Brahman.
('55', 362, 2, 30, 684954) They may mean the same thing.
('55', 362, 2, 31, 684984) Any person claiming knowledge of the Brahman, who feels polluted by Ramanama has fallen into the well of ignorance and is in a desperate condition.
('55', 362, 2, 32, 685132) He who merely repeats Ramanama with his lips engages in a fruitless exercise and wastes his time.
('55', 362, 2, 33, 685230) Knowledge of the Brahman and being happy in my presence are certainly not incompatible with each other;
('55', 363, 0, 1, 685334) 364 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 363, 1, 2, 685376) if, however, my absence affects your devotion to duty, you have not attained knowledge of the Brahman but are in a state of ignorance.
('55', 363, 1, 3, 685511) Anyone who claims to have such knowledge will in all probability be devoid of it.
('55', 363, 1, 4, 685593) It is a knowledge which does not speak about itselfits presence is revealed by its own light.
('55', 363, 1, 5, 685687) The sun does not have to testify to the fact of its light.
('55', 363, 1, 6, 685746) We can see that it shines.
('55', 363, 1, 7, 685773) We can say the same thing about knowledge of the Brahman.
('55', 363, 1, 8, 685831) When I had faith in British rule, I used to believe that it was for the ultimate good of the country, that it was inspired by noble motives.
('55', 363, 1, 9, 685972) But I cannot discuss this question further.
('55', 363, 1, 10, 686016) I do not like the literature on sex that is being published in America.
('55', 363, 2, 11, 686088) BAPU [PS.] I do intend to write about it.
('55', 363, 2, 12, 686130) When children ask questions, we should give them straight answers.
('55', 363, 2, 13, 686197) I dont know about the cinema, but stage performances have a place.
('55', 363, 2, 14, 686264) For realizing God, the practice of non attachment seems to me the best method.
('55', 363, 2, 15, 686343) It includes everything.

('55', 363, 7, 19, 686496) DEAR COLONEL DOYLE, I am deeply grateful to you for the prompt reply you have sent in respect of my inquiry contained in my letter 1 of the 4th instant.
('55', 363, 7, 20, 686649) The addition of three ounces of ghee to Kaka Kalelkars diet certainly meets, if I may dare to say so, the physical needs of his constitution.
('55', 363, 7, 21, 686791) The assurances contained in your letter do relieve me of considerable anxiety on the score of these friends of mine.

('55', 364, 2, 3, 687116) May 12, 1932
('55', 364, 3, 4, 687129) I got your letter.
('55', 364, 3, 5, 687148) It was a beautiful one.
('55', 364, 3, 6, 687172) My statement that Jainism puts emphasis on pure nyaya 2 has been slightly misund erstood by you.
('55', 364, 3, 7, 687269) Pure nyaya may mean right policy or just decision, and ordinarily that is the sense in which we use the word.
('55', 364, 3, 8, 687379) But I did not use it in that sense.
('55', 364, 3, 9, 687415) I wanted to say that Jainism emphasizes logic, but that logic sometimes leads to wrong conclusions the consequences of which are fearful.
('55', 364, 3, 10, 687553) This is not the fault of logic, but we do not always possess all the data necessary for arriving at a correct conclusion.
('55', 364, 3, 11, 687675) Nor is every word understood by the hearer or the reader in the same sense in which it was used by the speaker or the writer.
('55', 364, 3, 12, 687801) Hence the heart, that is bhakti, faith and first hand experience, is given a higher place than logic.
('55', 364, 3, 13, 687903) Logic is a purely intellectual process.
('55', 364, 3, 14, 687943) We should not care in the least if logic, that is intellect, cannot understand what is self evident to the heart.
('55', 364, 3, 15, 688057) On the contrary, sometimes our intellect is convinced of certain ideas which the heart does not accept.
('55', 364, 3, 16, 688161) We should, then, reject them.
('55', 364, 3, 17, 688191) You will be able to think of any number of illustrations which will explain my point.
('55', 364, 3, 18, 688277) In the sense in which I have used the word nyaya above, it can never be an end in itself.
('55', 364, 3, 19, 688367) Both nyaya and the yoga of desireless work are means.
('55', 364, 3, 20, 688421) The former belongs to the sphere of the intellect, the latter is a matter of the heart.
('55', 364, 3, 21, 688509) We cannot cultivate desirelessness with the help of the intellect.
('55', 364, 4, 22, 688576) Now I will deal with the issue which you have raised.
('55', 364, 4, 23, 688630) Compassion and ahimsa are not two different things.
('55', 364, 4, 24, 688682) Compassion is not opposed to ahimsa.
('55', 364, 4, 25, 688719) Anything which is so opposed is not true compassion.
('55', 364, 4, 26, 688772) We can describe compassion as the concrete expression of ahimsa.
('55', 364, 4, 27, 688837) It is a contradiction in terms to describe any man as free from attachment and without compassion.
('55', 364, 4, 28, 688936) A person who is free from attachment should have a compassionate heart as large as the ocean.
('55', 364, 5, 29, 689030) 1 Who wrote that according to the Jains even compassion is included in attachment (raga), albeit a desirable one, and therefore Bapus action in putting an ailing calf out of pain was not worthy of vitaraga (one who is free from attachment) (The Diary of Mahadev Desai, Vol. I, pp.
('55', 364, 5, 30, 689311) 108 9).

('55', 365, 0, 1, 689365) 366 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 365, 1, 2, 689407) And when such compassion embraces millions, to say that, though sattvik, it is not free from attachment is to betray ignorance of the meaning of the word or else to give it a new meaning.
('55', 365, 1, 3, 689595) Generally, we use the word in the sense in which Tulsidas has used it.
('55', 365, 1, 4, 689666) His meaning is clear in the following doha 1: n;k /keZ dk ewy gS iki@nsg ewy A Here, compassion is used as a synonym for ahimsa.
('55', 365, 1, 5, 689795) Perfect ahimsa is possible only in the atman in its disembodied state.
('55', 365, 1, 6, 689866) But when the atman takes on a body, ahimsa manifests itself in one as the feeling of compassion.
('55', 365, 1, 7, 689963) Considered from this point of view, my mercy killing of the calf 3 was an expression of the purest ahimsa.
('55', 365, 1, 8, 690070) To endure suffering in ones own person is the very nature of the atman, but it is contrary to its nature to make or let others suffer.
('55', 365, 1, 9, 690205) If the mercy killing of the calf had been prompted by a desire to relieve my own pain [at its suffering], the act was not ahimsa, but to end the calfs pain was ahimsa.
('55', 365, 1, 10, 690373) Indeed, ahimsa implies inability to endure other creatures suffering pain.
('55', 365, 1, 11, 690448) From such inability arise compassion, heroism and all other virtues associated with ahimsa.
('55', 365, 1, 12, 690540) It is perverse logic to argue that we should be able to look on while others suffer.
('55', 365, 1, 13, 690625) Again, it is not always true that death is more painful for human beings than anything they may suffer in life.
('55', 365, 1, 14, 690737) I think that it is we ourselves that have made death the terror it is.
('55', 365, 1, 15, 690808) The so called savages do not have the same fear of death.
('55', 365, 1, 16, 690866) The martial races also have very little of it.
('55', 365, 1, 17, 690913) And in the West a school of thought is spreading whose followers would prefer to end their lives rather than go on living in extreme pain.
('55', 365, 1, 18, 691052) I think that the assumption of excessive fear of death proceeds from ignorance or dry theorizing.
('55', 365, 1, 19, 691150) Because of that assumption, we, and especially the Jains, have perverted the meaning of ahimsa, with the result that true ahimsa has practically disappeared.
('55', 365, 1, 20, 691308) A woman who jumps into a well in anger may clutch at a rope offered to her, but one who has jumped into it deliberately under the force of some belief, whatever it be, will disdain to avail herself of a rope even if offered to her.
('55', 365, 1, 21, 691540) The practice of harakiri among the Japanese is a well known example of this.
('55', 365, 1, 22, 691617) Whether that practice is the result of right knowledge or ignorance is beside the point.
('55', 365, 1, 23, 691706) Here I am only pointing out that there are countless instances in which men prefer death to life.
('55', 365, 1, 24, 691804) In the West they kill animals whose condition is hopeless and who suffer extreme pain, and behind this
('55', 365, 2, 25, 691907) 1 Couplet 2 Compassion is the source of dharma and pride is the source of sin (or, the ego is the cause of the body).
('55', 366, 0, 1, 692025) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 367
('55', 366, 1, 2, 692071) practice lies the belief that they do not experience much fear of death, and that they will prefer death to suffering pain beyond a certain limit.
('55', 366, 1, 3, 692218) This idea may not be true, and it is, therefore, our duty to behave towards animals as if life was as dear to them as it is to human beings.
('55', 366, 2, 4, 692359) If you accept so much, it is not very necessary to consider the matter from a social point of view or from the point of view of our duty towards society.
('55', 366, 2, 5, 692513) Where the people have regard for ahimsa, there is little risk of the example of my killing the calf being misused.
('55', 366, 2, 6, 692628) Where people have no such regard, in any case animals are killed.
('55', 366, 2, 7, 692694) Thus, my action is not likely to increase violence to animals.
('55', 366, 2, 8, 692757) When killing the calf, it was not necessary for me to know all the possible consequences of my action.
('55', 366, 2, 9, 692860) If it was certain that the calf would never die in any other manner, I should of course have paused before killing it.
('55', 366, 2, 10, 692979) In other words, if it were the case that nobody but I could have ended the calfs life, it would have been necessary for me to think of all the possible consequences of my action.
('55', 366, 2, 11, 693158) But the fact is that all creatures, calves as much as we, live with the possibility of death always hanging over us.
('55', 366, 2, 12, 693275) Therefore, the utmost that could have happened was that the calf would have lived for a few days or months or a year more.
('55', 366, 2, 13, 693398) These considerations are not irrelevant to the case, since my motive was disinterested and my only aim was to end the pain of the calf.
('55', 366, 2, 14, 693534) We may, therefore, say that even if there was any error in my reasoning, no harmful consequence to the calf followed which would never have followed but for my action.
('55', 366, 2, 15, 693702) 1 Ask me again and again till you have understood the point.
('55', 366, 2, 16, 693763) The subject is an important one and the explanation deserves to be carefully grasped.
('55', 366, 2, 17, 693849) It is easy to grasp, and once it is grasped you will be able to deduce many other consequences from it.
('55', 366, 3, 18, 693953) It is undoubtedly true that my approach to the problem attacks certain generally accepted beliefs.
('55', 366, 3, 19, 694052) But I do believe that we, that is Hindus, have become so full of cowardice and inertia that the true essence of ahimsa is forgotten and the thing has come to be identified with superficial concern for the lives of lower creatures.
('55', 366, 3, 20, 694283) In its essence, ahimsa is a powerful emotion of the heart which finds expression in numerous forms of service.
('55', 366, 3, 21, 694394) If it manifests itself in its perfection even

('55', 367, 11, 15, 695057) MIRA, In the hope that you would get this on or before Monday, I write in reply to your unexpected letter received today.
('55', 367, 11, 16, 695179) It is well if you do without the fountain pen.
('55', 367, 11, 17, 695226) But what we must aim at is the correct attitude.
('55', 367, 11, 18, 695275) This brings about lasting and drastic changes.
('55', 367, 11, 19, 695322) A detailed local treatment must go hand in hand with a penetrating search after the root cause, the desire to possess.
('55', 367, 11, 20, 695441) It is possible to conceive a person not being poor in spirit though he may
('55', 367, 12, 21, 695516) 1 Mahadev Desai explains: While the above was being dictated, we had a discussion about the two readings in Tulsidass verse: Bapu said, I have heard both of them, but I prefer to read deha (body). I remarked that the Vedantic idea that pride is the root of the body did not fit in well here.
('55', 367, 12, 22, 695808) Perhaps the poet wanted to say that mercy is the root of religion and pride is the root of sin.
('55', 367, 12, 23, 695904) Bapu said, If we read deha, he means that the body being the root of pride is an obstacle in the way of mercy.
('55', 367, 12, 24, 696015) But to spend ourselves to the uttermost in service is purest mercy.
('55', 367, 12, 25, 696083) This mercy should be cherished as long as we live. I objected that that was so but it was not what the poet meant to say.
('55', 367, 12, 26, 696205) Again Bapus interpretation was too subtle for the common man, while he could easily understand that pride is the root of sin.
('55', 367, 12, 27, 696331) In any case, the latter half of the verse had nothing to do with the subject matter of the letter. (The Diary of Mahadev Desai, Vol. I, p.

('55', 368, 1, 3, 696574) He has nothing, but feels the deprivation.
('55', 368, 1, 4, 696617) Another may have by him a golden footstool which he is seen using in order to save his feet from treading on hot ashes, but which he converts into cash for the poor the very next moment and feels the delight of dispossession.
('55', 368, 1, 5, 696843) This is not to criticize what you have done but to enforce it, if it is at all necessary or possible.
('55', 368, 1, 6, 696945) You will come as soon as you can, bringing with you anyone who may wish to come and who is permitted to come.
('55', 368, 1, 7, 697055) Pyare Ali and Noorbanu can come.
('55', 368, 1, 8, 697088) Not yet Damodardas whose name is still under consideration.
('55', 368, 1, 9, 697148) You should go to Pyare Alis place and there see Aminas children and Tilak.
('55', 368, 1, 10, 697223) Of course, Tilak can come if he wants to.
('55', 368, 1, 11, 697265) There is immediately the question of poverty.
('55', 368, 1, 12, 697311) But I would not bring it up in his case if he has a desire he cannot restrain.
('55', 368, 1, 13, 697390) Your left hand writing is certainly steadier than mine.
('55', 368, 1, 14, 697446) You will, in a short time, write as well with the left as you do with the right hand.
('55', 368, 1, 15, 697532) I am delighted Sofia is with you.
('55', 368, 1, 16, 697566) I have met her.
('55', 368, 1, 17, 697582) It is just like her to join you in prayer so heartily.
('55', 368, 1, 18, 697637) Give her my love.
('55', 368, 1, 19, 697655) I would almost wish for her sake that she had you longer than you would be.
('55', 368, 1, 20, 697731) Let her write to me if ever she has a month when she has nobody else in particular to write to.
('55', 368, 1, 21, 697827) That could not be I am sure.
('55', 368, 1, 22, 697856) But who can say?
('55', 368, 1, 23, 697873) Magan wheel has caused me trouble, but I am gaining mastery over it.
('55', 368, 1, 24, 697942) Ground nuts are gone.

('55', 368, 6, 32, 698214) Sometimes a lesson in even an ordinary school reader teaches us a great moral.
('55', 368, 6, 33, 698293) Recently I have been reading an Urdu reader.
('55', 368, 6, 34, 698338) Some of the lessons in it are very good.
('55', 368, 6, 35, 698379) One of them produced a profound effect on me.

('55', 369, 0, 1, 698585) 370 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 369, 1, 2, 698627) give here a summary.
('55', 369, 1, 3, 698648) A few years after the death of the Prophet, there was a great battle between the Arabs and the Romans.
('55', 369, 1, 4, 698751) On both sides large numbers of warriors were killed and a great many wounded.
('55', 369, 1, 5, 698829) Every evening the fighting would stop.
('55', 369, 1, 6, 698868) One evening after the fighting had ended an Arab warrior went round the battlefield to find his cousin.
('55', 369, 1, 7, 698972) If he found the cousin dead, he would bury the body, and if he found him alive he would treat his wounds.
('55', 369, 1, 8, 699078) Thinking that the cousin might be thirsting for water, this Arab carried a jug full of water.
('55', 369, 1, 9, 699172) As, with lamp in hand, he made his way through the bodies of warriors Iying wounded and crying in pain, he found his cousin and indeed he was thirsting for water.
('55', 369, 1, 10, 699335) His wounds were bleeding profusely.
('55', 369, 1, 11, 699371) There was little hope of his remaining alive.
('55', 369, 1, 12, 699417) The Arab held out the jug of water before him.
('55', 369, 1, 13, 699464) Just then they heard a wounded warrior crying pitifully for water.
('55', 369, 1, 14, 699531) The cousin felt compassion for that man and asked the Arab to go first to him and give him water.
('55', 369, 1, 15, 699629) The latter immediately went in the direction from which they had heard the cry.
('55', 369, 1, 16, 699709) This wounded man crying for water was a big chieftain.
('55', 369, 1, 17, 699764) As he was about to take the jug of water from the Arab, they heard somebody else crying for water.
('55', 369, 1, 18, 699863) This chieftain, like the Arabs cousin, was a man of compassion.
('55', 369, 1, 19, 699927) With great difficulty, he uttered a few words and made gestures to the Arab and explained to him that he should first go to that other person and, give him water.
('55', 369, 1, 20, 700090) Feeling miserable, the Arab ran to the place from which the cries had come.
('55', 369, 1, 21, 700166) But the moment he reached there, the wounded warrior breathed his last and closed his eyes.
('55', 369, 1, 22, 700258) The water had arrived too late.
('55', 369, 1, 23, 700290) The Arab quickly returned to where the wounded chieftain was lying.
('55', 369, 1, 24, 700358) He found that the chieftain, too, was dead.
('55', 369, 1, 25, 700402) With a heavy heart and praying to God, the Arab went back to where his cousin lay, and found that his pulse, too, had stopped and he had died.
('55', 369, 1, 26, 700545) Thus, none of the three got water.
('55', 369, 1, 27, 700580) But the first two won immortal fame.
('55', 369, 1, 28, 700617) The pages of history abound in such instances of pure self sacrifice, and, if they are narrated by a master of the pen, we even shed a few tears over them.
('55', 369, 1, 29, 700773) But I have narrated this wonderful story here with the hope that it may inspire in us the spirit of self sacrifice displayed by those two brave warriors and that, when such occasions arise, we will give water first to others before drinking it ourselves, will save others lives before saving our own and if, in trying to do so, we meet death, we will meet it with a smile on our face.
('55', 370, 0, 1, 701158) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 371
('55', 370, 1, 2, 701204) I think even more difficult than the sacrifice of water is that of air.
('55', 370, 1, 3, 701276) Without it we cannot live even for a minute.
('55', 370, 1, 4, 701321) That is why the whole world seems to have been filled with air.
('55', 370, 1, 5, 701385) However, it does sometimes happen that men are locked up in a small room as in a cupboard.
('55', 370, 1, 6, 701476) There is only one small hole letting in air, and only those who get this air are likely to survive and the others would die.
('55', 370, 1, 7, 701601) We should pray to God that if ever we found ourselves in such a condition we would voluntarily give up our place near the hole.
('55', 370, 1, 8, 701729) Next to air comes water.
('55', 370, 1, 9, 701754) We occasionally hear of men fighting for a glass of water.
('55', 370, 1, 10, 701813) We should hope that if we find ourselves in such circumstances, we will have the spirit of self sacrifice displayed by those brave Arabs.
('55', 370, 1, 11, 701951) But very few people are tested in this manner.
('55', 370, 1, 12, 701998) There are less severe tests which we face almost every day.
('55', 370, 1, 13, 702058) Let all of us ask ourselves: Whenever we are confronted by such tests, do we always put our co workers and neighbours before ourselves?
('55', 370, 1, 14, 702194) If the answer is in the negative, then it means that we have failed in the test and that we have not learnt even the first lesson in non violence.

('55', 370, 4, 17, 702416) [May 13/15, 1932] 1
('55', 370, 5, 18, 702436) NARANDAS, I received two packets from you this time.
('55', 370, 5, 19, 702489) I follow your argument that yarn of 16 counts will be cheaper than that of 20 counts.
('55', 370, 5, 20, 702575) But I think we shall find that on the balance yarn of 20 counts is cheaper, for in spinning such yarn we shall have to remain vigilant all the time.
('55', 370, 5, 21, 702724) The spindle, etc., will have to be kept in good condition.
('55', 370, 5, 22, 702783) By cheap I do not mean here merely economical.
('55', 370, 5, 23, 702830) I give to the word a spiritual sense.
('55', 370, 5, 24, 702868) If, therefore, you see no other difficulty, insist on everybody spinning yarn of 20 counts and do it yourself, and see that the other conditions are also observed.
('55', 370, 5, 25, 703032) If you find that this results in decrease in production for the time being, never mind.
('55', 370, 5, 26, 703120) Probably you remember one thing which I suggested to you once or twice.
('55', 370, 5, 27, 703192) We should reckon the value of all types of work at the same rate.
('55', 370, 5, 28, 703258) In other words, if a person works for one hour, whether he spins or cards or weaves or does carpentry work or writes accounts or works on the

('55', 371, 0, 1, 703458) 372 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 371, 1, 2, 703500) farm, the value of his work should be the same.
('55', 371, 1, 3, 703548) For the purpose of our record, I had suggested that the value should be one anna per hour of work.
('55', 371, 1, 4, 703647) If all inmates of the Ashram above the age of ten, other than those who may be bedridden, have been working daily for an average of eight hours, I would say that the Ashram was self supporting.
('55', 371, 1, 5, 703841) This may seem just now to entail loss from the economic point of view, but ultimately the account will balance itself even from that point of view.
('55', 371, 1, 6, 703989) Of course, in proceeding on this basis we assume that all inmates have been honest.
('55', 371, 1, 7, 704073) Everybody must have used the time honestly.
('55', 371, 1, 8, 704117) To make sure of this, we should have considered, when making the entry, whether the person had done as much work per hour as everybody doing that work was expected to do, and whether he had done it with proper care.
('55', 371, 1, 9, 704333) I did not suggest that this record should take the place of the usual account that is kept.
('55', 371, 1, 10, 704425) It does not require too many entries.
('55', 371, 1, 11, 704463) The daily figure will be entered against everybodys name; it may be one in some cases and two in others, and the figures will indicate the number of hours for which the person had worked.
('55', 371, 1, 12, 704651) The figures will be entered only against those who pass the test in our eyes.
('55', 371, 1, 13, 704729) I would call this a spiritual account.
('55', 371, 1, 14, 704768) If we work in this manner, whatever the yield of our farm and our dairy I wouId describe those activities as self supporting.
('55', 371, 1, 15, 704894) Moreover, this plan assumes that the labourers will be as good as inmates of the Ashram and that we shall be satisfied with the vegetables, fruit and milk which we produce in the Ashram.
('55', 371, 1, 16, 705081) These ideas have not sprung up in my mind recently.
('55', 371, 1, 17, 705133) I have been discussing them ever since the establishment of the Ashram.
('55', 371, 1, 18, 705205) I may not have discussed them at length with you, but I used to discuss them frequently with Maganlal.
('55', 371, 1, 19, 705308) But till now they have remained as mere wishes.
('55', 371, 1, 20, 705356) I am simply pouring out before you the stream of thoughts which started with reflections on the spinning yajna during the National Week.
('55', 371, 1, 21, 705493) I do not wish that you should start implementing these suggestions right now.
('55', 371, 1, 22, 705571) You are a steady man, and, therefore, I do not hesitate to put before you whatever ideas come to me.
('55', 371, 1, 23, 705672) I dont wish to confuse your mind in any way or start you worrying needlessly.
('55', 371, 1, 24, 705750) There are persons who become impatient as soon as a new suggestion is put before them, immediately start implementing it and, failing in their attempt, get confused.
('55', 371, 1, 25, 705916) In the result they will have given up the old practice but discovered nothing to take its place.
('55', 371, 1, 26, 706013) I believe you do not have this weakness in your nature and that is why I throw out to you every new fancy which occurs to me.
('55', 371, 1, 27, 706139) When you are fed up with this, please drop a hint and I
('55', 372, 0, 1, 706195) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 373
('55', 372, 1, 2, 706241) shall calm down.
('55', 372, 1, 3, 706258) From here I can give you no active help in your work, but within my limits I can help you with suggestions.
('55', 372, 1, 4, 706366) But this help also I can give only if you receive the suggestions patiently, put each in the proper cabinet in your brain and weigh its practicability before acting on it.
('55', 372, 1, 5, 706538) If, however, they become a burden on your brain, my sending them will serve no useful purpose.
('55', 372, 1, 6, 706633) Let me return for a while to the question of 20 counts.
('55', 372, 1, 7, 706689) It is not quite correct that cloth woven from yarn of 16 counts lasts longer than cloth woven from yarn of 20 counts.
('55', 372, 1, 8, 706807) If the cotton from which the yarn of 20 counts was woven was of suffciently good quality and was properly carded, and if the yarn spun from it was strong enough and the weaving was sufficiently close, the cloth would certainly last longer than the cloth of 16 counts which we have with us now.
('55', 372, 1, 9, 707101) The fact that the latter lasts longer only means this: Both the varieties of yarn which we spin, 16 counts and 20 counts, are weak.
('55', 372, 1, 10, 707233) But the yarn of 16 counts is likely to be less weak comparatively, and such yarn can be spun even from cotton of inferior quality without its quality being affected.
('55', 372, 1, 11, 707399) Hence the cloth woven from it may appear stronger than the cloth woven from the yarn of 20 counts.
('55', 372, 1, 12, 707498) If we cling to this belief, we shall be responsible for spreading the notion that cloth woven from yarn of 16 counts is stronger than cloth from yarn of 20 counts, and, if my argument about yarn of 20 counts is correct, we shall also be responsible for encouraging work of bad quality.
('55', 372, 1, 13, 707784) Up to a limit, the finer the count of the yarn which we are able to spin the better shall we be able to serve the poor, because that will raise the prestige of khadi.
('55', 372, 1, 14, 707951) I think we shall be able to demonstrate that it is not difficult to spin fine yarn which can be used for weaving cloth.
('55', 372, 1, 15, 708071) Just now I give all my attention to learning to spin on the Magan spinning wheel.
('55', 372, 1, 16, 708153) But Mahadev has been experimenting with the slivers sent by Chhakkaddas.
('55', 372, 1, 17, 708226) He has made some changes in the spindle bearer, and these changes by themselves have enabled him to spin without any difficulty yarn of 36 counts from the slivers which he has been using all along.
('55', 372, 1, 18, 708424) Previously he could spin yarn of 20 counts, then of 25 counts and now he can spin yarn of 36 counts.
('55', 372, 1, 19, 708525) In the letter which I wrote to Lakshmidas yesterday I have explained how this improvement took place.
('55', 372, 1, 20, 708627) Get that letter from him and read it.
('55', 372, 1, 21, 708665) It is true, however, that Mahadevs speed has decreased a little.
('55', 372, 1, 22, 708730) When he was spinning yarn of 25 counts, his speed was 300 rounds per hour; it
('55', 373, 0, 1, 708808) 374 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 373, 1, 2, 708850) was 240 when the yarn was of 32 counts, and now for yarn of 36 counts it is 210 rounds per hour.
('55', 373, 1, 3, 708947) This decrease does not alarm me in the least.
('55', 373, 1, 4, 708993) When the count of the yarn becomes fixed, I am sure his speed will increase a little.
('55', 373, 1, 5, 709079) My point is that by gradually learning to spin yarn of finer count, we are helping the cause of khadi.
('55', 373, 1, 6, 709182) It seems you celebrated Maganlals anniversary in a most befitting manner.
('55', 373, 1, 7, 709256) Panditji, Lakshmibehn, Yashvant Prasad and Mathuri came and saw me.
('55', 373, 1, 8, 709324) Manibehn was the oldest among the party, and hence I gave the letter to Harilal to her.
('55', 373, 1, 9, 709412) While giving it I asked her and was told that all of them would return to the Ashram on the same day.
('55', 373, 1, 10, 709514) Isent the letter with her, thinking that it would reach you earlier than by post.
('55', 373, 1, 11, 709596) I feel helpless.
('55', 373, 1, 12, 709613) I got one more letter from Harilal.
('55', 373, 1, 13, 709649) In both letters I see pure insolence and total lack of shame.
('55', 373, 1, 14, 709711) I dont see in Bali the faults for which he blames her.
('55', 373, 1, 15, 709766) She has been like a mother to Manu, and, therefore, it would be a cruelty on Manu to remove her from her charge.
('55', 373, 1, 16, 709879) However, I cannot have in prison the information which you may get there.
('55', 373, 1, 17, 709953) After knowing my views, therefore, do what seems best to you whenever you have to decide what to do.
('55', 373, 1, 18, 710054) There is no cause for worry about my hand.
('55', 373, 1, 19, 710097) It pains when I work, but not at other times.
('55', 373, 1, 20, 710143) If I feel that milk will help to cure the pain, I will certainly start taking it.
('55', 373, 1, 21, 710225) The pain was there even when I used to take milk.
('55', 373, 1, 22, 710275) I see that Ratilal is a heavy responsibility on you.
('55', 373, 1, 23, 710328) I have had two letters from Champa.
('55', 373, 1, 24, 710364) She seems to have felt hurt for some reason.
('55', 373, 1, 25, 710409) See what you can do to pacify her.
('55', 373, 1, 26, 710444) She says that her younger brother wants to stay in the Ashram.
('55', 373, 1, 27, 710507) If you think he can stay in the Ashram, take him in.
('55', 373, 1, 28, 710560) Write to Harihar Sharma and ask him if he will take away Ratilal.
('55', 373, 1, 29, 710626) I am afraid that even if he goes to Rangoon he will not stay there without Champa.
('55', 373, 1, 30, 710709) And the latter does not wish to go there.
('55', 373, 1, 31, 710751) I believe that she has good reasons for not wishing to go there.
('55', 373, 1, 32, 710816) Grant the permission desired by Ranganath Kulkarni to make a Marathi translation.
('55', 373, 1, 33, 710898) None of the papers sent by Jethalal Govindji were reports about Anantpur.
('55', 373, 1, 34, 710972) But I did get one letter from him.
('55', 373, 1, 35, 711007) The prison authorities tell me that the reports must have been received, but that they seem to have been misplaced.
('55', 373, 1, 36, 711123) Please, therefore, obtain their copies from him.
('55', 373, 1, 37, 711172) There is probably much exaggeration in the complaint you have received regarding the women.
('55', 373, 1, 38, 711264) I will, however, inquire about the matter.
('55', 373, 1, 39, 711307) I sent to you the five names of intending visitors which were
('55', 374, 0, 1, 711369) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 375
('55', 374, 1, 2, 711415) approved.
('55', 374, 1, 3, 711425) The other names which have been approved are as under: Indu Nehru, Jehangir Vakil (of Poona, Indus tutor) and his wife, Hemprabha Devi, Raihana, Hiravanti Mansukh lal, Chhaganlal, Rama (Ranchhodbhais) Prabhashankar (Champas father), Behram Khambhatta and his wife, Manjukesha, Sushila (Pyarelals sister), Sushila (Premabehns friend), Dinkar Mehta, Puratan Buch.
('55', 374, 1, 4, 711787) You need not write to them.
('55', 374, 1, 5, 711815) If Puratan comes to the Ashram any time, you can tell him that he may come whenever he wishes.
('55', 374, 1, 6, 711910) I have given the list only for your information.
('55', 374, 1, 7, 711959) If you know of any other persons who wishto visit and if they come within the conditions laid down by the Government, please send their names to me.
('55', 374, 1, 8, 712108) There is a letter from Mahavir.
('55', 374, 1, 9, 712140) He writes in it that all of them are keeping good health and that, therefore, they should be permitted to stay on for a few months more.
('55', 374, 1, 10, 712277) I think that they may be permitted to stay on.
('55', 374, 1, 11, 712324) It would be advisable to fix the upper limit of their expenditure.
('55', 374, 1, 12, 712391) I should like them to take up some work in Darjeeling.
('55', 374, 1, 13, 712446) If you can think of any, please suggest it.
('55', 374, 1, 14, 712490) I think you did write to me and tell me what their monthly expenditure was, but I have forgotten the figure.
('55', 374, 1, 15, 712599) I think it would be good if they marry Maitri to someone in Darjeeling.
('55', 374, 1, 16, 712671) She has certainly reached marriageable age.
('55', 374, 1, 17, 712715) They wished to get her married to Khadgabahadur.
('55', 374, 1, 18, 712764) But I dont think he will agree.
('55', 374, 1, 19, 712796) I have written directly to Maitri about this.
('55', 374, 1, 20, 712842) Read that letter.
('55', 374, 1, 21, 712860) If in the end they decide to stay permanently in Darjeeling and Mahavir starts earning, that would certainly be good.
('55', 374, 1, 22, 712978) If you have thought about any suggestions in this regard or if any suggestion occurs to you in future, please let me know.
('55', 374, 1, 23, 713101) Ramdas writes and tells me that he has deposited some of his money in a certain bank and he wants the amount to remain where it is.
('55', 374, 1, 24, 713233) I heard that Gopaldas 1, the Vidyapith graduate, has received serious injuries.
('55', 374, 1, 25, 713313) Inquire about him and let me know the facts.
('55', 374, 1, 26, 713358) If he is able to write, ask him to do so.
('55', 374, 1, 27, 713400) Ask Chandrashankar to send me by registered post a copy of Maganbhais Mimansa 2. He should also write how he keeps.
('55', 374, 1, 28, 713516) Did Ba get my letter?
('55', 374, 1, 29, 713538) I have had no letter from her at all.
('55', 374, 1, 30, 713576) Did you read what Jamnadas said about Harilal?
('55', 374, 1, 31, 713623) I am afraid the latter has misled you.
('55', 374, 1, 32, 713662) Many persons write to me and tell me that he has abandoned all restraints.
('55', 374, 1, 33, 713737) Haridas Gandhis 3 health is fairly good.

('55', 375, 6, 10, 714375) According to me, the most important benefit of your going there 1 will be improvement in your health and the good and bad experiences which you will get there.
('55', 375, 6, 11, 714535) It will certainly be very good if you attain great proficiency in your medical studies, but see that you do not harm your health or let go opportunities for other experiences for the sake of your studies.
('55', 375, 6, 12, 714740) Since you will have to study German, learn it sufficiently well to be able to read and understand German literature without difficulty.
('55', 375, 6, 13, 714876) And you should be careful to create a good impression on the people about you, that is, about India.

('55', 376, 7, 16, 716142) You can write even your most secret thoughts.
('55', 376, 7, 17, 716188) Nothing concerning ourselves need be kept secret from other people, and you should not, therefore, worry who will read your diary.
('55', 376, 7, 18, 716319) For that reason, however, you cannot record others short comings or what anybody may have told you in confidence.
('55', 376, 7, 19, 716433) Only the secretary of the Ashram or a person authorized by him has the right to read anybodys diary.
('55', 376, 7, 20, 716534) But, on our part, we should not wish our diary to be kept secret from any person.
('55', 376, 7, 21, 716616) You should not in any circumstances stop spinning on the takli and be out of practice, no matter even if you can give to it only half an hour every day.
('55', 376, 7, 22, 716769) Have you become methodical now?

('55', 377, 6, 12, 717670) I do not understand how you can say that you have been waiting for a letter from me, having written to everybody earlier to say that you were starting today.
('55', 377, 6, 13, 717828) If now you do not get a letter, you may complain.
('55', 377, 6, 14, 717878) I am glad that you have decided to stay there for the sake of Sita.
('55', 377, 6, 15, 717946) I also did think sometimes whether it would be good for you and her to come over.

('55', 379, 3, 5, 720122) I received another copy of Saket with your annotations.
('55', 379, 3, 6, 720178) The notes will be of great help to me.

('55', 379, 3, 8, 720266) The Kalyan office might possibly send me one.
('55', 379, 3, 9, 720312) Anyhow, I shall manage well enough with your notes and the dictionary.
('55', 379, 3, 10, 720383) This correspondence about Saket cannot be made public for the present.
('55', 379, 3, 11, 720454) The condition that no letters of mine will be published during my incarceration is implied in the permission for writing letters granted to me.
('55', 379, 3, 12, 720598) And there is no harm in keeping this correspondence unpublished for some time.
('55', 379, 3, 13, 720677) The inherent strength of Saket will by itself push it ahead.
('55', 379, 3, 14, 720738) Mahadev had an experience of your affection, I was extremely delighted to hear the whole account from him.

('55', 380, 1, 4, 721698) The daily reading of the Gita you find uninteresting because probably you do not reflect over what you read.
('55', 380, 1, 5, 721807) If you look upon the Gita as our mother who guides us daily in our life, you will not find its reading uninteresting.
('55', 380, 1, 6, 721925) After the reading every day, you should reflect for a minute over what you have read.
('55', 380, 1, 7, 722011) You will daily learn something new.
('55', 380, 1, 8, 722047) Only a perfect man will have no more to learn from it.
('55', 380, 1, 9, 722102) But the ordinary man who commits some error or other every day will not weary of reading the Gita if he looks upon it as the mother who will save him from his faults.

('55', 380, 4, 13, 722362) JAMNADAS, I have heard from you after a long time.
('55', 380, 4, 14, 722413) I of course had learnt the fact of Harilals beastly behaviour, but wanted to know the details from you as I did not depend in any way upon what Anandilal had written to me.
('55', 380, 4, 15, 722586) What are your grounds for saying that I deliberately remain silent on the subject of Harilals vices?
('55', 380, 4, 16, 722687) I have never concealed my disapproval.
('55', 380, 4, 17, 722726) I express it whenever anybody gives him something.
('55', 380, 4, 18, 722777) What more do you desire or suggest that I should do?
('55', 380, 4, 19, 722830) Of course I wrote to him and told him that I still cherished the hope that he would repent.
('55', 380, 4, 20, 722922) 1 That has happened in the case of many.
('55', 380, 4, 21, 722963) As long as a person is alive, we must continue to hope that he will reform.
('55', 380, 4, 22, 723039) Let me have more information about the school.
('55', 380, 4, 23, 723086) You should not lose self confidence and give up the work you have undertaken.
('55', 380, 4, 24, 723164) According to me, it is only there that your health will improve.
('55', 380, 4, 25, 723229) Howdo you find the atmosphere there?
('55', 380, 4, 26, 723266) Is the State being ruled well?

('55', 381, 2, 3, 723461) May 16, 1932 Even if your mind wanders when praying, you should keep up the practice.
('55', 381, 2, 4, 723547) You should retire to a secluded spot, sit in the correct posture and try to keep out all thoughts.
('55', 381, 2, 5, 723646) Even if they continue to come, you should nevertheless complete the prayer.
('55', 381, 2, 6, 723722) Gradually the mind will come under control.
('55', 381, 2, 7, 723766) The Gita also says that the mind is restless, but it tells us that with patient effort we can bring it under control.
('55', 381, 2, 8, 723884) We shall never willingly accept defeat, though we lose our life in the struggIe.

('55', 382, 3, 10, 725349) Are you referring to the letters which I dictated to you?
('55', 382, 3, 11, 725407) If that is so, when some day a collection of letters dictated to various persons is published, those dictated to you will also be included in it.
('55', 382, 3, 12, 725553) Is there any special reason for publishing the latter separately?

('55', 382, 9, 20, 725913) BHAISHRI FULCHAND, All of us were glad to receive your letter.
('55', 382, 9, 21, 725976) We need not worry over such incidents.
('55', 382, 9, 22, 726015) 1 After all we are prisoners, and should be content with whatever facilities we are allowed.
('55', 382, 9, 23, 726108) Time was when prisoners were not permitted either to read or write, were not even given sufficient food to eat, were kept in fetters all the twenty four hours and made to sleep on straw.
('55', 382, 9, 24, 726295) We should, therefore, think it Gods kindness that we get the facilities which we do.
('55', 382, 9, 25, 726380) When our self respect is attacked, we may lay down our lives to save it, but we should endure physical suffering.
('55', 382, 10, 26, 726494) 1 This sentence is reproduced from a fragment of the letter in Mahadevbhaini Diary, Vol. I, p.

('55', 383, 1, 2, 726758) We were happy to learn that all of you were happy there.
('55', 383, 1, 3, 726815) After all, happiness and unhappiness are states of ones own mind.
('55', 383, 1, 4, 726881) The fact that you and Mama obey the rules and persuade others also to obey them and to observe cleanliness does great credit to you both.
('55', 383, 1, 5, 727019) I hope that every one of you there makes the best use of his time.
('55', 383, 1, 6, 727086) You are not likely to get such quiet and leisure again in life.
('55', 383, 1, 7, 727150) You may read if you get books, and you can always think and reflect.
('55', 383, 1, 8, 727219) And there is so much work, too, from which you should volunteer to do something or the other.
('55', 383, 1, 9, 727313) There is one serious mistake which all of us commit, and it is that we waste Governments time or property as if they did not belong to us personally.
('55', 383, 1, 10, 727463) A little reflection will show that the Governments time and property belong to the people.
('55', 383, 1, 11, 727554) If we waste them because they are at present controlled by the Government, it is the peoples property and time we waste.
('55', 383, 1, 12, 727675) We should, therefore, make the best use of anything which we have occasion to use.
('55', 383, 1, 13, 727758) The goods also which we produce by our work in jail increase the nations wealth.
('55', 383, 1, 14, 727839) The fact that the present Government is foreign does not affect this argument.
('55', 383, 1, 15, 727918) But I would be entering the field of politics if I go further than this, and as prisoners we cannot discuss politics.
('55', 383, 1, 16, 728036) I, therefore, stop here on this subject.
('55', 383, 1, 17, 728077) Tell me, when you write next, who else I know are there, or somebody else whose time for exercising his right of writing a letter has come may write to me.
('55', 383, 1, 18, 728233) Is Diwan Master in that jail?
('55', 383, 1, 19, 728263) Is Madhavlal of the Ashram also there?
('55', 383, 1, 20, 728302) The three of us, it may be said, are really enjoying our time.
('55', 383, 1, 21, 728365) There are no restrictions on food except those which are self imposed, nor on the hours of rest and sleep.
('55', 383, 1, 22, 728472) Carding and spinning are going on fairly well.
('55', 383, 1, 23, 728519) And we also read.
('55', 383, 1, 24, 728537) We get a reasonable supply of newspapers too.
('55', 383, 1, 25, 728583) As for books, friends send them regularly.
('55', 383, 1, 26, 728626) We pray at regular hours.

('55', 385, 8, 15, 730944) To rise above passions is the highest ideal.

('55', 385, 8, 18, 731119) Sannyasa according to Gita is the renunciation of actions prompted by desire.

('55', 386, 3, 4, 731499) Life without a ruffle would be a very dull business.
('55', 386, 3, 5, 731552) It is not to be expected.
('55', 386, 3, 6, 731578) Therefore it is wisdom to put up with all the roughness of life, and that is one of the rich lessons we learn from the Ramayana.

('55', 386, 8, 11, 731798) I was very glad to get your letter.
('55', 386, 8, 12, 731834) Write regularly in future and give me news about Kishorelal and Gomati.
('55', 386, 8, 13, 731906) Do you ever go to see them?
('55', 386, 8, 14, 731934) Let me know Gomatis diet at present.
('55', 386, 8, 15, 731971) Who are the others there with her?
('55', 386, 8, 16, 732006) I know all those who are with Kishorelal.
('55', 386, 8, 17, 732048) I have written to Manju and advised her not to leave the hospital.
('55', 386, 8, 18, 732115) She has taken up this responsibility of her own free will.
('55', 386, 8, 19, 732174) I am of the view that she cannot give it up now without a strong reason for doing so.
('55', 386, 8, 20, 732260) What is Nathjis view?
('55', 386, 8, 21, 732282) And what do all of you think?

('55', 387, 2, 3, 732594) May 17,1932
('55', 387, 3, 4, 732606) God cannot be seen with our physical eyes.
('55', 387, 3, 5, 732649) He has no body, and, therefore, we can see Him only with the eyes of faith.
('55', 387, 3, 6, 732725) When no impure thoughts or feelings disturb us, when we feel no fear and are always serene, that is a sign of Gods presence in our heart.
('55', 387, 3, 7, 732863) In fact, He is always there, but we do not see Him because we do not have faith, and in consequence suffer in many ways.
('55', 387, 3, 8, 732984) When true faith is awakened in a person, he does not feel the outward sufferings.
('55', 387, 3, 9, 733066) This is true about Taradevi Bajpai.
('55', 387, 3, 10, 733102) She should do only as many pranayamas and in such manner as cause no physical discomfort.
('55', 387, 3, 11, 733192) I have no experience of the type of pranayamas practised in Hathayoga.
('55', 387, 3, 12, 733263) I cannot therefore guide her in this matter, nor is such pranayama necessary.
('55', 387, 3, 13, 733341) We cannot know God by performing certain physical acts.
('55', 387, 3, 14, 733397) To know Him we should have living faith and should live according to that faith.Pranayama and other processes purify the body and give us a measure of peace.

('55', 387, 6, 19, 733659) May [18] 1, 1932
('55', 387, 7, 20, 733676) DEAR COLONEL DOYLE, Major Bhandari told me today that he was instructed to prohibit Shrimati Mirabai (Slade) from seeing me should she desire to do so.
('55', 387, 7, 21, 733828) As it so happened, she having been discharged from Arthur Road Jail yesterday came today to see me.
('55', 387, 7, 22, 733928) It would have been courteous if she had been previously informed by Government that she would not be allowed to see me.
('55', 387, 7, 23, 734048) But that is perhaps a small matter.
('55', 387, 7, 24, 734084) What is of the highest concern for me is that of all the Ashram people Mirabai should be singled out for the prohibition, whereas hitherto she has never been prohibited from seeing me.
('55', 387, 7, 25, 734269) I have always been under an impression, and have been grateful, that the Government had tacitly

('55', 388, 1, 2, 734551) recognized not merely the fact of Mirabai being an inmate of the Ashram, but being nearer to me than an Ashram inmate, if such a thing was possible.
('55', 388, 1, 3, 734700) I may mention that she is under strict instructions not to take an active part in the present political movement and not deliberately to seek imprisonment.
('55', 388, 1, 4, 734856) Her activity has been confined purely to conducting the constructive khadi movement and reporting to friends in the West the present political happenings.
('55', 388, 1, 5, 735011) .If these be a disqualification, there is hardly a person whom I should be able to see.
('55', 388, 1, 6, 735099) If therefore I cannot see Mirabai, I do not know how far I would be justified in availing myself of the permission to receive other visitors.
('55', 388, 1, 7, 735241) Needless to say that I do not discuss politics with Mirabai or any other visitor, nor have I the slightest desire, even if it was possible for me, to direct the movement from within prison walls.
('55', 388, 1, 8, 735437) All interviews take place in the presence of the Superintendent.
('55', 388, 1, 9, 735502) If therefore the Government have any regard for my feelings or Mirabais, I hope that they will reconsider their decision and permit her to visit me as before.
('55', 388, 1, 10, 735661) Will you kindly place this letter before the Government and request an early decision?

('55', 388, 7, 16, 735907) I was distressed suddenly to find that you were not to see me.
('55', 388, 7, 17, 735970) My first thought was not [to] see anybody at all if I could not see you.
('55', 388, 7, 18, 736043) But I restrained myself and saw the others.
('55', 388, 7, 19, 736087) I have now written 1 to the Government asking them to reconsider their decision.
('55', 388, 7, 20, 736168) If they do not, I imagine I must cease to see others.
('55', 388, 7, 21, 736222) I have said almost as much in my letter to the Government.
('55', 388, 7, 22, 736281) It would be another matter if they had any reasonable ground for the prohibition.
('55', 388, 7, 23, 736363) Meanwhile you should write to me.
('55', 388, 7, 24, 736397) I hope this unexpected thing has not upset you.

('55', 389, 8, 16, 737069) It is a serious question now for me whether I should see other visitors.
('55', 389, 8, 17, 737142) I have written to the Government and informed it almost in so many words that, unless it reconsiders its decision, I would have to think seriously whether I should see any other visitors.
('55', 389, 8, 18, 737330) If, therefore, Premabehn, Sushila and you wish to come, you should come soon.
('55', 389, 8, 19, 737408) I may perhaps be able to see you.
('55', 389, 8, 20, 737442) If meanwhile I receive a negative reply in regard to Mirabehn, I will most probably send you a wire asking you not to come.

('55', 390, 2, 3, 737869) May 19, 1932
('55', 390, 3, 4, 737882) PREMA, Though you are likely to visit me next week, I think it best that I should reply to your letter.
('55', 390, 3, 5, 737986) Moreover, an incident which occurred yesterday shows that my receiving visitors should always be treated as uncertain.
('55', 390, 3, 6, 738105) Vali has proved her worth very well indeed.
('55', 390, 3, 7, 738149) I dont think the Ashram can take credit for that.
('55', 390, 3, 8, 738199) She seems to have joined it with her character already formed.
('55', 390, 3, 9, 738262) Why girls brought up in the Ashram seem so weak is a problem which I have not been able to solve.
('55', 390, 3, 10, 738360) I have my explanations for that, but I think it useless to discuss them unless I can give reasons in support of them.
('55', 390, 3, 11, 738478) We should try our best to discover the real reasons.
('55', 390, 3, 12, 738531) It should also be borne in mind that, after leaving the Ashram, these girls do not always improve.
('55', 390, 3, 13, 738630) To keep a watch 1 over Narandas means that, when he seems to have taken an excessive burden upon himself you should caution him and also inform me.
('55', 390, 3, 14, 738778) I have discovered no ambiguity in any of my statements.
('55', 390, 3, 15, 738834) If they are ambiguous, they are so unintentionally and because of my imperfect command over language.
('55', 390, 3, 16, 738936) My statements are short, and hence they leave many things unsaid.
('55', 390, 3, 17, 739002) But in this respect they are like propositions in geometry.
('55', 390, 3, 18, 739062) Those girls who wish to learn English may certainly do so if they have paid attention to Hindi and Sanskrit and acquired a good command over Gujarati.
('55', 390, 3, 19, 739213) Of course, this is subject to facilities for teaching English being available.
('55', 390, 3, 20, 739292) We ought to have them, no doubt.
('55', 390, 3, 21, 739325) You do not seem to have understood my interpretation of passive exercises.
('55', 390, 3, 22, 739400) What a person does himself cannot be described as passive.
('55', 390, 3, 23, 739459) Passive exercises are for people who are ill.
('55', 390, 3, 24, 739505) If I am ill and wish to give exercise to my bowels, and if someone massages the abdomen or raises my legs several times to form a right angle with the rest of the body and lowers them again, and I am not required to raise or lower any limb, then that is passive exercise.
('55', 390, 3, 25, 739777) I dont think you have understood that this is what the phrase means.

('55', 391, 0, 1, 739889) 392 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 391, 1, 2, 739931) I had two aims in practising silent prayer.
('55', 391, 1, 3, 739975) One was, of course, to give rest to the mind.
('55', 391, 1, 4, 740021) But it was also difficult to turn the mind inward except through such prayer.
('55', 391, 1, 5, 740099) Whenever we lay aside one work and take up another, we should feel that we have ample time on hand.
('55', 391, 1, 6, 740199) We should not feel impatient or restless.
('55', 391, 1, 7, 740241) It is thus that we gradually learn detachment.
('55', 391, 1, 8, 740288) I think I do command concentration, but not well enough to satisfy me.
('55', 391, 1, 9, 740359) I try earnestly to cultivate such concentration, but I am not impatient.
('55', 391, 1, 10, 740432) If the children take no interest in any of the prayers, a special item can be included for them, as used to be done by Prabhudas.
('55', 391, 1, 11, 740562) I should be happy if they sit through the prayers with faith and in stillness.
('55', 391, 1, 12, 740641) I did not say it by way of praise that the same prayers have continued for sixteen years.
('55', 391, 1, 13, 740731) It was only a statement of fact.
('55', 391, 1, 14, 740764) I did not wish to suggest that all have been attending the prayers for so many years.
('55', 391, 1, 15, 740850) The Ashram has clung to these prayers in the face of all troubles and criticisms and quite a few people have derived peace of mind from them.
('55', 391, 1, 16, 740992) All that I intended to say was that these prayers ought not to be given up or altered without a strong reason.
('55', 391, 1, 17, 741103) Womens prayers will not seem proper in the evening.
('55', 391, 1, 18, 741155) Moreover, some people devote the evening to reading, etc.
('55', 391, 1, 19, 741213) What you write about yourself is correct.
('55', 391, 1, 20, 741255) You should follow your reason and your heart.
('55', 391, 1, 21, 741301) I am not impatient.
('55', 391, 1, 22, 741321) I may tell you what seems proper to me, but cannot force you to accept my suggestion against your reason.
('55', 391, 1, 23, 741427) All I can do is to act as a friend.
('55', 391, 1, 24, 741463) I can, at the most, claim my experiences over many years in my favour.
('55', 391, 1, 25, 741534) If, however, they find no echo in your heart, even thousands of them will have no value for you.
('55', 391, 1, 26, 741631) I make, of course, one claim for the Ashram.
('55', 391, 1, 27, 741676) It helps new comers to grow wings.
('55', 391, 1, 28, 741711) They may then fly where they will.
('55', 391, 1, 29, 741746) If they continue in the Ashram of their own free will, they are welcome to stay.
('55', 391, 1, 30, 741827) Even if they do not stay, the Ashram will have done its duty in one matter.
('55', 391, 1, 31, 741903) This can be proved to have happened to many persons, especially women.
('55', 391, 1, 32, 741974) At different times in the past, girls came and joined the Ashram, who had no spirit in them at all.
('55', 391, 1, 33, 742074) Today they believe themselves independent and are in fact so.
('55', 391, 1, 34, 742136) Such were Gulbadan, Umiya, Vidyavati, Rukhi, etc.
('55', 391, 1, 35, 742186) Love for individual persons is not wholly forbidden.
('55', 391, 1, 36, 742239) Only, such love should not be an obstacle to love for all beings and for God.
('55', 391, 1, 37, 742317) My love for Ba today flows from my

('55', 392, 1, 2, 742398) love for God.
('55', 392, 1, 3, 742412) When I was filled with lust, it was an obstacle to love of God and was, therefore, unworthy.
('55', 392, 1, 4, 742505) The loss in your weight need not worry you, if otherwise you are all right.

('55', 392, 6, 9, 742717) 2 should not be forced to forgo the two special facilities which she enjoys.
('55', 392, 6, 10, 742794) Till she herself feels a strong desire to forgo them, we cannot ask her to do so.
('55', 392, 6, 11, 742876) You are both right and not right in citing my example.
('55', 392, 6, 12, 742931) You are right because so long as I am doing active work people will point to my example and, in consequence, be misled.
('55', 392, 6, 13, 743051) For a variety of reasons, I cannot demonstrate in my own life standards of conduct which I expect others to follow.
('55', 392, 6, 14, 743167) I know that this is my deficiency as a leader.
('55', 392, 6, 15, 743214) At the same time, you are not right in citing my example because my condition is now different from that of my co workers.
('55', 392, 6, 16, 743337) One reason for this is my physical weakness, another is my Mahatmaship and the third is my uncommon mode of life.
('55', 392, 6, 17, 743451) Even if I were in C class, my food would be different from that of the other prisoners, either because of my weakness or my vows.
('55', 392, 6, 18, 743581) This would be so, more or less, in the case of any prisoner.
('55', 392, 6, 19, 743642) That other prisoners may not get special facilities of diet as quickly as I get them, is another question.
('55', 392, 6, 20, 743749) I see visitors once every week, instead of once every three months, and there is no restriction at all on the number of letters I can write.
('55', 392, 6, 21, 743890) In justification of this, I have told myself that I have no personal friends and that I do not see relations because they are relations, but my seeing them serves a moral aim.
('55', 392, 6, 22, 744066) I write letters with the same aim.
('55', 392, 6, 23, 744101) Whether there is an element of self indulgence lurking behind this, I do not know.

('55', 392, 7, 26, 744316) The addressee had questioned how Gandhiji could advise others to forgo privileges while he himself enjoyed them; why we are grieved to see an ailing or dying man; why we thank God if he survives; why Gandhiji had himself so thanked God when Manilal was saved; what the span of human life was, etc.

('55', 393, 1, 2, 744694) interviews and writing letters stopped, I would not be perturbed.
('55', 393, 1, 3, 744760) In the year 1930 I had stopped seeing visitorswhen a condition laid down by me was rejected.
('55', 393, 1, 4, 744853) 1 In 1922 I had similarly stopped writing letters.
('55', 393, 2, 5, 744904) Apart from these reasons, there is another reason too, namely, that I am kept apart from other prisoners.
('55', 393, 2, 6, 745010) For all these reasons, a comparison between other prisoners and me would not be right.
('55', 393, 2, 7, 745097) However, I dont think it proper on my part to try to convince anybody in this matter with arguments if the difference is not self evident to him.
('55', 393, 2, 8, 745243) There is certainly some difference between the case of a person for whom A class has been secured through outside influence and that of another who has got it in the normal course, but the difference is not worth stressing.
('55', 393, 2, 9, 745467) The ideal, of course, is that there should be no classes and, therefore, prisoners who have been put in the so called upper classes should give up their privileges.
('55', 393, 2, 10, 745632) Very few persons yet follow this ideal in practice, and so I do not feel inclined to put any burden on a young woman like .
('55', 393, 2, 11, 745756) She is a very thoughtful woman.
('55', 393, 2, 12, 745788) I am sure she exercises of her own accord whatever self control she is capable of.
('55', 393, 2, 13, 745871) My praying for Manilal was not a sign of my spirituality but was a sign of a fathers love for his son.
('55', 393, 2, 14, 745974) There can be only one right prayer, that God may do what He wills.
('55', 393, 2, 15, 746041) Of course the question can be asked what purpose such a prayer serves.
('55', 393, 2, 16, 746112) The reply to it is that the meaning of the prayer is not to be understood literally.
('55', 393, 2, 17, 746197) We are aware of the presence of God in our heart, but, for the moment we imagine him to be external to us and pray to Him in order that we may be delivered from ignorance.
('55', 393, 2, 18, 746369) In other words, we do not wish to follow wherever the mind drags us.
('55', 393, 2, 19, 746438) If, however, God is external to us, we wish to follow Him wherever He, our Master, leads us.
('55', 393, 2, 20, 746531) We do not know whether it is good for us that we should live or that we should die.
('55', 393, 2, 21, 746615) Hence we should not rejoice that we are alive or tremble at the thought of death.
('55', 393, 2, 22, 746697) We should look upon life and death as equal and be indifferent to them.
('55', 393, 2, 23, 746769) This is the ideal.
('55', 393, 2, 24, 746788) We should not give it up because we cannot reach it all at once or only rare persons can reach it.
('55', 393, 2, 25, 746887) On the contrary, the more we realize its difficulty the harder should be our effort to reach it.
('55', 393, 2, 26, 746984) The full span of a mans life can exceed even 100. But

('55', 394, 1, 2, 747211) however long a man may live, his life is not even one ten millionth of a moment in the infinite cycle of time.
('55', 394, 1, 3, 747322) Why, then, should we be eager to live a long life and try to determine its maximum span?
('55', 394, 1, 4, 747411) Any figure wedetermine will never be exact.
('55', 394, 1, 5, 747455) We can only guess what the maximum span of human life can be.
('55', 394, 1, 6, 747517) In actual life we even see a healthy child die suddenly.
('55', 394, 1, 7, 747574) Nor can we say that a sensual man will not enjoy a long life.At the most we can say that a person whose life has always been simple and pure will very probably enjoy a long life.
('55', 394, 1, 8, 747753) But those who acquire control over the senses in order that they may enjoy a long life only dig up a mountain in order to find a mouse.
('55', 394, 1, 9, 747889) We should acquire control over the senses in order that we may know the self.
('55', 394, 1, 10, 747967) We should not care if, as a result of such control, our life becomes shorter instead of longer.
('55', 394, 1, 11, 748063) A healthy and long life is the least important benefit of freedom from the cravings of the senses.

('55', 394, 5, 17, 748326) Your health must return to normal.

('55', 394, 5, 23, 748680) I will not get your spinning wheel here as my stay here is uncertain and also I have no time.
('55', 394, 5, 24, 748774) There is no time today for writing anything more.
('55', 394, 5, 25, 748824) What kind of life is this that even here I do not get time.
('55', 394, 5, 26, 748884) But then, you know my programme.

('55', 395, 3, 4, 749223) BABALBHAI, We should do a thing to please elders if it is not immoral.
('55', 395, 3, 5, 749294) It cannot be a matter of dharma to sing group prayers aloud.
('55', 395, 3, 6, 749355) Hence you cannot offer satyagraha to get freedom to do so.
('55', 395, 3, 7, 749414) There is no loss of self respect at all in giving finger prints in a jail.
('55', 395, 3, 8, 749489) The practice of obtaining prisoners finger prints has no bearing on the fear of their running away.

('55', 395, 7, 11, 749690) May 20, 1932
('55', 395, 8, 12, 749703) You should not be in the least disappointed at seeing no immediate result whatever of your work.
('55', 395, 8, 13, 749800) We should stick to the work undertaken, in single minded devotion to it, with the faith that service done with pure motives, selflessly and as sacrifice to the Lord never fails to bear fruit.
('55', 395, 8, 14, 749992) We even know that often in the past men gave their whole lives to some good cause and the fruits were enjoyed only by those who came after them.
('55', 395, 8, 15, 750137) It should not be a matter of any wonder if four or five years of work by men like us yield no results in a poor, despairing region like Orissa, where several people may have gone under the pretext of public service and robbed the people.
('55', 395, 8, 16, 750375) On the contrary, it would be a matter for wonder if such a brief period yielded any results.
('55', 395, 8, 17, 750468) Besides, you actually see the beginning of someresults.
('55', 395, 8, 18, 750524) Your field of work lies there, and you and your co workers should stick to it with the conviction that it is also the place where you can attain self realization.
('55', 395, 8, 19, 750687) I was glad to learn this time that all of you are in good health.
('55', 395, 8, 20, 750753) As you get more and more accustomed to the climate there and the mind remains cheerful, that will have its good effect on your health too.

('55', 396, 13, 20, 751821) PRABHUDAS, I was keenly waiting for your letter.
('55', 396, 13, 21, 751870) Ultimately it arrived.
('55', 396, 14, 22, 751893) Dhiru had come to see me and left behind the Magan spinning wheel.
('55', 396, 15, 23, 751960) 1 A few lines after this have been crossed out in the source.
('55', 396, 15, 24, 752022) They may have been censored by the jail authorities or cancelled by Gandhiji himself, who had dictated this letter, having written only the last few lines himself.
('55', 397, 0, 1, 752186) 398 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 397, 1, 2, 752228) I observed him drawing yarn on it for a minute.
('55', 397, 1, 3, 752276) From the very next day, I started spinning on it.
('55', 397, 1, 4, 752326) I had to face a lot of difficulties but I cannot say that the written suggestions sent to me by Padma were of any help.
('55', 397, 1, 5, 752446) You had assessed the qualities of a learner and a stupid learner, and according to that estimate, I stand nowhere even near the stupid learner.
('55', 397, 1, 6, 752590) I wasted quite a large number of slivers while plying it, sometimes for four hours, sometimes for five hours and sometimes for three hours.
('55', 397, 1, 7, 752730) Now I can say that I have acquired sufficient mastery over it.
('55', 397, 1, 8, 752793) Today, I spun 183 rounds of yarn in about one and a half hours.
('55', 397, 1, 9, 752857) When the switch which gives direction to the wheel does not arrive and stop at the right place, the wheel requires pushing by hand.
('55', 397, 1, 10, 752989) The directions for the difficulties I encountered are not mentioned in your list of suggestions.
('55', 397, 1, 11, 753086) From that, I have come to the conclusion that my difficulties are unusual.
('55', 397, 1, 12, 753161) If that is a fact, it is not surprising.
('55', 397, 1, 13, 753202) An old mans organs do not co operate with each other promptly.
('55', 397, 1, 14, 753265) So I took time in bringing about co ordination between my hand and fingers.
('55', 397, 1, 15, 753341) I could not work on two spindles because of pain in my left wrist.
('55', 397, 1, 16, 753408) The doctors believe that the pain will not go unless I give my left wrist complete rest.
('55', 397, 1, 17, 753497) So the biggest utility of the Magan spinning wheel for me is that because of it I am able to continue spinning.
('55', 397, 1, 18, 753609) I have started hoping that gradually I will be able to achieve my normal speed on the Magan spining wheel.
('55', 397, 1, 19, 753716) Al one time I feared that I would not be able to spin on it at all.
('55', 397, 1, 20, 753784) But I did not want to accept defeat and therefore worked hard on it.
('55', 397, 1, 21, 753853) I do not find spinning on it at all difficult.
('55', 397, 1, 22, 753900) Initially I used to get tired but now I do not.
('55', 397, 1, 23, 753948) 1 Today is the fourteenth day of my spinning.
('55', 397, 1, 24, 753994) I like mydevices.
('55', 397, 1, 25, 754012) It is good.
('55', 397, 1, 26, 754024) The spinning wheel is cheap and there is scope for making it still cheaper.
('55', 397, 1, 27, 754100) Some modifications occur to me but I will take sometime to carry those out.
('55', 397, 1, 28, 754176) I cannot say just now that I have so much mastery over the spinning wheel as to makemodifications in it.
('55', 397, 1, 29, 754281) It is plied with both hands that is no doubt a clear advantage.
('55', 397, 1, 30, 754345) An efficient spinner would spin either twice or one and a half times or one and two third times more with two hands than he would with one hand.
('55', 397, 1, 31, 754490) I can think of other reasons too, for producing more yarn on it.
('55', 397, 1, 32, 754555) I may be wrong.

('55', 398, 1, 2, 754835) interest I am taking in your spinning wheel.
('55', 398, 1, 3, 754880) You will be very happy.
('55', 398, 1, 4, 754904) I had decided to experiment with your spinning wheel at a time when I had no problem with my wrist.
('55', 398, 1, 5, 755004) Now I have to do that under compulsion.
('55', 398, 1, 6, 755044) Either I give up spinning or spin on the same spinning wheel.
('55', 398, 1, 7, 755106) Just as a person who is in difficulty thinks of new tricks to save himself, I will keep on thinking about new techniques of improving my speed on the Magan spinning wheel.
('55', 398, 1, 8, 755278) And if you are released, and I am allowed visitors at the time, come and see me and teach me some new tricks.
('55', 398, 2, 9, 755388) And when you say that you would not allow anyone to depend on you, then on whose strength are you going to buy the land?
('55', 398, 2, 10, 755509) How then can you insist on buying the land?
('55', 398, 2, 11, 755553) One of the conditions of buying the land was that you would stay on it as a guard.
('55', 398, 2, 12, 755636) You violate that condition and suggest buying the landhow are both things possible.
('55', 398, 2, 13, 755720) It does not matter if you violate the conditions because as long as the land is not bought, you have to some extent a right to change your opinion.
('55', 398, 2, 14, 755868) But the moment you absolve yourself from that condition, you lose the right to suggest buying of land.
('55', 398, 2, 15, 755971) Not only that.
('55', 398, 2, 16, 755986) The land will be bought under new conditions in case it is bought.
('55', 398, 2, 17, 756053) And as you say, the talk you had with the seller was final.
('55', 398, 2, 18, 756113) Then you cannot absolve yourself from the commitment.
('55', 398, 2, 19, 756167) I do not analyse all these to bind you but to show you what difficult predicament you are in.
('55', 398, 2, 20, 756261) I understand you.
('55', 398, 2, 21, 756279) I do not want to criticise you in any way.
('55', 398, 2, 22, 756322) One need not bind a devoted worker like you.
('55', 398, 2, 23, 756367) No person, however respected he is, can absolve others from their moral obligations.
('55', 398, 2, 24, 756452) Everyone has to define his or her own moralobligations himself.
('55', 398, 2, 25, 756516) As long as you do not have trust in yourself, you should not even accept for yourself any moral obligation.
('55', 398, 2, 26, 756624) If you compel yourself, you will possibly impede your progress.
('55', 398, 2, 27, 756688) It is all right if you rise gradually.
('55', 398, 2, 28, 756727) No doubt you are going to rise because your intentions are pure, you are hardworking, you want to help others to the best of your ability and you do not want to deceive yourself.
('55', 398, 2, 29, 756906) However, you will come across many moral dilemmas.
('55', 398, 2, 30, 756957) Do not worry about them.
('55', 398, 2, 31, 756982) They will help you to become a matured person.
('55', 398, 3, 32, 757029) Matparah means devotion to truth.
('55', 398, 3, 33, 757063) Charan Padma means lotus feet of Satyanarayan.

('55', 399, 1, 2, 757360) devotee has personified truth.
('55', 399, 1, 3, 757391) Truth is formless and so people imagine it in the form they like.
('55', 399, 1, 4, 757457) In spite of knowing that it is imagination, different persons conceive different images.
('55', 399, 1, 5, 757546) As long as the imagination lasts, theimages are true; the devotees ascribe whatever they want, to those images.
('55', 399, 1, 6, 757658) In fact, Vishnu, Maheshwar, Brahma, Bhagwan, Ishwar, etc.
('55', 399, 1, 7, 757716) are all meaningless names or are wanting in meaning.
('55', 399, 1, 8, 757769) But truth conveys full meaning.
('55', 399, 1, 9, 757801) A person who says that he will die for God would not be able to explain what he meant by that and the listener, too, would hardly grasp the meaning of what is told to him.
('55', 399, 1, 10, 757973) But a person who says that he would die for truth, knows what he had said and the listener would also most probably grasp the meaning of it.
('55', 399, 1, 11, 758114) You ask me, what does Rama mean? It is almost meaningless to worship Him after I explain to you the meaning.
('55', 399, 1, 12, 758223) But if you worship Rama with the realization that one whom you wanted to worship was Him, only then will he be a Kamadhenu 1 to you.
('55', 399, 1, 13, 758356) If you recite the name of Rama with that faith, be it a parrot like recitation, you will transcend the material world.
('55', 399, 1, 14, 758475) The difference is that you recite the name of Rama with faith in Him which a parrot certainly does not have.
('55', 399, 1, 15, 758584) A parrot is devoid of faith and will therefore feel tired and give up, or, if he worshipped God in pursuit of self interest.
('55', 399, 1, 16, 758709) he will keep quiet after collecting enough grains for himself.
('55', 399, 1, 17, 758772) From this point of view, you do not need a symbol.
('55', 399, 1, 18, 758823) Tulsidas has given more importance to the name of Rama than to Rama, the man.
('55', 399, 1, 19, 758901) That is to say, he has suggested that the name need not have any meaning.
('55', 399, 1, 20, 758975) A devotee will create the necessary meaning later on according to the nature and quality of his faith in Him.
('55', 399, 1, 21, 759085) That is the beauty of the practice of such worship, otherwise it cannot be proved how even the dullest of men can enjoy spiritual awakening.
('55', 399, 1, 22, 759226) The only condition is that the name of God should not be taken to impress others or to deceive others.
('55', 399, 1, 23, 759329) As I have suggested, if a man worships God with faith in Him and never tires of doing so, for him He becomes a Kalpataru.
('55', 399, 1, 24, 759451) I have no doubt about it.
('55', 399, 1, 25, 759477) Men so inclined can prove this for themselves.
('55', 399, 1, 26, 759524) Initially, their mind, while worshiping God, will wander for days together, in some cases for years; they will become restless, feel sleepy, even more than that, they might have some tragic experience, but even then if they keep on worshipping God, their devotion will pay.
('55', 399, 1, 27, 759798) I have no doubt about it.
('55', 399, 1, 28, 759824) An inanimate thing like a spinning wheel comes under control only after giving us a lot of trouble.
('55', 399, 1, 29, 759924) Other things which are

('55', 400, 1, 2, 760065) more difficult give us more trouble before we achieve them.
('55', 400, 1, 3, 760125) What can we do for a person who wants to achieve the best but does not take the medicines prescribed for it patiently for a long time and gets disappointed.
('55', 400, 1, 4, 760282) I feel that the above covers answers to all your questions; after these there remains nothing for you to ask.
('55', 400, 1, 5, 760392) If you can develop faith, go on repeating His name while doing your workeating, drinking, sitting or sleeping.
('55', 400, 1, 6, 760503) Even if you have to devote your whole life, you are not going to accept defeat.
('55', 400, 1, 7, 760583) If you do this, no doubt, you will be more and more at peace with yourself with each passing day.
('55', 400, 1, 8, 760681) Do only as much writing and reading as you can without straining yourself.
('55', 400, 1, 9, 760756) There is no need to tire out yourself by drawing up a big programme of writing and reading or getting disappointed if you are not able to keep it up.
('55', 400, 1, 10, 760906) I will see what I can do for Devidutt and Chandradutts sister Lakshmi.
('55', 400, 1, 11, 760977) 1 I believe Chhaganlal will take care of inspection and checking of trivial things about which you have written.
('55', 400, 1, 12, 761090) Dhiru has lost a lot of weight and so he has gone to Ranavav.
('55', 400, 1, 13, 761152) Kusum has also gone as she too keeps indifferent health.
('55', 400, 1, 14, 761209) Padma has not recovered from her illness, so I need not expect much from her.
('55', 400, 1, 15, 761287) The three of us are still together and are keeping good health.
('55', 400, 1, 16, 761351) I am writing on aparigraha for the Ashram somewhat on the lines you wanted me to write.
('55', 400, 1, 17, 761439) I do not get much time as I am occupied these days with Magan spinning wheel and the increased correspondence.
('55', 400, 1, 18, 761550) And for that reason .
('55', 400, 1, 19, 761572) 2 is lying unfinished.
('55', 400, 1, 20, 761595) I will certainly not draft trivial rules.
('55', 400, 1, 21, 761637) I neither have the inclination nor it is good to draft such trivial rules.
('55', 400, 1, 22, 761712) With the change of place and time, new sub rules will emerge from great principles.
('55', 400, 1, 23, 761796) At the same time, some rules will become obsolete while new ones will come in force.
('55', 400, 1, 24, 761881) If you have a thorough understanding of the basic principles, then you would know the source of the sub principles and be able to draft the rules easily.
('55', 400, 1, 25, 762035) Just as a person who knows the derivation of the principles of geometry is able to find the correct time.
('55', 400, 1, 26, 762141) Totaramjis wife, Gangadevi was conscious till the last moment.

('55', 401, 5, 13, 762946) CHHAGANLAL, I am enclosing a letter from Prabhudas.
('55', 401, 5, 14, 762998) I have given an answer 2 to his spiritual problems.
('55', 401, 5, 15, 763050) As for the Almora Iand, I have said that the idea of buying the land has been given up as no responsible person is at present in a position to stay there and Pantji 3 is also away.
('55', 401, 5, 16, 763231) I have also written to him at length about the Magan spinning wheel on which I have been spinning and over which I have acquired some control for the last four days or so.
('55', 401, 5, 17, 763403) I think he will be happy to read that I have also added that he might come and see me when he is released, if I see visitors then.
('55', 401, 5, 18, 763534) As for Lakshmi, Devidattas sister, I have said that I will do the needful.
('55', 401, 5, 19, 763609) You have to reply to all the remaining points.
('55', 401, 5, 20, 763656) He is in excellent health and does not seem to have any trouble now.
('55', 401, 5, 21, 763725) It seems he would desire a change of place when the monsoon sets in and it rains heavily.
('55', 401, 5, 22, 763815) The letter has been censored at several places and this is my guess from the portions not struck off by the officials.
('55', 401, 5, 23, 763934) However that may be, a request for a transfer should not be made and certainly cannot be made from here.
('55', 401, 5, 24, 764039) Dr. Talwalkar may make the suggestion if he thinks it fit and wishes to do so.
('55', 401, 5, 25, 764118) I do not have the fear which Prabhudas has.
('55', 401, 5, 26, 764162) But no one can tell, and when the patient himself is afraid, his fear itself brings about what he fears.
('55', 401, 5, 27, 764267) As for Khushalbhai, I guess from the letter which I have received that he has got a new lease of life for a time.
('55', 401, 5, 28, 764381) All three of us are well.

('55', 402, 8, 16, 765208) Convey the sympathies of us all to Tehminabehn 3. God has ordained death as well as birth.
('55', 402, 8, 17, 765299) We, therefore, should not rejoice at the one and grieve over the other.
('55', 402, 8, 18, 765371) Everything has two sides, or rather, the two are one and the same thing.
('55', 402, 8, 19, 765444) In our eagerness to live, we believe death to be different from life and something bad.
('55', 402, 8, 20, 765532) I have read Hazrats ghazal twice already.
('55', 402, 8, 21, 765574) I shall read it again to understand it thoroughly.
('55', 402, 9, 22, 765625) Please be satisfied with this much exercise for today, I take some time to write so much, as I write with the reed pen and take great care to see that the handwriting is good.
('55', 402, 9, 23, 765801) Please forgive me for forgetting to reply to your question.
('55', 402, 9, 24, 765861) I thought I had replied to it.
('55', 402, 9, 25, 765892) There is no doubt at all that your duty is to stay with Mother.
('55', 402, 9, 26, 765956) That is to be the form of your sadhana 5 and also your service.
('55', 402, 9, 27, 766020) I am, therefore, glad that you have made this choice.
('55', 402, 9, 28, 766074) Always remain satisfied with it.

('55', 403, 7, 21, 767227) Their mother teaches them.

('55', 404, 2, 3, 767643) May 22, 1932
('55', 404, 3, 4, 767656) I have already written about our cats love of cleanliness.
('55', 404, 4, 5, 767715) Observing her and her kittens ways, I feel that she is an ideal teacher.
('55', 404, 4, 6, 767788) Whatever they have to be taught, she teaches quietly and without any fuss.
('55', 404, 4, 7, 767863) The method is quite easy.
('55', 404, 4, 8, 767889) She demonstrates to them by her own example what she wishes to teach, and the kittens learn the thing very quickly.
('55', 404, 4, 9, 768005) In this manner they learnt to run, climb trees and come down again carefully to eat, to kill a prey and to lick their bodies and clean them.
('55', 404, 4, 10, 768146) In a very short time they have learnt to do all that their mother can do.
('55', 404, 4, 11, 768220) The cat does not leave the kittens alone for long.
('55', 404, 4, 12, 768271) Her love for them is just like that of a womans for her children.
('55', 404, 4, 13, 768337) She sleeps with the kittens clinging to her.
('55', 404, 4, 14, 768382) When they indicate a desire to suck, she lies down and lets them do it.
('55', 404, 4, 15, 768454) If she has killed a prey, she brings it to them.
('55', 404, 4, 16, 768503) Vallabhbhai gives them some milk every day.
('55', 404, 4, 17, 768547) All three of them lick it from a saucer.
('55', 404, 4, 18, 768588) Sometimes the mother only looks on without sharing the milk.
('55', 404, 4, 19, 768649) She plays with them as if she were their own age, and even engages in a sort of wrestling with them.
('55', 404, 4, 20, 768750) I have drawn a lesson from all this, namely, that if we wish to educate children properly we should ourselves do what we want to teach them to do.
('55', 404, 4, 21, 768897) Children have great capacity for imitating others.
('55', 404, 4, 22, 768948) They do not easily understand what is explained to them orally.
('55', 404, 4, 23, 769012) If we wish to teach them truthfulness, we ourselves should be scrupulously truthful.
('55', 404, 4, 24, 769097) If we wish to teach them not to keep with them more things than they need, we, too, should not do that.
('55', 404, 4, 25, 769201) And what is true about moral rules is true about bodily labour.
('55', 404, 4, 26, 769265) Looking at the matter in this light, we immediately see that the present day education produces very little result, considering the expenditure of money and time which it involves.
('55', 404, 4, 27, 769446) We also realize that all grown ups are teachers so far as children are concerned.
('55', 404, 4, 28, 769528) It is because people do not pay proper attention to their duty as teachers that education has degenerated.

('55', 405, 1, 3, 769929) We, therefore, should do much more than what they do.
('55', 405, 1, 4, 769983) But before we can do so, as guardians of the moral character of the next generation we should observe moral principles in our own lives.
('55', 405, 1, 5, 770120) We should learn, to the best of our ability, to live as we wish the next generation to live.
('55', 405, 1, 6, 770213) I have written all this with the hope that all men and women inmates of the Ashram who give their services as teachers, and others too, may think along these lines and, wherever necessary, act accordingly.

('55', 405, 5, 10, 770504) MY DEAR CHILD, I understand all you are doing.
('55', 405, 5, 11, 770551) Only you must not work yourself into anxiety.
('55', 405, 5, 12, 770597) If we simply make ourselves instruments of His will, we should never have [an] anxious moment.
('55', 405, 5, 13, 770692) Yes, there is no calm without a storm, there is no peace without strife.
('55', 405, 5, 14, 770765) Strife is inherent in peace.
('55', 405, 5, 15, 770794) We should not know it without [strife].
('55', 405, 5, 16, 770834) Life is a perpetual struggle against strife whether within or without.
('55', 405, 5, 17, 770905) Hence the necessity of realizing peace in the midst of strife.
('55', 405, 5, 18, 770968) It has been hot in Poona this time.
('55', 405, 5, 19, 771004) As a rule it is never so hot in Poona.
('55', 405, 5, 20, 771043) But the rains are now coming in and we are having beautiful sunsets and sweet songs of the birds.
('55', 405, 5, 21, 771141) Have you been to that patient 1 again?
('55', 405, 5, 22, 771180) I told you Mahadev was with me.

('55', 405, 5, 24, 771255) He is now spinning very fine counts.
('55', 405, 5, 25, 771292) Owing to weakness of my hands I cannot do much.

('55', 406, 1, 4, 771752) We have made friends with a cat and her kittens.
('55', 406, 1, 5, 771801) I call her sister.
('55', 406, 1, 6, 771820) It is delightful to watch her love for her young ones.
('55', 406, 1, 7, 771875) She teaches them all sorts of things by simply doing them.
('55', 406, 1, 8, 771934) God bless you.

('55', 406, 3, 12, 772105) There is no substitute for charkha for universal relief.
('55', 406, 3, 13, 772162) It is nonsense for you to talk of old age so long as you outrun young men in the race for service and in the midst of anxious times fill rooms with your laughter and inspire youth with hope when they are on the brink of despair.

('55', 406, 6, 17, 772546) Will you not give yourself rest and the body a chance of recovery?
('55', 406, 6, 18, 772613) Though death and life are the faces of the same coin and though we should die as cheerfully as we live, it is necessary until lifeis there to give the body its due.
('55', 406, 6, 19, 772778) It is a charge given to us by God.

('55', 407, 1, 4, 773248) Did you convey it to him?

('55', 407, 2, 8, 773419) 490. A LETTER May 22, 1932 CHI., We ourselves are the source of moha 2. There are two powers dwelling within us: the divine and the demoniac, the Pandavas and the Kauravas.
('55', 407, 2, 9, 773592) The demoniac is the source of moha.
('55', 407, 2, 10, 773628) Why should we not fix our minds on the true Mahadeva instead of on His image made of earth?
('55', 407, 2, 11, 773720) Or rise from the inert matter to spirit?
('55', 407, 2, 12, 773761) If we cling to the trunk,we automatically get hold of the branch.
('55', 407, 2, 13, 773827) If, on the contrary, we cling to the branch, the branch will break and we shall fall with it.
('55', 407, 2, 14, 773921) It is no sin to think about people with whom we are related by blood.
('55', 407, 2, 15, 773991) However, we wish to enlarge our definition of blood relations so as to include in it all people.
('55', 407, 2, 16, 774088) If we make a distinction between ours and the others, we suffer in innumerable ways.
('55', 407, 2, 17, 774173) If we imbibe the truth that the two are the same, there will remain the pain of neither separation nor death.
('55', 407, 2, 18, 774283) Do not look upon this as philosophical or difficult knowledge and be scared by it.
('55', 407, 2, 19, 774366) It deserves to be digested.
('55', 407, 2, 20, 774394) Such an attitude of mind means not diminishing of love but its enlargement.
('55', 407, 2, 21, 774470) In truth, we always go on, knowingly or unknowingly, enlarging our idea of ours.
('55', 407, 2, 22, 774551) If we carefully grasp this supremelyvaluable law, it leads to very important results.
('55', 407, 2, 23, 774637) From all I have written, accept only as much as you can digest and leave the rest.
('55', 407, 2, 24, 774720) The rule that applies to food applies here also I hope that the change of climate will do you good.

('55', 408, 8, 12, 775448) You do not have to seek permission from here to visit me.
('55', 408, 8, 13, 775506) You must write to Narandas, so that you can be allotted your day when someone is coming from the Ashram.
('55', 408, 8, 14, 775611) Only one interview is allowed in a week.
('55', 408, 8, 15, 775652) Even this is likely to be stopped.
('55', 408, 8, 16, 775687) Interviews have been stopped in the case of Mirabehn.
('55', 408, 8, 17, 775741) If that restriction is continued, I may have to stop interviews.
('55', 408, 8, 18, 775806) You will be informed if that happens.

('55', 409, 11, 17, 776797) I have had two letters from Anand.

('55', 410, 3, 4, 777283) NARANDAS, I got your letter on Wednesday morning.
('55', 410, 3, 5, 777333) If you think that I am doing any injustice to Harilal, please tell me.
('55', 410, 3, 6, 777404) I say this because you have not said in your letter what you decided after reading my letter 1
('55', 410, 4, 7, 777499) to Harilal.
('55', 410, 4, 8, 777511) Provided you observe the three conditions I have mentioned, you may do all you can.
('55', 410, 4, 9, 777595) I can have no objection then.
('55', 410, 4, 10, 777625) If you have found any improvement as a result of the period of silence having been increased to five minutes, please let me know.
('55', 410, 4, 11, 777755) Lady Vithaldas, Mathew and Manibehn came and saw me.
('55', 410, 4, 12, 777808) Mirabehn will not be permitted.
('55', 410, 4, 13, 777840) The decision has been a great blow to her.
('55', 410, 4, 14, 777883) I feel that if the gates are not opened to her, I should stop seeing any visitors.
('55', 410, 4, 15, 777966) I have even written a letter 2 to the Government (very nearly) to this effect.
('55', 410, 4, 16, 778045) It is probable, therefore, that the next week will be the last during which I shall be seeing visitors.
('55', 410, 4, 17, 778149) And even of that I am not certain, for, if I get a negative reply before that, I will stop seeing visitors immediately.
('55', 410, 4, 18, 778269) I, therefore, also intend to drop a postcard to you today.
('55', 410, 4, 19, 778328) If you get it in time, it should be in your hands on Sunday.
('55', 410, 4, 20, 778389) If you do get it and if you do not receive a wire from me not to come, it might be advisable for you to start soon.
('55', 410, 4, 21, 778505) Provided, that is, you think it necessary to come and see me.
('55', 410, 4, 22, 778567) This applies to Premabehn and Sushila too.
('55', 410, 4, 23, 778610) I think it will be difficult to make the labourers give up smoking.
('55', 410, 4, 24, 778678) It would of course be good if you succeed.
('55', 410, 4, 25, 778721) But it would be most undesirable if they agree to give it up for fear of losing their jobs or any other similar reason and then continue to smoke on the sly.
('55', 410, 4, 26, 778879) One labourer may be a smoker and still be good in other ways, while another who does not smoke may be a very bad man.
('55', 410, 4, 27, 778997) Of the two, the one who smokes is a far better person.
('55', 410, 4, 28, 779052) Hence, while paying attention to the habits of those whom you engage as labourers, pay as much attention as you can to their inner character as well.
('55', 410, 4, 29, 779202) I was glad to learn that Dhiru and Kusum have gone to Ranavav.

('55', 411, 1, 2, 779432) Dont let them return to the Ashram all too soon.
('55', 411, 1, 3, 779481) We may be sure that those who have understood the meaning of the Ashram rules of life and have fallen in love with that life will carry the Ashram wherever they go.
('55', 411, 1, 4, 779646) Moreover, if Dhiru and Kusum, who have spent many years in the Ashram, cannot observe the Ashram rules even while living away from it, it will only show that they have Iearnt nothing from their stay in the Ashram.
('55', 411, 1, 5, 779860) Anybody who has understood the meaning of the Ashram life can serve wherever he lives.
('55', 411, 1, 6, 779947) The field of service is as wide as the world, and opportunities for it exist everywhere.
('55', 411, 1, 7, 780036) Dhiru and Kusum, therefore, ought not to get impatient.
('55', 411, 1, 8, 780092) If the water of Ranavav agrees with them and their health improves, let them stay there till they get completely all right.
('55', 411, 1, 9, 780216) Pyare Ali, Noorbanu and Tilakam have not come [to see me till now].
('55', 411, 1, 10, 780284) If you sent any messages with Mathew, they remained with him, for he could not speak much.
('55', 411, 1, 11, 780375) I have received no letter from Ba so far.
('55', 411, 1, 12, 780417) Maybe her letters have not been dispatched from there.
('55', 411, 1, 13, 780472) They dont seem to keep back any letter here.
('55', 411, 1, 14, 780517) If any of you can, please inquire from theSuperintendent whether they have been dispatched.
('55', 411, 1, 15, 780609) In any case Ba can certainly inquire.
('55', 411, 2, 16, 780647) May 20, 1932
('55', 411, 3, 17, 780660) Are there any Chharas still staying near the Ashram?
('55', 411, 3, 18, 780713) If there are, have you cultivated contacts with them?
('55', 411, 3, 19, 780767) Do they harass you in any way?
('55', 411, 3, 20, 780798) Why do the Ashram inmates keep a watch [at night]?
('55', 411, 3, 21, 780849) For how many hours is the watch kept?
('55', 411, 3, 22, 780887) Who are the persons taking turns?
('55', 411, 3, 23, 780921) Who stays in Doctors bungalow?
('55', 411, 3, 24, 780952) Who stays in Jyotirbhavan?
('55', 411, 3, 25, 780979) I send with this a letter from Chhaganlal, along with one from Prabhudas to me.
('55', 411, 3, 26, 781059) Read both of them.
('55', 411, 3, 27, 781078) There is a reference to Lakshmi in them.
('55', 411, 3, 28, 781119) If Balkrishna agrees to accommodate her in Wardha, let her go and stay there.
('55', 411, 3, 29, 781197) If Balkrishna does not agree or if the girl wants to stay in Sabarmati and if you see no difficulty in that, accommodate her there.
('55', 411, 3, 30, 781329) 1 If you cannot do so and if Balkrishna is not prepared to accept the responsibility, write to Devidatta and inform him accordingly.
('55', 411, 3, 31, 781462) And also to Prabhudas.
('55', 411, 3, 32, 781485) I can now say that I have acquired control over the Magan spinning wheel.
('55', 411, 3, 33, 781559) Today I spun 183 rounds in about 2 1/2 hours.
('55', 411, 3, 34, 781605) The yarn must be of about 16 counts.

('55', 412, 1, 3, 781855) The wheel still offers difficulties.
('55', 412, 1, 4, 781892) I have often to use my hand and put the wheel in the right position.
('55', 412, 1, 5, 781961) I believe this must be a defect.
('55', 412, 1, 6, 781994) The pedal produces a low grating sound.
('55', 412, 1, 7, 782034) Show this to Keshu.
('55', 412, 1, 8, 782054) Ask him if he has any suggestion to make.

('55', 412, 2, 12, 782291) May 23, 1932

('55', 412, 5, 17, 782526) I have a most vivid recollection of the very pleasant and peaceful time we had at your place.
('55', 412, 5, 18, 782620) 2 From what I saw during those brief hours and in autumn I can easily picture all you say of Epping Forest in spring time.
('55', 412, 5, 19, 782743) It was a matter of sorrow to me that I could not see the friends who visited India recently to study the situation.
('55', 412, 5, 20, 782859) Please give my regards to Mr. Bartlett and tell him that as soon as I received his letter enclosing the Poets appeal I sent him my reply 3 which had naturally to pass through the Central Government.

('55', 413, 3, 4, 783693) MANUDI, I have your letter now, but I have been regularly getting news about you from others.
('55', 413, 3, 5, 783787) I have collected a good many pictures for you.
('55', 413, 3, 6, 783834) I had collected them during my last imprisonment but I could not meet you at all and give them to you.
('55', 413, 3, 7, 783937) Some of those are still left, to which I go on adding more.
('55', 413, 3, 8, 783997) You will get them sooner or later.
('55', 413, 3, 9, 784032) The later you getthem, the more precious they will be, wont they?
('55', 413, 3, 10, 784098) I am glad that you do not wear ornaments.
('55', 413, 3, 11, 784140) Never mind losing your hair.
('55', 413, 3, 12, 784169) It will grow again.
('55', 413, 3, 13, 784189) There is no beauty in wearing long hair.
('55', 413, 3, 14, 784230) If there were any, one would look beautiful even with hair stuck on the head.
('55', 413, 3, 15, 784308) Beauty lies in goodness of heart.
('55', 413, 3, 16, 784342) If it was not so, the sight of glass or wax dolls would be enough to give us pleasure, and we would preserve the soulless body in a frame.
('55', 413, 3, 17, 784481) The fact that we do not do so means that whatever beauty there is in the soul.
('55', 413, 3, 18, 784560) Can this be in anything except its qualities?
('55', 413, 3, 19, 784606) One who realizes this will look upon the body as only a means for the progress of the soul.

('55', 414, 7, 17, 785962) For some time I had no faith, but it began to grow when I started thinking and reflecting about religion, and it has gone on increasing ever since as I have come to feel more and more distinctly the presence of God in my heart.
('55', 414, 7, 18, 786190) But why do you ask me this question?
('55', 414, 7, 19, 786227) Is it with the intention of publishing my answer in a future issue of Kalyan?

('55', 415, 9, 18, 787625) Acharya Ray I had the privilege of knowing for the first time when Gokhale was his next door neighbour in 1901 and I was undergoing tutelage under the latter.
('55', 415, 9, 19, 787784) It was difficult to believe that the man in simple Indian dress and wearing simpler manners could possibly be the great scientist and professor he even then was.
('55', 415, 9, 20, 787946) And it took my breath away when I heard that out of his princely salary he kept only a few rupees for himself and the rest he devoted to public uses and particularly for helping poor students.
('55', 415, 9, 21, 788139) Thirty years have made no difference to the great and good servant of India.

('55', 416, 7, 16, 789233) How can a single school for Harijan children be closed while the members of the Samiti are alive?
('55', 416, 7, 17, 789331) If they are sincere, they would sell themselves into slavery, would sell their property but continue to run every school.
('55', 416, 7, 18, 789453) Instead of accepting defeat, therefore, you should have hope that when you come forward to sell yourselves, the people will buy you and pay the Samiti all the money it needs.

('55', 417, 2, 3, 789928) May 24, 1932 Boys and girls should be married only after they have grown up.
('55', 417, 2, 4, 790005) The partners should choose each other with the consent of their parents.
('55', 417, 2, 5, 790078) Hence there is no unnatural restriction in such a method.
('55', 417, 2, 6, 790136) If anybody asks my opinion, I would say that marriage between persons following different faiths was a risky experiment.
('55', 417, 2, 7, 790257) If both husband and wife believe in their respective religions and actively follow them in their lives, difficulties are likely to arise between them.
('55', 417, 2, 8, 790408) Thus I think that the Bhatia girls marriage is a risky step, but I do not regard it as irreligious.
('55', 417, 2, 9, 790508) I would not oppose it if their love is pure, if the Bhatia girl can follow her religion and the Muslim youth his and if their ideas about food are the same.
('55', 417, 2, 10, 790665) But I do not advocate marriages between persons of different faiths as I advocate inter caste marriages because I desire the disappearance of sub castes.
('55', 417, 2, 11, 790819) I would not agitate against such marriages either.
('55', 417, 2, 12, 790870) This is an issue on which every man and woman should think and decide for himself or herself.

('55', 417, 5, 17, 791079) May 25, 1932 When I said that writing about the abuse of occult powers you might have been stronger, 1 I used the adjective precisely in the same sense in which I use it regarding admitted evils.
('55', 417, 5, 18, 791275) I feel that whilst we should spare evil doers, we dare not be sparing in our condemnation of evil.
('55', 417, 5, 19, 791374) Perfect gentleness is not inconsistent with clearest possible denunciation of what one knows to be evil, so long as that knowledge persists; and there would need to be no cause for regret later if our knowledge of the past was found to be a great error of judgment.
('55', 417, 5, 20, 791640) In our endeavour to approach absolute truth we shall always have to be content with relative truth from time to time, the relative at each stage being for us as good as the absolute.
('55', 417, 5, 21, 791823) It can be easily demonstrated

('55', 418, 1, 2, 792009) that there would be no progress if there was no such confidence in oneself.
('55', 418, 1, 3, 792085) Of course our language would be one of caution and hesitation if we had any doubt about the correctness of our position.
('55', 418, 1, 4, 792206) In the case in point, the motive of the exhibitor, no matter how excellent it may be, in my opinion would be no excuse for his exhibition, and the laziness of the spectators in not having thought out the consequences of their presence at such exhibitions is again no excuse for their presence.
('55', 418, 1, 5, 792500) But I must not labour the point any further.
('55', 418, 1, 6, 792545) I thought that as I could not endorse the position taken up by you in your letter 1, I should just place before you my argument for your consideration.

('55', 418, 4, 9, 792763) May 25, 1932
('55', 418, 5, 10, 792776) It is irrelevant to the point of the story either to praise or blame the man who carried the water.
('55', 418, 5, 11, 792876) If you reflect a little, you will see that he could not force the soldiers to drink water.
('55', 418, 5, 12, 792967) Nor is it to the point to ask whether there was enough water for three.
('55', 418, 5, 13, 793039) Each of the first two soldiers, on hearing somebody else crying for water, refused to drink the water before that other soldier had got some.
('55', 418, 5, 14, 793181) Hence we need not blame the man who carried the water for having failed in his duty.
('55', 418, 5, 15, 793266) You do not seem to have visualized the situation.
('55', 418, 5, 16, 793316) When a person is extremely thirsty, he feels such intense craving
('55', 418, 6, 17, 793382) 1 Which read: As for my paragraph about occult powers which you feel might have been stronger, it is curious but I seem to have utterly lost the taste for and the knack of strong writing particularly in criticizing persons.
('55', 418, 6, 18, 793606) When I take my pen intending to hit hard, the picture of the other man stands before my eyes and seems to say: You do not know what I have to say for myself.
('55', 418, 6, 19, 793764) I too have ideals, however much they may be obscured by my conduct.
('55', 418, 6, 20, 793832) Judge me as you would yourself. I avoid all adjectives of judgement as poison and try in all that I say to be completely objective.
('55', 418, 6, 21, 793964) This has become a habit, and I do not doubt that in all circumstances it is a healthy one.
('55', 418, 6, 22, 794055) As regards this particular matter, the thought that after all the man takes his life in his hands weighs my judgment.
('55', 418, 6, 23, 794173) As for the curious crowd, they, I suppose, find relief from the tyranny of daily circumstances in witnessing facts which show or seem to show that one man at least is able to rise above them. (The Diary of Mahadev Desai, Vol. I, p.

('55', 419, 1, 2, 794677) for water that he does not care for anybody else and, if he himself gets any water, gulps it down.
('55', 419, 1, 3, 794776) In this case the poor soldiers were nearing death.
('55', 419, 1, 4, 794827) But even at that time they did not forget their goodness, which means that they remained in a spiritual state right to the end.
('55', 419, 1, 5, 794955) The man who carried the water was quite helpless.
('55', 419, 1, 6, 795005) In any case, was it possible for him to enter into argument with the wounded soldiers, who were drawing their last breath?
('55', 419, 1, 7, 795128) If you think over all this and reflect a little, you will realize that this, which actually occurred, is an example of sublime and perfect self sacrifice, and that the man who carried the water and accidentally became the cause of their death deserves no criticism at all.
('55', 419, 1, 8, 795401) Generally, we do not come across such perfect examples in history.
('55', 419, 1, 9, 795468) There is always some imperfection or other.

('55', 419, 5, 18, 795769) Remember a noble verse which our people often recite:
('55', 419, 6, 19, 795823) That which goes by the name of adversity is not such; nor is that prosperity which goes by that name.
('55', 419, 6, 20, 795925) To forget God is adversity; ever to think of him is prosperity.
('55', 419, 7, 21, 795989) That is, what people call misery is not real misery and what they call happiness is nothing of the sort.
('55', 419, 7, 22, 796094) Real misery is forgetting God that is, Truth, and real happiness is remembering Him.

('55', 420, 3, 4, 796591) Please tell Darbari that there was no need for him to give up the kasti 1 and sadra 2, and that it would be proper for him to resume them as soon as he returned home.
('55', 420, 3, 5, 796758) There is no sin in wearing them, nor is it superstitious to do so.
('55', 420, 3, 6, 796825) By wearing them he does no harm to anybody, but by not wearing them he gives pain to other Parsis.
('55', 420, 3, 7, 796924) It does not befit a servant of the people to give pain to anybody needlessly, and moreover such behaviour is a violation of ahimsa.
('55', 420, 3, 8, 797056) It should be enough if one does not attach undue importance to these things.
('55', 420, 3, 9, 797133) One should not idolize them, and he does not do that.
('55', 420, 3, 10, 797187) The two things are only outward signs of ones being a Parsi, and I do not think it desirable from any point of view to discard them.
('55', 420, 3, 11, 797320) I have asked Dahyabhai to bring for him books containing the teachings of Zoroaster.
('55', 420, 3, 12, 797405) I have read Zoroasters sayings.
('55', 420, 3, 13, 797437) I read a translation of the Vendidad 3 many years ago.
('55', 420, 3, 14, 797492) The work is rich in ethical teaching.
('55', 420, 3, 15, 797530) Since Zoroastrianism is a very old faith, it is possible that all its scriptures have not survived and that those which are extant do not contain spiritual knowledge of the same order as the Upanishads and other works do.
('55', 420, 3, 16, 797752) Darbari should read the extant works and reflect over them.
('55', 420, 3, 17, 797812) But even today it is accepted that Zoroasters teaching is based on that of the Vedas.
('55', 420, 3, 18, 797898) As far as I remember, the translator of the Vendidad has pointed out a close similarity between Zend and Sanskrit.
('55', 420, 3, 19, 798013) It is, therefore, in no way derogatory to Zoroastrianism or to the self respect of the Parsi community to fill in the deficiencies which may be observed in the Parsi scriptures with the help of the Vedas and the Upanishads.
('55', 420, 3, 20, 798237) In fact, it is our right, even our duty, while adhering to our own religion, to accept from other religions anything which specially appeals to us.
('55', 420, 3, 21, 798385) It is fanaticism to think that we cannot adopt anything from other religions, and Darbari and all of us have grown out of it.

('55', 421, 2, 3, 798711) May 25, 1932
('55', 421, 3, 4, 798724) What do you mean by asserting that there is no guiding force in the universe?
('55', 421, 3, 5, 798802) How can we make such an assertion?
('55', 421, 3, 6, 798837) My statement seems to have been somewhat twisted in this context.
('55', 421, 3, 7, 798903) I have only said that Truth is identical with God and you may take it to be the Moving Spirit.
('55', 421, 3, 8, 798998) In this context karta 2 does not have the meaning we usually attribute to it.
('55', 421, 3, 9, 799076) Therefore Truth is karta as well as akarta 3. But this is only an intellectual explanation.
('55', 421, 3, 10, 799168) There is nothing wrong in this matter in believing whatever ones heart accepts, as no man has perfect knowledge of God nor can he express whatever little knowledge he has.
('55', 421, 3, 11, 799340) It is true that I do not depend upon my intellect to decide upon any action.
('55', 421, 3, 12, 799417) For me the reasoned course of action is held in check subject to the sanction of the inner voice.
('55', 421, 3, 13, 799515) I do not know if others would call it the mysterious power or whatsoever.
('55', 421, 3, 14, 799589) I have never deliberated upon this nor analysed it, I have felt no need of doing so either.
('55', 421, 3, 15, 799681) I have faith, and knowledge, too, that a Power exists beyond reasoning.
('55', 421, 3, 16, 799753) This suffices for me.
('55', 421, 3, 17, 799775) I am unable to clarify this any further as I know nothing more in the matter.

('55', 421, 7, 22, 799940) MIRA, I was waiting for your letter.
('55', 421, 7, 23, 799977) It came today.
('55', 421, 7, 24, 799992) The shock such as you received must be accepted as the common lot of those who would only serve their conscience.
('55', 421, 7, 25, 800106) I shall take no hasty step.
('55', 421, 7, 26, 800134) If, apart from the personal equation, I did not think it to be my duty to stop seeingothers if I could not see you, I would not take that step.

('55', 422, 1, 2, 800593) us wait and see.
('55', 422, 1, 3, 800610) Tulsidass Ramayana is to me a work of great religious merit.
('55', 422, 1, 4, 800671) I have not myself read Griffiths translation 1, but I knew that it was the best available and I am glad you have found it so good.
('55', 422, 1, 5, 800802) Dont you try to make envelopes there?
('55', 422, 1, 6, 800840) 2 It is a fascinating occupation when you have the time.
('55', 422, 1, 7, 800897) If you have weak persons having no occupation, they may try their hands at the thing.
('55', 422, 1, 8, 800983) But not you.
('55', 422, 1, 9, 800996) For you it would be an uneconomic use of time.
('55', 422, 1, 10, 801043) I was again 105 1/2 lb.
('55', 422, 1, 11, 801067) So you see there is no cause for anxiety.
('55', 422, 1, 12, 801109) I have now acquired sufficient control over the Magan wheel to make the work pleasurable.
('55', 422, 1, 13, 801199) I spun 202 rounds in 82 minutes, i.e., 147 rounds per hournot bad for me.
('55', 422, 1, 14, 801273) I hope to do much better still.
('55', 422, 1, 15, 801305) Give my love to the Rollands and tell them I simply enjoyed that letter 3 to the American friend.
('55', 422, 1, 16, 801403) Surely there was nothing [wrong] about it.
('55', 422, 1, 17, 801446) And how can there be anything wrong in an honest expression of opinion?
('55', 422, 1, 18, 801518) Love to you all from us all.

('55', 422, 3, 24, 801755) Why, then, should he go on worrying?
('55', 422, 3, 25, 801792) His father is under the care of the great Father of us all.
('55', 422, 3, 26, 801852) At present Chhotubhai is exempted by Him from serving as His instrument and nursing his father.
('55', 422, 3, 27, 801948) He need not, therefore, think about the matter.
('55', 422, 3, 28, 801996) It is a weakness to lose ones peace of mind.
('55', 422, 3, 29, 802041) None of us can be wholly free from that weakness, but the more clearly we realize that we control nothing the more we shall enjoy peace of mind.

('55', 423, 2, 3, 802568) May 26, 1932
('55', 423, 3, 4, 802581) BHAI GHANSHYAMDAS, I have your letter.
('55', 423, 3, 5, 802620) The letter I addressed to Gwalior was somewhat lengthy.
('55', 423, 3, 6, 802676) I recollect this much but nothing of the contents.
('55', 423, 3, 7, 802727) We must consider the views of the workers regarding working in three shifts and also the extent of the material and moral benefit to them from it.
('55', 423, 3, 8, 802874) If they gain materially but lose morally, it will not be acceptable to me.
('55', 423, 3, 9, 802949) I may be considered neutral as I have at present no means of ascertaining labours point of view.
('55', 423, 3, 10, 803046) I only hope that this change has been made with due regard for the labourers attitude towards it.
('55', 423, 3, 11, 803144) I have received two books.
('55', 423, 3, 12, 803171) By two books is meant one pamphlet and the proof of your speech.
('55', 423, 3, 13, 803236) Is it not?
('55', 423, 3, 14, 803247) These two are with me.
('55', 423, 3, 15, 803270) I have not been able to read them so far, as I could not take time off from the work on hand.
('55', 423, 3, 16, 803364) I had to devote a good deal of time to working the charkha with the foot owing to pain in the left hand.
('55', 423, 3, 17, 803469) And moreover I have taken up the study of Urdu.
('55', 423, 3, 18, 803517) I shall now possibly save some time and use it for reading the two items.
('55', 423, 3, 19, 803591) I distinguish between optimism and simplicity of heart.
('55', 423, 3, 20, 803647) Panditji 1 is endowed with both.
('55', 423, 3, 21, 803680) That person is an optimist who continues to hope despite the discouraging signs on the horizon and his own knowledge of them.
('55', 423, 3, 22, 803806) This quality can be found in Panditji in plenty.
('55', 423, 3, 23, 803855) To accept in good faith someones encouraging utterances is simplicity of heart.
('55', 423, 3, 24, 803935) Panditji possesses that too, which in my opinion is undesirable.
('55', 423, 3, 25, 804000) Panditji, by virtue of his nobility, has come to no harm on account of this quality.
('55', 423, 3, 26, 804085) But we should not emulate it.
('55', 423, 3, 27, 804115) Optimism is dependent upon the inner voice while credulousness is dependent upon external factors.
('55', 423, 3, 28, 804214) I am not qualified to give any opinion on foreign travel.
('55', 423, 3, 29, 804272) Ordinarily my views are well known.
('55', 423, 3, 30, 804308) My diet continues to be the same.
('55', 423, 3, 31, 804342) The weight too is steady.

('55', 424, 3, 4, 804540) BHAI KRISHNACHANDRA I have your letter.
('55', 424, 3, 5, 804580) The man who has faith in God will never go to astrologers.
('55', 424, 3, 6, 804639) Therefore in my view no action in deference to their prediction is called for.
('55', 424, 3, 7, 804718) In fact I have observed on many occasions events happening contrary to the predictions and honest astrologers do admit that predictions merely indicate the possibility.
('55', 424, 3, 8, 804887) Thus undoubtedly there is sufficient scope for individual effort.
('55', 424, 3, 9, 804953) The meaning of the Gita, III.
('55', 424, 3, 10, 804983) 33 is clear enough; our basic nature cannot be altered.
('55', 424, 3, 11, 805039) The English saying that the leopard cannot change his spots also supports it.
('55', 424, 3, 12, 805117) What is true of the skin is true of the inside too.
('55', 424, 3, 13, 805169) That is why so many people are unable, in spite of great efforts, to change qualities ingrained in their nature.
('55', 424, 3, 14, 805282) Gulkand 1 can be taken in place of dates, raisins, etc., but it can never be as beneficial.
('55', 424, 3, 15, 805374) It is difficult to specify the quantity; everyone has to find that by experience.

('55', 424, 7, 19, 805556) May [27] 2, 1932
('55', 424, 8, 20, 805573) MY DEAR VERRIER, Ask and ye shall receive has been verified once more.
('55', 424, 8, 21, 805644) Your lovely letter arrived here today.
('55', 424, 8, 22, 805683) I read it after five and today being Friday, without any prompting from me, Mahadev gave effect to your sugggestion about fellowship by singing Lead Kindly Light in its very beautiful Gujarati version.
('55', 424, 8, 23, 805885) At the evening service it is always Mahadevs part to sing the bhajan.
('55', 424, 8, 24, 805955) The hour would be approximately 7.40. The prayer commences at 7.30 and opens with the 19 verses at the end of the second discourse of the Gita.
('55', 424, 8, 25, 806099) It is followed by Ramanama and then comes the bhajan.
('55', 424, 8, 26, 806153) As soon as I read
('55', 424, 9, 27, 806171) 1 A preparation made from rose petals and sugar 2 From the reference in the letter to Friday, which fell on May 27. The source, however, has 26.
('55', 425, 0, 1, 806316) 426 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 425, 1, 2, 806358) your suggestion I had no hesitation in endorsing it, but I was debating as to the choice of the hymn.
('55', 425, 1, 3, 806460) I had in mind the singing of the English text and so the choice was limited.
('55', 425, 1, 4, 806537) It could either be Lead Kindly Light or When I Survey the Wondrous Cross or Take My Life And Let It Be for the simple reason that I myself cannot very well sing any of the other favourite hymns of minenot that even these three I sing accurately.
('55', 425, 1, 5, 806783) But it would be a fair approach to the tune as I have heard it.
('55', 425, 1, 6, 806847) Mahadev is unused to the tune of English hymns, but by thinking of taking up the Gujarati version of Lead Kindly Light, Mahadev solved the difficulty about the choice and singing.
('55', 425, 1, 7, 807027) There is a special fitness about the choice of this hymn of Newmans.
('55', 425, 1, 8, 807096) It was that hymn which, when I was in physical distress, was sung to me by Olive Doke in Johannesburg under the late Rev.
('55', 425, 1, 9, 807218) Dokes roof.
('55', 425, 2, 10, 807230) So you may take it that we shall be here singing this hymn at 7.40 every Friday evening with the knowledge that you at least will be joining us wherever you are, whether the suggestion is taken up or not by the other friends.
('55', 425, 2, 11, 807456) Let there be no Press publicity about this at the present moment.
('55', 425, 2, 12, 807522) I do not know that the Government will appreciate it and from my place as a prisoner I would not like to do a single thing that they would not approve of, unless of course I had to engage in an open quarrel with them in any vital matter.
('55', 425, 2, 13, 807760) I shall be asking Narandas to sing this bhajan on Fridays at the Ashram prayer which during summer months always begins at 7.30. Yes, I like very much, if only for the sake of the old lady and Eldyth 2, the idea of your going to England for a few months and you certainly need the change for the sake of your health.
('55', 425, 2, 14, 808077) And since you should be going, the sooner you leave the better.
('55', 425, 2, 15, 808141) I do not like the idea of Mother and Eldyth coming to village India or any other India.
('55', 425, 2, 16, 808229) The spirit with them may be willing but the flesh will not respond.
('55', 425, 2, 17, 808297) You yourself are no bright example in this respect, and it would be unwise to put the strain on them of settling down in India.
('55', 425, 2, 18, 808425) It would be however a wholly different thing if, independently of any prompting on your or anybody elses part, they felt the clearest possible call from within.
('55', 425, 2, 19, 808586) But in that case, there would be no question of seeking or accepting advice from any quarter.
('55', 425, 2, 20, 808680) Such cases have of course happened before now.
('55', 425, 2, 21, 808727) There the spirit surmounts

('55', 426, 5, 14, 809648) May 27, 1932
('55', 426, 6, 15, 809661) In a long letter to Devdas Gandhi, Bapu paid a generous tribute to Narandas Gandhi, the Ashram Secretary, who, by his firmness, patience, courage, renun ciation and good judgement, has relieved all my anxiety about the Ashram. .
('55', 426, 6, 16, 809890) As regards his Urdu studies, Bapu wrote to Devdas Gandhi: There are lessons on history in each reader.
('55', 426, 6, 17, 809993) Some of them deal with the Prophet and his times, while others are concerned with Muslim rulers in India.
('55', 426, 6, 18, 810099) The standpoint from which these are written should be understood by everyone.
('55', 426, 6, 19, 810177) I have an increasing realization of the importance of Urdu studies.
('55', 426, 6, 20, 810245) By learning to write a language in its own script we can write letters in it.
('55', 426, 6, 21, 810323) Moreover we thus also acquire greater mastery over the language, and are better able to decipher as well as understand letters received by us.
('55', 426, 6, 22, 810466) I believe we should learn how to write Urdu letters to Muslim co workers.
('55', 426, 6, 23, 810540) If we are compelled to write to them in English, Hindi can never take its legitimate place as the national language.
('55', 426, 6, 24, 810657) That is why I think that ability to write in Urdu is an essential part of our mental equipment.
('55', 426, 7, 25, 810753) He then referred to the circumstances in which he began to write Urdu letters to Raihana Tyabji and said:

('55', 427, 5, 7, 811236) MY DEAR AMTUL, I have read both your letters.
('55', 427, 5, 8, 811282) Your Urdu writing is not clear enough for me.
('55', 427, 5, 9, 811328) I gave nearly an hour to it and could only get the substance of your letter.
('55', 427, 5, 10, 811405) I gather that it is only a paraphrase of your English letter.
('55', 427, 5, 11, 811467) If you can keep your head cool and composed, I think you should stay with the family for the time being and then go to the Ashram.
('55', 427, 5, 12, 811598) If you find it impossible to be at peace with yourself living with your people, you should stay with Noorbanu.
('55', 427, 5, 13, 811709) Does this answer all your questions?
('55', 427, 5, 14, 811746) If not, write again and that in English.
('55', 427, 5, 15, 811787) Write partly in Urdu also.
('55', 427, 5, 16, 811814) I shall write to Dr. Sharma.
('55', 427, 5, 17, 811843) I was glad you were able to come.
('55', 427, 5, 18, 811877) You must regain the lost weight.

('55', 427, 10, 22, 811982) PANDITJI, I doubt if there was any moral obligation on the pupils of your guru, the late Panditji, to do something in his memory and pay their debt to him.
('55', 427, 10, 23, 812138) But, since all of you felt that something must be done, you were bound to do what you did.
('55', 427, 10, 24, 812229) Write a letter to Lakshmibehn and send it with somebody there who may be coming this way.
('55', 427, 10, 25, 812319) Or ask Narandas to write.
('55', 427, 10, 26, 812345) Sometimes I come to know about a thing only after it is over.
('55', 427, 10, 27, 812407) I hope Rambhau is all right now.

('55', 428, 1, 2, 812513) I look upon the problem of untouchability from a purely religious point of view.
('55', 428, 1, 3, 812594) There must be, therefore, no separate electorates in any case.
('55', 428, 1, 4, 812657) But the reservation of seats for them, if it is statutory, will not test the caste Hindus and, therefore, will not be a real prayashchitta 1 on their part.
('55', 428, 1, 5, 812813) We cannot bargain with the untouchables.
('55', 428, 1, 6, 812854) What is necessary is that the suspicion which they harbour in their minds should go.
('55', 428, 1, 7, 812939) If you still do not understand my position, please ask me again.
('55', 428, 1, 8, 813004) Please take care that these views do not find their way into print in any circumstances.
('55', 428, 1, 9, 813093) There is a possibility of the visits coming to a stop.

('55', 428, 6, 14, 813332) Such accidents happen to anyone who does physical exercises.
('55', 428, 6, 15, 813393) I hope the bone has now been properly set.
('55', 428, 6, 16, 813436) Your reply was very helpful to me.
('55', 428, 6, 17, 813471) Following your suggestion, I have been able to stop touching the wheel with the hand.
('55', 428, 6, 18, 813557) I have understood the trick, though I have not yet mastered it.
('55', 428, 6, 19, 813621) You still make mistakes in your Gujarati.
('55', 428, 6, 20, 813663) Avoid them and improve your handwriting.
('55', 428, 6, 21, 813704) My compliments to you on regaining your weight.
('55', 428, 6, 22, 813752) When you are entrusted with a responsible job, look upon it as an opportunity to render more service and to be more humble.
('55', 428, 6, 23, 813876) Monetary help should be given only to a person who is really in need of it.
('55', 428, 6, 24, 813952) And it is properly given when it is given at the right time and without any feeling of pride that one was helping somebody.
('55', 428, 6, 25, 814076) Non violence means that we should not give pain to anybody for our good.
('55', 428, 6, 26, 814149) It comprises both such a state of mind and such conduct.

('55', 429, 12, 22, 815422) I shall read it as soon as I can.

('55', 430, 1, 2, 815690) suspension of current work.
('55', 430, 1, 3, 815718) Feeling is of the heart.
('55', 430, 1, 4, 815743) It may easily lead us astray unless we would keep the heart pure.
('55', 430, 1, 5, 815809) It is like keeping house and everything in it clean.
('55', 430, 1, 6, 815862) The heart is the source from which knowledge of God springs.
('55', 430, 1, 7, 815923) If the source is contaminated, every other remedy is useless.
('55', 430, 1, 8, 815985) And if its purity is assured nothing else is needed.

('55', 430, 4, 29, 816884) The other is amusement for those who have no service.
('55', 430, 4, 30, 816938) One would think that here at least one would have plenty of time to read.
('55', 430, 4, 31, 817012) Well, spinning and preparatory studies leave little time for reading for amusement.
('55', 430, 4, 32, 817096) But I must stop this lecturing.
('55', 430, 4, 33, 817128) Are you keeping well?

('55', 430, 4, 35, 817184) The Governments reply regarding her is that I am not to see her.
('55', 430, 4, 36, 817249) Evidently they think that she is taking an active part in politics or that she suffers from contamination.

('55', 431, 3, 5, 817783) I was happy that all of you came and saw me.
('55', 431, 3, 6, 817828) Of course, we did not have much to talk about, and in any case the time was too short.
('55', 431, 3, 7, 817915) I deliberately did not give time to Sushila alone.
('55', 431, 3, 8, 817966) Whatever timewas permitted to me had to be divided among you, Amtul and Sharda.
('55', 431, 3, 9, 818046) Did Sushila have anything particular to ask me?
('55', 431, 3, 10, 818094) In their letters to me, I am afraid the boys and the girls put to me all sorts of pointless questions, and that too merely for the sake of asking some questions.
('55', 431, 3, 11, 818256) Explain this carefully to them once.
('55', 431, 3, 12, 818293) Writing letters also requires to be taught to some extent.

('55', 433, 9, 22, 821351) If possible, write in ink.
('55', 433, 9, 23, 821378) Did you take it down while Vinoba was discoursing or did Vinoba himself write it out?
('55', 433, 9, 24, 821464) Training in takli is progressing well.
('55', 433, 9, 25, 821503) It will be very good if all the Ashram inmates learn it.
('55', 433, 9, 26, 821560) The silence period was lengthened from one minute to five minutes in order to give people greater peace.
('55', 433, 9, 27, 821665) 3 It appears that all the people were much too distracted.
('55', 433, 9, 28, 821724) Concentration will be greatly helped if all observe silence with a willing heart.

('55', 434, 1, 2, 821940) To meditate upon the image of a living person is not proper.
('55', 434, 1, 3, 822001) The object of concentration is expected to be, and ought to be, perfect, but how can we call any living person perfect?
('55', 434, 1, 4, 822121) The illustrations in the Ramayana and similar works are worthless.
('55', 434, 1, 5, 822188) But why do we need a concrete image?
('55', 434, 1, 6, 822225) God is without form or attributes.
('55', 434, 1, 7, 822260) Why not concentrate ones thoughts on Him?
('55', 434, 1, 8, 822302) If that is impossible, a form or an imaginary figure, may be meditated upon.
('55', 434, 1, 9, 822379) Why not meditate upon the Gita?
('55', 434, 1, 10, 822411) It has been compared to the kamadhenu.
('55', 434, 1, 11, 822450) Let us meditate on this; we can gain much from it.
('55', 434, 1, 12, 822501) However it be, meditation upon living persons is harmful; so it should be avoided.
('55', 434, 1, 13, 822584) Write to Rameshwarji that I have already sent him three or four letters.
('55', 434, 1, 14, 822657) Krishnadas informed me that Vinoba had started grinding flour and that Jamnalalji had lost 20 lb.
('55', 434, 1, 15, 822755) in weight.
('55', 434, 1, 16, 822766) Here are some remedies for constipation.
('55', 434, 1, 17, 822807) They can all be tried simultaneously.
('55', 434, 1, 18, 822845) 1. Drink hot water with salt and lemon juice in the morning; Salt can be substituted by jaggery or honey.
('55', 434, 1, 19, 822951) 2. Sleep with an abdominal mud pack at night.
('55', 434, 1, 20, 822997) 3. Give up pulses for some time.
('55', 434, 1, 21, 823030) If you do not benefit with this treatment within three days, follow it up by eating only boiled greens for the next three days.
('55', 434, 1, 22, 823158) Eat them hot.
('55', 434, 1, 23, 823172) Tandalja is the best among the greens.
('55', 434, 1, 24, 823211) You can take salt and lemon juice on it.
('55', 434, 2, 25, 823252) Blessings from

('55', 434, 5, 27, 823346) 529. LESSON OF DEATH 1
('55', 434, 6, 28, 823369) May 30, 1932 So far as I remember, the following deaths have occurred in the Ashram till now: Fakiri, Vrajlal, Maganlal, Gita, Meghji, Vasant, Imam Saheb and Gangadevi.
('55', 434, 6, 29, 823538) (It would be desirable to record the dates on which these persons died).
('55', 434, 7, 30, 823611) 1 This was sent along with Letter to Narandas Gandhi, 26/30 5 1932; vide the following item.
('55', 435, 0, 1, 823704) 436 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 435, 1, 2, 823746) Fakiris death cannot be described as one befitting an inmate of the Ashram.
('55', 435, 1, 3, 823822) The Ashram had been recently established when he died and he had not imbibed its moral and spiritual influence.
('55', 435, 1, 4, 823934) He was no doubt a brave boy.
('55', 435, 1, 5, 823963) I have made the foregoing remark as he died a victim of gluttony.
('55', 435, 1, 6, 824029) His death was a test for me.
('55', 435, 1, 7, 824058) I remember that I sat up, alone, by his side for the whole night on the last day of his life.
('55', 435, 1, 8, 824152) In the morning, I had to catch a train for Gurukul.
('55', 435, 1, 9, 824204) I watched the bier being borne away and then, hardening my heart to stone, took the road to the station.
('55', 435, 1, 10, 824309) Fakiris father had entrusted him and his three brothers to me, knowing that I would make no distinction between them and others.
('55', 435, 1, 11, 824438) When Fakiri had gone, I lost the other three brothers too.
('55', 435, 1, 12, 824497) Vrajlal had joined the Ashram when he was well advanced in years and met his death while doing an act of service, thus winning immortal fame for himself and bringing glory to the Ashram.
('55', 435, 1, 13, 824684) He had descended into a well to bring up a childs pot and, while climbing up, because of fatigue lost his grip of the rope and fell and died.
('55', 435, 1, 14, 824826) Gita passed away peacefully, hearing verses from the Gita.
('55', 435, 1, 15, 824885) Meghji was an undisciplined child, but he preserved wonderful peace during his illness.
('55', 435, 1, 16, 824973) In most cases children suffer a great deal when seriously ill and are difficult patients to nurse.
('55', 435, 1, 17, 825072) But Meghji was an almost ideal patient.
('55', 435, 1, 18, 825112) Vasant did not have to be nursed for a long time.
('55', 435, 1, 19, 825162) A fatal attack of smallpox carried him away in a day or two.
('55', 435, 1, 20, 825223) His death was a painful test for Panditji and Lakshmibehn, and they stood it well.
('55', 435, 1, 21, 825306) What shall I say about Maganlal?
('55', 435, 1, 22, 825339) We are describing here the deaths which occurred in the Ashram.
('55', 435, 1, 23, 825403) Hence Maganlals name has no place in the list.
('55', 435, 1, 24, 825450) But how can I leave it out?
('55', 435, 1, 25, 825478) He had come into the world to serve the Ashram.
('55', 435, 1, 26, 825526) As gold is tested in fire, Maganlal was tested in the fire of service, and passed away after proving his perfect worth.
('55', 435, 1, 27, 825646) Everything that we see in the Ashram bears witness to Maganlals devoted service.
('55', 435, 1, 28, 825727) Imam Sahebs was the only Muslim family in the Ashram and all the members were perfectly loyal to its ideals.
('55', 435, 1, 29, 825836) His death has created an unbreakable bond between us and Muslims.
('55', 435, 1, 30, 825902) Imam Saheb regarded himself as a representative of Muslims and had joined the Ashram as one.
('55', 435, 1, 31, 825995) (I remember here Aminas two children.
('55', 435, 1, 32, 826033) But they were only infants and there is little to say about them.
('55', 435, 1, 33, 826099) Their deaths certainly teach us the necessity of self control.)
('55', 436, 0, 1, 826163) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 437
('55', 436, 1, 2, 826209) Gangadevis face is still vivid before my eyes, and I seem to hear her voice too.
('55', 436, 1, 3, 826290) I still take pleasure in recalling memories of her.
('55', 436, 1, 4, 826342) Her life teaches all of us, and particularly women, many lessons.
('55', 436, 1, 5, 826408) Though practically illiterate, she possessed spiritual wisdom.
('55', 436, 1, 6, 826471) She was the only person who, of her own accord, refused to go for change of air though she could have gone.
('55', 436, 1, 7, 826579) She looked after every child entrusted to her care as if it was her own.
('55', 436, 1, 8, 826652) I do not remember any occasion when she had quarrelled with somebody or got angry.
('55', 436, 1, 9, 826735) She was not attached to life.
('55', 436, 1, 10, 826765) She did not fear death she met it with a smile on her face.
('55', 436, 1, 11, 826825) She knew the art of dying, for there is an art of dying as there is of living.
('55', 436, 1, 12, 826904) I have recalled all these deaths lest we forget what we are.
('55', 436, 1, 13, 826965) Our earth is like a particle of sand in this vast universe.
('55', 436, 1, 14, 827025) On that particle of dust we are, so far as our bodies are concerned, mere specks.
('55', 436, 1, 15, 827107) We cannot count the number of ants in an ant hill, and cannot even see with our naked eyes creatures smaller than the ant.
('55', 436, 1, 16, 827230) In relation to the Cosmic Form of the Lord, we are smaller than even the invisible creatures on our earth.
('55', 436, 1, 17, 827337) That is why there is perfect truth in the description of this body as kshanabhangur 1. Why should we be attached to it?
('55', 436, 1, 18, 827457) Why should we cause pain to a single ceature for its sake?
('55', 436, 1, 19, 827516) Why should we move heaven and earth to preserve something which is more brittle even than glass?
('55', 436, 1, 20, 827613) Death means nothing but the soul leaving that body.
('55', 436, 1, 21, 827665) Why should we fear it, then?
('55', 436, 1, 22, 827694) Why all this desperate struggle to delay its coming?
('55', 436, 1, 23, 827747) Let us all, grown up and young, ponder over this constantly and give up the fear of death, and, while the body lasts, spend it in the service of others.
('55', 436, 1, 24, 827900) We recite daily the last 19 verses of Chapter II of the Gita in order that we may get the strength to live in this manner.
('55', 436, 1, 25, 828023) We shall find in them what we seek only if they fill our very hearts.
('55', 436, 1, 26, 828093) After I had finished the foregoing, Mahadev reminds me of the deaths of Fatima, Kaki 2 and Valjis mother.
('55', 436, 1, 27, 828199) But I leave the discourse as it is, since their inclusion would not affect the lesson which I have drawn.
('55', 436, 1, 28, 828305) Even so, I may say that what I was told about these deaths fills my mind with holy thoughts.

('55', 437, 1, 2, 828520) 530. LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI
('55', 437, 2, 3, 828551) May 26/30, 1932
('55', 437, 3, 4, 828567) NARANDAS, Premabehn, Sushila, Amtulbehm, Sharda, Noorbanu and Pyare Ali were here before I got your packet.
('55', 437, 3, 5, 828675) When absolutely necessary you may increase the size of the party from five to six or even seven.
('55', 437, 3, 6, 828772) But ordinarily it would be desirable to stick to five.
('55', 437, 3, 7, 828827) Only this time the number was six, not counting Aminas children.
('55', 437, 3, 8, 828892) I think it will be safer for you to stick to the limit I have given, so that you may not displease anybody.
('55', 437, 3, 9, 829000) Vallabhbhai had concluded that you had dropped your name because there were already five names.
('55', 437, 3, 10, 829096) Whether that is the reason or whether you did not come because you did not think it necessary to come, in either case it was all right.
('55', 437, 3, 11, 829232) Probably, there will be no occasion for you to bear all this in mind.
('55', 437, 3, 12, 829302) I have still not received the Governments decision in regard to Mirabehn.
('55', 437, 3, 13, 829376) If it is in the negative, you may take it that I will stop seeing visitors.
('55', 437, 3, 14, 829452) Lakshmidevi, who is in the prison here, has left her spectacles in the Ashram.
('55', 437, 3, 15, 829531) She has asked me to request you, if you find them, to send them here with somebody.
('55', 437, 3, 16, 829615) If no one is coming, send them by parcel.
('55', 437, 3, 17, 829657) And also send 20 tolas of asafoetida pills along with it.
('55', 437, 3, 18, 829715) When you say that Bas letters were dispatched directly, I suppose you mean that they were sent through the Superintendent.
('55', 437, 3, 19, 829838) If that is so, please inquire there.
('55', 437, 3, 20, 829875) In affixing a stamp on the envelope in which you dispatch letters for me, you generally affix it at one of the two ends where it is closed.
('55', 437, 3, 21, 830015) But unless you affix stamps at both ends, affixing a stamp at one end only serves no useful purpose.
('55', 437, 3, 22, 830116) It would be advisable, therefore, to affix stamps at both ends.
('55', 437, 3, 23, 830180) Either do that, or put sealing wax at both ends.
('55', 437, 3, 24, 830229) Adopt whichever method you like.
('55', 437, 3, 25, 830262) You may certainly discuss with other inmates there my suggestion about calculating the value of work at the rate of one anna per hour, but I think for your own observation you will find it very helpful to maintain such a record in an independent book.
('55', 437, 3, 26, 830514) The books being kept at present will continue to be maintained.
('55', 437, 3, 27, 830578) The one I have suggested will be in addition to them.
('55', 437, 3, 28, 830632) If, however, I have been able to explain my idea, you will see that there is so little to be recorded that the work will not be heavy at all.
('55', 437, 3, 29, 830774) Moreover we shall be able to judge whether there is any truth in what I have been saying.
('55', 437, 3, 30, 830864) If the summary
('55', 438, 0, 1, 830879) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 439
('55', 438, 1, 2, 830925) at the end of a month reveals a great difference between the actual figure of expenditure and the one arrived at by following the method of calculation suggested by me, we may assume that we shall never be able to close the gap and my mind will then start working in some other direction.
('55', 438, 1, 3, 831214) I am confident, however, that such a summary will lead to a conclusion which will surprise us.
('55', 438, 1, 4, 831309) It is my experience that very often because of our lethargy we continue to labour under a mistaken idea, and, if we make proper calculations, we are able to get rid of our preconceived notions and correct our errors.
('55', 438, 1, 5, 831526) Personally, at the moment, I see no error at all in my reasoning and I believe, therefore, that the result will be excellent.
('55', 438, 1, 6, 831652) Since for hundreds of years different types of work have been paid for at different rates, we assume that that is the right thing to do but I think it is a false notion.
('55', 438, 1, 7, 831822) Did you read the latest letter which Harilal wrote to me?
('55', 438, 1, 8, 831880) Even the handwriting is not steady.
('55', 438, 1, 9, 831916) He seems to have written the letter with a trembling hand.
('55', 438, 1, 10, 831975) Either he has written it in great excitement, or he was drunk when he wrote it.
('55', 438, 1, 11, 832055) The language is all excitement and insolence.
('55', 438, 1, 12, 832101) No attention is paid to ordinary syntax, words are left incomplete and even the signature is not completed.
('55', 438, 1, 13, 832209) I think we should completely forget him now.
('55', 438, 1, 14, 832254) If God wills, he will reform himself one day.
('55', 438, 1, 15, 832300) Even in order to open his eyes, it is necessary that we should let him know plainly what we think about him.
('55', 438, 1, 16, 832409) You say that you got both my letters to him.
('55', 438, 1, 17, 832454) Does that mean that you also got the one which we thought had miscarried?
('55', 438, 1, 18, 832528) 1 If you got it, did you examine the postmark on it?
('55', 438, 1, 19, 832581) The electric treatment seems to have had no effect on the hand.
('55', 438, 1, 20, 832645) For the first two days, it seemed that it might really do some good.
('55', 438, 1, 21, 832714) The real trouble just now is not with the right hand but with the left elbow, but the doctor does not give electric treatment for that.
('55', 438, 1, 22, 832850) He has been thinking of giving radium treatment.
('55', 438, 1, 23, 832899) Since I spin on the Magan wheel, I do no work at all with the left hand.
('55', 438, 1, 24, 832972) But there is no cause for worry.
('55', 438, 1, 25, 833005) So far it has been paining only when I work with it.
('55', 438, 1, 26, 833058) At other times there is no pain.
('55', 438, 1, 27, 833091) As for getting Khambhatta here to examine the bone, I cannot say anything just now.
('55', 438, 1, 28, 833175) Permission for him has been received, but it will not be possible for me to avail myself of it if the reply in regard to Mirabehn is in the negative.
('55', 438, 1, 29, 833325) I thought I had sent to you the five nameswhich had already been approved.
('55', 438, 2, 30, 833400) 1 In Letter to E. E. Doyle, 7 5 1932, Gandhiji refers to a letter dated April 28 to an erring son; vide also Diary, 1932, entry under April 28.
('55', 439, 0, 1, 833544) 440 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 439, 1, 2, 833586) know three of them now.
('55', 439, 1, 3, 833610) The other two are Trivedi and Lady Thackersey.
('55', 439, 1, 4, 833657) It would be fine indeed if you think you can look after Jayantiprasads daughter.
('55', 439, 1, 5, 833738) Jayantiprasad gave me the impression, during the Dandi March, that he was careful in observing rules.
('55', 439, 1, 6, 833840) I feel rather unhappy that Chimanlal and Sharda do not improve.
('55', 439, 1, 7, 833904) I write down here the suggestion which occurs to me just now as to what they should do.
('55', 439, 1, 8, 833992) I will not write to them separately.
('55', 439, 1, 9, 834029) Let them take this as addressed to them.
('55', 439, 1, 10, 834070) Shivaji used to keep indifferent health.
('55', 439, 1, 11, 834111) He read all the literature on the subject that he could get, tried the diet changes and exercises recommended in the books which he read and succeeded in improving his health.
('55', 439, 1, 12, 834287) Chimanlal should do something like that.
('55', 439, 1, 13, 834328) I dont mean that all could try everything that Shivaji did.
('55', 439, 1, 14, 834388) But Chimanlal has been in the Ashram for a long time, has thought about the subject and has observed my experiments too.
('55', 439, 1, 15, 834509) It is, therefore, possible that he will hit upon something which his body needs.
('55', 439, 1, 16, 834590) We have plenty of books on the subject in the Ashram.
('55', 439, 1, 17, 834644) There is a small book even on chromopathy.
('55', 439, 1, 18, 834687) This remedy is quite easy to try.
('55', 439, 1, 19, 834721) The doctor 1 whose treatment helped Amtulbehn employs it in many cases.
('55', 439, 1, 20, 834793) Light asana exercises also may help.
('55', 439, 1, 21, 834830) Chimanlal should find some time and read about them.
('55', 439, 1, 22, 834883) According to me, these remedies are more effective than doctors medicines, and they are spiritually harmless.
('55', 439, 1, 23, 834993) We often see that even the latter fail.
('55', 439, 1, 24, 835033) Medical science is altogether imperfect and much of it is based on hypotheses.
('55', 439, 1, 25, 835112) Since the body of every person is a unique organism, we do not at all exaggerate in saying that there are no remedies which are universally applicable.
('55', 439, 1, 26, 835264) About Sharda, I think that we know the remedies but they have not all been tried.
('55', 439, 1, 27, 835346) She also may be partly responsible for this.
('55', 439, 1, 28, 835391) You should gently persuade her to try them.
('55', 439, 1, 29, 835435) I think it was a very good thing that Jamna went to Ranavav.
('55', 439, 1, 30, 835496) Since Purushottam is with her, you will not have to worry about her at all.
('55', 439, 1, 31, 835572) Parnerkars problem is very complicated.
('55', 439, 1, 32, 835612) Do what you can.
('55', 439, 1, 33, 835629) Read my letter to Titus.
('55', 439, 1, 34, 835654) Compared with the heat there, the heat here is a joke.
('55', 439, 1, 35, 835709) Hence our tapascharya, both outward and inward, is no real tapascharya.
('55', 439, 1, 36, 835781) Yours deserves to be envied.
('55', 439, 1, 37, 835810) I hope and pray that you will survive it.
('55', 439, 1, 38, 835852) If all my letters are not translated into Hindi, make it a strict rule that they must be.

('55', 440, 1, 3, 836162) May 30, 1932
('55', 440, 2, 4, 836175) I had written one letter to Savitribehn, that is, Mrs. Standenath, and put on it the address given by her.
('55', 440, 2, 5, 836282) But the letter has been returned from the D.L.O. I am now sending it to you, along with the envelope.
('55', 440, 2, 6, 836384) If you have more particulars of her address, use it and send the letter by registered post.
('55', 440, 2, 7, 836476) She must be awaiting a letter from me and, having got no reply from me, must be feeling unhappy.
('55', 440, 2, 8, 836573) If you find her full address, please send it to me too.
('55', 440, 2, 9, 836629) Father Elwin has suggested that we should recite a Christian prayer here every Friday, and that his Christian friends will sing the same prayer on that day and at the same time.
('55', 440, 2, 10, 836807) They would thus cultivate a communion of hearts with us.
('55', 440, 2, 11, 836864) Mahadev accepted the suggestion as soon as we read his letter last Friday and we replied to it with Premal Jyoti 1. Hence we have fixed upon that hymn as the one we will sing every Friday.
('55', 440, 2, 12, 837053) Discuss the matter with Panditji and, if he agrees, sing it every Friday there too at the time of evening prayers.
('55', 440, 2, 13, 837168) You will observe that I have now resumed writing with my right hand.
('55', 440, 2, 14, 837237) The doctors here are strongly of the view that the left elbow requires complete rest.
('55', 440, 2, 15, 837323) Failing this, they think gradually the pain will increase.
('55', 440, 2, 16, 837382) I have, therefore, given up even writing with the left hand.
('55', 440, 2, 17, 837443) In a day or two, they will put the whole arm in plaster.
('55', 440, 2, 18, 837500) Dont get alarmed on reading this, for the elbow has never pained so far except when I have been working with the left hand.
('55', 440, 2, 19, 837624) The arm is to be put into plaster only as a precaution.
('55', 440, 2, 20, 837680) The doctors are convinced that this pain has no connection with my diet.
('55', 440, 2, 21, 837753) People who play tennis also get such pain sometimes, and the doctors believe that, because of my regular spinning for many years, I have strained the elbow much more than tennis players do.
('55', 440, 2, 22, 837943) Hence they think that it requires complete rest for some time.

('55', 441, 2, 3, 838207) May 30, 1932
('55', 441, 3, 4, 838220) DEAR SISTER, I thank you for your letter.
('55', 441, 3, 5, 838262) I well remember the visit of Sir Henry Lawrence to this prison in 1922 or 23, and he is right in his impression that I then passed my time principally between reading The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire and spinning at the wheel.
('55', 441, 3, 6, 838497) It is also true that he found me quite happy.
('55', 441, 3, 7, 838543) But there was no lovely orchard then, nor is there now.
('55', 441, 3, 8, 838599) There were then, as there are now, some tall trees about.
('55', 441, 3, 9, 838657) The rooms are bare and barred cells of an ordinary Indian prison.
('55', 441, 3, 10, 838723) As cells they are well lighted and well ventilated.
('55', 441, 3, 11, 838775) So long therefore as the surroundings are concerned, there is no question of my memory betraying me, for at the time of writing I am exactly in the same surroundings as when Sir Henry saw me.
('55', 441, 3, 12, 838967) If therefore his description of them gave you the impression of a fairy tale, it was surely erroneous.
('55', 441, 3, 13, 839070) Happiness after all is a mental state, and for myself, being used, now for more than a generation, to a hard life, I have learnt to detach my happiness from my surroundings.
('55', 441, 4, 14, 839244) Yours sincerely, M. K. GANDHI

('55', 441, 8, 19, 839437) The previous letter you refer to was not received at all.
('55', 441, 8, 20, 839495) I would have attended to it there and then.
('55', 441, 8, 21, 839539) Sardar Vallabhbhai who is present whilst I am dictating this and who has shared all the correspondence with me has also no recollection whatsoever of anything having been received from you.
('55', 441, 8, 22, 839729) However I know no one in Vienna.
('55', 441, 8, 23, 839762) I have never been there.
('55', 441, 8, 24, 839787) But I haveno doubt that when you tell the specialist the whole of your story he will treat your case as he must have treated similar cases before.

('55', 442, 5, 11, 840667) I do not conceive religion as one of the many activities of mankind.
('55', 442, 5, 12, 840736) The same activity may be either governed by the spirit of religion or irreligion.
('55', 442, 5, 13, 840818) There is no such thing for me therefore as leaving politics for religion.
('55', 442, 5, 14, 840892) For me, every, the tiniest, activity is governed by what I consider to be my religion.

('55', 443, 6, 7, 841756) I hope that you got my last letter which I wrote before you wrote yours and which I sent to you through the Ashram.
('55', 443, 6, 8, 841872) Stick to the vow of spinning.
('55', 443, 6, 9, 841902) Do not take any new vow until your mind has become firm.
('55', 443, 6, 10, 841959) However, adhere with the utmost firmness to the vows which you have taken and maintained so far.
('55', 443, 6, 11, 842056) Even a small vow becomes a rudder to the ship of ones life, if one sticks to it in the face of all difficulties.
('55', 443, 6, 12, 842169) It will be all right if you can win over your mother and sister in law with loving persuasion, otherwise you should patiently tolerate their opposition.
('55', 443, 6, 13, 842322) They should not be forced against their wishes.
('55', 443, 6, 14, 842370) It will be good if you send the boy to the Gurukul at Kangri.
('55', 443, 6, 15, 842432) There he will learn Hindi, Sanskrit and English and almost everything else that they teach at a high school.
('55', 443, 6, 16, 842541) If he is unwilling to go to the Gurukul, he may go to Santiniketan.
('55', 443, 6, 17, 842609) In that case he should learn Bengali.
('55', 443, 6, 18, 842647) If even that does not suit him, he may join the Kashi Vishvavidyalaya.
('55', 443, 6, 19, 842718) He will not be able to study at home.
('55', 443, 6, 20, 842756) Since you have withdrawn him from the high school there, it would not be proper to send him back to it.
('55', 443, 6, 21, 842860) Nor would it be right to interrupt his studies.
('55', 443, 6, 22, 842908) It would, therefore, be desirable to send him to one of the three places mentioned above.

('55', 444, 1, 2, 843213) 536. A LETTER 1
('55', 444, 2, 3, 843229) May 30, 1932 I believe, and doctors also hold the same view, that no woman can be absolutely and simply raped.
('55', 444, 2, 4, 843340) Not being prepared to die, a woman yields to the wrongdoer.
('55', 444, 2, 5, 843400) But a woman who has overcome all fear of death would die before submitting to the outrage.
('55', 444, 2, 6, 843491) It is easy to say this, but difficult to act in this manner.
('55', 444, 2, 7, 843552) Hence when a woman yields to the wrongdoer unwillingly, it is but right that we should regard her as having been raped.
('55', 444, 2, 8, 843672) If such a woman becomes pregnant, she should not resort to abortion.
('55', 444, 2, 9, 843741) A woman who has been the victim of a rape does not deserve any censure.
('55', 444, 2, 10, 843813) On the contrary, people should have compassion for her.
('55', 444, 2, 11, 843869) If, however, a woman wishes to conceal the very fact of her having been raped, who is to say what right she has, whether or not she has a right to resort to abortion?
('55', 444, 2, 12, 844036) In her fright she would believe that she had such a right and do as she wished.
('55', 444, 2, 13, 844116) After the outrage, a woman has no right at all to commit suicide, nor need she do it.
('55', 444, 2, 14, 844202) My replies to your letters or to the letters of others, being written from jail, must not be published.
('55', 444, 2, 15, 844306) I write numerous letters from here and it would not at all be proper to publish them.
('55', 444, 2, 16, 844392) The Government may even tolerate the publication of all these letters, but a satyagrahi ought not to take such freedom.
('55', 444, 2, 17, 844512) This is one of the restrictions which a satyagrahi voluntarily imposes on himself.
('55', 444, 2, 18, 844595) The world is not impatient to know my views and act according to them.
('55', 444, 2, 19, 844666) Even if it is, it should exercise patience at present.
('55', 444, 2, 20, 844721) Nor do I myself attach so much value to my views.
('55', 444, 2, 21, 844771) And, moreover, I cannot say about any view which I may express now that I will not change it in future.
('55', 444, 2, 22, 844875) I may not mind expressing my personal views to a person like you.
('55', 444, 2, 23, 844941) I would assume that you would bear in mind my temperament and my short comings and take them for what they are worth.
('55', 444, 2, 24, 845059) And now about the questions you put.
('55', 444, 2, 25, 845096) Some of them are such as should not be asked at all.
('55', 444, 2, 26, 845149) A seeker may ask a person in whom he has faith for solutions to a very few of his immediate difficulties.
('55', 444, 2, 27, 845255) He should never raise hypothetical issues.
('55', 444, 2, 28, 845298) He may certainly ask if he has any doubt about a step which he intends to take.
('55', 444, 2, 29, 845378) If he asks a question

('55', 445, 1, 2, 845534) about something which has really happened, he should give all details of the incident.
('55', 445, 1, 3, 845621) He should not frame a general question on the basis of the incident, for in doing so he might ignore some relevant detail of that incident.
('55', 445, 1, 4, 845761) It would be risky, in that case, to apply to that particular incident the reply given to a general question.

('55', 467, 7, 18, 887710) June 1, 1932
('55', 467, 8, 19, 887723) MIRA, 1
('55', 467, 9, 20, 887731) Your letter arrived today.
('55', 467, 9, 21, 887758) I have now decided to stop the interviews from next week if the decision is delayed 2. They will be resumed if the decision is favourable.
('55', 467, 10, 22, 887897) The left elbow has proved worse than the right hand.
('55', 467, 10, 23, 887950) All work with the left elbow has stopped and presently it will be packed in splints.
('55', 467, 10, 24, 888035) Doctors are sure that it is nothing but the strain caused by the uninterrupted working of the wheel from day to day.
('55', 467, 10, 25, 888152) I am thankful that I have now acquired full control over the Magan wheel.
('55', 467, 10, 26, 888226) Spinning, therefore, continues and will continue merrily, unless the right elbow strikes from sympathy.
('55', 467, 11, 27, 888330) 1 Superscription in this and other letters to Mirabehn is in Devanagari.
('55', 467, 11, 28, 888403) 2 Gandhiji had requested the Government to reconsider their decision not to permit Mirabehn to see him in Yeravda Jail as otherwise he might not avail himself of the permission to receive other visitors; vide Letter to E.

('55', 468, 0, 1, 888684) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 469
('55', 468, 1, 2, 888730) You will be glad to learn that today I weighed 106 1/2 lb.
('55', 468, 1, 3, 888789) This is a good record.
('55', 468, 1, 4, 888812) So you see that there is not the slightest cause for worry even on account of the elbow.
('55', 468, 1, 5, 888901) Your saltless experiment is producing interesting results.
('55', 468, 1, 6, 888960) I should, however, wait before ascribing all the good results to the absence of salt.
('55', 468, 1, 7, 889046) I wrote to Verrier 1 last week care of Khambhatta.
('55', 468, 1, 8, 889097) I hope he got my letter.
('55', 468, 1, 9, 889122) Yes, it is a good idea, his going to England for recuperation.
('55', 468, 1, 10, 889185) The sooner he goes the better.
('55', 468, 1, 11, 889216) It was very wrong of Shamrao to have had that fever.
('55', 468, 1, 12, 889269) Have you seen him?
('55', 468, 1, 13, 889288) I am sorry about Damodardas.
('55', 468, 1, 14, 889317) The enclosed is for him..
('55', 468, 1, 15, 889343) It is a superstition to think that saltless is tasteless.
('55', 468, 1, 16, 889401) Salt kills flavour.
('55', 468, 1, 17, 889421) I have known pepole not touch things with salt in them.
('55', 468, 1, 18, 889477) Taste is a matter of habit.
('55', 468, 1, 19, 889505) I suppose you do take butter and bread.
('55', 468, 1, 20, 889545) These do contain salt.
('55', 468, 1, 21, 889568) Your experiment is one of reducing the quantity of free salt.
('55', 468, 1, 22, 889630) The effect produced on you, therefore, is due to reduction, not entire absence of salt in your food.
('55', 468, 1, 23, 889731) But that does not matter.
('55', 468, 1, 24, 889757) Nor needyou worry that you are taking some salt somehow.
('55', 468, 1, 25, 889814) Let well alone.
('55', 468, 1, 26, 889830) Do you ever see Manilal?
('55', 468, 1, 27, 889855) Or is he still not there at all?
('55', 468, 1, 28, 889888) Love from us all.
('55', 468, 2, 29, 889906) BAPU [PS.] Verrier suggested that we should sing a Christian 2 hymn every Friday at evening prayer.
('55', 468, 2, 30, 890006) So Mahadev began Lead, Kindly Light in Gujarati 3. And this we shall continue every Friday.
('55', 468, 2, 31, 890098) Please tell Verrier this if he has not yet got my letter.

('55', 469, 2, 3, 890415) YERAVDA MANDIR 1, June 1, 1932
('55', 469, 3, 4, 890446) PARASRAM, 2
('55', 469, 4, 5, 890458) I was glad to hear that Nirmalas enthusiasm for Hindi was increasing.
('55', 469, 4, 6, 890528) By all means teach Hindi poems.
('55', 469, 4, 7, 890560) I do not know whether the lines on the palms (of our hands) have any significance, but there is no profit in trying to know what the future holds whether through these or through astrology or by any other means; on the contrary, it is definitely harmful.
('55', 469, 4, 8, 890815) And, one who is a lover of the Gita, i.e., who leaves the results of ones work to God, should never desire to know the future.
('55', 469, 4, 9, 890942) I have not received the booklet, but will go through it when I get it.
('55', 469, 4, 10, 891013) Destruction of small creatures as a result of essential activities is unavoidable.
('55', 469, 4, 11, 891096) As far as possible, we should be careful about those which we can see with our naked eyes; more than this, we cannot do.
('55', 469, 4, 12, 891217) Tiny insects like ants are not crushed under our feet when we walk.
('55', 469, 4, 13, 891285) They are protected by their very smallness.
('55', 469, 4, 14, 891329) But larger insects may be so crushed.
('55', 469, 4, 15, 891367) Hence it has been regarded as our duty to look at the ground in front of us while walking.
('55', 469, 4, 16, 891458) All these precautions are signs of our kind heartedness, but non violence is something more far reaching and wonderful.
('55', 469, 4, 17, 891578) It should be apparent in all our work, in our relationship with one another and in all our dealings with our fellowmen.
('55', 469, 4, 18, 891698) We should remain unconcerned when we see a peacock devouring a snake.
('55', 469, 4, 19, 891768) The latter is food for the former and we cannot interfere with it.
('55', 469, 4, 20, 891835) Tulsidass quatrain 3 about women which you have quoted is not only not applicable to all women but it is not even a criticism of women.
('55', 469, 4, 21, 891971) It criticizes mans sensuality.
('55', 469, 4, 22, 892002) Tulsidasjis point in it is that man, being lustful, thinks only of women, and he has written these lines to show what man becomes like when he is seized by lust.

('55', 470, 3, 5, 892781) The conclusion which you have drawn from my letter is correct.
('55', 470, 3, 6, 892844) If, instead of attempting a big leap, we take small steps according to our capacity, our enthusiasm for the work will increase and with that our self confidence.
('55', 470, 3, 7, 893006) I am not worried about Jamnalaljis loss of weight, as he otherwise keeps good health.
('55', 470, 3, 8, 893092) And, as for Vinoba, let him refrain from milk and ghee so long as he can maintain his health and strength.

('55', 471, 3, 6, 894072) But since I did not come across you anywhere I concluded that you might have been out of Bombay.
('55', 471, 3, 7, 894169) I hope you are keeping good health.
('55', 471, 3, 8, 894205) Seeing me will, I think, not be easy.

('55', 472, 9, 13, 895764) NARANDAS, I have practically decided that tomorrow, Wednesday, will be the last day when I will see visitors.
('55', 472, 9, 14, 895874) If the Government continue to delay its reply in regard to Mirabehn, I think I should assume that it will be negative and should stop seeing visitors for the time being.
('55', 472, 9, 15, 896044) I can start seeing them again if finaly the decision is favourable.
('55', 472, 9, 16, 896112) If Harilal wants to vent his anger on Bali 2, let him do so.
('55', 472, 9, 17, 896173) Bali is strong enough to face it, and knows how to deal with him.
('55', 472, 9, 18, 896239) Whether or not that is so, if the path of duty is clear before us we must follow it without regard to consequences.
('55', 472, 9, 19, 896355) Is it not because people are concerned about consequences that they often forsake the path of dharma?
('55', 472, 9, 20, 896457) The Gita was composed to drive this one lesson home, and it repeats the idea again and again in every possible context.
('55', 472, 9, 21, 896577) As we gradually understand more clearly the aim behind the five minutes silence (at prayer time), we shall feel its grandeur with greater and greater force.
('55', 472, 9, 22, 896734) Vasumati Thakore is being properly looked after.
('55', 472, 9, 23, 896783) The doctor said that she must have suffered from the disease for a long time.

('55', 473, 1, 2, 897008) If a labourer willingly agrees to obey the Ashram rules, do not discharge him even if there is no work for him.
('55', 473, 1, 3, 897120) If he himself wishes to leave, that would of course be another matter.
('55', 473, 1, 4, 897191) We should not discharge any person, who is otherwise good, merely for the sake of economy.
('55', 473, 1, 5, 897282) A labourer will never be a burden on us.
('55', 473, 1, 6, 897323) And the Ashram may engage paid labourers, but we shall be worthy of its great ideals only if we continue to work with our own hands or join them in work.
('55', 473, 1, 7, 897477) Dont let Dhiru and Kusum return for some time yet.
('55', 473, 1, 8, 897528) It will be a great error to suppose that, after their health has improved a little, they will be all right in the Ashram, They should return only after their health has become quite strong.
('55', 473, 1, 9, 897718) If they observe the Ashram ruleswhere they are staying and do whatever work their health permits, that would be as good as living in the Ashram.
('55', 473, 1, 10, 897863) Do not waste your time and energy in inquiring about Bas letters.
('55', 473, 1, 11, 897929) I got one postcard written by her.
('55', 473, 1, 12, 897964) How many Chharas 1 are there and where do they live?
('55', 473, 1, 13, 898017) From what part of the country do they come?
('55', 473, 1, 14, 898061) What is their language?
('55', 473, 1, 15, 898085) We should think what our duty towards them is, irrespective of whether or not they harass us.
('55', 473, 1, 16, 898179) See if anything is possible in this matter.
('55', 473, 1, 17, 898223) I have nothing more to say about the Magan spinning wheel.
('55', 473, 1, 18, 898282) My hand seems to be fairly well set on it.
('55', 473, 1, 19, 898325) I could also guess today from which part the sound comes.
('55', 473, 1, 20, 898383) I am using just now the slivers sent by Chhakkaddas.
('55', 473, 1, 21, 898436) I am naturally tempted to spin yarn of fine count from such good slivers.
('55', 473, 1, 22, 898510) Today I drew 22 rounds from one sliver.
('55', 473, 1, 23, 898550) Each sliver weighs less than one anna.
('55', 473, 1, 24, 898589) The count of the yarn, I guess, must be about 30. I spun today yarn of that count at the rate of 110 rounds per hour.
('55', 473, 1, 25, 898707) For yarn less fine than that I have already reached the speed of 130. I have preserved Totaramjis 2 letter.
('55', 473, 1, 26, 898815) I even made two copies.
('55', 473, 1, 27, 898839) One I sent to Gangabehn and the other to Chhaganlal Joshi.
('55', 473, 1, 28, 898898) If Totaramji has not kept a copy, I may return the original or send a copy from here.
('55', 473, 1, 29, 898984) Because of the uncertainly in regard to visitors, I have not asked for permission for Chitalia and others.
('55', 473, 1, 30, 899091) As for Thakkar Bapa, I am afraid I wont be able to write about him from here in any case.
('55', 473, 1, 31, 899181) It is enough that Bhansali at least sends news about him from time to time.

('55', 474, 1, 2, 899482) how the change in the spindle bearer in the Gandiva spinning wheel immediately resulted in improvement in count and speed, for he has acknowledged it.
('55', 474, 1, 3, 899633) I, therefore, think that there has been some misunderstanding.
('55', 474, 1, 4, 899696) I got a letter from Krishna, but she does not mention anything in it about Choudhariji, nor have I received a letter from him.
('55', 474, 1, 5, 899823) Which Choudhariji did you refer to?
('55', 474, 1, 6, 899859) Ba seems to have lost much weight but I hope that she and Navin are improving now.
('55', 474, 1, 7, 899942) If you interpreted Mirabehns letter to refer to fasting, you were not correct.
('55', 474, 1, 8, 900021) She spoke about the mockery of fasting, about eating only one meal on the 6th and 13th of the National Week 1. The Narayanappa affair is a shameful one.
('55', 474, 1, 9, 900174) Now that the guilty party in this theft has been found out, I suppose we must believe that Bhagwanjis suspicion, too, was correct.
('55', 474, 1, 10, 900305) If, however, Narayanappa is sincerely repentant and if all of you think that he may be permitted to stay on, by all means let him do so.
('55', 474, 1, 11, 900442) The spinning yajna will be complete if everybody hands over the yarn which he or she spun for that yajna.
('55', 474, 1, 12, 900548) There can be no doubt at all that such yajna will remain incomplete so long as those who take part in it wish to keep back the yarn for their own use.
('55', 474, 1, 13, 900699) The rule which I have suggested is that everybody should hand over all the yarn spun by himself to the Ashram, and he may get from the Ashram the khadi required for clothes.
('55', 474, 1, 14, 900873) One should spin yarn of the highest count that one can, and accept from the Ashram as coarse a cloth as ones body can tolerate or as many fall to ones share.
('55', 474, 1, 15, 901031) All this is implied in the vow on non possession and in the ideal of self dedication.
('55', 474, 1, 16, 901117) However, I do not have the courage to make this a compulsory rule for all.Moreover I am no more in your midst and, therefore, since the matter has come up for discussion, I am merely pointing out what the Ashram dharma demands.
('55', 474, 1, 17, 901345) Read this out to all and explain what I have said, and then leave it to every individual person to accept from it as much as he or she can.
('55', 474, 1, 18, 901485) But we can certainly make this rule, that everyone should wind yarn into neat hanks at the end of each day or week and hand them over with details of name, place, number of rounds, etc., and, when one wants to get cloth woven from the yarn, one may ask for the hanks according to the rule which one may have accepted for oneself.
('55', 474, 1, 19, 901815) I think this is absolutely essential for a correct record to be preserved.

('55', 475, 1, 3, 902116) Mahadevs yarn of 40 counts is piling up for he spins 630 rounds daily.
('55', 475, 1, 4, 902187) You should get ready rach 1 and fani 2 of the type necessary for weaving this yarn.
('55', 475, 1, 5, 902271) We should be able to weave yarn of 40 counts without the least difficulty.
('55', 475, 1, 6, 902346) I am of the view that we should build a regular tomb over Imam Sahebs 3 grave.
('55', 475, 1, 7, 902425) But you should consult a trustworthy Muslim and find out what the proper thing would be.
('55', 475, 1, 8, 902514) Maulvi Saheb Gulam Nadvi 4, who was a teacher in the Vidyapith for some time and had good relations with Imam Saheb and who was present at the funeral, will most probably be in Ahmedabad just now.
('55', 475, 1, 9, 902711) You may consult him.
('55', 475, 1, 10, 902732) There is no hurry, of course.
('55', 475, 1, 11, 902762) If Pyare Ali 5 himself has made any suggestion in this regard, let me know it.
('55', 475, 1, 12, 902841) All the persons whose names you sent to me came and saw me.
('55', 475, 1, 13, 902901) Anandlals Ranchhod also had joined the party, so they were six in all.

('55', 477, 1, 2, 905160) Recently I have been spinning on the Magan spinning wheel.
('55', 477, 1, 3, 905219) The left elbow is paining and the doctors say all it needs is rest.
('55', 477, 1, 4, 905287) Since the pain has been caused by the exertion of drawing the thread in spinning for many years, I learnt to draw the thread with the right hand on the Gandiva spinning wheel.
('55', 477, 1, 5, 905463) But the doctors advised me not to exert the left hand even for rotating the wheel.
('55', 477, 1, 6, 905546) Even otherwise, I had intended to learn spinning on the Magan spinning wheel, and this advice gave me one more reason for taking it up.
('55', 477, 1, 7, 905682) And so I have started spinning on it.
('55', 477, 1, 8, 905720) I had a good deal of difficulty in learining to use it, but I may say that I have now acquired fairly good control over it.
('55', 477, 1, 9, 905844) When I had good slivers, I had attained a speed of 150 rounds [per hour].
('55', 477, 1, 10, 905918) Just now I have been spinning with the worst possible kind of slivers.
('55', 477, 1, 11, 905989) Thespeed is less but not much less than 100. I give some time to Urdu.
('55', 477, 1, 12, 906060) And daily I read some book or other apart from star gazing.
('55', 477, 1, 13, 906120) I have taken up the study in right earnest.
('55', 477, 1, 14, 906164) I would not now show myself a complete ignoramus in discussing the subject with you.
('55', 477, 1, 15, 906249) Among the books which I have seen, I have found Flammarions book the most useful so far.
('55', 477, 1, 16, 906338) Dikshits book 1 seems to be the result of considerable labour, but, from a learners point of view, it requires a good deal of improvement.
('55', 477, 1, 17, 906477) Patwas Akashdarshan can be of some help, but the book is very superficial.
('55', 477, 1, 18, 906552) There ought to be one good book in Gujarati, which should also give some information relating to astronomy.
('55', 477, 1, 19, 906660) Two separate books in Gujarati for this purpose are not a practical proposition.
('55', 477, 1, 20, 906741) We must have a book which would give both scientific knowledge of astronomy and practical guidance.
('55', 477, 1, 21, 906841) If you were with me here, I would have made you write such a book and I also would have made some contribution to it.
('55', 477, 1, 22, 906959) I have come to take so much interest in the subject and perceived such deep religious significance in this study that, were not my knowledge altogether inadequate, I myself would have started writing such a book.
('55', 477, 1, 23, 907172) I occasionally exchange letters with Hiralal on this subject.
('55', 477, 1, 24, 907234) He has sent me two or three books.
('55', 477, 1, 25, 907269) I read the biographies of Ramakrishna and Vivekananda written by Romain Rolland.
('55', 477, 1, 26, 907350) One of them is being read by Mahadev now and the other by Sardar.
('55', 477, 1, 27, 907416) (Sardars self chosen job is to go through newspapers and to make beautiful envelopes from used brown paper or such other thick paper which we may get.
('55', 477, 1, 28, 907567) Thus he is daily adding to the nations wealth and dust is being turned into gold, so to say.)

('55', 478, 1, 2, 907762) Mahadev gives about five hours every day to carding and spinning.
('55', 478, 1, 3, 907828) There is a friend of Chimanlal named Chhakkaddas who loves spinning very much.
('55', 478, 1, 4, 907907) He has sent us beautiful slivers made from Cambodian and Navsari cotton.
('55', 478, 1, 5, 907980) With those slivers Mahadev daily spins 650 rounds, the yarn being of 40 to 45 counts, and also cards an equal quantity from the cotton which we have received.
('55', 478, 1, 6, 908139) Hence we always have a good stock of slivers with us.
('55', 478, 1, 7, 908193) My experiment of milkless diet continues.
('55', 478, 1, 8, 908235) My weight is steady.

('55', 480, 2, 14, 911418) Have you quoted that saying in reference to suicide from some book?
('55', 480, 2, 15, 911486) My opinion in this matter is as follows: A person suffering from an incurable disease has the right to commit suicide if he cannot perform any service whatsover and lives only as a result of the ministrations of others.
('55', 480, 2, 16, 911706) Fasting unto death is infinitely superior to drowning oneself.
('55', 480, 2, 17, 911769) A persons strength of character is tested in fasting moreover it leaves scope for changing ones mind, which is both proper and necessary.
('55', 480, 2, 18, 911907) But as long as he can perform the least bit of service, he is not justified in putting an end to his life.
('55', 480, 2, 19, 912014) Although physical activity is an important and necessary feature of yajna a physically disabled person can certainly perform mental yajna which is not totally unfruitful.
('55', 480, 2, 20, 912185) A man by his pure thoughts alone can render service.
('55', 480, 2, 21, 912238) He can also be engaged in giving useful advice and such like.
('55', 480, 2, 22, 912300) The thoughts of a man possessing a pure heart are an activity by themselves and can produce far reaching results.

('55', 481, 1, 3, 913030) At Sabarmati we have tried almost all improved ploughs manufactured in India and I think even others, but the claims made for each variety have not proved true in the long run.
('55', 481, 1, 4, 913207) An experienced man has said that the indigenous plough is specially designed for the Indian soil.
('55', 481, 1, 5, 913305) It conserves the soil, because it ploughs deep enough for the farmers crops but never deep enough to do damage.
('55', 481, 1, 6, 913417) Of course I do not claim to understand agriculture.
('55', 481, 1, 7, 913469) I am simply giving you the testimony of those who have had considerable experience in these matters.
('55', 481, 1, 8, 913570) What we have to remember is that all improved implements have to meet the peculiar conditions of India.
('55', 481, 1, 9, 913674) There is nothing wrong in an engine plough in itself and it may be a great advantage to a man who owns thousands of acres of land, and has a cracked caky soil, which will not yield under the indigenous plough.
('55', 481, 1, 10, 913884) What, however, we want is an implement that would suit owners of small holdings from one acre to three acres.
('55', 481, 1, 11, 913994) I do not believe in the doctrine of the greatest good of the greatest number.
('55', 481, 1, 12, 914072) It means in its nakedness that in order to achieve the supposed good of 51 per cent the interest of 49 per cent may be, or rather, should be sacrificed.
('55', 481, 1, 13, 914225) It is a heartless doctrine and has done harm to humanity.
('55', 481, 1, 14, 914283) The only real, dignified, human doctrine is the greatest good of all, and this can only be achieved by uttermost self sacrifice.

('55', 482, 1, 2, 914867) 555. CONCERNING TITIKSHA AND YAJNA 1
('55', 482, 2, 3, 914904) June 6, 1932 A friend 2 suffering from leprosy writes as follows: I am daily growing stronger in my faith that the best medicines for a person suffering from a disease like mine are asanas, pranayama and such other ordinary exercises and eating food earned through yajna.
('55', 482, 2, 4, 915176) I spend my time in reading the Gita, singing bhajans, meditation and spinning more than 500 rounds of yarn daily.
('55', 482, 2, 5, 915290) Our religion enjoins titiksha which means bearing all pains and miseries without opposing them even in thought, without worrying and without complaining.
('55', 482, 2, 6, 915444) I am trying to cultivate such endurance, and I am discovering from experience that it is difficult to acquire such strength unless one works regularly for yajna.
('55', 482, 2, 7, 915606) A person afflicted like me cannot do other forms of yajna, but, thanks be to God, I can do yajna by sweeping public roads, removing night soil and spinning, and I find my happiness in doing these things and try to bear my misfortune.
('55', 482, 2, 8, 915840) However, I often ask myself what my condition would be when the body became so weak that I could do no useful work.
('55', 482, 2, 9, 915956) The Shastras emphatically declare that a life without yajna is as good as death, that it is a burden and an affliction to the world.
('55', 482, 2, 10, 916089) You have said this repeatedly in your speeches and writings and my experience, too, tells the same thing.
('55', 482, 2, 11, 916195) If that is so, the question arises: What is the duty of a person who is so seriously ill with a disease that he can do no useful work at all and must live on the service of others? I even read in a Shastra that a person who suffered from such an incurable disease should give up his life by drowning himself or by some similar means.
('55', 482, 2, 12, 916529) This is only a summary in my own language of a beautiful letter.
('55', 482, 2, 13, 916594) I wish to draw a lesson for ourselves from this letter, namely, that all of us should cultivate this friends capacity for endurance and, even when ill with a disease, should go on doing useful work as long as the body permits.
('55', 482, 2, 14, 916821) That one must cultivate endurance and must do yajnathese are age old ideals.
('55', 482, 2, 15, 916898) We hear about them constantly in the Ashram.
('55', 482, 2, 16, 916943) When, however, we read such things described by a person

('55', 483, 1, 2, 917222) who is relating his own experience, they seem something new and fresh and the description has great power in it.
('55', 483, 1, 3, 917335) We do not expect a person suffering from leprosy to be able to write in this manner or to feel thus.
('55', 483, 1, 4, 917436) In most cases such persons, if they write about themselves, tell us how they suffer and complain about their misfortune.
('55', 483, 1, 5, 917557) Here we find something different altogether, and hence I have summarized the letter for the inmates of the Ashram.
('55', 483, 1, 6, 917672) The question which is raised in it also deserves attention.
('55', 483, 1, 7, 917732) We understand by yajna physical work voluntarily done for the service of others.
('55', 483, 1, 8, 917813) But this need not be taken to mean that a person who is physically too weak to do such work performs no yajna.
('55', 483, 1, 9, 917924) Such a person can serve with his mental capacities in many ways, and his work would most certainly be yajna.
('55', 483, 1, 10, 918033) But we can conceive of a case in which the person does not have the necessary degree of purity or sufficient mental strength for such yajna, and yet he is extremely eager to do it, has lost the desire to live, dislikes having to be served by others and is convinced that his disease is incurable.
('55', 483, 1, 11, 918330) I think that, in such circumstances a person who has the necessary strength of mind may certainly give up his life, one may even say that it is his duty to do so.
('55', 483, 1, 12, 918493) But to tell anybody that it is his duty to give up his life will probably shock him.
('55', 483, 1, 13, 918578) It is not right for a healthy person to tell another who is suffering from a disease that it is his duty to give up his life.
('55', 483, 1, 14, 918704) Such a remark may even upset that person.
('55', 483, 1, 15, 918746) But I think that is not likely to happen in this case, and so I have cautiously stated what seemed right to me.
('55', 483, 1, 16, 918858) It is certainly desirable that we should cease to fear death and give up the intense clinging to life which impels us to try to save it by trying every possible remedy and at the cost of infinite trouble to people around us.
('55', 483, 1, 17, 919083) My attitude in what I have written is that, if a thoughtful person afflicted with an incurable disease regards it his duty to give up his life, we need not think that what he does is absolutely wrong.

('55', 484, 2, 3, 919400) June 7, 1932
('55', 484, 3, 4, 919413) BHAI GHANSHYAMDAS, I have your letter.
('55', 484, 3, 5, 919452) My health seems to be well enough.
('55', 484, 3, 6, 919487) The weight is satisfactory.
('55', 484, 3, 7, 919515) I weighed 106 1/2 lb.
('55', 484, 3, 8, 919537) Doctors tell me that I am suffering from tennis elbow as a result of spinning continuously for years; rest is the only cure for it.
('55', 484, 3, 9, 919669) So I have to give complete rest to my elbow for 3 4 weeks.
('55', 484, 3, 10, 919728) I started using the Magan spinning wheel for this reason.
('55', 484, 3, 11, 919786) Before that I was using my left hand for plying the wheel instead of holding the sliver.
('55', 484, 3, 12, 919875) The doctors were not satisfied with this but they agreed to my turning the wheel with the foot.
('55', 484, 3, 13, 919971) But now my elbow has been put in splints in order to prevent the least movement.
('55', 484, 3, 14, 920052) Let us see now if the doctors diagnosis is correct or otherwise.
('55', 484, 3, 15, 920117) You have no cause for worry, there being no pain except in moving the arm.
('55', 484, 3, 16, 920192) Do send me the khadi woven out of the yarn spun by your sister.
('55', 484, 3, 17, 920256) I overlooked writing on this matter as your letter was not in front of me.
('55', 484, 3, 18, 920331) I have decided to study economics as much as I can while I am still here.
('55', 484, 3, 19, 920405) I took up the study of other books in the expectation of a long stay here.
('55', 484, 3, 20, 920480) Anyway I shall start on economics very soon.
('55', 484, 3, 21, 920525) I follow what you say about running the mill all day and night.
('55', 484, 3, 22, 920589) So often have I had the idea of making a detailed observation of your mills but it came to nothing.
('55', 484, 3, 23, 920689) I wish to watch the condition of the labourers with my own eyes.
('55', 484, 3, 24, 920754) We are all doing well.

('55', 485, 2, 3, 920888) [June 8, 1932] 1
('55', 485, 3, 4, 920905) MIRA, Your letter came in today.
('55', 485, 3, 5, 920938) the left arm is in splints.
('55', 485, 3, 6, 920966) The passers by who do not know the cause must be pitying me.
('55', 485, 3, 7, 921027) If the packinig of the elbow does not improve it, I might have try milk.
('55', 485, 3, 8, 921100) If I do, I shall also try the saltless experiment.
('55', 485, 3, 9, 921151) But only when I learnt that there was no such thing as a thorough saltless experiment, I accepted the medical friends, advice and began taking salt.
('55', 485, 3, 10, 921300) Milk contains plenty of salt as does water.
('55', 485, 3, 11, 921344) And at a seaside place, you continually drink in salt.
('55', 485, 3, 12, 921399) And yet there is decidedly some advantage in not taking additional free salt as a condiment.
('55', 485, 3, 13, 921492) What we get in water, milk and air is perhaps quite enough for the system.
('55', 485, 3, 14, 921567) I have a prejudice in favour of saltless diet.
('55', 485, 3, 15, 921614) Only I do not want to abstain from it religiously, unless I feel the necessity.
('55', 485, 3, 16, 921694) Meanwhile your observations are accumulating.
('55', 485, 3, 17, 921740) They will be useful.
('55', 485, 3, 18, 921761) I do not quite understand the position about Verrier.
('55', 485, 3, 19, 921815) What does he propose to do now?
('55', 485, 3, 20, 921847) If the extension is only up to July, what is to happen thereafter?
('55', 485, 3, 21, 921914) I have never understood the passport intricacies.
('55', 485, 3, 22, 921964) If he cannot go to England, he must go to a hill station.
('55', 485, 3, 23, 922022) Almora may be a suitable place.
('55', 485, 3, 24, 922054) If he is and is to remain vegetarian, he must copy your diet as closely as possible.
('55', 485, 3, 25, 922139) Very little starch, no vegetable proteid in the shape of pulses, plenty of milk and fresh green vegetables.
('55', 485, 3, 26, 922247) No potatoes and such other starchy vegetables.
('55', 485, 3, 27, 922294) No condiments.
('55', 485, 3, 28, 922309) Has he had my letter?
('55', 485, 3, 29, 922331) What may be regarded as final answer has been received about you.
('55', 485, 3, 30, 922397) The Government say they are informed that you were directing the movement before imprisonment and therefore you could not see me.
('55', 485, 3, 31, 922527) I have combated that statement 2 and have said that you were under instructions not to take part in civil disobedience movement and that you were confining yourself to the khadi work and sending reports to friends!
('55', 485, 3, 32, 922742) If I have erred, please correct me and I shall have no

('55', 486, 1, 5, 923318) I stopped interviews last week in anticipation, i.e., I did not see Manibehn and Dahyabhai.
('55', 486, 1, 6, 923410) You should rejoice in this additional trial and be thankful that we can write to each other.
('55', 486, 1, 7, 923503) But we should rejoice even if that stops.
('55', 486, 1, 8, 923545) Nothing happens without divine permission.
('55', 486, 1, 9, 923588) And how can we grieve over what He permits?
('55', 486, 1, 10, 923632) You should correspond with Radha regularly.
('55', 486, 1, 11, 923676) I believe your reading of her.
('55', 486, 1, 12, 923707) I must not write about it.
('55', 486, 1, 13, 923734) It will upset her.
('55', 486, 1, 14, 923753) She may take things from you.
('55', 486, 1, 15, 923783) You should make time for writing to her.
('55', 486, 1, 16, 923824) I believe that her expenses are met from the Ashram and that she has not been now for some months a burden on Damodardas.
('55', 486, 1, 17, 923946) You will have another talk with Damodardas and leave his place, if it will at all ease his burden.

('55', 486, 4, 22, 924158) June 8, 1932 She 3 has aged considerablyin some respects perhaps more than I have.
('55', 486, 4, 23, 924241) Spiritually she has made wonderful progress.
('55', 486, 4, 24, 924286) It will take me many incarnations to become disillusioned with the slowness of the charkha.
('55', 486, 4, 25, 924378) The slowness of the charkha is perhaps its most appealing part for me.
('55', 486, 4, 26, 924449) But it has so many attractions for me that I can never get tired of it.
('55', 486, 4, 27, 924521) It has a perennial interest for me.
('55', 486, 4, 28, 924557) Its implications are growing on me and I make discoveries of its beauties almost from day to day.
('55', 486, 4, 29, 924655) I am not using a sewing machine in its place or at all.
('55', 486, 4, 30, 924711) I know how the mistake crept into the papers.
('55', 486, 4, 31, 924757) My right elbow, having been used for turning the wheel, almost without a break for over ten years, began to give pain, and the doctors here came to
('55', 486, 5, 32, 924905) 1 According to the addressee this was correct.
('55', 486, 5, 33, 924952) 2 Henry Solomon Leon Polak, a close associate of Gandhiji during the South African struggle.
('55', 486, 5, 34, 925045) He had written to Gandhiji: London papers report that you have taken up the sewing machine having been disillusioned with the slowness of char kha.
('55', 486, 5, 35, 925193) I dont believe it for a moment.

('55', 487, 1, 2, 925315) the conclusion that the pain was of the same type that tennis players often have after continuous use of the racquet.
('55', 487, 1, 3, 925433) They therefore advised complete rest for the elbow.
('55', 487, 1, 4, 925485) That might have meant cessation of spinning for some time, but for Prabhudass invention.
('55', 487, 1, 5, 925574) You know Prabhudas, Chhaganlals son.
('55', 487, 1, 6, 925611) His invention consists in turning the wheel with a pedal and thus freeing the right hand also for drawing the thread and practically doubling the output of yarn.
('55', 487, 1, 7, 925773) I forestalled the doctors by having this wheel brought to me, and before the peremptory order to stop all work with the right elbow came, I was master of the pedal charkha called Magan charkha after the late Maganlal.
('55', 487, 1, 8, 925991) A stupid reporter who knew nothing about the invention, when he heard that I was moving the wheel with the pedal, came to the conclusion that I was working at the sewing machine and since there are Pressmen good enough to imagine many things of me and impute all sorts of things to me, they improved upon the false report by deducing disillusionment about the charkha from it.

('55', 487, 4, 13, 926562) (2) There is no shame in losing money, but it is shameful, even sinful, to hide the fact of ones loss.
('55', 487, 4, 14, 926665) (3) One should never live beyond ones means.
('55', 487, 4, 15, 926710) Though one may be living in a bungalow today, one should be prepared to live in a hut tomorrow.
('55', 487, 4, 16, 926806) (4) We need not feel ashamed if we do not have enough money to pay our creditors.
('55', 487, 4, 17, 926888) (5) Anybody who hands over to his creditors everything without keeping back a single pie for himself has fully repaid his debt.
('55', 487, 4, 18, 927016) (6) Wisdom lies first in not starting a business with borrowed money, but in case one has already done it, the next wise thing is to give away what one has and free oneself from ones debts.

('55', 488, 3, 7, 927554) I do not know what the Government would call being actively engaged in the furtherance of the civil disobedience movement.
('55', 488, 3, 8, 927677) It is likely too that the Government are misinformed.
('55', 488, 3, 9, 927731) Obviously Mirabai has had no chance of refuting the information given to them.
('55', 488, 3, 10, 927810) I can only reiterate my statement that like several other companions of mine she has been intentionally, and for the movement itself, kept out of its civil resistance part.
('55', 488, 3, 11, 927983) But if Mirabai at any time was, or is now, actively engaged in the furtherance of the civil disobedience movement, my wife and my two sons were taking an active part in it.
('55', 488, 3, 12, 928156) Yet if they were not in prison, being members of my family, they would, I presume, be allowed to see me.
('55', 488, 3, 13, 928261) As I have made it clear to the Government in previous communications, I have long ceased to make any distinction between family members and others.
('55', 488, 3, 14, 928409) My co workers are as much members of my family as the members so called.
('55', 488, 3, 15, 928482) Unless therefore the Government see their way to revise their decision, I must deny myself the pleasure of having weekly visitors.
('55', 488, 3, 16, 928613) I enforced the self denying ordinance on Saturday last.
('55', 488, 3, 17, 928669) Indeed under the ruling given by the Government in Mirabais case it would be a serious thing for me to take the responsibility of deciding in the case of Ashram inmates who should and who should not see me.
('55', 488, 4, 18, 928876) Yours sincerely, M. K.GANDHI

('55', 489, 3, 4, 929182) BHAI NATHURAM, I felt happy on reading your detailed letter.
('55', 489, 3, 5, 929243) I am glad that you have gone there to learn khadi work.
('55', 489, 3, 6, 929299) Learn it well and properly.
('55', 489, 3, 7, 929327) If you get mere superficial knowledge, on your return you will not be able to teach it to others.
('55', 489, 3, 8, 929425) You will be able to do that only if you acquire mastery over the smallest details.
('55', 489, 3, 9, 929508) Observe the Ashram rules carefully.

('55', 489, 8, 13, 929636) BHAI RAMESHWARDAS, I got your letter.
('55', 489, 8, 14, 929674) I had also received your previous letters.
('55', 489, 8, 15, 929717) You must have received my replies.
('55', 489, 8, 16, 929752) Repeating Ramanama certainly does not mean repeating it mechanically with the lips.
('55', 489, 8, 17, 929836) The preceptor of Ramanama believes that if a person repeats it mechanically but with faith, his faith itself will some day carry the name below the throat and right down to the heart.
('55', 489, 8, 18, 930020) So long as this has not happened, one cannot have true peace.
('55', 489, 8, 19, 930082) I know of no other remedy which could give you peace.
('55', 489, 8, 20, 930136) You should cut down your intake of food as a medical necessity at least, and if even then you do not keep well you should try fasting, etc.
('55', 489, 8, 21, 930276) I wrote a postcard to Pyarelal only a few days ago.

('55', 490, 2, 3, 930465) June 9, 1932
('55', 490, 3, 4, 930478) PARASRAM, I got your two letters pinned together.
('55', 490, 3, 5, 930528) I find that the short letter with paragraph headings is a summary of the first one and that it would be enough to read that alone.
('55', 490, 3, 6, 930659) But it appears that you have also sent the original letter so that I may know more details if I wish.
('55', 490, 4, 7, 930761) You should certainly not strain your will to use the limb which pains, that is, use it disregarding the pain.
('55', 490, 4, 8, 930871) If you feel that because of such self restraint the pain is gradually decreasing, you may conclude nothing else is necessary.
('55', 490, 4, 9, 930997) If the pain does not decrease gradually even though you take care not to use that limb, there is no option but to take complete rest.
('55', 490, 5, 10, 931131) There can be no one rule for all as to the time required for a meal.
('55', 490, 5, 11, 931200) If somebodys meal consists only of milk, it would take him only five to seven minutes to sip it.
('55', 490, 5, 12, 931297) If somebody elses meal consists only of one pomegranate and he has no teeth but has to eat the seeds instead of extracting the juice and drinking it, he may even take an hour to do so.
('55', 490, 5, 13, 931482) Hence the following should be the rule: A meal should take up as much time as is required for chewing it properly, taking into consideration the type and quantity of the food.
('55', 490, 5, 14, 931658) Ordinarily, twenty to thirty minutes should be regarded enough for those who have good teeth and who eat rotlis 1, dal, rice and vegetables.
('55', 490, 5, 15, 931799) I have no faith in the common belief about sleeping with the head in a certain direction.
('55', 490, 5, 16, 931889) I have never followed that rule.
('55', 490, 6, 17, 931922) It is my belief that the peepul tree is considered sacred because it is very big, covers a large area with shade and can be grown almost everywhere.
('55', 490, 7, 18, 932071) I understand what you say about the Hindi translation of my letters, etc.
('55', 490, 7, 19, 932145) I shall be satisfied if everybody else is satisfied in this matter.
('55', 490, 8, 20, 932213) I used to keep cloves and sugar crystals in my mouth merely to prevent my voice getting hoarse.

('55', 491, 5, 5, 932599) June 9, 1932 As you say, you are continually assailed by impure thoughts and feel miserable because of that.
('55', 491, 5, 6, 932708) This is what is called self made hell.
('55', 491, 5, 7, 932747) This contains the replies to both your questions.
('55', 491, 5, 8, 932797) It makes clear why I said what I did and also why such a state of mind is described as hell.
('55', 491, 5, 9, 932890) If you understand the nature of this hell, it will also be easy for you to understand how you can come out of it.
('55', 491, 5, 10, 933004) You should not brood over the fact that you get impure thoughts.
('55', 491, 5, 11, 933069) Instead, you should go on as if they never troubled you.
('55', 491, 5, 12, 933126) If a person who stumbles while walking does not stop to find out the cause of his stumbling, no harm will follow.
('55', 491, 5, 13, 933240) If, on the contrary, such a person sits down on the road and goes on thinking why he stumbled, he will make no progress in his journey.
('55', 491, 5, 14, 933376) But he will forget that he had stumbled if he does not think much about the fact and continues his journey.
('55', 491, 5, 15, 933484) Since he is advancing, he gradually gathers strength and consequently stumblesless.

('55', 491, 9, 19, 933648) June 10, 1932 Most of the manual work in the Ashram is done by the inmates themselves.
('55', 491, 9, 20, 933735) There are a few hired labourers, but only those men who follow the Ashram rules fairly well have remained to work in that capacity and the inmates of the Ashram work with them.
('55', 491, 9, 21, 933912) Gradually they are acquiring mastery over all types of work.
('55', 491, 9, 22, 933973) Children also contribute their share Newcomers are first required to learn prayers, bhajans, etc.
('55', 491, 9, 23, 934071) It is only after they have learnt these that those among them who wish to learn English may do so.
('55', 492, 0, 1, 934170) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 493
('55', 492, 1, 2, 934216) All the inmates spin for yajna in company for one hour.
('55', 492, 1, 3, 934272) Yarn of less than twenty counts cannot be included as part of ones contribution through the spinning yajna.
('55', 492, 1, 4, 934380) The yarn spun on a day has to be handed over to the depot on the same day.
('55', 492, 1, 5, 934455) I have now suggested that, if all the people agree, no one should be permitted to buy the yarn spun by himself or herself for his or her own use.
('55', 492, 1, 6, 934601) 1 I have always believed that our yajna remains incomplete because of this freedom to buy ones own yarn.
('55', 492, 1, 7, 934706) Beginning last week, it has been decided to maintain an account of everybodys labour at the rate of one anna per hour of work irrespective of the nature of work, though it has not been decided to make actual payments at this rate.
('55', 492, 1, 8, 934937) Just now my suggestion to Narandas was merely that, if he agreed, he should immediately start keeping the records.
('55', 492, 1, 9, 935052) These records will be in addition to the general records which are being kept now, and for the present we will merely note the results.
('55', 492, 1, 10, 935188) They will give us much useful information and may also help us to realize the ideal of equality of work.
('55', 492, 1, 11, 935293) In other words, all types of social service, whether spinning or weaving or cleaning lavatories, should be valued at the rate of one anna per hour of work.
('55', 492, 1, 12, 935449) You probably remember that we have discussed this subject in the past at great length.
('55', 492, 1, 13, 935536) Recently I have been writing to Narandas on a variety of subjects and among them I brought up this one again for discussion.
('55', 492, 1, 14, 935661) It seems to me that Narandass capacity for responding to such idea has increased considerably these days.
('55', 492, 1, 15, 935767) He, therefore, welcomed my suggestion.
('55', 492, 1, 16, 935806) These records do not require much time to maintain and, if the present experiment reaches the stage of implementation, the keeping of accounts would be so easy that even a person of ordinary education in Gujarati would be able to do the work.
('55', 492, 1, 17, 936049) Success in maintaining accounts of this nature depends on the honesty of the people.
('55', 492, 1, 18, 936134) If a person has not really worked for the number of hours which he enters against his name or supplies to the account keeper, or if he has done the work carelessly, it is plain that the account will not be correct.
('55', 492, 1, 19, 936349) That is, it will be like good and bad coins getting mixed up.
('55', 492, 1, 20, 936411) I have been writing from here a great deal about childrens education too.
('55', 492, 1, 21, 936485) I cannot tell how much of it the inmates of the Ashram will be able to adopt.
('55', 492, 1, 22, 936563) It would require much time to discuss all that here, and I cannot spare it.
('55', 492, 1, 23, 936639) Have patience in this matter.

('55', 493, 1, 2, 936757) All of us should make the right use, according to our lights, of this priceless opportunity which we have got.
('55', 493, 1, 3, 936868) The best use we can make of it is to cultivate the power of reflection.
('55', 493, 1, 4, 936940) Our minds are oftenvacant and at such times the only thing we like to do is either to read or to talk.
('55', 493, 1, 5, 937043) Some of us do think, but they only build castles in the air.
('55', 493, 1, 6, 937104) Really speaking, just as reading is an art so is thinking.
('55', 493, 1, 7, 937163) All our thoughts should occur to us at the right time.
('55', 493, 1, 8, 937218) Just we do not read useless books, so also we should not let our minds run after idle thoughts.
('55', 493, 1, 9, 937314) The power which is produced and conserved by such control over ones thoughts can not be measured.
('55', 493, 1, 10, 937412) I have felt during each term of imprisonment that it was the best time for learning to think in this manner.
('55', 493, 1, 11, 937521) I, therefore, advise all of you to master the art of deep reflection.
('55', 493, 1, 12, 937591) If you do so, you will not find it necessary to consult me frequently.
('55', 493, 1, 13, 937662) But let no one misunderstand my meaning.
('55', 493, 1, 14, 937703) I do not wish to forbid anyone to consult me.
('55', 493, 1, 15, 937749) I only wish to cure people of excessive dependence on me.
('55', 493, 1, 16, 937807) In case of necessity, however, my advice will always be available.
('55', 493, 1, 17, 937874) It is your right and also your duty to take whatever advantage you can of my experience and the results of my reflection concerning matters of which I have had more experience and over which I have reflected more deeply than others.

('55', 493, 5, 25, 938397) One should not keep thinking about the past.
('55', 493, 5, 26, 938442) After drawing the proper lesson from it, one should forget it.

('55', 496, 2, 3, 941815) June 12, 1932
('55', 496, 3, 4, 941829) PREMA, I did not consider your letter too long, for you have given in it an account of your visits such as I had wanted you to give.
('55', 496, 3, 5, 941962) I have been to Sinhagarh thrice.
('55', 496, 3, 6, 941995) Once I went there while the Lokamanya was also there 1, and we met each other a good many times.
('55', 496, 3, 7, 942092) I saw his house.
('55', 496, 3, 8, 942109) You have certainly described a few things about which I did not know.
('55', 496, 3, 9, 942179) I did meet Hari Narayan Apte 2. I certainly with to read his novels,but I do not have the courage to take up anything new just now.
('55', 496, 3, 10, 942311) Urdu, economics, watching the sky, spinning and writing lettersthese keep me busy enough.
('55', 496, 3, 11, 942401) And off and on I take up something extra to read.
('55', 496, 3, 12, 942451) What you say about the Superintendent 3 is correct.
('55', 496, 3, 13, 942503) I saw and understood everything.
('55', 496, 3, 14, 942536) But we should tolerate all that.
('55', 496, 3, 15, 942569) As a man he is certainly not bad.
('55', 496, 3, 16, 942603) But authority is an evil thing.
('55', 496, 3, 17, 942635) And, besides, authority over whom?
('55', 496, 3, 18, 942670) We should , therefore, reason thus: How good is it that even in unfavourable circumstances a little measure of hum anity has survived?
('55', 496, 3, 19, 942805) Who knows to what depths we would have descended if we were in his place?
('55', 496, 3, 20, 942879) You will frequently get the kind of experiences you had.
('55', 496, 3, 21, 942936) It is through such experiences that we learn to cultivate forbearance, generosity, patience and courtesy.
('55', 496, 3, 22, 943042) In favourable circumstances, everyone can behave in a manner which will win him or her the good opinion of others.
('55', 496, 3, 23, 943157) There was no special meaning behind my question.
('55', 496, 3, 24, 943206) Are you satisfied now? I asked the question only casually.
('55', 496, 3, 25, 943265) Sushila may not have felt hurt, but I myself felt sorry.
('55', 496, 3, 26, 943322) Having permitted her to come with you, I should have talked with her a little.
('55', 496, 3, 27, 943401) But I had no time and so contented myself with an inquiry about Jamnadas.
('55', 496, 3, 28, 943475) My blessings to her.
('55', 496, 3, 29, 943496) I certainly intended to write on the subject of sex.
('55', 496, 3, 30, 943549) But it would be better if you ask me specific questions.
('55', 496, 3, 31, 943606) We need not stop the teaching of English.
('55', 496, 3, 32, 943648) All that I meant was that we should not teach it to new pupils before they have learnt the other things.
('55', 496, 3, 33, 943753) I have written more about this in my letter to Narandas.

('55', 497, 4, 7, 944313) 571. LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI
('55', 497, 5, 8, 944344) June 8/13, 1932
('55', 497, 6, 9, 944360) NARANDAS, I had got your postcard before I received the other post from you today, but I did not reply to it in a separate letter since I had written in detail about Narayanappa in the letter which was dispatched yesterday along with the other letters.
('55', 497, 6, 10, 944613) I have now received a negative reply in regard to Mirabehn.
('55', 497, 6, 11, 944673) It was good, therefore, that I had already decided provisionally not to see visitors.
('55', 497, 6, 12, 944759) That being so, though Durga and Anandi 2 had come today to see us, Vallabhbhai and I could not see them.
('55', 497, 6, 13, 944864) Mahadev went and saw them.
('55', 497, 6, 14, 944891) We certainly felt unhappy but it is only by swallowing such bitter draughts that one can preserve dharma.
('55', 497, 6, 15, 944997) I, therefore, welcomed the pain that I felt.
('55', 497, 6, 16, 945042) I am very happy that you have decided to follow the method of calculating the value of work at the rate of one anna per hour.
('55', 497, 6, 17, 945168) I think we shall make some important discoveries by following it.
('55', 497, 6, 18, 945234) In order that the account may be properly kept, everybody should know exactly how long one has worked.
('55', 497, 6, 19, 945337) That means that you will have to strike the bell for each hour or will have to devise some other method so that everybody can know how much time has passed.
('55', 497, 6, 20, 945494) Secondly, the information about the hours of work supplied by every inmate must be correct.
('55', 497, 6, 21, 945586) If it is clearly realized that time is money, it will be seen that giving wrong information will be like passing off counterfeit coins.
('55', 497, 6, 22, 945722) Our records will be wrong and, in consequence, our conclusions will be wrong too.
('55', 497, 6, 23, 945804) I think for at least one month the slips received from everybody should be preserved.
('55', 497, 6, 24, 945890) To facilitate this, I suppose all the inmates are supplied slips of the same size.
('55', 497, 6, 25, 945973) The slips should be

('55', 498, 0, 1, 946140) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 499
('55', 498, 1, 2, 946186) filled in clear handwriting.
('55', 498, 1, 3, 946215) Now that I think about the matter as I dictate these lines, I feel that you yourself need not keep a daily record.
('55', 498, 1, 4, 946330) Your record will be the slips.
('55', 498, 1, 5, 946361) If we decide to preserve them permanently, they can be pasted [in an account book] but I do not think that is necessary at all.
('55', 498, 1, 6, 946489) As the slips are received, the hours mentioned in them may be entered in the ledger.
('55', 498, 1, 7, 946574) If you object that, in that case, we would not know for how many hours each type of work was done, you may enter the hours under separate heads of work.
('55', 498, 1, 8, 946727) However, to be able to use that information you will have to maintain a double entry account, that is, keep the record under each name and each type of work separately.
('55', 498, 1, 9, 946896) Only then will you be able to draw up quickly a summary every month showing the hours given by each person and the total number of hours spent on each type of work.
('55', 498, 1, 10, 947061) I do think that for our purpose information under both heads will be necessary.
('55', 498, 1, 11, 947141) At the moment I cannot think of any other suggestions besides these.
('55', 498, 1, 12, 947210) Your account of your own daily work seems all right.
('55', 498, 1, 13, 947263) If necessary, you may reduce yajna work from two hours to something less.
('55', 498, 1, 14, 947337) If anybody gives money equal to the value of the yarn spun by him, instead of the yarn itself, his yajna is certainly imperfect, since it is marred by his desire to wear cloth woven from his own yarn.
('55', 498, 1, 15, 947538) That is, he spins yarn of the fine count through his selfish desire to be able to wear cloth woven from such yarn.
('55', 498, 1, 16, 947653) Ideally,one should not wish to all to derive any personal benefit from work done for yajna or from any gift made as yajna.
('55', 498, 1, 17, 947776) Anybody who works for yajna may take from what he produces only as much as would be the share of each if the total quantity were divided equally among all the persons for whom he works.
('55', 498, 1, 18, 947962) We claim that we work for the 300 millions of our countrymen.
('55', 498, 1, 19, 948024) If so, we may certainly have 1/300 millionth share of the yarn which we spin, imagining that that share is mixed with the yarn from which the cloth of our garments is woven.
('55', 498, 1, 20, 948198) I know that many arguments have been advanced, from the point of view of increasing the production of fine khadi, against my stand, and I admit the force of those arguments.
('55', 498, 1, 21, 948372) That is why I have tolerated yajna which is only half pure.
('55', 498, 1, 22, 948432) But I have always felt within myself that such yajna is imperfect.
('55', 498, 1, 23, 948499) If you clearly see the imperfection to which I am drawing attention, you should hand over all the yarn which you spin and overcome your desire to get cloth woven from it for your or Jamnas use.
('55', 498, 1, 24, 948693) When all the yarn received is mixed together and woven into cloth, you may take from it what you require.
('55', 498, 1, 25, 948799) If you see any error in my reasoning, please point it out to me.
('55', 498, 1, 26, 948864) And you need not follow my
('55', 499, 0, 1, 948891) 500 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 499, 1, 2, 948933) suggestion though you may agree with me, if you feel that it is beyond your capacity at present to do soirrespective of whether the reason is Jamna or yourself.
('55', 499, 1, 3, 949094) If we voluntarily start doing something which we had not been doing up to now, we experience nothing but intense joy from that and feel that a heavy load has been taken off our head.
('55', 499, 1, 4, 949277) Do not act upon my suggestion till you feel thus.
('55', 499, 1, 5, 949327) As I stated ina previous letter, I want everybodys yajna to be perfect, but I should like to wait till all people are convinced of the correctness of my view.
('55', 499, 1, 6, 949486) I see from your letter, however, that they have now come so far that it should not be difficult to take that last step, if it is not implied in what they have agreed to.
('55', 499, 1, 7, 949656) I have interpreted your letter to mean that everybody would spin for yajna in the porch between 12.30 and 1.30 and hand over there and then the yarn spun by him or her.
('55', 499, 1, 8, 949825) Literally understood, this means that one cannot even buy back that yarn.
('55', 499, 1, 9, 949899) If this is to apply to all, you also will have to hand over the yarn spun by you.
('55', 499, 1, 10, 949981) Your statement, however, that the yarn spun during that time will be handed over may also mean that a person may buy back his or her yarn for personal use.
('55', 499, 1, 11, 950137) If so, the arrangement will have the imperfection which I have remarked above.
('55', 499, 1, 12, 950216) I should be happy if all agree to remove this imperfection.
('55', 499, 1, 13, 950276) If they agree, however, everybody should understand that he will have to spin in future even more carefully than he had been doing up to now when he knew that he was spinning the yarn for his own use.
('55', 499, 1, 14, 950477) I have been spinning for the last ten days or so with such bad slivers as I have never used before.
('55', 499, 1, 15, 950577) I am doing this purposely.
('55', 499, 1, 16, 950604) I wrote to Premlilabehn requesting her to send me some cotton, and in reply she immediately sent slivers.
('55', 499, 1, 17, 950710) The slivers with which I have been spinning are from this lot.
('55', 499, 1, 18, 950773) It certainly cannot be thrown away as useless.
('55', 499, 1, 19, 950820) That would mean being light hearted about work, Nor can I send these silvers to the women prisoners.
('55', 499, 1, 20, 950921) If the slivers are good enough for them I would say that they were twice for me.
('55', 499, 1, 21, 951002) I, therefore, decided to use them up.
('55', 499, 1, 22, 951040) I realize from my experience the great difference between good slivers and bad slivers.
('55', 499, 1, 23, 951128) Theoretically I always understood it, but I realized it from experience only now, for ordinarily I would always get good slivers.
('55', 499, 1, 24, 951258) Whenever I myself have carded cotton I have done so very carefully.
('55', 499, 1, 25, 951326) Hence I do not remember to have spun with such bad slivers any time in the past.
('55', 499, 1, 26, 951407) And I see from Mahadevs spinning what difference good cotton can make.
('55', 499, 1, 27, 951478) My purpose in writing about all this is to point out that, if we
('55', 500, 0, 1, 951543) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 501
('55', 500, 1, 2, 951589) wish to spin for yajna the finest yarn that we can, the slivers with which we spin should be of the best quality and the cotton must be perfectly clean.
('55', 500, 1, 3, 951742) The spinning wheel also should be in good condition.
('55', 500, 1, 4, 951795) If these conditions are fulfilled, no one will find the one hour of spinning boring.
('55', 500, 1, 5, 951880) On the contrary, the smoothly rotating spinning wheels would make such sweet music when so many persons spin in complete silence that the hour would pass as but one minute and give perfect joy.
('55', 500, 1, 6, 952074) Even the most interesting activities will only bore a personwho does not understand their value or who feel aversion towards them.
('55', 500, 1, 7, 952205) Here ends my sermon on account books and on yajna.
('55', 500, 1, 8, 952256) I have already said above that I will not see visitors now.
('55', 500, 1, 9, 952316) Do not worry about my hand till I tell you that the condition is serious enough to cause worry, for I am keeping back nothing about it.
('55', 500, 1, 10, 952452) I see no necessity to keep back anything.
('55', 500, 1, 11, 952494) We aspire to learn to bear everything that may happen to us.
('55', 500, 1, 12, 952555) If so, it would be altogether wrong to keep back anything relating to illness or pain.
('55', 500, 1, 13, 952642) The left elbow is in plaster just now.
('55', 500, 1, 14, 952681) I, therefore, present a pitiful sight, though there is no reason at all to pity me.
('55', 500, 1, 15, 952765) If the cause of the pain in the elbow is no other than the excessive work I have done with that arm, it is obvious that it should be given complete rest.
('55', 500, 1, 16, 952919) Since the only way of doing that is to put it in plaster, that has been done.
('55', 500, 1, 17, 952997) We shall know the effect in a week or two.
('55', 500, 1, 18, 953040) If the elbow requires only rest, the officials themselves will obtain whatever external aid may be required.
('55', 500, 1, 19, 953149) In other respects my health is very good.
('55', 500, 1, 20, 953191) The weight is 106 1/2 pounds, that is, it has been increasing.
('55', 500, 1, 21, 953254) Though I can work only with one arm, and despite the trouble which bad slivers give, I can spin more than 200 rounds daily.
('55', 500, 1, 22, 953378) I can also read for a while.
('55', 500, 1, 23, 953407) I practise, like a child, writing large Urdu letters in a copy book.
('55', 500, 1, 24, 953476) I would not be able to do all this if my health was not good.
('55', 500, 1, 25, 953538) The mind would simply not work.
('55', 500, 1, 26, 953570) I think your decision regarding Jayantiprasads daughter is perfectly all right.
('55', 500, 1, 27, 953650) You should not assume new responsibilities just now.
('55', 500, 1, 28, 953703) If the girl were capable of looking after herself and were healthy, I would have certainly felt tempted to take her in.
('55', 500, 1, 29, 953823) Chimanalal 1 should improve his health anyhow.
('55', 500, 1, 30, 953870) Leave Parnerkar 2 to solve his problem by himself.
('55', 500, 1, 31, 953921) If he can stay, we certainly want him to do so.
('55', 500, 1, 32, 953969) If he cannot, we need not press him.
('55', 500, 1, 33, 954006) The verse in the Gita which asks what avails a man to force himself
('55', 500, 2, 34, 954074) 1 One of the oldest inmates of the Ashram, a patient of asthma 2 Yashwant Mahadev Parnerkar, Specialist in animal husbandry
('55', 501, 0, 1, 954198) 502 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('55', 501, 1, 2, 954240) beyond a certain point applies in this case too.
('55', 501, 1, 3, 954289) The fact that you do not find Savitribehns address there means, I suppose, that you have not been getting any letters from her recently.
('55', 501, 1, 4, 954426) But her connection with the Ashram is not recent.
('55', 501, 1, 5, 954476) You may find some of her old letters lying somewhere.
('55', 501, 1, 6, 954530) Moreover, if corresp ondents addresses are being preserved in the Ashram, her address must have been written down somewhere.
('55', 501, 1, 7, 954655) If anybody goes to thepress, we are bound to have her address on its record.
('55', 501, 1, 8, 954732) She has also written a book about me, in which she has reproduced some of my letters.
('55', 501, 1, 9, 954818) You may possibly find her address in these.
('55', 501, 1, 10, 954862) However, I do not want you to spend too much of your time in finding it.
('55', 501, 1, 11, 954935) Father Elwin has not explained why he suggested Friday for a Christian prayer.
('55', 501, 1, 12, 955014) On Sunday evenings pious Christians will have gone to churches and will be attending special services, so that Sunday may not suit them for the purpose of the public communion which he has in view.
('55', 501, 1, 13, 955212) Moreover, Friday is the day of Jesuss crucifixion, and Father Elwin may have selected it for that reason.
('55', 501, 1, 14, 955318) But this is only my guess.
('55', 501, 1, 15, 955345) I very much like the idea that we should fix one day in the week for a Muslim prayer.
('55', 501, 1, 16, 955431) If Friday is not available now for that purpose, we may fix Thursday.
('55', 501, 1, 17, 955501) Thursday means Jummerat, and I think that day also is holy for Muslims.
('55', 501, 1, 18, 955573) To us, however, all days and hours are equally holy.
('55', 501, 1, 19, 955626) It is enough if we pray with sincere devotion.
('55', 501, 1, 20, 955673) We also had read here in the papers about the suitcase.
('55', 501, 1, 21, 955729) Hence Mahadev believes that we must have lost one.
('55', 501, 1, 22, 955780) Aluvihari was with us all the time and was one of the party.
('55', 501, 1, 23, 955841) It seems that, having read about the suitcase in the papers, he went and claimed it.
('55', 501, 1, 24, 955926) Mahadev cannot guess and if he cannot, how can I?whose clothes and books it contains.
('55', 501, 1, 25, 956012) Well, it is safe now.
('55', 501, 1, 26, 956034) Aluvihari will probably send it to you, or may use his judgement and do with it what seems best to him.
('55', 501, 1, 27, 956138) I expect to hear from him.
('55', 501, 1, 28, 956165) I have always considered that the rule that newcomers should not be permitted to start immediately on English is a correct one.
('55', 501, 1, 29, 956293) My stand is that they may learn English, must learn it, but only after they have acquired a working knowledge of Sanskrit, Hindi and the Urdu script, learnt music well enough to join in singing bhajans and mastered all the processes relating to spinning.
('55', 501, 1, 30, 956548) I think a person of average ability would take one year to complete this programme, though it is likely that some may take more than that and some less.
('55', 501, 1, 31, 956701) Those who have joined the Ashram for life or have joined it
('55', 502, 0, 1, 956761) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 503
('55', 502, 1, 2, 956807) temporarily with the aim of training themselves for service should have no special attraction for English.
('55', 502, 1, 3, 956914) If anybody feels it, he should know that he cannot satisfy his desire in the Ashram.
('55', 502, 1, 4, 956999) Nobody should understand from this that we proscribe English from the Ashram or do not love it as much as others do.
('55', 502, 1, 5, 957116) Our only aim is to see that it does not occupy a place which does not belong to it.
('55', 502, 1, 6, 957200) For many persons knowledge of English is essential even for the purpose of service, butwe can give instruction in it in the Ashram only in a manner convenient to the Ashram and consistent with its aims.
('55', 502, 1, 7, 957403) We are entitled to expect this patience in all inmates of the Ashram.
('55', 502, 1, 8, 957473) June 11, 1932 Regarding Imam Sahebs tomb, Pyare Ali asked Khatib Saheb for his opinion.
('55', 502, 1, 9, 957561) The latter said that Islam does not approve of the erection of tombs.
('55', 502, 1, 10, 957631) You should, therefore, put a few blocks of stones on the spot to mark it off and to prevent the ground being used for any purpose.
('55', 502, 1, 11, 957762) Take or send some Muslim to the place and ask him to arrange a few stones.
('55', 502, 1, 12, 957837) If there is no objection to our laying them, somebody from among ourselves may arrange them.
('55', 502, 1, 13, 957930) Silence Day, June 13, 1932 I got you letter today.
('55', 502, 1, 14, 957981) Since tomorrow (Tuesday) is a holiday, I will dispatch the post today.
('55', 502, 1, 15, 958052) Read the letter which I have written to Sitala Sahay 1 .
('55', 502, 1, 16, 958109) However, in the end do what you think proper.
('55', 502, 1, 17, 958155) I think it is best that in this matter I should not decide from here what should be done.
('55', 502, 1, 18, 958245) I will approve of whatever you do.
('55', 502, 1, 19, 958280) I may not even have the necessary data for taking a correct decision.
('55', 502, 1, 20, 958350) Where is Madhavlal at present?
('55', 502, 1, 21, 958381) I thought he was in jail.
('55', 502, 1, 22, 958407) But I hear from Vithal that he is not in Jail.
('55', 502, 1, 23, 958454) I am not sending any article this week.
('55', 502, 1, 24, 958494) I have no time to write one, and moreover, this letter to you has become something like an article The plaster on the left arm has been removed.
('55', 502, 1, 25, 958639) There has been no improvement.
('55', 502, 1, 26, 958670) The cause of the pain, therefore, must be something else.
('55', 502, 1, 27, 958728) But there is no cause whatever for worry.
('55', 502, 1, 28, 958770) Mirabehn is on saltless diet at present, and therefore, had been pressing me to adopt it.
('55', 502, 1, 29, 958860) I started it yesterday.
('55', 502, 1, 30, 958884) For me it is childs play to live on such diet, for I

('55', 503, 4, 6, 959245) 572. LETTER TO BHARATI
('55', 503, 5, 7, 959268) June 13, 1932 I got your letter 1 written in beautiful handwriting.
('55', 503, 5, 8, 959336) I cannot have too many such letters.
('55', 503, 5, 9, 959373) I would certainly be pleased if you brothers and sisters became as strong and sturdy as steel and could endure heat and cold.
('55', 503, 5, 10, 959499) But I cannot all at once make such and experiment on you in the heat (sic) of Simla.
('55', 503, 5, 11, 959584) Training in such endurance would be fruitful only if it is undergone methodically and step by step.
('55', 503, 5, 12, 959684) It is a grave error to believe that a person who generally lives a sheltered life can suddenly become hardened when the need arises.
('55', 503, 5, 13, 959817) That would be going against nature.
('55', 503, 5, 14, 959853) I remember hundreds of instances of persons who made such mistakes.
('55', 503, 5, 15, 959921) I would certainly enjoy reading literature.
('55', 503, 5, 16, 959965) During my school days I could not read anything outside the syllabus.
('55', 503, 5, 17, 960035) After that I got involved in so may activities one after another that I could get little time to read,.
('55', 503, 5, 18, 960139) Whatever I did read was in jails.
('55', 503, 5, 19, 960173) But I do not think that I have lost much because of this.
('55', 503, 5, 20, 960231) I got a great deal of time for thinking.
('55', 503, 5, 21, 960272) And, moreover, what one learns in the school of experience is always more useful than reading.
('55', 503, 5, 22, 960367) Even those who profess to cultivate art for its own sake are not really able to do so.
('55', 503, 5, 23, 960454) Art has a place in life though what is art is a different question.
('55', 503, 5, 24, 960522) But, art and such other things are mere means in the path that we with to tread.
('55', 503, 5, 25, 960603) When they become ends in themselves they become shackles and drag us down.
('55', 503, 5, 26, 960678) God is Truth.
('55', 503, 5, 27, 960692) For the past few years I have been saying that Truth is God instead of saying that God is Truth.
('55', 503, 5, 28, 960789) I feel that this is a more logical way of putting it.
('55', 503, 5, 29, 960843) Truth is the only reality in this world.
('55', 503, 5, 30, 960884) Here Truth should be given a wider connotation.
('55', 503, 5, 31, 960932) It is something living.
('55', 503, 5, 32, 960956) This Truth that is God and the laws of God are not distinct
('55', 503, 6, 33, 961016) 1 The addressee had asked Gandhiji whether he was interested in literature, whether art could be pursued for its own sake and what his concept of God was.

('55', 504, 1, 3, 961258) Hence Truth, too, is a living thing.
('55', 504, 1, 4, 961295) Thus it means the same thing to say that this world is governedby Truth or by Gods laws.
('55', 504, 1, 5, 961384) There is infinite power in that Truth.According to Chapter X of the Gita, it may be said that the world is sustained by just a fraction of that power.
('55', 504, 1, 6, 961535) You will, therefore, understand that I mean by God if you read, Truth wherever the word God occurs.
('55', 504, 1, 7, 961635) If God existsthough we call Him Truthit is our duty to worship Him.
('55', 504, 1, 8, 961703) We become like that which we worship.
('55', 504, 1, 9, 961741) Prayer means nothing more than this.
('55', 504, 1, 10, 961778) But does not that meaning of prayer explain everything?
('55', 504, 1, 11, 961834) Truth dwells in our hearts, but we are not aware, or fully aware of the fact.
('55', 504, 1, 12, 961912) This awareness comes through sincere prayer.
('55', 504, 2, 13, 961957) Do you find it difficult to read my handwriting?
('55', 504, 2, 14, 962006) The envelope in which this letter is sealed was made by Sardar.

('55', 504, 7, 21, 962310) There was no reason whatsoever for you to feel hurt.
('55', 504, 7, 22, 962363) The question which I asked you, I put to all grown up girls.
('55', 504, 7, 23, 962424) If any girl wishes to get married, I regard that as natural.
('55', 504, 7, 24, 962485) Would it not be better to tell me frankly rather than repine inwardly?
('55', 504, 7, 25, 962556) But I am certainly pleased if a girl does not wish to get married.
('55', 504, 7, 26, 962623) I asked you so that you may have no fear on that account.
('55', 504, 7, 27, 962681) If, however, you positively do not, at present, wish to get married, that is indeed the best.
('55', 504, 7, 28, 962775) You should know, however, that in order to preserve such purity, it is very necessary to cultivate devotion to God and to keep oneself engaged in some work for the service of people.
('55', 504, 7, 29, 962958) All of you should improve your health.

('55', 506, 8, 16, 964943) Indeed by a long course of habit I have lost all curiosity.

('55', 507, 2, 3, 965550) June 15, 1932
('55', 507, 3, 4, 965564) BHAU, I could not reply to your letter of the 6th last week.
('55', 507, 3, 5, 965625) Meanwhile, I got another letter from you this week.
('55', 507, 3, 6, 965677) I understand your reason for discontinuing to send Vinobas discourses.
('55', 507, 3, 7, 965748) His prohibition is right.
('55', 507, 3, 8, 965774) Yes, there was some misunderstanding on my part regarding the paintings of scenes from the Ramayana.
('55', 507, 3, 9, 965875) I do not see anything objectionable in meditating over a figure drawn as purely imaginary.
('55', 507, 3, 10, 965966) If, however, meditating on the Gita can satisfy you, where is the need for any other object of meditation?
('55', 507, 3, 11, 966073) There are two ways of meditating on the Gita.
('55', 507, 3, 12, 966119) Since we look upon the Gita as Mother, you may meditate on a painting or photograph of your mother, you require one (and if your mother is dead), thinking of her as the kamadhenu 1
('55', 507, 4, 13, 966300) in the form of the Gita.
('55', 507, 4, 14, 966325) Alternatively, you may have an imaginary picture of the Gita in your mind.
('55', 507, 4, 15, 966400) You may even think of her as Mother Cow.
('55', 507, 4, 16, 966441) I think it would be better if you could follow the second way.
('55', 507, 4, 17, 966504) You may, at that time, meditate on any verse or phrase from the chapter of the Gita which you may have recited on that day or from any other chapter.
('55', 507, 4, 18, 966654) All the words in the Gita are so many ornaments on the body of Mother Gita and, therefore, meditating on any one of them amounts of meditating on the Gita herself, just as meditating on an ornament worn by the woman whom one loves amounts to meditating on herself.
('55', 507, 4, 19, 966919) But one may also meditate on the Gita in any other way that one can think of.
('55', 507, 4, 20, 966997) There are as many ways as there are brains.
('55', 507, 4, 21, 967041) No two persons meditate in the same way even on one and the same object.
('55', 507, 4, 22, 967114) There will always be some difference between the exact pitures of the object imagined by them and their descriptions of it.
('55', 507, 4, 23, 967238) According to Chapter VI, even the least sadhana is not wasted, and we resume our sadhana in our next life from the point where we had stopped.
('55', 507, 4, 24, 967381) Similarly, a person who desires to turn towards spiritual living but lacks the necessary strength for the purpose will have greater strength of mind in his next life.
('55', 507, 4, 25, 967548) I have no doubt about this at all in my mind, but it does not mean that we can relax our effort in this life.
('55', 507, 4, 26, 967658) If we think in that manner, our desire for a spiritual living is

('55', 508, 0, 1, 967774) VOL. 55 : 10 FEBRUARY, 1932 15 JUNE, 1932 509
('55', 508, 1, 2, 967820) not sincere.
('55', 508, 1, 3, 967833) Or, it is a desire of the intellect and not of the heart, and a desire of the intellect has no value at all.
('55', 508, 1, 4, 967942) It will not survive ones death.
('55', 508, 1, 5, 967974) On the other hand, a desire which has been accepted by the heart cannot but inspire sincere effort to fulfil it, though it is quite possible that owing to various cirmustances or weakness of the body our desire may not be fulfilled during this life.
('55', 508, 1, 6, 968224) We have experience of this every day.
('55', 508, 1, 7, 968262) But the desire will cling to the soul when it leaves the body, and in the next life the difficulties which stood in the way of itsfulfilment during this life will diminish and the desire will be fulfilled or will at least become stronger.
('55', 508, 1, 8, 968501) Thus a person who aspires after spiritual life is ever advancing.
('55', 508, 1, 9, 968567) It may be that Jnaneshwar Maharaj meditated on Nivrittinath 1
('55', 508, 2, 10, 968629) while the latter was alive, but I am strongly of the view that we should not follow his example.
('55', 508, 2, 11, 968726) If we meditate on a person, he must have attained perfection.
('55', 508, 2, 12, 968788) It is altogether improper, and also unnecessary to ascribe perfection to a living human being.
('55', 508, 2, 13, 968883) It is possible, however, that Jnaneshwar Maharaj did not meditate on the real Nivrittinath, but meditated on the perfect Nivrittinath of his imagination.
('55', 508, 2, 14, 969037) But why should we need at all concern ourselves with this problem?
('55', 508, 2, 15, 969104) when the question is about the propriety of meditating on a living human being, we need not bring in the question of meditating on our mental image of that person and any reply on the propriety of that is likely to confuse the reason of the other person.
('55', 508, 2, 16, 969359) The names which are given Chapter I are, according to me, more the names of certain qualities than of real persons.
('55', 508, 2, 17, 969475) While describing the divine and the demoniac forces in our nature, the poet has personified them.
('55', 508, 2, 18, 969573) In saying this, I do not deny the possibility of an actual battle between Kauravas and Pandavas having taken place near Hastinapur.
('55', 508, 2, 19, 969705) My belief is that the poet took a well knwon event of that age as an example and used it as material for his immortal work.
('55', 508, 2, 20, 969829) I may be mistaken in this belief and all those names may be the names of real persons.
('55', 508, 2, 21, 969916) If so, it was not improper for the poet to give those names at the commencement of his historical narrative, and, since the first chapter is necessary for introducing the subject, it is necessary to recite it as part of ceremonial recitation of the Gita.
('55', 508, 2, 22, 970171) If we spin with slivers made by somebody else, our spinning yajna is certainly imperfect.
('55', 508, 2, 23, 970261) A person like me may not be able to make his own slivers at present owing to physical weakness, but those

('55', 509, 1, 2, 970450) who can should make their own slivers.
('55', 509, 1, 3, 970489) I consider it necessary for everybody to learn spinning on the takli and gain mastery over it.
('55', 509, 1, 4, 970584) I know that Vinoba regards it as a much easier means for the yajna of spinning.
('55', 509, 1, 5, 970664) I have not come to a final decision about this, nor do I wish to do so without discussing the matter at length with Vinoba.
('55', 509, 1, 6, 970788) I am, therefore, not particular either way.
('55', 509, 1, 7, 970832) You should, however, discuss your suggestion with Narandas.
('55', 509, 1, 8, 970892) I also will do so.

('55', 509, 6, 13, 971082) MANU 1, I got your letter.
('55', 509, 6, 14, 971109) I cannot understand why you did not get the letter that was sent with my letter to Jamnadas 2 .
('55', 509, 6, 15, 971205) Your courage is being tested fairly well.
('55', 509, 6, 16, 971247) But there is nothing to be afraid of.
('55', 509, 6, 17, 971285) You should tell very plainly that you have been living with Ba and Bali since childhood, and that you do not with to live with Harilal at all.
('55', 509, 6, 18, 971428) Even parents cannot claim custody of grown up children.
('55', 509, 6, 19, 971484) Hence it depends on your own wish where you will live.
('55', 509, 6, 20, 971539) Nobody can force you to marry against your will.
('55', 509, 6, 21, 971588) You should, therefore, always remember that it is in your own power to save yourself.
('55', 509, 6, 22, 971674) I can write in this way and give you courage, but as prisoner I cannot give anything in newspapers.
('55', 509, 6, 23, 971774) Nor will my letters help you in the court.
('55', 509, 6, 24, 971817) But rest assured that you will need no such help.
('55', 509, 7, 25, 971867) Blessings from

('55', 510, 1, 2, 972126) 580. A LETTER
('55', 510, 2, 3, 972140) June 15, 1932 Like you, some others also believe that I live a life of self control and observe brahmacharya, and that, therefore, I was sure to live long.
('55', 510, 2, 4, 972296) This belief about me is not correct, or it is correct only partially in contrast with how other people live.
('55', 510, 2, 5, 972405) I indulged in sexual pleasure nearly up to the age of 30. Nor can I claim that I exercised self control in eating.
('55', 510, 2, 6, 972520) I used to eat all kinds of delicacies for themere pleasure of the palate.
('55', 510, 2, 7, 972594) Then I steadily drifted towards restrain.
('55', 510, 2, 8, 972636) But this does not mean at all that I have overcome the cravings of the senses.
('55', 510, 2, 9, 972715) All I can claim is that I have learnt to hold them under control.
('55', 510, 2, 10, 972781) Thus, self indulgence had already had its effect on my body, but it has been counteracted in the measure that I have acquired self control.
('55', 510, 2, 11, 972921) My contemporaries who do not exercise even that much self control naturally wonder at my self control such as it is and do not observe my weakness.
('55', 510, 3, 12, 973069) The privileges which I enjoy as a prisoner are not because of my being placed in a particular class.
('55', 510, 3, 13, 973170) I am not treated as an ordinary convict.
('55', 510, 3, 14, 973211) Prisoners of my category 2 are entitled to many privileges.
('55', 510, 3, 15, 973271) This, of course, is no defence of what I do.
('55', 510, 3, 16, 973316) Though the Government does give certain privileges to a prisoner like me, it certainly depends on the prisoner himself whether or not to avail himself of those privileges.
('55', 510, 3, 17, 973488) Hence the misunderstanding which you mention is quite natural.
('55', 510, 3, 18, 973551) But I regard it in public interest to continue to avail myself of the privileges even at the risk of incurring such a misunderstanding.
('55', 510, 3, 19, 973687) But it should not be necessary for me to defend this point of view.
('55', 510, 3, 20, 973755) Its correctness should be self evident.
('55', 510, 3, 21, 973795) Even if it is not, I should cling to it so long as I believe it to be earnest.
('55', 510, 3, 22, 973874) This reasoning applies to every captain of a ship.
('55', 510, 3, 23, 973925) A captain cannot always explain the reasons for the cours which he is following.
('55', 510, 3, 24, 974006) But he would not deserve to be a captain if he listens to the advice of others and give up what he believes to be the right course.
('55', 510, 3, 25, 974138) Such captains are known to have wrecked on rocks the ships under their charge.
('55', 510, 3, 26, 974217) Hence persons like you may certainly caution me whenever they have doubt about the propriety of my actions.
('55', 510, 3, 27, 974325) If, however, I do not change my policy even after that, they should have faith that what I am doing is right.
('55', 510, 3, 28, 974435) It does happen

('55', 511, 1, 2, 974670) sometimes that such faith proves to be misplaced.
('55', 511, 1, 3, 974720) But there is no other way of managing public affairs.
('55', 511, 1, 4, 974774) At the moment I am confident that, when I feel that I ought not to avail myself of a particular privilege or of any of them, I shall have the strength to renounce it or them.
('55', 511, 1, 5, 974949) In South Africa I spent fairly long periods of imprisonment as an ordinary prisoner.
('55', 511, 1, 6, 975034) From whom did you hear that story about Krishnadas 1?
('55', 511, 1, 7, 975088) There is no truth in it at all.
('55', 511, 1, 8, 975120) Krishnadas was certainly not sent away.
('55', 511, 1, 9, 975160) For somereasons he himself asked for leave to go.
('55', 511, 1, 10, 975210) But though he has left, our relations have remained the same.
('55', 511, 1, 11, 975272) It is against my nature to take any such step at somebodys instigation.
('55', 511, 1, 12, 975344) And nobody instigated me to take such a step in regard to Krishnadas.
('55', 511, 1, 13, 975414) All the same I wish to know the source of this story.
('55', 511, 1, 14, 975468) If you think you can tell me, please let me know.

('55', 512, 4, 5, 975699) April 13, 1932
('55', 512, 5, 6, 975714) DEAR MR. GANDHI,
('55', 512, 6, 7, 975731) I write this in answer to your letter of 11th March and I say at once I realize fully the strength of your feeling upon the question of separate electorates for the Depressed Classes.
('55', 512, 6, 8, 975915) I can only say that we intend to give any decision that may be necessary solely and only upon the merits of the case.
('55', 512, 6, 9, 976033) As you are aware, Lord Lothians Committee has not yet completed its tour and it must be some weeks before we can receive any conclusions at which it may have arrived.
('55', 512, 6, 10, 976200) When we receive the report we shall have to give most careful consideration to its recommendations and we shall not give a decision until we have taken into account in addition to the view expressed by the Committee the views that you and those who think with you have so forcibly expressed.
('55', 512, 6, 11, 976492) I feel sure if you were in our position you would be taking exactly the same action we intend to take.
('55', 512, 6, 12, 976595) You would await the Committees report, you would then give it your fullest consideration and before arriving at a final decision you would take into account the views that have been expressed on both sides of the controversy.
('55', 512, 6, 13, 976821) More than this I cannot say.
('55', 512, 6, 14, 976850) Indeed I do not imagine you would expect me to say more.
('55', 512, 6, 15, 976907) As to the Ordinances, I can only repeat what I have already said both publicly and privately.
('55', 512, 6, 16, 977001) I am convinced that it was essential to impose them in the face of the deliberate attack upon the very foundations of orderly government.
('55', 512, 6, 17, 977139) I am also convinced that both the Government of India and the local Governments are not abusing their extensive powers and are doing everything possible to prevent excessive or vindictive action.
('55', 512, 6, 18, 977335) We shall not keep the Emergency measures in force any longer than we are obliged to for the purpose of maintaining the essentials of law and order and protecting our officials and other classes of the community against terrorist outrages.

('55', 514, 2, 4, 979307) 2. The interviews not to be treated by either side as a means of enquiring into the treatment or conduct of other prisoners in the Jail.
('55', 514, 2, 5, 979444) The Jail arrangements, discipline and political subjects not to be discussed.
('55', 514, 2, 6, 979522) 3. The interviews to take place in the office of the Superintendent of the Prison.

('55', 514, 12, 16, 979861) April 8, 1932
('55', 514, 13, 17, 979875) Received a letter from Mirabehn with 24 pages, every line of it instinct with spotless devotion.
('55', 514, 13, 18, 979972) She would not be happy unless she lived with and rendered personal service to Bapu.
('55', 514, 13, 19, 980056) But Bapu wants her to get rid of this desire, as otherwise she would feel herself stranded when Bapu was no more with us.
('55', 514, 13, 20, 980178) This controversy has been on ever since Mirabehn came to India.
('55', 514, 13, 21, 980242) In todays letter she has poured out her wonderfully transparent heart: Bapu, I am never without that thought in my mind, as to how best to serve you.
('55', 514, 13, 22, 980392) I think and pray and reason with myself, and it always ends the same way in my heart of hearts.
('55', 514, 13, 23, 980488) When you are taken from us, as in jail, an instinct impels me to work with all my strength at outward service of your cause.
('55', 514, 13, 24, 980613) I feel no doubt and no difficulty.
('55', 514, 13, 25, 980648) When you are with us, an equally strong instinct impels me to retire into silent

('55', 515, 1, 2, 980806) personal servicetrying to do anything else, I feel lost and futile.
('55', 515, 1, 3, 980874) The capacity for the former depends on the fulfilment of the latter.
('55', 515, 1, 4, 980943) The one is the counterpart of the other, and something continually tells me that it was for fulfilment in that way that I was led to you.
('55', 515, 1, 5, 981081) The instinct is so strong that I cannot get round it or through it or over it.
('55', 515, 1, 6, 981160) It is difficult to ask you to have faith in it as the full proof of its correctness can only leave it at that.
('55', 515, 1, 7, 981271) This much I know full well that during this struggle my strength, capacity and inner peace and happiness are much greater than last time, because I had been able to serve according to my instinct (except for one short spell of anguish since your previous release).
('55', 515, 1, 8, 981536) The fact that I was on the point of a breakdown when I came here had nothing to do with this question.
('55', 515, 1, 9, 981639) It was sheer over work, because when I saw that I was shortly going to be arrested, I simply spent my strength recklessly, knowing an enforced rest was coming.
('55', 515, 1, 10, 981799) And there was more than enough work around me to be reckless over.
('55', 515, 1, 11, 981866) Who knows if it is all delusion!
('55', 515, 1, 12, 981899) But a woman has to go by instinct.
('55', 515, 1, 13, 981934) It is stronger with her than any amount of reason, and her full strength can only be harnessed and brought into service if her nature is able to express itself.
('55', 515, 1, 14, 982095) I have no thought, no care, no longing in all the world except for you (you the causeyou the ideal.) To serve that cause in this life and to reach that ideal in after life, Godwho has brought me from utter darkness to the light of your path will surely not answer my prayers by leaving me now to follow a wrong instinct.
('55', 515, 1, 15, 982416) I have not written all this for the sake of argument, but simply to share with you the result of my ceaseless strivings to (understand) since I have been in jail.

('55', 518, 5, 6, 985686) BENGAL,
('55', 518, 6, 7, 985694) March 22, 1932
('55', 518, 7, 8, 985709) From the depths of the present atmosphere of suffering the cry has come for the inauguration of a new age of faith and reconciliation, for a fellowship of understanding between races and nations alienated by cruel politics and diplomacy.
('55', 518, 7, 9, 985947) We in India are ready for a fundamental change in our affairs which will bring harmony and understanding into our relationships with those who have inevitably been brought near to us.
('55', 518, 7, 10, 986131) We are waiting for a gesture of goodwill from both sides, spontaneous and generous in its faith in humanity, which will create a future of moral federation, of constructive works of public good, of the inner harmony of peace between the peoples of India and England.
('55', 518, 7, 11, 986398) The visit of our friends from England has confirmed the immediate possibility of such an intimate fellowship and truth in our mutual relationship, and I feel called upon to appeal to all who have the welfare of humanity at heart to come forward at this critical hour and courageously take upon themselves the task of fulfilling the moral responsibility, which is before us, of building upon the bare foundation of faith or acceptance of truth in a spirit of generous mutual forgiveness.
('55', 518, 7, 12, 986885) The memory of the past, however painful it may have been for us all, should never obscure the vision of the perfect, of the future which it is for us jointly to create.
('55', 518, 7, 13, 987054) Indeed, our experience of the futility of suspicion and hostility must inspire us with a profounder belief in the truth of the simple fellowship of hearts, in the mighty power of creative understanding between individuals as well as nations inspired by a common urge of love.
